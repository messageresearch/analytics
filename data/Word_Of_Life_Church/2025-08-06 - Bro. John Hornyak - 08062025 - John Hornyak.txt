And we like that, don't we? Yes, we do. Amen. Sing it, buddy. [Music] When all foundations have been shaken. When I'm left standing in the dark. When I'm in the pillow, heart is breaking. You still rain and you're still God. And when it feels all hope is gone, heavy questions so hard. And though my soul may feel forsaken, you still reign and you're still God. And though I can't see what's before me, [Music] I know that you can trust your heart. [Music] And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] I will declare you with my faith. Though voices whisper that you're not, you'll never leave me nor forsake me. But you still reign and you're still God. And though I can't see what's before me, [Music] I know I can trust you with your heart. And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] And though I can't see what's before me, I know I can trust you with my heart. And this one truth will be my story. [Music] You still reign and you're still God. [Music] And when my enemy surrounds me, I trust the victory of your cross and fix my eyes upon you, Jesus. For you are God and I am not. [Music] And though I can't see what's before me, I know that I can trust your heart. And this one truth will be my story. [Music] You still reign and you still God.

You still reign and you're still God. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Ask the brothers to put this on the screen. I I really didn't want to sing this by myself. Um, last time I sung his song, it was during the prayer line and I battled singing it cuz I stood there and I was like, "This is not a congregational song. This is not a congregational song." And then Aaron, he looked at me and he's like, "All right, it's your time to I was like, this is not a congregational song." And then everybody proved me wrong and said, "This was this is a very good congregational song. So, if you'll help me sing it. If you've been walking the same old road for miles and miles. If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the same old lies. If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside, there's a better life. There's a better life. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. If you need freom, save it. He's a prison shaking savior. If you got chains, he's a chain breaker. [Music] We've all searched for the light of day in the dead of night. And we've all found ourselves worn out from the same old fire. And we've all run to things we know just ain't right. But there's a better life. There's a better life. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. If you need freedom, save it. He's a prison shaking savior. If you got change, he's a chain breaker. [Music] If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it, somebody testify. If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it. Somebody testify. Testify. If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it, somebody testify you got pain. He's a pain. If you feel lost, he's a way. And you need freedom for savior. He's a prison shaking savior. You got change. He's a chain breaker. Sing that course again. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. You need freedom, a savior. He's a prison shaking savior. God change. He's a change of beauty, freedom, a s. He's a prison shaking savior. Got chains. He's a chain breaker. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is he your chain breaker? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's good to be here. I just pray that you come expecting. &gt;&gt; You know, I've said it before. Not too high. I can't do this. He can. &gt;&gt; It's like you can't sit there, but he can. &gt;&gt; Right. You're not going to get anything if you just sit there. You come expecting. What am I doing? Uh if you don't come expecting, you're just come to a building. But if you come expecting, then he's going to speak to you. Amen. God bless you. If you would turn with me to Genesis, Genesis 12. We're going to read several places, Lord willing. Verses 1 and three. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful to you, Lord. We love you so much and we thank you, Lord Jesus, that you've called us. And Lord, not only did you call us, Lord, but you give us the grace to respond to that call, Father. And Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to you, Lord. We see you in every avenue of our lives, Lord. Lord, even when we're doing wrong, we we've got the grace to have you, Lord, tell us that we're wrong. We're so thankful for that, Lord. There's many people that do wrong and don't even know it, Father. Lord, as the bride of Christ, we're so blessed, Father. And Lord Jesus, tonight we're here, Lord, not to see one another. Although it's nice to see everybody, Lord, but we've come to see you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And we have to look past the veil many times, Lord. And tonight is is another night that we're we're asking that you would help not only myself look past the veil, Lord, and help me to understand that I'm speaking to God in flesh, but I'm asking that they would look past this veil and understand that God in flesh is speaking to them. Father, I pray that you would just take control of this service, Lord. You know what's on my heart. You know, Lord Jesus, that I've studied and I've looked at this, Lord. And well, to be honest, Lord, if my thoughts are here, I I don't want them. I just want you to have your way, Lord. I I pray that you would take these things and just make them and custom fit each and every individual. Lord, we love you and we thank you for it, Lord. We ask it in your name. Amen. Thank you for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord willing, I'm going to speak on destroying all hope. Um destroying all hope. Um I know hope is faced, little sister, and it's important, but I I think sometimes that God wants us to destroy the hope and get to faith. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hope waivers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We've hoped for a lot of things in our lives, but when you have that faith that comes from God, it don't waver. &gt;&gt; It don't waver. And and another thing about hope, and I was just praying and thinking about this, you know, a Christian's faith doesn't determine the outcome. A real Christian's faith doesn't determine God's will. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? So, we can have all the faith in the world and we can really believe and we we've seen it even here in this church. We've really believed for Sister Erica. That didn't that didn't waver what God's will was. &gt;&gt; We were following general orders, right? &gt;&gt; We were doing exactly what God called us to do. just believe because there's nowhere in the scripture that says have faith and so and so is going to pass away. That's that's not what's in the scripture this have faith. &gt;&gt; But as a Christian, we have faith in God that his will will be done. as a real Christian. The ones that that fall away from from from God and Christianity are the ones that that say they have faith and they might actually have faith, but they don't have faith that God is going to do his perfect will. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just keep that in mind. if we're going to I I I preached this in in Monosel a couple weeks ago, but the Lord's kind of turned it and we'll see how far he turned it. You know what I'm saying? Amen. Now the Lord said had said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee, and I will make thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will make thee a great nation." Now, this is Abram, still not father of nations. This is just Abram. So, he's putting that promise forth, right? &gt;&gt; Believe it, receive it. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Uh he will heal the sick. He will, you know, you I I've called you to prosper and be in good health. All those promises. There's a promise right here. &gt;&gt; And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that cursth thee. And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. Man, that's a lot of that's a lot of promises right there. That's a lot of things. That's that's God putting his for his word forth. He's sewing forth. I don't want to wear you out. Go ahead and be seated. Let me stand for a little while. You go ahead. Now, we're going to turn to to Genesis 13 uh 14- 16. And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place with thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward. So we see here that God has he he made the promise. He made the promise and it's out there, but he's still not the father of nations. &gt;&gt; And there was things that he had to do. Now, now Abram believed God, right? &gt;&gt; He believed God. He was there. The faith was there. He had a supernatural interaction with God. &gt;&gt; Just like every one of you, if you're real Christians, you've had a supernatural interaction with God with your salvation. That's something supernatural. Logically, humanity doesn't see this unknown being, right? &gt;&gt; And he doesn't see how in the world that he could save us &gt;&gt; naturally. But you've had a super something supernatural happen to you that you believe in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have a supernatural interaction with God. So, we're we're we're believing. That's faith. We believe in that. That's faith. But Abram had to separate from Lot. He had to start getting things out of his life that were interfering. Right. And so he's moved from justification, being called &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; into sanctification, getting cleaned up. &gt;&gt; Right. But it still doesn't make him a father of nations. &gt;&gt; It's still not producing the seed. &gt;&gt; Right. justification, sanctification. For all the land which thou seeest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that the man so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. So here he is repeating again. That's why we come to church. This ain't nothing new, brothers and sisters. I'm not here to surprise you with with new word. That's if I am, then you need to get me out of here because there ain't you know that's not right. This this is not new. I'm just maybe bringing in a different way or or I can express it in a way in in a moment in your life right now that you'll see it better. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm not bringing anything new. &gt;&gt; So Abram is God is dealing with Abram the same way. He's telling him over and over again, your seed. You'll be blessed. You're the father of nations, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Abram's like, "Okay, all right. I I'm seeing it." And as now, Abram, sanctify yourself. All right. I can do that. I'm going to separate myself. Now, I'm a little hard-headed. It's going to take me a while. We can't go through the whole whole scripture. And I don't know anybody else like that. But old Abram, bless his heart, he was a little hard-headed. It took him a while. We know the story. I We don't have time to to rehash all that, but you understand where I'm coming from. And this these are not the these are just a couple points that that I picked up. Now, let's go to Genesis 18 verse 10. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and wellstricken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. So, here's that promise all those years ago and it's been repeated and it's been told and Abram was still believing &gt;&gt; but he had somebody very close to him &gt;&gt; that their faith had kind of fallen off. &gt;&gt; It kind of fell off. &gt;&gt; She's like, "Well, that was nice." &gt;&gt; Oh, Abram, bless his heart. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's kind of it's kind of shaken a little bit. &gt;&gt; We all have those &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; We all have those that we we go through the we we believe and we have this faith and we get sanctified and then we think we come across old friends or our family and they're saying, "Is that message really &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; necessary? Is holiness really necessary?" That's good. &gt;&gt; Do you really have to live that way? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Was a prophet really necessary? I mean, there's plenty of Baptist churches that that have a lot to offer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If if you don't want to go to the Baptist, you can go to the Methodist or the the Pentecostals. Pentecostals. Shout. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and and work it out. I'm a good Christian. I don't know how many times I've heard that. I don't have to believe like that. &gt;&gt; I love God. They have faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They have faith. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; They had to. They believe in Jesus Christ. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But here they are. And those those things whisper in ear. We've had a great falling away from the message. Did they ever have really have faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, they really had faith, but it only come to a spot. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Any anybody that can talk you into something can also talk you out of it. Right. &gt;&gt; There's something in me that I don't care that crazy. I don't I don't understand why in the world people would walk away from this. &gt;&gt; I just don't get it. &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to comprehend. And then I see the ones that have walked away and most of them their lives went &gt;&gt; they lost everything. &gt;&gt; Their dignity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Used to have a standard. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now there's no standard. &gt;&gt; Huh. But they had faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't the faith of God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And they went ahead and took God's permissive will. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I am waxed old, shall I have pleasure with my Lord also?" or being old also doesn't make sense. This don't this don't line up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everybody in the world is is is doing this. I can come in and I can worship God and I can at any old church. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; he did. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. They had faith in that. And the Lord said unto Abram, Abraham, wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of shy bear a child which I am old? And I meant to mention this. It's Sarah and Abraham at this point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; let's just stop right there just for a second. At this point, he's the father of nations. &gt;&gt; And he's got one son, Ishmael, &gt;&gt; it's not the promised son, &gt;&gt; and it's not certainly not of nations, right? &gt;&gt; It's not what God has is has really called him to. He knew that it was supposed to come through Sarah. And Sarah said, "Let me help you out, God." Oh, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; I wish that I could take back all those times that I helped God out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be awesome? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'd be a whole lot further down the road. &gt;&gt; If I would stop helping God out and if I could take back the times that I did help God out, &gt;&gt; preach now, &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir. Oh, the mighty John. Let me help you out, God. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I got this. &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. To take those away. &gt;&gt; And to never do it again. Let's be honest, &gt;&gt; cuz every one of us here, the Lord Terries, is going to try and help him out again cuz we just we're hard-headed and we still got flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Is anything too hard for the Lord? Back in church again. at the appointed time I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son. Uh that the one who doubted the one who questioned the one who shook on her faith in what God really told them or and and and told Sarah you're going to have this child and she laughed at him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And God looked past her ignorance &gt;&gt; because his will will be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Children of God can only fall into permissive will for so long. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's been times I've been in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; There's been too many times I've been in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; However, because I am a son of God, because you are sons and daughters of God and you're the bride of Christ, &gt;&gt; your final act will not be his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It will be his perfect will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let that soak in just a minute. &gt;&gt; There's plenty of people out there that are falling into his permissive will time and time and time again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they'll end up in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But we have real faith. We have something anchored and solid, something that that's going to hold us and keep us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And when all the dust settles and everything shakes out from our hearts, it's going to be yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not my way, Lord. It's your way. &gt;&gt; It's not my will, Lord. It's your will. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it takes, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to take control of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at Genesis 22 verses 1. I got a lot to cover, so we're going to have to verses one through. We're going to try. And it came to pass after the these things that God did did tempt Abraham. What? &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. The devil is the tempter. Not according to this right here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God did tempt Abraham. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Why would God do that? Cuz we need faith at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we need unshakable, unquestioning faith at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; That's why God will tempt us. &gt;&gt; He will shake us. He will question us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. People don't just pick up a basketball and are able to play basketball or baseball or sewing or whatever cooking. Lord, please help us. They don't just go in a kitchen and just make this meal that's just fantastic. Takes practice. Right. &gt;&gt; Takes years of practice. &gt;&gt; Well, what makes you think it that we're just going to step into this faith? &gt;&gt; If God don't have us practice believing what God has for us, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are we just supposed to step into this and say, "Well, I'm here, God. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; I hear your call." &gt;&gt; Wow. True. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a rude awakening when God tempt us. &gt;&gt; It's hard. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And some of those those things go back to that that wanting God's will more than we want our own way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's so easy to pout on God. &gt;&gt; That's good. We all have that lip that can roll right on out. &gt;&gt; We just push that thing out there. You You said you were going to heal me and I had to wait three weeks. &gt;&gt; You said you'd provide my every need. And &gt;&gt; I had to go to the food stamp office. &gt;&gt; Guess what? He did provide your need. Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; Just not the way you wanted, &gt;&gt; right? But we get this attitude against God saying, "Hey, this is the way it should be." &gt;&gt; It's truth. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; But we have to practice that. We have to get into that mode where we struggle sometimes &gt;&gt; and we believe. We really believe. We're taking the word and we're taking it. We're eating it and we're believing saying, "God, you'll provide my every need." And I have to ask somebody for $10 for gas or whatever it might be. &gt;&gt; It's getting tight in here. &gt;&gt; Some of us don't like it. I don't I don't like it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Humble thyself. Okay. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's going to heal me. Yeah. Go to the doctor. Right. There's all kinds of variation of this the same mindset, the same thing that we've had on God because we expect God to do things a certain way because we wanted the miraculous. We wanted the the the spiritual, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We want to hear it from the pulpit and embrace it and and just take it. &gt;&gt; Well, you got to embrace and take this part, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "Take now thy son, thine only son." Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Didn't we say Ishmael was here? &gt;&gt; All those things that we helped with, &gt;&gt; he don't even recognize. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Chalk that up to stupidity. &gt;&gt; I'm not even going to recognize that. That's good. &gt;&gt; And Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and claved the wood, the burnt offerings, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. So Abram, Abraham is making preparation to do exactly what God said. We're walking. He's walking in the word. And every day Abraham has those scriptures. I'll make thy seed as the sands of the sea. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's got those. They're they're tucked away in his heart. He's got those promises &gt;&gt; and he's waiting at any moment for God to intervene because he knows that's what the promise is. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's real faith. &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting God to intervene at any moment. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't waver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith from God wanting his will doesn't shake from one side or the other. But but every step we're saying, "Okay, God, you're leading me this direction. I'm going to go this direction." &gt;&gt; And at any moment, you could step on the scene and change this situation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he says, "Yes, yes, I can." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do next? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says he didn't tell Syria, Sarah, his wife. &gt;&gt; No, he did &gt;&gt; cuz he was afraid that she was going to knock him down. Hm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got two servants and his son and his animal and the wood and he said, "We'll be back in a few days." "Where are you going?" Oh, it's a surprise. He didn't lie and he took off. And at first Abraham said, "Well, maybe if I get everything ready, God will stop me." &gt;&gt; And then God didn't stop him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then he said, "Well, maybe if we head down the road, we start out, then God will have me just turn around. He knew the promise. &gt;&gt; Maybe you woke up with a head cold and and first thing in the morning you said, "Well, Lord, you're my healer. At any moment you could take it away at any time. I'm believing. I'm going to praise you for it." Ah, and you're doing exactly what the word says. Exactly what the word says. I'm going to praise you for it. I'm going to believe for it. By this afternoon, that head coat will be gone. Afternoon comes and goes. Well, I'll believe for it. I'm going to take some nightquil. I'm going to get a good night's sleep. Lord, is it okay if I take nightquil? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My face not shaking. I just I just need to get some sleep, Lord. You wake up in the morning and it's worse. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? This is this is in everything in our lives. We we we I wake up in the morning say, "Lord, come quickly." &gt;&gt; And I have to go through my whole day. This is what's expected of us. We had to go through our whole day expecting him to come in a twinkling in an eye, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What's What's the difference? &gt;&gt; What's the difference between that and what Abraham had to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting. We're supposed to be anticipating his coming and living &gt;&gt; like he can come any moment. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we have to go put our work boots on. &gt;&gt; I wish we could skip that part. &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly, Lord. &gt;&gt; If that's what it takes to get you in that mindset of of even so, come quickly. &gt;&gt; We got to plant our potatoes, too. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. He's called us that. &gt;&gt; Some of them crazy people that that believed that God was coming back in 77 or what it was, went out and got loans and all that and and went into debt and they left the message because he didn't come the way that he &gt;&gt; that that they thought he should come. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; man. There's plenty of loonies out there. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about out there. I'm talking about in the message ranks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Some of these people are crazy. &gt;&gt; But even so, come quickly. But Lord, I I'm going to have to save up for a car in case mine breaks down or whatever more. &gt;&gt; That's real faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's expecting the best. and planning for the worst. &gt;&gt; Nobody likes that side of it. &gt;&gt; I don't like that side of it. I wish it was all gumb gumballs and lollipops and rainbows and whatever else, &gt;&gt; but it's not. Reality is he's called us to a faith. Lord, I want your perfect will. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. And if it's your perfect will for me to go through this trial, this struggle, this low valley, &gt;&gt; even so come quickly. &gt;&gt; Circumstance does not change the bride's outcome. Then on the third day, day three, Abraham so showed him or God showed Abraham where he was supposed to go. It wasn't a quick trip. Three days he started heading in a direction. &gt;&gt; It sounds like life. &gt;&gt; Just heading in a direction. Now, our goal is to get where God called us to be. &gt;&gt; And day by day, &gt;&gt; moment by moment, we're progressing along. We have that faith that God is going to move for us. We have that faith that God is doing something in our lives. And we also have that faith knowing that he's called us to do something that's uncomfortable sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. Can you imagine in I don't know about you, but in with me in my heart when I know I have something that I have to do that I don't like. &gt;&gt; Lord, please help me. Lord, I I don't Lord, you know this is this is not what I had in mind. &gt;&gt; Lord, this is uncomfortable for me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to work with that person again. Lord, I know that you're molding me and making me and you're using that guy and I'm not supposed to ball up my fist. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hey, you're never going to get anything else but brother John up here. I'm sorry. This is just me. I'm not trying to be nothing. I'm not trying to hide from from me. Unfortunately, you can see it. &gt;&gt; Three days, Abraham. Oh, Lord, please help me. I don't know what I don't know what you're doing, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's those times and and Abraham felt like his prayers didn't even get up past the ceiling. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He'd lay there and he's asking, "God, please. I know what you promised. I know what you said. I know that I'm going to be the father of nations." And you said the seed would come through Sarah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you said that it was going to be Isaac. &gt;&gt; And you've called me to go sacrifice him. I I I don't I don't understand. Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe I'm the only one who's ever had the I don't understand thoughts. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't get it. &gt;&gt; And it's human nature to want to understand what's going on. We want to be in control. If we understand it, we can control it a little better. Some of you have been praying for deliverance for years and years from a certain habit, a certain thing. &gt;&gt; Let's just get down to where it is. &gt;&gt; We know in the word it's against his word the the the besetting sin that's hanging on us. We know it's against his word to have this attitude towards somebody or an attitude at all in a certain way. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we're walking along and we struggle with it and we say, "Lord, you said that you deliver me from this and I'm fighting it still." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's against your word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not your will for me to be having this. Some of you it's it's it's doubt that you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Some of you it's things that you hide. Some of you it's things that are very apparent. An attitude. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's a habit. &gt;&gt; It's all these things. You know what your yours is. I know what mine is. &gt;&gt; And we know it's God's will that it's not supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; And we go day by day and we're under we're we're we're we're questioning and we don't understand. We've got these questions. God, why? Why am I here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know I can't serve you the right way with this guilt hanging on me. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I told you it might go in a different direction. Let me tell you, this is a different direction. &gt;&gt; I know this isn't your perfect will. And I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. And yet I still have this thing. &gt;&gt; That's a hard way to be. It's a hard way to live. &gt;&gt; Guilt is an awful thing. And for a Christian that's falling short of the glory of God, that guilt is very prevalent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it should be. &gt;&gt; It should bother you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that Holy Ghost saying, "Hey, you're better than this." &gt;&gt; It's that Holy Ghost saying, "Hey, you're better than this. You mean the Holy Ghost would tempt us?" &gt;&gt; And God did tempt Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He didn't say he was wasn't going to deliver him. Now, Abraham was in the midst of the trial. He didn't know the end. We're we we have the luxury of knowing the end of Abraham's story. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. We have the luxury of knowing the end of your story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's rapture, right? &gt;&gt; It's that perfect word living in us. &gt;&gt; But in the middle of it, what does it feel like? It's so heavy. I don't understand God. Right? &gt;&gt; Why can't I overcome this? God, why are you tempting me this way? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This ain't in my notes. And we know what his perfect will is this in this situation. Just like Abraham knew what his the perfect will was in his situation. &gt;&gt; But it don't always make it easy. &gt;&gt; Guilt don't go away because you know you're not supposed to &gt;&gt; and that you will overcome it. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to have faith that you will. &gt;&gt; That's that's right. But it don't make it easier to deal with. &gt;&gt; Not as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Three days journey. He's still waiting. &gt;&gt; Some of you it's been 10 years journey. You're still waiting. That's tight. &gt;&gt; Come on. Then on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off. Oh, it was like I was telling my son Ben on the way over here. I said, "This is the worst part of the service." I get up here and I I I've been preaching long enough and I've done it enough that I know that if I submit and get out of the way, then he'll take over. This part's easy right now. Now the pre and the post not so fun. The pre you're thinking, "Oh, am I really finding the mind of God?" And then afterwards like, "Boy, you really miss God. It's miserable." &gt;&gt; So Abraham was preparing to take off and he knew that he was going to have to face Sarah and have have to ask her some questions, maybe skirt around a few questions. And then when he saw that a far off, he knew, "Oh, it's coming. It's coming." And Abraham said unto his young men, "Abide here with the ass, and I will and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you." Abra Abraham was tempted of God. Abraham understood the promise. He's still waiting for God to intervene at this moment. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Still waiting for God to intervene. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But he knew the promise and he quoted the promise and he stayed with the promise. I and the lad will return. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's going to happen. I don't know when God's going to step in here, but I know what the promise is. Right, &gt;&gt; brother and sister. Are you glad you know what the promise is? &gt;&gt; Thank God. I'd go crazy if I didn't know the promise. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be able to make it if I didn't know what the promise is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He kept quoting the promise. His testimony was positive. &gt;&gt; Should we stop there for just a minute? His brother Joel Forny says, "Wowy, wowy woo." We get those wowsy wowsy woo moments. Poor me. I can't believe I'm going through this. God, why are you doing this to me? God, you said I was an overcomer. I'm not an overcomer because I'm still dealing. And a testimony and the confession is not what it should be. If you're in the midst of that besetting sin, if you're in the midst of that problem, in that situation, God's still your deliverer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still the one who made the promise, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That doesn't change. &gt;&gt; Circumstance doesn't change. Jonah and the whale, right? Surrounded by b whale belly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; His circumstance didn't dictate the outcome. &gt;&gt; Right. Sure did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The promise was he was going to preach in Nineveh. &gt;&gt; He didn't like it. He didn't want to do it. &gt;&gt; He ran from it. God said, "Guess what? You're going through a pipe, old boy, or a fish in this circumstance. &gt;&gt; Not going to be fun. &gt;&gt; Circumstance didn't change the outcome. Your circumstance, brothers and sisters, will not will not change your outcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; His will is what determines where we end up. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Not our circumstance. &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Not our issues, not our our attitudes, but his will will determine our outcome. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; and Abraham took the the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon his Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and a knife. And they went both of of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, "My father." And he said, "Here am I, my son." And he said, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb for the burnt offering? Lord, you said you were my deliverer. &gt;&gt; You said you were my healer. &gt;&gt; You said I was an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb? &gt;&gt; Where's the sacrifice? By your stripes, I am healed. &gt;&gt; I can't heal you anymore. He can't heal you anymore than he did on the cross. There's a promise. The work was performed. It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Where's my burnt offering, Lord? And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering." So they both for So they went both of them together right up on the hill. Now Isaac was scratching his head too, &gt;&gt; still questioning. And they came to the place where God had told him of. And Abraham built an altar there. And he laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. Following through, following through. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's not going to act ask us to sacrifice our son, &gt;&gt; but he might ask us to sacrifice our pride. &gt;&gt; It's hard to say God's a healer. God's a healer. God's a healer. God's a healer. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the doctor. God's a healer. Right. It's his word. &gt;&gt; It's his word. &gt;&gt; Abraham knew what he was promised. Brothers and sisters, we get so much going on and we've got so much of life happening. &gt;&gt; Life life isn't chaotic anymore. It just happens. &gt;&gt; I'm past the chaos. I'm used to the chaos. Maybe I'm the only one, but I'm used to the chaos. &gt;&gt; It just happens &gt;&gt; and we have to deal with it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God expects us and not only does he expect us to to deal with it, but he expects us to do it well. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I have I've I've I've asked all my kids. This is one of my rules growing up in my house. They don't like it when I preach. It's nothing bad. Don't worry, boys. You need to work in the in the food service or um what's the other thing? Retail. So, you know how to treat somebody when you order food and they get it wrong. Boy, that's hard. Boy, that's hard to do. But if you ever been on the other side of it and guess what? You know how to treat somebody. I can tell the ones that worked in retail, they're all no joke &gt;&gt; cuz we've all had those customers &gt;&gt; and they're always right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you feel like they're just right for knocking out. But we need to be able to treat people with kindness in spite of the problems that we have. And it's frustrating &gt;&gt; and it's hard. &gt;&gt; But we need to learn how to deal with stuff. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; We need to learn how to treat people that aren't Christians. &gt;&gt; Because just because they're not treating you like a Christian would treat you doesn't mean that you shouldn't treat them like a Christian should treat them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be the only Jesus they see &gt;&gt; all day long. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Have you seen some of them characters working in that fast food joint? They ain't seen G Jesus and a lot of them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You might be the only ones. That was free. That wasn't in my notes either. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Here am I." Ah. And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon thy lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearst God." Fearst God. How fierest God. I'm going to keep believing and I'm going to keep trusting. If it's it's so important that we keep the mindset God's knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; But I'm lonely. God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. H. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been sick for this long. God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this besetting sin. I'm an overcomer. It's going to happen. The promise is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that you should just embrace that besetting sense of, "Oh, God's using it. Oh, I No. No. Quite the opposite. You push that thing away and you stomp it and you kick it and you tell it, "I will not. This is not me. &gt;&gt; This is not me." &gt;&gt; I'm not catering to this. &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You ever been in such a place in your life and you've been fighting with something for so long and it seems like and your prayers turn from even so come quickly to Lord, can you wait till I overcome this? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; There won't be a lot of people that admit that, Brother Freddy. But I've been in that place where I've said, "Oh Lord, you're going to have to hold on a couple days till I overcome this cuz I know this ain't right." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's where we are, brothers and sisters. It it it's not supposed to shake us. It's not going to shake us. We're sons and daughters of God. He knows what's best for us. &gt;&gt; We are overcomers. &gt;&gt; We're not always overcomers on our time because our strength is nothing. We can't do it on our own. &gt;&gt; And maybe that's the very point that he's trying to get across to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That might be the whole reason why you're struggling with this thing, whatever it might be, because he wants you to settle in and know that you are nothing &gt;&gt; without him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't overcome anything without him. And maybe he wants you to settle in and say, "God, I give up." &gt;&gt; I'm done. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've had a demon cast out of me by a look of a man of God cuz I was at that point. I was praying about something and struggled and struggled and struggled. And this brother just looked at me. He was under the anointing. He was in a place. He didn't even pray for me. He didn't lay his hands on me. And I knew at that very moment that I was delivered. &gt;&gt; How's that possible? &gt;&gt; I finally said, "God, I've been trying for years. I can't do it. &gt;&gt; Here's a man of God. Here's an opportunity. I I'm giving it to you." Amazing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We've got to get to the place, brothers and sisters, where we realize that it's God and only God. All he wants us to do is believe. &gt;&gt; See the promise and walk towards it. Keep going towards it. Keep going towards it. Keep moving towards it. But I got this circumstance don't matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says in Jehovah Gyra. Now what if Abraham says now wait was that vision true? Let me study now. Was that vision true? Brother Ram saying, is Abraham going to question his experience with God? Something that's settled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's where the devil wants to get you. &gt;&gt; Now, God said for me to take my boy and kill him. Now, how am I ever going to to be the father of nations? And that's my seed. And that's a promise seed. Now, how am I ever going to be the father of nations when God is destroying the only hope I have? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Destroying the only hope that I have. &gt;&gt; Is that the hope? Only hope that I have. No, I still have I still got his word. He promised me back there that he'd do it. And through Isaac, all the world would would be blessed. Through Isaac, all the world would be blessed. &gt;&gt; Through you, all the world will be blessed. The bride is what's holding back &gt;&gt; those demons. &gt;&gt; So he said, listen to Abraham now. I received him as one from the dead. I'm persuaded that God is able to raise him up from the dead. Oh my, even with a a horse throat, I feel religious. So brother Brandham's got a horse throat. If I receive received him as one from the dead, what? Guess what? The garden made us dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we've received him as one from the dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We've received his promise. Don't matter the circumstance. Don't matter how how are we going to make this happen? We're not. &gt;&gt; We're not. God's going to make it happen. &gt;&gt; The seed in his own body was dead at 100 years old. The deadness of Sarah's womb, they were both sterile to being with. And then God performed a miracle and put his germ of life in there. He received him from the dead as one being dead. Then God's able to raise him up from the dead. Perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh my. If that wouldn't make a Presbyterian shout. Think of that. &gt;&gt; So here he is. That's what I That's what I'm We're building our experience through our trials. And God's tempting us. We're building these experiences. &gt;&gt; All these trials. Look, I'm going through some hard stuff. Harder than I've ever had to go through. And as a Christian, you could all say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Going through some hard stuff, and it's harder now than it ever has been. &gt;&gt; But you know what the difference is? I'm not near as worried as I used to be about it. &gt;&gt; I'm not near as concerned about how the outcome's going to be as I used to be. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God tempted me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he followed through with his word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And after every victory, my faith got bigger. &gt;&gt; After every victory, I come back and said, "Well, God, you did this for me. Is it too hard for God?" My &gt;&gt; Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise to his name. I'm going to switch gears a little bit and and just look at Philippians 2. Verse one. Now I got to make it fast. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, any if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels of mercy, fulfill ye my joy, that ye may be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, one mind. So what's God's mind for you? What is if if we're called to have the same mind of Christ, what is his goal? What is his purpose? What is his whole what is he waiting for us to get his mind? And we know that the prophet said he's under greater anticipation to call us home than we are &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to go home. That's his mindset, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he's called us to have that mindset. We're going home. &gt;&gt; Well, brother John, what? We can't go with all these circumstances. No, we're going home. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how we get there. what we have to overcome to get there. We're going to get there. &gt;&gt; That's that's God's mindset, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's what he sees. Does he see me fall short? Yes. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Does he see you fall short? &gt;&gt; Has he thrown you out? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, forget it. That guy, I'm telling you, I have worked on him and worked on him and worked on him. You know, we'll just start over with somebody else. No, he has that image in his mind that he had of you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to fill out that per that that picture album and you're going to be there &gt;&gt; in spite of you." &gt;&gt; Watch how I could sing, "My God is an awesome God." Why? Because I know &gt;&gt; that he's put up with me. How awesome is that? &gt;&gt; My wife and kids don't even want to do that sometimes. But he keeps putting up with me. &gt;&gt; And we've all had those moments where we're saying, "God, why do you put up with me? I'm just going to take this and just because it's encouraging. I just want to I want to take this little I don't this is the way the Lord's leading me. So, we're going to I put it in here and I didn't understand why, but we're just going to do it. It's a I perceive that thou art a prophet. It's 53. Brother Brown says, "And coming down through the people." Now, now you all heard this before. I'm not telling you anything new, but I I want to stir it up, make you understand. Coming down through the people. Now, down in the south, they have the the Jim Crow law. That is colored and white can't mix together. So here come a a a colored girl about 17 18 years old and oh she was in her this her her eyes was white with cataract as my shirt and she was coming pressing through the crowds somebody please help me daddy and I thought why don't some of these people help that poor girl so I thought while he wasn't looking I'd move along a little so I got over there and I kept getting right in her way and watching ing these men to come. And she came right up and I stood like that and she bumped into me. She her hands tugged me. She said, "Excuse me, sir. Excuse me." Said, "Daddy." I thought I said, "What are you looking for?" She said, "Sir, I've lost my daddy. I'm blind." She said, "I can't find him. I don't know what to do." Said, "Nobody will help me." Will you help me, kind sir? H &gt;&gt; will you help me con sir? &gt;&gt; So this is a a black girl and it was okay back then. It wasn't that's what black folks want to be called was colored. So don't get all crazy with that. That's what they maybe they didn't want to but that's what they were called. She's in a group of white people, blind, and lost her only way home, her daddy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Tough circumstances. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I said, "Well, I don't see no more color people around here." Said, "Where are you from?" She said, "Memphis." &gt;&gt; So, he's bringing forth. He said, "Look, you're in a you're in a dangerous spot right now. You're a black girl in a white crowd. This is not a nice place. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz cuz a lot of them racist claim Christianity, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And shame on them, &gt;&gt; back then and now. Let's go ahead and say it. &gt;&gt; And I looked and there was a bunch of charter buses sitting there and I knowed one of them was from Memphis. And that's how I said, "What are you doing over here?" She said, "I listening to the radio this morning." She said, "I heard about all those deaf and dumb people they had up there that was deaf and dumb last night speaking on the radio." And I said, "And you're blind?" See? I said, "What'd you come over here for?" She said, "I come to see the healer." I said, "The what?" She said, "The healer." And I said, "You don't believe that, do you?" &gt;&gt; Hm. Sounds like she's tempting. You're getting tempted. The prophet is tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; This is God called man tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; You don't believe that? &gt;&gt; H Yeah. He says, "Now that looked like a hypocrite, too, taking advantage of a blind woman." See, but I wanted to see whether she really believed it. Do you believe that's the truth? She said, "Yes, sir." And I I began to feel it and she said, "Yes, sir. I believe it." And I said, "Why don't you believe that God would do something like that? As far advanced as med medical science is h science can't do nothing for you, why would you believe something supernatural would? Yeah. &gt;&gt; H. She said, "Sir," and said, "When I was a little girl, I got cataracts on my eyes. The doctor told me when they got ripe, I don't know what that means, but when it got ripe, they'd take them off." And said, "Now they're ripe." And said, "They say if they take them out, they pull the optical nerves right out of my eyes." Said, "I can't see." And the only hope I got is to get in there. And this is the man last the this is the man's last night here. And they tell me I can't even get near the building. I've lost my daddy. I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; I don't know what to do. I've had those moments. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Do you believe if you'd get in there, you'd be healed?" She said, "Well, I heard of a man on the radio this morning from up at Connect Ket, Missouri. Had been blind for 10 years and he received his sight." So said, "Well, couldn't I be healed too?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can't you overcome, too? &gt;&gt; Can't you be healed, too? &gt;&gt; Can't God take care of your problems, too? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many's had something miraculous happen? Raise your hands. Get them up there. &gt;&gt; Look around. Whatever your situation is, if he did it for brother Harry, can he do it for me? &gt;&gt; If he did it for brother Rob, &gt;&gt; can he do it for me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to stop looking within ourselves and say, "I'm a son of do son or daughter of God." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I have just as much right to your healing, your deliverance, your overcoming as anybody else here. &gt;&gt; Sure. His word is not a respector of persons. &gt;&gt; I said, "Do you believe that?" She said, "Sir, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you'll just get me into where that man's at, I'll be able to find my daddy after that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; I'll be able to find my daddy. She had a tiepole. She had something to anchor her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, we know it wasn't brother Brandham. It was Jesus Christ. But he was a channel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; She held on to that. &gt;&gt; All these problems are going to go away if I can just get to that place. &gt;&gt; I'll find my own daddy. I'll get my own way home. I felt my heart drop right away from from me. I thought, poor old blind thing. I said, "Look, lady, do you mean that?" Still tempting her. &gt;&gt; Still tempting her. Do you mean that? &gt;&gt; She said, "Yes." Oh, I said, "Maybe I'm the one you're supposed to see." And she grabbed me up like that. She said, "Is you the healer?" And I said, "No, ma'am." I said, "I'm Brother Brandham. Jesus is the healer." &gt;&gt; And she grabbed me. She said, "Oh, Brother Brandham, have mercy on me. Have mercy on me." And I thought of poor old blind Fanny Crosby. &gt;&gt; Fanny Crosby never did get her sight. Never did. &gt;&gt; She never did. And I'm I'm going for memory, but if memory serves her, right, Brother Random said that if she would have got her healing, she wouldn't have been able to write those songs that she wrote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, God's a healer. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But as a son and daughter of God, he heals within the bounds of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you're casting a death. No, she never did quit praying for healing. Brother Brand doesn't say that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But she kept believing. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's called us to do, to keep believing, to keep having that faith that he's called us to as sons and daughters of God. He's called us to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't call us just to believe because of the results because we don't like the results sometimes. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean he's not God. And it doesn't mean that his will hasn't been done. &gt;&gt; General orders by his stripes I am healed. &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer. &gt;&gt; You are more than a conqueror. All these things and we hold on to those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we'll know when God says that's my will and then we won't have to ask anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But until that's settled in your heart, just like that faith is settled in your heart, you keep believing for his promises. Right. &gt;&gt; And I looked and I thought her only hope, Christ. I said, "Now, I don't want to be recognized in the crowd. Lady, you bow your head and we'll have a word of prayer." Said, "First, I want to hold your hand while I'm praying." I couldn't get her hand off my coat. She wasn't going to let me go. &gt;&gt; Pass me not, oh gentle savior. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will wrestle with you. &gt;&gt; I will hold on to you, God. &gt;&gt; I'm not letting go. &gt;&gt; I'm not stopping. I'm going to keep believing. You're my deliverer. You're my my overcomer. You're my healer. And I said, "Now let me have your hand." She said, "Don't pass me." And I took hold of her hand and pulled it off and held her hand. And while I was praying, now you can mark this is fanaticism if you want to. That would be between you and God. See, I could only tell the truth. Something happened. I knew the woman was healed. I was waiting for the shrinkage of that cataract. I said, "Now keep your lids closed over your eyes." I said, "Now you raise your head just about to where you think my voice is coming and I'll tell you what to do." She said, "Yes, sir." Said something cold went over me. I said, "Just raise your head." And I said, "Now open your eyes, for thus saith the Holy Spirit, you've received your sight." And she opened her eyes and she said, "Is that light?" And I said, "Yes." She said, "Is them black dots there? Is that people?" Her eyesight was not clear. &gt;&gt; It wasn't It wasn't all the way there. &gt;&gt; This is another point where God is tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many times did brother Random say, "Go confessing. Go believing." &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your symptoms are, you keep confessing your healing. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your your your your uh besetting sin is. You keep confessing your healing. &gt;&gt; You keep going. Keep marching towards that thing. &gt;&gt; Don't settle for it. Well, I can see white lights and shapes of people. That's good enough. Oh Lord, she says, "Oh Lord, I who was once blind can now see." She let out a big scream. And then they've been some people standing there and watching and here they come. My you talk about and I happened to look now he's trying to get out of a meeting and he's supposed to meet these brothers that are supposed to escort him to a car and he snuck out a back door but there was this mass of people he couldn't get through and this is when he ran into this just in case you uh and I happened to look and there was an old man standing there with a cane an old club in his hand his leg was twisted sideways said brother Brandham I know you. He said, "I've been standing in the rain for eight or 10 days here." Eight or 10 days in the rain. Why? &gt;&gt; God was tempting him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Said, "You wouldn't pass me, would you, Brother Brandon?" Said, "I got a bunch of kitties at home." Said, "They need me." said, "A woman going to run over me and I'm twisted my leg like this." I said, "Do you believe?" He said, "With all my heart and I said of in the name of the Lord Jesus, give me your cane." &gt;&gt; It didn't say his foot straightened out first. &gt;&gt; It didn't say he was healed and jumped around and handed him the cane. &gt;&gt; He said, "Give me that cane." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know. Aa Allen used to have an anvil on the platform, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And what would he do? I need healing for my eyes. Give me your glasses. &gt;&gt; He set them on the anvil and crush them with a hammer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't no turning back. Ain't no turning back. And the Lord who is my sovereign judge when that man in the act of faith handed his cane his leg come straight and he jumped into the air and screamed to the top of his voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; What are you in need of? How has God been tempting you? Where are you at in your walk? Are you questioning? Do you not understand? You wouldn't be the only one. This message, have you read some stuff online and it's in your mind? Sometimes God opens portals to hell to get your attention. What are you made of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where are you at in your experience? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wants all your hope hope destroyed. We don't need hope in the last days. It starts with hope. A lot of times, a lot of things start with hope, don't get me wrong, but hope is shaky. &gt;&gt; We have to be established in faith, brothers. Come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's your walk? It's time to self-examine. Say, "Brother John, I I believe I believe. But man, I'm really struggling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've been in a circumstance for so long. I've dealt with a besetting sin for so long. &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this struggle or that struggle. Does your circumstance change who God is? &gt;&gt; No. Does your problem change who God is? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. Be sure that your call is sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're going through, brothers and sisters. Stand with me if you would. I don't care how bad that you feel tempted. Sometimes that tempted temptation is of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's wanting to make sure that you know that you know. And the and the closer we get to home, the more important it is that we're sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So things are going to get tighter. Things are going to get harder. We're not going to have this this instant success, if I could put it that way. This get-richqu scheme that that the devil's trying to feed people. He's trying to to to smooth over this this well, that's good enough. Nobody else is living like that. Nobody's still, you know, even the message churches, they're they're bickering. Some of them are bickering back and forth and we've got those that that believe in emotion and and those that believe that you have emotion. You're Let me tell you something. I've never seen nor has brother Harry or anybody else. Nobody's ever seen emotion heal the sick. Nope. So we shouldn't get emotional. No. I said emotion doesn't heal the sick. Emotion doesn't deliver. But I tell you what, if you get delivered, you're gonna have some emotion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you get if you get healed, you're going to have some emotion. &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. That's where the balance is, brothers and sisters. We're not focusing on one side or the other. We know that they're both united in the fact that he's my deliverer, and I'm happy about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I and and I'm going to express that happiness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Oh, heavenly father, Lord, I believe with all my heart, Lord Jesus, that you have spoke, Lord, if to no one else but myself, Lord. It seems so hard in lessa these days, Lord, this this old flesh. And it seems ironic, Lord, that we've got all these temptations around us. And we find that you yourself tempt us to see where our faith is, to see if we really believe. And Lord, you're not doing it out of meanness. You're conditioning us, Lord. And we can go home, Lord. I know there's people here, Lord, that are facing impossible situations. Lord, maybe it's their in their own life. Maybe it's with a sickness. Maybe it's with overcoming. Maybe Lord Jesus, they see in your word where you said raise them up in the way that they should go and when they get older they will not depart. And Lord, they're they seem so far away from where you called them in the way that we raised them. But Lord, is there anything too hard for God? Is there any circumstance, Lord Jesus, that we as a bride won't be able to overcome? &gt;&gt; No, Lord. I know with all my heart there's nothing too hard for you. Lord, help us to look to your word, to your promise, and embrace, Lord Jesus, what you've called us to. And Lord, even when our our mind is one set one way and you go the opposite direction, Lord, I know as the bride of Christ, we we say, "All right." But sometimes it hurts even still. Sometimes we can't understand it. Lord, just give us grace. Lord, we love you. I pray, Father, that you would just help each and every one in this building tonight, Lord, to look to the author and the finisher of our faith to go ahead and finish our faith. whatever may come Lord we love you and we thank you for it Lordes &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. Amen. Can we sing uh pass me nod? You want to sing with me just a minute? If you have a need tonight, he's here. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "Brother John, maybe he's tempting me." Maybe he is. But at any moment he could deliver you. &gt;&gt; Maybe tonight's your night. &gt;&gt; Oh, pass me now, oh gentle Savior. Hear my heart cry. Let's worship him now. Why others out are calling?

God always knows what's going on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He always does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not in dark. He's not surprised. &gt;&gt; He knows what you have need of. &gt;&gt; He's not shocked of your shortcomings and your faults and your failures. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he's also not shocked &gt;&gt; of your faith &gt;&gt; and your belief in him. &gt;&gt; He knows who you are better than you know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know, I got lots of pictures of my kids all over the house. Not so many of me. There's a reason for that. Was, you know, when I forget what they were like when they were little, I can go find a picture And sometimes we forget who we are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we're saying, God, I'm not I'm not anything like you called me to be. &gt;&gt; I fall so short. &gt;&gt; What's the first thing he does? Brother Harry pulls out that picture of you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; This is it. This is you. &gt;&gt; You see it in my word. This is you. &gt;&gt; He ain't never going to forget. &gt;&gt; And that's what he sees. He always sweet sees that. Cuz when they get bigger, they ain't always so sweet. &gt;&gt; I wasn't either. And neither were you. &gt;&gt; But every now and then, it's good to remember what they were before the foundation of the world. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he just pulls out that picture. I open up that word and I say, "Oh, mama, that's me. &gt;&gt; Mama, that's me." &gt;&gt; I see myself in that word. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have any faults? No. That's when I need it the most is when I'm falling short and I'm I'm failing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I need to look into his promise and see that he sees me the same way he and and he's wanting me to see who I am. Amen. God bless you, brother Justin. I appreciate you all. God bless. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many you can say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord this evening. Amen. We'll sing this song as we get ready to go. Let's just stay stay in worship just for a couple more minutes. I know it's late and kids getting back to school, but let's just sing. He didn't throw the clay away. You know, Brother John's talking about he every time you stumble and fall and that's the only song I could really think of. So, let's sing a song. He is the potter. I am the clay molded in his image is how he wants me to stay. But I stumble and I fall and my vessel breaks. He just picks up all the broken pieces. He doesn't throw the clay away. And over and over he molds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the way I am today. And it's all because Jesus did all the clay. empty and broken. I came back to him, a vessel unworthy. I've been so scared by sin. But he did not despair. He started over again. Oh, and I'm so eating the road clay. [Music] Now, he knows me and makes me into his lik of honor I am today. And it's all because Jesus in the clear way. Now over and over. He holds me and makes me into his likess. He fashions the clay of the soul of honor I am today. And it's all because Jesus didn't throw the clay away. [Music] He is the potter and I am the clay. Molded in his image is how he wants me to stay. But when I stumble and I fall and my vessel breaks, he just picks up all the broken pieces. He doesn't throw the clay away. [Music] Now over and over. He holds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the That's all of our earth. That's what I am today. And is all because Jesus didn't throw a clear away. [Music] Now over and over. [Applause] [Music]
