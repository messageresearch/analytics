[41:19] turn with me to the Book of Joshua
[41:22] chapter 6.
[41:24] now let me just say here tonight that I
[41:27] have preached
[41:28] um from Joshua chapter 6 for many many
[41:31] years
[41:33] and I spoke about here not long ago
[41:36] but
[41:37] I'm going to preach about it tonight in
[41:40] a way
[41:41] but I have never spoken before as a
[41:44] matter of fact never even thought of it
[41:45] before
[41:46] until this evening
[41:48] I thought that I was ready for tonight
[41:50] had a nice little sermon all put
[41:52] together
[41:53] a lot of really good scriptures a lot of
[41:55] good quotes and I just thought it was a
[41:57] really good sermon
[42:00] that the Lord pushed paused on that one
[42:04] and wanted me to bring this one to you
[42:05] tonight
[42:07] so what I want to speak to you tonight
[42:09] is on this thought going
[42:14] in circles
[42:19] going
[42:20] in circles
[42:23] Joshua 6 1.
[42:25] now Jericho was straightly shut up
[42:27] because of the children of Israel none
[42:30] went out
[42:31] and none came in
[42:33] October the sister when the children of
[42:35] God are Marching hell is upset
[42:40] and the Lord said unto Joshua's see I
[42:43] have given into thine hand Jericho and
[42:45] the King thereof
[42:47] and the Mighty Men of Valor now for
[42:49] those of you who know history very well
[42:51] you know that Jericho is the oldest
[42:54] longest inhabited City on the entire
[42:58] Earth
[43:00] the Earth
[43:02] no older city than Jericho as far as
[43:05] inhabitants being there
[43:07] and ye shall Compass the city all ye Men
[43:11] of War
[43:13] and go round listen carefully round
[43:18] about
[43:20] the city wants you'll go round
[43:24] about in other words going in circles
[43:30] you'll go round about the city once thus
[43:34] shalt thou do
[43:36] six days
[43:39] so they're going in circles
[43:41] for a total of seven days
[43:45] six days absolutely nothing
[43:49] will happen
[43:52] and seven priests shall bear before the
[43:54] ark seven trumpets of Ram's horns and
[43:56] the seventh day you shall Compass the
[43:59] city seven times
[44:02] so on the seventh day can pass it seven
[44:04] times
[44:06] and the priest shall blow with the
[44:10] trumpets and it shall come to pass that
[44:12] when they shall make a long blast with a
[44:14] Ram's Horn and when you hear the sound
[44:17] of the trumpet all the people shall
[44:19] Shout with a great shout now notice and
[44:24] the wall of the city
[44:26] shall fall down flat
[44:29] and the people shall Ascend up every man
[44:33] straight before him
[44:36] I may like to be remembered tonight as
[44:38] we pray have a need to request on your
[44:40] heart those of you that are invisible to
[44:42] us tonight I'm sure you do as well can
[44:44] we just bow our heads and approach the
[44:46] Lord
[44:48] Heavenly Father we love you so much
[44:50] tonight we're thankful Lord Jesus for
[44:53] all that you mean to us
[44:55] Lord how we appreciated that song you
[44:58] know our name not only our human name
[45:00] but our divine name
[45:03] Lord God we're so thankful that you know
[45:05] all about us
[45:07] you know about all the Journey of life
[45:09] that we'll have you know the
[45:11] difficulties and the happy times that
[45:13] we'll have you know all of that
[45:16] Lord those things will take us by
[45:18] surprise down here yet nothing has ever
[45:21] taken you off guard or by surprise so it
[45:26] gives us confidence in you and in your
[45:27] word
[45:28] so as we Endeavor to look into your word
[45:31] tonight and as I Endeavor to bring what
[45:34] you placed on my heart this evening I
[45:36] pray that you would help me Lord may you
[45:39] capture our Attention our thoughts speak
[45:42] to us as only you can do father we
[45:45] commit the speaker the hearers and the
[45:47] word into your great hands lord it's in
[45:50] the name of the Lord Jesus that we ask
[45:52] it amen God bless you you may be seated
[45:59] so according to
[46:01] archaeological digs
[46:03] into
[46:05] the Carbon 14 dating
[46:08] as far as what they've been able to take
[46:10] it back to about the time of Joshua
[46:15] Jericho was many different sizes and
[46:19] different time frames smaller sometimes
[46:22] larger sometimes but by the Carbon 14
[46:25] dating that they've been able to come up
[46:28] with so far the circumference of the
[46:33] city of Jericho and the time that Joshua
[46:37] and the children of Israel would have
[46:39] been marching around it was about a half
[46:43] a mile
[46:44] so the circumference as you had started
[46:47] out from wherever point that they
[46:49] started on day one and they March around
[46:52] and they make a complete Loop all the
[46:55] way around the city on day one and they
[46:59] would come back to where they started
[47:01] and they would have covered about a half
[47:04] a mile so that would have been a total
[47:07] of marching about six and a half miles
[47:12] in seven days now that wouldn't really
[47:16] be that much for a runner that wouldn't
[47:19] be that much some of you can probably
[47:21] walk I know there's people here that can
[47:24] ride their bicycle a whole lot farther
[47:26] than that in a day but if you were sick
[47:30] or if you were weary or if you were old
[47:35] now can you imagine trying to walk now
[47:38] remember when they come out of the land
[47:40] of Egypt the Bible says there was not
[47:42] one feeble among them but it doesn't say
[47:45] this about this Trek in Jericho so that
[47:49] was something God gave them for that
[47:51] little time frame of coming out of the
[47:53] land of Egypt but it only lasted for a
[47:55] while for the rest of the time that got
[47:58] sick they got tired they got weary they
[48:01] got feeble they got old and all of that
[48:04] so for you to be able to walk a half a
[48:08] mile on day one a half a mile on day two
[48:12] and so on until day seven and then on
[48:17] day seven you're gonna make seven trips
[48:20] around so a half a mile half a mile half
[48:25] a mile half a mile half a mile well what
[48:28] if you're sick well what if you're just
[48:31] down that day and you just don't feel
[48:33] like walking well you know a lot of the
[48:37] victory would have depended upon the
[48:40] faithfulness of the people now I'm sure
[48:43] that we're probably all more alike than
[48:47] we are different I would imagine that
[48:50] for almost everybody here under the
[48:52] sound of my voice that you go through
[48:55] times in your life to where that you
[48:58] feel like you're just in circles you
[49:01] know I've never really
[49:03] geographical diagrams and drawings a
[49:07] circle has never been one of my favorite
[49:09] I like a trapezoid I like a pyramid I
[49:13] even like a square bigger better than a
[49:16] circle a rectangle they're just I've got
[49:18] favorite you know as we all have I just
[49:21] have favorite of those measures but a
[49:24] circle it just seemed like to me that
[49:27] you're not going anywhere it's just same
[49:30] light that you're going around and
[49:32] around and you're seeing the same things
[49:35] and the same people and you're feeling
[49:38] the same way and it's like the sun comes
[49:42] up the same way it sets the same way you
[49:44] know I believe sometimes the reason that
[49:46] people get weary even with going to
[49:50] church it's because they're in a church
[49:53] Circle instead of a church pyramid and
[49:58] they go to church and to them church is
[50:01] the same ever service so it don't mean
[50:04] no difference who's preaching who's
[50:06] singing a special song what's going on
[50:08] to them it's just church as usual well
[50:12] you know I find that pretty sad myself
[50:14] and pretty disappointing because it
[50:18] depends on what you and I will expect
[50:21] Church to be and what we put into it
[50:24] will be a lot of what we get out of it
[50:26] so a lot of people they just get to that
[50:29] in their walk with was God a lot of
[50:31] people in their marriage they're in a
[50:34] marriage Circle so they just go around
[50:37] and around and around and around and the
[50:40] husband gets tired of the wife now of
[50:42] course from this point on until I get
[50:45] done with this nobody says anything
[50:46] everybody's such earned Smiles except
[50:49] for the single people and they all say
[50:51] Amen because they ain't married yet but
[50:53] all the married people if they're not
[50:54] really careful they will get in a circle
[50:57] and you get up and you do the same old
[51:00] things every day and you say the same
[51:02] old things and she's a response to the
[51:05] same things that you've said for the
[51:07] last 45 years and she responds with the
[51:10] same old things and then you respond in
[51:12] the same old way and you go to Walmart
[51:14] at the same time and you get the same
[51:16] old groceries and the you know the same
[51:19] old same old same old and people get so
[51:21] bored with the drudgery of marriage and
[51:25] the devil knows that that's why he wants
[51:27] to cause them to do something outside of
[51:29] marriage to bring a little bit of
[51:31] excitement to the marriage well it's the
[51:33] same way with church it's the same way
[51:35] with our walk with God I wonder how many
[51:38] of us tonight if we would be able to
[51:41] look at the geographical measure that
[51:44] would perfectly describe our life would
[51:47] it be a trapezoid would it be a pyramid
[51:50] would it be a rectangular would it be a
[51:52] square would it be a very complex design
[51:55] or would it be just a circle that we
[51:58] went around and around and the devil
[52:01] knows what we're going to do he knows
[52:03] the prayer we're going to pray he knows
[52:05] the way we're going to clap our hands
[52:06] three times and then stop and then one
[52:08] and then we stop again and three times
[52:10] and then amen three amens and 14 all
[52:14] mice and then three oh my oh my and he
[52:17] got us right down I'll tell you what
[52:19] every now and then we need to just kind
[52:21] of change that to mess with the devil
[52:23] it's nothing else just so he don't know
[52:26] what we're doing
[52:29] but uh what I what I looked at this
[52:31] evening is the Lord started dealing with
[52:34] my heart about this was that there were
[52:37] three now listen to words that the Lord
[52:40] spoke to me that they were moving on and
[52:44] they're going to uh day one and day two
[52:47] and day three and day four and day five
[52:50] and day six and this is what the Lord
[52:53] told me this afternoon that these were
[52:58] non-mirical days
[53:01] [Music]
[53:02] non-mirical
[53:04] non-miraculous day so they had six
[53:09] non-miraculous days Days by which
[53:12] they're going to do the same thing over
[53:15] and over again so the priests are going
[53:19] to do a certain thing and they're going
[53:21] to walk a certain way and the people are
[53:24] not allowed to say anything at all day
[53:26] one day two through day six so it was
[53:30] going to become what seemingly would be
[53:33] very methodical and it could seem as if
[53:37] so nothing was happening and I wonder if
[53:41] in our life sometimes that we don't get
[53:44] into these
[53:46] non-miracular Circles of everyday walk
[53:50] with God now maybe you're different from
[53:53] me but I have a lot more
[53:56] non-miraculous days than I do miraculous
[54:00] days now I I love the miraculous days
[54:03] when they come don't you I love it when
[54:06] they're there but I have to be honest
[54:08] with you I have more days that are
[54:11] non-miraculous than I do that are
[54:14] miraculous but I wonder are those days
[54:17] in vain or are those days not necessary
[54:21] and essential to lead up to the seventh
[54:26] miraculous days now if we did not have
[54:30] the six days of our life would they not
[54:34] lead consecutively up to the seventh
[54:37] miraculous day but if they were not
[54:41] there I wonder would the seventh day be
[54:45] as miraculous without the prior six now
[54:50] you see it's in these non-miraculous
[54:53] days whenever we are simply obeying the
[54:57] word we're doing what God says we go to
[55:00] church we read our Bible we pray we live
[55:03] right we do good deeds we do good works
[55:05] praise the lord we do all the things
[55:08] that we're supposed to do and yet by the
[55:10] end of the day when it comes well you
[55:13] was asking God for healing or a miracle
[55:15] didn't happen day two you go to church
[55:18] or you read your Bible you go to work
[55:19] you pray you do all those things the end
[55:22] of the day no Miracle again day three
[55:24] day four day five day six but yet you
[55:28] did ever everything the same way you
[55:31] love the Lord you lived right that day
[55:33] you obeyed his word and you praise him
[55:36] for what you believe he's going to do
[55:38] but he didn't do it yet but you kept on
[55:41] praising him anyhow anybody going to
[55:44] hear me tonight now I wonder if we don't
[55:47] look sometimes at the seventh day of the
[55:51] miraculous and make it the greatest day
[55:54] of all and we live if we're not careful
[55:57] we would like every day of the week to
[56:01] be number seven so Monday would be seven
[56:03] Tuesday would be seven Wednesday would
[56:05] be seven Thursday would be seven Friday
[56:07] you understand Saturday and Sunday and
[56:10] then the beginning of the next week it
[56:12] would all be
[56:13] 777. well what you're wanting is the
[56:16] Millennium right now but I hate to tell
[56:19] you it ain't here yet
[56:21] but in this cycle of life that we're in
[56:24] we more than likely will have more
[56:28] non-miraculous days than we will the
[56:32] miraculous now God does this of course
[56:34] for a reason to check our faithfulness
[56:37] and to make sure that we won't get weary
[56:40] and I've got to be honest with you
[56:41] sometimes I do anybody else in your get
[56:44] weary you know it's amazing that the
[56:47] miraculous days generally don't make me
[56:50] weary now if I could just figure out how
[56:52] that works and I just have such a good
[56:55] day on miraculous days and when
[56:58] everything is going good when I do have
[57:00] one of them days let me see how many
[57:02] years has it been since I've had one of
[57:03] them days that ever seen during that day
[57:05] was good let me think about it and I'll
[57:06] get back with you on that one but you
[57:08] know it's those types of days when we
[57:10] can become so weary and worn anybody
[57:13] know what I'm saying now I want you to
[57:15] notice uh continuing here in Joshua 6
[57:18] 12. that the word says and Joshua rose
[57:21] up early in the morning and the priest
[57:24] took up the Ark of the Lord and seven
[57:27] priests bearing seven trumpets of Ram's
[57:29] horns before the Ark of the Lord went on
[57:32] continually and blew with the trumpets
[57:34] and the armed men went before them but
[57:38] the reward came out to the Ark of the
[57:41] Lord the priests going on and blowing
[57:44] with the trumpets and the second day
[57:46] they compassed the city which meant they
[57:49] circled it again they compassed the city
[57:52] once and returned into the camp so they
[57:56] did six days so they've got six circles
[58:02] six
[58:03] non-miraculous Circle days
[58:07] nobody shouted nobody run nobody jumped
[58:11] you couldn't even get him to say Amen
[58:14] God told him not to say one word
[58:16] so it was a very
[58:19] non-eventful six days they're not
[58:23] singing they're not worshiping and
[58:25] that's one of the hardest thing in the
[58:27] world for a human being to keep their
[58:28] mouth shut can you imagine that was a
[58:30] miracle within itself so they couldn't
[58:32] complain they couldn't praise they
[58:33] couldn't pray they just couldn't do
[58:35] anything now I would imagine when they
[58:37] got back to their tent they'd done all
[58:40] of the above and more included now can
[58:43] you you just and your mind as I imagine
[58:45] in mind but the nation that they would
[58:48] walk out there and they would do this it
[58:50] would take them however long to walk a
[58:52] half a mile now that was not all hassle
[58:54] each of course and they would have the
[58:56] old and the feeble and the infern they
[58:58] did not have ambulances to be able to
[59:00] tote them around they did not have
[59:02] wheelchairs as far as we know so maybe
[59:05] the pace was quite slow it was not as
[59:09] fast as some of the others would have
[59:10] liked for it to been so it would have
[59:12] probably taken a good while because it
[59:15] had around two and a half million people
[59:17] so they're going pretty slow so it would
[59:20] have been you know quite a while so from
[59:23] the time they start until they get done
[59:25] they imagine some and they're speed
[59:27] Walkers and they're called Plumb back at
[59:30] the rear end the re-reward now that's
[59:33] the way some of us are we want God to do
[59:36] it now because we are Leo to sins we've
[59:40] got microwave popcorn we've got instant
[59:43] mashed potatoes we've got instant coffee
[59:46] and we want an instant God to go along
[59:48] with our instant coffee
[59:50] but God has not changed even though your
[59:54] meals have God don't have a pop it in
[59:56] and pop it out 30-second warm up and you
[59:59] get it no God still goes the
[1:00:01] old-fashioned God way and that is he
[1:00:04] will try us like never before
[1:00:08] so here they go day one absolutely
[1:00:11] uneventful at all no Miracles no
[1:00:15] healings no signs no wonders so they all
[1:00:18] do they finally get to and I hate me and
[1:00:19] people around this half a mile track and
[1:00:22] they all go back to the camp can you
[1:00:23] imagine they go to getting together I
[1:00:25] said what in the world was that all even
[1:00:26] for I don't even understand what did we
[1:00:29] just do did you feel anything brother
[1:00:32] Paul that you feeling the same brother
[1:00:34] Rob what about the rest you but Fred
[1:00:36] well did you feel anything when we ran
[1:00:39] around brother John did you feel any
[1:00:40] tingles or anything up and down your
[1:00:43] spine or did you hear anything was there
[1:00:46] anything did I miss it anybody see a
[1:00:48] vision anybody catch a dream anybody
[1:00:51] feeling anything Supernatural that
[1:00:54] happened in this and no no I didn't see
[1:00:56] a thing I didn't feel a saying I didn't
[1:00:59] hear a saying the pillar of fire wasn't
[1:01:01] there as far as I know the cloud wasn't
[1:01:03] there uh I'm not even sure why we was
[1:01:06] doing this well maybe tomorrow will be
[1:01:08] better so they come back to church on
[1:01:11] Sunday morning and then they're there
[1:01:13] now they kind of start the same way and
[1:01:15] the song literally gets up well that
[1:01:16] means happy to be here today well they
[1:01:18] still remember Wednesday night
[1:01:21] so they're kind of setting a lot in the
[1:01:23] form of a circle that's their mentality
[1:01:25] now God wants them to be a trapezoid on
[1:01:28] that service but they've still got this
[1:01:30] circle mentality and you're not moving
[1:01:32] them out of it I don't care what you do
[1:01:34] well I feel sorry for the song leader
[1:01:36] sometimes you come in you're all loaded
[1:01:38] down with everything in the world on you
[1:01:40] and they're trying to get you all pumped
[1:01:42] up and they're trying to get you up to
[1:01:43] receive the word y'all to appreciate our
[1:01:45] brothers I said John appreciate them you
[1:01:49] ought to try to cooperate with them and
[1:01:50] help them they're trying to do it for
[1:01:52] you
[1:01:53] so day two goes by nothing another
[1:01:56] non-eventful day not one Miracle we have
[1:01:59] no record whatsoever that anything
[1:02:01] happened on day one up through day six
[1:02:04] so it must have been be very obvious to
[1:02:07] the People by now by the time they reach
[1:02:10] day three four five Oh you mean we've
[1:02:12] got to do it again today huh we got to
[1:02:15] go back out so I was at church Sunday I
[1:02:17] didn't feel one thing you made I gotta
[1:02:20] go back again tonight well what if I
[1:02:22] don't feel anything tonight well if you
[1:02:24] don't maybe come back Sunday and it'll
[1:02:26] be your day but what if I don't I'd keep
[1:02:28] coming back until it is your day because
[1:02:31] your seventh day will arise
[1:02:36] now it may be longer than seven
[1:02:38] sometimes I've found seven days turned
[1:02:40] into seven weeks and I'm just hoping it
[1:02:42] don't turn into seven years you know but
[1:02:45] God always knows exactly what he's doing
[1:02:48] does he not so when you calculate this
[1:02:51] set now it would have been a total of 13
[1:02:55] times that they March around the city so
[1:02:59] they want to run around Monday Tuesday
[1:03:00] Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday
[1:03:03] that would have been six times now on on
[1:03:06] the seventh day of course they go around
[1:03:08] seven so seven and six as you know is
[1:03:10] 13. so they go around this thing 13
[1:03:13] times an accumulation of six and a half
[1:03:16] miles that they walk around this city
[1:03:20] and all six days prior to this have been
[1:03:24] non-miraculous my goodness I love that
[1:03:26] word I was just overwhelmed today when
[1:03:28] the Lord spoke that to me I'm not sure
[1:03:30] that Webster even knows about that word
[1:03:32] but it don't matter to me apparently
[1:03:34] it's it ranks in heaven so all matters
[1:03:36] to me anyway so six days were
[1:03:39] non-miraculous they were non-eventful
[1:03:42] nobody felt and he's saying nobody heard
[1:03:45] the wind nobody saw the pillar of fire
[1:03:47] and maybe some of them got up on the
[1:03:50] seventh day so you mean we got to go
[1:03:52] through this whole deal again today oh
[1:03:55] no you're missing and we've got to go
[1:03:57] around it seven times today seven times
[1:04:00] now remember the sick the feeble they
[1:04:03] had not been healed on day one they had
[1:04:06] not been healed there's no record one
[1:04:08] miracle that all happened on those days
[1:04:11] what are they doing they're making
[1:04:13] circles around Jericho so around and
[1:04:17] around and around they go you know Satan
[1:04:20] loves himself to you circles now listen
[1:04:23] to me God will use them at times in
[1:04:27] order to prove a point but Satan loves
[1:04:30] to get people in circles almost like a
[1:04:33] merry-go-round so where people get on
[1:04:35] this same and it's like they cannot get
[1:04:38] off now I as I said circles has never
[1:04:41] been one of my favorite things because
[1:04:43] my balance is really weird in my head
[1:04:45] always has been so as a child I could
[1:04:48] never go around and around right any
[1:04:50] type of ride my goodness a round or two
[1:04:53] and I'm laying on the floor sick as a
[1:04:54] dog so I never really enjoyed circles
[1:04:57] but you can imagine whenever we get on
[1:05:00] the Merry-Go-Round of Satan's scheme of
[1:05:03] life and he will get you on this thing
[1:05:06] maybe it's a besetting sin or maybe it's
[1:05:08] something going on in your life and
[1:05:10] you're in this unending cycle of this
[1:05:13] circle and you do wrong and you repent
[1:05:15] and you do wrong and you repent and you
[1:05:18] do wrong and you repent and you say to
[1:05:20] God I'll never do it again and I'm sorry
[1:05:21] Lord and I'll never do it again but
[1:05:23] you'll wind up doing it again and then
[1:05:25] you repent and then you do it again and
[1:05:27] then you repeat and then you do it again
[1:05:29] you're not on a trapezoid you're not on
[1:05:32] a pyramid you're on a circle
[1:05:35] oh Hallelujah but if it was the Lord God
[1:05:39] who gave me this today this evening I
[1:05:42] believe tonight we can break some of
[1:05:45] these circles
[1:05:47] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:50] oh my soak you they go around with all
[1:05:54] the accumulation now of the six and
[1:05:57] seven days so they track this half a
[1:06:00] mile and they'd walk all the
[1:06:02] accumulation of it it would have been a
[1:06:04] total of six miles in 13 times so a
[1:06:09] total of 13 times or six and a half
[1:06:11] miles but on the 12th time it would have
[1:06:14] been a total of six miles that they
[1:06:17] walked and absolutely nothing happened
[1:06:20] so they went around and around and
[1:06:22] around and around for 12 times and saw
[1:06:25] nothing now you don't have to raise your
[1:06:27] hand tonight but if you came to church
[1:06:30] here 12 Services found nothing got
[1:06:34] nothing out of service
[1:06:36] would you come back 13.
[1:06:43] oh some of you ain't gonna say all right
[1:06:45] you got to think it through huh so 12
[1:06:48] laps they make no change whatsoever
[1:06:53] now I find this so strange but afraid
[1:06:55] because 13
[1:06:57] it's not one of God's Divine numbers
[1:07:01] actually 13 shows up in the Book of
[1:07:03] Revelation of course that numbers our
[1:07:05] our nation and 13 is not a it's not a
[1:07:08] good number but yet 13 it was on the
[1:07:11] 13th round that actually the miraculous
[1:07:15] started taking place now why not on 12
[1:07:19] which is of course a patriarchal number
[1:07:22] which is the 12 tribes of Israel why
[1:07:26] would God choose round 13 in order to
[1:07:31] bring his Deliverance well I don't have
[1:07:33] the answer for you but I'll give you
[1:07:35] something think of that anyway so you
[1:07:37] can imagine now 12 times they go around
[1:07:40] nothing happens non-miraculous trips
[1:07:43] another and another and another
[1:07:45] absolutely nothing takes place what is
[1:07:48] God doing God is doing to them what God
[1:07:52] does to us sometimes and that is God is
[1:07:56] checking us out on trip one trip two
[1:08:00] trip three trip four on up to trip 12
[1:08:02] and c will we become so weary in the
[1:08:08] non-eventful trips that we say I'm not
[1:08:12] going back anymore
[1:08:14] but you see even though it might not
[1:08:17] have seemed like that God was doing
[1:08:19] anything God was taking notice of their
[1:08:23] behavior in these non-miraculous days
[1:08:27] they were still doing what God Said do
[1:08:30] you see we want to get God's attention
[1:08:33] don't we don't we want God's attention
[1:08:35] tonight well I'll tell you how we get it
[1:08:37] it's not by calming our hair on a
[1:08:39] certain side of her head or we all
[1:08:41] disciple all our white on Sunday no
[1:08:43] that's not how we get God's attention we
[1:08:45] get God's attention by keeping his word
[1:08:49] now that's what God loves is when people
[1:08:52] will keep his word so God is listening
[1:08:55] to what they're saying God Is Watching
[1:08:58] what they're doing and God is seeing
[1:09:00] that they are obedient they feel nothing
[1:09:02] they see nothing they can tell no
[1:09:05] difference at all now remember 12 trips
[1:09:09] around this a total of six miles all
[1:09:12] tall and they have seen not one thing
[1:09:15] not one little tiny gravel fell off from
[1:09:19] the top not one little bitty rock fell
[1:09:22] out from the middle of the wall they saw
[1:09:24] nothing they heard nothing they could
[1:09:27] tell no change whatsoever but yet they
[1:09:30] were doing what God had told them to do
[1:09:33] under their leader Joshua I wish
[1:09:36] somebody would say Amen you see obeying
[1:09:39] the word in non-miraculous days
[1:09:43] is what makes the word made manifest on
[1:09:47] the miraculous day oh glory to God oh
[1:09:51] glory to God thank you Lord Jesus I'll
[1:09:53] tell you I just about had me a spell to
[1:09:55] sing them when he spoke that to me
[1:09:57] obeying the word in non-miraculous days
[1:10:01] is what makes the miraculous day well
[1:10:04] this day five day seven day ten day
[1:10:06] Thirty whatever it is it's you being
[1:10:09] faithful to the word of God I mean it
[1:10:11] wants to be faithful notice this
[1:10:13] scripture I love this in Galatians
[1:10:15] chapter 6 verse 9. I know that you know
[1:10:18] it but if you don't know it this ought
[1:10:19] to be one of your favorites when you get
[1:10:21] down and weary and let us not be weary
[1:10:25] in well-doing weary and well doing look
[1:10:30] at the meaning of this word to be
[1:10:33] utterly spiritless
[1:10:35] to be utterly spiritless how many knows
[1:10:39] what it feels like to be down in your
[1:10:41] spirit
[1:10:41] I'll tell you one day if you don't oh my
[1:10:44] goodness it is absolutely incredible how
[1:10:47] you feel I have been so low in my spirit
[1:10:51] at times and the longer I'm there my
[1:10:53] physical body will start reacting and
[1:10:56] responding and I guarantee if I went to
[1:10:59] a doctor that check my respiration they
[1:11:01] check my heart they checked all those
[1:11:03] things and said there's nothing wrong
[1:11:04] with you there's absolutely nothing
[1:11:06] wrong you're this is good and that is
[1:11:08] good and that is good it's all just
[1:11:10] psychological well in one way they're
[1:11:12] right but it's more than the psyche of
[1:11:15] man it's in the second realm of man
[1:11:17] which is man's Spirit you know what I'm
[1:11:19] saying don't you when you get down and
[1:11:21] you get weary and you read the Bible you
[1:11:24] listen to tapes you go to church and
[1:11:26] you're pressing and you're trying your
[1:11:28] best and it seemed like you just cannot
[1:11:30] get what you need from God what's going
[1:11:32] on that's when God is allowing us to be
[1:11:36] tried and we must prove to God day one
[1:11:39] day two through day 12. I am not giving
[1:11:43] up God I am not turning back not only to
[1:11:46] God but let the devil know you ain't
[1:11:48] knocking me out I'm a Child of God I'm a
[1:11:51] daughter of God I'm a son of God
[1:11:55] notice this is from a man who understood
[1:11:59] weariness oh my you know imagine how low
[1:12:03] that Paul must have seen sometimes
[1:12:05] sitting in the Roman prisoners you know
[1:12:07] he was in there like three to four times
[1:12:09] whenever he wrote some of the great
[1:12:11] Epistles of the New Testament and spoke
[1:12:13] about being free that man was spreading
[1:12:16] about freedom and being free in Christ
[1:12:19] Jesus setting locked up in a prison
[1:12:22] couldn't receive his friends could not
[1:12:24] go out and preach How could a man that
[1:12:26] was thrown in jail write about Freedom
[1:12:29] you think that man didn't get weary you
[1:12:31] think he didn't get down and thank God
[1:12:33] what in the world am I doing in prison
[1:12:35] I'd be so much better off out there
[1:12:37] preaching I'm a preacher Lord I'm an
[1:12:40] apostle I'm a prophet how can I how can
[1:12:42] I be in the will of God not out there
[1:12:44] well let me tell you something whenever
[1:12:46] brother Eugene Kennedy passed I was
[1:12:49] there visiting his wife and his son
[1:12:50] they're here tonight and his other
[1:12:52] family members his brother and a few
[1:12:54] more that was our brother her and while
[1:12:57] we were sitting there talking before
[1:12:58] brother Eugene passed and the Lord just
[1:13:01] dropped some inspiration down there and
[1:13:03] give me assault and I told them I said
[1:13:05] you know some people are known in life
[1:13:07] for what they do and what they
[1:13:09] accomplish and they can do this and that
[1:13:12] and the other and then but the lord gave
[1:13:14] me this thought some people are known
[1:13:16] for what they do but they're known for
[1:13:19] what they're not allowed to do but the
[1:13:21] Eugene was a very talented individual he
[1:13:24] told me that to wash her the dryer would
[1:13:27] tear up he would lay there in the bed
[1:13:29] unable to get up and he would tell
[1:13:31] sister Johnny to get a screwdriver and
[1:13:33] get a 3 16 socket and get this and that
[1:13:36] and the other and Sister Janet fixed
[1:13:37] their dryers several times via him
[1:13:40] laying in the bed don't you know he
[1:13:42] would much rather got up himself and
[1:13:44] took those tools but he was not known
[1:13:47] just for what he could do but he
[1:13:49] remained faithful when God took it away
[1:13:52] from him come on Sheldon you understand
[1:13:54] what I'm saying oh how many people are
[1:13:57] sick and would love to come to the house
[1:13:59] of God how many people that love to be
[1:14:01] up and about and doing their housework
[1:14:03] and this and that and the other but yet
[1:14:06] God In His glory somehow is going to use
[1:14:09] their testimony for a greater portion of
[1:14:12] the glory of God they're not just known
[1:14:14] for what they do but they're known for
[1:14:17] what they're deprived of doing and yet
[1:14:19] they are still faithful they get up and
[1:14:22] say the lord gave and the Lord took away
[1:14:24] but I said be the name of the Lord oh
[1:14:28] it's on those non-muraculous days those
[1:14:31] non-eventful days it's not hard to
[1:14:34] praise God when the walls are laying
[1:14:36] crumble down everywhere it's not hard to
[1:14:39] praise God whenever we turn in a
[1:14:41] testimony and here's a scan of a gross
[1:14:44] and here's another scan three years
[1:14:46] later and the growth is gone well my
[1:14:48] goodness nearly anybody can shout
[1:14:49] somebody that ain't never even shouted
[1:14:51] it feels like running around with a
[1:14:53] little bit but whenever the doctor says
[1:14:55] it's bad yeah well nevertheless or
[1:14:57] whoevermore says it don't look good can
[1:14:59] you still say praise God eyebrow was
[1:15:02] brought on the Earth by the Lord and the
[1:15:05] devil cannot take me all we need to
[1:15:08] remind him Hallelujah you don't belong
[1:15:10] to the devil I don't belong to the devil
[1:15:13] my life is not his your life is not his
[1:15:17] he cannot take me he cannot control me
[1:15:20] he cannot control you even unknown
[1:15:24] miraculous days my God is still God even
[1:15:28] though non-eventful days my God is a
[1:15:31] winner and I am a winner my God if they
[1:15:35] conqueror and I am a conqueror
[1:15:47] let us not be weary
[1:15:52] to be utterly
[1:15:54] spiritless
[1:15:57] to be wearing out
[1:16:00] and exhausted
[1:16:03] anybody ever get exhausted maybe some of
[1:16:05] you just feel plum
[1:16:07] tuckered out
[1:16:09] that's a good theological term man
[1:16:11] just just wore out you know Daniel
[1:16:14] prophesied that that would be one of the
[1:16:17] things that Satan would do in the last
[1:16:18] days that he would try to wear out the
[1:16:22] Saints he doesn't give up on the many of
[1:16:25] your souls he doesn't see that Pillar of
[1:16:27] Fire apparently hanging in that realm of
[1:16:28] your soul he knows I can't do none of
[1:16:31] that Soul no more but I'm sure aggravate
[1:16:33] their spirit I can sure aggravate their
[1:16:35] thoughts I can sure aggravate their mind
[1:16:37] I'll try to just wear them out make them
[1:16:40] weary all that I'm going to church and
[1:16:42] just let them go there and set like a
[1:16:43] bump on a pickle no well not bumps and
[1:16:45] we're not pickles we come here to
[1:16:47] worship God the Bible says we are Lively
[1:16:49] stones in the house of the Lord so we've
[1:16:53] not come just to take up space we've not
[1:16:55] come well I reckon I'll go I ain't going
[1:16:57] to get nothing out of it no we need to
[1:17:00] go and say Lord tonight might be my
[1:17:02] night but if it ain't tonight I'm coming
[1:17:04] back Sunday and if it ain't Sunday I'm
[1:17:06] coming back Wednesday and I'm coming
[1:17:09] back to next Sunday because my day is
[1:17:12] coming
[1:17:17] let us not be weary
[1:17:20] and well doing anybody here ever been
[1:17:22] weary and well done
[1:17:24] a few of us
[1:17:25] and God bless you cherubim Center here
[1:17:27] with us tonight we're so happy that you
[1:17:28] would grace us with your presence
[1:17:31] I guarantee you we've been weary
[1:17:33] this is from a man himself
[1:17:36] who become weary let us Paul's talking
[1:17:39] to himself let us not be weary
[1:17:43] and well done you mean a person can get
[1:17:46] weary in doing great
[1:17:49] and doing well they're doing exactly
[1:17:52] what God wants them to do but for a
[1:17:53] brother Fred how can that be because
[1:17:55] it's them non-miraculous days
[1:17:58] that you can get so
[1:18:03] I'll tell you one thing I love getting
[1:18:04] great testimonies in the emails and
[1:18:07] texts and things like that I can't wait
[1:18:09] to share them with people
[1:18:10] it's so encouraging
[1:18:13] but it can be a little bit circular
[1:18:16] whenever you're waiting from one
[1:18:18] testimony to another
[1:18:20] unless of course by eyes of Faith you
[1:18:22] say I'm going to go ahead and declare it
[1:18:24] another one's in the mailbox
[1:18:27] there's another one on the way oh Glory
[1:18:31] let us not be weary and well doing far
[1:18:35] in
[1:18:38] ah
[1:18:40] not our season
[1:18:42] but due season
[1:18:44] in due season we shall reap if
[1:18:49] we
[1:18:50] faint not now look at this word it's
[1:18:53] from the same group rather and it means
[1:18:59] to dissolve
[1:19:01] so if we don't fail or dissolve
[1:19:06] if we just don't dissolve metaphorically
[1:19:10] to weaken relax
[1:19:13] exhaust
[1:19:15] to be in feebled through exhaustion
[1:19:21] to be in feebled through exhaustion to
[1:19:26] grow weak to grow weary
[1:19:29] to be tired out
[1:19:33] to desponde and become
[1:19:37] faint-hearted
[1:19:40] so we will reap
[1:19:43] as long as we don't become this
[1:19:47] despondent
[1:19:48] faint-hearted
[1:19:51] well I guess I just
[1:19:53] I guess I just ain't gonna get my
[1:19:55] healing
[1:19:57] I guess I might as well just
[1:20:00] accept it
[1:20:01] I'll always be crippled I'll always be
[1:20:05] this or that or the other I I might as
[1:20:07] well just because I've tried and I've
[1:20:09] tried
[1:20:10] I've walked six miles around this city
[1:20:14] ain't nothing happened yet
[1:20:16] it's easy for anybody to see I'm just
[1:20:20] making circles
[1:20:22] and this arthritis is so painful
[1:20:25] I reckon I might as well just go ahead
[1:20:27] and sign up for it
[1:20:31] well I guarantee one thing if you sign
[1:20:33] up for it the devil will have the FedEx
[1:20:35] guy
[1:20:36] by the end of the week with another box
[1:20:38] for you
[1:20:40] and then but next week he'll have three
[1:20:41] or four more special deliveries for you
[1:20:44] so if I was you even through the pain
[1:20:46] and The Agony and the tears I'd box up
[1:20:50] that bunch of snakes and sent them right
[1:20:52] back straight to hell and said that
[1:20:54] ain't mine
[1:20:55] you get out of here devil you're a liar
[1:20:58] I may be having a non-eventful day I may
[1:21:02] be having a non-miraculous day but on
[1:21:06] this non-miraculous day I'm still
[1:21:09] praising God oh what are you going to do
[1:21:11] today brother Donnie I'm going to
[1:21:13] package up them rattlesnakes and say
[1:21:15] Return to Sender
[1:21:17] Return to Sender you've got the wrong
[1:21:20] address
[1:21:21] well don't you live at 209 Quail Run
[1:21:24] Court well that's where my body lives at
[1:21:27] but my soul is residing in Heavenly
[1:21:29] places in Christ Jesus so if you've got
[1:21:32] depression don't deliver to my doorstep
[1:21:34] I don't want it I ain't got time to be
[1:21:37] depressed I ain't got time come on
[1:21:40] children I ain't got time to listen to
[1:21:42] the lies of the devil I ain't got time
[1:21:45] to say feel sorry for myself I ain't got
[1:21:48] time to say well devil I'll compromise
[1:21:50] with you there ain't no compromising
[1:21:52] born in my body I'll fight until I ain't
[1:21:56] got no more breath to fight with I'll
[1:21:59] preach until I can't preach no more I'll
[1:22:02] sing I'll shout I'll worship I'll praise
[1:22:06] Hallelujah I got time for the devil I
[1:22:10] ain't got time for you Satan
[1:22:22] notice Joshua 6 16 and it came to pass
[1:22:27] at the seventh time
[1:22:30] when the priests blew at the trumpets
[1:22:32] Joshua said unto the people
[1:22:35] nod
[1:22:39] and they all started nodding
[1:22:44] Joshua said unto the people
[1:22:50] for the Lord
[1:22:52] has given you
[1:22:55] the city do you understand he was giving
[1:22:58] it to him on day one
[1:23:01] day two day three now remember he's done
[1:23:04] said it past tense the Lord has already
[1:23:06] given it to you that's why people think
[1:23:07] we're absolutely crazy whenever we claim
[1:23:10] our healing
[1:23:12] and you may actually get worse after you
[1:23:14] make that claim and you accept that
[1:23:16] promise is yours I'll tell you one thing
[1:23:18] I've been studying some this evening and
[1:23:20] looking up on the Bill of Rights and all
[1:23:21] that and looking at some more things and
[1:23:23] I found some absolutely astounding
[1:23:25] statements that the prophet said the
[1:23:27] devil has not one legal right against
[1:23:29] you and I but you know what he is he's a
[1:23:32] bluff and a liar I said he's a bluff and
[1:23:35] a liar also found that astounding that
[1:23:38] he said the Lord Jesus robbed the devil
[1:23:41] I thought isn't that ironic so the Lord
[1:23:44] Jesus robbed the biggest robber that's
[1:23:46] ever been so he robbed him and took away
[1:23:49] from him any Authority or any power that
[1:23:53] he had he pulled all of his teeth he
[1:23:56] ain't got no power against you as a
[1:23:58] Believer and then he gives you the Holy
[1:24:01] Ghost to believe his word and enforce
[1:24:04] the promise in your soul
[1:24:07] glory to God
[1:24:13] now listen how it works
[1:24:17] listen to Prophet now now if you'll
[1:24:19] notice the subconscious
[1:24:21] is where you live
[1:24:24] that's where you yourself live
[1:24:27] that's the reason it's people it's hard
[1:24:29] for them to have faith
[1:24:31] up here
[1:24:33] first they say yes
[1:24:35] I got faith
[1:24:37] but down in here something says
[1:24:40] but it's not for you
[1:24:42] now part of it is the conscience and the
[1:24:45] other the subconscious of course the
[1:24:47] conscience works on mental Faith from
[1:24:48] the mind
[1:24:49] it's like a ship going across the sea
[1:24:52] the man up here in the deck you look at
[1:24:57] him and you say he's running the ship no
[1:24:59] he isn't running the ship
[1:25:01] the man down on the bowels of the ship
[1:25:03] is running the ship the engineer not
[1:25:06] what if hit ring a sign down through and
[1:25:08] say so many knots forward and the man
[1:25:10] down there would ring and go backwards
[1:25:14] so the man up front the guy with the
[1:25:16] writtenhouse had on the written eye
[1:25:18] Squad at five you know the outfit
[1:25:19] spotless just walks around everybody
[1:25:21] said yes sir yes sir yes sir and he says
[1:25:24] so many nights forward
[1:25:26] but the man down in the engine room says
[1:25:28] I'm going backwards
[1:25:31] now which way do you figure they're
[1:25:33] going to go well the man down there has
[1:25:36] got the controls
[1:25:38] you see this is the way we are
[1:25:42] oh my now notices he says the man down
[1:25:46] there would ring and go back or say what
[1:25:48] if he'd say go to the right and he'll
[1:25:50] turn to the left
[1:25:51] and the man that bear couldn't steer it
[1:25:53] the man died on the inside is the one
[1:25:55] that sends the ship well this fella up
[1:25:58] here says I believe God heals
[1:26:02] mm-hmm
[1:26:04] and I believe is the same yesterday
[1:26:06] today and forever and your subconscious
[1:26:09] down there says
[1:26:11] but it's not for you
[1:26:17] so the man up here to Hallelujah I
[1:26:20] believe Hebrews searching it yes sir I
[1:26:22] believe it's the truth and then when you
[1:26:24] go to declaring it I'm Healed
[1:26:26] I'm Healed
[1:26:28] let me knows what I'm talking about that
[1:26:29] little fear that little something there
[1:26:31] will kind of holds you back in what it
[1:26:33] is it's the guy in the engine room
[1:26:36] it's the subconscious and the
[1:26:38] subconscious don't want you to say what
[1:26:41] he says
[1:26:43] I remember years ago when I preached on
[1:26:44] that about the Titanic and the iceberg
[1:26:46] and how did it ripped the side of it and
[1:26:48] it was from the bottom down that it was
[1:26:49] basically the same thing here now he
[1:26:52] says notice well the fell up here I
[1:26:54] believe God heals and I believe it's the
[1:26:56] same yesterday and forever and your
[1:26:57] subconscious down there says but it's
[1:26:59] not for you now watch him he goes on to
[1:27:01] say you imagine this in 1954. now if you
[1:27:04] get the man up there to say forward
[1:27:07] I'm the man down here say forward
[1:27:11] you'll go forward
[1:27:13] if you can get God to say
[1:27:17] I'm the Lord that healer said the first
[1:27:20] conscience said I'm the Lord that he
[1:27:22] that seem and the subconscious say I'm
[1:27:26] the Lord that healeth say you're going
[1:27:28] forward
[1:27:29] [Applause]
[1:27:32] to God
[1:27:34] not whenever the subconscience aligns
[1:27:37] with God's word and the first conscience
[1:27:40] aligns with God's word guess what you do
[1:27:43] you break out of your circles
[1:27:48] the having flown in different parts of
[1:27:50] the world and many of you all know
[1:27:51] having flown into Atlanta that Atlanta
[1:27:53] does not get the title of being the
[1:27:56] world's busiest airport for nothing many
[1:28:00] a Time whether coming into Atlanta or
[1:28:02] going coming out you know coming from
[1:28:04] Tri-Cities or coming from wherever
[1:28:06] Johannesburg South Africa whoever coming
[1:28:08] from and you will get into your flight
[1:28:11] pass and then the captain will come on
[1:28:14] ladies and gentlemen the traffic is
[1:28:16] backed up and we're going to be circling
[1:28:19] Atlanta so they will have this flight
[1:28:22] flight 343 from Johannesburg South
[1:28:25] Africa well they got another one coming
[1:28:26] from Istanbul they've got another one
[1:28:29] coming from Cairo Egypt they've got
[1:28:30] another one coming from Tri-Cities and
[1:28:32] the other one from Asheville another one
[1:28:34] from Charlotte another one from here
[1:28:35] well what do they do they put them all
[1:28:37] out now here they are circling around
[1:28:40] Atlanta
[1:28:41] well I'm glad they space them apart
[1:28:44] don't you I'm really glad they face them
[1:28:46] apart so here you go I mean you're going
[1:28:49] like this I've set right there another
[1:28:50] thing Lord don't let this thing fall out
[1:28:52] of the air I mean you're just going
[1:28:54] around and around and around well I
[1:28:57] can't do that long I gotta have a
[1:28:58] straight path what do you do you find
[1:29:01] yourself going around and then the
[1:29:03] powerless voice will come on and say
[1:29:05] ladies and gentlemen we have been
[1:29:08] cleared to land
[1:29:09] well whenever they say that then the
[1:29:12] stewardess is of course I'm moving up
[1:29:13] and down picking up any paper and cups
[1:29:16] and all that sort of thing and you can
[1:29:18] feel the cabinets that goes to change
[1:29:20] him and you can feel as it's going down
[1:29:22] down down you could watch it and then I
[1:29:24] would always listen for is a landing
[1:29:26] gear and the landing gear will come down
[1:29:27] I never did like the thoughts of landing
[1:29:29] on the belly of that thing so I'm always
[1:29:31] glad when I hear that thing go and then
[1:29:34] another and then the one up front the
[1:29:36] nose gear and they say yeah here we are
[1:29:38] here we come in like this why because we
[1:29:41] got out of the circle what are we doing
[1:29:43] where are we going nowhere or something
[1:29:46] going around and around flight 13 is
[1:29:49] going around and around and the
[1:29:51] methodists are going around and around
[1:29:53] and the Baptists are going around and
[1:29:55] around and if we're not careful that's
[1:29:57] his message people we'll just make our
[1:29:59] own Circle and shot the same path I
[1:30:01] would just well we go to church and we
[1:30:03] do this and we all gather over to the
[1:30:05] fellowship hall I don't want that to be
[1:30:08] our church I don't want that to be our
[1:30:10] destiny we don't want her to get in a
[1:30:13] circle well we don't pray and we don't
[1:30:15] praise and we don't worship and we don't
[1:30:18] reach out to God even on non-miraculous
[1:30:22] days we're going to praise him
[1:30:33] When God says I'm the Lord that he will
[1:30:36] see and the subconscience or this
[1:30:38] conscience said I believe it's so and
[1:30:42] the subconscious said
[1:30:44] are you quite sure
[1:30:49] you see some of these voices that y'all
[1:30:51] have heard been hearing and you're
[1:30:53] thinking it's demons it's worse than
[1:30:55] that it's you
[1:30:59] understand sometimes it's a lot easier
[1:31:01] to get rid of that devil than it is get
[1:31:03] rid of your thinking
[1:31:08] so you're thinking the devil doing this
[1:31:10] and the devil said it's that man down
[1:31:12] the engine room he's afraid he's afraid
[1:31:14] to say
[1:31:15] speak to this body and say in the name
[1:31:17] of Jesus turn me loose
[1:31:20] Hallelujah I read a court this evening
[1:31:22] and send it to Erica
[1:31:24] brother random said I want those of you
[1:31:26] that are sick
[1:31:27] I'm going to per say this prayer but I
[1:31:31] want you to pray it
[1:31:32] surely he said you think that I know how
[1:31:36] to defeat demons
[1:31:38] so I'm going to tell you what to say
[1:31:42] praise God
[1:31:45] so he began to say the words and you
[1:31:47] listen to the tape and you can hear the
[1:31:49] people as the people are repeating the
[1:31:52] words because he's standing there oh
[1:31:55] Glory he's standing there oh he knows
[1:31:58] his position day seven has arrived
[1:32:02] [Applause]
[1:32:03] you imagine as them Devils started
[1:32:05] clearing out of that place oh my
[1:32:07] goodness as that Prophet began to put
[1:32:10] the right words the right words of
[1:32:13] victory in the mouths of those people
[1:32:16] and they said now I'm going to say it
[1:32:18] but I want you to pray it and he begins
[1:32:21] to tell them what to say now Satan
[1:32:23] you've lost all legal rights come out of
[1:32:26] me leave my body in the name of Jesus
[1:32:30] Christ you can hear the people as they
[1:32:32] go to rejoice and blessing God why
[1:32:35] because that devil or Hallelujah had to
[1:32:39] obey those words that were given to that
[1:32:42] Prophet from God
[1:32:44] I'll tell you a friend when we can line
[1:32:46] up the subconscious and the first
[1:32:48] conscience with God's promise day seven
[1:32:51] has arrived
[1:32:53] oh thank you Lord God
[1:32:59] oh my let me jump down here read the
[1:33:02] southern we'll close her shortly
[1:33:03] thinking on our way Cleveland Tennessee

[1:33:11] that'll just set their hearts of Fire
[1:33:14] many thousands be brought to Christ let
[1:33:17] it start now Lord and Scatter throughout
[1:33:19] the world air the coming of the Lord
[1:33:21] Jesus on the pressing times and the
[1:33:24] battle and the fog will be low
[1:33:28] and we will not know
[1:33:31] which way to go you know David said it
[1:33:34] this way that it would come the people
[1:33:36] would be at the place they would be at
[1:33:40] their wits end
[1:33:42] their wits end
[1:33:45] they would know what else to do they
[1:33:47] wouldn't know the way out they would
[1:33:49] know which way to turn
[1:33:51] we're their friends
[1:33:53] notice he said
[1:33:55] the fog will be low and we will not know
[1:33:58] which way to go
[1:33:59] but be walking
[1:34:07] let us find him
[1:34:10] praise God
[1:34:11] let us find him now
[1:34:14] who is a very present help in the time
[1:34:17] of trouble can you imagine now you're
[1:34:19] the prophet is relating a time when we
[1:34:21] would walk in circles and we would need
[1:34:24] him
[1:34:25] to help get us out of this vicious cycle
[1:34:30] if you're in that cycle tonight whether
[1:34:32] it's a besetting sin or you're dealing
[1:34:34] with this sickness or this disease and
[1:34:36] instead of getting better it's getting
[1:34:38] worse let us find him tonight
[1:34:41] this this is in Cleveland Tennessee just
[1:34:44] uh East there I guess it would be out of
[1:34:46] uh out before you get to Chattanooga
[1:34:48] those of you that are familiar with the
[1:34:49] area and brother Brennan and the further
[1:34:51] part of this quote in the beginning of
[1:34:52] it he says God May there be a Revival
[1:34:54] that'll Break Forth in Tennessee House
[1:34:56] of praise God Amen
[1:35:00] let us find him now who is present
[1:35:03] present help in the time of troubles
[1:35:06] for we ask it in his name
[1:35:08] and for his glory
[1:35:11] Deuteronomy chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:35:13] then we turned and took our journey into
[1:35:16] the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea
[1:35:19] as the Lord spake unto me and we can
[1:35:22] pass Mount Sierra many days
[1:35:26] uh-huh you know what the word Compass
[1:35:28] means
[1:35:30] and circle
[1:35:31] so we went around and around and around
[1:35:36] and around Mount Sierra
[1:35:41] and the Lord spake unto me saying ye
[1:35:45] have compassed
[1:35:48] look at the meaning of it surround in
[1:35:51] circle be brought around to March or
[1:35:56] walk around Circle about make a circuit
[1:36:02] God said you have been walking in this
[1:36:05] circle this mountain long enough
[1:36:09] turn you northward
[1:36:15] praise God
[1:36:17] praise God
[1:36:20] Marching In Circles
[1:36:22] let me close my mind goes back to one
[1:36:26] more individual
[1:36:27] by the name of Samson
[1:36:31] a man that great tool for God
[1:36:35] but he kept fooling my sayings until it
[1:36:39] finally overtook it
[1:36:41] it flew with it and repent and go back
[1:36:44] at it again and repent go back at it
[1:36:46] again but eventually under Delilah it
[1:36:50] took him
[1:36:51] got his eyes God is Covenant got his
[1:36:54] strengths
[1:36:56] and now they've got Samson chained to a
[1:36:59] meal
[1:37:00] you imagine him as he goes around
[1:37:03] and round
[1:37:05] and round not a trapezoid not a pyramid
[1:37:09] of seven Church ages
[1:37:11] but a circle
[1:37:13] and the Philistines meal grinding meal
[1:37:17] for the flower and their biscuits and
[1:37:20] their bread laughing ridiculing making
[1:37:24] fun of him
[1:37:25] but the Bible says his hair began to
[1:37:29] grow back out
[1:37:31] what was it the seventh day was fixing
[1:37:33] to arrive
[1:37:36] praise God but in
[1:37:39] non-miraculous days
[1:37:42] Samson was repenting in non-miraculous
[1:37:46] days the prophet uses him on this
[1:37:49] character whenever he preaches about
[1:37:50] thinking on your way and he said Samson
[1:37:54] begin to think on his way and he began
[1:37:58] to remember those great days of Victory
[1:38:00] and we remember of course what happened
[1:38:03] the table is having a great celebration
[1:38:06] for Dagon
[1:38:08] and the prophet tells us that this great
[1:38:10] Coliseum was built in the shape of a
[1:38:14] mushroom so it was real large canopy on
[1:38:18] the top and had two great pillars
[1:38:20] structurally designed so the weight of
[1:38:24] the whole canopy of the top of the
[1:38:26] mushroom would be on these two pillars
[1:38:29] how many non-miraculous days did he have
[1:38:34] they would go round and round and they'd
[1:38:36] barely feed him beat him ridicule him
[1:38:39] make fun of him Oh Glory but in these
[1:38:43] non-miraculous days he was repenting
[1:38:46] getting right with God
[1:38:49] had a victory coming forth
[1:38:52] oh when they bring him out and he's let
[1:38:54] out by a little lad not a great guy but
[1:38:58] a little small child more humiliation
[1:39:01] and he speaks to the little lad and said
[1:39:03] Place me next to the pillars
[1:39:06] and Samson began to feel and his hair
[1:39:09] had already grown out what was happening
[1:39:11] inch by inch day by day his hair was
[1:39:15] growing repentance was adding The Virtue
[1:39:19] to his body and the Covenant was being
[1:39:22] restored all those non-miraculous days
[1:39:26] is going to lead to the biggest Miracle
[1:39:28] of his entire life
[1:39:32] praise the Lord
[1:39:33] and as Samson stands out and he said oh
[1:39:37] Lord
[1:39:38] one more time remember me Remember Me
[1:39:43] Lord once more and the spirit of God
[1:39:46] came on him and he began to push on them
[1:39:49] two pillars and that great
[1:39:51] mushroom-shaped Coliseum begin to shiver
[1:39:53] and Quake and Shake unto the power of
[1:39:55] God and the Bible tells us that Samson
[1:39:59] killed more the day of his death than he
[1:40:03] did his entire lifetime
[1:40:05] why those non-miraculous days led to the
[1:40:10] ultimate victory of his life sometimes
[1:40:12] we look and well Ma how many prayers
[1:40:14] have we prayed for brother Eugene
[1:40:16] Kennedy how many prayers have we prayed
[1:40:18] for others and yet the Lord took a
[1:40:20] moment we say oh no oh that was wasted
[1:40:23] by no means it was not wasted at all God
[1:40:26] heard every prayer that we pray
[1:40:28] concerning those things and God had a
[1:40:30] will that's absolutely right I we can't
[1:40:33] determine that we have no way to know
[1:40:35] who it is or who is that well brother
[1:40:37] Donnie because we pray for someone they
[1:40:39] die shall we continue on absolutely a
[1:40:42] death sentence from one does not mean
[1:40:44] it's a death sentence for the other Only
[1:40:47] God Can decree that don't you let the
[1:40:50] devil even use a saint as your example
[1:40:53] because that Saints life come to an end
[1:40:55] it does not mean your life is going to
[1:40:58] come to an end if God's going to draw
[1:41:00] you God will let you know God's Prophet
[1:41:04] said he will never all you from the
[1:41:07] earth until he makes it known to you
[1:41:18] foreign
[1:41:35] so where are you
[1:41:47] if I get stuck in this circle for six
[1:41:50] months
[1:41:51] y'all might as well plan on me being
[1:41:52] back
[1:41:55] I'm not going to stay home
[1:41:58] if I don't feel him
[1:42:00] if I pray and you don't answer I'm not
[1:42:02] staying home
[1:42:03] now you may think that works for you but
[1:42:05] I'm going to tell you right now it don't
[1:42:07] work for you either
[1:42:08] no that don't work for you it's crazy
[1:42:10] how people do it they stay away from
[1:42:12] church so that's the worst thing that
[1:42:13] they could do that's the very thing they
[1:42:15] need to do is keep coming back and keep
[1:42:18] showing God on those non-miraculous days
[1:42:20] I'm going to appraise you I'm going to
[1:42:22] love you I'm going to adore you I'm
[1:42:24] going to raise my hands if I don't feel
[1:42:26] one thing I'm going to praise you Lord
[1:42:28] God Because of Who You Are
[1:42:32] friends we praise God for the wrong
[1:42:35] reason we're supposed to praise him
[1:42:37] because of who he is not what you feel
[1:42:42] you don't praise God because of what you
[1:42:44] feel and what you get out of it you
[1:42:47] praise him because of who he is he's the
[1:42:51] almighty he's the omnipotent he's
[1:42:53] wonderful he's all-powerful whenever you
[1:42:56] get that right in your head you'll
[1:42:58] praise him whether you feed him or
[1:42:59] whether you don't
[1:43:10] now let me share this with you well the
[1:43:13] most difficult parts of this journey
[1:43:15] is trying to figure out
[1:43:19] is God got me in this circle
[1:43:22] and he's trying me
[1:43:24] or if Satan got me in this circle
[1:43:27] trying to Blind me
[1:43:31] you see it wasn't the devil that got
[1:43:33] them in that Circle of marching around
[1:43:34] Jericho God did that
[1:43:37] and God will let you and I go in those
[1:43:39] things in our life just to see he's
[1:43:42] going to try you
[1:43:43] almighty God is going to try you I ain't
[1:43:46] talking about being tempted to the devil
[1:43:47] I'm talking about almighty God trying
[1:43:49] you
[1:43:50] to see if you will become weary and you
[1:43:53] will just take the back seat
[1:43:56] God will try you
[1:44:00] well when he tries me I want to be like
[1:44:03] oh Jacob now Lord
[1:44:04] I'll hurt you
[1:44:07] back off Lord I'll hurt you
[1:44:10] you understand what I'm saying
[1:44:12] well some of your recipient weak
[1:44:13] goodness gracious a little over a little
[1:44:15] neck
[1:44:19] what are you going to do when God
[1:44:21] himself meets you and said out of my way
[1:44:22] Dave you stand and say no Jesus I don't
[1:44:25] want to hurt you but I will if I have to
[1:44:26] I got to be changed I got to be changed
[1:44:29] I can't leave this face you'll imagine
[1:44:31] oh Jacob says Lord I'm telling you I
[1:44:33] will hurt you I will hurt you of course
[1:44:34] I found out who got hurt out of that
[1:44:36] Hill didn't we but his mind was made up
[1:44:38] he walked in their hole and he walked
[1:44:40] out a limp and Prince but he was never
[1:44:42] the same again whatever I've got to do
[1:44:46] whatever you got to do that's what he
[1:44:49] wants
[1:44:54] so if you're on this Merry-Go-Round of a
[1:44:56] besetting singing
[1:44:58] why don't you stop that thing tonight
[1:45:03] at Miracle around and say wait a minute
[1:45:06] I'm sick of this
[1:45:11] you're married folks your marriage up
[1:45:13] and down and in and out and up and down
[1:45:15] and fuss and arguing and fighting you
[1:45:16] think you're going to leave a big
[1:45:17] argument and a big fuss and go find a
[1:45:19] way in a Rapture I'm telling you you're
[1:45:21] not
[1:45:23] you need to have peace in your home
[1:45:26] you need to stop that argument
[1:45:28] the Bible says obey them that have the
[1:45:31] rule over you so I am telling every one
[1:45:34] of you quit fussing and arguing

[1:46:00] get them three folks lined up God you
[1:46:03] and you
[1:46:06] to where you can all say the same thing
[1:46:08] I don't have to live this way
[1:46:10] I do not I feel it this way
[1:46:15] praise God
[1:46:18] a man wants to praise him on the
[1:46:20] non-miraculous days
[1:46:22] on the non-eventful Mondays well I
[1:46:25] shouldn't say that most Mondays are very
[1:46:27] eventful
[1:46:29] what gets me is I've been in the last
[1:46:31] little while it seemed like every day
[1:46:32] I'm having been Monday I'm thinking how
[1:46:34] in the world is this possible that every
[1:46:35] day is Monday
[1:46:38] but you know what I've learned the key
[1:46:39] Praise Him anyhow
[1:46:41] praise him when you're up praise him
[1:46:43] when you're down praise him when you're
[1:46:44] not even sure where yours just keep on
[1:46:45] praising him
[1:46:47] above him with all your heart
[1:46:50] you love him with all your heart
[1:46:53] if God's got you in a Jericho Circle let
[1:46:55] me tell you in the name of the Lord
[1:46:57] Jesus
[1:46:58] you will not lose
[1:47:02] unless
[1:47:04] you get weary
[1:47:07] and will doing
[1:47:09] and you lose spirit
[1:47:11] and you lose hope
[1:47:14] can you imagine Florence Nightingale
[1:47:16] laying there
[1:47:18] you've seen the picture most of you
[1:47:21] look like a skeleton
[1:47:23] skin draped over
[1:47:26] and when brother Brandon went to pray
[1:47:28] for
[1:47:29] she said pray
[1:47:31] that I can die
[1:47:35] but he said seeing God had sent me there
[1:47:37] to hold a healing campaign
[1:47:39] I didn't think I could pray she had died
[1:47:43] and then a little Dove landed over on
[1:47:45] the windowsill
[1:47:47] praise the Lord
[1:47:49] guess what her seventh day had arrived

[1:48:14] radio may happen on Saturday if it made
[1:48:16] it happen on Sunday but if it don't God
[1:48:18] has it exactly in due season
[1:48:21] Jesus is the only one that I know of
[1:48:24] that can be four days late and still on
[1:48:26] time
[1:48:27] he showed up four days late for Elijah's
[1:48:29] funeral he showed up four days later
[1:48:32] and he was right on time you may think
[1:48:36] he's like I may think he's right but
[1:48:38] whenever you think he's late he's still
[1:48:41] on time
[1:48:42] [Applause]

[1:53:14] and you go ahead and stick that foot out
[1:53:15] or you jump off or whatever you do

[1:53:51] Heavenly Father
[1:53:54] thank you for those little simple
[1:53:55] sermons in that Lord
[1:53:57] I don't know about anybody else but I
[1:54:00] needed it
[1:54:02] thank you for sending it to us Lord
[1:54:03] Jesus
[1:54:06] I pray Heavenly Father for each one here
[1:54:09] those under the sound of my voice
[1:54:12] Dear God
[1:54:14] may you help each of us
[1:54:16] to be more determined than we ever have
[1:54:19] been before
[1:54:21] days one two three on up to six
[1:54:26] even on day seven
[1:54:28] at the beginning of the March they still
[1:54:31] didn't see any movement
[1:54:34] the second trip on day seven they still
[1:54:36] didn't
[1:54:37] third fourth fifth sixth
[1:54:42] they saw no movement at all
[1:54:45] until that seventh circle
[1:54:49] and it was the seventh that broke it
[1:54:53] praise God
[1:54:55] Lord God and we know that we are in the
[1:54:58] astronaut age
[1:54:59] the seventh age
[1:55:01] early on in this age they thought it was
[1:55:04] the coming of the Lord
[1:55:06] early on they thought
[1:55:08] what happened on Azusa Street was the
[1:55:11] original restoration but we found out it
[1:55:13] wasn't
[1:55:14] they thought when you sent a prophet in
[1:55:16] those early years that the Lord would
[1:55:19] come people quit their jobs and
[1:55:21] everything in the 60s when brother
[1:55:23] Branham was here they thought the Lord
[1:55:24] was coming right there that was it
[1:55:27] Lord one day the seventh day of the
[1:55:30] seventh age of the seventh hour under
[1:55:32] the seventh seal it will all synchronize
[1:55:35] together
[1:55:37] hallelujah hallelujah and the dead and
[1:55:40] Christ shall rise first
[1:55:42] and our seventh morning oh you're the
[1:55:45] prophet called it there and Satan's
[1:55:46] eating of God this evil age when he said
[1:55:48] whenever at the dawn of that seventh
[1:55:50] morning
[1:55:51] yes Lord
[1:55:53] the Lord Jesus until that time arrives
[1:55:56] we may have some non-eventful days we
[1:56:00] may have some non-miraculous days
[1:56:02] when it will seem so monotonous we're
[1:56:05] doing the same things that did the day
[1:56:07] before and the day before but Lord we
[1:56:09] know those days are not Barren or
[1:56:11] fruitless because a life lived by the
[1:56:15] word is the word expressed
[1:56:18] Enoch did not just live loose and cold
[1:56:21] and indifferent until the very last day
[1:56:23] of his life and then he got right with
[1:56:25] God he lived many non-miraculous days
[1:56:28] and many non-eventful days but all of
[1:56:33] those days led up to that one day when
[1:56:36] it was changed
[1:56:38] praise God oh Jesus we realize that's
[1:56:41] the way the Rapture will unfold itself
[1:56:43] it's not just that great something
[1:56:45] that'll happen that last day it's a day
[1:56:47] by day walk as the Bible says Enoch
[1:56:50] walked with God and was not for God took
[1:56:54] him
[1:56:55] but he had this testimony before he left
[1:56:58] that he pleased God
[1:57:00] I want to please you on the non-eventful
[1:57:03] days Lord
[1:57:04] I want to please you on the
[1:57:05] non-miraculous days because they're
[1:57:08] building up to the miraculous times that
[1:57:10] are coming
[1:57:11] hallelujah hallelujah we love you Lord
[1:57:15] I pray you'd move among the people
[1:57:17] tonight father you see what they have
[1:57:19] need of minister to them would you Lord
[1:57:21] God
[1:57:23] in the name of Jesus
[1:57:25] praise the Lord
[1:57:28] would you do me a favor
[1:57:30] would you lay your hand over on the
[1:57:31] person standing near you there
[1:57:34] and let's just talk for a word prayer
[1:57:36] maybe they're having some of those
[1:57:38] non-eventful times of their life they're
[1:57:41] just kind of low they're not ready to
[1:57:43] quit but no means they're not ready to
[1:57:44] give up but to just find themselves
[1:57:47] going through a low spot
[1:57:50] and then really just like to have a
[1:57:51] little strength and encouragement
[1:57:53] from the Lord tonight
[1:57:56] would you just pray for them
[1:57:59] fathers we have our hands
[1:58:02] laid one upon the other we're praying
[1:58:04] for one another
[1:58:06] Lord God in the name of Jesus
[1:58:10] would you minister to the needs of your
[1:58:12] people
[1:58:13] father God I pray for my brother Garrett
[1:58:15] tonight these musicians sacrifice so
[1:58:17] much Lord
[1:58:19] I pray for strength for all of them
[1:58:21] tonight father
[1:58:22] in the name of Jesus
[1:58:24] would you minister to them Lord they
[1:58:26] give and they give and they sacrifice
[1:58:28] and they practice and they give their
[1:58:31] worship Time Lord so that the Saints can
[1:58:34] be able to enter into the service
[1:58:36] I pray father you'd minister to every
[1:58:39] one of them
[1:58:40] Lord God is musicians they're touched
[1:58:42] and they're gifted but yet Lord we also
[1:58:45] need a refreshing from you I prayed for
[1:58:48] him tonight father in the name of Jesus
[1:58:51] May the spirit of God help him if they
[1:58:53] find themselves on on a circle and they
[1:58:56] can't seem to get off of it Lord and
[1:58:58] they played the guitar they played the
[1:59:00] drums they played the bass or the piano
[1:59:03] the organ and and they do it and they do
[1:59:05] it because they're called to but Lord
[1:59:07] they need they need a refreshing from
[1:59:10] your presence I pray for them tonight
[1:59:12] father in the name of Jesus oh Lord I
[1:59:15] pray for the deacons I pray for the
[1:59:18] ministers every one of them here Lord
[1:59:20] heavenly father they sacrifice the
[1:59:23] Deacon Brothers do dear God I pray in
[1:59:25] the name of Jesus that should minister
[1:59:27] to everyone in this building tonight
[1:59:29] father and those that would love to be
[1:59:31] here and can't be here tonight father in
[1:59:33] the name of Jesus I ask you that you'll
[1:59:36] let a fresh anointing come upon Harry
[1:59:38] Lord May the spirit of God God anoint
[1:59:41] him Lord I pray I don't believe we've
[1:59:43] seen our better days I don't believe
[1:59:45] Lord we're going to live on the past
[1:59:47] memory of what we were I believe the
[1:59:50] bride's better days is laying right
[1:59:52] before her I believe great things are
[1:59:55] ahead of us as the people of God we
[1:59:58] claim it as your people the prophet
[2:00:00] tells us keep walking children of the
[2:00:03] evening light and more will unfold
[2:00:05] itself I don't believe we've yet arrived
[2:00:08] at the fullness of what you want us to
[2:00:10] be but oh God we want to come here to
[2:00:13] this place with great expectation Lord
[2:00:16] each service that we come no matter
[2:00:18] who's preaching because it might be at
[2:00:21] that particular service that you would
[2:00:23] choose to manifest yourself in a way
[2:00:25] that we've all longed to see you
[2:00:27] Heavenly Father we don't want to be in a
[2:00:30] circle here in our place we're so glad
[2:00:32] to have it and we thank you for it but
[2:00:34] we don't want to get in a routine we
[2:00:36] don't want to get into just well it's
[2:00:37] church as usual but Lord God we want to
[2:00:40] come and expect you to do the great
[2:00:43] things that you've always done the
[2:00:44] prophet said we long to have those
[2:00:47] Apostolic times moving Among Us he said
[2:00:50] we see them among us but we long to see
[2:00:52] them more and it a greater way he also
[2:00:55] told us to ask for big things and ask
