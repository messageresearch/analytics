[Music] Hey, hey, hey. [Music] Yeah. Hey. Hey. [Music] Hey. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] It is with deep sorrow and great love that we announce the passing of Marilyn Faith Wiggins, a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, and friend who went to be with the Lord on May the 28th of 2025. She was preceded in death by her beloved husband of 68 years, William Alva Wiggins, whom she married on April the 30th, 1955. Their enduring love and partnership served as a shining example of commitment and devotion. She was also preceded in death by her son Robert William Wiggins. Her parents Lillian and Allan Scott and her brother Vernon Scott. She is survived by her loving children Evelyn Marie Wiggins and William Alba Wiggins III and wife Renee. her grandchildren, Shawn Micah and Kimberly Wiggins, Brian Joseph and Sharon Wiggins, Kimberly Dawn and Josh Dixon, and Kristen Faith Wiggins, her cherished great grandchildren, Chloe Oliver and Robert Dixon, Liam and Fiona Wiggins, Cara and Avery Wiggins, and her daughter-in-law Sher Wiggins. Marilyn had a heart for caregiving and spent 24 years as a dedicated certified nursing assistant. Her compassion and gentleness touched the lives of countless patients and families. She had a true love for the simple joys of life, gardening, crocheting, and reading. But her greatest joy came from her family whom she loved deeply and unconditionally. A woman of faith, Marilyn was a proud member of Word of Life Church in Johnson City, Tennessee. Her strong Christian values guided her every step and were evident in the way that she lived her life with grace, humility, and love. She leaves behind a legacy of kindness, strength, and unwavering love that will continue to live in the hearts of all who knew her. Matthew 25:23, well done, good and faithful servant. Enter in to the joy of the Lord. On behalf of the Wiggins family, uh they want to express their love and appreciation to this assembly and to all who shared their love to them during this loss, this season of their life that they're going through. Uh we just want to say that we love the Wiggins family. They're part they're part of us and we're part of them. But they want to thank you for all the food that you've that you've sent that you brought to them. All the cards, all the calls, everything that you've done. It is very very much appreciated. And Wiggins family know this that Word of Life loves you and we hold you in our heart as well. God bless every one of you. [Music] [Applause] On the top of Mount Zion is a city and the Earth [Music] with its glory it does fill. [Music] I shall look on its beauty in the morning when I reach reach that city on the hill. Oh that city oh that city &gt;&gt; on the top of Mount Zion on the top of mountain of pure I love thee still. I'm not with thee through the air when I reach reach that city here. Oh, I'll stay here until my Savior calls me, trying daily to perform his will. Then he'll say unto me, well done up yonder. When I reach breeze that city on the hill, I'm invited to come home to that city where the word it says who soever will.

And someday only thee I'll stand where my home has been made eternal. eternal home land [Music] sweet land. I'm looking now how across that old river [Music] where my faith where my faith shall end inside. I have only just a few more, I believe it, more days to labor [Music] and then I will take my heavenly flight from this old world. Oh, beautiful land. I'm longing for you. [Music] And someday on pe I will stand. Where my home has been made eternal. to the land. Sweet Mary land. [Music] Thank you, Lord. I'm longing for you. And someday on that new land I shall stand where my home has been made eternal. Oh [Music] land, [Applause] sweet land where my home has been made eternal. Oh, sweet beauty the land sweet Mary lamb. Hallelujah. certainly wish to extend our condolences to family and friends of our departed sister. I'd like to read to you this evening from Proverbs chapter 31 verse 10. Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies. The question is who can find doesn't suggest that there aren't women that do exist like this. But the setting that Solomon wrote it so many many years ago is that they are very very rare. and hard to find. If he would have said that several thousand years ago, I wonder what he would say today. If he would come and live in Johnson City, Bristol, Kingsport for about a week and then walk around and then write this in modern terms. Wonder what he would say. Listen what he goes on to say. the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil. Now this woman is not just a natural woman that we're talking about but a woman that has been so touched by heaven's fire it is consumed innate desires of things that would be contrary to righteousness and truth. And this woman has truly found a great position. Looked over by many of course, but for those who find it, what a great thing they have found. I believe tonight that we're speaking about such a lady. The heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. Ah, that was Sister Marilyn. Ladies, those of you that are here tonight, you may never be an actress to Hollywood. You may never be a great opera singer. You may never make Hollywood's hall of fame or golden streets and your name may be written there in a star by your name. But in reality, if you make this right here, you will excel further than any Hollywood star has ever excelled. &gt;&gt; Because soon and very soon, Hollywood will be sunk. But you see the women who attained to this as our sister Evelyn started out like all other females, all other males, born lost, conceived in sin, come to the world, speaking lies, seemingly without a hope, without no ray of light to ever change us from what we were. We were deceitful in our nature. We were lost and we loved every minute of it because that was what our nature was. But one day something began to hunger in her heart. What was it? This call right here. You see, God could never have this word written had there not been somebody that would be able to respond to this. I believe I'm looking to other women that are of the same caliber right here tonight. Good comes to this husband who has this kind of wife. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life because this woman is an asset. She's not a liability. She will do him good all the days of his life. So good comes to him in such a way that he can be comforted by having her as his wife. I not only see a godly woman in this, but I see the true bride of Jesus Christ. one which will bear his reproach and bear his shame. And that the Lord Jesus is not pacing in heaven today wondering, "Will there be anybody saved? It's got so bad down on the earth and it's so dark. I'm so worried. I'm just so concerned that I've died in vain." You need to reread your Bible. Let me show you how worried he is. He's already gone away to prepare the place, and it's this close to being done. Streets have already been laid. The gates have already been hung. And the angels of God are waiting breathlessly for the last women and their husbands and their children to be completed in the economy of God. What a meeting that's going to be. She's faithful in helping him all of her life. Now notice how Solomon goes on to describe her. And he uses terms that would have been very common in that day, not so much in our day. He says, "She seeketh wool and flax and workketh willingly with her hands. She is like the merchants ships. She bringeth her food from afar." Now notice her setting. It's it's the entirety of her life and the God-given call and purpose of what he's made her to be. And things that people in this day would think, "Oh my goodness, that's nothing to even brag about. It's not a BA. It's not a PhD. It didn't come from Harvard somewhere. It didn't come from this, that, and the other." Uh I' I've studied this Bible for a long time. I've never even found the word Harvard in there. Right? &gt;&gt; Maybe I overlooked it somehow. I've not found Bob Jones University. I've not found Oxford, &gt;&gt; but I found this woman. &gt;&gt; This woman is a reflection of God's original thought of what a woman should and could be. She riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens. She considerth a field and buyth it. With the fruit of her hand she planteth a vineyard. She girthth her loins with strength and strengthenth her arms. She perceiveth that her merchandise is good. Her candle goeth not out by night. Oh my goodness. I think I need to go back to verse one and say, who can find such a woman? Are there any left? Are there any left in 2025 that God would call virtuous? Beautiful. Oh, yeah. We could find those. Rich. Yep. endowed with this and that and the other. Yes. But would God say that is a virtuous woman? You see, God's image of what he wanted Sister Marilyn to be was not what her mother and father had endowed her with at birth. To no fault of their own, they could not pass on righteousness or purity or goodness or tress or faithfulness or anything of that great thing. No doubt she had good attributes as she was a little tiny girl. But like all of us, she needed to have another birth, &gt;&gt; a birth from heaven. &gt;&gt; You see, she was born once and then somewhere in that time frame she died and then she started living again and then she died and now she started living again. &gt;&gt; We that's complicated. No, it's not really. She was born and she lived a life of a mortal. Then she met him and she died to this world and she was reborn and started living again. And then just a while back she as we call it died but actually she didn't die. She just started living &gt;&gt; her real life. And if you and I could see her tonight, oh, by now she's already went through the sixth dimension, seen probably tens of millions of people, not angels up there flying around with wings on their back, but human beings that have been changed in a theophenic appearance and they you can feel them, touch them. No doubt her young, handsome husband was waiting for her right as she crossed the river. and her friends and her loved ones and they were giving her accolades of a great woman. Now when she passed our flag was not flown at half mass. The state of Tennessee our governor never acknowledged her and it broke all over from Nashville to Knoxville to Tri Cities to Memphis from one end of Tennessee to the other. A great lady has passed today. Most of the world never even knew it. But my Bible tells me, precious in the sight of the Lord is the deaths of his saints. What a peculiar thing to say that God would look at something that we consider so painful and something that so separates us and call it precious. What does death do? It's simply a vehicle. C certainly it takes away the animation of our body. And what it does, it brings us to our true identity of who we really are. Our spirit goes back to God who gave it. Our body goes back to the dust of the earth and our soul goes to its habitation of the master that we served. So what death does, it brings you to the tress of really who you are. And this body that you're living in tonight is not the real you anyway. It just bears an image of the life that you live. Listen what Solomon said. She layeth up her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor. Yay, she reaches forth her hands to the needy. She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet. Who can find such a woman in this day? I knew one. As a matter of fact, I have been privileged to know thousands of them. I've met them from the darkest parts of Africa into India. I walked into their homes in Tanzania. There was no carpet on the floor. As a matter of fact, there was no floor. It was dust and dirt. I've been into the houses and the homes of the people in Madras and Bombay and different parts of the world and found women just like this. Wow. But what would they all have in common? cuz some of them were former Hindu, some of them were former idol worshippers, some of them were former church members, and some of them just drunks, liars, whatever else you could imagine. But it was like a trait that ran through them all as I've seen them around the world. They never met one another. They never shook one another's hands, but it was as if though they were all from the same patronage, the same genealogy, &gt;&gt; a family trait that was in them. They might not even speak the same language. When I stood in India and preached to over 5,000 people at one time, I had an interpreter to my left, one to my right, and 20 more out there amongst all them. Thousands of people. They didn't even speak their own language, yet they lived in the same country. What was it? It was a different parent. What parent was it? Almighty God. You see, it's been his desire to have women, not only women, but men, young men, young ladies that would reflect his character. Solomon goes on to say, "She maketh herself coverings of tapestry. Her clothing is silk and purple." You see, linen is made from flax and purple is the dye made from shellfish. Her own clothing was the evidences of what her children were clothed in. Flax during part of the time frame when the Bible was written was worth more than gold ounce for ounce. purple made from the shellfish, the silicus, a little tiny insect that they would get which inhabited itself under the bark of an oak tree. And they would get one drop out of each insect. And this lady worked and labored and worked. She wasn't like a lot of the women today that give birth to their babies and put them in a dumpster and walk away from them or never even give them a chance to live. There's such a difference between what God describes as a virtuous woman. When you look at this picture of our sister, I want you to walk out of here tonight with just one thing. Forget what I've said. It's not really relevant any man what he can say. She has preached her own sermon. And when you meet a daughter of God like this, keep this in mind. This day these scriptures have been fulfilled in your hearing. And it was not in her ability nor any of these sisters here or any around the world to do this on their own. You see, a life lived by the word is the word expressed. I'm not sure that our sister would be able to quote 10 chapters in the Bible, word by word, without missing a verse. I'm not sure that she could tell you how Peter died, how James died, how Mark died, all the history of the church. I'm not sure she could do all that, but I'm sure she knew how to take a child up in her arms and love its hurts away. and be able to kiss a boo boo or whatever it was she called it and them little lips able to mend a broken heart as a mother as a grandmother as a daughter of God. So which will live the longest? If she could have left her children $10 million a piece which would last the longest? That heritage of love? You see, because money is not forever. It's only a means by which we're able to get the things in life that we so desire. But true love is eternal. Notice the evidence of her family. They were wellto-do. They were wellto-do. And it doesn't mention that it was the father that did it. It was the mother. Her husband is known in the gates when he sitth among the elders of the land. You see, a noble woman of such enhances her husband's standing. Oh, I want to stop preaching the funeral and just preach you a sermon tonight about the bride of Christ and what she does to the Lord Jesus. She enhances his name, his honor, his reputation, his character. Verse 24, she maketh fine linen, and sellth it, and deliverth girdles unto the merchant. Strength and honor are her clothing, and she shall rejoice in time to come. Many of you know the icon, the woman called Marilyn Monroe, a woman that was no doubt one of the most beautiful women in her time. And yet when she died, no one left to come and claim her body. King Henry VIII when he was laying on his bed and screaming and flames was coming up around him to engulf him. He screamed for the monks and the priests to come. And before they could get there, he finally said, "It's too late. I'm lost." Who can find a virtuous woman? No doubt he was looking for something because he sure had enough wives and he sure had enough women in his life. But having women in your life and a woman like this is not the same thing as I stand here tonight and pay tribute and honor to our sister. Though her mortal life has come to an end and we're here tonight as a memorial to her, she has just started living in that world that all of us tonight who are Christians have read about, sung about, heard about our entire life. Now, as I close, let me say this. Verse 26. She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She lookketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed, her husband also, and he praiseth her. as I went to the nursing home before her precious, precious husband passed and he said, "Brother Donnie, I'd give anything to get out of this place." I said, "Buddy, I know you would." Mean, Brother Daryl went in there with him and there was so much sickness in the nursing home and he wasn't even in a room. They had him out on a hallway and I was trying to get him out and move him around a little bit. Brother Daryl and I both knelt down there in the middle of the hallway with nurses passing by and we wept with him and cried. And I thought, "What a shape man can get in." Aren't you glad tonight, friends, that there's a land beyond this life here? Every one of us are preaching our own funeral by the way we live, what we do, the way we say. There's nothing any preacher can say that will change what you already do. All he can do honestly is use what you give him. I hope and pray to God if I'm ever rolled up here in a box. The preachers don't have to stutter and uh um uh uh well um um um boy, it's been a nice day, ain't it? Well, it's been really pretty outside today. And um I want to give them so much to work on. They don't know where to start and they don't know where to end. Is there anybody else here that feels the same way? Or do you want a stuttering funeral, a stammering funeral? Well, I heard one time that he he he bought the widow some coal and uh and he gave $5 to Goodwill. And um I I was told one time that he um took an old pair of wore out shoes and socks that had holes in them and an old dress shirt and uh dropped them off at the Salvation Army and he was a good man. Wouldn't you rather be this type of individual, men and women alike? So when you pass beyond the veil of time, that a man can say about you, words that are so true that they ring up into heaven. Now, y'all can't hear it tonight, but if you could hear the voice of the Lord Jesus, when this is preached at every one of his children's funeral, the Lord Jesus can say, "Amen." The angels of God can say, "Glory." &gt;&gt; And the archangels and the cherubams can say, "It's true. &gt;&gt; It's right." The saints of God in the sixth dimension where our sister is gathered. Hallelujah. They all could echo back the same. Would our sister Marilyn ever want to come back to this life? No. Death, the vehicle of death has settled the score and divided her back to what God wanted her to be. Separated the soul out of the body. The spirit breaks up when you die and the soul goes into that house that Paul wrote about. A house not made with hands. So what did she take with her? Her favorite house shoes, her favorite house coat, favorite pictures, none of that. You know what she took? Her character, the fulfillment of God's word in her life. And when she stands before the Lord Jesus that day, it will not be a throne of judgment. You should have done that and you should have done that and you should have done that. But to say to her, well done, my good and faithful daughter. You served me well. Enter into the joys of your Lord. I saw what you went through in life and your life wasn't easy, but I was with you. I strengthened you. I am the one that made you the fulfillment of Proverbs 31. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight, Lord, for a life that has been lived among us. Dear God, that we would be able to stand up and not lie and not have to fabricate things about her and hunt and search. Brother Louie basically read her funeral. whenever he read the orbituary put together by family members and those who knew her the closest. Was she perfect and faultless? Of course not. She was not perfect. She was just redeemed. She was not without fault. But she had a perfect blood and a perfect sacrifice that spoke for her. So all of her mistakes was hid away under the blood of the Lord Jesus. She no longer knows time. We set her memorial service to begin at 7:00. That's because us mortals still go by time. But she no longer is a subject of time. She's now been changed back to an appearance of about 18 years old. her handsome husband was standing there with her, ready to meet her at the river. All those family and friends that were privileged by the grace of God to be able to have a theophony body, they met her at the river. No doubt she's met some of the saints that she fellowship with here in our church. Neither of them were able to come to church very much in the last few years because of their health. But Lord, how many years they went to church and were faithful. Not only here, but the years they lived in Arizona. I remember seeing them in different meetings when I'd go out there and preach in Arizona. They'd always try to come up to me if they could and just speak a few words and shake my hand. But now, Lord, she'd never have to part from church again cuz she's with the church. They no longer meet in a building, but they're meeting in fields of blueg grass with rolling hills and sparkling streams of water and skies that are the ash of blue and the flowers that are the brightest yellow she's ever seen. She's never seen Fuchsia so beautiful and dynamic. And Lord, when we meet him again, it may be similar to as it was when the prophet had told someone who had lost a loved one. Whenever you see your son again, to him it will seem that it's been no more than three minutes why they broke into eternity. It certainly doesn't feel like three minutes to us, though, Lord. So, I turn my attention tonight from heaven, and I turn it toward these mortals whose hearts are broken, tears trickling out of their eyes as mine. I pray you would help us, Jesus. Bring comfort tonight, Lord, as only you can do. Dear Father, may your loving arms just wrap around them in those moments when they feel like they can't take it no more because the loss is so great. Help them to realize how blessed they were to have such a mother, a mother-in-law, a grandmother, a great grandmother, us as a church family to have her as a sister. We were blessed. Father, be with us. Lord, keep us saved. I pray there won't be a one of us missing on that day. Lord God, when you gather your people of such quality as what we've read about here tonight, what a gathering that will be. Help us, I pray. Father, in the name of Jesus, [Music] if we never meet again on this earth, my preious friend, if to God you have been true and you've lived above all sin, Then for us there'll be a meeting. Oh, your greeting. I'll see you in the rapture. [Music] Thank you, Lord. Oh, I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you in the rapture. Help me sing it. I'll meet you. I'll see you at that meeting, Sister Marilyn, over there. [Applause] There was my blessed Savior will live and reign forever. I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day. To my loved ones, let me say that there surely come a day when our Lord will come again and take his waiting bride away. So get ready now to meet him and with hallelujah. We're going to greet him. I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day. Oh, I'll see you in the rapture. Can we just praise him? See you in the rapture. I'll see you at that meeting in the air. There was our blessed savior. We're going to live and reign forever. I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day. Sister Marilyn, I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. And you see for those of us who are alive and remaining, it may be to your house that you're standing there in the mirror one day combing your hair, brushing your teeth, and you look in the mirror, and you see this beautiful young woman standing there, and you say, "Oh my Lord, it's mother. It's grandmother as you knew her. It's mother-in-law." And then you see brother Wiggins and you see this one and that one and you know it won't be long you're going to be changed. That's what we're looking for. Friends, God bless you. Thank you for attending. May the Lord Jesus and his grace comfort each of your hearts and be with you and give you strength. Harry, would you continue to sing that? Sister Evelyn had asked if we'd pray for her tonight and I'm going to step down and do for that. Would you pray with me for our sister? &gt;&gt; I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you at that meeting in the air. [Music] There with our blessed savior will live and reign forever. [Music] I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day. Oh yes, I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you when &gt;&gt; May we stand together. God bless you. Thank you for your attendance. &gt;&gt; There with our blessed Savior will live and reign forever. [Music] I see you in the rapture some sweet day. God bless you. You're dismissed. I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you at that meeting in the air. [Music] There with our blessed Savior will live and reign forever. I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music]
