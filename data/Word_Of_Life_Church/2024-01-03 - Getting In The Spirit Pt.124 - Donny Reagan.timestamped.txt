[38:01] Stand nothing compares to the promise I
[38:07] have in
[38:12] you praise the
[38:15] Lord thank you Lord
[38:17] Jesus
[38:19] amen praise the Lord Matthew chapter 16
[38:24] verse
[38:25] 18
[38:27] what a glorious thing it is to be
[38:29] children of God Amen to be able to
[38:33] share the glory of God is such an
[38:37] awesome thing for us as
[38:39] Mortals when you think about something
[38:42] that the angels of God are not allowed
[38:44] to partake
[38:46] of but yet we redeemed mortals can
[38:50] partake of something that is so sacred
[38:53] so holy of the glory of God or blessed
[38:56] people aren't
[38:58] we this is Jesus saying we've been
[39:01] looking at it I know for several
[39:03] services
[39:04] but I want you to listen carefully again
[39:07] to these scriptures
[39:09] tonight and as we read them I want you
[39:12] to think in mind now what what the Lord
[39:15] Jesus is referring
[39:17] to when we read these scriptures about
[39:20] the church and what the church is read
[39:22] it with this in mind we're talking about
[39:26] the
[39:27] government of his
[39:30] body the government so according to what
[39:33] Isaiah said the government will be upon
[39:40] his
[39:41] shoulders and his shoulders are not
[39:45] Angelic
[39:46] beings it's the
[39:49] church so when we read this keep this in
[39:52] mind now that the government of the
[39:55] kingdom of of God on the earth is the
[39:59] church not the man-made system not
[40:03] denominations and all that we don't but
[40:05] the mystical body of Jesus Christ think
[40:09] how important that the church is to the
[40:12] Lord
[40:13] Jesus and I say also unto thee that thou
[40:16] art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[40:20] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[40:23] shall not Prevail against it
[40:27] of course and the prophet quoted the
[40:28] scripture many times he said it goes to
[40:30] show the Gates of Hell will be against
[40:33] it though it is against it it will not
[40:36] Prevail we believe that right that it
[40:39] will not Prevail 1 Timothy
[40:43] 3:14 these things write I unto thee
[40:47] hoping to come unto thee
[40:49] shortly but if i tar long that thou
[40:52] mayest know how thou oughtest to behave
[40:55] thyself in the house of God in the house
[40:59] of God which is the Church of the Living
[41:05] God now we've been reading this word for
[41:08] for several several services but it's
[41:10] the word Ecclesia and listen what it is
[41:12] a gathering of citizens called out from
[41:14] their homes into some public place an
[41:17] assembly in a Christian sense an
[41:20] assembly of Christians gathered for
[41:22] worship in a religious meeting which is
[41:27] the Church of the Living God the
[41:30] pillar and the
[41:32] ground of the truth and the word ground
[41:35] is to stay prop or support so this is
[41:40] what the true church is now this is also
[41:43] facts what I'm fixing to say to you the
[41:46] majority of so-called churches around
[41:50] the world their buildings could be
[41:54] annihilated their membership ships
[41:58] destroyed their headquarters obliterated
[42:02] off the face of the
[42:03] earth and the kingdom of hell would not
[42:07] be one bit
[42:09] stronger on neither would the kingdom of
[42:12] God be one bit
[42:15] weaker because many of what we call
[42:17] churches today are not the church that
[42:20] Jesus Built as his
[42:22] own right right now remember it's not
[42:25] what you when I say a church is it's not
[42:27] our opinion well I think a church you
[42:30] have no opinion you may to yourself but
[42:33] not to God it's not what I think it's
[42:36] not what any of you think it's not what
[42:38] any board thinks or anybody else this is
[42:40] Jesus making not ours so Jesus doesn't
[42:44] even claim many of these that say that
[42:47] they are churches all they are the
[42:49] prophet defined them and he said they
[42:51] were
[42:54] lodges amen so the way God looks at it
[42:57] it's no different than a Moose Lodge an
[42:59] Elk Lodge a Deer Lodge a cow Lodge a dog
[43:02] Lodge a cat Lodge it's just a lodge
[43:06] that's all it is now they may have they
[43:08] may have his name on the side but just
[43:11] because they put it there don't mean he
[43:13] put it there and let me say it to you
[43:15] like this if the Lord God has not put
[43:18] his name among us we're no different
[43:21] than they are
[43:23] right we may say well we got a message
[43:26] church and what does that mean
[43:28] exactly because we say we believe God
[43:30] sent a prophet and we we quote the
[43:32] prophet on the occasion or whatever more
[43:34] and we think we're a church on that
[43:36] basis we're only a church of the Lord
[43:38] Jesus if the Lord Jesus himself
[43:40] establishes it and then we truly
[43:43] represent him and we are doing his
[43:46] bidding and what he says amen I hope and
[43:50] pray with all of my heart that's what we
[43:52] are
[43:54] amen one day
[43:56] The Showdown will
[43:59] come it's not going to be a Mount
[44:02] Caramel it's going to be a mountain
[44:05] Z and when that Showdown
[44:08] comes only the church that Jesus himself
[44:11] has built Will Go On The Rapture all
[44:14] others will be left here amen I don't
[44:18] want that to happen to you I don't want
[44:20] that to happen to
[44:22] me how many wants to be a part of the
[44:25] Church of the Living
[44:27] God you have a need tonight you would
[44:29] like to be remembered in prayer we have
[44:32] uh many that are sick of course I'm sure
[44:34] that most of you have heard that brother
[44:36] Scott Airwood had a an accident
[44:39] yesterday someone hit him and totally
[44:42] his truck and uh we're grateful that our
[44:45] brother um had some fractured ribs we
[44:48] grateful that he had that but we're
[44:49] grateful that he didn't have any more
[44:51] than that you already see the pictures
[44:52] of his vehicle it was the grace of God
[44:55] that was with him so we want to just
[44:57] remember him that the Lord will just be
[44:59] with our brother and strengthen him you
[45:01] hold your request in your heart tonight
[45:03] and let's just pray
[45:05] together truly heavenly father it's one
[45:08] of the greatest honors and privileges of
[45:11] our life to be able to stand in your
[45:16] presence we lord God have access to your
[45:19] throne access to your heart access to
[45:23] your ear whenever we call upon your name
[45:27] you hear us when we pray what a
[45:31] privilege our president no matter how
[45:35] the world may look at him and think he's
[45:37] such a great man and people in America
[45:40] may think he's such a great guy and
[45:42] Emperors around the world and kings and
[45:45] queens but it doesn't even mean when
[45:47] they talk you pay any attention
[45:51] whatsoever but a son or daughter of God
[45:55] can call a upon your name and Heaven
[45:58] listens amen how privileged we are Lord
[46:01] God we bring our needs our requests
[46:04] before you tonight father we're asking
[46:06] you for our brother Scott Lord that you
[46:08] just be with him and strengthen him and
[46:10] bring healing to his body with these
[46:13] fractured ribs and things that happened
[46:15] to him Lord we thank you Father for your
[46:18] grace to him Lord we know we got many
[46:20] things that are that are going on as far
[46:23] as um Co and flu and this and that and
[46:27] the other and Lord I heard from brother
[46:28] Tim puit today and they just had a
[46:31] meeting and Lord they had a lot of
[46:33] different things affect their people
[46:35] there they had to cancel church tonight
[46:38] we pray for them Father that you just
[46:40] move for every one of them Lord we know
[46:43] dear God that we're human beings and
[46:46] being your children it does not mean
[46:48] that we're exempt from these things but
[46:50] it does mean that you're with us and
[46:52] you'll help us and you'll touch us so we
[46:55] pray that you be mindful of us help me
[46:57] father that I can get out of the way
[46:59] tonight speak through me Lord your words
[47:02] I pray in the name of Jesus and the
[47:05] saints of God said amen amen God bless
[47:08] you you may be
[47:11] seated it's a law of God and a principle
[47:14] of God that I'm sure that that a lot of
[47:17] people in Christendom in this day does
[47:20] not understand it's evident by the way
[47:23] that they live and their reac action to
[47:26] God's Messengers but it is a law of God
[47:29] to be able to hear God's anointed now
[47:34] whenever I say anointed I don't mean
[47:36] someone that's just anointed to be able
[47:38] to pray for the sick and signs and
[47:40] wonders and things like that happen
[47:42] because people can be that and still be
[47:44] false of course in their Doctrine but I
[47:47] want you to watch this in spoken words
[47:48] Original Seed and the prophet here is
[47:50] referring to Isaiah 9 and6 and it says
[47:53] unto us a child is born a son is given
[47:55] his name Shall be Called counselor
[47:57] principes Mighty God Everlasting father
[48:00] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[48:02] and the government shall be upon what
[48:04] and the congregation
[48:06] replies shoulder that's the part of his
[48:09] body that's his body is it his shoulders
[48:12] in his body where's the government on
[48:15] the earth at in his body Saints shall
[48:21] judge the Earth so if the Lord Jesus has
[48:25] a government in heaven and we believe he
[48:27] does he also has a government on the
[48:31] earth because right now we are in the
[48:33] kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven has
[48:37] not yet come upon the Earth but it will
[48:39] but we are in the kingdom of God that's
[48:42] why the scripture says lo the kingdom of
[48:45] God is within you but we're longing for
[48:49] the visible kingdom of heaven when
[48:51] heaven will come down so if the kingdom
[48:54] of God is here then there must be a
[48:57] government by which that Kingdom will
[49:00] operate you cannot have a kingdom
[49:03] without having a government you agree
[49:05] with that so in that government there
[49:08] will be offices there will be people
[49:11] there will have to be of course
[49:13] magistrates as we would say people that
[49:15] will be in certain capacities to be able
[49:18] to do certain things there will be those
[49:21] that will be musicians there will be
[49:23] those that will be singers there will be
[49:25] those that will be great Authority given
[49:28] to them and there will be some that will
[49:30] be given we'll call them Church AE
[49:32] Messengers stars in the right hand of
[49:35] the Lord now watch he says in his body
[49:38] Saints shall judge the Earth Paul said I
[49:40] dare you to go to court with one another
[49:43] and not take it before the church that's
[49:45] right see Saints shall judge the Earth
[49:49] so where's the government going to be
[49:51] upon upon the shoulders his body the
[49:55] government government upon his shoulders
[49:56] that's a part of the body what is it his
[49:59] Earthly strength his Earthly strength
[50:04] God's Earthly strength is his word made
[50:09] flesh in his body here on Earth so God's
[50:15] Earthly strength is his word made flesh
[50:20] in his body on the earth now you can see
[50:24] why that so much in this day more so
[50:29] probably than any other time that has
[50:32] ever been that Satan has such an
[50:36] onslaught against the Church of the
[50:39] Living God he is against the people of
[50:43] God gathering together in a place set
[50:47] aside apart from their homes them coming
[50:51] together leaving their homes coming
[50:53] together praying assembling together
[50:56] worshiping praising the Lord turning in
[50:58] prayer requests hearing the word raising
[51:01] their hands and praising God isn't it
[51:04] amazing that we have a multitude it's
[51:07] like been an explosion in the last 25 to
[51:11] 30 years of hom groups that have risen
[51:15] up all over the world now listen to me
[51:18] carefully not just message people but
[51:21] people that are doing private home Bible
[51:24] study
[51:26] private home Gatherings but they really
[51:29] don't want a leader now what they want
[51:33] is everybody to just get together and
[51:36] we're all going to talk about it and we
[51:38] won't have no leader and we sure won't
[51:41] have no preacher and we sure won't have
[51:43] no deacons and no trustees because we
[51:46] don't believe in all of that we're going
[51:49] to be free from all of that and yet they
[51:52] think they're getting God's mind they're
[51:56] getting a God's mind all right but it's
[51:59] not the God it is the God of this evil
[52:04] age and you'll notice what happens in a
[52:07] lot of these types of settings that what
[52:10] it does it frees up the position and the
[52:14] place to where more women can come into
[52:18] the preeminent part now of course
[52:21] they're not going to take the scriptures
[52:23] to where that the women women are not
[52:26] supposed to speak in church and they're
[52:29] they naturally if they're gathering in a
[52:31] home or just a little meeting like that
[52:34] then you know it's not exactly a church
[52:37] setting so the women can get up and
[52:39] expound a little bit on the word and the
[52:42] women can kind of take over uhoh
[52:46] uhoh now they they despise the
[52:49] government of God in that God committed
[52:54] from the fall All In the Garden of Eden
[52:57] that God committed the government of the
[53:00] Old Testament body as well as the
[53:03] government of the New Testament body
[53:05] into the care of sons of God God never
[53:11] ordained a woman preacher now I can
[53:14] preach and say men if necessary but
[53:17] it'll look better on your all's Heavenly
[53:19] resume if yall say Amen
[53:22] too God never ordained women de
[53:26] God never ordained women leaders in the
[53:29] church but God called men to lead his
[53:34] church praise the Lord now are can women
[53:38] have the Holy Ghost absolutely can they
[53:41] have gifts absolutely but they're not
[53:43] going to be godall preachers because God
[53:46] never breaks his word so you can see
[53:49] then why that a lot of them would want
[53:51] to have just private home meetings and
[53:54] have little things like that to where
[53:57] that the government of the church does
[53:59] not apply to them because of course most
[54:02] of them would look at Paul and say that
[54:05] Paul was an old woman hater and Paul
[54:08] said that women were to keep silent in
[54:10] the church and if they want to learn
[54:12] anything let them ask their husbands at
[54:15] home well of course that ain't going to
[54:18] go over good and this bobhair faint
[54:21] painted face mini skirt wearing Jezebel
[54:24] religion of the age we're living in
[54:27] because the women feel like they've been
[54:29] free I'll tell you one thing Paul gave
[54:32] the women of the New Testament more
[54:34] freedom than they had ever experienced
[54:36] in their life under the law them women
[54:39] really knew what Freedom was but it
[54:42] wasn't freedom to do what they wanted to
[54:44] do and it wasn't freedom to live any way
[54:48] they wanted to live praise the Lord but
[54:51] God gave them real freedom and the only
[54:53] Freedom that there really is the real
[54:55] real freedom is freedom in the word of
[54:57] God freedom to worship freedom to praise
[55:00] Him freedom to live our lives according
[55:03] to the dictates not just of our minds
[55:06] and our opinions but the dictates from
[55:09] God's Own Heart so you can see why then
[55:13] that God's Earthly strength I remember
[55:15] what the horn in every age was to do the
[55:18] horn in every age was the church which
[55:21] was the mystical body which is given to
[55:24] protect the Lamb's rights so the lamb
[55:27] has a right to have a church a church
[55:30] body around the world he has a right to
[55:33] fill his people with the Holy Ghost the
[55:36] lamb has a right to have a group of
[55:39] people on the Earth that he can prove
[55:41] that he's the same yesterday today and
[55:44] forever to prove that he wants to heal
[55:46] the sick and cleanse the leper and raise
[55:49] the dead and cast out Devils y'all going
[55:52] to say Amen with me that's the land L's
[55:55] rights then it's our
[55:57] responsibility to protect the lamb and
[56:00] say you know what we as his people are
[56:03] going to protect the Lamb's rights to
[56:05] have that in so much that we're going to
[56:08] give him our bodies to prove it through
[56:11] us now am I here to convince everybody
[56:15] in the Tri Cities area I am not am I
[56:18] here am I going to go to Every Church in
[56:20] the Tri Cities and try to convince them
[56:22] we're right nope I'm here to get those
[56:25] that God wants us to reach now there may
[56:28] not be but one more in this city that
[56:30] maybe we're supposed to reach there
[56:32] might be 500 there might be 5,000 I
[56:35] don't know how many they're going to be
[56:36] but I pray weekly that God will let us
[56:39] run across their paths so that they can
[56:42] be born of the spirit of God and we can
[56:45] get ready to leave this hell hole cuz I
[56:48] don't know about you I'm getting more
[56:49] sick of this place every day every day
[56:52] it's a more unfit place for for us as
[56:55] the people of God to live in but until
[56:58] that hour arrives I plan on tormenting
[57:01] the devil every day that I'm
[57:04] [Applause]
[57:07] here now notice how how the
[57:11] prophet divides his Earthly strength
[57:15] from his Heavenly strength who would
[57:19] ever thought the Lord Jesus would have
[57:22] wanted Earthly strengths
[57:25] but remember now he's going to build a
[57:27] church and this church is going to be
[57:30] the conveyance by which he will
[57:32] demonstrate his Earthly strength so it's
[57:35] very important to him that they have
[57:38] strength on the earth and that strength
[57:40] will never be recognized by the world
[57:42] but notice he said what is it his
[57:45] Earthly strength God's Earthly strength
[57:48] is his word made flesh so listen
[57:52] carefully now God's Earthly strength is
[57:55] not just us passing out Bibles and we do
[57:58] that we have printed thousands of Bibles
[58:02] around the world you don't realize it
[58:05] but you have helped put Bibles in the
[58:07] hands of many many people that never
[58:11] even owned one you have helped print
[58:14] thousands of seal books you have helped
[58:17] print thousands of Christ the mystery
[58:20] and token and all kinds of books and put
[58:23] it into the hands of Believers but we
[58:26] want more than just printing them books
[58:30] and putting them in their hands we want
[58:32] the context of those books to be made
[58:36] manifest in their lives cuz notice this
[58:39] same Prophet that we're printing his
[58:41] message does not say just passing the
[58:45] books out and passing the tapes out is
[58:48] his Earthly strength but it's when
[58:51] what's on those books and what's on
[58:54] those texes
[58:55] becomes made flesh in those Believers
[58:59] that's when it gains its
[59:02] strength oh praise the Lord aren't you
[59:04] glad you realize that so the Earthly
[59:07] strength of the Lord Jesus is when the
[59:10] word is made flesh in us how many wants
[59:14] that with all your heart the word made
[59:17] flesh now notice this in page 114
[59:20] paragraph 5 he said this is the law of
[59:24] God God's law is to receive a Vindicated
[59:30] servant Now watch how that leoda wants
[59:35] to undermine this position of God's
[59:38] prophet of the age of course and then
[59:40] the other men of God that come
[59:42] underneath the teaching of that same
[59:45] Ministry in order to talk to people into
[59:49] breaking this law of God now Satan knows
[59:53] he cannot make make you do anything he
[59:56] knows that he cannot overpower you he
[1:00:00] does not have enough power to make you
[1:00:02] do one thing you don't want to do he
[1:00:05] knows that we still don't believe that I
[1:00:08] don't think I think we almost make the
[1:00:10] devil like God that he's got all this
[1:00:13] power and he can make me do this and he
[1:00:15] can make me do that he's lying to you he
[1:00:18] cannot make you do anything you don't
[1:00:21] want to do if you don't want to do what
[1:00:24] he want you to do then tell him no and
[1:00:27] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:00:30] you you don't have to mind him your goal
[1:00:34] is to mind Jesus Christ not the
[1:00:39] devil oh my now listen this is a law of
[1:00:44] God God's law is to receive a Vindicated
[1:00:48] servant now the prophet then reads St
[1:00:50] John 13:20 verily verily I say unto you
[1:00:54] he that receives whosoever I send
[1:00:58] receives me but now notice again the
[1:01:00] home group things and lot of things that
[1:01:03] people are doing there's no one servant
[1:01:06] that's there they all become you know
[1:01:08] just sort of like Quakers that's where
[1:01:10] the Quakers did you know years ago they
[1:01:12] really didn't have a pastor in the sense
[1:01:14] that a pastor got up and preached and
[1:01:16] y'all familiar with the Quaker religion
[1:01:18] well what they do they'd gather together
[1:01:20] in the building and the preacher
[1:01:21] wouldn't just necessarily get up and
[1:01:23] preach every service but they just kind
[1:01:25] of gather they may sat there preacher
[1:01:27] don't get on the platform but they just
[1:01:29] kind of sat around and hum and sing a
[1:01:31] little bit and just see who's got
[1:01:33] something to say well you might jump up
[1:01:35] and say something then you might jump up
[1:01:37] then you might jump up you might jump up
[1:01:39] Lord sound like a lot of jumping to me
[1:01:42] but I wonder what said so you see Satan
[1:01:45] knows the law of God is such an
[1:01:49] important thing he wants to try to get
[1:01:52] people who go to church to break this
[1:01:55] law of God and what is the law of God to
[1:01:58] receive a Vindicated servant notice now
[1:02:02] the words of the Lord Jesus Matthew chap
[1:02:05] 10 verse4 whosoever shall not receive
[1:02:09] you nor
[1:02:13] hear now remember the Lord Jesus
[1:02:15] speaking to the disciples they are
[1:02:18] disciples before they are Apostles
[1:02:21] listen carefully to that they are
[1:02:23] disciples
[1:02:25] before they come into the office of
[1:02:28] apostleship but the words of disciples
[1:02:32] before they even get the Holy Ghost were
[1:02:35] so important to the Lord
[1:02:38] Jesus that if you did not receive these
[1:02:42] men you did not receive the Lord Jesus
[1:02:45] himself now this is prior to receiving
[1:02:49] the Holy Ghost Matthew 10 this is when
[1:02:51] he sends them out two by two so if it
[1:02:54] was that emphatic and that powerful and
[1:02:58] it was the law of God existing already
[1:03:00] prior to the Holy Ghost receiving then
[1:03:03] how much more is it after these men
[1:03:06] receive the Holy Ghost now this is the
[1:03:09] order of Jesus Christ Church now how
[1:03:12] many churches are built on this order
[1:03:14] come on
[1:03:16] now praise the Lord whosoever shall not
[1:03:20] receive you nor hear your words when you
[1:03:24] part out of thy
[1:03:26] house or city shake off the dust of your
[1:03:32] feet verily I say unto you it shall be
[1:03:35] more
[1:03:38] tolerable come on now for the land of
[1:03:41] Sodom and
[1:03:44] gomorah now I want you to think of what
[1:03:47] the Lord Jesus is comparing people that
[1:03:51] refuse anointed men of God to
[1:03:56] there will be more grace given to a
[1:03:59] bunch of perverted
[1:04:03] sodomites that it would be a religious
[1:04:05] group of people that turned down God's
[1:04:08] Vindicated servants
[1:04:11] amen now I debate with that you ain't
[1:04:14] got no right to debate with it the Lord
[1:04:16] Jesus said it I didn't say that some
[1:04:20] some other man didn't say it the Lord
[1:04:22] Jesus said it
[1:04:24] now remember these men didn't even have
[1:04:27] the Holy Ghost yet so they were given
[1:04:30] the anointing and remember the the word
[1:04:33] exusia but also the power says two
[1:04:36] different things so one is a
[1:04:37] jurisdiction or a power that is given to
[1:04:41] them by representation which is what
[1:04:43] they're operating under but it's not uh
[1:04:46] something generating from within their
[1:04:48] soul that did not come to the day of
[1:04:50] Pentecost but they were so administering
[1:04:54] as an ambassador look at what they were
[1:04:56] representing so they were an ambassador
[1:04:59] now remember when America or the rest of
[1:05:01] the nations of the world send an
[1:05:03] ambassador and say we send one and we
[1:05:06] send him to Israel we send him to Jordan
[1:05:08] we send him to Saudi Arabia Qatar we
[1:05:11] send him all around the world and though
[1:05:13] he may be a small man in stature he may
[1:05:16] be a little bitty guy his nose might be
[1:05:18] crooked his ear one ear flop down like
[1:05:21] this and the other and stick back like
[1:05:22] that his teeth may be as crooked as a
[1:05:24] dog's High leg he may not have much of a
[1:05:27] be able to talk and this and that and
[1:05:29] other but every missile we've got is
[1:05:32] behind that man every grenade every tank
[1:05:36] every man in the Army the Navy come on
[1:05:39] Saints the air force that man and if
[1:05:42] they was to kidnap that man then every
[1:05:45] American citizen is standing behind him
[1:05:48] now that's the way we look at it as a
[1:05:51] nation what about God on
[1:05:55] can you imagine those seven stars in the
[1:05:59] right hand of the Lord Jesus sir and
[1:06:03] some of these little two before
[1:06:06] preachers that want to take that Prophet
[1:06:10] out of that
[1:06:12] position and place thems in there are
[1:06:15] you
[1:06:22] insane brother Spencer is a great man
[1:06:25] he's probably listening to me now
[1:06:27] brother Tim's a great man I can see that
[1:06:29] million dooll smile in Ron's face now
[1:06:30] he's just looking over sister Connie
[1:06:33] brother Tim's a great man other great
[1:06:35] men around the message but they was none
[1:06:37] of them that was in the right hand of
[1:06:39] Jesus Donnie Reagan Boney I ain't never
[1:06:43] stood in the right hand of Jesus there
[1:06:45] ain't not not another message preacher
[1:06:48] that ever was there but our church AE
[1:06:51] messenger stood there so to reject that
[1:06:55] Prophet do people understand what
[1:06:57] they're
[1:07:00] doing brother D you trying to scare
[1:07:02] people only telling you the
[1:07:06] truth if I can scare you in somebody
[1:07:08] else can scare you
[1:07:11] out now notice verily verse 15 I say
[1:07:15] unto you it shall be more tolerable for
[1:07:17] the land of Sodom and gamor in that day
[1:07:21] of judgment than for that
[1:07:25] City verse 40 he that receiveth
[1:07:34] you receiveth me and he that receiveth
[1:07:38] me receiveth him that sent me so he that
[1:07:42] treats you kindly he that actually
[1:07:46] receive notice now here Jesus doesn't
[1:07:48] even go on to say your doctrines your
[1:07:50] correct formula of baptism but they
[1:07:53] receive you you the person of these God
[1:07:56] call men look at how the Lord looks at
[1:08:00] this law of God when it's enacted so if
[1:08:03] the people of God receive an anointed
[1:08:06] servant of God the Lord Jesus looks at
[1:08:09] that as if though they are receiving
[1:08:13] him
[1:08:15] amen you can imagine then how it is when
[1:08:18] the people turn away that
[1:08:22] servant oh my my goodness he that
[1:08:25] receiveth you receiveth me so they treat
[1:08:29] you kindly you know Jesus saying they're
[1:08:32] receiving me and I will consider that
[1:08:36] kindness as if you did it to me
[1:08:41] personally all right now let's turn it
[1:08:43] around then so what if they refuse that
[1:08:48] servant what about those that want to
[1:08:51] say our Prophet messenger well was a
[1:08:54] false prophet they're calling the Lord
[1:08:57] Jesus
[1:08:58] himself false by
[1:09:01] identification with the
[1:09:03] office then those that would choose a
[1:09:06] false teacher over a true anointed
[1:09:10] servant of God and it's always been
[1:09:13] people's always done it but they don't
[1:09:15] recognize and when we stand before the
[1:09:17] Lord that day and all their lives is
[1:09:19] going to be projected on a screen as it
[1:09:21] were and there will be the very moment
[1:09:25] that they walked out from under the
[1:09:27] administration of John of Paul of
[1:09:30] Timothy of Titus of Luther of Wesley of
[1:09:33] Pentecost of Elijah and every other man
[1:09:36] of God that they forsook and then they
[1:09:38] joined themsel up with some other man
[1:09:40] that claimed to be a prophet as someone
[1:09:44] a preacher friend of mine had called me
[1:09:45] last night and was telling me of of a
[1:09:47] certain video that someone had sent him
[1:09:50] in another country many many thousands
[1:09:51] of miles away from here and the the
[1:09:53] preacher was standing up and telling
[1:09:55] them a message preacher so-called
[1:09:57] standing up and telling the people that
[1:10:00] he was the
[1:10:01] Fulfillment of Revelation 81 that he was
[1:10:05] they had gone beyond Revelation 10:7
[1:10:09] that gone beyond the seventh angel
[1:10:12] messenger and that he was now that great
[1:10:15] fulfilling of the brother Tomy brother
[1:10:17] Donnie he said there in that clip I saw
[1:10:19] look like thousands of people as they
[1:10:23] were screaming and hollering and almost
[1:10:27] like making an obeisance and a
[1:10:31] worship to this
[1:10:36] man I don't have a problem in believing
[1:10:39] that since I stood at that church in
[1:10:42] that church several years ago and
[1:10:44] preached and saw the spirit that was
[1:10:47] there you see to turn
[1:10:50] away from True anointed men of
[1:10:55] God how God looks at it as
[1:11:02] personal he looks at it as as
[1:11:07] personal that's what he says himself for
[1:11:09] and that's not my words notice Jesus
[1:11:12] goes on to say now let me say this
[1:11:15] before we leave this that do you
[1:11:17] understand that you have the
[1:11:21] opportunity every day
[1:11:25] to do something
[1:11:28] kind nice
[1:11:31] thoughtful to the Lord Jesus
[1:11:38] himself
[1:11:41] on when you've done this to the least of
[1:11:43] these my brethren you've done it unto me
[1:11:47] he
[1:11:48] says that ain't just
[1:11:51] preachers how many of y'all would buy
[1:11:53] Jes Jesus a pair of shoes if he needed
[1:11:56] them pair of
[1:11:58] clothes what about if Jesus was hungry
[1:12:02] would y'all buy him something to
[1:12:04] deep Jesus needed a place to live would
[1:12:07] you buy him a house he never owned one
[1:12:09] when he was here the first
[1:12:10] time would we have built Jesus a house
[1:12:13] we Liv in here and then that day and we
[1:12:15] had the finances to do it would we would
[1:12:17] we build him a house we would well I
[1:12:20] wouldn't live him then but by his Grace
[1:12:24] we have been allowed to build him houses
[1:12:28] all over this world for he and his
[1:12:32] children can gather
[1:12:35] together amen and there meet and worship
[1:12:39] and pray and hear his word oh glory to
[1:12:43] God I can't wait for that day to
[1:12:47] arrive when you walk before
[1:12:51] him and he will say
[1:12:54] thank
[1:12:55] you and you'll say for what
[1:12:58] Lord you built this church you done this
[1:13:01] you what Lord we didn't know nothing
[1:13:04] about that we didn't know nothing about
[1:13:07] that when you done it to the least of
[1:13:09] these my brothers you done it to
[1:13:13] me notice in verse
[1:13:15] 41 he that receive us a prophet now wait
[1:13:19] a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoaa whoa
[1:13:21] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:13:23] whoa whoa
[1:13:24] I thought all the prophets them
[1:13:26] dispensation ended in the Old Testament
[1:13:30] and yet Jesus is still referring to it
[1:13:33] as if though there's going to be more
[1:13:35] prophets in the
[1:13:37] future instead of HE that received past
[1:13:40] tense and oh yeah that won't be no more
[1:13:43] no Jesus knew there's going to be more
[1:13:44] in the New
[1:13:46] Testament he that receiveth a prophet in
[1:13:51] the
[1:13:52] name of a
[1:13:56] prophet so he that receiveth a prophet
[1:14:00] in the name of a
[1:14:04] prophet now notice what he's going to
[1:14:07] get shall
[1:14:09] receive a
[1:14:11] prophet's
[1:14:14] reward I love it when somebody was in
[1:14:17] 1964 in question answers whenever they
[1:14:19] asked brother brandham about the
[1:14:22] scripture and he said
[1:14:24] 'w what that means is you can be a
[1:14:28] friend to the
[1:14:29] prophet it might come in handy
[1:14:33] sometime
[1:14:37] amen well I was not allowed and most of
[1:14:40] you were not there's still a few here
[1:14:42] that was able to see brother
[1:14:44] brandom but most of us were not allowed
[1:14:47] to be there but still yet we can still
[1:14:50] receive the prophet's message
[1:14:54] and part of the benefit that we will get
[1:14:57] is not just being so much a personal
[1:15:02] friend but being able to have under that
[1:15:06] influence the true
[1:15:08] interpretation of the word of God for
[1:15:10] the age that we live
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:14] in so the prophet receives the hidden
[1:15:17] man according to the Book of Revelation
[1:15:19] and he has a little special inspiration
[1:15:22] from the Pres of God and then God gives
[1:15:25] that inspiration to the prophet and then
[1:15:27] we that are friends of the Prophet I
[1:15:31] don't mind telling you children I'm glad
[1:15:33] to be a friend of this message I know a
[1:15:36] lot of folks have turned enemies against
[1:15:38] it and there's going to be more as we go
[1:15:41] along and it's going to break our hearts
[1:15:43] as we go but just get ready for it it's
[1:15:45] got to happen but there's going to be
[1:15:47] folks that are going to be friends of
[1:15:50] this message right up to the end and and
[1:15:53] actually that's what the Rapture is it's
[1:15:56] a gathering of family and
[1:16:02] friends amen Jesus said I have called
[1:16:05] you my friends because you are an
[1:16:10] intimate connection was what I have on
[1:16:13] my heart now notice how Jesus relates
[1:16:17] this thing so he that receiveth a
[1:16:19] prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[1:16:22] receive a prophet reward now want you
[1:16:24] notice now it comes on down he that
[1:16:27] receiveth a righteous man in the name of
[1:16:31] a righteous man shall receive a
[1:16:35] righteous man's reward now Jesus doesn't
[1:16:38] say it here but he goes on later and
[1:16:40] Matthew and said he that receives them
[1:16:42] one of the least of these or does
[1:16:43] something to the least so it starts with
[1:16:45] a prophet and then a great righteous man
[1:16:48] then he comes right on down to the least
[1:16:49] which is me and probably most of you but
[1:16:51] we're still covered in in the blanket
[1:16:54] coverage so you see whenever the Lord
[1:16:57] Jesus is now looking at what what are we
[1:16:59] talking about the government we're
[1:17:01] talking about the government will I ever
[1:17:04] have a position not brother random Lord
[1:17:06] no I I don't want that kind of position
[1:17:08] I'm not called to that kind of a
[1:17:10] position I'm not called to have a
[1:17:12] position like a lot of Great Men but I
[1:17:14] do have a position and I want to be
[1:17:17] faithful to what I'm called to do how
[1:17:19] many wants to be and those that receive
[1:17:23] the Servants of God under the law of God
[1:17:27] it will pay off for
[1:17:29] you
[1:17:31] sir as a matter of fact it may not be
[1:17:34] too much longer the way all the signs of
[1:17:37] the times and stuff are looking that
[1:17:39] you're going to get a real reward it'll
[1:17:42] be a prophet's reward a righteous man's
[1:17:45] reward an obedient reward it's going to
[1:17:49] be Award of the ultimate you're going to
[1:17:51] get your body changed huh oh my
[1:17:56] Hallelujah notice Jesus again in Luke
[1:17:59] 10: 16 he that heareth
[1:18:05] you
[1:18:07] wow Hearth
[1:18:10] me he that
[1:18:13] despises
[1:18:17] you friends I I don't I don't I don't
[1:18:19] think that we we take this
[1:18:24] at face
[1:18:27] value but brother Donnie you make so
[1:18:29] many mistakes and and brother brenon was
[1:18:31] a human and he had that human element
[1:18:32] there and and and Paul had that human
[1:18:34] element and Peter had it yeah you're
[1:18:37] right just like every Ambassador we've
[1:18:39] ever had in the United
[1:18:43] States so it's not the humanity it's not
[1:18:46] the human mistakes it's what they
[1:18:49] represent and what they're trying to do
[1:18:51] with all of their heart so if there's
[1:18:53] any person here tonight that's free from
[1:18:55] mistake please
[1:18:58] stand I was hoping the one going to be
[1:19:00] nobody dumb enough to do this I'm fixing

[1:20:02] teachers oh my goodness oh it you just
[1:20:06] you wouldn't hardly believe
[1:20:08] it but you can you can imagine in your
[1:20:12] mind how the five-fold ministry is so
[1:20:16] criticized
[1:20:18] ridiculed and made fun
[1:20:20] of by those who identified themsel as

[1:20:39] not all of them but I've heard many of
[1:20:41] them through the
[1:20:43] years and to realize one day they're
[1:20:45] going to walk before the Lord Jesus and
[1:20:48] he's going to look at them and say why

[1:20:51] pastors

[1:20:57] made fun of
[1:20:58] them and you said well why in the world

[1:40:39] mama it's getting Li in here the

[1:40:52] Darkness had sent his Angelic poers and
[1:40:55] pull that boy into a world of Darkness
[1:40:57] but God had an ambassador of
[1:41:01] light you remember a couple of years
[1:41:03] later when he's going down through the
[1:41:04] train station he's going up there and
[1:41:06] there he said some little red cap come
[1:41:08] on say p and BR him p and BR him he said
[1:41:12] the meals on that train was so high he
[1:41:14] got off the train he said to get him

[1:41:43] the Holy Ghost I'm a right to the
[1:41:45] kingdom of God and eyes got a need
[1:41:47] tonight too Lord eyes got a need tonight
[1:41:52] [Applause]
[1:41:57] you see if a man or
[1:41:59] woman receives a man of
[1:42:03] God he's receiving God's
[1:42:07] representative and
[1:42:09] God's
[1:42:13] Ambassador you see often
[1:42:16] opposition to a
[1:42:18] pastor or an evangelist
[1:42:22] or especially a
[1:42:24] prophet actually
[1:42:26] shows people's opposition to
[1:42:32] God oh they don't think it's that way
[1:42:35] they think it's that
[1:42:38] man but it's actually their opposition
[1:42:41] to God's government on the
[1:42:48] earth oh I'm wonder if it would be
[1:42:54] possible while we're in his
[1:42:59] presence we could be able to open our
[1:43:01] hearts
[1:43:03] tonight there several
[1:43:05] ambassadors of the king in this
[1:43:10] building I don't mean that an ambassador
[1:43:12] is more of a that man that was there was
[1:43:15] no more than American than any other
[1:43:17] farmer or whatever in America but it was
[1:43:21] his
[1:43:26] position his
[1:43:29] position let me read you this in
[1:43:31] discernment of spirit 1960 knowing
[1:43:33] surely that in the day of judgment we
[1:43:35] will be brought face to face with this
[1:43:37] generation and being
[1:43:40] ministers we will be
[1:43:43] judges and the people to which we have
[1:43:46] spoken to and their attitude toward the
[1:43:49] word
[1:43:51] that we bring them will
[1:43:55] determine their
[1:43:58] Eternal
[1:44:00] destination friends you see how serious
[1:44:03] this
[1:44:05] is when a man of God is bringing you the
[1:44:08] word do you understand how serious that
[1:44:12] is I'm not talking about his opinion I
[1:44:14] think I feel I believe I'm talking about
[1:44:16] bringing you the word of
[1:44:19] God and the people to which we have
[1:44:22] spoken to and their attitudes toward the
[1:44:24] word that we bring them will determine
[1:44:26] their Eternal destination now he's
[1:44:28] praying this to God therefore Lord in
[1:44:30] that day we will be a judge for or
[1:44:35] against the
[1:44:38] generation that we preach
[1:44:41] to do you understand that I will stand
[1:44:44] in the day of
[1:44:46] judgment against those who have sat in
[1:44:48] our church and turned their back on this
[1:44:51] message and walked
[1:44:54] away I along with others will stand
[1:44:56] there and be a witness against them as
[1:44:58] so you
[1:45:03] will but what if you've been
[1:45:06] true what if you've been
[1:45:09] faithful and I turn around and I go to
[1:45:12] walking before
[1:45:15] him and I turn around this way and look
[1:45:19] and there you are
[1:45:23] are let me turn around and be able to
[1:45:27] say come on
[1:45:30] children come

[1:54:38] Deliverance whatever you need the king
[1:54:42] is
[1:54:43] here and I am only one of his
[1:54:47] ambassadors but I do know this I do
[1:54:51] represent the greatest King that has
[1:54:54] ever been on the earth and I represent a
[1:54:56] kingdom unlike Napoleon which would come
[1:54:58] to an end unlike the kings and queens of
[1:55:01] the earth that will come to the end I
[1:55:03] represent a king whose kingdom was
[1:55:06] before the foundation of the world and
[1:55:08] will never be
[1:55:12] destroyed you love him with all your
[1:55:17] hearts so do we want to obey the law of
[1:55:23] God don't just come to church expecting
[1:55:25] to hear a
[1:55:27] man but brother Donnie ever preacher I
[1:55:30] ever heard had mistakes yeah I
[1:55:33] know remember brother Fred was texting
[1:55:36] back and forth the other day many him
[1:55:37] have good conversation back and forth
[1:55:39] about the word he was talking about
[1:55:41] nature seeing God in nature and send me
[1:55:43] a bunch of quotes beautiful
[1:55:45] quotes you know brother BR said you can
[1:55:47] see God in nature but you know what I
[1:55:50] also see in nature
[1:55:53] deaths I see freezing temperatures
[1:55:57] plants being killed people having wrecks
[1:56:00] on slick
[1:56:02] roads so I see God in human beings but
[1:56:06] what do I see in nature I see God using
[1:56:09] a flawed nature look out here at our
[1:56:12] beautiful mountains why a that beauty
[1:56:14] y'all think they're beautiful now you
[1:56:15] need to get your eyes checked they're at
[1:56:17] their ugliest stage right now but we
[1:56:20] know it won't be long Buffalo Mountain
[1:56:22] will be beautiful again there'll be
[1:56:23] another spring is that right but we
[1:56:26] still believe God is in his nature do we
[1:56:29] not so we look at one another and
[1:56:32] sometimes our flesh and it's hard for us
[1:56:33] to see God through our old stinking
[1:56:36] Humanity but if you can see God in
[1:56:38] wintertime and you can see God in storms
[1:56:41] and you can see God in lightning and you
[1:56:43] can hear God in the Thunder and you can
[1:56:45] see God with the Earth tilted over on
[1:56:47] its axis then surely we should be able
[1:56:49] to see see God and flawed Humanity God
[1:56:52] speaking through a preacher God using a
[1:56:54] flawed song leader a flawed piano player
[1:56:57] a flawed organ player a flawed bunch of
[1:56:59] people sitting in the pews flawed
[1:57:01] deacons flawed trustees flawed flawed
[1:57:04] flawed Lord Lord
[1:57:06] Lord but God manifesting himself in a
[1:57:10] flawed
[1:57:12] humanity and doing things through them
[1:57:14] flawed humans he could never do through
[1:57:17] sinless holy
[1:57:20] purified
[1:57:24] Angels do you understand when brother
[1:57:26] Daryl Ward stands Before the Throne of
[1:57:29] God God will say things about that Son
[1:57:33] of God that he could never say about the
[1:57:36] greatest
[1:57:38] Archangel the greatest cherubim
[1:57:42] soon men of God that's travel brother
[1:57:44] Jackie bent when he stands there he
[1:57:46] can't travel hardly no more but when he
[1:57:48] stands there and all the souls or R
[1:57:51] behind brother Jack all the trips that
[1:57:53] he's made to the Philippines and up in
[1:57:55] them jungles and all them saints stand

[1:58:11] life and God will reward our brother
[1:58:14] Jackie Benton with the reward and the
[1:58:16] cherums will stand there just
[1:58:21] cuz God chooses flaw things to do his
[1:58:26] greatest work
[1:58:29] with that gives me
[1:58:32] hope that gives us hope don't Brother G
[1:58:35] don't it brother Jonathan don't it
[1:58:38] Carol don't it brother Melvin bless skip
[1:58:41] don't it give us
[1:58:43] hope
[1:58:45] Hallelujah
[1:58:48] SP
[1:58:52] praise the
[1:58:57] Lord
[1:59:00] hallelujah but brother Donnie what if
[1:59:02] you ever leave the word and can't be
[1:59:05] corrected that's
[1:59:07] simple the prophet said you follow your
[1:59:09] pastor till he leaves the word the man
[1:59:12] leaves the word you leave the
[1:59:15] man what's hard about
[1:59:18] that come on Saints amen if brother
[1:59:21] Brandon would have left the word we
[1:59:23] would have left
[1:59:25] him Paul said follow me as I follow
[1:59:29] Christ and the Saints in that age never
[1:59:32] found where he ever left the word even
[1:59:35] though some of the things that he said
[1:59:37] they couldn't find nobody else that said
[1:59:39] them yeah but unlike some of the smart
[1:59:42] atct theologians around the message who
[1:59:45] think they know more about it than our
[1:59:47] Prophet
[1:59:48] messenger
[1:59:49] you know friends I'm convinced a lot of
[1:59:51] the folks have said they believe this
[1:59:53] message don't really put the prophet of
[1:59:55] God of our age on the same level as
[1:59:58] prophets of other age they simply take
[2:00:01] his teaching as some kind of you know
[2:00:04] Bible study and well I I I take that and
[2:00:07] I take that and where you going to stand
[2:00:09] when you stand before God that day
[2:00:12] there's a difference in a prophet saying
[2:00:14] thus sayeth the Lord and a prophet's
[2:00:18] teaching he is
[2:00:20] teaching we not only have thus sayith
[2:00:22] the Lords in this message but we have
[2:00:25] the teachings of the message The Ten
[2:00:29] Commandments were the only ones that God
[2:00:32] wrote by his own
[2:00:34] finger the rest of them Moses wrote by
[2:00:39] inspiration were they not as
[2:00:42] inspired so what if the people said well
[2:00:44] I'm only taking them 10 I don't want the
[2:00:47] rest of
[2:00:48] them come on
[2:00:51] somebody if it comes right down to it
[2:00:53] I'll take the prophet's word over yours
[2:00:55] or mine or anybody
[2:00:59] else's come on
[2:01:01] somebody oh
[2:01:03] my I me want your heart open to the Lord
[2:01:06] tonight look friends let's receive God's
[2:01:10] word the devil's going to do everything
[2:01:13] he can to question The credibility of
[2:01:16] this Prophet messenger before us
[2:01:19] why if he questions his credibility then
[2:01:22] what he had to say is
[2:01:25] worthless if you cannot trust a man I
[2:01:28] don't care what he says and what he does
[2:01:30] if you can't trust him what difference
[2:01:32] does it make that's why Satan is on the
[2:01:36] Rampage to try to make us as the
[2:01:39] followers of this word question The
[2:01:42] credibility of this message well I don't
[2:01:45] know about you he's come too late for
[2:01:47] me praise the the Lord I done burn all
[2:01:50] my bridges and blow them up ain't no way
[2:01:53] back why in the world when I want to go
[2:01:55] back to Pentecost why in the world would
[2:01:56] some of y'all want to go back to baptist
[2:01:58] come on now and I don't want to go back
[2:02:00] to a message version of baptism or a
[2:02:03] message version of Pentecostalism I've
[2:02:05] done been there and seen what that
[2:02:08] produced be no turning back for
[2:02:12] me praise God let's bow our heads if you
[2:02:17] would
[2:02:22] Lord
[2:02:23] Jesus as we bow our heads to the dust of
[2:02:26] the Earth tonight from whence we were
[2:02:31] taken this is one of the sad parts of
[2:02:33] being a
[2:02:35] preacher I realize that I will stand
[2:02:38] that day and give an account of what
[2:02:39] I've said
[2:02:42] tonight I know there's people that
[2:02:44] stream our services and some that
[2:02:46] archive them and they go back on only to
[2:02:49] try to find fault and trying to see what
[2:02:52] they can
[2:02:54] find I feel sorry for them
[2:02:56] Lord because instead of hearing the
[2:02:59] truth and trying to hear correction
[2:03:01] they're looking for mistakes no doubt I
[2:03:03] give them a bunch
[2:03:05] tonight cuz I ain't never preached a
[2:03:08] perfect
[2:03:09] sermon been preaching nearly 40 years
[2:03:13] and I've never preached one perfect
[2:03:16] sermon I've preached thousands of them
[2:03:19] to tens of thousands of people around
[2:03:21] the world and I've never had a perfect
[2:03:24] one they've been flawed and I've
[2:03:26] misquoted things or missaid things not
[2:03:29] intentionally just the human
[2:03:32] element just like to do the profit they
[2:03:34] look for mistakes and look for errors
[2:03:38] spend years of their life trying to find
[2:03:41] well he said right here this so many
[2:03:43] people there and over here he said
[2:03:44] something else see he's a liar no it
[2:03:47] means he's a human being like like all
[2:03:49] the rest of
[2:03:50] us I wonder how many of us tell our
[2:03:53] stories and how they changed over the
[2:03:55] years and we remember them happening a
[2:03:57] certain way when we was 10 years old and
[2:04:00] if somebody videoed that story we're
[2:04:02] telling it 10 and would show it back to
[2:04:04] us at 50 we'd say that video is a lie
[2:04:08] there ain't no way that's a truth
[2:04:10] because we committed it to memory wrong
[2:04:13] and when we recall it we recall it in
[2:04:16] the wrong way and we tell over and over
[2:04:20] and over
[2:04:22] again and we would absolutely die that
[2:04:25] it was the
[2:04:26] fact I didn't want you base your word on
[2:04:29] Lord you don't base it on the recall of
[2:04:32] men Matthew says there was two Blind Men
[2:04:36] there the other writer says there was
[2:04:38] one the four accounts of the gospels
[2:04:41] recording the very same incident one
[2:04:45] says it was a purple robe the other one
[2:04:47] says it was a scarf which is it's not
[2:04:49] the same color at
[2:04:52] all shows how ignorant some of the
[2:04:55] people
[2:04:56] are if they really knew their Bible
[2:04:58] they'd know their Bible was written in
[2:05:00] the same way to Blind the mind of the
[2:05:04] wise and
[2:05:06] prudent we don't want just the verses we
[2:05:10] don't want just the chapters we want the
[2:05:13] author and if the author is living in
[2:05:16] our soul than those things which the
[2:05:18] world points that and says this ain't
[2:05:20] right and that ain't right and that
[2:05:22] ain't right well to us all we see is a
[2:05:26] love letter from our lord Jesus
[2:05:31] Hallelujah Lord God May Carol and I
[2:05:35] always have a
[2:05:36] home where the angels of God can
[2:05:41] visit may I have a walk with you father
[2:05:44] where your spirit can deal with
[2:05:47] me every every day of my
[2:05:50] life I have been one blessed
[2:05:54] man in my walk with you
[2:05:58] Lord there's hardly a week goes by in my
[2:06:01] life and that's happened since I was
[2:06:03] just a boy that I haven't heard from
[2:06:07] Heaven sometimes day after day you'll
[2:06:09] speak to me then you'll go silent for a
[2:06:11] few days and here you'll come again I
[2:06:15] count it such an
[2:06:16] honor to have been able to to hear the
[2:06:19] voice of God throughout my walk with you
[2:06:23] I've been given great
[2:06:26] friends I've been given the ability to
[2:06:30] hear the greatest message that has ever
[2:06:33] swept the
[2:06:35] Earth thank you
[2:06:37] Father I am not ashamed of this message
[2:06:42] nor am I ashamed of this
[2:06:45] Messenger as Paul told Timothy be not
[2:06:48] ashamed of what I say or be not ashamed
[2:06:51] of me so there already must have been an
[2:06:54] element of reproach that was moving in
[2:06:57] the first church age and Paul had to
[2:07:00] remind young Timothy to not be ashamed
[2:07:03] of him no doubt people was critical of
[2:07:06] Timothy quoting a prophet because to
[2:07:10] Timothy it was more than just books it
[2:07:13] wasn't a commentary it was the word of
[2:07:16] the
[2:07:17] Lord no doubt out it was very
[2:07:19] humiliating and
[2:07:21] embarrassing to say well where is your
[2:07:24] Mentor this Paul that you're telling us
[2:07:26] about where is
[2:07:28] he uh he um well um he he he um he he's
[2:07:37] doing a prison
[2:07:39] term he's in
[2:07:41] prison it must have been embarrassing it
[2:07:44] must have been
[2:07:46] humiliating but they didn't look at that
[2:07:48] that they looked at what that man had to
[2:07:52] say Lord God may we as your people look
[2:07:55] Beyond brother Daryl's Frailty brother
[2:07:58] Joel brother Joe Lord these other
[2:08:01] ministers that here at our church Lord
[2:08:04] these young men feeling a pull in their
[2:08:06] hearts may they look Beyond mine as I
[2:08:10] look Beyond theirs may we look beyond
[2:08:12] the humanity of your servants around the
[2:08:15] earth may we look oh God to their
[2:08:19] packing the message of the
[2:08:21] king would it really matter to us if the
[2:08:24] king sent us a message if the messenger
[2:08:27] was to
[2:08:28] stutter or if the messenger didn't have
[2:08:31] the best etiquette and the messenger
[2:08:33] didn't have the best
[2:08:35] ability I don't imagine the gold of my
[2:08:38] ear really mattered to her or that great
[2:08:41] Ambassador was left-handed right-handed
[2:08:45] whether he combed his hair to the left
[2:08:47] or to the right or whether he had one
[2:08:49] hair on his head or not what she was
[2:08:53] interested
[2:08:54] in was his
[2:08:57] authority her country needed
[2:09:00] help and she was going to do everything
[2:09:03] in her power to pull on that man Lord
