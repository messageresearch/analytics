and forever our god reigns yours is a kingdom yours is the glory yours is a name above all names and what a powerful name it is what a powerful name it is the name of jesus christ my king what a powerful name it is nothing can stand against what a powerful name it is the name of jesus what a wonderful name it is the name of jesus what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus praise be to god thank you lord praise the lord jesus hallelujah we're so happy that we can be identified with that precious name many people say that name they use it in cursing they use it in things that's so so reproachable to what a glorious name it is aren't you glad that you not just say it but you're part of it you're part of that name we're greeting tonight in the name of the lord we're so happy we could be together again in the house of god let's turn if you would second timothy chapter three verse one we'll read a few verses here before we pray over the word how many believers are living in the last days you think perilous times are here i believe we can we can all agree to that this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come hard to deal with hard to understand hard to be able to even reckon in life for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away let's bow it together if you would lord jesus we thank you tonight father for the opportunity that we have that we could come together again lord to be able to worship and sing and praise and now of the breaking of your word lord god we bring before you tonight father all of our needs our desires you see lord as we were just talking about in the office before coming out lord there are so many needs among your people so many afflictions and sicknesses and troubles in the homes and lord just everywhere we look when we get down to pray there's so many it's like we can't even remember them all it's like our minds and our memory is just so flooded of trying to recollect everything and lord we are so mindful of our human weakness but lord we realize that no matter if we would bring a million if we could remember that many or write them down or print them out you'd be able to keep every one of them straight you'd be able to send every answer to the right address you'd never get it confused the way we do sometimes and we will call the wrong name was the wrong request but our god is so mighty and so wonderful that millions could come up before you in a moment of time and you keep them all straight so lord jesus we're looking to you tonight father we look around us and we see the darkness it is so penetrating the world that we live we see our nation in the condition that it's in we see the world we see science baffled by one disease after another but yet lord god this hour has not taken you by surprise at all so we're asking you tonight father for your strength for your grace for your healing for your encouragement lord father i hold in my hand tonight these prayer clothes you see lord brother jim bab having a scan in his body and father we're just believing you lord that you're going to let this thing come back good father you see so many of your children facing so many different things but god we just want to lay our needs our requests our desires before your throne tonight god and we're asking you in the name of jesus that your will would be done for every one of them now as we come to the breaking of your word i pray that you'd help me that i can get out of the way that i can just step aside for a few moments as it were to allow you lord to help me to be able to speak those things which are needful which will bring strength stability courage to our hearts in this hour speak to us tonight would you father in the name of the lord jesus we ask it and the saints said amen would y'all say that again amen thank you god bless you you may be seated so the way we believe it here you don't have to say a woman after you say amen because actually we're taught what a man believes what what it means amen means so be it so when we say amen it is not a gender thing for us it is not something that we say well if we say amen that we have to say a woman or a transgender or a so-and-so to be able to give everybody equal rights no we're taught better than that so whenever we say amen we know that it means so be it to our prayers aren't you glad tonight that in this crazy mixed up world that we have an absolute that we can tie our souls to now we know that it has been prophesied and spoken for so many years that the end time would come and that people would grope in insanity it was forecast by the prophets of the old testament and certainly was by the prophets of the new and they told us that it would come a time that people like what we've read tonight it would be such a tumult and the darkness would so penetrate the minds of people and the governments of the people of the earth and that people wouldn't know which way to go they wouldn't have an answer and even though people have looked at their great governments whether it was a theocracy or a democratic as we have yet and no doubt people have always had confidence in their government thinking well this will be able to stern the times whenever they come and when the waves become in such a tumult oh our great nation will be able to stand but how many of those that believe that are laying beneath the sea tonight or if we could go to the ancient ruins of rome now i've stood there in rome and i've looked at those ancient ruins i've men been to other parts of the world and which great great men were able to rule from and be able to see nothing left of that but just dig down so many feet and find some rocks laying there and maybe a piece of pottery and maybe a certain seal with a great man's name on it and as you stand there and look at that and you think here was a kingdom that they thought would endure for a thousand years and yet all the rulers are gone the people are gone and the only thing that is left to testify that they existed is a rock with this certain man's name on it we could go to babylon which of course you know is the land of iraq and we could go and find just barely a few remnants of what existed as one of the greatest empires of the ancient world we could be able to go to rome and go to greece and find things that alexander the great had conquered and then as his kingdom was divided and went into the different powers of the generals and see how they went to egypt and they went to greece and they went to babylon and see those kingdoms as they were conquered one by one by one and we could go to our founding fathers and see how they come here on the basis of searching for a land that they thought would be a free land that their people might be able to worship and might have the freedom of religion and the freedom of speech and our founding fathers writing the constitution and establishing our rights little did they know little did they know thomas jefferson john quincy adams all of those men would have never believed the things that you and i are facing in this very day to aware that as long as you say what is politically correct the government is behind you but if it's not then guess what you'll start losing some of your rights or to begin on twitter first then facebook will follow then youtube will follow then this one will follow but i got some great encouragement this morning as i was thinking about how that no doubt the left has gained control of the senate and the left has gained control of congress and the left has gained control of the white house and the left has gained control of silicon valley but then i had this encouraging saw but the left has not gained control of the throne and the left has not gained control of the kingdom of god in heaven and the left has not gained control of the kingdom of god which is in the earth and may i go on to say they never will because god hallelujah god is the one who is on the throne and no matter what congress does or senate does or the white house does they will only be allowed to do to the elect of god what god allows them to do and everything they are allowed to do will only bring us closer to the rapture and closer to our body change and i say come lord jesus was anybody echo that sentiment tonight now we know that god in in order to allow these things to happen the prophet makes a very profound statement when he talks to us about this evil age and he said the very reason that this age is even allowed to exist is to prove to satan that there is a people on the earth that are not like eve now think about that that statement it is absolutely overwhelming that the very reason that god allowed it to exist the darkness to become as great as it is even disease to come to such a place that our greatest scientists and doctors become stumped of course now they've got a name for whatever bothers you they blame it all uncovered now it may not be coveted related before they just call it an airborne something another that they wasn't sure but if you wound up with a jerk well it's covered related if you wound up with a big lip and a big fat ear it's covered related don't you believe all that stuff the thing of it is i don't know a bit more now than they did you know many months ago about it all when science ever going to be honest and say they don't have all the answers to all of life's problems but we don't know that our god knew that it would come to this place he also knew it would increase great pressure upon the elect because he knows that the elect even though they are electing their souls that their bodies are still human they can have wonderful churches they can be blessed by god with great ministries they can be even blessed financially live in nice homes drive nice cars but he also knows that the flesh of even the elect tends to get lazy it tends to get to a spot to where we just kind of you know go along and have church and we get into a rhythm but god knows how to turn the pressure up on us in order to make us pray like we've never prayed before he knows how to let things even come in our home or our family or our nation or our church that'll begin to shake people up and say oh my goodness what in the world is going on because there's something about this old rotten body that you and i live in it becomes lazy it becomes complacent did y'all come to have church tonight or what it becomes that way and god knows exactly how to bring us together does he not now we know that this was prophesied uh so many different ways by which it would come and our lord jesus even whenever he was here he forecast of the darkness that would be upon the earth in the last days and it prophesied about the end of the jewish dispensation as we looked at it last wednesday on the three questions that were asked in matthew 24 and you know many theologians down through the years have run those three questions together but jesus was actually answering it in a dispensational way so the first question was asked they asked question one question two question three and jesus asked answered them but many of them have ascertained that he was putting it all together so they tried to put it with the coming of the lord and set a certain date what it's going to be in 1958 well then we come to the message and we put it in 1977 and many you know they try to put it back on years in different times but the lord knows exactly how to answer questions does he not he tells us just enough to let us know of a certain era at a certain time but he does not give us enough information that will encourage our laziness he does not give us enough where he can pinpoint the day or the hour but he will give us seasonal times or he will give us dispensational measures by which we can look at and say okay we must be getting close and you know the unbeliever will look and say oh i've heard people say that for 40 years i've heard people say that since i was a little boy why because god will let many of those things overlap and it would have part of it applied in the days of paul part of the days of loser part of it in the days of wesley but it would be more magnified in the last days but yet for those that are non-elected they would say oh i've heard this all in my life and they say where is the promise of his coming why my goodness when i was a little boy i went to happy valley and i heard brother donnie preaching that 30 years ago and all i see happen is he's got more gray hair and then other people's got more gray hair and they've got older and older and jesus ain't no closer to coming than he was in i beg to differ with you he's much closer now than he was 30 years ago when i first came here because the signs of the time though they linger they can go on and on and on is that right now let us go back if we can to this that we was looking at last week and matthew chapter 12 verse 43 you know when the lord jesus would speak he would speak many times of of a compound parable now this is what he's doing about this symbolism here about the unclean spirit and he says it this way when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none i want you to notice how brother branham deals with this he said jesus said when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man did you notice he never said when he's cast out of a man but when he goes out by his own will when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he returns back to this man and finds the house that he lived in has been swept and garnished then he goes and gets seven other devils demons unclean spirits enters into that man and the lies to say to this man is seven times worse than it was at the first did you notice the devil went out of his own will and he returned by his own will now this house had already been occupied when he returned he would have not been able to get in but you see he just found his swept and garnished so here is an individual that has come through a step or steps or process to where they're getting closer and closer to god something has happened to them they feel feel a purging they feel better they feel cleaner people look at their lives and they can definitely see changes in their lives and even satan himself had to take knowledge that something had happened to the light of this individual but it's sort of like if you're looking for an apartment to rent or a house to rent and then you would look down through there and they will put it categorically it will be either in the category of unfinished or furnished rather or furnished now so you look down through there and you have all of your furniture and you want to look under the category i want an apartment that is unfurnished i want it to be empty because i like my table my bed my end tables and this and that but if you don't want to move your furniture and you want to leave it in storage then you look in the category of a furnished apartment basically you move your clothes in and your groceries in and everything else is furnished but whether you look at a furnished one or an unfurnished one it is still empty of an occupant now whenever this devil goes out and the bible doesn't tell us exactly how long he's out but it must have been long enough for the sanctification process following the justification process to take place in the life of this individual but the lord jesus is not just speaking now about a man but he's speaking about a generation and he's speaking about a dispensation once again brother rahm says this and how can i overcome and we notice when the unclean spirit is gone from a man he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done baptist methodists those who believed in sanctification okay so we're not just looking now at a man or a woman a young man or a young woman but this can apply to an organization as well it can apply to a generation it can apply to a church age now watch how that you can take one man and represent a whole generation of people you see john the revelator on the isle of patmos when the angel of god told him to take the book and eat the book john was actually standing there as one man but representing the entire bride as she is to take the word and need him adam in the garden of eden stood there by himself but as he listened to the lie of the devil over the word of god though he was by himself as far as a man but yet he represented every man from that time to the very end watch this those who believed in sanctification then jesus said the unclean spirit went out returns back to this church body now this is what happens in the church ages this is what makes them form an organization when they come out and god burst them under the administration of the church age messenger then that unclean spirit by the word of that day is cast out away from those people and they're free and they come out of catholicism or whatever it was and they say oh my thank god god's moving among us god's alive and god's healing and god's doing this and that so that unclean spit of that denominational thing goes out of them but they don't go far enough to get the new light of the pending age but what they do is make another organization and then when they do they form their ideology their doctrines and when they do then that demon comes back and it says oh my here is an empty house but it's swept and it's garnished look at all this boy they've got church order they've got this and that and the other but you know what he wasn't afraid of all their order he was not afraid of all the things that had taken place in their life but what allowed him to come back in was there was no occupant in the furnished apartment so they've got the bed they've got the dresser it's all full of groceries it's all in order they've got everything that is perfectly ready for an occupant to move in but there's no one living in the apartment notice he said then jesus said the unclean spirit that went out returns back to this church body and finds the house garnish swept clean living pure clean lives pure clean like pure clean lies listen friends just because we think folks are good people good people does not mean they're accepted in the eyes of god the bible does not say the prayer of a good man is what moves god but the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man not a good man you and i look at them oh that's a good man that's a good woman that's a good man you mean that's as far as you know you see you and i may be looking at people and saying oh they are so good and we don't have a clue what they do in the secret time of their life but it's not so much a good man or a good woman as we would call them that god hears their prayers but it is a righteous man or a righteous woman how can they be righteous because they are veiled in the very righteousness of christ the word another point that separates the bride from the church good people that you work with and that you know and they're good people but yet god does not categorize them by just being good and bad he categorizes them by being righteous in christ jesus you see the prophet tells us that the very reason they go through the tribulation period is because they reject the fullness of the word and its atonement to make them clean so they pick out what they want oh boy they're against catholicism you take a good old southern baptist he'll never join up to catholicism he'll never join up to the homosexual agenda my my there ain't no way in the world he'll stand right there praise god but you tell him you get alone in your prayer calls it and go to speak in another language sometime and see how that good man responds then ah then you see an attitude from that good man that goes to ridicule and making fun of your bible so what happens to his goodness praise the lord well say they believe in speaking in tongues and then you tell them about god senator the prophet of malachi 4. see what happens to that good man's attitude or that good woman's attitude so you see it's easy for us to look at people and categorize them well this is a good man that's a good man that's not the way god looks at it god looks at it as them being loosed or separated or washed from their unbelief by receiving the fullness of his word so you know the portions of the word that god reveals to us the difference between elect and non-elect is non-elect will take what they want because the word is like a smorgasbord to them it's like a walk-through buffet so they take this they take that they don't want this they simply don't get it but that's not the way the word works god gives it to us and god expects us to line up now it may take us a week or two or a year or whatever it is but the elect of god will receive every word of god because the word is their father is that right not only that but it is their husband so they're joined to him through this great power of providence which is his truth now other people they can belong to this church and be a good church member boy absolutely a good person and yet they don't believe this they don't believe that they don't believe that in the world that cannot be bride friends that cannot be bribed because the bride will be united totally and completely with the word so notice this individual this church age this generation that jesus is speaking about what's the prophet said that if that house isn't filled occupied then comes seven other evil demons worse than he was and the last stage of this place is seven times worse than it was at the first place they had been better to stay oh my goodness now i realize every time i deal with this message folks get mad at me because i do not believe the message is like ambway i do not believe that the message is a pyramid scheme i do not believe the message is a product that we can just hand out to everybody oh brother donny don't you think we ought to witness i do to those that the king leads you to witness to one of these days you're going to open up your eyes and realize we would have been better off to left some of these lutherans in the lucerne church but instead we tried to sell our product without the leading of the holy ghost and we convinced them with our ability that the message was right they ran it 10 years 15 years 20 years 30 years 40 for some of them and finally they come to who they were and they were sick of sitting in a message church and they turn against it you'd have been better off to left them luther because now many of them have crossed the line and will never be saved it's not a product friends that we can just go throwing here and there and there and there the truth oh my the word of god is not really ours to give it is the spirit of god who uses our instrumentality you say i'm crazy if you want to listen to the very words of your prophet they would have been better to stay looser than it would be to receive the light and to follow it not saying so a man a woman or boy or girl would been better off to stay the lucerne or a methodist or a baptist than they would to be brought to the knowledge of the message and then turn away from it why you say how can that be the more light you see when you walk from it the more grace the more grace you're trampling under your feet notice this in verse 44 then he says i will return into notice he realizes whose house this is my house why the title deed has not been cleared on this person's soul now there may be they may give up drinking they may have given up smoking they don't watch bad movies they don't listen to bad music but that ain't what separates them they're still married to that first nature they've still got that nature in them and this demon out of hell can look at that house and say that's still my house they might be worshiping god they might sing they might play a guitar they might play the piano oh my they might be such a oh good person i will return into my house from whence i notice his authority notice his position had he been cast out by a servant of god he cannot truthfully be saying these things about i and mine and me because he's been made to leave by authority and he cannot come back unless that individual house owner opens up their heart and says come back into me think of it friends and when he has come he findeth it empty to be at leisure to be idle to be unoccupied empty swept to sweep to clean by sweeping and garnish to put in order arrange make ready prepare to ornament adore metaphorically to embellish with honor or gain honor now look at all the work look at all the sermons look at all the prayer and all the things that have went into this individual's life and yet none of that kept that demon out of there notice he findeth it empty swept and garnished oh you know it's it's not enough the way the lord jesus uses these words empty swept and garnished it's more it takes more than that it must be the right tenant that moves into that furnace department and he takes the keys to the door if you're in an apartment from an individual would you want them having a key to all of your house and all of your possessions and everything else god don't want that devil once you leave he leaves out of there to have a key into your joy a key into your happiness a key into this and that and the other and when he does we're letting him rob us but god wants to take that and change the locks amen he wants to change the locks while the devil used to control my joy you need to let the holy ghost change the locks to your joy all the mother don and we're living in terrible times i realize we are terrible times should not have the skeleton key to your joy terrible times should not have the skeleton key to your peace your prayer life common saints it ought to be so given to you by the holy ghost that the spirit of god changed every lock in your house it changed every lock and every avenue of your being and you say satan may affect me but you are not getting in this house get out of here oh man you see this demon is ironically displayed in the way that jesus gives him and renders him as if though he just went for a casual walk so he's gone for a month or two and he walks through dry places now you know to the jews the way that they looked at hebrewism is what it's called that they looked at a desert as being a dwelling place of demons they looked at the number seven the number seven is the spiritual number we know but even in the hebrew way of looking at things the number of seven was a number of magnitudes so whenever jesus used the number of seven it would have really got the attention of those people we know to us god manifests himself in sevens but yet the way that they looked at it all night must have been so overwhelming when jesus now opening up this realm of demonology but when the demon returned what does he do he brings seven other devils that are worse than himself now we know of course that the last days of this man would have been ended in absolute tragedy what's in verse 45 then go as he and take us with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself so showing us that there are degrees of wickedness as there is degrees among spirits whenever god created them they had a hierarchy of course archaeo is the word that was made first and those in the first line so the life state of this man jesus said would be worse oh my what happens they enter notice the plurality now this entrance they enter in and dwell there now they're not going to leave now they're not going to come and go but they set up housekeeping i wonder friends how many that we rub shoulders with that has 8 10 20 15 50 demons in their bodies and this is why when you cross them that certain demon will take their human characteristics and traits and personify them and they become a different person that you don't even know you ever dealt with something like that and then all of a sudden that manifestation will be there for 10 minutes or 15 minutes or less and they revert back to that other person you think what in the world happened to them it was one of the residents that lives inside that body and then another situation would happen totally different from that one and another demon maybe a demon of chimp or whatever more which is right next to insanity wanted to take this individual's body over and according to the stress factor and according to what they're dealing with each demon will take its spot and manifest it or manifest itself to that human body if demons can do that what about the power of the holy ghost and a child of god if a devil can get a hold of a person and change their their way of talking their way of thinking and give them superhuman strength cannot the power of the holy ghost anoint our face anoint our talking anoint our minds anoint our prayer that we may get down to pray and it's just us for the first 15 minutes but all of a sudden the holy ghost comes in there amen and it's not us anymore it's not just us reiterating what we thought we'd talk about but it's him anointing our prayer and them devils out of hell are running scared because they hear the voice of jesus hallelujah and the last state of that man is worse than the first so it becomes more wicked more rotten more corrupt now notice such are the conditions of apostates you see apostasy is worse than ever being unconverted coming to truth and embracing it and walking away is worse than a person that ever that never even got saved it's hard for you to ponder it you see for the most part many of them will never be recovered god now notice these words that jesus adds to this latter part of the verse even shall it be also unto this wicked generation so then the lord jesus takes the focus off of just an individual and he says so will it be even unto this wicked generation and we know him well enough to know these words must have been spoken in sorrow and heaviness it was no doubt from the heart of a loving savior that did not will it to be this way because he knew that as a generation israel would reject him now he's speaking about an individual he's speaking about church ages to come but he's also focusing on that generation of jews now how in the world could we ever take this parabolic form and focus it on them jews well we would have to look at it exactly right now remember on the return of them coming back out of the captivity those of you that have studied jewish history you know that for the most part a lot of the idolatry which they were sold out into into babylon and the different kingdoms once they come back out they never went that direction again when they come out even under the maccabees and they went in to to have the hasmonean war and they want him to try to restore and it seemingly was a revival sort of like luther's day of justification to where it brought a spiritual spark of fire among them and they wanted to worship god so you look and see when they come out that the lord jesus is categorizing israel as a whole like this individual that god done something for them and god brought them a long way but jesus is now standing there with heaviness in his heart and reading to them their very destiny he said i am telling you you generation of jews i'm telling you what is going to happen to you before it ever happens i'm going to tell you you come out from under the babylonian captivity the temple was rebuilt and restored but i'm telling you now you've got all your bonnets and your hats and this and that and the other and you paid ties of mint and rue and coming and you do this and that and the other but you are empty he said your houses are like the graves that throw the bones of them inside of there oh my you know how they were in their day they were so religious and so lost they were so religious and they had everything in such order but they had no occupant oh my no occupant living down inside their soul here now jesus takes it and places it upon that entire generation but let me sound the trumpet to you tonight that was peter which fit in that generation that was john which fit in that generation there was different ones that also heard this same parable but they did not remain in that generation why because they were called out to be in his generation they was pharisees they were sadducees they were of the essenes they were different groups that they had come out of but the lord jesus had called him with his voice light his voice light had struck her soul even though they had not received the holy ghost yet they had been brought out of what they were of what they had believed all of their lives and even though they were born in that generation they did not fit in that generation may i say to you our generation is the generation that will consummate the judgment of god our generation our nation will be that which sums up the very mind the very judgment of god but yet because i'm born in this generation does not mean that i'm numbered with the transgressors hallelujah why because i have been reborn into another generation i am not or in time my body is still layered of sin my body may be layered to sin but my soul is a gene of god in the time frame i'm getting older i'm getting weaker i'm this and that and the other but my soul has eternal life it's not one day older now than it was before the foundation of the world though i am here i do not belong here though i reside here i have another place that i'm going to you see it's up to us they were right there and heard these words they could have said well i guess we're doomed too peter could have looked at john and john looked at james and said they don't need them trying ain't no needing us even trying to do anything if these guys were lost and what about us but they heard another voice from jesus saying all that my father has given me will come amen they heard these words out of jesus mouth too but somehow brother dale i believe when they heard this they thought i mean who i am that don't apply to me i'll tell you one thing friend you and i need to have this within us that whenever we hear somebody talking about a preacher preaching about deceivers and pharaoh and judas and all that and the devil will try to make that you you just straighten him out right there said devil that ain't me i ain't judas i am not a deceiver i am not a hypocrite i'm not a liar i'm a son or daughter of god i may have mistakes but that has nothing to do with me i am of a higher genealogy i am not laodicean i am not going to be lost i am not going to be left behind oh my notice this hebrews 6 4. most of your bible readers are familiar with this for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened you have to be very careful now when the you read this passage that paul did not say those who were once sealed but enlightened which means their eyes come open to an understanding they didn't previously have now they were enlightened and they actually tasted of the heavenly gift singular not gifts so they actually tasted of the holy ghost now a person can taste of it i don't want to just taste it i want to be sealed by it but these people had tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost you see some of them actually had a baptism in their spirit and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come i'm gonna tell you something friends these are not infidels these are not agnostics these have people that are pentecostal in an experience where they've actually tasted these are not people that don't believe in a move of god these are not people that don't even think god can even do that they even know there's more to god than just a confession that there's something about them that they hungered for a little bit more beyond hail mary mother of god pray for our sinners now the time of our departure amen that's not the type of people we're talking about but they had a hunger for the holy ghost so they must have talked about the holy ghost and they got far enough in far enough into the kingdom of god that they even tasted of the holy ghost i said oh oh this is so good thank you lord thank you oh praise god and they tasted the word they didn't just run it in their mind but they pulled the word down oh oh thank you lord that is so good that word oh it's so good i know i know i know this is serious but we're in serious times have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away which is what the word apostate apostasy if they become apostate to what they said what they saw what they ate what they experienced and then they turn and walk away from it to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame so you see jesus speaking to the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the jews that came out of the exile and they were justified by faith we'll say they come on up under the maccabees which is prior to the coming of the lord jesus of course and they had been able to experience a cleansing for he goes into the temple and cleanses a lot of the mythology that had been brought into the temple prior to this is prior to the coming of john the baptist so they experience an element of sanctification so the house is swept it's garnished and here come the king himself and what did he tell them harry except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you what's he offering them himself y'all are clean you're swept you're garnished you've got everything in order i am what you need and they said we will not have this man to rule over us say we not well thou art a samaritan and has to devil so the lord jesus offered to take the keys of their soul keys of their spirit keys of their reasoning their imagine nation their conscience their affection but they said we'll have nothing to do with this man so they reached down and picked up stones whenever he took the book there and opened it up and said this day this scripture is fulfilled before your sight and the bible said they went to plunge him down the cliff their heads long to kill him they also in another place when he was announcer picked up stones to stone him the man that come to take up residence in their furnished apartment but they said we don't want you in our house you're not welcome here so jesus said then your house will be left unto you unoccupied and desolate and i tell you now you will become possessed with more demons and you will be worse than your father was pre-exile you will be worse than the canaanites now think of it friends the canaanites were horrible people horrible some of the practices and things that they did was unbelievable but when you look at the mercy of god that dealt with the children of israel and the way god brought them out god punished the children of israel worse than he did the canaanites why they drunk the nectar of his cup they took from the bread of his table you see the more mercy is given to us when god opens his word to us and gives us a revelation you understand what he's doing he's unveiling a portion of himself to us that is mercy not just mercy when you get saved every time you get a revelation from the throne of god it's a further extension of the personality of god revealed in your life more mercy more mercy mercy about healing mercy about grace mercy about overcoming and when a person turns from each of those steps of revelation he tramples the blood of god the mercy of the almighty god right under foot and so i'm going to go back and be what i was before i come to this message that is totally completely impossible all these folks have left this message will never ever get away from it i'll tell you right now probably more than likely most of them who have turned away never have a week that goes by in their life that they don't think say or something about this message remember truth does one of two things it binds you or sets you free what's so sad many of these that have turned and went away they're bound right at the door of this message they talk about it more now than they ever did they mentioned the name william branham in reproach and repulsively sure but they'll never get free from it add me lord jesus lord god you see even though he left and left them in this state he found a house empty but before he left things started coming in now think of it i mean carol was talking about this week and i told her said you know what must have been something as the scribes the pharisees and many of those religious leaders of that day once the light of jesus shined on them and they turned it down nicodemus said rabbi we know thou art a teacher that cometh from god no man can do these things except god be with him right jesus said if you were blind you would have no sin but because you say we see therefore your sin remains imagine their wives and their families must have been overwhelmed as they saw these leaders changed by the way they got more corrupt more vile they lied they twisted the torah you imagine how surprised at those men on the sanhedrin they were so overwhelmed by the way the religious leaders carried out the trial and crucifixion of the lord jesus because they knew it was absolutely contrary according to the very law that they said they believed it forbid them from having a trial in nighttime and whenever the witnesses would not corroborate their testimony then whatever they was trying to accomplish out of them witnesses then witnesses would have it done to them according to the law the torah and the misha they should have taken them men which lied against the lord jesus and crucified them if they believed what their prophet said but they didn't believe it demons started entering in lying devils corrupt devils political devils lord jesus the most holy people of that day but there they crucified him there the most religious place on the earth they the most religious people on the earth crucified the most painful shameful death that a person can go through him the most lovely most pure hallelujah their day they who they who thought they were the cream of the crop they who believed they were in charge of god sheep oh you imagine as the wars begin to rage you know the prophet if you haven't listened to this oneness of god i'm sure many of you have but if you haven't do you're good to listen to it in there brother branham brings out also on the uniting time and sign especially from the political aspect that the jews had to unite together in order to reject the word christ and when they united against him then titus started uniting his army and he said i believe we're living in a uniting time praise the lord we seem united and don't we we see it right now going on in our nation things that's happened in the last week or two we never thought we'd ever see come on saints and if you voice your opinion about certain things they are united against you to shut you up well praise the lord is that right and it's exactly got to be so why so god will allow communism god will allow russia to unite together and this nation will pay the ultimate price they will run to the mother these prostitute daughters will run and they will join in allegiance together because they don't want to oh my give up their evangelical rights so they will run back to mama and they will join together and they will unite together and when they are in the spirit of united god is going to have a nation that will be raised up and will have the vatican's name wrote on a bomb oh my goodness old but brother donald oh i'm so afraid i'm so afraid don't be afraid you you need to unite yourself you see while they're united and all the left is uniting and the right so-called is uniting and this one's united this is another uniting that is going on and you know what the title of that sermon that he preached in 1963 was uniting time and science everybody's uniting under something what people are looking at they say oh my facebook is doing this and youtube is doing that oh my they shut this guy up well what are they watching they're watching facebook signs and they're watching watching twitter sign well tweet tweet tweet to you too i'm not watching twitter i'm not watching facebook i'm watching the signs right here in his word oh no i'm not uniting with twitter i'm not uniting with facebook i'm uniting what's the word because if they are united what are they doing it for so the atomic powers can begin to unite together in order to wipe them off the face of the earth and annihilate them oh my but don't worry children hallelujah before one of them bombs ever drop praise god you'll be leaving this world praise be to god oh the lord jesus was not invited to occupy this empty sadducee house this empty essene house this empty herodian house this empty pharisee house they would not allow him can't you see people today exactly the same thing they want him to be a savior but stay out of their closet stay out of their music tell them don't tell them what books to read and what movies to watch and what music to listen to you keep that preaching to yourself preacher ain't nobody going to tell me what to do fine i'm going to tell you the requirements if you want to go you'll line up to them and if you don't that choice is entirely up to you what are you doing lord jesus i want you to be my savior but i don't want you to be my husband i don't want to be married to you lord but the bride says lord lord whatever you want i give you every key i give you absolutely every key of my life lord here's the key to my memory there's a key to my conscience here's the key to the music i listen to to the books i read to the places i go to whatever i do lord i give you the key to everything because you know better how to keep house than i do it's evident lord i don't know how to keep house because i i'm a bad housekeeper come on saints if the pharisees could just admit it to imagine nicodemus setting their friend it would have been better for him to have never seen what he saw well brother donnie what about me what about you we have seen god's mercy we have seen god do so many things let's not let it turn against us you see this parable was worded in such a perfect sense to identify that generation imagine they got so angry they got so upset i wonder how many demons entered them when they heard jesus preach the word instead of repenting they got so mad and so angry and when they did they opened their soul right there in that meeting and the demon stepped right inside of their soul you imagine when they went home that evening brother dave after church and they were so mean and so grouchy and so contrary and the wife was saying what's the matter with you are you are you sick and you know i'm fine you're not the way you was this morning where you've been today i've been to church i didn't hear jesus preach and i didn't like it you see friends when we come to the house of god we don't realize there's demons here there's angels are here great angelic powers are warring right in there in this place in that oh i can feel them they war for what occupancy praise god oh i don't look like much i'm certainly not a great preacher but you see none of that is what scares the devils away but it's when they come up to the house and see the sign occupied not for rent nor for sale my height my weight how old i am good preacher not a good preacher good singer not a good singer has absolutely nothing to do with it it's the occupation sign that drives them back now you see i could jump i could shout i could run i could do all of those things that's not the sign that they run from but brother if they see jesus in the driver's seat don't worry demons won't be hitchhiking in your car that's right they're not afraid of me and you they're not afraid of even our knowledge of the word of god but if it's the personality i don't know exactly what they see but i do know from the discernments that i've looked at and what the prophet of god saw than whenever he would see a sinner and he would look at them and say you've got really good faith to not be a christian i see that you're a sinner tonight i see that darkness that's hanging around you or a woman who'd call out and say you're praying for your son your son's got this this and this and you want your daughter's got that and that not only that they're unsaved i see darkness hanging around them and he would identify whether or not they were believers or unbelievers by light or darkness and he looked to another and say i know you feel welcome let me describe how you're feeling it's a real comfortable feeling it's light all around you you are a believer he never said oh let me measure your hair system let me measure your hair brothers uh how long is your skirt how long was your dress uh what church do you go to it was a pulsation from their soul that let him read and let him see in that realm don't you understand that's the same realm that demons were in all my i was doing a study last night on diabetes and i looked at all the quotes that brother branham said about 340 360 something like that and as i began to look at it i saw how that whatever a person would come up with diabetes and then another one begin to scream out on the audience and he would say where was that what happened what what was it where was it he said oh my i'm getting so tired now satan will try to trick you lord help me lord please help me and then he looked around where was that woman where was that woman oh i see there it was oh no she's delivered she's delivered oh that's another one out there everybody in the building just got diabetes stand to your feet right now he said you're healed in the name of jesus christ and he said satan thought he would pull one over satan thought he would do that but what did them dumb devils do they just expose themselves it was a warfare that was going on all the discernment ain't here tonight a prophet is not here to tell us the secrets of our hearts but the sword is going for and devils hate that word and that word is here to set us free that word is here to deliver us of our evils it's here hallelujah to bring healing to our bodies you believe it with all your heart we are not that generation but we are his generation praise be to god praise be to god you imagine they got so bad so bad till their last destruction was total annihilation the blood run out the streets they boil their children and eat them paid to bark off the trees the grass off the ground that would have been bad enough but they died lost titus and camped about the city and they thought oh we're fine we're good we're good they went into the temple and prayed oh great jehovah great father so and so come and pray for us and they run into the temple and they begin to offer sacrifice and they prayed and they went through all of that and while that was going on they was busting down the gates and burning the gates and here was the romans flooding in the city and they killed them and slaughtered them by the thousands but not one believer was found in the city why they heard the words of jesus through his own body and then they heard the words of jesus through his bride body and when they began to see the signs you know what they'd done they packed up their stuff and left before the tribulation period set in america hallelujah they packed up their stuff there was not one believer that had to boil their child there was not one believer that had the tree bark brother they had done fed on the word and that's united with the time and the sign and they was out of there they left it by the grace of god let me read you a couple more scriptures and we'll close watch how paul was dealing now with this thing remember thessalonians written around 6-61 so this is before the last phase of this starts to kick in for you brethren become followers of the churches of god which in judea are in christ jesus for you also have suffered like things ah not of the persians not of the babylonians but of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews the most religious people on the world and now they are setting up a persecution against the elect of god so today they try to do it by facebook and emails and challenge you to this and that and the other persecute you run you down call your names now watch him as he goes on to describe who both killed the lord jesus and their own prophets wouldn't you hate for a prophet of god to write this about you who both killed the lord jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us and they please not god not only that they're contrary to all men they can't get along with nobody by now they have moved into such a state of misery they can't get along with anybody why demons are now inhabiting their bodies you understand what causes wars right from the sermon victory day sir vista 1963 the prophet said what brings wars is because the spirit of france well gets jealous of the spirit of germany and the spirit of germany gets spirit jealous of the spirit of america and then them demons go to fighting and what they do is get under the german influence and the swiss influence and then they bring that manifestation upon the earth and they start firing bullets and fired cannons and all that at one another that's what happens in denominations well i hope you understand what i'm fixing to say that's what's happened to the politics of america there's demons that's in charge of one party and demons that's in charge of another party because remember satan is the king of both sides they can't get along with one another they can't get along among themselves so what do they do they fuss and fight and now they're so split and divided among themselves oh but boy brother donna given enough time biden will bring peace are you that ignorant are american people that ignorant and dumb that covet is going to fly away once biden is anointed are we that dumb are we that blind that we cannot see we are at the end time i don't care who we vote in it is beyond redemption friend don't focus your time and your prayers oh god oh god that bad let trump hear you better say god let me win let me get out of this place lord jesus don't you understand whatever people get into and even believers getting on facebook from what i'm told and fussing and arguing and fighting about politics don't you know what you're doing you're getting under that demonic spirit oh my and they fast and they fight and they argue well what's the answer i'll tell you what the answer is a godly king and in our state state it is king god king theophany king jesus notice what paul said forbidding us to speak ah so they started working on their freedom of speech did they forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved now he doesn't go into the details to describe what they were doing but these evil demon possessed people were trying to stop the apostles from preaching the truth and this is the reason why to fill up their sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost mama and about four years five years later it starts and it goes on from 66 to 67 to 68 to 69 to 70. and then titus rides in and takes it over kills them by the thousands according to some of the historical writings over a million people died died thinking this going to heaven died singing songs to jehovah and you imagine when they opened up their eyes in the regions of the lost and they thought god have mercy what am i doing here because they took on their destiny their deceit their discrepancy and their lives personified well if people start acting like hell before they get to it you and i are to start acting like heaven before we reach ours well to be more and more like the lord jesus but it's harder now brother donny but the power of god is greater you're going to focus on how hard it is you want to focus on how god big how big our god is oh it's dark it's shark that's right i'll agree with you but the light has never been so bright you want me to preach about how dark it is or how light it is oh but there's so much sickness but there's so many miracles happening so much healing that's taking place our god is superior over all the powers of darkness amen let's read this let's stand together second peter chapter 2 verse verse 21 we'll pick it up again lord willing for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness then after notice after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment i want you to notice the way peter writes this the same way paul does they're not turning from something they have in their soul but from something they've been taught a commandment which is something written and they accepted it as a commandment of god and believed it was right and peter says it would have been better for them to have never known it than after they have known the way of righteousness after they have known it to turn away from the holy commandment delivered unto them now can you imagine that god would anoint this man to categorize it in such a way that darkness darkness would have been less a sin than to embrace light and say i see it i see it i see it and then down the road turn away and say that was a bunch of lies that was totally wrong when really inside of their soul they still know it's right lord have mercy children may god help us why brother donny they sinned against more mercy more grace oh my and actually they become more capable of worse sin you see an apostasy and a person that is apostasizer one that is in such a state is actually liable of greater punishment remember brother ben tom had earned baxter whenever he said about paul and whenever he mentioned demas and ernin told brother branham he said brother ma'am you know the first thing i'm gonna do when i get to him and he said what urn he said i'm gonna walk right up to demas and i'm gonna smack him right in the face and say how did you forsake paul down there brother baby said earn i think i'd be careful about wanting to go where demas went now remember he said demas did not go back to the world he was a preacher but he turned his back on the prophet of god and the prophet's message because he started seeing things you may remember the sermon that the lord gave me several years ago on the failure of intellectual faith and the lord had me to bring it in the first person of demas as if i was demas when i was preaching it and i started bringing points about demas how he might have started questioning because paul he was with him and he'd see his eyes get all runny and festered up and paul had to cancel meetings because he couldn't see and then he'd finally start coming to a little bit and coming out of it and he'd write a little small book and paul said i had to to write this with large letters now the book itself wasn't about five or six chapters but he's actually talking about the size of the letters can you imagine him sitting there and trying to look at it demons sitting over watching and say this can't be right i've seen that man lay hands on the sick and watch them i've seen him lay hands on a man with a bloody flux i've seen him do this and that another he's losing his ministry he's washed up he's finished then he wrote to one of them and said whenever you come down here timothy to visit me would you bring that coat i left up our troas i forgot my code up there and demons saw a man like that was only one goat i can't follow such a man demas of course was a wealthy guy a lot of goods and things around him we come down to the end and paul said all men have forsaken me they've all left me sitting down are the rats running over his feet drop old molded bread down there to him and demon said how could that be a servant of god i just can't believe it brother now i'll tell you i i'm really sorry i i'd like to make a recanting video and put it on youtube now i'm free from that that cult called paul i'll tell you brother and i i repent before you and i i join sides with you all now and i i'm against that paul lord god let me just tell you the way i feel if you folks in a year from now or a week or a month besides you no longer want to go this way of the message of malachi 4 and you figure the only way to shut me up is to vote me out if need be i'll walk out of here with my wife even if my daughters don't follow my son-in-laws my granddaughters i'll walk out by myself before i will recant this word that has changed my life and you folks that have left the message you want us to leave this and follow you would you please send me your testimonies of how many are getting filled with the holy ghost by following you please tell me how many are getting delivered of addictions please tell me how many are getting healed of cancers please let me know how many are getting delivered of besetting sins as carol and i talked with someone after church on sunday and i began to talk by the spirit of god and asked the person something they wanted to say and they talked for just a couple of minutes maybe and i started talking led of the holy ghost and i just kept talking kept talking and kept talking and i told the individual i'm sorry i didn't mean to take all your time now you say something and the person said you answered every question that i had on my heart i don't have anything else left to say so some of you that want to argue your theology you come and do that don't prove it by your words but paul said i will know the power of them not their words i'm not here to argue i'm not here to debate let's see the god who answers by fire come on now don't get scared well if you all have been sent to set us free from this message bondage you ought to have signs god always confirms the word with signs following oh but you're great theologians but you have no power huh well sorry this ignorant kentucky boy ain't going to follow you because my god is a god of supernatural well come on children what about it happy valley you want to leave you want to go back to that old vomit back to that old pig pen you were in not me i like it out here being free from all that mud i like it out here being free from all that stuff don't you praise god you'll find a hog return back to that pig pen but you'll never find a sheep there in the first place is that right my i don't get worried at all when i see a hog wallering in the mud but if i see sheep down there i'd say boy there's something bad wrong because why it's different from a nature of a sheep to get in such stuff i don't marvel that hogs go and lead to apostasy but i know that genuine elect can no more leave this word then god can leave them they are germatized to the seed of life hallelujah and you cannot burn it out of them you cannot pull it out of them whenever they tried to get polycarp to deny it he said i'm an old man he said in hell my days he's done me good oh polycarp you're an old man come deny him now and he said i cannot deny him i will not recant can you imagine as they stood there and they burned them at the stake and they pierced them through with the sword and they offered them wealth and they offered them money but the true one stood there and said i will not recant but on the other hand there was some and they come right to the point of death 30 seconds before they died and recanted can you imagine leaving this world and the last word spoken where i hate jesus christ god keep me faithful god keep me faithful if i lose my strength if old age sits in and i lose my mind i can't remember and i don't know you and you and you and you don't let me lose my seal don't let me lose my birth don't you love him children hallelujah oh but i take this verse and you know it's so sad really when you look at it been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness but that can all be said about you you see god will never say that about you nor will you ever say that as i said sunday job curse the very day he was born nobody that's ever truly born again ever curses the day they drew the breath of life from the breath of god praise be to god asparagus together blessed lord god lord i can't say that i rightly understand these last couple of wednesday nights you're speaking to us in a very serious serious tone very somber lord god help us if there's one year tonight in the visible audience or those in the invisible lord dear god that needs to move up higher a prayer speak to us i don't think there's an honest person that would hear this that cannot say we all need to move up closer to you lord help us father lord jesus help us to be cleansed and things set in order but lord god we don't want a furnace department with no cane lord god we want it to be furnished but we want only one occupant to move in and take our presidents praise be to god hallelujah hallelujah it's the song of solomon we know is written in such an intimate way that for years the jews would not even allow their children to read it until they reached a certain age because it seems so clear and so plain it's baffled theologians for years but yet lord god we don't look at it in a vulgar sense but we look at it father as an intimacy between you and your beloved we see it as your love for her and her love for you the father god we don't read a church member we don't read somebody that you have to be them to come to church and they come every now and then we read somebody who's so in love with you they love you with all their soul lord god help us i pray i'm sure each of us lord this last year it would be honest would say this year has taken somewhat of a toll on all of us for those who've had coveted lord maybe still dealing with symptoms for those who haven't i pray you'd spare them of it but lord we've not been able to have church like we normally do we've not been able to get together and fellowship with their friends lord it's it's affected us i'll be the first one lord god to say to you tonight along for the day when we can have church on wednesday and saturday and sunday we can get together saints and fellowship without a mask we can't even hug one another's neck oh god help us lord jesus may your presence i pray touch every heart here tonight lord father maybe some of them are feeling just really down and low because the various things are going through may they feel your great hand just slip around them as it were tonight father and here you whisper to him i said i'd never leave you i never forsake you i know you're feeling sad and you're disappointed this friend has let you down and this loved one and this preacher has disappointed you but you can trust in me oh jesus we love you lord we worship you tonight blessed god thank you lord jesus whisper tonight father to the lonely hearts the abandoned ones to those who are low lord god in the name of jesus may you who hides in the lattice the secret places of the stairs may your bride catch a view of your countenance because we know what to look for to some it's shadowy and it's parabolic and it's metaphoric and people look i don't understand i can't figure it out i tried to read the bible i can't figure it out oh i ain't going to try but the bride says no no no he wants me to search he wants me to look i've got to put forth the effort it looks like a shadow and then it looks unclear but then she begins to look and her her eyes receives heavenly enlightenment then she says oh is that an eye is that a nose that's a lock of hair that's that's his chin that's his brow the more she looks the more she sees as you begin to open our eyes lord god enlighten us to who you are how great you are father we worship you tonight lord jesus can we just worship him just a little saints before we go oh praise be to god hopefully lord willing we'll be able to gather more here on sunday we'll have a little bit more normalcy hopefully for a while but you know if we do or if we don't i've come to realize that through this covet and through all this that we've gone through i've not been able to see you all like i want to you haven't been able to see me i've not been able to hug none of you only ones i feel comfortable hugging is those got antibodies you know what i mean because i don't want to pass nothing on to nobody and then you hug him and you think oh should i do that or not but i've come to realize that even though i can't hug you i can still hug jesus and i might feel the distance of you folks come in the office for interviews and they come in with masks on it i tell them take it off if you want to for my sake why why because we we feel so edgy we feel so concerned don't tell me that don't bother spiritually but let me bring you into an august court tonight you can take your mask off lay your worries aside step up into the place the cherubims will move back and give you first priority into the presence of god you believe he's here to minister to you praise be to god let's just worship him just a little bit now we know there's a great divine approach into the presence of god of prayer but we also know there's an approach of praise and worship by which we begin to magnify his name and just bless his name and he pulls us into this place of privacy and brother branham uses the word august courts august courts so we don't want the outer court or the inner court we want the august courts of his being where it just pulls us right in brings healing minister strength that evil spirit that's tormenting your body your mind or your soul that will have to leave you at the name of jesus hallelujah at the name of jesus we worship you tonight lord those of you at home in your car in your office if you can bow your head pull over if you're in your car safely praise god let the holy ghost minister to you right where you are in the name of jesus be loosed from that oppression brother or sister that's sitting there and you feel so bound in the name of jesus christ as a servant of god i condemn that evil saying may it leave you now brother blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah lord god may your great presence go to living rooms and kitchens and offices places of business automobiles lord god father we send your word for the bible tells us he sent his word and healed them lord god in the name of jesus we pray for our church we pray for our brothers and sisters lord god in the name of jesus may our assembly father be healed and delivered granted i pray lord we worship you father sing something hey let's just worship him together can we can we take a few moments before we go let's just close our eyes now and enter into this place that was once forbidden of the gentiles or satan would have loved to stop the gospel he tried to anoint them jews the most religious people of that day to stop the light from reaching the gentiles but god had them ordained to eternal life and god was able to get his word to him your mother your father your aunts your uncles your former pastor many of them tried their very best to keep you from getting this word but god went around them god went above them god went under them god bypassed them and got this word to your heart and birthed you and he didn't birth you to lose you remember satan may think he's got our nation he may think he's got our world he may think the left has taken over the social media the left is taking over this and taking over that but i want to remind him tonight they ain't got the throne room they ain't got the kingdom of god in the hearts of the saints of god they don't have the kingdom of heaven hallelujah what belongs to heaven still belongs to heaven what belongs to heaven pre-election still belongs to heaven here we are in january what belonged to heaven oh my about before the foundation of the world still belongs to heaven tonight here we are 20 21 and jesus has not lost to one let me serve notice on hell tonight you'll never get the throne room you'll never get one heart of one saint of god oh you've got the earth and look what you've turned it into you've got hell and look what you've turned it into but let me tell you about a place that's off limits to you satan you have never stepped your foot inside that new city or you've been allowed to tread upon that original place called heaven you've been around allowed to go into where the throne room is now but you have never been allowed to set one foot inside those pearly gates because it is a city of the redeemed not one demon has ever stuck its foot in the river of life not one power out of hell has ever stuck one eyeball or stuck his head inside the gates of that city because it's created for the heavenly bridegroom and his earthly bride it is our city it is our home that's how confident our master is that there is a bride on the on the earth that is his he's so confident he's gone away to prepare a place for us not only that he's already got the gates hung the gigantic hinges have received the gates of pearl it's already there waiting the angels are there waiting for the saints of god to throne the beautiful streets of that city praise be to god oh praise be to god we worship you jesus we worship you jesus don't you love himself don't you love him aren't you glad tonight to be a son or daughter of god you may be so poor that you ain't got enough money in your pocket to stop by the drive-through and get you a soft drink or a hamburger but if your name is found there declared by the lamb of god your name spoken before the foundation of the world you are one of the richest people that has ever drawn breasts on this earth oh praise god we worship you lord jesus thank you brother daryl won't you come buddy amen i want to say i know it's been difficult for brother daryl been not been able to go out on the field and evangelize and all but i've so enjoyed brother darrell been able to be with us haven't you been able to pray for us preach for us pray with us so glad to have a man like him amen amen antibodies praise the lord isn't the word so precious friends and you can see the the reality of where we're at in time and the pattern of the word and it's just going home time friends and the things that we're seeing taking place and i went down this afternoon to feed my horse standing down there by the gate and while standing there begin to think about moses and children of old and how they'd come down to the red sea i just got to thinking about what a troublesome time that that was that the sea was in front of them and here come pharaoh and this eventual army behind them to destroy them and not knowing exactly what was going to take place they they'd come out of something they was following the message but now there was this ocean in front of them and while standing there i just saw moses turn to him and say hold your peace and i thought oh my that's that's right don't let them take your peace friends he said i give you peace not as the world giveth that i give you this peace and don't let them take that peace don't get caught up in the nervousness and all the confusion and the aggravation don't lose your peace remember who we are that he'll not leave us nor will he forsake us we're going to cross the sea for him we're going over we're going to our land to our home to our kingdom amen it's more real than this friends and it's right here at the door and i say let's press on amen amen may the lord bless you rich let's just bow our heads in prayer tonight heavenly father i'm just so grateful lord that you have given us the revelation of your word in this hour lord we can see even as they done it unto the groom even so will it be unto the bride lord for the word is being made flesh and the flesh is being made word lord and his brother don't he said lord ever overtake that for the word of god will never fail and we're a part of that word lord so we have peace tonight in knowing god that all things work to the good no matter how how dark it would seem to be or how nervous it would seem to be it's working for our good lord bringing us to that place that you had of us in your mind before there was ever a world lord god we're just so grateful that we can see these things lord and know where we come from and know where we're going and knowing lord that there's something within us that even we get weary and feel like letting go there's something in us that won't
