[24:25] again
[24:26] [Applause]
[24:33] forgiving again
[24:38] [Music]
[24:48] praise the Lord don't you appreciate his
[24:51] grace I'm so grateful that God has given
[24:55] us of his abundant grace and mercy but
[24:58] I'm grateful that we in this day of
[25:00] abuse of grace that we understand grace
[25:04] does not mean that we can live in a way
[25:05] we want to and keep doing it over and
[25:09] over and over again and that's what
[25:11] grace is for that's not what grace is
[25:13] for grace is to help us in the time of
[25:17] need not to excuse us for a lack of new
[25:20] birth amen to be able to think of the
[25:24] essential love and projection of
[25:27] Almighty God kundan Singh from the great
[25:30] eternal into the form of the logos this
[25:35] type of glory can never be replicated
[25:38] yet the Lord Jesus prays that we would
[25:41] be able to share with his glory that
[25:44] glory was that which was given to the
[25:46] son from the father not of his essential
[25:50] being but of that which he endured as a
[25:53] mediator this great honor to become a
[25:57] son what an honor it is for us as sons
[26:00] and daughters today when we do that we
[26:03] are sharing of that glory which the Lord
[26:07] Jesus prayed Father I pray for them may
[26:12] this glory which I had with thee before
[26:14] the world began
[26:15] may they be able to endure it you may
[26:18] look at yourself to dance that what in
[26:19] the world have I ever done look how
[26:22] frail I am that's what you're looking at
[26:24] from the human side but God looks at you
[26:27] the way you really truly are
[26:29] we need understanding friends to help us
[26:32] to understand such a love that's right
[26:35] amen those of you that missed the
[26:37] service I'm telling you it was just
[26:39] absolutely tremendous
[26:40] or just used by the David I just saw
[26:44] appreciate it and we've got another
[26:46] service your Lane before us today and
[26:47] we're believing the same Lord Jesus has
[26:49] laid something on his heart for our
[26:50] needs today and then he has needs of
[26:53] course I know you do physical spiritual
[26:55] financial whatever they are but keep in
[26:57] mind that the greatest thing that hat
[26:59] can happen to us today in the service is
[27:01] to receive a revelation from the Lord
[27:03] that no matter what our need is that God
[27:06] is the sufficiency the provision to be
[27:09] able to help us with that need let's
[27:12] sing together Harry is the Lord we'll
[27:13] just open our hearts to his word and all
[27:16] the Lord Jesus in the simplistic way
[27:19] that he has of dealing with us as human
[27:20] beings
[27:21] liking himself to a bridegroom as we
[27:24] looked at it last night but the David
[27:25] bringing so beautifully of Hosea as him
[27:28] walking himself to a man likening
[27:30] himself to so many things well here the
[27:32] common term today used by so many this
[27:35] man was a self-made man he took himself
[27:39] and he done this and that neither but in
[27:40] reality the true and original and only
[27:45] self-made man
[27:47] was God because he made himself a man
[27:53] all of us were born and maybe we were
[27:56] given abilities and we had to struggle
[27:58] to make ourselves and raised ourselves
[28:00] out but really he's the only self-made
[28:03] man and he did that that he might
[28:06] transform us that was appreciate him
[28:09] with all your hearts thank God for His
[28:11] mercy sing something for say it's just
[28:14] hoping a horse that I agree
[28:19] she'll always be my soul
[28:26] [Music]
[28:29] was a slore there by my
[28:38] [Music]
[28:46] just
[28:54] [Music]
[29:06] [Music]
[29:43] [Applause]
[29:50] [Music]
[30:00] [Music]
[30:13] [Music]
[30:18] [Applause]
[30:22] [Music]
[30:27] [Laughter]
[30:41] [Music]
[30:48] all of my fall
[30:52] [Music]
[31:01] raise the Lord aren't you glad he's not
[31:07] dependent on this flesh he looked beyond
[31:11] your mistakes or troubles or
[31:12] shortcomings he saw the predestinated
[31:15] seed that was living on the inside of
[31:17] you
[31:18] Psalms 102 verse 12 but to go to the
[31:21] scripture this morning Psalm 102 verse
[31:23] 12 what a great honor it is been to be
[31:26] here with you this weekend like to look
[31:32] again on being loosed from the house of
[31:34] your bondsman Psalms 102 verse 12 but
[31:40] Thou O Lord shall endure forever and thy
[31:44] remembrance unto all generations thou
[31:48] shall arise and have mercy upon Zion for
[31:53] the time to favor her now what she uses
[31:56] us first the time to favor her yay the
[31:59] set time is come so he tells us that
[32:03] he's going to arise because of his
[32:06] remembrance to all generations and he
[32:09] tells us the time to favor her the set
[32:13] time has come this morning I woke up and
[32:16] I was looking at this portion of the
[32:18] scripture and this keeps going over and
[32:21] over in my heart this week and for some
[32:23] time he's going to favor the dust he
[32:27] said for the time to favor her the set
[32:29] time has come this just that terminology
[32:33] the set time it's not the English word
[32:36] that we use Chronos which means
[32:38] chronological order after one comes two
[32:41] after two comes three after three comes
[32:43] four but it actually comes from the word
[32:44] Kairos which is actually referring to an
[32:47] event it's something that's been
[32:50] pre-planned there's an occasion that's
[32:54] going to take place as the tabernacle
[32:56] the Feast of the Tabernacles feasts of
[32:58] the wave sheaf so there's an event an
[33:00] occurrence not one two three Cana
[33:03] logical but actually a predestinated
[33:05] moment a pre-planned occasion he uses
[33:09] the same term
[33:10] ecology glory to God in Genesis 17 where
[33:13] elegan was going to visit Abraham and he
[33:16] said at the appointed season I will
[33:18] return it comes from the Greek word
[33:20] Kairos it's the same word used in
[33:23] Genesis 24 when Eliezer went to get
[33:26] Rebecca because it was evening time it
[33:29] was the set time that the virgins would
[33:32] go to the well and God had pre-planned a
[33:34] woman to meet a messenger where he's the
[33:39] Lord
[33:40] it's a predestinated moment or we say
[33:43] prophetic arrangement thou shall arise
[33:46] and have mercy upon Zion the time to
[33:48] favor her yay the set time has come for
[33:52] thy servants take pleasure in her stones
[33:55] and favor the dust thereof so the temple
[34:01] would be destroyed and David's
[34:03] prophetically saying that God's going to
[34:05] remember but he's not just going to
[34:07] remember the stones because they could
[34:09] tear down the stones they can tear down
[34:12] the courts but one thing they can't take
[34:14] away they can't take the dust away and
[34:17] God says I'm going to remember and favor
[34:20] that spot that dust so then the heathen
[34:28] shall fear the name of the Lord and all
[34:30] the kings of the earth thy glory notice
[34:34] what he calls their going to fear the
[34:36] name of the Lord and the kings of the
[34:37] earth my glory when the Lord shall build
[34:40] up Zion he shall appear in his glory he
[34:43] shall regard the prayer or the destitute
[34:45] and not despise their prayer this shall
[34:47] be written for the generation to come
[34:49] the people which shall be created shall
[34:51] praise the Lord for he had looked down
[34:54] from the height of his sanctuary and
[34:56] from heaven did the Lord behold the
[34:58] earth this is why to hear the groaning
[35:01] of the prisoner and to loose those that
[35:04] are appointed to death to declare the
[35:07] name of the Lord in Zion and praise in
[35:10] Jerusalem
[35:11] Gabriel's instructions of Daniel 1961
[35:13] God never did deal with Israel till she
[35:15] come to her homeland
[35:17] you hear me thus saith the Lord God will
[35:20] not deal with his church till she comes
[35:22] back to the homeland
[35:24] the message of the hour comes back to
[35:28] the original a man I'd like to speak to
[35:31] you on that today I would like to look
[35:33] from this direction favoring the dust by
[35:36] the Lord has list his words you can be
[35:37] seated today it's quite a setting and we
[35:45] know that God has ordained for Zion to
[35:50] be a the place where God would set up
[35:53] the temple where God would set up the
[35:55] tabernacle it would be in God's provided
[35:59] place that he would ordain this specific
[36:03] spot for his children to be able to come
[36:06] and worship and out of all the places on
[36:09] the earth today we'll run the same
[36:11] parable from last night the parallel
[36:13] rather that God would actually choose
[36:16] this place that God would choose this
[36:19] spot out of all the places that he would
[36:22] create and put up on the face of the
[36:24] earth that God would choose this place
[36:27] of Zion it would be Palestine that God
[36:31] would choose out of all the places upon
[36:33] the earth today now Moses tells us in
[36:36] Deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 11 he said
[36:39] then shall there be a place at which the
[36:40] Lord your God shall choose to call his
[36:43] name to dwell there so this isn't
[36:46] something that man has decided to be
[36:49] able to come to this place and to be
[36:50] able to set up this this place for God
[36:52] to be able to meet him at but actually
[36:55] this is God's provided place this is
[36:58] God's place that he has initially called
[37:01] for this as we would say for this this
[37:03] worship to be able to be restored this
[37:06] worship to be able to be set up and God
[37:08] did not leave this up to the agency of
[37:11] man that man would have the ability to
[37:13] choose a certain spot or choose a
[37:16] favorite place that they would like or
[37:18] what they think is a beautiful spot what
[37:19] they think is a great place but rather
[37:21] God chose this area and we know that
[37:25] God's choosing God's God's allotment as
[37:28] we would see no doubt that God can look
[37:30] across the earth there would be a lot of
[37:31] beautiful places that God could choose
[37:33] to be able to put this but God you know
[37:36] by the natural eyes we've
[37:37] we would think well God could have chose
[37:39] this land over here it's such a
[37:41] beautiful place or he could have chose
[37:43] this land over here there's more water
[37:44] that would come to this land or there's
[37:46] more grass that's more populated that
[37:48] the animals could be able to feed better
[37:50] and the cattle will MA they would grow
[37:52] and become so fat and then you know
[37:54] maybe would choose somewhere that would
[37:56] have a great big trees that would grow
[37:58] up from the earth but God did not choose
[38:00] at many of those places but God chose
[38:02] Israel and we know that God looked down
[38:05] upon Israel and that God was going to
[38:08] favor this land and so much that God had
[38:12] instructed Israel that when they would
[38:14] come into the land that God is going to
[38:16] allow the same parable with the people
[38:18] he's going to also run that to the land
[38:21] that when they would come into the land
[38:22] the first thing that God did my promise
[38:25] is he tells them this is what I want you
[38:28] to do when you come into this special
[38:30] place when you come into this ordained
[38:32] position the first thing that I want you
[38:34] to do is I want you to tear down every
[38:37] altar of these false gods the first
[38:39] thing I want you to do is I want you to
[38:41] take and tear down these groves and burn
[38:43] them up remember burning in the
[38:44] scriptures atop a judgment I want you to
[38:47] judge this false idolatry I want you to
[38:50] judge this false worship and I want you
[38:53] to tear down their altars so as God
[38:55] wants the people to be holy as God wants
[38:58] the people to be separated God wants the
[39:01] place that he has provided for worship
[39:04] he wants that location to be set apart
[39:07] as well now Deuteronomy chapter 12 verse
[39:10] 3 you would tell them and you shall
[39:12] overthrow their altars and break their
[39:14] pillars and burn their groves was fire
[39:16] and you shall hear down the graven
[39:19] images of their God and destroy of their
[39:22] gods and destroy the names of them out
[39:25] of that place so notice it was in that
[39:28] place where these other gods was going
[39:31] to be worshipped that God is not going
[39:33] to take and allow his people to be able
[39:35] to come into this land and he's not
[39:37] going to share this place with other
[39:40] gods
[39:42] I said he's not going to share this
[39:44] place with other gods if there was other
[39:47] gods that was in the provided place he
[39:50] wants you to dare tear down every altar
[39:53] every Idol that you may have he wants
[39:56] you to completely destroy because God
[39:58] ain't gonna share his worship with no
[40:00] other gods in this place he wants it to
[40:03] be set apart he wants it to be holy he
[40:06] wants it to be a consecrated place unto
[40:09] himself and God don't want you sharing
[40:11] his worship with nothing of this world
[40:13] nothing of laodicea
[40:15] nothing in this time he wants to have an
[40:17] exclusive rights to himself he don't
[40:22] want to share your praise with nothing
[40:24] else he don't want to share your praise
[40:25] with Hollywood he don't want to share
[40:27] your praise with football stars and
[40:29] baseball stars and rock and roll stars
[40:32] and country music stars he don't want to
[40:34] share his glory with nobody else when
[40:36] you come into the land tear down them
[40:38] all altars he tells them I want you to
[40:46] take and I want you to tear down the
[40:48] names of their gods in that place so he
[40:52] does not want their name even he don't
[40:55] want the mission of their name in the
[40:58] place where God's provided so he tells
[41:01] them tear down these pillars then take
[41:03] the Groves and destroy the Groves in
[41:05] other words this is the place where I'm
[41:07] gonna put my name this is the place
[41:10] where my presence is gonna dwell at and
[41:12] I'm not going to share it with nothing
[41:14] else now notice what he tells it in
[41:16] court in Deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 10
[41:18] he said but when you go over Jordan and
[41:20] you dwell in the land which the Lord
[41:22] your God giveth you to inherit and when
[41:25] he giveth you rest from your enemies
[41:29] round about so that usual in safety so
[41:32] when they come into this chosen place
[41:34] this provided place when they come into
[41:36] the position that God had ordained them
[41:38] to be able to come into he's going to
[41:40] favor them and by this favor a man he's
[41:44] going to give them rest from their
[41:46] enemies
[41:47] now notice they cannot have rest until
[41:50] every idolatry has been torn now
[41:53] cannot possess this kind of rest as long
[41:56] as the names of them other gods is in
[41:58] this place but when they are torn down
[42:00] he said I'm gonna give you rest from
[42:02] about your enemies so that you dwell in
[42:05] safety can you imagine this ain't a mere
[42:07] man saying this to thee but this is
[42:10] Jehovah God this is the creator of
[42:12] heaven and earth and he's letting them
[42:14] know I'm gonna give you rest from your
[42:17] enemies and when it comes to safety
[42:19] you can dwell in this provided place and
[42:21] safety you don't have to worry about a
[42:23] rogue enemy coming by and taking you out
[42:25] you're going to dwell in the land in
[42:27] safety so it may have taken them a while
[42:32] to be able to go through this land to be
[42:34] able to take in to tear these altars
[42:37] down it may have to come quite some time
[42:38] to be able to tear these images down but
[42:41] let me tell you they was going to
[42:43] eventually overcome and you are
[42:47] eventually going to overcome because God
[42:50] had already sent a time hey man he's
[42:54] already said a season an allocated time
[42:57] by his word that you are going to dwell
[42:59] in the land of safety hallelujah he's
[43:02] already gonna want it by Kairos by the
[43:05] appointed season you are going to
[43:08] overcome hallelujah then what's God
[43:12] gonna do he's gonna look down from the
[43:14] heart of his sanctuary and behold the
[43:16] deaths the wrath and you're gonna
[43:17] receive favor from the Lord rest from
[43:20] your enemies again he promised it in
[43:22] Joshua chapter 21 verse 44 and the Lord
[43:25] gave them rest roundabout so not only
[43:27] did he tell them they're gonna have rest
[43:30] but now he's bringing that promise to
[43:33] pass and he give them rest roundabout
[43:37] according that he sware unto their
[43:39] fathers and there stood not a man of all
[43:41] their enemies before them because the
[43:43] Lord delivered them out all of their
[43:46] enemies hand so their failed not on any
[43:49] good thing which the Lord had spoken
[43:52] unto the house of Israel look at these
[43:55] next words all came to pass
[43:59] that already encouraged you this morning
[44:02] if God said it it will come to pass it
[44:06] may take a while it may take a few
[44:07] months it may take a few years but
[44:10] eventually because God has already made
[44:12] an oath by his spoken word that word
[44:14] will not fall short but it will come to
[44:16] pass just as not said it would do for
[44:18] all shall come to pass when God speaks
[44:22] his word his word will not fail when God
[44:25] honors his covenant hey man you can take
[44:28] God's Word and base your life upon it
[44:30] knowing that God's Word cannot tell us
[44:33] [Applause]
[44:35] notice it's in God's provided place
[44:37] remember it was going to be David that
[44:41] David was going to be anointed before
[44:44] the Lord remember how that the prophet
[44:46] Samuel had come down why David was yet
[44:48] in his adolescence and we would see how
[44:50] that Samuel would come down and all by
[44:53] the natural eye he would have chose
[44:55] another land to be able to be king by
[44:58] the natural ID program tells us there
[45:00] was some man that was bigger than the
[45:02] other but he began to look around but
[45:04] that wasn't God's provided person that
[45:07] wasn't God's choice that wasn't why God
[45:09] had ignored it but it was going to be
[45:11] David that was going to be anointed by
[45:14] the prophet Samuel Samuel is not moving
[45:16] by education he's not moving by the
[45:18] cydonia he's looking for God's provided
[45:21] person and you realize that David would
[45:26] have to find a million battles and how
[45:28] the David before he could take his
[45:30] throne that would have to be some
[45:32] overcoming in David before he could take
[45:35] his physician be able to take his spot
[45:37] but David of course at this time had not
[45:40] taken his physician as yet because David
[45:43] had some overcoming to do David had some
[45:45] Cochran to be able to do but then there
[45:47] come a season then there come a time
[45:49] like a rose but come a time when David
[45:53] any man was gonna put the enemy behind
[45:56] him and he was going to step into his
[45:59] position hoarding the second samuel 7 of
[46:02] 1 and it came to pass when the King sat
[46:04] in his house when the kings
[46:08] in his house and the Lord had given him
[46:12] rest around about from all of his
[46:15] enemies until the king came to his house
[46:19] David did not have no rest but jog over
[46:23] to God but just as soon as David came to
[46:26] his physician came to his place came to
[46:29] authority
[46:30] when David sat in his house the Lord
[46:33] gave David rest from his enemies I hope
[46:39] you follow me that the king said unto
[46:41] Nathan the prophet see now I dwell in
[46:44] the house of cedar the Ark of God
[46:48] dwelleth within curtains so after he
[46:53] comes to his place God favors him from
[46:57] his enemies and David when he sees this
[47:01] favor Dave his desire is I want to build
[47:05] a tabernacle for God to be able to dwell
[47:08] him
[47:08] so notice David wants a place after he
[47:12] comes to rest
[47:13] hallelujah he wants to be able to build
[47:16] God a permanent place to be able to
[47:19] dwell him now notice where David wants
[47:22] to build this app he wants to build it
[47:24] in this special lamp this is God's lamb
[47:27] this is the place that God shows favor
[47:30] to and David wants to build God a place
[47:32] to dwell in Jerusalem oh I'll just say
[47:36] this God would not let David build the
[47:38] temple because David had shed too much
[47:40] blood David according to the scripture
[47:43] he had shed blood but it was going to be
[47:46] after the shedding of the blood there's
[47:49] gonna come another officer Paul of the
[47:51] Sanna David and the seller David was
[47:54] going to build a place for God to be
[47:57] able to dwell and so because of the
[47:59] shedding of the blood God would have a
[48:02] tabernacle hallelujah to be able to
[48:05] dwell in after the shedding of the blood
[48:09] now God is specific and how he wants
[48:13] this there's no there's no wiggle room
[48:15] in this God tells him exactly the way he
[48:17] wants us to be not only did he want it
[48:20] to be built a certain way he wanted it
[48:22] to be built on a certain place but he
[48:25] tells him exactly how big that this
[48:27] Tabernacle should be he tells him how
[48:29] many rooms it's going to be what the
[48:30] size of the rooms is going to be how
[48:32] many courts is going to be in it and
[48:34] this temple is not something David
[48:36] designed this is what God designed and
[48:38] sent the word to David and then it was
[48:41] David's responsibility to taking it the
[48:43] word of Solomon hallelujah and once
[48:46] Solomon received David's word he built
[48:48] it according to the word of the Lord it
[48:54] would be a place set aside for God a
[48:56] place that God could put his name a
[48:59] place where they could worship think
[49:01] about this don't just put it anywhere
[49:03] put it in Zion put it in sign that's his
[49:07] ordained spot God is always showed favor
[49:12] to that spot God's always show favor to
[49:16] Zion
[49:16] it's a special place for God in so much
[49:20] that God loved Israel so much he would
[49:24] call the people by the name of the land
[49:27] that they was going to dwell in a clean
[49:34] spoon feed you this morning just had to
[49:35] hang on he was going to call his people
[49:38] by the name of the land that they was
[49:41] going to dwell in so you realized that
[49:43] that was the name they was going to be
[49:45] called by the name of their homeland the
[49:48] name of their inheritance hallelujah
[49:50] the name of God that he ordained them to
[49:52] be he was going to call his people by
[49:55] that name of that city it's God's
[50:01] ordained place it's God's predestinated
[50:04] place God ordained this place so much
[50:08] that it would be built in Zion that
[50:10] every Old Testament sankt would want to
[50:13] be buried in that special land come on I
[50:16] said they wanted to be buried in that
[50:18] particular place where God shows favor
[50:21] to that's where they want to be buried
[50:23] at that's where job was buried at that's
[50:25] where Jacob was very down
[50:26] that's where Sarah's buried that that
[50:28] was where we're at in the land of
[50:30] promise but why Palestine why in that
[50:36] particular place why not somewhere else
[50:39] that'd be more convenient to be able to
[50:42] bury the dead
[50:43] why not somewhere else why why would
[50:46] they go many times to the extreme to be
[50:50] buried in this land
[50:51] why is it that they would it seemed like
[50:54] it'd be so unconventional would be so
[50:56] much easier to do it a better way
[50:58] let's just be buried over here just be
[50:59] buried over there why do they want to
[51:01] come to this land
[51:04] notice the Jacob tells us in Genesis 47
[51:07] 29 and the time drew nigh and the time
[51:11] drew nigh that is from us diatom at
[51:15] Jacob and he called his son Joseph and
[51:18] said unto him him now I found grace in
[51:20] thy side now notice he's warning his son
[51:24] to look down upon hill hallelujah and he
[51:28] says if I found grace and the word grace
[51:30] means favor if you looked upon me and I
[51:35] found favor in your sight
[51:37] could I pray thee thy hand under my
[51:40] thigh and he'll kindly and true lose me
[51:42] bury me not I pray thee in Egypt but
[51:46] I'll allow with my father's and thou
[51:47] shalt carrying me out of Egypt and bury
[51:50] me in the burying place and he said I
[51:52] will do as thou has said
[51:54] so Joseph notice now Jacob tells Joseph
[51:58] I want you to make a covenant with me I
[52:02] want you to make me
[52:04] promise make me a no I don't want you to
[52:06] forget about this this ain't something
[52:08] I'm just gonna say because I'm in my own
[52:10] age or maybe I'm till there I want you
[52:13] to take either one I'm telling you I
[52:15] want you to give me an old give me a
[52:17] pledge that she won't bury me in Egypt
[52:21] in so much that Jacob I'll think about
[52:24] it
[52:25] he would tell his son give me your hand
[52:27] and put your hand on the hand put your
[52:31] hand in the space put your hand in the
[52:35] place where God touched me act I want
[52:38] you to put your hand in the same place
[52:40] where God made a covenant with me I want
[52:43] you to put your hand I want you to put
[52:46] it in the same place make a cabinet by
[52:49] putting your hand where the angel touch
[52:50] me
[52:56] hallelujah I want you to put your hand
[52:59] where God's hand was at and I want you
[53:01] to spit when you put your hand in that
[53:03] place where it pulls me to walk
[53:05] different it calls me to live but I was
[53:07] a blessed liver I was blessed because I
[53:11] lived I was blessed because that's a
[53:13] covenant with God put your hand put your
[53:19] hand over that spot right there that
[53:21] special place that special place where
[53:28] the Lord touched me that night and I
[53:31] want you to speak the word of Covenant
[53:35] over that place I want you to vow before
[53:39] God that when y'all come out don't you
[53:44] leave me here and you are going to come
[53:47] out and when you leave I want you to
[53:51] pack me along with you so there was
[53:54] going to be a group of people who is
[53:57] packing the bones of a dead prophet
[53:59] everywhere they went
[54:01] hallelujah notice besides this this him
[54:05] wanting to be able to to come out with
[54:08] him because he don't want to be married

[54:50] we preach resurrection and there's some
[54:52] distant gods was a favor hallelujah and
[54:55] God's will is show favor upon death
[55:03] no now there was some beautiful places
[55:05] down in Egypt no now that boy had some
[55:07] tremendous cemeteries with a lot of
[55:09] decoration maybe there was nothing up
[55:12] there in Palestine at this time but I
[55:14] want to tell you that prophet didn't
[55:15] care about decorations he didn't care
[55:17] about natural things he wanted to be
[55:20] buried in the ordained place where God
[55:22] allocated his word two paintings dust
[55:28] disfavored dust I said it's a favorite
[55:31] place they wanted to be buried in the
[55:36] position where God would favor the dust
[55:40] Egypt was cursed the Land of Nod was
[55:47] cursed Babylon was cursed but not
[55:52] Palestine Palestine is the land of
[55:56] promise so God would show favor to those
[56:01] who's buried in the promised land God
[56:08] would show favor to those who's buried
[56:10] in the promised land now notice if you

[59:49] days for them days and they know that
[59:51] just one that job says I know not
[59:53] Redeemer liveth the last nations stand
[59:54] upon there and they know that job had an
[59:56] idea where he was going to stand so he
[59:58] said bury me here they wanted to be with
[1:00:02] Joseph were with Jove and they buried
[1:00:04] right around there in Palestine because
[1:00:07] that was the promised land they note the
[1:00:11] resurrection wasn't going to be in Egypt
[1:00:13] it wasn't going to be in Europe it
[1:00:17] wasn't going to be somewhere else it was
[1:00:19] going to be in Palestine so they buried
[1:00:22] them there because Palestine is the land
[1:00:26] of the Resurrection it's the land that
[1:00:29] the firstfruits which they would plucked
[1:00:30] the first one that come forth from the
[1:00:32] ground the first one from the crop they
[1:00:35] would take it and they would wave that
[1:00:36] one over the rest of the crop and when
[1:00:38] they would raise that one over the rest
[1:00:40] of the crop they wouldn't have to go out
[1:00:41] there and examine every every piece that
[1:00:43] come up out of the field they know God's
[1:00:45] law every sink fourth of its own kind
[1:00:47] they wouldn't have to go out and examine
[1:00:49] the rest of the crop but they would
[1:00:50] examine the first one hallelujah the
[1:00:53] first one
[1:00:54] came forth from the grave that's the one
[1:00:56] that would be exhibit and Jesus
[1:00:57] resurrected and he sprinkled his brother
[1:00:59] from the mercy seat took me what bring
[1:01:01] acceptance for you and I oh my the
[1:01:09] resurrection was it gonna happen down in
[1:01:12] Egypt it was only in the promise there
[1:01:15] is no resurrection anywhere else but
[1:01:18] where God puts his name at do you
[1:01:21] realize that's why God told Abraham to
[1:01:24] leave your father's house I want to
[1:01:27] bring you out I want to alert you have
[1:01:31] and lead you to a certain place in a
[1:01:33] certain land and that's where I want you
[1:01:35] to dwell that right there do you know
[1:01:38] why that's where God was gonna visit
[1:01:40] after it was in that land that Elohim
[1:01:45] would come down and speak to Abraham and
[1:01:48] Sarah now God had showed faith though
[1:01:53] they've got ain't no respecter of
[1:01:54] persons well he may not be but he is a
[1:01:56] respecter of his own life he is a
[1:01:58] respecter of his own seat and God showed
[1:02:01] favor to Abraham and Sarah and he told
[1:02:03] Abraham Abraham you're gonna be a father
[1:02:06] and his seed now watch he tells him your
[1:02:08] seed is gonna be like the dust but yet
[1:02:13] it would be numbered like the Stars
[1:02:15] notice he would tell him it's going to
[1:02:18] be like the stars do you realize that
[1:02:20] scientist tells us some of the very same
[1:02:24] things that is found on stars and on the
[1:02:28] moon and in the Sun is some of the very
[1:02:31] same elements that's found right here in
[1:02:33] this earth right so it ain't that
[1:02:38] there's such a difference between our
[1:02:40] dirt in that dirt
[1:02:42] but it's the position they're put in
[1:02:46] it's the position that they're called to
[1:02:49] come on
[1:02:50] you look up and nine you see them stars
[1:02:52] listen across the stars and you think oh
[1:02:54] my look how bright that is
[1:02:56] that's such a heavenly star and it's not
[1:02:58] so much that the dirt is so different
[1:03:00] it's the place where God put it at
[1:03:02] [Applause]
[1:03:07] hallelujah God tells Abraham I want you
[1:03:11] to have a son oh my
[1:03:12] and notice to a man that doesn't have
[1:03:16] one cent yet those are big words but
[1:03:19] watch he said and Sarah thy wife so he's
[1:03:24] not telling him just any land can
[1:03:27] produce this son not just any woman can
[1:03:31] produce this son but God is very
[1:03:34] specific on what parcel a ground
[1:03:37] hallelujah that he wants the promised
[1:03:40] son to be burned out of paint say no
[1:03:45] better than that
[1:03:45] I said God has a specific place as a
[1:03:48] specific location that he wants sons to
[1:03:51] birth sons out of and then why is he
[1:03:55] gonna come through nobody but God's
[1:03:57] allotted woman she's God's chosen place
[1:04:02] she was God's chosen vessel no now hey
[1:04:06] guards dust listen friend there ain't no
[1:04:09] different it was both dust but is that
[1:04:11] Sarah was put in a special place
[1:04:14] hallelujah as a matter of fact by the
[1:04:16] natural eye no doubt it will it look
[1:04:19] made sense by the natural thinking of
[1:04:21] man by the natural a man's - oh well you
[1:04:24] know you a Hagar's younger Sarah's older
[1:04:28] it seemed like that would make sense
[1:04:31] here's you want here is Hagar she's
[1:04:34] fertile but Sarah's ever had one son it
[1:04:38] would been a lot more convenient
[1:04:41] a lot more convenient to be able to
[1:04:46] bring it through Hagar but the problem
[1:04:48] was that's not the land that God chose
[1:04:50] she was not God's chosen place she was
[1:04:53] not God's elected place to be able to
[1:04:56] produce this promise she was not a
[1:04:58] covenant wife she was not included in
[1:05:03] the promise she was not included in the
[1:05:05] Covenant come on church she could not
[1:05:07] produce the blessing
[1:05:08] listen Hagar can have gifts she can have
[1:05:11] blessings but she cannot produce the
[1:05:13] spoken word of God so at a set time
[1:05:23] hallelujah and a crayons atop God's
[1:05:27] gonna favor
[1:05:29] Sarah now watch the way this favor works
[1:05:33] that God did not leave this to Abraham
[1:05:38] but God comes down himself God come down
[1:05:44] and picked up a handful of so he favors
[1:05:53] some dust and he creates a body and God
[1:05:58] oh mighty God stepped into that body of
[1:06:02] dust come on somebody notice what God
[1:06:07] was doing he was going to use a dust
[1:06:10] body hallelujah he's using dust to speak
[1:06:15] to dust he's using dust to favored us
[1:06:18] come on church he's using dust
[1:06:21] hallelujah he's using does elements out
[1:06:24] though are you hear me he uses preachers
[1:06:27] he uses it does to speak the promise of
[1:06:30] God's Word over Sarah
[1:06:37] and the Lord descended from heaven with
[1:06:41] a shout which is a message what's he
[1:06:46] gonna do what's he here for what's he's
[1:06:49] showing up now why would God come to
[1:06:53] this dried-up desert why would he come
[1:06:57] to a place that ain't hardly got any
[1:06:59] grass left or any water left
[1:07:01] because God's intending on visiting his
[1:07:04] children so he descends from heaven and
[1:07:08] he has a message with him listen to me
[1:07:12] this message ain't just for everybody
[1:07:19] but this message is for specific people
[1:07:24] it's for specific people so a lithium
[1:07:28] was not sent to bring the message to
[1:07:32] Sodom because Sodom cannot produce this
[1:07:36] message it's not God's chosen place come
[1:07:42] on church ala him did not pick up dust
[1:07:44] and go down to Egypt Egypt was not God's
[1:07:47] provided place but this message was sent
[1:07:51] to Abraham's tent it was sent to
[1:07:54] Abraham's family God was sent to the
[1:07:59] place where the promise was going to
[1:08:00] come out of and the promise wasn't gonna
[1:08:03] come out of them sodomites
[1:08:06] come on Church the promise ain't gonna
[1:08:10] be birthed out of the Egyptians not
[1:08:13] gonna be birthed out of the Canaanites
[1:08:14] hallelujah ain't gonna be birthed out of
[1:08:17] the hip-hop's for the air it's gonna
[1:08:18] come through Sarah it's gonna come to
[1:08:20] Deadland and he tells Abraham I will
[1:08:24] certainly return to the according to the
[1:08:26] time of life I will return unto thee
[1:08:31] according to the Queiroz and those Sarah
[1:08:36] thy wife shall have a son
[1:08:38] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:08:40] was behind him and of course she hears
[1:08:43] what God says in her land her dust it
[1:08:47] laughs
[1:08:53] and God cast her aside said you ain't
[1:08:55] elect no more you're in the promised
[1:08:57] child Oh more you laugh at me I'll just
[1:09:00] kick you to the side come out
[1:09:01] he cannot just cast her away hallelujah
[1:09:06] said he cannot cast her away
[1:09:07] he cannot forget about her she's already
[1:09:10] included in the promise yes she laughed
[1:09:13] yes she made a mistake but she still
[1:09:16] held the promise that got over their
[1:09:17] life a mistaken town could not change
[1:09:27] the eternal word I know people think one
[1:09:34] of this divorce is gonna in me mistakes
[1:09:36] in time cannot change the eternal word
[1:09:38] what God is already populated by his
[1:09:40] word he cannot change his mind but he
[1:09:42] left it seems it's not one day you're
[1:09:46] gonna be or one day you're gonna because
[1:09:47] you already seeds are already cold
[1:09:50] you're already elected Jewesses 1814 and
[1:09:57] he said is there anything too hard for
[1:10:00] the Lord and at the time appointed at
[1:10:04] the time at the season at the hour at
[1:10:07] that predestinated moment at that
[1:10:09] occasion I'm gonna return unto thee
[1:10:11] according to the time of a life
[1:10:15] Sarah shall have a son there's an
[1:10:20] appointed occasion for this and allotted
[1:10:23] season to manifest this promise son I'm
[1:10:27] just going to tell you Ishmael was not
[1:10:31] Abraham son
[1:10:34] I said Ishmael was not Abraham son
[1:10:41] Ishmael was Abraham's son
[1:10:52] his smile Colonus abraham could not
[1:10:56] produce and Isaac as long it was in the
[1:10:59] ride an inground but when it got in the
[1:11:01] wrong way in the government of the right
[1:11:02] promised God had to change Abraham's
[1:11:05] name hallelujah and were god's name
[1:11:07] would dwell and that's where the promise
[1:11:09] was gonna come out of in the land where
[1:11:14] he puts his name in the land where he
[1:11:16] puts his name and the land where he
[1:11:18] shows favor that's where the promise is
[1:11:20] gonna come to about news for you that
[1:11:28] was Abraham son then tell me why God
[1:11:30] said Abraham take down son thine only
[1:11:33] son he favors he favors the dust
[1:11:45] he's always favored that land
[1:11:48] he's always favored Pacific places not
[1:11:53] something that man come up with not
[1:11:56] something that man manufactures but it's
[1:11:59] what God's promise has been allocated
[1:12:01] for a certain spot under there a certain
[1:12:03] purpose in a certain time right even
[1:12:07] when it didn't even make sense
[1:12:08] like this situation right here there's a
[1:12:11] woman named Rahab living in the walls of
[1:12:14] Jericho Jericho is a cursed City
[1:12:17] I said Jericho was a cursed City and she
[1:12:22] lived in Jericho a long time
[1:12:24] but let me say this she was not in her
[1:12:27] right position yet she did not have rest
[1:12:30] from her enemies but notice something
[1:12:32] started happening around Reds house a
[1:12:36] set time at a certain occasion begin to
[1:12:39] take place and her time to be loosed
[1:12:41] from the house of her bondsman the time
[1:12:44] to be set free
[1:12:46] come to receive favor she hadn't been
[1:12:51] around them canaanites long enough
[1:12:53] she'd been around those denominational
[1:12:54] walls long enough now it's time to favor
[1:12:56] her that's when God came her way notice
[1:13:02] what happened some spies come into this
[1:13:06] city and Joshua had signs Joshua had the
[1:13:13] same signs and Moses had the Holy Ghost
[1:13:17] right how didn't ask to see Joshua sign
[1:13:20] she just heard a top of the church the
[1:13:27] top of the true church that's been
[1:13:28] pulled away from prostitution you say
[1:13:32] I'm Methodist say I'm madness come on
[1:13:34] principal tarian the next day pulled
[1:13:35] away in prostitution but all of a sudden
[1:13:39] a little preacher enters a little
[1:13:47] preacher enters the city and said and
[1:13:51] said there's a God that lives there's a
[1:13:55] God that lived that yesterday he's the
[1:13:57] same today his powers just the same he
[1:13:59] does the same works that he did when he
[1:14:01] was here on earth
[1:14:02] his ancients plural his agents are on
[1:14:07] the road right had the harlot notes she
[1:14:12] was the harlot she was the top of the
[1:14:13] believer today no this is the real
[1:14:16] believer she didn't say now I hear
[1:14:17] Joshua can do science because he's the
[1:14:19] success from Moses I like to see those
[1:14:21] signs no if I could see those signs and
[1:14:23] I believe it will he didn't absolutely
[1:14:26] have to show those signs because she
[1:14:28] believed it anyhow come on she wasn't
[1:14:35] there and BC down in Egypt she went
[1:14:38] there in BC out in the wilderness she
[1:14:40] went there the Red Sea she wasn't there
[1:14:42] in that land she wasn't there when the
[1:14:44] Kings got destroyed but she hurt I said
[1:14:47] she hurt
[1:14:48] and when the right appropriate season
[1:14:50] ain't meant that the Word of God would
[1:14:52] fall upon the ears on this predestinated
[1:14:55] see that God living in Jericho her city
[1:14:58] that God planned to do something to this
[1:15:01] dust she said I heard what God's done
[1:15:06] for you I heard I destroyed the Kings I
[1:15:08] heard hi open up the Red Sea I've heard
[1:15:10] what God has done and faith cometh by
[1:15:12] hearing and hearing by the and she told
[1:15:15] the whole notices and she says the
[1:15:17] smiles I'll hide you I hide you I hide
[1:15:23] this message but I'm gonna need a favor
[1:15:30] I'm gonna need you to show me favor I
[1:15:33] need favor look at this two preachers
[1:15:40] imparts a word of promise to Rahab that
[1:15:45] would keep her during the hour of
[1:15:47] judgment
[1:15:48] [Applause]
[1:15:50] now notice these spawns did not have to
[1:15:54] run back to Joshua and get permission to
[1:15:56] give her this Scarlet thread they didn't
[1:15:58] run back to the duster said can we give
[1:16:00] her a promise can we give her the word
[1:16:01] can we let her in on it can we let hurry
[1:16:04] on this one they didn't have to ask
[1:16:05] permission the word was his word that
[1:16:08] her promise was his promise dar boys was
[1:16:11] his voice their mouth was his mouth I
[1:16:22] was ambassadors that was ambassadors for
[1:16:26] Joshua and their word kept that church
[1:16:30] in the hour of the judgment if it was
[1:16:37] enough for Rahab living in a place of
[1:16:39] judgment living behind these walls come
[1:16:42] on church living in a nation that's
[1:16:44] forsaking God taking him out of our
[1:16:46] schools taking him out of our Court huh
[1:16:47] if they reject him what about today
[1:16:54] he says and I was with Moses she never
[1:16:56] seen God she never seen the works of God
[1:16:58] she just heard others had seen it and
[1:17:01] she believed by hearing it now she said
[1:17:06] I want favor for me and my father and my
[1:17:15] mother come on

[1:17:19] got something it's some brother I want
[1:17:21] to have faith for them and the spies the
[1:17:27] preachers

[1:17:35] preacher said listen 130 listen at the
[1:17:40] message yes he's coming he's coming this
[1:17:44] way
[1:17:45] and we're going to take the land notice
[1:17:49] what they're telling her there's a
[1:17:51] promise that's coming there's
[1:17:52] fulfillment coming there's a season
[1:17:54] that's coming there's an hour that's
[1:17:56] going to take place get yourself ready
[1:17:58] [Applause]
[1:18:02] I'm gonna need something and they said
[1:18:05] here's a token this is what we want you
[1:18:08] to do with it we want you to hang it at
[1:18:10] your window put it on public display

[1:18:25] family know about it that's the way I'll
[1:18:27] know about it don't be ashamed of this
[1:18:30] put it on this big display and when
[1:18:33] Joshua comes in he'll see that covenant
[1:18:36] and he'll favor the dust and they'll
[1:18:40] save you in your house sushi done
[1:18:43] exactly what the word told her to do and
[1:18:49] when Joshua come into the land Joshua
[1:18:53] went looking around those big old walls
[1:18:55] but Ram said he was looking for a battle
[1:18:57] plan on how to take these things down
[1:18:59] come on and all of a sudden he comes to
[1:19:03] a specific place in the wall he comes to
[1:19:08] a certain spot in the wall and there's a
[1:19:11] red ribbon hanging out of the window
[1:19:13] come on
[1:19:14] and when Joshua looks there's a man
[1:19:17] standing there and he's got his sword
[1:19:19] rolled and because she wasn't ashamed of
[1:19:26] this red token come out
[1:19:28] oh yeah just because she had a Facebook
[1:19:31] account she's still presented the token
[1:19:35] there ain't no confusion about what she
[1:19:38] believes even though she had against the
[1:19:40] ground she still presented the token her
[1:19:43] words were seasoned because of the token
[1:19:48] she handled it home she held on vacation
[1:19:54] everywhere she went she had this token
[1:19:56] she didn't want to be caught without it
[1:19:58] she didn't want to be found without it
[1:20:00] because there's coming the season that's
[1:20:02] coming to town that Jen's was gonna
[1:20:03] shock and the only way to escape that
[1:20:05] judgment you must possess the token
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:14] hallelujah he's standing there with a
[1:20:16] sword in his hand it ain't the day's the
[1:20:18] first Pole no more he laid the days of
[1:20:21] second pole no more he's got a sword in
[1:20:23] his hand
[1:20:24] hallelujah John Smith's coming to
[1:20:26] Jericho and God's gonna show favor
[1:20:29] during the hour of judgment it's gonna
[1:20:33] show favor because it's the promised
[1:20:36] land so here's a woman living in the
[1:20:41] promised land she's just out of her
[1:20:43] position without a token but once the
[1:20:46] token comes in hallelujah she comes to
[1:20:48] her place she comes to her position
[1:20:51] judgment cannot strike her home because
[1:20:54] God's gonna honor the word I said God's
[1:20:58] gonna honor the word God always shows
[1:21:02] favor to those that's in the right
[1:21:04] promised in the right land remember
[1:21:08] buttrum said whenever anytime that they
[1:21:10] would leave Israel he said that you is
[1:21:13] Baxley it's only when they're in the
[1:21:14] homeland can blessings come upon them
[1:21:17] remember our top of court in the
[1:21:19] scripture that when they Omi's husband
[1:21:21] left the homeland the blessings was left
[1:21:24] in the homeland right which is a type of
[1:21:27] a Jew being backslidden God because they
[1:21:30] left the land of promise
[1:21:31] and when he got outside the promise her
[1:21:34] husband dies right they had a boy come
[1:21:38] out and his name was sickly
[1:21:43] but he married a woman outside the
[1:21:45] promise outside the covenant of Israel
[1:21:48] come on
[1:21:49] but the promise he died ruse old husband
[1:21:55] died and she tells no I mean wherever
[1:22:01] you go I want to go she been hanging
[1:22:03] around Naomi long enough she got to
[1:22:05] hearing about this Jehovah God she got
[1:22:07] to hear about the ways of God and she
[1:22:09] said we're going to go him back into
[1:22:10] that special land hey man now notice
[1:22:13] because a ruse husband being dead she's
[1:22:17] free to go to the land of promise
[1:22:22] he wasn't just divorce
[1:22:24] he wasn't set aside for another occasion
[1:22:26] her own husband was dead dead completely
[1:22:29] dead and buried in that aside though
[1:22:34] Aram says I like this and gossamer by
[1:22:36] the way y'all hurry notice the top of
[1:22:37] the Jewish Church Ruth the top of the
[1:22:39] Gentile he said notice the Gentile
[1:22:41] Church here she comes back roots being a
[1:22:43] Gentile heathen worship her she looked
[1:22:45] back and she said I'll go with you where
[1:22:48] you live I'll live or you die I'll die
[1:22:51] we're your BAE we're your BAE we're your
[1:22:57] mate I'll be buried let's sure God be my
[1:23:05] god that's the Gentile Church accepting
[1:23:07] the salvation through Jesus Christ our
[1:23:09] Lord and the second chapter Ruth it
[1:23:11] reveals her time to return and she come
[1:23:19] back just in the harvest time
[1:23:23] barley season so she don't just come
[1:23:27] back under Paul's planting season she
[1:23:31] comes back notice now not under
[1:23:33] reformers she comes back deering at the
[1:23:36] harvest time
[1:23:38] she comes back at a set time into the
[1:23:41] right land of promise she's coming back
[1:23:44] during the hour of the harvest so she's
[1:23:45] coming back to the right land and when
[1:23:48] you get in the right land in the right
[1:23:50] place under the right season something's
[1:23:52] about to happen and the Bible said she
[1:23:54] went and came and cleaned in the field
[1:23:56] after the Reapers enter her half was a
[1:23:58] lot on a part of the field belonging to
[1:24:00] Boaz who was the kindred of MLA so she
[1:24:03] ends up in Moses field you talking about
[1:24:09] blessed you talking about the right
[1:24:12] season and the right time she all of a
[1:24:15] sudden because she God's gonna show
[1:24:16] favor because she comes back to the
[1:24:19] homeland she ends up in her kinsman
[1:24:21] redeemer field there's a lot of other
[1:24:27] fields you could have ended up in come
[1:24:29] on church I said there's a lot of other
[1:24:31] fields you could have ended up here but
[1:24:33] because God looked down from the heart
[1:24:35] of his sanctuary he favors the Death
[1:24:37] Star he brought her in to rot seizes the
[1:24:39] Racha under the right message under the
[1:24:41] rod Redeemer under the rock kitchen to
[1:24:44] do art by her back but him said it
[1:24:49] happened to be that Boaz was coming to
[1:24:52] check on the harvest so the kinsman
[1:24:58] redeemer descended to where she was at
[1:25:01] and when he sees her bertram said it was
[1:25:06] love at first sight and he says don't
[1:25:10] you leave this field don't you go over
[1:25:13] here and pluck some grain out of these
[1:25:14] other denominations you stay in my field
[1:25:16] you stay in my place you stay in this
[1:25:18] spot
[1:25:19] hey man you stay out of the rest of them
[1:25:21] fields stay out of them get out of them
[1:25:23] come on over you're safe here you can
[1:25:28] have rest here for he tells her in
[1:25:31] chapter 2 verse 9 let thine eyes be on
[1:25:33] the field that they do reap and go
[1:25:35] though after them have not I charged the
[1:25:37] young men that they shall not touch
[1:25:39] these she's found a place where she's
[1:25:43] safe from all the enemies that would
[1:25:46] want to do her harm
[1:25:47] because the word a bolas was
[1:25:50] over her the word of Boaz had said don't
[1:25:53] you touch her
[1:25:54] come on Noah's nothing could strike her
[1:25:57] without bonus giving permission first
[1:26:03] hallelujah
[1:26:04] he doesn't charge he doesn't give his
[1:26:06] word he done made his I'll study hearing
[1:26:08] you're safe here what did she do to earn
[1:26:12] this what did she do to merit this
[1:26:15] seriously what'd she do to do this
[1:26:17] deserve this she didn't do nothing
[1:26:20] she receives favor in the eyes of her
[1:26:24] kinsman redeemer and because God favored
[1:26:28] the dust
[1:26:29] she got redeemed God favors this land
[1:26:35] it's this land that God ordains to
[1:26:39] receive favor God wants it to be set up
[1:26:44] just right that's reasoning when Solomon
[1:26:46] sets up this temple God tells him
[1:26:48] exactly house to be done he's careful to
[1:26:50] build it exactly the way God told him to
[1:26:51] listen friends them stones wasn't just
[1:26:54] stones that was gonna be God's place to
[1:26:57] dwell at that rock wasn't just gonna be
[1:27:00] eating Rock that dirt wasn't just any
[1:27:01] dirt but when Solomon had everything in
[1:27:04] its place when he put everything in its
[1:27:07] rightful position when he lined up
[1:27:10] according to the word of the Lord
[1:27:12] notice the stones her stones had to be
[1:27:15] in her place and when the stones got in
[1:27:20] her place and the dust was in its right
[1:27:23] place
[1:27:23] the Lord descended down upon the
[1:27:27] tabernacle the Lord descended upon Ray
[1:27:30] had the Lord descended on earth and the
[1:27:33] Lord descended on the tabernacle first
[1:27:36] Kings eight and ten and it came to pass
[1:27:37] when the priests would come out the holy
[1:27:38] place that the cloud filled the house of
[1:27:40] the Lord so that the priests could not
[1:27:42] stand to Minister because of the cloud
[1:27:47] for the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:27:50] house of the Lord
[1:27:54] notice verse 13 I've surely built their
[1:27:57] house for dwelling in a settled place
[1:27:58] for thee to abide in forever and the
[1:28:01] king go listen and the King turn notice
[1:28:04] his face he turned his face and he
[1:28:11] blessed the congregation of Israel so
[1:28:16] God's presence his face would turn from
[1:28:20] the king and the Kings face shows favor
[1:28:26] the Kings face being turned means the
[1:28:30] people are a blessed people bertram says
[1:28:33] like this an indication of the lord
[1:28:34] descended down upon the place till it
[1:28:37] filled the entire temple the pillar
[1:28:39] flower came in there was such great
[1:28:41] glory of God to the ministers could not
[1:28:43] Minister any more because of the glory
[1:28:46] of the Lord glory of God that's when it
[1:28:48] found its final resting place that's
[1:28:50] when it found its final resting place
[1:28:52] for Sakana glory that followed those the
[1:28:56] capping stone not the corner the capping
[1:28:59] stone the main thing all the other
[1:29:03] stones is not effect until via notice
[1:29:05] every other stone did not come into
[1:29:08] effect until the end but when the
[1:29:10] capping stone comes every other stone
[1:29:12] comes to its place because God casts it
[1:29:15] but this main stone came in the
[1:29:18] headstone and it took its place
[1:29:22] positionally for it's resting place for
[1:29:25] that generation and the glory god fill
[1:29:28] the place where they were sitting there
[1:29:29] was a Chicana glory upon the whole
[1:29:32] building so when the headstone comes to
[1:29:35] its place it finds a resting place now
[1:29:40] watch it's God's ordained spot for that
[1:29:45] stone and then God sends his glory the
[1:29:48] rim says it like this let me close if
[1:29:50] the headstone come in Luther's time
[1:29:52] look what out-of-the-way place it would
[1:29:55] have been so God caps off Luther's
[1:29:58] message it's out of its way it's out of
[1:30:00] place look at me come in Wesley's time
[1:30:02] notice it's gone it'll come in its own
[1:30:05] it will come in its own predestinated
[1:30:08] time so god a lots a season for the cat
[1:30:13] stone to descend but the church will be
[1:30:16] honed in such a condition until the
[1:30:18] church's ministry the church's ministry
[1:30:20] will be so close he'll be just exactly
[1:30:22] another kind of ministry that Jesus had
[1:30:24] to make it all fit together for the them
[1:30:30] rocks less of this they don't hold on
[1:30:32] regard their rocks laying up there for
[1:30:34] hundreds of tons lying out there it's so
[1:30:36] close together without mortar they can
[1:30:38] even run a razor blade between them and
[1:30:40] when the head stone comes Christ comes
[1:30:43] to his it'll have to fit perfect like
[1:30:49] the rest of it then david says thou
[1:30:54] shall arise and have mercy on zion for
[1:30:59] the time to favor her yay the set time
[1:31:02] has come so there's a time and a season
[1:31:05] there's a people there's a land there's
[1:31:09] a message
[1:31:10] there's a cat stone there's a glory
[1:31:12] hallelujah it's all going to come
[1:31:14] together at the right time for thy
[1:31:16] service take pleasure in her and favor
[1:31:20] the dust thereof
[1:31:22] look what david says in verse 16 when
[1:31:24] the lord shall build up Zion he shall
[1:31:28] appear in his glory we had when he
[1:31:30] builds up sign when he gets Luther's
[1:31:32] message Wesley message pinnacle when he
[1:31:34] sends the castle he gets every one of
[1:31:36] them lined up he's going to appear in
[1:31:38] his glory
[1:31:38] he'll regard the prayer the destitute
[1:31:40] not despised our prayer then this shall
[1:31:43] be written for the generation it heard
[1:31:44] the people which shall come by the
[1:31:46] spoken word shall praise the Lord for he
[1:31:51] looked down from the height of his
[1:31:53] sanctuary from heaven did the Lord
[1:31:57] behold the earth he looks down from the
[1:32:01] heights of his sanctuary he looks down
[1:32:05] upon this earth
[1:32:09] a little yeah
[1:32:12] and when he looks down from the height
[1:32:15] of his sanctuary notice he's looking to
[1:32:18] the right brother branham said which
[1:32:20] means that's where the thief on the
[1:32:21] cross that received favor
[1:32:23] he got favored he's looking for his
[1:32:25] bodies looking for his ride she receives
[1:32:30] favor because he looked out from the
[1:32:32] half of his sanctuary Psalms went over
[1:32:37] to verse 20 what's he looking for to
[1:32:39] hear the groaning of the prisoner to
[1:32:41] lose those that are appointed to death
[1:32:46] to declare the name of the Lord in Zion
[1:32:49] and this praise interest stand our feet
[1:33:06] Oh aren't you glad but REM tells us how
[1:33:11] the god when his picture got taken in
[1:33:14] the cloud he said he was looking to the
[1:33:16] right said we looked at that picture
[1:33:19] wrong and it took a messenger to show us
[1:33:21] exactly how to look at it and what eyes
[1:33:24] to look through but I want to say we've
[1:33:26] recognized who it is and it amazing
[1:33:30] that's why they condemned Jesus they
[1:33:34] said Jesus ain't nothing he's a man
[1:33:36] trying to make himself God you know how
[1:33:40] they missed it he was not a man trying
[1:33:42] to make himself God he was God that made
[1:33:45] himself a man and God conned in sinning
[1:33:51] and looked down upon man because that's
[1:33:53] where he wants to dwell at in his temple
[1:33:56] in his place he wants to dwell he wants
[1:34:00] to be the utmost part of every one of us
[1:34:02] and he don't want any other name upon us
[1:34:04] he don't want some denominational name
[1:34:07] over you he wants his name over you it
[1:34:11] was to be our husband he wants to be our
[1:34:12] Redeemer hey man he wants to make a love
[1:34:15] to his people because they belong to him
[1:34:18] he can't simply forget about her and
[1:34:21] cast her aside but he looked down and he
[1:34:26] undid the shackles from the neck of his
[1:34:29] people and he took off the shackles of
[1:34:31] denominationalism and he said now arise
[1:34:34] and sit arise and serum come up how that
[1:34:38] oh dust your favorite aren't you glad
[1:34:41] you are

[1:42:43] Eden and God chose another spot and

[1:47:27] they laughed at him and they made fun of
[1:47:30] him and when you look at the documents
[1:47:34] that have been found many many years ago
[1:47:36] and called a uniform it was actually
[1:47:39] documents from the time during the time
[1:47:41] of Abraham and seen real estate
[1:47:44] exchanges of what value of property was
[1:47:47] worth he paid an exorbitant amount for
[1:47:51] this property it made no sense they
[1:47:55] laughed at him they ridiculed him but he
[1:47:58] had insight into that land there was a
[1:48:02] cave there of course and we know the
[1:48:04] name of the vicinity today was the Cave
[1:48:05] of Machpelah
[1:48:06] and it had two doors going into the cave
[1:48:10] one to go in I wanted to come out if we
[1:48:21] all live the natural course of human
[1:48:24] life we'll all find the door in but I

[1:48:38] kill they all got together the sons of
[1:48:40] else the Hittites and they made fun of
[1:48:42] Abraham and they laughed at him and they
[1:48:46] laughed in him but Abraham when he said
[1:48:48] praise God I didn't know where job was
[1:48:52] buried at but all of a sudden by vision
[1:48:55] I saw it in that land of the
