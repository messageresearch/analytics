[43:56] chapter 1 verse 13.
[44:02] job chapter 1 verse 13.
[44:08] setting of our
[44:09] reading today is in
[44:11] the land of us
[44:14] us was located
[44:16] in
[44:18] the western part of the arabian desert
[44:22] near the country of
[44:25] chaldea
[44:27] the bible says in job 1 and 1 and there
[44:29] was a man whose name was job and he was
[44:32] a perfect man upright before god he
[44:36] feared god and skewed evil which means
[44:39] that he voided stayed away from
[44:42] evil
[44:44] and verse 13 says and there was a day
[44:46] when his sons and his daughters were
[44:48] eating and drinking wine in their eldest
[44:50] brother's house
[44:52] and there came a messenger unto job and
[44:55] said
[44:56] the oxen were plowing
[44:59] and the asses were feeding beside them
[45:02] and the sabians fell upon them
[45:06] and took them away
[45:08] yea they have slain the servants with
[45:10] the edge
[45:12] of the sword
[45:13] and i only
[45:15] am escaped alone to tell thee
[45:21] now that would be a pretty bad situation
[45:24] but notice verse 15
[45:26] while he
[45:29] was yet
[45:30] speaking more bad news
[45:34] there came also another and said
[45:37] the fire
[45:40] of god
[45:44] notice the fire
[45:48] of god
[45:51] is fallen
[45:53] from heaven
[45:56] wow
[45:58] pretty impressive huh the fire

[47:23] we all are needy i've heard many needs

[47:35] for those father who are
[47:37] still dealing with
[47:39] loved ones that have gone on
[47:42] yesterday lord having to go over to

[47:57] would just help them
[47:58] may the spirit of god comfort their

[48:08] we believe you're the god who can
[48:11] comfort us when no one else can
[48:14] speak to us today father we ask
[48:17] in the name of the lord jesus
[48:19] and the saints of god said
[48:21] amen amen god bless you
[48:24] you may be seated
[48:26] keep your bible there and let's
[48:28] continue reading
[48:31] in verse
[48:32] 17. so the first messenger
[48:35] says that
[48:37] they were plowing with the oxen and they
[48:39] were feeding the
[48:41] asses and the sabians came
[48:44] and took them
[48:45] all away
[48:47] while he was yet speaking
[48:49] another one came and said the fire of
[48:52] god
[48:52] has come down from heaven
[48:55] and burned up all the sheep
[48:57] and the servants
[48:59] were also burned up verse 17 says
[49:04] while he
[49:06] was yet speaking
[49:09] i want you to think
[49:11] of what a scenario
[49:13] that this must have been the man did not
[49:17] have
[49:18] a couple of days
[49:20] a couple of weeks
[49:22] or a month
[49:23] to go from one great traumatic thing
[49:27] to another
[49:28] but one messenger standing there
[49:31] and giving him this
[49:33] terrible
[49:34] awful news
[49:36] and while he is yet speaking
[49:39] another one comes in the door
[49:42] and starts telling him more
[49:45] bad news
[49:47] now i want to speak to you again today
[49:49] on the absolute
[49:51] and you better believe
[49:53] job needed one
[49:56] while he was yet speaking there came
[49:58] also another and said
[50:00] the chaldeans
[50:03] made out three bands
[50:05] and fell upon the camels
[50:08] and have carried them away
[50:10] yay and slain the servants
[50:14] with the edge of the sword
[50:17] and i
[50:18] only and escaped alone
[50:21] to tell thee
[50:23] while he
[50:24] was yet
[50:26] speaking
[50:28] there came also another and said
[50:31] thy sons
[50:33] and thy daughters
[50:36] were eating and drinking wine and their
[50:38] eldest brothers
[50:39] house
[50:42] and behold there came a great wind
[50:45] from the wilderness
[50:47] and smote
[50:48] the four corners
[50:50] of the house
[50:52] and it fell upon
[50:55] the young men
[50:56] word actually men there's people
[50:59] so it's the young people job's family
[51:01] and servants
[51:03] and they are dead
[51:05] and i only
[51:07] am escaped alone
[51:10] to tilt thee
[51:12] it shows that
[51:15] awful things
[51:17] can happen
[51:19] to good people
[51:21] and not just one or two things
[51:25] every now and then
[51:27] but one blow
[51:29] after another
[51:31] after
[51:32] another
[51:33] now remember job is actually the oldest
[51:37] book in the bible older than genesis
[51:41] so genesis
[51:43] was not written
[51:44] when this happened to job
[51:46] as a matter of fact job had no written
[51:50] word
[51:51] he had no bible
[51:54] no quotes
[51:56] no tapes
[51:58] no quote books
[52:00] no pastor
[52:02] no deacon
[52:03] he had no committee
[52:05] to come
[52:06] and encourage him
[52:08] but job
[52:10] had an absolute amen
[52:14] now the way is that the writer we're not
[52:16] even sure who actually
[52:18] wrote the book of job
[52:20] but he writes it in such a way
[52:24] to project the mysterious part
[52:27] about the will of god
[52:29] so the wind come
[52:32] and here's proof again that satan
[52:35] is the prince of the power
[52:38] of the air
[52:40] as he is churning today
[52:43] down in the gulf of mexico
[52:46] with a cat 4 hurricane that will be
[52:49] making landfall
[52:51] sometime this evening
[52:53] and we know that since man fell and gave
[52:57] away his title deed to the earth then
[53:00] satan became the prince of the power of
[53:03] the air
[53:04] so he has ability to
[53:07] stir up wind and he understands
[53:10] barometric pressure
[53:12] straight line winds and vertical and
[53:14] horizontal winds and the way that they
[53:17] move
[53:18] he understands the way that sun is able
[53:21] to warm the temperature and cause the
[53:24] thermal waves to move the way they come
[53:27] over the mountains and so on
[53:30] so he knows a lot about this earth
[53:33] hemisphere stratosphere all that we're
[53:36] living in so he gets into all of that
[53:39] to be able to manipulate it but he loves
[53:43] to
[53:44] do these things and then turn around
[53:47] and blame it
[53:49] on god
[53:51] and if you read your insurance policy if
[53:54] it's like mine
[53:55] and probably most of those in america
[53:58] it will have those little small words
[54:02] that are written in the fine print
[54:04] called
[54:05] an act
[54:07] of god
[54:09] now let me just tell you today it is not
[54:12] our father that is down there in
[54:14] hurricane ida
[54:16] that is going to make landfall and do
[54:19] all kinds of destruction and take all
[54:22] kinds of people's lives
[54:24] but satan loves to do those things and
[54:27] then hide behind the name of god
[54:31] or the act of god
[54:33] as you can see the writer here and one
[54:36] of these verses called the fire that
[54:39] come down out of heaven fire from god
[54:44] no doubt they attributed the great wind
[54:46] and this was quite normal and is so even
[54:49] today and this part of the desert that
[54:53] the winds can start moving in in the
[54:56] desert and i've spent time myself in the
[54:59] desert and it's amazing how it can be so
[55:02] hot during the day and then as it begins
[55:06] to cool and the temperatures drop and
[55:09] how the same place can be so cold at
[55:12] night
[55:13] and even without trees and without great
[55:16] bodies of water to be able to regulate
[55:20] and affect the barometric pressure and
[55:22] the condensation necessary for storms
[55:26] yet the winds can travel for hundreds
[55:29] and hundreds of miles and this is no
[55:32] doubt what happened one of the winds
[55:34] that would be a norm over the western
[55:37] part of the desert in saudi arabia
[55:41] and it came while all of job's children
[55:44] were gathered together now we know this
[55:48] great event transpired
[55:50] uh because there had been a meeting
[55:54] which had taken place now let's look at
[55:57] all of the losses
[55:59] in one day
[56:00] and i would like to challenge any
[56:03] individual
[56:04] who is here today or under the sound of
[56:07] my voice streaming
[56:09] if any of you
[56:10] have had equivalent to this
[56:13] or more
[56:14] please email me
[56:16] and if you are here present
[56:18] and you've had equivalent to this or
[56:21] more
[56:22] happen to you in one day
[56:24] please raise your hand
[56:26] and we will signify that you
[56:28] are a person of great faith i don't say
[56:31] that derogatory now i say it because i
[56:34] believe and mean it
[56:36] and one day
[56:38] he lost seven
[56:40] sons
[56:42] and three daughters
[56:45] now i've had a lot of funerals to preach
[56:47] in the last few weeks
[56:49] but how would you like to been the
[56:51] preacher
[56:52] that preached those
[56:54] ten children
[56:56] of one man and one woman
[56:59] and he was not a backslider
[57:02] he was not a hypocrite
[57:04] he was not a secret sinner
[57:07] he was the most righteous noble man
[57:11] in the land
[57:13] is that right
[57:14] [Applause]
[57:15] seven sons
[57:18] and three daughters
[57:20] and one day i wrote this down so be sure
[57:22] and remember it
[57:24] job was stripped of his wealth
[57:27] 500 yoke
[57:30] of oxen
[57:32] 500 donkeys
[57:35] 3 000 camels
[57:39] seven thousand sheep
[57:42] were struck
[57:44] by lightning
[57:46] and all ten children
[57:48] by a windstorm
[57:51] now he was not allowed
[57:55] a span of time in between
[57:58] each of these
[58:00] now we all are familiar with trauma
[58:03] and we're familiar with distress
[58:06] and we know how that it triggers
[58:09] something within
[58:11] not only our spirit but our bodies
[58:14] and we've all seen so much of it more
[58:17] than our share i'm sure we feel that way
[58:20] and as we've been
[58:22] been dealing with uh several people
[58:25] passing away
[58:27] and we see the loved ones in the family
[58:29] whether it be a wife or a husband or
[58:32] sons or granddaughters or whatever it is
[58:34] and we stand there and we watch them and
[58:37] you know sometimes as a minister and us
[58:40] as i stand near where they are
[58:42] i feel like i'm on a sacred ground as it
[58:46] were that really no other mortal should
[58:50] experience because you're you're
[58:53] entering into something that is so deep
[58:56] and something that is so private between
[59:00] this this person and this loved one that
[59:03] is gone or this family and you were
[59:05] there and you're watching their body
[59:07] tremble and shake
[59:09] and you cannot see it because we're
[59:12] limited by our sight of seeing their
[59:15] spirit but how their spirit is so
[59:17] affected by this and even if they're not
[59:20] emotional people they will shake and
[59:23] tremble many times quiver
[59:26] they will buckle their knees or buckle
[59:28] and they will cry and they will mourn
[59:31] and lament and it's because of this
[59:34] trauma and this trauma is not just
[59:37] psychological it is psychological but it
[59:40] is emotional it is physical it contacts
[59:45] every aspect
[59:46] of our being and it feels like that it
[59:49] becomes so great that you do not want to
[59:52] live
[59:53] i'm sure there's people sitting here
[59:55] today whose loss
[59:57] has been not so far away
[1:00:00] and some of you are still trying to
[1:00:02] focus on what am i going to do with the
[1:00:05] rest of my life
[1:00:07] my life is of no value
[1:00:10] because the love of my wife whether it
[1:00:12] was your husband or your wife is taken
[1:00:15] from me i have nothing to live for
[1:00:19] i have nothing that i feel like will
[1:00:22] ever bring me joy or happiness again
[1:00:26] but let me speak to you today and tell
[1:00:28] you as your brother
[1:00:30] if you will allow god if god in his
[1:00:33] wisdom took that family member from you
[1:00:36] then our god makes no mistakes we
[1:00:38] believe that
[1:00:40] but yet we know in times of such pain
[1:00:43] and sorrow and agony
[1:00:45] it can be hard for us to look at a
[1:00:47] scenario and say how could this be
[1:00:51] the will of god
[1:00:52] how could something that has brought
[1:00:55] such sorrow
[1:00:56] such difficulty and such trouble ever
[1:00:59] bring honor and glory and praise to god
[1:01:04] and i agree with you there are times in
[1:01:07] our lives that we have to look by the
[1:01:09] eyes of faith and look beyond what we
[1:01:13] are dealing with currently and presently
[1:01:16] and be able to say somehow that god will
[1:01:19] work this for our good
[1:01:22] i want you to notice now in job chapter
[1:01:25] 1 verse 20 then job arose and rent his
[1:01:29] mantle
[1:01:30] and shaved his head
[1:01:32] and fell down upon the ground is this
[1:01:36] man out of his mind
[1:01:39] and worshipped
[1:01:42] he just lost thousands of sheep
[1:01:45] hundreds of donkeys hundreds thousands
[1:01:48] of camels he's lost seven sons
[1:01:52] and three daughters
[1:01:54] and his reaction
[1:01:57] is worship
[1:01:59] i wonder if he didn't understand
[1:02:01] something about worship
[1:02:03] that we are yet to learn
[1:02:06] because it's so hard for us when things
[1:02:10] are difficult for us to worship now we
[1:02:12] can feel it in the church and we know
[1:02:14] the church has been through a great time
[1:02:17] of trauma we can sense it spiritually
[1:02:19] but i can also see it in your worship
[1:02:23] i can see it when you come in and you
[1:02:25] sit down and the song leaders can feel
[1:02:27] it the musicians can feel it the people
[1:02:30] streaming can feel it they can feel the
[1:02:33] heaviness
[1:02:35] that is upon us as a body is that normal
[1:02:39] and natural it is if it's not then
[1:02:41] there's something wrong with us but yet
[1:02:44] i believe there's also a key during the
[1:02:47] time of our great trauma and difficulty
[1:02:50] and that is the key and the power of
[1:02:53] praise
[1:02:54] that we praise him when we feel like it
[1:02:57] and we praise him when we don't we
[1:03:00] praise him when things are going good
[1:03:02] and we praise him when things are going
[1:03:05] bad
[1:03:06] [Music]
[1:03:07] now job had learned somehow
[1:03:10] by this revelation that god had given to
[1:03:14] him there was great great power and
[1:03:17] praise now remember he didn't have a
[1:03:18] bible so psalms 150 was not written yet
[1:03:22] psalms 133 psalms 48 many of the great
[1:03:26] praise psalms of the old testament job
[1:03:29] knew none of them the gospel songs that
[1:03:32] you and i sing about today they were not
[1:03:35] written there were nobody there to be
[1:03:37] able to come and comfort him while they
[1:03:40] called job's comforters actually turned
[1:03:42] out to be tormentors so he really didn't
[1:03:45] have anybody even his beloved wife which
[1:03:48] had given birth to these 10 children
[1:03:51] eventually she turned against him as
[1:03:54] well
[1:03:55] and yet at the beginning at least in the
[1:03:58] stage of this great thing job was able
[1:04:01] to keep this balance and listened and
[1:04:04] said naked came out of my mother's womb
[1:04:09] and naked shall i return thither the
[1:04:12] lord gave
[1:04:13] and the lord has taken away
[1:04:16] blessed be
[1:04:18] the name of the lord
[1:04:20] in all this job sinned not nor charged
[1:04:24] god foolishly.
[1:04:27] now no doubt in his mind his wanting now
[1:04:30] this is initial stage of course of the
[1:04:32] trial and we know that job and time
[1:04:35] became changed
[1:04:37] because trials can do that to us
[1:04:40] as they are prolonged and as they keep
[1:04:43] on going and it seems like there's no
[1:04:45] reprieve it can affect our spirit it can
[1:04:49] affect our worship it can affect our
[1:04:52] understanding it can affect our
[1:04:54] psychological view it can affect so much
[1:04:58] about us even as the children of god and
[1:05:02] this is why it's so important to keep
[1:05:04] our praise going even when things aren't
[1:05:07] good because the lord jesus is
[1:05:09] praiseworthy no matter what you're
[1:05:11] dealing with
[1:05:13] but you know job unlike us today in
[1:05:16] retrospect we can look back and read the
[1:05:18] book of job and we know of course what
[1:05:21] was going on but job did not know that
[1:05:25] remember the book of job was not written
[1:05:27] so job unlike you having the book of
[1:05:30] revelation you're able to read in the
[1:05:32] back of the book you can flip over to
[1:05:34] the back and you see the back and you
[1:05:36] see the devil is going to be cast into
[1:05:38] the lake of fire and brimstone and you
[1:05:40] see that we're going to have new bodies
[1:05:42] and we're going to live forever so we
[1:05:44] have these things to look forward to
[1:05:46] because we have a written word job had
[1:05:50] not one page of written scripture
[1:05:53] so he did not have the verse that said i
[1:05:56] will never leave you or never forsake
[1:05:59] you i will be with you all the way to
[1:06:01] the end of the world job did not have
[1:06:04] the scripture delight thyself also in
[1:06:07] the lord and he will give thee the
[1:06:09] desires of thine heart job did not have
[1:06:12] the scripture beloved i wish above all
[1:06:14] things that thou mayest prosper and be
[1:06:16] in health even as our soul prospers job
[1:06:19] had none of these things and yet job
[1:06:22] still had an absolute
[1:06:25] now where was his absolute act it was
[1:06:29] not written it was not on a piece of
[1:06:32] sheepskin or written on a stone it was
[1:06:35] not on an ipad it was not upon some type
[1:06:38] of magnetic tape but yet he had to have
[1:06:41] something in order to get him through
[1:06:44] this trial where was it it was within
[1:06:48] him
[1:06:50] now it was a revelation from god that
[1:06:53] god had given a simple way to be holy in
[1:06:56] that day and job had kept it and he
[1:06:59] believed god would keep his word now job
[1:07:02] did not know also about this prior
[1:07:05] meeting which was held in heaven turn
[1:07:08] with me if you would if job chapter 1
[1:07:09] verse 6. now there was a day when the
[1:07:12] sons of god came to present themselves
[1:07:15] before the lord and satan came also
[1:07:18] among them and the lord said unto satan
[1:07:22] once cometh thou then satan answered the
[1:07:24] lord and said from going to and fro in
[1:07:27] the earth and from walking up and down
[1:07:30] in it now if you want to know what the
[1:07:32] long tongue blabber mouth does day by
[1:07:34] day he just told us he goes up and down
[1:07:38] through the earth and walking up and
[1:07:40] down in it what is he a troublemaker
[1:07:43] he's a covet maker he likes to bring
[1:07:45] divorce he likes to bring sickness and
[1:07:48] trouble and all kinds of heartache look
[1:07:50] friend covered oh satan loves every
[1:07:54] aspect of covet he loves not only the
[1:07:57] aspect of sickness and the disease part
[1:08:00] and the death part that it brings to
[1:08:02] many but he loves the confusion that
[1:08:05] covet brings he loves that people get on
[1:08:08] facebook and argue about it he loves it
[1:08:12] because one doctor says this and another
[1:08:14] doctor says that and this person will
[1:08:17] say this and another person will say
[1:08:19] that he loves for people to be confused
[1:08:23] he loves for people to argue well i wish
[1:08:26] somebody would preach with me this
[1:08:27] morning he loves for them to argue and
[1:08:30] first look let's be spiritual enough to
[1:08:32] realize whenever satan is the author of
[1:08:36] this we ought to be grown up enough to
[1:08:38] know that whenever satan tries to bring
[1:08:41] contention division in our church it's
[1:08:44] not from god it's from the devil
[1:08:49] so satan walking up and down in the
[1:08:51] earth and he's doing the same thing
[1:08:54] today now i want you to notice this in
[1:08:55] the lord and verse 8 said unto satan has
[1:08:58] thou considered my servant job
[1:09:01] that there is none like him in the earth
[1:09:04] a perfect and an upright man one that
[1:09:07] feareth god and askus evil then satan
[1:09:11] answered the lord and said doth job fear
[1:09:14] god for not in other words you're kind
[1:09:16] to job and you're giving him things and
[1:09:19] that's the reason that he's serving you
[1:09:21] that's the reason it ain't really
[1:09:23] because he loves you with all of his
[1:09:25] heart he's serving you because he got
[1:09:28] all these children he's got all these
[1:09:30] cattle he's got all this wealth
[1:09:33] then satan answered the lord and said
[1:09:35] doth job fear god for naught hast thou
[1:09:38] not made a hedge about him and about his
[1:09:42] house and about all that he has on every
[1:09:45] side thou hast blessed the work of his
[1:09:47] hands and his substance is increased in
[1:09:50] the land but put forth thine hand now
[1:09:54] and touch all that he has he will curse
[1:09:57] thee to thy face
[1:10:04] so god gives a testimony of what job is
[1:10:08] satan gives a testimony of what job will
[1:10:12] do right
[1:10:14] which one's going to win
[1:10:18] now that we have to give credit for the
[1:10:20] devil we can knock him down we can beat
[1:10:22] the tar out of him and he still gets
[1:10:24] back up and he's ready on monday morning
[1:10:27] more unlikely be ready after service
[1:10:28] today so no matter what god said and
[1:10:32] what a positive affirmative action that
[1:10:35] god took toward job satan somehow still
[1:10:38] believed that he would be able to bend
[1:10:41] job away from this testimony that god
[1:10:44] had now isn't it wonderful that almighty
[1:10:47] god testifies about people this way in
[1:10:49] heaven
[1:10:51] some of y'all scared to say amen to that
[1:10:52] ain't you
[1:10:54] now it's a tremendous thing that god now
[1:10:57] remember this is before the blood of the
[1:10:58] lord jesus job did not have a new birth
[1:11:02] he did not have a baptism of the holy
[1:11:05] ghost but he did have an absolute for
[1:11:08] that day
[1:11:09] and that absolute for that day kept job
[1:11:12] through what he was fixing to go through
[1:11:15] so god knew the integrity of his servant
[1:11:19] and god knew the man's heart but satan
[1:11:22] only thought he knew job's heart now to
[1:11:25] me this is where a lot of it comes in
[1:11:27] that satan does not have omnipotent
[1:11:30] power to look into the soul and into the
[1:11:33] nature of a human being satan studies
[1:11:35] this and of course and he sees our
[1:11:37] weaknesses and tendencies that each of
[1:11:39] us have and he's saying well if god
[1:11:41] would get this out of the way and remove
[1:11:43] this hedge then i can really crank down
[1:11:45] the pressure on that old boy and i'll
[1:11:47] see his weakness i see that strain that
[1:11:49] runs in his family i see that strain
[1:11:52] that runs in her family and if god will
[1:11:54] take back his hand i believe i can make
[1:11:56] him compromise i believe i can make her
[1:11:59] bow down to me but god said no you came
[1:12:02] now brother bam tells us the reason that
[1:12:05] god knew job this way was that he had
[1:12:08] been fellowshipping with job
[1:12:11] oh what a testimony to have so god and
[1:12:14] job had been testifying now this didn't
[1:12:16] happen about five minutes now before the
[1:12:18] trial but god and job had been big time
[1:12:21] friends so god and job had been buddies
[1:12:25] as we would say and that had fellowship
[1:12:27] one with another and god revealed the
[1:12:30] absolute for that day to job now it has
[1:12:33] not been revealed to his family it had
[1:12:36] not been revealed to his wife apparently
[1:12:38] and it had not been revealed to his
[1:12:40] friends only elohim christ of course was
[1:12:43] the one that connected with the absolute
[1:12:46] of the day so job was the only man of
[1:12:49] that day that the revelation had come
[1:12:51] clear to so god had said nope you can't
[1:12:54] do it i know him i've been
[1:12:56] fellowshipping with him we've been
[1:12:58] hanging around one another as we'd say
[1:13:00] and then why i know job job knows me and
[1:13:03] satan now notice so satan says and the
[1:13:05] lord said unto satan behold all that he
[1:13:08] has is in thy power
[1:13:11] all that he has is in thy power let me
[1:13:15] just tell you something this morning
[1:13:16] friends even satan cannot do something
[1:13:20] to god's people without god allowing him
[1:13:24] or giving him permission
[1:13:27] now remember the hedge was the power of
[1:13:30] the word now it was not that there was a
[1:13:33] rail like this or a concrete block wall
[1:13:35] or a titanium fence or something like
[1:13:38] that but the hedge was an invisible
[1:13:41] hedge by the spoken word now when god
[1:13:44] said all that he has is in your power
[1:13:47] god is simply drawing back the hedge
[1:13:50] which was the power of the word so once
[1:13:53] god allowed satan through the word and
[1:13:56] he says all right i will give everything
[1:13:59] that he has is in your power so the
[1:14:02] hedge which was the word was pulled back
[1:14:04] and only only upon himself put not forth
[1:14:08] thine hand so satan went forth from the
[1:14:11] presence of the lord now we know that
[1:14:14] there's different names in the old
[1:14:16] testament that identify the name of god
[1:14:19] he was el ella elohim it was el shaddai
[1:14:23] he was uh you know many many different
[1:14:25] titles name but the book of job it's
[1:14:28] really amazing the way that the writer
[1:14:30] writes this because he calls him
[1:14:33] almighty god now this is used 31 times
[1:14:38] actually right here in the first few
[1:14:40] verses of this setting force of these
[1:14:43] couple of chapters so the writer wants
[1:14:46] us to know that who is in charge of this
[1:14:49] whole scenario
[1:14:51] is the almighty god now it is not just
[1:14:55] el shaddai jehovah jehovah shalom
[1:14:58] jehovah's canoe but it is the almighty
[1:15:01] god so this shows us when we go through
[1:15:03] great trauma and great trials of life
[1:15:06] that it is the almighty god
[1:15:10] that is watching over us and remember
[1:15:13] satan might want to get you to think he
[1:15:16] is almighty but he is a liar
[1:15:19] there's only one almighty god and that's
[1:15:22] your father is that right so god now is
[1:15:27] going to do something that seems very
[1:15:29] very strange that he's going to turn a
[1:15:32] man and his property and his possessions
[1:15:36] over to the power of the enemy that the
[1:15:39] enemy might be able to touch him brother
[1:15:42] raymond says that this one the absolute
[1:15:44] look of job now he had an absolute
[1:15:46] everything went wrong for that man a
[1:15:48] just man and would be darrison to say
[1:15:51] that he wasn't just because god said he
[1:15:53] was there was no one on earth like job
[1:15:57] he was perfect in the sight of god and
[1:16:00] he knew it now notice he was perfect in
[1:16:05] the sight of god and he knew it now this
[1:16:08] is important when you're facing a battle
[1:16:11] when you are facing a battle of great
[1:16:13] trauma in your life you must know that
[1:16:16] god knows where you are and you must
[1:16:19] also know
[1:16:20] that you have a right standing with the
[1:16:22] lord now myself when i'm going through
[1:16:25] something i'm trying to discern by the
[1:16:27] spirit of god is this a trial that i'm
[1:16:29] going through or is this something of
[1:16:32] disobedience that i've done to the lord
[1:16:34] have i said something that i shouldn't
[1:16:36] have said did i not say something i
[1:16:38] should have said or you have a miss the
[1:16:40] lord somehow and whenever i go to the
[1:16:42] lord and prayer lord please help me to
[1:16:44] see this because if god's allowing me to
[1:16:46] go through something i don't want to
[1:16:47] rebuke it
[1:16:49] right but if satan is punching after me
[1:16:52] i don't want him to hide one of his
[1:16:55] punches behind what he calls a trial
[1:16:57] when it's not a trial at all it's just
[1:17:00] him trying to steal my victory
[1:17:02] so it's important for myself and also
[1:17:05] important for you to go to the lord lord
[1:17:07] please help me is this a trial of my
[1:17:09] faith or have i done something wrong
[1:17:12] lord are you allowing something to come
[1:17:14] upon me as a whip well if that's so lord
[1:17:16] that i don't want to rebuke it so i go
[1:17:18] before the lord and i pray and i pray
[1:17:20] and you know many times the lord doesn't
[1:17:23] tell me anything he doesn't say yes or
[1:17:26] no or one of the above or i don't give
[1:17:28] him a whole list to chat so the lord
[1:17:30] says absolutely nothing to me
[1:17:34] anybody ever been there
[1:17:36] oh okay i figured there'd been more than
[1:17:38] that i didn't realize the lord spoke to
[1:17:39] all the rest of you now i know why you
[1:17:40] don't have time to talk to me
[1:17:44] so myself i do not take silence as god
[1:17:49] did not hear me i do not take silence is
[1:17:52] god ignoring me but if i sincerely am
[1:17:55] asking my father father is there
[1:17:57] something i've done wrong is there
[1:17:59] something out of cater in my life lord
[1:18:02] help me to know is there something
[1:18:03] there's just something i need to make
[1:18:05] right i take my father's silence as an
[1:18:09] answer that there's nothing there
[1:18:12] because i know him and i know that he
[1:18:15] loves me and i love him and if i
[1:18:18] sincerely am asking him and there's
[1:18:20] something i got to straighten out he
[1:18:22] knows there's no way for me to
[1:18:23] straighten it out if he don't tell me
[1:18:26] what it is so if he does not answer me i
[1:18:29] don't say oh no oh no god's forsaking me
[1:18:32] oh no he ain't answering it yes he did
[1:18:34] answer me by his silence you say that's
[1:18:37] crazy no it's not paul said in the new
[1:18:40] testament about the women not being able
[1:18:42] to preach paul said as also saith the
[1:18:46] law
[1:18:47] but when you get time i want you to go
[1:18:49] through every verse of the law and i
[1:18:51] want you to find me one word not a verse
[1:18:53] but one word in the hebrew where it said
[1:18:56] women were not allowed to speak the
[1:18:59] torah i want you to find me one word
[1:19:01] where it said they were not allowed to
[1:19:03] speak well either that you take my word
[1:19:06] for it the word does not say they can't
[1:19:09] but it does not say they can
[1:19:12] so paul was quoting the silence of the
[1:19:16] law
[1:19:17] well praise the lord so the silence of
[1:19:20] the law as where he substantiates in the
[1:19:23] new testament that women cannot get in
[1:19:26] the pulpit and preach
[1:19:29] well praise god
[1:19:31] so the silence of the law then was where
[1:19:34] he's able to verify this and it ought to
[1:19:37] be the same with you and i would pray
[1:19:38] with all of our hearts and if the lord
[1:19:40] doesn't tell you anything apparently
[1:19:42] that means there's nothing to tell
[1:19:45] there's nothing in your way there's
[1:19:47] nothing out of cater so then you know
[1:19:50] how to approach that that god in his
[1:19:52] wisdom is allowing you to go through a
[1:19:55] trial then you can hold your head up
[1:19:57] during that trial and trust that god
[1:20:00] will give you grace and strength
[1:20:04] remember that job was a man of great
[1:20:07] great faith and great position he was
[1:20:11] the greatest man in the east at this
[1:20:13] time so he was a man of noble character
[1:20:16] and no doubt surrounded by great people
[1:20:18] and job said whenever he would go to the
[1:20:20] marketplace that the people would come
[1:20:23] up and all just to be able to speak to
[1:20:25] him and get a word or two of his wisdom
[1:20:27] because he was a man of great resound
[1:20:30] wisdom and understanding and just for
[1:20:32] them older brother joe how are you god
[1:20:34] bless you brother god bless you could
[1:20:36] you you got a word for us today from the
[1:20:38] lord god have you got something you'd
[1:20:39] like to drop with us and my they just
[1:20:42] they just be in awe of this man's
[1:20:44] presence but god had a great plan for
[1:20:48] job and it wasn't just blessing but it
[1:20:51] was to prove his faith now job is
[1:20:53] unaware of what you and i just read if
[1:20:56] god would have said no way but job don't
[1:20:58] get all upset because i'm just going to
[1:21:00] let you know what's going on here uh i
[1:21:03] had a testimony of eating about you up
[1:21:05] in heaven and i was testifying about
[1:21:07] what a great boy i had done on the earth
[1:21:09] how faithful you were how true you were
[1:21:12] how honest sincere and so on and then my
[1:21:14] enemy challenged my testimony so the
[1:21:17] enemy challenged the testimony service
[1:21:20] and i figured out the best way to
[1:21:22] resolve this this testimony dispute was
[1:21:25] to prove you before him and prove he is
[1:21:29] a liar
[1:21:30] don't you understand god many times uses
[1:21:33] our lives to prove that the devil ain't
[1:21:34] nothing but a lying devil that's going
[1:21:36] to hell and going to be burnt up one day
[1:21:39] and he ain't going to use angels to
[1:21:40] prove it he's going to use children of
[1:21:42] god like you and i
[1:21:43] that cry and weep and lament and have
[1:21:45] burdens and troubles and heartaches
[1:21:47] absolutely that's the way our father
[1:21:49] does it once you notice again the
[1:21:51] prophet said when everything seemed to
[1:21:53] be contrary sickness broke out his
[1:21:56] friends might have said now there your
[1:21:58] job that proves you are sinning you're
[1:22:02] wrong and then the bishops come down and
[1:22:04] they call job's comforters instead of
[1:22:06] comforting him they see nothing but sin
[1:22:09] in his life because god had dealt with
[1:22:12] him the way that he did his children was
[1:22:14] killed his property was burned
[1:22:16] everything went wrong even his own life
[1:22:20] in jeopardy setting on an ashy oh my
[1:22:24] broke out from the crown of his head to
[1:22:27] the soles of his feet with boils and his
[1:22:30] lovely sweet companion the mother of
[1:22:33] those children said you should curse god
[1:22:36] and die the death
[1:22:39] but in the face of all that
[1:22:41] job
[1:22:43] had an absence
[1:22:45] [Applause]
[1:22:46] happy valley
[1:22:48] what's yours
[1:22:52] every individual
[1:22:54] what's your absolute
[1:22:57] well mama and daddy mom and dad is good
[1:23:00] but you better have a deeper absolute in
[1:23:02] your soul mama can't get in your soul
[1:23:06] notice this he said in the time of
[1:23:07] sickness if we could only tie ourselves
[1:23:11] to that absolute
[1:23:13] job know that he had done jehovah's
[1:23:16] bidding he had faith in what he had done
[1:23:19] because jehovah required it if we can
[1:23:22] just do that jehovah required to burn
[1:23:24] offering for his sin and job not only
[1:23:26] for himself but for his children had
[1:23:29] made a burn offering and that's all god
[1:23:31] required all you might say i wish that's
[1:23:35] all he required of today
[1:23:37] it's less than that
[1:23:41] just faith
[1:23:43] in his word
[1:23:48] god requires less of you and i today
[1:23:52] than he did of job just faith
[1:23:55] and what god says
[1:23:58] oh if you make his words your absolute
[1:24:00] any divine promise of the bible you can
[1:24:03] die your soul to it no matter how much
[1:24:05] the waves whip you around you're still
[1:24:09] tied to
[1:24:11] your absolute
[1:24:13] no we know of course at phase one of
[1:24:17] this trial
[1:24:18] that job proved faithful
[1:24:20] his integrity was right exactly where
[1:24:23] god had said it would be
[1:24:26] but we know the trial goes on
[1:24:28] and it intensifies
[1:24:31] job chapter 2 verse 3 and the lord said
[1:24:33] unto satan as i'll consider my servant
[1:24:36] job there's none like him in the earth
[1:24:38] perfect and an upright man one that
[1:24:40] feareth god and excuse evil now god
[1:24:43] updates the testimony
[1:24:47] oh glory to god
[1:24:49] if you'll notice god says word for word
[1:24:53] what he said before
[1:24:56] but job had sent a fresh update
[1:25:00] to heaven
[1:25:02] and god updated
[1:25:05] his testimony
[1:25:06] because of the behavior of his son
[1:25:11] praise be to god
[1:25:13] praise be to god
[1:25:16] and still
[1:25:18] he holdeth fast his integrity oh my
[1:25:24] now god must update now god didn't just
[1:25:27] say the same thing that he said last
[1:25:29] time but god gave a revised version amen
[1:25:34] of what was going on he wanted to let
[1:25:36] the devil know now god wasn't just
[1:25:38] saying what he had said but he was
[1:25:40] saying what he had said plus what job
[1:25:43] did and that made the new declaration or
[1:25:46] the mandate of the day the logos
[1:25:49] so hear god can you imagine almighty god
[1:25:53] quoting
[1:25:54] almighty god quoting the success of the
[1:25:58] life of a believer on the earth that has
[1:26:01] come through such trauma and come
[1:26:03] through such difficulty and it's so
[1:26:06] moved the very being of adonai that he
[1:26:10] upgraded the testimony and the
[1:26:13] confidence that he had to say oh my as
[1:26:16] we do in the testimony well i want to
[1:26:18] thank god today that the lord saved me
[1:26:20] and gave me the holy ghost and the lord
[1:26:22] done this or that or the other and then
[1:26:24] you go through a trial and maybe you get
[1:26:26] a chance again in a month or two i'd
[1:26:28] like to testify and say thank god for
[1:26:31] saving me thank god for giving me the
[1:26:33] holy ghost thank god for bringing me
[1:26:35] through this trial i just come through
[1:26:37] what are you doing you're acting like
[1:26:39] god you're updating what god has brought
[1:26:42] you through and god said i want to let
[1:26:44] you know devil i've got a son down on
[1:26:47] the earth he wasn't just faithful but he
[1:26:50] still is faithful he is faithful to my
[1:26:53] word he has his integrity he believes
[1:26:58] what i said all children
[1:27:05] i wonder what papa
[1:27:07] has been saying about us
[1:27:10] in the last few weeks
[1:27:15] we've given him a lot to say over the
[1:27:17] years
[1:27:18] but he don't want to just repeat the
[1:27:20] past
[1:27:23] he wants to update what's the present

[1:29:04] you said the pastor would compromise
[1:29:07] once again he burnt your head again this
[1:29:09] morning devil my children worshiped me
[1:29:13] they loved me they praised me
[1:29:17] they are proving what i already said you

[1:29:35] he still hold us fast
[1:29:40] his integrity although thou

[1:29:46] against him
[1:29:51] i'll tell you one thing france
[1:29:53] we have got quite an enemy now
[1:29:55] all right
[1:29:56] but don't fear him
[1:29:58] you're more than conquerors
[1:30:01] although thou movest me against him to
[1:30:05] destroy him
[1:30:07] without
[1:30:08] cause
[1:30:12] if almighty god could say this about a
[1:30:15] man before the shed blood of the lord
[1:30:17] jesus
[1:30:18] what can god say about blood wash saints
[1:30:22] filled with the holy ghost
[1:30:25] hallelujah
[1:30:30] now watch old bible mouse
[1:30:32] and satan answered the lord
[1:30:35] and said skin for skin
[1:30:38] all that a man has
[1:30:41] he will give for his life
[1:30:45] but put forth on hand now and touch his
[1:30:48] bone in his flesh
[1:30:49] and he'll curse thee to thy face
[1:30:55] and the lord said unto satan
[1:30:58] behold
[1:31:02] he is in thine hand
[1:31:04] but save
[1:31:06] his
[1:31:07] life
[1:31:09] so satan went forth from the presence of
[1:31:11] the lord
[1:31:12] i want you to notice
[1:31:14] satan told god to do it
[1:31:17] you see he's a master of impersonation
[1:31:20] but i want you to notice who did it
[1:31:23] satan run forth from the presence of the
[1:31:25] lord and smote job
[1:31:27] the sore boils
[1:31:29] from the soul of his foot
[1:31:31] and to his crown and he took him a pot
[1:31:34] shed which is a piece of broken pottery
[1:31:37] to scrape himself with all
[1:31:39] and set down among the ashes then said
[1:31:42] his wife unto him thus i'll retain thine
[1:31:44] integrity
[1:31:46] lord have mercy children
[1:31:49] if you got a good wife or a good husband
[1:31:51] who in the world would you confide in
[1:31:53] more who would be a greater comfort to
[1:31:56] you there are all the trials and things
[1:31:57] you're going through then your companion
[1:32:00] and satan got on her
[1:32:07] oh

[1:32:10] speakest as one of the foolish women
[1:32:13] speakers what
[1:32:15] shall we receive good at the hand of god
[1:32:18] shall we not receive evil
[1:32:20] and all this did not job sin
[1:32:24] i want you to notice with what
[1:32:30] oh some of you don't smoke you don't
[1:32:32] drink whiskey you don't do marijuana
[1:32:34] this that another but you're saying
[1:32:36] right here ain't talking about cussing
[1:32:38] i'm talking about speaking out under the
[1:32:40] undefeat of defeat rather than unbelief
[1:32:43] but god don't let me god don't care for
[1:32:45] me you're sinning with your mouth when
[1:32:47] you say that
[1:32:48] you're saying things that are not true
[1:32:53] oh my god
[1:32:56] now notice the news makes
[1:32:59] it over to job's three friends
[1:33:03] job's three friends heard of all this
[1:33:05] evil that was come upon him they came
[1:33:07] every one from his own place elephants
[1:33:09] the team of night bill bildad the shut
[1:33:12] so far the nephite for they had made an
[1:33:15] appointment to come together to mourn
[1:33:17] with him and to comfort him
[1:33:19] they've been better off state the house
[1:33:21] wouldn't they
[1:33:24] now listen in verse 12
[1:33:26] and when they lifted up their eyes afar
[1:33:30] off
[1:33:33] and knew him not
[1:33:38] harry he was so disfigured
[1:33:41] by disease
[1:33:44] he was so changed
[1:33:47] by affliction
[1:33:50] the last time they'd seen him
[1:33:52] mob still had that crown of life and no
[1:33:55] doubt his skin was a healthy color and
[1:33:57] his spirit was vibrant
[1:34:00] oh he had just something to spring in
[1:34:02] his step and he had his health
[1:34:06] but his friends can you imagine them as
[1:34:08] their sin and they
[1:34:10] they come upon job's estate
[1:34:12] brother wayne as they walk up near they
[1:34:14] see the fences are broken down
[1:34:19] and they see his crops are all withered
[1:34:23] his trees and his shrubs around his
[1:34:25] house
[1:34:28] was in horrible shape
[1:34:31] the shingles as you can relate to it had
[1:34:33] blowed off of his roof
[1:34:36] his doors are hanging sideways on his
[1:34:39] house
[1:34:41] there was no one there to meet them
[1:34:45] and the closer they got job was sitting
[1:34:47] out in the yard
[1:34:50] throwing dust and ashes upon himself
[1:34:52] which was their custom as a sign of
[1:34:54] grief
[1:34:56] and they say looked and looked they said
[1:34:59] oh god
[1:35:02] oh god no
[1:35:04] that can't be joke
[1:35:08] they didn't even
[1:35:10] recognize
[1:35:14] you imagine big boys
[1:35:16] open sores
[1:35:18] which would make scabs
[1:35:20] and then he would take the pot shared
[1:35:21] and rub the scabs off
[1:35:24] to try to make them heal
[1:35:28] his wife had got bitter against him
[1:35:31] honey
[1:35:34] would you bring me a drink
[1:35:40] job said i spoke to my servants
[1:35:43] but they refused me
[1:35:45] hey so and so out in the barn come and
[1:35:47] bring me some shame
[1:35:50] i'm hungry
[1:35:53] the servants laughed
[1:35:55] mocked
[1:35:56] his wife's voice her breasts
[1:36:00] became strange to him
[1:36:03] so he just set her turn scrape himself
[1:36:05] and mourn oh
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:11] what have i done
[1:36:14] what have i done
[1:36:16] not one thing wrong
[1:36:22] how can this picture make sense
[1:36:26] his cattle are gone his wealth is gone
[1:36:28] his children is gone his wife is there
[1:36:30] but she's gone to in reality
[1:36:34] she's gone from his heart
[1:36:36] his sermons are still hanging around but
[1:36:38] they're gone too
[1:36:40] and he seemed like god
[1:36:43] it's gone
[1:36:49] and when they lifted up their eyes afar
[1:36:50] off and knew him not
[1:36:52] they lifted up their voice and wept
[1:36:56] and they rent every one his mantle
[1:36:59] and sprinkled dust upon their heads
[1:37:02] toward heaven
[1:37:04] his sickness and trials
[1:37:06] and so emaciated his body
[1:37:10] you imagine his skin all drawed up
[1:37:14] skinny his skin just pulled over a frame
[1:37:17] of the shell of a man that he was
[1:37:20] his face sunk in
[1:37:23] his eyes circles around his eyes
[1:37:26] blacks in the bottom
[1:37:29] poor old fellow sitting out turn the
[1:37:31] flies blowing him
[1:37:34] coming and eating the pus
[1:37:38] the most righteous man on the earth
[1:37:43] the most perfect man
[1:37:50] you see why laodicea don't like this
[1:37:51] kind of preaching
[1:37:53] their idea of the most perfect man on
[1:37:55] the earth is a guy that's got a set of
[1:37:57] rolls-royce keys
[1:37:59] lives in a ten thousand square foot
[1:38:01] house
[1:38:02] that's just his little summer cottage
[1:38:05] oh but he's this and that and the other
[1:38:06] because that's what laodicea considers
[1:38:08] blessings i ask you which would you
[1:38:11] rather have
[1:38:13] the mouse of god
[1:38:16] to testify about you in heaven
[1:38:19] and look like you have nothing in this
[1:38:21] earth or to be the richest man on the
[1:38:23] earth and god almighty to say about you
[1:38:26] i do not know you
[1:38:28] give me the other
[1:38:31] amen
[1:38:36] notice this friends
[1:38:39] verse 13 so they sat down with him upon
[1:38:42] the ground seven days
[1:38:45] and seven nights
[1:38:48] and none
[1:38:49] spake
[1:38:50] away
[1:38:52] unto him
[1:38:55] they were so
[1:38:57] affected by what they saw
[1:39:01] they just
[1:39:02] couldn't believe it
[1:39:04] but they didn't know what to say
[1:39:07] they just sat there day one day two day
[1:39:10] three day four they fought armed for
[1:39:12] seven days
[1:39:14] never said one word
[1:39:16] i've had a few of them comforters around
[1:39:18] ain't you
[1:39:20] and sometimes some of the words they say
[1:39:22] you'd been better off they've kept their
[1:39:23] mouth shut
[1:39:30] how did this man take it
[1:39:33] the absolute
[1:39:36] almighty god spoke to him in a rhema
[1:39:39] word
[1:39:41] and said do this
[1:39:43] and you will be just
[1:39:47] you remember reading in the first
[1:39:48] chapter how that the bible says that the
[1:39:50] sons and the daughters had gathered
[1:39:52] together at the eldest son's house and
[1:39:54] they drank wine and they were eating and
[1:39:55] job said per adventure my children
[1:39:59] might have done something wrong
[1:40:02] periadventure they might have said
[1:40:04] something wrong or they might have got
[1:40:05] carried away and they might have done
[1:40:07] something wrong against god
[1:40:10] and job applied the token
[1:40:12] to his house
[1:40:15] hallelujah don't give up on them
[1:40:17] children of yours
[1:40:18] or their waiver brother down in their
[1:40:19] backseat they may be now but it might be
[1:40:22] your faith that will move on their heart
[1:40:23] and bring them back in
[1:40:25] don't give up on them friends
[1:40:28] joel believed that god not only gave
[1:40:30] this to him but he believed he gave him
[1:40:32] his children
[1:40:36] you imagine as they come up
[1:40:39] and they sat down cross-legged as they
[1:40:40] would sit at that time
[1:40:42] and they just stared
[1:40:45] and stared
[1:40:47] and
[1:40:48] stared what is going to their mind
[1:40:52] this man
[1:40:53] is a sinner
[1:40:56] there's something wrong with him
[1:40:58] i always felt funny about him anyway
[1:41:02] i always knew there's something about
[1:41:04] him
[1:41:06] i hate that kind of discernment don't
[1:41:08] you
[1:41:15] but their testimony
[1:41:17] one matching gods
[1:41:20] you see when they went to criticizing
[1:41:22] job when they went to saying all these
[1:41:25] things against him every word they said
[1:41:28] against the percentage of job was
[1:41:30] blasphemy
[1:41:32] compared to what god said
[1:41:38] when things are going wrong for people
[1:41:42] be careful what you say
[1:41:44] it's easy for us to pass jeff oh there
[1:41:46] must be something wrong that person must
[1:41:47] be something wrong there must be
[1:41:49] something wrong with there may not be
[1:41:50] nothing wrong at all god may have done
[1:41:52] had a testimony meeting up here in
[1:41:53] heaven and they're fulfilling what god
[1:41:55] said about them
[1:41:57] well god
[1:41:58] god moved for this brother dawn
[1:42:00] and god healed this brother of coven and
[1:42:01] then god let this other one go on that's
[1:42:03] right and the same people prayed for
[1:42:05] both so you know what we have to do we
[1:42:07] have to commit it to the wisdom and the
[1:42:09] providence of god that apparently god
[1:42:10] wanted to heal this one and take this
[1:42:12] one home
[1:42:13] because the devil cannot do anything to
[1:42:15] us without permission from the hand of
[1:42:17] god
[1:42:18] do i understand where we are do i
[1:42:20] understand everything we're going
[1:42:22] through i do not but i know my father
[1:42:25] well enough to know he is not a god of
[1:42:28] chaos he is not a god of trouble he is
[1:42:31] not a god of confusion and i know the
[1:42:34] devil well enough to know he cannot take
[1:42:37] you our eye until our father is done
[1:42:40] with us and when god is done with me in
[1:42:42] life i'm finished with life
[1:42:50] let's stand
[1:42:55] don't worry we'll get old job took care
[1:42:56] of you just
[1:43:01] i love the way brother ram says this in
[1:43:03] page 13 then when he come to that spot
[1:43:06] when that absolute hell
[1:43:09] finally he begin to feel the string
[1:43:13] tighten up
[1:43:15] it's been running loose
[1:43:18] now so you'll understand the setting of
[1:43:20] this brother random had talked about
[1:43:22] a man that was walking down the street
[1:43:24] one day
[1:43:25] and he's seen a little boy with a string
[1:43:27] in his hand
[1:43:29] and the man asked the little boy sonny
[1:43:30] what are you doing
[1:43:32] he said i'm flying a kite
[1:43:35] well he said i can't see no kite he said
[1:43:38] well no i don't see it either he said
[1:43:39] how do you know it's there
[1:43:41] he said i feel the pool
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:43:49] and the string
[1:43:50] is tied to the absolute brother bam said
[1:43:52] so he identified the kite as being the
[1:43:54] absolute
[1:43:55] and the string is tied to the absolute
[1:43:58] so every now and then we feel a little
[1:44:01] tug
[1:44:02] aren't you glad you still feel the tug
[1:44:06] so i can't see it i don't know where
[1:44:08] it's at it's so far out of sight
[1:44:11] this is what had happened to job
[1:44:13] brother ben said he began to feel the
[1:44:15] string
[1:44:16] tighten up that had been running loose
[1:44:19] bouncing around
[1:44:20] and it began to tighten up and the
[1:44:22] spirit come on him
[1:44:23] and he stood up being a prophet and said
[1:44:26] i know
[1:44:28] my redeemer liveth
[1:44:31] he tightened up
[1:44:33] to his absolute
[1:44:36] he'd come
[1:44:37] in contact
[1:44:39] maybe the wind's friends in the last few
[1:44:41] weeks or months whatever it is
[1:44:43] has blowed around you you you don't feel
[1:44:46] that pull it's just exactly right the
[1:44:48] tension
[1:44:50] made the holy ghost come by this morning
[1:44:52] and let it tighten up a little bit
[1:44:55] oh i don't know about you sometimes i
[1:44:56] love to dance and shout but sometimes it
[1:44:59] does my heart so much good
[1:45:01] just to feel a little pull
[1:45:03] just a little tug sometimes it don't
[1:45:05] take nuts
[1:45:06] oh girl really god brother jimmy it
[1:45:08] don't take much just just a little
[1:45:09] something every now and then

[1:45:13] i don't see it i don't feel it i don't
[1:45:16] smell it i don't taste it but i know
[1:45:18] it's there why i still feel the pull
[1:45:21] on the string

[1:45:30] lord jesus
[1:45:33] oh father god

[1:46:07] has been under this
[1:46:08] demon of covet
[1:46:11] lord
[1:46:12] it's certainly not affected us the way
[1:46:14] it has
[1:46:15] others in many other places we know that
[1:46:17] but we have had our fair share of it
[1:46:20] even today brother tim and them unable
[1:46:22] to have service just out of precaution
