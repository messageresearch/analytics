[37:20] get where we need to be
[37:26] you know what y'all don't mind let's
[37:29] just read it
[37:31] Hebrews 10 and one for the law having a
[37:37] shadow of good things to come and not
[37:39] the very image of the things can never
[37:42] with those sacrifices which they offered
[37:44] year by year continually make the comers
[37:46] thereunto perfect for then will they not
[37:50] for them would they not have ceased to
[37:53] be offered because that the worshiper
[37:55] ones person have had no more conscious
[37:58] of sin but in those sacrifices there is
[38:01] a remembrance again made of sin every
[38:04] year for it is not possible that the
[38:07] blood of bulls and of goats to take away
[38:10] sins wherefore when ye coming into the
[38:14] the world ye said sacrifice and
[38:16] offerings that would is not but a body
[38:19] has now prepared me in burnt offerings
[38:22] and sacrifices for sin thou has has had
[38:26] no pleasure then said I know I come in
[38:30] the volume of the book it is written of
[38:32] me to do thy will O God above when he
[38:36] said sacrifice and offerings and burnt
[38:38] offerings and offerings for sin thou
[38:40] wood is not neither has pleasure therein
[38:43] which are offered by the law then said
[38:48] he lo I come to do thy will O God he
[38:51] taketh away the first that he may
[38:53] establish the second by the which will
[38:56] we are sanctified through the offering
[39:00] of the blood of the body of Jesus Christ
[39:02] once for all in every priest and of
[39:07] daily ministering and offering
[39:08] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[39:12] never take away sin but this man who is
[39:16] that man Jesus amen nobody else get the
[39:23] crack
[39:25] hallelujah nobody else get the credit
[39:27] for you being delivered from alcohol
[39:30] from lusts from line from denomination
[39:34] the only one gets the credit is this man
[39:37] Jesus Christ he did it what no it was no
[39:41] boy it wasn't a goat it wasn't a lamb
[39:44] it was the bloody lamb of the Cross
[39:46] Jesus Christ it was this man that we
[39:49] served today who you this man that died
[39:53] and rose again this man that week to sit
[39:56] on the right hand of the throne he know
[40:02] who I'm talking about
[40:04] but this man after he had offered one
[40:07] sacrifice for sin forever sat down on
[40:10] the right hand of God
[40:12] from his fourth expecting to his enemies
[40:15] be made his footstool for by one
[40:17] offering he has perfected forever them
[40:20] that are sanctified Church by the
[40:23] offering of Jesus Christ you spend
[40:25] perfect this morning that makes me want
[40:31] to shout hallelujah he says where the
[40:37] Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for
[40:41] after that he had said therefore I mean
[40:44] before this is the Covenant that I will
[40:47] make with them after those days saith
[40:50] the Lord I will put away I will put my
[40:52] laws into their hearts and in their
[40:55] minds will I write them and their sins
[40:58] and iniquities will I remember no more
[41:03] may the Lord are the blessing the
[41:05] reading of his word you can have your
[41:06] seats
[41:13] I think you can kind of tell where I'm
[41:15] going this morning you know I'm just a
[41:21] kind of preacher where you know I
[41:23] believe that we have to deal with seeing
[41:26] Amen we have to get you know singing
[41:30] things out of our lives a man because
[41:32] that's the only way God can put his hand
[41:34] on you he's not going to touch something
[41:36] that's filthy and unclean unless you
[41:39] confess Lord I don't want to be filthy
[41:41] and unclean but if you if you have
[41:44] things in your life and you continue to
[41:46] live that way with no open confession of
[41:49] deliverance you'll remain in that
[41:51] condition but once you confess how do
[41:54] that Jesus Christ is your Savior he is
[41:57] your Lord
[41:58] he is your deliverer that brings him on
[42:00] the scene huh
[42:02] to do what you can't do a man that makes
[42:05] him your advocate a man that makes him
[42:08] your deliverer that makes him your peace
[42:10] of mind the hallelujah that makes him a
[42:13] mighty God in your life amen
[42:16] so confession doesn't mean you're weak
[42:18] hallelujah but confession gives God the
[42:21] right to do something in your life and
[42:26] then before I get in my something I mean
[42:28] let's just deal with us a little bit you
[42:30] don't remember the woman that had
[42:32] committed adultery and and she was dying
[42:35] and she was a Sunday school teacher and
[42:37] she didn't know why she was dying it was
[42:39] because she had unconfessed sins in her
[42:41] life and the Bible says the wages of sin
[42:44] is death you know a lot of people think
[42:47] that they're getting away because they
[42:49] look at this one sitting and it looks
[42:51] like there are you don't know what
[42:52] they're going through before they close
[42:54] their eyes you don't know that they're
[42:56] people being tormented in their sleep
[42:58] they're taking sleeping pills and
[43:00] they're taking pills for depression and
[43:02] all these things because they have
[43:03] unconfessed sins in their life
[43:06] oh let me tell you something if you
[43:08] can't get a good night's sleep that's a
[43:10] demon the Bible said Jesus said come
[43:17] unto me and I will give you what rest so
[43:23] I challenge that spirit today
[43:25] oh that's affecting your street amen
[43:28] come on to me jesus said and I will give
[43:30] you rest
[43:32] let's get the unconfessed things out of
[43:35] the way so God can put his hands on you
[43:37] and you know she should come to the
[43:40] Providence she was saying she was dying
[43:42] and all these days and she didn't know
[43:44] why finally after several times meeting
[43:46] with the Prophet this one particular
[43:48] time he began to have a vision honey he
[43:51] says I see you in a car with a man of a
[43:53] certain color hair and you're riding
[43:55] down the road and you're almost hit by a
[43:56] train why was she screaming because her
[44:02] sins were being made known demons love
[44:09] to scream out when everybody to be cast
[44:11] out
[44:14] oh my I don't want to go into this today
[44:17] but this is just where I'm at hallelujah
[44:19] so obviously there's some spirits that
[44:21] need to be dealt with today man
[44:23] there's some unconfessed sins in the
[44:25] Church of have a valley that needs to be
[44:27] dealt with today cuz otherwise I
[44:29] wouldn't be preaching on it if it was
[44:31] covered by the brother so let's deal
[44:34] with your unconfessed chance let's deal
[44:36] with your depression let's see what your
[44:38] secrets let's deal with your lust let's
[44:40] deal with your lies so that God can put
[44:42] his hands on us
[44:47] and the only way God is gonna put his
[44:50] hands on us is if we invite him in
[44:53] because God is a lover he's not a brute
[44:56] hallelujah
[44:57] he don't just come in and force us he's
[44:59] giving us free more agency a right to
[45:02] choose and you have to choose the right
[45:06] thing today and you don't church
[45:08] hallelujah this woman she begin to cry
[45:13] but you can't hide your secrets from God
[45:16] [Applause]
[45:18] your sins will find you out and you know
[45:23] as she stood there and she's like please
[45:25] don't tell nobody long she's on the
[45:26] floor waddling and screaming in her sins
[45:29] it's just the media had to come in
[45:31] patter and she's telling brother Branham
[45:33] no you don't tell nobody this today he
[45:35] says well so sad indeed all I can do you
[45:37] need to go make that right he says I
[45:41] can't do nothing for you until you make
[45:43] that right also he saw the vision
[45:47] although he was a prophet although he
[45:49] had thus said the Lord because I do
[45:51] nothing as loogies are the best hints
[45:54] are there and let me tell you today God
[45:57] can't do nothing for you with
[46:00] unconfessed scenes in your life today
[46:06] hallelujah
[46:08] and you know what we think I don't need
[46:11] to infest do you want God in your life
[46:17] see Satan has rights and you know he has
[46:21] rights and this we have a right huh to
[46:24] walk in every open door of sin in your
[46:27] life and as long as those doors are open
[46:30] he has a right so I'm telling you today
[46:33] we have the ability in Jesus Christ to
[46:36] close those doors something you need to
[46:41] put your hand on the door and slam it in
[46:43] his face and say today I will confess
[46:46] today I will make it right today I will
[46:49] come under the blood hello yeah but you
[46:56] know when you start preaching like those
[46:57] people get nervous holy let me tell you
[47:00] something major judge hallelujah I'm
[47:02] just a messenger honey I'm just an agent
[47:05] a man and one thing I know that my
[47:07] policy is eternal it doesn't matter what
[47:12] church you go through the past the
[47:14] policy stays the same it doesn't matter
[47:16] how long you had this particular
[47:18] assurance it stays the same it doesn't
[47:21] matter who your agent is the policy
[47:23] remains the same oh yeah so you can run
[47:26] oh yeah but the Word of God will not
[47:28] change
[47:32] hallelujah and you know when we get into
[47:35] these areas and you say well brothers
[47:37] why you hitting us because remember it
[47:39] was a message the prophet of God was
[47:41] preaching he said the rapture should
[47:43] have been taking place and you look what
[47:49] we had today we're in such a place what
[47:52] we have we have a president who's so
[47:56] comical I just go to look to see what
[47:57] he's saying so I can give me a good
[47:58] laugh I know some of you you kind of
[48:05] touchy in all this stuff who cares who
[48:09] cares who the president is the Bible
[48:12] says by this man hallelujah we are saved
[48:15] Jesus Christ by this man we are
[48:18] delivered but this man we have joy I
[48:20] don't care who they let in office he's
[48:23] all working for my good they're gonna
[48:28] like the Chinese man it wouldn't bother
[48:30] me none cuz I got a promise a man oh
[48:36] yeah that I will see him when he comes
[48:39] cuz I will be like him so politics
[48:44] doesn't change who I am
[48:49] oh I'm a Jesus Christ supporter but you
[49:05] know can't you tell it's God's choosing
[49:08] to have a man in office that nobody
[49:11] can't control they can't control it you
[49:17] know why because he's a businessman and
[49:22] the country is like to him running a
[49:25] business he don't care who's under his
[49:29] staff
[49:29] if you don't run his business the way he
[49:31] wants you're fired it's just like a
[49:35] business and Congress can't control him
[49:39] you know the Democrats and whatever else
[49:42] cracks or whatever all they got came
[49:44] none of them control him and I want you
[49:46] to understand this God allowed him to
[49:49] get there because God has a plan God is
[49:54] up to something amen and it's time for
[49:56] us to stop worrying about what the world
[49:58] is doing and look at the prophecies
[50:00] that's being fulfilled oh yeah
[50:06] don't you understand that under a bush
[50:08] prophecy was fulfilled
[50:10] I know bomber prophecy was fulfilled and
[50:13] you thinking under this this new
[50:15] administration that prophecy is not
[50:17] gonna be fulfilled it's being fulfilled
[50:20] [Applause]
[50:23] let's get our feelings out the way and
[50:28] let's stand on that foundation you know
[50:32] what you know what I love about no
[50:33] matter who gets in office I know what
[50:35] you're gonna do before you do it because
[50:37] God sent me a prophet
[50:41] hallelujah but you don't judge when we
[50:44] start to get down these areas and that
[50:46] we're in a time we're in a time now
[50:48] where you have to make your calling and
[50:50] election sure you're not in the time
[50:53] where being a church member is good
[50:55] enough you're not in a time where just
[50:58] knowing the quotes and normal brother
[50:59] branham said it's good enough you're not
[51:02] at a time just hallelujah being under a
[51:04] good ministry is good enough no you got
[51:07] to get to a place where you know you're
[51:09] under the blood of Jesus Christ now
[51:15] let's get into the thought earlier today
[51:19] my subject is covenant people
[51:21] oh yeah and you know God is a God of
[51:24] covenant honey he loves to give us a
[51:27] covenant but I want you to understand
[51:30] the only one that's under conditions is
[51:33] God we're not under conditions our
[51:38] company this unconditional but for God
[51:41] to give us a covenant there's certain
[51:43] things he has to do oh yeah there's
[51:47] certain things he's obligated to and
[51:49] what is it his words oh yeah
[51:52] God is obligated to his word though the
[51:55] Covenant for us is unconditional for God
[51:58] he's hold it to his word to you by the
[52:01] church honey when it comes to God's Word
[52:03] we can tie his hands we can put God in
[52:07] handcuffs we didn't come to God at all
[52:09] no you said over here in your world so
[52:14] you have the power you have the ability
[52:17] to make God operate according to what he
[52:20] said
[52:22] holy when you and I can say something
[52:25] you and I can make mistakes and God will
[52:27] look past it because our covenant is
[52:32] unconditional
[52:32] but with him he's holding to it
[52:37] he can't say I didn't mean to say that
[52:39] oh yes you did
[52:42] you told me I was the head and not the
[52:44] tail so when I get in tight spots all I
[52:48] gotta do is believe that hallelujah
[52:50] according to what God say you said by
[52:53] spikes I'm healed I can't get into a
[52:58] fourth stage cancer and then God says oh
[53:01] that's too much for me oh no you said I
[53:04] was healed see God is obligated to his
[53:10] words you know in times where I feel a
[53:15] little down and out and I don't know
[53:17] which way I'm going and in the scripture
[53:19] calls the says let the weak say I'm
[53:21] strong and the devil will come and say
[53:22] well that's not for you and I say oh no
[53:26] God says that the weak say I'm strong
[53:30] and God said in my weakness did I am a
[53:33] spell see the key to the message of this
[53:43] hour is knowing your word and living
[53:49] your word it can't just be up here oh
[53:53] yeah let's get into it
[53:55] when we looked and we see the scripture
[53:57] that from the earth from its earlier at
[54:00] the times of Noah God gave a covenant
[54:03] you know he destroyed the earth and then
[54:07] he came and he floods the earth and then
[54:10] God put a rainbow in the sky and that
[54:13] rainbow color was a covenant that God
[54:16] says I never destroyed the world by
[54:19] water again cuz how often do you see a
[54:22] rainbow almost every time it rains so
[54:27] that means that covenant is still
[54:29] standing and as long as you recognize
[54:31] that covenant you are a covenant people
[54:33] hallelujah and we're living by what God
[54:36] said hey man but you know as it goes on
[54:38] and on and and then we backtrack a
[54:40] little bit more from there you know Adam
[54:43] and Eve hey man they say they broke the
[54:45] first covenant between them and God they
[54:47] meant that they should not touch the
[54:49] tree of knowledge of good and evil that
[54:51] was in the gods and they broke the
[54:53] covenant with God
[54:55] so Richard mercy he made a way for us to
[54:58] get back earlier he made a way for us to
[55:03] be a covenant people a man and his or
[55:05] covenant deals with a promise God keeps
[55:12] his promises
[55:14] [Applause]
[55:15] like we will say it last night if you're
[55:17] going through any trouble look the devil
[55:19] cannot sneak up on God gotcha no can't
[55:31] do that car
[55:32] you ever see those people play practical
[55:34] jokes and they jump out on somebody's
[55:36] life well let me give you a stretch to
[55:40] how that happens with God in the devil
[55:42] Satan loves to try to sneak up on guys
[55:47] he's it ah let me play games with God
[55:58] you're gonna play jokes with God because
[56:01] he's waiting to bless you any demon
[56:05] devil any situation the enemy cannot
[56:08] sneak up on God God is ready for him
[56:12] and I'll tell you nine times out of ten
[56:15] we tries to sneak up he's gonna get more
[56:17] than what he bargains for
[56:21] you know people that that have
[56:23] interesting I was just playing why are

[56:26] don't play with me like that don't you
[56:29] know that I'm up nipple tints I'm all
[56:31] power hallelujah and that God gives in
[56:39] you
[56:41] when Satan sneaks up you need to stop
[56:44] being afraid
[56:44] hallelujah he sneaks up on you say boo
[56:47] you need to say boo boo you devil I
[56:52] got God on my side I am a covenant
[56:55] people they may you know trust when we
[56:57] look at this covenant that God I don't
[56:59] want to be long I'm about to close y'all
[57:04] know I said because those words got
[57:05] power I'm about to close got power
[57:13] there'll be people like Bill Lewis

[57:50] help you out I'm about to close but you
[57:58] know Church distance covenant that God
[58:00] gains from the beginning I mean he
[58:02] wanted him to take an animal and and
[58:04] take the blood of that animal and offer
[58:06] a sacrifice earlier because he said when
[58:09] I see the blood I'll pass over you a man
[58:12] hug now in that covenant hallelujah that
[58:15] that blood Hurley was there to admit see
[58:18] in fact that particular time it didn't
[58:20] remit desire hallelujah that's why I'm
[58:27] so grateful we're not under that
[58:30] covenant anymore
[58:31] [Applause]
[58:34] now that covenant was under the law that
[58:36] does not mean we don't need at all
[58:40] because now we wanna church people who
[58:42] says I can do whatever I wanna do I'm
[58:44] under grace no he said I did not come to
[58:49] take away the law but I came to magnify
[58:52] the law so now under the law huh it's
[58:56] not just you taking a woman and sleeping
[58:58] with is she doing it through your eyes
[58:59] oh my are you doing it through your
[59:06] fault oh yeah see now the law is
[59:09] magnified hallelujah is not something
[59:11] that you can just keep with your own
[59:13] human ability but it has to be a part of
[59:16] who you are to keep this long see people

[59:32] just sick of being judged well if you're
[59:39] sick of being judged you sick of the
[59:40] judge because the only judge is the Word
[59:45] of God I ain't your judge but if I tell
[59:49] you what the word say you ain't mad at
[59:51] me you mad at the world
[59:55] hallelujah you know it's like me and one
[59:57] of my friends that denomination of good

[1:00:08] that church and all this stuff the issue
[1:00:10] of pants come up and you know and we got
[1:00:14] to talking by the mirror and my wife and
[1:00:16] her husband all we got talking about
[1:00:17] pants and all those things and and you
[1:00:19] know she was time up his pants the issue
[1:00:21] and so many other different things and
[1:00:23] she said brother we're under a new
[1:00:24] covenant we are the new covenant so that
[1:00:30] covenant does not give you the right to
[1:00:31] take away the law because you believe
[1:00:35] that you're under grace but the Bible
[1:00:37] says the law is a schoolmaster so the
[1:00:40] Holy Ghost comes public and you notice
[1:00:43] how God does things her lujah
[1:00:44] sanctification didn't take away
[1:00:46] justification oh yeah and the baptism of
[1:00:50] the Holy Ghost didn't take away
[1:00:51] hallelujah Saints vacation amen
[1:00:53] but it all made one whole look so my
[1:00:57] illustration to them was I said hey you
[1:01:00] can't just take the oh she said I bet
[1:01:02] you that's in the whole tesla's I know
[1:01:03] you ain't just old test me because he's
[1:01:05] you know how God says for a woman away
[1:01:07] plants is an abomination and you know
[1:01:10] she said I bet yesterday I bet that's an
[1:01:12] old-time say yeah but Paul said women
[1:01:14] when you dressed dressed as - apparel
[1:01:16] hallelujah
[1:01:18] oh boy y'all tightening up on me I feel
[1:01:24] like brother Donna we got to get them a
[1:01:25] man thing to a man tanks going up in
[1:01:27] here come on children
[1:01:34] but you know church hallelujah we begin
[1:01:36] to talk about that and sometimes you say
[1:01:38] well I bet that was under the law the
[1:01:39] Old Testament I said look here I said
[1:01:42] looking here if you take a loan for
[1:01:43] brand and you cut off the back part and
[1:01:47] I cut off the front part eating all of
[1:01:49] the bread she says yes I said but you
[1:01:55] think about it like this when that loaf
[1:01:57] of bread was bought it was all brand
[1:01:59] whether it was cut this way of cutting
[1:02:01] that way huh it was all bread so the Old
[1:02:04] Testament is brand the new test is bread
[1:02:06] and you put it together is bread I love
[1:02:09] it comes from the same place huh so you
[1:02:11] can't take this part of the bread and
[1:02:13] say it's not bread oh I don't need this
[1:02:14] limo if you get hungry enough you gonna
[1:02:17] eat that bread it doesn't matter when it
[1:02:22] hits the front part that all of us like
[1:02:24] the gold pants
[1:02:25] it's still bread but I guarantee you get
[1:02:28] hungry enough
[1:02:28] you take that front piece toasted put
[1:02:31] ball over to eat it just like the back
[1:02:33] piece why because it's right
[1:02:39] and you know church under that under
[1:02:42] that particular situation we were just
[1:02:45] saying that look you can't take this
[1:02:47] part of the world and say it's not words
[1:02:49] you can take this quote and say it's not
[1:02:52] words you can take that point and say it
[1:02:54] is worth all of it makes up Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] [Applause]
[1:03:02] you know how some people who want
[1:03:04] brother Branham saying I'm just trying
[1:03:11] to serve a God who Lia of yesterday but
[1:03:16] the garden yesterday is the god of today
[1:03:19] haruya in the garden tomorrow is the god
[1:03:22] of today and yesterday hallelujah
[1:03:25] so choice we have to look at the Word of
[1:03:28] God and think about it like this honey
[1:03:30] it never gets old it never gets stale it
[1:03:38] never gets bold on hallelujah it's
[1:03:41] always ready to fix for you but you know
[1:03:48] under that sacrifice of animal blood
[1:03:51] they was the priest was coming how do
[1:03:53] you you had to see this I think this
[1:03:56] sometimes what we miss out is that when
[1:03:58] you sin you had to get your own
[1:04:00] sacrifice the priest didn't find the
[1:04:05] sacrifice for you know you had to get
[1:04:08] your lamb or your gold or whatever you
[1:04:09] know you got in that time halu you had
[1:04:12] to get and you had to bring it to church
[1:04:16] oh wow
[1:04:19] cuz that was the Covenant you was under
[1:04:21] you didn't come to church without a
[1:04:23] sacrifice over your life oh yeah but you
[1:04:27] know they brought the sacrifice in had
[1:04:29] to be a sacrifice without blemish
[1:04:32] because have look imperfections in it
[1:04:35] couldn't have little happy silly you
[1:04:37] know I just can't stop watching this old
[1:04:39] TV you know I just like looking at the
[1:04:41] boys blow me away people watch that
[1:04:46] stuff do y'all realize they sing
[1:04:48] inwardly Souls no matter how good they
[1:04:52] voice is you ain't doing me no good cuz
[1:04:54] I ain't singing about Jesus but that's
[1:05:04] under the Old Covenant well you can come
[1:05:08] to church and still live out your own
[1:05:10] fleshly desires you still sit home and
[1:05:14] watch scandal still sit home and watch
[1:05:18] Housewives of Dallas or housewives on
[1:05:22] Johnson City
[1:05:25] whatever soul cuz you live by your
[1:05:31] desires your own worldly desires under
[1:05:34] that sacrifice under that covenant but
[1:05:36] you know what God allowed that but the
[1:05:41] Bible says hundred that those things
[1:05:43] were a shadow of what was to come
[1:05:47] this will be a sacrifice that cause that
[1:05:49] totally an idealised the human desire we
[1:05:56] get into something real good huh
[1:06:00] it might wake you up dance dance dance
[1:06:02] all night oh yeah cuz you know the Word
[1:06:09] of God and you know having said it to
[1:06:10] myself the Word of God does not separate
[1:06:13] families but the Word of God brings us
[1:06:16] together if we can receive it the reason
[1:06:22] why it tears up families is because
[1:06:24] somebody is not receiving it but you
[1:06:31] know today today today today the
[1:06:33] worshiper had to get that sacrifice Amen
[1:06:36] he had to come how do you raise the
[1:06:38] church and you know the sacrifice had to
[1:06:40] be a willing sacrifice honey see it

[1:06:46] to play you say Oh help me I need livers
[1:06:50] I just take it over this pornography

[1:06:55] judge know it's a willful sacrifice
[1:06:59] [Applause]
[1:07:01] that's why he said he's the Lamb of God
[1:07:03] not the goal of God not the pool of God
[1:07:07] not the kaolian God but the Lamb of God
[1:07:11] because a lamb will willfully surrender
[1:07:15] his life y'all wonder why I'm walking

[1:08:00] it to the church you know he didn't have
[1:08:01] to have some she didn't have to have no
[1:08:03] gorilla grip on that sacrifice so it's
[1:08:07] so I couldn't get away
[1:08:08] we're gonna turn God know what none of
[1:08:13] that it was a willful sacrifice you'll
[1:08:16] bring it in tight say hello I'm gonna

[1:08:22] day cuz I got the sacrifice and I'm

[1:09:52] mysterious about that that's just
[1:09:53] something simple simple lie the devil is
[1:09:56] told that's why the bottles do you read
[1:09:58] your Bible you understand why God said
[1:09:59] certain things he said if you gonna cut
[1:10:01] it shave it off ball why ball because
[1:10:06] that's the only way it's gonna grow back
[1:10:07] it grows back from the root not from the
[1:10:09] spleens
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:17] when you cut it off right here it don't

[1:11:12] you take that sacrifice and give it to
[1:11:14] the priest and he's examining a man and
[1:11:17] make sure is fit to go only out and once
[1:11:23] they got to the priests it had nothing
[1:11:24] else to do with the worship ah huh
[1:11:26] because you gave it to the priest and
[1:11:28] now it has to be offered unto God but
[1:11:31] your sacrifice wouldn't fit the priest

[1:11:34] something mr. sing good enough and
[1:11:37] that's what's happening a lot of people
[1:11:38] are offering up other gods they offered
[1:11:42] up other sacrifices
[1:11:44] that's not fit for deliverance and
[1:11:48] that's why you find us abound with the
[1:11:49] same old things earlier bound with the
[1:11:52] same old demons yeah I just got to let

[1:12:17] spirits no as a man I am not able with
[1:12:23] the Holy Ghost inside that's what the
[1:12:26] demons recognize huh they recognize
[1:12:28] what's behind that veil that's why when
[1:12:32] Jesus went on the other side and there
[1:12:34] was a legion of demons there huh and
[1:12:36] they was used to tormenting people amen
[1:12:38] just family ran out they said whoa and

[1:16:21] today just did you how to profit God say
[1:16:23] when you've heard from your theophany
[1:16:29] and we hear it all the time we just
[1:16:32] don't realize let me ask you a question
[1:16:36] what's making you say Amen this morning
[1:16:43] ain't necessarily the revelation now
[1:16:46] it's something greater than that it's
[1:16:49] your representation
[1:16:53] it's your word body in another dimension
[1:16:56] hey man say hey pterri pterri
[1:16:59] well I'm preaching huh it may be way
[1:17:01] back here by Sister Sister Tabitha
[1:17:05] but Dean hallelujah but the terrorists
[1:17:07] theophany starts to recognize that he's
[1:17:09] talking to them so as the world is being
[1:17:12] preached and he begins to get closer and
[1:17:14] closer to brother Terry and as the world
[1:17:17] is preaching he comes in brother Terry
[1:17:18] here he says save me hey that's what's
[1:17:25] happening to each and every one of us
[1:17:27] it's our representation from heaven
[1:17:29] making us say hey man to the world
[1:17:36] hallelujah and what does a man me hey
[1:17:40] man means Soviet are you bright Soviet
[1:17:52] are you blessed so be it are you a son
[1:17:58] or daughter
[1:18:00] Soviet that means whatever the word is
[1:18:05] saying to me in this moment if you say
[1:18:07] Amen you're saying I receive
[1:18:10] [Applause]
[1:18:18] but you look at that sacrifice no no I
[1:18:21] don't be in and out issue pool but
[1:18:24] you're looking at sacrificing out a
[1:18:25] precess that's sacrificing he's
[1:18:27] examining it and everything and then he
[1:18:29] offers it up once a year once a year but
[1:18:33] that person that worshipper he would
[1:18:36] give that sacrifice and if he gave it
[1:18:37] because he committed adultery he went
[1:18:39] away with the same desire that's the
[1:18:43] Covenant they won yeah this is were
[1:18:46] forgiven for that year but they went
[1:18:50] away with the same desire you know they
[1:18:54] were saying he going away if he
[1:18:55] committed adultery I thought oh boy I
[1:18:57] think God God he forgave me but did
[1:19:05] blaspheme Jesus because that desire
[1:19:11] still there yeah he offers a sacrifice
[1:19:14] but the sacrifice wasn't good enough to
[1:19:17] change his heart the sacrifice wasn't
[1:19:21] good enough to change his life although
[1:19:26] they were forgiven but it did not
[1:19:28] produce a change and let's look at a
[1:19:31] little deeper what if you all we all
[1:19:33] were under that sacrifice today and you
[1:19:36] brought your sacrifice to brother
[1:19:37] Donnie's brother Danny oh brother Danny
[1:19:39] I thought evil thoughts it oh please
[1:19:42] just offer this sacrifice for me and it
[1:19:45] did Church all of a sudden brother Donna
[1:19:47] gets an email he forgets about your
[1:19:48] sacrifice sacrifice to do their did he
[1:19:53] gets a text and he forgets about you
[1:19:55] even more do you get a call from you
[1:20:01] just forget all about your sacrifice
[1:20:04] what has happened to you you're still
[1:20:08] living in because you put your life in
[1:20:14] the hands of another man that's why I'm
[1:20:22] so glad hallelujah it doesn't matter
[1:20:25] what kind of life brother branham lives
[1:20:28] earlier that does not determine my
[1:20:30] eternal destination it doesn't matter to
[1:20:39] me whether he got a caribou or silver
[1:20:41] temple he got a blackberry with the
[1:20:43] India Africa none of that has to do with
[1:20:46] my eternal destination
[1:20:51] it doesn't matter to me whether they got
[1:20:53] witnesses of a breeze and they got
[1:20:55] witnesses of the witnesses of that that
[1:20:57] does not defeat my eternal destination
[1:21:03] it doesn't matter to me when they can
[1:21:06] prove he was there in Arizona whether he
[1:21:08] wasn't there that does not determine my
[1:21:11] eternal destination you know what
[1:21:21] because I'm not majoring on a minor did
[1:21:29] not something we can use our very own
[1:21:31] message to defend ourselves
[1:21:34] oh the cloud brother Brenda wasn't there
[1:21:38] is oh the Tilson over that and oh he
[1:21:42] didn't get the black bear and oh this

[1:24:31] and you know what he told me how do you

[1:24:37] I got ain't even mine it came from him
[1:24:40] [Applause]
[1:24:45] brother Brendan's message this message
[1:24:49] table Jesus came from God the Father but
[1:25:02] you know Church they take that sacrifice
[1:25:03] I'm so glad we're not under that because
[1:25:06] under that sacrifice you can be
[1:25:08] controlled by your own nesting nature
[1:25:14] you come to church pay your tithes
[1:25:17] listen to the preacher smile laugh when
[1:25:20] you're supposed to and walk out with the
[1:25:21] same desires under that covenant but
[1:25:25] then the Bible says earlier he said
[1:25:27] Jesus was looking at us as his children
[1:25:30] he's looking at us
[1:25:31] in the 20th century and he said you know
[1:25:33] what before they're even born I'm gonna
[1:25:36] make a way that they don't have to go
[1:25:37] through this nonsense though the god he
[1:25:45] said I'm gonna make a way that they
[1:25:46] don't ever have to go through that that
[1:25:48] when they act 4 delivers it's gonna be
[1:25:51] right there in their mouth
[1:25:54] so he says you know what i'ma do I'm
[1:25:56] gonna take away the first to establish
[1:25:57] the second I'm gonna take away the first
[1:26:00] sacrifice hardly the first covenant name
[1:26:03] it and I'm gonna give him a new color
[1:26:08] and you know Church hallelujah by him
[1:26:10] giving us a new covenant he had to give
[1:26:12] up something he had to give up his role
[1:26:15] he had to give up all his prestige he
[1:26:17] had to give up all this power everything
[1:26:19] that he was why because there was
[1:26:21] something else he was trying to achieve
[1:26:23] there was something else that he'd
[1:26:25] rather to receive did not live with that
[1:26:30] that's why I blows me away Billa Harry
[1:26:33] you didn't want heaven without us
[1:26:37] so geez are you my scene was great your
[1:26:47] love was great
[1:26:50] tell me can't stand against me now
[1:26:57] [Applause]
[1:27:04] wonderful name you know wonderful means
[1:27:16] excellent think about that he's the god
[1:27:21] of the adjectives
[1:27:22] I don't just call him Lord I will just
[1:27:26] call him god I caught up with an
[1:27:28] additive infront I call him great God
[1:27:32] wonderful God awesome God powerful God
[1:27:37] loving God see we just can't talk about
[1:27:41] and we got to put something in front of
[1:27:43] it
[1:27:44] I I gotta come out to close I'm just
[1:27:49] having to understand such a good listen
[1:27:54] listen see that the blood of bulls and
[1:27:57] goats couldn't change our life it was
[1:28:01] there for a period of time it could
[1:28:03] change something for that movement but
[1:28:06] according to your eternal that snakes it
[1:28:07] couldn't help you you want you came away
[1:28:10] all the sacrifice for your sins you were
[1:28:11] covered by the blood but you went away
[1:28:13] with the same sinful nature you know
[1:28:18] what because just like the prophecies in
[1:28:21] the Bible says that the nature of that
[1:28:23] animal the blood of that animal couldn't
[1:28:25] connect I was in New Zealand last year
[1:28:30] and I made an atheist at some meetings
[1:28:34] he said he didn't believe my testimony
[1:28:38] [Laughter]
[1:28:43] Wow
[1:28:46] didn't believe my testimony you know I
[1:28:49] did when you told me that Brian I'm
[1:28:56] gonna tell you about it and you know
[1:29:00] what his sister came in and we were
[1:29:03] sitting down eating it you know I'm
[1:29:04] trying to close he was signaling we were
[1:29:07] eating and different things and she
[1:29:08] comes in and she says brother take some
[1:29:10] when you were here from cancer this and
[1:29:12] that this and that this Annette and so I
[1:29:14] started telling her this medicine and
[1:29:15] she look at me confused
[1:29:16] I said what's the problem she said well
[1:29:18] when this happen did that happen how
[1:29:20] does this happen
[1:29:20] I said what's the problem she said well
[1:29:22] I'm confused I said you know why because
[1:29:24] it's not your testimony it's mine you
[1:29:31] can't tell my story like I can
[1:29:35] so if you see somebody shouting and
[1:29:37] dancing in church don't you criticize
[1:29:39] you don't know what they going for you
[1:29:44] see somebody crying and lifting their
[1:29:45] hands and worshiping God don't you judge
[1:29:48] them you don't know what God doing in a
[1:29:50] life you can't gentle by the story like
[1:29:53] they came and sometimes in church I get
[1:29:59] like a wild stay and I start bucking cuz
[1:30:05] you know one thing about a wild stallion
[1:30:06] he's free
[1:30:10] here you got no beat in his mouth he got
[1:30:13] a little on the side
[1:30:14] he got no saddle on his back he's free
[1:30:16] and when you trying to hold him down
[1:30:18] with your dachshund he's home now
[1:30:22] I'm free in Jesus some of y'all need to
[1:30:27] buck you out way to freedom

[1:32:18] devil I say just still cuz I see demons
[1:32:27] do that all the time they try to hide
[1:32:30] they know it's gonna be cast out so they
[1:32:31] jump into the emotional room and they
[1:32:34] start crying and y'all the demons can
[1:32:35] cry behind and just I can't speak it
[1:32:41] because the devil don't want you to
[1:32:42] speak your deliverance
[1:32:46] if you don't come out so mal he still
[1:32:49] got a grip on you remember that when I

[1:40:43] turn this young man a man he began to
[1:40:45] tell me I say I said just tell me
[1:40:47] plainly what happened he says well I
[1:40:49] said what caused a big bass as well
[1:40:51] nitrogen oxygen the earth he says a
[1:41:00] planet and a star you see those three
[1:41:02] elements called the Big Bang
[1:41:04] you with me type of not just your oxygen
[1:41:07] planet in the star I'll say that cause
[1:41:09] Big Bang this is yes
[1:41:12] I said okay that's not plan it in a star
[1:41:16] this is yes that cost the Big Bang hmm
[1:41:20] and on the table was some a bottle water
[1:41:23] I said was your water he says yes so I
[1:41:27] take the top off I start pulling it out
[1:41:33] that means pulling out everybody by this
[1:41:35] time we got an audience people on my
[1:41:39] side and people in church on his side
[1:41:43] cuz you know you got people looking to
[1:41:45] find some error in this truth so they
[1:41:48] can walk away cuz then convert it so
[1:41:51] they waiting on I told you so three
[1:41:54] times I'm outta here
[1:41:56] they waiting on that so you know that
[1:41:59] the people on my side every time I do
[1:42:01] this they don't brother Dave
[1:42:05] [Applause]
[1:42:08] so I'm pulling the water out I'm looking
[1:42:17] Debbie a woman
[1:42:19] yes saying then happening he says what
[1:42:24] do you mean I said you told me three
[1:42:25] elements called the Big Bang he said yes
[1:42:27] I said well this this water is how did
[1:42:32] you the smartest person in the world but
[1:42:37] h2o
[1:42:40] how did you what that was one of these
[1:42:46] elements oh my god is so good I say dick
[1:42:52] who you hiding the oxygen this is yes
[1:42:55] the Sun was shining I said that's the
[1:42:58] greatest star ever created every other
[1:43:01] star comes from those two of these
[1:43:07] elements coexisting together he says
[1:43:10] also a planet we are on the planet Earth
[1:43:13] I said all three of your elements are
[1:43:17] coexisting again and ain't nothing
[1:43:20] happening so what you believe is a lie
[1:43:32] it's just a theory but what I believe I
[1:43:37] got proof
[1:43:39] I once was sick but now I'm healed I
[1:43:41] once was lost but now I'm saying I once
[1:43:44] was blind but now I see in the name of
[1:43:47] Jesus Christ you know why because I'm
[1:43:49] under the right sacrifice as I come down
[1:43:55] to coal is what the prophet god says he
[1:43:56] says no matter how good you are
[1:43:58] how much you say you're a believer God
[1:44:02] requires the token he requires in Egypt
[1:44:05] he requires it tonight he requires it
[1:44:07] tonight
[1:44:08] still the token is just as much required
[1:44:11] in this age as it was in that age I
[1:44:14] don't care if you was a Bible student oh
[1:44:17] yeah how well you can explain the
[1:44:19] scriptures Satan can do the same thing
[1:44:23] but remember that has nothing to do with
[1:44:27] it God requires one thing that's the
[1:44:30] token the token shows that you are
[1:44:33] identified with your sacrifice that's
[1:44:43] why it couldn't be animal blood so one
[1:44:46] day there was a baby born in the manger
[1:44:49] earlier they had nothing to do with Mary
[1:44:52] and Joseph it was all God brother
[1:44:54] branham saying even God created the egg
[1:44:57] that was in jaws that was in Mary
[1:44:59] he said because she had to have a desire
[1:45:01] for a man to create an egg so God made
[1:45:04] sure he got to it before Joseph dear God
[1:45:10] all this in your message now
[1:45:15] catch all day I love the message I ain't
[1:45:19] reading it on the paper but I'm reading
[1:45:21] off my heart huh
[1:45:26] so Jesus said you know what i'ma break
[1:45:28] this chain of them offering up
[1:45:30] sacrifices and remaining the same I'm
[1:45:33] gonna put them under the New Covenant
[1:45:34] hallelujah I will make them a covenant
[1:45:37] people of power I will make them uncover
[1:45:39] the people of deliverance I'm gonna make
[1:45:42] them accompany people of healing of joy
[1:45:44] a piece of business
[1:45:46] hallelujah I will give them a covenant
[1:45:49] that identifies Who I am
[1:45:53] so from now on when we say we're under
[1:45:55] the blood we're not talking about that
[1:45:57] blood that came out under Egypt we're
[1:46:00] not talking about that blood earlier
[1:46:02] this blood hunger is the blood of a life
[1:46:06] real with the blood of Jesus Christ it
[1:46:09] changed our lives hallelujah
[1:46:11] just coming in a man this covenant stops
[1:46:14] us from sealing a man just coming to
[1:46:17] change our nature a man just come to
[1:46:19] change our talk I won't it changed
[1:46:21] everything about us
[1:46:24] so are you under the blood today see the
[1:46:31] blood has to be more than just a
[1:46:32] chemistry remember the benefits of token
[1:46:34] he said has to be more than just a
[1:46:36] chemistry a marriage won't last with
[1:46:38] just a good chemistry it has to be a
[1:46:41] sacrifice in life huh that man has to
[1:46:45] give for that woman and that woman has
[1:46:47] to give for that man hey man it has to
[1:46:49] be equal a man it has to be her coverlet

[1:47:01] life about the clothes

[1:51:11] branham saying Jesus defeated the enemy
[1:51:14] simply by knowing who he was and in my
[1:51:22] closing earlier under the sacrifice of
[1:51:25] the blood of Jesus it's not just a
[1:51:28] little blood Danny enough to go around
[1:51:31] but it's a life oh yeah not just the
[1:51:36] chemistry but a life when we say we're
[1:51:39] under the blower under the sacrifice
[1:51:41] we're under the life of Christ what did
[1:51:44] he give us he gave us his life that's
[1:51:47] the public we're under we have his life
[1:51:49] a man we identified with his life the
[1:51:53] probably God said oh that was in God he
[1:51:56] poured into Christ oh that was in Christ
[1:51:58] where is it now
[1:51:59] he poured into the church somebody say
[1:52:02] me
[1:52:03] somebody say I got
[1:52:07] [Applause]
[1:52:08] and you know if you oh boy here come
[1:52:12] like brother will say here it is don't
[1:52:18] miss it now charge when you're
[1:52:21] identified with the sacrifice you're
[1:52:23] identified with the life and all that
[1:52:26] was in that life is in you now all the
[1:52:33] power in you all the healing in you all
[1:52:39] the joy in you all the peace in you all
[1:52:43] the authority in you everything that's
[1:52:46] in that sacrifice is now come back upon
[1:52:49] the believer here in the church and when
[1:52:58] you identify with this sacrifice
[1:53:00] everything that was in that life is now
[1:53:02] in the believer what a powerful name it
[1:53:10] is so now nothing that song has a
[1:53:16] different meaning you have no rivals you
[1:53:23] have no equals cuz where's Jesus he's in
[1:53:36] us so you have no rivals you have no
[1:53:40] equals you know why because Pais lives
[1:53:43] in you see that's a little too heavy for
[1:53:47] some of you are you taking away from
[1:53:49] what he was dead no I ain't he came to
[1:53:54] show us that we are children come on
[1:53:58] musicians I'm closing
[1:54:03] and if you are the son of a king
[1:54:05] everything in that Kingdom also belongs
[1:54:09] to you and if you got his but you got
[1:54:16] his DNA
[1:54:18] you got his makeup
[1:54:21] can you imagine Superman having a child
[1:54:24] what would it be Superboy he grew up to
[1:54:30] be a what a Superman are you with me
[1:54:33] well let's make it real simple Apple's
[1:54:37] produce apples can I get a you me or
[1:54:42] just produce oranges he goes put those
[1:54:45] Eagles liars for those Lions in God I
[1:54:52] [Applause]
[1:54:54] don't think that one click so let's do
[1:54:59] it again
[1:55:00] dogs produce dogs pitbull have another
[1:55:05] pitbull same makeup same lock jaws
[1:55:08] everything even put those Eagles same
[1:55:12] power in the car everything line for
[1:55:15] those Lions king of the beasts it has
[1:55:17] the same makeup same nature everything
[1:55:19] because it comes from a lion a man who
[1:55:22] your horses produce horses a man same
[1:55:25] strength same power same ability to run
[1:55:28] all of that comes from the life of the
[1:55:30] seed a man or just produce oranges
[1:55:36] apples apples pulse plums bananas
[1:55:41] bananas avocados avocados and God
[1:55:57] see I don't think you quite catching it
[1:56:00] because when I say in God I'm talking
[1:56:04] about you he didn't just produce another
[1:56:11] cadre dekes he produced a son he didn't
[1:56:20] just produce another Donnie Reagan he
[1:56:22] produced a son is everything how can you
[1:56:27] say that because none of us are alike
[1:56:30] there never be another Jesus there's
[1:56:34] only one so he had to make a me an army
[1:56:38] of his hope and we are that army we are
[1:56:44] the covenant people so when you take on
[1:56:47] the blood of Jesus Christ you take on
[1:56:49] the life of Christ and all that he is
[1:56:54] it's in his church so you ought not to
[1:56:59] walk out of here today with a negative
[1:57:00] testimony hallelujah you are to walk out
[1:57:03] here saying I'm a son I'm a daughter I'm
[1:57:07] a covenant oh yeah I'm the covenant I'm
[1:57:13] the church you're the reason why he went
[1:57:15] to the cross you're the reason why his
[1:57:20] blood said because he could not live
[1:57:22] without you that's especially somebody
[1:57:27] need to say I'm special oh yeah so when
[1:57:35] we think about being under the blood
[1:57:36] it's not just for us to say oh I'm under
[1:57:39] the blood in the Death Angel pass no the
[1:57:43] blood we're under we can't die
[1:57:47] we don't have to fear a Death Angel
[1:57:50] because this life is eternal
[1:57:56] hallelujah
[1:57:59] when you receive this life this covenant
[1:58:02] amen all that Jesus Christ is has come
[1:58:05] back upon the believer and we got
[1:58:10] stripped apart let this mind that was in
[1:58:12] Christ also be in see he wants us to
[1:58:18] understand that we are we are his people
[1:58:25] and when you receive this life if you
[1:58:31] seek today you got power over it why
[1:58:36] because he had power and all that God is
[1:58:44] has come upon the believer today all
[1:58:48] that His Word says has come back upon
[1:58:52] the believer and all we need to do is
[1:58:57] walk in it walk in what God has said
[1:59:01] about us Church don't walk out of here
[1:59:04] with the same stuff in your life don't
[1:59:07] walk out here fighting the same battles
[1:59:09] because what I love about moments like
[1:59:12] this you know how the prophet of God say
[1:59:15] yeah we lay hands on the believer but
[1:59:19] our promise is to speak the word you
[1:59:25] want to see God happy how many like to
[1:59:27] make God happy
[1:59:29] one muscle situation in the Bible that
[1:59:31] made God happy
[1:59:33] there was a Centurion who had a sick
[1:59:37] servant he sits for Jesus and Jesus was
[1:59:42] was was coming and didn't click he says
[1:59:44] a lot don't even come to my house he
[1:59:49] said I'm not even worried they don't
[1:59:51] even come to my house he said but you
[1:59:53] know what now God is on the way coming
[1:59:55] he told not to come and then he says hey
[1:59:56] I'm a man like you are like Authority
[1:59:59] like fashion he called for him to come
[2:00:03] and he realized he was just like him
[2:00:07] and that's what we do we've called for
[2:00:10] him to come not realizing that we are
[2:00:11] just like him so now he's saying I'm a
[2:00:17] man of like authority when I say come
[2:00:19] they come when I say go they go when I
[2:00:21] say jump they say how high because I'm a
[2:00:24] man of like authority he says a lot
[2:00:26] don't even that Jesus is walking he told
[2:00:29] another cop he says but don't even come
[2:00:33] to my house just speak the word only but
[2:00:37] you notice the Bible Jesus didn't stop
[2:00:39] coming as he began to talk Jesus kept
[2:00:44] coming closer to got to the place where
[2:00:47] he said Speak the word only Jesus came
[2:00:49] up to me since my god
[2:00:52] he said I've never seen such faith and
[2:00:55] you better believe he was smiling
[2:00:59] there's a place in the script away says
[2:01:01] he turned him around to the people he
[2:01:04] says I've never seen this kind of faith
[2:01:06] not in all these real and the Bible says
[2:01:10] from that very moment serves meal
[2:01:17] that's what we are identified with we
[2:01:23] identify with that how many believe it
[2:01:25] today we're not under a company of bulls
[2:01:29] and goats but we're under a covenant of
[2:01:31] the life of Jesus Christ that's what the
[2:01:35] holy ghost does the holy ghost brings
[2:01:37] the life of Jesus Christ on the believer
[2:01:42] so we ought to walk out of here in the
[2:01:45] power of the Resurrection knowing that
[2:01:48] all sickness was defeated at the cross
[2:01:51] all my problems were defeated at the
[2:01:54] cross everything I ever told about me
[2:01:56] was defeated at the cross let's pray
[2:02:09] Lord Jesus father we love you today
[2:02:13] thank you for your word Lord and Lord
[2:02:17] just to say that this service is all
[2:02:19] about you Lord the Lord let us climb
[2:02:22] into that place following this word can
[2:02:26] be a reality in our lives today
[2:02:29] Norwell you can deal with us as sons and
[2:02:32] it's daughters are not as servants but
[2:02:36] deal with us as the reason why you gave
[2:02:38] your life Lord you gave it that our
[2:02:41] nature would change you gave it Lord
[2:02:44] that we would be able to see the
[2:02:46] reflection of you in us and Lord God why
[2:02:51] you're going we're supposed to be here
[2:02:52] in Christ days so no God we pray father
[2:02:56] that you would continuously have
[2:02:58] preeminence in each and every life in
[2:03:00] this building today northern though
[2:03:03] there be trials don't be unconfessed
[2:03:05] sins we have a God that can deal with
[2:03:07] all nothing Lord and Lord in this sober
[2:03:12] moment Lord no we just ask that your
[2:03:14] presence would take full control for we
[2:03:18] know that the enemy is defeated because
[2:03:21] of you Lord and we are liberated because
[2:03:24] of you so we give ourselves unto you
[2:03:29] today nor that the work of redemption
[2:03:32] will continue to be made manifest in the
[2:03:35] lives of the believers to you be all
[2:03:39] glory all honor and Jesus Christ name we
