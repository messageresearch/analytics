TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we ought to be going forward as Moses said God said Moses tell him to go forward you're not to be idle for the kingdom of God because idleness produces a powerless life I don't listen the kingdom of God idleness in the family of God produces a powerless life you've got to be a person with a vision a runner has to have a vision he has to always keep it before him he has to constantly remind himself of the purpose and the reason but before he runs that race he's disciplined in himself how he sleeps Holly eats how he lives he's training constantly even the Apostle Paul says that and says those that strive for the mastery they do it for a carnal crown but we for a spiritual reward it says they do they do moderate they do bring their body into subjection that they have discipline in all areas of their life you've got to eat the right things and it takes discipline to eat the right things and it takes more discipline than that to not eat the wrong yeah it's a lot easier for me to look at that bowl of greens and broccoli and cabbage and spinach and force myself to eat it that's a lot easier than looking at those doughnuts and that sugar and that coconut cream pie and saying now but you've got to be disciplined because you've got a vision why does the why does a person how can they do that because they've seen an image in their mind of themself as a healthier more vibrant more in shape person and so they hold that image in their mind let me say this to you my brother I put the image in your mind of an overcoming Christian on fire with the baptism of the Holy Ghost busy about the kingdom of God and then gets upon yourself to become what you see [Applause]
