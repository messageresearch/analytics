TRANSCRIPT
========================================
paul wrote this that they would be without natural affection they'll be truth breakers and we looked at it last week that no no matter what you'd ever try to do to make peace with some people they just won't make it because they love to argue they love to fight they love to fuss and remember those people who persecute the elect of god cannot be elect themselves because elect cannot persecute elect it's totally impossible now you remember saul of tarsus was elect but he was not in elect position persecuting elect he was still lost he was unregenerate but you never find paul once he was quickened to the elect seat of god ever persecuting another elect member of the body of christ is that right so folks who want to make it hard on us folks who would look for every aspect to shut down our church folks that will look for every aspect by which they will be able to get us in some type of legal trouble or whatever more remember that is not the holy ghost that is an anointing from the devil himself well praise the lord now remember the lord jesus said that it would be that way that people would actually seek to kill you and think they were doing god a service i've told you over and over again i'll say it again tonight there are people in this message if they could get by with it would have already taken my life they hate me that bad if they thought they could get me assassinated and get it done was nobody tracing it back to them they would have already tried to do it now they wouldn't have been able to do it because i don't think my time on earth is done yet so that they might have shot me like with a 50 caliber machine gun and when i drunk a pepsi or whatever more i might have spurted out like a sieve in your kitchen but if it wasn't time for me to die they're not going to be able to kill me but that shows the wickedness and the evil hatred that is in people that we're dealing with at this time and remember most of those are not agnostics and infidels they just say oh they're a bunch of holy rollers just leave them alone but it's people that are anointed with a religious spirit and the church now remember whenever you go to getting around folks and they go to talking about somebody in the church or somebody else and they're going to say well now they're a good brother and they're a good sister oh my they're this and that and the other but ah now they're moving into the slandering gear now you see most of us would never accept just false and error and wrong and lies against a brother or sister that we love in the lord but slander will mix enough good that the person will try to convince you they're only telling you for your good to try to keep you from getting hurt of course most of us what we do we tend to repeat that slander ourselves i wonder how many lies we have told on people because somebody told us and we didn't dare check it out now remember whenever someone is telling you a story i've heard a lot of stories in my years of ministry and when it involves more than one person believe it or not i've always found out there's two sides but when we hear one side and make our judgment on one side you know what it proves you are a very foolish ignoramus i don't care if you're a preacher if you're a deacon i don't care who you are now if i look at you long enough i'll see your cheeks blushing some of you is blushing through your mask don't catch a mask on fire now you see this is one reason why we're not ready for the rapture because we accept lies we accept slander we accept gossip and the bible tells us how to accept rumors by witnesses but do many of us do it no why we think we're above the word well come on now happy valley don't get quiet on me but apparently we think we're above the word or we would take our closest friend to task if they told us something contrary to the pattern of the word wait a minute brother now according to the word aren't you supposed to have a witness or two witnesses to this and that's what the word says now look at one of the meanings that i found of this this word false accusers it is those who strive ever to ruin the character of others venting their malice by informing against and accusing others without any regard to the truth now listen what god said in the book of psalms again 101 verse 5 who so privily slanderest his neighbor him while i cut off the word cut off is put to an end to destroy exterminate terminate be annihilated isn't it amazing how we smell cigarettes on somebody or alcohol or marijuana we'll throw them in the pits of hell and have a slandering tongue and think we're so holy and so righteous god himself will annihilate you now listen friend this is not something to play with this is what god said so for those who slander brother branham for those who slander his message for those who slander message preachers for those who slander the people of god they won't meet me they won't meet necessarily you they will meet god at the day of judgment and you know what god's going to do to them unless they repent and make it right god will annihilate them
