[33:29] move on his heart when he's young before
[33:31] the evil days would come
[33:33] i pray for my sister lord that you would
[33:35] help her being the fifth gospel a
[33:38] powerful gospel the gospel of mother
[33:41] that she would be able to influence his
[33:43] life may hear them sing songs of the
[33:46] cross and the blood and mercy
[33:48] may he hear them reading the bible
[33:51] may an atmosphere be so created in their
[33:53] home that will be so godly that angels
[33:56] can visit their place
[33:58] lord jesus keep him from the evils and
[33:59] the diseases and the sicknesses of the
[34:01] day we commit his life to you dear
[34:04] father
[34:04] in jesus name
[34:06] amen
[34:08] [Applause]
[34:18] that's the well i do always mess up
[34:20] stuff no
[34:24] let's stand together if you would
[34:29] happy to be in the house of god together
[34:30] today presence of the lord
[34:33] amen counted such an honor to be
[34:36] gathered together once again
[34:39] presence of our great king
[34:41] how wonderful he is to us give us
[34:44] of his great abounding mercy and
[34:46] grace we so thank him
[34:48] let's turn to matthew
[34:50] chapter 4 if you would again today
[34:52] matthew chapter 4 verse
[34:54] 8 will read verses 8 through 11.
[34:58] we'll pick up on the third temptation of
[35:00] the lord jesus when satan has
[35:03] now offered him
[35:05] the kingdoms of the world
[35:08] again the devil taketh him into an
[35:09] exceeding high mountain
[35:11] and shows him all the kingdoms
[35:14] of the world
[35:16] and the glory of them
[35:18] and as i mentioned to you last night
[35:20] satan is actually allowed
[35:23] to cause jesus vision
[35:27] to break into a very fast-paced
[35:31] supernatural unfolding nowhere that is
[35:33] if though it's like this one slide after
[35:35] another after another at another of the
[35:37] glory of these kingdoms
[35:39] jesus is on this exceeding high mountain
[35:41] so elevation is also causing the effect
[35:44] to be enhanced and magnified
[35:47] he's been without food now for 40 days
[35:50] no doubt he's dizzy he's cold all these
[35:53] things are now affecting him
[35:56] and verse 9 says and saith unto him all
[35:58] these things will i give thee if thou
[36:00] will fall down and worship me
[36:04] then saith jesus unto him get the hints
[36:06] satan
[36:07] for it is written thou shalt worship the
[36:09] lord thy god and him only
[36:13] shalt thou serve then the devil
[36:15] leaveth him
[36:18] and behold angels came
[36:20] and ministered unto him
[36:23] what a change
[36:24] from the devil to angels
[36:28] amen
[36:30] our kids are starting school uh some of
[36:32] them i guess this week some maybe next
[36:34] but
[36:35] uh we certainly want to remember them
[36:36] today and not just today but as the
[36:39] weeks go by
[36:40] some of our kids are in public school
[36:42] some in home school so i'm not sure if
[36:44] we need to pray for those in home school
[36:45] if i pray for the kids or pray for the
[36:47] moms but
[36:49] maybe the dads whoever it is that does
[36:50] it but we certainly want to remember
[36:52] them
[36:53] i can't imagine what our children face
[36:55] what they go through the opposition the
[36:58] everything that they go through so we
[36:59] certainly want to keep them before the
[37:01] lord that god would just bless and be
[37:04] with them anybody else have a need
[37:05] request before the lord today with
[37:07] uplifting of your hand
[37:09] let's pray together heavenly father as
[37:11] we approach you today
[37:13] dear jesus we're so grateful for your
[37:15] mercy and your grace that's been
[37:17] extended to us
[37:18] lord i'm asking you now that you would
[37:21] just help us as we approach this part of
[37:23] the service that you would anoint me
[37:25] lord jesus
[37:26] but what good would that do father if
[37:28] you don't anoint the people to be able
[37:30] to receive
[37:31] so i pray to anoint me and anoint them
[37:33] as well
[37:34] father you see these prayer clothes that
[37:36] i have in my hands today lord sister
[37:38] lynette you see her in need
[37:40] sister sharon down in kentucky lord but
[37:42] praying for her that you just bring
[37:44] complete healing and deliverance for her
[37:46] as well
[37:47] lord as i mentioned our children uh some
[37:50] of them starting back to school this
[37:52] week some of them attending public
[37:53] schools some of home school different
[37:55] setups but we're asking you father for
[37:57] each of them that you would help them
[37:59] lord
[38:00] we know dear god we do not emphasize
[38:02] education but we also know lord in the
[38:04] civilization of the society that we live
[38:06] in it's such an emphasis that we we have
[38:09] to have it but we pray that you would
[38:11] help our children and the temptations
[38:13] and the things that they face
[38:15] we know lord god that they're living in
[38:17] a terrible time but i believe they can
[38:19] learn while they're young to deal with
[38:21] peer pressure lord jesus we know that
[38:23] you don't save us in this world and then
[38:25] put us in a bubble but you save us and
[38:27] then you give us the power to be able to
[38:29] live a life before them so i commit our
[38:32] children to you today father may you
[38:34] just help them dear god in the name of
[38:36] the lord jesus
[38:38] and the saints said amen
[38:40] praise be to god before you're seated uh
[38:43] every now and then i'll give you just a
[38:44] little bit of an update or
[38:47] something
[38:48] that we're doing overseas and some of
[38:49] the works that we've done i just wanted
[38:51] to share a couple things with you today
[38:54] in the last couple of weeks of some
[38:57] things that we've done we've been
[38:59] helping some other brothers
[39:01] here in the states who have had a burden
[39:03] on their heart
[39:04] to be able to bring and translate more
[39:07] of the messages into the spanish
[39:09] language
[39:11] we are
[39:13] been able to donate money toward that
[39:16] also to works in in africa all different
[39:19] parts of africa philippines
[39:22] uh guyana different places around the
[39:24] world so in the last couple of weeks
[39:26] we've been able to donate eighty
[39:28] thousand dollars toward those works
[39:33] [Applause]
[39:43] brother jim would you signify that by
[39:45] raising your hand being the treasure of
[39:47] the church
[39:48] thank you would you also signify brother
[39:50] jim that this is a drop
[39:53] in the bucket
[39:54] proverbially speaking
[39:57] over the years
[39:59] raise an hour people can sit
[40:01] hundreds
[40:03] and hundreds
[40:04] and hundreds
[40:06] of thousands of dollars
[40:10] and one day when you stand before the
[40:11] lord jesus
[40:13] and he goes to doing all this list of
[40:15] all these things and you're going to say
[40:17] when did i do that
[40:20] you mean
[40:21] i'm responsible
[40:23] we see the way i read the bible
[40:25] it's a father's place
[40:27] to lay up for his
[40:29] children
[40:32] i'm doing my best to make a reward
[40:35] a big one
[40:45] may i also say most of this giving is
[40:48] not to white people
[41:01] this eighty thousand dollars that we
[41:02] gave in the last two weeks was none of
[41:04] them to white churches
[41:06] there may be some white spanish people
[41:08] that'll benefit by it but most of it is
[41:10] people of color
[41:14] [Music]
[41:16] people of color
[41:17] [Applause]
[41:24] i've been all over the world i've been
[41:26] all over africa i have never preached in
[41:29] a white church in africa
[41:32] never purchasing a white one in india
[41:35] there's one pastor that we support
[41:36] full-time in the united states and done
[41:39] so for several years
[41:40] he is a black man
[41:44] why are you saying that oh i just like
[41:46] to scorch the devil every now and then
[41:49] just
[41:50] scorching
[41:56] and people have said that i'm a racist
[41:59] and i think it's time for me to confess
[42:01] and just really come out and be open and
[42:03] plain and honest i am
[42:05] i am i prefer one race above all the
[42:08] rest
[42:10] the god race
[42:26] and of course we have checks and bank
[42:28] drafts and all that sort of thing to
[42:30] prove all these statements
[42:35] jesus must have been
[42:38] so weary
[42:41] so weak
[42:44] so exhausted mentally
[42:46] physically
[42:47] psychologically
[42:50] being high on the mountain imagine the
[42:52] breezes were blowing
[42:54] on this side of the mountain of where he
[42:56] was at the only highest one there in in
[42:59] and around jerusalem
[43:02] his mind must have been weary his
[43:04] stomach gnawing with pain
[43:07] his nerves were
[43:09] tore to pieces
[43:12] he has not only the kingdoms of the
[43:15] world laying before him
[43:18] but the salvation of millions of souls
[43:21] are in his hands
[43:24] but as a man he
[43:26] chooses to
[43:28] humble himself
[43:30] and submit himself
[43:32] in such a way
[43:34] i hope you can if you don't get anything
[43:36] else out of the service today you can
[43:38] get this one thing
[43:40] the lord jesus meets satan
[43:43] in these challenges
[43:45] not as a preacher
[43:47] not even as the incarnate son of god was
[43:51] the fullness of the godhead bodily in
[43:54] him
[43:55] but he meets satan
[43:57] in these battles
[44:00] as the weakest christian
[44:03] that would live thereafter
[44:07] now if the lord jesus conquered satan
[44:10] as a captain
[44:12] of the host
[44:14] then everybody
[44:15] beneath him
[44:17] would have an excuse
[44:19] to fail
[44:20] if jesus meets satan
[44:23] as a prophet
[44:25] then everybody that is not a prophet
[44:27] beneath that call
[44:29] would have an excuse to say you cannot
[44:31] relate to me
[44:32] because you defeated him as a prophet
[44:35] if he met satan as a preacher
[44:38] then everybody that's not a preacher
[44:39] beneath that call
[44:41] would say it's not fair you met him as a
[44:44] preacher
[44:45] it's not fair how can you require this
[44:47] and me i was never a preacher
[44:50] but if jesus met the devil
[44:53] and defeated the devil
[44:55] as the weakest christian
[44:57] that would ever live on the face of the
[44:59] earth
[45:00] then everybody from the weakest up
[45:04] would be without excuse
[45:06] [Applause]
[45:08] praise be to god
[45:11] hallelujah
[45:12] [Applause]
[45:15] so he meets him
[45:17] in human weakness
[45:19] and psychological weakness
[45:22] in bodily weakness
[45:25] perils in his body perils
[45:28] in his mind
[45:30] the temperature was cold the elevation
[45:33] was high his body was weak
[45:36] he meets it in the natural realm and now
[45:39] he's meeting it in the supernatural
[45:42] realm
[45:43] to where that satan is allowed to take
[45:46] jesus
[45:47] in a moment of time
[45:49] and cause something supernaturally to
[45:52] happen to jesus in such a way as let me
[45:55] just background from last night a little
[45:57] that he takes the glory of america the
[45:59] glory of paris the glory of england the
[46:01] glory of zimbabwe the glory of all the
[46:03] kingdoms of the world and he stitches
[46:05] them all together as it was a
[46:07] fast-moving video in a moment of time
[46:09] and shows them the glory of the war of
[46:11] the world the kingdoms of the world he
[46:13] carries him up in the future of shows
[46:16] those kingdom which don't even yet exist
[46:19] he moves into the realm of dimensional
[46:22] travel by which the lord jesus is able
[46:26] to be carried up under spiritual
[46:28] influence and satan bombards him with
[46:31] all this going on in a moment of time
[46:35] now here's satan also by showing the
[46:38] lord jesus hitting him at this weakest
[46:40] time in his life all but i'm so glad
[46:44] that the lord was able to meet it this
[46:46] way
[46:47] but he doesn't just offer him that this
[46:49] now but satan now apparently feels this
[46:52] is the last time whether it's the
[46:54] culmination of the way he can see jesus
[46:56] attitude who knows exactly what it is
[46:58] but if you notice in this third
[47:00] temptation
[47:01] satan does not use any scripture
[47:06] he does not say it is written or it is
[47:08] written he does not use any scripture
[47:11] this time he pulls back all of that
[47:14] he comes with a brazen boldness which
[47:17] he's not used in the prior two examples
[47:20] the other time it is rich and they give
[47:22] his angels charged over there it is
[47:24] written but this time
[47:25] he doesn't even go that way
[47:28] so he comes to the real point or the
[47:31] jest of everything that he's been
[47:33] leading up to
[47:35] and that is worship me or fall down and
[47:38] worship before me now satan is going to
[47:42] offer it in a simple approach but with a
[47:45] very compound complex thing behind them
[47:50] now it simply comes and he says all
[47:52] these kingdoms of the world and all the
[47:54] glory of them i will give you after all
[47:57] you're supposed to be a king you're
[47:58] going to be the son of david you're
[48:00] going to be the messiah so i will give
[48:03] them to you just in a matter of moments
[48:04] you can bypass the cross bypass the
[48:07] suffering by pastor humiliation all the
[48:09] trouble of life you know yourself what
[48:11] the bible says about you how you're
[48:13] going to be cast out hated rejecting the
[48:15] spies of him so i will offer you
[48:18] basically what you want to accomplish
[48:20] without all of this suffering it is
[48:22] absolutely not essential you do not have
[48:26] to go this way to be a king if you want
[48:29] to be the king of the earth i will make
[48:32] a bargain with you
[48:36] are you interested jesus
[48:39] and as a man jesus contemplates
[48:43] i wouldn't have to suffer i wouldn't
[48:45] have to be beaten i wouldn't have to be
[48:46] whipped i will not have to be ridiculed
[48:49] all the rest of my life people will love
[48:51] me people will accept me people
[48:53] everybody will stop making fun of me my
[48:55] birth nobody else will make fun of me
[48:57] from this point on i'll be the king
[49:04] so satan promises him
[49:06] i'll give you this kingdom
[49:09] but
[49:10] no
[49:11] cross
[49:13] no humiliation
[49:15] and remember now satan is not offering
[49:17] him nothing in eternity
[49:19] there's nothing in the millennium
[49:20] mentioned
[49:22] there's nothing after the after time is
[49:24] over that is mentioned you know why
[49:27] satan has nothing to offer on that side
[49:30] now if you will check every promise that
[49:32] the devil offers you
[49:34] and see where they lead to
[49:37] he can offer you nothing beyond time
[49:41] he can offer you nothing in heaven he
[49:44] can offer you nothing in the streets of
[49:46] gold he can offer you nothing in the
[49:49] millennium because he has nothing to
[49:51] offer
[49:53] [Applause]
[49:54] praise be to god
[49:57] oh hallelujah hallelujah satan don't
[50:00] even have a back alley if there is one
[50:03] in heaven he don't even offer have one
[50:06] thing to offer you and i in the eighth
[50:09] day cause he won't be there
[50:13] he has nothing to offer you in the
[50:15] millennium because he won't be there he
[50:19] will be bound down there in that pit by
[50:22] a chain of circumstance
[50:25] [Applause]
[50:30] luke says it this way in luke chapter 4
[50:33] verse 6 and the devil said unto him
[50:36] all this power
[50:38] will i give thee and the glory of them
[50:41] for that is delivered unto me to
[50:43] whomsoever
[50:45] i will give it boy don't you know he
[50:47] loves to brag about what he's got
[50:50] he loves to do the same thing to you and
[50:52] i today now this temptation would
[50:55] eliminate the pain of the cross
[50:58] it would eliminate all that jesus knows
[51:01] that he's going to deal with but
[51:02] remember one thing that satan is trying
[51:04] to do he's trying to get jesus to live
[51:08] in the realm that adam lived in that eve
[51:11] lived in that moses lived in that ache
[51:13] and lived in and that is the realm of
[51:16] selfishness
[51:18] he wants to get jesus to move beyond
[51:21] what the cross will require and that is
[51:25] self-denial
[51:29] because this is one thing satan
[51:31] cannot do
[51:33] he cannot deny himself
[51:36] it's just not in him you understand that
[51:38] it is not in satan to operate this way
[51:41] now the essence of sin
[51:44] is selfishness now we know that sin is
[51:47] unbelief but the essence of sin what
[51:50] causes you and i every time that we do
[51:54] wrong whether it is lying or saying
[51:56] something wrong or doing something wrong
[51:58] or whatever it is the essence of what
[52:01] causes us to do that is because we are
[52:04] selfish concerning that matter that we
[52:07] fell into
[52:08] so satan knew that from the very
[52:10] beginning why was it that eve listened
[52:13] to the lie of the devil selfishness she
[52:15] wanted to be able to partake of the
[52:18] forbidden fruit and to be wise like god
[52:21] what caused abraham as we looked at it
[52:24] what caused abraham to to frisk his wife
[52:27] before pharaoh and abimelech selfishness
[52:31] what caused aiken to take the wedge of
[52:34] gold and the babylonian garment and
[52:36] cause the entire church of god to fail
[52:39] in a battle that god led them into what
[52:41] caused that selfishness
[52:44] so satan is approaching the lord jesus
[52:48] in the realm of selfishness
[52:54] you don't have to deny yourself
[52:58] no cross
[52:59] no suffering no humiliation
[53:02] all crown and glory and honor and praise
[53:06] and adoration
[53:08] no death to self
[53:10] which is the modern gospel of the day
[53:14] now if you look at it it's it's amazing
[53:17] when satan is able to move even on the
[53:19] hearts of genuine people of god that
[53:22] still fights selfishness oh you sound a
[53:24] christian i don't fight it there's not a
[53:26] person sitting in this building that
[53:28] don't fight selfishness maybe that baby
[53:31] i dedicated a while ago but don't worry
[53:33] he'll pick it up soon enough
[53:35] it's in us it's in the fall it's part of
[53:38] what we inherited
[53:40] selfishness now come on church get with
[53:43] me
[53:44] watch this and seven compound names of
[53:46] jehovah brother man said it be a selfish
[53:49] thing if a man's heart isn't out to save
[53:51] his brother there's something wrong with
[53:54] his heart no matter what the condition
[53:57] if his brother hates him
[54:01] if his brother's against him if his
[54:04] brothers tried everything he can to tear
[54:07] him down yet that man's heart pulls for
[54:11] his brother
[54:15] we can do that right
[54:17] no matter what people do to you no
[54:19] matter what they say no matter how much
[54:20] they run you down now i'm pointing to
[54:23] you to the essence of sin the reason
[54:25] that people cannot do this is because of
[54:29] selfishness but you see the lord jesus
[54:32] came to crucify selfishness and make a
[54:35] way by a new birth that we could too why
[54:38] did david commit adultery selfishness
[54:41] why did he have uriah kill selfishness
[54:46] why did moses do what he did selfishness
[54:49] why do you and i do what we do many
[54:51] times selfishness
[54:55] why do we get angry if somebody gets our
[54:57] parking spot out yonder selfishness
[55:00] what bothers us if somebody gets our
[55:03] favorite spot on the pew and we can't
[55:05] get nothing out of the whole service
[55:07] selfishness
[55:14] now watch you mean a brother hates you
[55:17] and is against you and tried everything
[55:19] he can everything he can to tear you
[55:23] down
[55:24] and yet you still love him and pray for
[55:26] him
[55:28] there's something in you that calls out
[55:30] oh my brother you're wrong but i want
[55:34] you to be saved let me say this friend

[55:43] altar before the service is over i know
[55:46] of absolutely no one no one that i want
[55:50] to see perish i don't know of one mortal
[55:53] that i want to see go to hell if i do
[55:55] i'll stop preaching right now and ask
[55:57] you all to pray for me
[56:03] notice this again in enticing spirits
[56:05] notice the sight title of the sermon
[56:07] enticing spirits little things those old
[56:10] tempers and everything like that that
[56:11] keeps you down and say god i don't want
[56:14] that thing no more i'm sick and tired of
[56:16] it i'm ready today to discard it i'm
[56:19] coming now lord i want to get away from
[56:21] all my selfishness if my brother doesn't
[56:25] treat me right i'm going to get on
[56:27] facebook and i'm going to call him a
[56:29] devil i'll tell
[56:30] you
[56:32] oh that's the happy valley version
[56:35] [Music]
[56:38] if my brother doesn't treat me right
[56:41] i'll pray for him
[56:46] now the key is not praying for him but
[56:47] it's how you pray for him
[56:50] god let his car blow up god let his wife
[56:52] divorce him god let him lose his job
[56:54] may's nose fall off from the garbage
[56:56] disposal maybe break every one of his
[56:58] fingers off except for one just to
[57:00] aggravate him god i pray the judgment of
[57:02] god will come down on him you ain't got
[57:04] the holy ghost
[57:08] that's not the spirit of christ it's the
[57:10] devil
[57:12] well praise the lord
[57:15] now watch this if my brother doesn't
[57:17] treat me right i'll pray for him anyhow
[57:19] if my daddy doesn't treat me right i'll
[57:22] love him anyhow if my wife doesn't treat
[57:25] me right i'll divorce her and i'll get
[57:27] me a younger one cause she's old and
[57:29] ugly anyhow
[57:34] if my wife doesn't treat me right or my
[57:37] husband i'll go about humble before god
[57:42] lord have mercy what a peculiar way to
[57:44] approach this your wife don't treat you
[57:46] right or your husband don't treat you
[57:48] right but the answer is that you go
[57:50] around humble before god i thought that
[57:52] was the problem
[57:55] [Music]
[57:57] you see why we needed a prophet with a
[57:58] message don't you
[58:00] let's just face it we don't know how to
[58:01] get out of this world
[58:03] we don't know how to love people we
[58:04] don't know how to do we're always
[58:05] pointing at ourselves they keep me wrong
[58:07] they keep me wrong they treat me wrong
[58:08] and what do we do we exalt self
[58:10] instead of humbling ourselves so god can
[58:13] bring an answer
[58:15] well praise be to god notice again now
[58:18] enticing spirits now let us list out
[58:20] every way if you've got a temper you've
[58:22] got something about you that you talk
[58:24] when you ought not to talk oh god layeth
[58:28] there now lay it there watch the fire
[58:30] the altar come down and take it away
[58:33] man we need a bonfire broke loose in the
[58:35] message when it comes this don't we
[58:37] watch the love of god look it up watch
[58:39] all that old selfishness the way you've
[58:42] been
[58:46] your brothers have a bleep machine where
[58:48] you could just bleep me on certain parts
[58:54] they don't have one back there so i
[58:55] guess i'll just go ahead and read it
[58:57] what's all that old selfish is the way
[58:59] you've been talking to your wife
[59:01] the way you've been talking to your
[59:02] husband selfishness
[59:11] the way you've been talking to your
[59:13] neighbor the way you've talked to people
[59:15] in church
[59:16] lay it on the altar this morning
[59:19] and the fire of god will come down and
[59:22] take it right away and divine love
[59:25] will burn in its place
[59:30] somebody tell me to go on
[59:33] thank you now your voice is on tape that
[59:36] you said it
[59:37] but you told me to but you still said it
[59:39] you didn't have to
[59:41] god notice he said jesus speaking of the
[59:43] lord jesus has to have access to every
[59:45] room in the house talking about our
[59:46] heart every compartment all the little
[59:48] secret things of life he's got to have
[59:50] access to every bit of it then he
[59:52] becomes lord what does he want to come
[59:55] in your heart for is to be your lord
[59:57] he's knocking at the door to be your
[59:59] savior and if you hold selfishness and
[1:00:02] pride and malice and all these things in
[1:00:05] your heart he can't be lord
[1:00:08] though you accept him in he can't be
[1:00:11] lord
[1:00:14] jesus can't be lord
[1:00:17] of the selfish art
[1:00:26] listen to this children you talk about
[1:00:27] serious things
[1:00:29] you see what pride and selfishness does
[1:00:33] it shuts you out
[1:00:37] from the kingdom of god
[1:00:42] not just been married to three times
[1:00:45] not blasphemed the holy ghost not
[1:00:47] calling god's prophet a liar
[1:00:49] selfishness and pride
[1:00:51] will shut you out of the kingdom of god
[1:00:53] the same way bliss family will
[1:00:57] this is serious
[1:00:58] this is not something to play with
[1:01:04] oh my
[1:01:06] i wonder sometimes he said as we think
[1:01:08] what will happen to this generation and
[1:01:11] i wonder what he would say about it now
[1:01:13] if he'd preach to
[1:01:14] this generation now
[1:01:16] can i go on
[1:01:17] watch this an image of christ now
[1:01:19] remember it's only the sick
[1:01:22] that demands attention
[1:01:24] service just the sick they demand
[1:01:27] attention when you see a preacher
[1:01:30] and may i not limit it to a preacher but
[1:01:32] may i limit to every church member that
[1:01:35] wants
[1:01:36] attention i'm somebody just remember
[1:01:40] there's a spiritual
[1:01:42] sick
[1:01:43] person
[1:01:51] they're needing attention
[1:01:54] now they're needing attention and no
[1:01:56] doubt they don't have a diagnosis of
[1:01:57] what kind of attention they need they
[1:01:59] want this attention or that attention
[1:02:01] public acknowledgement or attention from
[1:02:03] the pastor attention from this that
[1:02:04] another but brother madam is going to
[1:02:05] tell us actually the kind of attention
[1:02:07] they need they need the attention of the
[1:02:10] spirit of god to give them something
[1:02:11] that will take that attitude out of them
[1:02:14] oh my lord now what they actually want
[1:02:17] is something that will appease that but
[1:02:19] that's not the answer the prophet said
[1:02:21] they need what they really need is
[1:02:23] something that will take that attitude
[1:02:26] out not just appease them
[1:02:32] mama
[1:02:36] notice let me read this again they need
[1:02:38] attention but they need the attention of
[1:02:40] the spirit of god to give them something
[1:02:41] that will take that attitude out of them
[1:02:44] notice how they said they're so strange
[1:02:46] and heals them
[1:02:49] from their selfishness
[1:02:52] wow
[1:02:54] heal them from selfish how do you get
[1:02:57] healed from selfishness
[1:02:59] now all of us have been injured and hurt
[1:03:01] i've got scars all over my hands all
[1:03:03] over my body like you have from
[1:03:05] scratches and crepes and whatever more
[1:03:07] that we've been through in life and your
[1:03:08] body has the built-in mechanism to be
[1:03:11] able to to heal itself and close up a
[1:03:13] wound at all and we've had our souls
[1:03:15] healed by the power of redemption so now
[1:03:17] we're talking about of being healed from
[1:03:20] selfishness not just delivered but
[1:03:23] actually healed so the selfish sister is
[1:03:26] an approach or an attitude of
[1:03:28] selfishness which is actually a sickness
[1:03:34] so we're not just casting a devil out of
[1:03:36] somebody and the devil is going to leave
[1:03:38] them and then they'll be healed but it
[1:03:40] is a sickness
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:49] give them something that will take that
[1:03:51] attitude out of them and heal them from
[1:03:53] their selfishness and big ideas
[1:03:55] and big million little you
[1:03:58] the holy ghost makes us all the same
[1:04:03] there ain't no big preachers in this
[1:04:05] message and little preachers in this
[1:04:06] message and big singers and little
[1:04:09] singers were all just children of god
[1:04:12] that's why we are all just children of
[1:04:14] god but you realize that many folks i
[1:04:17] believe with all of my heart around our
[1:04:18] message need a healing not so much in a
[1:04:21] prayer life they don't necessarily need
[1:04:22] their soul heal but they need a healing
[1:04:25] of selfishness and this is what satan is
[1:04:28] offering to jesus
[1:04:30] go in this approach
[1:04:31] think of yourself first
[1:04:35] you
[1:04:35] look jesus think about you
[1:04:38] what about you
[1:04:42] you're thinking about others you're
[1:04:44] thinking about the will of god you're
[1:04:45] thinking about the program of god what
[1:04:47] about you
[1:04:55] and naturally that's the way we're made
[1:05:01] who did you feed for you come to church
[1:05:03] today
[1:05:04] you or me
[1:05:08] jefe juror your wife brother andy
[1:05:11] she figured your wife brother jim who'd
[1:05:13] you see
[1:05:14] why it's built in us
[1:05:16] it's built in us
[1:05:17] this is why that our makeup feeds on
[1:05:20] selfishness
[1:05:23] and jesus was so much a man he had to
[1:05:26] experience selfishness
[1:05:34] so for a few moments
[1:05:37] jesus thought about
[1:05:39] jesus
[1:05:45] i wonder if we really realize
[1:05:47] how human
[1:05:49] he was
[1:05:54] was it a moment was it five minutes was
[1:05:56] the ten who knows how long it was
[1:05:58] but first say it this way for a few
[1:06:00] moments of time jesus didn't think about
[1:06:02] gabriel jesus did not think about warren
[1:06:04] what jesus didn't think about donnie
[1:06:06] about gene about wes jesus didn't think
[1:06:08] about none of us
[1:06:09] jesus thought about
[1:06:11] jesus
[1:06:19] listen brother bam says
[1:06:21] the holy spirit can't deal with you
[1:06:25] when you got prejudice
[1:06:28] and selfishness
[1:06:32] now whether it's prejudice by color
[1:06:35] whether it's prejudice by doctrine
[1:06:38] prejudice by the size of your church
[1:06:40] or prejudice by feeling like you you're
[1:06:42] more illuminated than any other church
[1:06:44] in the message prejudice comes in all
[1:06:45] shapes and forms and sizes
[1:06:50] don't you see why satan wants to get us
[1:06:52] on this exclusive something
[1:06:54] that we've got something special about
[1:06:56] every other message church
[1:07:00] as long as i'm the pastor of this church
[1:07:02] i'm going to slay that devil
[1:07:05] i'm going to keep it before you we are
[1:07:07] only one of many
[1:07:09] this ministry here is only one of many
[1:07:11] and may i say a very small one compared
[1:07:14] to many they're around the world our
[1:07:16] church is not some super something other
[1:07:18] than everybody else is supposed to look
[1:07:19] to that is a lie from the pits of hell
[1:07:23] donny reagan's ministry terry horn daryl
[1:07:26] ward and the rest of these men we are
[1:07:28] not the example for the people of the
[1:07:30] message we're only one little pebble
[1:07:32] among many great stones
[1:07:36] it is selfishness it is prejudice
[1:07:39] [Applause]
[1:07:44] watch this in the marriage of the lamb
[1:07:45] the prophet said so i think that's the
[1:07:46] way preaching the gospel if it don't
[1:07:48] stir you up a little bit
[1:07:50] and feel your spiritual gastronomics and
[1:07:52] make you a little bit sick to examine
[1:07:54] yourself with the bible says that old
[1:07:56] temper and selfishness and ungodliness
[1:07:59] and love of the world and television and
[1:08:01] things that that night and leaving
[1:08:03] church set empty and pew said empty when
[1:08:05] you ought to be out there like jesus you
[1:08:07] got his spirit in you trying to get
[1:08:09] everybody in the country to come to your
[1:08:10] church and receive christ
[1:08:13] do you know that brother branham told us
[1:08:15] in 1956 55 56 that one thing that god
[1:08:19] ahab in trouble was because his wife
[1:08:22] didn't want him to attend church on
[1:08:24] wednesday night
[1:08:30] notice again he says in communion we
[1:08:31] want to keep ourselves clean
[1:08:36] from
[1:08:36] selfishness
[1:08:38] some of you would die before you'd smoke
[1:08:40] a cigarette
[1:08:42] you can't even stand to get around where
[1:08:44] people smokes them because you feel
[1:08:46] dirty and filthy
[1:08:48] you'd never put a press a a whiskey
[1:08:51] bottle to your lips or a can of beer
[1:08:54] but there's more to being cleaned from
[1:08:57] than smoking and
[1:08:59] that sort of thing
[1:09:01] we need to clean ourselves from
[1:09:03] selfishness
[1:09:08] notice he said we want to keep ourselves
[1:09:10] clean
[1:09:12] from selfishness keep our sin our lives
[1:09:15] clean from the things of the world that
[1:09:17] will not be spotted with that we want to
[1:09:20] be ready for the rapture
[1:09:24] so this temptation of the lord jesus
[1:09:27] is focusing on the essence of sin which
[1:09:31] is
[1:09:32] selfishness
[1:09:34] and for a few moments now jesus
[1:09:37] begins to ponder yes sir
[1:09:40] let me
[1:09:41] project it to you this way
[1:09:44] maybe he ran his hand over his side
[1:09:49] down his back
[1:09:51] thinking
[1:09:53] according to god's way
[1:09:56] my back will be tore to pieces
[1:10:02] let's just say that he run his hand
[1:10:05] upon the side of his face where his
[1:10:07] beard was
[1:10:10] said according to god's way
[1:10:13] they'll reach up and grab the hole to my
[1:10:15] beard
[1:10:17] and pull handfuls of it out
[1:10:22] maybe he ran his hand across the rest of
[1:10:24] his face and said
[1:10:26] according to god's way
[1:10:28] they'll spit
[1:10:30] on my face
[1:10:35] is this what i want
[1:10:39] but from this offer that satan is giving
[1:10:41] offering me i can go from here to here
[1:10:45] i eliminate the beard plucking
[1:10:47] i eliminate all the spit
[1:10:50] i eliminate all the ridicule all the
[1:10:52] ones making fun of me because he says
[1:10:53] he'll give me the kingdom of the world
[1:10:55] and i'll get it right now i mean i have
[1:10:56] to wait two thousand years i don't have
[1:10:57] to wait for a throne i go from here to
[1:10:59] here in a matter of minutes
[1:11:07] and for a few moments jesus thought
[1:11:08] about
[1:11:09] jesus
[1:11:12] do i really want to do this
[1:11:15] can i take this
[1:11:19] i'm so glad when jesus thought about
[1:11:21] jesus
[1:11:24] that his thoughts about jesus was not
[1:11:25] the lingering thoughts
[1:11:28] that his thoughts
[1:11:30] were about me brother talking about you
[1:11:35] so the next time you go to thinking
[1:11:36] about you so and so did this to me and
[1:11:38] i'm going to do this and i'm going to do
[1:11:39] that maybe you ought to go back to jesus
[1:11:41] on the mountain and think about wait a
[1:11:43] minute what if jesus would have thought
[1:11:44] about himself what if jesus would have
[1:11:46] kept himself there and well he's the one
[1:11:48] he's going to realize it's not fair this
[1:11:50] ain't fair not even fair it ain't right
[1:11:51] you know how come i have to go through
[1:11:52] this and how come i have to go through
[1:11:54] that you know what you're doing you're
[1:11:55] thinking about yourself
[1:11:56] instead of thinking god is this your
[1:11:58] will god is this what you want i don't
[1:12:00] want this i don't want to go that that's
[1:12:02] what i'm talking about selfishness
[1:12:13] of course satan by now already is
[1:12:15] realizing
[1:12:17] this could be him
[1:12:20] this could be
[1:12:22] him
[1:12:28] watch in matthew chapter 4 verse 9
[1:12:31] and he says unto him all these things
[1:12:32] will i give thee
[1:12:34] if thou will fall down and worship me
[1:12:37] now here's the price
[1:12:39] in the temptation
[1:12:42] every time satan offers your eyes
[1:12:43] something there's always a price
[1:12:46] for what he's offering us
[1:12:48] he's never giving you anything free of
[1:12:51] charge i don't care how much he wants to
[1:12:53] tell you it's free
[1:12:54] there's always a cost and it ain't going
[1:12:57] to cost him it's going to cost you and
[1:13:00] maybe your wife your children your
[1:13:02] church whatever more whenever you yield
[1:13:04] to a temptation there is a price now
[1:13:07] here jesus finally hears the price
[1:13:12] of going from here to here
[1:13:15] versus coming around here and waiting
[1:13:17] two thousand years and all this stuff
[1:13:19] that you get over here to become king
[1:13:23] so here's the price
[1:13:25] all you have to do
[1:13:28] is fall down
[1:13:30] before me
[1:13:34] the disciples on here
[1:13:36] nobody will ever even know it
[1:13:41] the church is not here
[1:13:42] the priest ain't here the preacher ain't
[1:13:44] here ain't nobody here but me and you
[1:13:48] and do you think that blabber mouth the
[1:13:50] devil is going to keep that a secret
[1:13:53] you've heard me say it before he's the
[1:13:55] type of a guy that'll talk you into
[1:13:56] robin the man call the cops on you while
[1:13:58] you're doing it
[1:14:00] jesus wouldn't have got up off of his
[1:14:02] knee before every devil out of hell
[1:14:04] would have known it caiaphas would have
[1:14:06] known it it would have been known oh yes
[1:14:08] sir it would have been known around the
[1:14:10] world from the cohorts of the abyss they
[1:14:13] would have been able to know all of the
[1:14:15] world and the kingdoms of the world
[1:14:16] would have submitted to the lord jesus
[1:14:18] and he would have been exalted to the
[1:14:20] throne and the king of the earth without
[1:14:23] a bride
[1:14:24] without any overcomers and generation
[1:14:27] after generation they would have died
[1:14:29] and the book of life would have remained
[1:14:31] in the hands of almighty god
[1:14:38] so here
[1:14:40] is the price
[1:14:44] so the price that satan
[1:14:46] makes from this conjecture
[1:14:49] is that you
[1:14:50] are rewarded
[1:14:52] by doing wrong
[1:14:58] you are rewarded
[1:15:00] by doing wrong so you do wrong and
[1:15:03] you're rewarded
[1:15:05] yes
[1:15:06] ma
[1:15:07] you're rewarded that this and this is
[1:15:09] part of it this is the way he projects
[1:15:11] it
[1:15:14] any price that you have to
[1:15:16] trade off of god's word
[1:15:19] you're going to be the
[1:15:22] loser now watch he says all these things
[1:15:25] while i give thee thou will fall down
[1:15:28] and worship me now notice the way this
[1:15:30] is written here in the eastern method of
[1:15:33] acknowledging the superiority
[1:15:36] of a person
[1:15:39] so by jesus bowing down before him not
[1:15:42] so much that satan was saying all right
[1:15:44] now worship me as god you wash him oh
[1:15:47] lucifer oh
[1:15:49] satan i worship hill oh no
[1:15:53] all he's asking is for jesus to bow down
[1:15:57] and he can worship god that's okay
[1:16:00] but acknowledge that satan is superior
[1:16:03] do you understand what this is
[1:16:05] it is michael
[1:16:07] and lucifer
[1:16:08] once again
[1:16:12] praise be to god do you understand
[1:16:15] what's going on right now in laodicea it
[1:16:18] is michael and lucifer once again do you
[1:16:21] understand the warfare against the bride
[1:16:24] who's bringing the warfare against the
[1:16:26] bride the church what is it michael and
[1:16:30] lucifer once again what will it be when
[1:16:32] he ascends upon the mountain fighting
[1:16:34] for the children of israel it will be
[1:16:37] michael and lucifer once again
[1:16:48] all you have to do
[1:16:50] i'm not asking you to pray to me
[1:16:52] i'm not asking you just give me
[1:16:55] superiority
[1:16:58] you saved that devil how would he ever
[1:17:00] do that the same way he does you
[1:17:03] when he tries to convince you
[1:17:06] his weapons are greater than yours
[1:17:09] do you understand
[1:17:11] when you
[1:17:12] believe and suggest
[1:17:15] that satan's power his kingdom his
[1:17:18] darkness is greater than what god has
[1:17:21] given you in this age you are giving him
[1:17:24] superiority
[1:17:26] over the word of god
[1:17:30] oh you're not bound to answer satan
[1:17:31] you're a god satan you're a god but
[1:17:33] whenever you sell the devil's power says
[1:17:35] it's harder than the holy ghost what
[1:17:37] the devil's kingdom is greater than the
[1:17:39] kingdom of god you're worshiping
[1:17:42] oh you're worshiping god but you're
[1:17:44] falling down before him and giving him
[1:17:46] superiority
[1:17:53] you are telling him
[1:17:54] you're greater than me
[1:17:57] i can't do this
[1:17:59] i can't overcome this i just you're
[1:18:01] greater than me you are falling before
[1:18:03] him
[1:18:06] and giving him superiority
[1:18:09] in your life
[1:18:10] when my bible tells me greater is he
[1:18:13] that is in you
[1:18:15] than he that is in the world
[1:18:22] satan knows most of you will never fall
[1:18:24] before him you'll never make a hexagon
[1:18:26] or a pentagram on the ground and never
[1:18:28] offer a goat you'll never offer a
[1:18:30] sacrifice he didn't want to try you that
[1:18:32] way but he'll try to wear you out with
[1:18:34] sickness and distress and worry and
[1:18:36] family problems and financial problems
[1:18:38] and church problems and all kinds of
[1:18:40] problems and then get you to say oh i
[1:18:42] can't take it no more i can't do it no
[1:18:44] more i just don't know what to do
[1:18:45] anymore i'm at my wits and i don't think
[1:18:47] i'll go back i can't live this don't you
[1:18:49] know what you're doing you're bowing
[1:18:51] before satan again
[1:18:53] you're not worshiping him as god but
[1:18:55] you're saying he's superior over you
[1:18:57] you're saying he's superior over this
[1:19:00] bible he's superior over this message
[1:19:14] let me just level the ground right now
[1:19:16] before i go any further
[1:19:18] it is absolutely totally impossible
[1:19:22] for satan to make you do one thing
[1:19:33] you are giving him power that he does
[1:19:36] not have
[1:19:41] and you are scared to death of a
[1:19:42] defeated enemy
[1:19:48] i feel like having church
[1:19:53] [Applause]
[1:19:59] now watch the lord jesus
[1:20:03] in verse 10 then saith jesus
[1:20:06] unto him amen
[1:20:09] get thee hands
[1:20:11] satan
[1:20:16] well you need sister
[1:20:19] i got jesus in my heart but i want him
[1:20:24] in the name of jesus
[1:20:26] father you see the need of our sister
[1:20:28] now she's got you in her heart she says
[1:20:30] lord but she wants you closer i pray
[1:20:33] father
[1:20:44] hallelujah
[1:20:51] now what satan offers jesus this now
[1:20:54] watching jesus replied then saith jesus
[1:20:57] unto him get their heads
[1:21:00] uh-oh
[1:21:02] satan
[1:21:04] first time jesus has referred to him in
[1:21:07] a personal way
[1:21:12] there is degrees of offense and defense
[1:21:16] there is degrees notice the first two
[1:21:18] times when jesus responds to the word he
[1:21:20] responds to the word that this
[1:21:23] he's crossed the line
[1:21:27] he does not call him lucifer he does not
[1:21:29] call him devil he does not call him
[1:21:31] satan in the first two attacks but this
[1:21:33] attack demands personal detention
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:39] hallelujah
[1:21:41] oh
[1:21:42] i think sometimes our righteous
[1:21:44] indignation needs to get built up i
[1:21:46] ain't talking about at the pastor some
[1:21:48] of you do good get mad at the pastor
[1:21:50] some of you do real good getting mad at
[1:21:52] the deacons are mad at your wife you
[1:21:53] ought to get mad at the devil the
[1:21:56] devil's stealing your joy the devil's
[1:21:58] stealing your peace the devil's stealing
[1:22:00] your children the devil's stealing all
[1:22:02] this around you and you sit around
[1:22:05] passive and let him get by with it
[1:22:08] don't get mad at the preacher don't get
[1:22:10] mad at your wife get mad at the devil
[1:22:12] he's the one that's doing it to you
[1:22:22] [Applause]
[1:22:24] then saith jesus
[1:22:27] unto him
[1:22:29] kitty hence
[1:22:31] satan
[1:22:35] a great temptation must be withstood
[1:22:38] with great resolution
[1:22:43] i'm sick of your mouth
[1:22:46] you hear me
[1:22:47] i'm sick of you
[1:22:48] satan
[1:22:50] i know who you are i know who you are
[1:22:53] sometimes you need to acknowledge some
[1:22:55] thoughts going through your mind them
[1:22:57] thought you ain't a child of god you
[1:22:59] ain't this other sometimes you need to
[1:23:01] call his name and say satan
[1:23:03] i recognize who you are and you are a
[1:23:06] liar and the father of the lie
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:20] what's the power
[1:23:22] over the temptation
[1:23:25] how does it come
[1:23:26] by submission
[1:23:30] jesus didn't drag out his computer
[1:23:32] and his laptop and put together 47 pages
[1:23:35] of quotes
[1:23:40] don't you notice this temptation here
[1:23:45] notice where he comes from
[1:23:47] he will stand satan
[1:23:50] and he comes against him
[1:23:52] with power
[1:23:56] he demonstrates the power of god
[1:24:00] in the weakest christian's life
[1:24:02] to defeat satan upon what gifts emotion
[1:24:05] talking in tongues the word of god
[1:24:11] friends there is power
[1:24:14] in separation
[1:24:18] there is power in separation
[1:24:21] you never get overcome your trials and
[1:24:24] your tests and the things and the sins
[1:24:26] as long as you're fooling with them and
[1:24:28] playing with them
[1:24:34] separation from evil gives you power
[1:24:37] over evil
[1:24:40] mixing evil with righteousness weakens
[1:24:43] righteousness
[1:24:47] and we are living in an age of constant
[1:24:50] mixture mix this mix that mix this mix
[1:24:53] that i say that is alive the devil
[1:24:56] if we want power in this day we've got
[1:24:59] to separate ourselves
[1:25:03] i ain't talking about just from the
[1:25:04] world i'm talking from yourself
[1:25:09] of course people don't like the idea of
[1:25:11] separation
[1:25:12] they want mixers
[1:25:14] but everybody in one big mixing
[1:25:17] mix it all up mixing up for hell firing
[1:25:19] tribulations where they're heading
[1:25:25] hallelujah
[1:25:27] guilty head satan
[1:25:29] foreign
[1:25:32] thou shalt worship
[1:25:36] the lord thy god
[1:25:40] he overcomes all three of these
[1:25:41] temptations from one old testament book
[1:25:43] the book of deuteronomy
[1:25:45] like david's standing there flinging his
[1:25:47] sling when he's got five smooth stones
[1:25:49] down on his pouch but david reaches down
[1:25:52] there and grabs a hole to one the book
[1:25:53] of deuteronomy and he defeats the devil
[1:25:55] out of that one book if one book was
[1:25:58] simple three passages of scripture would
[1:26:00] overcome this temptation right here
[1:26:01] which is nothing like any of us have
[1:26:03] ever went through anyhow if it would do
[1:26:05] that what in the name of almighty god
[1:26:07] with an entire bible a thousand tapes
[1:26:10] sermons preached all around the world
[1:26:12] what would that do to empower you and i
[1:26:15] as believers to overcome the devil
[1:26:24] what am i speaking to you about children
[1:26:26] resisting temptation
[1:26:34] what does he do
[1:26:36] he takes up his shield
[1:26:40] takes up his shield
[1:26:41] takes his sword
[1:26:48] and he said it is written
[1:26:51] thou shalt worship
[1:26:53] the lord thy god
[1:26:55] and he'll moan me
[1:26:57] shalt thou serve
[1:26:58] how did he know which one of these
[1:27:00] scriptures in the drama would work
[1:27:04] why not take genesis 1 1.
[1:27:07] in the beginning god created the heavens
[1:27:08] and the earth and the earth was without
[1:27:10] form and void and darkness covered the
[1:27:11] face of the deep and the spirit of god
[1:27:13] moved upon the face of the deep and god
[1:27:14] said let there be light and there was
[1:27:16] light why not use that one that's a
[1:27:17] wonderful scripture
[1:27:19] what do what what about using the one
[1:27:20] where god said let us make man in our
[1:27:22] own image and after the image of god
[1:27:23] made him after the likeness of god made
[1:27:25] him male and female created either is
[1:27:26] that a wonderful scripture what about
[1:27:28] genesis 3 15 that he would send the
[1:27:30] serpent versus one i use that one that's
[1:27:32] a wonderful scripture why not use
[1:27:34] deuteronomy 18 15 behold the lord your
[1:27:35] god shall raise up a prophet like an
[1:27:37] unto me why not zechariah 12 6 the man
[1:27:39] whose name is the bravest what about
[1:27:41] haggai 27 the man who is the desire of
[1:27:43] the nations what about psalms 22 1 my
[1:27:45] god my god why is that forsaken me all
[1:27:47] of those scriptures are pertaining to
[1:27:49] him
[1:27:50] but he not only had word he had
[1:27:52] leadership to know what scripture to use
[1:27:58] [Applause]
[1:28:06] now watch him just strip him down
[1:28:14] thou shall worship the lord thy god
[1:28:18] and him only shalt thou serve amen you
[1:28:21] are a creature and may i add
[1:28:23] a creature of time
[1:28:32] and i do not believe in worshiping
[1:28:33] creatures
[1:28:34] or creation
[1:28:37] which paul said in the book of romans
[1:28:38] that they would do in the last days
[1:28:40] worship the creature more than the
[1:28:41] creator
[1:28:45] but daryl tell me the other day and
[1:28:46] preach the sermon here's just a week or
[1:28:48] so ago about about selfies and every
[1:28:50] year there's a dictionary where the in
[1:28:51] the united states and different parts of
[1:28:52] the world they had a new word a word of
[1:28:54] emphasis you know and they pick one for
[1:28:55] the united states and then they pick one
[1:28:57] for different parts of the world but the
[1:28:58] one word they use for american different
[1:29:00] parts of the world was the word selfie
[1:29:03] because people are getting so tied up on
[1:29:05] their self taking pictures of the self
[1:29:07] and now they got therapy for people that
[1:29:10] are so involved in selfies
[1:29:12] they cannot keep from taking pictures of
[1:29:15] themselves and one of the therapy the
[1:29:17] way they start out with the therapy of
[1:29:19] sending these people through the therapy
[1:29:21] of selfies is being able to get them to
[1:29:23] not make a picture of themselves for 30
[1:29:25] minutes and then they move it up for an
[1:29:27] hour i'll tell one thing i'm not sure
[1:29:28] what they say about their self but i
[1:29:30] don't see it myself
[1:29:32] oh goodness what i see in myself is the
[1:29:35] greatest enemy that i've got
[1:29:37] what i see in myself is the person who's
[1:29:40] kept me from getting close to god the
[1:29:42] person who has hindered me my life has
[1:29:45] been my selfie
[1:29:52] what is it friend it's an age of self
[1:29:55] love it is an age when people are so
[1:29:58] wrapped up in the self don't you see
[1:29:59] what that testifies to the headship of
[1:30:02] satan
[1:30:03] ready to come to the body because that's
[1:30:05] the way he is he don't love his people
[1:30:08] he don't love his demons
[1:30:11] he's the only one
[1:30:14] that he's concerned
[1:30:18] about if satan's got an iphone he's
[1:30:21] loaded her down with selfies i guarantee
[1:30:23] you
[1:30:27] imagine out of hell every day here comes
[1:30:29] he's selfish all these demons and demons
[1:30:31] saying good lord i get so sick and tired
[1:30:33] of seeing this selfies of the devil
[1:30:34] selfies of the devil here he's got one
[1:30:36] from this angle and one from that angle
[1:30:38] he's frowning and he's smiling he's got
[1:30:39] all this kind of why because everything
[1:30:41] is built around him
[1:30:43] he will sit in the temple of god showing
[1:30:45] himself that he is god
[1:30:54] so you can imagine my sermons i just go
[1:30:56] so well in this age
[1:30:59] living in an age of selfie and i'm
[1:31:00] saying you better deny yourself if you
[1:31:01] want to go to heaven
[1:31:05] and people just click out of curiosity
[1:31:07] and go over halfway in the sermon you
[1:31:08] all say dear lord
[1:31:10] how do them poor people stand that guy
[1:31:12] oh that's a marvel to me as well but
[1:31:16] i can't believe here we are
[1:31:17] we're teaching and i try to be
[1:31:18] everything you could be my do this and
[1:31:20] do all of that and i'm saying you better
[1:31:22] pray about all that
[1:31:24] i told you last time some of you didn't
[1:31:25] like it but i'm gonna say it again some
[1:31:27] of you tell your kids oh you can be the
[1:31:28] best at this and you can do this and
[1:31:29] that and the other and you're feeding a
[1:31:31] bunch of lies into their mind
[1:31:32] first of all how do you know they can be
[1:31:34] the best and there's eight million kids
[1:31:36] out there just like yours is even better
[1:31:37] you're telling them a lie
[1:31:40] you won't tell them there's a santa
[1:31:41] claus and you shouldn't but you'll tell
[1:31:42] them they can be the best at this and
[1:31:44] the best of them sometimes you're lying
[1:31:45] to them kids and you'll give them an
[1:31:47] attitude over the dawn they need help
[1:31:49] they need help they need help to learn
[1:31:51] how to die
[1:31:52] they don't need help to build up their
[1:31:54] ego build up self self self self sal
[1:31:57] what are you doing to them kids
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:11] but brother donnie if we don't tell our
[1:32:12] kids how great and how wonderful don't
[1:32:14] ever amount to nothing that is a lie
[1:32:17] i'm a living example standing before you
[1:32:19] today
[1:32:21] amen
[1:32:23] i was never encouraged that i'd be
[1:32:24] anything as a matter of fact i was told
[1:32:25] i'd be nothing
[1:32:27] stupid ignorant
[1:32:32] that i'd never announce anything
[1:32:35] when i started preaching in pentecost
[1:32:36] preachers would get me up in the church
[1:32:38] after i preached that day and said if
[1:32:40] you're a preacher of the woods is full
[1:32:41] of them
[1:32:48] self-esteem
[1:32:50] ego
[1:32:51] ambition
[1:32:53] trash heap
[1:32:56] but there's something in me bigger than
[1:32:57] the words of my daddy
[1:32:59] there's something in me bigger than the
[1:33:01] words of pentecostal preachers you'll
[1:33:03] never amount to nothing boy you're not
[1:33:04] this you're not that the other all i
[1:33:06] knew is there's something inside of me
[1:33:08] bigger than i'd hurt all of my life
[1:33:10] and i refuse to let that get me down i
[1:33:14] refuse to let that but i can tell you of
[1:33:16] others who were constantly uplifted
[1:33:18] uplifted uplifted by the parents
[1:33:20] uplifted uplifted uplifted by the
[1:33:22] parents don't you see what you're doing
[1:33:23] you're feeding that spirit that's on
[1:33:25] that child
[1:33:26] you'll never overcome that by giving
[1:33:29] that spirit what it wants you've got to
[1:33:31] help that child to grow up
[1:33:34] and you're not doing it by feeding it
[1:33:38] [Applause]
[1:33:46] well glory
[1:33:53] you never graduate at the top of your
[1:33:55] class
[1:33:55] i never graduated
[1:34:00] you're kidding me i'm not
[1:34:02] you mean you didn't graduate
[1:34:03] kindergarten they didn't graduate
[1:34:05] kindergarten when i went
[1:34:07] but now i graduate kindergarten first
[1:34:09] grade second grade third grade in
[1:34:10] between grades summer school class
[1:34:12] graduate graduate graduate my lord my
[1:34:13] grandkids have had more graduation i've
[1:34:15] had i'm 58 years old
[1:34:19] you're laughing at me but i want you to
[1:34:21] think what's that doing to them
[1:34:30] but your parents have got it in your
[1:34:31] mind that's what you've got to do to
[1:34:32] make them better christians really
[1:34:34] and where is that example in the
[1:34:35] scripture in the message of the hour
[1:34:37] you've accepted a bunch of communism and
[1:34:39] socialism into your mind of what you
[1:34:41] think you've got to make them kids train
[1:34:43] them up and the way they should go
[1:34:45] not the way you think they ought to go
[1:34:47] and then have me to change them once
[1:34:48] they get saved train them about the way
[1:34:50] they should go in the way of humility
[1:34:52] not arrogance and pride
[1:34:55] [Applause]
[1:35:04] well no doubt that was for some of the
[1:35:05] norwegians or
[1:35:07] maybe for some of the folks down in
[1:35:09] brazil or
[1:35:10] some of the folks from over in africa i
[1:35:11] know it wasn't for none of you little
[1:35:13] darlings here
[1:35:20] so he looks right at him
[1:35:22] and he says satan
[1:35:27] do you understand a man or woman who has
[1:35:29] authority
[1:35:31] and know their position
[1:35:33] it's not how loud you scream
[1:35:37] i've been given by almighty god the
[1:35:39] authority to cast out devils
[1:35:43] i don't even have to raise my voice
[1:35:46] i could whisper to that devil
[1:35:49] and if your faith in mine is right he'll
[1:35:51] leave
[1:35:52] but because some of you think it's the
[1:35:54] volume of my voice sometimes i'll only
[1:35:57] deafen you that's for your face it ain't
[1:35:59] for mine
[1:36:01] because i know all i have to do is speak
[1:36:03] to him and if the conditions are right
[1:36:05] he will leave
[1:36:08] authority is not volume
[1:36:12] authority is not so loud that
[1:36:13] everybody's saying they're shaking and
[1:36:15] quivering not under the power of god but
[1:36:16] because the speakers are so loud that is
[1:36:18] not authority authority is knowing who
[1:36:21] you are knowing you've been anointed by
[1:36:23] the presence of god and you're not going
[1:36:25] to back up
[1:36:28] and here was jesus your imaginableness
[1:36:30] come out of his mouth saying god oh no
[1:36:32] oh no
[1:36:33] this ain't david this ain't moses this
[1:36:35] ain't achin this ain't either saint adam
[1:36:38] satan
[1:36:40] amen
[1:36:46] whatever we worship
[1:36:50] is the god we serve
[1:36:56] and if you feel more passion
[1:36:59] and more movement in your being toward
[1:37:01] money
[1:37:02] than you do god
[1:37:04] that is your god
[1:37:08] i can preach on the cross some of you
[1:37:09] never cry and preach on the resurrection
[1:37:10] you never shout i can preach on the
[1:37:12] second coming of the lord you never move
[1:37:14] but if the dollar lost three quarters of
[1:37:17] its amount
[1:37:18] today while we were in church and you
[1:37:20] read that after church on your
[1:37:21] smartphone and you said dear god i'm
[1:37:24] broke
[1:37:26] there's your god
[1:37:27] [Applause]
[1:37:31] oh god
[1:37:32] what are you doing it's connected so
[1:37:34] deep to your emotions you fall all to
[1:37:36] pieces the cross never moved you the
[1:37:38] resurrection never moved you the comet
[1:37:40] of the lord never moved you but your
[1:37:41] money moves yeah
[1:37:43] some of you are moved by your kids
[1:37:45] playing ball games you're moved by this
[1:37:46] and that and the other whatever you
[1:37:48] worship that is your god and jesus said
[1:37:51] thou shalt worship the lord thy god
[1:38:00] matthew chapter 4 verse 11
[1:38:05] i really like this verse
[1:38:09] then the devil
[1:38:11] leaveth him
[1:38:13] i don't know about you i need a lot of
[1:38:15] this verse 11 in my life
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:22] now jesus never had a devil and the
[1:38:23] devil wasn't in him but the devil just
[1:38:25] left away from where he was he couldn't
[1:38:26] handle that word
[1:38:28] i mean it finally reached your place in
[1:38:29] amazing the first temptation the devil
[1:38:31] never left second temptation the devil
[1:38:32] never left that there must have been a
[1:38:34] determination there must have been a
[1:38:36] sound in his voice there must have been
[1:38:38] something there that satan said i'm out
[1:38:40] of here
[1:38:46] his first assault
[1:38:48] is for his appetite
[1:38:51] the lust of the flesh
[1:38:54] second assault
[1:38:56] glory pride
[1:38:59] lust of the eyes
[1:39:01] third assault ambition
[1:39:04] the pride of life
[1:39:08] jesus met all three
[1:39:10] with the word
[1:39:12] now let me just
[1:39:13] take just a couple minutes
[1:39:16] submission
[1:39:18] empowers us
[1:39:20] to resist
[1:39:22] satan's lies
[1:39:24] james chapter 4 verse 7
[1:39:27] submit
[1:39:29] yourselves therefore
[1:39:32] to god
[1:39:34] resist
[1:39:35] the devil
[1:39:38] and after 40 days
[1:39:40] he will think about or pray about
[1:39:44] happy valley church do you believe this
[1:39:47] scripture
[1:39:48] is the word of god
[1:39:51] no ifs no hands no perhaps no commas
[1:39:55] if we will submit ourselves to god and
[1:39:58] resist the devil this is god's promise
[1:40:02] he will flee i don't care brothers what
[1:40:03] he's tempting you to do if you will
[1:40:06] resist him and resist him and resist him
[1:40:09] it is god's word you don't have to flee
[1:40:11] he will
[1:40:13] oh but you say this smoke in this drink
[1:40:15] and i i can't do it you're believing a
[1:40:17] lie of the devil
[1:40:19] he is tempting you and tempting you and
[1:40:22] tempting you and he is weighing out your
[1:40:24] resistance
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:29] submission
[1:40:31] empowers
[1:40:35] as i was us studying yesterday and the
[1:40:37] lord god
[1:40:38] came to where i was
[1:40:40] and he spoke these words to me
[1:40:43] submission
[1:40:45] empowers
[1:40:47] to resist
[1:40:51] the word is a military term the word
[1:40:54] that james uses submit yourselves
[1:40:57] the word is a military term that means
[1:41:01] get into your proper rank
[1:41:09] so if you're a buck private quit trying
[1:41:10] to be the pastor
[1:41:17] this is one reason friends we can't
[1:41:18] overcome we're not in our place
[1:41:22] you second guess the prophet you second
[1:41:23] against the preachers you're second
[1:41:24] getting everything going on why it's
[1:41:26] because you have exalted yourself to a
[1:41:29] position above god's generals
[1:41:32] in your thinking you know how to run a
[1:41:35] church better than god call men do
[1:41:38] and then you wonder why you can't
[1:41:39] overcome you are empowered
[1:41:43] by submission not submission to me
[1:41:45] submission to god
[1:41:54] so get into your proper rank
[1:41:59] so you imagine a guy goes down to the
[1:42:00] office tomorrow and he wants to join up
[1:42:03] well they tell him to report over camp
[1:42:05] lejeune or wherever they do all this
[1:42:07] training stuff you know man he walks in
[1:42:09] all right guys
[1:42:10] here i am
[1:42:12] i want to start out i want to be a
[1:42:14] five-star general matter of fact i think
[1:42:16] i'll be advisor to president obama i'll
[1:42:18] tell you one thing i want to go over to
[1:42:20] iraq i'm going to show them how
[1:42:21] tennessee boy will clean up this mess
[1:42:24] let me out of that hillbilly i may walk
[1:42:26] one-sided cause i'm on them hills down
[1:42:28] there and i know how to straighten out
[1:42:29] the world's problems
[1:42:33] and you imagine that sergeant as he
[1:42:34] looks at you and they say i'm gonna make
[1:42:36] you look like cat food
[1:42:40] i love getting people like you
[1:42:43] oh
[1:42:44] his toenails go to turning up in his
[1:42:46] toes and he said i can't wait
[1:42:51] [Music]
[1:42:59] and you've got some pretty curls hanging
[1:43:00] down there that was so attractive to the
[1:43:02] girls
[1:43:10] come in with your pink tennis shoes on
[1:43:13] and your gold chains
[1:43:20] and you say i want to be in the marines
[1:43:24] come on in
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:30] [Laughter]
[1:43:34] and then you walk out there one thing i
[1:43:35] think army look better for our pink
[1:43:37] tennis shoes and i believe one thing i
[1:43:39] believe a man would fight better fed
[1:43:40] longer i believe by the time you get out
[1:43:42] of solitary
[1:43:49] you might think twice before you open
[1:43:50] that thing and run it wide open
[1:43:57] submission
[1:43:58] how did jesus overcome this remember
[1:44:01] as the weakest christian
[1:44:07] but being jehovah's servant
[1:44:10] satan is trying to pull him out of
[1:44:12] jehovah's servant post of duty
[1:44:16] in his first temptation command these
[1:44:18] stones to be made bread don't you see
[1:44:19] what he's trying to do break rank
[1:44:25] now he's trying to get him to move out
[1:44:26] of servant position and servant attitude
[1:44:29] back into logos
[1:44:37] let's stand
[1:44:53] unconditional surrender
[1:44:56] is the only way
[1:44:58] to complete
[1:45:00] victory
[1:45:04] unconditional surrender
[1:45:06] in his own way jesus showed us this
[1:45:08] example
[1:45:09] this is how jesus fought remember i told
[1:45:11] you last night the celtics the
[1:45:13] bethenians the scythians the romans the
[1:45:16] greeks
[1:45:17] but especially with the romans
[1:45:19] they wanted to train every soldier but
[1:45:21] they would fight the same
[1:45:23] so whether you seen one or 10 or 50 or 5
[1:45:26] 000 roman soldiers you'd know who they
[1:45:28] were by the way they fought
[1:45:31] they were not trained in the mentality
[1:45:33] of being soldiers and heroes on the
[1:45:35] battlefield
[1:45:36] they wanted to live
[1:45:39] because they would give them a large
[1:45:41] salary
[1:45:43] and a large tract of land
[1:45:45] if they lived when the war was over
[1:45:48] so they would worry about a medal of
[1:45:49] honor so to speak that wasn't worried
[1:45:51] about having a big name they wanted to
[1:45:53] live
[1:45:54] that's where i am
[1:45:56] i want to survive
[1:45:58] praise god
[1:45:59] i'll get my reward after sometime else i
[1:46:02] want to come through this war on the
[1:46:03] other side
[1:46:04] so whether you saw one if one roman
[1:46:06] soldier was out there by himself and he
[1:46:08] was bushwhacked and he got tied back
[1:46:10] there if there was one or five thousand
[1:46:12] you knew that man was a roman by the way
[1:46:14] that he fought
[1:46:15] they had their door which was called
[1:46:17] their shield
[1:46:18] two by six foot
[1:46:22] those of you who watch ben hur and you
[1:46:24] watch the different ones of the roman
[1:46:26] soldiers fighting it's contrary to
[1:46:27] history the way hollywood projects them
[1:46:30] they do not come out like this and open
[1:46:32] it up and use the sword the shield is
[1:46:34] decoration
[1:46:36] they stayed behind their door
[1:46:39] and only when they would peep from
[1:46:41] around their door and see the head of
[1:46:43] the enemy come around would they move
[1:46:45] and jab their enemy
[1:46:47] because they knew that door as they
[1:46:49] called it
[1:46:50] was their protection
[1:46:53] reminds you that our lord jesus said i
[1:46:56] am the door
[1:46:58] he is your door stay behind him
[1:47:05] so jesus totally submitted to god the
[1:47:08] father
[1:47:10] and this is the way you overcome
[1:47:12] in animation jesus didn't argue with the
[1:47:14] devil
[1:47:15] he doesn't debate with him
[1:47:17] i'll tell you one thing saying glory to
[1:47:19] god i'm the word don't you know this
[1:47:20] devil that you're going to hell you're
[1:47:22] going i created you you ain't nothing
[1:47:24] but a shut down devil i'm going to
[1:47:25] preach your assignment
[1:47:31] how much of our time in life have we
[1:47:33] wasted by talking to him
[1:47:37] and at the end of the day he was still
[1:47:39] the devil and you were still the son of
[1:47:41] god order of god
[1:47:43] and what did you do wasted the entire
[1:47:45] day
[1:47:48] arguing and fussing with the biggest
[1:47:49] foster that's ever been
[1:47:53] did you convince him
[1:47:55] at the end of the day did you make an
[1:47:56] altar call let the devil to revenge
[1:47:59] did you baptize him i missed it if you
[1:48:01] did
[1:48:03] you wasted your time
[1:48:06] stay with the word stay your place
[1:48:09] resist him and he will flee
[1:48:12] and the word flee is to run with caution
[1:48:15] to get away for your life
[1:48:22] now if i said that in a charismatic
[1:48:24] church this morning they've been hanging
[1:48:25] off the chandeliers and y'all standing
[1:48:26] there looking at me
[1:48:32] don't you believe this
[1:48:35] do you believe that's what god's word
[1:48:37] says oh that devil's been aggravating me
[1:48:39] all day because you led him
[1:48:41] according to the word of god submit
[1:48:43] yourself to god and resist the devil and
[1:48:46] he will run for his life
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:54] amen
[1:48:56] brother brad maybe
[1:49:00] we should kind of
[1:49:02] show these people
[1:49:05] the way they let satan intimidate them
[1:49:11] but in their mind the way
[1:49:14] they think that he is
[1:49:17] it says the way god's word says he is
[1:49:19] [Music]
[1:49:25] tell us big boy
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:39] can i go to
[1:49:40] heaven
[1:49:42] seed
[1:49:43] you're lost
[1:49:45] there's no hope for you
[1:49:47] i've got you
[1:49:48] you're defeated
[1:49:50] you're going to hell
[1:50:04] the bible says he goes forth as
[1:50:07] a roaring mind
[1:50:11] but to a real son of god instead of
[1:50:13] being like that or daughter of god he's
[1:50:17] [Music]
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:50:32] [Laughter]
[1:50:33] [Applause]
[1:50:36] it depends on which one you believe he
[1:50:39] is
[1:50:48] we go to baptism today let him come and
[1:50:49] prepare for that
[1:50:51] so how are you going to walk out of here
[1:50:52] today
[1:50:54] like this big ferocious king
[1:50:57] of the jungle
[1:50:59] or
[1:51:04] showing not acknowledge he's a great
[1:51:06] enemy absolutely
[1:51:08] silly not acknowledge he's got a
[1:51:09] position sure
[1:51:12] but also acknowledge when you do the
[1:51:13] word of god instead of him being like
[1:51:15] that
[1:51:17] he's like this
[1:51:22] why would that lion run from me

[1:54:24] would be said or given to these people
[1:54:27] that would help them to meet the
[1:54:28] challenge of this day

[1:54:47] to the
[1:54:48] coliseum
[1:54:50] nero loved gardens so we're told
[1:54:53] and he loved to get out in the darkness
[1:54:55] of the night and walk through his garden
[1:54:58] we were also told they would take
[1:54:59] christians
[1:55:00] filled with the holy ghost
[1:55:03] wrap them in a certain type of cloths
[1:55:05] poor tyre pitch
[1:55:07] all over their bodies
[1:55:09] and they would use them in human torches
[1:55:12] as the hero would walk through his
[1:55:13] garden
[1:55:16] our brothers and sisters
[1:55:18] how could they ever face such a death
[1:55:21] they were anointed

[1:55:28] to stand to this day
[1:55:31] and face the hell that we have to go
[1:55:33] through
[1:55:34] but lord we don't want to be survivors

[1:57:39] dear lord
[1:57:41] every time i see someone come so young
[1:57:44] thank you jesus

[1:57:47] do they really
[1:57:48] have a full understanding of what
[1:57:51] they're actually doing undoubtedly
[1:57:53] they can't completely get it
[1:57:55] but i pray for this little soul here

[1:57:58] i pray that you would open his eyes
[1:58:01] give him a revelation of exactly what's
[1:58:03] going on i pray that this be the only
[1:58:06] time he ever do this because after this
[1:58:09] dedication
[1:58:10] he walks on in your promise which means
[1:58:13] as a at a young age that he walks up
[1:58:16] gets up from this baptism he walks on to
[1:58:19] the baptism of the holy ghost and spends
[1:58:21] the rest of his days living for you dear

[1:58:32] believe in the holy ghost we still
[1:58:34] believe in power of baptism we still
[1:58:36] believe in a real genuine death to self
[1:58:39] thank you for it lord i pray for my
[1:58:41] little brother that you help him to see
[1:58:42] it for the rest of his days and walk on
[1:58:45] in your word to a rapture we know that
