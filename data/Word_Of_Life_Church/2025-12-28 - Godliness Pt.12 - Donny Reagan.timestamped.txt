[32:57] The sleeping [music] child, your whole
[33:00] [singing] name

[33:04] [music]

[33:08] [music]
[33:16] [singing]
[33:18] [music]
[33:24] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[33:26] [music]
[33:29] &gt;&gt; The dead will hear. [singing] The dead
[33:33] will live [music] again.
[33:40] [music and singing]
[33:43] He's
[33:45] a great [music and singing]
[33:53] [music] I know he's a great
[33:59] [singing]
[34:02] [music]
[34:03] man.
[34:07] He's the great [singing] I
[34:12] am.
[34:15] [singing]
[34:18] Oh, [music]
[34:21] he's [singing] the great I
[34:25] am. [singing]
[34:29] [music]
[34:35] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[34:53] &gt;&gt; stand together. [clears throat]
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you know?
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's wonderful to talk
[35:02] about history and talk about what people
[35:05] didn't know. But I'm so glad that we
[35:06] know today.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; He's not the second person of a godhead,
[35:11] &gt;&gt; but he's actually the godhead made
[35:14] manifest.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, I don't know
[35:17] about you, it seems like it's been
[35:18] forever since we've been in church.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; How How can one week be so long by just
[35:25] not having church on Wednesday?
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But thank the Lord. But was able
[35:28] to have it twice this week. Tonight and
[35:30] in the morning. So good. Thank the Lord
[35:32] for that. How many come with expectation
[35:34] in your heart tonight. Brother Daryl's
[35:36] going to come and speak for us. And then
[35:38] we're going to have communion and and
[35:40] footwashing. And [clears throat] I know
[35:41] there's several saints in our in our
[35:45] church that need healing. And I want to
[35:47] remind you of what we've been taught in
[35:49] the message of the hour, which was taken
[35:52] from the book of Exodus, that there is
[35:55] healing in the communion.
[35:58] Brother Donnie, I've got this and that
[36:00] and the other. I know that we've got a
[36:01] lot of needs. But can you imagine some
[36:04] of them old people down the land of
[36:06] Egypt? They were crippled. They were
[36:08] halt. They were maimed. All kinds of
[36:10] things wrong with them. But when they
[36:12] ate that lamb, they came out of there
[36:14] changed. And I believe as we put this
[36:17] little piece of bread in our mouths
[36:19] tonight by faith in the promised word
[36:21] and the little symbol of the wine, God's
[36:24] healing power is just as real tonight.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Can we say it's good to be together in
[36:31] the house of the Lord?
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank the Lord. We just want to
[36:34] invite Brother Daryl to come and bring
[36:36] to us what the Lord's placed on his
[36:38] heart. And we just open our hearts to
[36:40] that. How many has a need? I'm sure you
[36:42] do. All of us do.
[36:44] Let's just sing together. He touched me,
[36:46] Harry.
[36:48] No matter how many years that were
[36:51] around God's word and truth, there's one
[36:53] simple fact to be able to reach him,
[36:56] touch [music] him by your faith.
[36:59] If we can do that no matter what we have
[37:02] need of as it was pinned so many years
[37:05] ago. I was shackled
[37:10] by a head [singing]
[37:13] feed [music]
[37:19] me
[37:22] a [music and singing] load of guilt
[37:26] and shame.
[37:29] Thank you [music] Lord.
[37:31] Oh but then [singing]
[37:34] the hand of my Jesus
[37:37] you remember
[37:38] he [music] touched me
[37:44] and now
[37:46] I am [music and singing] no longer
[37:49] the same. Everybody now [music] brother
[37:52] Daryl to come.
[37:55] Oh,
[38:02] [music]
[38:09] [music]
[38:12] heat, heat.
[38:17] [music]
[38:25] And now [music]
[38:31] he touched me
[38:34] and
[38:36] [music]
[38:41] Amen. Aren't you grateful for the touch
[38:44] of the Lord Jesus?
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; You know, here a few years ago, I was
[38:49] preaching up in
[38:51] New Mexico, Brother Emanuel Salazars,
[38:54] and my back had went out on me. I spent
[38:58] two days in a hotel room laying on the
[39:00] floor with my feet up in a chair.
[39:04] So, I was to preach a certain night and
[39:06] brother Joe [music] Forny was in those
[39:07] meetings with me and he said, "Let me
[39:09] take your service tonight and you can
[39:11] have my service and I'd give you a
[39:12] couple more days." And I said, "Well,
[39:14] I'll just pray about it." And so I was
[39:16] praying and so I I text brother Juel
[39:18] back and said, "Brother Joel, I'm going
[39:19] to take the service tonight." He just
[39:20] text back and he goes, "Oh man."
[39:23] And it was all I could do to get to the
[39:24] pool pit. Matter of fact, when I got to
[39:27] the church, I had to climb steps to get
[39:29] up to the study. And when Brother
[39:31] Emanuel left to go down to give me a few
[39:34] minutes to myself, I laid on the floor
[39:35] of his study and put my took my shoes
[39:37] off, put my feet up on the couch cuz I
[39:39] was hurting so bad. And I got down to
[39:42] the pull pit. It was It was all I could
[39:44] do. God knows the truth to get one leg
[39:46] in front of the other. And I remember
[39:49] there in the study and I was just
[39:52] talking to the Lord and I said, "Lord,
[39:55] please don't make me stand in front of
[39:56] your people like this."
[40:00] And I got to the pull pit and I was just
[40:02] holding on to it cuz I was hurting so
[40:04] bad. And
[40:06] Sister Cindy Hunt and Brother David was
[40:08] in those services.
[40:11] And I was standing there and all of a
[40:14] sudden I felt a hand touch me on my
[40:16] back.
[40:18] And you know all the time have
[40:21] microphone trouble when I preach. So I
[40:23] thought for sure it was the song leader
[40:24] telling me that my mic wasn't working.
[40:27] And when I turned around to look behind
[40:28] me there was no one there. And I thought
[40:31] that was strange. And when I turned back
[40:33] around to face the people there's like
[40:35] two warm vials of water just came down
[40:38] my legs. We had a prayer line that night
[40:44] just [applause]
[40:51] there's just something
[40:53] &gt;&gt; about his touch.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We trust you had a
[40:57] wonderful Christmas and certainly count
[40:59] an honor to be here and to take this
[41:01] service. And if you have your Bibles
[41:03] this evening, turn with me to the book
[41:04] of Psalms. We're going to read from
[41:06] Psalms 63, just one verse there, verse
[41:08] one. And we trust this will be a
[41:10] blessing to you tonight. It's just a a
[41:12] real simple thought because really
[41:14] that's the only kind I can preach. We
[41:16] trust it'll be a blessing to you.
[41:20] Just looking forward to the communion
[41:21] service. Amen.
[41:24] Psalm 63:1.
[41:36] The Bible says this,
[41:39] a psalm of David when he was in the
[41:41] wilderness of Judah
[41:43] said, "Oh God,
[41:46] thou art my God.
[41:48] Early will I seek thee.
[41:51] My soul thirsteth for thee.
[41:54] My flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
[41:58] thirsty land
[42:00] where no water is."
[42:03] Let's bow our heads. [snorts]
[42:07] I want to speak to you for just a few
[42:08] minutes this evening before the
[42:09] communion service on. We have found him
[42:12] who our hearts have thirsted for.
[42:16] We have found him in whom our hearts
[42:19] have thirsted for.
[42:22] Heavenly Father, we are grateful tonight
[42:26] Lord for all that you have done for us.
[42:30] And Lord, we thank you for this
[42:31] opportunity together here in your name.
[42:34] And father, we pray tonight that your
[42:36] anointing would come upon every one of
[42:38] us, dear God. That we could have a true
[42:41] communion, Lord, with you. [snorts] But
[42:43] Father God, we pray tonight that these
[42:45] simple little thought would stir our
[42:47] hearts, Lord, and prepare us for this
[42:49] communion service. Heal our sick, Lord,
[42:52] and strengthen our weak. We pray,
[42:54] [snorts] encourage those that would be
[42:56] discouraged, dear God. And as we move
[42:58] forward into a new year, may our desire
[43:01] to be, oh God, as a surrendered vessel
[43:04] that you could use us for your glory. We
[43:06] commit this congregation and oursel into
[43:09] your hands for your glory. For we ask
[43:11] these things in Jesus name. And the
[43:13] bride says,
[43:14] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. May be seated.
[43:19] You know, when you spend time reading
[43:21] the book of Psalms, you come to
[43:23] understand that David being a Psalmsist
[43:26] was exceptionally skilled at expressing
[43:29] his feelings. The ability to pour out
[43:32] his raw, honest emotions.
[43:36] You realize that David had the ability
[43:38] to take life experiences and convey them
[43:41] into a psalm or into a song to express
[43:44] what he was feeling to his God.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we find here in
[43:48] Psalm 63:1. David desired to know God,
[43:52] to find God. And he likened this desire
[43:55] to know God as a thirst. And David said,
[43:57] "My soul thirsteth for thee." As in a
[44:00] dry land where there's no water. And
[44:02] David said, "My soul is so thirsty, God.
[44:05] I'm thirsting for you." Just just like I
[44:07] was in a land where there's there's no
[44:09] water. Like a person lost in the desert
[44:11] and it's hot and dry and weary and your
[44:14] skin's burdened. Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; And to be in a situation to where you
[44:19] just cry out, I've got to have water.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Or I'll perish. My soul, David said,
[44:25] Lord, that that's the way I feel and
[44:27] that's the way I'm trying to describe it
[44:28] to you is my soul is thirsty for thee.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; You know, years ago when I was a young
[44:34] man, I was in the army and I was in
[44:37] basic training in Fort Steel, Oklahoma.
[44:40] I was only 17 years old at the time and
[44:43] we was going on maneuvers and they
[44:45] ordered us all to get water in our
[44:47] cantens and there was so many boys
[44:51] trying to get water in their cantens
[44:52] that by the time they called the forest
[44:54] together into formation
[44:57] I didn't get the water.
[45:00] So we got out there and it was I was
[45:01] there in in June, July, August,
[45:04] September in in those months. I turned
[45:06] 18 in September of that year. But and it
[45:09] was extremely hot and we was out there
[45:10] and sweating and I got so thirsty
[45:15] and even that my my tongue began to feel
[45:18] like it was just sticking to my roof of
[45:20] my mouth and I was so thirsty and I
[45:22] didn't have no water and I saw I didn't
[45:25] know who this guy was but I was so
[45:26] thirsty. I said I said please could
[45:29] could I have just a drink of the water
[45:31] from your canteen?
[45:34] and he looked at me
[45:37] and he said, "No."
[45:41] And I'll tell you, [snorts]
[45:44] when I got to where I could find water,
[45:47] I was so thirsty that I drank and I
[45:51] drank and I drank and I could understand
[45:54] how David was feeling here. He said, "My
[45:56] desire to know you, God."
[45:59] &gt;&gt; It's like being in a land where there's
[46:01] no water.
[46:03] Another example of David's ability to
[46:05] convey what he was feeling is found in
[46:06] Psalms 119:83.
[46:09] He said, "For I have become like a
[46:10] bottle in the smoke, yet do I not forget
[46:14] thy statues."
[46:16] You see, in the bottles in the east were
[46:18] commonly made of skins, wine skin
[46:21] bottles. And in the small the peasantry
[46:24] dwellings for security and to get them
[46:27] out of the way, they would suspend them
[46:29] from the ceiling or hang them up against
[46:31] the wall. And these humble dwellings
[46:33] that these poor people had, they didn't
[46:34] have chimneys, so they just kind of had
[46:36] a hole where the smoke would go out and
[46:38] as the bottles would hang there, they
[46:41] would get black and they would begin to
[46:44] dry and they would they would become sy
[46:46] and cracked because they was in the
[46:48] smoke and they was in the heat. And
[46:50] David having to seen seen these bottles
[46:52] in that condition.
[46:54] So [snorts] when he finds himself in the
[46:56] midst of his trials, he remembered what
[46:59] those bottles looked like and he used
[47:00] them as an analogy or a means of
[47:03] expression of what he was feeling. Hence
[47:06] he said of himself, I I have become
[47:09] because of my trouble, because of my
[47:11] afflictions, my trials, my persecutions.
[47:13] He said, I'm just like that bottle in
[47:15] the smoke. In the midst of all my
[47:18] troubles, David said, "Though I'm like
[47:20] that bottle in the smoke, yet I do not
[47:24] forget thy statues, oh God."
[47:28] &gt;&gt; David's ability to express himself about
[47:31] thirst is once again found in Psalms 42.
[47:34] said to the chief musician Masquiteth
[47:39] after the waterbrooks so painth my soul
[47:42] after thee oh God my soul thirsteth for
[47:46] God for the living God
[47:48] when shall I come and appear before God
[47:52] thirsty is is a habit or showing a
[47:54] strong desire of something that David
[47:56] uses these terms because he had a strong
[47:59] desire to have fellowship to have true
[48:02] communion with God because you See, true
[48:04] communion is not just you doing all the
[48:06] talking, but true communion is you
[48:08] talking to God and God talking back to
[48:10] you. And David longed for that
[48:12] communion.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; David being a man that lived out in the
[48:16] woods and he learned a lot about the
[48:18] wildlife. And back in those countries,
[48:19] you know, the prophet said they had wild
[48:21] dogs or wolves and they would attack
[48:23] these deer and sometimes they would just
[48:25] wound them. And David's seeing the poor
[48:28] little deer there in such a wounded
[48:30] condition. And he watched that deer
[48:31] trying to get to water.
[48:34] And David said, "I'm just like that
[48:36] deer.
[48:38] I must find that water or perish. If I
[48:40] if he doesn't get the water, he's going
[48:42] to die. He's going to die. And the
[48:43] hounds of hell are after him." David
[48:46] said, "It's just like me. I've got to
[48:49] find God somewhere."
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:52] as a dear thirst for the water book. So
[48:54] my soul thirst after thee, oh God, I
[48:59] have to have you or I'll die. As I was
[49:01] studying as I thought of the young man
[49:03] that come to the altar last Sunday and
[49:04] said, "I've got to have it. I can't go
[49:06] another day without it." But that's when
[49:08] we find him.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed are they that do hunger
[49:15] and thirst for the waterbrook, for they
[49:18] shall find it. But see what makes a man
[49:22] have such a longing, such a thirst, such
[49:25] a hunger to find God. You see, something
[49:30] has to place that creation to thirst in
[49:33] man.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Something has to put it there. In other
[49:36] words, before there is a creation, there
[49:38] has to be a creator to create the
[49:40] creation.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; And there is a creation in your heart to
[49:43] hunger and thirst for divine healing.
[49:45] God and a God that'll have mercy on you.
[49:47] There's got to be a God somewhere to
[49:49] have that mercy
[49:51] &gt;&gt; that creates that creation. Amen.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Something that you're hungering for.
[49:57] Amen. And as long as human beings search
[50:00] and hunger and thirst and calling for
[50:02] the power of God, there's got to be a
[50:04] power of God somewhere to respond to
[50:06] that. Before there could be a creation,
[50:08] there has to be a creator in there
[50:11] creating that creation. Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; When a man longs to see God, there's got
[50:16] to be somewhere.
[50:18] There's something that created that
[50:20] desire in him.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; A deep calling unto the deep. There's
[50:25] got to be a deep to respond to that
[50:28] because there had to be a deep first
[50:29] there to create that call that's in you.
[50:35] And as we cut through Christmas and
[50:36] studying all these things, I I was
[50:38] thinking on these terms of listening to
[50:40] the tape of why it had to be shepherds
[50:44] and why were the shepherds in the field
[50:46] that glorious night when Christ was
[50:49] born.
[50:51] You see, they were there because it was
[50:53] the lamming season. It was the season
[50:56] when little lambs were born and they
[50:58] were gathered there watching over their
[51:00] flocks to find those lambs when they
[51:02] were born. You see these shepherds was
[51:04] lamb hunters
[51:07] &gt;&gt; and they were there in the fields
[51:09] watching over them in case you know that
[51:11] that they had difficulty in birthing
[51:13] them so that they could find the little
[51:14] ones when they were born and and help
[51:16] the sheep in delivery.
[51:19] Amen. It was the laming season and
[51:22] they're hunting lambs to assist them in
[51:24] difficult times. And the Bible said,
[51:27] "And so it was that while they were
[51:28] there that the days were accomplished
[51:30] that she should be delivered, and she
[51:32] brought forth her firstborn son, and
[51:33] wrapped him in a swaddling cloth, and
[51:35] laid him in a manger, because there was
[51:37] no room for them in the end." And there
[51:39] were in the same country shepherds
[51:41] abiding in the field, keeping watch over
[51:43] their flock by night. And lo, the angel
[51:45] of the Lord came upon them, and the
[51:47] glory of the Lord shone around about
[51:48] them, and they were so afraid. And the
[51:51] angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[51:54] for I bring you good tidings of great
[51:56] joy, which shall be to all people, for
[51:58] unto you is born this day in the city of
[52:01] David, a Savior, which is Christ the
[52:03] Lord." And this shall be a sign unto
[52:06] you. You shall find that babe wrapped in
[52:08] swaddling cloth, lying in a manger, not
[52:11] at the holiday end.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; In a manger. Why? Hallelujah. He was the
[52:17] lamb of God. Amen.
[52:20] And suddenly there was an angel, a
[52:22] multitude of heavenly hosts, praising
[52:24] God, and saying, "Glory to God in the
[52:25] highest and on earth, peace and goodwill
[52:27] towards men. And it came to pass as the
[52:29] angels were gone away from them into
[52:31] heaven." The shepherds said to one
[52:33] another, "Let us go now even to
[52:35] Bethlehem, and see this thing which has
[52:38] come to pass, which the Lord hath made
[52:40] known to us." And they came with haste,
[52:43] and they found him,
[52:45] &gt;&gt; in whom their hearts were thirsting
[52:48] &gt;&gt; for.
[52:50] They found Mary Barry and Joseph and the
[52:52] baby laying in a manger. When they had
[52:55] seen it, they made known abro saying
[52:56] which was told to them concerning this
[52:58] child. We have found him and whom our
[53:01] hearts has thirsted for. Why it had to
[53:04] be shepherds?
[53:06] Who better to announce the birth of the
[53:08] lamb of God than to shepherds who were
[53:11] in who were with their flocks during the
[53:14] birthing season hunting for newborn
[53:16] lambs?
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he come by all nature just
[53:19] like regular lambs are born. He was the
[53:21] lamb of God and he was born along about
[53:24] that time and they were there hungering.
[53:27] There's something in them as shepherds
[53:30] to find lambs
[53:32] &gt;&gt; and they found him
[53:35] &gt;&gt; in a manger.
[53:37] The wise men longing and thirsting and
[53:39] searching to find the one in whom their
[53:42] hearts thirsted for. The Bible said when
[53:45] Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in
[53:47] the days of Herod the king saying where
[53:50] is he that is born king of the Jews? For
[53:52] he have seen his star in the east that
[53:54] are come to worship him. When Herod
[53:57] heard the king when Herod the king had
[53:58] heard these things he was troubled and
[54:00] all Jerusalem with him. And when he
[54:02] gathered all the chief priests and
[54:03] scribes of the people together, he
[54:04] demanded of when this Christ child
[54:06] should be born. And they said unto him,
[54:09] Bethlehem of Judea, for thus as is
[54:11] written by the prophet,
[54:14] and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah,
[54:16] art thou not least among the princes of
[54:17] Judah? For out of thee shall come a
[54:19] governor that shall rule thy people
[54:21] Israel. When Herod had heard privately,
[54:23] then Herod heard, when he had privately
[54:24] called the wise men, inquired of them,
[54:26] diligently of what time that star
[54:28] appeared, and he sent them to Bethlehem,
[54:30] and said, "Go and search diligently for
[54:32] the young child. When you found him,
[54:34] bring me word again that I may come and
[54:35] worship him." And when they had heard
[54:37] the king, they departed. And lo, the
[54:39] star which they saw in the east went
[54:40] before them till it came and stood over
[54:43] where the young child was.
[54:46] Amen. And when they saw the star, they
[54:49] exceedingly rejoiced with they rejoiced
[54:51] with exceedingly great joy. And when
[54:53] they were coming to the house, they saw
[54:55] the young child with Mary, his mother,
[54:57] and fell down and worshiped him. And
[54:59] they opened their treasures and
[55:00] presented unto him gifts of gold and
[55:02] frankincense and myrr. the deity in
[55:06] service for death.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Their gifts proved they had found him.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; In whom their hearts thirsted for
[55:15] &gt;&gt; they had the appropriate gifts to
[55:17] identify him
[55:18] &gt;&gt; on the earth.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; You see, God would reveal himself to
[55:22] those who expected him. Those magi that
[55:24] were expected to see a star of Jacob.
[55:26] They were from the east. They listened
[55:28] to Balam's prophecy which said there
[55:30] would be a star of Jacob rise and they
[55:32] were looking for it. They was expecting
[55:34] it. They were the ones who seen it.
[55:36] Amen. Why? Because they were looking for
[55:38] it.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; You usually get what you expect. The
[55:42] magi were expecting that star. They were
[55:44] watching for it. And when they saw it,
[55:45] they followed it. No one saw it but the
[55:48] magi. Why? Because it was for them.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you wonder why can I see it
[55:56] and my brother can't see it or my mama
[55:58] can't see it or my daddy can't see it or
[56:00] my wife can't see it.
[56:03] But they saw it because it was for them
[56:05] to see it. Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; We have seen his star.
[56:13] But his star wasn't in the east. They
[56:14] were in the east. They were looking
[56:16] westward towards Palestine. And they saw
[56:18] a star and they come to worship him. Oh
[56:22] my. Can you imagine in their hearts when
[56:24] they seen that star appear that they
[56:26] were looking for and they knew he was on
[56:28] the earth. They begin to hunger. They
[56:30] begin to thirst. They gathered their
[56:32] things. They said, "Let's go. We've got
[56:33] to go find him." They got the gold. They
[56:35] got the frankincense. They got the myrr.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; They wanted to do all they could do to
[56:40] worship him, to acknowledge him, to
[56:42] welcome him to the earth. There was a
[56:43] hunger. There was a thirst for this
[56:45] fellowship with this newborn king.
[56:49] Hundreds of miles they journeyed. They
[56:51] had an awful journey. They come over the
[56:53] mountain, sloped off the west side,
[56:54] followed the great Tigress River on down
[56:56] till they hit the land of Sar. They
[56:59] crossed by the fort perhaps down there,
[57:01] the river of Euphrates and journeyied on
[57:02] through Sahara. They probably had to
[57:04] travel by night because it was so hot in
[57:06] the daytime. And then again, they had to
[57:08] follow that star and it was only shining
[57:09] at night. It wasn't an overnight trip.
[57:12] It had taken 2 years for them to get
[57:15] there. A 2year journey
[57:19] &gt;&gt; through the desert and the swamps and
[57:20] the valleys and the mountains. But for
[57:23] two years, they come with this dirting
[57:25] desire to worship him.
[57:28] to find him, to have communion with him,
[57:31] to see him. Amen.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; You see, the journey itself expressed
[57:36] the hunger to find him.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; They didn't go two days and well, it's
[57:43] just too far. Let's just go back. No,
[57:45] two years.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. If we come to church with that
[57:48] kind of attitude, what kind of service
[57:50] would we have?
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The journey itself expressed the
[57:58] hunger to find him. They were committed.
[58:01] They came searching. Tell us where he
[58:03] is. We've got to find him. We're
[58:05] thirsting to find him. They were wanting
[58:08] him. Blessed are they do hunger and
[58:11] thirst for righteousness, for they shall
[58:14] be filled.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[58:18] &gt;&gt; But notice as they entered Jerusalem,
[58:23] you see a an intellectual thinking would
[58:26] would say, "Well, it's got to be
[58:28] Jerusalem. That's got to be where it's
[58:30] at." So when they got to Jerusalem, the
[58:34] star that was leading them went out.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Why did the star go out?
[58:43] &gt;&gt; What kind of star was it?
[58:46] Yeah.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; The star that was leading him, it went
[58:50] out.
[58:52] Why? When they got to Jerusalem, because
[58:55] the star wasn't leading them to
[58:57] Jerusalem,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; it was leading them to Bethlehem.
[59:03] Oh, I'm so glad that the star I'm
[59:05] following is not leading me to a creed
[59:07] or a denomination.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it's leading me to the
[59:11] house of God's bread. Amen. Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. It wasn't
[59:21] leading him to Jerusalem. It was leading
[59:23] him to Bethlehem. Bethlehem is the house
[59:25] of God's bread. Then how could he be
[59:28] born to Jerusalem?
[59:30] How could he be born in Ramoth Galilee?
[59:32] See,
[59:34] he had to come to where his name was.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that if he was to come in this
[59:43] day,
[59:45] &gt;&gt; would not he have to come again
[59:48] &gt;&gt; to where his name?
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Was
[59:53] &gt;&gt; I no longer call you church.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; I call you mistress Jesus Christ.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Better make a Baptist shout.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] He come to where his name was, the house
[1:00:09] of God's bread.
[1:00:11] Jerusalem could have never satisfied
[1:00:13] that thirst. That thirst to find him
[1:00:16] could never be satisfied in Jerusalem.
[1:00:18] Why? He wasn't there. Why spend time
[1:00:22] searching where he ain't? Just look for
[1:00:24] where he's at. Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; God doesn't dwell in the fanatics of the
[1:00:30] world. And down through the city they
[1:00:31] went, these wealthy men on these camels,
[1:00:34] but just they was just upset in the
[1:00:36] whole city, hollering, where is he?
[1:00:38] Where is he? Born king of the Jews.
[1:00:41] Their emotions stirred the city up and
[1:00:43] down. They went searching for him.
[1:00:48] See that they could find him on
[1:00:49] Hallelujah Avenue, but he wasn't there.
[1:00:53] They went over to the signs in Wonders
[1:00:54] Boulevard.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; But he wasn't there.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; They tried every street, but he wasn't
[1:01:02] there. Because you see, you do not know
[1:01:05] Christ by hallelujah.
[1:01:08] That's right.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; You do not know Christ by dancing in the
[1:01:11] spirit.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; You can dance in the spirit and not know
[1:01:16] him. You can know the Bible and forwards
[1:01:18] and backwards and not know him.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; True communion is not quoting the Bible.
[1:01:24] True communion is not running the aisle,
[1:01:25] but I enjoy to doing it when I feel like
[1:01:27] doing it.
[1:01:30] But what is true communion? It's you and
[1:01:32] Christ becoming one.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] Amen. You know Christ by knowing him in
[1:01:40] the person of the Holy Ghost took away
[1:01:43] your sins and planted an undying faith
[1:01:46] in a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:01:48] That's the only way you can know him as
[1:01:50] a person. What is the new birth, brother
[1:01:52] Brandham? It's it's Christ revealed to
[1:01:54] you personally.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; You have met this person.
[1:01:59] [clears throat]
[1:02:04] You see,
[1:02:06] if you're thirsting for him, like the
[1:02:09] deer that painted after that of the
[1:02:10] waterbrook,
[1:02:12] like David was, like a shepherd hunting
[1:02:15] for a lamb, like a magi following a
[1:02:18] star, if you're thirsting for him, you
[1:02:22] will find him.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] For Jesus Christ is here in this
[1:02:29] building tonight
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; where two or three are gathered in my
[1:02:33] name. I will be in their midst.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; A little while the world sees me no
[1:02:38] more, but ye shall see me. I will be
[1:02:41] with you even in you.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; That he's here tonight in his power.
[1:02:48] All his power to heal every person in
[1:02:50] this building. Every person in this
[1:02:52] building tonight can be healed.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:58] Why? He's here. His power is here. If
[1:03:01] you're looking for him, you'll find him.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; There's a fountain open tonight,
[1:03:06] brother.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Man, hungers and thirst for God. There's
[1:03:08] bound to be something in there to create
[1:03:12] that thirst.
[1:03:16] If you don't get to the waterbrook,
[1:03:20] thirsting after God, I've got to find
[1:03:22] him. I've got to commune with him. I got
[1:03:26] to talk it over with you.
[1:03:28] That fellowship,
[1:03:30] [panting and sighs]
[1:03:31] there's something about that fellowship.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; When you're in your car and all of a
[1:03:38] sudden he comes in it. When you're in
[1:03:40] your prayer closet and all of a sudden
[1:03:41] he comes in it.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about tonight.
[1:03:44] When all of a sudden you know [laughter]
[1:03:46] he's here. Amen.
[1:03:49] [panting]
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; If there's a thirst in your heart,
[1:03:56] it shows there's a touch of God
[1:03:58] somewhere
[1:04:00] that mankind can find,
[1:04:02] [sighs and gasps]
[1:04:03] there's a fountain filled with blood
[1:04:05] drawn from Emanuel's veins where sinners
[1:04:06] plunge beneath that flood and lose all
[1:04:10] their guilty states.
[1:04:13] If you're hungry for more of God, that's
[1:04:15] the evidence. There's more of God for
[1:04:16] you to be to receive. If you're striving
[1:04:19] for a revelation that proves there's
[1:04:20] more revelation of God.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet said we'd be
[1:04:25] learning of him throughout the
[1:04:26] millennium. It's an unfolding.
[1:04:28] Hallelujah.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Never put a period behind your
[1:04:32] experience. Always put a comma. I
[1:04:34] believe God in this and anything else
[1:04:36] that he by his grace would reveal to me.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; [gasps]
[1:04:42] [panting]
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; God made man with the thirst. That's a
[1:04:46] part of the human being. It's his
[1:04:47] thirst.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; I went up to the hospital to see brother
[1:04:55] Lynn this morning. We was talk trying to
[1:04:58] talk to him and bless his heart. And his
[1:05:02] speech is real slurred. And
[1:05:05] so we had prayer with him and I was
[1:05:06] getting ready, me and brother Scotty Bab
[1:05:07] was there and I was getting ready to
[1:05:08] leave and he started doing his mouth
[1:05:11] like this. He was going sweet.
[1:05:18] And Diane, which is his daughter-in-law,
[1:05:22] she said, "I think he's wanting
[1:05:23] something sweet. He loves sweet stuff."
[1:05:26] And she said, "Sylvia's coming after a
[1:05:27] while. Lyn, she's going to bring you
[1:05:29] something sweet."
[1:05:32] And I said, "Well, really, I got to
[1:05:33] preach. I got to go." And he he just
[1:05:35] grabbed a hold of me and he was just
[1:05:36] frantically grabbing a hold of my arm in
[1:05:38] my hand. And he was going, "Sweet,
[1:05:42] sweet."
[1:05:44] Oh, the Lord help me understand what he
[1:05:46] what it is he's wanting cuz he was
[1:05:49] longing. He was thirsting for something.
[1:05:54] And I said, "Sw, is he saying swig?" I
[1:05:58] said, "Relin, do you want some water?"
[1:06:02] He said yes. [panting]
[1:06:05] And we got him some water and he drank
[1:06:07] the water and that water satisfied that
[1:06:10] thirst
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; that even though he was trying his best
[1:06:13] to express what he was needing
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; cuz he was hungering for water.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:23] [panting]
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; God made man to thirst.
[1:06:27] He put a thirst in man to thirst for
[1:06:28] God. And the devil's perverted it and
[1:06:30] make you thirst for his kingdom and for
[1:06:32] the world. But the thirst in man is
[1:06:34] godly. For God made man to thirst. God
[1:06:37] made man to thirst for God. So it is
[1:06:41] they that cry of hunger hearts today.
[1:06:45] Where is that Jesus? That's the same
[1:06:47] yesterday, today, and forever. We have
[1:06:48] felt his spirit on us
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; and we've come to worship him.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And I say to you and I tonight, we have
[1:06:55] found him.
[1:06:57] in whom our hearts have thirsted for.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; But we didn't find him in a manger. We
[1:07:04] didn't find him in a creed. We didn't
[1:07:05] find him in a dogma. But we found him in
[1:07:08] a message that has led us to the
[1:07:11] revelation of where he is in our day. We
[1:07:14] have found him in whom our hearts have
[1:07:16] thirsted for.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; But don't miss this. This is the point I
[1:07:23] want to bring you tonight. this hunger,
[1:07:25] this thirst that's in your soul.
[1:07:28] But I want you to understand in reality,
[1:07:32] it wasn't you who found God.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. It wasn't you, brother. I
[1:07:38] hunger. I thirst. I longed. But it
[1:07:41] wasn't you who found him.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; It was God
[1:07:49] who found us. Amen.
[1:07:53] Hallelujah. That longing that we felt it
[1:07:57] [laughter]
[1:07:58] [panting]
[1:07:58] it was God looking for us.
[1:08:09] [panting and gasps]
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; What made those shepherds seek out after
[1:08:13] Jesus to find where the word was made
[1:08:16] flesh? What caused them to do that? It
[1:08:19] was the angel's message.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You see, if there had been no angel
[1:08:25] appearing before the shepherds, they
[1:08:27] would have not known where to go.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; But this angel said unto them, "We bring
[1:08:34] you great good tidings of great joy. For
[1:08:37] in this day, born in the city of David
[1:08:39] is a savior, and you shall be a sign to
[1:08:41] you. You shall find this babe wrapped in
[1:08:44] swaddlecloth, lied in a manger."
[1:08:47] The angels told him exactly where he
[1:08:50] was.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; What made those J magi take off on a
[1:08:55] two-year journey? The appearing of the
[1:08:58] star.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; If there had been no star, they would
[1:09:02] have never found the Christ.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; They were studying, watching for that
[1:09:06] star. What created that thirst in the
[1:09:09] shepherds? What created that longing,
[1:09:13] that hunger in the Magi's heart? What
[1:09:17] made that? It was God wanting to be
[1:09:21] found.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; We didn't find him. He found us. God was
[1:09:29] drawing us to himself.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Notice that's God's desire. God's desire
[1:09:35] is not just to be with his people.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] He wants to be in his people.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; You see, that's true communion.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; That's true fellowship. Two fellas in
[1:09:48] the same ship.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; What agreement hath the temple of God
[1:09:53] with idols. For you are the temple of
[1:09:54] the living God. As God has said, I will
[1:09:56] dwell in them and walk in them and I
[1:09:58] will be their people and they shall be I
[1:10:02] will be their God and they shall be my
[1:10:04] people. Notice where he said, "I will
[1:10:07] not dwell with them, but I will dwell in
[1:10:09] them. And I will not walk with them, but
[1:10:12] I will walk in them."
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; True communion. You see, God is a lover.
[1:10:20] God is love.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; And God so loved the world that when
[1:10:25] they were unlovable that he gave his son
[1:10:28] to make them lovable.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; And here it is. God wants to come down
[1:10:33] and make love to you. He's seeking,
[1:10:36] thirsting, hungering. God is seeking,
[1:10:40] thirsting, hungering, trying to get some
[1:10:43] of your starchy hearts
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; to make love to you
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; as a love affair. Not a law will I have
[1:10:50] to do it. No, no, no. It's not a law.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; It's love.
[1:10:57] Nobody has to make me worship God.
[1:10:59] Nobody has to make me. It's not at all.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I worship him because I love him.
[1:11:04] I pray because I love him. I seek out
[1:11:07] his fellowship because I want to be
[1:11:09] where he is.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; I just want to be where you are.
[1:11:15] [panting]
[1:11:15] [gasps]
[1:11:17] Amen. [laughter]
[1:11:19] A love affair, not a law of love. It's
[1:11:21] all in love.
[1:11:23] Who weward man or woman sitting here? If
[1:11:25] there's something in you telling you
[1:11:27] this is right,
[1:11:29] it's the Holy Spirit seeking
[1:11:33] you out.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Glor.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; If something is here telling you this
[1:11:39] message is right,
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; it's the Holy Spirit seeking you out.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Then what spirit would try to get you to
[1:11:49] pull away from it?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit seeking you out,
[1:12:00] trying to bring you to a knowledge of
[1:12:01] truth of this hour that we're now
[1:12:04] living. Not not some other hour that's
[1:12:07] done gone by. He didn't come to reveal
[1:12:09] to us Luther's day. That's done been
[1:12:10] done. But this is our day, our hour, thy
[1:12:13] time. Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:16] [panting]
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; He's calling to you for the hour is now.
[1:12:21] You see, we wasn't looking for Elijah. I
[1:12:24] wasn't looking for Elijah. Was you
[1:12:26] looking for Eli? I wasn't looking for
[1:12:27] him, Brother JD.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; But God sent Elijah looking for me.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. [panting]
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the west.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; The seventh star. Hallelujah. We have
[1:12:43] seen that seventh star. And where is it
[1:12:46] leading us? It's leading us back east
[1:12:50] to the restoration of the brritory. It's
[1:12:52] leading us back to where you find the
[1:12:55] word is made flesh again. Where is that
[1:12:58] word made flesh in this hour? It is made
[1:13:00] flesh in you.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; How many Christians here we see you
[1:13:09] raise your hand. If you're a Christian,
[1:13:11] raise your hand. He said you're not a
[1:13:12] Christian by your desire.
[1:13:15] [clears throat] You're a Christian by
[1:13:17] God's
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; desire.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; You never did seek God. At any time, it
[1:13:25] was God seeking you.
[1:13:28] [panting]
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; David said, "I hunger. I thirst like a
[1:13:34] deer trying to find water." Why was he
[1:13:37] saying that? He was God
[1:13:40] seeking out David. [gasps]
[1:13:42] [panting]
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; No man at any time has ever sought God.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; God sought man. He was elected by God
[1:13:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; to be a Christian.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Oh God. [panting]
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; I was not put here to fail.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; I was not put to be a denomination.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Come on somebody. I wasn't put here to
[1:14:10] be a drunk. I was elected by God before
[1:14:13] the foundation of the world to be here
[1:14:16] in this hour. Amen. That I could be a
[1:14:18] tabernacle. That I could be a house.
[1:14:20] That God could come down and express
[1:14:22] himself in his fullness in this hour.
[1:14:25] For every mystery of God has been made
[1:14:28] known. Why has the mysteries been made
[1:14:30] known? Because there is a people on the
[1:14:32] earth who can receive them. For they
[1:14:34] know what he wants done with his word.
[1:14:36] Thou have thus sayeth the Lord. Or keep
[1:14:39] him still.
[1:14:41] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, [applause]
[1:14:43] Lord.
[1:14:45] Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:50] [sighs and gasps]
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; No man,
[1:14:53] no man can come to me. Jesus said, "No
[1:14:56] man can come to me except
[1:15:00] my father draws him first."
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the very strain from the
[1:15:09] Garden of Eden, instead of the fallen
[1:15:12] sinner trying to find God.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; It was God who came through the garden
[1:15:18] crying, "Adam,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Adam,
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; where are you, son? [panting]
[1:15:25] It's evening time. I want to have
[1:15:27] communion. I want to have communion.
[1:15:31] Where are you?
[1:15:34] [panting]
[1:15:35] Where are you?
[1:15:37] I was in an old building down in
[1:15:39] Jumpsburg 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon,
[1:15:42] December the 21st, 1981.
[1:15:47] I've been out drinking the night before.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; But he came into the room, Brother Dy,
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; I knew it was him cuz I felt him when I
[1:15:58] was a boy. I knew it was him. [laughter]
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; He found me in an old building.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Where did he find you?
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Where
[1:16:14] are you standing here tonight? Because
[1:16:16] he found you.
[1:16:19] [panting]
[1:16:23] [snorts]
[1:16:26] sinner and he has been ever since.
[1:16:32] Who looked out? Who searched out? Who
[1:16:35] sought out the first lost son?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; God did.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Then who seeks out every lost
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; son and daughter?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; God does.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:16:53] If any man will open, I will come into
[1:16:56] him and I will suck with him. I'll
[1:17:00] commune, have fellowship with him. God
[1:17:02] wants fellowship. That's what God's
[1:17:04] heart longs for tonight. He longs for
[1:17:08] it. He longs for it. When Jesus was
[1:17:12] here, he had no coat. But he never asked
[1:17:16] the father for a coat. He walked
[1:17:20] everywhere he went. All kinds of people
[1:17:22] come by him in chariots, but he never
[1:17:25] asked God for a vehicle.
[1:17:31] He had no place to lay his head.
[1:17:34] The birds have nests. The foxes have
[1:17:36] burrows. But I, the son of man, hath no
[1:17:38] place to lay my head. But he never
[1:17:41] [laughter] asked the father for a home.
[1:17:45] The only thing he ever asked the father
[1:17:49] for
[1:17:51] was her fellowship.
[1:17:54] True communion to bring God and man
[1:17:57] together to make them one. He wants
[1:18:02] that. That's God's desire tonight above
[1:18:06] everything is to have his church
[1:18:10] [panting]
[1:18:11] one
[1:18:13] with him. That's right.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; More than a wafer.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; More than a piece of bread,
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; more than a cup of wine,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; but a true fellowship.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "I love you, Papa." He
[1:18:29] says, "I love you, Rob. [gasps]
[1:18:33] [sighs and panting]
[1:18:35] How do I know that he loves me?" Because
[1:18:38] he reveals himself to me. Yeah.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; So I could understand him.
[1:18:45] [sighs]
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him tonight?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; It's God's desire above everything is to
[1:18:53] have this church
[1:18:56] one
[1:18:58] with him.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; It makes you wonder how Enoch really
[1:19:05] walked with God.
[1:19:08] But he said Enoch walked with God and he
[1:19:10] was not because God took him because he
[1:19:14] had this testimony before his trampure
[1:19:17] before his translation that he pleased
[1:19:21] God.
[1:19:24] Oh my.
[1:19:26] Do you love him tonight?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Real hurry.
[1:19:32] guys come
[1:19:36] try to cut it a little short tonight
[1:19:38] because of communion. I wasn't sure how
[1:19:40] many would be here but
[1:19:43] just for a few more minutes I wonder
[1:19:46] can you open your heart?
[1:19:50] Can you open every door of your heart
[1:19:54] and say Lord
[1:19:56] come in
[1:19:58] just Lord not not only be my savior I
[1:20:02] don't want you just to be my savior
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; but be my lord be my ruler be my
[1:20:08] counselor take me what I am just as I am
[1:20:12] without one plea
[1:20:14] that thy blood was shed for me just as I
[1:20:18] am Lord
[1:20:19] I'll believe you.
[1:20:22] I wonder tonight before we take this
[1:20:24] communion if we could just have this
[1:20:26] moment
[1:20:28] to go before him and say, "Lord
[1:20:32] this hunger. I give it to you. Satisfy
[1:20:37] this thirst that you placed in me.
[1:20:42] Guide me, Lord. Direct me, Lord.
[1:20:46] I sacrifice my thoughts. Let the mind of
[1:20:49] Christ or let it be in me
[1:20:55] that I may have a true communion.
[1:20:59] Let that longing, that thirst, not be
[1:21:02] satisfied
[1:21:04] with just a piece of bread and a sip of
[1:21:05] wine,
[1:21:07] but with a true communion.
[1:21:10] Let our lives be filled with him.
[1:21:14] Not just in a communion service,
[1:21:17] not just in a sip of wine,
[1:21:21] but in a constant drinking.
[1:21:28] For Jesus said, "Whosoever drinkketh of
[1:21:29] this water that I shall give you,
[1:21:32] that shall give him shall never thirst,
[1:21:35] but the water that I shall give him
[1:21:36] shall be in him a well of water
[1:21:38] springing up into everlasting life.
[1:21:41] Whosoever drinks of this water, notice
[1:21:44] he didn't say just take a sip and walk
[1:21:46] away.
[1:21:47] But he said drinkkeeth. It's a
[1:21:49] continuation.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; He that drinkketh it's a keep drinking.
[1:21:57] Whosoever drinkkeeth of this water that
[1:21:58] I give give him shall never thirst
[1:22:07] because that thirsting is for him.
[1:22:10] Do you love him?
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He found me. He found you. He in
[1:22:20] whom our hearts has thirsted for
[1:22:24] has found us.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads tonight.
[1:22:37] Heavenly Father,
[1:22:41] Lord, I pray this little
[1:22:44] broke up, simple thought, Lord,
[1:22:49] pleased you, God.
[1:22:54] For Lord, it's truly my desire
[1:22:59] to hear you say,
[1:23:02] "Well done."
[1:23:06] And Lord, as I stand here tonight,
[1:23:11] I give you, Lord,
[1:23:14] my all.
[1:23:18] And Lord, sometimes I feel
[1:23:22] like that little boy's lunch.
[1:23:25] Nothing at all.
[1:23:28] But oh God, if you could use me, Lord,
[1:23:31] I give myself to you.
[1:23:35] Father, may that be the prayer of all of
[1:23:36] us tonight, Lord, as this communion
[1:23:39] service. We're so grateful to be able to
[1:23:40] to have it, Lord, on a Saturday evening.
[1:23:46] But Lord, during this time, let us just
[1:23:49] take a moment
[1:23:51] to examine our lives, Lord,
[1:23:54] to open every door, every closet, every
[1:23:57] pantry,
[1:24:00] Lord, to throw out things in our life
[1:24:02] that would hinder you from taking your
[1:24:05] full abode.
[1:24:07] And may tonight, Lord, we be willing as
[1:24:10] we pass through this communion line
[1:24:13] to lay it at your feet, Lord.
[1:24:16] And Father God, as we partake of this
[1:24:19] bread and wine, as a symbol, Lord,
[1:24:23] may the reality of your presence come
[1:24:25] into every heart, into every home, every
[1:24:28] man, woman, boy, and girl that when we
[1:24:30] go out those doors, Lord,
[1:24:34] we can be a light to a dying generation.
[1:24:40] Grant it, Lord, tonight,
[1:24:43] whoever's head's bowed, just a moment.
[1:24:44] And I wonder if you'd say, "Brother,
[1:24:45] Darl, that's truly my desire tonight. I
[1:24:48] I understand what you're trying to say.
[1:24:50] And I want that also more than anything
[1:24:52] in my life. I want more of him.
[1:24:56] More love, more mercy, more grace, more
[1:24:59] power, more surrender, more of you in my
[1:25:01] life. Lord,
[1:25:03] God bless those hands there that raised
[1:25:05] them. [snorts]
[1:25:08] Perhaps you didn't feel you needed to
[1:25:09] raise your hand. Won't you pray for that
[1:25:12] person beside you? For perhaps they did
[1:25:16] that this would be our desire tonight.
[1:25:20] Because you see, brothers and sisters,
[1:25:26] we wasn't ever looking for him,
[1:25:29] but he came looking for me. He came
[1:25:34] looking for you, Lord God. You see the
[1:25:36] hands that was raised tonight, Lord.
[1:25:39] this quiet moment of time, we simply
[1:25:42] Lord surrender everything we have to you
[1:25:46] Lord.
[1:25:47] In Jesus name we pray. You see my
[1:25:50] brother, my sister tonight, Lord, as
[1:25:52] they pass through this line, those that
[1:25:54] are afflicted, Lord, those in need, may
[1:25:56] every need be met tonight, Lord. For you
[1:25:59] have come in this service as you said
[1:26:01] you would, Lord.
[1:26:03] your desire, Lord, as a fellowship with
[1:26:04] us tonight, Lord, with thanksgiving in
[1:26:08] our heart. We say to you, Father, thank
[1:26:12] you
[1:26:14] that you came looking for us
[1:26:17] in Jesus name we pray.
[1:26:19] Amen. And amen. Do you love him tonight,
[1:26:23] friends?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Harry, sing that song for us,
[1:26:27] buddy.
[1:26:29] Let's just worship you just for a moment
[1:26:30] before we turn the service over to
[1:26:32] brother [music] Donnie.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; One night while
[1:26:37] life's raging sea it looked as [music]
[1:26:40] if I would suffer [singing]
[1:26:43] defeat. As the blackness of night
[1:26:46] [music]
[1:26:47] closed off the light, my heart sank with
[1:26:51] fear. [singing]
[1:26:54] Abundance red cry [music] rang out with
[1:26:58] fright.
[1:27:00] All I could see [music and singing] was
[1:27:02] no hope inside. With faith all but gone,
[1:27:07] I met the one who came looking for
[1:27:10] [music and singing] me.
[1:27:14] He came looking for me.
[1:27:16] [music and singing]
[1:27:19] He came looking for me. [singing]
[1:27:25] He made a way [music] when there was no
[1:27:29] way [singing] that I could see.
[1:27:33] [music]
[1:27:36] So far, Jesus was near to rescue my soul
[1:27:41] [music and singing]
[1:27:42] and calm all my fear. Now I'm safe from
[1:27:46] all harm since I met the one who came
[1:27:50] looking [singing and music] for me.
[1:27:54] He came looking for me. [singing]
[1:27:59] He came looking for me. [music]
[1:28:05] He [singing] made a way when [music]
[1:28:08] there was no way that I could see.
[1:28:13] [music]
[1:28:14] When I drifted so far, Jesus was near
[1:28:19] [singing]
[1:28:20] to rescue [music] my soul and calm all
[1:28:23] my fear. Now I'm safe from all harm.
[1:28:27] I [music] met the one who came looking
[1:28:30] for me. [singing]
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, Satan had already picked out my
[1:28:38] grave and plan and moved forward to put
[1:28:42] me away. [singing]
[1:28:44] I drifted so far. Would anyone [music]
[1:28:48] care that I soon be lost?
[1:28:54] I [music and singing] knew my
[1:28:56] destruction was a matter of time.
[1:28:59] [music] But Jesus appeared and said,
[1:29:02] "This one is mine. Now I'm [music] safe
[1:29:05] with no harm." [singing]
[1:29:07] He walked through the storm. He came
[1:29:10] looking for [music] me.
[1:29:14] He came looking for [music and singing]
[1:29:16] me. He came looking for me. He came
[1:29:20] looking for me.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; He made a way when there [singing] was
[1:29:28] no way that I could see. [music]
[1:29:34] I drifted so far. Jesus [music]
[1:29:38] was here [singing]
[1:29:39] to rescue my soul and calm all my
[1:29:43] [music] fears. Now I'm safe from all
[1:29:46] harm.
[1:29:49] He came looking [singing]
[1:29:50] for me.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; He came looking for me.
[1:29:58] He came looking for me. [music]
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he did?
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; He made a way. He
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; made a way.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; When there was [music] no way that I
[1:30:10] could see.
[1:30:13] [music]
[1:30:14] When I drifted so far, Jesus was near to
[1:30:19] rescue my [music and singing] soul and
[1:30:22] calm all my fear. Now I'm safe from all
[1:30:25] harm. I met the one who came looking
[1:30:30] [music] for me.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:38] Thank you, brother Daryl. That
[1:30:40] wonderful. Praise the Lord. [applause]
[1:30:46] God bless you. You can be seated if
[1:30:48] you'd like to read with me in U 1
[1:30:50] Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23. I was
[1:30:54] listening today to the sermon that
[1:30:56] brother Brand preached entitled
[1:30:58] communion in 1962
[1:31:01] and if you haven't listened to it in a
[1:31:02] while it do good to listen to it. He
[1:31:04] said that really what we are about to
[1:31:06] participate in here tonight is not
[1:31:08] actually communion.
[1:31:11] And he said communion is whenever you
[1:31:14] are communing back and forth.
[1:31:18] So he identified even a preacher. He
[1:31:21] said when you go to hear a preacher,
[1:31:23] you're not actually having communion
[1:31:25] with that preacher. Now what happened
[1:31:27] here tonight was that the preacher was
[1:31:29] inspired by God and gave us the words
[1:31:31] that the Lord put on his heart. But what
[1:31:33] did we do? Do we talk back to him? We
[1:31:35] sat there and said amen and nodded our
[1:31:37] head and said, "Praise the Lord." And I
[1:31:39] was blessed. but wasn't actually
[1:31:41] communing with him. And that's the way a
[1:31:43] lot of folks are when it comes to
[1:31:45] church. They go to church, but they're
[1:31:48] not actually communing with God. So,
[1:31:50] they come and fellowship with one
[1:31:52] another and fellowship with societies
[1:31:54] and this and that and the other. Um, but
[1:31:56] they're not communing with God, but we
[1:31:59] want to have true communion with him.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; So, the prophet went on to say that
[1:32:03] people get down to pray and they tell
[1:32:06] God, I want this, I want that, I need
[1:32:07] that, I want that. Amen. He said, "All
[1:32:10] you've done is just brought your needs
[1:32:11] and your list to God, your request, but
[1:32:14] you didn't give God time to talk back to
[1:32:17] you."
[1:32:19] Brother Donnie, you mean you think God
[1:32:21] would talk to me? It's not important
[1:32:22] what I think. What do you think?
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Do you think he will?
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; I believe with all of my heart. He
[1:32:31] desires to commune with us more than we
[1:32:34] even believe and realize ourselves.
[1:32:38] Let's read together. [clears throat]
[1:32:41] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:32:44] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:32:48] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:32:52] he was betrayed took bread.
[1:32:56] As I've been thinking today and praying
[1:32:58] and just pondering over these
[1:33:01] scriptures, it just so blessed my heart
[1:33:04] as I begin to realize that this is the
[1:33:07] only place in the scripture where we
[1:33:10] actually have the formula, as we would
[1:33:13] say, to know how to even take communion.
[1:33:17] And I want you to notice where Paul said
[1:33:19] he got it from.
[1:33:22] For I have received
[1:33:25] from the Lord.
[1:33:28] Anybody here going to debate that?
[1:33:32] I was hoping there was nobody that dumb.
[1:33:34] [clears throat]
[1:33:36] Oh, so you mean to tell me that
[1:33:39] one man received from the Lord the way
[1:33:43] and the order that we should have
[1:33:45] communion?
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; And millions of people have observed
[1:33:49] this down through the ages. And only one
[1:33:52] man got it from God.
[1:33:56] I figured somebody shout glory after
[1:33:58] that.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; For I have received of the Lord that
[1:34:02] which also I delivered unto you,
[1:34:06] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:34:08] which he was betrayed, took bread, and
[1:34:12] when he had given thanks, he broke it
[1:34:15] and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[1:34:19] which is broken for you. Now remember in
[1:34:22] the four gospels they wrote what Jesus
[1:34:24] done but they actually never put it
[1:34:26] together for us to tell us how to do it.
[1:34:30] But God gave it to his prophet messenger
[1:34:32] in the first age. And when he had given
[1:34:35] thanks, he break it and said, "Take,
[1:34:38] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[1:34:41] you. This do in remembrance of me."
[1:34:45] After the same manner also
[1:34:48] he took the cup and when he had sucked,
[1:34:52] saying, "This cup is the new testament
[1:34:55] in my blood. This do ye as oft as you
[1:34:59] drink it in remembrance of me. For as
[1:35:03] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:35:06] this cup, you do show the Lord's death."
[1:35:09] Now Jesus never said this. Matthew,
[1:35:12] Mark, Luke, nor John never said this.
[1:35:16] But Paul received this from the Lord
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; and it became scripture.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; This is the way God reveals his word
[1:35:28] through prophets.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophets.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; For as often as you eat this bread and
[1:35:35] drink this cup, you shu the Lord's death
[1:35:38] till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall
[1:35:40] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:35:42] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:35:46] body and the blood of the Lord. Now,
[1:35:50] this is what we're supposed to do. Well,
[1:35:52] brother Donnie, I'm waiting till I'm
[1:35:53] perfect to take communion, which means
[1:35:55] you'll never take it,
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Which means you'll never take it.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; But these are the instructions from the
[1:36:04] Lord through his messenger.
[1:36:08] Notice this.
[1:36:10] Let a man examine himself, which the
[1:36:14] word I looked at it this evening, test,
[1:36:16] try, prove, see if there's anything
[1:36:20] outstanding that you need to fix.
[1:36:24] Let a man examine himself. And then on
[1:36:27] the night they have communion, stay
[1:36:29] home.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; That's what a lot of folks do.
[1:36:35] But let a man examine himself. And so
[1:36:39] let him
[1:36:41] eat.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Oh wow. So after you examine yourself,
[1:36:45] then if there's anything that needs to
[1:36:47] be fixed, what you do? You go to the
[1:36:50] fixer.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; And then what are you supposed to do?
[1:36:54] You're supposed to eat. You see, those
[1:36:56] who eat and drink damnation to themsel
[1:36:58] are people that know they got things in
[1:36:59] their life that it's not right with the
[1:37:01] Lord, but they don't examine themsel and
[1:37:03] ask God to fix it for them. So then if
[1:37:05] they go ahead and do that, that's when
[1:37:07] they fulfill this verse. This is not
[1:37:09] talking about people who are confessing
[1:37:12] their wrongs before the Lord and asking
[1:37:14] him to fix them. Because if he didn't,
[1:37:18] nobody could take communion. Not even
[1:37:19] the preacher that preached to us
[1:37:21] tonight.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Or the preacher reading this scripture
[1:37:23] to you. So this is our part. We examine
[1:37:28] oursel. But let a man examine himself
[1:37:31] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:37:32] drink of that cup. For he eateth and
[1:37:35] drinkketh unworthily.
[1:37:38] Eatith and drinkkeeth, notice this now,
[1:37:40] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[1:37:43] Lord's body. For this cause many are
[1:37:45] weak and sickly among you, and many
[1:37:48] sleep. For if you would judge ourselves,
[1:37:53] we should not be judged.
[1:37:58] Now, we're going to bow our heads and
[1:38:00] you're praying, of course, for your
[1:38:01] brothers and sisters that are around.
[1:38:02] You heard the prophet today as he did
[1:38:05] this and he said, "Now, you're praying
[1:38:06] for them if there would be anything in
[1:38:08] their heart that they need to make right
[1:38:10] that the Lord will help them to be able
[1:38:12] to make it right." So, you pray for
[1:38:15] yourself, of course, and you're praying
[1:38:16] for your brothers and sisters as well.
[1:38:18] And remember, as I said a while ago,
[1:38:20] there's healing in the communion. I've
[1:38:24] been praying all day today, just off and
[1:38:26] on all day, that God would visit us in
[1:38:29] such a mighty way here tonight, and
[1:38:32] bring healing. So many saints are sick
[1:38:34] with different things in their body. I
[1:38:36] believe this is true, don't you? Let's
[1:38:39] just bow our heads together and we'll
[1:38:40] have have just a moment of silent prayer
[1:38:43] of deacon brothers, if they'll come.
[1:38:48] I pray for your children tonight.
[1:38:50] Father, your God, search each heart,
[1:38:52] Lord. Each person, Lord Jesus, if
[1:38:56] there's anything, dear God, that needs
[1:38:58] to be fixed, may they fix it, Lord. May
[1:39:01] they lay it right in your presence
[1:39:03] tonight, God. Search me. Search every
[1:39:06] one of us, Lord. Dear God, we come to
[1:39:09] you. May you look at us. We examine
[1:39:12] ourselves, but you're the only one, dear
[1:39:14] God, that can fix us. Help us tonight,
[1:39:17] Father. Minister to us. I pray tonight,
[1:39:20] dear God. Many of your children are sick
[1:39:23] and they need healing. Lord God, when
[1:39:25] they press this little piece of bread to
[1:39:27] their lips and this cup of wine, may the
[1:39:30] healing virtue of Jesus Christ go
[1:39:33] through their bodies. Granted, I pray
[1:39:36] Lord, Jesus name.
[1:39:53] Heavenly Father's
[1:40:02] dear God, I pray you sanctify this
[1:40:05] bread. Lord, we know that no has the
[1:40:10] power to turn it into your body,
[1:40:17] but it's a symbol to us. But Lord, it is
[1:40:21] sacred. It is precious.
[1:40:24] May every child of God that comes here
[1:40:26] tonight, Lord, may they take that
[1:40:30] sacredness in their heart this way,
[1:40:33] Father
[1:40:36] Jesus.
[1:40:50] Lord Jesus, the blood of your grace,
[1:40:53] as I lift the lids from you, dear God,
[1:40:56] the aroma begins to come up into my
[1:40:59] face. Lord, I know that it's not water.
[1:41:04] I know it's not Kool-Aid. It's not tea.
[1:41:08] But it's and to know Lord this
[1:41:14] don't get weak but it gets stronger and
[1:41:17] stronger. Lord God how grateful we are.
[1:41:21] For many of us years ago it would take
[1:41:24] to I think of myself Lord how many times
[1:41:28] I took it and I took it with a cracker
[1:41:32] and grape juice. But tonight Lord I
[1:41:35] could stand here because Because the
[1:41:37] revelation has been restored in the last
[1:41:40] days. It was bread and wine. Another
[1:41:43] truth, oh God, that was to be come back
[1:41:46] in the end time. Father, sanctify this
[1:41:49] wine, dear God, I pray. Bless your
[1:41:52] children as they partake in the name of
[1:41:54] Jesus Christ. Amen.

[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; St. John
[2:05:30] in order to bring us
[2:05:33] to himself.
[2:05:37] He had to pay the price in these
[2:05:39] elements.
[2:05:42] But the washing of the blood and the
[2:05:44] cleansing of the soul and the changing
[2:05:46] of the nature
[2:05:48] is going to make a way for him to walk
[2:05:51] in us. As brother Daryl quoted it, walk
[2:05:54] is a manner of life.
[2:05:59] Something that is automatically lived
[2:06:01] out by a nature inside of a person. So
[2:06:05] this is why God didn't want to just be
[2:06:07] with us and walk beside us. He wanted to
[2:06:11] walk in us, live his own life out of us.
[2:06:16] So now he's going to show us some of the
[2:06:18] things he would do.
[2:06:21] And supper being ended, the devil having
[2:06:23] now put into the heart of Judas's
[2:06:25] Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him.
[2:06:28] Jesus knowing that the Father had given
[2:06:30] all things into his hands, that he was
[2:06:33] come from God and went to God. He riseth
[2:06:37] from supper and laid aside his garments
[2:06:41] and took a towel and girded himself.
[2:06:46] Almighty God
[2:06:49] going to wash his disciples feet.
[2:06:53] After that he pth water into a basin and
[2:06:55] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[2:06:58] wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[2:06:59] was girded. Then cometh he to Simon
[2:07:02] Peter. And Peter saith unto him,"Lord,
[2:07:05] dust thou wash my feet?" Jesus answered
[2:07:09] and said unto him, "What I do, thou
[2:07:11] knowest not now, but thou shalt know
[2:07:13] hereafter?" Peter sth unto him, "Thou
[2:07:16] shalt never wash my feet." Jesus
[2:07:19] answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou
[2:07:22] has no part with me." Simon Peter saith
[2:07:26] unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but
[2:07:28] also my hands and my head. Jesus saith
[2:07:32] to him, he that is washed needeth not to
[2:07:35] wash his feet, but is clean every wit.
[2:07:39] And ye are clean, but not all. For he
[2:07:43] knew who should betray him. Therefore
[2:07:46] said he, you are not all clean. So after
[2:07:49] he had washed their feet and taken his
[2:07:52] garments and was set down again, he said
[2:07:56] unto them, now can you imagine sitting
[2:07:58] there 2,000 years ago? Jesus would have
[2:08:02] washed our feet, would have got his
[2:08:04] robe, put it back around him because
[2:08:06] he'd used part of that to gert himself.
[2:08:09] And he would sat down and we're sitting
[2:08:11] there looking at him and thinking, "What
[2:08:13] is he going to say? What just happened
[2:08:15] to us?" Now listen at these words.
[2:08:20] Know ye what I have done to you. For you
[2:08:24] call me Master and Lord. Notice this
[2:08:28] now. You say well for so I am. If I then
[2:08:32] your Lord and Master have washed your
[2:08:35] feet. Ye also ought to wash one
[2:08:39] another's feet. For I have given you an
[2:08:43] example, an example that you should do
[2:08:47] as I have unto done unto you. Verily,
[2:08:50] verily, I say unto you, the servant is
[2:08:52] not greater than his Lord, neither he
[2:08:54] that is sent greater than he that sent
[2:08:57] him. If you know these things, happy are
[2:09:01] ye if you do them. Brothers, remain
[2:09:06] here. Sisters, go over in the fellowship
[2:09:08] hall. And I want to um just say I know
[2:09:11] for your sisters that'll be taking your
[2:09:14] children with you. I know it's a little
[2:09:16] bit difficult for them because the
[2:09:18] fellowship hall is where they you know
[2:09:21] eat and drink and do this and that and
[2:09:23] the other. But just keep just keep
[2:09:26] reminding them that this is a sacred
[2:09:28] time. So it's not a time to eat and
[2:09:30] fellowship and things. So just help each
[2:09:32] other out if you need to just to watch
[2:09:34] one another. We want it to be sacred. I
[2:09:37] felt I've felt a
[2:09:41] just an awesome presence of the Lord
[2:09:43] around me all day today. A sacredness, a
[2:09:47] special something. I believe he wants us
[2:09:50] to keep it in reverence and honor. Don't
[2:09:53] you? God bless you. Your sister as you
[2:09:56] go there. God be with you. Brothers, you
[2:09:59] can gather here around the front.
