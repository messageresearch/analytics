that's when you've really got a praise that's worth testifying about god bless you be gracious tonight in the name of the lord certainly welcome each of you that are here in the visible audience and those that are streaming all the streamers we want to welcome them as well you know we have several that still have not felt comfortable in coming back to church because of all the stuff that's going on we certainly understand that i want to remember all them and prayer that god would just be with them and we miss them don't we i miss them when they're not here you may not be here but you're not you're not forgotten we love you and we want you to know that let's turn tonight again if you would in second timothy chapter 3 verse 1. before we read there louis said brett gilbert had had a request that he wanted us to pray about tonight also like you to remember brother jack and sister betty roberts i talked about jack just fought came out a little bit ago and sister betty got to come home monday night and um they're both doing doing pretty good uh with the coveting they're still not over it yet but we thank the lord for for the improvement that they've had i'm still likely to remember my daughter alicia if you would she's feeling better the lord touched her here sunday whenever in service and we certainly appreciate that but still needs a touch from the lord and like you remember erica also erica's doing well thank the lord we so appreciate that had four treatments got a fifth one coming up a week after thanksgiving which is monday tuesday and wednesday and uh she still gets tired and things but we're so grateful so many of the symptoms that normally accompany the chemotherapy and all that the lord has been so gracious to her and we certainly appreciate it how many's got so much to thank him for you know what i told carol yesterday and today was talking about it you know we can spend all of our time just being so sad and so down we got a lot to affect us we should don't we that's right we do or we can spend that time being grateful that all the things that he does for us through the midst of all these difficulties it's your path you choose which way you want to go you can praise your way out of it or feel sorry for yourself and have the mully grubs and just be mad and aggravated everybody else that don't help you or nobody else either the only person that helps is the devil and i'm going to do everything i can to hurt that rascal not helping don't you amen god bless you let's let's read together and then we'll pray over the word tonight also i wanted you to to remember brother randy and gessenden he'll be getting some treatments in about two weeks they were able surgically to remove all the cancer that was in brother randy's body but part of it they could not remove so um they were going to have to begin chemo in two weeks and i asked him if it was okay if i mentioned it to you all and i said most certainly wanted you all to know about it and to be praying for him so we'll certainly be remembering our brother that the lord will just be with him and my sister sharon as well well let's read about the times that we're in ii timothy 3 1. this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come and anybody in here with me tonight say it's here it's here for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection wow these are your neighbors some of your family some of your friends some of the people you work with i hope it ain't known you all without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god and notice the last verse is the clincher of all this they're not infidels and agnostics and they're not communist in reality they're not even socialist but they're having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away my mind think of it you're living in this very time frame and god by his grace has rescued you has rescued me has rescued all of those that believe from being these people because in reality a lot of us fulfill these verses you know there might be certain ones you didn't do but when you look at it i had a whole lot against me and so did you thank god for his grace can we pray together heavenly father we bow our heads to the dust of the earth and we know lord jesus that through the breath of life you have breathed into this dust body eternal life and we are so thankful but we know that the body itself never caught that breast but it was the soul and we know if time would tarry and you lord would delay your coming before too many years father some that's standing here lord another generation will be no doubt the preachers and the deacons and the trustees and the musicians and time will roll on so father we ask that while we are here and we have an opportunity help us to serve you with everything that we have our strengths our might our mental capacity everything that we are and mainly our soul that's in love with you father these needs and requests that we've mentioned to you tonight god no doubt there's many many others i pray that you'd be mindful of us lord we thank you for through all the things that we go through your grace is sufficient we love you with all of our hearts open our understanding tonight father to your word in the name of the lord jesus we ask it amen god bless you saints you may be seated thank you i find this an amazing verse that paul would start to address such traits and characteristics of the last days and he would use these opening words this no also we know that also as in the english language it is a word that is added to something else that has already been seen heard or said of course you read chapter 1 and chapter 2 of second timothy of the things that paul has already addressed but he felt the need to also include this needless to say it's not something that would make us very happy the contents of these five verses are not something that is uplift uplifting to us doesn't make us feel like shouting doesn't make us feel like rejoicing but yet it's a part of prophecy and sometimes prophecy has this side now it uses these words this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come the terms last days are actually words that were brought over from the old testament it was used first of all in the book of genesis whenever the prophet said come you sons of jacob and i will tell you what will befall you in the last days also used in the book of isaiah also used in the book of daniel so we know that it is a term that is used to be able to frame something that would fit in a certain time frame now actually whenever paul is writing this the last days is already in motion because the term last days is inclusive from the first century until the time of the rapture or the going away of the bride so it's during this interim period that this term last days is going to be so it's not the last 25 days before the rapture it's not the last 10 days but it's inclusive now prophetic language can be kind of strange now we would think well why didn't he just say the last 2000 years but you see days is a term that god anointed his prophets to use when it would be something that would be a symbol that it would actually symbolize a period of time so instead of saying two thousand years it would say the last days the last two days two days which fell in succession so god's way of saying things sometimes is very difficult to us and we think well by reading the bible that we just read it the way we'd pick up a newspaper and read it that way but we'll miss so much if we do so paul knew that the last days had already begun john turned it and said that you've heard that the last times or the latter days or the last part of the sequence of time would come to pass and he said that the antichrist would be revealed and he said it's already here so the succession of the last days has been going on since the first century actually from the time that the lord jesus began to speak of the prophetic hunters from john the baptist actually when john the baptist come and spoke what he done john never spoke so much of what would come after the lord jesus but it was the beginning of the dispensation was with the son of man and when the son of man the lord jesus began to utter the prophetic things that actually started the sequence of what is known as the last days now in that there would be times that the last days would catapult to reach such heights of the prophecies and there would be times that it would go down and it would ease up a little bit we know that the bible tells us in the book of acts that the churches had rest so it was as if god would force satan to back off the pressure that was against the churches and they would have a little a little bit of reprieve away from that time we know that it would coincide with the roman emperors that caligula and different ones would come through and they would actually buy they would cause such difficulty on the church and then you would have ones and it would have seemingly a change of heart they would still be a roman emperor they were still as heathen as they could be but god would move on their hearts and give the churches a little bit of reprieve then of course we know it come at the time of constantine that when it come there 300 325 all of that the constantine actually was the beginning of the roman church as we know today but in that time the church had several decades of time by which they were given a great reprieve and there was not any tribulation and that seemed to be a great thing but yet god knew exactly that was the beginning of the end now what was the beginning of a reprieve of the time of tribulation because he put an end to the christians being crucified he put him in uh to where that they would no longer burn them as torches as they did in the days of the preceding emperors and it looked like a great thing but yet little did many of them know that by marrying the church into rome and setting christianity as the state religion then they would turn eventually from the roman empire into the roman catholic church then they would take that power and they would begin the inquisition they would begin the inquisitions of time of course the spanish inquisition and then the roman inquisition and the time that they would burn them and it would turn from the roman political power until the roman church power now for many many hundreds of years we've been living in a cycle by which the roman power has no longer been doing the inquisition but we know according to prophecy that the power will return again now we also know that america was seen in the prophet john's vision as he was on the isle of patmos and revelation chapter 13. and we know that in that in the book of revelation that the symbols of land and of water and of beasts and many of these things were used to symbolize powers and we know that whenever john saw a beast that would rise up out of water that it meant this beast power was coming forth out of thickness and multitudes of people but when john saw this peculiar looking animal and this animal raised up and it began to speak like a lamb now it was not like the ox or it was not like the bullock it was not like the beast of revelation 17 but it was an animal or a power that raised up out of the land and there was not many people there now actually that power john saw a buffalo now the buffalo it had horns like a lamb which of course the buffalo's horns are really short it must have been very unusual to john and by naturally speaking it john had never more than likely ever seen a buffalo in his life but yet god was raising up this power that would be able to express and it did not come out of thickness and multitudes of people because the cherokee the arapaho the blackfoot the lakota all the different ones were scattered across this nation so john saw this power coming up out of a place where there was not many people there and it had two horns in the representation of civil and ecclesiastical power but when it first started out it started speaking as a lamb now this was the birth of our nation america and this is when the europeans come and they took it away from the original owners of it and that was the native americans and yet whenever it was founded the symbolism of its power was two horns not seven like john saw and there was not one that broke off the side and then had an eye which was antiochus epiphanes in the old testament but just two horns and notice there was no eyes in the horn so it was a symbol of a great power that would raise up now this is our nation and this is why i do not believe that our nation will ever turn toward communism i do not believe that as a whole our nation will ever turn solidly toward socialism if you'll remember the vision the prophet saw that he saw socialism and communism and all that merging together into communism and whenever he heard the voice say you know that it was to what watch russia watch communism not socialism now we've got socialists in our government we know that i mean know that there is a socialist power that's trying to raise up in america but don't you never fear that because it will be the power of catholicism that will raise under the civil and the ecclesiastical power that will actually lead this now you'll notice when the prophet saw this vision the prophet john he saw it maintaining in the stage of its use he never saw this nation actually turning into a ram but it was he said as a land so it was as a lamb so what did it signify it signified that this nation would raise in great power but it would never become an old nation like the european nations have done it would never become an old nation like babylon like syria like israel but it maintained its use and actually it would have been killed in its use now i'm sorry you didn't know i just quoted to you a direct quote from the message so notice this whenever john saw this then whenever brother branham turns and sees the same thing and he says that it was actually the nation itself never got hundreds and hundreds and thousands of years old as you know sicily and italy and many of those places but it still remains the identity of its youth so our nation itself grace a great part in the last days of prophecy and that those civil and ecclesiastical powers will come together and the prophet tells us over and over again that it will be through an election now he's not talking about the election of grace but he's talking about the american vote and that it would be through an election that they would put this power in and whenever it does this power makes a transition now it jumps from being as a lamb it starts out freedom of religion we the people we the people all the people has the rights to do this and do that and something else but at the right time it will change and the voice will go from the voice of the lamb and it will speak with the power of the dragon and it will speak as the dragon that was before it now friend you believe whatever you want to believe i believe that we are on the very fringe of that prophecy when the voice will change now will it come through and as a side and aspect of socialism you know you hear so much about the reset the reset they're wanting to reset our government and you know you look and you realize that through the covet thing already that people's rights have already been friends support and it looks like they're fixing to do it again and the governor of new york today you know yesterday had made a comment that a lot of the spread of it in their in their area was doing was to be laid on churches and on synagogues so now think of it if that same thing moves down into tennessee and ohio and all these other places well you churches keep me because you all are the ones that's doing it is it amazing all these people can get out and protest and do this and that and the other and none of them code the germs follow protesters okay well all right if that's the way you want to play ball i'll play with you then sunday morning we're having a devil protest we're having a sin protest so apparently if covet don't follow protests we're no longer just going to have church services alone but we're going to turn them into protest meetings and we'll protest abortion and we'll protest homosexuality and we'll protest drinking and lying and adultery and fornication well praise the lord if black lives matter can protest and none of them gets covered our true surely we can protest people killing babies well hallelujah isn't it amazing how that it turns when the shoe goes on the other foot people don't like that do they but you see our nation now will this happen before the bride is gone i do not know i do know there is a thus saith the lord from the prophet of god that he said it this way we will be facing a religious persecution it will come now will the bride see that i don't know will the bride enter into the initial stages of it i do not know all i know is i want to be ready every day of my life and if we do then god will give us strength to face it and there ain't no even worrying and threatening about it anyway because if we are your worry won't help you your faith will help you more than your worry will so we can see from the setting here in ii timothy that there are many many aspects of this prophetic word that must all come together at the right time now no matter how much the people of america and you know this is has probably been in the in the making for many many years of those who would like to destroy our democracy and they would like to take away the white the rights of the church and all of that but they could not do it until there was a release now we know that even the lord jesus even though he was light he could not come out of the grave and his body could not come back to life until his soul lined up with the prophetic word that within three days he would rise from the dead so that word kept him back from entering into his body there's no other reason why he did not just leave his body go down into hell empty out paradise and be gone the next morning well why didn't he do it there was a word that kept him from doing it right so the resurrection could not happen until the right time the rapture cannot happen till the right time the people who are finally going to lead our nation to total destruction cannot do it till the right time the right man cannot be the president or woman could not be the president i don't care how many they tried and what they tried to do it cannot happen until god's prophetic word lines up there's nothing you and i can do to make it happen and there's nothing we can do to stop it from happening now these are things that god sovereignly controls on his own it does not even depend on our faithfulness to it it does not depend upon how much we pray about it it regard many of these things god does and his own sovereign will and i am so glad because man would totally mess it up but notice paul mentions 19 different things conditions that would exist now i'm sure that no more than likely many of these things existed in the time when paul was writing this but it was a great decline that he's going to speak about it was times of a great rampage and great fierceness that was going on in society so it was not just in the church but it was as his term a societal uh degeneration and of falling apart of society of homeland of politics of religion so it's going to be a falling apart and these will be the observable 19 characteristics that the believers will be able to look at now really only the believers will have the true insight many people can read this bible and say oh yeah yeah that's around that sure they're there but the believers been baptized by the holy ghost they have an insight that even just a bible reader would not see now the word that he uses as he introduces this is the word perilous and it means violent and fierce wild difficult grievous hard to bear and distressing so these will be perilous time anybody find them so in that day that day as it is in this day as it has been before but remember as we get closer to the consummation of time then these things will definitely get worse because it's like there's more demons that are released out of hell i personally don't understand how that works but i do know that with the opening of the seals there came a great change in the world of demons when the lord jesus came to the earth there was more physical manifestation and you hear the demon's voices crying out of people more in those three and a half years of his ministry than you did in the entire canon of scripture in the old testament which covered a span of hundreds and hundreds of years and got in that little short span of his life but here was all heaven on the earth and when all heaven when god was shown on the earth speaking it was as if though that on the reciprocating side of darkness that god allowed the darkness to speak out in demonology in a way that it had never done before so if the opening of the seals and the revealing of the son of man has brought to us the great presence of the pillar of fire then we pretty well ought to know that in this junction there will be darkness like never before and there will be such an onslaught against the body look friends i'm in contact with people all over the world and i hear from different parts of the world just about every day and you know being friends with many many people and it's absolutely amazing in the last six months what has happened not just in happy valley not just in the united states but all over the world the things that have happened and it seems like that the people of god are under such an attack like we have never seen it before but yet at the same time i would rather live right now than any time that has ever been in history to me my life is greater now than it has ever been before now i'm not talking about materially and finally i'm not talking about that i'm talking about my own walk with god and where the word is right now with so much going on i'll tell you i was sitting downstairs studying the other night and the lord just opened up some things to me i had to lay my laptop down and get up and just move about a little bit i thought i'm going to bust wide open right here on this couch and carol's going to come down here and find bits and pieces scattered everywhere i'm going to have to take a break and you think right in the middle of hell right in the middle of such burdens i mean that's what i'm talking about you've got burdens you've got stress you've got things you're dealing with that you've never dealt with in your life and look at the word look at what god is saying to us out of his word does not god concern himself with covenant us is god not concerned with the things his people are going through yes but to me what's god doing he's getting above the nest and he's flopping his wings and saying look how great i am look how big i am look how marvelous my word is don't just get your eyes on the trouble and on the sickness and on the heartaches and on the disease but get your eyes on me oh my god notice paul said that it would be perilous times i found in studying this that he used the same word that the lord jesus used in matthew 8 28 to describe the condition of the demonic man in the gatherings notice this matthew 8 28 and when he was come to the other side into the country of the genesis there met him too possessed with devils coming out of the tomb exceeding fierce now look at this word even though it's you know you wouldn't think it the word fierce is perilous hard to do hard to take to approach hard to bear troublesome dangerous harsh fierce savage now here is this man and the description that the officer matthew chose to write of a demon-possessed man was that this man was fierce but it wasn't just that he was had a display of anger but he was hard to deal with nobody knew how to handle him nobody knew what to do with him and yet the bible goes on to tell us so that no man might pass by that way so here we have a prophecy setting forth to us that people will be so under the power of demons in the last day they will believe doctrines of devils they will be under the influence of devils in their homes the influence of devils by the music they listen to if you don't believe that all you got to do is go in lowe's and walmart anywhere you go and all restaurants anymore they play rock and roll you can't even hardly sit there and eat right and then you think how in the world can people live with such stuff and yet we know it's preparing them for the tribulation period so they will be what what will the world become now this is not just america of course but the world will become a demonic graveyard to where people are so under the influence of these demon spirits that they will be fierce and it will be for the righteous that we will not want to be around where they are as it was the man the maniac of gadara that whenever he was there that the people would go around him they would walk way around to bypass where the man was because you never knew what he would say you never knew what he would do he would come up and chomp on people and scare people and chase people and you know as well as i do that if you and i saw anybody like that physically most of us are going to run from them are they not and yet many of the ones that we deal with today they're not chained with natural chains but friends they're chained in their souls they are souls that are in prison now they're so shrouded in darkness that's all they think about they think about filth they sing about filth their songs are filled with adultery and fornication they're filled with all kind well i wish somebody would preach with me tonight their songs are filled with all kinds of stuff and their movies that they watch are filled with one thing after another the books are filled with that the websites that they visit are filled with it well praise god that's the truth and yet it's so sad and you and i what do we want to do we're finally oh you think you're homesick now wait for a little more just wait for a little while longer when the demonic expression reaches so high that even you'll feel your very life is threatened by these demons remember it's not many of these people but it's the spirit in them that recognizes the spirit of god in you and it hates you notice then paul said in verse 2 whenever he lays it out that it will be the last days and then it will be in this this type of fierce perilous time he said for men shall be lovers of their own selves now why in the world would he start out these passages of scripture when he would use to describe the conditions and the very first one that he would use was this about self-love now we know that all of us are given this something by instinct by natural birth whatever you want to call it and it is a protective thing within us and automatically if we're driving down the road and we see a brake lights within three quarters of a second your brain will respond and your foot will go on the brake pedal uh god made us that way and it's built in us to fight or flight and we will assess the situation and see what do i do do i have to fight in this situation or do i run there's something in us it's that natural something for us to survive is that true it's in all of us that that is not what we're referring to we feed ourselves we take care of ourselves you know we take a shower we comb our hair we do all these things and that's just being nice to the folks you're going to set aside in church that's right but yet there's something about all of us we have that protective mode that is in us is that right well don't look at me some of y'all said but some folks you wish they did take a shower but that is not what we're talking about but it's whenever we would love ourselves above god it's whenever we become so narcissistic that we put our love our desire for what we want the way we look at things it can be our thoughts it can be our opinions it can be our goals in life and we want them and we're going to achieve them it makes no difference who it hurts and we really don't care whether god likes it or not then this is the type of love that paul is framing so he said for men shall be lovers of their own selves now remember this is not providing for yourself and helping yourself so paul begins this list of 19 evils that will be prominent in the last days of what we will deal with and truly describes our times to a t in reality notice this first lovers of their own self so this self-esteem emphasis of our day certainly fits as well notice this in the fire tower church age in the church age book i want to give you a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax coal and the laodicean or last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of god so then when we look at this setting we're not talking about just people that's never even come to church don't know nothing about god you know somebody hand them a track on the street one day but we're talking about people that say they have known the lord they have walked with god but they become so involved in themselves so it's all about what they can get you know people come to church and they come to church that way they think everything in church ought to be regulated around them they think the temperature ought to be set the way theirs is in their home they think the music ought to be said according to the volume of the way they listen to it in their home well brother donnie go ahead and preach and they think this and this and this and this ought to be regulated about them now friends i hope you understand this is a very dangerous thing you are flirting with the laodicean self-love when you project your own taste your own position your own opinion and you will exalt that above the rest of the body you see as a body we come together and some people in their home they may keep it on 70. other people like it 72. i've been in some homes they're like at 76. [Music] i sweated the whole time but i endured it thank god i didn't have to stay long but praise the lord i was able to make it now you understand what i'm saying but you see and all that most people that have tolerance and understanding we know that when we come together as a group as a body it's going to be that it's going to be in the in the mix of it all but some are so self-centered that it's all about what i don't and i and i and you can hear them all the time they complain about this and they complain about that and what is their complaint centered around them their personal view well i don't understand how come we have to do that i don't understand why they haven't asked my opinion really you don't understand why i haven't asked your opinion [Music] i have a hard time dealing with self-opinionated opinionators who only wants their opinion carried out well glory to god so you see this is part now you imagine first of all out of 19 that this is one of the things that paul felt needed to be stressed first and immediately and to help people to see that it will be part of the spirit in the last day that our self-love for ourselves so that's our views our opinion i think i believe i believe this and that and the other notice in the prophet says in the laodicean or life's self love or love for material things will take place of the true love of god so it's not like that you can have this kind of love for yourself with the love of god totally impossible you cannot have this degree of love for yourself and have the love of god in your heart the way you need it for a rapture you see whenever we move into this type of love we actually have to forfeit the depths of the love of god that he wants us to have we cannot have both it's totally impossible because this degree of self-love is satanic praise the lord notice then the love for material things will take the place of the true love of god we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard now listen why because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit now you see this is what happens to church people as they said in church and they hear oh yeah oh yeah yeah i've heard that i've heard that i've heard that and they just take it you know well whatever and they really don't pay no attention and that well that'll never affect me that'll never affect me it's already affecting you if you think it won't affect you it's already moved to stage one in your life and it will come to where that it will become that it would take away your sensitivity to the spirit of god which will make your heart it'll make your heart against the word make your heart against singing of the songs of zion worshiping god and he begins to replace that with something else you see a lot of folks feel like that god made them the world's greatest critic and they really think them being such a great criticizer is a great thing well i'll tell you what the prophet of god said he asked the church and the random tabernacle to pray for him that god would get that spirit off of him for doing so much criticizing so if brother branham needed to repent and needed to get that criticizing spirit off of him i guarantee you most of us need to get it off of us don't consider that an attribute of god because it's not now what's this so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this life's day spirit it is time to draw night to god and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel listen now this is a warning we will feel the coldness of the last day church now he didn't say we were the last day church but we would actually start feeling the coldness of the last day church i don't know about you i don't want to feel that now i am not the last day church i'm part of the last day bride but as i as a laodicean living in this time frame as far as where we are i have to fight this thing off of me you've got to fight it off of you you've got to fight it off of you why because it is around us and there's nobody else that can do it for you and the church said or we will fill the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of god which alone is able to help us so they will be lovers of themselves paul said they will be self-centered they will be narcissistic now they will be so narcissistic and you know the word nor narcissism and all that so they will be so self-centered about themselves and this is the degree of selfishness that is condemned in regard to their own interest they don't care who it hurts they don't care who it offends they do not care if you know if the wife has to do without the husband has to do with that they're going to do whatever they want to do oh my so with their rights and i'm the head of the home and i'm you know this and that and the other so if i want to buy this and then we have to do without bread and we have to do without whatever more i'm going to do it because i'm the head of the home well i'll say this you ain't got no right to be the head with that kind of attitude what is that narcissism so it's all about you focusing on what you want how you want it and when you want it preach brother now you see it is their object of life which tramples down on the very epitome of the life of the lord jesus now when he come he went to the exact opposite because narcissism does not come from god but it comes from satan it is the base of this hateful selfish self-centered type of a life that we have to be careful so if someone loves now listen to me they actually move two degrees into this and they will start in this direction and they will move in the avenue of narcissism and then they will start loving themselves more and more and more and they become more defensive of themselves and they're thinking more about themselves now if you don't misunderstand me but then there's actually a degree that it moves beyond just loving themselves till they start worshiping themselves so they will spend excessive time in front of the mirror because they are so beautiful or they are so handsome certainly ain't no man here that think they're beautiful you big sis if you do oh my they just think they're god's greatest gift to women you know and they just so admire their self or they admire everything that they have done and they look at what they've accumulated in life and i have done this and i have done that and i am a self-made man that should never come out of your mouth if you're a child of god oh if you've got money and you're rich you ought to thank god if he could trust you with it you could have been a pauper you could have been homeless tonight living under one of the bridges here in johnson city if it was not for the grace of god but you see when we go to taking the blessing of god and pointing it toward us as if though we've done all this i've done this i've done that the lord jesus spoke about this very thing when he was here so then the person can move to a spot to where they no longer love themselves so deeply but they actually start worshiping themselves now they will never bow down and the reason that this confuses people when you talk about worship is because people don't understand worship people saying that one oh you can go around every day of your life there's so many opportunities you miss in worshiping god you can worship god at walmart you can worship god at lowe's you can worship god on your job that don't mean you're going down through lows riding the back of a buggy and you're shouting and screaming and speaking in tongues they'll throw you in jail but you can walk down through there and you can be praising god and loving god and thanking god come on friends we don't have to make ourselves peculiar and odd you can do it making an apple pie you can do it making up your bed is that right so what do you do you're giving him the homage of your heart you're giving him the deepest being that you are and you give that to him because it's reserved for him only but when a person goes to worshiping themselves then they go to recalculating everything of their life if they're a married woman a married man then they will pull everything every family activity everything around themselves so their day off is what is centered around them their time off well this is my time this is my day off this is my my mouth watch this now this is key words i me and mine and it's key words to see if you're worshiping yourself for worshiping god well hallelujah you see when it's all about you and your thoughts and your opinion and this and that another you're probably a self-worshiper now i want to tell you yourself never made yourself and it can't save yourself and it can't deliver yourself so you're worshiping a selfless powerless being so if i was you i'd quit worshiping you and shall worship in god because he's the only one that can help us out of the mess that we're in now people then notice this it was this that satan played upon eve in her state of ignorance as it was whenever he told her you shall be as gods now what did he offer her her being exalted above a place of understanding that god had already made man of god but it was he was offering something to her that it seemed like a mysterious something that she didn't know she didn't understand this she did not perceive it so he said you will be as god's own you mean i can be a god i can be a god can't you see why this age and scientific research and all the things that they've done why that most of the scientific people are above god they don't need god to believe in god is so puny so weak you know they look at us as morons and whatever more because we're not very scientific and we're not very smart poor brother donnelly he don't have no degrees and that's exactly right and i thank god i don't but if you can have one and still have faith praise the lord but if your degree ever comes against your faith don't get rid of your faith get rid of your degree so he offered them a godship so what so she could be able to worship something about herself so you mean i will become divine there will be something about me that will be so supernatural and so super spiritual and of course we know that he lied to her so then what happens is the truth of god is changed into a lie which is one of the prophecies of the last day and they will serve and worship the creature more than the creators that's your bible the book of romans so then the creator becomes what he becomes small unneeded insignificant all who needs god anymore who needs god anymore you know we've got science we can do this and that and tell me great scientists how many people have you let die a scientist was covered 19. tell me scientists why haven't you stopped guests yet tell me with all your laboratories why are people still getting old because god's word said they would is that right so no matter how much man wants him may make himself god he ain't no god he's deceived well praise the lord notice then so man shall be lovers of their own selves and then the second attribute to paul felt led to describe was covetous now the word use here for covetous is actually more more accurately rendered from the original is lovers of money so this is particularly the love of money so it's not just you know wanting this person's farm or this or that but it is more toward the root of this evil of the love of money the love of manny has been called the daughter of selfishness so covetousness would be something in the last day that would be a trademark or one of the signs of the time in first timothy chapter 6 verse 10 paul said for the love of money is the root of all evil now you hear people misquote this many times and they say that money is the root of all evil you're misquoting the bible the bible does not say money is the root of all evil but it is the love of money is the root of all evil now there are many rich people that god has entrusted with all kinds of money now i know most of you probably here do not think you are rich but i've been in many of the third world world countries uh you know in other places and believe me every one of you sitting here tonight or rich compared to them that's right but yet we know that there are some among us and even the message and in our ranks that would be considered rich but in reality they don't have the love of money they're able to take the money that god gives them and god and trust them with and they take that and send it here and books here and this that and the other help build churches and and many of them keep it to themselves they don't say one thing about it now if a person can do that that's quite a blessing from the lord but it's not money that is the root of evil but it is the love of money notice paul said for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted actor they have aired from the faith so you imagine now we're not talking about cigarettes and we're not talking about tv pornography but just people that would so want money so bad and loved money so bad and coveted so much that somehow they would trade it out wonder how they done it well i might have started out but taking a second job it might have started out by working on a double shift and they started missing this service that service that service and another service before long they really didn't care if they went to church or not because they was making more money than they'd ever had in their life and they began to sell out and lose their faith why all for the love of money now why is it about money is it just to hoard the money itself for many it's not that it's simply that money is a script and money will be able to buy them the things they want so they want a bigger house they want a boat they want a four-wheeler they want this they want that they want that they want that so they've got to have money in order to get all these things that they want oh my goodness i i i must be at the wrong church folks i am so sorry i i thought i was going to preach to my church tonight y'all as quiet as a bunch of baptists oh my notice he said that while some have coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierce notice satan never done it they pierced themselves through with many sorrows look friends much of our battles one day you're going to look back and realize mine many of our battles were not even the devil doing it the devil was sitting down on hell eating an ice cream and drinking a glass of iced tea and you was doing it yourself either by your mouth or by your thoughts or by your negativism or by your love of money or whatever more you imagine a person then would pierce themselves don't we have enough piercing going on without us doing it to ourselves and pierce themselves through with many sorrows oh my notice that he moves on from covetous to boasters well for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters boasters self-assuming valuing themselves beyond all others i'm gonna go in the office my officer and preach the rest of this valuing themselves beyond all others those who attribute to themselves honor which does not fairly belong to them boasters of their wealth and riches of their honor and their grandeur my goodness and i'm sure you've noticed already i have not mentioned drinking i've not mentioned pornography paul never mentioned prostitution he never even mentioned abortion as horrible as that is you mean boasting is one of the signs of the end time of people thinking they are so elevated and they know so much or they're so smart or they're so much prettier or they have so much more money and they have this attitude that they look down on people beneath them because they're not in their social class or their status that's one of the 19 descriptions of the life's day spirit well praise the lord revelation 3 17 describes this very well because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing nothing brother that is a broad statement i have need of nothing nobody can tell me anything i don't need to listen to a preacher i've got everything i need on the tapes i'm as smart as any preacher that ever was on this earth you're a revelation laodicean 3 17. [Applause] praise the lord have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked you see what self evaluation can do now they looked at themselves and they said i'm rich i'm increased with goods why look at me i absolutely don't need one thing not one thing but god's evaluation was they were blind they were wretched they were naked they were miserable and the worst thing about it was they didn't even know it so how in the world are you ever going to convince people like the first part of this phrase that they are actually the last part how are we ever friends for many we never will but think of it many of us and our former years of the church that we went to are in the status that we were in we were the first half of revelation 3 17. but god by his grace was able to help us see the last half of this verse and we were able to see we were wretched blind poor naked and miserable and we didn't even know it to grace open their eyes oh my why because boasting what does it tie back to the love of self and the estimation of oneself oh friends humility you know that's that that type of a word in this day we're living in so many self-help books so many books of how to you know love yourself and how to bring uplift yourself sure i understand that i understand that you've got to put yourself that's redeemed in the hands of god and you can be down on yourself and down on yourself that don't help your nobody else but whenever you are trying to lift your unregenerate self you're bragging on the wrong feller that's exactly right you're trying to oh self-help books with this and self-help for dummies and how to lift yourself up higher and how to be this how to be that don't you understand where all that's coming from the tree of knowledge of good and evil well praise be to god notice in revelation 18 7 how this thing the same thing carries right on over to the consummation of this church how much he has glorified herself now this is the roman catholic church and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she said in her heart i set a queen i am no little and shall see no sorrow now look at how the church and remember the protestantism will marry into catholicism and this will be the joint confession of all of those when it turns out of her into him remember there is a transition time it had to take place in the bride don't let the bright age term confuse you it's simply just the lifespan of time of the church age of laodicea it's not another age it's just that lifespan of time when we come out from being the church being recognized as the church being recognized that we were supposedly john 3 16 believers unworthy of grace and going to hell and this and that and the other and we come to an acknowledgement that we were not the church so much but we were the bride the called out the elected and even in the opening of the seals that the prophet would tell us i no longer call you church but i call you bride so what do we do we come out of the movement of her and we come in to him now we realize then that the church ages has been this movement of her but it will come in the very last increment of time in the laodicean church age that there is this span of time that people can come out of denominations and still be foolish virgin type and the prophet said it got to come out of her before it goes into him because when satan comes on the earth and this church merges into him there is no turning back you see once you come out of her into him there is no turning back and when the church the people that's able to make the foolish virgin when they come out of her before it goes into him satan there's still mercy for them but there before oh my before it goes into the consummation of the tribulation period it was changed from her to him and when it changes over to him he that is filthy is filthy still he that is holy is holy still what's this so men shall be lovers of their own selves and covetous and boasters and then he uses the word here proud the word here means haughty it is the attitude of a person who thinks they are better than others now let me tell you something tonight if you are privileged by the grace of god to see the reveal word of this hour the message of malachi 4 luke 17 revelation 10 all that it has nothing to do with you being better than anybody else it's the grace of god they actually was contempt now in order to fulfill this this prophetic word here proud they must i'm not talking about something that you do and your your child will maybe knock a home run and or your child will you know do something in sports and and you're so proud and you go up to oh honey i'm so proud of you you made 100 in biology and you made 100 in algebra one and you you i'm so proud of it that's not the type of pride that we're talking about uh but it's the pride that exalts your view of yourself and your status and it looks down on those that are beneath you maybe they aren't as privileged as you are financially or maybe even their revelation in the word that god has not entrusted them with the same scope of revelation that he has you and you have this about you that whenever you get around as well he don't know very much he's not very deep he's not you know so he kind of looked down do you understand your fulfilling second timothy 3 when you do that you see if god allows us to see something more than someone else it's god that did that it's not you it's not because you prayed so much and you you've done this well i deserve it you don't deserve one thing you deserve to go to hell as far as the flesh is concerned oh my god may god help us friends i don't want to be none of this to you now look we must take warning we must take warning this is not written to infidels this is not written diagnostic this is written to the believers this this letter is actually written to a man of god timothy this is written to a man of god and that man of god was going to take that word but wonder why timothy didn't go around and just read this but instead timothy went around and preached it that's why i don't go around just play tapes [Applause] because what i hear on them tapes is preach the word [Applause] hallelujah notice for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers this don't mean what you think look at the meaning of this word speaking evil slanderous reproachful railing abusive so when people will slander a servant of god not just a preacher a servant of god when they will slander a christian a child of god you understand what they're doing blaspheming read your greek lexicon this is the word paul used speaking evil slanderous reproachful railing abusive so when people will put things about us me you the children of god whoever they are whether they are preachers or not and they will fabricate things and slander our name and run us down and trying to make us look evil they're blaspheming amen [Music] now let's bring it on down a little farther if you do it so are you [Music] oh my you know what friends we'd be a whole lot better off if we keep this thing right here in our mouths and keep them gates closed and keep him fingers right there off of a lot of keyboards if you ain't got enough sense to have facebook get rid of it if facebook makes you look like a dummy get rid of it amen mother johnny notice blasphemy matthew 12 31 wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh the word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come so the spirit of god moving on us and we would shout and worship god and praise the lord the holy ghost moves on men of god to anoint them to pray for the sick and to lay hands on them and they cast out devils and they're healed and people would look at it or hear it and say that's an evil spirit you just crossed the line there's no hope for you because blasphemy is to call the work of god an evil spirit think about it now this is only one aspect by which blasphemy is addressed notice in romans chapter 2 verse 22 thou that sayest to man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrence titles dost thou commit sacrilege thou that make us thou boast of the law through breaking the law dishonores thou god for the name of god is bliss themed among the gentiles through you now you imagine that people can actually become the channel by which people blaspheme the name of god now here paul is not complementing those but he's actually rebuking them because they were saying don't you do this and don't you do that and he said and yet some of you turn around do the same thing that you say don't do and then other people will look at that and they're watching you and they actually blaspheme the name of god and say there's nothing to christianity there's nothing to jesus christ there's nothing to the cross there's nothing to the blood because look at what so and so does so they actually blaspheme through your false testimony wonder if we could social distance and have an altar call tonight i think we all might need to hit it my my for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you as it is written notice in titus 2 3 the aged women likewise that they be in behaviors becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed so you mean christian women can actually by neglect in their life by not being the right kind of mother by not being the right kind of wife of course why would people blaspheme the name of god because you may be the only christian that they ever see and they see the way you live and they see what you do and they will look and say if that is christianity i want nothing to do with it while they lie and they cheat and they steal and they do this and that and the other and she gets on facebook and runs down everybody in the church and if that's christianity if that's what jesus does i don't want nothing to do with him and you imagine through the channel of your testimony they blaspheme the very name work and program of almighty god notice another aspect of blasphemy revelation 13 3 and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast course it changes from romanism under the uh other aspect of the emperors unto the more spiritual supposed aspect of it and the deadly wound was healed and it raises back up with this great power and they worship the dragon which gave power unto the beast now the dragon is satan and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him and that was given unto him a mouse speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and two months while this is going on on the earth you're enjoying a marriage supper and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven so you are gone the rapture is already completed he is still so mad he's blaspheming the name of god bless them and the tabernacle of god blaspheming you there you are in heaven dwelling in heaven can't you see when people get under a blasphemous anointing to ridicule to criticize they have nothing good to say their life is filled with bitterness and hatred can't you see how scary that is and yet many of those would never touch a cigarette they would never press a bottle of whiskey to their lips or a beer and they're as rotten and corrupt as the serpent himself because their life and their spirit and their attitude is so filled with bitterness and hatred may god help us if you're able stand to your feet oh my think of the children what a day to be living let me just read this verse two of two again for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy of all the things that he could have described as i said where's prostitution where's homosexuality where's aborting babies he could have wrote that prophetically that wasn't even doing it at this time but he could have prophetically wrote it down if god wanted it but something like being disobedient to parents unthankful not appreciating things that god and people do for you and this is the attitude of laodicea you owe everybody something that's the attitude that people have you owe it to me and that's the way they come to god god you owe it to me if god gave you what he owes you you'd be burning tonight i'm telling my cause it's warm in this church but this is the attitude and this is what many people expect from their government many people don't want to work they don't want to provide i reckon they figure the government makes money the government does not make money the government takes taxes and they dispute distribute that tax money the government does not make money the government is not a money-making business they're a money blowing business but the mindset of so many the americans are what give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me more than you give them give me give me give me give me more and many people come to church of the same attitude give me give me give me give me i want i want i want i want but the attitude of the lord jesus was i want to give away i want to give away it's not what can you give to me he didn't come and say what can you give to me larry what can you give to me gary but he said these words the son has come that you might have life and you might have it more abundantly guess what friends these things that we've read right here tonight if we stop and don't go any farther these things we've read right here tonight is split in many message churches you get a selfish person in there whether it's a businessman or a preacher or you know whatever it is he wants his own agenda and he's not willing to step over here and be what god wants him to be he wants to be the associate pastor wants to be this and that or the other same with musicians same with songwriters saying with whatever more they have their agenda they're never appreciated they're never used oh my their gifts are so great and well god just oh god just gifted them so much their attitude is what keeps them from going any farther they'll never go any farther me you i don't care who it is if brother branham would have had that attitude god would have never used the man he could may god help us you kids i'm going to spare you a little bit tonight and i'm going to deal with this again oh you say next wednesday brother donnie i'm not going to tell you who knows a might trick can preach it on sunday [Applause] well i'm not coming next wednesday i'm not sure when i'm going to preach it yet you see so i got to studying for sunday today i i was having office time everywhere else being pulled i wanted to preach sunday cummings message tonight oh god please let me some of y'all wish i had him huh look children this is what separates us from the church it ain't just your hair sisters it ain't just your skirts they identify us as the skirt church we're more than the skirt church we're this church hallelujah if we're just different by our skirts we're as lost as they are this is what helps us his word it's about our heads together lord jesus heavenly father lord god i pray first of all would you mind searching me first off would you point your great light as it were inside of me see if you see anything in me lord that displeases you am i proud am i arrogant lord search me help me if you show me anything father i'll make it right if i have to do it before the world i will keep me lord we live in this day and we rub shoulders with the people of the day but more than that we feel this influence around us in the world of demonology there's not a person here that hasn't dealt with some of these things if not many of them they feel it come against them sometimes they catch it and sometimes we don't but lord help us we don't want to be proud we don't want to be blasphemers we don't want to ridicule people and run them down and we know in the age that we're living people don't care one bit to do it not even based upon truth and facts as a matter of fact the truth is really not the greatest thing people want to promote in this day most people don't want truth it's too plain it's too too simple it has to be fabricated and more added to it and lies sell much much much more newspapers live sells many more videos and gets you a whole lot more hits on youtube that way you get paid back from youtube more for your advertisements so you get more money so it don't really matter if you have to stretch the truth just a little bit and you leave out this and that and the other because if you did that then that would fully expose your lives god we don't want pain we want to be honest straightforward faithful help us lord god we don't want to just be known by our skirts of our sisters the long hair we don't want to just be known because we don't drink beer and wine and oh that sort of thing we want the very word of god to be so living out of our lives but that old man is so dead he don't have no control over us anymore and there's a brand new nature living inside of us and we were reunited with another nature and we got our marriage certificate and that germ that was to be us was in us before the world began so there is a life that will follow that term i pray for those in the visible audience under the sound of my voice i pray for those lord god out on the internet those that will pull the service up lord whether wherever they are may you help them help each of us father that our lives can be able to answer these words we love you father forgive us if we've entertained these spirits forgive us lord if we've yielded our instruments it just amazes me that people think that all they have to watch is smoking and pornography lord some of these things right here have destroyed many more people than that help us god thank you lord jesus for coming to this earth and being a man and feeling our temptations and able to overcome every bit of it and say be of good cheer i have overcome the world we worship you tonight lord god i wonder how many of you with everhead bowed and those of you that mean it from the sincerity of your heart you would just like to raise your hand to the lord jesus and by that you're going to say lord help me to be the right kind of a person if i've done one or two or many of these things forgive me lord if i've been proud arrogant if i've looked down on others forgive me lord i i didn't realize lord that it it was this this wrong i didn't realize it was this serious i'm sorry if there's christians in our church or christians in other church and i've looked down on them because their clothes and maybe their shoes had holes in them and they were ragged and the car they drove and i really just had a bad attitude toward them forgive us lord forgive us lord god if we've slipped up and people have looked at us and said you mean that's a christian forgive us lord god if we've ever displayed pride arrogance in a wrong way father help us lord we want to be under this spirit of the last days that's holy filled with love we want to trade hard-headedness and stubbornness and rebellion for submission and love and forgiveness lord jesus we want to be like you your prophet would come when he would go to preach that absolute astounding sermon perfect faith and the scriptures that he would read and say if you do not forgive men their trespasses neither will your father forgive yours and then he would make this comment so we see that faith is based upon forgiveness so we'll never be able to move into the realm of perfect face as long as we're holding grudges and someone said something against us and we think about it and mull over it and it may be a year it may be two it may be three but we will wait for the opportunity to get back at him help us to realize lord that's not your nature that's not your spirit that's satan anointing our ishmael because he's a wild man he's a stubborn hard-headed donkey of a man oh anoint our isaac lord hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus hey let's sing something together and just worship him a little bit you love him saints with all your heart was all your heart your soul your strength how many wants to be this type of a believer this type of a christian the lord jesus can use you oh my it's amazing how many people want to have such power to lay hands on the sick preachers are so envious of each other if one man's gifted above another and more supernatural follows his ministry oh it's awful it's awful among preachers how that thing is is so so terrible but i wonder how many wants to be like jesus and forgiveness wants to be like jesus and turning the other cheek you don't find very many people jealous of that why we don't esteem it high enough we do not esteem it as one of the greatest things we could ever get from jesus christ to be able to love like him to forgive like him to be able to look at those that hate you and not feel hatred inside of you but to look at them with compassion and mercy and say father forgive them forgive them i want to be like jesus sing something harry can we just worship him a little i know you kids i've got school maybe and some of you got work tomorrow and all that so let's just let's just worship him a little look friends just take advantage of every one of these opportunities this coveted situation's increasing again hopefully god will keep it away from us for they won't shut us down but you we don't know what the government's going to do to us we do not know under this incoming administration what they're going to do let's take advantage of every time we have the opportunity to come to the house of god don't slack up praying keep on praying god will send this thing back to hell and get get deliver his people
