praise the lord we appreciate your choir don't we just want to quickly say it's been about six years ago that brother Louie's invitation that I came to Happy Valley for the first time it's most likely The Darkest Hour of my life but I remember sitting back in the back of the Assembly of the Happy Valley and feeling such an intense presence I know today the Lord never left me but I felt that Shekinah presence that I just not felt in a long time Venture each time I came I'd always at five hour drive I'd want to get here early and I'd sit at the back I'd always get here about an hour early and just to fill that presence about a year and a half ago I got introduced to brother Ron his assembly about an hour or so closer to home so I've been there some quite a bit and I found myself doing the same thing I get there early and sit at the back and it's hit me that it's more than just as you can a presence it's you it's the wonderful presence of the people of God we live in this world that

that means y'all can help sing it as long as I can remember if I don't then y'all keep going anyway in the town of Bethlehem God came down to visit man wasn't bad in love wasn't that love he knew pain and loneliness as he wore that robot flesh wasn't that love who wasn't that love as he stood in Pilot's Hall he never said a word at all wasn't that in love wasn't that love love he heard the mob Yale crucified but he knew he came to die wasn't that love or was that love wasn't that in love how he lift his home above to die your Calvary just to save someone like me every day I'm still amazed there's only one thing lived to see wasn't that love who wasn't that love as he laid there in that tune he did what he came to do wasn't that love wasn't that love but he rose up from the grave so that we could live today it wasn't that love oh wanna wasn't that love how he left his home above to die on Calvary just to save a rich like me every day I'm still amazed there's only one thing lived to say wasn't that love or was in that love up wasn't that in love foreign [Music] just to save someone like me every day I'm still amazed there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love who wasn't that love now every day I'm still amazed there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love church wasn't that love whoa amen [Applause] what great love I'm sure that most of us even that love him and have been living for him for a long time we still probably understand so very little about such a great love for him to become a man would have been such an act of condescension but for him to become sin to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself for he who knew no sin became sin that he might become the very righteousness that we might become of God in him I'm so grateful for today aren't you I just wonder what it's going to be like when all the great singers and musicians that have lived down through time that have given their talent to God when they all gather together that'd be one thing about the singers and the musicians I figure this they'll be singing and playing preachers won't preach no more you talk about an eternal retirement plan yeah so you preach for 30 or 40 years whatever it is and then you get Eternal retirement so be no preaching no prayer lines no older calls nothing like that but what a time of rejoicing and praising and loving and worshiping him I'm sure our minds just cannot comprehend it but until we get to that time there's many talls and snares no doubt that we will be faced with and ups and downs in life so I think he equips us with what we need in this life's journey to help us to make it if you have your Bible and you'd like to turn with me today to the Book of Luke chapter 8 verse 49 and certainly welcome you here today and trust that if you come to receive something from the Lord that he will be able to minister to your needs been speaking here for uh several services on the bride's Bill of Rights and today on I'd like to speak to you on a life above ungodly fear a life above ungodly fear how many knows there is a fear that's right and true we know of course the Old Testament teaches us that that fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge and there's a reverential fear that we should have for our parents and so on but there is a fear that is absolutely ungodly Unholy and we should not be captured by it so there's a life that we can live above ungodly fear Luke chapter 8 verse 49. the setting is of course Jarius and he's come to the Lord Jesus and asked for help because his daughter is sick little does he know of course that while he's on his journey his daughter has died and we will break into that part of the story right there while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master but when Jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not What A peculiar response so the man's daughter is dead 12 years old the wife is no doubt Torn to Pieces by this time the mourners are already there wailing and mourning as it was the custom of the people and the Lord Jesus says don't be afraid everything's good can you imagine how odd that must have seen me imagine what you all would respond to me if I walked into your house and your husband your wife your baby just died and said everything's good God's got it all in control don't be afraid you'd probably look at me and saying poor old guy he's lost his mind but you see this is the type of fear that God does not want his children to have listen but when Jesus heard it he answered and saying answered him saying fear not believe only believe only in that amazing it's backwards the way that we said most the time we say only believe but he said believe only and she shall be made whole so the heart is stopped the blood pressure is gone the blood is start coagulating in the body you know imagine the reversal of all this that's got to take place for this one word whole the blood is still you know what it does it coagulates it clots the arteries start collapsing the heart muscle is dead Jesus says she will be whole look at this word fear where Jesus said they're fearing on look up here at the Greek word what it actually means a phobia while we're living in a phobia age aren't we listen what it means to be afraid of put to flight by terrifying to scare away to be struck with fear to be seized with alarm how many has ever had it over and over again haven't we we've all experienced this type of thing phobias phobias notice with me again in Luke chapter 12 verse 32 the Lord Jesus again different setting same words fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom fear not little flock for it is notice how he punctuates this it is your father's good pleasure God gets pleasure out of giving us the kingdom Romans 8 15. for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again the spirit of bondage again to fear that ye have received the spirit of adoption I hope you understand what I'm going to say there's a difference in fear and the spirit of fear it's embred in us fight or flight since the fall to feel alarmed somebody pulls out in front of you you react within three-quarters of a second to break there's certain fear that will save your life but then there's a spirit of fear that can get on people and it takes the spirit of God to deliver them for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption now Paul's going to say some very peculiar words here which is only coined by the Lord Jesus himself in the Book of Mark whereby we cry Abba father Abba father I mean glad to be remembered today as we pray just told your request in your heart father we love you today we so thank you for the opportunity that we can be gathered together Lord Jesus may you come and speak to our hearts no doubt among these hundreds of people that are here today the needs are so many and so diverse some Lord facing great decisions in their life some maybe just heard of terrible doctor's report this week some may be father or loved one is gone away from the way of the what righteousness and truth they're so heavy here today some maybe it's a husband or a wife maybe it's a wayward loved one Lord you know what we all need we're bringing our petitions before you today we have confidence in you that you're mindful of us in the name of Jesus I bind every evil spirit that would try to hinder this service in the name of Jesus Christ May every foul Spirit from hell take your flight in the name of Jesus Christ open our hearts father to your word that we might be able to receive from you for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you you may be seated I find it to be amazing that people that have been delivered from things can once again take on a spirit of bondage it can be bondage to a man it can be bondage to a church it can be bondage to a system it can be bondage to a previous thing that they've overcome and they find themselves under the same thing again maybe it's a habit maybe it's something that God set you free from it got a little cold and a little indifferent and you find yourself picking up some of those things that you laid aside but Paul says you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear the fear is something that Adam and Eve never experienced in the Garden of Eden before the fall they knew an amount of joy and fulfillment and happiness that to be honest none of us have ever experienced we've known happiness it's short-lived many times we've known joy and we're saying oh my we get a new child and our family or a grandchild or you know a promotion in your job or something and it makes you happy but you know how it is it's short-lived and then something else will come up and it seems like it takes that joy and that happiness from you think where did it go you had it 30 minutes or an hour or maybe a day or two and it's gone but can you imagine living in a paradise of God to where they never knew any sadness they never knew any any feeling of Gloom that never got up one day and felt great and then by noon some bad news came and changed it all and they were just heartbroken for several several days that's our life but every day was the same every day was beautiful every day was awesome the presence of God being around them every day they lived in this absolute wonderful world that he'd made for them and they never knew any type of sadness no Gloom no type of weariness no fear whatsoever until they make their choice to Step Beyond the boundary of the word that it was God's custom of course to come in the evening time because God would lay them down to sleep and rest so the sun started setting and Adam and Eve would go up to the Cathedral of trees but this day happened and whenever they knew it was time for him to come they began to feel this peculiar strange feeling it was all new to them they never experienced it before their flesh must have begun to tremble somewhat and they got anxious maybe their face began to flush their blood pressure began to rise that never felt that before either and they begin to feel so strange and so unusual didn't even know what to call it didn't even know how to identify it and then God came down as was his custom and God didn't find him in church every day before this they was in church every day every day they was in church the great synagogue was not made of stone and it was not a temple of gold and silver but it was the beautiful trees that God had made in Paradise the birds the animals the flowers the streams the rivers the waterfalls must have been absolutely breathtaking but now Adam could no longer enjoy them he could not feel the same way just that he did the day before and he's trying to ponder what is this feeling that I'm feeling I've never felt this before and he hears the voice of God as it comes walking in the garden and the cool of the day and God was saying Adam Adam Adam where are you Adam my boy and then I can hear this sweet voice say I'm over here I hid myself because I'm afraid the first time the human being says this terrible word I'm afraid and I hid myself the first time a human being hides from God's presence have you eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat come out face my judgment it must have been a horrible day you see that seems strange for you and I all we've known since we were just we children we started experiencing fear most of you probably can't even remember the first time you felt it it's probably a baby as I was probably a wee baby the first time this emotion came over me and I didn't know what to do so all I did was cry and scream like you did I didn't know what to say I couldn't talk I didn't know how to express it but I felt this feeling and I didn't like it so I began to scream and cry kick my feet and what I want my mama but now of course I'm 67 years old so I felt the fear of sickness the fear of betrayal the fear of not understanding God's will the fear that I'll failing the fear of man the fear of government the fear of people that you don't know the fear of flying the fear of storms the fear of lightning the fear of high winds on and on and on I could go my life like yours hardly a day goes by that I don't encounter some type of fear maybe it's the fear of the economy the fear of you being able to pay your bills the fear of how will I provide for my family and as a man that makes you nervous makes you very nervous if you love your family you want to provide for them you go to looking and thinking God what must I do how can I be able to make it it's my responsibility to provide for my family so you try to better yourself and meet with this disappointment that disappointment you ever notice how when disappointments come of that sort there can be an element of fear that will grip your heart because it seems to produce an uncertainty and you just don't know what the future is and you can look around and see that food's higher than it's been inflation's going up wages aren't keeping up with it and the price of bread is going up you bought gas in the last few weeks it's gone up everything is going up well that's what I'm waiting for too to go up but until I do and until you do we will constantly experience fear my brother Donnie you said that we can live a life that is above ungodly fear yes we can I do not believe according to God's word that God wants us to be controlled by fear though in our mechanism of humanity it is an automatic response as I stood some few months ago in my kitchen and Carol called me and she was with Erica down at the hospital in Sycamore Shoals and they done a scan on her brain because she was saying some things that wasn't quite right and they were just alarmed by it so they did a scan and they found in her brain that the cancer which is almost impossible for the neuro or endocrine cells to move because of the blood block to go up to the brain but that devil found a way to go into her brain Kel told me Donnie you need to come down here because they've they've found this and I I think we need you here when Carol spoke those words to me instantly I felt my face flush red I felt my blood pressure go up I never have blood pressure problems thank the Lord but I felt it go up I felt my heart pounding within my chest and I said okay I'll change my clothes and I'll be down there just in a few minutes but I as I begin to get ready to go down to the hospital I remembered what the Lord God had spoke to me at that same Hospital in Sycamore Shoals I had taken Erica down for a a scan an MRI I was setting out in the waiting room with my laptop and my lap is on Wednesday so I was going to preach Wednesday night and I sat there on my laptop in my lap setting uh in the waiting area for service on Wednesday night and while I was sitting there the spirit of God spoke these words to me do not fear their scans believe my word so I wrote down what he said I wrote down the date and I wrote down the time when God tells you something it don't lie you know that's right don't you because you've had him speak to you so whenever we got back the result of that scam there was nothing bad no bad report at all so I thought huh God didn't tell me that for nothing months went by so here I walk into the ER and I find Erica there laying down to find Carol setting by her side and again I was reminded and I told them whenever I walk in I said remember it was in this same Hospital not the same room but the same hospital that the Lord spoke to me months ago and someone printed it out for Erica and she's got it there you know or she can be reminded of it but my first reaction in my human makeup was what not Joy not excitement fear how many knows what I'm talking about this morning now does that mean that I did not believe does that mean you do not believe whenever we hear things that will alarm us does that mean when we experience this type of fear or phobia that we are doubting God it does not it simply means that through one of the ten Gates that Satan has access to see taste feels smell hear the outer court and then to the second Court which is the spirit imagination conscience memory reason and affection these are ten Gates that he tries to access the human being to be able to get into the real Court which is the soul now our reaction no doubt will always be to respond first humanly and then whenever the spirit of God can gain control then we will calm the outer five gates and calm the inner five gates and then start ruling from the throne room of the soul I mean he understands what I'm saying now the sad part about it is that there are many Christians that live under a spirit of bondage now Paul is using the words here that was identified with slavery now slavery is a terrible terrible thing whether it's natural or spiritual now during the time here of course in the Book of Romans was written it was a time of slavery on the earth we know our own Nation had its own black dark Years of Slavery here in America but I'm going to tell you something I believe there's more slaves in America today than there ever has been before now they're not necessarily their bodies owned by someone else but it is their souls and their minds and their objectives and their motives and people who always sing of the land of the free in the home of the brave but I wonder how many in America today are truly free many of them are bound by addictions to alcohol and addictions to drugs and many of them are bound by addictions to pornography and addictions of all sort come on somebody preach with me some of them are addicted to this and that and the other and they cannot make it without having something to help them to get up something to help them to go to sleep something to carry them over in the middle of the day what a sad time we're living in so it is the spirit of bondage again that has got so many people and yet Paul is contrasting the spirit of bondage with the spirit of adoption so you know the slave would be under constant fear the slave would constantly now none of us of course here setting here today I now say under the sound of my voice anywhere around the world have been a slave on the natural sense so it'll be hard for us to relate to it some of our our brothers and sisters and their their families several Generations black back that would be of the black brothers and sisters and no doubt maybe some of their grandfathers or great-grandfathers it would be that would tell them about that and how that they was owned by another human being which is an abomination in the eyes of God God never ordained such a thing God made all men free it was man that made slaves not God come on but you and I might not be able to relate to someone owning your body but I dare say every one of us can relate to being under uh an element of spiritual slavery and what's so sad is when people have found the Lord and been able to meet him and recognize that he is the Redeemer and he set them free from the bondage of sin and then they come into serving him and they obtain another form of slavery which is a spiritual slavery and there's still Christians they still love the Lord they go to church but they go to a church that doesn't really preach all the truths now you know we believe we're living in a rapturing time a rapturing age I personally believe by the dispensations of of God's light to the gospel that you can notice whenever God released his power and there was four beasts in the Book of Revelation and when those four Beast Powers were was released the spirit of God lifted up a standard and released an anointing from the Throne of God that would combat that power on the earth in order to be an overcomer in that age you had to be Anointed with that Spirit to ever overcome it so is it today so if this is an age like never been before it's going to take more than the ox anointing it's going to take more than the man anointing it's going to take the eagle anointing in the Book of Revelation that we have to come and hear what he has to say to the church in this end time and yet many people go to church and they don't understand the first principle about where we are in the dispensation of time to me that is so sad so Paul contrasts the bondage of slavery with the freedom of the people of God under the spirit of adoption now he says you've not received the spirit of bondage again now how sad that that people that would have been released from the spirit of bondage and they drank and they cursed and they run around they lived you know terrible terrible lives and then they come into some sort of church system and when they come into that church system and they find themselves saved but they don't find themselves totally set free and they come right back into another bondage again and they become slaves to some sort of religious system which many times can be worse than what they was in out there in the world it's harder to get a religious man and to see that he's wrong many times and it is a sinner out here that knows he's lost but a religious spirit is seven times worse than any other devil in hell I want you to think about that because of religious spirit will try to convince people that they're all right oh you live as good as they do you're okay you go to church every now and then whether you need to or not you help the poor and you do this and that and you know you're good you're good I'll tell your friend that's not the kind of thing you want to die by that ain't the type of thing I want to live by I want to live by a gospel that will be able to present me to the Lord Jesus as a bride of Christ but so many today are under the spirit of bondage again but you don't have to be unless you choose to be now notice Paul then says we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry now I want you to notice that we have received the spirit of adoption so adoption was of course taken from the Greeks and the Romans and whereby that even if you were born into a family and you was of their genus their seed their kind their blood and it was your fathers and but sure for sure that you belong to them but you didn't just get your inheritance automatically because you was of the Reagan family or the Smith or whoever you are but you had to go through it for a time of child training a time of proving so they would set you under a governor or one that would be able to train you and that Governor would give constant reports to the father of your behavior and it was your behavior that determined the amount of inheritance that you received now you might have a birth certificate and a birth record and proved yes you was born on that certain certain day it was not the birth certificate that gave you your inheritance but rather it was your behavior and as the governor come back and report it to the father and he said your boy is really doing good he's 18 now and I'll tell you I gave him authority to do this and do that and he is really doing good I gave him permission to be able to use your name and write a check the other day I sent him down there I went along with him and then I told him I said now take take your father's Goods out there and barter and trade and sell and I just kind of stood off and I watched him and I watched the way he'd done and he took those sheep and traded them out because we needed some donkeys and we needed a few camels and I watched him and he he didn't stick nothing in his pocket no under the table sort of saying I'm telling you how he's doing good you'll imagine when that father would hear that report he said oh my that's my boy oh that's wonderful well I'll tell you what governor what I want you to do is I want you to give him just a little bit more Authority and watch him now I just kind of don't let him know you're watching him but give him a little bit more stuff let him have a little bit more of my name let him have a little bit more liberality and watch him give him a little bit more in his allowance and watch what he'll do what if that boy got out there and he found him down there in a gambling Den somewhere and he found him doing things that he wouldn't do his father if he's a real good father he's not going to give him more Authority he's not going to give him more money but actually he's going to pull back until that boy proves that he can be trusted well I hope somebody's sharing me today God wants us to be adopted Sons and Daughters of God let me just give you a little preview of what God is looking for in this age it's not church membership it's not people that can just come and be there and be a part of church but the prophet of God said he hoped and prayed that he would live for the hour that was going to rise when the sons of God would stop disease they would stop cancer not just pray for it but stop it that will not come if father can't trust us how many preachers do we have that God could give them the power and authority to stop cancer or how many of them would take that power and become a stuffed shirt well I prayed for this one and I did this and I did that you see where that's our report card we're telling father what we're going to do okay father now this is the way I'm going to behave when you give me Authority this is what I'm going to do I'm going to take part of the credit for me you're not sending father a good report about your behavior you see father will do the same thing with a singer or a songwriter or a musician he will give us talents and give us abilities and then according to the way it affects our makeup boy can I sing good what do y'all think Don I sing good wow what a singer I Am you realize you're just cutting yourself off for more of the supply line so what do we want to do the more God uses us the littler we get not the bigger we get and then if that is the equation and that is the way we put it together that the more God does the more we humble ourselves and we keep ourselves small in our own sight and I found this out years ago it doesn't really matter how many people that the devil puts around the man of God to try to exalt him and you watch it he'll do it every time every time God will raise up a man Satan will put people around him who will try to make an idol out of him well if he understands that he will constantly cut that down he'll strike it he'll strike it or they'll get sick of hearing it but you got to trust him because he knows what he's doing well he's in no danger of that hurting him until he himself begins to believe it you see so Satan will put people around him oh brother they ain't nobody he preaches like you they ain't nobody can sing like you they ain't nobody oh I've heard preachers preach and I'll tell you what I believe you've just about got the greatest Ministry and the message you better watch it you better watch it but as long as that man resents it coming from the congregation and he strikes against it there's no danger of that serpent biting him because the blood will be too rich but then what Satan will try to do is change the tactic and try to attack him personally and convince him to where he begins to look at himself and he Compares himself with other ministers well you know God is using me in a greater way than this brother and that brother and our church is bigger and we've got bigger bigger bigger more more more more more and the way to get bigger bigger more and more and more is get little little little little because when we get bigger bigger bigger and begin to think bigger bigger bigger we're getting a stuffed head and we ain't going to be able to go no farther in God I wish somebody would preach with me this morning and you know we send God that and then whenever we send God this message then God can no longer be able to reflect in us more of the abundance of the spirit of adoption now we can walk into a phase of that and the more we get there the more the anointing under the Equal anointing of the last day under the old of the Seven Seals that the spirit of adoption will be released believe what you want think whatever you want I believe will write on the verge of the greatest thing we have ever seen in our entire lives I think we will Marvel at what the Lord God will do in front of us if we will be able to stay little and small and humble ourselves in his presence but the very moment we begin to look at ourself and think we're this and that and the other we might as well close the doors and all just go back home because God will start cutting off the supply line because you see it's not just enough to say well I'm a preacher well that can be part of your adoption well I'm a song leader I'm a deacon I'm a trustee but that within itself is the mechanical side of adoption that you see adoption has two sides that is the mechanical side and the spiritual side which is the dynamic side and we can take the mechanics oh yes I'm a preacher I'm a pastor I'm a missionary I'm this I'm that that's the mechanical sign but it takes the dynamic side in order to anoint our mechanical side that will produce the works of the Messiah now if not it'll just produce our own work so I'll tell you right now minding your Works ain't going to raise the dead mind of your works is not going to stop cancer come on somebody minding your works is not going to produce the works of Saint John 14 12 that if any man believe on Me Or Glory these things he's going to do is that what your Bible tells us in Saint John 15 7 if you abide me and by words abide in you ask what you will Psalms 37 and 4 Delight thou self also in the Lord and He will give Thee the desires of thine heart whatever you ask in my name I will do it beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in hell even as thy soul prospers that's God's word and we quote the mechanical side and then we cut our own throats from the dynamic side the very moment we become exalted can I go on you're saying please please we don't like this devil well it's part of it you see us children we need protection and help I don't mind telling you I need protection not from just demons I need protection from me and you know who you need protection from the most don't look at over at your wife uh don't look at your youngins take your mirror out and take a selfie it's you you are your greatest enemy now I want you to notice the words that Paul uses here in Romans when he says that you have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry so this is not shouting now this is not jumping this is not rejoicing but the word that he uses look at the word that he uses we cry so we cry Abba father the other is actually an Aramaic word strange why that Paul would use this just like Jesus did so it's a word that is in the original Aramaic language so the translation the Greek translators when they translate this they just left it in this form but whenever they use the second word Abba which and then Father which is Peter p-a-t-e-r tater so Paul is addressing how that we when we come to God under the spirit of adoption that we need to pray in this way dear father Abba Abba not father father but dear or sir it's a petition that Jesus Christ himself coined it's a time of need and great desperation you mean after the spirit of adoption yes so we don't become exalted so we move from the realm of fear and move over into the spirit of adoption so we need children that of God that will cry out and recognize their needs so we address him in the language of affection and enduring confidence Abba Father Abba Father dear father precious father my father Hallelujah this is from the word the Chaldean word a B in the Old Testament the Chaldean word for father so the union of the two words of a father is an endeared relation that we have with God so notice this again in in Genesis chapter 22 verse 7 the first time AB is used in the Bible is when Isaac is following his father and Isaac is a is a well-taught boy he knows the order of worship so his father tells him look son Let's Go appear to this certain certain place that God would tell us and we're going to offer an offering to the Lord so he gets the wood and he lays it on Isaac's back and he gets the fire you imagine Isaac starts thinking brother Jack now wait a minute here's the wood here's the fire but there's no offering how are we going to worship God without an offering I'll tell you one thing I think our young people would be much better off to be able to talk the right approach to worship then and instead of spending so much time on video games spending so much time feeling their head with all different types of movies that shouldn't even be watched in the first place spending so much time on Facebook and Instagram and here and there and there this boy knew how to worship God he's a lad and he's pondering and Isaac spoken to Abraham his father unsaid my Abba notice how he coins this now my my eyebrow why is he saying this it is a petition of submission to his father's will now this is a long arduous Journey he doesn't even know where they're going he doesn't understand why they're going this way without a lamb Abraham probably by this point knows that God is going to require him as far as he knows to present his son's life as a sacrifice but Isaac still doesn't know it but yet he's submitting himself to his father's will and being in this submissive State he calls upon his father in these terms my father not just Abba but my father I trust you I don't understand what you're doing I don't understand what's going on my father and he said you're am I my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering now he has complete faith and trust in his father Dawson utter one word of discontentment and this hard difficult Journey because he trusted but now he's seeking for understanding and he doesn't approach his father with an attitude oh Hallelujah but he says my father my Abba my Abba I need help and Abraham answers back my boy son my son what a relationship my father yes my son I don't want to just know him as father I want to be able to address him as my father Hallelujah Hallelujah but now we must be coming anxious by the Jack and wondering and maybe it's the sins of fear oh Noah daddy you're you're not surely you're not thinking of doing what the Canaanites do for the Canaanites offer their children to their gods surely that's not what you're going to do my father why are you letting me go through this my father yes my son where's the sacrifice my father my son God will provide for himself apparent elephant David declares God as being the father of the children of Israel forever First Chronicles 29 10. wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and David said blessed be thou Lord God Jehovah Elohim of Israel our Abba forever and ever Isaiah coins the same term he writes about the Everlasting name of Abba Father Our Redeemer Isaiah 63 16 doubtless Thou Art Our Father though Abraham be ignorant of us and Israel acknowledge us not thou O Lord art our Abba Our Redeemer Hallelujah notice he also in sorts the acknowledgment to the people of God in Isaiah 64 8 but now O Lord Thou Art Our Father we are the clay and thou art the Potter we are the work of thy hands Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 19 but I said how shall I put thee among the children and give thee a pleasant land a goodly Heritage of the hosts of the Nations and I said Thou shalt call me my father and thou shalt not turn away from me but notice in Mark Chapter 14 verse 36 the first time we find the two words put together Abba Peter my dear father my dear father the Lord Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him now the second Adam not in the Garden of Eden but in the Garden of Gethsemane the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and the Bible goes on to tell us that he feared Jesus feared death is a few hours away and his Humanity goes to feeling for the first time the closeness of death and how does he pray about Peter armor painter and he sweats and sweats until the capillaries in his bloodstream begin to break and are released out of the sweat glands in his body it must have been awful to have heard him if we could go there this morning for a few moments I can see him there in the Darkness his flesh is trembling and shaking he's down on his knees maybe kneeling on a rock great drops of sweat as it starts out under such arduous pain of prayer I don't know if you've ever been there before but I've been there a few times one time many years ago casting a devil out of a person and I prayed and I prayed some folks here with me that day and I prayed until my clothes were wet my socks my shoes praying that devil answering in an ultimal voice saying you will not make me leave I was in the Garden of Eden I have been here for a long time and the anointing would move in this place where I was with the Saints praying with me but the gym remembers that he was there and the presence what God would come in in such a mighty way and that devil would get so afraid and so scared and the individual would quake and tremble and shake and the anointing would move the psychic would hit against a block wall and it would back off and we would pray again and the anointing would move and it would back off this went on for several hours until finally the individual passed out and I told the companion their mate I said we're going to go home and rest for a bit I want you to call me when they wake up the person said is it gone I said no it's not gone she just under such exhaustion that he can't talk no more what did I need Abba Father my dear father we went back a few hours later the individual had come back around seemed different seemed different but you see a devil can come and go as he pleases until one was Authority adjours him in the name of Jesus and makes him leave he will not be able to come back again unless that body house will allow him to do so you see friends when we're talking about this sort of thing it's more than jumping more than running more than shouting for a devil to obey you you better know what you're doing Jesus is experiencing this fear as I walked into that place I don't know that I'll ever forget it as long as I live the individual was a small person real small and stature now walked into the door a man's voice spoke out of this person's body and said get it out of here see it wasn't me what was it the spirit adoption hmm oh boy they're nervous now ain't they uh-huh I wasn't just talking about you all either oh the work that God has for his church Hallelujah and he said Ava Peter all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not but I will but what thou will so Jesus is experiencing for the first time this human anxiety and turmoil and fear you imagine his Humanity been flooded with fear not just death but to become sin he prays to Father God the spirit which now dwells in him in the fullness because it knows it will be long it will leave him the father will leave a son spirit will go out of the humanity and the body must die alone no wonder he's saying Haba Peter Abba my dear father my dear sir please don't leave me don't leave me now maybe some of you think you can live without the Lord Jesus in your life I'm going to tell you one thing I wouldn't want to live with him for 30 without him for 30 seconds in this world as mad as I've made hell it would be bad any child of God sitting here today that's filled with the Holy Ghost you ought to feel the same way I wouldn't want to live one minute without Jesus Christ in my life when you think about it when you're facing such things as I've described to you this morning and you've heard me tell it before when I was in Michigan many years ago preaching and I was awakened in the pastor's house and I was in the bed there and I heard a noise and it was the headboard bumping against the wall and the bed was moving and I woke up and I looked at the end of that bed there stood a creature veiled in a Black Veil and his head was like back in the veil like this and I could see his eyes and he spoke out in an audible voice and said took his finger like this and his finger was crooked and he said I've come to take your life and when he said it his legs bumped against the bed again and the headboard hit the wall brother Donna she felt like shouting you got to be kidding me I was scared to death I didn't take my eyes off of him but I raised up in the bed I took my hands and raised up in the bed upon the pill and I said Satan in the name of Jesus I rebuke you Step Closer again hit the bed I sat in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you go back to hell where you come from and I watched him as he stood back and he backed out and backed out the room I was in was like a bonus room over a garage and there was a window there at the end of it and he backed out and disappeared into that wounded she felt like shouting you got to be kidding me I sweating bullets sweat pouring out of my face sweating running out of my hands why it's a human reaction to experience fear when you encounter hell it's a human reaction to experience fear when the doctor says cancer when the doctor says TB when the doctor says you are incurable oh Hallelujah but if you can get yourself calm and the spirit of adoption can anoint you then you can move from the soul and it will capture imagination it will capture thoughts it will capture she takes feel smelly here and said let me do the talking then say from the soul can say I refuse to be controlled by fear as Carol and I pulled into the cancer center on Friday she said we never thought would ever be coming to this place did we I said no we sure didn't we walk in and sit down with our daughter Erica of course and we'll answer her husband that go through all the different tests and this and that and the other results of one thing and another nurse Center nurse practitioner then the doctor comes in now we're going to try this and we're going to do this now he says I cannot cure you there has no one ever been cured of what Erica has fear would say well you better get a funeral subject ready I have no funeral text I'm not planning a funeral come on Saints we ain't picking out no songs well you're picking out no burial clothes and the doctor said I cannot kill you and he did this raise both of his arms like this and his fingers up toward the heavens but God has the last say hahaha praise the Lord what do I say in those times what do you say forever father Hallelujah my father he realizes the end of a human life now remember Jesus will never live a human life again he's hours away from the end of human existence so he fears so he hesitates Immortal fear he could pray any way he wanted to Lord God I don't know Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Jehovah Our Redeemer Jehovah Our Savior Jehovah our Banner but instead of uh aha dear father you say whenever you're going through things like this and you can still call him dear wonderful sweet you don't realize what a victory he's been able to work in your life instead of getting an attitude God uh-huh you see that's what Satan was able to convince Eve of in the Garden of Eden yea has God said notice in Genesis 1 God did this God God until Genesis 2 whenever God brought family into the Earth and then the Bible adds to that Lord God Jehovah with his family and what was Satan able to do bring Eve back to their pre-existence name yea hath God said impersonal uncaring That Couldn't bother her at all but she took the bait and then she starts saying the same thing well God did say this and God did say that so when you're in the midst of your trials don't let go of ABBA what was Jesus doing the same thing that Isaac did my father I trust you I trust you second Corinthians 6 18 and I will be your father and you will be my sons and daughters says the Lord Almighty Romans 8 16 the spirit is cell bearish witness with our spirit that we are the children of God second Timothy 1 7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear the spirit is of fear is not your human reaction to a tragedy a trauma or something that is frightening it is a demon that hangs around you and causes things which should be able to pass within a matter of seconds or minutes but instead it is like if we could see it in the fourth dimension it would be like a dark cloud it's a being and it hangs over you and it makes everything that is fearful makes it that much worse God has not given us the spirit of fear but of this is a Greek word dunamis which is where we get our word Dynamite from of power and of love and of a sound mind first John 4 18 There Is No Love No Fear in love and the church said there is no fear and love but perfect love cast us out fear because fear has that means experienced it I tell you right now in the name of Jesus if you'll believe some of you believe this service today set free thank you Lord God let's jump over here brother skip a couple of scriptures trying to jump to Israel in the church how close yours is momentarily this has been the greatest thing that I've found among Christian people throughout the entire world has been a fear they're always afraid when a little sickness strikes they're afraid many I wonder sometimes and now I'm along with you but now what I'm trying to do tonight and this week to come is to try to drive that fear away by God's word again it says one of the greatest courses on the church today is fear one of the greatest curses so who put it on us who put it on us don't you notice he's not saying Sinners and lost and the people the infidels and agnostics and so on but on the church again he says in the next one the greatest thing that I find against the church tonight is fear Everybody's scared to death about something what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy Carefree just stop these fellas singing up here in the brother testifying back there just free so it must have been some folks of her singing and they were singing like this free and he was using them as a comparison says see that's the way all the rest y'all ought to be y'all ought to be free like them people are singing oh my Carefree there ain't nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah skip over a little bit brother several quotes sir let's go down to some of those
