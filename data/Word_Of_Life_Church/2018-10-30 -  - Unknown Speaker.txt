praise God we'd like to speak to you here tonight if God before us if God be for us verse 9 it says and it came to pass as Moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the Lord talked with Moses and all the people saw the cloudy pillar staying at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayeth unto me bring up this people and thou has not let and now has not let me know whom thou will sin with me yet thou has said I know thee by name and thou has also found grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if it's a big word if I have found grace in thy sight show me now the way that I may know thee that I may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give the rest and he said unto him if that presence go not with me carry us up not up hints for wherein shall it be known here that I on thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou has found grace in my sight and I know thee by name and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God for the reading of your word tonight for the assembling Lord of your people in this building Lord for every individual life that's here today Lord that would be touched by this sermon Lord we pray father you would remove any hindrances Lord whoever this sermon was inspired for for I believe that your word comes on the heart of a yielded vessel Lord specifically to meet the need of an individual need Lord so we pray God for whatever life would be affected tonight whatever you for ordained Lord for the words that you that you'll speak Lord through me I pray you'd remove every hindrance out of the way Lord may your word find its bedding ground tonight Lord may you be with us Lord in the service Lord and give us the unction of the Holy Spirit we pray father we pray you'd bless Lord brother Donny as he's away ministering Lord I pray for the meetings there all the people that are gathered Lord your bride worldwide may you receive the glory Lord we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated tonight this is a awesome Scripture as we know coming what led up to this point is Moses being anointed of God to lead God's family out of bondage and they come through all the red sea and we don't want to get into the story of that here tonight but we just have something amen the Lord placed upon our heart and we see that Moses comes to this place and he's gonna be anointed of God we find him anointed of God there on the mountain when he tells Moses take off your shoes for the ground wherewith you're standing is holy ground now this holy ground can place that God was referring to we know it wasn't a specific spot a four-by-four square of of earth or dirt that God said was holy but Moses God was speaking of a condition that Moses his life had came to that Moses had came to a spot of holy ground and now the Lord was going to Commission him to deliver God's people and and and Moses brings them all the way through the Red Sea and then God is going to have this conversation with Moses because he wants him to go forward we pick it up here and look in your Bible please if you have a Bible here tonight would you dust that thing off and use it here and not depend on technology but if they have it on the screen I want you to put it for those that didn't have it amen but we love our Bible amen think we should read it amen I think it should be something there's something about hearing the the turning of pages amen the rustling of the leaves for a preacher Amen so Exodus 33 just keep your Bible there turn in verse 9 and let's pick it up here where he comes and he's going to have this conversation in verse 12 and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayeth unto me bring up this people and now has not let me know whom that will sin with me yet thou has said I know thee by name and thou has also found grace in my sight notice what Moses is go to say says now therefore I pray thee if I have found grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may know thee that I may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people Moses is saying to the Lord that what I believe what you've said about me you you've said that I found grace in your sight you've said that I that I'm on holy ground you you've said that you've ordained me and and commissioned me and and Lord I'm here to tell you today I believe your word I confess your word I believe what your word has said about me but God can you give me that revelation that you have about me you see it's one thing to confess what the Word of God says about you it's another thing to believe your confession are you here tonight friends it's one thing to say Lord I believe your word and what you've said and you said that I'll be an overcomer and God I can say amen to that I'll be an overcomer it's another thing for that revelation to drop in your heart to where you can say I am an overcomer I am what the word says about me I am going to be in his image not just because he said it but his word is real to me personally Moses was saying Lord if I found grace in your sight personally I let me know Lord that I have found grace in thy sight Lord what you're saying about me but reveal it to me God reveal it so that I notice how Moses said this so that I may find grace in your side Moses knew that finding grace and the sight of God was more than just hearing about the acts of God it was more than just hearing a sermon it was more than even seeing the acts of God but Moses said Lord I want to not just know your acts are here about your works I want to know your ways personally Lord and Bible says that to Israel that that God had shown his acts but to Moses he shows his ways he shows his glory and Moses knew that finding grace and the sight of God was a personal experience to the individual it wasn't just a confession that Moses could have he had to experience it personally Moses was saying Lord this is something that I've got to know not just what you know about me Lord you know many things about me you know me from the inside out but I want to know to have confidence to go forward another day another step I've got to know personally that I found grace in thy sight I want it to be a personal presence notice verse 4 and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give you rest what an awesome thing to have the rest of God and only with the presence do you get the rest apart from his presence you don't get the rest you can have the books you can have the tapes you can play them from the morning until the evening and still lack the rest of God in your soul you can come to church come in here sermon after sermon and still lack the rest of God you can have this Bible you can have this church you can have good people you can have good music you could have good songs but only in his presence do you receive the rest of Almighty God and it's not an asura nor in a Bible but it's in the presence of Jesus Christ and I say tonight Lord I don't just want your word I don't just want a Bible I don't just want a sermon I don't just want to tape Lord I want your presence because in your presence Lord I can have rest for every day that I live I can have rest in the midst of trial I can have rest in the midst of the storm if I can find your presence I know everything's gonna be just alright oh I want to know that I found grace in your sight Moses was a man who was convinced that without the presence of the Living God in his life it was useless to attempt anything notice this he had the Word of God and what the word said about him I want you to make sure you catch this in the scripture Moses had the word you say well all you need is the word all you need is a promise from God not according to Moses Moses said I have your promise and I believe that promise but I want to let you know God I'm not going I'm not leaving I'm not going anywhere I'm not going unless I have not just your word but your presence which means your person which means you not just your gift but you you can have the gift of the Holy Ghost and not how you can have a gift from the Holy Ghost but not the Holy Ghost himself and Moses says I want I don't know swamp the gift I don't just want the promise Lord I want you notice what he says in verse 15 if thy presence go not with me carry us up not hence God says my presence will go with you Moses I'm Oh God God God says look Moses here's what here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna send my presence with you Moses says that sounds good Oh God if that sounds good but here let me promise you something if you don't go I'm not going you notice what the determination of brother Moses Wisconsin I'm gonna go with you you found grace in my sight my presence will go before you and Moses said that's a good thing God because if it don't go I want you to know I'm not leaving I'm not going I've come to a place in my life that unless I know that I know that I know that you're with me I can't go another day I can't go forward I can't go and make any progress Lord I've got to oh you're there and you'll never leave me and you'll never forsake me and your abiding presence is with me before I go forward Lord because without your presence it is nothing more than a man-made attempt at serving God and I say to you today that unless your Christianity has the presence of Jesus Christ in it then your Christian life is nothing more than a man-made attempt at being good unless your life has the presence of God in it unless my life is backed up by a living God I have nothing more than a dress code a rule book of do's and don'ts and a lot of self-help book on how to be a better person how about how to how about how to influence people and how to how to live a good clean life oh but my brother I don't want that just here tonight I want my life not just to be a life of what I do and what I don't do I want it to be a breathing a God who breathes upon my life a literal reality that I hold within my soul if your presence isn't with me every day of my life then Lord it's not worth it it doesn't matter the ups or the downs it doesn't matter the highs are the lows let the presence of God abide with me always look at first verse 15 again and he said unto him with thy presence going out with me carry us up not hints he was saying Lord if your presence is not with me I'm not going anywhere I won't take another single step unless I have an assurance we need to get to that place with the Lord but I believe some of us need to get to that place with the Lord just say Lord you want me to go forward but I ain't going forward unless you're with me oh it was a desperation for Moses it was like Jacob who could say I'm not leaving until you bless me I'm no I'm different until I know I've been changed oh I can hear about it I can confess it I can read your word and what it says but Jacob said I've got to know I've been changed I'm different I'm not the person I used to be I'm not leaving until you bless me Lord always the song says I won't be denied I'm gonna get my blessing and if I have to stay here you'll find my bones at this altar but I'm gonna receive my blessing from the Lord because I can't live without him I can't serve or walk this Christian life without him I can't go forward unless you go with me Moses says don't even carry us up if your presence is not with me don't even send me for we're in notice verse 16 for wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have fell notice what he's saying in this conversation for wearing or how shall it be known that that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight you say that we found grace Lord and you spoke to me face to face you've revealed that to me personally but how will anybody else know is it not or isn't this how they will know that you're gonna go with us so shall we be separated I am thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth notice what the notice what Moses is saying here in verse 16 he says a wherein shall it be known that I and that people have found grace is it not that thou goest with us so shall we be separated I and that people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth you know what Moses is doing Moses is literally quoting the word that God had said about him back to him did you catch that this isn't Moses his words Moses is it isn't bragging saying well I want to be separate I want to be different I want to be above all the other than nations of the earth I want to be peculiar Moses didn't say that Moses is literally quoting the word that God had spoken about him back to him and Moses is saying Lord this is what you said I'm only repeating what you've said it wasn't me ah you're the one who put who called me Lord it wasn't me who called me o my brother and my sister sometimes we need to quote the word back to God and say Lord it wasn't me who sought you you sold me it wasn't me who found you you found me Lord I didn't put this desire inside of my heart you put it there I didn't call me to this race you called me Oh hallelujah I didn't come to this church because I wanted to you called me here Lord and Moses is quoting what God said about him back to him to say Lord you're the one who said it not me you're the one who found me you're the one who changed me you're the one who saved me you're the one who filled me I didn't put a desire in my heart to serve you you put it there so Lord I'm saying here tonight come and finish what you started Lord come and finish the work that you started in my life I'm not here because I chose to be here you called me Oh God Oh does anybody feel that way from a burning desire down in the heart do you feel that way tonight just say Lord yearn that the Bible says you're not just the author you're also the finisher of my faith hallelujah the same one who who pulls they in a race do you realize that the Bible says that Jesus is not just the person who fires the trigger who pulls pulls the trigger and the gun to start the race he's also the one at the finish line waiting to receive you when you finish your race Oh hallelujah match my poll said lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset you and run the race with patience oh you're the one who separated me you're the one who called me I'm not the one who put a desire in my heart to serve you you put it there Lord even beyond my explanation I should be a million other places than in church beyond my own explanation or beyond my own understanding Lord you called me now make me what you said I was going to be you know there's nothing wrong with saying that to the Lord God make me what you said I would be and the Lord said unto Moses verse 17 I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou has found grace in my sight and I know thee by name the first time God said that wasn't good enough for Moses the second time notice the first time God says it Moses I'm calling you I want you to go and lead this people and I've called you I know thee by name you found grace in my sight but Moses wasn't convinced yet so he says that again were Lord I understand what you're saying but if I have found grace in your sight then show me your way O God God says okay Moses my presence will go with you O Lord I know your presence but Lord if it doesn't go then they don't even sin this Lord how will anyone know but Moses you found grace and my sight Moses my presence I know Lord you said that what was it it sounds like Moses isn't convinced of what the word says about him sounds a lot like me and it sounds a lot like you and he's questioning and questioning my lord I know you said this and God says Moses you found grace him I said but Lord how will anyone know if you don't go with us is it is it not that you go where with us what was that it was a picture of a man who was very aware of his own mistakes it was a man who was very aware of his own humanity and he knew there's nothing good within me I've looked and peered into the deepest part of my of my person and I'm there's nothing good lord I want you to understand are you sure you're gonna go because if it's up to me this is that this is going to be a disaster and you know what the Bible says God doesn't say God doesn't say Moses my goodness how many times do I have to tell you it could have been the first time God to say shoo go away Moses just get out of here you ain't gonna believe the word I already told you three times my oh you found grace in my son if you still can't believe by now I guess it's just hopeless for you no but the Bible says what this guy do he just keeps reiterating the word he just keeps telling him again and what does he do with you and me my brother and my sister he preaches another sermon and says I do love you and you say Lord but I don't know if you love me but I do love you Oh Lord I don't know if I'm gonna make it you're gonna make it and what does he do when you lose faith he tells you again and they told you again and it tells you again and sermon after sermon service after service God is it giving up what's he doing he's pouring his word into our heart to dispel all of our doubt and fears I'm so glad I'm so glad God doesn't kick Moses to the side and say well I guess it's just you ain't gonna ever believe our you know God keep saying it you have found grace in my sight and I do know thee by name and what do we do the very next week oh I just don't even know I don't even know look at me look at I'm such a mess and you come to church and a sermons preached and you have faith and you grab a hold and you believe the Word of God only to go out the next weekend and you're deaf down and back to scourge and back to Preston am I ever gonna make it what does God do he just comes the next Wednesday and tells you again and then you go out from that service and oh I don't know if God loves me I'm not sure if I'm even born again and what does God do does he kick you to the side and say just forget it you'll never make it no he comes the next Sunday and tells you you're an overcomer you're gonna make it you're gonna be in a rapture God does love you he keeps pouring into the heart of Moses to let him know this has nothing to do with you Moses this is the work of God oh we should give him praise and thanksgiving for that here tonight but you don't give up who me look you just keep pouring your word you have found grace I do know thee by name and if you're doubting what the Word of God says about you my brother and my sister that's okay God understands God is fully aware of what doubt and fear is God is fully sympathetic to the doubter you may be a doubter here tonight that doesn't mean that God doesn't love you what did what did he do after Thomas says the report comes back to Thomas and says Thomas you know there behold he's risen he oh yeah here he rose his body's not there and the Bible says Thomas after all of everybody else and the rest of the church to say praise God he's recent Thomas is standing over there there's arms curls going I don't know I just don't know I've got to have physical proof and he goes further and says unless I touch his hands I won't believe now does the Bible say God when jesus walks in that room he hugs Peter and he hugs he hugs all of his is his disciples and then he looks over at Thomas what are you doing here you doubter you unbeliever how dare you question how dare you have fears and doubts is that what God does to the doubter no he walks over to Thomas it's just Thomas here's my hands go ahead go ahead Thomas touch him Thomas touches his hands what's he doing what's he doing he's sympathetic to the man who doubts [Applause] what's God gonna do he's gonna reveal himself to you he says Moses I do love you I do know you by name I've called you I've ordained you I've anointed you and whether you feel called you are called and whether you feel ordained you are ordained whether you feel anointed or not does it have anything to do with the fact that you are anointed oh my brother and my sister let me read let me let me quote to you the words of your pastor heard him in Florence South Carolina preaching in a meeting he said when are we gonna realize that when you're called to be the bride of Jesus Christ you are anointed whether you feel anointed or not you are anointed to fight the devil you are anointed to overcome you are anointed to keep going you are anointed to get back up and it doesn't matter how you feel about it tonight it's what God's Word has said about you hallelujah I say it doesn't matter what I feel like it doesn't matter what I look like it doesn't matter what I think about myself when I look at myself all that matters is that he put a desire in my heart to serve Him that's why I'm here he put her desire in my heart to believe in a rapture that's why I believe in and it doesn't matter how I get from here to there he'll perform the word which he has spoken regardless of what I feel like verse 17 and the Lord said unto Moses notice in your Bible the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing that thou has spoken for thou has found grace in my sight and I know thee by nay you say what in the world what was wrong with Moses my goodness man why do you have so much trouble you gotta ask and argue and I'm surprised God didn't just get irritated you and tell you to go away why why I don't understand what's wrong with Moses his face why couldn't with his faith why couldn't he just accept the Word of God why does he have to go around and around and around because Moses understood something that a lot of message believers need to understand he knew that the only thing that made him any different than any other person in the world it was not his stature it was not his intellect it wasn't his last name it wasn't the church he went to it wasn't his ability Moses knew that the only thing that made him different and the only thing that set him apart from any old person I don't care who it is any even any man from any other country any other nation any other tribe Moses was very honest in who he was in his natural state he was just a rotten failure like everybody else and the reason Moses contains and goes around and around and around and around is that the only reason that he was different than anybody is that God was for him that was it he knew that the only thing that separated him and made him any different than anybody else was the presence of God that was him that was the only difference and let me tell you something my brother and my sister there's not I don't care what you think about yourself and how high and lofty your opinion is of yourself and your church and what you believe there is not much that separates you from any body else and the rest of the world there's only one thing that makes us different than any other church and I promise you it's not our programs it's not our preachers it's not the ability or the charisma of our pastors or our preachers because there's much more charismatic much more gifted much more eloquent men who speak in churches then do our preachers in the message I'm sorry if that bust your bubble or offends you there's only one or two there's very little things that separate us from any other church or any other Christian in the world and it's not our music it's not our culture it's not our programs it's not our skits it's not anything it's strictly that the presence of Jesus Christ has smiled upon us and said I told you I chose you I selected you it wasn't because of anything good within yourself the only thing that separates our churches is the presence of God can move into our sanctuary and go from seat to seat the seat to seat to see the problem problem problem problem discerning discerning discerning discerning that means that if we lose the presence of God in our churches we are no different than anybody else the only thing Moses knew that makes me different is that the presence of God the shout of the king is in our camp brother Branham said it this way he said the presence the ever presence of the Living God is the lifeline of the church that means that if you lose the presence of God in your life or in your church or in your family you have lost everything you have lost everything what are you left with Moses knows if you slice it all down you dice it all down you cut it all down you remove all the facade what do I have I'm just a dirt diver who's running from Pharaoh I'm living out here in a tent I ain't got nothing nobody's got no money we ain't got good education we don't have good a good army we don't have any weapons we have Saul's and shovels and picks and axes were farmers so brother branham's said they were they were just dirt daubers we try to make ourselves special and intellectual and and I'm great and grant listens you me my brother my sister the elected of God is not some special people because of their human a life on earth or their career or their intellect or their ability or are their talent the only thing that makes them special is that God shines down upon them and his presence is Whitefield that's the only thing that makes them different so what am i doing today I am contending to say I refuse to trade the presence of God for any program or any beauty or any outward glory or any music or any great talent I refuse to trade the presence of God for anything I say God let your presence go with me every day of my life don't leave me Lord because when you tell when you tear it all down there's nothing different it's nothing different what do you have yeah a good dress code that's good good people interesting doctrines really interesting listen to me friend I'm sorry if that offends you here tonight what do you have if you take away the presence of God out of the message if you take away the living presence of Jesus Christ that he's the same yesterday today and forever what do you have you have good hunting stories have good people good friends good churches hey pretty good music man if I must say so myself but really what makes us any different than any body else Moses says there's only one thing the Lord are you sure you're going I'm going are you sure you're with me I'm with you are you sure you know me I know you by name are you sure we found grace in your sight at Moses you found grace what was it Moses same Lord because I'm nothing special I just want to warn you I'm nothing special unless you're going this is gonna be a disaster but Moses could say but if God is for us then who can be against us if God as far as nothing can stop us no weapon formed against you shall prosper if the presence of Jesus Christ is fair Oh give him a handclaps of praise hallelujah Moses could say I don't care how other nations are ran I don't care how other nations get their guidance I don't care how they form their strategies before they go into war I don't care how their governments are conducted or how their rulers conduct themselves or how they conduct their armies maybe that's good for them I don't care how you run your church there's only one principle that we abide by in this church and in this army and that's the presence of God living with us abiding with us I don't care how the rest of the world is Rand I don't care Moses could say I don't care how they bow they build their armies or their strategies we have one strategy in our army and it's not great generals with great war plans that desire to devise I promise you it's not a great chariot Simoes because you could say cuz we don't have any we don't have any Spears that we can count on we don't have any any chariots we can put confidence in when we go to war we don't have some great a million man army we're a small group of people with shovels and picks and axes we're not even trained fighters Moses could say but we do have a secret weapon [Applause] we do have a secret weapon we have a weapon of mass destruction and his name is Jehovah and as long as he's with us nothing will stand before us I said as long as he's with us we may not have armies we may may not have chariots we don't come and with armies and with soldiers and with spears and shields but David said I come to you in the name of the Lord for the name of the Lord is a high tower that a strong tower that the righteous can run into and be safe [Applause] Moses could say lordy if you don't go if your presence is not there look around what do we have we have no way to defend ourselves we have no army we could fall back on we have no intellect we can fall back on Lord if you're not there if your presence is not there then you can take that Tabernacle you could take all the curtains all the beads all the bells all the whistles all the furniture the candlesticks the showbread you could take all of it tear it all down because it means nothing unless the fire of God dwells and the presence of God is there Oh's that you say you could take all of it down you could take all of our doctrines all of our fancy cliches because without the presence of Jesus Christ without the presence of the Living God or helpless were reduced to nothing we're actually worse off than a denominational believer I'll just preach this from down here behind this pulpit that way if y'all decide to throw something at me you take the presence of Jesus Christ out of this message you're worse off than a denominational Christian who sometimes has better morals sometimes sometimes physically from the outside can do more service than you can live more of service has more of a servant's heart some of the greatest people are independent Baptists people with it with great servant's heart wanting to build orphanages and and wanting to build hospitals say oh that ain't what Jesus taught us to do but that's what Jesus called them to do yeah that's what he called them to do I said we would be worse off if you take away the presence of God the shout of the king the anointing of God you have nothing let me go a little further you're worse off than a sinner sitting on a barstool Luke chapter 15 turn there for get myself into trouble Luke chapter 15 let's look at this here Luke 15 turn there in your Bible you love the Lord I [Applause] want you to look at this here in Luke 15 verse 11 you got it's a min and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them was living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had spit all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in one and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks of the swine that the swine did he and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare and I perish with hunger I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and AM no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy servants good plan sounds real theological real principle you know I've messed up I took my father's inheritance I squandered it I know what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna go back I'm not gonna dare ask to be a son again I'm just gonna say I have it better off as a server in your house I have it better off than I do living with pigs and he would have and he says and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him hold on you don't know what you're doing now you gotta hold on just a minute now what he says he says father I've sinned against heaven and in thy sight and him no more worthy notices his father's trying to hug him and it breaks him he's saying I'm not even worthy to be called your son look at verse 22 I'm not even worthy to be coach ton but the father said to his servants notice he doesn't even respond to his son he doesn't try to convince him he doesn't preach to him he just says the Bible says but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be happy joyful shouting singing dancing praising jumping shouty they began to be merry what was it here this man had ruined his inheritance had when it lost everything that he had received as a little boy and he says I'm not even worthy to be called my mind my father's son I am gonna go back and I'm gonna I'm gonna just be his servant I'm just gonna I'm just gonna live I ain't escort's and I'm just gonna serve you know this is the mentality of so many Christians after we've messed up and ruin our chances and and we've made big mistakes and some of us have made some big mistakes in our life can we be honest here tonight some of us have made some huge mistakes and some really really bad choices some of us had almost went to the point of no return and some of us have almost lost everything but somehow grace somehow grace oh I'm so thankful today that I know grace I know Amazing Grace how sweet the sound some of us have so messed up and you could say oh I don't I can't even explain it you know how I explained it but god that's how I explained it but God I was messed up I ruined everything I was living in sin I had no chance but God who was rich in mercy I'm so glad he wasn't just rich in material things but he was rich in mercy and the Bible says the Sun starts coming home notice he's took his first steps I don't know what that first step may be for you here tonight when your heart starts to turn back to God you may be in a messed up condition lost everything think you're not worthy to even come to church let alone to be called a son of God I don't know what what you what your condition is here tonight but I know this boy who had squandered everything the Bible says as he started making his journey home no doubt all of these thoughts were going through his mind what am I gonna say what if he rejects me what if he would have well you know what if I'm not even allowed into his gates what if I'm not even allowed back a church what will everybody say what would everybody be thinking well well what were the people whisper about with a pastor even had me back well he allowed me even to come back to the church I know what I'll do I'll just how I'll be as I'll be a servant I can all sleep the I'll sweep I'll mow the grass and maybe I'll earn my way back into a seat in the church again you know what the Bible says the father did the Bible says the father brother Brennan says that father stood on the porch every day and look for that boy to come and the Bible says it this way it says when he seeing his son from afar notice he didn't wait for him to come up through the door all the way down through the altar get on his knees repent of his sins he didn't stand overtopping to him and listen and when he's repented of that and what he did wrong there when he now I'm gonna watch him when he goes and makes that ride and that right and that right and that right and that right I'm gonna sit here and wait and watch it when he's came to sanctification when he's really filled with the Holy Ghost maybe after two or three missionary trips after he puts this much in the offering then maybe I'll come in and I maybe I'll shake his hand and start off the relationship slowly though the Bible says that when the father seen him when he was still a long way from perfect when he was still a long way off when he was still messed up and with mistakes and full of failures that the Bible says the father started running to him and he made him in the middle hallelujah and God didn't wait for you to get perfect the Bible says his love was shown to us that while we were still sinners father runs to this boy Oh dad but you don't you don't understand it's okay it's okay my son who is dead he was lost and he's found the Bible says they begin to be merry what happened a party had started a feast a celebration kill the fatted calf oh and they begin to shout and they begin to dance however they do and they were they were rejoicing they were enjoying the joy of the Father they were basking in his presence they were they were feeling I think they they were they were enjoying the presence of the Father the Bible says they were making merry uh-oh verse 25 now his elder son was in the field and he hears the music what in the world I have never heard our church shout like that what in the world he hears it in the field he can hear the organ he could hear the piano hear the guitar hear the drums what's happening up there Bible says he's in the field I've never heard music like this and as he came and he drew nigh to the house as he got closer he heard music and someone say it and dancing he heard music and dancing verse 26 and he called one of the servants notice he asked one of the Deacons hey come outside here for a moment before I go in there let me just check things out here he call one of the service and asked what in the world is going on what what what do these things mean I don't even know what they mean I've never heard music like this I've never heard dancing in the dry never heard shout I've never heard plays I've never heard I've never been in this way I've never heard this or experienced this and he said unto Hume that brother verse 27 that brother another one who was lost the one who was in the world the one who everyone had given up and written off he's come and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and sound and he was happy and he rejoiced and he said I'm gonna get in there shot with him no the Bible says he was angry now notice let's get to the cause of his anger and would not even go to church that's how upset he was I'm not even gonna go in there for came his father out well thank the Lord and entreated him verse 29 verse 29 and he answered and said to his father notice what is going to say to his father whoa ah these many years do I serve thee and he said Thor's father lo these many years do I serve thee neither transgress I at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gave us me a kid in other words you never you never slew a lamb for me thou never gave us me a kid that I might make merry with my friends jealousy but as soon as this sorry lowdown sinner brother of mine what's he doing notice remember what I said you're in a worse condition without the Holy Ghost you are in a worse condition sitting with religious do's and don'ts I don't do this and I don't do that and I don't do this you know what the Word of God does to a person it cleans them that's what baptism is supposed to do it's supposed to clean you justification it cleans you but let me tell you one of the most dangerous things for a person to be in it's cleaned but empty and this was a man who was clean of the world but empty of the presence of God he was cleaned but he was empty and Jesus said the Bible says that that man is in a horrible condition he'd been better off that he stayed dirty because what happens to the person who comes the sanctification and comes to all the rules and all the do's and all the don'ts that's what they become they become I do and I don't Christian I don't do this and I don't do this and I don't smoke and I don't drink and I don't Rico and I don't wear bats I don't wear shorts and I don't cut my hair and I don't I don't some cigarettes I listen to this I listen I listen to this you become I don't I don't I don't but what do you do I know what you don't do what do you do a person who Jesus said it this way says because what happens is when that house is cleaned and empty seven other spirits the Spirit comes back to the man finding it clean and sanctified and bring seven more spirits and the man's condition is worse than before he was clean you say why because oftentimes those seven other spirits that come back to make that man worse is not drugs and alcohol because they already came from that they got clean from that most of the time those other spirits is religious spirits and they become like this man I sat in church all these years I never broke the commandment I never turned from you I stayed at your side the entire time I was in church every Sunday every Wednesday 30 minutes early paid 10% and often paid 10% in ties I did everything you asked me to do I never smoked I never drank I never cussed on her and I never did this I never did this but there was no joy there was no love there was no happiness there was no pleasure in God and there was no pleasure in sin you see they live in the middle they're miserable man I don't know how I got on this here tonight I wasn't planning on it but as soon as this thy son was come with just devoured thy living with harlots and his killed you've killed for him the fatted calf I said all these years in church and I never transgressed I never did anything wrong yet you never turned up the music for me there was never no joy there was never no shouting like this there was never no party thrown for me notice what the father says to him in verse 31 and he said unto Him son thou art ever with me in other words you're at church every service you're always here and all that I have is that notice verse 32 it was meat that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead in his alive and was lost and found in other words your your your joy was always here but you never took advantage of it the Holy Ghost was not given to make you miserable it was given to make you happy it was given to give you the fullness of joy and some Christians are the most miserable people on the planet Earth because there's no joy in sin and there's no joy in the Lord I know that may choke you but the Bible says sin is pleasurable for a season so the younger brother and the who we went in didn't went to the world had pleasure in sin and now he's going to get pleasure in God and and he's going to rejoice and he's going to dance and this made that brother so upset and the father says it was available to you at all times you could have shouted at any time you could have asked for the Holy Ghost to feel you you could have asked for the Father to share his shed his love upon you it was there the whole time oh my brother my sister you don't have to beg a real believer to worship God you don't have to prod them and beg them raise your hands put your hands down sing to God I forgot a real believer brother Brigham senses its bubbling from the inside it's wanting to get out what are they doing they're enjoying their salvation they are taking joy in their salvation not misery Curtis said this way you don't have to beg an alcoholic to get drunk you don't you don't have to beg a druggie to take his drug it's what he wants to do because that's what gives him happy simulation and a high you don't have to beg him that alcoholic will let his marriage go he'll destroy let his job be destroyed his driving record he'll give everything to that alcohol just to get another drink he is sold out to his God he is sold out to his drug why that's all the happiness he's got that's what's been given to him in his life to make him happy so he takes advantage of it let me tell you something believers this is what God has given you are we sold out Christians are are we not you shouldn't have to be beg to praise God you should say I'm gonna take advantage of my salvation I'm gonna be happy in the Lord I'm gonna praise II with my voice and with my hands it's all I've got hallelujah that's what Moses was saying without that reality you have do's and dont's legalism if just do's and don'ts and do's and don'ts Moses says when you put it all together unless you go Lord all the other nations may trust in their armies but we don't have any weapons we have sticks we have farming tools we live in tents what was Moses saying Lord I'm nothing without you well can you say that here tonight said Lord when you slice it all down I'm just nothing without you you mean everything to me hard your presence with me in my home and in my family with my children when I'm at work when in my my car when I'm when I'm at church all I want to bring that presence with me how does the presence of God come into the church it's not by a song leader like brother Louie getting up here and singing it's not my piano player playing music that's not what brings it what brings it is use you bring the presence of God with you when you come to church and when that happens no one has to beg the preacher doesn't have to labor a song leader doesn't have to labor the musician stone we are caught up in a heavenly atmosphere hallelujah notice this in Abraham's life brother the power point if you go to that first slide God was so in the prayer in this man's life look at just some of these men and the Old Testament this is a man by the name of Abraham who you know very well notice what it says here and you could go to the next slide my brother it says then it came to pass notice this and it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and fie call the chief captain of the whole of his hosts spoke unto Abraham saying notice this is a heathen this is an unbeliever God is with you in all that thou doest this was not a believer this was not an Israelite this was a heathen man who didn't know God yet even the heathen had to testify there's something different about Abraham let me tell you something my brother when you go to work your associates you should not have to tell them that you're a Christian they should know it about if we are who we confess and say that we are it shouldn't have to be told to us teenagers your friends at school should not be shocked to learn that you're a Christian they should know by the evidence fruit that's in your life there's something different about that person there's something different about her there's something different about him everyone should be able to notice what does the Bible say in the book of Acts they were first called Christians at Antioch it doesn't say they first called themselves Christians at Antioch they were labeled Christians they didn't label themselves the rest of the world said you're Christians which means you're like Christ we shouldn't have to label ourselves Christians the rest of the world should label us and say that's a Christian next why brother noticed this man named Joshua God had promised to Joshua no enemy could stand against Joshua as long as the presence of God was with him notice there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life here's why why because you're so good-looking Joshua because you were so tall so strong man what you're my goodness you're just so intellectually so smart no because as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage Joshua because when God's Spirit is present with you you can be strong you can be courageous because nothing shall stand before you all the days of your life why because of Joshua no because here was the secret as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee look at this man Gideon Lord told Gideon now mighty notice the mighty man of Valor now notice before this I had no record of Gideon fighting any battles winning any battles slaying any Philistine killing any kind of Goliath there's no record that Gideon had any victory in his life to label him or call him a mighty man a mighty man of Valor but notice what the word says it says and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto Him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor notice the order that he says this in he doesn't say thou mighty man of Valor the Lord is with thee but he says the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor what made Gideon a mighty man of Valor brother Terry the Lord is with thee it wasn't anything Gideon did it was the fact that God was with him it's what made him who he was and go in this thy might do you know what is referring to in the next verse thy might is this verse what might am I gonna go what might are you gonna go with Gideon your intellect know your strength know your battle record no you ain't got one your weapon no don't have one just grinding you know we by the by that by that by the threshold notice what happens God says go in this time i Gideon could say what is my might go in that revelation don't go with any looking at yourself or what you can do or what you can do how many mistakes you make your records of wins and losses here's the strength I'm gonna give you to fight the enemy with I will fight your battles I will go before you I am with thee God tells Jeremiah that the whole nation on the next slide the whole nation would turn against you and reject your prophecies though you're on fire and you're in your bones is shut up the fire of God Jeremiah are going to be a mighty prophet of God but own nations are gonna hate you don't he even tells Jeremiah at one place don't even look at their faces when you preach because they're gonna be so angry and their face is gonna have such hatred for you God says Jeremiah the whole nation I will make unto thee this he says and I will make thee unto this people a fenced brazen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee here's why Jeremiah because you're smart you had a degree in theology because of your records of wins and losses because of how intellectual you are because of how much your obedience is Jeremiah you're so obedient man everyone else's obedience is here but your obedience is in the stratosphere Jeremiah you always listen you do everything I say no for I am with thee to save the end to deliver thee saith the Lord God says Jeremiah this entire nation can reject you when I was your family may turn against you your mama and your daddy may turn against you call you a cold call you a cult follower a brand might your entire family may hate you and despise you but don't fear I am with you all the days of your life to save you and deliver you saith the Lord God tells Isaiah of a special promise he makes of those who love him he says fear not notice what he says when thou passes through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire through the fire through the fire you mean I'm going to have to walk through the fire through the flood I'm gonna have to go through the flood jesus said in this world you will have tribulation you will have to go through the fire you will have to come through the flood but here's the promise I'm making you you'll go through every fire and I'll be with you you can go through the flood when the presence of God is with you it doesn't matter how hast the trial it doesn't matter how fierce the storm it doesn't matter how high the flood is you'll make it and you'll survive and overcome because I'm with you [Applause] all these men what separated them from every other man God is with you the only thing that separated the Ministry of William Branham a brother Branham was one thing he promised him the ever never felling presence of Jesus Christ will be with you and nothing will stand in your way because you're so intellectual you have such a great education you came from suffered prominent family you have such a good family and background and raising no he was the very opposite he was the very opposite no intellect no family no talent no ability to speak well I will it mean that he was gonna be the greatest preacher no but the never presence never fell in presence of Jesus Christ that was the only thing that separated him from other men who could speak better than him from Billy Graham and Oral Roberts who can have larger meetings and larger tension and have a larger entertainment and it could be more entertaining and speak better and speak more powerful the only difference that separated them from brother Branham was that when he spoke God backed up what he said the never felling presence of Jesus Christ will be with we're gonna close turn to second Chronicles gonna have 10 more minutes really is that okay just a few more minutes second chronicles chapter 14 I want to finish this amen second chronicles turn in your Bible you can you can kill that brother this is a man who we know you've heard about him I'm sure of ASA under the prophet Azariah says in 2nd chronicles chapter 14 it details this victory this great victory that ace is going to have over the Ethiopians ASA who has no army to speak of very few men untrained soldiers untrained warriors is going to go and have a great victory over a million Ethiopians a million of them and he's gonna have this grey mighty victory over this insurmountable army and what seemed unlikely and against all odds ASA comes out on the other side victorious we pick it up here in second chronicles 14 verse 11 and ASA cried unto the Lord is God and said Lord it is nothing with thee now this is before he fights the Ethiopians this is his prayer and ASA cried unto the Lord his God and said Lord it is nothing with me to help another words Lord and he it's nothing for you to help and we're in a bad situation here Lord all you've got to do is stretch forth your hand whether with many or with vim that half have no power he was speaking of himself help us O Lord our God you know when you say those words it moves God's heart help us help help that's a that's a powerful word you say that in public somewhere just the words help can silence and stop chaotic crowds and commotion you could be in the middle of an airport where people are going everywhere in every which way but let a person scream out for help one time and it paralyzes the atmosphere how much more does it paralyze heaven when a son or daughter of God cries and says help me Oh ASA said help me hard for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude O Lord thou art our God let no man prevail against the so the Lord smote the Ethiopians before ASA and before Judah and the Ethiopians fled what was it God in aces time of help moved and came on the scene now leading up to this historical victory was not a history of Israel that was very bright leading up to aces time as King was very dark was very bad horrible Kings Israel had sinned and had others worshiping other gods and other idols in their churches they were by no means a name that was worthy to be called children of God yet they still were even through their sin in their unbelief what did the Bible say God would rebuke them and chasten them his anger would be kindled against them but he never gave up on them he never turned his back on film he never forgot them you say why wouldn't he just forget them God gives us that answer can a mother forget her suckling baby how much more can I not forget you Israel though you've sinned though you've been in debauchery and in all kinds of evil I can't forget Israel she's inscribed on my heart forever an ace is going to come as a king they were not deserving of the help of the Lord that's why ASA prays the prayer that he prays yet they come with victory notice here of chapter chapter 15 the very next chapter of the first verse and the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded and he went out to meet ASA and he said unto him hear ye me ASA now this is a prophet and he's not coming at the time to rebuke he's not coming at the time of defeat or depression this is a time of rejoicing in victory ASA has just conquered a million Ethiopians with a very small army ezreal shouting there and ASA says hear me as Rice's hear me ASA and all Judah and Benjamin the Lord is with thee and that's a powerful thing the Lord is with thee but read the very next part while you be with him he said for the night we have the presence of God hallelujah pretty Scott the presence of God is with us in our churches in our life in the message we have the presence of God as long as you're with ASA the Lord is with thee Joshua asked for the presence of the Lord and he got it Moses asked for the presence of the Lord and they got it Jeremiah asked Isaiah ass and they got it and you have asked for the presence of God and you've received it notice what he says the Lord is with thee while you be with him and if you seek him he will be found but if you forsake him he will forsake you now for a long season notice how the word is used for a long season Israel had been without the true God and without a teaching priest and without law but when they in their trouble this is still the words of Azariah the prophet trying to get a sand I understand ASA you were in need you were in trouble but but I want you to remember ASA it was just a one chapter before chapter 14 and you were worshiping bail serving Ashraf you had gods you were wicked you were vile come on ASA be real here for just a moment everything looks rosy right now you're calling on me right now but don't forget ASA it was just last month you were in a bar sitting on a barstool just it wasn't too long ago where was your prayer life but you were still coming to church but you know good and well inside of your heart you were cold and more lost and far away from God than you've ever been you know that you were spiritually stagnant and still had no prayer life had no family altar devar or any kind of relationship with God and his church or around his people you were still there you still had the law you still had all the precepts all the all the articles you were still called the children of God but you know in your heart ASA for a long season of your life you were without God is that what it says verse 3 now for long season has ever been without the true God verse 4 but when they in their trouble did turn to the Lord God of Israel and salt him he was you spent a long time sinning you spent a long time far away from God but when you turn to God God didn't stand there and say no huh sorry you were you were three years on the run I'm gonna take three years and make you grovel and hurt and complain you you know good and well in your heart you were you were you were three months four three months you never thought of me you never talked to me you never spoke to me you never prayed you never at whispered you never said my name you were ashamed of me you know your heart was further away from me than it's ever been and because of that I'm gonna make you grovel and suffer aren't you so glad that ain't how god does it aren't you so glad that that's how we are that's not how God is you take a person who's ever rejected you or betrayed you betrayed your test some of us can never give them in any place in our life again who betray us it's like a person who never wants anything to do with you hate your guts talks badly about you despises you but suddenly you become rich and and then you're popular and everybody likes you then suddenly who wants to be your best friend suddenly you get something and they'll come around oh yeah hey how you doing but hey how's it going long time no see yet you spent years you never liked me you hated me you despised me you rejected me this is what Israel did to God you spent years you didn't want anything to do with me and at the very moment you get in trouble who do you come running to I'll just be honest ounds a lot like me distressing calamity comes was the first thing we do fall on our knees and some of us the very first thing we have to say is Lord I'm so sorry but I need you right now and the Bible says ASA you spent a long time away from me yet Israel didn't want anything to do with me but I want you to remember that at the very moment they called my name just like that how long did it take me after you spent years running from me but at the very moment you turned your heart and begin to seek me I immediately embraced you I immediately came on the scene it didn't take me six months it didn't take me six days I came at your beckoning call and delivered you because you sought me o my brother my sister the song says he was there all the time waiting patiently in line in line behind who in line behind all your other interest all your other hobbies all your other ambitions all your other desires behind your career behind your wants behind your desires he was just waiting his turn in line he never walked away and at the moment I called his name I found him I'm so thankful that the moment I turned to God he turned to me ASA when you were in trouble you called and salt him he was found but I want you to remember something you want the presence of God in your life you want the presence of God in your family how many wanted here tonight you want the presence of God in your home and your children and your teenagers in your church at your job in your life with your health with your money with your wants with your wishes you want God in everything and God says well good God is with you as long as you're with him jesus said abide in me and I will abide in you but as long as you're not abiding in me don't wonder why I ain't abiding in you and as long as you're not with me don't wonder why I'm not with you I thought God was supposed to be here for me thought he's supposed to fault my I thought God was God's versus goddess listen to this what about you what about what about you what about me ASA as long as you are with me I'm with you I want to be with God I want him to be with me you say how do I abide with him read your Bible turn on a tape of the prophet of God get down on your knees and pray one time I know that was really deep and I'll say it again if I have to I know it was real theological

to church I know it's hard to believe we have to say that in the 20 minutes in the day and age we live in but we do come to church not just on Sundays not just on Wednesdays come to church be in the house of God it's what we're supposed to do I won't strength I won't vitality I want to be refreshed I want to be on fire for the fire of God and how do I get there abide in me and I will abide in you I say God I want to stay with you I want to abide with you I don't want you to leave me or forsake me I want to be with God because I want God to be with me oh can we say that here today say Lord I want you to be with me every moment of my life stand to your feet oh give the Lord a hand clap of praise here - oh give him a real praise from their heart blessed be your name Oh God blessed be your name Lord Jesus when they were in their trouble they did turn to the Lord God of Israel and sought him and he was found ASA remember you were seeking me and as long as you seek me here's the promise I'll make I'll be found I'm so glad that when I seek and in a game of trying to find him and looking everywhere and looking at God says at the very moment you cry there I am you know the Bible says it says that that rock and the wilderness followed them it's not what it says in the New Testament said that rock was Christ and that where that rock followed them followed them means it didn't matter where they went it still followed doesn't matter what sin they went into it still followed doesn't matter what the wrong decision they made it still followed oh my brother don't we realize he said I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you till the ends of the world I want that for my life well how many fathers can raise up a hand and say I want that for my family how many mothers could say I want that for my children I want the ever never-failing presence of Jesus Christ to go with me play something for me brother I wanted to go with me in my job on Monday I wanted to go with me through the trials in the test of life I want to know that God's there at all times he can be contacted at all times I don't have to spin hours and hours and hours and you said brother Matt how do I get back to fellowship how do I get back to Communion how do I get back to relationship oh he's he's right there all the time he was there all the time I find that in my own life it doesn't matter how far I go and how how stagnant or stale or cold I can get say brother Matt you can get cold stagnant stale can you if I could be honest can you can you can you get distant get far get cold but I'm so glad military I don't have to spend weeks and months and begging and pleading groveling porn putting ashes all over me and all the Lord I'm so sorry oh god will you we could just speak to me again oh I find that no matter how long it's been that I've been away from God it only takes just me whispering his name and he says yes yes child what do you need what can I do for you the Bible says let us therefore come boldly boldly into the presence into the throne approach him with boldness that we may what find grace to help the time of need how many needs do you have here tonight how many needs do you have here tonight let's say Lord I'm coming to you here boldly Lord as I know how to be knowing Lord that I won't be turned away it's not based on my merit or my works or my performance Lord
