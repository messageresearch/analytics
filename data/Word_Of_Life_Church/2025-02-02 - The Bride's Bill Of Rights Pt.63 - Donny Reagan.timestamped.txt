[43:01] wonderful facing a situation like
[43:04] our brothers and sisters are facing with
[43:07] sister Shirley's passing it certainly
[43:10] comes with mixed
[43:12] emotions we're not here today to of
[43:16] course sorrow for her because as Paul
[43:18] said we sorrow not as others who have no
[43:20] hope for if we believe that Jesus died
[43:23] and rose again them which also sleep in
[43:25] Jesus will God bring with him when he
[43:29] comes but the sad part about is is that
[43:32] big old hole right in your heart that
[43:36] nobody else in the world can ever be
[43:39] able to feel so we certainly want to
[43:41] remember brother Bill and the family and
[43:44] the church family as well service
[43:47] tomorrow evening and then Barrel on
[43:49] Tuesday and and then when everybody goes
[43:52] back home brother bill has to go back
[43:54] home by himself the SI siblings have to
[43:57] go back in their directions and try to
[44:00] find a new
[44:02] normaly just because we say our goodbyes
[44:05] and extend our condolences while while
[44:07] it's going on we certainly don't need to
[44:10] stop praying then do we no amen but
[44:13] we're longing for the
[44:15] day when the last
[44:18] Saint will pass
[44:20] away when the you know what sister sh's
[44:23] funeral might be the last one we'll ever
[44:25] have but if it ain't
[44:27] it's coming when death will be swallowed
[44:31] up in Victory hallelujah thank God Amen
[44:35] we certainly welcome to be with us here
[44:36] today and uh let's let's just continue
[44:40] to pray for him if you would let's turn
[44:42] to Second Peter today if you would
[44:43] chapter 1 verse
[44:45] two we greet you today in the name of
[44:47] the Lord Jesus what an honor it is forc
[44:50] to be gathered to GA in the house of the
[44:52] Lord and so appreciate the presence of
[44:56] God grateful that he's a help to us in
[44:58] the time of need amen second Peter 1
[45:02] verse 2 as we read these words today I
[45:06] want you to keep in mind that they were
[45:09] pinned by a man that was identified as
[45:14] ignorant and
[45:17] unlearned the Lord must have got a hold
[45:19] to this old boy didn't he I sit back
[45:22] there reading these words before I came
[45:24] out and I thought wow how astounding
[45:27] Grace and peace be
[45:30] multiplied unto you through the
[45:33] knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[45:38] lord according as his divine
[45:42] power hath given unto us all things that
[45:47] pertain unto
[45:49] life and godliness amen through the
[45:53] knowledge of him that has called us
[45:57] to
[45:58] glory and
[46:00] virtue this is what we're called to now
[46:03] we're not just called to come to church
[46:04] we're not just called to say well I'm a
[46:06] Christian but we're called unto glory
[46:10] and
[46:11] virtue whereby are given unto us
[46:13] exceeding great and precious
[46:16] promises that by these ye might be
[46:20] partakers of the divine nature not
[46:25] Natures as imp plural but nature
[46:30] singular having escaped the corruption
[46:34] that is in the world through
[46:37] lust and beside this giving all
[46:40] diligence add to your faith virtue to
[46:45] Virtue knowledge let me read Janelle
[46:49] what this word add means the English
[46:52] translators chose this word they
[46:55] certainly didn't choose the word that
[46:56] would be the most U that would explode
[47:00] the full meaning of what Peter wrote in
[47:03] the Greek here notice the word that he
[47:05] uses for add as we would think well we
[47:08] add this to this and this to that and
[47:11] that to that but that's not the word
[47:14] that Peter used the word that he used
[47:17] was for add is
[47:20] Minister
[47:22] nourishment to
[47:24] supply furnish ministered unto and
[47:29] assisted so now listen what you do is
[47:32] giving all diligence so you
[47:35] assist to your faith or minister to your
[47:39] faith virtue actually in the Greek it
[47:42] says in the possession of your face
[47:46] Minister virtue look at it again now
[47:49] verse five and beside this giving all
[47:51] diligence add or minister to your face
[47:57] virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to
[48:01] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[48:03] patience and to patience godliness and
[48:06] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[48:09] brotherly kindness charity so it's like
[48:13] once each of these virtues are
[48:16] assumed it becomes the stepping stone
[48:20] for the next virtue so you come from
[48:24] Faith then it opens up into virtue then
[48:27] from virtue into Knowledge from
[48:29] knowledge into Temperance so once you've
[48:31] achieved faith it becomes a ministering
[48:34] Channel and the latter in turn actually
[48:38] qualifies and completes the former so
[48:43] add to your faith virtue so then it
[48:46] completes faith and then it ministers
[48:50] into the next Channel now remember there
[48:53] ain't nothing that you and I can do to
[48:54] add any of these ourselves it takes the
[48:56] Lord to do it and then Faith which is
[49:00] the one on the very bottom faith is the
[49:02] foundation of this all and it leads to
[49:05] the
[49:06] capping of divine Love on
[49:10] Top
[49:11] Capstone being love and me like to be
[49:15] remembered today as we pray God bless
[49:17] each of you Heavenly Father we have
[49:20] gathered here today Lord with
[49:22] Thanksgiving in our hearts and we're
[49:24] just so grateful that we could want once
[49:27] once again on this side of Eternity be
[49:29] gathered in the house of God you see our
[49:32] needs that they are many Lord we've got
[49:35] those that are sick that couldn't be
[49:36] here today we've got different needs
[49:39] some carrying a heavy burden brother
[49:42] Bill and their family Lord just with
[49:45] sadness and yet it's it's a mixed
[49:47] emotion they're so happy for our sister
[49:50] Shirley no more suffering and by now
[49:53] she's already crossed the river and met
[49:56] all them loved ones that she's been
[49:59] longing to see for so
[50:01] long stepped into a brand new body no
[50:06] more sickness no more pain no more
[50:08] heartache I'm sure her and Erica has
[50:11] already had a spell together on the
[50:13] other
[50:14] side different ones that you sent down
[50:16] to the river to be able to meet her Lord
[50:20] God our desire is that we can be
[50:22] faithful so we can be gathered together
[50:25] with them on that great
[50:27] today help us Lord and we believe that
[50:29] you've given to us from your word the
[50:32] things that are necessary to complete
[50:35] this building of the House of the Living
[50:37] God speak to us today from your word and
[50:40] show us those things that we have need
[50:43] of we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:46] amen God bless you you may be
[50:54] seated truly I I think that we as the
[50:57] people of
[50:59] God as we are living in the closing
[51:03] hours of the Gentiles
[51:05] history we can see all around us the
[51:09] politics religion governments of the
[51:13] world none of them can produce the
[51:16] answers that people are searching for a
[51:20] politici will arise and people will
[51:23] rally around him and their hopes are so
[51:26] high and what he's going to do and then
[51:29] he'll fail here and he'll fail there and
[51:32] fail somewhere else and they become
[51:34] disappointed
[51:36] disgruntled they go looking for another
[51:38] one to replace him they find a a church
[51:42] and they saying oh my oh my I I have
[51:44] arrived this this is it everybody there
[51:47] is so awesome and this church and this
[51:51] preacher and oh it's so wonderful and
[51:55] then the more they know him the more
[51:56] realize nope everybody ain't there ain't
[52:00] perfect
[52:01] yet and so what do they do they go
[52:04] looking for another one look for another
[52:06] preacher look for another church look
[52:07] for another something that'll satisfy
[52:11] but myself I was thinking about it
[52:13] yesterday as I was contemplating and
[52:15] praying about the service today that I
[52:18] don't think there's any Holy Ghost fill
[52:20] child of God on the face of the Earth no
[52:23] matter what what race they are what cont
[52:26] of the earth they are what nation they
[52:28] live in what nationality that they're
[52:31] from that will ever be totally
[52:34] completely satisfied in this life
[52:39] because there's nothing here that can
[52:41] ever meet that complete satisfaction but
[52:44] the Lord Jesus himself and you know that
[52:47] as well because you achieve something in
[52:49] your life you work and try to Arise at a
[52:52] certain place and once you get there it
[52:54] didn't produce what you thought it would
[52:56] and then you you set for another goal
[52:58] and you reach for that and say well I
[53:00] made it I got here I finished this this
[53:02] studies and I got this degree and I got
[53:05] that and you think I thought it would do
[53:07] more for me than that and there's
[53:08] nothing here that'll ever be able to
[53:11] satisfy that inside the soul but God has
[53:14] given us a preview of what really that
[53:18] we're longing for and that is that each
[53:20] of us can come to the spot that if we go
[53:24] by the way of the Grave whenever it
[53:26] start and moving in into sister
[53:28] Shirley's room where she was the other
[53:30] day that she don't have to scream and
[53:33] cry and say get death away from me I'm
[53:36] not ready to go but she can be able to
[53:38] meet man's greatest enemy and life at
[53:42] him and and know that God is her
[53:45] conqueror and her Victory you know it's
[53:47] quite a sing when a child of God Can
[53:49] Face death I've been by the bedside of
[53:51] many people and watched them die I've
[53:54] never seen one saint of God not one I've
[53:58] never seen one of all the decades that
[54:00] I've been by them that have screamed
[54:04] pray for me pray for me get me out of
[54:06] hell pull me out of the flames of fire
[54:09] never not one time I've never seen one
[54:11] Holy Ghost feel sa even though prior to
[54:15] entering into the channel of death they
[54:17] might had a little bit of Suspicion and
[54:20] a little bit of liness going into it but
[54:22] I've never seen one and I've stood there
[54:24] and held the hands of many of them and
[54:26] stand there by their mothers and fathers
[54:29] or wives or husbands and whatever more
[54:31] and then watch a smile come on their
[54:33] face or watch something of presence
[54:36] enter into the room or as it was with
[54:39] our sister Brown as she looked beyond
[54:41] the curtain of time and looked across in
[54:43] her last one of her last words to be
[54:46] said out of mortal lips
[54:50] wow oh wow not oh God have mercy I'm
[54:55] lost no a saying of God is just changing
[54:58] dimensions that's what they're dealing
[55:00] with so God is obligated to give us away
[55:04] by which we can be able to leave this
[55:06] world with old Wows on our lips instead
[55:10] of God have mercy I'm lost aren't you
[55:13] glad for that today now God anointed
[55:17] Peter to write about this 2,000 years
[55:19] ago and we've looked at it of course for
[55:21] years and years but it's evident Friends
[55:23] by the time and the season that we're in
[55:26] that many of us are still looking and
[55:28] longing and we have a Necessities in our
[55:31] life when we read these things and we
[55:34] hear the prophet talk about it that we
[55:36] need to move up a little higher how many
[55:39] can say Amen to that today that at times
[55:41] when our faith can be so tried and then
[55:44] our virtue and our knowledge and we're
[55:46] not talking about Earthly knowledge now
[55:49] it's not even theological knowledge of
[55:51] the word but it's a Godly knowledge
[55:53] which is totally different you can Ram
[55:56] your head full of message quotes and of
[55:59] scriptural quotes and you can know the
[56:01] Greek and the Aramaic and all that sort
[56:03] of thing but what good does it do if you
[56:05] don't know how to use that word when
[56:07] you're in the midst of such a storm so
[56:10] Godly knowledge is the knowledge that'll
[56:12] give you the ability to pull the right
[56:15] portion of the word at exactly the right
[56:18] moment when you need it which is a
[56:21] different than just human Earthly
[56:23] knowledge now I want you to think that
[56:25] God could have chosen all the different
[56:28] ways to be able to get his people to a
[56:31] place to where they'd be able to attain
[56:33] to this he could have chose Angels he
[56:35] could have wrote the Gospel on the stars
[56:37] and you and I would have went out on
[56:39] clear nights and would have looked up at
[56:41] the stars and we' read the Bible right
[56:43] there and the stars and Donnie don't do
[56:45] this and Fred don't do that and then
[56:47] Carol do this and the Stars what a hell
[56:50] the story and God could have chose
[56:52] something that would have been without
[56:54] flaw the stars have have maintained
[56:56] their place since the Lord God created
[56:59] them when the heavens were made but yet
[57:01] God shows something so frail and
[57:05] something so full of mistake human
[57:09] beings that would be flawed and yet God
[57:12] chose to call them and give them a gift
[57:16] and place them and what God called was
[57:19] the
[57:21] ministry now I was sitting thinking
[57:23] about it yesterday I so you know what I
[57:26] trust my wife to something as flawed and
[57:30] as faulty as preachers are now no matter
[57:34] how long they've been preaching how full
[57:36] of the Holy Ghost they are there's not a
[57:39] preacher on the Earth today and never
[57:41] has been except for Jesus himself that
[57:45] is free from faults free from
[57:48] shortcomings and they have failur and
[57:50] they have to Lord I'm sorry and they
[57:53] have to even at times get up and say hey
[57:55] Saints I'm so sorry I I misquoted that
[57:58] the other day and I I I didn't mean to
[58:00] or I I said this and I I app it in the
[58:03] wrong way and I'm real sorry and you
[58:05] think God would commit the greatest
[58:08] accomplishment that he's ever going to
[58:11] do outside of the death's burial and
[58:13] resurrection of our Lord Jesus into the
[58:16] hands of flawed faulty men and yet God
[58:21] knew exactly that every one of them
[58:23] preachers would be flawed from their
[58:26] births up they themselves as they're
[58:29] preaching and that's something maybe you
[58:31] don't realize that when a preacher is
[58:33] preaching he's not only preaching it to
[58:35] you but that word is going right in on
[58:37] him and it's cutting him and it's
[58:40] trimming him and it's helping him to get
[58:43] lined up as well so the same word that
[58:46] he's preaching many times is going to
[58:48] him first and the truth of it is
[58:50] sometimes he's already repented while he
[58:53] was sitting our studying before he walks
[58:54] up here and preaches it to you so God
[58:57] committed then this delivery of all the
[59:01] things that would be needed and we know
[59:03] that to God a message is such an
[59:05] important thing so this is why we value
[59:08] the word of God the Bible and the
[59:11] message of the hour that's been given to
[59:13] us let's turn and read if you would in
[59:15] Ephesians 4:1 and let's look for a
[59:18] little bit before we go into these
[59:20] virtues on the ministry of Jesus Christ
[59:23] now remember ever God called man
[59:26] if they're really called of God and
[59:28] gifted by God they have and given to
[59:31] them a portion of the ministry of the
[59:35] Lord Jesus so we say well it's brother
[59:37] Bill's Ministry it's brother Joel
[59:39] Brown's Ministry brother John brother
[59:41] Donnie and in one way I can see where
[59:43] we're coming from but in reality the
[59:46] ministry if if it's come from God is the
[59:49] ministry of Jesus Christ and the Saints
[59:52] said and he gave some Apostles and some
[59:55] prophets some evangelists and some
[59:57] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[1:00:00] of the Saints for the work of the
[1:00:02] ministry singular now he mentioned five
[1:00:05] folds of one Ministry but then when he
[1:00:08] come down to identifying it as a
[1:00:11] Ministry he doesn't make it plural the
[1:00:13] way he makes it plural when it comes to
[1:00:15] the offices so the offices are plural
[1:00:19] but there's only one Ministry now we
[1:00:20] know every man that gets in the pull pit
[1:00:23] and preaches is not even called of God
[1:00:25] in the first place
[1:00:26] you can tell that by the way they handle
[1:00:28] the word for the perfecting of the
[1:00:30] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:00:33] the edifying of the body of Christ so
[1:00:37] every godall preacher is given to be
[1:00:40] able to edify the body it's not to build
[1:00:43] him up it's not to lift him up it's not
[1:00:46] so that people will make a superhero out
[1:00:48] of him but actually that man is given a
[1:00:51] gift from God to be able to edify the
[1:00:55] body as a matter of fact once he
[1:00:56] receives that call and he goes to moving
[1:00:59] in that cycle God wants it to be the
[1:01:01] rest of his entire life while he's
[1:01:03] living on the earth he will be a servant
[1:01:06] to God's people is that right so he will
[1:01:10] edify so he will spend his time his life
[1:01:13] his mind his his wake hours thinking of
[1:01:17] what he can do to have how to help and
[1:01:20] benefit the people of God it's not about
[1:01:23] what can the people do for me and it's
[1:01:25] not about well how can I excel and how
[1:01:27] can I become greater you see a gift in a
[1:01:29] part of the ministry is not the same
[1:01:31] thing as being a building contractor
[1:01:33] it's not the same thing as being a
[1:01:35] certified electrician it's not the same
[1:01:37] thing as many of you that are setting to
[1:01:39] be this and that and the other and you
[1:01:41] want to keep climbing higher and higher
[1:01:43] and higher until you get to a spot to
[1:01:45] where you reach a certain pce scale and
[1:01:47] you succeed to become this and that and
[1:01:50] the other in line that's not the way it
[1:01:51] is with a godall man and they are just
[1:01:53] men only because that is what the Bible
[1:01:56] says so what they want to do they spend
[1:01:59] their whole life and giving to the Lord
[1:02:01] and they really don't even know
[1:02:02] theirself what they will wind up being
[1:02:05] they don't even know when they start out
[1:02:07] what the end of the goal will be they
[1:02:10] don't even know God calls them to be a
[1:02:12] part of the ministry they don't even
[1:02:13] know which part of the five-fold they'll
[1:02:15] be God don't give you the option okay I
[1:02:18] want you to be a preacher which one do
[1:02:20] you want God don't even ask you that he
[1:02:22] don't even ask if you want to be called
[1:02:25] he don't even ask if you want to go he
[1:02:27] don't even ask you if you want to do it
[1:02:29] or not he just says you're going to do
[1:02:31] it so you really don't have a choice so
[1:02:34] then once God begins to pull you into
[1:02:36] that cycle then you change who you are
[1:02:39] you change what you are your family
[1:02:41] around you your wife your children
[1:02:43] everything there begins to change in
[1:02:45] that direction and you get that
[1:02:47] identification now this is what Paul
[1:02:49] when he wrote about it the purpose of
[1:02:51] the ministry was till we all come in the
[1:02:54] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[1:02:56] of the Son of God so again it's not the
[1:02:59] knowledge of the preacher it's not the
[1:03:01] knowledge of how big the church is how
[1:03:03] much money do they have how many members
[1:03:06] do they have but it's the knowledge of
[1:03:08] the Son of God so apparently there's
[1:03:10] more to the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:03:12] than just knowing he come to the Earth
[1:03:14] to die for Sinners he raised from the
[1:03:16] dead ascended up on high he's our high
[1:03:19] priest because if that's so then the
[1:03:21] preacher ini isue tell us tells you that
[1:03:23] in John 3:16 and there's nothing else to
[1:03:26] know unless of course we're talking
[1:03:29] about a knowledge which is nosis now
[1:03:31] remember the Greeks looked at knowledge
[1:03:34] as just something that you constantly
[1:03:36] increased and it might make you a better
[1:03:39] person but it might not so that was
[1:03:42] nosis that was the word they Ed so your
[1:03:44] knowledge might puff you up which is
[1:03:46] what Paul talked about but the way the
[1:03:48] Jews looked at knowledge was that real
[1:03:51] Divine knowledge was something that you
[1:03:54] did learn and you accumulated in your
[1:03:57] mind but that knowledge if it was divine
[1:04:00] knowledge it actually changed you and it
[1:04:03] made you a better person more into the
[1:04:06] image of what God wanted you to be
[1:04:08] that's the kind of knowledge I want now
[1:04:11] watch Paul said unto a perfect man again
[1:04:15] singular not plural so the image then is
[1:04:19] not even the church A's Messengers in
[1:04:21] the day that God would raise up a church
[1:04:24] A's messenger than the people under that
[1:04:26] Ministry would be called to look like
[1:04:29] that messenger or be like that messenger
[1:04:32] no there's only one perfect man and that
[1:04:35] is nobody's Church age messenger that is
[1:04:37] nobody's Pastor nobody's favorite
[1:04:40] evangelist there's only one perfect man
[1:04:43] and that's the Lord Jesus and the church
[1:04:45] said so there is a perfect man unto the
[1:04:50] measure of the stature so again I spoke
[1:04:53] to you about it last week that God took
[1:04:55] his Divine measuring tape and he
[1:04:57] measured the image of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:00] which was projected by prophecy so he'll
[1:05:03] be a lamb he'll be a conqueror he'll be
[1:05:05] a lion he'll be a king he'll be a
[1:05:07] servant but all of them must be in
[1:05:09] divine order which is where the Jews got
[1:05:11] it all messed up they looking for a
[1:05:13] mighty conqueror to come first but God
[1:05:16] haded in the right order the baby
[1:05:18] preceded the mighty conquer so it
[1:05:20] totally confused them to understand what
[1:05:23] God was doing so God then me measured
[1:05:26] the stature of a perfect man and as far
[1:05:28] as humanly he was a little guy maybe 120
[1:05:32] lbs 5T something the Lord Jesus I'm
[1:05:34] talking about a little man small in
[1:05:37] frame and the prophet saw him several
[1:05:38] times in visions and visitations he was
[1:05:41] not a great big man I always found that
[1:05:44] to be amazing to me that when he saw the
[1:05:46] angel of God he would talk about you
[1:05:49] know being a larger man but when he saw
[1:05:51] the Lord Jesus he was a smaller man now
[1:05:54] most of us that think God God would
[1:05:56] always be bigger than his angels because
[1:05:58] it's the way that we understand
[1:06:00] greatness and big but that's not the way
[1:06:03] God looks at it so you imagine that here
[1:06:05] a bigger man walks up when he's there in
[1:06:08] Green Mill in the cave and yet when he
[1:06:10] sees the Lord Jesus standing right ABR
[1:06:12] The Sage Brush field he sees a smaller
[1:06:15] man than the angel of God that's a big
[1:06:18] man right there now what so God measured
[1:06:21] this perfect man so what did he measure
[1:06:23] him by well there was sign there was
[1:06:26] wonders there was Supernatural all that
[1:06:28] was inclusive of course but he also
[1:06:30] measured character he measured brotherly
[1:06:34] kindness he measured Faith he measured
[1:06:37] virtue so God uses this Divine measuring
[1:06:40] tape and then Peter catches it which I
[1:06:43] find it amazing that Peter wasn't even
[1:06:46] the church age messenger and yet Paul
[1:06:48] never mentioned these
[1:06:51] virtues Paul never mentioned them
[1:06:53] together in a group in the way that
[1:06:56] Peter did and yet whenever it come right
[1:06:59] down to it Peter there was things that
[1:07:01] he wrote and he said there was things
[1:07:03] that Paul wrote about that he said was
[1:07:05] many times hard to be understood and yet
[1:07:08] God chose Peter as the one to be able to
[1:07:11] pin this part down about the virtues now
[1:07:14] if you're listening to it of course in
[1:07:16] stue of a perfect man Blasphemous names
[1:07:18] also in ordination which is also again
[1:07:20] in 1962 and then he mentions it again a
[1:07:23] little bit on down while begin organized
[1:07:26] religion so it's a scope a span of time
[1:07:28] of about four weeks three or four weeks
[1:07:30] something there that he'll refer back to
[1:07:32] it now something if you're listen to
[1:07:34] that let me just make known to you that
[1:07:35] whenever you're listening to that cycle
[1:07:37] it's a cycle in in the prophet's life to
[1:07:41] where that he's looking at the new birth
[1:07:43] maybe some of you have already called it
[1:07:45] if not after I mention you will of
[1:07:47] course that he he's looking at the new
[1:07:49] birth and at that time frame he thinks
[1:07:53] the new birth is when you first
[1:07:55] repent and give your heart to God so
[1:07:58] whenever he preaches the statue of her
[1:08:00] perfect man Blasphemous names the
[1:08:03] paragraph that he mentions in that night
[1:08:04] service ordination whenever you mention
[1:08:06] why I'm against organized religion he
[1:08:08] will lay out of where he's at on the new
[1:08:11] births so he says that the foundation of
[1:08:14] that and the new births he believed as a
[1:08:16] matter of fact you can go almost to the
[1:08:17] end of 62 and he said I thought I was
[1:08:20] the only one that believed us this way
[1:08:22] until I heard Charles Fuller this
[1:08:23] morning talk about it and he said that
[1:08:26] he believed that the new birth was being
[1:08:28] born again and then receiving the
[1:08:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost was for
[1:08:33] power come on but if you studied the
[1:08:36] message and you watch as that message
[1:08:38] kept unfolding the prophet realized
[1:08:41] you're not truly converted until you get
[1:08:43] the Holy Ghost amen you see this is one
[1:08:46] reason I can follow a man like this
[1:08:49] because he grew in his understanding and
[1:08:53] he was not afraid to let us know about
[1:08:55] can you and I do the same thing you see
[1:08:58] real true Christians can only speak what
[1:09:01] we know and we speak it with all of our
[1:09:03] heart but remember what was Revelation
[1:09:06] and 47 was Revelation and 65 and all God
[1:09:11] can do is keep adding to the Revelation
[1:09:14] and and you know give more information
[1:09:17] about it but it never changes But as God
[1:09:20] was revealing this to him so when you
[1:09:22] listen to this and then you say oh my
[1:09:24] goodness it sound sounds like that
[1:09:26] brother bam is saying that you don't get
[1:09:28] the Holy Ghost until you get all this
[1:09:30] here well I'm telling you one thing if
[1:09:32] you can get all these virtues without
[1:09:34] the Holy Ghost I'm not sure why you'd
[1:09:36] even need the Holy Ghost unless it's
[1:09:38] just to make you shout pretty good but
[1:09:40] realize where he's at when he's bringing
[1:09:43] it and then be able to go along and be
[1:09:46] able to progress in the Revelation I
[1:09:48] know a lot of message folks don't like
[1:09:50] to hear that but remember I'm called to
[1:09:52] tell you the Full Gospel I don't want to
[1:09:55] just slice a little here and a little
[1:09:57] there I want to be able to bring the
[1:09:59] Full Gospel y'all want that type of
[1:10:01] gospel preaching now watch so the
[1:10:03] stature of a perfect man is not a church
[1:10:06] aged messenger it is not a pastor but it
[1:10:09] is the Lord Jesus now notice what Paul
[1:10:12] in the contrast of what he projected to
[1:10:15] them about where they were now remember
[1:10:17] the Ephesian church is one of the deeper
[1:10:19] churches in the New Testament he could
[1:10:21] write to them about election
[1:10:22] predestination all kinds of great deep
[1:10:25] things never had to talk to them about
[1:10:26] gifts or nothing like that because they
[1:10:28] had it all in order but they were still
[1:10:31] immature in their knowledge of where
[1:10:34] they needed to be in the kingdom of God
[1:10:36] now watch how verse 14 contrasts that
[1:10:39] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:10:43] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:10:46] every wind of Doctrine so there were
[1:10:50] Believers here in the Ephesian church
[1:10:52] that were still being moved about and
[1:10:55] that'd follow this preacher and that
[1:10:57] preacher and that preacher it's always
[1:10:59] been that way and it'll be that way to
[1:11:00] the end time so Paul is telling them
[1:11:03] look this is why you need the ministry
[1:11:07] to be able to help you settle you down
[1:11:10] oh but you say brother Donny preachers
[1:11:12] are some of the main ones that cause all
[1:11:14] these things why of course they are
[1:11:17] whenever Satan looked at what God was
[1:11:19] doing Satan said that's a great idea
[1:11:23] what if God's got pastors I want me some
[1:11:27] God's got evangelists I want me some
[1:11:30] God's got teachers I want me some for
[1:11:33] everything that God chooses Satan has an
[1:11:37] impersonator or a copy which is off the
[1:11:40] word am well sure and he saw what God
[1:11:43] was going to do he didn't know this
[1:11:45] initial remember there was not teachers
[1:11:47] like this in the Old Testament there
[1:11:49] wasn't pastors like the New Testament
[1:11:51] had but Satan watched it and it took him
[1:11:54] a little b a little bit to see the
[1:11:56] pattern as it began to unfold and once
[1:11:58] he saw the pattern he started doing the
[1:12:00] same thing that's why Paul would write
[1:12:01] in the book of Corinthians and say that
[1:12:03] Satan can transform his ministers as
[1:12:06] Ministers of righteousness and Satan
[1:12:08] himself can appear as an angel of Light
[1:12:12] don't ever forget this Satan is the
[1:12:14] master of impersonation so he will
[1:12:18] impersonate like God he will impersonate
[1:12:21] like Angels he will have his preachers
[1:12:24] to impersonate as real Godly men and the
[1:12:28] church said that's right but now notice
[1:12:31] so and that doesn't do away with the
[1:12:33] real and the genuine so he says that we
[1:12:36] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[1:12:39] and fro and carried about with every
[1:12:41] wind of Doctrine by the slight of men
[1:12:45] notice slight of men cutting craftiness
[1:12:49] whereby they lie and wait to deceit well
[1:12:53] by this time of course Satan had already
[1:12:56] started using preachers so there was
[1:12:58] preachers that raised up and where do
[1:13:00] you figure they come out from under
[1:13:01] remember there were no Baptist Churches
[1:13:03] Methodist churches Church of God Church
[1:13:05] of Christ there were none of them by the
[1:13:07] time this was written around 55 ad there
[1:13:10] were no a Pentecostal churches there was
[1:13:12] no Nazarene churches so when you talked
[1:13:15] about a church there wasn't hardly any
[1:13:17] at all the original Church actually
[1:13:20] started on 33 ad and of course later on
[1:13:23] in the day there was some people that
[1:13:25] heard the message of Acts chapter 2: 38
[1:13:28] and they were added to the church but
[1:13:30] the Bible says nothing about them
[1:13:31] getting the Holy Ghost and the prophet
[1:13:33] tells us that that Spirit of antichrist
[1:13:35] started right there on the day of
[1:13:37] Pentecost just like the bride was born
[1:13:39] the bride got the Holy Ghost and them
[1:13:41] other folks just become members of a
[1:13:43] church so initially if you would if they
[1:13:46] would have had a church building there
[1:13:48] was only one original church so there
[1:13:50] was no Church of God Church of the
[1:13:52] Nazarene the first church the second
[1:13:54] Church the Third Church so if you saw a
[1:13:56] church that was only the original then
[1:13:59] before long there popped up another one
[1:14:01] on down the road and then another one
[1:14:03] you know in another country and another
[1:14:04] one here and another one there and what
[1:14:06] was Satan doing
[1:14:08] impersonating what God had done
[1:14:10] originally how you going to be able to
[1:14:12] tell them apart because the true spirit
[1:14:15] of God will always come back to the word
[1:14:17] and never deny one word at all amen is
[1:14:21] that right so by this time frame it it
[1:14:24] it would be hard for the Ephesian
[1:14:25] Christians today if they would be able
[1:14:27] to be transported into the year of 2025
[1:14:31] and they would have been coming to
[1:14:32] church here today or say going to
[1:14:34] brother bills wherever it would be that
[1:14:36] they would be going on a Sunday morning
[1:14:37] and they would have passed all the host
[1:14:39] of Baptist churches on their way to say
[1:14:42] here or wherever they were going
[1:14:44] Nazarene churches Church of God Assembly
[1:14:46] of God Church of God in Christ Church of
[1:14:48] Christ Catholic Lutheran Presbyterian
[1:14:51] and they would have passed all of these
[1:14:53] buildings with all these different signs
[1:14:55] and they would have drove by and looked
[1:14:56] at him think what in the world where did
[1:14:59] all these places come from where did all
[1:15:02] these come from in their day they never
[1:15:04] had to deal with that there was only
[1:15:06] just a few and then as it began to go
[1:15:09] along then the false Church began to
[1:15:12] explode and before you know it there's
[1:15:14] more of them than there was the bride
[1:15:17] and they out run then there become
[1:15:19] divisions then among the real bride move
[1:15:22] and then they started saying well I I'm
[1:15:24] a Paul and others say not me I'm of
[1:15:27] sephus which was Peter and I I'm of
[1:15:30] Apollos well now the splits started
[1:15:33] coming in around the message itself
[1:15:35] praise the Lord and then there was
[1:15:37] another group was said well I'm not a
[1:15:39] Paul and I'm not of Peter and I'm not of
[1:15:41] Apollos but I'm of Christ so in other
[1:15:44] words they didn't believe in going to
[1:15:46] church at all they didn't believe in
[1:15:48] even a Ministry because they just said
[1:15:50] I've got a direct contact to Christ and
[1:15:53] I don't even need no preacher at all
[1:15:55] well according to Ephesians 5 that was
[1:15:57] exactly out of the order of God praise
[1:16:01] the Lord now notice what he says in
[1:16:03] verse 15 but speaking the truth in love
[1:16:07] and as just mentioned to you last Sunday
[1:16:09] so it's totally possible that a preacher
[1:16:11] could preach the truth yet not do it
[1:16:14] with the right measure of Love is that
[1:16:17] right speaking the truth in love may
[1:16:20] grow up unto him look at this word in
[1:16:24] increase to become greater oh that's
[1:16:28] what we all want to be isn't it to be
[1:16:30] greater greater in the image of God not
[1:16:32] number-wise now I'm talking about in the
[1:16:33] image of God grow up into him in all
[1:16:38] things which is the head even Christ
[1:16:42] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:16:47] together now watch Paul takes the
[1:16:49] anatomy of a human body so you can
[1:16:52] imagine now if I would be able to remove
[1:16:55] this part of my arm from here down now
[1:16:57] why is it that my arm works so perfectly
[1:17:00] where it is now as I'm getting older and
[1:17:02] I'm getting a few more aches and pains
[1:17:04] sometimes it don't work so perfectly
[1:17:06] like it used to but God so designed it
[1:17:09] that my this part four part of my arm
[1:17:11] would be able to fit right here and the
[1:17:13] joint is made exactly where it needs to
[1:17:16] fit now what if I would say you know
[1:17:18] what I wonder if I would be better off
[1:17:21] to take from here down of my leg and
[1:17:23] stick it right up here here and I wonder
[1:17:26] if if I would be better wouldn't I be
[1:17:28] stronger in my arms if I did that it
[1:17:30] won't fit it won't work the joints don't
[1:17:33] line up so the ball on one part does not
[1:17:36] match the hollow on the other part and
[1:17:39] God knows exactly where to place each
[1:17:42] one of us so what if I would tape my
[1:17:44] little finger look at that little joint
[1:17:46] ain't that amazing ain't that awesome
[1:17:48] that God did that would it be really
[1:17:50] weird if our hands did this all the time
[1:17:52] would it be really strange if we never
[1:17:54] had no joints and nothing that would B
[1:17:56] but who did that our father it's the
[1:17:59] same way in the church and you realize
[1:18:01] God wants us not to compromise with sin
[1:18:04] but God wants us as the children of God
[1:18:06] to have the ability to bend every now
[1:18:09] and then and for the sake of peace and
[1:18:11] unity and so on and so on and the church
[1:18:14] said now watch the way Paul aligns this
[1:18:17] for whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:18:21] together fitly so in other words it fits
[1:18:25] so what if what if I would take this and
[1:18:28] and go to a surgeon tomorrow and say sir
[1:18:30] you know what I I've been thinking about
[1:18:31] it a lot and really I I think I would
[1:18:33] like to take from here down and put it
[1:18:35] right there and just have this wee wee
[1:18:38] tiny little for would that look really
[1:18:40] cool oh it wouldn't it look really
[1:18:42] deformed but why because it would not be
[1:18:45] fitly joined together now with
[1:18:47] everything they can do today they might
[1:18:49] be able to actually do it but I would be
[1:18:51] so strange I would look so bizarre and
[1:18:54] so deformed because I would be why
[1:18:57] because God never intended for that
[1:18:59] joint to fit right there well you know
[1:19:01] when you find your place in Christ Jesus
[1:19:04] and you know where they are does it
[1:19:06] really matter what size you are does it
[1:19:09] really matter what size you are whether
[1:19:12] you're this joint or that joint or that
[1:19:14] joint or this joint or this joint here I
[1:19:18] said well I I'm not as big I'm not as
[1:19:20] big well you know what I'm I'm sort of
[1:19:23] glad that my finger finger joints ain't
[1:19:25] as big as my hip joint my goodness you
[1:19:28] imagine what hands you'd have if your
[1:19:30] finger joints is that big you look like
[1:19:32] goli brother wouldn't you and how
[1:19:34] strange it would be to have a little
[1:19:36] bitty teeny finger attached right up
[1:19:39] here on my hip joint and you'd see me
[1:19:41] walking around on little legs about like
[1:19:43] this so I'd go around and say oh glory
[1:19:46] to God man ain't I something ain't I
[1:19:48] something look at my little T90 legs
[1:19:49] don't I look so cool y'all look at me
[1:19:51] say poor old brother Dy bless his heart
[1:19:53] he's got them little many old tiny legs
[1:19:56] I ain't never seen such tiny legs well
[1:19:58] that's the way a preacher does when he
[1:20:00] looks at the Sheep of God and see that
[1:20:02] they're in the wrong joint they're in
[1:20:05] the wrong place and they'll never be
[1:20:06] able to run right and they'll never be
[1:20:09] able to minister right look at what my
[1:20:11] hands can do with the right joints in
[1:20:14] the right place oh I hope you're hearing
[1:20:16] me this morning for whom the whole body
[1:20:20] fitly joined together and compacted
[1:20:25] compacted knit together assuredly
[1:20:28] together to cause to Coal to ca to Coal
[1:20:35] put together unite or t listen this
[1:20:38] unite together or knit together in
[1:20:42] affection to cause a person to unite one
[1:20:46] in a
[1:20:47] conclusion or come to the same opinion
[1:20:51] oh wow to come to a conclusion or come
[1:20:55] to the same opinion now do you honestly
[1:20:58] think that every one of those Ephesian
[1:21:00] Christian ever come to the place that
[1:21:02] there was no personal differences among
[1:21:04] them of course not human beings are
[1:21:07] human beings and we're always going to
[1:21:09] have difference of opinions somebody say
[1:21:12] amen amen you and your wife
[1:21:15] do amen of course you're praying for her
[1:21:18] that she'll come to her senses and she's
[1:21:20] praying for you that she'll come to
[1:21:21] yours because that's the way we are as
[1:21:24] human being so we'll never come to a
[1:21:27] spot that absolutely every message
[1:21:30] churches you know grees and every little
[1:21:32] Point our music will be different how we
[1:21:34] preach whether we read quotes how many
[1:21:37] quotes we read but look we agree on so
[1:21:40] much more than what we disagree on this
[1:21:44] must have been the way that it was in
[1:21:46] that early church that they were so
[1:21:48] compacted together but you go to the
[1:21:51] Ephesian church and then compare them to
[1:21:54] the gal chran church and the church at
[1:21:56] thessalonica and the church at Corinth
[1:21:58] it would probably been amazing I'd like
[1:22:01] to bring it to you sometime because I've
[1:22:02] I've got a study that I've studied years
[1:22:04] ago and I've took each church and just
[1:22:06] bring each church and show you the
[1:22:08] different issues and the different
[1:22:10] problems that they had and yet God
[1:22:13] identified them all as his but you know
[1:22:17] what I hate to say it but sometimes we
[1:22:18] specialize in minimizing how how many is
[1:22:21] the bride anyway and knocking people out
[1:22:24] of go going instead of trying to reach
[1:22:26] out and say come on Brother come on
[1:22:28] sister let's go let's grab one another
[1:22:30] let's go oh my may God help us you need
[1:22:35] help notice oh my from whom the whole
[1:22:39] body fitly fitly joined together and
[1:22:44] compacted by that which every joint
[1:22:48] Supply us so every joint is supplying
[1:22:52] and ministering oh oh goodness working
[1:22:56] in the measure of every part Carol's
[1:22:59] mother just turned 86 this past week
[1:23:03] she's got arthritis in her hands and
[1:23:05] poor saying bless her heart they they
[1:23:08] look absolutely awful they're just so
[1:23:10] twisted and contorted and and and she
[1:23:13] can't hardly reach for anything and
[1:23:15] Carol will try to call her and and
[1:23:17] she'll try to answer the phone and she
[1:23:19] can't can't hardly get the phone cuz
[1:23:21] she's trying to you know to take it in
[1:23:23] her hand and she'll want to call Carol
[1:23:26] or one of her boys and she'll she'll try
[1:23:28] to pick it up and she can't hardly do it
[1:23:31] we tried to get her a tap player where
[1:23:33] she could listen to sermons but she
[1:23:34] can't turn it on and she you know we
[1:23:37] triy to get her something and she's lost
[1:23:38] a sight in one of her eyes and and I I
[1:23:40] bought her a big giant print Bible she
[1:23:42] said I miss reading the Bible and the
[1:23:44] message books and I bought her a giant
[1:23:46] print Bible and Amazon sent it to her
[1:23:48] and we took her message books but she
[1:23:50] can't see and and so there's Parts about
[1:23:53] her body that she's losing this and that
[1:23:55] and the other but to see her hands all
[1:23:58] twisted up oh that's so pitiful and so
[1:24:01] sad but when you look at a child of God
[1:24:03] and spiritually they've got arcarius in
[1:24:06] their hands or in their joints and they
[1:24:08] can't pray like they used to pray oh
[1:24:10] come on children let's have a church
[1:24:12] today they don't read their Bible the
[1:24:14] way they used to read the Bible and
[1:24:16] they're so busy making money and they're
[1:24:19] so busy about this and that and the
[1:24:21] other oh but if there was ever a Time
[1:24:24] that we as the people of God need to be
[1:24:27] more in love with the Lord Jesus and
[1:24:30] more in love with one another I believe
[1:24:32] it's the hour that we are living in
[1:24:35] Remember The Virtue that's supposed to
[1:24:37] be manifested in its fullness in our day
[1:24:41] it is not faith I know we're emphasizing
[1:24:44] a lot on Miracles and a lot on signs and
[1:24:46] faith is part of it but the virtue of
[1:24:49] our day right before the Capstone it is
[1:24:52] not just knowledge it is not godliness
[1:24:55] but it is brotherly
[1:24:58] kindness brotherly
[1:25:02] kindness oh help us Lord
[1:25:05] Jesus notice according to the effectual
[1:25:08] working and the measure of every part
[1:25:11] make us
[1:25:13] increase of the body so the whole
[1:25:17] body is depending on the other
[1:25:21] parts I don't need you I don't need you
[1:25:23] I don't need need you oh that's not the
[1:25:25] spirit of
[1:25:26] God that's the devil
[1:25:30] mhm every part make us increase of the
[1:25:34] body unto the
[1:25:38] edifying of
[1:25:40] itself in
[1:25:42] love so you mean the body will actually
[1:25:45] get to a place when the bond of
[1:25:48] perfectness which is Charity will be put
[1:25:52] on top of the rest of our garment
[1:25:55] and it will edify
[1:25:58] itself so the ministry will have brought
[1:26:01] the people to a spot of
[1:26:04] edification that the body will start
[1:26:08] edifying itself through the glory of God
[1:26:12] so the body will minister to the body it
[1:26:15] won't just be the preacher it won't just
[1:26:18] be the deacons but the body will start
[1:26:21] loving the body and the body will be
[1:26:24] concerned well I've not seen this
[1:26:25] brother in church for a few weeks I'm
[1:26:27] going to contact brother Donnie maybe
[1:26:29] you need to contact that brother
[1:26:31] yourself maybe you need to contact that
[1:26:34] sister Hey sister been missing you in
[1:26:35] church why because that's the way your
[1:26:38] body does your body don't just wait on
[1:26:40] the head to reach out to the toe but all
[1:26:44] the parts of your body are concerned
[1:26:46] about each other that's the way God made
[1:26:50] us look at this word edifying here unto
[1:26:53] the edifying of itself in love building
[1:26:57] building up metaphorically edifying
[1:27:00] edification the act of one who
[1:27:03] promotes another's
[1:27:06] growth in Christian
[1:27:10] wisdom so you mean that ain't just a
[1:27:12] preacher's
[1:27:14] place oh my
[1:27:18] goodness let me read you this and every
[1:27:20] time I read this it just overwhelms me
[1:27:26] I think of a minister today that's
[1:27:28] called of
[1:27:29] God to step into the
[1:27:33] tracks where Jesus
[1:27:37] stood what a command what a commission
[1:27:40] but each that's called of God is
[1:27:43] commissioned to stand in that same place
[1:27:47] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:27:50] of the way each Minister's called to
[1:27:52] stand where he would The Works that I do
[1:27:55] shall you do also each minister is
[1:27:59] ordained of
[1:28:01] God and is
[1:28:03] commanded to stand in the tracks of
[1:28:06] Jesus
[1:28:08] Christ and perform the
[1:28:12] duties that Jesus
[1:28:18] performed that's quite a command isn't
[1:28:21] it
[1:28:24] so every godall
[1:28:27] man is called to step in the
[1:28:31] footprints of the Lord
[1:28:35] Jesus and Jesus never edified
[1:28:39] himself that's right as I mentioned to
[1:28:41] you a couple of weeks ago Jesus could
[1:28:42] have spent his whole time on the earth
[1:28:45] telling us how he created the
[1:28:47] heavens how he created the world you
[1:28:50] imagine all that he could have said I
[1:28:53] did this and I did that and I did this
[1:28:55] and I did that and I did this I made the
[1:28:58] heavens I made the Stars I made Urus I
[1:29:00] made Orion I made the belt in Orion I
[1:29:03] made pleades I made the
[1:29:06] andom Galaxy I made all those billions
[1:29:08] of Galaxy let me tell you how I did it I
[1:29:10] did this I did that I did that he could
[1:29:12] have went on and went on and went on and
[1:29:15] went on and yet he never even mentioned
[1:29:18] it when he was here
[1:29:22] right cuz it didn't come to tell us how
[1:29:24] great he was he come to express how
[1:29:27] little he become
[1:29:29] on that is truly greatness come on
[1:29:34] somebody notice now Paul in verse 20 in
[1:29:37] Ephesians 2 says and are built upon the
[1:29:40] foundation of the Apostles and the
[1:29:43] prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[1:29:47] Chief Cornerstone which is so
[1:29:50] unusual Paul doesn't say that Jesus was
[1:29:52] the foundation Stone wow but the
[1:29:57] apostles and the prophets were the
[1:30:00] foundation and Jesus in this great Act
[1:30:03] of humiliation laid
[1:30:06] himself on top of the
[1:30:09] Apostles and the
[1:30:13] prophets
[1:30:15] amen Jesus Christ himself being the
[1:30:18] Chief Cornerstone so a Cornerstone they
[1:30:20] did a little bit different of course
[1:30:21] than what we do today in their building
[1:30:23] so a Corner Stone would be shaped like
[1:30:25] this and it would tie together two walls
[1:30:30] so here was a gentile wall and a Jewish
[1:30:32] wall and what did the Lord Jesus do he
[1:30:36] was the Cornerstone and those walls run
[1:30:39] right together to form a brand new
[1:30:42] building or a new man as Paul related to
[1:30:46] it now in that he must lay himself down
[1:30:51] on on top of the teaching of the
[1:30:54] prophets and also the apostles in whom
[1:30:57] all the building fitly frames Paul must
[1:31:01] have really like this word now he comes
[1:31:04] from the anatomy of a human being to a
[1:31:06] building and he goes from the joints of
[1:31:09] the human anatomy being fitted together
[1:31:12] now he goes to framing a building and he
[1:31:15] says in whom all the building fitly
[1:31:19] framed together but this is one unusual
[1:31:22] building in this building the tubs grow
[1:31:27] in this building the concrete grows the
[1:31:30] tubis sixes grow the shingles grow the
[1:31:33] windows grow everything about this
[1:31:36] building it's made to where it grows you
[1:31:40] see if you try to build a house out of
[1:31:42] growing Lumber you're going to be in a
[1:31:44] mess aren't you but God don't want dead
[1:31:47] to befores he wants living members in
[1:31:51] the house of God so the prophets could
[1:31:54] grow the New Testament prophets did of
[1:31:56] course and the pastors they grow in
[1:31:59] their understanding and the teachers
[1:32:01] they grow in their understanding and the
[1:32:03] liy grows not only in their
[1:32:05] understanding but in their Walk With God
[1:32:07] all of us are a growing building of the
[1:32:11] most high God in whom all the building
[1:32:15] fitly framed together grow us unto a
[1:32:20] holy Temple praise God
[1:32:24] in the Lord in whom ye also are builded
[1:32:29] together for an
[1:32:32] habitation of
[1:32:36] god
[1:32:38] wow so the prophet in the Statue of a
[1:32:40] perfect man reads Ephesians 4 for the
[1:32:44] perfecting he said of God and he stalls
[1:32:47] and he says does it read that like that
[1:32:49] the perfecting of what
[1:32:51] Saints who are the Saints the Sanctified
[1:32:54] ones the ones who started from down here
[1:32:58] now remember he got this Blackboard
[1:32:59] there and he draws this pyramid shape
[1:33:01] and he draws these lines and put the
[1:33:03] virtues and The Messengers perfecting of
[1:33:06] the Saints for the work of the ministry
[1:33:09] the
[1:33:10] ministry of Jesus Christ for the
[1:33:13] edifying of the body of Christ edifying
[1:33:16] building it up edifying to become to the
[1:33:20] unity the faith of the knowledge of the
[1:33:22] Son of God into the perfect man unto the
[1:33:26] Assurance or the measure of the stature
[1:33:28] of the fullness of Christ did they have
[1:33:32] a portion of the Holy Ghost in the days
[1:33:36] of
[1:33:37] Luther Wesley Pentecost swingley Calvin
[1:33:43] George Whitfield Mueller all of those
[1:33:45] men was the spirit of God in those ages
[1:33:49] yes it was cuz the spirit of God started
[1:33:53] in the day of Paul of course with the
[1:33:56] new birth at the foundation
[1:33:59] level as they went into the time of the
[1:34:02] church age Darkness it got away from it
[1:34:05] but God said I will restore sayith the
[1:34:07] Lord but remember the attribute of the
[1:34:10] fullness of God was in that original
[1:34:13] Church to be lost during the time of the
[1:34:16] church ages but to be restored in the
[1:34:19] last day do we have the spirit of God
[1:34:23] yes don't get in your mind now that
[1:34:25] we're waiting out here somewhere well
[1:34:27] well ain't none of us got the Holy Ghost
[1:34:28] well it's evident some of us don't have
[1:34:30] it but speak for yourself cuz I do have
[1:34:32] the Holy Ghost and there's people all
[1:34:34] over the world that's got the baptism of
[1:34:36] the Holy Ghost but are we waiting for a
[1:34:39] refilling how many's wanting a refilling
[1:34:42] of the Holy Ghost are we waiting for the
[1:34:45] Dynamics to be able to place this church
[1:34:48] the Capstone or the finishing up of
[1:34:51] adoption which is what the attribute of
[1:34:55] the fullness of God comes back to the
[1:34:58] Earth as God caps off the individual God
[1:35:02] caps off the church now remember God's
[1:35:05] been making a body but he makes the
[1:35:07] entire body of the seven Church ages
[1:35:10] with the exact same material that he
[1:35:13] makes the
[1:35:15] individual exact same material now watch
[1:35:18] in Christ the mystery God in his
[1:35:21] fullness to die for the s of the people
[1:35:25] that he might bring to his church a
[1:35:28] Sanctified life that he might have the
[1:35:32] preeminence in
[1:35:34] fullness don't you see Word of Life this
[1:35:37] is what I want want us to get to does
[1:35:40] the spirit of God live in US yes many of
[1:35:43] us we've got the Holy Ghost we've got
[1:35:46] these things there but I we don't want
[1:35:47] to just have them in a miniature form we
[1:35:50] want them to control us we want them to
[1:35:55] control us where they are the power that
[1:35:58] controls our actions and
[1:36:02] reactions both not just actions that you
[1:36:05] do automatically but whenever someone
[1:36:08] treats you wrong and does you wrong you
[1:36:10] want those virtues are so manifested in
[1:36:13] your life they will control your
[1:36:15] reaction to what an individual treat you
[1:36:19] that's oh my to manifest every promise
[1:36:22] in these last days
[1:36:24] that he's promised I love this this next
[1:36:26] paragraph oh it to me is so awesome and
[1:36:29] through that purpose he achieved a
[1:36:31] church that he the fullness of God might
[1:36:35] bring to pass every promised word of God
[1:36:38] in the last days when
[1:36:41] he gets the
[1:36:44] pinenes
[1:36:47] preeminence in the
[1:36:49] church the
[1:36:52] position his
[1:36:57] place in the
[1:37:00] church he wants his place in our
[1:37:04] church God's given us a nice place to
[1:37:06] worship but what good does that do if
[1:37:09] he's not the preeminent one
[1:37:11] here what good does it do for us just to
[1:37:14] have a Christian profession well I
[1:37:16] believe the message I go to church and I
[1:37:18] pay my TI and that that's not what it's
[1:37:20] all about it's about him getting
[1:37:22] preeminence in us as
[1:37:25] individuals and the more of us that
[1:37:27] surrender now brother b m cracks down on
[1:37:29] this and blasphemous names and he said
[1:37:31] oh the Holy Ghost Church he said there
[1:37:33] is no such a thing there is no church
[1:37:36] anywhere where everybody in there's got
[1:37:38] the Holy Ghost and every one of them is
[1:37:40] going come on now that's why we mess up
[1:37:43] every time we go to make a denomination
[1:37:45] out of that certain move there is no
[1:37:47] move never has been never will be that
[1:37:49] everybody in there was filled with the
[1:37:50] Holy Ghost totally impossible but it
[1:37:53] will be this one and that one and that
[1:37:55] one and that one and they come to that
[1:37:57] place this is the ultimate of your life
[1:38:00] I don't care if you're a billionaire
[1:38:02] when you die I don't care if you live in
[1:38:04] the biggest house in Johnson City and
[1:38:06] you've got a 75c car garage I don't care
[1:38:09] what kind of car you drive I don't care
[1:38:11] people may say yes sir yes sir do you if
[1:38:14] you don't reach this you are not
[1:38:17] rapturing Material we can quote the
[1:38:20] message we can play brother Brandon
[1:38:22] every day of our life
[1:38:24] it's going to take the baptism of the
[1:38:26] Holy Ghost living in us and living out
[1:38:30] these virtues or we missed the
[1:38:33] [Applause]
[1:38:42] Rapture as I sat with my laptop in my
[1:38:44] lap last night and I read
[1:38:48] this tears trickling down my cheeks I
[1:38:51] said oh God
[1:38:53] this is what I want for
[1:38:56] me this is what I want for the sheep
[1:39:00] that you sent me to
[1:39:01] lead that
[1:39:03] Jesus can get his place you see I'm the
[1:39:07] Le of to sin Church age which is our
[1:39:09] church
[1:39:11] age we see the Lord Jesus standing
[1:39:13] outside the
[1:39:18] church knocking trying to get back in
[1:39:22] his own church
[1:39:26] now maybe you think today as a church
[1:39:28] collectively we don't do that I hope to
[1:39:30] God we
[1:39:31] don't but we got to bring it on down
[1:39:33] closer to home than just our church as a
[1:39:37] whole does he knock on the door of your
[1:39:41] time the door of your
[1:39:43] emotions the door of your feelings the
[1:39:46] door of your
[1:39:48] pride as an individual our church is no
[1:39:52] stronger than the people who make it up
[1:39:55] our church family is no stronger than
[1:39:57] the families who come here and make it
[1:39:59] up and our church as far as overall the
[1:40:03] headship of Christ in the body is no
[1:40:06] stronger than the individuals that
[1:40:08] Christ as an indivisual it's not just
[1:40:10] you and your wife and your children it's
[1:40:12] you children you're not going to go in
[1:40:15] on your daddy's experience your mama's
[1:40:17] experience or your pastors you've got to
[1:40:19] know God for yourself and knowing him is
[1:40:22] not
[1:40:24] enough he wants to control
[1:40:31] you but that's the hard part for all of
[1:40:34] us
[1:40:35] humans CU there's something about that
[1:40:39] self
[1:40:41] perseverance that we can't hardly let go
[1:40:44] of any y'all ever been 39,000 ft in the
[1:40:49] air and you're flying a 767 or a Airbus
[1:40:53] 340 or you know maybe the double decker
[1:40:57] 747 and all of a sudden you drop seems
[1:41:00] like forever you want to go up there and
[1:41:03] take them controls out of that Pilot's
[1:41:05] hands you ever been to a spot to where
[1:41:08] God said give me your anger give me your
[1:41:10] temper give me your hurt feelings to let
[1:41:12] me take care of it or give me your
[1:41:15] resentment but there's something about
[1:41:17] us as human beings we want to hold on to
[1:41:20] it cuz somehow we trust our own ability
[1:41:23] to able to deal with it well this person
[1:41:25] hurt me that person hurt me this person
[1:41:27] lied on me I'm just holding on to a
[1:41:29] little bit now of this stuff I'm afraid
[1:41:31] to let it go which is the worst thing
[1:41:33] you can ever do you can never never
[1:41:36] never be able to resolve what the Lord
[1:41:38] Jesus can take care of in a millisecond
[1:41:40] if you'll just let it go but the devil
[1:41:42] knows there's something about human
[1:41:44] beings that's selfish there's something
[1:41:46] about it we want to control ourself and
[1:41:49] we want to be able to protect ourself
[1:41:51] and we want to be able to protect our f
[1:41:53] feelings and there's something about
[1:41:54] that in us oh if God can ever get a
[1:41:57] group of people that could let go of
[1:41:59] everything they are now I'm not telling
[1:42:01] you to let go of that to anybody else
[1:42:04] but the Lord Jesus cuz people will abuse
[1:42:06] you and people will take advantage of
[1:42:08] that I'm talking about the master he's
[1:42:11] the only one that I can give everything
[1:42:13] I am to and know that he will never take
[1:42:16] advantage of it he will never abuse it
[1:42:18] and I want to encourage you today give
[1:42:21] him your fear give him your anxiety give
[1:42:24] him your unforgiving spirit give him
[1:42:27] your attitude against a brother or a
[1:42:29] sister and know that he's the only one
[1:42:32] that can take care of
[1:42:42] it around the earth together people have
[1:42:46] gathered in
[1:42:49] churches some of them in India have
[1:42:51] gathered under trees
[1:42:54] in Africa they've gathered just out in
[1:42:56] open public places I've been there and
[1:42:58] gathered with
[1:43:00] them but they've gathered to hear their
[1:43:03] ministers to see what they had to
[1:43:06] say once the service was done and they
[1:43:09] sang and they lifted the offering and
[1:43:11] all all that part of worship and then
[1:43:13] they walk out I wonder how many of them
[1:43:15] were
[1:43:16] edified and they received
[1:43:19] something that would help them be a
[1:43:21] better person into this stat
[1:43:24] so they walked in the measuring tape
[1:43:26] come up to about right here you know God
[1:43:28] measured Jesus and then he pulls it up
[1:43:30] on our life and boy some of us it gets
[1:43:33] past the big toe and we're in we're in
[1:43:34] mess of trouble a but some of you maybe
[1:43:37] you're way up here man you're coming
[1:43:39] higher higher and higher but see even
[1:43:41] that is still not what he
[1:43:43] wants he wants every bit of
[1:43:47] us and there's parts of us we don't mind
[1:43:50] Jesus having especially the trash
[1:43:53] yeah boy there's Parts about us that we
[1:43:57] reverence come on you're going to get
[1:43:59] quieter you're going to be like a bunch
[1:44:00] of Baptist on me this morning there's
[1:44:03] parts of us that we oh we just have the
[1:44:05] offest time ever was letting go of
[1:44:08] believe it or not it's sacred to
[1:44:12] us it's
[1:44:14] sacred it's Hallowed
[1:44:19] Ground World War yeah can you imagine
[1:44:22] anybody
[1:44:23] believing that a temper is
[1:44:25] sacred an unforgiving spirit being
[1:44:29] sacred what's this in there there would
[1:44:33] come a
[1:44:34] time when he could express
[1:44:38] himself in
[1:44:40] fullness of
[1:44:43] godhead
[1:44:46] deity through his church
[1:44:53] now you see that was
[1:44:55] missing in all these stages here after
[1:44:58] the first stage of
[1:45:00] Faith the attribute of the fullness of
[1:45:03] the
[1:45:04] godhead was not in the
[1:45:07] body but it's got to come
[1:45:10] back for the first church was in the
[1:45:14] image of the Son of
[1:45:16] God and he's coming back after a wife
[1:45:20] that doesn't have a finger attach to a
[1:45:23] hip joint and have a leg appear for a
[1:45:27] nose joint that better to be weird
[1:45:29] wouldn't it but for a body that he can
[1:45:33] flow through her and say move
[1:45:38] finger the prophet said if my mind and
[1:45:42] my brain would try to control my body
[1:45:44] and from my mind would come assault and
[1:45:48] tell my body to move but yet my body was
[1:45:55] concrete my brain could think and think
[1:45:58] and project the thought and project the
[1:46:01] thought but there'd be nothing no
[1:46:03] sensory perceptions nothing that could
[1:46:06] move in seconds to be able to come to
[1:46:08] the fingers the toes all all that sort
[1:46:09] of St there'd be no communication
[1:46:12] channel so from here down I would just
[1:46:15] be
[1:46:17] concrete and the Brain would say love
[1:46:19] one another forgive one another pray for
[1:46:22] one another oh pray for them that
[1:46:23] despitefully use you but the concrete
[1:46:26] body just St
[1:46:28] her the head would say when you come to
[1:46:30] church worship me praise me as a matter
[1:46:35] of fact don't wait till you get to
[1:46:36] church but do it on your way to church
[1:46:39] do it at home do it on your job I love
[1:46:42] your worship and your praise but the
[1:46:44] body just stands
[1:46:47] there and the thoughts are thinking love
[1:46:50] worship forgiveness kindness tenderness
[1:46:56] Mercy but in the molding part of these
[1:46:59] Church
[1:47:01] ages they've done good to be able to
[1:47:04] believe the just shall live by
[1:47:08] faith and then the thoughts start
[1:47:10] becoming a little bit more
[1:47:11] clear
[1:47:13] sanctification quit smoking quit lying
[1:47:16] quit this and
[1:47:19] that some movement got in the body
[1:47:24] praise the Lord is the concrete being
[1:47:27] transformed is something happening to
[1:47:29] the rebar and the concrete the gravel
[1:47:31] and the cement and the potash and
[1:47:33] everything that makes up concrete
[1:47:35] there's some Life coming in then in
[1:47:37] Pentecost Oh Glory to God hallelujah boy
[1:47:40] they had some movement didn't they I
[1:47:42] mean their tongue started speaking in
[1:47:44] tongue I ain't making fun of that now

[1:47:47] they started shout glory to God
[1:47:51] hallelujah have enough temp to fight a
[1:47:53] buz saw yeah run down one another come
[1:47:56] on criticize one another or they had a
[1:47:58] lot of movement all right it's one thing
[1:48:00] about that tongue getting loose you got
[1:48:01] to watch what it does cuz it can be set
[1:48:04] on fire of the Holy Ghost or set on fire
[1:48:06] of hell oh well Preacher Brother Donnie

[1:48:36] [Music]

[1:49:16] you the upright which is what they call
[1:49:17] the walls you know on that day he said

[1:50:29] these words until these virtues here go
[1:50:33] into you you're still off the true
[1:50:35] foundation of Faith but when these
[1:50:37] virtues grow
[1:50:40] in as you added to that to that then you
[1:50:44] are a living
[1:50:48] Monument you are a
[1:50:50] living moving

[1:51:35] worship so this is what a man would say
[1:51:38] to a woman this is what a
[1:51:40] woman would say to a

[1:52:43] worshiping all that oh no the prophet
[1:52:45] would have never said the statements
[1:52:46] that he said about coming to the house
[1:52:48] of God where the name of Jesus Christ is
[1:52:51] their God and His people are worshiped
[1:52:56] together what if we're being worshiped
[1:52:59] together and we're worshiping
[1:53:01] him who is adoring and loving
[1:53:12] her I wonder what our church services
[1:53:15] could be if we could receive just what I
[1:53:18] said to
[1:53:21] you that the Lord God wants to come in
[1:53:23] this place and make love to his
[1:53:29] brother to pull you up near him and heal

[1:53:35] problems and your issues in your life
[1:53:39] and change
[1:53:40] you by
[1:53:44] love let me close but we not in an
[1:53:47] imaginary way we prostrate ourselves
[1:53:49] before a living God a living virtue virt

[1:54:19] casting out devils and Healing The Sick
[1:54:20] and going to the hospital and empty out
[1:54:22] all the
[1:54:24] hospitals brother R said we got
[1:54:26] screaming and shouting and all that he
[1:54:27] said that's because of our
[1:54:30] faith and people think well glory to God
[1:54:32] hallelujah we lay hands on the sick and
[1:54:34] they recover that don't mean you've got
[1:54:35] one liquor brotherly kindness yeah
[1:54:38] that's the first virtue on the bottom
[1:54:40] face but yet that's the way we're
[1:54:42] judging how spiritual we are and how
[1:54:43] great we are how great our ministry is
[1:54:45] how do you treat those that love you how
[1:54:48] do you treat those who hate you how do
[1:54:50] you treat those that despise you and run
[1:54:52] your name down come on somebody and

[1:54:58] tell you children it's evident to see to
[1:55:00] me that bunch of trash come straight out
[1:55:01] of the pits of hell cuz people get unar

[1:55:09] Instagram and they want to preach the
[1:55:10] word a little bit well preach it brother

[1:55:19] there and run people down don't get in
[1:55:21] there and run come on don't get quiet on
[1:55:23] me Word of Life if we're going to be a
[1:55:25] child of God you want to be a child of
[1:55:26] God on Instagram you want to be a child
[1:55:28] of God on Facebook and if you can't
[1:55:31] handle it get rid of it if you can't

[1:55:51] off with an old phone I'll tell you one
[1:55:53] thing going to hell is not going to be
[1:55:56] worth anything in this life you'll
[1:55:58] forfeit Christ
[1:55:59] [Applause]
[1:56:13] for let me finish this quote the same
[1:56:15] things that Jesus did walking in the
[1:56:19] same way he walked doing the same things
[1:56:21] he did de because it's not an imaginary
[1:56:25] thing there's a reality that proves it
[1:56:26] see what I mean see how these virtues
[1:56:30] these building materials typed in with
[1:56:32] the church
[1:56:35] Messengers with the
[1:56:37] church
[1:56:39] ages now this is the house that God
[1:56:42] dwells in not a building with a big Bell
[1:56:45] on the top of it in a high
[1:56:47] steeple but a
[1:56:50] body has s th prepared
[1:56:55] me a
[1:56:57] body a body that God can dwell in God
[1:57:00] can walk in God can see
[1:57:04] in God can talk
[1:57:07] in God can work in living
[1:57:12] instrumentality of God God walking hallu
[1:57:18] on two
[1:57:19] feet that's it yes sir
[1:57:23] sir a godall preacher points his fingers
[1:57:27] out this way a kingdom Builder when he
[1:57:29] reads that quote points his fingers this
[1:57:36] way I used to watch superheroes when I
[1:57:39] was a kid at home when we had a
[1:57:41] television Batman Superman all them
[1:57:45] Heroes Charles
[1:57:48] Atlas you've heard me tell it before and
[1:57:51] I got on comic magazine and I seen that
[1:57:53] bodybuilding stuff on the back of it I
[1:57:55] ordered that
[1:57:58] course is you can tell it didn't
[1:58:02] work I look more like Gomer pow or
[1:58:04] somebody like that
[1:58:09] don't but one
[1:58:12] day I sing about it yesterday I don't
[1:58:14] know why but it kept coming back to me
[1:58:15] several times during the day and early
[1:58:17] this morning I woke up early for
[1:58:18] daylight and it kept coming back to me
[1:58:20] again and my mama's words
[1:58:23] because he wasn't raised in a Christian
[1:58:24] home so mama had got saved at my uncle's
[1:58:27] church and then something started
[1:58:29] dealing with
[1:58:30] me and I remember the words that I asked
[1:58:33] mama and I said
[1:58:35] Mama how do you get
[1:58:38] saved how how how do you
[1:58:41] pray you talk about ignorant Carol gave
[1:58:44] her life story here to our youth couple
[1:58:47] months back she sat back there in one of
[1:58:49] the Sunday School rooms and I watched
[1:58:51] our youth as she told
[1:58:53] it she gave her heart to God when she
[1:58:55] was
[1:58:56] 16 she never heard of Daniel and the
[1:58:58] Lions then until she was 16 years
[1:59:02] old never heard of Jonah and the whale
[1:59:06] never heard of
[1:59:08] Moses never heard anything about God's
[1:59:12] word but God had a plan for her wanted
[1:59:16] her to be a preacher's wife yeah poor
[1:59:19] old saying bless her heart she had to be
[1:59:21] married to me
[1:59:23] her and sister Glenda will probably get
[1:59:24] the same reward it'll be great rewards
[1:59:26] won't it that's what I thought Brother
[1:59:28] Lou said how long they' been married I
[1:59:29] said God bless sister Glendon glory to
[1:59:35] God let me tell you something friend
[1:59:38] people around the world may know me they
[1:59:40] may know brother Daryl brother Bill the
[1:59:43] preachers but you don't have no idea
[1:59:46] what that preacher's wife goes
[1:59:48] through I wonder how many burdens sister
[1:59:50] Shirley bore brother Bill how many night
[1:59:52] she laid away crying for people in your
[1:59:54] church and issues going on and this and
[1:59:56] that and the
[1:59:58] other we get in our mind the superheroes
[2:00:01] of men that they'll walk up there that
[2:00:02] day and boy God's going to do this and
[2:00:04] that and other I wonder if it ain't
[2:00:06] going to be quite a bit different than
[2:00:08] what we think but there'll be little
[2:00:10] Daughters of God That'll Walk up through
[2:00:12] there they never preached they
[2:00:14] couldn't they never traveled and you
[2:00:17] know done a lot of things the way men
[2:00:18] could they couldn't but when they stand
[2:00:21] there by their
[2:00:23] preacher husband they walk
[2:00:26] together they stand up before the Lord
[2:00:29] Jesus and he looks down there sister
[2:00:32] Shirley and calls her by her word name
[2:00:35] whatever that is and gives her reward
[2:00:37] and tell her what she's done and how she
[2:00:39] stood with Brother Bill and how she
[2:00:41] mothered her children and how she helped
[2:00:47] people sometimes Carol I wake up in the
[2:00:49] morning I say you sleep good she said no
[2:00:52] I had sister so and so on my mind I had
[2:00:54] brother so and so on the Mind been
[2:00:55] praying for this one been praying for
[2:00:57] that one been praying for that one I was
[2:00:58] wake about all
[2:01:00] night that's a real pastor's wife
[2:01:05] yeah I believe I'll be standing near
[2:01:08] when she walks before him that day and
[2:01:11] hear him give her a reward same with
[2:01:13] Deacon's wives same with evangelous
[2:01:16] wives now your brothers that aren't
[2:01:19] preachers now bring it down to your home
[2:01:22] and your wife prayed for some of you men
[2:01:24] when you wasn't really doing very good
[2:01:26] at all as a matter of fact you needed a
[2:01:29] weapon you needed your hide
[2:01:33] switched but your little wife wouldn't
[2:01:35] let go of you when you was as rebellious
[2:01:37] and as hard-headed as you could be maybe
[2:01:39] you messed up big time and it hurt her
[2:01:42] like to destroyed her but she wouldn't
[2:01:44] let
[2:01:45] go thank God for such
[2:01:50] women amen
[2:01:52] go
[2:01:53] ahead let's give them a little flow
[2:01:55] right
[2:02:01] now God don't want just preachers to be
[2:02:05] this but you
[2:02:10] sisters a body hast thou prepared me God
[2:02:16] walking on two
[2:02:19] feet let's B together
[2:02:28] Heavenly Father we
[2:02:31] believe what we've heard today
[2:02:35] Lord as I take the measure in tape of
[2:02:38] the Lord Jesus and
[2:02:40] I measure myself I think oh God help
[2:02:46] me physically I might have been a little
[2:02:49] bit taller than you I might have waited
[2:02:51] bit bit
[2:02:54] more but that's not the way I measuring
[2:02:57] myself most of us want to measure oursel
[2:02:59] in comparison to
[2:03:01] Sinners yeah we'll always feel better by
[2:03:04] doing
[2:03:05] that but you don't want us to measure
[2:03:08] ourselves by Sinners or by
[2:03:09] denominational
[2:03:11] people our measurement is
[2:03:14] you so no matter who we are for a
[2:03:17] preacher Deacon trustey housewife just a
[2:03:20] teenager going to school
[2:03:22] when we all are measured by that great
[2:03:25] measure we always seem to come
[2:03:30] short Lord God we're so grateful that we
[2:03:32] can say like the sister that wanted to
[2:03:36] testify ain't what I ought to
[2:03:39] be and I ain't what I want to be but
[2:03:42] there's one thing I know for sure I
[2:03:44] ain't what I used to
[2:03:47] be Lord Jesus help us father
[2:03:52] we want to grow
[2:03:54] Lord we want to grow in faith virtue and
[2:03:58] knowledge and all these wonderful things
[2:04:01] till each one of them will be a stepping
[2:04:03] stone for the other and it's an
[2:04:05] Administration that's open so some
[2:04:08] people come to Faith and that's where
[2:04:09] they focus the rest of their life some
[2:04:12] preachers around the message that's
[2:04:13] where they are right now are just
[2:04:15] focusing so much on Faith and Healing
[2:04:17] and miracles and oh it's just faith
[2:04:20] faith faith faith healing healing
[2:04:21] miracles Miracles
[2:04:23] Miracles but Faith should be a stepping
[2:04:25] stone to open up the other
[2:04:28] Administration that's before us which is
[2:04:32] virtue your Prophet told us virtue was
[2:04:35] not living a virgin life but it was
[2:04:38] having strength to minister to
[2:04:41] others that's the way you did whenever
[2:04:44] we look at the Sevenfold attributes
[2:04:46] we're looking at your personage
[2:04:50] yourself and the last one we come to
[2:04:53] before the Capstone is brotherly
[2:04:55] kindness how will I ever be able to have
[2:04:58] brotherly
[2:04:59] kindness because you had it for
[2:05:04] me you put up with me when I was wrong
[2:05:08] you put up with me when I've been out of
[2:05:11] the way even after I got
[2:05:14] saved it was your brotherly
[2:05:17] kindness that has intervened from me so
[2:05:20] many times
[2:05:23] and even Paul wrote In the book of
[2:05:25] Hebrews and said that he would declare
[2:05:28] his father's name among the Brethren and
[2:05:31] again he said he's not
[2:05:34] ashamed to call them
[2:05:39] Brethren so brotherly
[2:05:42] kindness is what issues from your
[2:05:46] soul and you would call us
[2:05:50] Brothers oh almighty God creator of the
[2:05:53] heavens and the
[2:05:55] Earth would call us
[2:06:00] Brothers oh Jesus help us today
[2:06:05] Father they ever head bowed and no one
[2:06:07] looking around please let me just say
[2:06:09] Lord I need more of you
[2:06:12] Jesus I need
[2:06:15] more I want these things in my life
[2:06:19] Lord oh Jesus I
[2:06:22] I I I I can see all of them I I I can
[2:06:25] see all of those things but I I don't
[2:06:28] want to just see
[2:06:30] them in
[2:06:31] infancy I want to see it
[2:06:34] matured grown
[2:06:37] up till you can take complete control of
[2:06:41] me oh
[2:06:44] Jesus in the stage where we are in
[2:06:47] science one of the Nick's biggest IND
[2:06:50] Industries as far as what they made
[2:06:51] known to us is
[2:06:53] AI artificial
[2:06:56] intelligence when we do a Google search
[2:06:58] or Yahoo whatever search engine we use
[2:07:01] they've now got a certain symbol
[2:07:03] designated for AI before it was a
[2:07:07] magnify glass to represent search and
[2:07:09] different ones and now ai has been
[2:07:11] assigned its own symbol and we can
[2:07:14] search by AI so the world has come to
[2:07:18] the
[2:07:19] place of artificial intelligence
[2:07:22] and the prophet tells us the last
[2:07:26] thing the last moving part is the eyes
[2:07:31] prophetic the next thing is the
[2:07:33] intelligence to step into the
[2:07:36] body and we have no intelligence of our
[2:07:41] own so if the mind of Christ is telling
[2:07:44] us love one another but our bodies are
[2:07:47] concrete we say I can't forgive him I
[2:07:49] cannot forgive her
[2:07:52] he preached against me he throwed that
[2:07:54] sermon right I will not forgive them our
[2:07:56] bodies are
[2:07:58] concrete help us Lord Jesus I don't want
[2:08:02] to just lay hands on the sick and watch
[2:08:04] them get well and I've seen that
[2:08:06] thousands of times but I want to love
[2:08:09] the way you
[2:08:11] loved I want to have brotherly kindness
[2:08:14] Lord Jesus for my
[2:08:17] brothers when they trespass against me
[2:08:21] as to ask you so how many times Lord
[2:08:23] should I forgive my brother a day
[2:08:27] seven and then you overwhelmed them by
[2:08:29] your great response but I say unto you
[2:08:32] 70 Time s we'll look at it Lord willing

[2:08:37] night oh Jesus help us
