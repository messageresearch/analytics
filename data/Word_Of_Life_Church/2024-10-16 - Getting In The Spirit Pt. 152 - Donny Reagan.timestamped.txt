[11:45] Again.
[11:46] One more time. Again, it's good to be

[11:50] and tell them you're glad to see him in
[11:52] the house of the Lord tonight. Amen.
[11:54] What a privilege it is to be here. So
[11:57] glad that you're with us here in the
[11:59] service tonight. If we have any
[12:01] visitors, and I see some, we want to say
[12:03] we welcome you to the assembly tonight.
[12:06] May God bless you for being here.
[12:09] Wherever you're from, we're just so glad
[12:11] to have each and every one of you. And
[12:13] to all of our streamers locally and
[12:15] around the world, we want to say, God
[12:17] bless our streamers. Give all of those
[12:19] folks a good hand tonight if you will.
[12:25] Praise the name of the Lord. Well, isn't
[12:28] it good to just know that God cares
[12:30] about you?
[12:31] You know, you had friends in your in
[12:33] your time, in your life that you thought
[12:35] they really loved you, and you found out
[12:38] it didn't really work out the way you
[12:39] thought it would, but I'm so glad that
[12:42] we've got a savior that loves us
[12:44] unconditionally. Aren't you glad about
[12:46] that tonight? Somebody say, "Praise the
[12:48] Lord."
[12:49] Amen. We're going to look at our prayer
[12:51] request at this time. First of all, we
[12:53] have have a card of of thanks. Uh this
[12:56] is from some folks and uh I hope I get
[13:00] this name of this county right.
[13:01] Blessings from Ephen Ephenham County,
[13:05] Georgia. We are praying for you all and
[13:08] are thankful for the opportunity to help
[13:10] in some small way as you serve your
[13:14] community. To God be the glory. Well,
[13:17] just give the Lord another good hand
[13:19] clap of praise for that tonight. Amen.
[13:23] Amen. And it takes us all working
[13:25] together, don't it? Praise the Lord.
[13:28] Sister Janet Payne sends in this prayer
[13:30] request tonight to remember the Loris
[13:32] family. I believe hospice care is
[13:34] watching him now at this time. So we
[13:37] certainly want to just pray that brother
[13:39] Lewis has been sick for a long, long
[13:41] time, but he's a fighter. So we just
[13:43] pray that the will of the Lord would be
[13:45] done. If it's time for him to go, I
[13:47] believe he's ready to go. And if he
[13:49] wants, if the Lord wants him to stay,
[13:51] ain't nothing can take him. Amen. Praise
[13:53] the Lord. Uh, Brother Doug Sadler from
[13:56] West Virginia, they have sent a message
[13:58] that they need a request for prayer
[14:01] sending on his behalf tonight. Very,
[14:03] very sick situation. The Lord knows all
[14:06] about that need. And my our grandson
[14:08] tonight, Drew Blevins, had a lot of
[14:11] dental work done today, some wisdom
[14:13] teeth taken out. So, he's in quite a bit
[14:15] of pain. if you'd remember him tonight
[14:17] in prayer. Sister Ruth Louise Jax is
[14:20] asking for prayer for her sister Mary,
[14:23] that God will take away the pain that
[14:25] she's experiencing and give her healing
[14:27] in her body.
[14:30] Sister Ruth is also asking for prayer
[14:32] that God will lead and guide her
[14:34] concerning some financial situations
[14:36] that she's facing. We'll just commit
[14:38] that to the Lord. Brother Terry Stockton
[14:41] wants us to remember her, his mother
[14:43] tonight in prayer, 91 years young,
[14:46] serious condition, intestinal condition.
[14:48] So, we want to remember her as we pray
[14:50] tonight that the Lord would be mindful
[14:52] of that situation. And we just uh I know
[14:56] there's many needs in our group tonight.
[14:57] How many of you have an unspoken prayer
[14:59] request you'd like for this assembly to
[15:01] pray about? We just want to commend all
[15:03] these things unto the Lord. Good to see
[15:05] Sammy and Jill Huard here in the service
[15:07] with us tonight. Amen, Sammy. The Lord
[15:10] the Lord spared you, buddy. We're
[15:12] thankful for that. God's good, isn't he?
[15:14] Give the Lord a good hand clap of praise
[15:16] tonight. Amen.

[17:39] Hallelujah. Brother Rob, come tonight if
[17:41] you will pray over these needs. Just
[17:43] want to give a a couple of updates to
[17:45] you tonight.
[17:47] I'm glad my wife's able to be in service
[17:49] with us tonight. Uh the the doctor's
[17:52] checked her uh pretty thoroughly today
[17:55] and waiting on some test results, but
[17:57] the Lord has touched her and she's able
[17:59] to be back in service and I thank the
[18:01] Lord for that. I really do.
[18:04] Amen.
[18:09] She's 76 and I'm 75.
[18:12] But I love her more now than I ever did
[18:14] in my life. I mean that from my heart.
[18:17] Our love should grow for one another.
[18:19] Amen.
[18:20] Praise the Lord. Well, I won't say no
[18:22] more about that.
[18:24] Brother Larry Elliott is on his way to
[18:27] Nashville, Tennessee to Vanderbilt
[18:29] Hospital.
[18:31] He's got an appointment there on Friday,
[18:33] I believe it is. Uh, brother Larry's
[18:36] looking at open heart surgery.
[18:38] Uh, they don't know if they'll do it
[18:40] while he's there this time. It just
[18:42] depends on the severity of the
[18:44] situation. They may send him back home
[18:47] and reschedu or schedule for a later
[18:50] time. But I certainly want to pray for
[18:51] our brother tonight that the Lord would
[18:53] We appreciate brother Larry, don't we?
[18:55] You know,
[18:57] most of us don't realize the sacrifice
[19:01] that Brother Larry puts in working with
[19:04] our special singers and getting the all
[19:06] the chords and stuff right. And I want
[19:08] to say I appreciate Brother Larry. He's
[19:10] not here, but we appreciate him, don't
[19:12] we? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[19:16] Right. Here's another guy we kind of
[19:18] took a liking to. Brother Rob Weber. We
[19:22] don't know why we like you, but we do,
[19:24] buddy. Amen.
[19:26] Don't think about it. Don't think about
[19:28] it. We love you, buddy. Appreciate you.
[19:31] We love brother Louie, too.
[19:34] Let's pray. Dear Lord, thank you. We
[19:37] always thanksgiving that we come before
[19:39] you in prayer and thanksgiving and and
[19:41] my brothers and sisters, we come before
[19:43] you humbly in our hearts asking that you
[19:46] bind up the brokenhearted,
[19:48] right? Preach deliverance to the
[19:50] captives. Lord, bring liberty to this
[19:52] service. I pray. I thank you for these
[19:54] prayer requests and I thank you for all
[19:56] the the things that were mentioned here.
[19:57] Brother Larry was so dear to me and what
[19:59] was dear is the life they lived before
[20:01] me for five years that I could see
[20:03] Christ in him. I pray that you go to him
[20:05] now wherever he is and heal up the
[20:08] brokenhearted. I pray in spirit and in
[20:11] truth and we ask you Lord for these
[20:12] things and we know that you're you're
[20:14] desiring to do this in us for we are the
[20:17] final voice to the final ages we have
[20:18] been taught. Lord, help us manifest what
[20:20] you see in us. And I pray, Lord, that
[20:23] these prayer requests be testimonies of
[20:24] the living God bringing forth
[20:26] deliverance, Lord, to the flood victims,
[20:28] to the volunteers, and that it's more
[20:30] than just a sandwich. That it's a a
[20:32] spiritual thing that we're able to
[20:33] minister into the people in our
[20:34] community. Thank you, Lord, for your
[20:36] grace. Help us live up to what it is
[20:38] that you've called us to. And thank you
[20:39] for caring for us. Help us to care more
[20:41] for you in this service and the days
[20:43] ahead in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[33:39] in the fire,
[33:42] cause fear.
[33:45] He is a liar.
[33:50] When he told you you were troubled,
[33:53] you'll forever be alone.
[33:57] When he told you you should run away,
[34:01] you'll never find a home.
[34:04] When he told you you were dirty
[34:08] and you shouldn't be ashamed.
[34:11] When he told you you could be the one.
[34:15] That grace can never change.

[36:08] happiness.
[36:10] Cast your fear
[36:14] in the fire.
[36:18] calls fear.
[36:21] He is a liar.
[36:24] Cast your fear
[36:28] in the fire
[36:32] cause fear.
[36:35] He is a liar.
[36:40] [Music]
[36:42] [Applause]
[37:08] [Music]
[37:18] You can't seem to hide.
[37:23] The hurt written on your face.
[37:27] You're broken inside.
[37:31] [Music]
[37:32] Longing for love's embrace.
[37:36] And it might be a while before you
[37:40] smile. I know cuz I fought that fight.
[37:46] And weeping may endure for the night.
[37:55] But it's almost morning.
[38:00] Joy will replace the tears.
[38:04] Calm all your darkest fears.
[38:09] It won't be long

[38:46] I can relate with you.
[38:51] And I have prayed to see the sun break
[38:55] free while the storm was still inside.
[39:01] So when your darkness
[39:03] consumes the guiding
[39:07] light,
[39:09] remember
[39:12] that it's almost morning.
[39:16] Joy will replace the tears.

[40:21] cuz it's almost morning.
[40:25] No, don't give up on your faith
[40:36] cuz it's almost morning.
[40:45] [Music]
[40:48] [Applause]
[40:56] Amen. Let's all stand tonight.
[41:03] Amen. Did you enjoy all those songs?
[41:05] They were good, weren't they?
[41:07] Give them another good hand if you will
[41:09] tonight.
[41:12] Amen. Let's sing this little chorus
[41:14] together as brother Donnie gets ready to
[41:17] come bring us the word of the Lord
[41:18] tonight. Spread your wings, little
[41:21] eagles and fly. Amen. How many of you
[41:23] glad to be an eagle tonight?
[41:26] What's the rest of you? If you're not
[41:29] eagles, what are you? How many of you
[41:31] glad to be eagles tonight? Somebody say,
[41:34] "Praise the Lord." Give him one more
[41:37] good hand clap of praise. Amen.
[41:42] So spread your wings
[41:46] little
[41:48] goes and fly.
[41:53] Oh, you weren't born for the valley.
[41:59] You were born to soar in the sky. Don't
[42:04] let your trials get you down
[42:09] or drive your spirit to the ground.
[42:14] Bound up with wings
[42:20] and fly. Sing it out. Spread your wings.
[42:27] [Music]
[42:30] Oh, sing it to a church.
[42:34] Oh, you weren't born for the valley.
[42:40] You were born so in the sky. No
[42:49] [Music]
[42:55] [Applause]
[42:57] heat.
[42:59] Yeah.
[43:00] [Music]
[43:06] Heat.
[43:13] [Music]
[43:22] [Music]
[43:27] Don't let your tr
[43:32] [Music]
[43:41] [Music]
[43:48] the Lord's
[43:50] glad you're an eagle tonight.
[43:51] Amen.
[43:52] Well, there's a time we probably thought
[43:54] we as chickens and we wasn't really sure
[43:56] what we was. God by his word let us
[44:00] realize that there was something
[44:02] greater, something bigger than us,
[44:05] something that the mighty God had
[44:07] thought about before the foundation of
[44:09] the world. How many's happy to be in the
[44:10] house of the Lord tonight?
[44:12] Praise the Lord. I'd like to wish two
[44:15] special young ladies a happy birthday
[44:20] today.
[44:21] It's Miss Leah and Miss Maria Parker.
[44:26] My granddaughters.
[44:28] [Music]
[44:36] We love them so much. So daddy asked
[44:39] them if they'd like to go out of town
[44:41] for their birthday if they'd like to do
[44:43] something special.
[44:46] So you know what they wanted to do?
[44:48] Come to church. Amen.
[44:51] [Music]
[44:56] You see,
[44:58] even though it's been a year ago today
[45:01] that the Lord took their mama,
[45:05] but their mama's life,
[45:08] their mama's teaching
[45:11] is still living them four girls
[45:15] and it l and we are so proud of them.
[45:19] Amen.
[45:21] We want to say thank you for praying for
[45:22] us. Praying for us of course this whole
[45:25] year and especially today. I've got
[45:28] texts and emails and WhatsApps and every
[45:31] other way of communication uh from
[45:34] people all over everywhere and um
[45:37] Africa, India. We just want to say thank
[45:40] you. I know people go through this all
[45:43] the time. All the time. Every day people
[45:45] go through things like this and they do
[45:48] it without the Lord
[45:50] and they do it without his people.
[45:53] I'm just so glad I didn't have to.
[45:57] I'm glad I didn't have to do it without
[45:58] the Lord and without his people.
[46:01] Aren't you glad when you face things,
[46:03] you have the Lord, you have his people.
[46:06] Maybe I'm not as smart, maybe scientific
[46:09] as other people, but I don't mind
[46:12] telling you there's been times in my
[46:13] life I needed God with skin on it.
[46:19] Just somebody to be able to pick up the
[46:20] phone or just drop you a line or
[46:23] whatever and let you know that they love
[46:25] you, that they're praying for you. And
[46:27] we're we're certainly appreciative of
[46:30] all of that. Again, I wanted to say how
[46:32] much I appreciate
[46:34] all of those um volunteers and those
[46:37] that are still distributing the food,
[46:40] the generators,
[46:42] water, everything else in the world that
[46:44] you can imagine from our fellowship hall
[46:46] there. Um still sending out several
[46:49] loads, some more going out again
[46:51] tomorrow. Found some more areas that are
[46:55] in real need. And um there was uh two
[46:59] more states that I wanted to mention
[47:00] after Sunday, Indiana and Alabama that
[47:04] we add to that list. And that's of
[47:06] people who's driven here,
[47:08] right?
[47:08] Um and brought uh truckloads, trucks
[47:11] with trailers, all kinds of different
[47:14] things. And u we're so appreciative for
[47:17] all of them doing that. For those of you
[47:19] that have taken your time, some as I
[47:21] said, it's taken awful work. Some
[47:23] sacrificed a great deal. mothers
[47:25] bringing their babies and their children
[47:27] along. And thank each of you for what
[47:30] you've done. We so appreciate it with
[47:31] all of our hearts. Let's turn tonight to
[47:34] the book of Joel, chapter 2, verse 28.
[47:41] I love this prophecy of the Old
[47:42] Testament. It's one of my favorites
[47:44] actually of uh the coming of the
[47:47] presence of God. And though Joel was a
[47:50] very small book as far as chapters in
[47:54] relation to say Isaiah, Jeremiah, but
[47:57] yet he spoke some some profound things.
[48:01] Now this is what I believe about
[48:05] prophecy.
[48:07] Okay,
[48:08] just so you understand what I believe
[48:11] about prophecy.
[48:14] When someone prophesies,
[48:17] they are saying something that is going
[48:20] to happen or something that is going to
[48:24] come to pass.
[48:27] So prophecy is not someone saying,
[48:30] "Yeah, I the Lord say I'm here."
[48:34] That is not future.
[48:37] Come on. Yeah. Yeah. The Lord say that I
[48:40] I I said I would bless you and I I'm I
[48:43] I've blessed you tonight.
[48:45] That is not foretelling.
[48:48] That's right.
[48:49] Hello. The microphone must have quit on
[48:51] me.
[48:53] Well, come on now. Do we believe?
[48:55] Look at the word. Look at the word.
[48:57] Check it out in the Hebrew lexican if
[48:59] you like and see what the word prophecy,
[49:01] prophet, prophetic actually means.
[49:04] And now watch. A prophet is going to
[49:07] give a prophecy. Joel 2:28.
[49:12] And it shall come to pass afterward
[49:17] that I will pour out my spirit
[49:21] upon all flesh,
[49:24] and your sons and your daughters
[49:29] shall prophesy.
[49:32] Your old men shall dream dreams
[49:36] and your young men shall see visions.
[49:40] Now watch how detailed prophecy can be.
[49:45] It's not like a lot of the modern day
[49:48] stuff.
[49:49] Oh,
[49:53] the Lord the Lord is pulling me to this
[49:58] half of the church.
[50:01] Somebody's got a burden.
[50:05] Bozo the clown could say that.
[50:12] But prophecy
[50:15] can classify men, women, boys, girls. If
[50:20] God wants to, he can give you a street
[50:22] address.
[50:24] As a matter of fact, tell you your
[50:26] doctor's a heavy set doctor with
[50:28] glasses.
[50:29] three steps going up to your house.
[50:33] It can also be as plain as, "I see you
[50:36] coming home from school one day. You've
[50:38] got a yellow checkered dress on. A dog
[50:41] is chasing you. You fall through the
[50:44] door.
[50:45] It scars you. You've been afraid the
[50:47] rest of your life."
[50:52] So watch now. Shall something come to
[50:53] pass after that I'll pour out my spirit
[50:55] upon all flesh. Your sons and your
[50:58] daughters shall prophesy. Your old men
[51:02] shall dream dreams. Your young men shall
[51:05] see visions. And also upon the servants
[51:10] and the handmmaids.
[51:13] In those days will I pour out my spirit.
[51:18] Now, when the Holy Ghost comes in in
[51:20] Acts chapter 2, you're familiar with it.
[51:23] And whenever the people on the outside
[51:27] see them and they said, "The these
[51:29] people are drunk." But Peter finally
[51:32] gets up and he kind of comes to himself
[51:34] and he says, "These are not drunk as you
[51:38] suppose."
[51:39] Now, he didn't say they were not drunk.
[51:43] He just said they wasn't drunk the way
[51:44] they was thinking they drunk. They were
[51:46] drunk.
[51:49] But this is that which was spoken by the
[51:53] prophet Joel.
[51:57] And Peter could have went on to say,
[51:59] "This day, this scripture
[52:02] is fulfilled."
[52:04] Amen.
[52:05] Now, God of course was pouring out the
[52:09] rain.
[52:11] The rain. Now, listen to me carefully
[52:14] before we pray.
[52:16] There can be a former and a miniature
[52:19] ladder. And you'll watch the prophet
[52:21] when he lays out the church ages that he
[52:24] would say that there come a former reign
[52:27] and then God would send a small rain
[52:30] like at the end of that age that would
[52:32] bring it to fruition.
[52:35] But the reign we're looking for is just
[52:38] not at the end of the leadyan but the
[52:42] end of the gentile era.
[52:46] So, there have been little revivals on
[52:48] down through time, and I believe we will
[52:51] have them myself. Stirrings and
[52:54] revivals,
[52:55] but I'm looking for more than that.
[52:58] I'm looking for the resurrection.
[53:00] Oh, yeah.
[53:01] But until that comes, I'm good. If he
[53:03] wants to pour out one here tonight, what
[53:05] about you all? If he wants to do it, I'm
[53:07] open for it, man. If he wants me to
[53:09] dance, I believe the dancer can come by
[53:12] and I'll dance. But I ain't going to
[53:14] dance just because my brother Harry
[53:15] plays something fast on the organ.
[53:17] I want the dancer to dance through me.
[53:21] Amen.
[53:22] So, we are looking with all of our
[53:24] hearts now for Joel 2 to still be poured
[53:29] out because we're living in the time
[53:31] frame when Joel went on down a few
[53:33] verses below this and said that it would
[53:35] be an outpouring of the former and the
[53:38] latter rain together. Together. That
[53:41] never happened in the book of Acts.
[53:44] That's prophesied for the last days.
[53:47] That's our day.
[53:48] How many like to be remembered tonight
[53:50] as we pray?
[53:52] Heavenly Father, we count it a great
[53:54] privilege tonight to be gathered
[53:56] together, Lord, once again in the house
[53:57] of God. We thank you, Father, for those
[54:00] that put forth the effort to be able to
[54:02] come. And Lord Jesus, we pray for those
[54:05] that were sick tonight and maybe those
[54:08] that were weary and just couldn't make
[54:10] it.
[54:12] Lord, I
[54:15] I pray for Alicia at home. You see,
[54:18] she's had a really bad day today.
[54:21] Pray that you'd help her. Father,
[54:25] I pray, Lord, that you'd just minister
[54:28] to her tonight.
[54:30] I know
[54:32] many of the church family probably have
[54:34] thought about today and they felt a
[54:36] little bit heavy and all of that. We
[54:39] have, too.
[54:40] But we're so grateful, Lord Jesus, to
[54:43] know that when we come to the end of our
[54:45] life, it's not the end of who we are. So
[54:49] we have great hope tonight.
[54:51] Lord, as I told Lee and Maria today, we
[54:54] are one year closer to seeing Jesus and
[54:58] seeing our Erica again.
[55:00] Well, Father, I pray those of us that
[55:03] are still present and alive. Many of our
[55:06] brothers and sisters has completed their
[55:08] journey and they've went on. We're still
[55:10] here. You know what we need. You know
[55:13] what we'll face. So, we ask you to help
[55:15] us tonight. Father, speak to us. In the
[55:18] name of Jesus, we ask.
[55:20] Amen. God bless you, saints. You may be
[55:23] seated.
[55:26] We know that God whenever he
[55:30] placed the earth in the cycle of what he
[55:34] calls in the book of Genesis seed time
[55:38] and harvest.
[55:40] Seed time and harvest. And remember the
[55:43] book of Genesis, the prophet calls it
[55:46] the seed chapter of the seed book of of
[55:49] the Old Testament. And it means the
[55:51] beginning. But it was also the time of
[55:54] of sewing seeds. And we can see from
[55:58] what took place in the garden of Eden.
[56:00] It gives us an overview of what would
[56:02] happen over and over and over again down
[56:06] through the ages of the Hebrews and then
[56:09] when it come to the uh conversion of the
[56:12] Gentiles and the Lord Jesus dying on the
[56:15] cross of what would start happening in
[56:18] the church ages. So we know what we can
[56:21] expect uh to look for in the harvest by
[56:25] having a pretty good idea of what type
[56:28] of seed is being sown. So you as
[56:32] individuals, you want to know what next
[56:35] week will be for you. You want to know
[56:37] what next month might be, next year, two
[56:40] years from now, three years from now.
[56:42] look at what you're sewing today and
[56:45] you'll have a pretty good idea of the
[56:48] crop you're going to reap. Now, if
[56:50] you're sewing gossip, you might as well
[56:52] expect it. People are going to talk
[56:54] about you. If you're sewing halftruths,
[56:57] you're sewing a crop and there's
[56:59] something about them crops, they always
[57:02] multiply. So if you spread a half-truth
[57:06] about somebody and maybe you only told
[57:09] one person or maybe two or maybe three,
[57:12] don't don't be surprised if somebody
[57:15] tells it something about you and this
[57:18] one tells it, that one repeats it, that
[57:20] one repeats it. It might wind up being
[57:23] 50 or 60 or 70. And you know where that
[57:27] come from? Don't blame it on the devil.
[57:29] But you yourself actually swed that
[57:32] seed. Now I think if we would take this
[57:35] into deep consideration, it would make
[57:38] us a lot better people and it would make
[57:41] us want to do better. Not only just for
[57:45] the sake of doing better, but it would
[57:47] make our life even better. And even the
[57:50] prophet said himself that praying and I
[57:53] read it to you Sunday a week ago
[57:55] whenever he was talking about the third
[57:57] pull of his ministry and that he said he
[57:59] prayed that God would let it be
[58:02] something that would help suffering
[58:05] humanity that it might be able to help
[58:08] pe people be more healthy and more
[58:11] happy. And you think, wow. So, he didn't
[58:14] just want people to be more spiritual,
[58:17] but he actually wanted hoped that God
[58:19] would give him something that would help
[58:22] people to be a little bit more happy in
[58:24] life. I wonder what kind of PE church we
[58:27] would be if we took that as our desire,
[58:30] our motive, not just to bring people to
[58:32] our opinion about things and our
[58:35] ideology about things, but if we could
[58:37] just say something that would maybe lift
[58:40] a person when they're down, just look
[58:43] for the opportunity to be able to if you
[58:45] see somebody, they got a frown on their
[58:47] face and be able to say a little
[58:49] something that'll make them just a
[58:51] little bit more cheery. I went through
[58:53] Burger King here not long ago and
[58:56] they've changed their little sayings,
[58:57] you know how they do. So I pulled up
[58:59] into the drive-thru and the woman that
[59:02] was deal with her deal, you know, and
[59:04] she said, "You're at Burger King where
[59:07] you rule." And I said, "I would like a
[59:09] large drink." She said, "I'm sorry, sir.
[59:12] We're out of large cups." I said, "So in
[59:15] other words, I don't rule after all, do
[59:17] I?"
[59:20] So that woman busted out of laughing. I
[59:23] come up to the drive-thru and there was
[59:25] an old lady there waiting waiting on me
[59:26] and she said, "Was that you that just
[59:28] said that?" I said, "Yes, ma'am." She
[59:30] said, "I'll remember that all day." When
[59:32] I went up to the window to pick up my
[59:34] mediumsized drink, they was laughing in
[59:37] there. They was waving at me. And I
[59:39] thought, "Poor old things get cussed
[59:41] out. They get jumped on." You know how
[59:44] it is. And you know how it ought to be
[59:47] the desire of every child of God to try
[59:51] to help not just your family, not just
[59:54] those in our home church, but anybody
[59:57] that you come across in your life that
[1:00:00] you might be able to say a kind word to
[1:00:03] lift them up. Come on, somebody. Now if
[1:00:06] it if that happens that way in the
[1:00:08] natural sense then what about spiritual
[1:00:12] multiplication of the word and what God
[1:00:16] has done down through the ages. Now we
[1:00:18] know it's a law of God that seed will
[1:00:22] come forth. Now I come by the the church
[1:00:24] here today and one I did. I saw a couple
[1:00:27] of guys out there in the field and one
[1:00:30] of them was driving sitting here tonight
[1:00:32] a gasoline or propane whichever it was
[1:00:35] operated aiator. Anybody know what that
[1:00:38] is? Some of you do, some of you don't.
[1:00:39] It's a machine which you stand up on the
[1:00:42] back of it and it goes over the dirt and
[1:00:44] it makes holes in the dirt. Then there
[1:00:47] was another guy standing out there with
[1:00:50] all kinds of grass seed. Now I wonder
[1:00:52] where in the world they got that
[1:00:55] instruction to sew that field over
[1:00:57] there. Reckon where that come from? I
[1:01:00] imagine it's the Sunday school teachers.
[1:01:02] Reckon Imagine it must have been the
[1:01:04] sound guys upstairs. It must have been
[1:01:07] maybe uh maybe some of you all that
[1:01:10] wanted the field to look more plentiful.
[1:01:14] You're looking at the guy right now
[1:01:17] because God made that field and we
[1:01:21] helped level it out, but there's so many
[1:01:24] bare spots in that field. I can't take
[1:01:27] no more of it. I want it to be full of
[1:01:31] grass. And that's the way I look at you.
[1:01:33] If I see a bare spot in your life here
[1:01:36] and a bare spot there, I think all that
[1:01:38] good ground's going to waste. So let me
[1:01:41] teal you up a little bit. Let me ariate
[1:01:45] your hide. Let me punch holes in you if
[1:01:49] need be. And then I'll come behind and
[1:01:51] sew down a little bit of Acts 2 and a
[1:01:54] little bit of Acts 4 and a little bit of
[1:01:56] Ephesians 1:3 and a little bit of
[1:01:58] Ephesians 2:6. And it won't be long if
[1:02:02] you've got real fertile ground and we
[1:02:04] can have another element called
[1:02:06] moisture. I will see you a more fruitful
[1:02:09] Christian than you were six months ago.
[1:02:12] Amen.
[1:02:13] Ain't that what we want to be?
[1:02:15] So then we know that the seed as
[1:02:17] powerful and potent as it is, the seed
[1:02:21] by itself cannot come up without an
[1:02:24] element of moisture. Now I love this the
[1:02:27] way the prophet deals with it in the
[1:02:29] spoken word again. He says, "A seed must
[1:02:32] have water to grow." Now, you put a seed
[1:02:35] in the ground and if there's no moisture
[1:02:38] in the ground, it's dust and it won't
[1:02:41] grow in the dust. Okay? It's got to have
[1:02:44] a certain percent of moisture or it
[1:02:47] won't grow. Now, we know the seed is the
[1:02:50] word. How many knows what the moisture
[1:02:52] is?
[1:02:54] How many knows?
[1:02:55] Say it. Spirit.
[1:02:57] Moisture is not the music.
[1:03:00] Moisture is not the musicians. Moisture
[1:03:03] is not deacons, trustees, Sunday school
[1:03:05] teachers. Moisture is not the preacher.
[1:03:07] But moisture is the spirit of God. And
[1:03:11] this is why we always want the spirit of
[1:03:14] God in our lives, in our church, in our
[1:03:18] youth services, even in Sunday school.
[1:03:20] When our kids are going back there to
[1:03:22] Sunday school, we think it's important
[1:03:24] that the Sunday school teachers pray,
[1:03:26] "Lord, please give me something to say
[1:03:28] and help me to say it in the right way."
[1:03:30] You know what they're asking for?
[1:03:32] Moisture. Moisture. That the spirit of
[1:03:35] God will be able to take that and sew
[1:03:37] that in the hearts of our little
[1:03:39] children. Aren't you glad they're doing
[1:03:40] that? So, we need the moisture like
[1:03:44] never before. This message will never
[1:03:47] reproduce itself without the moisture of
[1:03:50] the Holy Ghost. It's got to have a
[1:03:53] certain percent of moisture or it won't
[1:03:55] grow. And he asked the question, is that
[1:03:57] right? The letter kleth the spirit
[1:03:59] giveth life. See now it must have
[1:04:02] moisture to grow. Moisture Baptist
[1:04:06] Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran without
[1:04:10] the water. When he's first converted he
[1:04:13] looks right straight to Christ. He
[1:04:15] believes and the first thing you know
[1:04:17] that denomination binds him into a place
[1:04:21] and the moisture of the spirits gone
[1:04:24] from him. Now, let's bring it on down
[1:04:27] and not just leave it in them
[1:04:28] denomination. But the sad thing about it
[1:04:31] is there's also message churches that
[1:04:33] have done the exact same thing. They
[1:04:35] don't want the Holy Ghost move. They
[1:04:37] don't want a new birth. And they just
[1:04:39] simply say, "Well, if you believe God
[1:04:40] sent a prophet, you got the Holy Ghost."
[1:04:42] I have met thousands of people around
[1:04:44] the world that believe God sent a
[1:04:45] prophet. And they did not have a new
[1:04:48] birth.
[1:04:49] That's right. Prove it by the life they
[1:04:51] live. So, we don't want to just point
[1:04:53] our finger at them and say, "Well,
[1:04:54] that's all toward them." No, it's also
[1:04:56] toward us as well. And if Satan cannot
[1:05:00] stop us in our theology, he'll try to
[1:05:03] stop us in our moisture. So, we come to
[1:05:06] church and we worship without moisture.
[1:05:09] We sing without moisture. We'd sit there
[1:05:12] and we hear the word without moisture.
[1:05:14] So, we sat there with our mouths open.
[1:05:17] Feed me. Feed me. Feed me. Feed me. Feed
[1:05:20] me. Feed me, feed me, feed me.
[1:05:23] But you are supposed to add moisture
[1:05:26] back to that word by saying,
[1:05:30] "Ah, yeah, that's your part." You see,
[1:05:33] so you're watering it. Remember the
[1:05:35] prophet said that Abraham watered that
[1:05:37] promise of God every day with praise. So
[1:05:41] praise is water. So this is why I don't
[1:05:45] want to pump you up. I'm not trying to
[1:05:47] make you praise. I want you to do it on
[1:05:50] your own. But you know what? Sometimes
[1:05:52] if I need to remember I used to drink
[1:05:55] out of a system when I was a boy and we
[1:05:57] had one of them old sucker pumps out on
[1:05:59] the back porch. That's what they call
[1:06:01] it. I had to change that gasket many a
[1:06:04] time. And that old sucker pump, you go
[1:06:06] out there and you go to pumping like
[1:06:07] this. And boy, I'll tell you, I found a
[1:06:09] trick early on. if you can't get it to
[1:06:12] come up cuz that pipe went way down in
[1:06:14] that system. You'd have to pour a little
[1:06:16] bit of water to prime that baby. So
[1:06:19] you'd stand there and you go to pumping
[1:06:21] like this and you'd prime it. Well, you
[1:06:23] know what? Sometimes the service leader
[1:06:25] looks at you all and you look like the
[1:06:27] Sahara. You're so dry that a scorpion
[1:06:30] wouldn't even sat down by you in a chair
[1:06:32] and he knows he's got to do a little
[1:06:34] bit. Well, brother Lou, he's trying to
[1:06:36] pump. Yeah, he is. Brother Aaron's
[1:06:39] trying to pump you. Brother Justin,
[1:06:40] whoever trying to pump you out. And if
[1:06:42] they didn't, you'd look like Sahara in
[1:06:45] the song service. You look like the
[1:06:47] Sahara in the preaching service and you
[1:06:49] look like the Sahara when you went out.
[1:06:52] You may look like Sahara when you come
[1:06:54] in, but I want you to look like Woga
[1:06:57] Lake when you go out. I want you, oh,
[1:07:00] glory to God. I want you to look like
[1:07:02] you have been to church. I want you to
[1:07:05] turn that frown of yours upside down and
[1:07:09] say, "I have got so much to thank him
[1:07:12] for. He has saved me. He has healed me.
[1:07:16] He has delivered me. He has moved for
[1:07:19] me." You've got so much to praise him
[1:07:21] for.
[1:07:26] Oh my.
[1:07:29] Now watch the first thing you know. the
[1:07:30] denominational binds him into that place
[1:07:33] and the moisture of the spirit's gone
[1:07:35] from him, he becomes denominational and
[1:07:37] he's dead. I wonder if that can't happen
[1:07:40] in our ranks
[1:07:42] that we become denominational
[1:07:46] by the way we worship. Still baptized in
[1:07:48] the name of Jesus Christ. Still believe
[1:07:50] in serpent seed. Believe women can't
[1:07:52] preach. Believe they shouldn't do this,
[1:07:53] shouldn't do that, shouldn't do that,
[1:07:55] shouldn't do that. And yet in our
[1:07:56] worship are just as dead as any
[1:07:58] denomination or church ever seen. Oh my.
[1:08:00] Come on.
[1:08:01] Woo Jesus. Here we go.
[1:08:04] Notice Jesus now speaking in Luke 8:6.
[1:08:08] This is the parable of the swer. Some
[1:08:12] seed fell upon a rock and as soon it was
[1:08:16] it was sprung up. Now we think, "Wow,
[1:08:19] man. Plant me on the rock. Plant me on
[1:08:22] the rock." You're mixing your parables.
[1:08:25] Yeah.
[1:08:26] I said you're mixing your parables.
[1:08:29] in this parable to be planted on the
[1:08:32] rock
[1:08:34] is not a good thing at all
[1:08:36] cuz it means you have no depths of earth
[1:08:41] and you know what'll happen the sun will
[1:08:44] dry you out
[1:08:46] cuz you have no depths watch the master
[1:08:49] teacher now the Lord Jesus some fell
[1:08:51] upon a rock and as soon as it sprung up
[1:08:56] it withered away why It lacked moisture.
[1:09:01] So, it jumped up real quick, maybe even
[1:09:04] quicker, maybe even quicker than a seed
[1:09:08] that was laying in the dirt because it
[1:09:10] responded so fast. And boy, it shot up.
[1:09:13] My goodness. Oh, hallelujah. I'm going
[1:09:15] tell you one thing. Oh, glory to God.
[1:09:17] But it didn't have any moisture in
[1:09:19] itself. So, you pull it away from the
[1:09:23] camp meeting.
[1:09:25] pull it away from the special service
[1:09:28] and see how much moisture it's got in
[1:09:30] itself.
[1:09:32] You see, this is the type of Christians
[1:09:34] we want to produce here at our church
[1:09:37] that on those days when you are by
[1:09:39] yourself, you still have moisture. So,
[1:09:42] whenever you don't feel God, you still
[1:09:45] have moisture. When you're going in the
[1:09:47] valley, oh yes, thank God for our
[1:09:49] brothers and sisters. I better express
[1:09:51] that tonight how much we appreciate it.
[1:09:53] But I want to have moisture in myself
[1:09:57] just in case I get caught out by myself.
[1:10:00] I still can fight.
[1:10:03] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:10:05] Now, I want you to listen to this. It it
[1:10:07] it just absolutely I've looked at this
[1:10:09] for, you know, for decades since I've
[1:10:11] come to the message, but it still
[1:10:13] overwhelms me. I've been going through
[1:10:15] again spoken words original seed and end
[1:10:17] time seed sign, which is the next night
[1:10:19] in Tiffan, Georgia. And every time I
[1:10:22] come across this, I just I I I was
[1:10:24] listening to it today. I just had to
[1:10:25] stop and shake my head. He was that seed
[1:10:30] that Eve
[1:10:32] should have produced.
[1:10:34] And again, I heard him say on over in
[1:10:36] this message that Isaiah should have
[1:10:40] come through Eve.
[1:10:44] Isaiah.
[1:10:46] So she had the privilege to give birth
[1:10:50] to Jesus. That's right.
[1:10:53] But instead she gave birth
[1:10:56] to Cain.
[1:10:59] Yes, sir.
[1:11:00] Oh my.
[1:11:02] Do you get it? He was the seed that Eve
[1:11:06] was to produce, but she hired it by
[1:11:09] disbelieving God's word. So he was that
[1:11:12] seed and the only way that life could be
[1:11:15] in the reproduction of life, life had to
[1:11:18] come through that seed. So this is God's
[1:11:21] original plan and planting that Christ
[1:11:25] would have been the seed of God. So she
[1:11:28] could have actually Adam would have
[1:11:30] spoke to her the spoken word and through
[1:11:35] her would have come every son every
[1:11:38] daughter
[1:11:39] would have been a short conceiving time
[1:11:41] would have been one after the other who
[1:11:43] knows I don't know but she should have
[1:11:46] been my mother
[1:11:51] not Betty Jane Reagan
[1:11:53] Eve should have been my mother
[1:11:56] She should have been yours.
[1:11:59] She should have been Isaiah's.
[1:12:02] She should have been Jesus mother.
[1:12:06] Then truly I would have been a blood
[1:12:11] brother
[1:12:12] to Isaiah,
[1:12:14] to Moses,
[1:12:16] sir,
[1:12:16] to Jesus.
[1:12:17] Yes.
[1:12:20] Well, I hope this don't stagger you, but
[1:12:22] I am anyway.
[1:12:26] That's right.
[1:12:27] Now, what she doubted,
[1:12:31] oh, glory to God, what she doubted,
[1:12:35] God allowed another virgin to say, "Be
[1:12:39] it unto me according to thy word." Now,
[1:12:43] he was not going to bring me or you
[1:12:46] through Mary.
[1:12:48] She didn't have to. All she had to do
[1:12:52] was give birth to the second man Adam
[1:12:56] and then the second man Adam would take
[1:13:00] the rest of the births
[1:13:02] on his own self.
[1:13:05] Glory.
[1:13:07] So then this birth would not be
[1:13:10] committed to another woman. He trusted a
[1:13:14] woman there in the Garden of Eden. But
[1:13:16] he said, "I will not trust the birth of
[1:13:20] my children from this point on to any
[1:13:23] other woman." I'm talking about soul
[1:13:25] birth now. But he said, "I will do it
[1:13:29] myself
[1:13:30] who give you your new birth." It was not
[1:13:33] the church. It was not the preacher. It
[1:13:36] was the Lord Jesus himself. Every person
[1:13:39] around the world that is truly born
[1:13:42] again is born by Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:13:47] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:13:51] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:13:53] Notice he said that in the reproduction
[1:13:55] of life, life had to come through that
[1:13:57] seed. And that seed had to die in order
[1:14:00] to spread out the life. And this is part
[1:14:03] of the mystery that he hid from Satan.
[1:14:07] He couldn't see it. He looked right at
[1:14:10] it, but he couldn't understand it.
[1:14:13] You imagine hell they must have been
[1:14:16] rejoicing
[1:14:18] and shouting and carrying on the office
[1:14:21] ever was when he was there on the cross.
[1:14:24] Eli Eli,
[1:14:28] my God, my God, why has thou forsaken
[1:14:31] me? And he thought, we've got him.
[1:14:35] We did it.
[1:14:38] We killed him.
[1:14:40] We have stopped the entire program of
[1:14:44] God.
[1:14:51] Until
[1:14:59] sir,
[1:14:59] it was not FedEx.
[1:15:02] It was not UPS
[1:15:04] or USPS.
[1:15:07] It was the US man.
[1:15:11] our man
[1:15:13] for us.
[1:15:15] You imagine how them demons when they
[1:15:18] went to open that door and the prophet
[1:15:20] said the devil walked up to that door
[1:15:22] and said, "Ah,
[1:15:25] it's you.
[1:15:27] You finally arrived. I thought I had you
[1:15:30] when I had came to kill Abel. I thought
[1:15:33] I got you when I got Moses and went
[1:15:35] through his all of his big deal." He
[1:15:38] said, "Yes, I have arrived and my blood
[1:15:43] is hot
[1:15:44] on Calvary."
[1:15:48] He said, "What do you want? This is my
[1:15:50] house." He said, "I want the keys.
[1:15:55] I want the keys."
[1:15:58] Let me just remind you, the devil ain't
[1:16:00] got the keys to his own house.
[1:16:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:07] Oh my. You imagine when the Lord Jesus
[1:16:10] stepped down there and it hit him.
[1:16:13] Oh my god.
[1:16:15] What have I done?
[1:16:19] You're mean. He tricked me.
[1:16:23] He tricked me. How could you do this to
[1:16:27] me?
[1:16:29] You knew I would fall for it.
[1:16:32] A dumb devil.
[1:16:35] Oh my, the Lord Jesus. Oh, I love the
[1:16:39] way the prophet said he slammed that
[1:16:41] door shut, took his foot and kicked it.
[1:16:44] Everything on the walls of hell fell
[1:16:46] off. The devil was 6 months picking up
[1:16:49] pictures and selfies. You know how he
[1:16:50] is. Had selfies all over the walls of
[1:16:52] hell down there. And the Lord Jesus
[1:16:54] kicked every one of them off. Hey, I am
[1:16:58] the seed of the woman. I'm the one that
[1:17:01] Abraham spoke about. I have a right.
[1:17:04] Give me the keys.
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:13] I imagine for six months the devil was
[1:17:16] in the foulest mood them demons had ever
[1:17:18] seen him in their life. They all tiptoed
[1:17:22] around him. You know, don't go near him.
[1:17:23] He's so mad. He's so aggravated. Jesus
[1:17:27] said, I ain't worried about you. You're
[1:17:28] defeated. As far as I'm concerned, I've
[1:17:30] got a little bit of delivery over here
[1:17:32] for my young ones because paradise was
[1:17:35] right down there in that downward realm
[1:17:37] and he was heading right over there. Oh
[1:17:39] my. He went over and knocked on that
[1:17:41] door to see who come to the door and
[1:17:43] said, "My Lord, there's the one I saw
[1:17:46] that was a wheel in the middle of the
[1:17:48] wheel and Jeremiah come up and
[1:17:50] Zachchariah all the saints and the
[1:17:53] prophets of God and Abraham said, "Move
[1:17:55] way. Move way. Let me see." And Sarah,
[1:17:58] Sarah, here he is. He's the one we saw
[1:18:00] that day down at the tent.
[1:18:04] Oh, he said, "Children,
[1:18:06] I've come for you."
[1:18:13] Imagine the devil's old bottom lip all
[1:18:16] pooched out. I can't believe. I thought
[1:18:20] I knew everything. I thought I knew
[1:18:22] everything. I read that Bible. I thought
[1:18:25] I knew everything he's going to do. How
[1:18:27] in the world did he trick me? Why did
[1:18:29] you demons tell me who he was? Why
[1:18:32] didn't you all give me a better
[1:18:33] observation of, well, I can't believe
[1:18:35] you all done this?
[1:18:41] So, you see who people's under their
[1:18:42] influence, they're always blaming
[1:18:44] everybody else for their problems.
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:48] That's the devil that does that. Amen.
[1:18:54] But now it was too late.
[1:19:00] Because Eve's Christ child
[1:19:04] had now spread forth the breaking of the
[1:19:08] birthwater.
[1:19:11] His water broke
[1:19:13] on the cross.
[1:19:16] So water, blood, and spirit. the three
[1:19:20] elements that puts us back in the body.
[1:19:23] You imagine them demons getting on them
[1:19:25] Roman soldiers and they got that spear
[1:19:27] and rammed it right up in his side. Them
[1:19:30] demons anointing them Romans as they
[1:19:32] took that cat of ninetail and beat his
[1:19:35] back. Dumb devil.
[1:19:38] If he' have known it was going to heal
[1:19:39] your cancer and your TB and your asthma
[1:19:43] and your this and that, you think he
[1:19:45] would have done that? He' have had
[1:19:46] band-aids all over the body of Jesus,
[1:19:48] but he didn't know what he was doing.
[1:19:50] Same way with you and I. He makes it
[1:19:53] brag, "Lord, let me do this to him. Let
[1:19:55] me do that to him. I'll make them deny
[1:19:57] you." I told him today, I said, "Hey,
[1:19:59] devil, one year later, guess what? I
[1:20:03] still believe my God's a cancer killer.
[1:20:06] I still believe my God is a healer. I
[1:20:09] still believe, hallelujah, that you are
[1:20:12] defeated by the power of God.
[1:20:16] So devil, you've lost the battle.
[1:20:26] Oh my.
[1:20:28] So instead of her giving birth to this,
[1:20:33] she gave birth to Cain,
[1:20:37] a mongrel,
[1:20:40] part human,
[1:20:43] part beast.
[1:20:46] look different, talk different, thought
[1:20:50] different,
[1:20:53] ridiculed his word seed, brother.
[1:20:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:59] Let me say half brother.
[1:21:01] They shared the same womb,
[1:21:04] shared the same blood flow.
[1:21:06] Woo! Here we go.
[1:21:10] They nursed from the same mother.
[1:21:16] But they had different fathers.
[1:21:18] They were carried about the same amount
[1:21:20] of time. I hope somebody's sharing me
[1:21:22] tonight. My brother, sister, look around
[1:21:24] at where we are. The latter rain is
[1:21:27] fixing to be poured out.
[1:21:29] Amen.
[1:21:31] We can see the end time. We can see
[1:21:33] politics. We can see the world in the
[1:21:36] state that it's in. But let me tell you,
[1:21:38] let's not focus just on the bad tonight.
[1:21:41] But there is some good that is fixing to
[1:21:43] happen. There is a bride seed that has
[1:21:46] been sown and is fixing to come up. Not
[1:21:49] only will you come up, but the entire
[1:21:52] resurrection of the blessed saints of
[1:21:55] God are going to rise when the fullness
[1:21:57] of the power of God strikes this last
[1:21:59] church.
[1:22:02] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:22:05] They realize every man-made system does
[1:22:08] exactly the same thing that Eve did. So
[1:22:10] they had the opportunity, the Lutheran
[1:22:13] had the opportunity to give birth to
[1:22:16] Christ,
[1:22:18] but instead they took only justification
[1:22:22] and formed a system around it. Now let's
[1:22:25] protect this. Let's protect it. Remember
[1:22:29] the prophet tells us in the church age
[1:22:30] book, that's what the devil does to him.
[1:22:32] He'll tell him, "Now let's protect it.
[1:22:34] Let's protect it. Let's watch over it.
[1:22:36] Let's watch over it. Let's do everything
[1:22:38] we can to protect it.
[1:22:41] That's what a lot of the message folks
[1:22:42] think they're doing.
[1:22:44] God watches out for him, his word.
[1:22:47] You ain't got to protect it from this
[1:22:48] and that. Other all kinds of devils will
[1:22:50] try to come into it. That God's got a
[1:22:52] word that the devil cannot hybridize.
[1:22:55] So, it's not just mine and your job to
[1:22:57] protect the word. The word actually
[1:22:58] protects us.
[1:23:00] Oh, sure. We're here to stand for it.
[1:23:01] Amen. I believe all of that. But it's ev
[1:23:03] it's inevitable. Every one of us, if
[1:23:06] time goes on, every one of us are
[1:23:07] replaceable. That's right.
[1:23:09] Every one of us, this message is not
[1:23:11] depending on me living.
[1:23:14] As a matter of fact, I'm depending on it
[1:23:15] to live.
[1:23:16] Well, come on. If time goes on, I'll be
[1:23:19] gone. But Joel, you'll be gone. All the
[1:23:21] rest of you will be gone. And this word
[1:23:23] will live on and on and on.
[1:23:27] Every one of us from the top on down are
[1:23:29] totally replaceable.
[1:23:32] Oh my. Now, watch. He said that's why
[1:23:35] each revival has its own revival where
[1:23:38] it says each generation has its revival.
[1:23:41] God raises him up a man sets him with
[1:23:46] his word and starts him out with a
[1:23:49] message for that age. Now listen to
[1:23:52] this.
[1:23:54] And as soon as that man's taken off the
[1:23:56] scene,
[1:23:58] somebody else catches it
[1:24:03] and hybrids it.
[1:24:07] Now, keep in mind, it's not always a
[1:24:09] preacher.
[1:24:10] Sometimes it's business people.
[1:24:13] Got a lot of them around the message for
[1:24:14] sure, don't we? They feel like, you
[1:24:16] know, they have an idea of how it ought
[1:24:18] to go. Preachers have a hard enough
[1:24:20] time, much less people they ain't even
[1:24:21] called to handle the word.
[1:24:22] That's right. Now watch the pattern that
[1:24:25] God gets a man and he starts him out for
[1:24:27] the message for that age. And as soon as
[1:24:29] that man's taken off the scene, somebody
[1:24:32] else catches it and hybrids it. Each
[1:24:36] generation has its own revival. It gets
[1:24:38] a chance at the word. Then they hybrid
[1:24:40] it instead of taking on and they go
[1:24:44] somewhere else.
[1:24:47] Now remember there were four death
[1:24:49] messengers that cut down that original
[1:24:52] planning from Acts two. Four death
[1:24:56] messengers. Then there will be four life
[1:24:59] messengers that will come and restore
[1:25:02] it. Remember we've been through it many
[1:25:04] many times. And there will be increments
[1:25:07] of time that God will let out certain
[1:25:10] things of his word. Now remember
[1:25:12] whenever God does it that way that God
[1:25:15] sends say first stage and then God sends
[1:25:18] the second stage but he does not send
[1:25:20] the second stage to replace or do away
[1:25:25] with the first.
[1:25:26] It's actually the first one of the true
[1:25:30] merges in to the second.
[1:25:32] So Lucer come with what? The just shall
[1:25:36] live by faith. Amen. Now whenever God
[1:25:40] said that it was there for many many
[1:25:41] years but God had another word which was
[1:25:44] what? Sanctification. Is that right? Now
[1:25:47] when the Methodists believed that they
[1:25:50] could get sanctified did they all say we
[1:25:53] don't believe in justification no more?
[1:25:55] No.
[1:25:56] Actually believing in justification led
[1:26:00] them to the further stage of
[1:26:02] sanctification.
[1:26:04] So the true believers went from stage
[1:26:07] one, but they didn't say, "I don't need
[1:26:09] to be justified no more." But they
[1:26:11] actually merged from justification to
[1:26:15] sanctification. Now, what were the
[1:26:16] Methodist? The prophet uses the term
[1:26:18] several times. They were shouting
[1:26:20] Methodist. Now, for those of you who
[1:26:23] believe that shouting started with
[1:26:25] Pentecost, you need to catch up on your
[1:26:28] history
[1:26:29] because actually shouting started in the
[1:26:32] Methodist church.
[1:26:35] Oh, you didn't know that?
[1:26:39] It was the Methodists that started
[1:26:41] shouting. Now, I guess the only shouting
[1:26:44] that most mess do anymore is with their
[1:26:46] mouths,
[1:26:48] shouting the preacher down and shouting
[1:26:49] about this and shouting about that. But
[1:26:51] actually it was a move of God under
[1:26:54] sanctification. And they started
[1:26:56] shouting and they would pass out in the
[1:26:59] floor and they would get handkerchiefs
[1:27:01] and fan them like that. They would
[1:27:03] actually get buckets of water. And am I
[1:27:06] telling y'all? Some of y'all didn't know
[1:27:07] really
[1:27:09] because they thought they passed out. So
[1:27:12] they would pour water in their face.
[1:27:14] Carol remembers one of the few times
[1:27:15] that she ever went to church because her
[1:27:18] grandfather was a preacher. I've told
[1:27:19] you before. circuit writer, preacher,
[1:27:21] and they took her one time to a Baptist
[1:27:24] church. How old was she? 8 or 10 years
[1:27:25] old, maybe something like that. She went
[1:27:27] one time and it was the Gap Creek
[1:27:29] Baptist Church, Harry. Right down below
[1:27:31] where we live. And it was a Baptist
[1:27:33] church, but she said she remembers all
[1:27:35] them Baptist women having on skirts.
[1:27:39] Well, tell me, my goodness, all them
[1:27:42] women had on skirts and they had long
[1:27:45] hair and they had the office shouting,
[1:27:47] "Meet there was in that Baptist church."
[1:27:49] And Carol remembered as a little girl
[1:27:52] that one time that she went, she
[1:27:54] remembered walking out of that church
[1:27:56] building, seeing bobby pins laying all
[1:27:59] over the pews and all over the floor in
[1:28:02] a Baptist church.
[1:28:04] Ain't that something? So, what was it
[1:28:07] then? them part of them had been able to
[1:28:10] immerse into the moo of the Methodist
[1:28:13] move. So John and Charles Wesley and
[1:28:15] some of those other brothers whenever
[1:28:17] they got free from their habits, the
[1:28:19] spirit of God took them a dip deeper
[1:28:22] than justification and they got into a
[1:28:25] place of praise and worship and started
[1:28:28] shouting. My goodness, it it's really
[1:28:30] sad to me that we don't think that we
[1:28:32] ought to have a little move of that
[1:28:33] oursel every now and then.
[1:28:34] [Applause]
[1:28:36] Well, hallelujah. Now, watch. Now, I
[1:28:39] want you to notice this that as it comes
[1:28:42] from Luther to Wesley. Then it comes to
[1:28:46] the third stage, which is Pentecost.
[1:28:49] Isuza Street. Well, familiar with it.
[1:28:51] Then along came the Pentecostals with
[1:28:55] the restoration of the gifts.
[1:28:59] I've been looking at this this week to
[1:29:00] see how many times that the prophet used
[1:29:03] this term to identify the Pentecostal
[1:29:08] message. And he uses it over and over
[1:29:13] and over again from the 40s right on to
[1:29:16] the end in 1965.
[1:29:18] So Pentecostal's message, the summation
[1:29:21] of it was that it was the baptism, but
[1:29:25] it was also the restoration of gifts.
[1:29:27] Oh, we got justification, then we got
[1:29:30] sanctification, then Pentecost message
[1:29:33] was the baptism of what they call the
[1:29:36] Holy Ghost and the restoration of gifts.
[1:29:41] Come on.
[1:29:42] Huh.
[1:29:44] But as I started looking at this and I
[1:29:46] thought, well, that seems kind of odd to
[1:29:48] me that some of the message people are
[1:29:52] focusing more in the last days seem like
[1:29:55] on the third message than they are their
[1:29:58] own. Right.
[1:30:02] And in my searches of Malachi 4, Luke
[1:30:04] 17:30, Revelation 10:1-7, and tried to
[1:30:07] associate that with the restoration of
[1:30:10] gifts, I was surprised that the prophet
[1:30:13] placed the restoration of gifts under
[1:30:15] the Pentecostal message.
[1:30:17] That's right, sir.
[1:30:19] Amen, brother Donnie.
[1:30:22] Oh, praise the Lord. I love the way he
[1:30:25] brings this together. Now then along
[1:30:26] came the Pentecostals with the
[1:30:28] restoration of gifts. And you spoke with
[1:30:30] tongues and you made a doctrine out of
[1:30:33] that. Oh, you spoke with tongues and you
[1:30:37] made a doctrine out of that. Then what
[1:30:39] happened? Your lights gone out. What's
[1:30:41] the matter? It's because you failed to
[1:30:44] stay with the word. Oh my goodness. So
[1:30:46] these people had went in the light of
[1:30:49] the day. But then when the light moved
[1:30:51] on, they said, "No, we ain't save no
[1:30:53] prophet. There ain't no way in the world
[1:30:54] we're believing no prophet. We don't
[1:30:56] even believe in prophets. Bible
[1:30:57] belonging the prophets aren't under
[1:30:58] John. You're quoting that scripture to
[1:31:00] prove there ain't no prophets. You make
[1:31:01] the New Testament fight itself.
[1:31:03] According to the book of Acts, prophets
[1:31:05] there among the Gentiles, Sylvanius,
[1:31:07] Agabus on down through there. Paul even
[1:31:09] talked about in Corinthians. Come on
[1:31:10] have church. Can anybody say amen with
[1:31:12] me? Y'all happy?
[1:31:15] Amen. Now watch. He said your light's
[1:31:18] gone out. What's the matter? It's
[1:31:19] because you failed to stay with the
[1:31:21] word. God's words were unfolding and we
[1:31:26] must unfold.
[1:31:28] As God's word unfolds, as time unfolds,
[1:31:33] signs unfolds. Oh, praise the Lord. So,
[1:31:37] it unfolded into justification, but that
[1:31:40] was not the final fold. Then it unfolded
[1:31:43] into sanctification. Then it unfolded
[1:31:45] into the restoration of the gifts. Yeah.
[1:31:49] But is that the last fold?
[1:31:56] Former and latter reign in Phoenix. The
[1:31:58] first reformation was Luther. We had a
[1:32:01] great big wide place. Justification by
[1:32:04] faith. The church was shook. Then came
[1:32:08] along Wesley. The second big revival
[1:32:12] shook it down to sanctification.
[1:32:14] The church becoming the minority. Now
[1:32:16] remember he's talking about the
[1:32:18] symbolism in the form of a pyramid. The
[1:32:20] church become into a minority greatly in
[1:32:23] the minority. Then after that come
[1:32:26] Pentecost
[1:32:28] the restoration of the gifts. It shook
[1:32:31] it down now to just a little thing like
[1:32:34] a pyramid coming up. But right at the
[1:32:38] end time before the capstone can come to
[1:32:40] the pyramid. What about it? What is it?
[1:32:44] Then the church is really in the
[1:32:47] minority.
[1:32:48] Okay. So starts out wide with Luther.
[1:32:51] Then Wesley come in fewer people
[1:32:53] believing it. Come in with a restoration
[1:32:55] of gifts. Fewer people believing it.
[1:32:57] Comes up right under the capstone
[1:33:00] itself. Now it must be honed down to
[1:33:04] where whatever's on the earth here will
[1:33:07] fit the capstone when it comes down.
[1:33:10] Only the master builder knows how big
[1:33:12] the capstone is. Now remember the
[1:33:15] capstone is actually a mini pyramid
[1:33:19] itself.
[1:33:20] So it's just a little te. But the
[1:33:23] capstone is not shaped like a circle.
[1:33:26] The capstone is not shaped like a
[1:33:28] rectangle or a box or a square. The
[1:33:31] capstone is a mini pyramid itself. And
[1:33:35] it has a little T90 base at the bottom.
[1:33:39] So, do you think God is going to cap off
[1:33:42] the last day church and a capstone say
[1:33:45] the base is going to be that wide and
[1:33:47] then the top of the last age is going to
[1:33:49] be that wide. And God miscalculated the
[1:33:52] measurement.
[1:33:54] God did not know how to build a church
[1:33:57] or the capstone is going to be ginormous
[1:33:59] and we've got it narrowed down where
[1:34:01] it's our church and just maybe two or
[1:34:02] three more and that's it cuz we're the
[1:34:04] only bride left. I mean, this is the
[1:34:06] bride's revival, man. alive. They ain't
[1:34:08] heard of about maybe 50 or 75 of us.
[1:34:10] That's all. You You're not listening to
[1:34:12] the master builder.
[1:34:14] Come on, somebody. He's the only one
[1:34:16] that knows. And I've done figured out a
[1:34:18] long time ago. I do a good job just been
[1:34:20] able to fulfill my position, much less
[1:34:22] want to take God's place. I know there's
[1:34:24] a lot of folks feel like they could do
[1:34:25] God's job and they like to give God a
[1:34:27] break because they feel like they can
[1:34:29] run the universe, the earth, everything,
[1:34:30] the church and all, and they just feel
[1:34:32] like they could just help God out a
[1:34:34] little bit. But myself, I'm ignorant,
[1:34:36] stupid, all that sort of thing. But
[1:34:38] you're dumb as a doornail. If that's
[1:34:39] what you think about yourself, you're
[1:34:41] dumber than a jack rabbit. I'll tell you
[1:34:43] that right now. Because there's only one
[1:34:45] God. Come on, somebody. There's only one
[1:34:48] omnipotent. There's only only one that's
[1:34:50] all powerful. And the rest of us ought
[1:34:52] to just be glad to know him.
[1:34:54] That's right.
[1:34:56] Amen.
[1:34:58] Woo. Notice this. Now, now the Oh, I
[1:35:02] love this. The church is really in the
[1:35:04] minority as it was in the days of Noah.
[1:35:07] So coming up the walls of the pyramid,
[1:35:09] they're getting more like this, more
[1:35:11] like this, more like this. What's going
[1:35:13] to separate them? Will it be a jump?
[1:35:15] Will it be an emotion? Will it be a
[1:35:16] shout? Will it be this doctrine? It'll
[1:35:18] be predestination, my brother.
[1:35:22] Oh yes.
[1:35:24] As it was in the days of Noah, so will
[1:35:26] it be in the coming of the son of man,
[1:35:28] where eight souls were saved by water.
[1:35:31] Now the coming of the son of man, what
[1:35:34] is it?
[1:35:35] Listen. The coming of the son of man,
[1:35:40] what is it? The church come from
[1:35:43] justification,
[1:35:45] sanctification, baptism of the holy
[1:35:48] spirit. Now both former and latter rain
[1:35:52] come in. As it close approaching, as my
[1:35:55] hand is a shadow, it becomes closer,
[1:35:59] darker, darker, darker. Hand and shadow
[1:36:05] become the same.
[1:36:08] You can't see my hand from where you
[1:36:10] are. You can see this, but you can't see
[1:36:12] the shadow on the this top of the pull
[1:36:15] pit here. But as I lower it down, it's
[1:36:18] becoming darker and darker and darker
[1:36:21] until the shadow and the hand become the
[1:36:24] same thing.
[1:36:26] But watch what's going on this way. Now
[1:36:28] people have got it in their mind, not a
[1:36:31] pyramid at all, but some sort of
[1:36:33] colossal shape that has started out like
[1:36:36] this, and this is the way they've got
[1:36:37] it. It's getting bigger and bigger and
[1:36:39] bigger and bigger. The whole world,
[1:36:41] everybody around the world, millions
[1:36:43] times millions. Oh, it's getting bigger
[1:36:45] and bigger and bigger.
[1:36:47] We're not playing golf.
[1:36:49] That's right.
[1:36:50] So, you set a golf on that little T90T
[1:36:52] and then you hit off the top of it. God
[1:36:54] ain't building a golf course.
[1:36:56] No, sir.
[1:36:57] He's building a pyramid.
[1:36:58] And it's getting smaller and smaller and
[1:37:01] smaller.
[1:37:03] That's right.
[1:37:05] Well, to be honest with you, I don't
[1:37:06] care how small it gets, I'm in it.
[1:37:10] If ain't but 500 left. I'm not sure who
[1:37:12] the hund other 499 are, but make way.
[1:37:15] Here comes Donnie.
[1:37:16] And if you ain't got that same
[1:37:17] revelation, you ought to say, "Brother
[1:37:19] Donnie, now wait a minute. If ain't but
[1:37:20] one had a word of life going, my
[1:37:22] brother, I'm sorry. You better move cuz
[1:37:23] it is me."
[1:37:25] You ought to be that convinced of what
[1:37:26] God has done in your life and you are so
[1:37:29] much a miracle that you know the rapture
[1:37:32] cannot happen without you.
[1:37:34] Amen.
[1:37:35] Anybody feel that way tonight? Amen. Now
[1:37:39] watch. So the shadow becomes darker and
[1:37:41] darker. Watch it lies in the meal
[1:37:43] offering. That during the days of
[1:37:44] Lucifer, we live by justification.
[1:37:46] During the days of Wesley, we live by
[1:37:48] sanctification. The church become in the
[1:37:50] minority. In the days of Pentecost, we
[1:37:53] live down through the baptism of the
[1:37:55] Holy Ghost and the restoration
[1:37:58] of the gifts.
[1:38:00] Now we're really in the minority coming
[1:38:03] to the son of God. Here they believed by
[1:38:06] faith. Here they shouted.
[1:38:09] Wow. Shouted under sanctification.
[1:38:14] Here they spoke in tongues as a gift.
[1:38:18] But now the negative and the positive,
[1:38:21] the caps coming on the pyramid. It's the
[1:38:24] end time. Listen, children. This is what
[1:38:26] I'm waiting for right here. when the
[1:38:29] Christ
[1:38:31] and his church
[1:38:33] is so much alike
[1:38:36] that it's going to call the dead from
[1:38:38] the Methodist
[1:38:41] the Lucen and all those back there.
[1:38:43] There'll be a resurrection
[1:38:45] that fell asleep in the first, second,
[1:38:47] third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh
[1:38:49] watch will arise one of these days to
[1:38:52] meet Jesus in the skies. The hour has
[1:38:55] arrived, friends. The coming of the Lord
[1:38:58] is at hand.
[1:39:01] So notice then it is more than
[1:39:03] justification. That's we believe in
[1:39:05] justification, don't we?
[1:39:09] Now watch this. Since the days of Lucer,
[1:39:11] they've lived under justification. The
[1:39:13] days of Wesley, they come a little
[1:39:15] higher. The church become in the
[1:39:17] minority under sanctification. They come
[1:39:19] in the Pentecostal move which was the
[1:39:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost or
[1:39:27] the restoration of the gifts.
[1:39:30] Now
[1:39:33] we're going
[1:39:35] just in above that
[1:39:42] to the capstone.
[1:39:46] So it's just right above it.
[1:39:52] So can a person be in the capstone
[1:39:54] revelation
[1:39:56] and deny the move of the spirit of God?
[1:40:00] No, they can't
[1:40:03] cuz that's the age closest to ours.
[1:40:06] They believe and they want a real move
[1:40:09] of God.
[1:40:10] Now they don't want fanaticism because
[1:40:12] they don't think they have to settle for
[1:40:13] fanaticism. That's right. Is that right?
[1:40:15] They love emotion, but they're not
[1:40:17] basing their new birth on emotion. They
[1:40:20] judge their walk by the word, but they
[1:40:22] love it.
[1:40:24] Which watch now? So then come the
[1:40:26] Pentecostal move, which is the baptism
[1:40:28] of the Holy Ghost or the restoration of
[1:40:29] the gifts. Now we're going just in above
[1:40:33] that to the capstone. The church, the
[1:40:36] spirit in the church and the spirit
[1:40:39] that's in him
[1:40:41] has got to be
[1:40:44] the same.
[1:40:47] So could Jesus deny real truth speaking
[1:40:51] in tongues? Could
[1:40:54] Jesus Can you imagine Jesus ever saying,
[1:40:57] "Well, I'm sort of the same, but I don't
[1:40:59] I don't really heal people anymore.
[1:41:02] I don't do miracles no more cuz I I just
[1:41:04] I just I I just don't believe in that
[1:41:05] anymore."
[1:41:06] Well, Jesus couldn't do that.
[1:41:08] Amen.
[1:41:09] Can you imagine? Then Jesus sended a
[1:41:11] prophet messenger with a message and
[1:41:13] Jesus saying, "Well, I'll tell you what,
[1:41:14] you message followers, you know what?
[1:41:16] Really really Paul never used that word
[1:41:18] C gene soul and all that. Uh, so I I I'm
[1:41:21] really having a problem with what
[1:41:23] brother Brandham said. Uh, so you're
[1:41:25] y'all exempt from not believing that.
[1:41:31] Hallelujah.
[1:41:33] Amen.
[1:41:34] Must have been pretty important to
[1:41:36] Jesus. He didn't even have his prophet
[1:41:38] to say it till the last few months
[1:41:42] of his life on earth.
[1:41:45] That's right.
[1:41:46] Something's fixing to happen and God
[1:41:48] breaks it loose and lets him see it. My
[1:41:50] children in the last days is going to
[1:41:52] need this.
[1:41:54] They're going to need it.
[1:41:56] Tell them they've got a sea chain
[1:41:59] in their soul.
[1:42:01] Go ahead and say it this way to them,
[1:42:04] William.
[1:42:06] A soul of God that was in God
[1:42:11] before the foundation.
[1:42:13] Amen. of the world.
[1:42:18] Amen.
[1:42:21] Notice from the great first reformation
[1:42:23] in Luther, the church had a wide
[1:42:26] stretch.
[1:42:28] That was still the Holy Spirit moving in
[1:42:30] the days of Luther. I don't know about
[1:42:32] you, I'm looking for true Lutheran.
[1:42:34] Yeah.
[1:42:35] In the resurrection.
[1:42:37] I'm looking for two Methodists
[1:42:39] in the resurrection. Amen.
[1:42:40] I'm looking for true Pentecostals in the
[1:42:43] resurrection,
[1:42:45] but I ain't looking for no 1906
[1:42:48] coming out of this message in the
[1:42:49] resurrection.
[1:42:52] Woo! Lord have mercy. What did I just
[1:42:54] say? I said the truth.
[1:42:56] Amen.
[1:42:58] I'm looking for real 1906 people to come
[1:43:01] up
[1:43:03] in their day.
[1:43:05] But I ain't looking for none of them.
[1:43:08] To come out of the message churches
[1:43:10] still preaching 1906 Pentecost.
[1:43:15] Amen.
[1:43:17] Boy, is the heat up in here tonight or
[1:43:19] is it just me, man?
[1:43:23] From the first reformation in Luther,
[1:43:25] the church had a wide stretch. It was
[1:43:27] still the Holy Spirit moving in the days
[1:43:29] of Luther. Then he come into the
[1:43:31] minority again when John Wesley was
[1:43:34] sanctification.
[1:43:36] Second work of grace he called it. Then
[1:43:38] along come the Pentecost
[1:43:41] restoration of the gifts still narrowed
[1:43:44] down and it's narrowing on now until the
[1:43:48] church and Christ will become one.
[1:43:53] when it does. Listen, children.
[1:43:57] This is not optional.
[1:44:00] This is the Well, we're just in the
[1:44:02] chain of link and there'll be 45 more
[1:44:04] links. We are at the last link.
[1:44:09] This is the last word
[1:44:14] from God.
[1:44:15] Amen.
[1:44:16] To the Gentiles brought to us by his
[1:44:18] prophet messenger. There are no other
[1:44:20] messengers. There are no eighth day
[1:44:23] preachers. There aren't no eighth day
[1:44:25] prophets. We have the last word,
[1:44:29] the last utterance from God
[1:44:31] to bring us to this next thing I'm going
[1:44:34] to reach you.
[1:44:34] Amen.
[1:44:36] Dear Lord Jesus,
[1:44:40] it's narrowing on out now into the
[1:44:42] church and Christ will become one. And
[1:44:45] when it does, the coming of the Lord
[1:44:48] will be and the resurrection of all
[1:44:50] those that sleep in him
[1:44:54] shall rise. It ain't no wonder
[1:44:57] Satan attacks this message
[1:45:00] like never before.
[1:45:06] But let him attack all he wants to.
[1:45:08] He ain't never going to stop it.
[1:45:11] We've got some sharpshooters in this
[1:45:13] word. So go ahead, devil, raise your
[1:45:15] head up. I'll blow your head off. Go
[1:45:18] ahead, devil. Raise up your two so
[1:45:20] ideology. I'll take my double barrel.
[1:45:23] I'll take my shotgun. If I had an Uzi,
[1:45:25] I'd take it. If I had AK-47, I take it
[1:45:28] spiritually. I'll do whatever I've got
[1:45:30] to do. You better look out, devil. When
[1:45:32] I pull open my cape, I've got M80s. I've
[1:45:35] got M90s. I've got grenades. I've got
[1:45:38] quotes. I've got scriptures. I've got
[1:45:39] Hebrew word. I've got Greek words. I got
[1:45:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:44] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. I wish
[1:45:46] somebody would worship God with me
[1:45:48] tonight. I believe God's got some men in
[1:45:50] this last day that ain't scared of the
[1:45:53] devil. They're not scared of the world.
[1:45:55] They're not scared of CNN and NBC and
[1:45:59] ABC or nobody else.
[1:46:06] Huh?
[1:46:13] So, justification
[1:46:15] made way for sanctification.
[1:46:18] Sanctification made way for the baptism
[1:46:22] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:24] The baptism of the Holy Ghost made way
[1:46:28] for the Holy Ghost
[1:46:30] himself.
[1:46:33] Right. Yes, sir.
[1:46:35] Don't you understand the fourth light is
[1:46:38] not the restoration of gifts.
[1:46:41] It's a restoration of the person
[1:46:44] of the son of man himself.
[1:46:47] Yes, sir.
[1:46:48] That's true.
[1:46:49] Hallelujah.
[1:46:50] Satan would love nothing better than for
[1:46:52] us his message people to make a turn out
[1:46:55] here and start back toward the third
[1:46:57] light.
[1:47:02] The third move will never
[1:47:05] produce a resurrection
[1:47:17] now. I'm feeling the third light.
[1:47:22] Oh my.
[1:47:24] Notice when it does, the coming of the
[1:47:26] Lord will be and the resurrection of all
[1:47:29] those that sleep in him shall rise
[1:47:32] looser. Methodist, Baptist,
[1:47:34] Presbyterian, all that's got his spirit
[1:47:36] will rise to meet him in the air. God
[1:47:38] grant that time right away. Even so,
[1:47:40] come Lord Jesus.
[1:47:45] Now watch, this is 1962.
[1:47:48] God is taking the elect
[1:47:52] out of that Pentecostal church,
[1:47:56] that hybrid,
[1:48:03] that hybrid.
[1:48:06] So once Eve
[1:48:08] allowed her womb of her mind and of her
[1:48:11] body to become polluted, God would never
[1:48:16] allow her to bring forth a spoken word
[1:48:20] birth child.
[1:48:26] She forfeited her rights. She typed
[1:48:29] every denominational system
[1:48:32] that once they forfeit their rights to
[1:48:34] give birth to Christ the word and they
[1:48:37] make an organization run by man,
[1:48:39] controlled by man. Come on, children.
[1:48:42] Can't you see whether it's out yonder
[1:48:44] where it's in our own ranks when man
[1:48:45] gets in charge of anything and you go
[1:48:47] here and you do this and you do that,
[1:48:49] we're playing this tape on a certain
[1:48:50] certain day and you go here and you do
[1:48:51] this. Can't you see it's man again? And
[1:48:54] the prophet said, "When you make a man
[1:48:55] your leader, you run out the Holy
[1:48:57] Ghost."
[1:48:58] God wants the Holy Ghost to be your
[1:49:00] leader. Yes, he uses men. Men that are
[1:49:03] full of the Holy Ghost, a man full of
[1:49:05] the Holy Ghost don't want to be your
[1:49:07] leader know how. He's going to point you
[1:49:09] to Christ Jesus.
[1:49:16] Oh my
[1:49:18] Lord Jesus.
[1:49:20] God is taking the elect out of that
[1:49:22] Pentecostal church, that hybrid, pulling
[1:49:24] it out and finishing up the word. It's
[1:49:27] got to be so close until the word itself
[1:49:31] will blend
[1:49:33] with this word.
[1:49:37] So Christ, the male portion
[1:49:40] of the word
[1:49:42] down through the church ages have been
[1:49:44] been working on a female portion of his
[1:49:47] own creation.
[1:49:50] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:49:54] Bringing it up higher, higher, higher.
[1:49:57] Not bigger and bigger, but littleer,
[1:49:59] littleer, littleer. Ain't it amazing?
[1:50:02] Gets smaller as it goes higher.
[1:50:04] That's the opposite the way man thinks.
[1:50:06] Man thinks bigger, greater, bigger,
[1:50:08] bigger, bigger, bigger. You know, God
[1:50:09] said, "No, littleer, littleer, littleer,
[1:50:11] higher, higher, higher, littleer,
[1:50:12] littleer. Higher it goes, the smaller it
[1:50:14] gets." Why? Because fewer people want to
[1:50:15] hear it. Fewer people want to live it.
[1:50:17] Fewer people want to walk it. But God
[1:50:19] said, "I'm molding it down. I've got
[1:50:20] this dimension. I've got this dimension
[1:50:22] right here, the pyramid, and I've got to
[1:50:24] make the body right down on the earth.
[1:50:26] And it will be exactly perfect."
[1:50:29] When the headstone sets down on this
[1:50:31] life day, church, there won't be a
[1:50:33] quarter of an inch over on this side and
[1:50:35] a half inch over on that side. Well, God
[1:50:38] measures. Oh, man. Oh. Oh, man. I was
[1:50:42] cutting a leg today on a on a nightstand
[1:50:44] that I'm building for Carol. Oh, I got
[1:50:46] that thing all cut out. Had a 25 and a
[1:50:48] or 22 and a half degree cut on one side,
[1:50:50] 35 degree cut on the other side, and
[1:50:52] then a 90 on the other side. Oh man, I
[1:50:54] had it all perfect, exactly right where
[1:50:56] it's supposed to be. I got my little
[1:50:57] router out there routing it all around.
[1:50:59] That crazy router bit, dug into that
[1:51:02] piece of walnut, took a chunk, plum out
[1:51:04] of the side of it. I'll tell you, one
[1:51:06] thought, "Oh my goodness, all the work,
[1:51:08] all the measuring that I done, you know
[1:51:10] what to do? Make another one." But I
[1:51:13] ain't God. I can't go back in there and
[1:51:16] say, "I will restore, sayeth Donnie."
[1:51:19] Oh, but God said it went down past the
[1:51:22] bark. It went down past the leaves. It
[1:51:25] went down to where there was nothing
[1:51:26] left but a stump. But God said through
[1:51:29] the sin of water. Through the scent of
[1:51:31] water, I will restore, sayeth the Lord.
[1:51:35] Oh, the devil tears out chunks here and
[1:51:37] chunks there. And when he will send a
[1:51:39] click and a clam and he'll divide and
[1:51:41] split the message as he's always done,
[1:51:44] God just keeps them going right on.
[1:51:46] Don't slow God down at all.
[1:51:52] Oh,
[1:51:57] there comes
[1:51:59] the headstone
[1:52:01] crying,
[1:52:03] grace,
[1:52:06] grace.
[1:52:09] Wow. Show you men the headstone ain't
[1:52:10] crying. Gifts
[1:52:13] gifts.
[1:52:16] Seven thunders
[1:52:19] peruse you sir
[1:52:22] return ministry return ministry.
[1:52:26] [Music]
[1:52:27] But grace
[1:52:29] grace.
[1:52:31] Grace.
[1:52:33] Well, if we're going to be crying that,
[1:52:34] I figure that ought to become a pretty
[1:52:36] common part of our vocabulary.
[1:52:38] So, if God offers grace to somebody that
[1:52:40] you think don't deserve it, you might
[1:52:43] need to change your vocabulary.
[1:52:45] This has been my mindset for a long
[1:52:47] time. If God offers grace to people that
[1:52:49] looks like to me, they've crossed the
[1:52:51] line. But I see my God offering them
[1:52:53] grace, who am I to say they can't have
[1:52:56] it? I don't think my God holds eternity
[1:52:59] before people like you would a carrot
[1:53:01] before a horse and say, "I want to
[1:53:03] dangle it before you, but you can't have
[1:53:05] it." That's not my God. That's a
[1:53:08] man-made God. If God offers people
[1:53:10] mercy, who are you to say they can't
[1:53:12] have it? If God offers them healing,
[1:53:15] whether they've got long hair or a long
[1:53:17] dress or if they got on britches and
[1:53:18] bobbed hair and God anoints me to pray
[1:53:21] for somebody, I'm going to do it. And I
[1:53:23] have done it. And I've watched God heal
[1:53:26] him. Why? Because God gives grace to
[1:53:28] whom he gives it to. And it ain't none
[1:53:31] of your business or my business to say
[1:53:33] this one or that one can't have it. Oh
[1:53:36] my. Let God give grace and save as many
[1:53:39] as he will.
[1:53:41] Woo. Praise the Lord.
[1:53:53] Notice
[1:53:55] God's taking from there,
[1:53:58] horning out a bunch to make a ministry
[1:54:01] just exactly like that word.
[1:54:05] Because it's got to fit.
[1:54:09] There's the bride.
[1:54:11] Take her up till you get it. Amen. For
[1:54:13] God said, I will restore it. He's going
[1:54:15] to restore it now by four deaths.
[1:54:18] messengers killed it. Then four life
[1:54:21] messengers were restored. What was the
[1:54:24] first? Martin Luther justification. What
[1:54:26] was the second? John Wesley
[1:54:27] sanctification. What was the third?
[1:54:29] Pentecost
[1:54:31] with the restoration of kiss. Friends,
[1:54:32] he says this over and over and over
[1:54:35] again.
[1:54:37] The Holy Ghost. The baptism of the Holy
[1:54:39] Ghost. What was the force?
[1:54:42] Restoration of gifts.
[1:54:46] What?
[1:54:49] the word.
[1:54:50] Amen.
[1:54:51] But believe it or not, that includes
[1:54:54] justification,
[1:54:55] sanctification,
[1:54:56] restoration of gifts.
[1:54:57] That's right.
[1:55:01] That's why we needed a prophet to tell
[1:55:02] us how to operate them.
[1:55:03] That's true.
[1:55:04] He must have believed before this bride
[1:55:07] left this world there would be a true
[1:55:10] display
[1:55:12] of gifts.
[1:55:13] Yes.
[1:55:15] Not like the ones I saw in Pentecost.
[1:55:18] Hit miss. Hit miss. Hit miss.
[1:55:22] He said there's a preacher called Carol
[1:55:24] out one night
[1:55:26] in Pentecost and told her she had
[1:55:30] cancer.
[1:55:32] She refused it.
[1:55:35] It wasn't true.
[1:55:37] There's another preacher called her out
[1:55:39] and told her she's called to preach.
[1:55:42] Made me fight and mad.
[1:55:45] just teasing.
[1:55:49] Oh, but how I've longed
[1:55:52] to see gifts
[1:55:54] that don't miss.
[1:55:55] Yeah.
[1:55:56] Gifts that can so lay it out. Your name
[1:55:59] is so and so. You know, tell brother so
[1:56:01] and so not to go to his his place of
[1:56:03] business tomorrow cuz there's going to
[1:56:05] be a truck that's going to overturn.
[1:56:07] Watch this and this. Oh, you say,
[1:56:08] "Brother Donnie, that's too hard."
[1:56:10] That's the way Paul taught it in the New
[1:56:12] Testament.
[1:56:13] Amen.
[1:56:15] Then Paul said they you will reveal the
[1:56:17] very secrets of their hearts and they'll
[1:56:19] know God is among you.
[1:56:21] Amen.
[1:56:22] That's real gifts, my brother. I'll tell
[1:56:24] you one thing. I don't care if it's 15
[1:56:26] minutes before the rapture takes place.
[1:56:28] I'd still like to see a real
[1:56:29] manifestation. I've seen enough of the
[1:56:31] other. Come on, somebody. Oh, you Oh.
[1:56:34] Oh, Lord. Brother D. Oh, that tears me
[1:56:36] all the pieces. Oh my my. Why you're
[1:56:38] scared to death of a scarecrow? Why
[1:56:40] can't God who give a perfect gift can he
[1:56:42] operate in a perfect way? If he can get
[1:56:44] people that'll get themsel out of the
[1:56:46] way and don't want to be a big shot
[1:56:47] about this or that or the other. Come
[1:56:49] on, somebody. If God can do that right
[1:56:52] before the bride goes home, why would
[1:56:54] not we want God to manifest himself that
[1:56:56] way?
[1:57:01] Let me close. Some of y'all's the
[1:57:03] happiest you've been since I started.
[1:57:06] Bless your little hearts. You're smiling
[1:57:07] just like a possum right now.
[1:57:10] Yesterday
[1:57:12] losers mana would not work for
[1:57:15] Methodist.
[1:57:17] Methodist mana would not work for
[1:57:20] Pentecost.
[1:57:24] Pentecostal mana will not work
[1:57:28] for today.
[1:57:31] That's right.
[1:57:33] Now, you know, there's things that I saw
[1:57:34] in Pentecost, and I know some of the
[1:57:36] preachers, they go back and say, "Oh,
[1:57:38] no. Here he goes again." Yeah. Here I go
[1:57:41] again.
[1:57:42] Okay.
[1:57:43] But you know what I would watch? I would
[1:57:46] watch a preacher get up and preach and
[1:57:47] maybe be sincere and honest before the
[1:57:49] Lord and preach, you know, everything
[1:57:51] that he knew. Pray, brother, you
[1:57:53] churches all your life. Pray and and do
[1:57:56] everything they knew to do. And people
[1:57:57] would sit there, look at him. Sometimes
[1:57:59] they didn't holler. Amen. Sometimes it
[1:58:00] would, sometimes it wouldn't. And then
[1:58:02] maybe at the end of the service,
[1:58:03] somebody get up, speak in tonesues, and
[1:58:05] say a few words in tonesues. And then,
[1:58:06] you know, somebody jump up and say, "I
[1:58:08] the Lord I'm here and I'm going to do
[1:58:09] this, that, and the other." And people
[1:58:11] would go stark, rave, and mad.
[1:58:15] They would run. They would jump. They
[1:58:17] would scream. They would holler. And
[1:58:20] they say, "Boy, God spoke. God spoke."
[1:58:25] So what was the preacher doing?
[1:58:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:30] Now, you know what gets me is the same
[1:58:33] thing that's happening in message
[1:58:34] churches.
[1:58:35] Oh my.
[1:58:36] So, the preacher will get up and preach
[1:58:37] and preach and labor and preach and
[1:58:40] people will sit there and amen.
[1:58:41] Hallelujah. Really good. Praise the
[1:58:43] Lord. Praise the Lord. And somebody up
[1:58:45] and basically repeat the same thing I
[1:58:47] saw in Pentecost. I the Lord say I'm
[1:58:49] here and I'm going to do this and that
[1:58:50] and the other. Nothing future, nothing
[1:58:52] foretold. And people will take off
[1:58:54] screaming and running and hollering and
[1:58:58] jumping and you say, "Oh, praise God.
[1:59:00] Praise God. God spoke." Well, what was
[1:59:03] God doing the hour and 15 minutes that
[1:59:05] the preacher was up there preaching?
[1:59:11] Yes, sir.
[1:59:11] And we say, "That's what they done. The
[1:59:13] original church. You show me."
[1:59:16] Come on.
[1:59:19] Now, some of you preachers, I'm
[1:59:21] challenging you tonight. either put up
[1:59:23] or shut up. Get off my back.
[1:59:28] Amen.
[1:59:29] I believe running, jumping, screaming,
[1:59:31] hotter, and shouting. But if we was
[1:59:33] going to try to prove it by one example
[1:59:35] in the New Testament church, I want you
[1:59:37] to send me the scripture.
[1:59:39] Yeah.
[1:59:41] Show me where the Ephesians church
[1:59:43] shouted.
[1:59:47] Dear Jesus.
[1:59:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:50] Would it be okay with y'all if I took
[1:59:51] some of that free food over there? I may
[1:59:53] need it after tonight.
[1:59:55] [Laughter]
[1:59:59] Well, show me.
[2:00:02] Show me where they stood up and
[2:00:04] prophesied. And it was a bunch of stuff
[2:00:06] that was no prophecy at all. But I will
[2:00:08] show you where Agabus took the garment
[2:00:10] of St. Paul and said, "Whoever owns
[2:00:12] this, he's going to Jerusalem and this
[2:00:14] is going to happen and that's going to
[2:00:15] happen." He's also the same man that
[2:00:17] stood and prophesied and said a durse
[2:00:19] would come upon the earth. They was not
[2:00:21] standing up and guessing, oh, you've got
[2:00:22] a spirit on you and you've got this on
[2:00:24] you and you've got that on you and none
[2:00:26] of it never come to pass.
[2:00:32] Don't you understand what's happening in
[2:00:34] our ranks?
[2:00:36] Hybridizing,
[2:00:38] crossing 1906
[2:00:42] with this headstone.
[2:00:45] Lord have mercy, brother Joel.
[2:00:47] We're this close.
[2:00:50] And we would want to go backwards.
[2:00:55] And God's prophet said, "If you all will
[2:00:57] trust my understanding of the
[2:01:00] scriptures,
[2:01:02] I'd like to show you how them gifts
[2:01:05] ought to be operated." Then yet
[2:01:06] preachers stand in the pull pit and
[2:01:08] ridicule
[2:01:12] and say, "I know brother Ram said the
[2:01:13] gifts need to be on the shelf, but I'll
[2:01:15] tell you one thing. I don't think we
[2:01:16] need them there." What? You're going to
[2:01:19] exalt your little brain over the top of
[2:01:21] the prophet of God.
[2:01:29] Yeah, it's happening tonight, Lord.
[2:01:35] Truth, brother.
[2:01:36] Look, friends,
[2:01:38] I've come too far now to compromise.
[2:01:41] I done seen what that produces backyard.
[2:01:43] Some of y'all have too. I am not taking
[2:01:46] our church to that mess.
[2:01:50] A preacher told me years ago, he come to
[2:01:53] my church in Kentucky and preach himself
[2:01:54] as off the word. I confronted him right
[2:01:57] in the foyer right after church, right
[2:01:58] in front of everybody.
[2:02:02] He stood in the pre in the pull pit and
[2:02:03] preached things that wasn't right. So I
[2:02:04] just confronted him right there. I
[2:02:06] wanted everybody to hear me. I said,
[2:02:07] "You wasn't saying what the prophet
[2:02:09] said. Prophet said this and he said that
[2:02:11] and he said, "Oh, well." I said, "No,
[2:02:13] wait a minute. You are not saying what
[2:02:16] God's prophet said. Therefore, you're a
[2:02:19] liar."
[2:02:21] Come on.
[2:02:23] Church age booking Christians, that's
[2:02:25] what they done. They call them false
[2:02:27] prophets liars.
[2:02:30] How could they do that? Well, they judge
[2:02:31] him by the word. Well, judge me and
[2:02:33] every other preacher. I don't care how
[2:02:35] much he speaks in tongues, how much he
[2:02:36] jumps. He might soar through the through
[2:02:38] the church with wings on his back.
[2:02:40] If he ain't saying what the word says,
[2:02:42] you better stay with this word.
[2:02:57] Listen.
[2:03:01] This
[2:03:03] is the introduction.
[2:03:07] The headstone,
[2:03:10] the last day, the bride tree, which is
[2:03:12] contrary to all of it. Yet it's the same
[2:03:17] light for
[2:03:20] the matured.
[2:03:25] Lutheran's never matured. Wesleyans
[2:03:28] never matured. Full maturity of fourth
[2:03:30] light. Pentecost never matured. That's
[2:03:33] why there's always something in me and
[2:03:35] all the rest of these that was in
[2:03:36] Pentecost. There's something in us
[2:03:38] longing for more. What was it? Maturity.
[2:03:41] Ready, brother Jack?
[2:03:42] Maturity.
[2:03:44] I could have never come to who I am as
[2:03:47] long as I would stay there. So why would
[2:03:48] I want to go back then and say, "Well,
[2:03:50] I'm in the message now, but I'm still
[2:03:52] eating manner from there." Look, I ate
[2:03:54] chucks every way you could fix them. in
[2:03:57] Pentecost cuz that was the Pentecostal
[2:03:59] message. Right, Lance?
[2:04:01] I ate them right fried, boiled with
[2:04:04] cinnamon and with sugar, reffried,
[2:04:07] microwaved, splinted, boiled, however,
[2:04:10] with eggs, with broccoli, with pumpkin
[2:04:12] spice on the side, every way that sucks
[2:04:15] could be fixed.
[2:04:17] Right.
[2:04:19] But once I started tasting some real
[2:04:21] seed word,
[2:04:24] I don't want no more shocks.
[2:04:26] Amen.
[2:04:27] As a matter of fact, you cannot fix
[2:04:29] them. Oh, delicate enough to even be
[2:04:33] able to get my nose to
[2:04:36] right.
[2:04:39] Wow. Them shucks have got butter and
[2:04:43] cinnamon and honey, but honey, they're
[2:04:46] still shucks and they ain't got no life
[2:04:49] in them.
[2:04:51] Come on, somebody.
[2:04:52] Amen.
[2:04:53] But boy, once I happened into Boaz Field
[2:04:56] one day,
[2:05:00] and he had them messengers up there in
[2:05:02] front of me and they just kind of
[2:05:14] election.
[2:05:17] Here I come along through there just a
[2:05:19] little hungry pup, you know, election.
[2:05:22] Lord have mercy. That's that old false
[2:05:24] doctrine stuff, that old predestination
[2:05:26] stuff. But my little seed J said, "Come
[2:05:29] on, smell it. Come on. It won't hurt
[2:05:31] you. Take a little bite of it." I
[2:05:33] reached in there, got a little bite of
[2:05:34] this. Glory. That's a scripture.
[2:05:36] Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:37] So, there's a preacher come to my
[2:05:38] Pentecostal church and started preaching
[2:05:40] about Brother Brener being a prophet.
[2:05:41] Made me matter in a hornet.
[2:05:44] So, I got my Bible. I thought, I'm going
[2:05:46] to get my Bible and I'm going to prove
[2:05:48] that man's wrong. I got in my Bible and
[2:05:51] proved I was wrong.
[2:05:53] [Applause]
[2:05:56] Oh, glory to God. I hope there's still
[2:05:59] some people left on the earth that when
[2:06:01] the Bible or the message proves they're
[2:06:04] wrong, they can admit it.
[2:06:09] Don't we want to be right, children?
[2:06:14] This is not like that we're going to
[2:06:16] miss a stripe.
[2:06:19] This is not like we're going to miss a
[2:06:20] little ember of glory.
[2:06:23] If we don't have the right message for
[2:06:24] the right day, we miss the rapture.
[2:06:30] So to mix this message with Baptist, to
[2:06:33] mix it with Methodist, with Church of
[2:06:34] Christ, with Pentecost,
[2:06:38] we're hybridizing our diet.
[2:06:41] Remember
[2:06:44] the prophet said by feeding the women
[2:06:46] hybrid food back in the 60s
[2:06:51] it would get to a place women couldn't
[2:06:53] no longer have babies because it was
[2:06:56] changing their shape narrowing their
[2:06:59] hips
[2:07:01] where they couldn't spread to be able to
[2:07:03] give birth.
[2:07:05] So you look at the church the same way.
[2:07:08] Feed them a hybridized diet.
[2:07:10] Right? So they can't give births.
[2:07:14] They can't give births.
[2:07:15] Amen.
[2:07:18] Oh, glory.
[2:07:20] But we want real births around here.
[2:07:25] Brother Donnie, will I jump? Will I
[2:07:26] shout? You may do all the above.
[2:07:29] And then you may be like one of my
[2:07:31] favorite Christians that used to come
[2:07:32] here at our church, Brother Jim Bab. I
[2:07:36] never seen him do a march around
[2:07:37] Jericho.
[2:07:39] I never seen him take a line by the
[2:07:41] beard said haha.
[2:07:44] The wildest I ever seen that man get
[2:07:48] was reaching and getting his
[2:07:49] handkerchief and wiping his eyes and
[2:07:52] shaking his head.
[2:07:56] I do imagine once he entered into that
[2:07:58] new body, he got plumbed beside himself.
[2:08:03] Amen.
[2:08:03] About like old brother Kenneth Yarns.
[2:08:04] Brother Lewis said one night, "Brother
[2:08:06] Kenneth got as wild as a buck in church.
[2:08:08] He was beside himself."
[2:08:11] He raised his hand up about that high
[2:08:13] when they were singing.
[2:08:17] But you know what we do? We say, "You
[2:08:18] got to do this and you got to do that
[2:08:20] and you got to do that. You ain't got
[2:08:21] it. You ain't got it." We're going right
[2:08:22] back where Pentecost was.
[2:08:24] Amen.
[2:08:24] We're doing the same thing. Jesus.
[2:08:29] Amen.
[2:08:30] Let them get born again. Yes.
[2:08:32] Then let God bless them the way he wants
[2:08:34] to.
[2:08:35] Some of them may bring a whole carton of
[2:08:36] handkerchiefs to church. They just cry.
[2:08:39] Glory to God. Others of you wore plum
[2:08:41] out whenever you get gone because you've
[2:08:42] shouted and danced around so much.
[2:08:43] Praise the Lord. I wish we had a few
[2:08:45] more shouters myself. But I don't want
[2:08:47] you to shout because somebody else is
[2:08:49] doing it. I want it to be way God
[2:08:51] blesses you.
[2:08:52] And that's the way God wants you to do.
[2:08:54] Ain't that what we want our church to
[2:08:55] be?
[2:08:56] Individuals.
[2:08:58] Oh my.
[2:09:02] I've got to start this youth camp out
[2:09:04] tomorrow night. So, y'all pray for me.
[2:09:06] I'll get all this John the Baptist gear.
[2:09:11] Any of our youth going over there? Yeah,
[2:09:12] I see the few are. They're probably
[2:09:14] saying, "Oh, dear God, help Brother
[2:09:15] Donnie before tomorrow night."
[2:09:18] Amen.
[2:09:20] Oh, children, my heart,
[2:09:24] my heart aches.
[2:09:26] My heart yearns
[2:09:29] to see people so in love with the Lord
[2:09:31] Jesus
[2:09:33] that they love him more than life
[2:09:35] itself.
[2:09:37] If I can get you there, no matter what
[2:09:39] you'll ever face,
[2:09:41] all hell,
[2:09:42] Amen.
[2:09:42] will never pull you away from Christ
[2:09:44] Jesus.
[2:09:45] Glory. Amen.
[2:09:48] Let's bow our heads together.
[2:09:52] Oh my
[2:09:55] Lord Jesus.
[2:09:58] I pray tonight, Father, you'd help us.
[2:10:03] We believe this to be the truth. Lord,
[2:10:08] we believe in justification.
[2:10:11] We believe in sanctification.
[2:10:14] From a look at some of the churches,
[2:10:16] looks like they need a good dose of it.
[2:10:20] We don't believe that the message comes
[2:10:22] at the end time and say, "Well, do away
[2:10:24] justification, sanctification, the Holy
[2:10:26] Ghost, and the gifts and all that." No,
[2:10:27] that ain't what we believe. We believe
[2:10:30] all of that makes this church.
[2:10:34] But father, we also believe
[2:10:37] that the way Paul separated it, every
[2:10:40] believer will be justified, every
[2:10:44] believer will be sanctified,
[2:10:48] but not every believer will speak in
[2:10:51] tongues.
[2:10:52] For the prophet said, it may fall on one
[2:10:54] one time and never fall on them again.
[2:10:58] But it's amongst
[2:11:00] the believers.
[2:11:02] And what I noticed in Pentecost, the
[2:11:04] same thing I see today, Lord, is that
[2:11:07] there was three gifts that were majored
[2:11:10] on in Pentecost. Tongues,
[2:11:13] interpretation,
[2:11:15] prophecy.
[2:11:17] But according to St. Paul, who wrote
[2:11:19] about the gifts,
[2:11:22] he mentioned nine.
[2:11:26] But I wonder why we don't desire those
[2:11:28] other six.
[2:11:31] Probably some of the message people
[2:11:33] couldn't even name them
[2:11:36] because their main focus is on the least
[2:11:40] gift of all.
[2:11:43] And your prophet defines speaking in
[2:11:45] tongues
[2:11:47] as the least of all of them.
[2:11:50] And yet it has become such a major major
[2:11:53] thing.
[2:11:55] I wonder what Satan is saying before
[2:11:57] your throne
[2:11:59] as he accuses us message people.
[2:12:03] I wonder if he throws it up in your
[2:12:05] face. Yeah, you sent that prophet. You
[2:12:08] sent him down there to restore the word.
[2:12:12] Look at what a bunch of them is doing.
[2:12:14] They're focusing on tongues, focusing on
[2:12:17] interpretation, focusing on prophecy.
[2:12:21] They're preaching it.
[2:12:23] their main stream anymore of what they
[2:12:26] study.
[2:12:29] Their conventions are about it. Their
[2:12:30] meetings are about it.
[2:12:33] You wasted your time, God.
[2:12:36] Sending that prophet to lad all them
[2:12:38] doctrines and all them ideas.
[2:12:41] But we would like to refute that devil's
[2:12:44] word tonight and say, "No, Satan.
[2:12:47] God did not waste his time."
[2:12:49] Amen. For there is a bride in the making
[2:12:52] that's being shaped and molded under the
[2:12:55] ministry of continuing on of this word
[2:12:59] brought by this prophet of Malachi 4
[2:13:02] which you met in one debate after
[2:13:06] another
[2:13:07] and you had to leave the platform many a
[2:13:10] time and go back down to hell defeated
[2:13:14] time and time again. your demons come
[2:13:18] crying back down to hell.
[2:13:20] I imagine they had some real arguments
[2:13:22] and debates cuz they jumped on one
[2:13:24] another and said, "Why'd you tell on me?
[2:13:27] Whenever you screamed out in the
[2:13:29] audience, you reveal me and then they
[2:13:32] just jumped on one another and carried
[2:13:34] on." That's because that's what your
[2:13:36] kingdom is, devil.
[2:13:39] You founded it on a split in heaven.
[2:13:43] So you deserve every argument, I figure.
[2:13:46] But I want to tell you tonight, Satan,
[2:13:48] your kingdom is coming down.
[2:13:51] G.
[2:13:52] And it ain't going to be brought down by
[2:13:54] a mighty Hercules.
[2:13:56] It's going to be brought down by the
[2:13:59] weakest bunch of people
[2:14:01] that have ever lived on this earth.
[2:14:05] Human beings sometimes that can't even
[2:14:07] hold their head up.
[2:14:08] They failed God so many times,
[2:14:11] but they believed this word.
[2:14:14] And in his presence, they are a mighty
[2:14:16] army.
[2:14:18] And Joel prophesied, the same one that
[2:14:20] prophesied what we read tonight, that
[2:14:23] they would be an army that would not
[2:14:25] break their ranks.
[2:14:27] So if God called them to be an
[2:14:29] evangelist, they're not going to say,
[2:14:31] "Well, I want to be a pastor."
[2:14:32] God calls them to be a pastor, they say,
[2:14:34] "I'm tired of dealing with people all
[2:14:36] the time. I want to be an evangelist.
[2:14:38] God called them to be a singer. God
[2:14:39] called them to be a member. They're
[2:14:40] going to find their spot and they're
[2:14:42] going to stay there
[2:14:43] and they're going to fight hell.
[2:14:46] Not only are they going to fight you,
[2:14:47] they are going to defeat you.
[2:14:50] I just thought I'd give you a little bit
[2:14:51] of heads up tonight in case you're
[2:14:54] thinking you're you're leading in the
[2:14:55] polls. Well, let me just let you know. I
[2:14:58] just read the polls today
[2:15:00] and they're still saying you're the
[2:15:02] loser.
[2:15:03] G. There ain't no way for you to win.
[2:15:05] Cuz I read the polls back there in
[2:15:07] Revelation 22 and you're cast into the
[2:15:10] lake of fire. You're destroyed and
[2:15:11] annihilated.
[2:15:13] So we don't go by the polls of
[2:15:14] popularity. We don't go by the polls of
[2:15:17] what you and your cohort say out of
[2:15:19] hell, but we go by the polls of heaven.
[2:15:21] And you are absolutely defeated.
[2:15:24] Praise be to God. Lord Jesus, we worship
[2:15:28] you tonight. right in the face of hell.
[2:15:31] We say tonight that you are a mighty
[2:15:34] conqueror.
[2:15:35] We say tonight that we are part of a
[2:15:38] church of the living God.
[2:15:41] You are not dead, but you are alive
[2:15:44] forever more.
[2:15:46] Lord Jesus, I pray you'd sweep among
[2:15:48] these people tonight. Father, those that
[2:15:51] are sick, bring healing. Those that are
[2:15:53] down, bring encouragement. those,
[2:15:55] Father, that may be low in their spirit,
[2:15:58] may the Holy Ghost, even if they're
[2:15:59] sitting at their home tonight and they
[2:16:01] couldn't even come to church, may the
[2:16:03] presence of God go to them now, Father.
[2:16:05] Hallelujah. May the dove of the Holy
[2:16:08] Ghost flap its wings around their little
[2:16:10] heart and lift them out of that low
[2:16:12] place where they are, Lord.
[2:16:14] Granted, I pray tonight, Father.
[2:16:16] We worship you, Lord God.
[2:16:19] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:16:22] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, how many
[2:16:24] loves him tonight with all your heart?
[2:16:26] Lord,
[2:16:27] can we just raise our hands and give him
[2:16:29] a little love in them?
[2:16:30] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:16:32] Oh, hallelujah. I'm talking about the
[2:16:35] church
[2:16:36] in the book of Revelation.

[2:16:44] through the blood, the flood. She's been
[2:16:47] through the fire.
[2:16:48] But one of these days, she's going to
[2:16:51] move up higher.

[2:16:56] triumphant, oh Lord. And it's built. Oh,
[2:17:00] hallelujah. Who by not by me, not by
[2:17:03] you, not by prophets, but the Lord Jesus
[2:17:06] himself.
[2:17:08] Can we sing it together, Harry? Can we
[2:17:10] worship a little bit before we go?
[2:17:12] Oh, praise the Lord. Now, let's give him
[2:17:14] a little bit of praise and let's water
[2:17:17] this seed that's been sown tonight so
[2:17:19] God can bring out a harvest in our life.

[2:32:14] Even when it rips the hide right off of
[2:32:16] us, yet he loved us enough to tell us
[2:32:18] the truth. And ye shall know the truth,
[2:32:21] and it shall make us free tonight.

[2:33:11] those folks over there. So, I wanted to

[2:33:24] Amen.
[2:33:25] Amen. And I don't want somebody just to
[2:33:26] see Jesus when I stand here, but I want
[2:33:29] my wife to see him. I want my children
[2:33:31] to see him. I want my neighbor to see
[2:33:33] Jesus. I don't care if they ever see me.
[2:33:37] I just want them to see him. Is that the
[2:33:39] way you feel tonight?
[2:33:41] Amen. If that's your desire, he said he
[2:33:44] would give you the desire of your heart.
[2:33:46] Amen. We certainly enjoyed the service
[2:33:47] tonight. Let's let's just bow our heads
[2:33:50] for a dismissal prayer.
[2:33:56] Heavenly Father,
[2:34:01] Lord, sometimes I just
[2:34:05] I just don't know what to say, Lord.
[2:34:08] So listen to my heart
[2:34:12] for it speaks to you, Lord. what my mind
[2:34:14] sometimes cannot comprehend
[2:34:17] to tell you how much we love you and how
[2:34:19] much we appreciate, Lord, all that
[2:34:22] you've done for us.
[2:34:24] For when I was yet a sinner, you died
[2:34:26] for me. I would thank you, Lord. I thank
[2:34:28] you for that, Father. And we thank you,
[2:34:31] dear God, for this word that you sent us
[2:34:33] in this end time, Lord, to show us where
[2:34:35] we're at in time. Lord, when the world
[2:34:38] is staggered in darkness, Lord, yet you
[2:34:40] have come with this great light, Lord,
[2:34:43] to lead us out of the darkness, Lord.
[2:34:45] And we're so grateful for that tonight.
[2:34:48] And Lord, as we leave this building,
[2:34:50] Lord, may we never leave your presence,
[2:34:52] dear God, and go with each one. I pray
[2:34:54] as they travel, Lord, that you would be
[2:34:56] with them. Watch over them on the
[2:34:58] highways, Lord, in the byways, Father.
[2:35:00] Lord, those that would be sick and
[2:35:02] afflicted tonight or may be weary, I
[2:35:04] asked you, Father God. Oh Lord, may you
[2:35:08] come and confirm your word once more to
[2:35:10] their hearts, dear God, for you said, "I
[2:35:12] am the Lord thy God that health thee."
[2:35:15] And Lord, we believe that with all their
[2:35:17] hearts. Thank you, dear God, for brother
[2:35:19] Donnie, Lord, for his life, for his
[2:35:21] ministry. Ask that you'd renew his
[2:35:22] strength, Lord. Be with them as they
[2:35:24] travel down towards South Carolina
[2:35:25] tomorrow. Bless the services there in a
[2:35:27] great way. move among the young people,
[2:35:29] Lord, and touch their hearts. We pray.
[2:35:32] Father, bring us back here Sunday
[2:35:34] safely, Lord, to hear the word of God
[2:35:36] again and be with us, Lord, as we travel
[2:35:38] up to Connecticut to minister this
[2:35:40] weekend. We surrender to you, Lord. May
[2:35:42] you just use us for your glory. We pray.
[2:35:45] Thank you, Lord God, for all those that
[2:35:47] labored to bring supplies to those in
[2:35:49] need and those over there in the
[2:35:50] mountains tonight, Lord, that are cold
[2:35:52] and their homes are gone. Oh God, I pray
[2:35:55] in the name of Jesus,
[2:35:57] may they feel your presence, Lord, and
[2:35:59] may it warm their souls as never before.
[2:36:02] We pray and help us, dear God, to be
[2:36:04] your hands and your feet that they may
[2:36:07] see, Lord, in a great time of great
[2:36:09] despair that you're the God who's in the
[2:36:11] midst of the storm and you speak to the
[2:36:13] wind and it obeys you. We thank you for
[2:36:16] that, Father. Go with us now. We pray
[2:36:19] for we ask these things in Jesus name.
[2:36:21] And the church says,
[2:36:22] "Amen."
[2:36:23] Amen. God bless you saints. You're
[2:36:25] dismissed in the fear of the Lord
[2:36:26] tonight. Sing us happy brother. Sing us
[2:36:29] happy brother. Somebody sing.
