[40:36] Thanksgiving is one of my favorite times
[40:38] of the year because you can just get
[40:40] together with family and enjoy
[40:42] fellowship and yet many will be like the
[40:44] prophet said speaking about Thanksgiving
[40:47] he said now Thanksgiving Day many people
[40:49] today never thought tens of thousands
[40:52] times thousands and millions of
[40:55] Americans eat dinner today in a
[40:57] Thanksgiving celebration with a turkey
[41:00] on the table and never as much offer a
[41:02] blessing or return Thanks now why is
[41:06] that because the Bible says in 2 Timothy
[41:09] 3:1 know this also that in the last days
[41:11] pearless times shall come for men shall
[41:15] be lovers of their own selves Covetous
[41:17] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[41:21] to parents unth thankful and Unholy that

[41:33] Believers I'm so thankful tonight that
[41:35] I'm gathered here with the bride of
[41:37] Jesus Christ and to the believer
[41:39] Thanksgiving is not a seasonal tradition
[41:41] it is not a theme to a Believer
[41:44] Thanksgiving is a way of life to a
[41:46] Believer every day is a day of giving
[41:49] thanks to God for the Bible said I will
[41:52] praise the name of God with a song I
[41:54] will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving the
[41:57] Bible says let us come before his
[41:59] presence with Thanksgiving and Make a
[42:01] Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms and I
[42:05] say tonight as We Gather here let my
[42:07] voice be heard in a proclamation giving
[42:11] thanks not just on a Thanksgiving day
[42:13] but on every day that I might tell of
[42:16] all of his wondrous Works Hallelujah the

[42:40] proclamation on how great our God is and
[42:44] I'd like to say tonight he is there is
[42:46] no God like our God now there's many
[42:49] gods in the world today people make a
[42:51] God out of their job they make a God out
[42:53] of their car there's all kinds of gods
[42:55] but there is no God like our
[42:58] God hallelujah amen there is none like
[43:01] ours the Bible says remember the formal
[43:04] things of old for I am God and there is
[43:07] none else I am God and there is none
[43:10] like me many gods in the world today but
[43:13] there is none like our God he is the
[43:16] true and living God and I am so thankful
[43:21] that the God we serve is not a dead God
[43:24] of
[43:25] stone that we pray to and we cry out to
[43:28] but he has no ability to answer back no
[43:31] ability to heal us no ability to deliver
[43:34] us or a god of someone's imagination I
[43:38] am so thankful tonight that we serve The
[43:41] God Who is able to answer back that you
[43:44] can cry out to our God and he hears your
[43:46] cry and he can answer back

[43:52] is Almighty he is all powerful he is

[44:00] love and I am thankful that we can cry
[44:02] out to him and he hears our cry and he
[44:05] sees our tears and our God has the
[44:08] ability to speak back Jeremiah 33 says
[44:12] call unto me and I will answer thee
[44:16] that's right not maybe not hope so not
[44:19] could be not if you hold your hands
[44:21] right not if you say certain words right
[44:24] that's not what he said he said if you
[44:26] call unto me
[44:27] I will answer thee and show you Great
[44:31] and Mighty things which thou knowest not
[44:34] you think of Jona in the belly of a
[44:37] whale a man who had more circumstances
[44:41] than any person I ever heard of more
[44:43] symptoms than any person I anybody here
[44:46] been swallowed by a
[44:48] fish Jonah was swallowed by a fish but
[44:53] he said I cried out to the Lord the
[44:56] Bible said then Jonah prayed unto the
[44:58] Lord his God out of a fish's
[45:01] belly and I cried by the reason of my
[45:04] Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me
[45:08] out of the belly of Hell cried I and
[45:10] thou heardest my voice I am so thankful
[45:13] tonight for this Revelation if God can
[45:16] hear the prayer of a man in the belly of
[45:19] a
[45:19] whale then surely he can hear our prayer
[45:23] tonight in a sanctuary set aside for
[45:26] service to
[45:29] him oh
[45:31] hallelujah
[45:32] hallelujah amen David said in Psalms in
[45:36] my distress I called unto the Lord and I
[45:39] cried unto my God and he heard my voice

[45:45] before him even into his ears who is
[45:48] like thee Oh Lord among the gods who is
[45:51] like thee glorious in Holiness fearful
[45:54] in Praises doing
[45:57] wonders that's right I am so thankful
[46:00] tonight for the past Wonders of Our God
[46:04] the Wonders that our God performed and I
[46:07] am so thankful knowing that he's the
[46:09] same yesterday today and forever and if
[46:12] he done it then he can do it
[46:14] now amen when he went down to Egypt he
[46:18] brought the children out of bondage he
[46:20] broke their chains he delivered him of
[46:22] their oppression with his mighty hand he
[46:25] delivered him and drowned f Pharaoh's
[46:27] Army in the sea he destroyed Pharaoh's
[46:30] Kingdom when our God went down to Egypt

[46:36] showing he was the one and true God Amen

[46:50] of circumstances in a bondage of fear in
[46:53] a chain of Oppression a chain of
[46:54] sickness a chain of addiction a chain of
[46:57] fear despair chains of Darkness but I am
[47:00] so thankful for this Revelation if God
[47:03] done it once he can do it again and when
[47:06] God comes to your Egypt he breaks the
[47:08] chains of bondage he breaks the chains
[47:10] of Oppression and he sets the captive
[47:13] free when God comes to your Egypt

[48:12] and we don't know who we are but our God
[48:14] doesn't want us to live that way he
[48:16] wants you to know where you come from he
[48:18] wants you to know where you're at he

[52:45] Christ to be slain he wrote your name

[52:52] Life he said and he deceived all great
[52:54] and small so many were church members
[52:56] pretended Christians he deceived all
[52:58] whose names were not written in the
[53:00] church book but in the Lamb's Book of
[53:02] Life when before the foundation of the
[53:05] world God wrote your name in the Lamb's
[53:07] Book of Life by his spoken word and sent
[53:10] Christ the sacrifice to buy to redeem
[53:14] that same group that he wrote their
[53:18] names in the Lamb's Book of Life before

[53:46] you I'm so thankful tonight that we're
[53:49] not feeding on a Creed or a Dogma or
[53:52] some man's ideal the prophet said the
[53:54] angel was not the son of man he he was
[53:56] the messenger from the son of man the
[53:58] son of man is Christ he's the one that
[54:00] you're feeding on you're not feeding on
[54:02] a man a man his words will fail but
[54:04] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[54:07] word of the son of man and I say to you
[54:10] tonight what a Thanksgiving feast that
[54:13] is amen remember remember you are what
[54:17] you

[54:25] tonight for the name of
[54:29] Jesus John was 6 months without moving
[54:31] anyone knows that's subnormal three to
[54:33] four months at the most and here's 6
[54:35] months and he hadn't moved but as soon
[54:36] as she heard that salutation in her ear
[54:39] from Mary another one expecting another
[54:41] one expecting both of them and when Mary
[54:43] said and called the name of the Lord
[54:44] Jesus the first time that name was ever
[54:47] spoken human lips a little dead baby in
[54:50] the womb of its mother leap for joy and
[54:53] John received the Holy Ghost in his
[54:55] mother's womb
[54:56] and began leaping for Joy At The Mention
[55:01] Of The Name of
[55:03] Jesus I'm so thankful we have the
[55:06] revelation of the name of Jesus and if
[55:10] the First Time The Name of Jesus was
[55:11] ever spoken human lims made a dead baby
[55:13] leap in its mother's womb for Joy what
[55:15] ought it to do in a Born Again Church to
[55:18] get Faith for power he said I'm not
[55:20] excited I know where I'm at see but I
[55:22] just get the feeling good sometimes when
[55:24] I go to talking about these things
[55:25] that's right because it's true the name
[55:28] of Jesus Christ has life and when it's
[55:30] spoke with power and Faith there isn't
[55:32] nothing that'll stand in its
[55:35] presence that's exactly right oh sure
[55:37] Sons and Daughters of God every man
[55:39] today knows he can take the name of
[55:41] Jesus Christ and meet any foe any place
[55:44] any time and they will be defeated I've
[55:47] met Witch Doctors I've met Demons of all
[55:49] sort and I've never seen the time but
[55:51] what they bowed to the name of Jesus
[55:53] Christ I tell you Friends when the
[55:55] church lost the name of the power in the
[55:57] name of Jesus Christ that's when they
[55:58] lost it but let me tell you tonight we
[56:00] have not lost the power but that name
[56:03] has been given unto us
[56:05] amen amen is that not true friends what
[56:09] is the bride called Mrs Jesus Christ she
[56:11] takes his name why she's bone of his

[56:21] light of the world is not in the man

[56:30] are not a they try to make us a cult but
[56:33] we are not a cult we are the body of
[56:35] Jesus Christ represented on the earth
[56:39] amen
[56:41] hallelujah At The Mention Of His name
[56:44] when we speak that name upon our lips
[56:46] the dead is raised blinded eyes come
[56:48] open and the lame get up and walk don't
[56:51] you tell me he can't do it I've
[56:53] witnessed it I've seen him do it I've
[56:54] been there when he done it
[56:57] amen
[57:01] hallelujah there's power in the name of
[57:04] Jesus to break every chain to break
[57:09] every chain what did the prophet say
[57:12] when Temptation rounds you gathers
[57:15] breathe that holy name in prayer and
[57:19] watch demons
[57:24] scatter amen see I don't come in my name
[57:27] I don't come in my name I come in his
[57:32] name I'm thankful for that name tonight
[57:36] I'm thankful for the blood that atones
[57:40] for our sins for what can wash away our
[57:46] sins
[57:47] nothing nothing but the blood of
[57:54] Jesus brother is talking about this
[57:56] woman since she was a character police
[57:58] courts records everything a gun mole and

[58:02] woman to be a mother settled down to a
[58:05] good God saved Christian what a
[58:07] difference what did that where

[58:37] get a witness for somebody when we was
[58:39] held in the bondage of alcohol and all

[58:44] Mercy provided a blood for
[58:48] us

[58:55] friends that I had met Jesus and what a
[58:57] difference he made in my life me and I

[59:16] left and a voice spoke to my heart and
[59:18] said I will be your friend there is no
[59:21] friend like the lovely Jesus he'll pick

[1:00:41] could not heal you he's already done
[1:00:44] it and if you can realize if he died to
[1:00:48] save us if he died to for our sins then
[1:00:51] that same by the stripes that was on his
[1:00:53] back was for our healing it took place
[1:00:55] on the same day yes that's right from

[1:01:22] there is a blood that sights the blind
[1:01:26] that heals the sick the lonely finds it
[1:01:30] has the power to free the bound as
[1:01:33] chains they fall up on the
[1:01:38] ground amen I'm thankful for all these
[1:01:42] things tonight and we could go on and
[1:01:44] more and more and spend all night
[1:01:46] talking about things that we're thankful
[1:01:48] for that God has done for
[1:01:52] us and listen to me it's easy to give
[1:01:56] God praise when everything is going
[1:02:01] good when you're on the mountain
[1:02:03] shouting the victory it's
[1:02:05] easy amen it's easy to holler Amen in
[1:02:09] church when you're on the
[1:02:12] Mountaintop sir

[1:02:19] easy to thank him for his
[1:02:22] blessings when you're
[1:02:24] enjoying the blessings
[1:02:27] but what
[1:02:28] about when you're in the
[1:02:32] valley and everything seems like it's
[1:02:36] going
[1:02:37] wrong you're
[1:02:40] sick and you're
[1:02:42] lonely you feel like God is a million
[1:02:45] miles from
[1:02:46] you what are you to do then when the
[1:02:50] doctor's report is so
[1:02:52] negative and our children are so
[1:02:55] rebellious us against
[1:02:57] us what are we supposed to do when we're
[1:03:00] heavy with
[1:03:02] sorrow and bitterness is in our
[1:03:08] marriages when we're battling the
[1:03:10] afflictions of our body that will not
[1:03:12] let go and you constantly have to push
[1:03:15] it back off of you come on now what are
[1:03:20] you to do then yes
[1:03:23] sir it's easy to think God when
[1:03:26] everything's going good and the bills
[1:03:28] are paid and you're on fire and you
[1:03:30] can't wait to get to
[1:03:32] church what do you do when you're so
[1:03:34] sick you can't hardly get one shoe on or
[1:03:38] your back is so bad you have to pray to
[1:03:40] get out of the car what do you do
[1:03:44] then but I want you to know tonight that
[1:03:48] God has given us three Mighty weapons
[1:03:52] for times such as these
[1:03:56] and these weapons are found in 1
[1:03:58] Thessalonians
[1:04:01] 5:116 three weapons that just lays there
[1:04:05] but if you use these weapons it will
[1:04:08] make such a vast difference in your
[1:04:10] lives not so much when you're on the
[1:04:13] Mountaintop but when you're in the
[1:04:17] valley I've been there have you
[1:04:20] yeah amen they're found in 1
[1:04:23] Thessalonians 5:16 the Bible says
[1:04:27] Rejoice ever more yes that means at all
[1:04:31] times it means always yeah
[1:04:35] Rejoice well I don't feel like it he
[1:04:37] didn't say
[1:04:38] that always Rejoice Rejoice everm more
[1:04:42] verse 17 pray without ceasing
[1:04:47] yes the prophet said prayer is the
[1:04:49] greatest weapon ever placed in the hand
[1:04:52] of a human being more powerful than an
[1:04:55] atomic bomb oh yeah
[1:04:57] amen and when you're in a belly of a
[1:05:00] fish and everything is against you you
[1:05:03] can take this weapon of prayer and cry
[1:05:06] out to a God who hears your words
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:12] hallelujah and sometimes when you don't
[1:05:15] even know what to pray you don't even
[1:05:17] know what to say but the prophet said
[1:05:19] sometimes he doesn't even see your words
[1:05:22] he just sees your
[1:05:24] heart and I am so glad Brother David
[1:05:27] because there has been times I have gone
[1:05:29] out into the woods and I've knelt B
[1:05:31] before a tree and I couldn't even pray I
[1:05:32] didn't even know what to pray and I
[1:05:34] would just say the ABCs because I knew
[1:05:37] God was able to take the letters of the
[1:05:39] alphabet and say what my heart was
[1:05:41] trying to
[1:05:44] say
[1:05:47] Amen Rejoice ever more at all times pray
[1:05:52] without ceasing and verse 18 says this
[1:05:55] in in everything give
[1:06:00] thanks for this is the will of God in
[1:06:03] Christ Jesus concerning you now the
[1:06:07] Amplified Bible says it this way in
[1:06:09] every
[1:06:10] situation no matter what the
[1:06:13] circumstances are be thankful and
[1:06:17] continually give thanks to God wonderful
[1:06:21] for it is the will of God for you in
[1:06:24] Christ Jesus
[1:06:26] you see he didn't say we wouldn't have
[1:06:27] trouble he didn't say we wouldn't go
[1:06:29] through hardship he didn't say that we
[1:06:31] would have sorrow in our lives but he
[1:06:33] did say when you have these times don't
[1:06:36] pout don't quit amen just start praising
[1:06:40] him
[1:06:42] yeah just start thanking him you say
[1:06:45] what good would that
[1:06:46] do I'm going to tell you in just a
[1:06:50] second Amen in those times in those
[1:06:53] times some of the hardest times of our
[1:06:55] life life when you just throw up your
[1:06:57] hands not to
[1:06:59] quit but to praise him and to thank him
[1:07:03] for his goodness and to thank him for
[1:07:05] his Mercy in every situation no matter
[1:07:08] what the circumstances be thankful and
[1:07:12] continually give thanks to God for this
[1:07:14] is the will of God for you in Christ
[1:07:16] Jesus circumstances you see
[1:07:18] circumstances and situations does not
[1:07:21] change who God
[1:07:23] is the biggest problem you've ever faced
[1:07:26] in your life did not change who God was
[1:07:29] that's right
[1:07:32] amen he was still a Healer he's still a
[1:07:39] deliverer but praise power praise is
[1:07:44] power yes it and when you praise him and
[1:07:46] you pray with a Thanksgiving heart what
[1:07:49] does it do it turns the
[1:07:51] focus from your
[1:07:54] problems to the
[1:07:56] God who can fix
[1:08:00] them see as I've said many times the
[1:08:03] devil wants you to see the clouds but
[1:08:05] not the sun he wants you to see the
[1:08:06] storm but not the
[1:08:12] Sun but if you can turn your thanks if
[1:08:15] you can turn in your darkest hour and
[1:08:18] just start praising God just start
[1:08:21] thanking the lord for his goodness what
[1:08:24] does it do it
[1:08:26] refocuses from your problem to the God
[1:08:29] who can fix the
[1:08:31] problem you see Thanksgiving giving
[1:08:34] thanks to God focuses our attention on
[1:08:36] God rather than our circumstances if we
[1:08:39] fix our eyes on the difficulty then the
[1:08:41] pain becomes
[1:08:43] unbearable peace eludes us and the
[1:08:47] situation seems hopeless because all
[1:08:50] you're looking at is this report that
[1:08:53] says your daughter will never see again
[1:08:54] never walk again never talk again never
[1:08:57] feed herself again never go to school
[1:08:59] again that's what the MRI said that's
[1:09:02] what the CT scan said that's what the
[1:09:04] doctor said that's what your friends at
[1:09:05] work
[1:09:06] said and if that's all you ever focus on
[1:09:09] that's all you've ever got but in the
[1:09:11] midst of your greatest trial when you
[1:09:13] say God I'm going through a hard time
[1:09:15] God I really need you but I'm calling on
[1:09:17] you to do something big because I
[1:09:19] believe you're a big
[1:09:21] God I believe you can still open blinded
[1:09:23] eyes you can still make the lab walk you
[1:09:25] can still make cancers disappear you can
[1:09:28] still raise the
[1:09:31] dead no matter how great my problem is
[1:09:34] no matter how hard the sorrow is it is
[1:09:36] not greater than you so I will not focus
[1:09:38] on my problem I will not focus on my
[1:09:41] sickness I will not focus on the battle
[1:09:45] but I will focus on my general who's
[1:09:48] leading me in
[1:09:52] battle amen the situation seems hopeless
[1:09:56] but giving thanks shifts our Focus to
[1:09:59] the Lord and reminds
[1:10:02] us that we can know for
[1:10:06] certain that we're not
[1:10:10] alone but going through a hard time I
[1:10:13] know
[1:10:15] that but you're not
[1:10:19] alone we're not
[1:10:21] alone he said I'll never leave you nor
[1:10:23] forsake you he didn't just say now when
[1:10:26] you're on the mountain I'll be right
[1:10:27] there but when you're in oh no remember
[1:10:29] the the remember the
[1:10:31] story where the guy was looking back on
[1:10:33] the footprints on the sands of time in
[1:10:35] some of the most difficult times of his
[1:10:36] life in the great times of his life he
[1:10:39] noticed there was two set of footprints
[1:10:40] but in the deepest darkest times of his
[1:10:42] life he noticed there was only one set
[1:10:44] of footprints he said I don't understand
[1:10:47] he said why when I needed you the mo in
[1:10:49] the good times he was walking right
[1:10:50] beside me but in the bad times in the
[1:10:53] darkest times of my life there's only
[1:10:54] one a Footprints where were you when I
[1:10:57] needed
[1:10:58] you and he said Son you don't understand
[1:11:02] the good times of life I was walking
[1:11:04] with you but in the darkest times of
[1:11:05] your life that one set of footprints
[1:11:07] that you see they're not
[1:11:09] yours they're
[1:11:11] mine it was them times that I was
[1:11:14] carrying
[1:11:19] you we're not
[1:11:22] alone God is with us thank you Lord
[1:11:25] he loves
[1:11:26] us we're eternally secure we just saw
[1:11:30] that he wrote our name in his Lamb's
[1:11:33] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:11:35] the world and nothing can take that name
[1:11:37] off that
[1:11:40] book we're secure the Lord walks with us
[1:11:44] he will bring us
[1:11:46] through God will turn the experience
[1:11:48] into something profitable in our lives
[1:11:50] because you see we have this promise
[1:11:52] according to Romans 8:28
[1:11:55] what does it say we know that all things
[1:11:59] all things work together for good to
[1:12:01] them that love
[1:12:04] God Amen all things and sometimes we
[1:12:07] don't understand the moing and the
[1:12:12] training listen as a young preacher I
[1:12:15] used to preach God open blinded eyes and
[1:12:17] he made the lame walk I preached that I
[1:12:19] believe that but I never witnessed that
[1:12:22] I never seen that even though I believed
[1:12:25] that and I preached it yet I had never
[1:12:27] witnessed
[1:12:28] it
[1:12:30] until Jessica got
[1:12:33] hurt and then the God that I preached
[1:12:35] about that open blinded eyes I saw it I
[1:12:39] experienced it and now when I stand in a
[1:12:41] pull pit and I tell you God can open
[1:12:43] blinded eyes I don't tell you that
[1:12:45] because I've never experienced it I'm
[1:12:47] telling you that because I've
[1:12:48] experienced it I've seen it I know that
[1:12:50] he can do
[1:12:53] it and I would have never had that
[1:12:55] experience without going through that
[1:12:58] dark time so you see all things work to
[1:13:01] the good that God will mold you he'll
[1:13:03] bring things into your life that'll mold
[1:13:05] you and shape you in the way he wants to
[1:13:07] use
[1:13:08] you and as I told someone you know
[1:13:10] during the with taking the supplies over
[1:13:13] to North Carolina trying to help those
[1:13:14] poor people over there I told the people
[1:13:16] when we prayed you know I said God let
[1:13:18] us be your hands let us be your feet and
[1:13:20] I told him there's more ways for Show
[1:13:22] Jesus there's more ways to show Jesus
[1:13:25] than behind the pull
[1:13:27] pit true and God will mold us and shape
[1:13:31] us the way he wants to use us that he
[1:13:35] can show his light through us God will
[1:13:39] turn this experience into something
[1:13:41] profitable for our lives according to
[1:13:42] Romans 8:28 we know that all things work
[1:13:46] together for the good to them that love
[1:13:49] God to them who are the called according
[1:13:54] to his
[1:13:56] purpose his purpose you see Thanksgiving
[1:14:01] energizes us physically and
[1:14:05] emotionally and
[1:14:07] spiritually in in difficult
[1:14:11] times giving thanks to God in the most
[1:14:14] difficult times of our life it energizes
[1:14:17] us
[1:14:19] wow thank you Lord when you start
[1:14:22] praising God no matter how dark the
[1:14:25] trial is and you just start worshiping
[1:14:27] him and all of a sudden I've seen it
[1:14:28] many times in church I call it a
[1:14:30] piggyback blessing I've seen people I've
[1:14:32] sit back there on the seat and I've seen
[1:14:34] someone get a blessing I've seen the
[1:14:35] spirit of the Lord come up on them and
[1:14:37] they start rejoicing and you know what I
[1:14:38] do I say pour it on them Lord bless them
[1:14:41] real good set them on fire I just start
[1:14:43] thanking the lord for that blessing upon
[1:14:45] that person's life and you know what the
[1:14:46] next thing I know it's on
[1:14:53] me amen
[1:14:56] I call it a piggyback blessing because I
[1:14:57] don't know what else to call it but I
[1:14:59] know it works because there's something
[1:15:01] about it that in your darkest times when
[1:15:03] you begin to worship
[1:15:08] God there's a change takes place in our
[1:15:13] lives well what would be better well God
[1:15:15] can't help me I guess I'm too far gone
[1:15:17] there's no hope for me the doctor says
[1:15:19] it's the worst case he ever saw how's
[1:15:21] that going to help
[1:15:23] us how's it going to help us it'll never
[1:15:26] help us it'll just make us dig deeper
