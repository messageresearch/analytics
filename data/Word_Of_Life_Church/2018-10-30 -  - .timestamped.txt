[27:07] here tonight if God before us
[27:11] if God be for us verse 9 it says and it
[27:16] came to pass as Moses entered into the
[27:18] tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended
[27:21] and stood at the door of the tabernacle
[27:22] and the Lord talked with Moses and all
[27:26] the people saw the cloudy pillar staying
[27:28] at the tabernacle door and all the
[27:30] people rose up and worshiped every man
[27:32] in his tent door the Lord spoke unto
[27:35] Moses face to face as a man speaketh
[27:40] unto his friend and he turned again into
[27:43] the camp but his servant Joshua the son
[27:45] of nun a young man departed not out of
[27:48] the tabernacle and Moses said unto the
[27:51] Lord see thou sayeth unto me bring up
[27:55] this people and thou has not let and now
[27:59] has not let me know whom thou will sin
[28:01] with me yet thou has said I know thee by
[28:05] name and thou has also found grace in my
[28:09] sight now therefore I pray thee if it's
[28:13] a big word if I have found grace in thy
[28:17] sight show me now the
[28:19] way that I may know thee that I may find
[28:23] grace in thy sight and consider that
[28:26] this nation is thy people and he said my
[28:30] presence shall go with thee and I will
[28:33] give the rest and he said unto him if
[28:36] that presence go not with me carry us up
[28:40] not up hints for wherein shall it be
[28:43] known here that I on thy people have
[28:46] found grace in thy sight is it not in
[28:48] that thou goest with us so shall we be
[28:52] separated I and thy people from all the
[28:56] people that are upon the face of the
[28:57] earth and the Lord said unto Moses I
[29:00] will do this thing also that thou has
[29:03] spoken for thou has found grace in my
[29:09] sight and I know thee by name and he
[29:15] said I beseech thee show me thy glory
[29:18] amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[29:21] you Lord God for the reading of your
[29:23] word tonight for the assembling Lord of
[29:26] your people in this building Lord for
[29:28] every individual life that's here today
[29:31] Lord that would be touched by this
[29:33] sermon Lord we pray father you would
[29:35] remove any hindrances Lord whoever this

[30:03] way Lord may your word find its bedding
[30:05] ground tonight Lord may you be with us
[30:08] Lord in the service Lord and give us the
[30:10] unction of the Holy Spirit we pray
[30:12] father we pray you'd bless Lord brother
[30:15] Donny as he's away ministering Lord I
[30:18] pray for the meetings there all the
[30:20] people that are gathered Lord your bride
[30:22] worldwide may you receive the glory Lord
[30:25] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen
[30:28] you can be seated tonight
[30:34] this is a awesome Scripture as we know
[30:37] coming what led up to this point is
[30:40] Moses being anointed of God to lead
[30:43] God's family out of bondage and they
[30:47] come through all the red sea and we
[30:48] don't want to get into the story of that
[30:51] here tonight but we just have something
[30:52] amen the Lord placed upon our heart and
[30:55] we see that Moses comes to this place
[30:58] and he's gonna be anointed of God we
[31:01] find him
[31:02] anointed of God there on the mountain
[31:05] when he tells Moses take off your shoes
[31:07] for the ground wherewith you're standing
[31:10] is holy ground
[31:12] now this holy ground can place that God
[31:15] was referring to we know it wasn't a
[31:18] specific spot a four-by-four square of
[31:21] of earth or dirt that God said was holy
[31:24] but Moses God was speaking of a
[31:27] condition that Moses his life had came
[31:30] to that Moses had came to a spot of holy
[31:35] ground and now the Lord was going to
[31:37] Commission him to deliver God's people
[31:40] and and and Moses brings them all the
[31:42] way through the Red Sea and then God is
[31:44] going to have this conversation with
[31:46] Moses because he wants him to go forward
[31:49] we pick it up here and look in your
[31:51] Bible please if you have a Bible here
[31:53] tonight would you dust that thing off
[31:55] and use it here and not depend on
[31:57] technology but if they have it on the
[31:59] screen I want you to put it for those
[32:01] that didn't have it amen but we love our
[32:03] Bible amen think we should read it
[32:05] amen I think it should be something
[32:07] there's something about hearing the the
[32:09] turning of pages amen the rustling of
[32:12] the leaves for a preacher Amen so Exodus
[32:15] 33 just keep your Bible there turn in
[32:18] verse 9 and let's pick it up
[32:20] here where he comes and he's going to
[32:22] have this conversation in verse 12 and
[32:25] Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayeth
[32:28] unto me bring up this people and now has
[32:31] not let me know whom that will sin with
[32:34] me yet thou has said I know thee by name
[32:37] and thou has also found grace in my
[32:40] sight
[32:41] notice what Moses is go
[32:43] to say says now therefore I pray thee if
[32:47] I have found grace in thy sight show me
[32:52] now thy way that I may know thee that I
[32:56] may find grace in thy sight and consider
[33:00] that this nation is thy people Moses is
[33:04] saying to the Lord that what I believe
[33:06] what you've said about me you you've
[33:08] said that I found grace in your sight
[33:10] you've said that I that I'm on holy
[33:13] ground you you've said that you've
[33:15] ordained me and and commissioned me and
[33:18] and Lord I'm here to tell you today I
[33:20] believe your word I confess your word
[33:24] I believe what your word has said about
[33:26] me but God can you give me that
[33:29] revelation that you have about me you
[33:32] see it's one thing to confess what the
[33:35] Word of God says about you it's another
[33:38] thing to believe your confession are you
[33:43] here tonight friends it's one thing to
[33:46] say Lord I believe your word and what
[33:48] you've said and you said that I'll be an
[33:49] overcomer and God I can say amen to that
[33:52] I'll be an overcomer
[33:53] it's another thing for that revelation
[33:55] to drop in your heart to where you can
[33:57] say I am an overcomer
[34:00] I am what the word says about me I am
[34:03] going to be in his image not just
[34:05] because he said it but his word is real
[34:09] to me personally Moses was saying Lord
[34:13] if I found grace in your sight
[34:15] personally I let me know Lord that I
[34:18] have found grace in thy sight Lord what
[34:21] you're saying about me but reveal it to
[34:23] me God reveal it so that I notice how
[34:27] Moses said this so that I may find grace
[34:30] in your side Moses knew that finding
[34:36] grace and the sight of God was more than
[34:39] just hearing about the acts of God it
[34:42] was more than just hearing a sermon it
[34:44] was more than even seeing the acts of
[34:47] God but Moses said Lord I want to not
[34:50] just know your acts are here about your
[34:52] works I want to know your ways
[34:54] personally Lord and
[34:56] Bible says that to Israel that that God
[34:59] had shown his acts but to Moses he shows
[35:02] his ways he shows his glory and Moses
[35:05] knew that finding grace and the sight of
[35:07] God was a personal experience to the
[35:10] individual it wasn't just a confession
[35:13] that Moses could have he had to
[35:15] experience it personally
[35:17] Moses was saying Lord this is something
[35:20] that I've got to know not just what you
[35:23] know about me Lord you know many things
[35:26] about me you know me from the inside out
[35:27] but I want to know to have confidence to
[35:31] go forward
[35:32] another day another step I've got to
[35:35] know personally that I found grace in
[35:38] thy sight I want it to be a personal
[35:42] presence notice verse 4 and he said my
[35:46] presence shall go with thee and I will
[35:49] give you rest
[35:52] what an awesome thing to have the rest
[35:54] of God and only with the presence do you
[35:58] get the rest apart from his presence you
[36:05] don't get the rest you can have the
[36:07] books you can have the tapes you can
[36:09] play them from the morning until the
[36:11] evening and still lack the rest of God
[36:14] in your soul you can come to church come
[36:17] in here sermon after sermon and still
[36:19] lack the rest of God you can have this
[36:22] Bible you can have this church you can
[36:24] have good people you can have good music
[36:26] you could have good songs but only in
[36:30] his presence do you receive the rest of
[36:33] Almighty God and it's not an asura nor
[36:36] in a Bible but it's in the presence of
[36:39] Jesus Christ and I say tonight Lord I
[36:41] don't just want your word I don't just
[36:43] want a Bible I don't just want a sermon
[36:46] I don't just want to tape Lord I want
[36:48] your presence because in your presence
[36:50] Lord I can have rest for every day that
[36:53] I live I can have rest in the midst of
[36:55] trial I can have rest in the midst of
[36:58] the storm if I can find your presence I
[37:01] know everything's gonna be just alright
[37:04] oh I want to know that I found grace in
[37:09] your sight Moses was a man who was
[37:12] convinced that without the presence of
[37:15] the Living God in his life it was
[37:17] useless to attempt anything notice this
[37:23] he had the Word of God and what the word
[37:25] said about him I want you to make sure
[37:27] you catch this in the scripture Moses
[37:29] had the word you say well all you need
[37:31] is the word all you need is a promise
[37:33] from God not according to Moses Moses
[37:36] said I have your promise and I believe
[37:37] that promise but I want to let you know
[37:39] God I'm not going I'm not leaving I'm
[37:41] not going anywhere I'm not going unless
[37:46] I have not just your word but your
[37:48] presence which means your person which
[37:53] means you not just your gift but you you
[37:59] can have the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[38:00] not how you can have a gift from the
[38:02] Holy Ghost but not the Holy Ghost
[38:03] himself and Moses says I want
[38:06] I don't know swamp the gift I don't just
[38:08] want the promise Lord I want you notice
[38:13] what he says in verse 15 if thy presence
[38:16] go not with me carry us up not hence God
[38:23] says my presence will go with you Moses
[38:25] I'm Oh God God God says look Moses
[38:27] here's what here's what I'm gonna do I'm
[38:29] gonna send my presence with you Moses
[38:32] says that sounds good
[38:33] Oh God if that sounds good but here let
[38:35] me promise you something if you don't go
[38:38] I'm not going you notice what the
[38:43] determination of brother Moses Wisconsin
[38:45] I'm gonna go with you you found grace in
[38:47] my sight my presence will go before you
[38:49] and Moses said that's a good thing God
[38:51] because if it don't go I want you to
[38:53] know I'm not leaving
[38:55] I'm not going I've come to a place in my
[38:59] life that unless I know that I know that
[39:02] I know that you're with me I can't go
[39:05] another day I can't go forward I can't
[39:07] go and make any progress Lord I've got
[39:10] to
[39:10] oh you're there and you'll never leave
[39:12] me and you'll never forsake me and your
[39:15] abiding presence is with me before I go
[39:18] forward Lord because without your
[39:23] presence it is nothing more than a
[39:26] man-made attempt at serving God and I
[39:32] say to you today that unless your
[39:33] Christianity has the presence of Jesus
[39:36] Christ in it then your Christian life is
[39:38] nothing more than a man-made attempt at
[39:42] being good unless your life has the
[39:50] presence of God in it unless my life is
[39:53] backed up by a living God I have nothing
[39:56] more than a dress code a rule book of
[39:58] do's and don'ts and a lot of self-help
[40:01] book on how to be a better person
[40:03] how about how to how about how to
[40:04] influence people and how to how to live
[40:06] a good clean life oh but my brother I
[40:09] don't want that just here tonight I want
[40:11] my life not just to be a life of what I
[40:14] do and what I don't do I want it to be a
[40:16] breathing a God who breathes upon my
[40:19] life a literal reality that I hold
[40:21] within my soul if your presence isn't
[40:26] with me every day of my life then Lord
[40:30] it's not worth it it doesn't matter
[40:33] the ups or the downs it doesn't matter
[40:35] the highs are the lows let the presence
[40:38] of God abide with me always look at
[40:44] first verse 15 again and he said unto
[40:46] him with thy presence going out with me
[40:48] carry us up not hints he was saying Lord
[40:51] if your presence is not with me I'm not
[40:54] going anywhere
[40:55] I won't take another single step unless
[40:59] I have an assurance we need to get to
[41:03] that place with the Lord but I believe
[41:06] some of us need to get to that place
[41:07] with the Lord just say Lord you want me
[41:10] to go forward but I ain't going forward
[41:12] unless you're with me oh it was a
[41:15] desperation for Moses it was like Jacob
[41:18] who could say I'm not leaving until you
[41:21] bless me I'm
[41:22] no I'm different until I know I've been
[41:25] changed oh I can hear about it I can
[41:28] confess it I can read your word and what
[41:30] it says but Jacob said I've got to know
[41:32] I've been changed I'm different I'm not
[41:35] the person I used to be I'm not leaving
[41:38] until you bless me Lord always the song
[41:41] says I won't be denied I'm gonna get my
[41:44] blessing and if I have to stay here
[41:46] you'll find my bones at this altar but
[41:49] I'm gonna receive my blessing from the
[41:51] Lord because I can't live without him I
[41:54] can't serve or walk this Christian life
[41:56] without him I can't go forward unless
[42:01] you go with me Moses says don't even
[42:06] carry us up if your presence is not with
[42:12] me don't even send me for we're in
[42:17] notice verse 16 for wherein shall it be
[42:21] known here that I and thy people have
[42:24] fell notice what he's saying in this
[42:26] conversation for wearing or how shall it
[42:30] be known that that I and thy people have
[42:32] found grace in thy sight you say that we
[42:35] found grace Lord and you spoke to me
[42:38] face to face you've revealed that to me
[42:40] personally but how will anybody else
[42:41] know is it not or isn't this how they
[42:47] will know that you're gonna go with us
[42:51] so shall we be separated I am thy people
[42:55] from all the people that are upon the
[42:56] face of the earth notice what the notice
[42:58] what Moses is saying here in verse 16 he
[43:00] says a wherein shall it be known that I
[43:03] and that people have found grace is it
[43:04] not that thou goest with us so shall we
[43:07] be separated I and that people from all
[43:09] the people that are upon the face of the
[43:12] earth you know what Moses is doing
[43:14] Moses is literally quoting the word that
[43:17] God had said about him back to him did
[43:24] you catch that
[43:25] this isn't Moses his words Moses is it
[43:28] isn't bragging saying well I want to be
[43:30] separate I want to be different I want
[43:33] to be above all the other than
[43:34] nations of the earth I want to be
[43:36] peculiar Moses didn't say that Moses is
[43:40] literally quoting the word that God had
[43:43] spoken about him back to him and Moses
[43:49] is saying Lord this is what you said I'm
[43:52] only repeating what you've said it
[43:55] wasn't me
[43:56] ah you're the one who put who called me
[43:59] Lord it wasn't me who called me o my
[44:01] brother and my sister sometimes we need
[44:03] to quote the word back to God and say
[44:05] Lord it wasn't me
[44:07] who sought you you sold me it wasn't me
[44:10] who found you
[44:11] you found me Lord I didn't put this
[44:15] desire inside of my heart you put it
[44:17] there I didn't call me to this race you
[44:21] called me Oh hallelujah I didn't come to
[44:24] this church because I wanted to you
[44:26] called me here Lord and Moses is quoting
[44:30] what God said about him back to him to
[44:33] say Lord you're the one who said it not
[44:35] me you're the one who found me you're
[44:40] the one who changed me you're the one
[44:42] who saved me you're the one who filled
[44:43] me I didn't put a desire in my heart to
[44:46] serve you you put it there so Lord I'm
[44:49] saying here tonight come and finish what
[44:51] you started Lord come and finish the
[44:54] work that you started in my life I'm not
[44:57] here because I chose to be here you
[45:00] called me Oh God Oh does anybody feel
[45:06] that way from a burning desire down in
[45:09] the heart do you feel that way tonight
[45:11] just say Lord yearn that the Bible says
[45:13] you're not just the author you're also
[45:16] the finisher of my faith hallelujah the
[45:23] same one who who pulls they in a race do
[45:26] you realize that the Bible says that
[45:28] Jesus is not just the person who fires
[45:32] the trigger who pulls pulls the trigger
[45:34] and the gun to start the race he's also
[45:37] the one at the finish line waiting to
[45:39] receive you when you finish your race
[45:43] Oh hallelujah match my poll said lay
[45:46] aside every weight and every sin that
[45:48] does so easily beset you and run the
[45:51] race with patience oh you're the one who
[45:56] separated me you're the one who called
[46:00] me I'm not the one who put a desire in
[46:03] my heart to serve you you put it there
[46:06] Lord even beyond my explanation I should
[46:09] be a million other places than in church
[46:12] beyond my own explanation or beyond my
[46:14] own understanding Lord
[46:17] you called me now make me what you said
[46:22] I was going to be you know there's
[46:27] nothing wrong with saying that to the
[46:29] Lord God make me what you said I would
[46:34] be and the Lord said unto Moses verse 17
[46:40] I will do this thing also that thou has
[46:47] spoken for thou has found grace in my
[46:53] sight and I know thee by name
[47:01] the first time God said that wasn't good
[47:04] enough for Moses the second time notice
[47:08] the first time God says it Moses I'm
[47:10] calling you I want you to go and lead
[47:12] this people and I've called you I know
[47:15] thee by name you found grace in my sight
[47:17] but Moses wasn't convinced yet so he
[47:21] says that again were Lord I understand
[47:23] what you're saying but if I have found
[47:25] grace in your sight then show me your
[47:28] way O God God says okay Moses my
[47:30] presence will go with you O Lord I know
[47:32] your presence but Lord if it doesn't go
[47:34] then they don't even sin this Lord how
[47:36] will anyone know but Moses you found
[47:39] grace and my sight Moses my presence I
[47:42] know Lord you said that what was it
[47:44] it sounds like Moses isn't convinced of
[47:47] what the word says about him sounds a
[47:49] lot like me and it sounds a lot like you
[47:53] and he's questioning and questioning
[47:56] my lord I know you said this and God
[47:58] says Moses you found grace him I said
[48:01] but Lord how will anyone know if you
[48:04] don't go with us is it is it not that
[48:06] you go where with us what was that it
[48:08] was a picture of a man who was very
[48:11] aware of his own mistakes it was a man
[48:15] who was very aware of his own humanity
[48:18] and he knew there's nothing good within
[48:20] me I've looked and peered into the
[48:22] deepest part of my of my person and I'm
[48:25] there's nothing good lord I want you to
[48:28] understand are you sure you're gonna go
[48:33] because if it's up to me this is that
[48:36] this is going to be a disaster and you
[48:47] know what the Bible says God doesn't say
[48:49] God doesn't say Moses my goodness how
[48:53] many times do I have to tell you it
[48:57] could have been the first time God to
[48:59] say shoo go away Moses just get out of
[49:01] here you ain't gonna believe the word I
[49:03] already told you three times my oh you
[49:05] found grace in my son if you still can't
[49:07] believe by now I guess it's just
[49:08] hopeless for you no but the Bible says
[49:11] what this guy
[49:11] do he just keeps reiterating the word he
[49:15] just keeps telling him again and what
[49:17] does he do with you and me my brother
[49:19] and my sister he preaches another sermon
[49:22] and says I do love you and you say Lord
[49:24] but I don't know if you love me but I do
[49:26] love you Oh Lord I don't know if I'm
[49:27] gonna make it you're gonna make it and
[49:29] what does he do when you lose faith he
[49:31] tells you again and they told you again
[49:33] and it tells you again and sermon after
[49:36] sermon service after service God is it
[49:39] giving up what's he doing he's pouring
[49:41] his word into our heart to dispel all of
[49:45] our doubt and fears I'm so glad I'm so
[49:54] glad God doesn't kick Moses to the side
[49:57] and say well I guess it's just
[49:59] you ain't gonna ever believe our you
[50:01] know God keep saying it you have found
[50:04] grace in my sight and I do know thee by
[50:08] name and what do we do the very next
[50:09] week oh I just don't even know I don't
[50:12] even know look at me look at I'm such a
[50:14] mess and you come to church and a
[50:16] sermons preached and you have faith and
[50:18] you grab a hold and you believe the Word
[50:19] of God only to go out the next weekend
[50:21] and you're deaf down and back to scourge
[50:23] and back to Preston am I ever gonna make
[50:25] it what does God do he just comes the
[50:27] next Wednesday and tells you again and
[50:29] then you go out from that service and oh
[50:31] I don't know if God loves me I'm not
[50:33] sure if I'm even born again and what
[50:35] does God do does he kick you to the side
[50:37] and say just forget it you'll never make
[50:39] it no he comes the next Sunday and tells
[50:42] you you're an overcomer you're gonna
[50:44] make it you're gonna be in a rapture God
[50:46] does love you
[50:47] he keeps pouring into the heart of Moses
[50:50] to let him know this has nothing to do
[50:53] with you Moses this is the work of God
[50:57] oh we should give him praise and
[51:00] thanksgiving for that here tonight but
[51:04] you don't give up who me look you just
[51:07] keep pouring your word you have found
[51:11] grace I do know thee by name and if
[51:16] you're doubting what the Word of God
[51:17] says about you my brother and my sister
[51:19] that's okay God understands God is fully
[51:25] aware of what doubt and fear is God is
[51:31] fully sympathetic to the doubter you may
[51:33] be a doubter here tonight that doesn't
[51:35] mean that God doesn't love you what did
[51:38] what did he do after Thomas says the
[51:41] report comes back to Thomas and says
[51:43] Thomas you know there behold he's risen
[51:45] he oh yeah
[51:47] here he rose his body's not there and
[51:49] the Bible says Thomas after all of
[51:51] everybody else and the rest of the
[51:52] church to say praise God he's recent
[51:54] Thomas is standing over there there's
[51:56] arms curls going I don't know I just
[51:59] don't know I've got to have physical
[52:01] proof and he goes further and says
[52:05] unless I touch his hands I won't believe
[52:10] now does the Bible say God when jesus
[52:13] walks in that room he hugs Peter and he
[52:16] hugs he hugs all of his is his disciples
[52:19] and then he looks over at Thomas what
[52:21] are you doing here
[52:25] you doubter you unbeliever how dare you
[52:30] question how dare you have fears and
[52:35] doubts is that what God does to the
[52:38] doubter no he walks over to Thomas it's
[52:42] just Thomas here's my hands go ahead go
[52:50] ahead Thomas touch him
[52:52] Thomas touches his hands what's he doing
[52:55] what's he doing he's sympathetic to the
[52:58] man who doubts
[53:00] [Applause]
[53:02] what's God gonna do he's gonna reveal
[53:05] himself to you he says Moses I do love
[53:09] you I do know you by name I've called
[53:12] you
[53:12] I've ordained you I've anointed you and
[53:15] whether you feel called you are called
[53:18] and whether you feel ordained you are
[53:21] ordained whether you feel anointed or
[53:24] not does it have anything to do with the
[53:27] fact that you are anointed oh my brother
[53:30] and my sister
[53:31] let me read let me let me quote to you
[53:33] the words of your pastor heard him in
[53:35] Florence South Carolina preaching in a
[53:37] meeting he said when are we gonna
[53:38] realize that when you're called to be
[53:41] the bride of Jesus Christ you are
[53:43] anointed whether you feel anointed or
[53:46] not you are anointed to fight the devil
[53:50] you are anointed to overcome you are
[53:53] anointed to keep going you are anointed
[53:55] to get back up and it doesn't matter how
[53:58] you feel about it tonight
[54:00] it's what God's Word has said about you
[54:05] hallelujah I say it doesn't matter what
[54:08] I feel like it doesn't matter what I
[54:10] look like it doesn't matter what I think
[54:12] about myself when I look at myself all
[54:15] that matters is that he put a desire in
[54:18] my heart to serve Him that's why I'm
[54:20] here
[54:21] he put her desire in my heart to believe
[54:23] in a rapture that's why I believe in and
[54:27] it doesn't matter how I get from here to
[54:29] there he'll perform the word which he
[54:32] has spoken regardless of what I feel
[54:39] like verse 17 and the Lord said unto
[54:41] Moses notice in your Bible the Lord said
[54:44] unto Moses I will do this thing that
[54:47] thou has spoken for thou has found grace
[54:52] in my sight and I know thee by nay you
[55:02] say what in the world what was wrong
[55:06] with Moses my goodness man why do you
[55:09] have so much trouble you gotta ask and
[55:12] argue and I'm surprised God didn't just
[55:14] get irritated you and tell you to go
[55:16] away
[55:16] why why I don't understand what's wrong
[55:19] with Moses his face why couldn't with
[55:21] his faith why couldn't he just accept
[55:23] the Word of God why does he have to go
[55:25] around and around and around
[55:26] because Moses understood something that
[55:29] a lot of message believers need to
[55:30] understand he knew that the only thing
[55:35] that made him any different than any
[55:39] other person in the world it was not his
[55:44] stature it was not his intellect it
[55:47] wasn't his last name it wasn't the
[55:50] church he went to it wasn't his ability
[55:54] Moses knew that the only thing that made
[55:58] him different and the only thing that
[56:00] set him apart from any old person I
[56:04] don't care who it is any even any man
[56:08] from any other country any other nation
[56:10] any other tribe Moses was very honest in
[56:14] who he was
[56:16] in his natural state he was just a
[56:19] rotten failure like everybody else and
[56:27] the reason Moses contains and goes
[56:29] around and around and around and around
[56:34] is that the only reason that he was
[56:38] different than anybody is that God was
[56:42] for him that was it he knew that the
[56:50] only thing that separated him and made
[56:54] him any different than anybody else was
[56:56] the presence of God
[56:58] that was him that was the only
[57:02] difference and let me tell you something
[57:05] my brother and my sister there's not I
[57:07] don't care what you think about yourself
[57:09] and how high and lofty your opinion is
[57:11] of yourself and your church and what you
[57:14] believe there is not much that separates
[57:17] you from any body else and the rest of
[57:20] the world there's only one thing that
[57:23] makes us different than any other church
[57:25] and I promise you it's not our programs
[57:27] it's not our preachers it's not the
[57:30] ability or the charisma of our pastors
[57:33] or our preachers because there's much
[57:35] more charismatic much more gifted much
[57:38] more eloquent men who speak in churches
[57:41] then do our preachers in the message I'm
[57:45] sorry if that bust your bubble or
[57:48] offends you there's only one or two
[57:52] there's very little things that separate
[57:54] us from any other church or any other
[57:57] Christian in the world and it's not our
[58:00] music it's not our culture it's not our
[58:03] programs it's not our skits it's not
[58:06] anything it's strictly that the presence
[58:09] of Jesus Christ has smiled upon us and
[58:13] said I told you I chose you I selected
[58:17] you it wasn't because of anything
[58:19] good within yourself the only thing that
[58:27] separates our churches is the presence
[58:29] of God can move into our sanctuary and
[58:33] go from seat to seat the seat to seat to
[58:36] see the problem problem problem problem
[58:38] discerning discerning discerning
[58:40] discerning that means that if we lose
[58:44] the presence of God in our churches we
[58:47] are no different than anybody else
[58:55] the only thing Moses knew that makes me
[58:59] different is that the presence of God
[59:02] the shout of the king is in our camp
[59:09] brother Branham said it this way he said
[59:12] the presence the ever presence of the
[59:15] Living God is the lifeline of the church
[59:20] that means that if you lose the presence
[59:23] of God in your life or in your church or
[59:25] in your family you have lost everything
[59:29] you have lost everything what are you
[59:38] left with Moses knows if you slice it
[59:40] all down you dice it all down you cut it
[59:42] all down you remove all the facade what
[59:44] do I have I'm just a dirt diver who's
[59:48] running from Pharaoh I'm living out here
[59:51] in a tent I ain't got nothing nobody's
[59:53] got no money
[59:54] we ain't got good education we don't
[59:55] have good a good army we don't have any
[59:57] weapons we have Saul's and shovels and
[1:00:00] picks and axes were farmers so brother
[1:00:03] branham's said they were they were just
[1:00:04] dirt daubers we try to make ourselves
[1:00:08] special and intellectual and and I'm
[1:00:10] great and grant listens you me my
[1:00:12] brother my sister the elected of God is
[1:00:15] not some special people because of their
[1:00:17] human a life on earth or their career or
[1:00:20] their intellect or their ability or are
[1:00:22] their talent the only thing that makes
[1:00:25] them special is that God shines down
[1:00:28] upon them and his presence is Whitefield
[1:00:30] that's the only thing that makes them
[1:00:33] different so what am i doing today I am
[1:00:36] contending to say I refuse to trade the
[1:00:39] presence of God for any program or any
[1:00:42] beauty or any outward glory or any music
[1:00:46] or any great talent I refuse to trade
[1:00:48] the presence of God for anything I say
[1:01:03] God let your presence go with me every
[1:01:07] day of my life
[1:01:09] don't leave me Lord because when you
[1:01:14] tell when you tear it all down there's
[1:01:16] nothing different it's nothing different
[1:01:19] what do you have yeah a good dress code
[1:01:22] that's good good people
[1:01:24] interesting doctrines really interesting
[1:01:29] listen to me friend I'm sorry if that
[1:01:31] offends you here tonight what do you
[1:01:34] have if you take away the presence of
[1:01:36] God out of the message if you take away
[1:01:40] the living presence of Jesus Christ that
[1:01:43] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:44] forever what do you have you have good
[1:01:45] hunting stories have good people good
[1:01:50] friends good churches hey pretty good
[1:01:51] music man if I must say so myself but
[1:01:56] really what makes us any different than
[1:01:58] any body else Moses says there's only
[1:02:04] one thing the Lord are you sure you're
[1:02:07] going I'm going are you sure you're with
[1:02:10] me I'm with you are you sure you know me
[1:02:12] I know you by name are you sure we found
[1:02:14] grace in your sight at Moses you found
[1:02:17] grace what was it Moses same Lord
[1:02:19] because I'm nothing special I just want
[1:02:21] to warn you I'm nothing special unless
[1:02:24] you're going this is gonna be a disaster
[1:02:27] but Moses could say but if God is for us
[1:02:31] then who can be against us if God as far
[1:02:35] as nothing can stop us no weapon formed
[1:02:39] against you shall prosper if the
[1:02:41] presence of Jesus Christ
[1:02:43] is fair Oh give him a handclaps of
[1:02:48] praise hallelujah
[1:02:54] Moses could say I don't care how other
[1:02:57] nations are ran I don't care how other
[1:02:59] nations get their guidance I don't care
[1:03:01] how they form their strategies before
[1:03:04] they go into war I don't care how their
[1:03:06] governments are conducted or how their
[1:03:08] rulers conduct themselves or how they
[1:03:10] conduct their armies maybe that's good
[1:03:12] for them I don't care how you run your
[1:03:14] church there's only one principle that
[1:03:17] we abide by in this church and in this
[1:03:20] army and that's the presence of God
[1:03:22] living with us abiding with us I don't
[1:03:28] care how the rest of the world is Rand I
[1:03:30] don't care Moses could say I don't care
[1:03:33] how they bow they build their armies or
[1:03:35] their strategies we have one strategy in
[1:03:39] our army and it's not great generals
[1:03:41] with great war plans that desire to
[1:03:44] devise I promise you it's not a great
[1:03:46] chariot Simoes because you could say cuz
[1:03:48] we don't have any we don't have any
[1:03:50] Spears that we can count on we don't
[1:03:52] have any any chariots we can put
[1:03:54] confidence in when we go to war we don't
[1:03:57] have some great a million man army we're
[1:03:59] a small group of people with shovels and
[1:04:02] picks and axes we're not even trained
[1:04:05] fighters Moses could say but we do have
[1:04:10] a secret weapon
[1:04:12] [Applause]
[1:04:15] we do have a secret weapon we have a
[1:04:19] weapon of mass destruction
[1:04:21] and his name is Jehovah and as long as
[1:04:28] he's with us nothing will stand before
[1:04:30] us I said as long as he's with us we may
[1:04:34] not have armies we may may not have
[1:04:36] chariots we don't come and with armies
[1:04:39] and with soldiers and with spears and
[1:04:41] shields but David said I come to you in
[1:04:43] the name of the Lord for the name of the
[1:04:47] Lord is a high tower that a strong tower
[1:04:50] that the righteous can run into and be
[1:04:54] safe
[1:04:55] [Applause]
[1:05:00] Moses could say lordy
[1:05:03] if you don't go if your presence is not
[1:05:06] there look around what do we have we
[1:05:10] have no way to defend ourselves we have
[1:05:14] no army we could fall back on
[1:05:16] we have no intellect we can fall back on
[1:05:18] Lord if you're not there if your
[1:05:22] presence is not there then you can take
[1:05:25] that Tabernacle you could take all the
[1:05:27] curtains all the beads all the bells all
[1:05:29] the whistles all the furniture the
[1:05:30] candlesticks the showbread you could
[1:05:32] take all of it tear it all down because
[1:05:36] it means nothing unless the fire of God
[1:05:40] dwells
[1:05:42] and the presence of God is there Oh's
[1:05:50] that you say you could take all of it
[1:05:51] down you could take all of our doctrines
[1:05:53] all of our fancy cliches because without
[1:05:58] the presence of Jesus Christ without the
[1:06:02] presence of the Living God
[1:06:04] or helpless were reduced to nothing
[1:06:10] we're actually worse off than a
[1:06:14] denominational believer
[1:06:19] I'll just preach this from down here
[1:06:21] behind this pulpit that way if y'all
[1:06:23] decide to throw something at me
[1:06:27] you take the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:06:30] out of this message you're worse off
[1:06:32] than a denominational Christian who
[1:06:38] sometimes has better morals sometimes
[1:06:43] sometimes physically from the outside
[1:06:45] can do more service than you can live
[1:06:48] more of service has more of a servant's
[1:06:50] heart some of the greatest people are
[1:06:52] independent Baptists people with it with
[1:06:54] great servant's heart wanting to build
[1:06:56] orphanages and and wanting to build
[1:06:58] hospitals say oh that ain't what Jesus
[1:06:59] taught us to do but that's what Jesus
[1:07:01] called them to do yeah that's what he
[1:07:04] called them to do I said we would be
[1:07:08] worse off if you take away the presence
[1:07:11] of God the shout of the king the
[1:07:13] anointing of God you have nothing let me
[1:07:20] go a little further you're worse off
[1:07:23] than a sinner sitting on a barstool
[1:07:31] Luke chapter 15 turn there for get
[1:07:34] myself into trouble Luke chapter 15
[1:07:37] let's look at this here Luke 15 turn
[1:07:39] there in your Bible you love the Lord I
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:51] want you to look at this here in Luke 15
[1:07:55] verse 11 you got it's a min and he said
[1:08:00] a certain man had two sons and the
[1:08:04] younger of them said to his father
[1:08:06] father give me the portion of goods that
[1:08:08] falleth to me and he divided unto them
[1:08:10] was living and not many days after the
[1:08:13] younger son gathered all together and
[1:08:14] took his journey into a far country and
[1:08:16] there wasted his substance with riotous
[1:08:18] living and when he had spit all there
[1:08:21] arose a mighty famine in the land and he
[1:08:24] began to be in one and he went and
[1:08:26] joined himself to a citizen of that
[1:08:27] country and he sent him into his fields
[1:08:29] to feed swine and he would fain have
[1:08:32] filled his belly with the husks of the
[1:08:34] swine that the swine did he and no man
[1:08:37] gave unto him and when he came to
[1:08:39] himself he said how many hired servants
[1:08:41] of my father's have bread enough to
[1:08:43] spare and I perish with hunger I will
[1:08:46] arise and go to my father and will say
[1:08:49] unto him father I have sinned against
[1:08:52] heaven and before thee and AM no more
[1:08:54] worthy to be called thy son make me as
[1:08:57] one of thy servants good plan sounds
[1:09:00] real theological real principle you know
[1:09:03] I've messed up I took my father's
[1:09:05] inheritance I squandered it I know what
[1:09:07] I'm gonna do I'm just gonna go back I'm
[1:09:09] not gonna dare ask to be a son again I'm
[1:09:12] just gonna say I have it better off as a
[1:09:15] server in your house I have it better
[1:09:17] off than I do living with pigs and he
[1:09:20] would have and he says and he arose and
[1:09:22] came to his father but when he was yet a
[1:09:25] great way off his father saw him and had
[1:09:30] compassion and ran and fell on his neck
[1:09:33] and kissed him and the son said unto him
[1:09:35] hold on you don't know what you're doing
[1:09:37] now you gotta hold on just a minute now
[1:09:39] what he says he says father I've sinned
[1:09:42] against heaven and in thy sight and him
[1:09:45] no more worthy notices his father's
[1:09:49] trying to hug him and it breaks him he's
[1:09:51] saying I'm not even worthy to be called
[1:09:53] your son look at verse 22 I'm not even
[1:09:56] worthy to be coach ton but the father
[1:09:58] said to his servants notice he doesn't
[1:10:00] even respond to his son he doesn't try
[1:10:06] to convince him he doesn't preach to him
[1:10:08] he just says the Bible says but the
[1:10:10] father said to his servants bring forth
[1:10:13] the best robe and put it on him and put
[1:10:16] a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
[1:10:21] and bring hither the fatted calf and
[1:10:24] kill it and let us eat and be merry for
[1:10:27] this my son was dead and is alive again
[1:10:32] he was lost and is found
[1:10:38] and they began to be happy joyful
[1:10:47] shouting singing dancing praising
[1:10:52] jumping shouty they began to be merry
[1:10:57] what was it here this man had ruined his
[1:11:00] inheritance had when it lost everything
[1:11:02] that he had received as a little boy and
[1:11:05] he says I'm not even worthy to be called
[1:11:08] my mind my father's son
[1:11:10] I am gonna go back and I'm gonna I'm
[1:11:12] gonna just be his servant I'm just gonna
[1:11:14] I'm just gonna live
[1:11:15] I ain't escort's and I'm just gonna
[1:11:17] serve you know this is the mentality of
[1:11:19] so many Christians after we've messed up
[1:11:22] and ruin our chances and and we've made
[1:11:24] big mistakes and some of us have made
[1:11:27] some big mistakes in our life can we be
[1:11:32] honest here tonight some of us have made
[1:11:35] some huge mistakes and some really
[1:11:38] really bad choices some of us had almost
[1:11:44] went to the point of no return
[1:11:46] and some of us have almost lost
[1:11:48] everything
[1:11:51] but somehow grace somehow grace oh I'm
[1:11:59] so thankful today that I know grace
[1:12:03] I know Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
[1:12:07] some of us have so messed up and you
[1:12:09] could say oh I don't I can't even
[1:12:11] explain it you know how I explained it
[1:12:13] but god that's how I explained it but
[1:12:16] God I was messed up I ruined everything
[1:12:19] I was living in sin I had no chance but
[1:12:22] God who was rich in mercy
[1:12:26] I'm so glad he wasn't just rich in
[1:12:29] material things but he was rich in mercy
[1:12:32] and the Bible says the Sun starts coming
[1:12:37] home notice he's took his first steps I
[1:12:41] don't know what that first step may be
[1:12:42] for you here tonight when your heart
[1:12:44] starts to turn back to God you may be in
[1:12:47] a messed up condition lost everything
[1:12:49] think you're not worthy to even come to
[1:12:51] church let alone to be called a son of
[1:12:53] God I don't know what what you what your
[1:12:56] condition is here tonight
[1:12:58] but I know this boy who had squandered
[1:13:00] everything the Bible says as he started
[1:13:03] making his journey home no doubt all of
[1:13:05] these thoughts were going through his
[1:13:06] mind what am I gonna say what if he
[1:13:08] rejects me what if he would have well
[1:13:10] you know what if I'm not even allowed
[1:13:11] into his gates what if I'm not even
[1:13:12] allowed back a church what will
[1:13:14] everybody say what would everybody be
[1:13:15] thinking well well what were the people
[1:13:17] whisper about with a pastor even had me
[1:13:19] back well he allowed me even to come
[1:13:20] back to the church I know what I'll do
[1:13:22] I'll just how I'll be as I'll be a
[1:13:24] servant I can all sleep the I'll sweep
[1:13:26] I'll mow the grass and maybe I'll earn
[1:13:28] my way back into a seat in the church
[1:13:30] again you know what the Bible says the
[1:13:36] father did the Bible says the father
[1:13:39] brother Brennan says that father stood
[1:13:41] on the porch every day and look for that
[1:13:43] boy to come
[1:13:44] and the Bible says it this way it says
[1:13:47] when he seeing his son from afar notice
[1:13:55] he didn't wait for him to come up
[1:13:57] through the door all the way down
[1:13:58] through the altar get on his knees
[1:14:00] repent of his sins he didn't stand
[1:14:02] overtopping to him and listen and when
[1:14:04] he's repented of that and what he did
[1:14:05] wrong there when he now I'm gonna watch
[1:14:07] him when he goes and makes that ride and
[1:14:09] that right and that right and that right
[1:14:10] and that right I'm gonna sit here and
[1:14:12] wait and watch it when he's came to
[1:14:14] sanctification when he's really filled
[1:14:15] with the Holy Ghost maybe after two or
[1:14:17] three missionary trips after he puts
[1:14:19] this much in the offering then maybe
[1:14:20] I'll come in and I maybe I'll shake his
[1:14:22] hand and start off the relationship
[1:14:24] slowly though the Bible says that when
[1:14:29] the father seen him when he was still a
[1:14:31] long way from perfect when he was still
[1:14:34] a long way off when he was still messed
[1:14:37] up and with mistakes and full of
[1:14:39] failures that the Bible says the father
[1:14:41] started running to him and he made him
[1:14:44] in the middle hallelujah and God didn't
[1:14:47] wait for you to get perfect the Bible
[1:14:49] says his love was shown to us that while
[1:14:52] we were still sinners father runs to
[1:15:04] this boy Oh dad but you don't you don't
[1:15:07] understand it's okay it's okay my son
[1:15:11] who is dead
[1:15:18] he was lost and he's found the Bible
[1:15:21] says they begin to be merry
[1:15:23] what happened a party had started a
[1:15:27] feast a celebration kill the fatted calf
[1:15:32] oh and they begin to shout and they
[1:15:35] begin to dance however they do and they
[1:15:37] were they were rejoicing they were
[1:15:39] enjoying the joy of the Father
[1:15:46] they were basking in his presence they
[1:15:49] were they were feeling I think they they
[1:15:51] were they were enjoying the presence of
[1:15:53] the Father the Bible says they were
[1:15:56] making merry uh-oh
[1:16:01] verse 25 now his elder son was in the
[1:16:10] field and he hears the music what in the
[1:16:14] world I have never heard our church
[1:16:17] shout like that
[1:16:19] what in the world he hears it in the
[1:16:23] field he can hear the organ he could
[1:16:24] hear the piano hear the guitar hear the
[1:16:25] drums what's happening up there Bible
[1:16:29] says he's in the field I've never heard
[1:16:31] music like this and as he came and he
[1:16:35] drew nigh to the house as he got closer
[1:16:37] he heard music and someone say it and
[1:16:41] dancing he heard music and dancing verse
[1:16:49] 26 and he called one of the servants
[1:16:52] notice he asked one of the Deacons hey
[1:16:54] come outside here for a moment before I
[1:16:56] go in there let me just check things out
[1:16:59] here he call one of the service and
[1:17:00] asked what in the world is going on what
[1:17:05] what what do these things mean I don't
[1:17:07] even know what they mean I've never
[1:17:09] heard music like this I've never heard
[1:17:10] dancing in the dry never heard shout
[1:17:12] I've never heard plays I've never heard
[1:17:13] I've never been in this way I've never
[1:17:15] heard this or experienced this and he
[1:17:19] said unto Hume that brother verse 27
[1:17:21] that brother another one who was lost
[1:17:24] the one who was in the world the one who
[1:17:26] everyone had given up and written off
[1:17:30] he's come and thy father has killed the
[1:17:34] fatted calf because he has received him
[1:17:36] safe and sound and he was happy and he
[1:17:42] rejoiced and he said I'm gonna get in
[1:17:45] there shot with him no the Bible says he
[1:17:51] was angry
[1:17:52] now notice let's get to the cause of his
[1:17:54] anger and would not even go to church
[1:18:01] that's how upset he was I'm not even
[1:18:04] gonna go in there for came his father
[1:18:10] out well thank the Lord and entreated
[1:18:15] him verse 29 verse 29 and he answered
[1:18:20] and said to his father notice what is
[1:18:22] going to say to his father whoa
[1:18:25] ah these many years do I serve thee and
[1:18:29] he said Thor's father lo these many
[1:18:31] years do I serve thee neither transgress
[1:18:34] I at any time thy commandment and yet
[1:18:37] thou never gave us me a kid in other
[1:18:41] words you never you never slew a lamb
[1:18:42] for me thou never gave us me a kid that
[1:18:45] I might make merry with my friends
[1:18:50] jealousy
[1:18:52] but as soon as this sorry lowdown sinner
[1:18:58] brother of mine what's he doing
[1:19:02] notice remember what I said you're in a
[1:19:04] worse condition without the Holy Ghost
[1:19:05] you are in a worse condition sitting
[1:19:08] with religious do's and don'ts I don't
[1:19:10] do this and I don't do that and I don't
[1:19:12] do this you know what the Word of God
[1:19:14] does to a person it cleans them that's
[1:19:17] what baptism is supposed to do it's
[1:19:19] supposed to clean you justification it
[1:19:23] cleans you but let me tell you one of
[1:19:25] the most dangerous things for a person
[1:19:28] to be in it's cleaned but empty and this
[1:19:34] was a man who was clean of the world but
[1:19:36] empty of the presence of God
[1:19:41] he was cleaned but he was empty and
[1:19:43] Jesus said the Bible says that that man
[1:19:46] is in a horrible condition he'd been
[1:19:48] better off that he stayed dirty because
[1:19:55] what happens to the person who comes the
[1:19:57] sanctification and comes to all the
[1:19:59] rules and all the do's and all the
[1:20:00] don'ts that's what they become they
[1:20:02] become I do and I don't Christian I
[1:20:04] don't do this and I don't do this and I
[1:20:06] don't smoke and I don't drink and I
[1:20:07] don't Rico and I don't wear bats
[1:20:09] I don't wear shorts and I don't cut my
[1:20:10] hair and I don't I don't some cigarettes
[1:20:12] I listen to this I listen I listen to
[1:20:14] this you become I don't I don't I don't
[1:20:18] but what do you do I know what you don't
[1:20:24] do what do you do a person who Jesus
[1:20:29] said it this way says because what
[1:20:30] happens is when that house is cleaned
[1:20:32] and empty seven other spirits the Spirit
[1:20:37] comes back to the man finding it clean
[1:20:39] and sanctified and bring seven more
[1:20:42] spirits and the man's condition is worse
[1:20:46] than before he was clean you say why
[1:20:52] because oftentimes those seven other
[1:20:54] spirits that come back to make that man
[1:20:56] worse is not drugs and alcohol because
[1:20:59] they already came from that they got
[1:21:00] clean from that most of the time those
[1:21:02] other spirits is religious spirits
[1:21:06] and they become like this man I sat in
[1:21:11] church all these years I never broke the
[1:21:13] commandment I never turned from you I
[1:21:15] stayed at your side the entire time I
[1:21:17] was in church every Sunday every
[1:21:18] Wednesday 30 minutes early paid 10% and
[1:21:21] often paid 10% in ties I did everything
[1:21:23] you asked me to do I never smoked I
[1:21:26] never drank I never cussed on her and I
[1:21:27] never did this I never did this but
[1:21:31] there was no joy there was no love there
[1:21:35] was no happiness there was no pleasure
[1:21:38] in God and there was no pleasure in sin
[1:21:42] you see they live in the middle they're
[1:21:48] miserable man I don't know how I got on
[1:21:53] this here tonight I wasn't planning on
[1:21:55] it but as soon as this thy son was come
[1:22:03] with just devoured thy living with
[1:22:04] harlots and his killed
[1:22:05] you've killed for him the fatted calf I
[1:22:08] said all these years in church and I
[1:22:10] never transgressed I never did anything
[1:22:13] wrong yet you never turned up the music
[1:22:16] for me there was never no joy there was
[1:22:18] never no shouting like this there was
[1:22:20] never no party thrown for me
[1:22:22] notice what the father says to him in
[1:22:23] verse 31 and he said unto Him son thou
[1:22:28] art ever with me in other words you're
[1:22:31] at church every service you're always
[1:22:33] here and all that I have is that notice
[1:22:40] verse 32 it was meat that we should make
[1:22:44] merry and be glad for this thy brother
[1:22:45] was dead in his alive and was lost and
[1:22:46] found
[1:22:47] in other words your your your joy was
[1:22:50] always here but you never took advantage
[1:22:53] of it the Holy Ghost was not given to
[1:22:58] make you miserable
[1:22:59] it was given to make you happy it was
[1:23:02] given to give you the fullness of joy
[1:23:06] and some Christians are the most
[1:23:09] miserable people on the planet Earth
[1:23:12] because there's no joy in sin and
[1:23:14] there's no joy in the Lord I know that
[1:23:17] may choke you but the Bible says sin is
[1:23:19] pleasurable for a season so the younger
[1:23:24] brother and the who we went in didn't
[1:23:26] went to the world had pleasure in sin
[1:23:28] and now he's going to get pleasure in
[1:23:31] God and and he's going to rejoice and
[1:23:33] he's going to dance and this made that
[1:23:35] brother so upset and the father says it
[1:23:37] was available to you at all times
[1:23:40] you could have shouted at any time you
[1:23:42] could have asked for the Holy Ghost to
[1:23:44] feel you you could have asked for the
[1:23:47] Father to share his shed his love upon
[1:23:50] you it was there the whole time oh my
[1:23:56] brother my sister you don't have to beg
[1:23:58] a real believer to worship God you don't
[1:24:01] have to prod them and beg them
[1:24:03] raise your hands put your hands down
[1:24:05] sing to God I forgot a real believer
[1:24:07] brother Brigham senses its bubbling from
[1:24:10] the inside it's wanting to get out what
[1:24:17] are they doing they're enjoying their
[1:24:19] salvation they are taking joy in their
[1:24:23] salvation not misery Curtis said this
[1:24:30] way you don't have to beg an alcoholic
[1:24:31] to get drunk you don't you don't have to
[1:24:34] beg a druggie to take his drug it's what
[1:24:37] he wants to do because that's what gives
[1:24:38] him happy simulation and a high you
[1:24:42] don't have to beg him that alcoholic
[1:24:44] will let his marriage go he'll destroy
[1:24:46] let his job be destroyed his driving
[1:24:48] record he'll give everything to that
[1:24:51] alcohol just to get another drink he is
[1:24:57] sold out to his God he is sold out to
[1:25:01] his drug why that's all the happiness
[1:25:03] he's got that's what's been given to him
[1:25:06] in his life to make him happy so he
[1:25:09] takes advantage of it let me tell you
[1:25:11] something believers this is what God has
[1:25:13] given you
[1:25:14] are we sold out Christians are are we
[1:25:17] not you shouldn't have to be beg to
[1:25:19] praise God you should say I'm gonna take
[1:25:21] advantage of my salvation
[1:25:23] I'm gonna be happy in the Lord I'm gonna
[1:25:26] praise II with my voice and with my
[1:25:28] hands it's all I've got
[1:25:31] hallelujah that's what Moses was saying
[1:25:44] without that reality you have do's and
[1:25:48] dont's legalism if just do's and don'ts
[1:25:51] and do's and don'ts Moses says when you
[1:25:56] put it all together unless you go Lord
[1:25:59] all the other nations may trust in their
[1:26:01] armies but we don't have any weapons
[1:26:03] we have sticks we have farming tools we
[1:26:08] live in tents what was Moses saying Lord
[1:26:13] I'm nothing without you
[1:26:15] well can you say that here tonight
[1:26:19] said Lord when you slice it all down I'm
[1:26:22] just nothing without you you mean
[1:26:26] everything to me hard your presence with
[1:26:29] me in my home and in my family with my
[1:26:32] children when I'm at work when in my my
[1:26:34] car when I'm when I'm at church all I
[1:26:36] want to bring that presence with me how
[1:26:38] does the presence of God come into the
[1:26:40] church it's not by a song leader like
[1:26:42] brother Louie getting up here and
[1:26:43] singing it's not my piano player playing
[1:26:45] music that's not what brings it what
[1:26:48] brings it is use you bring the presence
[1:26:51] of God with you when you come to church
[1:26:53] and when that happens no one has to beg
[1:26:56] the preacher doesn't have to labor a
[1:26:58] song leader doesn't have to labor the
[1:27:00] musician stone we are caught up in a
[1:27:02] heavenly atmosphere hallelujah
[1:27:15] notice this in Abraham's life brother
[1:27:17] the power point if you go to that first
[1:27:18] slide God was so in the prayer in this
[1:27:21] man's life look at just some of these
[1:27:23] men and the Old Testament this is a man
[1:27:26] by the name of Abraham who you know very
[1:27:28] well notice what it says here and you
[1:27:30] could go to the next slide my brother it
[1:27:32] says then it came to pass notice this
[1:27:34] and it came to pass at that time that
[1:27:37] Abimelech and fie call the chief captain
[1:27:39] of the whole of his hosts spoke unto
[1:27:41] Abraham saying notice this is a heathen
[1:27:43] this is an unbeliever God is with you in
[1:27:48] all that thou doest this was not a
[1:27:52] believer this was not an Israelite this
[1:27:55] was a heathen man who didn't know God
[1:27:56] yet even the heathen had to testify
[1:27:59] there's something different about
[1:28:02] Abraham let me tell you something my
[1:28:05] brother when you go to work your
[1:28:07] associates you should not have to tell
[1:28:09] them that you're a Christian they should
[1:28:11] know it about if we are who we confess
[1:28:17] and say that we are it shouldn't have to
[1:28:19] be told to us teenagers your friends at
[1:28:21] school should not be shocked to learn
[1:28:23] that you're a Christian they should know
[1:28:26] by the evidence
[1:28:27] fruit that's in your life there's
[1:28:29] something different about that person
[1:28:33] there's something different about her
[1:28:36] there's something different about him
[1:28:39] everyone should be able to notice what
[1:28:43] does the Bible say in the book of Acts
[1:28:45] they were first called Christians at
[1:28:47] Antioch it doesn't say they first called
[1:28:50] themselves Christians at Antioch they
[1:28:53] were labeled Christians they didn't
[1:28:57] label themselves the rest of the world
[1:29:00] said you're Christians which means
[1:29:02] you're like Christ
[1:29:04] we shouldn't have to label ourselves
[1:29:07] Christians the rest of the world should
[1:29:09] label us and say that's a Christian next
[1:29:17] why brother noticed this man named
[1:29:18] Joshua God had promised to Joshua no
[1:29:21] enemy could stand against Joshua as long
[1:29:24] as the presence of God was with him
[1:29:26] notice there shall not any man be able
[1:29:29] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:29:32] life here's why why because you're so
[1:29:35] good-looking Joshua because you were so
[1:29:39] tall so strong man what you're my
[1:29:41] goodness you're just so intellectually
[1:29:42] so smart no because as I was with Moses
[1:29:49] so I will be with thee I will not fail
[1:29:56] thee nor forsake thee be strong and of
[1:30:02] good courage Joshua because when God's
[1:30:05] Spirit is present with you you can be
[1:30:08] strong you can be courageous because
[1:30:11] nothing shall stand before you all the
[1:30:15] days of your life
[1:30:16] why because of Joshua no because here
[1:30:20] was the secret as I was with Moses so
[1:30:26] shall I be with thee
[1:30:28] look at this man Gideon Lord told Gideon
[1:30:32] now mighty notice the mighty man of
[1:30:34] Valor
[1:30:34] now notice before this I had no record
[1:30:37] of Gideon fighting any battles winning
[1:30:40] any battles slaying any Philistine
[1:30:43] killing any kind of Goliath there's no
[1:30:45] record that Gideon had any victory in
[1:30:48] his life to label him or call him a
[1:30:51] mighty man a mighty man of Valor but
[1:30:55] notice what the word says it says and
[1:30:57] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[1:30:59] and said unto Him the Lord is with thee
[1:31:01] thou mighty man of Valor notice the
[1:31:04] order that he says this in he doesn't
[1:31:07] say thou mighty man of Valor the Lord is
[1:31:10] with thee
[1:31:10] but he says the Lord is with thee thou
[1:31:15] mighty man of Valor
[1:31:17] what made Gideon a mighty man of Valor
[1:31:19] brother Terry the Lord is with thee
[1:31:23] it wasn't anything Gideon did it was the
[1:31:26] fact that God was with him it's what
[1:31:29] made him who he was and go in this thy
[1:31:38] might do you know what is referring to
[1:31:41] in the next verse
[1:31:42] thy might is this verse what might am I
[1:31:48] gonna go what might are you gonna go
[1:31:49] with Gideon your intellect know your
[1:31:52] strength know your battle record no you
[1:31:54] ain't got one your weapon no don't have
[1:31:57] one just grinding you know we by the by
[1:32:00] that by that by the threshold notice
[1:32:02] what happens God says go in this time i
[1:32:05] Gideon could say what is my might
[1:32:11] go in that revelation don't go with any
[1:32:16] looking at yourself or what you can do
[1:32:18] or what you can do how many mistakes you
[1:32:20] make your records of wins and losses
[1:32:22] here's the strength I'm gonna give you
[1:32:25] to fight the enemy with I will fight
[1:32:27] your battles I will go before you I am
[1:32:31] with thee God tells Jeremiah that the
[1:32:37] whole nation on the next slide the whole
[1:32:39] nation would turn against you and reject
[1:32:42] your prophecies though you're on fire
[1:32:44] and you're in your bones is shut up the
[1:32:46] fire of God Jeremiah are going to be a
[1:32:48] mighty prophet of God but own nations
[1:32:51] are gonna hate you don't he even tells
[1:32:53] Jeremiah at one place don't even look at
[1:32:55] their faces when you preach because
[1:32:57] they're gonna be so angry and their face
[1:32:59] is gonna have such hatred for you God
[1:33:03] says Jeremiah the whole nation I will
[1:33:05] make unto thee this he says and I will
[1:33:08] make thee unto this people a fenced
[1:33:11] brazen wall and they shall fight against
[1:33:14] thee but they shall not prevail against
[1:33:17] thee here's why Jeremiah because you're
[1:33:20] smart you had a degree in theology
[1:33:22] because of your records of wins and
[1:33:24] losses because of how intellectual you
[1:33:25] are because of how much your obedience
[1:33:27] is Jeremiah you're so obedient man
[1:33:29] everyone else's obedience is here but
[1:33:31] your obedience is in the stratosphere
[1:33:33] Jeremiah you always listen you do
[1:33:35] everything I say no for I am with thee
[1:33:43] to save the end to deliver thee saith
[1:33:47] the Lord God says Jeremiah this entire
[1:33:50] nation can reject you when I was
[1:33:55] your family may turn against you your
[1:33:57] mama and your daddy may turn against you
[1:33:59] call you a cold call you a cult follower
[1:34:02] a brand might your entire family may
[1:34:04] hate you and despise you
[1:34:06] but don't fear I am with you all the
[1:34:11] days of your life to save you and
[1:34:13] deliver you saith the Lord God tells
[1:34:19] Isaiah of a special promise he makes of
[1:34:22] those who love him he says fear not
[1:34:24] notice what he says when thou passes
[1:34:26] through the waters I will be with thee
[1:34:29] and through the rivers they shall not
[1:34:31] overflow thee when thou walkest through
[1:34:33] the fire through the fire through the
[1:34:35] fire you mean I'm going to have to walk
[1:34:40] through the fire through the flood I'm
[1:34:42] gonna have to go through the flood jesus
[1:34:45] said in this world you will have
[1:34:46] tribulation you will have to go through
[1:34:49] the fire you will have to come through
[1:34:51] the flood but here's the promise I'm
[1:34:53] making you you'll go through every fire
[1:34:55] and I'll be with you you can go through
[1:34:58] the flood when the presence of God is
[1:35:00] with you it doesn't matter how hast the
[1:35:02] trial it doesn't matter how fierce the
[1:35:04] storm it doesn't matter how high the
[1:35:06] flood is you'll make it and you'll
[1:35:09] survive and overcome because I'm with
[1:35:12] you
[1:35:16] [Applause]
[1:35:21] all these men what separated them from
[1:35:24] every other man God is with you the only
[1:35:28] thing that separated the Ministry of
[1:35:29] William Branham a brother Branham was
[1:35:31] one thing he promised him the ever never
[1:35:36] felling presence of Jesus Christ will be
[1:35:41] with you and nothing will stand in your
[1:35:46] way
[1:35:46] because you're so intellectual you have
[1:35:49] such a great education you came from
[1:35:51] suffered prominent family you have such
[1:35:53] a good family and background and raising
[1:35:54] no he was the very opposite he was the
[1:35:58] very opposite no intellect no family no
[1:36:00] talent no ability to speak well I will
[1:36:03] it mean that he was gonna be the
[1:36:04] greatest preacher no but the never
[1:36:07] presence never fell in presence of Jesus
[1:36:09] Christ that was the only thing that
[1:36:11] separated him from other men who could
[1:36:14] speak better than him from Billy Graham
[1:36:16] and Oral Roberts who can have larger
[1:36:18] meetings and larger tension and have a
[1:36:20] larger entertainment and it could be
[1:36:22] more entertaining and speak better and
[1:36:24] speak more powerful the only difference
[1:36:27] that separated them from brother Branham
[1:36:29] was that when he spoke God backed up
[1:36:32] what he said the never felling presence
[1:36:37] of Jesus Christ will be with we're gonna
[1:36:44] close turn to second Chronicles gonna
[1:36:47] have 10 more minutes really is that okay
[1:36:51] just a few more minutes second
[1:36:53] chronicles chapter 14 I want to finish
[1:36:54] this
[1:36:55] amen second chronicles turn in your
[1:36:56] Bible
[1:37:03] you can you can kill that brother this
[1:37:07] is a man who we know you've heard about
[1:37:09] him I'm sure of ASA under the prophet
[1:37:12] Azariah says in 2nd chronicles chapter
[1:37:15] 14 it details this victory this great
[1:37:19] victory that ace is going to have over
[1:37:21] the Ethiopians ASA who has no army to
[1:37:24] speak of very few men untrained soldiers
[1:37:29] untrained warriors is going to go and
[1:37:31] have a great victory over a million
[1:37:35] Ethiopians a million of them and he's
[1:37:39] gonna have this grey mighty victory over
[1:37:43] this insurmountable army and what seemed
[1:37:45] unlikely and against all odds ASA comes
[1:37:49] out on the other side victorious we pick
[1:37:52] it up here in second chronicles 14 verse
[1:37:54] 11 and ASA cried unto the Lord is God
[1:37:56] and said Lord it is nothing with thee
[1:38:00] now this is before he fights the
[1:38:01] Ethiopians this is his prayer and ASA
[1:38:04] cried unto the Lord his God and said
[1:38:06] Lord it is nothing with me to help
[1:38:08] another words Lord and he it's nothing
[1:38:12] for you to help and we're in a bad
[1:38:14] situation here Lord all you've got to do
[1:38:16] is stretch forth your hand whether with
[1:38:19] many or with vim that half have no power
[1:38:23] he was speaking of himself
[1:38:25] help us O Lord our God you know when you
[1:38:29] say those words
[1:38:30] it moves God's heart help us help help
[1:38:37] that's a that's a powerful word you say
[1:38:40] that in public somewhere just the words
[1:38:42] help can silence and stop chaotic crowds
[1:38:45] and commotion you could be in the middle
[1:38:47] of an airport where people are going
[1:38:49] everywhere in every which way but let a
[1:38:51] person scream out for help one time and
[1:38:53] it paralyzes the atmosphere how much
[1:38:58] more does it paralyze heaven when a son
[1:39:00] or daughter of God cries and says help
[1:39:03] me
[1:39:05] Oh ASA said help me hard for we rest on
[1:39:12] thee and in thy name we go against this
[1:39:15] multitude O Lord thou art our God let no
[1:39:19] man prevail against the so the Lord
[1:39:21] smote the Ethiopians before ASA and
[1:39:25] before Judah and the Ethiopians fled
[1:39:28] what was it God in aces time of help
[1:39:32] moved and came on the scene now leading
[1:39:36] up to this historical victory was not a
[1:39:39] history of Israel that was very bright
[1:39:41] leading up to aces time as King was very
[1:39:44] dark was very bad horrible Kings Israel
[1:39:48] had sinned and had others worshiping
[1:39:51] other gods and other idols in their
[1:39:53] churches they were by no means a name
[1:39:56] that was worthy to be called children of
[1:39:58] God yet they still were even through
[1:40:01] their sin in their unbelief what did the
[1:40:04] Bible say God would rebuke them and
[1:40:06] chasten them his anger would be kindled
[1:40:08] against them but he never gave up on
[1:40:10] them he never turned his back on film he
[1:40:13] never forgot them you say why wouldn't
[1:40:15] he just forget them God gives us that
[1:40:17] answer can a mother forget her suckling
[1:40:20] baby how much more can I not forget you
[1:40:24] Israel though you've sinned though
[1:40:26] you've been in debauchery and in all
[1:40:28] kinds of evil I can't forget Israel
[1:40:31] she's inscribed on my heart forever an
[1:40:35] ace is going to come as a king they were
[1:40:38] not deserving of the help of the Lord
[1:40:41] that's why ASA prays the prayer that he
[1:40:44] prays yet they come with victory notice
[1:40:46] here of chapter chapter 15 the very next
[1:40:48] chapter of the first verse and the
[1:40:51] Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son
[1:40:54] of Oded and he went out to meet ASA and
[1:40:57] he said unto him hear ye me ASA now this
[1:41:02] is a prophet and he's not coming at the
[1:41:05] time to rebuke he's not coming at the
[1:41:07] time of defeat or depression this is a
[1:41:09] time of rejoicing in victory ASA has
[1:41:12] just conquered a million Ethiopians with
[1:41:16] a very small army ezreal shouting there
[1:41:19] and ASA says hear me as Rice's hear me
[1:41:23] ASA and all Judah and Benjamin the Lord
[1:41:27] is with thee and that's a powerful thing
[1:41:35] the Lord is with thee but read the very
[1:41:41] next part while you be with him he said
[1:41:50] for the night we have the presence of
[1:41:51] God hallelujah pretty Scott the presence
[1:41:53] of God is with us in our churches in our
[1:41:55] life in the message we have the presence
[1:41:56] of God as long as you're with ASA the
[1:42:05] Lord is with thee
[1:42:06] Joshua asked for the presence of the
[1:42:08] Lord and he got it
[1:42:09] Moses asked for the presence of the Lord
[1:42:10] and they got it Jeremiah asked Isaiah
[1:42:13] ass and they got it and you have asked
[1:42:16] for the presence of God and you've
[1:42:18] received it notice what he says the Lord
[1:42:20] is with thee while you be with him and
[1:42:23] if you seek him he will be found but if
[1:42:32] you forsake him he will forsake you
[1:42:39] now for a long season notice how the
[1:42:43] word is used for a long season Israel
[1:42:47] had been without the true God and
[1:42:49] without a teaching priest and without
[1:42:52] law but when they in their trouble this
[1:42:56] is still the words of Azariah the
[1:42:58] prophet trying to get a sand I
[1:43:00] understand ASA you were in need you were
[1:43:03] in trouble
[1:43:03] but but I want you to remember ASA it
[1:43:06] was just a one chapter before chapter 14
[1:43:10] and you were worshiping bail serving
[1:43:12] Ashraf you had gods you were wicked you
[1:43:15] were vile
[1:43:17] come on ASA be real here for just a
[1:43:19] moment
[1:43:20] everything looks rosy right now you're
[1:43:22] calling on me right now
[1:43:24] but don't forget ASA it was just last
[1:43:26] month you were in a bar sitting on a
[1:43:29] barstool just it wasn't too long ago
[1:43:35] where was your prayer life but you were
[1:43:38] still coming to church but you know good
[1:43:41] and well inside of your heart you were
[1:43:42] cold and more lost and far away from God
[1:43:45] than you've ever been you know that you
[1:43:48] were spiritually stagnant and still had
[1:43:51] no prayer life had no family altar devar
[1:43:55] or any kind of relationship with God and
[1:43:57] his church or around his people you were
[1:44:00] still there you still had the law you
[1:44:01] still had all the precepts all the all
[1:44:04] the articles you were still called the
[1:44:06] children of God but you know in your
[1:44:07] heart ASA for a long season of your life
[1:44:12] you were without God is that what it
[1:44:16] says verse 3 now for long season has
[1:44:19] ever been without the true God verse 4
[1:44:21] but when they in their trouble did turn
[1:44:26] to the Lord God of Israel and salt him
[1:44:30] he was you spent a long time sinning you
[1:44:37] spent a long time far away from God but
[1:44:41] when you turn to God God didn't stand
[1:44:44] there and say no huh sorry you were you
[1:44:47] were three years on the run I'm gonna
[1:44:49] take three years and make you grovel and
[1:44:51] hurt and complain
