[0:34] and I thought of that about sheep
[0:38] and I thought of that about sheep and
[0:42] Shepherd
[0:43] why did he choose David David is always
[0:46] talking about Still Waters and Green
[0:49] Pastures
[0:50] he was the psalmist that wrote songs and
[0:53] played on his heart
[0:55] to the glory of God and he must have
[0:57] been something about
[0:59] David pending sheep he must have been a
[1:02] real sheep herder did you notice one
[1:05] time there was a bear running and got
[1:06] one of his sheep and he killed that bear
[1:10] and a lion running he got one and he
[1:12] caught that beard Lying by the beard and
[1:14] took a knife and killed that lion
[1:17] see it was sacrificing for his sheep
[1:23] and if he was willing to lay down his
[1:25] life for the Sheep he was a type of the
[1:28] Good Shepherd
[1:30] there's something that God always liked
[1:32] the people under sheep did you ever
[1:34] notice you're the sheep of the pastors
[1:37] sheep of one whole other sheep have eyes
[1:39] and so forth likening people unto sheep
[1:43] you know why he likened us the Sheep did
[1:46] you ever did you ever fool a sheep any
[1:49] there are certainly educational and a
[1:52] Divine education to to learn of sheep
[1:55] I've raised them and shepherded them
[1:59] around and the little fellas but when a
[2:01] sheep is lost he's absolutely helpless
[2:06] I picked up cheating not standing maybe
[2:09] 300 yards from the Sheep full and where
[2:14] all the other sheep was and that sheep
[2:16] when he's lost he can't help himself he
[2:18] just stands our blades and blates until
[2:21] the wolf gets him or something takes
[2:22] place he he just can't find his way back
[2:25] he's totally helpless without a shepherd
[2:29] you know he said to Peter love me Peter
[2:32] more than these yeah feed my sheep I
[2:35] never said drive my sheep
[2:38] and Earth said kick my sheep he said
[2:41] feed my sheep that's what the Sheep
[2:43] needs is some sheep food don't you think
[2:45] so ain't all the best sheep food on the
[2:48] offer you sick sheep and all kinds of
[2:49] sheep here it is
[2:52] a great big bread basket of God Amen man
[2:55] shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:57] every word that proceedeth out of the
[3:00] mouth of God that's what the Holy Spirit
[3:02] lives on that's in you lives on the word
[3:06] of God
[3:10] that connection of Shepherd and sheep uh
[3:15] one time when I was over in the orients
[3:17] I learned a great lesson about uh seen
[3:20] in Saint John I believe the 10th chapter
[3:21] of words that I am the the gate to the
[3:25] sheepfull or the door to the sheepfall
[3:28] I often wonder how could he being a man
[3:31] be a door
[3:33] but then when I was over there I learned
[3:35] what it meant the Shepherds Drive their
[3:37] sheep into the Sheepfold and they got a
[3:40] arch that to go in at and when he drives
[3:43] them all in there then after they're all
[3:45] in and he counts them and every if he's
[3:47] one lacking you'll go out and get it he
[3:50] has to bring it in every sheep has to be
[3:53] accounted for every hour of the day
[3:58] how old a shepherd He is
[4:01] and that actually gets them all numbered
[4:04] and they're all vetted down the shepherd
[4:06] goes down by this hole where the Sheep
[4:09] coming at and lays himself down across
[4:12] the hole
[4:13] then no wolf can come in
[4:16] no feet can come in no harm can come in
[4:21] unless it comes over the shepherd first
[4:24] what a picture of Christ laying itself
[4:27] down far off that nothing can harm us
[4:32] unless it comes over him
[4:35] so if you're sick you say brother Graham
[4:37] sickness crossed over him but it was for
[4:39] the glory of God
[4:41] that's right
[4:43] he wants to maybe give you a testimony
[4:46] as the fellow said one time he seen a
[4:48] shepherd with its uh pack and a sheep
[4:51] and he said oh the head is a legal
[4:54] Advantage stuff he said well what did
[4:56] you uh what's the matter did it fall off
[4:58] a piston no I said I broke his leg boy
[5:01] said you must be a cruel Shepherd to
[5:03] break your own sheep's lakes and all the
[5:06] Sheep wouldn't mind me so I had to break
[5:09] her leg in order to hold her head her
[5:13] and love her and give her a little
[5:16] special food so that she would love me
[5:19] and follow me and so sometimes God has
[5:22] to do that to us
[5:24] let the doctor say oh come over nothing
[5:27] can be done and then God takes you up in
[5:30] his arms and patches a little bit
[5:33] don't you know I love you don't show I'm
[5:36] the Lord that he is
[5:38] but Lord I was taught that the days of
[5:41] me I know you were but I just had to let
[5:44] this happen so I could just show you a
[5:46] little special favor why don't you love
[5:48] me just a little more now I'm gonna let
[5:50] you get well did you ever had that just
[5:51] come to you I have many times
[5:54] that something happened just to check me
[5:57] down a little to let him Express his
[5:59] love
[6:01] now another thing you notice about sheep
[6:05] and the shepherd
[6:06] you know it's a disgrace for the
[6:10] shepherd to lose one sheep did you know
[6:13] that it's a reproach on the shepherd
[6:17] um
[6:21] [Music]
[6:24] yes sir if the shepherd loses one sheep
[6:29] it is a disgrace
[6:33] all the father has given
[6:36] will come and none's loss see him all
[6:39] that comes to me
[6:41] all right the shepherd can't afford to
[6:45] lose a sheep
[6:46] that's the reason you backslider tonight
[6:49] is hanging around your heart
[6:51] trying to draw you back to the full
[6:54] because he once kissed you and you
[6:57] kissed him and told him that you loved
[7:00] him and raise your hands and praise him
[7:02] and you backslid and went out there and
[7:05] got all butchered up and wounded up in
[7:07] your spirit but he still holds around
[7:09] you all the time come on back wandering
[7:11] sheep I just can't afford to let you be
[7:14] lost maybe the little sheep that he had
[7:16] to go way out on the mountain to find
[7:18] all through the place maybe you're that
[7:20] sheep tonight laying out there wounded
[7:22] somewhere but the shepherd can't afford
[7:24] to lose one sheep
[7:27] oh to follow the footsteps of the
[7:30] shepherd that's it
[7:33] don't be tempted toast about worried tap
[7:37] the urine down your today you got the
[7:40] victory tomorrow you're out of the
[7:41] victory Paulo the shepherd he's a lead
[7:45] so my sheep know my voice he said and
[7:48] the stranger said they get accustomed
[7:51] okay hearing I said well if another
[7:53] Shepherd would come in and give that
[7:55] little holy lady call that he gives
[7:57] there wood them sheep if they were out
[8:00] in the field cups at all no
[8:06] [Laughter]
[8:09] one more time
[8:10] [Music]

[8:21] every tone or that Shepherd's voice

[1:03:55] wonderful place a beautiful building and
[1:03:58] and we know this is the vision of your
[1:04:01] pastor brother Donnie our friend and and
[1:04:04] all of you
[1:04:05] and he showed us each piece that you
[1:04:08] would do and took us through the
[1:04:10] building
[1:04:11] and as I was walking through I thought
[1:04:12] you know God planned it this way
[1:04:16] he planted exactly like this and he was
[1:04:19] using your hands and your fingers and
[1:04:20] your minds to put it together
[1:04:23] but just wait till we get to our new
[1:04:24] home
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:38] you know you you worked on it and you
[1:04:40] watched the process of it it took the
[1:04:42] years that it took to build it now
[1:04:44] you're in it and
[1:04:45] and last night the preacher preached on
[1:04:48] the feeling of the presence of the Lord
[1:04:49] in this Temple and we felt him quite
[1:04:52] well
[1:04:53] and we just know incredible sermons have
[1:04:56] already begun to come forth from this
[1:04:58] this place and and new Souls will come
[1:05:01] and God's got great big plans here
[1:05:04] and then when we're done we'll leave it
[1:05:06] to the Beast and so
[1:05:08] but I thought as we walked through it
[1:05:10] every place seemed to almost be
[1:05:12] overwhelming for me because it was our
[1:05:14] first time viewing it
[1:05:16] and as I was walking through and I come
[1:05:19] to the Sunday school session back
[1:05:21] section back there and I thought how
[1:05:23] beautiful that was I thought one of
[1:05:25] these days we'll walk through heaven
[1:05:32] and every place that we see will be
[1:05:35] breathtaking and
[1:05:37] and just to see one another we'll be
[1:05:39] breathtaking and so
[1:05:42] amen God bless you we so love you with
[1:05:44] all of our hearts amen what a wonderful
[1:05:48] sermon last night
[1:05:50] I thought that was masterpiece
[1:06:01] you know he preached on the fire coming
[1:06:03] into this place in the presence of the
[1:06:05] Lord coming and and you know that was
[1:06:07] more real than what you realize because
[1:06:08] we went home we we went to the hotel we
[1:06:11] got in bed 1 30 this morning all the
[1:06:14] fire alarms went off
[1:06:17] we were standing outside together and I
[1:06:19] said well you preached it here we are
[1:06:24] God bless you brother Tim amen each and
[1:06:28] every one of you I'm looking forward to
[1:06:30] what God has in store tonight
[1:06:33] I'll speak to you for a little bit and
[1:06:35] then we'll we'll just step into another
[1:06:37] realm and just ask the Lord to do
[1:06:40] special things
[1:06:42] now what I want to ask you to do is I
[1:06:44] want you to invite him
[1:06:47] personally I want you to invite him to
[1:06:50] your place
[1:06:51] tonight I want to speak to you to you
[1:06:54] Monday night he dealt with me on this
[1:06:56] thought
[1:06:57] he has come to your house
[1:07:02] so if he would deal with me in that way
[1:07:05] he's here
[1:07:07] and he's always comes to do business
[1:07:11] and it's individual
[1:07:13] it's not my brother
[1:07:15] it's not my sister
[1:07:17] it's not other ones I have a need
[1:07:21] I personally believe that I can walk out
[1:07:23] of this building cancer free that's what
[1:07:26] I believe
[1:07:29] thank you
[1:07:33] I believe
[1:07:35] thank you
[1:07:39] so I would like to thank you all for
[1:07:41] showing up with my visit with the Lord
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:47] amen there's just no one that cares for
[1:07:51] you
[1:07:51] like Jesus
[1:07:55] no one
[1:07:57] and tonight as we ask him to come to our
[1:07:59] house
[1:08:01] he always comes where he's invited
[1:08:04] and he keeps all of his appointments if
[1:08:06] he said he would be here
[1:08:08] and it reminded us on Monday evening
[1:08:12] in a very special way
[1:08:14] he's come because of you
[1:08:17] and so we believe it with all of our
[1:08:20] hearts and we take him at his word
[1:08:24] I'm reminded that sometimes in our
[1:08:26] courage is our courage sometimes fail
[1:08:29] and our strength fails
[1:08:32] the night that the doctor called me I
[1:08:35] was in British Columbia speaking at your
[1:08:37] grandfather's Church
[1:08:40] brother West
[1:08:42] they called me five minutes before
[1:08:46] that I was to get in the car with
[1:08:48] brother Tom and told me that I had
[1:08:49] cancer
[1:08:51] and that night
[1:08:52] I would speak on Courage
[1:08:55] God just orchestrates everything doesn't
[1:08:57] he
[1:08:59] here's one of the opening statements
[1:09:01] courage is not having the strength to go
[1:09:04] on
[1:09:06] it is going on
[1:09:08] when you don't have strength
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:15] maybe you'd just like to say Lord come
[1:09:18] by my way
[1:09:20] come by my way
[1:09:23] Heavenly Father
[1:09:27] we have felt your awesome presence
[1:09:29] already in this building
[1:09:32] and we know that you're here
[1:09:35] as it was spoke last night the feeling
[1:09:37] of the Temple
[1:09:40] and how many buildings are built that
[1:09:42] never are filled with your presence
[1:09:45] how many people will sit in pews that
[1:09:47] will never get you
[1:09:49] but I'd like to say thank you
[1:09:53] thank you that you've come to our house
[1:09:56] I'd like to make you welcome
[1:09:59] now Lord Jesus you see our needs father
[1:10:02] there's so many needs that takes our
[1:10:04] breath
[1:10:05] but Lord there's not a one that you
[1:10:08] can't answer
[1:10:10] now Lord as we ask you father
[1:10:13] No Man Is A Healer we're only gifted to
[1:10:17] speak your word
[1:10:19] to lay hands on the sick that's what our
[1:10:21] commission is
[1:10:22] but Lord we know when you're here and
[1:10:24] your word is applied
[1:10:26] you'll do the work
[1:10:29] so father we thank you
[1:10:32] even like Jesus did before he prayed for
[1:10:34] Lazarus
[1:10:36] I thank you that you hear me
[1:10:39] Lord and so we thank you Father
[1:10:42] I ask you that you would anoint me as I
[1:10:44] would speak the word for a few moments
[1:10:46] Lord and I thank you Father that there's
[1:10:49] great men that are standing prepared
[1:10:51] that of a laid aside time to prepare to
[1:10:54] to to get ready for a prayer line
[1:10:57] but now Lord Jesus as we said in our
[1:11:00] pews
[1:11:00] we want to invite you to where we're at
[1:11:04] we want to invite you to our certain
[1:11:06] spot now
[1:11:08] Lord we just plead with you come come to
[1:11:12] my place
[1:11:13] Lord we call out your Your Name Lord
[1:11:18] come
[1:11:19] oh God help us today father in Jesus
[1:11:23] Christ's name we pray amen amen and a
[1:11:27] man
[1:11:28] if you will turn with me in your
[1:11:29] scriptures to Matthew chapter 6 and
[1:11:32] verse 9.
[1:11:35] I be I believe there's no greater prayer
[1:11:38] that can be prayed with Jesus prayed
[1:11:43] and after this manner therefore pray ye
[1:11:47] Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed
[1:11:51] be thy name
[1:11:53] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:11:56] earth as it is in heaven
[1:11:59] give us this day our daily bread
[1:12:01] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:12:04] our debtors and lead us not into
[1:12:07] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:12:10] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:12:13] the glory forever
[1:12:15] amen could you say Amen with me you may
[1:12:19] be seated
[1:12:25] he has come to our house
[1:12:29] brother Branham said prayer is the key
[1:12:33] that's the answer
[1:12:35] we live in a world that's looking for an
[1:12:38] answer we have it
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] Prayer Changes Things
[1:12:44] prayer is the most powerful weapon
[1:12:46] that's ever been put into control of
[1:12:48] human beings
[1:12:50] there's no atomic bomb
[1:12:53] no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[1:12:59] prayer will change the mind of God
[1:13:04] what an incredible statement a prophet
[1:13:06] would say to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:13:08] who has Authority with him
[1:13:11] the scripture says but he was wounded
[1:13:15] for our transgressions
[1:13:18] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:13:22] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:13:25] him and with his stripes
[1:13:30] we are healed
[1:13:34] how powerful and positive that that is
[1:13:38] [Applause]
[1:13:41] brother Brandon would say endorsed to a
[1:13:43] door he says if if we could have someone
[1:13:46] to come to with the door of our house
[1:13:48] we'd like to welcome them and welcome
[1:13:49] them in
[1:13:51] if it was the Queen of England and
[1:13:52] that's when she was alive
[1:13:54] if it was the Queen of England we would
[1:13:56] like to make her welcome
[1:13:58] we'd be all struck that she would come
[1:14:00] to our house
[1:14:02] to leave a castle like that and and to
[1:14:05] come and all the royalty and to come to
[1:14:07] our house
[1:14:09] he mentions the presidents and great
[1:14:11] generals if they would come to our place
[1:14:14] and if they would come we would
[1:14:15] definitely like to make them welcome and
[1:14:18] give them the best that we could
[1:14:19] possibly give
[1:14:22] but there's another one standing at our
[1:14:24] door
[1:14:28] and he's never had to be political
[1:14:32] he's never failed
[1:14:34] he has never been in crisis
[1:14:38] well as a matter of fact he's always
[1:14:39] known where you was
[1:14:41] before there was ever a sun or moon or
[1:14:44] star
[1:14:45] he knew the situation that you would be
[1:14:47] in tonight
[1:14:49] so he provided for you
[1:14:51] and knows where you're at
[1:14:54] so he knows the situation of your home
[1:14:57] he knows the situation of your marriage
[1:14:59] he knows the situation to what the
[1:15:01] doctors have been telling you all this
[1:15:03] time he's in control of it
[1:15:07] he has the answer he's not in the
[1:15:09] practicing of of medicine he is in the
[1:15:12] perfecting of it
[1:15:14] for he has provided a blood
[1:15:18] so we come under Great Expectations
[1:15:21] tonight because tonight could change our
[1:15:24] lives
[1:15:25] lives Generations can be changed
[1:15:30] now
[1:15:31] I'll just share this with you and
[1:15:34] every every man who's gifted as a
[1:15:36] minister gifted different
[1:15:38] one morning I Was preparing in my study
[1:15:41] at home
[1:15:42] and as I Was preparing
[1:15:45] the Lord showed me a vision
[1:15:48] it was a vision of a little boy in her
[1:15:50] church that had not been able to walk
[1:15:52] and it was way past the time for him to
[1:15:54] walk he was not even making an effort
[1:15:58] wasn't even crawling on the floor
[1:16:02] William and sister Gabrielle the other
[1:16:06] children would carry him from place to
[1:16:08] place
[1:16:09] Wes was a wonderful little child he
[1:16:14] would go to nobody else but his mom and
[1:16:16] his dad and his his siblings
[1:16:19] and division that morning that the Lord
[1:16:21] showed me that that I would step off of
[1:16:24] the pulpit and pick him up
[1:16:27] that would be a miracle
[1:16:29] and I would take him in my arms and I
[1:16:31] walk up the aisle with him and come back
[1:16:33] and then and then pray
[1:16:36] and he spoke to me
[1:16:38] I have come to their house
[1:16:43] when I walked into the office brother
[1:16:45] William is a minister there with us and
[1:16:47] he was standing there and
[1:16:50] and no way could he understand what was
[1:16:52] about to happen
[1:16:56] and I just looked at him and I said
[1:16:58] William
[1:17:00] I want to say this to you today
[1:17:03] Jesus is coming to your house
[1:17:07] as I as I preached and I felt the nudge
[1:17:11] I I just kind of carried for a moment I
[1:17:15] felt the nudge again it was on the third
[1:17:17] touch
[1:17:18] that I stepped off of the platform and I
[1:17:21] reached down and he reached up
[1:17:25] that was number one miracle
[1:17:27] and as I walked back I walked back
[1:17:30] through the through the aisle way and I
[1:17:33] walked back and I walked and I began to
[1:17:35] tell the congregation this was the
[1:17:37] visitation that I had this morning
[1:17:40] man can't orchestrate anything it is God
[1:17:44] that orchestrates it
[1:17:47] and as we had prayer and I handed him
[1:17:50] back into his daddy's arms he was
[1:17:52] standing there weeping and praising the
[1:17:54] Lord
[1:17:56] it wasn't immediately but they began to
[1:17:59] video that child over the coming weeks
[1:18:02] and over the coming months and now that
[1:18:04] guy runs all over the place
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:17] there was a visitation
[1:18:19] with sister Karen and a little fella
[1:18:22] named Drew
[1:18:23] a vision had been shown that he would
[1:18:25] walk
[1:18:26] months had passed and he would only
[1:18:28] stand near a couch
[1:18:30] sister Karen with brain bleeds and
[1:18:32] situations she's in a better house now
[1:18:37] and the Lord dropped in that room he
[1:18:40] made a visit
[1:18:42] and as God came and touched sister Karen
[1:18:45] that little boy immediately jumped and
[1:18:48] ran all over that house
[1:18:51] no man can do that
[1:18:54] no man can take the credit for that
[1:18:57] and you said well brother Ron that was
[1:18:59] you know that was you know that's just a
[1:19:02] story that you're telling can we believe
[1:19:03] it well let me tell you another there
[1:19:06] was a little girl
[1:19:07] that had nobody that would send out a
[1:19:10] message to call but she talked into a
[1:19:13] realm
[1:19:14] she was reading a book she had laid in
[1:19:16] the bed for nine years
[1:19:19] she needed Jesus to come to her house
[1:19:24] she needed him to come
[1:19:26] no matter the unbelief that was in her
[1:19:28] home or the unbelief that was in the
[1:19:30] community or even to feel sorry for her
[1:19:33] she needed more than sympathy
[1:19:36] she needed more than just people to take
[1:19:39] care of her she wanted to play the piano
[1:19:42] she wanted to be well she wanted to go
[1:19:45] to church she wanted to serve God
[1:19:49] and God sent his Prophet by her way
[1:19:56] you know the story
[1:19:58] how do you write poor as she could be
[1:20:01] today she owns more than houses
[1:20:06] because she said the right word at the
[1:20:08] right time
[1:20:12] how many homes was brother Branham in
[1:20:14] and and they entertained him but they
[1:20:16] didn't step into that momentum of that
[1:20:19] presence I would say this today when
[1:20:22] Jesus passes by I want to call out to
[1:20:24] him at the right moment at the right
[1:20:27] time I want to catch his attention
[1:20:29] [Applause]
[1:20:33] you say well brother Ron timing time and
[1:20:36] sometimes it seems like it's happened
[1:20:37] it's been so long
[1:20:40] well no doubt in the Scriptures it tells
[1:20:42] us that
[1:20:44] that there was a personal friend of
[1:20:46] Jesus
[1:20:47] come on down huh that he'd ate a lot of
[1:20:51] suppers with
[1:20:53] heard a lot of stories
[1:20:56] but now he's got sick
[1:20:59] and now his friends are telling him
[1:21:00] Jesus was such a friend but we bid him
[1:21:04] to come
[1:21:06] if he was such a great Pastor even if
[1:21:08] he's such a great Messiah he would come
[1:21:11] and heal you
[1:21:15] he breathed his last breaths
[1:21:19] his sisters put him away
[1:21:22] that rolled the stone
[1:21:24] no doubt they had a lot of emotional
[1:21:26] feelings
[1:21:28] you know sometimes we think it's just
[1:21:32] times just passed by and we must have
[1:21:34] missed it somewhere
[1:21:38] and Jesus began to make his way to their
[1:21:41] house
[1:21:43] today was going to be a different day he
[1:21:46] wasn't going to come and give a eulogy
[1:21:51] but he was going to remind them that I
[1:21:54] am the resurrection and I am the life
[1:22:03] and they begin to say that they believed
[1:22:06] that he would come in that Resurrection
[1:22:09] but they didn't realize today was that
[1:22:11] day
[1:22:13] this was their service
[1:22:16] this was their moment
[1:22:19] sometimes you can't realize it before it
[1:22:21] happens but after it happens
[1:22:27] and Jesus asked him a real serious
[1:22:29] question where have you laid him
[1:22:34] oh he he must go
[1:22:37] anoint the tumor he must going to go
[1:22:42] you know and
[1:22:44] maybe say some nice words he was
[1:22:48] that's exactly right that's exactly what
[1:22:50] he was going to do
[1:22:55] and he stepped up before
[1:22:58] the tomb knowing what was getting ready
[1:23:00] to happen
[1:23:02] because he knew a couple of days ago
[1:23:04] what was getting ready to happen
[1:23:06] but he had to wait till he went to sleep
[1:23:09] didn't die he went to sleep
[1:23:13] I didn't wait till he goes to sleep
[1:23:15] sometimes God's waiting on us
[1:23:19] and so he waits till he goes to sleep
[1:23:21] and now he comes because now it's time
[1:23:25] God's always on time
[1:23:27] so as he waits and
[1:23:30] and then he stands there and he winks
[1:23:33] he weeps because he's going to have to
[1:23:35] bring him back to this world
[1:23:38] where is that he's not worried about
[1:23:40] politics not worried about taxes who's
[1:23:43] the president not worried about the wars
[1:23:46] not worried about his hating neighbors
[1:23:47] he's not worried about any he's going to
[1:23:50] have to bring him from that realm
[1:23:51] fellowshipping with Abraham Isaac and
[1:23:53] Jacob tell him then the testimonies of
[1:23:56] he's been with Jesus
[1:23:58] and he's got to call him back for a
[1:24:00] little while
[1:24:02] so he begins to weep weep because of
[1:24:04] their unbelief weak because he's got to
[1:24:07] bring him from that Immortal Realm back
[1:24:09] to mortal
[1:24:10] only to have to go back there again
[1:24:15] and brother Branham you know I think
[1:24:17] it's so incredible that
[1:24:19] you know Jesus could have just
[1:24:22] and blew the stone away
[1:24:25] but he asked them
[1:24:29] isn't he masculine
[1:24:33] yet two women
[1:24:36] to roll a stone away
[1:24:39] and no doubt they begin to push and
[1:24:43] shove
[1:24:44] quite a heavy storm
[1:24:46] that no child could come and
[1:24:48] get inside of that
[1:24:51] heavy Stone that's been sealed
[1:24:54] and they begin to push
[1:24:57] it took an incredible amount of faith on
[1:24:59] their part
[1:25:02] it'll take an incredible amount of faith
[1:25:04] on your part
[1:25:06] to leave your seed and walk through a
[1:25:09] prayer line
[1:25:10] he could heal you there but it's a
[1:25:13] prayer line has been caught
[1:25:15] [Applause]
[1:25:17] it takes energies to move stones
[1:25:20] it takes Faith to move those stones
[1:25:26] because moving the stone says I believe
[1:25:31] whatever he says is going to come to
[1:25:34] pass
[1:25:35] this is way out of human control
[1:25:41] and he stood there and he said Lazarus
[1:25:44] we know the story brother Branham said
[1:25:46] had he not called him by name
[1:25:48] there would have become a general
[1:25:50] Resurrection because he was the voice of
[1:25:54] the Resurrection
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:26:03] God went to another house
[1:26:06] there's a man named job
[1:26:09] God had a conference with his enemy
[1:26:13] he made his enemy
[1:26:17] he created his enemy and being God he
[1:26:20] does good
[1:26:22] he does good at whatever he does and he
[1:26:24] created a powerful enemy
[1:26:27] the anti-type to himself
[1:26:30] one that would even sit at his right
[1:26:32] hand
[1:26:35] he created him so powerful that even his
[1:26:38] children would have to struggle against
[1:26:40] him
[1:26:44] he was having a conference with all the
[1:26:46] angels
[1:26:47] and the enemy came before him and
[1:26:51] he said where have you been oh I have
[1:26:54] I've been going all over Word of Life
[1:26:56] Church
[1:27:00] I've been going all over the message of
[1:27:02] the hour
[1:27:06] searching to and fro whom I might
[1:27:08] destroy
[1:27:11] who might might devour but you've got a
[1:27:14] hedge about those people
[1:27:18] and God began to testify there's nobody
[1:27:21] can testify like God does
[1:27:26] because he begins to testify that job
[1:27:28] was perfect
[1:27:30] it begins to testify none like him in
[1:27:34] the Earth
[1:27:36] and then he gives him permission
[1:27:39] to go and begin to try him
[1:27:43] and he puts it on parameters to where he
[1:27:46] can only go so far
[1:27:47] You Know The Enemy that you fight can
[1:27:49] only go so far
[1:27:53] he can only go so far
[1:27:56] you may think he's going to destroy you
[1:27:58] but he would have already did that if he
[1:28:00] could have
[1:28:02] Erica he would have already destroyed
[1:28:04] you if he could have
[1:28:07] he would have already took your life if
[1:28:09] he could have
[1:28:14] you know the story
[1:28:17] job loses everything
[1:28:20] his friends turn against him his wife
[1:28:22] turns against him
[1:28:27] it looks like that there's no way out
[1:28:30] he doesn't have a letter from God saying
[1:28:33] that uh
[1:28:34] I testified and you're going to be all
[1:28:37] right
[1:28:39] I I find it very interesting when God
[1:28:42] comes to job
[1:28:43] he never talks to him about his finances
[1:28:47] he never talks to him about his friends
[1:28:50] he never talks to him about the balls on
[1:28:53] his body
[1:28:55] he doesn't talk to him about his
[1:28:57] condition
[1:28:59] he talks to him about his future
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:04] he begins to talk about an eternal realm
[1:29:08] what job was in was a very temporary
[1:29:10] Realm
[1:29:12] and that's not really you know he's not
[1:29:15] really so interested in that temporary
[1:29:16] realm and so he says job where was you
[1:29:21] when I laid the foundations of the Earth
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:27] where was you at anyway
[1:29:30] Sun the moon the stars the Zodiac the
[1:29:33] first Bible
[1:29:34] I put you there Joe I thought of you
[1:29:37] there
[1:29:39] and then he takes him to the end
[1:29:42] when the sons
[1:29:44] of God Will shout
[1:29:47] he saw you there as well
[1:29:49] he reminded you job you're not going to
[1:29:51] be alone I've got a bride
[1:29:53] [Applause]
[1:29:56] they're going to go through a lot of
[1:29:57] things and and what's happened to you is
[1:29:59] going to be a testimony to them none of
[1:30:02] them is going to have a day like you if
[1:30:04] that was the way he could talk to him
[1:30:05] none of them are going to have a day
[1:30:07] like you
[1:30:08] but they're going to be there
[1:30:10] [Applause]
[1:30:15] would you like to him to come to your
[1:30:16] place and say no listen regardless of
[1:30:18] what you're going through I've got a
[1:30:20] seat for you at the merry supper of the
[1:30:22] Lamb
[1:30:25] and it's just a such a vision of who
[1:30:28] you'd be sitting beside of
[1:30:34] you know your your troubles would pass
[1:30:36] away for a few moments
[1:30:43] Jesus said
[1:30:46] in in Mark chapter 10 and verse 27.
[1:30:50] Jesus looking upon them said with men
[1:30:55] it is impossible
[1:30:57] it's quite a statement with men it is
[1:31:00] impossible that takes us all in
[1:31:02] but not with God
[1:31:04] for With God all things
[1:31:09] are possible
[1:31:13] Jesus said I am the resurrection and the
[1:31:16] life
[1:31:17] and he that believeth in me though he
[1:31:19] were dead
[1:31:21] yet shall he live again
[1:31:23] and whosoever liveth them believeth in
[1:31:26] me shall never die
[1:31:31] and he asks believe us thou this
[1:31:37] sister Linda Jimmy didn't die
[1:31:41] he's more alive there than he ever was
[1:31:44] here
[1:31:44] [Applause]
[1:31:55] sister Karen is not dead
[1:31:58] she's more alive there
[1:32:01] she's more beautiful there than she ever
[1:32:03] was here it's hard to believe
[1:32:06] but that's the way God prepares
[1:32:09] and he knows in just a few days we're
[1:32:11] going to be there with him and we'll
[1:32:13] forget all of this
[1:32:14] [Applause]
[1:32:16] David would say it like this the Lord is
[1:32:19] my shepherd and I shall not want.
[1:32:22] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[1:32:24] Pastures and he leadeth me beside of the
[1:32:26] Still Waters
[1:32:28] and it restoreth my soul and he leadeth
[1:32:30] me in the past of righteousness for his
[1:32:32] name's sake and yea though I walk
[1:32:34] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:32:36] death sister victory
[1:32:39] I will fear no evil
[1:32:42] for thou art with me
[1:32:45] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:32:48] thou prepares the table before me in the
[1:32:50] presence of my enemies and thou
[1:32:52] anointest my head with all in my cup
[1:32:54] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:32:57] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:33:01] and I will dwell in the house of the
[1:33:03] Lord forever
[1:33:05] you read that you read that since you
[1:33:08] was a child
[1:33:09] no doubt you you can say it by heart
[1:33:13] but David writes that right after he
[1:33:16] writes Psalms 22.
[1:33:19] where he says that I will not suffer my
[1:33:22] Holy One to see corruption
[1:33:25] I want to just share this with you just
[1:33:28] for a point
[1:33:29] that it might help you
[1:33:31] if he would not allow that Holy One to
[1:33:34] see corruption
[1:33:37] and Jesus was raised back to life before
[1:33:40] Satan could destroy his body
[1:33:45] and it would not see corruption
[1:33:48] you see you was in him
[1:33:53] and when Jesus stepped out of the Tomb
[1:33:59] Satan had bombarded him at every service
[1:34:03] he had called an illegitimate since he
[1:34:05] was a child
[1:34:07] he had made fun of him at 12 years old
[1:34:12] at every meeting even at the Mount of
[1:34:14] Temptation he was there to bombard him
[1:34:20] bombard him every service calling him a
[1:34:23] devil every service making fun of him
[1:34:25] every service questioned him but when
[1:34:28] Jesus walked out of that tomb
[1:34:32] Satan couldn't touch him no more
[1:34:43] now if he couldn't corrupt him then he
[1:34:45] can't corrupt him now
[1:34:47] and if you was in him he couldn't
[1:34:49] corrupt you then he can't corrupt you
[1:34:52] now
[1:35:00] sure your flesh stinks sure your spirit
[1:35:03] sometimes becomes contaminated but the
[1:35:06] seed that's on the inside of you that's
[1:35:08] Eternal that God thought of before the
[1:35:10] foundation of the world Satan can never
[1:35:13] corrupt that City
[1:35:25] he has parameters that he can fight
[1:35:28] he knows that there's only so much time
[1:35:31] to work so he bombards your mind he
[1:35:33] bombards your flesh he bombards your
[1:35:36] spirit
[1:35:37] but there's a realm he can't get to
[1:35:43] so you may be afflicted but you're not
[1:35:46] defeated
[1:35:50] you may have a lot of Affliction in your
[1:35:52] life but let me just say in none of that
[1:35:55] will we be defeated
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:36:01] I stand here tonight before you without
[1:36:04] a miracle I'm a dying man
[1:36:06] I'm not scared I'm not afraid I'm not
[1:36:09] giving up
[1:36:19] why should we quit why should we run why
[1:36:23] shouldn't we be afraid
[1:36:43] we are not victims
[1:36:47] sister Erica we're not victims
[1:36:50] we're Victorious
[1:36:53] we are not helpless but we're hopeful
[1:36:56] we're not defenseless but we're clothed
[1:36:58] in the armor of light
[1:37:01] we are not powerless but filled with the
[1:37:03] Holy Spirit we are not alone but are
[1:37:06] surrounded by a mighty host of angels
[1:37:11] we've been armed with brothers and
[1:37:13] sisters around us that are a team of
[1:37:15] body of believers we are an invincible
[1:37:18] Army we will never be defeated
[1:37:28] Hallelujah we'll never be defeated never
[1:37:32] never never never never be this city did
[1:37:35] you
[1:37:50] I like these words when I fall he lifts
[1:37:53] me up
[1:37:55] when I fail he forgives me
[1:37:58] when I'm weak he is strong
[1:38:01] when I am lost he is my way
[1:38:04] when I'm afraid is my courage
[1:38:06] when I stumbled he steadies me when I'm
[1:38:10] hurt he heals me when I am broken he
[1:38:13] mends me when I am blind he leads me
[1:38:16] when I am hungry he feeds me when I face
[1:38:19] trials he is with me
[1:38:22] when I face persecution he Shields me
[1:38:24] when I face problems he comforts me when
[1:38:27] I face loss he provided for me when I
[1:38:30] face death he carries me home he is my
[1:38:33] God
[1:38:36] he is my God
[1:38:43] he is faithful I am his and he is mine
[1:38:47] God is in control I am on his side and
[1:38:50] that means All Is Well with My Soul
[1:38:59] we have come to moments like this that
[1:39:01] we must make our stand
[1:39:04] we must take courage regardless of what
[1:39:07] your situations are
[1:39:09] you must press against the darkness
[1:39:13] maybe your bedroom has become a prison
[1:39:16] house
[1:39:16] a place to where only others come to
[1:39:19] tend to you God's with you
[1:39:23] you may have been already got too old to
[1:39:26] roll over in your bed and your your body
[1:39:29] is is weak God has not forgot you
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:33] he has not forsaken you he's still your
[1:39:37] doctor he's still your provider
[1:39:40] it is we that get disappointed in the
[1:39:43] temporary situations and sometimes begin
[1:39:45] to doubt but if we can only focus
[1:39:48] ourselves out Beyond
[1:39:50] [Applause]
[1:39:57] the scripture tells us to be strong and
[1:39:59] of good courage
[1:40:01] we must remind ourselves we're believers
[1:40:06] regardless of what you hear in your ears
[1:40:08] we're believers
[1:40:11] we're God's sons and daughters
[1:40:17] we didn't even choose to be that way
[1:40:19] we're God's sons and daughters
[1:40:21] [Applause]
[1:40:23] that means that we're the most powerful
[1:40:25] people on the Earth
[1:40:27] people in Washington think they're
[1:40:29] making decisions for us
[1:40:33] they only think that
[1:40:35] there's another realm that's making
[1:40:37] decisions for us
[1:40:45] and being Sons and Daughters of God
[1:40:47] we're challenged and commissioned to
[1:40:49] fight
[1:40:50] [Applause]
[1:40:52] brother Ron I don't have the strength if
[1:40:55] you can only move a finger move a finger
[1:40:58] if it can only say a word say a word
[1:41:02] we're not going to back up
[1:41:05] neither are we going to back down we
[1:41:07] shall fight
[1:41:08] [Applause]
[1:41:10] he shelters us under his wings
[1:41:13] he fights our battles he wins our Wars
[1:41:17] we cast out Satan with the Holy Ghost
[1:41:21] God is or has authorized us and
[1:41:25] empowered us
[1:41:26] to use the name of Jesus Christ
[1:41:30] for any need at any time under any
[1:41:33] condition
[1:41:36] now taking him at his word and by that
[1:41:39] Authority no matter how big that devil
[1:41:41] is
[1:41:46] he is defeated
[1:41:58] but being built the way he is you've got
[1:42:00] to remind him
[1:42:03] don't forget your job remind him of who
[1:42:08] you are and remind him of the he that's
[1:42:11] defeated he don't have the keys to his
[1:42:13] own house he is strict
[1:42:18] how humiliated that he must still when
[1:42:21] he hears a child of God
[1:42:24] you may not see the Angels around you
[1:42:27] you may not feel the holy presence of
[1:42:29] God around you but that devil can see it
[1:42:43] I'm reading you some things that has
[1:42:45] been really powerful things
[1:42:48] in my journey
[1:42:51] we shall fight on the beaches
[1:42:54] we shall fight on the landing grounds
[1:42:58] we shall fight in the fields

[1:43:09] for our families
[1:43:10] we will fight for our children
[1:43:13] we will fight for our healing we will
[1:43:16] fight for deliverance
[1:43:17] we will fight for joy we will fight for
[1:43:21] peace we will fight for the Holy Ghost
[1:43:24] we will fight until our bodies are
[1:43:27] changed and we're sitting at the
[1:43:28] marriage supper of the Lamb we will
[1:43:31] fight
[1:43:32] [Applause]
[1:43:48] Angelo Dundee was the trainer for
[1:43:50] Muhammad Ali
[1:43:52] who is still considered today to be one
[1:43:54] of the greatest Champions that ever
[1:43:56] lived
[1:43:58] I'm not here to debate that I'm just
[1:43:59] here to bring up a point
[1:44:04] he said when he would get Muhammad in
[1:44:06] the
[1:44:07] in the corner and he was getting beat up
[1:44:11] pretty bad looked like he was going to
[1:44:13] lose the fight
[1:44:16] he said it was not my job to teach him
[1:44:18] how to fight he knew how to fight
[1:44:22] he said it was my job as his trainer to
[1:44:25] remind him of who he was
[1:44:32] so that's what your pastor does that's
[1:44:34] what these men of God do
[1:44:37] you know how to fight you've got the
[1:44:40] best equipment that there is you are a
[1:44:43] champion of layout of sale we just got
[1:44:45] to remind you of who you are and where
[1:44:49] you came from and what's your mission on
[1:44:51] this Earth is to do fight you're an
[1:44:55] overcomer this is your hour
[1:45:09] when these worship Warriors come in
[1:45:12] and they begin to Lead You In Worship
[1:45:16] we know that we're not here to be
[1:45:18] entertained
[1:45:20] we got great talent we got great singers
[1:45:22] that's been exhibited tonight
[1:45:24] but all of that can happen and if we
[1:45:26] don't join into worship
[1:45:31] if we don't join into worship we miss
[1:45:33] the points
[1:45:35] so we begin to clap our hands we begin
[1:45:37] to Rejoice we begin to amen the word of
[1:45:40] God we begin to enter into that Realm
[1:45:43] Satan would like for us to be casual
[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:45:51] because he knows if you get reminded of
[1:45:54] who you are and you get inspired
[1:46:03] in your mind if you stay at work or you
[1:46:06] stay with your troubles at home or you
[1:46:07] stay with their situations or the
[1:46:10] sickness but if you could break through
[1:46:12] the barrier
[1:46:14] whether it's Wednesday night or Saturday
[1:46:16] night or Sunday morning whatever it is
[1:46:19] wherever you're setting
[1:46:23] Jesus has come to your house
[1:46:26] yeah
[1:46:29] brother on I can't sing doesn't matter
[1:46:33] God Made You
[1:46:35] he knowed how you'd sound
[1:46:40] he made you specifically the Way You Are
[1:46:44] brother Ron I can't carry a tune he
[1:46:46] knows
[1:46:49] but nobody can say it like you can say
[1:46:51] it
[1:46:52] nobody can take your place
[1:46:55] nobody can clap their hands like you
[1:46:57] clap your hands
[1:47:09] so let us rally to war
[1:47:12] let us stand shoulder this shoulder and
[1:47:14] worship God that's what this building
[1:47:17] was built for
[1:47:19] it is not an entertainment center
[1:47:22] you've got one of the greatest preachers
[1:47:24] that ever lived in the history of time
[1:47:26] standing here is your pastor but he's
[1:47:28] not here to entertain you
[1:47:33] he's here to create war against the
[1:47:35] devil
[1:47:37] he's ready to remind you that we will
[1:47:40] win
[1:47:56] Hallelujah
[1:47:58] we will win
[1:48:09] brother on but I'm afraid we'll become
[1:48:10] emotional die
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:13] how many quotes do we have to have that
[1:48:16] anything without emotion it's dead and
[1:48:19] it ought to be burned
[1:48:24] how many quotes do we need about
[1:48:25] stillborn children
[1:48:28] we're a lively Church
[1:48:36] can you imagine how much Havoc that it
[1:48:39] causes in a demonic Realm
[1:48:41] when Satan has bombarded you all week
[1:48:44] long
[1:48:46] and you still come to church
[1:48:48] foreign
[1:48:51] [Applause]
[1:48:53] you still worship God
[1:49:06] Hallelujah
[1:49:12] have humiliated that must be to the
[1:49:14] Demons of hell they they don't ever
[1:49:16] think that they can devote to destroy
[1:49:19] you
[1:49:21] and you're still expressing victory
[1:49:33] thank you
[1:49:37] I need a quote brother Ron you have got
[1:49:40] the right preacher
[1:49:41] [Applause]
[1:49:44] Psalms chapter 150 verse 1.

[1:49:52] place

[1:50:18] witnesses of it

[1:50:21] praise him for his mighty acts praise
[1:50:24] him for his excellent greatness praise
[1:50:26] him with the sound of a trumpet praise
[1:50:28] him with a sorcery and a heart brother
[1:50:30] Ron I don't like all that noise don't go
[1:50:33] to heaven
[1:50:41] as a matter of fact don't go to hell
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:48] everybody's naked there
[1:50:51] there's no friends there there's weeping
[1:50:54] and gnashing of teeth and screaming like
[1:50:56] there's never been screams on the earth
[1:50:58] so it's going to be a noisy place
[1:51:00] [Applause]
[1:51:03] we choose to go to a place where we're
[1:51:05] going to be shouting and dancing and
[1:51:07] praising God throughout the eternities
[1:51:11] worshiping the lamb who is worthy of all
[1:51:15] of our worship in all of us
[1:51:28] are you doing
[1:51:30] praise him with the Timberland dance

[1:51:51] they call it young people call it out
[1:51:57] let everything that hath breath
[1:52:00] [Applause]
[1:52:03] praise the Lord
[1:52:06] so if you're dead
[1:52:34] if you're mad you've got an excuse
[1:52:40] but we're in a church where there's a
[1:52:42] resurrection Act
[1:52:44] and you can't be Resurrected
[1:52:46] [Applause]
[1:52:52] now we're having a good time
[1:52:58] brother Branham says I
[1:53:01] I now challenge the devil to a debate
[1:53:05] Satan you are aware
[1:53:08] that you're whipped
[1:53:13] you have no legal rights
[1:53:16] Jesus Christ my Lord stripped you out of
[1:53:19] every Authority that you had
[1:53:21] when he died at Calvary to take away sin
[1:53:24] and sickness and you're nothing but a
[1:53:26] bluff
[1:53:29] and we're calling your bluff
[1:53:32] and you know that when our Lord came to
[1:53:34] the tree he cursed the tree and the next
[1:53:37] day it was withered and our lord said
[1:53:39] the disciples have faith in God for if
[1:53:42] ye shall say to the Mount and be moved
[1:53:44] and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:53:46] believe what you have said is coming to
[1:53:50] pass you can have what you said
[1:53:54] foreign
[1:53:57] you've heard that quote so many times
[1:53:59] you can quote it by heart
[1:54:00] but let's just think about it in reality
[1:54:04] Satan was standing there
[1:54:06] the prophet when he said it
[1:54:09] nowhere on the tape do you hear Satan
[1:54:11] say uh oh I got all of my power
[1:54:15] he couldn't argue with what the prophet
[1:54:17] said
[1:54:19] [Applause]
[1:54:20] I think it's nice when Satan has to amen
[1:54:23] the word
[1:54:24] [Applause]
[1:54:29] now I think about a night like tonight
[1:54:35] Satan knows that there's a prayer line
[1:54:37] getting ready to happen
[1:54:40] he's even sensible enough to know that
[1:54:42] he's going to get defeated tonight
[1:54:46] because it was paid for at Calvary
[1:54:54] you say brother Ron but I've had some
[1:54:55] really rough days I can tell you about
[1:54:57] rough days
[1:55:01] I want to share something with you it's
[1:55:02] been real blessed to my heart
[1:55:04] on the roughest of our days
[1:55:07] the lowest hours of our despair
[1:55:10] even in those times we're still chosen
[1:55:15] [Applause]
[1:55:17] we're blessed
[1:55:20] we're favored
[1:55:22] we're forgiven
[1:55:25] we're loved of God
[1:55:28] we're Victorious on our roughest days
[1:55:32] we are inheritors of all of Heaven's
[1:55:34] Glory
[1:55:36] we're privileged to walk with the King
[1:55:38] of Kings
[1:55:39] we're married to him
[1:55:45] and he calls us his beloved
[1:55:52] we're strong in faith
[1:55:54] we're armed to fight devils
[1:55:56] we're entrusted with God's word
[1:55:59] we have the most powerful weapon at our
[1:56:01] disposal
[1:56:03] and we are protected
[1:56:05] by our almighty God
[1:56:09] I want to remind you when he placed the
[1:56:11] Hedge about you
[1:56:13] you're more protected than Biden and you
[1:56:16] should be
[1:56:19] you're more protected than Donald Trump
[1:56:24] and you should be
[1:56:26] you're more protected than any dictator
[1:56:29] that there is in the world
[1:56:31] Hollywood celebrity
[1:56:34] brother on I don't sin I don't see it
[1:56:37] Psalms 91 said you're encamped about
[1:56:42] with the angels of God to protect you
[1:56:47] brother on I've been through some tough
[1:56:48] things just imagine what you would have
[1:56:50] went through without them
[1:56:52] [Applause]
[1:57:01] brother Brandon was asked why does God
[1:57:04] let troubles come
[1:57:07] brother random explains God harnesses
[1:57:10] troubles
[1:57:12] and put bits in its mouth and makes it
[1:57:16] obey him
[1:57:19] and those troubles bring us closer to
[1:57:23] God
[1:57:24] [Applause]
[1:57:28] three years ago I heard the voice of the
[1:57:31] Lord speak to me
[1:57:33] on that day sister Connie and I were
[1:57:36] preparing a meal for our entire family
[1:57:40] as they would come in
[1:57:42] we actually
[1:57:43] hugged and we kind of did a little dance
[1:57:45] in our what we called the ballroom
[1:57:50] and I said life just couldn't get better
[1:57:55] be careful what you say
[1:57:58] in two weeks
[1:58:02] you know
[1:58:04] things changed
[1:58:07] later that day
[1:58:09] the Lord spoke to me
[1:58:11] and it is speaking to me he said if
[1:58:14] you'll trust me
[1:58:16] I'll use you like never before
[1:58:22] me and his brothers back here have seen
[1:58:24] some of the most phenomenal Miracles
[1:58:25] that's known to man
[1:58:27] from the dead raised to people coming
[1:58:30] out of wheelchairs
[1:58:31] the death here I see
[1:58:36] cerebral hemog just literally dry up
[1:58:40] we we've seen incredible things take
[1:58:42] place
[1:58:43] cancers dry up and die
[1:58:47] so when I heard that I wrote it down
[1:58:48] real quickly put a date and a time stamp
[1:58:50] with it
[1:58:51] put it on my wall put it put it on my
[1:58:54] calendar placed it in my computer
[1:58:56] you know there's a lot of things I was
[1:58:58] thinking how is he going to use Me Maybe
[1:59:00] in a greater way maybe to see
[1:59:02] Visions more clearly maybe to understand
[1:59:04] the word greater
[1:59:06] in no way as a human being could I
[1:59:09] understand that the trouble was laying
[1:59:12] ahead of me
[1:59:15] of cancer
[1:59:17] brother Roy Shrewsbury would call me
[1:59:20] brother Tim was at our place
[1:59:23] brother Roy Shrewsbury would call me
[1:59:26] and he would say I was praying to God
[1:59:30] and he said I was I was praying to God
[1:59:31] he said God spoke to me about you
[1:59:34] brother Ron
[1:59:36] and he said tell brother Ron that he is
[1:59:39] like Daniel
[1:59:41] and he's preparing to go into a place to
[1:59:43] where no man has ever lived
[1:59:47] but he needs to tell the king O King
[1:59:50] I'll see you in the morning
[1:59:52] [Music]
[2:00:03] doctors say that I'm in the one percent
[2:00:06] category they call me a phenomenon
[2:00:09] they say everybody else we've got a lot
[2:00:11] of patients taking the same chemo that
[2:00:13] you're taking
[2:00:14] it's not the chemo
[2:00:19] I thank God for that and I take it
[2:00:21] brother bam says you go to a doctor take
[2:00:23] his medicine
[2:00:28] but I take that chemo it makes me sick
[2:00:30] it makes me go through a lot of
[2:00:32] different things it destroys organs in
[2:00:34] my body
[2:00:35] but it's the faith
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:40] [Applause]
[2:00:42] I wear a pen on my jacket
[2:00:47] because the doctors tell their other
[2:00:49] patients there's a preacher
[2:00:52] that's in the one percent category he's
[2:00:55] taken this same medicine but he's doing
[2:00:57] something that's worth it
[2:00:59] and you'll know him by the pen on his
[2:01:01] jacket
[2:01:16] let me just say this to you
[2:01:18] cancer is a vicious demon
[2:01:23] it is no puppy to play with
[2:01:26] it's not for sissies
[2:01:31] when I get shots in my back and they put
[2:01:33] needles in there about that long to try
[2:01:35] to help me
[2:01:36] I take I take chemo about 30 pills a day
[2:01:39] I take eight to ten shots of for for
[2:01:42] diabetics
[2:01:44] I I I do that every day I have to watch
[2:01:47] it I'll check it here in a few moments
[2:01:49] it'll be okay that's why I'm drinking
[2:01:50] Coke it's a real thing
[2:01:52] thank you
[2:01:57] but God's greater than cancer
[2:02:12] you see uh that was a conversation with
[2:02:14] a prophet
[2:02:16] and a mighty angel
[2:02:19] in a very special place called a cave
[2:02:22] and he was going to be sent around the
[2:02:24] world and he would give excuses of why
[2:02:26] he couldn't do it
[2:02:29] that all the diseases would not be able
[2:02:32] to stand before his prayers
[2:02:34] and he specifically called our disease
[2:02:37] cancer
[2:02:40] so you may be eating up with cancer like
[2:02:43] I am today but it does not have to
[2:02:45] control you
[2:02:48] it is not the winner
[2:02:52] brother Ron what should I do ignore it
[2:02:56] [Applause]
[2:02:58] move on
[2:03:00] prepare for the next sermon
[2:03:14] brother Branham tells us that Satan
[2:03:16] cannot take your life
[2:03:19] until God is finished with you
[2:03:21] [Applause]
[2:03:24] nothing happens to you unless God
[2:03:27] permits it
[2:03:28] [Music]
[2:03:29] brother Mike I've said it so many times
[2:03:31] and I said it at your place
[2:03:34] if you hear Ron Spencer die don't
[2:03:37] believe it for a second
[2:03:41] I will be more alive there than I am
[2:03:43] here
[2:03:51] now let me quickly preach to you
[2:03:58] remember our God is still the god of
[2:04:01] Elijah
[2:04:02] he is still the same God that ever was
[2:04:06] he's always been the same God
[2:04:09] he's never been defeated
[2:04:12] he's never once lost one ounce I owed a
[2:04:16] period or comma he's never lost none of
[2:04:18] his power
[2:04:20] he can heal the greatest disease in the
[2:04:23] world it doesn't diminish it
[2:04:26] he can say the worst Harlot prostitute
[2:04:30] worst drunk dope addict
[2:04:35] and it does not diminish his power none
[2:04:38] whatsoever
[2:04:40] on I'm too Farm God knows the darkness
[2:04:43] of hell he knows how to come and get you
[2:04:56] brother Brian was in prayer he said
[2:04:58] Satan you who bound these people you're
[2:05:00] exposed tonight your grips are lost you
[2:05:03] have no legal Authority at all
[2:05:05] Jesus Christ robbed you and stripped you
[2:05:07] at Calvary and we come as the Church of
[2:05:10] the Living God In The Name of Jesus
[2:05:11] Christ I adjure Thee to leave every
[2:05:14] person in the building come out of the
[2:05:17] people thou devil I jury thee by the
[2:05:19] Living God
[2:05:21] length
[2:05:22] [Applause]
[2:05:25] pretty powerful word live
[2:05:30] Brother Band that's no no you don't have
[2:05:33] to put it any more eloquent leave
[2:05:37] Satan's a squatter
[2:05:39] [Applause]
[2:05:41] leave
[2:05:43] you don't have the title deed to this
[2:05:45] property leave
[2:05:49] say it with me leave
[2:05:52] [Applause]
[2:05:59] but the RAM says have faith in God
[2:06:03] oh my how the devil
[2:06:06] has to recognize the supreme authority
[2:06:09] of Jesus Christ not me
[2:06:13] he hates me
[2:06:15] he don't have to mind me but he has to
[2:06:18] mind who I represent
[2:06:20] [Applause]
[2:06:22] he has to mind who sent me here
[2:06:27] [Applause]
[2:06:35] now
[2:06:36] the scripture says in first John chapter
[2:06:39] 3 and verse 2.
[2:06:40] beloved now are we the sons of God
[2:06:45] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[2:06:49] but we know that when he shall appear we
[2:06:52] shall be like him
[2:06:54] for we shall see him
[2:06:57] as he is
[2:07:00] the scripture says greater is he
[2:07:08] greater is he that is in you
[2:07:11] [Applause]
[2:07:12] then he that is in the world
[2:07:17] it is not you that stared it's him
[2:07:23] that is scared
[2:07:24] [Applause]
[2:07:27] I love these words
[2:07:29] I've been sick before
[2:07:31] but I made it
[2:07:34] I've been broke before but I made it
[2:07:38] I've been brokenhearted before
[2:07:41] but I made it I cried all night long but
[2:07:45] I made it
[2:07:47] I've been betrayed but I made it
[2:07:50] I've been lied on but I made it I've
[2:07:53] been left destitute but I made it
[2:07:56] I've been rejected but I made it I want
[2:07:59] to remind the devil I have made it
[2:08:14] for those that has known me for all
[2:08:15] these years you know this is my favorite
[2:08:17] scripture
[2:08:18] Isaiah chapter 54 and verse 17
[2:08:22] no weapon
[2:08:28] no weapon that is formed against thee
[2:08:30] shall prosper
[2:08:32] I'm not some young buck preacher that
[2:08:34] don't have blood I have been fighting a
[2:08:36] long time and I want to remind the devil
[2:08:39] no weapon
[2:08:52] no weapon that is formed against thee
[2:08:55] shall prosper
[2:08:57] every tongue that shall rise against
[2:08:59] thee in the Judgment Thou shalt cut them
[2:09:04] so every demon that has tormented you
[2:09:07] all this time write their names down
[2:09:10] make a list
[2:09:18] you're the ones
[2:09:21] that's gonna put him in hell
[2:09:26] I'm trying to behave
[2:09:29] [Music]
[2:09:33] [Applause]
[2:09:39] brother Branham talks about a woman that
[2:09:42] has came to a meeting
[2:09:49] she can't get in
[2:09:53] and brother Branham you know you know
[2:09:55] how everything's orchestrated by God
[2:09:57] [Music]
[2:09:59] brother random runs into her

[2:10:03] to make sure that you get it
[2:10:05] sir I'm looking for my papa
[2:10:13] we have came over from Memphis to see
[2:10:15] the Healer
[2:10:18] my papa was trying to find a way for me
[2:10:20] to get in but he told me to stand still
[2:10:23] but they they have pushed me out of
[2:10:25] place and I've lost where I was standing
[2:10:27] and I'm blind and I can't find my way
[2:10:29] back
[2:10:31] would you be so kind to help me to get
[2:10:33] to the bus where my papa can find me
[2:10:37] now this seemed like now this seemed
[2:10:40] like a hypocrite but I said
[2:10:42] what did you say that you come over here
[2:10:44] to see
[2:10:46] she said I come to see the Healer
[2:10:50] she said
[2:10:52] you sir I've been blind for years
[2:10:56] and she said I heard on the radio this
[2:10:58] morning of a man who got his sight
[2:11:01] and papa got the money ready and we
[2:11:04] chartered a bus and and I come over to
[2:11:07] see him
[2:11:09] now they say that you can't get near the
[2:11:12] building
[2:11:14] brother branham's response
[2:11:17] you don't believe in such stuff as that
[2:11:20] do you
[2:11:22] know in the days when we've got such
[2:11:24] fine doctors
[2:11:26] she said but you see sir
[2:11:30] they can't do me no good
[2:11:32] [Music]
[2:11:33] [Applause]
[2:11:36] so when they tell you four months to
[2:11:38] live and you're at the point of your
[2:11:40] death make ready
[2:11:43] there's another doctor
[2:11:59] can you imagine how bad that it Badgers
[2:12:01] Satan
[2:12:05] he's been getting so close
[2:12:08] but he can't take this preacher's life
[2:12:12] [Applause]
[2:12:13] and I'll walk right up In a Pulpit
[2:12:16] [Applause]
[2:12:17] [Music]
[2:12:19] I don't look like I got cancer I don't
[2:12:22] act like I don't cancer I don't just
[2:12:24] sound like I've got cancer
[2:12:26] had no proofs left after
[2:12:31] who wins
[2:12:49] but you see sir
[2:12:51] they can't do me no good
[2:12:54] I said do you mean to tell me that you
[2:12:56] believe that the prayer of a man
[2:12:59] would do something for me or for you
[2:13:03] and she said it like this I'll never
[2:13:05] forget it
[2:13:07] she said
[2:13:09] I'll tell you the what I'll do
[2:13:13] if you just help me to get in where the
[2:13:16] man is
[2:13:19] then I'll find my papa
[2:13:34] don't tell me about your circumstance
[2:13:35] tell me about your future
[2:13:37] [Applause]
[2:13:41] foreign
[2:13:43] I thought of blind Fanny Crosby she'd
[2:13:46] heard of this other man being healed and
[2:13:48] the other blind person and I thought a
[2:13:50] Fanny Crosby when she wrote past me not
[2:13:53] on Gentle Savior heal my humble cry
[2:13:56] while on others Thou Art calling do not
[2:13:59] pass me by thou stream of about thou the
[2:14:03] stream of all my comfort more than life
[2:14:05] to me
[2:14:06] whom have I on Earth beside thee or whom
[2:14:09] in heaven but the
[2:14:14] while God is healing in the Angeles
[2:14:16] Temple
[2:14:17] he can heal in this Upper Room
[2:14:20] he's The God Who healed that man in a
[2:14:22] wheelchair last night brought back the
[2:14:24] cancer off of the clock to rejoice and
[2:14:28] he couldn't even move he's the one who
[2:14:30] healed that little Ricky the one who
[2:14:32] sent the message all the way across the
[2:14:34] sea and spoke to the woman dying with
[2:14:36] diabetes and he'll sets his sister her
[2:14:39] sister here this morning called back
[2:14:41] he's that same God now
[2:14:45] I looked at her and said
[2:14:47] I I may be the one that you're supposed
[2:14:50] to see
[2:14:55] see how God locks
[2:14:58] things just exactly right
[2:15:01] why was I taken out back she grabbed me
[2:15:04] with the lapels of my coat like that she
[2:15:07] said are you the Healer
[2:15:09] and I said no sister I am not
[2:15:13] I'm just your brother
[2:15:15] I want to see the Healer
[2:15:18] I hope that you see them someday I
[2:15:20] believe that you will what is your name
[2:15:22] brother Branham you're the one that I
[2:15:25] want to see
[2:15:27] now no one knows me I pray for you
[2:15:30] but don't let it be known take my take
[2:15:33] your hand and I couldn't pull her hands
[2:15:35] off of my lapel
[2:15:37] she wasn't gonna miss it
[2:15:46] I haven't wasted my time rehearsing a
[2:15:49] story don't miss it
[2:16:05] she said that's all I'll ask you about
[2:16:07] we bowed our heads and while we were
[2:16:10] praying
[2:16:11] I heard a scream
[2:16:15] she ran out into the lot throwing people
[2:16:17] one way or the other
[2:16:18] she fell down on the gr on the ground
[2:16:21] screaming I once was blind
[2:16:26] I don't know what your testimony will be
[2:16:29] but she said I once was blind
[2:16:35] you once had a wayward son you thought
[2:16:37] he would never come back he once was
[2:16:40] Wayward but now he's so bad
[2:16:55] can I go to one more house before I come
[2:16:57] to yours
[2:17:00] it was a house of a man that was quite
[2:17:03] well known in the community
[2:17:05] especially in the religious world
[2:17:08] he had quite power and quite Authority
[2:17:11] when he walked down the street everybody
[2:17:13] was
[2:17:14] nodding to him
[2:17:16] he was well looked up to in the
[2:17:17] community
[2:17:20] but his daughter had become sick
[2:17:24] now he had heard echoes that there was a
[2:17:26] Healer in the land
[2:17:28] no doubt he had heard a lot of stories
[2:17:30] and they made sense and maybe in the
[2:17:33] heart of hearts this is what he had been
[2:17:35] looking for all along
[2:17:37] he saw the facade of a church
[2:17:42] he saw people that were full of dead
[2:17:44] men's bones
[2:17:46] he saw an empty religion that couldn't
[2:17:48] produce what he said it could produce
[2:17:51] and there was a hunger in his heart
[2:17:54] but now trouble had come to his house
[2:17:57] always makes a difference when it comes
[2:18:00] to your house
[2:18:02] as long as it's over Yonder over there
[2:18:05] or over there it doesn't matter quite as
[2:18:07] much but when it comes to your house
[2:18:10] oh it don't mean you don't pray with
[2:18:12] fervency but when it comes to your house
[2:18:15] it grips your heart it literally punches
[2:18:18] you in the gut it causes you to lay
[2:18:21] awake night after night after night
[2:18:28] he was smart enough to know
[2:18:33] I can't heal her
[2:18:36] and what I've got can heal her
[2:18:41] and if it costs me everything
[2:18:51] preaching me now
[2:18:53] if it cost me everything
[2:18:56] I've got to get to him
[2:18:58] [Music]
[2:19:08] he couldn't call out to a servant to go
[2:19:12] servant didn't have the burden
[2:19:15] he didn't call out to another affiliate
[2:19:17] to go they'd only shame
[2:19:22] he had to go
[2:19:24] to put you in a spot to where you've got
[2:19:27] to go
[2:19:31] he took off his religious hat
[2:19:33] because it didn't work
[2:19:37] he took off his religious cloak because
[2:19:39] it didn't work
[2:19:41] and today when he walked down the street
[2:19:43] he wasn't dressed like he was yesterday
[2:19:46] he's on a mission
[2:19:49] he's not headed to the local bread store
[2:19:53] he's not headed to the hardware store
[2:19:54] today
[2:19:56] he don't know where he'll find him
[2:20:00] but he's got to get to Jesus
[2:20:03] he knows those people that have called
[2:20:05] him Brethren looked up to him are going
[2:20:07] to disdain him and not like him anymore
[2:20:10] going to make fun of him
[2:20:13] but he's willing to forsake it all
[2:20:18] to get to Jesus
[2:20:25] then when you get there you got to get
[2:20:27] his attention
[2:20:31] but Jesus knew before you was coming
[2:20:37] isn't it incredible
[2:20:39] when Jesus says okay
[2:20:42] I'll go home with you
[2:20:46] I'll come to your house
[2:20:49] I'll come to your house
[2:20:51] Drew don't have to be crippled all of
[2:20:53] his life his children don't have to be
[2:20:55] crippled
[2:20:59] that cancer that you're fighting it you
[2:21:01] can break the cycle of that and your
[2:21:03] children doesn't have to break the cycle
[2:21:09] what about your sin cycle
[2:21:11] it's much worse than cancer
[2:21:18] wouldn't it be incredible to think about
[2:21:20] as Jarius
[2:21:23] now Jesus is coming to his house
[2:21:26] it's not just a wish it's not just an if
[2:21:29] but now he's making steps with him
[2:21:35] and he's telling him don't you fear
[2:21:38] you only believe
[2:21:42] I know something about fear
[2:21:45] the first two months of my diagnosis I
[2:21:49] woke up every morning weeping and crying
[2:21:51] tormented
[2:21:54] these two men sitting behind me made a
[2:21:57] surprise visit to my home
[2:22:00] you know there may be a lot of people
[2:22:02] make fun of these two men but I consider
[2:22:04] them the most powerful people on the
[2:22:06] Earth
[2:22:06] [Applause]
[2:22:20] when we surprisingly to me picked up
[2:22:23] brother Tim Pruitt
[2:22:26] at the airport
[2:22:31] I didn't know that brother Donnie Reagan
[2:22:32] and sister Carol was sitting in my
[2:22:34] living room
[2:22:39] brother on you're talking about Jesus
[2:22:41] coming to your house well he did
[2:22:46] I don't know what you're looking for but
[2:22:48] he did
[2:22:55] we've just been together just a few
[2:22:57] moments
[2:22:59] and I asked him not
[2:23:01] you know I asked them immediately
[2:23:03] I don't want to live with this thing no
[2:23:05] longer
[2:23:08] I don't want to live with this torment
[2:23:10] maybe you're sitting in your Pew and you
[2:23:12] can make the same statement I don't want
[2:23:15] to take this home
[2:23:17] [Applause]
[2:23:19] I'm tired of lying and cheating I'm
[2:23:21] tired of stealing I'm tired of lusting
[2:23:23] I'm tired of being in pornography I'm
[2:23:25] tired of this Tormentor in my life
[2:23:28] I don't want to leave this building
[2:23:30] without
[2:23:30] [Applause]
[2:23:37] let me just say this to you
[2:23:39] they begin to pray
[2:23:44] your pastor
[2:23:45] spoke in tongues for about 10 minutes
[2:23:50] brother Kim rebuke the spirit of fear
[2:23:52] and torment of cancer
[2:23:54] the spirit that comes with cancer
[2:23:57] I want to tell you
[2:23:59] the moment that they stopped praying
[2:24:01] that left
[2:24:03] it has never returned
[2:24:10] thank you so God be the glory
[2:24:23] once you come into contact with Jesus it
[2:24:26] doesn't make any difference what the
[2:24:27] critic says it doesn't make any
[2:24:30] difference or what everybody else says
[2:24:32] it don't make no difference when we are
[2:24:34] with you with Jesus everything is going
[2:24:37] to be all right
[2:24:39] thank you
[2:24:51] now everything is orchestrated of God
[2:24:56] maybe to even build his faith
[2:25:00] just a little bit more there was a woman
[2:25:02] that had suffered with a blood issue
[2:25:08] and she had been to the best doctors in
[2:25:10] the world
[2:25:13] and they couldn't help her
[2:25:14] they could only take her money
[2:25:16] but they couldn't help her
[2:25:20] but she decided
[2:25:22] if Jesus is not coming to me I'm going
[2:25:25] to him
[2:25:29] sometimes you got to make a journey
[2:25:32] it might be 17 hours but you got to make
[2:25:34] a journey
[2:25:37] she didn't need a private interview
[2:25:40] she didn't need him to tell her her
[2:25:42] story
[2:25:43] she didn't need nothing others were were
[2:25:46] trying to keep her back
[2:25:49] she was unclean
[2:25:51] up
[2:25:53] nobody else could help her they only was
[2:25:55] her critic
[2:25:56] but she had a revelation in her heart
[2:26:00] I don't need him to call my name I don't
[2:26:02] need him to lay his hands on me if I can
[2:26:04] only Touch the Hem of His garments
[2:26:08] [Music]
[2:26:19] you know the story who touched me
[2:26:26] she never lived with that ever again
[2:26:29] in her life
[2:26:31] it was over
[2:26:33] pretty incredible when it's over
[2:26:36] you've had cancer all this time and then
[2:26:38] it's over
[2:26:41] I'm going to live that
[2:26:44] I'm gonna come back here and preach to
[2:26:45] you I lived cancer
[2:26:50] maybe it was in a prayer line
[2:26:53] while I was praying for you and I felt
[2:26:55] something come on to the inside of me I
[2:26:58] felt something moved through my brain
[2:26:59] and something through my lungs and
[2:27:01] something through my lymph nodes
[2:27:04] I just felt him
[2:27:16] and he watched that take place
[2:27:19] then one of these preacher friends came
[2:27:23] trouble not the master
[2:27:25] your daughter's dead
[2:27:28] news doesn't trouble Jesus
[2:27:33] [Applause]
[2:27:35] don't worry bad news doesn't trouble
[2:27:37] Jesus it it only makes the story better
[2:27:42] stupid devil
[2:27:54] it may not be socially correct but I
[2:27:56] want you to say it with me stupid devil
[2:28:10] Jesus reminded him again
[2:28:12] I'm with you
[2:28:16] when I left where we was
[2:28:19] I'm going to complete my mission
[2:28:22] I'm on a mission to come to your house
[2:28:25] and she's not dead
[2:28:28] she's asleep
[2:28:31] no doubt as they got closer they heard
[2:28:33] the they heard the music playing and
[2:28:35] wailing and crying
[2:28:40] Jesus didn't applaud him
[2:28:43] what is this
[2:28:47] she died she's not dead
[2:28:50] she's asleep
[2:28:53] he didn't ask them to join in prayer
[2:28:56] he cast the unbelief out
[2:29:01] sometimes you've got to dismiss service
[2:29:03] of the unbelief belief
[2:29:05] [Applause]
[2:29:19] that was a girl I know I know it was a
[2:29:21] god
[2:29:22] we're from the southern part of Heaven
[2:29:24] you know we're Fighters
[2:29:28] [Applause]
[2:29:36] foreign
[2:29:40] trying to compose myself for a moment
[2:29:44] there wasn't a question in his mind of
[2:29:47] what was getting ready to take place
[2:29:52] I I want to I want to as we come to the
[2:29:55] end
[2:29:56] there's not a question in my mind
[2:29:58] of what's getting ready to take place
[2:30:00] tonight
[2:30:03] if brother Donnie felt led for us to
[2:30:05] come
[2:30:06] and God gave us these words to preach
[2:30:09] then God's on a mission
[2:30:11] when he told me Monday night exactly
[2:30:13] what to say and what to preach
[2:30:16] and he's going to do some work
[2:30:20] and there's people that are sitting in
[2:30:21] this building one way and they're going
[2:30:23] to leave another way
[2:30:37] maybe your heart is filled with sorrow
[2:30:39] let it be filled with joy
[2:30:42] maybe you need the Holy Ghost you can be
[2:30:44] so full until the devil don't know what
[2:30:46] to do with you
[2:30:49] whatever disease that you've got you
[2:30:52] came in one way you can walk out a
[2:30:54] different way
[2:30:57] I believe that with everything that is
[2:31:00] within me
[2:31:01] how strongly do you believe it brother
[2:31:04] Branham said when that little boy was
[2:31:06] laying there dead in Finland
[2:31:09] he said you could have lined up every
[2:31:11] devil in hell and they couldn't stop it
[2:31:15] brother Branham City Knew by the vision
[2:31:18] that that boy in just a few minutes was
[2:31:20] going to be off off of the ground and
[2:31:21] was going to be totally well
[2:31:30] it didn't matter what critic we're
[2:31:32] standing around him it don't matter what
[2:31:34] they say today ever never lined up but
[2:31:37] they couldn't stop it
[2:31:40] they can line up tonight but they can't
[2:31:42] stop what God wants to do for you
[2:31:58] maybe we could call her name Erica
[2:32:03] you can pull all the sheets you want to
[2:32:05] but when Jesus walks in the room
[2:32:12] she has a purpose and we remind God
[2:32:14] she has a purpose to be a wife
[2:32:17] to be a daughter
[2:32:19] to be a mother
[2:32:27] and we come to destroy the works of the
[2:32:29] devil
[2:32:31] [Music]
[2:32:32] brother you're afraid no I know what
[2:32:35] side I'm on
[2:32:51] I haven't found you yet sister Vicki but
[2:32:54] your pastor told me a few moments ago
[2:32:56] that but the Terry had been caught
[2:32:59] there you are pretty hot
[2:33:07] your pastor told me that
[2:33:09] your husband had been carrying you in
[2:33:11] and out of church the last couple of
[2:33:13] years
[2:33:14] but you know when you get well
[2:33:17] you become a socialite again
[2:33:21] and your husband winds up sitting in the
[2:33:23] car being impatient
[2:33:43] brother West we were in Pigeon Forge
[2:33:45] here months ago and you prayed that
[2:33:48] morning
[2:33:49] you know if we could get to brother Ryan
[2:33:51] have him pray for our daughter
[2:33:54] you know we're only about four or five
[2:33:56] hours away you've prayed for our
[2:33:57] daughter
[2:33:59] and your mother
[2:34:01] ran into sister Connie in a store
[2:34:04] and brother Ron was just a few stores
[2:34:07] down
[2:34:09] listen you go to Pigeon Forge there's
[2:34:11] two million people with you
[2:34:14] you go to other to relax and two million
[2:34:17] people went to the same spot
[2:34:20] he prays that prayer that morning
[2:34:23] and that morning we sat down and had
[2:34:25] plans
[2:34:28] and I told Connie I said you know I feel
[2:34:30] strange those plans won't work maybe we
[2:34:32] can do something different and so we did
[2:34:33] something different and we wound up at
[2:34:35] that mall
[2:34:37] even God goes to Tanger Mall
[2:34:39] [Applause]
[2:34:59] you can't orchestrate it
[2:35:03] you asked me to pray
[2:35:05] we didn't go somewhere secretly and
[2:35:08] privately
[2:35:09] we joined hands right there on the
[2:35:13] sidewalk
[2:35:15] I don't have a count but maybe 12 15 of
[2:35:18] us I'm not ashamed
[2:35:24] [Music]
[2:35:25] [Applause]
[2:35:38] I climbed into a car
[2:35:40] after a tent meeting
[2:35:42] and I'm done
[2:35:44] and when I climbed into the car
[2:35:47] they call me
[2:35:49] they said brother Ron there's a little
[2:35:51] girl in a wheelchair
[2:35:56] will you come and pray for her
[2:35:58] and I got back out of that car and I as
[2:36:00] I got out of the car I said she'll be
[2:36:02] well
[2:36:08] I walked under that tent
[2:36:11] her mother was not a Believer but she
[2:36:13] had heard about this meeting
[2:36:19] I took her feet into my hands
[2:36:23] and they were balled up
[2:36:26] and as I prayed
[2:36:28] I felt her feet release
[2:36:33] she said I believe I can walk
[2:36:34] [Applause]
[2:36:51] Jesus came to her house
[2:36:55] the interesting thing was
[2:36:59] brother jaw the interesting thing was as
[2:37:01] she was running
[2:37:03] I said God put it in your heart to bring
[2:37:06] her
[2:37:08] but he's really after you
[2:37:12] you're a pop music star and you need
[2:37:15] Jesus Christ I'd give that music up and
[2:37:17] give my life to Jesus Christ and she
[2:37:20] fell right in that moment and gave her
[2:37:22] her life to Jesus Christ
[2:37:36] one more can I give woman one more
[2:37:40] I was with brother Tom Ray
[2:37:44] and brother Murphy Wong
[2:37:46] and brother Glenn Bruner in China
[2:37:49] and we were preaching to hundreds of
[2:37:51] people
[2:37:52] and brother Tom told me said Don't wear
[2:37:54] a sports jacket don't wear a dress shirt
[2:37:56] don't wear a tie
[2:37:59] when I left when I was getting ready to
[2:38:02] leave the room
[2:38:03] the Lord spoke to me said find a tie
[2:38:09] I went up and down the hall of that
[2:38:11] hotel knocking on doors I didn't care
[2:38:14] who answered I needed to find a time
[2:38:21] I didn't know which room Glenn gruner
[2:38:23] was in and I knocked on his room he
[2:38:25] opened door said well you need brother
[2:38:27] and I said I need a tie
[2:38:29] he said we're not supposed to wear one I
[2:38:32] said the Lord told me to put on a tie he
[2:38:34] said I'll find one
[2:38:36] [Applause]
[2:38:42] my brother Tom met me in the elevator he
[2:38:44] said brother Ryan you're breaking the
[2:38:45] rules I said he told me he said good
[2:38:47] deal
[2:38:48] [Applause]
[2:38:56] I preached the sermon said we must get
[2:38:59] to Jesus
[2:39:05] at the end of that service it was a
[2:39:08] six-hour prayer line I'm not prophesying
[2:39:19] but before that prayer line ensued there
[2:39:22] was a woman
[2:39:25] crawls from the back of that building on
[2:39:27] her hands and knees
[2:39:30] she said she didn't feel worthy to stand
[2:39:33] and I was bent over praying for somebody
[2:39:35] else
[2:39:37] and she reached up and there's a picture
[2:39:39] somewhere with her fingers on my tie
[2:39:43] [Music]
[2:39:46] God note
[2:39:49] I had to have a tie on
[2:39:51] so she could touch it
[2:39:56] I wanna I got news for you she went home
[2:39:59] well
[2:40:13] all of us could stand here and give
[2:40:14] testimony for weeks and months
[2:40:17] we'll do that for the rest of our life
[2:40:20] not because that we're the Healer
[2:40:25] but because he is the Healer
[2:40:30] not because that we're the Savior but
[2:40:32] because he's the savior
[2:40:35] we're only his Representatives
[2:40:39] and we terrify Satan
[2:40:42] so we've come one more time
[2:40:45] to do it again
[2:40:50] not for a show
[2:40:54] we're not in the entertainment business
[2:40:58] but for his glory
[2:41:03] it is because your need
[2:41:06] has got his attention
[2:41:11] your need
[2:41:14] got his intention
[2:41:16] we started out this service
[2:41:19] by reminding you
[2:41:20] ask him to come to where you're sitting
[2:41:25] because we want your faith to be built
[2:41:29] not on a preacher
[2:41:31] but on God
[2:41:34] amen that when a minister does what he's
[2:41:35] called to do
[2:41:37] and commission to do
[2:41:39] by the act of laying on the hands
[2:41:44] that you believe
[2:41:46] that more than a man laid his hands on
[2:41:49] you
[2:41:50] that by the Society of the word of God
[2:41:54] the Eternal God
[2:41:56] The God That Never Fails
[2:42:00] if you can raise that faith enough to
[2:42:02] expect
[2:42:04] you can walk out of this building
[2:42:07] totally will
[2:42:13] you can walk out of here full of the
[2:42:15] Holy Ghost
[2:42:16] and that little question in your life
[2:42:22] I feel it even now that devil of Torment
[2:42:24] that's been worrying you in your mind
[2:42:26] and telling you lie after lie I want you
[2:42:29] to tell him he's defeated right now
[2:42:34] could we stand just now
[2:42:37] thank you for your patience with me
[2:42:44] Heavenly Father we stand here
[2:42:47] tonight
[2:42:53] we believe your word with all of our
[2:42:55] hearts
[2:42:57] we have felt your presence we've felt
[2:43:00] the world
[2:43:01] of the presence of the Lord
[2:43:06] your angels here
[2:43:09] you're among us
[2:43:11] you promised that you would be here and
[2:43:13] you keep all of your appointments
[2:43:16] now Lord we're like a little woman that
[2:43:19] sold all that she had and bought the
[2:43:21] best alabaster box that she could get
[2:43:25] Lord I want to give you my best I don't
[2:43:27] want to give you halfway
[2:43:30] Lord Jesus tonight there's many needs
[2:43:33] all through this building
[2:43:36] and I stand with men of God that have
[2:43:38] been commissioned
[2:43:40] by the greatest message that there's
[2:43:42] ever been
[2:43:44] father
[2:43:45] nobody can take brother branham's place
[2:43:49] but Lord Jesus we're we're under the
[2:43:52] same influence of that
[2:43:54] and we believe the same word
[2:43:57] now father
[2:43:59] Lord your children
[2:44:01] have incredible needs
[2:44:03] I do
[2:44:05] so I have expectation tonight to what
[2:44:08] regardless of what doctors have said
[2:44:12] that I can be well
[2:44:15] that I can preach hundreds more sermons
[2:44:18] not for my glory but for yours
[2:44:22] that I can be the father
[2:44:24] I can be the husband I can be a pastor
[2:44:28] not weakness but in strength
[2:44:31] Lord Jesus there's homes here
[2:44:34] that Satan's trying to wreck
[2:44:37] but they don't have to leave here like
[2:44:39] that
[2:44:40] Lord there's people here with all kinds
[2:44:43] of diseases
[2:44:44] but they don't have to leave here like
[2:44:46] that
[2:44:49] now Satan I know you're here as well
[2:44:52] but I want to remind you
[2:44:55] you don't have the keys to your house
[2:44:58] and you know that
[2:45:01] you have been stripped
[2:45:03] you have no bow no arrows for your pool
[2:45:08] you're a liar
[2:45:10] you're a buff
[2:45:12] and you're defeated in the name of the
[2:45:15] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:45:17] so father
[2:45:19] Lord Jesus as these children walk
[2:45:22] through this prayer line tonight

[2:45:30] to a level like never before
