[50:10] are what he can do in your life tonight

[51:29] meet that challenge father
[51:31] Lord I ask you to come and take over
[51:33] this vessel now and Speak Lord that you
[51:35] would have freedom Lord in my life right

[51:42] each and every need as Lord as our
[51:44] brother said last night only you can

[51:48] needs in a hundred different ways and

[51:54] thinking aside now and just Lord let you

[52:10] every heart that's gathered in Jesus
[52:11] name we pray amen amen
[52:14] thank you musicians wonderful singing
[52:17] tonight if you have your Bibles with you
[52:19] when we want to get straight into the
[52:21] word and look to the book of Jude the
[52:23] first chapter Jude the first chapter in
[52:25] the third verse and
[52:27] pray tonight our desire tonight is just
[52:29] to encourage you and strengthen you and
[52:31] the Lord that something would be said
[52:33] that
[52:34] would help us depress the battle for
[52:36] another day and and recognize our
[52:38] position and what we're called to be in
[52:40] this hour amen Jude 1 and verse 3.
[52:44] we're going to read one verse there and
[52:46] it says beloved
[52:48] when I gave all diligence to write unto
[52:51] you of the common salvation it was
[52:53] needful for me to write unto you and
[52:55] exhort you that you should earnestly
[52:58] contend for the faith which was once
[53:01] delivered unto the Saints and then also
[53:04] I want to read one verse out of Psalms
[53:06] the 60th chapter Psalm 60 and verse 4.
[53:10] and it says thou has given a banner to
[53:13] them that feare thee that it may be
[53:16] displayed because of the truth
[53:19] Selah amen I pray that the Lord will add
[53:22] His blessings to the reading of this
[53:24] word as you have your seats
[53:30] I'd like to speak to you tonight for for
[53:32] a little
[53:33] for a little while on the topic of
[53:35] raising the standard
[53:37] raising the standard brother Branham
[53:40] says and and as we read this quote I
[53:42] want you to just take each and every
[53:43] portion of it and apply it to yourself
[53:46] and and think about yourself and think
[53:48] about this these young people and how
[53:49] that we can take this there's so much he
[53:51] says here he says God grant it tonight
[53:55] everything has went by May that still
[53:58] Small Voice attract the people tonight
[54:01] to a real Sanctified life
[54:04] a life that will stand by their God
[54:07] that'll stand by their Church that'll
[54:10] stand by their Pastor that'll stand by
[54:13] the cause of Christ that will hold up a
[54:16] banner that'll live act dress go and
[54:21] Associate and live in the environment
[54:23] that'll be so salty that it'll cause
[54:26] others to thirst to be like them
[54:31] amen early on we see there in the in the
[54:34] book of Jude early on that that Jude is
[54:36] having to write and to encourage the
[54:38] Believers to contend for the faith which
[54:42] was once delivered and if you look into
[54:44] the dates this is literally only a few
[54:46] years removed from the original
[54:48] outpouring there of the baptism of the
[54:50] Holy Ghost there there in the upper room
[54:52] at Pentecost and already what they had
[54:55] been given is already under attack and I
[54:59] want you to know that there has been a
[55:00] word revealed in this day and restored
[55:03] back to the original and yet I want you
[55:05] to know that it's under attack and the
[55:07] devil would love nothing more than to
[55:09] take from you what God has given you
[55:11] what is rightfully yours but tonight
[55:14] somebody is called to raise the standard
[55:16] there is a group of people called to
[55:18] stand and defend what has been returned
[55:20] to you and make sure that no man takes
[55:23] that away from you you understand it is
[55:25] yours you can have it you can have
[55:27] exactly what they had in the book of
[55:29] Acts you can have exactly what your
[55:31] parents parents got what your
[55:32] grandparents got brother Branham taught
[55:34] us that every generation has an
[55:36] opportunity at Revival so let no man
[55:39] steal your Revival it is for you to have
[55:42] but you're going to have to be willing
[55:43] to fight for it you're going to have to
[55:45] be willing to go to battle and what Jude
[55:48] is talking about here is that men had
[55:51] already crept in and began changing
[55:53] ideas and saying what they needed and
[55:56] didn't need and how they could act and
[55:57] how they couldn't worship and that's
[55:59] always the problem once man gets
[56:01] involved once man gets his ideas in it
[56:04] but we have something we have a we can
[56:06] look to it's a standard and this is our
[56:08] standard that we look to we know what
[56:11] the Holy Ghost does we know how the Holy
[56:13] Ghost acts we know the life that the
[56:15] Holy Ghost will cause you to live and we
[56:17] can look to that tonight as our standard
[56:20] and man began to come in and change
[56:22] things and begin to Rob what it was that
[56:25] belonged to the people
[56:27] and Jude is calling on people here in
[56:30] this moment he's calling them to contend
[56:32] he's saying you're going to have to
[56:34] fight for what was once given in other
[56:36] words it's already changing but if you
[56:39] want it the way it was originally you're
[56:41] gonna have to contend for it you're
[56:43] going to have to fight for it
[56:46] and he's saying it's up to you he says
[56:48] Brothers earnestly contend this isn't
[56:50] going to be an easy battle this isn't
[56:52] going to be something like well that's
[56:53] my he's saying it you're gonna have to
[56:54] be Earnest about it you're going to have
[56:56] to take hold of it you're going to have
[56:58] to be willing to stand and today there
[57:01] is another call that has gone out and
[57:03] saying was there someone in this day
[57:05] that will stand for the truth yes a
[57:07] messenger came yes the seals were broken
[57:10] off yes the word is available to you but
[57:12] are you willing to contend for it are
[57:14] you willing to stand for it are you
[57:16] willing to be one that's not ashamed to
[57:18] say I've had my heart turned back to the
[57:21] original I'm going to stand on it
[57:22] because I know this is what's going to
[57:24] take us in a Rapture and I will let no
[57:27] man rob it from me I will let no cold
[57:29] formal worship come in and take over our
[57:31] services but we're going to be on fire
[57:33] for God this bride will by no means be a
[57:36] lukewarm broad she'll be on fire she'll
[57:39] be going forward as Onward Christian
[57:41] Soldier but somebody's got to stand and
[57:45] contend for it in this day okay
[57:48] Hallelujah
[57:50] someone who will fight for the truth
[57:52] that has been restored back
[57:54] and not only defend
[57:57] but to take steps to take more
[58:01] not only defend what you've already
[58:03] taken but to take steps to take all that
[58:06] God has given us in this day
[58:08] and as I think about
[58:10] the ranks of the people that we might
[58:12] would refer to as message Believers and
[58:14] I think of our youth and I I think of
[58:17] each and every one of us
[58:18] we have an obligation
[58:21] an obligation to fight and to defend
[58:24] what God has to fight for and defend
[58:26] what God has done in this day and not
[58:30] just in the sense of defending the
[58:31] message the message does a good job of
[58:34] Defending itself because it's truth
[58:36] but also but defending what God has done
[58:40] for us personally
[58:42] defending our experience defending our
[58:45] rights what it is that God has done for
[58:48] us and not allow the devil to come in
[58:50] and Rob what God has given you
[58:53] because young people God has given you
[58:55] more than we could ever stand here and
[58:57] say here he has delivered as he has
[58:59] healed us he has given us the Salvation
[59:01] he has given us the Holy Ghost he has
[59:03] brought us from place to Victory to
[59:05] Victory to Victory and yet if you allow
[59:07] the devil will come in and and give you
[59:09] a woe as me and I'm a failure and I
[59:12] haven't done much but you've got to look
[59:13] back to each and every Victory and every
[59:15] time you have a victory young people
[59:17] drive down a stake right there drive
[59:19] down a stake right there and don't ever
[59:21] go behind that stake ever again you may
[59:24] struggle to go forward but after that
[59:25] step put down another state and then
[59:27] after that step put down another state
[59:29] and never go beyond that last state
[59:32] never back off your testimony never
[59:35] begin to speak what the devil says but I
[59:37] am a Son of God I am Blood Bought I am
[59:40] Blood Washed I do have the Holy Ghost I
[59:43] am an overcomer let that be your
[59:45] testimony from this day forward
[59:47] [Applause]
[59:49] and defend what God has given you
[59:53] as individuals
[59:55] we have to be fortified
[59:57] and make sure we stay behind and stay
[1:00:00] clothed in the whole armor of the word
[1:00:03] tucked away behind his word and we have
[1:00:05] to
[1:00:06] not just for us but even as we spoke
[1:00:08] last night rebuild the walls around our
[1:00:10] families
[1:00:11] rebuild the walls around our loved ones
[1:00:14] and and push back to the landmarks that
[1:00:17] many have been driven away from
[1:00:19] things that are promised there in the
[1:00:21] word that that people haven't haven't
[1:00:22] reached to in so long we've got to begin
[1:00:24] to push back and take back the land that
[1:00:26] belongs to us in this day
[1:00:28] use the word to rebuild areas in our
[1:00:31] life that may be there they're weaker
[1:00:33] than other areas we all have strengths
[1:00:34] and weaknesses
[1:00:36] fortify your weaknesses in the word
[1:00:40] focus on those things and fortify them
[1:00:42] and build up areas that maybe you have
[1:00:44] neglected
[1:00:46] many times we have neglected areas in
[1:00:48] our life and we need to find those areas
[1:00:50] and cover them with the Holy Ghost keep
[1:00:52] them covered in the word don't allow
[1:00:54] yourself in your weaknesses to be
[1:00:56] exposed to the enemy
[1:00:58] build those areas back up and we must
[1:01:00] take time to nurture our experience into
[1:01:04] true relationship
[1:01:07] think about that we believe and we teach
[1:01:10] and experience you must have the
[1:01:12] experience of meeting God for yourself
[1:01:14] but then we have to nurture that
[1:01:16] experience into relationship because if
[1:01:18] it's a one-time experience
[1:01:21] then you don't have relationship
[1:01:24] if I meet you one time and then I never
[1:01:27] speak to you again I never commune you
[1:01:29] with you again I never talk to you we
[1:01:31] don't call we don't text we don't visit
[1:01:33] we don't have a relationship
[1:01:37] even though we had an encounter
[1:01:41] but I will tell you once you encounter
[1:01:43] this Pillar of Fire you will want to
[1:01:45] have a relationship with it it is
[1:01:47] something that you will want more of and
[1:01:49] more of and more of listen if you don't
[1:01:52] have a desire for more I question
[1:01:53] whether you ever encountered it to begin
[1:01:55] with because once you come into the
[1:01:57] presence of this Pillar of Fire your
[1:02:00] heart will yearn for more amen
[1:02:03] Hallelujah
[1:02:04] our experience isn't to be a a one and
[1:02:07] done thing but we are to walk with him
[1:02:09] daily
[1:02:11] going from experience to experience ever
[1:02:14] growing Ever Changing
[1:02:17] ever contending
[1:02:19] ever being willing to be molded
[1:02:22] continually putting this Stone upon this
[1:02:24] Stone and this Stone upon this Stone and
[1:02:27] allow Allowing God to mold out this
[1:02:30] weakness Allowing God to strengthen Us
[1:02:32] in this area and allowing him to change
[1:02:34] Us in that area never getting to the
[1:02:36] place to where we feel like we've
[1:02:38] arrived
[1:02:40] I'm there I'm a message believer I met
[1:02:42] God I'm good
[1:02:44] that's not a place you want to get into
[1:02:46] young people
[1:02:47] but praying Lord shake me again tonight
[1:02:50] Lord shake me to my very core once again
[1:02:54] tonight Lord show me where I need you
[1:02:56] tonight because every one of us have
[1:02:58] need of him but Lord show me where it is
[1:03:01] show me where I need to grow show me
[1:03:03] what you're trying to tell pour out
[1:03:04] yourself more into my life Lord Jesus
[1:03:08] prophet of God would say it like this he
[1:03:10] says God we're not so anxious tonight to
[1:03:12] see the building shook
[1:03:15] now listen I love it when the power of
[1:03:16] God sweeps sweeps through a place and it
[1:03:19] almost feels like you can feel the
[1:03:20] building breathing
[1:03:22] it's just so alive with the power of God
[1:03:24] but listen we're not so interested or
[1:03:26] anxious tonight to see the building
[1:03:28] shook but we would like for you to shake
[1:03:31] us Lord
[1:03:32] Shake our understanding Shake our being
[1:03:36] our emotion our hearts of understanding
[1:03:40] that we might leave here tonight more
[1:03:42] determined than ever to serve you that
[1:03:45] we might feel the presence of a new
[1:03:48] Fresh Pentecost of a holy spirit pouring
[1:03:51] out upon us afreshing a new like down in
[1:03:53] these woods and hills in Arkansas 50
[1:03:55] years ago when the forefathers come
[1:03:57] through here in horses and wagons
[1:03:59] preaching this gospel dear Lord may we
[1:04:02] the bearers of this great worthy cause
[1:04:05] that you sent through here may we not be
[1:04:08] ashamed of this great thing but may we
[1:04:10] walk in the footsteps of those who went
[1:04:12] before us Lord packing the banner
[1:04:16] of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:18] raising the standard packing the banner
[1:04:21] of the Lord Jesus we've got to come to
[1:04:24] the place young people to where we are
[1:04:26] solid
[1:04:27] yet seeking
[1:04:32] to where we're solid yet seeking to
[1:04:34] where we are examples and yet teachable
[1:04:40] to where we are leaders and yet we're
[1:04:43] willing to be changed
[1:04:45] to the to the place to where listen
[1:04:47] these two things are not exclusive

[1:05:23] need more of you tonight Lord

[1:05:27] but see this is where the Devil comes in
[1:05:28] and he begins to try to rob you
[1:05:31] when we acknowledge our need of more of
[1:05:33] God than he says yep see you didn't have
[1:05:36] it
[1:05:38] yep see you didn't have what you thought
[1:05:40] you had
[1:05:41] but that's not the truth
[1:05:43] there isn't there has to be an
[1:05:45] acknowledgment when he comes in and
[1:05:46] points to your weaknesses

[1:06:38] devil's thoughts

[1:06:43] that's not the time young people to back

[1:06:48] what you're right yeah I've been having
[1:06:50] these struggles I've been having these
[1:06:52] issues I've been having those battles

[1:07:01] Calvary that's what I point to him to a
[1:07:03] changed life to a changed attitude to my
[1:07:05] victories I point him to where I

[1:07:36] that point the enemy there and yet that

[1:07:44] that that the Lord's still working on me
[1:07:47] that I have walls that I need to build
[1:07:49] up that there is areas in my life that I
[1:07:52] need to mature in

[1:14:34] you're still standing in the
[1:14:36] championship rounds
[1:14:38] think about it
[1:14:40] a lot of people can get in the ring and
[1:14:41] fight for a round
[1:14:43] a lot of people can stay through the
[1:14:45] first few rounds but there's something
[1:14:46] called the championship rounds
[1:14:48] it's where you're still standing at the
[1:14:50] very end
[1:14:51] you're still standing
[1:14:54] in the devil's Throne every punch he can
[1:14:55] throw he's hit you with everything he's
[1:14:57] got
[1:14:58] surely they're about to go down

[1:15:13] corner says I'm answering the Bell I'm
[1:15:15] here for another round I'm here to stand
[1:15:17] Toe to Toe with the Enemy that's you
[1:15:19] tonight you were in the championship
[1:15:20] rounds and I believe that the enemy I
[1:15:22] believe with all my heart is on the
[1:15:24] verge of going down we're about to
[1:15:26] deliver the knockout Blow The Rapture of
[1:15:28] the church is just at hand
[1:15:30] you can feel Time and Eternity beginning
[1:15:33] to blend you see it all around us as
[1:15:35] listen you can see the evil blending in
[1:15:38] from that from that other dimension
[1:15:39] brother Branham says we talk so much
[1:15:41] about how bad the world's getting them
[1:15:43] how evil the world's getting he says yet
[1:15:45] we fail to see how strong the church is
[1:15:47] getting all the time I'm telling you
[1:15:50] you're stronger than the devil's been
[1:15:51] telling you you're stronger than he's
[1:15:53] been saying but if you look to the word
[1:15:55] if you'll feed him the word you'll find
[1:15:57] that you're a mighty Army you're an
[1:15:59] invincible Army that you're Overcomers
[1:16:01] that you are the victors in this day
[1:16:04] it's time to look back to the standard
[1:16:07] Hallelujah
[1:16:10] foreign
[1:16:11] what did the chief Captain think of you
[1:16:15] he thought so much of you that he's
[1:16:16] called you to be a standard Bearer in
[1:16:18] this day
[1:16:19] someone who would carry the standard
[1:16:22] someone who would see this thing through
[1:16:24] to the end
[1:16:26] someone who would lift up the word of
[1:16:28] God in the most evil day that's ever
[1:16:29] been
[1:16:31] he chose you
[1:16:34] Prophet says like this he says but in
[1:16:35] every generation God has always had his
[1:16:37] agents it's got down sometimes to merely
[1:16:40] one but God always had somebody in every
[1:16:42] generation that he could lay his finger
[1:16:44] on some people that he could put his
[1:16:46] finger on and say this is my people and
[1:16:49] they'll do as I tell them to do
[1:16:53] he looks around he says I need a young
[1:16:55] people
[1:16:56] who won't bow down to the pressures of
[1:16:58] the age
[1:16:59] I need believers who will proclaim the
[1:17:01] truths of the word I need somebody in
[1:17:04] the worst conditions that's ever been
[1:17:05] that would be willing to stand and
[1:17:07] willing to fight when they're completely
[1:17:09] surrounded
[1:17:11] when there's absolutely no hope
[1:17:13] when there's absolutely total darkness
[1:17:15] when others are caving to the pressures
[1:17:17] of the age when others are turning and
[1:17:19] walking away when others is going to
[1:17:21] quit who's he going to pick
[1:17:24] they all know when God looks down
[1:17:26] through time and could have picked
[1:17:27] anyone
[1:17:28] could have placed anybody here knowing
[1:17:31] all things knowing who could take it he
[1:17:33] said who are my very best
[1:17:35] who can I trust who am I going to let
[1:17:38] run the last leg
[1:17:40] maybe in in carnal terms who are my Navy
[1:17:42] Seals
[1:17:44] who are my Army Rangers who's the ones
[1:17:46] that I can send in for the final battle
[1:17:48] and he looks all down through Eternal
[1:17:51] eternity and he says I Choose You
[1:17:54] I Choose You
[1:17:56] that's a little different from what the
[1:17:58] devil's been telling you God looked at
[1:18:00] you and you said you're the very best of
[1:18:02] God you're the ones I'm going to hand
[1:18:04] the Baton to for the close of the race
[1:18:07] you're the ones I've got faith that I
[1:18:09] know will stand that I know will contend
[1:18:11] and he looks down Through the Ages and
[1:18:13] the devil says you're no good you're
[1:18:14] nobody you're worthless and God says I
[1:18:17] Choose You
[1:18:18] I Choose You Tonight
[1:18:20] it's time that we begin to Echo the
[1:18:23] testimony of our God and say he chose me
[1:18:25] he chose me he chose me for this age and
[1:18:29] I'm not going to let the standard fall
[1:18:31] it's not going to go to the ground in my
[1:18:33] day but I'm going to raise it up he
[1:18:35] chose me
[1:18:37] Hallelujah
[1:18:39] who can I give the colors to for the
[1:18:41] final charge into eternity
[1:18:44] think about that responsibility
[1:18:46] but think about the confidence that he
[1:18:48] has in you
[1:18:49] Hallelujah sure there's people falling
[1:18:52] away
[1:18:54] there's people letting down the
[1:18:55] standards people are allowing ancient
[1:18:57] landmarks to be moved
[1:18:59] allowing ancient landmarks to be overrun
[1:19:02] people sit by with breeches in the wall
[1:19:05] they don't rebuild the wall they don't
[1:19:07] repair it they see breeches in the holes
[1:19:09] in the wall and they just they just
[1:19:10] leave them uncared for and the gaps in
[1:19:14] the walls through the years have allowed
[1:19:15] the standards to go out
[1:19:18] and then be replaced by the ideas of man
[1:19:21] you see not only to do broken down walls
[1:19:23] allow the enemy in
[1:19:26] but allow things out
[1:19:30] notice it's hard for the evil to get in
[1:19:32] if the standard is there
[1:19:34] the evil can't get in if it's filled
[1:19:36] with the standard
[1:19:38] but when standards go out evils come in
[1:19:42] who's going to build the wall
[1:19:45] who's going to get back on the wall
[1:19:49] what
[1:19:51] that's our first instinct
[1:19:53] somebody somebody probably Brother
[1:19:55] Joseph that's trained
[1:19:57] probably some preachers
[1:20:01] sure we have our part
[1:20:03] well probably the great singers and the
[1:20:05] deacons man that
[1:20:07] who's going to rebuild the wall
[1:20:12] you're gonna do it
[1:20:13] but you don't understand brother and I'm
[1:20:15] just a young person what can I do
[1:20:17] I'm just a young person
[1:20:21] let's look at Nehemiah 3 28 I love this
[1:20:24] he says from above the horse gate
[1:20:26] repaired the priest everyone over
[1:20:28] against his house
[1:20:29] after them repaired zadok the son of
[1:20:31] Amber over against his house
[1:20:33] after him repaired also shamaya the son
[1:20:36] of Shekinah The Keeper of the East Gate
[1:20:39] in verse 30 after him repaired hananiah
[1:20:42] the son of shalimaya and Hanan the sixth
[1:20:45] son of zelath another piece after him
[1:20:48] repaired mashulum the son of
[1:20:51] barakaya sorry over against his chamber
[1:20:55] now notice down through every one of
[1:20:58] these verses it said the son of
[1:21:00] the son of
[1:21:02] the son of and then it gets to verse 30
[1:21:04] and it says the sixth son
[1:21:10] it's very specific here it didn't matter
[1:21:12] that the five Elder Brothers didn't want
[1:21:14] to put their hand to the word
[1:21:16] it didn't matter that the five older
[1:21:19] ones didn't want to do it it didn't
[1:21:21] matter that they were okay with gaps in
[1:21:23] the wall
[1:21:24] it didn't matter that the five older
[1:21:26] ones were okay with cold formal Worship
[1:21:28] in the church
[1:21:30] it didn't matter if the old head sat on
[1:21:32] their hands when the worship went forth
[1:21:34] oh come on it's okay it didn't matter
[1:21:37] the young one the young person said hey
[1:21:39] it's okay I see something that needs to
[1:21:41] be done I'll step up I'll build I'll
[1:21:44] fill it in I'll worship God when the
[1:21:47] service is going on I'll create an
[1:21:49] atmosphere I don't care if you do I
[1:21:51] don't care if you do I don't care if you
[1:21:53] do but I'll create an atmosphere I'll
[1:21:56] worship my king I'll worship my God I
[1:21:59] got a part to play I may be the sixth
[1:22:01] son I may be 12 13 14. but I can do my
[1:22:05] part to rebuild the wall to create an
[1:22:08] atmosphere where others receive the Holy
[1:22:10] Ghost where others get blessed I'm gonna
[1:22:13] hold up a standard you have a part to
[1:22:16] play
[1:22:17] I'll uphold the standards
[1:22:20] it doesn't matter how young I am I'll do
[1:22:23] it
[1:22:24] others may not put their hands to the
[1:22:26] work
[1:22:27] listen let no man despise thy youth
[1:22:30] don't worry about if you're 12 15 16.
[1:22:33] you have just as much apart to play in
[1:22:35] the services here as anyone
[1:22:39] as a matter of fact I can only speak for
[1:22:41] my church but I'll say when our youth
[1:22:43] are gone
[1:22:44] to like a youth camp or something
[1:22:47] it's sad
[1:22:51] the worship service is just
[1:22:53] different
[1:22:55] you want to be careful you'll be
[1:22:57] disrespectful to the elders and such I'm
[1:22:59] just saying
[1:23:00] when they're gone we know it
[1:23:03] you have a huge part to play
[1:23:06] well what can I do I'm not a preacher
[1:23:08] you are the creator of atmospheres
[1:23:11] you have the opportunity to welcome the
[1:23:13] King of Kings into this place as he's
[1:23:15] moving through this sanctuary and do
[1:23:17] your part
[1:23:20] listen I think about Lazarus
[1:23:22] and then when he was raised from the
[1:23:24] tune and Jesus told them that the
[1:23:27] sisters to go roll the stone away he
[1:23:28] could have easily just rolled it away
[1:23:30] listen it may not be your service
[1:23:33] it may not be the day that you're risen
[1:23:35] from the dead you may be feeling just
[1:23:36] fine you may be where you need to be but
[1:23:38] somebody's got to be willing to push on
[1:23:40] the stone because that dead person
[1:23:42] sitting next to you it may be their day
[1:23:44] to be raised it may be their day to be
[1:23:46] delivered and somebody's got to be
[1:23:47] willing to go hey I don't care if
[1:23:49] anybody notices I don't care if I get an
[1:23:51] award that ain't what it's about but I'm
[1:23:53] gonna push on this Stone I'm Gonna
[1:23:55] Worship I'm gonna do my part I'm gonna
[1:23:57] make sure that if somebody needs
[1:23:59] something from God today there's no
[1:24:01] hindrance between them there's no
[1:24:03] atmosphere of cold formalness but in
[1:24:06] here our God can move he can deliver I'm
[1:24:09] Gonna Roll the stones away from my
[1:24:12] brother and sister
[1:24:13] there's a part you can play
[1:24:18] this quote says his five Elder Brothers
[1:24:20] it seems laid not their hand to the work
[1:24:23] but he did in doing that which is good
[1:24:26] we don't have to wait to see our elders
[1:24:28] go before us
[1:24:31] you don't got to wait to see if Mama
[1:24:33] worships
[1:24:38] if mama won't leave him daddy don't have
[1:24:40] family altar you can have family altered
[1:24:44] you can do what is good
[1:24:48] it says if they decline it it doesn't
[1:24:50] mean we have to
[1:24:51] thus the younger brother if he be the
[1:24:54] better man and does God and His
[1:24:56] generation better service is indeed the
[1:24:58] better gentleman you can tell this was
[1:25:00] written in the 1800s
[1:25:02] those are most honorable that are most
[1:25:05] useful
[1:25:07] listen they can turn things down they
[1:25:08] don't have to take it all but there is a
[1:25:10] generation of people who's going to take
[1:25:12] everything
[1:25:14] that's going to claim everything that
[1:25:15] God has given them listen the older ones
[1:25:18] wouldn't kill Goliath brother Joe
[1:25:21] the older ones hit in their tent
[1:25:25] the older ones just said you know
[1:25:27] be careful
[1:25:30] the old ones sat there all day in their
[1:25:32] tent comparing quotes
[1:25:34] I decided not to be careful
[1:25:38] just all day comparing quotes and and
[1:25:40] comparing this and
[1:25:43] there was a giant out there taking their
[1:25:45] property there was a giant out there
[1:25:47] robbing their Joy there was a giant out
[1:25:49] there saying you can't have your kids
[1:25:50] back you can't have the baptism of the
[1:25:52] Holy Ghost you can't have the gifts
[1:25:54] moving in the service you can't have
[1:25:56] freedom of worship well this quote says
[1:26:01] is he still out there yep let's look up
[1:26:04] some more
[1:26:07] but there was a young person brother
[1:26:08] Brown said I love the way he said it he
[1:26:10] said his boast fell on the wrong set of
[1:26:13] ears and I'm telling you there may be
[1:26:14] others that want to go around and around
[1:26:16] the mountain there may be others I just
[1:26:18] want to read quotes and read quotes and
[1:26:19] I love quotes as much as everybody else
[1:26:21] but there's a generation of people that
[1:26:23] says I'm gonna take that quote and I'm
[1:26:25] gonna put it in action and I'm gonna put
[1:26:26] it in my slingshot and I'm gonna go out
[1:26:28] there to this giant that's been robbing
[1:26:30] my joy robbing my peace robbing my
[1:26:33] freedom and I'm going out there to take
[1:26:34] his head off I'm taking the land I'm
[1:26:37] taking the Rapture that's my Valley
[1:26:39] that's my property and I will no longer
[1:26:42] sit by in the tent and let him March
[1:26:44] around on the Promises of God but there
[1:26:46] is a young people today saying that's
[1:26:49] mine get off my land get off my property
[1:26:52] oh come on there's a lot of people got
[1:26:55] the got the rock in the sling and
[1:26:57] they've done this too long it's time to
[1:26:59] turn and lose today let the rock go to
[1:27:02] its Target let it take the Giant in your
[1:27:04] life down
[1:27:05] Hallelujah
[1:27:10] brother Brown says no wonder
[1:27:11] Christianity can't even lift up a
[1:27:13] standard
[1:27:14] he said it's not because Christ is not
[1:27:17] able
[1:27:18] but because people won't do it
[1:27:22] he said the message is ready
[1:27:25] the power of God is sufficient
[1:27:28] men and women are scared to break out
[1:27:30] yonder into those spheres before God
[1:27:33] and dare to trust him
[1:27:36] and take his word
[1:27:38] there's a people called
[1:27:41] to trust him
[1:27:43] to take his word
[1:27:45] and to hold up the standard of the word
[1:27:48] listen you can't give an inch
[1:27:51] you cannot be willing
[1:27:54] to give an inch
[1:27:57] we're not called to be compromisers
[1:28:00] we're not called to be blenders
[1:28:03] we're called to be separators
[1:28:06] we're called to be Defenders
[1:28:09] we can't expect to be Victorious and
[1:28:11] continue to be wishy-washy about things
[1:28:15] every little bit of it matters
[1:28:18] every little bit of your property
[1:28:20] matters
[1:28:21] I mean think about it
[1:28:23] your dad gets up and the alarm goes off
[1:28:25] and he looks out in the backyard and
[1:28:26] there's an intruder out there sneaking
[1:28:28] around with a ski mask on and he said I
[1:28:31] don't worry about it he's just in the
[1:28:32] yard
[1:28:35] he's not even at the door
[1:28:38] he's daddy's getting closer yeah I'm not
[1:28:41] even sure his gun's loaded all right
[1:28:43] y'all just rest don't worry about it
[1:28:46] that would be insanity
[1:28:49] why we want to wait till he's inside the
[1:28:50] house
[1:28:52] why you want to wait till he's taking
[1:28:54] taking everything from you listen you
[1:28:56] see him stick a foot on your property
[1:28:58] it's time to deal with it right then sir
[1:29:00] you have no right to be here you have no
[1:29:03] rights on in my life every right you
[1:29:05] ever had was stripped from you that day
[1:29:07] on Calvary you've got to go and if you
[1:29:09] don't go I'm going to call the authority
[1:29:11] on you you've got to get out of my life
[1:29:13] take your depression take your anxiety
[1:29:16] take your lies and your fears and get
[1:29:18] out of my life this is my property it's
[1:29:21] vote it's paid for the deed has been
[1:29:24] searched it belongs to me he has no
[1:29:26] rights deal with it right now
[1:29:29] because if you give an edge you open
[1:29:31] yourself up to the bottomless pit
[1:29:35] it is a bottomless pit
[1:29:38] and when you give in to that
[1:29:42] the world presents us a very dangerous
[1:29:45] situation it's a very dangerous attitude
[1:29:47] of just be willing to compromise a
[1:29:49] little
[1:29:50] just be willing to say things a little
[1:29:52] softer
[1:29:53] just be willing to baby things a little
[1:29:55] bit for the sake of getting along
[1:29:58] and once you give an inch
[1:30:00] once you compromise a little bit before
[1:30:03] you know it you're completely overtaken
[1:30:06] listen you should thank God
[1:30:08] that you have the opportunity to come to
[1:30:10] a place
[1:30:11] we're a pastor is not afraid to speak
[1:30:13] the truth
[1:30:15] who isn't afraid of offending someone
[1:30:17] for the sake of for the sake of Truth
[1:30:21] a place where truth is spoken and held
[1:30:23] up where the standard is held high and
[1:30:25] we're not going to back up we're not
[1:30:26] going to Cave to the pressures we're not
[1:30:28] going to Cave to to the thought that we
[1:30:31] have to you know not offend anyone
[1:30:32] listen we're going to speak the truth
[1:30:34] we are going to say the truth I I can't
[1:30:36] help if it hurts your feelings there's
[1:30:37] the saying that that the truth don't
[1:30:40] care about your feelings
[1:30:41] the truth is just the truth and I'm
[1:30:44] thankful for men of God that are still
[1:30:45] willing to stand and isn't afraid to say
[1:30:47] how it is and call right right and wrong
[1:30:49] wrong
[1:30:53] 1996 I'm fixing to date myself again
[1:30:59] we had a president by the name of Bill
[1:31:01] Clinton
[1:31:02] at the time and he was considered the
[1:31:05] liberal of liberals
[1:31:09] he would almost be a conservative today
[1:31:12] but he was considered the liberal
[1:31:15] of liberals like
[1:31:17] man this wasn't good
[1:31:19] Bill Clinton is the president
[1:31:22] let me tell you how much things have
[1:31:23] changed if you keep up with politics at
[1:31:26] all I know you probably don't but here's
[1:31:28] a quick lesson
[1:31:30] Bill Clinton
[1:31:32] signed the defense Marriage Act brother
[1:31:34] Joe
[1:31:36] saying that marriage was between a man
[1:31:38] and a woman
[1:31:41] this was what the Liberals were passing
[1:31:43] when I was your age
[1:31:48] marriage has to be between a man and a
[1:31:51] woman
[1:31:52] and for years they cried oh we just we
[1:31:55] treated the same
[1:32:03] we just want to be we just want to love
[1:32:05] each other like everybody else we don't
[1:32:07] want to bother nobody you know the
[1:32:09] liberal rallying cry love love love
[1:32:12] we just want to get married like
[1:32:14] everybody else and you won't hear from
[1:32:16] us anymore
[1:32:17] see what it was is there was a standard
[1:32:19] in their way
[1:32:21] that kept them from being able to fully
[1:32:23] manifest the full extent of wickedness
[1:32:26] that was to come
[1:32:28] it was the standard of marriage
[1:32:32] they always want to move the standard
[1:32:34] they want to overrun the landmarks they
[1:32:36] want to make a mockery of anything that
[1:32:38] is an institution of God
[1:32:42] so in 2015 more up to your speed
[1:32:46] the Supreme Court overruled the marriage
[1:32:48] protection act giving
[1:32:51] these people the right to marry
[1:32:54] and from that time on has that been all
[1:32:56] they wanted
[1:32:58] no
[1:32:59] it's been a constant flood
[1:33:03] from the pits of Hell a flood an
[1:33:04] absolute unraveling of the standards of
[1:33:06] society that was once one nation under
[1:33:09] God
[1:33:11] how far
[1:33:13] I don't mean to gross you out but I'm
[1:33:14] just gonna I'm gonna give you some
[1:33:16] honesty right here here's where we're at
[1:33:17] as a society
[1:33:20] there is now a movement to no longer use
[1:33:22] the term pedophile
[1:33:24] to describe those people who want sexual
[1:33:27] activity with children brother Joe
[1:33:30] because in using that term you may
[1:33:32] offend them
[1:33:37] I'm not making this up
[1:33:39] in the academic world especially in the
[1:33:41] liberal universities there's a very big
[1:33:43] push to no longer use the word pedophile
[1:33:46] because it creates a negative stigma
[1:33:48] around them
[1:33:49] we now are supposed to call them
[1:33:52] map that's capital m capital a capital P
[1:33:55] which stands for minor attracted persons
[1:34:01] um
[1:34:04] I want you to let that set settle for
[1:34:06] just a minute
[1:34:09] brother Aaron why are y'all so hard on
[1:34:10] this why you preach so hard against
[1:34:12] these things why do you preach against
[1:34:14] the the worldly entertainment why do you
[1:34:16] preach why are you so hard why can't you
[1:34:18] just give a little bit
[1:34:20] why can't you just budge a little why is
[1:34:22] everything I be so cut and dry because
[1:34:24] when you give a little bit it opens you
[1:34:27] up to a bottomless pit toward the smoke
[1:34:29] of Hell's coming out and get listen
[1:34:31] young people you don't want to give a
[1:34:32] little bit you don't want to back up
[1:34:34] even a little but raise the standards
[1:34:37] that won't move I won't bow I won't
[1:34:39] break that's not coming in my home
[1:34:41] that's not coming for my children no sir
[1:34:45] but we stand on the standard of the word
[1:34:47] of God whoever it may offend whoever it
[1:34:50] may upset there's a standard and I will
[1:34:53] raise it huh
[1:34:55] Hallelujah
[1:34:58] you can't give even a little bit
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:07] changing standards leads to no standards
[1:35:13] we look to this one and that one we
[1:35:15] think this is cool and that's cool or
[1:35:17] this movie star and this athlete
[1:35:19] everybody wants to match up with
[1:35:21] somebody or copy somebody
[1:35:23] brother Branham said I don't care if my
[1:35:25] coat matches my trousers or my tie
[1:35:27] matches anything as long as my
[1:35:29] experience matches this word you want to
[1:35:31] blend with something you want to match
[1:35:33] something you want to be like somebody
[1:35:35] find it right here make sure you match
[1:35:38] this make sure you line up to this this
[1:35:41] is what matters young people
[1:35:44] this is what we must emulate
[1:35:46] this is the standard that we must look
[1:35:49] to we must begin to we have to allow it
[1:35:51] to manifest in our lives
[1:35:54] to where that word begins to take on
[1:35:56] flesh to where
[1:35:58] you become
[1:36:00] that standard
[1:36:02] Taurus no longer just on paper
[1:36:05] it's no longer Just Books and tapes
[1:36:08] it has to begin to take on a living form
[1:36:10] a breathing form
[1:36:13] a bride walking not a bride in books
[1:36:18] but the standard begins to take on flesh
[1:36:21] because we're called to uphold the
[1:36:23] standard a standard against sin
[1:36:25] and if things need to be addressed they
[1:36:27] get addressed if things need to be
[1:36:29] preached on they get preached on
[1:36:32] come on now we're getting soft
[1:36:35] we're getting to the place to where oh
[1:36:37] he's going to offend my kitty
[1:36:39] he's going to hurt my little boy
[1:36:43] he was preaching right to my family
[1:36:46] thank God
[1:36:49] thank you Jesus
[1:36:51] quit letting that standard be dropped
[1:36:53] you can't be a standard Bearer and be
[1:36:55] afraid of Correction
[1:37:00] brother Brown says judgment begins at
[1:37:02] the house of God hears where we are
[1:37:05] judged and isn't it a pity that when we
[1:37:08] see that we're wrong and doing wrong
[1:37:10] thing living wrong kind of Life
[1:37:12] Associated wrong and everything that
[1:37:14] we're not big enough to walk up and say
[1:37:17] God I'm sorry I'm the one that's wrong
[1:37:21] you're right and I'm wrong and you
[1:37:24] forgive me and help me to do better next
[1:37:26] time if we just be real about ourselves
[1:37:29] but we don't
[1:37:32] no I'll tell you what we do is we
[1:37:33] decided Well there's a church within
[1:37:36] driving distance I get my feelings hurt
[1:37:37] here I'm gonna go over there
[1:37:39] and then I get my feelings hurt there
[1:37:41] and it's been long it's been about a
[1:37:42] year since I got my feelings heard over
[1:37:44] there so I'm coming back where I used to
[1:37:45] be and we turn into a bunch of church
[1:37:47] hoppers
[1:37:49] I don't know why we're here but here we
[1:37:50] are
[1:37:52] and then we never learned to deal with
[1:37:54] adversity we never learned to deal with
[1:37:55] correction we never sit in a place long
[1:37:57] enough to change and everybody's against
[1:37:59] us and everybody's hurting our feelings
[1:38:01] and we run here and run there listen to
[1:38:03] me the standard is that the house of God
[1:38:05] is the beginning of instruction it is
[1:38:07] the place of Correction when he comes I
[1:38:09] say Lord if you got to step on my toes
[1:38:12] step on them if you got to hurt my
[1:38:13] feelings hurt my feelings judge me here
[1:38:15] lord judge me now but whatever it takes
[1:38:18] I just want to be ready I just want to
[1:38:20] be corrected I don't want to stand
[1:38:22] before judgment there Lord if you got to
[1:38:24] preach a whole sermon on me if you got
[1:38:26] to call my name if you gotta offend me
[1:38:29] whatever you got to do Lord I just want
[1:38:31] to be ready
[1:38:33] get our attitude where we come and we
[1:38:35] don't always got to be preached happy
[1:38:37] we don't always got to be able to hear
[1:38:39] things that make us excited sometimes we
[1:38:40] hear things that hurt
[1:38:44] sometimes there's things in our lives
[1:38:46] that ain't even sinful but they need to
[1:38:47] be hit so you'll bring them back in
[1:38:49] balance
[1:38:55] it's hard sometimes
[1:38:58] but whatever Lord I want to receive my
[1:39:00] judgment here
[1:39:04] being a standard barrier on people comes
[1:39:06] with great responsibility
[1:39:08] it also comes with great Danger
[1:39:12] because the standard Bearer in a battle
[1:39:14] the one who carries the flag
[1:39:17] that was sometimes caught carrying the
[1:39:19] colors
[1:39:20] they're the ones that lead the charge
[1:39:23] they have the colors of the flag and in
[1:39:25] an ancient times it was called the
[1:39:27] standard or the banner and
[1:39:29] and it shows the other soldiers Where We
[1:39:32] Are
[1:39:34] it shows the other soldiers what ground
[1:39:36] we have taken
[1:39:38] it shows the other soldiers where we're
[1:39:40] standing at where we are fighting at
[1:39:42] some may have got hurt
[1:39:43] some may have got wounded
[1:39:46] some may have got disillusioned in the
[1:39:48] battle
[1:39:49] they're still our brothers
[1:39:51] and they have to be able to look around
[1:39:53] through the smoke and the fog and the
[1:39:55] hurt and the wounds and they gotta be
[1:39:57] able to find where's the standard
[1:40:00] where's the banner
[1:40:02] where's the battle raging
[1:40:06] and I began to look for the flag of
[1:40:07] their unit
[1:40:09] says if in the course of a fight you
[1:40:11] were separated from your unit one looked
[1:40:13] around until you saw the standard and
[1:40:16] then you tried to get back as close to
[1:40:18] it as possible
[1:40:19] the standard bear hint of battle is in
[1:40:22] the center of the front lines so the
[1:40:25] following troops know where to go
[1:40:27] but it also shows the enemy
[1:40:30] where to shoot
[1:40:33] every gun in hell is trained on you
[1:40:37] but the Lord said I've Got Confidence
[1:40:40] every gun in hell is trained in you
[1:40:43] listen this isn't for the faint-hearted
[1:40:45] young people
[1:40:46] this ain't for those that are going to
[1:40:48] turn and run when the bullets start
[1:40:49] flying
[1:40:50] this ain't for the weak
[1:40:54] that's why I called you
[1:40:56] that's what I'm trying to get you to
[1:40:58] understand is that you're more
[1:40:59] courageous than you will ever realize
[1:41:01] you know most people will never realize
[1:41:03] how courageous they are until they have
[1:41:05] to be
[1:41:08] and I'm telling you we're at the point
[1:41:10] where there's no turning back there's no
[1:41:11] running you have to be
[1:41:13] it is time that you have to stand that's
[1:41:15] why he called you when the bullets start
[1:41:17] flying days of Miracles has passed
[1:41:23] you don't have to get the Holy Ghost
[1:41:24] like that anymore
[1:41:27] who are you going to turn and run it
[1:41:29] don't matter what kind of clothes we
[1:41:30] wear
[1:41:32] sure don't matter what stuff you're
[1:41:34] watching and feeding on it don't matter
[1:41:36] what kind of Clips you're sending to
[1:41:37] your friends
[1:41:40] we don't need all that emotion in the
[1:41:41] house of God anymore
[1:41:44] we don't need all that worshiping and
[1:41:46] dancing and all that fanaticism somebody
[1:41:48] says I ain't moving I ain't backing up
[1:41:51] off what God has given me as a matter of
[1:41:52] fact I'm going to take more matter of
[1:41:54] fact I'm gonna take another step I know
[1:41:56] I can have it just like that I know it
[1:41:58] matters it's in the word I know I can
[1:42:00] have an upper room experience I know I
[1:42:02] can have that backside of the dancer
[1:42:04] burning bush experience just like Moses
[1:42:06] had I know I can have those things I
[1:42:08] know I can have freedom to worship I'm
[1:42:10] not backing up off of what God has given
[1:42:14] me if it cost me friends if it cost me
[1:42:16] popularity I don't care it matters and
[1:42:20] I'm called to raise the standard and say
[1:42:22] I'll stand right here no matter what
[1:42:27] I'm going to raise the standard of the
[1:42:28] whole gospel
[1:42:30] I'm going to display the truth of the
[1:42:32] whole gospel
[1:42:33] and as ministers we need to preach the
[1:42:35] whole gospel
[1:42:39] because the message preached exactly the
[1:42:41] way it was delivered
[1:42:43] will produce exactly what it promised to
[1:42:46] produce
[1:42:48] think about it so many times we water it
[1:42:50] down leave off parts and then act like
[1:42:52] it's the fault of the message that
[1:42:53] things didn't come out the way it said
[1:42:54] it would
[1:42:56] you got to preach it the whole way
[1:42:59] brother Bram says I believe there's got
[1:43:01] to be some kind of a standard that God
[1:43:02] will judge the church by or the world
[1:43:04] there's got to be some standard it
[1:43:06] cannot be the church organization
[1:43:08] because they differ
[1:43:10] Who would know what to do but there is a
[1:43:12] standard and that's his word I believe
[1:43:14] that God watches over his word I believe
[1:43:16] that the word is punctuated exactly the
[1:43:18] way God wants it the Bible it's God's
[1:43:21] word to the people there's where reason
[1:43:23] I believe in that word
[1:43:25] and I believe the word is a seed and if
[1:43:28] that seed is sowed in the right ground
[1:43:29] and watered by the Holy Spirit it'll
[1:43:32] bring forth of its kind any promise that
[1:43:34] God made God will do it
[1:43:40] but not if we're only standing on half
[1:43:42] of it
[1:43:44] he's going to bring forth what it is
[1:43:45] you're willing to stand for
[1:43:47] and I want to encourage you once again
[1:43:49] that we have to stand for the whole
[1:43:51] thing
[1:43:52] the entire thing back to our opening
[1:43:54] scripture Psalm 16 4 thou has given a
[1:43:57] banner to them that fear thee that it
[1:44:00] may be displayed
[1:44:02] because of the truth sayla
[1:44:06] it's got to be displayed
[1:44:08] so that you can rally to the colors
[1:44:11] rally to the truth when you've been
[1:44:13] wounded rally to the standard when you
[1:44:15] get separated what is the standard
[1:44:17] brother Aaron the standard is this word
[1:44:20] and the word preached in its entirety
[1:44:22] will produce what it said it will
[1:44:24] produce there will be Acts 2 experiences
[1:44:28] come on now there will be dancing and
[1:44:30] shouting in the house of God there will
[1:44:32] be the gift that manifest there will be
[1:44:35] healings in the house of God and let's
[1:44:37] bring it on down there will be
[1:44:39] overcoming lives to go along with that
[1:44:42] matter of fact that's the most important
[1:44:44] thing there will be those things if we
[1:44:47] preach it if we hold it if we stand on
[1:44:49] it there will be Overcomers in this day
[1:44:51] saying it works the anchor holds the
[1:44:54] token works but you gotta stand and say
[1:44:57] it's the truth and stand on that in this
[1:45:00] day quit changing the standards
[1:45:04] well maybe we can let our young people
[1:45:06] do a little bit of this
[1:45:08] maybe a little bit of that maybe we
[1:45:10] shouldn't be so hard
[1:45:13] I don't know I'll let you tell me but I
[1:45:15] believe I'm looking at a group of young
[1:45:17] people that like it preach just the way
[1:45:19] it is they want the truth give to them
[1:45:21] because they say I want to leave this
[1:45:22] world I don't want to be crushed under
[1:45:24] the rubble I want to take a Rapture
[1:45:26] preach it to us truth preach it to us
[1:45:28] straight tell us all of it don't leave
[1:45:30] off even a little bit Hallelujah I'm
[1:45:33] thankful to be associated with people
[1:45:35] that like it that way
[1:45:41] there was a standard Bearer
[1:45:43] in the Civil War
[1:45:45] in the time of battle when his company
[1:45:47] was charging up a hill
[1:45:49] against an enemy position and he was
[1:45:51] going ahead of the troops
[1:45:53] charging up this hill that was going to
[1:45:54] be difficult to take
[1:45:56] listen young people
[1:45:58] in this last day these last strongholds
[1:46:00] they're going to be difficult to take
[1:46:02] we're gonna face some tough battles
[1:46:05] you might as well just buckle down and
[1:46:07] prepare
[1:46:09] and get ready to go into battle because
[1:46:10] it's coming if you ain't in it now it's
[1:46:12] coming
[1:46:14] and he's leading this charge up this
[1:46:16] hill
[1:46:16] towards a fortified position
[1:46:19] and he's carrying the flag
[1:46:21] and the enemy fire is strong and the
[1:46:23] company is basically being shot to
[1:46:25] pieces
[1:46:26] they're being Torn to Pieces but the
[1:46:28] standard bear is gaining ground
[1:46:30] he's getting closer and he's separating
[1:46:31] himself further and further and he's
[1:46:33] taken every little step and the officer
[1:46:35] in charge he deems the battle a lost
[1:46:38] cause
[1:46:39] and he decides that the this battle is
[1:46:41] too difficult and he wants to call his
[1:46:43] men back
[1:46:44] there's too many of them officers in the
[1:46:46] pulpit
[1:46:48] he says this was a little bit too hard
[1:46:49] maybe we need to back off this battle
[1:46:52] so he calls the standard Bearer and he
[1:46:54] orders him to bring back the flag
[1:46:57] he says come back
[1:46:59] the standard Bearer turns and looks at
[1:47:01] him he says I will not give up ground
[1:47:03] that I have gained I will not return the
[1:47:06] standard how about you and the men come
[1:47:08] up I say we're not giving up any ground
[1:47:11] tonight how about you bring the men up
[1:47:13] how about you bring the men up to the
[1:47:14] standard of the word we don't got to
[1:47:16] drop the standards to make people feel
[1:47:18] better we don't got to give up what's
[1:47:20] been given to us I say bring up the men
[1:47:22] bring up the truth we can take the
[1:47:24] Fortress we can take the Rapture oh it's
[1:47:27] difficult the battle's hard but I'm not
[1:47:29] giving up ground I'm not going back
[1:47:31] where I came from I've come this far
[1:47:33] come on up come on up further take more
[1:47:38] ground tonight
[1:47:40] bring up the men
[1:47:42] rally to The Standard
[1:47:45] hallelujah what is the standard well
[1:47:48] just accept God sent a prophet
[1:47:52] I just make sure you're at church be a
[1:47:54] good boy be a good girl
[1:47:56] no the standard is you must be born
[1:47:58] again
[1:48:00] the standard is you must be born again
[1:48:03] you must have the Holy Ghost I'm talking
[1:48:05] about the real deal fire of God that
[1:48:07] fell on the day of Pentecost that fell
[1:48:10] in the upper room it will fall again it
[1:48:12] will fall for you it said the promise is
[1:48:14] unto them and as many as them that are
[1:48:16] far off hey it's been a long time since
[1:48:18] then but here we are far off and I'm
[1:48:20] saying Lord Fall Again fall in my life
[1:48:23] follow my children fall in my home I
[1:48:26] believe for that is the standard you
[1:48:29] must be born again
[1:48:33] we can't lower that standard just so we
[1:48:35] can say our little boy's doing good
[1:48:39] we must be born again
[1:48:41] and the results of that will be the same
[1:48:43] standard it will be a Victorious Life
[1:48:47] Hallelujah
[1:48:51] too much moving of the landmarks
[1:48:54] too much lowering of the standards
[1:48:57] instead of rising up to what the word
[1:48:58] declares
[1:49:00] brother Branham would say we got too
[1:49:02] many people preaching the gospel that
[1:49:03] ought to be cutting corn
[1:49:09] he said preaching a watered down head
[1:49:10] knowledge of a gospel
[1:49:13] he says what we need it's not juvenile
[1:49:15] delinquency it's parent delinquency it's
[1:49:18] because that the parents has neglected
[1:49:19] and then he takes it a step further and
[1:49:22] a whole lot of it is the way the church
[1:49:23] never preached it
[1:49:25] what's the matter Brethren get back to
[1:49:28] the gospel preach old time Holiness and
[1:49:32] get it into the church again we must
[1:49:34] have a standard
[1:49:38] young people
[1:49:40] calling on you to raise the standard
[1:49:43] I'm calling on you to raise listen there
[1:49:45] is a standard of modesty
[1:49:47] I say wave it proudly there is a
[1:49:50] standard of Bible Holiness I say wave it
[1:49:53] proudly we have standards of
[1:49:56] conversation that we are to have
[1:49:59] rise to that standards there are
[1:50:01] standards of conduct
[1:50:03] and I'll tell you one there is a
[1:50:05] standard of worship
[1:50:08] as a matter of fact the standard is that
[1:50:10] it is to be in spirit
[1:50:12] and in truth I say raise the standard
[1:50:16] for all of them to see they may not want
[1:50:18] to worship with you in spirit and truth
[1:50:20] but I say hey here's the standard here's
[1:50:22] how you do it here's how you praise the
[1:50:24] Lord when he begins to move through the
[1:50:26] house of God Hey listen y'all about to

[1:50:46] and said uh oh the Holy Roller showed up

[1:51:02] know how to raise the standard we've
[1:51:04] been set free we've been delivered we
[1:51:06] know what we've got to thank you for I'm
[1:51:08] not ashamed to praise him you ain't
[1:51:10] gonna shout us under a Pew we're going

[1:51:19] in there's a shout of the king and the
[1:51:21] camp we have a standard of worship

[1:51:36] there's a standard of worship
[1:51:38] we're not afraid to raise that standard
[1:51:40] High
[1:51:43] never take for granted the freedom you
[1:51:45] have to worship
[1:51:47] Freedom's just like territory that which
[1:51:49] is not defended is lost
[1:51:53] that which is not defended is lost I say
[1:51:56] worship with all you got
[1:51:58] you worship with everything that's
[1:52:00] within you listen others may not
[1:52:02] understand
[1:52:03] Others May sit there quiet and as the
[1:52:05] master passes by
[1:52:07] it may not make much sense to them if I
[1:52:10] say raise the standard for them to see
[1:52:12] raise the standard
[1:52:14] I say praise him till the walls fall
[1:52:16] down
[1:52:18] you know they tried to tell Bartimaeus
[1:52:20] to be quiet
[1:52:22] they would have rather him set in church
[1:52:23] and stay blind and quiet
[1:52:28] they may not understand why you shout
[1:52:30] they may not understand why you dance
[1:52:32] but they didn't also they also didn't go
[1:52:34] through the battles you went through
[1:52:36] they hadn't gone through the wars you've
[1:52:38] gone through maybe if they saw the tears
[1:52:40] on your pill at night maybe if they saw
[1:52:42] the chains of anxiety maybe if they saw
[1:52:44] the way you've been Afflicted they'd
[1:52:45] understand when you cried out thank you
[1:52:48] Jesus hallelujah praise the Lord I'm
[1:52:51] free I'm the leopard they may not
[1:52:53] understand but let them know I've got
[1:52:55] something to thank him for oh Hallelujah
[1:52:59] if you've been set free or something you
[1:53:01] got something to praise him for tonight
[1:53:03] you've been delivered you got a reason
[1:53:05] to praise him tonight there's nobody
[1:53:07] that can praise the Lord like a young
[1:53:09] person who's walked out of the jail cell
[1:53:12] who's been set free who's been loose who
[1:53:15] knows I was bound for hell but now I'm
[1:53:17] saved now I'm delivered now I've got the
[1:53:20] Holy Ghost that's nobody that can praise
[1:53:23] him like you can Praise Him raise the
[1:53:26] standard of Praise In The House of God
[1:53:28] hallelujah
[1:53:31] Hallelujah
[1:53:34] people want to sit back and criticize
[1:53:37] whoo
[1:53:39] get out of the seat of the scornful
[1:53:45] had a young person tell me one time
[1:53:47] and prayer said this is the only place I
[1:53:50] don't hurt
[1:53:53] you want to Rob them
[1:53:55] of their praise and their Worship in a
[1:53:58] world that's trying to consume them in a
[1:54:00] world that's trying to destroy them in a
[1:54:02] world full of pressure and they step
[1:54:04] into the presence of almighty God you
[1:54:06] won't just sit there and be quiet and
[1:54:08] put their worship back in a
[1:54:09] denominational box I say be free in the
[1:54:12] house of God you've got something to
[1:54:14] praise him about you got something to
[1:54:16] worship him about like no other people
[1:54:18] ever before you are the people about to
[1:54:20] step from time into eternity into a new
[1:54:23] body where no demon can ever torment you
[1:54:25] again no fear can ever attack you again
[1:54:28] you're right on the verge of it and this
[1:54:30] people knows how to raise a standard of
[1:54:33] Praise weighs a standard of worship
[1:54:35] Hallelujah
[1:54:37] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:54:40] Hallelujah
[1:54:42] oh my
[1:54:45] are we about to close
[1:54:48] we're about to bring this down because I
[1:54:49] do want to hit this point
[1:54:51] I don't believe in being hypocritical In
[1:54:53] Worship
[1:54:54] yeah
[1:54:56] if you've got things in your life need
[1:54:57] to be dealt with and the spirit of God
[1:54:59] needs to move you need to run to the
[1:55:00] altar not run the aisles
[1:55:03] I believe that
[1:55:06] I do believe we need to deal with sin
[1:55:11] but also believe that those that
[1:55:12] struggle the hardest
[1:55:14] and have the hardest battles
[1:55:16] in the hardest troubles
[1:55:18] they worship the freest when they get a
[1:55:20] taste of victory
[1:55:22] they let loose
[1:55:23] so you're sitting there well I know the
[1:55:25] struggle they've been in and look at
[1:55:26] that
[1:55:27] kind of attitude is that it ought to be
[1:55:30] when you see them get loose it ought to
[1:55:31] make you so happy that you get right
[1:55:33] there next to him and show them how it's
[1:55:34] done oh this Young Person's been
[1:55:36] fighting this Young Person's been
[1:55:37] battling they've been drugged through
[1:55:39] the mud the devil's attacked them the
[1:55:41] devil's brought all kind of Lies over
[1:55:42] them but now they're free now they're
[1:55:44] loose now they're in the presence of
[1:55:46] almighty God get right there with them
[1:55:48] and say fill them Lord make an eternal
[1:55:50] drop down in their hearts forever where
[1:55:53] they never have to go back because it's
[1:55:55] not just a temporary shout in a
[1:55:57] temporary praise but they can go into
[1:55:58] the holy of holies where it is forever
[1:56:01] and eternal

[1:59:05] what about when I get stronger stronger
[1:59:07] in the faith
[1:59:11] I'm a history guy
[1:59:13] so I've always loved this quote
[1:59:16] Patrick Henry
[1:59:19] I was listening
[1:59:22] the colonies seem to face an
[1:59:24] insurmountable odds as the greatest army
[1:59:26] on Earth
[1:59:27] was on the shores of America
[1:59:31] and there were so many people trying to
[1:59:32] talk to Patriots out of fighting
[1:59:35] you don't stand a chance
[1:59:38] but there was people called to the
[1:59:41] battle
[1:59:43] he says they tell us sir that we are
[1:59:45] weak
[1:59:47] unable to cope was so formidable and
[1:59:49] adversary
[1:59:50] but when shall we be stronger
[1:59:54] oh I love that will it be next week
[1:59:57] or next year
[1:59:59] will it be when we were totally disarmed
[2:00:02] and when a British guard shall be
[2:00:04] stationed in every house shall We Gather
[2:00:07] strength by inaction
[2:00:11] sir we are not weak if we make a proper
[2:00:14] use of those means which god of nature
[2:00:17] hath placed in our power
[2:00:19] besides sir we shall not fight our
