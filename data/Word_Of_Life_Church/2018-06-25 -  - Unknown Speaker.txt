TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I know you're familiar to a story but let's read it and thirst and Tucson like a little lady in our city where we come from a little girl went up there to church very little fine girl she was coming down the street she had long hair you know and had her pull back slick of like a peeled onion no makeup on this girl used to make fun of her that if you wouldn't have that flat headed preacher up there speaking of me you can look like something decent but you look like something out of an antique shop she did write to her over the coals every time she'd see her like that said I pass chourus broad mirrored I mean brown and that's why you look like that that don't mean anything how you dress or think it does God's Bible says it does we shall live every word so this little girl I like this little girl's attitude this little girl never paid a bit of attention to her went on she is a missionary now so then this young lady took a social disease and she died a friend of mine pump the embalming fluid in her when she was dying he told me after she was dead he kept smelling the fluid in at either hole in her side social disease even her parents didn't know what was wrong with her she died but before she died she taught Sunday school and all the little Sunday school group come in they wanted to see her when she went off to heaven the angels come and pack her away and remember she'd went to church she was a Sunday school teacher she'd done many many things and she got ready to go to heaven she got ready to meet God by what mirror by the mirror of that church and that preacher that preacher kept holding this miracle sister don't worry about cutting your hair God go man whatever so gone some old burns need a new coat of paint I agree Barnes lips bless you wanna be a Jezebel then push them on Jezebel good so he kept holding that male front so she's getting ready to go to heaven in front of that mirror so she looks in that mirror and she sees her Bob huh God don't care about that she sees her painted face that don't make no difference to God and she sees that all these things he should that don't make no difference a God running have a man commits adultery getting a social disease I don't make no devil God yes sir how could she do that it was the mirror she's getting ready my [Applause] lord have mercy children notice her pastor was outside smoking a cigarette walking up and down the hall in the hospital that was gonna sandwich just wanna die you know and they note she had to die the doctor said she was dying so there's gonna see the angels come and pack her away and all at once was she faced the reality now death is moving in the church mirror is now pulled away and the word bear is now in front of her her soul that should send away her conscience was now coming back she's fixing to face death and then she looks in the mirror and you imagine when she sees herself how she looks I'm gonna Christian I'm the saved cloth what told her when she saw her reflection in the mirror of the word not the mirror of the church now notices little Emma says she has a loyal church remember Sunday school teacher a loyal church member of a big fan denominational Church but once she started to struggle and death struck her eyes bounced out and she said unlost her ass bounced out what's she saying herself as she really is well it's amazing that she didn't see no mercy she didn't see no hanging on the cross offering her part the only thing in the last thing she saw was herself lost so she dies she dies gasping for grab breath looking at herself in the mirror of the word and what she sees is not a loving Savior not the angels of God but she sees herself in the mirror love I'm lost she said I'm lost go get the pastor he put his cigarette out and walked in and said we'll get the doctor to give you a hypo said I don't want no hypo you deceiver of a man now look the mirror is spreading out here this man that she thought Jesus was helping her meet the angels of God this man was preaching what she thought something that would make her in the presence of God and make acceptable and now the mirror broadens out and she sees herself and she looks at him and said you are a deceiver dear God dear God you deceiver of men I'm dying and I'm going to hell and I'm lost this is this because you failed to tell me the truth by God's help in mercy I never want one of you to honestly be able to point your finger in my face and say you did not tell me the truth and they make you mad I make Trump on your toes I'm gonna do whatever more but I do not want this to be said about me did we brother still we preach the brothers no we do not want this to be said about us so where a person would send us in your mansion now this preacher standing before God lost himself why because of a mirror and now you're the woman sees the mirror and she sees herself and she sees this preacher I'm lost because you failed to tell me the truth don't get that little good use girl and bring her here to me real quick she is right minute amazing she didn't ask for brother branham she asked for the message made flesh in a female for the Lord praise the Lord Sheila nestra brother Neville she mess along the Deacons of the Church of one of the other preachers of the church but why she or she wanted that light that light that had walked before her day in and day out and she tried to talk her out of it but she saw that little girl didn't pay a bit more attention to her than nothing why this little girl was get ready to meet God in front of a mirror of my house or she was rather than they gone and you couldn't talk her out of it Oh Happy Valley this is what I want you to be I don't want folks just calling on me for prayer I don't want them said all he's a good preacher I want them to see this message manifest here here on the pews go get that little good juice girl and bring her up here to me real quick she is right wait till you face that reality once don't you try to stop that holiness don't you blast it away with some modern education or double-barrel shotgun you listen to that warning of the holy ghost tonight that's warning you I'm the way the truth and the life no man comes to the Father but Namie here is the word oh so good can you imagine when the tribulation finally sets in when the rapture goes it will be weeks or possibly even months before the people begin to realize the church now there will be people around this message that will start to recognize it as soon as day one everybody comes home from work and Mama's not there or daddies know it there you imagine the shock for the message people as the rapture takes place and they begin to realize there are the only ones in the world that will know what's going on and they go to work and they go to call the police and the EMT people and all the emergency people my mama's gone the rapture Church but oh brother BAM said within so you imagine how they're gonna look but how many other days or weeks go by before people begin to realize something's happening here all kinds of stuff is breaking loose everywhere what in the world is going on brother Ram said they will say I've thought there supposed to be a rapture first and the voice have come back from heaven it's already happened and you didn't know it I wonder how they'll feel when they found in look into the mirror of this message they have made fun of and then they realize they're in the tribulation period can you imagine some of these former followers that one day when the rapture takes place in Los Angeles falls in and all these things that they're laughing at in making fun of today and they will see every prophecy letter by letter and word by word come to pass and then they realize oh god what have I going god what have I done and they look into the mirror and what do they look and they see behind and in the mirror the backdrop of the tribulation why because they listen to some website they listen to some preacher they're tried to lead them off forward instead of taking the Bible the scriptural message and the vindicated prophet of God and trying to get dressed by the word they listen to a date than a car on a barrel and strip the women off and take them back to Laodicea and they're trying to get ready to meet Jesus of that mirror oh my brother sister will never work we've got to have the light of this day in order to reflect our lineage remember the only illumination present-tense illumination as around the reveal word of this hour everything else is darkness Laodicea is got the mirror of the Bible but I can't see they're in darkness how many mirrors you got if you ain't got light you still can't see [Music]
