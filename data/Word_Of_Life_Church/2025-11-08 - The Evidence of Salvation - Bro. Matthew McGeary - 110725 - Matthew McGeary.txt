We just want to welcome [music] Matt with us tonight. Just invite him to come out and uh take his liberty and speak what's on his heart this evening. Let's just sing this little chorus as he comes. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. [singing and music] Open the eyes of my heart. I want to [music and singing] see you. I [singing] want to see you. [music] Open the eyes [singing] of my heart, Lord.

[music] Hallelujah. Amen. And is that your heart's desire that you would just see the Lord this weekend? [music] And maybe you've come with a need or an expectation or maybe you don't have an expectation at all. Well, that happens. I mean, I I've come to church many times. You've been busy and you're running and you're going and you come to church and they sing the songs and before you know it, you just the word's coming forth. But maybe as we start &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh before the minister in the word, maybe we'll just allow a an opportunity to start forming an expectation [music] in your heart and maybe a need that you have in your life for yourself or for a family member, a brother, sister, maybe somebody in the church. I believe God can meet that need and I believe the Holy Spirit can just come in a supernatural way [music] and that the word can come forth and faith can rise up and bring forth the manifestation of the promise. Maybe as we just have the musicians, why don't we just go before the Lord in prayer? Lord Jesus, Lord, we're thankful that we could be here this evening. Lord, it's all that it's all by your grace and your mercy that Lord, you've called us and you've elected us. Lord, you've called us out from the things of the world and to this great glorious truth that we've received in this [music] last day. Lord, we just pray that this meeting here tonight, Lord, you'd just come. [music] And Lord, we have some scriptures and some quotes that are put down. But Lord, if you don't come by, then what would be the benefit? So Lord, I [music] just ask that you would come and you'd break the bread of life. And Lord, you distribute it to the needs that are represented here. And Lord, may in our heart we just start to form an expectation. Lord, may Lord, may there be ones that are in bondage set [music] free. And Lord, may where ones that need the revelation, Lord, may revelation break forth. And those that need to be born again and filled with the Holy Spirit. Oh God, may your mercy and your grace just go to each one, Lord, as only you can. Lord, we just surrender ourselves to you that you could just come just have your perfect will and way in the service now. In your name, the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll be reading out of numbers. I just want to thank brother Donnie and brother Joe for the invitation to be able to come and to be in fellowship with you. It's uh certainly a great privilege and opportunity. We don't take it take it lightly. My name's Brother Matthew McGary and I'm from Bedford, Texas. My dad, brother David McGary, is the pastor there at Christian Life Tabernacle. So, we bring your greetings and we're just excited for what the Lord would have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't be afraid to talk back. I'm going to be preaching at you. So, don't don't be afraid to let me know that you're here. But, um, we just have maybe a little something on our heart. Don't know what the direction we might go, but just want it to be a benefit to you. Is everybody feeling good this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure some of you have tired. Maybe you you drove a little bit away, maybe not, but we'll just move right into the word just to appreciate this. Numbers chapter 13 and verse 23- 27 says, "And they came under the brook of Eshkll and cut down from then a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff, and they brought up the pomegranates and the figs, the and the place was called the brook of Eshkll, because of the clusters of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thins. And they returned from searching of the land for 40 days. And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Piran and Kadesh, and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. And they told them And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whether thou sentest us, and surely it flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it. And also if you just turn in your Bibles to Galatians chapter 3 just reading here out of Galatians chapter 3 and verse 29 it says and if you be Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise. Amen. You may be seated. If you be Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise. And I was just listening to a sermon Brother Brandon preached. It's called the conflict between God and Satan. And he says, "And the other night I was preaching. I believe it was the tabernacle. And I struck something that's done me more good than anything I've thought of since I've been converted." And I might repeat it again if it's all right. I know where you know where I'm going to. But it was that evidence of salvation. And I thought, my if here's the prophet preaching in 1962 and he says he struck a thought uh that that did him done him more good than than his conversion. I thought my I want to know a little bit about that, too. I'd like to look into this and see maybe maybe what he was talking about. And he starts to to to to show this how it was on the evidence of salvation. You know, as I thought about that, I I just thought I would ask, you know, what does salvation mean to you? &gt;&gt; You know, what is even the word salvation when when it when it's said, what does it mean to you? You know, h have you experienced it? you know, and and that's just kind of the way life is, you know, is is maybe uh there might be certain places if you drive around town and you go to certain places and and they might not mean anything to you, but somebody else they might have had an experience there or maybe uh they were proposed to or or something would have happened and maybe there's certain church grounds or certain camps and where you where you met the Lord and and or maybe there's a certain place that becomes really special to you because it has meaning and it it has it has some value to you and So when you when you hear it, you know, you maybe you perk up or you you know, you recognize it like, "Oh, I know a little bit about that." You know, that's how it is with certain hobbies and things, you know, uh you can start talking about hunting and and and you know, there's some people who go hunting and there's some people who are hunters and and you can just get to talking a little bit and somebody can say, "Well, I I bought a gun and I go out in the woods and and that's about as far as they can talk about hunting." And then you talk to some other people who my they can just start talking in such a way that it's Greek to you, you know, like I don't even know what you're talking about. I I just I I get a gun and I go out and make a loud noise and and I never shoot anything. Well, maybe that's cuz you're not a hunter. But, you know, that's just the way it is. You could even think about maybe dates and I I was thinking about that, you know, is, you know, October 20th. I mean, does [clears throat] does that mean anything to anybody? October 20th, you know, does somebody in here? Maybe maybe 200 October 20th, 2007. YOU CAN START TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN DATES AND AND THAT MIGHT mean something to you cuz maybe it's your birthday or maybe somebody was born on that day and and and so your ears will perk up and and and you you know it might it might cause an expression and you know I was thinking about that and the other day I was on the phone and I I I was talking and I said I'll be there in six seven minutes and and all a sudden my kids you know they just I'm like what what did I say? What did I say? And it's it's just amazing now that there's some you can just say a couple NUMBERS AND PEOPLE LIKE WOW WOW YOU KNOW my because because it's some type of thing that that people are their ears are perked up to and and and it causes some type of REACTION AND AND I wonder though when WE WAS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SALVATION &gt;&gt; WOULD would you perk UP? WOULD IF SOMEBODY SAID SALVATION or the message of the HOUR WOULD WOULD ALL A SUDDEN YOU SAY HEY WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? I WANT TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. But but but but MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE WE DON'T HAVE THE VALUE THAT it should have and and maybe it doesn't have the meaning that it should have. And and HERE THE PROPHET IS TALKING ABOUT THE EVIDENCE OF SALVATION. And and I say it ought to mean something to you. I I I say, "What about the grace and the mercy of God?" AND WHAT ABOUT SALVATION? &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "I I THINK THAT SALVATION is the greatest miracle." G. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'd want to by the help of God just talk to you a little bit this evening is the evidence of salvation. &gt;&gt; He goes on in this message. He says, "It struck me and I and I and I I said I went home and I got in my room and I I I walked up and down the floor and I I just had a little good old time by myself, you know, just in there thinking about it." You know, we could preach a little bit right there for a little bit. Has has the preacher ever been preaching or have you ever been read reading your Bible or have you ever been listening to the message and the word struck you in such a way that you got excited about it? &gt;&gt; Now look, I'm not here to condemn. I I'm here to encourage you. If that has not happened in your life, I just want to say you're missing out. You you can read about who won the World Series and who won the Super Bowl and you can read the news and you can study this career and you can study that and I tell YOU ALL THOSE THINGS are going to burn. They're they're they're going to just be BURNING ATOMIC FIRE. BUT I want to tell you there's one thing that won't pass away and that is the WORD OF GOD. AND I WANT TO SAY IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORTH GETTING EXCITED ABOUT, I WANT TO SAY IT'S about the grace OF GOD. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORTH TALKING ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT SALVATION. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORTH TALKING ABOUT, IT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AND I SAY, "OH, GOD, HELP ME THAT SOMETHING IN THE WORD OF GOD WOULD STRIKE MY HEART IN SUCH A WAY THAT I COULD GO HOME AND I WOULD PACE BACK UP INTO THE FLOOR SAY,"LORD, I WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. I HEARD MY PASTOR PREACHING ON THE SUBJECT AND AND MAYBE I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT ALL, LORD, BUT SOMETHING IN MY SOUL WANTS TO KNOW MORE. I WANT TO HAVE SOME MORE REVELATION, LORD. I I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR GRACE AND YOUR MERCY, LORD. I I WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR WORD MORE." I SAY SOMETHING OUGHT TO STIR OUR HEARTS. SOMETHING OUGHT TO MAKE US SAY, "I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT." BUT IT'S SO EASY TO GET STIRRED UP WITH THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; So easy to get STIRRED UP WITH OUR JOBS AND WHAT FRIENDS THINK AND WHAT PEOPLE SAY. &gt;&gt; But just to think here he is. He's he HE'S WALKING UP AND PACING BACK AND FORTH on the floor and and here's what it was. I MIGHT PASS THIS ON to you for just a minute. I was talking about we are possessors of all things. Everything is ours. &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah. Glory to God. That ought to be enough right there to make somebody shout to think that if we are heirs of Christ, then we are heirs to all things. LOOK, YOU YOU YOU MIGHT NOT EVER BE ABLE TO GO TO ITALY ON THIS SIDE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO EVER GO OVER HERE, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU OWN IT. IT'S YOURS. YOU MIGHT DRIVE DOWN. I TELL YOU WHAT, THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TO TO JOHNSON CITY. THIS is a pretty place, brother Don. I TELL YOU WHAT, I GOT HERE AND I WAS FLYING IN. I WAS LOOKING AT THE HILLS and the trees and everything. I WAS LIKE, "MY MY, THEY DONE FIGURED IT OUT. THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE. JUST JUST BEAUTIFUL. AND YOU MIGHT DRIVE AROUND. YOU MIGHT SEE BIG HOMES UP ON THE HILLS. I WAS I WAS COMING FROM THE AIRPORT AND THERE'S SOME BIG OLD HOUSE UP ON THE HILL AND IT WAS ALL MOWED AND ALL THE TREES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THE COWS WERE EVERYTHING. MAN, MY THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE. WOULDN'T IT BE SOMETHING TO LIVE UP THERE? BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S MINE. &gt;&gt; I own it. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, BROTHER? BECAUSE I'M HEIR TO EVERYTHING. YOU SEE, SO MANY TIMES WE WE JUST GET SO CAUGHT UP WITH THE NATURAL THINGS AND THE RAT run uh the RAT RACE OF SOCIETY. WE GET SO BOGGED DOWN AND WE FORGET THE BENEFITS AND THE BLESSINGS THAT WERE BENEFICIARIES OF HIS RESURRECTION. [applause] &gt;&gt; WE POSSESS ALL THINGS. AND THE PROPHET WOULD GO ON AND SAY THAT'S WHY THEY CALL US CRAZY, you know, and and and because we we act funny. WHY? BECAUSE WE POSSESS ALL THINGS. WE POSSESS love and joy and peace. I DON'T KNOW. DOES ANYBODY NEED SOME JOY TONIGHT? DOES ANYBODY NEED SOME PEACE? WELL, YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO WALMART and and go out to the clerk THERE AND SAY, "HEY, I I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU. I I JUST COME DOWN HERE. I'VE GONE UP ALL AND DOWN THE AISLES AND I WAS TRYING TO FIND ME SOME JOY." They would, "Excuse me, what are YOU WHAT ARE YOU TALKING? I NEED SOME JOY." YOU KNOW, LIKE THE JOY OF YOUR SALVATION. THEY WOULD LOOK AT YOU FUNNY. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, ACTUALLY, I'M HERE TO BUY SOME LOVE OR I'M HERE TO BUY SOME PEACE." YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO THE GROCERY STORE. YOU CAN'T GO TO THE PHARMACY AND YOU CAN'T BUY TELL YOU WHAT, THE DEVIL GOTS A LOT OF SUBSTITUTES. And I want TO TELL YOU, IF YOU GOT INTO SOME TYPE OF ADDICTION AND YOU GOT SOME TYPE OF MEDICINE THE DOCTORS PRESCRIBED TO YOU, WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. BUT I WOULD TELL YOU, WHY DON'T YOU PRAY FOR A REVELATION? AND I TELL YOU, THE WORD CAN COME IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU CAN THROW THAT MEDICINE AWAY AND SAY, "I AIN'T GOT TO GO DOWN TO THE PHARMACY ANYMORE FOR MY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, FOR MY DEPRESSION, WHATEVER IT IS." WHY? BECAUSE I'M HEIR TO ALL THINGS. I own joy. I own peace. I OWN LONGSUFFERING. I'M A CHILD OF THE KING. AND IT'S ALL MINE. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; SEE, all of those things ARE ALL ALREADY OURS. YOU YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO THE STORE and buy it, but God gives us that. &gt;&gt; We possess it. That's our possession. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. And and we're JUST FOLLOWING A LITTLE THOUGHT HERE. OUR BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE'S IN THIS MESSAGE, THE CONFLICT between God and Satan. And and I believe he's referencing uh what he preaches earlier that month at the tabernacle uh possessing all things. And he says, "YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT OUR INHERITANCE." And and he got to thinking about Israel and how they were in bondage. And here Israel's in bondage for 400 years. And and and my I can't you can't even imagine uh those task masters and and how they beat them. And and my they they they maybe killed you if you if you weren't working the way they wanted and they kill your children or take your daughters. And here they're THEY'VE BEEN IN BONDAGE FOR 400 YEARS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HERE COMES A PROPHET COMING OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND HE'S TELLING THEM, "HEY, HEY, HEY, I GOD GIVE A PROMISE AND WE'RE GOING TO A PROMISED LAND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN BONDAGE ANYMORE." &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. HERE HE COME OUT OF THERE AND HE'S TELLING THEM, "LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE MUD PITS ANYMORE AND AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THESE TAX MASTERS ANYMORE CUZ THE TIME HAS COME THAT THAT GOD IS GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS BONDAGE." WELL, I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN FIND THAT AND LOOK INTO THE BIBLE. BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED TO UPDATE THE BIBLE EXPERIENCES INTO OUR OWN LIFE AND START TO LOOK, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'VE HAD A TASKMASTER. MAYBE SOMETHING'S BEEN RULING AND REIGNING OVER MY LIFE AND AND MAYBE I'VE BEEN DOING THINGS THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO AND AND I COME TO CHURCH AND I GO TO CAMP AND I HAVE AN EXPERIENCE AND THEN I GO BACK AWAY AND I FALL TO THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER AND OVER. WELL, I WANT TO TELL YOU, SOMETIMES WE MAKE MISTAKES AND SOMETIMES WE FALL. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, IF YOU'RE IN BONDAGE TO THAT THING AND IT'S RULING AND REIGNING IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER YOUR BODY AND OVER YOUR VESSEL, LOOK, WE ARE TO POSSESS OUR VESSELS AND SANCTIFICATION AND HONOR. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN DO THAT, AND THAT'S BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND IF YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN BONDAGE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW TO THAT LUST DEVIL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW TO THOSE SPIRITS. YOU CAN BE SET FREE AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND SHOUT THE VICTORY. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; OH, AND HERE'S THE MESSAGE COMING FORTH. LOOK, YOU DON'T YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE THAT WAY ANYMORE. The prophet of God would say this. He says uh but now they they they're told they're COMING OUT OF THIS BONDAGE AND AND AND THEY'RE GOING UH THEY'RE going to a land that flowth with milk and honey, and they can have their own farm. they they can raise their OWN STUFF AND AND feed their own children and send them to school and live in peace and and this GREAT LAND THAT BELONGS TO THEM, YOU KNOW, TO TO THEM. WHAT WHAT A GREAT PROMISE. THINK OF WHAT THAT MEANT. &gt;&gt; WELL, once again, why don't we bring it up to our day? &gt;&gt; God's Hey, God's given us great and precious promises &gt;&gt; that by these we might be partakers of divine nature. A and if we're not careful, WE SELL OURSELVES SHORT OF WHAT CHRIST DIED FOR. THAT THE VERY LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST COULD COME BACK AND IN TABERNACLE YOUR BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LOOK, I I have it right here. I I I GUESS THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT OUT. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "AND AS THE FATHER HAS SENT ME, SO SEND YOU." JESUS SEE. NOW WATCH. THE FATHER THAT SENT HIM went in him to vindicate himself. Right? For he was THE WORD. AND THE SAME JESUS THAT SENT YOU GOES WITH you and in you TO VINDICATE THE SAME GOD. AS THE FATHER HAS SENT ME, I live by the father, so I send you AND YOU LIVE BY ME. WHAT IS HE? HE IS THE WORD AND YOU LIVE BY THE WORD. LOOK, THE THE GOD DID NOT SEND A MESSAGE BY A VINDICATED PROPHET. SO IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD NEVER OBTAIN AND IT'S JUST SOME MESSAGE AND SOME GREAT PROPHET AND HE DID THE GREATER WORKS AND YOU CAN NEVER SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN AND YOU CAN NEVER GET THE TOTAL VICTORY AND YOU CAN NEVER COME TO THESE PLACES AND YOU'RE ALWAYS JUST TRYING AND YOU'RE ALWAYS FALLING SHORT AND AND YOU'RE ALWAYS JUST HOPING AND AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT EVERYBODY ELSE AND WHY ARE THEY SO GOOD AND WHY ARE THEY SUCH A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND WHY I'M ALWAYS HAVING PROBLEMS. LOOK, THIS MESSAGE CAME TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE HEIR TO EVERYTHING. AND JUST AS THE PROPHET OF GOD WAS ABLE TO LIVE A OVERCOMING, VICTORIOUS LIFE. LOOK, I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE TO MATURITY, SHOWING US THIS MESSAGE WORKS. &gt;&gt; HEY, THIS MESSAGE WORKS. I TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU EVER COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND YOU CONFESS YOUR SINS AND SAY, "LORD, I AM SORRY. PLEASE FORGIVE ME." I TELL YOU, THERE'S A GUSHER FROM HEAVEN THAT'LL COME DOWN. IT'LL CHANGE THE WAY YOU ACT. IT'LL CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR NATURE. IT WILL FILL YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND THEREFORE, IT'S NO MORE I THAT LIVETH. IT IS CHRIST THAT LIVETH IN ME. AND THE VERY CHRIST ANOINTING IN MY LIFE IS FULFILLING THE VERY SPOKEN WORD OF THE HOUR. IT AIN'T SOMETHING THAT A MAN CAN DO. IT AIN'T SOMETHING THAT I CAN THINK OF OR SOMETHING THAT I CAN MUSTER. LOOK, IT GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU SURRENDER TO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Today is the day of salvation. &gt;&gt; What about it, young people? Hey, tonight's a new night. &gt;&gt; YESTERDAY'S GONE AND THE OTHER CAMPS, THEY'RE ALL GONE. BUT TONIGHT'S A NEW NIGHT. &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE SALVATION of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I say like THEM LEPERS SAY, "WHY SIT YE HERE UNTIL YOU DIE?" &gt;&gt; You got a need. You got something YOU HAVE NEED OF. LOOK, UH UH GET GET RID OF YOUR PRIDE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBOR. THERE IS SOMETHING here for you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S MORE HOLY GHOST. THERE'S MORE LIBERTY. THERE'S MORE FREEDOM. THERE'S MORE REVELATION. &gt;&gt; WELL, all right. &gt;&gt; So, we're just in THIS STORY HERE HOW HE BRINGS THEM THIS GREAT PROMISE and what that must have meant to them. And then we KNOW HOW GOD BROUGHT THEM OUT BY A MIGHTY HAND WITH ALL THE PLAGUES and and THEN THEY WERE BACKED UP THERE AT AT THE RED SEA AND and my we just we just moved through so MANY THINGS THAT YOU COULD TAP INTO THERE. BUT GOD BRINGS THEM OUT AND I WANT TO GET DOWN TO WHERE OUR TEXT WAS AND WHERE WHERE NOW BROTHER BRANDHAM'S referring to Joshua AND CALEB AND THE SPIES GOING OVER. HE SAYS, "AND JOSHUA WENT OVER INTO THE promised land." Now remember, none of them had ever been there. They didn't know whether the land was actually there or not. They just by faith went by what was told them that God had a place for them and they was going to that place just by faith. Now think of that. left Egypt and God brought them out and now they're nearing that land. And when they get near the land, Joshua goes over into the land and brings back the evidence. &gt;&gt; CROSSES JORDAN, GOES OVER INTO PALESTINE, BRINGS BACK THE EVIDENCE. A GREAT BUNCH OF GRAPES THAT TAKEN TWO MEN TO PACK AND THEY could eat those grapes. And he said, "THE LAND IS JUST EXACTLY what God said it was." &gt;&gt; SO HERE'S JOSHUA AND CALEB. THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH THE FRUIT. THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH THE EVIDENCE. THEY ACTUALLY have proof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're like, "Well, brother, yeah. What so what do you what does that even mean, brother Matthew?" You know, I was kind of thinking about that. You know, sometimes I'll take my kids to an ice cream shop. You know, you go in there and they got all the flavors and everything like that. Little Evan, you know, six years old, he I want that one. Okay. You want the mocha frappuccino chocolate chip chunk special? Yeah, I want that one. Like, all right. Can Can we get a sample of that? And we get a little sample, right? And I give it to him. And he puts that and he tastes he goes, "Yeah, I want that one." I say, "Okay, son. You can have that one." You know what? what he starts doing. He starts jumping. HE STARTS GETTING EXCITED. HE STARTS TELLING HIS SISTERS. &gt;&gt; He He ain't worried about how much it cost. &gt;&gt; He He ain't worried of how long it took to make it. &gt;&gt; He He HE HE DON'T CARE BECAUSE HIS DADDY, his father said, "Son, you can have it." &gt;&gt; AND NOW ALL HE'S ACTUALLY DONE IS HE'S JUST TASTED A LITTLE SPOONFUL. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE STARTS DOING? JUST HEAD. I I'M GOING TO GET ME SOME ICE CREAM. MY THAT WAS REALLY GOOD. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY DOES HE GET SO EXCITED? CUZ HE KNOWS THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; WELL, COME ON, CHILDREN OF GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF EXPERIENCE. I don't know WHAT KIND OF BLESSING, BUT I KNOW THAT JESUS CHRIST IS HERE AND YOU CAN HAVE AN EXPERIENCE. AND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S JUST A LITTLE TASTE. IT'S JUST A LITTLE DOWN PAYMENT. COME ON. AND IF HEY, IF IF WE CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT ICE CREAM, HOW MUCH MORE CAN WE GET EXCITED ABOUT THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD? IF YOU'VE EVER COME INTO HIS PRESENCE, IF YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED THE GRACE OF GOD COMING INTO THE CHURCH AND WALKING UP AND DOWN THE AISLES AND IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED HIS BLESSING, OH, THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT RAISES UP ON THE ON THE INSIDE OF YOU SAYS, "HEY, THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM." I SERVE A A GOD THAT OWNS A CATTLE ON A THOUSAND EELS AND I'VE JUST GOT A LITTLE BITTY TASTE, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. OH, &gt;&gt; he he got the evidence. &gt;&gt; You know, he when he tasted that, it was evidence. SEE, YOU YOU CAN TRY to look at something and just just think, well, yeah, it it looks good. But my Bible says, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good." &gt;&gt; You know, so when you when you look at those things and and here in our text is where we're at. He says, "AND WE CAME UNDER THE LAND WHETHER WHETHER thou sentest us, and surely it flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it." You know, I don't know about you, but I remember maybe as a kid thinking about that. I'm like, a land flowing with milk and honey? Like, does it have like rivers of milk &gt;&gt; and are like the trees dripping like with honey? You know, and I I'm like, what what does that even mean? And and I was thinking about that and I thought, you know what? Because when you hear something in the word of God or you hear something in that, what do you start to do? You try to make a mental image or you try to interpret the word &gt;&gt; a land that maybe there's a lot of cows and bees &gt;&gt; because you're trying to understand or interpret, you know, you start to THINK ABOUT AND I AND I I I GOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT. AND I said, "You know, there's this thing called now chat, GPT, whatever." &gt;&gt; And and I and I put in the description, and sure enough, it painted a beautiful picture with some big old mountains. And here come right out of one mountain, a big river of milk. And here come out of the other mountain, a big river of honey. Because what was it? It was it was an intellectual conception of what the word promise meant. And I want to tell you, IF WE ARE NOT CAREFUL, we start to accept an explanation. We start to expect accept an idea or we read something there and there and if we're not careful, we accept some definition as the revelation and we never actually experience the true promise or the benefit of it. &gt;&gt; Look, we live in an age where everything can be altered and everything can be edited and and I mean now they making things, you know, pictures you don't even know if it's real or not. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Look at this, man. Isn't this No, no, no. That's AI." &gt;&gt; You know, I I was I was up in Montana and and uh you know, we were just blessed to be coming around this this bin. I was able to take this shot just perfect cuz there's this big uh uh uh uh ram just with the horns and everything. And and the way I was able to take the picture, I mean, it should be long in a magazine. I showed it to people like that. You Oh, that's AI. You didn't take that. And I'm like, "Well, actually, I I'll show you the video." And it just so happened this thing wandered right into a guest parking area and and I didn't have to go and do anything. I just pulled up the car and got out and took the picture. But some people didn't even believe me like, "Oh, that that's AI. It's fabricated." I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL THE THINGS THAT YOU FEED on and the things you look at and and the things that you start thinking that's true and that's obtainable. And you know, I was just here. It just reminds me. I was just here at a coffee shop uh uh uh yesterday and and there was this young man in the shop and I got to talking to him a little bit and about the Lord and he was a a young Christian and he he was actually going to be doing a podcast. He was going to be doing a podcast on on uh uh uh comparing yourself and and and you know and I just got to think just talking to him a little bit about that, you know, and and and how uh uh he was just talking about how you get online and and you get on these these social medias and everything like that and it it's all fake. It's all edited AND IT'S JUST THE HIGHLIGHTS of people's LIFE AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU GET ON THERE AND YOU START FEEDING on that stuff, it's an unrealistic expectation of things that you can never obtain. And then you get on THERE AND ALL A SUDDEN YOU GET A SPIRIT OF LUST ON YOU BECAUSE you're lusting after all these things that are they're fake and edited. And I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, LOOK, EVERYTHING THE DEVIL HAS TO offer is fake. LOOK, I'VE BEEN OUT there in the world and I've ran after the things of the world. AND I WAS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD FOR A LONG TIME. AND AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, EVERYTHING THAT THE DEVIL HAD TO OFFER ME WAS JUST A FAKE. IT WAS JUST A BOGUS. THERE WAS NO LIFE. IT WAS JUST DEATH. THERE WAS NO DRUGS. THERE WAS NO ALCOHOL. THERE WAS NOTHING OUT THERE THAT COULD EVER FILL UH THAT VOID AND THAT HUNGER ON THE INSIDE OF ME. I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REAL. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, IT AIN'T OUT IN THE WORLD. IT AIN'T ON SOME WEBSITE. IT AIN'T SOME BOY. IT AIN'T SOME GIRL. IT AIN'T SOME CAREER. IT AIN'T SOME JOB. IT AIN'T SOME BIG HOUSE. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT'LL EVER FILL THAT VOID INSIDE OF YOUR HEART. THAT'S THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST TO YOU PERSONALLY. THAT THIS MESSAGE IS THE ONLY SALVATION IN THE END TIME. I WANT TO TELL YOU, LOOK, I I I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY OUT OF HERE. I KNOW GOD SENT A VINDICATED PROPHET JUST LIKE HE SAID NOAH. AND IF YOU WANT TO GO IN THE RAPTURE, YOU BETTER GET ON THE BOAT. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING ELSE IS SINKING. SAID, I TRIED IT OUT THERE. I WENT OUT THERE. I WANT TO TELL YOU, OH, AND NOTHING OUT THERE CAN COMPARE. &gt;&gt; AND I LIKE TO SAY THIS, MY BEST day as a sinner &gt;&gt; is worse than my worst day as a Christian. Oh, I like saying that. &gt;&gt; Oh, because when you get some evidence in your life, &gt;&gt; I started telling this young man, I was like, "Look, we're not we don't we don't compare ourselves to the world." I said, "We actually are supposed to compare oursel to the word." &gt;&gt; I said, "The scripture said, let this mind BE IN YOU, WHICH WAS ALSO in Christ Jesus, who thought it not robbery TO BE EQUAL WITH GOD." And he kind of looked at me. I said, "Well, let me let me just say it LIKE A LIKE A PROPHET OF GOD SAID. HE HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IN A LITTLE WHILE THE WORLD seeth me no more, but you shall see me, BUT I PERSONAL PRONOUN, I'LL BE WITH YOU, EVEN IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He says, THEN THEN GO SEE WHAT HE DID. &gt;&gt; SEE THE WORKS THAT HE did and then look at your own life and then compare yourself. Now look, SATAN ALWAYS WANTS TO TURN QUOTES around and condemn us &gt;&gt; when they should encourage you that there's more for you. &gt;&gt; LOOK THAT BY GOD'S GRACE, WE'LL GET TO THERE, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN JOSHUA AND CALEB CAME BACK WITH THE EVIDENCE HERE. They had the evidence that IT WAS EVERYTHING THAT GOD PROMISED. AND SATAN'S ALWAYS THERE TO MAKE AN EVIL REPORT. WELL, YEAH, but Well, yeah, but and SO WHENEVER YOU HEAR SOMETHING IN THE MESSAGE THAT SEEMS LIKE A GREAT CHALLENGE OR SOMETHING LIKE, MY HOW COULD I EVER GET OBTAINED? YOU OUGHT TO JUST GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS. SAY, MAN, I'M CALLED TO THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I COULD LOOK INTO THE WORD AND SAY, WELL, I'M NOT QUITE ADDING UP RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M COMING. &gt;&gt; Some people might BE FURTHER AHEAD OF ME, BUT I'M COMING. BROTHER DONNIE, JUST WAIT A LITTLE WHILE. I MIGHT NOT GET IT ALL FIGURED OUT. I might not GOT ALL THE REVELATION, AND I MIGHT MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES, BUT I'M COMING. WHY? BECAUSE I'M THERE. HALLELUJAH. I can be like THE KID IN THE ice cream shop. I CAN JUST START GETTING HAPPY. HALLELUJAH. It's coming. &gt;&gt; So, just kind of move it in here. You know, YOU KNOW, CHRIST UH SHOULD BE OUR EXAMPLE. &gt;&gt; You know, that that's what we ought to strive TO BE AS A AS A REAL true Christian. And and so we're just moving in this thought HOW UH THE GREAT WARRIOR JOSHUA, HE LED THEM INTO THE PROMISED LAND. And and so they're no LONGER SLAVES AND AND NOW THEY'RE IN THE PROMISED LAND AND AND THEY'RE ENJOYING the blessings and the benefits and they're raising THEIR FAMILY. AND THE PROPHET SHOWS ABOUT HOW EACH ONE OF THEM CAME INTO THAT NATURAL PROMISED LAND. BUT ALL OF THEM HAD TO DIE. AND HE HE SAYS THEN ONE DAY DOWN COME THE GREATEST WARRIOR OF THEM ALL, the Lord Jesus, the son of God. And he SAID THERE IS A land where a man don't die. Amen. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "THEN ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, HE SENT BACK THE EARNEST OF THIS PLACE, the assurance, the evidence that this land is real." JUST LIKE JOSHUA BROUGHT BACK THE EVIDENCE, Jesus brought back the evidence of the Holy Ghost. Now, we reckon ourselves dead. We're buried with him in baptism unto death, and we raise with him in the resurrection. And now we are in already. &gt;&gt; Not we're going to &gt;&gt; we're already raised. OH BY WE ARE NOW NOT WILL BE. WE ARE NOW TONIGHT SETTING IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; LOOK, THIS IS NOT JUST SOME HOPE SO GOSPEL WHERE WE WHERE WE JUST COME TOGETHER AND WE TALK ABOUT SOME PIE IN THE SKY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN NEVER BE OBTAINED AND AND WE JUST KIND OF COME UP WITH CATCHPHRASES AND THINGS TO GET ALL EXCITED ABOUT AND AND AND that your FAITH MIGHT REST IN and in in in the the EXCELLENCY OF SPEECH AND THE WISDOM OF MAN. LOOK, THAT'S NOT WHY THE GOSPEL CAME. THIS GOSPEL CAME IN POWER AND MANIFESTATION OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT YOUR FAITH WOULD NOT REST IN THE WISDOM OF MAN BUT REST IN THE POWER OF GOD. AND I LIKE HOW THE PROPHET OF GOD PICKS UP THAT SCRIPTURE AND CHRIST THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED AND HE SAYS IN THE POWER OF GOD TO CHANGE the [screaming] man. HEY, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TONIGHT IS WE NEED TO BE changed &gt;&gt; from THE YOUNGEST TO THE OLDEST. I DON'T CARE IF WE'VE BEEN IN THE MESSAGE OUR WHOLE LIFE. I SAY, "OH, I NEED TO BE CHANGED. LORD, MAKE ME MORE LIKE YOU, LORD. MORE MORE OF YOUR MEEKNESS, MORE OF YOUR HUMILITY, LORD, I WANT TO SEE THE EVIDENCE OF THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; WELL, MY BIBLE TELLS ME IF THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS CHRIST FROM THE DEAD DWELL IN YOU, &gt;&gt; IT WILL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL BODY. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, YES, THERE'S COMING A FINAL QUICKENING WHEN WE'LL DROP THIS MORTAL BODY AND WE'LL STEP INTO A THEOPHONY. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT TO BE QUICKENED. There's a quickening POWER RIGHT NOW HERE TO QUICKEN THE PREDESTINATED SEED ON THE INSIDE of you. AND IT'LL QUICKEN THE WAY YOU THINK. IT'LL QUICKEN THE WAY YOU ACT. IT'LL QUICKEN YOUR THOUGHTS. IT'LL QUICKEN YOUR IDEAS. IT WILL QUICKEN YOU TO THE WORD. IT WILL QUICKEN YOU TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IF YOU'RE BEING QUICKENED TO OTHER THINGS, TO MAN'S IDEAS AND MAN'S OPINIONS AND TO WEBSITES AND JEBUSITES AND ALL THESE THINGS, I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S NOT THE RIGHT SPIRIT. BUT THERE IS THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT IS HERE. HE CAN SET YOU FREE FROM ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND HE CAN QUICKEN YOU BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST TO THE WORD OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; OH, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, HE SAID, WHEN YOU GET THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, THAT'S THE EARNEST of your salvation. Is that right? IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S THE DOWN PAYMENT. And if it'll MAKE US FEEL LIKE THIS ON A DOWN PAYMENT, WHAT WILL IT DO WHEN WE GET THE full benefit? &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise man. &gt;&gt; Am I talking about salvation? &gt;&gt; Do I need to talk about something else to get you excited? &gt;&gt; We need to talk about some ball games. We need to talk about some sports. &gt;&gt; We need to talk about the latest and the greatest tech. &gt;&gt; We We ARE WE ARE THERE. THERE IS A PROMISED LAND THAT WE ARE GOING TO &gt;&gt; WHERE WE SHALL NEVER DIE. &gt;&gt; AND THOSE THAT WE LOVE [screaming] AND HOLD DEAR WILL SEE THEM AGAIN. And I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE HAVEN'T LOST ONE THING. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, THAT WHEN YOU GET THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S THE EARNEST. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE DOWN PAYMENT THAT YOU ARE YOU ALL THESE THINGS ARE YOURS. &gt;&gt; And the PROPHET'S SAYING, IF IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE THAT down here, &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE WHEN WE GET THERE? It ought to make YOU JUST AS EXCITED LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY SON. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We are going to a land where we never get old. NO, I KNOW Y'ALL young people don't got to worry about it, but no more hurting back and no more aching knees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And maybe some of you are, but you know what? YOU KNOW, TIME GOES ON A LITTLE BIT, YOU START appreciating that a little bit more. &gt;&gt; BUT I SAY IT OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, SAINTS. I WELL, I'M TRYING to minister to you a little bit on the evidence of salvation. THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING EVIDENT in your life. There ought to BE SOMETHING THAT YOU POSSESS THAT IT OUGHT TO MEAN something to you. I remember one time I was at Louisiana camp many years ago and you know the the the spirit of the Lord was just moving so precious and you know it was back when when the building was split in half between a gym and a and a sanctuary and and it just seemed like all the kids that were coming through the prayer line and everything they they were all ending back up in in the gym and I just remember uh uh uh it was just such a wonderful thing. We're back there just uh just just praying and and praying with certain other young people and and and you could just see the the spirit of the Lord. It was like a wave. It would just move upon a group here and and go around. I remember it just coming over there. Oh, and there's nothing like it. It just hit the little group we were there praying with and and all a sudden this little boy, he threw us up threw up his arms. HE SAID, "IT'S REAL. IT'S REALLY REAL. IT'S NOT A STORY ANYMORE." OH, I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT IT IS, SAINTS OF GOD. WHEN THIS MESSAGE AIN'T A STORY ANYMORE. IT AIN'T A BUNCH OF RULES AND REGULATIONS AND I GOT TO WEAR MY DRESS LIKE THIS AND MY HAIR LIKE THAT AND I CAN'T GO OVER THERE AND I CAN'T GO THERE. LOOK, THAT'S JUST A BUNCH OF THAT'S JUST A THAT'S JUST YOU TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK BY YOUR OWN WORKS AND THAT'S JUST YOU LOOKING AT UH SOMETHING THAT'S A liberty to everything ELSE, BUT IT'S MORE OF A BONDAGE TO YOU. BUT WHEN YOU CATCH A REVELATION THAT IT IS THE GRACE OF GOD AND YOU'VE MET HIM FOR YOURSELF, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU REALIZE, LOOK, MAN, THIS AIN'T THIS AIN'T SOME STORY. THIS AIN'T SOMETHING THAT'S FAKE. THIS AIN'T SOMETHING JUST MY MOMMY AND MY DADDY AND MY PRE PREACHERS AND ALL THESE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. BUT WHEN YOU MEET JESUS CHRIST FACE TO FACE, YOU CAN THROW YOUR HANDS UP TO SAY IT'S NOT A STORY ANYMORE. IT'S REALLY, REALLY REAL. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT CAN HAPPEN FOR YOU TONIGHT. IF IT'S JUST BEEN A STORY AND IT'S JUST BUILT WITHIN THE RULES OF REGULATION AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAS A TESTIMONY AND YOU DON'T HAVE NO TESTIMONY, IT DON'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD, BUT HE'S JUST LOOKING FOR YOU TO MAKE A SURRENDER. AND I SAY, WHY NOT TONIGHT BE THE NIGHT THAT YOU CAN GET THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR SALVATION AND your inheritance and you can just surrender YOURSELF AND COME INTO THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. [applause] &gt;&gt; THEN IT'S A JOY TO SERVE HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OLD THINGS PASS AWAY. ALL THINGS BECOME NEW. &gt;&gt; You're a new creature. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Religion is a covering, but salvation is freedom." Salvation is freedom. Yes. &gt;&gt; So when we when we see the word of God and the standard and maybe in your heart you know there's things that are right and you don't do it and it's more of a a burden to you to try and you do good for so long. That should speak to something in your heart to say there's something more for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, I I don't know why I keep coming back to this, but I didn't have to talk my son into going to the ice cream shop. &gt;&gt; I didn't have say, "Well, son, you don't understand. Like, it tastes really good. You know, you'll really like it. &gt;&gt; It'll it'll give you so much energy. You'll be bouncing off the walls and your parents will wonder why we ever took you there. Right. But but when when when you're born again and you get a new nature, &gt;&gt; I don't I don't got to be talked into it. &gt;&gt; EVEN IF I EVEN IF I REALIZE THERE'S AN AREA IN MY LIFE THAT maybe I haven't totally got the victory, something in my heart will say amen to the word of God. Lord, I know you promised it. It's it's it's NOT A IT'S NOT a burden. I've shared this many times when when I got converted and I got uh born again and filled with the Holy Ghost. You know, it was just a couple days later I was I was at my job and and forgive me for, you know, this is just what happened. I you know, lunch came up and I thought, you know, I'm I I I go I'll go next door to the pub and have a beer and I GOT FOUR FEET FOR YOU KNOW, I STARTED walking all I said [laughter] I don't even drink anymore. That's funny. And I turned around and walked right back TO MY STATION. NOW, IF I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN DOWN, oh man, I'm a Christian. I can't do that anymore. You see now? You see the difference? &gt;&gt; Now, once again, I'm trying TO HELP YOU YOUNG PEOPLE. I IT THAT'S THAT'S A BONDAGE. THAT'S A THAT THAT THAT MEANS SOMETHING ELSE GOTS A HOLD OF YOU. AND AND DON'T LET SATAN UH CONDEMN YOU AND HOLD YOU IN BONDAGE. THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU. SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? SALVATION IS FREEDOM. AND IF I DON'T HAVE A FREEDOM in the message OF THE HOUR, IF I DON'T HAVE A FREEDOM TO WEAR MY HAIR LONG, AND IF I DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DRESS IN MODESTY, AND YOU YOUNG MEN, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM NOT TO GIVE INTO THOSE JOKES AND TO GO ONTO THEM WEBSITES AND TO CONSTANTLY BE BOMBARDED WITH LUST AND NEVER HAVE THE VICTORY, I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE IS AN EVIDENCE OF SALVATION THAT WILL BRING PURE LIBERTY AND FREEDOM THAT YOU CAN BE FREE FROM THOSE THINGS. Now certainly WE CAN WE CAN MAKE MISTAKES AND IF WE DON'T UH IF WE'RE NOT PRAYED UP AND and and and we're not doing THE THINGS THAT WE DO. LOOK UH YOU YOU A TEST WILL COME AND YOU'LL YOU'LL FAIL THE TEST AND YOU'LL REALIZE WELL PRAISE GOD FOR THE TEST. I I AIN'T BEEN PRAYING LIKE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRAYING. I I HAVEN'T BEEN READING MY BIBLE LIKE I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PRAYING. AND THE SON OF GOD WILL REPENT. HE'LL GET UP AND KEEP GOING ON WITH GOD. BUT IF YOU'RE JUST ALWAYS STRUGGLING AND YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING AND AND YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FIT, THAT'S BECAUSE THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A DEATH. THAT FIRST NATURE HAS TO DIE. AND THEN THE NATURE OF CHRIST HAS TO COME. YOU GOT TO GET THAT NATURE OF A LAMB. &gt;&gt; That will say yes Lord. Amen Lord. And then it becomes a liberty. It becomes a freedom. &gt;&gt; Well, let me say it like this. I don't need the internet to be happy. I don't need social media to be happy. &gt;&gt; I don't need somebody to tell me I look good to be happy. I don't need my job or any of these things to tell me. Why? Because I am not even of this world. I come from another world. I came from this world. &gt;&gt; I salvation and my satisfaction from this world. I GET MY SATISFACTION FROM THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. I GET MY JOY AND MY SATISFACTION [applause] FROM JESUS CHRIST. I GET MY JOY AND MY SATISFACTION FROM THE REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR. I DON'T NEED NO DRUGS. I DON'T NEED NO ALCOHOL. I don't need no [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; That makes me happy. &gt;&gt; I SAID THAT MAKES ME HAPPY. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD GET YOU DOWN &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL LIKE NOTHING'S GOING RIGHT, START TO THINK ABOUT YOUR INHERITANCE. START TO THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING. THERE'S A LAND BEYOND THE RIVER. THEY CALL THE SWEET FOREVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] THAT'S WHERE I GET MY JOY. THAT'S WHERE I GET MY HAPPINESS. THAT'S WHERE I GET MY PEACE. &gt;&gt; And to think, this is JUST A SMALL LITTLE TASTE. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. I pray that somebody here this evening that the evidence of salvation will become real to you. And I just want TO SAY IT'S NOT YOUR good works. &gt;&gt; It's not your efforts. &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, we'll get to this a little later, but I want to show you how IT WAS NEVER YOUR good works or your efforts that warranted salvation. So then when you receive the evidence of salvation, you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, IT WAS NEVER YOUR GOOD WORKS THAT WARRANTED you to get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN SOMEHOW, YOUNG PEOPLE, WE DO SOMETHING BAD AND WE LOSE IT. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to preach to you tonight. &gt;&gt; SATAN KEEPS TRYING TO ROB YOU OF A TRUE EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. But it WAS NEVER YOUR GOOD WORKS THAT MADE YOU EARN IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO IT AIN'T YOUR BAD WORKS THAT CAN LOSE IT. OH, I FEEL PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW. IT WASN'T YOUR GOOD WORKS THAT SAVED YOU. IT AIN'T YOUR BAD WORKS THAT UNSAVE YOU. &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT OUGHT TO MAKE SOMEBODY GET HAPPY. THAT OUGHT TO MAKE SOMEBODY SHOUT TO KNOW THAT THIS THING'S RIGGED. I CAN'T LOSE. [applause] I CAN NO MORE DIE THAN GOD CAN DIE. HEY, THAT'S WHAT A PROPHET TOLD ME. IF YOU HAD ETERNAL LIFE, YOU ALWAYS HAD ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; NOW, I AIN'T DOING AWAY WITH GOOD WORKS. WE'LL GET THERE ALSO. BUT I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU THE SCRIPTURE SAYS IN EPHESIANS 2:8, "FOR BY grace &gt;&gt; you ARE SAVED THROUGH FAITH, AND NOT OF YOURSELVES. IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD, NOT OF WORKS, &gt;&gt; LEST ANY MAN CAN BOAST." &gt;&gt; So listen to how the prophet SAYS THIS IN THE PHILADELPHIA church age. Now works are fine but they don't save you. &gt;&gt; Now we we God does a tremendous work in our life. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? WHEN GOD DOES A TRUE WORK IN your life, the test is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Donnie can correct me if I'm wrong, BUT YOU DON'T PASS EVERY SINGLE ONE of them &gt;&gt; the first time. GOD DID SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; NOW, I I WHAT I WANT TO TRY TO GET TO YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, QUIT LOOKING AT THE SYMPTOMS. &gt;&gt; Quit looking at the giants IN THE LAND. &gt;&gt; QUIT LOOKING AT ALL THE THINGS YOU GOT TO OVERCOME. &gt;&gt; Look at the promise. &gt;&gt; YOU COME TO THE ALTAR. YOU PRAYED. YOU REPENTED OF YOUR SINS. YOU GOT UP WITH FAITH IN YOUR HEART. YOU CONFESSED. AND SALVATION IS MADE. CONFESSION. SALVATION IS MADE UNDER CONFESSION. AND YOU PROFESS, I'M A BORNAG AGAIN SON OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And then you come to the test &gt;&gt; and you fail. &gt;&gt; Does that change that you're a son or daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Should that change your confession? I I &gt;&gt; works don't save you in the first place. &gt;&gt; Hold on. This is a vindicated prophet. I love this stuff. They don't make you perfect. &gt;&gt; That's right. YOU MEAN ALL THIS TIME I'VE HAD THE HOLY GHOST AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF PERFECT BY MY OWN EFFORT BY MY OWN ABILITY AND EVERY TEST AND EVERY TRIAL. IF I FAIL IT OR IF I PASS IT, I'M MEASURING MY SUCCESS BY MY ABILITIES. AND YOU ARE NEVER [screaming] CALLED &gt;&gt; TO MEASURE YOUR SALVATION AND THE GRACE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE BY YOUR WORKS. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T MAKE YOU PERFECT. IT IS CHRIST or perish. And it is NOT EVEN CHRIST AND WORKS. &gt;&gt; It is Christ alone. &gt;&gt; This age began in the years of ARMENIANISM THAT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN CHRIST as a reality. IT DOES NOT SING OF NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD. FOR IT SINGS OF NOTHING BUT the blood and my own conduct. OH, IF THE DEVIL HAS HASN'T EVER BEEN ON a rampage with us to THINK THAT IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR GOOD EFFORTS AND OUR GOOD WORKS IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT AIN'T NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD AND YOUR OWN GOOD WORKS. IT'S NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD AND IT IS CHRIST ALONE. &gt;&gt; NOW, I believe in good conduct. If you are saved, you will do righteously. We have already gone over that. But let me tell you now, salvation is not Jesus plus. &gt;&gt; It is Jesus alone. &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord from start to finish. IT IS ALL GOD. LET HIS LIFE be in me. LET IT BE HIS BLOOD THAT CLEANSES ME. LET IT BE HIS SPIRIT THAT FILLS ME. LET IT BE HIS WORD IN MY HEART AND IN MY MOUTH. LET IT BE HIS STRIPES THAT HEAL ME. LET IT BE JESUS AND JESUS ALONE, NOT BY WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH I HAVE DONE. NO SIR, CHRIST IS MY LIFE. YOU ARE NOT SAVED BY YOUR GOOD WORKS. YOU ARE SAVED BY THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. SALVATION IS OF THE LORD FROM START TO FINISH. MY BIBLE SAYS AND NEITHER IS THERE SALVATION IN ANY OTHER. FOR THERE IS NO OTHER NAME UNDER HEAVEN GIVEN AMONG MEN WHEREBY MEN MUST BE SAVED OTHER THAN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT'S THE NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES. THERE'S NO NAME GREATER. THERE'S NO NAME HIGHER. EVERY TONGUE AND EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW AND CONFESS THAT HE IS THE LORD OF LORDS. HE IS THE KING OF KINGS. HE IS THE ALPHA. HE IS THE OMEGA. HE IS THE ROSE OF SHARED. HE IS THE OFFSPRING OF DAVID. HE'S THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR. HE'S THE GOD THAT CONQUERS ALL. HE CONQUERED DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE. HE IS MY SAVIOR AND MY SALVATION IS HIM AND HIM ALONE. LET IT BE HIS BLOOD THAT CLEANSES ME. LET IT BE HIS SPIRIT THAT FILLS ME. LET IT BE HIS WORD IN MY HEART AND IN MY MOUTH. LET IT BE HIS STRIPES THAT HEAL ME. LET IT BE JESUS AND JESUS ALONE, NOT BY WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH I HAVE DONE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, praise his wonderful name. But you don't understand, brother Matthew. I've gone too far. I've tried so many times. Just this recent camp, maybe I went to the altar. I experienced the Lord. I even confessed I had the Holy Ghost and I w I went right back and I got mixed up in this thing and now I'm lost. Now I there's no hope for me. Says who? My Bible said where sin abound, &gt;&gt; grace &gt;&gt; did much more abound. &gt;&gt; Devil, I don't care how much sin. I don't care about how much unbelief. I don't CARE HOW MANY FAULTS. I DON'T CARE HOW MANY FAILURES. YOU CAN POINT TO THIS MISTAKE. YOU CAN POINT TO THAT MISTAKE. YOU CAN SAY, "I'M THE WORST SINNER there ever was in the world." But then MY LORD AND SAVIOR WHO CONQUERED DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE, HE CAME BACK AND SAID, "SON, IT DON'T MATTER WHERE SIN ABOUND. Grace did much MORE ABOUND." THERE'S GRACE FOR EVERY WEAKNESS. THERE'S GRACE FOR EVERY TRIAL. THERE'S GRACE FOR EVERY MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; I don't KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I FEEL PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW CUZ I I DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT. I MAKE MISTAKES. I FALL FLAT ON MY FACE, BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT I'M A SON OF GOD. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT I'M GOING TO RAPTURE. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT I GOT THE HOLY GHOST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M AN HEIR. &gt;&gt; FIRST THESSALONIANS 5:9. FOR GOD HATH not appointed us under wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus. Now, we'll try to start moving towards a close. Hallelujah. The prophet says, now we've moved to that sermon he's been referring to and possessing all things. He says, "Hallelujah. There you are. This is my story. This is my song. I'm an heir of salvation. Look, I I I don't know where where each of you are at in the journey. I know there's some here that you're only here because your parents made you come. And I was I was there. That's okay. That's all right. Maybe some of you, you're you're struggling in sanctification. Maybe you've been born again and filled with the Holy. Maybe you're believing for the Holy Ghost. Maybe you made a confession and and here at this last camp, you went right back and went into the same traps that you you were believing and professing to be out uh uh delivered from. &gt;&gt; Listen to this now. But I'm wanting I'm wanting us to start looking at the word. Look at the promise. Look at the evidence. &gt;&gt; Look at what God has done. Look at what he's doing. Look at where you are. &gt;&gt; And if you know you need him, then you need to make a decision. &gt;&gt; I I I made the decision when I was 21 years old. I could have saved myself a lot of scars, a lot of heartache. I'm an heir of salvation. What is salvation? It's something that's given to you. It's a gift. Are are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; I'M HEIR OF SALVATION. WHAT KIND? FOR ETERNAL LIFE. SALVATION for my soul. Salvation for my body. SALVATION FOR MY WEARINESS. SALVATION FOR EVERYTHING. GOD MADE ME HEIR OF EVERYTHING THROUGH CHRIST. AND HE DIED AND ROSE AND RETURNED BACK AND BROUGHT THE EVIDENCE AND POURED IT OUT UPON US. OH. OH MY GLORY. OH MY. NOW YOU YOU YOU GO UP THERE. WHAT DO YOU DO? WE WE YOU GO UP JUST LIKE ABRAHAM DID. GO UP THERE WITH THAT PROMISE. GOD, you told me it's mine. I got faith in your promise. I'm bringing your word. You promised this. YOU SAID, "ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE. Seek and you shall find. Ask and it shall be given. Knock and it shall be opened." HERE I AM, LORD. I DON'T KNOW. IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS TO BE DELIVERED? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS TO LIVE AN OVERCOMING LIFE? GOD, IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT LOOKS INTO THE WORD OF GOD? AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S A PROMISE FOR YOU. IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE? &gt;&gt; AM I THE ONLY ONE? YOUNG PEOPLE, HELP ME OUT HERE. IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS DELIVERANCE? IS THERE SOMEBODY here that wants to be an overcomer? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT LOOKS INTO THE WORD OF GOD AND YOU SEE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE THAT AREN'T MEASURING UP? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT SAYS, "LORD, I WANT TO MANIFEST THAT PROMISE IN MY LIFE." THEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT WORD OF GOD AND SAY, "LORD, HERE I AM. I'M COMING IT. I'M KNOCKING. ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE. SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN. KNOCK and it shall be open. Here I am, Lord. I'm here. I'M KNOCKING. I'M SEEKING. I'M ASKING. I'VE GOT TO RECEIVE IT. THERE YOU ARE. SOMETHING TAKES PLACE when you lay that word down. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Young people, GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOME OF YOU TONIGHT TO LAY THAT WORD DOWN AND SAY, "I'M STAKING IT ALL ON YOUR WORD. LORD, YOU PROMISED IT AND I'M STAYING WITH IT. I DON'T CARE HOW HARD IT GETS. I DON'T CARE HOW THE DEVIL RAGES AND HOW HE ROARS AND HOW HE TRIES TO POINT TO THIS FOG AND THIS FAILURE. LORD, YOU PROMISED IT AND I'M AN HEIR OF ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; LOOK, it's all yours. You're an heir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A JOY, PEACE, DELIVERANCE, THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; SO, we just we'll end along these lines here with the help of God. SO, HERE IN OUR TEXT, JOSHUA BROUGHT BACK THE EVIDENCE. Here it is. [snorts] He said, "It's a a land flowing with milk and honey." Maybe the kids are like, "Where's the bucket of milk?" Oh, it's it's it's a a land plentiful. It's it has a bunch of fruits and a and it it has everything that we have need of. It's a fertile land and IT HAS EVERYTHING. OH, OKAY. OKAY. AND HERE'S JOSHUA SAYING, "HEY, it's everything that God said it was." &gt;&gt; But guess who's right there to bring up an evil report. &gt;&gt; So that's where we continue in Numbers 13:28. It says, "Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and very great. And moreover, we saw the children of Anoch there. The Amalocites dwell in the land of the south, and the Hittites, the Jebsites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and BY THE COAST OF JORDAN." And now, what's happening? ALL OF A SUDDEN, JOSHUA AND CALEB have brought back an evidence. But isn't it funny how the devil has his own evidence? &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you fight right now. I'm trying to help you ON HOW GOD GIVES YOU AN EVIDENCE. GOD GIVES YOU AN EXPERIENCE. GOD BLESSES YOU. YOU HAVE AN EXPERIENCE. YOU KNOW, MAYBE MAYBE IT'S AN EXPERIENCE OF JUSTIFICATION. MAYBE MAYBE YOU'RE IN THAT THAT WORK OF SANCTIFICATION. MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN UH UH BORN AGAIN AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU HAVE AN EVIDENCE THE GRACE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE. GOD IS DOING SOMETHING. AND AS SOON AS YOU START TO PRESENT THE EVIDENCE and you SAY, "LOOK WHAT GOD DID FOR ME. I BROTHER D. I WAS REALLY BLESSED AT CAMP LAST TIME. GOD REALLY COME BY AND HE HE HE HE TOUCHED ME AND I'M REALLY ON FIRE FOR GOD." AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT DEVIL COMES UP AND SAYS, "YEAH, but Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you got to go back to school. &gt;&gt; You You got to go to work. You got to go back out and, you know, YOU GOT TO DO ALL THESE THINGS AND WELL, WHAT ABOUT THIS AND YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THAT AND YOU LIKE THIS AND you got this channel and you got that and and all these things. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE STARTS TO PAINT THIS big picture OF HOW HARD IT'S GOING TO be &gt;&gt; and how you can Oh, you could never No, that's that's for everybody else. YOU JUST YOU JUST HAVE YOUR little experience, but you can still hold on to all those other things. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; See, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID IN REDEMPTION BY JUDGMENT, HE SAID, "EVERYTHING WITHOUT FAITH IS SIN. Unbelief is absolutely sin. Everything that's not OF FAITH IS NOT OF GOD. You must believe." And the only way you CAN HAVE FAITH IS FIRST SEE WHAT GOD said about it. &gt;&gt; Well, ain't that the only thing that matters? &gt;&gt; And then believe his word. That's the only way you can do it. &gt;&gt; Do I need to read it again? &gt;&gt; SO JOSHUA AND CALEB KNEW THAT GOD had promised and they came back. They wasn't afraid to say, "We can take it." G &gt;&gt; because they based their faith not on what they saw &gt;&gt; but what they believed. &gt;&gt; Now there's the key, young people. Are you looking at the promise or are you looking at the symptoms? Are &gt;&gt; are YOU LOOKING AT THE WORD or are you looking at your ability? &gt;&gt; Are are YOU LOOKING AT THE challenge or are you looking at the promise? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hey, let's get down home where we're living. &gt;&gt; You got friends. We go to school. WE GOT JOBS. things you subscribe to and and you you got apps on your phone you shouldn't have and all these things and and you know you you know that there's A HIGHER CALLING AND A HIGHER CALLING IN THE WAY YOU'RE dressing and a HIGHER CALLING IN THE WAY YOU'RE acting and the people that you're associating with and the things that you're liking and the things that you're subscribing. You know what would Jesus do? I don't think he'd be subscribing to that. I don't think he'd be liking that. I don't think he'd be following that profile. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? There's a lot of things that we're doing. There's a lot of things that we're subscribing to. And then we we make a profession. We say, "You know what? I really do. I'm going to I'm going to clean up my life." But then what happens? Satan's right there to start trying to make a compromise and try to say, "Well, you don't have to give up this. You don't have to give up that." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I like verse 30. It says, "AND CALEB STEALED the people before Moses [snorts] and said, 'Let us go over at once and possess it, for we are well able &gt;&gt; to overcome it." &gt;&gt; I'm wondering, DO WE HAVE SOME JOSHUA and Caleb still? is there's some young men and some young women &gt;&gt; THAT REGARDLESS OF THE OPPOSITION, &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF ALL THE GIANTS, REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD LADY OSIA LOOKS, NO MATTER H HOW HARD IT MIGHT LOOK AT SCHOOL, HOW HARD IT MIGHT LOOK AT YOUR JOB, IS THERE SOME JOSHUA AND CALEBS THAT'LL STAND UP AND SAY, "LOOK, I DON'T CARE HOW DARK IT IS IN LADY OSIA. I DON'T CARE HOW BAD THE ENTICEMENTS ARE. I DON'T CARE HOW BAD BIG THE GIANTS ARE. WE ARE WELL MORE ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND BECAUSE GOD PROMISED IT. IT'S OUR INHERITANCE. LOOK, YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW YOURSELF DOWN TO THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW YOURSELF DOWN TO THAT NONSENSE. YOU CAN LOOK AT GOD'S WORD AND SAY, "GOD PROMISED IT. IT'S MY INHERITANCE. I CAN HAVE TOTAL VICTORY. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GIANTS OF DEPRESSION. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GIANTS OF PORNOGRAPHY AND ALL THEM THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. GOD, GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST TO DEFEAT EVERY SINGLE DEVIL AND EVERY SINGLE DEMON. AND WE ARE WELL MORE ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND. COME ON, YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU CAN TAKE THE LAND. YOU CAN DO IT. YOU CAN PUT EVERY DEVIL, EVERY COMPLEX, EVERY SIN, EVERY OH, COME ON. YOU'RE MORE THAN ABLE TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR INHERITANCE. IT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN CALLED TO DO. [applause] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God SAID, "THE PROMISE IS YOURS." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But if you ever get it, &gt;&gt; you ain't going to get it easy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan captures your health. &gt;&gt; You got a right to say, "Satan, give it back. &gt;&gt; Hand it over. I come in the name of the Lord, the possessor of heaven and earth, and I'm heir. GIVE IT BACK. YOU TOOK MY CHILD. YOU GOT HER MIXED UP WITH THE WRONG BOY. YOU TOOK MY BOY AND YOU MIXED HIM UP WITH the wrong girl. I CLAIM THEM. THAT'S RIGHT. I CLAIM MY CHILDREN. I CLAIM MY BROTHER. I CLAIM MY SISTER. &gt;&gt; NOW, maybe you're that boy. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're that girl &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL TRAPPED AND YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO WAY OUT AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. &gt;&gt; We have a right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I feel it right now. I have a right as a son of God to say, "SATAN, YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF GOD'S PROPERTY. &gt;&gt; GIVE THEM BACK IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I CLAIM MY BROTHER. I CLAIM MY SISTER. YOU GOT THEM MIXED UP OUT THERE IN THE WORLD WITH SOME BOY OR SOME GIRL OR SOME TEMPTATION OR SOME LESS DEVIL. I REBUKE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I CLAIM THEM FOR THE GLORY OF ALMIGHTY GOD. YOU CAN BE FREE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; NOW, I want to speak to somebody. If you've never received the Holy Ghost as yet, don't know nothing about it. We've been preaching on the evidence of salvation. And maybe somebody here's like, "I don't even have a clue. What does that even mean?" Holy Ghost. I hear all about the Holy Ghost. If you've never received the Holy Ghost as of yet and don't know nothing about it and something in your heart telling you that you want it, &gt;&gt; you stay right there. &gt;&gt; That's eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's what you're heir to. &gt;&gt; Stay right there and look Satan right in the face and say, &gt;&gt; "You mean you you don't even have to have the Holy Ghost yet?" That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU MEAN I HAVE AUTHORITY AS A SON OF GOD EVEN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. WHAT ARE WE TAPPING INTO, young people? &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL TRIES TO SAY, "WELL, YOU DON'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST. YOU DON'T GOT THIS, AND YOU DON'T GOT THAT, AND A VINDICATED PROPHET COMES AROUND, SAYS, "IF YOU DON'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT, YOU LOOK SATAN RIGHT IN THE FACE AND SAY, YOU ARE THE ROBBER. YOU ARE THE ONE I'VE COME TO POSSESS WHAT JESUS CHRIST DIED for &gt;&gt; for ME TO HAVE. NOW HAND IT BACK. GET OUT OF MY WAY. THEN THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW, THE HOLY GHOST WILL POUR DOWN UPON YOU. THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS. SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN. HALLELUJAH. GOD VINDICATES HIS WORD. I SAY EVERYBODY IN HERE, YOU GOT TO LOOK THAT OLD DEVIL IN THE FACE AND SAY, "SATAN, YOU'RE THE OLD ROBBER. GOD, GIVE IT TO ME. GIVE IT BACK. I'M GOING TO TAKE BACK THE JOY OF MY SALVATION. I'M TAKING BACK MY PEACE. I'M TAKING BACK MY VICTORY. I'M TAKING BACK MY SONG. I'M TAKING BACK MY DANCE. I AM A SON OF GOD. I'M A CHILD OF GOD. I'M HEIR OF ALL THINGS. I AM DELIVERED. I AM FREE. I DO GOT THE HOLY GHOST. I DO GOT JOY. I DO GOT PEACE. I AM GOING TO RAPTURE. I AM GOING TO GET MY HEALING. I'LL GET MY BROTHER. I'LL GET MY SISTER. I'LL CLAIM THEM. IF THEY GOT MIXED UP IN THE THINGS OF THE WORLD, I CLAIM THEM FOR THE GLORY OF ALMIGHTY GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. [cheering] &gt;&gt; SATAN, YOU'RE THE ROBBER. &gt;&gt; The musicians will come. &gt;&gt; He is the captain &gt;&gt; OF OUR SALVATION. &gt;&gt; Salvation is of THE LORD WHOM THE SON HAS MADE free is free [screaming] indeed. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if somebody wants to say like Caleb and Joshua, &gt;&gt; LET US GO UP AT once and possess it &gt;&gt; for we are well able to overcome it. &gt;&gt; Just what Joshua did for the children of Israel, Joshua means savior. THE WORD JOSHUA. AND THAT'S the same thing Jesus done for the church when they killed him. He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered THE GRAVE. HE ROSE up again with THE EVIDENCE, THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, THAT THERE IS A LAND BEYOND THE RIVER THAT THEY CALL THE SWEET FOREVER. AMEN. HE COME BACK AND BROUGHT US AN EVIDENCE. WHAT DOES IT DO, BROTHER BRANDHAM? IT MAKES YOU STOP YOUR LYING, STEALING, DRINKING, CURSING, IMMORALS, EVERYTHING. IT MAKES A new creature OUT OF YOU. I WHO WAS ONCE DEAD IN SIN AND TRESPASSES, NEVERTHELESS, I LIVE, NOT ME, BUT CHRIST LIVES IN ME. I'M A NEW CREATURE IN CHRIST JESUS. AMEN. HEIR TO the promise. HALLELUJAH. YES, SIR. THAT LAND BELONGS TO US. HOW DO YOU KNOW? JOSHUA ROSE FROM THE DEAD, BROUGHT BACK THE EVIDENCE, THE HOLY GHOST, AND I GOT IT. AMEN. GLORY. I'M AN HEIR. I'M A CHILD OF THE KING, [screaming] HEIR TO ALL THINGS. I WANT TO TELL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, THERE IS A REAL BORN-AGAIN EXPERIENCE. AND BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. DON'T YOU LET ANY PREACHER, DON'T YOU LET ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU THAT IT WAS FOR A DAY GONE BY. THERE IS A REAL BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST WHERE YOU MEET THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND IT'LL CHANGE YOU IN A MOMENT. I WANT TO TELL YOU JUST ONE ONE MOMENT IN HIS PRESENCE. IT'LL CHANGE EVERYTHING. IT'LL CHANGE YOUR SITUATION. IT'LL CHANGE WHAT YOU'RE BATTLING. [applause] &gt;&gt; And I want to invite you &gt;&gt; to receive the evidence of salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Why don't you all stand as we sing something? &gt;&gt; Why don't you just play something? Look, I I don't know maybe where to go from here, but I kind of wanted to preach something [music] different, but Lord just kept bringing this back to me. You ask me, "Brother Matthew, what does salvation mean to you?" I was such a rotten sinner. I was deserving to go to hell. I've done so many bad things. Oh, if Satan could point to a past, he could try to point to mine, but it wouldn't do him any good. Cuz my Bible says, "If you call upon the name of the Lord, you shall be saved." And one day I had gotten myself into some pretty big messes in trouble with the law and I was wanting to clean up my life and I realized I didn't have the strength. I didn't have the ability. I wanted to but there was something else there saying no way. I remember saying God whatever this is it's bigger than me and I need your help. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And it was that day that the Holy Spirit dropped down into my life. I made a move for him. Maybe I could share this portion another time, but I made a move for God. I I meant business. I I made an action and all a sudden the sweetest presence, the greatest feeling just dropped down and it changed me. I I got a new nature. I became a new creature. That's God's transforming power and [music] my past just became a testimony. Just like the woman at the well, [music] she went to the well and the word started to discern her thought, the thoughts of intents of her heart. And just think, the very reason she was at the well that time of day is [music] because she was an outcast. But when she met the Lord Jesus, she ran back with a joy into the city and said, "Come see a man [music] who told me all the things that I've done." Look, I know that many of us have grown up in church and we've grown up on message pews and sometimes it's real hard when we've made mistakes and we've done things we shouldn't have done. We feel like there's a microscope. But I want to tell you one moment in his presence, we'll turn all that into just to a testimony. [music] Is there somebody here that wants to experience that? I I I'm I'm just leaving this up to the Lord. How however the Lord would move, I'm I'm just asking, you know, is I just want to see God do something for you that he [music] did for me. A true change. Not not trying to not struggling and pulling [music] and trying and doing good for 2 months and 6 months and falling back to bondage to certain things and only to feel like to start it over again. Am I talking to somebody? Is there somebody here know? [music] Help me out. Young people, come on. Look, we're all in this together. There's no big eyes. There's no big You know what I We're we're all we're all fighting [music] this fight of faith. We're all living in Lady OC in the most wicked age there ever was and seems like the devil's pressing on every every side and we make mistakes and and we go through hard times and and [music] we fall short. But you know what? There's grace. Where sin abound, grace did much more abound. [music] Hey, we'll just start singing this song and just see how the Lord will deal with our hearts. Help me sing it. [snorts] Freedom is [singing] here. [music] Hallelujah. Freedom is [singing] here and I believe it. [singing] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just accept it tonight, young people? [music] &gt;&gt; Freedom. &gt;&gt; Freedom's here is here. [singing] Deliverance is here. Salvation is here. Healing is here. &gt;&gt; Freedom is [singing and music] here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, freedom [singing] is here. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I receive [singing] it. Lord. Oh, freom [singing and music] is here. Oh, freom is [singing and music] here. [music] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just pray where you're at? Why don't you just &gt;&gt; make an altar in your heart? If you feel like you [music] want to move to an altar, there's an altar here. If you need prayer, &gt;&gt; there's prayer for you. Just &gt;&gt; why don't you make it personal between you and the Lord? If [music] you need deliverance, if you need freedom [singing] to the heavens, I lift my eyes where [singing] my help comes [music] from. I look to you, my rock, my [music and singing] healer. I'll trust in you. [singing] [music] Freedom [singing] is here. [music] Freedom [singing] is here. [music] [singing] Freedom [music] is here. [singing] Oh, and I receive [singing] it. [music] Freedom [singing] is here. [music] Freedom [singing] is here. [music] Freedom [singing] is here. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I believe it. [singing] I [music] reach my hands to [singing] the heavens. I lift [music] my eyes where my [singing] help comes [music] from. I'll look to you, [music] my rock, my healer. I will trust in [music and singing] you. Oo, I reach my [singing] hands [music] to the heavens. I lift my [music and singing] eyes where my help comes from. &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; I'll look to you, my rock, my [music] healer. [singing] I will trust in you, Lord. I'll trust in you. [music and singing] Oh, I'll trust in [singing] you. Oh, [music and singing] I'll trust in you, [music] Lord. [singing] I'll trust in you. Oh, [singing] salvation [music] is here.

[singing] Amen. Did you enjoy [music] that? Let's give the Lord a hand. [applause] [music] I really, really enjoyed that was evidence of salvation. The funny thing about evidence, you know, I don't know how many cases I've had in court over the years, but I never took a case into [music] court that I didn't have evidence on. Evidence is proof. &gt;&gt; It's proof that something happened. And I always wondered, you know, why why God let a mortal like John [music] go up and see the lamb on the throne, the slain lamb. It's the only human being on the face of the earth at that time that saw with his own eyes [music] the evidence that salvation had been obtained. [music] &gt;&gt; He had to come back and tell you and me there's proof. Anything that's allowed in court without evidence is considered hearsay. The judge can't look at it. The judge won't look at it cuz it's [music] hearsay. It could be a lie. And when Satan looks at your life, you look at your life. I don't know how many times I've I've had the young some young people come to me and brother Rob go to him as well. You know, want the Holy Ghost. I, you know, I feel like I got it and and then, you know, I've go through these things. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The thing about getting the Holy Ghost, the evidence of the Holy Ghost, all them battles that you were fighting before you had the Holy Ghost, they did not leave. &gt;&gt; They didn't leave. &gt;&gt; They're still there. &gt;&gt; You know, if if what what if Job is sitting on this this ash heap, he's lost everything and and and he he's the evidence of of redemption. God, brother Brandham said he had revelation. What if he never got it? [music] &gt;&gt; If he never got it, he would have rotted on that ash heap. But God gave him evidence. &gt;&gt; This is this is what God's trying to do to you tonight. &gt;&gt; Let's tell you, it's not about the battle. When when when the children of Israel crossed into the promised land, Brother Brandham said the promised land was a type of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But all them giants didn't automatically just disappear and leave. When they crossed Jordan and went to the promised land, what them giants do? They came for them. &gt;&gt; But Paul tells us in Ephesians, God gave you an armor. He gave you an armor. &gt;&gt; But the great thing about that armor, God armored you with a helmet of salvation, the shield of faith. He girded you with truth, &gt;&gt; breastplate of righteousness, and give you the sword of the spirit. [music] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Let me do the fighting." &gt;&gt; That's true evidence. When you know that you have the evidence is when you you get the Holy Ghost and all them battles still lay there in front of you. You can do like Job said, still on his ash heap. I know he is God. &gt;&gt; And he can do all things. [music] &gt;&gt; You have a God that can do all things. &gt;&gt; Your battle might be bigger tomorrow. &gt;&gt; It might be worse. but with the Holy Ghost. As our brother was saying tonight, when you go face that giant, you can face him with joy. You can face him with peace with with with with everything that comes with it, you're an heir to it. [music] &gt;&gt; But there, can we sing that song? If if not for grace, I don't know how it starts. Where would I be? Let's sing this and then we'll go. Just remember the sisters have made sandwiches and snacks next door. And uh youth, you're welcome to to come over there and fellowship. [music] Um some of the brothers, I think we're going to set up some tables. So, if you wouldn't mind helping us do that. Let's worship him a minute. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You only [singing] know. [music] I'm glad you see [singing] through eyes of love. A hopeless case, an empty [music and singing] space. If not for grace, where would [singing] I be? [music] You only know.

[music] Oh amazing [singing] grace, how [music] sweet the sound. [singing] I once was lost but [music] now I found a hopeless case [singing] in [music] deep space. If not for grace, [music] oh precious Lord, take my [singing and music] hand, lead me on and [singing] let me stand. I'm a hopeless case, [music and singing] an empty space. If not [singing] for grace, [music] oh where would I be? [singing] You only [music] know. I'm glad you [singing] see through eyes [music] of love. [music] Oh, an [singing] empty space. If [music] not for grace. Oh, [singing] where would I be? [music] You only know. I'm [singing] glad you see [music] through eyes of love. [singing] A hopeless case, an empty [music and singing] space, not for grace. [music] Oh preious Lord, [singing] take my hand. [music] Lead me on [singing] [music] and let me stand. I'm a hopeless case, [music and singing] an empty space. If not for grace, [singing and music] where would I be? [music] You only [singing] know. I'm glad you see [singing] through eyes of [music] love. A whole case, an empty [music and singing] space if not for grace.
