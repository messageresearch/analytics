that those that have been saved by the grace of God and come down Through the Ages and overcome all the things in life that they overcome We Gather on the earth and we start singing songs of redemption and the angels will circle around the earth and they'll just bow their heads because they've praised him for millions and millions of years they've blessed him they've worshiped him adored him but they really can't sing the word I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see so when we sing it they just drop their heads maybe saying things like this listen at her listen at her how his heart must be thrilled he's waited for her for all these years now she's come back home this is why we go to church this is why we pray this is why we read our Bibles this is why we do things that are right not because of fear I've not been fearful of hell for many many years when I was in pent cost I was scared of Hell terrified I lived under legalism and I so afraid my view of God was so warped and that I thought God was out to get me and he's waiting for every mistake that I made and he's with his hand back he's going to swat me and he's going to get me so you see it wasn't just this message that changed my theology about doctrines and serpent seed and stuff like that it changed my view about God 42 years ago this week I stood in Monella Kentucky March the 27th 1983 I was a Pentecostal pastor and I introduced the message of the hour to that little church that I preached 42 years ago do you have any regrets Brother D oh I've got a lot of regrets but ain't none of them because I ever come to the message cuz I love it now more than I've ever loved it and to me it doesn't make us want to make an idol out of brother brandom but it makes us so grateful that God sent him to us that he would be able to correct our view about God and about life and about each other and about so many wonderful things we're so honored that you've been with us these few days and I we still got two more two more wonderful services so we're just so thankful you enjoy the banquet last night and and the Brother David and brother Danny they're preaching and stuff we're just so thankful we'll uh just open our hearts now we'll ask brother Danny to come and whatever you have need of and remember these these meetings are are for you for your needs and your desires we can see already the Lord has addressed different things in people's lives and remember the prophet is not here to be able to say your name is so and so and you went to a doctor and he told you this and told you that but the word word is still the discerner of the intents of the heart you know it happens to you all the time at your church and we're so grateful that God has that channel that's still here today so we want to welcome our brother Danny steeman and we're just so honored for him and Brother David to come and be with us want him just to obey the Lord today God bless each of you amen amen how many love the Lord amen how many's enjoying them themselves amen we uh want to say how much uh we have enjoyed oursel and what a privilege has been for us to be here and and and be a part of that this and certainly appreciate all the efforts that have went forth um for the Youth and all the prep preparations the the banquet uh what a wonderful uh um effort it is and how beautiful it was and we certainly want to say how much we appreciated Brother David and his sermons that God gave him and how it moved our heart and I know it moved yours and I believe that there' be much fruit come forth from it I'm I'm glad to serve a God that knows us the way he does and I'm glad to serve a God that's not impersonal and he sets back with his arms crossed and say okay I I done the work of Salvation now you just go and do your own thing no he's he's here amongst us he's walking amongst us he's the same yesterday today and forever he has an active part in everything amen that you're doing amen and and his his life his whole life his whole reason and purpose of being is you amen so so we just want to express that uh in any way that we can in our own small way we want to tell you that we love you amen we we admire you we appreciate your stand for the gospel and as as already been said we live in the hardest time that there's ever been so if you feel sometimes like like we're up here condemning you or we're scolding you or we're against you we're not amen we love you and we've sat right in the same chair you've sat in and thought well man that preacher is mad at me well no he's not mad at you he is mad at the Devil maybe makes faces and everything else like that but he's not mad at you amen and so we would love to to join more with you and do things with you maybe play basketball with you and everything but just look at me I mean I I realize I I love sports growing up my daddy loves sports and and and my boys love sports and I realized my time my my arc my window was closing when my boys started not passing me the basketball amen and I realized all right it's time to go fishing so amen but uh so so we want to say that uh we want to spend time with you and we just love you with the love of the Lord and trust that not only you be encouraged in all these meetings but you'll be changed amen because God knows what you have need of some of youve come amen maybe you haven't even come to Salvation you need you need to come through repentance and baptism and baptism of the Holy Ghost God's here to give it to you God's here to give you a refreshing he's here to pull you out of wherever you're at amen we don't have any other friend like Jesus amen so let's bow our heads for a word of prayer father we love you Lord we thank you for your love that you have for the children Lord and the love that you've shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost we ask Lord that you would take these words Lord that you have given me Lord and may you get the honor for them Father may they not be mine but may they be yours Lord that may be put in their hearts Lord uh as inspiration father to to lift and to strengthen your children father you know you know them I I know hardly any of them Father but you know them so I pray that you come Lord and speak to them in a special way way we give you the glory and honor for it in Jesus name amen amen I'm want to have you turn in your Bibles to Ephesians the 2 chapter brother brandom preached a message um called the message of Grace and he took his text out of Zachariah 47 that says who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel you shall become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it that word grace in the Old Testament means favor it means acceptance this means unmar favor or Regard in God's sight in the Primitive Hebrew it means to bend down or to stoop in kindness to someone inferior I aren't you glad that he has amen so I I want you to know that without Grace we don't have a message and God certainly believes in Grace amen and and we're find here with Paul and Ephesians 2 we begin to read verse one and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time pass you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we had all our conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy amen for his great love where with he loved us how many got a Bible here raise your hand all right I want you to read that verse again with me will you but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened Us Together by Grace you are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them God bless you you can be seated may he bless the reading of his word amen in the in the New Testament here the word Grace thank you brother uh sure yeah amen appreciate it the word grace in the New Testament I'm not going to try to pronounce the Greek version of it cuz I'm not Greek amen but it it means graciousness it means especially the Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection In The Life um including gratitude acceptable benefit favor Grace gracious and joy amen you know uh as I heard brother Donnie speaking about brother brandham we love brother brandham we love amen that God Amen has sent his message through him to us amen but we also know that he did not send him to us so that we might follow him in the sense of following a man Amen brother bham said in the church age book last page he said not for one moment do I come Amen to make you followers of me he said but I come I want to see one thing and that is a true spiritual relationship established between God and man amen that is still the drive amen that is still the message amen and that is still what God is doing is to establish a true relationship so there's no wall between you and God Amen so that your perception of God is amen of not of some Earthly father who is an abuser or somebody who hates you and somebody that I got to try to please him to get his favor and and and and so we're always trying to please that man amen and that's many view many times the view of a denomination if you don't please us you're out of here amen but that's not our God God is always working in Divine favor to win your heart amen God does not want you to make a choice because you have to make a choice out of fear he wants you to make a choice because he won Your Heart by love praise the name of the Lord so then one of the uh when brother bam was preaching C is this the time or is the the is this the sign of the end sir uh 1962 and he's and he's speaking about some of the things that that the angel the seventh angel what he would uh what the Mysteries that he would he would show and and so he actually begins to read the list that that is in the scoffield Bible but then he goes beyond and he says now that's some of the mysteries of this angel that he's supposed to wind up he said but may I say this with reverence and not ref referring to myself but referring to the angel of God Amen you understand this message is not cly devised fables amen amen how the enemy is trying to make it now like it's the message of a man and so if it's a man's message you can walk away from it so easily but I want to tell you if it's not a man's message you'll never get away from it no matter how much you walk away it'll either save you or it'll haunt you praise the Lord and so amen he said now I want to say this with reverence amen that not referring to myself but referring to the angel of God the serpent seed been a hidden Mystery all through the years he said Grace straightened out not disgrace but real true Grace there's a real true Grace there's also a disgrace but there's a real true Grace amen he goes on to say about eternal secur not there's there's no Eternal burning hell and then he said that's one of the Mysteries and then he says the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did now I understand that this quote has been misused and abused all down through the years but I'm not here Amen to try to bring another version of I just want to say it how the prophet said it and bringing you into that version amen because that's the version that works amen amen what has a prophet been dealing with he has been dealing with for years because the the ministry of the angels to take all the loose ends of the battles that all of these denominational ideas amen they've been fighting over the Holy Ghost they've been fighting over Doctrine they've been fighting over hell they've been fighting over evidence of the Holy Ghost and all these things it's the ministry of the Angel to come and bring the truth the original Faith back to the people so they can believe again and be free for years denominations denominational ideas denominational characteristics amen have interfered with how the Holy Ghost moves right and we've put interpretation on it how you should act if we're not careful in the message we're put another evidence again other than what the prophet said come on Amen but I want to tell you we don't have to fear any man because no man gave it to you here's a prophet saying I didn't even give it to you it came from the angel of God hallelujah but man has always interfered and tried to tell you how you should receive it well I just want to say the way the prophet said it the evidence of the Holy Ghost is receiving the word for your age as it was in every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church if God gave you an ear he said blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears that they hear for many have desired to see the things you see and to hear the things you hearen thankk you Lord amen because not everybody has that ear God has to give it to you and if you have an ear to hear the word of God you're blessed today amen so he said it's it's Grace straightened out not disgrace brother brandom and Satan's Eden and I trust you don't mind me reading these things he said I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why didn't preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this he said here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is is a person Jesus Christ the word of God now listen established in your heart this is the desire of God this morning is to establish the word in our hearts because when the word is established in your heart it's to Quicken you to every word of this age that's why you're here amen that's the predestination the calling the election of God that's why you're here that's the part you have to play because God Amen solded the word through the prophet amen that that word was given to Faithful Men to bring out the same word I'm going to tell you God's not afraid to use men our problem in this hour is people don't trust the Holy Ghost anymore to get the job done so we got to interfere but God is Not Afraid Amen in the hands of men if the men are Holy Ghost filled amen it is still amen the Same Spirit and so God would commit just like Paul did to Timothy find Faithful Men and teach them the things that I have said amen so that they might spread the word out that's what God is looking to you to do brother brandom is not here to do the work anymore he's already sold the word but now it is your turn to rise up and take your position praise the Lord there's only one that can do it that's the Holy Ghost amen right he said said now watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstrations so now here is the the prophet of God making a difference between demonstration and action right amen he said now watch it in action what it does according to the word praise the Lord let me just stop a minute and take a drink see I'm not in the basketball game anymore in the message of Grace brother Ram said now according to the prophecy there will come The Headstone what is The Headstone headstone is amen the Fulfillment the Perfection it's the word made flesh it's when Christ comes and that's when he came I want you to notice when The Headstone comes a prince is going to cry out the message here cry Grace Grace for it's by grace are we saved not of Works lest any man should boast and the message of Grace has been tramped under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace some of them run out into eternal security some of them run into everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same that's what I'm that's the title this morning the true message of Grace and there is where Satan tries to knock it out of the church so he's going to try to knock the true message of Grace out of the church but it's the grace of God that we're all saved by I mean how many of us can understand that it's nothing you done amen that that merited you that favor but it was God stooping down to somebody who could not get up there and he stoop down to where you were oh maybe you don't understand that yet but you got to go through a process that you understand none of us are entitled but we are predestinated there's a difference entitlement thinks I deserve something but predestination is all about Grace Hallelujah now he said amen it's the grace of God we're saved by it's the deity of Jesus Christ if the Lord could come here come there and confirm that this is the truth not only that but by his word he confirms it's a truth and by signs and wonders he confirms it's a truth then also Grace is the truth you understand then why would anybody criticize and say grace is wrong that were saved by works you see this was the problem in Galatians they was trying to go backwards they was trying to to bring in circumcision again upon the upon the Gentiles and say you got to observe the law of Moses in order in other words you got to become a Jew and then become a Christian amen and Paul would write those words even though I are even an angel from heaven say anything different than what I have already preached see there's the action let him be a cursed you see it has to be by the original word God's not interested in our thought he's interested in our life praise the Lord he said now why would anybody uh criticize that we're saved by grace and and that we're and that and and say grace is wrong we're Saved By Word we are saved by grace through faith not works works shows you've been saved you see there's an outworking of Grace in our life but what saves you is the grace of God grace saves you Grace is what God does for you works is what you do for God you see the Gratitude of Grace to so appreciation of what God did for you but by Grace you're saved this is a little lengthy but just bear some people think because I joined the church put my name on the book that's all I have to do some people think because I shout that's all I have to do others think I speak in tongues that's all I have to do some thinks because I got power to heal the sick that's all I have to do but it's not it's the grace of God that saves you God's Amazing Grace so in other words he said you could do all those things and not have Grace right he said uh I cannot trust in any Merit some say well there's a great man that man I heard him stand up and do this I heard him stand up and do that Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13 though I speak with tongue of men and angels and though I have discernment and though I have gifts to feed I'll take all my goods to feed the poor and though I can move mountains with faith and though I have knowledge to understand all things I am nothing till love comes in which is Grace God has to do it you can do all those things and be lost it's Grace that saves you his grace to the human race amen Jude would say amen I write you beloved to give all diligence amen of the common salvation it was needful for me to write you and exhort you you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men watch turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our savior so that's the enemy's attempt he's always always going to attempt to take Grace out of your life because if you lose sight of what Grace is there's no more outworking of Grace in your life amen and your witness becomes stale and it becomes no good because amen we cannot carry this message oursel it must be the spirit in us that will carry that message amen if the Spirit Carries the message it'll give the true interpretation amen of what amen the characteristic of what he wants you to see amen I and I I and I love these things the prophet says about Grace and I'm trying to lay a foundation and obviously it's a big one amen we won't try we won't hold you long hopefully maybe amen here's another thing about Grace Grace is Sovereign do you know what Sovereign means Sovereign means one that exercise Supreme permanent auth [Music] Authority so if Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign one it what can it do Sovereign can do whatever it wants amen it can do whatever it wants amen Sovereign Grace can only be given by one that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody amen isn't that wonderful I don't have to it doesn't have to ask can I do this or shall I do this or can I or must I or will I it does it itself Grace is Sovereign therefore he can save the vest he can save the most immoral he can save the most impure now now I'm coming down now he's scooping down to our level he knows where we've been he knows what we've done he knows our battles you may be condemned but he's not here to condemn you he's here to convict you back to the grace of God it's not time to give up it's time to get up amen amen Grace is not just when he takes you out of the dirt no but Grace is what we live by Grace is what carries us Grace is what finishes it it's all the grace of God Amen you know uh Paul he's telling Timothy Timothy's a young man you're familiar with the scriptures amen let no man ah all right there goes they can't pass me the ball again I just lost that scripture amen huh let no man despise I you thank you and he's older than me amen amen let no man despise thy youth you know what Paul is doing now Paul Paul had a established the Ephesian Church on the word of God the whole book of Ephesians a wonderful book amen parallels Joshua amen it's the crossing over it's the placing of God's people in their position in Christ and and now it's it's a wonderful book but a year after that he's already telling Timothy they're already coming in preaching something else come on and I can't get back there but you're going to have to do it and over 25 times in the book of 1 Timothy and second Timothy he encourages Timothy in some way to be strong to stir up the gift of God let no man despise thy Youth and he tells him be strong in the grace of God Don't Be Afraid Amen to tell these men amen they've been swerved aside by Vain jangling and genealogies and all these false sciences and everything else and they've got caught up away from the original word Don't Be Afraid preach the truth the truth will fight the [Applause] battle amen so that word be strong it means to empower or to increase in strength you're going into a situation it's not going to take it from you it's going to increase God actually causes trials if you now trials can destroy a person but a child of God amen he has that Channel with God Amen that as he goes through trials he actually gets stronger not [Applause] weaker stronger not weaker not in himself in Grace right so much grace is even for unanswered prayers Grace is an answer to unanswered prayers if you can receive it his grace is sufficient Paul said I was buffeted by a messenger of the devil and he said I besought the Lord three times to take this from me now he had just got done talking about all the revelations he had and where he had been the Realms he had been into I knew a man but he then begins to say but I've been buffeted and I've and so now here's a man who has such access and yet God won't answer his prayer to be delivered from this messenger the way he wants it to be how many times if we prayed and it didn't go the way we prayed but it didn't mean it was a lack of faith and it didn't mean that God didn't answer but Grace will give you knowledge and so he's he's there and he said I besought the Lord three times and he said that it depart from me and he said to me my grace is sufficient for thee you know what suff sufficient means it means to be possessed of unfailing strength the sufficiency of God is unfailing strength the sufficiency of God even means to be satisfied how can we be satisfied When God says no but God causes us to be satisfied because we know it's what he wants amen sufficiency my grace is sufficient means it's a strong wall Lord I have put my grace around you and Paul you're still I it's I'm going to allow that Messenger to come and Buffet you but you remember that your infirmities I rest amen I come to your weakness you see young people we're not careful we begin to think God despises young uh not young he despises weak people that we should only we interpret what we think strong faith looks like and we think strong faith is a force field around us that trouble can't get through and that's a lie faith is trusting God because God has to have a witness in every situation he had a job and it's God's prerogative whatever we go through it's God's prerogative he may commit you to death he may commit you to trouble like job he may commit you to some kind of trial but he trusts you to go through it and give God the glory in everything you're going through amen we're not here to be disappointed in our father we're here to give glory to his name praise the Lord them are the good works of God so Paul would preach Grace in Ephesians and he would mention it 12 times the word Grace speak of it over and over and over Amen brother bam said in the Masterpiece he said now watch every Masterpiece is put on a foundation amen and he talked about Michel uh Michelangelo's Monument of Moses he say it's on a three or four foot piece of marble it's got a foundation he said God when he prepared this masterpiece he would take pat he took the Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph and he and he made a foundation and we know that Abraham amen amen amen is Faith and then we know that Isaac is love and then we know Jacob is Grace brother bam said anybody read the life of Jacob has to believe in grace that's who I'm G to talk about here for a moment and then he said Joseph who is perfection so you notice amen Faith brings forth love love brings forth Grace love and grace brother bam said are sisters you cannot have one without the other love and grace have to go together so if you really love somebody amen it is not a narcissistic love that I only love you if you Pat me on the back no amen the love of God love and Grace has to go together amen there's a lie being told Amen in our age amen that if you really love me you're bear with me I'm going to tell you real love amen agape love is not allowing you to do whatever you want but real agapy love comes to the need amen if I wanted to be like you I say I love you do whatever you want I want to be like you then I got to become friends with what you're doing ien I don't become friends with what you're doing but if I have agape love amen I can speak to the need that's real love amen real love that can lift us up why because agape love had to speak to me amen so here's this foundation and brother B said that God put amen he begin to he began to build the body off of that Perfection so you have love you have faith love grace and grace brings forth Perfection amen every one of them you can find Jesus Christ in every one of these life is this something that all these Patriarchs not one of them had a Bible none of them had 12200 messages 13 million commentaries none of them had amen YouTube to access and see what somebody's opinion on it amen nobody could go to the bishop Google and find out what do you that really mean nobody could use AI they had none of it but God took their life and he gave them a word and then he'd begin to build through that life because that life was going to be the foundation right see it's a life it's a person it's a life right amen and he begin to built through it in Abraham amen we can see all the works that God done through him amen the faith of Abraham the altars he built amen you can see amen the love of God in that you could see the type of Christ there Amen in Abraham the life of a man the stages of the church in the life of Abraham you could see the first coming you could see the second coming in the life of Abraham you saw Calvary How could a man live like that he didn't know cuz he didn't have nothing to go by he just followed God yes and God said I can use that then he had a son his name was Isaac Isaac amen there's only a few chapters of him amen but in that amen we see a type of the bride and Jesus Christ and his love for her and how he come and got somebody who is like him same blood amen came from the same country come on church amen that's my God God could take a life and show me there that by faith this morning I can look back all the way to men who don't have the Bible and see myself in the Bible and then it brought forth of Jacob now Jacob is just a mama's boy how many Mama's Boys we got here today when that takes guts praise the Lord for guts amen I like that well I guess I am too we're just joined forces now I I want you to see that always the message is always the word made flesh so to backtrack just a little bit so you had Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and then he built upon that the prophets the body is formed by the prophets not formed by the law it's formed by the prophets and then out of the prophets come Jesus Christ The Headstone true amen when he come amen John wrote the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth that's why his Doctrine was different John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he who whom I spake he that come after me is preferred before me because he was before me and of his fullness have we all received and Grace for Grace look what happens when it comes to the Stone and the words made flesh and then it's Grace for Grace Grace just keeps coming out just keeps giving so now we come to Jacob Jacob is raised in a message home and he's twins we know how the prophet used Esau and Jacob as twins to describe the the the true church and the false church and how close they are I remember uh uh brother Homer Brown you remember brother Homer Brown and he's my wife's grandfather and and and and I have I have twins as well and when they were small uh he called me up and he goes hey brother Danny he goes um uh I'm preaching on twins at the church and I'd like you to send me pictures of your boys and I said nope amen cuz you're not going to use my boys my twins as example of biblical twins so he laughed he said he he understood because my boys are not Esau and Jacob all right they're both Jacob and Jacob anyway that's just what I have to say as my right as a father say nope you're not going to use them like that sorry brother Homer I know you've went on to be with the Lord and I love you and amen but I thank you for doing that full of grace and truth now amen Paul wrote about them he said the children Esau and Jacob being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election my stand not of works but of him that calleth calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger so now Jacob is raised in a message home it has the word of God present Truth for their day given to the parents the Elder Shall Serve the younger that was the word and God's going to bring it to pass I don't know how he's going to bring it to pass but he said said he would right so it's not my job to give God my opinion on how it should work I have to step back and let him do it because if I manufacture it I've now stepped into the permissive will of God and not the perfect will he always make the permissive will amen for his glory but the permissive will has a lot of damage oh yes a lot of hurt even a lot of death a lot of division but God will make it work for his glory in other words he'll still bring it all the way around and make it happen the way he said but it may delay it so now here's Jacob and here's Esau two boys and those two boys cause a division in the family now Isaac's a prophet but it caused a division in the family because Jacob was mama's favorite and Esau was daddy's favorite and Esau's a prophet Esau knows what God has said I'm sorry J uh Isaac knows what God has said right but because Isa uh because Esau is the firstborn amen the blessing is for him and the birthright blessing is for him the the abrahamic blessing amen the the blessing from Eden the serpent Bruiser is to go through the firstborn it was all to go through that but God had said the Elder Shall Serve the younger how's that going to happen how's the birthright going to fall upon this man when we already got division in the Church of Isaac and and now they get older and you know as time gets near for fulfillment we start becoming impatient right we start starting p Bush and came time that Rebecca heard Isaac tell Esau go make that venison that I like and when you come back we'll eat it and I'm going to give you the blessing Rebecca heard it so she came and told Jacob said Jacob your brother's going out to the field to get some meat he said we've got to do something to get this blessing she goes I tell you what I've got some of your brother's clothes and I know how to make the food the way he does so now you let me make this meal and I'll dress you in Esau's clothes you have to pretend you're Esau and you'll get the blessing now there is how the church got involved the Holy Ghost without sensation because she is producing a sensation that looks like someone else and God does not want you to look or smell like anybody [Applause] else now I could wear these brothers coats and I could act like them and you could think woo he's got it can you imagine if I preach like Brother David I'd been to the hospital twice already I'd be the chiropractor I'm jerk himself around I admire that man he's like a cat you know I I you see what Ian are I preach like brother Donnie no way but if I wore his coat and his cologne you have cologne on brother yeah okay I'm not going to ask you what kind I'm a little afraid and and then she takes the church hands him this bowl of meat and the church says here's your brother's clothes now you got it and you know Isaac is old and he's blind amen and he's like he hears Jacob talking so he's confused and he goes well you sound like you sound like Jacob but you smell like Esau come come here I'm G to come here come here okay I'm going to really get him now hug me hug me oh yes this is definitely Esau definitely Esau all right amen and then he put the blessing on him and Jacob stole the blessing now something had happened a while back and what happened was Esau had sold his Birthright for a bowl of pottage because he was so hungry amen and there was something in Jacob that desired he wasn't a good person he was he was a deceiver that's what supper is amen or Jacob means a supper he's a deceiver and I want to tell you I don't care if you said in a message church if you sow to the flesh you're going to reap corruption but if you sow to the spirit of God you're going to reap amen what is put in there is that true amen so here is a man trying to be what the church is telling him to be but it's not what God Said right it's what she said right I want to tell you amen you're not here to put a coat of a Church on you're not here to put the cat of your favorite preacher on come on Church you're not here to say what church you attend because I want to tell you something I got news for every one of you there is not one Church in this message taking a Rapture it is individuals it is individuals that have a relationship with God them are the ones taking a Rapture amen my church is not taking a Rapture it's the people out of it so your church cannot save you that's there's no man can intervene for you but weep not John for the line of the tribe of Judah he has prevailed no Prophet no man no Priest No Pope Jesus [Applause] Christ and if you're in him you can no more die than he can die you can't go to hell cuz he already went to hell Hallelujah destined for amen a body change ca he already amen paid the price bought you with the price you're not your own so then why would I settle for my brother's coat but he got his he got the blessing from Daddy and just after he left here comes his brother in Esau's coat and now it was Esau with his meat the Bible says Isaac trembled CU now he realized I've given the blessing away and I can't get it back that's what Paul was referring to when Esau sought it with tears but there was no place for him because he counted as a common he counted the birthright as common in other words when he went and sold his Birthright for the bow of poage the temporary was more important to him than the the Eternal and he saw no value because the birthright is actually spiritual not just natural things and so he put the value in the natural let me tell you young people you put all the value of God into the natural things you're going to miss it if you put it only in just a career and how how well you're doing and you start losing interest in coming here and you start mixing up and other things that's not the birthright you might say oh hey let me tell you I know it's God he opened the door don't you know the devil knows how to turn doors OBS he knows how to open doors because of that door takes you out of church takes you out of Fellowship that wasn't God that opened the [Applause] door Hallelujah so what did the birthright for Jacob produce at that time Esau came out of that meeting with his daddy so angry he said the time of my daddy's morning is coming and when he's dead I'm going to kill him so the church found out about it it's kind of like what we do he we find out about a problem let's just send them away get them out of here I want tell you what tell you what this cost Jacob it cost him this is the last time he's going to see his mother he's being sent away and his father told him his father told him you go down uh to laan your mother's brother go down there take a wife from somebody from there from of our own blood but you're going to have to get out of here now he's going to be gone for 20 years 20 years but he got the birthright from his brother by deceit and I want you to notice when Esau sold his Birthright his name changed to Edom he became known for what he gave it up for you want to start a YouTube channel against this message that's the only thing you'll be known for you want to try to use your Instagram to try to pull children out of the church that's all you're being known for hello Edom that's all you want to do that's good now you're going to try to kill your brother but you're the one that gave it up you're the one didn't think the message meant anything yes sir you saw no value in it but here's a boy he's not even born again but there's something down in his heart said I got to have it I got to have it and I trust there somebody like that in here I got to have it [Applause] so off goes Jacob he's running and he comes to bethl the Bible says he goes down there and he lays down takes stones of the place and he lays his head down on it and he goes to sleep now according to the Bible bethl is where his grandfather Abraham had been true and built altars but to this young man he wasn't building ERS he was sleeping he was using the stones of the place to sleep and he didn't know God was there maybe I'm speaking to a Jacob right now don't know God's right here in this room right now but as he's sleeping the angel of the Lord appears to him now we're talking Grace right and he began to and he saw a ladder going to heaven and angels ascending and decending the Lord spoke to him appeared to him and said I will not leave you until I have performed the word that I said to Abraham and to Isaac he was just on the Run he didn't even know know God was in that place and the angel of the Lord was right there with him right you see God called you you may not even know it yet but when he appeared and he saw this Vision he woke up and he's afraid he said God was in this place I didn't even know it brother Bram said he said God was showing him Jacob's Latter was Grace and he said it was hooked he hooked it he hooked it to the throne and anchored it in Jesus Christ and put you in the middle he said there's no way you can be miss it wait a minute it's hooked to the throne amen Anchored In Jesus and I'm here amen so if I go back down he's still there and if I go up I'm getting closer oh it's Grace here's Jacob now he's going to run he goes he goes into to laan's territory and as it is with many amen he falls in love amen but the thing of it is he had slded to the Flesh and he met his match in laan so now you have two deceitful businessmen in the same family you imagine I'd like to have laan and Jacob said here as businessmen not as changed yet and let them stand up and give their testimony how they tried to keep cheating one another can I have your daughter yeah you can have her then he gave her another one I mean what would you no wait a minute no I'm let's not even go there what would you do amen he married n he gave him his oldest y Leah and then he said all right you're going to have to work for this other one seven more years man he was getting everything out of Jacob he could he was janum dry and that man was talented he knew how to cut a deal he was a Donald Trump of Genesis I mean know he was better than Donald Trump you got it I mean I mean he was bigly back there amen so amen so he's just draining him everything he can Jacob has been in a season of this weakness for 20 years down there now he's got got two wives he's got children and things are he's he's wanting to get out of there because he's being ripped off so many times and he's like I I just want to get out of here and so they cut a deal I I could read it to you but for the sake of time it want and he went to to to Laban and he said listen uh if I could uh uh you know they they had their talk about wages and they complained and they fought about it and you said you've wed I've been here 20 years done this that and the other weighs my rages 10 times whatever more and so they're fighting and and so forth and he said he said if I could just have the I believe is a speckled and so forth the of the stock and everything and so laan says all right you can do that's a good deal but then he went and told his son said hey go pull them all out all the ones he wants get them out but they was great for one another I hope we don't have anybody in here like that you know and uh so his life is a mess his life is a mess but God had never left him in all of those messes the angel of the Lord actually appeared to him said I've seen all that laan has done for you and done to you I've seen all that Laban has done to you and he told him what to do and how take and so he he actually became very wealthy from the Angel's advice and when he done that it caused division again now here comes division because now he's ripping off the family and God is using trouble to drive him back home maybe I speak to a young person that's in trouble right now you know there's a there's a painting and I know it's been embellished on and and and locations changed and everything but the painting is of of the the devil and a young man playing a game of chess and it's called The Game of Life Checkmate and I I did research on it tried to find out where it came from because you know people have moved it all the way over to the lou and everything else but I found out it happened right here in the states 1888 there was an article written and it was about uh the chess champion a man by the name of Paul morphe and it was during the time of the Civil War and they' they'd have a chess club and they'd all come together these Champions would come together and play play chess and everything and so this Reverend had invited this chess champion over to his house and these Champions are there and and uh they're they're eating and and he looks up and he sees this picture of of the devil playing chess with this young man and and uh and it's called Checkmate and what it is is the devil's pieces are vices and the young man's pieces are virtues and every move the devil was making was taking a virtue from that young man and the painting has the young man down to no more moves he's there with his head in his hands the game is over it's called Checkmate and so this this champion this this Paul morphe he's he's uh he's eating food and he's looking at that and he just keeps looking at he gets done eating he goes over and he stands in front of that and he looks at it for a while and then he turns to the rever he said I believe I can take this young man's game and win and they said there's no way he's come down there's no more moves he said but I see Mo I see that I can win the game he said set the pieces up exactly how it is right there in the picture and so champion after Champion came and played chess with him on that move and every man was defeated by this Champion that when the young man thought it was all over and all the vices has ruined his life and his virtues are taken away a champion looked at his life and said you know what I can take that young man's game and I can win the game of life amen that's the Jacob that I'm talking about let me tell you something Jacob it's not over for you the angel of the Lord is still with you and he can take it even if your virtues are gone he can still win the game of Life blessed be the name of the Lord I look around the room and I believe the holy spirit is seeing some more young people I can take your game amen yes virtues might have been taken from you but I can take your game and I can still win why I'm the Champion am that's right oh come on somebody we got a God owns a cattle on a thousand hills his grace is greater his love is stronger you don't understand it but my God loves you that kind of Grace is what I need Angel of the Lord told him it's time to go back home go back to bethl where you first saw Grace go back so he left secretly amen laan laban's Sons heard about it and they chased him and they called him why'd you leave and you know the the story you know how they talked and everything young people I'm coming down to the end and I just what I want to tell you when he finally released him when Laban released him do you know Jacob still does not truly have the birthright he has the knowledge he has the Heritage he even has visions and he has visitation but he hadn't been changed you know why he hadn't been changed he hadn't left the past behind and he hadn't made it right no no matter he say well I got the birth right but he done his brother wrong so all this trouble between Jacob and lean they came to an agreement they said we're going to build a pillar right here it's going to be a pillar of witness for our agreement we're not trouble one another anymore and here's what this means when we build this that means I will never cross over over that and you will never cross over that yourself in other words you will never go back there's a lot of people sitting churches but they're always talking about what's happened come on come on come on always talking about the past always like you're a victim or something all right how can anybody stand in the presence of the Lord I'm not saying something hadn't happened to you and you had went through abuse or any kind of trouble it's not what I'm saying but how can anybody stand in the presence of the Lord and say I'm a victim when the unsearchable riches of his grace is poured out upon us and he's followed you even through all the trouble you've been he's followed you and he's called at your heart and now he's brought you to a place it's time to come home it's time to come home but if you're going to go home you can't ever go back and you got to tell God I'm never going back oh I wonder if we have any young people in here like that I'm never going back I'm going to I'm going to build a pillar of witness right here in this church right now I'm not going back to bitterness I'm not going back to memory I'm not going back to defeat I'm not going back where he took me amen I'm going all the way Hallelujah and in when he done that it was then he came to the place that the angel of the Lord met him right and he wrestled and there his name was changed from Jacob to a prince with God I'm no more a deceiver but he had to make that decision I won't go back what season you in young people are you sleeping not real realizing God is in this place are you living in a place in a season right now where you're blaming everybody around you for what's being taken from you are you willing to build a pillar say I'm never going to go back yes Lord cuz we got a champion standing here and it's not me it's not any of these preachers got a champion here right now knows your life and he's looking at it and you gave up and he said I can take your life and win my Lord is a champion of champions he went to a well one time there's a woman married to five has another that's which she's not is not her own amen and she and Jesus begins to talk to her bring me a drink amen it's not you know it's not customed to do this amen I'm a Samaritan you're a Jew and he begins to talk and he said well go get your husband he knew exactly he was studying her picture go get your husband well I've had five well she said I'm I I don't have a husband he says you've had five and the one you're with is not your own and then she realized she's not in the presence of a normal person she's in the presence of a champion and he's looking at her life and he says now bring it to me we're going to build a pillar right here we're going to build a pillar and you're never going to go back to what you was I'm not going to give you Grace that you can go live any way you want to but my grace amen takes the desire from you Amen to go back and live that kind of life that's my God that's my Champion he looked at her life there's a woman laying on the ground caught in the very Act of adultery and the church looked at her and said this should be stoned there's no more moves brother no more moves but my Champion looked at the picture he said I can believe I can do something with her I believe she follow me see it's not where you've been it's who you are right amen and the Champions here to say I can take your game and win let's stand praise the name of the Lord you might know this chorus and I love it I'll sing it for you and if you know it you sing it with me he has for forgiv me my sins have been washed from his meory by the blood of the Lamb of calary he has for G me I know he has forgiv me for my sins have been washed from his meory by the blood of the Lamb of Cal for I know he has forgive me I wonder with our heads bowed is there any young person here that you're in the game of life amen and you think everything has been finished for you but the Holy Spirit has spoken to your heart this morning and you want to lift your hand you can come you can come for prayer the altar is open whatever it is but if it's just lifting your hand to say God God I want you to take my life and make out of it what you can I want you to do that father you see all these hands Lord You've spoken to their hearts maybe we've been guilty Lord of trying to put on someone else's coat and to try to please someone else maybe we just tried to please our church maybe we've pretended and we've acted but God you want that relationship with us where it's you and them there's no man between you and them amen there's nothing else it's the true demonstration in life of the Holy Ghost living in them Father if they haven't come to that place amen may they seek it with all their hearts may they hunger and thirst after righteousness for you said there be filled Lord amen this age is an age of entitlement where we just sit back and say try to please me try to entertain me do something for me but Lord amen you want us to be zealous to repent and to follow you to seek you with all our hearts you said you would be found of us Lord I pray you touch the hands only as you know how and take their life because you're the champion and make of it what you promised and we'll say it's Grace Grace Amazing Grace in Jesus name amen God bless you amen amen [Music] amazing grace shall always be my song can we sing it before we come to a close for it was Grace that b my [Music] Liberty I do not know just why he came to love me so he L beond can we sing it together to him my fault is so I KN everybody with all your heart I shall for lift my eyes to C to view the cross where Jesus died for me thank you Lord thank you Lord the grace that caught my falling Soul he looked beond praise the Lord can we sing the chorus once more brother Joe everybody oh I [Music] shout my eyes to the Cross where Jesus for me how the [Music] great thank you [Music] Lord [Music] amen so so grateful for God's grace I couldn't help but thinking when brother Danny was preaching brother Brandon preached a message I think it was in ' 63 and he titled a message called Grace brother Brandon was telling the people he said I'm going to explain grace to you in the best way I know possible it began to tell a story of of a king that had a rich he was a rich man he was a king and he had a son he started to tell how how some man murdered his son violently and there was this big Manhunt this man they went out and they found this man they passed sentence on him and they they put him in a sail and got ready to execute him the king said I want to go down there and talk to him I want to find out why he killed my son so he said the King goes down there and he walks into the sail and this this man is he's skinny his eyes are are sunk back in his head his face is all drawn in he's wearing nothing but a loin cloth and the King ask him says why did you kill my son why would you do such a violent thing what did did my son do anything to you and he said no sir he said he did nothing I was jealous of him and and and I'm crying not because I'm going to be executed but I'm I'm crying because I did such a violent act and brother brandom said that the king looked on him and said bring my robe put it on him destroy the records and he said a big limousine pulled up outside and the the king took the man out of the cell and put him in the limousine and took him to his his house to live with him and he became his son he said that was me and you in that cell because we killed his son and we look at we that that's God's grace and a lot of you are dealing with things in your life and you you many times you you might wake up in the middle of the night and say Lord why am I going through this if he showed that much grace to you that he would clothe you in his own garments what makes you think he wouldn't give you Grace for the little bitty thing that you're going through right now our problem is when we walked into his house with his robe on we we look in the mirror and we still see ourself we still see the the person that was laying in the cell but when Grace walks in the room he sees the Son and Daughter of a king than you so if you can trust God God will never bring you out of of where you were in sin and let you go through something and not help you through it he's not that kind of
