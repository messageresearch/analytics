[11:06] I believe we could all say that tonight,
[11:08] couldn't we? Ain't it good to be in
[11:09] church? Look at your neighbor and tell
[11:11] them you're glad to see him
[11:13] tonight. Now, tell them the truth. If

[11:16] really glad to see him. Praise the Lord.
[11:19] So glad to have each and every one of
[11:20] you here tonight. So glad that God has
[11:23] let us enter into his sanctuary once
[11:26] again to worship him in spirit and
[11:29] truth. How many of you enjoyed service
[11:30] here on Sunday morning? I tell you what,
[11:32] the the presence of the Lord is just so
[11:35] wonderful and we're grateful for that
[11:37] tonight. We don't want to ever take that
[11:39] for granted because that's precious, his
[11:42] presence among us. We're so glad to have
[11:44] any of you tonight that is visiting with
[11:46] us. We want to say we welcome you. Glad
[11:49] to have you here. All of our streamers
[11:51] locally and around the world, we want to
[11:53] say God bless every one of those folks.
[11:56] Could we give all these people a good
[11:57] hand tonight if you
[12:01] will? Praise the Lord. Brother Mike
[12:04] Walls is visiting with us tonight. I saw
[12:06] him come in. I want him if he will to
[12:08] get ready to pray over our prayer
[12:10] request tonight. Brother Mike, if you
[12:12] would. So, we just want to say once
[12:14] again, we're glad to have you. Have some
[12:16] folks visiting with us tonight. Gideon,

[12:22] close to it. And family, they're
[12:24] visiting from New Zealand. Where would
[12:26] you be? Raise your hand right back here.
[12:28] Give those folks a real good hand
[12:30] tonight. God bless you.
[12:33] So glad to have you with us. Brother
[12:35] Keith Phillips turns in a urgent
[12:37] unspoken prayer request. The Lord knows
[12:39] all about that need tonight. And then on
[12:41] a sad note, Lynn Duggar Jr., Brother
[12:44] Lynn Duggar, Senior, was here in the
[12:46] service with us on this past Sunday.
[12:48] First time he's got to be with us in a

[12:54] believe, on yesterday. And uh this the
[12:58] visitation will be Saturday from 12 to 4
[13:01] at Pleasant Beach Baptist Church over in
[13:04] Elizabeth and service will uh be at 4:00

[13:30] Sister Barbara and Brother Bert Grley.

[14:27] remember him in prayer as he recovers
[14:29] from open heart surgery that took place

[14:36] Benjamin tonight as we pray that the
[14:38] Lord would be mindful of him. Sister
[14:40] Ruth Louise Jax is requesting prayer for
[14:43] her and her family. She is seeking God's
[14:45] perfect will concerning where she should
[14:47] move uh due to her health situations and
[14:52] alos as well and also for her family. So
[14:56] we want to remember those needs tonight
[14:58] as we pray that the Lord would be
[15:00] mindful of that situation. God is
[15:03] certainly concerned about our needs,
[15:05] isn't he? Amen. I want to remember

[15:35] We just want to commit all these things
[15:37] unto the Lord. Let's stand together if

[16:50] [Music]
[16:51] Thank you,
[16:54] Lord. Let's just pray together. Father,
[16:56] as we look to you this
[16:59] evening, without you being
[17:01] here, it would be useless to join
[17:04] together.
[17:05] But how great thou art that you would
[17:08] look at each one of these chosen vessels
[17:10] that's in this building tonight and
[17:12] those who are streaming the service,
[17:14] Lord. And we all are different in our
[17:17] different ways. But you knew all about
[17:20] each one of us. And Lord, as I hold in
[17:22] my hands just so many different needs,
[17:26] the loss of a loved one, it's so
[17:27] painful. Lord, when we lose them in this
[17:29] life, but if their heart was right with
[17:32] you and their desire was to serve you,
[17:34] Lord, we have this confidence. We have
[17:36] this hope that we'll meet them again on
[17:38] the other side. We'll meet them one day,
[17:39] Lord, in the air. Father, these needs of
[17:42] the different ones that are sick and
[17:44] going to the hospital and can't be in
[17:46] church tonight. You see all these needs
[17:49] and how that they're suffering, but the
[17:51] authority of your word has come. You
[17:53] said by his stripes, we're healed. And
[17:55] Lord, we're so thankful tonight that
[17:57] you've done that just for us. Walk with
[17:59] us, Lord, through this service. Help us
[18:01] to honor you in all things so that when
[18:03] we ask you, you're readily available to
[18:06] come because we've got our lives in line
[18:08] with your word and you said, "That's my
[18:10] child and I want to take care of the
[18:11] situation. May you bless each one that's
[18:13] asked for help tonight. May you minister
[18:15] through the word tonight and bless our
[18:17] hearts." We pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[18:20] Amen. Thank you, brother. God bless you,
[18:22] brother. Appreciate Brother Michael
[18:24] Walls on. We give him a nice hand
[18:25] tonight.

[18:34] offering. Let me make just a couple more
[18:36] announcements. Trustee meeting tonight

[18:41] small ring has been found in the
[18:42] sanctuary. If it if it belongs to you,

[19:01] please contact Brother Michael, they
[19:03] would be needed starting next week and
[19:05] continuing until the vacation Bible
[19:08] school ends on Friday, June the 6. So,
[19:10] if you have a canopy, you'd be willing
[19:12] to let the the let them use during Bible
[19:16] Bible school. I'm certainly uh I know
[19:19] they'd appreciate that. So, uh remember
[19:21] that announcement tonight. Let's sing a

[31:41] bear. Whisper peace when your world gets
[31:45] shattered.

[39:25] [Music]
[39:27] alone. Oh
[39:29] Lord, I
[39:33] believe. Oh
[39:36] Lord, I
[39:40] believe that all
[39:43] things are
[39:46] possible if
[39:48] only we believe.
[39:53] Oh
[39:54] Lord, we
[39:58] believe. Oh
[40:00] Lord, we
[40:04] believe that all
[40:07] things are

[40:13] we believe. Y'all sing that to him now
[40:16] with all your hearts.
[40:18] Oh
[40:19] Lord, I
[40:23] believe. Oh
[40:25] Lord, I
[40:29] believe that all
[40:32] things are
[40:35] possible. Lord,
[40:38] I believe.
[40:42] Oh
[40:44] Lord, I
[40:47] believe. Oh
[40:50] Lord, I
[40:53] believe that all
[40:56] things are
[40:59] possible. For Lord,
[41:03] I
[41:07] believe. And we're standing on your
[41:10] promise.
[41:12] It's the foundation of your
[41:16] word where everyone is
[41:19] here who believes on you,
[41:25] Lord. We're leaning on your
[41:29] power. You'll do what can't be done.
[41:34] It's either now or
[41:36] forever, but we know it's going to
[41:40] [Music]
[41:45] [Applause]
[41:54] come. Praise the
[41:56] Lord. Amen.
[41:59] Thank you, brother Tim. That's awesome.
[42:02] What a privilege it is to believe.
[42:06] Amen. Just to be able to
[42:09] believe. Let's turn to Genesis 24
[42:12] tonight if you would. Verse
[42:15] 21. Question answers tomorrow night.
[42:18] 7:00. We're good for that, brother
[42:22] Robin. Genesis 24:21.
[42:26] the model
[42:29] servant sent on a
[42:31] mission. And the man wondering at her
[42:34] held his peace to wit whether the Lord
[42:37] had made his journey prosperous or not.
[42:42] And it came to pass as the camels had
[42:44] done
[42:45] drinking that the man took a golden
[42:48] earring of half a shekele weight and two
[42:52] bracelets for her hands of 10 shekels
[42:55] weight of gold. Now let me enlighten you
[43:00] a little
[43:01] bit. and bestowing the jewelry on her
[43:07] hands. Eleazar is
[43:10] claiming
[43:12] Rebecca for
[43:14] Isaac and accepting the
[43:17] jewelry. She
[43:20] allowed this
[43:22] stranger to touch
[43:26] her which is not
[43:28] customary especially not a
[43:31] stranger. So in order to put this
[43:34] bracelet on her hand she allowed him to
[43:38] touch her
[43:40] hand and
[43:42] also her face.
[43:46] He's making a move and she is
[43:50] responding by her allowing him instead
[43:53] of hitting him, drawing back her hand.
[43:56] Don't do that. It's not
[43:58] customary. But she forfeited her
[44:04] rights. Now, she knew what she was
[44:06] doing. To us westerners, makes no sense
[44:09] whatsoever. But to them, you did not do
[44:13] that.
[44:14] A man didn't go around putting his arm
[44:16] around a woman. You didn't touch a
[44:18] woman. You get your head removed from
[44:23] your
[44:24] shoulders. Unlike today where they live
[44:27] so
[44:28] filthy. Praise the Lord.
[44:31] So whenever she sees this and he pulls
[44:34] it out of his
[44:36] bag, she knows, "Oh my
[44:40] lord, this this
[44:42] this is the beginning of
[44:48] engagement and said, "Whose daughter art
[44:51] thou? Tell me, I pray thee, is there
[44:53] room in thy father's house for us to
[44:56] lodge in?" And she said unto him, "I am
[44:58] the daughter of Bethule, the son of
[45:01] Mila, which she bare unto Nahor." Let me
[45:05] point out to you again. Now, she's not
[45:07] just pointing to her father's side, but
[45:10] to her mother's side, which is very
[45:12] unusual for the Old
[45:15] Testament. She said, "Moreover, unto him
[45:18] we have both straw and proender enough
[45:21] and room to lodge in." and the man bowed
[45:26] down his head and worshiped the Lord. I
[45:31] may like to be remembered tonight as we
[45:32] pray and ask God's blessings on the
[45:35] word. Lord Jesus, as we stand once again
[45:39] tonight in your presence,
[45:42] Father, we are so grateful for the
[45:44] opportunity that's been given to us as
[45:47] your children.
[45:50] We believe that this same
[45:55] incident is occurring spiritually in the
[45:59] hour that we live.
[46:01] Father, we believe that you have sent a
[46:05] model servant with a message. Now, he's
[46:09] been gone physically from us as we know
[46:12] for many, many years. But this message
[46:16] is still going on. And for that we are
[46:21] grateful. We believe then the gospel of
[46:25] the Lord Jesus revealed in the light of
[46:28] this evening time is still searching out
[46:32] a bride. And that bride will come to you
[46:37] with total
[46:39] submission. She will stand
[46:42] still. She will be clothed a certain
[46:45] way.
[46:46] These ornaments that
[46:50] Eleaser placed upon Rebecca were not
[46:54] hers. They were actually from
[46:58] Isaac. So it was a moar which was a
[47:03] price, a gift to the bride. So she
[47:08] received these gifts from the messenger
[47:12] and then they became hers.
[47:16] Now she must react
[47:17] accordingly. I pray father you would
[47:20] help us we can do likewise. Bless us
[47:24] tonight together we pray in the name of
[47:26] the Lord Jesus. And the saint said amen.
[47:30] You may be seated. Let's turn together
[47:32] if you would and 2 Corinthians chap
[47:37] 11 verse two which we looked at last
[47:41] Wednesday night.
[47:43] Paul again, another
[47:47] Eleazar, not in a natural sense going to
[47:52] the land of Padan Haram, but sent to
[47:57] Ephesus, sent to
[47:59] Thessalonica, to Cree, the capitalists,
[48:03] sent to the major gentile cities in that
[48:07] day for the same purpose, to get a
[48:11] bride, not for Abraham's son, but for
[48:16] God's son. And Paul sees very well his
[48:21] position in the gospel of that age. And
[48:25] I pointed out to you last week again,
[48:26] not to repeat myself, but just so that
[48:28] you'll understand the emphasis of it of
[48:31] it, that Paul is the only writer in the
[48:34] New Testament that claims this authority
[48:39] that he had the ability to be able to
[48:43] betro or engage a bride for Christ.
[48:48] Peter never claims this, nor does James,
[48:52] nor does any of the rest of the New
[48:54] Testament writers, but Paul does. So
[48:57] that sets a precedent for us that we can
[49:00] see that God will use a certain man and
[49:05] out from under that man's ministry will
[49:08] come others. They will not be of the
[49:10] same caliber that that man will be, but
[49:14] they will carry the same message. Now
[49:17] the word I'll refresh your memory that
[49:20] that they used was the Hebrew word was
[49:23] shashabin which is ben which means son
[49:26] of but the Greek word word was a paran
[49:30] nymph p a r a n y m p paran nymph. So it
[49:38] is one that is speaking on behalf of the
[49:42] bridegroom. So the bridegroom never came
[49:46] himself, but he sent a messenger as
[49:49] Abraham did for Isaac. Now watch Paul
[49:54] and notice the place where we're reading
[49:56] at 2 Corinthians 11. So this is about
[50:01] five years after the first book of
[50:04] Corinthians was written. We can
[50:07] definitely see a lot of growth in this
[50:10] Corinthian church. and they've been able
[50:13] to grow in understanding. They've got
[50:15] the adultery taken care of. They've got
[50:18] fornication taken care of. They've got
[50:21] the gifts and a lot of those things
[50:23] which was major problems in first
[50:26] Corinthians that Paul did not have to
[50:28] address in 2 Corinthians. But now as
[50:31] they have advanced, so also has Satan
[50:36] advanced his moves. Now what has
[50:40] happened is that there is a false
[50:43] apostle. There is other men that's come
[50:46] in behind Paul and now they are telling
[50:49] the Corinthian believers that they also
[50:53] have an illumination that they have
[50:56] something to say as well. But the
[50:59] problem is they're not saying what Paul
[51:02] said. That's right. So they were
[51:04] preaching as it were another Jesus and
[51:08] another gospel and evidently another
[51:11] Holy Ghost. So Paul is now really
[51:16] concerned about the state of this
[51:19] church. But now remember the Lord Jesus
[51:22] told him before he goes to this city,
[51:25] well after he gets there, he's only
[51:26] there for a while when he starts having
[51:28] meetings in these public places. And
[51:31] then the Lord speaks to him and tells
[51:33] him, "I have much people in this city."
[51:38] This is the only place in the New
[51:40] Testament that it's written this way
[51:43] that the Lord ever spoke to his
[51:45] messenger and told him this. So, did he
[51:49] need this special word from the Lord?
[51:51] Maybe. Who knows exactly what God's
[51:53] reason was. But even in spite of that
[51:57] rama word from God that God let him know
[52:01] that he had a lot of people in this city
[52:04] of Corinth. Now the church has moved
[52:08] into a state to where Paul is really
[52:12] concerned. And I find this amazing
[52:14] because he didn't say this in first
[52:17] Corinthians whenever there was a man in
[52:19] the church that was actually living with
[52:23] his stepmother. I'm talking about
[52:25] sexually. And they were letting them
[52:27] come to church and the elders, nobody
[52:30] was saying anything about it. And they
[52:33] were living filthy, ungodly lives. And
[52:37] the church was just, you know, letting
[52:39] it go on. And Paul rebuked them. Of
[52:42] course, they had all kinds of problems
[52:46] with the women with their hair and the
[52:48] way they were dressing and the gifts.
[52:50] And everybody had a psalm. If they
[52:52] didn't have a psalm, they had a song. If
[52:54] they didn't have a song, they had a
[52:56] tongue. They had a prophecy. They had
[52:57] this, that, and the other. But yet Paul
[53:00] at that stage of the church did not say
[53:05] what he's going to say to us tonight
[53:07] because they were not at the age of love
[53:15] yet. You see, they were still children.
[53:20] They were still
[53:23] infants in their understanding of the
[53:26] word. Not only did Paul knew that, but
[53:30] the devil knew it. So the devil then is
[53:33] not going to try to pull them aside to
[53:38] marry them
[53:40] himself because they're not at a
[53:43] marriageable age yet.
[53:47] So he's going to deal with them
[53:49] according to their spiritual age bracket
[53:54] which was what? Babies.
[53:58] Babies. But now notice five years later.
[54:03] Five years later. So Paul deals early on
[54:07] in second Corinthians and he he talks
[54:09] about correcting the man and how he went
[54:12] about it. And he didn't want to correct
[54:14] him too hard and push him. you know, too
[54:16] far out the other way. He goes on
[54:19] dealing with some other things and now
[54:20] he comes to this this state and he's
[54:24] identifying himself here unlike he does
[54:28] in any other epistle in the New
[54:30] Testament. 2 Corinthians
[54:33] 11:2 and he said, "I am jealous over you
[54:38] with
[54:39] godly jealousy." with godly jealousy.
[54:44] Now I have acted as a parony nymph for
[54:50] the Lord Jesus. He has sent me down to
[54:54] this city and I have stood on his
[54:58] behalf. And I'm not asked you to marry
[55:02] me. I've not asked you to marry any of
[55:05] the clergy. But I have told you that I'm
[55:08] here to represent the Lord Jesus. And I
[55:12] have stood between him and you. And I
[55:16] have stood there as Moses did in the
[55:20] book of
[55:21] Exodus. I preached to you the blood of
[55:24] the covenant. I preached to you the
[55:27] correct name for water
[55:30] baptism. I've introduced you to an
[55:33] element of the
[55:35] supernatural. And I have engaged you to
[55:38] Christ. So let's say it like this. as it
[55:41] was with Rebecca that the earrings which
[55:45] was the ability to hear the gospel. So I
[55:50] put the earrings of the hearing of the
[55:54] gospel on your ears and you responded.
[55:59] Now remember some of these daughters of
[56:02] God had formerly been priestess. Corinth
[56:06] was a port city, a very wicked, evil
[56:11] city. And they had all kinds of temples
[56:14] there. And they worshiped gods and
[56:16] goddesses, both Greek and Roman. And
[56:20] much of their worship, they would have
[56:23] sex acts. So they would have men or
[56:26] women, depending on which one you
[56:29] wanted. And they would have with their
[56:31] worship, they would have sex acts
[56:34] involved in it. Don't sit there and look
[56:36] at me like you don't know what I'm
[56:38] talking about. And think that this some
[56:41] of the daughters of God and sons of God,
[56:45] that's what they used to be. That was
[56:48] the life they were involved in. And Paul
[56:52] by the grace of God had been able to
[56:55] preach to them a delivering gospel and
[56:58] ministered to them the power of God that
[57:01] had set them free. As a matter of fact,
[57:04] Paul refers to him and said the ungodly,
[57:07] the unclean, the unwashed, and he called
[57:09] several different things. And he said,
[57:11] "Men lovers of themselves," which mean
[57:14] they were homosexual. And he said, "Such
[57:17] were some of you, but now are you
[57:21] washed? Are you clean?" So the gospel
[57:25] had done a great thing for them. And
[57:28] Paul had actually been able to introduce
[57:31] to them the marriage covenant, but they
[57:35] had not yet entered into it. But he had
[57:38] told them about it. So they had come
[57:41] under the sprinkling of the blood and
[57:46] their hearts had been anointed and they
[57:49] had now entered in in this time frame to
[57:52] where they matured some and they're at
[57:55] the age of marriage. So they were not a
[57:59] little girl. Now remember the bride that
[58:01] the Lord Jesus is going to rapture in
[58:04] the last days is not going to be a five
[58:08] or six year old little girl. She's not
[58:10] going to be a 12y old girl, a
[58:13] 13-year-old girl. She's going to be of
[58:17] marriageable age. Now, this is why Satan
[58:21] will progress and advance his techniques
[58:25] and the way that he will tempt and try
[58:28] to seduce those of us who've been
[58:31] birthed under Malachi 4. God's done
[58:35] exactly the same thing in this day with
[58:38] the message of Malachi 4 to bring us
[58:41] into a stage of engagement or
[58:45] betroal. But it's yet to be
[58:49] declared whether many will be presented
[58:53] or not.
[58:55] You see, there's a great difference
[58:57] between betroal and
[59:00] presentation. Now watch Paul. I am
[59:03] jealous over you with godly jealousy.
[59:08] Now, he's not jealous because that they
[59:11] belong to him. You see, this is
[59:15] something that people don't understand
[59:17] about the sheep of God and and the
[59:20] relation that true ministry have toward
[59:23] the children of God. It's not that they
[59:26] are my children. They are not my wife.
[59:30] They are not in the rest of these
[59:32] preacher brothers. They're not our wives
[59:34] at all. But as ministers, we also are
[59:39] jealous over God's bride because not
[59:43] because they love us as husband, but
[59:47] because they are loved by our master.
[59:52] Just like you mothers and fathers, if
[59:54] you saw your sons and daughters going
[59:57] toward the world and getting caught up
[59:59] as things of the world, there's nothing
[1:00:01] wrong with you feeling a godly jealousy
[1:00:05] raised up in your heart that you are
[1:00:08] jealous of that son of yours or that
[1:00:11] daughter of yours that you do not want
[1:00:14] them to give their self over to the
[1:00:16] vices of the age that we are living in.
[1:00:20] I am jealous over you as the sheep that
[1:00:24] God has put under my charge. Not that I
[1:00:27] want you as my own. I do not. But I am
[1:00:31] jealous over you because he loves you so
[1:00:35] much. Now notice the state that Paul
[1:00:38] expresses this and he identifies this.
[1:00:40] He says as godly jealousy. Now,
[1:00:44] preachers can have jealousy. And let me
[1:00:47] tell you how it can work sometimes,
[1:00:49] especially if they're a pastor. That's
[1:00:51] another preacher will come in and his
[1:00:54] ministry will bless the congregation and
[1:00:57] the pastor won't have him back no more
[1:00:59] because he heard too many comments about
[1:01:01] the people enjoyed it. Well, you see,
[1:01:03] that's not a godly jealousy at all.
[1:01:06] That's a man that don't know who he is,
[1:01:08] first of all. Because if you are helped,
[1:01:12] I'm helped. If a preacher comes in here
[1:01:14] and preaches circles around me and
[1:01:17] preaches so good and so wonderful and
[1:01:21] you are healed and delivered and set
[1:01:24] free, I'm going to be blessed cuz it's
[1:01:26] going to make my load a little bit
[1:01:28] easier for at least three or four days
[1:01:32] till you come off the mountaintop. And
[1:01:34] if a preacher comes in here and couldn't
[1:01:36] preach himself out of a paper bag, that
[1:01:40] means you ain't Oh my, you'll be so
[1:01:42] excited for the next time I preach. So,
[1:01:44] you know what? Whether they can preach
[1:01:46] or they can't preach, I have nothing to
[1:01:49] be jealous of. Let me just settle this
[1:01:51] for you in case you're wondering. There
[1:01:52] is not one man in this message that I am
[1:01:56] jealous of tonight. There's men that can
[1:01:59] out preach me, out sing me, out quote
[1:02:02] me. And I know I'm one of the ugliest
[1:02:04] preachers that ever lived. I know that.
[1:02:06] Matter of fact, I've been told that by
[1:02:08] one of the sisters of our church here,
[1:02:09] so I am reminded of
[1:02:13] that. Well, it didn't bother me cuz I
[1:02:15] know it's the truth. But I'm not
[1:02:17] jealous. There's good-looking preachers
[1:02:19] around the message. Well, you know what?
[1:02:21] Apparently, God knew I couldn't be
[1:02:23] good-looking, so he made me ugly. God
[1:02:25] knew I couldn't preach good, so he made
[1:02:27] me, you know, whatever I am. But
[1:02:29] therefore, I know who I am in Christ
[1:02:32] Jesus. It'd do a lot of the rest you all
[1:02:34] to come to the same place. A lot of the
[1:02:36] jealousy and hard feelings among singers
[1:02:39] and musicians and preachers if we'd
[1:02:42] realize it that way and realize we are
[1:02:44] so carnal when we look at it like that.
[1:02:47] So Paul wanted them to know, look, I I
[1:02:50] am I am not jealous over you with a
[1:02:52] human jealousy, but with a godly
[1:02:54] jealousy. For I have, not we, not me and
[1:02:59] Peter and James and Luke and Matthew and
[1:03:00] Mark. But I I have espoused you to one
[1:03:07] husband, a spouse, to join, to fit
[1:03:10] together, to betro a
[1:03:14] daughter, a daughter to anyone, to give
[1:03:18] one in marriage to
[1:03:21] another. Oh my. Paul said, I have a
[1:03:25] spouse you Oh, thank God. to one husband
[1:03:29] that I may have past tense may future.
[1:03:36] May is still questionable.
[1:03:40] Now you see we say because we're called
[1:03:43] bride and we're engaged, we make that
[1:03:47] the seal. That's false
[1:03:50] doctrine. Come on.
[1:03:54] That's contrary to the scripture.
[1:03:56] betrothed is not presented. Amen. Ask
[1:04:01] Adam.
[1:04:02] Ask God.
[1:04:05] Praise the Lord. Now watch Paul as he
[1:04:08] sets this forth. He said, "I'm jealous
[1:04:10] over you with godly jealousy." For I
[1:04:13] have I've already done this. I have
[1:04:16] espoused you. I'm your father in the
[1:04:18] gospel and you're my sons and daughters
[1:04:21] as far as the word. and I have espoused
[1:04:24] you as a godly father to the Lord Jesus
[1:04:29] that I may present you as a chase
[1:04:34] virgin. Not an
[1:04:36] absolute but I may
[1:04:40] not you're already presented.
[1:04:43] Look at the word present. Stand by. to
[1:04:47] place beside or near to present a person
[1:04:51] for another to see and question to bring
[1:04:55] to bring near metaphorically to bring
[1:04:57] into one's fellowship or intimacy. I
[1:05:01] acted as the paran as the bridegroom's
[1:05:05] friend and this is as far as I've been
[1:05:08] able to bring you thus far. Now I have
[1:05:11] betrolled you as a bride to
[1:05:15] Christ, but time will tell whether I
[1:05:19] will present
[1:05:20] you or will you be judged as a
[1:05:27] Woo! Help us, Jesus. Y'all know I
[1:05:31] was preaching this way now. You'd have
[1:05:32] prayed more, wouldn't you? that I may
[1:05:35] present you as a chasteed virgin to
[1:05:40] Christ. Now Paul as the paronym then in
[1:05:45] the same capacity at the marriage supper
[1:05:50] he would be the one to present the bride
[1:05:53] if she's
[1:05:56] there if she's
[1:05:59] there as still being chased.
[1:06:04] But Satan will be allowed a space of
[1:06:08] time to try her with what? The very same
[1:06:14] message that betrothed her.
[1:06:19] She will not be betrothed with the
[1:06:21] message of Noah and then be tempted by
[1:06:25] the message of Moses. We have been
[1:06:28] betrod or engaged by the message of
[1:06:31] Malachi 4. And what message will we be
[1:06:34] tempted by?
[1:06:40] You didn't say it, but I hope you know
[1:06:41] it. This same message.
[1:06:46] You see, the engaged woman owes her love
[1:06:50] and allegiance to no one but her
[1:06:54] betrothed. And if she shares
[1:06:59] herself with another man, then she is
[1:07:03] actually identified as an
[1:07:07] adulteress. Notice in verse three, but I
[1:07:11] fear.
[1:07:15] Why? What? If being engaged is the seal
[1:07:20] and being called
[1:07:24] bride is the seal. I mean, you're sure
[1:07:26] we're bride. That means we're going in,
[1:07:28] does
[1:07:31] it? Let us rejoice and make merry for
[1:07:34] the marriage of the lamb has come and
[1:07:38] his
[1:07:40] what?
[1:07:42] Not bride,
[1:07:43] his wife.
[1:07:48] his
[1:07:49] wife. Friends, do you understand
[1:07:51] there'll be thousands of people that
[1:07:53] have followed this message under the
[1:07:55] title bride that will
[1:08:00] never make his wife?
[1:08:04] Come on now. The question
[1:08:06] is, will you?
[1:08:13] But I
[1:08:14] fear less by any
[1:08:18] means as the
[1:08:21] serpent. Ofus, the Greek word there,
[1:08:24] ofus, the serpent, the one who deceived
[1:08:28] Eve, was regarded by the Jews as the
[1:08:32] devil. Now, wonder why Paul, brother
[1:08:34] Daryl, didn't fear when there's having
[1:08:36] problems about hair and dress and
[1:08:39] adultery. Isn't that major? Yes, that's
[1:08:41] pretty major stuff. But Paul knew where
[1:08:44] they were and he was looking at the
[1:08:47] temptation that Satan was dealing with
[1:08:50] them on and he could see that they were
[1:08:52] still at the immature infant stage and
[1:08:56] he knew the time of love had not yet
[1:08:59] come.
[1:09:01] So in other words, they could not become
[1:09:05] pregnantated by the devil and sealed off
[1:09:09] in their womb from the seed
[1:09:13] word. But now Paul is
[1:09:18] afraid. Afraid of the devil. No, not
[1:09:22] afraid of the devil, but afraid that
[1:09:25] some of those people in the Corinthian
[1:09:27] church is going to be pulled off by
[1:09:30] false
[1:09:31] apostles, false teachers.
[1:09:34] Now, they're at the time that they're a
[1:09:39] woman. They're at the marriageable
[1:09:43] age. They're not a little girl, which
[1:09:46] cannot
[1:09:47] conceive. You follow me? But they're at
[1:09:50] their spiritual stage when they can
[1:09:56] conceive. And Satan knows it. And Paul
[1:10:00] knows. Satan knows.
[1:10:06] But I fear less by any means as the
[1:10:10] serpent beguiles Eve. What in the world
[1:10:14] are we doing going back to the Garden of
[1:10:16] Eden again?
[1:10:19] I mentioned it to you last Wednesday
[1:10:21] night. The setting in the Garden of Eden
[1:10:25] has occurred
[1:10:27] millions of times.
[1:10:32] It's happened in your life. Only God
[1:10:34] knows how many.
[1:10:36] Same thing, exact same thing in my life
[1:10:40] in the life of every person that's
[1:10:43] turned away from the Lord Jesus. It
[1:10:46] happened in their life.
[1:10:48] Why? It works. Yeah. Why spend all your
[1:10:52] time trying to come up as something
[1:10:54] better if you've got something that
[1:10:57] works? Just use the same thing over and
[1:11:01] over again. Amen.
[1:11:06] Oh my. But as the serpent begal Eve
[1:11:11] through his
[1:11:13] subility, so
[1:11:17] your what?
[1:11:20] Minds should be corrupted from the
[1:11:23] simplicity that is in Christ. And the
[1:11:25] word translated for simplicity is
[1:11:29] sincerity and singleness of devotion.
[1:11:33] So a divided heart leads to a defiled
[1:11:36] life, an erect
[1:11:39] relationship with one another and with
[1:11:43] God. Now watch the prophet in question
[1:11:46] answer 64. He picks up this same
[1:11:49] position and he says, "You're my
[1:11:51] children that I've begotten to
[1:11:53] Christ. I claim every one of you. I
[1:11:57] claim you tonight. I claim you all the
[1:12:00] time.
[1:12:01] always claim it as my brother and
[1:12:04] sister. Well, I mean, I I guess I don't
[1:12:06] understand this. If if if by following
[1:12:09] the message and believing Brother Random
[1:12:11] was a prophet is a sealed finished
[1:12:15] work, why is he still claiming?
[1:12:20] Why is he still claiming message
[1:12:22] followers over and over and over
[1:12:27] again if it's a completed finished
[1:12:31] work? Sounds like a waste of time to me.
[1:12:35] Unless of course it's not quite a
[1:12:38] finished work.
[1:12:43] I always claim as my brother and sister,
[1:12:46] you're my children. I'm your father in
[1:12:47] the gospel, not fathers. It would be a
[1:12:50] priest. But I'm your father in the
[1:12:52] gospel. As Paul said there, I have
[1:12:54] begotten you to Christ. And now I
[1:12:57] espouse you to
[1:12:59] Christ.
[1:13:01] That's engage you to Christ as a
[1:13:04] chasteed
[1:13:07] virgin. Don't let me
[1:13:11] down. Don't let me down.
[1:13:16] So you mean the prophet had had
[1:13:19] recognized there was a group of people
[1:13:21] there. This is 1964. Now it lets us know
[1:13:25] where God saw the church was by giving
[1:13:29] the messages especially after the
[1:13:31] opening of the seals. Christ the mystery
[1:13:33] of God revealed. And then he says the
[1:13:36] token. And he said that the token had to
[1:13:38] follow after the opening of the seals.
[1:13:40] And what was the token? It was a further
[1:13:43] revelation of where God was moving. And
[1:13:45] you imagine the prophet standing there
[1:13:47] and saying, "I done preached the Holy
[1:13:49] Ghost series in
[1:13:50] 1959." And now we stand in his preaching
[1:13:53] a token message and making it sound as
[1:13:56] if though it is something beyond what he
[1:14:00] preached in the Holy Ghost series in
[1:14:02] 1959. What's he preaching to in 1959?
[1:14:05] Many of them Pentecostals. and they had
[1:14:08] a Pentecostal experience. But did they
[1:14:12] have the token? No. No, they did not.
[1:14:14] It's evident they
[1:14:16] didn't. So, the application of the token
[1:14:19] is moving from just a baptism in your
[1:14:23] spirit, which Elvis Presley had. Come
[1:14:26] on.
[1:14:28] Elvis Presley had the baptism of the
[1:14:32] Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:14:36] and died lost
[1:14:39] and went to
[1:14:41] hell and is in shield this night
[1:14:46] screaming and begging for
[1:14:49] mercy in the regions of the
[1:14:54] lost. Every night after his concerts, he
[1:14:59] would go back to his hotel
[1:15:01] room. Y'all know what he sang? gospel
[1:15:05] songs,
[1:15:08] the Stamps Quartet, which would sing
[1:15:10] with him on the platform. I saw one of
[1:15:13] their things the other day on YouTube
[1:15:14] and they talking about how he loved God
[1:15:16] and how he loved gospel music and how
[1:15:19] that they would sat around the piano for
[1:15:21] hours into the wee hours of the morning
[1:15:23] cuz Elvis loved gospel music. And then
[1:15:27] they played a clip of them singing the
[1:15:29] song, the sweet, sweet spirit in this
[1:15:33] place. And there stood Elvis with tears
[1:15:37] running out of his eyes bawling and
[1:15:40] crying as they sang. You know why? Cuz
[1:15:43] he had felt the spirit of God. Where did
[1:15:46] he learn that dance of shaking his legs
[1:15:50] and dancing around? He learned it in an
[1:15:52] Assembly of God church. Amen.
[1:15:56] Oh
[1:16:03] children, as Paul said, I have begotten
[1:16:06] you to Christ and now I espouseed you to
[1:16:08] Christ. That's engaged you to Christ as
[1:16:11] a chasteed virgin. Don't let me down.
[1:16:14] Don't let me
[1:16:16] down. You stay a chasteed virgin.
[1:16:21] Now, I want you to notice that that that
[1:16:23] the bride in this stage in 1964 that
[1:16:28] there's an element of the people in the
[1:16:30] message that are at the time of
[1:16:34] love. They're at the
[1:16:37] marriageable age. Now, there was some
[1:16:40] that was just coming in and they were
[1:16:42] babies. So, nobody in their right mind
[1:16:44] would want to marry a three-year-old
[1:16:46] girl. Nobody would want to marry a five
[1:16:48] or six year old girl. But there were
[1:16:50] some people in the message at the time
[1:16:53] that was at the marriageable age. Go
[1:16:55] through question answers and listen at
[1:16:58] some of the questions that they asked
[1:16:59] him and you'll find out some of them
[1:17:02] were still in kindergarten but they were
[1:17:05] some of them was at the marriageable age
[1:17:07] and by this time some of the preachers
[1:17:10] that was around the message had already
[1:17:13] started raising
[1:17:15] up. Now watch what he says. He says, "Oh
[1:17:19] my, oh God, help us. Don't let me down."
[1:17:23] What's he got to do? Is
[1:17:26] it? Why would he say that? As if though
[1:17:29] it was personal. It was personal. Why?
[1:17:33] He'll be the one that'll stand there and
[1:17:36] present this age to Christ.
[1:17:41] Don't let me down. Don't let me down.
[1:17:44] You stay a chase virgin. I want you to
[1:17:47] notice that that the bride staying a
[1:17:50] chase
[1:17:51] virgin is not given to the work of the
[1:17:55] Holy Ghost alone. Right? Our brother
[1:17:59] Brandon would have never had a need to
[1:18:01] tell us you stay a chase virgin. He
[1:18:03] could have just said now don't worry
[1:18:05] about it. The Holy Ghost will and you
[1:18:06] just go on do whatever you know. And the
[1:18:08] Holy Ghost said don't you let me down.
[1:18:12] Don't you let me down. You stay a chased
[1:18:17] virgin. Oh my. How will I do it, Brother
[1:18:21] Brandham? Stay right with the word. Live
[1:18:26] clean and
[1:18:28] pure. Have nothing to do with the things
[1:18:32] of the world.
[1:18:34] Amen.
[1:18:36] I wonder how many people were sitting
[1:18:38] right there in question answers
[1:18:40] 1964 that were actually engaged to the
[1:18:44] Lord
[1:18:45] Jesus under the ministry of Malachi
[1:18:48] 4 and they
[1:18:50] lasted several years afterwards and then
[1:18:53] this preacher come up and this doctrine
[1:18:55] come up. Notice the first thing that it
[1:18:57] says, stay right with the word. That's
[1:19:01] not the ones you agree with. That's the
[1:19:04] ones you don't even like.
[1:19:08] You see, it's not those words that we go
[1:19:10] along with that that that that's going
[1:19:12] to try us. It's those that Satan will
[1:19:14] try to Well, you know, you you you know,
[1:19:22] oh my. You see, the prophet
[1:19:26] Jeremiah in the Old Testament reflected
[1:19:29] a same type of shadow and type. He saw
[1:19:33] the people of Judah. By now, of course,
[1:19:37] Israel and Judah had separated and God
[1:19:39] gave Judah their prophets and and Israel
[1:19:41] their prophets. Sometime they'd be a
[1:19:42] blend over of of them back and forth.
[1:19:44] They had their own kings, their own
[1:19:46] kingdoms, their own capital city. And
[1:19:48] Jeremiah was prophesying um to the
[1:19:51] people of Judah and he saw them losing
[1:19:54] their their love for God, their first
[1:19:57] love. And he warned them. Read with me
[1:20:00] in Jeremiah chapter 2:2. Go and cry in
[1:20:04] the ears of
[1:20:06] Jerusalem, saying, Thus sayaeth the
[1:20:09] Lord, I remember
[1:20:12] thee, the kindness of thy
[1:20:16] youth, and the love of thine
[1:20:21] espousals, when thou witness after
[1:20:25] me in the wilderness and a land that was
[1:20:29] not sown. Now remember God says in the
[1:20:33] book of Jeremiah that return to me oh
[1:20:36] backslider for I am married unto you. So
[1:20:41] here God goes back now to the days of
[1:20:44] the Exodus and God said I remember how
[1:20:47] it used to be. I remember how it was
[1:20:50] whenever I first found you. It's Ezekiel
[1:20:53] 16 as well. Whenever I first found you,
[1:20:55] oh, you went after me. Then it wasn't
[1:20:59] just me going after you, but you
[1:21:01] actually went after me. Oh my, you
[1:21:06] actually went after me. You loved me and
[1:21:09] you wanted to be around me and you
[1:21:12] wanted to serve me. Oh, I remember your
[1:21:16] espousals. You were so passionate toward
[1:21:19] me and my word and my covenant. I
[1:21:22] remember
[1:21:25] that this verse of scripture breaks my
[1:21:30] heart. How many times has this great
[1:21:32] fountain of love been treated this way
[1:21:36] by human beings?
[1:21:39] He'll save
[1:21:40] them. They'll get started with a fervent
[1:21:43] love and go sometimes for
[1:21:45] decades and then whatever it is goes to
[1:21:48] pulling them this way or that way and
[1:21:50] their love falls and they'll either
[1:21:52] become educated and you know they don't
[1:21:53] need a move of God no more. Oh, we don't
[1:21:55] believe in signs and wonders and
[1:21:57] miracles or if he can't push them that
[1:21:58] way or try to push them off on the other
[1:22:00] side. I hope God never says to Word of
[1:22:04] Life Church, I remember you all. I
[1:22:08] remember how you used to love me. Oh,
[1:22:11] you couldn't wait to get to church. You
[1:22:15] couldn't wait to sing and clap your
[1:22:21] hands. Oh
[1:22:24] my. Thus sayeth the Lord, I remember
[1:22:26] thee, the kindness of thy use, the love
[1:22:30] of thine espouses, when thou wentest
[1:22:33] after me in the wilderness, in a land
[1:22:37] that was not sown.
[1:22:40] So the espousers were the intervals
[1:22:43] between Israel's betroal to God at the
[1:22:48] Exodus and the marriage covenant
[1:22:52] presentation at
[1:22:54] Sinai. Now remember they had their
[1:22:57] shortcomings all along that journey and
[1:23:00] they complained and they grumbled but
[1:23:02] God never cut them off in the prenuptual
[1:23:07] time. Why? He's still dealing with them
[1:23:10] as they are. They're immature. Can't you
[1:23:13] see, friends? Oh, God. I I've noticed it
[1:23:16] over and over again. There a lot of
[1:23:17] preachers even with a message. It's when
[1:23:20] they get old men. old men in their 60s
[1:23:24] or their 70s or older and that's when
[1:23:27] they get goofed up
[1:23:30] and they get a kingdom built around
[1:23:32] themsel and think they can do this or
[1:23:34] that or the other and give their 20s to
[1:23:37] God or their 30s to God or their 40s or
[1:23:39] 50s. Oh God, may we give him every day
[1:23:43] of our
[1:23:47] life. So you see the espousal.
[1:23:51] Oh
[1:23:53] my. Israel's betroal to God began at the
[1:23:59] Exodus. Notice in Exodus 24:6, "And
[1:24:02] Moses took half of the blood and put it
[1:24:06] in basins, and half of the blood he
[1:24:09] sprinkled on the altar." Now, notice
[1:24:11] that the blood is divided in two parts.
[1:24:15] So the altar gets half of the blood and
[1:24:19] the other half of the blood is put in a
[1:24:23] basin, not for
[1:24:27] storage. It's got to go on people.
[1:24:34] And he took the book of the
[1:24:37] covenant and read it in the audience of
[1:24:39] the people and they said, "All the Lord
[1:24:43] has said we will do and be
[1:24:47] obedient." That's the use of their
[1:24:53] espous. Oh God, you set us free out of
[1:24:56] Egypt. God, you done great things. Now
[1:24:59] remember, they complained about not
[1:25:00] having no meat and they complained about
[1:25:02] this and that and the other, but God
[1:25:04] knew where they were. Remember the Bible
[1:25:06] tells us that God could have led them
[1:25:08] another way and it would have been a
[1:25:10] shorter way, a quicker way, but God knew
[1:25:13] that the people would become discouraged
[1:25:15] because of war. So the shorter way, it
[1:25:18] might have been shorter in distance, but
[1:25:20] it been a whole lot harder battles.
[1:25:21] Sometimes you and I look and think,
[1:25:23] well, it looks like to me God made a
[1:25:24] mistake in my life. It'd be a lot
[1:25:26] shorter to go from here to there. Yeah,
[1:25:28] but God knew all the giants and all the
[1:25:29] things that be in front of you. And God
[1:25:31] was watching out for you. So, he sent
[1:25:33] you 27 miles around this way on this
[1:25:36] bypass because of his love and mercy.
[1:25:38] Thank you, Lord. And God knew where they
[1:25:41] were. They couldn't take it. But yet, he
[1:25:43] had Moses as his paronym of the Old
[1:25:47] Testament. And Moses stands up there and
[1:25:50] said, "Now, this is God's covenant. I'm
[1:25:52] not going to talk you all into doing
[1:25:54] this. I want to tell you what God said."
[1:25:56] And God is a jealous
[1:25:59] husband. God don't want you worshiping
[1:26:02] other
[1:26:03] gods. This is the way God is. Are you
[1:26:06] all
[1:26:07] sure that you want to be engaged to
[1:26:12] God? Oh my. That Oh yes. Yes. All that
[1:26:18] God has said will do. That sounds like
[1:26:21] somebody that just got saved, don't it?
[1:26:23] Oh God, I'll do anything. I'll do
[1:26:26] anything that won't last long after
[1:26:28] they've been a while. Well, how come I
[1:26:30] have to do that? Well, why do I have to
[1:26:32] give up that? Well, I don't understand
[1:26:34] that. Now, I don't understand that. Some
[1:26:35] of you parents that are so ignorant that
[1:26:39] teach your kids they can be anything
[1:26:42] they want to be. I've never heard such
[1:26:44] damnable ideas. Where do you get that at
[1:26:47] in the Bible? Don't teach your kids such
[1:26:50] Tommy Rock. Come on. Teach them they
[1:26:52] need to become what God wants them to
[1:26:55] be. So what if they want to be a lesbian
[1:26:58] or a homosexual? You going to let them
[1:27:00] do that, too?
[1:27:09] Oh, I don't know what it is about
[1:27:10] Wednesday night that John the Baptist
[1:27:12] comes in here, don't he? We need to
[1:27:14] start having church on Tuesday night.
[1:27:15] Maybe John will stay home
[1:27:20] now. Notice what Moses does. And Moses
[1:27:23] took the
[1:27:27] blood and sprinkled it on the people.
[1:27:32] So the altar got
[1:27:35] half and the people got the other half.
[1:27:43] Now they were
[1:27:46] engaged, betrothed to God.
[1:27:51] Notice and said, "Behold the blood of
[1:27:55] the covenant which the Lord hath made
[1:27:58] with you concerning all these
[1:28:01] words." Notice in Jeremiah
[1:28:03] 31:32, Jeremiah reiterates the same
[1:28:06] thing. Not according to the covenant
[1:28:07] that I made with their fathers in the
[1:28:09] day that I took them by the
[1:28:12] hand. Notice touching the hand
[1:28:16] again. when I took them by the
[1:28:20] hand to bring them out of the land of
[1:28:23] Egypt, which my covenant they break,
[1:28:27] although I was a
[1:28:31] husband unto them, saith the Lord. So
[1:28:35] God despicts Israel then in the Exodus
[1:28:38] time as a bride, a young bride.
[1:28:44] But by the time Jeremiah prophesies, she
[1:28:46] is no longer a young
[1:28:48] bride, but she's an older
[1:28:52] wife who sat around with her legs wide
[1:28:54] open to every man coming by. I know
[1:28:56] that's plain talk, but that's the Bible.
[1:29:03] I wonder, friends, if the same thing
[1:29:06] ain't happening today.
[1:29:09] It's unbelievable some of the absolute
[1:29:12] nonsense that preachers have preached
[1:29:14] around this
[1:29:17] message. It just overwhelms me. You
[1:29:20] think, God, how much worse is it going
[1:29:22] to
[1:29:23] get? But I know one thing. There's going
[1:29:26] to be a bride. Amen. Now, this young
[1:29:29] bride later becomes an unfaithful wife
[1:29:35] guilty of many sins. Now notice again in
[1:29:38] Jeremiah 2:3, Israel was
[1:29:44] holiness. Listen, what a statement.
[1:29:46] Israel was
[1:29:50] holiness unto the
[1:29:53] Lord.
[1:29:55] Holiness,
[1:29:57] cadesh,
[1:29:59] apartness,
[1:30:01] sacredness, separateness.
[1:30:05] So, Israel was set
[1:30:07] aside for the Lord
[1:30:10] only, not for the Philistines, the
[1:30:12] Amorites, the Hittites, Jebusites, this
[1:30:15] king, that king, this man, that man. Oh,
[1:30:17] no. No. Israel was holiness unto the
[1:30:22] Lord. So, their life belonged to him. He
[1:30:26] was the only God they were supposed to
[1:30:28] worship. The only God they were supposed
[1:30:29] to love. The only God whose names was
[1:30:32] supposed to be on their lips. And they
[1:30:34] were holiness. That's what holiness
[1:30:36] means. It's not just long hair. It's not
[1:30:38] just long dress. And we believe in all
[1:30:40] of that. But many people have a long
[1:30:42] hair and a long dress and got a big long
[1:30:44] tongue to match it because they don't
[1:30:45] bring holiness on the inside of their
[1:30:47] spirit and let their spirit be cleansed
[1:30:51] from the filthiness of their spirit.
[1:30:53] Come on, somebody.
[1:30:56] We don't want to just be holiness on the
[1:30:58] outside, but we want to be holiness on
[1:31:00] the inside. That we are separate. And
[1:31:02] this is why I said Sunday that our life
[1:31:06] is not our own.
[1:31:09] You can't say, "Well, I want to be this
[1:31:11] and I want to be that." Well, if you can
[1:31:12] do that, I should be able to do
[1:31:14] it. And I don't want to be a preacher.
[1:31:19] So if y'all can decide what you want to
[1:31:21] do. I decide from tonight on I ain't
[1:31:25] preaching no more. I'm tired of it.
[1:31:28] I'm sick of me telling you what to do
[1:31:30] and you do whatever you want to do and
[1:31:32] then you come back to me to fix the
[1:31:33] nonsense you've done. I'm sick of it.
[1:31:39] So I'm going to build
[1:31:41] furniture and lay
[1:31:43] rock and do
[1:31:45] landscaping. Anybody want to hire me?
[1:31:50] You'll be worse than Jonah was in the
[1:31:52] boat if you
[1:31:55] do. But why is it you think you can do
[1:31:58] what you want?
[1:32:01] But you would squall and ball and you
[1:32:03] would mo have mercy and they would tell
[1:32:05] what you would call me on Facebook and
[1:32:07] everything. Well, brother Donnie said he
[1:32:08] don't want to be a preacher. I cannot
[1:32:10] believe he does that. Well, that's the
[1:32:11] way you do. You think your own your own
[1:32:14] life belongs to you. Your life does not
[1:32:17] belong to you. You are not your own. You
[1:32:21] can't marry who you want to marry. You
[1:32:24] can't listen to things of the world. You
[1:32:27] can't do what the world says and does
[1:32:29] because you are holiness unto the Lord.
[1:32:44] Israel was
[1:32:46] holiness unto the Lord. Notice in Exodus
[1:32:51] 19:5. Now therefore, if you will obey my
[1:32:54] voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then
[1:32:57] you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[1:33:00] above all people.
[1:33:03] Now, this is the engagement here.
[1:33:06] Notice the engagement is filled with
[1:33:08] ifs.
[1:33:12] If you will obey my voice indeed and
[1:33:15] keep my covenant. If if
[1:33:20] if How could the very same God who
[1:33:23] brought them out into the land later
[1:33:25] divide them and set them all across the
[1:33:27] world and they still are to this day? It
[1:33:30] is called the
[1:33:31] diaspora which means they have been
[1:33:33] dispensed all over the world. Yes.
[1:33:39] Of course, as humans beings do, the Jews
[1:33:41] blame God. Huh? Blame God for your own
[1:33:44] sins. Right.
[1:33:47] Mama. For all the earth is mine. And ye
[1:33:51] shall be unto me a kingdom of priests
[1:33:55] and a holy nation.
[1:33:58] These are the words which thou shalt
[1:34:01] speak unto the children of
[1:34:04] Israel. So Israel is to be
[1:34:07] holiness unto the Lord. Holiness, not
[1:34:12] just a name. Now, now remember the high
[1:34:15] priest wore this across his
[1:34:19] head. When he went into the presence of
[1:34:23] God, he wore these words. Holiness
[1:34:28] unto the Lord. He signified the whole
[1:34:32] tribes, the whole encampment of
[1:34:35] Israel. We are set
[1:34:37] apart. That's why God did not want them
[1:34:41] Philistines and Amorites and Hittites. I
[1:34:45] know people even to this very day don't
[1:34:47] understand. And people call it cruel
[1:34:49] that God had them to kill them people
[1:34:51] and get out of there. that a little
[1:34:53] Philistine grows up to be a big
[1:34:55] Philistine and a little Amorite grows up
[1:34:57] to be a big Amorite. And God said, "I
[1:35:00] don't want you doing that. You are
[1:35:02] separate to me. I want you marrying
[1:35:04] among your own. Them people out there
[1:35:07] worship idols. They do this and that and
[1:35:09] the other." Come on, church. Somebody
[1:35:11] say amen. God has exactly the same
[1:35:14] standard today. He wants his bride to be
[1:35:18] holiness unto the Lord. Not just a long
[1:35:21] dress, but thank God a true baptism of
[1:35:24] the Holy Ghost. And not only that, but
[1:35:27] believes that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:35:29] yesterday, today, and forever. If he
[1:35:32] healed the sick in the book of Acts, he
[1:35:34] still heals them today. If he did
[1:35:36] miracles 25 years ago, he still does
[1:35:39] miracles tonight because he is a miracle
[1:35:42] working God.
[1:35:52] fully
[1:35:54] consecrated to his
[1:35:56] service. So the spiritual Israel, which
[1:36:00] is
[1:36:00] us, we are chosen to wear the same thing
[1:36:05] on our
[1:36:06] foreheads. Holiness
[1:36:09] to the Lord. Yes. Amen. Holiness.
[1:36:13] There's places we don't go.
[1:36:16] There's music we don't listen to. Books
[1:36:20] we don't read. Movies we don't watch.
[1:36:27] Amen. And if you watch anything and
[1:36:29] everything, more than likely you ain't
[1:36:30] got the Holy Ghost. And you better get
[1:36:32] it if you're planning on going in the
[1:36:34] rapture. Cuz I'm going to tell you one
[1:36:36] thing. You ain't going out of here with
[1:36:37] a message book in your hand. You ain't
[1:36:39] going out here say I go to brother
[1:36:40] Donny's church. That don't mean no more
[1:36:42] than saying you go into a hog pin.
[1:36:44] You've got to have the seal of the Holy
[1:36:46] Ghost on your soul. And if you do, your
[1:36:49] own life will express holiness unto the
[1:36:52] Lord. I don't live right just because
[1:36:55] I'm in front of you. I live the same
[1:36:57] when I'm by myself. It's when you're
[1:37:00] around. Why? Because I'm living that way
[1:37:02] before my Lord. I want to be a holiness
[1:37:05] preacher. Not just when I'm in the pull
[1:37:08] pit, but when there ain't nobody around
[1:37:10] me. I want to live right. I want to talk
[1:37:12] right. I want to do right because I want
[1:37:15] my life to be holiness to the Lord.
[1:37:19] Anybody else want to be holiness to the
[1:37:21] Lord? We don't do what we want to do. He
[1:37:25] bought my life.
[1:37:37] You see, they were not allowed to do
[1:37:39] what they wanted to do. They couldn't
[1:37:42] even worship the way they thought. They
[1:37:45] couldn't even build the place of worship
[1:37:48] the way they thought. God told them how
[1:37:50] to do it, when to do it, the material to
[1:37:52] do it, and how long to make it, how wide
[1:37:53] to make it, how tall to make it, and who
[1:37:55] to make it. You don't just give to God
[1:37:58] what you want. Said, "Well, there it is.
[1:38:02] People think God's hard up. Well, he'll
[1:38:04] take anything. He ain't taking your
[1:38:05] garbage and your trash. He wants your
[1:38:08] best.
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:13] So, Israel was a consecrated offering to
[1:38:22] Yahweh. They were the first of God's
[1:38:26] consecrated property.
[1:38:30] the first
[1:38:31] fruits of the whole
[1:38:37] harvest. Glory to
[1:38:39] God. Israel was the first
[1:38:42] nation. Glory that God
[1:38:46] separated for himself.
[1:38:50] Can't you see why he looked upon it in
[1:38:52] such a vile way for what they did?
[1:38:56] When the kings would start marrying, you
[1:38:58] imagine Solomon, the great man that
[1:39:00] built the house of God, and then he
[1:39:01] started marrying the daughter of
[1:39:03] Pharaoh, and he married this woman and
[1:39:05] that woman. And of course, they wanted
[1:39:07] their own church cuz they wasn't going
[1:39:08] to go to the message church.
[1:39:11] Preach it. Come on, somebody. If you
[1:39:14] can't say amen, say ouch. Or at least
[1:39:16] wiggle your finger so I know you're
[1:39:17] still alive.
[1:39:20] So what did he do? The same man that
[1:39:22] built the house of God had to wind up
[1:39:25] building Pharaoh's daughter her own
[1:39:27] place of idolatry. And then the other
[1:39:30] Arabian princess, he had to build her
[1:39:32] one and her one. The very same man that
[1:39:35] built the house of God turned around
[1:39:37] built all the rest of those idol
[1:39:38] temples. That's true. Why? Cuz he
[1:39:41] married a heathen in the first place.
[1:39:43] Yes, sir.
[1:39:48] I'm telling you, children, you go ahead
[1:39:49] and do it.
[1:39:51] Marry you one of these denominational
[1:39:53] girls. Marry you some of these
[1:39:55] denominational men and you will pay.
[1:39:59] Come on.
[1:40:02] Amen.
[1:40:04] Oh
[1:40:07] God. How many of us do it?
[1:40:12] You bagg them. You give them scripture.
[1:40:15] You give them quotes
[1:40:18] and they do it anyway.
[1:40:22] But brother Donnie, I'm so lonely. I'm
[1:40:24] so lonely. I'm going to tell you what's
[1:40:26] worse than being single and being
[1:40:28] lonely. Being married to the wrong one
[1:40:32] and being lonely.
[1:40:37] I wonder how many lonely days that
[1:40:40] Solomon had with Pharaoh's daughter.
[1:40:46] But who was the queen of his
[1:40:50] art? The
[1:40:52] Shulamite. But that wasn't enough, was
[1:40:55] it? No. I had to marry this one for
[1:40:58] political gain and marry that one and
[1:40:59] marry that one and marry that
[1:41:02] one. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Good
[1:41:06] to be in church tonight, ain't it?
[1:41:08] Praise God.
[1:41:14] Deacon brothers, I guess you can go
[1:41:15] ahead and start calling all the
[1:41:16] ambulances around from the local
[1:41:17] hospitals. And we've got a sign out
[1:41:19] here. I'm sure if y'all noticed it,
[1:41:20] emergency entrance. And it comes all the
[1:41:22] way around this way. It's right back
[1:41:23] there at the back door. So they can haul
[1:41:25] us all out once we get done. I'll tell
[1:41:27] you one thing. I'd rather be slayed
[1:41:29] right now by the word of God than stand
[1:41:31] before the white throne judgment and God
[1:41:33] look at you and say, "Why did you
[1:41:35] disobey me?
[1:41:38] Why?
[1:41:46] Israel were the first
[1:41:50] fruits
[1:41:51] showing that there's going to be a lot
[1:41:55] more. You see, they were one of a
[1:41:59] kind first fruit. So are
[1:42:02] we. And that's why that God separated
[1:42:06] them from the rest of the nations.
[1:42:09] Actually, the
[1:42:11] unconsecrated
[1:42:12] nations would be
[1:42:15] punished by God's
[1:42:18] wrath for touching his first fruits.
[1:42:23] Why? The first fruits belong to God
[1:42:27] alone. That's right. So when your barley
[1:42:31] come to the ripest, you take the very
[1:42:33] first bundle of it, which would be on
[1:42:35] the certain side of the field that got
[1:42:37] the morning sun. And when you cut that
[1:42:40] down and you gave that to God. If any
[1:42:42] person ate that first fruits, they were
[1:42:44] to be
[1:42:46] killed. And God said, "Israel is my
[1:42:49] first fruits. Don't you touch them,
[1:42:52] Goliath.
[1:42:54] Don't you touch them, Philistines.
[1:42:58] God is a jealous God.
[1:43:05] Look, friends, he don't even want you
[1:43:07] putting your own ideas above his word,
[1:43:11] much less a preacher.
[1:43:13] Some of you won't put a preacher cuz you
[1:43:15] ain't going to follow no preacher.
[1:43:16] You're so stubborn, but you'll put your
[1:43:19] own damnable ideas.
[1:43:23] Bless him.
[1:43:25] At least if you're following a preacher,
[1:43:27] he'll have to have have to answer for
[1:43:29] you. But when you rebel against God's
[1:43:32] man preaching the truth, you understand
[1:43:34] there will be no one to stand with you.
[1:43:39] You will walk before God by yourself.
[1:43:44] I will not be there.
[1:43:59] Ezra was holiness unto the
[1:44:01] Lord and the first
[1:44:04] fruits of his
[1:44:07] increase. That is so humbling really
[1:44:09] when you think about it that
[1:44:11] God would call human
[1:44:14] beings the
[1:44:16] progeny of his increase.
[1:44:20] a bunch of dirt piles,
[1:44:25] weakless human beings.
[1:44:28] And God said, "But they're my first
[1:44:30] fruits. They're mine.
[1:44:33] I claim
[1:44:37] them." Israel was holiness unto the
[1:44:39] Lord. And the first fruits of his
[1:44:41] increase, all that devour him shall
[1:44:46] offend, and evil shall come upon them.
[1:44:50] saith the Lord.
[1:44:53] Let them blast
[1:44:55] us. Let them plaster our name all over
[1:44:58] YouTube. Let them plaster God's prophet
[1:45:01] name all over YouTube. Let them say
[1:45:03] whatever they want to say. But remember,
[1:45:05] God's word will not return unto him
[1:45:07] void. Call us a cult and stand before
[1:45:10] the white throne judgment of God and God
[1:45:12] will make you give an account for
[1:45:14] calling his queen an occult. Oh my.
[1:45:18] Amen.
[1:45:22] You'll get by with it in this life.
[1:45:24] That's to delay the judgment, to harden
[1:45:27] your heart, to coax you into saying
[1:45:36] more. You see, consecrated
[1:45:39] nations were not to touch them. Those
[1:45:42] who persecute God's children have a
[1:45:45] grievous burden to bear.
[1:45:48] The nation of Judah had
[1:45:51] lost their honeymoon
[1:45:56] love. So now it had come down to just
[1:45:59] the humrum of
[1:46:02] marriage that got back off the
[1:46:05] honeymoon and now it's getting up every
[1:46:07] day and fixing the eggs and they didn't
[1:46:10] eat bacon but eggs and whatever else
[1:46:12] they ate.
[1:46:15] and you know, mopping the tent floor.
[1:46:17] Well, I guess you'd have a tent floor,
[1:46:19] would you? Anyway, whatever they done,
[1:46:21] taking care of the babies and milking
[1:46:23] the goats and cattle and whatever more
[1:46:26] and just everyday life.
[1:46:30] And they needed a little bit of an
[1:46:32] excitement going to
[1:46:35] church. So, they started having affairs
[1:46:39] on
[1:46:42] God. Because going to church become
[1:46:45] some, you know, just so humrum and just,
[1:46:47] oh my goodness, you can time it. I mean,
[1:46:50] you know, brother Louie is going to get
[1:46:51] up early and he's going to be two, three
[1:46:52] minutes late and then so and so is going
[1:46:55] to do this and they're going to get so
[1:46:56] and so to pray and then they're going to
[1:46:58] read the prayer request and they're
[1:46:59] going to do this and they're going to do
[1:47:00] that.
[1:47:03] Well, if you're so against repetition,
[1:47:06] why is it that you brothers put the same
[1:47:09] britch's leg, the same leg in your
[1:47:12] britches, the same one that you've done
[1:47:14] for the last 48 years? Why do you put
[1:47:17] one sock on first before you do the
[1:47:20] other one? Why is it that you start at
[1:47:22] the top or the bottom of your shirt if
[1:47:24] you're wearing buttons and you do it in
[1:47:25] a certain way? You know why? Because
[1:47:26] you're methodical. It would surprise you
[1:47:29] if you knew how much every day of your
[1:47:31] life is committed to your subconscious
[1:47:33] and you do it in a methodical way. Well,
[1:47:35] why don't you despise that? Why don't
[1:47:37] you start wearing your shirt inside out?
[1:47:40] Why don't you wear the tail of your
[1:47:41] shirt up here and then wear the collar
[1:47:43] down here where you can try to walk
[1:47:44] around like this? If you hate methodical
[1:47:46] thing, why don't you hate that the way
[1:47:48] you hate going to church? Why don't you
[1:47:50] hate going to Walmart the way, well, if
[1:47:52] I go to church, I'm going to stand there
[1:47:53] and clap my hand and brother Louie is
[1:47:55] going to say, "Come on now, everybody.
[1:47:56] Let's praise the Lord." Brother Donnie
[1:47:58] is going to get up there and start
[1:47:59] preaching and reading a bunch of quotes
[1:48:00] and sweating and running back and forth
[1:48:02] across the pull pit and going to say,
[1:48:03] "Is anybody going to say amen or not?"
[1:48:05] Come on, W. Let's say amen. And we're
[1:48:08] going to sit there and nod our heads and
[1:48:09] say, "Man, I am so sick and tired of
[1:48:11] doing that." Are you sick and tired of
[1:48:13] going to Walmart? Are you sick and tired
[1:48:15] of getting up and going to the same old
[1:48:17] job every day, clocking in at the same
[1:48:20] old time clock? Come on, somebody. Oh
[1:48:23] my. There ought to be such a passion
[1:48:26] inside of our heart that even if it does
[1:48:29] run in a similar pattern, we are so
[1:48:32] blessed to clap our hands. We are so
[1:48:35] blessed to worship God. We are so
[1:48:38] blessed to praise him.
[1:48:52] Ezekiel
[1:48:58] 16:8 God again reminding them of the way
[1:49:01] he found
[1:49:02] them. Now when I passed by thee and
[1:49:06] looked upon
[1:49:07] thee, behold thy
[1:49:11] time was the
[1:49:13] time of love.
[1:49:17] and I spread my
[1:49:20] skirt over
[1:49:23] thee. You see, now Israel has grown up.
[1:49:26] She's become a young
[1:49:28] woman and may I say a very beautiful
[1:49:31] young
[1:49:33] woman. The actually the adornment that
[1:49:36] she is wearing is quite remarkable.
[1:49:41] She has jewels and she has
[1:49:44] shoes, which more than likely none of
[1:49:47] them would have hardly had. Moses did.
[1:49:49] But the most rest of them being slaves,
[1:49:51] slaves didn't have
[1:49:53] shoes. But God allowed their shoes to be
[1:49:56] made out of the same material that the
[1:49:59] tabernacle was made out of.
[1:50:02] So God covered himself with this skin
[1:50:05] and God said, "I want you all to wear
[1:50:08] what I wear.
[1:50:11] So they had gold and they had silver and
[1:50:14] God said, "I give you corn and I give
[1:50:16] you my oil. This was my oil. I gave it
[1:50:19] to
[1:50:21] you and I passed by you and I found you
[1:50:24] in the time of
[1:50:26] love." So her hair had grown out. Now
[1:50:30] she's become a young
[1:50:32] woman. And I spread my skirt over
[1:50:36] thee. So now the skirt was the lower
[1:50:40] part of the man's
[1:50:44] garment. I spread my skirt over thee and
[1:50:48] covered thy
[1:50:50] nakedness. That ought to make every one
[1:50:52] of us want to shout hallelujah.
[1:50:55] Cuz that's the way we were in Leodosia.
[1:50:58] We were blind, naked, wretched,
[1:51:00] miserable, and didn't even know it. And
[1:51:02] the Lord God passed by our way and
[1:51:04] spread his skirt over the top of us and
[1:51:07] covered our nakedness.
[1:51:10] Oh my. And covered thy nakedness. Yay. I
[1:51:14] swear unto thee. I swear unto thee, and
[1:51:18] entered into a covenant with thee, saith
[1:51:20] the Lord God. And thou becamest.
[1:51:30] Oh
[1:51:31] my. So now she's old enough for
[1:51:36] love, the marriageable
[1:51:40] age. So he spreads his
[1:51:43] skirt over
[1:51:45] her and betro her to himself. Remember
[1:51:48] in the book of Ruth chapter 2 of chapter
[1:51:51] 3 rather verse 8. And it came to pass as
[1:51:53] midnight that the man was afraid, and he
[1:51:56] turned himself. And behold, a woman lay
[1:51:58] at his feet, and he said, "Who art
[1:52:00] thou?" And she answered, "I am
[1:52:02] Ruth, thine headmade. Spread
[1:52:06] therefore thy
[1:52:09] skirt over thine
[1:52:11] handmmaid, for thou
[1:52:14] art a near kinsman."
[1:52:17] Wow.
[1:52:19] So Naomi gave her instruction that day
[1:52:21] before she left. She said, "Listen,
[1:52:24] girl. It's time for you to take your
[1:52:26] morning clothes off. Not m o r n i n g,
[1:52:31] but m o u r n i n g." Cuz her husband
[1:52:35] was dead and they would wear them for
[1:52:37] years. So a man would look at a widow
[1:52:40] and know that she could not be married
[1:52:42] for a while until she took them clothes
[1:52:45] off. But you imagine Naomi said, "If
[1:52:47] you're going to go to him, you're going
[1:52:49] to have to present yourself in the right
[1:52:52] way. Don't go mourning." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:52:56] You've got to change the way you think
[1:52:59] about yourself. Oh, yeah. If you're
[1:53:02] going to marry this man, you've got to
[1:53:05] present yourself as a marriageable
[1:53:08] woman. Get them wid clothes off. In
[1:53:12] other words, devil, we're through.
[1:53:17] Hallelujah. I ain't yours no more,
[1:53:20] devil. I'm tired of you. I'm tired of
[1:53:23] what you've done to me. I'm going to my
[1:53:26] Boaz and I'm going to present myself as
[1:53:29] a marriageable woman.
[1:53:34] So you imagine Boaz wakes up. He said,
[1:53:36] "What in the world?" He's, you know,
[1:53:37] coming out of the He said, "What in the
[1:53:39] world is a woman?" And he said, "Oh Lord
[1:53:41] God, what in the world? How in the world
[1:53:43] did this happen? There wasn't a woman
[1:53:44] there when I laid down. Little Ruth
[1:53:47] says, "Spread your skirt over
[1:53:51] me, for you are a near
[1:53:55] kinsman. Ask me to marry you and I will
[1:53:59] say
[1:54:01] yes." Now, sisters, don't you do that.
[1:54:12] Oh my. Spread
[1:54:16] therefore. Don't you understand why our
[1:54:18] Lord
[1:54:20] Jesus had to become a
[1:54:24] man? The
[1:54:25] logos couldn't wear a skirt that would
[1:54:29] be
[1:54:30] spreadable over
[1:54:32] humans. So the Lord God put on a tent.
[1:54:36] And the bottom part of the tent had a
[1:54:40] flap. so he could take his bride. And as
[1:54:43] a matter of fact, when you go to look at
[1:54:44] the tabernacle that was built, and it's
[1:54:46] really odd in the way that God gave the
[1:54:48] direction to Moses and he told him to
[1:54:50] make it longer in the rectangular form,
[1:54:51] then actually it would be needed. And
[1:54:53] then what they would do, they would take
[1:54:54] and turn the flaps back around this way,
[1:54:57] which I've set up tents many time. We
[1:54:58] never set one up this way. But God was
[1:55:01] typifying what was it? The north side.
[1:55:04] The north side. That's the side Satan
[1:55:05] wanted. And they wrapped the back part
[1:55:08] of it around where the Shikana was at.
[1:55:10] And they wrapped it around on the
[1:55:12] outside and it interwoven together and
[1:55:15] they sealed it on that back and there
[1:55:17] the presence of God was. And God had to
[1:55:20] become a man with a tent. And there he
[1:55:24] was at the cross. Eli
[1:55:27] Eli
[1:55:33] lay. and he spread his
[1:55:36] tent over his
[1:55:45] roof. But the question
[1:55:48] is, will that tent be on
[1:55:52] you when he comes?
[1:56:01] Ezekiel
[1:56:03] 16:8, "When I passed by thee, and looked
[1:56:06] upon thee, behold, thy
[1:56:08] time was a time of love. And I spread my
[1:56:12] skirt over thee, and covered thy
[1:56:14] nakedness. Yay, I swear unto thee, and
[1:56:18] entered into a covenant with thee, saith
[1:56:20] the Lord God, thou becamestine."
[1:56:27] So notice in Exodus
[1:56:29] 34:27, and the Lord said unto Moses,
[1:56:32] write these
[1:56:33] words, after the
[1:56:36] tenor of these words, I have made a
[1:56:39] covenant with thee and with Israel. Now,
[1:56:42] where's this at? Mount
[1:56:45] Si. So the tent was spread over him, his
[1:56:48] tent of love, his protection. He sent a
[1:56:51] mighty eagle down the land of Egypt and
[1:56:53] covered them and brought them out. Now
[1:56:57] he brings them to Sinai and he says,
[1:56:59] "Will you all be my wife?" They said,
[1:57:02] "Yes, Lord God, we
[1:57:05] will. Whatever you want us to do, it
[1:57:08] don't matter what it
[1:57:11] is." Easy to say.
[1:57:18] I married my first couple when I was 18
[1:57:21] years
[1:57:22] old. The groom had been sick in the
[1:57:27] hospital. The wedding was on the outside
[1:57:29] in a hot summer day. So I'm standing
[1:57:32] there. He's just a kid marrying two
[1:57:35] other kids
[1:57:37] basically. And I noticed
[1:57:41] him and I thought, "Oh my goodness."
[1:57:45] Well, in a few seconds he was laying on
[1:57:47] the
[1:57:51] ground. Way the marriage ended up, I
[1:57:54] don't know, it might have been the right
[1:57:54] thing for him. I'm just saying, you
[1:57:59] know, I have married so many since
[1:58:03] then. And I will listen to them as they
[1:58:06] will say their vows.
[1:58:09] I Donnie take thee Carol to be my lawful
[1:58:13] wedded wife to heaven and to whole from
[1:58:16] this day forward for better for worse
[1:58:20] for richer for poor in sickness and in
[1:58:24] health. Now Carol will you say the same?
[1:58:27] I Carol take thee Donnie to be my lawful
[1:58:30] witted husband to heaven to hold from
[1:58:32] this day forward for better or for
[1:58:34] worse. It's amazing how fast we can say
[1:58:37] that.
[1:58:40] But then when worse comes
[1:58:43] we're looking for somebody else better.
[1:58:47] That wasn't what you said.
[1:58:50] And that's the way a lot of people come
[1:58:51] to Jesus.
[1:58:54] Oh, you give me eternal life. I do. I
[1:58:56] give you eternal life. Oh, I want it. I
[1:58:57] want it. I don't want to go to hell. I
[1:58:59] don't want to be lost. Yes. Yes. Yes. I
[1:59:01] take it. I take it. What else? I've got
[1:59:03] healing. I've got miracles. I've got
[1:59:05] virtue. I've got salvation. Well, of
[1:59:07] course I want it. I want it
[1:59:12] all. And he says, um, you got to quit
[1:59:16] cutting your hair.
[1:59:21] What? Yeah. That that music that you're
[1:59:23] listening to, all that old country stuff
[1:59:26] and all the rock and roll stuff, it
[1:59:27] ain't nothing but one affair after
[1:59:28] another. What do you think that's doing
[1:59:30] in your heart? Why, that don't make no
[1:59:32] difference. Now, wait a minute. Wait a
[1:59:32] minute. I thought you was going to be my
[1:59:34] wife.
[1:59:40] I wonder when we stand before the
[1:59:44] Lord out of the thousands times
[1:59:48] thousands in this age that say they
[1:59:50] believe this
[1:59:52] word. Wonder how
[1:59:54] many there will actually be.
[2:00:00] And the sad part about it is they will
[2:00:02] stand before God and his
[2:00:07] paronym. They will not be in the rapture
[2:00:09] of course unless their
[2:00:14] wife. They will be raised at the end of
[2:00:17] the
[2:00:18] millennium and brought before the white
[2:00:21] throne. The judgment will be set. Their
[2:00:24] book will be open. Which means all their
[2:00:27] deeds that they did in their unbelief.
[2:00:30] Well, I don't believe that and I don't
[2:00:32] believe that and I don't think that
[2:00:32] matters anymore and I don't think that
[2:00:34] matters. All that's been kept in a
[2:00:35] record against you, against me.
[2:00:40] Then when we walk up there, thou will
[2:00:42] send the paran, thou will send the
[2:00:44] pastor that tried to lead you, the
[2:00:46] evangelist that God used to speak to you
[2:00:48] when nobody but you and God knew what
[2:00:50] you was going through. And God anointed
[2:00:51] a man to say something and you knew it's
[2:00:54] directly to you and yet you walked right
[2:00:57] out of there and done exactly what you
[2:00:59] wanted to do anyway. And that's wrote
[2:01:01] down in
[2:01:07] heaven. God have mercy on
[2:01:11] us children. We've come too far to start
[2:01:16] playing
[2:01:19] church. How many wants to be more
[2:01:21] consecrated than you've ever been before
[2:01:24] all of your
[2:01:26] lives? Do you still have that honeymoon
[2:01:29] love?
[2:01:34] I sent a little love text to my darling
[2:01:37] wife
[2:01:38] today and I said, 'I want you to know,
[2:01:40] my
[2:01:41] darling, I love you so
[2:01:43] much and you are the
[2:01:46] queen of my heart. Absolutely.
[2:01:51] Well, I don't text Jesus, but I talk to
[2:01:54] him daily
[2:01:56] and nightly sometimes when I can't
[2:01:57] sleep,
[2:01:58] too. Just letting him know. And
[2:02:02] sometimes I do this on purpose. I don't
[2:02:05] mention you
[2:02:06] all. I don't mention the sick in our
[2:02:08] church. I don't mention the sick that I
[2:02:10] know around the world. I bring no
[2:02:14] request. I just go to talk to him
[2:02:18] and just say,
[2:02:20] "I didn't come
[2:02:23] here to ask you for anything.
[2:02:29] I just came to
[2:02:32] talk with you,
[2:02:36] Lord. You've
[2:02:38] answered a million prayers or more that
[2:02:44] I forgot to thank you
[2:02:47] for.
[2:02:49] I just came to talk with you, Lord.
[2:02:57] Maybe
[2:02:59] tomorrow there will be
[2:03:02] trouble and
[2:03:04] sorrow and a
[2:03:07] thousand
[2:03:09] teardrops may
[2:03:12] fall. But
[2:03:14] until I face tomorrow's
[2:03:17] task, I have
[2:03:20] no special favors to ask.
[2:03:26] I just came to
[2:03:29] talk with you, Lord.
[2:03:33] You ever go to him that way? Or do you
[2:03:36] always have your wish list and your want
[2:03:40] list? There's an appropriate time for
[2:03:42] your list. But I wonder how we make him
[2:03:45] feel sometimes when the only time we go
[2:03:47] to prayer. I need this. I need that. I
[2:03:50] want that. my nephew, my uncle, my
[2:03:52] cousin, my brother, my sister-in-law, my
[2:03:54] father-in-law, you know, uncle so and so
[2:03:56] and so and so, how would you feel? If
[2:03:59] every time somebody come to you, they
[2:04:02] always wanted
[2:04:05] something. So when he answers those
[2:04:07] prayers, do you go back to him and say,
[2:04:10] "Oh yeah, I want to check this off,
[2:04:11] check that off, check that off, check
[2:04:13] that off, check that off. Thank you.
[2:04:15] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[2:04:16] you."
[2:04:19] or do we just come back with more
[2:04:20] requests?
[2:04:23] Think of it, friends. Do we still love
[2:04:26] Jesus with the
[2:04:28] honeymoon
[2:04:30] love? Or are now we an old married
[2:04:34] couple and we're grouchy and contrary
[2:04:37] and well, we are. He He isn't, but we're
[2:04:39] grouchy and contrary and you know, we
[2:04:41] don't like this and we don't like that
[2:04:42] and we complain over this and that and
[2:04:44] the other and well, I didn't get this
[2:04:45] out of church and I didn't get that out
[2:04:47] of church. And he said, "I remember the
[2:04:48] days of your youth when you was just so
[2:04:51] happy to be there. You were so happy."
[2:04:58] Bring us back, Lord.
[2:05:02] Can we bow our
[2:05:06] heads? God told them, "Thou beamest
[2:05:10] mine." And then he says, "Turn, oh
[2:05:13] backsliding children, saith the Lord,
[2:05:17] for I am
[2:05:19] married unto
[2:05:23] you." Now, let's not take our shovel, as
[2:05:27] it were, and say, "Boy, I'll tell you
[2:05:29] one thing. Oh, brother so and so sure
[2:05:31] needed that tonight, and sister so and
[2:05:33] so needed that, and boy, I'll tell you
[2:05:35] this and that and the other. Boy, praise
[2:05:38] God. I hope God really dealt with them.
[2:05:40] Let's Let's not think about them so much
[2:05:43] right now. Let's think about
[2:05:47] us. I want the Lord God to start with me
[2:05:50] first
[2:05:51] off and search
[2:05:53] me. Look at me. Look at
[2:05:58] you. Let us see is our love the
[2:06:00] honeymoon
[2:06:02] love. I study people and it's amazing.
[2:06:05] and you go out to eat Cracker Barrel
[2:06:06] wherever you go. You can tell people
[2:06:08] it's been married a long time cuz after
[2:06:10] they place their order, he looks one way
[2:06:12] and she looks the other and they sat
[2:06:13] there and they don't hardly talk and
[2:06:15] they just sat there. Either that or
[2:06:17] they're on their phones. They're more
[2:06:18] addicted to their phones than they are
[2:06:19] to one another, which is an absolute
[2:06:22] shame. Brother Fred Mullins's my dear
[2:06:25] friend. They've got a little rule at
[2:06:28] their house. When all the grandkids and
[2:06:30] all the family comes over to eat,
[2:06:33] they've got a basket. Everybody's cell
[2:06:36] phone goes in the basket and they talk
[2:06:39] to one
[2:06:40] another. Wow. That's a lose. That's a
[2:06:43] lost trade, isn't it? Being able to
[2:06:46] talk. Oh my. Can we just bow our heads
[2:06:49] together? I I just
[2:06:51] wonder how
[2:06:53] many how many of you
[2:06:56] want want to be closer to him than
[2:06:58] you've ever
[2:07:00] been. Look friends, apparently somebody
[2:07:03] here tonight, more than one somebody I
[2:07:06] figure is at the marriageable
[2:07:09] age and either somebody present or
[2:07:12] somebody streaming or somebody that'll
[2:07:14] stream it tomorrow.
[2:07:17] You're fixing to be
[2:07:18] faced with a terrible, terrible
[2:07:22] thing. Be
[2:07:27] careful. Oh
[2:07:30] my, Lord
[2:07:36] Jesus. Lord, this this service went so
[2:07:39] different than what I thought it would
[2:07:42] go. as I was studying these things and I
[2:07:45] I just I thought in my mind of a
[2:07:48] direction that it would wind up going,
[2:07:50] but it's went so different
[2:07:53] tonight. But you know the way it needs
[2:07:55] to go, not
[2:07:57] me. So Lord, I don't want you I don't
[2:08:00] want you to begin with Brother Daryl. I
[2:08:02] don't want you to begin with the deacons
[2:08:04] or the trustee brothers or the musicians
[2:08:07] on the
[2:08:09] platform, but begin with me, Lord.
[2:08:14] Look at
[2:08:15] me. Put me under your great MRI, your
[2:08:19] great CT, all your great scan of your
[2:08:21] word. See if there's anything in me,
[2:08:24] Lord, that displeases
[2:08:26] you. Any
[2:08:28] attitude, anything about me, Lord, any
[2:08:31] doctrine, anything, please,
[2:08:34] Lord. Oh Jesus, I love you, Lord. You
[2:08:39] know my heart.
[2:08:42] Oh God, I pray for the young, the old,
[2:08:44] the middle-aged, some here, Father, been
[2:08:46] saved for
[2:08:48] decades. I'm sure probably many of them
[2:08:50] like me tonight. They never wanted to be
[2:08:53] old and cold and
[2:08:56] indifferent. Oh Jesus, help us. May the
[2:09:00] spirit of God move across this place
[2:09:02] tonight. Father, for the visitors that's
[2:09:05] in our gates, Father, may you minister
[2:09:08] to them as well. those that will stream
[2:09:09] the service, those that'll archive it.
[2:09:12] Father, oh
[2:09:14] Jesus, may we fall in love with you all
[2:09:19] over
[2:09:21] again. Let us know you as never
[2:09:26] before. Oh
[2:09:28] Jesus, I'm reminded of what you told the
[2:09:31] Ephesian age. I have somewhat against
[2:09:34] you because you have left.
[2:09:38] I know people quote it lost, but that's
[2:09:42] not what the Bible says. The Bible says
[2:09:46] left. When we lose something, more than
[2:09:48] likely, we don't know where it is, but
[2:09:51] they left
[2:09:53] it. So, they didn't lose it, not knowing
[2:09:56] where it was. They left it and had an
[2:09:59] idea of where they left it
[2:10:01] at. I have somewhat against you because
[2:10:04] you have left your first love.
[2:10:07] Oh Jesus, may you move on each of our
[2:10:10] hearts tonight. Father, I
[2:10:13] pray just for a few moments. Lord, we
[2:10:15] have great needs here. Requests laying
[2:10:17] here before me, Father. Lord, different
[2:10:20] ones in our church have great
[2:10:23] needs. But Lord, just for a moment, we
[2:10:25] want to
[2:10:27] just hold on them for for just a few
[2:10:31] moments and say, "Lord God, our
[2:10:34] needs, our needs for our soul, our needs
[2:10:37] for our walk, our needs for our passion,
[2:10:41] our desire.
[2:10:43] Oh, if we could be as passionate about
[2:10:45] you as we are about sports and we are
[2:10:48] about hunting and we are about making
[2:10:51] money and oh my people get so excited
[2:10:54] over this and that and the other and yet
[2:10:56] when it comes to church the least little
[2:10:59] thing discourages them from come to the
[2:11:01] house of
[2:11:03] God. why they're not as passionate about
[2:11:06] it as they are going to the lake or
[2:11:10] going to Dollywood or going here, there,
[2:11:12] there. It's amazing. They get a
[2:11:14] headache, they won't come to church, but
[2:11:16] they'll take a Tylenol and go ahead and
[2:11:17] go to Dollywood. Don't make no sense to
[2:11:20] me since it's an hour and 40 minute
[2:11:22] drive down there and an hour and 40
[2:11:24] minute back. They're going to have to
[2:11:25] stand in line in the hot sun and then
[2:11:27] come in here and air condition it.
[2:11:30] The problem is their love life.
[2:11:34] Israel had got to that place. The love
[2:11:37] life had gone
[2:11:39] cold. Oh Jesus, we love you tonight.
[2:11:44] Father, we worship
[2:11:48] you. Hallelujah.
[2:11:51] Lord, anybody here tonight beside me
[2:11:55] like to just have your love renewed with
[2:11:58] the Lord Jesus? Would you raise your
[2:11:59] hands?
[2:12:02] the majority of the audience that I can
[2:12:05] see. So, would you do me a favor? Would
[2:12:08] you turn and lay your hand on that
[2:12:10] person standing there by
[2:12:11] you? They wanted their love renewed with
[2:12:16] Jesus. They don't necessarily need to be
[2:12:18] saved again. It don't necessarily mean
[2:12:20] that they need the Holy Ghost
[2:12:22] again, but they just it just don't feel
[2:12:26] right. You husbands and wives
[2:12:29] know you have a little disagreement. You
[2:12:31] have some words between you and you can
[2:12:34] still say I love you and still hug her
[2:12:36] and all that same thing, but somehow it
[2:12:40] just don't feel right between you. You
[2:12:42] know, it can become that same way with
[2:12:44] Jesus. We still go through the motion.
[2:12:47] We still go to church and we still read
[2:12:49] our Bible, listen to tapes on the
[2:12:52] occasion, but it just don't feel
[2:12:55] right.
[2:12:57] Hallelujah. Brother Daryl, would you
[2:12:59] come up, my brother? Pray for the
[2:13:03] people. Now remember, you're praying for
[2:13:07] them and they're praying for
[2:13:11] you. Brother Daryl, would you pray for
[2:13:13] me as you're praying for the people?
[2:13:19] Heavenly Father, oh dear Jesus, Lord, we
[2:13:23] are so grateful in our hearts tonight,
[2:13:25] Lord. Oh Lord God, I pray as I was
[2:13:28] thinking, Lord, the prophet of God said
[2:13:32] God loves you because he sent me to tell
[2:13:34] you the truth. And oh God, tonight we we
[2:13:37] know that you love us, Lord, because you
[2:13:39] have sent brother Donnie to tell us the
[2:13:41] truth.
[2:13:42] Oh God, we pray father as we lay hands
[2:13:45] on one another that we would fall deeper
[2:13:46] in love with you Lord Jesus that our
[2:13:49] lives would be focused upon you Lord and
[2:13:51] the the will of your word for our lives
[2:13:54] dear God we pray may we lay aside Lord
[2:13:57] every way every feather Lord every ideal
[2:13:59] that would be contrary to your word Lord
[2:14:02] that we hear you say that day well done
[2:14:05] thy good and faithful servant Lord I
[2:14:07] pray for my brothers and my sisters
[2:14:09] tonight dear God I pray for this body of
[2:14:12] believers around the world, dear God, as
[2:14:14] we see, Lord, the signs of your
[2:14:16] prophecies, Lord, being fulfilled before
[2:14:18] our very eyes. May it be a time of
[2:14:20] reconsecration and a time of
[2:14:22] rededication of our lives to you, Lord,
[2:14:24] that we would lay aside the things, dear
[2:14:27] God, that does not really matter, Lord,
[2:14:28] and strive for that thing which is
[2:14:30] eternal, dear God. I pray for my brother
[2:14:33] and my sisters tonight, Lord. That our
[2:14:35] decisions would be pleasing to you,
[2:14:37] Lord. That our walk and our life would
[2:14:39] be pleasing to you, Lord. Oh God, bring
[2:14:41] back the new again, Lord, upon the
[2:14:43] hearts of your people, dear God. Stir,
[2:14:45] dear God, that stir of a revival in our
[2:14:48] souls again, Lord, that our lives would
[2:14:50] thirst, dear God, for the reality of
[2:14:52] your word, Lord. That we would not seek
[2:14:54] after a sensation, Lord, or a sign, but
[2:14:57] we would seek after the reality of your
[2:14:59] word, Lord, that the word of God would
[2:15:01] not just be in print, Lord, but it would
[2:15:03] be a living word manifested in our
[2:15:05] lives, dear God. We pray tonight, Lord.
[2:15:08] I pray for brother Donnie, Lord, as he
[2:15:10] lays hands upon me and we lay hands upon
[2:15:12] one another, Lord. May these prayers,
[2:15:14] God, may it be unto thy ears, oh Lord,
[2:15:16] that we would hear our cry to you, Lord,
[2:15:19] for we know that you are the God who
[2:15:20] answers back, dear God. And I pray
[2:15:23] today, Lord Jesus, that you'd hear our
[2:15:25] prayer, Lord, as we offer it unto you
[2:15:27] from a sincere heart, dear God, from a
[2:15:30] broken heart, Lord, who has heard your
[2:15:32] word tonight, Lord. And God, we identify
[2:15:34] with it, Lord. And this is our desire,
[2:15:37] dear God. For Lord, you found us here in
[2:15:39] these in the naked and blind and
[2:15:42] wretched and bored. And you have clothed
[2:15:43] us, dear God, in the righteousness of
[2:15:46] the message of this hour, Lord. But oh
[2:15:48] God, may it not just be clothed on the
[2:15:50] outside, but on the inside, Lord, living
[2:15:52] out, Lord, that others may see the
[2:15:55] reality of your word, Lord. We commit
[2:15:57] oursel into your hands tonight. Father,
[2:15:59] bring back the new again, Lord. Bring
[2:16:01] back that that honeymoon as our brother
[2:16:04] has preached tonight. Lord, bring back
[2:16:06] that feeling among us, dear God. We
[2:16:08] pray, Lord, that our greatest desire,
[2:16:10] Lord, would be to serve you, Lord, that
[2:16:13] our greatest desire would be to please
[2:16:15] you, Lord. Grant it tonight, Lord, as we
[2:16:18] commit these things into your hands for
[2:16:19] your glory. We ask these things in Jesus
[2:16:22] name we pray. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:16:24] Amen and amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:16:26] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord
[2:16:29] Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:16:33] Hallelujah.
[2:16:36] Hallelujah.
[2:16:42] Brother JD brought this prayer request
[2:16:44] up. Please pray for Jude and Sydney.
[2:16:46] Both are sick and they're sending Sydney
[2:16:49] to the ER to be checked for sepsis. This
[2:16:53] is Justin's wife and little boy.
[2:16:57] I know there's others in the church
[2:16:58] that's sick. Can we just take them there
[2:17:01] for the Lord? Jude and Sydney also.
[2:17:04] Brother Steve
[2:17:07] Newsome, others who have a request on
[2:17:09] your heart, would you just raise it
[2:17:11] there to
[2:17:12] God? Amen. Brother Mike Lunsford had to
[2:17:16] go today and we're going to do a a heart
[2:17:20] procedure on him on Friday. I know our
[2:17:22] brother would appreciate the prayers. I
[2:17:24] know there's others that have
[2:17:26] needs. Now we've asked him to help us.
[2:17:30] Now let's spring our
[2:17:32] petitions. Lord Jesus,
[2:17:35] your prophet gave us the way that we
[2:17:37] should pray.
[2:17:39] That was that we begin with worship.
[2:17:41] God, we start talking to you and just
[2:17:44] loving you and worshiping you. Then we
[2:17:46] bring our petitions.
[2:17:48] Father, you see Sydney and Jude, Lord.
[2:17:52] Dear God, we pray that you just move for
[2:17:54] him tonight. Father, you see them send
[2:17:57] in Sydney, Lord, to for further testing
[2:18:00] to see if she might have this sepsis. We
[2:18:02] know it's a terrible thing. Lord, in the
[2:18:05] name of Jesus, would you move for them
[2:18:08] both tonight, Lord? Dear God, we're also
[2:18:11] praying, Father, for our brother
[2:18:14] Maurice. We know, Lord, that his wife
[2:18:16] had to take him in.
[2:18:18] Lord, I I heard from him right before
[2:18:20] service and he's feeling some better but
[2:18:23] still not well. We pray for him tonight.
[2:18:25] Father, we pray for brother Steve
[2:18:27] Newsome, Lord Jesus, and his family.
[2:18:30] Dear God, you see the battle that our
[2:18:32] brother is in. And we're praying the
[2:18:34] hand of God. We just move for him
[2:18:37] tonight in the name of Jesus. We pray
[2:18:39] for his wife. We pray for his children.
[2:18:42] Lord, we know those of us that have been
[2:18:44] down a similar path, how difficult to do
[2:18:48] seeing your loved one that's in pain and
[2:18:50] sickness and can't eat and all that sort
[2:18:52] of thing. May the angel of God go by
[2:18:55] their home tonight, Father, in the name
[2:18:58] of Jesus. May the spirit of God move for
[2:19:02] them. Lord God made made something
[2:19:05] similar happen to us tonight that
[2:19:08] happened to Isaiah the prophet that day
[2:19:11] when he went before the presence of God
[2:19:14] and the voice said, "Who can I send? Who
[2:19:21] will go before me?" And after the angel
[2:19:24] of God came and touched his lips with
[2:19:28] the coals of fire, then the prophet
[2:19:31] said, "Here am I. Send me." Lord, may
[2:19:36] your coals of fire not only touch our
[2:19:39] lips, but purge our hearts, our souls.
[2:19:42] If there's anything in us that you find
[2:19:45] displeasing to you, Lord, then we can
[2:19:49] say also, "Here we are. Send us
[2:19:53] Lord.
[2:19:55] Hallelujah. We worship you tonight oh
[2:19:58] God in the name of Jesus. Minister to
[2:20:02] the needs of your people tonight. Oh
[2:20:04] father. Praise your holy name Lord. We
[2:20:08] worship you Lord
[2:20:11] Jesus.
[2:20:17] Amazing
[2:20:19] grace, how
[2:20:22] sweet the sound. Everybody now that
[2:20:29] save a
[2:20:32] wretch like
[2:20:36] me. Hallelujah.
[2:20:39] I
[2:20:41] once was
[2:20:44] lost, but
[2:20:47] now I'm
[2:20:50] found. I was
[2:20:52] blind, but
[2:20:55] now I can
[2:21:01] see. Oh, praise God. Let's raise our
[2:21:05] hands now as we sing it. Let's praise
[2:21:08] him. Let's worship him. Let's make love
[2:21:11] to him now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:21:15] Remember the days of your youth.
[2:21:18] Remember the days of your espouses to
[2:21:21] the king. When those tears run down your
[2:21:24] cheeks when church seemed so short. Oh,
[2:21:28] you just wanted them to preach longer
[2:21:30] and pray longer and sing
[2:21:32] longer. May God renew us tonight.
[2:21:35] refresh us in his
[2:21:39] presence.
[2:21:40] Hallelujah. Praise
[2:21:43] God. Praise
[2:21:46] God. When we've been there.
[2:21:49] Oh, when
[2:21:52] we been
[2:21:55] there
[2:21:59] 10,000
[2:22:01] years, bright
[2:22:06] shine
[2:22:08] as the sun.
[2:22:12] Oh yes, Lord. We've
[2:22:16] no less
[2:22:19] days to
[2:22:22] sing of God's
[2:22:25] praise than
[2:22:29] when we
[2:22:32] first
[2:22:35] beun. Let's pick it up a little bit now.
[2:22:37] When the battle's over. When the
[2:22:40] battle's
[2:22:42] over, we shall wear a crown a little
[2:22:45] faster. Oh, we shall wear a crown. Oh,
[2:22:49] we shall wear a crown. Oh, when the
[2:22:54] battle's

[2:25:14] Lord, for your mercy never fails. fails
[2:25:19] me. All my
[2:25:22] days I've been held in your
[2:25:27] hands. From the moment that I wake
[2:25:31] up until I lay my
[2:25:35] head, I will
[2:25:38] sing of the
[2:25:40] goodness of God.
[2:25:44] [Music]
[2:25:46] All my life you have been
[2:25:53] faithful. All my life you have been so
[2:25:59] so
[2:26:01] good. With every breath that I am
[2:26:07] able. Oh, I will
[2:26:09] sing of the
[2:26:12] goodness of
[2:26:14] God. I love your
[2:26:19] voice. You have led me through the
[2:26:24] fire in darkest
[2:26:27] night. You are close like no
[2:26:32] other. I've known you as a
[2:26:36] father. I've known you as a friend.
[2:26:41] And I have lived in the
[2:26:45] goodness of
[2:26:50] God. All my life you have been
[2:26:58] faithful. All my life you have been so
[2:27:03] so good.
[2:27:07] With every breath that I am
[2:27:11] able, oh I will
[2:27:14] sing of the
[2:27:16] goodness of
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:22] God. All my life you have been faithful.
[2:27:30] Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus. Life
[2:27:32] you have been so so good.
