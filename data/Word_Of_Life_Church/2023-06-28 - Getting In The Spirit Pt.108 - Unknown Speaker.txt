if you would the book of First Corinthians chapter 3. certainly greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus what a privilege it is for us to be gathered together tonight everybody feeling the pressure for our meeting coming up this week that's why I thought I'd bring just a little simple joyful sermon tonight to help everybody well y'all doing laughing like that come on people my goodness First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. we're coming with great anticipation see what the Lord's going to do for us and speak to us and change lives and heal the sick not only in their bodies but in their spirits and their souls wherever they need healing we serve a mighty God don't we let's consult tonight again with the master builder for other Foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation what Foundation Jesus Christ gold silver precious stones wood hey stubble how shameful that anybody would want to lay stubble on Jesus hey on Jesus Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try Every Man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss that he himself shall be saved yet so as by far saved but without a reward saved but without a reward I don't want to stand that way do you know no I I don't want to do things for the sake of reward but I want to do what I can do to be able to bring it and lay it at his feet it's not that you and I are worthy of any reward anyway because when it's all said and done says the parable that Jesus said we would say that we were unworthy servants but we do it because he is worthy I made like to be remembered tonight as we pray as we look into the word God bless you me too let's just pray together Heavenly Father we realize as we stand here in your presence before these people each of us one day are going to be called before that great high place as Christians we will not go through the white throne but as bride we will come up and give an account and we will answer according to the book the book of remembrance so father I pray that you would help each of us that whenever we stand there will be so many things that you have helped us to accomplish for your kingdom not for us not for a name we don't do it for reward we don't do it for back payment Lord we do it because we love you help us father that we can open our hearts tonight to your word and Lord you see we're under great anticipation of the meetings coming up this week and we're just praying for brother Tim on Friday brother Ron on Saturday by the David on Sunday or those that will be traveling in from all over just pray that you'll watch over them and give us a great time together Lord as we come to Fellowship around your word we ask it tonight father in the name of Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated what a great thing Godly works are what a great thing to be attributed to a changed life we know that works are so important both in the direction of light and the direction of Darkness Jesus gives us the astounding parable and tells us that the Kingdom of Heaven shall be likened to a man when he's going to divide the sheep from the goats and they will stand there as she not actually sheep but as sheep and he puts forth this profound parallel when he'll say you didn't take care of me when I was hungry I was in the hospitals we'd say I was sick I was home I was weary you never even come and saw me I was hungry you never fed me I was naked and you never give me any clothes and they'll say Lord when did we ever see you like that well I never lived in your day I lived in 2020 I lived in 1900 I lived in 1800 I I never saw you he said when you didn't do this to the least of these my brothers you didn't do it to me and then those that are as sheep or not sheep because sheep don't stand there he will turn right around and say enter into the joys of the Lord because I was hungry and you fed me they said what well we never saw you I was naked and you closed me I was this and you did that I was this and you did that Lord when did we see you like that I never lived in your day when you did it to the least of these my brothers now what you notice that Jesus separates these people from Brothers these people who had done this were not actually brothers but he said they treated his brothers that way now look at what a great thing it is in the eyes of God in the way that we treat his brothers so there will be people that will actually be turned into hell if you notice Jesus doesn't say you laughed at my name you laughed whenever you heard that I healed the sick you ridicule whenever you heard somebody speaking in tongues but Jesus said because of the way you treated my brothers you are lost and then to the other group he'll say well you believe John 3 16 and you you believed in shouting and you believed in jumping and you believed in signs and wonders no simply because of the way they treated his brothers so myself as I look at that I realize that it's not just important how them people treat his brothers but also how important it is for his brothers to treat his brothers amen his sisters to treat his sisters so God always has been identified in the reality of lives being changed and we can see that even in the Old Testament before the New Birth Jacob Moses so many and their lives were touched by the power of God and were changed and the New Testament certainly does not end that effect of good works but it ties from the old to the new so every one of us now not just the older people like me and your moms and your dads but you young people when you stand before the Lord you will walk before him and there will be the book open and there will be another book open which is The Book of Life now every one of us have books that are going to be identified with who we are now if our name is in that that special section of the Lamb's Book of Life our name can never be removed under any circumstances at all but then there there's another book which is the record of our Deeds now in that is what we're talking about tonight turn with me if you would to Matthew or Malachi rather chapter 3 verse 16. Malachi 3 16. then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them now listen why this book is written and a book of remembrance was written before him for them now it's written before him but it's written on your behalf that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name so now this is how important that it is to God that we just remember his name so when we're going through things of Life hardships difficulties trials whatever it is and we just remember that the name of the Lord is a strong tower and we just think about him in the time of distress that is actually written in the book of remembrance under your name now that's just when you think about it and whenever you remember him and remember how good he is and how wonderful he is much less whenever you act upon it and say he is mindful he will help me in the midst of trouble he will do this and that and the other you imagine all of that is written how many things was written about us today this very day in the book of remembrance when Satan tempted you when Satan come at you and Satan tried to make you doubt God won't move for you but the first thing you've done in your mind you remember but wait a minute the Lord has always been mindful of me he's been merciful so merciful to me all the days of my life now not only to do something inside of your soul but there was writing taking place in heaven because you sought upon the goodness of God and you remembered his name and remembered his power is it any wonder that Satan does not want us to think that way then that he wants to get us so called up in the things of life and trouble and heartaches and sadness and the Darkness of the world why sure I don't blame him but if I was the devil I'd be doing you all the exact same way so I say we need to do it more than we've ever done you believe that now notice then so a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name now notice what they do they remember the Lord and they think about him and they feared the Lord and they fought upon his name now look at verse 17 the promise that God makes to those people and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels now listen while God identifies this class of people that are living on the earth they are God's special treasures and God identifies them as precious objects of his love and his mercy and his great devotion towards Humanity that God looks at these people now think how outstanding it is to God whenever we think about him this is what God Said now not just the length of your hair sisters the length of your dress and your brothers don't wear dresses and you don't paint up your face and you're not that weird classic out here but whenever you do simple things like thinking on the Lord that puts you in a treasure class of people notice what God said they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts notice the way Malachi writes this and he puts the word host in the plurality form so it's host as in plural remember Jacob had an experience with the Lord of hosts himself one time and he called it by a special name mayonnaise him mayonnaise him the camp the two camps and Jacob had a revelation from God that God had come down with an Angelic host and he had come with another host and it was the meeting place of the two camps and he calls it may a nahim the Gathering of the two camps so hear God being identified as the Lord of hosts he's not just the lord of the Angelic host but he's the lord of the Earthly host who sank upon his name who bless his name who worship Him who live for him now notice what God Said in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that service him what a blessing it is it to us as the people of God that God would look at us now these are works that we're not doing for brothers and sisters but we're doing this directly to God so when you're in trouble and you think about him and that very thought so simple to us well who would think that God in his great infinite wisdom and all the things that God has got going on but when you're under an onslaught of hell and whenever you simply allow your mind to think about the goodness of God Lord God you've been so good to me you have been so wonderful to me and Lord I cannot think of one one time of the Decades of my life that I have served you that you've not always been there every time and you're just thinking about it and encourages you and helps you little did you know the Lord God had them Angelic scribes to write it down in a book now you didn't do it to your brother you did not buy the Widow some cold for the winter winter time you did not buy somebody some groceries or somebody's supper but you were simply thinking about the Lord God and his name and his mercy and it meant so much to him that he said write that down I'm going to add that to Donny's book I'm going to add that to Carol's book and when she stands before me that day there will be page atrophage not of just where she's prayed for people not of just where this man has helped maybe pay somebody's car payment but there will be page at your page of adoration and praise and adornment and thoughts and love and all that that he done for me that she done for me that she thought nobody even knew do you believe friends that every thought that you have toward the goodness of God it means so much to him he will reward you that day when he gathers his jewels I'll tell you one thing it ought to make us want to love him more than we've ever loved him in our life it ought to make us want to give him more than we have ever given him how many agrees with that now think that that means so much to almighty God that he would have a book of remembrance so here in this section is what we do for one another now we know because we're baptized into the mystical Body of Christ that we are members one of the other and even though there will be people among us that will never prophesy some that will never preach some that will never speak in tongues maybe never have dreams or visions or any of that but that does not mean to the Lord Jesus they don't have as much value and he loves them just as much if they never do any of that as he does the greatest Prophet that ever lived on the earth God has the ability to look at his children and they stand before the foot of the cross every one of them on equal basis aren't you glad I'm so glad that he don't love me less because I'm not the great preacher that you're going to hear this weekend now you're fixing to hear some great preachers and we're going to hear some great men of God and we've heard some great men of God and you know I realize I'll never be that kind of man I'm not that type of a caliber of a man but the Lord help me realize years and years ago that he will never hold me accountable for another man's Ministry and he'll never require of me what he gives to this man to that man to another man all he will require of me is what is given to me and I've accepted that a long time ago so I want to be the very best that I can be for what God's given me and he will require no more of me than that I don't want to be anybody else now come on shall I say Amen well you say well I can't hardly do this and I can't do that be the best that God's given you and that's all that God will ever require of you but keep in mind now that when we look at doing something for the Lord and what we're doing in the way of works that God equips each of us and gives us a certain ability to do certain things and God also sets a boundary now the problem is with adoption as it was in the Old Testament so is it in the new that if Ephraim planted corn everybody wanted to plant corn if Judah planted barley everybody wanted to plant barley because there's something about it that it's so much easier for us to look at somebody else's work and think oh they're doing a good way I wish I could do that I wish I could be like that I hear some preachers preaching I think Lord have mercy and what in the world did God pick up his redneck hillbilly out of Kentucky and call him to preach well I couldn't even carry them guys briefcase and here are some of them the way they put this and that and the other together you think Lord what in the world do you even want me for Lord but apparently he wanted me for something because he called me and he gave me the ability to do something so I've learned that Paul said they that compare themselves among themselves are not wise so God calls every one of us and we Minister according to the ability that God gives us and the church says notice now in Acts chapter 9 verse 3 a Saul of Tarsus now is meeting the Lord Jesus and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly they'll shine right about him alike from heaven and he fell to the Earth and Heard a Voice sing unto him Saul Saul white persecute us thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutes now I've been listening to a tape called in his presence in 1962. Kevin heard him all y'all to listen to it's a really good sermon but I've been hearing brother Branham say that Paul did did not believe that God was a man so he could not understand this about Jesus and he couldn't understand about the body because he did not believe that God was a man so he's asking him now this question because he believed God was a light or a pillar of fire and he was right to a degree but he had missed the dispensational change to where that God had condescended from being a light to becoming a man so your Paul simply asked the question of the Lord who are you now watch he must have been overwhelmed when he hears this response I am not the Lord God now notice he does not say I am I don't know he does not say I am that I am now if he would have said that he took him straight back to Moses he'd been looking for a bush to be on fire and he would have thought the fire in the bush was the Lord God but notice how he answers him I am Jesus I am a glorified man now you see what he's fixing to do is open Saul's understanding to a new dispensation now it's going to also merge that into the pause two dispensations behind actually and now he's going to help him to see that God had become a man and now that man have become a church Glory well you see he was way back under thinking that God was still alive and God was a fire but he introduces himself as I am Jesus well now for Paul being a Jew this Jesus of course the way they looked at him naturally was a Jew but he was a blasphemer he was a man so for him to ask the question who are you Lord who are you I don't know I am Jesus now notice I am Jesus whom thou persecutes but yet Paul had never even seen the man Jesus will have no record that he ever saw him so how was Paul persecuting Jesus in the form of his church now think about it the Lord Jesus identified his body as himself so I wonder if the Lord Jesus doesn't do the same thing today that he identifies his body as himself so how does it make him feel if we as members of the body treat other members of the body in a way that does not please the Lord or how does it make the Lord Jesus feel whenever the land of sins will life at the members of his body and whoever it is government officials or whoever more and they will treat the members of his body in a bad way now if they would ask the Lord Jesus currently who are you Lord he'd say I'm in my bride and when you persecute her you persecute me so what an eye-opener that this was so Paul catches it in a twofold way that I am Jesus I I am a man which has now become glorified and I am feeling the hurt of my wife as you are persecuting her I don't mind telling you friend if the people of the world know who they were rubbing shoulders with I think they'd treat us all a lot better I think that if we realize who we're going to church with we would treat one another a lot better too well praise the Lord now notice he said it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks now Paul must have received oh Lord I cannot imagine how this man must have felt when the realization finally hit his soul that whenever he was persecuting this body this must have been overwhelming nothing in the Old Testament had ever even been similar to that at all I'm when he was persecuting the church he was persecuting the Lord Jesus so not as few has totally changed about the mystical Body of Christ so Paul from this point on begins to look at the body of Christ in a total different way than anything he'd ever seen before so it's no wonder that God allowed this man and gave him such inspiration to write about the body as a matter of fact he preaches more about the body of Christ than into the rest of the writers in the New Testament watch him in First Corinthians chapter 16 verse 15. I beseech you bro Brethren you know the house of stephanus that it is the first fruits of akaya and that they have listened this word they hired addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints now I do really believe in addiction it's not the marijuana it ain't to nicotine it ain't to your cell phone but I do believe there is a scriptural addiction now these people notice how Paul frames this that it is the first fruits of ikaya and this was of the House of her brother by the name of stephanus now we don't know too much about this man what they've done but Paul just summed it all together and these beautiful words and said they have addicted themselves to them to the ministry of the Saints I want you to notice how Paul coins these terms now your Paul was a lot like the church AIDS messenger and our day when you go to Rudy studying the Greek words that Paul used there was no secular use of some of these words as a matter of fact Scholars still rub their head and say where to even get some of these words out and they say that Paul actually coined is the term they used that Paul actually coined some of these words because it had been never been used before well I can see that and understand it clearly that never have been a group of people on the Earth like them so God had to give him words like they'd never done before you know brother randomly used the words before that Mr Webster probably strike his head and just scratched his head and say where in the world to get that from well you know Paul then he used this word which is not used anywhere else in the Bible and he identified this particular group this house which was a family and that they had addicted themselves now we all know enough about addiction we're living in a great age of addiction when people get addicted to a substance when they get addicted to whatever it is they absolutely have to have it now they've got to have it uh you know it may start out in the morning and they don't drink it they have to have they have to have their coffee or they get a headache at 11 o'clock if they don't get it well glory to God oh but we know that it can go into the form of drugs and go into the form of this and that but this is the first time that the word was actually used in the Bible and the only time so these Saints had become so addictive but I want you to notice how Paul says when what they were addicted to he said that they have addicted themselves so it wasn't like that they got around the Saints or they got around the ministry because the ministry was actually what they addicted themselves to it was the ministry to the Saints the ministry to the Saints so these folks had got such an understanding that the ministry was so absolutely essential that without the ministry the Saints could not flourish without the ministry the Saints could not grow without the ministry the Saints would never grow spiritually the churches would never become more and more and more well Hallelujah you see they wouldn't like a lot of message folks who didn't think when it didn't need preachers no more but these folks felt like it was so necessary that the ministry but I want you to notice how that Paul terms says that he identifies it the ministry to the Saints so it was not the other way around that the saints were actually the servants to the ministry but the ministry was the servants to the Saints so these people called an understanding of how essential that the ministry was and they addicted themselves to helping the ministry in every way they could so can you imagine what a great thing it must have been so instead of going around and trying to add burdens and load and difficulty and so on to the ministry that they've done everything they could to try to lighten the Lord they would pray for them they would call their name before the Lord they would do everything they could in so much that they become addicted and they said I've got to do something for a preacher I just got to do it I I've got to do it but I've just got to have that fix Lord help me I've got to have it oh my goodness I wonder what kind of message will it really have if we had about a half a dozen that was addicted to this if some of y'all was addicted to this as you are to Facebook my goodness what a church would have if you're as addicted to this I watch some of y'all sometime I watch them dings and buzzes and this and that and the other on your phone and as soon as it goes off yo I don't care you're standing there talking to whoever and you'll grab that phone you're so addicted to that thing you can't let it Buzz one time without it getting your attention I reckon you figure you're that important huh are you that important that Biden contacts you every day asks you for counsel and advice come on get real get next to yourself you ain't nothing but a six foot pile of dirt like all the rest of us you ain't that valuable you ain't got that much worse the only worse than any of us is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ oh my so these Saints had addicted themselves notice he said addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints so they had such a burden such a desire in their hearts and they had devoted themselves to the ministry notice he does not put it in a singular form well it's just my pastor my pastor my pastor my pastor my pastor all my pastor you're a worshiper of a man if that's all you think about but they didn't look at it as just in one particular man but they looked at the ministry so it would have been pastored it would have been evangelist it would have been teachers and they wanted to do everything they could do they wanted to pray they wanted to be able to help them maybe if they could financially who knows what they could do but they addicted themselves to serving the ministry because they really had an understanding that if the ministry is where they need to be and their help the Saints will grow that saints were abound in the goodness of God it ain't no wonder the devil hates the ministry and that they were living in and attacks it like never before well praise the Lord so they showed them Hospitality or provided for their needs or they pray we really don't know what all that they don't but they attended to everything they could do and so much that they were addicts well praise God one some of the very few addicts that'll ever walked down streets of gold and they continue in their addiction no doubt until they passed on this life into the other and that addiction drove them to page after page after page of good works and one day them idex are going to stand before God and the Lord Jesus will open them books and said all my brothers all my brothers and my sisters look at what you've done you helped Paul you helped the epaphras you helped to mosius you helped this one you've done that and by what you did you strengthened their hands remember Moses that mighty man of God when he he stood up there and as long as his hands were raised up holding the rod of God the children of Israel defeated their enemy the actual law Moses hands got so tired you can imagine gravitation pulling you down the blood trying to pump up in your arms it would be the natural feeling for any of us after so long for your hands and your arms to get tired and they would go numb basically so what did Moses have to have he had to have some guys to come over and they stood under his hands under his arms maybe one under this arm and one under that arm and they said right there they're a man of God keep your hands up high keep praying keep reading keep studying let me do what I can do to lighten your love let me do what I can do to keep your hands up Moses because a man Moses hands come down they begin to lose the battle let me tell you it's the same way in the last day if the ministry gets sidetracked on this and sidetracked on that our churches will lose the battle that's why we need people of God that will pray for the god-called ministry and do everything they care to hold up their hands and pray and say God help my brothers God's strengthen my brother as you're holding up their hands you are helping yourself because as you minister to the ministry the ministry turns right back and ministers to the saints of God thank you let me show you a kaleidoscope of an assortment of things that people did in the Bible let's look at another man by the name of epaphras this brethren in Colossians chapter 4 verse 12 apatris Apophis was a minister and the church at colossae now notice what Paul identifies about this man Apophis which is one of you a servant of Christ salute us you always laboring fervently for you in what laboring look at the meaning of this word strive fight to enter into a contest contend in the gymnastic games to contend with adversaries every time I read this verse I think about brother Daryl Ward he's one of the prayers man I know and it ain't a show it's from his heart I spent a lot of time with him and hear him pray he don't pray that way just in front of a microphone but he prays that way when you're out hunting whenever you stop to get food whatever because that's the kind of man he is I wonder how many Saints know how to labor in prayer isn't it amazing that this guy was a preacher but Paul does not tell us what a great Theologian he was he doesn't even tell us if the man must straighten his Doctrine no doubt he must have been but we don't know anything about his great depths of the word we don't know anything about how many people he wondered the Lord Jesus we don't know anything about how many Souls that he won but one of the things that was so outstanding to Paul about this brother was that he labored fervently for you in prayers now this is what he prayed for that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God you mean the brother was not praying for new Cadillacs and new Ford pickup trucks and new Jaguars and you know bigger houses and my I knew this and I knew that no but the brother had such an understanding that the afterlife was what burdened him for the saints of God and he would get down to pray and it was like he would enter into a gymnastic game you can imagine like your brothers get over and run up and down that ball court back and forth and back and forth and your sweating like a bunch of hogs when you get up and what's accomplished some of you old men hurt your knee some of you fall and hurt your foot I just hope it got enough insurance to cover all this stuff but I wonder I'm not against that now but I wonder if we wouldn't be a better Church if some of us didn't pray till they broke through on a sweat and we entered into another game a game against Satan and all of his demons Satan you're not going to stop my brothers you're not going to stop my sisters they are going to come to a place of perfection in Christ Jesus notice this is not the norm of praying this is not the now I'll lay me down to sleep some of y'all make it past the word sleep this was laboring bravery praise God and some of you all have been wondering what you could do I know somebody said brother Donnie when are you going to tell us here you go I'm telling you always laboring fervently with a fevered pitch with a fevered pitch for you and prayers that ye may stand perfect now look at this you know the the words and the way that they go from the English of course to the Greek and the Aramaic can be very confusing sometimes but I want you to notice as Paul uses this word laboring and then he goes from that into perfect and this word that Paul chose to use for laboring is the very same word that Matthew used about the Lord Jesus and the Garden of Gethsemane when he prayed until he swept came as great drops of blood you see this is why we still have grudges in our heart against one another if you listen to it in 1958 in Chattanooga you'll hear the prophet of God say I don't think anyone if you'll go Before the Throne of God and pray through I don't think you can ever stand Before the Throne of God and come back with a hard feeling in your heart against anybody because you know what you do you get Before the Throne of God and you realize how much help you need yourself but the problem of it is we don't go deep enough and we go to God with faults and hard feelings and all that sort of thing and we come right back down with the same hard feelings you need to pray more and you need to pray longer get this old thing of this hold in your house Thou shalt Thou shalt labor labor fervently till you get past you feel it so you get past well he done this she done that so you get to a place where you say Lord God have mercy on me and help me that I can forgive my brother help me that I can forgive my sister come on church until we can get to a place that we can walk over and hug a man's neck who would kill us until we can do that we're not ready for the Rapture I don't know how much we can talk about the Seven Seals or the seven Thunders until we can forgive all men of their trespasses we're not ready to fly [Applause] who Jesus my mom that ye may stand perfect look at this word teleos this is not sinlessness but a full age so epaphras was praying for every saint that God would help him to grow up and you imagine every time I see you brother Keith I'm praying for you brother you'll grow up I'm praying for you Sister Janet you'll grow up I'm praying for you brother Donnie your girl up now you imagine after a while you say look here big boy who do you think you're talking to anyway I'm the preacher who said I'm still praying for you you need to grow up So This Man Called an understanding in order to make the rap shot it's not going to be how much we have up here it's what we take from down here and put down here and put into action here and here and we live this word we don't just talk it we don't debate it we don't argue it but we become the message of the hour living the Lord Jesus to the world and Latin the world see those a real living resurrected savior ah wow so brother apaphos prayed that all the saints would be of full age brought to his end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness consummate human integrity and virtue you know Paul never said a papers prayed when he felt like it well many of us do nor did he Pray when he was told to pray it was a Ministry now he's a preacher he's a preacher you imagine now this is this is the way this brother's known he's only mentioned one more time in the whole new testament and again it's not about his great ability to speak it's not about more he would hold people's fail about but there was something about this man's Ministry that was so overwhelming that Paul felt to pin it and write about this man thank God for a man like a perfect you see he was not praying whatever Believers prayed and when they stopped he stopped he prayed when they didn't he prayed when nobody told him to he prayed when he felt like it he prayed for what he did you see that is a Ministry oh people say well I've got a minister for this and a minister for that well if you do then you'll do it when you're up you'll do it when you're down you'll do it when you're in you're dope and you're out you ain't gonna have to be begged to do it pumped to do it primed to do it paid to do it you're going to do it if it's a god-called Ministry well notice on verse 13. for I bear him record that he hath a great zeal for you and them that are in laodicea and them in hieropolis so here this man was so effects on and he's praying I love this that God would burden somebody to pray and some of you may say well all I ever do brother Donnie is pray for you all right people ask me all the time from around the world is there anything I can do for you can I sense you and your wife on a vacation name the place is there anything you want is there anything I can do for you my answer is always the same yes pray for me but this is the kind of praying I just want you to do dear gracious Heavenly Father I am most grateful for this blessed opportunity and I can come before you Lord I want to remember brother while I'm at it no I had more of this in life you get away from him Devil he's a man of God you ain't going to stop him now the church needs and get a hold of hold on get away get away not only not only will do me good that'll do you good it'll scare them Devil's enough to say good Lord I don't want to get around that head yet you know imagine that God he will dig his palm beside himself well they can feel so sanctimonious around some of us because we don't act like more in the game act like you are playing basketball act like you do playing pickleball act like the way you do playing soccer and football I mean put your heart into it then just sled into it devil I've come to contend with you take your hand off of my daughter take your hand off of my pastor take your hand off of our church say that in the name of Jesus back off back off same time oh praise oh my notice again in Colossians chapter 1 verse 9. for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding notice the direction that these brothers pray now this is tall this is not a password now this is Paul and this he's telling them what he prayed for them that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful and every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God so strengthened with Almighty according to his glorious power unto all patients and long-suffering with joyfulness now look they didn't spend all their time bringing their list to God God I need this I want that I don't want that look at the things they prayed about understand him joyfulness patience in the middle of Trials anybody hearing me tonight one of the sisters from our church takes care one day this week said her little son he heard me mention here on Sunday about brother Daryl having a prayer list and I said probably a good thing for the rest of us to have one so this little tiny lad sitting right here looking at me now told his mama to text Carol and ask her for a list of people he could pray for and I saw how awesome how awesome is that look I don't care if it's a little boy that gets into some of you little stubborn heads won't get it praise God that's some of these youngins get it Lord II Thessalonians 2 16 now Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even Our Father which hath loved us and have given us everlasting consolation and Good Hope through Grace Comfort your hearts and establish you and every good word and work now while Hollywood take word and work and put them hand in hand so establish you and every good work so in other words it's not something you do on occasion we're supposed to be as established in good works as we are in good Doctrine praise the Lord oh thank you Lord Hebrews 6 10. for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and your labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints you mean to tell me when I help you and you help me and we help one another we are doing this to the name of God how many by Jesus of parachutes if he needed them suit shirt whatever he needed right you have the opportunity that man would help Jesus if he needed a month's rent he didn't have no house so he didn't have to pay them taxes like that anyway property tax he didn't own anything he became poor that through his poverty we might be made rich not so much in houses and lands but rich in the good things of God notice this he says for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the Saints and do minister so God is Not unfaithful to his promise so the fruit of Salvation is seen here in ministering to the Believers and identified as good works now watch then when we go to doing things for God doing things for his people there always comes a warning I know this seems strange but it's because we're still dealing with this human part of ours so we go to doing things for people and we help the church do this and that and the other and then we have to always counter balance all of that watch how Paul did this in Galatians 6 3 warning against self-estimation for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceive us himself so you see pride always overestimates oneself Pride calls his people to evaluate their own worse and I will always over evaluate themselves so I am worth so much I mean I am so needed and I am so important and now um I don't have a glass of water but I'll use this brother Adam said you want to know how important you are let me get it down where everybody can see it show me the hole show me the hole I made in the drink I heard him say it yesterday he was at a museum and they had the value of a human body so they took the evaluation of it so much copper so much you know this and that and the other and he said the value on that day which was 1962. was 84 cents so with inflation and everything under our current Administration you might be worth 249 by now since everything's went out and said this true boy Senator one of his name's Jim one other named John he said boy John was sure ain't worth much I already said boy we sure ain't he said I turn around told them boys but boys your soul is worth ten thousand worlds so as far as our Humanity it ain't worth very much at all but yet Satan tries whenever we go to doing things for for God and for his people then Satan will try to twist it around on you now this is one of them words that I mentioned to you a while ago that Paul himself coined and it's a very peculiar word deceiving himself it's a very peculiar in the sense that you can't find anywhere else in classical Greek writing and he himself he said Paul puts himself under an hallucination so the man looks at himself and he hallucinates so the man walks up on the scales of value and he weighs 500 million tons that's what he thinks he weighs but in reality but six ounces but he looks at himself and said Lord have mercy I knew I was important but I didn't realize that it wasn't the Lord but the Lord must have made the whole earth for me why I'll tell you one thing he must have made every flower to me and mine he made every tree with me and might I'll tell you one thing he just couldn't function without me I don't know how in the world the church even has service without me we did fine before you came we'll do fine if you go somewhere else you all did okay before I came and if I go somewhere else you'll do all right without me I'll tell you how important we are as an individual not very but as a group we are irreplaceable we are irreplaceable oh I don't care how much you think you're worse tonight friends every one of us need the Lord Jesus greater than we've ever needed him and not only that we need one another no man is an island God don't save you to set you off by yourself [Applause] it's what I mean I just wanted to bring something that kind of ease the pressure lead us into the weekend right yeah yeah y'all with me it's okay Galatians 6 4 but let every man wow prove his own work then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone my goodness and not in another let every man prove his own work young people God don't want you going through your teens in your 20s and your 30s trying to look for what does God want me to do well surely let me revealed to you father long as you go but don't waste these teen years of your life don't waste these twenties of your life learn to learn to pray learn to Bear one of those burdens don't wait till you're done wore out and they say Okay God is there anything I can do here y'all go sit down the recliner while you got your strengths why you got your stamina why you got your desire to do something well I'm brother down why don't you just want to stop doing something no pray pray I love the series on adoption listen to this in 1960. brother I'm talking about the mothers uh the Patriarchs when they were born possessed and Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost set them in now once it runs the parallel between the Israel the Old Testament and the New Testament Saints the Holy Ghost has said in the church Apostles prophets to some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he's given into them with speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles praise the Lord so does it mean because every preacher is not called to preach conventions he's somehow less man I feel sorry for some of these brothers in the message because a lot of them will never preach a convention a lot of them will never be drawn to this place or that place or another place and they attend those meetings and they sit there knowing that they'll never stand behind a Pulpit and preach to hundreds of thousands they know that they'll never do it I wonder sometimes how some of them walk away and we rally around the big people and make them feel like they are totally useless but I wonder where our message would be if it wasn't for such men I wonder where we would be if it wasn't for such men but if we're not careful we will pick out who we sing are the great Heroes and we leave the unsung heroes back in a corner somewhere so I was reading about this this week and I came across an article where there was this certain great great man in the Evangelical move not in our move but in the Evangelical move and he'd written this famous book about how to make Sunday schools grow and he went through all these principles of doing this and that and the other on how to make it grow and this this certain preacher would want to hear this guy and he got up there and gave the oration it wasn't really a preacher you know then he got up there and gave his speech about what to do and people coming up to him after he had given his speech and him signing the book and autographing the book and this preacher went over there and talk to a friend of his and he said in reality you ought to been the man up there doing that because you and I both know that man right there don't even have a church and he has never even had a Sunday school class all he has done is got together the principles of the success of other men you're the one who's caused that to happen and he's making a name off of the success of a the man well that's the way it is a lot of times isn't it so they will become the rich and the famous and the important but to strip out those little men the prophet one time in a meeting and also can find this on tape well he talked about people that was fasting could come to the end of the service and he said that lame was healed and the blinded eyes were open and brother Brown said I'll tell you what caused the effect of this meeting it was some of this certain Brothers here and there and there and called their name and he said they have been fasting since the meeting started and God honored their fasting and their prayers you see that is a great man because a great man does not build his work on the labor of others and act like he himself was the one who did it well praise the Lord but he is able to recognize I think it ought to be a and the same Among Us that some that may fill out their unsung heroes will all I ever do is pray for brother Donnie don't you ever say that as if that was a small thing that is a great thing to me well I've never will be able to buy brother Donnie no vacation I couldn't even send him to Asheville and back that's all right you don't need to I've got a credit card but I'll tell you what you can do you can pray for me and you can love me and you can stand for me when things are going against me and when the things is difficult look I need people to stand with me like you need people to stand with you and what's so hurtful is when a pastor comes in one of the hardest time of his life and when you need people and then they turn and walk away from you you ought to experience that feeling when you give years of your life you give sleepless nights after another and they turn and walk away from you in the time of trouble what a disgrace what a disgrace what a disgrace if your brothers and sisters need you and needs your prayers and need your friendship and the time of trouble oh friend let's not do them like the disciples did the Lord Jesus when the Lord Jesus went out to pray and he come back and his disciples was all asleep and you imagine the hurt wonderful question that he asked could not you watch with me for one hour could not it must have broke his heart by the Larry that he comes back and nobody is praying nobody is sitting there oh Jesus Jesus we're so sorry if he ever needed them and not one of them even showed concern all sheltered oh yes I'd have never done that well let's judge the way you're treating God's people now and we'll see how you'd have treated him then so you find somebody down and out in the church we're not here to push them down farther I don't understand we're supposed to be the army of God and when our people get down we go back and kill our own wounded we push them on down we stomp their head in the ground well you may do that but I ain't going to do it I'm going to reach down even if I've got to get my hands dirty I'm going to reach down if they're in the filth and the mire if that's what I gotta do that's what I'm gonna do why because that's what God's Prophet said the people do look at Abraham I'm reaching down there to get lost he risked his own life and risks the life of 318 of his own servant to go get her a penny a penny you rest the life of a silver dollar to get a penny if you've got the love of God in you you will all let them go they're worthless and who made you God [Applause] whew dear Jesus let's stand who praise the Lord I didn't say I was down I just told you to stand let me read another paragraph here to you where the church is now he said this is my purpose in doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner but don't do that you can never raise corn in ephraim's corner your Manasseh you got to take your place in Christ positionally take it so don't just be something so yourself I'm doing something no go before God help me what can I do What Can I Do Lord to help the body what can I do to help the ministry what can I do to help the preachers of the church What Can I Do Lord to help the ministry around the world well some of you can't support them you don't have the means to do that but you can bombard heaven for him God brings one on your heart at three o'clock in the morning you may not know it may be your prayer that God will send the angel of the Lord by his win bring him out the deepest thing has ever been in his life and when you stand there that day and the Lord says oh I see you was woke up at 305 on Tuesday morning you couldn't go back to sleep you lay there and prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed just so you'll know it was your prayer that was answered in the servant of God got a Deliverance that he needed and you saw oh my goodness my prayer you mean I've done that man wants to do more for God and his people Hallelujah Lord Jesus as we bow our heads tonight father dear God we don't desire to be great people we don't desire to be important we don't want to be begging our own eyes but if there's something you can do with us Lord in a week or so Carol and I will be 67 years old I would have never thought time would have ever went on this long I would have never thought I would have outlived my mother and father and live longer than them Lord I've lived already longer than the allotted time you gave to your prophet how much more time do I have left Lord you're the only one who knows dear God I pray whatever time I do have left help me that I can serve you with all of my heart Jesus I think if you were when you were here walking on the Earth and I read how you were treated and I was saying oh if I could have only been there I would have done this or that or the other the Lord I have my opportunity now so Lord May each of us look at ourselves and think am I living just a selfish life to where it's it's my my job my home my family my my my help us Lord to search and realize we are a body and we're just a local assembly here but we are a body that's in touch with people around the world Lord every day of my life I'm hearing from around the world before nine o'clock in the morning last week I heard from Japan in India Africa different nations in Africa all over the world by noon over the continents of the Earth this need that need another need some needing a building some needing prayer some needing Direction some needing to question answered some needing counsel about this Lord help us oh Jesus help us that we don't just live to ourselves and thank all that we have as ours we're only stewards of what you've committed to our care forgive us Lord God help me Lord that I'll not turn my back on my brothers my sisters oh I hope I hope that if I would have been one of them in the Garden of Gethsemane that when you come back I would have been praying or at least setting up what I've been like Peter would I I know self-deceit is one of the hardest things to see how would we all have been it would go back in time and instead of it being James and John and Peter and their other brothers it was us it's me and Joe and Daryl and Joel Kings these other brothers and sisters it was us in the garden what would you have found if you'd walked in on us what we've been sleeping to would you have woke us up and said hey Donnie can't you watch with me for one hour I'm sorry Lord I'm I'm sorry I I just so so sleepy help us Lord help us Lord God Lord Jesus may we realize the way we treat your people is the way we treat you father may this be such a an alarm as it were we think different we behave differently toward one another forgive us for having respect of persons thinking this person is better than the other one and they're in a better class your Prophet has already told us about class he said that kind of class was of the devil so I don't want none of it I don't want nothing to do with it Lord as a matter of fact he went on to Define class for us he said there is no better class than the people of God in that Lord I've seen around the world walk into their homes a dirt floor in their house some of them Lord with not even proper clothes on and yet Lord they went out and bought me a little drink and bought me a little treat no tell them what it cost them they wanted to bring it to me and the sisters bowed before you and walk backwards out of your presence and the brothers come in and bow down on the knee and say brother would you please pray for me you think Lord God I'm not even worthy to lay hands on them folks make you want to bow down to them help us Lord oh are they poor so poor they don't even have electricity some of them don't have running water in their house but the people that heaven is made out of oh Jesus help us Lord help us not to get this oh American Spirit on us we want the Holy Ghost on his Lord we see what's happening to this world and this nation America's doomed there's no mercy for her Lord God may we as your people do everything we can to help one another to make life just a little bit easier we love you father your Prophet loved Humanity so much that he prayed they would find a cure for cancer he didn't pray that they'd all be healed by Divine Healing but he prayed they would find a cure for it he loved humans he didn't just love the message people but he loved human beings and he prayed that you had helped the doctors to find a cure for cancer I pray you do Lord us having battled it ourselves I pray you do Lord God we love you Jesus forgive us of our shortcomings of our selfishness self-centeredness Lord and we wonder what we can do we can pray we can pray we can intercede glory to God we can think about your name we can worship you we can glorify you praise God we love you Lord Jesus forgive us for wasting so much of our time on Facebook and Instagram and tick tock and this and that and the other a bunch of wasted hours when we could be praying and praising and blessed your name and thinking about you Hallelujah I'm thinking Lord what can I do to make the meetings better Lord what can I do what can I contribute maybe not money Lord maybe a prayer maybe I can pray for the preachers Lord maybe I can ask the deacons is there anything Brothers I could do could I park a car can I pick up paper could I hand out water what could I do to be able to minister to these Saints as they're coming in from France and coming in from all different parts of the states what can I do what can I do oh Jesus we love you Lord we don't want this just to be our attitude to these special meetings we want this to be our attitude for the rest of our lives May every day for the rest of my life be centered on what I can do for you granted I pray Lord God we know that brother random said raising our hands is a sign of universal sign of surrender may we raise our hands tonight as a sign of surrender to the will of God I Surrender my opinion My Views this other if they're wrong I surrender to you Lord Jesus take me Lord use me help me but keep in mind what you want to do for God and what you're called to do for God is not always the same thing you may think you're so talented and so gifted to do this or that or the other and you think well this is my strong point well I hate to be the one to inform you he generally don't use our strengths he uses our weaknesses it takes those weaknesses and does the job with our weaknesses proven that it was him that did it praise the Lord with their hands uplifted not only those in the visible audience those of you that are streaming tonight Wherever You Are we surrender all Lord Hallelujah we give you our strengths which sometimes is our greatest enemy we give you our weaknesses the things we're ashamed of our frailties our infirmities and yet your prophet and preaching that resounding message of perfect strength to perfect weakness says that's what you take and you tackle the job with that and Moses said he was not eloquent he couldn't speak he didn't have a message all the things he didn't have and God said I'll take every one of them and I'll take over Egypt with them which is exactly what you did thank you Father you took an illiterate Kentuckian that didn't even

can't do it we just we just can't do that the man telling brother Brandon was the owner of the drugstore he said brother Branham I heard that story and I said wait a minute I was sitting back in the office laughs he said I get up and went out and I looked at that woman he said she was so sick and he said let me have that so this man went and filled a prescription and laid it in that woman's hand and he said brother Branham when I did it it was Jesus how late that medicine in the hands of Jesus I said do you believe that he said yes I believe it because he said when you do it to the least of these you do it to me sometimes the least things that all of us can do are things that we think have no value but you imagine that day when he stands before the Lord Jesus and that man will walk up there and he'll say thank you for that medicine you give me I was so sick thank you Jesus when did I see you stick you remember that day on your drugstore that must mean oh God help us forgive us
