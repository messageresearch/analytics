[42:38] and say that you'll obey the voice to
[42:41] him
[42:42] it's amazing to have himself
[42:46] however we can do so sometimes and we
[42:48] are so convinced that we arrived and
[42:51] somebody would show us his word and it
[42:53] was just saying all right episode
[42:57] a lot of the Bible says the heart it's
[43:00] such a disease
[43:03] the one for the mercy of God
[43:06] it had zero
[43:09] National in this church including zero
[43:13] beginning with me
[43:17] thank you buddy
[43:20] man I just made it kind of Limitless so
[43:23] we could understand this yes
[43:30] utterly destroyed
[43:33] us
[43:35] but this is
[43:38] a King's wife
[43:41] was now at sea
[43:43] of the king
[43:46] and some years after this
[43:49] will find another God
[43:52] 's praise God
[43:54] remember his name
[43:57] if he was an Old Lady Gaga he would be
[44:00] serious trouble all the hundreds and
[44:03] hundreds of lots of lost because once a
[44:06] law they have the leaves a person's name
[44:08] he's the king himself couldn't change it
[44:18] to fight for themselves but hundreds of
[44:21] them are killed
[44:23] they call us included
[44:25] a message came
[44:39] horribly thought it was so nice
[44:42] we realize father
[44:45] Your Grace is still about true
[44:48] thank you Lord that you're merciful
[44:52] thus
[44:53] we're not talking about
[45:00] Lord we see the path of the elect
[45:03] Ron Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses and
[45:07] Jeremiah
[45:09] we look and see the little neighbor and
[45:11] let us see
[45:12] we're still
[45:14] communities
[45:15] and we see the same about us today
[45:18] we're so grateful
[45:25] it's no mystery Lord that we don't need
[45:27] you
[45:28] oh Lord how you would need us
[45:37] to say
[45:40] of all others I'm grateful that you are
[45:43] here
[45:44] I'm pretty much just take the words of
[45:46] my Lord speak to the same way
[45:49] interested by these examples how
[45:52] grateful we are if you have a Bible
[45:54] written with not only positive sayings
[45:59] but she hadn't written about the errors
[46:01] in the six people
[46:03] so if we agreed them and learn about it
[46:06] and hopefully not with the hands to us
[46:10] so how do you speak to us in that once
[46:13] again by Your Word father it performed
[46:15] the sick people out bad on vacation
[46:17] things you just watch all of them and
[46:20] give us some more seek to his father can
[46:23] we meet people
[46:24] Jesus Christ
[46:28] [Applause]
[46:39] I'm sure I wanted to realize it
[46:44] all of us
[46:46] are responsible to the Lord for
[46:48] the gifts and he gives us
[46:52] the abilities house
[46:55] even the influence that we have
[46:58] all your parents will answer what we
[47:01] have to understand you have on your
[47:03] children
[47:04] we will answer for the influence that
[47:06] maybe some of those older ones have on
[47:08] younger people
[47:18] and it's it's an amazing thing to me
[47:21] having been around for a little while
[47:23] anyway
[47:24] sometimes leaders can get to a spot to
[47:28] where they feel almost an example status
[47:32] of being correct
[47:35] nothing to say
[47:37] foreign
[47:47] [Applause]
[48:08] ation on the Earth
[48:10] the tallest man or something like that
[48:12] happened together into a certain place
[48:17] instead of hungry himself a higher the
[48:21] kid it's long the less they feel they
[48:24] have to answer to anybody I ask you to
[48:27] know no one challenges me no one person
[48:31] they are above the wall but we can see
[48:34] that it runs that way in the world
[48:38] as well this is what of course would
[48:41] happen to Salt the salt in the field
[48:44] that he was at that spot God would use
[48:47] it God had an orange to him and good
[48:51] things that happened when you know
[48:53] that his first king
[48:55] for this thing was just a little bunch
[48:57] of them over again
[48:59] finally
[49:01] some value
[49:03] but there are definitely didn't even
[49:05] clocked like this that is
[49:08] group of Israel together and been able
[49:11] to pull off as we would say long Victory
[49:14] I have to another Factory they were
[49:16] interested pictures it was large and
[49:19] and he would have stayed in this place
[49:21] that he would have on a man he could
[49:23] have knew he could have had a
[49:25] United States
[49:30] but yet because something to get it to
[49:33] happen to me and whatever Central
[49:36] addresses and he he goes to the rude
[49:38] calls and he says because this happened
[49:42] it's all you were little in your own
[49:45] eyes then God chose to be the king and
[49:48] God shows you to be Prince over his
[49:50] people so what happened saying you
[49:53] listen and using this in a parabolic
[49:55] form that something happens that's a
[49:58] solid itself he was no longer lived in
[50:01] his own lives but the name of a massive
[50:03] said that God has a hard time trying to
[50:07] find the man that he can use because he
[50:10] said a lot of man when God wants you do
[50:13] so
[50:26] and another Johnson was there
[50:30] remember this but everybody was standing
[50:33] up and I quoted that quote and brother
[50:36] and said God can caught the man that he
[50:38] can use it and the Lord that he used to
[50:41] see the liver that hits the last
[50:44] opposite the way that people go and the
[50:46] way people sing because many times the
[50:49] more God makes a son and the greater
[50:51] than he uses them the bigger they can
[50:53] come in our lives so as I have voted
[50:57] that
[51:14] because it makes such an impression on
[51:17] me as secretion someone had a lot more
[51:20] to that but the vet said to no one that
[51:22] God will use the man will literally
[51:24] he'll get so when I said that when
[51:26] Johnson had his hands on the back that
[51:29] Peter Griffin had lost this and whenever
[51:31] I said before God uses in the literary
[51:34] edition of the Johnson one like this and
[51:36] then I said her wife said the Lord God
[51:38] Jesus said so there I guess and it just
[51:41] kept my head down so low
[51:44] talking about having these things
[51:48] and there was something about that
[51:50] realist of that book that struck him
[51:53] that I and it shot me because it shut
[51:58] down I was totally had different parts
[52:00] of the world because I saw that quote in
[52:05] a real form that a man called it and
[52:09] realized what it could be
[52:12] and you know that God
[52:17] question answers and he said said man
[52:20] generally wants to become a god
[52:22] or a niche
[52:24] before the people
[52:26] my computer said
[52:29] you're thinking anybody would know how
[52:32] wrong you are you would right
[52:36] out of the Lord would you ever
[52:40] the urination
[52:55] spirit
[53:00] I have never he saw that
[53:03] and he struck that Circle and lived
[53:08] now of course it was from Canada to
[53:11] Georgia
[53:12] and he struck it down shepherdstrom
[53:15] and when he struck with some brothers
[53:17] and spoke to him and he turned around to
[53:20] speak to them brothers and that Bruce
[53:23] serpenter crawled into the water
[53:26] he didn't kill him
[53:28] now he mentions about himself and said
[53:32] that it had bitten him
[53:36] but the blood was so rich
[53:40] he could not take a touch
[53:43] now look how
[53:45] that spirit that did he think could be
[53:49] able to everybody even the rest of us it
[53:53] was himself
[53:54] him
[53:59] and talk to poison his breath would you
[54:03] notice he doesn't say his mind was
[54:05] stronger and his will was strong and his
[54:09] gift but he said the blood was soft what
[54:13] was the brown blood no it wasn't
[54:15] grounded blood it was the blood of Jesus
[54:19] flesh
[54:32] but that thing has been around actually
[54:34] before brother back and made it outside
[54:37] it's something that helps to exalt man
[54:40] in the storm to come to his Christian
[54:42] dog and the life saves the way that a
[54:45] man will make himself God right and he
[54:49] will exalted
[54:54] and saw that Saul exalted and
[54:58] it's above the word of God and he didn't
[55:00] think this word and the back word and
[55:02] that word really isn't it that much if
[55:05] he's just kind of
[55:07] paraphrases what God Said that people
[55:10] have to be word for word well that's
[55:13] what he saw in the Garden of Eden so he
[55:16] would just act out of
[55:18] paraphrasing of what the prophet told
[55:21] him to do and God would accept it
[55:26] that she believed be the city that
[55:30] whatever she said
[55:32] what's wrong
[55:34] so whatever she said it was God and it
[55:38] goes why that was a great figure of
[55:41] course down to the age of succumbed now
[55:44] notice this in first time 15 22 10 I
[55:47] said how come the Lord is praying the
[55:49] line and earned offers and sacrifices as
[55:52] in obeying the voice of the Lord behold
[55:55] to obey is better than sacrifice and to
[56:00] hearken than the fan of rain a river
[56:03] nation and a Samuel was both of Levi's
[56:06] and a prophet so he's not moving away
[56:09] within the minute Lord or the sacrifice
[56:23] no matter what we do for God if we don't
[56:28] go back what God says what we do in the
[56:32] order of sacrifice can totally be lost
[56:41] [Applause]
[56:45] sacrifice
[56:51] and the way you look and see that they
[56:54] have saved earlier and that's my husband
[56:56] Into the Book of Matthew and also on the
[56:58] Book of Revelation now notice I wasn't
[57:00] aware of say this as a token full of
[57:03] obedience to the Lord this is the
[57:06] children
[57:07] brains God
[57:10] the word
[57:12] eternal
[57:14] in you as a diet
[57:20] praise God
[57:25] follow me into the word brain saw the
[57:30] word Eternal in you and that is the
[57:34] token when the word is in you is Christ
[57:37] in you now don't say anyone ever we pray
[57:41] we have told him when we pray we have a
[57:44] token or present our company with our
[57:48] prayer so it's not your words it's not
[57:51] how long even in church I'm a pastor's
[57:54] daughter a pastor's son I preached for
[57:57] 50 years I've done this don't bring my
[57:59] time back to God what you bring to God
[58:01] is your hope God heals my badge as I
[58:06] believe I have a right to everything we
[58:09] cross in your word Lord I'm trying to
[58:25] [Applause]
[58:45] all the states in our life and in our
[58:48] marriage and not bad members of all that
[58:50] sacred room whereas
[58:52] but God knows if we present our cookie
[58:55] in Augustine it's our favorite City then
[58:59] if you bring it back I don't care what's
[59:01] in front of you if it stands if it's
[59:03] cancer if it's ice
[59:06] pneumonia whatever it is it don't matter
[59:08] it cannot overcome your token right
[59:26] but yet he did not reject at all did
[59:59] of what God Said but God don't want
[1:00:03] nothing away
[1:00:05] [Applause]
[1:00:10] because the church lay out in all the
[1:00:12] Bible it's been interpreted and it's
[1:00:15] been handled down you know the Latin
[1:00:16] ballgame and then
[1:00:19] come down to weightlifting
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:01:01] [Applause]
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:18] as he goes on and he says because you
[1:01:22] rejected the word God has rejected you
[1:01:25] from being King but I want you to think
[1:01:28] about this now every hour
[1:01:31] God did not displace him right then
[1:01:36] he went Long Beach he went off and it
[1:01:40] was a crown he was on wiring the road he
[1:01:45] went on in the position of the throne
[1:01:47] and had blessing after blessing after
[1:01:51] blessed
[1:01:53] thank you
[1:01:57] oh okay I'm not surprised I'll tell you
[1:02:01] what y'all do go back and get my other
[1:02:02] iPad for me because it's been one of
[1:02:04] them Wednesdays
[1:02:06] I've had the office day that ever was
[1:02:09] I'm not surprised at all slew foot's
[1:02:11] trying to show up
[1:02:12] but devil I'm warning you now you better
[1:02:15] get out of here
[1:02:17] you better get out of here devil because
[1:02:19] we're going to have church
[1:02:20] [Applause]
[1:02:23] sorry y'all missed however long you
[1:02:25] missed there they said it wasn't working
[1:02:26] on the internet where was I oh yeah here
[1:02:28] we go actually when God said you
[1:02:32] heard and
[1:02:37] has rejected you but it's sort of like
[1:02:40] it was in the Garden of Eden when God
[1:02:42] told Adam and the day you eat thereof
[1:02:45] that day you shall surely die
[1:02:49] but did he
[1:02:52] did Adam physically die that day
[1:02:56] no
[1:02:57] as a matter of fact you lived to be 930
[1:03:00] years old
[1:03:02] was song displaced that day no
[1:03:07] you see that's what is so deceiving for
[1:03:09] people sometimes when they go to getting
[1:03:12] into sin and they go to doing this and
[1:03:14] that and the other and God doesn't
[1:03:16] immediately just Smite him down and you
[1:03:19] know give them a flu and give them covet
[1:03:21] on top of that and then pneumonia on top
[1:03:22] of that that'd scare the liver out of
[1:03:24] most of us
[1:03:25] but we can do a little wrong and then a
[1:03:27] little more wrong and then a little more
[1:03:29] wrong when we go to church and we're
[1:03:30] still blessed and we still feel the
[1:03:33] presence of the Lord and everything
[1:03:34] seems to be really good don't you see
[1:03:36] what that does to us that convinces us
[1:03:39] that we're all right
[1:03:41] so you see the blessing of God was not
[1:03:45] taken but it started that very day that
[1:03:48] God was going
[1:03:50] to replace him I myself don't want to
[1:03:54] walk as close as I can to sin I want to
[1:03:57] walk as far away as I can from it
[1:03:59] I don't want to look back and realize
[1:04:02] Lord have mercy I miss God five years
[1:04:04] ago and it just now caught up with me
[1:04:07] you understand what I'm saying so here
[1:04:10] he says God has rejected you from being
[1:04:14] King now turn with me if you would in
[1:04:17] the Book of Matthew and watch the Lord
[1:04:18] Jesus as he picks up along this same
[1:04:21] line watch how gifts can be actually
[1:04:26] genuine gifts that can be given to
[1:04:29] people whose nature and whose soul will
[1:04:33] never be born again
[1:04:34] and yet have genuine gifts from God and
[1:04:38] just as true as a saint of God's gift is
[1:04:42] true Matthew 7 21 not everyone that says
[1:04:47] unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:04:51] kingdom of heaven
[1:04:52] but he that
[1:04:56] do us the
[1:04:58] okay so it's not everybody then that
[1:05:01] says Jesus Is My Lord
[1:05:04] he is my savior he is my redeemer I know
[1:05:09] this this is not debatable because this
[1:05:12] is the Lord Jesus himself saying it so
[1:05:15] it's not those that say that it's them
[1:05:18] that actually do his will but he that
[1:05:22] doeth the will of My Father which is in
[1:05:26] heaven so not everyone that saith unto
[1:05:28] me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:05:30] kingdom of heaven so a person can
[1:05:33] actually call him Lord and Savior and
[1:05:36] Redeemer and King and so on and so on
[1:05:38] and not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:05:41] oh my goodness well who will those that
[1:05:44] do the will of his father now notice in
[1:05:47] verse 22 many will say to me in that day
[1:05:52] Lord Lord
[1:05:54] now I want you to notice what's happened
[1:05:56] to these people they have lived their
[1:05:59] life and they died as Mortals
[1:06:02] somehow another when they went into that
[1:06:06] holding place in another dimension
[1:06:10] their soul still never gained the
[1:06:14] Consciousness that they were lost
[1:06:18] death does not change you
[1:06:21] so when they died they felt like they
[1:06:25] were real Christians and they were
[1:06:28] preachers or you know whatever they were
[1:06:30] missionaries Sunday school teachers and
[1:06:32] so on and whenever they died now
[1:06:35] remember some people brother random told
[1:06:37] us of several that whenever there's
[1:06:39] laying on the death's bed and their soul
[1:06:41] come back to them and then they go to
[1:06:44] screaming oh I'm lost I'm lost
[1:06:48] but that don't happen to everybody
[1:06:52] you see there are many many people that
[1:06:55] when they die they still are in that
[1:06:59] deceived state of darkness and their
[1:07:02] soul does not come to the consciousness
[1:07:05] of light
[1:07:07] so when the Resurrection comes they will
[1:07:10] actually raise from the dead
[1:07:13] they will stand before the Lord God in
[1:07:16] the body they sinned in
[1:07:19] which their garments testifies against
[1:07:22] them
[1:07:23] so they will walk up before him now they
[1:07:26] still have the exact same testimony that
[1:07:29] they did when they died so they didn't
[1:07:32] say oh Lord I'm lost I'm lost I'm lost
[1:07:34] you see all of those when their soul
[1:07:36] comes back before they die when they
[1:07:39] stand before God they will not stand
[1:07:42] there and say this they will stand and
[1:07:44] say oh God be merciful oh God be
[1:07:46] merciful because the consciousness of
[1:07:49] their nature they had it before they
[1:07:52] left
[1:07:53] but some actually die in deceit
[1:07:57] they actually die and their soul lord
[1:08:00] god of Mercy
[1:08:03] their soul is actually sealed
[1:08:07] with this deceit and they will raise
[1:08:10] from the dead
[1:08:13] thinking they're going into heaven
[1:08:18] think of it they will walk up before the
[1:08:20] Throne of God with no fear they will
[1:08:23] walk up praise God hallelujah oh thank
[1:08:27] you Lord I I know he's going to say
[1:08:29] you've done this and you was a
[1:08:32] missionary for 50 years and and you
[1:08:34] bought the widowsome colon you've done
[1:08:36] this and that and the other and they
[1:08:38] will walk up there still with that
[1:08:40] Darkness on their soul and they'll walk
[1:08:43] right up and say Lord Lord I'm here
[1:08:50] you remember me don't you I had
[1:08:53] campaigns I preached I preached the ten
[1:08:56] thousand at a time I preached a 5 000 at
[1:08:59] a time I've done this that the other so
[1:09:02] they tell what they've done and they're
[1:09:04] saying what they really believe why
[1:09:06] they're deceived
[1:09:09] lost
[1:09:12] deceived standing before almighty God
[1:09:15] deceived
[1:09:19] you may think you ain't got much to
[1:09:21] praise him for tonight but you got a
[1:09:23] whole lot to praise him for
[1:09:25] aren't you glad he won't let you lie and
[1:09:28] get by with him aren't you glad he won't
[1:09:30] let you live and do wrong you know just
[1:09:33] get by with aren't you glad when you do
[1:09:35] something wrong or say something wrong
[1:09:36] there's something that just smites your
[1:09:39] heart I'll tell you we ought to be just
[1:09:40] about dancing all over this place here
[1:09:42] tonight you ought to be so grateful to
[1:09:45] God he won't let you do wrong and get by
[1:09:47] with it oh how many still get submitted
[1:09:50] in your heart when you do something
[1:09:51] wrong you ought to be a happy person
[1:09:55] now notice this setting many not a few
[1:09:59] many
[1:10:02] will say to me in that day Lord Lord
[1:10:07] notice they're not asking for mercy
[1:10:12] they don't think they need it
[1:10:15] Lord Lord have we not prophesied
[1:10:20] you're talking about a powerful word
[1:10:24] speak for us by divine inspiration
[1:10:28] to predict to utter Force declare a
[1:10:33] saying which can only be known
[1:10:37] by divine revelation
[1:10:39] to act as a prophet discharge the
[1:10:44] prophetic
[1:10:45] office
[1:10:49] now these people lying they're not the
[1:10:51] Lord Jesus says and say you're a lie
[1:10:53] you've never done it he does not
[1:10:55] question their credibility
[1:10:57] that they did it
[1:11:00] so they would actually stand there and
[1:11:02] make a prophecy thus saith the Lord this
[1:11:05] and this and this is going to happen and
[1:11:07] people say Lord have mercy that happened
[1:11:09] did you hear that oh my goodness oh that
[1:11:12] has to be a man of God be careful
[1:11:18] men of God aren't just known by prophecy
[1:11:21] or signs
[1:11:23] they're known by doing the will of God
[1:11:26] notice how Jesus separates Supernatural
[1:11:29] gifts from doing the will of God
[1:11:32] many will say to me on that day Lord
[1:11:34] Lord have not prophesied in thy name and
[1:11:37] in thy name
[1:11:39] so it makes you wonder these folks must
[1:11:42] have not been just trinitarians
[1:11:45] now I was a trinitarian okay
[1:11:49] you know how I used to pray for the sick
[1:11:51] years ago
[1:11:52] in the name of father son Holy Ghost
[1:11:57] my first water baptism was an adultery
[1:12:01] baptism
[1:12:03] that's what the prophet calls it titles
[1:12:06] don't sit there and look at me bug eyed
[1:12:08] mostly always baptized in adultery too
[1:12:11] we didn't have no name we had titles so
[1:12:14] apparently these people knew the power
[1:12:17] of the name
[1:12:21] notice in the response I don't say well
[1:12:23] I I laid hands on the sick in the name
[1:12:25] of the father in the name of the son the
[1:12:26] name of Holy Ghost no these folks said
[1:12:28] we did this in your name
[1:12:32] they understand a little bit about the
[1:12:34] godhead didn't they in thy name had cast
[1:12:37] out devils
[1:12:41] wow
[1:12:44] cast out devils and in thy name done
[1:12:49] many
[1:12:51] men into fall
[1:12:56] so here are lost preachers lost laity
[1:13:00] who knows what all this covers
[1:13:02] standing there just as Hell Bound as
[1:13:05] they can be and they are testifying of
[1:13:07] the glory of God they're telling God
[1:13:10] what they've done in life Lord I've done
[1:13:13] this I I'll tell you one thank God I've
[1:13:16] done that I've done something else and
[1:13:18] you imagine them standing there and
[1:13:20] they're expecting such great words
[1:13:24] from the Lord God
[1:13:26] now notice Jesus uses the word many
[1:13:30] so it wasn't like this happened one time
[1:13:33] in the this individual life and that was
[1:13:35] it no repeatedly
[1:13:42] oh my goodness
[1:13:44] may God help us
[1:13:47] do you understand there will be a
[1:13:49] preacher
[1:13:50] that will walk up there all of you know
[1:13:52] him
[1:13:53] you've read about him in the Bible
[1:13:56] his name
[1:13:58] is Judas
[1:14:05] a preacher that could stand there and
[1:14:07] have some testimonies Beyond some
[1:14:10] message preachers
[1:14:12] he was sent out in Matthew 10 to cast
[1:14:15] out devils
[1:14:17] in an amazing add power to cast him out
[1:14:20] but didn't have inward power to keep him
[1:14:22] from taking him over
[1:14:24] I ask you which one's the Most Blessed a
[1:14:28] person that can cast him out and still
[1:14:30] become possessed by him or a housewife
[1:14:32] or a young boy or a young girl that has
[1:14:35] an inward power in them and demons
[1:14:37] cannot take them over oh Hallelujah why
[1:14:42] because they have the token applied and
[1:14:44] Satan cannot get inside that Tabernacle
[1:14:52] Judas will be able to say some of these
[1:14:55] very things
[1:14:56] I cast out Devils I heal the sick I
[1:15:00] preach the message
[1:15:03] I told people about you Jesus I was one
[1:15:07] of the first ones as a matter of fact to
[1:15:10] preach about you my Ministry is not
[1:15:13] inferior to Peter my Ministry of is not
[1:15:16] inferior to John or any of the rest of
[1:15:18] them I had an equivalent Ministry and
[1:15:21] they questioned themself before they
[1:15:23] questioned me
[1:15:25] I was that close
[1:15:30] you call me to preach Jesus
[1:15:37] personally
[1:15:39] it wasn't your mama it wasn't your daddy
[1:15:41] I didn't go by fleece hearing a fleece
[1:15:44] there but you call me
[1:15:47] yourself
[1:15:50] amen mama
[1:15:54] thank other children
[1:15:57] he had power
[1:15:58] to heal the sick
[1:16:00] the Bible to do all these great things
[1:16:03] but you see the Great era that Jesus is
[1:16:06] setting forth in these people their
[1:16:09] error
[1:16:11] is to not do
[1:16:13] his will
[1:16:16] because somehow the focus they thought
[1:16:18] well if I do this and this and this all
[1:16:20] these other things I don't do God will
[1:16:22] Overlook that
[1:16:26] now notice the words of Jesus in verse
[1:16:28] 23.
[1:16:30] then will I profess unto them I never
[1:16:37] knew you
[1:16:40] now this is not knowledge
[1:16:43] of knowing their name he's not saying I
[1:16:46] never knew you existed this is the Greek
[1:16:49] word that was used
[1:16:51] to line up actually with the equivalent
[1:16:54] Hebrew word in the Old Testament that
[1:16:56] when a man
[1:16:57] would know
[1:16:59] his wife
[1:17:03] Jesus knew who they were he knew their
[1:17:06] name
[1:17:08] but what he's saying is I never
[1:17:11] had a relationship
[1:17:14] with you
[1:17:17] you never received my seed in your soul
[1:17:26] I imagine Demas
[1:17:28] or walk up there
[1:17:31] remember he was a Spirit-filled man we
[1:17:34] looked at it Sunday
[1:17:35] led to Christ by Paul
[1:17:39] yeah
[1:17:41] but yet there's such a difference in
[1:17:44] being able to do signs and wonders and
[1:17:46] even good works
[1:17:49] than a desire to obey now notice Jesus
[1:17:52] goes on to say I never knew you you was
[1:17:55] never my bride I never took you unto
[1:17:58] myself and overshadowed you and sowed my
[1:18:01] seed in you
[1:18:03] I never knew you now listen to these
[1:18:06] words can you imagine friend oh God I
[1:18:09] hope none of us sitting here tonight
[1:18:10] ever hear these words
[1:18:13] oh nobody under the sound of my voice
[1:18:15] ever hears these words
[1:18:20] depart
[1:18:23] from me
[1:18:26] now you know if we are going to set at
[1:18:28] the table the marriage supper
[1:18:31] and we are going to still cry
[1:18:35] until he wipes that out of our eyes
[1:18:40] I wonder brother Nathan how are these
[1:18:42] people going to react
[1:18:45] because when they get in the regions of
[1:18:47] the Lost there will be weeping
[1:18:50] and gnashing of teeth
[1:18:54] I wonder what kind of emotion and what
[1:18:57] kind of display
[1:18:59] that they will show Lord God
[1:19:08] I I I just can't imagine what they
[1:19:12] will be sinking
[1:19:14] they unload their self and they tell
[1:19:16] Jesus what they've done and then Jesus
[1:19:20] will say these words unto them
[1:19:22] I never even
[1:19:24] knew you
[1:19:26] what
[1:19:29] no
[1:19:31] look there's something wrong here that
[1:19:32] that just can't be right
[1:19:36] I preached I I I was in Africa on the
[1:19:39] mission field I I've done this and that
[1:19:40] and the other I never knew you
[1:19:45] I moved down your heart when you was 20
[1:19:47] years old about taking my name in
[1:19:48] baptism
[1:19:49] but I remember it as plain as day
[1:19:51] sitting there in that tent in the coast
[1:19:54] of Africa and you said if I do that I'll
[1:19:56] lose my position
[1:19:58] I can't do that the church will throw me
[1:20:00] out
[1:20:01] that was me dealing with you and you
[1:20:03] turned me down for a clerical position
[1:20:08] you turned me down to be a missionary
[1:20:11] with a denominational system
[1:20:15] so this is the words I say to you
[1:20:18] depart
[1:20:27] listen how he frames this
[1:20:29] ye that work
[1:20:32] iniquity
[1:20:35] now you do understand of course there's
[1:20:37] a difference in you falling short of the
[1:20:40] glory of God me falling short of the
[1:20:42] glory of God right
[1:20:44] we all have mistakes anybody had to
[1:20:47] repent of anything since Sunday
[1:20:49] okay I'll say the rest is going for a
[1:20:51] Pimp right now go ahead and do it right
[1:20:52] now and I'll go in with the service
[1:20:53] center
[1:20:55] but that's
[1:20:59] that's what Jesus said of these people
[1:21:02] notice the word that he uses here when
[1:21:04] he says depart from me ye that work
[1:21:09] iniquity
[1:21:10] look at this word it's Minister about
[1:21:14] labor for
[1:21:17] so you trade by
[1:21:20] so this become
[1:21:22] their business
[1:21:24] don't you understand that's what a lot
[1:21:26] of religion is
[1:21:27] it's just a business
[1:21:31] and may I say it's a filthy one
[1:21:34] because it conveys to people they can
[1:21:36] live any way they want to they can do
[1:21:37] whatever they want to don't you
[1:21:39] understand all of these television
[1:21:40] preachers and a lot of these led us
[1:21:42] seeing preachers they ain't nothing they
[1:21:44] ain't nothing in the world but a bunch
[1:21:47] of trafficking iniquity preachers and
[1:21:51] what are they selling what are they
[1:21:53] doing they're selling iniquity by
[1:21:56] telling their people oh it don't mean no
[1:21:58] difference if you wear makeup it don't
[1:21:59] make why God don't care it don't make no
[1:22:02] difference them bunch of holy rollers
[1:22:03] and that then people doubt that skirt
[1:22:06] Church all well that's just a bunch of
[1:22:08] craziness but well if it is what if our
[1:22:10] sisters lost by dressing Godly
[1:22:14] what if you lost if you don't
[1:22:17] I told somebody not long ago I said yeah
[1:22:20] we're the skirt Church in so much even
[1:22:22] our piano was one
[1:22:25] our keyboard wears one and our organ did
[1:22:28] wear one so we built another case for it
[1:22:30] let them laugh let them ridicule let
[1:22:33] them make fun but one day they will
[1:22:36] stand there before almighty God and God
[1:22:39] will say you sold iniquity
[1:22:43] you perfect inequity
[1:22:47] you understand what a lot of these
[1:22:49] churches are doing they are trafficking
[1:22:52] iniquities their business
[1:22:57] they traffic
[1:22:59] damnation
[1:23:07] hold on
[1:23:16] a minister about labor for labor for
[1:23:19] trade by
[1:23:22] to make gains by trading well of course
[1:23:25] they do gain more members
[1:23:27] ha ha oh yeah sure that's what a lot of
[1:23:31] folks want they may take some friends
[1:23:33] that's not just how you're in the
[1:23:34] domination either a lot of folks in the
[1:23:36] message
[1:23:37] are looking for preachers that'll rub
[1:23:39] them on the head
[1:23:40] oh don't get down where I live you know
[1:23:42] just kind of just kind of you know just
[1:23:44] don't remember and whether or not you
[1:23:45] know it more and more and more there are
[1:23:48] more message churches that don't want to
[1:23:50] hear the message preached
[1:23:53] they don't mind you're saying oh yeah
[1:23:55] God sent a prophet but they just don't
[1:23:56] want you to stand up telling what he
[1:23:57] said they don't want you accordingly
[1:23:59] said what do they want to hear the same
[1:24:01] Bible stories they hold heard when they
[1:24:03] was a Methodist and they don't want the
[1:24:05] prophet mentioned they don't want the
[1:24:07] word mentioned they don't want the Seven
[1:24:08] Seals they don't want the message why
[1:24:10] because Satan knows that's where
[1:24:12] rapturing Faith lays in the end time
[1:24:15] message of the last day oh my brother
[1:24:17] sister the Pentecostals preached the
[1:24:20] Bible stories the methodists preach the
[1:24:22] Bible story it did not produce a Rapture
[1:24:25] then it won't produce one now we've got
[1:24:28] to have a message of the last days a
[1:24:31] message of the end time it ain't enough
[1:24:33] to say oh yeah I believe God sent a
[1:24:36] prophet tell me what he said
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:46] oh
[1:24:50] but now you realize
[1:24:53] a real gift from God
[1:24:55] to a real son of God
[1:24:58] and actually be misused
[1:25:01] this is where it gets really tricky
[1:25:04] and dangerous somewhat
[1:25:07] people want gifts and they ask for them
[1:25:09] and pray for them
[1:25:13] and many
[1:25:15] promoted in that sense
[1:25:18] but they're such a responsibility that
[1:25:20] comes with it
[1:25:23] now I figure in the next little bit
[1:25:26] amens will be like hens teeth
[1:25:29] and some of it's going to get quiet even
[1:25:31] though I'm going to read to you what
[1:25:33] your Prophet said
[1:25:38] I'll see if you believe it or not
[1:25:42] the word became flesh 1954.
[1:25:45] I believe that I
[1:25:48] have misused
[1:25:50] a Great Divine gift
[1:25:54] of a prophetic gift used in a way of
[1:25:56] Divine Healing
[1:25:58] I don't think that it's encouraged God
[1:26:02] or cause God to think so much of me
[1:26:06] in doing so
[1:26:09] and somebody said
[1:26:13] y'all okay with that
[1:26:14] really okay okay I'll go on
[1:26:17] I was going through it anyway but it's
[1:26:18] just nice when y'all go along with it
[1:26:21] now you see if you were looking for a
[1:26:24] perfect preacher
[1:26:27] man alive I hate to tell you
[1:26:30] you're wasting your time
[1:26:34] there are no perfect singers perfect
[1:26:36] musicians and they show ain't no perfect
[1:26:38] laity
[1:26:40] and there ain't no perfect preachers
[1:26:42] there ain't no perfect prophets there's
[1:26:43] never been a perfect Apostle there's
[1:26:45] never been a perfect Pastor there's
[1:26:47] never been a perfect missionary
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:53] but you see people sometimes
[1:26:57] depending on what they do with god-given
[1:26:59] gifts
[1:27:00] now brother random there's no question
[1:27:02] about it I mean God used a man in a way
[1:27:05] that has never been used before and
[1:27:08] never will again as a matter of fact as
[1:27:10] he said if anything anything greater
[1:27:12] Rises they're higher better than this
[1:27:14] greater than this I am a false prophet
[1:27:18] and there will never raise anything
[1:27:20] greater than that
[1:27:23] but notice him now as he starts using
[1:27:25] this this gift now this is notice the
[1:27:28] years 1954 and he says that he believed
[1:27:31] that he had misused a Great Divine gift
[1:27:33] now was he using it for money you know
[1:27:35] better than that no was he using it for
[1:27:38] women no he was using it to help the
[1:27:41] people
[1:27:42] because he loved the people
[1:27:45] so you see if Satan can't get you one
[1:27:48] way he'll try to trip you up in another
[1:27:51] way and use your desire to say be
[1:27:54] genuine oh I just want to help the
[1:27:56] people I just want to help them that's
[1:27:58] exactly what brother Branham wanted to
[1:27:59] do he wanted to help the people now
[1:28:02] notice this in wine Bloomington this is
[1:28:05] 1961 a few years apart you see I'm
[1:28:07] trying to use a prophetic gift in an
[1:28:10] Evangelistic service that's the reason
[1:28:12] it don't work so well it doesn't African
[1:28:16] it does anywhere else but the United
[1:28:18] States anywhere else but here it'll work
[1:28:22] now actually what happened was in the
[1:28:24] United States and some parts of the
[1:28:25] world but in the United States this gift
[1:28:28] become a form of entertainment
[1:28:32] and you can watch the people in the
[1:28:33] prayer lines brother random would call
[1:28:35] them out and tell them this and this one
[1:28:36] and then if he would stop listen
[1:28:38] discernment and just start laying hands
[1:28:40] on the people and you can hear it in the
[1:28:42] prayer line the response of the people
[1:28:44] goes down the people quit shouting and
[1:28:46] quit hollering and praising the Lord and
[1:28:49] he'd say now he's still here he's still
[1:28:51] here and he said look here look here
[1:28:52] this woman here your name is so and so
[1:28:54] you've been so and so and then watch the
[1:28:56] people listen at them they'll go to
[1:28:58] riling again writing again their faiths
[1:29:00] will get up now what's happening
[1:29:03] they are looking at the sign instead of
[1:29:07] the commission
[1:29:10] praise the Lord
[1:29:14] now notice this as I was with Moses if
[1:29:17] you haven't heard this in a while doing
[1:29:18] good to listen at it it's a turning
[1:29:20] place in brother Brandon's Ministry
[1:29:21] September the 11th 1960. no matter what
[1:29:24] goes on how much I fall fail rather I
[1:29:27] fail miserably I should have never went
[1:29:30] ahead with them signs now listen what
[1:29:33] his confession is that wasn't the will
[1:29:36] of God
[1:29:38] I should have never went ahead of them
[1:29:40] signs that wasn't the will of God so
[1:29:42] here now we don't have a God that's
[1:29:44] Matthew 7. we don't have a man that's
[1:29:47] going to stand before God and he'll say
[1:29:49] well Lord I cast out Devils out on this
[1:29:51] and God say to him well depart from me
[1:29:53] no we're talking about a real prophet of
[1:29:55] God that loved the Lord and had a
[1:29:57] greater gift than my goodness in my
[1:29:59] opinion next to the Lord Jesus himself
[1:30:01] as a matter of fact the prophet said the
[1:30:03] Lord Jesus had more success in his
[1:30:05] ministry than he did his own when he was
[1:30:07] on the earth boy that's a hard to
[1:30:09] swallow in it but it's a truce when you
[1:30:11] look at it in reality
[1:30:12] but yet we're still looking at a Son of
[1:30:15] God and you said you know people say oh
[1:30:17] my goodness well you know what if
[1:30:19] somebody makes a mistake with a gift
[1:30:20] then we don't want them at all no we
[1:30:22] want real ones we want genuine ones but
[1:30:26] we've got to understand what God gives
[1:30:28] you that it's going to depend on what
[1:30:30] you do with it and then you will be held
[1:30:33] accountable for the way you administer
[1:30:35] that gift
[1:30:37] now notice this I should have never went
[1:30:39] ahead of them signs it wasn't the will
[1:30:41] of God but God's blessed it anyhow okay
[1:30:45] so something can be out of the will of
[1:30:47] God and God bless it anyhow
[1:30:51] but apparently God's got tired of it
[1:30:53] because his Prophet is changing some
[1:30:55] things here now notice he said but I'm
[1:30:58] ready to leave this mountain
[1:31:01] I want to go across Jordan I want to
[1:31:04] carry the commission now listen what the
[1:31:06] commission was from the angel of the
[1:31:08] Lord get the people to believe you
[1:31:13] get the people to believe you and when
[1:31:16] you pray nothing will stand before your
[1:31:19] prayer even cancer
[1:31:22] but it got to where if people didn't
[1:31:24] hear their name and their address and
[1:31:27] this and that and the other the
[1:31:28] commission didn't mean too much now
[1:31:31] listen carefully you say why are you
[1:31:32] saying this
[1:31:33] because I'm afraid our message ranks is
[1:31:38] hidden in the same direction
[1:31:42] that if somebody don't tell you
[1:31:44] something
[1:31:45] a certain evangelist travels around the
[1:31:48] world
[1:31:50] wanted to talk with me some time ago
[1:31:54] and he was at a certain place preaching
[1:31:57] and I had a prayer line after his
[1:31:59] preaching and a sister come up and told
[1:32:01] him whatever it was she wanted young
[1:32:03] sister
[1:32:04] so the brother prayed for go sister
[1:32:06] believe it
[1:32:07] so she stands there stops stands there
[1:32:10] looks at him
[1:32:12] did the Lord show you anything she says
[1:32:15] he said no
[1:32:17] did the Lord tell you anything
[1:32:20] no
[1:32:24] now you see if we're not careful
[1:32:27] we will so major
[1:32:30] on such things that it'll come to pass
[1:32:34] that people will not think they can get
[1:32:38] healed unless somebody is Discerning
[1:32:40] them
[1:32:42] or they feel something
[1:32:45] or they pass out or they fall out hey I
[1:32:49] believe in all of that but Jesus didn't
[1:32:52] say none of that when he sent his force
[1:32:54] in mark 16.
[1:32:56] come on now
[1:32:58] [Applause]
[1:33:00] I've been hearing more and more of it
[1:33:03] that people they come up in a prayer
[1:33:06] line and if you don't tell them well the
[1:33:08] Lord shows me this or the Lord says that
[1:33:11] or the Lord says that then they they
[1:33:14] can't believe don't you see what's
[1:33:15] happening we're coming to the same spot
[1:33:18] if we're not careful that brother
[1:33:20] Branham was himself
[1:33:26] so what was it that led it to this spot
[1:33:32] maybe I should go in the office and
[1:33:33] finish this sermon it might be safer for
[1:33:35] me
[1:33:37] you know what led it to this
[1:33:40] brother Branham
[1:33:43] not trying to be selfish not trying to
[1:33:46] be arrogant and proud because he loved
[1:33:49] God's people and wanted to help them so
[1:33:52] much that he took something that he
[1:33:55] shouldn't have and used it in an
[1:33:57] improper way because he saw it helped
[1:34:00] the people's weak faith
[1:34:06] amen praise the Lord
[1:34:09] now notice what he says
[1:34:12] all the Pentecostal people like Signs
[1:34:15] they like to see it the Bible said of
[1:34:16] wicked and adultery generation seeks out
[1:34:18] your sign but the commission was
[1:34:21] pray for the sick
[1:34:25] and tens of thousands times thousands
[1:34:32] that I have failed to pray for
[1:34:37] because they all desired the sign
[1:34:47] y'all doing good don't nobody jump up
[1:34:49] and run out so maybe it's nervous right
[1:34:50] now he says you got it in high gear
[1:34:52] ain't you that's okay just sit still
[1:34:54] you're doing good
[1:34:56] oh you see this is a reason
[1:34:58] that I can follow this man
[1:35:02] show me where some of these other TV
[1:35:04] guys will stand up and tell you there's
[1:35:06] mistakes
[1:35:07] tell me where some of the best is
[1:35:09] pastors well
[1:35:11] they'll preach on yours Ain't It Funny
[1:35:13] and never hear none of theirs
[1:35:16] come on now saying so sit down and look
[1:35:17] at me that way
[1:35:19] but this man was honest before God and
[1:35:23] honest before us so when I hear these
[1:35:25] people say he was a deceiver and he
[1:35:27] tried to do this and the other thing
[1:35:29] you're a bunch of idiots you apparently
[1:35:32] don't listen to very many tapes at all
[1:35:34] because he tells on himself more than to
[1:35:37] believe the sign ever told on him
[1:35:39] well Hallelujah come on now why because
[1:35:43] he's following God's pattern of the
[1:35:45] Bible That's the Way God's Bible did it
[1:35:48] told on Moses it told on David it told
[1:35:51] on Jeremiah he tells on us and brother
[1:35:55] random told on himself that's a real
[1:35:58] servant of God
[1:35:59] [Applause]
[1:36:07] now notice this honesty
[1:36:10] but the commission was pray for the sick
[1:36:12] and tens of thousands times thousands
[1:36:17] that I have failed to pray for
[1:36:21] because they all desired the son
[1:36:27] they all desire it
[1:36:30] now we won't ask for a show of hands
[1:36:33] tonight
[1:36:34] of how many in our building tonight
[1:36:37] if we was having a prayer line and
[1:36:39] brother Branham was here and that gift
[1:36:41] was there
[1:36:42] how many of us would want the same thing
[1:36:46] or could we walk through the prayer line
[1:36:48] and say servant of God you don't have to
[1:36:50] see no vision for me if you'll pray God
[1:36:53] will do it I believe it or you could
[1:36:56] stand when I turn and say you don't have
[1:36:58] to lay hands on me just look at me let
[1:37:00] me get in your shadow
[1:37:02] Hallelujah just say the word say it I
[1:37:05] walk off your well
[1:37:07] or would you want your name told I could
[1:37:09] understand if you were sick I could
[1:37:12] understand if you don't know what world
[1:37:13] you're in that somebody might need to
[1:37:15] tell you your name you've noticed since
[1:37:17] she was knee-high to a jackrabbit why in
[1:37:19] the world do you want somebody to tell
[1:37:21] you your name now well you want somebody
[1:37:23] to tell you what you had for breakfast
[1:37:24] you went to the doctor think that makes
[1:37:26] you more spiritual then more spiritual
[1:37:27] do you know God's Prophet said the
[1:37:30] greatest honor that you and I can pay to
[1:37:33] God is believe his word
[1:37:37] believe that's the greatest honor you
[1:37:40] could give the work of God a hundred
[1:37:41] million dollars that's not the greatest
[1:37:43] honor the greatest honor you can ever
[1:37:46] pay to God is take God at his word and
[1:37:49] say Lord I believe Lord I believe oh
[1:37:53] brother Tony he's going to stop having
[1:37:55] prayer lines no I am not but I want us
[1:37:57] to have them also know it it's a man of
[1:38:00] God passes out before you get to him you
[1:38:02] can say well glory to God I got close
[1:38:04] enough to then only I still believe I'll
[1:38:06] be well and the deacons laid hands on me
[1:38:08] but the Bible said they shall and I
[1:38:10] believe I'm going to get well in your
[1:38:12] world nobody discern me well shoot
[1:38:14] nobody saw no light over me or know this
[1:38:17] or that or the other over me have you
[1:38:19] got a word for me I do I've got a word
[1:38:22] for everybody here tonight that said by
[1:38:24] his stripes you are already healed I've
[1:38:27] got a word for you glory to God they
[1:38:30] shall lay their hands on the sick and
[1:38:32] they shall recover in my name they will
[1:38:35] cast out devil I got a word for you I've
[1:38:38] got a word from almighty God he cannot
[1:38:41] lie
[1:38:55] watch this in paragraph 163 the other
[1:38:57] day
[1:38:58] I was trying to work the ministry
[1:39:01] and I got it into the room and a man
[1:39:03] come on the platform and said now
[1:39:05] brother Branham wait a minute
[1:39:08] my case
[1:39:10] it's different
[1:39:13] I just got to know something
[1:39:19] I said well the doctor can examine oh no
[1:39:21] I don't want that
[1:39:24] I want to know right now my case is so
[1:39:27] different
[1:39:28] I said well
[1:39:30] I hate to do this brother
[1:39:33] went on into it the first thing you know
[1:39:35] the Holy Spirit he said praise the Lord
[1:39:37] I tried I said the rest you all come now
[1:39:39] let me pray for you well when I did that
[1:39:41] you know the next one and said my case
[1:39:44] is just as important
[1:39:47] as his
[1:39:50] then I got about six or eight
[1:39:53] close the meeting
[1:39:55] like to kill me
[1:39:59] now listen to these words I always
[1:40:01] wondered why that would do that to me
[1:40:03] it's because I was doing it wrong
[1:40:08] that's just a signpost pointing to the
[1:40:12] commission it's not the commission but I
[1:40:16] want to go across Oh Glory I'm going to
[1:40:19] go on across Jordan I want to get into
[1:40:21] that something y'all know where my faith
[1:40:24] let's let him talk about it yourself
[1:40:26] brother Brandon wanted something to
[1:40:28] happen to him you can see why he would
[1:40:31] have depended on them Visions you ought
[1:40:32] to send them Visions was the word of the
[1:40:34] Lord it was infallible
[1:40:37] it was infallible remember him tell him
[1:40:39] about the man that fell and all these
[1:40:41] tons of pressure building fell on the
[1:40:44] man and crushed his liver and my many
[1:40:46] many things then things even going to
[1:40:48] live and brother him said I told my wife
[1:40:50] oh if Jesus was here maybe he'd walk
[1:40:52] down there in that hospital he'd lay his
[1:40:54] holy hands on him and he said that boy
[1:40:57] be made well he said that boy stood with
[1:40:59] me you know and told some different
[1:41:00] things and he said oh but I'm a sinner
[1:41:02] oh but if God would show me a vision
[1:41:05] and he said then I told her well if God
[1:41:08] did show me a vision and I went down
[1:41:10] there it'd still be these same old
[1:41:12] sinful hands
[1:41:13] so he said I walked in there without a
[1:41:15] vision and laid hands on him he was in
[1:41:18] service that night of the next night one
[1:41:20] they didn't expect him to live
[1:41:22] don't you see if a brother of Adam it
[1:41:24] would have been so easy for him to
[1:41:26] depend on that oh there's nothing wrong
[1:41:29] with his hands there's nothing wrong
[1:41:31] with emotion unless
[1:41:34] unless we have to have them
[1:41:37] to believe we're healed
[1:41:43] [Applause]
[1:41:50] oh he says for my faith will rise to a
[1:41:54] spot that when I pray for the people
[1:41:56] he's being honest and son I want my face
[1:41:59] that I just pray for him
[1:42:03] remember him saying that if God showed
[1:42:05] him that George Washington was raised
[1:42:07] going to raise from the dead
[1:42:10] he'd invite the world to come and see
[1:42:11] him and say get him a chair and let him
[1:42:12] sit down and rest a while
[1:42:16] isn't it amazing though he didn't do
[1:42:17] that without a vision
[1:42:20] now the word says there'll be a
[1:42:21] resurrection I hope George Washington
[1:42:23] will be there and be part of it
[1:42:25] but brother bam didn't know that for
[1:42:27] sure that George Washington would so he
[1:42:29] couldn't call him out of that you can
[1:42:32] see for us it's hard to imagine we don't
[1:42:34] live in that realm of it and oh yeah
[1:42:36] I've seen Visions before myself but I've
[1:42:38] never lived in that realm that God's
[1:42:40] Prophet lived in it was so absolutely
[1:42:42] perfect
[1:42:44] he would challenge the whole world on it
[1:42:47] oh my
[1:42:49] God now notice he said I've leaned heavy
[1:42:53] on the signpost
[1:42:56] myself
[1:42:59] Lord you show me about this for I pray
[1:43:01] for him because I don't know what I
[1:43:03] might do
[1:43:04] listen to this response
[1:43:06] how cruel
[1:43:09] wow
[1:43:10] how cruel
[1:43:14] that was
[1:43:16] what if it was cruel then
[1:43:19] I ask you want to be cruel again if we
[1:43:22] do the same thing
[1:43:33] oh my
[1:43:35] god listen to this I asked the
[1:43:38] congregation
[1:43:44] okay TD Jakes I'm waiting bro
[1:43:50] all the rest of you
[1:43:51] how about you smiling guy down in Texas
[1:43:53] I'm really waiting on you man
[1:43:56] notice I didn't call him bro I just said
[1:43:58] May
[1:44:00] I like to stand and hear them
[1:44:02] give an honest sincere apology I've been
[1:44:06] wrong I've LED you wrong there are this
[1:44:09] caliber of man
[1:44:19] oh my I asked the congregation to
[1:44:22] forgive me the congregations of the
[1:44:24] world that's listening in on this tape
[1:44:26] forgive me
[1:44:28] I was wrong
[1:44:30] I should have never carried it out
[1:44:34] like that
[1:44:36] that wasn't his commission at the first
[1:44:38] place that was a sign pointing to the
[1:44:41] commission I should have prayed for the
[1:44:43] sick everywhere
[1:44:48] I would stand sometime and run 50 or 75
[1:44:51] maybe 40 or 50 discernments at one time
[1:44:53] each and every night is that right Gene
[1:44:56] Leo you're here somewhere that's in the
[1:44:58] meeting said sure that was the truth and
[1:45:00] what did it do when it left me and
[1:45:02] started home I'd forget where I was at
[1:45:06] want to know where I'd come from on the
[1:45:08] highway
[1:45:11] you mean to tell me God does that to a
[1:45:13] man
[1:45:15] no sir
[1:45:16] it was a man doing it to himself
[1:45:20] by taking a signpost
[1:45:23] instead
[1:45:25] of a commission
[1:45:28] so our commission is what mark 16.
[1:45:33] the prophet identifies it and says the
[1:45:35] first commission to the church was
[1:45:37] Matthew 10.
[1:45:40] heal the sick cleanse the leper raise
[1:45:42] the Dead
[1:45:44] then he reaffirms it again to the church
[1:45:46] in Mark 16. isn't it amazing
[1:45:50] as much as we believe in shouting
[1:45:52] and anybody tells you I don't believe in
[1:45:54] shouting you tell them they're a liar
[1:45:57] I do believe in Shout
[1:46:00] but Jesus didn't say these signs shall
[1:46:01] follow them that believe they shall
[1:46:03] shout they will but he knew everybody
[1:46:05] wouldn't
[1:46:06] aren't you glad he didn't say that's a
[1:46:08] sign you none shouters you'd be in a
[1:46:10] hurry heap of trouble wouldn't you
[1:46:13] do we believe visions do we believe in
[1:46:15] spiritual dreams so we believe in all
[1:46:17] that but was them words in the in the
[1:46:20] commission of Mark 16.
[1:46:22] wonder why Jesus didn't say that
[1:46:25] because he knew they would only be very
[1:46:27] few that would ever see Vision so the
[1:46:30] commission could only be you know way
[1:46:32] back under 300 years ago and then maybe
[1:46:34] there'd be another down there every 400
[1:46:36] years or 500 years that would see a
[1:46:39] vision but he made the commission to
[1:46:42] where seeing a vision or not seeing a
[1:46:44] vision shouter not a shouter jumper not
[1:46:48] a jumper you could still obey the
[1:46:50] commission of the word of God these
[1:46:53] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:46:56] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[1:46:59] shall speak with new tongues and the
[1:47:01] church said
[1:47:02] do we believe in these other things with
[1:47:05] all of our hearts but that's not the
[1:47:10] commission
[1:47:20] can y'all handle a little bit more a few
[1:47:21] more minutes
[1:47:28] now let me just say this and I'll get
[1:47:30] you up real sensed up real tight and
[1:47:32] then I'll read to you you do realize
[1:47:35] that in the the manifestation of the
[1:47:38] pulls of the prophet's Ministry
[1:47:40] that whenever he started explaining
[1:47:43] to the other preachers and so on
[1:47:46] actually brother Branham
[1:47:48] was the cause
[1:47:50] of the impersonations
[1:47:57] now I'll read it to you
[1:48:00] then you can say Amen
[1:48:04] now watch this
[1:48:06] so that's what he told me the other
[1:48:07] night
[1:48:10] said you
[1:48:12] caused
[1:48:14] a lot of carnal impersonations to rise
[1:48:17] who did
[1:48:21] now can you imagine an angel of God
[1:48:23] standing before you
[1:48:25] he crossed his arms I'll read it to you
[1:48:27] in a minute
[1:48:28] sit down with these arms crossed looking
[1:48:31] at him
[1:48:32] my brother Branham says what he says
[1:48:35] when you hear it it's like he's saying
[1:48:37] it with a Stern voice
[1:48:42] now again
[1:48:44] a lot of preachers ain't going to say
[1:48:45] this about Angelic visitations
[1:48:49] that he got all over me and rebuked me
[1:48:52] and done this and that and other you
[1:48:53] ever heard him preachers talk about that
[1:48:56] I wonder why
[1:48:58] let's tell the whole truth what do you
[1:49:00] say
[1:49:01] Now look for him whenever I gave my
[1:49:03] heart to God I I was I was in all the
[1:49:05] way when I come to the message then and
[1:49:06] now for 40 years by the grace of God I
[1:49:09] was in it all the way I'm still in it
[1:49:11] all the way so I am not forbidden from
[1:49:14] Reading quotes like this or preaching
[1:49:16] them
[1:49:17] oh brother Donny it'll hurt people it'll
[1:49:19] only hurt those that don't understand
[1:49:21] the truth you see if you're trying to
[1:49:23] make an idolater brother Brandon boy you
[1:49:25] can't take these kind of quotes but if
[1:49:27] you're wanting the truth you'll say
[1:49:28] thank you Lord for a man that told us
[1:49:30] the truth thank you for a prophet that
[1:49:32] would be honest
[1:49:35] now notice the angel telling him you
[1:49:38] caused a lot of carnal impersonations to
[1:49:40] rise and he said no don't let no one
[1:49:43] ever see this remember he said that
[1:49:45] third pull was not
[1:49:48] a public show
[1:49:53] I just sent this one who had been
[1:49:55] talking now this is from what is a
[1:49:56] vision in Chicago behind me stepped
[1:50:00] around in front of me it was him the
[1:50:03] angel of the Lord and he had his hands
[1:50:06] folded he looked at me and said just
[1:50:09] what I told you not to do
[1:50:13] I said yes that's right he said you see
[1:50:16] that first promise when you used to put
[1:50:18] your hand on the people and tell them
[1:50:19] what their trouble said the second poll
[1:50:21] was when you'd know the secret of the
[1:50:22] heart like I told you and said instead
[1:50:25] of you keeping that to yourself
[1:50:28] you tried to explain all about it and
[1:50:31] tell the people
[1:50:32] and when you did you didn't know nothing
[1:50:35] about it yourself
[1:50:42] is it just Mayors are getting hot in
[1:50:44] here
[1:50:49] now I'm gonna tell you one thing
[1:50:52] evangelic visitations don't correct
[1:50:54] other men around this message
[1:50:57] I have to question
[1:50:59] the angel
[1:51:03] I don't figure there's none of us ever
[1:51:05] walked where he did or ever will and if
[1:51:07] he needed correction how much do we need
[1:51:10] it
[1:51:12] oh my goodness I heard a vision of a man
[1:51:14] years ago said it was a vision
[1:51:17] he was caught up in a vision and caught
[1:51:20] up into heaven itself
[1:51:21] supposed to be a preacher of this
[1:51:23] message
[1:51:25] and whatever he walked into heaven Paul
[1:51:28] come and got him
[1:51:30] and Paul set him down in a chair in him
[1:51:32] and Paul sat there and started having a
[1:51:34] conversation and Paul started telling
[1:51:37] him how hard it was in life
[1:51:39] how tough his burden was
[1:51:42] how about God's sake as a dog said I
[1:51:45] said who in the world is this Feller
[1:51:47] think he is
[1:51:48] Paul you think Paul beyond the curtain
[1:51:51] of time is setting up her talking about
[1:51:53] the troubles he'd had down here in life
[1:51:55] he went through this big long rolled out
[1:51:58] deal I thought Bud who who told you that
[1:52:02] you was the main man because they sure
[1:52:04] lied to you you need to find who they
[1:52:06] are Paul told him this and Paul told him
[1:52:09] that oh brother he said Paul said I know
[1:52:12] brother you'll understand I can't share
[1:52:14] this with nobody up here can you imagine
[1:52:17] a person in a sea off of the body
[1:52:19] talking to a blown up stuffed shirt that
[1:52:23] don't even know the first letter of
[1:52:25] humility and Paul talking to him about
[1:52:28] some come on somebody let's wake up and
[1:52:31] realize Heaven is not full of arrogance
[1:52:35] and pride and selfishness it's going to
[1:52:38] be full of people that died to that
[1:52:41] stuff
[1:52:50] good Lord
[1:52:54] if y'all see me standing on the side of
[1:52:56] the road tomorrow we'll work for food
[1:52:58] won't anybody stop by me a hamburger
[1:53:00] you will all right thank you
[1:53:04] he said you don't know nothing about it
[1:53:06] yourself
[1:53:07] and you caused
[1:53:10] a bunch of incarnal and impersonations
[1:53:12] to rise up and you see what you've done
[1:53:18] you see friends how dangerous it is
[1:53:20] when we have God's gifts
[1:53:23] if we don't use them the right way
[1:53:27] well I believe in the move of God yes
[1:53:30] but all my heart
[1:53:32] I just don't want to see it go back this
[1:53:34] way
[1:53:36] that if you don't have a word for
[1:53:38] somebody if you don't say a vision for
[1:53:40] somebody they don't get nothing
[1:53:45] I believe in all of that
[1:53:49] but all of that is on as credible as the
[1:53:51] man who's telling you
[1:53:54] amen
[1:53:55] amen
[1:53:58] I know beyond a shadow of a doubt I can
[1:54:02] trust his word
[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:05] there's been all kinds of folks that's
[1:54:07] had dreams about Erica different ones
[1:54:09] have seen Visions about this and I thank
[1:54:11] God for every one of them but let me
[1:54:13] tell you where my faith is anchored in
[1:54:15] tonight God's written word
[1:54:18] God's written word
[1:54:21] Hallelujah by the way if I don't feel it
[1:54:24] and if she has good days and bad days if
[1:54:27] you have good days and bad days that
[1:54:29] don't change a thing if you've got your
[1:54:31] Revelation in the written word then you
[1:54:33] may not be able to get a hold of the
[1:54:34] sister that had a dream about you or a
[1:54:36] man that had a vision about you but
[1:54:38] brother as long as you've got an iPhone
[1:54:39] or a Droid you can be able to have that
[1:54:42] promise right there and read it to the
[1:54:43] devil every day by his stripes I am
[1:54:46] healed read it to him greater is he that
[1:54:48] is in me than he that is in the world
[1:54:51] yes thank God for the emotion thank God
[1:54:54] for shouting but the absolute is the
[1:54:57] word of God
[1:54:58] the absolute is the word of God gifts
[1:55:01] can be wrong
[1:55:04] God's word can never
[1:55:08] [Applause]
[1:55:20] well praise the Lord
[1:55:24] I guess I'll be the subject of some
[1:55:26] sermons for the next month or so but
[1:55:28] that's okay
[1:55:31] read with me Mark chapter 16 verse 15.
[1:55:36] and he said unto them
[1:55:38] go into all the world
[1:55:40] and push play
[1:55:43] what
[1:55:50] this is the commission from the man
[1:55:52] himself
[1:55:55] and if he felt like and knew
[1:55:58] that preaching would work up to so far
[1:56:00] and then at the last ages and I answer
[1:56:02] that y'all don't need to preach no more
[1:56:04] push play and obey
[1:56:11] but if you push play and Obey you'll
[1:56:14] have preachers in your church
[1:56:16] because that's what the types will tell
[1:56:17] you
[1:56:18] so it shows me that person played but
[1:56:20] they ain't no van or they'd have a
[1:56:22] pastor that preaches the word of God
[1:56:26] well Glory I know some of you wish I
[1:56:28] come with a remote
[1:56:30] some of y'all speed me up
[1:56:33] some of you back Pittman some of you
[1:56:35] jumped me from one thing to the other
[1:56:36] I'm so glad I didn't come with only one
[1:56:38] remote handheld by God himself
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:41] I see why folks don't want no preachers
[1:56:44] they can pick what they want to hear
[1:56:45] when they listen to a tape and they can
[1:56:47] start it here and stop it here and start
[1:56:49] to hear and stop it here that's why they
[1:56:51] don't want their High burn up living
[1:56:53] like a bunch of Jezebels and a worldly
[1:56:55] system brother I'll tell you we need
[1:56:57] some men of God in the Pulpit that'll
[1:56:59] preach the old-fashioned Holy Ghost
[1:57:01] Gospel that'll introduce Jesus Christ
[1:57:04] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:57:07] that'll heal the sick that'll clean up
[1:57:09] our lives
[1:57:10] [Applause]
[1:57:20] and he said unto them go into all the
[1:57:23] world
[1:57:24] and preach the gospel
[1:57:26] to every creature
[1:57:28] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:57:31] be saved and he that believeth not shall
[1:57:33] be damned
[1:57:35] and these Sons shall follow them
[1:57:38] that belief
[1:57:41] and my name shall they cast out devils
[1:57:44] they shall speak with new tongues
[1:57:47] they shall take up serpents which is not
[1:57:50] serpent handling churches
[1:57:52] these examples were displayed in the
[1:57:54] book of Acts and there weren't any
[1:57:56] serpent handling churches there was a
[1:57:58] preacher one time that's built in a fire
[1:58:00] and a snake showed up in the wrong
[1:58:02] woodpile
[1:58:05] he sizzled to his death
[1:58:07] he went ahead and grabbed a hold of that
[1:58:09] old thing and the devil thought boy I've
[1:58:10] got him now I'll take that old preacher
[1:58:13] out but actually it was a serpent that
[1:58:15] God took out because Paul shook him off
[1:58:17] in the fire that's what we want to do
[1:58:19] this is the Fulfillment of Mark 16 that
[1:58:22] old lust thing grabs a hold of you shake
[1:58:24] it off in the fire pornography grabs a
[1:58:26] hold to you sickness grabs a hold to you
[1:58:29] cancer grabs a hold to you hang it over
[1:58:31] the fire and say go on back to hell you
[1:58:33] devil go on back to hell where you come
[1:58:36] from let go of me you devil you ain't
[1:58:39] got no right to hold me now he'll stop
[1:58:42] shall I'm Healed by his blood I redeemed
[1:58:45] I'm set free Hallelujah
[1:58:51] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:58:53] not hurt them they shall lay
[1:59:00] they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:59:03] the prophet said it didn't even say you
[1:59:05] had to pray
[1:59:09] remember brother random talking about
[1:59:11] him doing an x-ray
[1:59:13] on the preachers
[1:59:15] on certain ones
[1:59:17] and when they take their hand out and
[1:59:19] put it on people's head
[1:59:21] it looked like fire lightning light
[1:59:25] coming out of their hands
[1:59:27] it wasn't every one of them they said
[1:59:29] just certain ones
[1:59:32] I've had a few of them lighting and bold
[1:59:33] preachers lay hands on me before
[1:59:37] you understand can you imagine the
[1:59:40] phenomenal of the supernatural God now
[1:59:42] look for it the Lord Jesus could have
[1:59:43] said their law see Visions they will all
[1:59:45] shout they will all jump that's that
[1:59:47] does not not the commission just for not
[1:59:49] careful we will insert things and our
[1:59:52] Focus will be oh just so give me a word
[1:59:54] brother give me a word I'm not making
[1:59:56] light of that
[1:59:57] but that's not the commission
[2:00:00] we're gonna look back if the Lord
[2:00:02] changed in a few years and say what
[2:00:04] happened to us
[2:00:06] now we're having prayer lines and people
[2:00:08] won't even they won't even believe
[2:00:09] unless you see something for them
[2:00:14] I got one more quote and I'm going over
[2:00:16] a little bit but I'm going to read it
[2:00:17] for you
[2:00:19] let's jump over just one Brothers to try
[2:00:22] and go to do God of service
[2:00:26] many times a man God can deal with them
[2:00:28] and give them a gift and the people will
[2:00:31] squeeze in on those people
[2:00:33] and if they're not perfectly called and
[2:00:35] sin of God he'll cause that man or that
[2:00:38] woman
[2:00:39] to say something that isn't his will
[2:00:43] because the people constrains them to do
[2:00:47] it
[2:00:50] how I had to catch our own little Pastor
[2:00:53] on it out here in the woods one morning
[2:00:55] about three o'clock in the morning said
[2:00:57] go tell brother Neville I come to you
[2:01:00] didn't I brother Neville
[2:01:02] everybody brother Neville prophesy over
[2:01:04] me
[2:01:05] tell me this or that you see you would
[2:01:08] have him saying things that wouldn't
[2:01:11] come to pass
[2:01:16] praise the Lord
[2:01:18] amen so you see with everything that God
[2:01:21] gives us
[2:01:22] we still have to use it in the right way
[2:01:26] how many once just use whatever God's
[2:01:28] gave you
[2:01:29] want to be sensible and responsible and
[2:01:31] you're singers your musicians well
[2:01:34] whatever it is that God's given you to
[2:01:36] the body remember
[2:01:38] a lot of it will depend on you
[2:01:40] how you use it
[2:01:42] what a blessing it will be and it may
[2:01:44] not even necessarily be the way you want
[2:01:46] it
[2:01:46] I've said it to you before and I'll say
[2:01:48] it again tonight and God is my witness
[2:01:51] if it was left up to me we would stop
[2:01:54] our internet tonight I would never
[2:01:57] stream it again
[2:01:59] I get shot at hate criticize ridicule
[2:02:03] people want to cut my head off and
[2:02:05] everything else and that's the message
[2:02:07] people
[2:02:09] much less the sinners
[2:02:13] but you know why I do it
[2:02:16] because I get a little later and I'll
[2:02:17] get some after this some of them right
[2:02:19] now is chomping their fingernails off
[2:02:21] today no dear God don't let him do it
[2:02:25] I do it because people
[2:02:28] here and there and everywhere some no
[2:02:30] church to go to
[2:02:33] so it ain't for me
[2:02:36] it ain't even necessarily for you your
[2:02:39] gift
[2:02:40] it may pull you as these deacons
[2:02:43] sometimes if everything about their
[2:02:44] position it's good and smooth and lovely
[2:02:50] no songwriters musicians
[2:02:56] but that's what a gift is given for
[2:02:58] not for you
[2:03:00] for others
[2:03:03] the sparrow hits together
[2:03:13] praise the Lord
[2:03:16] praise the Lord
[2:03:20] with all of our heads about here tonight
[2:03:22] I wonder
[2:03:25] maybe some of you are not even sure what
[2:03:27] you have what God's given to your charge
[2:03:29] your care
[2:03:31] maybe you're still
[2:03:32] really trying to sort through it all and
[2:03:34] just Lord what do you want me to do what
[2:03:36] am I called to do
[2:03:39] well if you're there tonight I believe
[2:03:41] that he can help you
[2:03:43] to be able to know what his will is for
[2:03:45] your life maybe some of you you're
[2:03:47] convinced
[2:03:48] at least for the present right now well
[2:03:50] I'm supposed to this and this and this
[2:03:53] maybe some of you have been in that for
[2:03:55] years and years
[2:03:57] but I dare say every one of us no matter
[2:03:59] what category brand of the three that I
[2:04:01] described
[2:04:03] I sure every one of us could say Lord
[2:04:06] we need your help
[2:04:08] I've been in my vocation of what God
[2:04:09] called me to be for decades of my life
[2:04:13] but I still need his help
[2:04:15] because I don't want to mess up
[2:04:19] he's given me different gifts in my life
[2:04:21] what will I do with them well I take
[2:04:24] them and pull them toward me
[2:04:28] me me me me God show me God told me God
[2:04:32] told me God showed me God shall make God
[2:04:34] told me
[2:04:36] if I'm the only person on the earth that
[2:04:38] God is talking to you folks should
[2:04:40] question it
[2:04:42] since we're in a body move
[2:04:44] donning just talking to one man or two
[2:04:47] men or three men
[2:04:49] God's name with his bride around the
[2:04:52] world
[2:04:54] how many of you'd like to be remembered
[2:04:55] tonight
[2:04:56] I would would you pray for me
[2:05:03] Heavenly Father
[2:05:07] I know it's it's been strange really
[2:05:12] last several Services have been
[2:05:14] so somber so serious so
[2:05:18] checkup time I guess would say
[2:05:22] Lord I Thank you for it because I
[2:05:24] believe it's
[2:05:25] in the right seasons
[2:05:28] I pray Lord
[2:05:30] begin with me tonight
[2:05:32] help me
[2:05:35] Lord God what little you've given me
[2:05:39] help me that I'll always be responsible
[2:05:41] with it Lord
[2:05:43] that I'll never abuse it I'll never use
[2:05:45] it wrong
[2:05:47] I'll never turn it toward me or
[2:05:50] this our church but it'll always be
[2:05:54] turned towards you
[2:05:56] and what can bring you glory Lord we
[2:05:59] we don't need no glory we deserve none
[2:06:03] Lord forever man woman boy girl that's
[2:06:06] your present those that have streamed
[2:06:07] the service
[2:06:10] would you help each of us
[2:06:12] some of them may never prophesy they may
[2:06:15] never speak in tongues I may never be
[2:06:16] the emotional type that'll run up and
[2:06:18] down the hallways of the church and
[2:06:21] scream and be really loud and we thank
[2:06:24] God for that I I love to see Sons and
[2:06:26] Daughters of God dancing and worshiping
[2:06:29] God in the spirit I love to see it
[2:06:32] but yet I know all of them won't do that
[2:06:34] because that was not in the commission
[2:06:37] so what if the commission was
[2:06:39] what will be in the body every body
[2:06:43] it will be there
[2:06:45] every assembly
[2:06:47] that's where you want it you could have
[2:06:49] included many of these other things
[2:06:51] but you chose the ones you wanted
[2:06:55] so then you add other things
[2:06:58] we thank you for people who can have
[2:07:00] dreams and they come with no symbols
[2:07:02] which a prophet told us without a
[2:07:04] prophet in the land to interpret it a
[2:07:06] Dream from God will not have a bunch of
[2:07:08] symbols
[2:07:09] so it'll not be three stars hanging over
[2:07:12] three goats and fourteen cows over in
[2:07:14] the left and 32 trees on the right and
[2:07:16] then we come out there and say well I
[2:07:17] think it meant this or that or the other
[2:07:19] well according to the message of the
[2:07:21] hour unless they're a prophet they ain't
[2:07:23] got no right to interpret that
[2:07:26] yet Lord we know people want to be so
[2:07:28] spiritual so they will have a dream and
[2:07:29] have all kinds of symbols in it and they
[2:07:31] go to interpret it and I'm thinking my
[2:07:32] goodness
[2:07:34] I guess we just think it don't matter
[2:07:36] we want to be so spiritual because
[2:07:38] somehow we think those things make us
[2:07:41] more spiritual than obeying the word
[2:07:45] Lord help us
[2:07:47] help us to realize how you love
[2:07:50] obedience
[2:07:52] how you love obedience
[2:07:55] well father I pray
[2:07:57] from now until the Rapture comes
[2:08:01] least lies in our assembly others can do
[2:08:03] whatever they want every church is
[2:08:04] sovereign
[2:08:05] I pray for every time that we come up
[2:08:09] for prayer for every individual whether
[2:08:11] it's individually or we have a prayer
[2:08:13] line or whatever
[2:08:15] that my church
[2:08:16] does not think
[2:08:19] that I have to see a vision over them
[2:08:22] or have a have a word as that would be
[2:08:26] said
[2:08:27] but that I can lay my hands on them and
[2:08:29] they've got confidence and they'll walk
[2:08:31] away and say by the Lord Jesus Stripes I
[2:08:34] am healed
[2:08:35] then if you give a vision to somebody or
[2:08:38] a dream to somebody praise God will
[2:08:40] accept that as long as it's right as
[2:08:41] long as it's true
[2:08:43] but our greatest honor that we can give
[2:08:46] to you is believe your word
[2:08:51] help us I pray Lord God in the name of
[2:08:54] Jesus
[2:08:55] may we be able to leave this place
[2:08:57] tonight and Ponder I know they will
[2:08:59] they're going to think about it and
[2:09:00] they're going to be talking about it and
[2:09:01] no doubt people will be talking about it
[2:09:04] on the internet oh my goodness you're
[2:09:05] what Brother Don he's preaching oh what
[2:09:06] in the world is he getting is he doing
[2:09:08] away with this Supernatural Lord you
[2:09:10] know better than that anybody knows me
[2:09:11] knows I'm not
[2:09:13] I just don't want us to get to the same
[2:09:15] spot that brother Branham got to
[2:09:19] and he missed praying for thousands of
[2:09:22] people
[2:09:22] thousands of people miss their healing
[2:09:26] because other people there had to have a
[2:09:29] son
[2:09:30] and it wore him out so much
[2:09:33] that the people couldn't even get prayed
[2:09:35] for
[2:09:36] but thank you for his honesty Lord
[2:09:40] oh praise the Lord anybody in here
[2:09:43] tonight
[2:09:44] want to just say Lord
[2:09:46] I want to take you at your word
[2:09:48] I want to be the kind of Christian
[2:09:50] that I can take you at your word I won't
[2:09:52] have to have to ask the preacher did you
[2:09:54] see anything you got a word for me would
[2:09:57] you feel anything
[2:09:58] uh well you got you got something
[2:10:00] special well if the preacher says yeah
[2:10:03] by his stripes you are healed brother
[2:10:05] praise be to God
[2:10:08] help us Lord to give you the highest
[2:10:11] honor we can give we can take you at
[2:10:14] your words
[2:10:16] oh we worship you tonight Jesus
[2:10:19] we bless you father
[2:10:22] Lord I'm not trying to chide them I have
[2:10:25] walked in these shoes before Lord
[2:10:28] the reason I can tell them these things
[2:10:30] because being a former Pentecostal I
[2:10:34] know how I was oh how I depended on
[2:10:37] signs
[2:10:38] how I would seek after those I told them
[2:10:41] not long ago of some instances in my
[2:10:44] life I know what it can lead you to and
[2:10:47] you had to let me fall flat on my face
[2:10:50] to break me away from it
[2:10:52] and Lord it breaks my heart when I see
[2:10:55] some of the message people going in the
[2:10:57] same way that I was in when I was a
[2:11:00] Pentecostal
[2:11:02] and yet a lot of the message people have
[2:11:03] never been in Pentecost so they really
[2:11:05] don't have a clue what it's all about
[2:11:08] and here I am Manhattan to others of us
[2:11:10] that's been in there and we see some of
[2:11:12] the same stuff coming around again
[2:11:14] not a repeat
[2:11:16] of the original Acts 2. but a repeat of
[2:11:20] Azusa Street
[2:11:22] we don't want that Lord
[2:11:24] we don't see what that messed up
[2:11:27] we want the original
[2:11:29] the original Hallelujah
[2:11:34] Lord God your Prophet said the American
[2:11:36] people had to be entertained
[2:11:39] I hope they can understand that's what
[2:11:41] they wanted him to do with the gift
[2:11:44] entertain them
[2:11:46] I pray our church does not turn into
[2:11:49] that type of a church
[2:11:51] that we have to be spiritually
[2:11:53] entertained
[2:11:55] but Lord God may we as your people be
[2:11:57] able to ask for prayer
[2:11:59] and walk away from there if we don't
[2:12:01] feel anything it means absolutely
[2:12:04] nothing
[2:12:05] if we didn't have a sensation if the
[2:12:08] preacher didn't see a vision over us or
[2:12:10] or give us a direct word from God we
[2:12:14] walk away from there and we believe and
[2:12:18] in a few days or a month or however long
[2:12:20] it happens because we take you at your
[2:12:24] words
[2:12:26] granted Lord God
[2:12:28] would you lay your hands on one another
[2:12:30] tonight
[2:12:32] now if you notice when Jesus sends his
[2:12:34] commission he doesn't even say that it
[2:12:36] was just limited to preachers only
[2:12:39] Carol got a testimony just this week
[2:12:41] from from one of the sisters and had a
[2:12:43] baby that was suffered
[2:12:45] was no preacher around so this sister
[2:12:48] just laid her hands on her baby herself
[2:12:51] and ask God to move well you I guess you
[2:12:53] know the rest of the story God moved why
[2:12:56] because Jesus said they shall lay their
[2:12:59] hands on the sickness and they shall
[2:13:01] recover
[2:13:03] no doubt no doubt there's sicknesses and
[2:13:06] diseases and troubles and heartaches and
[2:13:08] all kinds of things in this place
[2:13:10] tonight
[2:13:11] how many all believers with me we want
[2:13:13] to believe for our brothers and sisters
[2:13:15] right now
[2:13:16] praise God brother Daryl maybe you can
[2:13:19] come but him and pray for the people
[2:13:22] Hallelujah
[2:13:24] Hallelujah
[2:13:26] if you feel it that's wonderful
[2:13:30] but it's still wonderful if you don't
[2:13:31] because you're taking God at his word
[2:13:35] and if you walk out here and say well
[2:13:36] everybody around me shouted but I didn't
[2:13:39] feel one thing don't base it on that
[2:13:42] pay God the highest honor you can pay
[2:13:44] him
[2:13:45] you believe his word
[2:13:51] just believe
[2:13:54] almighty God
[2:13:57] we bow in your wonderful presence this
[2:13:59] evening Lord
[2:14:00] you believe in the promises of your word
[2:14:02] to be true Dear God
[2:14:04] for Lord heavens and earth will pass
[2:14:06] away at your word shall never fail Lord
[2:14:08] and in obedience to your word tonight we
[2:14:10] lay our hands upon one another father
[2:14:13] God into the commission that's been
[2:14:15] given to us Lord and I've seen you do so
[2:14:17] many wonderful things when the saints of
[2:14:19] God would take you at your word Lord and
[2:14:22] call on your name on behalf of the
[2:14:23] brother and their sister Lord to see him
[2:14:26] delivered God of afflictions to seal
[2:14:28] delivered dear God of depression and
[2:14:30] oppression and diabetes Lord and
[2:14:33] arthritis and cataracts and glaucoma and
[2:14:35] oh God there's nothing too great for you
[2:14:38] tonight father so Lord I pray May the
[2:14:40] holy spirit that wrote the word dear God
[2:14:42] may it come and confirm it tonight I
[2:14:44] pray As We Lay hands upon one another

[2:14:49] May the sick be made well oh God May the
[2:14:52] depressed be lifted up in Joy dear God
[2:14:54] and may every promise of your word
[2:14:56] become the past in the lives of your
[2:14:58] people tonight father for Lord the same
[2:15:00] word that said we shall lay hands upon
[2:15:02] the sick that same word said we shall
[2:15:04] take Rapture dear God and Father we
[2:15:06] believe that word to be true Lord and
[2:15:08] we're moving towards it now and
[2:15:10] obedience to your word father we curse
[2:15:12] the enemy that would come against us
[2:15:14] tonight in the name of Jesus Christ by
[2:15:16] that same minority that raised our Lord
[2:15:18] from the grave May that save anointing
[2:15:21] who gave my daughter back to me May that
[2:15:23] same Authority tonight move above the
[2:15:26] hearts of the people dear God and may
[2:15:28] the chains fall off May the change loose
[2:15:30] tonight from the people that we can go
[2:15:32] free for you said in your word whom the
[2:15:35] son has made free is free indeed Satan

[2:15:40] on us I rebuke you tonight in the name
[2:15:43] of Jesus Christ leave these people for
[2:15:45] the glory of God As We Lay hands on one
[2:15:48] to the other to the other May the
[2:15:50] liberation of the Spirit come Lord and
[2:15:52] may we lift up the hands in Victory we
[2:15:55] are not a defeated people we are the
[2:15:57] Overcomers of this hour and every devil
