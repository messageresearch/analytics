is a liar can I sing that second verse again oh and he told you were troubled you'll forever be alone when he told you you should run away you'll never find a home when he told you were dirty and that you should be ashamed when he told you you could be the one the grace could never change your fear is a liar he will take your breath stop you in your steps fear is a liar he will rob your rest still being as cast your fear in the fire cause fear he is a liar oh cast your fear in the fire cause fear he is a liar [Music] [Applause] Americans say Amen to that today and has been afraid serving the Lord's been afraid yeah me too I'm afraid right now every time I get up to preach I get afraid a slice-facing every day of life and now we're living we just never know what a day will hold do we we never know what the world is going to do and everyone will know what people are going to do of all the things that we face in this day I'm so grateful that we have a stability in the Lord to be able to help us Psalms 37 verse 3 Brother Louis already announced it but there'll be a youth service Florida tomorrow brother Rob asked me to speak at that service so from 40 and under and maybe even some of you that's eight or nine but Jack you kind of feel young the more you can come young at heart Psalms 37 3. trust in the Lord and do good so shall thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed this is the scripture I know I've quoted it to you a lot in the last 36 years Delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart that is a broad spectrum of a scripture listen to it carefully again Delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart how can God do that how can God make such a broad statement that he will give you the desires of your heart all but you see that's not the first part the first part is Delight thyself also in the Lord so your Delight will regulate your request so a real child of God who serves the Lord with all of their heart they're not disposed to ask of anything knowingly that would be against father's will so that's why he could make such a bold statement that if you delight yourself in the Lord there's no way you willingly are going to ask for anything that you know would displease him so this is why God can put it in this way and this is why that he will grant it to you notice in verse 5. commit thy way unto the Lord and trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass what your desires hmm you can see why he can't give this to everybody only those who Delight in him and Those who commit notice the word he used our commit thy way unto the Lord so your desire is toward him your very happiness is built on pleasing him oh you want to try to get along with everybody as much as you can but ultimately God is first if you have to cross a mama your Crosser if you have to cross daddy or whoever it is you cross them because God is the one you want to please first commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass Matthew 18 19. again I say unto you that if any two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name are we here today for that reason that purpose there am I so I hope you come today with that in mind this is not usual this is not church as usual this is while I'm going to church today Jesus is here so whatever you got need of he's here this is his promise that's not me it's not you it's on anyone else here that made that for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them I mean he's got a request today on your hard desire petition let's just take it before the Lord Lord Jesus we counted such an honor to be gathered together again today in your presence in your house we thank you Father for each one that has put forth the effort to come today and we're just believing that you'll honor their efforts their sacrifices of coming to the house of God we pray father not only for the visible audience but for those that are invisible those who would love to be here today and sick and can't come those Lord that are streaming in different parts of the earth we pray that you'll be mindful of them today Lord and and their needs and Lord as we have come here we have many many needs in our homes and our lives our bodies our church we bring them before you Lord we never knowingly would ask anything contrary to your will we want your will above all things though sometimes your will is opposite of our will but we really want your will because our will is what's got us in so much trouble so we pray you would make your word real to us today that we can walk out of this place with a new understanding about what you desire for us in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated how many believes these scriptures are true now turn with into Mark chapter 11 verse 23 and then I'm going to ask you again how many beliefs this scripture is true this one is one of the most profound scriptures to me in the New Testament as far as the way that the Lord Jesus put it and it was one that actually stumbled the prophet himself now not stumble to unbelief but stumble to understand to try to comprehend what the Lord Jesus was saying notice this Mark 11 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain now I want you to get to the setting before we go to the next part of this verse the Lord Jesus is down in the Kidron Valley now for those of you who have been in Jerusalem you know Jerusalem is built upon a hill and then there's a valley that comes down like this on the Eastern Gate which is where they believe the Messiah will come into there's a gigantic graveyard so you go out the Eastern Gate you come down through here here's the graveyard go down through the Kidron Valley and then you'll come over to absalom's tomb you go down to the Church of all Nations which is where the garden is supposedly The Garden of Gethsemane was at so here's the city comes down like this down through our Broad Valley and then you start ascending on the other side now there's another Mount here of Mount scopus and also called the Mount of Olives and the Mount of Ascension is called several different names now the Lord Jesus is standing there on the proximity of the city so he tells them now if you will believe in your heart now the reason this question has been raised is because he had come through just a day or so prior to this and it cursed a fig tree and he looked at the fig tree and it didn't have no fruit on it so the Lord Jesus cursed that fig tree now what's amazing is it was not actually even time for the fruit to be on the tree but he wasn't doing this out of season remember prophets work in symbols so he cursed this fig tree because the Fig Tree was a type of Israel so he curses this tree and he says Lord no fruit hence Forever Grill on you well they turn right back around and they come through within another day or so and whenever they do they look at the Fig Tree and the disciples are just they're just overwhelmed they said Lord look at the tree look look at what happened to the tree now no doubt they didn't understand it it was more than just that tree but it was Israel's future because Israel was like the Fig Tree so he had come to them and they had produced the fruit now the Fig comes forth in several different stages so by this stage the Fig Tree had sent forth the precursor of the fruit but yet the fruit there was none there even in the pre-fruit states so he saw that the tree was not going to put forth what it should do and it was the same with Israel as a nation they should have recognized him they should have known who he was they should have believed him but they didn't so what did he do he cursed them now then from verse this verse prior to this then Jesus turns and then he says that that apostles were just surprised mesmerized by what had happened and then we go in to what Jesus said you're in Mark 11 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain so he turns from the Fig Tree which would have been there in the Kidron Valley somewhere on the side of the mountain and he turns and says now whoever will say to this mountain so he turns maybe turns his body around and he's standing looking like this so there is the Mount of Olives who will say to this mountain now we know he's not literally speaking about the mountain itself but he was speaking in a parable because that mountain the Lord Jesus Will descend upon that mountain according to the book of Zechariah the prophecy and he will come so that scripture could not been pertaining to that mountain literally but it was a parable but he wanted to just blow their minds he wanted just so blow their sinking to what they thought Faith really was so he turns to the Mount of Olives and said you think that's something I'll say to you that if you will believe and not doubt in your heart and you'll have faith that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea now that within itself would have been a pretty phenomenal thing you're going to say to a mountain be thou removed and the Mount of Olives will pick up and be cast into the sea anybody know where the nearest sea was the Sea of Galilee many miles away now the Lord Jesus says something that seems like an impossibility but he wanted to do that in order to get them to focus on what the church can really do if they'll see who they are now also said no one ever moved the mall of Olives anyone even speaking about it per se but it was what is called a hyperbole which is something that is stretched out so far beyond reality in order to show you a spiritual symbol so he's saying something that will never happen something that absolutely he never intended to happen but he wanted to use something in a parabolical form that they would look at it and look at one another and say you've got to be kidding me you mean if I really believe I could say to the Mount of Olives be thou cast into the sin of course they were From Galilee and they knew how far it was from there to Galilee so a miracle to be able to speak to the mountain and the mountain be plucked up and another miracle that by your word that mountain would carry in the air for miles and miles and miles and miles and be set down in the Sea of Galilee you see when you look at it in that setting it's no wonder that the scripture so stumped the prophet and it would cause him to Marvel at why the Lord Jesus would say it this way how about that minus read it again verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe though that those things which he says now this is what got the prophet it wasn't what God Said it's what you said well I guess we might as well dismiss and go home from the looks of y'all's faces you mean a person could receive something from God in such a way and God would use their mouths to say it and if they believed it was God even as great as a mountain could be moved out of their way I notice this be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith I wonder how many of us are there today you know see my hand's flying up do you I wonder how far we are Church beneath what the Lord wants us to be now we thank my goodness to disbelieve God's word that's a terrible thing and it is but can you imagine god making a word so real to you that it would be a sin for you to believe disbelief your praise the Lord now as I said it's not church as usual today now God knew that that on the earth that would ever Embrace This Promise but he said it nonetheless it's not said for the masses the majority of Christianity people never even understands such a thing notice verse 24. therefore I say unto you the master saying unto the servants what things so ever ye desire When you pray believe that ye receive them I want you to notice a word that Jesus did not use here in the receiving part and it was Will or shall but can you imagine a person that when they believe it they actually get it right then now this is not my words my words will be debatable You could argue these are not words to argue with this morning listen again carefully I'm speaking to you now about the bride's rights therefore I say unto you that what things so ever ye desire When you pray believe that ye receives them and you shall have some now notice he doesn't put the shall before the receive but with real face you believe that you already have them before you actually get them now I want you to notice this word I looked at it this morning and studying on it for a bit the simple little word received and most of us probably feel like we know what it means but just give me a few minutes just to verify it for you now he says if you will believe that ye receive received the word receive means take lay hold of any person or saying in order to use it to take what is one's own so it's already yours now what are we talking about we're talking about substance faith which is perfect faith it's a step beyond our intellectual Faith to where we sat and hear it preached over and over and over and over again and then we build up a knowledge about it yes I believe Malachi 4 I believe Mark 16 I believe Saint John 14 12 these Saints are fall then they believe I believe I believe I believe I believe and that's good nothing wrong with that but you and I have faced things in our life that intellectual faith will not conquer it takes the face of Jesus himself I don't believe that our face alone will ever meet The Challenge of the hour that lays before us I believe it'll take this Faith right here so I want you noticing that Jesus uses this word in the Greek Aramaic language and that this was the meaning of it to take what is one's own so it's already been revealed to you that it is yours and what you're doing the word receiving is that you're taking what is already yours God's done revealed it to you and the work is over it don't matter in heaven it's what the doctor says what anybody else says as far as you're concerned it's a finished work to take what is one's own to make one's own to claim of that which when taken is not let go to seize to see so to receive then is to seize upon the Divine promise of God made personal to you by divine revelation you seize your possession even though you do not have one physical proof one material proof one scientific proof that one thing has happened but you don't even care because to you it is already substance now we're talking about perfect Faith so what is perfect Faith what differentiates it between that and regular Faith well regular faith faith is the substance of things hoped for with the evidence of Things Not Seen and that type of faith will do lots of things many of the New Testament miracles in the days of the Lord Jesus it was that simple Faith they heard about a Son of God they believed it was the Messiah and their needs were great and they simply believed it they did not have a bible to read they did not have tapes to listen to they had no New Testament preachers there were no such a thing but their needs were so great and the gospel in its simple stage was able to touch the common people and they heard the word and they believed it and if you notice many times when the authors would write they would talk about how desperate their needs was the sorrowful Nation woman having a daughter that was grievously vexed of the devil it does not mention how great an understanding of the word was it was the need was so great and so pressing and so against them they needed help so bad you understand what I'm saying so it wasn't like that they had this great Paramount revelation of the word they really didn't it shows they didn't understand who he was because some of them that got healed were part of the throng and the multitude that cried a little while later crucified this guy he's a blasphemer so it proves they did not have real Revelation Faith but yet they had faith that was momentary they had faith that was a pulsation something that dropped down and they were able to get what they need at the time but it never LED them to Salvation never LED them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost nothing wrong with that type of Faith but I want a faith that'll lead me on don't you I don't want to just be healed I want to be say I want to be delivered I want to be filled with the Holy Ghost I want to be raptured ultimately out of this world so I want you to notice now that the Lord Jesus is bringing something to the apostles that no doubt they must have got together later and talked about did you understand what he was saying what about you did it make any sense to you I don't understand what in the world he was getting out because he's saying that we could actually say something well he had given them the pattern of him cursing the Fig Tree he's fixing to tell him of course further on in the gospels and Matthew that whatever they would bind on Earth would act should be bound in heaven he's also going to go on and tell them whoever sins that you remit they are remitted and whoever sins you retain they are retained oh my yo I believe the church God's representative on the Earth is going to come to her full position before we leave this world in a rapture now notice the Lord Jesus bringing in the gospel and I wonder how many years it was before they first began to really understand these passages of scripture I know that some of you read them for years I'm wondering how many of us said here today and understand them now does this mean that we're going to go around and just say things well this is going to come to pass and that's going to come to pass and this is going to happen now we've seen a bunch of that stuff we want it to be only when God sovereignly gives it to us now can that happen to a person that's not a preacher of course you can't I'd happen to a woman that's filled with the Holy Ghost yep sure can but it will not be at will it will not be whenever we say well I want this to happen tomorrow we don't have no say when it happens how it happens or who it happens to it is sovereignly given by God remember the question answer 64. brother Branham if you were pressed upon would you speak someone into a certain condition now the prophet catches that question to me it sounds like a muddled up mess but he caught that question and said now the person here has got a very good question now he said what they're saying and what they're referring to they didn't say this of course but he said what they're referring to is the speaking of the word now the person was asking that if they themselves were in a state a spiritual State and they could not overcome something override something what a profit able to speak the word and speak them into a state of perfection now then brother random answers this and he says well you know that's a really good question but they said they're referring to the speaking of the squirrels and all that but he said if you don't notice that was sovereignly given brother random did not ask for squirrels brother random did not ask for that to be despite unhatti right is that right he did not ask for his own wife he did not ask for those things but something dropped down in the room where he was what is that something or should I say who is that something so it is not something that we as the people of God will control at will well today I'm going to go out and I'm going to empty the hospitals tomorrow I'm going to go over here and I'm going to do that the Bible never teaches any such nonsense the apostles never done that they were led by the Holy Ghost so I think it ought to really motivate us to be closer to God than we've ever been in our entire lives and the Saints said so Faith accepts this as it's as good as done even though the actual answer is still in the future Faith accepts it as if it's already done though the evidence may not be made manifest for quite some time and the church said now would you notice how Jesus then goes from this great revelation of faith into verse 25 Mark 11 25 and when ye stand praying now that breaks some of our traditions because we think God only hears us whenever we kneel but actually if you'll study the Jewish custom you'll find out that they did much of their praying standing up for those of you who have ever been to the Wailing Wall or the Western Wall as they call it and it's the remnants of some of the blocks of stone that was part of the herodian temple and they in the years later they come and lined them up and there's big cracks inside of those stones and those Jews come in Christians as well and they will write their prayer requests and stuff them inside I mean absolutely tens of thousands of them they've done it for years and years and years and whenever they stand there and the real Jews you don't have to wonder really who the Jews are because whenever they stand there they will read a portion of the book of Psalms and when they stand there the men will stand there like this and they will have the little skull cap on the back they make you as a gentile also wear one I wore one whenever I went down there I didn't stand there and do this because I didn't really think I needed to but they stand there because they say that you cannot read the book of Psalms without getting stimulated I kind of do like that idea though but they would stand there and you didn't see any of them or I never I've been there a couple of times I never saw one of them or the Rob actually kneeling down so they were staying and I think it's a trick of the devil to get us in our mind thinking that our body has to be in a certain posture before the Lord will hear our prayer but the Lord Jesus said when you stand pray well if it's more reverent to be kneeling wouldn't he say that now those times that I actually prostrate myself before the Lord and I will lay flat on my face flat right down on my body totally right down on on my face before the Lord and I will lay there till ever I get done but I don't do that all the time because my nose is big enough and I sure don't look like a D9 hit me in the face so but you know in our thinking in the Satan does that to rob you so that you think that you can't pray on the job and you can't Pray when you're at Lowe's and you can't Pray when you you can pray almost anywhere at any time and it's nothing but the devil to try to convince you that the Lord Jesus only hears you well that's not what he said himself so notice now how it's going to bring into perspective of perfect Faith another great great thing he said when you stand praying and forgive now we've gone from speaking the word and God dropping a Rhema word inside of your mouth and you speaking that word and you believing what you've said will come to pass they can imagine when brother Brennan was there and the squirrels in Kentucky whenever this happened and he was so overwhelmed so he began to speak let the one come here it'll do this that and the other and he shows spots that a squirrel does not go it doesn't go through Poison Ivy and it doesn't go through here and there it just won't do it but he spoke it that way because he wanted to prove that it was something Supernatural and divine and yet but whatever he said Here I Am Lord something's happening here I am beside myself what in the world is going on and he got up and he was ready to leave and the voice said but you said so many you said do you doubt what you said do you doubt what you said no Lord no Lord he sold the sign himself no Lord I believe where will it come speak it now God was not speaking it but the prophet was oh Lord children don't give up on your family don't give up on your sons your daughters your grandkids your family members that God keeps burning you for and you say oh if I could just get your mother wrong oh if I could get your brother Tim if I could get your mother down maybe that speak a word Maybe but what if God wants to use the mouse of the mother what if God wants to use the mouse of the father when the father is down praying and all the sudden the Holy Ghost so comes in the room where he is and he knows it's not his own word it's not his own inspiration but he says it in the name of the Lord Jesus I claim my son for the kingdom of God that devil that is holding his life let go house of hell you can no longer hold my son my daughter my wife my husband and by Your Word God will set them free now don't sit there look at me funny I believe that the Holy Ghost is not only in the ministry I believe the Holy Ghost is in the body of Christ [Applause] Hallelujah now I want you to notice that Jesus speaking is such a great thing about faith but notice what he ties in with such great faith and when you stand praying forgive wow so we're just talking about speaking the word and then he goes from speaking the word to forgiveness why because you will not be able to have this open Channel between you and God if you've got a spirit of unforgiveness now I know this probably ain't for nobody here this morning but I'm going to say it for some of them sorry dogs that stream the services and some of you little angels here you better with me and give me a few minutes will you while I'm dealing with whoever this is out there where's them cameras out this morning all right you sorry thing let me get a view up here and you up there maybe maybe it's our brother down and Patagonia Chile Where I got an email from him where he was talking about the services were they seem can you imagine down there I'm painting Chile all the way down in South America and God is reaching people oh yeah he's reaching them all over the world why he's getting the people ready to go for the Rapture so maybe you said that brother there but let me say this you'll never be able to move and that type of Harmony was God if you have an unforgiving spirit now there's a great difference and an unforgiving spirit and you and I with our human makeup may be being made in such a way and there's certain strains that run in families that some families find it very hard to forgive people that's not necessarily a spirit it's a trait or a nature that runs in that family now I don't expect amends for the next little bit maybe some of them on the internet can at least just blink their lights or something so let me know or hurt somebody thank you there brother but yet there are some people that really really struggle with being able to forgive people now when people will trespass against them and hurt their feelings and maybe say something and we've all been there and done that haven't we we've all had our feelings hurt we've been disappointed and let down by people and I dare say probably most of us have hurt as many as have hurt us if not the other way around well go ahead and say Amen you might as well we want to let on like we're the ones that get hurt all the time our mind is too fat and we're all too much blabbermouths to tell me that we've not hurt people with our fat jaws and our mouth flapping when we ought to be quiet and listening preach Melody well Hallelujah so the Lord Jesus now is bringing this in what I find astounding is if you get time and you'd like to listen to this message entitle perfect faith that when the prophet reads this very scripture here in Mark 11 and then he bases the subject perfect face on these scriptures I just read to you this morning and then right after reading the scripture they're the very next words that he says in the following paragraph is so we see that faith is based upon forgiveness oh amen I thought that Faith was based upon hearing the word well that type of face is but now we're looking at a face that is beyond just what church members have let me tell you something friends the more you look into uh you know a lot of these folks that don't believe there's a God and we evolve from a monkey and we evolve from an ape and some of that stuff you know I've been looking at some of the stuff of what they say and I realize it takes more faith to believe what they believe that it does for you and I believe in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth I mean we just got a simple faith and we believe it to believe a one cell deal got out there in the middle of a green pond scum and it turned into all this stuff we got today that would take a lot of things amen but yet you realize that this element of face now with an intellectual Faith a person can believe God tap into certain aspects of the promise of God and still will be one that does not forgive yeah because it won't really hinder their intellectual Faith because they think they're all right and they will hide behind that Flaws by the iron mentioned here Wednesday night didn't he do a beautiful job well that's just my family it's just the way we are well you see your intellectual Faith we'll make excuses for that but when you break into this realm of Faith now you're standing without your prayer for a loved one God my daughters got to need my son's got to need all Lord I need a word oh God I need something I know while you're praying that way all of a sudden you remember you did something to somebody or said something to somebody wow what a peculiar time not really because if you're in the spirit of prayer it's the best time for God to deal with you when you stand praying for give So Divine forgiveness toward a Believer and a believer's forgiveness toward another believer are associated together in reality you cannot not have the Deep degree of one without having the Deep degree of the other those who cannot forgive men their trespasses aren't truly forgiven before God oh Jesus Hallelujah well sit there and look at me and then I'll read you the scripture on it and then I'll look back at you when I do now notice when you stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven you mean mind forgiveness is based upon my forgiveness whoa whoa I thought my forgiveness was based upon him you see if I don't forgive people then my day to forgiven I don't get this mixed up my forgiveness of being a sinner is already taken care of and that can only come from him but what we're talking about after a child of God is your daily forgiveness that every one of you including me need every day of your life now do you understand you not forgiving someone else does not mean that you're not a Christian no that comes by the initial forgiveness of the Lord Jesus but your daily forgiveness will stop when you for refuse to forgive someone else so you say something wrong you do something wrong you look at something wrong you have a bad attitude temper you know whatever it is and you say the words oh Lord forgive me oh Lord forgive me but he actually does not because you'll not forgive so and so their trespasses against you praise the Lord can I go on y'all want me to stop go on all right so watch now so Divine forgiveness now remember this is not human forgiveness this is divine capability Divine forgiveness toward a Believer is linked together with his Divine forgiveness back to you now remember these are the words of the Lord Jesus we believe it right notice verse 26 but if ye do not forgive oh my goodness neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses you mean so me receiving daily forgiveness is stopped halted comes to a screeching halt until I can forgive whoever it is that has done me wrong praise the Lord wow could this be one reason why we don't see a greater manifestation of God's presence in our midst oh it's so much easier to let your hair grow out sometimes and your brothers quit whining this and that and the other and quit doing this and that that's on the outside this is inside stuff this is inside stuff forgiven nobody even knows him maybe your wife or your husband don't even know that you've got a grievance or you've got an all against someone you have and you go to pray it bothers you I don't know I need to I know I need to I'm going to fix that thing one of these days why not today why not today go ahead and declare war on it today and say by God's grace I'm going to put this thing under my feet oh my brother Donnie you don't know how bad I've been hurt I'm sure that I don't and I'm sure you don't know how about I've been hurt since I've been a Christian most of my life so you know you don't expect you don't expect really much out of Sinners but out of Christians you expect them to be people of honesty and integrity and character right and you expect them to love one another and pray for one another and so on and so on and so on so where's my greatest hurts come from where's yours come from Christians anybody say Amen women who have you been the most disappointed in uh the guy down at the bar or the guy somewhere you know robbing a bank he really disappointed you why you shouldn't that's the way he is or has it been Christians that you went to church with now you see these are inseparably linked together but my husband I'll tell you what he done so and so I'll I'll never forgive him which means God will never again forgive you let's read it again the words of the Lord Jesus and Word of Life says [Music] but if ye do not forgive neither will your father so we're not talking about Chris sinners now holding grudges but we're talking about real children of God and so much that Jesus called these children the children of God and call God their father you mean a Christian can hold such an unforgiving spirit and an unforgiving attitude don't nobody about a nine now don't nobody's cheeks turn all red because you'll tell on yourself sure is the world a Christian can do that yes my brother sister I've met him around the world around the world and you and I have you we all know how we are as human beings and we are so faulty and so flawed some people have no problem at all being able to see all kinds of faults I mean they can see it they look this way they see it they look that way and the only Direction they see no fault is when they turn their eyes toward their self and they see God's perfect holy example of a Christian and they just don't understand why everybody else don't want to be just like them God only had one example and that wasn't you it was the Lord Jesus himself praise the Lord so a person then can have a level of intellectual faith and be able to make certain Promises of God come to pass maybe they can break into the aspect of being able to tithe and give and they'll say God said give and it'll be given unto you shaken down press together I'll call men to give unto your bosom they don't live right a bit more nothing but yet they will finance I've known of people over the years that were not even Christians and they would support missions and they would support radio preachers and television preachers remember I was a Pentecostal so I worked with a guy that was on television I worked with him and him for years I was there with him and I knew a little bit about the finances and there was people that was business people coal operators in that part of West Virginia and they would give him thousands times thousands of dollars and they would have been more Christians than Nelson and God would bless them and bless them financially and they found that out and they worked on that one promise of God you say that into messages yes it is spoken words original receipt now notice in God don't just want his bride to all to be able to operate on the aspect of tithes and offerings on the aspect of receiving Divine Healing God wants us to operate on the ultimate aspect that one day we will be looking in the mirror and the sweep will come over our bodies and we'll be changed we're not just this this this disciple ends with this generation do you understand this cycle of life and death has been ongoing for thousands of years I believe I can say about all of my heart and not be out of the continuity of God's word I believe in this generation the cycle of life and death and burial will be interrupted forever I believe there are people in this building today who will not die but will be changed by the power of God it's going to take more it's going to take more faith in Wesley it's going to take more faith than Pentecost it's got to be an end time faith for an end time people for an end time revelation [Applause] so here you are you're praying on your face and your closet standing wherever it is you really need something from God you're desperate oh God I need I need I need this I need that and sometimes we don't even know what we need you know what I'm saying we get down we just don't even watch him pray for I've been there many a Time he just don't watch even asking but I'm glad I've got another language or two or three or four when I don't know how to pray sometimes I don't know how to pray for people and I'll pray and I'll pray and then all of a sudden I just let myself go and I'll start speaking in another language and every time he ever does that there's not a time that I don't see Divine Deliverance which that's crazy that ain't the message you need to listen to the message a little more as a matter of fact you'll find God's profit being there in a hotel room and Bill it coming to getting respect and brother man was down praying and he said he'd heard somebody thought speaking in German and they were speaking so fast and he said he thought I want you to listen to that man he is speaking so fast and he said come to find out it was me literally brother brought him no they were springing a woman across on the highway oh I think it was a 35 Chevrolet and the woman that hurt her body was in terrible terrible shape and her body began to bleed in Hemorrhage out in the back seat of the car and they pulled the woman out of the car on the side of the road and thought the woman was going to die brother random said it was an urgent need her angel come down in the hotel room where that Prophet was and begin to take his Mouse and pray out of him words he did not even know well come on somebody begin to pray out of him words that he did not know and the angel of the lord well they finally come on but God moved for the woman they brought wrong to the meeting course she's having a spell who wouldn't even some of the word alive folks might have shouted a little bit here at the point of death and God resurrects you and brings it up there and they run a microphone down there and said what time did this happen and they said it's a certain certain time it was the exact same time the prophet was down in the motel room and the spirit of God he said once that happened he felt like he could run the loop through a wall and run through a troop and vice versa why because the presence of God had moved in such a way all but we're messaged people right we don't believe in the Supernatural speak for yourself I believe we need the supernatural power to God greater than we've ever I'm not talking about fanaticism I'm not talking about 1906 Pentecost I'm talking about the original baptism of the Holy Ghost with fire coming down changing our lives hey but if you listen now us here today if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses I don't know that's you I cannot imagine living one day with that scripture applying to me now maybe some of y'all are better than I am maybe I'll live closer to God than I am I sort of doubt it since I know most of you rotten sorry outfits not how much you're selling I'm talking about your body you ain't gonna tell me oh everybody comes there's angels of the Lord but have these preachers preaching the way they're preaching if everybody hears Angels they'd be preaching on the horizontal Rainbow on the dimensional light and so on and so forth but they preach on forgiveness and arguing and fussing well that tells me a whole lot right there that pretty well describes everybody around the message around the world don't it and that will be the great Paradox that God will be able to consummate the prophecy of his word with who Angels no human beings that were born lost human beings that were born contaminated what all types of flaws and failures and faulty things about them but the baptism of the Holy Ghost goes inside of their soul and changes them and makes them a new creature and little by little quote by quote take by tape service by service they say Lord I'm sorry I didn't realize I don't make it right Lord I'm sorry I'll make it right brother don't every time I go to church I'm hearing more about myself that ain't right well I'll say praise God to that that means the lord loves us and he wants to get us ready to leave this world if he didn't love you he would leave you where you are oh my God praise God so you're praying Lord Jesus please father help me and my family Lord please help me and all of a sudden you know that feeling you've got against so and so now Lord that ain't you that's that old devil get out of here devil isn't it amazing when we're in prayer and then something comes up now if that happens again about 383 times that I lacked on it is it any Wonder that we don't get any farther in Christ Jesus Saint John 15 7. if he abide in me and my words now we've looked at this before but this is not logos but Rhema click on it when you get home all you gotta do is go to the words here in your in your Bible and you can click on the word and it'll open it up to the Greek Lexicon it'll show you the meaning of the word it's Rhema that which applies for the hour what you're needing the current need notice how Jesus says this so if you abide me in my words my rhemas about you this is why folks can be full of logos and still miss the rapture that's what folks don't understand the necessity of a message in the end time well friends people have been reading this Bible and said in this Bible for thousands of years how studying the Bible alone produce the Rapture come on don't get quiet on me has it no people have had healing campaigns for years it's had healing campaigns produce a Rapture absolutely not it's having signs wonders and miracles I've seen all that in my Ministry and Pentecost I've seen all kinds of signs and wonders I've had science following my Ministry ever since I was a boy preacher it didn't just happen when I come to the message I had great science and Supernatural wonders why because that's what has taught us what I believed but yet we got to have more than that we've got to have more while we believe God sent a prophet yes we believe God sent a prophet but what did he say once he got here so if you abide in me about words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will not what I will but if you abide in me and my Rhema is abiding you then ask what you will but there again if this is happening in you you'll never ask him intentionally for anything that would be out of his will you know why his will and your will from your soul are the same thing now not the will of your flesh that's why it's all gone more than anything I want your word God more than anything I want to do what you want me to do your flesh don't want that but your soul if it's born again what's it want God I want you a will nevertheless not in my will but thy will be done so if you abide in me and my Ramos abide in you that ask what you want cause I know these category of people now categorically Jesus is speaking to a very small minute group of people down through a 2 000 year span of seven Church ages that would only be a few that would ever be able to grab this scripture and he would say this is yours this is your S I said that Senate brother Jason Watkins church and they like to pass out when I said it and I'll say it to you all there are certain scriptures in the Bible I have no desire to fulfill somebody's going through the tribulation period I don't desire to fulfill that one somebody's going to get to mark of the beast I don't desire to full vote somebody's going to stand before him and be judged and call them false anointed ones I don't desire to fulfill that one I do desire to fulfill this one if he abide me and my words abide in you ask what you will look friends look we can judge where we are spiritually in Christ Jesus by measuring the distance between our Wills that's your cage it's not the anointing it's not running it's not emotion we believe in all of that but yet we want to judge where we are about the gauge of our will our will and proximity to his if you abide in me and my words abide in you then I will give you this Freedom ask me what help me Jesus ask what what be done not maybe not perhaps it will be but the Criterion of this verse must be met you see people will quote this and then they're like well I want this or that the other uh God I ask in the name of Jesus and he told himself well that ain't true yes it's true but they did not meet the requirement of the Criterion that God demanded if ye abide in me and my words abide my words live my words motivate my words are your pleasure my words are your desire my words are what you live for Oh Glory to God while I go to church once a week whether I need to or not I pay my tithes and I can afford it I help the witty when I can afford it no you're not abiding in the word oh if you abide in me and my words about you they live there constantly they got you they lead you they correct you they encourage you then when you get that dead eyes what you will [Applause] [Music] herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples oh you see they were first called Christians at Antioch today the term Christian is one that's been accepted now of course for several millennium but in that day to be called a Christian was not complementary at all it was Christos like Christos cristianos christianos so that's what the Romans would call them christianos and ridicule and Scorn and make fun of them but remember Jesus did not call his disciples Christians he called them disciples and what does the word disciple where does it come from the word disciplined so you disciple or you discipline how many used to get disciplined when you were little I talk about one two three four boy I've got my high tanned a few times now I don't mind telling you my daddy whenever he would come at me toward that big hand I think Lord that hand look like it's a foot wide and a foot long look like Goliath's hand coming at me and most of the time bless his heart he'd done it when he was mad when daddy woke me when he was mad that day and that made Donnie very sad well I probably didn't get near enough so Mama didn't want me that much the last one you've heard me tell it the last one that Mama gave me was I was fixing to get married in a few weeks Mama stood about that tall something like that and I said something smart to her I was fixing to drive to school I was a big boy now I had my license fixing to get married to that little lady setting over there before long so I figured I'd say some things I'd been wanting to say for a long time didn't take me long to realize I should have kept my big mouth shut when my little mama got done with me you know what I'd done I cooled off a little bit after she warmed me up and then I went and gotten my truck and went to school cried like a baby of course but you know what I realized not only did I cry cause Mama hurt me but I cried because I'd been so disrespectful to my mama I paid such disrespect to her because she loved us so much and yet discipline it's something that's so hard for Christians in this day our nation is where it is because she refuses the discipline of God our nation is turned into hell come on don't get quiet I mean that's why sodomy is rampant everywhere and it's not only rampant in the world but remember in the type it was there in sodomy where did Sodom where did lot wind up in the cities of Sodom look here the sodomites was knocking on lot's door look out at the denominations the denominations are open they're they're Church doors to trans and they're open their Church doors to drag shows or what they need it's a good display of the Holy Ghost instead of a bunch of dried coins getting our damn in the minds of the poor little kids come on don't sit there and look at me and yet we wonder where God is we wonder why God's not in the midst of the how can almighty God come to a nation who will allow such in their church and in their military come on somebody but if we will humble ourself and let the Lord God come into us and say God Walk with us cleanse us teach us help us Lord I believe the greatest things we have ever seen in our lives lay right before us foreign well I didn't even get to our Bill of Rights a whole few people out there and the internet's happy now you took my whole sermon and hijacked it from these bunch of little angels here they come to church all dressed up with their son to go to meet and close on and they come to be patted on the head and rubbed on the shoulder you bunch of sorry Sinners out there oh there might be one or two in here oh don't you love him you see these things we cannot manufacture all I used to sit in Pentecost were people would manufacture gifts and they would call people out Prophet tells us in the church age book they will operate a gift with a margin of error in it now you say it don't mean that everything about it is wrong but a margin of error oh my Harvest Time December 1964. brother Brown says Satan can hand out them Supernatural gifts by the handfuls can you imagine Satan handing out Supernatural gifts he'll do anything to get your focus off of God's word my some of them guys that I thought was so gifted come to find out that a girlfriend over here and one over there and one over there huh live one way in front of the people and live another women that's out by theirself but myself I desire to see Holiness righteousness purity when I say hold on I'm saying just talking about her sisters neither I believe this message of course homeless for the brothers uh-huh now we want to preach homeless and preach all over the women one got some of the Stars man there ever was hanging around the churches well preach brother Donnie may God help us may God help us what if God has allocated a word for your daughter or your son or your husband and that word cannot be spoken by God himself it cannot be spoken by an Angel it can only come through your lips God is waiting on you to get to a place to where when you pray this person will come up before you in that one and that one and you just kind of push it back and push it back but when you stand up before God and as John said and if our hearts condemn us not then we know we have the petition that we ask of him let me know something you stand before the Lord and there's nothing there absolutely nothing maybe I'm weird but this is what I do all the time I go before the Lord and just want him to do a scan and we're familiar scans in this day right CT scans you know all kinds of scans and tests and this and that that's the way I want the Lord to do me I just tell him search me Lord is there anything you see in me that you don't like is there anything that displeases you is there an attitude is there a demeanor about me is there anything that you don't like about me please let me know please I give you my word as your son I'll fix it is that what y'all want me to live well would you really want a pastor that when you get in real desperate need three o'clock in the morning and it takes him two days to get back with you because he's got so much stuff he's got to fix I might be dead but then I want a man if I want to be a sheep and I'm going to fall a Shepherd I want a man that lives right does right walks right and when I need him you don't have to have 14 all the calls to get right with God himself he stays right he stays right now what you want that's the kind of parents you need to be for your children and young people that's the type of young people you need to be maybe for other young people you're going to church with they might need you because sometimes they'll talk to you when they won't talk to me they'll talk to you when they won't even talk to Mom and Dad and if they're talking to you and you're kind of cold yourself and you're thinking oh my goodness I'm in worse shape than they are I can't help them we need to stay ready 24 7. Christianity is on call every day of the week and it ain't just for the pastor or brother Donnie I want you to live right on Sunday well I want to live right on Monday because the Lord may call me on Monday you don't want to just live right on Sunday you want to live right every day of the week and if God drops a word in my mouth what if God will give me a word for your son a word for one of yours you want me in and out and up and down and wishy-washy and cold and on fire and cold and on fire having attitudes in my heart and this and that another you want me that way you don't and that's fair of you because if I don't live the right kind of life you need to get rid of me according to the Bible an elder is supposed to be blameless which I'm afraid would disqualify some of our message preachers because they're troublemakers liars deceivers how can a man be a pastor and be that friends as we get closer to the end I think every day ought to be checking up time I'm under such anticipation for our dedication Services aren't you I mean Carol was telling that yesterday but I told her I said you know what I'm under anticipation for tomorrow and Wednesday and next Sunday and Wednesday and next Sunday I don't live from camp meeting to camp meeting I'm one of the guys who preaches a lot of them okay so I live from camp meeting to camp meeting I'm talking about like from Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday to Thursday to Friday to Saturday to Sunday you don't know when he's going to call you and I don't either we don't want to live right today and we'll go out and do whatever tomorrow we want to live right every day of our life [Music] but I might not need him brother Donnie no but I might need you and if I need you cannot depend on you can I depend on you benaught with God that if I pick up the phone and call your house and say please pray for me please I'm going to this well brother Donnie we'll get back with you we'll get back with you on that uh there's a few things and I've got an unforgiving spirit and I've got this and that you know what I'm gonna do call somebody else which is what you ought to do let's live right do right then God Hallelujah when God can trust us we thought we're something cause he's trusted us with Doctrine wait till he gives you Ramos I've told you I've met the little sister in India several years ago not a preacher of course not a leader of a church just a little humble simple sister in the time of famine and God performed the miracle the book of Kings and the life of this sister her meal Barrel never run out and a bottle of oil never under I met her I talked to the Pastors in the vicinity them pastors have been there and ate with that meal and watch the meal be pulled out of the bottom of it and every drop of the oil go out and she'd bake them some bread and then go back in the kitchen for round two a little sister that wasn't a preacher I couldn't even pronounce her name I don't remember her name now but apparently she was pretty important to God don't get your mind on preachers or this great person this great great great there's only one great one Among Us that's the Lord Jesus I've made a lot to be remembered today honest and sincerely nowless let's approach him and while we're standing here praying if the Lord places something on your heart Lord I I've spoken evil against the pastor Lord I I've said something against my brother my sister my God I don't want that in my way please help me Lord please help me heavenly father is we stand praying as you told us to do Lord God we ask that you would do a great God scan over each of us today we're grateful for what medical science has been able to do and the CT scan the Pet Scan the MRI all these things they can do and it shows things wrong in our body but they don't have one that can go in the soul but I believe the Divine scan is right here this morning Lord I only planned on spending a few minutes on this but you had other plans so I believe you've spoke to us today Lord so I pray begin with me Lord Jesus don't start with the deacons don't start with the trustees the song leaders but begin with Me O Lord scan my heart my soul my mind my temperament everything about me may my soul pass under your skin my spirit what I do the music I listen to the places I go who I fellowship with who I talked to May everything about me Lord God pass under your skin and father I know I can trust you to be honest and give me a true report of what my scan says I don't think I have to wait till tomorrow I don't think I have to wait till next month to schedule an appointment but I'm asking you now Lord if there's anything in my life that displeases you make it known to me Jesus and father I pray when you thoroughly scanned me may you begin at this pulpit and work backwards if you please or however you wish Lord God make you scan every man every woman every boy every girl father those streaming the service in France and Norway and Iceland and Africa and Patagonia wherever they are Lord God scan every heart every man every woman every boy every girl every preacher every sick person every well person Lord Jesus May Our Lives pass before your great skin Hallelujah Lord God we don't want anything innocent don't please him help us Lord God oh Jesus we worship you now we bless your Holy Name father We Worship You Lord that's it Lord that's it just go right among the congregation now scan their soul scan their spirit their motives their objectives hallelujah hallelujah oh Lord we want this word to be fulfilled in our lives Lord if there's a backslider someone that's lost dear God that you would put their word in our mouths may we be in season and on time oh Lord that we would be able to speak maybe a mother maybe a father standing here today I know there are I can feel it pulling and I know well enough to know the parents some of them are concerned about their children Lord God help them to realize how important it is to live every day because that word might arrive tomorrow whenever you'll put it in their mouth we know it was not brother Branham that told how to write what to say it was her choice if she wanted money she could have had money whatever she wanted it would have fell right in her lap what an awesome presence that must have been that day but what did she ask for The Souls of her boys what a great thing now the prophet couldn't say it until she said it Hallelujah so God was waiting on Hattie the prophet was waiting on the Hattie her boys was waiting on heaven a little insignificant woman that the world would never know much about but almighty God Hallelujah gave a word thank you for that story Lord oh Jesus I pray make it real to everyone you're today who has children that's not where they need to be loved ones that are out cold and different father in the name of Jesus Lord God I think of those that are sick today I think of those Lord we've got some that's sick and then we've got some that are desperately sick Lord no doubt some of them come and they think well baby God will give brother Donnie a word maybe brother Daryl will say something maybe they're waiting for the special meetings that may be so but Lord it may be you that just drops it in their heart they're sitting out here in the doctor's report and all of the sudden they become in tune with another voice Hallelujah that's saying the exact opposite of what the doctor is saying hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Lord God make us father make us people of such honor and character that we can reflect your glory we don't desire to be anything Lord It's not that we're asking that we can be something we don't want to be nothing we just want to be what you want us to be oh Jesus we worship you now father can we just raise our hands in the presence of the Lord how many did God speak to your heart here today God bless you let's just open our hearts to him now praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord Hallelujah if you will not doubt but believe what you have said you shall have what you say but remember when you stand and praying forgive can't you see why friends some folks will never go on any farther than they are because they just can't forgive they just cannot get the past out of their mind every time they see this person or that person or someone mentions their name that a one forgiveness just raises up in their hearts oh my is it really worth you holding on to would you forfeit your son coming back to God would you forfeit healing for someone else if there's someone here today that God would give you a word to speak to my daughter I would beg you I would plead with you I would get on my knees and crawl to you from this Pulpit if you're in the back if you're outside I would get on my knees and crawl to you and beg you please let your life be in harmony with God but you could speak that word for my daughter wouldn't you do the same what about your son your son some of your loved ones your husband your wife God is calling us to a higher call friends oh praise the Lord we don't want to just dedicate this building to God we want to dedicate ourselves to God oh praise the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let me just start to have a rededication of yourself right here before the Lord today Lord whether next month Carol and I'll be 67 years old you know you've heard me tell it many times I got saved when I was 12. started preaching when I was 18. but today I'd like to have a rededication of my life to him oh but you're an old man now believe me I know it I know I am but I still want to rededicate what I have left my ears my strength my energy aren't we glad for these Elders that are here among us we look around we've got Elders brothers and sisters brother Harvey I was talking with him the other day and him telling me him and sister Shirley was actually dating when brother random was here got to be in the Rapture service and some of the other services I thought my goodness we're so blessed to have people like that standing here Among Us other people that's been around for years and years don't we appreciate them that we want them to give up now no we need them we need them Hallelujah can we pray for each other would you mind just laid your hand over on each other Hallelujah Lord Jesus we don't know what the needs are today but father we have our hands so you don't want her brother or our sister we're asking you Lord God in the name of Jesus if we stand here praying today and you bring anything to our heart help us to fix it or Jesus we want to be your servants most of all as David captured it so many years ago Delight thyself also in the Lord God may it be said of each of us that we Delight ourself in Jesus I wonder how many of our people here today can honestly say Jesus Christ and his word and church and living for him and doing what's right is their greatest Delight it produces such happiness here's the key Lord Delight thyself also in the Lord and he will give Thee the desires of that art oh Jesus we pray and forgive us today of our shortcomings forgive us of our failures Lord forgive us O Lord any unforgiveness that we're holding in our heart forgive us Lord if anyone is trespassed against us and we're still holding that God Lord I've got too many too many people here today Lord that are looking to you not me for me to compromise and well if I preach that it'll hurt your feelings I'm going to tell them the truth if they get so aggravated at me because they'll love me after a while I want to bring on the truth Lord it may burn them a little it burns me too but Lord we want the truth we love you Jesus use this father not for our Glory not for our honor all we know some people in the message if they would have stood there before the Mount of Olives and they would have spoken the Mount of Olives would have picked up and been cast into the Sea of Galilee it wouldn't been that night everybody around their Circle would have known it they'd have told everybody and their brother and then we wonder why more don't happen Among Us I wonder sometimes if we're not bragging on herself instead of bragging on you the way I look at it a real servant of God can be just as happy when a miracle happens at brother Tim's church is when the same Miracle happens at our church and vice versa we can be just as happy when the dead are raised up in Africa as we can if it happens in our church if we have the right attitude and we can say praise God and we can glorify God just as much whether it happens to our pastor or somebody else's pastor because what we want is the glory of God help us that we'll never get that way Lord help us we'll never get to a spot that all we testify and testify and testify of what God does in our church and then we hear what God is doing another church of well yeah that's good that's really nice I really appreciate it shame on us Lord if you're doing it you deserve the glory no matter where it happens Lord I'm happy about you here here and about you healing somebody in the Pentecostal church I'll be happy this morning Lord if you heal somebody in the Baptist Church because that mortal got healed in the glory of God was displayed it's not bringing glory to us it's not bringing honor to us it's bringing glory to you Lord Jesus search US father searches mold to shape us oh Hallelujah Hallelujah praise the Lord I'm we don't have room to make an altar call for anybody but if everybody anybody that just want to come up anybody I just sat like that anybody that just want to come up and talk to the Lord you just you just feel the Lord drawing you and you just want to come up you can send them out there at your seat but if you want to take a little trip down here Lord I just I want to have today as a rededication service Lord Hallelujah Lord I don't want to be the one that will be hindering my son my daughter my nephew my aunt my uncle Lord I want to be able to pray the prayer of faith I want to be able to be the one of you link me into your channel father that if my son needs healing that it could be my face you remember the little woman that had the baby she was up on the balcony and there's a sister up there give her a seat she said sister I know I know you've got a prayer card but I just I'm so burdened for your look would you be okay with you if I pray for your little child why sure honey go right ahead you remember whoever the prophet that little baby woman come and brought her baby up in the prayer life and the prophet said your baby he was already healed that sister right back there up in the balcony laid hands on her and got healed her right there can you imagine how the displeased the Lord if that sister would have said while who in the world am I there's brother Branham here who am I God won't hear my prayer God's going to hear Brother Brandon's prayer but for some reason brother God wanted to use that little mother no doubt she had a feeling in her heart as a mother but maybe brother Branham couldn't have had Prophet tells us in one place if she hadn't done it God would have rebuked her but God linked her with that baby's healing God May link you today God May link you where you or somebody else with somebody else's healer remember the prophet said when you lead somebody to the Lord you will be identified with that name throughout eternity and you imagine Brothers all the people that God is used to to be instrumental think about it oh brother Donnie just
