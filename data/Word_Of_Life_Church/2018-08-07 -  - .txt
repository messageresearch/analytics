you do when we thank you Lord but you're mindful of each one bless your word in Jesus name Amen if you are I mean standing in turn your scripture to Galatians 5 the Galatians 5 verses 4 through 7 Paul speaking to the Galatians here Christ has become of no effect unto you whosoever you are justified by the law you are fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth the Lord had the blessings to his word if I could speak to it a little bit tonight on what have hindered you Paul asked the Galatians here who have hindered you as the word has continued down through time through the seven church ages and church age measures the Lord give revelation as the word goes we found out who we found out in this age who hinders us and it's us it's this it's this man so tonight we're going to ask the question what have hindered you just to give a background on the Galatians here the Galatians were a collection of Celtic Gauls that were there your France and there in that time when Alexander went north and they fled down to Asia Minor down around Turkey during that time they were they were considered to be barbarians to the civilized word world at that time they weren't educated so Paul is sent down there by God following the leading of the Lord to go into the Gentiles Paul goes down there brings the word to him and they accept the word they've never heard anything like this before and they accept the word Paul preaches to them adoption by grace he preaches in the cross he preaches that you're saved by the by the blood of Jesus Christ that was their sins and they accept it and they believe it but it just so happened some some of the Jews teachers and Pharisees followed them down there and then but they didn't necessarily go down there and tell them what Paul told you was wrong but what they told him was you have to have this as well you have to have this - so had had they approached it with like Paul was telling him was wrong because they loved Paul they probably wouldn't took it so well so they took it both they they started to believe well you got to be circumcised you got to go by the the you got to have sacrifices you have to go by the commandments so Paul hears tell abyss word comes back to him he's going back to the Ephesians 2 Corinthians different Gentile groups there and it gets word back to him so Paul writes him a letter back and I gotta get to reading the letter the first time I ever read this I thought you know Paul was really mad at them Galatians Paul was mad and then you read it and I got to think another day when I was reading this for the hundredth time that was not Paul's concern Paul was not mad at them we'll get into that just in a few seconds but when Paul goes back down there and then writes to him in the New International Version says I am astonished that you were so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel which is really no gospel at all Paul say in the Old Testament that they're trying to teach you is not the gospel this is not the good news that's the law so Paul begins to tell them he said this is really no gospel evidently some people are throwing you into conversion confusion and trying to pervert the gospel of Christ in in the way the glaciers looked at it they felt like they were this was gonna drag for a minute but we'll get out of it if you won't bear with me the Galatians weren't didn't feel like they were turning away from God they were fervently getting into what Paul had taught them but they also were getting into what these Judaizers were were giving him and they thought they were all one so Paul writes him to straighten him out so the Jews who went down there I suppose they tell them the things that Paul taught you were were good but you have to apply the works you have to you have to have works God looks at works so these people who had done everything with their hands all their life you know they were they were fighters they were athletic people so Paul comes back and tells him you were running so well what happened Paul uses something that they could understand you were running well he didn't say you were serving God well he didn't say you were accepting gospel well he said you were running well but I got to look at the way the Paul approached him who had hindered you is what he asked we're gonna look at that and in Galatians three and one Paul says o foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath evidently set forth and crucified among you so it looks like he's upset at you foolish Galatians but it's not like that like that the way I like to look at Paul it is looking at what happened to these Galatians was Paul your children comes home with a your child comes home with a black eye they get in a fight at school you say who done that to you who has done this to you who hurts you so Paul is not not centering his anger his indignation on the Galatians he wants to know who done this Galatians 5 10 brings that out a little more have confidence in you through the Lord that you will be non otherwise minded he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be so Paul saying whoever caused you to do this judge was going to come upon them so let's look at you did run well who did him to you that you should obey the truth Paul says you run well you did that's the action that the Galatians he put upon the Galatians you did run well and we look at that word its metaphor taken from runners in a race to exert oneself strive hard to spend one strength in performing or attaining something the word occurs in Greek writings denoting to incur extreme peril which requires exertion of all of one's effort to overcome I got to looking at this word I got to in the thing that stood out for me this is the same word that Jesus used when is the word run when he is bringing the parable of the prodigal son when he explains how the father ran to the prodigal son and policies telling them you were running this way you were running with every ear exhorting every effort you have you were you were giving it your all while you were running you weren't falling short you couldn't have gave any more you know and I think sometimes you know as we look at our own spiritual life you know how much are we given how much are we running how much you know we when we look at we're running this race are we giving it all we had all we got or were we giving it to something else are we giving it to other things in our life the greatest race you're running in your life is the thing that's most important to you the thing that you give the most time the thing you run it everybody's got a different race in their life I praise this gospel this is the only race that'll get you across the finish line so and Paul tells him he says you're running in this manner you know I got thinking Lord the way Jesus used that and the prodigal son he's telling him you know this is the way the father ran to you the father into you in such a way that he exerted all his effort God could not have gave any more when he ran to you he exerted all he had are you giving all you have where is our effort you know we we say all the time it's almost over the finish line's right in front of us we say it all the time every day you know that's in our minds we're with and it becomes tradition do we do you really stop and think do you think about what you're running to is there anything in your life that's holding you back from giving it all you got is there anything in your life it that you desire so much that you you can't give it to this if God gave that much his entire self for you he couldn't gave them more he could not a gave when God looked back at what he gave you he couldn't have said I could have gave a little more he could have never said that he will never say that and all he expects from us we call herself the bride we call it we say Jesus lives in us Christ lives in us and in Christ said when you see me you see the father I do with as the father does that comes through the bride as well so looking at that he says you did run well you were giving it all you had you couldn't gave any more but what hindered you the Greek word is hinder means to beat back the devil came down there and tried to beat back beat them off of what Paul was telling them the devil was trying to hinder them from receiving this adoption Paul was preaching about receiving the the blood of Calvary receiving the grace so what hindered him we're not gonna fall for somebody coming in in amongst essence telling us you know what brother Donnie's preaching what brother Darrell's preaching brother Terry's preaching you know witting it ain't true you gonna fall for that you're not gonna fall for that so what hinders you what hinders us not who we already know who hinders us it's this old man are you letting the old man run the race or you letting the real you run the race cuz I'm gonna tell you if the old man is running for you you'll never get to finish line because it's old man ain't going this old man it's not fitting is not going across the finish line so what are we running for is it our job is it our families are we making enough we making enough money just because you said God gave you a job does it mean you give all that time to that job if God gave you a job he's gonna give you the wisdom to divide your time for that job and for him your family your money your husband your wife worldly possessions what are we racing for what means the most what are we trying to gain people want so much stuff so much stuff let me explain to this this is not D Christianizing anybody this is not making nobody non bride but Satan will put everything in your life that is not a sin that is not a sin your job is not a sin your vacations are not a sin your money is not just not a sin Satan will put so many things in our life that's not a sin to turn your turn your head from this race there's no way he's gonna get you to smoke to look at pornography to drink to do drugs he's not gonna get you to do sinful things he's gonna put everything in your life that he can that is not a sin to make you sin so so what what are we running for you run you running by the plans and the rules that God laid out in this race right here they are are you running by these plans these rules God's got no clauses in his word to fit your life he's got no clauses in his word to fit your life any different than anybody else's it's an individual walk but everybody has the same rules so we're in a race Satan's job is to hinder you are we gonna run by God's rules the rules that God laid out the 19:58 brother Brandt preach the mighty conquer he said just remember this it's a good lesson for the Church of the Living God if you don't play the games according to the rules we'll be disqualified at the end you have to keep the rules of the game to win and if the rules of the game in this place a man must be born again to enter to the fellowship of Christ and His Church you might be the greatest denomination on the earth but if you haven't played the rules of the game we'll be disqualified at the end we've come to straight with God we got to come straight with God's rules it is in our rules it's his rules we've got to abide by them we're running the race according to his rules and we have to abide by them and when I was studying this a read this and I hope I don't offend anybody about using sport analogy in this because I got some cokes here actually in 65 will brother Brandon referred to our interaction as the bride one another worth as a football game so so I reckon I came to so God tells Paul we read up I believe it was an axe when Paul says I turn away from you I go to the Gentiles from this time forth well Paul was doing God recruited Paul you read this story how God how God came down come down Jesus came down the road to Damascus so he recruited Paul so Paul I've got a team down here in Asia Minor Gentiles and they need a coach so God required Paul to be his coach and now if I offend anyone I apologize that's not that I'm not doing taking that lightly they need to know how to run they not only do know they need to know how to run they need to know where they're going they need to know what they're running for they need to know what the prize is so we're going to call Paul the first Gentile to coach so Paul goes down there and he tells them wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the scene went through it easy beset us let us run the patience with patience the race that is set before us so he goes down there and he tells him we're running the race we'll get into the prize here in a minute but Paul tells him were running a race how do they know what the rules are how do they know the play of the game how do they know how to do it so Paul begins to write the first playbook yeah he begins writing the book tells him the the plays this is how you do this when Satan brings this against you this is how you count it when when Satan comes against you with with depression with with false doctrine this is what you this is the play to combat that so Paul tells them lay aside everything that is a saying that we apply to our lives every time we hear it so much preaching here lay everything aside that we set you what's what's be setting us what do we have in our life that we sets us to win in a race you have to run to finish in a race you don't necessarily have to run you can walk there's going to be many people finish this race not everybody's getting on the podium there's gonna be many finish you're gonna have some that walk you're gonna have some that run this is a bride that runs so Paul begins to write to pray the playbook and then as they're going on as we talked about earlier they start to look at their own works start taking shortcuts this is the best way to do this this is the best way to do that and what brother Brahim said what it takes to overcome all unbelief so there's an old proverb that's more than a proverb no matter how who is there first you have to play the rules of the game where you'll never win if a runner is running around the track one takes a shortcut cuts through the field and beats the other one thereby half-hour he will be disqualified at the end of the race he's got to play it according to the rules of the game Ruiz is qualified and that's the way we do we have to do the race of life were running now it has to be a played played according to God's qualifications or we lose when we get there whether we're president whether we're the governor or minister or who what church you belong to what denominations the rules of the game has to be kept we must run it fair we must play it by the rules we must preach the word we must do it willingly that's why you see so many people leaving nowadays they can't accept the rules if they go through the playbook they don't see they don't see any play in there that fits them the rules are too hard they tried to take shortcuts that's why you see people go do not nominations now until you they tell you they're as happy as ever they're trying to take the shortcut I'm not counting them people out I would never do that I still pray and believe they've got to bring them back but still they're taking a shortcut many play the game many will finish like this have been only elect few elect will get on the podium when you look at the sports world now they always have all-stars this in sports and basketball and football baseball they all have all-stars some of you know how they get there many don't they have an election there's many on that team there's teams all kinds of teams but to make an all-star to be one of the best you have to be elected you have to get in by election how do they get in Hall of Fame it's an election they get put in the Hall of Fame by election brother Mike Price I was I've been studying this a long time and I was studying this at the time bruh last time by the Mike Price was here when he was preaching about the Hall of Fame and everybody don't go to Hall of Fame everybody don't when you're good enough and you finally you get to go say to the Superbowl where do you go that means you're the best you're the all-stars where do you go you go to the White House you get a banquet see it's not everybody that plays the game gets the big prize so why do we not get any better why do in our life we feel like we're just dredging along we're not we're not running very hard we're you feel like you get up in the morning Lord I can't go on people wonder why their spiritual life is so weak we have practice here three times a week you've got no excuses you've got no excuses I go to practice up on the hill my boy plays if there and I go practice up there and you watch them there's some there that all they care about is getting on the sidelines of a football game and letting the cheerleaders know they're on the team they don't care if they play or not they're just there there's some that get mad because they're not the one running the ball they're not the one playing this position that position we have them here and we got some that just come in and do their job do what they're supposed to do they don't gripe they don't complain they'll sweep the floor they'll dust they'll get somebody a drink of water they don't care they'll do whatever they're asked to do so we have that people you can't understand why you're not getting better when you don't practice you know you sit there mad because you're not singing you're not playing the guitar you're not preaching listen you know if something like that keeps you from praising God I feel sorry for you well brother joel makes me sit down brother louie makes me stand up brother joel makes me raise my hands brother louie makes me clap well the low he says give Jesus Christ a hand clap of praise listen I'm not clapping - brother Louie I'm not raising my hands cuz brother Joel told me - he just reminded me listen if I can sit there if I get upset because I have to raise my hands or give Jesus Christ and Hank type of praise you know what you're telling Christ my disappointment is more worthy than your praise so if we can pray you past that we can use you on the team listen we're gonna make this through we're gonna get through this as a body it's like me and brother Dara was talking earlier it's an individual walk it's an individual race but before you can recognize you are the bride you've got to recognize where you are as an individual it's not a collective memory of no one you're the bride it's each individual no one there the bride thank you for that brother Daryl but you need you got people since I can't do it like I can't you know I come to practice I just I can't do it that's the devil telling you that the greatest example the greatest example I can tell you of somebody persevering through something and self-will I'm gonna many of y'all member Buster Douglas Buster Douglas was a boxer he was getting ready to fight Mike Tyson Mike Tyson was 37 and L never been beat most of his knockouts were in the first round Buster Douglas was a nobody absolutely nobody busters Douglass's mom died two days before the fight before she died she told everybody my baby's gonna beat Mike Tyson yeah he got knocked down in the seventh round if it wasn't for the bail he'd have been knocked out lost fight he come back in the 10th round and not Mike Tyson al human who wheel human will that's all it was God didn't tell him God didn't tell him nothing you're in a fight every day of your life I think of this every time brother Joel Brown gets up and sings the champion of love we're in a fight every day of our life over here we got we got the devil in this corner he that Satan's got his old demons over here sickness cancer diabetes back problems financial problems depression bitterness sin anything you can imagine he's got him in this corner over here and he's yelling at him telling him you're gonna get that son of God right there or I'm sending you back to hell you're gonna go in there you're gonna attack him you're gonna beat him with fear and doubt you're gonna beat him with reasoning and then there's a son of God standing over here getting ready to face it you think God's standing over yelling at him beating him and telling him what he's gonna do if you don't do this if you don't beat this cancer if you don't if you don't beat this this sin I'm gonna send you to hell God would never do that you never do that but there you are you're everybody's battle is different everybody here tonight if you could put yourself in a ring tonight or something that beats you back something that just gets at you and you can't seem to get over that hump and you're in the corner Mike Tyson would be in the corner cus D'Amato would come up on that side of the ring and say things to him he wouldn't yell at him imagine God doing that to you you're getting ready to go into battle what do you think God would say to you he wouldn't be yelling at you he wouldn't be giving you some some doctrine that you don't understand I believe God would come up to you and say you see that devil of cancer up there brother Keith you can beat him anytime anyplace under any condition that's a quote brother branham gay any condition and he he would let you go if Buster Douglas could take self-will from something that a human being told him and do something that the odds on him were 47 to one and he overcame all the odds and you have a God telling you that has never failed not one time has never failed he's never lied and he tells you you can be him you can beat him it's up to us to believe it it's up it's up to us you get your gloves on we'll call them faith and praise and you go in there and you start beating him back God's not gonna put you in a gang he's they'll put you in a ring he's not gonna put you in a race without properly it quick and giving you the proper equipment he's giving you everything that you need the play books being written the play book for this age has been written we wonder you know Satan toes this situation at me where's it at in the word that I can get the play for this Satan comes against you God says I'll drop a play here in Isaiah 59 19 when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against you you get sick God says well let's put a play right here in mark mark 16 18 they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you get depressed God says I got a play for that peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you any need that you have God says I'll drop another one down in john john 15:8 if you abide in me and my words abide in you shall I ask whatever every you will it should be done unto you you say brother Joe he talks to melt on Satan tops me all the time I came here god from Satan it talks to me all the time that's his job you've got to have an opponent you have to have an opponent it's not a competition if there's not an opponent in there it's just it's just a jog there's nothing pushes you harder than an opponent so you say Satan talks to me all the time well God dropped one in there too revelation 18:4 said I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people run my people run this race that's the other voice from heaven so he's not going to he's not going to put you in the race without properly you equipping you it's on football team do you think they're gonna stick a lineman in there to be the quarterback you think they're gonna book cheerleader out there to be the running back they're not properly equipped you got to be properly equipped that's where this comes in this not only has the list for every play that you need this has all the equipment you need so when you get out there and you performing your best you're giving it all how do you think God is reacting how do you think God reacts when you you give it your best sometimes you don't feel like you're giving your best and sometimes the road ramp said you feel like he's not even there you feel like he's not there you slow down you come to a jog you come to a walk do you raise your hand to be taking out the game because god I can't I can't feel the team owner here so I need a break it's in you it's born in you you don't want to come out you feel like it sometimes but you don't want to come out and we need each other your brother's sister your teammate gets weak gets dragged down we're here to lift him up we're here to lift one another up if I make it you're gonna make it if we're all brides you're not making it without me you're not making it without me at all it's teamwork but don't get upset if you're not the one the featured running back if you're not the star runner in the race if you're not the ten to one favorite in the match it takes us working together listen you're here to protect me and I'm here to protect you we need each other I told you I had this I'm gonna read this this in 1962 the influence of another lebreton when you're playing a ball game and it's football season the thing we want to do is not everybody trait try to take the ball away from the man that's got it we're trying to make he's trying to guard that man protect him let him get through we're trying to make a goal see but could you imagine a team so untrained as to find one man their own man with the ball running to the field go then instead of trying to knock the enemy away from him the opposing team to let your own man that's got the ball take off with it every man try and take the ball of his hand while you're bound to lose and today we have the same thing we see God come on the scene and going to bless a certain thing let's keep all the enemies from it just because you ain't got the ball don't mean you can't block you have to block the brother Terry's running the ball I'm blocked for him today we have the same thing when you see God come on the scene doing a certain and going to bless a certain thing let's keep all the enemies away from it let's use our influence as tackles not runners tackles that protect the runner lets him pack the ball through because there's no opposition all he has to do is just keep running and we should be tackles you know always gonna get to run the ball well I assure you you're not gonna want to run the ball if it's not your play if your number don't wait called you don't want to run the ball you're out of your place running the ball sometimes will include sickness it will include financial downfall all kinds of things hardships I was studying this and I hope you don't mind sister Alice I got to thinking of sister Alice going through her her kidney disease and all that she went through I got to thinking you know Satan come up with a play called kidney disease I know brother Terry would have run the ball for but God said you can't run it she can why wouldn't brother Terry get to run that ball why wouldn't God let brother Terry brother Terry but had done it in a heartbeat he took it why wouldn't he let brother Terry run the ball sister Alice because she couldn't a block like he could you have to we have to block your ball might be cancer your ball might be bitterness it might be depression who knows what it might be I don't want your ball but I will block with everything I got for you I will give it all I got for you that's when you have a team sometimes the ball might be a blessing you might get jealous instead of getting jealous why don't you block for them with that blessing if we can stop for a minute and look at when Jesus was handed the ball God pulled every blocker off the field and gave him the ball and said run it there was nobody blocking for him everything that you had every sin that you could even thought of was placed on him that was his ball that's what he run with who blocked for him you couldn't his own father didn't blocked for him and he took it into the face of the enemy Satan put everything he had on the field but because he did that you don't have to because he was willing to do that one particular play he made a way for you to do all the others whether Bram said and this was in 65 door to the door now if you try to take the ball away from your own man you're just messing up your team guard your man see keep guarding him keep the rest of them so he can make the run we'll have the touchdown after awhile and Jesus will come and then I'll be over brother Branham says the Lord bless you what a way to end the service talking about football don't get upset because you're not running the ball you're still running you're still in the race you're still in the game with my oldest played football yeah we owe a bunch of lime and the people after the game you hear you know em lawmen they don't ever get no credit for nothing all the stars go to the runningback the receivers the quarterback the linebackers they did all the work they didn't want that that was their job they were finding their place if every single one of us could find our place in the playbook with work we're worrying about how you're playing the ball how you're running the ball how you're doing your play if you're taking my spot you're taking her spot find your own spot because the person a team has got individuals on that don't know their spot don't know they're a team they figured it out as we're running this Brides running yeah she's giving it all she's got one thing different about this bride she's not getting weaker she's not getting weaker she's not running out of wind she's giving it all she's got this Brides strongest moment would be when she steps across the line she'll never be any stronger than she will be at that time when she crosses the finish line that will be her strongest moment so she's not getting weaker but we got to do it together we got to finish strong together you see a brother or sister that's on your team this seems like they can't figure their spot out they're trying they're trying to figure it out pick them up pray for them block form when I was a freshman in high school I run cross-country we didn't have a lot of people on the team as a freshman ran with the varsity I wasn't any good I just ran but I was 14 years old we had a senior olan team was like top ten in the stage name was Billy Parker Billy could run so I get out there I start running Billy says you stay with me get my pace he slowed his pace down so I could keep up it amazes me the things that little thing to stick with you I begin to lag back because even when Billy slowed his speed down I couldn't keep up with him Billy said grab my jersey he was a senior he was popular you know he said yo grab my jersey he literally try to pull me around I got to thinking about that do we offer that kind of help one to another sure you know if people have that earthly love friendship I'll put it this way Viking explained at rest sometimes I get in service the service is really good I see people worship and everybody does it don't make you not a Christian make you not have the Holy Ghost but something it's just like a battle to get through sometimes into worship yeah and there's certain people that I see worship I don't care to tell you now I won't embarrass him he's my buddy Greg Robbins when I seen brother Greg worship I read children I grabbed his jersey [Applause] I've done it with brother Terry sister Tessa violet I see somebody the whole East Coast and they get that second wind Billy would get a second wind and he would leave me he needs to Joe grab my Jersey you know that's teamwork you know I hope you don't run but Terry brother Greggy I'm gonna reach over spiritually and I'm gonna grab that Jersey and I'm gonna let you pull me in that's what we do that's what we do we're here for each other we don't win the race that's a bride till all of us are across the line when we run across chemistry you know the team was not considered finished unless till the last Runner was in and that was it I don't care if you were last your team wasn't done until you came in we've been in a relay race you can look at that at this way we've been in a relay race for over 2,000 years Paul Tate takes the baton and takes off he takes it and he runs and he runs and he runs in that first Church age and as he runs he hands it off Tyrannosaur Iranians runs runs and runs and then to Martin Columba so on you ever watched a relay race when a runner runner has the baton and the runners taken off you got another runner in front of him that he at a certain line in the track that's waiting for that baton that second runner does not stand there in wait he does not stand there and wait for that baton he takes out running and that previous church age runs right into that next church Shh that when brother branham took off running the seventh church age I'm jumping ahead here a minute he didn't start out with a baton he was Baptist he didn't have this word yet he didn't have this word but he was running with his hand back he knew something was coming you got to keep the hand back brother branham's it was talking about it in the Philadelphia Church if you want to go read it I don't have a quote wrote some notes down he said there was an overlapping a melting or fading into rather than an abrupt end or a clear start so the runner has to run into the next stage has to hand off the playbook from age to age to age the playbook gets more explained more explained as it's being handed off look at Martin Luther he was Catholic he didn't start off with this he had two runaways before it was poor he ever had justification figured out John Wesley had to run a while before he ever the baton of sanctification was ever handed to him so if they had to run the race we've got to run the race but as we look at the way that relays race was was sanctification our justification came up to justification didn't stop it didn't stop at the six church age line you have to have it too it had to carry on with it justification had to carry on through with the baptism of the Holy Spirit it had to continue with it to the seventh age but now that the seventh age has the baton what's that last runner called the last runner it's called the anchor it's the anchor the anchors the one that crosses the finish line with the word every single word every dot everything that was carried from Paul to our anus to Martin to Columba Island down to every Church ages this bride will cost the finish line with it so Paul jumped back to Paula minute so Paula as he's speaking to the Gentiles he's telling we're gonna run a race he explains to him what the word to he has to tell him about a prize he got you know telling me running for nothing when you start out the season say yeah a football game you're playing for the Lombardi Trophy you know it's there at the end you've got to get it baseball you playing for the pennant you know what's there you know you don't go in blindly when you enter a race you those that run you know what's at stake so Paul was telling there's a prize Corinthians in 1st Corinthians 9 he says know ye not that they which run in a race one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things excuse me and now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an dunker uncorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself would be a castaway so he says run run for the prize one that you may obtain this word obtain means to lay hold up as one to make one's own to seize upon take possession of of Christ by his holy power and influence laying hold of the human mind and wheel in order to prompt and govern it Christ basically putting your mind on cruise control your spirit has control of your mind the Spirit of Christ you're focused on one thing and that's the prize nothing else matters that's what your mind is set on Paul says run that you may obtain run that you have made don't think of nothing else don't think of the runner besides you don't think of anything that would be said to you keep your mind on the prize and keep running so Paul tells him in the Philippians I press toward the mark of the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus this word press is to run swiftly in order to catch a person or thing to run after to press on figure T of one who runs a race race runs swiftly to reach the goal in a hostile manner to pursue in a hostile manner basically similar to what we said the word run was to exert all your energy to exert everything that you got Paul saying you pressed towards the I press towards the mark in a hostile manner because nothing else matters nothing else matters in sports they call the running backs that run like that I call him running angry Paul says I'm running angry nothing's gonna stand between me and the prize if Satan gets in front of me I'm running him over that's the mindset we have to have as the bride the prizes before us if God could could open our eyes spiritually and show us how close it was show us how close we are to the end he wants you to see it through the word but if he was to open your mind and let you see it it surprised you I believe it surprise you how close were to the end I'm not stolen now for nobody if you want to walk you can walk if you want to sit take a drink whatever when I can work across country many times I was the last one of my team but I never walked I never walked I couldn't run fast but I had stamina and I could I could run I would pass people that walked I would beat many people that walked I remember i was telling somewhere not too long ago in the state of Kentucky before I ran him over at ball county over Danville they had a state invitation States from teams from all over state I placed 157th proud of that there's about 500 people in the race so I honey can do that back but I think I was last on my team but my team finished we finished the race we didn't walk we're gonna try we ran we finished the race so Paul says are pressed towards the mark the mark the distant mark looked at the goal or in one has in view to me the key word there in view it's not out of view it's in view we've laid our spiritual eyes upon the goal we can see it Bob Ram says in exposition of the seven churches chapter for a crown given to the winner of the Olympic race was a garland of olive branches but the crown spoken of here in Revelation given to a martyr is the crown of royalty Jesus calls it the crown of life the one crown is for those who have striven those are others for those who have given both crowns are incorruptible they will not perish the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the plaudits of the world their glory will fail but those who give their lives for God either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the crown of life that's your prize you know the world am I not sound like much there's nothing in the world I want more nothing and I'm gonna run till I get it the thing that I like about Paul was Paul was not telling Paul was a leader by example he was not telling the Gentiles this is what you do this isn't how you need to run this is what you need to do he wasn't telling them that by not knowing how to run the race Paul ran it Paul fought the fight fought the fight he got in the ring he carried the ball Paul knew how to do it in second Timothy 4:7 Paul says I fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them that love his appearing this word course from here I don't mean to keep throwing word definition to you I apologize but the word course that is given here it's alternate to the word run that we looked at earlier what Jesus used in the prodigal son Paul says I have finished my course saying I have finished running with all I had I have finished giving my all theirs I have nothing left to give because I've gave it all and through it all I've kept the faith I ran hostile I run out of extreme peril I ran exerting all I had to overcome I have finished that and I still kept the faith see Paul had faith that he would reach he would reach the prize the same spirit that led Paul through that age down through every age is the same spirit leading through this age we see people that are being influenced now to change the playbook as we would call it a do it take it away get it to fit their life and get it to fit the race they're running get to fit the game they're running but we're in a race we're a spiritual race we got to finish quickly but Bram said what it takes to overcome there's an old proverb that's more than a proverb no matter who who is there first you have to play the rules of the game or you'll never win if a runner is running around the track the one takes a shortcut cuts through the field and beats the other one thereby half hour still he will be disqualified at the end of the race he's got to play it according to the rules of the game or he's disqualified why would why would we why would anybody no one what the rules of the game no one that God put the rules there why would we try to alter that why would we try to change that it's man-made it's not gonna work it's been the gods have been that way all through every church age it's the same rules for everybody he didn't change him with these church age he didn't change him at all Paul's brother Bream said that's the way we have to do the race of life that we're running now has to be played according to God's qualifications or we lose when we get there I believe we read that earlier must have headed here twice Paul said I believe in Hebrews the twelfth chapter that seeing we are compassed about such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and seeing that doesn't beset us that we may run the patience the race is set before us Paul was speaking in the Olympics and so forth and that was in Greece in Rome so forth he knows you had to play that game fair if he didn't you'd be disqualified and tonight as born-again Christians as believers here at the end time we've got to play the game according to the rules we've got to run the patience the race that sit before us looking to the author and finisher Jesus Christ and everybody's gonna run with me stand let's hurry I know about you but well I do know about you but I'm not walking I'm not walking I've done made up my mind well I might get hindered I promise you I might get hindered but you're living in a time and age and people don't want to run this race no more they've lost a view of what's at the finish line they've lost to desire they lost lost the concept of team it's a body move it's a body move each individual finding their place on the team when everybody does what they're supposed to on a football team when everybody does their assigned positions you got winners you have winners I remember enough telling you I run across country is a freshman and I wasn't the fastest but growing up in the messenger's there's things that you stand out to you and when my friends you know we hear we hear all the time you know brother branham said that somebody would be there to greet you so there's those on the sidelines cheering you on those that have crossed the finish line cheering you on you know we had a coach coach garnet Parker coach garnet coach Parker would get there early many times and possibly go over the track he would go before you and you know and he he could let you know if when you come out of the woods it's gonna go to the trails going to the right stay low don't get up on the high side it's rocky up there different things and I got things about that you know the seventh age coach that we had in this age she's done the same thing I was reading the other day I was reading the other day when he was saying he had that vision of the bride he was screaming out to her stay in line he was fulfilling his position as a coach I don't know if he looked at it that way this is just an allergy so it's not a type I'm not typing one thing that stood out to me when I ran many times meteor one other guys their freshman we beat last but my friends that had gone across over did come inside maybe two or three hundred yards away and industries when it comes your last stretch would be straight and they start yelling at you run don't let that guy behind you catch he's gaining on you run give it all you got you would look down and the in line you could see coach Parker up there screaming at you Jove you better run and you ran coach Parker told you to run you ran I don't care how bad you were you ran but in thinking of that do you realize how many people that have crossed over tonight just tonight in this service are cheering you on or screaming out to you don't stop don't stop stay on the low side don't go too far on the high side we've been that way before we know where it leads they're encouraging you a great cloud of witnesses and you got a profit on the other side of the finish line it's standing there watching you his voice is still screaming out [Music] I was telling brother Daryl before services I talked to Gary Longoria today sister marge was she was like a mom to me I lived in there for a while and I'd come over and eat hang out with Gary and we weren't in church would have time I was down here I went to church of christ cuz had chili suppers but we'd go over there and eat and she'd feed us she said you going to service this weekend we'd make up something I never told him they didn't have chili so wasn't coming but but she let us know it's where we needed to be yeah and I got to see her the other day and there was Darrell says first time she's ever told me she loved me not that she didn't I knew she did but he was telling me he said shortly before she passed he said Deanna came out the room told brother Homer says she's in there talking to Danny Williams I don't know if any of y'all Monroe Danny Williams wonderful met minister he's passed on many years ago from Louisiana says she's a him a brother Homer were like best buddies when you go to they have services when you seen one you seen the other they were always together says she's in there talking to Danny Williams said it scared the girls it just made him really nervous and the home brother Houma went in there I said she looked at brother home where she sitting Homer she said that Danny Williams he's still a jokester said he was if he knew brother Danny there was never a serious bone in his body even when he was preaching sometimes he was always cutting out of it you know I thought you know what I think somebody had told me that but the hombre told her a day or two ahead times she was nervous about crossing but the Homer said don't worry the Prophet says you know somebody would come down there but you knew to make it easy for you and if anybody could brother Danny could so she had somebody to meet her at the finish line so I encourage you tonight don't quit running if we could see we'll wrap if we could come together as a body as a bride listen the bridegroom will not take a bride but has jealousy envy anger hatred it takes perfect love that's all that's there that's all brother brems said it's always there was perfect love so in order for you to cross that line the only thing you'll take across that line is perfect love so don't quit running whatever you do if you got loved ones it's lost it's not saved encourage them it's about over our heads Heavenly Father what I love you with all my heart there's no one part of me that don't love you Lord Lord I look at my life sometimes I see things that beset me all along the way I see stumbles that I have or but not one time has ever quenched my desire to run got one time I love running I love it heart sure I get tired I get weary but Lord hear the author and finisher of our faith Lord and a finisher part is the part I love the most that means you will complete that what you've started course we look at the bride around the world Lord we see things have been father we've seen miracles we see you moving ways nor did people can't explain Lord there's great works but Lord that's not what's gonna take us across the finish line Lord when the miracles or started to stop her in the prophets ministry Lord and he turn to the word many people fell away those miracles weren't gonna carry him over the finish line it's the word Lord it's the playbook Lord if we go by every word if we find our place in every position Lord we're gonna make it across lord I pray that you would help every person here Lord Lord if they don't have a desire to run Lord I pray you put it there if they don't have a desire to help someone else Lord I pray you put it there father there's just not a single person here Lord that I don't need and there's not a single person here that don't need me father Lord I pray to you blessing Lord to me these are the greatest people on the face of the earth or since your honor father to come up here and speak to them

I just really enjoyed the servicemen did you enjoy what the Lord had for today [Applause] you know I was thinking I also ran cross-country not in high school I ran ran it in the army I remember one race just praying close but I used to I would always try to hold back when the gun went off I've trained at a certain pace but I would never run that pace at the start of the race I would run a different pace and I would always hold back and is about the 3.2 mark that I would start I would start kicking and that's when I would kick into the pace that I trained and and I did that because when the gun went off a lot of people took off like you know they had ten yards to run and he just went but then they would start falling back but it always gave me built my confidence when I started catching up with the ones that was way out in front of me and I would actually start passing them in and I learned that when you hit the top of the hill it's just human nature to kind of relax a little bit and so I would always use that moment to kick harder and and and and to come down the hill and not in a relaxed but in a hostile fashion which I didn't under and stand at it until tonight but that's what I did I would run like that and and I remember it was right after this certain race and it was about the five mile mark of the race I run the 10k 6.2 miles and I come down off of the hill and of course we were running in Fort Bragg and we hit in the bottom of this hill was heavy sand and I remember this particular race I I come out off the hill and I five miles I was I was tired and blood brother Joe said you just start giving everything you've got when you start kicking you just start kicking and I remember coming down into that sand and hitting it and all my lungs were on fire and my legs were on fire and it I couldn't anybody's ever ran in saying you know it's just so hard to get you legs and and I didn't even notice him when I first came down off of the hill but one of my teammates wilkerson had pulled a hamstring and lot brother Joe said your team has to finish the race so he was heading the finish line with a pulled hamstring and when I hit the sand all of a sudden I heard this voice they begin to say run Ward run you can make it you can do it I was with an airborne unit he started hauling airborne airborne you can do it Ward you can do it forward and when I've climbed the hill I could still hear him when I crossed over the other hill he was still yelling with everything with it run Ward finish the course that day I finished 12th out of 850 some runners I finished 12th that day because somebody encouraged me you know I may not be able to preach like brother Terry or brother Joe or some of these other brothers that you may not be able to do something somebody else can do but there's one thing we can all do we can encourage one another we can lift one another up we can be each other's friend a man we can make sure as brother joe said we can grab ahold of each other's jersey and make sure we take our brother across the line because there's one goal we all want to do I just want to go to daddy's house I just want to set it as table you get tired I just want to go sit down and be home there's something about being home thank you brother Jill we certainly enjoyed it tonight they've encouraged you to keep running don't worry if you can't run as fast as brother Donny we're all going to cross the line just get across the line a man may the Lord Richard bless you were leaving in the morning for Wisconsin we got some meetings
