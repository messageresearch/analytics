[35:33] wonderful awesome services this
[35:40] week oh come on we can do better than
[35:42] that I
[35:49] believe praise the Lord I just saw our
[35:53] brothers just did all three of them an
[35:55] outstanding job didn't you
[35:59] I Marvel at God's variety and how that
[36:02] God calls men and Gifts them different
[36:05] and they study different their approach
[36:08] is different and I just so appreciate
[36:12] men of God that's able to get themselves
[36:14] out of the way follow the leading of the
[36:16] Holy Ghost and see what the Lord will do
[36:19] each sermon was different every
[36:21] ministration but all was different and
[36:24] thought brother Daryl's is just perfect
[36:25] for having a prayer line you imagine
[36:28] Brother David I told Brother Daryl you
[36:30] imagine a brother David's sermon would
[36:31] have been preached on Saturday night you
[36:35] all were sitting her like me you're
[36:36] trying to figure out where in the world
[36:38] is he going on all this leprosy
[36:40] stuff and I thought if he don't get out
[36:42] of that putrification for long I'm going
[36:44] to be sick on a
[36:47] dog type of sermon you have to think
[36:49] about and contemplate you know what I'm
[36:51] saying Yet brother Daryl was just laying
[36:54] it right out there healing Deliverance
[36:56] what we have need of I don't how many
[36:58] things I've already heard backsliders
[36:59] come back to God people got healed
[37:02] people got delivered wonderful things
[37:04] absolutely wonderful things you know you
[37:08] can get some men of God that aren't in
[37:10] competition they're just there to obey
[37:12] the Lord and just be what God wants them
[37:14] to be and follow the leading of the Lord
[37:17] that's when we can have a meeting I'm
[37:19] just so grateful in my heart I know I've
[37:22] said it to you a lot since we've been in
[37:24] our new place here but I'm just so
[37:26] grateful that the Lord
[37:28] has let us have have a place where we
[37:30] can be able to host meetings like this I
[37:33] told you before we've been robbed for
[37:35] not being able to have them surely you
[37:37] understand what I'm saying you probably
[37:39] most of you already knew it anyway but
[37:41] it's such a blessing to be able to have
[37:43] meetings like this we're just so
[37:46] honored so tonight you're stuck with me
[37:49] again Revelation
[37:53] 5:7 we'll we'll read together down to
[37:56] verses 10
[37:58] in praise the Lord I I wish to say again
[38:02] how grateful I am for all of those that
[38:05] was parking the cars and brothers I felt
[38:07] so sorry for them sitting out there
[38:09] sweating and driving vehicles and all
[38:12] that that was going on all the sisters
[38:13] all the work that they did and preparing
[38:16] the food my goodness I got hundreds and
[38:19] hundreds of portions worth of beans and
[38:22] you know this and that and the other to
[38:23] do all that don't you appreciate all of
[38:25] that that work all the Bacon
[38:34] Brothers there's so many parts that it
[38:36] takes to make it be able to flow
[38:38] together and I I don't want to leave
[38:40] anybody out I just want you to know for
[38:42] anything and everything that you did
[38:44] during that time may the Lord bless you
[38:47] whenever the great rewards are given out
[38:48] that day it won't just be um brother
[38:51] Matt and Brother David and and brother
[38:54] Daryl that'll be getting rewards for
[38:56] those of you that pray those of you that
[38:58] did what you did to be able to
[39:00] contribute your little part to that if
[39:02] there's one soul that will be saved one
[39:05] person that was healed and I already
[39:06] know there's several that's already
[39:08] healed a couple of backsliders that I
[39:10] know of that come back to God you were
[39:13] part of that you were part of that work
[39:15] so don't you never let the devil try to
[39:18] convince you that you're not doing
[39:20] nothing for the kingdom of God that is a
[39:23] lie amen praise the Lord
[39:27] now let's read about what made it all
[39:30] possible what we saw this this
[39:34] weekend um after the service on Sunday
[39:38] the ministers myself was back in the
[39:39] office talking about brother David's uh
[39:43] s subject matter and thought and um I've
[39:47] heard brother R say that my goodness
[39:49] thousands of times since I've been in
[39:50] the message about the
[39:52] bleach but I just never really looked at
[39:55] the word bleach wasn't that awesome
[39:58] but one of the brothers I don't remember
[39:59] brother Matt might have been brother
[40:01] Daryl but talking about that God allowed
[40:05] bleach to be created in our
[40:09] day now they believed in forgiveness of
[40:12] sins of course in the days of Luth days
[40:13] of West days of Pentecost but we're not
[40:16] just forgiven we're
[40:18] Justified as if though we never did it
[40:22] in the first place what I found was
[40:24] amazing was when brother brand brother
[40:26] Brandon would speak about it and some of
[40:28] the words that he mentioned about bleach
[40:30] and talked about the molecule and the
[40:32] color and all that and when Brother
[40:34] David brought the scientific meaning of
[40:37] that it paralleled beautifully with what
[40:41] brother brandham said is not awesome I
[40:43] love it when God ties it together that
[40:47] way Revelation
[40:50] 5:7 and he came and took the book out of
[40:54] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[40:56] throne
[40:58] and when he had taken the book The Four
[41:00] beasts and 4 and20 Elders fell down
[41:03] before the lamb having every one of them
[41:06] Harps and golden vials full of
[41:10] odors which are the prayers of the
[41:14] Saints and they sung a new song saying
[41:19] thou not the Saints now not the elders
[41:22] are worthy not the preachers are worthy
[41:26] but thou Art Worthy to take the book and
[41:30] to open the seals thereof for thou was
[41:35] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[41:40] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[41:44] and people and
[41:46] nation and has made us unto our God
[41:50] Kings and
[41:52] Priests
[41:53] Hallelujah and we shall reign on the
[41:57] Earth
[41:58] Earth how many has a request you'd like
[42:00] to make known to the Lord tonight just
[42:02] by raising your hand all right let's
[42:04] let's take it to him now in
[42:06] prayer father just standing here Lord
[42:11] thanking you and giving you praise for
[42:14] the awesome meeting that we had this
[42:16] weekend Lord all three of them together
[42:18] just so
[42:19] wonderful but yet here we stand
[42:23] tonight Lord no doubt every one of us
[42:26] could relate to it in the the natural
[42:27] sense that the very best meal that we've
[42:30] ever had whatever that we would identify
[42:33] that as being maybe a special restaurant
[42:36] that we were able to go to and we
[42:39] ordered our special whatever it was and
[42:41] it was just so
[42:43] outstanding and no matter how good it
[42:45] was everything might have been prepared
[42:48] just exactly the way we like it but
[42:51] what's amazing is after we would get
[42:53] done with that meal within a matter of
[42:56] hours
[42:58] we will find oursel hungry again now it
[43:02] doesn't mean that we'll be able to go
[43:03] back to our F favorite restaurant and
[43:06] get our favorite meal every day but it's
[43:11] kind of special to us so we like to go
[43:14] there maybe on special occasions that's
[43:18] why we have special
[43:19] meetings other people that our church
[43:22] come and different Believers are
[43:24] represented different ministers and we
[43:27] we were so blessed but here we are again
[43:30] on Wednesday night and I find myself
[43:34] hungry
[43:35] again I find myself hungry to be in your
[43:40] presence once
[43:42] more Lord I was so blessed just hearing
[43:45] the brothers Minister and watching the
[43:47] Saints be blessed and just being under
[43:49] your anointing and yet here I am tonight
[43:54] I want more maybe we prayed for hundreds
[43:58] and hundreds of people here Saturday
[44:01] night no doubt there's people here
[44:03] tonight that have needs and they might
[44:06] need to be prayed for
[44:08] tonight so no matter how good that we're
[44:12] fed and how wonderful and awesome your
[44:15] presence is on Sunday morning it's like
[44:18] we can never get enough oh Jesus we're
[44:23] here tonight for
[44:24] more and there's one thing we know about
[44:27] you for sure you certainly have more to
[44:30] give us your Prophet had the people
[44:33] multiple times he would ask them how
[44:35] many needs more of God and hundreds of
[44:38] people would raise their hand and he'd
[44:40] answer with a simple response that than
[44:42] say that shows there's more for you so
[44:46] you saw the needs that were signified by
[44:48] the uplifting of the hands and we're
[44:50] praying tonight that you would just take
[44:52] your word and speak to us once again
[44:55] father our needs are are made known to
[44:58] you of course but your word tells us
[45:01] that we're to make them known to you
[45:03] again so we bring them before you we're
[45:05] asking that you'd help us father would
[45:08] you heal the sick would you deliver the
[45:10] bound would you fill those that don't
[45:12] have the Holy Ghost tonight father
[45:13] whatever we have need of we just bring
[45:16] our needs and our requests to you
[45:18] tonight anoint me Father anoint the
[45:20] people may you move here among us we ask
[45:23] in the name of the Lord Jesus and the
[45:26] saints of God God
[45:28] said amen God bless you praise the Lord
[45:33] so Saints I ask you as you take your
[45:35] seats tonight where would we
[45:39] be in this end time of God had not given
[45:44] us of such an abundance of his Mercy to
[45:49] open his word in such a way that our
[45:54] hearts our minds Our Lives would be so
[45:59] illuminated by a light that has never
[46:03] been on the earth before this age now we
[46:07] know it's nothing to do with us it's not
[46:10] that we're any better than any other age
[46:12] it's not that the preachers in this age
[46:15] are any better there's been great men of
[46:18] God that have stood on the earth and
[46:21] preached under Dynamic I'm talking about
[46:25] Dynamic uh anointings but yet God chose
[46:29] us for this last day I count it a great
[46:33] honor and yet we know that it's because
[46:37] of his Mercy that he's allowed us to be
[46:40] able to stand in this end time and
[46:43] preach and believe under the end time
[46:47] anointing now we believe that we are
[46:49] truly redeemed those of us here tonight
[46:52] that have the token and we know with the
[46:55] token comes an Assurance so the token is
[46:59] the spirit
[47:01] identification that the chemistry of the
[47:03] blood has been applied to your life now
[47:06] remember the prophet taught us that it
[47:09] was thought to be the blood and those
[47:13] other ages it was thought to be the
[47:16] chemistry of the blood I realize there's
[47:19] preachers that still preach it today
[47:21] that is the chemistry but we are living
[47:24] in the age of the person personal life
[47:28] of Christ so it's not just the
[47:31] identification with the chemistry of the
[47:33] Blood Brother David expressed it so
[47:36] beautifully that it was not being
[47:38] covered by the blood our sins simply
[47:41] being painted over but our sins are
[47:45] annihilated they are totally out of the
[47:49] mind of God they don't even exist and
[47:52] then a person that would be in that kind
[47:55] of a state and and we would say but
[47:58] brother Donnie how how can that be that
[48:01] our sins are so forgiven that God
[48:04] doesn't even remember them at all
[48:07] anymore is that what we believe our sins
[48:11] are so far from us that God does not
[48:14] even remember them at all now we do of
[48:16] course but he doesn't and that's what
[48:18] matters and yet we can still get sick we
[48:22] can get weary we can be sad we can be a
[48:26] depressed we can deal with all kinds of
[48:29] anxieties and troubles in our life and
[48:32] you say how can a person that in their
[48:35] soul could stand there before God and
[48:38] God could look at them and not see one
[48:41] fault now listen to me if you are in
[48:44] Christ Jesus tonight you are as perfect
[48:48] in your soul as he is perfect in your
[48:52] flesh you're human you have mistakes and
[48:55] you always will but in your soul you are
[48:59] so Redeemed by the power of that
[49:02] cleansing blood that God no longer looks
[49:06] at you as being a sinner but he looks at
[49:10] you as being a son and daughter of God
[49:13] and sends back not only the blood as a
[49:17] chemistry to paint over the top of your
[49:20] sins but sends the personal life of the
[49:24] Lamb of God himself to to live in each
[49:28] of our redeemed Souls but yet how is it
[49:32] then that we could still have all of
[49:34] these other things that we do is anybody
[49:37] felt kind of sad since Sunday anybody
[49:40] been sick since Sunday anybody had any
[49:43] trouble since Sunday any anxiety since
[49:46] Sunday well of course because we're
[49:49] human beings and we think well how can
[49:53] we be redeemed well it's because of the
[49:57] cycle where we are in this stage of
[50:01] redemption now our souls are fully
[50:04] redeemed and then the display of the
[50:07] token life so when we pray now when I
[50:10] just prayed and when you join with me in
[50:14] prayer it was us making our petition
[50:18] known and us bringing from the sincerity
[50:22] of our hearts but our prayers were
[50:25] coming up through the blood of the Lord
[50:28] Jesus and you might have heard me but
[50:32] father heard Jesus Christ I might have
[50:36] heard you your wife might have heard you
[50:38] your husband might have heard you but
[50:41] when it comes up through the blood as
[50:44] somehow it is changed to where that it
[50:48] is our mediator that is actually
[50:51] bringing our petition to Father God you
[50:54] talking about miraculous
[50:57] and yet we believe that we're in this
[51:00] cycle of redemption to where that the
[51:04] lamb has not yet fully claimed his
[51:07] possession now the Redemption and
[51:10] claiming the redeemed subject is two
[51:13] different things so we know that we will
[51:16] always have troubles in this life we're
[51:19] always going to have problems I hate to
[51:21] be the bearer of bad news but yet we
[51:23] will always deal with this human element
[51:27] every one of us can you imagine brother
[51:30] brandom 3 months after preaching the
[51:33] seals that he stands in Jeffersonville
[51:36] and preaches the message standing in the
[51:39] Gap and talks about forgetting what God
[51:42] called him to do forgetting the burden
[51:45] of his people and God spoke to him and
[51:48] told him that you're like Moses you
[51:51] forgot what I called you for and you
[51:54] become like brother Roberson had in his
[51:57] dream and he tells us one human Frailty
[52:01] after another and he requests the people
[52:05] that they will pray for him that he will
[52:08] regain that love that he's lost in that
[52:12] complex now three months after he's
[52:15] preached the greatest thing that had
[52:17] been preached since Calvary and the
[52:20] raising of the Lord Jesus from the dead
[52:23] which was introducing the the ministry
[52:27] of the son of man now remember he told
[52:31] us as far back as
[52:33] 1958 that there was a difference between
[52:37] the appearing and the coming the
[52:41] appearing and the coming now even in 58
[52:45] he said that for several years he has
[52:49] been appearing Among Us now it's two
[52:53] different words with two different
[52:54] meanings so what happened at the opening
[52:58] of the seals it was a further advancing
[53:01] of that appearing and yet 3 months after
[53:05] that he stands there with a confession
[53:08] that he has built a complex and that the
[53:12] people you know he had such an issue
[53:15] with people and them not loving him and
[53:18] all that sort of thing don't set look at
[53:20] me tonight there probably any person
[53:22] here that ain't got one kind of complex
[53:24] or
[53:25] another and that as human beings will
[53:28] always deal with this part and what
[53:31] we're waiting for is when the lamb will
[53:35] AB absolutely claim what he has redeemed
[53:39] now remember something can be redeemed
[53:43] but the cycle of claiming the Redemption
[53:46] of that is not the same thing as it
[53:49] being redeemed many of you struggle was
[53:53] that in your life and there's something
[53:55] in you that you're constantly longing
[53:58] for more and you're pulling for more and
[54:01] I pray for you time and time again as
[54:04] you will come up front and brother
[54:05] Donnie I want to be closer to God I'm
[54:07] just not sure I'm just not sure well you
[54:10] know for a lot of you it's not that you
[54:12] don't have the Holy Ghost it's not that
[54:15] the token is not already there but what
[54:18] you're crying for in that deep recess of
[54:22] your soul is the Redemption of your body
[54:27] when the lamb will finalize the claim
[54:32] you see he has redeemed us and we're in
[54:35] the work of redemption but he has not
[54:39] made the claim on his inheritance and
[54:44] until he does and he won't until the
[54:48] appointed time we're going to fight
[54:50] battles we're going to have
[54:53] misunderstandings we're going to have
[54:55] misgivings well even have
[54:57] misunderstandings among ourselves we
[54:59] will have misunderstandings maybe with
[55:01] other churches and other believers and
[55:04] yet it's not because we're trying to be
[55:06] different it's just our flesh how that
[55:10] it can Clash one from the other anybody
[55:12] hear me
[55:13] tonight notice this in the breach that
[55:16] he says Christ has redeemed us now we
[55:20] are now redeemed but he has not yet
[55:24] claimed his Poss session yet so here the
[55:28] timeline of Boaz as we've been looking
[55:31] at of the Redemption of rose and Boaz is
[55:35] before the elders at the gate but
[55:37] remember Ruth is not there Ruth was back
[55:41] at Naomi's house and she's waiting for
[55:45] him to claim her because she's uncertain
[55:48] is to going to be her husband or is Boaz
[55:53] going to be her husband she's not
[55:55] certain remember they had no means of
[55:57] communication the way we do today so
[56:00] it's not like as soon as it was done she
[56:02] got a text or a WhatsApp and and a phone
[56:05] call and okay okay everything's good she
[56:07] didn't know until Boaz himself or a
[56:12] messenger came with the message not only
[56:16] the message of redemption but the
[56:18] message of possession you see it's the
[56:21] same way with healing or with a
[56:24] Deliverance that you may need in your
[56:25] life the Lord Jesus has already redeemed
[56:28] that for you but it won't do you one bit
[56:31] of good until it is your personal
[56:35] possession and he's already paid the
[56:37] price that we could be healed delivered
[56:39] whatever more but yet until we are be
[56:43] are able to rise to that level to
[56:45] produce the faith needed and claim it as
[56:48] our own possession my it it's like he
[56:51] died in vain so whenever we're able to
[56:54] rise to that now watch so so he says he
[56:57] has not yet claimed his possession now
[57:00] we are his and he's identified himself
[57:03] with us and we're identified with him
[57:06] but he has not taken us as his wife yet
[57:11] in the material sense we are his bride
[57:15] right now but he's not yet claimed us
[57:17] now he said you may differ with that but
[57:19] just hold on a minute and he goes on to
[57:22] say he hasn't claimed it see if he took
[57:25] the book of Redemption everything that
[57:27] Adam had and everything that he lost
[57:30] Christ redeemed back he's already
[57:33] redeemed us but he hasn't took the
[57:36] possession yet so how can I how can you
[57:40] with a down payment of eternal life
[57:43] already in our soul Carol and I was
[57:46] talking to list on the phone yesterday
[57:48] and was talking about different people
[57:49] that had got healed and I I was talking
[57:51] to them and I told them I said you know
[57:53] every time that the Lord performs the
[57:55] divine healing or a miracle that is
[57:59] actually a deposit or a little bit of
[58:03] the body chain so a person walks up and
[58:06] they're sick and they're Afflicted
[58:08] prayer is offered the power of God comes
[58:11] down the spirit of God moves inside that
[58:14] person's body and Alters that sickness
[58:17] changes that pain changes whatever it is
[58:20] are going through you understand what
[58:22] that is that's a little reflection of
[58:25] what we're fixing to get in the body
[58:27] change so every time you see a person
[58:31] that is being healed or a miracle is
[58:33] perform it's a little bit of a down
[58:37] payment of what we're fixing to get in
[58:39] the Rapture so how could we get that and
[58:43] not hunger for so much more the closer I
[58:46] get to him I it's so strange because
[58:50] you'd think the well you you RVE to a
[58:52] certain spot and then you would you
[58:54] would get this great s satisfaction and
[58:57] you wouldn't actually want any more no
[58:59] friends I've been serving him and and
[59:02] well next week I guess it'll be Carol
[59:04] and I will be 68 years old I've been
[59:06] serving him since I was 12 46 years 56
[59:12] years of my life serving the lord and
[59:16] yet getting closer and closer and
[59:18] finding out more and more and knowing
[59:21] more and more about him and yet I want
[59:24] more now than I did when I first got
[59:27] saved anybody feel that same way now
[59:30] there's some people in you have been
[59:32] saved longer than I have and yet my we
[59:34] just talking about the great services
[59:36] that we had but I hope you come back
[59:38] tonight expecting more and wanting more
[59:42] I'm talking about a a fountain that God
[59:45] has allowed us to break into that the
[59:48] closer we get the more that we want and
[59:51] the more we understand the more I want
[59:54] and whenever I hear preachers preach
[59:56] like I did this weekend I just heard
[59:59] some of those tapes that those Brothers
[1:00:02] quoted from I just went through the
[1:00:04] Harvest Time just not over a few weeks
[1:00:06] ago and listened to it about three times
[1:00:10] in a row listened to it again and again
[1:00:14] and again and yet some of the quotes
[1:00:16] they was reading was right out of
[1:00:19] harvest time and I said D where were you
[1:00:22] Donnie but do you understand what we
[1:00:25] broke into we have broke into
[1:00:28] eternity so it's not like that we will
[1:00:32] on this Earth that will ever arrive to
[1:00:35] this we call it the satisfying portion
[1:00:38] and it is it is a portion that is
[1:00:42] satisfies you that you'll never want no
[1:00:44] more of the world but it does not mean
[1:00:47] you want don't want no more of it it's
[1:00:51] like you become hope you understand when
[1:00:53] I said this way you become a addicted to
[1:00:57] it how manyan he understands that no
[1:00:59] don't look at me fun now Paul talks
[1:01:01] about in the New Testament about some
[1:01:03] saints of God that had addicted
[1:01:05] themselves to serving the lord so what a
[1:01:08] great thing to be addicted to in serving
[1:01:11] the lord and serving God's people so
[1:01:14] it's not like you you think my this is
[1:01:16] torment because the more I get the more
[1:01:19] I want no actually you're better off to
[1:01:22] feel that way than the people who go to
[1:01:24] church one time and they think they get
[1:01:27] everything they need so why do I even
[1:01:29] need to go back anymore I mean I go once
[1:01:31] a month whether I need it or not and I
[1:01:34] might go twice a month you know but
[1:01:36] aren't you glad there's something inside
[1:01:38] of you that the more you get the more
[1:01:40] you want how many of y'all been serving
[1:01:42] God for 10 years 20 years 30 years 40
[1:01:48] years 50 years 60 years look 50 60 years
[1:01:54] well those of you y'all still want more
[1:01:56] of God yeah you don't want no more of
[1:01:58] God you want more do you well that's
[1:02:00] good you see what I'm talking about so
[1:02:02] there's something in us what is it it's
[1:02:04] that down payment of this cycle of
[1:02:07] redemption and what are we waiting for
[1:02:09] why wouldn't we wait my every day we
[1:02:12] live in this world it's more hell on
[1:02:15] this Earth and before long our lord
[1:02:18] Jesus is going to say this place is no
[1:02:21] longer fit for my bride to live in
[1:02:23] that's the day I'm waiting for but until
[1:02:26] that day arrives I don't want to just
[1:02:28] sit around Twitter in my thumbs I want
[1:02:30] to do something for the kingdom of God
[1:02:32] don't you I want to reach out I want to
[1:02:35] love I want to be a witness I want to do
[1:02:38] everything I can notice again he said he
[1:02:41] hasn't claim to if he took the book of
[1:02:43] redemption everything that Adam had that
[1:02:47] he lost Christ redeems back he's already
[1:02:50] redeemed us but he hasn't took the
[1:02:53] possession yet he cannot on until the
[1:02:57] time appointed now what is that the time
[1:03:00] appointed well say well it's probably me
[1:03:02] it's probably me no it's not just you no
[1:03:05] doubt there's all types of things that
[1:03:08] fit into this allocation of the two
[1:03:11] words that he use time appointed well
[1:03:14] the Antichrist cannot be revealed to the
[1:03:16] time appointed Jesus Christ cannot come
[1:03:20] until the time appointed the
[1:03:23] resurrection cannot happen until the
[1:03:25] time time appointed the Rapture cannot
[1:03:28] take place until the time appointed we
[1:03:32] can't even see certain things in the
[1:03:34] word until the time appointed oh think
[1:03:38] of it I'm so glad it's not in my hands
[1:03:41] tonight I'd mess it up sure as a world
[1:03:44] I've been some of y'all's Pastor for a
[1:03:46] long time and I'm so glad that this
[1:03:48] resurrection and Rapture is not based on
[1:03:52] some of us cuz we'd never get out of
[1:03:54] here we would ever leave this world if
[1:03:57] it was based on us brother Nathan but
[1:03:59] it's based upon God's time clock not
[1:04:02] mine and yours because there'll always
[1:04:05] be an element about our old flesh it's
[1:04:07] lazy it will never be what it's supposed
[1:04:10] to be and you know the good thing about
[1:04:12] it God don't even expect it to be God is
[1:04:16] working on our soul and then he will
[1:04:19] make the body match our soul at the
[1:04:22] appointed
[1:04:24] time notice he says he cannot come until
[1:04:27] the time appointed then will come the
[1:04:30] resurrection and then the Earth will be
[1:04:33] renewed again and then he will take his
[1:04:38] possession his possession which he got
[1:04:42] when he redeemed us now that seems so
[1:04:44] odd don't it because whenever we go to
[1:04:47] Walmart or you go to Lowe's to buy tool
[1:04:50] or you go somewhere to buy a plant or or
[1:04:52] a car and you go there and you say well
[1:04:54] I I need a new r will be this or I need
[1:04:56] a new skill Sal I need this that that
[1:04:59] they go out turn and you pay for it you
[1:05:00] walk out with it but the Lord Jesus Paid
[1:05:03] for you but he didn't get to walk out
[1:05:06] fully with you until the appointed time
[1:05:10] why because his mediatorial work could
[1:05:14] not be completed until the last name is
[1:05:18] on the book so think about it that that
[1:05:21] Paul John Peter bolom ideus all the New
[1:05:25] Testament Saints none of them have seen
[1:05:28] the Lord Jesus yet in his Corporal body
[1:05:31] now remember when the prophet was
[1:05:33] carried beyond the curtain of time in
[1:05:35] the sixth Dimension he did not see Paul
[1:05:38] he did not see Luther he did not see
[1:05:41] Wesley he did not see any of those other
[1:05:44] ages he only saw his group so by that
[1:05:48] Vision that translation it would lead us
[1:05:50] to believe that apparently the sixth
[1:05:52] Dimension must be divided similar to the
[1:05:56] ages so Paul is there with his group and
[1:06:00] then uh Luther was his group and the
[1:06:03] rest of the church age Messengers so
[1:06:05] brother R didn't see Peter brother R
[1:06:06] didn't see Andrew he did not see none of
[1:06:09] the Apostles and whenever the lamb rises
[1:06:12] from the father's Throne then the cycle
[1:06:16] of possession will kick in it's
[1:06:19] Unbecoming for them to see him now
[1:06:23] notice he said then he will take his
[1:06:25] possession and his possession which he
[1:06:27] got when he redeemed us but will do it
[1:06:31] at the appointed time notice again he
[1:06:34] said he comes for what to take his
[1:06:37] claims now Oh my he comes to take his
[1:06:41] claims what he done the Kinsman work he
[1:06:45] come down become man died done the
[1:06:47] Kinsman work as Redeemer but had not as
[1:06:51] yet called for his claim it's not just
[1:06:55] based upon me and you it's not just
[1:06:58] based upon you know the demographics of
[1:07:01] our nation the demographics of the
[1:07:02] Nations around the world don't worry
[1:07:05] when it's exactly right all the pieces
[1:07:07] that go to fit together it'll work
[1:07:10] perfectly exactly like it's supposed to
[1:07:13] we're not going to be able to hasten it
[1:07:15] listen to me I don't think there's one
[1:07:18] person here tonight or one around the
[1:07:19] world that has the ability to stop that
[1:07:23] Rapture I don't think there's enough
[1:07:25] devils in hell to delay that Rapture
[1:07:28] almighty God has an appointed time if
[1:07:31] it's in the morning at 6:05 a.m. there
[1:07:35] ain't enough Devils there ain't enough
[1:07:37] people there ain't enough atomic bombs
[1:07:40] there ain't enough presidents and prime
[1:07:42] ministers to stop it from happen at the
[1:07:45] appointed time he will call for his
[1:07:49] bride amen he will make sure that she is
[1:07:55] ready well he'll definitely have to make
[1:07:57] sure for some of us cuz we're so
[1:07:58] slothful won't he but notice he said he
[1:08:01] comes on the scene to claim his rights
[1:08:05] now this is a delayed reaction in this
[1:08:09] cycle of redemption so he paid the
[1:08:11] Redemptive price because he had it
[1:08:14] scattered out over a period of 2,000
[1:08:16] years in seven Church ages so he's going
[1:08:19] to allow it to come in different time
[1:08:22] now the church will go up it'll go down
[1:08:24] it'll go up it'll go out there'll be
[1:08:26] light the light will be put out there'll
[1:08:28] be another light it'll be put out
[1:08:29] another light it'll be put out until it
[1:08:32] comes to the end time then the fourth
[1:08:35] light will come remember there's four
[1:08:38] light rays inside of your body so when
[1:08:41] you get an x-ray that x-ray is not what
[1:08:44] produces the light actually your body
[1:08:47] produces it yourself now as you get
[1:08:49] older the prophet gives a time frame
[1:08:51] there when you get a certain age you
[1:08:52] lose your first light R then when you
[1:08:54] get another age you lose your second
[1:08:56] light Ray and then your third on down to
[1:08:58] your fourth now when you're getting that
[1:08:59] x-ray it's your light was in your own
[1:09:02] body there was four death Messengers
[1:09:05] that kill the church down through the
[1:09:06] church ages and he said there will be
[1:09:08] four life Messengers that will restore
[1:09:12] it so what is it the fourth messenger
[1:09:15] bringing the evening time is also the
[1:09:19] restoration of the forced light so as we
[1:09:23] lose our lights in our natural body it's
[1:09:26] like the spiritual so here come with
[1:09:29] those four life Messengers to bring
[1:09:32] restoration then at the end time will
[1:09:35] come the seventh angel which will
[1:09:37] introduce to the public the son of man
[1:09:40] now the seventh angel is not the son of
[1:09:43] man but he is revealing to the public
[1:09:46] the son of man so what will it do it
[1:09:48] will restore our forth light so instead
[1:09:52] of the Bride losing her lights now he's
[1:09:55] getting all four back what four a body
[1:09:59] change so as we get older we're losing
[1:10:02] one right and one light Ray another
[1:10:05] light Ray another light Ray that's the
[1:10:07] way it was by the four death Messengers
[1:10:10] and as they come to eat up and take away
[1:10:13] from the bride but God said I will
[1:10:16] restore sayith the Lord so God takes
[1:10:20] from the first and the second and the
[1:10:22] third and the fourth and remember the
[1:10:24] seventh Angel doesn't have a certain
[1:10:27] message so he would pull what was right
[1:10:30] from Luther he would pull what was right
[1:10:32] from wesle if you study brother brandham
[1:10:34] very close you'll find brother brandham
[1:10:36] said things that Adam Clark said you'll
[1:10:39] find that brother brandham said things
[1:10:41] that finest date would say that he said
[1:10:44] certain things that that different
[1:10:45] preachers down to the ages would say
[1:10:48] well of course that's what his ministry
[1:10:50] is it's to gather the Loose Ends but yet
[1:10:54] all of that with every one of them
[1:10:56] remember they did not have the fourth
[1:10:58] light and every one of them men that I
[1:11:00] just quoted to you were trinitarians why
[1:11:03] they were living in a light of another
[1:11:05] day come on somebody Clarence Larin if
[1:11:08] you listen to e God of this evil age
[1:11:10] Satan seen you'll get into Clarence
[1:11:12] larin's dispensational truths and look
[1:11:15] down through there you'll find some of
[1:11:17] that stuff in there word for word that
[1:11:20] brother randam said you know why Ken
[1:11:22] Larin had certain things right but like
[1:11:24] a lot of them other guys he didn't have
[1:11:26] baptism right he didn't have election
[1:11:29] right he didn't have predestination
[1:11:31] right he didn't have the godhead right
[1:11:33] why he was under the third light but
[1:11:37] God's going to restore the fourth light
[1:11:40] it will be in that light that the bride
[1:11:43] will have the ability to put out the
[1:11:46] proper
[1:11:47] x-ray because instead of losing losing
[1:11:51] losing she's regaining so what does the
[1:11:54] X-ray do it's able to go beyond the skin
[1:11:57] go beyond the bone marrow be able to go
[1:12:00] inside of you you know and realize that
[1:12:02] that it's shows pictures on the inside
[1:12:04] of you that you can't see with your
[1:12:06] natural eye so when the fourth light
[1:12:09] comes of the Gospel it discerns between
[1:12:12] the spirit and the soul and the body
[1:12:15] it's able to go inside of there and
[1:12:17] capture that c Gene of God and bring it
[1:12:20] to a birth which could not happen in the
[1:12:22] days of Luther that's how come they
[1:12:24] could smoke a pipe and drink beer and
[1:12:26] all that sort of thing you ain't going
[1:12:28] to catch no Holy Ghost filed child of
[1:12:30] God doing that today why because we're
[1:12:33] under the power and the influence of the
[1:12:36] force light which means we're on the
[1:12:38] final cycle of restoration you see he
[1:12:42] cannot claim his bride to come and set
[1:12:46] by him until the four life Messengers
[1:12:50] come and bring it back then when that
[1:12:53] cycle is completed the King can stand up
[1:12:57] and say come my queen the Rapture could
[1:13:02] not have happened in the days of luer
[1:13:05] can you imagine the Lord Jesus taking
[1:13:08] beer drinking pipe smoking people
[1:13:11] straight from this this world straight
[1:13:14] into heaven straight into the paradise
[1:13:16] of God you imagine him in the in the
[1:13:18] west whenever they shouted and that they
[1:13:21] thought that was the Holy Ghost you
[1:13:22] imagine the Pentecostal third light
[1:13:25] whenever they stood there talked in
[1:13:26] tongues and all that sort of thing and
[1:13:29] no doubt a move of God but that was not
[1:13:31] the power that would bring her back what
[1:13:34] is it Force life force life so with that
[1:13:38] life Messengers will come a restoration
[1:13:41] back to the word so there must be a
[1:13:44] people that will walk in such completion
[1:13:47] and Perfection that once The Headstone
[1:13:51] up at the top when that bride reaches
[1:13:53] that spot it will absolutely cause the
[1:13:57] resurrection of all of those that are
[1:14:00] behind us can you imagine there are
[1:14:03] millions of them beyond the curtain of
[1:14:05] time and they are waiting on us Oh Glory
[1:14:09] to God they are waiting for us to come
[1:14:12] to that Perfection remember they without
[1:14:16] us are not made perfect but they were
[1:14:20] part of the body as God was building it
[1:14:22] down Through the Ages so what were they
[1:14:25] a part of the Rob they were a part of
[1:14:27] the life a part of the life so the life
[1:14:31] was moving up to the stassel the stalk
[1:14:33] and all of that the life but what did
[1:14:36] the what died the denominational system
[1:14:39] behind them just like it will be in this
[1:14:41] message there will be a forming of
[1:14:43] denominational little tidbits of here
[1:14:46] and there they're already here in the
[1:14:47] message but yet the real bride is not
[1:14:51] identified with such stuff she's
[1:14:53] identified with the life so the life was
[1:14:56] what moved out of Luther the life was
[1:14:59] what moved out oh I wish somebody would
[1:15:01] hear me tonight it was the life that
[1:15:03] moved out of Pentecost and it's going to
[1:15:06] be the life that's going to move out of
[1:15:08] this world don't you understand it's
[1:15:10] been the life that's been moving in
[1:15:13] these four restoration messages and it's
[1:15:17] going to be the life and the light as
[1:15:20] they couple together that will bring our
[1:15:23] body change it will actually Force our
[1:15:27] body from within to be changed it's
[1:15:31] never been before the messages could
[1:15:34] never have come out of sequence you
[1:15:37] could not have put loer in this day God
[1:15:39] knew better God knew better than to put
[1:15:42] wesy in this day God knew not to put
[1:15:45] Pentecost in this day so then why would
[1:15:48] we want to stop with the Lutheran
[1:15:50] message why would we want to stop with
[1:15:52] the methods why would we want to stop
[1:15:54] with the restoration of gifts we want
[1:15:57] all of that do we believe in
[1:15:59] justification do we believe in
[1:16:01] sanctification do we believe in
[1:16:03] restoration of gifts but we're not
[1:16:05] stopping there we're going on you say
[1:16:07] where we're going to heaven it's the
[1:16:10] moving of the life as it comes up in the
[1:16:14] body amen so watch now he says it this
[1:16:19] way again in the breach and when the
[1:16:21] lamb comes forth not being a mediator
[1:16:23] between God and man he becomes becomes a
[1:16:25] lion when he becomes a lion he takes the
[1:16:29] book that's his rights God's held it the
[1:16:33] mystery but now the lamb comes nobody
[1:16:36] could take the book it's still in the
[1:16:37] hands of God oh my said no Pope priest
[1:16:42] whatever it might be they could take the
[1:16:44] book The Seven Seals hadn't been
[1:16:46] revealed and remember Paul never preach
[1:16:49] the
[1:16:50] seals Paul never even mentions them Paul
[1:16:53] doesn't even mention the seven
[1:16:56] Thunders amen praise the Lord Peter does
[1:16:59] not mention the Seven Seals Peter never
[1:17:02] mentioned the seven Thunders only John
[1:17:05] in the New Testament mentioned them and
[1:17:08] it laid there in the word of God for for
[1:17:10] Millennia of people trying to understand
[1:17:13] it and theologians probed at it and they
[1:17:15] tried to figure it out it was not the
[1:17:18] appointed time but at the appointed time
[1:17:21] my you think the least of the people
[1:17:24] that God would have picked would have
[1:17:26] been a Kentucky preacher that didn't
[1:17:29] even have good
[1:17:31] grammar praise the Lord that didn't
[1:17:34] graduate from high school never went to
[1:17:36] Bob Jones University or you know some
[1:17:39] other great University with a doctorate
[1:17:41] or degree but yet God called such a man
[1:17:45] and gave him a message that would
[1:17:48] actually start a worldwide Revival out
[1:17:52] of that one Commission of a worldwide
[1:17:55] Revival started and that's the way the
[1:17:58] Pentecostal still know him but they say
[1:18:01] at the end he got off wellever they say
[1:18:05] he got off we got
[1:18:08] on Amen look friends you look all over
[1:18:12] YouTube they're still making videos
[1:18:15] about brother brandom I saw one the
[1:18:17] other day of TL Osborne's daughter and
[1:18:19] she's talking about the great things she
[1:18:21] saw and the great things that her daddy
[1:18:22] and mama told her about one Pentecostal
[1:18:25] after another are still making videos
[1:18:29] and talking about what a great ministry
[1:18:31] that brother random had but not the
[1:18:33] doctrines it's not that that they're
[1:18:35] focusing on what they wanted was that
[1:18:38] ability to discern they wanted that
[1:18:41] ability for the Miracles and the
[1:18:43] Supernatural and the signs but they want
[1:18:46] the signs without the forth light you
[1:18:50] see we don't want to be that way I also
[1:18:53] want the signs and we have them by the
[1:18:56] grace of God praise the Lord but I don't
[1:18:58] want the signs and the miraculous
[1:19:01] without the accompanyment of the forc
[1:19:04] life because you can have signs and miss
[1:19:07] the Rapture you can have Miracles and
[1:19:10] miss the Rapture but if you've got signs
[1:19:13] with the force light it's the force
[1:19:16] light that's leading you the right way
[1:19:19] to your body
[1:19:21] change oh praise the Lord don't you love
[1:19:24] him tonight
[1:19:25] my notice he says on down here in
[1:19:28] paragraph or page 101 rather when he
[1:19:31] comes to take his bride amen now he
[1:19:34] comes as king he's looking for his
[1:19:40] Queen now you see as down through the
[1:19:44] church ages he's looking for redeemable
[1:19:48] attributes and also the other the
[1:19:50] category that's in the Book of Life not
[1:19:53] the Lamb's Book of Life and that is the
[1:19:55] whosoever will let him come and take of
[1:19:57] the Water of Life freely so he offers to
[1:20:00] them Grace his grace is so abundant that
[1:20:03] he goes beyond the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:20:06] which is his personal diary and it
[1:20:08] spills over into the book of life so he
[1:20:11] still offering salvation I'm grateful
[1:20:13] for that myself he's still offering
[1:20:15] salvation for in the Baptist or the
[1:20:17] Methodist or wherever more we're not the
[1:20:19] only ones that's saved tonight come on
[1:20:21] somebody we're not the only ones but yet
[1:20:24] we are partakers of the light which goes
[1:20:28] beyond salvation alone I don't know how
[1:20:32] to be saved I've been saved the majority
[1:20:34] of my life come on somebody tell me more
[1:20:37] about how to get out of this world I've
[1:20:39] done got saved I've done been baptized
[1:20:42] it took me a couple times before I found
[1:20:43] the right way but glory to God I finally
[1:20:45] found it so I've been baptized right
[1:20:48] I've been saved I've been Sanctified
[1:20:50] been Justified I spoke in tongues I I've
[1:20:52] laid hands on the sick I've watched God
[1:20:55] straighten out crooked eyes I've saw God
[1:20:57] remove tumors I've seen God do all kinds
[1:20:59] of things before I ever come to the
[1:21:01] message so it was not the Miracles that
[1:21:04] got my attention about this message it
[1:21:07] was what the messenger had to say I've
[1:21:11] done seen all kinds of Supernatural
[1:21:13] that's exactly right so it was not the
[1:21:16] moving of the supernatural that got my
[1:21:18] attention but it's when I begin to hear
[1:21:21] him say words that I had never heard any
[1:21:24] other preacher talk about and there was
[1:21:26] something about that voice oh Hallelujah
[1:21:30] it was not the voice of a Kentucky it
[1:21:32] had nothing to do with him being born
[1:21:34] about 35 miles from where I was born at
[1:21:37] had nothing to do with them squirrels
[1:21:39] being created about 60 mi from where I
[1:21:42] live had nothing to do with the little
[1:21:44] fish being resurrected about 40 mi from
[1:21:47] where I live I live the majority a big
[1:21:49] portion of my life before I come to the
[1:21:51] Lord right there in that little old spot
[1:21:53] in Kentucky never heard the name William
[1:21:55] brandham you know why cuz the time
[1:21:58] hadn't been appointed yet time hadn't
[1:22:00] been appointed and yet Brother brandom's
[1:22:03] house right down there in burksville
[1:22:05] Kentucky I've been there several times
[1:22:07] down to that little place I've been
[1:22:09] right there at Dale Hollow where the
[1:22:10] fish was resurrected been right there in
[1:22:13] them Hollows where the squirrels were
[1:22:14] created seen some squirrels that brother
[1:22:17] Charlie Cox had Frozen that that they
[1:22:20] had killed in 1958 Joe Frozen in a milk
[1:22:23] carton see some of the notes that the
[1:22:25] prophet would would set the doodle and
[1:22:27] write around on the table and hear all
[1:22:29] of that well how come that didn't happen
[1:22:31] to me when I was a boy there was a time
[1:22:35] appointed there was a time appointed and
[1:22:39] just as God appointed my time for the
[1:22:42] light to cross my path so God has
[1:22:45] appointed my time for me to leave this

[1:23:47] gate he's going to bring
[1:23:50] Ruth the good news
[1:23:54] she's
[1:23:55] waiting she's
[1:23:58] nervous she's

[1:24:03] over whose wife will I
[1:24:07] be amen which man will come
[1:24:12] knocking on this
[1:24:16] door Hallelujah she may have had a deep

[1:24:27] keep believing God put us together and
[1:24:30] somehow I just can't keep from believing
[1:24:31] but she didn't know yet exactly until he
[1:24:35] comes to claim his
[1:24:39] possession so he walks to the
[1:24:44] house knocks on the
[1:24:47] door you're imagine Ruth shouting over
[1:24:50] to the
[1:24:52] door Glory
[1:24:55] Hallelujah well I got news for some of
[1:24:57] you around the message that don't
[1:24:58] believe in
[1:24:59] shout God's Prophet said even when we
[1:25:03] get there to Heaven we're going to be
[1:25:06] shouting so for some of you dry hides
[1:25:08] that don't believe in shouting I don't
[1:25:09] know what you all going to
[1:25:11] do amen now notice he said he done all
[1:25:15] this now he comes to take his bride he
[1:25:19] comes now as
[1:25:22] king he's
[1:25:26] looking notice he's not looking to save
[1:25:29] somebody now he's not looking for
[1:25:32] somebody he can heal somebody he can
[1:25:36] redeem somebody he can touch he's
[1:25:39] looking for his
[1:25:41] Queen so here he comes not as mediator
[1:25:46] but he he comes as king he's looking for
[1:25:50] his Queen Amen in this book is the whole
[1:25:54] secret of it wrapped around Seven
[1:25:57] Seals he walks right up to the right
[1:26:00] hand of him remember Brother David de
[1:26:02] with that right hand and took the book
[1:26:04] out of his hand and claimed his rights I
[1:26:08] have died for them I am their kinsman
[1:26:11] redeemer I am the
[1:26:13] mediator now he comes from here at this
[1:26:16] last seal and what does Oh my he do if
[1:26:22] he's a king he has has to have
[1:26:25] subjects his subjects is them that he
[1:26:28] has redeemed and they cannot come before
[1:26:33] him until he takes the rights of
[1:26:38] redemption now all the saints of God
[1:26:41] that have left our assembly our our
[1:26:44] husbands our wives our children our
[1:26:46] aunts our uncles our grandparents all of
[1:26:49] them none of them have have yet seen the
[1:26:52] Lord Jesus Remember When brother brand
[1:26:54] went beyond the curtain of time and he
[1:26:55] said where's Jesus where's Jesus I want
[1:26:58] to see him and whoever it was talking to
[1:27:02] him he said he's higher you can't see
[1:27:06] him
[1:27:06] now and brother Paul I find that so
[1:27:09] amazing because it was like those words
[1:27:13] gave him everything that he needed and
[1:27:16] it settled him and he never ask it again
[1:27:19] now we did ask other questions who are
[1:27:22] these who are them you know what's this
[1:27:24] this watch that watch's that but he
[1:27:25] never one more time asked where's Jesus
[1:27:29] where's Jesus so you imagine each one of
[1:27:32] them when my little girl crossed over
[1:27:36] she got in there where's Jesus he's a
[1:27:38] little bit higher you'll see him after a
[1:27:41] while that's all she needed to hear
[1:27:43] Brother Jim bab crossed over oh my all
[1:27:46] of our brothers and sisters G when they
[1:27:47] cross if they're still inquiring there's
[1:27:50] a deep settle something that resolves it
[1:27:53] see J and brother Junior crossed over he
[1:27:56] end up where where's Jesus where's Jesus
[1:27:58] I want to know where Jesus is no they
[1:28:01] cannot see him until we all see him
[1:28:08] together you see because they're going
[1:28:11] by the way of the grave and they will be
[1:28:14] Sons and Daughters of the
[1:28:17] Resurrection does not mean they're going
[1:28:19] straight into his
[1:28:22] presence it will be one Mass you're
[1:28:26] talking about
[1:28:28] millions millions of children of
[1:28:32] God all of us will look upon him at one
[1:28:38] instant you're imagine a personage that
[1:28:42] is so all
[1:28:45] inspiring that Millions times millions
[1:28:49] of people will be
[1:28:52] overwhelmed by the
[1:28:54] essence of one
[1:28:59] man his presence his his formidable
[1:29:04] character his greatness and when we all
[1:29:07] see him and we're standing there
[1:29:10] breathlessly Oh Glory to
[1:29:14] God they cannot come before him until he
[1:29:19] takes the rights of redemption I'm not
[1:29:21] taking the book in the sense open the
[1:29:24] Mysteries that's already happened that
[1:29:27] happened to us in March of 63 to take
[1:29:30] the book and loose the mysterious part
[1:29:32] of the seal but this taking of the book
[1:29:36] is the word made
[1:29:38] flesh you see Jesus ain't coming for the
[1:29:41] seal book he ain't coming for your Bible
[1:29:44] he didn't say behold I go away to
[1:29:46] prepare book racks in heaven and if I go
[1:29:48] away I will come again and receive your
[1:29:50] Bible unto myself that where I am there
[1:29:53] your Bible maybe also but behold I go
[1:29:56] away to prepare a place for you what
[1:30:00] word made flesh not word made intellect
[1:30:05] word made what you talking about brother
[1:30:07] Donnie you see the word is made flesh in
[1:30:10] an individual when by nature of the new
[1:30:14] births they live that word automatically
[1:30:17] out of their soul it's just like a
[1:30:19] regenerating Force inside of their soul
[1:30:23] and it is that if you're trying and
[1:30:25] struggling and I'm trying to be a
[1:30:27] Christian I'm trying to be a Christian a
[1:30:29] Christian don't have to try to be a
[1:30:30] Christian no more then a sinner has to
[1:30:33] try to be a sinner a sinner is a sinner
[1:30:36] because of his nature oh sure there'll
[1:30:38] be struggles that we'll have but when
[1:30:40] you truly get the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:43] Ghost my friend it is like a
[1:30:45] regeneration from within you it is a
[1:30:49] Dynamo of the Holy Ghost and he lives
[1:30:52] his life out of you out of you out of me
[1:30:55] Jesus is a Christian whether he's in
[1:30:57] your body or my body or brother Scott's
[1:31:00] body that same life lives the same Holy
[1:31:03] Ghost
[1:31:06] path Oh
[1:31:08] Glory he walks
[1:31:11] forth from a
[1:31:15] mediator where death put us in the grave
[1:31:19] he comes
[1:31:21] forth with his rights you see the the
[1:31:24] resurrection can't
[1:31:25] come until the Son of God remember when
[1:31:29] he when he raised up the dead he said
[1:31:31] Marvel not at this for it will come to
[1:31:34] pass that all that are in the graves
[1:31:37] will hear the voice of the Son of God
[1:31:39] and notice how he says that some to the
[1:31:42] resurrection of life and some to the
[1:31:44] resurrection of
[1:31:46] damnation so the Son of God will raise
[1:31:49] them
[1:31:50] all before the white
[1:31:52] throne but we are not going to a white
[1:31:56] Throne
[1:31:57] judgment we're going to
[1:32:01] rewards oh praise the Lord notice here
[1:32:04] he comes he leaves the
[1:32:08] throne as an intercessor as a slain lamb
[1:32:14] to become a
[1:32:15] lion
[1:32:18] king to bring the whole world into
[1:32:21] judgment our Kinsman redeem then is King
[1:32:24] over a he's got the title deed of
[1:32:28] redemption it all Lays within his hand
[1:32:31] I'm glad I know him he says aren't you
[1:32:34] then claims his
[1:32:38] inheritance that's the
[1:32:40] church the
[1:32:42] bride he claims it what does he do then
[1:32:48] he
[1:32:49] disposes of his
[1:32:52] contestant sat
[1:32:55] he throws him into a lake of fire with
[1:32:59] all of those who is inspired by Satan to
[1:33:03] reject his word of
[1:33:07] redemption amen now you see soon this is
[1:33:10] what we're waiting for he will rise from
[1:33:14] the father's Throne as a
[1:33:18] mediator we will never see him in a
[1:33:21] Corporal body as a lamb
[1:33:24] right notice this and Shepherd the Sheep
[1:33:27] F this is a beautiful quote sitting here
[1:33:30] in the Splendor of its beauty on the
[1:33:33] throne of God is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:36] and a Corporal
[1:33:38] body that was raised from the dead as a
[1:33:43] memorial that someday we coming back to
[1:33:48] the
[1:33:51] Homeland praise the Lord never remember
[1:33:54] he was crucified on that great
[1:33:58] feast that great feast of the
[1:34:01] sacrificial land but then in so many
[1:34:04] days later after that remember the high
[1:34:06] priest would go out into the corner of
[1:34:09] the field the field that faced the
[1:34:11] brightest part of the Sun and they would
[1:34:14] cut down a sheath for whatever reason
[1:34:17] that'd always be one spot in the field
[1:34:20] that the grain would mature first and
[1:34:22] they would go out it had to be a pretty
[1:34:24] good siiz handful where a priest would
[1:34:26] be able to take both hands and gather it
[1:34:29] together and be something about maybe
[1:34:30] like this and they would go out there
[1:34:33] and they'd take the sickle and they'd
[1:34:35] strike the bottom of it and they'd take
[1:34:37] it they would take it up to the house of
[1:34:40] God then they would
[1:34:42] wave that
[1:34:44] sheath over the entire Congregation of
[1:34:48] the children of Israel that were
[1:34:49] gathered there on the feast day of the
[1:34:51] Lord and it's the feast of the in
[1:34:55] gathering and what were they doing this
[1:34:57] was the first one that come to
[1:35:00] maturity it was a sign that the whole
[1:35:04] field is going to come to maturity but
[1:35:08] this one come first so here was the Lord
[1:35:12] Jesus in the tide and father allowed him
[1:35:16] to be cut down and then he raised him up
[1:35:20] on the Mount of Ascension and he ra
[1:35:23] waved
[1:35:25] goodbye now what's he doing he's waving
[1:35:29] himself over the people not in a natural
[1:35:33] body but in a glorified body it was not
[1:35:36] a human Temple that had not been
[1:35:39] glorified that was raised and waved over
[1:35:42] the people but it was a resurrected oh I
[1:35:46] hope you're hearing me tonight A
[1:35:48] resurrected body was raised on the Mount
[1:35:51] of Ascension and he waved goodbye to the
[1:35:54] people what's that a sign of Brothers
[1:35:58] you all are coming to the Homeland too
[1:36:01] I'm going to the Homeland today but you
[1:36:04] and your brothers and your children and
[1:36:07] your loved ones they also are going to
[1:36:10] follow me but what kind of body was he
[1:36:12] in a glorified Temple a glorified
[1:36:16] Tabernacle remember what it was they see
[1:36:19] there on the Mount of Mount of Ascension
[1:36:21] it was the tabernacle of God and John
[1:36:25] said I looked into the holy city and I
[1:36:27] saw no Temple thereof for the Lord God
[1:36:30] and the lamb are the temple singular
[1:36:33] Lord God and the lamb are the temple
[1:36:35] thereof so the temple is the human body
[1:36:39] of the Lord Jesus and the Lord God is
[1:36:41] that great shech that will be shining
[1:36:44] all around him merg the father and the
[1:36:46] son together and you get the visible and
[1:36:49] the invisible in one great gigantic
[1:36:52] throne room so he was waved over the
[1:36:56] people as what a a little beaten body of
[1:36:59] a 33 year old man and and you know all
[1:37:02] crippled up and blood all over him no he
[1:37:04] was waved as a glorified Son of God I'm
[1:37:08] going to the homand brothers and I'm
[1:37:11] waving myself over you and I'm letting
[1:37:14] you know you're coming your day is
[1:37:17] coming your day is coming your day is
[1:37:20] coming and you understand when the token
[1:37:23] comes back and waves over your life it's
[1:37:26] your identification there ain't enough
[1:37:28] devils in hell to keep you from
[1:37:30] going oh glory to God thank you Jesus
[1:37:34] one
[1:37:37] day he will
[1:37:39] rise from that Throne yes his father's
[1:37:45] Throne he's not on his own
[1:37:50] Throne he's on the father's throne
[1:37:54] and he will come back and his throne is
[1:37:57] to take the Throne of David on
[1:38:01] Earth so the Lord Jesus has not yet
[1:38:04] received his own Throne don't you see it
[1:38:06] would not be becoming for his wife to
[1:38:09] see him in this position
[1:38:12] yet he don't have his throne he don't
[1:38:16] have his
[1:38:17] crown and he ain't got on his King the

[1:41:23] leaves the Throne of an
[1:41:25] intercessor as a slain lamb to be a
[1:41:31] lion
[1:41:32] king what's the
[1:41:35] transition so he moves from being lamb
[1:41:39] there's no
[1:41:41] need you will no longer need an
[1:41:45] intercessor why you get a New Soul you
[1:41:47] finally got saved you finally got the
[1:41:49] Holy Ghost no you finally got a human
[1:41:52] body that match the work of redemption
[1:41:56] in your
[1:41:57] soul so your eyes will be changed your
[1:42:00] mouth will be changed everything about
[1:42:02] your body will be changed and you'll
[1:42:04] look out your soul will look out now
[1:42:06] remember the three in the resurrection
[1:42:08] is you have the CG which is your germ
[1:42:11] from God a soul of God that was in God
[1:42:13] 1965 soul of God that was in God and
[1:42:16] then you have your theophany what is a
[1:42:18] theophany it's a word formed body that
[1:42:21] you bypass to come here we all know what
[1:42:24] a bypass is you're going around Atlanta
[1:42:26] you're going around all these different
[1:42:27] towns and they got 285 and 385 and 485
[1:42:31] but yet the main rout down through
[1:42:32] there's what 85 so what's the bypass
[1:42:35] you're going around it supposedly it
[1:42:37] gets you more traffic which I don't
[1:42:38] understand since you top 16 times around
[1:42:40] that bypass so here we are we're on the
[1:42:43] bypass we should have come the straight
[1:42:45] regular line from the thought to the
[1:42:47] attribute straight to the flesh man but
[1:42:50] what do we do we byass the theophany in
[1:42:53] order to be tested don't you understand
[1:42:55] but why brother Dar because when it's
[1:42:57] all said and done we're going to sit
[1:42:59] around the Throne of God and out of Our
[1:43:01] Testimony through the ceaseless ages of
[1:43:04] Eternity it will bring honor and glory
[1:43:07] and magnification to our
[1:43:10] King oh can you imagine he could have
[1:43:13] spoke us into existence and said you and
[1:43:16] you and you and you and then he could
[1:43:18] have told us look children I I could
[1:43:20] have been a Healer I could have been a
[1:43:22] redeemer but if of course I spoke y'all
[1:43:24] into existence but instead of him
[1:43:26] telling
[1:43:27] us it'll be
[1:43:30] us telling
[1:43:33] him
[1:43:36] oh I hear the prophet said something
[1:43:38] like this in the adoption series will
[1:43:40] say oh papa
[1:43:43] God I was lost and you saved me Papa God
[1:43:49] I was this and that and you come down
[1:43:52] and be him telling
[1:43:54] me but I'll get to tell
[1:43:57] him praise be to
[1:44:01] God praise
[1:44:05] God when the lamb slang walked forward
[1:44:08] from
[1:44:09] eternity out of the father's
[1:44:12] strong thank you Jesus and took his

[1:55:24] Christ the son of
[1:55:28] God oh praise the Lord can I read two
[1:55:32] more verses of scripture Luke
[1:55:35] 20:34 Jesus answering said unto them the
[1:55:40] children of this world marry and are
[1:55:44] given in
[1:55:45] marriage but they which shall be
[1:55:49] accounted Worthy
[1:55:53] to
[1:55:54] obtain that
[1:55:58] world and the resurrection from the
[1:56:01] dead neither Mary nor are given in
[1:56:09] marriage now Jesus goes on to tell us in
[1:56:13] verse
[1:56:14] 36 neither can they die anymore for they
[1:56:17] are equal unto the angels and are the
[1:56:19] children of
[1:56:20] God being the
[1:56:23] Children of the
[1:56:30] Resurrection well say Brother Don what
[1:56:32] about those of us that are alive and
[1:56:34] remain we also are
[1:56:37] children of the
[1:56:39] Resurrection for the resurrection has
[1:56:42] happened within our souls you see those
[1:56:45] that are alive in in Christ Jesus that
[1:56:48] have raised from the
[1:56:50] dead if the Lord God allows them to go
[1:56:52] by the way of the Grave the prophet says
[1:56:54] these words they are more privileged
[1:56:57] than we
[1:56:58] are do you understand those of us that
[1:57:00] are alive will not go into the sixth
[1:57:06] Dimension we go straight from these
[1:57:10] four to the
[1:57:14] seventh why should we go through the
[1:57:16] sixth that's the holding place this
[1:57:19] blessed holding place where our loved
[1:57:21] ones are
[1:57:23] but we will go straight from this into
[1:57:26] the presence of
[1:57:29] God and here comes all these millions
[1:57:32] myriads of
[1:57:34] angels Lord

[1:58:38] Jesus Lord
[1:58:42] Jesus father how we thank
[1:58:46] you for this great privilege that you've
[1:58:49] given to us to live in this day
[1:58:53] we are so grateful Lord
[1:58:56] Jesus that we've heard this Mighty
[1:59:00] voice the prophet tells us in the
[1:59:02] Rapture
[1:59:04] message that your
[1:59:07] voice will come to this
[1:59:10] call in the last days a shout a voice a
[1:59:18] trumpet a
[1:59:20] message to get your people
[1:59:22] people
[1:59:24] together we have already heard the
[1:59:27] bridegroom
[1:59:29] call I know people struggle over it and
[1:59:32] they just they can't figure it
[1:59:34] out what what we're trying to
[1:59:38] say but in order to make the
[1:59:41] Rapture it's not enough to hear the
[1:59:44] bleeding of the
[1:59:46] lamb from the
[1:59:50] cross many have heard his groans and his
[1:59:55] cries they've opened their heart to
[1:59:58] accept him as
[2:00:00] Savior but the bride must know him in a
[2:00:03] deeper
[2:00:05] way than just being the
[2:00:08] Savior she must know him as her
[2:00:13] mate Brother David beautifully expressed
[2:00:15] this to here on
[2:00:17] Sunday of the dying mate the dead mate
[2:00:22] gives its blood and the living mate
[2:00:25] receives that blood and then it's turned
[2:00:28] loose and as it's flopping its wings
[2:00:32] about it's
[2:00:35] testifying of the Dead
[2:00:37] mate
[2:00:40] Hallelujah we will hear the bridegroom
[2:00:43] call through this
[2:00:46] word and we know it's through the
[2:00:48] revealing of the son of
[2:00:50] man that the son of man will come down
[2:00:53] and make his words so real it will unite
[2:00:57] him and the bride
[2:01:00] together she will not go to the
[2:01:03] marriage but to the marriage supper and
[2:01:06] then he says think of
[2:01:09] it she's
[2:01:11] already
[2:01:14] United Lord if there's one here tonight
[2:01:16] that is not United with you in this
[2:01:19] great way I pray you'd speak to their
[2:01:21] hearts
[2:01:24] it's phenomenal really that he would
[2:01:25] make those statements in August of 1964
[2:01:29] then he would come to the invisible
[2:01:30] Union in
[2:01:32] 1965 and entitled his sermon to the
[2:01:36] invisible
[2:01:37] Union of the
[2:01:39] bride of
[2:01:42] Christ so by then a great
[2:01:45] uniting had already started taking place
[2:01:49] many of us weren't even alive then
[2:01:52] and some of us were just children at
[2:01:54] that time but one day we heard the same
[2:01:58] word and we also
[2:02:01] United Lord Jesus and we're waiting for
[2:02:04] you to
[2:02:05] rise from the mediatorial
[2:02:09] throne and when you do your changing of
[2:02:13] garments will be a sign that we're going
[2:02:16] to change
[2:02:17] ours and we shall be changed
[2:02:22] in a moment in a twinkling of an
[2:02:27] eye
[2:02:29] Hallelujah father I pray there'd not be
[2:02:32] a one of us missing here tonight
[2:02:35] Lord we have children that are backslid
[2:02:37] we have loved ones that are out of the
[2:02:40] Ark father in the name of Jesus move on
[2:02:43] their hearts
[2:02:45] Lord we know there will not be one child
[2:02:50] whose name is in that book
[2:02:52] left here in the time of the
[2:02:56] Rapture oh Jesus we worship you tonight

[2:03:25] never going to go any higher until we
[2:03:28] get to a place that we can forgive
[2:03:31] people being like you is not just laying
[2:03:34] hands on the sick but being like you is
[2:03:37] able to forgive those who have wronged
[2:03:39] us
[2:03:42] terribly and you didn't even wait for
[2:03:44] them to ask for
[2:03:46] forgiveness you forgave them
[2:03:50] already I pray Lord Jesus Your Grace
[2:03:53] would move across this audience tonight
[2:03:55] and those that are
[2:03:57] streaming maybe some's holding grudges
[2:03:59] and holding hard
[2:04:02] feelings may they realize
[2:04:05] really the one that's the most affected
[2:04:08] by that and the most hurt is
[2:04:11] themsel when we hold
[2:04:15] bitterness really we the one that's
[2:04:17] affected the greatest
[2:04:19] SP may we be able to love like you

[2:04:41] Jesus and the prophet tells us that
[2:04:43] eternal life is living for others oh he
[2:04:45] said brother renom I can live for that
[2:04:47] brother he's a good man he said that's
[2:04:49] not eternal life but eternal life is
[2:04:52] living for that man that would kill you
[2:04:57] if he had the
[2:05:00] opportunity no doubt Lord a lot of us
[2:05:02] are still struggling with
[2:05:06] that help us tonight

[2:05:22] oh you might could love me and you might
[2:05:24] could love your favorite people in the
[2:05:26] world but what about those that have

[2:07:12] L hand on the person standing by
[2:07:16] you let's offer a word of prayer for one
[2:07:19] another just just touch the shoulder if
[2:07:21] you
[2:07:23] would father as we have our hands one
[2:07:26] upon the other now
[2:07:28] Lord I pray as a body that you would
[2:07:32] help
[2:07:33] us we're still dealing with our
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:39] Humanity Lord Saturday night was such a
[2:07:42] display of
[2:07:44] that these Servants of God up here
[2:07:47] praying for the people and praying and
[2:07:50] praying The Virtue going out of us until
[2:07:54] we had to be carried back into the
[2:07:58] office and it's amazing Lord as I've
[2:08:01] seen it happen for years that
[2:08:04] sometimes when you get to that weakest
[2:08:07] spot as when you become the greatest
[2:08:12] conduit I don't know how to get there
[2:08:14] sooner I
[2:08:15] would it's just like you pray and you
[2:08:18] pray and you get weaker and it's like
[2:08:21] you reach that spot and then when you
[2:08:25] think I I I need to sit down I I need to
[2:08:28] stop but it's when the anointing is
[2:08:31] Flowing so wonderfully and you think oh
[2:08:34] but I can't stop now I've just
[2:08:37] arrived I've just got where I need to be
[2:08:39] to get myself out of the
[2:08:42] way oh Jesus help us father may you help
[2:08:47] each one of us tonight Lord that we
[2:08:49] would be able to lay ourselves on your
[2:08:52] altar as it were Lord God that your
[2:08:55] gospel can shine through
[2:08:57] us love Through Me
[2:09:00] Jesus heals through
[2:09:04] me forgive Through Me Lord
[2:09:07] God some preachers no doubt will be
[2:09:10] known by the great Supernatural that
[2:09:13] follows
[2:09:14] them some preachers will be made
[2:09:17] known their Fame as we could say it that
[2:09:20] way will be in the prayer lines how they
[2:09:22] was able to pray for people and great
[2:09:25] miraculous took place and others will be
[2:09:27] known by the great understanding of the
[2:09:31] word but also believe there'll be some
[2:09:33] preachers that'll be
[2:09:35] known because they were able to express
[2:09:38] the attribute of
[2:09:39] forgiveness maybe to such a degree that
[2:09:42] other preachers already struggle
[2:09:45] to but each of us are chose to reflect
[2:09:49] Your Glory
[2:09:51] I just say to you tonight use
[2:09:54] me for whatever you can use me
[2:09:59] for when you ordained me you didn't
[2:10:01] ordain that I would be a great gifted
[2:10:04] guy and a great guy to do this and that
[2:10:07] and the
[2:10:08] other whatever you could get Glory out
[2:10:11] of my life for
[2:10:14] father if it's not in the Limelight as
[2:10:16] it were if it's not to where people even
[2:10:18] know anything about it
[2:10:21] it doesn't matter to
[2:10:23] me take me
[2:10:26] Jesus Use Me
[2:10:29] Lord if you want a preacher that needs
[2:10:32] to be publicly
[2:10:34] humiliated laughed at
[2:10:37] ridiculed people call him a blasphemer
[2:10:40] and whatever
[2:10:41] more you need one like that
[2:10:44] Lord if that's what you want from me
[2:10:46] I'll go that
[2:10:48] way it might be a heavy position to car
[2:10:51] [Music]
[2:10:54] but if this is what you've chosen me for
[2:10:57] then you'll anoint me you'll help
[2:11:01] me maybe there's young people here
[2:11:03] tonight
[2:11:05] that you will Express Your Glory through
[2:11:08] them by allowing them to dance and run
[2:11:11] and shout and the Praises of
[2:11:15] God there may be others that will stand
[2:11:18] by and watch them and say oh I wish I
[2:11:21] could do
[2:11:22] that but maybe their way
[2:11:25] is crying and tears pouring out of their
[2:11:30] eyes for we know
[2:11:32] crying is an emotion as
[2:11:36] well oh Jesus whatever you want us to do
[2:11:40] place this
[2:11:42] father according to your
[2:11:45] wisdom let us be what you want us to be
