good to us Song of Solomon chapter 4 verse 12 a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed that plans on an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits campfire was spikenard spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices you ain't got nothing from Big Lots Dollar General no yours is all prams chief spices a fountain of Gardens a well of living waters and streams from Lebanon her response now to all those complimentary things awake o north wind and come down south blow up on my garden that the spices thereof may flow out let my beloved come into and eat his Pleasant fruits and we'd like to be remembered sometimes we pray now would as well let's bow our heads together hold your requests in your heart Lord Jesus what an honor it is to be able to bow our heads we bow them in humility we bow them to the physical place that we came from and if time dare is long enough the place we will return but we're so glad there's another part of us that did not come from dust it came from eternity but Lord while we are here in these mortal bodies we feel the need the necessity dear God to come together to hear your word to sing to worship to pray to us church is not an option we have to have it we die it's not like power lenders and power door locks on a vehicle you can make them an album you can crank them down and pull them with your fingers the church is not so with us Lord praying reading your word hearing the preaching of the word we absolutely have to have it because our need is so great that's why you supplied in such a great way and we thank you for that I pray that should help us tonight father help me to be able to get out of the way Lord as I'm never to move myself aside may the Spirit of God and North the gift that part of yourself that you placed within me Lord help me father help the people that they can be able to receive as well that we can be able to hear sings tonight Lord that will benefit our walk with you for truly we believe that we are in this great wedding night speak to us tonight father will forever give you the praise and share it with no man in Jesus name Amen probably she saying she may be seated how many's happy happy to be a Christian what an honor it is to be able to serve the Lord in this hour to be identified with him my mind goes back to this setting tonight so much different than ours him and her alone in the room and there was no trouble there was no heartaches no anxiety no sin not saying there wasn't nervousness and maybe jittery and all that sort of thing on her part for the great king is fixin to take her as his own possession so much different than us and our wedding night which is truly where we are many of us have been here for quite some time we've been married to the Lord Jesus and this night been prolonged for some it's decades for some of you maybe 5 10 15 years for some of you it's 20 30 40 that you've actually been in this night with the King you have been able by the Spirit of God to shut the outside world from your soul you've been able by the power of transformation to move into a sphere into the realm of eternity where mortality has broke from your soul and you've truly been born again by the breath of Jehovah but yet because you are a creature of time you're still held captive by these elements that's in your body which have not yet been saved in your soul your soar in heavenly places in your body and your spirit you battle you deal with sickness and disease and trouble heartache day in and day out get one thing resolved and three more things takes its place you get that taken care of and something else comes against you so your wedding night the setting of it is somewhat different than hers when she went into this beautiful place which had been renovated for this specific cause and purpose nothing was quite like it no doubt that she had ever seen she'd moved into this place to be able to receive the very life of the king himself he had used this room many times no doubt but it had been renovated or transformed to be able to meet her and his particular need and that was a bridal chamber unlike what we go through today that the servants were on the outside the people who was making revelry and whatever more they were without the palace inside this room it was her and him alone truly it can be reflected in a mirror image of how we are in our soul but in the natural realm it is so much different friends the world about us constantly was an onslaught of trying to mold us shape us and conform us into their image we are living in a world that constantly is being changed many of us that are 40 50 60 years old even some younger than that you have seen so many changes in this world that we are living in in the political way in the social way in so many ways the world is being changed and many I'm afraid feel life that they are not pulled toward the world because they dress different from the world and that's a set value with many of us many of you do not dress in the fashions of the world or ungodly sayings and you feel like you're free from the conforming of the world and when you get to that place you're in a very dangerous situation because Satan simply changes his way about which he wants to conform us and pull us into the imagery or our behavior or things which will resemble the world but yet a person can resemble the world in their mannerism and their habit and certain other things that they do and yet on the outward appearance nothing like the world at all they don't smoke they don't drink they don't go to worldly places they got their mannerisms their behavior and much of what is around them is being changed day by day now let us look back at this again in 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 9 Paul says for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more to see ministration of righteousness exceeding glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excels now here he's talking about of course the law which was given to the children of Israel and the glory was so great that is shined upon the face of and so much that they had to put a veil over Moses face because of the glory it was a shared glory as the moon shares the glory of the Sun now we know the moon actually has no glory of her own but it is a reflected glory which is borrowed from the Sun itself and when the moon turns around of course and reveals itself in four stages it is because that the darkness of the earth or the shadow of the earth is hitting on the moon in a certain way and it produces first quarter second quarter third quarter and then it moves around to where it is a full moon again simply because it is a borrowed light if she had her own light then the shadow of the earth would not be able to reflect it in the way that it does so Moses when he comes down from the mountain it is a borrowed light from the glory of God and Paul talks about how great that glory was but he said the glory that was to come which is the glory of the gospel exceeds that glory because it Exelis that glory and the church said now we know that the gospel as well is revealed in glory stages in so much said it wasn't was revealed in the book of Acts initially and the Spirit of God fell upon the original Church God could share his glory in that it was the firstfruits of the resurrection or the wave sheaf become fifty days after his own resurrection and Jesus being the firstfruits of the humanity that was raised from the dead but whenever God now knew that it would not last in that stage it would go down to the dark ages of the church ages and die and be raised again so it has been exceeding in glory from Luther from Wesley to Pentecost up to where we are tonight we believe on the final phase do we not now that glory of loser would have no glory by reason of the glory which excelled so if you would compare a flashlight to a new LED light well there's hardly no comparison at all if you compare most of the bulbs that you and I were raised with the CFLs and our lot or the incandescent light bulbs that you and I had our if it was a hundred watt bulb then it burned a hundred watts but now a hundred watt and an LED equivalent will burn about 1718 something like this so you're burning 1718 watts but because it is a total new design by the LED it is much more is much more efficient and you get a brighter light and actually you get more life because when it turns on it does not put the surge to it the way that the incandescent bulb it so that glide now is it a life it is a vintage of course incandescent will be out phased out nobody'll even want them anymore because they blow easier they're much easier to be able to the filament to break on the inside it's the same way with looser wetsy and Pentecost was it alight in that day it was but it was like a very dense incandescent compared to a light bright illuminating LED light in this day praise the Lord now I'm worried about you little energizer bunny we just keep on running and we never run down so it's not like that we've got to have revival come through and this man comes in and brings a revival we have revival within ourselves now we need syrup of course we know that but there's a pile this life that's on the inside that is the glory that excels even that opit accost I remember the days of Pentecost whenever you had to get an advances to come around get the people all fired up again it lasts for a few weeks or months or maybe six weeks and then you'd have to get another and come in and fire them all up some folks around the Misses are still that way today but if you ever get the real baptism of the Holy Ghost you have living wells of water inside of you that's what he said about the Shulamite that's the real bride now notice this in verse 11 for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious and verse 15 but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart now I was talking about the children visit whenever they read Moses or the law whenever they do read that the value which was symbolic on Moses face it's now transferred upon the hearts of the Jews so they now bearing the image of the veil so it was mailed to them and now it's failed again but what if God reversed that in that he unveiled the veil in Christ and then those who now look upon him they are not looking upon him in the veil sense but they also are unveiled as well now because Moses was veiled those who read it now are veiled because Christ was unveil those have become his seen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost they have become quicken then they also are unveiled as well nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now notice in verse 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty boy have I quoted this for years and years and Pentecost and how is use that in this I heard many preachers use it the same way in the way of shouting so where the Lord is there is Liberty so we've come together or not and we're going to beat the drums and clap our hands and bang the tambourines and beat the piano and break the strings on the guitar and we're going to shout because we're the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty when you look at it in reality he's not even talking about shouting he's talking about us being born again and being able for the veil to be removed from our heart maybe we believe in shouting certainly we do now watch the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty whether the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty so it's not just so much Liberty in the service it's you bringing your Liberty in the service and the Lord is in you and you are free then we should be able to have a free service honor tonight that's right but notice now Paul goes into another phase of this and he said but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord but we always an open face now our face is not veiled but with an open face we are beholding the glory of the Lord look at this word of the meaning of this word that beholding it as in owners in a glass Paul said and it is to show in a mirror to make to reflect to mirror to look at oneself in a mirror to behold oneself in a mirror I said beholding in a glass the glory of the Lord oh my goodness beholding oneself in a mirror but yet all said beholding the glory of the Lord how we going to behold our self in the mirror when Paul said what we're looking at is the glory of the Lord because it's not you so much it's not me so much it's the reflected glory after the new birth I notice this is an order that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty then God frees us from the tradition although I'm no good I'm sorry I'm rotten I'm no camp no we were that but by the grace of God we are beholding our renewed self in the mirror by which the glory of God shines upon our face now notice he said that we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord now we're looking at ourselves but were accident we're looking at ourselves but we're actually seeing the glory of the Lord now look if you've got something in your heart something in your life that's not right with god and the word brings that to your attention fix that thing it is straightened up and taken care of so when you behold yourself at the Spirit of God in you liberates you from tradition then you behold yourself in the mirror of the word that you're actually going to look beyond your humanity your shortcomings your faults your failures and you're going to see the glory of the Lord why because the Spirit of God has transformed you and changed you if all you're seeing is yourself over and over and over again you need to move up praise your experience needs to be renewed was God now notice he said so we are beholding in the glass now this is not a water glass of course but it was a looking glass which at this time would have been a piece of metal burnished metal as in a glass the glory of the Lord and we are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord so that would dwell in us it not only frees us from sin and liberate sus from the things of the world it actually leads us to the power of transformation now even though we're integrate the time as far as darkness in the world but you and I both know that the greatest time for light to shine is in a time of darkness you know we need the light to shine when it's broad daylight do you so in this time of darkness is when the brightest life that's ever been on the earth the bright light and the bride time is really going to shine out now watch this the Weymouth translation says that this way we mirror the glory of the Lord with unveiled faces we looking as in a mirror catch the light and reflect the glory of the Lord now this is a spiritual process of course it is a spiritual nature alone which is capable of being able to catch that light now think of it this way that there are many many pieces of space junk and meteors and all kinds of things as flying around out here near the earth but the moon is the one by which God chose to reflect the special light of the Sun now what we're not Mars why not Neptune why not you do we know from the construction of the planets of course according to how much metallurgical things is in the content of the planet that's how much illumination ability that it has the more iron ore the more certain metals of that and that is the construction by the creative power of God that he put it inside of those and the moon is made just right so she's got enough metallurgical things on the inside that she can be able to hit it now what if the light of the Sun would hit the handkerchief project it would not reflect anything at all it's going to go right there and not bounce back so the moon is so designed by the creative power of God that govern their life would be able to shine upon the moon and it would be able to what bounce it back off of it but what is that you know you've seen pictures of the well as well as I have and then looks like great craters and dust and all that it's not shiny it's not illuminated but it is a boring life but it's made so that when the light of the Sun is able to hit it it bends it and it comes right back what causes it to bear it's a metallurgical makeup that's on the inside of the moon that God gave it those attributes what he made it in the beginning so he made her that way it's the same with you and I what makes us different than the rest of the world what makes us different now than what we were years ago it's the spiritual metallurgical makeup of our soul that catches the Word of God and when the sunlight of God shines upon it it bends and comes right back other people's Europe then they fond of it the life item and many are hanging around it for years and years and they go away but why don't you do it because it's your spiritual metallurgical makeup that God put it in use Oh hallelujah you are held by gravitation by the Spirit of God they cover tonight Brenda there were this up in Lima last week God I've said here before the let me say it again that when you look at the globe of the earth to sell how it hangs out on the universe and you can see why that for many many years ago that's all kazeer for slack because how in the world would people be able to sell to be able to live on if there's any other dimension other than being flat itself but looking at a globe is you and I have done and you say here we are hanging on the side and you look at the equator and you've got people down around the middle of the globe of the earth and according to where they're standing they're actually standing on the side of this bowl like this so we're standing there like this and they get rain and rain clouds come over them and the rain don't go this way the rain goes in this way now you look at the bottom of the earthy Antarctica how is it that that water and that ice and all that ocean don't fall off the bottom I always said that whenever these people go down there do all these expeditions on the bottom of the come on they go on the very bottom of the Gulf how is it that their ships don't fall off how is it that the ocean hangs on the very bottom you try to do that on the baseball when you go home after church you try to take anything you want to see it on the bottom of the baseball or take given the baseball of ass and you watch what the water will do the water will automatically drip off the bottom will it not why because the baseball is not magnetized by gravitation and ordered older so people can be on the bottom of the earth and they're standing upright this is up right down there and there's all them animals are down there roaming around the polar bears and the Penguins and whatever board and the clouds when winter time and all that comes the clouds will come here under the bottom side and drop snow uppers you saying we ain't got a mighty car you think we ain't got a mighty God and you've got problems that's too big for him to take care of hallelujah hallelujah so the moon has this nature if I can say it that way to where she has the capability of catching the Rays of the Sun bending it back and throwing it back toward the earth now it's a similar than with the spiritual nature of those who are truly born again they have the ability to look into the mirror of the word and the Rays actually bend off of the mirror and flashes back into their face so they're capable then of giving forth what they are what they are hearing and what they are living notice is posted but we always open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed out of this word change Metamorpho which is transfigured transformed to change into another form change into another form transform transfigure cause appearance was changed with a responsive and divine brightness on the Mount of Transfiguration and yet Paul says that we are also are change as we look into the glory of the Lord don't you understand why it's so important what you looking good believe it or not we're not the only ones being changed other folks are being changed in this world now what they look at now what they look at come on now marriage traditional marriage is being rotated around the world why because people are looking at two men or two women are now looking at that and raising kids under that they are being changed in their mind that traditional marriage is no longer traditional marriage come on now Church don't get quite of it they are looking at so many things on television and movies and books and so on and it is slowly changing their thinking it is changing there they are conforming to the world but not conforming we are transformed we are not being conformed to this well that we are being transformed amen also may I said can't you see what Satan would want you to put your eyes upon a preacher all upon some manner honor he's so great and he's this and he's out of the other that's all you think about that's all your talk about oh he's the greatest gifted man don't do that friends of nobody thank God for the gifts that are among us but there's only one great one among us and that's easy that's right because if we're not careful the more we look at that individual we will begin to conform to them and we'll become what they want what they like what they are we had credit to the servants of God and we thank God for them but we want to be transformed into the image of Jesus Christ not some preacher cause all mental failure now the illusion is you know it's hard for us to understand because if we could pick up a mirror or we welcome to the bathroom we look in our automobile there's a rear-view mirror mirrors on the side it's quite different of what we look at today than what they would have looked at there but it is a mirror that was made out of a piece of brass or a burnished piece of metal now when they would take this metal and they would polish it and polish it and polish it so if you're standing there looking at this piece of metal and light is Slone on this piece of metal that you have in your hand unlike the mirror today which is made with a backing to reduce the amount of glare and the amount that hits you back in the face according to the amount of light that was hitting this piece of metal it's going to come and hit that metal and it's going to bounce right back on you or Gloria the mirror today of course well I'll do that let's just direct light at a certain angle and you're sending at the right angle to be able to receive it but then the light that would have hit that metal because the metal had properties that the glass mirror does not have today in that it would Bend the light and cause the light to come right back out so if you were standing there with a piece of burnished metal in your hand and you were looking in that mirror and the light was super super bright and she was looking on that what happened was people standing around you would people stand around you would see that light hitting the mirror and they would see the light being bent and they watch that light come right back on your face so you are you are becoming the very mirrored image of the light that was in what that's what the gospel is that's what Paul is saying that we are changed into the image of the Son of God so as we hold a mirror of the word and we let him wash us and cleanse us I'm sanctified and purify us from the things of the world and the unbeliever world the more that happens the more that light shines upon her face unlike moses who had to put a veil upon his face god what's the glory to shine out of our lives God wants every man woman boy girl every teenager whatever more to be a life of the gospel that people can look at you and say that is a Christian all-na now imagine it as a person holds this mirror in the hair and the light is coming from behind them will say like this which would be the strength of the light and as they're looking inside of this and it is so black they can barely see themselves but they're looking through that to see themselves but they're seeing themselves through the bent light as it strikes the polished metal now as it does that they're peering through and they've got to break through two dimensions as it was because of wanting to see the image of their self it's my hair straight or mossad burn straight if I get anything on the face so they're looking through that but at the same time they may not even realize how much the bent light is reflected back on there but others are sending they're looking at them and they're thinking my goodness it effect that light is so bright on their face Oh hallelujah I'm sure Fred that none of us will ever be able to see the fullness and the strength of the glory of God on our lives I've other people will why because the way the light is built and refracted and comes right back upon us we can't see we can't see look at what God's done in our lives it become so common to us and if we're not careful it becomes so monotonous and yet other people think nah not y'all are so blessed y'all are so blessed to be able to go to church like that you're so blessed to be able to have that word you're so blessed of what God's done for you I wish I could live right you know just something like living right every day and you take it for granted say well it's just something I do I'm a child of God you realize there's millions of people out in this world that cannot live right from day to day they cannot live right from week to week they do not have the power of God in their life to help them live right I'm talking about preacher standing in the pulpit they cannot overcome loss they cannot overcome adultery they cannot overcome hi and you do it every day of your life how do you do it because of the reflected light of God as we are beholding the glory of the Lord Jesus it is changing us from justification to sanctification from sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the life change will be the body change was it coming from not from us it's coming from him Palmer so we place ourselves within the light of the gospel and the reflected light of God actually changes our own image Oh how's this how's this going onto the day what is not what do you know when your sisters got man you look like a soul of a scarecrow but just come out of a cornfield you come into your husband like a hair sticking up this land you had cold fries and a curse second you're out there yes ma'am allow that disgust me to this brother would your husband - he's still been running with me so what do you do you want your hand place my you pick out your certain dress you're going to get married in then the one you're going to leave the church in and all that sort of thing you think of through and you want everything just right is all right why because it's a special night well let me tell you something that might have been special but it's not they're special as this night is right here that's night I'm talking about the wedding night out Christ and the bride as we don't get to pick out our clothes he does amen we could never provide the clothes that we need but he says don't worry sweetheart and then I'm going to provide you with the white garments shining glistening white I want to provide you with a crown I'm going to provide you with the shoes of the gospel I'm going to provide you with bodyguards it's going to be able to transport you to this world of darkness I've gotta tell you everything you need this is a special night sweetheart and it ain't going to be one night it will be as long as you need it if you need it for 30 years I'll take care of it if you need it for 50 years hey Tara how long do you need and I'm going to give it to that because I've gotta break you home Romans 8:29 for whom he did beep he did beep to be beeped to the BPD beep beep and sounds like a Volkswagen Richard on it I'm not scared of the Word of God I'll look for him he did for no so I said the song hey man for me did foreknow he did also home ah he did also did predetermine their destiny to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren who could conformed fashion likened to adding the same form as another similar or conformed to it describes what is the essence in character and thus complete or durable not merely a form or an outline God don't want all of us to look like Hoffman's head of Christ hobo don't shake you too Babbitt in reality if you're born again tonight you look more like Christ and Hoffman said oh Jesus Alleluia is a good to be conformed to the image of his son why that it would be the first model or the first perfect one and more sons would look like that what on the outside the long hair the long road I'm grabbing on to are long robes and sandals I hate sandals I'm loving work she's a lot use the toes in them I'm God we don't have to go out longhand grow a beard no that's sort of thing that's not the end it's God water but it's the spiritual image so we are conformed now this is a spiritual confirmation of course - made into the image of our Lord Jesus this is why it's so great right now friend what is going on the world is groping in darkness our world has never been in the shape she's in you heard it yesterday I'm sure just like I did that North Korea again lost another listen either people tore all the pieces scared to death I scared are you now I can't get us ain't no way before their missiles ever come across we'll be sailing out of here hallelujah saying how are you well very well so we are conformed to his image of his temperance his image of his life the image of his ability to forgive the image of his ability to love those who hated him the image Homer that he bore upon the earth as a god man with meekness and patience and forgiveness come on now it's a whole lot harder to be lost out to grow long hair and have a beard if that's how the hippies has got it on us that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so he's the first human being the after passing through death was raised to eternal life to remain in eternity Oh separate that only in Old Testament these people raised from the dead they were but they all died again but he raised from the dead and will never die again he was the first unity here is the first human nature that was glorified in the glorification of eternal life it had never been done before humans were raised from the dead has been for a long time but never had this happened on the earth since Adam fell that God raised a human being and glorified Oh hallelujah can't you see why he's worthy of our praise and honor oh I realize they support ignoramuses around this message someone tell me not long ago they talk to somebody around this message been around for years and years and they said when they sit in their church and people worship Jesus they didn't worship Jesus Jesus what where is it to be worshiped heathens friends you ought to thank God for the truth you come here three times a week level set down here you know it's put up your guard with a bunch of tribes and a bunch of nonsense so then it become common to you you imagine people around our message saying such tommyrot well because a bunch of men who held up some image of some man and their instead of being like Jesus Christ remember the prophet of God never brought us such trash oh ma Oh says be not conformed to this world actually those two key words we'll look at here that is world in age the Greek worship for ages a honored members know that meaning the present age in contrasting to the age that is to come so we're not conformed to the world but we are transformed in other words don't let this age conform you to be like them because there will be a constant pressure oh my to their scheme of thinking so don't be conformed to this world under the word there is scheme so it is their way of thinking so the word rendered conformed means to put on the form of the fashion or the appearance of another all my so it can be anything about another person that is contrary that is devoted the Spirit of God it can be the way they talk it can be the way they Jess it can be the words they say the music they listen to you don't have to ask even dress like them to be like them it's your spirit that's like their spirit oh my well praise the Lord you parents know as well as I know that sometimes you can tell who your kids have been playing with even if you haven't seen them because the things they're saying the way they're acting well I'm going to preach all going appreciate me Oh hallelujah we want to be like Christ friends Zachary look if you need an image that we all do we need somebody's image mirror well if you did pick out a good old ago still safe notice this the Jerusalem Bible says it this way do not model yourselves on the behavior of the world around you the Living Bible says don't copy the behavior and customs of this world the paraphrase of JB Phillips States don't let the world around you squeeze you into its own nose don't let the world around you squeeze you and to its own mold so the idea of these verses is basically during the same talk that the world around us is going to try to make us conform to what they think we ought to be now if they think this is right and this is right and this is right then they want us to make you do not want to leave you alone and so well we believe what we believe in you believe what you believe they're not going to leave you that way they want to change you to get you to believe what they believe then you go to hell with them well already I didn't come from hell and I ain't going back to hell that's exactly right but I've got to believe this word to stay out of hell so instead of being fogger conformed to the world Christians are transformed or changed by the power of God how our house is done by looking into the mirror of his word now somebody that plays golf somebody that hunts somebody that dishes some other does this they're the other and they have all kinds of magazines according to whatever your particular alike is and I'm not saying that's wrong necessarily all kinds of websites the caters the golfers or hunters or this or that and that's why they sell new equipment all the time because here's this super string that Mar just flings that are so much nicer and yours a fashion bullet in a better scope and here's a better iron that can help you stand there and knock that ball down further and beat oh what's his name and they're all my here's a better recipe is about better cooking pan it's a miracle pan you don't have to wash it no more it puts in vitamin A vitamin c vitamin d vitamin everything into your cooking it'll make you live 20 years longer there's something wrong with your mind if you believe that but what does he do the world you're at they see it a whole mama remember brother I'm talking about seeing a television program and they put this open the thing he saw attacks didn't even have to watch the plate just dip it down and then pull it out he said I thought I'm going to be a hero when I go home so he got that step ahead he put it down inside the water put it up put the put of real played on the head eggs and bacon whatever more dipped it down and out water pull it back out just what the eggs and the bacons right on there still he said I'll never believe what else I see on television now you realize it what is it Satan has learned that we have this ability to be able to be influenced by things that are around us and we're influenced by what her parents say what her friends say what religious say what professors say what teachers say well your mentor say and then we become that if we're not careful building outside may remain the same but our spirit becomes changed gradually and as it does we're pulling away from the word most people know that side overnight they don't backside from Sunday morning to Wednesday night they're in the process of backsliding for a long time well I hope you folks are appreciably I come to have Church I'm not sure if y'all want to go to Dairy Queen of what I come to that church today so no pattern after this age all the times that we live in because what it does it becomes between you and the reflected image of what's that now if another person 6r handout and another and puts their hand and their idea their idea and every person that puts a hand between you and that mirror it's gonna not part of them race not only part of the race coming to the mirror but part of the race bending back off the mirror and shining on your face so here's this blessing mirror you're sending that a hold of it oh my so illuminated but then the soul thing comes in and then something else comes in another person six her hand and their idea their opinion and this little sin and that little sin and before long you can't see yourself nobody else can see crush on you you become miserable you come to a spot you're contrary your whole mind you're not in a good mood like a child of God out of thee and you wonder what in the world is going on where's the mirror on your face brother am i good to see you folks still come to the house of God with a big smile on your face the greatest sailor do you come back it's a drudgery Omar are you coming in able to receive something from the local presence of God why have you got this person there but I didn't like the songs I sang lots of temperatures too hot the sound system is way too loud the piano was still out that guitarists pumping too much for me too many symbols too much understand what's going on somebody's hands somebody's opinion somebody's hands somebody's opinion it's less like coming over your shoulder which means less light on your face and you're going to walk out there in the world of darkness and you're going to feel such despondency and such a low empty feeling in your life when you had the privilege of drinking from a well of living waters and letting the glory of God shine upon your face but too many hands got in your way Romans chapter 12 verse 2 be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind not the renewing of your soul now what your soul has changed is changed forever it can never go back the other way but your mind is constantly on an onslaught our mind but the skin needs to be renewed daily we need this constant renewing in our mind resort notice being transformed and the Greek word is a very radical change from one nature and life to another a very radical change well praise God it is the word Metamorpho which has given us our word metamorphosis what a tadpole is changed into a frog or when a grub becomes a butterfly we speak of it as metamorphosis to Renan tell somebody god bless your brother and sister Grubb bless you brother Grubb horn for the robbed grub for the Larry grub bless you sister grubs sister tadpoles hey I don't mean that in a non uncomplimentary I'm complimenting you thanks tonight I see something you're just fixing to be changed amen now it's radical it's radical it means a total change from the inside out have you ever seen a tadpole go to tadpole transformation school have you ever seen a grub worm packing his little grub worm bag inching down the road going to Happy Valley High and if you could shop on the side of the road go to there in a world where you're going I'm going to be transformed I'm going to high school and then I'm going to college and I'm going to give me a degree and as far as I go on my knowledge I'll be transformed no he won't he will only be transformed by the law of life which is in his nature now little grab worm couldn't even spell his own name if he had one he couldn't even spell growth he don't know how to spell he don't know how to write all he knows is whenever he was born in his ramaa laid him out there and all his little brothers and sisters and his mama picked out the certain tree and most of these butterflies you know they like a certain tree most grubs that transform that way a certain tree or a certain bush you know that many of the butterflies out in the milkweed so they pick certain areas for the milkweed is now this mother butterfly has never had a botany class she never excelled in biology she never knew anything about plant ology or how to fly ology all she knows is there's a drive in her and she's after flying around through all these hundreds and thousands of species and she comes right over to a milkweed and she goes under the bottom side and she deposits her legs and when she goes to making all this thing and giving birth to another generation and when the little guys come out of there they have one thing in 9/8 now some of y'all can relate to but some of you just woke up when I said eat that's all they do is eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and also co-wrote a song called in peace a nice a nice Annie's that's what you're supposed to do as a child of God eat and eat and eat and eat until you hate yourself and to a transformation I am going to try to mimic it to knock is there ain't nobody I've ever seen preaches that can do that brother Jewell oh praise God what is it a radical change so they eat and eat and eat and eat and he did wonder being 600 times better than they were on ever born then all of a sudden something begins to move on they begin to spin expand this self-destructive case and they move into it and their body begins to liquefy from within their body brother J begins to liquefy and do a black gooey something and make you sick if you saw it the resemblance of kidneys of stomach of intestines is totally gone and it starts changing itself once it reaches the stage of corruption something changes now it starts forming a new digestive tract starts making wings which had never had in its first life to go starts making aunt Annie its eyes change to where it can have 3d vision signs have just caught up on that you know you have to wear glasses and all that sort of thing to see 3d butterflies spend dinner for a long time to have a different digestive tract the blood pressures differ the hardest difference every internal organ every entire logic is different and in their first light [Applause] hallelujah whenever Organists form on his long slender legs and their antennae and they've now reached that thing into good they got a bustin out and they come out walking around them 3d vision eyes the wings still the king fly so they have to give them a little wild be transformed a little small pump type thing on the inside of the body their antennae are all rolled up and they go to blow and there ain't any out Kapow use of that word for you these are the Wang's go spread spread and you look answer look at how powerful it is so beautiful and people travel the globe butterfly watchers they go to the Andes they go to the Congo they go all over the world just watch them that's a real Christian better blue peoples got their glasses on you could that better find evidence of there's no way it could not transform itself you could not change yourself only by the law of God's nature within it it's in its DNA imagine the monarch butterfly sometimes second and third generation is if I go to Mexico they disappear for years both scientists ever even knew where they were wasn't even until the eighties to the found out some peasants down there Mexico's in the mountain found out where all the millions and millions of monarchs fly and they fly rattle of the Gulf of Mexico they don't all get together on a 747 or a Boeing 737 roll and get a little ticket but they fly all those miles across the ocean who Direction many of them in that generation have never even been there before they don't know where New Mexico is from Old Mexico or anything else all they've known as Wisconsin and Missouri and Tennessee but all of a sudden Sun begins to drive them and they take off we're not going I don't know but I'm following my leader however I'm not talking about a goose I'm not talking about an eagle with three-foot wings I'm talking about a butterfly about why I'm they fly and they fry fine if I go to tell me how hard it is to be a Christian don't you tell me I can do it if I let up any butterfly confront of Mexico how the command of God don't tell me you can't live a godly life by the power of God in your nature I don't believe it I'll simply don't believe it if you're born again it is an endowment God [Applause] [Music] Careca God watch Jesus then it's the law of life in their nature I'm gonna go ahead and say some of you think I'm nuts anyway you think I've lost my mind the prophet of God says the power of God that'll raise you up is in you right now as a matter of fact he said you'll call your own body from the dust of the earth [Applause] be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind noose Newell's the Greek pronunciation of it comprising a light the faculties of perceiving and understanding are those of feeling judging determining the power of considering and judging soberly calmly and impartially Omar judging the power to judge brother sister if we ever needed it we need that now the world wants to control you by controlling your mind God what's the transform your mind not control it the world wants to change your mind now just change your mind in the way you do think so for politics social media the wrong people all that brings pressure to try to get us to conform and change to the world this is why folks have left the messages whether left the message in the days of all in the days of Noah because somebody changed there Matt it only got to their mind never dropped in their heart somebody else come and change your mind and when they did then they go this way well they wouldn't grow up in the first place there might have been grub doubt with the grubs but there's probably a polecat or something else but anyway they was not a great because if there's a god that had that law with him to change them into beautiful butterfly hey man so if the world controls your thinking you are a conformer if God changes your thinking you are a transformer not only have you been transformed but you are a transformer yourself and we are living in a world that is hostile to God and his truth I married a couple scriptures more closing Romans chapter 8 verse 6 for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life in peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be seized and suturing among whom also we had a conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind now both of them work together of course and were in sin and he said we were by nature the children of Wrath even as others others Ephesians 4:17 this I say therefore justifying the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened notice this being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness what that's the world we're dealing with though we're dealing with things you don't have to be honest you don't have to be people of integrity and people of character if he says 422 that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful of and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that you put on the new man the butterfly a man put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness let's stand together praise be to God [Music] all my friends look at your wedding night therefore where you look you're assaulted you can't drive from here to Walmart without seeing billboards either with cigarettes or some half dressed woman you can't even check out at Walmart but having all kinds of magazines to your left and to your right that has all concentrations nonsense on it if we look you can't even go to Lowe's to buy two before without hearing rock and roll you can't go to Bed Bath & Beyond to my wash rag without rock and roll going and you know - since our kindness in my everywhere you go anymore yes now what you're doing getting I'm ready for the Tribulation Period everywhere we look then you go to your job man less you're been able to work with Christians and it's constantly there everywhere you are and then sometimes coming to the house of God it's bad enough in the world but when addressing so bad people so carnal that you have to deal with some of the same stuff in church prays for the darling what is it trying to change your mind change your view look friends in our lifetime how many things have changed 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago people would have never thought of doing things that they're doing today little by little by movies by music by books magazines by articles little by little that change them they change and then they're sinking this honey wrong no more is it really I kill Jews read the polls read the polls about marry marriage read the polls about Christianity read the polls about much of this stuff and see and our generation brainless watch went with it was it gone why conforming nods and not in the middle of this darkness you are setting in your soul with the king and the King brought this mirror generates the woman that packs the mirror but in this situation the King backs it and it turns it around to you and he wants the personification of his own glory to be able to hit that mirror and he wants you to look into the mirror at the same time that the glory is shining so the mirror can be able to bend the light and reflect it upon you and then when he looks across the mirror he looks at you and says my love my dove my undefiled you have calamus and cinnamon and you're thinking really I don't know I had a lot every word that come from the mirror don't you see friends he's letting it shine right upon your face and what he's seeing is himself and a reflected light no wonder he can so my choice truth is there's anything good seen out of me he'll has to have a spell because they sure didn't come from me let me just be honest and say if there's anything good see now to all you all I know most of you pretty good and if there's any good holy and righteous and eternal value see now to most of us it'll have to be Bar glory because it sure didn't come from us but he ain't lying he ain't stretching the truth is not saying something we don't see he's saying what he sees it's on your face your life praise God let us be glad and rejoice and make merry for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready to her was granted that she should be clothed in fine linen clean and white but linen which came from the flax grown on the river now in the land of Egypt Basilius it produced such brilliant white linen that a pound of linen was equal to a pound of gold this is the word that John uses when he says the bride is clothed in this kind of linen so brilliant and so wide praise God don't you love him tenacity it's about his skin if you let him praise God thank you Lord Jesus father as we bow our heads in your presence we ask you tonight Lord that you would help us no doubt I'm speaking father to people in different degrees of their walk with you visible and invisible as well maybe some that need a renewing some that need a refreshing something that's never even given their heart to you others Lord that are truly born again but they need a renewing in their mind not so much that they think about filthy dirty things like that all the time but it's just the things of life the kids the grandkids this that the other their mind is just so filled with so many natural things they're so caught up with the schedule of life that to be here on Monday morning your money evening and your Monday night and here to use and I got a birthday party to go to and then they've got a graduation party to go to and this and that and the other and before they know the week is gone and haven't even prayed read their Bible Lord Jesus all those our hands and views that come in to block the view from the mirror then we look at ourselves and we think Lord I just I just don't feel right Lord I just don't feel like I need to feel help us to not Jesus I don't think there's a one of us in this building that couldn't say that the room for us to move up I say that Lord let it begin with me Lord Jesus help me up pray help each of us father we know that there's not only stages of glory from loser to Wester to Pentecost but they're stages in this message our walk is stages of spiritual growth we know Lord in this chapter after this one here that just after they've got married they haven't been married very long at all until he has to go seeking her and asking her to come back because of a complacency and a coldness that struck her heart what a perfect reflection of the humanity that still left and those of us that are truly born again after being married to Christ the word the human part is still there it'll pull on us every day of our life we believe what your prophet taught father that you'll have a carnal sticking nature as long as you live and it's going to bother you I realize her son to think they're above that but in reality we know better but we are grateful that it does bother us because before we got saved it didn't bother us at all may you be able to go down these howls across these pews cross this platform upstairs Lord in the nurseries in the back and the nurseries and the sound booths on this main level in the ones upstairs the Saints Allen George and Newfoundland China Cyprus South Africa wherever they are in the different parts of the world may the Spirit of God I pray there was their hearts Lord Jesus we love you so much we want to be able to reflect your glory it's not ours they want to be able to keep the mirror clean keep hands out of the way ideas out of the way so the light from your great face can shine upon the mirror and as we look into that it shines back and hits us and the more we look the more were changed the longer we look and look into that image the more would begin to let things go but if we're currently looking at other people looking at other ministers looking at ourselves how great we are our value this this this this will never change from who we are because the image we see we love we look at our flesh and we look at that image and we love that image we will never want that image to change but if we see its shortcomings its failures then we will want that image to be changed we weakly letting this go and that go that the glory of God can shine through we love you tonight father praise God would you just raise your hand to the Lord tonight if you just like for him to know you you want his help that's all you just want his help tonight was wherever you are right now maybe you're not you're in a great mountaintop in your walk with God well praise the lord god bless you in your mountaintop i hate to bring sad news enjoy it while you can because you won't stay there long not in this day valleys come often enough but may god give you the joy you need while you're in that mountain so you can be able to have it when you're in the valley again if you've got health praise god for it but satan will try to attack you but sickness we know that wherever you are tonight may god be able to minister to you and give you the strength the courage the faith whatever you need praise God oh Jesus we magnify your Holy Name tonight Lord we worship You Lord Jesus father it's so sad what a set of all ago with some of these poor people around the message don't even think you're worthy of worship normal because you're like a little boy up in heaven the Prophet destroyed that old Trinitarian doctrine now resurfaces again under another name to Lord still right from the pits of hell that's where it comes from Lord Jesus people don't want to worship you that's up to them my Bible tells me the angels of God worship you so if they do I figure I better hallelujah I worship you tonight Lord Jesus because you're not some little second command in heaven you are the command in heaven you are the mighty God the everlasting father we worship You Lord all we know that thing is rampant going through the message we know what it is it's preachers being anointed with demons right out of hell trying to get people's minds change and conform them prophet toasts said the devil told you there's three gods so he can make a he'd than that of you if the devil told people there's three gods to make a heathen telling them these two makes a heathen out of them as well we don't worship three and we don't worship two we worship one tonight we worship You Lord Jesus we're not ashamed of that blessed name hallelujah glory to God it was by that name we were saved in that glorious name we were baptized in that name that we repented in that name that we are married praise God true and by that name we will
