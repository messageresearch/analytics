[18:03] this man's life but God has done
[18:06] wonderful wonderful wonderful exploits
[18:09] in brother Marcus's life and it's just
[18:12] it has been a long conversation with you

[18:21] lives life and I want you to give him a
[18:24] nice hand he's gonna lead us in a song
[18:25] this morning but the markets come buddy
[18:28] [Applause]
[18:39] so it is now the promise to keep it
[18:46] short as I can't
[18:48] there won't be last night's conversation
[18:54] main reason I'm here outside of just had
[18:57] to see this brother again and the other
[18:59] brother who are you getting back the
[19:01] areas for the lineal there's I'm
[19:06] probably without any doubt the least
[19:09] among us there's one thing I've learned
[19:13] in my life and it's not just by reading
[19:17] the scriptures it's through experience
[19:19] what the power of prayer does you're
[19:23] looking at an individual that short of
[19:26] the prayers answered there's little
[19:30] doubt I wouldn't be here this morning
[19:32] some of you heard years ago my sister
[19:35] that played the organ for 40 years that
[19:38] we had a lot of great times in church
[19:41] singing I lost her lost my brother my
[19:45] mom the most tragic time of my life my
[19:49] son David that worked with me every day
[19:52] barely in the spring of his life we
[19:55] don't know why now other than God's time
[19:58] but I thought about this brother when he
[20:01] sent me word he's praying and I knew he
[20:04] would I knew he would and without
[20:08] getting into it
[20:09] God has answered some prayers or I
[20:10] wouldn't be standing here and I wanted
[20:13] to come to this assembly not because
[20:15] you're infamous and I wanted to see one
[20:17] doc but I wanted to say thank you I
[20:20] don't know if we always stop and look at
[20:24] her brothers and sisters and thank them
[20:25] for the prayers I wouldn't be here
[20:28] without your prayers I'll say this and
[20:32] I'll move on and he asked me about the
[20:35] singing I won't get into the reasons and
[20:38] some discredit to myself it's it's been
[20:41] many many years since I stood up and
[20:43] sang other than at funerals and weddings
[20:46] but it's a passion in my life and I gave
[20:51] me compliments beyond what I deserve so
[20:53] I'm not sure what it'll do today but the
[20:57] first thing I thought about if I seen
[20:59] like I said everybody's gonna join cuz
[21:02] if it croaks I know how to let you drown
[21:05] me out and another reason I chose this
[21:10] song you knows like Markus Falls songs
[21:13] you've seen today I've seen some
[21:14] beautiful that song you opened with was
[21:16] think you picked it for me but I'm gonna
[21:22] take this brief I was blessed to be able
[21:25] to visit the holy land we call it Israel
[21:27] two years ago and I the brother that led
[21:30] the location is that each place that we
[21:33] went to it was I cannot
[21:37] what it was like to listen to that
[21:40] brother
[21:40] stand on the Mount of Olives and deliver
[21:42] a little short sermon talk about the
[21:45] disciples come in that night or he pray
[21:49] and go back and they were asleep he
[21:50] brought it to life stood in the basement
[21:54] of the safest the high priests where
[21:59] we're told Christ meant that last night
[22:00] naked cold walk the streets where he
[22:04] bore that cross and just one thing after
[22:08] another stood at the base of what they
[22:09] call gall Gotha and felt it all come to
[22:13] life so real it was invited to go to a
[22:17] sunrise meeting the next morning that
[22:19] there's 6 a.m. on the banks of the
[22:21] Jordan River and the optics you couldn't
[22:24] have planned it you look out there and
[22:27] there's this ship and just like in the
[22:29] old days it's like they planned it but
[22:31] they didn't there was some fishermen
[22:33] throwing out their nets and I think all
[22:36] of that just build up something so deep
[22:39] in me that I said as simple as this song
[22:43] is we all know it it's one of the
[22:45] reasons but I said someday I'm almost
[22:47] seeing this song again in church because
[22:50] when that brother opened up the song
[22:52] victory in Jesus I tried to explain it
[22:55] last night I have never felt the power
[22:57] of God like I felt I was so
[23:00] engulfed in bawling-crying and i was
[23:03] amongst good denominational brass
[23:05] brethren you know I'm like hiding my
[23:08] face my chest is heaving I couldn't
[23:10] control it and I know that it was a
[23:12] culmination may be psychologically of
[23:15] everything I had witnessed that week but
[23:18] then I set there and it all came back to
[23:20] him I loved the Prophet I loved the
[23:23] ministry but it all came back to him so
[23:27] that's what I want to sing today
[23:31] all of us I heard an old old story I was
[23:39] Sadie came from glory whoa how he gave
[23:43] his life
[23:44] Oh calories just to say
[23:48] [Music]
[23:52] here's gone these precious blood told me
[23:57] would I leave
[24:01] opossums
[24:02] and one told
[24:05] [Music]
[24:09] Oh
[24:09] [Music]
[24:13] - something
[24:17] with his me-tv
[24:25] and all my love
[24:27] this to him for he pumps me to victories
[24:33] and he thought lance and flood

[24:41] cleansing power revealing Lord you made
[24:45] too lame to walk again and he calls the
[24:50] blind to see right here Jesus come and
[24:56] heal my bruised but spirit somehow
[25:04] Thole victory in Jesus I say

[29:37] don't nobody be nervous I'm nervous
[29:39] enough for all of us as I have said
[29:43] before sometimes I tell brother Louie I
[29:45] got a song in my heart and then five
[29:48] minutes later I usually regret ever
[29:50] telling him that this song is kind of
[29:56] it's sounds like an older car song it's
[29:59] called Jesus is calling but I'm glad
[30:02] through my whole life Jesus has been
[30:05] calling and if Jesus has called you one
[30:10] time and you were the bride he's called
[30:14] you a hundred times as brother Danny's
[30:16] been going through the book of Solomon I
[30:18] I know many times in my life spiritually
[30:22] he's looked through the lattice and
[30:23] called my name and when I was cold or
[30:26] half back slid get too busy with things
[30:29] of like everybody and not pray like I
[30:32] should not read like I should and start
[30:33] getting cold on the Lord and I can start
[30:35] hearing call me Harry
[30:37] where are you I need you fellowship so
[30:40] whether you're just beginning or whether
[30:44] you're back slid or whether you're away
[30:46] from the Lord Jesus is calling and if he
[30:49] is calling you you're the richest man in
[30:52] the world
[30:53] you're much richer and Bill Gates if
[30:54] he's ecology anyway
[30:57] [Music]
[30:59] [Applause]
[31:09] how are you hurting and broken within
[31:15] overwhelmed by the weight of your sin
[31:19] Jesus is carving have you come to the
[31:26] end of yourself do you thirst for the
[31:31] dream from the world Jesus is calling or
[31:39] come to the altar the father's arms are

[41:28] friends our nation is you know I love I
[41:31] love our nation now when I was a young
[41:33] boy my mom and daddy actually signed for
[41:35] me to go into the army I was even too
[41:37] young to join myself I had got my
[41:38] parent's signature but I went and I was
[41:41] in the airborne artillery over at Fort
[41:43] Bragg 18th Airborne Corps and you know I
[41:45] wanted to serve my country I wanted to
[41:47] and I'm not an American in my heart you
[41:50] know but it breaks my heart to see the
[41:53] condition that our nation is in this
[41:54] morning
[41:55] it does it breaks my heart but you know
[41:57] we know these kingdoms have to fall
[41:59] these things have to give way because
[42:01] there's coming a kingdom that will not
[42:03] fall you know and really that's the one
[42:06] I really belong to fish and so a man we
[42:09] just kind of such an honor to be here
[42:10] this morning if you have your Bibles
[42:12] turn with us to the book of mark we want
[42:14] to read from mark the chapter 11 this
[42:16] morning starting at verse 12 amen I went
[42:24] to the lapel mic this morning so maybe
[42:25] think maybe it won't fall off
[42:28] I'm not exactly sure how that happened
[42:30] last night but anyway we want to read
[42:33] from mark chapter 11 this morning we
[42:34] greet once again in the name of the Lord
[42:36] Jesus and desire your prayers this week
[42:38] and me and brother Danny and brother
[42:39] Lindsey McGrady are heading down to
[42:41] Nicaragua to Chinon daga for some
[42:43] meetings up so we just desire your
[42:45] prayers we can get in and out safely
[42:48] amen I want to speak to you this morning
[42:51] on breaking the barriers of doubt
[42:54] breaking the barriers of doubt now I
[42:58] want to read this quote just before we
[43:00] read the scriptures and I want you to
[43:01] listen to what brother Branham says says
[43:04] the same thing by divine healing your
[43:06] sick people here this morning believe
[43:08] that and you've been born again and our
[43:11] sons and daughters of God Christ has all
[43:14] ready healed you
[43:17] the only thing that keeps you from being
[43:20] well this morning is a spirit hanging
[43:23] over you that won't fully let you go out
[43:27] yonder and believe God's promises that
[43:30] he's done it that's right now that's my
[43:33] Commission that's what God gave me it's
[43:36] what he gave every gospel preacher who
[43:39] will believe him the power and the
[43:42] authority to break that spirit I believe
[43:47] with all my heart that every demon power
[43:49] that's in here at this minute is already
[43:52] broken I do
[43:54] I believe there's every sick person in
[43:56] here right now feels a lot different if
[43:58] that's right he says raise up your hand
[43:59] you who was sick see there what's the
[44:02] matter the devil has broke away from you
[44:05] he has to faith cometh by hearing and
[44:08] hearing by the word of God
[44:10] Jesus Christ died for you amen Jesus
[44:14] Christ died for you and faith in the
[44:17] Word of God breaks Satan from away from
[44:21] you faith in the Word of God that Jesus
[44:24] died for you
[44:25] if he loved me enough to die for me
[44:26] surely he loves me enough to heal me and
[44:29] faith in the Word of God is what breaks
[44:31] Satan away from you amen
[44:35] breaking barriers now let's read mark
[44:37] chapter 11 verse 12 and on the morrow
[44:41] when they were come from Bethany he was
[44:43] hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off
[44:45] having leaves he came if happily he
[44:48] might find anything their own and when
[44:50] he came to it he found nothing but
[44:52] leaves for the time of the figs was not
[44:54] yet and jesus answered and said unto it
[44:57] no man eateth fruit of the hereafter
[45:00] forever and his disciples heard it and
[45:03] in the morning as they passed by they
[45:05] saw the fig tree dried up from the roots
[45:08] and Peter calling to remembrance said
[45:12] unto him master
[45:13] behold the fig tree which thou curses is
[45:16] withered away and jesus answered and
[45:19] said unto Him have faith in God
[45:24] for verily I say unto you that whoever
[45:26] who whosoever shall say unto this
[45:29] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[45:30] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[45:34] his heart but shall believe that those
[45:36] things which he saith shall come to pass
[45:38] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[45:42] therefore I say unto you what things
[45:44] soever you desire when you pray believe
[45:46] that you receive them and ye shall have
[45:51] them it's the word of the Lord
[45:54] and when you stand praying forgive if
[45:58] you have any old against any that your
[46:01] father also which is in heaven may
[46:03] forgive you in your trespasses now why
[46:06] does he go from talking about all things
[46:08] are possible how faith in God why does
[46:11] he tie in this scripture on forgiveness
[46:13] why does he turn to that and start
[46:15] talking about forgiveness
[46:16] because we know that faith is based on
[46:20] forgiveness
[46:21] amen faith is based on forgiveness let's
[46:26] bow our heads this morning breaking
[46:28] barriers Heavenly Father thy word is
[46:33] true in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we
[46:39] look to you this morning
[46:41] thou who has placed the Holy Spirit
[46:44] within our hearts that it may lead us
[46:45] and guide us Lord may we less not ever
[46:49] wait Lord ever thought every barrier
[46:52] that Satan were trying to hinder us with
[46:54] this boredom and simply take you at your
[46:56] word Lord and father may they be great
[47:00] testimonies because you visited among us
[47:03] as our brother saying truly Lord there
[47:07] is victory in Jesus other be mindful of
[47:11] the folks down in Florida today we pray
[47:13] Lord as we just heard coming up the road
[47:16] over a million already's lost power
[47:18] father just be merciful to him we ask
[47:21] Lord as we commit these things into your
[47:23] hands for your glory and the Saints said
[47:26] god bless you may be seated this morning
[47:28] now in our scripture reading we find
[47:31] that our Lord was hungry and finding no
[47:35] FIGS on this tree he cursed it that it
[47:38] would never bear figs again but I want
[47:42] you to notice he never made a public
[47:43] show out of it he never said all right
[47:45] now everybody stop I'm fixing to do
[47:47] something and I'm fixing to speak I want
[47:49] everybody to hear what I'm going he
[47:50] never done that but just in passing he
[47:53] made a statement and Peter heard it and
[47:56] Peter hearing this the next morning when
[47:59] they were passing by Peter sees that the
[48:01] tree is starting to wither from the
[48:03] roots and he remarks to Jesus and he
[48:07] says look the tree is dried up you see
[48:11] Peter seen that the tree was dying and
[48:14] it broke to his remembrance that the
[48:17] Lord had cursed it and he says look look
[48:21] Lord the tree is dying what you said is
[48:24] happening aim ahead and Jesus turns to
[48:30] Peter and says have faith in God
[48:34] for verily I say unto you that
[48:36] whatsoever you shall say unto this
[48:39] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[48:41] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[48:44] his heart but shall believe that those
[48:46] things which he said shall come to pass
[48:49] he shall have whatsoever he saith amen
[48:54] but then we know it's got to be it's not
[48:56] just how personally asked him whatever
[48:57] comes to your mind
[48:58] but it's according to the will of God
[49:02] amen
[49:04] but if you said in your heart and don't
[49:06] doubt in his heart
[49:08] now doubt means to be uncertain about
[49:11] something to believe that something may
[49:14] not be true or that it's unlikely to be
[49:19] undecided to tend to distrust to
[49:23] disbelieve now when most of us think of
[49:27] doubt we think of that part of the
[49:29] definition that something may not be
[49:31] true or simply we don't believe it
[49:35] so as believers we think along these
[49:38] lines I'm not an unbeliever
[49:40] because I believe all things are
[49:44] possible
[49:45] how many believes that this one sure we
[49:47] believe all things are possible so we as
[49:50] a believer you say you know and I'm not
[49:52] trying to hinder your faith nor am I
[49:54] trying to make you an unbeliever but I
[49:56] want to make a point here I believe that
[49:59] we're believers and we get in the mind
[50:00] I'm a believer because I don't
[50:03] disbelieve it I don't distrust it but
[50:06] there's a part of the definition of
[50:08] doubt that I want us to look at just for
[50:10] a minute and that's part that says that
[50:12] it's unlikely or undecided because I
[50:16] think that's where many times we find
[50:18] ourselves yes we believe God's more than
[50:21] able to do anything but we have this
[50:25] barrier this barrier of doubt that hangs
[50:28] over us that hangs just above us that
[50:30] tells us it's unlikely that it'll happen
[50:34] to you or we're undecided
[50:37] yes gods a healer but will God heal me
[50:41] gods are delivered yes I believe God to
[50:44] deliver all things are possible
[50:47] but will God deliver me you say how many
[50:52] please there's a bride the church will
[50:54] raise their hands
[50:54] happy believes you're a part of it you
[50:56] don't get as many hands amen yes God's a
[51:03] healer
[51:04] none of us here this morning doubts that
[51:06] but Satan places over us a barrier will
[51:11] he heal me my brother Brenda said a
[51:13] spirit hanging over you that you won't
[51:15] fully let you go out yonder and believe
[51:18] God's promises he said brother what are
[51:22] you talking about let me give you an
[51:23] example in the Bible of Mark chapter 9
[51:25] verse 23 and 24 jesus said unto him now
[51:28] this man had a boy that had epilepsy and
[51:31] he fell into the fire and all these
[51:32] things and jesus said unto him if thou
[51:35] can believe o things are possible to him
[51:39] that believes and straightway the father
[51:42] of the child he cried out and said with
[51:45] tears lord I believe but help thou my
[51:51] unbelief
[51:53] [Applause]
[51:58] amen
[51:59] but jesus said i say unto you whatsoever
[52:01] things you desire when you pray believe
[52:03] that you receive them and ye shall have
[52:07] them now friends that's just as much the
[52:10] Word of God as let there be light
[52:14] that's true that's just we have no doubt
[52:17] nobody ever questions let there be light
[52:18] you know why we see it every day but
[52:25] when he said this right here whatever
[52:26] you desire your if you pray and don't
[52:28] doubt you can have what you ask for
[52:30] that's just as much the Word of God and
[52:35] every word of God is only as true as
[52:38] every one of God if let there be light
[52:41] is true then this is true if there's a
[52:45] true let there be lighting through
[52:46] because what thank God don't do God
[52:49] don't lie you see faith cometh by
[52:55] hearing now hearing is not faith hearing
[53:02] is not faith many people here and never
[53:05] have faith hearing is not faith but
[53:07] hearing comes or faith comes by hearing
[53:11] fake comes by hearing here is not faith
[53:15] but faith comes by hearing and hearing
[53:17] by the Word of God when you trust in
[53:19] what the word is saying to you see the
[53:23] word has got to be come to you personal
[53:25] it's got to be a personal revelation
[53:27] because what is faith faith is a
[53:30] revelation it's something that's
[53:32] revealed to you that's not yet but you
[53:35] believe it will be faith don't look at
[53:38] what it sees with its eye faith looks to
[53:41] the unseen faith is a revelation of the
[53:46] will of God faith is such a deep subject
[53:51] it's so mystical to us and yet it's so
[53:59] simple and I wonder sometimes if it's
[54:02] not so simple that we stagger over it
[54:06] [Applause]
[54:09] but as I said I see people come through
[54:11] the line and they say oh I have faith to
[54:14] be healed and bereave said friends when
[54:18] they passed by I know they haven't got
[54:20] enough faith for it to cure a toothache
[54:21] and some of them coming through with
[54:24] cancer and say I have faith to be healed
[54:26] and they do not have faith even though
[54:31] they say it they do not have faith they
[54:37] have hope hope is faith enemy but faith
[54:44] is the substance of things hoped for and
[54:46] the evidence of things not seen
[54:48] it's a substance it's something that's
[54:51] direct it's something that you really
[54:54] have not something that you imagine not
[54:56] something that you think you have it's a
[54:58] direct positive act that you have people
[55:04] many people have hope instead of faith
[55:07] and yet faith is so simple the only
[55:10] thing you have to know is that Jesus
[55:15] died to save sinners and his blood
[55:17] washes us why the snow that's all you
[55:21] need to know God how simple can that be
[55:25] I was a sinner he died for me he washed
[55:29] me with his blood now I'm a son of God
[55:32] and every diptych blessing belongs to me
[55:36] it's just that simple it's not something
[55:39] tango it's not if I hold my hands right
[55:42] if I can pray on enough if I could pray
[55:44] loud enough we do that but that's not
[55:46] what Desi Ghee it's that simple
[55:53] child like faith then he said it I
[55:58] believe it that settles it
[56:02] you see when Jessica was blind the
[56:05] doctors gave us no encouragement none
[56:10] mr. Ward if you'll do this and mr.
[56:12] Warner I think we can do this and she'll
[56:14] be all right
[56:15] they never said that they never gave us
[56:17] a choice of surgery they never gave us a
[56:19] choice of therapy they never gave us a
[56:22] choice all they said was we're sorry so
[56:30] Shirley and I went to the Bible because
[56:35] if they didn't have the answer Jesus did
[56:38] [Applause]
[56:41] but do you believe in doctors yes I used
[56:44] to work with doctors I have nothing
[56:46] against them but when they can't help us
[56:48] Jesus can someone told me the logo I
[56:54] don't believe Jesus Hills no more I said
[56:56] you come too late to tell me I see it
[57:01] every day of my life I see a name and
[57:05] not only do I see it she sees it
[57:09] hallelujah we went to the Bible we
[57:15] started quoting Isaiah 53 we started
[57:19] telling Jessica you'll see me again
[57:22] you'll see me again let's say do you see
[57:25] me no daddy I don't see you know what
[57:28] that was
[57:29] barriers yes God heals blinded eyes did
[57:36] I know that I preached it for years I
[57:38] preached for years God opens blinded us
[57:43] but what about hers
[57:48] is that Alright this morning what about
[57:54] hers because you see brother Charlie the
[57:56] devil come to tell me yeah God opens
[57:57] blinded eyes but really her eyes will
[57:59] not blind God who was blinded eyes but
[58:03] really there's nothing wrong with her
[58:05] eye there's nothing wrong with her nerve
[58:07] you see her problem wasn't really her
[58:09] eye her problem wasn't really her nerve
[58:11] her problem was her brain the brain was
[58:14] so damaged it could not process the
[58:17] information so he said you have God
[58:20] opens blinded eyes this is what I bought
[58:22] this was the barriers these were the
[58:24] hindrances that Satan tried to use yes
[58:28] God heals yes God opens blinded eyes but
[58:31] her eyes are really not blind
[58:33] so that really don't apply to her what
[58:35] was it barriers hindrances but we had to
[58:44] break through those barriers
[58:46] what was the Satan's barriers but she
[58:50] believed me she was just a little girl
[58:55] but she believed me and let me be honest
[58:59] with you this morning when she started
[59:01] believing me it wasn't her it wasn't me
[59:06] helping her it was her helping me
[59:10] because for the last her faith in
[59:12] believing in igniting my faith do you
[59:18] understand what I'm saying when she
[59:20] started agreeing with the word it helped
[59:22] me to agree with the word food one can
[59:28] put a thousand the flight do can put ten
[59:31] thousand amen amen
[59:34] [Applause]
[59:37] she started believing me I'll see you
[59:41] again because daddy said I'd see again
[59:42] that simple child like faith
[59:48] you see she didn't understand the
[59:49] barriers she didn't understand the
[59:52] x-rays in the MRIs she just a little
[59:54] girl she didn't understand that so I'll
[59:56] see new to believe was what daddy said
[59:59] and I think a lot of times how much
[1:00:01] better off we would believe if all we
[1:00:03] understood was what daddy said you're
[1:00:12] sick you see the working of the Holy
[1:00:13] Spirit stick oh if I can just get
[1:00:15] brother Jones to pray for me and have
[1:00:17] more faith people come up for prayer all
[1:00:19] the time I pray for hundreds of
[1:00:21] thousands of people a year we pray for
[1:00:23] people coming in prayer lines people
[1:00:24] coming up for prayer and lots of
[1:00:26] civility I'll pray that I'll have more
[1:00:27] faith and you try to get them to
[1:00:29] understand you've already got it you've
[1:00:33] already got it it's just that simple ice
[1:00:36] up we'd the same fate that brought you
[1:00:39] to the meeting this morning or planting
[1:00:43] any promise of God will bring it to pass
[1:00:45] in your life did anybody get up this
[1:00:50] morning to go through their house and
[1:00:52] look at the vase on the wall and look at
[1:00:54] the coffeepot and say you know this may
[1:00:56] be the last time I ever see this I want
[1:00:58] to get a good look at my house cuz I
[1:00:59] don't know if I'll be back a lot we
[1:01:01] don't do that when we go to the store we
[1:01:03] don't hugger laugh like it's the last
[1:01:05] time that we'll ever see her again we
[1:01:07] just kiss or say honey I'll be back in a
[1:01:09] minute I'm gonna go get some taters or
[1:01:10] something like that that's what we do
[1:01:12] you know why it's an unconscious faith
[1:01:14] we've done it so many times we don't
[1:01:16] even think about it I'm going to the
[1:01:18] store and I'm coming back and that's the
[1:01:20] way it ought to be with the Word of God
[1:01:21] God said it God's brooding it should not
[1:01:24] even be a second doubt it should not
[1:01:26] even be a second thought God said it and
[1:01:28] that's gonna happen because God said it
[1:01:30] would happen
[1:01:31] [Applause]
[1:01:36] amen
[1:01:37] it's just a simple childlike faith to
[1:01:40] apply the blood to believe it with all
[1:01:43] your heart and it'll happen you know you
[1:01:46] know he ever said you know what Jesus
[1:01:47] all Jesus ever said was do you believe
[1:01:51] only believe
[1:01:56] not only believe plus a goose but not
[1:01:59] only believe plus a vision come on
[1:02:01] somebody none of you believe by seeing a
[1:02:04] pillar of fire hanging over the platform
[1:02:06] no he never said that the goose-bumpy
[1:02:10] field may not be from God it may be from
[1:02:12] the air-conditioner so we don't base it
[1:02:14] on goosebumps we don't base it on
[1:02:16] sensations we base it on the Word of God
[1:02:19] [Applause]
[1:02:20] it's just simple you know sometimes I
[1:02:23] think we get too smart sometimes I think
[1:02:26] we get too educated but they asked an
[1:02:29] old country boy just a little country
[1:02:31] farmer just an old fella said sir I want
[1:02:33] to ask you a question why do you believe
[1:02:35] why are you a believer you know what he
[1:02:38] said because I believe is that when we
[1:02:42] understand that sir we know that you
[1:02:44] believe what I'm trying to find out sir
[1:02:46] is why do you believe he said because
[1:02:49] I'm a believer yes sir yes sir listen to
[1:02:55] me mr. Jones listen I know you're a
[1:02:58] believer but what I want to try to find
[1:03:00] out is why are you a believer oh that's
[1:03:03] easy because I believe you see if we
[1:03:10] wasn't believers they would probably
[1:03:12] call us something else
[1:03:19] hallelujah you see I'm not saved this
[1:03:22] morning because I got down to an altar
[1:03:23] and cried
[1:03:26] I've made a few years ago up the camp up
[1:03:28] in Ohio at the youth camp my brother had
[1:03:29] a testimony service around the bonfire
[1:03:31] that night and the kids were testifying
[1:03:33] and some of them said I was sitting
[1:03:34] listening to him
[1:03:35] some of them said oh ha say when when
[1:03:37] that certain brother out there I
[1:03:37] preached that message home I spoke to my
[1:03:39] heart and I begin to shout and I know I
[1:03:41] got it
[1:03:42] nothing it's wrong answer they're basing
[1:03:50] their religious experience because they
[1:03:51] shouted the others gonna appreciate I
[1:03:57] tell you I got down at that altar and
[1:03:59] that word was so real and I thought God
[1:04:00] I know you're talking to me god I know
[1:04:02] this words for me and I just received it
[1:04:04] and I got so happy I got the shouting of
[1:04:06] it being that's the answer
[1:04:11] believers don't follow signs and wonders
[1:04:14] but signs and wonders do follow
[1:04:15] believers so we're not saved because I
[1:04:19] got down an altar in Christ I'm not
[1:04:20] saying because something touched my
[1:04:22] heart and made me cry but I'm saying
[1:04:24] because I meant God's Word I met the
[1:04:27] requirements of God's Word you see Satan
[1:04:29] can whip us around our emotions sank
[1:04:31] your weapons around on how we feel
[1:04:32] because some day we fell out we can
[1:04:34] conquer the world
[1:04:35] the next day we don't want to get out of
[1:04:37] bed but saint can whip us around on our
[1:04:42] feelings that's why some people that
[1:04:44] when they're come to when they're old
[1:04:45] fire for God they never miss a service
[1:04:47] but the first time something goes wrong
[1:04:50] they can't hardly make it to church and
[1:04:52] when they do they set my brother duo
[1:04:54] rosie-wosie me you said brother now you
[1:04:56] don't understand I'm going through a
[1:04:58] hard time I'm not belittling what you're
[1:04:59] going through with friends we all go
[1:05:01] through hard times I've lost loved ones
[1:05:02] I've buried my mom I've buried my daddy
[1:05:04] I buried my brother I buried my
[1:05:06] father-in-law I buried my sister I've
[1:05:08] done those things I know it hurts but
[1:05:09] one thing I do know the pain is never
[1:05:12] greater than my god
[1:05:14] oh yeah no matter what I go through it's
[1:05:18] not greater than God's ability to change
[1:05:21] my lives hey man boy to God I feel like
[1:05:28] speaking Cherokee how you can interpret
[1:05:35] revelation
[1:05:38] amen it meant but I'm saved because God
[1:05:42] said so accept him on the basis of his
[1:05:45] word
[1:05:45] that's how I'm saved because I believe
[1:05:48] it and I confess what the word says and
[1:05:53] it brings the results of the word I'm
[1:05:55] saved because we're God's Word teaches
[1:05:58] that I'm saved because I met the
[1:06:00] requirements of God's Word that's how
[1:06:03] you're saved if you're saved this
[1:06:04] morning Satan can whip us on our ideals
[1:06:07] Satan can whip us on things but he can't
[1:06:09] go around the Word of God
[1:06:12] jesus said it's written and that settles
[1:06:15] it with all of it it is written in the
[1:06:18] word then I'm saved not because I feel
[1:06:21] like it but because I met God's
[1:06:22] requirements and that same principle
[1:06:24] applies to healing I'm not healed
[1:06:26] because I feel like I'm not healed
[1:06:28] because I got a goose bump I'm not here
[1:06:30] because somebody screamed when somebody
[1:06:31] pray with somebody pray for me somebody
[1:06:33] screamed and that's the evidence I know
[1:06:35] sir
[1:06:35] that's not what it is it's the same
[1:06:37] principle we accept God on the basis of
[1:06:40] his word he is my healer here's my
[1:06:42] deliverer and Christ alone I stand amen
[1:06:52] then I'm healed because God teaches me
[1:06:54] that I'm healed you see in order to have
[1:06:58] faith faith let's have a basis you can't
[1:07:01] just let faith be loosen around faith
[1:07:04] has to rest itself upon something not
[1:07:07] the shifting sands of man's reason it's
[1:07:09] not up one day and down the next faith
[1:07:11] can never anchor there but faith is
[1:07:14] based on the solid rock of God's Word
[1:07:16] faith rest right Oh God's words
[1:07:21] God said it that settles it it don't
[1:07:23] shift things don't shift from that men
[1:07:26] sometimes they can paint a picture so
[1:07:28] real doctors can paint the picture so
[1:07:31] real MRIs CT scans can make the picture
[1:07:35] look so real
[1:07:36] you'll get a lump in your throat trust
[1:07:40] me I know I can make it look so real
[1:07:45] but faith will never look at that if
[1:07:52] it's contrary to God's Word if it's
[1:07:54] contrary to God's Word
[1:07:56] thank don't see them they don't see you
[1:08:05] know the doctors they thought I'd lost
[1:08:06] my mind and I did I had the mind of
[1:08:09] Christ and so sort of watch Jessica when
[1:08:13] I and I went down to this panel of
[1:08:14] doctors and they were sitting there in a
[1:08:16] table across from me I was on this side
[1:08:18] the rest of them was on that side all
[1:08:20] their pens in their pocket and their
[1:08:21] stethoscopes around their neck and their
[1:08:23] white coats and I said mr. Ward were a
[1:08:26] little concerned about you said we don't
[1:08:32] think that you're we don't think that
[1:08:33] you're that you're that you're grasping
[1:08:35] the situation we don't think you fully
[1:08:37] understand the Cygnus that the the
[1:08:40] extent of your daughter's injuries we
[1:08:44] don't think you you know we don't think
[1:08:46] that you realize the seriousness of what
[1:08:49] you're facing and we're just a little
[1:08:51] bit concerned I said what are you
[1:08:56] expecting mixed outcome of your
[1:08:58] daughter's case what do you expect I
[1:09:02] said sir I don't care my daughter's
[1:09:05] present in the United States I'm not
[1:09:07] interested in it she flies the jet plane
[1:09:10] she flies the jet plane but I'm not
[1:09:12] interested in that that's not what I'm
[1:09:14] looking for that's not I said what do
[1:09:17] you want I said just for her to be
[1:09:19] normal
[1:09:22] just to be made the way God made a man
[1:09:31] faithful look at those things they said
[1:09:35] I just want to ask you sir when she's
[1:09:37] because she's just a little girl you
[1:09:39] know she had just not long before had
[1:09:40] been potty-trained she's almost three
[1:09:42] year old and you know and I said sir
[1:09:44] I just want to ask you do you think when
[1:09:46] she comes out of a coma do you think
[1:09:47] she'd still be potty trained or will we
[1:09:49] have to read potty trainer and I'll
[1:09:51] never forget he looked at me like I was
[1:09:52] an idiot
[1:09:53] I just heard crickets you know I said
[1:10:01] mr. Ward that's the least of your
[1:10:03] problems
[1:10:03] that's what I was just wondering
[1:10:10] but when she came out of the coma guess
[1:10:13] what we never had the potty trainer
[1:10:15] again and I believe God honored my faith
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:24] faith will track will track right
[1:10:26] straight back to God's Word that's where
[1:10:28] faith and acres of what God said he said
[1:10:32] it I'm the Lord that healeth thee we
[1:10:35] believe that from God because God said
[1:10:37] it and we believe it and it brings the
[1:10:41] results then if these principles of
[1:10:43] God's Word is true why can't we be
[1:10:46] healed God wants us to have it God's
[1:10:52] done gave it to us I don't think he's an
[1:10:55] Indian giver I don't think God gives it
[1:10:57] to us and it takes it back away from us
[1:10:59] so if God gave it to us I'm not too
[1:11:01] smart but if God gave it to us he must
[1:11:05] have wanted us to have it or brother
[1:11:09] Charlie he wouldn't gave it to us huh he
[1:11:13] wants us to have it the Prophet said
[1:11:16] that God wants to heal you think of this
[1:11:18] quote right here God wants to heal you a
[1:11:21] thousand times more then you want to be
[1:11:25] healed then why is there such a struggle
[1:11:33] it's because of Satan's barriers it's
[1:11:39] Satan's barriers of doubt that little
[1:11:41] spirit that hangs right above you but I
[1:11:45] said it's just that one thing above you
[1:11:48] that little thin shadow of doubt I said
[1:11:52] if you can ever break through that said
[1:11:55] they tell me a great airplane they tell
[1:11:57] me these jet planes that they struggling
[1:11:58] Windell and struggling wiggle till they
[1:12:00] get through the sound barrier but after
[1:12:03] they break that sound barrier they are
[1:12:07] free I would have lied and that YouTube
[1:12:13] pull it up sometime and look at it's
[1:12:14] amazing I looked at some pictures
[1:12:16] brother I know using the Air Force I
[1:12:17] looked at some pictures of planes
[1:12:19] breaking the sound barrier and they was
[1:12:21] coming through there it was almost like
[1:12:22] a hindrance and all of a sudden a big
[1:12:24] white cloud come around them and boom
[1:12:27] and when that thing exploded they were
[1:12:30] gone and that's the way it is with that
[1:12:33] damn barrier once we break through it
[1:12:36] goes 50 miles of elbow room it's
[1:12:38] unlimited it's unlimited to what we can
[1:12:41] do amen your speed is unlimited
[1:12:50] you will receive the manifestation of
[1:12:54] what God's already said because God's
[1:12:57] already said you're healed
[1:13:02] breaking Satan's barriers of doubt see
[1:13:09] Satan's desire is to build barriers of
[1:13:12] doubts around you because he doesn't
[1:13:15] want you to catch the revelation of the
[1:13:18] Word of God for your day you see there's
[1:13:21] two books that Satan hates we know this
[1:13:22] two books Satan hates more than any
[1:13:24] other books in the Bible that's Genesis
[1:13:26] and revelation because Genesis tells
[1:13:28] this beginning Revelation tells his end
[1:13:30] this ain't no like that so if you want
[1:13:33] to upset Satan if you really want to
[1:13:35] obsess upset Satan don't say what he
[1:13:38] wants you to say say what revelation
[1:13:40] says if Satan hates the book of
[1:13:47] Revelation because it tells him where
[1:13:48] he's going and I think we ought to tell
[1:13:51] him every day where he's going
[1:13:56] [Applause]
[1:13:59] Satan hates the book of Revelation he
[1:14:03] knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:14:05] yesterday today and forever Satan knows
[1:14:09] uh certainly that the original trenchant
[1:14:11] in accost with the power of God March 16
[1:14:14] in action is the only true church that
[1:14:16] Jesus claims as his own all else is
[1:14:20] false for Christ in the true church is a
[1:14:23] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:14:29] book of revelations exposes him exposed
[1:14:32] to Satan revealing his works the
[1:14:34] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:14:35] the discrediting of God's Word because
[1:14:41] he knows if you get the true revelation
[1:14:44] of the true church and what she is and
[1:14:46] what she stands for you will be an
[1:14:49] invincible army and Satan will be
[1:14:52] powerless before you so then what is
[1:14:55] Satan's desire Satan wants to hinder you
[1:14:57] from realizing who you are
[1:15:01] safety wants to beat you down that you
[1:15:04] can't even say Amen when the word priest
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:10] Satan's number one job his desire is to
[1:15:14] keep you from recognizing the promise of
[1:15:16] the word for you to keep you away from
[1:15:22] revelation because he knows as you get
[1:15:25] that revelation
[1:15:27] he's whooped it would be so good if we
[1:15:32] knew what the devil knows because he
[1:15:36] knows that but he tries to lie to you to
[1:15:39] keep you from knowing that because he
[1:15:44] knows if you see the word if he knows
[1:15:46] you see the word that's promised to you
[1:15:47] if he knows that you see in James which
[1:15:49] says the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:15:50] righteous man availeth he knows if you
[1:15:52] catch that revelation that that's you
[1:15:54] then he knows when you pray something's
[1:15:56] got to happen because the God's Word
[1:15:57] don't lie the reason sometimes have a
[1:16:01] struggle with that scripture out there
[1:16:02] is because the devil tells us that's
[1:16:04] brother Donnie
[1:16:05] well that's brother Branham well that's
[1:16:06] brother horn it's everybody in the
[1:16:08] church with you but why don't you
[1:16:09] realize he's telling the person beside
[1:16:11] you the same thing what is it his
[1:16:13] lectures
[1:16:14] what is it barriers the devil trying to
[1:16:16] get you from realizing who you are in
[1:16:18] the world and if we never know who we
[1:16:20] are we'll never have the right kind of
[1:16:21] faith how does he do it
[1:16:28] by barriers barriers amen you know what
[1:16:35] a barrier is it's a fence an obstacle
[1:16:37] that prevents movement or access it's
[1:16:42] rylynn it's a barricade it's a hurdle
[1:16:43] it's a bar it's a block it's a roadblock
[1:16:47] the barrier is something that's placed
[1:16:50] across an entrance okay a circumstance
[1:16:54] or an obstacle that keeps people or
[1:16:56] things apart prevents communication or
[1:16:58] progress barrier Beier is an obstacle an
[1:17:02] obstruction a hurdle a stumbling block a
[1:17:06] bar a block an impingement a hindrance
[1:17:10] a curve don't you see what Satan uses
[1:17:15] everything because when Satan sees a
[1:17:22] real move of God gets started in the
[1:17:24] church when Satan sees a real move of
[1:17:25] God get started in your life he'll do
[1:17:27] he'll put everything everything he can
[1:17:30] do to cause the hindrance to put a
[1:17:31] hindrance in your way they're trying to
[1:17:33] keep you from the promise that's
[1:17:35] revealed that the healing the revelation
[1:17:37] the healing the peace to keep you from
[1:17:39] obtaining these things he will throw
[1:17:41] everything in your path to hinder you
[1:17:43] from receiving the blessings of God in
[1:17:46] your life the redemptive blessings that
[1:17:49] belong to us you see it's not something
[1:17:51] that we're going to get someday
[1:17:52] I don't need it someday I need it today
[1:17:56] the people down in Florida they don't
[1:17:59] need a god of tomorrow they need a God
[1:18:01] of right now like a little boy in the
[1:18:07] storm when he was scared said the father
[1:18:08] said son Junior do the Donald take care
[1:18:11] as he said my momma I want a God with
[1:18:13] skin only amen Satan will clutter your
[1:18:21] path to victory with feelings emotions
[1:18:24] symptoms lies confusion education all
[1:18:29] hindrances even the kitchen sink he'll
[1:18:34] even throw that out there if he thinks
[1:18:35] it'll work he throws it all at you Satan
[1:18:41] throws everything in your way that he
[1:18:45] can
[1:18:48] what is it barriers barriers of doubt
[1:18:55] see we don't have to have a great
[1:18:57] education to know God
[1:18:58] matter of fact God's not known by
[1:19:00] education heads and I've got nothing
[1:19:02] against education we should go to school
[1:19:03] you have to work you have to know these
[1:19:04] things you have to give seizures what
[1:19:06] seizures but we'll never know God
[1:19:08] through some kind of MC equals three
[1:19:10] rule of some kind of slide rule you'll
[1:19:11] never know God man education God is
[1:19:14] known by faith when Jessica first got
[1:19:16] her go to God I tried to go to God and

[1:19:57] find God there's nothing going to stop
[1:20:00] them but here's the good thing about
[1:20:08] that Satan knows I want you to
[1:20:10] understand this morning October Michael
[1:20:13] last night I would preach a message one
[1:20:14] day on what Satan knows but Satan knows
[1:20:16] that he can't really stop you
[1:20:21] he knows that oh god oh yeah this
[1:20:25] morning well brother I thought the devil
[1:20:27] all wake up but he's a bluff he can't

[1:20:32] convince you is that he can but he can't
[1:20:35] he knows he can't oh god help us this
[1:20:39] martyr to know and we struggle I know
[1:20:48] you struggle because I struggle we're
[1:20:50] humans sometimes we struggle and we're
[1:20:53] ass when we struggle why it's because of
[1:20:55] Satan's hindrances
[1:20:56] it's his barriers God's pulling you
[1:20:58] God's pulling to you God's showing you
[1:21:00] things if God can just get you past that
[1:21:03] barrier that barrier of unbelief then
[1:21:06] revival will break out through United
[1:21:09] States and everywhere he said if you can
[1:21:12] go beyond the sound barrier that sin
[1:21:14] barrier of them belief breaking the
[1:21:18] barriers of doubt when Satan says yeah
[1:21:24] God heals but he won't heal you
[1:21:25] yeah God loves or he don't love you if
[1:21:27] God loves you you wouldn't be going

[1:21:43] push beyond there is the word talking to
[1:21:45] me yes has God my healer yes it's not my
[1:21:47] deliverer yes if we can look to that
[1:21:49] friends if we can keep our eyes on that
[1:21:51] and push back the barriers and struggle
[1:21:53] to break through those things those
[1:21:55] voices that speaks to you that voice
[1:21:57] that says you'll never get well that
[1:21:58] voice that tells you that cancer is

[1:22:04] gonna bring you that voice that tells
[1:22:06] you you don't have the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:08] you're not going to if you can break
[1:22:09] that barrier it's unlimited
[1:22:12] a man breaking the barriers of doubt is
[1:22:22] it true does it mean me can I be healed
[1:22:25] could I be safe could God fill me with
[1:22:27] the Holy Spirit that Satan bears just to
[1:22:30] get you to doubt that but break that
[1:22:34] barrier just keep struggling like that

[1:22:43] looking to that I'm not seeing that I'm
[1:22:45] not accepting that come on somebody it
[1:22:47] when Satan brings the barriers we need
[1:22:49] to push them back that's not what the
[1:22:51] word says that's not what the word
[1:22:52] chance the word doesn't say you might
[1:22:54] receive the Holy Ghost the word says you
[1:22:56] shall receive the Holy Ghost and we need
[1:23:01] to break those things off of our life

[1:23:36] behind a deer there's 50 miles available
[1:23:40] River just died out to everything just
[1:23:45] died out to the voices I'm not going to
[1:23:47] hear that barrier I'm not gonna believe
[1:23:50] that barrier I'm not going to push that
[1:23:53] out of my mind I'm not going to look at
[1:23:56] that I'm not gonna listen to reason and
[1:24:01] we look at the promise I want to quote
[1:24:04] his word I'm gonna rest on the promise
[1:24:06] I'm gonna like I told Christine over a
[1:24:10] mound in Rome in Romania that had the
[1:24:12] hill problem and I told her I said she
[1:24:14] said brother down I want God to heal my
[1:24:15] hips she said I want to be I want to
[1:24:17] have children I want who would marry me
[1:24:19] like this I said listen to me says if I
[1:24:21] was you I quit asking God for my healing
[1:24:22] and I start accepting I said you take
[1:24:24] this prayer cloth you put it under your
[1:24:25] pillow and when God heals your help you
[1:24:27] send it back to me I said you get up in
[1:24:29] the morning you say thank God for
[1:24:30] healing me when you go to bed and not
[1:24:31] you say thank God for healing me when
[1:24:33] you go to search service you say thank
[1:24:34] God for healing me and I said it when
[1:24:36] God heals you you send that handkerchief
[1:24:37] back to me as a testimony of what God
[1:24:39] did for you
[1:24:40] years went by and I got a brother here
[1:24:42] in the church came up been in the chat

[1:24:54] oh no here she goes again said but I
[1:24:56] kept on testifying my mom and daddy said
[1:24:58] you need to stop because you know you're
[1:24:59] not any better and you're bringing the
[1:25:01] reproach me she said I didn't listen to
[1:25:02] him brother down I kept testified and
[1:25:04] she said I was in church I said I stood
[1:25:06] up with that crutch and I said I want to
[1:25:08] thank God for healing me he said brother
[1:25:10] Darrell I felt a pop I felt a pop in my
[1:25:13] hip and when I did I threw down the foot
[1:25:16] then I walked out of church why break up
[1:25:19] the barriers of doubt break through the
[1:25:20] barriers you'll never be no better
[1:25:22] you've had this for years you've had
[1:25:24] this for years but congressman Upshaw
[1:25:26] have at 66 years
[1:25:28] 66 years in a wheelchair but God's it's
[1:25:31] tangible
[1:25:35] hey hey we've got to come past the birds
[1:25:45] until you break the barrier you'll never
[1:25:47] do no good it's not God was well God did
[1:25:53] those things in 65 when brother Brennan
[1:25:55] was here if God never done it once God
[1:25:57] still does it well God was God then but
[1:26:02] he isn't down it's a sin that's a singer
[1:26:04] that's a doubt bear come on that Satan's
[1:26:07] burger it's just a lie he's still gone
[1:26:09] if he ever was God he's still God is
[1:26:11] even the same God today then he never
[1:26:13] was God he said I am God and I changed
[1:26:17] not it's not God's lost his power God
[1:26:23] has not lost his power he's the same God
[1:26:26] he always was God's not lost his power
[1:26:30] man has lost his faith
[1:26:34] it's not god it's man it's man just went
[1:26:38] back on the promise to believe a man ohh
[1:26:43] I managed to get a few weeks off the
[1:26:49] rest I feel good a man breaking barriers
[1:26:57] you know there was a time that they said
[1:27:00] that man could not run a four-minute
[1:27:01] mile they said if man would run a
[1:27:05] four-minute mile II was bust his heart
[1:27:07] his lungs would break his muscles would
[1:27:10] ripped from his legs
[1:27:12] medical science experts missed thousands
[1:27:16] of years they said man's tried to break
[1:27:18] the four-minute mile experts said it
[1:27:23] couldn't be done they even put Bulls
[1:27:26] behind people and had the Bulls to
[1:27:28] chasing them to see if they could run
[1:27:30] faster
[1:27:32] [Applause]
[1:27:36] you can't make that up I pity potato
[1:27:42] right now they put a ball behind me I
[1:27:43] might break the four-minute mile they
[1:27:53] said the body shot said the human body
[1:27:57] was incapable of breaking the
[1:28:01] four-minute mile not only was it
[1:28:03] dangerous it was impossible you know I
[1:28:08] think God loves that word impossible
[1:28:14] it's a barrier that cannot be broken
[1:28:19] thousands of years they said man has
[1:28:22] tried to break it in the 1940s the mile
[1:28:26] record was pushed to four minutes and
[1:28:28] one second where it stood for nine years
[1:28:40] they could not break that one because
[1:28:46] they had in their mind what's that said
[1:28:48] your lungs will explode your heart will
[1:28:51] burst you'll die well you might do it
[1:28:54] but you'll die you can't do it the body
[1:28:56] can't take it if they would run and
[1:28:59] sometimes they was one second off but
[1:29:02] perhaps brother weighs just perhaps as
[1:29:04] they was about to break that record the
[1:29:07] thoughts begin to come into the mind
[1:29:10] you're gonna blow your heart out you're
[1:29:13] gonna blow your legs out still never run
[1:29:14] again and perhaps they hesitated just
[1:29:17] enough to miss the mark by one second
[1:29:23] nine years but on May the 6th 1954 there
[1:29:31] was a man by the name of Roger Bannister
[1:29:33] broke the four-minute barrier
[1:29:39] he ran the mile in three minutes
[1:29:43] 59.4
[1:29:53] think of it and they said Roger how did
[1:29:56] you do that he said help him my mind a
[1:30:00] vision I saw myself breaking the record
[1:30:04] I saw myself going across that mark I
[1:30:06] saw the clock I saw that it said it was
[1:30:09] under four minutes I kept that before me
[1:30:11] we're not trained when I ran I didn't
[1:30:13] listen to what they said I didn't listen
[1:30:15] to the reports I didn't listen to the
[1:30:17] experts I kept a vision before me that I
[1:30:20] would break that barrier but I want you
[1:30:24] to notice not only did Roger have to
[1:30:26] break that barrier the four minutes he
[1:30:28] had to break the barrier sighs he had to
[1:30:30] break the barrier of myth he had to
[1:30:32] break the barrier of entrance he had to
[1:30:34] go against everything that everybody
[1:30:36] said he had to deny it he had to cast it
[1:30:39] down he had to refuse it he had to push
[1:30:42] beyond the barriers but when he did when
[1:30:51] he did
[1:30:52] when roger bannister broke the
[1:30:54] four-minute mile other saw that it could
[1:30:59] be done the four-minute mile barrier has
[1:31:08] since been broken by many male athletes
[1:31:10] and now today is the standard not the
[1:31:15] exception the standard of all male
[1:31:18] professional middle distance runners in
[1:31:23] the last 50 years the Mao record has
[1:31:27] been lowered by almost 17 seconds
[1:31:33] because one man broke the barrier you
[1:31:38] said brother I want you to say that's
[1:31:39] simply this that I don't need everybody
[1:31:40] in this building to break the barrier
[1:31:42] this morning I'll just be one person one
[1:31:44] person that can push through one person
[1:31:46] that can break through and once one
[1:31:48] person breaks through what's one person
[1:31:50] they say oh my brother Charlie got it I
[1:31:52] can get it his brother Terry got it I
[1:31:54] can get it one person breaking through
[1:31:56] it
[1:31:57] remember left over in Switzerland when
[1:31:59] the man said this day I'll give my life
[1:32:01] for Switzerland and he said follow me
[1:32:03] get what you can get follow me and he
[1:32:05] ran right into the ranks of that army
[1:32:07] that had moved upon their country and he
[1:32:09] broke the ranks at once he broke that
[1:32:12] right he gave his life but when he broke
[1:32:14] the rank they ran through it and whoop
[1:32:17] that army hey man I just need one person
[1:32:21] to break that barrier and we'll whoop
[1:32:23] the devil's army amen it's like a plane
[1:32:35] that struggles and struggles to break
[1:32:37] the sound barrier
[1:32:38] it just keeps pushing just keep
[1:32:40] believing break through the barriers
[1:32:42] unbelief break through that thought that
[1:32:44] tells you it's not for you you'll never
[1:32:47] be will you've had this problem with
[1:32:49] lust for years you've got this beset
[1:32:51] easy and you've got this trouble of
[1:32:52] pornography you've tried to overcome it
[1:32:54] it's alive the devil I tell you if one
[1:32:56] man overcoming if one woman overcoming
[1:32:59] you can overcome it come on somebody if
[1:33:01] God healed one of cancer God can heal
[1:33:03] you of cancer if I can save one marriage
[1:33:05] God can save your marriage they may have
[1:33:12] what to really don't appreciate figura
[1:33:14] go on positive affirmations he loves me
[1:33:17] he wants to heal me he wants to save me
[1:33:19] he wants to revive me he wants me to
[1:33:22] break through and once you break through
[1:33:24] others can follow pray until you pass
[1:33:30] the doubt barrier then you're running
[1:33:32] free then you're running free you're
[1:33:37] past the unbelief it's done been settled
[1:33:40] it's all over when you get the assurance
[1:33:42] in your heart it's going to be that way
[1:33:45] you're just as happy as if it's already
[1:33:48] happening
[1:33:52] Hey
[1:33:54] like gyrus his daughter when his
[1:33:57] daughter was dying he went to find Jesus

[1:34:06] would you come to my house you know what
[1:34:08] Jesus said I'll go see how simple it is
[1:34:13] and as they started can you imagine how
[1:34:16] he felt he just seen the woman with the
[1:34:18] bloody shoe healed can you imagine how
[1:34:21] he felt me and Jesus would be FFC she's
[1:34:32] coming the back of us let me taste it I
[1:34:36] guarantee you Jesus come to your house
[1:34:38] you wouldn't say it like you're sitting

[1:34:44] I don't even agree with Donald Trump I'm
[1:34:47] not a Republican or Democrat don't get
[1:34:49] mad I just don't I'm a Christian but if
[1:34:52] Donald took them to my house I would be
[1:34:54] excited if the mayor of John City come
[1:34:58] to my house I'd be pretty excited just
[1:35:03] out of respect but here Jesus was coming
[1:35:06] to his household can you imagine how
[1:35:09] excited he must have been because don't
[1:35:11] you see the Jesus agreeing to go was
[1:35:13] just the same as his daughters and son
[1:35:15] being healed it's gonna be any children
[1:35:17] oh my I'm telling you you know he he was
[1:35:24] stirred Jesus is coming to my house

[1:35:30] don't know he was excited and no sooner
[1:35:34] did he started getting excited here
[1:35:37] comes the barriers here comes the
[1:35:41] mourners here comes the people that with
[1:35:43] the church with well I don't know they
[1:35:48] said trouble not to master anymore
[1:35:50] your little girl is dead and all that
[1:35:53] joy all that excitement that one
[1:35:56] hindrance yes
[1:36:01] deflated him you know my mama god rest
[1:36:07] her so she told me for years when I was
[1:36:08] little boy she said you know Burt she
[1:36:10] said you know Darrell as long as there's
[1:36:13] breath there's hope and that's a good
[1:36:16] sailor but one day I said you know mama
[1:36:17] that's true I said I taste something
[1:36:19] better than that
[1:36:20] even when there's no breath or still
[1:36:22] hope how do ya
[1:36:29] and all Jesus did was touching on the
[1:36:32] shoulder and you know what he said
[1:36:35] only believe you know why I said that
[1:36:40] because that's what breaks the barrier
[1:36:42] you see Satan wants us to compromise
[1:36:48] yes he does when Jessica was in that
[1:36:53] condition in the hospital somebody I
[1:36:55] worked with I appreciate incoming I
[1:36:56] really do they came down there just to
[1:36:57] visit I I was out I went and done
[1:36:59] something and sure was there and this
[1:37:01] person I worked with come and they they
[1:37:02] had a boy that had that had spinal
[1:37:05] meningitis as a challenge a real high
[1:37:07] fever and it left the boy deaf and she
[1:37:11] come tutto Cheryl she said you know said
[1:37:13] I forget the boy's name but she said you
[1:37:16] know they told us he was going to be
[1:37:17] deaf but we were willing to accept it
[1:37:20] just to have her little boy and so say
[1:37:25] when she said that to her something
[1:37:27] inside of her raised up and said but we
[1:37:29] won't accept that
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:32] see Satan wants you to accept something
[1:37:35] less something less than what God has
[1:37:38] for you but let me tell you for this if
[1:37:40] Sam Walton was my daddy
[1:37:42] I wouldn't go to Walmart with a basket
[1:37:44] I've done a Walmart with the truck
[1:37:46] God says asked me for big things
[1:37:49] don't you see when you ask God for big
[1:37:52] things you are telling God I think
[1:37:54] you're a big God when you ask God for
[1:38:01] the impossible you're telling God I
[1:38:04] believe God you can do the impossible
[1:38:13] amen amen
[1:38:16] God's Word says so that settles it he's
[1:38:18] my healer he's my joy
[1:38:19] he's my deliverer you see the devil
[1:38:22] knows if you can just use a little faith
[1:38:24] he's defeated Amen you said brother I
[1:38:31] don't know if I can believe or not well
[1:38:33] can't you halfway believe you see if you
[1:38:36] can just halfway believe the devil still
[1:38:38] defeated
[1:38:43] amen oh I got a hurry look at that woman
[1:38:47] with the bloody shoe she had plenty of
[1:38:49] hindrances she had plenty of barriers
[1:38:52] she had been sick 12 years the doctor
[1:38:56] said they couldn't help her the doctor
[1:38:58] said you'll never be well when she got
[1:39:00] down out of where Jesus was not only did
[1:39:03] she have what the doctor said not only
[1:39:05] did you have what everybody else was
[1:39:06] saying not only did she have the
[1:39:07] evidence of 12 years of a blood issue
[1:39:09] that wouldn't stop all those barriers
[1:39:11] then when she got down there guess what
[1:39:12] she found a crowd she could even get to
[1:39:14] Jesus and everybody was touching him
[1:39:16] everybody was touching Jesus what was it
[1:39:19] barrier a barrier
[1:39:20] what is it Satan trying to stop us from
[1:39:23] receiving what's ours she had physical
[1:39:29] barriers spiritual barriers everything
[1:39:31] trying to turn her back all the noise
[1:39:35] all the confusion the devil telling her

[1:45:42] revival let me close Chuck Yeager was
[1:45:50] the first man to ever break the sound
[1:45:53] barrier and I read just the other day I
[1:45:55] think it was he done it again almost on
[1:46:00] the exact same moment in time 50 years
[1:46:03] later I think it was 80 years left 50 I
[1:46:06] don't know when it was some so many
[1:46:07] years later Chuck Yeager 84 year old
[1:46:10] climbed back in the cockpit and broke
[1:46:12] the sound barrier again you know what
[1:46:15] that tells me if you've done it once
[1:46:19] [Applause]
[1:46:21] we could do it again Hey
[1:46:29] but you see he had to have something to
[1:46:32] break that barrier with and let me say
[1:46:36] this morning so do you the hindrances
[1:46:38] and the barriers of satan the voices are
[1:46:41] real friends it's his job that's his
[1:46:44] desire is to keep you from receiving
[1:46:46] what God died for you to have C signal
[1:46:53] care if you come to church as long as
[1:46:55] you come defeated a defeated soldiers
[1:47:01] one of the hardest soldiers you could
[1:47:02] ever get to fight that's why many times
[1:47:05] when soldiers get that battle fatigue
[1:47:06] they'll pull him off the field and send
[1:47:08] him over to Hawaii and let him rest up a
[1:47:09] little bit he will know he wants you to
[1:47:14] do is come to church fill up this place
[1:47:16] set defeated you see Chuck Yeager had to
[1:47:22] have something to break that bird he
[1:47:24] used an airplane and I say to you this
[1:47:26] morning as I'm closing our vehicle that
[1:47:29] God has given us it's not a motion it's
[1:47:31] not sensation it's not mind over matter
[1:47:34] it's faith faith breaks the barrier and
[1:47:41] once that barrier is broke it's
[1:47:44] unlimited it's unlimited to what God can
[1:47:48] do to a person who believed him
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:54] who believe there's no limit
[1:47:58] send that plane it'll shake it'll rattle
[1:48:01] the Prophet said the boats about come
[1:48:02] out of the wings how many people was
[1:48:05] almost at that barrier and they pulled
[1:48:07] back because they sprayed the plane
[1:48:08] would break apart right there at that
[1:48:11] moment almost pushing through and then
[1:48:14] they let the devil tell him I wouldn't
[1:48:15] go up further thighs you you know you
[1:48:17] don't like to walk in front of people
[1:48:20] they're gonna look at your dress we
[1:48:23] don't care what kind of dress you're
[1:48:24] wearing we just want to see your help

[1:48:31] help this morning a man breaking the
[1:48:36] barriers let me share this with you

[1:48:42] this with you as we're closing trust of
[1:48:45] not being too long but I don't I want to
[1:48:47] share this with you I thought this was
[1:48:49] so good there's another definition for
[1:48:51] barrier all the ones we're a barricade a
[1:48:56] block a hindrance obstruction and
[1:48:59] pigment but there's another word for
[1:49:01] barrier and that's used in horse racing
[1:49:07] it's called the gate bear the gate
[1:49:11] barrier is where they put the horses
[1:49:14] before they start the race it's that
[1:49:17] gate that the horse stands behind and
[1:49:21] when they fire off that pistol and the
[1:49:23] gate flies open then he runs and I want
[1:49:26] you to understand this morning we're not
[1:49:29] hybrids we're a real race horses
[1:49:35] our genetics is from our daddy you know
[1:49:40] my brother d'Alene just done his DNA he
[1:49:43] said you know you get 50% from your mom
[1:49:45] and 50% from your daddy but I want you
[1:49:47] to know this morning we're all dead II
[1:49:52] and I want you to see that this barrier
[1:49:55] this gate barrier is just like the gait
[1:49:58] of a racehorse I want you to understand
[1:50:00] you know where they put the Scarecrow in
[1:50:02] the garden where the best fruit is why
[1:50:04] do they put it there to keep the coal
[1:50:06] out of the strawberries
[1:50:08] what is the Scarecrow telling you the
[1:50:11] Scarecrow is really telling you not to
[1:50:13] stay out it's really telling either
[1:50:14] something good in there don't you see
[1:50:18] when Satan tries to play some barrier
[1:50:20] don't you understand what Satan's trying
[1:50:22] to tell you he knows there's a finish
[1:50:24] line he knows there's a victory line
[1:50:26] he's trying to stop you but you know
[1:50:28] what the player should do the bear
[1:50:30] shouldn't be a hindrance the bear should
[1:50:31] tell me I'm fixing to run I'm fixin to
[1:50:39] go towards a victory lane a man do you
[1:50:46] love him this morning that little shadow
[1:50:50] of darkness that hangs over you that
[1:50:54] little down there if you could ever
[1:50:58] break through that little barrier and
[1:50:59] get free thank you lord thank you lord
[1:51:06] you remember the eagle brother man
[1:51:09] talked about that was in the cage up in
[1:51:10] Cincinnati he said I could talk if I had
[1:51:13] the money I would buy him and set him
[1:51:14] free and that eager would run his crash
[1:51:16] against that cage and he'd fall back you
[1:51:21] see he done that brother Larry because
[1:51:23] he wanted to go where God built him to
[1:51:26] go
[1:51:27] he wanted to fly into the heavens
[1:51:30] because he was built to fly into the
[1:51:32] heavens and what he needed brother Eddie
[1:51:37] what he needed was not a set of wings
[1:51:41] that would lift him out of the cage he
[1:51:43] had the wings to do it all he needed was
[1:51:47] to break the barrier and say all you
[1:51:51] need to do this morning is break the
[1:51:54] barrier it's like getting a bird out of
[1:52:01] the cage he's got the wings he just

[1:52:26] and use it breaking the barriers of
[1:52:32] doubt once you break through friends

[1:54:34] are too emotional people not emotional
[1:54:36] enough see Lord we realized Satan don't
[1:54:40] care what ditch we're in as long as
[1:54:43] we're in a ditch but God I pray this
[1:54:47] morning Lord I know it's just a simple
[1:54:49] thought God but but I looked at these
[1:54:52] things that started my heart Lord how
[1:54:55] that woman pushed through the crowd and
[1:54:56] her bloody she stopped how Irish broke
[1:55:01] that barrier Lord his daughter was given

[1:56:01] pulled him up on a roof who tore off the
[1:56:05] roof and let him down in the midst of
[1:56:08] the people because they knew if they
[1:56:10] could get him to Jesus he would walk
[1:56:13] home himself Oh God let me be that kind
[1:56:17] of friend this morning then a tear off

[1:56:32] moment or that someone else could be
[1:56:37] helped that someone could be touched
