[29:07] I've often wondered about Barabbas how
[29:13] he felt that afternoon wherever he went
[29:21] when they set him free that night when
[29:24] he laid down I wonder what he fell now
[29:27] have you ever thought about that I
[29:29] wonder what he was thinking that he I
[29:31] wonder if he went by and looked up on
[29:34] the hill and then I got to thinking I
[29:38] wonder if he felt what I felt that
[29:45] afternoon in Jonesboro Tennessee in an
[29:47] old building when I knelt down here by
[29:49] myself and that feeling I felt when I
[29:53] got up I was free
[30:00] no more alcohol no more drugs I was free
[30:08] the man in the middle made me free have
[30:15] I failed him yes I have a failure but
[30:19] he's not one time ever failed me well
[30:25] Kate you loved him for that tonight
[30:28] praise the Lord
[30:30] if you have your Bibles to see the tert
[30:32] with us to the we only read from the
[30:35] book of Ephesians chapter 1 verse 10 and
[30:44] then also from Psalms 68 verse 20 the
[30:49] Gooch in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[30:51] kind of honored to be here this evening
[30:56] remember our sick and afflicted and just
[31:00] trust the Lord Jesus the move for my
[31:01] brother different ones in the hospital
[31:03] right now and we serve a God who's
[31:10] certainly able amen praise the Lord
[31:15] that some gun Ephesians 1 verse 10 and
[31:23] then we're gonna read from Psalms 68 20
[31:27] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[31:30] of times he might gather together in one
[31:34] all things in Christ both which are in
[31:39] heaven and which are on earth even in
[31:42] him even in him now Psalms 68 20
[32:04] the Bible says this he that is our God
[32:09] is the god of salvation he maybe won't
[32:16] be old Buddha sitting on the throne it
[32:17] won't be hairy Krishna come on somebody
[32:20] won't be some Islamic he that is our God
[32:25] is the god of salvation and unto God the
[32:29] Lord belong the issues from death unto
[32:33] our God belong the issues from death now
[32:38] that word issues means escape
[32:40] in other words unto our God belongs the
[32:44] escape from death he owns it hallelujah

[36:06] drop it fell and I said my it looks like
[36:08] it's going to rain I said I hope you
[36:10] don't get wet and the person taking my
[36:14] order said this to me
[36:15] they said I hope I can be like Noah and
[36:19] get inside before the rain comes
[36:25] [Applause]
[36:27] and I said to this person me too
[36:39] [Music]
[36:40] and the reason I said that was that the
[36:44] person taking order was a young person
[36:47] that used to come to our church I won't
[36:51] speak to you tonight for just a few
[36:53] minutes on getting inside before it
[36:56] rains or for the tape as I told the
[37:01] brothers gathering to escape gathering
[37:08] to escape you see a gathering is always
[37:12] a reaction to an action
[37:17] people don't just gather there's always
[37:19] a reason why somebody gathers for church
[37:22] for a wedding for a funeral whatever it
[37:24] would be so we see them that a gathering
[37:27] is that actually a reaction because
[37:29] something has caused a gathering
[37:32] you know this September I will be on the
[37:36] field evangelizing 29 years the Lord
[37:42] spoke to me back when I was turned
[37:44] thirty year old I was 29 at the time and
[37:46] I felt like the Lord spoke to me one day
[37:48] and said when you turn 30
[37:49] you'll start traveling and when I turned
[37:53] 30 year old the first place I went was
[37:54] down in Beaufort South Carolina and
[37:56] preached for brother John Keith and from
[37:59] there it kind of developed to where
[38:00] we're at tonight but 29 years on the
[38:04] field evangelizing 19 years this June
[38:07] full-time and I stand humbly not to brag
[38:12] on myself I just want to make a point
[38:13] but I was going 166 days from home last
[38:17] year you know in 29 years on the field
[38:23] you get a little sentimental I guess and
[38:27] I was driving down through Missouri the
[38:29] other day
[38:33] and I got to thinking about all the
[38:36] meetings that I've had in Missouri down
[38:40] through the years as a as a young man 31
[38:42] 32 year old brother David Siler bosom
[38:45] buddy he used to follow me over it's
[38:47] just a young boy come to all my meetings
[38:49] down in Missouri up down into Arkansas I
[38:52] know David for years
[38:54] Wayne Lawson knew he went as a boy and I
[38:58] got to thinking about all the meetings
[39:00] brother Jean and I got to thinking about
[39:01] all the different brothers and sisters
[39:03] that I had seen in those meetings you
[39:06] know the potluck sector service was over
[39:08] and set around the table and just
[39:10] fellowship and and I begin to think this
[39:12] brother is gone and that sister is gone
[39:14] and that brother's gone and as I was
[39:17] thinking about these things I thought
[39:19] all what I wouldn't give to go back
[39:23] would tub and to being one of them
[39:28] services again it's the me that brother
[39:32] Leon Wilson's I loved that precious
[39:34] brother he's been dead for years I I was
[39:36] there the night he died I used to go
[39:39] down he was old have you Mississippi
[39:41] accent no brother Leon you know he used
[39:43] to say brother walk come down here to
[39:45] the multi-purpose building and I thought
[39:49] what I wouldn't give to go back to the
[39:50] multi-purpose building just one more
[39:53] time but you see change his heart
[40:05] how wonderful it would be but you see
[40:08] it'll never be for the Bible says here
[40:13] we have no continuing City those days
[40:18] are gone those meetings are in the
[40:21] history books if you will we can never
[40:24] gather back like that again the
[40:26] multi-purpose building it don't even
[40:28] exist them or that whole thing is going
[40:30] now and so we can never gather back
[40:35] again to the multi-purpose building but
[40:39] there is the place hallelujah
[40:41] what we all can gather together what
[40:45] will never have to part and that is in
[40:48] him that is in Christ there's going to
[40:53] be a meeting in the air and we'll never
[40:56] have to part again you see I'm talking
[41:00] about gathering gathering in him an
[41:05] action a reaction to an action I you
[41:08] know one of my favorite characters in
[41:09] history
[41:10] it's Geronimo you know I've read his
[41:16] autobiography and I'm you know brother
[41:19] man said he was a real gentleman only
[41:20] fighting for his god-given rights and
[41:24] Geronimo in his autobiography talked
[41:27] about how he was down at the market one
[41:28] day and all the way back from the market
[41:31] they was met with some runners who told
[41:34] him that the Mexicans had attacked the
[41:36] village while he was down at the market
[41:39] they had come into the village
[41:41] and had killed all the women and the
[41:43] children and the old men and he said
[41:47] when I heard the news that the village
[41:49] had been attacked he said I found that
[41:52] my aged mother and my wife and my three
[41:57] little girls were all among the dead
[42:02] they had all been slain and Geronimo
[42:07] said there were no lights in the camp so
[42:10] without being noticed he said I silently
[42:13] turned away
[42:14] and stood down by the river it said how
[42:19] long yesterday I do not know because she
[42:21] said I had no purpose left in my life
[42:25] everything had been tooken away from me
[42:28] I didn't care if I lived or if I died
[42:32] said how long I stood there I do not
[42:35] know he said but when I saw the Warriors
[42:40] arranging for Council
[42:43] Geronimo said I took my place I gathered
[42:48] around the council fire with the rest of
[42:51] the Warriors and when it comes to make
[42:54] the move when it comes to do a
[42:56] retaliation when it comes to strike back
[42:58] against the Mexicans who done this to
[43:00] his people he said I gathered with the
[43:03] lawyers and I found my place among them
[43:09] brother Brennan talked about the mages
[43:12] that they were stargazers and they
[43:15] watched the heavens for the sign of the
[43:17] Messiah to manifest and the prophets
[43:20] said they worshiped the one true God and
[43:24] so they would go up on the rooftop and
[43:26] they would build a fire because they
[43:29] knew that that was true God dwelled in
[43:32] fire and they would gather their self
[43:35] around the sacred fire watching and
[43:40] waiting for a sign of the Messiah
[43:43] waiting for God to move they would
[43:47] gather around the sacred fire you see
[43:49] something was causing them to gather
[43:52] geronimo of the Warriors were gathering
[43:55] for revenge they were gathering for
[43:57] stargazers to see the sign of the
[43:59] Messiah to see God move and I say to you
[44:05] I don't know where you're at tonight I
[44:06] don't know what you're living at tonight
[44:08] I don't know what your plans are for the
[44:10] future I don't even know what you think
[44:12] about this message tonight but what I
[44:14] want to say to everybody who hears my
[44:16] voice tonight I want you to understand
[44:18] whatever your plans are brother sister I
[44:21] want you to know it's gathering time
[44:23] [Applause]
[44:25] and when you see God's people begin to
[44:29] gather around
[44:30] and unite the self around the pillar of
[44:33] fire when you see God's people fighting
[44:37] the Saints around the sacred fire of God
[44:40] the Holy Spirit manifests in the midst
[44:43] of the people I tell you find your place
[44:49] find your place around the fire of God
[44:52] because it's moving time the Prophet
[44:58] talked about mother Eagle and how she
[45:00] took her little ones and set them down
[45:03] into a field and flew high up on the
[45:07] cliff of a rock had said him
[45:09] and the Prophet was watching through
[45:12] binoculars and he wants those little
[45:14] Eagles he said ma what did you believe
[45:17] they were having when I listened to him
[45:21] describe this I thought I'd like to be
[45:23] in a church service like that they were
[45:25] just jumping over one another they were
[45:28] chirping they were happy you know I
[45:32] don't know why people scared of noise in
[45:34] church I don't understand why people
[45:40] scared of noise in church
[45:46] her brother injuries say it one time and
[45:48] I was down in Florida actually saw it
[45:50] myself but there's a sign down there the
[45:53] people at the in Florida around the
[45:54] local air force base were complaining
[45:56] about the f-18s in the 16s and all the
[45:59] noise that they make there's one fluid
[46:01] the house still they rattled the windows
[46:02] and they were flying and the people were
[46:05] complaining about the noise and they
[46:07] wanted it to stop so the Air Force put
[46:10] up a big sign at the gate said pardon
[46:13] our noise but it's the sound of freedom
[46:18] hallelujah when you're afraid if I go to
[46:20] church
[46:21] somebody might scream well part in our
[46:23] scream part in our shell father
[46:25] hallelujah
[46:27] but it's the sound of freedom
[46:33] paranoia the blood of Jesus Christ has
[46:37] made us free no more condemnation it's
[46:41] under the blood they were jumping and
[46:47] frolicking having a big time and the
[46:49] Prophet was watching him they said all
[46:52] that was way off in the North said a
[46:55] northerner started thundering the
[46:57] Thunder begin to roar he said I watched
[47:00] that mother he goes to she threw up that
[47:02] head she began to look said she let out
[47:07] a scream and come off that rock and flew
[47:11] down into that grassy field and
[47:13] stretched forth her wings and he said
[47:15] perhaps the little ones being instructed
[47:17] before they left the nest she must have
[47:21] told him in case you need to escape this
[47:23] is what you do
[47:26] she was giving it all she was giving
[47:30] them instructions how to get out of the
[47:32] field safely
[47:35] and he said perhaps been instructed
[47:37] before they left the news that here they
[47:39] come running and he said they grabbed a
[47:41] hold of those calls grabbed a hold of
[47:43] their weeds look they're beak into those
[47:45] feathers and he said she lifted off that
[47:50] metal with all those little Eagles on
[47:52] her back flew straight into a storm that
[47:55] was blowing 40 mile an hour the Prophet
[48:00] God said I cried like a baby
[48:03] because he said I thought someday he'll
[48:06] come from glory he'll stretch forth his
[48:08] wings Luther knows his place
[48:10] Wesley knows his place hallelujah we
[48:13] know our place each of us being
[48:15] instructed hallelujah by the revealed
[48:18] Word of God for our day we know exactly
[48:20] where we are exactly where we need to be
[48:22] [Applause]
[48:26] hallelujah and we'll grab a hold of the
[48:29] wings of Jehovah and he lifts us into
[48:31] glory
[48:32] [Applause]
[48:36] gathering to escape gathering to escape
[48:43] the purposes were coming down to the
[48:46] gathering time the harvest time
[48:48] Genesis was the planning of the seed and
[48:53] for six thousand years has been maturing
[48:56] of the harvest and now the seed has
[49:01] become seed itself
[49:06] the seed has become seen itself but it
[49:11] didn't go back this way it went full
[49:14] circle in other words it went through
[49:20] its cycle of growth that was a
[49:22] predetermined cycle for a wheat plant
[49:24] that she would plant it and it would go
[49:26] through its cycle and when it got to the
[49:28] final stage of growth it would be the
[49:31] maturity stage and how do you know that
[49:35] its mature because its seed again you
[49:41] see if the farmer harvest is any other
[49:43] time prior to having seed he can never
[49:45] have another crop so he must wait in
[49:48] love for the seed that was planted to go
[49:52] full cycle of growth and when it reaches
[49:58] a level when will he take this bride
[50:02] when she reaches a level of maturity
[50:04] that she can reproduce him of the earth
[50:07] again hallelujah but what is he coming
[50:12] for a bride who is bone of his bone
[50:14] flesh of his legs spirit of the spirit
[50:17] life of his life she is he loved the
[50:20] earth hallelujah it's seed time again
[50:26] it's see time again what's happening the
[50:29] seed it's coming to maturity now the
[50:36] seed has become seen itself he went back
[50:39] so the blossom from the blossom to the
[50:41] fruit in this gathering time now harvest
[50:45] time now all the great things that
[50:47] started the true church has started in
[50:49] Genesis has come down to the fruit town
[50:52] the fruit of the Spirit
[50:56] let me tell you something this bride
[50:58] will not be a barren bride she will not
[51:05] be a fig tree who bears no fruit come on
[51:08] somebody but she will bear and manifest
[51:12] the fruit of the Spirit hallelujah the
[51:19] Antichrist spirit has started the
[51:20] genesis has come down to its fruit and
[51:23] we're just now in the closing time of
[51:25] the world's entire dispensation of
[51:29] mortal beings everything is dying around
[51:37] us including our government
[51:44] [Music]
[51:44] [Applause]
[51:47] and yet the Prophet said it's the
[51:50] greatest time that anyone or any age
[51:53] ever lived is this time for brother
[51:57] though it's so dark it's so gloomy it's
[51:59] so cold the people are so hard
[52:01] hello it's a wonderful time it's a great
[52:04] time because the Bible said they would
[52:06] do that but when they are doing that
[52:08] they are a people on the earth who is
[52:10] the light of the other and they are
[52:12] manifested Alleluia they are manifested
[52:15] the life of Christ the greatest age can
[52:24] ever live here is this day God has given
[52:27] us the privilege to live in the greatest
[52:30] time it's a shakin time it's a
[52:34] troublesome time for sinners but it's a
[52:37] marvelous time for Christians because we
[52:43] know we are packing up giving the last
[52:46] little things together to go home to
[52:50] meet the Lord it's one of the most
[52:55] horrible times for the unbeliever and
[52:57] the sinner that he has ever witnessed
[53:01] because the due time is close at hand
[53:07] and it's the most blessed time for the
[53:09] believer the worst time for the sinner
[53:16] the blessed time for the believer and
[53:19] it's happening at the same time it's the
[53:28] most blessed time for the believer for
[53:30] the redemption is at hand the two
[53:32] factions is in the earth tonight the
[53:36] believer and the unbeliever the one the
[53:39] Lord is coming to receive and the one
[53:42] the Lord is coming to condemn and is
[53:45] coming he is coming he will do both at
[53:50] the same time he will receive one and
[53:54] condemn the other at the same time he
[54:03] will bless one and curse the other and
[54:05] his appearing so then we see we are at
[54:08] the gathering time it's sea time or
[54:10] harvest time the seed that was planted
[54:13] has come full cycle and now it's seed
[54:16] time again making him Alpha and Omega
[54:18] the beginning in the end the first and
[54:21] the last
[54:23] [Applause]
[54:25] it's the gathering time it's the
[54:28] gathering time because that's the only
[54:30] time for the theory that he can take her
[54:32] is in this season the season of the
[54:38] harvest the season of maturity the word
[54:46] has become flesh exactly like he
[54:49] promised in Luke 17 Malachi 4 see that's
[54:53] why revelations Oh true life that was in
[54:56] the stalk tassel and husk is now
[54:59] gathering in the seed
[55:02] no see see brother Jean I'll Luthor head
[55:05] Leslie god bless all Leslie head and it
[55:09] comes on down now we are the fullness
[55:11] the seven churches is the fullness of
[55:14] the previous six Church ages we are the
[55:17] consummation of Luther Wesley
[55:19] restoration of the gifts it's all come
[55:21] down to the seat on the seat chapter the
[55:24] harvest and and all that revelation all
[55:29] that life is now in her hallelujah
[55:34] manifesting what the fullness all glory
[55:43] to God now gathering in the seed ready
[55:47] for the resurrection ready for the
[55:49] harvest the Alpha has become the omega
[55:56] the groom has become the blood
[56:06] they lujah the first has come last and
[56:11] the last is first the seed that we're in
[56:15] has come through a process that has
[56:18] become seed again jesus said that be
[56:22] fearful signs in the heavens we got him
[56:29] they call him UFOs the Prophet said they
[56:32] were investigating angels fearful sights
[56:36] in the heavens man's hearts failing for
[56:39] fear perplexity of times distress
[56:42] between nations
[56:45] sounds like evening news it foxes don't
[56:49] you see he says the seed time is here
[56:53] now
[56:54] [Applause]
[56:56] harvest time the things the Bible said
[56:58] would come to place the seed that's been
[57:00] planted don't you see it it's taken life
[57:03] the seed that was planted it's taking
[57:06] life and it's living it's living it's
[57:13] living you see it's the seed taking life
[57:17] that's what's causing the gathering
[57:20] [Applause]
[57:23] the reaction of an action it's moving
[57:27] time
[57:28] there's no question it's moving time
[57:31] that's not the question the question
[57:33] tonight is what are you gathering - its
[57:38] gathering time it's moving time that's a
[57:41] given we there's no use there's no
[57:43] debate on that but the real question is
[57:47] is what are you gathering - because you
[57:49] see every person in this building man
[57:51] woman boy girl you don't matter every
[57:53] one of us must gather to something
[57:59] because it's gathering time you see
[58:05] friends don't you see that's why they
[58:06] said among us for years
[58:08] by the genes for years they said among
[58:11] us they live singing in our churches but
[58:14] where are they tonight they're going
[58:17] they went out from us because they were
[58:20] not a part of us they are gathering to
[58:23] the room they are gathering to the road
[58:26] but we are also gathering it's gathering
[58:39] time gathering to escape
[58:46] you see that sign right there above the
[58:48] door that is a lighted exit son
[58:53] they are markers to tell us in case of
[58:58] an emergency
[58:59] how did scape how to get out of this
[59:03] building if you need to leave quickly if
[59:09] we need to escape if we need to get out
[59:12] these signs these lighted exit signs
[59:16] show us the well let's say that I said
[59:25] humbly God knows I do but I flew a
[59:27] hundred eleven thousand air miles last
[59:29] year and every flight I was ever owned
[59:33] they gave the emergency whatever that's
[59:37] called
[59:39] thank you and they'll stand out there
[59:43] two exits at the back two in the middle
[59:46] two here and look behind you the exit
[59:47] behind you might be the closest exit
[59:49] loving any lights in the aisle will
[59:51] instruct you on how to get out and if
[59:56] you're sitting at the exit door you have
[59:57] to read the card to tell you how to open
[1:00:00] the door but worried about me opening
[1:00:04] that probably remember it but you know
[1:00:09] what I see on those flights
[1:00:10] same thing you see if you've ever flew
[1:00:13] people looking at magazines people send
[1:00:15] the text people with their earbuds in
[1:00:17] people looking at their iPads nobody
[1:00:20] pays attention nobody listens to what
[1:00:23] that poor woman says and she has to do
[1:00:25] it every flight do you know why they
[1:00:28] don't listen you know why they don't
[1:00:30] look up you know why they don't look for
[1:00:32] the exit sign because they don't think
[1:00:34] they need it but I saw just last week
[1:00:41] where a window blew out of the plane and
[1:00:43] about shut the copilot out I'd say
[1:00:45] somebody was looking for the exit sign
[1:00:48] [Applause]
[1:00:53] they don't pay attention people don't
[1:00:56] pay attention in church they'll laugh
[1:00:58] and get notes and get up and go to the
[1:01:00] bathroom 57 times in one service you
[1:01:03] know why they don't think they need to
[1:01:04] hear what's being said but let a fire
[1:01:12] break out let us shoot or cut into the
[1:01:14] church get on somebody let an emergency
[1:01:18] break out now all of a sudden everybody
[1:01:20] trying to find the exit but a lot of
[1:01:22] times it's too late the chaos is on them
[1:01:31] the destruction is on them it's only
[1:01:35] those who are prepared against the hour
[1:01:39] will escape did you see the news the
[1:01:46] other day in Hawaii where some guy
[1:01:49] pushed the wrong button
[1:01:50] of course he's looking for a job but he
[1:01:54] pushed the wrong button and everybody
[1:01:57] started getting text imminent nuclear

[1:02:36] people ran into the police station they
[1:02:39] ran into hospitals people called their
[1:02:41] kids and said hey you know that was
[1:02:42] vacation to learn Hawaii after laying on
[1:02:45] the beach and they called the game daddy
[1:02:48] wants to do what we're getting won't see
[1:02:50] you no more people screaming people
[1:02:54] crying people hugging one another people
[1:02:56] running not knowing where to go
[1:03:02] 13 minutes back what would you do
[1:03:08] tonight if you knew you had exactly 13
[1:03:12] minutes to live and yet before the
[1:03:20] service is over thousands of people will
[1:03:22] die in the United States thirteen
[1:03:29] minutes running into a church but it was
[1:03:33] too late the church could not help them
[1:03:36] the police could not help them they were
[1:03:39] trying to find a place themselves but
[1:03:44] you see it was fake it wasn't real it
[1:03:46] was a mistake but the point I'm making
[1:03:50] is when it's trucked in the realization
[1:03:53] I'm fixing to be destroyed they were not
[1:03:56] ready like in the days of Noah with Noah
[1:04:03] predicted 120 years and though his
[1:04:08] message was a message of mercy the
[1:04:10] people failed to heed the message it was
[1:04:15] something that was said to save them and
[1:04:17] yet they would not listen that's a very
[1:04:22] beautiful picture of the times of today
[1:04:27] how could you say beautiful brother
[1:04:29] branham painting the pictures less like
[1:04:32] that
[1:04:32] he said it's beautiful because the Lord
[1:04:37] Jesus is coming soon for his church it's
[1:04:40] the most beautiful felt than any
[1:04:41] creature of God's could ever think of to
[1:04:44] get out of this chaos to get into the
[1:04:48] Blessed glory where the old will be
[1:04:50] young forever and the sick will be
[1:04:54] healed forever there'll be no more
[1:04:58] sorrows no more heartaches if that ain't
[1:05:02] the most beautiful picture I can think
[1:05:07] how blessed it is for those who are
[1:05:10] waiting for that gathering time it's
[1:05:14] beautiful what makes it so beautiful is
[1:05:17] because in that time of judgment there
[1:05:20] was a door and escape it was in the
[1:05:26] earth that God had provided under our
[1:05:34] God the god of salvation belongs the
[1:05:37] escape from death our God owns the
[1:05:41] escape route
[1:05:42] the exit don't you see who the exit
[1:05:46] lighted sign is it's Christ I am the
[1:05:51] light of the world he said I am the way
[1:05:53] the truth and the life I am the door I
[1:05:57] am the door that time of judgment what
[1:06:05] did God provide for them he provided for
[1:06:07] them an escape route an escape door he
[1:06:12] was in the art that God had provided and
[1:06:15] to her God belongs the escape from their
[1:06:17] God turned for those who care to escape
[1:06:20] in the days of Noah and they sent them a
[1:06:23] profit and that profit directed them to
[1:06:25] God's provided way God's Way of doing
[1:06:31] things God spoke to know and told Noah
[1:06:34] to prepare the ark for the saving of his
[1:06:36] people to warn all the people in the end
[1:06:39] one way of salvation one way not three
[1:06:44] not five what I'm gonna do it my own way
[1:06:46] I really to a guy on the airport deal
[1:06:54] they used to be in this message he tried
[1:06:55] to explain to me his way of salvation
[1:06:58] not only was that confused he was
[1:07:00] confused that's my way he said that's
[1:07:06] the way I think it is but if they don't
[1:07:09] line up with the word it's not our way
[1:07:12] [Applause]
[1:07:16] nor will prepare the ark in a man was a
[1:07:21] vindicated prophet to prove the way of
[1:07:22] escape humble and sincere heard this man
[1:07:26] heard him that escaped the death of the
[1:07:30] world of sin the world was being
[1:07:33] destroyed in that day they escaped the
[1:07:36] death threat that was laying upon the
[1:07:38] whole world God so came for them when
[1:07:43] the world was on the death row the whole
[1:07:44] world he said my spirit what I always
[1:07:47] strive with man and the whole world was
[1:07:49] on a death row but God cared for those
[1:07:51] who came to escape thank God provided an
[1:07:54] escape route
[1:07:55] God provided an exit sign God provided
[1:07:58] an escape door for those who wanted to
[1:08:00] leave the pool was so great I want you
[1:08:06] to think about this I'll hurry but the
[1:08:08] pool is so great - even the animals know
[1:08:13] that something was wrong the pool the
[1:08:17] pool to escape was so great that even
[1:08:22] the animals felt the pool prophet said I
[1:08:25] see old mother bird sent a pair father
