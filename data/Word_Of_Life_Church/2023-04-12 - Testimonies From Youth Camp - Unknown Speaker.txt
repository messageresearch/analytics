[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] above the Peaks my soul can be found an unexpected drive me from the Heights thank you Lord foreign [Music] [Music] let's read the scripture together tonight Mark chapter 16. verse 15. and he said unto them go ye into all the world and what preach wow now who is this saying this Jesus the founder of the church the builder of the church this is the way he started it now remember when the prophet was looking for the symbols to be able to type who the church AIDS Messengers would be down Through the Ages God revealed to him a very simple principle it was that God never changes so on that principle he was able to find out who the first church age messenger was and then everyone thereafter by that very same principle it shouldn't be a surprise to us that Satan will want to change that principle in this last day but for myself I can only speak for me of course I ain't going to let him do it if our God is not the same yesterday and forever we are in a mess of trouble now listen what he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that Believers and is baptized shall be saved shall not be bride but shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned now that's pretty simple is it not and these signs might possibly ever now and then these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover may the Lord bless his words you can be seated we're going to do something a little bit different here tonight you figured that already didn't you the Lord blessed us in such a wonderful way down at um at the youth camp and I'm sure some of you probably streamed it and brother Ron Brother Andrew just did an outstanding job morning services and not services and what the Lord did and I thought tonight that it might be a good thing if we would let some of these young people who have experienced the power of God and some of the things that the Lord has done for them if they would be able to share with you their testimony now you may not know it but there are every year when it comes around the spring camp time there will be preachers that'll start preaching against it and Blasting it don't want their kids to go and all that sort of thing but myself seeing what what has happened at that camp let me give you just a little bit of a background of the camp in Louisiana the first one was in 1987. brother John LaFontaine preached it it was not at the current location where it's been since most of you all have been there but it was at a very small place the second year there was a hillbilly boy that preached it from Kentucky 1988. and thereafter I preached it for many years and it was about probably 89 me and Carol was trying to think about either 89 or 90 that we started taking a busload sometimes two bus loads of our kids down there now I've not done this because I feel that it's the political correct thing to do I've done it because I have with my own eyes seen what the Lord God has done and change people's lives forever absolutely forever people that's gotten saved people's got filled the Holy Ghost people that's gotten healed just phenomenal things that's happened and let me say this if I ever felt like that this Camp got to a spot to where it was not worth our support I would be the first one to withdraw from it I mean if you don't have one thing to worry about on that but as long as it goes in the direction of the message of the hour and the spirit of God moving in that direction I want to get behind him with all of my heart I think brother Tim is feeling sorry for me since I'm getting so old and can't hardly get around and all that stuff no more so he wanted to give me a couple more times to preach before I uh retire I guess you know but I'll have to say in the last couple years it's just been such a a wonderful experience and to see the lives of the kids that have been changed there and it makes it quite difficult for some of them because they come there and they feel the presence of God in a way that they've never felt it before and sad to say some of them go back to their home church and then they hear emotion hammered and they hear all this and that and the other hammered you ought to be so grateful that you attend a church that believes the scripture that we just read here I personally don't think that God wants to move one time a year and limit it to Dry Creek Louisiana I think he wants to move among us every time we come together myself don't you the only reason he doesn't move in a greater way I believe is because our expectation is not any higher I don't think any of us could ever go beyond what God wants to do Among Us great Supernatural phenomenal things many of you saw the ones that was prayed for of course the prayer line a couple hours long I don't even know how many people prayed for several hundred seem like some of them come through five or six times to me but naturally I was in the thick of it so it might seemed that way but the Lord did wonderful absolutely wonderful things I've already heard so many wonderful things that God did one one lady was there I heard about it today of a report from brother Timothy and the message was new relatively new to her and hadn't been married that long and she looked up on the platform and she nudged her husband and said you see them two angels standing up there and there was one on one side of brother Ron and one on the other side and they were kind of supporting him as he was preaching praise the Lord Hallelujah for those of you that were there and knew that there was a supernatural special something there but don't just limit it to Louisiana now because it ain't been that long ago one of the young sisters from our church saw an angel of the Lord stand on the platform in our church why shouldn't it be brother Branham said if you live close to God and you have the right type of homes the angels will visit your homes it don't have to be a church house it could be your house amen I believe myself that we are living in a great time amen I believe the Lord is going to manifest himself in a way that we've longed to see for a long long time I believe that with our young people that they should not be and I mentioned that to them in Louisiana they are not just the Church of tomorrow they're the Church of right now I love to see him sing don't you I love to see him play in musical instruments and clapping their hands and I love to see them sitting up here in the front I don't mind some of you Old-Timers setting up there with them but I love to see these young people up there in the front and worship in the Lord and praising the Lord I'm so grateful for that aren't you parents aren't your grandparents William Bachelor they're seeing them here than out shooting up in some kind of dope and drunk and and all that sort of thing huh I want to see him drunk all right but drunk on the Holy Ghost that's right so why should we as the older generation around this message why should we not want our children to have an ax to experience with God why should we not want them to see that he's the same yesterday today and forever that what he said in his word that he still does that as long as I'm your pastor here that's the way I'm going to preach it because that's the way I believe that the message come to restore our hearts back to the face of the original Apostolic fathers how many believe is it tonight with all your heart brother Rob brother Rob's gonna kind of help some of the youth here some of them didn't want to get up and testify they're a little bit nervous so I guess I've been nervous eliminate you from doing it I don't have to preach no more to them but I told Brother Rob if they felt nervous and didn't feel comfortable in doing it that maybe brother Rob could just read it for you but there's a few that I think wanted to maybe be able to do it but let me just tell you know we don't believe in women preachers so your sisters now you just keep it keep it keep it light you know so but I'm so grateful for what I see the Lord doing Among Us Friday morning Carol and I we stayed in DeRidder Louisiana at a hotel there so who he was coming out going to the service on Friday morning and I saw the bus setting over Todd Lowe's written on the side of it said gray on the address so I figured it's probably the one that brought our kids down so I walked over there and the bus driver started the bus and opened the door so I walked over to where he was and I said hey morning are you morning and he said y'all going to the camp of course he'd done seen my wife there long hair dress you know I said yes sir we are he said I brought a whole bus load of them kids down from Johnson City I said yes sir I know I'm their pastor he said I'm gonna tell you one thing them kids had Church praise the Lord I didn't tell him but I was thinking if you think they had it coming down you're in for it when they come back he said I've took groups all over everywhere I've drove all kinds of people to different things I have never enjoyed taking a group of people anywhere any better than I joined breaking them kids to Louisiana that makes me proud of you as your pastor not only that your conduct is good but that whether you're on a bus whether you're in Cracker Barrel or wherever you are that you're able to let your light shine from what I understand some of the people at Cracker Barrel they found out y'all was going to a camp so they want y'all to stop as you come back you stopped at Bucky's going down they wanted you to stop at Bucky's coming back you see you may think I'll never preach I may never prophesy but your light is shining how long does it take well how long does it take to turn a light on and it dispelled the darkness does it take a lot 48 hours to eliminate your bedroom your bathroom no as soon as you flip the switch whether or not you know it angels of the Lord are with God's people we're around it so much if we're not careful it'll become so common to us and we don't realize how blessed we are to be walking in the light amen let's just give them a nice hand tonight [Applause] all right everyone hello hello your hello all right this is one that she's not here today because she's not feeling well but she wanted to send this to send in this testimony this is uh Sister Chloe Dixon Friday I went up for prayer telling brother Timothy that Satan kept telling me I would never get the Holy Ghost and it was just impossible for someone like me Saturday night God revealed to me that I had the Holy Ghost I came home and my parents told me that I had no more fear or worry in my eyes okay I'm uh I'm sick right now because apparently Satan thinks that he can stop me but I know it just means he's mad because he knows he doesn't have power over me anymore praise the Lord Sister Chloe Dixon and uh so I want to I want to tell you this as far as on the camp it's something that brother Tony and first of all I want to thank all the the chaperones brother Tony and sister Jennifer brother uh hornyak John hornyak of course was wonderful uh sister Heidi don't know what we've done without you uh brother Jason that was great the gumbo was fantastic wherever he is um we had a wonderful time we've always had a wonderful time but brother we started uh talking and brother Tony mentioned to me he's like why do you do this and I had to think about it why do I do this and what came to me was the fact that I it's easy to love the children that is in me to love children and to want to spend time with and be with them and I recognize it as a massive privilege okay it is a privilege there was another brother as the prayer line was coming out there were brothers and sisters young brothers and sisters coming out and it's like I looked at him and I it struck me I get to be here I get to witness some of these things that are happening with God's people and I get to be part of it that that is such an awesome thing so I have enjoyed four years because I never had it as a child I've enjoyed for so many years being able to go to camp and spend these times and watch things these things happen some of the strongest experiences with the Lord that I have ever had and I think a lot of it is because of expectation you don't have to work and you go and you just dedicate that time to the Lord but I'm looking forward to tonight that we've not done this before because one of the things in my heart was that if they could only share with you what their experience is to share it with the rest of the body to encourage the body and let you know what it is that I have seen for years the the trip on being on the bus physically is tough I slept for I think three days and I'm still not caught up but it's worth it it is worth it and to get them tonight to be able to share some of their their thoughts and their experiences with you today is a joy to me to share that as I had a little boy in my in my dorm and we all went around we said where we were from and he I had the 14 year olds which was tougher than the 18 year olds but 14 year olds and and we asked I made them say well what their name was where were they from how many camps they've been to and who was their pastor and it came to me and I said in brother Donny's my pastor and we had the first night had opened up and it was just wide open the spirit was so strong it was wonderful if you got to check that service out and that little 14 year old said brother Donnie is your pastor and I'm like yeah because he had experienced the power of God go through that camp like he had never known anything before so I pray that it doesn't become common to you right that it should not ever be common okay okay now to the young people as I told you on the bus I know all of you have a testimony all of you have a testimony okay and I love you and you can stick your foot on the devil's neck as I told you and and really hit him in the in the nose and and punch him out by doing a testified experience here what you received in Camp but if you don't and you're not ready for that I love you anyway okay and it's a button you feed your experience so that's what we're looking to do all right so who's ready who's ready to give their testimony come on up come on up now here as she's coming up you all of you children are in a very safe place these people are filled with people that love you and this is your church family okay so I just want to start off by saying excuse the voice it's all from camp and also I just want to thank you brother Donnie for making us a way to go and brother Robin Sister Sarah and all the counselors but I'm just going to be honest here before I came to this Camp I was just struggling and I just felt like giving up at all the Lord brought me into a higher spot this past weekend and one thing God really spoke to me Saturday night was when brother Ron said to say out loud that you told that devil can't you tell that devil don't come back home they say it out loud your body obeys your confession like what brother Donnie has been preaching on and that whole service I felt from the beginning Satan was trying to take over and telling me I'm not gonna get any fit anything from this service but from just saying that confession out loud I felt a total peace and that thing totally left me the Satan was trying to bring on me and another thing God did for me was when I was in that prayer line the sister tells another sister that just start thanking God for everything before you even walk through it and that just helped me so much and I just started thanking the Lord for everything because Satan was trying to come back again trying to tell me you're not going to get anything from this prayer line but I just kept on singing to the Lord and thanking him because I knew I was going to get a breakthrough because Satan was telling me that and as I was walking through the prayer line they were singing the song Stay and I told the Lord please Lord stay I know you'll never leave me nor forsake me but just stay in my heart don't let it just be a camp experience and I was going through brothers were just saying bless her Lord and I was like Lord I just need something more than that some brother to just speak to my heart and I can't remember all the words brother Matthew McGarry said to me but something just came over me and I couldn't contain myself and I just started thanking the lord and like brother Donnie said in one of the services this past weekend that I got more at that campaign I got more at that camp more than just emotion but power and I believe that with my whole heart I did amen if you have a testimony why don't you come over here and sit in the front if you want to do that so just to testify before Louisiana can't Satan and try to bind me with a major complex in my life and as brother Donnie has taught us many times before when the devil lies to you sometimes you just need to open up your mouth and talk right back to him in the day before when we were leaving for Camp before I left to go to the bus the devil had been lying to me that whole time because those were shackles that I couldn't break on my own but I serve a God who has a promise that he will deliver me out of every trouble even complexes and so when he was saying all those things I took the time to go outside and I put him in his place and I said devil it don't matter what you say what matters is God's word is true and I will get the victory over you this weekend and I will not leave that camp with those same complexes and so I went in faith to that camp believing that God was going to touch me and Saturday the devil had been telling me that I wasn't going to get anything in that prayer line and I was going to walk through that platform and what nothing was going to happen and that I wasn't I was going to have those same complexes and I was just just give up just live with it but there was another report [Applause] and God said that he was going to do something amazing for me in that prayer line and that I was going to walk off that platform completely free and I believe that report and I walked through the prayer line just sincere and trusting the Lord and what he had promised and all of a sudden that dumb complex left my body and I know that I know that I know that is not coming back it's not welcomed in my heart anymore and the next thing that I knew God was I was slain in the spirit and just thanking God and I was carried into the back room foreign complex can't come back anymore I am a free woman [Music] praise the Lord not really sure what to say but I just want to give praise to the Lord last year I was really struggling in my Christian Mock and felt like Satan was really trying to grab a hold of my life and I felt like the Lord did a lot of good things for me I felt like the Lord filled me with the Holy Ghost last year and since that time things happened and found myself struggling again and beginning to doubt Lord did you really do for me what I thought you did and it's simple but all I have to say is I went to this camp and I was delivered from that and no matter what doubts that the devil may bring my way I know that I know that I know I have the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I just want to thank all the staff and the Lord for being there for me during Camp it has been an amazing opportunity it is my first Camp so it was kind of new to me to talk to the people and to Fellowship as much as I did I have been struggling with anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember I have shut my family out my church family I've shut God out and oh and I went to Camp I really believed that something was going to happen there that I was going to change thou I was going to hear God Saturday night was so special to me I went to that prayer line believing that I wasn't good enough believing that nothing was going to happen so something did God spoke to me for the first time he told me that I was good enough he told me that I am worth fighting for and I believe that I am good enough now I believe I'm worth fighting for and I know that he is greater than anxiety he is stronger than my fears and I am here today to testify to that I just want to thank him and praise him for everything that he's done for me thank you thank you [Applause] um so like Chloe I don't have much of a voice from Camp so just bear with me um my testimony starts actually the week before Camp when brother Aaron Oglesby was here that weekend all of his Services were just amazing and Saturday night in particular it spoke to me he'd been talking about clearing everything out of your life that was sin and I could hide it from everyone else but God would still know it was there at that point I knew it was in my life and what needed out so that night after the service I went up for prayer the desire for me the desire for it left me right then I knew I was free of it a couple days later it was time to go to camp and you know when you're surrounded by people that it's not as hard to fight the devil because they're all fighting with you and you're just you're not really thinking about it but that weekend at Camp the devil kept telling me that like you're not free you're gonna go home with that same thing and you're gonna fall right back into that sin well Friday afternoon they had a skit and then it forever changed my life it was about holding on the baggage and on the worldly peanuts you can't go into heaven with baggage one of the sisters played a role of a person that knew they were wrong and what what was in their life but they wasn't ready to give it up yet and when the time came to go into the Rapture she was still holding on to it the Rapture takes no baggage and she was left behind so the next night was the prayer line and the service from a few weeks ago that brother Donnie had preached came into my mind the service where he was talking about double slaying devils so I told the devil I said you're done right here tonight you was done last weekend but tonight is the night your head gets cut off I walked through that prayer line and I've never felt such an amount of freedom I came home and I've not had the desire for it since overall the Lord just took me and asked this question what in this world is worth being left behind and let me tell you there's nothing absolutely nothing I may have to fight to keep my ground but the freedom and joy and altogether assurance that I have is worth every battle so just thank you Lord amen so this was my first year and I was expecting a lot to happen so after the skit that they had it really touched me so when I was at the altar I was praying for the Holy Ghost to enter me after a few minutes of praying I felt something hit my heart and it was probably the best feeling I've ever had in my life and after that night I knew I was free Frozen [Applause] so this year Camp the lord gave me one of the best experiences in my life and I'm never going to forget it uh Friday night god Set Me Free he changed my life I felt like a new person Saturday night I went through the prayer line and I remember very clearly brother Tim saying he sees your desire I fell in the floor and they had to carry me to a chair and I'm sitting there for a little bit and a couple people were praying for me and so then I start to get up and go back to my seat and that's the thing I know I'm running around the building uh and now I can say without a doubt the lord gave me my desire and he filled me with the Holy Ghost I'm sitting on the back row and he almost hit me I thought I had something short but after all these that's in the typing I kept doing so it's a little bit longer but um I just really really appreciate being able to to do this and to testify and I think it helps me just thinking about it and instead of thinking in vague terms instead of like well yeah God moved or a lot you know it's just great I can think about really what God's done for us specifically so um so I've been to camp seven or eight times probably I think for to Louisiana camp but uh I just noticed and it impressed on me this year how unified it seemed like it was more than ever whether it was the counselors or the deacons or the first year Campers or everybody it was just much more it seemed even though everybody's you know it's always young everyone seemed mature and that was kind of the general attitude so one one night I don't remember which year which night it was brother Daryl Baxter and brother Tim Winters prayed with me and uh and I believe I was delivered of some some doubts and fears that I had um and then in the prayer line this year like I said I wanted to be specific and I'd heard on on tapes before where you know um brother Branham said you know tell God why you want to be healed or or or to speak like that so uh so I I asked God for a refilling of the Holy Ghost and a greater experience with God so that I could tell my family especially one or two specific people um what God's done for me um so God granted that request a lot of my family's hearing it right now but I may have to go out of my way for the rest um so uh both are both during the prayer line and Sunday morning are received a Special Touch from from God's presence and uh while Andrew Spencer was preaching on Sunday morning he looked at me and said come on brother Airwood God's on your side so I don't I really don't know I think it's about 50 50 on whether or not he knows my name so even if he actually even if he does know my name I still believe it was was God's leading for him to speak to me and that he has a plan and is on my side so even though I'm not as old as some people that went to camp and definitely not more mature I definitely got a blessing out of seeing the Lord work in every one pretty much every one of our kids uh Hearts this year you know so and I also wanted to say that I mean even if there's only five or six or seven that that say something right here I I think that everybody else should take notice to to everyone's lives later on and if you if you want to know ask somebody and I think they'd be willing to tell you because you know shyness is a lot of it and I don't think anybody anybody that went to camp and got something is ashamed they just you know just have different personalities so praise the Lord and I wanna I wanna thank you Paul for helping me on this trip Paul was a great assistance to me and he Brit role for everybody to make sure everybody got back on the bus we didn't leave anybody behind and you made it very easy on me and I thank you for that very very much uh all right is there any other testimonies that I missed absolutely well I went to this camp with um very high expectations and I knew exactly what I was going I was going for and um Satan you know I I went a day late but you know uh Satan kept trying and trying to hold me back and until you know tell me you're not going to get there you're not going to get there because I mean there were so many things that went on that you know just kept delaying and delaying me getting there but um I I uh I knew that I was going to get there and so if he was fighting me that hard I knew there was something in store um Saturday night the devil throughout the whole service just tried telling me um don't go through that prayer line there's no need there's no need I mean you don't need to go through it and um but right before the prayer line started brother Ron he said something he said young people come I'm getting into this line later when he said that I do I needed to go through that that's good but when I walked through that prayer line oh yeah someone pray the brothers started praying and uh and one Minister exactly prayed exactly when I was when I when I went through when I when I wanted and uh and right after that Lord I just I just felt something the Lord dropped the Holy Ghost into my heart I'll never be the same [Applause] praise the Lord [Applause] God bless y'all I try to be quick um so for myself my own personal testimony the first year I went was in 2018 and you know I was just 12 turning 13 don't know I know Jesus loves me but beyond that and I didn't really read my Bible or maybe some Sunday school stuff but um it was there at the camp I was uh I was thinking uh you know heard about getting baptized it sounds kind of fun there's a pool if I do it mom might like me a bit more you know and it was during the skit of that year I was sitting in the back of the church and it was called choosing Barabbas and the Lord just that was the first time he spoke to my heart and it was then and there at that camp as I wanted to be saved I fell in love with my Lord Jesus and I just said Lord I'm yours and from that year on here I still am you know no matter what's come they have already stopped me yet so I don't think he's going to but for uh for this year um I just uh was very had a very specific need in my heart for uh the prayer line and um you know sometimes uh if the devil can't get you one way then he wants to get your surroundings attack your family or just make sickness come whatever it be and we just spend going through some stuff as a family struggling and helping each other out and you know it's just tension builds and such and I went through that line and I said Lord you know you gave me the Holy Ghost I'm so grateful for it but I want my I want my brother and my sister to get it and I've been praying you know I see these young sisters come up here and they'll dance before they were in the worship I said I want my sister up there too and you know brother Donnie was talking about it doesn't have to be at a youth camp it doesn't have to be in a church it can be at your home if you invite him there it was 2 p.m this morning we were all gathered together at the kitchen table you know wasn't expecting this but I guess today was the day so we were just talking and praying and something real sweet came in my heart and I turned to my sister and I said are you saved she said yes the Lord's My Savior all right filled with the Holy Ghost she just starts breaking and the tears start trickling down and she's says no do you want it she says I want it I want it we all just as a family stood up and laid our hands on her and she she received it today and we testify of that [Music] [Applause] so it doesn't have to be in a church it doesn't have to be in a conventional setting you know if you call him on the scene he'll come some real that same sweet feeling just started feeling all of us I turned to my brother I said Joseph you want it to you he's starting to cry over there he that's what he was dead he rose up his head and said yes I want it too so I just want to say uh we have this uh plastered in our wall in the house as for me and my family we will serve the Lord and this day that scripture is fulfilled for our family God bless you [Applause] okay okay do we have anyone else oh all right is there anyone else you want now the biggest kid of all they Make Me Feel So Young I just want to compliment all your parents our pastor brother Rob Sister Sarah Tony and sister Jennifer mostly sister Jennifer sister Jennifer again Jason um I want you to know that you all have some if they're not your kids somehow you're related and uh it's a wonderful wonderful group of Youth and Young People they're Godly um brother Rob I don't I don't know of any circumstance I mean I've been going to camp for years I took a little break and I've gone back the last two or three years and um it's just uh harmonious everybody gets along real well there's a unity in our youth and um they love the Lord and I'm very proud of them and you should be too [Applause] I'm also pretty proud of that guy back there [Applause] we just uh the services were phenomenal um from day one it was like the Lord just pulling and pulling and pulling I mean they got a skit and and they're laughing and and it's funny but it's serious and we got an altar full um the Holy Spirit just let me put it to you like this Pentecost was not a day way back Pentecost didn't happen in 1903 Pentecost is present it's here it's now and if you don't want to partake you're not going to stop me you're not going to stop these young people Pentecostal speed and I'm not talking about the church I'm talking about an experience it's happened some of the kids you know you I hate to say it but you you say well this one man that one's looking for a boyfriend or looking for a girlfriend there was none of that I didn't get any kind of uh entertainment or whatever vibe from any of the kids they had one mind and they went on that bus they went to camp and our church joined up with brother Tim's church and brother uh brother Bennett's church and all these other little little groups and we joined together one mind and I'm telling you if you haven't watched those Services if you haven't streamed those services you're going to see that that one mind come together and God come down it was absolutely phenomenal I've been in a lot of services I've been in prayer lines before man just wow I'm Josiah wow wow I would ride 19 hours in a little bitty seat now to some of you it's not little bitty but to me it's a little bitty seat sleep on a itty bitty teeny weeny little mattress Council I think I had 15 16 year olds that have a lot of spirit but they were all good kids only had to threaten one or two of them I would do it all over again for just one of those services but I'm saying right now I don't have to go that far it can happen right here right now Pentecost is he praise the Lord it's wonderful anybody else all good all right I got two things to share if you remember we didn't have a bus okay the bus line that was going to has taken us for years no longer was going to take us so we were at the point we did not have a bus and I mentioned we need to pray about having a bus and the next day brother JD had some options so thank you for that because I'm not sure what we would have done about that it it turned out that the the gut the bus was the owner was a Christian and his bus drivers were Christians and in the first leg of the bus the owner of the bus was telling me about the Lord and I thought well this is going to be good okay so that was that was a huge blessing to us to be able to have a bust and to have Christian men that were taking us um myself on the prayer line I uh I wanted to go through the prayer line to go through quickly so that I could pray for kids as they were coming through and I put my arm I've been struggling my arm for uh since December I had heard it doing more than I should and working out and for some reason it just took he I don't know what happened but both of my arms went straight up like almost unnaturally straight up like pulled up and I came out of that and I feel great so that was months and months and months so I'm feeling good thank God for that and uh and there were many uh many children also that maybe didn't want to come up tonight that had mentioned on the bus how they'd received the Holy Ghost that was that was tremendous to hear one after another it was a multitude of children saying that they had received the Holy Ghost and one after another after another after another because the expectation was so strong in their peers when and they respond they know how to worship they get up and I was as we're sitting in the back they had the adults sit in the back and we watched the kids and I was like oh I know that kid and I know that kid and I know that kid it's our kids not that others don't have kids that are wonderful as well but it was something really to watch them and that's the privilege and the last thing that I thought and it came out during the services is to recognize the fact that um our children are part of the Queen of Heaven and that they are the final voice to this age and they are maturing that's take account of that they are maturing fast as the scripture declares that they must to get to where they need to be that we all can go home God bless you all thank you I wonder what the first century Christians they had young people too brother John imagine how they would gather together several share today brother Ken ball on different ones it's been around for a long long time brother Byron Palmer and for the Harvey Lunsford different ones that probably never even got to attend a youth service myself the first youth service I ever attended I preached it I never had a use later never had one never went to a gift Camp never had a youth service at all but I know that there's one thing I think all of us desire for our children and that is that they can meet the Lord Jesus in such a real way that no matter what they ever face in life they'll be able to face it with him let me just say this for those of you that God did something for you you know already Satan will do his best to take it from you if you stood up and you testified you already know he's going to attack you but that's all right you just attack him back you just stand your ground as his brother Ron preached it on Saturday night we are warriors we are not on a picnic we're here in a war and we are going to win this war by the grace of God let's bow our heads together if you would heavenly father thank you for this tonight Lord mother Rob told me today that several of the kids was testifying on the bus coming back that they'd received the Holy Ghost I thought Lord what a wonderful thing to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the whole trip the whole Camp all the preparation all the effort that was put forth would be worse to do it all for one much less for multiple and this is just our church tonight so how many have went to Arizona and back to Ohio to Indiana and all different parts and they're sharing what you've done for them we thank you for it father I pray for brother Tim Lord in this church I know it's been a big sacrifice for them for all these years I thank you for putting it on their hearts years ago to be able to do this I'm sure he didn't have a clue how it would be and how that it would touch so many kids around the world father we're just asking in the name of Jesus if there's one of ours here that could not go I know some wanted to and they were sick different things happened they couldn't go but may the same Holy Ghost come by this way tonight father we don't have to we don't want to have to wait till Camp next year we may not even be here next year but may the spirit of God come by this way Lord fill every Hungry Heart to this place we know Lord It's not that we have to be in Louisiana we don't have to be in Washington DC here we don't have to be in Jeffersonville the thing of it is our hearts have to be in the right position Lord Jesus I send you heal so many that are Saturday night your presence so wonderful but we got sick for cure tonight I pray Lord God In The Name of Jesus while we're praying May the angels of the Lord go amongst your children right now you delivered those of discouragement sadness and depression well there's people here tonight that may be feeling the same way but we believe you're the same yesterday today and forever we love you father we bring our needs before you now God and we ask you that you would help us Lord can we stand our feet and he has a need and you're allowed to be remembered tonight before the Lord God bless you yes thank you so much for praying for Erica we're so appreciated I'm sure most of you know that she contacted shingles this past week everything else she was dealing with she sure didn't need that but the Lord's been merciful to her and helped her and she's feeling better today and we're sorry to thank you for praying for her but she still needs a touch from the Lord she still hasn't got her appetite back she's down to about 101 pounds something like that and certainly needs to to be able to get that back and he believes with us that God's going to take care of that how many of you have a need in your body your home your life whatever it is would you just lay your hand on that person standing by you now we've heard our use and brother Rob and brother John testify of some of the things that they did and some of the things that they saw and some of the ones they witnessed to and we out and already know what our God can do but let's just call him on the scene right here tonight his presence is here you know what you recognize it he's here right now Hallelujah father in the name of Jesus we agree together now Lord touching the needs of your children not only those in the visible audience but those that are streaming maybe some in the bed sick Lord I know different ones dealing with the stomach virus and this and that and the other couldn't be a church tonight I heard from several today may your presence go right there to their home in the name of Jesus May that evil thing leave him dear God we agree together as your children we believe the scripture that we heard read when we first opened your word Lord these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils Satan in the name of Jesus take your hand off of God's people we have a Bill of Rights given to us by almighty God every promise that's made as Believers it has our name on it in the name of Jesus take your hands off of them may sickness leave them may oppression leave them father may you touch your children Lord God we agree together tonight on the promise of your word Lord Jesus we're just asking that you would help us father stir our hearts stir Our Lives we need you a lot never before Lord we thank you for every young person that got touched Lord there in Louisiana Lord we can't keep from being just a little bit partial we're just so glad you touched the ones of our church they're special to us Lord I pray father for those that couldn't go Lord Jesus may they not feel left out tonight but may you touch them right now while we're in your presence or dear God I pray the presence of the holy spirit will just come Among Us Lord O Lord God that great awesome presence as we went off the platform that's Saturday night and went back into the room the Lord with some ministers and the deacons and your presence common such an awesome way Lord I don't think I'll ever forget it Carol told me she said I've I've sensed the presence of God since I was just a teenager but she said when I walked up on that platform I sent something like I had never sensed before so we're talking about
