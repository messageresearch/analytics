[27:04] I was going to go and I'd Centro
[27:06] Michaels some pictures and some things
[27:09] that we was gonna look at
[27:11] but for those of you the others had
[27:13] sisters safe in his funeral last night a
[27:16] total little story I know shared again
[27:19] tonight with those who there wasn't
[27:20] there
[27:22] Tuesday morning I was awakened early
[27:26] before daylight and I just been praying
[27:28] that the Lord would give me the words to
[27:32] say that would be an encouragement to
[27:34] her family and something that would
[27:36] helps them and
[27:38] the Lord spoke three words to my heart
[27:42] and that was mercy walked in
[27:46] so that's what I spoke about last night
[27:49] and since Tuesday since that happened to
[27:53] me Tuesday I've
[27:55] I've just not been able to get over
[27:58] those words just that is you know it is
[28:03] sometimes the Lord just inspires your
[28:05] heart too
[28:08] so we've got a little bit of change
[28:10] tonight in the direction we're going to
[28:12] go
[28:15] we'll resume the heavens and the stars
[28:17] maybe next week
[28:19] for those of you that were in the
[28:21] funeral service last night you will hear
[28:24] a little bit of what you heard last
[28:25] night but it was a condensed
[28:28] watered-down shallow form that has to be
[28:32] said of course for people who don't
[28:34] understand what we understand but even
[28:37] at that he walked in a
[28:40] man his presence was certainly there
[28:44] so I want to speak to you tonight on
[28:46] mercy walked in
[28:50] Genesis chapter 1 verse 2
[28:58] and the earth was without form and void
[29:04] and darkness was upon the face of the
[29:07] deep
[29:08] the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
[29:12] the waters and God said
[29:16] let there be light and there was light I
[29:21] mean I'd like to be remembered tonight

[30:48] may mercy walk it Lord God I pray
[30:53] Heavenly Father though our needs are
[30:56] many and great our God is greater
[30:59] than our needs
[31:01] we bring all these to you tonight Lord
[31:04] Jesus I sent here tonight I'm sure the
[31:07] most needy
[31:09] father God and a man to try to stand and
[31:13] speak the words of God the words of life
[31:17] what a notable task it is
[31:20] help me Jesus
[31:23] Lord I've been speaking since I was just
[31:26] an 18 year old boy but it still scares
[31:28] me and frightens me I
[31:30] think the older I get my dependency upon
[31:33] you it's great or and I feel less
[31:36] capable than I've ever felt in my life
[31:39] help me Jesus
[31:44] help me that I can get out of the way
[31:46] I'm a mercy walk-in
[31:49] speak to us tonight your word father in
[31:53] the name of the Lord Jesus we ask
[31:56] the Saints said
[31:58] amen god bless you you may be seated
[32:13] I don't know exactly
[32:16] how cold it was
[32:20] the darkness must have been so dense and
[32:23] so thick
[32:25] there was no light
[32:28] no cosmic rays
[32:31] no sunshine that was able to penetrate
[32:34] the earth
[32:35] if there was a division between
[32:38] day and night darkness and leg
[32:42] I'm not sure that it was even where you
[32:45] could tell it
[32:47] because it's so covered the earth and it
[32:51] was so sick
[32:53] we know it hadn't always been this way
[32:56] but something had happened from verse 1
[33:00] to verse 2 and had brought this change
[33:03] upon the earth so we know that in the
[33:06] beginning God created the heavens and
[33:07] the earth period the Prophet said it
[33:10] could have been millions of years and
[33:11] then when we resumed that scripture we
[33:14] look in verse 2 and see that the earth
[33:17] was without form we know in Isaiah that
[33:19] he said he did not make the earth to be
[33:22] formless but he created it to be
[33:25] inhabited so something had happened in
[33:28] this pre-adamite world was it a domain
[33:32] that had been given to Lucifer and
[33:34] through his deceit and through his pride
[33:37] and arrogance the judgment of God had
[33:40] stricken it to such a place the
[33:43] scripture of course is silent but we
[33:46] know that God was not willing to let it
[33:50] stay in this kind of a place
[33:54] so mercy walked in
[33:58] mercy has many different ways
[34:02] by which the Almighty chooses to reveal
[34:06] mercy
[34:08] sometimes mercy is made manifest
[34:12] invisible signs and wonders
[34:15] sometimes it's actually veiled in humans
[34:20] sometimes it might come in something
[34:23] that would seem to be a
[34:26] negative saying but yet God's mercy
[34:29] whether it's revealed in mysterious form
[34:33] or in a very simplified form it'll
[34:37] always benefit those who receive it
[34:41] you and I certainly have to take Moses
[34:45] word
[34:45] huming the only one that was able to
[34:49] write about this instance quite this
[34:51] plain but we know enough about the
[34:55] character of God to see that mercy
[34:58] walked in my mind leaves from there and
[35:03] will move in time several thousand years
[35:09] after this instance of mercy we will
[35:13] move beyond the loneliness of man's
[35:18] primeval days on the earth will move
[35:22] past his time with God alone
[35:27] to his state after God had given him a
[35:34] helpmate and that helped meat being made
[35:38] inferior to him
[35:40] following the inclination of her flesh
[35:43] her reasoning her ability to sink and
[35:47] listening to the devil
[35:49] this man then must make a choice of what
[35:54] he will do
[35:56] the judgment of God could have justly
[36:00] come down to the Garden of Eden God
[36:04] could have once straight to the bush
[36:06] where Adam and Eve were hidden he could
[36:10] have come right behind the bush and
[36:12] pointed his finger and said I am going
[36:17] to destroy you
[36:18] you disobeyed my word
[36:21] you directly went opposite of what I
[36:26] told you
[36:27] Genesis 3:8 says and they heard the
[36:30] voice of the Lord God walking in the
[36:34] garden in the cool of the day and Adam
[36:36] and his wife hid themselves
[36:39] from the presence of the Lord God
[36:42] amongst the trees of the garden and the
[36:45] Lord God called on the Adam and said
[36:48] unto Him where art thou and he said I
[36:52] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[36:55] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[37:00] myself
[37:01] o
[37:01] God what are you going to do
[37:04] this is your first son he's rebelled
[37:09] he's chosen his own way over your way
[37:13] his nature and this has now fallen he's
[37:18] going to blame you God for giving him
[37:20] this wife he will not even have a
[37:23] repentant attitude you know this already
[37:26] you know that he will not even admit to
[37:29] his full guilt you know what he has done
[37:32] he is not even not knowledgeable yet to
[37:35] know millions and millions of
[37:38] inhabitants on the earth yet even
[37:40] billions will suffer because of this
[37:44] decision what will you render to him oh
[37:47] just God Almighty 1 what will you render
[37:52] to this man because of this decision
[37:56] that he has made
[37:58] verse 21 tells us unto Adam also and to
[38:04] his wife
[38:06] did the Lord God
[38:08] make coats of skins and
[38:12] clothed them
[38:14] why
[38:15] mercy walk did
[38:20] justice judgment righteousness all of
[38:24] that could have come he could have
[38:26] called them out from behind the bushes
[38:28] where they were hid in the naked state
[38:31] their trembling and shaking because they
[38:34] heard the voice of God and now their
[38:36] senses and let them know right and wrong
[38:39] and they were now in this state to where
[38:42] they felt so ashamed not so much the
[38:45] shame of their sin but ashamed other
[38:47] nakedness God could have walked down the
[38:50] garden with fiery eyes he would have
[38:53] want with gentlemen to execute judgment
[38:55] upon them but instead
[38:58] mercy
[39:00] mercy what if a
[39:05] friend I'll tell you tonight the more I
[39:08] look at it the more I realize the
[39:11] greatest times in my life and mercy has
[39:13] come my way it wasn't that I was worthy
[39:16] it wasn't that I deserved it really I
[39:19] deserved a whippin I deserved a rebuke I
[39:22] deserve something you understand what
[39:24] I'm saying God's mercy doesn't always
[39:27] come to us and we're so gentle and so
[39:30] kind and so sweet but when we need it
[39:33] most as when he does it best and it may
[39:37] be what others would saying all my I
[39:39] think of how that people have thrown us
[39:41] off and written us off and yet the mercy
[39:44] and the love of God goes beyond even
[39:46] sometimes when our friends would give to
[39:49] us and many times even what we would
[39:52] give ourselves you remember the story of
[39:54] David when the Prophet came to him and
[39:57] told him about how that the man had come
[39:59] in and wanted to feed his guests and he
[40:02] said well take his neighbor's lamb and
[40:04] feed him the righteous teaching of David
[40:07] the righteous thing that was in him said
[40:10] let this man die and the Prophet comes
[40:12] riding around and said you are the man
[40:15] all we know how that is we can stand on
[40:18] our righteousness when we think we're
[40:21] not to blame and we can pronounce
[40:23] judgment on this one and that one in the
[40:25] other one and sometimes we're just as
[40:28] long as they are only in different
[40:30] avenues but aren't you glad that God
[40:33] doesn't use your own mouth and shut you
[40:36] by the way you sometimes judge others
[40:39] but what does he do mercy will walk in
[40:42] and move upon your heart and forgive you
[40:46] even though you're not forgiving others
[40:49] in
[40:51] the days of Noah the world had got so
[40:55] horrible in the darkness and moved upon
[40:57] the face of the earth and the spiritual
[40:59] condition and moved upon the man to
[41:02] where
[41:03] God's Word said this in Genesis 66 it
[41:06] repented the Lord that had made man on
[41:08] the earth and it grieved him at his
[41:12] heart and the Lord said I will destroy
[41:15] man whom I have created from the face of
[41:18] the earth both man and beast and the
[41:21] creeping thing and the fowls of the air
[41:23] for it repenteth me that I have made
[41:26] them OMA but here is what God is going
[41:31] to do in the seperation between verse 7
[41:34] and verse 8 but Noah found grace in the
[41:39] eyes of the Lord what happened before
[41:42] the flood came upon the earth mercy
[41:46] walked in to Noah's life and gave him a
[41:51] dispensation
[41:52] revelation that God was fixin to change
[41:55] the course of the world this time it was
[41:59] not mercy coming in the form of a man
[42:02] this time it was not God Himself walking
[42:05] in the form of theophany but it was
[42:08] mercy a man that come in the form of a
[42:12] revelation and that revelation was
[42:16] consistent was the Word of God for the
[42:18] hour in so much that the revelation was
[42:21] the Word of God for the hour and mercy
[42:25] walked in
[42:26] holliday a mercy walked in what may know
[42:31] it different from everybody else we know
[42:33] I'm reading about Noah even after the
[42:35] flood that Noah got out and got drunk
[42:37] truly nor was a man that was above the
[42:40] others but he had his problems I hope
[42:42] you can appreciate me tonight God's
[42:44] grace has called us out from Laodicea
[42:47] God's grace has filled us with the Holy
[42:50] Ghost God has opened our hearts to his
[42:53] word but we've still got our problems
[42:56] we've still got our humanity we've still
[42:59] got our shortcomings but what was it
[43:02] that brought God to us mercy walked in
[43:05] it was not because you were good I was
[43:09] good I was worthy it was because mercy
[43:13] came to us in a revelation of the last
[43:16] day of a message that the majority of
[43:18] the world has turned down and rejected
[43:23] [Applause]
[43:24] but mercy mercy
[43:28] walked in what I say walked in don't get
[43:32] in your mind that it's always a man on
[43:35] two legs sometimes it is but many times
[43:38] mercy comes in a mysterious form here
[43:41] the very thing that opened up Noah's
[43:43] hard to be quickened to receive what God
[43:46] was doing in that day not only Noah but
[43:49] the damned animals out there Noah
[43:50] couldn't speak camel language he
[43:53] couldn't speak donkey language he
[43:55] couldn't speak elephant language and
[43:57] giraffe language but the Spirit of God
[43:59] moved upon their hearts what was it
[44:01] while the Holy Ghost moving down through
[44:03] the garden or wherever they was out in
[44:06] the field and pulling out two cows and
[44:08] two giraffes and two monkeys and two
[44:10] baboon and two rhinoceros and whatever
[44:13] more what was it mercy walked in among
[44:16] them mercy of God can call on a dumb
[44:19] elephant can't God move on us dummies
[44:22] [Applause]

[45:34] walked into this dispensation and open
[45:37] our understanding to be able to see and

[45:54] will all families of the earth be
[45:56] blessed what was it that happened to
[45:59] this man mercy walked in mercy walked in
[46:04] oh my think of it now as him and Sarah
[46:08] they were all in there her womb was
[46:10] barren and his strength was gone in
[46:13] Genesis chapter 18 verse 1 and the Lord
[46:16] appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre
[46:19] and he said in the tent door in the heat
[46:21] of the day amen and they were beyond
[46:25] childbearing they would be islands seem
[46:27] like the promise of God but mercy what
[46:31] is this hallelujah this time mercy I
[46:36] picked up a body down on the road God
[46:39] and two angels come right down the road
[46:41] and the prophet said he took them 16
[46:44] elements and blew a body and an angel
[46:47] stepped into it and you blew another and
[46:49] he blew himself one what was it mercy
[46:52] walked into Abraham's tent Lord God

[47:27] he lifts up his eyes and looked and lo
[47:32] three
[47:33] men stood by him and when he saw them he
[47:39] ran to meet them from the tent door and
[47:41] bowed himself toward the ground and said
[47:43] my lord
[47:47] my lord
[47:49] he saw three but he knew this only one
[47:55] my lord why mercy walked into his scent
[48:00] you can't hide God from the elect it
[48:03] makes no difference what for me
[48:04] manifests himself and they may stand
[48:06] around a little bit for a while and then
[48:08] they have to pray about it look at it
[48:09] but you cannot hide God from the elected

[48:14] best to keep God away from us but he

[54:44] I hope you understand I'm fixing to say
[54:46] that mercy seat in heaven has never
[54:48] changed exactly it's always been in
[54:50] heaven but on the earth it changes
[54:53] locations
[54:54] well if it's a god it has changed
[54:58] locations from time to time from
[55:00] dispensation to dispensation come on
[55:03] Judith when the breach is opened up and
[55:05] manifesting can't you see why that God
[55:08] in the tight Esther became the mercy

[55:23] the prayer through you
[55:28] you might be there merci
[55:31] [Applause]
[55:37] merci
[55:39] walked him to Sodom
[55:43] in the form of
[55:46] German
[55:55] I'm gonna bring it down past here
[55:57] angelic realm tonight so hope it don't
[56:00] shake
[56:03] but missus walked reject it miss and
[56:09] turn to what a pillar of salt why she
[56:14] rejected mercy and her husband had no
[56:18] covenant with God so God could kill his
[56:21] wife but
[56:24] God couldn't kill Abraham's wife well
[56:27] full mercy under the atonement of the
[56:31] Covenant was with Abraham
[56:34] humor
[56:36] what Abraham being a good man a great
[56:38] man a prophet of God but Abraham had his
[56:41] problems Abraham had his issues honey
[56:44] can be honest and I'd say I'm him and I
[56:46] get issues
[56:47] that's right Abraham lied about his wife
[56:50] when he goes down of course into the
[56:52] land it's Genesis chapter 20 verse 3 but
[56:54] God came to Abimelech in a dream by
[56:56] night and said to him behold behold
[56:59] Howard but a dead man for the woman
[57:01] Marcellus taken she is a man's wife but
[57:04] Abdul Malik had not come near to her and
[57:07] he said Lord wilt thou slay also a
[57:09] righteous nation
[57:11] said he not unto me she is my sister and
[57:14] she even she herself said he is my
[57:18] brother in the integrity of my heart and
[57:22] innocency of my hands have I done this
[57:25] and
[57:27] God said unto Him in a dream yeah I know
[57:30] that thou did assist in the integrity of
[57:33] thy heart also was healthy from sinning
[57:36] against me therefore suffered are they
[57:38] not to touch her
[57:40] I thought restore the man his wife
[57:44] for he yes a prophet
[57:53] so a back slid profit has more sway with
[57:56] God than a righteous King which hasn't
[57:59] even done wrong
[58:06] come on take your hands and it'll help
[58:08] you get it then
[58:10] restores a man his wife for he is a
[58:13] proper how could that be
[58:15] mercy walked into Abraham's life and
[58:18] even when Abraham was wrong he's gonna
[58:21] pay for his wrong it ain't gonna say the
[58:23] cheering you're gonna do wrong and you
[58:25] buy with it cuz you're not but just
[58:26] because you do wrong does not mean that
[58:29] he loses his ownership of who you are
[58:32] Lord said if you could understand it
[58:35] mercy walked into your soul before you
[58:37] was ever a mortal being mercy walked
[58:40] into your name and wrote your name
[58:42] associated with him I'm the Lamb's Book
[58:45] of Life before the foundation of the
[58:46] world oh mercy done in time was connect
[58:50] what mercy depleted to you or give to
[58:52] you before the world ever began
[59:01] now therefore restore the man his wife
[59:05] for he is a prophet and he shall pray
[59:09] for thee
[59:12] and thou shalt live
[59:15] you're a good hold on this man you're a
[59:18] good Methodist you're a good Baptist
[59:19] fella
[59:23] but I'll walk was this man I
[59:26] eat lunch with this guy
[59:30] whether not you like him mother not you
[59:32] say man he was one of God's picks
[59:36] [Applause]
[59:41] as far as a good man a man of integrity
[59:44] a man of honor a man of character a bit
[59:46] more equals a good man seemingly better
[59:48] bevel I didn't have the cabinet
[59:51] Massey had not walked into a Bimala soul
[59:54] and the dispensation of truths allied of
[59:57] God was on Abraham and even though
[59:59] Abraham wouldn't worry needed to be
[1:00:01] mercy never left him
[1:00:05] mercy walked in
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:13] he shall pray for then thou shalt live
[1:00:16] if thou restore her not all your ties
[1:00:20] are your offerings or the churches you
[1:00:22] build all the preaching you do and
[1:00:24] everything else you do thou shalt surely
[1:00:26] die
[1:00:28] thou and all that are resigned
[1:00:35] so whether or not he lives is based upon
[1:00:38] height reached this prophet and his
[1:00:39] message
[1:00:43] why mercy walked into this man's life
[1:00:46] mercy walked in Abraham wasn't even
[1:00:49] looking for Abraham was not even asking
[1:00:51] for we didn't know how to ask for this
[1:00:53] brother Rob many of you was Baptist
[1:00:55] Methodist Pentecostal whatever you were
[1:00:56] and many of you were happy oh there was
[1:00:58] something down inside of you that longed
[1:01:00] for more but there was many of us that
[1:01:02] was happy where we were but there was
[1:01:04] some down inside of us that little Eagle
[1:01:06] of a seed it was reaching out it was
[1:01:09] screaming it was crying for something
[1:01:11] else what was it mercy walked into you
[1:01:14] and you took the breath of life you
[1:01:16] didn't even know God had mercy you
[1:01:18] didn't even know but when you took the
[1:01:20] breath of life that representation mercy
[1:01:23] walked into you
[1:01:25] [Applause]
[1:01:35] Abraham is on Mount Moriah
[1:01:39] his son is laying on the altar
[1:01:42] his hands are bound
[1:01:44] his feet are bound
[1:01:47] the knife is in his hand
[1:01:49] he's fixin to take his life within
[1:01:52] seconds it'll be finished
[1:01:58] but mercy walked in
[1:02:03] in the form of a ram
[1:02:19] genesis 22 11 in the age of the Lord
[1:02:21] called unto Him out of heaven and said
[1:02:23] Abraham Abraham they said here am i Hani
[1:02:26] said lay not thine hand upon the lad
[1:02:27] neither do thou anything of the humor
[1:02:30] now I know that thou fearest God seeing
[1:02:32] that thou hast not withheld Dassin
[1:02:36] notice how the angel deals with it as if
[1:02:38] though brother David he went ahead and
[1:02:40] sacrificed him
[1:02:43] why because in his heart he did
[1:02:52] because seeing thou hast not withheld
[1:02:54] thy son thine only son for me and
[1:02:58] Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:03:01] and behold behind him a ram
[1:03:07] caught in a thicket
[1:03:09] by his
[1:03:12] not his feet
[1:03:15] the horns in the church ages represent
[1:03:18] the church
[1:03:20] it was us who called Christ our Aries a
[1:03:24] ram in the thicket
[1:03:28] it was our knee
[1:03:30] our Dyer say that we were in clover the
[1:03:35] dog
[1:03:37] mercy
[1:03:46] after Jacob but soul and his brothers
[1:03:49] verse night
[1:03:50] deceived his blind daddy I
[1:03:54] imagine there must have been an element
[1:03:56] of feeling sad and feeling sorrow even
[1:03:58] if it wasn't just for being caught
[1:04:00] because Jacob at this time was certainly
[1:04:03] a rotten fella
[1:04:05] but election and walked into Jacob
[1:04:08] before Jacob knew this thing about
[1:04:09] election
[1:04:11] hang with me tonight election walked
[1:04:14] into you before you even believed in
[1:04:15] election election believed in you before
[1:04:18] it believed in it God believed in you
[1:04:20] before you believed in God God had a
[1:04:23] hold on you before you ever thought you
[1:04:25] got a whole ton God oh one day and I'm
[1:04:28] gonna hold him out rather than this any
[1:04:29] other woman said that's not even
[1:04:31] scriptural man don't even seek God as
[1:04:33] God seeking man
[1:04:35] notice in Genesis 28 10 and sheikha
[1:04:38] Pinal from Beersheba and one toward
[1:04:41] Haran is going now of course leaving his
[1:04:43] father's house to find a wife and he
[1:04:45] lied it upon a certain place and tarried
[1:04:47] there all night because the Sun was set
[1:04:49] and he took her the stones of that place
[1:04:51] and put them for his pillows and laid
[1:04:53] down on the place to sleep and he
[1:04:55] dreamed and behold a letter set upon the
[1:04:59] earth and the top of it reached to
[1:05:01] heaven and behold the angels of God
[1:05:04] ascending and descending on it what was
[1:05:08] it mercy walked in to a deceiver a liar
[1:05:13] a man who had put on a costume and went
[1:05:17] in and deceived his blind daddy that
[1:05:19] he'll not be able to get the best luck
[1:05:20] oh brother Donnie he was going to get it
[1:05:22] that's right but it was never God's Way
[1:05:24] for him to get it that way I don't know
[1:05:26] what God would have done but it would
[1:05:27] have never been through deceit I believe
[1:05:30] he would have wound up with her somehow
[1:05:32] but the devil absolutely made him jump
[1:05:35] ahead of the program of God as he does
[1:05:37] us many times he'll try to get us ahead
[1:05:40] of the program of God and you imagine
[1:05:42] Jacob Devils is his entire life but
[1:05:45] instead of God leaving him there and say
[1:05:46] you rotten thing I don't want nothing to
[1:05:49] do with you I'll have nothing to deal
[1:05:51] with you mercy walked in in the form of
[1:05:53] a dream when God let down a ladder and
[1:05:56] he hooked the top part of that ladder up
[1:05:58] in heaven who was that ladder it was the
[1:06:01] Lamb of God and mercy won't ride into
[1:06:04] Jacobs dream
[1:06:08] mas I walked into Jacob sub-conscience
[1:06:16] mercy
[1:06:21] the angels of God ascending and
[1:06:24] descending on it and behold the Lord
[1:06:26] stood above it and said I am the Lord
[1:06:29] God of Abraham thou father and the god
[1:06:32] of Isaac the land whereon thou liest to
[1:06:35] thee will I give it and to thy seed
[1:06:38] verse 16 and Jacob await out of his
[1:06:42] sleep and said surely the capital L
[1:06:45] capital o capital R capital D is in this
[1:06:50] place
[1:06:53] mercy
[1:06:59] to a humble man to a man that was worthy
[1:07:02] to a man that was so kind and so gentle
[1:07:06] a man that had been so persecuted and
[1:07:08] man that had lived such a godly life
[1:07:10] come on children to a man that most
[1:07:12] people wouldn't even give him the time
[1:07:14] of day but mercy walked in because in
[1:07:17] this man was something that God could
[1:07:20] change you see we look at people and we
[1:07:22] judge them but to what they are today or
[1:07:24] what they've been for the last five or
[1:07:26] six years in you and I do not know
[1:07:28] within twenty minutes from now they
[1:07:31] could be a changed person think while
[1:07:33] all it takes his mercy to walk you and
[1:07:36] be able to strike and then the right way
[1:07:38] you think Jacob hadn't heard all this
[1:07:40] teacher I mentioned it to you when C not
[1:07:42] the Apostles had said under the very
[1:07:44] teaching of the Son of God himself but
[1:07:46] that teaching of the Son of God could
[1:07:48] not burst them along they knew they
[1:07:51] shouldn't lie they knew they should
[1:07:52] stand for him but the doctrine of the
[1:07:54] teaching of the Son of God could not
[1:07:56] keep their had had to be the Son of God
[1:07:58] in the form of the Holy Ghost living
[1:08:00] inside of their soul once that car had
[1:08:03] changed some forever
[1:08:09] he was afraid and said how dreadful is
[1:08:12] this place this is none other
[1:08:15] but the house of God
[1:08:18] this is great
[1:08:24] what happened girl
[1:08:26] merci
[1:08:33] Jacob was gonna meet Esau
[1:08:35] Genesis 32 24
[1:08:38] Jacob was left alone
[1:08:43] and there wrestled a
[1:08:48] man was him until the breaking of the
[1:08:52] day
[1:08:54] what's coming what is set in the bushes
[1:08:56] see the shadows Jacob is scared not
[1:09:01] really certain what he saw was gonna do
[1:09:02] what's gonna be was response how is he
[1:09:05] going to trade him he said he saw he
[1:09:08] sees so sneaked up across the river
[1:09:09] there the forge a buck as he saw coming
[1:09:12] up to the bushes what is it now we are
[1:09:14] it not time
[1:09:16] something doesn't look scared out during
[1:09:18] the day you go there in the night and
[1:09:19] sounds and that sounds it's all more
[1:09:21] peculiar and strange to us your imagine
[1:09:24] him is this Aaron is out praying and
[1:09:25] he's going to ask God for help him and
[1:09:27] God to be merciful all the sudden
[1:09:29] something shaken the regress something
[1:09:33] moving I said he saw
[1:09:34] this house that you
[1:09:38] I'll take him for sending there
[1:09:40] trembling all of a sudden somebody
[1:09:41] reaches over and grabs a hold of him
[1:09:43] against him in a headlock
[1:09:46] Levi's daughter
[1:09:48] it wasn't he saw it was mercy
[1:09:53] glory to God
[1:09:55] a
[1:09:55] [Applause]
[1:09:58] saw
[1:09:59] it was mercy
[1:10:03] but mercy had to put the squeeze on him
[1:10:06] mercy had to work him over a little bit
[1:10:08] don't give up on your children don't
[1:10:10] give up on your husband
[1:10:19] but this time mercy come in like a sumo
[1:10:24] wrestler
[1:10:29] and grab the whole again lock it into
[1:10:32] British press 3:20
[1:10:34] his arms that big around
[1:10:39] scrubby's old hair
[1:10:48] it might not have felt like mercy
[1:10:52] our Badger and the Jews did not feel
[1:10:54] like it was a tender hand of Jehovah
[1:10:56] when I comment and Stalin and muscle in
[1:10:58] he was doing what they were but you and
[1:11:00] I know it was the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:11:02] driving them back to what they needed to
[1:11:05] be
[1:11:07] how do you know sometimes when you get
[1:11:09] sick and afflicting you go through a
[1:11:10] terrible trial it's not the mercy of God
[1:11:13] letting something come upon you in order
[1:11:15] to bring out a character out of you that
[1:11:17] you yourself didn't even know that was
[1:11:18] there all I know we prefer all the
[1:11:21] healing and the signs and the miracle
[1:11:22] but I'm telling your friend those things
[1:11:24] sometimes mercy has to do this go to
[1:11:26] hurt us
[1:11:32] the wrestled and banlist him unto the
[1:11:34] breaking of the day you believe what you
[1:11:37] want I don't believe this man had wings
[1:11:38] I
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:41] don't think Jacob but a very kay Dome of
[1:11:44] the sky brothers Jim if he reached up
[1:11:46] and grabbed ahold of a feather
[1:11:51] it was mercy in the form of a wrestler
[1:11:57] pretty good one at that
[1:12:00] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[1:12:02] against him he touched the hollowly side
[1:12:04] and the Hollow Jacob Psalm was out of
[1:12:07] joint
[1:12:08] Jacob was a pretty good rafter himself
[1:12:11] as he wrestled with him and he said let
[1:12:14] me go for the day breakers and he said I
[1:12:16] will not I
[1:12:20] will not let thee go except thou bless
[1:12:23] me
[1:12:26] but this time he was convinced he wasn't
[1:12:29] from Japan but this time he was
[1:12:32] convinced he wasn't from the American
[1:12:34] wrestlers associations whoever this
[1:12:37] being was he had access to blessings and
[1:12:40] Jacob needed what he had hey man so now
[1:12:44] he's willing why was it mercy it won't
[1:12:46] be you see before he ever got blessed
[1:12:48] mercy had ministered an opening status
[1:12:51] to Jacob sighs and Jacob was able to see
[1:12:54] this being is more than a man what was
[1:12:57] that mercy walked in
[1:13:00] he said I will not let thee go except
[1:13:02] thou bless me verse 29 and Jacob asked
[1:13:05] him and said tell me I pray thee thy
[1:13:07] name and he said wherefore is if thou
[1:13:10] asked after my name and he blessed him
[1:13:12] there and Jacob called the name of the
[1:13:14] place Peniel for I have seen
[1:13:34] Jacob barely walked out
[1:13:41] you know what if you're stubborn and
[1:13:43] hard-headed and God has a hard time
[1:13:45] dating with you he may have to nearly
[1:13:46] break your leg break your neck break
[1:13:48] everything about your body you may have
[1:13:49] to climb out of here one of these day
[1:13:51] near broke to pieces but you can look at
[1:13:53] it with a ride to understanding mercy
[1:13:55] walked in mercy walked in I'm calling
[1:13:58] out but I'm a better man I'm a better
[1:14:00] man I'd rather crawl out by the mercy of
[1:14:02] God that walk out a proud man wind up
[1:14:04] going to hell come on Saint sometime God
[1:14:07] has to break our pride look at Paul what
[1:14:10] a man he was and he said you know all
[1:14:12] the things that he went through what was
[1:14:13] it because Paul's humanity still dealt
[1:14:16] without the Lord even allowing a thorn
[1:14:17] in the flesh to buffeting unless he
[1:14:19] should be exalted above measure if the
[1:14:21] tendency for arrogance is not there
[1:14:23] there's no need for God to ever let that
[1:14:25] be there what was it Paul began to
[1:14:27] recognize this thorn it's a mercy that
[1:14:30] walked into me if it had not been for
[1:14:32] that my flesh that have been exalted I
[1:14:35] would have got lifted up in the message
[1:14:36] can't you see sometimes God will let us
[1:14:39] be run down hated ridicule mercy walked
[1:14:42] into your life mercy walked into your
[1:14:44] life
[1:14:49] can I have a few moments
[1:14:54] that's good because today when the Lord
[1:14:56] started putting all this stuff together
[1:14:58] for me it was coming from every
[1:15:00] direction I was going back into eternity
[1:15:02] coming down through time wind up over in
[1:15:04] Revelation going back to Revelation
[1:15:06] chapter five going on back with Daniel I
[1:15:08] never had a message to come together in
[1:15:09] such explosive down on that value in my
[1:15:11] life I said Lord this is gonna be good
[1:15:16] not because I'm preaching because it's
[1:15:18] his word
[1:15:19] when Israel was down in the land of
[1:15:22] Egypt that's it is chapter 3 verse 1
[1:15:24] Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[1:15:27] father how the priests submitting and he
[1:15:29] led the flock to the backside of the
[1:15:31] desert and came to the mountain of God
[1:15:33] even to Horeb and
[1:15:36] the angel of the Lord
[1:15:39] appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out
[1:15:42] of the midst of a bush
[1:15:44] mercy walked in
[1:15:51] mercy walked in he had been silent for
[1:15:54] hundreds of years this gentleman is I
[1:15:57] thought Judy Garland 4 sacred hymn but
[1:16:00] mercy and what did he do mercy walked in
[1:16:03] a bush
[1:16:06] but when mercy walks out he'll not walk
[1:16:09] out by himself
[1:16:11] Lords of God a man may be looked and
[1:16:15] behold the bus farmer found the bush was
[1:16:17] not consumed the Moses said I will now
[1:16:19] turn aside and see this great shot
[1:16:21] what's mercy doing no Mercy's called it
[1:16:24] come and see come and see I don't now
[1:16:26] turn and see this great sight while the
[1:16:29] bush is not burned verse 8 now here the
[1:16:32] voice begins to talk to him out of the
[1:16:33] bush I
[1:16:35] am calm down
[1:16:39] mercy
[1:16:41] here is Mercy himself I am come down to
[1:16:45] deliver them out of the hand of the
[1:16:46] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[1:16:48] the land into a good land and large unto
[1:16:51] a land flowing with milk and honey unto
[1:16:54] the place of the Canaan action they had
[1:16:55] touched in the Emirates and the
[1:16:56] parasites and the highlights and the
[1:16:58] jebusites now therefore behold a crowd

[1:18:16] mercy of God let me bring it on down and
[1:18:19] you're going to see where I'm going
[1:18:20] anyhow in the day that we're living in
[1:18:22] William Branham is not our mercy William
[1:18:25] Branham did not have mercy see but his
[1:18:27] coming to the earth was an advancement
[1:18:30] of God's mercy oh
[1:18:32] he was not mercy but he was a display of
[1:18:37] the mercy of God let me bring it on down
[1:18:39] a step further thirty years ago when the
[1:18:41] Lord sent a little video hillbilly from
[1:18:44] down in Kentucky Amen what was that
[1:18:47] mercy mercy when God laid somebody all
[1:18:52] on their heart to speak to you about the
[1:18:54] grace of God what was that mercy walked

[1:20:07] Moses walked in mercy walk
[1:20:10] why God City he was a gift of God's
[1:20:15] mercy people laugh at this message I
[1:20:17] laugh at Malachi for let him do whatever
[1:20:19] they want say whatever they want to us
[1:20:21] as believers we look at this prophet and
[1:20:25] his message as an outlet of God's mercy
[1:20:28] if not we could be a Pentecostal church
[1:20:31] tonight or a church across or a badness
[1:20:33] or whatever more while aren't with our

[1:20:43] God to get rid of all these evil things
[1:20:45] I don't want these around me and while I
[1:20:47] was down there praying a line appeared
[1:20:49] on the floor and a man stepped into the
[1:20:51] light about two hundred pearl olive
[1:20:53] colored skin is hair dark hanging down
[1:20:55] and said I've come to tell you a batch
[1:20:58] of could procure your birth I said so

[1:21:03] given three signs what was it mercy
[1:21:06] walked in brother Branham walked out
[1:21:09] Lord God
[1:21:13] Massey Walton and a young prophet of God
[1:21:16] walked out with a flame of fire in his
[1:21:19] heart
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:31] what was eight years ago when brother
[1:21:33] Calvin Ward sitting back I was in the
[1:21:35] hospital the doctor heard of giving him
[1:21:37] any hope of living at all and a heart
[1:21:38] attack
[1:21:40] but the Spirit of God
[1:21:43] anointed me
[1:21:45] now I walked in packing mercy
[1:21:49] in the few days Calvin
[1:21:55] what was it they got ahold to you when
[1:21:58] you was that I lost without God or what
[1:22:00] was it when you come up here with a
[1:22:02] sickness or disease and brother tale a
[1:22:04] hands on you or brother Daryl laid hands
[1:22:06] on you and you won't upset but mercy
[1:22:08] walked in and you walked out well ah
[1:22:12] God you may be in your tonight bound
[1:22:15] with oppression or whatever more but if
[1:22:17] mercy can walk in this place you can
[1:22:19] walk out them doors from the coal
[1:22:21] totally delivered by the power of God
[1:22:23] because mercy walked in and you can walk
[1:22:27] out help
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:42] the children of is have complained and
[1:22:44] griped
[1:22:45] numbers 21 five the people speak against
[1:22:49] God and against Moses
[1:22:51] wherefore if you brought us up out of
[1:22:53] Egypt to down the wilderness
[1:22:56] there's no bread neither is there any
[1:22:59] water our souls loveth this message this
[1:23:04] is my bread
[1:23:10] and the Lord sent fiery serpents among
[1:23:12] the people and they bit the people and
[1:23:15] much people of Israel died
[1:23:18] therefore the people came to Moses and
[1:23:21] said we've sinned we've spoken against
[1:23:23] the Lord and against thee pray until the
[1:23:26] Lord that he'll take away the Serpent's
[1:23:27] from us and Moses prayed for the people
[1:23:31] but sometimes prayer isn't enough
[1:23:36] mercy has to be revealed in a symbol
[1:23:41] and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:23:46] make thee a type of Christ
[1:23:54] you imagine what the devil must have
[1:23:57] thought when he was standing there that
[1:23:58] day and heard this mercy divine
[1:24:01] dispensation of Mercy given to the
[1:24:03] people of Israel and Satan thinking his
[1:24:05] man God what are you doing I am the type
[1:24:08] of the serpent I'm of always from the
[1:24:11] Garden of Eden on I'm always been
[1:24:13] identified as the serpent what are you
[1:24:15] doing God
[1:24:18] make the affari Serpent and settle upon
[1:24:21] a pole and it shall come to pass that
[1:24:23] every one that is bitten when he looketh
[1:24:26] upon it mercy will walk
[1:24:29] and he shall live oh
[1:24:33] how in the world can it be so you're out
[1:24:36] 500 yards or a quarter of a mile away
[1:24:38] from the camp and the serpent you final
[1:24:40] upon the fiery serpent poison venom then
[1:24:43] I'm never comin when you invite you to
[1:24:44] fill out firing up into your body and
[1:24:46] you've got to make a way you've got to
[1:24:48] get back to the camp the faster you run
[1:24:50] the faster your hearts pumping its
[1:24:51] pumping faster and faster and faster
[1:24:53] it's pumping more venom it's gonna make
[1:24:55] a circulations or your body but you're
[1:24:57] looking beyond that to the pulsation of
[1:24:59] faith my God is made away if I can get
[1:25:02] there and I can look on that pole I will
[1:25:04] be here why mercy walked in oh
[1:25:08] my lord but it wasn't just mercy that
[1:25:11] walked in that God wanted God wanted
[1:25:13] them to walk out God didn't just want me
[1:25:16] to preach this to you tonight so you can
[1:25:18] say boy that's a good sign God wanted
[1:25:20] mercy to walk in here and he wanted you
[1:25:22] to walk out heal he wanted you to walk
[1:25:25] out delivered
[1:25:27] [Applause]
[1:25:35] Moses made a serpent of brass and put it
[1:25:37] upon a pole and it came to pass that if
[1:25:40] a serpent had been any man when he
[1:25:41] beheld the serpent of brass he is
[1:25:51] well
[1:25:53] so you're bitten on your hand your leg
[1:25:56] your foot whatever it was you're all
[1:25:57] swollen up the blood is running to the
[1:26:00] pain is so fierce it's just fury ating
[1:26:02] your body you can't stand it your mouth
[1:26:04] is so dry we'll just probably aspects of
[1:26:06] being bitten and you say your god I'm
[1:26:08] not gonna make of a son say yes I'm
[1:26:09] gonna make it why cause mercy walked in
[1:26:11] mercy walked in I don't understand what
[1:26:14] that symbol means I don't understand
[1:26:15] what I don't mean all I know is all I've
[1:26:17] got to do is look and belief
[1:26:21] what did they believe mercy walked in
[1:26:23] their camp and gave them a dispensation
[1:26:25] of mercy and a symbol if they could get
[1:26:27] there and believe they'd walk out heals
[1:26:31] let me have a few more minutes
[1:26:35] Moses is gone
[1:26:38] Joshua now is the leader
[1:26:41] yes a lot to contend with a lot to deal
[1:26:44] with how do you follow a man like Moses
[1:26:47] his tactics are going to be different as
[1:26:50] mannerisms are different way God's going
[1:26:51] to use him is different came to pass
[1:26:54] when Johnson was by Jericho he lifted up
[1:26:56] his eyes and looked and behold
[1:26:58] there stood a man
[1:27:01] over against him with his sword drawn on
[1:27:03] his hand
[1:27:06] he didn't realize it yet but mercy
[1:27:09] walked him
[1:27:12] Just Cause mercy has a sword drone don't
[1:27:15] mean he's going to use it on you
[1:27:19] it may be going to night you with the
[1:27:22] sword
[1:27:24] his sword can be your courage and
[1:27:26] strength if you look at it in the right
[1:27:28] way but now you have to say this would
[1:27:30] be quite alarming so you're looking over
[1:27:33] against and you see this individual
[1:27:34] saying there looks like a man again no
[1:27:36] wings on his back so he doesn't look
[1:27:38] like an angel no feathers and none of
[1:27:39] that sort of thing but he looks over and
[1:27:41] this guy's got his sword drawn now
[1:27:43] listen what he said and he said he's so
[1:27:45] naughty Santa just shall win unto him
[1:27:47] and said unto Him or thou for us
[1:27:50] or for our adversaries and
[1:27:54] he said nay but
[1:27:57] as a captain of the host of the capital
[1:28:01] L capital o capital R capital D a mine L
[1:28:05] calm guess what Mercy
[1:28:09] [Laughter]
[1:28:16] Mercy now walked in the camp oh brother
[1:28:21] dong did look like mercy ho yes it did
[1:28:23] this is the captain the Lord's host and
[1:28:26] he's not against you he's on your side
[1:28:28] Oh
[1:28:30] glory and Joshua fell on his face to the
[1:28:34] earth and did worship and said unto Him
[1:28:37] what saith my lord
[1:28:40] unto his
[1:28:42] servant
[1:28:44] mercy walked in and Joshua's fixing to
[1:28:48] walk out and the captain the Lord's host
[1:28:51] senator Joshua loosed a shoe from off
[1:28:54] that foot ah walking huh
[1:28:58] mercy walked in now he's gonna change
[1:29:01] his walk but it's gonna be a walk in
[1:29:03] humility you know yourself removing of
[1:29:06] the shoe in the Old Testament a sign of
[1:29:08] humility so now he's walked into the
[1:29:10] presence of Mercy in order to receive
[1:29:13] the full benefits of Mercy he's got to
[1:29:15] walk out in humility not in arrogance
[1:29:18] not in pride I've done this I've done
[1:29:19] that I'm angel of God I'm this and that
[1:29:21] on the other walk out of here Joshua in
[1:29:24] humility mercy walked in but you're
[1:29:27] gonna walk out changed Oh
[1:29:30] God can I go one more please
[1:29:39] and there happened to be
[1:29:42] predestinated seed
[1:29:45] in Jericho
[1:29:50] but she was a Gentile the dog
[1:29:55] there was no scriptures written about as
[1:29:57] far as what she knew because her
[1:29:59] identity was hidden the mystery of
[1:30:01] Christ which was hid in the heart of God
[1:30:03] but there was something pulling her even
[1:30:05] though there wasn't a written word I
[1:30:07] hope they don't stab me if Rahab could
[1:30:10] be pulled without a written promise Lord
[1:30:12] of Mercy these written promises ought to
[1:30:14] pull us over the top of ourselves these
[1:30:16] written promises are linear they pull us
[1:30:18] inside out this woman didn't even have a
[1:30:21] promise she didn't have a quote she
[1:30:23] didn't have a scripture she didn't have

[1:30:31] didn't have Psalm 69 12 she didn't have
[1:30:33] all these things that she could fall
[1:30:34] back hard all she had was a pulsation of
[1:30:37] something down inside of her that said

[1:34:38] you're living in this Laodicean city of
[1:34:40] darkness
[1:34:41] something is struck or soul

[1:34:48] pointed that'll be plenty she got such a
[1:34:49] baptism of the mercy of God

[1:36:13] wall
[1:36:14] hers was the only one was special
[1:36:17] built-in message elevators
[1:36:20] now even though she might have been up
[1:36:22] on top and yet the scripture said the
[1:36:24] walls fell down flat hers in this case
[1:36:29] everybody else is cracking and reeling
[1:36:32] and calmer hers is going
[1:36:37] Wow mercy walked in she walked out
[1:36:43] don't you understand children
[1:36:46] tribulation is coming upon the heirs

[1:36:50] look at the finest who came them how
[1:36:52] they're looking at don't you understand
[1:36:53] what that is it's a false hope because
[1:36:55] they're all my Trump stone this Trump's
[1:36:57] turn that is a false hope we know the
[1:37:00] money mark is going to follow that a
[1:37:01] stone but what's it going to do it's
[1:37:03] going to get a more drunk why are you
[1:37:05] are a part of it because mercy walked in

[1:37:23] you pull you out of that system and
[1:37:25] you're waiting now
[1:37:45] sometimes mercy walks in for salvation
[1:37:48] of the soul
[1:37:51] sometimes it walks in for a refreshing
[1:37:54] for healing for spiritual deliverance
[1:37:59] but don't never walk in without a divine
[1:38:03] purpose and call
[1:38:07] the Spirit of God from inside the ark

[1:38:47] who was it that came out was Noah out of
[1:38:49] the ark
[1:38:50] those who win and they are quiz him oh
[1:38:54] you said brother don't you make it sound
[1:38:56] like you have to have this message to go
[1:38:58] on the rapture oh I'm sorry I'm just
[1:39:00] making it sound that way well let me
[1:39:01] make it more sure you ain't going in the
[1:39:03] rapture if you're alive in this day
[1:39:05] without this message oh I belong to a
[1:39:08] Baptist Church the Methodist Pentecostal
[1:39:09] Church they don't teach the message
[1:39:11] you've got to have a rapture message in
[1:39:12] order to be in a rapture and with no
[1:39:15] woman called except for the woman that
[1:39:16] Ellie's or was sent to and that was it
[1:39:18] you got to have this message to make a
[1:39:21] rapture France or you send the Baptist
[1:39:24] don't have mercy no no I'm not saying
[1:39:25] that at all but the allotment of mercy
[1:39:27] they got will let them say right here in
[1:39:29] tribulation and be judged the
[1:39:31] denominations the same way but you
[1:39:34] receive such a portion of mercy that the
[1:39:37] Lord God will not allow you to be here
[1:39:39] during the time of tribulation he loves
[1:39:42] you too much
[1:39:43] so one day when he leaves the mercy seat
[1:39:46] in heaven the corresponding part on the
[1:39:49] earth
[1:39:50] will begin to reflect the same thing he
[1:39:53] leaves the mercy seat it's time for you
[1:39:55] to leave here and whenever you leave
[1:39:58] mercy goes with you and the Gentile
[1:40:01] dispensation will be finished that's how
[1:40:05] much you are tied to the mercy seat of
[1:40:08] God
[1:40:09] so when you leave no more Gentiles will
[1:40:13] be saved then God will be dealing with
[1:40:16] Jews don't give up on your family now
[1:40:19] your prayers may be don't lonely ones
[1:40:21] that God hears
[1:40:23] that's right pray for him but mother
[1:40:26] don't know whether or not Brad hey
[1:40:27] friend you Mouse accept the fact all of
[1:40:29] our family ain't gonna be bribed no we
[1:40:32] can't make him bride only God does that
[1:40:34] that's not our choice that's his choice
[1:40:37] Abraham never did pray that lot would be
[1:40:39] a silver dollar like him but he just
[1:40:42] prayed that God would save him or have
[1:40:43] mercy on him and he was a saved penny
[1:40:46] but at least he was saved how was he
[1:40:49] saved through the intercession of
[1:40:52] Abraham
[1:40:54] praise God
[1:40:56] so if mercy has walked into you
[1:40:58] why don't you and mercy walk out and try
[1:41:02] to reach out an extending hand
[1:41:04] always marveled whenever I go out and
[1:41:07] preach in funerals and you have
[1:41:09] believers and unbelievers and make
[1:41:10] believers and all kinds of folks sitting
[1:41:12] there and I marvel I've preached
[1:41:15] funerals where there was hundreds and
[1:41:17] hundreds there police officers state
[1:41:18] troopers all kinds of people that was
[1:41:20] our celebrities and important people
[1:41:22] around the tri-cities area here and I
[1:41:25] marvel how the Spirit of God will lead
[1:41:28] you even in a direction to touch maybe a
[1:41:30] foolish virgins heart
[1:41:32] but you understand you have to be a
[1:41:34] surrendered vessel if you send up during
[1:41:35] your pride and arrogance bless God I'm
[1:41:37] only here to preach to the bride you're
[1:41:39] gonna miss many an opportunity maybe you
[1:41:40] could be a blessing to somebody as some
[1:41:42] came up to me life's not they sure
[1:41:44] didn't look like you all they sure what
[1:41:46] and Holderness looking but they come up
[1:41:48] and told me how blessed they were but
[1:41:50] what they heard I thought I sure would
[1:41:52] like to tell you some more of what I
[1:41:54] know
[1:41:54] but what was it mercy mercy extended to
[1:41:59] them and the way that they could receive
[1:42:01] it Oh
[1:42:02] Abraham seed let mercy be extended to
[1:42:06] you tonight what do you need healing oh
[1:42:09] I'm not sick No maybe you don't need it
[1:42:12] in your body maybe it's in your spirit
[1:42:15] can grudges own abilities and abilities
[1:42:18] rather to forgive can't put things
[1:42:21] behind you jealous or whatever more but
[1:42:25] mercy walk in and you and mercy walk out
[1:42:28] and you'll be healed touched
[1:42:31] delivered
[1:42:34] and we'd like to be remembered time
[1:42:36] before the Lord
[1:42:38] how many of you thank God - not for his
[1:42:40] word oh I they praise be to God
[1:42:44] let's just pray together
[1:42:48] Heavenly Father I know this has been
[1:42:50] very simple and I'm sure they are
[1:42:54] surprised the way I was surprised as you
[1:42:56] started
[1:42:57] overwhelming me with these things and
[1:42:59] just putting them together so fast that
[1:43:01] I could hardly keep up for support
[1:43:04] as I tried to lay down a little bit
[1:43:07] today and rest and I laid down on the
[1:43:10] couch downstairs and I couldn't even lay
[1:43:11] there I got up and put a fault down and
[1:43:14] then lay down again and got up and put
[1:43:17] another and down I'm so afraid I'd miss
[1:43:19] so I so afraid I'd miss a scripture
[1:43:22] quote that might be the very one that
[1:43:24] help wanted children tonight
[1:43:27] Lord God
[1:43:29] made me helpless
[1:43:31] you see each of our needs
[1:43:34] maybe there's some like Jacob
[1:43:36] they've not been so good
[1:43:39] maybe there's others Lord like Rahab
[1:43:43] maybe there's others Lord like David
[1:43:46] that got out of fellowship
[1:43:48] but let mercy walk after that
[1:43:52] prophet said whenever he prayed that
[1:43:54] prayer restore unto me the joy of our
[1:43:56] salvation he said David had lost his
[1:43:59] salvation but it lost his joy
[1:44:03] me mercy walk in if things have creeped
[1:44:06] in their lives lord help us out pray my
[1:44:11] mercy walk in Lord so we can walk out

[1:48:56] some of the aisles of many no doubt they

[1:49:07] disease and your liver is this and that
[1:49:08] in the other and we're just not sure
[1:49:11] what could happen it sounded like a
[1:49:14] terrible message and it was humanly
