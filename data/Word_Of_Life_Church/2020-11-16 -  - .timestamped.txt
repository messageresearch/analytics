[31:40] before that ever happens earthquakes
[31:45] that will be beyond anything our nation
[31:47] has ever known
[31:49] millions will die at one time

[32:21] because it is a gathering of the eagles
[32:25] i used to fly around with the crows i
[32:28] used to sit with the chickens
[32:30] come on you did too but i'm so glad i
[32:33] finally one day realized
[32:35] who i was by the grace of god amen
[32:39] gracious today in the name of the lord
[32:41] jesus so happy for the opportunity to be
[32:44] gathered together again today
[32:45] and in the house of god we know we're
[32:48] living in strenuous times difficult
[32:50] times but
[32:51] there are also great things that are
[32:53] happening as we just heard the testimony
[32:54] there a while ago and
[32:56] the lord is doing doing wonderful things
[32:58] we had a
[32:59] waiting here on friday so right in the
[33:02] middle of difficulty
[33:04] middle of hardships good things are
[33:06] happening
[33:07] brother aaron and sister melissa vaughn
[33:09] had a new baby
[33:11] boy that was born so here's marriages
[33:14] and
[33:15] babies being born and the time that
[33:17] people are dying
[33:18] distress and trouble and heartache while
[33:21] people don't know what to do
[33:22] it really just depends on the way you're
[33:24] going to look at it trouble going to
[33:26] come
[33:26] certainly it's going to come but we have
[33:28] a way to be able to deal with it by the
[33:30] grace of god
[33:31] we have a promise that the world does
[33:33] not have and that is that all
[33:35] things will work for the good to go to
[33:38] them that love the lord
[33:40] who are the called according to his
[33:43] purpose
[33:44] how many can witness that today that
[33:46] it's happened in your life
[33:48] things that it looked like there's no
[33:49] way that it would work out
[33:52] and out of some hardships that seemed so
[33:54] unbearable
[33:56] and yet god turned something into it and
[33:58] just make it such a tremendous blessing
[34:01] amen let's turn again today if you would
[34:04] to the book of romans
[34:06] chapter 8 chapter 8 and verse 8. we'll
[34:11] read a few verses here
[34:20] i want to speak to you animals today
[34:27] on the way you got back
[34:31] now i'm not sure if you all understand
[34:33] or not but
[34:34] everybody that i'm looking at is an
[34:36] animal
[34:38] this man you're looking at here on the
[34:40] pulpit is an animal
[34:44] paul was an animal i'm gonna make some
[34:46] of you mad but
[34:47] william branham was an animal all the
[34:50] branham family are animals
[34:52] all the reagan family are animals you
[34:55] might as well say it just go ahead
[34:58] but god wanted to make a way
[35:02] to be able to get us out of that animal
[35:05] dominance
[35:06] that controlled our lives
[35:09] so then they that are in the flesh
[35:12] cannot please god that is living by the
[35:15] nature of the animal
[35:17] life living in the flesh and after the
[35:20] flesh
[35:22] but ye are not in the animal life
[35:26] but in the spirit if so be
[35:29] the spirit of god dwelling you
[35:33] now if any man have not the spirit of
[35:35] christ
[35:37] he is none of his and if christ
[35:41] being you the body is dead because
[35:45] of sin but the spirit is
[35:48] life now you notice this is capital s
[35:50] which is not
[35:51] human spirit but holy spirit god's
[35:54] presence
[35:55] but the spirit is life because
[35:58] of righteousness but if the spirit of
[36:02] him that raised up jesus from the dead
[36:05] dwelling you he that raised up christ
[36:09] from the dead shall also quicken
[36:12] your mortal bodies because you learn to
[36:16] memorize the quotes
[36:18] and because you learn to memorize the
[36:20] word no
[36:21] that's not the way you overcome right
[36:24] you could be
[36:24] a marvelous theologian you could know
[36:28] the message and know the bible
[36:30] know the greek and the aramaic and the
[36:33] diphthongs and all the rest them
[36:34] thongs and in and out and all that stuff
[36:36] that goes with it
[36:38] and be as lost as loss could be
[36:41] because it's not the knowing of the word
[36:43] that quickens your
[36:44] life into obedience but it's the spirit
[36:48] he that raised up christ from the dead
[36:50] shall also
[36:51] quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[36:55] that dwelleth in you
[36:58] how many like to be remembered today as
[37:00] we go to the lord in prayer
[37:02] let's just pray god will open our hearts
[37:04] shall we to his word
[37:06] lord jesus we love you so much today
[37:10] thank you father for redeeming us
[37:13] lord from ourselves god i pray
[37:17] that you would open our understanding
[37:20] today
[37:23] may the marvel and the mystery of what
[37:26] you've done
[37:28] make it simple for us today would you
[37:30] lord
[37:31] i pray god that your great presence
[37:36] would take the word i've read it and i
[37:39] will read more here shortly and
[37:42] try my best to help them to see it but
[37:45] really i can only go so far
[37:48] it takes you to help us lord god may
[37:52] your
[37:52] presence come today you saw that there
[37:54] were hundreds of hands that were
[37:56] uplifted here today
[37:59] signifying a need some might have been
[38:02] small some might have been so urgent
[38:06] that they don't know what to do
[38:08] but you're a god the only god that there
[38:11] really is
[38:12] that can give life and answer prayer
[38:16] lord as i've stood in the hindu worship
[38:19] festivals and
[38:21] see them lord god take long pens about
[38:25] six inches long and
[38:27] run them through the tongues of those
[38:29] worshipers
[38:31] seen them take gigantic grab hooks and
[38:35] put in the backs of those people and
[38:37] watch them as they would pull
[38:39] those carts with these idle images on
[38:43] them
[38:44] they would be so far out under demonic
[38:47] anointing
[38:48] they didn't even know where they were
[38:51] but lord god
[38:54] there was not a god of life there
[38:56] anywhere
[38:58] it was just heathen idol worship
[39:01] lord jesus we don't approach an idol
[39:04] today
[39:05] we do not want to even make your cross
[39:08] an idol or we don't want to make you
[39:11] an idol we want you to be a living god
[39:15] for an idol god we can pick it up in our
[39:18] pocket
[39:19] polish it we can change its looks and
[39:22] that's what many people have done to you
[39:25] they have this idol called jesus christ
[39:30] they have an idol that they call jesus
[39:32] christ
[39:34] but they have changed your character
[39:36] they've made you
[39:37] fit their modern ideology of this day
[39:41] but we don't want no idol called jesus
[39:44] christ
[39:45] we want a living god called jesus christ
[39:49] that we cannot shape we cannot change
[39:53] we cannot alter but instead of us
[39:56] wanting to alter you
[39:58] we want you to alter us
[40:02] granted i pray today father in the name
[40:05] of the lord jesus
[40:07] and the saints said amen god bless you
[40:10] may be seated
[40:15] paul says in galatians chapter 2 verse
[40:18] 20
[40:19] i am crucified with christ
[40:23] nevertheless i live
[40:26] yet not i
[40:29] but christ that liveth in me
[40:32] the life which i now live
[40:36] in the flesh or in the animal part
[40:41] i live by the face of the son of god
[40:46] who loved me and gave himself
[40:50] for me so in
[40:53] my animal life
[40:56] paul was saying in my flesh
[41:00] in my animal life is
[41:03] another person that my animal life
[41:07] is just a mask as most of you have one
[41:11] on here today
[41:13] except the mass that you are wearing
[41:16] is only partial covering your nose
[41:20] your face your mouth a big portion of
[41:23] your face
[41:24] but the real mask is not the blue
[41:27] the black the green whatever you have on
[41:29] today
[41:30] but the real mask is the animal
[41:34] body that contains the living god
[41:38] now whenever you all get done with
[41:40] service today i'm sure that most of you
[41:43] are so happy that you cannot
[41:46] wait to get outside that door
[41:49] and get in safe range and reach up there
[41:52] and
[41:52] pull that crazy thing off of your face
[41:57] is there anybody here that loves your
[41:58] mask is there anybody that wants to wear
[42:02] it even when it comes to a spot that
[42:04] they say we don't need to wear it
[42:06] anymore
[42:07] is there anybody here so in love with
[42:09] your mask that you
[42:11] simply want to wear it every day for the
[42:14] rest
[42:15] of your life really you know what
[42:18] puzzles me about that is that how come
[42:20] we don't feel that way
[42:22] about the bigger mask
[42:25] now the reason most of us do not like it
[42:28] is because it's inconvenient
[42:30] those of you that have the paper ones
[42:32] are the same way no doubt that i
[42:33] am the little threads and things start
[42:35] coming loose on the inside and the
[42:37] golden tickling your nose and you're
[42:39] sitting there rubbing your nose and
[42:41] you're breathing it in and out and
[42:42] some of you i've noticed on sunday
[42:44] morning that it's depriving your oxygen
[42:46] a little bit
[42:47] because some of you all are more sleepy
[42:49] than you've ever been in your life
[42:52] uh so that that's just part of it
[42:54] actually some of you look better with a
[42:55] mask on it hides that nose of yours
[42:59] but for the most part we just we just
[43:02] don't like them
[43:03] right because it's inconvenient but we
[43:06] become
[43:06] so accustomed to this mask
[43:10] here we simply love it
[43:14] we take up for it if anybody would hurt
[43:18] this mask's feelings now
[43:22] anybody could criticize our face mask
[43:25] and most of us would just
[43:26] laugh right with them if they would say
[43:30] boy that's a strange color or why you
[43:32] got that
[43:33] we just oh you know oh you know but boy
[43:36] if they say something to hurt this mass
[43:39] fields
[43:40] we won't speak to him for a week we'll
[43:43] get on facebook and we'll
[43:45] isn't it amazing how we treat this
[43:48] mask versus this one
[43:53] now why is it that we so
[43:56] dislike this face mask or whatever
[43:59] you've got up whether it's this deal up
[44:01] on your net and you pull it up
[44:02] whatever it is it's supposedly trying to
[44:06] help you stay healthy
[44:08] but this one here is actually
[44:12] an animal this one
[44:15] now at least the one you've got on your
[44:17] face i don't
[44:18] see anybody here this morning with a
[44:20] bobcat or a
[44:22] lynx or a tiger or a cat or a dog or
[44:26] anything like that on your face so
[44:29] it is either cotton or nylon
[44:32] polyester mix or a hundred percent
[44:35] cotton
[44:36] or a fabric that is supposed to be
[44:38] three-ply
[44:39] strong
[44:44] this one here has caused you more
[44:46] problems than that mask among your face
[44:49] has ever cast
[44:53] some people won't come to church because
[44:55] they got to wear this one
[44:57] but actually this one ain't the problem
[44:59] the other mask
[45:01] is the issue
[45:04] now paul had come to a great
[45:07] understanding that i hope god will help
[45:10] us to come to eventually we will
[45:12] to where that he realized that
[45:15] in his animal life
[45:19] there was no good thing that
[45:22] his animal life was a
[45:25] constant battle and he had to die to it
[45:30] every day it was the greatest
[45:34] pitfall of his christianity
[45:37] his animal life but he knew
[45:41] that he had received another person
[45:44] in his person another
[45:48] soul in his soul
[45:51] unlike the paschal lamb of the old
[45:54] testament or a
[45:55] dove or a pigeon or an ox
[45:59] or whatever it was that it was the
[46:01] atonement or the
[46:02] wave offering or the sheave offering
[46:05] none of them now they had
[46:06] animal life or botany life which was
[46:09] taken from them
[46:10] to be offered before the presence of god
[46:13] for the worshiper
[46:14] but yet none of those had a soul
[46:18] when god started with the lord forms of
[46:20] life and started with maybe the one cell
[46:23] amoeba
[46:24] and started creating the lower forms of
[46:26] life and kept coming
[46:28] higher and higher and higher
[46:31] and for many of them even in the oceans
[46:34] that he began
[46:35] with those in the lower form of life and
[46:38] had a very
[46:39] very small span of intelligence
[46:43] but god kept bringing it higher and
[46:45] higher
[46:46] up to the dolphins and to the whales and
[46:49] many of those
[46:50] that man is able to teach them various
[46:54] things to do
[46:55] but certain things of the animal life
[46:58] in the water world it's like they do not
[47:02] have the ability
[47:03] you could spend all of your life trying
[47:05] to teach some of them tricks
[47:08] and they'll never do it because they do
[47:10] not have
[47:11] the ability to learn same in the animal
[47:15] life
[47:16] some animals we can teach them you can
[47:18] take your dog or a cat
[47:19] or certain animals certain birds you can
[47:22] teach them to do certain tricks
[47:24] because the advancement of the
[47:26] intelligence
[47:27] in creation yet not one of them
[47:30] has a soul now what is this
[47:34] mysterious thing that human beings have
[47:38] which is called a soul
[47:41] poets wrote about it and have been
[47:43] writing thus
[47:44] for thousands of years people who
[47:48] have written songs have written songs
[47:52] about the soul even people that don't
[47:54] believe in god
[47:55] but what really is the soul now we talk
[47:59] about why my soul this
[48:00] and my so that and god bless your soul
[48:03] and
[48:04] your soul but actually what is
[48:07] the soul our problem is a
[48:11] soul problem when we're born into the
[48:13] world now we're born of course
[48:16] in animal life but actually the animal
[48:19] life
[48:20] in the beginning was not wrong
[48:23] and it was not bad actually when god
[48:26] created it and placed the soul man
[48:31] inside the animal life believe it or not
[48:34] for how many every years that it was
[48:36] it was in perfect harmony so the animal
[48:39] life
[48:40] itself was not sinful
[48:43] originally but it was the breaths of god
[48:47] that breathed into the body or the
[48:50] animal life now god
[48:52] of course made this man in his own image
[48:55] now listen to me carefully that god
[48:58] is a trinity just as you are
[49:01] so you are a soul a spirit
[49:05] and a body which is father
[49:10] son holy ghost and jesus
[49:15] now listen the trinity of god is not
[49:18] three beings
[49:19] it's not three gods but it is father
[49:23] soul or holy spirit which is
[49:27] baptism of the holy ghost son of god god
[49:30] is a spirit
[49:32] and then we have the body which is
[49:35] jesus so your soul
[49:38] is in a reflected image of father god
[49:42] your human spirit in a condescended form
[49:46] is in that mirror image of the holy
[49:49] spirit now what is the son of god i know
[49:51] it confuses people it shouldn't really
[49:52] but the son of god is not just the human
[49:55] body
[49:56] but this is why brother branham would
[49:58] say he was revealed
[50:00] in the church ages as son of god which
[50:03] was not
[50:03] flesh but spirit so what was
[50:07] son of god the condescension of the work
[50:10] of god the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:12] that was able to get into human hearts
[50:15] how many have the holy ghost today what
[50:18] is that
[50:18] son of god in spirit form now the lord
[50:22] jesus the body the human part
[50:25] does not live in our human part
[50:29] it is the son of god what was it
[50:33] son or numa spirit of
[50:36] the eternal condescended forms so the
[50:39] sonship
[50:40] was the way father broke down the
[50:43] ability
[50:44] for his children to have a portion of
[50:46] his own life
[50:47] this is the real son of god this is what
[50:50] people miss
[50:51] when they keep pointing to the man the
[50:53] body
[50:54] the sacrificial atonement hanging on the
[50:56] cross and that's all they
[50:58] identify as the son of god and they
[51:00] think all they need is the literal
[51:02] chemistry from the blood
[51:04] of what they're calling the son of god
[51:05] but the son of god is more than the
[51:07] human body
[51:08] the son of god is that portion of spirit
[51:12] that comes back to live inside of you
[51:15] now today i have in my body
[51:17] the embodiment of the son of god i don't
[51:20] have jesus eyes
[51:21] i don't have jesus nose i don't have
[51:23] jesus ears
[51:24] but that body is on the throne of god
[51:27] but i have today in my body
[51:30] and so do you that have the holy ghost
[51:32] you have what's in you
[51:34] the very life of the son of god
[51:37] himself so how is it the son of god
[51:40] it's that condescended form of god the
[51:44] eternal
[51:45] which could not live just in me or live
[51:48] just in you but in the form
[51:51] of sonship he was able to divide himself
[51:54] on the day of pentecost what's this
[51:58] i don't know if it's been a while since
[51:59] you've listened to this or not but
[52:01] it might be good to listen to it some
[52:03] folks are afraid to listen to it because
[52:04] it can be
[52:05] a little bit scary but it's a sermon
[52:07] entitled souls
[52:09] that are in prison now now we don't want
[52:11] to look so much at the
[52:12] prison part although that's certainly
[52:15] going on around us
[52:16] but to me brother branham and whenever
[52:19] he goes to dealing with the soul
[52:21] inside of this sermon that he god
[52:24] allows him to open up things about the
[52:27] soul and bring
[52:28] things together that he never quite said
[52:31] before
[52:32] quite like this listen to this in
[52:33] paragraph 36 now the soul of man
[52:36] is not the body of man it's the soul
[52:40] see the soul is something
[52:43] that's the nature of the spirit
[52:46] now remember we've been looking about
[52:48] the kenosis
[52:49] of the lamb of god so it was more than
[52:52] just him becoming
[52:53] a man it was more than him becoming a
[52:56] human being
[52:57] and it was not enough that he would
[52:59] become just a human being
[53:01] and give himself in a substitutionary
[53:04] work
[53:04] but he must give us something back that
[53:08] would
[53:08] eliminate our issue now if he came
[53:11] only as a substitution and died on the
[53:15] cross in my place and said well i
[53:17] i take donny's problems and truly i
[53:20] would be the epitome
[53:21] of the gospel of what people preach
[53:24] today is
[53:24] and that a person that is a person that
[53:27] believes
[53:28] on the work that the lord jesus did but
[53:30] he did not impart to me a life to
[53:32] overcome
[53:33] now this is the gospel that the majority
[53:36] of christians believe today
[53:38] that the lord jesus took their place the
[53:41] lord jesus died
[53:42] for them and he knows basically they're
[53:44] a hopeless cause still are
[53:46] and they'll never be able to live a
[53:47] godly life they'll never be able to live
[53:49] a life above sin
[53:51] so they go ahead and sin a little bit
[53:52] every day sometimes more on other days
[53:55] on the weekend you know
[53:56] you can send a little bit more and you
[53:57] can really majorly sin on vacation
[54:00] but then you've always got the blood the
[54:02] blood cleanses you and all that
[54:03] so that's the gospel the watered-down
[54:06] version of it
[54:07] that many people believe today that you
[54:09] cannot live a perfect life
[54:11] if you don't you're lost the bible tells
[54:15] us
[54:15] be therefore perfect even as your father
[54:18] in heaven is perfect look you are not
[54:20] going to heaven
[54:21] a flawed man or woman you will leave
[54:24] perfect
[54:25] or you don't leave and there's only way
[54:27] we can ever reach perfection and that is
[54:30] for the perfected one to come himself
[54:32] but
[54:33] not leave us a symbol or an idol as i
[54:36] said in my prayer
[54:37] that many have turned christianity into
[54:39] an idol
[54:40] so they made the lord jesus simply an
[54:43] idol the cross
[54:44] is an idol and a piece of idolatry
[54:48] that is used and worshipped to me the
[54:50] cross it's much
[54:51] more than that as a matter of fact when
[54:53] you go to reading the gospels if you
[54:55] haven't done it lately
[54:56] and you go to reading from romans and
[54:57] galatians and philippians and philemon
[54:59] and thessalonians and all of that down
[55:01] through there
[55:01] you will find that they refer to the
[55:04] cross
[55:05] but to them it was not just those two
[55:07] pieces of wood
[55:08] but it was the metaphoric symbol of what
[55:11] the cross stood for
[55:12] but today the substitute of that of
[55:15] course
[55:16] catholic church claimed they have one of
[55:18] it they've got 20 some different nails
[55:20] that they drove in his hands i'm not
[55:21] sure how that works since it was just
[55:22] three
[55:23] uh but yet you know what do they want
[55:25] they want a natural
[55:26] something to be able to say well saint
[55:28] so and so was here
[55:30] and saint so-and-so so you go into many
[55:32] of those places and i've been to
[55:33] different catholic places around the
[55:35] world
[55:35] and whenever you do every one of them
[55:37] have those icons
[55:39] well you know the word icon is a greek
[55:41] word it's a great word when you place it
[55:43] in its meaning of actually what it is
[55:45] paul used the greek word icon and he
[55:48] used this several times in his epistles
[55:50] but he used it in the way of revelation
[55:52] and that is
[55:53] an image so it was an image a
[55:56] supernatural image that god gave to me
[55:59] but man takes the word icon and man
[56:02] wants to make
[56:03] a symbol so he wants to set up something
[56:06] that people can come and look toward
[56:09] and they can touch it and they can rub
[56:11] it and they can look at it and somehow
[56:13] that
[56:14] that thing imparts to them some kind of
[56:16] power nonsense
[56:18] heathenism well praise the lord
[56:21] well brother donny don't you go to some
[56:23] of them places sure
[56:24] i've been in sabino canyon i've been
[56:27] wrong tired but brother stephen smith
[56:28] took me years ago
[56:30] whenever the angel the lord come down
[56:32] and cut down the tops of the trees
[56:34] i stood right there where it happened
[56:36] and you can stand there and still see
[56:37] them trees
[56:38] because they're cut off now you've got
[56:40] others that are grown up real tall
[56:42] and you can see where the presence of
[56:44] god come down and cut them i've been
[56:46] there i thank god for those places
[56:48] but i never worshiped the trees when i
[56:50] was there i never worshiped the ground
[56:52] when i was there
[56:53] praise the lord i worship the god who
[56:56] came there
[56:57] who is still alive praise the lord i've
[57:00] been to jeffersonville i've been to the
[57:02] tabernacle brother billy paul's took me
[57:04] through
[57:04] let me go right there to brother
[57:06] random's office go back there and set it
[57:08] to death
[57:08] i thank god for that sure it has
[57:10] something to love i don't worship the
[57:12] desk
[57:13] i don't worth to worship the chair that
[57:15] he set in praise the lord
[57:17] i don't worship any of those things i've
[57:19] been to jerusalem or jesus
[57:21] was or he walked down through there the
[57:23] via de la rosa all that
[57:25] i never worshiped the stones i never
[57:28] worshiped the place where they set his
[57:30] body laid
[57:31] i worshiped the god who brought him out
[57:33] of there
[57:35] right so to us then we do not want
[57:38] to become heathens and worship the wood
[57:41] of the cross or we don't want to worship
[57:44] the man who brought us
[57:45] the message of the hour we want to
[57:47] worship the god
[57:49] of the message of the hour now whenever
[57:52] we go to looking at what makes us
[57:54] different than a cow
[57:56] a horse a dog a pig wonder why you never
[58:00] see a bird
[58:01] bowed down before an idol now whether or
[58:03] not you know it
[58:04] birds do worship and cows worship
[58:08] and horses worship and whales
[58:11] worship and dolphins worship and
[58:14] leaves actually worship
[58:18] they must be really sad right now for a
[58:20] lot of them have already
[58:22] lost their leaves and they will rejoice
[58:25] in the spring
[58:26] because they get their leaves back and
[58:28] they clap their little hands
[58:32] right you see the stars of heaven they
[58:35] actually
[58:36] worship god animals worship god
[58:39] let every sing that hath breasts praise
[58:43] ye
[58:43] the lord but have you ever walked by and
[58:46] seen a dog
[58:47] bow down to a wooden idol have you ever
[58:50] bowed down and see a cow
[58:52] or a horse or a pig now we'd call a pig
[58:55] a dumb animal
[58:56] but have you ever seen a dumb animal
[58:58] like a pig making an idol out of their
[59:01] own body
[59:02] the way humans do you ever see a pig
[59:05] worship
[59:06] itself or a dog or a cat no all they
[59:08] know is survival
[59:10] and reproduce and eat and survive and
[59:12] reproduce and they live their life
[59:14] and they're done and you'll never see
[59:16] them on their own
[59:18] instinct bow down why because they do
[59:21] not have
[59:22] a soul now i know that maybe some of you
[59:24] will put
[59:25] a little outfit on your dog or a little
[59:27] outfit on your cat
[59:28] or this that other but you'll never see
[59:30] a dog do it on its own because a dog
[59:33] does not have a soul so a dog
[59:36] does not know uh about covering
[59:40] a cat does not know about covering but
[59:43] why is it
[59:44] that we human beings and our right mind
[59:46] that we put on clothes and we know of
[59:48] course in the beginning we did not need
[59:50] them
[59:50] but once we broke from the dispensation
[59:53] of innocence
[59:54] then we moved into the dispensation of
[59:56] conscience
[59:57] so then with that god made us so that we
[1:00:00] have
[1:00:01] a conscience which will begin to prick
[1:00:03] us when we're very young
[1:00:04] when we say things wrong do things wrong
[1:00:07] or you know just do something that we
[1:00:09] shouldn't do
[1:00:09] then that conscience not even being
[1:00:11] saved not even being born again
[1:00:14] every human being has it it's part of
[1:00:16] the affiliation
[1:00:17] of god giving us that soul so what
[1:00:20] is that soul well it starts out
[1:00:23] as the nature of the spirit the prophet
[1:00:26] said
[1:00:26] then when the nature of a man when he
[1:00:29] said
[1:00:30] we are dead the scripture plainly tells
[1:00:32] us that we are dead
[1:00:33] and our lives are hid in god through
[1:00:35] christ sealed there by the holy spirit
[1:00:37] now it wasn't your body that died
[1:00:41] it wasn't your spirit that died
[1:00:44] it was the nature of your spirit dyed
[1:00:48] sea
[1:00:49] the nature which is the soul
[1:00:53] the nature of your soul
[1:00:56] is god if
[1:01:00] you're born again now you see what god
[1:01:04] must must accomplish through the work
[1:01:07] of kenosis in order to bring us back
[1:01:11] that the nature of our spirit
[1:01:14] will die it cannot be our spirit because
[1:01:18] in our spirit
[1:01:19] is imagination conscience memory reason
[1:01:22] and affection it cannot be our body
[1:01:25] as as the great learned man
[1:01:29] and saint john 3 was told about being
[1:01:32] born again and he said how nicodemus
[1:01:35] trying to understand how can a man enter
[1:01:36] the second time into his mother's womb
[1:01:38] and be
[1:01:38] born again but jesus was relating to him
[1:01:43] how that the new birth was from the
[1:01:45] inside out
[1:01:46] so many of you here today that are born
[1:01:49] again this
[1:01:50] is actually what happened to you now
[1:01:52] listen the
[1:01:53] nature of your soul is god
[1:01:57] if you're born again watch him now he
[1:02:00] does not say the nature of your spirit
[1:02:02] but the nature of your soul so your soul
[1:02:06] initially was the nature of your spirit
[1:02:10] but when you become born again
[1:02:13] then your soul is the nature
[1:02:17] of god now none of us are born that way
[1:02:19] all of us
[1:02:20] are born lost right we are not born
[1:02:24] saved we are not born regenerate
[1:02:27] we are born lost in this lost status
[1:02:31] all we brought to the earth but then god
[1:02:33] wanted to bring us to this state to
[1:02:36] where we are
[1:02:37] saved or found notice it's not of the
[1:02:40] world
[1:02:41] anything that began has to end so
[1:02:44] therefore the only way you can have
[1:02:45] eternal life
[1:02:47] is to have a life that never did begin
[1:02:49] and then your life
[1:02:50] did begin when you were born when god
[1:02:54] brings the breath of life into your
[1:02:56] nostrils
[1:02:56] and you became a living soul then you
[1:02:59] begin
[1:03:00] then now this is the natural part this
[1:03:03] is
[1:03:04] the animal but how do we ever get
[1:03:07] born again and what part is it
[1:03:10] that actually gets born again now i hate
[1:03:13] to say it today but the truth of it is
[1:03:15] for many christians they're trying to
[1:03:17] save
[1:03:18] the old man it's sad really how many
[1:03:22] message people believe that
[1:03:24] how many message preachers believe him
[1:03:26] you'll never show me a one that don't
[1:03:28] understand predestination that's ever
[1:03:30] got the new birthright
[1:03:32] because what do you do every time he'll
[1:03:35] want to take that thing that you were
[1:03:37] born in
[1:03:39] and wants to save that wants to sanctify
[1:03:43] that
[1:03:44] and try to fill that with the holy ghost
[1:03:47] and there's only one hope for you to
[1:03:50] ever be born again
[1:03:51] and that is that part they're trying to
[1:03:53] save
[1:03:54] is killed and then
[1:03:58] something else is reborn in you
[1:04:02] which is what the deposit of the seed of
[1:04:05] god
[1:04:06] you can see why satan hates this
[1:04:08] teaching in the message
[1:04:09] but that's all right i'm going to teach
[1:04:11] it anyhow
[1:04:12] the more hell fights it the more i'm
[1:04:14] going to preach it
[1:04:17] now once he says the scripture plainly
[1:04:20] tells us that we are dead our lives are
[1:04:21] hidden in god
[1:04:22] through christ seal there by the holy
[1:04:24] spirit now it wasn't your
[1:04:26] body that died it wasn't your spirit
[1:04:29] that died
[1:04:30] it was the nature which is the soul now
[1:04:33] watch now
[1:04:34] remember the predestinated seed that god
[1:04:37] sowed in you
[1:04:38] when you come to the earth that
[1:04:40] predestinated seed
[1:04:42] was not the nature of your spirit
[1:04:45] that you were born in it's quite hard
[1:04:47] for you to be quiet today and listen
[1:04:48] don't bother me
[1:04:49] it is not the nature of your spirit
[1:04:53] that we're referring to that deposit
[1:04:56] that god breathed
[1:04:57] into you the breath of life was nothing
[1:05:00] to do with your father or your mother
[1:05:03] it was nothing to do with you it was the
[1:05:05] deposit of eternal life
[1:05:08] god himself but now you cannot have
[1:05:12] two natures two souls in you
[1:05:15] that are alive and dominating at the
[1:05:18] same time
[1:05:19] but you can have the nature of your
[1:05:22] spirit which you were born with
[1:05:24] and it will yield to your first husband
[1:05:28] and that first husband will rule over
[1:05:30] you
[1:05:31] and the other one the seed of god will
[1:05:33] lay in you
[1:05:34] in a state of dormant it'll be dormancy
[1:05:36] and it will never
[1:05:38] it'll never be quickened it'll never
[1:05:40] come alive it cannot be
[1:05:42] because you would be deformed to have
[1:05:44] two souls
[1:05:46] in you at the same time well praise the
[1:05:49] lord
[1:05:50] so it will lay there for years for
[1:05:53] decades however long
[1:05:55] until god can get the nature of your
[1:05:58] spirit
[1:05:59] to reason together with him
[1:06:04] the lord now once he said the nature of
[1:06:08] your soul
[1:06:09] is god if you're born again
[1:06:13] and if it's not it's all of the world
[1:06:15] anything that begin
[1:06:16] has to end so therefore the only way you
[1:06:18] can ever have eternal life is to have a
[1:06:20] light
[1:06:21] that never did begin now watch this in
[1:06:23] paragraph 37
[1:06:25] that nature that was in you
[1:06:28] that nature you was of the world
[1:06:32] alienated from god that's exactly right
[1:06:35] actually an animal
[1:06:39] ah actually
[1:06:43] an animal anyone knows that we
[1:06:47] are now not that we were oh yes i was an
[1:06:51] animal before i become born again you're
[1:06:53] still one after you're born again
[1:06:56] but you're not an animal in your soul
[1:07:00] any longer now can you imagine if we'd
[1:07:03] be able to go to africa
[1:07:04] and catch a big lion and somehow would
[1:07:07] be able to go inside of that lion
[1:07:10] and find his nature and we would be able
[1:07:13] to take the nature out of that lion
[1:07:16] and we would take a sami's cat or we'd
[1:07:19] take your favorite house cat
[1:07:21] that is nature so mild and so gentle if
[1:07:25] there is such a thing in the house cat
[1:07:26] anyway now if we could be able to find
[1:07:28] that in the cat
[1:07:29] and be able to take this nature
[1:07:32] out of the house cat and put it inside
[1:07:36] this
[1:07:36] this black main line from africa
[1:07:40] and whenever he wakes up now he comes to
[1:07:44] himself
[1:07:45] and he begins to yawn and he wakes up
[1:07:48] and he looks around and here's impala
[1:07:51] that are standing by him and over here
[1:07:54] are
[1:07:54] jim's buck and over here are zebra
[1:07:57] and all kinds of things that are all
[1:08:00] around him
[1:08:00] which would have been appetizer
[1:08:03] breakfast
[1:08:04] lunch
[1:08:07] but now he looks at him and he says meow
[1:08:15] and we would look at that line and say
[1:08:18] what in the world
[1:08:20] instead of him getting out to oh
[1:08:33] you know that thing they do they know i
[1:08:35] don't like them and every time i get in
[1:08:37] round one
[1:08:38] they go straight to my legs
[1:08:41] looking up at me
[1:08:48] i say i'm not the only one they did that
[1:08:50] to
[1:08:53] it would be a marvel of science
[1:08:57] now this same line might have been
[1:08:59] brought up and taught
[1:09:01] not to kill and not to do this and that
[1:09:04] but the primate nature
[1:09:06] inside of that lion will do it this is
[1:09:08] why that they will turn on people
[1:09:10] that's that's been my you know been
[1:09:13] trainers and guides and so on
[1:09:15] and we hear about it all the time and
[1:09:17] they mauled them and they've done this
[1:09:18] and that and the other why
[1:09:20] because that nature is still in them but
[1:09:22] yet somehow
[1:09:24] we were able to go inside of there and
[1:09:26] actually help that lion
[1:09:28] have a new birth
[1:09:35] so he gets up and he shakes that black
[1:09:38] mane
[1:09:39] and he walks around and them impala they
[1:09:42] take off 90 miles an hour
[1:09:45] everything around him runs off and he
[1:09:47] said what's the matter
[1:09:49] i'm changed
[1:09:52] i'm not who i used to be
[1:09:56] that second generation impala was
[1:09:58] thinking you ate my mama
[1:10:00] you expect me to believe that right you
[1:10:03] ain't my grandpa you ate my third cousin
[1:10:06] my
[1:10:06] uncle so and so and so do you think he's
[1:10:09] gonna trust him it's gonna take a long
[1:10:10] time
[1:10:11] some way when we really become born
[1:10:13] again why because we're still living in
[1:10:16] this outer shell
[1:10:17] but god hallelujah god took the animal
[1:10:21] nature out of the soul and put the
[1:10:25] nature
[1:10:26] of jesus christ inside of us
[1:10:31] but we're still dealing with the roaring
[1:10:33] part
[1:10:37] now you see those of you that have the
[1:10:39] holy ghost you've got that little lamb
[1:10:41] on the inside
[1:10:43] boy he don't never get mad he don't
[1:10:46] never get all
[1:10:47] upset and frustrated amen
[1:10:52] but you got that line on the outside
[1:10:55] and he loves to roar
[1:11:00] oh he loves to scare people and he loves
[1:11:03] to intimidate or whatever more well
[1:11:05] you all don't understand what i'm
[1:11:07] talking about this morning
[1:11:12] oh how wonderful it would have been that
[1:11:14] the lord jesus wanted in his purpose to
[1:11:16] be able to
[1:11:17] totally eradicate the lion that i live
[1:11:20] in
[1:11:21] and made me a complete lamb
[1:11:25] but that was not his plan
[1:11:29] notice this the prophet said you see
[1:11:31] what made us different from other
[1:11:33] mammals let me go back here at the top
[1:11:35] of this paragraph read it again anyone
[1:11:36] knows that we are mammal how many knows
[1:11:38] that we are mammal
[1:11:39] we are warm blooded animal
[1:11:43] now don't raise your hands but i wonder
[1:11:44] how many folks here today fight temper
[1:11:46] don't raise your hand those of you out
[1:11:48] on the internet you either
[1:11:52] wonder how many folks fight temper
[1:11:55] and you on the occasion lose that temper
[1:12:00] and you say things you wish you wouldn't
[1:12:02] have said
[1:12:04] and most of the time when we're upset
[1:12:05] and angry we pick the
[1:12:07] sharpest cutting words we can find
[1:12:10] because we intend to hurt with them
[1:12:13] we want to make our point boy ain't
[1:12:15] nobody pushing me around
[1:12:16] bless god sit down in line and shut up
[1:12:21] that line of yours is going to get you
[1:12:22] in a heap of trouble
[1:12:26] well praise the lord now god
[1:12:29] put a soul
[1:12:32] in this animal life but yet i'm still
[1:12:36] a mammal i'm still an animal
[1:12:39] on the outside watch the way he relates
[1:12:42] this he says
[1:12:43] that what see what made us different
[1:12:45] from other mammals that god
[1:12:46] put a soul upon us now other mammals
[1:12:49] don't have to wear
[1:12:50] clothes no other mammal has to wear
[1:12:52] clothes to hide his shame but
[1:12:53] us we're the only ones that does because
[1:12:57] we have a soul but see god
[1:13:00] in the beginning knew what man would be
[1:13:03] like he created the earth and brought up
[1:13:05] all kinds of animals from the very
[1:13:07] lowest
[1:13:08] to the highest and the highest animal
[1:13:10] come
[1:13:11] forth was man
[1:13:15] don't you see what your body change is
[1:13:18] going to be
[1:13:19] finally change your animal life
[1:13:23] now here is this dove of the holy ghost
[1:13:26] this lamb of the holy ghost
[1:13:28] living inside of a wolverine
[1:13:37] or a pit bull for some of you
[1:13:42] or a donkey for some of you
[1:13:53] just depending on how your nature now
[1:13:55] listen
[1:13:56] you know as well as i know there are dog
[1:14:00] raisers here in the building today and
[1:14:01] they raised them
[1:14:02] professionally or you think that
[1:14:05] an animal now a mammal you got the same
[1:14:08] mother and the same
[1:14:09] father then why would them dogs or cats
[1:14:13] or whatever more
[1:14:14] wind up with a different nature
[1:14:17] now i've had a lot of different horses
[1:14:18] in my life and you know the breed of the
[1:14:20] horse
[1:14:21] has a lot to do with the horse but the
[1:14:24] horse itself
[1:14:25] also has an individuality
[1:14:28] about it same with dogs cats anything
[1:14:30] else and you say
[1:14:32] how how does that all come about that
[1:14:34] every one of them from the gene pool
[1:14:37] are not exactly identical so here you've
[1:14:40] got two dogs and they're brothers
[1:14:42] and yet one of them will be you know one
[1:14:44] way and the other will be another way
[1:14:46] one almost the best dog ever was and one
[1:14:48] of them ain't worth a lollipop
[1:14:50] i ain't got enough sense to get in and
[1:14:52] out of the rain i mean he's got a
[1:14:54] pedigree that llama don't do no good he
[1:14:56] can't read it he don't know what it's
[1:14:57] even for
[1:14:58] but you say what in the world well it's
[1:15:00] the grab bag of the way the gna and the
[1:15:03] dna
[1:15:03] or the genes brother comes out through
[1:15:05] the dna
[1:15:06] and then what you say many of us want to
[1:15:09] attribute
[1:15:10] our animal nature and stuff about our
[1:15:13] human makeup
[1:15:14] as being god-given no
[1:15:19] much of our nature is a higher form
[1:15:22] of dog life
[1:15:27] that's why in the family look i'm the
[1:15:28] oldest of seven so i know a little bit
[1:15:30] about variety
[1:15:31] i know a little bit about how from the
[1:15:33] same mother and from the same father
[1:15:35] can come different brothers men harry
[1:15:37] well we see a lot of things a lot but
[1:15:39] there's different makeup still between
[1:15:41] us
[1:15:42] and our human part our brother brother
[1:15:44] jamie and our sisters that we have
[1:15:46] and yet every one of us i'm glad it's
[1:15:48] that way i wouldn't want everybody to be
[1:15:50] like me and then i'm scared to death i
[1:15:51] might wind up being like somebody else
[1:15:55] well praise god now think about it then
[1:15:58] look at
[1:15:59] us whenever we are mammal and the same
[1:16:01] mother the same father
[1:16:03] and yet every one of us the outcome of
[1:16:06] our dna
[1:16:06] our genes and so on and we'll be able to
[1:16:09] send it off to 23 and me
[1:16:11] and they could go back how many ever
[1:16:12] generations and say well your uncle was
[1:16:14] so and so
[1:16:15] way back down on the pioneer days and oh
[1:16:17] my they've done this and that and the
[1:16:19] other
[1:16:19] but yet you might become the nature of
[1:16:22] one way behind you back here
[1:16:24] the prophet said that a family will have
[1:16:26] a child and it'll be born red-headed
[1:16:28] nobody in the family they know of
[1:16:31] is red-headed but yet that seed keeps
[1:16:33] passing right on down
[1:16:35] maybe the third generation back fourth
[1:16:37] generation back
[1:16:38] and here that seed comes out in the
[1:16:40] natural park well friends one of the
[1:16:42] worst things
[1:16:43] we can allow satan to do to us is
[1:16:46] convince
[1:16:46] us that our mammal ishmael
[1:16:50] is isaac the promised son
[1:16:54] you see if he cannot keep you away from
[1:16:57] god then he will try to convince you
[1:16:59] that much of your natural makeup is
[1:17:03] god-given then why would god anoint
[1:17:05] preachers to preach against our natural
[1:17:07] makeup that's wrong
[1:17:08] if god made us to be this way and then
[1:17:10] send preachers to preach against us
[1:17:13] what kind of god are you serving what
[1:17:15] kind of god do we have
[1:17:17] if god is so pleased with every one of
[1:17:19] our humanity our temper
[1:17:21] our anger and whatever more that we have
[1:17:24] the greatest enemy that we have in our
[1:17:26] life as our mammal makeup
[1:17:28] and yet god is so pleased with her
[1:17:29] brother lester god said well i don't
[1:17:31] want you to change well why in the world
[1:17:32] do i need to preach that
[1:17:34] why in the world do we need a bible
[1:17:36] unless god is telling us
[1:17:38] look you got that out of the human grab
[1:17:40] bag that's what the prophet called it
[1:17:42] the human grab bag and god sends his
[1:17:45] word and god sends the ministry
[1:17:47] to preach to us that we from the soul
[1:17:50] of the lamb will bring the outside body
[1:17:54] of the lion the donkey the pig the hog
[1:17:56] the bird
[1:17:57] you know whatever you are well
[1:17:58] hallelujah some of y'all got a peacock
[1:18:01] nature because you're all the time
[1:18:02] standing around fluffing your favors and
[1:18:04] want everybody to see how beautiful you
[1:18:07] are
[1:18:07] and you're so purity and you're just
[1:18:09] god's gift to all the women of the world
[1:18:11] you serpent thing you well hallelujah
[1:18:16] there ain't no peacocks in the economy
[1:18:18] of god
[1:18:19] there ain't no hogs in the economy of
[1:18:21] god there are sons and daughters of god
[1:18:24] the hogs is the body we're packing
[1:18:26] around the dogs are the bodies that
[1:18:28] we're packing around
[1:18:33] oh jesus
[1:18:38] notice this he says then
[1:18:41] after he done made man in his own image
[1:18:45] he created the male and female there was
[1:18:48] no man
[1:18:49] to till the soil and he put him in the
[1:18:52] dust of the earth and therefore
[1:18:54] he was that man so the first man
[1:18:59] was a man of genesis 1.
[1:19:02] then there was the man of genesis 2.
[1:19:05] and then there was the promised man of
[1:19:07] genesis 3.
[1:19:10] so the man of genesis 1 26
[1:19:13] was the spirit man but he placed that
[1:19:17] spirit man into a body
[1:19:20] of mammal animal flesh
[1:19:24] and emerged him inside that body
[1:19:27] so here he is the highest form of animal
[1:19:30] life why
[1:19:31] god wanted the man which is going to
[1:19:34] lead the
[1:19:35] animals to bear the image of the animals
[1:19:39] he would lead so if a man dies a woman
[1:19:43] dies a baby dies the dog dies a lion
[1:19:45] dies an elephant dies
[1:19:46] all these things die they all lay out on
[1:19:48] the on the sand somewhere
[1:19:50] and they lay there and they rot and they
[1:19:52] go back to the dust of the earth
[1:19:56] does man's dust have gold in it
[1:20:00] is man's death so supernatural and so
[1:20:04] wonderful let it lay there long enough
[1:20:06] and you will not be able to
[1:20:08] differentiate between the two
[1:20:09] between a billionaire or a dog
[1:20:13] why because the body goes right back to
[1:20:16] the dust of the earth
[1:20:18] it will rot come on saints you might as
[1:20:20] well say amen
[1:20:21] it will rot and go right back to the
[1:20:23] dust of the earth
[1:20:24] oh but if you've got that soul in there
[1:20:27] come from god
[1:20:29] amen notice this this human
[1:20:33] was mammal see he was animal he put
[1:20:36] this spirit of god
[1:20:39] ah put the
[1:20:42] spirit of god alive into him
[1:20:46] so here the first son of god
[1:20:50] stepped into an animal
[1:20:53] body a son
[1:20:57] of god stepped into an
[1:21:00] animal body and the body is standing
[1:21:03] there with his toes down into the
[1:21:05] into the dirt and like the roots of a
[1:21:08] tree and he's standing now with no life
[1:21:10] yet he has the mechanics of sinews and
[1:21:12] bones and
[1:21:13] cells and tissues and eyes and muscles
[1:21:16] and all of that
[1:21:16] but nothing is moving nothing is a lie
[1:21:19] and what does god do
[1:21:20] god breathes into him a type of the holy
[1:21:23] ghost
[1:21:24] god breathed into him the first son of
[1:21:27] god
[1:21:28] amen and when he received that son of
[1:21:31] god inside of him
[1:21:33] his eyes began to bat his heart kicked
[1:21:35] in for the first time
[1:21:37] his blood pressure started going up all
[1:21:39] the mechanics of his body started moving
[1:21:42] now it was divine life merged into
[1:21:45] animal life can't you see why
[1:21:49] god is going to perform reconciliation
[1:21:51] and redemption
[1:21:52] god must come down and live in a body
[1:21:55] also like mammal
[1:21:58] he must live in a body that is like his
[1:22:00] wife
[1:22:01] he must live in a body that is like his
[1:22:04] creation
[1:22:07] oh my notice now how the prophet goes
[1:22:10] into this about
[1:22:11] god bringing us to a new birth but that
[1:22:13] soul
[1:22:14] that's in their sea that soul is what
[1:22:18] god is working on see if he can get that
[1:22:22] nature that spirit
[1:22:25] to agree with him then that nature dies
[1:22:28] now this is what happens
[1:22:30] when you started feeling something
[1:22:32] moving on you
[1:22:33] whether it was in a church in a barn in
[1:22:36] a bar stool
[1:22:37] wherever it was and the spirit of god
[1:22:40] started moving on your heart
[1:22:42] and you felt something pulling you this
[1:22:44] is what was going on
[1:22:46] god was moving on that nature of your
[1:22:50] spirit that you was born with
[1:22:52] this is why you might have got emotional
[1:22:54] you might have got scared
[1:22:55] you might have started crying you might
[1:22:57] have felt fear trauma what was it
[1:22:59] death was moving near your nature
[1:23:02] praise speak to god death was moving
[1:23:06] near your nature that you were born with
[1:23:10] and it frightens you it alarms you
[1:23:14] because you never felt anything like it
[1:23:16] before
[1:23:17] in your life and even though you were
[1:23:19] not exactly sure what was going on
[1:23:21] it was an alarm to you something began
[1:23:24] to move
[1:23:25] in you inside of you oh god oh god
[1:23:28] please forgive me lord
[1:23:30] i'm so wrong i'm so wrong god please
[1:23:32] have mercy god
[1:23:34] let me die right here lord
[1:23:38] well if you really meant that
[1:23:41] the spirit of god took the life
[1:23:46] of your old nature
[1:23:57] if he can only get that nature that
[1:24:00] spirit
[1:24:01] to agree with him
[1:24:04] then thy nature god friend you're
[1:24:07] talking about a miracle
[1:24:09] the new birth is one of the greatest
[1:24:12] miracles you'll ever experience
[1:24:16] that god could actually get your nature
[1:24:20] your sinful nature to agree agree to
[1:24:23] what
[1:24:25] to die
[1:24:29] then that nature dies the nature
[1:24:33] and the love of the world
[1:24:37] you see friends while folks are missing
[1:24:38] the new birth
[1:24:40] well i accept the lord jesus says my
[1:24:42] savior i'll quit drinking i'll quit
[1:24:43] smoking i'll quit running around i'll
[1:24:45] quit i'll quit i'll quit all quickly
[1:24:46] and many of them do but then they go to
[1:24:49] feeding the craving the desire the
[1:24:52] hunger
[1:24:52] and they go back to doing the same
[1:24:54] things they've done before and worse
[1:24:56] why they never let that nature come
[1:24:59] together with god
[1:25:00] and god killed that nature and that
[1:25:03] nature be annihilated forever
[1:25:05] if you're ever born again you will never
[1:25:08] ever ever have the nature of the world
[1:25:11] inside
[1:25:12] you again is totally impossible
[1:25:18] so notice what happens if it could only
[1:25:21] get that nature that spirit to agree
[1:25:23] with him
[1:25:24] then that nature that what a marvel
[1:25:28] how does god talk that nature
[1:25:32] into agreeing with him
[1:25:41] then that nature does
[1:25:44] the nature and the love of the world
[1:25:46] dies and the things of the world is dead
[1:25:49] oh people say
[1:25:50] well this didn't oh this bothers me and
[1:25:52] this bothered me that's
[1:25:53] that's not your problem
[1:25:57] the problem is the love for those things
[1:26:01] if there was no love no love no
[1:26:04] hunger no thirst for those things they
[1:26:07] could be around you
[1:26:09] they could live next door to you look
[1:26:11] friend oh brother donnie oh
[1:26:13] i i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna start a
[1:26:16] petition and i'm gonna see if we can
[1:26:17] burn all the cigarette factory
[1:26:19] smoking bother me all of my life the
[1:26:21] cigarette factories don't need to be
[1:26:23] burned
[1:26:23] what we need to do is burn out that sin
[1:26:25] nature in your soul
[1:26:27] little brother if you live right in the
[1:26:29] middle of winston-salem
[1:26:31] north carolina and there was a tobacco
[1:26:33] process place there and winston was over
[1:26:35] there and salem was over there
[1:26:37] and camel was over there and all the
[1:26:38] rest of them was all around you walk
[1:26:40] right down the middle and say glory
[1:26:42] to god he set me free
[1:26:46] why you got your mask on that old
[1:26:48] tobacco smell it don't bother
[1:26:50] you no more we don't need to send a
[1:26:52] torch lighter
[1:26:53] down there to burn up the bars and the
[1:26:55] honky tonk
[1:26:56] but we need our nature annihilated
[1:27:11] notice he said if you love the world the
[1:27:13] things of the world the love of god
[1:27:16] it's not in you it's so simple it's so
[1:27:19] it's so simple when the love of the
[1:27:22] world which is identified with that
[1:27:24] worldly nature
[1:27:25] is in there it's the king of your being
[1:27:29] so the love of god and the love of the
[1:27:31] world cannot be on the same
[1:27:33] heart it cannot be in the same throne
[1:27:36] room they cannot occupy together god
[1:27:38] will not share his throne
[1:27:39] with anyone else but notice what happens
[1:27:43] when a person is born again
[1:27:45] they may shout they may not they may cry
[1:27:47] they may jump who knows what they'll do
[1:27:49] at the instant that it happens but
[1:27:51] within them that very moment brother jim
[1:27:53] when they die
[1:27:54] and that nature of the world dies inside
[1:27:56] of them listen to me carefully
[1:27:58] they are standing there soulless
[1:28:07] oh god
[1:28:12] for a moment for a second
[1:28:17] the leader of their being is not dead
[1:28:23] so god must quicken
[1:28:28] the seed
[1:28:32] which is the real soul
[1:28:37] so if your soul is the nature of your
[1:28:39] spirit when you're born
[1:28:44] i wonder who your new nature the soul
[1:28:47] you have now wonder whose nature of
[1:28:48] whose spirit
[1:28:50] it is
[1:28:54] glory be to god if your soul was the
[1:28:57] nature of your spirit
[1:28:59] and god had that nature to reason with
[1:29:01] him and
[1:29:02] it died then god quickens
[1:29:06] that seed
[1:29:09] and burst that seed inside of you your
[1:29:12] new nature
[1:29:14] then who is the new nature of your soul
[1:29:19] the almighty
[1:29:25] then you are born again
[1:29:28] born again there's really been a change
[1:29:31] in me
[1:29:32] i got born again just like jesus said
[1:29:37] hallelujah hallelujah i'm talking about
[1:29:41] coming up and shaking the preacher's
[1:29:42] hand
[1:29:43] i'm talking about putting your name on a
[1:29:44] book i'm talking am i just grabbing a
[1:29:46] tape
[1:29:46] and memorizing brother madame's voice
[1:29:48] i'm talking about god you
[1:29:50] and god meeting in the judgment room
[1:29:53] don't you understand what happened
[1:29:54] that your soul met god and god
[1:29:58] annihilated that nature
[1:30:01] hallelujah and in a moment of time he
[1:30:04] breathed the breath
[1:30:05] of life into that predestinated seed
[1:30:08] that he deposited in you when you were
[1:30:10] born
[1:30:18] and then the line wakes up
[1:30:42] you imagine going to sleep
[1:30:49] everything in the jungle shuts up
[1:30:54] and you wake out of a nap
[1:30:57] and you get ready to do it again
[1:31:14] oh what's happened to me
[1:31:19] born again
[1:31:28] it's actually actually new births can be
[1:31:31] will be and should be very
[1:31:34] humiliating
[1:31:40] because you'll never be able to express
[1:31:42] your greatness
[1:31:43] again your royal highness
[1:31:49] you will be known among the lions as the
[1:31:53] pansy
[1:31:55] the weakling the house cat
[1:31:59] oh it used to be like the best of us he
[1:32:01] could drink that vodka he could drink
[1:32:03] old jim crow or turkey or
[1:32:05] daniels or whatever his name is man a
[1:32:06] lot i've seen him kill one after another
[1:32:09] smoke marijuana take pills and
[1:32:11] everything you know what he does now for
[1:32:12] fun
[1:32:13] goes to church and gets whooped on he
[1:32:16] goes to church and gets swooped on
[1:32:18] and he wants me to go with him can you
[1:32:20] imagine me going out there to that crazy
[1:32:22] church
[1:32:22] and letting them not head preacher beat
[1:32:24] on me no way well he's he's apparently
[1:32:27] he's
[1:32:27] absolute weakling praise god
[1:32:32] praise god
[1:32:35] you're proud of the very thing you
[1:32:37] should be ashamed of
[1:32:39] and you're ashamed of the very thing you
[1:32:41] should be proud of
[1:32:43] you ought to be proud that you're not
[1:32:45] like you used to be
[1:32:46] you ought to be so thankful to god
[1:33:00] so this nature has to die
[1:33:05] and the nature of god comes
[1:33:08] and lives in you and god is the only
[1:33:10] thing that it is
[1:33:12] that never did begin or never did end
[1:33:15] this is why it confuses folks even in
[1:33:16] the message
[1:33:17] well but never hear brother branham said
[1:33:18] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:33:21] and that was you
[1:33:29] you of course in your original state
[1:33:37] me and my original state i was part of
[1:33:40] god
[1:33:45] can it go on just a little bit
[1:33:48] so therefore he has partnership you see
[1:33:52] and taken this man earthly and this
[1:33:56] eternal spirit
[1:33:58] and put it together because god
[1:34:01] reflected himself back in that that he
[1:34:03] become
[1:34:04] a man when he become christ jesus
[1:34:08] and he was god see god was in christ
[1:34:12] that lived in him reconciling the world
[1:34:13] to himself
[1:34:14] and through that perfect man each one of
[1:34:17] us
[1:34:17] imperfect that belief in god has
[1:34:20] accepted that
[1:34:22] becomes the perfection
[1:34:26] of him well but brother don't know i pay
[1:34:29] my
[1:34:30] that's that's good but that's not the
[1:34:31] way you become perfect
[1:34:33] you become perfect by accepting his
[1:34:35] perfection
[1:34:37] what's this in jehovah john in 1964 then
[1:34:39] god created man out of the dust of the
[1:34:41] earth
[1:34:42] and made him in the form of an animal
[1:34:47] and y'all ever skinned a seen a bare
[1:34:49] skin out
[1:34:50] a bear since paul it's amazing how much
[1:34:54] look like a human
[1:34:56] it's amazing the different parts of
[1:34:57] animals that you look at human beings
[1:34:59] unless you really know what you're
[1:35:00] looking at you think it's a human part
[1:35:02] why god made the image reflect from the
[1:35:05] animal kingdom
[1:35:06] right inside the head of the race man
[1:35:10] so when the men christ jesus come on the
[1:35:12] earth his hair looked like air hair
[1:35:14] his eyes look like our eyes his hands
[1:35:16] look like our hands
[1:35:18] but he come carrying the soul of god
[1:35:21] the embodiment of god to release
[1:35:25] his soul
[1:35:32] we're mammal that's warm blooded
[1:35:36] animal we're in that image
[1:35:39] of animal life that's your ishmael
[1:35:48] question answer is 1964 in human is an
[1:35:51] animal
[1:35:52] the man the flesh part notice where he
[1:35:55] puts the tents
[1:35:56] not was is animal flesh
[1:35:59] we know that we are mammals so don't get
[1:36:02] mad at me for saying brother branham was
[1:36:03] brother branham said he himself
[1:36:05] was an animal a mammal which is
[1:36:08] warm-blooded animal we
[1:36:10] know that but what makes a difference
[1:36:13] the animal does not have the inward soul
[1:36:15] but the human does
[1:36:16] he don't know right from wrong
[1:36:21] friends can't you see when the spirit of
[1:36:23] god is off of human beings
[1:36:26] look out here look out here at our race
[1:36:29] look out here at our generation look at
[1:36:31] the time they're in people are doing
[1:36:33] things we never thought possible for a
[1:36:35] human being to do
[1:36:36] take the spirit of god off of a man he's
[1:36:39] lower than a bear
[1:36:41] he's lower than a hog he's lower than a
[1:36:43] dog
[1:36:45] come on friends there won't be no dogs
[1:36:47] in hell
[1:36:48] think about it there'll be no animals in
[1:36:51] hell
[1:36:53] why they cannot sin they will never be
[1:36:56] thrown into the lake of fire no
[1:36:58] they cannot sin but think of the human
[1:37:01] beings the height of the animals
[1:37:04] why will they be in hell because they
[1:37:07] have a soul
[1:37:09] to know right from wrong and the spirit
[1:37:12] of god
[1:37:13] moves on that nature trying to get it to
[1:37:16] die and they say no
[1:37:17] no i'm not ready
[1:37:21] i'm not ready i don't want to
[1:37:24] leave me alone god
[1:37:29] that decision will haunt them for the
[1:37:32] ages
[1:37:34] aren't you glad one day god helped you
[1:37:38] to accept that let's stand together i
[1:37:41] got way too much to go on into let's
[1:37:46] stop
[1:37:52] you see the truth of it is this the all
[1:37:55] nature is so vile
[1:37:58] and so corrupt it can never be redeemed
[1:38:02] it could never be sanctified and the new
[1:38:06] nature is so sinless
[1:38:08] it don't need to be sanctified because
[1:38:10] it is your own representation from the
[1:38:12] presence of god
[1:38:14] what is the work of sanctification that
[1:38:16] goes on in us
[1:38:17] it ain't your soul it's your body
[1:38:21] this is why in future homie tells us
[1:38:23] that a person comes to justification and
[1:38:24] then they move to sanctification and it
[1:38:26] sets your mind
[1:38:28] toward holiness so whenever you're
[1:38:29] getting sanctified what are you doing
[1:38:31] you're taking these clothes out of your
[1:38:32] cause you're getting rid of this music
[1:38:34] you're doing this why
[1:38:35] because it caters to this so the state
[1:38:39] of sanctification bears over
[1:38:41] on the life that you live every day
[1:38:44] praise god
[1:38:46] because the soul once the soul gets the
[1:38:48] holy ghost do we maintain our
[1:38:49] sanctification we do
[1:38:51] we still live a sanctified separate lie
[1:38:54] why
[1:38:54] you can't trust this animal they're
[1:38:57] either one of us here friends
[1:38:59] that if we let our flesh do whatever it
[1:39:01] wants to do we'll be in a mess of
[1:39:02] trouble
[1:39:03] including the pastor deacons trustees
[1:39:05] song leader
[1:39:06] everybody here your flesh is
[1:39:10] an animal quit catering to it quit
[1:39:13] babying it quit accepting it as the
[1:39:16] promised seed
[1:39:19] it is your enemy not your friend
[1:39:29] that's power he is
[1:39:33] oh my
[1:39:36] lord jesus
[1:39:40] i pray today father that you would help
[1:39:42] us
[1:39:44] i know we've covered a lot of territory
[1:39:48] may they ruminate lord maybe they go
[1:39:49] back and they listen to a
[1:39:51] time or two or three or four or whatever
[1:39:55] lord if there's one standing here today
[1:39:58] they've accepted you as their savior and
[1:40:01] all of it's
[1:40:02] been from a mental standpoint but really
[1:40:05] their nature has never
[1:40:07] reasoned and agreed with you and there
[1:40:09] as it reasoned
[1:40:11] you took its life on the altar
[1:40:16] then lord god you breathed into that
[1:40:19] seed
[1:40:21] the breath of life
[1:40:24] no wonder the prophet could say you
[1:40:26] never sinned in the first place
[1:40:29] i used to listen to that invisible union
[1:40:31] lord and
[1:40:32] i i just i miss the point
[1:40:35] i missed the point of what he was saying
[1:40:40] whenever he'd say if you heard i got
[1:40:42] drunk
[1:40:43] and i've done all these evil things and
[1:40:46] then you found out
[1:40:48] i didn't do it and then you'd say
[1:40:51] brother branham
[1:40:52] i forgive you and he said forgive me
[1:40:57] i never did it in the first place
[1:41:00] lord we realize many of us what we've
[1:41:02] looked at the new births
[1:41:04] is that old man that old nature we go up
[1:41:07] to the altar and they beat us on the
[1:41:09] back or whatever more
[1:41:11] and you forgive that on nature we try to
[1:41:13] bring that old nature in line we bring
[1:41:15] him to church we try to put into
[1:41:16] sanctification
[1:41:19] that ain't your process at all you ain't
[1:41:22] trying to save that old man
[1:41:24] you want to kill him
[1:41:28] help us
[1:41:31] oh jesus thank you for my new person
[1:41:37] lord god i thank you for all i've seen
[1:41:39] you do
[1:41:41] i'm one little bitty old tiny guy that's
[1:41:44] done hardly nothing for you but yet lord
[1:41:48] i can say i've seen you
[1:41:51] do such miraculous things as far as
[1:41:53] healings
[1:41:55] i've seen you lord god do many
[1:41:58] tremendous things
[1:42:00] and i appreciate all of that but lord
[1:42:03] the greatest miracle to this date
[1:42:06] is me being born again
[1:42:09] no doubt many of those people that i've
[1:42:11] prayed for that you performed a miracle
[1:42:13] on they'll get sick again and no doubt
[1:42:15] many of them are already died
[1:42:17] but lord god that miracle of the new
[1:42:20] birth
[1:42:22] can never die praise god
[1:42:27] help us here today lord jesus
[1:42:31] maybe get a true understanding the new
[1:42:34] birth is not trying to
[1:42:36] save and sanctify and put the holy ghost
[1:42:39] in that old man
[1:42:40] the holy ghost won't go in that old man
[1:42:44] he's got today to die and make room
[1:42:47] for the new man
[1:42:50] no wonder the prophet said a soul of god
[1:42:54] that was in god
[1:43:00] so what i was born with was not that
[1:43:02] part that was in
[1:43:03] god it was the nature of my spirit
[1:43:08] being crossbred between satan and eve
[1:43:12] oh lord thank you jesus
[1:43:18] i don't i'm not even sure lord when it
[1:43:20] was it really did that
[1:43:22] i know you changed me that night down at
[1:43:24] the altar that little hole in this
[1:43:26] church
[1:43:28] something happened to me now i know lord
[1:43:30] when i went up and prayed for the holy
[1:43:32] ghost i know something happened to me
[1:43:34] but lord i was still so wrong
[1:43:37] not sure lord if it's when i come to the
[1:43:41] message after i come to the message
[1:43:43] what tape us listen to what sermon i
[1:43:45] share i don't know
[1:43:46] but all i know is i'm not the same man i
[1:43:49] was and i was in pentecost
[1:43:52] thank you lord jesus i appreciate it
[1:43:56] lord with all of my heart
[1:44:00] lord god may your breath
[1:44:04] glory to god may your breasts
[1:44:08] come through this place today those that
[1:44:12] are out streaming
[1:44:13] no matter where they'd be around the

[1:44:26] time zones i'll listen to it today
[1:44:28] lord god while we're praying together
[1:44:32] may the breath of god come through that
[1:44:34] little hut in africa
[1:44:36] that place lord god where they're
[1:44:38] sitting there maybe in a library
[1:44:40] because they don't have internet in
[1:44:41] their home may the breath of god
[1:44:44] pass through that cafe hallelujah
[1:44:47] embarrass that black man sitting there
[1:44:49] lord god that black woman
[1:44:51] that indian lord god in madras wherever
[1:44:53] they live
[1:44:55] lord jesus we call upon your mighty name
[1:45:00] may you open up this lion
[1:45:04] this donkey this prideful
[1:45:07] peacock
[1:45:10] that you put us to sleep as it were
[1:45:13] and when we wake we'll not awaken our
[1:45:16] pride
[1:45:17] but that peacock will awake in genuine
[1:45:20] humility
[1:45:23] that donkey that went to sleep so
[1:45:25] stubborn and so hard-headed nobody could
[1:45:27] ever tell them nothing
[1:45:29] but they'll awake with a lamb nature
[1:45:32] or they'll still deal with that old
[1:45:34] donkey part
[1:45:35] but now they've got a power to bring it
[1:45:37] subject
[1:45:39] praise god help us jesus

[1:46:07] turmoil our world and sets turmoil
[1:46:11] lord you see what the scientists are
[1:46:12] saying about our pandemic
[1:46:15] of them not thinking it's going to get
[1:46:16] better for a while but it's going to get
[1:46:18] worse

[1:46:47] just to worship him a little bit we've
[1:46:48] got a little sister that's
[1:46:50] going to be baptized to dave by the way
[1:46:54] they'll come prepare for that
[1:46:58] listen what what brother branham said
[1:47:00] let me read to you brother
[1:47:01] jump over to the lamb and the dove just
[1:47:03] a couple pages over
[1:47:05] if you want to be a christian just ask
[1:47:07] christ
[1:47:09] he will take your old nature out
[1:47:13] and put a new nature in then you don't
[1:47:15] have to impersonate anything
[1:47:18] it's just your normal life that you're
[1:47:21] living
[1:47:22] as long as you've got malice envy and
[1:47:24] strife and all these things in the world
[1:47:26] then you know christ isn't there look
[1:47:28] people think the things of the world are
[1:47:30] just drinking
[1:47:31] smoking dope popping pills look friends
[1:47:34] when you have
[1:47:35] envy and strife and hatred that preceded
[1:47:39] smoking
[1:47:40] that was before there was ever one drop
[1:47:42] of alcohol
[1:47:43] being worldly and having worldly things
[1:47:46] in you is not just drinking and smoking
[1:47:48] and committing adultery on your wife
[1:47:52] notice this if you love the world the
[1:47:53] things of the world the love of god's
[1:47:55] not even in you see because the life of
[1:47:56] god is in he
[1:47:58] the life is in there it just produces
[1:48:02] itself it just lives its way out
[1:48:06] let me read one more in hebrews your old
[1:48:09] nature
[1:48:10] died the nature of the world
[1:48:15] and you become
[1:48:18] a new creation so you imagine
[1:48:22] that was a death and a birth
[1:48:26] almost at the same time look at the time
[1:48:28] we're living in
[1:48:30] people dying all around us and births
[1:48:33] happening every day
[1:48:35] people are dying and people are being
[1:48:38] born
[1:48:39] that's the miracle of the new birth that
[1:48:41] your nature dies
[1:48:43] and once it's dead
[1:48:47] and about the speed of a twinkling of an
[1:48:49] eye maybe
[1:48:53] your new nature your new person is
[1:48:58] resurrected
[1:49:00] praise god
[1:49:03] sing waters on your heart

[1:53:41] with your theophany in the body change
[1:53:45] and your animal mammal body
[1:53:48] will be changed into a body like unto
[1:53:52] his
[1:53:52] own glorious body and it does not yet
[1:53:55] appear what we shall be
[1:53:56] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:53:59] shall be like him
[1:54:01] for we shall see him as he is
[1:54:05] the lord jesus body you imagine there
[1:54:08] in the tomb he wasn't just brought back
[1:54:11] to life
[1:54:13] but he was changed he died a
[1:54:16] 33 year old man but he looked like 50
[1:54:20] but that was not the raised body that

[1:54:58] speak
[1:55:00] and the rapture will take place our
[1:55:02] bodies will be transformed
[1:55:04] into spoken word bodies

[1:55:11] into the theophany what happens
[1:55:13] you bring the theophany you bring the
[1:55:16] theophany
