[46:50] nope
[46:54] [Music]
[46:56] no matter what gets in your way
[47:19] I read a quote before I come out here
[47:21] brother Andrew
[47:23] whoever had had posted
[47:25] so brother Branham said in 56 and
[47:28] God has provided away
[47:30] he said you look at all the
[47:33] what they went through in the Old
[47:34] Testament they escaped the edge of the
[47:36] sword their dead was raised
[47:39] he said you can do that too if you take
[47:41] the same road
[47:44] he said that was he said you said that
[47:46] was the Bible Way
[47:47] that's what they did in the Bible
[47:49] said we're still in the Bible Way yeah
[47:53] why did he say pray and read your Bible
[47:55] every day
[47:57] because you're in the Bible Way
[47:59] you are the living Bible
[48:03] as you're going to find out today if
[48:05] you've never ever heard how much of the
[48:06] Bible you are
[48:08] after today you have no excuse
[48:13] because I have got bruises and stripes
[48:16] and
[48:18] man I have fell short
[48:23] so
[48:25] don't get mad at the messenger
[48:29] Jimmy while ago and I told
[48:31] Tim Murray Friday night I said brother
[48:33] Donnie heard I was preaching so he went
[48:35] to Gatlinburg
[48:36] [Laughter]
[48:40] I wish he'd took me with him
[48:44] but we're glad to see but they don't
[48:45] want to get some rest yeah he's
[48:48] he's worked and worked and worked
[48:50] he's put in a lot of time over there
[48:55] he might not tell you but he's getting
[48:57] old I watch him walk out the other day I
[49:00] thought who is that man
[49:01] it didn't look like the same guy that
[49:03] stood up here 30 years ago
[49:07] but for him it's a labor of love
[49:12] look I go I don't I've done nothing
[49:15] there right near as much work over there
[49:17] as everybody else
[49:19] uh but I go over there I see them
[49:21] brothers working
[49:23] I'm sorry if I'm taking up your my
[49:25] preaching time I'll cut it short
[49:27] I always do anyway so
[49:30] watching Brothers work
[49:33] and you can tell by the spirit their
[49:36] attitude
[49:37] that they love what they're doing
[49:39] you know I've often thought
[49:42] people that would say I can't believe
[49:43] you're doing this you're building this
[49:45] you're doing that and all that everybody
[49:46] knows it that knows brother Donnie
[49:48] brother Donnie does anything until he's
[49:50] led up the Lord
[49:52] because I remember
[49:54] the brothers came to brother Donny about
[49:55] 25 years ago to do this
[49:57] to build this church and he's said they
[50:00] didn't feel the leading of the Lord to
[50:01] do it
[50:03] so just be careful what you say
[50:07] when you've got a man of God that is
[50:09] doing something
[50:11] I promise you he's doing it prayerfully
[50:15] prayerfully
[50:17] and he's doing it for you he ain't doing
[50:18] it for himself
[50:21] he he loves his he loves God's people
[50:25] so if you have your Bibles and you want
[50:28] to turn with me to Mark chapter 16.
[50:33] if anybody sees anything wrong with my
[50:35] suit this morning
[50:36] my wife tried to dress me but she didn't
[50:41] so
[50:42] I got some looks on the way here
[50:46] I'm not up on fashion sorry
[50:50] she won't post no pictures of me though
[50:52] I guarantee you with this song
[50:54] so anyways let's go to work
[50:58] after he had appeared in another form
[51:00] onto two of them as they walked
[51:02] into the country and they went and told
[51:05] it unto the residue neither believe they
[51:07] them
[51:09] they didn't believe when he said we saw
[51:11] him
[51:12] they didn't believe him
[51:14] afterward he appeared unto the leaven as
[51:16] they sat at meat and uprighted him with
[51:18] for their unbelief
[51:20] and their Hardness of Heart because they
[51:22] believe on they believe not on them that
[51:25] had seen him after he was risen
[51:30] people are going to see Christ in you
[51:35] what we're going to talk about today is
[51:37] go tell the world
[51:39] that's the title go tell the world
[51:43] because you are the message
[51:45] you are the message
[51:47] people are not going to believe you
[51:51] people are not going to believe you
[51:52] there's some that will believe you just
[51:54] by watching your life your life will
[51:58] bring people into this message
[52:01] without you even opening your mouth
[52:07] that's the Bible Way
[52:11] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[52:14] world and preach the gospel to every
[52:18] creature
[52:20] that means a creature in here today
[52:22] this message was preached to you or you
[52:25] would have not been here
[52:28] there's many of you or most of you are
[52:30] here because someone that carried this
[52:33] message that lived this message
[52:36] expressed it to you and here you are
[52:40] and it wasn't a preacher
[52:43] many of you are here because someone
[52:45] that wasn't a preacher
[52:48] lived a life in front of you
[52:50] if that seed that was in you
[52:53] was never there
[52:56] that deep calm to the Deep on that
[52:58] person whose life that influenced you
[53:00] would never influence you
[53:02] we'll look at that further on but
[53:04] there has to be a life in there to
[53:06] respond to a life
[53:09] does that make sense
[53:11] you know me I don't get deep I'm just
[53:13] real simple
[53:14] it's about our heads
[53:17] Heavenly Father we're so grateful for
[53:18] another day Lord
[53:20] another day Lord to sit around your word
[53:24] Lord we know so many times we've heard
[53:27] Lord this is the House of Correction
[53:30] and Lord we receive that but sometimes
[53:32] this is also the house of blessing this
[53:35] is the house of Praise this is the house
[53:37] of worship
[53:39] Lord I Hope in today's sermon father
[53:41] even if we get correction
[53:42] help us to give you praise help us to
[53:45] worship help us to get blessings Lord
[53:48] lord it's not always just about coming
[53:50] and hearing and and making sure that our
[53:54] lives are just straight and narrow Lord
[53:56] but that's part of it
[53:58] but it's also sometimes Lord
[54:01] it's time to give Glory back to you to
[54:04] give praise and worship back to you
[54:06] because you are the only one that is
[54:07] worthy of that
[54:09] may we do that this morning we advise
[54:11] you Lord help me to get out of the way
[54:13] Lord is as I put these notes together
[54:15] and I sit back there I study them over
[54:17] and I've studied them again
[54:19] and getting ready to come out here just
[54:21] seems like it all goes blank
[54:23] ministers here can tell you that that's
[54:25] how it happens you think you you have it
[54:27] how you're going to do it on your notes
[54:28] and then you walk out it all goes blank
[54:31] but Lord if I have to go blank so you
[54:33] can feel that void
[54:35] Lord may it happen
[54:37] may you speak to us this morning Lord
[54:40] Lord anything that would hinder our
[54:42] lives may be push it out any criticism
[54:45] any anything Lord any bitterness Lord
[54:47] that we if we would come in here and say
[54:49] give me something show me something lord
[54:52] I can't give them anything
[54:54] but Lord you can give them you that's
[54:57] what we're going to look at this morning
[54:58] how you have given you to us
[55:00] we thank you for that bless your people
[55:02] Lord in Jesus name amen you can be
[55:04] seated
[55:07] as I said the title that I've given this
[55:10] is go tell the world and Jesus tells him
[55:12] go eat in all the world and preach the
[55:14] gospel of every creature he wasn't
[55:15] talking just to the disciples
[55:19] that is your commission that is my
[55:21] commission you have a commission
[55:24] your commission is not go Sunday
[55:26] Wednesday and go and listen to the
[55:28] preacher and receive the word
[55:29] I'm going to read you a quote that I
[55:31] found last night that just totally
[55:32] floored me brother Brandon said our job
[55:35] is
[55:36] your job is
[55:41] brother Graham says in question and
[55:42] answers
[55:44] now you remember what I said last Sunday
[55:46] you are a preacher get a Pulpit
[55:49] if you're not live your sermon
[55:52] see that's the best way to do that live
[55:54] your sermon he says it again if you're a
[55:57] preacher get a Pulpit and go to
[55:59] preaching
[56:00] if you're not just live your sermon
[56:04] let your life be your pulpit
[56:08] I don't I think that takes care of a
[56:11] whole lot
[56:12] don't you
[56:14] and you say brother Joe what am I
[56:15] supposed to preach
[56:16] you know we've got preachers all in the
[56:19] message
[56:22] we have to put quotations beside the
[56:24] message now
[56:25] because there's so many versions so many
[56:27] so many opinions
[56:29] so many ideas
[56:31] but there's God still has some God
[56:34] called men that are still in the Bible
[56:37] Way
[56:38] that are still teaching the message as
[56:40] The Seventh-Day messenger who brought it
[56:42] yeah you know the other night I was
[56:45] listening brother Jackie's saying bro
[56:46] I'll tell you what brother Jackie
[56:49] I don't know where to start
[56:52] about brother Jackie
[56:55] brother Jackie his no doubt LED
[56:57] thousands thousands
[57:00] of people to the Lord
[57:02] and influenced Millions
[57:07] but Brothers Jackie his life has said
[57:10] more than every single sermon he's ever
[57:13] preached
[57:14] his life
[57:17] has said more than any one any any
[57:19] message that he ever preached brother
[57:20] Jackie could never preach one sermon
[57:24] that would be better than the life that
[57:26] he lived
[57:28] God still has those
[57:32] well brother Jackie has done is what you
[57:34] and I are supposed to do
[57:37] not going to the jungles where no man's
[57:39] Gone Going Places where and take the
[57:42] gospel to people that nobody's ever
[57:44] heard where they've never heard it that
[57:46] ain't what our job is
[57:48] God didn't call us
[57:50] God didn't call us to go spread the
[57:52] gospel around the world
[57:55] but he called us to spread the gospel
[58:00] so what is the gospel
[58:04] the gospel is by definition it is the
[58:07] good news the Glad Tidings that what
[58:09] we're told it's the Glad Tidings which
[58:11] you know the in the New Testament you
[58:13] said they want to spread the gospel the
[58:15] Glad Tidings of Christ
[58:17] that was what they were commissioned to
[58:19] do
[58:20] to testify what Christ has done in your
[58:22] life
[58:24] Bill Brown said question and answers
[58:26] this is the one that I found last night
[58:28] while I was studying and said since a
[58:30] child I've always known that there was a
[58:32] god
[58:33] and though there was something happening
[58:35] in my life and that's beyond any
[58:37] question
[58:38] but let me say this
[58:41] there will come a message
[58:44] and there will come a messenger
[58:47] I believe that if it is to be a man
[58:50] it'll be somebody after me and don't let
[58:53] that stumble you
[58:56] he said if
[59:00] if
[59:01] there will come a message after me if
[59:05] don't put a period there and stop
[59:08] we've got too many periods on too many
[59:10] quotes
[59:11] don't put a period there and stop
[59:16] I believe if the it's to be a man it'll
[59:19] be somebody after me
[59:20] but this message that I'm preaching
[59:23] is the true message of this day
[59:26] and it's the last message
[59:34] you see what I'm doing brother
[59:36] I'm putting you all
[59:38] in the same place I am
[59:43] the same
[59:44] place
[59:49] you are messengers of this same message
[59:54] there you are your commission go do it
[59:56] we can dismiss
[59:59] that's your commission
[1:00:01] God's going to hold you to that
[1:00:05] you are to preach the same message he
[1:00:07] preached with your life
[1:00:09] you are to be a messenger of this last
[1:00:12] age message
[1:00:15] you've got no excuse
[1:00:19] so if Christ has set us about in your
[1:00:21] heart your life will scream louder than
[1:00:23] any words you can say
[1:00:26] there's nothing you can say
[1:00:28] there's nothing I can say this morning
[1:00:32] that could say anything louder than the
[1:00:34] Life of Christ in my life in your life
[1:00:36] you can witness to people you can you
[1:00:39] can tell them this you can tell them
[1:00:40] that
[1:00:42] they're going to watch your life when
[1:00:43] you be careful when you witness to
[1:00:45] somebody
[1:00:47] be careful that whenever you witness to
[1:00:49] somebody you're living what you're
[1:00:50] witnessing to
[1:00:52] when you tell people this is where I go
[1:00:54] to church this is my pastor this is what
[1:00:57] I believe I believe in the in The
[1:00:58] Seventh-Day messenger Malachi 4 and 5.
[1:01:03] and they go find books they go find
[1:01:05] messages they start streaming your
[1:01:06] church
[1:01:07] and then they watch you at work
[1:01:10] they watch your life are they seeing
[1:01:12] what you said you belong to
[1:01:16] that's the message of this age
[1:01:18] that's the message that we're supposed
[1:01:20] to be telling other people
[1:01:23] how can you bring other people in If You
[1:01:25] Don't Preach to them
[1:01:26] now be careful everything I say today
[1:01:29] don't cross it up with me talking about
[1:01:30] using your mouth
[1:01:35] when you get up in the morning
[1:01:37] you should be ready to preach
[1:01:41] without opening your mouth
[1:01:46] my son's over here and he's he's finding
[1:01:48] out ways to mimic me when I get home
[1:01:54] he does
[1:01:55] he makes fun of me so well don't make
[1:01:57] fun of me but he mimics me dad you do
[1:01:59] this
[1:02:02] I hope every one of y'all get one like
[1:02:04] Kim
[1:02:07] ah
[1:02:12] don't confuse
[1:02:14] the message with your beliefs
[1:02:19] do not confuse this message with your
[1:02:23] beliefs
[1:02:27] people let their beliefs guide them they
[1:02:30] love their beliefs
[1:02:31] they love their opinions of this message
[1:02:33] they love their opinions of God they
[1:02:34] love their opinions of you they love
[1:02:36] their opinions of people and that what
[1:02:38] leads them that what what do you think
[1:02:40] we've got radicals today in politics and
[1:02:42] all that radicals because they love
[1:02:43] their beliefs
[1:02:45] they love their beliefs they don't love
[1:02:46] their God
[1:02:48] if you love God you will let God guide
[1:02:50] you instead of your beliefs
[1:02:53] don't let your beliefs your beliefs some
[1:02:55] many times beliefs come with the wrong
[1:02:58] spirit
[1:03:02] that's the Muslims
[1:03:06] comes with the wrong spirit
[1:03:09] and they believe 100 that what they're
[1:03:12] doing is right they believe it that's
[1:03:14] the message that's the message they're
[1:03:16] preaching with their lives
[1:03:18] just their beliefs
[1:03:20] don't confuse what you believe as far as
[1:03:23] I hope these beliefs you know in my
[1:03:25] heart this is what I believe and I
[1:03:26] believe I believe that let God guide you
[1:03:29] sometimes your beliefs and your opinions
[1:03:31] might be wrong
[1:03:36] why do you think Peter cut off the guy's
[1:03:38] ear
[1:03:40] Peter's beliefs
[1:03:43] this was God's Almighty son right here
[1:03:47] and nobody was going to take him
[1:03:50] that was Peter's beliefs this you're not
[1:03:52] going to take him you're not going to
[1:03:54] kill him you're not he's not he don't
[1:03:55] have to die
[1:03:57] that was Peter's beliefs
[1:03:59] when he he told him you know that he had
[1:04:01] to to die they didn't want to believe it
[1:04:04] but that was their beliefs
[1:04:07] God's beliefs God's way don't line up
[1:04:09] with our beliefs sometimes
[1:04:11] the scripture that I read you this
[1:04:12] morning go into all the world and preach
[1:04:14] the gospel for years even as an adult
[1:04:18] I thought before before I was called to
[1:04:20] preach I thought I had to go find people
[1:04:23] and witness to them well they liked it
[1:04:25] or not
[1:04:28] that's true that was my belief
[1:04:31] I believe that's what I had to do was to
[1:04:34] tell people
[1:04:35] that hey if you heard of brother Branham
[1:04:40] you know introducing to people this
[1:04:42] message with that tactic of telling them
[1:04:44] about brother Brandon has turned many
[1:04:45] people away
[1:04:47] many people away
[1:04:50] whether brother Branham come to do Point
[1:04:52] him to Christ
[1:04:53] so we're supposed to be preaching the
[1:04:55] same message that he preached Point him
[1:04:58] to Christ
[1:05:01] hahaha
[1:05:04] being zealous of your beliefs brings
[1:05:06] wrong Spirit many times
[1:05:09] being led by the holy spirit will never
[1:05:11] lead you wrong never brings the wrong
[1:05:13] spirit
[1:05:17] Revelation 12 10.
[1:05:21] I heard a loud voice
[1:05:23] saying in heaven
[1:05:25] now has come salvation and strength the
[1:05:27] kingdom of our God the power of of
[1:05:29] Christ for the accuser of our Brothers
[1:05:30] cast down which accused them before God
[1:05:32] before our God day and night and they
[1:05:36] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by
[1:05:39] the word of their testimony and they
[1:05:42] loved not their lives unto death
[1:05:46] this was the Bible Way
[1:05:50] they loved
[1:05:52] not their own lives unto death that was
[1:05:54] the Bible Way you say that was in the
[1:05:56] Bible that was the martyrs
[1:05:58] we're in the Bible Way
[1:06:00] but I got to looking at that and said by
[1:06:02] the word of their testimony
[1:06:04] and I looked in John we've read John 1 1
[1:06:07] the beginning of the word was with in
[1:06:08] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:06:10] with God and the Word was God
[1:06:13] if you look in the Greek it's the same
[1:06:15] in the word of their testimony and in
[1:06:17] the Word was God is the same word
[1:06:23] so what was the word of their testimony
[1:06:26] it was God
[1:06:28] what is the word of your testimony
[1:06:32] it's God it always is
[1:06:35] he will always be your testimony
[1:06:39] that's how you live your life by God
[1:06:43] so the word
[1:06:44] became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:06:47] right but what did what did the word
[1:06:49] when he become flesh what did he say I
[1:06:51] go away but how come again
[1:06:54] and I'll be with you even in you to the
[1:06:57] end of the world
[1:06:58] what else did he say Greater Works than
[1:07:01] this shall you do you say I've never
[1:07:03] raised the death you might you your life
[1:07:06] might have raised somebody that was
[1:07:07] spiritually dead
[1:07:10] it's not all about going out to a
[1:07:12] funeral and standing over a coffin and
[1:07:13] praying and raising somebody up
[1:07:19] you're better off
[1:07:21] dead in the flesh
[1:07:23] and have God
[1:07:25] than to be spiritually dead
[1:07:28] it's a greater work to raise somebody
[1:07:30] that's spiritually dead
[1:07:33] it's a greater work
[1:07:35] because the one that's laying here
[1:07:38] in the coffin that's not him anyway
[1:07:40] that's not her anyway
[1:07:42] they've received ultimate healing
[1:07:46] but your life
[1:07:48] the life you live
[1:07:51] there's many of you in here could can
[1:07:53] get up and testify right now about
[1:07:54] people coming up to you and asking you
[1:07:56] where do you go to church
[1:07:59] what do you believe this that
[1:08:02] different things in your life because
[1:08:03] they watched you
[1:08:06] what did they watch they watched your
[1:08:08] sermon
[1:08:09] they heard your life
[1:08:13] they heard your life
[1:08:16] your life is speaking
[1:08:18] if we realize that when we get up in the
[1:08:20] morning that when I walk out the door
[1:08:22] and I go to school and I go to work
[1:08:25] and I go here and I go there
[1:08:28] people are going to hear your life
[1:08:33] you think maybe that might make us more
[1:08:35] weary of how we Act
[1:08:38] how we treat others
[1:08:40] how we treat our family our wives our
[1:08:42] husbands our kids
[1:08:44] because people are watching
[1:08:47] is the life that you're living at home
[1:08:49] the same life that you're living in
[1:08:51] front of people
[1:08:53] are you living the same life
[1:08:55] are you preaching at home what you're
[1:08:57] preaching to people where you work with
[1:09:00] is your wife looking you as the message
[1:09:04] being spoke is your husband looking at
[1:09:07] you as the message that's being spoke
[1:09:09] come on
[1:09:12] a messenger of this message is a 24 7
[1:09:16] Commission
[1:09:18] 365. there's no days off
[1:09:21] there's no days off
[1:09:30] I got the when I got the stadiums I got
[1:09:32] to thinking
[1:09:34] your life is two books
[1:09:37] two books
[1:09:39] we look at it many times as the old man
[1:09:40] and the new man
[1:09:45] God wrote a book about you before the
[1:09:47] foundation of the world
[1:09:49] that book has no beginning and no ending
[1:09:54] it always will be there
[1:09:58] but Satan's kept a book of you too
[1:10:01] when you took your first breath he began
[1:10:03] to writing
[1:10:04] you say not me brother Joe I was raised
[1:10:07] in a Christian home I've served God all
[1:10:09] my life
[1:10:10] let me tell you a little chapter in your
[1:10:13] book
[1:10:15] that Satan's got
[1:10:18] you came into the world speaking lies
[1:10:21] born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:10:24] you came from a sin birth because the
[1:10:26] result direct result of the Fall
[1:10:30] right all the mistakes and failures in
[1:10:34] your life you think God has those in his
[1:10:35] book
[1:10:38] when God looks at Satan's book of your
[1:10:40] life it's blank
[1:10:42] God can't read Satan's book of you
[1:10:46] he can't
[1:10:50] he has to look through the blood right
[1:10:53] so when I just read to you that he is
[1:10:55] the accuser of the brethren day and
[1:10:58] night
[1:10:59] he is going before God with your book in
[1:11:01] his hand and saying look at this chapter
[1:11:03] look at this page where he done this
[1:11:05] where she done that
[1:11:08] God says that looks like all empty pages
[1:11:10] to me
[1:11:12] I don't see nothing
[1:11:16] but that's still your book
[1:11:18] I still got your name on it your Earthly
[1:11:21] name
[1:11:23] God's got one with your Eternal name on
[1:11:25] it
[1:11:26] Satan don't want to see that one
[1:11:34] he's accuser of the brethren
[1:11:37] and so many times in our life we revert
[1:11:40] back to a page in Satan's book
[1:11:43] we make a mistake we fall
[1:11:47] this book will always be there
[1:11:49] you get saved get the whole field of the
[1:11:51] Holy Ghost that book's still there
[1:11:53] it's still there you say well I I killed
[1:11:56] the old man you're still dragging him
[1:11:57] around
[1:11:58] he might be dead but you're dragging him
[1:12:00] around yeah
[1:12:02] if y'all if y'all have if you don't
[1:12:04] understand that brother Donnie preached
[1:12:05] a sermon many years ago
[1:12:08] am I dragging that old Roman soldier
[1:12:10] around
[1:12:11] right
[1:12:13] go back and listen to it I can't preach
[1:12:14] the way he preached it but I can tell
[1:12:15] you you're dragging an old man around
[1:12:18] he might be dead
[1:12:19] but he stinks
[1:12:23] and you know he's there
[1:12:26] and sometimes that old stinky nature
[1:12:28] wants to rise up sometimes
[1:12:31] every once in a while we put an AED on
[1:12:33] him right
[1:12:35] we try to resuscitate him
[1:12:38] we do
[1:12:39] you say brother Joe how do you do that
[1:12:42] well
[1:12:44] where should we start
[1:12:46] when Satan pulls out a little page of
[1:12:48] you if you remember when you did this
[1:12:50] and you like oh Lord I forgot
[1:12:53] or you think it was something way back
[1:12:55] in the day and it was really cool how
[1:12:57] you did this
[1:12:59] and you start talking about the old
[1:13:00] things you did how you did that how you
[1:13:02] did this what I did when I was in the
[1:13:04] bar when I did when I was in the world
[1:13:08] all the things that you did you start
[1:13:10] talking about them like you know hey the
[1:13:12] devil takes a page of your book all the
[1:13:14] time and gets you to read it all the
[1:13:16] time
[1:13:18] he's a messenger too
[1:13:20] he's got a job
[1:13:22] he's got a message to preach to you
[1:13:26] you think he's going to say they got the
[1:13:28] Holy Ghost
[1:13:29] can't bother them
[1:13:30] he's right but God allows him
[1:13:34] Satan can only do to you what God allows
[1:13:39] don't ever forget that
[1:13:41] he don't have free reign at you anytime
[1:13:42] he wants
[1:13:43] go back and read Joe you'll understand
[1:13:54] what will our book read
[1:13:57] to others
[1:14:00] let's say we're expressing
[1:14:02] these two books in our life
[1:14:06] those you work with
[1:14:08] which book are they reading
[1:14:11] your wife
[1:14:13] just bring it home
[1:14:15] what book is your wife reading about you
[1:14:18] husbands
[1:14:19] what's she reading
[1:14:22] could she look at your life
[1:14:25] and say
[1:14:26] that lines up right with the message
[1:14:30] that lines up with exactly what what the
[1:14:32] prophet said
[1:14:34] his life
[1:14:36] the way he treats me the way he treats
[1:14:39] the kids
[1:14:42] let me tell you explain something to you
[1:14:44] there's no third book
[1:14:46] there's no third book
[1:14:48] there's not a book that's your way
[1:14:51] so if you was doing something wrong say
[1:14:53] if you was a
[1:14:54] a deadbeat dad
[1:14:57] whatever I hope nobody here is
[1:15:01] he had another kids nothing to do with
[1:15:02] your wife
[1:15:04] it's just the way you were and say your
[1:15:06] pastor called you in and wanted to talk
[1:15:08] to you about it
[1:15:10] and he accused you of
[1:15:13] living out Satan's book and you would
[1:15:14] say no there's no way no way what can
[1:15:17] you honestly say that you're not living
[1:15:19] it the way the message the message that
[1:15:20] God sent you to live it no I can't say
[1:15:22] that but I'm not
[1:15:24] there's no middle
[1:15:26] there's no middle
[1:15:29] your brother Brandon brother Brandon
[1:15:31] said there's only two forces at work in
[1:15:33] your life two
[1:15:34] once of God ones of hell
[1:15:39] so if you're not live as a husband if
[1:15:41] you're not living up to what brother
[1:15:42] Branham said to be or there's the Bible
[1:15:45] said to be
[1:15:47] what did Jesus say what did what did
[1:15:50] Paul say
[1:15:51] love your wife as Christ loved the
[1:15:53] church
[1:15:55] the church is God's Queen
[1:15:57] it's a birth the bride
[1:16:01] you get married you go in your honeymoon
[1:16:04] are you gonna lay around tell your wife
[1:16:05] hey go cook me some eggs
[1:16:07] don't go sure go do this start start
[1:16:09] cleaning up
[1:16:11] not expressing no love not expressing
[1:16:14] anything what kind of honeymoon would
[1:16:15] that be
[1:16:17] wives
[1:16:20] are you the kind of wife
[1:16:24] that lines up with this message
[1:16:28] hey we're all friends and family
[1:16:32] are you the kind of wife
[1:16:34] that could say I I am that Proverbs 31
[1:16:38] Woman
[1:16:41] I am I am the way that Jesus said for
[1:16:44] the bride to address the groom It's A
[1:16:47] Love Affair
[1:16:49] It's A Love Affair
[1:16:53] can we say that
[1:16:55] if you're not
[1:16:57] if you're the wife and you says well he
[1:16:58] won't do this he you know he's cold on
[1:17:01] the Lord he's lukewarm
[1:17:02] okay
[1:17:04] you be the message to him
[1:17:07] husband you be the message to her
[1:17:13] you know I when I was studying this I
[1:17:16] got to think of the brother when brother
[1:17:17] Brandon told that story about that that
[1:17:19] drunk sinner
[1:17:21] that brought his friends home with him
[1:17:24] he's going to show him what a wife he
[1:17:26] had
[1:17:30] made her go in there and cook
[1:17:32] for him when they're cooking brought it
[1:17:34] to me like he threw it on the floor
[1:17:37] started yelling at her cussing at her
[1:17:40] she got down her hands and knees began
[1:17:42] to clean it up
[1:17:43] wanted to give him more
[1:17:46] she led them all to the Lord
[1:17:48] without opening her mouth
[1:17:55] never opened her mouth
[1:18:00] we always have something to say
[1:18:02] we want to be heard
[1:18:04] well my husband won't listen to me my
[1:18:06] wife won't listen to me
[1:18:08] show him the message
[1:18:11] leave the message in front of them
[1:18:13] that is the greatest
[1:18:15] thing on the face of the Earth you could
[1:18:18] do
[1:18:19] this counseling session is free it won't
[1:18:21] cost you a dime
[1:18:23] don't cost you a thing
[1:18:27] be the message
[1:18:30] that's what you were commissioned to do
[1:18:36] but Brandon said he was to pass that way
[1:18:41] brother random gets a little deep breath
[1:18:42] here I don't but he gets a little deep
[1:18:44] so you decipher it
[1:18:48] and so a good Praying Wife or mother can
[1:18:50] do more for the kingdom of God on her
[1:18:52] knees than sometimes the preacher can do
[1:18:54] on the platform
[1:18:57] that's deep in big words
[1:19:04] that's as plain as he'd be
[1:19:10] I don't like
[1:19:13] I don't like getting in people's lives
[1:19:17] because it's impossible for me to get in
[1:19:19] people's lives when I study and not get
[1:19:21] in my own
[1:19:28] be a perfect testimony of what God
[1:19:30] speaks through your life
[1:19:32] are we fathers this is me this is
[1:19:35] something that I got to looking at and I
[1:19:37] got a quote here that this really struck
[1:19:39] me
[1:19:41] you know
[1:19:44] we're to express the message
[1:19:46] to our children
[1:19:50] and some of you new fathers with new
[1:19:52] kids
[1:19:53] mothers even
[1:19:55] I want to look at the fathers here
[1:19:57] because
[1:19:58] you're the head of the home
[1:20:01] right
[1:20:02] you're the head of the home your wife's
[1:20:04] The Fifth Gospel
[1:20:07] but are we living the testimony
[1:20:11] one thing that always struck me was I
[1:20:12] would come in
[1:20:14] here at church and listen how
[1:20:17] things about the message and then I'd go
[1:20:19] out you know my son started getting in
[1:20:21] teenage years and and stuff and I
[1:20:24] thought and I got to thinking you know
[1:20:25] they're understanding things now
[1:20:27] and what they're hearing do they see
[1:20:29] that in me
[1:20:32] do they see the same message they hear
[1:20:34] on Wednesday
[1:20:35] let me tell you I fail so much as a
[1:20:37] death
[1:20:38] I failed
[1:20:40] many times
[1:20:43] I have sat
[1:20:46] just sat by myself many times at work
[1:20:48] driving down the road at home thinking
[1:20:50] of decisions I made actions I did
[1:20:53] with my kids sometimes
[1:20:56] thought why why did I do that
[1:21:00] why did I act that way
[1:21:08] then I got thinking God's a father too
[1:21:12] God's the father
[1:21:17] the greatest lesson
[1:21:19] that we could learn
[1:21:21] is how many times has he pulled us back
[1:21:23] in
[1:21:24] when we've made mistakes
[1:21:26] we've made failures
[1:21:28] as his kids
[1:21:30] and I thought Lord I want to be the kind
[1:21:32] of Dad
[1:21:35] now
[1:21:36] y'all know me and I've drove my kids
[1:21:38] crazy because they're my hobby
[1:21:40] I love them
[1:21:42] I do if they're doing something my first
[1:21:43] spit and I want to watch
[1:21:46] that's it
[1:21:48] a minister I have drove listen crazy I'm
[1:21:50] sure he's free now so
[1:21:53] for a little bit
[1:21:55] but they're my life
[1:21:59] they did things because I liked it more
[1:22:02] than they liked it
[1:22:04] showed their love for me
[1:22:11] that's the way God does
[1:22:13] God's love for you overlook
[1:22:16] the things in your life
[1:22:18] God lets you do things you want to do
[1:22:20] sometimes just because you want to do
[1:22:21] them
[1:22:23] just because he loves you
[1:22:29] but are we living the message as far as
[1:22:32] the message
[1:22:34] of this last Tahiti our kids seeing that
[1:22:39] or are your kids looking to somebody
[1:22:41] else
[1:22:44] are they looking for that message
[1:22:45] somewhere else
[1:22:48] they're going to get a message somewhere
[1:22:50] they're going to learn a message from
[1:22:52] somebody and let me tell you right now
[1:22:54] dads you better be involved in your
[1:22:55] kid's life
[1:22:57] you're in a society now that teaches
[1:22:59] them everything under the sun
[1:23:03] and you're a bad parent if you don't
[1:23:05] allow it according to them
[1:23:08] you better be this message right now in
[1:23:10] this age more than any other age
[1:23:13] you're in a society where it's all about
[1:23:15] me
[1:23:18] It's All About Me
[1:23:20] Society the people in today's society
[1:23:22] one and whatever anybody can give them
[1:23:26] they feel the government owns them owes
[1:23:28] them they feel the world owes them
[1:23:30] and they're going to take
[1:23:32] that's the message they're sending out
[1:23:34] that's the message the world's receiving
[1:23:36] and they're giving it
[1:23:39] hahaha
[1:23:42] sometimes we have to live out
[1:23:45] a page of the old book
[1:23:47] for God to open our eyes to see the
[1:23:49] chapter in the new book yeah
[1:23:52] yeah sometimes the old book brother Joel
[1:23:54] has to come at play in our life
[1:23:59] a mistake a fault of failure
[1:24:03] sometimes you got to be flat on your
[1:24:04] back so you can look up and God's
[1:24:06] holding this book right above you and
[1:24:07] says this is what you should have done
[1:24:08] the whole time
[1:24:11] what is your book reading
[1:24:14] which one are you reading the most
[1:24:23] but people today
[1:24:25] they want all the attention
[1:24:28] is no exception
[1:24:31] people in the in the message nowadays
[1:24:35] they want attention
[1:24:39] preachers
[1:24:40] they want to be in a certain big
[1:24:42] preacher big name preacher group
[1:24:45] I care less God didn't call me a big
[1:24:46] preacher group
[1:24:49] I'm a help all lowercase letters I help
[1:24:54] if I don't want to be any more than that
[1:24:57] I don't want to be no more than that
[1:25:01] there might be
[1:25:02] guys out here that think you know
[1:25:04] they're gonna get better recognition if
[1:25:05] they're with this group of preachers or
[1:25:07] this group of preachers
[1:25:11] guess what group I'm in
[1:25:13] biggest name preacher of all
[1:25:15] that's what group I'm in Christ
[1:25:18] that's the biggest name out there
[1:25:20] [Applause]
[1:25:27] but we want to give glory to men
[1:25:31] and and that's
[1:25:33] sometimes it's not the preacher's fault
[1:25:37] you get people
[1:25:38] you could tell when people are
[1:25:40] stuck on one preacher they'll follow him
[1:25:42] everywhere he goes if he goes on special
[1:25:43] meetings they go everywhere that's who
[1:25:46] that's the preacher they quote all the
[1:25:48] time they forgot how to spell brother
[1:25:50] Branham
[1:25:51] they quote that preacher all the time
[1:25:54] brother so-and-so said this brother so
[1:25:56] and so said that brother so and so said
[1:25:57] this what'd the Bible say
[1:26:05] God gives gifts he gives Talent
[1:26:09] to people and people want to steal the
[1:26:11] glory for it
[1:26:13] they want to steal the glory
[1:26:15] that's the message they're sending it's
[1:26:17] about me
[1:26:19] I did this I did that
[1:26:22] what did God do
[1:26:24] what message are you giving people
[1:26:27] that you did so and so you laid hands on
[1:26:29] so and so you sing this song you wrote
[1:26:32] this song and you want everybody to give
[1:26:33] you the glory who gave you the talent
[1:26:35] who gave you the gift
[1:26:37] that's the part we forget
[1:26:39] it's given of God what do you think
[1:26:41] happened to the children of Israel
[1:26:45] they gave glory to an image that they
[1:26:47] made
[1:26:49] they gave Glory God's glory
[1:26:53] and God destroyed them
[1:26:55] that spirit is still alive
[1:26:58] that's it's not changed
[1:27:01] brother Graham said at 59 when Jesus was
[1:27:03] here on Earth
[1:27:04] all things he did he gave God all the
[1:27:07] glory Jesus gave God all the glory
[1:27:12] all of it
[1:27:14] not 99 percent
[1:27:18] for God to use you he has to empty you
[1:27:21] of you
[1:27:25] he has to empty you
[1:27:27] you have to be a willing vessel so it's
[1:27:29] not you to start with
[1:27:32] it's not you to start with
[1:27:34] it's God using the vessel
[1:27:38] guys want to get glory for laying hands
[1:27:40] on somebody and praying for them they
[1:27:42] get healed of cancer
[1:27:44] I prayed for this person and they got
[1:27:46] healed I I I
[1:27:51] we it's all about God from from the very
[1:27:55] first scripture I read
[1:27:58] it's all about God
[1:27:59] this message that you were supposed to
[1:28:01] be the messenger of it's all about God
[1:28:06] Brandon said the mighty conqueror
[1:28:10] but you see it didn't last because if a
[1:28:12] man is to conqueror his objectives must
[1:28:14] be right and motives must be right
[1:28:16] what are your objective motives and
[1:28:17] objectives to bring glory to yourself
[1:28:21] to let everybody know who you are to let
[1:28:23] everybody know what you did
[1:28:25] is that your motive
[1:28:29] I'll read a little more
[1:28:32] and if you don't play the game fair
[1:28:33] you're bound to lose no matter how much
[1:28:35] conqueror you are
[1:28:37] you have to follow the rules of the game
[1:28:39] to be a winner if you cheat
[1:28:42] you're put out of the game
[1:28:44] no matter how good player you are
[1:28:47] so Hitler never followed the rules what
[1:28:49] an example
[1:28:51] he wanted all the power to himself he
[1:28:54] wanted all the glory to himself
[1:28:58] therefore his objective was wrong
[1:29:01] any man that has those motives and
[1:29:03] objectives
[1:29:05] I'm gonna go ahead and stop right there
[1:29:08] might not want me to read that last part
[1:29:12] we'll end up just like Hitler did
[1:29:17] it's quite an example
[1:29:22] you might say I am giving God the glory
[1:29:26] is your wife is your life expressing
[1:29:27] that
[1:29:28] is your life expressing I'm giving God
[1:29:31] the glory is your mouth expressing I'm
[1:29:34] giving God the glory
[1:29:38] can people look at you
[1:29:40] and see your humble spirit
[1:29:42] your Meek and contrite spirit
[1:29:45] are they seeing somebody that's boastful
[1:29:48] prideful
[1:29:50] boastful prideful
[1:29:53] it's all from hell
[1:29:55] you can turn it any way you want to your
[1:29:57] tear and pay you're bringing in Reading
[1:29:59] pages off your old book
[1:30:01] all glory goes to God
[1:30:04] brother Brian said how can I overcome
[1:30:06] remember your life will testify louder
[1:30:09] than your mouth
[1:30:12] what you live will prove to people more
[1:30:14] than what you say
[1:30:21] sometimes Satan's going to use
[1:30:23] somebody else's life to influence you
[1:30:28] Satan's going to use somebody else's
[1:30:30] message in their life to influence you
[1:30:33] you think well Joe how does that happen
[1:30:36] go ask somebody that still says they
[1:30:39] believe this message but don't come to
[1:30:40] church
[1:30:44] well because there's too many hypocrites
[1:30:47] there's too many Hypocrites you know why
[1:30:50] they say that they got nothing else
[1:30:52] they got nothing else
[1:30:55] so basically you're allowing Satan to
[1:30:58] use somebody's message
[1:31:01] and you're fulfilling it
[1:31:04] you're fulfilling it
[1:31:06] you're taking the message they're
[1:31:07] preaching to you because you're looking
[1:31:09] at their life
[1:31:11] oh lord they're claiming to be a
[1:31:13] Christian they're doing that they're
[1:31:14] doing this
[1:31:16] and they're preaching their life is
[1:31:18] preaching to you and you're accepting it
[1:31:22] you're accepting it
[1:31:24] you're fulfilling a page in their book
[1:31:27] that Satan wrote about them
[1:31:32] why don't you come to church
[1:31:34] and you influence them with the right
[1:31:36] message
[1:31:38] if they're being a hypocrite maybe God
[1:31:40] wants you to come in and you can preach
[1:31:42] your life to them
[1:31:47] let your life speak to them
[1:31:54] I'm going down here
[1:31:56] and it says close them to wind it down
[1:32:03] influence
[1:32:08] now you know there is somebody that you
[1:32:10] are influencing
[1:32:12] your life has a written epistle read of
[1:32:14] all man therefore if your life isn't
[1:32:15] according to your testimony
[1:32:17] or your testimony according to your life
[1:32:19] rather
[1:32:21] you are putting a stumbling block in
[1:32:23] somebody's way
[1:32:25] for somebody is watching you
[1:32:28] some little child is watching his mother
[1:32:31] watching his dad
[1:32:35] your life's going to be contagious one
[1:32:36] way or the other
[1:32:38] it's going to be contagious
[1:32:41] if your life is preaching this word
[1:32:44] this message
[1:32:46] if it's preaching the same message when
[1:32:48] you buy yourself as it is when you're in
[1:32:50] church
[1:32:51] you're going to be contagious
[1:32:55] but if your life is preaching something
[1:32:56] different
[1:32:58] you're still going to be contagious
[1:32:59] because people are watching you your
[1:33:01] kids are watching you
[1:33:03] they're watching how Mom and Daddy
[1:33:04] interact they're watching how dad treats
[1:33:07] mom and Mom treats dad
[1:33:13] there's got to be a life
[1:33:17] there has to be a life that speaks
[1:33:21] what is what is that life going to speak
[1:33:22] it's going to speak the name of Jesus
[1:33:24] Christ
[1:33:25] your life preaches Christ
[1:33:28] that's what the message is right that's
[1:33:30] what brother Branham pointed everyone to
[1:33:32] that's what his whole the Malachi 4 and
[1:33:34] 5 was to come to turn the hearts back
[1:33:36] right
[1:33:38] for what the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:33:41] the name above all names
[1:33:43] you know I was studying this
[1:33:45] I got to thinking of Mary in Elizabeth
[1:33:47] and I got to thinking how Mary
[1:33:55] Gabriel
[1:33:57] told Mary you're going to have a child
[1:34:00] you know how all that went then he tells
[1:34:01] her to go see Elizabeth
[1:34:06] the Bible says
[1:34:08] she gave salutations unto Elizabeth
[1:34:13] and took a prophet to come say what
[1:34:15] those salutations were
[1:34:18] he said that was the first time the name
[1:34:22] of Jesus Christ was spoke on human lips
[1:34:27] I'm going to have a son
[1:34:29] but Graham says she says are you married
[1:34:31] oh no no but he says it's not it's of
[1:34:34] God
[1:34:37] and Elizabeth catches that and calls her
[1:34:40] the mother of my Lord
[1:34:43] oh
[1:34:46] but the thing that got me the most
[1:34:49] was the name when she spoke it life
[1:34:52] coming to a dead baby
[1:34:54] life
[1:34:56] it was the message that Mary brought
[1:35:00] and wasn't me it wasn't the message Mary
[1:35:02] brought to Elizabeth wasn't about
[1:35:04] herself
[1:35:05] she wasn't telling her this is about me
[1:35:09] this is about Jesus
[1:35:12] that was the message she conveyed to
[1:35:15] Elizabeth and Life coming to that dead
[1:35:17] baby
[1:35:18] there had to be a life in there for life
[1:35:21] to come in there
[1:35:23] when you express your life to someone
[1:35:25] else
[1:35:28] for them to receive it they have to have
[1:35:30] that same life
[1:35:31] it may lay dormant for years
[1:35:34] anybody lay dormant for many years and
[1:35:37] that name was spoken to that seed that's
[1:35:39] in there
[1:35:40] they're predestinated
[1:35:42] ordained
[1:35:44] oh when when I think of predestination
[1:35:46] and how long a dormant seed can lay in
[1:35:49] there
[1:35:50] I always think of when brother Brandon
[1:35:52] went to the other side and that young
[1:35:53] woman came up to him
[1:35:55] woman comes up to him said brother Brown
[1:35:57] do you remember me
[1:35:59] he said no I don't said you baptized me
[1:36:02] led me to the Lord when I was 90 years
[1:36:03] old 90.
[1:36:07] she was predestinated to receive a
[1:36:10] message
[1:36:11] she was predestinated for to receive a
[1:36:14] message of the name that name was said
[1:36:16] he said she said you led me to Christ
[1:36:21] to Christ that was the message he gave
[1:36:23] her nine years old
[1:36:25] if that seed had never been in there
[1:36:29] if it had never been there it would have
[1:36:30] never received that message
[1:36:33] go listen deep call to the Deep I've
[1:36:35] said that here 100 times
[1:36:39] it's a free destination
[1:36:42] before you can receive
[1:36:44] brother brother when you come in the
[1:36:45] message it was something that spoke from
[1:36:47] here to something that was in there
[1:36:49] before the foundation of the world and
[1:36:50] when you took your first breath of life
[1:36:53] when you took your first breath of life
[1:36:56] God put it in there
[1:36:58] and said one day somebody's going to
[1:37:00] have an influence on that seed
[1:37:10] there's going to be a messenger come and
[1:37:13] that messenger might be Larry Elliott
[1:37:19] look brother Robin Larry tell you that
[1:37:21] story sometime
[1:37:25] it's a life
[1:37:27] and Strikes something if that's seed
[1:37:29] there's something you think there's
[1:37:30] something about that person
[1:37:32] something about him is speaking to me
[1:37:34] I've got to talk to him
[1:37:38] why it's kindred
[1:37:41] it's the same name in here that's in
[1:37:43] there and you didn't realize it was
[1:37:45] there
[1:37:47] were called to be Messengers
[1:37:53] why it had to be Shepherds the Holy
[1:37:55] Ghost the angel of the Lord appeared to
[1:37:57] Mary and told her she was going to have
[1:37:58] a baby
[1:37:59] knowing no man
[1:38:01] told her about Elizabeth's conditions
[1:38:03] she went up to the hills of Judea to
[1:38:04] tell Elizabeth
[1:38:06] and when she met Elizabeth she told her
[1:38:07] she was going to be a mother she
[1:38:10] couldn't understand it knowing no man
[1:38:12] but she said the Holy Spirit
[1:38:13] overshadowed me and this holy thing
[1:38:15] that'll be born of me will be called the
[1:38:17] son of God
[1:38:18] and I'll call his name Jesus
[1:38:21] and that the first time the name Jesus
[1:38:23] was ever spoken on a human lip a little
[1:38:26] dead baby in his mother's womb leaped
[1:38:28] for joy and shouted
[1:38:30] foreign
[1:38:33] actually said John received the Holy
[1:38:35] Ghost right then
[1:38:37] he received the Holy Ghost
[1:38:39] so if you ever answer your question if
[1:38:41] anybody could be born with the Holy
[1:38:42] Ghost
[1:38:45] and jumped in the womb of a mother and
[1:38:46] it never
[1:38:47] had received life yet the name of Jesus
[1:38:50] Christ spoke life unto a dead baby what
[1:38:52] it ought to do in a church that claims
[1:38:55] to be born again
[1:38:56] the name of Jesus
[1:38:59] just to name Jesus what it ought to do
[1:39:01] to a church that says I'm born again
[1:39:09] I got the honor
[1:39:11] several years ago and I'm not going to
[1:39:12] call their names they wouldn't want me
[1:39:14] to anyway
[1:39:18] I got the honor of baptizing a young
[1:39:20] sister in our church
[1:39:25] she'd been backsliffed
[1:39:37] her testimony was
[1:39:40] what her husband had
[1:39:42] she wanted
[1:39:44] she said I want one he's got
[1:39:47] he's not a breacher
[1:39:50] one of the most godliest men in this
[1:39:51] church
[1:39:53] got one of the sweetest
[1:39:55] spirits
[1:39:58] what she had
[1:40:03] for a moment God closed the Satan's book
[1:40:05] and said it's your time
[1:40:09] it's your time
[1:40:11] and what was in her husband's life
[1:40:15] spoke to her
[1:40:17] and said I want that what he's got
[1:40:22] I want what he's got
[1:40:25] that's how a message in our life is
[1:40:27] preached
[1:40:30] he didn't get up every morning and brown
[1:40:31] beater and say you better get saved
[1:40:34] he didn't say you're not seeing our kids
[1:40:36] so you get saved
[1:40:39] he lived
[1:40:42] he got up in the morning
[1:40:44] went to church went to work a Christian
[1:40:46] came home a Christian went to bed a
[1:40:48] Christian got up the next morning a
[1:40:50] Christian
[1:40:52] it's as simple as that don't complicate
[1:40:54] it it's as simple as that it's a life
[1:40:56] that's lived it's a life that you live
[1:40:59] that people can hear
[1:41:04] his life spoke the name of Jesus and
[1:41:07] there was a seed of life in her
[1:41:09] that responded
[1:41:13] that that might be the way it happened
[1:41:15] with many of us
[1:41:19] the name speaks to us
[1:41:21] the woman at the well Jesus said I am he
[1:41:24] that speaks to thee
[1:41:26] I am he
[1:41:28] she knew one was coming
[1:41:32] we've heard we've heard the ones come
[1:41:33] I'm he
[1:41:35] it touched her then what did she do she
[1:41:37] went and told the whole city
[1:41:40] the whole city turned out because of her
[1:41:42] testimony
[1:41:44] so your life might touch
[1:41:46] one person or many
[1:41:50] your host school maybe
[1:41:53] look how this nation was touched
[1:41:55] recently
[1:41:56] over an injury on the football field
[1:42:00] for the first time on ESPN you had a guy
[1:42:02] bowed his head and prayed and said God's
[1:42:04] name
[1:42:08] and nobody said anything about it
[1:42:12] there's power in that name
[1:42:15] I don't care whose lips it comes off of
[1:42:19] you say well they don't belong to the
[1:42:21] message there's power in that name amen
[1:42:28] let's Stand Together
[1:42:38] [Applause]
[1:42:47] sometimes we need to tell the devil
[1:42:50] you all heard people say I'm not talking
[1:42:52] to people I'm not wasting my breath on
[1:42:54] him
[1:42:57] well
[1:43:00] Jesus talked to him
[1:43:07] you know you you hear you know a lot of
[1:43:10] the times people get that because they
[1:43:12] say
[1:43:13] you know I don't uh
[1:43:15] you know you shouldn't confess things
[1:43:17] well I'm not talking about confessing
[1:43:20] you know if doctor tells you have cancer
[1:43:22] you say I'm not confessing that
[1:43:24] I totally agree don't say that don't say
[1:43:26] it out loud I got cancer
[1:43:29] you know if you don't want to say it
[1:43:31] don't say it
[1:43:33] but when God said you can be healed of
[1:43:35] cancer
[1:43:36] why don't you tell him that
[1:43:39] why don't you tell him
[1:43:42] you know Satan can put thoughts in your
[1:43:44] mind
[1:43:46] but he can't read your thoughts
[1:43:48] so brother Ram said you get a thought
[1:43:50] here don't speak it
[1:43:51] you can't read your thoughts
[1:43:53] but if you're thinking hey I'm going to
[1:43:55] be cancer hey God's going to save my kid
[1:43:58] God's going to save my son going to save
[1:43:59] my daughter he's going to deliver
[1:44:02] say it out loud
[1:44:03] let him hear it
[1:44:05] tell him about it speak that name to him
[1:44:08] Jesus said Greater Works than this shall
[1:44:11] you do
[1:44:12] let him know
[1:44:15] don't just keep it to yourself
[1:44:17] if you don't want to tell nobody else at
[1:44:19] least for for goodness sake tell the
[1:44:21] devil
[1:44:23] let him know what his end is let him
[1:44:25] know that you've beat cancer amen let
[1:44:28] him know that you've been saved let him
[1:44:29] know that you've been delivered
[1:44:30] delivered of spirits and whatever
[1:44:34] he's the one who gave them to you
[1:44:36] so let him know I'm not taking them
[1:44:41] you know brother Donnie she's referenced
[1:44:43] so many times about the box of
[1:44:44] rattlesnakes
[1:44:46] send it back
[1:44:48] providing a big note on top of there
[1:44:49] when you send it back

[1:45:32] it is
[1:45:37] let your life speak that name
[1:45:40] when you get up in the morning
[1:45:42] that'd be your number one goal
[1:45:45] don't be like me
[1:45:48] nobody talks to me in the morning
[1:45:51] because I don't talk to anybody in the
[1:45:52] morning
[1:45:54] I might say a few words to the devil
[1:45:57] but I don't talk to Austin Michael and
[1:45:58] Jennifer
