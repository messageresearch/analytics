almighty all-powerful omnipotent but it's wonderful to know him his father yeah revelation 22 verse 12 praise the Lord Oh Joe had a wonderful service trip Wednesday night a man thanked the Lord praise the Lord we're talking about our new home and actually looking at the reflection of the character of the God and the people of that new home versus the type of material that that new home is going to be built out of this new home consists of all different categories of people it consists of the elect and the Lambs book it will consist of those that are in the book of life whose names are non blot it out it will consist of those of revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come those that are athirst let them come and whosoever will let them come and take of the water of life freely so it shows us different categories of people that will be there a man I'm just glad I'm going to be one of them aren't you now notice as we've looked at this before that this book of Revelation is especially this 22nd chapter here it's a dialogue between the Lord Jesus the angel which is bringing the revelation John even the bride speaks up said to be very careful in reading it notice this this is Jesus now behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do His commandments that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter through the gates of the city I want to sure you notice that there in verse 14 it changed into another person which of course is John blessed are they that do His commandments it's not Jesus now speaking said blessed are they that do my Commandments of a blessed are they that do His commandments oh it's another person that's referencing him that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates into the city I mean let's be remember tune that before the Lord as we pray would you need to request in your heart to have only father as we bow our heads to the deaths of the earth and once we came we're so grateful Lord Jesus to be able have the opportunity to stand once again in the presence of the Almighty God so grateful father that we don't have to stand there before you with fiery eyes of judgment looking at us so grateful Father that we don't have to stand there with fear so gripping our humanity our sins our trespasses being there before us knowing that judgment awaits us how grateful we are that we can bow our heads close our eyes and call on father God Lord we are so blessed tonight if you never do one more thing if you never answer another prayer if you never heal us if you never meet another need or another burden in our life that we have just to make us your children we are so blessed we want you to know we appreciate it tonight with all of our hearts origins our pretty should speak to us tonight fathers we look into your word once again Lord in Jesus name and the Saint said God bless you may be seated before we go back into the tree of life I would like verse 2 first tonight look at life itself life itself life is a great thing as a matter of fact it is the greatest of God's gifts most people in their mind they would think about now what great things would be in life the carnal Laodicean they think more of things and what all things they can accumulate and what all things that they have in their possession and what all things they want in the future and they are jealous of other people because they have more things than they do money or whatever more that it is but in reality and all the things of life and the things that go with life that is not the greatest part of life itself now money of course we know that money is in exchange and we're able to exchange it for goods for different things of life and we need money of course to be able to live function operate but money itself is not the greatest thing of life human love is a great thing but yet human love is not the greatest thing of life actually the greatest gift itself would be life itself now let's look at it for just a few moments before we go back into the Garden of Eden now if this building here tonight was entirely stacked full of hundred dollar bills beginning at my office door every crack and cranny the baptistry included the furnace room we'll even put it in the organ we'll put it inside these amplifiers speakers in every room we can do it Wolf's tank hundred dollar bills plumb up to the ceiling we'll go all across the fellowship hall we'll put them there we'll put them up into the nurseries upstairs who put them into the bathrooms we'll fill the sink we fill under the sinks we'll put them in the vanities we'll put them in brother Jim's office chair in the library we'll have as many hundred-dollar bills as we can stack inside this building then we'll fill the fellowship hall and then we'll start on the outside and we'll go 25 feet out from the walls of the building itself and we'll make a total circumference as high as we can stack them then we'll fill everybody's vehicle car truck RV whatever you're driving tonight we'll fill them all with hundred-dollar bills as well now some of y'all's eyes as big as half dollars right now oh my goodness what I could do with all that but yet now if we had all of that and then we had every bit of this money that would totally be around us and here we were as humans and all of us were here of course we're not sitting here because there's money in your Pew but we're standing on the outside watching us all this money has unloaded and whenever the last stack of money has been unloaded and the final hundred dollar bill has been placed in the in the desk or in the office or in the car wherever it is and after it's all said and done and right when we are going to be allowed to get as much as we want we all die so I ask you which would be worse the most all that money or life praise the Lord now if all of that money and we know how it's been for centuries that man has loved gold I mean you give all the gold rushes that have been down through time and people have sold everything they have and they went to the Klondike rush they went to the San Francisco 49er Gold Rush they won all over the world and the majority of them lost everything they had many of them lost their lives they lost their family right they lost so much stuff just on a hope that they would become a rich millionaire whatever it was because of them of a medal that was gonna be dug out of the ground and many of them lost their life on the whole or a promise of someone who went into the gold fields and dug out and the majority of them never got one thing but yet they risk the greatest thing of all to get something that they had no vindicated promise that they would ever become rich or famous or important and they gave away the most important thing they had which was life now want you to think about that now no matter what we could talk about tonight or think about now let's move beyond money and let's think about pleasures because that's what Laodicea loves so much are the pleasures of life so whatever that would bring human beings pleasures now even we as children of God have things that we enjoy doing places that we enjoy going and all that but whatever that we could talk about tonight that would be pleasures and we would think whatever is the most pleasurable in life to Christians is things that are not sinful of course and then we weren't able to think about all the pleasures that we enjoy and all the things that bring us the deepest of happiness and things that are external from us that would be able to satisfy and be able to lift our spirits for a little bit and make us feel better and bring something to us that would being an element of human enjoyment and yet we could pile again all of that together in one pile and it could be all be given to us and we'd say go enjoy your life and spend years and years and years on vacation and get off of this boat and get onto that boat and when you leave that boat get on this airplane and go here and there and there and never have to work again the rest of their life will be a vacation and the very day you get ready to start it you die so what should be the greatest of value to you a Disney cruise or life now what I find amazing about this is that people then will listen to Satan who will talk them into smoking drinking doping or all kinds of other things that they do to themself which is proven to shorten and take away their life and yet they will exchange an element of years of smoking or an element of time but woods they're able to get drunk or high or so on and so on for the greatest gift of all which is life now if we would look at it in the temporary natural sense natural life itself it's a built-in mechanism within us I'll find that amazing because when God made us he made our brain when there was no danger on the earth God made our response time and our reaction time so whenever we see danger that were able by perception of the eyes and it's able to flash into that part of our brain and it reacts within three quarters of a second so somebody stops in front of you they tap their brake lights they turn in a turn signal they just made up their mind they're going to start with this vegetable stand and get some tomatoes and they might call a major accident fifteen people behind them about pileup but God made us even when there wasn't any cars when man did not have to respond that fast but God knew there would be cars so God made us with a built-in mechanism to where that within three-quarters of a second sunset that we're able to respond faster than you can snap your fingers so what is it it's something built in us to be able to protect our lives so you're behind the wheel you're driving all of a sudden BAM that sudden not quicker than what I just did that you're able to react according to that built-in mechanism well if it is that way just about someone turning off in front of you or someone go to hit you and you'd go up like this to protect your face how much more is it built in us naturally even naturally to protect ourselves against the plight and the contagion of sin it's in man as just a fallen son of God to rebel against sin itself and man has to override that same buried deepest in him to you to the sin of the enemy to take his own life so they can put it on the pack of cigarettes warning Surgeon General has determined that smoking your cigarettes can cause cancer well this can cause it that can cause a drinking alcohol and they'll good and spot of every warning you put up there and yet take vitamin C to help keep them getting a cold oh are you crazy yes you are you take vitamin C the up if you're going to not get a cold and sat down and drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes and smoke yourself to death you're out of your mind well come on happy Valley if a man's will be appreciated but yet there's something about life no life itself you know it's a great mystery but we know that God I think believes that God will ever allow science to ever to be able to break in it and create it now we know they try to clone and try to do all different kinds of things with DNA but still they did not make the DNA or the light by which the DNA come from only God can do that but yet they desire to break into life itself and be able to tell of course say they keep the bodies are you know different Communists leaders and they've got them frozen or whatever more under the partition that they think one day they'll be able to bring life back again because man wants to live forever without coming through the power and under the submission of the Cross right so he wants to be able to do through how a test tube or medication or some sort of shot he wants to be able to gain live now Satan will tell people oh this is the life this is living you're really living he knows he's lying to you he knows that he's telling you a lie trying to convince you the drinking alcohol and all these other things is alive why science itself will tell you that it's not oh you've got a news read the warning and know that it is not but Yeti convinces people that is alive in reality it's not so you take the rich the famous all my those great celebrities around the world and when they take their lives or they're in an automobile accident then what happens to all other money whenever these great wealthy important people have you ever seen any of them take a million dollars with them to hell you ever seen them pay a million dollars inside of the casket well they might put it in there but I guarantee it'll never make it to the Graveyard they'll be picked clean well is that right why are people saying why should you let all that go to waste I mean they're able even burning that with them I'll help myself to a little bit well the Undertaker gets a little bit the gravedigger gets a little bit more ain't so-and-so gets so-and-so uncle cousin get so-and-so so well in the world burn all that good money so which is the greatest money or life answer me which is the great alcohol our life which is the greatest the pleasures of sin or life now notice in it is on this aspect that the very kingdom of God is bill and that is the basis of life God is the controller God is the giver God is the creator of life perpetual life and eternal life and we know that he is the only source by which people and things can actually live and reproduce now based upon this and we know when we go looking into the paradise of God that we have several phrases by which God Himself coins and use them in the Tree of Life the crown of life the book of life so everything that goes before that is a synonym with that word comes from the great creator himself the rewards giving to the overcomers of the church ages as an affiliation with life so heaven itself it's not just about gold and silver and beautiful things but it's about life praise the Lord now in the Garden of Eden it was based upon that very thing I remember when God started with the lower forms of life you know the Prophet said it might have started with an amoeba a very form of short form of life might have come from a one-celled saying whether it was that God started it from and then it started expanding and the cells began to divide and he kept going higher and higher and higher and it was a form of evolution but spiritual evolution not 9 stirred the others as the scientists would look at it now we realize then that God himself is the one who gives life a none son himself the great brain who had such significance so there's only way to be able to look at the universe and things that's there and explain it and that is Hebrews 1 and that says that the God who framed all sayings by the power of his word right we still believe that dormant but we know that before God ever brought the man into existence that life had already come into existence for maybe millions of years we don't know for sure but even in the end itself when God began to expand the heavens and the angels began to take form that God made some that were of his essence some of his character and they actually spun off of his being so they were not time beings they were not created in the element of time but coming from the eternal they would not have a beginning if you could understand that you'll see where you were in your gene for that's why we have eternal life so it's not that that life actually started on one day but it's spun off of him which is eternal but also from him that part of himself he could allocate things that would come forth and fill in the span of time and then they would cease to exist because they are not part of him and that says you understand now the Lord of course knew exactly had to make all this and man searching for life on Mars and trying to figure out how to go out and live on Mars and we got millions of acres here on the earth were there any human beings that ever set foot never even lived or anything else I'm able to go out turn try to figure out how to live on Mars my goodness and all the problems and issues that we've got you on the other why don't we try to figure out how to plant more food make more water and all that stuff but it's always man trying to get after and fiddle around on something they don't even know what he's doing well praise the Lord that's man that always mind in somebody else's business and not take care of his own house once you fair how to take salt water and make drinking water out every time the desert into something to be able to bring forth roses and cabbage and peaches and apricots but that's man he wants to look at something like that because to him he's saying oh my and yes science itself is our life science cannot make a blade of grass science cannot oh you say they can they cannot they have to take an original life and be able to tamper with the seed line and be able to get inside of that they cannot make life itself why God is the one who made it so God will he be able to bring all of this into existence and then when he made the earth and put all the life the beginning of life they're probably meant for an angelic life into botany life animal life and whatever lower form of life that is started and he kept coming up higher and higher and higher until the Lord God made man now know of God we could know of course in Genesis 1 that God brought out of himself this man in Genesis 1 this was the man of course which was in the original image of the word and then the man at Genesis 2 took on the form of the kingdom he was going to be king over now the man in Genesis 1 could not a properly rule the kingdom by which he was going to be king over as long as he was in spirit form so God took him and give him a hand like a bear a foot like a monkey and all this and that in the other because he bore within his own earthly image parts of the kingdom by which he was gonna rule over so much the Son of God did the same thing and become a human being he could not die in the form of workers he could not die supernatural light he had the dies of man now whenever God brings it to this stage then of course the Lord wants to bring forth the first specie that would have this human life that's a higher life than that of the serpent of the chimpanzee of the monkey of the gorilla of all the other things that lived on the earth and God makes his human being out of the dust of the earth and he forms all of the organs the bones of sinew the sales of tissue whatever more that's there but the man stands as it wise with his toes like roots as a tree down into the Earth's a man cannot breathe a man cannot move he is no more than the mechanics of a bunch of calcium potash petroleum cosmic lights so God takes the mechanics of all of this and he reaches over here and gets a handful of this and a handful of that and he goes to shaping it not from the clay but from the dust of the earth the very top of the earth itself then God goes to making all of this but still there's no life so it's like a Potter as he takes a handful of clay and it begins to take on an image now there was no visible image in God's mind but which he can make it from except for the spirit image of the logos there was no other man there but yeah they begin to form him from that spiritual image I remember in the eternal he can look at something that is not and considered as though it is already there so the Son of God did not already have a flesh body but your atom is made in a pre figure of what the Son of God would look similar to thousands of years down the road everybody with me so here he stands but he is still non alive so now look around him he's got all this beautiful paradise the trees are alive the monkeys are alive elephants are alive all the Botany life is alive the flowers are blooming the waters trickling down it's such a beautiful paradise but your sons this man totally completely lifeless no he has ideas eyebrows eyelashes yes pupils his corneas he has fingernails toenails he has all these things so the mechanics of his body is there by representation but he's still not alive right now he has a position by which he is the head over all of this but there doesn't do him any good because he's not alive are you getting my point life is the same he had eyes but he couldn't see he had hands but he couldn't feel he had a mouse but he couldn't talk because he did not have any life people can come to church and clap their hands and play tapes and say they believe the message home I'll say I'm the pastor but without eternal life they're just a bunch of mechanics piled up in a pile but we don't want to be mechanics only we want to be dynamics and mechanics now the mechanics of course is the body of Genesis 2 and then the dynamics of supernatural part is that word comes from a Moya the breath of God which must be breathed in him but also atoms supernatural being which existed in Genesis 1 now this is before of course he's called Adam he was yet the word so he had not attained a human name so here he stands all mechanics total mechanics absolutely no life no movement no nothing else everything around him maybe the animals combined looked at him and the birds flew by and looked at him and all this life is moving around a bit himself as absolutely nothing the elephant could come by with his trunk and breeze on him he did not have the ability to impart this Numa of God this life this animation in this body could not do it there was only one source by which the life could come and that was from the eternal right how many else ever made mud mud houses and mud toys and your sisters when you was little make mud cakes and mud pies maybe some of your brothers made them I don't know but you played in the mat and you go to a beach and you make a wall they call it a sand castle well you ought to see some of mine they look like a wrecking balls out there because I'm certainly not an artist but yet you make all of that is there any life in it well you may place your doll in there your little girl you may place your horse in there you know if you're a little boy you might sit your John Deere tractor inside though that it's only it's only alive in your mind now you sit down before Papa Papa let's see that animation is only coming from you because there is no life in the tractor there's none in the Barbie doll there's not in the Sandcastle y'all preaching with me tonight there's absolutely nothing there but just the mechanics itself so you animate that and you say well come on dog come on honey you know this is your family so you are the animator of the life of this creation so you're putting there in your imagination well God did not want it to be imaginary life in this Adam the son of God God wanted them to have I realized I was an animation in the sense that God is going to breathes in him the breath of life so all this is around him but it doesn't do him any good because he's totally unaware so we could do the same way tonight a rich man roll up here and my we all passed by leaves a good old guy man he was a good old guy we could pile up all of his money we could put all these car keys and all of his truck keys and all of his guns and rifles and whatever it was he done it won't do him one bit of good not be able to take not one thing with him is that right so what's would he rather have his fine house his fine car if they could get one of the other back which one are you thinking to choose I know which one to choose he would choose life well this is what I'm trying to tell you tonight that God by the gospel offers us not just human life to be able to perpetuate and pass our genes down from one generation to another but God is offering to us eternal life which is not the life of our mother the life of our Father but it is his our life which is Zoe right which can never pass away though the body will die though it would go back to the dust of the earth yet once we have been breathed upon by the eternal Himself that life is ours forever now won't you notice something now that whenever the Lord told Adam that there's two trees in the Garden of Eden one of them was the Tree of Life and the other was the tree of knowledge of good and evil and God said don't protect that tree now the knowledge of good and evil on the day you eat thereof that day you shall now I want you to notice what God told him God did not tell him and the day you eat thereof that day you'll be lost and become a son of the devil God never told him you're going to hell the day you eat there now listen friends come on out we've changed this drastically the way it was in the Garden of Eden this one reads my folks under sent election they don't have election write in Genesis - I don't have it right in Genesis 3 God told Adam the consequence of what would happen if the aid of that tree what was that he would die he did not tell him he would be lost because Adam could not be lost any more than God could be lost God did not tell Adam he was going to go to hell because that was impossible well praise God boy that ought to make some y'all near to have a spell why Adam could not ever go to hell he was a son of God but what did he lose his fellowship and then the cycle of death began to move in the Adams body God never told him read your Bible god never told him you will go to hell and the day you made that offer you will be lost the day you do that you'll turn into a goat God told him you will die and even inside Adam did not die that day but the cycle of debt said its motion and Adams members is that right so now then we have who we see that not another law which is law of death comes into the cycle of life which god of course never intended for it to be there but he knew that it would now notice this in Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground now notice now this is the first revelation in this chapter you're the first revelation of the compound name of God that is being revealed in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God God I don't I you and well to him God created the heavens in the earth but here in Genesis 2 we have it is Jehovah with his family so it is Jehovah out of him or Jehovah I don't know so it is a compound redemptive name of God never remember the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of God so here we find that the name of God in Genesis 2 is revealed in another attribute praise God notice so the Lord God not God created the heavens and the earth but the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground I noticed the Bible of course condenses his truth Moses doesn't tell us how long it was that it took him to form the man nor does Moses tell us how long it was that the man stood there and that life estate but the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils of the Hebrew word there is nostrils or face breathed into his face the breath of life and man became not a living human being but a living soul now notice so then man becomes an English a new fish a living soul so the man now has more than just human life which will grant to him the ability to perpetuate and reproduce that human life the man actually by the breath of God becomes a soul alive soul now before that it was a soul the soul of Adam existed of course before this time but it was not a soul that was expressed to where it could choose right from wrong day and night darkness and light it could not choose it was in the attribute form of God but once breathed out of the very existence of God placed into a human body then the man now becomes in this dedicated position as being a living soul not just a living human being a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food The Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil now here we have the man that is place a living soul man which is placed in a live garden except each of those lives are a little bit different the life of the beetle is different than the life of the animal and the life of the animal is different than the life of the fruit on the tree and the life of the fruit on the tree is a little bit different from the life of the vine that goes up the tree but they all come from one source right so you take the life of a vine that grows up and then you're trying to be able to transpose or move that life over into a tree you can't do it it won't live and so God made each life or this specie according to I'll you wanted it to grow in the beginning now here the man is a living human being but he's more than that he is a living soul aren't you glad you're living souls and I now think of it at this time there were no humans on the earth with a dead soul now you see the scripture that Paul wrote years and years later talking about the woman that lives in sin and said that she is dead while she live us could not been said in the Garden of Eden because there was no live human beings with dead souls dead nature your honor Sonam said now I'm talking about dead in trespasses and sin so there was none of that but it was a living soul and a living human being was perpetual life and his use of course was constantly going on now then of course God brought the woman out of another fall had come that way now notice in act 2 the fallen Genesis chapter 3 verse 22 and the Lord God said Behold the man is become as one of us I know Trinitarian people like to take this scripture and try to prove this that there was more than one God there but you do not find the Bible in the English or the Hebrew saying he's such saying but God is actually speaking to the council in heaven he ain't speaking to no little boy and no Holy Ghost associate but he's talking to those beings which are the eternal attributes of the eternal there in heaven glory the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken now I know the law moves and the cycle of Adams members now he is alive but he starts feeling pain and he starts sweating and from the from the brow he starts getting outside and laboring and the productivity of the grant changes and now he's got a laborer and he's got to fight these mind battles of what he did how that he's brought all this upon the earth and the creation of God every day he gets up your nights and feeling aches and pains and before that time he felt absolutely nothing that happiness in the health and the goodness and mercy of God wow what a day what a time we're going back into is that right but now he goes to dealing with issues and he goes to feeling physical things and no doubt by the chain in order to really cover the scope of the Fallen human being he had all kinds of mind battles in his mind what will the consequence of what I've done what will it bring how long will this go well God let this go for a generation or two or three or how long will this go my Adam would have known there would have been billions and billions of people on the face of the earth all the sorrow and heartache and difficulty that he introduced to the world no doubt the man could not have taken it no doubt in his mind the battle that he must have fought and what he must have won through the sickness that he dealt was and the the difficulty of him and even and he noticed as he walked outside of the garden God I slammed the gate as it was behind him and put cherubims turning every way to protect the way back to the Tree of Life and Adam went out into the earth and he noticed the ours had now lost the brightness of the green and the hues of the Blues had been toned back and the water in lost an element of its brilliance in the side he noticed the Sun wasn't as bright I said was the day before never worried look everything seemed to be toned down the hues of the colors were not OMA they were noticed brilliant as they were before and even though he was still alive the day inside of him he did not feel as happy and as light and he just did not feel the same anymore oh my understand I understand don't you as we get up every day of our life and we look around and we see the darkness that surround us everywhere the sickness of pain the suffering the heartache the trouble all might seems that it takes away some of the brilliance of the blue and the skies in it it affects the green and the trees and the green in the grass but one day my brother sister the condition that absolutely affect us sharing life one day they'll all be taken away that will never be a sick person ever marched down those streets of cold they'll never be a baby born blind they'll never be a lame a halter crippled prize dog the Blues will be as brilliant as they were in the eternal the Pink's the yellows the greens all hallelujah the magnificence of our Father in the color spectrum that he created will be in a way that you and I can only dream about [Applause] notice in verse 24 so he drove out the man drove out the man God don't like to drive his people but we're so hard-headed so stubborn God don't want to drive you he wants to lead you but why do we do many times we forced God to drive us like dumb driven cattle instead of sheep well preach brother Donnie hey man brother Donnie I wanna see brother Donnie so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life to keep the way showing that life and salvation would never again be embraced by man until the Justice and the judgment of God was met and what man did inside the garden impose the just judgment of God and the pronouncement of death and man will never eat of that tree of life until the judgment of God has been satisfied Lord children if you only understood what I just said if the judgment of God has spice over your soul and you have eternal life tonight and you are already eating on the Tree of Life you ought to be one of the happiest people that is alive in the world today it means the judgment of God has been met concerning your soul and the Justice of God was mad in the Lord Jesus and God accepts you and allows you to protect of the Tree of Life what the cherubims kept Adam from The Hungry Ghost is leading you to what a flaming sword kept Adam from the Holy Ghost day bad day bad day is leading us to the Tree of Life not only are we feeding on it but the prophet of God said the Tree of Life is blooming in us praise be to God notice it's better bitumen their message called the end time he said now then Cain came and knelt down built an altar I'd imagined a notice says they come to the east side of the gate for therefore the angel stood with this flaming sword guarding the Tree of Life by the way he was guarding the people away from the Tree of Life now he's here trying to drive people back to the Tree of Life well I'm glad he finally got through my hard head and drove me back notice Jesus was our tree of life the woman was a tree of dead were the fruit of our mother she was the fruit tree we come here by woman come death by the woman come rise he said which also brought forth the man Christ Jesus right Satan used a woman to bring dead God used a woman to bring it back amen notice all born of natural sexual that person has to die but the man that's born of the Spirit of God never does notice in the fusion church they say him but overcometh well I give to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the paradise of God what a thrilling thought this is that Tree of Life and the Garden of Eden which could not be approached him to because of the fall of Adam is now given to the overcomer the flaming sword of the guarding cherubim has been ceased but it was not she eros blood whoa my blade was bloody with the blood of the Lamb let us meditate upon this truth awhile as we consider why that tree was denied to Adam and his descendants but now allowed again please don't misunderstand me if you've got the Holy Ghost and now you're already farther back than Adam ever started I want to get further back there where Adam was was he fell from it I believe we're set good to not see about the Holy Ghost and of the presence of God we'll never get away from the seal of God oh praise God I love this God's intention for his creation man is to express his words and Genesis animus given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed and you all want to know what you can do to be a Christian you want to know what you can do to be the Word of God live this word every day every day you live this word you are a written of hustle in this layout of same timeframe that we're in and you are expressing the world and that word will judge the people around you Oh mah alive will but the word will be the word expressed this is true is it not but get out of there but that word no because he will see live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there are rose Moses what a great mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word that prophet that type of the great prophet to come failed an anger to obey the word and there was also David the great king of Israel a man after God's own heart he failed by adultery when he was sent to well your name could be put in your as well filled life with me too and every prophet well we just go ahead and say it brother branham to by the venom failed brother Donnie's failed every one of us years fellows only one that didn't fail and that was Jesus mother Batam couldn't take the book Paul couldn't take the book only the lamb could take the book notices but eventually in the fullness of time there came on the head even Jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God this is why Jesus had to be tempted and try and test to this one thing to say oh yeah I can do it I can do it I can do it that's the only words but it's one more test that is one we prove our words so God had to learn to be tested by women Jesus was tempted by drinking Jesus was tempted in every part is we are yet without sin he had to prove what he was talking about did he prove it well praise God whose couldn't be honest he proved what I couldn't he proved what you could but since he proved it I don't have to prove it he's already proved it so I prove I believe him by the way that I live and that his life without of me that he proves his own words fill amen notice he says then was Satan foiled for you must one who live by it is written and that masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's word every word there wasn't one sentence that was not one diphthong there was not one letter that Jesus left undone that was not one commandment that he broke you hear me church that was not one promise in God's Word that he ever broke he kept God's Word he was without sin notice them when this manifested perfect one given to the cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life then that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the Word of God this is why people can't live right in this day this is why because I want to I want to I want to want to rain enough you've got to get the life of the tree in you Oh glory to God hallelujah oh ma notice this brother on Spencer I think of us read this quote over to Ruth Smeaton's this week and I just thought it was an outstanding quote I want to share it with you tonight I'd like to take a little trip and we'll go again we'll go up to the great Archangel Gabriel who is the messenger of the Covenant of the Jewish people who stands at the right hand of God one of the highest order of angels in the heaven and I would say to him Gabriel thou art a mighty angel you are loved of God you have been here for ions of time and you perhaps know everything in the heavens where everything is placed because you're one of God's right hand angels and you know the great secrets of the heavens you sounded the trumpet of the coming of the Lord Jesus you announce his first coming and you shall announce his second coming so you must be a mighty man or a mighty angel I wanna ask you on all of God's treasures what is the greatest thing you have found among God's treasures I can see Gabriel bring himself to attention and say the greatest thing I have found in God's treasure since he created me yes [Music] [Applause] God made me to live for eternal for eternity life it's the greatest thing there is it's amazing how many message people don't believe that I always find it so amazing whenever someone dies in a family a husband a wife a mother a father and all ma the people were crying lament and they just you feel so sorry for them because a lot of it's true crocodile tears you know that but a lot of it is real and it's genuine but they make no plans to spend eternity with that same person they're standing here crying over now and they'll cry and get depressed and have to get on uppers and downers and inners and outers to help them to deal with the death of that body and yet they make no preparation to live eternally was that individual which they say they love so much I'm sorry I just don't understand it and looks like to me if you really love them that much you'd want to go where they are well praise gone come on now Saints you would want to be where they are but it proves a lot of people do not they miss them in time and they miss what they know about an entire man that's as far as they go but to a real attribute of God life is a wonderful thing life is a blessing of God but not just human life not just the ability for us to perpetuate human life and pass our genes on and then pass it on down to another generation and another generation another generation all that will eventually die it will eventually come to an end oh ma and then we don't make hardly any preparation for eternal life people just get all stressed out of faith to go to church once a week oh wow the red skins will be playing about the time brother Donny's preaching wonder if I could stream it on my phone while he's preaching NASCAR will be going on at Bristol about the time he gets in the pool pig you better be worried about the other fire instead of NASCAR but people make so much preparation for their hole and then for the retirement and for what you know I want people to think well of me but what about life what about preparation for eternal I'm not sure I gotta think about it so I'm starving to death tonight okay I'm so thirsty I'm so thirsty I can hardly make it I think I can hardly go and here's this bottle of I'm thinking about it ah but whatever it's possible I don't know somebody didn't pause but Herron did you put something in this hello I know this did not come from a faulty fighter and there's all kinds of stuff injured I might kill me well there's one way to know but brother Donnie what if you're following a fox perfect well this for the sake of your argument what if I am what if brother branham was a hundred and seventy five percent long and a hundred and seventy five percent of his sermons show me where that's brought me to a disadvantage show me your welcome Stan show me where it has made me corrupt vile show me word has made me a child molester an adulterer a thief a liar show me where it is worked against me and a negative way in society you Liberty Stan show me where this made me avow Richard a wicked type of person but what if this message that we believe in priests is the truth you have lost everything if you stand against it come on Saints Obama Lagonda what if you lived this way what if there is no heaven you some of you hang on a minute you're not even going to understand what I'm going to say and some of your disagreements perfectly fine that you're right if there was no heaven if their laws no afterlife I'd still choose to be a Christian over being the center just for the benefits I have every day in my life as a child of God well now I know you're crazy yeah now you know for sure you heard me say it yourself if there was no heaven if there was no hell I'd still want to be a Christian because I've got joy that the world knows nothing about I've got peace that the world knows nothing about he heals me what I get sick he encourages me when I get down he helps me when I was somebody would place was neither neither I would live for him here no streets of gold Jimmie's us but I did all the Santo [Music] [Applause] and eternity [Applause] well it's so bad it's getting a hold on me ah that scares me it's getting hold of me you know what cuz you're a coward to let go I always feel sorry for folks to Kate let go they're afraid to totally trust God you're afraid it's very to totally trust any preacher they'll totally trust nobody and the one they can't trust the most is the one they're holding onto the most which is himself our trial Scots prophet much more than myself in a out of the way so I'm good should I do it shut up but can you guarantee me now some poison mother tongue are you sure now you sure what if there's one bottle out of that million to come I don't know can you imagine if that was eternal life it had been scientifically proven everybody that drunk this particular lot that come from Gatorade the gray hair fell out I wouldn't even get to get it cuz y'all be beating afar out of me trying to get their wrinkles left the pump in the Box gone I'm afraid you're crazy you're out of your mind now you

everybody's hitting the water fountain Lord Shiva I wish I could do that to you with eternal life I solar second fruits Jesus so real to you I wish I could preach Jesus so real in heaven so wonderful and so beautiful that nothing in this world would ever hold you back I want to be able to preach it not so much death and this and that on the other let me preach it so real that people can see the gates of pearl not me preachers are so wonderful that they can't stand until they meet [Applause] I was only acting and that's why people liked with eternal I hope I'm not sure okay oh that's too much I don't want to become a fanatic why not you're going to be somebody's food I'm a fool for Christ who's fool are you everybody in this building tonight of somebody's food [Applause] [Music] notices Gabriel says the greatest thing I found in God's treasures you imagine all the treasures birthmark that Gabriel has seen all of the things he's heard took off and Gabriel would say the greatest singer but brother Donny that's only brother branham's word for that as I said I'll take his word you think you can argue me out of it you're crazier now thought you was we only have one man's word that wrote Genesis but I'll take his word for when God made me to live for eternal for eternity life is the greatest sin camry as i said this afternoon this afternoon i wanted to speak on the greatest gift in the bible and how many in the audience this afternoon could think of any greater gift than God is given to man then eternal life there is not one gift that could be given greater than life I'm sick and tired of Holy Ghost feel Christians looking down on their eternal life as if it's second-rate compared to speaking in tongues or shouting or jumping or running all that's good and wonderful the greatest gift God can give you is not to see visions not to dream dreams not to prophesy not to speak in tongues the greatest gift God can give you is eternal life speaking in tongues is wonderful but we won't be done in heaven seeing visions is wonderful but we won't be done in heaven prophesy is wonderful but we won't be doing it in heaven but we will have this gift and heaven eternal life [Applause] there is not one gift that could be given greater than life life is that sublime sublime gift it's the greatest of all gifts for where there is alive oh my there is joy and God alone has eternal listen pardon me while I finish my eternal life oh praise God help refreshing hyper fresh thing it is and you got a hearing Laodicea you wore out and exhausted and tired dealing with the issues of life were able to come to church on Wednesday night or Saturday night or Sunday morning pray he's God and the Lord sets a big old refresh and dose of Holy Ghost eternal I thought in front of us we go to drink in it in praise God it revitalizes don't it oh yes it brings strength and brings health and encouragement thank God let me reach a few scriptures shed before we go some 1611 that will show me the path of life in that presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore Psalm 36 9 for with thee is the Fountain of Life in thy light shall we see light proverbs 6:23 for the commandment is a lamp under and lamp and the law is light and reproofs are instruction are the way of life father's 10 11 the mouse of a righteous man is a whale of life this st. Just's over the preacher this is what God wants everyone of you believers to be now if you're spilling out gossip and this and that and the other than your mouth ain't a well of life it's a trash mouth it's a garbage mouth well praise God but the mouse your match of what a miracle that is the mouse of a righteous man is a whale it ain't just a bottle of Gatorade it's a whale it is a whale of life but violence covers the mouths of the wicked proverbs 15 for a wholesome tongue is a tree of life so now we've got the well and we've got the tree back in the man again a wholesome tongue why how in the world could any of us have a wholesome tongue when a human turn you set on fire of hell tell what James said don't make some big up bug eyes at me do you realize what a miracle you are - not if you have a wholesome tongue now some folks have a whole lot of tongue but it ain't wholesome I don't want to hold on I want to hold someone well I'm gonna let you go if I get killed here a wholesome tongue it's a tree of life but perverse this therian is a breach in the spirit you're not 21 8 and into this people thou shalt say that saith the Lord behold I set before you the way of life and the way of death John 6:35 and jesus saith unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst look what he's open to us children the bread of life the tree of life the book of life the way of life the path of life the light of life right here at your disposal and Laodicea if you can imagine in your mind we're in the middle of this dark chaos all this filth debauchery violence murder everywhere around us all this don't you understand what all this is all this violence it's preceding the tribulation people are getting under the tribulation anointing it's a pre-tribulation anointing of murder and killing and violence and they watch all these video games and they watch all these movies and read all these stories and get on all these websites of all these violence come on brother Donny you can make all the gun laws you want to we need to start making some laws against Hollywood Hollywood's the one that's run in their minds and all this music come on Saints oh yeah that's free expression they called it yeah that's why the downfall of our nation Satan knew he knew our founding fathers by founding it they did not have a clue what it would lead to the defamation of our nation in the end time but they're able to do all these things and say all these things cop killers and this and that and the other and their songs come on they can say all that in their songs but it'll come to pass if a preacher stands up and preaches against homosexual marriage to be thrown in jail why because they've got every right but we don't have not well let me say it this way we don't have much and Laodicea but I've still got a right to preach the truth as far as God's concern one set for tolerance tolerance tolerance love and an amazing how that tolerance works for everybody but those who believe the truth [Applause] so China San Fran it's at anointing of the pre-tribulation it's getting upon the people why because the foolish virgin will be hunted down like dogs that killing murdering thing you've heard it this week but one of the big networks was introducing a new drug new television a movie thing and it was these leftists as hunting the conservative people called the hunt yeah so you got to lift just going out on hunts and they're hunting conservative people with rifles and there was so much kick back that they decided to pull it but you see the mindset is there the mindset is already there to get rid of people that have morals to get rid of people that still say male and female Pam and her come on church so she could cry on me if I come out in the middle of the street and there's a hole there I'm gonna call it a manhole I'm sorry if that offends you it ain't an air hole it's a manhole man power God was a man I'm a man and I know it I like wondering if I was a girl oh I wonder if I'm a woman I don't know who is I was a man praise the Lord God made me a man I want to remain a man oh lord have mercy thank God for the truth but what is it it's a lien tolerance of the tribulation period raise God and what I just said to you is classified as hate they can call us all kinds the name say all kinds of things the batter's ridiculed us make fun of us and nearly kill us but it's for expression well a man don't you love him with all your heart aren't you glad you have most of us never have to worry about the building being full of money even your Pew you ain't gonna worry about your pube in a bowl of money some of you ain't got your pocket full much there's anything else but aren't you glad you know what God's greatest of all gifts is but the jack we've got it eternal life eternal life we can never die now tell me your body now your body and God eternal not but your soul has eternal life let's bow our heads together thank you Lord Jesus Oh Heavenly Father thank you for your words tonight Lord we're reminded of the words Lord Jesus of your apostle that day whenever some of your disciples turned and walked away and followed after you no more and you turn to the twelve and said does this offend you you also want to leave and Peter said Lord to whom would we go you have the words of eternal life I find it so amazing that Peter had already recognized eternal life laid in the Rhema words of Jesus only praise God he had his faults but he sure had some understanding Lord we say the same thing tonight some people folks going this way some folks gone that way some ain't sure if I wanted to turn a life they kind of grab a hold of it and set it down and would not be poisoned well I didn't ban it might not be more what I can do I don't know some grab the hold of it well I'll change my mind but we still say what we started saying years ago you have the words to return alive where could we go so if we had all the gold of the world all the silver all the pearls all the diamonds there was all at our exposing yet we laid here and a coffin what could what he does if we owned a fleet a fleet of the greatest automobiles that were ever made but yet we were in a casket dead what good would it do so life is the greatest of HO gifts and I wonder how many of us Christians get up every day and don't even thank you when we live that day for another day of life we drop and complain because we had these problems and these headaches and but I wonder how many people in hell would rather be alive with all the problems of life than they went down there in the regions of the lost help us father no matter how hard it is may there not be a day go by that we do not give you thanks for another day of life how many sisters are tonight Lord or brothers who their companion has gone on or a child a father a mother what would they give for an hour a day what would they give for a week to be able to call that husband back just for him to put their arm back around their shoulders again and sit down and eat with them again what would they give probably everything they own because that would mean more than their possessions so lord help us while we have our husbands our wives our children our loved ones help us father instead of marginalizing on what we differ on help us to appreciate those that's in our families in our church family as I heard the song the other day Lord that we should love those that you put in our lives because one day you'll want them back help us to appreciate them Lord while you loaned them to us help Happy Valley to realize you loaned me to them and help me to realize you loaned them to me help me to realize large you loaned my wife to me my children my grandchildren my brother my sister-in-law my church family my friends but one day you'll want them back help me to love them help me to let them know help us Lord to appreciate our life while we have it so when those loved ones are called back home we won't have to spend the rest of our life with major regret well I wish I hadn't said that I wish I had done that really it didn't matter no true help us to realize a lot of the stupid stuff that we argue and fuss about in reality doesn't matter anyway help us Lord I thank you from our human life but I thank you most of all from my eternal life there's one here tonight father has not yet been birthed into it by the breath of God may they find it Lord granted I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus praise be to God praise be to God nobody ever loved me like you Jesus as Harry's been singing the song to us Lord and the story of our life could have been a different story oh ma could have been said about Donny Reagan that he was a bar owner down in Elizabethton or Johnson City some guy came in on Saturday night and pulled out a 357 and blowed his brains out I'm gonna have his funeral on Monday Donny Reagan local bartender those people that I serve the alcohol to and whatever more might come out and so I really liked him I really liked that was so unfair that's so unfair maybe I would have been some rich man some business man and never gave my heart to you maybe a lot of wealth see renowned people would come to my funeral and say wow man I really like that guy he was a nice guy but my soul was in the regions was lost Lauren Jesus thank you thank you that you've helped us did not embrace eternal life as a poison and spend decades of our life trying to decide whether we want it or not I'm so glad Lord Jesus as a child you helped me to pull that bottle to my lips praise God and when the lid was open I swallowed down Jesus Christ the very life of the Lord Jesus well I had much to learn much to understand much to grow yes I did and I'm still doing that Lord but I thank you that start when I was just a kid praise God thank you Lord Jesus so if I do have a funeral one day my habitat my piece of the paper won't be local bartender my piece in the paper won't be local gang member local mafia hitman praise God but those that attend my funeral will be saints and preachers why because that's who I hung out with in time that's who I'm gonna hang out with in eternity praise God oh Jesus we love you tonight thank you for becoming flesh Lord so the life of that tree could become a human being praise God thank you Lord Jesus nobody loved me like you love me Jesus praise God Kember just worshipping together a little bit can we just take a little bit time oh it's early yet and don't you appreciate eternal I thank God for my natural human life oh my you're saying force again Harry I know we've been singing this song a lot but it has just really been ministering to me I trust it's a blessing to you as well nobody loves me like you love me Jesus [Music] it's like a picture that you painted for [Music] [Music] thank you Jesus thank you too so I could you came to restore eternities

anything good in church all praise God amen thank you Lord Jesus Alleluia before we go I'd like for us to pray so that many of you know brother Mina get some dinner has been really sick and been in
