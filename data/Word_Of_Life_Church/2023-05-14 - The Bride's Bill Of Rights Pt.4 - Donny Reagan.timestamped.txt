[26:55] whether it's been sickness disease
[26:57] oppression sadness whatever it is one
[27:01] day they will bow at the name of Jesus
[27:05] I love to remind the devil of the
[27:07] scripture in the book of Isaiah
[27:10] they shall narrowly look upon thee and
[27:14] consider these saying is this the man
[27:19] to make the Nations to tremble
[27:22] he wants to be a God but God reminds him
[27:25] who he is
[27:27] God says also in the Book of Ezekiel he
[27:30] would lay him before Kings
[27:32] who were those kings be those who have
[27:35] met him in battle
[27:36] by the grace of God we have overcoming
[27:41] that's awesome and praise the Lord
[27:43] certainly welcome today in the house of
[27:45] the Lords of the presence of the Lord
[27:47] wish to extend to all of our mothers a
[27:50] happy Mother's Day
[27:52] thank you for your call I know that
[27:55] being a mother I'm sure sometimes you
[27:57] feel so unappreciated appreciated by
[28:00] your family and maybe even your husband
[28:02] and your kids
[28:04] every load of laundry you've ever done
[28:06] every egg you've ever burnt every piece
[28:09] of toast that you've burnt while
[28:10] learning how to cook and
[28:12] all the beds that you've made and all
[28:14] the things that you've done thank your
[28:16] sisters
[28:17] thank you so much
[28:30] we was very poor when we were raised and
[28:33] I can remember more than once my mama
[28:38] trying to stretch our food and make it
[28:41] go far enough I'm the oldest of seven as
[28:43] you know
[28:45] um I can remember her cooking and fixing
[28:48] and preparing the meals and then
[28:50] whenever it come time to eat it
[28:53] she said she wasn't hungry
[28:57] well now I'll look back and I realize
[28:59] she probably was
[29:04] but her love
[29:06] for us kids was greater than our hunger
[29:09] I thank God for a Godly mother
[29:12] thank God from others amen
[29:15] aren't you glad you have a mother
[29:17] aren't you glad she didn't want to
[29:19] terminate your life
[29:21] amen
[29:23] let me now get started on that today
[29:25] God bless you we love you so much let us
[29:28] read
[29:30] a few places you're in the scripture
[29:31] this morning will begin in Matthew
[29:33] chapter 18. we've read this last Sunday
[29:36] if you don't mind we'll read it again
[29:37] today
[29:39] I believe we're living in a great time
[29:42] to be a Christian to be Sons and
[29:45] Daughters of God
[29:46] and the Very onslaught of hell against
[29:50] us as the people of God and our nation
[29:53] and the world as far as that goes lets
[29:56] us know where we are in time
[29:58] and we can certainly see that we're in a
[30:01] great A great battle
[30:03] not only for our lives and for our
[30:05] health but for our nation
[30:07] and we know that she's across the line
[30:09] between mercy and judgment
[30:11] and we're so thankful though that God is
[30:13] still dealing with individuals one here
[30:15] and there and there and them wanting to
[30:18] give their heart to him let's read
[30:20] together Matthew 18 18. now remember
[30:22] these are not the words of a mere man
[30:25] these are not the words of the
[30:27] Theologian the doctor a teacher but the
[30:30] words of God himself incarnate
[30:34] barely I say unto you
[30:37] whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall
[30:39] be bound in heaven
[30:41] and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth
[30:44] shall be loosed in heaven
[30:46] again I say unto you
[30:49] that if two of you
[30:51] shall agree on Earth as touching
[30:53] anything
[30:55] they shall ask
[30:57] it shall be done for them of my father
[31:01] which is in heaven James chapter 5 verse
[31:05] 16.
[31:07] confess your faults one to another
[31:10] and pray one for another that you may be
[31:13] healed
[31:14] the effectual
[31:16] fervent prayer
[31:18] of a righteous man
[31:20] Avail us much
[31:22] First John 3 21.
[31:26] beloved if our heart condemn us not
[31:29] then we have confidence toward God which
[31:33] is so important when we're praying and
[31:34] asking God about things that we don't
[31:37] feel condemned in our heart
[31:40] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[31:45] because we keep his Commandments and do
[31:50] those things that are pleasing in his
[31:53] sight you see friends that's not complex
[31:56] it's not deep it's not real hard to
[31:59] understand it's very very simple if we
[32:02] just believe it notice the way John says
[32:04] this in the latter part of verse 22
[32:06] because we keep his Commandments and we
[32:09] do those things that are pleasing in his
[32:13] sight how many wants that today with all
[32:15] your heart before the Lord
[32:16] let's pray together if you would
[32:20] heavenly father as we bow our heads to
[32:22] the dust of the Earth from once we were
[32:25] taken and know one day
[32:27] unless we're caught up in the Rapture
[32:28] our bodies will go back the same way
[32:31] what we're grateful in this short
[32:33] journey in this span of time that we've
[32:35] been given called life
[32:37] we also have the opportunity to be able
[32:40] to live for you and do things for you
[32:42] and your people in your kingdom which
[32:45] will allow us to enter into life
[32:49] eternal
[32:50] and father I pray if there's one here
[32:52] today who doesn't know you in that way
[32:53] that you would help them that they might
[32:55] be able to
[32:56] embrace the person of eternal life dear
[33:00] God we're asking for every need those
[33:03] that are sick and Afflicted and weary
[33:05] we're praying that should help them
[33:07] fathers would stop by to pick up Erica's
[33:10] girls to come to church today and
[33:12] Heritage is so weak father we're asking
[33:15] you in the name of Jesus that you touch
[33:18] our Lord
[33:19] Lance had to carry her from the bathroom
[33:20] Lord and lay her in the bed but we
[33:24] rebuke the devil in the name of Jesus
[33:26] Christ may you touch her body now father
[33:29] not only her but everyone that has needs
[33:32] today
[33:33] father we commit it to you in the name
[33:36] of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the
[33:39] Saints said God bless you you may be
[33:42] seated
[33:44] I've been speaking to you for a few
[33:46] services on the bride's Bill of Rights
[33:51] taking it from the founding of our
[33:53] nation
[33:55] I don't know how familiar you are with a
[33:57] lot of the governments of the world
[34:00] but our nation is very unique
[34:02] in that it's established for the people
[34:05] and by the people I've been in lots of
[34:08] different countries of the world in
[34:10] which they claim to be Democratic and
[34:13] they claim to have a democracy but yet
[34:17] what's amazing is the same man runs for
[34:19] president for about 40 years and gets
[34:21] puts in every time
[34:23] so that don't sound like too much
[34:24] democracy to me and yet of all the
[34:27] nations that are on the earth those that
[34:30] actually have a declared Bill of Rights
[34:33] it's very few and the law to be able to
[34:36] stand on their side of course the Bill
[34:38] of Rights not only declares the rights
[34:40] of the individuals that make up that
[34:43] Nation but it also sets limitations and
[34:46] statutes by which the presiding body of
[34:50] government can be able to prosecute or
[34:53] press against the citizens of that
[34:55] Nation so rights are for the individuals
[34:59] that the rights have been given to but
[35:01] it also limits the prosecution and the
[35:04] persecution of the government of the
[35:07] nation that they are living in we can
[35:10] see little by little that our nation
[35:12] slowly is losing those rights I figure
[35:15] before we get ready to leave this place
[35:17] we'll lose even more but the bride's
[35:20] rights are just as equally important and
[35:24] it's if we do have rights that that are
[35:26] declared to us then it's to help us to
[35:29] see what's ours and it means that
[35:32] there's going to be an opposing Force
[35:35] that's going to try to press against the
[35:38] boundary of what those rights are going
[35:40] to say so in other words if you have a
[35:43] right to Healing you have a right to
[35:45] peace you have a right to eternal life a
[35:47] right to Salvation a right to this a
[35:50] right to that then there's going to be a
[35:52] force that is going to press against you
[35:55] to keep you from getting that you
[35:58] understand that now I realize that
[36:00] myself and probably most of you
[36:02] understand very little about the Unseen
[36:06] World that we confront every day it's
[36:09] hard for us to imagine that in the
[36:12] beginning there would have been myriads
[36:14] as the word of angels that were created
[36:18] and put on a stage of may I say
[36:20] probation so they were placed on a a
[36:24] position and they were given what the
[36:26] Bible calls an estate so they were given
[36:29] an estate now we think of an estate
[36:31] natural property we think of whatever
[36:34] your idea of an estate is whenever I
[36:36] think of an estate there's a particular
[36:38] a place that I think about it's in it's
[36:41] in Lexington Kentucky on the east side
[36:44] on a place called Versailles Road so
[36:47] it's the road that comes out of
[36:48] Lexington and goes toward Versailles
[36:51] Kentucky very beautiful place lots of
[36:54] horse farms on that place there and
[36:57] there was a young or an elder man rather
[36:59] that married this young woman and her
[37:03] desire was she wanted to be a modern day
[37:06] princess and she wanted to marry a man
[37:09] that would be able to give her a castle
[37:12] well this rich man was pretty much
[37:14] unlimited and his money so he buys this
[37:18] beautiful farm right outside of
[37:20] Lexington here on the Versailles Road
[37:22] I've been by there many times used to
[37:24] preach out in that direction and he
[37:26] fills her a modern day Castle now it's
[37:29] made out of stone similar to the one
[37:31] that Mr grindstaff built down here on
[37:33] the lake except it's much bigger much
[37:36] larger she wanted to moat around this
[37:39] property she wanted a gate there she
[37:41] wanted all different types of things so
[37:44] whatever her desire was was what this
[37:47] man wanted to do so he goes in there and
[37:50] he purchased this and he don't put it
[37:52] down in a valley doesn't put it in an
[37:54] obscure place but he purchases hundreds
[37:57] and hundreds of acres and he picks this
[37:59] ideal spot so everybody coming to word
[38:02] Versailles or from Versailles whichever
[38:05] direction you're going everybody coming
[38:07] through there including those flying
[38:10] over going into the airport or going to
[38:12] see this place because he wants them to
[38:16] know how much he loved this woman so he
[38:20] builds this absolutely breathtaking
[38:22] beautiful place but you know what he
[38:25] didn't want everybody and their brother
[38:27] coming in there taking pictures Trace
[38:30] been around all over the Landscaping
[38:32] barking marching all the way up and down
[38:35] the driveway so he put it a gated thing
[38:38] on the outside and actually got guards
[38:40] the last time I was there a couple years
[38:42] ago and actually had guards on the
[38:45] outside so if you come up with your
[38:47] camera and your video and you want to
[38:49] pay put a picture of you there in front
[38:52] of that place on Facebook them old boys
[38:54] is going to kindly or maybe not so
[38:57] kindly ask you to leave because this man
[39:00] designated this to be built for this
[39:03] woman that he loved so with that is the
[39:07] right of ownership is that is the right
[39:11] of possession is that is the right soul
[39:14] when I think of an estate I'm from
[39:17] Kentucky of course you know I love the
[39:19] road also going to Richmond and the road
[39:22] going to some of the different places
[39:24] out there and those of you that have
[39:25] been State 75 north where it breaks away
[39:28] from 275 and you go around the Kentucky
[39:30] Horse Park and you see all those
[39:33] beautiful fences there one of my
[39:35] brother-in-laws used to work there at
[39:37] the Red Mile trap and used to work at
[39:39] some of the horse barns and he's told me
[39:42] and caroly's sister that some of those
[39:44] horses live in nicer houses and a lot of
[39:46] people do so I think of the mistake of
[39:49] the Rolling fields in the blue grass and
[39:52] but demons did not have such a place but
[39:57] demons had a domain by which they were
[40:01] in a probation of partaking if you
[40:03] understand me in a realm of deity
[40:07] they had given to them an allocated
[40:10] allotment by which God would trust them
[40:14] with certain things now I'll be the
[40:16] first to admit I don't know what they
[40:18] did I don't know what they've done it
[40:21] seems as if though by reading in the
[40:24] scriptures that the Earth has had
[40:27] several different stages by which God
[40:30] has used her and we know according to
[40:33] the Book of Genesis that the Bible says
[40:36] these are the generations of the heavens
[40:40] and the Earth so it would lead us to
[40:44] believe that the heavens has had
[40:47] Generations not just one and that the
[40:50] Earth has been in many forms of genos or
[40:54] Generations so it's hard for us to
[40:57] imagine how many times that the Earth
[40:59] has been used by God and we can see
[41:03] reading from Genesis of course in the
[41:06] beginning God created the heavens and
[41:08] the Earth and the Earth was without form
[41:10] and void in darkness covered the face of
[41:12] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[41:14] upon the waters and God said let there
[41:16] be light and there was light but yet we
[41:19] contrast that with the book of Isaiah
[41:22] and we see that the way Isaiah declared
[41:25] the creation of the earth he does not
[41:27] mention the void or the darkness so it's
[41:30] as if though that Moses actually picks
[41:33] up the stage of the earth after a
[41:36] cataclysmic change has happened on the
[41:39] earth so Moses of course in Genesis 1 1
[41:42] in the beginning God created the heavens
[41:45] and the Earth and then he ends that
[41:47] sentence and then he picks up again but
[41:50] it doesn't necessarily mean that they
[41:53] are held in chronological order even
[41:56] though you'll go from verse 1 to verse 2
[41:58] it might have been thousands of years or
[42:01] Millennia by which that verse 2 and
[42:04] verse 2 was apart but it sounds as if so
[42:07] from Jeremiah and from Isaiah that Satan
[42:11] was allowed to walk upon this place
[42:14] which was created and the prophet tells
[42:17] us and that day on Calvary 1960 that
[42:20] whenever Satan walked upon the Earth and
[42:23] she was belching out volcanic ash and
[42:26] the all that was coming out of the
[42:28] bowels of the earth that Satan walked up
[42:30] and down on the earth and he began to
[42:33] claim it as his own and he said this is
[42:37] mine this is what I want now this would
[42:40] of course been before Adam was ever here
[42:43] and what the scholars call a preadamite
[42:47] world so it was an existence of the
[42:51] stage of the earth and it was before man
[42:54] before animals but it was allotted to
[42:58] created beings that were Angels now
[43:01] remember all angels are not created in
[43:05] the element of time but there are some
[43:07] angels that are created and they are put
[43:10] on this probationary period they are
[43:14] given an estate that God would allow
[43:17] them a certain partaking of his own
[43:20] divine nature but it was not something
[43:23] that was inherent to them that they had
[43:27] it because God had trusted them with
[43:30] said by virtue of its nature but it was
[43:34] like the word power and we have two
[43:37] words in the New Testament that is used
[43:39] for the word power one of them is
[43:41] exclusia and the other is dunamis and
[43:45] excusia is a right or a jurisdiction
[43:48] that is given to someone by someone
[43:51] greater so it doesn't mean that they
[43:55] actually have it by their own authority
[43:57] but dunamis is the power of the word
[44:00] that we get the word Dynamite from but
[44:03] it is something a power that comes
[44:05] within you and gives you that power by
[44:10] an inherent nature now a policeman can
[44:13] have all types of authority he can turn
[44:16] on that blue light he can write you a
[44:18] ticket if he's in a bad mood well he can
[44:21] make your day miserable if he has power
[44:24] apart from character but what does he
[44:27] have now if he's a State Trooper then he
[44:29] has to go through the state of Tennessee
[44:31] and they give him authority to do this
[44:34] and that and the other what does he have
[44:36] excuse him he has an authority given to
[44:40] him by the state of Tennessee that don't
[44:43] mean he has one ounce of character
[44:46] but dunamis is something altogether
[44:49] different it is a power that's given to
[44:52] you and it works with your adoption or
[44:56] your placing in Christ Jesus so it's
[44:59] something that comes in you by the new
[45:01] birth and inherit nature and then as you
[45:04] learn to submit to God and the more God
[45:07] can trust you the more God will allow
[45:09] this power to be able to pour out of you
[45:12] to others when God knows that he can
[45:15] trust you as long as you stay humble and
[45:17] small in your own eyes then God will
[45:20] just keep leading you leading you
[45:21] leading you until you reach the
[45:23] crescendo of your life and then God will
[45:26] Crown you with glory and take you off
[45:28] the Earth but many people will have
[45:30] excuses but will never have dunamis so
[45:34] God knew that there would be an element
[45:36] of these angels you said why would God
[45:38] ever do that well remember God had
[45:40] created this other being and God called
[45:43] him Daystar or he called him Lucifer he
[45:47] has many names as we know him of and God
[45:50] said thou was perfect from the day that
[45:52] I created thee until iniquity was found
[45:56] indeed he said did not I place thee
[46:00] ogarding cherub was it not I that gave
[46:04] you your position you was in the garden
[46:06] of God every precious stone was thy
[46:09] covering the Sardis the topaz which is
[46:13] many of the jewels that the city of God
[46:16] will be built out of yet he said
[46:18] iniquity was found in thee because from
[46:22] thine heart you said I will be like the
[46:26] most high that's When sin actually began
[46:29] now God knew that Satan would actually
[46:33] become he would come from the stage of
[46:35] being Lucifer to becoming Satan he also
[46:39] knew that Satan could not create Angels
[46:42] so God placed a number of these angels
[46:45] Mary edge of them on this probationary
[46:49] period and God would share with them
[46:51] this element of his power this element
[46:54] of adaptable deity by which they would
[46:58] be able to enter into but also leave
[47:00] from I don't want that myself people say
[47:04] well I want what Adam what had I don't I
[47:07] want something greater than what Adam
[47:08] had because whatever Adam had Adam
[47:12] walked away from it what I want I don't
[47:15] know about you but what I want in my
[47:16] soul is something that I'll never leave
[47:19] and something that I'll never get away
[47:22] from you follow me now so these angels
[47:25] then whenever they begin to hear Satan's
[47:28] message now remember the first preacher
[47:30] that we have record of in the scripture
[47:32] was the devil
[47:34] all right yeah he began to preach to
[47:38] these angels so he pulled these angels
[47:41] over onto the north side now remember
[47:43] the north side is the most spiritual
[47:46] aspect of Heaven it is the word that is
[47:49] used for flank it is the word that when
[47:51] they built the Tabernacle of testimony
[47:54] of witness and in the wilderness and
[47:56] they had the wrapping that would go
[47:57] around the outside and they they built
[48:00] it on purpose whether it would be bigger
[48:02] and they would have it where it would
[48:04] wrap around on that word there was the
[48:07] flank so it was the wrapping of the
[48:09] glory of God that would come around the
[48:12] north side of the Tabernacle Satan set
[48:14] his heart on the North you ever notice
[48:17] how a lot of major cities of the Earth
[48:19] the north side will be the one that will
[48:21] have the most Finance the most
[48:23] economical it's it's phenomenal when you
[48:25] go to looking at it so Satan said that
[48:28] it was the Norse he wanted the north but
[48:30] God told him what he was going to give
[48:32] he wants the North and he's going to get
[48:34] the sides of the pit so I don't guess it
[48:37] makes no difference of the sides is
[48:38] north south east to west yeah it's going
[48:40] to get burned up anyway
[48:42] so God knew that all this would happen
[48:45] now for us it's hard to imagine how that
[48:47] angels that never curse they never lied
[48:49] they never done anything wrong but they
[48:52] began to hear this master preacher and
[48:56] this master preacher began to set forth
[48:58] you know his message of rebellion
[49:00] against the headship of God and these
[49:03] angels which have not born in sin and
[49:06] they begin to amen as we would say and
[49:10] then they begin to vote with their feet
[49:15] you realize that's what people do many
[49:17] times they vote with their feet when
[49:20] people leave the word they don't
[49:22] necessarily say all right we're having a
[49:24] vote this morning who wants to leave the
[49:26] word everybody raise your hand no a lot
[49:28] of times they don't raise their hand but
[49:30] they vote with her feet they leave the
[49:34] word so they voted with her feet so the
[49:37] Angels actually voted with their feet to
[49:40] rebel against God now once they did that
[49:43] God did not strip them of their position
[49:47] and even the order of the Divine
[49:49] protocol we can see this of course in
[49:51] the Book of Daniel when Daniel begins to
[49:54] pray and you know the story that the
[49:56] angel come and he comes and tells him
[49:58] your prayer was heard from the first day
[49:59] and you imagine Daniel saying well why
[50:01] in the world will take you so long to
[50:02] get here then but we realize and get a
[50:05] view into what was going on that the
[50:07] demon over that City where Daniel lived
[50:10] God had sent an angel from the presence
[50:13] of God but but it just so happened the
[50:16] angel that he sent ranked less an
[50:20] authority than the demon who is in
[50:22] charge of that City so he wrestled and
[50:26] wrestled until of course the Great
[50:28] Mighty Archangel was sent to be able to
[50:31] rescue him and want him and the
[50:34] Archangel begin to wrestle then this
[50:36] angel came on down and brought the
[50:39] message to Daniel now whenever he tells
[50:42] Daniel the message and he delivers it
[50:44] and he says lo I must go and I must
[50:48] fight with the Prince of Persia so a
[50:52] demon had already been chosen because
[50:54] now this Kingdom and this Empire is
[50:57] fixing to be destroyed remember the four
[50:59] Great Gentile kingdoms of the world and
[51:01] a demon had already been chosen to be
[51:04] the anointed hierarchy of the kingdom of
[51:07] Persia and he's going back to fight with
[51:10] that so we get an insight into how that
[51:13] it was now that window of the
[51:16] supernatural it would open a little a
[51:18] little bit at a time and Prophets of
[51:20] course which represent the eyes of God
[51:22] see him they would look in there and get
[51:24] a little bit of Glimpse and then to
[51:26] sight God would shut the door back and
[51:28] then another one would open up oh this
[51:30] is one reason why I love the message of
[51:32] the hour so much because For the First
[51:35] time we're allowed to peer in to the
[51:39] sixth Dimension Into The Fifth Dimension
[51:42] into the seventh Dimension into the
[51:45] fourth dimension were diseases and all
[51:48] these things are we're able to hear
[51:50] communication we're able to see lights
[51:53] Shadows darkness and so on that we never
[51:56] had a view of before so God had allowed
[52:00] his Prophet to be able to break into
[52:03] that realm and I I love studying not
[52:06] only of course the Theology and the
[52:08] doctrinal side of the message but I love
[52:10] studying prayers of the prophet and
[52:13] hearing how that he would challenge
[52:16] those demons and the things that he
[52:19] would actually say to them and what he
[52:22] would call them and what he would tell
[52:24] them that their Destiny was now I can
[52:28] tell you already here this morning
[52:29] there's some nervous Devils sitting here
[52:31] right now
[52:34] Hallelujah now you know because of that
[52:37] why would we need why would the need the
[52:39] bride need rights well because the
[52:43] powers of hell is going to be released
[52:45] it's like there will be a gradual
[52:47] releasing remember this day brought to
[52:50] us the opening of The Seven Seals but it
[52:52] was not just the Seven Seals that was
[52:54] going to come open but the lid is going
[52:57] to be torn off of Hell and Hell is going
[53:01] to vomit out things that has never
[53:04] existed on the face of the Earth before
[53:06] there will be disease there will be
[53:09] oppression there will be possession
[53:12] there will be such things that people
[53:14] never thought imaginable on the earth
[53:17] now I'm not just talking about the
[53:19] tribulation period but I'm talking about
[53:22] pre-tribulation anointing which is
[53:25] already on the earth how many knows in
[53:27] the last few years you'll fight more
[53:29] than you've ever fought in your life all
[53:31] hell is against it and it's not just
[53:34] people that are Christians but the whole
[53:36] world is going insane that's why they
[53:38] have to have a pill to get up wanting to
[53:40] make it to lunch time one to make it to
[53:41] three o'clock break time have to have
[53:43] another to go to sleep by they're insane
[53:46] they're having to have all types of
[53:48] things to be able to make it what is it
[53:50] the powers of darkness is pressing
[53:53] against the people so there is then a
[53:56] great Warfare that is going on these
[53:58] beings which fell from their estate they
[54:01] have now been allocated to come against
[54:04] the people of God for those that have
[54:07] received the Seal of the Holy Ghost the
[54:09] devil can never get your soul again but
[54:11] he can oppress you he can afflict your
[54:15] body he can afflict your mind he can
[54:19] make you feel weary sad a failure
[54:22] anybody know what I'm talking about
[54:25] does that affect us as human beings of
[54:28] course it does but yet God wanted us
[54:31] more than any other age now I've read of
[54:34] course the writings of Paul looked at
[54:36] the writings of Luther where some of the
[54:38] writings of Wesley some of the writings
[54:40] of Whitfield some of the writings of
[54:42] these men I have found none of them that
[54:46] actually sold God using such a
[54:48] pronounced way to help the bride to
[54:51] recognize her position as she did this
[54:54] humble little simple man from Kentucky
[54:57] now it wasn't because he was an educated
[54:59] man no it was not it was because God
[55:02] chose him for such a purpose and for
[55:05] such a time as this in order to declare
[55:08] to us our rights and what they are so if
[55:12] we have this much of a declaration of
[55:15] our rights I don't think God repeats
[55:18] himself for no valuable reason Jesus
[55:22] would say it over and over again verily
[55:24] verily verily verily now according to
[55:28] the Aramaic which Jesus would have spoke
[55:30] Aramaic and part Greek you would not
[55:32] have to have that verily verily because
[55:35] one verily in the rendering from the
[55:38] Aramaic language would been enough to
[55:40] let this know this is an important
[55:42] statement that I'm going to say to you
[55:44] but Jesus would double it and say verily
[55:47] verily listen listen take heed take heed
[55:51] so if he says verily verily we better
[55:54] listen better listen and if he says
[55:57] verily verily verily we better better
[55:59] listen better listen better listen
[56:01] because it is for our good and everybody
[56:06] said
[56:07] so let us if you don't mind this morning
[56:09] let us look at a few things now that we
[56:12] can become a little bit more aware now
[56:15] watch let's allow the prophet to tell us
[56:17] some of our rights now here he is
[56:20] sitting here to make session
[56:22] intercessions on my confession talking
[56:24] about the Lord Jesus and I have a right
[56:26] to confess that he's done anything for
[56:29] me that's in the Redemptive blessings
[56:31] there you are what was the Redemptive
[56:34] blessing he was wounded for our
[56:36] transgressions Bruce for our iniquity
[56:38] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[56:40] him and where the stripes were healed is
[56:43] that right
[56:45] that's every believer's possession
[56:48] that's mine so everything Jesus died for
[56:52] is yours so will the devil just go back
[56:56] and sit in a corner and say well go
[56:58] ahead and take it then I guess I might
[56:59] as well just let you have it oh no he
[57:02] will try his best to Bluff you he will
[57:07] try his best and I remember those only
[57:09] one legal right that Satan ever has
[57:14] against a Believer only one but he will
[57:18] try to convince you that he has many
[57:21] many rights but Satan is a professional
[57:25] poker player
[57:28] okay now just take my word for it I've
[57:30] never played cards in my life so I don't
[57:33] know anything about poker anything about
[57:35] that sort of thing but I did want to
[57:38] look up the word because I found that
[57:40] the prophet uses so many times and it
[57:42] was a word that Satan was a bluff well I
[57:47] wanted to look that up and I thought I
[57:49] knew pretty well what it meant but I
[57:51] wanted to be sure and I found that they
[57:54] tied this to playing poker and I read a
[57:58] little bit about it to be able to
[57:59] understand so it would be like that
[58:02] there are several people sitting around
[58:04] and the stakes are high and there you
[58:07] know the this guy wants to win and that
[58:09] guy of course hopefully none of these
[58:10] brothers I'm poking point now play poker
[58:12] but they're all sitting at the table and
[58:15] nobody knows what anybody else has
[58:18] nobody knows what your cards are so it's
[58:22] the man who can have what they call the
[58:25] poker face or the bluff and he will sit
[58:29] there and bless you now you may have a
[58:31] better hand than he does you may
[58:33] actually have the winning hand but his
[58:37] face is not giving away that he's
[58:40] sitting there with Monopoly cards he's
[58:43] sitting right there and all he's got in
[58:45] his pocket is Monopoly money now he's
[58:48] hoping that you are not going to pull
[58:51] and really make him show that but if he
[58:55] can sit there and never twitch now
[58:57] remember I had a friend years and years
[58:59] ago in West Virginia they were on the
[59:01] board of Kentucky there in West Virginia
[59:02] he was a professional Gambler a man that
[59:05] had a heart toward the lord I prayed for
[59:07] him many many times he would go out west
[59:10] he would do it one time a year he would
[59:12] die he would die his hair he would
[59:13] change his looks totally because he was
[59:15] a professional card shark people was
[59:18] looking for him all over the world
[59:19] because he was so good and they were
[59:23] never able to catch him he would go one
[59:25] time a year spend a couple of weeks and
[59:27] live like a millionaire the rest of the
[59:29] year but yeah he was all the way that he
[59:33] did it so he learned how to hide his
[59:35] cards and he learned how to have that
[59:37] face and that's the way the devil does
[59:40] US many times he's sat now with Monopoly
[59:43] money and he's sitting there with cards
[59:46] and ain't a bit more valuable than
[59:47] nothing and you're setting up with all
[59:50] these rights in your head and he looks
[59:53] at you and he don't crack a smile but he
[59:55] watches your demeanor and he watches you
[59:58] when you live goes to quivering a little
[1:00:00] bit and your eye will go to jerkin and
[1:00:03] he knows he's got you because it's a
[1:00:06] sign of weakness and he keeps telling
[1:00:08] you it won't happen to you God won't do
[1:00:11] it oh yeah he's a Healer but he ain't
[1:00:13] going to heal you and you'll sit there
[1:00:15] and he'll tell you over and over again
[1:00:18] and he'll project that devil poke her
[1:00:21] face oh I feel like smacking that face
[1:00:23] don't you
[1:00:25] he'll project that look oh my and you
[1:00:29] will sit there and sit there and the
[1:00:30] longer he sets the more you're jerking
[1:00:33] and the more you're equivalent he's done
[1:00:35] got you whipped and yet you are sitting
[1:00:38] there with the winning hand oh my that
[1:00:41] it's already yours it's already mine if
[1:00:45] we will stand there on the promise of
[1:00:48] God
[1:00:49] notice he goes on to say you have a
[1:00:52] right tonight to enjoy the full blessing
[1:00:55] of all the apostles had this Word of
[1:00:58] Life Church believe that you have a
[1:01:01] right this is your Bill of Rights to
[1:01:05] enjoy the full blessing of all that the
[1:01:09] apostles have I don't want just the name
[1:01:12] that we're an Apostolic church I've got
[1:01:15] the right as the Son of God if I am a
[1:01:18] true Minister called of God I've got the
[1:01:21] same right to the Full Gospel that Peter
[1:01:24] had Peter ain't got no more right to the
[1:01:27] gospel that every God called man sitting
[1:01:30] in this building right here today
[1:01:31] and the church said
[1:01:33] oh some of y'all's eyes twitching
[1:01:36] notice again every born-again man is
[1:01:39] circumcised by the Holy Ghost you have a
[1:01:42] right for every Redemptive blessing let
[1:01:45] the devil rob you out of none of it
[1:01:48] and the church said
[1:01:50] notice again claim your legal rights
[1:01:53] don't let Satan press you on anything
[1:01:56] you're of God you're of God and he's got
[1:02:03] no rights to hold it
[1:02:05] now you see these demons they know how
[1:02:09] to Bluff because they work for the king
[1:02:13] of bluffers
[1:02:15] so he bluffed Adam he bluffed Eve he's
[1:02:19] bluffed right on down through time and
[1:02:22] he's bluffed me and he's bluffed you I'm
[1:02:24] going to go ahead and say it for you
[1:02:26] he's bluffed us many a time and robbed
[1:02:29] us out of the blessing of God and he was
[1:02:32] sat now with his Monopoly money among
[1:02:35] the actually God was telling him get
[1:02:37] back down to Hades you devil you know
[1:02:39] when that little thing on the Monopoly
[1:02:41] things and says go back home well that's
[1:02:44] why we're telling the devil get on back
[1:02:45] down to Hell devil you don't belong in
[1:02:48] my body you don't belong in my home you
[1:02:51] don't belong in our church you don't
[1:02:54] belong in my daughter you don't belong
[1:02:56] in my husband you don't belong in my
[1:02:59] wife get back down to Hell I am a
[1:03:03] daughter of God I am the Son of God it
[1:03:06] is my rights
[1:03:13] notice again he said if you're
[1:03:14] Christians and you have a right a legal
[1:03:16] right for everything Christ died for
[1:03:19] it's your possession you own it it's
[1:03:23] yours now the only thing you have to do
[1:03:25] is like Abraham after he endured a fight
[1:03:28] he obtained the promise Satan don't just
[1:03:31] let you take it easy you've got to have
[1:03:34] faith you've got to believe it and
[1:03:36] you've got to endure how many knows
[1:03:38] that's the hardest part all we can
[1:03:40] believe in this is yes sir with all my
[1:03:42] heart I believe it praise the Lord for
[1:03:43] coming by noon is it becoming oh my
[1:03:45] goodness it's already 12 months
[1:03:46] afternoon already and we're already like
[1:03:48] well if it don't come by three o'clock I
[1:03:50] guess it ain't going to happen yes a
[1:03:52] real believer says well if it don't
[1:03:54] happen today it'll be a bigger Miracle
[1:03:55] tomorrow and if it don't happen tomorrow
[1:03:57] be a better remember America on Tuesday
[1:03:59] or Wednesday but I know one thing I am a
[1:04:02] believer and I'm expecting my God to
[1:04:05] move
[1:04:06] that's right now let me bring this to
[1:04:08] you also on the restoration of the broad
[1:04:09] tree that the prophet who went to the
[1:04:11] Sunday morning service there's an Easter
[1:04:13] Service in 1962 and brother Neville had
[1:04:15] preached and unlike a lot of the message
[1:04:17] people that don't think they need to set
[1:04:19] under preachers brother Brandon had went
[1:04:21] through that morning and hurt by the
[1:04:22] Neville preach and by the Neville had
[1:04:24] preached an outstanding sermon but
[1:04:26] brother Neville closed out his thoughts
[1:04:29] with these words something about restore
[1:04:31] well brother random one home that was a
[1:04:33] daylight service or a sunrise service
[1:04:35] and then they come back in a couple of
[1:04:37] hours and brother Brown preaches this
[1:04:39] message a restoration of the broad tree
[1:04:41] I love it because he was not ashamed to
[1:04:44] say that he got the inspiration here and
[1:04:46] by the Neville preached
[1:04:48] well come on now that's a real man right
[1:04:50] there now once he said Webster says the
[1:04:53] word restore means to bring it back to
[1:04:55] the original to the former owner and to
[1:04:58] bring it back to a former state of
[1:05:01] condition and if a claim is made on
[1:05:03] something to make the restoration you
[1:05:06] can enforce it
[1:05:09] you can enforce it to make it come back
[1:05:13] to its right place and may God bless the
[1:05:17] feeble worse now he announces his text
[1:05:19] and what he's going to preach and he
[1:05:21] starts it out this way with this twofold
[1:05:23] aspect of it restoration and enforcing I
[1:05:26] don't mind telling you there's times
[1:05:27] that I need the enforcer to help enforce
[1:05:31] my claim
[1:05:32] now what's your restore is to bring back
[1:05:35] to who really owns it to restore us to
[1:05:38] bring them back to who really owns it or
[1:05:40] to bring it back to its natural estate
[1:05:42] where it was at the first time to bring
[1:05:45] it back to its natural condition in
[1:05:47] order to do this we have to have a right
[1:05:51] to enforce here's another one of your
[1:05:52] rights so you ain't just got a right to
[1:05:55] claim it but you've got to write as a
[1:05:58] child of God to call on the presence of
[1:06:01] the Holy Ghost to enforce that claim
[1:06:04] don't ask the devil to leave but make
[1:06:07] him leave
[1:06:09] well praise the Lord
[1:06:13] my mouth notice this he says then when
[1:06:17] we are we have the privilege to enforce
[1:06:20] upon Satan the claims that God give us
[1:06:24] for God has a law and his word is that
[1:06:27] law and God in this word will make
[1:06:29] certain claims to the church therefore
[1:06:31] we have a right to force these claims
[1:06:35] upon Satan
[1:06:39] I wonder how many of us here this
[1:06:41] morning beginning with me
[1:06:43] really sees this
[1:06:46] or do we not take the back seat to the
[1:06:49] devil he pushes us around he tells us
[1:06:52] what we can and cannot do he tells us
[1:06:54] how we're going to do in church he tells
[1:06:57] you now you ain't going to get in
[1:06:58] because I ain't going to let you I'm
[1:07:00] going to make you sad in church I'm
[1:07:02] going to make your mind go here and
[1:07:03] there and there you're going to be
[1:07:05] thinking about them sweet rolls over at
[1:07:07] the steakhouse and you're going to be
[1:07:09] sitting right there with that sweet
[1:07:10] potato of yours and oh my that cinnamon
[1:07:13] butter and it says oh somebody's fixing
[1:07:15] to leave right now you're going to order
[1:07:16] that Top Cut Sarah on and you're going
[1:07:18] to order it this way you ain't going to
[1:07:20] get nothing from church you need to
[1:07:22] smack that devil in the mouth and say
[1:07:24] get out of here you ain't the enforcer I
[1:07:27] am you ain't telling me what I'm going
[1:07:29] to get from church I'm going to tell you
[1:07:31] I'm getting a blessing I'm getting
[1:07:34] healing I'm getting what I need from God
[1:07:37] I need a touch today and I'm gonna get
[1:07:41] it today
[1:07:46] therefore we have a right to force these
[1:07:49] claims upon Satan and give it back
[1:07:51] listen to these words
[1:07:53] and he
[1:07:54] has to do it
[1:07:58] because we can take God's agent the Holy
[1:08:02] Spirit go right down on our knees and
[1:08:05] say it's thus saith the Lord he's got to
[1:08:07] give it up that's all because the holy
[1:08:10] spirit's there to make him do it
[1:08:15] now don't get in your mind that you can
[1:08:17] and I can't there's no way that we can
[1:08:18] do this on our own but the Holy Ghost
[1:08:21] has partnership himself with us and the
[1:08:24] Holy Ghost is wanting us to make the
[1:08:27] claim and then claim it in the name of
[1:08:29] Jesus and stand upon that claim and then
[1:08:32] the Holy Ghost will kick the devil out
[1:08:35] of your property
[1:08:38] praise be to God
[1:08:44] notice this the law of the spirit of God
[1:08:46] is to force Satan to give up that which
[1:08:49] he is unrightfully
[1:08:51] deceitfully taken from God
[1:08:54] Souls of men
[1:08:57] he took from God Souls of women children
[1:09:00] sickness of the body he placed upon
[1:09:03] people where God Made Them In His Image
[1:09:05] to be like him and the church is given
[1:09:08] the rightful legal rights by the Bible
[1:09:11] to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this
[1:09:15] upon them
[1:09:18] if Satan has robbed you of the privilege
[1:09:21] of being a son or daughter of God we
[1:09:24] have a right this morning by the Holy
[1:09:26] Spirit to enforce the claim of God bring
[1:09:29] them back
[1:09:31] if the devil is trying to assert
[1:09:33] Authority in your home pull your husband
[1:09:36] your wife your children away from
[1:09:39] serving God you need to stay in your
[1:09:41] ground and make her claim Satan in the
[1:09:43] name of Jesus you have no right to claim
[1:09:46] my husband you have no right to claim my
[1:09:49] daughter you're claiming them but I'm
[1:09:52] claiming them in the name of Jesus and
[1:09:54] the Holy Ghost is going to enforce my
[1:09:56] claim
[1:09:59] Oh Glory to God
[1:10:04] notice jump down in that quote a little
[1:10:05] bit now that this that's the enforcement
[1:10:08] restore it bring it back to its original
[1:10:10] condition a man sick a baby is sick a
[1:10:15] woman sick they're out of their natural
[1:10:18] condition
[1:10:19] then we have a right to enforce
[1:10:23] our claim not our claim it's our claim
[1:10:26] because God give it to us by stripes for
[1:10:28] heal he was wounded for our
[1:10:29] transgressions the way the stripes were
[1:10:31] healed now we have a right to enforce
[1:10:33] that law and the law Giver the Holy
[1:10:36] Spirit himself
[1:10:37] is here the ancient of God to see it's
[1:10:40] done that way amen now the only way he
[1:10:43] can work is when you let him work and
[1:10:46] you've got to believe it
[1:10:48] but are we afraid
[1:10:50] are we afraid it won't happen we're
[1:10:53] afraid well I've seen so many people
[1:10:55] mess up I have to that ain't going to
[1:10:58] stop me
[1:10:59] I ain't got nothing to do with me well
[1:11:01] brother Donnie I've seen all kinds of
[1:11:02] people make claims I have too but if
[1:11:04] they're between me and God that means
[1:11:06] they're closer to God than I am they're
[1:11:08] standing in my way let me move around
[1:11:10] the Scarecrow and keep eating butter
[1:11:11] beans
[1:11:13] now what rights do we have then watch
[1:11:17] the prophet again the devil's nothing
[1:11:20] but a scarecrow
[1:11:22] now I'm ugly enough to pass for one so
[1:11:24] I'll put my arms out
[1:11:31] now watch the Scarecrow four
[1:11:33] to keep crows away from something they
[1:11:37] want to eat
[1:11:40] now in this case I could understand how
[1:11:43] a scarecrow would scarecrows
[1:11:46] I don't understand how scarecrows scare
[1:11:48] Eagles
[1:11:49] since Eagles should have their eyesight
[1:11:53] not upon the crow but upon the cross
[1:11:56] I'm not looking at the crow today I'm
[1:11:59] not looking at a doctor's report today
[1:12:01] I'm not looking at how you feel how I
[1:12:04] feel I'm not just looking at the
[1:12:05] condition of the earth I'm looking at
[1:12:07] the promise of my God let that scarecrow
[1:12:10] shine out there and say oh you're not
[1:12:12] going to get it I'm going to knock him
[1:12:14] down when I get under the anointing of
[1:12:16] the Holy Ghost and say out of my way big
[1:12:18] boy I don't cash Monopoly money in my
[1:12:20] store I'm not taking your Monopoly
[1:12:23] promises I'm not taking your Monopoly
[1:12:25] money I have got real silver of
[1:12:28] redemption by the blood of the Lamb
[1:12:31] now watch the devil's nothing but a
[1:12:34] scarecrow he just scares you
[1:12:37] into something
[1:12:40] he has no
[1:12:43] legal rights
[1:12:46] at all
[1:12:49] so we have all the rights
[1:12:52] and he has none
[1:12:57] but I don't understand
[1:12:59] why does this seem like he's the
[1:13:01] Victorious one over so much of the time
[1:13:04] but he has no legal rights
[1:13:08] at all he has no legal rights at all he
[1:13:10] was stripped of every right of
[1:13:13] principalities he spoiled everything
[1:13:15] when he died at Calvary here he is
[1:13:17] coming down now Satan hasn't got any
[1:13:21] legal rights at all
[1:13:24] over a Christian do we believe this
[1:13:27] some of you
[1:13:29] the rest of you is thinking about it
[1:13:30] here
[1:13:32] Satan has got any legal rights at all
[1:13:36] over a Christian every time a man gets
[1:13:39] saved God just writes out a whole big
[1:13:42] bunch of checks like that and puts his
[1:13:45] name at the bottom
[1:13:47] said here you are fill them out are you
[1:13:50] scared of it fill it out whatever things
[1:13:53] you desire When you pray believe you
[1:13:55] receive it it'll be given to you is that
[1:13:58] right
[1:13:59] notice again he said he's absolutely
[1:14:02] legally
[1:14:04] defeated
[1:14:06] in every place the devil hasn't got one
[1:14:10] legal right at all nowhere
[1:14:14] but you know what I said you this I
[1:14:16] realize he don't have to have a legal
[1:14:18] right
[1:14:20] all he's got to do is hold his cards out
[1:14:22] in front of you
[1:14:24] and sit there and look at you with that
[1:14:25] poker face
[1:14:27] you're afraid aren't you
[1:14:29] you're scared
[1:14:31] you've never been this way before have
[1:14:33] you
[1:14:34] I can see it in your face
[1:14:37] I can see it in your eyes you say
[1:14:39] you're scared
[1:14:41] you didn't realize this would ever
[1:14:43] happen to you you saw you were above
[1:14:47] such things you are feeling shaken you
[1:14:50] are feeling torn up you and he's sitting
[1:14:53] there watching you
[1:14:54] to see if you're left out
[1:14:58] or you know some people just got that
[1:15:01] twitch about them when they get nervous
[1:15:02] and you don't tell them they're getting
[1:15:03] more nervous the more they're twitching
[1:15:07] and now he's sitting with his Monopoly
[1:15:09] card
[1:15:10] go to jail which is his card
[1:15:13] but he says going to hell
[1:15:16] that's on every one of his cards I'm
[1:15:19] going to hell I am lost I'm going to be
[1:15:21] separated I'll never have eternal life
[1:15:23] I'm going to perish I'm going to burn up
[1:15:25] that's what all his cards say
[1:15:29] can you imagine he said in there because
[1:15:31] the Lord Jesus is the one to hand them
[1:15:33] to thy say all of his cards I'm lost
[1:15:36] there's no hope for me there's no peace
[1:15:38] at all I'll have been Eternal separation
[1:15:40] I'm lost I'm totally out of
[1:15:42] reconciliation from God he's such an
[1:15:44] holds that hand and said and smiles at
[1:15:46] you like you wake God nothing
[1:15:49] looking right there when he sees it and
[1:15:52] he sees my destiny is

[1:17:56] all nowhere he's just the devil
[1:17:58] and a password
[1:18:00] and passwords get hacked all the time

[1:18:46] you he's a big old shadow
[1:18:56] now let's watch a little one-on-one
[1:18:58] confrontation
[1:19:01] I lay my hands upon her I condemn this
[1:19:04] enemy
[1:19:05] made it go out of her in the name of the
[1:19:07] Lord Jesus Christ come out of her Satan
[1:19:09] for God's glory for the fulfilling of
[1:19:11] the word of the Lord Jesus which cannot
[1:19:12] fail you are defeated you have no legal
[1:19:16] right Jesus Christ robbed you
[1:19:23] I just think that is so great
[1:19:26] the biggest robber that's ever been got
[1:19:28] robbed
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:31] well you know the Lord Jesus ain't gonna
[1:19:34] take nothing nothing from the devil that
[1:19:36] belongs to the devil so where did God
[1:19:39] what's he robbing the devil of what
[1:19:42] belonged to Jesus Christ
[1:19:44] you see the devil took you but you don't
[1:19:47] belong to him so what'd he do he took
[1:19:50] you away from the Devil the Earth don't
[1:19:54] belong to him Jesus Christ is going to
[1:19:57] take the hours away from the devil like
[1:20:00] he took the woman at the well away from
[1:20:02] the devil he robbed Satan for Glory
[1:20:13] you have no legal right to hold her
[1:20:15] anymore so leave her
[1:20:19] in the name of the one who died for her
[1:20:24] even our lord Jesus
[1:20:28] listen this no matter how much you
[1:20:30] scream how loud you scream how about you
[1:20:32] pray
[1:20:33] that Devil's got a legal right to stay
[1:20:35] there
[1:20:37] he will stay now listen here's the only
[1:20:39] right
[1:20:41] Satan can have as a believer
[1:20:44] that a Christian
[1:20:45] has unconfessed sin
[1:20:48] or something they should have done that
[1:20:50] they didn't do or they haven't made
[1:20:52] something right that's the only claim
[1:20:55] that he has
[1:20:59] got a right to stay there not only that
[1:21:02] but if you supposed to dumb something
[1:21:04] and didn't do it
[1:21:05] he has a legal right
[1:21:09] of disobedience
[1:21:15] so there's what it is so you calming
[1:21:18] that person and you find out just where
[1:21:20] the cause is
[1:21:23] me and Erica said the other day on
[1:21:25] reports and she said Daddy
[1:21:27] I'm just wondering
[1:21:30] have I done something wrong
[1:21:33] have I done something wrong
[1:21:36] why this has come on me
[1:21:39] I said honey
[1:21:41] as your daddy you know I love you don't
[1:21:43] you she said yes
[1:21:46] I said if you come to me and said Daddy
[1:21:48] if I hurt you somewhat
[1:21:50] of offended you
[1:21:52] you think I'd be honest with you
[1:21:54] she said I know you would
[1:21:57] and I said you've went to father
[1:21:59] and ask him yes
[1:22:02] and I said what'd he say
[1:22:04] she said he didn't show me nothing
[1:22:07] I said then you need to take that as a
[1:22:10] voice
[1:22:11] of Innocence
[1:22:13] a voice of no condemnation
[1:22:16] a voice of no give oh you say but he
[1:22:20] didn't say anything I take his silence
[1:22:22] as knows
[1:22:24] because if he loves me and I believe he
[1:22:27] does and I believe he loves you then if
[1:22:29] I'm sincere and I'm asking him father
[1:22:31] have I done something show me don't make
[1:22:33] it right if he don't tell you nothing
[1:22:35] then you take that reply as a command
[1:22:38] and you go right back to the table and
[1:22:41] look across at that liar and say to hell
[1:22:44] you go
[1:22:45] to house I go to hell you go to
[1:22:49] Deliverance I go you are a liar my heart
[1:22:53] does not condemn me therefore he hears
[1:22:57] me when I pray
[1:23:01] Oh Glory to God
[1:23:05] notice when he said thanks well move but
[1:23:09] not when he's got a legal right
[1:23:12] now listen to Satan knows
[1:23:16] what his righteous
[1:23:19] and what he hasn't
[1:23:21] got a right to do now all these quotes
[1:23:23] are some of y'all are hearing for your
[1:23:24] first time he heard him back in 54 53 52
[1:23:28] 50 51. he's been aware of this for all
[1:23:31] these years we're just now catching up
[1:23:33] to what he knows
[1:23:38] the whole time he was hoping and praying
[1:23:41] y'all wouldn't find it out
[1:23:44] today is your day to be exposed I am
[1:23:49] here to expose your high I am here to
[1:23:52] let them know you are a liar you are a
[1:23:55] bluff you ain't got no right on us you

[1:24:21] wow you have no rights to say anymore
[1:24:25] you are exposed right here from this
[1:24:28] platform
[1:24:29] your legal rights are gone
[1:24:32] your day is finished and the Church of
[1:24:35] the Living God is moving up into Realms
[1:24:38] of faith and you know that you are
[1:24:41] defeated and have been you're only a
[1:24:45] bluff
[1:24:46] you Bluff the people long enough as the
[1:24:50] Church of the Living God we take charge
[1:24:52] over thee by the Commandment of our Lord
[1:24:55] Jesus Christ and as his servant along
[1:24:58] with the church a Jersey by the Living

[1:32:51] legal rights Christ tripped him of
[1:32:53] everything it had at Calvary everything
[1:32:56] even fear
[1:32:58] everything was paid for it calvary and
[1:33:01] Satan you don't have any legal right
[1:33:06] over God's children they're God's
[1:33:09] heritage
[1:33:10] you can't hold them any longer
[1:33:13] come out of here
[1:33:15] I
[1:33:17] am a jewelry
[1:33:22] by Jesus Christ
[1:33:30] what's this Oneness of unity
[1:33:33] I now challenge the devil
[1:33:36] to a debate
[1:33:40] whoa
[1:33:42] now you're either nuts or you know who
[1:33:45] you're standing
[1:33:48] how about all these people the father
[1:33:50] believe the sign and they wanted to
[1:33:52] challenge me to Abate debate argue about
[1:33:54] this and they'll fly me here and they'll
[1:33:56] come down here and fly that I'll say why
[1:33:58] in the world should I take time to deal
[1:34:01] with some debate with some knucklehead
[1:34:03] like that one I've got more important
[1:34:05] people to debate with I mean I'm
[1:34:07] debating with the devil every day my
[1:34:09] goodness why in the world would I want
[1:34:11] to take time to deal with some little
[1:34:13] insignificant nothing can you imagine a
[1:34:15] prophet of God sending a man saying not
[1:34:18] I'm answering the devil's challenge but
[1:34:20] I want you to know devil I'm challenging
[1:34:23] you
[1:34:27] oh
[1:34:31] my god brother Donnie you're scaring me
[1:34:33] you're scaring me where are you going
[1:34:34] with this
[1:34:35] I'll tell you where I'm going with this
[1:34:36] out of this world out of this world
[1:34:44] I challenge the devil
[1:34:47] to a debate
[1:34:49] baked Satan you're aware
[1:34:52] you are whipped
[1:34:55] you have no legal rights Jesus Christ my
[1:34:58] Lord scripture of every Authority you
[1:34:59] had when he died at Calvary to take away
[1:35:01] sin and sickness and you're nothing but
[1:35:03] a bluff and we're calling your bluff
[1:35:10] you know that when our Lord came to the
[1:35:12] tree he cursed the tree now listen how
[1:35:14] he's talking to the devil
[1:35:16] he cursed the tree the next day it was
[1:35:18] with her and our lord said to his
[1:35:19] disciples have faith in God for your
[1:35:21] fuel say to this mountain be not moved
[1:35:23] to doubt in your heart you can believe
[1:35:24] what you had is coming to pass
[1:35:27] coming to pass coming to pass don't you
[1:35:32] understand that's why we miss it when
[1:35:33] the promise is coming to pass we're
[1:35:36] doubting it because it hasn't come to
[1:35:39] pass
[1:35:40] sometimes God's promises come to pass
[1:35:42] immediately sometimes they're coming to
[1:35:45] pass day by day hour by hour and we lose
[1:35:49] the victory because it didn't happen
[1:35:50] just like that
[1:35:54] I just taught this people
[1:35:57] that God is in them
[1:35:59] and if God is in them
[1:36:01] they can speak to that disease
[1:36:06] and say be away
[1:36:11] oh God
[1:36:14] be away from me
[1:36:17] and don't doubt in their heart right
[1:36:20] then
[1:36:22] that disease has to move
[1:36:26] for Christ said so
[1:36:28] for it's not them that speaks
[1:36:31] it's the father
[1:36:33] that dwells in them
[1:36:36] it's the father
[1:36:38] but speaking
[1:36:42] they're in need so come
[1:36:50] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:36:53] and no friends
[1:36:55] I'm not just reading quotes
[1:36:58] I'm speaking to Demons this morning
[1:37:06] I'm not just reading something that I
[1:37:08] think sounds nice
[1:37:10] I'm repeating the words of a Vindicated
[1:37:12] prophet and as I'm reading them I'm
[1:37:15] speaking to them spirits
[1:37:19] as I'm speaking to you
[1:37:22] to tell you
[1:37:24] show your hand
[1:37:28] and let him know you know he has no
[1:37:40] oh
[1:37:42] a challenge the devil in Jesus name
[1:37:46] he cannot defy the word of God for the
[1:37:48] word of God is deceived you Satan
[1:37:52] ain't that rich
[1:37:55] and you are strict
[1:37:57] of all the rights you ever had
[1:37:59] when Jesus died at Calvary he gave us
[1:38:03] the keys to the kingdom and you have no
[1:38:05] legal right in our bodies
[1:38:10] any longer we are Jews in the name of
[1:38:13] Jesus Christ
[1:38:15] leave every sick person here
[1:38:18] every crippled person every blind person
[1:38:21] every deaf person
[1:38:25] oh
[1:38:26] and you imagine when the prophet set up
[1:38:28] by this quote and wonders of unity and
[1:38:30] he says I challenge the devil to a
[1:38:32] debate this meeting had been one of the
[1:38:34] hardest meetings it ever had Waterloo
[1:38:36] Iowa 1958 the people sat on him they
[1:38:39] doubted they questioned they had all
[1:38:42] kinds of things actually makes this
[1:38:44] Challenge and he prays for the people
[1:38:46] the lion go to getting up the blind
[1:38:49] start seeing and all of a sudden you can
[1:38:52] hear it on the tape and here comes a
[1:38:54] mighty Roar and it goes
[1:39:00] like a mighty rushing wind
[1:39:06] and he said did you hear that
[1:39:08] did you hear that and you can hear the
[1:39:10] people as they are reacting he said that
[1:39:13] was the voice of God reacting back in
[1:39:16] the middle he turns around he asked the
[1:39:18] minister did you all hear that and you
[1:39:20] can hear them responding yes oh glory to
[1:39:23] God the man of God challenged the devil
[1:39:25] and the Holy Ghost showed up to accept
[1:39:27] the challenge
[1:39:29] oh roll it roller
[1:39:33] roll it
[1:39:38] remember when the demon act man the man
[1:39:41] that was possessed of the Demons
[1:39:43] the prophet tells us in 1956
[1:39:47] the head
[1:39:48] the chief of that tribe of demons
[1:39:53] you see demons still have their
[1:39:54] hierarchy
[1:39:56] and apparently the chief and this man
[1:39:59] was in pretty good communication
[1:40:01] what a terrible identification to be
[1:40:04] the chief of that tribe of demons made a
[1:40:08] challenge
[1:40:10] and the prophet said the Holy Ghost
[1:40:12] accepted his challenge
[1:40:15] the man come up across the platform you
[1:40:17] remember the story and he said I'll
[1:40:18] break every bone of your body and he
[1:40:21] said the love of God just come around
[1:40:22] him he said Satan in the name of Jesus

[1:40:43] her eyesight
[1:40:44] crippled Lane halt why the Holy Ghost
[1:40:48] accepted the challenge but they tell you
[1:40:51] something there's got to be a challenge
[1:40:52] first for the Holy Ghost to accept it it
[1:40:55] depends on how you look at your battles
[1:40:57] oh my depends on how you look at what
[1:41:00] you're going through it could be the
[1:41:02] Lord setting you up for the seventh day

[1:41:07] the final March around the walls of
[1:41:09] Jericho that the Holy Ghost is going to

[1:44:44] enlightened
[1:44:46] to that world
[1:44:49] I don't like that world Lord
[1:44:52] I haven't dealt with it near as much as
[1:44:54] many
[1:44:55] but what little bit I have and what
[1:44:56] demons I've seen
[1:44:58] and what demonic warfare that I've
[1:45:00] experienced
[1:45:02] I don't care a thing about it
[1:45:04] and at the same times the angels of God
[1:45:06] that I've seen before and they'll leave
[1:45:08] you paralyzed and numb
[1:45:11] your lips go numb your body's numb all
[1:45:14] over
[1:45:15] I'm not made to take that long Lord
[1:45:19] oh but Jesus I'm just so glad that you
[1:45:21] give it to us
[1:45:23] on the ability that we're called to
[1:45:25] handle it
[1:45:26] maybe some of these things they heard
[1:45:27] today they're pondering they're
[1:45:29] wandering
[1:45:30] but Lord
[1:45:32] may they break it down just in such
[1:45:33] Simplicity the bottom line is this
[1:45:36] they are more than conquerors
[1:45:39] and Satan is here to challenge them to
[1:45:42] make a coin
[1:45:43] Satan's claimed them for his kingdom but
[1:45:46] as a pastor I claim them for heaven
[1:45:50] Satan would like to claim our young men
[1:45:52] he'd like to get them caught up in
[1:45:54] pornography he'd like to get our young
[1:45:57] ladies caught up in this and that and
[1:45:58] the other
[1:46:00] he claims them
[1:46:02] but as a Shepherd a god-called man
[1:46:04] I claim them for the kingdom of God
[1:46:07] I believe one day when I walk before you
[1:46:09] Lord God some of these sheep is going to
[1:46:11] stand there with me we're going to be
[1:46:12] reckoned under the seventh angel of this
[1:46:14] day
[1:46:15] I want to present them to you Lord I'll
[1:46:18] fight for them I'll preach for them I'll
[1:46:20] study for them I'll pray for them I'll
[1:46:22] fight to my last breath
[1:46:24] and I'll challenge Satan every time he
[1:46:26] comes against them I'll counsel them
[1:46:28] I'll do anything I can do Lord to claim
[1:46:30] them for the kingdom of God I will not
[1:46:32] give them up
[1:46:34] Lord God if I die in the Pulpit so be it
[1:46:37] Lord God let me get my last breath
[1:46:39] standing for the people of God
[1:46:41] I've done it for decades of my life I
[1:46:43] give you my teens my 20s my 30s my 40s
[1:46:46] my 50s and now I've been to my 60s let
[1:46:48] me give the rest of my life to you Lord
[1:46:50] God
[1:46:51] let me fight for your sheep sickness
[1:46:54] comes against them
[1:46:56] Lord I I don't like demons
[1:46:59] I don't like having to deal with them
[1:47:01] I've seen them before the Lord and they
[1:47:03] scare me as a man
[1:47:05] I've seen them Lord in vehicles I've
[1:47:08] heard their voice
[1:47:09] I've seen them as they approach me
[1:47:12] but Lord God I'll face them again if I
[1:47:15] have to stand between them and your
[1:47:16] sheep
[1:47:17] and I'll take this little sling in my
[1:47:19] hand and I'll load it up with the Holy
[1:47:21] Ghost Rock
[1:47:22] Hallelujah and I I will meet the
[1:47:24] challenge of that demon power

[1:50:42] give him just a few hours she left the
[1:50:44] hospital and come straight to the
[1:50:45] meeting I was a Pentecostal preacher
[1:50:48] if the anointing under Pentecost would
[1:50:50] do that although the bride anointing do
[1:50:54] she come up in the prayer line and asked
[1:50:56] for my handkerchief she said his skull
[1:50:58] was rotten and gone

[1:51:03] cancer was in his brain into his skull
[1:51:06] all into there's no way for him to live
[1:51:09] you've heard me tell it before she took
[1:51:12] the handkerchief back to the hospital
[1:51:13] room the next morning the man walked out
[1:51:16] of the hospital and checked himself out
[1:51:18] with a new skull a new brain

[1:51:57] but a giant in front of you but brother
[1:52:00] sister it depends on how you look at
[1:52:02] them Giants the way I look at them the
[1:52:04] bigger they are the harder they fall can

[1:52:34] looking at it but the bride is the most
[1:52:37] Victorious body the most Victorious move

[1:53:09] the thing of it was the Lord Jesus
[1:53:12] marched behind the devil
[1:53:14] and looked over his shoulder and saw his
[1:53:17] hands
[1:53:18] and he whispered to me yesterday and day
[1:53:21] before he's got this card and he's got
[1:53:24] that card and he's got that card when
[1:53:27] you go to church Sunday tell them
[1:53:29] so the Lord then spotted the cards and
[1:53:32] he inspired me to tell you you're
[1:53:34] already won the game

[1:53:39] the Land There ain't no way for you to

[1:54:13] constantly fear not
[1:54:16] fear not
[1:54:17] constantly he told you
[1:54:19] why because he said the greatest thing
[1:54:22] that Satan can put on us is fear
[1:54:25] fear itself fear that you won't be
[1:54:27] welfare that you won't make a fear
[1:54:28] there's fear that
[1:54:30] maybe that's your greatest thing today
[1:54:32] Lord deliver me of this fear
