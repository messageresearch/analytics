opportunity once again we can be able to meet together like this and try to um answer some of these questions it's on people's hearts today I had the order of this the way that I thought I was going to go but as I sat later this afternoon praying and I just felt to kind of change it around a bit so first question can you explain why brother brandham is a Vindicated prophet and why the message is correct I have a difficult time speaking to why I believe what I believe maybe to a lot of people that question wouldn't have much relevance but to us as message followers it is such an important question and naturally as being able to understand it now you may not be able to explain it like a preacher would be able to but yet God certainly wants each of us to have an understanding and me' like to have a need on your heart before we pray God bless each of you heavenly father as we approach these questions here tonight Lord Jesus I'm asking you that you would help me Father help me to be able to get out of the way Lord once again that you can speak through me help me Lord as Paul said that I might be a an oracle of God that's an awesome responsibility placed on any human being but I pray tonight that you would help me Jesus shut my mouth to anything that would displease you make me sensitive tonight father if there's a need of a young person here or someone else even streaming and they need to hear something said make me sensitive to the spirit of God and help me Lord we're so grateful and appreciative of these Services these question answers I've heard from people around the world how that many of these people have had questions for years and years and it would be a question and a young person here would ask about it and there'd be multitudes of people that would get an answer that they have pondered over them so we see your hand in it so once again would you come and help us tonight father in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you each of you thank you for your attendance tonight you can be seated so can you explain why brother brandham is a Vindicated prophet and while the message is correct I have a difficult time speaking to why I believe what I believe and before we would actually deal with brother brandom instead of talking about brother brandom and going backwards what I'd like to do is to go backwards first so why is it that we even believe in a prophet why is it that we believe that we had to have a message in the last day what was the relevance what was the importance uh we've had the Bible now for many many years King James version 1611 we've had many versions thereafter so why would we need a prophet to come with what is called a message what does that mean exactly isn't Jesus dying on on the cross isn't that the message of the gospel and uh going to church and being a good church member isn't that enough to put people in the Rapture is that not enough to be able to give us a body chain so what we'd like to do is take a u a journey back to the scripture tonight now all the scriptures will be here on the on the screen and I've got a bunch to look at so I'll try not to go too fast but we will also have these on the website where you can go back and look at them but let's begin in numbers 12: 6 now remember God's nature if we can ever find the way God is then he cannot change in principle you and I change all the time and the way we view things and the way we see things it's because we learn more and we learn a better way to do something but God of course cannot do that numbers 12 and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among among you I the Lord will make myself known to him in a vision and will speak to him in a dream now this is God himself giving us at least two in this verse of scripture of the identifications of what a true Prophet will be that God will deal with this man in the form of vision and will speak unto him in a dream now our dream dreams um conclusive only to prophets no of course we all have dreams but the difference is that we don't have the ability to be able to interpret that dream now many people in the message try to take that on themsel and they say well brother so and so had a dream and I I think it meant this and I think it meant that but yet we know in the Bible that the only one that had the ability to be able to interpret a dream was a prophet the very reason that he did was because God showed him the dream in the form of a vision that's the way Nebuchadnezzar's dream was interpreted so the susers of the different people were around him and they could not they just couldn't do it they just could not do it so God showed the prophet the dream and a vision so he stands right before the king and said you saw this and this and this and this he said that's exactly right how did you know that how did you know that's what I dreamed so this is one of the things that God says also Deuteronomy 13:1 if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a Wonder Now watch how God moves in another stage now of a prophet so and numbers it was a vision or a dream but now he's fixing to give us a significant difference of how we'll be able to tell a false prophet from a true one if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or or a Wonder so now a man's not only seeing visions and Dreaming Dreams but he also has a touch of the supernal and the sign or the Wonder come to pass whereof he speak unto thee saying let us go after other gods I want you to listen to this how tricky it can be and the sign or the Wonder come to pass so a man will stand and say tomorrow about this time there'll be such and such and happen and you better take warning because it's going to happen by 10:00 in the morning something will happen in Johnson City and so and so and so and if it does that's a sign that one I'm telling you the truth and that William brandham is a false prophet and you young people better get away from it well say tomorrow at 10:00 that certain certain thing happens what are you going to do I'm going to say that man's a liar right why because what he's saying doesn't line up with the rest of the word now you see how tricky when you move Beyond visions and dreams into the re into the realm of Supernatural operation I'll be the first one to tell you I don't understand how Satan can be able to do it yet the prophet tells us in Harvest Time 1964 that Satan can hand out them Supernatural gifts by the handfuls you imagine the devil ain't handing out cigarettes ain't handing out marijuana joints and you know needles to shoot in your arms but to hand out gifts by the handfuls why cuz he knows everybody don't want whiskey everybody don't want marijuana Millions times millions of people want religion so he's got to have something to be able to give them that looks like God now the sign of the Wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto the saying let us go after other gods which thou Hast not known and let us ser them now this is what we're supposed to do according to the Old Testament Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God I want you to listen why this will happen now this blows some people's minds for the Lord your God proveth you you mean God would actually allow somebody to come in our ranks or come around sa in our church and they would have an anointing on them and they would actually start saying things and trying to pull people away from the message and away from the truth and God would allow that according to the Bible he will why to try you to try you you you and you to see will you stay with the word or will you you follow a a feeling a sensation or emotion a gift even though somebody can show you now what that man saying is not right it's not according to the scripture it's not according to the message of the hour you say oh but wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that oh my goodness that that that actually happen sure sure there are things that can happen you don't judge them by the gifts you judge them by the word and the young people said amen now know this this is your Bible now the dreamer of dreams for the the Lord your God proveth you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul you shall walk after the Lord your God and fear Him and keep his Commandments and obey his voice and you shall serve him and cleave unto him and that Prophet or that dreamer of Dreams shall be put to death now if brother Brenham was a false Prophet according to almighty God God should have never let him live for decades God should have took his life according to the Bible God said they're not supposed to live so this man which many people say was the worst man that ever lived on the earth the greatest false prophet I just find it a Marvel that people would think the greatest Prophet outside the Lord Jesus that ever lived on the Earth was a false one you mean God is going to be outdone by the devil God is God is going to be outdone by Satan and Satan is going to have a prophet that's going to be so great and have so many miracles and so many signs and wonders and God will never be able to go above that oh sounds like to me we're serving a puny God don't it you wow and that Prophet or that dreamer of Dreams shall be put to death because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in so Thou shalt put evil from away from the midst of thee now let's watch this come to pass and Jeremiah 2815 a Prophet by the name of hananiah Jeremiah 28:15 then said the Prophet Jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet so we got Jeremiah the prophet and we got hananiah the prophet so Jeremiah is saying one thing and hananiah another another Prophet is saying another thing altoe and yet both of them are called prophets wow so what would we have done as Word of Life if we were living in that day and Jeremiah said you're going to Babylon he comes in with a Yol he's got his arms in it he takes two big beams of wood they put it around his neck cut it in half slide it together put it around his neck he's got his hands up in it like this he's got chains on him thus saith the Lord You're Going to Babylon Nebuchadnezzar will rule over you hananiah comes in another prophet and picks up a tool and takes that off of Jeremiah and busts that yoke all two pieces and said thus saith the Lord you'll come back in two years so here's one prophet saying you'll be down there 70 years another Prophet now not a witch not a sser not somebody that works at a circus but a prophet H you see this is why I said it many many years ago if something like this ever arises in and around the message it'd be amazing the effect that it'll have on us because people don't know how to judge by the word they don't do it by the word so you can show them the word I've dealt with many people around the world and you show them try to warn them off from a false prophet and you try to give them words scriptures and message quotes and scriptures and message quotes and they go right on following it it's already happening Among Us in reality now watch this then the Prophet Jeremiah said unto haniah the prophet here now hananiah the Lord ha not sent thee but thou May make us this people to trust in a lie so here was the king and what hananiah was saying blessings and good things why the lord loves you why God's not going to send you down there to Babylon why that old terrible place you're the children of God he loves you so much oh he knows you make mistakes and stuff like that that old Jeremiah he's just so mean and so hateful and so contrary and hananiah was more of a people type of a guy so which do you think most of the people would follow they're not going to follow Jeremiah they're going to follow hanon but now listen at what God's going to do God's going to fulfill the very word that he said in the book of Deuteronomy therefore thus saith the Lord behold I will cast thee off the face of the Earths this year Thou shalt die that's what God said that's what God does because thou has taught Rebellion against the Lord wow so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month so if God would do that to hananiah because hananiah was trying to lead the people astray and God let brother brandham live for decades and according to a lot of the people that have left the message go right on deceiving people and deceiving and lying and this and that and the other and God let him live for decades and decades and let his message live on why didn't God cause some type of supernatural phenomena to where all them tapes would be automatically erased so it would stop deceiving people but instead of stopping it it's went around the world why is God not treating him the way he did hania well the answer is quite simple cuz God don't feel about him the way he did ananiah Deuteronomy 18:20 but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet say it with me what shall die you all believe God is a god of truth right oh why didn't God kill brother Bron why didn't God kill Paul now you see Paul was faced with the same thing in his day the galatian the judaizers in galatia come in after Paul founded the church and they started uh you know the devil is never the original missionary but he always comes in after other men of God go in and then do all the labor that he comes in trying to seal in their sheep so you watch who's the first one that goes out that's always the way Satan does it so he do the same thing in galatia trying to pull them Galatians and Paul said at one time you all would have pulled out your eyes because after you met the pillar of fire it affected his eyesight the rest of his life and the people would look at him and they felt so sorry for him because his eyes would water and he couldn't see sometimes you imagine a man praying for the sick and yet he himself can't hardly see sometimes and he wrote with large letters not a big letter as far as a book with many pages but he would have to write his Epistles in large letters and God heal the sick and rais the dead and cast out Devils through this man and he himself suffering this Affliction in his eyes and the Galatians looked at him and said oh I wish I could give him one of my eyes I wish I could Paul said at one time you would have given me your eyes you considered me as an angel of God even as Jesus Christ but have I now become your enemy because I've told you the truth so it was the judaizers from Jerusalem that now they started following in Paul's steps and they started following in missionary journey after he did to try to point them back to Judaism and where is that Judaism today where are those galatian followers dead where are the true followers of Paul here's one why God did not let his die come on children you understand where I'm going with this now watch and if Thou shalt say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord has not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if a thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him now why would God phrase this in this terminology that you're not to fear a false prophet well I'm not very smart but that would lead me to believe I'm not to fear a false one but I am to fear a true one right because that man has the word of the Lord that make sense to you so a false prophet nah we don't fear them but now keep in mind that a prophet can say something and it may not even come to pass in his lifetime you imagine Isaiah saying the Lord himself shall give you a sign a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child Isaiah 7:41 Isaiah 9 and6 unto us a child is born a son is given the Mighty God the government be upon his shoulders 72 years after he said it it finally come to pass I wonder how many people in his generation said that man was a false prophet so you see we got to be very careful when we're weighing the words of a prophet there's words that Moses said over 2,000 years ago 3,000 years ago that still have not come to pass those words that Zachariah said which have not yet come to pass words that Malachi said that have not yet come to pass so we're going to wait till Malachi's words come to pass and then retrospect we will look back and say well now I can believe that Malachi was a prophet no God gives us enough Vindication for present tense then that gives us confidence to know the future tense will also come to pass you understand now how are we going to judge brother brandom we'll judge him the same way that God told us to in his word this is the pattern that God gave to judge prophets in the bible and it has never changed so you know a true Prophet we have no problem in judging him by the word now notice in Amos 3: 6 sh a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in the city and the Lord has not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets so the Lord God will not do anything until he Reveals His secret to his servants the proph prophets now this is God's pattern the line hath roared who will not fear the lord God has spoken who can but prophesy now remember that many of the Patriarchs of the Old Testament as well as the uh founding fathers of the 12 original tribes they live their lives without an Unwritten word as you've heard me say that the New Testament Church went for many many years 25 to 28 years something like that depending on the span of history that you look at before they actually had a new testament so they never had Matthew Mark Luke and John but they had the word which had been handed down to them and they also had the Old Testament prophets now I realize many the denominational people look at us they oh the Old Testament is fulfilled it's done done no it shows they don't even know their Bible because as a said there are some Old Testament scriptures that to this day have not yet come to pass read Isaiah 65 what is that pertaining to the Millennium Isaiah 66 8th day Zechariah 14 Ezekiel 38 Ezekiel 381 all the way down through that whole chapter that what is speaking about the Millennium Temple not even come to pass yet Ezekiel 39 40 41 42 even over through chapter 44 so it's the seventh day which is the Millennium and also the eighth day which is eternity so those words of God that Ezekiel said when he was alive was a Vindication to prove to the people of that day this man is a prophet so you can trust when he speaks thus sayeth the Lord now what's this in Genesis 15:1 this is what makes a prophet so unique and so different in the day of gospel preaching now many of the Old Testament prophets never actually stood up and preached so they wouldn't get behind a pull pit and take a text and say preach 45 minutes or an hour or something like that but this is the way they operated the spirit of God needed a a voice of humanity by which he would project by Vision a word from God now prophets are made different than you and I whenever we have dreams we actually go out of our conscience State when we enter into that stage of dreaming whenever we go out of conscience and our heart rate and all that course still operating by the subconscious and we go into a a a sphere or a realm to where that we dream but yet there's a part of us that when we wake up we will remember you've had dreams and you've dreamed that remember you wake up maybe you've had dreams and you've had them years ago and yet you can dream it and yet there's other times you know you had a dream but it's weird and strange and you can't remember hard nothing about it well can you imagine then you're standing here right now and all of a sudden it's like you would have a dream your W your eyes are wide open yet I would go into the realm of dreams and I would dream as I did several years ago before Carol and I were going to Delaware on a trip couple of days before we went we owned a black 98 o mobile and a few days before we left for that trip I had this dream and I saw Carol sitting on the side of the road in this car the driver's side fender had been hit a little bit of the grill had been hit I saw Carol I saw our preacher friend wife with her so it really troubled me I couldn't I couldn't get it off of my mind I I just couldn't get get over so I finally told Carol I said Carol you know just just be careful so her and Debbie was her name was going going to go out so I I decided to tell her I said just careful she said should I not go I said no no I I didn't say that but I said I just had this dream I just had this dream I just want you to be careful so her and and Debbie went out and sure enough she had a wreck um they called us uh whenever I walked up to the car it was exactly the way I saw it in a dream now that dream did not need to be interpreted it was plain there was no symbols there was no figures there was no you know this and that and the other it was just a plain dream the way God the angel of God told Joseph fear not to take into thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost now the prophet said the reason that God did that was there was no Prophet alive in that day to interpret that dream so God didn't give it to him in the form of symbols now you can imagine the feeling that I had when I walked up there of course first of all I Gra Carol I wasn't worried about the car you didn't replace the car I couldn't replace her so I grabbed her and she's tore all to pieces and Debbie was tore up and there it was that dream had materialized now say I would stand here tonight and all of a sudden I would go out of this first conscience yet My Eyes Are Open I'm still talking and I would be able to have another dream except this time it would be a 2020 black Equinox setting I here and I would see Carol driving it tomorrow the next day and I'm I'm still talking about that and yet before my eyes I'm seeing that happen well that's the way a vision would come to a prophet so a prophet would have that in him I have to go to sleep to have a dream y'all go to sleep right so you go out you enter into that them gamble waves or what they call and go out of that then your brain gets that where it relaxes your blood pressure goes down heart rate and so on and then you get into that realm to where that you can start start dreaming but what is it your eyes are open and yet you can have a dream that's so real you might wake up out of that dream ah you ever had a dream like that maybe you're ringing wet with sweat or you're scared or whatever I've had I've had one crazy dream I've had it for years of my life same dream it'll be different you know a little bit different but same dream all the time and the dream is this that I'm smoking a cigarette and I wake up ain't that crazy man whenever I wake up I wake up in a cold sweat I've never smoked in my life it's just got to be a tormented devil but yet a dream can be so real and when I come out of that dream I'll have sweat on my face sweat on my hands and I'll be tore all two pieces but a prophet now would be able to stand there and he's looking right at you and yet you appear before him at the age of 12 years old and now you're 30 and he would see you I see you I see you coming home from school you're wearing a yellow checkered dress a dog gets after you and I see you run in on the porch and you open the door the screen door to go like through the porch so here he's it's like him seeing a video or a movie of this years and years ago and then it would fast forward and go from there like this and it scared you bothered you your whole life but now you're delivered it will not bother he could see people with cancer see people with all kinds of things and one of the reasons he would know that they were well was it would turn light over them and many times if they stand there a 30-y old man he'd see them as a 65 or 70 year old man and say go your way you're healed it'll never bother you again how was it Vision so it could go backwards in time it could bring him to the present and it could also fast forward and so what now you imagine a vision that a prophet would see and John on the aisle of patmas and he'd see all these symbols and all these things my goodness what in the world would all that mean he was seeing our day he saw his day he saw Wesley's day of course and he saw our day he's even saw Plum over into eternity sitting right there with his eyes wide open just like this it must have been very scary in one sense of the word to be around these men now watch in Genesis 15:1 Abraham was such a man after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision the word of the Lord now we have the word of the Lord in a Bible but remember they didn't have one they did not have a Bible but God had something he wanted to say well how's God going to say it well he's got people on the Earth that are receivers now you to see me every time I get ready to come out or any the rest of these ministers or Brother Louie we've got this microphone now this is called the body pack it's a it's it works off of Wireless it has the ability to be able to change the signal inside this part then there's a reciprocate part right up here and this is the body pack and the receiver is up there now if I go in here with a little tiny screwdriver and I'm able to adjust the frequency on this body pack unless I adjust that one I can talk and scream and holler and it will not work at all this and that has to be on the same frequency now sometimes we will have bleed overs and there will be because we got so many microphones we'll have to set the range so we've had to expand our wireless capability so that there will not be bleed overs to where you can control it separately now that's the way God does with a prophet to where that a prophet has a direct frequency so he is has the body pack what is that it's his ability to go into a trance he's just sitting there with his eyes wide open Abram Abram Abram it must be very bizarre to see them as as they would do that because they're there they're alive they're they're well but in one sense of the word they can't communicate with you because the body pack is so in tune with God that God is projecting his word right down through them praise the Lord after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying so the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward now listen carefully to me when these things are spoken they are infallable they are perfect now the problem is if these prophets would stay in this realm right here every time they opened their mouths then every word they said would be thus sayith the Lord but the difference is when you have preaching prophets now remember all prophets in the Old Testament were not preaching prophets so when you have prophets that would also be called to do the work of an evangelist then the word of the Lord through the vision is absolutely perfect but remember when they preach they're going to be like any other man they're going to preach according to their understanding level does that make sense to you that's why in the message and I know I've been hated and ridiculed and criticized through the years because of showing people in the message itself that brother Brandon was a man and that brother brandham told us himself that he believed this way and that way and he had to change it later people already think I've crossed the line and there's no hope for me they actually feel so sorry for you all they do they pity you all because you're still coming to church here because they think I've crossed the line I blast them the Holy Ghost I think my goodness how in the work could I do that when I was proven my point by quotes right I mean how can I do that if that's true then brother brandom crossed the line you understand I hope she help said hope she helps you understand now watch whenever this would happen it's phenomenal whenever it would happen this is absolutely infallable now let me tell you give you an example when brother Ram preached in 1963 and he mentions about Martin Luther King in the Sunday morning service and he says Martin Luther King is going to lead a million of them people to their deaths brother and sister Humes met brother brandham after service on Sunday morning at the grocery store so they went to him they saw him in the grocery store and they asked him brother brandom was that thus sayith the Lord people are tore up they're so tore up was that he said no I I didn't say that was thus sayeth the Lord he said ask me that question to not brother Brenham got a pen out of his pocket and wrote it on the palm of his hand so when they come back to service that night brother and sister Humes said brother brandham was that thus sayeth the Lord or were you just making an announcement now they did this at his bidding so the question is laid there brother brandham reads that question and then he gives them this answer which a lot of people that make him in will not quote this quote though they say they believe every word he said was thus sayith the Lord but don't make a lot of sense to me now I've told you be careful to what you're listening to because when something is being said or going forth it will always say thus sayeth the Lord so if every word brother R said was thus sayeth the Lord would somebody please explain to me why I would have to say thus sayith the Lord at certain times right I mean maybe I ain't too smart I didn't graduate from college like some of you smart kids did but if every word is thus sayith the Lord why would you in particular have to say thus sayith the Lord at certain times and why would you have to come back and say I used to believe the Virgin births I I I used to believe that Mary produced the egg I used to believe that epilepsy and I used to believe this and do a study sometime and you'll find a whole bunch of changes why brother Brandon was preaching from the best of his understanding at the time now this is why some of the people have left the message because they believed they believed the wrong thing about a prophet they had a prophet of their own imagination now you imagine Abram a prophet of God lying and saying that Sarah was his sister you imagine Sarah lying yeah that's right that's right we're just we're just brother and sister that's right that's what we are and not telling the truth could you IM imagine a man being so afraid of his own hide that he would put his wife brother Tim would you do that to your wife put your wife at risk of some man taking her because you're so afraid now was that thus sayth the Lord was it thus saith the Lord whenever Elisha did what he did oh there's hundreds and hundreds of examples of course it was not the prophet said when Elisha called the two she Bears out of the Wilderness to kill them 42 kids he said that was not God it was the anger of the Prophet was it thus sayith the Lord when Elijah said unto the juniper tree and said Lord I'm the only one left God didn't agree with him but God said I've got 7,000 and that's never bowed the knee to bail is that right so you see when them prophets would move out from under that Supernatural realm of vision then what you do you go back to their Humanity imagine a man that stood up against some prophets of Baal killed every one of them I mean killed them to the blood run down over the hill Caroline I stood there a few years ago where he come out of his cave and stood there and they've got a big gigantic statue uh it's just a phenomenal amazing thing to see and knowing that he killed them right down there in the valley he goes down through there and say you want more of it glory to God he come out to her looking for him you want some of it too come on come on you want some of it and then the anointing leaves him and Jezebel said I'll do the same to you and he takes off Running Scared like a little rabbit looking and hiding for looking for a hole to hide into that same man that stood there with the anointing on him like that my goodness wow watch how these prophets did now 2 Samuel chapter 7 verse4 and it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan saying for when David was up in the morning the word of the Lord came unto the prophet Gad David sear saying watch how the word come now so it came to Nathan then in 2 Samuel 24:11 the word came to Gad David sear again First Kings 18:1 and it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah I want you to notice it wasn't like that every day these men had words from god notice how the author said that it came to pass after many days I wonder how long they went from one word to another one and sometimes we feel alone they didn't have nothing written to go back to many of them it must have been a lonely Journey it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah so wonder what they went on in the those dry spells probably like you and I do well I I think I I wonder I I don't know wonder what's going on I I don't know I I don't have nothing from the Lord I I I don't know what to make of it where are we at what are we going through in the third year saying go show thyself unto Ahab and I will send rain upon the Earth 2 Kings 20 and4 and it came to pass before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the Lord Lord came unto him saying now this is after Isaiah has told the king set a house in order you're going to die he turns his face to the wall and prays and God turns him right around and sends him right back in and said forget that Li thus sayith the Lord this one's fresher now you on imagine well you say which one was right they were both right for the time but God heard this man's prayer and sent this Prophet so the word come in to this Prophet watch's Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 11 the words of Jeremiah the son of hilaya of the priest that were in anios in the land of Benjamin to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Ammon king of Judah in the 13th year of his Reign now you watch how that God would always have a prophet or a Seer as it would call the reason they called it a Seer was because he could see Visions now remember these men were not pastors per se like we would say okay well they meet they have counsel they have young people's question answers and then they meet with the older people and then they preach on Sundays and they preach on Wednesdays and then they preach special meetings that wasn't the way they done it they would come down with a word from the Lord and then they'd disappear they'd just be gone you wouldn't know where they at you wouldn't know where they lived M they might be gone disappeared for months at a time they were just waiting on God so this is the way God dealt with the Kings this is what he wanted them to have a sear God never made a king Prophet priest king that's reserved for himself never in the Bible do you find that Ezekiel 3:16 and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the Lord came unto me saying Ezekiel 13:1 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying so how did these Prophets get this by the realm of vision when this comes it's totally absolutely without error completely infallible now you see when brother Brandon would have those words from God like that that's why he would say this kind of a statement that if God told him or showed him a vision that George Washington was going to be raised from the dead he would call the world to come and see it and he said I'd say somebody get him a chair because when he gets up he's going to little bit be a little bit tired he can sit down in that chair but now when it would come to him praying for people let me give you an example of that so A man had had got injured and bruised and his bows bust out of his side it was terrible terrible situation and there calling for brother to come and pray for the man but he didn't have no word from the Lord so he he was talking to Sister me he said now oh me he said oh if the Lord Jesus was here he could walk in there at that hospital and he he could lay his hands on that man and he'd say be healed and he said I and yeah and he said you know what well if the Lord would show me a vision he said then I got to thinking shame on you why even if he showed me a vision it be them same same dirty hands he said that would lay on that young man so in one sense of the word now don't misunderstand me brother Bram and having those Visions was an advantage over you and I taking the written word because he had all the same scriptures we do lay hands on the sick they shall recover they shall cast out Devils they shall do this but when he had a vision a word from the Lord it was like oh my a Dynamo on top of that promise you understand but it also got him so dependent on that that he felt sort of afraid kind of like I do kind of like you do you see what I'm saying he said then I thought well it would be the same dirty hands if I went in there with the vision or without he walks into the hospital lays his hand on that man but they wouldn't even given him no chance to even live the man showed up in the meeting that that night what was it God didn't want him to have a vision for that God wanted his own face in the promise of his commission this is why brother bam goes there two or three times in the phase of his ministry in 1959 he talks about in 1961 apologizes to the people he said I pointed too much to the sign I've got to lead you to the the face and the promised word of God so you can imagine what a prophet would have this he'd say oh my my it it's going to happen there ain't no question about it it's definitely going to happen in one sense of the word young people your faith in following the Lord Jesus and his word believing it every day without this Vision Without this Vision you know the thing with Erica my daughter we we were claiming the promise God never showed me God never one time told me she was going to be healed and God supernaturally spoke to us many many times and our family prayer time with them but God not one time ever said she was going to be healed not one time there were other people that said the Lord told them this and this and this which did not happen but we were believing God's promise and we were taking God at his word and you say well brother Donnie wasn't it a mistake absolutely not it was not a mistake we were doing everything we were told to do that's that's general orders that's what we do you know what and I I believe it's all of my heart more people coming up with the same thing and every one of them that comes up with a diagnosis of cancer whatever I tell them this don't you look at Erica and say well y'all prayed for her what good did it do it was God's will to take her that don't mean it's God's will to take you so you look at it as an individual God what do you want for my life those people praying for her all over the world there was enough Faith prayed for that young and bless her heart that oh my that the graveyards could have been emptied out with all the people that was believing God you believe that I know you do so believing and living in that Realm of the word is a great compliment to your faith Jesus told Thomas Thomas you're you're blessed because you've seen but how much more blessed are those who have never seen and yet they believe any y'all here ever had a vision anybody ever had a vision and yet you believe God's word you believe God's word even without the vision you take God's promise don't you understand your Fai answers back to God and that's what draws his attention we believe his promise even sometimes when he won't say anything let me go on a few more minutes Canon notice this in Ezekiel 13:2 son of man prophesy against the prophets of Israel wow you talking about a battle these these were true prophets it wasn't just the soothsayers out there they had to deal with but they had to have false prophets among their own move Son of Man prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own Hearts hear ye the word of the Lord now this is why when the people the true people of God would hear this they say Hey you can Bank your soul on it write it down it will come to pass but there were other Israelites that heard Ezekiel prophesy and they chose the other prophets because they were smoother you see Satan's always had it he had a Han and I back there he had a you know different ones down through time and he's got them in this day Daniel chapter 9:2 in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood now listen this I love this by books wow so here is Daniel now he's went down to the land of Babylon him and his three friends you remember them you know them by Shadrach mesach and Abednego So Daniel had been reading some message books but it wasn't by our prophet of our day it was by his Prophet that had Liv before him anybody know what his name was Jeremiah so God had baroo which was a scribe that followed Jeremiah around Jeremiah didn't write but Baro wrote the books of Jeremiah and also the Lamentations of Jeremiah I find it so amazing because a few years ago they found in digging around the artifacts in in Israel they found down in some steps that had fallen down and laid there and they also found Timbers that dated back to 557 BC when the temple was actually burned and they found the signant ring so they wore their seal on a ring and they found the ring King Of baroo The Scribe of Jeremiah now that don't make me believe it anymore but I love to Scorch the devil with them sort of things you know you just think wow it's been laying there for all of those years and somebody down there just digging around and they found it now the word had been written now this is kind of a little bit different time frame than it was for Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all them So Daniel is down there in Babylon remember God said they going to be there for 70 years in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years now Daniel is also a prophet so he thinks now wait a minute isn't it about time for an exodus or what we would say a Rapture so isn't it about time that we're supposed to be leaving Babylon so you know what he does he gets the books of Jeremiah and he said I begin to understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem so they had these readings or writings rather of the books the books of Jeremiah and they was reading the prophet's books which a lot of people probably in that day would have said you mean you're still reading the books of that man that died years ago well didn't he die back in 1965 well that's what they'd say in our day so you can imagine you're was Daniel a prophet of God but now God has written word so notice how God is going to deal with this Prophet with vision but also direct him through that which is written now God could have spoke to to Daniel and just said now look the time is n but God's going to bring both together because the prophecy of Jeremiah and the prophecy of Daniel will merge right exactly together that's why brother brandham was not afraid to read the New Testament the Old Testament and preach from it because he was not a false false prophet his prophecy coincided perfectly with the prophets before him Hosea 1 verse one the word of the Lord that came unto Hosea the son of birod in the days of Uzziah josam ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of Judah now watch Once Israel and Judah divided God sent prophets to to Israel and he sent prophets to Judah but I want you to notice under the administration of Hosea that he was over several different Kings and their monarchy the word of the Lord that came un Hosea the son of bir in the days of Uzziah which was a king josam which was a king ahaz which was a king and Hezekiah which was a king but notice where he prophesied to Judah so he never went to Israel oh my you're talking about adoption and predestination and finding your spot it's amazing because the prophets of Israel never prophesied over to Judah and the ones of Judah never prophesied over there but they stayed in their ranks where God placed them and they functioned right there let me read one more scripture Canon then we'll stand the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pthu let's stand together I've got way too much more for us to go on now that's just enough to give you a little bit of a foundation then we'll pick it up again do you understand from the Old Testament why God used prophets how many understands let me see your hand you understand then why we why we see the value of God if he sent a prophet in this day the value not only of the thus sayith the Lords but of the teaching of that Prophet you see when Paul was here Paul would say I've received this from the Lord I got this from the Lord and then Paul would also say as one who has had the spirit of God this is not the Lord but this is I and I do believe I have the spirit of God so many people would say well brother Ram didn't say thus sayith the Lord I ain't taking it well that also means as part of the New Testament you wouldn't be able to take because the Bible also mentions about the traditions of the elders in the church so God chooses men to be able to write his word and speak it aren't you glad God loved us so much that he sent us a prophet we didn't just need a new pastor we didn't need a fiery evangelist or we didn't need a missionary that' be able to go and go around the world and tell people the same gospel that's been told for years and years but we needed a prophet to whom the word of the Lord can come to well brother Donnie can't God speak to you yes and he does God speaks to me there's very few weeks in my life that almighty God does not speak to me but God does not come to me in the form of the word the way he would to a prophet he would not come to me and give me something in the way that he would Hosea or Amos or Zachariah or Malachi or even brother brandom our prophet it might be something you know that he would speak to me to preach or I'll I'll give you an example I was down in the basement some time ago and I used to send Erica songs that I thought would be an encouragement to her and a help to her and it was from a playlist that I have on on iTunes and uh a song come up on there and it was one of her favorites that that I that I sinner several times actually and as I started listening to it I just become so overwhelmed with grief and I just broke down and started crying just uncontrollably and I said God you're perfect you make no mistakes I'm not questioning your wisdom I'm not questioning what you did but I just miss her so much and he let me say my peace and whenever I stop cuz I've learned through the years don't do all the Talking say what you need to say and let him respond and whenever I said that I paused and I stopped and he spoke back to me and said this if you could only see her now now that was his voice that was his presence but it was not a word for the this age it was not a word to get us ready for the Rapture it was not a word doctrinally that all the members of the Bride need it was something for me of course I shared it with Carol and some of my family members cuz I've been waiting for so long to hear him say something to me about the situation and I don't know why that he waited but I'm just so glad that I heard from him I love those times when he speaks to me but I don't have the gift like these men that we've read about tonight and the word of the Lord come to brother Daryl and the word of the Lord come to brother Ron Spencer and the word of the Lord come to brother Tim no that cannot happen it only happens to a prophet and God loved you so much and not only loved you but he saw our need for one you see it wasn't that God gave us just a little bit more decoration for this age or just you know I just want to add a little something extra to you all he knew he would be in such horrible shape and the Darkness of the world in religion would be so dark look out here you rub shoulders with them every day look at what what we we know and people that are religious you work with them you go to you go to school with them and what every more work with them and my this place is a very religious place is it not very religious but there's a great difference in religion and having the truth and God knew there would need to be a prophet that would come and restore the original Faith back to what the apostolic fathers had let's bow our heads Lord Jesus thank you tonight father for your word I want to say to you again how I appreciate the message of the hour we know know that the message did not come to replace our Bible you never sent a prophet in this day to replace us going to church letting our light shine witnessing to people letting people know that you're alive and you're the same yesterday today and forever but Lord what we needed was one that could catch the word for this day and it would not replace our Bibles or do away with them Lord I love my Bible now more than I've ever loved it as a matter of fact all we looked at tonight was scripture and there's a whole lot more where that come from but father we're so thankful that with this message comes light so when we read the Bible now we read it through the evening light and it gives us a greater understanding than we've ever had before and for that we are grateful be with these young people father strengthen them in their walk help them Lord God I pray in Jesus name amen I love youall I back on the road I've TR a seen so many times he carried me through and if there's one thing that I've learned in my life is my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true he everything he has said he will do and every morning his mercies are [Applause] new my redeemer is faithful and true my heart Rejoice is when I read his promise there there is a place that I'm preparing for you and if there's one thing I'll see face to face is my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true everything he has said he will do and every morning his mercies are [Applause] new my redeemer is faithful and true and in every situation he has proved his love to me when I lack the understanding he gives more grace to me my redeemer is faithful and true and everything he has said he will do and every morning his Mercy mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and [Music] true Jesus is faithful and true amen did you enjoy that tonight I can't wait to to hear the rest of that I I know I don't know why um today I was reading some some quotes today and kind of kind of coincidence or ironic whatever you want to call it but was brother Brandon was talking in the church ages and we talked about the Ephesian Church age he said that Paul was the pattern that God set for all true Ministers of God he said Paul's manner of ministering was the pattern that every true minister of God you know and you look at this age and God continued that pattern all the way down through the church ages and then we get to this church age they decid it's got to be different they get away from that true pattern that God said put him aside and they put a mechanical machine in that place to the very ones that said they believe exactly what he said he said the true pattern is a minister so you know when you look at that brother Brandon believed that CU whenever he said he won't Bey on the curtain of time and they and he said are all them millions of people that he saw he said are these brandom he said no these These are you the ones that you've led to the Lord and and they he said will Paul be there they said he'll be there with his group they said well if Paul will be there I will be there because I preached what he preached he continued that pattern that God gave him you know when you listen to brother brother Donny was talking about how God comes to the prophet when he comes up prophets to bring a message to the prophet when you come in here Sunday and Wednesday and Thursday night that's God's same way of speaking to you what he's given to the prophet and then he gives it to you you have to receive it in the same spirit that Prophet did because it's God's word so it's so wonderful I I I really enjoyed that and and and whoever asked a question I know it's hard to explain to somebody why do you believe in brother brandom I was with a buddy sometime this past fall this past spring and somebody asked us that he goes it's pretty simple the Bible said a word comes to the prophet first the guy was a Baptist guy said I can see that word comes to the prophet first God never changed his pattern you know he he you know we didn't get down to Le odyssea and God said I'm going to do something different still the same and and I'm so thankful for that so you know you know written Epistles read of all men you're going to preach Christ until they ask you about the messenger so you're not going to shove the messenger down their throat so preach Christ subject of the Messenger will come up promise you that so God bless you um thank you all for coming everybody give brother Rob hand he's back with us Sister Sarah good to have y'all he's the we're the two pillars so he's a little stronger than I am but so thankful to have him back and want to thank sister
