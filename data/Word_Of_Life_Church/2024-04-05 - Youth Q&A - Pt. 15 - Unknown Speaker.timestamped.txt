[23:54] Lamb just ask Brother D to come at this
[23:57] time
[24:02] [Music]
[24:10] praise the
[24:11] Lord I'm so glad whenever we gather like
[24:14] this where there's hundreds like that
[24:18] were last night or where it's a small
[24:21] crowd as we said this way aren't you so
[24:23] glad that he comes absolutely Every Time
[24:27] We Gather in his name
[24:28] that's his
[24:30] promise um before we start with the
[24:32] question answers several people had
[24:34] asked me about um brother Ron today and
[24:38] uh they was able to do his uh stin not
[24:41] only on the one that was 90% blocked but
[24:45] also the one that was 70% which they
[24:48] thought they wouldn't be able to do so
[24:50] we're grateful for that um last time I
[24:52] heard from Brother Andrew a few hours
[24:55] ago he was still having quite a bit of
[24:58] pain pain you heard anything any update
[24:59] on that still having the pain um so that
[25:03] did an EKG to check and see why that's
[25:07] going on but the think possibly that
[25:09] where his heart was deprived of oxygen
[25:12] that that's probably where that's coming
[25:14] from so we certainly want to remember
[25:16] brother Ron tonight I know we've already
[25:18] prayed but I know it means so much to
[25:19] him tonight if we'd remember him also
[25:22] those that'll be streaming the service
[25:23] you all at home please remember our
[25:25] brother and as I hear things I'll
[25:26] starting to keep you updated let's just
[25:28] pray together Heavenly Father we love
[25:30] you so much we thank you for your
[25:32] presence Lord Jesus we recognize you're
[25:35] here and Lord we thank you that whenever
[25:38] we gather together whether there's a
[25:40] building full or a handful you promised
[25:43] that You' make with us we're so thankful
[25:46] now Lord we've come again tonight that
[25:48] we might be able to bring it down on
[25:51] just a little bit de different level
[25:53] than a regular type service and how I've
[25:57] so enjoyed these questions Natures
[25:58] myself I've so enjoyed studying them and
[26:01] I just pray that it would be a blessing
[26:03] and a benefit Lord dear God we want to
[26:05] bring before you tonight our brother Ron
[26:07] I know all over the world today his name
[26:09] has been called before you and we're
[26:11] just believing tonight Lord Jesus that
[26:14] you're going to continue to be with our
[26:15] brother and just strengthen him and help
[26:17] him Lord we're grateful that they were
[26:19] able to uh do the stin Lord and then two
[26:22] more again today and they wasn't even
[26:25] sure they could do the one but we're so
[26:27] thankful that was able to do that and
[26:30] we're just praying that you'll be with
[26:31] him and strengthen him in his body you
[26:33] know the reason father that he's still
[26:36] dealing with this pain I know that
[26:38] brother Mark had texted me yesterday
[26:40] before church and sent me a picture of
[26:42] him and um he was on on several liters
[26:45] of oxygen oxygen even then so we're just
[26:48] believing you for a a complete healing
[26:50] and deliverance in our brother's life
[26:52] other needs here tonight Lord those that
[26:54] are streaming we pray that You' just be
[26:56] mindful of each one as we approach you
[26:58] tonight through these questions help me
[27:00] Lord Jesus that I can be able to get out
[27:01] of the way that I can surrender myself
[27:04] to you father if there's a need here
[27:06] that lays outside of what I've studied
[27:09] dear God make me sensitive to your
[27:11] spirit it may not be but four or five
[27:14] words that one Hungry Heart would need
[27:17] but it might change their life Lord so
[27:19] please help me that I can follow your
[27:21] spirit Lord help these young people to
[27:24] realize that it's not just important
[27:26] that I get out of the way but them
[27:28] pulling and them with an open heart also
[27:30] has such an impact on the service so
[27:33] each one of us are here tonight father
[27:35] reporting for Duty in the work of God
[27:38] bless us together we ask in the name of
[27:40] the Lord Jesus
[27:43] amen this is a really good question I
[27:45] really really enjoyed uh studying
[27:49] it brother brandham said that if a woman
[27:51] cuts her hair the husband can divorce
[27:55] her where is this in the
[27:59] Bible in today's age I don't think that
[28:04] cutting hair is
[28:07] dishonoring her
[28:09] husband the Bible says to cut is not the
[28:12] same as shaving of the hair now this is
[28:17] one thing that I want all of you all to
[28:18] always remember I want you to be able to
[28:22] be honest and I want you to be able if
[28:24] you have a question in your heart you'll
[28:27] never get a correct answer answer if you
[28:29] Doctor up a question and you just kind
[28:32] of present half of what you really feel
[28:35] about it but if you have a question you
[28:37] know God ain't going to strike and send
[28:39] Thunderbolts and Lightning Out of Heaven
[28:41] just strike you dead on the scene we've
[28:43] all got questions and one of the better
[28:45] ways for those questions to be answered
[28:47] is that we're honest and we just say
[28:49] Lord I just don't understand this I have
[28:51] all kinds of questions sometimes he
[28:53] tells you sometimes he don't sometimes
[28:54] he says trust me about it and what I
[28:57] like to to read as far as the scripture
[28:59] is concerned now about this question
[29:01] it's 1 Corinthians
[29:03] 11:3 but I would have you know that the
[29:06] head of every man is Christ and the head
[29:10] of the woman is the man and the head of
[29:14] Christ is God I find this so unusual in
[29:18] the way that Paul addresses this so
[29:22] instead of starting at the top of the
[29:26] protocol our instead of starting at the
[29:29] bottom of the protocol and working his
[29:32] way up or starting at the top and
[29:34] working his way down Paul actually
[29:37] starts in the middle of what he's going
[29:40] to deal with because he's going to deal
[29:41] with god with Christ the anointed man
[29:44] and then he's going to deal with the
[29:46] natural man and a woman so he doesn't
[29:48] start with God and he doesn't start with
[29:51] the woman but he actually starts in the
[29:53] middle I notice how he does that but I
[29:55] would have you know that the head of
[29:57] every man is Christ and the head of the
[30:01] woman is the man and the head of Christ
[30:04] is God so I think why in the world would
[30:06] he start it that way then notice there
[30:10] is a definite order to the way that God
[30:13] does things y'all believe that right God
[30:15] bless you you can be
[30:19] seated a lot of folks feel like that
[30:22] with anything with God you know that God
[30:25] doesn't like order but actually said God
[30:28] is a god of order by that I don't mean
[30:31] that uh God wants us so cut and dried
[30:34] that the spirit of God can never move
[30:36] Among Us that's not order that's dead
[30:38] religion and we don't want that but yet
[30:41] we know that God does have an order and
[30:44] there is a Divine protocol and God
[30:47] himself is the one that instituted that
[30:50] now in order to understand Paul
[30:52] addressing this in the Corinthian Church
[30:54] I'm so grateful for the Corinthian
[30:56] Church now they were they were the most
[30:58] most carnal Church in the entire New
[31:00] Testament that was addressed but yet a
[31:03] lot of our issues down through time had
[31:06] it not been for God capturing that stage
[31:09] of their carnality we wouldn't have any
[31:12] other any other New Testament places to
[31:14] refer to about hair no other place we
[31:18] wouldn't have none we wouldn't even have
[31:20] the order of the gifts we wouldn't have
[31:23] many things that we need and that the
[31:26] church has needed down through time if
[31:28] it had not been for God capturing now
[31:30] with a lot of other churches you don't
[31:32] find God capturing that infancy in their
[31:35] growth look at the Ephesian church I
[31:37] mean it starts right out with great
[31:39] powerful Revelations so if God would
[31:42] have just wrote about the Ephesian
[31:43] church church of Philippi Church of
[31:45] thessalonica all of them a lot of the
[31:47] things of the early growth stage of the
[31:50] church we wouldn't have have any
[31:51] Doctrine we wouldn't know how to even
[31:53] base it but God allowed Theirs to be
[31:56] captured I'm grateful for that aren't
[31:58] you you know it's the same thing with
[31:59] people's lives and people look at
[32:02] brother brandham and they want to
[32:03] compare brother brandom you know to
[32:05] other prophets of the Old Testament and
[32:07] brother brandom as far as capacity and
[32:09] understanding God allowed him to stand
[32:11] in a place that many of the Old
[32:12] Testament prophets never even was
[32:14] allowed to to stand but one thing about
[32:17] brother brandham is that we get to watch
[32:19] a prophet for the first time be able to
[32:23] grow and grow and grow for decades of
[32:27] his walk with God we don't get to see
[32:29] that with Paul we don't get to see that
[32:31] with habac Jeremiah Zephaniah Zachariah
[32:34] many of those prophets that part of
[32:36] their life is absolutely missing the
[32:38] only time we see about them is whenever
[32:40] they stomp out of the Wilderness thus
[32:42] sayith the Lord God said this and that
[32:44] and the other and they'd stomp right
[32:46] back in the wilderness and disappear but
[32:48] we get to see for the first time a
[32:50] prophet and as he's growing in his
[32:53] understanding and he has to even come
[32:55] back and say I had the wrong idea about
[32:57] that I had the wrong idea about this why
[33:00] God's allowing us to see a prophet as
[33:03] he's growing and being able to learn and
[33:06] one thing I love about him is that he
[33:07] can stand up and say I used to believe
[33:10] this but I was wrong as a matter of fact
[33:12] brother BR mentions about the Virgin
[33:14] verse that he used to believe that the
[33:16] egg actually came from Mary then God
[33:21] showed him and said if it would anything
[33:24] come from a human being a human being
[33:26] had some part in the work of Redemption
[33:28] and they didn't but one thing I love
[33:30] about him was he was a big enough man to
[33:31] stand up and say that he believed this
[33:34] years ago but he had to believe this in
[33:36] treport 1965 it talks about security and
[33:39] he said you Baptist Brethren had it
[33:41] wrong and he said I did too but when an
[33:44] angel of God stands and corrects you
[33:47] then you can stand and be corrected so
[33:49] we see the same thing then in the
[33:51] Corinthian Church so for the most part
[33:54] it was a Greek Church they were Gentiles
[33:57] like like we are here
[33:58] tonight and Corinth was a city that it
[34:01] was a Seaport City and they worshiped
[34:04] all kinds of gods but the main Goddess
[34:07] that was worshiped there was aarti there
[34:10] was others that was worshiped but she
[34:12] was the main one and in there some of
[34:14] these converts in Corinth uh they were
[34:17] former uh worshippers of aari former
[34:21] worshippers of some of these other gods
[34:23] and I mentioned it just briefly a couple
[34:25] of weeks ago that they would actually
[34:28] have uh their priest were not men but
[34:31] they were Priestess which were women and
[34:33] they Blended together if you can imagine
[34:35] it in your mind sex related types of
[34:38] things whenever they would come to
[34:40] worship and some of the the Corinthian
[34:43] uh Saints had become so identified with
[34:47] that they were bringing some of these
[34:50] things inside the Corinthian Church now
[34:53] you never find Paul having to deal with
[34:56] the women in their position
[34:58] uh in the in the book in The Book of
[35:00] Philippians and the book of Colossians
[35:02] and the book of Ephesians 1 and 2
[35:04] Thessalonians he didn't have to deal
[35:06] with it at all because they were not so
[35:08] affected by this worship so in Corinth
[35:12] the women were a lot of a dominating
[35:15] force and the women that become
[35:17] Believers message Believers if you wish
[35:19] to call them that they were bringing
[35:21] some of this same stuff inside the
[35:23] church now a lot of times people read
[35:25] the book of Corinthians and they feel
[35:27] like that Paul was being so hard on the
[35:30] women and Paul had it in for the women
[35:32] but we know better than that he was a
[35:34] true servant of God he didn't but it was
[35:36] such a big issue there was why that he
[35:39] had to deal with it so 1 Corinthians
[35:42] chapter 11 a lot of it is dealing with
[35:45] this whole idea of the definite order of
[35:49] divine headship now that is the Heavenly
[35:52] headship and the Earthly headship as
[35:54] well it's not only just in the church
[35:57] but it's it's also in the home life so
[36:00] Christ is the head of the man and the
[36:02] man is the head of the woman but I want
[36:04] you to notice now you know headship for
[36:07] a lot of the men and the message that
[36:08] I've dealt with over the years and a lot
[36:10] of the men they get this idea about
[36:12] headship headship headship and they run
[36:14] it in the ground and I'm telling you
[36:16] what their wives have to just about have
[36:17] permission to sneeze she about has to
[36:20] have permission to buy ketchup or
[36:21] mustard one that's not a head that's a
[36:24] dictator but what I've noticed many
[36:26] times and many these men that have that
[36:29] warped understanding of headship they
[36:32] themselves are not subject to Christ
[36:35] their head and you see this is the only
[36:38] way that we as men will ever be able to
[36:41] lead our wives and our children in the
[36:44] proper way and it's the only way that a
[36:47] man can ever really be a god-called
[36:49] pastor to be able to lead people in the
[36:52] Rapture because preachers will do
[36:54] sometimes the same thing they will be so
[36:57] so strong and so adamant oh you got to
[37:00] get permission I've told you before
[37:02] there's message pastors their people
[37:04] have to get permission for them to go on
[37:06] vacation they have to get permission for
[37:08] them to trade cars that's not a pastor
[37:11] that's a dictator his name ain't Hitler
[37:14] but it should be because that is not
[37:16] what God called pastors to be you don't
[37:18] need my permission to trade cars you
[37:21] don't need my permission brother Donnie
[37:23] can we go to Hawaii I'll ask you this
[37:26] can you afford it well if you can and
[37:28] that's what you think you want to do go
[37:30] for it you know I've been there I don't
[37:32] want to go back myself but whenever it
[37:35] becomes to where that you get a leader
[37:38] out from under the right headship
[37:40] himself then it will come on down to
[37:43] where that he cannot be able to project
[37:45] headship in the right way so this is
[37:47] what Paul is dealing with and I'm so
[37:49] glad that he did because it would have
[37:51] never been dealt with in the New
[37:52] Testament had he not so the real subject
[37:55] then that we want to look at tonight and
[37:57] that we want to discuss for a little bit
[38:00] is the subjection to Authority so under
[38:04] God's government there is a Divine
[38:06] protocol and there is a chain of
[38:10] authority and a woman is supposed to be
[38:13] subject to her husband who is supposed
[38:15] to be subject to Christ now listen so it
[38:17] doesn't confuse you Paul actually goes
[38:20] on to explain that Christ is under the
[38:24] subjection of God now some would look at
[38:27] that and say say oh my goodness does
[38:28] that mean there's two Gods does that
[38:30] mean there are two beings no it does not
[38:33] Christ means Christos which is the
[38:35] anointed one so what was the anointed
[38:37] one it was the human body of Jesus which
[38:42] prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane
[38:44] father not my will but thy will be done
[38:48] what was Jesus doing he was submitting
[38:52] his life now remember he come to the
[38:54] Earth as a human and he had a soul soul
[38:58] and he had a flesh body and he had a
[39:00] spirit and he must come as a willing
[39:03] sacrifice so he was not a creation that
[39:06] was projected of God that had no feeling
[39:09] on his own Jesus had human desires
[39:12] that's why that the prophet tells us
[39:14] Jesus was tempted by women he was
[39:16] tempted by drinking he was tempted in
[39:18] all points like as we are it must be
[39:21] done this way so the human sacrifice for
[39:25] our soul could be one that was willing
[39:28] not a robot that was pre-programmed I
[39:31] will go to Calvary I will die I will do
[39:35] this no he had to come to a SP a spot in
[39:39] the Garden of Gethsemane to where the
[39:41] choice was laid before him and that's
[39:44] the way God does us he don't want to
[39:46] make any of us serve him he don't want
[39:48] to make any of us pleas him he wants us
[39:50] to do it because we love him so God's
[39:53] Humanity which was Jesus Christ had to
[39:56] come to exact same way so he subjected
[40:00] himself and his Humanity to the father's
[40:05] will so then that's us as men those of
[40:09] you men tonight that are married those
[40:10] of you brothers that will be this is
[40:13] what we are subject to now I could give
[40:15] you all kinds of examples we don't have
[40:17] enough time tonight for me to but when
[40:20] you look at a lot of marriage problems
[40:23] what I've found is and counseling many
[40:25] people around the world in marriage that
[40:28] you'll find a man and if he gets out of
[40:31] the proper headship himself then he will
[40:34] throw the holy economy in his family out
[40:38] of headship then he'll notice the wife
[40:40] start having some credibility issues
[40:43] with him because no wife really can be
[40:46] subject to a man or sell if that man's
[40:49] not a son of God if he's not living the
[40:51] right kind of a life and she can be able
[40:53] to look at him and have respect for him
[40:56] because if she doesn't how can she be
[40:58] subject to no more than me so if y'all
[41:01] heard I've been caught drinking and I
[41:03] was smoking and I was vaping and I was
[41:05] doing all kinds of things and then you
[41:07] all are going to come back and hear me
[41:09] over and over again and you're going to
[41:10] hear me get on you and preach on you
[41:13] I'll tell you what you're going to do
[41:14] you're going to sit there and think how
[41:16] can he tell me to quit vaping when I saw
[41:19] a picture of him in the Johnson City
[41:21] prayers and he was vaping
[41:23] himself could you have any respect for
[41:26] me
[41:28] neither can wives have respect for
[41:31] husbands who don't live a Godly life and
[41:34] whose head is not Christ well praise the
[41:39] Lord now God is a god of divine order
[41:43] and God loves order now I'm talking
[41:45] about divine order not man's order what
[41:48] we are against and what God is against
[41:51] is man's order when man wants to
[41:54] Captivate and capture us and say you've
[41:57] got to do it our way uh I'm against that
[42:00] and God's against that but I'm not
[42:02] against divine order I believe in divine
[42:04] order so but when there is a broken
[42:08] continuity in the order of God there
[42:12] always follows a loss of power now it
[42:17] it's it's opposite the way the world
[42:19] would think because people think the
[42:21] more they give to God the the less
[42:23] control they have and and they don't
[42:25] have control of their Liv and they can't
[42:28] do this and they can't do that and
[42:29] somehow Satan convinces them that
[42:32] they're losing power because they're
[42:34] losing control but in reality the
[42:38] opposite is true the more we give over
[42:41] to him then the more he gains control of
[42:44] our life and the more he endues us with
[42:48] power from on high but the more we
[42:51] control of Our Lives the less control he
[42:55] has and the less divine power he will
[42:58] give us so it's exactly the opposite of
[43:01] the way that Satan will present it to us
[43:03] and when there is a loss of power
[43:06] there's also a loss of victory in a
[43:09] person's life now keep in mind headship
[43:12] is not dictatorship so the headship of
[43:16] the Eternal which was over Jesus the man
[43:21] it was not the Eternal dictating to his
[43:25] human body that we call the son son
[43:27] you're going to the cross I don't care
[43:29] where you want to or not you open your
[43:32] mouth and I will whip
[43:35] you that's not
[43:37] headship even in the garden father if it
[43:40] be thy will let this cup pass from me
[43:44] nevertheless don't you understand those
[43:46] words are part of the Plan of Redemption
[43:49] for you and I if he would have had one
[43:52] little bit of resentment I'm going but
[43:56] I'll tell you right now I don't like
[43:58] this at all this is totally unfair you
[44:01] mean I have to bear the sins of a
[44:04] homosexual I have to bear the sins of
[44:08] lesbians how can you do this to me how
[44:11] can you even ask me to do this for these
[44:14] liars and whoremongers this is this is
[44:17] not
[44:18] fair when people go to talking to me
[44:21] about fair I like to remind us of this
[44:26] Fair then their Affair it really just
[44:29] falls into
[44:30] nothing if he would have had one bit of
[44:33] resentment he could have never been the
[44:36] sacrifice that I needed that's what
[44:39] makes it so miraculous and wonderful
[44:42] that he knew all of this is going to be
[44:44] put upon him but he subjected himself
[44:48] unto the headship of this great Eternal
[44:51] the Eternal you understand could not die
[44:54] so God had to condem sin in a form that
[44:57] could die oh praise the Lord now in in
[45:00] the Corinthian Church this principle was
[45:03] being violated so the Corinthian Church
[45:07] coming out of that IM immorality it must
[45:09] have been a horrible horrible place so
[45:12] one Mark now listen to me now we're
[45:14] going to come to the to the question of
[45:16] the individual now let me read it to you
[45:18] again brother random said If a woman
[45:20] cuts her hair the husband can divorce
[45:22] her where is this in the Bible in
[45:24] today's age I don't think that cutting
[45:27] hair is dishonoring her husband the
[45:29] Bible says to cut is not the same thing
[45:32] as shaving the hair so now let's go back
[45:35] to the setting of where Paul wrote this
[45:38] about the woman having long hair and
[45:40] having power on her
[45:44] head how in the world would you have
[45:46] power on your head so one
[45:51] mark of a temple Priestess which was
[45:56] actually a
[45:58] prostitute one way you always knew the
[46:02] women of
[46:03] Corin when they were
[46:05] adulteresses and when they were
[46:09] harlots was they all cut their
[46:15] hair some of the Corinthian women
[46:18] started bringing short hair into the
[46:23] church now you can understand it had
[46:25] they got converted and they were out
[46:27] there in the world and they come to
[46:29] church and their hair was short they
[46:31] didn't know no different but they were
[46:33] starting to bring it in and still keep
[46:36] it cut so Paul is not trying to jump on
[46:39] the women but what he sees is the world
[46:41] the Corinthian World being brought into
[46:45] the church and they were sitting there
[46:47] and they didn't realize that by having
[46:50] that look they were still identifying as
[46:53] Corinthian
[46:55] prostitutes so actually it is in the
[47:00] Bible so it was a sign of
[47:04] disrespect to their husbands when a
[47:07] woman would cut her hair now watch this
[47:10] in 1 Corinthians chap 11 verse4 so it
[47:13] was a sign of a
[47:15] prostitute and it would be like a woman
[47:18] that would stand out on a street corner
[47:21] dress in a certain way most of you are
[47:22] adults she would dress in a certain way
[47:25] and you would notice by the way she's
[47:26] looking looking and and the city the
[47:28] certain spot of the city that she's at
[47:31] and all that sort of thing you know what
[47:33] kind of woman that she was so here these
[47:36] Daughters of God were coming into church
[47:40] and they led the Lord Jesus and they was
[47:42] worshiping and praying and actually some
[47:45] of them was some of the ones speaking in
[47:47] tongues and prophesying and yet Paul was
[47:51] looking out there on them and said
[47:53] Daughters of God you're looking like St
[47:56] street
[47:59] prostitutes oh my goodness now listen
[48:02] how Paul addresses this in verse four
[48:04] every man praying or
[48:08] prophesying having his head covered
[48:12] dishonor his
[48:15] head so every man now I want you to
[48:18] think now real carefully Paul is a Jew
[48:22] Now by this time it was already Jewish
[48:26] custom
[48:27] that men would at least wear either a
[48:32] shawl over their heads or the little cap
[48:36] I was in Jerusalem several years ago and
[48:38] before they let you go down to the
[48:40] whaling wall it makes no difference what
[48:42] you believe it makes no difference
[48:44] whether you're black white red yellow
[48:46] whether you're Jew Gentile it don't
[48:48] matter either you put that on the back
[48:50] of your head like that or you are not
[48:53] allowed to go to the Wailing Wall just
[48:55] up to you if you don't want to go fine
[48:58] because they've got guards there and
[49:00] they will put you to going so I wanted
[49:03] to go down to the weding wall I've been
[49:04] several years ago I didn't wail but I
[49:06] didn't want to wail either I didn't want
[49:08] them whooping me so they hand it to you
[49:10] you put it on the back of your head and
[49:12] of you ever seen Jews and they have
[49:13] those little things on the back of their
[49:15] head all right now this is totally
[49:17] opposite of what Paul belied notice what
[49:20] he's saying he's saying something
[49:22] totally opposite to Jewish custom
[49:27] totally opposite to what he's believed
[49:29] his whole life every man praying or
[49:31] prophesy having his head
[49:35] covered
[49:36] dishonor his
[49:40] head now listen same English word used
[49:44] but there's two different headships here
[49:47] so whenever then a man would cover his
[49:50] head and he comes in a prayer most of
[49:53] you boys know this from little bitty
[49:55] guys you never wear a cap into church
[49:58] why why would you want to see anybody
[50:01] stand up here preaching with a ball cap
[50:03] on although someone sent me a a a clip a
[50:06] while while back and it was a message
[50:08] preacher in a meeting preaching ranting
[50:11] and raving and preaching with a ball cap
[50:13] on and there was hundreds and hundreds
[50:16] of so-called message people there and
[50:19] the men had on ball
[50:21] caps and they claimed to be so revelated
[50:24] and so deep I thought and looked looking
[50:26] at it you don't even know First
[50:28] Corinthians much less anything else what
[50:32] a shame now watch this would have been
[50:35] so different from Peter and James and
[50:38] John all them Jews because his little
[50:40] kids they were they were raised with
[50:42] that tiis on them and they would go down
[50:45] they would never do it without that
[50:47] being there but I find it amazing
[50:49] because here now we got what I mentioned
[50:51] last night where could we go back to the
[50:53] Old Testament say all right Paul I'm
[50:55] going to check you out by the Bible I
[50:58] want you to show me now Paul where the
[51:00] Bible says this he couldn't have pulled
[51:02] up no Old Testament scripture I don't
[51:04] care what he done because every one of
[51:06] them would have done it he would have
[51:08] done it prior to his conversion but you
[51:10] see what God got what God did God
[51:12] dropped down a revelation in Paul the
[51:14] prophet's heart that the order of it had
[51:17] actually even changed from the time that
[51:20] Peter James and John and all them
[51:22] imagine so the Gentiles were coming in
[51:24] with their tradition and the Jews s it
[51:27] every time they'd go to synagogue they
[51:29] would WRA their they grab their Tice and
[51:31] bring it over the top of their head and
[51:32] they'd read the Torah Paul said oh no we
[51:35] don't do that
[51:37] anymore we don't do that
[51:41] anymore so every man praying or
[51:44] prophesying having his head covered
[51:46] dishonor his head so to remove the Hat I
[51:50] found this in history to remove the Hat
[51:53] the turban or the covering on the head
[51:56] is is a mark of respect for a
[52:00] superior when in his
[52:02] presence so then a man that would wear a
[52:05] hat or a turban or a tith or whatever it
[52:08] was whenever he would come in the
[52:10] presence of a superior and notice the
[52:13] law did not preach that I find it
[52:16] amazing because people think you can get
[52:18] away with more under grace than you did
[52:21] under
[52:22] law but when you really realize Grace is
[52:25] a great liberator
[52:27] but it also has some pretty strict
[52:29] things that you can and cannot do so it
[52:32] was a sign now that people were closer
[52:35] you know to me what I see about it is
[52:37] that the law could never bring them
[52:39] quite in that paradia which is the
[52:42] personal presence of
[52:44] Christ but by the shedding of the blood
[52:47] they were so much closer into the
[52:49] presence of God in the New Testament
[52:52] that God said' don't you men pray with
[52:54] that cross on your head because you're
[52:56] in the presence of one who is superior
[53:00] to your all so take your cap off wow
[53:04] isn't that
[53:05] awesome now notice in verse five now
[53:09] watch him contrast the man with the
[53:10] woman but every woman that prayeth or
[53:15] prophesieth with her head
[53:19] uncovered dishonor her head every woman
[53:24] that prophesies with her head
[53:28] uncovered so if a woman then will pray
[53:31] or prophesy with her head her natural
[53:34] head
[53:36] uncovered which is not Avail but her
[53:40] hair she dishonors not her own personal
[53:45] head but her
[53:47] husband so when she cuts her
[53:50] hair she dishonors her husband which
[53:54] makes her a dis
[53:57] honorable
[53:58] woman which is why they was put away in
[54:01] divorce so you see when brother brandham
[54:03] said that he was exactly with history
[54:06] and exactly with scripture every woman
[54:09] that prayeth or prophesy with her head
[54:11] uncovered dishonor her head for that is
[54:15] even as all one as if she were
[54:20] shaven so what does this Express then by
[54:23] a woman cutting her hair she's unveiled
[54:27] just by cutting it like the women in
[54:29] Corinth was doing so it is a token of
[54:34] her assuring authority over her
[54:38] husband and casting off that
[54:42] subjection simply by trimming her hair
[54:46] cutting her hair which God himself
[54:49] placed her under that so when the woman
[54:52] does that she's defying God because God
[54:55] was the one that gave her that ability
[54:57] to grow that hair so she dishonors her
[55:00] head now listen to this history here as
[55:02] well both among Jews and Greeks the long
[55:05] Tresses which is curls of a woman were
[55:09] her glory only in times of mourning or
[55:15] when
[55:16] convicted of shameful
[55:20] sin which was adultery you know what
[55:23] they would do to a woman who was called
[55:25] an adultery anybody you know by the law
[55:27] in the Book of Numbers know what they
[55:28] would do they would cut off her
[55:32] fingernails they would cut off her
[55:36] hair everybody that saw that woman knew
[55:40] she was an
[55:43] adulteress now this was also in the
[55:45] Greeks as well but it was the Romans who
[55:48] began to change it so when a woman would
[55:51] mourn and she would mourn a a mother a
[55:54] father a child something like that that
[55:56] then many times they would cut it off
[55:59] but notice in in Jewish law a woman
[56:02] proves she was guilty of adultery when
[56:05] she had her hair cut off write it down
[56:07] Numbers Chapter 5: 11 through 31 so Paul
[56:11] used two different words in 1
[56:14] Corinthians 11 verse 5 and verse 6
[56:17] shaved means that all the hair shaved
[56:21] off
[56:22] Shor means cut
[56:27] short either one would be a
[56:31] disgrace for a woman here again the word
[56:35] head it must be taken now when you think
[56:37] head head it has a double significance
[56:40] with a woman it is her natural head and
[56:43] her husband with a man it is his natural
[56:46] head and Christ so it's a type of shame
[56:50] that a woman brings upon her head just
[56:52] like it would be with a man that does
[56:54] not obey his head which is Christ the
[56:57] word so the word Shor if you go back in
[57:00] the original text for the word it is the
[57:04] Greek word which is KIRO ke i r o which
[57:08] means cut with
[57:11] shears
[57:13] remove by cutting verse six again for
[57:17] the woman be not covered let her also be
[57:20] Shor but if it be a shame for a woman to
[57:24] be Shor or shaven let her be covered so
[57:30] the Corinthian women who were cutting
[57:32] their hair were actually bringing
[57:35] themsel on a visible appearance to look
[57:39] like street
[57:42] prostitutes you imagine they were
[57:44] speaking in tongues they were shouting
[57:47] they were glorifying God and many of
[57:50] them were saved they were saved
[57:53] Christians don't you understand where
[57:55] that puts the majority
[57:57] of denominational Christians and they
[57:59] say oh hair don't make no difference it
[58:02] does it does make a difference that's
[58:05] why a man's not supposed to have his
[58:07] long it's a shame for a man to have long
[58:11] hair now notice the women then was
[58:14] bearing in thems the image of a typle
[58:19] prostitute the original word used for
[58:22] shame was the Greek word ason
[58:26] which refers to something that is a
[58:31] disgrace it is the neuter form of as
[58:35] cross which is
[58:38] translated
[58:40] filthy
[58:42] filthy so then for a woman to cut her
[58:45] hair or to have it Shor off just totally
[58:49] Shor off either one of them is a
[58:52] disgrace a shame or fil
[58:57] y
[58:59] so does a man have a right to put his
[59:01] wife away for being a disgraceful woman
[59:04] a filthy woman he does according to the
[59:08] Bible and if a man has that
[59:11] right so does God have that
[59:14] right so you see a woman then that would
[59:17] refuse woman naturally and church woman
[59:20] that would refuse to say I don't care
[59:23] what the Bible says I don't care if the
[59:25] Bible says my long hair is a glory unto
[59:27] me it it gives me a headache I'd rather
[59:31] have a headache than a whole body ache
[59:32] in Flames would you well it you know
[59:36] it's hard and people laugh at me and
[59:37] make fun of me let them laugh one day
[59:40] you'll be laughing and rejoicing down
[59:42] streets of gold and you'll be glad that
[59:44] you are notice this and Debbie evine's
[59:48] expository dictionary of New Testament
[59:50] words across is defined as that which is
[59:55] opposed to
[59:57] modesty or Purity notice now verse seven
[1:00:02] Paul goes on and says for a man indeed
[1:00:05] ought not to cover his head for as much
[1:00:09] as he is the image and the glory of God
[1:00:13] but the woman is the glory of the man
[1:00:16] you see when when a man and woman are
[1:00:17] joined together in marriage it's not
[1:00:20] like the man can just do whatever he
[1:00:22] wants to do and the woman can do
[1:00:24] whatever she wants to do and they don't
[1:00:26] affect each other they do so when a
[1:00:28] woman then cuts her hair she's removing
[1:00:32] the glory that God ordained I think of
[1:00:35] it this way that the woman according to
[1:00:38] what the Bible says a man indeed ought
[1:00:40] to not cover his head for as much as he
[1:00:42] is the image and the glory of God think
[1:00:45] of it brothers that God made us to be
[1:00:49] his glory so the way we live the way we
[1:00:51] act and all of that our life can bring
[1:00:54] glory to God or shame
[1:00:56] do you see the two main aspects that
[1:00:58] we're looking at glory and shame glory
[1:01:02] and shame no wonder Paul use these words
[1:01:04] shame and Glory so then a woman who cuts
[1:01:08] off her hair and she has that look about
[1:01:11] her not realizing that she's taking on
[1:01:13] the ancient image of a prostitute so
[1:01:17] this would have been advertisement to
[1:01:20] men on the street of that day I am an
[1:01:24] ill famed woman
[1:01:26] I want to sell you my
[1:01:31] body I am a
[1:01:33] prostitute I am
[1:01:37] defiled and I will bring shame on
[1:01:40] you then you understand why that God
[1:01:43] looks at the churches there that disobey
[1:01:46] him and God says I I can't let you be my
[1:01:49] wife I can't take you in the Rapture you
[1:01:53] were a disgrace to me you disgrace my
[1:01:56] words you disgrace my cause so God says
[1:02:00] I will put you away in
[1:02:04] divorcement oh my Lord Jesus I don't
[1:02:07] want that
[1:02:09] father but the woman is the glory of the
[1:02:13] man now it's amazing when you look at it
[1:02:16] that the woman now you think so it's not
[1:02:18] the man's
[1:02:19] muscles it's not the man can stand
[1:02:21] around I'm a great image of that right
[1:02:23] Hercules number three you know more the
[1:02:26] man said wow I've got this masculine
[1:02:28] profile the the the glory of the man is
[1:02:32] not how much he can lift the glory of
[1:02:34] the man is is the glory of the man is a
[1:02:38] god-given
[1:02:39] woman and when then that woman has her
[1:02:42] glory in the proper place she has a
[1:02:45] crown the woman has a crown and she
[1:02:49] actually crowns the man do you
[1:02:52] understand who's going to Crown the Lord
[1:02:54] Jesus he is not not crowned think of how
[1:02:57] long he's been waiting he's been raised
[1:02:59] from the dead for over 2,000 years he's
[1:03:02] been a high priest for over 2,000 years
[1:03:05] and he still does not have his crown yet
[1:03:08] what's he waiting on us because we are
[1:03:12] his crowning Glory brother Joel you're
[1:03:16] talking about us weak human beings us
[1:03:18] frail human beings and Yet the woman
[1:03:20] according to what Peter said the woman
[1:03:23] is the weaker vessel but God God chose
[1:03:26] the weaker vessel to Crown the stronger
[1:03:30] vessel us men God chose our wives well
[1:03:34] my goodness if being Carol would go to
[1:03:35] liftting weights you know ain't no way
[1:03:37] in the world Carol can compare I I can
[1:03:40] live way more than she can I'm way
[1:03:42] stronger than she is in many ways but I
[1:03:45] don't Crown her she crowns me like come
[1:03:49] on brother say Amen but you see how God
[1:03:52] does this order it's not like sister old
[1:03:55] you know men are the head and the men
[1:03:57] get to do this and that and the other
[1:03:59] but when you look at it God allows you
[1:04:02] to Crown this strength of this man in
[1:04:06] your life and then when a woman Rebels
[1:04:09] against that that's why God looks at it
[1:04:12] in the way that he does now whenever the
[1:04:14] glory of the man comes to her spot she
[1:04:19] glorifies not only the man but she in
[1:04:22] turn glorifies God by oby obeying his
[1:04:26] word and and the prophet even tells us
[1:04:28] himself that the woman has more to
[1:04:30] overcome than what we do and in one
[1:04:32] sense of the word sisters you'll receive
[1:04:34] a greater reward think of it when
[1:04:36] brother Brenham went beyond the curtain
[1:04:38] of time it was not the preachers that
[1:04:40] come to him first it was not even the
[1:04:43] men it was the
[1:04:45] women the women and the women of Leota
[1:04:49] thought he was so against them but
[1:04:51] apparently God let the sisters outrun
[1:04:53] the men they were so happy to see him he
[1:04:56] said it look like the quote I read to
[1:04:57] you last night he said it looked like
[1:04:59] there was a million of them brothers
[1:05:00] where in the world were we you know the
[1:05:03] sisters here they come I mean they just
[1:05:05] took off run and running they were so
[1:05:08] happy they were not you know brother R
[1:05:10] why in the world that you make it so
[1:05:11] hard on us in life they were taking they
[1:05:14] were they were embracing him and coming
[1:05:16] around him and then the brothers came by
[1:05:19] they were so happy that word had carried
[1:05:22] them beyond the curtain of time they
[1:05:25] were not the to pick a fight with
[1:05:26] brother B I've got a score to S with you
[1:05:28] you made it so hard on me they were so
[1:05:31] happy to see
[1:05:33] him notice Paul says in verse eight for
[1:05:37] the man is not of the
[1:05:41] woman but the woman of the man neither
[1:05:46] was the Man created for the woman but
[1:05:50] the woman for the man but when you look
[1:05:53] at honor and Glory again the man do not
[1:05:56] of the woman he did not come out of her
[1:05:59] but she come out of
[1:06:00] him but yet she crowns him don't you see
[1:06:04] Jesus in his church Jesus didn't come
[1:06:07] out of us we come out of him but we
[1:06:11] crown him oh
[1:06:13] Hallelujah neither was the Man created
[1:06:16] for the woman but the woman for the man
[1:06:18] for this cause now listen to this
[1:06:21] sisters for this cause ought the woman
[1:06:25] to have
[1:06:28] power on her
[1:06:31] head because of the Angels power on your
[1:06:36] head how in the world would you have
[1:06:39] power on your
[1:06:41] head look at this word you've heard me
[1:06:44] use it many many times it's the Greek
[1:06:47] word
[1:06:48] exusia which is Authority right
[1:06:53] jurisdiction the power of authority
[1:06:57] influence the power of rule or
[1:07:02] government so a woman has power on her
[1:07:06] head when she leaves her hair uncut now
[1:07:09] remember there are sisters and I've been
[1:07:12] in different parts of Africa sub Sahara
[1:07:14] Africa and a lot of the sisters there
[1:07:17] their hair oh my I mean hundreds and
[1:07:20] hundreds of them it just won't grow long
[1:07:23] it's it's very curly and it won't grow
[1:07:25] WR and and I have been asked this
[1:07:26] question over and over and over again by
[1:07:30] the African sisters and you don't
[1:07:33] realize how they look at you on video
[1:07:36] and how envious they are of your long
[1:07:39] hair and many of them think I don't have
[1:07:42] long hair I don't have long hair but
[1:07:45] when you look at the word long it's not
[1:07:47] measuring in length so much but it's
[1:07:51] uncut not trimmed hair oh it's amazing
[1:07:55] whenever you're able to stand there and
[1:07:57] say but sisters do you cut your oh no
[1:08:00] brother no brother no I said then you
[1:08:03] have biblical long hair because it's
[1:08:07] uncut hair they feel like shouting oh
[1:08:11] brother brother thank you thank you
[1:08:13] thank you they feel like hugging you but
[1:08:15] we're not in the sixth Dimension yet so
[1:08:17] that ain't possible but for them to be
[1:08:19] free because they feel like I don't have
[1:08:22] long hair would I not be bride Oh Praise
[1:08:25] the Lord don't you just love God's
[1:08:28] word now listen Paul says for this cause
[1:08:31] an au the woman to have power excuse you
[1:08:35] look at also another meaning of this
[1:08:36] word it's the power of him whose will
[1:08:40] and commands must be submitted to by
[1:08:44] others and
[1:08:46] obeyed and listen to this last part a
[1:08:50] sign of a husband's
[1:08:53] authority over his
[1:08:57] wife and you know what gets me is every
[1:09:00] Baptist Theologian every Methodist
[1:09:03] Theologian if they really are Theologian
[1:09:05] every Presbyterian every Catholic priest
[1:09:08] a lot of these Pentecostals if they have
[1:09:11] the uh just a Greek dictionary is all
[1:09:13] they need and to look up this word they
[1:09:15] know this word just like we do so what
[1:09:18] do they do when they preach it they have
[1:09:21] to leave this part out especially if
[1:09:23] their wife Cuts their head
[1:09:27] so right here is the word that Paul
[1:09:29] chose to use of a woman having power on
[1:09:33] her head so it's a sign of a husband's
[1:09:38] authority over his wife the sign of
[1:09:44] Regal
[1:09:47] Authority
[1:09:50] Crown a sign of Regal Authority
[1:09:56] or a
[1:09:58] crown my goodness so Paul was telling
[1:10:02] them sister not no doubt whenever they
[1:10:04] received this letter because Paul wasn't
[1:10:06] actually there to preach this in person
[1:10:08] he was in prison as a matter of fact but
[1:10:10] whenever they received this
[1:10:12] letter and there's probably sister
[1:10:14] sitting there and the minister would
[1:10:16] have got up behind the pull pit and said
[1:10:18] now Saints you know we've got a new
[1:10:19] letter from the prophet of God and in
[1:10:22] that day think about it many of the
[1:10:24] people there did not acknowledge Him as
[1:10:26] any Prophet so they would have just been
[1:10:28] standing up and they were reading
[1:10:32] quotes they were reading
[1:10:35] quotes out of these
[1:10:37] books hello they were reading quotes out
[1:10:41] of these books and the majority of the
[1:10:43] world thought Paul was an absolute nut
[1:10:45] and they said what do they do at that
[1:10:47] church well somebody told me them
[1:10:49] preachers get up there and they read
[1:10:51] quotes out of this man well is that man
[1:10:54] where's he at why somebody told me he's
[1:10:56] in prison oh Lord that must be a cult
[1:10:59] ain't it you mean they you mean they
[1:11:01] don't even stand up there why somebody
[1:11:03] told me they don't even take their text
[1:11:05] out of all the Old Testament Scrolls why
[1:11:08] Paul don't even stand up bur and read
[1:11:10] the book of Genesis or Exodus or
[1:11:11] Leviticus or Numbers Deuteronomy oh my
[1:11:14] Lord I cannot believe what do they
[1:11:16] preach you ever heard that man named
[1:11:18] Matthew Matthew oh yeah was he the tax
[1:11:21] collector Guy Somebody told me he got
[1:11:23] saved and he turned into an author and
[1:11:24] wrote some book a tell all book about
[1:11:27] Jesus or something you mean and that's
[1:11:29] what they're preaching them bunch of
[1:11:32] heathens oh my goodness you imagine the
[1:11:34] scribes and the Pharisees they just
[1:11:36] blast them into the pits I cannot
[1:11:38] believe these people have pulled away
[1:11:40] and joined this cult and they stand up
[1:11:43] there and read
[1:11:45] quotes if it had been modern day they'
[1:11:47] have projected them on the screen
[1:11:49] wouldn't
[1:11:50] they don't you see we are being
[1:11:54] criticized like our brothers and sisters
[1:11:57] in the first
[1:11:58] century I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[1:12:04] them now notice Paul brings it now what
[1:12:08] would you and I have ever thought a
[1:12:11] woman having long hair uncut hair would
[1:12:14] have ever given her power and a royal a
[1:12:19] Regal Authority and actually a
[1:12:23] crown now Paul says that for this cause
[1:12:26] ought the woman to have power on her
[1:12:29] head not a veil not a piece of
[1:12:33] material but her
[1:12:35] hair power on her head
[1:12:40] because of the
[1:12:43] Angels
[1:12:45] angilos
[1:12:46] messenger one who has
[1:12:49] sent a messenger from God now the
[1:12:53] prophet refers to this and he said said
[1:12:55] they better have long hair cuz when that
[1:12:58] messenger comes he'll blast
[1:13:01] them but you know when you look at long
[1:13:04] hair and the
[1:13:06] angels Paul also wanted them to
[1:13:09] recognize that Angels were in their
[1:13:14] services and that Angels would have
[1:13:17] taken
[1:13:18] note of them women with that cut
[1:13:22] hair you cannot imagine how
[1:13:26] repulsive that this would have been to
[1:13:28] an angel who has never
[1:13:31] disobeyed one
[1:13:35] word never disobeyed one word and they
[1:13:38] are a sign they were here last night
[1:13:40] they'll be here again Sunday they're all
[1:13:42] over the Earth with the saints of God so
[1:13:44] the the Angels come and they will watch
[1:13:49] the impropriety or the
[1:13:51] misconduct of people in the church and
[1:13:54] they look at Adam and they're trying to
[1:13:56] relate they're trying to understand
[1:13:57] Grace and they're trying to understand
[1:13:59] all this that God is doing and yet the
[1:14:01] angels of God it would bring them such
[1:14:05] Delight in the subordination of the
[1:14:08] people that fall in the proper order of
[1:14:12] the divine order of God so when the
[1:14:14] angels of God see say a preacher like me
[1:14:18] and I will I will get an idea and I'll
[1:14:20] get a thought about this that and the
[1:14:21] other and I'm thinking oh wow my my boy
[1:14:23] that sounds so good so I'll go to look
[1:14:26] in the Bible and I'll go to look in here
[1:14:27] and then I'll go to look in the message
[1:14:29] and then I say oh praise the lord it's
[1:14:31] scriptural it's message it's good I I
[1:14:33] like to tear down my own sermons first
[1:14:36] because I get all kinds of critics so I
[1:14:38] like to look at it make sure if I can
[1:14:40] tear it down somebody else can do so I
[1:14:42] want to make sure that it's right so
[1:14:45] when I present you the truth I want to
[1:14:46] know what I'm talking about so whenever
[1:14:49] I stand there and I run it through Paul
[1:14:52] I run it through the prophet of this age
[1:14:53] I run it through the Bible and then I'll
[1:14:55] Stand Up and preach it to you the angels
[1:14:57] of God are here on the platform they're
[1:14:59] here in the building and it brings them
[1:15:02] such pleasure that A Gifted Man did not
[1:15:06] say I'm so gifted I really don't need to
[1:15:09] prove this by Paul I'm so gifted I don't
[1:15:12] really need to run this through the
[1:15:13] message I think I'll just say what I
[1:15:16] think is right about this
[1:15:18] situation but when the Angels see me and
[1:15:21] the other men of God around the world
[1:15:23] and they want to see them oh we're
[1:15:25] subordinates we are AR we not we're
[1:15:27] subordinates and the angels of God can
[1:15:30] see and be able to relate that's the way
[1:15:34] I've always
[1:15:35] done well I can't say
[1:15:37] that because I've missed him before
[1:15:41] haven't we all but the angels of God
[1:15:44] when they those Holy Angels they can say
[1:15:47] I've never messed
[1:15:48] up I've always obeyed
[1:15:52] him those beings might be milons ions of
[1:15:55] years old we don't
[1:15:57] know and yet you and I have to say oh my
[1:16:00] goodness I've made so many mistakes I
[1:16:02] couldn't even count them oh no how in
[1:16:05] the world can I compare to an angel well
[1:16:07] in that sense you
[1:16:08] can't but what God has done for us is so
[1:16:11] great that they peer over and look into
[1:16:13] it and the angels of God you imagine
[1:16:16] them being around so the insubordination
[1:16:19] of women that would cut their hair or
[1:16:21] men that would not be under their head
[1:16:23] Christ the Angels must be left in in
[1:16:28] offense and it would offend them how
[1:16:31] could you all do that how could you
[1:16:34] women cut off your
[1:16:37] crown so when women cut their
[1:16:40] hair they're removing their glory and
[1:16:44] they're removing their Crown by which
[1:16:48] they are to Crown their husband by
[1:16:50] subjection they're reaching up and
[1:16:53] pulling it off and throwing it on the
[1:16:56] floor where their hair lays when The
[1:17:00] Beautician cuts it
[1:17:04] off now believe it or not I've seen
[1:17:06] women come in the barber shop where I
[1:17:09] go and they get it cut so short that
[1:17:13] I've actually left with mine a little
[1:17:14] bit longer than theirs
[1:17:16] were and you're talking about weird when
[1:17:19] you go in and sit down in a barber chair
[1:17:20] and there's a woman s you say oh dear
[1:17:23] God you imagine how the angels of God
[1:17:27] must look at such sisters they may laugh
[1:17:30] at you and make fun of you but remember
[1:17:33] you're wearing a
[1:17:35] crown you're wearing a
[1:17:38] crown for Jesus
[1:17:41] Christ now watch in verse
[1:17:43] 13 Paul says judging yourselves is it
[1:17:48] comely that a woman pray unto God
[1:17:52] uncovered does not even nature itself
[1:17:54] self teach
[1:17:56] you that if a man have long
[1:17:59] hair it is a shame unto him but if a
[1:18:03] woman have long hair well brother Donnie
[1:18:07] how long is
[1:18:09] long well let's look at the word that
[1:18:11] Paul used to define
[1:18:13] long to let the hair
[1:18:18] grow there's some sisters in our church
[1:18:21] I've known them for years and years
[1:18:23] their hairs never got packed just about
[1:18:25] here some of them right at the top of
[1:18:26] their shoulders it ain't CA they cut it
[1:18:29] it just won't
[1:18:30] grow and there's some that have it down
[1:18:33] here ericus was way down
[1:18:37] here some of it touch the ground I've
[1:18:40] seen them with theirs where they
[1:18:41] couldn't even it would actually go down
[1:18:43] and touch the ground and lay a few
[1:18:45] inches past their heels on their on
[1:18:47] their feet CU it was so
[1:18:50] long but yet the sister whose hair is
[1:18:52] only this long if it's uncut hair it
[1:18:54] meets God's requirement the African
[1:18:57] sisters in sub Sahara whose hair is not
[1:18:59] any longer than mine is yet they meet
[1:19:02] God's
[1:19:04] requirement praise the Lord but if a
[1:19:07] woman have long hair it is a say it with
[1:19:13] me
[1:19:14] glory to her for her hair is given her
[1:19:21] for a
[1:19:23] covering now you'll see see a branch of
[1:19:26] the
[1:19:27] menites some of the Amish some of the
[1:19:31] Hutterites some of the different ones
[1:19:33] even used to years ago some of the
[1:19:35] nazarin some of the
[1:19:37] Holiness that uh I used to preach for
[1:19:40] years ago some of them women you'll see
[1:19:42] them and they'll have the little thing
[1:19:44] on their head and their preachers
[1:19:46] ministers whatever they wish to call
[1:19:48] them teach them that they must have a
[1:19:50] covering and I agree
[1:19:53] 100%
[1:19:55] but it's not a piece of
[1:19:58] cloth it's their
[1:20:00] hair if they believe the
[1:20:04] Bible now notice if a woman have long
[1:20:07] hair it is a glory to her for her hair
[1:20:12] her hair is given to her for a covering
[1:20:17] look at this word vesture a covering
[1:20:21] thrown
[1:20:23] around a
[1:20:26] wrapper a
[1:20:28] mantle a
[1:20:31] veil here is the mantle I believe in
[1:20:34] here is the wrapper so you sisters that
[1:20:38] God has given you and your jeans and
[1:20:40] your DNA and all that is made to wear as
[1:20:43] my wife sitting here tonight draped with
[1:20:45] her hair pretty curls on the bottom
[1:20:48] draped around what is it it's a rapper
[1:20:50] look everybody look at her she'll pass
[1:20:52] out when you do but look at her look at
[1:20:54] her look at look at her hair dra draped
[1:20:56] around it is a wrapper she don't need a
[1:21:00] black cloth or some other kind of cloth
[1:21:02] to wrapper head God gave her her
[1:21:05] covering God Gave You sisters your
[1:21:08] covering it is your glory praise the
[1:21:12] Lord a covering thrown around a wrapper
[1:21:18] a mantle a veil praise the Lord Jesus so
[1:21:24] it is an actual adornment an Adorn an
[1:21:28] adorning that God would give to the
[1:21:31] woman and where does it come from from
[1:21:33] nature so it comes from nature so a
[1:21:36] woman's long hair was then and is now
[1:21:40] the woman's glory and given to her as a
[1:21:44] visible expression of the
[1:21:47] differentiation between male and female
[1:21:51] Sexes so you'd be able to look at him
[1:21:54] and one
[1:21:55] and let's just all be honest with one
[1:21:56] another you look at things today things
[1:22:00] you know I'm not sure what to call them
[1:22:01] exactly and you're not sure if it's a
[1:22:04] him or a her or a Shem or a sham or a
[1:22:06] grim or a Graham or a you you you don't
[1:22:09] know what they even are you know I mean
[1:22:11] they're passing laws in States I just
[1:22:13] read of some this week and if you use
[1:22:15] the wrong pronoun that person can
[1:22:18] actually bring you before
[1:22:20] court in Canada it's already there you
[1:22:23] can get prison
[1:22:26] terms that's just right north of us what
[1:22:30] a terrible time we're living in so can
[1:22:32] you imagine preachers that are
[1:22:34] compromisers no longer will be able to
[1:22:37] read and preach what I preach to you
[1:22:40] tonight from the Bible and I'm sure
[1:22:43] you've noticed already I've not been
[1:22:45] bringing you quotes in these question
[1:22:46] answers we believe the Bible in our
[1:22:49] church we believe the message too is
[1:22:51] that right but I want you when people
[1:22:54] ask SK at work and this and that you can
[1:22:57] take them to the Bible cuz they're not
[1:22:58] going to be interested in quotes from
[1:22:59] brother brandom I want you to be able to
[1:23:02] have a scriptural answer that is our
[1:23:05] foundation we can talk the message among
[1:23:07] ourselves we can share quotes with one
[1:23:10] another among ourselves but what good
[1:23:12] does that do to people out here but we
[1:23:14] want to be able to have an answer from
[1:23:16] God's Bible praise the Lord I like it
[1:23:20] that way myself don't you all right now
[1:23:23] before I go to this next one anybody
[1:23:25] else have a question I'm going to step
[1:23:27] out a little bit here anybody else have
[1:23:28] a question about this before I leave
[1:23:33] it well praise the Lord I'm almost done
[1:23:36] pretty good with it you all right thank
[1:23:37] you Jesus please explain Psalm 100 verse
[1:23:43] one a Psalm of
[1:23:46] Praise Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord
[1:23:52] All Ye Lands
[1:23:56] now I'm not sure exactly whoever the
[1:23:58] person is because I think brother Rob
[1:24:00] might have given me this one I don't
[1:24:01] remember but there was no name which is
[1:24:03] not necessary I'm not sure exactly the
[1:24:06] point of the question but I wanted to uh
[1:24:11] go to this part about the Joyful Noise
[1:24:13] so a Psalm of Praise Make a Joyful Noise
[1:24:17] unto the Lord now some of us that's the
[1:24:18] only thing we can do because we can't
[1:24:20] sing very good and you know we just do
[1:24:22] the best we can but I want you to listen
[1:24:24] to the the meaning of this word noise to
[1:24:27] shout raise a sound cry out give a
[1:24:32] blast I mean some people that's what
[1:24:34] they do in church they just blast don't
[1:24:38] they to shout a war cry wow to shout a
[1:24:44] war cry some people do that sometimes in
[1:24:45] church and it'll scare the liver out of
[1:24:47] you when they do it you ever been
[1:24:49] standing near somebody and they give out
[1:24:51] a w and I mean you just free are about
[1:24:55] pass out because you know well you know
[1:24:57] it's amazing because a lot of this fits
[1:25:00] under the meaning of
[1:25:03] noise noise you see how we can get so
[1:25:05] set in our minds and we think it can
[1:25:07] only be a certain deciel you know if you
[1:25:09] get over that oh my that's totally out
[1:25:11] of order not according to the meaning of
[1:25:13] this word here so a shout a war cry
[1:25:16] alarm of battle to sound a signal for
[1:25:18] war or March to shout in triumph over
[1:25:22] our enemies to shout and Applause to a
[1:25:26] shout with religious impulse to shout
[1:25:29] for Joy so a Psalm of Praise Make a
[1:25:33] Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands
[1:25:37] serve the Lord with gladness come before
[1:25:40] his presence with
[1:25:44] singing Praise the Lord let's
[1:25:50] stand thank you Lord
[1:25:53] Jesus
[1:25:54] we'll ask our noisy musicians to come
[1:25:57] and our noisy song
[1:26:04] leader praise the
[1:26:07] Lord I don't know about you I love
[1:26:09] spring time because the song birds come
[1:26:13] back brother random said those song
[1:26:15] birds were His
[1:26:17] Radio I love hearing them because I
[1:26:20] think I know y'all think I'm weird
[1:26:22] probably sometimes anyway but I think
[1:26:24] what they learn that and how did they
[1:26:26] learn how did they learn that to stay on
[1:26:28] Pitch how how do they you know you just
[1:26:30] think strange things but I just love to
[1:26:32] hear them because they just whistle and
[1:26:34] whistle and sing and sing and so who
[1:26:38] does that benefit why did the Lord give
[1:26:40] them that ability for us for us to be
[1:26:45] able to enjoy it and they're singing
[1:26:47] with all of their little hearts and
[1:26:49] they're just praising and praising and
[1:26:51] praising and then they'll die down
[1:26:53] during the day I'm sure you noticed it
[1:26:55] 11 11:30 something like that they'll
[1:26:57] kind of get quiet and then in the
[1:26:59] evening when the Sun goes to set it'll
[1:27:01] pick right back up again and they go to
[1:27:03] singing and fluttering and flying around
[1:27:05] and they're getting ready to rest and
[1:27:07] Roost in the trees at night but they are
[1:27:09] making a noise to the Lord and every now
[1:27:12] and then you'll hear one that's off
[1:27:13] pitch a little bit and I laugh at him
[1:27:15] because I think well that's old like me
[1:27:16] you know and he he you know you got
[1:27:18] these and boy they're just harmonizing
[1:27:20] and they're doing
[1:27:21] this but he's making a Joyful Noise was
[1:27:24] to the
[1:27:25] Lord oh my don't you just want to do
[1:27:28] that to
[1:27:29] Jesus Hallelujah let's just bow our
[1:27:34] heads heavenly father thank you for this
[1:27:37] time that we could be together tonight
[1:27:39] Lord I Thank you for this
[1:27:42] question I've been so excited about
[1:27:45] coming and bringing this tonight
[1:27:47] father because I felt like that it would
[1:27:50] help maybe different people that are
[1:27:53] struggling and
[1:27:54] trying to understand
[1:27:56] it I pray that it'll be one of those
[1:27:59] Monumental things that will be shared
[1:28:02] with people around the world that it'll
[1:28:05] help people to be able to understand it
[1:28:09] help our sisters to
[1:28:11] realize they have not been given a
[1:28:14] position that is so
[1:28:17] worthless and they're at the bottom of
[1:28:19] the pole as we would
[1:28:21] say that they have been given a glorious
[1:28:26] position she was taken out of
[1:28:29] man but yet you in turn you use her to
[1:28:34] Crown
[1:28:35] man and you gave her the ability not man
[1:28:39] the ability to grow
[1:28:41] hair down past their
[1:28:43] knees down to the
[1:28:46] ground and be so long and so
[1:28:49] beautiful and then you would identify
[1:28:51] that as her
[1:28:53] crown and you father would say that she
[1:28:56] was the glory of the
[1:28:59] man and you would turn around and say
[1:29:01] that we as your
[1:29:04] church are your
[1:29:07] crown I can't say I fully understand all
[1:29:10] of
[1:29:11] that how could me a flawed human
[1:29:14] being ever be a crown to the Lord
[1:29:18] Jesus but I believe your word
[1:29:21] Lord I pray you'd help each Young man
[1:29:24] each single man each married
[1:29:26] man help us as the men of the message
[1:29:31] the young men of the message to desire
[1:29:34] that our lives can be more subjected to
[1:29:37] you some of the brothers here tonight
[1:29:39] are married others aren't yet maybe
[1:29:41] they're looking for a young lady to be
[1:29:43] their wife some of them are too young
[1:29:45] for it yet but eventually they will but
[1:29:48] may they take these things to Heart
[1:29:50] tonight and see
[1:29:51] wow if I really want to to marry a
[1:29:54] daughter of God then I I need to be the
[1:29:57] right Son of God help them to realize
[1:30:01] that they need to have their life
[1:30:02] subject to you so their wives that want
[1:30:06] to be subject to
[1:30:07] them and it's amazing that with each
[1:30:10] subjection that there is in the Divine
[1:30:13] protocol of
[1:30:15] God that you will
[1:30:17] honor the subjected one with great
[1:30:22] Glory so the wives are to be subject to
[1:30:26] their husbands and with that subjection
[1:30:29] they receive an honor and a
[1:30:32] glory that the man does not
[1:30:35] receive the man's hair is not a
[1:30:38] glory the man's hair is not even called
[1:30:41] a
[1:30:42] crown but the wives subject themselves
[1:30:45] and they bear that and you turn around
[1:30:48] and bring glory to them then we as your
[1:30:52] human servants on the Earth
[1:30:54] we subject Our Lives to your word we
[1:30:57] give up this we quit this we don't go
[1:30:59] there we don't say this we do all these
[1:31:01] dos and
[1:31:02] don'ts and then what do you do you turn
[1:31:06] around and say because of that I will
[1:31:11] make you my crowning
[1:31:14] Glory because of your subjection and
[1:31:18] your submission to my word and my call I
[1:31:21] will not let the Angels Crown me on that
[1:31:24] that day but I will allow you my wife my
[1:31:30] bride
[1:31:32] Hallelujah Lord even in the scriptures
[1:31:35] pertaining to the resurrection that Paul
[1:31:39] wrote when he wrote about that second
[1:31:42] resurrection and he said then shall be
[1:31:45] brought to pass the saying that death is
[1:31:48] swallowed up in
[1:31:51] Victory and yet you yourself did not
[1:31:54] completely fulfill that
[1:31:56] verse that verse was
[1:31:59] left for your
[1:32:01] bride so you Crown us with such
[1:32:06] Glory oh Jesus thank you tonight
[1:32:09] father then we don't want to just wait
[1:32:12] till we get to heaven to give you glory
[1:32:14] and praise we want to give it to you
[1:32:17] now so every principle of God every
[1:32:21] promise of God that we obey and submit
[1:32:24] ourselves to and we may struggle with
[1:32:26] some of them for a while and finally we
[1:32:28] just accept them and say Here I Am Lord
[1:32:31] help me we are giving you glory and our
[1:32:35] submission brings an element of Glory
[1:32:38] back to our
[1:32:40] lives then really the way we look at
[1:32:44] it the more we give up the more Glory we
[1:32:48] have thank you Jesus who are we that the
[1:32:52] almighty God
[1:32:54] would beckon to each of us tonight come
[1:32:58] and walk with
[1:32:59] me give up this and that in the other
[1:33:02] and I promise you for everything you
[1:33:05] give up I'll give you so much more and
[1:33:10] return
[1:33:12] Hallelujah We Worship You
[1:33:15] Jesus we give you praise tonight father
[1:33:19] if there's a young man or a young woman
[1:33:21] here tonight who's not suren rered
[1:33:24] everything they
[1:33:26] are maybe what I've talked to them
[1:33:28] tonight
[1:33:30] about they believe it because it's the
[1:33:32] word but they've not yet entered into it
[1:33:36] they've not yet found that
[1:33:38] transfer of subjecting to the word
[1:33:42] brings great
[1:33:44] power it's not how much we retain that
[1:33:48] gives us power but the more we give
[1:33:51] away the more power we give
[1:33:55] back I don't know how to explain it to
[1:33:57] them Lord other than just
[1:34:00] saying sometimes the weaker I get in In
[1:34:04] the Flesh and the more people I pray
[1:34:07] for and Lord if I'm really studying hard
[1:34:10] and I've got a lot of interviews and
[1:34:13] counseling people around the world and
[1:34:16] it's just pulling on me and pulling on
[1:34:18] me and sometimes Carol knows it's a
[1:34:20] truth I have so much counseling and
[1:34:22] talking that my throat is so sore I can
[1:34:25] hardly
[1:34:28] swallow and yet I'll come back and I'll
[1:34:31] preach again and I'll reach some of the
[1:34:33] weakest moments of my life and I feel my
[1:34:36] strength is getting
[1:34:37] away and I've noticed it that when I get
[1:34:41] weaker you get
[1:34:44] stronger and you'll
[1:34:47] come and you're showing us Jesus the
[1:34:50] more we get out of the way the greater
[1:34:53] you you
[1:34:55] are if there's anyone here tonight
[1:34:57] that's that way
[1:34:59] father they reserves certain things
[1:35:02] about their life and they've not given
[1:35:03] them
[1:35:05] up because the more we give away the
[1:35:08] more vulnerable we feel but if we could
[1:35:11] only get it right in our minds the more
[1:35:13] we give
[1:35:14] away the more we're endued with power
[1:35:17] from on
[1:35:19] high thank you Lord
[1:35:21] Jesus Oh Holy Spirit spirit of God come
[1:35:24] in this place
[1:35:26] tonight may you walk up and down these
[1:35:29] aisles Lord God I noticed a while ago
[1:35:32] when I was talking about your
[1:35:34] angels that I felt that Supernatural
[1:35:38] presence you was given witness to me
[1:35:41] Lord that the angels of God was right

[1:38:44] all all to the my
[1:38:50] blessed
[1:38:52] savior
[1:38:54] I
[1:38:57] surrender
[1:39:00] all amen do you enjoy that tonight let's
[1:39:04] give the Lord a
[1:39:05] hand
[1:39:11] am you can you can look at that in two
[1:39:14] ways you can look like look at it you
[1:39:17] know I have to I have to have long hair
[1:39:19] I have to dress this way I have to do
[1:39:22] that or you can look at it
[1:39:24] as I am the
[1:39:27] glory God has given me that place to be
[1:39:29] the glory and that's what he's given his
[1:39:31] bride he's given his bride this is your
[1:39:34] place to be the glory I I really love
[1:39:37] that and to me I when you look at the
[1:39:40] difference of Law and Grace you know a
[1:39:42] lot of people think you know this law
[1:39:45] condemns you and Grace they go either so
[1:39:48] far one way legalism this way or Grace
[1:39:51] once saved always saved you can do
[1:39:52] whatever you want but if you apply Grace
[1:39:55] like God intended it you will love the
[1:39:58] law you'll love the law because they're
[1:40:02] they're they're perfectly parallel with
[1:40:04] each other they go together the law and
[1:40:06] the grace have been
[1:40:08] married so it's it's not I I have to
[1:40:11] it's I get to Grace says I get to wear
[1:40:14] my hair long Grace says I I get to wear
[1:40:17] modest
[1:40:19] clothes that's what I love about there's
