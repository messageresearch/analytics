[7:27] Department way before I came over to

[7:33] appointments prior to that before with
[7:36] another specialist and had gone through
[7:38] various procedures and Mr eyes for my
[7:42] problem I was diagnosed with prolapses
[7:46] of my pelvic floor organs and I was told
[7:50] that I needed to go for reconstructive
[7:54] surgery when I came over I came not only
[7:56] to worship attend the meetings and meet
[8:00] my pastor and his wife and to fellowship
[8:03] with all my sisters but also to be
[8:06] prayed for for healing both for Body
[8:09] Mind spirit and soul above all these is
[8:14] to meet him the Lord Jesus himself and
[8:17] to feel his awesome presence that I felt
[8:21] before I don't know brother J where you
[8:23] remember what I said to you when we
[8:24] spoke that I was afraid to go through
[8:26] the surgery and I wanted to be healed
[8:28] Naturally by the Lord
[8:30] and that I cannot return to Singapore
[8:32] without him when I went to the hospital
[8:34] today for further examinations and to
[8:36] find out more detail about the surgery
[8:39] that I would have to go through I told
[8:41] my doctor about the special meetings
[8:43] that I went to to get prayed for for my
[8:45] healing and about what happened while I
[8:48] was there when he finally got around to
[8:50] physically examining me and after doing
[8:53] all the necessary test on me he turned
[8:55] around and told me that all my organs
[8:58] have gone back to its original place and
[9:01] that I do not need any surgery at
[9:04] allall he said God has answered your
[9:08] [Applause]

[9:33] is still in shock and stunned about
[9:35] today's outcome at the doctors he was
[9:38] with me for all my medical appointments
[9:40] and I told him before I left for America
[9:42] that I was going to go and get prayed
[9:44] for for my healing and he thought I was
[9:47] crazy but I did turn around and ask him
[9:49] why do you not think that the Lord will
[9:51] heal me nevertheless my brother never
[9:54] made any more attempts to keep me from
[9:55] going instead he did his utmost best to
[9:58] help me with my trip my brother can't
[10:00] seem to wrap his head around how did my
[10:02] organs get back in place because because

[35:17] royalty and into beings that whenever we
[35:21] get there angels
[35:24] will circle the Earth while we sing
[35:28] songs of
[35:30] redemption who but Jesus could do such
[35:32] with
[35:34] trash junk
[35:37] Sinners lost wretched what a mess we
[35:41] were in you imagine you singing songs of
[35:44] redemption and Holy Angels which never
[35:48] sinned will circle the Earth and bow
[35:51] their heads while you
[35:55] sing because by experience they don't
[35:58] know anything about
[35:59] Redemption but I
[36:01] do how many is with me I do praise the
[36:06] Lord let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter
[36:09] 15 verse
[36:17] 51 somebody's having a birthday
[36:20] tomorrow and it's a u special person to
[36:25] me been a great blessing to me for many
[36:28] many
[36:29] years and has you
[36:33] too my brother
[36:45] Harry when we started out together we
[36:48] certainly would have never
[36:50] thought we would be alive this long did
[36:53] we time going on this long I'm
[36:58] 68 and I'm going go ahead and tell you
[37:00] how old he will be he'll be 64 tomorrow
[37:03] so but we're grateful that we've given
[37:06] our lives to the
[37:09] Lorden give him to him when we were
[37:11] young and used our whatever abilities
[37:14] that we would have for the kingdom of
[37:17] God and we believe that we're going to
[37:19] be together for
[37:21] eternity it's been an honor for me to be
[37:23] able to have Harry in my Ministry for
[37:28] so many many years and it's been an
[37:31] honor to be a brother but he's a double
[37:35] brother same mother and father in this
[37:37] life and same heavenly father in the
[37:40] life that is to come I love you
[37:45] Harry 1 Corinthians
[37:51] 15:51
[37:53] behold I show you a mystery
[37:59] wow I show you a mystery now what kind
[38:05] of
[38:06] man would it be that would take this
[38:09] upon
[38:10] himself to say such a
[38:13] thing behold I show you a
[38:19] mystery it's either one of two things a
[38:22] man that is a presumptuous
[38:24] liar or a man that has had a visitation
[38:28] from
[38:30] God which is what we
[38:32] believe behold I show you a mystery now
[38:37] let me share with you the meaning of the
[38:40] word
[38:42] mystery hidden
[38:44] thing
[38:46] secret
[38:48] religious
[38:50] Secrets confided only to the
[38:56] initiated and not to
[39:00] ordinary
[39:03] Mortals I've been I'm blessed by that
[39:05] meaning aren't
[39:07] you praise the Lord a hidden or secret
[39:12] thing not
[39:15] obvious to the
[39:17] understanding a hidden purpose or
[39:21] counsel secret will of men or God the
[39:26] secret councils which govern God in
[39:30] dealing with the
[39:32] righteous which are hidden from
[39:35] ungodly and wicked men but
[39:40] plain to The
[39:44] Godly well I guess we can say amen and
[39:47] go
[39:48] home that is a sermon within itself is
[39:50] it not now that you know the meaning of
[39:53] the word let me read it to you again
[39:54] behold I show you a mystery
[39:59] we shall not all
[40:01] sleep I remember 1 Corinthians is
[40:03] written around
[40:05] 5960 ad so Paul is
[40:09] still
[40:11] thinking that the Lord Jesus could come
[40:15] in his day what you notice he doesn't
[40:17] place this all in the future but he said
[40:21] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[40:24] all sleep but we shall all be
[40:29] changed so whether they're in the grave
[40:32] in the sixth Dimension their bodies
[40:34] sleeping or we're alive we shall all be
[40:40] changed now listen in a
[40:45] moment in a
[40:49] moment I love the meaning of this word
[40:52] too y'all know how I am I love
[40:54] meanings in a moment in an
[40:58] atom of
[41:01] time a point of time which can not be
[41:06] cut or
[41:08] divided it's so small and so
[41:12] fast that you couldn't even cut it in
[41:16] two in a
[41:18] moment a single
[41:21] instant
[41:23] immediately it will be
[41:25] done instantaneous
[41:28] ly glory in a moment in a twinkling of
[41:34] an eye at the last
[41:37] Trump and this is not Donald
[41:42] J at the last Trump now the word last
[41:47] here is denoting that which is the
[41:51] consummation or the closing of all
[41:54] things it's not like that it's the last
[41:57] after 27 or the last after 73 but this
[42:02] Trump is a closing it will be the end of
[42:05] the economy of this world connected with
[42:08] the last state of
[42:12] things in a moment in the twinkling of
[42:14] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[42:17] shall
[42:18] sound and the dead shall be raised
[42:22] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[42:27] for this corruptible must put on
[42:30] incorruption and this
[42:32] Mortal must put on immortality now watch
[42:35] He's dealing with the dead as we call it
[42:38] and the living this corruptible he's
[42:42] talking about those that have gone by
[42:44] the way of the Grave so when this
[42:46] corruptible shall have put on
[42:48] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[42:50] put on immortality listen to these next
[42:55] words then shall be brought to pass the
[42:59] saying that is written he's quoting from
[43:02] Isaiah now
[43:04] deaths is swallowed
[43:07] up and
[43:11] victory now I guess I guess what I'm
[43:15] trying to understand about this
[43:18] is why this would wait to be
[43:22] fulfilled in the bride's
[43:25] resurrection and not Jesus Jesus
[43:30] resurrection isn't it amazing that that
[43:32] scripture was not
[43:35] fulfilled whenever he raised from the
[43:37] dead on Easter
[43:39] morning can't you see how he's tied Us
[43:43] in with the completion of his
[43:47] victory his victory is not ultimate the
[43:51] end and reached what he wanted it to be
[43:55] until the bride has heard
[43:58] listen to this again then shall be
[44:00] brought to
[44:02] pass the
[44:05] saying that is written death is
[44:10] swallowed up in
[44:13] Victory oh
[44:16] death where is thy
[44:18] sting oh
[44:21] grave
[44:23] where is thy victory
[44:27] praise
[44:28] God and he loves him tonight with all
[44:30] your heart like to be remembered as we
[44:34] pray got a request in need we got
[44:36] several folks in the church that are
[44:38] sick Brother Brad Gilbert had heard from
[44:41] him today I'm sure brother Lou are
[44:43] requested prayer for him but he's facing
[44:45] a procedure tomorrow think he's got
[44:47] Mercy on his knees swallowed up just
[44:49] gigantic certainly needs our prayers
[44:52] let's just uh take these things before
[44:54] the
[44:55] Lord Lord Jes Jesus as I stand here
[44:58] tonight I look across this pulpit and I
[45:02] see brother Levi walls standing here
[45:04] Lord with his shoulder and this slang
[45:07] and pulled it out again the other day
[45:11] and father you see what the MRI said and
[45:15] want to get a second opinion on it again
[45:18] Lord we believe you're The God Who made
[45:21] the shoulder and the muscles and the
[45:24] tendons and the senu and all of that
[45:27] father we pray for our brother in the
[45:30] name of
[45:31] Jesus May the healing virtue of Jesus
[45:35] Christ go to our brother right
[45:38] now father we pray I didn't hear all the
[45:41] requests that Brother Louie read and
[45:43] made known but I ask you Lord that You'
[45:46] be mindful of each one of them brother
[45:49] Brad Gilbert ask me in particular if I'd
[45:51] mention it Lord about his need and Jesus
[45:54] may you extend your mercy to him moved
[45:57] him to the med center today and Father
[46:00] we pray in the name of Jesus May the
[46:02] spirit of God go to our brother other
[46:05] needs father of those that are sick and
[46:08] can't be here tonight and maybe some
[46:10] didn't really feel like coming but they
[46:12] pressed on anyway would you be mindful
[46:15] of every one of them we believe you are
[46:18] the same yesterday today and
[46:21] forever as we've gathered here tonight
[46:23] once again to feed upon the unfailing
[46:26] body word of the the son of man may you
[46:28] come in this place Lord may you help us
[46:32] open our understanding speak to us the
[46:35] word of God In The Name Of The Lord
[46:37] Jesus we ask it amen God bless you
[46:41] Saints you may be
[46:49] seated so when the Lord Jesus raised
[46:52] from the
[46:54] dead there was certainly great
[46:57] scriptures from the Old Testament and
[47:00] also the
[47:01] types that he fulfilled at his
[47:05] resurrection and yet he did not
[47:09] fulfill in the fullness this one that I
[47:13] just read
[47:14] you and
[47:16] yet brother Brenham said it over and
[47:19] over again that is one of the greatest
[47:21] events that the world had ever
[47:24] known it was great when he created in
[47:27] man it was great when he made the
[47:29] animals and the elements of the stars
[47:32] and all the botney life and all the
[47:34] divine order in the heavens and the
[47:36] divine order on the earth and all that
[47:39] was wonderful but yet when he raised
[47:42] from the dead what a great victory that
[47:45] was and yet he did not fulfill this
[47:51] scripture he kept that scripture for
[47:55] another day which would be our
[47:59] day and Paul now again I'll call your
[48:03] attention that Paul is the only author
[48:08] in the New Testament that writes about
[48:12] the order of the
[48:15] Resurrection not one of the writers of
[48:17] the four gospels not Peter and his
[48:20] Epistles not even John in the Book of
[48:22] Revelation or first second or third John
[48:27] writes and gives us the order that we
[48:30] just read about from what Paul wrote now
[48:33] remember Corinthians was wrote before
[48:35] Revelation was but God
[48:40] allocated the word the mystery form of
[48:43] what was going to be given I'll tell you
[48:45] one thing after the service here Sunday
[48:48] I have had one nuclear explosion after
[48:52] another as I've started recollecting and
[48:56] thinking of the things that the Lord
[48:58] Jesus actually never set in order
[49:02] himself about this new move called the
[49:05] church but he actually used his men
[49:09] servants that would come years later and
[49:12] they were the ones that begin to give
[49:14] the order of the church how the church
[49:17] should operate how the church should
[49:20] deal with disciplinary action in the
[49:22] body what they should do how they should
[49:25] baptize how they should should do all
[49:27] these things oh my I I I've just been
[49:30] having a time with that realizing that
[49:33] the Lord has committed so much of the
[49:37] gospel and the Mystery of the church to
[49:41] his own body in feminist form which is
[49:45] the bride now here we see the unfolding
[49:48] of the Rapture the coming of the Lord
[49:51] and the resurrection and the changing of
[49:54] the living the exact same way and you
[49:57] find you look at you saying the Lord
[49:59] Jesus never told us this order himself
[50:03] he said Luke 21:36 pray you therefore
[50:05] always that you may be accounted worthy
[50:07] to escape all these things that shall
[50:08] come to pass and stand before the son of
[50:10] man Matthew 24:24 the anointed ones in
[50:13] the last day he told us watch for his
[50:15] coming but yet he never mentioned
[50:18] nothing about a shout a voice or a
[50:23] trumpet he never mentioned nothing like
[50:26] what Paul read said to us right here in
[50:29] 1 Corinthians 15 about the corruptible
[50:32] the uncorruptible and a moment of time
[50:35] the Lord Jesus never said nothing about
[50:37] that but he committed it to his
[50:41] continuing
[50:43] Ministry through his
[50:46] sons oh praise be to God now remember in
[50:51] that Resurrection when he let out the
[50:54] loud voice from the cross
[50:58] actually the Earth went into nervous
[51:02] prostration and began to
[51:05] shake and a great earthquake happened
[51:10] now Matthew tells us in Matthew 2751 if
[51:14] you'd like to read it on down through 53
[51:16] and 54 it's very good four five verses
[51:18] there that whenever the Lord Jesus be to
[51:22] shout and scream out that there was an
[51:25] earthquake the graves open which would
[51:28] have been mainly sepers with a stone
[51:32] either laying up horizontal or vertical
[51:36] and whenever he let out this shout the
[51:40] stones were rolled away but the bodies
[51:44] didn't get
[51:45] up now people have taken
[51:49] that and they've typed
[51:52] our resurrection and our rapture in the
[51:56] last day to be the same way but you see
[52:01] God knows how to proportion his word and
[52:06] make it fit to a particular need so he
[52:10] needed living witnesses that he had
[52:15] conquered death hell and the grave but
[52:19] not only for himself but for his elect
[52:23] when he emptied out paradise
[52:27] so then Matthew goes on to say that
[52:29] after his resurrection then many of
[52:32] these saints were seen in the city now
[52:37] he wanted that to be known so Matthew
[52:40] which I again remind you that Matthew is
[52:43] the only writer in the entire Cannon of
[52:46] the New Testament that spoke about it
[52:48] which is phenomenal to me something that
[52:51] had never happened since the fall of Man
[52:54] on the earth that a resurrection of this
[52:57] magnitude had taken place and only one
[52:59] man in the New Testament wrote about it
[53:02] I just find that phenomenal but yet God
[53:05] needed living Witnesses of that first
[53:09] resurrection so then the Bible says they
[53:11] appeared in the city unto many now
[53:15] remember they had a glorified body so
[53:18] it's like they could walk right through
[53:20] that wall right there they didn't need a
[53:22] window they didn't need a door the Lord
[53:25] Jesus didn't need one
[53:27] which is exactly the way our
[53:28] Resurrection will be now remember in the
[53:32] resurrection no doubt I'll have a lot of
[53:36] visitors if I'm alive because being a
[53:39] pastor and having buried a lot of people
[53:41] and preached a lot of funerals in a lot
[53:43] of places and I got friends all over the
[53:46] world and I I I won't just have people
[53:50] my sheep that will appear to me on
[53:54] Resurrection morning but once they are
[53:57] raised from the dead they can actually
[54:01] travel like a salt well that's not a
[54:05] mystery to me cuz that's actually the
[54:08] way we got here in the first place we
[54:11] traveled as a thought from the mind of
[54:15] God when we took up our baby form body
[54:20] so we traveled as a thought and in the
[54:25] resurrection
[54:26] we will travel again like us Sal but in
[54:30] a glorified
[54:32] state so many of those then that will
[54:35] enter in the resurrection will take
[54:37] place first and then you know it won't
[54:41] be long it doesn't say exactly how long
[54:44] but it won't be long that you're going
[54:46] to be changed so once they enter into
[54:49] that glorified body they could walk
[54:51] through walls they could appear
[54:53] disappear remember they will hi have
[54:56] their ability given to them Divine
[54:59] ability to travel in dimensional travel
[55:05] which we cannot do we're limited by time
[55:09] so if I accept some of the invitations
[55:13] to Johannesburg South Africa that I'm
[55:16] getting offered and to Uganda and
[55:19] Zimbabwe and all of that I I don't dread
[55:22] the brothers and sisters I don't dread
[55:24] the meetings what I dread the most is
[55:27] that travel traveling from the US to
[55:31] Johannesburg South Africa the third
[55:34] longest flight in the world 19 and 1
[55:36] half hours on one plane why I'm limited
[55:41] by time but can you imagine when this
[55:44] happens our brothers and sisters will
[55:47] raise and they'll call their bodies from
[55:50] the dust of the earth and by seed
[55:54] they've entered into the theopen
[55:57] then they will bring that to this midair
[56:01] Dimension and meet their glorified body
[56:05] now say for instance that I have friends
[56:09] in South Africa in Kenya in Tanzania in
[56:14] China in Norway in Switzerland in
[56:18] Iceland all over the world and they
[56:22] don't once say raised from the dead they
[56:26] will be able to travel unlike anything
[56:29] that we've ever done before it would
[56:32] take me longer to get into my car
[56:34] tonight after church then they could
[56:37] make a visit in their home Church in
[56:40] Nairobi Kenya and the next thought
[56:43] they're in my bathroom with me brushing
[56:46] my
[56:48] teeth and then they decide they want to
[56:51] go to Jeffersonville cuz that's where
[56:54] they figure The Profit will be and then
[56:57] he decides he wants to go down to
[56:59] Georgia and they want to go to Illinois
[57:02] and they want to go here and it's just
[57:04] as simple as thinking about it now I
[57:07] know you're looking at me really strange
[57:09] and you think I'm from another world
[57:11] tonight don't you I am I am from another
[57:14] world I think on worldly things I'm
[57:19] waiting for travel that will be Beyond
[57:23] this world we're so limited by see taste
[57:28] feel smell hear but there is another
[57:31] world that's no more than 20 feet from
[57:34] where we are right now oh
[57:38] Hallelujah and in that world you and I
[57:41] before long will be burst
[57:44] into now watch this so the Lord needed
[57:49] live witnesses that would be able
[57:53] someone in the cities around there
[57:56] no doubt had wrote it now I've been
[57:59] there to David's
[58:02] tomb and what's amazing is that there
[58:05] were were David's uh Seer and his
[58:09] gigantic big Stone box thing that he is
[58:12] I I I found it amazing in being there a
[58:15] few years ago that that building that
[58:18] was there of course is not one of the
[58:20] original ones that would date back to
[58:22] the time of where the apostles received
[58:24] the Holy Ghost but but it was part of
[58:27] the foundational structure of that and
[58:30] the upper room where they supposedly
[58:33] receive the Holy Ghost is built on the
[58:37] site of where David's tomb was so it
[58:42] makes the scripture in the New Testament
[58:45] to where it said even as David Our
[58:47] Father which is here to this day so when
[58:50] they were in the upper room the original
[58:53] Upper Room it was like a second story
[58:56] over where David's body was laying
[59:00] downstairs so you
[59:03] imagine here they got the Holy Ghost up
[59:05] here and David God raised him from down
[59:10] there 40 days prior to that and here
[59:14] they are on the Feast of Weeks or
[59:17] Pentecost God raised David 40 days down
[59:20] on the first level God raised them 50
[59:23] days later up on the second level amen
[59:28] now you seen that all of those saints of
[59:31] God that were there and remember
[59:34] whenever job died and he said I know
[59:38] that my redeemer liveth and someday in
[59:42] the last days I will stand upon the
[59:45] Earth though my skin worms though my
[59:49] skin worms will destroy my body my flesh
[59:54] yet in my flesh I I will see
[59:59] God and joob was buried then in this
[1:00:03] certain place in a field of
[1:00:07] mpil and in there was a cave and you
[1:00:10] remember that Abraham when Sarah died
[1:00:13] that Abraham went and bought this field
[1:00:16] and according to the heran texts which
[1:00:20] was found many many years ago which
[1:00:23] dated back to during the time frame of
[1:00:27] the Hittites of the hurian law and it
[1:00:31] would have dated close to the time that
[1:00:34] Abraham was on the earth and the amount
[1:00:36] of money that Abraham paid for that
[1:00:39] field would have been
[1:00:41] astronomical it would have been
[1:00:43] unbelievable just comparing the price
[1:00:47] that he paid for that field compared to
[1:00:50] the Common Real Estate because the
[1:00:52] hurian text and what they did they made
[1:00:54] it in in a kuna form they call it and
[1:00:57] then it was there so they had
[1:00:59] transactions of selling cattle and
[1:01:01] selling property and all that sort of
[1:01:03] thing so they found it many many years
[1:01:06] ago thousands of years old and it it
[1:01:09] gave the price of a piece of property so
[1:01:12] in comparison to what Abraham paid it
[1:01:16] would have seemed as if though they set
[1:01:18] him on fire and you imagine them old
[1:01:21] hitp boys I mean they thought they went
[1:01:24] away from their life and but I I can
[1:01:27] imagine myself that when the deal was
[1:01:30] closed from that day it was Abraham that
[1:01:33] went away life him because by Revelation
[1:01:37] he knew that the resurrection was going
[1:01:39] to be in a certain place so Sarah was
[1:01:44] buried there Abraham was buried there
[1:01:48] Isaac was buried there Rebecca was
[1:01:51] buried there whenever Jacob and was down
[1:01:54] in Egypt and when every before he died
[1:01:57] he told his son swear to me upon the god
[1:02:00] of my fathers that you will not leave me
[1:02:03] down here in the land of Egypt why
[1:02:06] because the Resurrection the first
[1:02:08] resurrection was not going to be in
[1:02:11] Egypt unlike our Resurrection it will be
[1:02:16] all over the whole
[1:02:18] Earth but now remember that Resurrection
[1:02:22] was going to be it was going to be
[1:02:26] Regional you had to be in a certain spot
[1:02:30] in order to partake of it so Jacob makes
[1:02:34] his sons swear so whenever they come out
[1:02:37] of the land of Egypt here they come 430
[1:02:40] years later and they're carrying the
[1:02:43] coffin of Jacob and where do they put
[1:02:46] him they put him in heon so right there
[1:02:50] in that cave right now they have this
[1:02:52] gigantic massive building that is built
[1:02:55] over there over the the tombs of the
[1:02:59] Patriarchs now remember this is also a
[1:03:02] holy place to the Muslims which in one
[1:03:05] way it's probably a good thing or they
[1:03:07] would have destroyed it because whenever
[1:03:09] they get in and they get property where
[1:03:12] it belongs to the Jews whenever they
[1:03:14] exchanged part of their property for
[1:03:16] peace as they call it they went in and
[1:03:19] destroyed many of the ancient relics of
[1:03:22] Jewish history because they can't stand
[1:03:25] it that the Jews can trace back their
[1:03:28] history farther back than they can so
[1:03:31] whenever they got part of this stuff
[1:03:33] they went in there and dug it up and
[1:03:35] destroyed it but because they rever and
[1:03:39] look at Abraham now they are the ones
[1:03:42] actually for many years that watched
[1:03:44] over this tomb I hate to be the breaker
[1:03:47] of bad news but Abraham ain't there
[1:03:51] Sarah ain't there Isaac and Rebecca they
[1:03:54] ain't there they done had a
[1:03:56] resurrection you see it was them so in
[1:04:01] that day their Resurrection would answer
[1:04:05] according to the need of the hour and
[1:04:09] God wanted it to be visible but alas
[1:04:13] ours is totally different now will the
[1:04:18] dead raise they will but will there be
[1:04:22] empty Graves all over the Earth so so
[1:04:26] well I walk out to the graveyard and
[1:04:29] I'll I'll walk into the Happy Valley
[1:04:31] Memorial there I buried many of our
[1:04:34] Saints right there well I'll walk up on
[1:04:37] the hill second tier up and find brother
[1:04:40] and sister stamper's grave open well
[1:04:44] I'll walk down and see brother Jim and
[1:04:46] see Erica's grave open no I will not I
[1:04:52] will not go on the back and find this
[1:04:54] one and that one of many many that I can
[1:04:57] name our
[1:04:59] Resurrection is not to be that way ours
[1:05:03] is to be a secret so in order for it to
[1:05:08] be a secret then he will make our
[1:05:12] Resurrection match the need of the day
[1:05:16] everybody with me now what's this and
[1:05:19] God hiding himself in Simplicity the
[1:05:22] Rapture will come in such a simple way
[1:05:24] till the judgment will fall and they'll
[1:05:27] see the son of man and they'll say
[1:05:30] wasn't we supposed to have such and such
[1:05:32] wasn't there to be an Elias sent to us
[1:05:35] and wasn't there supposed to be a
[1:05:36] Rapture and Jesus will say it's already
[1:05:40] happened and you didn't know it God in
[1:05:44] Simplicity now remember that in that day
[1:05:48] it was to be written that God give the
[1:05:51] type of course out of Ezekiel whenever
[1:05:54] he said that he would raise the their
[1:05:55] dead bodies and he was speaking about
[1:05:58] the resurrection of the nation but also
[1:06:00] he was going to have a time that he
[1:06:02] would call their bodies from the dust of
[1:06:04] the earth notice again the Rapture
[1:06:07] there'll be so few that'll go in that
[1:06:09] bride now see how the teachers has got
[1:06:11] it they've got charts and they show 10
[1:06:14] million people coming up here and all
[1:06:17] the Methodist if it's a Methodist
[1:06:18] preacher if it's a Pentecostal all the
[1:06:21] Pentecostals coming it'll never touch it
[1:06:25] it'll be maybe
[1:06:28] listen
[1:06:31] one leave
[1:06:36] Jeffersonville now you see God and His
[1:06:39] prophets and sometimes just his
[1:06:42] preachers will say things in such a way
[1:06:46] to kind of put us on
[1:06:48] edge and make us a little bit
[1:06:52] nervous why cuz we're still living in
[1:06:55] this animal body and it gets kind of
[1:06:58] cold sometimes and it gets kind of slack
[1:07:03] sometimes can anybody say
[1:07:05] Amen any of y'all ever get spiritually
[1:07:08] lazy you ever get you know where you
[1:07:11] just don't you know it's not like you're
[1:07:12] cussing out running around getting drunk
[1:07:14] all that sort of thing but you get just
[1:07:16] get so busy with life and it's so it's
[1:07:19] so much easier to just put the spiritual
[1:07:22] things off and give everything that we
[1:07:24] are to work and everything that we are
[1:07:27] to business and everything we are to
[1:07:29] everything else and then we give the
[1:07:30] Lord The Leftovers so notice how he says
[1:07:34] this that there'll maybe be one one
[1:07:38] that'll leave Jeffersonville just
[1:07:40] somebody come up missing they'll say
[1:07:44] well the rest of them won't know
[1:07:46] there'll be one leave Georgia or there
[1:07:50] be one leave in Africa and let's say
[1:07:54] there' be 500 people living that will go
[1:07:59] in the
[1:08:00] translation now that ain't the church
[1:08:03] body this is the bride that ain't the
[1:08:05] church this is the bride the church will
[1:08:08] come up by the thousands but that's in
[1:08:11] the next Resurrection they live not for
[1:08:13] the space of a thousand years see but if
[1:08:17] a bride if 500 people left the Earth
[1:08:21] this very
[1:08:23] minute the world would know nothing
[1:08:27] about
[1:08:29] it brother Donnie
[1:08:33] 500 you mean that's
[1:08:35] all and I remember the
[1:08:39] message as far as the revelation after
[1:08:42] the seals the seals this is when he's
[1:08:44] preaching it it's just starting after
[1:08:47] the Revelation is starting to open up in
[1:08:50] its
[1:08:50] fullness so the message is not just the
[1:08:55] healing it he says it's not when the
[1:08:58] seventh angel first started out but when
[1:09:01] the message started the message the
[1:09:04] message it's just starting to break
[1:09:07] whenever these seals are coming forth oh
[1:09:10] sure there's all kinds of things preach
[1:09:11] in the 50s absolutely tremendous
[1:09:14] wonderful things but now the Mysteries
[1:09:16] are coming open in the book remember who
[1:09:20] it is it's Christ himself so things are
[1:09:23] going to be said that had never been
[1:09:26] said before now he said Jesus said
[1:09:30] there'll be one in the bed I'll take one
[1:09:32] and leave one that's at nighttime
[1:09:35] there'll be two in the field on the
[1:09:38] other side of the earth I'll take one
[1:09:41] and leave one as it was in the days of
[1:09:44] Noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[1:09:47] son of man so say it would be nighttime
[1:09:50] here and it might be daytime in Africa
[1:09:54] or in New Zealand as you cross the
[1:09:57] international dat line it would be a
[1:09:59] different time so the Lord Jesus in
[1:10:03] saying this but he still leaves it in
[1:10:06] Parable form think everything will move
[1:10:09] just as
[1:10:11] common as it can be now remember the
[1:10:15] resurrection will take
[1:10:18] place theophanies by the thousands or
[1:10:23] Millions will be released from the sixth
[1:10:27] Dimension dust bodies will be called
[1:10:31] from the Earth by the
[1:10:35] millions living Saints will gradually
[1:10:39] get in the cycle and be caught
[1:10:43] up by thousands or tens of thousands or
[1:10:47] whatever it is and the world will go
[1:10:51] right on they'll get up they'll go to
[1:10:54] work they'll check their news they'll
[1:10:57] check their phone they'll continue right
[1:11:00] on with the same old thing and it will
[1:11:03] be such a small minority in compared to
[1:11:08] the billions of people that live on the
[1:11:10] earth hardly nobody will know the
[1:11:15] difference well you say brother Donnie
[1:11:18] if that's true there's no need for me to
[1:11:21] even try well if that's the way you
[1:11:23] feels it shows there's something wrong
[1:11:25] with your experience with God you need
[1:11:28] to have the type of relationship with
[1:11:31] the Lord that if we knew there was only
[1:11:35] five leaving out of Word of Life Church
[1:11:39] that you know one of them five is going
[1:11:42] to be you now you say I don't know who
[1:11:45] them other four are but I know one thing
[1:11:48] I have passed from Death unto life I'm
[1:11:51] not the person I was I love the Lord
[1:11:54] Jesus I believe his word now come on
[1:11:56] children if you don't feel that way it's
[1:11:59] time you got to pray it because you need
[1:12:03] to be so sure about where you stand with
[1:12:06] God that even when you hear these
[1:12:09] serious types of sermons that it does
[1:12:12] not scare you to death oh sure when I
[1:12:15] hear them I look too and I think Lord is
[1:12:17] there anything there is there anything
[1:12:19] there I don't worry about missing the
[1:12:22] Rapture I'm part of what's going on
[1:12:25] right now the Rapture is only another
[1:12:29] step of where I am this very night Enoch
[1:12:33] walked with God day by day by day by day
[1:12:38] he wasn't backslid the day before the
[1:12:41] Rapture and then five minutes before the
[1:12:43] Rapture he made this right and made that
[1:12:45] right and made that right and made that
[1:12:47] right and he lived like the world and
[1:12:49] acted like the world absolutely not he
[1:12:52] lived every day as if though it would be
[1:12:55] his life day the real bride of Jesus
[1:12:58] Christ is living every day so that if
[1:13:02] the Lord Jesus comes or if he calls them
[1:13:06] from the earth before the sun sets
[1:13:08] tonight that we can be ready and I think
[1:13:11] we ought to be to live as if though this
[1:13:14] could be our last day on
[1:13:16] Earth and the church
[1:13:19] said notice everything will move just as
[1:13:23] common as it can be a
[1:13:27] fanatic
[1:13:28] message will go by uhuh a fanatic
[1:13:34] message will go by and the first thing
[1:13:37] you know this Minister was going
[1:13:40] somewhere and he never come back he
[1:13:44] probably went into the woods hunting
[1:13:46] never returned no more and this fellow
[1:13:48] went somewhere you know what happened I
[1:13:50] believe that young girl she must have
[1:13:52] been caught away somewhere you know
[1:13:53] somebody take that girl out and ravish
[1:13:56] her probably throw her in the
[1:14:00] river now this happens every day there
[1:14:03] are people who come up missing on the
[1:14:06] Earth every day all you've got to do is
[1:14:09] go to the United States Post Office no
[1:14:11] matter what state you're
[1:14:12] in and you will find a board on that
[1:14:16] board is pictures names addresses dates
[1:14:20] of birth so and so been missing since
[1:14:24] whatever it was life seen so and so
[1:14:26] Justin so and so people that they can't
[1:14:30] find you imagine what the Rapture is
[1:14:32] going to be at the post office that'll
[1:14:36] be my picture in a few
[1:14:38] days that'll be your picture in a few
[1:14:40] days anybody seen Harry Reagan just had
[1:14:43] a birthday the other day Paul God did
[1:14:45] him hard hard to get to enjoy 64 at all
[1:14:48] he's much happier being under 20 than he
[1:14:50] will be a 64 I can guarantee you that it
[1:14:53] will be so comp common that they'll
[1:14:56] simply just add more pictures on the
[1:14:59] wall of the post
[1:15:01] office except for the message people who
[1:15:05] sat around the
[1:15:08] message and never really lived it never
[1:15:11] applied it to their lives they played

[1:17:35] that there is election involved in the
[1:17:38] Rapture there is predestination involved
[1:17:41] in the Rapture but I'll tell you one
[1:17:42] thing even if I was a lot I'd rather be
[1:17:46] going and hanging around where Abraham

[1:19:46] every day live every day a consecrated
[1:19:49] life of a son or daughter of God oh my
[1:19:52] if you're alive and well and fil with
[1:19:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:19:57] token is on your soul God speaks and the
[1:20:00] same God that called you out of that
[1:20:03] world that same God oh Hallelujah you
[1:20:06] will How Will I Know How will I know it
[1:20:08] was the same voice that called you my
[1:20:10] brother sister when you was in a world
[1:20:12] of darkness and you was in the Smite of
[1:20:15] the world and so groped in sin you
[1:20:17] thought there was no way out but
[1:20:19] something got a hold of you something
[1:20:22] spoke that same voice will speak
[1:20:27] again God just
[1:20:31] speaks and the Rapture will come it
[1:20:34] ain't going out there and the angels
[1:20:37] come down and shovel out the
[1:20:41] graves and get out an old dead carcass
[1:20:45] what is it it's morning sin to begin
[1:20:47] with but a new one made in its image God
[1:20:53] let you come to to the Earth to get your
[1:20:56] hair color your eye color your stature
[1:21:00] much of that remember when the prophet
[1:21:01] saw him beyond the curtain of time he
[1:21:03] said they were men they were women it's
[1:21:06] not like when we get to heaven it's a
[1:21:07] unisex sort of thing but the women still
[1:21:10] had long hair and they look like women
[1:21:13] and he said they were in the form and
[1:21:15] shape of women come on children God
[1:21:18] ain't a transgender God he made a male
[1:21:21] and female at the beginning that's the
[1:21:23] right idea and it's still the right idea
[1:21:25] today well Hallelujah so when we get to
[1:21:28] heaven it's still going to be the same
[1:21:30] thing the sons and the daughters of God
[1:21:33] and there you will have your hair and
[1:21:35] your skin color and all that that don't
[1:21:37] think everybody in heaven is going to be
[1:21:39] white you white people don't think
[1:21:41] everybody in Heaven's going to be black
[1:21:43] or going to be Asian or whatever more
[1:21:45] God loves
[1:21:47] variety there'll be blackheads red heads
[1:21:50] brond Heads there'll be brunette and but
[1:21:53] there won't be no gray head
[1:21:55] praise the Lord that's exactly right
[1:21:57] because grhe headed is a sign of old age
[1:22:01] oh yes but God will speak and the
[1:22:04] Rapture will come amen it will be a new
[1:22:08] one made in its likeness you know see if
[1:22:13] we have this we'll die again nobody will
[1:22:16] say the graves will open the dead will
[1:22:18] walk out that may be true but not open
[1:22:23] the way you you say
[1:22:26] open that's right it won't be like that
[1:22:30] it'll be a
[1:22:36] secret so does it matter to God where
[1:22:39] it's the same handful dust that's six
[1:22:41] foot down in a
[1:22:42] grave or a handful right off the top of
[1:22:45] the
[1:22:46] ground God didn't make man from clay six
[1:22:49] foot under but he made him from dust on
[1:22:52] top
[1:22:55] amen God didn't get a shovel to go down
[1:22:57] there and get a mic and you know grub
[1:22:58] and ho post to di I'm going to go down
[1:23:00] about 6ot deep now I'm going to get some
[1:23:02] that good old solid red clay and a
[1:23:04] little bit of that Michel P right I'm
[1:23:05] going get a little bit God just reached
[1:23:07] down by the Michael and just picked up a
[1:23:08] little bit of dust right on the face of
[1:23:10] the Earth there and he said I'm going to
[1:23:12] make me a boy I'm going to make me a son
[1:23:15] I'm going to give him a house to live in
[1:23:17] and what did God make him out of he made
[1:23:20] it him out of the Dust my father
[1:23:22] specializes in making his children 's
[1:23:24] bodies out of dust then he don't have to
[1:23:27] send Angels down there with a shoveling
[1:23:29] crew all night before the resurrection
[1:23:31] and say all right Gabriel Michael
[1:23:33] wormwood go on down and everybody go to
[1:23:35] digging them out but the Lord God will
[1:23:37] speak and the resurrection will happen
[1:23:40] Oh Glory it'll be a secret because he
[1:23:43] said he would come as a thief in the
[1:23:46] night he's already told us this Rapture
[1:23:49] then the judgments will strike the
[1:23:51] Rapture oh my the judgments will strike
[1:23:54] after towards the plague sickness and
[1:23:56] everything the people will cry for
[1:24:01] death that's right to take
[1:24:07] them you think it's hard
[1:24:12] now there's something in most of
[1:24:15] us we fight to
[1:24:18] live we'll take treatments if we're
[1:24:20] diagnosed with some type of some other
[1:24:23] and sometimes the treatments is about as
[1:24:25] bad as the disease you got we'll do
[1:24:27] whatever they tell us to do we'll take
[1:24:30] supplements we'll take this that and the
[1:24:32] other well you've got to get this shot
[1:24:34] and you've got to start running you've
[1:24:35] got to okay okay okay I want to live I
[1:24:37] want to live but can you imagine when
[1:24:39] the bride is gone it'll be so
[1:24:42] bad so bad that people will cry oh D
[1:24:48] take me take me right I don't want to
[1:24:52] live another day take me death
[1:24:55] yes
[1:24:58] sir why don't
[1:25:01] Believers believe the simple signs of
[1:25:05] his
[1:25:06] coming they're expecting all these
[1:25:09] things that spoke up by the scripture
[1:25:12] like the moon's going to go down in the
[1:25:14] middle of the Sun in the middle of the
[1:25:15] day and there's going to be all kinds of
[1:25:17] things oh if we just I've got notes for
[1:25:20] here on it just to show them what those
[1:25:21] things are we'll get into it the
[1:25:23] breaking of the seals this week anyhow
[1:25:25] there it is just where it's already
[1:25:28] passed and you didn't know it see if it
[1:25:32] is the Angel of the Lord will break them
[1:25:34] seals forth to
[1:25:37] us remember it seal with them seven
[1:25:41] mysterious
[1:25:43] Thunders now why can't people believe
[1:25:45] the simple Simplicity of a humble bunch
[1:25:48] of people the voice of the signs of God
[1:25:51] why can't they believe it just it's
[1:25:54] always been the true word of God being
[1:25:59] made Manifest this is the
[1:26:02] reason they're too
[1:26:05] smart and too
[1:26:09] educated to believe the simple
[1:26:12] form of the written
[1:26:16] word he tells us the same thing in this
[1:26:19] same message here in the days of
[1:26:23] Noah that were too smart too
[1:26:26] educated to believe the message of a
[1:26:29] simple
[1:26:30] man about building an
[1:26:34] ark and then the end results was he said
[1:26:37] this they
[1:26:39] lost their
[1:26:42] being we've all lost things before
[1:26:45] wallet glasses Keys we know how upset
[1:26:50] anything of value is when we lose
[1:26:52] it but Jesus Jesus says if a man loses
[1:26:56] his
[1:26:57] soul what would he give an
[1:27:00] exchange for his
[1:27:03] soul and there's only one way my friends
[1:27:05] that you and I will never lose our soul
[1:27:09] we must make a deposit of our soul into
[1:27:15] the hands of the only being who can keep
[1:27:18] it I cannot keep my soul you cannot keep
[1:27:22] your soul no person can keep our own
[1:27:25] soul by
[1:27:26] oursel but if we can commit our soul
[1:27:29] into the hands of the Lord Jesus it will
[1:27:32] be safe
[1:27:33] forever is that right oh my notice Lord
[1:27:38] Jesus help us they're too educated to
[1:27:42] believe the simple form of the written
[1:27:44] word they want to put their own
[1:27:46] interpretation to it oh it don't mean
[1:27:48] this and it don't mean that it don't
[1:27:51] mean that notice again in question
[1:27:53] answers the unbelievers will wonder
[1:27:56] what's happened now we break in again
[1:27:59] about a question about the resurrection
[1:28:01] what's the matter with them people where
[1:28:04] did they go oh God they'll not
[1:28:07] understand they'll not even see him but

[1:32:27] believe that they were seeing some of
[1:32:31] them let's just said they turned to get
[1:32:34] a little creamer for their
[1:32:36] coffee and they and Mom I I was
[1:32:39] saying
[1:32:41] mom
[1:32:45] mom so we go to the living room you go
[1:32:47] to the bedroom we go to the bathroom he
[1:32:48] said
[1:32:50] mom Mom where are you
[1:32:56] Dad they can't see you no more but
[1:33:00] you're getting
[1:33:02] together with the
[1:33:04] rest of the
[1:33:07] group everybody's got people they're
[1:33:09] going to hang out with this is the kind
[1:33:12] of people I want to hang out with the
[1:33:17] group oh yes we're going to be
[1:33:20] identified aren't we oh my when I preach
[1:33:22] brother Jared Phil sh Lord give me that
[1:33:24] thought about them being gathered to
[1:33:26] their people Well everybody's being
[1:33:28] gathered to their people right now
[1:33:31] that's why you see certain Sinners that
[1:33:32] like to do certain things and they hang
[1:33:34] around a group that does what they like
[1:33:37] to do and then you got another group of
[1:33:39] Sinners and they hang around this and
[1:33:40] then you got church people and they hang
[1:33:42] around this certain church group because
[1:33:44] that's what they want oh but I guarantee
[1:33:46] you one thing there's another group amen
[1:33:50] they love the Lord and they've got a
[1:33:52] group waiting for them on the other side
[1:33:53] and the Bible said that Abraham was
[1:33:56] gathered to his people and Isaac was
[1:33:59] gathered to his people and Jacob was
[1:34:02] gathered to his people and when the
[1:34:04] prophet went beyond the curtain of time
[1:34:06] the voice said you have been gathered to
[1:34:09] your people hallelujah what's going to
[1:34:12] happen in the resurrection it's going to
[1:34:15] be the largest gathering of people that
[1:34:18] has ever been known to men some have
[1:34:21] been in the sixth dimension for thousand
[1:34:23] thousands of years some have been living
[1:34:26] on this life for maybe 50 60 70 years
[1:34:29] and all of a sudden one event the spoken
[1:34:32] word of God will cause those Hallelujah
[1:34:36] to be turned loose out of that sixth
[1:34:38] Dimension and the rest of us will be
[1:34:40] changed by the power of God and it'll be
[1:34:43] the largest youth Gathering that's ever
[1:34:45] been on the Earth
[1:34:54] amen no old people
[1:34:57] welcome you talking about a youth
[1:35:00] meeting praise be to God notice they
[1:35:04] which are alive and remain to the coming
[1:35:05] of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder

[1:35:09] dead Christians don't
[1:35:14] die they're just taking a little rest
[1:35:18] that's all the Trump of God shall sound
[1:35:21] the dead and Christ shall rise first

[1:35:43] people from his church that had passed
[1:35:45] on so you're just standing there just

[1:36:18] already on right now the move for the
[1:36:21] bride is on you see the loosing of the
[1:36:24] seals and the breaking of those
[1:36:25] mysteries of God started something by
[1:36:28] the revealing of the word that has not
[1:36:30] stopped or slowed down and it will not
[1:36:32] stop until this bride is caught up in
[1:36:36] Rapture praise be to God all it wants
[1:36:39] you happen to stand and look well
[1:36:40] there's a brother you know what ain't

[1:36:52] wow so you're standing there talking to
[1:36:54] them they're looking at you maybe
[1:36:57] motioning for you and here you are
[1:36:59] you're still Immortal you're still
[1:37:01] captured in this
[1:37:03] body and you're looking at them and
[1:37:05] they're all around
[1:37:07] you and in a few
[1:37:09] minutes we'll be
[1:37:11] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:37:14] an eye and together with
[1:37:18] them be
[1:37:20] missing on Earth
[1:37:27] so you mean we're still going to be here
[1:37:31] for a
[1:37:33] bit
[1:37:35] just just not seeable to the
[1:37:41] unregenerated you talking about a time
[1:37:44] won't we have a time brother Joel Brown
[1:37:47] doing an awesome job on that Sunday oh
[1:37:49] you talking about a time so we're
[1:37:52] getting together
[1:37:54] and we're all left here for just a few
[1:37:56] minutes however long it is we're getting
[1:37:58] together with the rest of the group and
[1:38:00] we're fellowshipping and we're having a
[1:38:02] time right here on the earth we're
[1:38:04] missing but it's like we're here but not
[1:38:09] here it's because our astronaut space
[1:38:14] suit
[1:38:15] amen we have it on you see and we
[1:38:19] breathe different than the rest of the
[1:38:21] world us we see different we have our
[1:38:24] own controlled environment so when the
[1:38:27] astronauts go out into outer space you
[1:38:30] know they they don't have gravitational
[1:38:32] pull they don't have the oxygen and this
[1:38:34] and that and the other that that we have
[1:38:36] here so each one of them has to put on a
[1:38:40] certain suit that's a real child of God
[1:38:43] filled with the Holy Ghost so here we
[1:38:45] are out here on the world all the
[1:38:47] darkness all the SMUD all the filth all
[1:38:49] around them but we're walking around
[1:38:51] with with an astronaut suit on we got
[1:38:52] our own oxygen we got our own
[1:38:54] communication we've got our own thing it
[1:38:57] amazes me how that they can be able to
[1:38:59] radio out there to those that the
[1:39:01] International Space Station and those
[1:39:02] guys way out yonder I can't even get the
[1:39:05] weather on my phone in my bathroom every
[1:39:08] morning I get up and try to check the
[1:39:10] weather on my cell phone and you know
[1:39:12] can you hear me now can you hear me now
[1:39:14] I had to walk to there and Carol said
[1:39:15] this morning she said this crazy phone
[1:39:17] that beats all I ever seen can't even
[1:39:19] get the weather well it's because
[1:39:21] they've got a stronger signal than what
[1:39:23] I've got with Verizon I'm not kicking
[1:39:25] against Verizon now it's the same way
[1:39:27] with the bride of Christ every Christian
[1:39:30] has a little bit of a signal a pull from
[1:39:32] God they love the Lord oh thank God for
[1:39:34] Calvary oh Jesus I love you I love you
[1:39:36] they have a little signal but the bride
[1:39:38] has got a direct contact so even though
[1:39:41] she seemed like she's so far away in
[1:39:43] distance she's got more signal because
[1:39:46] he beams out powerful signal right down
[1:39:48] through the crost to Pentecost and comes
[1:39:50] right on down through the breaking of
[1:39:52] the word each one of the is an amplifier
[1:39:54] the signal that comes down and Shadows
[1:39:56] over the bride Soul bursts the very
[1:39:58] token of God in her and then she is his
[1:40:00] spitting image on the
[1:40:02] earth hallelujah hallelujah and when the
[1:40:05] Rapture gets ready to take place you
[1:40:08] won't get a text you won't get a wash
[1:40:10] laap you won't get a zoom or you won't
[1:40:11] get nothing like that he just speaks and
[1:40:14] all over the world it starts happening
[1:40:16] the Dead starts raise it up Hallelujah
[1:40:19] and they start appearing to the saints
[1:40:21] of God and we start getting together
[1:40:24] glory to God can you imagine you think
[1:40:26] you're under anticipation now can you
[1:40:28] imagine being surrounded as a pastor I
[1:40:31] might be surrounded by 25 or 30 or 400
[1:40:34] or 500 me standing there Immortal Carol
[1:40:36] standing there Immortal and I'm wanting
[1:40:38] to change I'm wanting to go I'm wanting
[1:40:40] to get out of here Lord I'm not a very
[1:40:41] patient guy anyway I'll be standing
[1:40:43] there come on Lord come on Lord but I
[1:40:46] know it'll happen right at the right
[1:40:48] time hallelujah amen aren't you glad
[1:40:51] remember the prophet was up there they
[1:40:53] the curtain of time when he had the
[1:40:54] translation and he reached up and
[1:40:56] touched his head and his hair was back
[1:40:59] one of these days you'll reach down and
[1:41:00] you look oh them spots are all gone them
[1:41:03] gray hairs are gone Hallelujah why
[1:41:06] because you have been tied in to the
[1:41:09] reveal word of this hour let people
[1:41:12] laugh at us let them call us crazy let
[1:41:15] them do whatever they want to do but one
[1:41:17] of these days don't come looking for me
[1:41:20] because I'll be gone I'll be a part of
[1:41:22] that resurrection and life I will have
[1:41:26] been changed by the power of
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:38] God now the first thing happens when
[1:41:41] we're
[1:41:43] resurrected the ones which are
[1:41:46] living will just still
[1:41:49] remain the resurrection will set in
[1:41:55] first the resurrection of those that are
[1:41:58] asleep there will be Awakening
[1:42:04] time those which are asleep in the dust
[1:42:06] now those that are asleep in sin cuz
[1:42:08] they sleep right on they don't wake for
[1:42:10] another thousand years but those who are
[1:42:12] sleeping in the dust will be awakened
[1:42:14] first these corruptible bodies will put
[1:42:17] on
[1:42:18] incorruption and the rapturing grace of
[1:42:20] the
[1:42:22] Lord then we'll
[1:42:24] all get
[1:42:27] together there's something about
[1:42:29] children of God and
[1:42:32] fellowship I remember Dr Bosworth told
[1:42:35] brother Brandon one time he said brother
[1:42:36] brand you know what Fellowship is he
[1:42:37] said well brother Bosworth I think I do
[1:42:39] he said it's Two Fellas and one
[1:42:43] ship but in this meeting it's going to
[1:42:46] be many
[1:42:48] fellows and their
[1:42:51] Darlings praise God
[1:42:53] God you imagine for our first
[1:42:57] time our first few moments in a
[1:43:01] glorified
[1:43:03] body every now and then when we get
[1:43:05] caught up into the presence of
[1:43:08] God and it's like the Lord opens our
[1:43:11] eyes and we can see farther than we've
[1:43:14] ever seen before we get under the
[1:43:15] channel of the anointing and we can
[1:43:18] think different I'm not explain it to
[1:43:19] you but as a preacher you get under that
[1:43:21] you're privileged by the mercy of God to
[1:43:22] get under under that and sometimes it
[1:43:24] it's it's hard hard to describe but it's
[1:43:27] like you're thinking in in a way that's
[1:43:29] beyond your thinking you're looking in a
[1:43:31] way that's beyond you're looking you're
[1:43:34] perceiving in a way that's beyond your
[1:43:36] own personal perception and you know
[1:43:37] that it is and you're there just
[1:43:40] momentarily and then you come back to
[1:43:42] yourself but can you imagine when we
[1:43:43] finally move out of these
[1:43:45] senses oh
[1:43:47] Hallelujah and we're able to see like
[1:43:50] we've never seen before we'll be able to
[1:43:53] love like we've never loved before we'll
[1:43:57] be able to
[1:43:58] experience
[1:44:00] Fellowship
[1:44:02] goodness grace mercy all the attributes
[1:44:06] of God in a way like we have never even
[1:44:10] known
[1:44:12] it and he allows us a little bit of time
[1:44:14] as we say in our modern vernacular just
[1:44:17] to kind of hang out together a little
[1:44:20] bit and y'all just kind of Fellowship a
[1:44:22] little a bit well you know it's sort of
[1:44:25] like we do after service whenever we're
[1:44:27] going to have a meal over here in a
[1:44:28] fellowship hall and we'll say now we're
[1:44:30] going to pray over the
[1:44:32] food and then y'all will be served
[1:44:35] shortly so some people go outside and
[1:44:37] they stop and talk and some people make
[1:44:39] it through on the the bigger four you're
[1:44:40] there and they stop and talk and then
[1:44:42] maybe somehow come to the door and say
[1:44:43] it's already if yall want to come
[1:44:46] on well we're having a little bit of
[1:44:49] fellowship before we sat down for the
[1:44:51] marriage supper of the L
[1:44:56] glory to God glory to God than so we're
[1:45:02] getting together and shaking one
[1:45:03] another's
[1:45:04] hands oh
[1:45:08] Jesus Lord
[1:45:12] God then we all get together then we
[1:45:14] begin to get together then we which are
[1:45:17] alive and remain shall be changed these
[1:45:20] mortal bodies will not seek death
[1:45:24] but just of a
[1:45:26] sudden there'll be like a
[1:45:31] sweep go over
[1:45:34] us now you see the
[1:45:36] bride is used to
[1:45:40] sweeping you remember the parable that
[1:45:42] Jesus
[1:45:43] gave about the woman that had the
[1:45:47] coins and she lost the coin in her house
[1:45:53] and she
[1:45:55] started ah
[1:45:58] sweeping now of course we know that it
[1:46:00] was a tablet that her husband gave her
[1:46:02] and it was several coins and she wore it
[1:46:04] up here like a crown so if she lost one
[1:46:08] of those it was a sign she was an impure
[1:46:13] woman so much of our Lives has meant
[1:46:18] sweeping so we sweep out under the bed
[1:46:21] we sweep out under the closet yeah
[1:46:23] preachers are good sweepers aren't they
[1:46:25] God uses them boy they'll get back in
[1:46:27] them Corner they got them big long
[1:46:28] brooms and them big long handles man
[1:46:30] then go in there pull out things that
[1:46:32] you didn't even know was there you say
[1:46:34] oh my good well the brides used to

[1:46:47] bride's been used to sweeping so the
[1:46:50] last thing the Lord's going to do while
[1:46:52] she's
[1:46:53] Immortal is one more
[1:46:56] sweep Oh Glory to God it'll be your last

[1:58:55] hallelujah oh
[1:58:59] Hallelujah and me say brother Donnie I
[1:59:01] want to be there oh more than anything
[1:59:03] in this world would you just raise your
[1:59:06] hand to
[1:59:07] God you know if you had a lump in your
[1:59:11] body or a mass or something another
[1:59:13] going on or maybe you couldn't feel
[1:59:15] anything or knew that something was
[1:59:18] visible protruding through your clothes
[1:59:20] and maybe the doctor say well we might
[1:59:23] need to do a scan and we might an MRI CT
[1:59:27] an x-ray or pet
[1:59:30] scan it might help them to see if
[1:59:32] there's something going
[1:59:34] on well may we as the children of God
[1:59:37] tonight not go through a CAT scan or a
[1:59:39] pet scan or an
[1:59:41] MRI but through the Great Divine Eyes Of
[1:59:44] Love Of Our
[1:59:46] Father may he look our way
[1:59:49] tonight just see if there's anything in
[1:59:52] our way that hinders
[1:59:56] us oh
[1:59:58] hallelujah praise the
[2:00:01] Lord maybe it's something that you need
[2:00:04] to make right with a brother or a sister
[2:00:06] or maybe it's just something between you
[2:00:09] and the Lord something you don't
[2:00:12] understand and it started out very small
[2:00:14] but it's built a little bit of
[2:00:15] resentment toward the will of God maybe
[2:00:18] it's toward your pastor or toward a
[2:00:21] minister
[2:00:23] friend we don't want anything in our
[2:00:25] way oh no we're too close now we want to
[2:00:30] be ready every day every
[2:00:34] hour I wonder how many with me tonight
[2:00:38] would raise our hands and say Lord
[2:00:40] remember
[2:00:41] me I'll raise my hands
[2:00:44] Jesus if there's anything Lord about my
[2:00:48] life that displeases you show me
[2:00:53] Father I've had different scans in my
[2:00:56] life Lord and they found this and found
[2:00:59] that they scanned me a few years ago and
[2:01:02] found a nodule on my lung and I asked
[2:01:05] the church to pray for me asked some
[2:01:07] preachers to pray for me and they scann
[2:01:09] me again sometime after that and it was
[2:01:14] gone so I believe prayer moved it
[2:01:16] because it was nothing they
[2:01:18] done so Lord if that can happen
[2:01:22] medically then what about in our
[2:01:25] soul our walk with
[2:01:27] God lord just may we pass under that
[2:01:32] word scan tonight see if you see
[2:01:35] anything about us are we too Vain about
[2:01:39] life are we are we proud are we
[2:01:44] arrogant anything Lord I'm not trying to
[2:01:48] put words in your mouths I'm just simply
[2:01:50] saying anything
[2:01:52] that you
[2:01:53] see search US Lord every preacher in the
[2:01:57] building the deacons the trustees the
[2:02:01] singers
[2:02:03] musicians the brothers up in the
[2:02:06] booths Lord that give their sacrifice
[2:02:11] their service time to keep the internet
[2:02:14] up and going and recording and all of
[2:02:16] that Lord I pray You' help them it's not
[2:02:20] enough just to come and be in the
[2:02:22] building may they might not be
[2:02:24] disconnected Lord but may the spirit of
[2:02:28] God I pray deal with them as
[2:02:30] well oh
[2:02:32] Jesus scan us tonight father may we pass
[2:02:36] your
[2:02:37] scan maybe come out on the other side
[2:02:40] and if there's nothing there we'll thank
[2:02:42] God for it if there is something there
[2:02:46] then we'll say praise the Lord for that
[2:02:48] too cuz you let us see it so we could
[2:02:51] fix it and make it right we love you
[2:02:54] Lord
[2:02:55] Jesus we want to please you dear God we
[2:02:59] know as long as we're in these animal
[2:03:01] bodies it'll be a
[2:03:03] contest but Lord we believe if we bring
[2:03:06] this body subject to your word by the
[2:03:09] control tower in the soul we're doing it
[2:03:12] a great favor because one day this
[2:03:15] subjection will lead it into the
[2:03:19] translation Hallelujah
[2:03:22] we worship you tonight father We Praise
[2:03:25] You Lord
[2:03:27] Jesus thank you

[2:03:48] little bit and sing a little bit to him
[2:03:51] before we go if you need to go of course

[2:03:58] together in his
[2:04:00] presence I love to spend time by myself
[2:04:03] with the Lord and I do that but I have
[2:04:06] to say there's something very special
[2:04:09] about being with other children of God
[2:04:11] too it's why special meetings we call
[2:04:14] them special meetings because they are
[2:04:16] special of course so there's something
[2:04:19] about us being together with our
[2:04:21] brothers and sisters in the house of God
[2:04:24] so let's take advantage of this
[2:04:27] opportunity here
