[38:19] type of church but God's
[38:21] grace God's
[38:23] grace amen I'm so grateful for it Joel 2
[38:28] verse
[38:30] 23 Joel 2 verse 23 and then we'll skip
[38:34] down to verse
[38:38] 28 be glad then you children of
[38:42] Zion and
[38:44] rejoice in the Lord your
[38:47] God for he has given you the former
[38:50] Reign moderately and he will cause to
[38:54] come down for you the rain the former
[38:57] for rain and the latter rain in the
[39:00] first month verse
[39:04] 28 and it shall come to pass afterward
[39:08] that I will pour pour out of my spirit
[39:11] upon All Flesh your sons and your
[39:16] daughters shall prophesy and he believes
[39:19] in true
[39:21] prophecy amen your old men shall dream
[39:26] dreams your young men shall see
[39:30] visions and also upon the servants and
[39:35] upon the handmaids in those days while I
[39:39] pour out my
[39:41] spirit now for us that are westerners
[39:44] and having been under the influence of
[39:47] Christianity most of our
[39:49] life if you would have been a Jew when
[39:52] this was prophesied by Joel it would
[39:56] have seemed seemed like absolute
[40:00] heresy to
[40:02] you because prophets were the ones of
[40:05] Sal Visions nobody else prophets were
[40:09] the ones that had God's spirit nobody
[40:12] else so you can imagine when they heard
[40:14] this prophecy in their day and they
[40:17] thought this man was out of his
[40:21] mind prophecy is tricky you
[40:24] see prophecy has a timeline on
[40:28] it now I know that some of you have
[40:31] probably seen some of the videos that
[40:34] have been put together and um I've
[40:36] gotten several different ones in the
[40:38] last few weeks and it's been people
[40:41] charismatic preachers and different
[40:43] types of preachers that have taken the
[40:46] things that brother brandham said about
[40:49] seeing a woman either being the
[40:51] president it would be a woman president
[40:53] or the Catholic Church put it on YouTube
[40:57] and lots of people of course have seen
[40:59] it and they themselves if they didn't
[41:02] cover exactly the way he said it now you
[41:05] know what that's going to do since Cala
[41:08] was not elected yesterday as
[41:12] president the danger with prophecy is
[41:16] that it can look like
[41:19] prophecy and yet not be now if Kamala
[41:24] Harris would have been voted in by the
[41:26] people of the United States it still
[41:29] would not mean she was the woman the
[41:32] prophet saw that's right right so it has
[41:37] to be the right person the right time so
[41:41] whenever we look at Joel's prophecy it
[41:44] was exactly the same way and yet the
[41:47] Fulfillment of it they probably looked
[41:49] for it for years and years but a man
[41:51] anointed by the Holy Ghost for the
[41:54] season when it fell said
[41:57] this is
[42:00] that that was spoken by the prophet Joel
[42:04] so sometimes we look at prophecy and
[42:06] we're thinking is this it is that it
[42:09] could that be it could that be it could
[42:10] that be it I don't mind telling you some
[42:12] message preachers put some things
[42:14] together a while back and I mean just by
[42:19] reading it on a couple of chats that I'm
[42:21] on I thought woo better be careful your
[42:24] brother you're going to get you're going
[42:26] to get in hornet nest here you're going
[42:29] to lay it out here to where if you're
[42:30] not careful you're going to get yourself
[42:32] hemmed up in a
[42:33] box that's why you don't hear me doing
[42:36] that ignorant stuff if God's Prophet
[42:39] didn't know whether or not as a woman or
[42:40] a church who are we that we think we do
[42:45] come
[42:47] on come on
[42:52] now so the best thing for us to do is
[42:55] just say Lord help me to find what's
[42:58] going on where the time is
[43:00] what's
[43:03] right I'm so glad that we can have that
[43:05] attitude I me like to be remembered
[43:07] tonight as we
[43:09] pray have a prayer call here for our
[43:13] brother Tyler I see him back there in
[43:15] the back tonight he had some needs he
[43:17] wanted us to to remember him for also I
[43:20] heard from Brother Wade and sister Anna
[43:23] altland today and they're in the need of
[43:25] prayer we have several of course in our
[43:27] church family that's fighting some real
[43:30] tough times right now sickness and
[43:32] things let's just remember them and take
[43:34] them before the Lord
[43:36] today Heavenly Father we count it oh
[43:39] once again such a great honor that we
[43:42] can be here on Wednesday night what a
[43:46] privilege how we love church on
[43:49] Wednesday night it just seems like it's
[43:51] such a boost for us Lord to help us I'm
[43:55] so glad that we don't have to go just
[43:58] from Sunday to Sunday I know there's
[44:00] churches all over the world and that's
[44:04] that's the only time they can get
[44:05] buildings and so on but I'm so grateful
[44:09] that we can have a midweek service lord
[44:12] it's just like another Holy Ghost Shop
[44:14] full of Holy Ghost steroids for us we
[44:17] just love coming together and singing
[44:20] and praising and praying and hearing
[44:22] your word thank you for it Lord I pray
[44:25] it never becomes common place to us Lord
[44:29] Jesus now as we approach you father
[44:31] we're asking for the needs among your
[44:34] children all the requests that was
[44:37] signified by the raising of a hand and
[44:40] we pray father that you would just help
[44:42] each one we have several in our church
[44:45] Lord that's dealing with some real
[44:48] difficult times right now we pray that
[44:50] you'd be mindful of them father I pray
[44:52] for brother Wade and sister Anna Lord
[44:54] that's so looking forward to being
[44:56] church tonight dear God that just things
[44:58] worked out to where they couldn't be but
[45:01] we pray that you'd be mindful of them
[45:02] this prayer cloth that I have in my hand
[45:04] tonight father from my young brother I
[45:07] pray that you'd minister to him Lord
[45:10] dear God help me tonight as I try to
[45:13] bring forth the word what you placed
[45:16] upon my heart today Lord help me to get
[45:18] out of the way Lord we we realize that
[45:22] our nation has come through a a very
[45:26] difficult time time a time of great
[45:29] Division and a lot of trauma and a lot
[45:33] of things that's that's went on and Lord
[45:36] I know that no matter how an election
[45:40] goes there's always going to be people
[45:43] disappointed but Lord I pray there may
[45:46] be people that we would differ with as
[45:48] far as our political views and all that
[45:51] but Lord I happen to know of an
[45:54] individual that at the last presidential
[46:00] election his wife got so
[46:03] distraught because it didn't go the way
[46:05] she thought it would and
[46:08] should and she got under such stress and
[46:12] such
[46:13] pressure that she wind up taking her
[46:16] life so Lord some of our fellow
[46:20] Americans tonight they're crying they're
[46:23] sad oh we may laugh at them cuz we're of
[46:26] the opposite party but they're still
[46:30] part of our nation
[46:31] Lord so I pray you'd help them because I
[46:34] realize Satan loves these opportunities
[46:37] to make people so despondent that they
[46:40] just take their life we know it don't
[46:43] make no difference who's in there anyway
[46:44] as far as being peace and bringing all
[46:47] that to the Earth there's only one that
[46:49] can do that and that's you but Lord
[46:52] however long that we can live here and
[46:55] have peace we certainly desire it
[46:57] but be mindful of us Lord God help us
[47:00] not to bring politics so into our lives
[47:04] and into our church that we don't even
[47:06] speak to one another because we're of a
[47:08] different political party and we can see
[47:11] it happening inside our message ranks
[47:14] not So Much by politics but by division
[47:17] of doctrinal issues help us I pray
[47:21] father will we ever grow up it's no
[47:23] wonder the Rapture hasn't come yet Lord
[47:27] it's a it's evident we've not grown up
[47:30] enough we're still fighting like
[47:32] children fighting like babies but help
[47:36] us I pray father speak to us your word
[47:39] may we have an element tonight Lord
[47:42] where we can grow as we hear your word
[47:45] father in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[47:49] the Saints said amen God bless you you
[47:52] may be
[47:53] seated now just in case tonight some of
[47:56] y'all are Wonder wondering did I vote
[47:59] Yes I did and let me tell you how I
[48:04] voted because it was a
[48:08] three-way
[48:10] election that I voted in the prophet
[48:14] describes it this way God voted for me
[48:19] the devil voted against me and the
[48:24] outcome will depend upon which way I
[48:27] voted come on so you know who I voted
[48:30] for almighty God Amen so that way I win
[48:34] in every election it don't really
[48:37] matter thank you Lord aren't you glad
[48:40] that we're part of that
[48:42] tonight let us go immediately now into
[48:46] the resume of the church ages from the
[48:49] church age
[48:50] book page
[48:52] 377 and let's resume on what we've been
[48:56] looking about on the the latter rain the
[48:59] former and the latter rain truly this is
[49:03] part of the prophecy of this hour where
[49:06] we're living you know it's sort of like
[49:09] if you go into a mall and you could go
[49:11] this way or that way or that way or and
[49:14] and you don't know where where you're
[49:16] going um most generally when you walk in
[49:19] an entrance whether it's on the east
[49:21] side the West Side the north side South
[49:23] Side whatever it is whenever you walk
[49:25] into that and they're going to have this
[49:27] large kios type of thing there one of
[49:29] the first things that they're going to
[49:31] identify is you are here so you are here
[49:38] in front of Kirklands in front of you
[49:40] know bels or whatever it is but it just
[49:43] so happens you're not looking for that
[49:45] store you're looking for Sears or you're
[49:47] looking for whatever more but you can't
[49:50] get to the other place if you don't know
[49:53] where you are so you got to find out
[49:56] where you are and then find out okay
[50:00] ultimately what I'm wanting to do I'm
[50:02] wanting to get ready to get in the
[50:04] Rapture so I can leave this world is
[50:07] that what we want we want to be ready we
[50:09] believe we're in the age of the Rapture
[50:11] so we need to find out where we are so
[50:15] Satan doesn't always work only on trying
[50:18] to confuse the people of where they're
[50:21] going but try to confuse them of where
[50:24] they are now dis sensationally if he can
[50:28] confuse people and try to tell them that
[50:32] they're actually still under the third
[50:34] word or the third ray of light or
[50:39] they've not really moved into the fourth
[50:43] ray of light or the fourth word that God
[50:46] said would come in the last days then
[50:49] what they're going to do is there in
[50:51] proximity to where they need to go it's
[50:54] going to put them way off so they're
[50:57] trying to look and say okay so where are
[50:59] we where are we you see that's where
[51:01] with the majority of Christendom today
[51:05] they don't have no clue where we are
[51:07] prophetically so the Lutheran there's
[51:09] several dispensation behind the
[51:12] Methodist there's several dispensations
[51:14] behind the Pentecostals are behind for
[51:18] some of the message people that have
[51:21] gone no farther than just God Center
[51:24] Prophet they are behind also
[51:27] and why does Satan do that because he
[51:30] knows they'll never get to where they
[51:33] need to be if they don't know where they
[51:36] are it's one reason why that so many
[51:40] people constantly fight the thing do I
[51:43] have the Holy Ghost do I or don't I well
[51:46] sometimes I think I do sometimes I think
[51:48] I don't I believe I do after that
[51:51] service oh yes I know that I do and then
[51:53] a preacher will preach another service
[51:55] and it leaves you hanging well I'm not
[51:56] sure now I don't know where I'm at don't
[51:59] you understand why he does that it's to
[52:01] confuse you it's to confuse you with
[52:04] your walk with God you cannot have
[52:07] abundant growing revelatory Fai in your
[52:10] walk with God if you're still struggling
[52:13] am I Born Again or not am I just
[52:16] Justified or Sanctified I don't know I
[52:18] need to know where I'm at I mean those
[52:20] what I'm talking about now I believe
[52:22] with all of my heart that in this last
[52:24] days that God has given us a message
[52:27] that we can apply the token with but it
[52:29] is not just a message of the token it is
[52:33] a message of assurance that we can know
[52:38] beyond a shadow of a doubt that we have
[52:40] passed from deaths unto life and then
[52:43] what does that do that helps us to be
[52:45] identified with where we are well if we
[52:47] know we're truly born again then we know
[52:51] when we hear messages preached that are
[52:53] calling us to a closer walk with God
[52:56] then by that being able to identify
[52:59] where we are then we know that message
[53:01] is not telling us that we need the Holy
[53:04] Ghost it's telling us we need to let the
[53:07] Holy Ghost we have mature itself and
[53:11] grow out of us and we're being corrected
[53:14] in that way but if a person is
[53:17] constantly going back and forth well I
[53:19] don't know if I got the holy ghost or or
[53:20] not I think I do I don't know if I do or
[53:22] not whenever they hear sermons they
[53:25] process it through that mixed state
[53:28] because they don't know where they are
[53:31] it's time for every person in this
[53:33] church to know where you are with God
[53:38] men women boys girls every one of us so
[53:42] we can know exactly where we are so we
[53:45] can go on from where we are and be what
[53:49] God has called us to be now let's watch
[53:53] this also then how that the church ages
[53:56] parallel the individual walk before God
[53:59] so watch this in page 377 paragraph 2
[54:03] this age started just after the turn of
[54:06] the 20th century now notice the time
[54:08] frame where we are this is in the resume
[54:11] of the ages and it was to be the age in
[54:14] which the true church would return to
[54:18] being the bride she was at Pentecost now
[54:23] remember this is the age when the true
[54:26] Brad is going to return to being the way
[54:29] she was at Pentecost not UA Street
[54:34] Pentecost but the original now remember
[54:37] what makes it so confusing sometimes is
[54:40] because we have two
[54:43] dispensations that are going to be
[54:45] called by similar
[54:47] names so the original was called the
[54:50] original Pentecost then another one
[54:53] happens in
[54:54] 1906 what do they call it
[54:57] Pentecostal so both of them now are
[55:00] going to have a move of God now watch
[55:04] this it was to be the age in which the
[55:06] true church would return to being the
[55:09] bride she was at Pentecost no she's not
[55:12] returning to be the
[55:14] church but the
[55:17] bride we know there must be of
[55:20] necessity a return of dynamic power so
[55:26] it's not just intellectual it's not just
[55:29] reading it's not just knowledge it's not
[55:32] just quoting quotes quoting scriptures
[55:35] but there must be of necessity a return
[55:39] of dynamic power the Believers sense
[55:43] this in their spirits and begin crying
[55:47] to God for a new outpouring such as was
[55:52] in the first century now watch what's
[55:56] going going on the Believers sense this
[55:59] in their spirit so they're walking into
[56:02] the mall of God and they sense in their
[56:06] Spirit there's a promise there's a
[56:09] promise God God wants to restore God
[56:11] wants to send something back to us God
[56:13] wants to wants us to be on fire God
[56:16] wants us to have the manifestation of
[56:18] the gifts and the promised word and they
[56:21] begin to cry and they begin to pray now
[56:23] watch they're finding out where they are
[56:27] they're lacking something they need more
[56:30] now their Methodist grandmothers and
[56:33] grandfathers had shouted their mothers
[56:36] and fathers had become the Highway of
[56:40] Holiness people and some of the
[56:42] independent Pentecostals but it hasn't
[56:45] really yet merged so the Pentecostal is
[56:48] basically just a an upgrade on the the
[56:50] Nazarene and the Methodist but they
[56:53] still didn't have the restoration of
[56:55] gifts
[56:56] but they shouted and they more emotion
[56:59] was coming in the church services and
[57:01] they would pass out on the floor and
[57:04] they'd get fans and fan them and they'
[57:06] lay on the floor and theyd get water and
[57:08] pour it in their face I ain't talking
[57:10] about Pentecostals this was Methodist
[57:13] and Nazarene and hus people but now
[57:16] Watch What Happens what seemed to
[57:20] be the
[57:24] answer now you talking about tricky
[57:27] brother
[57:29] sister so genuine sincere people of
[57:34] God are seeking God's face they're
[57:39] sensing it in their Spirit they're
[57:41] looking at the mall directory as we
[57:44] would say and it's Sav you all are right
[57:47] here you need more than the methodus you
[57:50] need more than the nazarenes you need
[57:54] more and they began to pray and
[57:59] pray and what
[58:02] seemed to be the
[58:06] answer came as many began to speak in
[58:12] tongues and manifest
[58:16] gifts of the
[58:18] Spirit now remember the prophet said it
[58:22] seemed to be the answer so what did did
[58:26] they take this as oh
[58:29] my this is what they had on the day of
[58:32] Pentecost this is the original
[58:35] church it's happened again in California
[58:38] it's in Zeus the Street Revival this is
[58:41] it this is the original bride
[58:43] move come on
[58:46] now well it seemed that
[58:52] way I kind of figured y'all be quiet but
[58:54] I didn't think it'd be this soon
[58:58] it was then
[59:00] believed that this was
[59:03] indeed the
[59:05] long
[59:07] awaited
[59:11] restoration oh this is what we've waited
[59:14] for for years God said I'll restore
[59:17] sayith the Lord all the Canam all the
[59:20] Palmer worm the caterpillar I'll do it
[59:22] I'll do it now what's what's going on
[59:25] Satan is trying to confuse them on where
[59:29] they are and the prophecy at
[59:33] hand it all has to do with
[59:36] season and
[59:41] timing so they're convinced brother John
[59:44] this is acts
[59:46] two it's it's it's here it's on the
[59:53] earth now watch it was in believe that
[59:55] this this was indeed the long awaited
[59:59] restoration it was
[1:00:04] not sir for the latter rain can come
[1:00:09] only after the former rain which is the
[1:00:14] spring or teaching rain amen the latter
[1:00:19] rain then is the Harvest rain how could
[1:00:22] this be the real thing
[1:00:26] when the teaching Reign had not
[1:00:30] come the prophet messenger who was to be
[1:00:34] sent to teach the people to turn the
[1:00:38] hearts of the children back to the
[1:00:40] Pentecostal fathers had not yet
[1:00:44] come but as far as they were
[1:00:47] concerned they didn't need him
[1:00:51] anyway so instead of looking by the word
[1:00:56] and saying okay well we are part of it
[1:01:00] but it don't end here there there comes
[1:01:04] something greater than us this is the
[1:01:07] restoration of gifts but instead of
[1:01:09] leaving their message where God put it
[1:01:13] as the restoration of
[1:01:15] gifts they said this is the definite
[1:01:21] evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:01:23] now when they added those few words
[1:01:26] words the spirit of
[1:01:29] organization got in this
[1:01:33] move then everybody that spoke in
[1:01:36] tongues as far as the way they looked at
[1:01:39] it had the Holy Ghost we've been there
[1:01:42] done that ain't we Lance oh
[1:01:45] yeah well as soon as you spoke in
[1:01:47] tongues that was it you got the Holy
[1:01:50] Ghost now think what Satan had done
[1:01:53] sincere people crying
[1:01:56] praying seeking God looking in the Bible
[1:02:00] hungering and thirsting after
[1:02:04] God no wonder the prophet said if it's
[1:02:07] God you seek be sure it's God you get
[1:02:16] right good advice don't you think now
[1:02:19] what so they thought and taught that
[1:02:24] what happened in 190 six was the light
[1:02:27] of rain but they had it backwards the
[1:02:31] light of rain can only come after the
[1:02:34] former Reign comes
[1:02:37] first and the prophet had not even been
[1:02:40] born yet certainly had not come to his
[1:02:44] maturity in his message to bring the
[1:02:45] word now notice as he goes on he says
[1:02:49] that the prophet messenger who was to be
[1:02:52] sent to teach the people and turn the
[1:02:55] hearts of the the children back to the
[1:02:57] Pentecostal fathers had not yet come but
[1:03:00] we've got this group then that was come
[1:03:02] out in 1906 and they made the claim we
[1:03:07] are the
[1:03:08] original
[1:03:12] Pentecostals we are the
[1:03:15] original it's been born just like it was
[1:03:19] and Acts
[1:03:22] 2 but when you go to reading Acts 2
[1:03:25] compared to what they had it wasn't or
[1:03:28] acts 8:16 or acts 8 or any of them other
[1:03:31] places praise the Lord but yet they made
[1:03:35] the claim to
[1:03:39] originality to
[1:03:41] originality you see the Catholic Church
[1:03:43] does exactly the same thing and the
[1:03:45] bride makes the same claim that's the
[1:03:48] very claim of all the churches they are
[1:03:52] the original well I'll tell you how
[1:03:54] we're going to know who is come on the
[1:03:56] one who leaves the world in a body
[1:03:58] change that's right that will be the
[1:04:01] latter rain and the latter rain will
[1:04:04] anoint their former Reign you see only
[1:04:08] those who receive the former Reign under
[1:04:13] the prophet's Ministry of Malachi 4 will
[1:04:16] actually have seed life to be anointed
[1:04:20] for the latter
[1:04:22] rain so Pentecost then had it B
[1:04:25] backwards now did they have great
[1:04:27] manifestation of gifts yes there was
[1:04:30] great healing there was signs there was
[1:04:32] wonders there was Miracles my brother
[1:04:35] Jim Woodson was telling us whenever we
[1:04:37] went over into badine North Carolina
[1:04:39] making some deliveries over there and
[1:04:41] some of his family was over there and he
[1:04:43] was telling us about some of the people
[1:04:45] and they used to prophesy and have
[1:04:47] prophecies that was just unbelievable
[1:04:50] the prophecies that they give out
[1:04:52] absolutely incredible not some of this
[1:04:55] gener IC stuff that we hear today but
[1:04:58] you you'll be here and you'll go there
[1:04:59] and you'll do this and you'll do that
[1:05:01] and happen exactly to the letter didn't
[1:05:03] it brother Jim and you know some of the
[1:05:06] ones even that I saw in Pentecost Lance
[1:05:08] and his family also have seen and some
[1:05:10] of you with your backgr but yet making
[1:05:14] that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:17] the denominational spirit that Satan
[1:05:19] wanted now notice what he said thus what
[1:05:23] was thought to be the restoration and
[1:05:26] the final quickening unto the
[1:05:29] Rapture had not
[1:05:32] come in it was a
[1:05:35] mixture of the unrighteous partaking of
[1:05:39] spiritual blessing and manifesting in
[1:05:42] the Holy Ghost as we've kept pointing
[1:05:44] out to you and it
[1:05:48] also was devil
[1:05:54] power so can you imagine in a church
[1:05:58] meeting the Holy Ghost is falling and
[1:06:01] people are being blessed and getting
[1:06:03] saved and my speaking in tongues and
[1:06:05] whatever more that they were doing and
[1:06:07] demons were moving right in that same
[1:06:11] service and people were becoming
[1:06:13] possessed by
[1:06:21] demons and it also was devil power as
[1:06:25] men were under the control of
[1:06:29] devils yet no one seemed to realize
[1:06:33] it then to prove that it was not the
[1:06:37] real these people even before a second
[1:06:41] generation had appeared
[1:06:43] organized wrote their unscriptural
[1:06:46] doctrines and built their own fences and
[1:06:50] this is what I say to us as message
[1:06:54] people if we are not careful we are
[1:06:57] heading to the same
[1:06:59] fulfillment of this quote right
[1:07:01] here we're going to make our own fences
[1:07:05] we're going to make our own this is what
[1:07:07] we believe and we don't believe nothing
[1:07:09] else but that period stop that's the end
[1:07:12] of it bless God I'll tell you one thing
[1:07:15] and if you don't see it the way we do
[1:07:17] you ain't going what what's the
[1:07:18] difference between us in any other
[1:07:20] organization when we do that
[1:07:25] my we can't even go to a to a Mee and
[1:07:28] because well I'll tell you one thing
[1:07:29] they don't believe this the way I do you
[1:07:30] know what if we're not careful we're
[1:07:32] going to get to a place we can't go
[1:07:33] nowhere we won't have no confidence in
[1:07:35] nobody but oursel and you get that away
[1:07:38] and you're losing fellowship with
[1:07:40] god well come on somebody say amen amen
[1:07:45] oh my notice they wrote their
[1:07:47] unscriptural doctrines and built their
[1:07:49] own fences as every other group ahead of
[1:07:54] them did look at all the fences friends
[1:07:56] that are around us look at the fences
[1:07:59] many of you that have been around the
[1:08:00] message for years and years you've been
[1:08:02] in one fence and into another and out of
[1:08:04] that one into another what's a fence for
[1:08:06] it's to group people or animals or
[1:08:10] something together and put a fence
[1:08:12] around them and keep them in there and
[1:08:14] not let nobody in or not let nobody
[1:08:18] out well bless God I'll tell you one
[1:08:20] thing you can't come to our church if
[1:08:22] you don't so and so we won't let you do
[1:08:24] who in the world gave you the keys to
[1:08:26] the kingdom who in the world made you
[1:08:29] the bishop over God's people and their
[1:08:31] souls to say you can't come boy if you
[1:08:34] don't have church the way we do at our
[1:08:35] church you ain't even having Church who
[1:08:37] made your church the example for
[1:08:39] everybody in the
[1:08:43] message well
[1:08:45] Hallelujah notice remember while Jesus
[1:08:49] was upon the Earth so was
[1:08:52] Judas each came from a different spirit
[1:08:55] spirit and upon death each
[1:08:59] went to his own
[1:09:02] place the spirit of Christ later came
[1:09:05] back upon the true
[1:09:07] church and the spirit of
[1:09:10] Judas came back upon the false
[1:09:14] church now do you understand there are
[1:09:17] people in our message
[1:09:20] ranks that are working under the spirit
[1:09:23] of Judas
[1:09:26] they will betray true men of
[1:09:28] God they will lie on them sell them out
[1:09:32] for money or
[1:09:33] whatever working under the spirit of
[1:09:38] Judas there will be some preachers that
[1:09:41] will be saved if no more for the reason
[1:09:43] that God can prove to the devil he can
[1:09:45] do
[1:09:47] it some of the greatest troublemakers
[1:09:50] I've ever met in my life are men who
[1:09:52] said they're preachers let me tell you
[1:09:54] something every a man that says he's a
[1:09:56] preacher don't mean he's a man of God
[1:09:58] that's right there's all kinds of men
[1:10:00] that are preachers but it don't mean
[1:10:02] they God call in come on now don't get
[1:10:04] quiet on me
[1:10:06] already how do you judge them by the
[1:10:08] word not by
[1:10:10] signs so watch the spirit of Christ came
[1:10:13] back upon his church the spirit of Judas
[1:10:17] came back upon the false church now
[1:10:20] watch what about the true seed it will
[1:10:23] happen just as we have said the people
[1:10:26] of God are being made ready by the word
[1:10:29] of truth from the messenger to this age
[1:10:34] can't you see why the devil is trying to
[1:10:37] come in our own ranks I know friends you
[1:10:39] may wonder why is brother Donny keeps
[1:10:41] saying this why does brother Donnie keep
[1:10:43] going this way because whether or not
[1:10:44] you understand it more and more
[1:10:46] preachers around this message are not
[1:10:48] preaching the message at
[1:10:50] all some of them won't even stand and
[1:10:53] read quotes anymore they won't even
[1:10:56] stand and make references to what the
[1:10:58] prophet taught in this day well if
[1:11:00] that's what you want I'll tell you one
[1:11:02] thing it's time for you to leave or me
[1:11:04] one because as long as I'm going to be
[1:11:06] here at this church I'm not only going
[1:11:08] to preach the Bible I'm going to preach
[1:11:10] to you the message of this hour it's
[1:11:13] going to take the message of this hour
[1:11:16] to get us out of
[1:11:18] here we've heard the story of Jonah
[1:11:21] we've heard the story of uh of Noah
[1:11:23] we've heard all of that it's going to
[1:11:25] take more than that to get us out of
[1:11:27] here and a body change it's going to
[1:11:30] take the message of Malachi
[1:11:36] 4 so the people of God are being made
[1:11:39] ready by the word of truth from the
[1:11:42] messenger to this age in
[1:11:45] her will be the
[1:11:48] fullness of
[1:11:51] Pentecost but my question to you is
[1:11:55] which
[1:11:59] one the Acts 2
[1:12:03] version or the isusa street one cuz they
[1:12:07] are not the
[1:12:11] same that's why I'm not interested
[1:12:13] friends in mixing ausa street with what
[1:12:17] we have I've done been there and done
[1:12:20] that if I wanted that why in the world
[1:12:22] was I hungering for something more I
[1:12:24] should have just stayed where was ain't
[1:12:26] that right brother Larry but it didn't
[1:12:28] satisfy me when I was in it it sure
[1:12:30] won't satisfy me now after I've eat the
[1:12:32] good food I've been eating
[1:12:34] now oh
[1:12:36] my in her will be the fullness of
[1:12:39] Pentecost how many believes this amen
[1:12:42] for the spirit will bring the people
[1:12:45] right back to where they were
[1:12:50] at beginning the
[1:12:53] beginning that is is thus sayith the
[1:13:00] Lord now watch again in page 379 and he
[1:13:04] reads these scriptures in Joel 2 that I
[1:13:07] read to you when we open the service now
[1:13:09] it says God is going to restore the
[1:13:12] Lutheran AIDS did not restore the church
[1:13:14] it started a Reformation the westan AIDS
[1:13:18] did not restore the Pentecostal age now
[1:13:21] notice the Pentecostal age
[1:13:26] did not
[1:13:29] restore so why would I want to point you
[1:13:34] back to what Pentecost had when it did
[1:13:36] not
[1:13:39] restore it was an added element do we
[1:13:43] need it
[1:13:46] yes do we need
[1:13:50] justification what about
[1:13:52] sanctification well if we need them to
[1:13:55] then wouldn't you say we also need the
[1:13:56] restoration of
[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:14:01] gifts oh my but God has to restore for
[1:14:05] he cannot deny his word this is not the
[1:14:09] resurrection of the church it is the
[1:14:14] restoration God will take the
[1:14:17] church right back to Pentecost of
[1:14:21] differentiation now the beginning notice
[1:14:25] in verse 25 Joel two the Locust
[1:14:28] cankerworm caterpillar Palmer worm have
[1:14:30] eaten all but the root and a small bit
[1:14:33] of the stem now we are told that all
[1:14:34] those insects are of one and the same in
[1:14:37] different stages they are the Antichrist
[1:14:40] spirit manifested in organization
[1:14:43] denomination and false Doctrine Through
[1:14:45] the Ages
[1:14:47] notice
[1:14:49] organization
[1:14:51] denomination and false
[1:14:54] Doctrine do you understand many of the
[1:14:56] message people that we're not an
[1:14:57] organization and they think they're
[1:14:59] exempt because they're preaching false
[1:15:01] Doctrine it's the same Antichrist Spirit
[1:15:05] you may not have the structure of an
[1:15:07] organization that your head is in
[1:15:10] Cleveland Tennessee or up in akan Ohio
[1:15:13] but when you deny the word of God for
[1:15:15] the hour you're anointed by
[1:15:21] Antichrist I love this and the poor
[1:15:24] little root and stalk is going to be
[1:15:26] restored God isn't going to plant a new
[1:15:31] church but he's going to bring his
[1:15:34] original planting back to the original
[1:15:39] seed he is doing it as stated in verse
[1:15:42] 23 by the teaching or former Reign next
[1:15:47] will come the Harvest rain or
[1:15:51] rapturing
[1:15:53] facei but why is the Harvest rain going
[1:15:56] to fall
[1:15:58] on now you see whenever they would plant
[1:16:01] this and the prophecy that they gave he
[1:16:04] was taking the planting season as it
[1:16:06] would have been in the country of Israel
[1:16:09] and that part of the Mediterranean so
[1:16:11] they would get the early rains in the
[1:16:14] springtime and then they would break up
[1:16:16] the ground they would plant the seed in
[1:16:18] the ground wherever it was suitable
[1:16:20] depending on what type of product that
[1:16:21] they wanted and then the former rign
[1:16:25] they would sew that down and the seed
[1:16:26] would be planted and the latter rain
[1:16:29] would produce the crop so the latter
[1:16:32] rain depending on what it fell upon it
[1:16:35] would produce the crop look at our
[1:16:38] nation the state that it's in how do we
[1:16:40] get here because some of our fathers our
[1:16:44] grandfathers some of the Senate some of
[1:16:46] the Congress of years ago that started
[1:16:48] passing some of these liberal bills and
[1:16:51] these woke moves that's all around
[1:16:53] everywhere that's what's got us where we
[1:16:55] are now when a boy don't even know if
[1:16:57] he's a boy no more and a girl don't know
[1:16:59] if she's a girl no more come on
[1:17:02] Church what we've never thought would
[1:17:04] ever get to such a place my goodness
[1:17:06] that that our government would want to
[1:17:08] put tampons in a in a in a man's
[1:17:10] bathroom are you kidding me you mean we
[1:17:13] got men that are that insane yeah we do
[1:17:16] they are that insane and they want to
[1:17:18] run our government well praise the Lord
[1:17:21] and it's going to get worse and worse as
[1:17:23] we go in time
[1:17:25] oh but brother Donnie Donald Trump
[1:17:27] wanted he's going to take us back to God
[1:17:29] don't you believe that for one minute of
[1:17:31] your life there's only one way we're
[1:17:34] going back to God that is not by Donald
[1:17:37] Trump or the Republicans or the
[1:17:39] independent that's by the coming of the
[1:17:41] Lord Jesus I know a lot of people are
[1:17:44] making Donald Trump the Messiah he ain't
[1:17:47] my Messiah he is not my savior I'm
[1:17:50] looking for my Lord Jesus to come
[1:17:56] amen oh
[1:17:58] Hallelujah notice this my my next will
[1:18:02] come the Harvest rain or rapturing F so
[1:18:06] when the Harvest rain falls on the bride
[1:18:09] who's been feeding for years on this
[1:18:12] revealed word what will it produce in
[1:18:15] her it will turn her inside
[1:18:19] out she's feeding and storing that word
[1:18:22] up in her soul her soul will manifest
[1:18:26] that final attribute of God inside of
[1:18:29] her and it will start from the inside of
[1:18:31] her soul and come out to her body her
[1:18:34] eyes will change her hair will change
[1:18:36] her limbs will change and in a moment in
[1:18:38] a twinkling of an ey she will be chain
[1:18:41] why because she's been feeding on the
[1:18:43] anointed word of Malachi 4 and the light
[1:18:46] of rain which is rapturing Faith is
[1:18:48] going to fall on him what's it going to
[1:18:50] do to the World Council of churches head
[1:18:52] up in the person of the devil in the
[1:18:55] form of the Antichrist come on somebody
[1:18:59] what's he going to do to the nations of
[1:19:00] the world they're going to gather in the
[1:19:02] plains of the field Where I Stood many
[1:19:04] years ago in the valley of megiddo as I
[1:19:08] stood up there where Elijah had stood
[1:19:10] there near his cave and look to the left
[1:19:12] as far as you can see and look to the
[1:19:15] right as far as you can see and there in
[1:19:17] the valley of magto and they will gather
[1:19:20] together all the nations of the world
[1:19:23] and the L of rain's going to fault and
[1:19:25] what are they going to do try to kill
[1:19:27] the Jews and they're going to come
[1:19:28] against them and the Lord Jesus will
[1:19:31] come but you and I won't be there as far
[1:19:34] as down on the earth we're going to come
[1:19:36] back riding on white horses why we have
[1:19:39] been anointed to fly we have been
[1:19:42] anointed to feed on the unfailing body
[1:19:45] word of the son of man and when the Lord
[1:19:48] Jesus comes to fight the battle of
[1:19:50] Armageddon and he'll look around behind
[1:19:52] him and say come on children go with
[1:19:55] and there will come the Bride of the
[1:19:56] Ephesian age of the samna age of the
[1:20:00] Sardis age of the thyra age and there
[1:20:03] will be as that bride Hallelujah the
[1:20:06] resurrected dead anointed by the latter
[1:20:10] [Applause]
[1:20:18] rain
[1:20:21] Hallelujah notice this thus at this very
[1:20:24] moment moment we're in the complete
[1:20:27] fulfillment of Matthew
[1:20:28] 24:24 in so much if it were possible
[1:20:32] they shall deceive the very
[1:20:35] elect and who is that that shall attempt
[1:20:39] to deceive the very
[1:20:42] elect while the spirit of the
[1:20:46] Antichrist in the false anointed ones of
[1:20:50] this last
[1:20:52] day these false ones have already come
[1:20:56] in jesus' name
[1:20:59] wow so you mean they're not just saying
[1:21:02] father son Holy
[1:21:03] Ghost they've
[1:21:05] updated they're saying in Jesus name
[1:21:09] claiming they have been anointed by God
[1:21:13] for the last day they are the false
[1:21:17] Messiahs anointed ones they claim that
[1:21:21] they are prophets
[1:21:25] but are they one with the
[1:21:30] word
[1:21:31] never they have added to it or taken
[1:21:35] from it now listen this is the tricky
[1:21:38] part no one denies that the spirit of
[1:21:41] God manifesting in
[1:21:45] gifts is upon them but like balum they
[1:21:50] all have their programs make their
[1:21:53] appeal for money
[1:21:56] exercise gifts but deny the word or
[1:22:00] bypass it notice the difference
[1:22:04] now some of them will deny
[1:22:07] it others will just bypass It Go Around
[1:22:12] It Don't Preach anything don't say
[1:22:14] anything that's going to cause anybody
[1:22:16] any
[1:22:17] problems you
[1:22:21] jellyfish well we believe in Holiness
[1:22:24] here but we we we we ain't going to
[1:22:25] preach it for about 35 years we're going
[1:22:27] to see if we can win somebody in it
[1:22:29] might be that very thing they need
[1:22:30] deliver to their minis
[1:22:32] skirts well praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:22:37] notice but the deny the word or bypass
[1:22:39] it for fear that a
[1:22:43] controversy might diminish their
[1:22:46] chances for greater
[1:22:50] gain so whether it's monetary or
[1:22:52] following or numbers
[1:22:55] uhhuh so they just you know scur around
[1:22:58] certain
[1:22:59] things don't you understand every true
[1:23:02] man of God will be faced with that
[1:23:05] Temptation right
[1:23:06] there every one of
[1:23:09] them and he will know it and he will see
[1:23:12] it and he can look at one side and see
[1:23:16] if he just skirts around certain things
[1:23:18] Don't Preach this don't say that don't
[1:23:20] say that you'll be more liked you'll be
[1:23:22] more accepted you'll have a bigger
[1:23:24] following you'll have this and that and
[1:23:26] the other and then he'll see the other
[1:23:28] side the harder way the narrow way
[1:23:31] people will walk away from you they'll
[1:23:33] turn back from you they'll ridicule you
[1:23:35] they'll run you down they'll stab you in
[1:23:37] the back they'll do this that the other
[1:23:39] well what person as far as feelings
[1:23:42] wouldn't rather choose the easier way oh
[1:23:44] yeah sure everybody will like me man
[1:23:46] aive them and who wants you know who
[1:23:48] wants to be shot at and who wants this
[1:23:49] and that and the other who wants to do
[1:23:51] all that sort of thing so every servant
[1:23:54] of God will face that challenge every
[1:23:57] one of them and it's not like they'll
[1:23:58] face it once some some some of them will
[1:24:01] face it over and over again because God
[1:24:03] is using them to prove to the devil I've
[1:24:06] still got some boys down on the earth in
[1:24:08] the latest in age you compromise and
[1:24:10] you'll do everything you can devil but
[1:24:12] you can't get my boys cuz they're born
[1:24:14] of my
[1:24:15] jeans oh yeah watch this oh my they deny
[1:24:20] the word or bypass it for fear that a
[1:24:22] controversy might diminish their chances
[1:24:25] for greater gain yet they preach
[1:24:30] listen
[1:24:32] salvation and
[1:24:35] deliverance through the power of
[1:24:42] God so they're not sing there offering
[1:24:45] you a
[1:24:46] rosary they're not telling you to pray
[1:24:49] to St Andrew for this and St Anthony for
[1:24:51] that and you know St Joseph for this and
[1:24:53] that and the other they are preaching
[1:24:54] Deliverance by the salvation of the Lord
[1:24:57] Jesus and preaching Deliverance by the
[1:24:59] power of
[1:25:04] God just
[1:25:07] like
[1:25:10] Judas was a Ministry
[1:25:13] imparted by
[1:25:17] Christ remember he tells us in the
[1:25:19] church age book that Judas did not have
[1:25:21] an inferior Ministry so un like the 11
[1:25:25] they were all anointed and they casting
[1:25:26] out devils and you know doing all the
[1:25:28] supernatural things and Judas is just
[1:25:30] kind of carrying along nothing ever
[1:25:32] followed his ministry and he couldn't
[1:25:34] ready preach I imagine he is probably
[1:25:36] one of the most charismatic preachers in
[1:25:39] the whole
[1:25:40] bunch I imagine that dude had Miracles
[1:25:43] that was
[1:25:46] phenomenal makes you think no
[1:25:49] I Miracles that was so phenomenal you've
[1:25:52] heard me say it from years and years ago
[1:25:54] that when the Lord Jesus said one of you
[1:25:56] is going to betray me they questioned
[1:26:00] thems before they even questioned him
[1:26:03] when you look at the Last Supper and the
[1:26:05] way that they set they didn't set the
[1:26:07] way we set like this you're setting this
[1:26:09] way but they prostrated themselves on
[1:26:11] Long sofas and they would have been
[1:26:14] leaning back one against the other Judas
[1:26:16] was right by the Lord
[1:26:22] Jesus and when they look at him at the
[1:26:25] table they thought oh
[1:26:28] no he's fixing to take Jesus
[1:26:32] place he already had the
[1:26:35] money Jesus really trusted him even
[1:26:39] though he was a thief that's
[1:26:42] right when they said it's the last
[1:26:45] supper and they come in and sit down and
[1:26:48] they looked up there sitting at the
[1:26:49] table here's the center of the table
[1:26:51] arced sort of like this and they looked
[1:26:53] up there and there was Judas and he said
[1:26:56] oh dear
[1:26:57] God Judas must be going to take over
[1:27:01] Jesus had been telling us he's going to
[1:27:04] leave I knew Judas was a Preacher Man I
[1:27:08] knew that guy had
[1:27:11] Supernatural I didn't know he was going
[1:27:13] to take over well it wasn't actually
[1:27:16] that Judas was going to take
[1:27:18] over Judas was going to be
[1:27:22] taken over
[1:27:29] Satan having now entered into the heart
[1:27:33] of Judas Simon's
[1:27:37] son Jesus knowing all things have been
[1:27:40] given to him by the
[1:27:44] father oh
[1:27:46] Lord he was so
[1:27:49] close they looked right at
[1:27:52] him and didn't see
[1:27:55] it Jesus said have not I chose 12 of you
[1:28:00] and one of you is a
[1:28:03] devil not going to be but already
[1:28:08] is imagine Jesus having a devil in his
[1:28:11] ministry
[1:28:16] team
[1:28:19] wow notice oh
[1:28:22] my they preach out salvation and
[1:28:24] deliverance to the power of God just
[1:28:26] like Judas with a Ministry imparted by
[1:28:28] Christ but because they are wrong
[1:28:33] seed consequently they have a wrong
[1:28:36] Spirit motivating them religious oh my
[1:28:41] they outshine the
[1:28:44] elect in
[1:28:46] effort and
[1:28:51] Zeal wow but it is leot
[1:28:56] toan not of Christ for it looks for big
[1:28:59] crowds big
[1:29:01] programs and startling
[1:29:05] signs amongst
[1:29:08] them startling
[1:29:11] signs so not something that could be
[1:29:14] questioned but a sign that is so
[1:29:19] phenomenal it would be startling
[1:29:25] boy I got you thinking tonight ain't it
[1:29:27] yeah good
[1:29:29] deal startling signs among them they
[1:29:34] preach the second coming of
[1:29:38] Christ but deny the
[1:29:41] Advent of the Prophet
[1:29:44] messenger
[1:29:48] a so they preach the coming of
[1:29:51] Christ but they don't preach the bride
[1:29:54] coming of
[1:29:56] Christ and they don't preach the coming
[1:30:00] of Christ to reveal himself in profit
[1:30:03] form in the last days remember he tells
[1:30:06] us in sort 1965 the Elijah of this
[1:30:10] day is the Lord Jesus
[1:30:13] Christ he will come according to Luke
[1:30:18] 1730 let me just tell you what God's
[1:30:21] given to us
[1:30:24] so there was a family that lost an
[1:30:26] 18-year-old son brother Welch Evans and
[1:30:31] his wife so they were tore a piece and
[1:30:34] brother Brandon was out of
[1:30:35] town they try to call get in touch with
[1:30:38] him they call Billy Paul brother Brandon
[1:30:41] returns to
[1:30:43] call he says brother wel the Lord hasn't
[1:30:47] showed me anything about your son I I I
[1:30:49] don't know he hasn't showed me you can
[1:30:52] find this in Sister Angel's book gener
[1:30:54] ations
[1:30:55] testimonies so he said let me let me see
[1:30:59] let me pray let me see if I can find
[1:31:02] something from the
[1:31:04] Lord so he told them he
[1:31:08] searched the
[1:31:12] regions the
[1:31:14] regions and couldn't find him
[1:31:19] nowhere so he went back to
[1:31:22] where the automobile that he was in hit
[1:31:25] a
[1:31:26] truck so he went back to that
[1:31:33] place and then he calls brother welz and
[1:31:35] tells
[1:31:38] him he must have been in the passenger
[1:31:42] seat up
[1:31:44] front because I saw the wreck so you
[1:31:48] imagine God lets him now see the wreck
[1:31:50] again in a
[1:31:51] vision and he said I saw the wreck and
[1:31:55] when the car hit the
[1:31:57] truck I saw a
[1:32:00] light go out of the passenger side in
[1:32:04] the front
[1:32:05] seat and it went up before the Throne of
[1:32:10] God brother Welch if you want to know
[1:32:14] where your son is right
[1:32:17] now he's talking to my daughter Sharon
[1:32:21] Rose
[1:32:25] glory to
[1:32:29] God and brother wch if we could ask
[1:32:33] him did he want to come back he would
[1:32:36] tell you Daddy I don't want to come
[1:32:40] back and he said when you see him
[1:32:45] again to him it will only seem
[1:32:50] like he's been gone from you
[1:32:58] for three
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:08] minutes for three
[1:33:12] minutes
[1:33:14] why they've
[1:33:15] broke into
[1:33:19] eternity why would God save all these
[1:33:22] secrets of the sixth dimension
[1:33:24] for
[1:33:25] us in the last
[1:33:30] day because we had to find out where we
[1:33:33] were and where we're going when we leave
[1:33:35] here and where our loved ones are and
[1:33:38] they are not dead and there's something
[1:33:41] about hearing it preached and we're
[1:33:42] talking about it you notice that
[1:33:44] atmosphere as it started changing when I
[1:33:46] started talking about that what is it
[1:33:48] hearing that present day truth brings us
[1:33:51] closer to that dimension remember it's
[1:33:54] not but 20 ft from us for those of you
[1:33:56] that was here the other night and
[1:33:57] brother Lewis is and I I preached about
[1:33:59] changing his address and brother Lewis
[1:34:02] had signed a change of address
[1:34:05] notification and I gave his new address
[1:34:09] 20 6 and seven 20 ft from us sixth
[1:34:15] Dimension seventh Church age 26 and 7
[1:34:20] amen
[1:34:22] hallelujah but remember we're not just
[1:34:25] going to 26 and 7 but we're going to
[1:34:28] wind up on 8 because 8 is a new
[1:34:32] beginning The Eighth Day speaks of
[1:34:35] Eternity why was it that God never
[1:34:39] allowed Paul to preach the message of
[1:34:42] the future home of the Heavenly
[1:34:44] bridegroom and the Earthly bride why was
[1:34:46] it reserve for us in this last day why
[1:34:49] couldn't Peter preach things that are to
[1:34:52] be it was reserve for the bride at the
[1:34:56] end time those that are going to be a
[1:34:59] living Remnant Hallelujah when the lter
[1:35:02] rainfalls she'll already have them seeds
[1:35:05] in her heart she'll already have the
[1:35:07] future home she'll already have
[1:35:09] recognizing your day and the lighter
[1:35:12] rain will fall on that
[1:35:17] seed Oh Glory to God
[1:35:29] so you imagine
[1:35:30] Lance and you four
[1:35:36] girls the next time you see your
[1:35:39] mama to her alone to be like she's gone
[1:35:41] about 3
[1:35:47] minutes Paul's been there for 2,000
[1:35:49] years over 2,000
[1:35:52] years but it's like you just
[1:35:55] arrived they ain't going nowhere they
[1:35:57] ain't got nothing to do they ain't got
[1:35:58] no times ain't got no clocks they ain't
[1:35:59] got no
[1:36:00] schedules they've just
[1:36:02] arrived they broke into
[1:36:06] eternity
[1:36:14] Hallelujah where was
[1:36:16] that
[1:36:19] oh let me find myself here they preached
[1:36:22] the second coming of
[1:36:24] Christ but deny the Advent of the
[1:36:27] Prophet
[1:36:28] messenger though empowering
[1:36:31] signs and true
[1:36:33] Revelation he eclipses them
[1:36:37] all can anybody give me a big hearty
[1:36:40] Amen to
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:43] that ah yes this false spirit in the
[1:36:46] last day is so close to the
[1:36:50] real it can be distinguished
[1:36:53] distinguished
[1:36:54] only by its
[1:36:57] deviation from the
[1:37:02] word
[1:37:03] wow but he's already told us that they
[1:37:06] can have signs wonders Miracles right
[1:37:09] preach salvation preach
[1:37:12] Deliverance but wonder what they'll
[1:37:14] deviate
[1:37:18] from apparently they're not going to
[1:37:19] deviate from salvation not going to
[1:37:21] deviate from Supernatural come
[1:37:26] on well this is kind of one of them
[1:37:28] services that get you thinking don't
[1:37:30] it now
[1:37:32] watch and whenever it is caught and
[1:37:36] being anti-
[1:37:39] word it falls back on the one argument
[1:37:42] we have already shown to be false we get
[1:37:45] results don't
[1:37:50] we we have to be of God
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:56] we're getting people
[1:37:58] saved people's getting
[1:38:00] healed we get results don't
[1:38:04] we we have to be of
[1:38:07] God
[1:38:09] ah what crucial times are these in which
[1:38:12] we live can everybody say Amen to that
[1:38:17] how careful we must be that we remain
[1:38:19] True to this word and not take from
[1:38:25] or add to it for he who would speak what
[1:38:30] God has not
[1:38:32] spoken makes him a
[1:38:37] liar so for some around the ranks of the
[1:38:40] message is simply taking away the
[1:38:42] need to assemble ourselves
[1:38:45] together we don't need to we've got the
[1:38:49] tapes we've turned our homes into
[1:38:52] churches there before we go to church
[1:38:54] every day cuz we play tapes every day in
[1:38:57] our home so we really don't need to go
[1:38:59] to church because our home is our church
[1:39:02] and we don't need one another and we
[1:39:04] don't uhuh so you just took away that's
[1:39:07] right from what your very Prophet said
[1:39:10] Christ The Mystery of God revealed that
[1:39:12] if God is in your heart you can't wait
[1:39:15] for them doors back there to open to get
[1:39:18] in and fellowship with your brothers and
[1:39:21] sisters and if you don't feel like that
[1:39:23] I'll tell you it's time you got to
[1:39:35] praying but you see reason we say oh
[1:39:38] well Ephesians 4 says that he gave some
[1:39:43] Apostles and and some prophets and some
[1:39:45] pastors because some people need
[1:39:50] them your name was just took from the
[1:39:53] book of
[1:39:55] life you are twisting Ephesians 4 to
[1:39:59] match your own
[1:40:00] ideology reading the original Greek it
[1:40:03] does not even implied in such a way so
[1:40:06] some people need to go to church but we
[1:40:09] don't cuz we listen to tapes and we
[1:40:11] really don't need to yeah you just added
[1:40:14] to and took
[1:40:15] away think of it
[1:40:18] friends think of
[1:40:20] it oh Lord Jesus
[1:40:24] what I have particularly in mind is this
[1:40:27] about the turn of the century the hunger
[1:40:30] for God that was generated in the
[1:40:31] Philadelphian age brought a cry for the
[1:40:34] spirit of
[1:40:35] God and when the cry was answered by God
[1:40:39] sending forth manifestation in tongues
[1:40:42] and interpretation and
[1:40:45] prophecy a group immediately and most
[1:40:49] contrary to the word Drew up a doctrine
[1:40:51] that tongues was the evidence
[1:40:53] of being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:55] tongues was far from evidence they were
[1:40:58] manifestation but not
[1:41:01] evidence the falsity of the doctrine can
[1:41:04] all oh my not only be seen by lack of
[1:41:06] scripture to substantiate it but those
[1:41:09] who subscribed to the doctrine
[1:41:11] immediately organized on the basis of
[1:41:15] the doctrine proven they were not in the
[1:41:17] truth as they would have people believe
[1:41:20] oh it look good it look look like the
[1:41:25] return of
[1:41:28] Pentecost now you realize there some of
[1:41:30] the preachers in our message that's
[1:41:32] going around and preaching you know if
[1:41:33] you're not having meetings like this
[1:41:35] with them preaching of course in your
[1:41:38] church you better leave your church now
[1:41:41] they don't go ahead and tell you the
[1:41:42] rest of it but I'll go ahead and tell
[1:41:43] you the rest of it leave the church
[1:41:45] you're going to and move to their
[1:41:48] church cuz we're the one that's got the
[1:41:51] move of God now you see what that's
[1:41:52] doing
[1:41:54] it's making another
[1:41:56] denomination so then whoever believes
[1:41:59] like we believe we're the ones with the
[1:42:01] move of
[1:42:03] God well I wonder if we judge the
[1:42:05] Ephesian Church by your
[1:42:08] church or the Corinthian Church by your
[1:42:11] church one if to have the type of
[1:42:13] meetings you have in your church in
[1:42:16] Corinth so I don't understand why God
[1:42:18] didn't make your church one of the
[1:42:20] original
[1:42:21] 12 and instead of making them the
[1:42:24] original 12 and told you to be like them
[1:42:25] instead of them trying to be like
[1:42:28] you whoa we got a problem here Houston
[1:42:32] but you see what they do oh we're it
[1:42:34] we're it we've got it boy we've got the
[1:42:35] brides move how many brides revivals
[1:42:37] have we have and they put a fence around
[1:42:39] it and when you do you're cutting
[1:42:42] yourself
[1:42:44] off Word of Life Church please I beg you
[1:42:48] as a servant of God don't never do that
[1:42:51] to us amen we will cut ourselves off
[1:42:56] from
[1:42:57] God when we do it and it won't happen
[1:43:00] immediately it never
[1:43:02] does but in time we'll sever ourself
[1:43:07] from the rest of the body and then we
[1:43:09] are this Elite whatever we think we are
[1:43:11] and we look down our nose at everybody
[1:43:13] else and you know what God will do God
[1:43:15] will move right around us and reach out
[1:43:17] there and get grab a hold of alley rats
[1:43:19] if he has to he'll do whatever he's got
[1:43:22] to do don't think that we have any
[1:43:24] Monopoly on God don't think that you can
[1:43:26] say who can go to heaven and who can't
[1:43:28] go to heaven don't think that you can
[1:43:30] say well bless God I'll tell you one
[1:43:32] thing I don't this God ain't asking you
[1:43:35] God is telling you what his word says
[1:43:37] and expects you to do
[1:43:38] it is that
[1:43:41] right no it proved it wasn't it could
[1:43:44] not before for it organized that is
[1:43:46] death not life it looked so close to the
[1:43:50] real that multitudes were deceived
[1:43:54] now if it wasn't the genuine what was it
[1:43:57] it was the
[1:43:58] husk the
[1:44:00] CHF in the green soft sheath
[1:44:05] form it looked like it was the real
[1:44:08] thing but as you go into the field and
[1:44:11] see what looks exactly like
[1:44:14] wheat and yet it's only the husk for the
[1:44:16] wheat seed had not yet
[1:44:19] formed so this was but the soft shell
[1:44:22] that looked like the real grain Yet to
[1:44:25] Come the original wheat seed of
[1:44:28] Pentecost was to come back in the last
[1:44:32] age it had been buried at N Sea it sent
[1:44:35] up a shoot at Sardis it grew a tsel at
[1:44:38] Philadelphia it was a mature to look at
[1:44:42] leaa but it would not be back to the
[1:44:45] original until the word was
[1:44:50] restored the prophet had not yet yet
[1:44:53] come upon the
[1:44:54] scene but now according to the time
[1:44:57] wherein we stand in the Le of and age
[1:44:59] the prophet messenger of Revelation
[1:45:02] 10:7 must already be in the
[1:45:06] land praise the Lord once more thus
[1:45:11] saith the Lord must be here already oh
[1:45:15] Hallelujah to be manifested with
[1:45:17] infallible Vindication thus is the true
[1:45:20] seed already maturing and then
[1:45:24] the
[1:45:25] Harvest but what happened in every one
[1:45:27] of these ages they were living in a
[1:45:30] glare of the past
[1:45:34] age notice this an identified Christ
[1:45:37] what was the matter with the Lutheran
[1:45:39] living in the glare of the Lutheran age
[1:45:41] when John Wesley found the secret of
[1:45:43] sanctification they couldn't go they
[1:45:45] were living in the glare of Luther's age
[1:45:47] what happened to the Pentecost is why
[1:45:49] wesle was organized until he was living
[1:45:51] the glare of another age that was in
[1:45:53] Wesley's age when the baptism of the
[1:45:55] Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostals
[1:45:58] they were living in what Wesley said
[1:46:00] sanctification it was hard for them to
[1:46:02] believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:05] and the restoration of the gifts they
[1:46:08] was living in the glare of another age
[1:46:11] now we find out that now we find our
[1:46:14] Pentecostal Brethren are living in the
[1:46:17] glare of a Pentecostal age and they
[1:46:20] still miss it they're trying trying to
[1:46:23] interpret the Pentecostal
[1:46:26] age when we're
[1:46:28] Plum
[1:46:29] past
[1:46:32] that amen well tell me how can I be past
[1:46:37] it if I've got people trying to tell me
[1:46:40] I need to go back to
[1:46:44] it come on now brother Donnie are you
[1:46:47] saying well that we're past it we don't
[1:46:49] need it
[1:46:50] no no we took
[1:46:53] the truth out of that that's right and
[1:46:56] brought it with
[1:46:58] us God sent justification what they do
[1:47:01] they formed an organization out of it
[1:47:03] God called the elect out they pulled the
[1:47:05] truth of justification out with them and
[1:47:08] merg it into the new message
[1:47:10] sanctification is that right then what
[1:47:13] did they do sanctification they formed
[1:47:15] an organization around that and then God
[1:47:17] sent the restoration of the gifts over
[1:47:20] and over again the prophet calls it that
[1:47:21] for Pentecost restoration of the gifts
[1:47:24] and they took justification
[1:47:26] sanctification merged it right in with
[1:47:28] the restoration of gifts and then they
[1:47:30] could look back at the westl move and
[1:47:32] say we're beyond that it didn't mean
[1:47:34] they didn't believe in sanctification
[1:47:37] when the prophet said we're Beyond
[1:47:38] Pentecost it don't mean that we're
[1:47:40] beyond the Pentecostal baptism of the
[1:47:42] Holy Ghost but we're in another time
[1:47:45] frame and the church said so do we
[1:47:49] believe in justification if your bride
[1:47:51] you do do we believe believe in
[1:47:53] sanctification do we believe in the
[1:47:55] baptism of the Holy
[1:47:59] Ghost and the message that Martin Luther
[1:48:01] brought of justification was all right
[1:48:03] for Luther's age but that's as far as it
[1:48:05] went sanctification was fine in Wesley's
[1:48:08] age that was as far as it went then we
[1:48:10] come into the Pentecostal age and the
[1:48:13] restoration of the gifts is a very fine
[1:48:15] thing it was fine in the age but we're
[1:48:19] going beyond that now
[1:48:23] we are beyond that now come on CH it's
[1:48:26] got to where that you can't even read
[1:48:27] quotes like this in certain message
[1:48:29] churches they will shut down on
[1:48:35] you when it gets to where I cannot
[1:48:37] preach the message of the hour it's time
[1:48:40] for me to stay
[1:48:44] home yep if I can't preach the message
[1:48:47] I'll stay at the
[1:48:48] house I mean until y'all want me to go
[1:48:51] somewhere else
[1:48:53] Do We Believe It or
[1:48:57] Not we've got to become
[1:49:01] Beyond this thing because we've done the
[1:49:04] same thing with it they did before make
[1:49:09] an idol
[1:49:12] amen out of
[1:49:14] it I belong to this order of it I belong
[1:49:18] to that order notice he doesn't call it
[1:49:20] denomination but he calls it order
[1:49:23] God will send somebody that'll smash
[1:49:26] that
[1:49:27] thing amen and tear it to
[1:49:34] Pieces praise the
[1:49:36] Lord and confirm his word the full word
[1:49:40] notice praise be to God now we see
[1:49:43] that's true God rich in his
[1:49:47] Mercy let us stand
[1:49:54] let me share one more with you tonight
[1:49:56] Luther went to husk with his first word
[1:49:58] that just shall live of Faith Wesley had
[1:50:01] two words sanctification second definite
[1:50:05] work of Grace Pentecost had the third
[1:50:09] word the restoration of the gifts
[1:50:11] remember the Pentecostal
[1:50:13] message is the
[1:50:15] restoration of the
[1:50:18] gifts the bride's message is more
[1:50:23] than
[1:50:24] restoration of the
[1:50:29] gifts praise the
[1:50:31] lord it's that
[1:50:34] plus Pentecost had the third word
[1:50:38] restoration of gifts
[1:50:41] but the entire seed has to come forth
[1:50:45] notice Luther had a word Wesley had a
[1:50:47] word Pentecost had a word but the fourth
[1:50:51] word is the entire
[1:50:53] seed no wonder Satan wants to keep
[1:50:56] people in a glare of the age behind them
[1:51:00] because they focus on one
[1:51:03] word or another one word or another one
[1:51:07] word why stop at restoration of gifts
[1:51:11] when we can get the entire seed which
[1:51:15] includes all the
[1:51:16] gifts
[1:51:19] amen I took her the other day after the
[1:51:21] service on Sunday was talking about
[1:51:24] receiving the love of God or the god of
[1:51:28] love and I told her I was sitting at the
[1:51:30] house Sunday afternoon and just going
[1:51:33] back through the service and the word
[1:51:34] and stuff and I said you know our
[1:51:37] daughters have a portion of your love
[1:51:41] our church has a portion of your
[1:51:44] love your mother your siblings your
[1:51:48] nieces your
[1:51:50] cousins but I have you
[1:51:55] you and I said it's the same with me
[1:51:58] people in our church have a portion of
[1:52:01] my love I said Harry my brother mention
[1:52:03] Justin my sister-in-laws and mention my
[1:52:06] grandchildren my my
[1:52:09] daughters but I said you have me and
[1:52:13] know me in a way unlike any of them do
[1:52:19] amen you know me when I'm down you know
[1:52:21] me when I'm low
[1:52:23] oh you just be around me and tell why
[1:52:27] cuz she has
[1:52:29] me I don't want just one word amen I
[1:52:33] don't want just two
[1:52:35] words I don't want just three
[1:52:38] words I want
[1:52:40] him and if I get him I get the
[1:52:44] gifts now if anybody tells you that
[1:52:46] brother Donnie don't believes the gifts
[1:52:48] you look them in the face and you tell
[1:52:51] them they are a
[1:52:55] liar I believe in the gifts and I want
[1:52:58] every one of them that God wants you in
[1:53:00] our church but I cannot produce them
[1:53:03] amen and neither can
[1:53:07] you amen oh
[1:53:10] my you see how they
[1:53:13] denominated on one word and another word
[1:53:18] and another word but there's got to be
[1:53:21] something that cannot be
[1:53:23] denominated it's the entirety of the
[1:53:26] life that's in there that has to produce
[1:53:29] itself again on a
[1:53:33] bride justification yes sanctification
[1:53:36] yes gifts yes but remember people focus
[1:53:40] so much on speaking in tongues and
[1:53:42] brother brim said speaking in tongues
[1:53:45] was the
[1:53:46] least of all the
[1:53:50] gifts and okay uh I'll admit it I am
[1:53:54] really weird okay you can you can nod
[1:53:57] your head that's okay not going to hurt
[1:53:58] my feelings I am weird I am strange I'm
[1:54:02] bizarre I have some very unusual
[1:54:06] thoughts I
[1:54:08] believe in all nine spiritual
[1:54:12] gifts instead of just
[1:54:16] three three was what I heard mainly
[1:54:19] talked about in
[1:54:20] Pentecost three is what mainly here and
[1:54:23] talked about in the message I wonder why
[1:54:27] we don't want the other
[1:54:29] six so when we pull up all these quotes
[1:54:31] about gifts of the Spirit do we not know
[1:54:34] there's six more included in that
[1:54:39] yes for our church I don't want just
[1:54:42] tongues interpretation or prophecy I
[1:54:46] want Discerning of
[1:54:49] spirits which will be two or three
[1:54:51] Witnesses that will discern when
[1:54:53] somebody's speaking in tongues and then
[1:54:56] they'll sign their name on it amen and
[1:54:59] say tell brother Dave tomorrow not to go
[1:55:01] to that certain job that he's got set
[1:55:03] because coming through there'll be a an
[1:55:05] American propane truck come through
[1:55:07] about 12:00 and if he's there it's going
[1:55:09] to blow up and it'll blow that whole
[1:55:11] house where he's at tell him not to go
[1:55:13] thus sayeth the Lord
[1:55:15] amen and then it's laid up on the
[1:55:17] platform here this way the prophet Tau
[1:55:19] it I know we don't want it wonder if
[1:55:22] that's one of them words wonder if
[1:55:24] that's one of them
[1:55:26] words that somehow we think we have a
[1:55:29] superior understanding to than our
[1:55:32] Prophet messenger brother sister when we
[1:55:35] head that way we're headed for trouble
[1:55:37] that's right I don't care how long
[1:55:40] you've preached how much you've sung
[1:55:42] shouted jumped jerked whatever you've
[1:55:44] done who in the world in this message
[1:55:46] thinks they have got more understanding
[1:55:49] than the prophet messenger that God sent
[1:55:51] to bring us this way
[1:55:54] m
[1:55:56] m let me close with this seeds on air
[1:56:00] with a shock once a carrier of a true
[1:56:02] word
[1:56:04] justification then it became a carrier
[1:56:07] of
[1:56:08] sanctification then it became a carrier
[1:56:12] of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:56:16] restoration of the gifts but then when
[1:56:19] he goes on and keeps going back
[1:56:23] try to eat something Mana from another
[1:56:30] day it's rotten it's no good a genuine
[1:56:35] Eagle of this day
[1:56:37] knows that was all
[1:56:40] right but we got
[1:56:42] that plus amen I'm sorry well no I ain't
[1:56:47] sorry actually you're not keeping from
[1:56:49] me my pluses amen you're not going to
[1:56:52] hem me up on justification saying we
[1:56:53] ain't going no farther I've done been
[1:56:55] farther than that you ain't going to hem
[1:56:57] me up on sanctification and you
[1:56:59] certainly ain't going to H me up on
[1:57:00] gifts and say well this is the light of

[1:58:10] thing that's this man right here and
[1:58:12] this one right here when they were
[1:58:14] traveling the other day and they were
[1:58:16] delivering some disaster relief to the
[1:58:18] flood deal and all that come back to

[1:58:28] does why same Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost

[1:58:41] not looking for a man to tell me what my

[1:58:47] word discern my very heart let that word
[1:58:51] discern you what does it do it brings
[1:58:53] his presence right down where we are do
[1:58:55] we believe in

[1:59:00] gifts I want in our
[1:59:03] church

[1:59:11] until Jesus Christ is
[1:59:15] Manifest in the fullness of his
[1:59:20] power I'll get to you I'm on a detour I
[1:59:22] know you don't know it but I'm on a
[1:59:26] detour but where the Prophet said that
[1:59:28] the fullness of the son of man will be
[1:59:32] among his
[1:59:33] people in the last
[1:59:37] day
[1:59:39] deity the
[1:59:41] fullness of the godhead
[1:59:45] bodily on the earth in the form of a
[1:59:49] bread so no I'm not stopping at
[1:59:54] justification I'm not stopping at the
[1:59:56] restoration of
[1:59:58] gifts I want the
[2:00:01] giver
[2:00:04] amen I've got to go further back than
[2:00:06] isusa Street I've experienced ausa
[2:00:09] Street and I wasn't satisfied I've
[2:00:12] shouted I've run I've
[2:00:15] danced brother Chuck Dixon and I were
[2:00:17] sitting in a location a certain night
[2:00:19] under a tent
[2:00:24] a very strange presence come on the
[2:00:25] platform everybody else was gone
[2:00:28] remember brother Chuck was sitting
[2:00:29] there I seen an angel of the Lord walk
[2:00:33] around the outside perimeter of the tent
[2:00:35] tent was rolled up my hair stood upon
[2:00:38] the back of my neck like
[2:00:42] that and I seen him standing out there
[2:00:45] the spirit of God spoke to me and said
[2:00:48] go meet him
[2:00:53] I said Lord I'm
[2:00:56] afraid I said brother Chuck I just seen
[2:00:58] an angel of the
[2:01:00] Lord I've got to go out and
[2:01:03] pray brother Chuck said Lord have mercy
[2:01:05] brother
[2:01:06] Donnie he got down on the platform hit
[2:01:09] his face like
[2:01:13] this on out found a solitary
[2:01:17] place where the presence of God come I
[2:01:20] was a Pentecostal
[2:01:24] he told me something about my Ministry
[2:01:26] and things that would happen I've
[2:01:28] experienced that but why did it leave me
[2:01:32] hungry why did it leave me
[2:01:36] searching I saw a little Carside boy one
[2:01:38] time come up for prayer I laid my hands
[2:01:40] on him I watched almighty God straighten
[2:01:42] his eyes out straight as they could be I
[2:01:45] did it leave be Hunger for More
[2:01:52] don't just give me one word two words
[2:01:55] three
[2:01:56] words give me the
[2:01:59] volume of the
[2:02:02] book
[2:02:10] amen Lord
[2:02:14] Jesus help us to that
[2:02:20] father Lord God God we we thank you for
[2:02:24] what what we've experienced and what
[2:02:27] we've
[2:02:29] had Lord we don't want to stop with one
[2:02:32] word or two
[2:02:35] words
[2:02:36] oh those experiences that I've had and
[2:02:39] some of them I've had Lord I'll never
[2:02:41] repeat because they're just meant for me
[2:02:43] and you to
[2:02:46] know but yeah Lord the ones I've had
[2:02:48] have been
[2:02:50] wonderful but Jesus Jesus I still
[2:02:53] crave a hunger a
[2:02:57] thirst and I read a statement the other
[2:03:00] day where your Prophet said what we need
[2:03:02] so much in the
[2:03:03] church is a
[2:03:06] Revival of
[2:03:09] love I've thought oh my
[2:03:12] goodness is this part of that
[2:03:16] Capstone a Revival of Love setting down
[2:03:20] on the bride
[2:03:23] right before she goes
[2:03:26] away help us
[2:03:29] Jesus add to our justification add to
[2:03:33] our
[2:03:34] sanctification add to our restoration of
[2:03:38] gifts word upon top of word on top of
[2:03:43] word justification made way for
[2:03:47] sanctification sanctification made way
[2:03:51] for the bap baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for
[2:03:56] the Holy Ghost
[2:03:59] itself it's amazing that the prophet
[2:04:02] said there was something more that he
[2:04:04] had to preach to his church he preached
[2:04:06] many them great sermons The Seals and
[2:04:09] Christ of mystery warning then judgment
[2:04:10] all that and he said now there's
[2:04:12] something more there's another step for
[2:04:17] this
[2:04:18] church and that was the token
[2:04:23] oh
[2:04:25] Jesus we love your
[2:04:28] signs we love your
[2:04:31] Miracles oh God I long to see more of
[2:04:35] them but Lord God I not going to
[2:04:39] Major on just healings and deliverances
[2:04:42] and signs and
[2:04:44] wonders God I want people that are so in
[2:04:47] love with you and so in love with each
[2:04:49] other Lord God that people can talk
[2:04:52] about them and run them down and
[2:04:53] whatever and they're so full of the love
[2:04:55] of God that they're praying for
[2:04:58] forgiveness let's talk about being like
[2:05:01] Jesus then Judas could heal like you but
[2:05:05] he couldn't love like you oh Jesus help
[2:05:10] me to love like
[2:05:12] you help me to forgive like you help me
[2:05:15] Lord to draw a bigger Circle it seems
[2:05:18] that as we go on in time let's message
[2:05:22] people are getting better and better and
[2:05:24] better at drawing smaller
[2:05:27] circles instead of bigger ones and we
[2:05:30] sure didn't get that from our Prophet
[2:05:33] messenger cuz men told him they were
[2:05:35] drawing him out and he said whenever you
[2:05:37] do Brothers I'll just draw you right
[2:05:40] back
[2:05:42] in people don't have to draw us out
[2:05:44] anymore we'll draw them out and throw
[2:05:46] them
[2:05:46] out forgive us
[2:05:49] God help us to get out from under this
[2:05:52] sectarian
[2:05:53] anointing in the last days Lord
[2:05:57] Jesus help us
[2:06:00] God lord I've been wondering and
[2:06:02] thinking about all this flood relief and
[2:06:06] I've heard so many different testimonies
[2:06:08] of people in our community and people
[2:06:11] from Elizabeth and Johnson City and
[2:06:13] different
[2:06:14] ones I heard another one yesterday
[2:06:18] people that had heard all kinds of
[2:06:20] things about us criticized us and said
[2:06:23] this and that even one
[2:06:25] man said the Lord rebuked him for things
[2:06:30] that he had said about us cuz he found
[2:06:33] out what he had said and what he had
[2:06:34] heard wasn't even the truth some of the

[2:06:40] said so
[2:06:42] Lord let our light
[2:06:45] shine let them see
[2:06:47] Jesus let them Feel Jesus when around
[2:06:53] Lord oh hallelujah we're not handing out

[2:07:18] Hallelujah let them sense it Lord Jesus
[2:07:22] Jesus let our light so shine father I
[2:07:27] pray we worship you tonight
[2:07:31] Lord you didn't say by this shall all
[2:07:34] men know that you are my disciples
[2:07:36] because you cast out
[2:07:37] Devils because you have Miracles because
[2:07:40] you said in Matthew 24 they'll come
[2:07:42] before you in that day and say they've
[2:07:44] done all that and I'll say to them
[2:07:45] depart from me I never knew you but you
[2:07:49] said by this shall all men know that you
[2:07:52] are my
[2:07:53] disciples because you have such
[2:07:57] love it's
[2:07:59] recorded by some of Nero's historians
[2:08:02] and some of those and the other Emperors
[2:08:05] that when they would bring the
[2:08:07] Christians to burn them to kill
[2:08:10] them they kept commenting about the love
[2:08:14] they had not only for each other but for
[2:08:18] their
[2:08:19] enemies so before before they would
[2:08:22] light the Torches and set some of our
[2:08:25] brothers and sisters on
[2:08:27] fire our brothers and sisters would bow
[2:08:30] their heads and pray for their
[2:08:34] forgiveness they would put sheep
[2:08:38] scans on their
[2:08:40] children and turn them loose in the
[2:08:43] Coliseum and turn the dogs the leopards
[2:08:47] the
[2:08:48] Lions loose on their little children
[2:08:52] dressed up like
[2:08:54] sheep and make them parents stand there
[2:08:56] and watch
[2:08:58] it and then parents would bow their
[2:09:01] heads and pray for their
[2:09:05] forgiveness and we wonder why we're not
[2:09:07] any closer to
[2:09:08] you if somebody does something to us
[2:09:12] we'll never forgive them we'll hold a
[2:09:15] grudge against him the rest of our
[2:09:18] life and say we're restored I
[2:09:22] wonder Jesus help us
[2:09:25] God we hold things against people and
[2:09:28] get
[2:09:30] bitter and then say we're
[2:09:32] bright and our brothers and sisters had
[2:09:35] to watch their babies brains be beat
[2:09:38] out wives watch their husband's guts be
[2:09:41] tore from their
[2:09:43] bodies and pray for their enemies and we
[2:09:47] say we've got the same Holy
[2:09:49] Ghost and if people people cross us we
[2:09:52] cut them off won't have nothing to do
[2:09:55] with
[2:09:56] them forgive us
[2:09:59] Lord forgive us
[2:10:02] Lord anybody willing to say that with me
[2:10:05] tonight forgive us Lord for
[2:10:09] us forgive
[2:10:12] us teach us how to love
[2:10:17] Jesus we worship you father
[2:10:22] we bless your name
[2:10:25] Lord oh

[2:10:30] in the
[2:10:33] presence of the God who is
[2:10:40] love thank you
[2:10:43] Lord teach us how to
[2:10:46] live in
[2:10:49] love and dwell
[2:10:52] in the land of
[2:10:54] love oh we'd rather dwell in the land of
[2:10:56] the Miracles and the signs and the
[2:10:58] Wonders or the financial blessings and
[2:11:01] live in the land of the material live in
[2:11:04] the land of
[2:11:07] Lea as Carol and I saw a video on
[2:11:11] YouTube the other day of Russia's new
[2:11:17] bomb called
[2:11:19] Satan to
[2:11:23] they can send it from Russia to any
[2:11:26] place around the
[2:11:29] world in 30 minutes and
[2:11:34] under it can have multiple Warheads up
[2:11:37] to 15 Warheads on one
[2:11:42] missile 500 times the
[2:11:46] power that was on the bomb that was
[2:11:49] dropped on Hiroshima
[2:11:52] and
[2:11:55] Nagasaki
[2:11:58] Hypersonic and so far we have nothing to
[2:12:00] catch it or stop
[2:12:03] it and they can control each of those
[2:12:07] Warheads so they send it up above the
[2:12:09] Earth's atmosphere in an arc way above
[2:12:13] her radar can read
[2:12:15] it and then they bring it straight down
[2:12:17] and when they come down so far say over
[2:12:19] Central States
[2:12:22] they can designate one head to go War of
[2:12:25] the Warhead to go to New York another of
[2:12:28] remember all
[2:12:30] nuclear one to go to Los Angeles one to
[2:12:32] go to Colorado one to go here one to go
