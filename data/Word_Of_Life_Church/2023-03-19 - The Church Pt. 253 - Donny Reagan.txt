grateful dear God for parents and desire to bring children into the Earth Lord they have a desire to not only give life but to be able to raise them in the way that when this life is over they can enter in with sin into eternity Heavenly Father we're asking today that you would just be with him Lord he said a lot of battles already in his life but Jesus we've seen you bring him through one after the other he can't even talk yet hardly can't even hardly do anything for himself but he's already experienced the power of God in his life we bring him to you today Father which is pray that you'd watch over him and keep him no matter what Satan would try to bring against him may your great hand be with him Lord give his father the wisdom the ability to instruct him and guide him his mother the fifth the gospel I pray that you would help her a father that she can be able to imprint upon him what a real godly woman is like we bring him to you today and we dedicated his life to you

wisdom and strength know how father razor trainer and teacher Lord we're just praying that your presence would just be with her Lord being a little girl that's going to be a lot aimed at her I know that Satan loves to aim it at the women in this day so many Fashions so many things to try to affect them but we also know Lord that whenever it's all said and done the sisters will have a great reward because in many ways they've overcome much more than the men have so I pray that your keeper she would get old enough to be able to no rhyme from wrong deal with her heart while she's young and tender but she can give her heart to you give them wisdom and strength to be able to know how to raise her teacher and the admonition of God we dedicate her to you father today for a life of service in Jesus name [Applause] stand again love of Jesus today praise the Lord that's awesome let's turn if you would to the book of First Kings chapter 22. verse 5. First Kings chapter 22 verse 5 read a few verses there I want you to listen carefully now to our setting today and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel inquire I pray thee at the word of the Lord today but this time in the scripture the kingdom had been divided into two sects to divisions in the land of Israel one of them was still called Israel and the other one was called Judah Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah and Ahab of course being the king of Israel so the syrians are approaching them and they're going to have a war Jehoshaphat has been asked by Ahab to come and join ranks with him Jehoshaphat was a real believer Ahab but something else that's for sure but Jehoshaphat still even though it entered into his compromising Union with this make-believing so-called message person he still had enough about him to know that the Lord's way was important and so he says Joshua sinner the king of Israel inquire I praise thee at the word of the Lord today I want you to notice how this is spelled capital L capital O capital r capital D verse 6. then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men wow 400 Hebrew prophets not heathens Hebrew Prophets and said unto them shall I go against Ramos Gilead to battle or shall I forebear and they said go up for the Lord but look at how this one's spelled capital L little o little r Little D now this is the Hebrew word which is also used for Baal Jehoshaphat was not interested in what Baal had to say he was interested in capital l or Rd which is Jehovah or Yahweh but now these guys watch what they're saying the Lord will be with you or the Lord will give it into your hand capital L small o smaller small d so it kind of makes you wonder where these guys are look at their message it is a message of compromise and they said go up for the Lord shall deliver it now the word it is not actually in the original watch these guys how deceiving they are for the Lord shall deliver leave it out unto the hand of the king but I want you to notice they don't say which king or what's actually going to be delivered so it's a more Universal prophecy that whoever wins this battle they're going to win either way because they asked you didn't say Ahab you were going to win but they said the Lord will deliver but deliver what deliver Ramos Gilead deliver the syrians deliver what sounds like some of the modern day prophets we've got today in it there's somebody here in the building today that's got a pain yeah who ain't oh I feel somebody's got a burden yeah who ain't that's the kind of prophets these guys were go up for the Lord shall delivered unto the king to the hand of the king and Jehoshaphat said is they're not here a prophet of the capital L capital O capital r capital D now wait a minute we've got 400 Hebrew Prophets but there's something about these old boys just didn't ring right it just didn't sound right didn't feel right it's just something was wrong so Jehoshaphat said is or not a prophet of the Lord besides that we might inquire of him and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat there is yet one man IA the son of emblem by whom we may inquire the Lord now even this backslidden King knew who had the word but I hate him yeah that's a sign he's a good man of God right there but I hate him for he does not prophesy good concerning me well how could he but evil and Jehoshaphat said oh let not the king say so I'd like to be remembered as we pray today Heavenly fathers we bow our heads we're asking you Lord that you would take your word and speak to us father I have my hands on these prayer clothes that sister Ruth Ann Carter sent the request for her family members Lord you know these needs and you're aware of them today and I lay my hands on them and I will wear them and while you're anointing is here today I pray in the name of Jesus that you would go to these needs and these requests there were hundreds of hands that were uplifted across this building today signifying needs desires petitions we ask that you would help us speak to us today by your word may our faith be increased to where we can ask and believe and watch you manifest yourself in our midst today in the name of the Lord Jesus the word we pray amen God bless you you may be seated look with me if you were to verse 11. so now there's 400 of these Prophets they are Hebrews they are message preachers we'll say so they're not prophets of Baal they're not prophets of some other false god but they are compromising Prophets and they're going to tell this King what he wants to hear because it's the type of prophets that they are and he knew that that's why I asked for them first and a Jehoshaphat would not have asked for a real servant of God no doubt Ahab would have never even mentioned his name but because Jehoshaphat even though he was kind of fellowshipping around Ahab and hanging around in him some and you know just been a friend and a buddy and a pal and however you want to say it but yet he still knew that God had a way and he wanted to be right this man wanted to be right before the Lord so let's pick up in verse 11. and zedekiah the son of kinea made him horns of iron I remember prophets use symbols remember one of the prophets of the Old Testament uh made a yoke Jeremiah another one would take and dig a hole through a wall and he would lay on his side for so many days and then turn over and lay on his other side so this false prophet what he decided to do was to use a symbol and a sign so notice what he does he made him horns of iron so he goes and he hand crafts these horns and he brings them up maybe sticks them up on the side of his head here he comes maybe he's pawing around and snorting and boy he really puts on some drama my all the people are sitting there looking at him and waiting to hear what he's got to say and he says thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord now watch him capital L capital O capital r capital D now he is more deceiving than the others he moves in to the channel that he knows Jehoshaphat wants to hear now he puts his horns up will say thus saith the Lord with these Thou shalt push the Assyrians until they have thou hath consumed them now this old boy Ventures a little further than the rest of the 400. now he's gonna go down into a realm to where something has moved on him that apparently is somewhat different than the others he's going to bring the prophecy more personal he's going to absolutely stand up and swear a lie against Jehovah God Prophet says it this way any man that says thus saith the Lord and the Lord didn't say it that man deserves to go to hell that's quite a statement is it not now notice he says Thou shalt take these horns and you'll push the syrians plum back oh boy he calls these other gods to Rally I'm telling you what they started feeling something brother Donnie do you think they felt something I am a hundred percent convinced these people were feeling something and they were feeling a spirit but it just wasn't the Holy Ghost now notice what the Bible says and all the prophets prophesied so so here now they've got a leader the others are more generic more General but a leader stands up a leader prophet and whenever he becomes specific then they become specific so he said by these horns you'll run them out well all the rest of these guys they didn't have horns but they just maybe give up and stick up their their fingers like you glory to God hallelujah glory to God the saith the Lord you're gonna write them out go up to Ramos Gilead and prosper for the Lord now notice here they've changed their word too capital L capital O capital r capital T just a couple of verses prior to this they were not saying this word but what did they do they modified in their deception so if you all want to hear capital L capital O capital r capital D we really don't believe Jehovah is this but if that's what you all need to hear us say we will change our sermon [Music] so you will think we believe let me tell you something friend if you don't have the Holy Ghost today I'm warning you as a servant of God you better get it before it's too late because the deception in the last days is going to be so strong and so powerful that only the elected will escape the power of this hour that we're in although I've been around the message I don't care how long you've been around the message you don't withstand deception by Years Around the word there's only one way to do it sealed by the author of the word now my thought today again is what we went along the lines of last Sunday whose report will you believe now it's a little bit different than Sunday but we'll just give me a little bit of time here and the messenger now notice so they go to get this other guy Micah and the messenger that was called to call Micah spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one Mouse they're all saying the same thing because I was right there and I heard them say it let Thy word I praise it be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good because we're all on TV and they're all on radio and they're all on podcasts and they're all saying the same thing America is fixing to have a Revival I mean we're fixing to give our hearts back to God and the Russians is going to be blowed away don't worry about the Russians they'll never get to us we're the Great Mighty America you better not listen to that lie America is doomed I said America is doomed the prophet didn't even pray for as a nation before he left how much worse is she today are there individuals that can still be saved yes but our nation is beyond Redemption friends but of course that's not what they want to hear they want to hear that God is going to turn it all around again and our nation's going to come right back to God oh sure I agree there will be many many people that will think they're getting saved after the Rapture after the bride is done gone when The Mercy Seat is totally empty of blood there will not be one Speck of Blood On The Mercy Seat nor will God hear any sinner's prayer for repentance and yet they will be crying like never before Baptist Churches Methodist churches message churches that miss the Rapture all kinds of churches will be a people will be thwarting and why shouldn't they hailstones will be falling out of Heaven that'll weigh a hundred pounds apiece the prophets will stand Moses and Elijah and they'll call fire out of Heaven they'll call hail they'll call for whatever they want it will scale the liver out of people people will go to church they will scream they will run to God they will be reading their Bible they'll be doing like they've never done before except too late whose report are you going to believe today that's the question now notice so this guy kind of drops a bug in his ears we would say but he's talking to the wrong fella here and Micah said as the Lord live us what the Lord says unto me that will I speak now notice in verse 15 as he goes into this so he came to the king now he's already got this warning now we're just giving you a little bit of notice up front there pal you've been disassociated for a long time everybody kind of looks at you as being a relegated y'all hear by yourself look there's 400 men and they're all saying the same thing who in the world do you think you are anyhow one little old scrapping guy that's out here by himself you have no recognition among the big denominational heads why you don't even get invited to preach conventions no more they don't love you they don't care for you and yet you feel like you're the only ones right why look man get some reason get some sense you're getting a little bit of age on you you're going to need a little Medicaid and a little Medicare and a little bit of Social Security and a little bit of retirement join in with us we'll put you on a friendship he said I'll not say nothing but what the Lord tells me to say God give us such men today so he came to the king and the King said unto him my cup shall we go up against Ramos Gilead to battle or shall we forebear and he answered him go and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it and to the hand of the king oh my goodness so he's saying the same thing the false prophets said he did out of scorn he's actually making fun of them and the king oh but now wait a minute what if there were some of these believe the sign people that would have been in the days of Micah and then they would have took this statement and then took the next statement which I'm fixing to read to you and say right here Micah said one thing and right over here he said something else now this is in your Bible if you don't apply the same standard to this Prophet that you do to our Elijah in this day it means you're a hypocrite and a liar and the church said all right now notice he answered him go and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king did you notice in reading this he says identical the same thing then Prophet said word for word so he does an answer but notice he doesn't say this in the name of the Lord he doesn't say thus saith the Lord thus speaketh the Lord he doesn't even say it in his own face but he says it out of scorn and ridicule I watch this and the King said unto him now you say how can you how can you say that he done that because the king himself when he heard this sound this demeanor and he hears the sound of his voice he knows immediately he ain't telling him right and the King said unto him how many times how many times shall I assure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord now we don't want to hear it but he gets mad when he don't hear it how can you help people like that believe me I deal with them all the time they want you to tell them the truth until you tell them the truth and then when you tell them the truth they got mad that you told them the truth so what's a preacher supposed to do I'll tell you what he's supposed to do tell you the truth anyway and then if you don't like it well you'll meet it at the day of judgment oh my God how many times shall I jury thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true In The Name Of The Lord and he said I saw Saul now he breaks into the fourth dimension and tells us his vision I saw all Israel scattered upon the Hills as sheep that have not a shepherd now he's giving us the word of the Lord not scorn not ridicule but the vision and the Lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat did not I tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil all right now we're not in 2023 any longer we're back in First Kings 22. and you all have just heard 400 prophets prophesy to the king you've heard another one come up with horns and then you've heard this other guy come up and say I saw Israel scattered like sheep having no Shepherd so which report are you going to believe her brother how will I know it's really quite simple it's not that hard you judge what they're saying take it back to the word now what did the word say before the Prophet Elijah said that God would feed this man and the dogs would lick his blood and the dogs would eat Jezebel's body so he checked his vision by the word but could the 400 chapters by the word they couldn't they wouldn't they should not they'd lose their pension they lose their setting at the table of the king now these guys were very privileged because they were able to sit around the table of the king and there was kind of his pets as we would say so he bought him a new Chariot every now and then and give them a new horse every now and then and kind of kept them really good so if he wanted to look real religious before the rest of Israel he'd call the prophet Sam hey come on guys come on in tell me a good word from the Lord what go on up Old King Hallelujah you're just the Blessed of the Lord and I'm the smiley preacher from Texas and God loves you so much and we're not preaching against nobody and we're not going to blast nobody if that man don't get saved he'll burn in hell I'm telling you what every preacher that stands up and knows the truth and will not tell it to the people will be lost one day till you realize them people in the regions of the Lost are going to be hunting for preachers do you know what they're going to do when they get down and that regions of the Lost they're going to be looking for them preachers that led them astray and preached ever and Damned their soul to hell I don't want nobody looking for me and he said here therefore the word of the Lord I saw the Lord sitting on his throne now notice Micah I call true Prophets he's not a trinitarian so he didn't say I thought I saw three Thrones and there was an old man and there was a younger man and there was a spirit being sitting over there but like John he saw one throne and one who said on it I saw the Lord sitting on his shoulder all the hosts of Heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his land now this is the true epitome of Heaven not a miniature God an amateur God a younger God and an old God but God himself and the host on the right hand and the host on the left hand and the Lord said who shalt persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ramos Gilead now listen friends what we're dealing with and one sat on this manner and another set on that manner and there came forth a spirit now listen it was a fallen angel which come up out of hell so he comes up out of the regions of the Lost Before the Throne of God and said I will persuade him now here is a being that one time stood in the presence of God and worshiped God and adored God and magnified God but of course Satan split them in heaven and this was one of them that followed the split from the Holy Angels to those who lost their estate so Jude says so they followed the devil and now he comes up out of hell can you imagine he comes up and says hey you need me to do something for you is there anything that I could do so here comes this lying Spirit out of hell oh my Lord and he says I will persuade him and the Lord said unto him we're with and he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all look at the word ah All His prophets even that devil recognized that them prophets was not speaking the word of the Lord but they were ahab's possession friends could you really respect me could you really respect any man of God that will preach only what you want to hear could you really respect any servant of God that knows if you've got sin in your life and you would honestly rather he didn't deal with that to make you feel better there's something wrong with you if you feel that way oh sure it may hurt our feelings and trample all over our feet I'd rather preacher tear me up one side and down the other and spare me out of hell instead of tipping my ear NOW Watch What Happens and he said Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail also go for us and do so so here comes this lying spirit and it comes down there and gets in the mouths of these false prophet message preachers so no doubt they're saying that glory to God feel it all over there's not a question in my mind they felt something all over them and no doubt they felt led check what you feel led to do by God's word God will never lead any of us contrary listen to this and the anointed ones the end time the prophet said a lying Spirit come up out of hell and fell down on his knees and said if you will permit me I can give them my anointing now here is a lying spirit so the lying Spirit comes and gets in the mouths of these prophets and surrenders his anointing and now they're standing there prophesying lies with the anointing of a demon and now remember you're the people sitting there you're sitting there hearing these men so what would you have said what would you have done what would have been your response when the 400 said Co-op go up and then there's one emotional God runs the pebble's horns on over his head oh man a spirit fill the place and the people oh yes yes I feel it I know this is God I know it is I wonder how many of us we're gonna say yes yes and you would have joined your ranks with a demonic anointing you say this is scary brother Donnie you better believe it's scary how can we know for sure how can we know we won't be deceived we stay with his word I can give them my anointing now notice how brother Brandon paraphrases this scenario make them do any kind of sign or wonder you mean a lying devil a lying Spirit can get on people and they will actually prophesy lies and perform Miracles too we'll be judging by their signs you're already on your way to deception you don't judge a man by signs wonders miracles you judge them by the word of God we believe in signs wonders miracles do we not but we believe the word has preeminence over every gift remember your Prophet says in Harvest Time December the 27th 1964 Satan can hand out those spiritual gifts by the handfuls you imagine the devil having access to hand out spiritual gifts by the handfuls praise the Lord I can give them my anointing make them do any kind of sign or wonder now this is what he wants to do just as long as I can get them off the word he won't even know that that is your word he'll ignore it for popularity brother times hasn't changed y'all to hear Brother random's voice haven't listened this in a while y'all too you ought to hear Brother Brown's voice as he hollers this out and expresses it and then he speaks directly to brother Neville brother Neville that's true remember that's true I don't think them words it's just for brother Neville I think for the word of Life church today I believe they're forever message church around the world Satan is on the prowl oh my I'll get upon him and make him do the same things the rest of them does I'll make him prophesy and tell a lie how could it be a lie he says because it was contrary to the word now here's Micah again in verse 23 now therefore behold the Lord has put a lying spirit and the mouth of all these thy Prophets oh and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee zedekiah the son of Chennai went near and smelt Micah on the cheek and said which way did the spirit of the Lord for me to speak unto thee and Micah said behold Thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go unto an inner chamber to hide thyself whose report will you believe so we got a whole congregation over here 400. glory to God hallelujah I feel it all over me praise the Lord go up go up revivals in the land it's coming it's coming it's coming revival is here no judgment is here and we've got one little guy standing over here what seems to be by himself now just by counting numbers which one would you sideways oh you said that that's history no this event is history but the same thing is actually going on again today it's going on in our church it's going on in every other message church around the world people are going to decide whose report will they believe are they going to believe the report of the Lord are they going to believe a report that sounds like the report of the Lord remember our twin will not come quoting Billy Graham I have twin will not come quoting other men of great great Renown our twin will quote the same Prophet you quote and the church said if you can't say Amen say ouch all at least know you're alive okay now notice the king of Israel said take Micah and carrying back to am on the governor of the city and to joest the King's son and say thus saith the king bless God I'll show him thus saith again put this fell into prison and feed him with bread of Affliction I'm with a water of Affliction until I come in peace Micah said if thou return at all in peace the Lord hath not spoken by me and he said hearken all people so now he knew Ahab is not going to listen but then what does he do he pleads to the people listen people hearken people yeah I imagine alarms crazy guy why knucklehead who in the world is going to believe a radical type of a guy like that my goodness I want the kind old priest type of Pastor that lets you do whatever you want to do and live any way you want to live well you know God don't look at the outside an old an old barn needs a new coat of paint I agree Barnes do but women's faces don't paint your barn just don't paint your wife well praise the Lord why what difference does it make if you wear a mini skirt or don't don't you know where Richard what difference does it make it if men dress in women's clothes it's an abomination in the eyes of our God well come on now Saints well brother Donnie what difference does it make if a man marries a man or a woman marries a woman because that's not the original plan show me where God ever ordained such and I'll marry one next week but since the Lord God made man and woman and he didn't marry Adam and Steve but he married Adam and Eve he did not marry marry together Eve and Mary or even Jane but it was Adam and Eve together and that's the way I plan on keeping it as long as I marry folks in this church now I know some folks don't like it they don't want to hear it preached you see any care in these eyes I'm going to stand before God one day and when I do I want to be able to walk up there and say Lord God I stood for the truth I was hated I was despised I was rejected I want to hear him say come on in Donnie I'm proud of you you stood for me in the evil day anybody want to go in with me and you might want to say yes Lord we believe the report of the lord we also bore that chain we for the reproach and we're so glad we did [Applause] so just hold it in your mind now so what if you would have said in that day I believe those men are telling the truth those 400. and then a true prophet of God identifies that voice is from hell would you been man or woman enough to admit that you were wrong and you were misled the honors quiet as a bunch of Church of Christ this morning you see it takes a big man a big woman to be able to admit they were wrong and that they were actually the influence of a demon well praise the Lord and if you can find a preacher that'll say he was under the influence of a demon you have found a real prize well I felt led to do this I'm not saying preachers don't feel led to do various things but what I like to do is trace it back to the word and see if they're leading is coinciding with the word well there's preachers around the world that are feeling led to set down and quit preaching and just push oh now if you can show me where God's Prophet ever said any such thing beginning Wednesday night we will turn this into a push play Church show me anywhere the Bible Institute such or God's Prophet said it'll come to pass after I'm gone that the best way to have the perfect word is for every preacher to sit down I don't blame the devil If I Was the Devil I'd want all them Holy Ghost filled preachers to sit down too that gives me a greater desire to preach instead of shut up it gives me a greater desire to burn his hide from Hades and back because I know how he hates true anointed men of God how he hates men of God in their home he don't want to just shut the preachers up he wants to shut you fathers up he wants to shut you mothers up don't get your mind just on the preacher part if he can shut the preachers down then your next move into the home and he'll shut the daddies up oh Father quit telling them what to do no brothers tell your children instruct them the way they ought to Live come on children mothers instruct your daughters how they ought to dress how they ought to live how are they on the wall why because your voice is a dying voice as far as the world is concerned but as long as we're alive God will have people on the Earth that will never compromise we will never we are outnumbered we are outnumbered as far as the world goes but as far as heaven heaven is on our side so before we move to Jeremiah I ask you again whose report do you believe Jeremiah chapter 20 verse 9 then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name poor Jeremiah he's one of my favorite of all the Old Testament prophets but I feel so sorry for him and the sense of reading about his life and all that the man went through he was treated terrible absolutely terrible and Jeremiah just got to a spot to where he said I can't take it no more I just can't handle it I've tried to stand for what's right I've tried to do what's right people don't want it you give them your life they turn and walk away from you don't even have a common respect to come and talk to you and say they love you I really don't care for love that way you give people your life you lose sleep over them you sweat over them you labor over them you lead them to Gods you lead them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they get tired of you and they'll turn and go the other way and never even come and speak to you about it and that's the kind of people of Integrity this message produces if that is I quit today but you see the true message I produce such stuff notice so Jeremiah says I'll not make no mention of him nor speak anymore in his name I can't take it then Jeremiah found a little key and he said his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing in other words I was weary of keeping my mouth shut so the people made him weary because he opened his mouth but he found out a secret God can make you more weary than the people can if you don't oh my and I could not stay now notice their report of what Jeremiah was hearing for I heard the defaming look at the word whispering defamation evil report unfavorable saying well I used to follow the messaging but I found out that brother Bram said this over here and that over there and I found that brother random was a human well you should have been listening to some true anointed preachers and they would have told you that already he never said he was a God or an angel he said he was a human being who made all kinds of mistakes I wish somebody would say Amen to that but they found out oh my they're they're the imagination of what they had was a prophet of their imagination and they took every word that he said is thus saith the Lord and then come and find out what he changed on this and he changed on that sure just like Paul did just like Moses did just like Joshua did just like all men do because no man is infallible I said no man is infallible Jeremiah says I heard the defaming of many and fear on every side Reports say they and we will report oh here we've got the report now so they're telling him you report and we'll report you we're going to turn you into the authorities you can't turn me into nobody hiring Jesus so go ahead and turn me in if you want to to him Reports say they and we will report it familiar from my halting and the word halting is limping and stumbling so you can imagine now you've got people just watching they're not watching for good they're not watching for benefit they're watching they're listening there's people that still listen to our services the same way they listen to Everything I preach trying to find fault trying to find error you think that don't put you under a burden you think they don't put you under strength but let me just speak to some of them spies this morning and say that's what I fear about you report me to YouTube if you want to report me to CBS and NBC and ABC they've already done it it didn't stop me did it it didn't stop us as the people of God so we say like Jeremiah we will report a yearly part but you will report defamation and lies and what will we report thus say is the Lord [Applause] it's all my familiars watched which was friends and Neighbors all my familiars watch for my halting or my limping saying pure Adventure he will be enticed and we shall Prevail against him and we shall take our revenge this is their report sort of like yours today of whatever you're going through you see friends times really hasn't changed that much your enemies are just by different names we don't have the enemies that Jeremiah did but it's the same demons out of hell and we shall take our revenge on him that was their report but listen to Jeremiah's report Jeremiah 20 and 11 but the Lord it's with me as a mighty terrible one as a mighty Gabor a mighty Captain a mighty warrior the Lord now Jeremiah said oh no I know that they're overwhelmingly I better not do it anymore I I just repent I pretend I'm so sorry I shouldn't have never said that and if he would have listened and listened like we do sometimes they don't even trying there ain't no need nobody loves you nobody appreciates you oh you fought this battle of sickness and this and that and the other you can believe that report if you want to or you can believe this report but the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one how many can raise your hand and say the Lord is with me the Lord is with me despite my failures despite my mistakes despite your mistakes and your shortcomings he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you that includes shortcomings that includes falling flat on your face [Music] [Applause] but the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutor shall stumble they're watching for me to stumble but actually the contrary wise is going to happen my persecutors are going to stumble they're looking to run me down but they're the ones going to be run down all night therefore shall my persecutor stumble and they shall not Prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not prosper they're Everlasting confusion whose report will you believe now we'll revert back now to round [Music] five let's see during this time frame here 586 5. well this is this is around 578 to 580 BC you're following the Prophet Jeremiah in his day you're a message believer as we call it your fault on the prophet so they're spying on you too they're watching everything you do and everything you say they're looking for your thoughts since you started following the message they hate you they despise you they run you down they look everything they can you say oh this is too much this is too much I can't take it I can't take it is that the side you're going to take well we're going to Rally behind Jeremiah or Daniel or David or Noah whoever it was in our day this day Elijah we're going to Rally behind that message and say we will bear the reproach we will stand if we have to stand by ourself we will stand because if we stand for him he will stand for us if we stand with them what will they do they will turn their backs on us that's what they'll do you don't want to sell out Jesus for the world you don't want to sell out Jesus for a compromising denominational system because they will turn their back on you laughs well praise the Lord let me just tell you today how God wants us to stand in this hour into the sermon title called the god call man the prophet said oh you sons of God move out into that sphere Yonder Fearless fear less is there anybody here today don't raise your hand but just ask yourself this question in your heart is there anybody that could say Beyond a shot of a doubt I'm totally Fearless today you'll see my hands up dear you see friends were living beneath what God wants God wants us to be Fearless how many has ever been moneyless okay you're with me now how many has ever been pretty less I'll say Brothers raise their hands on that well that's good I'm glad I didn't have no suppressified 65 million in here we've been all kinds of less things ain't we but there's one thing God wants us to be less fear less which means what we're less severe why we ain't got enough room in our hearts to have fear and faith together so if we're going to leave one of them out God says leave out fear be Fearless brother Donnie are you kidding me do I look like I'm kidding listen to this he goes on to say God today is trying to empty the world out of us and get us to empty ourselves out and be Fearless men and women oh praise the lord Jimmy not only the brothers no the sisters too who love God I must stay with God I cross the separating Line Jordan that he can use for his glory notice this it says hallelujah we know what we're going to at the end of this journey God is Promised amen there's a land beyond the river be Fearless in your testimony amen if it's revealed to you you are Fearless Fearless how many needs some things revealed to you today it's up here but why ain't we Fearless it ain't been revealed to us enough wonder why we don't spend enough time in prayer could it be we'd rather be playing basketball and football and soccer and this and that and the other than spending time with prayer God make me Fearless God make me a Fearless daughter God make me a Fearless teenage boy a teenage girl anybody here listening to me today is there anybody here that wants to be that type of a believer that you can look to devil in the face and say I shall not be moved Hallelujah like a tree planted by the water I am Fearless we looked at Little David facing Goliath with the sling and his Stone but let's look at him in another battle which is a little bit more difficult Psalm 3 1. a Psalm of David when he fled from Absalom his son Lord how are they increased that trouble me many are they that rise up against me now it's not a Goliath it's not even a Saul it's Absalom his son what does Absalom want his kingdom and it looks like for a little bit he would get it again now I say if y'all were living in the days of Absalom and King David whose side would you be on well some of y'all joined ranks with Absalom with some of the message people join ranks with Absalom they would they already have them [Music] against God's anointed king did the prophet anoint Absalom no was it through God's Divine Protocol no and yet the majority of the army and a great portion of the people of Israel with Jonah ranks with him it shows how ignorant that people can be and never ceases to amaze me how easily deceived sheep really are you thank the Lord Jesus called us sheep as a compliment you need to study the life of a sheep a little bit better and you realize it was not so much a compliment it was an act a face in him recognizing that he was their Shepherd but also sharing how gullible how easily fleeced sheep can be how easily deceived that sheep can be and won't even check the word to see should I do this should I do that is it right to do this wrong to do that well don't sit there and look at me it's the truth notice so David is now had to leave Jerusalem and who's there in the capital his son his son Epsilon so David is now running again as it did in the days of Saul now we love this song Here of Psalm 3. but I guarantee you one thing David wasn't loving it whenever he was going through it Harry maybe there be would say of my soul there is no help for him in God can you imagine Israelites now these were not the moabites and the ammonites and the Hittites these were message people saying this about David there's no help for him the guys he's gone now remember what he had done taken Bathsheba there's no mercy fund the guys send away of deus Graves there's no more Mercy for the man at all there is no help for him in God but was that the way God felt about it it wasn't so all of them that said that lied over into a new move now wonder the move of Absalom got started baby God's going to displaced safe he's going to get rid of him we don't need Elijah no more they don't need the prophet of God no more we're in a new generation we don't need to have to stand himself with all the prophet said the prophet said we don't need all that we're in a new generation you may be speak for yourself I'm still staying with what a prophet has already said myself come on children somebody say Amen Let The Devil know whose side shown today somebody say Amen [Applause] all kinds of Elders too rulers captains of the people oh and David said many there be would say of my soul there is no help for him in God now this is their report it would have been very easy for David brother John to took their report and said well maybe there ain't he said brother Johnny what's that got to do with us everything every one of these examples I've used this morning you bring them right over into our day it's not going to be an Absalom so much it's not going to be a zedekiah it might be a cancer it might be blood pressure it might be a family member but don't you see they're going to work the exact same way they want you to say what they believe about you they don't want you to say what father believes about you so if they can get you to say what they say they will rob you of your victory well I can't be saved I can't be delivered I've sinned away I've done this and that and the other if that's what you choose to believe you will be lost but if you believe God is a merciful god if you'll believe that God can forgive you there is forgiveness for you but you will have to accept [Music] but I love this verse 3. but thou are the shield for me my glory and the lifter of my head now he's saying exact opposite what absalom's saying he's saying exact opposite of what the captains are saying and the sergeants are saying but he hadn't heard God saying what the sergeant was saying he hadn't heard God say what Absalom will say he still remembered what God Said I will make my Everlasting Covenant with you and my mercies will not forsake you as a matter of fact I will give you what God called the sure mercies of David first time in the Bible God ever identified mercies with a man and called mercies after a human servant the sure Mercies oh can you imagine David trying to encourage himself God's going to help me through this God's going to help me it must have been so discouraging so disheartening he leaves his crown he leaves his throne he leaves his concubines his son goes into his concubines and lays with them takes his father's Crown sets upon his father's throne and starts passing passing statutes and laws in the Kingdom as if he was the king David had to reach down find something Beyond this son something Beyond his generals found thou O Lord a shield for me notice in verse 4 I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me now you see many of us will say oh I cried and I cried they didn't hear me don't you say that again now when David says this nothing had happened yet but he says I know he loves me and I know he hears him I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his Holy Hill Salah I laid me down and slept well something must have happened now this must have been pretty outstanding brother felt no doubt David had had a lot of sleepless nights or he wouldn't have mentioned it this way now for those of you that go to bed in about 30 seconds you're gone would you please come and tell me after church what you do I would love to know I would give a hundred dollars a night sometimes to be able to do that to be able to lay down but my mind's going this way and that way and that way and the other way and I wake up at three and then I wake up at five then I wake up at six I think I might as well get up and then I'm dragging around all day and you look at me he's hungover and all that ain't hung over slept over I didn't get no sleep over the night oh hi David must have wrestled and David must have sweated it out but David said once God revealed to me that he's on my side what Absalom is saying is not what God said what the captains are saying is not what God said what the generals are saying is not what God Said but God said I love you David I laid me down and I awaked I know for some of you that don't really mean that much but if you don't sleep you can't awake so because David woke up it was a sign of victory how many woke up this morning oh while the rest of y'all didn't seek money either God bless your heart come see me after church we'll cry on one another's shoulders I laid me down and slept I awaked and this is why for the Lord sustain I will not be afraid of ten thousands now not ten thousand but ten thousands which is multiple bands of ten thousand so it could have been ten thousand plus another ten plus another ten plus another 10 plus another 10 because by now Absalom had gathered the great portion of the children of Israel against David now this is not Philistines this is not Hittites this is message for again I ask you whose report would you have believed would you have sneaked out of Jerusalem and left your business which you sneaked out of Jerusalem and left your bakery some of your brothers left your real estate some of your brothers left your cat converter truck oh boy that been a big step wouldn't it now David said I'm going to narrow pass or going up this mountain up to mount Getty in order to get up there that you'll have no room for that converted truck Brothers you ain't gonna have no room for that Bakery of yours you don't have no room for this and that it's going to be a dangerous route nearly all the armies of Israel is against us from Israel not six people [Music] David said I will not be afraid them thousands of people if a man could do this without the Holy Ghost hold up wait a minute that have set themselves against me round about let me share a few verses with you from my favorite Psalm one of my favorite one of the reasons this is one of my favorite because way back in the early 80s 81 82. Carol and I and Lisa was living in West Virginia Erica hadn't even been born when we first moved there we lived in a little house up a holler I was working my brother went Randy West we'd come in off of a trip I mean this place was terrible one of Carol's terrible times in her life having to stay at that place awful one night something attacked me I never did see it but I could feel it Carol began to pray list was just a little girl so her and Liz gathered around my bed and started praying and it was like I was battling for my life that's happened to me three or four times since I've been a Christian so I told Carol I said get your Bible and read Psalms 91 to me so they prayed her listen praying and crying and Carol got her Bible these are the words he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide Under The Shadow of the Almighty Hallelujah I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust you okay Donna Your Castle keep reading keep reading it didn't immediately leave but if she kept taking me down the path of Psalms 91. that thing lifted from my body and that darkness that was around me left the room verse 3 surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers under his wings shalt thou Trust his truth shall be thy shield and thy Buckler Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night nor for the era that flyest by day nor for the pestilence that walk Us in the darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come neither Hallelujah this is my report today this is who I am anybody else is this your report I will not be afraid of Leo to see a threat I will not be afraid oh my I read just yesterday and again today that North Korea has launched a missile that was in 33 minutes from the time of launch can land right in the middle of the United States of America and annihilate us I am not afraid of Kim Jong-un or young mon moon or any other Moon or Sun I am not afraid of Putin I am not afraid of Iran I am not afraid of death I am not afraid of Walking In the Valley of the shadow of death for the Lord is with me thyroid and thou comfort me hey that's the hour of fly by day let the pestilence come by night but I will not fear for the Lord is on our side foreign shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high habitation skip the scripture then Hebrews Brothers let me give you a couple more affirmations cause I place My Hope in God I can soar like an eagle run and not grow weary walk and not be faint Isaiah 40 and 31. I set my heart and my mind on things above not on Earthly things that gives me peace Colossians 3 1-2 I guard my heart because it determines the course of my life proverbs 4 23 I trust God at all times because he is my refuge Psalm 62 8 God keeps me in perfect peace because I trust in him and fix my thoughts on him Isaiah 26 3. somebody say amen God is able to do immeasurably more in my life than I can ever imagine Ephesians 3 hallelujah how many knows he can do it today oh my I experience true life and I deny myself turn from my selfish ways and follow Jesus Christ with all of my heart Matthew 16 24-25 I have the anointing of Jesus his anointing his power teaches me truths and empowers me to live a full life in other words I ain't going to just barely crawl in and fall into Heaven's Gates and say oh God ah I made it I want to go in like this well Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm here I'm here I made it I made it praise God and you all here want to be rolled in in a wheelchair this will be the Word of Life wheelchair section over here all of us were rolling with them y'all happy to be here that's what we'll do I may overcome are you glad you made it I'm just glad the devil's down in hell if you all do me that way I'm going to be some kind of embarrassed oh I'll tell you one thing I'll send a quote uh brother and send it to me yesterday and I'd shared with some other brothers his God and said please I don't even know how many times I've listened to that sermon and brother I'm talking about worshiping God he said we ought to go have come of that expectation and he said we ought to worship God right now like we're going to worship him then I thought Lord have mercy we ought to worship God right now like we're going to worship Him you mean this is the way y'all are going to do this is the way we're going to do we're sitting down you're just barely able to clap our hands and Nod our head and that's the way we're going to do heaven not me brother not me brother Joel oh I want to worship him with all of my heart I want to worship him with all of my strengths all of my might I don't know I have great joy Because I obey God Commandments and I remain in his love John 15 11. because I have written love and faithfulness on the tablet of my heart I have favor with God Proverbs 3 3. there's a bunch more but I want to save them until next week whose report you're going to believe your failures mistakes you're shortcomings the weaknesses doctor's report you're going to believe God's it's quite astounding you know when brother Brandon will tell people that if they had cancer he said he couldn't really bother you too bad unless you feared it that don't even make good sense well of course it don't because you're not processing the gospel through your head it comes to your heart a lot of Malachi four believers they got the message right up here but it's never moved from there to here all the word had quite a distance to travel from Heaven to the Earth it had quite a distance to reach the people all over the world in Malawi in Zimbabwe all the different islands of the world but the farthest distance at the head the heart the word of God has to travel is from here to here when we store it up here like a hard drive I've got so many terabytes of the message in my head it don't do a bit of good I'd rather have three or four megabytes down in my heart than three or four terabiths up in my head if we can get it down here look out devil here we come that's why I want to keep it right there and it keeps us paralyzed it keeps us full of fear full of anxiety I'm afraid to testify the last time I testified all hell broke loose that means y'all to testify again oh but I'm going to wait till they get here if I should like go ahead and testify right now but brother Donnie the doctor says I'm going to die go ahead and plan a vacation out to Arizona somewhere go ahead and look up a cruise on some ship are you going to believe the Lord's report are you going to believe what the devil says if I believe what the devil says I'll never preach again if I believe what the devil says I'll never open my mouth do you all want me to believe what the devil says Oh you mean you want me to believe what the Lord says but you choose to believe what the devil said I say we believe What God Says Are we more than conquerors Are we more than Overcomers can we Face this end time with victory in our hearts can we Face it with a smile on our face and the joy of the Lord down inside of our soul can we have joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah [Music] God bless you I love you I know sometimes you don't think I do but I do I pulled them down lower in the snakes about it now you lift them up Harry oh children I want I want when we come together us to be able to walk out these doors and you'll go out and smile and Shake one of those hands and fellowship and all that I want you to do that but I want you when you go
