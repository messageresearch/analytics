[Music] marvelous the grace that called my falling so he love beyond all my fs and S my [Music] need thank God for Grace to us tonight God bless you so happy we could be together once again again in in the presence of the Lord Brother Joe had asked me the other day if I liked the singing and the preliminaries about the well before we do the question answers and I told him absolutely I think it helps create an atmosphere for us to be able to enter into the presence of God don't you all I appreciate our brothers the effort that they put forth into the the music and the singing and we're grateful for that I like hearing a preacher that you can tell he's prepared I like hearing singers that you can tell they're prepared hearing musicians to me it just reflects something about the way we feel about the Lord you know the Bible tells us that whenever Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain and he testified that he was considered righteous and it's amazing that God did not accept Abel because of the sacrifice but God accepted the sacrifice because of Abel and because God would not accept Cain he wouldn't accept him so it's the same with us whenever we come and we sacrifice I doubt some of you sacrificed to be here tonight maybe had to miss your supper and whatever boy you've had to do but we realize with Christianity if there isn't a sacrifice we don't appreciate it it's like it means nothing to us whatever I can go to church whenever I want to I can read my Bible when I want to but whenever it's a sacrifice it's like it has more value to it I trust it'll always be that way with us I didn't get done on the um um the question that we finished up on last time so I wanted to pick it up again I looked at it a couple different times and I thought well I covered quite a bit of it but the more I looked at it I thought no I think we need to go with it a little bit more and maybe bring a little bit more clarity to it so we'll uh we'll read this question how is it fair that a message Christian goes in the Rapture and any other denomination doesn't how is it fair now first of all I want to say the word fair is not a scriptural term the Bible doesn't say anything about fair this or fair that but it's a term that's an English term of course and it's a term the way that we measure whenever we look at things the way they're being dispensed or given out or treatment well they don't treat me Fair they treat me unfair this person gets more than I do or less than I do but when whenever we're talking about God God owns all Grace all Mercy all compassion faithfulness so on so on and so on so since it belongs to him then he can do whatever he wants to with it so first of all whenever we go to answering this let's look at it in in the right way that we will never be able to understand maybe all that God does when we talk about Fair how many of youall ate something before you uh came over here maybe over here or out in the Drive street so whenever you did that I want to ask you how many other people did you get food for other than yourself neighbors what about some homeless kids maybe some people standing on the side of the intersection coming off of the exit uh come out and there's some people there I will work for food I will do you mean you all had the osity to feed yourself and not feed somebody else is that fair yeah it is you me it fair that we get to have a place like this to worship God and several years ago I was in Kenya and preached under a big gigantic tree because they had no building and yet the presence of God came down there and God moved and God delivered as a matter of fact I received an email some months back from a young man that was just a little bitty boy whenever I was there he contacted malaria you know anything about malaria you know once you get it you never get rid of it the restk rest of your life an individual who's had malaria can't even donate blood because it's there but God healed that little boy that day underneath that tree and there's not one Speck of it left in his body so you think well is it fair that we would have a place like this and they would have to meet under a tree or maybe meet under a shack so whenever we go to looking at the way God dispenses stuff naturally it doesn't make sense but let's approach it tonight we'll pray and just ask God to open our hearts and help us to see it how many wants to see it right me too let's pray together father we love you so much we thank you for these young people that have assembled together tonight Lord not only for those but all of those that are streaming and those that will go back and archive the service I pray that you'll also open their understanding but truly we desire to know more about you and more about your ways and the things that you choose to reveal to us helps us to understand you better the way I look at it if I can understand you better and what you want of me then that means I can please you better in a more perfect way and you know my heart with all my heart that's what I want to do I believe these young people desire the very same thing so we look to you tonight to speak to us in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen God bless you you may be seated now in answering this question as a preacher does sometimes a preacher will answer a question with another question so I've got a few questions that I'd like to go for on this now whenever we go to looking at God's choice of who God chooses to give what again it is God's choice but keep in mind when you're thinking about uh the basis of this question how is it fair that a Messenger Christian goes in the Rapture any other denomination doesn't that's a pretty broad spectrum of a question to be able to answer in one night much less to try to divide it with two or three others but just let me say this so you understand just because a person says they are a message believer does not mean they're going in the Rapture you're not going in the in the Rapture because you sit in the message Church you're not going in a Rapture even because you say you believe God sent a prophet but we go in the Rapture because our soul is sealed by the Holy Ghost and we know that the way we receive the Holy Ghost is obedience to his word then God makes himself known to us so there will be no doubt countless of so-called message people that will not go in the Rapture because they said in a message church and they felt like I'm fine I'm good I I I believe God sent a prophet and I go to church every now and then and I do this and that and the other there'll be a bunch of them that'll be left behind so just because a person says that they believe the message and they're in the message does not believe they'll go on the rapture we use the term message to identify us because that's what the prophet used to himself of course and the the word term message is also used in the New Testament so it identifies a group of people that are believing a message that we believe was sent from God as far as any other denomination can people from the denomination come to the truth of course they can many of us had that background um a lot of you all as young kids probably have been raised in the message and that's all that you've ever known but some of your parents grandparents Aunts Uncles things like that come from a denomination but if they TR receive the spirit of truth and the spirit of light it will draw them out of the denomination because in Revelation 181 whenever John saw and he said there was a a great angel that came down out of heaven and he cried with a loud voice and he said come out of her my people and touch not her unclean things so that they would not be identified in the denomination why are we so against the denomination because it's manmade it's man man run it's man orchestrated would they ever let people baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus for the most part no they do not do they believe the fullness of the word they don't are are some of them good people as we would say well I guess if you're going to identify good people although the Lord Jesus said there is none good no not one so when we're talking about good remember the measuring Rod that that we're using are there some of them that love the Lord yes and they will come through the tri tribulation to be honest with you I don't understand how that a denominational person will be able to live and survive in the tribulation period because the prophet tells us they will be hunted down like dogs they will be persecuted they will be killed I honestly don't see how they will make it because there will not be one person here in the tribulation period with the Holy Ghost every person that had the Holy Ghost will be taken up those that are left here are those who think they are under the blood and then they will give their life no doubt there must be a special release of God to help them to be able to stand so it's not that we are against denominational people we're not against any people as far as people themselves but to be identified in the rapture we believe that the Rapture is for the elect of God now I think I asked the question last time we dealt with this how many of you young men feel like you have the choice to choose your wife how many of you sisters feel like you have the right to either accept a man or turn him down you want your daddy to pick him for you your mama what about your pastor what about your grandmother your grandfather no so it's fair for you to be able to choose your wife or your husband you agree with that tonight it's fair so is it fair for God to be able to choose his now keep this in mind that God has the ability that we don't have called for knowledge so God could look and see who would accept him and who wouldn't at the end of the Millennium after we have lived on this Earth for a thousand years and there will be people here the elect and glorified bodies there will be people here that are are not in glorified bodies they are in human bodies and they will see us and the Lord Jesus will be reigning from Jerusalem the temple will be built and all the great things of God that man as long for down Through the Ages will happen in the time of Millennium there'll be no deaths there'll be no suffering no heartache no crying none of the things like that that we know of and there will be people that will live on the earth that are not saved as we say but they are made to obey the laws of God made to do it then at the end of the Thousand Years the Bible says then Satan was loose out of his prison for a little season and he will go about all over the Earth gathering together all these people now they've seen Jesus Christ on a throne they've seen the elect of God in glorified bodies and at the end of that thousand years they will say I hate Jesus Christ I hate his kingdom I hate these people I hate him I didn't want to go to the Feast of Tabernacles they made me I did not want to go to church they made me uh it's it's more than I can comprehend that people would live on the earth first of all mortal human beings there's never been anybody that's lived to be a thousand years old because God said in the day you eat thereof that day you will die and that day was a Thousand-Year increment or a Thousand-Year dispensation the oldest man that we have record of in the Bible that lived was 969 years old and that was methusa Adam was 930 others 940 945 different ones but nobody ever lived to be a thousand years old but in the Millennium people will live to be thousand years old there is no devil so think about it it's not like there's demons they're all held captive in the regions of the lost so it's not like there's anybody there to even teach them how to sin they don't even know how they don't know how to sin they don't know how to lie they don't know how to commit adultery because it's not bread in them they're raised from the dead given the opportunity now remember they're not getting a second chance but it's people who never had the opportunity to hear the truth and God knows that I hope you understand it this way that God actually allowed some of them to be blinded so they would never be able to hear it or wouldn't allow preachers to go in a certain area because he needed somebody in the Millennium to Reign over and we're not going to Reign Over each other so in Psalms 2 God said I will give Thee the Heathen for thine inheritance speaking this is a Messianic Psalm speaking about the Lord Jesus so they they were not born in sin like we are now they were not raised up in in schools and and they started out and you know in the early years and somebody taught them how to smoke a cigarette they don't know none of that they've never taught how to lie never been taught and yet at the end of that Thousand Years Satan will go about all over the face of the Earth and there will be millions of them and they will make their choice and rebel against Jesus Christ and his kingdom now let me just make sure that you understand this if the Millennium would have been a million years five million 10 million at the end of that time frame some of them people would have done the same thing because it's like no matter how many opportunities God gives them they want nothing to do with him now you and I don't know who they are boy am I glad we don't have a clue who they are so we may look at people and think man they have messed up so many times there couldn't be any more grace there couldn't be they've run out well only God is the only one that could determine that we look at him and we think boy boy it's looking bad this time but God is the only one that can be able to know when people have crossed that line I hope that you and I never have to experience that for oursel or for any of our family members but God by for knowledge could look down through time and know every person of all the billions of people that have been on the face of the Earth over seven billion people on the face of the Earth tonight he knows every one of them by name he knews when they were born he knows know if they will or will not serve him he knows he could give them 500,000 opportunities to serve him and they would still say I want nothing to do with him others would say yeah I mean I don't mind being a Christian I don't want to go to hell and I I don't want to be lost but don't tell me how to dress don't tell me I can't do this and I can't go there don't tell me I can't drink now don't tell me that I can't listen to rock and roll music well you see by that very attitude and behavior it proves if they maintain that they cannot be the bride so which one of you Brothers then you're looking for a wife you find this young lady she's a beautiful young lady and you go to talking to her and say I really like her I think maybe you know there might be something there between us and then you go to talking real serious and you say now now if we were to get married you know now now what are you saying well she said let me tell you right now if you think that I'm going to take your name I don't like your name that your last name is weird so I'm keeping my own name and don't think now that you are ever going to tell me anything to do no as a matter of fact your brother Donnie marries us it will be a requirement he will not say that in my vows that I will obey you because I never will do you understand that sweetie well I'm going to tell you one thing young man if you marry a woman like that you're dumber than she is you know what you're asking for you know what you're asking for and she tells you look now you're you're going to be my husband and I want you to provide for me I want you to buy me clothes and I want you to feed me and I want you to take care of me but just so you know my love is not all yours I mean if I see somebody else that I think is more handsome than you are I I want you to know I will have no problem in kissing them I will have no problem in going out on a date with them is there any of you young man that would want to continue relationship with that woman well you see that's what the church is telling Jesus now Jesus I want you to know now I I love you so much and I thank you for dying for me on the cross but leave my clothes alone don't you tell me that I can not do this and do that the other N I want you to save me from hell I don't want to go to hell no I don't want to burn in no Lake of Fire I don't want to be unated but don't you go to tell me what kind of music that I can listen to a person like that is not a member of the bride of Christ because just like a woman keeps her virtues 15 years 20 25 whatever it is she lives a holy life a Godly life she keeps her virtues she walks walks upright before God she walks down that aisle I performed the ceremony they married they exchange vows and Rings she will give all of those virtues to one man she will lay aside her maiden name unless she incorporates it in with his uses it as a middle name of sorts but she will no longer be called by her father's name but by his name where before she had her own money had her own car she you know kind of do whatever she wanted sort of but now she finds herself saying honey I saw her pretty dressed is it okay with you if I get that can can we afford it now can well no no I I don't I don't think we can because our insurance is due you know for that woman to say oh my goodness this is my money oh no wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute it was yours before you and him got married just like his money was his before you got married but once you get married it's not just his and not just yours it's both of you together now some people have the philosophy whatever you know they tell the wife or their husband whatever is mine is mine and whatever is yours is mine that's the way they want it to be they want everything to be theirs but it's no longer just yours it's no longer just your life you young ladies you come and go as you please you know you go here you go there you do this that the other but whenever you become married you can't do that and that's not just so with young ladies that's so with men I know in the message a lot of the men don't want to be that way but a man that doesn't have that attitude about his wife girls don't marry him a man that will not make you a queen stay away from him I'm warning you as your pastor a man that will not admire you a man that will not make you the queen of his home the queen of his heart and treat you like a lady and love you so much that if a criminal broke in your house that he would beg that man to shoot him instead of shooting you that man is not worth your life husbands love your wives as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he may wash it by the water of regeneration or by the word that's the kind of man sisters that you want to marry you you sisters agree with that you agree with that well then you Brothers you agree with me then that the kind of woman you want to marry is one that says now honey we want to make a home together we want to make it together we're going to make decisions together and we're going to pray and we're going to seek God about brothers that kind of wife you want well surely we wouldn't want something that we wouldn't allow the Lord Jesus to have would we of course not so we can see the very epitome of God's character from the Old Testament and that God God exercises the right of sovereignty by being able to choose look with me in Exodus chapter 19:5 now therefore if you will obey my voice and deed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people now this is God speaking to the children of Israel if you notice what now there's a conditional part if you will obey my voice inde deed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is who a so here's the key sovereignty he's the one who brought them on the earth he's the one that gave every sinner this very day every breast that they breathed he gave them his Mercy for the hundreds of times their heart has beat and pumped gallons of blood through their body most of them will never thank him for it they'll never be grateful but yet all Humanity lays before him so he can reach down as you did when you were little and maybe your mom and daddy or Aunt or uncle or someone bought you some Play-Doh or you sat out in the mud and played in the mud whichever it was for you and you take that Play-Doh and you want to make a horse or you want to make a cow well who who's going to dictate you no no no you can't make a cow out of that who ever seen a Blue Cow who ever seen a yellow oh my goodness you've got to have a brown white polka doted you can't well if you wanted to make a blue cow out of blue Play-Doh that's what you done right so all of the earth lays before him and this this is what God said you will be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine Deuteronomy 7:6 for thou art Unholy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth now this is God's character the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people but because now this is why the Lord loved you it wasn't that they loved him he loved them you know why you're sitting here tonight oh brother Donnie I love the Lord I wanted to oh I made up my mind no actually what we did as the elect of God was we finally got our will in line with his that's all you done you finally surrendered your will and God coaxed on you and pulled on you until he finally got your will because you was here and he was here and he finally lined you up to where you surrendered to what he wanted you to be I'm so grateful that it's that way the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more number than any people for you were fewest of the people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the Oaths which he had sworn unto your fathers ha the Lord brought you with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt Deuteronomy 14:2 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord ha chosen thee To Be A peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the Earth Deuteronomy 26:18 the Lord hasth avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people as he hath promised thee and that thou should us keep all his commands Commandments and to make thee High Above All Nations which he has made in praise and in name and in honor and that thou mayest be a holy people unto the Lord thy God as he has spoken thee so it was not then that they chose the Lord it was not that Abraham said oh God oh God I'm making up my mind I'm going to serve you oh God I'm this that the other it was not Abraham that did that it was God that spoke these words to him and said as for me my Covenant is with thee as a matter of fact he never even asked Abraham if he wanted to he never even said now this is the way I feel but it's all based upon you now Abraham if you say no then I I I guess I just I guess I made a mistake mistake I'll give up God never even give him a choice I love that God never even said now really I I I want you to be saved can't you see the way people preach grace and mercy it's like that God had to send his little boy down from heaven and maybe somebody will feel sorry for him so the preachers get up and cry and beg and cry oh won't somebody come won't somebody come please please please feel sorry that ain't my my God Jesus came to seek and to save that which was lost he knows every creature that'll ever serve him and he knows there will be billions of them that if he gave them a million years of Peace a million years of happiness and joy at the end of that million years they Point their finger in his face and say God I want nothing to do with you I want your blessings I want your money I want your peace but don't you tell me how to live I'm not sure that we're grateful enough that we have a desire to serve him that we want to you realize how blessed you are you young ladies and young men you realize how blessed you are that you want to serve him you want to live for him nobody made you come tonight you didn't have to nobody made you come last night but you wanted to be here right you chose you chose this way praise the Lord but why did I choose it because he foreordained me to choose it just like he did you and others he could give them all kinds of things and at the end of it they'd still choose their selfish ways notice in Titus 2:14 who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works now this is one of the signs of his peculiar people even in the New Testament that they would be zealous and that word it's it's a word that comes from Zeal in the New Testament there was a group of Jews and they were called zealots so the zealots were known because of their passion they hated the Romans they hated the Roman government they done everything really so you'd be able to relate to it they were first century terrorists so they would slit a Roman guard's throat they would burn their corn they would burn their buildings down and they were little terror cells that's what they were and they were called zealots and the reason they were was because the Zeal they wanted their country back so bad they hated it that the Romans were there and many them lost their lives for it and this is the same word that Paul uses in describing the elect of God they have such a Zeal for the Lord it burns in them I mean that they can't live without him they can't even think without him correctly they can't function without him it's a Zeal it's a passion and the word zeal actually means a fire that burns within them so like a zealot oh he he he would kill he would murder he would do anything to be able to inflict some type of Terror on the first century Romans did it Avail to anything no of them they crucified them they hung them on crosses and they wound up just absolutely annihilating most of them zealots but there is no devils in hell can wipe out the real passion the real Zeal in our hearts for Jesus Christ so notice what the elect of God will be they will be zealous of good works it burns in them you know they're just well I heard brother Donnie say I've got to do this and brother Joe said I've got to I reckon I'm want to get my dos and my don'ts done and I want to go ahead and do it you're not doing it because you love him you're doing it because you think it's required of you a real Christian wants to know what's required not so they can figure it out and get as close to the world as they can and just walk really carefully they want to know what their boundaries are so they don't get in trouble but let me add to you another aspect of a real believer they want to know what's required because they also want to know what they can do above and beyond what's required because that's the way they feel about him they don't want to just do you know these required things and then you're good they don't live by that law they say is there anything else I could do is there anything else Lord that you'd like me to do is there anybody that you want to do this or that that nobody else wants to do that Lord I I I'd be willing to do anything because you've done so much for me I don't want to just do what I'm required to do I want to do above and beyond what I'm required now many of you have said unto me for years and years I could study I could study for an hour or so maybe to be able to get a sermon together I don't have to study hours and hours I don't have to study and read hundreds of quotes hundreds of scriptures I've done studies before in the message and quotes and have over 6,000 that I've looked at in one subject now did god require that Donnie if you do 5,998 I won't anoint you no I just want to make so sure I cover every inch of ground that I can and I also want to give you so much weapons to work with that you'll be able to leave out of here and kill every devil that gets in your path I want you to be equipped I want you to be ready if anybody can over equip you're looking at the preacher that'll do it because I want to give you everything that I can give you I don't want to just do what's required well tell me what's the minimum Lord so I can go out and do this and that and the other there is greater No Greater Joy in my life than to be able to study the word of God for God's people I don't believe it's just so for a preacher I think it should be for all of us now let me ask another question was it fair that the Lord Jesus Walks In A congregation around a pool called salom whenever they come in there now the angel of the Lord would come down on a certain season and they would lay the sick so there's crippled blind halt lame all kinds of people with all kinds of diseases notice St John 53 in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk blind halt wizard waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had know ain't that peculiar so here lays a multitude so it could have been hundreds could have been thousands a multitude is no certain number we don't know exactly how many it was but it was a vast I've been at that pool and it's quite a large place around this pool so there's porticos and porches and things like that so it was no doubt thousands of people whenever they was there and the angel of the Lord would come down and step in the water and Trouble the water and the first person that got in we think now wait a minute we've got thousands maybe 2,000 3,000 5,000 from looking at the place whenever I saw it there you could easily put several thousand people there so why would God only give healing to one person when there's thousands of them there you see when we take our mind and try to understand God we're already defeated before we ever star we now watch so the Lord Jesus goes in there now remember he is the Divine healer but Jesus did not go out and heal at just him Desiring to heal people now let me be honest with you if it was left up to me tonight when this service was over and I had the ability to do it I'll tell you what I'd do I'd go to the med center first because it's the largest one I would go in that Med Center and I'd offer one prayer and I would pray for every person in there and if it's left up to me I would pray that every one of them would clean out all them five floors of rooms everybody would check out tonight and they all go home well then I'd go to the next hospital then I'd go to Kingsport then I'd go to Bristol I'd empty out every one of them well I brother don't so people would know you've done it I wouldn't want to know I even prayed I just have a feeling for sick people but I tell you what a lot of that is human compassion us feeling sorry for people I see people whenever I'm out Lowe's Walmart you know it is and you go out you see sick people and this that and other I've actually stopped and prayed for people that were sick asked them if I could of course because you just feel for people and sometimes we get that confused with the way God looks at it so we ourselves we say oh be healed be healed be healed be healed be healed and here what was God himself and he walks among the people maybe stepping over a blind man stepping around a little girl that was crippled stepping around another one they just piled in there and it goes over to one man one man now we would look at that and think well that's not compassion you know why we would think that because we don't understand the Divine meaning of what compassion is the prophet describes this for us and he said compassion is not human sympathy but compassion is doing the will of God so we look at that and say oh my a a compassionate God would just heal everybody there well he didn't he didn't I walked into the hospitals many of times time and prayed for people I've seen God stop heart attacks in the med center I've prayed for people and God do all kinds of things absolutely do all kinds of things and yet other people there never got one thing you ought to be so grateful tonight that God's give you Grace you have found favor now watch and there was a certain man that was there which had an infirmity 30 and8 years so this guy had whatever it was he had the prophet said it was a prostate trouble had it 38 years it was not a terminal condition so it was not cancer it was not TB it was not something that he was right on his last leg and the man's going to die he'd had that for 38 years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him will thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir I have no man when the water's trouble to put me into the pool but when I'm coming another steth down before me Jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath I wonder how many babies toddlers teenagers old men old women blind daddy blind Mama maybe an old lady with her legs all contorted and twisted and crippled Jesus walked right by her you said but D why would he do that because the father had showed him a vision so he goes in and and he's looking there's all them people they wonder who is that guy he's looking they can tell he's intently looking for something what's he looking for he's looking for the man that he saw in the vision that the father showed him so he works his way around this group and that group and that group why Jesus had Divine compassion which is to do what heal everybody that was there that's human sympathy but compassion is doing the will of God so Jesus J goes and says these words to the man the man of course takes up his bed and walk it's on the Sabbath day the Pharisees of course you know they blow a gasket as we'd say I mean they get all bent out of shape Jesus just walks right out from among them and goes right on and leaves all the rest of those people laying there I wonder how many people died lost the night you got saved wonder how many of you satting here tonight that God had to deal with you five times 10 times 20 times 25 times before you ever really committed your whole life to him and maybe some people he called them once one time they live to be 75 80 years old 90 he gives them one call because that's all he's obligated to do but you see he looks in a way that we don't see and if he sees his own representation in that individual he cannot lose that person or he would lose a part of himself Hallelujah so again I'll ask another question was it fair that Jesus allowed Peter James and John to spend more time with him than the other nine disciples watch this Matthew 1771 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bring us him into a high mountain Mark 5:35 while he yet speak there came from the rulle of the synagogue's house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troubles thou the master any further as soon as Jesus Jesus heard the word that was spoken he sath unto the ruler of the synagogue Be not Afraid only believe when he suffered no man to follow him save Peter and James and John Mark 132 Jesus answering said unto him seest thou the great buildings there shall not be one one stone left upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he set upon the Mount of Olives over against the temple Peter and James and John and Andrew now we're talking about the original 12 disciples and yet Jesus allowed three of these guys more special occasions with him than any of the others now the other eight we know Judas was an elect but the other eight were just as chosen as these three are why brother Donnie do you do you know why you know why I don't but I figure if I needed to it would be in there so what do we do we trust him you know God does the same thing today that he will allow certain people to have certain experiences with him we may never have we may never have in our own life and we realize our experiences are predestinated by God and to me I've learned that I I I wouldn't want to experience something maybe in a higher sphere or in a place that I wouldn't be called to walk in that because it could be detrimental to me I would never want to soar into a realm I cannot imagine the realm that brother random must have walked in to be able to see angels and I was reading it today whenever the angel of the Lord come in when he saw him the first time when he was at the cave there praying and then into that little cabin of a thing and whenever he was there he was down on his face and he heard the footprints of a man coming but the man had not no shoes he was barefooted and he said whenever he opened his eyes he saw that man's feet and then he looked up higher and it was an angel standing there now I've seen Angels myself but I've never seen them to where it did not terrify me I've seen demons same thing AB absolutely terrify you to be honest with you I'm glad I don't see them every day I don't think I'm made to you understand maybe some of you have never seen him and maybe you never will well God knows exactly what each of us can take now brother R said whenever he would finish the prayer lines at night and he would go back to the hotel room those demons would come in his room he would feel their flesh rub him in the night he would hear chains rattle they would come in his room and torment him you understand what had happened people in those meetings had been delivered and them demons was bringing them chains that they had been set free from and rattling them around that Prophet trying to scare him and make him afraid I'm not made to hear that if I ever heard that I'd be buried underneath the covers or I'd done be out of the hotel room I'd be you know going somewhere else anybody else here with me okay all right at least y'all on the same page see we're not called we're not we're not called to be able to experience things like that I I've seen things like that a few times and I've wrestled with demons and and that sort of thing but I'm not called to do that on the daily day to-day thing I'm not called to do it so God calls us and God gives us according to what he knows we're called to do now the same with Peter and James and John notice in Mark again whenever Jesus Mark 14:32 and they came to a place which was called Gethsemane and he says to his disciples sit here while I shall pray and he taketh with him Peter and James and John and begin to be sore amazed and to be very heavy so they enter in with him in Glory they enter in with him can you imagine on Mount Transfiguration he takes them up to the mountain there Peter James and John and they look out there and they see Moses and Elijah standing there in glorified bodies and they watch the Lord Jesus as he is transformed the word metamorpho he actually was transformed and they saw him change as they come off the mountain and they had to tell the rest of the brothers you imagine how the rest of the brothers saw well how come I didn't get to see that you know how we are as human beings if we feel like anybody's getting something more than we do come on let's be honest we have a little problem with that don't we and they were it's evident they were unconverted because it's arguing about which woman was going to be the the greatest so why did he do that but as we look on in the book of Acts and we can see Peter James and John were the prominent of the three so the Lord Jesus was doing this for a cause and a reason another question I had a conversation with my parents asking why message people get the privilege to go into the raptures from the same individual but my Baptist friend wouldn't Matthew chap 27:1 15 now let's look at this Resurrection Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the temple was ran and Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were open I'm sure you know this already but there has already been a resurrection of the Dead not a child not one or two in the Old Testament and in the new but there has been a mass resurrection of the Dead That's when Paradise was emptied out now want you to notice though it was not everybody that was dead and the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept aose now you notice that Matthew when he coined this term he did not say all the bodies for whatever reason Adam and Eve did not raise actually brother Brandon places them in our Resurrection he said Adam will reach over and take a hold of Eve she will reach over and take a hold of Seth Seth will reach over and take a hold of Enoch and on down and on down and on down there's a reason for it oh do you know the answer brother Donnie no another one I don't know the answer of but all I know is I'm just glad I'm going to be part of it aren't you so you see when God puts people in and leaves people out many times we don't see the bigger picture God will heal some and God will choose to take others and we look at and say that makes no sense that makes no no sense why would God why would God heal that one and that one and that one and and and and not heal this one and take it well we have to trust him that his plan is a great plan perfect Flawless makes no mistakes whatsoever and he's working it for the good of that individual you believe that now watch what happened and the graves were open many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection so actually these Graves were open after Jesus come out now we know the prophet tells us that Abraham and Sarah were part of them there was a dimension that was held downward that down down this way you know there's three dimensions this way three above us and then here we live in the fourth dimension 1 through four and and this mortality but they could not go up into the presence of God so there was a place called paradise and this is what Jesus told the thief on the cross this day you will be with me in Paradise because the blood had not been shed so the souls could not go to the sixth Dimension he created the sixth Dimension when he made all seven but he knew that mortal Saints could not be able to come straight from this world and go straight into that realm so they went downward and they were held down there waiting for the shedding of the blood when the Lord Jesus goes down and he becomes the atonement for our sins then Paradise was emptied out he goes to hell knocks on the gate the door to hell and whenever he does he conquers the devil he reaches in there and grabs a hold of the king keys and slams the door shut the prophet said and kicks everything on the wall off man that was a Victor wasn't it and then he goes over in a realm that is very close now remember Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Ezekiel Jeremiah Zachariah Hagi all of those saints of God were there in that Dimension and they were waiting for the promised Redeemer so Jesus goes in there and knocks on the door and then they come and he said come on children let's go and he sets them free and empties out out paradise then Jesus raises from the dead and then the prophet said that was Abraham and Sarah and Jacob and Joseph and they were being seen by people on the Earth and Abraham looked over at Sarah and said Sarah we better leave we're being recognized praise be to God I believe our resurrection's fixing to happen too before long same thing's going to take place again so they no longer go to par Paradise but they go up into the sixth Dimension watch again Revelation 20:4 I saw Thrones and they that set upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received the mark of their foreheads or in their hands now this is tribulation Saints of course and they lived and reigned with Christ A Thousand Years but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection you mean he can choose even which ones comes out the rest of the Dead live not till the thousand years were finished yes he can blessed and holy is he that ha part in the first resurrection for on such the second death has no power so is it fair for God to choose his own bride is it fair for God to raise in the first resurrection Those whom he fornew and chose them before the foundation of the world and you all said Romans chapter 9 verse 7 neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the sea for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son not only this but when Rebecca also conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children now listen carefully the children being not yet born neither having either done good or evil but that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that cth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger now here we're talking about a chosen man married to a chosen woman and they're going to have two sons twins but just because the father is chosen and the mother is chosen does it mean that every progeny of their Union will be chosen Now by natural Birthright the first firstborn would get a double portion of the inheritance but God said in this situation it will not be the Elder that will be my choice my choice will be the younger you say how could he do that he could look at Esau before Esau was ever born he could look at Jacob before Jacob was ever born he could see that Esau would trade his Birthright for a bowl of beans as we would say lentils so can you imagine he come in one day and Jacob had these lentils and Esau had been out hunting and he was hungry and he was thirsty and tired and Jacob said oh I I'll I'll I'll let you have this oh he so s I'm so hungry I'm so hungry let let me have it let me have it he said all right I'll do it let me have your birth right he the birth what difference does that make you see that was his attitude so what does the birthright type for us the baptism of the Holy Ghost so people like baptism of the Holy Ghost I belong to the church I put my name on the church that's why God will not let people who cling to a denomination or membership go in his Rapture because they care nothing about the birthright it's my mama was a Methodist my daddy was a Baptist it was good enough for them it's good enough for me oh but the Bible says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost my church don't believe in the Holy Ghost you see what they're doing they're doing exactly the same thing that Esau did I don't need no Holy Ghost I'll never get up at no Alder you'll never see me shouting and jumping around like a a bunch of Holy Rollers why them people that go to that word of lie my goodness I heard some of them last night screaming and hollering even some of them young people was praising God oh that would embarrass me so much and yet some of them same people will go to a ball game and scream and holler and jump up and down wow so they'll do that for their team and won't even hardly do this for Jesus can't you see why he would not take a person like that to be his wife I wouldn't marry a woman like that can you imagine a woman wanting to be your wife and say don't you touch me don't you get close to me don't embarrass me don't you do that Jesus don't don't do that don't you anoint me in front of my friends and make me cry that's embarrassing Jesus the only reason It embarrasses you because you don't love him right if you loved him right you'd say whatever you want to do go ahead you want me to roll I'll roll you want me to scream I'll scream you want me to holl I don't care whatever you want me to do I'll do it I was lost and you found me I was blind and you opened my eyes I'll do whatever you want me to do but you see those who cherish their membership or what will the mayor think I don't care what the mayor thinks I don't need the mayor's approval to be able to preach like I did last night I don't need the governor's approval I don't need to call Mr Biden and ask him he probably wouldn't know anyway I'm not sure he even knows what world he's in from one day to the next to you I don't need his approval and to be honest with you I don't need yours I don't need need the approval of the deacons of the church the trustees of our church cuz the deacons of our church don't run this church praise the Lord the trustees of the church don't run this church we want the Holy Ghost to run our church so I want to please him don't you all I want to please him whatever he wants me to do if he wants us to scream one night and holler that night and then the next service we cry and oh we repent praise God if that's what he wants we want him to have his way will you see what that shows that shows that we want his headship so I wonder how many denominational Christians would say to Jesus Jesus if you want me to dance tonight I'll dance if you want me to go home and clean out my closet I'll get rid of all my slacks I'll never cut my hair again Lord I'll never drink another beer I'll Never Smoke another cigarette whatever you want me to do of course they won't but the bride will because she's married to him and now this is what God saw about Esau it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated now I know this sounds very very hard but there's one thing you want to keep in mind about the word hated the Hebrew of course is written the Old Testament was written in Hebrew and when you look at the word hated the Bible says that God saw that Leah was hated and that Rachel was loved now it seems as if though how in the world could Jacob do that but when you look at the Hebrew word it don't mean what we think hate but it simply means she was loved less now remember the scripture never contradicts itself John 3:16 tells us God so loved the world right that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life but God does love the world but not in the same degree that he loves the bride praise the Lord now those of you that are married tonight no doubt you wives there's other brothers here in the church that you love I hope you don't love them the way you do your husband and the same for you brothers or maybe sisters in the church that you love them as sisters but you certainly don't feel the same way I love every one of you sisters tonight but there's one particular sister in here that whenever I'm done here in a little bit she goes home with me she has my name she has my checkbook she has a a key to every vehicle that I own she can drive whichever one she wants whenever she wants why she is my wife I love all the rest of you but don't come up to me and ask me for a spare key to my car don't ask me for a key to my truck because I ain't going to give it to you okay but I love you now honey I just don't love you the same way that I love her well you see that's the way God looks at the church and he looks at them and he says I do love you all I don't want you to Lo be lost it's not my will that any of you would perish but I see you all will never love me right you will never ever totally submit to me so I'll save you I'll even heal some of you I I'll move for you but pardon me while I really love on my wife cuz I love her so much I don't want her going through the tribulation I don't want her down here when all hell is breaking loose I love her so much as he got a right to do that oh yeah he does because he looks and sees what the church will be and he looks and sees what the bride will be and he says my bride I have loved and the church I love less because they love me less you see Jesus is a perfect gentleman we may look at it Sunday if you and I have invited to someone's house and they come to the door and let us in we knocked on the door rang the doorbell whatever it was and come on in come on in and then they said now listen you sit right there we're going to go in the kitchen and we're going to eat don't you get out of that chair you're not invited to supper you just sit right there and you be quiet don't be on your phone so they leave you 45 minutes hour they come back and they start just talking to one another start reading a book getting on their phone and you're sitting right there they don't talk to you they don't say how's your day been how you been doing how how's your family they just leave you sitting there and they intentionally ignore you after an hour or so one of them finally comes to you and said you can leave now we're fixing to get ready to go to bed and we really don't want to be troubled by you and you get up and say okay I I'll see yall yeah we want you to come back tomorrow night because we want to do you the same way that we did you tonight how many of us would go back to their house tomorrow night but you know what Jesus does many of the churches in our Tri Cities that's the way they treat him they'll stand up now we will have brothers so and so to invite the presence of God to come our gracious Heavenly Father we ask you to come in this place tonight but if anybody started getting a little bit emotional and even started reacting hey hey hey don't you start doing that Jesus we don't believe that stuff here and yet you know what he'll do he'll come service after service and they just leave him there they'll talk about him they'll use his name if that was me I'd go once I might even go twice probably after that I would never go back that's one of the many differences between me and God just one of the many but he goes back to our house he comes to our church and whenever we have time we talk to him and around all of our rest of our activities and he's so hungry for our love he's so hungry for our attention it's just like he would sit there and look at us like a little you know just like a little child or something that would sit there and just look and and look and see if you'd pay him any attention me traveling all over the world and you know being known all over the world and I don't say that to brag I just say it because it's a truth whenever I go out and all over the world and oh my goodness the people just for me to stop and shake their hand African Indian places like that photo photo photo they want a photo so everybody wants their picture with you you think you gave them $10,000 they want this ugly mug shot with me you know and just say oh my goodness oh my goodness those that come here and visit when they come back in my office all of them want a picture they want to send it to Africa last time somebody was back there month or so ago they took a picture picture of me I started getting it from Africa it went from here to Africa to India to Here There and there why because they like being identified with Servants of God it means something to them to stand beside a a man of God they have respect for and they want to be identified and I say Jesus we want selfies with you for sure at the day of judgment oh yeah oh yeah I want my picture with him oh man alive if my picture is with Jesus I I won't be L but I don't want him just on the day of judgment I want him a part of my life every day don't you no doubt there's been days I made him sit in a chair cuz I was just too busy if I was him I probably wouldn't have nothing to do with me I'm so glad I'm not him aren't you if you was him would you have anything to do with you the way we've treated him oh but I'm so glad that he come to the Earth to live in this old body he knows how these are and when you look at Jacob the prophet said that Esau morally was a better man than Jacob he was a liar a trickster a deceiver but God said I love him I love him and I choose him because he will wanted that birth right and that's the way we are there's something inside of us I believe sometimes Christians are some of the stupidest people that ever lived I tell Carol all the time sheep are the dumbest bunch of people that ever lived sheep as Christians we do some of the dumbest things come on don't sit down and look at me I'm talking about some of you I'm talking about me and yet God reaches to us and our stupidity in our ignorance how many of us have fell into the some the same traps over and over again come on let's be honest I mean just dumb stuff that we do with like ain't no way he'll forgive me but he does he does thank God for his Mercy thank God for his Mercy what does he want you continue doing that well of course not but he knows if he can get you to that place of victory that you will be like Jacob was it finally he'll be able to change your name till you'll no longer be Jacob but you'll be Israel that's what God saw about Jacob it wasn't just the ups and the downs and the ends in the outs and God oh my how can I tolerate that but God has the ability to look down here however far it is in the journey and God says if I can get him or her to that spot it will change them forever and God allowed this man to go over the brook one night when he's going to meet his brother the next morning and an angel of God which was God himself and a human appearance and Jacob Hears A noise in the bush and they said who are you no doubt scared and he saw him something moving in the shadows but it grabbed a hold of him and they wrestled and they wrestled and the angel said let me go he said what's your name why did you asked me my name saying it's a secret and he said what's your name he said my name is deceiver Jacob Hallelujah and the angel said let me go can you imagine a man having such a hold on an angel that the angel asked for deliverance it was a condensation of God that placed himself in a human form that a human could could grab a hold of God don't you understand he's done each of you the same way he come down to you in such a way that you could grab a hold of him in such a way and you've got such a hold on him tonight that he will never let you go Hallelujah he said let me go for the day breaks he said I will not let you go till you bless me you know the story well that's the old that was the time God was waiting for he put up with all this nonsense all these failures all these mistakes waiting for that change right there that's why he has Mercy on us because he knows tonight tomorrow Sunday maybe Monday you're going to get it yes he sees it he knows it he's not guessing is not open he knows every elect member will get it and it will be impossible for them to be lost what should we say in it is your unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then is not him that will us nor him that run us but of God that show us Mercy for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he Harden us how could the bible say that God hardened Pharaoh's heart God knew if he give Pharaoh a thousand chances 10,000 chances a million chances Pharaoh would still turn him down God knew that so God could Harden his heart because he knew it's amazing when you read these instan in the scripture that the Bible would say God hardened his heart and then it would say Pharaoh hardened his heart don't you see what was happening God was only doing the exact same thing to Pharaoh that Pharaoh was doing you understand why God turns people over to reprobate mind that's the path they choose that's the path they want this is why it's so important that we make the right choice we choose him we want right then what does God do God gives us what we want oh Hallelujah God gives us what we want Jacob wanted a chains God gave him a chains Pharaoh wanted a hardness of his heart God said fine that's what you want that's what I'll give you you want church membership that's exactly what God will give you but if you want the birthright and you say I don't want to just belong to Word of Life I don't want to just be part of the use of word of life I I want that Birthright I want to know beyond the shadow of a doubt I've got the Holy Ghost the token is in my soul when the Rapture takes place I will not be left and if brother Donnie stands up there and says well glory to God there's only going to be one person for Word of Life leaving you can jump to your feet and say I hate to tell you brother Donnie but it's going to be me God wants you to know in such a real way that if there ain't but one leaving in this church it's going to be you praise God so that will say then unto me why does he yet find fault for who ha resisted his will now Paul knew this sovereignty of God would be questioned down Through the Ages nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why have you made me thus has not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor what if God willing to show his rest and to make his power known ured with much long suffering the vessels of rest fitted to destruction do you understand that's what God is doing to all these Sinners out here these reprobates that he knows will never serve him they will never live for him he is enduring them he is putting up with them he already knows their end he knows what they'll do but he will let them live out their choice oh my but I love this next part and we're going to close and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy the the vessels of Mercy notice the two different types of vessels in verse 22 and verse 23 one is identified as a vessel of Wrath and the others are identified as vessels of Mercy on which he a four prepared unto Glory I trust every one of us here tonight are one of those vessels of Mercy and let me just say this to you but brother Donnie what if I'm not elect brother Donnie do you know beyond the shadow of a doubt that you are elect y'all ready for my answer no I do not know beyond a shadow of a doubt oh brother Donnie we we just knew you were bride I believe I am I believe the token I have the token and if I do I am his elect do I see myself in the word yes but does the devil still come to me and say oh you know you ain't one why you know you ain't never been good enough you can never do this you can never be like this brother that brother the other brother you mean the devil bothers you with that stuff oh yeah whether or not you believe it the devil still comes to me and tells me now you know there really ain't no God cuz you can't really prove him by SS you know that he can't be proved and I'll come right back well I know I can't prove him by science but I was there when it happened and I know it happened to me and that sure didn't happen out of evolution I didn't become like this I come from a polywog to a frog and then from something else to something else and all of a sudden I become a man so can I prove God by science no can I prove that I'm bride because I shout jump run preach whatever more I can't but I believe with all of my soul I am but let me tell you the way I approach it even if I'm not he will not cast me into hell cuz I don't want to go there I love him and the prophet told us if you want to be saved God is obligated to make a way for you but let me just tell you how I feel from my heart now close I don't think there's any way on this Earth I could love him the way I do and not be bright because I love him more than I love life Hallelujah you can look at yourself and ask what do you love most of all and judge yourself by this if the Lord Jesus come to each of you tonight after this service and said I'm going to give you 30 days you can do anything you want for the next 30 days lie cheat steal commit adultery rob banks you know do whatever do whatever you want at the end end of those 30 days I will forgive you it'll never be remembered I'll never mention it to you again I think about that what would you do and the way you would answer me tonight from your soul I'll have a pretty good idea if you've got the holy ghost or not if God were to come to me tonight and tell me that first of all it would scare me to death cuz I think Lord do you see something in me do you would see something in me that I that I would want wrong but I'll tell you what I do I'd pray I'd read my Bible more every day than I do now I'd listen to more tapes than I'd do now because i' think oh my goodness oh my goodness 30 days oh oh 30 days I'm on this trial I I don't want him to think I want anything other than him you understand what I'm to say it do you understand a mortal cannot feel that way unless they've been changed unless they've been changed a person a saved person can be saved and love the Lord and if that offer was offered to a saved person many of them would take it even offered to sanctified people they would take it because that snake is still in their heart the only people with the power to turn that down would be those who've had the snake taken out remember when brother R preached the future home and he draw two human hearts and he draw a dove inside of one and a snake inside of the other now he said this one has the Holy Ghost and this one doesn't only those with the Holy Ghost of their hearts would have have the ability to say no father I don't want sin I don't want unrighteousness I want you amen let's bow it together Lord Jesus I want to thank you for these special times that we can have together like this I I can't say that I understand what the difference is in regular service that we have but somehow it just feels so special your presence has been with us through every one of these question answer services and we want you to know we're so grateful we're so thankful we love feeling your presence sensing that you're near us Lord I pray that you'd help us to think and contemplate these things that have been said tonight father maybe it'll answer the question on somebody else's heart as well maybe they thought about it and pondered about it Lord we don't want to be any of those people that would choose the world we don't want to be any of those Christians are they Christians Christians yes we would say they were that would set you in the corner of their life and they go on and live the way they want to and act the way they want to and they leave you sitting there humiliated and embarrassed Jesus forgive me forgive me Lord God forgive me for any day of my life that I've ever done you that way forgive me Lord I want you to be a part of everything that I am Hallelujah Jesus May every young person may every other person that'll hear this service I believe Lord by you leading me that way tonight I could see it as it struck their hearts I saw it Lord on the countenance of many of their faces it was like for the first time they saw it and they saw that you want to be a part of our everyday life whether we're studying for a test or we're doing our job or whatever it is that we're doing you don't want to be left in a chair by yourself you want to be part of our friends as a matter of fact you want to choose our friends for us it'll save us a lot of trouble if we'll let you choose our friends Lord Jesus help us to invite you into every aspect of Our Lives May we not have a room may we not have a closet may we not have a pantry a kitchen a dining room a living room a bedroom an attic anywhere in our lives that you're not 100% welcome father we love you Jesus Come into our hearts Lord in such a way may we open

welcome well we won't be there either we want you in our daily activities we want you in our home the prophet said the reason more Angels don't visit us in our homes is because our homes aren't consecrated the way they should be but Lord we want homes to Where Angels of God can come where we are oh Hallelujah we love you Jesus Lord no longer than we've been here in this new place the angel of the Lord has already been seen here that's the kind of church we want one night Lord before we left the old church and at the end of the service and the anointing was moving so wonderful and I looked over toward the direction where Harry was sitting on the organ and I saw an angel standing there there in white [Music] garments dark brown hair standing there with his arms crossed oh Jesus that's the kind of church we want that's the kind of homes we want Lord one of the little sisters of our church in another setting scene the angel of God standing near me as the preaching of the word was coming forth that's the kind of church we want that's the kind of homes we want so when demons come in and try to invade us the angels of God can come to our rescue hallelujah hallelujah as

[Music] I I'm desperate for [Applause] you Jesus and [Music] [Applause] I I'm lost without you amen would you enjoy that tonight I never I never have ever questioned election um election to me you know brother brandom made that plain when he when he said you were in God's thoughts before the foundation of the world God you are expressed thought of God but I always always wondered and I could never grasp the scripture where Jesus tells them is that their eyes were blinded unless they believe and be saved as brother is the the question was asked tonight how is it fair and the Bible says that God is a just God means god is a fair God he's not unjust he's not unfair so we look at that and for years that bothered me he's a just God but yet he's blinding eyes L and then you realize it's by forn knowledge he knew that those that He blinded the eyes lest they believe and be saved they will be given that opportunity after the first resurrection after the Thousand Years but you look at at what he gave you that person is only going to get one offered one time but to you and me offered he's offering the Holy Ghost to you time and time again brother brandom said it's a free gift it is a free gift and he keeps holding it out offering it to you I had a young man tell me sometime last year we was talking about the scriptures and I and I to told him we was talking about the B how Matthew it says in Matthew that the holy spirit will lead you into all truth and he said oh that was just for the disciples I said well how do we get Revelation it's black and white it's written there on the paper it's black and white that's how he got Revelation was through reading it off a page without the Holy Ghost and I got to thinking if if if the Holy Ghost was the disciples what was that that was getting through me through that trial time and time again what gets you through the things in in your life it's not human willpower God allows you to go through some things that human willpower will never ever get you through it takes the Holy Ghost and he's a just God he's a fair God I so enjoy that whoever wrote that question thank than you he's he's Fair the Bible says he's not unfair and it really doesn't explain why he's not unfair but it says he's Fair that's good enough for me so I hope y'all enjoyed that tonight if you will let's give brother Donnie a hand that was wonderful so be praying for service Sunday U be praying for our young people that's going to Louisiana um we got in in about four weeks we've got our youth services coming up so be mindful of those as
