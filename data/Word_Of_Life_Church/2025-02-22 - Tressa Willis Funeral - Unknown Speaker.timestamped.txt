[22:56] circumstances that we were here today
[22:58] but I'm still happy to see everyone and
[22:59] I know that my mama would have been
[23:01] happy to see you all here
[23:06] today tresa was
[23:10] uh born 58 years ago passing away on
[23:16] Monday she was
[23:18] a loving wife loving mother and a a
[23:22] grandmother that just was top of the
[23:25] line you can ask any of her kids and you
[23:28] can ask her daughter-in-laws and you can
[23:31] ask me your son-in-law and I'll tell you
[23:33] the honest truth she was a remarkable
[23:35] person and we love her still love
[23:39] her in preparing this speech it's never
[23:43] easy when reflecting on the life uh as
[23:46] we have
[23:47] to but speaking of my mother-in-law
[23:49] there is not enough time to get into the
[23:51] friendship that I had with her for
[23:53] nearly 30
[23:54] years before I married Britney 15 years
[23:58] ago go I was best friends with her son
[24:01] Zach and
[24:02] Matt and she was always a mother figure
[24:06] to me even before I became part of the
[24:11] family she was always a family first
[24:14] woman she's married to my father-in-law
[24:17] for over 40 years raising three children
[24:21] together one of which uh turned out
[24:26] okay the other two
[24:29] she
[24:30] tried it's all that can be
[24:32] said but she wanted the best for all of
[24:36] them and she did her best to give it to
[24:42] them in our own
[24:44] relationship it was a few years before I
[24:47] knew this I I she told me this about the
[24:49] time me and Britney got married they had
[24:52] just moved to this area and were talking
[24:56] and she so happened to look down and saw
[24:59] a little boy walking down one of the
[25:01] aisles in a little mismatched suit and
[25:03] she said that's going to be my
[25:04] son-in-law right
[25:07] there 12 years later she was proven
[25:16] right she was always there for her kids
[25:18] and the only thing she loved more than
[25:20] them was her
[25:23] grandchildren and I believe that she
[25:25] truly with all her heart loved all of of
[25:29] them and she gave each of
[25:32] them the equal amount of love she never
[25:35] picked any kind of
[25:36] favorites every Christmas every birthday
[25:39] every moment was made
[25:44] special she was always just a phone call
[25:47] away with motherly
[25:51] advice getting into a different side of
[25:53] her
[25:54] though one of my little
[25:58] Parts was my mother-in-law was
[26:00] incredibly easy to
[26:04] startle and I think my brother-in-laws
[26:07] and I put several of the gray hairs on
[26:09] her head due to our more Carefree
[26:12] attitude and general
[26:16] stupidity mama and I would often get
[26:18] into kind of a contest on social media
[26:21] of who could scare the other more with
[26:23] uh jump scares and different
[26:25] videos she never won
[26:30] but I can still remember the all cap
[26:31] text that I would get back and I can
[26:34] still hear her scream oh gee when
[26:37] everything went everything started to
[26:39] scare she would immediately just lock
[26:47] up she made all of us feel special on
[26:49] our birthdays and
[26:56] Christmas every
[26:59] one of my birthdays I had
[27:03] a a box of no bakes and homemade fudge
[27:06] that was better than anything that
[27:08] Gatlinburg could have ever
[27:10] made and I still have my collection of
[27:14] pajama pants that she got us every
[27:17] Christmas all three of
[27:21] us we'll miss those little things
[27:26] now Jesus
[27:31] forgive
[27:32] me when Mama first got the
[27:35] news we all immediately started
[27:39] praying for healing us and all of you
[27:45] and people who never even had the
[27:47] pleasure of meeting her and I want to
[27:49] take this moment to say thank you to
[27:51] each and every one of you who took time
[27:53] to pray and all the prayer
[27:55] cloths the food
[27:58] everything has just been so overwhelming
[28:01] to my family during this time we
[28:05] appreciate the home visits that we that
[28:07] she got and the support during
[28:16] this this was a lot easier when I was

[29:05] playing and the last thing that I
[29:07] actually got to hear
[29:09] her say
[29:11] fully was she raised those little hands
[29:14] and said victory is
[29:22] mine mama raised her feeble hands and
[29:24] said that in front of all of us
[29:29] to all of you who prayed for her
[29:33] healing and to all of us who had hoped
[29:35] the situation would turn out different
[29:38] in healing I'd like to remind you all of

[44:48] image and the image of God created he
[44:52] them male and female created he them in
[44:57] Genesis
[44:58] 2:7 and the Lord God formed Man Out of
[45:02] the Dust of the
[45:04] ground so wonder what kind of man that
[45:07] was in Genesis
[45:09] 1 that man was made in the image of
[45:12] God and then God puts that man into a
[45:16] dust body and the Lord God formed man of
[45:19] the Dust of the ground and breathes into
[45:21] his
[45:22] nostrils the breath of life and Man
[45:25] became a living
[45:28] Soul so there are most two different
[45:31] types of men that were in the Garden of
[45:34] Eden we look at ourselves today as human
[45:38] beings and we can see that there is a
[45:41] Supernatural part about us a part that
[45:45] does not die when you came around by
[45:48] today and shook the hands of the family
[45:51] and expressed your heartfelt condolences
[45:54] to them and walked by this cast
[45:58] actually what you saw was an empty house
[46:02] a house that was
[46:03] inhabited just a few days ago by another
[46:08] being a being that is not dead according
[46:12] to Genesis 3: 19 after the fall when God
[46:18] had spoke to man and said in the sweat
[46:20] of thy face shalt thou eat bread and
[46:23] till thou returned to the ground for for
[46:27] out of it was thou taken for dust Thou
[46:31] Art and to dust thou shal
[46:35] return but what part goes back to dust
[46:39] the part that came from dust but where
[46:43] is the other part the man that God
[46:46] created in His image that had that
[46:49] Supernatural part so when our sister
[46:52] tresa was able to make peace with God so
[46:56] many many years ago and be able to pass
[47:00] from Death unto life the Old Testament
[47:03] view of death was very very vague very
[47:07] unclear even to the prophets the sages
[47:11] the righteous men that love God job said
[47:15] it this way in job chap 10 ver 20 are
[47:18] not my days few cease then and let me
[47:23] alone that I may take comfort a little
[47:27] before I go when I shall not return even
[47:32] to a land of
[47:35] darkness the shadow of death job is a
[47:38] great man in his day but death was still
[47:41] so obscure they didn't know where you
[47:44] went they didn't understand and he said
[47:48] a land of Darkness as Darkness itself
[47:52] and of the shadow of death without any
[47:57] order where the light is as Darkness
[48:01] Psalm 654 in death there is no
[48:04] remembrance of thee in the grave who
[48:08] shall give thee thanks Psalms 55:4 my
[48:12] heart is sore pain was meant Within Me
[48:15] and the Terrors of death are Fallen upon
[48:20] me so it was a world an experience that
[48:24] man didn't know anything about
[48:27] and is in indeed man's greatest fear
[48:32] there's something in us and I think of
[48:34] the great creator of God that whenever
[48:36] we see an urgent situation that within
[48:38] 3/4 of a second from the time that we
[48:41] see somebody stop in front of us our
[48:43] body is able to synchronize together
[48:46] with the brain through the tissues and
[48:48] the nerves and all that sort of thing
[48:50] and we can take our foot off the gas and
[48:52] put her foot on the brake um when God
[48:54] made man that didn't have cars and they
[48:57] didn't have people that drive the way
[48:58] people do today but I'm sure go go God
[49:01] made us with that in mind aren't you
[49:03] we'd been a mess today but you think of
[49:07] how that man was so hidden from the view
[49:11] of death when the Lord Jesus came to the
[49:14] Earth he totally changed the view of
[49:18] death look at this in Matthew chapter 9:
[49:20] 24 he said unto them give place for the
[49:24] maid is not dead
[49:27] but sleepest so this was a little girl
[49:30] that had died what we call death and the
[49:34] Lord Jesus said something that was so
[49:37] peculiar and so odd and he said hey hey
[49:40] everybody calm down the little girl
[49:43] ain't dead she's just sleeping and they
[49:47] laughed him to
[49:50] scorn so they made fun of the Lord Jesus
[49:55] and laughed at him and said are you you
[49:57] kid who do you think you are well he
[50:01] knew who he was and he knew the
[50:04] difference between death and eternal
[50:09] separation now he knew that this little
[50:11] girl even though they said she was dead
[50:15] in the way that he looked at it she was
[50:18] not dead at all now as we look at this
[50:22] empty house here this afternoon and we
[50:26] know we call it death and we've all had
[50:28] our acquaintance with death and our
[50:30] heart has been torn from us by facing
[50:34] one death after another after another
[50:36] from our families and our friends but we
[50:39] know our sister
[50:41] Tressa did not die and the reason of
[50:45] that is because she has already
[50:48] died she already face death and by
[50:52] facing that death and accepting the life
[50:55] of the Lord Jesus
[50:57] she can never die again you imagine as
[51:01] the Lord Jesus looked upon them and St
[51:04] John 11 some dear close friends of the
[51:08] Lord Jesus sent him a message and it was
[51:12] about one of his intimate friends this
[51:15] man's name was Lazarus his sisters Mary
[51:18] and Martha sent a messenger and they
[51:21] said Lazarus is very sick and would
[51:24] would you come now they had fors in
[51:26] their churches of that day they had
[51:29] already borne a great reproach for the
[51:31] Lord Jesus and You' think if you was a
[51:35] friend to the Lord Jesus that he would
[51:38] do something so special for you and you
[51:41] see this is where many people
[51:43] misunderstand even when a child of God
[51:46] is allowed to go through so much
[51:48] suffering and people will look and from
[51:51] their mind they're trying to comprehend
[51:53] why would a loving God ever allow his
[51:57] children to go through so much stuff and
[52:00] you're saying why don't he just heal all
[52:02] them and then let all the Sinners and
[52:04] all them Wicked people out there let
[52:07] them go through all the terrible things
[52:10] because God knows he can use his
[52:12] children to prove certain things about
[52:15] his word that he can never use a sinner
[52:19] to
[52:19] prove you know it's amazing that God
[52:22] sometimes will answer prayers within 24
[52:25] hours of the time we pray
[52:27] many of you probably like myself have
[52:28] seen him answered prayers in the matter
[52:31] of moments and watch what he did my wife
[52:34] called her mother yesterday in Kentucky
[52:37] very very sick and she called her in a
[52:40] few moments we had prayer for her
[52:41] sitting at the kitchen table and she
[52:44] talked to her again today and she said
[52:46] after you all prayed for me she said I
[52:48] turned off the phone and went to sleep
[52:50] immediately and she was testifying to
[52:52] the nurses and stuff where she was it
[52:54] was immediate it was much faster than I
[52:57] could drive 4 and 1/2 hours to be able
[52:59] to get to Kentucky but yet there's times
[53:02] God will answer immediately there's
[53:05] times God will say wait a while and then
[53:09] there's heartbreaking times when God
[53:11] will say
[53:13] no I'm not going to answer this prayer
[53:17] for
[53:17] you and all for for Christians and
[53:21] especially for those that don't
[53:22] understand they look at and say how
[53:24] could he do that because they measure
[53:27] God's love by their love so they look at
[53:30] their children and they think if my
[53:32] child was in a dilemma and my child was
[53:35] in a terrible situation there's no way I
[53:38] would let my child go through that I
[53:40] would reach down there and I'd do
[53:42] whatever I could but see you're
[53:44] measuring God's love by your
[53:47] love I've been a pastor of a church for
[53:50] many many years many decades I'm 68
[53:53] years old I've been preaching since I
[53:55] was 18
[53:56] and I've seen folks go through things
[53:58] that I have to tell you as far as a
[54:01] preacher I would have stopped it I would
[54:04] have held it off held it away from them
[54:07] and no doubt I would have made the
[54:09] biggest mess of their life because I'm
[54:12] looking at them with human sympathy and
[54:16] human compassion and I say I would stop
[54:19] them from that I'd never let them go
[54:21] through that I would never let them go
[54:23] through that part no way but God and his
[54:27] wisdom looks and sees that when we go
[54:29] through things he can bring us out on
[54:32] the other side and we will be able to
[54:35] testify of what Grace what mercy and
[54:39] what strengths that he brought us
[54:41] through you see there's been many people
[54:45] that has preceded our our sister tresa I
[54:49] read about them in the book of Hebrews
[54:51] chapter 11 called the faith chapter of
[54:53] the Bible and it begins to list many of
[54:56] them by name and it tells the various
[54:59] things that they went through and they
[55:01] trusted God and they believed God it
[55:03] gives several examples of God answering
[55:06] their prayers and how that God moved for
[55:08] them and wrought a great Deliverance but
[55:11] then it also tells about other
[55:14] people but God didn't answer them that
[55:17] way so there's certain people he will be
[55:20] able to prove his great power one of our
[55:23] sisters right here in the church several
[55:25] months ago passed away right back here
[55:27] in church when service was going on we
[55:30] have some nurses here at the church they
[55:32] went back there we began to pray for her
[55:35] and God spared her life the spirit of
[55:38] God moved for her we've seen so many
[55:40] miracles that God has done right here
[55:43] and at the same time we've had so many
[55:47] funerals so the same God that will raise
[55:50] the dead for some of his children he
[55:53] will let them go through the passage
[55:56] of the Valley of the shadow of death all
[56:00] of us are not called to fulfill the
[56:02] exact same scope in the economy of God
[56:06] there will be many many that love the
[56:09] Lord Jesus with all of their heart and
[56:11] they trusted him to deliver them of that
[56:14] sickness that disease whatever they were
[56:17] dealing with until the last breath left
[56:21] their
[56:22] body and people say well cancer got the
[56:26] best of them oh no no it didn't as a
[56:30] matter of fact I want to tell you T
[56:33] today that disease that riddled our
[56:36] sister's body and all that she went
[56:39] through it is not the Victor
[56:43] today because when life went from her
[56:46] body all them cells that was trying to
[56:49] multiply and take her life and so on
[56:51] what happened to all of them they are
[56:55] the one ones who died not our sister
[57:01] tresa as a matter of fact if we could
[57:03] move from this Earthly house here let us
[57:08] take a little
[57:10] brief brief
[57:14] travel we will go into where she
[57:18] was when she brother Randy told me that
[57:21] the night before probably the same
[57:24] situation the brother Philip was talking
[57:26] about that they was playing music and
[57:28] she had raised her hands up and her
[57:30] feeble hands that had been weakened by
[57:33] so much suffering and all that she went
[57:35] through but able to praise the Lord and
[57:39] love the Lord and worship him so what
[57:43] happened to that part so the part that
[57:46] motivated That animated her hands that
[57:51] animated her mouth to speak and to
[57:55] continuously hold on to the promise of
[57:58] God where is that
[58:00] person where is that image of that
[58:04] person that was doing that oh he say
[58:06] it's here no no it's not here something
[58:10] left this all this is is a house just
[58:13] like this building here it was empty
[58:16] several hours ago people begin to come
[58:19] in pay their respects in a little bit
[58:22] it'll be empty again where's the noise
[58:24] coming from in this building coming from
[58:27] singers preachers people well why don't
[58:30] the building itself make all them voices
[58:32] it has no ability to do so it's only
[58:35] concrete material that was put together
[58:38] to make a building that we call a church
[58:40] but this building has no animation and
[58:43] no life on its own and when life went
[58:47] out of this body what happens she can't
[58:50] even move a finger no longer bat an eye
[58:54] no longer make a smile
[58:56] or a frown but the real person that
[59:00] we're talking about today is part of
[59:03] that image that God made in Genesis 1
[59:07] you see our body is like an Earthly
[59:09] house and Paul talked about it in 1
[59:11] Corinthians
[59:12] 1547 the first man is of the Earth's
[59:17] earthy and it is simply made of Earth
[59:20] the second man is the Lord From Heaven
[59:23] as is the earthy such are they also that
[59:26] are Earthly as is the Heavenly such are
[59:30] they also that are Heavenly this
[59:34] Tabernacle that we live in is simply
[59:37] dust but where's the star part you see
[59:41] God gave Abraham two great shadows and
[59:44] types and every called him he said I
[59:46] want you to look up here to the stars
[59:49] and count them if you can and he said
[59:52] that's the way your seed will be
[59:56] then he brought him to the seashore and
[59:57] he Saidi want you to count the dust the
[1:00:00] grains of sand if you can that's the way
[1:00:04] your seed will be so from
[1:00:07] dust to stars from Genesis 1 to Genesis
[1:00:12] 2 and Paul says it this way for if this
[1:00:15] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[1:00:17] dissolved we have a build building of
[1:00:19] God an house not made with hands Eternal
[1:00:23] in the heavens so in this we do grown
[1:00:27] Desiring to be clothed upon with our
[1:00:30] house which is from heaven and if so
[1:00:33] being found clothed he said we will not
[1:00:36] be found naked at that day so when this
[1:00:40] Supernatural part that come out of this
[1:00:44] Tabernacle sister tresa the real one
[1:00:48] where did it
[1:00:50] go what happened to it is she a ghost
[1:00:55] today
[1:00:56] just a spirit that might appear and
[1:00:59] disappear and we may never see her again
[1:01:02] is that is that what she is no no
[1:01:05] actually she moved into a body that is
[1:01:09] called
[1:01:11] theophany and the word Theo of course
[1:01:14] those of you that know your Bible Theo
[1:01:16] comes from the same word that we use for
[1:01:19] deity
[1:01:21] Theos so it is a body that was made
[1:01:25] eternal in the heavens so when the life
[1:01:29] on out of this body it simply changed
[1:01:33] houses what sister tresa did on Monday
[1:01:36] was changed
[1:01:40] addresses God gave her many years ago an
[1:01:44] address change
[1:01:46] notification it was in the form of the
[1:01:50] Gospel she heard that and something
[1:01:53] touched her heart she'd been working on
[1:01:55] on that Journey ever since getting ready
[1:01:59] to move so instead of when she came down
[1:02:03] to death screaming hollering crying oh
[1:02:06] God I'm lost oh God I'm lost somebody
[1:02:08] help me somebody help me pull me out of
[1:02:10] the flames of fire no she didn't have to
[1:02:14] do that she could just simply take her
[1:02:17] last
[1:02:18] breath and all of a sudden she stepped
[1:02:21] out of this house now if you can imagine
[1:02:26] all that our poor sisters went through
[1:02:28] as my wife and I went to see them week
[1:02:30] before last and uh we were just both in
[1:02:33] shock how much she had changed since the
[1:02:36] last time we'd seen her brother
[1:02:38] Randy but just beyond this Veil is
[1:02:42] another
[1:02:44] body she'll never have another pain
[1:02:48] another heartache another
[1:02:51] sorrow you see the very same event that
[1:02:54] happened on Monday
[1:02:56] when the Bible tells us in the Book of
[1:02:58] Psalms precious in the sight of the Lord
[1:03:01] is the death of his
[1:03:04] Saints
[1:03:06] precious was it precious to you
[1:03:10] all humanly we cry we we feel like
[1:03:15] something's been taken from us how can
[1:03:18] the same event be so precious and so
[1:03:22] heartbreaking to
[1:03:23] us if we could break in and talk to our
[1:03:28] sister brother Randy told me the other
[1:03:30] day and I talked to him my wife Carol
[1:03:32] and I talked about the same thing I've
[1:03:34] heard it from two or three people that
[1:03:36] maybe one of the first ones that when
[1:03:39] our sister tresa was able to step across
[1:03:43] Paul likened death to a simple Journey
[1:03:46] he said the time of my
[1:03:49] departure is at hand the word that Paul
[1:03:52] used was a Greek word for shipping so it
[1:03:55] like the boat was tied to the Moorings
[1:03:59] the ropes were tied the boat had been
[1:04:03] loaded the captain was on board the
[1:04:06] merchants everything was in line and
[1:04:09] then all of a sudden they say let's
[1:04:13] go they loose the ropes from the big
[1:04:17] post which are buried feet in the ground
[1:04:19] and the ship begins to let go out into
[1:04:22] the waters and he said the time of my
[1:04:25] departure
[1:04:26] is at hand for just a moment before I
[1:04:29] close let us
[1:04:31] imagine our sister's heart rate begins
[1:04:34] to
[1:04:35] change her blood
[1:04:38] pressure she's getting to where she
[1:04:40] can't hear anymore and this Mortal
[1:04:43] realm skipping
[1:04:45] breaths she's never been here quite like
[1:04:48] this
[1:04:50] before but all of a sudden from another
[1:04:53] realm that realm becomes more real than
[1:04:57] this
[1:04:58] one and she feels
[1:05:00] herself as it were a vapor which is what
[1:05:03] the Bible says that we are like a vapor
[1:05:07] it begins to lift from the Earth's this
[1:05:10] body here like the morning
[1:05:13] fog and when the sun begins to shine
[1:05:16] upon it and it will cause it to just
[1:05:20] disappear in one moment she was in This
[1:05:23] Old House
[1:05:26] and the next moment she was on board the
[1:05:28] ship of
[1:05:30] Zion didn't take her 24 hours didn't
[1:05:34] take her 24
[1:05:35] minutes but just in a
[1:05:38] moment like as soon as she stepped into
[1:05:41] the
[1:05:47] ship and she disembarked the
[1:05:53] ship let's just watch her as she she
[1:05:56] steps
[1:05:59] out as she sets her foot upon the
[1:06:03] shore and she looks around and she sees
[1:06:06] colors like she's never seen
[1:06:10] before the sun was unlike anything she'd
[1:06:13] ever seen the skies the the
[1:06:18] grass and here comes somebody running
[1:06:31] there might have been
[1:06:33] several some from this
[1:06:35] side some from that side some from that
[1:06:41] side but I could see
[1:06:44] one maybe about that
[1:06:46] tall her long hair hanging Plumb down
[1:06:50] past her
[1:06:52] knees her arms out
[1:06:56] my precious
[1:07:00] sister who is
[1:07:02] it oh my
[1:07:04] goodness it's my daughter
[1:07:08] Erica sister tresa prayed for her so
[1:07:12] much there's another one and another one
[1:07:16] and another
[1:07:17] one and sister Trestle looks
[1:07:20] around and she
[1:07:24] realizes iaz made
[1:07:27] it I've made
[1:07:34] it I'm not sure that her and Erica have
[1:07:38] stopped running yet since she got
[1:07:44] there my friends if
[1:07:48] you and I could only be
[1:07:52] allowed a few minutes to see that land
[1:07:55] and what awaits
[1:07:57] us nothing we go through in this
[1:08:01] life would ever compare to that
[1:08:04] world to be honest with you I'm
[1:08:07] glad I can't really see that world all
[1:08:11] the
[1:08:13] time I catch glimpses of it every now
[1:08:16] and then when I preach a funeral or when
[1:08:18] I'm studying or
[1:08:20] praying but I'm glad that I I don't have
[1:08:23] constant access
[1:08:25] because it would make me why I would be
[1:08:27] so Heavenly minded I wouldn't be one bit
[1:08:30] of Earthly
[1:08:33] good but I know it's there waiting for
[1:08:39] us sister
[1:08:42] Tressa would you want to come
[1:08:46] back oh brother
[1:08:49] Donnie I've heard you preach about it so
[1:08:51] much I've heard other preachers preach
[1:08:53] about it but take my word word for it
[1:08:56] you don't have a
[1:08:58] clue what it's
[1:09:02] like I've already met the CH J's
[1:09:05] messenger I've met people from our
[1:09:07] church and the amazing thing about it is
[1:09:09] brother Donnie we're all the same
[1:09:12] age there's no babies there's no real
[1:09:15] old people we're all the same
[1:09:19] age it's just hard to imagine the
[1:09:21] flowers and the
[1:09:24] colors everything
[1:09:28] it's just I I don't have the
[1:09:31] word and I've experiened such love I I
[1:09:35] felt it from time to time in church and
[1:09:37] i' I'd feel it I could just feel a
[1:09:39] little bit of it but it is beyond
[1:09:44] comprehension sister Trester is there
[1:09:47] anything you'd want me to say to your
[1:09:52] family tell them to do everything they
[1:09:55] can
[1:09:56] to be
[1:09:59] ready tell them to meet
[1:10:02] me I'll be waiting for them at the
[1:10:06] river as God sent me some people down at
[1:10:09] the river to welcome
[1:10:12] me I'll be waiting for
[1:10:19] them may
[1:10:22] God and His Mercy comfort chch your
[1:10:26] hearts and help you as only he
[1:10:29] can I don't know exactly how you all
[1:10:32] feel today I've still had my wife but
[1:10:35] I've lost a mother a father Aunts Uncles
[1:10:39] a
[1:10:40] daughter but I know it may feel like
[1:10:43] that there's a hole in your heart there
[1:10:46] and nobody will ever be able to feel
[1:10:49] that for you and that is that is
[1:10:52] true but the Lord God can help Comfort
[1:10:55] us through these Hard Times until we're
[1:10:59] able to meet
[1:11:00] again may God bless each of you and
[1:11:03] strengthen you and help you is my prayer
[1:11:07] can we just bow our heads
[1:11:16] together I know this might seem unusual
[1:11:19] but with their heads bowed and no one
[1:11:21] looking around is there would there be
[1:11:23] anybody here today that would say I want
[1:11:26] to meet her
[1:11:28] but I'm I'm not I'm not ready really I
[1:11:31] know I'm
[1:11:32] not would you pray for me we won't
[1:11:35] embarrass you I promise
[1:11:37] you God bless you God bless
[1:11:43] you make
[1:11:45] preparation that wouldn't be my
[1:11:50] advice
[1:11:53] Hallelujah have hely father as
[1:11:59] we come to celebrate this
[1:12:02] life we know really that a Christian
[1:12:05] preaches their own
[1:12:07] funeral it's an honor to be able to
[1:12:09] stand and try to say something about
[1:12:12] your children that have lived a Godly
[1:12:14] life and been
[1:12:16] faithful Lord we prayed and we hoped and
[1:12:19] we believe that you would do a miracle
[1:12:22] for our sister and that you would let
[1:12:24] her live
[1:12:26] let her be able to enjoy her life and
[1:12:28] her children her
[1:12:30] grandchildren s Carol and I went to see
[1:12:32] her the other day and someone had made
[1:12:35] her a a little quilt a wrap of a thing
[1:12:38] and had all the pictures of the
[1:12:40] grandchildren on there and she was so
[1:12:43] proud of
[1:12:45] it but she didn't just love them here in
[1:12:48] life she wants to have them there
[1:12:52] too so I pray you'd help them Father
[1:12:56] help the parents to be able to instruct
[1:12:58] them Lord and tell them what to do so
[1:13:03] they can go where she is we can't bring
[1:13:05] her back and we wouldn't anyway we
[1:13:08] wouldn't want to call her back to this
[1:13:10] old
[1:13:12] body Lord God the best thing for us to
[1:13:14] do is just to make ready and stay ready
[1:13:18] so we can be able to meet
[1:13:20] her I pray for brother Randy I pray for
[1:13:23] the children I pray for their spouses
[1:13:26] the
[1:13:27] grandchildren the friends the other
[1:13:29] family members Lord some that couldn't
[1:13:31] even be here
[1:13:32] today for the church family God that you
[1:13:36] would help us that you'd give us
[1:13:38] strength
[1:13:39] Lord we thank you Father that there is a
[1:13:42] land beyond the river we thank you Lord
[1:13:46] Jesus that you made a way that this part
[1:13:49] of us which has been quickened to
[1:13:51] eternal
[1:13:53] life as a body that's there
[1:13:56] waiting thank you
[1:13:58] Father somewhere beyond the Jordan River
[1:14:01] there's a place Lord that we're longing
[1:14:04] to go and
[1:14:05] see help us today I pray
[1:14:08] father in the name of the Lord
[1:14:13] Jesus thank you
[1:14:17] Lord thank you
[1:14:21] Lord let me just say to you that
[1:14:27] by God's
[1:14:29] grace each one of us can make the same
[1:14:32] safe passage that our sister has made
[1:14:37] and if you want to go where she is
[1:14:39] you'll have to come through the same
[1:14:41] route and there's only one way and that
[1:14:44] way is a person it's not a preacher it's
[1:14:48] not a church but Jesus Christ himself
[1:14:52] said I am the way he he's not one of the
[1:14:56] ways but I am the way the
[1:15:00] truth and the
[1:15:02] life and if you don't know him
[1:15:04] today I just just feel strangely in my
[1:15:08] heart to say this to you
[1:15:10] that it's quite simple he made the way
[1:15:14] for us and we simply accept what he has
[1:15:17] done and follow his Commandments and his
[1:15:20] truths and his word and by that if we
[1:15:24] come by this way it will guarantee us a
[1:15:29] safe passage to the other side brother
[1:15:33] Ry buddy we love you going to be praying
[1:15:35] for you and the
[1:15:37] children is that right friends when we
[1:15:39] leave here today we're not just going to
