TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they compromised them when compromise comes Conduct changes the conduct leads to sin slavery then repentance then salvation then back to sin and back to repentance then that back to slavery back to repentance back to salvation and it brings corruption to the children of Israel it leads them and binds them in idolatry and immorality and we noticed this pattern just repeats over and over and over seven times and judges we see this pattern repeat the cycle of revival and death this getting away from God and living under the cursing of God but do you not want to know how to live under the blessing you see cursing or blessing is not a choice it's not you know like in school you have your you have your your required assignments then you have your extracurricular stuff you can just choose sort of an option if you want to do it or not well blessing or cursing don't work that way it's a required assignment you're either gonna live under the blessing of God or you're gonna live under the curse of God you say what would determinate your obedience to God or your disobedience to God as long as they live disobedient cursings followed their life but let me tell you something brother if they lived obedient blessings was that automatic blessings came automatically from God in fact the blessings were so great God said if you'll live close to my word and be obedient I'm not just gonna pour out blessings but those blessings are gonna become so strong in your life they overtake you you say what do they overtake they overtake your issues they overtake your problems they overtake your burdens they overtake your family they overtake your children oh they overtake your church and God says I'll bless you abundantly I'll pour out a blessing it'll be so big you can't even contain it I want that kind of a blessing here today I say gods that my life live so close to you that I live under the blessing of God
