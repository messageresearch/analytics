request prayer for his uncle he's in the hospital with breathing issues so let's remember that sister ruth louise jacks was recently involved in an automobile accident having problems with the insurance company settling so just asking god to intervene there and brother bert gravely had to be taken to the hospital not sure what's going wrong with him so he's just really not himself so just asking for him brother brad if you'll come with john taylor turned into request a fairly large blood clot has been discovered in his right leg after six weeks it's not absorbed the original origin is

manifested through that um sister sue miller turned in a testimony tonight and continued prayer requests for her son michael and fell off a roof about 14 feet working on his church last week he had two broken vertebrae three staple on his head many bruises still a lot of pain and very sore but all the doctors have just really went on about how lucky he is and we know that he's blessed we

that was so good it's a shame there wasn't 500 people in here to clap for that wasn't it um brother joe herrera is going to come preach for us tonight um has a song he wants brother harry to sing as he as he comes out so let's just sing this together as brother joe comes out hey you think she was a virgin bride to and one be as she lay quietly the spirit of the lord overshadowed her he said that you can see this child that sin cannot defy and she said be it unto me according to thy word she kept these things [Applause] and pondered them deep within her [Music] she believed in god when he said that something new was gone to start [Music] oh and if the world [Applause] then i believe it can be born in you and me now we're the virgin bride to be safe through the blood of calvary and in this time of darkness we have come [Music] and i can see being born in you and me [Applause] cause [Music] deep within our desire could be born [Applause] [Applause] me [Applause] cause we've kept these things and we believe them deep within our hearts we want to stay with this world [Music] i see being born in you and me thank you you hear me thank you if we're going to go to prayer for before we start if that's okay i got a text from brother gary on gloria while i was in there um he's positive for covet he's has tightness in his chest brother homer's doing some better but the homer's vitals are good um as long as he stays on the oxygen he's he's feeling better he's still got some coughs and he wanted to be tasked y'all remember his son josh he's having acl surgery i think this week so if you will just join me in prayer heavenly father we thank you for another time to serve you lord lord we look at the times around us father and we look at the the situation that we have to be in father with just a few people here but lord you said where two or three are gathered in my name there i'll be in their midst lord lord as this song was saying lord how lord that birth that you gave to to mary father you said that you would do that again in a little bride and lay ought to see you father lord i believe that i'm part of that bride these brothers and sisters they believe that they're part of that bride lord lord in the midst of laodicea when it's dark lord there's hardly any light you still have a bride father that will give birth to that word i'm so thankful lord let that word be birthed in my life let that word be birthed in the lives of of the church family here lord lord help us to be a testimony father that you have manifested yourself in a bride lord as we we study the word tonight lord as we bring it to the people lord i i pray that you'd help me get myself out of the way lord i i've studied these notes that i've had lord i've looked at him i've looked at the scriptures looked at quotes lord but when you walk out of here sometimes lord it just seems to wash all the way you can't think of anything to say lord but lord if you have control if you come and take over father i won't have to worry about that so i pray that you would come bless us tonight bless us with your presence bless everyone that's gathered everyone that's streaming lord you know the lives the needs of each one lord we welcome you here tonight we thank you in jesus name amen if you have your bibles we're going to open with the scripture colossians 3 i'll read verses 5 through 10. i tell brother bradley a while ago somebody asked me if i will be nervous i was preaching only about 10 people here i told them i preached to three one time and one of them stared out the window the entire service so this is a crowd so if you have your bibles colossians 3 5 and 10 mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanliness an ordinance affection evil whatever that word is covetousness which is idolatry for which things say the wrath of god cometh out of the children of a disobedience in the which you also walk sometime when you lived in them but now you also put off these all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and when you put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him you can be seated i have a my title tonight is resurrection of the new man thank you i know brother donnie's been speaking on this the last three four weeks the new man and the the seed life and i promise you i've had these notes since summer so i i haven't um i told brother jim bab today i'll try to bring it a little different well i promise you would be different you know what brother tommy brought it but hopefully you could we can get something out of it tonight brother branham said in 61 and why unless a grain of corn falls in the ground and rots unless a man rots to his own theology lest you rot into the methodist theology unless you rot into baptist theology unless you rot into pentecostal theology until you rot to those things and give yourself into the hands of god then the old man will die and the new man will be born christ jesus we will rise glory and the power and the resurrection of christ and the life that was in christ will be in you and these signs shall follow them that believe that's why the matter yes that's where it's at tonight since there's only a few people i mean i would if y'all would a man a little bit loud you know brother terry's not here no longer brother west so you know it really helps um i if y'all could just let me know you're out there and sometimes like brother donnie says i can't hear a nod but this is definitely different i will say this is different but i appreciate the the pull but paul's saying we have a new man if anybody knew that more than anybody paul knew that paul knew that there was a new man when he got on the road to damascus when jesus came and came to him and paul had a revelation paul's biggest revelation was of the old man paul hated that old man for the rest of his life for what he had done he persecuted christians he'd done all these things and that paul if you read in colossians in galatians and in corinthians different paul is talking about how he's crucified himself with christ paul he says i die daily all these things that paul says and looking back over colossians he says mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication and cleanliness inordinate affection evil concuptuants covetness covetness which is idolatry mortify is to put to death to view as a corpse paul says these things that's in your life these things that hinder your your mortal body this is what i want you to put to death because long as these things live in your life that new man can never manifest himself that new man will always stay buried you know we come up here all the time we have we have baptisms up here all the time and we know it in symbolism it's a death burial and resurrection the old man is dies and is buried and a new man comes up we know that baptism doesn't save you within itself it doesn't make a new man out of you within itself it's all symbolism but we understand that and the scriptures instruct us to do that but you gotta understand the symbolism of that is exactly what paul is saying you have to kill this old man you have to kill him you know i was teasing with joel this this weekend you know we're talking about brother tim burdett singing that song you know the old man is dead i said you know i'm going to write a new one it's called the old man is on the ventilator because people don't want to kill him people do not want to kill him they want to keep him alive just enough if they need him so paul is saying and put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him renewed is to be changed into a new kind of life as opposed to the former corrupt state that's kind of similar to the word they use regenerate regen his brother brother donny says so paul spoke with this battle between this old man and this new man more than anybody else in the bible he never realized there was a new man until his conversion he thought he was the new man paul thought that whenever he was going through persecuting the christians when he was holding stephen's guard the coach of the men that stoned stephen but this was the new man this was the man that was going to to take the gospel to everybody and and if you didn't believe it the way he believed they were going to kill you this was paul's idea but you got to realize you can't force this new man into your life people get to thinking if if i act better if i live a better life if if if i force myself not to do my old habits if i force myself not to drink if i force myself not to smoke if if i force myself you know i'm bitter towards this brother let's bring it up into the message now just because you don't drink and you don't smoke and you don't swear that don't mean you still don't have old man that's still alive satan's going to make sure that you remember that whether he's dead or not in your life satan's going to make sure that you know he's there he's going to remind you he's going to make you think even if you fill up the holy ghost and the new man which we'll find out later paul says he is christ but brahm said that that new new man that manifests himself in your life is christ it's not you anyway you can't force christ into your life you can't force yourself to have the holy ghost so just acting better just just trying to do away with the bad habits in your life you've had bitterness against his brother this sister for so long and you thought well i'm going to act better around them it's still there you just got the old man on a breathing machine he's still there you can't force it you have to kill him that's what paul's saying and brother branham says unless you rot until you rot to those things and give yourself into the hands of god then the old man will die when you take these things in your life you take the things that beset you you know just because you have the holy ghost doesn't mean that you don't have things that beset you you've heard that a million times in this in this church it does not de-christianize you because you have faults and you have mistakes that's part of his flesh if if the rapture was to come in in a split second you might make a mistake one split second before the rapture takes place that's humanity that's this flesh but you're going to a glorified body your theophany will come back and pick up a glorified body that new man will come back and pick up a glorified body that'll never make another mistake that'll it'll never need be healed that will never um sin in any way paul says in first corinthians 15 31 i protest by your rejoicing which i i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily paul died daily because he was daily reminded himself it was always i this is my opinion that paul always had in the back of his mind everything he'd done the people that god was sending him to now were the people that he killed the ones that he persecuted and paul says i have to die daily i have to remind myself that old man is no longer me with satan come to remind you of your mistakes all the time everything you've done and you sat and dwelled on that constantly you think that that life of jesus christ and you would rise up and be victorious if you was constantly dwelling on your past if you was constantly dwelling on the mistakes that you had in your life satan's going to remind you forget it he's going to remind you when you get the holy ghost and you feel like you come in one of these services and and you get filled with the holy ghost and you walk and you walk out that door and you feel like my life is renewed i'm regenerated the new man is manifested in my life and probably so but do not think that you're going to have that feeling you might not even have feeling the rest of the night it might leave you soon as you walk out the back door satan's going to remind you yeah but before you came to church you did this before you before yesterday you got to fight with your wife you did this you did this at work you you said this you looked at this you thought of this it's always going to be there but you have to keep your mind satan that's not me that's that's the old man and that's what paul said i die daily i die to myself i keep killing that old man daily i keep burying him but every time you bury him there's a resurrection there there cannot be a death without a resurrection if you're a seed of god that death is going to bring forth the resurrection no doubt it haunted him every day no i'd say paul nobody hated their past more than paul did you look at the worst things you've done in your life can you can you think i mean did you kill anybody have you did you persecute christians and hunt them down and kill them and torture them throw them in prison nobody's done that but this is the man that had to live with that every day in galatians 2 20. paul said i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live paul crucified the old man paul says i'm crucifying him nevertheless i live but not i but christ liveth in me paul was saying me paul i died i crucified the resurrection was christ in his life it wasn't him he said it's not me it's christ it's christ that liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me he had a revelation that the new man was christ it was the seed life of christ being manifested in paul your we're sons and daughters by predestination you know we all we believe in predestination we believe that before the foundation of the world god had a thought of you and that when you was born he took that first breath of life and god placed that seed of life of himself inside of you and paul's saying this has become manifested in my life we've got to realize you know when satan keeps throwing the old man at us i mean when you're born you're born into flesh you're born in flesh shaped iniquity you came to the world speaking lies do you realize the new man and you came first this old man wasn't first the new man was first that new man of you was in god's thoughts before the foundation of the world only thing this does right here is transport him around you're eternal the real you the new man in your life is eternal it cannot be any other way but that because christ is eternal and paul says that new man in me is christ brother braham said that new man in you is christ it's not you so you can't work it up you can't try to to live right try trying to live right that's good morally that's a great thing to do morally try try to live right but you got to understand human trying human effort does not bring forth the new man it's yielding it's submitting yourself to god you're saying god i i can't i can't do away with this i can't take this out of my life i've struggled this with this for years i can't i can't take it away there's people even myself you know you have habits in your life that you've had your life that you tried and tried and tried mentally physically trying to stop on your own you might go a month or two you might go a year or two and then it keeps coming back because it was you putting forth the effort and it wasn't you yielding to the new man saying if i let this new man manifest himself in my life it won't be my efforts anymore it won't be me trying to get rid of it anymore it won't be me trying to live this life you can't live this life you can try your best to live a christian life you pick up this book and you start reading this book and you say i'm going to live everything i read in this book you'll be so confused if you read this with human understanding human intelligence you'll be so confused you won't know what you're doing right or wrong that that's that's the the issue that you know brother and i'm saying let the methodist theology rot let the baptist theology rot let the joelology rot let the hairy ology rot let it rot because it won't do you a bit of good until you've got the theology of the new man in your life teaching you how to yield teaching you how to let to let go of that old man to bury him to stab him to kill him blow his head off whatever you have to do but that's what you gotta that's what paul is telling us to do crucify yourself with christ paul says i crucified i'm crucified with christ we have to be we have to nail the old man to the tree just like paul did we can't resuscitate him we can't put him on a villain for later you know that's that's like taking things in your life and go and put them in a closet instead of destroying them you've got to sell out if you were in a stop before the foundation world the new man has no choice but to come to fruition in your life i promise you if you were in the thoughts of god before the foundation of the world that new man will eventually manifest in your life he's got no choice because it's a part of god it's a piece of god that little part that little seed we'll get into the seed part here in a minute but that little seed that god placed in you when you took your first breath of life you know brother brother brandon i'm telling the story about that 90 year old woman she said he led her to christ when she was 90. that seed of life laid in her for 90 years when she took she was predestinated it took her 90 years for the new man to manifest itself in her life 90 years and there's people you see people come to church and don't get what they feel like they should get within a month and they leave and never come back you've got to understand just because just because you know there's things getting not revealed to you people give up because i they say i can't see it i don't know what this woman was i have no idea what denomination she belonged to but evidently what she was believing wasn't right and then god sent a prophet her way and said there's a new man in there there's somebody else in there and so what quickened that new man in this 90 year old woman's life what manifested it was watering of the word she heard the word it watered that seed and that seed came underneath the basking of the sun and that's 90 years old a seed comes to life thank you you know if if you go by the way of the grave if god takes us by the way of the grave you're filled with the holy ghost you have the holy ghost in your life and god and you die you we have a promise of a resurrection god promised you a resurrection if you die amen everybody believe that so if you die in your resurrection you come back in another body you're victorious over everything the body that you're now in is victorious there's no more death there's no more sickness there's no more depression there's no more financial troubles there's there's nothing there's no bitterness there's no hatred there's no nothing so and then that's what you will find in the rapture in the resurrected body if you go by the way of the grave do you realize you do not have to wait till you're resurrected to have that when that old man dies and there's a resurrection of a new man in your life you have the same victory over all of those things that a resurrected raptured body would have brother branham said if jesus stood right here in my suit and you come up here to get prayed for he couldn't heal you he said he couldn't heal you anymore because it's already done everything that you ever needed if you're a predestinated son or daughter of god everything that you ever needed it's already been done it's by faith it's it's a walk of faith and paul says i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me so i don't care to crucify myself with him i don't care to kill the old man because i i know that it's not me that that's living the new man is not me it's christ living you've got to let christ live in your life you've got to let the life of christ be predominant in your life more than anything else and paul says only way you could do that is by faith faith in the son of god he's never failed when you have the new man in your life everything that you would have in a resurrected body you already have with the resurrection of the new man in your life he'll never fail he's never felt anything he's ever said he would do he's done it he can't go back and finish something because he already finished it you know we had situation here at our church several years ago you know threats and stuff because things that were said here and after about six seven months eight months i don't know maybe even a year i was driving by one day and i just felt pressed up on my heart to come pray for brother jimmy brother jimmy was catching the brunt of all of it mostly and and i walked into the library and i might have said that here before this before i don't know i walked into the library and i said brother jimmy just something is pulling on my heart to come in here and pray with you so me and brother jimmy had prayer and he told me long sometime later he said things started to change he said it it happened well this past year you know we we got some more you know i had some people calling me and telling me you know hey this is possibly going to happen at your church and all this and and from that that point on and i would tell whoever would i text i had texts i had phone calls and man i appreciated it but i told them whoever whoever would call me and tell me i said god has never started a work he hasn't finished when prayer was made god took that away but that does not mean satan's not going to throw a bluff up in your face that does not mean that satan is not just because you overcome one battle that don't mean satan ain't going to try to throw the same battle at you he don't accept it throw his hands up well he's good at that i'm not going to pack him with that no more that's not the way it works but god will never incomplete a work he always finishes everything he starts and he does it well so you you know when we look at look people dealing with covid we look at people dealing with cancer in their lives right now and we look at it and we you know we pray we pray and we pray and we seem like we struggle through the prayer lord when's this going to change god's got everything under control don't don't look at it and think well god didn't do that maybe god's got a greater plan than your prayer god's got something working more in your prayer that new man in your life maybe he needs the old man needs a little bit more killing first so looking at looking at that you know at the things that's happening around us today politics it's all corrupt but i trust you know as time comes down because you look at the signs of the time i've i've had i've had people that don't know the thing about this message tell me signs this is the signs of the time the end time this can't go i mean people that you have no idea what they believe what they don't believe and they're telling you this is the end time the signs are everywhere but in the in the body of the new man that's manifested in your life you don't have to look at that you know when the children of israel when all the plagues were going through through egypt there was no plagues in goshen when there was gross darkness in egypt there was light and goshen god's still going to shine a little light on this bride god's still going to manifest himself his seed life in this bride it don't matter to me that's what gives me the greatest joy that it does not matter what happens in the world around me it's the life that i have inside it'll keep you through it all if you have that life if you don't have that life if you're still counting on this old man to pull you through these hard times you better pull the plug on him because he's going to fail you you have to kill him spoken word is original seed i put a note down here it said natural the natural type now therefore true life can come can only come or re reproduce itself by its original breeding now study that when you're studying the tapes study it now life l-i-f-e can only be reproduced by its original breeding the way it started in the beginning then it reproduces itself what is the the seed life in you that's god re reproducing himself that's what he did with mary he produced a body that he himself can come into and this word will do the exact same thing as it did to mary this this word will water that seed that s-o-n will shine on that seed and that seed will give birth to life that's christ reproducing himself and you and in me you know when i was studying this you know i was studying it you know how god had a vision in his mind and his thoughts brother branham so often how we've heard it brother branham said you know you were in god's thought before the foundation of the world you know and he had a perfect image of what he wanted you to be he had a perfect idea in his mind this this is exactly what i want brother harry to be this right here is the very image brother harry no matter what you've done in life no matter the mistakes you've done anything you've done in your life god has never lost that perfect image of you he's never had another image in you and i was thinking of this in in a matter of of speaking naturally when my when my dad and my mom gave birth to me i was the best kid they ever had i don't care what any of them tell you but my when my dad when i was born when my dad was born he had a vision in his mind that that when i got older you know this is what he wanted me to be naturally speaking that don't mean that was going to happen but he still had a vision he still had a thought of what he wanted me to be now as you know kid growing up my dad was my hero my dad is even more my hero now because i can see now the things that my dad sacrificed things that he gave up for me as a child you don't see that you don't understand things in your in your parents life they go through as a child so you know when i was born i couldn't look at my dad and say one day i'm going to look just like him i had no idea he had an idea he had an idea what i mean he's not god but he had an idea that one day i would be pretty much his image i didn't know that you didn't know that when you came into this world you didn't you know and god had this image in your mind his mind you might have been lost in sin for the first 30 years of your life you had no idea that god had this image of you in his mind so growing up you know and i look at my dad to me my dad was was the the biggest the strongest the fastest the baddest man in hardy arkansas there were some bad dudes there in in in my mind you know growing up you hear people tell you you have your dad's eyes you have your dad's nose you have you have your dad's smile but as you grow as a child and you grow and and then as you get older you start to see little manifestations in your life that look like your father your natural father you know it's it's nothing that's planned out you know i could i could have been you know i could look like my mom it might have been better than looking like my dad but at some point i i get into the full revelation of what my dad wanted of me it might have took 30 40 50 years but spiritually speaking and the same thing god had this image of each one of us in his mind before the foundation world it's always been there the thought of you has never not been in god's mind it's never not been there that's what brother said brother braham said you came from eternity you go back to eternity because that that image has always been there so in order for me to manifest gary hara in myself i had to become a different person i didn't look like him when i was a toddler i didn't really look like him when i was a teenager i had to come full manifestation of what he thought i would one day be i had to become a new man i had to become a man i wasn't this little child was the old man i got my tail busted a bunch because i made mistakes i did things i shouldn't have done but then i had to become a new person i had to become a new creature paul says therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new and this word new says as respects form recently made fresh recent unused unworn new which is recently made is superior to what succeeds and this i put a note down here unworn is as a new garment putting on new clothes throwing away the old clothes we see this picture in the prodigal son we see the prodigal the old man left he said give me what's mine i'm going to go make it on my own i'm going to become this is good so we see how that worked out for paul i mean for the prodigal son he left he said give give me everything that's mine and i'll leave so he the old man he's leaving the old man is leaving but what did the father say when he come back he said my son that was dead the son that had died he's now alive the father testified that there was a resurrection so what's he going to do he's going to clothe him in new garments that are unworn it's new he's alive he was lost but now he's found he was dead this is the parable of a resurrection in this young man's life you know when god changes you when god takes that takes that away from you you become a new creature like i said before no doubt paul was haunted daily by his mistakes but god puts it in see if forgetfulness never to be remembered you know if we could forget you know when the devil brings up things to us in our lives we can tell him satan i didn't do that i didn't do that that wasn't me that was the old man you know i i had the privilege of coming in here one night and with the young people and they've been going through the series the chosen have y'all everybody heard the chosen and in this particular one it really struck out to me stuck out to me because it had mary who jesus had cast seven devils out you know in the storyline in the movie that show it tells how nicodemus had met with with mary and was going to get rid of these demons for was going to cast them off and it didn't work and in the movie it shows him talking to the people in the sanhedrin and he said i'm going to go investigate this i'm gonna go find out what happened to her and i'll get back with you so he comes up to mary and he starts calling her by her old name lilith and then what stuck out to me is when he starts calling her by her name her old name she don't comprehend she don't know who that person is she forgot god forgot and then he starts reminding her what had happened to her she had no idea she had forgot she couldn't remember it she was now a new person she said that's not my name my name is mary that's just like the devil coming to you all the time telling you you've done this you can tell him that's the old man that's not me you know if if satan if satan gets us focused on the old man so often if he if he gets you to keep your focus there you can it's hard to grow you know you watch people sometimes battling things and and sometimes and coming at church and they sit there and the the service is going forth the anointing is moving and they sit there blank sometimes they sit there and they and they and they wallow in their in their depression and they they waller in their issues they got it home and and everywhere else when the greatest source they have is coming from right up here and they sit there and and don't get involved and and they don't pull on the gift and they don't they don't ask the lord lord i need i mean this is the time that you need something more than any time and they sit there and they wallow in their in their their self-pity yeah you're going through things everybody's going through things but this is where you get help this on sunday and saturday and wednesday you come in and you get under the watering of the word that's what helps that seed life of that new man grow there's no growth there's no resurrection you're not going to resurrect a new man by focusing on your issues focusing on your problems when you should be focusing on the one that can fix him brother braham says not because your father was something it's what are you every man's got to be born again i'm losing time i'm going to have to skip some stuff a new man every man got to be born again and this sinful nature killed in him and a new man born in him which is christ jesus the son of god bill abraham said that new man that is born in you is christ jesus it's not you as a better person morally you're not better because you're trying to do better what makes you better is christ living in you christ the hope of glory then you surrender yourself completely to christ and christ comes in and writes a book of acts through you how i know that's the truth my friend how i know it's the truth so how do we know there's a new man living in us how do you know where where does the life come from where does the life of this new man come from like i said we can't work it up we can't we can't sit there and conjure it up and and and pump it and prime it like brother brand i'm talking you should talk about you get one of my wells and you try to prime it up you can't you can't prime the holy ghost into your life it's a gift how do you get that gift by yielding i'll jump ahead here i apologize i'm running out of time first john 3 8 he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him god's seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god that's a perfect example of the new man god's seed in you birthing in you as a seed of god so what's a seed children offspring prodigy family race prosperity whatever possesses vital force of life-giving power or life-giving power the holy spirit the divine energy operating within the soul by which we are regenerated you know when studying this when i was studying got into studying the seed life and brother branham refers to it a lot in different sermons and you know we've always we've heard for for years you know and it's it's a wonderful it would only take the the mind of a prophet or god revealing it to a prophet that that you was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world how about you when you was in his thoughts and that thought when you took your first breath of life god took that thought and dropped it into your into your soul only a prophet could know that you know i mean we we we read in in the scriptures you know that paul and him touch on it to an extent but in this last age we got a deeper look into the mind of god we got a deeper look into where we came from you know and looking at that you know i never didn't understand it for years so when i when i put this together now i i don't hear audible voices speak to me when i'm studying i never have probably never will it just comes as thoughts when i was studying this lord is probably two three months ago and thought came to me you know how to understand god dropping a thought whenever i come out of the womb in my first breath of life and god sets that seed down in there you know and i used looked at an example of an oak tree i'm gonna put this on first grade level so i can understand look at an oak tree i got to looking at oak trees this week you know they say some of them grow over 100 feet tall they'll live from anywhere from 120 to 150 years some people say they live almost a thousand years but the oak tree is both male and female they have what they call male flowers and female flowers in the the the seed comes out of the the female flower and the pollen from the male flower pollinates it and it forms an acre and just like the thought of god that big old hundred foot oak tree drops an acre into the dirt now if that acorn had any intelligence this here comes the first grade level if it had two eyeballs and it could look up at this big hundred foot eight oak tree and and look at that and say wow that is a big tree my daddy is huge and be amazed at the size of this tree that gave birth to him but that's all he knows he has no idea every single piece of dna that's in that tree is in him he has no idea now studying this an acorn can't really thrive underneath the branches of an oak tree it requires animals rat rodents squirrels whatever to pick up that acorn and carry it off somewhere or rain to wash it away to put it through some trials it'll fall into the river you may get washed 100 miles down the river in a flood will come and as the flood comes the water rises and this acre and gets washed up on the bank and it lands in some soil and it gets buried still has no idea he is or what he is where he came from he just knows he's got a big daddy that's all he knows he has no idea that one day he'll look exactly like him he'll look just like that big old tree so is this this little acre and this little seed goes into the ground winter comes and all he sees is darkness dirt piled around him and it gets cold and hard there's no life there we've all been there even with the holy ghost in your life you've gone through them moments in your life where you feel no growth everything around you is cold and hard and dark you're going to go through those times and as this little acorn lays there eventually spring will roll around and you'll feel the dampness in the earth you feel something get warm it feels a little stimulation inside of him something inside of him will begin to move it may be slow and gradual it might take him service after service after service of the watering but begins to grow and he feels movement around him you've got to understand when a seed is in the ground there's nutrients in the ground that help that seed to grow there's nutrients in there there's calcium there's potash petroleum different things that help this seed grow now in studying that i got to thinking about that you know just because there's things in our life we see it all the time you know i call these nutrients gifts we've got god allows nutrients in our life to stimulate growth but they are not the life god allows speaking in tongues he lies laying on hands the gift of preaching the gift of singing the gift of songwriting the gift of plain music that's not the life it's a nutrient god put in the soil so when we we glorify them things you're glorifying dirt that's that's something that god put in the dirt in the dirt to stimulate the growth of the life but that is not the life when you give glory to how well you preach or whoever got healed because you laid hands on them because you speak in tongues because you can write a song because you can sing a song you're glorifying dirt god allows that there that's for the body that's that's to grow those are nutrients just like the stimulate this little acorn seed in the ground stimulate it to grow but as this thing begins to grow the outer laying of this acorn this seed begins to die in order to growth the outer layer has to die it has to rot it has to be buried for the life on the inside to come out and when that thing becomes an oak tree you can dig the china and you'll never find one piece of that old man or that seed you'll never find one cell of it because it's a new man so is this acorn as this acre and lays there and it begins to grow and eventually he comes out and as he comes out he hears something say good morning and it's the sun it's the s-u-n do you think that little acre and jumped up and said i've been searching for you for so long son rain i've been looking for you all my life that little seed had no idea that existed the sun says i was here all the time the entire time you were in the ground through your dark times through the times where you didn't know where the cold was coming from where the dark was coming from through those times i was here i shone during the dark times i shown deer in the cold times i was right here and that seed begins to grow but it has to go through things you know the life inside that seed thirsted for something had no idea what it was he didn't have no idea the song was there people telling you they they searched for god they got on their knees and searched for god that's how they came to the message because they were searching for god and and they found god never happened they didn't find god no more than this seed found the sun it don't work that way if you were already in the mind of god god knew where you were the whole time though this flesh might have been lost the old man might have had you lost god knew where he was the whole time romans 8 10 11 and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you he he raised up christ from the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies by his flesh that dwelleth in you this seed was quickened you know whenever people say you know speaking in tongues and you know back on the nutrients thing again you know that speaking in tongues is is you know a lot of people say it's the gift of the holy ghost which we know it ain't pentecostals believe that and some of them trying to transition over into the message you know it's not it's not wrong to have those things it's not wrong to ask for these nutrients these stimulants in your in your life you remember the the sister that brother branham told about that she had the holy ghost brother brown says she had the holy ghost but she can't believe it so brother branham told her to go pray and ask god to give you the gift of speaking in tongues ask god to give you this stimulant that will help the growth of that life you know there's people that might have to do that but we can't place glory in this in this soul and that seed in order for the grow will have to continue to sit under the washing of the water of the word we'll have to bask in the sunlight to have growth and then eventually we'll come into the image of the big father oak that's the same thing in our life you know we come in here and you know i know what's different with covet and all that and you have a lot of most people just about everybody has to sit at home but it's still the word i know it's a different atmosphere it's still the word you know and i understand brother donny he hates having to do this because when you've got a whole group of believers in here pulling it makes a huge difference it makes a huge difference and i'd say it makes a difference with a singing and everything as well but still we have to get under that watering of the word so whose life is inside you who is the life that's inside you souls that are in prison now but that soul in there see that soul is what god is working on see if he can get that nature that spirit to agree with him then that nature dies the nature and the love of the world dies the things of the world is dead if you love the world the things of the world the love of the father is not the love of god is not in you a man must be born again so this nature has to die and the nature of god comes in and lives in you and god is the only thing there is that never did begin or never can end therefore he has partnership you see and taken this man earthly and this eternal spirit and put it together it's taken your earthly body and this eternal spirit and made it one that's the only way you're going to have the life if god done that when you when you receive the holy ghost god took this earthly body and the holy spirit and put him together because god reflected himself back in that he become a man when he became jesus christ and he was god see he was in christ lived in him reconciling the world to himself and through that perfect man each one of us imperfect we're all imperfect this flesh is imperfect each one of us imperfect that believing god has accepted us has accepted that and we become the perfection of him when that life manifests in you that new man that seed manifests in you you become the perfection of god that's all god that that is god's main purpose is to have a bride that is him nothing short of that that that's god's greatest desire the greatest desire that god could look down through eternity and you look at yourself everybody take a look at yourself and think me why would god the great creator of all this earth feel like that he can take this body and be perfect in this body in johara's body if i want to reflect on the old man i can say lord look what i've done i can say that but god says i don't have no image of that i've never seen that but that's what satan wants you god says i want you to be my perfection satan says you'll never be his perfection long as you keep looking at the old man and you never water the seed of life that's down on the inside if you never water that if you never read if you never pray if you're not listening to the word how are you going to have growth everything's going to that seed is going to go back into a dark cold state in the ground you won't have growth that way so in order to become the perfection of god i've never heard this quote before but brother branham said we've become the perfection of him when the holy spirit god places that in you the holy spirit into an imperfect body it's like the that's just like the ink in the bleach when god puts that holy spirit in that imperfect body there's no more imperfection there's no more it's all the imperfections are gone when that new man takes over we become his perfection god refuses god refuses i don't know how to put this he cannot and will not be perfect without you he refuses to be perfect without you our human minds cannot comprehend god's desire because we we try to put our minds at such a high level of thinking this is the way god must think and we we put it so far out of reach and god says it's right down here in simplicity it's so simple all i want is to live in you and me and you be perfect together i want my seed life to grow in you but our human minds can't comprehend that a god so great would think that low it's as simple as a lie as a seed being planted in the ground rain falling on it in the spring sun shining on in the spring through the summer and it grows that's how simple god wants to make it that's the only way i can understand it how many times we heard brother brahm say the natural types of spiritual so many times it types of spiritual you know god didn't god didn't do that for you because he felt sorry for you god didn't feel sorry for you god didn't do you i was i was watching the old victorian show sometime in this this peasant woman this this noble guy fell in love with this peasant woman any and he married her and the whole time she would talk to her friends you know when he went around the whole time she felt like she owed him so much she thought that he did me a favor by marrying me because he felt sorry for me and so one of these noble men came to her and she was giving this little speech to him about you know i'll never be good enough for him and he said he didn't do you a favor by marrying you he didn't do you a favor he did it out of pure undying love nothing short of that god didn't look at you and say there's a dirty old peasant woman i need to rescue her the very first image that god ever had in you in his mind was a pure white without blemish clean bride that's how he looked at you he's never seen you in any other way i don't know how many much clearer i can make that god has never seen you imperfect so why are we constantly saying god i did this i fell short here i did this feeling sorry for ourselves and god you're saying something to god that he don't know anything about god don't understand that from you god wants you to get the same image in your mind that he has in his that's the way this bride's gonna get out of here when this bride gets the same image of who she is i'm clean i'm spotless i'm perfect i'm unblameable nothing i did in my past said no one can blame me for that if god says you didn't do it who is greater than god who is any greater and then we sit there and we waller in our sins things we did in the past i've said it here before if you bring up your past you have to reach into hell and pull it out because that's where god put it when you ask forgiveness for something god throws in the sea of forgetfulness he sends it back to hell where it came from then you want to go dig the old man out of hell and put him on a breathing machine that's what we do but god said get the image that i had in you i promise you when everybody and every member of this bride gets the image that god has of them in in their soul we're leaving nothing's going to keep her you know why we let's go ahead and stand it's a life that comes with it there's something about that life that recognizes life god recognizes that life of himself and you just the spoken word look at elizabeth whenever mary come to her and spoke the word to her but brahman said the spoken word and john leaped in her womb who was dead it's a life that recognizes life we're no different we're no different you might not be a prophet you may not be a preacher but you're exactly what god wants you to be you're exactly where god wants you to be you know you i never understand why people want to preach i i never unders never understood it ever since i that i felt the calling in my life it just blows my mind if people want to preach but i'm where god wants me to be if i preach once a year once three years once every five years that makes no difference to me i'm exactly where god wants me to be if we ever realize the life that is in us it doesn't matter what satan throws at us covet cancer depression bitterness it doesn't matter what kind of sickness what kind of disease we've got nothing to worry about everything i was talking about the oak tree earlier everything in your life everything that you have in your life in the in the life of that new man you're victorious over it you've got nothing else to worry about you know look look at if you look at anybody seen the the message the brother tim pruitt just preached and showed the x-rays lady in his church he put up two x-rays i watched it last night he put two x-rays up side by side this lady this whole lung entire lung was black with cancer she came to church when prayed for went and got an x-ray and it's all gone every bit of it and the cancer took almost her whole lung that comes from the life that's the end the life healing is in the life if you've got cancer you got healing it's already there it's already done you know once you receive that life that new man anything that satan puts up between you and that promise that's a bluff that that's a blood you don't have to worry about it no more take him for what he is the same god that he healed sister becky johnson killed sister cynthia healed sister erica it's the same god why what is it it's the life it's the it's in the dna you can't help from being healed it's already in there healing is in the life you struggle with depression you want peace and joy it's in the life get in here and get watered let it grow brother can we sing i'm going a little over i apologize can we sing uh why should i worry we've got nothing to worry about not a thing let me have a word of prayer first brother if you don't mind if you have a knee there you in your homes here if you have a need just put that before the lord we're going to pray heavenly father lord i pray if no one else lord that you make this sermon a realization and revelation in my life lord i i understand so many times satan wants us to focus lord on that old man he wants us to focus on the things in our life that stumble us to focus on on sickness on covet on cancer on the things that's in people's lives lord jesus things that hinder us but lord when your prophet said that he took this imperfect body and lord he put his holy spirit in it we become the perfection of him in the perfection of you there is no cancer that's all healing in the perfection of you there's deliverance in the perfection of you lord there's salvation there's overcoming power there's peace and joy we don't have to take the symptoms of the old man lord we can grasp hold of the promise of the new man lord every need that's here lord
