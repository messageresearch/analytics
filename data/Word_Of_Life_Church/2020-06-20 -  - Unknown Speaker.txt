praise the Lord for the valleys and the mountains and all the different things that come our way as children of God for those of you that are streaming tonight you haven't heard feel the folks sure if the church got sick with the kovat and we're going to be kind of reverting back to this or maybe maybe a couple of weeks we want to try to watch over those who haven't got it and hopefully we can keep them from it by the help of the Lord but we will certainly do our best I think that during during this time we'll probably go ahead and have Wednesday night Saturday night and Sunday morning and instead of just doing the two we probably need three right now I don't know we might need five or six services right now but everything that's going on but we'll try out three and then see how that goes so service will be normal time and when we have in it three times a week so we'll probably just be streaming for the next couple of weeks we're shooting for hopefully by the grace of the Lord maybe run the 1st of July 1 we'll be able to gather back together after these that have been tested positive and those that they've been around and we have to give them a little bit of time for this Saint attendant kind of run its course well we certainly appreciate your prayers and trust that you'll enjoy the services and it's not the same of course if y'all not being here and it's not the same with you not being here I know that but I'm grateful that we have this under the difficult time that we have would like to read again tonight from 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 and word I really didn't know whenever I was preaching on Sunday that we would be tested and tried but what we was probably was hearing Monday whenever I begin to hear about the different folks that had got sick and different ones that wasn't feeling very well I actually got sick myself I just got so physically sick and I just felt I felt awful just thinking that was going to have to cancel Church again I know I'm weird I'm strange but I love to go to church God saved me to go to the house of God I know some of you folks think streaming it's the same thing well the Bible don't agree with you the Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and there's something about being the house of God and I'll take him I just it just really been weighing heavy on me in the last couple three days and all this so we just trusted everybody will come through it and there'll be no lasting lasting results that'll be there and so the rest of you just be mindful of us in prayer if you would let's read a great paradox 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me let me read that again and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee now we know that he could just as easily said it'll be gone tomorrow or in three days from now it'll be gone but instead of saying that he said my grace is sufficient so we know whenever he says that there's a divine reason for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory and my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me therefore I take pleasure and infirmities and reproaches in necessities in persecutions we all say god help us and de-stresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am i strong let us bow our heads together I just got an update just before I came out a few moments ago on brother Wade and mr. Waite said that he was doing pretty good except for his ability to swallow him just real difficult for him to swallow so let's remember him if it we can Heavenly Father we counted such an honor Lord Jesus that we can be gathered together here again of God we realize on Wednesday night some are gathered around the bar room and some are gathered Heavenly Father in the gambling dens and some are gathered in all types of wicked places but Lord Jesus we thank you that we can be gathered around the reveal word of this hour as we see the darkness as it's pressing its way closer and closer and closer yet makes us appreciate the light of God more than ever before we've said it all along that we need you but Lord God that is becoming more evident every day that live we live in this world the people around us are going insane they don't know what's right they don't know what's wrong Lord we would have never thought our nation would be paralyzed by a virus and never thought there's some of the things that's happened in the last two weeks would happen to us Lord the Lord God we know it's all signs of your coming we pray father that you would help us as your bride that we could be ready Lord we pray for her by the way darlin tonight Lord that you just helped our brother you see father am still not able to swallow Ryan having this surgery in his neck may the Spirit of God move for him be mindful of all of those Lord that are sick and suffering we pray for our brothers and sisters around the world Lord God Africa India different places that are suffering Lord in a terrible way because of this virus may the Spirit of God move form father we s we need you again tonight lord I pray that should help us Oh Lamb of God may the presence of God help me that I can be able to get out of the way and Lord God use that part of yourself that you placed in me father to speak to your people we love you about all of our hearts for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask amen god bless you brothers you may be seated certainly appreciate the brothers coming and helping us tonight the musicians and Deacon brothers brother Louie the song leader it's a blessing to us to be able to to know a symbol like this even though we're just a handful and been able to meet in the presence of God but we know the Lord Jesus whenever he came he didn't tell us that have to be a building full it's starting to be hurtin if it was many many times what we're so grateful that he promised that he would be with us in our great hour of need we want to pick up again tonight if the Lord would help us and been looking at this on the canosa of our Lord in the greatness of the manifestation of God and how it was revealed in such simplicity and such weakness and and our nature the way that we as humans look at it we don't like weakness we're afraid of it really it kind to brings out something about our nature and it shows us our inferiority z' and it displays something about us that we really don't want people to know and that is when we get apprehensive and we get afraid whenever we become weary of things and we tend to hide an element of our fears and an element of our weaknesses and we want to kind of put on a little bit of a front very few people probably ever really convey the depth of how they feel and yet the Lord Jesus knew that in order to be able to cover us as being a faithful high priest that would be touched by the feelings of our infirmities that he must go beyond the facade of what most humans would do even after they received the new birth he must go beyond what would ever be displayed by the strongest and by the weakest of Christians he must go to the very place that he would not only feel so vulnerable but he but also looks so vulnerable so we that God in his greatness would be able to express the greatest work that he had ever been able to accomplish we still marvel at the creation of the stars in the universe and the earth itself botany life animal life all the things that our Father has done but yet we know his greatest work was not achieved in any of that it speaks of his greatness truly but the greatest thing that was ever accomplished was in the weakness of the body of his own sonship that God would choose something that would be so powerless representing himself in such a weak way I like the way that brother Branham deals with and he says there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire and our life and that is we have to master the salt of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it all on our own our own intelligence our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use this now where where is brother branham getting that thought I don't believe that he just drew it out a space somewhere but I believe that he's drawing it from the very patterns of the Old Testament he's drawing it from the patterns of the four Gospels but more importantly he's drawing it from the very pattern of our God himself revealing himself in the form of sonship now whether or not you understand it the Lord Jesus must have allowed himself to feel this thought in his human journey on the earth he must have allowed himself to feel that there was a salt of human ability now in order for us to conquer this in order for it to be placed under our feet we must have a high priest that can relate to every prayer that we will ever pray so if we have to right Lord helped me to master the thought of human ability then our priests must have experienced that thought that feeling himself and understanding how that one would feel empowered by Almighty God but remember the difference was between him and us was that we only have a very very small portion but he had the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelling in him and it must have imparted to him as he's learning in this human contradiction it must have imparted into him and the human make up that he had strengths an ability that would make him tend to lean toward the human side he must feel what preachers will feel he must feel what his musicians will feel down through the church ages what song readers would feel and deacons would feel and even just everyday strong Christians that they would feel that they have an ability to accomplish what God wants for them in their lives and they feel that they're doing it and they're feel that as a why as a housewife they're doing a pretty good job and they're raising the kids and they're doing you know a very good job of that and I had around the house they keep the house clean and they're able to be a pretty good wife and they're able to be a pretty good mother and they get to the spot well you know what I think I'm doing really a pretty good job but actually God wants your sister to master that thought of human ability and if you look around in your life and you'll see sometimes your children but we'll begin to raise up and things will come in your house and you're wondering what in the world is going on Lord everything seemed to be going so good I wonder if it's not God letting you be tried to prove that you as a housewife don't have the ability on your own to hold it all together I wonder sometimes it's us brothers as the men of the hole if God will not allow things to come our way now even though we don't like it even though we all despise the things that we're going through and the change in our life and all this thing with this virus but yet we know our God still has it all control the devil may have pull things over on us but he ain't pulled it over on our God at all but I wonder if God will allow things to come our way that would so get it out of our norm that would get it out of our ability that we can control this and we can choose this and we can choose that that God would help us again to realize Lord we are helpless and hopeless without you in our life lord I may try to be a pretty good father I may try to be a pretty good husband and a pretty good grandfather and try to do it as best as I can as be a pastor but yet Lord there's things that come against us that we just have absolutely no control over and we confess it Lord God we need you to even live our everyday lives as their right brothers now think that if brother Branham would make such a profound statement that we must master the salt of human ability then I believe I'm sure you will agree with me as well that the message followers will contend was this great battle that he is setting forth for us now no doubt this had never been preached quite this way before men had preached on trials and tests and Spurgeon himself won the Great Prince of preachers and actually use this as a background for several sermons that he preached in Wickliffe and Luther and many different men but the battle had so progressed from the time that those men had lived and the time that better Brandon preaches since in 1961 now we sing how much harder is the battle today in 2020 than it was in 1961 when brother Branham preaches and if time goes on and men still are alive in preaching five years from now it'll be harder five years from now than what it is tonight so we know then as the words of God grow and the channel of God moves in the progression of life that God can take the exact same words and update the inspiration and that's why we can preach from a Bible that's 2,000 years old a New Testament so the notices he says where we think that we can have the intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us that's right notice he says we make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability now the Prophet is not talking about god-given talents he's not talking about god-given gifts he's talking about things that we inherited from our mother from our father from a mother's side from our father's side abilities or learned abilities education scholarships and so on and we take that as abilities and we try to tackle the job with our abilities instead of our god-given gifts notice this he says we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender and to come to God you've got to surrender to him both soul and body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and in me now listen I says this I know that's hard I know that's hard because I we're always wanting to put our part in I don't believe brother branham Buddha said this if it was not the truth so every one of us in weather or preacher song leader housewife factory worker pain or farmer whatever we are every one of us in our call of God want to put our part in to what God called us to do and whenever we do we go to mix in what God wants for us and what we think about it and we're only hindering him from being able to flow fully and our lives now he says something that we know you know that we want to do we said well I just know I just know it should be done this way but as long as you're doing it that way it's going to be wrong now there ain't no high flow well God will take high for his way and high fuel and well it ain't exactly what God wanted but that's ok I'll use it no if it ain't God's Way it's wrong there's only one way about it's God's Way or it's the wrong way but as long as you're doing it that way it's going to be wrong and God will never use that effort now think about it we could put for so much effort we could put for so much ability and Wicked's be sincere and we could do it was all of our hearts but if we've got that one little thing that's not exactly right and that is lacking a complete surrender then according to what the Prophet said God will never use that effort now I'm all out of the message folks don't like it whenever I read this next quote then when other ministers read it but I'm going to read it in a way because I believe you brothers believe the message and you saints that are streaming tonight so I believe you can take it I've often said the greatest enemy of God is the man that many message people otherwise I wonder how it would make God feel to know what the message people do to William branham's greatest enemy well hallelujah now the senators say what he said let's say what the tapes say I won't and say the greatest enemy I've got is William Branham praise the Lord he's the one that gets in God's Way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it I don't believe other brand was being humble brother Branham was being honest now this just go ahead and say the truths about it brother Branham was born as lost as all the rest of us has born lost brother Branham need to be saved brother man need the Holy Ghost rather than need to repent and brother Branham made some mistakes and lots of them now if you don't argue with me he himself said he made mistakes I'm only saying the other quotes that the rest of you folks that say don't make mistakes one quote you're telling a lie you're not saying all they say it now this man was a human this is the reason I can follow this kind of man I cannot follow the William Branham that is projected from headquarters because that William Branham is false he never lived that William Branham never existed the William Branham I'll follow had to repeat he had to get saved he had to get the Holy Ghost he had to go before God over and over again as a matter of fact the Holy Ghost called him a hypocrite because he lied well praise the Lord the Holy Ghost called him a hypocrite is that the truth the angel the Lord had to rebuke him because he got his fish and lion tangled up and said you an out there explaining something and you didn't even understand it yourself and you caused all these carnal impersonations brother Branham is the one who caused him according to what he said y'all can say Amen right that's what he said now this is the man William Branham that would get in God's Way so how did brother Branham going before the Lord Jesus whenever brother Branham would in God's Way how could brother branham go to a high priest that could not understand the humanity level that would get in God's way unless he allowed himself to feel the pull on his humanity and to try to make it get in God's Way now he never did Jesus never did we have no example where Jesus ever failed God we have no example the Lord Jesus ever lost his temper that he ever got upset well praise the Lord you'll find no example you'll find no scripture shall find no quotes that I've ever run across where Jesus ever lost his tempers you know really got upset and had to come back repent he never had to repent it was send us but he had to allow himself to feel that and then conquer it in order to know how you would feel when you wouldn't conquer it now as our high priest he must allow his humanity to feel the feeling of one that would succumb to it but if he would have made one mistake he could have never been our sacrifice if he one time would have ever raised his voice if he one time would have expressed human anger the way we do he would not have been a sinless land keep that before you in looking at this humanity of the Lord Jesus he never ever one time did one thing that was wrong but the great saying that he allowed himself to do was to be able to feel this upon himself so when brother Branham would go back to the Lord Lord I'm so sorry I got in the way Lord Jesus please forgive me then the high priest could recall his humanity on the earth and recall the feeling that would come against his own humanity he never crossed that line now but he allowed himself to feel that pull this is what he was feeling in the Garden of Gethsemane as Paul talked about in the book of Hebrews that he called on him who was able to save him from death and it was heard in that he feared so the Lord Jesus actually peered into the cut of his destiny and he a spirit God is there any other way that man's Redemption I was not trying to get away from redeeming his bride but he was simply looking for an easier way isn't that what we do because God's Way will always be just a little bit harder or maybe I should sit this way God's Way will always be a whole lot harder than our way because if we humanly could choose the way to get to heaven when mood straighten out all the curves in the road would have leveled out all the bumps would make it a whole lot easier along the way women have near as many trials and tests and so on but of course God don't do it that way and the Lord Jesus as he looked at it as a man he must allow himself to look at the cup and he said father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me I've said the same thing time and time again and so if you and I'm so glad with the Lord that whenever we do that we can go to our high priest and he's not going to draw out a flaming sword and just cut her head off but he knows exactly how we feel because he himself I got so disappointed with people he got so let down by people and so discouraged I imagined the Lord Jesus felt more discouragement than any human being that ever lived on the face of the earth he must have felt so downtrodden I'm so sad we think how sad we feel with things that happened in this life oh wait we don't know sadness we do not know sadness to the degree that he felt it and yet he allowed himself to feel this way so and we feel sad we could go to him and he would lift us up notice this better Bram said speaking about himself he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometime where he thinks he can do something about and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture now if you're not following this william branham you're following of false prophet you are following a man that has been made by message followers that never existed he is a prophet of your imagination this is the weird the real william branham well hallelujah well some folks just clicked off the internet did they well that's all right notice this notice he said that shoves God right out of the picture but one I can get rid of that guy what God William Branham so does that make them brother man's flesh and brother man's genealogy does that make them God's pics absolutely not our branham's more close to God than all the rest of us no did they have a special advantage not one it's a matter of fact are more responsible that's right because they lived around this man their mothers and their fathers and now their grandchildren but now think of it he said this God notice what he referred to himself as when I can get rid of that guy it's hard to me care for that oh boy too much well I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about friends we can see that in his life over and over again remember when they burned the baby in a brother branham astir pray for the baby and there supposed to be a hat laying over on the table but brother branham reaches over and grabs the baby and instead of the baby getting better at God worse and then he said Oh God forgive me Lord I'm so wrong what'd he do he jumped ahead of the vision come on now don't get quiet he jumped ahead of the vision and then he Lord if you'll forgive me that's the person that would you still got confidence yes but the random I do well the man walked in late the hat down then what everything was in the right place who got in God's Way it wasn't Gabriel who got in God's Way and what Michael it was the man William Branham who gets in God's way in my ministry it's the man Donny Reagan who gets and our wards way of his Minister it's the man Darrell Ward it gets a Louie's way who gets in his way who gets in your way those of you that are streaming at home it is you that's our greatest enemy and Satan will do everything he can to keep us from recognizing who our greatest enemy or you say it's the devil I'll tell you one thing hope you understand what I want to say in reality the devil is not your greatest enemy the devil cannot make you smoke he cannot make you drink he cannot make you pick up your phone and look at something you shouldn't look at you still got free moral agency you can still say no you can turn him down you are your greatest and when we can bring us under control that's when we'll see God do something praise be to God oma and God can come over and do things that Donny Reagan Darrell Ward Larry Elliot hey Raven knows nothing nothing knows nothing notice he didn't say knows 98% but knows nothing there's part of God's Way even its message we've been around it we still don't know we don't understand well hallelujah oh my then God can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about but my heart is gonna be scored set to this huh I feel it already then when that's when God can you ship that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we can get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot all right oh my god passes those who thinks there's something to take somebody that don't know nothing to order to work his purpose in their life that's what we get god said to Paul my strength is perfect in your weakness my strength becomes more perfect praise God this will make a lick of sense to the human mind to the human understanding my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker my strengths becomes more perfect I'll tell you one thing it must be really recent a good set of perfection around us ain't it whoa we're weaker and weaker and weaker miles I was having an office time it was just a third of us been able to come to church I talked about the JD on Sunday I said you know what we need to change this let's merge us in the true groups I think we can make it work I imagine the devil he'll his sides on Monday here's a life in the midde ha ha ha big boy now you're going back to 10 but hang tight devil we'll be back and we'll be stronger than we've ever been before all I'm saying is you better watch out Katy a better bar of the door because the sons of God's gonna rise back again amen that's right we will not be defeated we are undefeatable we absolutely will not go down but who knows what will come out of our hardships and our difficulties and our trials that says we get weaker and weaker the way the world looks at it that God's truth will be so strong inside of us I'll tell you how strong he wants it to be he wants it to be so strong in us that our bodies can't take it no more that's the power of God and it's God do one of these days it'll change us back to young people MA think of this God passes those who thinks there's something to take somebody that don't know nothing now there's a great difference and somebody that don't know nothing and somebody that's acting like they don't know nothing when really in their self they think they know a lot and they want to classify that is humility nothing you know I'm nothing I'm nobody hell right they don't believe that not only they notice this God passes those who thinks or something to take somebody that don't know nothing to order to work his purpose in their life that's what we get go said the poem my strength is perfect in your weakness my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker more you can yield to me the better I can you show the more you can forget about your education the more you can forget about your denomination the more you can forget about your stuff we've all got a lot of stuff this is the stuffier sage it's ever been on the earth we got some much stuff and stuff about this and stuff about that but the more you can forget about your stuff and you yourself to me the more I can use you because you become weak and I'll make my own purpose strong God can make strength out of weakness that's the reason he always does it now we take for instance like enable from Abel comes Seth and Seth's lineage come right down I'm down to Noah's time all of them were just humble farmers but Cain's children become smart shrewd educated great men builders professional men but God's side was weak and humble that's how God use them that's God's opportunity that's God's Way of getting to us is when were weak oh my we get something then this encourages of of course cuz God's whole kingdom is built out of these kind of people who would want this kind of people but God who would want a person like the woman at the well who would want a man like Peter who would want people like us nobody but God so i'ma go so so bad the devil wrote us off some of us is in such a bad shape Imam I even demons out of help others are very no hope for them at all but Jesus reputation is made among people like us people that are they all scouring of the world or so to be because we're able to come to a spot to realize the Lord we can't do it and we don't just say that when they first get say but the longer were saved and the farther we go on their journey the more we realize long I can't even walk without you holding my hand I don't even know how to pray lord I don't even know what chapter to read today on the Bible leave me Lord Jesus I don't know how to face the devil I don't know how to face this journey but Lord God I just present myself to you and I believe you'll give me strength o my notice it's the case with us not that we're too weak the case is we're too strong we're we're just too strong that's all the thing of it is we're too strong headed strong headed that's right we're too strongly ahead we know too much praise the Lord God wants to get that out of us now now we've been around for so many decades around the message of the hour now I know so much about the message when a preacher goes to court on a quote people can sit in the pews and tell them if it left out on Andrew the arrow dot dot and we can quote all that but do we have faith to make it live in our lives when all hell is coming against us and our babies broke out in a fever and they don't know how we're going to pay our bills so we go all the pieces or do they take that word that's in her head and believe that God will stand right there with us what is it it's a message education we are becoming more educated more educated and I realize every quote I put on the screen here from preaching I realize the danger side of that if I can say it that way is that it will enhance people's education as long as they let it go that way that quote will become Farm Show that's the reason I do it because an image and it has a power on you but we don't want it just to be an image that's imprinted in our mind that we can be able to quote it and send outside and debate back and forth but we want a hallelujah in the midst of trouble in the midst of trials when the Spirit of God brings that quote and pulls it right back in your memory and helps you to say devil get out of my way Satan in the name of Jesus I rebuke y'all for my child I rebuke you out of my body this is my Tabernacle in the name of Jesus leave it we don't want it just to be quotes we don't want to tell education we want it to be Rhema words from God and of course he's the only one that can do that notice this oh my said that's right we're too strong in our head we know too much God wants to get that out of us God want us to forget the quotes God want us to forget Scripture no but he wants us to forget our ability of how we know how I would through thinking we can use it Satan could quote that word MA he could quote that word like a theologian he is a theologian he cannot quote any preacher in this message but he can't live it notice this Moses realized it I love the way says this God took him in the back in the back in the wilderness to learn some human weaknesses oh my goodness why in the world would people need to learn human weakness well it's when you feel like you're so superior that you ain't got none he took him back to learn what it was all about so well did he learn oh my did he ever get a lesson God must have had a time of him you know Moses had a temper and he gave him the wife by the name of Sephora and she had one too so I imagined everything wasn't so pleasing on the backside of the desert for a while when both of their tempers got out of control at the same time well hallelujah I suppose his intellectual conception of how psychology ought to control a person didn't do much good don't do a whole lot of good in the day we're living in does it people take their uppers and their diners and this and that and the other but you don't want all Prince Moses got to thinking you know what I'm I believe I'm God's man I believe hallelujah I can just take care of this thing all God's got to do is just give me a go-ahead and I'll roll up my sleeves and just do whatever God needs to be done outer God said you need a wife oh Jesus I mean you need a wife beautiful Egyptian women God one of them women that'll just bow down to me that wasn't what I was thinking I was thinking of sapore support what in the world zip all in the world is that oh god is she was she gonna worship me and she gonna think on this great mighty Prince you'll see but she's the one you need oh my goodness now I've got to tread carefully right here since it's all men in this place tonight we don't want our sisters showing up your Saturday night marching out to our protesting or something but Amen it can happen both ways and help it God God can give a woman the kind of man that maybe it's not too sweet either but I'm just reading the quote now y'all just do whatever you wanted I'm just reading a quote notice he said I suppose his intellectual conception of how psychology ought to control a person didn't do much good because when he was on his road down to Egypt aussi Sapporo still had a she got the foreskin of her son off and throwed it before Moses and said you're a bloody husband to me God was so angry with him he looked for him in the end if he could have found him he would have slayed him I got some ones little sayings God had to teach him back there that he was a human can you imagine in your mind this man got to a spot he didn't think he was a human now I know it might be hard for Sammy able to come for him but believe it or not ideal was some that nearly think that idea was something to think there a God as a matter of fact I know someone who said not long back that they wish they could take God's place for a little while because they felt like they could Verde to run things but you see God was gonna say wait a minute I I made a mistake here about Moses I miscalculated how strong he was no God actually chose him on purpose and let him go that way and be educated and be strong and be a God so he could get married the marriage took care of his Scott ship brought him down to be a humble man that learned how to say yes ma'am well praise the Lord the stand brothers will all be dismissed oh ma notice he said God had to teach him mama some things that he was a human all of his wisdom of Egypt all of his powers of his intellectual God could not use or one of them now your nights and how much psychology and astrology all these things and Moses and Ernest have bought water deliver I'll be I'll tell you one thing Oh my about a week of the sapore who astrology didn't help nothing raiding the Stars he probably looked for opportunities to be out it not to read the stars oh god do I have to go back home oh god do I have to go back home God had to teach him some human weakness because Moses in his mind had got so elevated notice whenever you get licked and you realize you're licked then come on back and humble yourself get weak find out you're human so apparently there must be more cases of it on the earth there must be a whole lot more folks that don't think they're human ain't it they must think they're angels for theophanies or whatever more I'm so glad I know I'm just an ignoramus I'm so glad that I know I'm a human and there's none of your intellectuals can do it human weakness will never be used notices by God God by the human weaknesses pours himself into you I love this then he uses himself this is 5uq me heard me pray this for over 30 years God used this part of yourself that you put in my life use this part of yourself that you put in my life you see when preachers separate that and they think they're the guy they think they're the one they're the professional preacher we've got some in the message and that's what they are - there are professional preachers they ain't got no they don't need the anointing they don't need inspiration they can preach with them without it you can that's exactly right you can take my word for - brother Darrell he had wanted to tell him several years ago I can preach with the anointing or without it don't really even need it well I'll tell you one thing I need it every time I get up to preach I'm scared to death and once he comes I'm good oh my but until he does I'm an absolute nervous wreck can you imagine that God is we move out of the then God takes that part of himself this is what he was doing in the body of the Lord Jesus spirit God was taking that part of himself and using that this is the head of the new race this is the way the rest of the race will follow in that same example the eternal will use himself to live his own life out of week hallelujah we human beings that get up every day with difficulties and problems and surrounded by issues and in their mind they're trying to sort through it oh god help me how in the world can it be and God says let me have it I'll be with you today don't don't don't don't try to work it out yourself why don't you let me have it I'll give you my joy you give me your problems I'll give you my peace Alleluia I'll give you my peace you give me your issues I'll give you my comfort and my peace and the tribal trouble you give me all your problems and I'll work them out for you would be most foolish not to accept that rather oh I love this he said God by human weaknesses pours himself into you then he uses himself you just become an instrument certainly you got to get yourself out of the way now this is one of the reasons that our high priest had to become weak second Corinthians 13:4 for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of God for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of God towards him Hebrews chapter 5 verse 1 for every high priest now what's the parallel that Paul is gonna run to the Levitical order and the order of Christ which is the Melchizedek order for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God then you may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and then your brothers that I can see visibly know that we still can do some pretty ignorant foolish things I'm glad he don't just have compassion on the smart the intelligent and those who always make the right decision sometimes we make some of the dumbest decisions I'm so glad when we do that our God don't mark us off and write us off he please for our ignorance praise God it ain't always that you're ignorant about the correct formula baptism it isn't that you're ignorant about what is that dress the center in decent you should be able to know that but now but if sometimes when they do stupid stuff and we let the devil take advantage in our lives or we mess up in my we say the wrong thing or at the wrong time or whatever more and we caused this person a problem in that one and the NAPLAN and that what is it many times it's our ignorance and our stupidity well praise the Lord anyhow but notice who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity and it means to be affected moderately or in due measure to preserve moderation in the passions especially anger or grief hence of one who is not unduly disturbed by the errors and faults and sins of others but bears them gently notice how Paul said that when God chose a high priest he chose out from among the people so that man when he would walk in behind the veil that he would be able to walk in knowing I'll also need help and the high priest would walk in once one time of year behind the veil and unity offered the sacrifice first for himself he did not offer for the rest of the people even Atsuko and neither seven times in becoming out the very first time is for himself why because he also was a man he wasn't sending there I'm holier than you I don't need this but he offered it for himself oh my notice how the transition as it comes now to the Lord Jesus that even though he did not need a sacrifice he still wanted to enter into the place of the high priest he said Father let me understand my brothers let me understand their feelings and the weakness so I can have compassion I want to go so low that my humanity will pray to dodge the growth let me stoop so low that I will be cursed out of your sight I will be cursed out of your sight and go to hell so my brother's won't have to thank you Lord Jesus who can have compassion on the ignorant I don't mind telling you sometimes I struggle with ignorance sometimes I see people and they do things and you think lord have mercy you born yesterday you just back out of an egg somewhere why in the world would you do someone I'm just being honest and I'm the one that's got the microphone and all you sitting here and all of you out there don't like like you don't the same way sometimes we have a hard time of rendering compassion when people do stupid stuff they know that if I get into the Wafaa but the Lord Jesus needed to feel ignorance he was not inert but he needed to feel that come against him because he knew so many of his people even after the new birth would do so many ignorant things praise the Lord oh I know some of you want to act like you're super intellectual sinners you're just as stupid as the rest of us there's no high Christ sins and loke license that you seeing it's just sin notice who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way now this is a metaphor that Paul used here them that are out of the way it's borrowed from the terminology of the day of someone that is walking from Samaria to Jerusalem or Damascus to wherever more and they got out of the path they got out of the designated road and they had a map and they were told this is the way to live and you come up here go right that this tree certain trailer go by prayer live and they had instruction and they knew the right way to go but for whatever reason they became enticed or curiosity whatever was I actually left the beaten paths and they got out of the way and I high priest below he wanted to know how that felt how does it feel how are they feeling my sons my daughters will actually leave my declare paths I will declare it so well I will mark the path before them it will be so made known but I know them I know that there be times they will intentionally step out of paths so father let me feel I won't do it I don't leave the path but let me feel Nepal to leave hallelujah you imagine Paul goes on to say that this high priest would understand because he himself is compassed was in front of a team talked of headaches yes he understands it talks of weakness yes he understands it so he is compassed he has the same infirm nature inbred weakness and the Lord Jesus think of what he was he was the logos the very image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him all things were made and through him were all saints men he is before all things in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and it was him and yet he chose this path to move from the great omnipotence to understand ignoramus to pull the feeling of stupidity into his body and allow stupid thoughts to go straight mind praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah now this is why the high priests can walk in and it bears the ephod and he bears the bonnet and the rib and the blue and all these significant colors and stripes and so on but he's not walking in there feeling if it's a Trula days above his brethren and apart from his brethren because yes to offer a sacrifice first for himself then he turns and comes out changes clothes goes back in again turns comes out seven times so he's still feeling the fear of his own atonement but this man this man never had doll for a sacrifice for himself he never sinned never now I have an issue with those around the message who want to make Jesus so human that they make him a sinner by action I disagree with you on the basis of the scripture and the message of the hour that is contrary to the Word of God you're going back to the first century erroneous teaching that was brought not long after the deity that Godhead was revealed he never sinned never sinned he became sin he never sinned notice Paul said in verse three and by reason here he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for since I no man taketh this honor unto himself but he that is called of God as was Aaron I'll tell you this verse Fabri the darrell just overwhelms me so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a priest well I'll tell you one thing the folks around this message that have got the attitude bless God I'm a preacher I'm a singer I'm a guitar picker I'm this and that and the other thing y'all need to set out and hear me preach I'll tell you one thing you need to let me show you what a preacher can do and what a singer can do and our Lord Jesus our Lord Jesus never took glory to himself brother let me visit says it this way that the body of Jesus could not glory in the presence of God he said no flesh I know that he chokes you jesus only said that he said no flesh can glory in the presence of God not even the flesh of Jesus so jesus never said please don't call I've done I've done all this but he said he just remained silent they covered he did not assume okay now that I've done this don't that make me high priest now I ain't how the legal game player and I believe guitar player 99 number one only now that that's not the Spirit of Christ is there wasn't on him then it's not onlys people today those that want to be recognized and be this and be that now let me tell you something if you can't preach to one you don't got no business preaching to 500 a singer that to sing on Sunday morning only I've got a problem with them I don't mind telling you you should be one of the sing to two or three or four or five because if you're doing it not for a show you're doing it for the kingdom of God notice he said so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but he that said unto Him thou art my son today have I forgotten me you imagine the Lord Jesus after his resurrection never ask for this position if the eternal had not given it to him he would still to this day have never us to be that's the Spirit of Christ so those who have a dream and have a gift and have a tongue and have this and that and the other and they want to make themself a prophet and they want to make everybody in the church bow down to them I'll tell you right now that that spirit comes from the gates of hell that is not the Spirit of Christ we're talking about a risen Savior but he never assumed to say can I now be high priest can I now be high priests Jenna cannot can I can I can I can i Jenna Florida God he would not on himself assume this position of dignity of dignity praise be to God but if father wanted him to be high priest let father say it hey man the father wants me to be a preacher let father call me no mama no my daddy not opal whoever Moore and Grandpa so and so not my wife come on site hey they've a brother Donny wants me to be in the church to be their center will that brother Donny do it I don't want to push myself and push myself and make myself no that's why that God cannot use that type of attitude oh ma but it's so hard for us because we want to promote ourselves and push ourself and what is it that we're pushing it's not the Christ it's the humanity but notice the father said but he that said unto Him thou art my son he appointed him to this office to execute this office and anointed him with the oil of gladness above his fellows was an oath prescribed to him glory to God so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son today today so it started on a certain day you know what day that was that was the day God raised him from the dead his Melchizedek Priesthood hallelujah it did not begin whenever he was just laying hands on the sick hallelujah but he had to enter into the presence of God first that's right which could not take place till after he'd raised from the dead then after that oh my god said this day thou art my son ah begotten I have raised you from the dead I have crowned you with the priesthood of milk as the power of an endless life praise God let's stand together notice this in Hebrews chapter 5 verse 6 and you say us also on another place thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications were strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death so jesus actually prayed to be saved from death oh brother Darrell I'm so glad I'm so glad God didn't out of that prayer don't you see why I had to pray that he had to feel this how many times have I've tried tried God please please God I don't want to preach God please I get in trouble so much please God you know whenever as young I use the excuse that's too young now that I'm getting older and say God I ended up that retirement age and then even the Social Security do you know what is the next year something like that I could draw Social Security lower there mercy who ever thought I'd live that long Lord in about time for me to retire he life then he life's now so are you called laughing at me Wow because there's still something about the pain of the course there's something about the pain that we don't like oh I'm so glad he went this way in the days of his flesh notice the way that Paul separated this showing that he pre-existed before his pre incarnation this is his pre incarnated state who in the days of his flesh which many had days before his flesh well in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death wasn't it he was praying I don't want to do this Redemption thing I don't want to do that he wanted to do it but did he have to die this was the cup if you have to go that way father is there any way that this cup what was the cup the destiny the death that laid before can this Cup he didn't he didn't pray that the whole thing a beber move notice this most of us didn't want all of our burdens rolled away we don't want although our hardships wrote away but just the ones we handpick I don't kind of go through this or I don't care to go through that but God get out could this one be dodged because this will be I'm so glad he felt that brother down when I go before him say Lord please help me God I don't want being hated God I don't want being ridiculed and last hold on young you know how you do when you go before the Lord you can say I understand honey come here buddy we're buddies together I know I know you're not wanting to get away from me you're not wanting to turn your back or just parts of your cup that you wish you could pull this drag out and that one cuz it's it's hard I understand you're not mad every Lord how could happy mad at you well not felt the same an even greater I don't feel anger towards you this is what I feel compassion but lord I hate to trouble you I know you're so busy up there in heaven oh but your need takes precedent over the praise of agency when I see the grimace on your face when your bat moves or that that need that's out of joint or whatever more it still moves my heart Jam and my glorified body been living in this body for 2,000 years and this body is entered into the phase of eternal life but I see that grimace on your face I see as you move your arm it still moves me I love you I care for you praise God I remember the days of my humanity or let me say like this the days of my humility holiday I remember what it's like to live in a tabernacle of humiliation can we practically how can we ever thank you enough sir we could praise you from millions of years throughout the ceaseless ages we could never cover it Lord but all I know to do is do the best that we can till we get our new language and get our new body then we'll be more prepared I used to ponder of the statements that brother Branham would mention about eternity something about it taking eternity for you to reveal yourself and I just ponder and ponder over that I didn't question it Lord but I guess I just didn't understand it right but the more I see of you and how great you are the more I'm seeing it ain't no wonder the more we're hearing about you just in this life as mortals how much more is there to know about you and we've never even scratched the surface we're so grateful father that in our time of weakness stress anxiety trouble when we feel so weak that you come on the scene lift up our feeble hands praise God it was when Joshua was out there that night it seemed as if though the walls were so sick and so high the enemy was so great how would he ever be able to prevail the prophet of God had been taken from before him the element of the people were disgruntled complainers and we always had them but you sent down a man which was the captain of the Lord's host and Joshua's weakest time alleluiah the captain of the hosts came down glory to God in Peter's weakest moments when he had denied you cursed behaved awful and he felt like no doubt there's no need even trying to go back to serve him but you appeared to Mary and said go tell Peter and my disciples it was at his weakest time but in his weakest moment you called his neighbor oh Jesus I trust and have father to this little weak feeble sermon this little weak feeble count of Brethren that's sure tonight man you manifest your greatness through our weakness we don't have all of our musicians we don't have all of our Deacon brothers the library staff what we have used to hallelujah so Lord we just present our feeble effort I present this little weak puny service may you be able to take it Lord God and minister streets to your people and if there's anything good that comes out of it we know it'll have to be used it does it sure the great one among us we worship you tonight Lord Jesus oh how I love you I worship you my god help us to get out of the way Lord that you can use us we worship You Lord Jesus with all of our hearts thank you Father sing something for us hey can we just worship Him just a little bit before we let you go praise the Lord but brother Donny I feel so weak it's so weary I just don't know when I've been so low what it sounds like to me you're a candidate for a great move of the power of God in your life if you can just let go as the Prophet said we're not too weak most of us were too strong we'll always retain an element of our self-control because for some people there's that fear I've just totally letting go it's not us driving down a road and we're in the passenger seat a person on the driver's side has been there before but we feel so anxious and so nervous we'll put on the brakes and we'll jump and we'll jerk and whatever more why because we don't feel in control why is it that even flying in an airplane and if we dive and jump and drop and whatever more I never said more than them seats in my life but for a few minutes I think I'd feel more comfortable as I was up her and said that pilot was it wouldn't take me long to know that I've made a big mistake because there's something about us being out of control that's why backseat drivers and passenger seat drivers it's that nervousness it's them not been able to trust you that you're seeing the car coming and sometimes you may not but it's us letting go taking our foot off the gas our foot off the brake our foot off the steering wheel as it was and say Lord Jesus don't be my co-pilot but be the pilot of power off and don't always second-guess him don't be able to run the passengers hand Lord turn Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord worshipping praise it don't command it don't order don't tell them how to drive your life but spend your time and adoration and praise and worship and love [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Nord if you can
