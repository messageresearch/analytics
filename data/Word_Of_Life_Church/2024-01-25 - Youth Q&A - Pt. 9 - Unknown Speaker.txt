the praise the Lord let's get brother J hand for leading that for us praise the Lord so grateful that we could be gather together again tonight first of all before I start answering questions I want to apologize to you that it's been a little while before I've been able to u to do them we scheduled last Thursday as I mentioned it and uh couldn't do it and scheduled of course before and some of these questions I've had for a month maybe brother Rob some want you sent to me maybe six weeks so I appreciate you being patient with me um but but the ones I've got so far we'll probably be into the third year of the Millennium believe me I've got a bunch of them but I've enjoyed studying them and uh I think it's going to be a a blessing to you there's a young brother from our church here that had U several questions and um his mom and dad asked Carol and I if we would come over one night and eat supper with him and um help him with those questions and we did that and U I asked him if it would be all right if I would add those questions also to the U questions that we have I'll not tell you who it is and I told him that I wouldn't so um with what was turned into brother Rob and brother Joe and the ones that were also email to me uh plus those we've got a bunch but I've already enjoyed studing them and I just trust it'll be a blessing let's just pray together before we U look into these questions Lord Jesus we count it such an honor that we would be able to be gathered here tonight I look out upon this group of young people and my heart just jumps for Joy thinking Lord they could be out drinking running around partying doing all kinds of different things but they wanted to come to church again tonight and they were just here last night they had questions on their hearts and maybe some of them didn't ask the question but I just trust that as I answer the questions for those who did ask it there will be others that will be benefited and blessed by it not only in the visible audience but also those that'll go back in streaming I know the ones that we had before I heard from people all over the world that were so benefited and blessed by these questions we thank you Lord that we have people that desire to know what's right what's wrong how can I please the Lord how can I serve him better Lord Jesus you've told us blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled help us tonight help me Lord to get out of the way Lord God help me that I wouldn't say anything wrong help me that I would never ever Lord not just tonight but ever in my life ever say anything that would lead anyone astray it's my desire father to be a faithful and true Shepherd help me Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus and everybody said amen amen God bless you you can be seated thank the Lord certainly appreciate each of you for coming tonight would just remember me in prayer uh you know I I I so appreciate um brother brandham taking question and answers because he was actually the first preacher of all the preachers that I knew in Pentecost and the different churches that I've been into I'd never heard or seen of a preacher that actually did question and answers and I thought it was kind of tricky you know in one way doing question and answers and I've done them in different places around the world and believe me it can be tricky especially if you just walk up on the platform and they're laying there I don't like them that way I like to have scriptures and things to be able to um you know answer it well but what I so appreciate about uh the questions and answers that the prophet did was that the message itself him preaching is God using him to speak to us question answers are things that maybe the people didn't understand or something that brother brandham because of you know all the stuff that he was trying to cover it just left it out you know as well as I do no matter how long a man's been preaching how great of a speaker that he is he's not going to be able to answer every question sometimes you'll preach a sermon and you'll leave spots out you don't intend to but you just can't cover it all so sometimes the questions will help be able to clarify something and for myself I've got so many things even dealings with doctrines out of the question and answers that just clarifies it so much and part of these are are going to be um in the same way as we go to looking at them but the first one that I I mentioned to you last night that I wanted to uh deal with tonight which is why that I spoke in the direction that I did and the question is how do I know that I have the Holy Ghost now truly that's one of the greatest questions that all of us can have at that St stage in our spiritual walk with God after that is settled for an individual then it won't have as much significance as it did before they got the assurance and we believe that this message not only comes to uh restore our faith back to the original fathers but it comes to give us an assurance to where we can have a confidence down inside of us because after all if we come to church if we sing if we do all kinds of things we play music we're kind to people and we do lots of good things like that good deeds and we still miss the Holy Ghost what good has it done us so if you went to church every day of our life so to be able to know and be sure that we have the Holy Ghost that is a very great thing and it's not just showing people that have those questions I have to answer that many times in my office dealing with h maybe some of your fathers and mothers even some of your grandfathers and grandmothers and I've been asked that question around the world because it's something that people want to know and to make sure because in reality with your walk before God what is the greatest and foremost question that you'd be able to have to know that you have in your heart that ticket as it was that you are going in the Rapture is there any greater thing is there any greater question that can be asked once you have that Assurance even in time you will still wonder I hear preachers preach sermons and as long as I believe I've had the Holy Ghost I still will say Lord I just want to make sure I want to make sure everything is okay Lord maybe I just need a refilling any of y'all ever done that because you just feel like you just want to make sure that everything is all right between you and God now I didn't get to this uh last night because I run out of time but there's a lot of things that the Holy Ghost is um St John 14:16 Jesus said I'll pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive so this verse within itself proves to us that a sinner coming out of one of these chairs here coming up to give his heart to God cannot receive the Holy Ghost and you know according to what many denominational people believe that whenever you get forgiveness of your sins you get it all in one lump sum not according to Jesus you can't a sinner cannot receive receive the Holy Ghost the comforter he can forg receive forgiveness of his sins and receive pardon but this is another stage and Jesus calls this in verse 17 the spirit of truth I want you to keep that in mind because there's a spirit of Truth and a spirit of error and we don't just want the truth we want the spirit of truth that goes with it because the truth can be attained by anybody that would just simply take the Bible or take a message book or take a message tape and they say well I I've got the truth but if you don't have the spirit of Truth you won't be able to stay in that truth and it's the same way with error and the spirit of error probably every one of us here tonight are believing things that are wrong we just don't know it yet but if the word shows us something tonight and speaks to us and we'll say oh my goodness I didn't realize I I was believing that wrong Lord I am so sorry well that didn't mean you had the Spirit of error that just mean it hadn't been shown to you but people who have the spirit of error when you show them the truth they still will not accept the truth so it's not that they're looking at error at face value and truths at face value but what's behind it is a spirit which is motivating them and believe me in all my years of minist I've de dealt with many people that are in the spirit of error you can send them page after page of scriptures and quotes and they will not even acknowledge them to be the truth I did that not long ago to a message preacher I sent him page after page after page after page of scriptures and quotes he never even acknowledged them to be the truth so I realized I thought well maybe the man is just an heor you know and what he's doing his standing on this certain certain subject and all that I thought maybe he's just he don't know any better so I thought well I I figured the best thing to do is send him the truth and see what his reaction is now anybody with the Holy Ghost will always acknowledge the word to be right and themsel to be wrong now remember we're answering this question how do I know I have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will never in us will never put our feelings our opinion or mama or daddy or anyone else above the word of God and the young people said amen because why the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Truth and we've all had to come to that spot I know that will continue to do so and this is why we know we do have the Holy Ghost is because the spirit in us will always say Amen to the word and it'll say forgive me Lord forgive me Lord I'm sorry but if we have the truths at face value but in our hearts we have the spirit of error then we will take reasoning we will take well yeah yeah but but you know you know well you know you know how it is you know well see that person is motivated by the spirit of error now another thing I always go by and uh this is just a little preacher Insight whenever I'm dealing with somebody and um I give them something in the word and uh they always come back I give them something else they always come back with something else I give them something they always come back and I realize by knowing that individual that they're really not that smart and I know that they really don't understand the word that well to be able to produce that type of argument I realize I'm dealing with a person under the influence of a demon and that demon is actually anointing them and giving them the thoughts in their mind because they're under the spirit of error now if they were just believing error and they had a sincere heart and they wanted to be true and right before God then they would acknowledge hey brother I had seen that before thank you so much for sending me that oh pray for me pray for me that's a person with a sincere heart and a person also that has the spirit of Truth on them a person that wants to be right and they want to be able to be corrected so the truth can correct him so notice what Jesus said even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him now watch this excerpt into the godhead because you you you'll never be able to really receive the Holy Ghost and be able to see your position of who you are until the Myster of the godhead becomes more open to you now why didn't Jesus just come right out and say it it's not written that way it's written for the initiated those that are baptized into the kingdom of God to be able to understand it notice what he says he said the world cannot receive it because it seeth in not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you you who's he talking about well he's talking about himself in another form in another form so as I said last night it's the part of God that can be divided how he has God in your heart tonight you have him in one form or another justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost well there's no way in the world we have the body of Jesus and our and our human body of course but it is that portion of the spirit of God so Jesus as the humanity of God did not come back on the day of Pentecost but he come back in the form of the Son of God which is holy spirit which could be divided again in St John 15:26 but when the comforters come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth Now notice what the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me St John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth Jesus just keeps saying it over and over again that one thing that the Holy Ghost is he's an advocate he's a paracletos one called alongside to help us to act as your lawyer he is a rest he is a comforter He Is A Healer he's our righteousness but he is the spirit of truth and you know it's one thing that I've found about real genuine Christians around the message no matter how long they've been around how many tapes they've listened to and how many years that they've been in the message they always have a teachable spirit a spirit to where that they they come to the house of God and they don't come with a know-it-all attitude there's one particular man that I know that lives up up in Indiana and uh lives lives around the Tabernacle area there and he was talking to a friend of mine several years ago and I was going up there to preach and he said why don't you come and hear this brother yeah yeah he said that brother I'll tell you what he'll just be a blessing to you and this man didn't believe in going to church of course he didn't believe in Preachers and he said I want you to hand me my Hebrews book I want you to hand me my seals book so his wife hands him his book he said I want you to tell me any preacher that can tell me anything in this book that I don't know well the truth of it was he didn't know Hardy nothing in at all why that attitude you see he didn't have the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Truth you imagine brother brandham said every time he would open his Bible and read from his Bible he would find something in there that he hadn't read before you imagine him whenever he's preaching the seals and he said I would have made a horrible mistake today because you know what he was fixing to do he was fixing to call that white horse rider what he had called him for years the Lord Jesus brother brandom for years and years whenever he'd read that from The Book of Revelation whenever John saw that white horse rider come conquering and to conquer and he called that white horse rider the Lord Jesus you imagine how he must have felt brother Rob that day when the angel of God come into his room and said you've been wrong all these years well if he gets up and says that says that isn't that going to be embarrassing now aren't people going to take that tape where he preached Mighty conquer in 57 Mighty conquer in 58 Mighty conquer again in 60 aren't they going to take that and compare it now look you said here and you said there and now you're saying you're wrong but you see he had the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost could be able to say you're wrong and he would be able to stand up and say I was wrong how many can do that here tonight okay I'm stopping right now I'm making an aler call you see the spirit of Truth in every one of us knows that we've always got more room to grow do you brother Donnie are you kidding me the more I study and the more I look into this word the more I realize how much I don't know not how much I do what I brought to you there last night about the angels of God and them opening up and peering into that realm I was sitting that when I was up in Virginia there in a hotel last week I just about exploded all over that hotel room I thought how many times have I read that in the Bible you see as long as we have the Holy Ghost in us then there's an Avenue which is constantly open this is why Jesus uses these words of course how be it when either Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so notice what the Holy Ghost is doing constantly updating where you are now he's not just going to show you things that have been but things that are to be so as the spirit of God will speak through the ministers in this day get ready for this get ready for that pray you know trim your lamps all that a child of God with the Holy Ghost they hear that they say yes Lord Jesus I want to with all of my heart why they have the spirit of Truth in them and that spirit in them when they hear a man of God preach that they say that's the truth that's nothing but the truth I need to tighten up the armor a little bit I need to to pray more I need to read my Bible I need to do this and this and this why the spirit of Truth in them says Amen to what they're hearing preached notice in 1 John 3: 14 John gives us another little insight and to how that we know when we passed from Death un life we know that we have passed from Death un life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother Abid Us in death now is there one evidence now of course me coming from the Pentecostal background and I was taught for many many years and actually preached it that way that speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost and that's why the Pentecostals would so emphasize it even though I could not explain how some of those people that spoke in tongues and shouted and run and danced and jumped and everything else and yet 6 months they'd be backslid drinking smoking running around I had no explanation for that how could God ever seal them and yet they been able to do such a thing but whenever you look and see for us it's it's a little bit more complicated because they say well if it was just one evidence what if I just if I you know if I shake my head a certain way everybody that shakes your head like this has got the Holy Ghost well you think the devil can't do that too sure he could so it's a multiplicity of many things that the spirit of God will do out of our lives that includes love that includes the fruits of the spirit that includes obedience to words that you don't even know yet but when the spirit of God will bring it to you the holy spirit in you will Quicken your life to match that word but John says we know then that we passed now it's not I'm I'm hoping well I I'm really hoping that that I have no no we can absolutely know that we have passed from death into life and then John remembered that the Apostle of love and he said how be it or rather we know that we have passed from Death unto life because we love the Brethren now that remember that's not just from our mouth but that's indeed also and again 1 John 4:6 we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is notice not of God here is not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error so there were already people in this first church age and actually some of them were preachers and they were already preaching things that was contrary to the word and John identifies them drop Fe of course is mentioned here in this this Epistle of John Dr was a rich businessman and he John said that he writes about him calls his name and said that we we would have come to him but does wouldn't let us now you imagine how in the world would them people them saints of God ever allowed a businessman to keep an apostle like John from coming to the church and preaching I've never understood that to save my life you think that have had a revolt and said doct tropies sit down and shut up who do you think you are you're going to keep the great Apostle John and by this time he's the only Apostle left all the rest of them are done dead but this man had such a hold on the congregation that he had more persuasion than what the Apostle John did so he s John again identifies and says listen you want to know if you've got the spirit of truth if you've got the spirit of Truth you will hear us and if you've got the spirit of error you won't pretty good identification is it not well we go on the same way then and say in this day if God has sent us a prophet and if people have the spirit of Truth they will hear what he's got to say if they have the spirit of error they won't now watch brother random of course deals with it in many different sermons and I'm sure many of you have read or listen to the tapes but in broken sisters he says in St John 14 Jesus said when the Holy Ghost has come upon you he will reveal these things to you that I've taught you and show you things to come there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost he has never told me anything wrong yet now notice how he explains this it is the evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it cuz Jesus never said when the Holy Ghost has come you'll speak with tongues he never said the Holy Ghost come you do any of those things but he said he will take these things of mine and show them to you and will show you things that is to come there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost According To Jesus himself so all these Sensations and things that people have and still live on now we believe in Emotion don't we we believe the presence of God can come my goodness I'll tell you it was here so great last night I staggered under the presence of God my fingers started going numb the anointing coming out of me as I was ministering to the people of God yeah does it come with feelings yes does it come with emotions it does but them emotions ain't God all kinds of people have emotions you ever get scared somebody just stand out from a corner and say Bo and it just scare you you ever had cold chills to run up your spine does that mean there a holy ghost chill no it was your fear you were traumatized and you feel like smacking them in the face but does it come with that yes but that's not the Holy Ghost itself notice in question answer 64 there's one evidence of the holy spirit that I know of and that is a genuine facei now remember there can be a make believe Faith that's what Judas had Judas healed the sick preached cast out Devils he was in the 70 that was sent out in Matthew 10 we don't know who his buddy was but there was somebody went with Judas and Judas was not the type of preacher that had no Sons he had signs following his ministry so he would cast out devils lay hands on the sick and then recover no doubt Judas was a mighty preacher Prophet tells us in the church age book his ministry was not inferior to any of the rest Apostles and you've heard me preach it many of you since you was a young young children but Judas was not the type of guy that was all the time flirting with the women and he was all the time sneaking around drinking or as would say smoking and everybody knew man that guy you know oh I ain't got no confidence in him but when Jesus sat at the communion table and said one of you is going to betray me they questioned thems before they questioned him now you know if this guy was obvious everybody would say Jesus said one he was going to betray me that said Judas Judas Judas Judas Judas Judas Judas Judas everybody would have known who it was but he was so close to them they didn't even know it as a matter of fact they never set the way we do and eat but they laid reclined on a Dean as it's called so they would have laid kind of sideways John was laying on one side of Jesus Judas was laying on the other whenever the apostles would have walked in and the Lord Jesus would have told them where to set and they looked to see where Judas was the way they would have looked at the rightand position they would have had it in their mind Judas is the next leader little did they know he was the betrayer but looking at signs just like the rest of them wonders just like the rest of them Miracles just like the rest of them that's why we cannot go by signs alone right now we believe in signs thank God God performed some here last night God did some great things right here among us but that within itself is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost now notice he says it is a genuine faith in the promised word of the hour so it's not enough just to preach Noah's message it's not enough to preach the law it's not enough just to preach about the day of Pentecost but we've got to have the message of this hour now those Jews come and they had more religion than the disciples had they were better trained men in the scriptures than the disciples were because they were fishermen tax collectors and so forth they had real faith and genuine faith in what they were doing now listen how close those men were these men these scribes Pharisees theen Sadducees all they were they had genuine faith not a make believe Faith a genuine faith and what they were doing and they were as sincere as they could be but the word of the hour made flesh they said this man's a be so it wasn't that you could ever condemn them on the law they knew that law so well my my they knew that law and they believed that law but it was the word of the hour that proved who they were just like it'll prove us notice this who do you say this is evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing his word always been in every age if you can receive the word those priests had Jesus beat a million miles when it come to fruits of the spirit now you imagine they were so kind and so loving and so gentle boy that's a kind of preacher love that's what the Le c age loved on it they want to go just say how's everybody doing tonight now Little Darlings y'all are just so sweet every one of you is just as perfect as you can be why Jesus knows you can't live right well how many y'all sin today well that's all right honey I have to you know you drunk a little bit well I have two that's the kind of preacher they want youall don't want that kind do you brother Andrew Spencer was telling me the other day of a of a guy that they was talking about or the guy that had told them and said yeah I said I reckon we're going to have to get rid of our our pastor he said oh really he said yeah yeah Baptist Church said yeah we're going to have to get going to have to get rid of it said well what's in the world's going on he said he said every social event that we have whether it's a baby shower or a wedding shower whatever it is he's getting wor every time he comes he shows up drunk can you imagine a pastor showing up drunk is that what religion has come to is that what it's come to that the preachers oh God help us and yet they would ridicule us well don't sit there look at me funny I may not show up drunk but I do leave drunk sometimes I'm hoping some of you all do as well but drunk on the Holy Ghost is that right but notice when it would come to being Meek and nice and oh so gentle and just you know Jesus a sort of a rough kind of guy you imagine John the Baptist being the pastor of Word of Life Church oh John come out of that door over there with camel hair on him had a little bit of Honey on his on his mouth where he hadn't used his napkin wasn't a very clean sort of a guy ate Locust for supper and Wild Honey come out of there like a blazing fire and said bring forth fruits for repentance you got to repent get right with God y'all think I'm hard I'm like a Boy Scout compared to John the Baptist and then you imagine them other guys oh children come come to pap oh you went over and heard that old rough guy didn't you yeah I did he hurt my feeling so bad oh come here honey come here then Jesus comes out on the scene he said you generation of snakes oh my goodness St John 8:44 you are of your father the devil and you know who he was saying that to preachers wow so you imagine the next Sunday they'd get a well children I know how y'all feel cuz I went to one of them meetings too and he called me a snake well how could that be a man of God that ain't love they didn't know love did they they didn't know love now notice Jesus he said when it come to fruits of the spirit gentle peaceful Meek lowly he tore up churches kicked them over tore the people out called them Snakes in the Grass but he was that word he was that word that's it believe God God is the word so what is then the evidence how can you know how can I know that I have the Holy Ghost I will say Amen to every word now it's easy for us to say Amen oh I believe every word well what you should say is I can say Amen to every word that I know but no doubt there's a lot of them you ain't heard yet now maybe you've complied to everything that you've heard but there might be a sermon Sunday or maybe even here tonight you know in this question answers that you'll hear something oh my goodness it'll rub you so raw and it'll just man I didn't know the Bible said that I didn't know the prophet said that oh my boy that really gets right down where I live what am I going to do well if you've got the Holy Ghost you'll line up and you'll say thank you Lord for sending me the truth now that don't mean that it won't be a battle for you it will be a battle but with what this right here but the Holy Ghost in you the spirit of truth will want to bring your body subject to the word is that right notice again this day this scripture is fulfilled the Holy Ghost is the word of God in you that identifies Itself by accepting the word so the Holy Ghost then is the word of God in you so then how could the Holy Ghost in you read something out of the Bible or the message of the hour and say I just don't believe that well I I I just don't take that we don't believe that at our church well we only take what the prophet say when it's thus sayeth the Lord well I that was before the seals so is the whole new testament you're going to throw that away but notice the Holy Ghost is the word of God in you that identifies Itself by accepting the word outside of that it can't be the Holy Ghost if it says it's the Holy Spirit and denies how many one word of that Bible it cannot be the Holy Spirit that's the evidence whether you believe or not thinking man's filter now if you've got the evidence of the Holy Ghost a holy man or a holy woman's taste they want to live they've got eternal life because this word is quickened to them now here he's preaching on the thinking man's filter and he's going back to the desire inside of our soul but brother Donnie will I make mistakes you sure will will I fall short of the glory of God you sure will does that mean that don't have the Holy ghost it sure don't what now wait a minute Brother D once I get the Holy Ghost my mistakes are over auny who told you that lie I said who told you that lie cuz that's what that is your body ain't got the Holy Ghost and ain't never going to get it that's why this whole stinking thing's got to be changed private interview sister Georgie Bruce sister Bruce says I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times brother Brandon now responding that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lauded to you see he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him sister Bruce says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him your mistakes are not lotted to you he's your perpetuation he's your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him now listen at her sister Bruce says but I've never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I notice what she says that I could put my foot on now listen to his answer all right notice ordinarily a human being is born in sin shap and iniquity come the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being Sister Bruce says yes that was your nature it changed once but what changed it she responds Christ there you are sister he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me out eternal life and shall not come into the Judgment but has past tense passed from death into life St John 5:24 Jesus speaking you're a Christian sister Bruce I've watched your life I've watched you under vision and I know you are a Christian but as far as the way sister Bruce is looking at it apparently she's not not had the type of experience that maybe she was taught maybe she had a Pentecostal background we really don't know but somehow something had never happened to her that she was thinking should happen so she's fighting this battle that I don't have the Holy Ghost I couldn't have the Holy Ghost because whatever it is she thought was going to happen has never happened to me and yet the prophet said I have watched your life I don't mind telling you if I'd have been sitting there I'd asked them where they wanted a new door you imagine God's Prophet looking at your life and say I have watched your life you are a Christian I'd rather him tell me that than I was a preacher or I was a shouter or I was a guitar player you imagine your life being watched by Vision praise God he says I know you're a Christian see I'm your Shepherd as it was Sister Bruce says yes somebody to help if there was any doubt in my mind if I thought there was something wrong with you I'd tell you sister Bruce I believe that but if there's anything wrong in your experience anything between you and God as far as I know anything about it sister Bruce there's not a thing there's not a sing praise God so you mean act a person can genuinely receive the Holy Ghost they can still have questions in their mind whether or not they've got him yeah it all depends on what they're looking at and how they're saying okay now a person with the Holy Ghost will do this and this and this and this and this first of all make sure the requirement that you're setting is a scriptural requirement because if Satan cannot convince you one way he'll try to convince you another if he wants to convince you that you do have the Holy Ghost when you don't he will lower the standard and bring it down to your level if you do have it and he wants to convince you that you don't he will raise the standard so high that absolutely nobody including your Pastor has got it so what you want to have your standard is God's word and the young people said amen was that clear question number two when someone speaks in tongues and an interpretation is given how are we to know if the person is truly speaking with tongues and how are we to know if a true interpretation is given now that's a good question it's a tricky question not the person I'm not saying the person was trying to say it tricky now but it was it's it's a very good question let's read in First Corinthians 12:10 let's look a little bit about tongues to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues diverse kind kinds of tongues so for some they're given the ability by the spirit of God to be able to speak in different types of languages unlearned languages now and there are tongues of men and there are tongues of angels some some people would be gifted to be able to speak in tongues of angels and also tongues of men to another the interpretation of tongues so notice then it's a separate gift in verse 28 God has set some in the church first apostles second early prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing not one gift of healing but Gifts of healings helps government diversities of tongues again verse 30 have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret and of course we know the answers to this three-part question is no no no 1 Corinthians 14:5 I would that you all spake with tongues now I realize there's a lot of message people that don't like this verse but I wonder what Spirit it would be on us that would not like this verse this is just so much the Bible as acts 238 right this is your Bible right I would that you all spake with tongues but notice now but rather that ye prophesied now why because it's a difference in edification a person who speaks in tongu T and what they're speaking is not to be interpreted they are edifying themselves so you're alone in your closet at home you might even come up to the altar here for prayer and you might stand there and speak in tongues and and you're being edified because those of you that's ever done it you know it is quite an edification to yourself it's just hard to imagine if you've never experienced it what what what comes with it but prophecy is is not edification to the one speaking but rather prophecy is an edification to the body Now watch how Paul says this greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying verse six now Brethren if I come unto you speaking in tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine now remember we're talking about a church service here so if a person is at home and they're praying they enter into their prayer closet I love the way Paul says it there also that whenever we're praying and we don't know exactly what to say that the spirit can make intercept for us with Words which cannot be said and that word there is articulated so it's words that you yourself don't know I know people would life at us for saying we believe in speaking in tongues because in one way it doesn't make any sense because you are speaking a language that you yourself do not know now I hope hope you don't think I'm weird and crazy tonight but actually the spirit of God is anointing you and it is bypassing your brain it's not running those words through your brain because your brain does not know those words it has not been established in your memory the way English has so the spirit of God is tapping straight into you and using your mouth and you are saying things you don't even know what it is you you don't know the pronunciation you don't even know the meaning you know nothing about it and the spirit of God is using you to do that you remember the story brother random talking about being in the hotel room and he said Billy had come to get him and his before service and he said he was down praying and he heard somebody speaking in a foreign language and he said he thought man listen at that guy and he said he thought it was German or something he didn't know exactly what it was and it was going so fast but it was like it was outside the door of the hotel room where he was and he said what is that guy doing and he said then he realized it was him he was the one speaking well after it happened and the spirit of God he just spoke in tongues and spoke in tongues for High V long and then Billy come back knocking on the door brother R said he jumped up and got ready why he said he felt like he could leap through a tro and you know jump over a wall it's just hard to explain if you've never experienced it what it does to you come to find out there was a woman on the way to the meeting and a 35 chevet if my memory Serge me rer one thinking about remembering this quote but she was on the way to the meeting or husband maybe and someone else had brought her and she was hemorrhaging bleeding she started bleeding to death in the back city of this car so they pulled the car up on the side of the road got the woman out on the side of the road and she was laying there dying and brother BR said what happened was the angel of the Lord come into the hotel room and begin to ENT seed through brother Brandon praying but he didn't even know what was going on so it was the angel of God now wonder why that angel didn't do it himself they are ministers not so much oh Hallelujah intercessors but we are so this woman needed a miracle and the angel of God knew the state that woman woman was in and here he found a servant down praying and the angel of God comes in this hotel room and begins to anoint brother brandom and he's speaking in language that he never learned before and the angel of God was interceding through his lips and brother Brandon was acting out the part of a priest and praying in another language and when he went to church that night that woman jumped up started testifying and said what time was that what time did it happen and they timed it it was exactly the same time that happened in the hotel room so the spirit of God started using this now remember them tongues was not to be interpreted does everybody that speaks in tongues mean that it's the Lord of course not does it mean that everybody that speaks in tongues will speak a fluent language it does not as a matter of fact they may not say any more than one word like this seek them seek them seek them y'all ever heard brother Brandon refer to that okay I'll read it to you in a moment now Paul says now Brethren I come to you speaking with the tongues watch that I Prophet you except by Revelation or doctrine or prophesying notice in verse 18 I thank my God I speak with tongues more more than you all now I wonder how many message preachers would make Paul a Pentecostal what do we think we're more spiritual than him notice in verse 19 yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice I might teach others than 10,000 words in an unknown tongue wow how could that even equate five words with understanding would mean more to you as a body than if I stood here tonight and the spirit of God moved on me and I started speaking in tongues and I spoke 10,000 words by the spirit of God anointing me to do it and y'all would sit there and sat there praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord wasn't that wonderful wasn't that wonderful what' he say I don't have a clue any y'all know what he said you come to me brother Donnie you know what you said I don't so we just leave and say wow wow wasn't that something but you see five words with understanding has more value than 10,000 even supernaturally spoken in tongues you understand notice in verse 23 if therefore the whole church be come together in one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say you are mad which is crazy now remember he's not saying it's not the spirit of God so say every one of us would come in Sunday morning everybody in your starts speaking in tongues and we have visitors and that thing what in the world Brother Louis would get up to start leading to sing it he couldn't even even lead the singing for speaking in tongues brother Harry would go to helping him he couldn't even sing for speaking in tongues then one of your sisters would get up for a special and you get up and there you go in tongues the next person speaking in tongues Brother Lou said brother Donnie here he go speaking in tongues and I walk out I speak in tongues for an hour then we have somebody to close in prayer they close in prayer speaking in tongues and there's visitors sitting here and they're going to say that church is absolute nuts I've never heard such in my life you want to know one reason why Pentecost made such a name for themsel because of such stuff as that and they blamed it on God don't blame Babylon on God God is not the author of confusion and that's what that is now notice watch how Paul differentiates between speaking in tongues and he said will they not say that you're all mad but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all and judged of all now wait a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so if a person comes in and then you stand up and prophesy and you and you and you and you and you and then people that don't even believe in that and they're going to say my goodness my goodness God's in that place just by prophesying okay so apparently prophecy then is going to say something that's going to reveal something about that individual you see there's a lot of things that are said and done that are classified as prophecy that are not prophecy at all because it reveals nothing now listen what prophecy will do verse 25 thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest now speaking in tongues won't do that but if brother Jonathan speaks in tongues and and brother Paul would stand up and and interpret those tongues and it would be prophecy then it could go back in a person's life and say you stole so and so you done so and so you to the doctor yesterday then the doctor said you've got cancer if you don't make that right with God you're going to die that's true tongues and interpretation true tongues and interpretation does not listen carefully stand up and just repeat scripture it does not say over and over and over again the Lord is coming the Lord is coming now sit there and question me all you want to but I've got them quotes land right in front of me I want to give them to you now watch in verse 27 let any man speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by two or at the most three and that by course and let one interpret verse 28 but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and everybody said now remember the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet so we judge our emotions we would even judge if tongues would come upon you and you would feel it so strong and yet you cannot interpret and there's not interpreter in the church you will judge that feeling and that anointing that's on you and say according to the word of God I'm not supposed to interrupt this service and I'm not supposed to speak in tongues unless there is an interpreter but you see what happened in Pentecost was that they said well I'm going to obey the Lord the anointing is here and I'm going to do it I know the word says that but I'm going to do it anyway a then you see we open the first doorway for a demon Spirit maybe I'll read it to you before we're done with this brother Bram tells us in question answers 1961 about all tongues not being from God and he says a person could be baptized into the devil's power and speak in tongues and prophesy wow wow baptized into the devil's power now let me read the question again when someone speaks in tongues and interpretation is given how are we to know the person is truly speaking in tongues now watch's this God being misunderstood he says now someone speaking in tongues and another gets up to interpret the tongues listen close this is being taped and interpretation of tongues now I'm going to have to get down to some Doctrine in this and the interpretation of tongues many people interpretate tongues interpret tongues rather by an extraordinary expression of them feeling to say such a thing that is not interpretation now I'm a weird message preacher okay I'm strange I believe brother Brenham not only came to correct us on water baptism on Holiness on Election predestination I believe he come to correct us on gifts now I am weird in that sense because there's some message brothers that don't think brother Brenham had a very good understanding on the gifts so they revert back to 1906 use of the gifts but I'm not going to be judged by 1906 I'm going to be judged by this word right here here that we have now listen how he says this so an interpretation of tongues many people interpret tongues by an extraordinary listen to these words now remember this is a a a man with a seventh grade education listen to his terminology an extraordinary expression of them feeling feeling to say such a thing that is not interpretation now let's let a prophet tell us what interpretation really is interpretation is when they are speaking in an unknown tongue you are hearing them in English wow so I wonder how many true interpreters there really are so every person then that claims to have the gift of interpretation of tongues if they do not hear that language in English they are not an interpreter they are feeling an extraordinary something that is not interpretation man this is good ain't it it ain't notice now as I said I I'm one of them weird message preachers that I believe that we needed the 1906 trash that messed up the gifts clean out and would have the real gifts I would really myself like to see the real gifts cuz to be honest with you I'm not sure how many real ones I ever have seen well praise the Lord y'all ain't only just going to be quiet on me I'm I'm going to be deep fried after this tonight now notice he said I'm your father in The Gospel you don't want now listen you don't want a wrong Spirit you mean the devil would try to come in and convince people that they're using a gift of the spirit when it's actually an evil spirit how we going to know brother Donnie we'll judge it by the word of the hour now why take a substitute when there's a whole Pentecostal Skies full of the real why eat in a garbage can when there's a fine big clean table set there with chicken and dumplings now I want you to notice he's comparing a false gift eating out of a garbage can to a true gift eating chicken and dumpings now if you don't like chicken and dump dpls of course this quote don't mean nothing to you but for those of us people who like chicken and dumplings man we're smacking our lips so why would we want a wrong Spirit but people get in their mind oh if we teach that if we teach that it'll bind the spirit if teaching this word of God will bind the spirit I'll tell you one thing it's the wrong Spirit if we do what he taught my goodness why in the world would we study hundreds and hundreds of quotes to prove we need the gift and preach hundreds and hundreds of quotes to prove we got a right to a Pentecostal experience and then not go right back to the same message and prove how we're supposed to use them it don't make a lick of sense to me can I go on a few more minutes now watch here's an interpreter now I can stand up now watch this example absolutely beautiful example I only know two or three words in a different language that I know now I'm going to say this one literal not spiritual now what what he's going to do he's going to say some words in another language this is not him speaking in tongues but he's going to say some words in Africans I'm going to say be be AK will Africans spren now I doubt whether there's a person here that knows what I said yeah brother what I say so there happened to be a brother that was there in the meeting Africans Bea Bea blah I am very very happy I'm here to speak Africans Africans speaking I am here to speak Africans when I read this I thought it was absolutely awesome that God worked it out with there was a man there that could be able to speak a foreign language so here is an example of an interpret so if someone jumps up and speaks in tongues and they say three or four words in tongues and then someone jumps up and they're supposedly interpreting those tongues and their interpretation has about 50 or 75 words and that person spoke in tongues and said five now I realize some languages are different I don't I don't know Spanish there's just a few words I know in Spanish Taco Chim changa you know burrito oh y'all know them too but from what I'm told Spanish can be a much more descriptive language than English having preached brother George Smith and brother Danny Su uh you know I I've heard them and I would say say three or four words and they might say five or six because the Spanish language is a little bit more descriptive and it would take a few more words to say the same thing as we would in English but whenever you see someone then that is speaking eight or 10 words and then The Interpreter stands up and goes on and on and on and on something is wrong somewhere let me tell you where that come from carryover from 1906 now I realize some of the brothers in the message think and they say it this way well poor brother Donnie you know he come from Pentecost and it's really scarred him and and that that's why he's scared of this no that's absolutely absolutely wrong and I think sometimes some of these preachers forget that God also talks to me as a matter of fact I heard two of my friends not long ago in another realm and I heard them sitting talking about me and I heard the words they said ah and the words I just told you was some of what they said I heard them so you see it's not because I come from Pentecost I'm not basing this on Pentecost I'm basing this on the teaching of the message of the hour that we say we follow and I don't just say we say it I say we believe it it's not to take from us it's to keep us from evil spirits oh my now notice he said now what did he do I was speaking in Africans he heard me in English is that right cuz you know a cons if you're speaking in an unknown tongue and interpreting you're hearing in the language that you were born in because that's a only way you can interpret what they're saying because the Holy Spirit has interpreted it to you you're just speaking for the Holy Spirit what an awesome thing what an awesome thing wouldn't it be awesome to have these things in reality among us the real ones that the Holy Ghost this ain't just for preachers that the spirit of God could take a man or woman a boy or girl that'd be so submitted to God the Holy Ghost would take their mouths and speak a language out of them that they never heard and the same spirit of God could move on another young person and they would stand up and give exactly the interpretation how am I going to know if it's the Lord or not brother Donnie how should I know if I'm an interpreter or not you'll judge by this so if someone speaks in another language and they're talking in Aramaic they're talking in Hebrew but you hear it in English just as plain as what I'm speaking to you tonight then you know you've got a gift of interpretation praise the Lord like a precious old brother gone on he's in glory tonight and I I really believe that dearest old soul that I know brother Ryan all of us know him and he used to stand on the street God forgive me not to be sacri religious I know it's a blaspheming the Holy Ghost is unpardonable but brother Ryan used to say one word over and over all the time something about seek them and seek them and seek them or something like that while somebody said do you think that's of God I said certainly it's of God certainly I believe it's of God he was speaking in tongues but I couldn't say what he's saying cuz I don't know but the presence of the spirit was there so if the presence of the spirit is there and this person saying one word over and over again and this one jumps up and tries to give an interpretation yet don't know what he's saying if this man is not giving the interpretation he's prophesying but the spirit prophesying upon him he's not giving an interpretation notice again it's the spirit of God giving a message to the church interpretation it's got to be understood in English and repeat back exactly what the person said that that's the gift of interpretation it's not someone standing up well I feel led that the interpretation is this this this this and this but did you hear it in English praise the Lord adoption now I want you to notice God's thinking is so phenomenal if you speak with tongues and it's just some repeating of scripture God said don't you use vain repetition it's a message directly to somebody now a preacher is called to preach and if I get up here and preach and all the rest of the ministers you're in our church and every service I would tell you Jesus is coming soon Jesus is coming soon I'm called of God to do that but God is not going to use tongues and interpretation to do that not according to the message now what we have to do then is Judge What We Believe by the message of the hour that we say we believe and let the gifts pass through not 1906 but let them pass from the book of Acts right down through the message of the hour and anybody here tonight or anybody to hear this and I know there's going to be preachers that's going to listen to it so any of your preachers you show me in the book of Acts where they stood up and tongues and interpretation of tongues and said the Lord is coming the Rapture is at hand or something like that or repeating scripture and I'll apologize next question answers of course you can't do that can you now watch how he goes on with this in the adoption So speaking in tongues and interpretting watch how he brings it actually to be discernment in the body God don't use vain repetition but it'll be a message directly to somebody ask me one time put your finger one time that the Holy Spirit ever under discernment told somebody repeated a scripture over and over it told him something that was wrong and then something that they had had done something they must do something had to happen or something like that so now listen is speaking in tongues and interpretation now you see God knew that there would be Major Prophets that would come on the earth and they would only be here for so long and he would take them off the Earth but God wanted to have gifts in the church even when that Prophet was gone to where those gifts would be able to do that very same work so in any of you tape listening if you ever found brother brandham call somebody out and just quote scripture quote scripture quote scripture quote scripture now he actually Likens tongues and interpretation to the very same discernment that God is having him to do this is your message I've got these if you'd like to read them he says So speaking in tongues and interpretation if there's one in the church that speaks with tongues let another interpret let's say this if brother Neville would raise up and speak in tongues and this brother here give an interpretation tell this man here now watch's the examples of the messenger tell this man here that yesterday he went out and done something wrong now the doctor told him today he had cancer go make that right come back here and get right with God the man say truly that's the truth God is with you so you mean to tell me that tongues and interpretation would be something like this that brother Jonathan might speak in tongues brother Rob might interpret and the spirit of God would turn around by The Interpreter and point his finger at you and say you lied yesterday you done this and you done that and the spirit of God fell on your heart and you say Lord God Lord God I'm sorry I'm sorry Lord why that's what the prophet done and this is the way he applied tongues and interpretation why would we want to settle for a substitute out of a garbage can that tells nothing in the future does not unveil sins in people's lives but repeat scripture I heard it all my life in Pentecost nothing ever future nothing ever direct yeah the Lord love you well I reckon any of us could stand up and say that couldn't we I the Lord say I'm coming you know it's dark out there well it sure is ain't it you're in a great hour we are ain't we you don't say nothing brother brand said they told him actually set the church in order said brother brandham you put us on the spot by saying that he said you think I ain't on the spot in front of thousands of people tell them their name their address what house they live in three steps going up to your house 3905 Brown Street you went to a doctor heavy set wore glasses balding in the top of his head he told you day before yesterday you had so and so and so but he said if it's God it'll never fail praise the Lord but you see we want to operate our gifts in the comfortable Zone oh oh the Lord shows me there's somebody here tonight that's got a pain now I can't pick it up yet if it's but it's somewhere from the top of your head to the so of your feet maybe if I get closer to you I'll be able to figure it out oh wait a minute wait a minute no wait a minute no no it's somebody streaming that's what it is it and actually and we call that a gift that's a clown brother Donnie you shouldn't say that oh yes I should I am not afraid to identify something like that as an impostor I watched the Pentecostal preacher that I worked with and a television crew come to film us and I watched them speak to him and tell him you need to start calling people out and you need to tell people things and you don't have to get very very close just tell them things in general it'll help your crowd and it'll help your offering I watched that man as he started manipulating that and I watched as it increased an intensity where he went because people heard about it and their expectation got higher and higher and higher I'll tell you Friends when the gospel comes to that spot I'll step down I'll quit preaching when it comes to where that we have to make the gospel a show that's not what I'm here for you I'm here for the real reality of God we've got a table full of chicken and dumplings and all the rest of the good things of God why would we settle for something less can I have few more minutes I know I'm going a little bit over and church order he says whatever brother conin speaks brother Hickerson gives up and gives an exam gives an interpretation now here we have the prophet giving us examples an example let brother soand so write this down now we all know the Lord is coming were aware of that and brother Neville got up and preached each night got up each night and said behold the Lord is coming behold the Lord is coming that would be all right but he's the pastor at the platform he's got the word for that tongues interpretation of tongues which is prophecy or a prophet speaking that's something not written in the word wow what's written in the word word he's to bring it but what's not written in the word is what you're to tell him for instance tell brother wheeler thus sayith the Lord tomorrow in the sand pit not to go down to it because there'll be a truck turn over it'll be something like that it's got to be done and you spoke it he interpreted then lay it on the platform after your ministry is finished now listen why I wanted this to be this way and this day when there's been so much confusion about it and it causes a stumbling block let one speaking in tongues another interpre and give the message and let it be read right off at the platform of what's going to take place and let it happen you see what happens tell them tomorrow at a certain time or next week at a certain time there's going to be a certain thing let the unbeliever sit there and listen to that and see it before it happen foretold by the spirit of God it's going to happen they'll know what kind of spirit it is among you can I read one more got a few nods now I believe in speaking in tongu I believe in interpretation but it now do we believe these musts are actually musts y'all believe the ter must I do too Lord help us it must be something directly to the church not not the Lord is coming soon or something which is all right don't use vain repution so you see when people are doing that they're breaking the scripture by doing it they're doing exactly what Jesus said don't do that's not what tongues and interpretation is that's what I'm supposed to do that's what these ministers are supposed to do the Lord's coming the Lord's coming Everybody Get Ready Get Ready Get ready and then God is going to speak in tongues and give interpretation and the form of Prophecy and going to stand up and tell you the same thing that I just got done telling you either one of two things friends we're going to have to acknowledge that we do not believe the prophet's teaching on the gifts or we're going to have to acknowledge we have been wrong it ain't never been too hard for me to admit I've been wrong since I've been wrong most of my life I've run into a lot of Christians that can't say they're sorry I've probably said that as much as I've said Jesus or A lot of other things is common terms to me because I've been so sorry and so wrong and I figure I'll continue to say it probably 5 minutes before I'm changed I'm so sorry but I'm so glad I can say I'm sorry aren't you aren't you glad you can say I have been wrong so let's bring it back to the first question the spirit of truth will acknowledge these quotes and believe me this is only a small handful I I woke up day before yesterday about 4:00 I laid there for 10 15 minutes something like that I knew I wasn't going to be able to go back to sleep so I eased up real easy got out of the bed went and got dressed and everything went out got my laptop starting to answer some of these questions and I sat there in in in the room by myself and I felt the presence of the Lord come near and my heart was so heavy thinking about this night and thinking that there have been an element of people that'll get mad at me and some that'll cut me off and some say brother Donnie don't believe in the move of God well let me tell you something that is a lie I do believe in the move of God but it is the move of God I want I don't want my people fed out of a garbage can whether I'm preaching or somebody else is preaching to you I want you fed chicken and dumplings ham meat steak Big Mac whatever it is you like you know whatever it is you need I don't want you having to go down the garbage can of Pentecost and merging it with acts two and try to push that down my throat and say this is the bride's Revival no it ain't because it don't line up as what the prophet taught us I want a bride's Revival don't you I want a bride's Revival but a bride's Revival is not going to lead me back to what I came out of I left that because it made me sick to my stomach why would I want to go back to it but you realize some of the message preachers were not in Pentecost and let me be honest with you from my heart and all close I used to despise my years of being in Pentecost I used to hate it and I thought God why did you leave me in that mess I wasted years of my life but as I've went on I begin to realize he had a reason for letting me come through there so I'd be able to recognize and see whenever some of the same Pentecostal stuff would start coming right inside of our message and some of the brothers have not been there so they don't recognize it that I'd be able to look by the grace of God and say no no no no that that's what that's what we had back there and what did it lead to carnal impersonation false prophecies why did Brother Ram even have to say in order to his own church because he said they was saying things that never come to pass and then what will it produce this one speaks in tongues and it will it will compel people to stand and give a prophecy or an interpretation even if it's wrong because if not that person will have to be corrected and say look brother sister don't speak speak in tongues again unless there's an interpreter well that really makes folks mad when you do that believe me I've had to do it before so what will we do we will be compelled to perform God help us no no brother Donnie would would you want would you welcome the gifts in our church it's all of my heart but I'm want the real ones what I we welcome tongues interpretation would I welcome yes I would I would God's Prophet said ananas and Safara will return to the church remember Peter was not a prophet and when they walked before him God revealed to him by the Holy Ghost what they had done and they dropped dead you talking about getting people right with God if we had that in our own assembly and people come in they say whoa whoa be careful now be be careful I ain't talking about hitting and missing I ain't talking about saying things in generalities when even if you miss people can't tell it I'm talking about being so precise tell brother wheeler not to go to the sand pit that's the kind of God I serve L's stand well after tonight y'all may not want no more question answers huh God bless you young people I love you so much if the Lord terries there's no way for us to know how long will this go on will there be another generation I I don't see how there could be but if there was some of you Brothers will be the deacons some of you Brothers will be the preachers the pastors you will be the ones that'll be standing up here and I'll be sitting on the front row maybe like brother Benton an old man we don't want to turn our church over and the carrying on of the message to a group of people say ah we don't need that no more a that's oldfashioned we want it to carry on don't we to the coming of the Lord Jesus how many like to be remembered tonight as we pray heavenly father as we stand before you tonight Lord and I thank you for these young people Lord God I thank you for these questions they've asked some awesome questions Lord Lord I I I just pray that you would help each of us father that we would be able to listen with an open heart and as I said I've had these here were some of the first ones that I got probably five six weeks ago and some I got just a few weeks ago and they're tremendous questions and I'm studying on them the inspiration the spirit of God oh Lord just made them so real and I I thank you thank you for it dear God we want to be right Lord we're not gathered here tonight to be deceived we've not come here tonight hoping that some evil spirit would get on us we want your spirit we want the spirit of Truth so how can we tell if we got the Holy Ghost because the spirit in us will line us up with the teaching of the hour and it won't cut in and cut out well I like this I don't like this I like this I don't like that that's not the Holy Ghost father help us that we will align our faith our thoughts our ideology our Doctrine with the word of God through the teaching of the message of the hour Lord you know my heart I want a Revival Among Us I want real genuine move of God I say it before you tonight and those that'll hear it pour out your gifts Among Us Lord but I want the real I want the genuine I don't want it to be as I've seen before and even seen it some of the message where it hits and misses and hits and misses I don't want a hit and a miss we want the genuine you don't hit and miss Lord you hit every time help us Lord God I wonder Lord if there won't be that short quick something that'll come upon the earth oh Father may we be able to be ready for it I pray in the name of Jesus help us Lord don't let it pass before us father but we want to be sure and you don't get angry when we judge things by by the word as a matter of fact your Prophet tells us them Ephesian Christians they judge them Apostles and they went stood right in their face and told them and called them Liars The Prophet said wow that is so bold how could they do that they told them to their face you are liars because you're not saying what the prophet said help us to realize the spirit of God will always agree with the word and the spirit of God can always try the word and the word don't get nervous because it will say Amen to every word of God we love you Jesus We Worship You Lord we praise you tonight father if there's one here Lord that don't have the Holy Ghost oh Jesus may you pass through this building again like you did last night father maybe there's some young people here and they're struggling with this or that or the other May the presence of God come through this way Lord maybe they're dealing with a besetting sin or something Lord that's really pulling on them and they're fighting a battle and maybe they're not winning every day maybe they're losing some but may you help them Jesus Oh granted I pray father May the angels of God which are here present pass through this place tonight granted I pray Lord God oh Jesus we open our hearts to you

error in my teaching an error in my Doctrine an error in my life anything about me that displeases you show me Lord show me Lord hallelujah in your own way young people are you willing to say the same thing before him tonight Lord if I believe something wrong show me if I'm doing something wrong if if it's music then I'm listening to it if I'm reading some books I shouldn't if I'm looking at Movies Lord that a Christian should not look at deal with me Lord show me show me oh Jesus we bless your name father hallelujah hallelujah praise your Holy Name father brother Joe so thankful for that thinking the Holy Ghost you know was something that I dealt with in my life for for many years years as a young young man wondering if I had the Holy Ghost and I remember I went to my uncle one time I just and I asked him I said how just the devil would beat me down with it how do how do I know I had the Holy Ghost and I'll never forget his answer he just said what is your heart's desire tell what's your heart's desire are those desires matching Gods it's not complicated we complicated that's the devil Devil's going to complicate it for you if you remember many years ago I we did question answers on the Holy Ghost and I a brother asked I said brother Zach you want some cookies what do you do if you at home and you want cookies he said I go get them because they're free Holy Ghost is a free gift for brother the Bible says it's freely given God wants to give it to you more than you want it and that's the we we look at and then the life that we live and in lay out of sea and the age that we're in how it's going crazy it's the devil is is so trying so hard to get you your mind on so many things social media the the things that you go to school the things that work people pulling you this way pulling you that way getting into this group into that group everything he can do to keep you off one thing and that one thing is the Holy Ghost that's but it as we here tonight you know it's God's life in you so if you you you don't have the Holy Ghost and you want the Holy Ghost tonight we'll pray with you we'll stay here as long as you want to stay we'll pray with you as long as you want to pray but if devil has put it in your mind I don't have it yet I suggest you not leave here till God settles that for you and it's it's one of the it's it it's not you know growing up you know I I I'd come up and I'd see guys that I looked up to I want to be like that guy and I see him come up and pray and and and and beat the Altar and for two weeks they're front row within 3 weeks they're missing church again running out drinking listening to rock and roll two months later they're back back and forth back and forth the Holy Ghost won't pull you in and out that's right holy ghost will pull you in to keep you that's right you will never if you get the Holy Ghost you'll never want to go back out you'll not want anything this word will mean more to you than anything any greater best car best clothes anything you would ever want once you get that Holy Ghost there's nothing that means more to you than living this word because it's not you you anyways it's it's him we're going to let brother Jesse sing some songs you want to come up and pray we'll pray with you myself brother Rob brother Donnie brother John Tim we we'll pray for you you want the Holy Ghost the
