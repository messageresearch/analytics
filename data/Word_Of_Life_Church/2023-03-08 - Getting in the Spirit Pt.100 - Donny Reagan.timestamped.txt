[46:51] walk a different walk and talk a
[46:52] different talk with me
[46:54] praise the Lord isn't it awesome to be
[46:56] back in the house of God tonight
[46:59] in the presence of the Lord
[47:01] oh I love going to church I love being
[47:04] where the saints of God are I love being
[47:07] where he is
[47:08] goes where he is
[47:10] good things are going to happen
[47:12] turn to listen to me tonight to the book
[47:14] of Zechariah if you would
[47:17] hurt brother Joel did an awesome job
[47:19] here Sunday certainly appreciate that
[47:21] brother Joel God bless you brother
[47:30] Zechariah Chapter 6 verse 11.
[47:34] we're going to talk about him tonight
[47:36] how great he is
[47:38] what a great thing he has in his mind
[47:40] what he wants to accomplish
[47:42] which we believe by his grace that we're
[47:44] part of
[47:47] then take silver and gold and make
[47:49] crowns and sit upon the head of Joshua
[47:52] a son of Joe sedek the high priest
[47:55] speak unto him saying thus speaketh the
[47:58] Lord of hosts saying behold the man
[48:01] whose name is the branch
[48:04] he shall go up out of his place
[48:07] he shall build the Temple of the Lord
[48:11] even he shall build the Temple of the
[48:14] Lord and He Shall bear the glory
[48:17] now unlike Moses unlike Solomon on like
[48:21] zerubbabel unlike these people restoring
[48:24] this Temple unlike Herod he will be the
[48:27] only one that can build the Temple of
[48:29] the Lord and have the Temple of the
[48:31] Lord's Glory living inside of him
[48:35] notice what he will do you'll bring
[48:37] forth twofold of what no other man was
[48:40] ever allowed to do in the Old Testament
[48:43] he shall bear the glory and he shall sit
[48:45] and Rule upon his throne so he's going
[48:49] to be a king
[48:50] but also he shall be a priest upon his
[48:54] throne
[48:55] so kingship and priesthood will be
[48:59] merged together
[49:00] in this man whose name is the branch and
[49:04] the council listen to this of Peace
[49:07] shall be between them both so nor the
[49:11] words between kingship and priesthood
[49:14] will be a council of Peace merging
[49:17] together not in two men which is typical
[49:20] for the Old Testament once they come to
[49:22] the time of Kings but not so here
[49:25] because this man will bear both and that
[49:29] he's going to build a new order it will
[49:31] be called the order of Melchizedek the
[49:35] worshipers will worship him not in
[49:37] ritual and in routine but they will
[49:40] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[49:43] is that the kind of worshipers we want
[49:45] to be tonight
[49:46] let's bow our heads together
[49:49] I wonder how many he'd like to be
[49:51] remembered before the Lord
[49:53] God bless you like you to remember Erica
[49:56] tomorrow if you would she's gone to
[49:58] Nashville today and uh her and Lance and
[50:01] set an MRI this evening be having her
[50:04] third treatment tomorrow I begin about 7
[50:08] 30 in the morning their time about 8 30
[50:10] hour time if you'd be remembering her
[50:12] that all will go well the spirit of God
[50:15] will just take that stuff and go after
[50:17] them them Devils inside that body and
[50:20] kill them
[50:21] amen heavenly father it's so good to be
[50:25] in your house tonight Lord
[50:27] so good to see your children again
[50:30] we're so blessed father to be able to
[50:32] gather together how I thank you for
[50:35] Wednesday night's service
[50:37] I know there's people all over the world
[50:39] that would love to be able to come to
[50:41] church on Wednesday night but because of
[50:44] their particular setting some of the
[50:46] ones in Africa don't have their own
[50:48] buildings some of them in India don't
[50:50] have their own building some in the
[50:52] states don't even have their own
[50:54] buildings so they can have a midweek
[50:57] service but all how we love midweek
[51:00] service father
[51:01] it's just such a boost to us and helps
[51:03] us and we want you to know that we are
[51:06] grateful to finally be in our new place

[51:11] of all we want to thank you that you've
[51:13] gathered here with us what good would a
[51:16] fanciest Place nicest place that was

[52:46] seated love you so much tonight
[52:52] all my heart is
[52:55] just soul
[52:57] moved for
[53:00] the presence of God
[53:03] seeing what he wants to accomplish
[53:07] in our day
[53:09] let's get just a little view of it
[53:14] the first man and first woman in the
[53:16] Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony
[53:18] with God
[53:19] so much that God could come down at any
[53:22] time
[53:24] he desired and talk lip to ear
[53:28] was Adam and Eve
[53:30] that is perfect Oneness
[53:33] God and His creation
[53:36] but speaking lit to ear God speaking lip
[53:40] to ear with Adam and Eve and they were
[53:42] in so perfect in harmony with God till
[53:46] they were one with God
[53:48] and his family was one
[53:52] any man in his family a correct good
[53:55] Noble obedient family is one with one
[53:59] another any family
[54:02] and if there's any something notice this
[54:04] now there's something in the family that
[54:07] moves them apart
[54:09] then it's not right
[54:11] now listen if there's something that
[54:14] comes in their family
[54:16] that moves them apart
[54:18] it's not right now watch how he ties the
[54:22] first and original family in the Garden
[54:24] of Eden
[54:25] and how that their original position and
[54:28] place was that God could come down any
[54:31] time he desired
[54:33] and talk to both Adam and Eve not just
[54:35] the man but both Adam and Eve
[54:38] everything was perfect there was no
[54:41] sickness no sorrow no death no suffering
[54:45] notice he goes on to say
[54:47] if there's something in the family that
[54:49] moves them apart then it's not right the
[54:52] families broken somewhere they should
[54:55] all be one father was Mother Mother with
[54:59] father
[55:00] children with parent parent with
[55:03] children all in agreement and when you
[55:07] see that now listen what you'll see when
[55:10] you see that you'll see one lovely
[55:14] picture
[55:16] now this picture is the first one in the
[55:20] episode of God's Great Museum
[55:24] it was a great Divine gallery
[55:28] that after father created the universe
[55:32] and expanded his creation to the Earth
[55:36] now Satan of course
[55:38] had fallen before the Earth's Foundation
[55:40] was ever laid
[55:43] and actually uh preached it done it
[55:45] brother Jason's this weekend that
[55:47] whenever the Angels fell
[55:50] then when God started bringing this
[55:52] earth into existence Satan walked up and
[55:55] down this Earth when the Earth was
[55:57] belching out volcanic rocks and Ash
[56:01] and our bodies were being spewed out of
[56:05] the heart of the earth calcium potash
[56:07] petroleum Cosmic lights copper magnesium
[56:12] all these things that God needed for the
[56:15] material to make our bodies but for our
[56:18] bodies were ever formed
[56:20] Satan was walking up and down the Earth
[56:22] and left his Footprints in volcanic ash
[56:26] because Footprints means possession
[56:30] so Satan claimed this Earth he wanted it
[56:33] at his as his own but again we go back
[56:37] to what we were singing
[56:39] I looked all over and I looked for
[56:41] somebody that could create a blade of
[56:45] grass but have found nobody
[56:48] I went down to hell and I asked oh Satan
[56:53] can you make me just one fly what about
[56:56] one apple what about one peach what
[56:59] about one anything can you make anything
[57:03] I searched all over her but I couldn't
[57:07] find nobody you know why because there
[57:10] ain't but one Creator and that's
[57:13] almighty God
[57:15] Satan couldn't make a nurse the way our
[57:18] father could
[57:19] he could not make subjects so he had to
[57:22] pervert what God had created that's why
[57:25] it's after you and I tonight
[57:28] and Satan purposed in his being to have
[57:32] this place
[57:33] he didn't have a wife he didn't have a
[57:36] family but what he did had by this stage
[57:39] was Angelic beings who had crossed the
[57:43] line of mercy and remember when Angels
[57:46] Fall there is no Redemption the Lord
[57:49] Jesus never died for Angels but for
[57:52] human beings oh I'm so glad today
[57:56] so something come between this first
[57:59] family I hope you understand this really
[58:01] it's quite simple
[58:03] when Satan found what would work against
[58:06] the first human being that he tested
[58:09] he's never changed it that much he just
[58:13] keeps updating his tactics but using
[58:16] some of the same things and that is to
[58:20] pull people out of their god-given
[58:23] position
[58:24] if he can pull one person in a family
[58:27] out of their position it can throw the
[58:31] entire family out of the will of God
[58:34] that's what happened in the Garden of
[58:36] Eden but before he ever got to Eve he
[58:40] had to pull apart of God's creation
[58:43] other than man out of his position and
[58:46] that was of course we know the serpent
[58:48] by pulling him out then he was able to
[58:52] have a tool or an instrument that was a
[58:56] go-between the missing link that science
[58:59] still looks for and we know that that
[59:02] was the tool that Satan used then he
[59:05] come to the woman pulled her out of her
[59:08] place he could not make Adam leave his
[59:11] place so he come to the woman and out of
[59:15] Adam's love for her then Adam was
[59:18] willing to step out of his place for her
[59:21] so what do you see the whole story is
[59:24] beings getting out of their place
[59:28] and Satan loves to do that still to this
[59:31] very day
[59:32] now I want you to notice the prophet
[59:33] said when you see that father mother
[59:36] children father loves mother mother
[59:39] loves father children love parents
[59:41] parents love children and then they have
[59:44] this beautiful lovely picture and God
[59:48] placed it there and what a beautiful
[59:51] piece of art that it was now you know I
[59:55] know art differs according to the very
[59:57] uh you know the variety of people's
[59:59] taste and I've been to a lot of the
[1:00:01] beautiful museums around the world and
[1:00:03] I've walked into some of those museums
[1:00:05] and some of them you stand there and you
[1:00:07] look at that art and you think
[1:00:10] what is that
[1:00:12] any all ever been there some of the art
[1:00:15] that you see springing up around Johnson
[1:00:17] City you know some of these things that
[1:00:20] are made by artists and I think I think
[1:00:22] I made something like that when I was a
[1:00:24] five-year-old boy I should have kept it
[1:00:26] they don't tell what had been worse now
[1:00:27] so some of the stuff they called Art
[1:00:30] today I'm sure I'm sure that it's only
[1:00:32] me and I just don't have an eye for it
[1:00:35] probably but I like looking at a human
[1:00:37] when you can look at him and you know
[1:00:39] they're a human being instead of trying
[1:00:41] to figure out if they're a dog or a cat
[1:00:43] or a you really don't know by the
[1:00:46] way that some people draw it and to me
[1:00:48] when I look at that type of art
[1:00:50] so-called I like the Masters myself I
[1:00:54] like the rendition of the Master's art
[1:00:56] and whenever they would make it during
[1:00:58] the Renaissance time and thereafter and
[1:01:01] they would make those drawings of those
[1:01:03] animals and beings human beings and so
[1:01:05] on and they're so real that you almost
[1:01:08] just want to reach out and touch them
[1:01:10] there's something about them that is so
[1:01:13] compelling that pulls on you and then
[1:01:16] others you just stand there and look at
[1:01:17] it you just think wow I just I have to
[1:01:20] think about this is that a dog or a cat
[1:01:23] or is that a wall is that a two before
[1:01:25] is it a pile of garbage I mean you know
[1:01:27] it just leaves you away
[1:01:29] mesmerized and people just walk away and
[1:01:32] say man man wasn't that something I'm
[1:01:35] saying you it sure was brother I don't
[1:01:38] know what it was and if I ever figured
[1:01:40] out I might let you know but you just
[1:01:42] think my goodness and that's the way the
[1:01:45] church natural has become so you look at
[1:01:48] it and you see that it's death and got
[1:01:50] the touch of a master but it looks out
[1:01:52] to master of deception to me and it
[1:01:55] looks like some of this modern art or it
[1:01:58] doesn't even look like the original
[1:02:00] picture that God made how many believes
[1:02:02] God's original artist
[1:02:04] well according to what the prophet said
[1:02:06] then that was God's purpose and his
[1:02:10] purpose listen these words together just
[1:02:12] absolutely awesome his purpose as father
[1:02:15] Supreme father Supreme was to be one
[1:02:21] with his Earthly family Adam and Eve and
[1:02:25] the only way that they could be one with
[1:02:27] the family or with God was because God's
[1:02:31] nature was in them now God now notice it
[1:02:35] was not that they just obeyed the word
[1:02:37] do this yes Father do that yes Father do
[1:02:40] that yes father but actually God's
[1:02:43] nature was in them now I can't explain
[1:02:46] to you exactly how that was but I do
[1:02:49] know whatever it was that Adam and Eve
[1:02:51] had whatever experience they had with
[1:02:54] God in the Garden of Eden they were able
[1:02:57] to lose it and they were able to fall
[1:03:01] away from it so myself brother Daryl I
[1:03:04] desire something more than what Adam had
[1:03:08] so that I'll never fall away from it you
[1:03:11] understand what I'm saying now had God
[1:03:14] gave Adam and Eve the Seal of the
[1:03:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost I we have
[1:03:19] today that would be no way they would
[1:03:21] have ever fallen from what they had but
[1:03:24] they had something that was temporal
[1:03:27] something a special allotment of God
[1:03:31] according to the first dispensation of
[1:03:34] man under the stage of Innocence let me
[1:03:37] say it that way and God gave it to them
[1:03:40] knowing that they could and would fall
[1:03:43] from it but yet it was something that
[1:03:45] must have been awesome at the time but
[1:03:48] something that they could regress from
[1:03:50] an Adam of course choosing to do that
[1:03:54] and when he did he throwed us wherever
[1:03:56] he are today now notice in Father's
[1:03:58] purpose was was to be not only father
[1:04:01] but father Supreme now I wanted not not
[1:04:04] only to be a father but father Supreme
[1:04:08] in other words there'd never be another
[1:04:10] father that would ever be above him now
[1:04:13] he didn't just want to be plain old
[1:04:15] father but he wanted to be father
[1:04:17] Supreme so he wanted to be everything
[1:04:19] that his children would ever have need
[1:04:22] of and then he put this allocation of
[1:04:25] his own nature inside of them so when
[1:04:27] they come up to God to worship they
[1:04:30] somehow knew what God wanted I really
[1:04:32] think this is what's missing today in so
[1:04:35] many worshipers because a lot of the
[1:04:37] worshipers in the age were living they
[1:04:39] don't know what God wants so that you
[1:04:41] know they they're trying to worship and
[1:04:43] wave their hands a certain way or they
[1:04:45] hold their hands a certain way it's sad
[1:04:47] but many of the message folks are the
[1:04:48] same way they really don't understand
[1:04:50] what worship really is they don't
[1:04:52] understand what to give God what he
[1:04:54] wants one of the meanings of the word
[1:04:56] worship is a supreme and divine
[1:04:59] adoration for something so it's not even
[1:05:02] moving your hands all the meanings of
[1:05:05] worship have nothing to do with some
[1:05:08] movement of the body but it projects
[1:05:10] from the heart and when it comes from
[1:05:13] the heart it will put the body in motion
[1:05:16] now people can have the body in motion
[1:05:18] and still not have the heart and tune
[1:05:20] then you're really still in a mess but I
[1:05:23] want my heart to be in tune and they
[1:05:25] don't want to set my body in motion with
[1:05:27] it don't you but I want to make sure
[1:05:29] that it's in the right way so we tonight
[1:05:32] is the worshipers of God should have a
[1:05:35] desire do we to want to know what father
[1:05:37] wants what do we want to just give him
[1:05:39] what we think he wants do we want to
[1:05:41] just say well you know just give him
[1:05:43] whatever you think he wants I don't want
[1:05:44] to do that myself I want if I want to
[1:05:47] worship him I want to give him what he
[1:05:49] wants from me
[1:05:51] now notice he says this way isn't it a
[1:05:55] beautiful picture God and his family
[1:05:57] father over all Supreme no death no
[1:06:00] sorrow no heartaches no nothing but joy
[1:06:03] unspeakable never to be sick never to
[1:06:05] have a heartache just one with God what
[1:06:08] a picture what a picture because the
[1:06:11] very nature of God was in these people
[1:06:15] and therefore what they did they
[1:06:18] followed just in line with God and God
[1:06:21] with them made them one what a union a
[1:06:25] Oneness that would it be to see God in
[1:06:28] his church now what she brings it Beyond
[1:06:30] Adam and Eve and brings it to us this is
[1:06:32] preached in 1962. what a union a one
[1:06:35] that said would be to see God in his
[1:06:37] church sell every member is just
[1:06:39] perfectly in harmony with each other and
[1:06:43] God now this is what father Supreme
[1:06:46] wants father Supreme does not want each
[1:06:50] of us to pick out his certain man and
[1:06:53] then all of us will basically just go
[1:06:56] along with every man every word that man
[1:06:58] says and we will be just just people for
[1:07:01] that man yes brother Donnie yes brother
[1:07:03] Donnie yes brother dark yes brother Tim
[1:07:06] yes whoever it is that you're going to
[1:07:08] follow and that's why you think Oneness
[1:07:10] is no you become a robot but Oneness is
[1:07:14] the people of God getting God's divine
[1:07:16] nature by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:19] we will still have our own personality
[1:07:22] and I don't want to break any
[1:07:23] ideological balloons that you have but
[1:07:26] we will never on the earth get to a
[1:07:29] place to where everybody sees exactly
[1:07:32] the same thing about everything else
[1:07:35] never because we are human beings we're
[1:07:38] always going to have a different opinion
[1:07:40] about this a different view about that
[1:07:42] there will be some folks in the message
[1:07:44] and they will sit there and worship God
[1:07:46] they'll never run around the church
[1:07:48] there'll be others that will run
[1:07:49] there'll be others that will jump and
[1:07:51] Shout well now praise the Lord and yet
[1:07:53] if both of them are worshiping with all
[1:07:55] of us are heart whether or not you
[1:07:57] understand it and believe it God accept
[1:07:59] both of them in exactly the same way
[1:08:01] because they're responding according to
[1:08:04] what he led them to do now it may not
[1:08:07] please you and it may not please me so
[1:08:09] much but after all we're not here to
[1:08:11] please one another are we we're here to
[1:08:13] please God right so we will never get to
[1:08:17] a spot to where even all the preachers
[1:08:19] are all sit down and they'll discuss the
[1:08:21] godhead and they'll discuss
[1:08:23] predestination election for knowledge
[1:08:25] and they'll set down to every one of
[1:08:27] them will tea totally agree never
[1:08:29] that'll never happen as long as when
[1:08:31] this Mortal realm but there is a Oneness
[1:08:34] that every member of the Bride must have
[1:08:37] and will have before the Rapture takes
[1:08:41] place that Oneness in Christ will help
[1:08:44] us and give us tolerance for those who
[1:08:48] see things a little bit different than
[1:08:50] we do but you know what we tend to get
[1:08:53] into a denominational Forum to where
[1:08:56] people don't sit the way we do then
[1:08:58] they're off the word well first of all
[1:09:01] God didn't make you the judge or me the
[1:09:03] judge the word is the judge and remember
[1:09:06] many times those that have quotes to
[1:09:08] back up their idea it come from the same
[1:09:10] message and you get the quotes that back
[1:09:12] up your idea well which prophet was it
[1:09:15] that was true well the same man saying
[1:09:17] the same statements and just different
[1:09:19] settings now watch it is the only
[1:09:22] grounds of Fellowship that God has ever
[1:09:24] laid down for himself and his church is
[1:09:28] the Oneness of himself in the people now
[1:09:30] remember Zechariah prophesied about a
[1:09:33] man that would come and would build the
[1:09:35] Temple of the Lord and as I said before
[1:09:37] the Lord Jesus would not even have been
[1:09:40] able to enter into the holiest of holies
[1:09:43] because he was not a levite he was
[1:09:46] natural genetically his Natural Body he
[1:09:49] was of the tribe of Judah not of Levi so
[1:09:52] he could have never offered a sacrifice
[1:09:54] in the temple yet he offered his body in
[1:09:56] the presence of God they would have
[1:09:58] never let him go inside of there and
[1:10:00] read the Torah he would never have been
[1:10:02] able to offer a sacrifice in that
[1:10:04] amazing man would have never let the
[1:10:06] Lord Jesus offer to sacrifice but
[1:10:09] almighty God created that body and said
[1:10:12] offer it to me and Bible accept it and
[1:10:15] forgive every person that accepted from
[1:10:17] now until the end of time
[1:10:19] but yet as far as they looked at it he
[1:10:22] would have never been allowed to even
[1:10:24] step in behind the holiest of holies
[1:10:26] because he could not go in behind the
[1:10:28] veil and his body was the veil so you
[1:10:32] see when man gets it all so cut and
[1:10:34] dried and man's got it boy this is
[1:10:37] exactly the way it is and there's no
[1:10:38] room for growing and there's no more
[1:10:40] room you know instead of putting a comma
[1:10:43] we put a period at the end of it bless
[1:10:45] God this is what I believe and I ain't
[1:10:48] moving uh oh you're already cut and dry
[1:10:50] ain't you you better put a comet into
[1:10:52] that this is what I believe today but
[1:10:55] I'm subject to change tomorrow if I find
[1:10:57] another quote or another scripture oh
[1:10:59] you said how can you be that because I'm
[1:11:01] a growing man in the body of God that's
[1:11:03] why
[1:11:05] now notice God's idea of Oneness is
[1:11:09] himself in the people that's the only
[1:11:11] grounds of Fellowship the only way that
[1:11:13] you can have those grounds is by a union
[1:11:16] to be United with him forever now you
[1:11:19] see Adam did not have this in the union
[1:11:22] of the soul to be able to be United
[1:11:24] forever what if it was that he had could
[1:11:27] come in him and go back out of him and
[1:11:30] not seal him but this Oneness built by
[1:11:33] the man whose name is the branch will
[1:11:36] seal the people of God and they will
[1:11:38] never be able to be broken out of this
[1:11:40] listen to this in paragraph 23 joined in
[1:11:43] Heavenly wedlock to the Eternal God part
[1:11:48] of him part of God joined in Heavenly
[1:11:53] wedlock to the Eternal God part of him
[1:11:58] part of God now when we come into the
[1:12:01] New Testament we find that Paul was the
[1:12:04] Great Master children now Peter never
[1:12:06] said that about himself nor did John nor
[1:12:08] did any of the other authors of the New
[1:12:10] Testament but Paul felt the Liberty to
[1:12:13] be able to identify himself as a master
[1:12:16] builder that's quite a statement for a
[1:12:18] man to make but Paul knew that God had
[1:12:21] given him the message of that day and he
[1:12:24] was not only a preacher he was not only
[1:12:26] an apostle but he was a prophet
[1:12:28] messenger he was not a prophet like
[1:12:30] agabus which the spirit of God could
[1:12:33] come on him he could take Paul's girdle
[1:12:35] go out there and wrap it around his
[1:12:36] hands and say thus saith the Lord the
[1:12:38] man whose this is he's going to
[1:12:40] Jerusalem to be bound now agribus was
[1:12:43] that type of a prophet Paul was more
[1:12:45] than that Paul was a prophet messenger
[1:12:48] now there is a difference we didn't just
[1:12:51] need a prophet in this day we needed
[1:12:54] also a prophet messenger I don't think
[1:12:57] sometimes even the message people
[1:12:59] understand the difference a prophet is a
[1:13:02] man that God can be able to speak to him
[1:13:04] showing future events showing things
[1:13:06] even in people's lives but a prophet
[1:13:09] messenger is one who brings a turn in
[1:13:11] the road he brings a dispensational
[1:13:14] change he brings an Enlightenment above
[1:13:18] his brothers now Peter had some great
[1:13:20] things to say all the rest of the
[1:13:22] brothers in the New Testament had great
[1:13:24] things to say but none of them can you
[1:13:26] imagine if we would strip out what is
[1:13:28] called the Pauline Epistles out of the
[1:13:30] New Testament if we would take out uh
[1:13:33] first and second Corinthians in
[1:13:34] Philippians and Thessalonians and
[1:13:36] Timothy and Titus and Philemon and all
[1:13:39] the Pauline Epistles can you imagine
[1:13:40] what we would have left we would have
[1:13:43] the four gospels we would have Jude we
[1:13:45] would have James and we would have first
[1:13:47] and second third John and the Book of
[1:13:49] Revelation all the rest of the New
[1:13:51] Testament we would be totally deprived
[1:13:53] of we wouldn't know what to think about
[1:13:54] election because Paul wrote more about
[1:13:56] it than all the rest of them put
[1:13:58] together we would know how the churches
[1:14:00] to operate we would know nothing about
[1:14:02] dress because John never preached
[1:14:04] nothing about rest John never said
[1:14:06] nothing about women's hair well come on
[1:14:08] somebody James never said nothing about
[1:14:10] women's hair Paul was the one that was
[1:14:13] given the great truth to tithe the
[1:14:16] people of God into a Oneness I know a
[1:14:18] lot of folks don't like theology they
[1:14:20] don't like Doctrine all they want is
[1:14:23] just a little experience with Jesus to
[1:14:25] where he saves him from hell and lets
[1:14:27] them live any way they want to don't
[1:14:28] talk to me about all that stuff I don't
[1:14:30] need it well apparently you do because
[1:14:32] the Bible is full of it
[1:14:34] praise the Lord but you see it comes
[1:14:38] under a prophet messenger now don't
[1:14:39] doubt the people in that data said man
[1:14:42] Paul confuses me he writes all this
[1:14:44] stuff we don't need to understand all
[1:14:46] that we're saved what more do we need we
[1:14:48] know you need to know how to love one
[1:14:50] another husbands need to know how to
[1:14:52] love their wives wives need to know how
[1:14:54] to love their husband and the Saints
[1:14:55] said children need to know how to obey
[1:14:58] their parents come on Saints and the
[1:15:00] church needs to know how to behave
[1:15:02] itself of the house of God is that right
[1:15:04] but are those things always Pleasant
[1:15:06] they're not but they are building blocks
[1:15:09] and making up this body that the great
[1:15:12] master builder wanted to achieve so all
[1:15:15] the other ministers then would fit
[1:15:17] underneath what Paul had preached now
[1:15:20] what he preached and what James wrote
[1:15:22] and what Peter wrote and what John wrote
[1:15:24] it all dovetails together to make the
[1:15:26] same gospel but God approached it
[1:15:29] through diversities of gifts now this is
[1:15:31] the thing we realize Even in our local
[1:15:33] assembly that God has a diversity of
[1:15:36] gifts and our body and many times people
[1:15:40] can become you know distraught because
[1:15:42] of trying to find what God wants them to
[1:15:45] do sometimes people think well I don't
[1:15:47] know what what the Lord wants for me I
[1:15:49] don't know what does he want me he's
[1:15:50] saying does he want me to preach does he
[1:15:53] want me to testify what does he want
[1:15:54] well if he's called you then he will
[1:15:57] equip you and God will never set you to
[1:16:00] do something that himself has not given
[1:16:03] you the equipment to be able to do it so
[1:16:06] if God has called a man to preach then
[1:16:08] that man will be able to preach now the
[1:16:11] first sermon maybe even the first half a
[1:16:13] dozen or a dozen that he preaches he's
[1:16:15] going to be in the preliminary learning
[1:16:17] stage and he's going to learning how to
[1:16:19] submit to the spirit of God learning
[1:16:21] what to say and all of that and he will
[1:16:23] learn how to operate his gifts and we
[1:16:26] don't judge them when they stand up and
[1:16:27] preach two or three sermons and say he
[1:16:29] ain't called to preach now argument is
[1:16:31] how can he pray well let's give him a
[1:16:33] little time and it's the same but every
[1:16:35] other gift that God gives what is a gift
[1:16:38] in a person's life the gift is you
[1:16:41] getting yourself out of the way then God
[1:16:44] anoints that part of himself what he put
[1:16:47] inside of you and then he uses himself
[1:16:51] praise the Lord and then he uses himself
[1:16:54] inside of you and the anointing comes on
[1:16:57] you and you sing you testify or whatever
[1:17:00] it is God's called you to do lead
[1:17:02] singing or being a Sunday school teacher
[1:17:04] and the spirit of God uses you for that
[1:17:07] purpose it ministers to the body now God
[1:17:10] places the diversity of gifts in every
[1:17:13] body every local assembly he also does
[1:17:16] the same thing and every move that has
[1:17:18] been down to the ages how many Romans
[1:17:21] chapter 12 verse 3. now what's the great
[1:17:23] master builder as he goes to laying out
[1:17:26] some of these principles in the New
[1:17:28] Testament for I say through the grace
[1:17:30] given unto me to every man that is among
[1:17:34] you you not to think of himself more
[1:17:37] highly than he ought to think now notice
[1:17:40] that a man should not think of himself
[1:17:42] more highly than he ought to think but
[1:17:45] to think soberly now watch Paul is going
[1:17:49] to deal with the gifts and he's already
[1:17:51] dealt with this but at the same time if
[1:17:53] you wish to read Romans 10 Romans 11
[1:17:55] living up to this but he said now
[1:17:57] whenever you go to looking at what God
[1:17:59] has done in your life and how God has
[1:18:01] called you and how God has gifted you
[1:18:04] and now he's given us all a warning he
[1:18:06] said don't start looking at yourself and
[1:18:09] start measuring Yourself by your own
[1:18:12] view or by your own opinion of what you
[1:18:15] think well I'm this and I'm that and I'm
[1:18:18] that and I'm that but he said now
[1:18:20] according to the grace of God which has
[1:18:23] been given to me he said I say this to
[1:18:25] you that a man should not think of
[1:18:27] himself more High than what God has
[1:18:31] placed him positionally notice what he
[1:18:33] said now but to think soberly now this
[1:18:37] don't mean that you're supposed to stop
[1:18:38] drinking because these are folks that's
[1:18:40] got the Holy Ghost so that was gone a
[1:18:42] long time ago but you realize that some
[1:18:45] people though they don't drink they're
[1:18:48] not sober in the way they look at
[1:18:50] themselves and they can look at
[1:18:53] themselves wrong in two ways and they
[1:18:56] can look at that when they do they can
[1:18:58] be wrong on both accounts now if you
[1:19:02] whatever you look at yourself soberly
[1:19:04] and align with what God's giving you and
[1:19:06] what God's given you testifies of itself
[1:19:08] because every gift makes room for itself
[1:19:10] then there's also then where you can go
[1:19:13] to one extreme on the other side to
[1:19:15] where that you look at yourself and you
[1:19:18] measure yourself as being greater than
[1:19:21] actually you are
[1:19:24] so in your mind in your thinking you've
[1:19:28] got this gift and that gift and that
[1:19:30] gift and that gift and that gift and
[1:19:32] nobody recognizes it but you you think
[1:19:35] so you're never used right you're never
[1:19:37] appreciated enough you're never made
[1:19:40] over enough and then what happens is
[1:19:42] most of the time those type of people
[1:19:44] unless they get delivered from it they
[1:19:46] will start expanding in order to use
[1:19:49] what they think they have now if they do
[1:19:53] have an influence if they're a singer or
[1:19:55] don't have to even be a preacher but if
[1:19:57] they are a person of influence and a
[1:19:59] body or in a family then they will start
[1:20:02] handing out this stuff you know what I'm
[1:20:04] this and I'm that and I'm the other and
[1:20:07] they will become to intoxicate other
[1:20:10] people on their own thinking of what
[1:20:12] they are now what's this word soberly it
[1:20:15] means be sober minded to exercise
[1:20:19] self-control to put a moderate estimate
[1:20:23] upon on one's self think of oneself
[1:20:28] soberly to curb one's passion so now
[1:20:33] we're not talking about people getting
[1:20:35] drunk we're not talking about people
[1:20:37] going out lusting from women lusting for
[1:20:40] men but we're talking about people
[1:20:42] looking at themselves and having a
[1:20:45] moderate evaluation of what they are in
[1:20:49] Christ and what they think their gifts
[1:20:51] are and then also of them controlling
[1:20:55] their passion I also said this is not a
[1:20:57] lust for marijuana it's not lust for
[1:21:00] somebody else's wife but it still is a
[1:21:03] passion it is a Lust For position it is
[1:21:07] a lust for a position that many times
[1:21:11] people aren't called to handle well
[1:21:14] y'all going to get quiet on them and
[1:21:15] certain look at me or what
[1:21:17] now it whatever to be puffed up and
[1:21:21] one's own conceits is the end of
[1:21:25] spiritual progress to be puffed up in
[1:21:29] one's own conceits is the end of
[1:21:33] spiritual progress in Christ because you
[1:21:37] say why would you say that well because
[1:21:38] it's the very sound that God the devil
[1:21:41] kicked out of heaven he was formerly
[1:21:43] Lucifer which was God's right hand man
[1:21:46] the fellowship he was the one who
[1:21:48] stopped the approach to God and all that
[1:21:51] and yet whenever he began to sing of
[1:21:54] himself in a position that he was not
[1:21:57] made for he began to think of himself as
[1:22:00] what he wanted to be like God yea thou
[1:22:03] has said in the heart I will be like the
[1:22:07] most time so he began to think of
[1:22:10] himself Beyond his god-given God created
[1:22:13] ability so can you imagine this being
[1:22:17] that when we know is the devil today at
[1:22:19] one time was God's right hand man to
[1:22:22] Fellowship so in the heavens he was the
[1:22:25] great cherubim that covered he was the
[1:22:28] stopper of the approach so if any other
[1:22:31] Angels come to approach Elohim uh
[1:22:34] Lucifer stopped us oh he had a great
[1:22:36] position he was the greatest person in
[1:22:39] heaven next to God but that was not
[1:22:42] enough for him he did not want to be the
[1:22:45] greatest person next to God he wanted to
[1:22:48] be above God now you see whenever people
[1:22:51] then get saved if people cannot Satan
[1:22:54] cannot stop them from getting saved he
[1:22:57] will try to push them to the other side
[1:22:59] and make them to where they're
[1:23:01] constantly going over what God called
[1:23:03] them to be and they're in and out of
[1:23:06] trouble many people it just breaks your
[1:23:07] heart as a pastor whenever you see
[1:23:09] people that are in and out of spiritual
[1:23:11] trouble years of their life and much of
[1:23:15] it has to do with this very simple
[1:23:17] principle that they think they are more
[1:23:20] than what they really are if they were
[1:23:23] then they should be able to handle
[1:23:25] whatever it is they get into and I
[1:23:28] shouldn't have to come along behind him
[1:23:29] or any other man of God and straighten
[1:23:31] out the mess they made
[1:23:34] but it's like some people can never see
[1:23:36] it about themselves it's always
[1:23:39] everybody else is out to get them God
[1:23:42] brother Donnie don't like me brother
[1:23:43] Donnie is jealous of me let me tell you
[1:23:45] that just settle one thing for everybody
[1:23:48] here and every other person around the
[1:23:50] world there is not one mortal that lives
[1:23:54] on the earth that I am jealous of I
[1:23:57] don't want their gifts I don't want
[1:23:59] their church I don't want their wife I
[1:24:01] don't want their kids and I sure don't
[1:24:03] want their cat okay I don't want nothing
[1:24:06] I am jealous of no man I've got enough
[1:24:10] to answer to God for without jealousy I
[1:24:12] don't want this man's Pulpit I don't
[1:24:15] want this man's sheep I don't want this
[1:24:17] man's money this man's reputation this
[1:24:20] man's gift I just want to be faithful in
[1:24:23] the little bit that God has given me and
[1:24:26] I have great contentment and peace in
[1:24:29] being there because this master builder
[1:24:32] wrote it in the New Testament godliness
[1:24:35] with contentment is great gain I'll
[1:24:38] never be like brother Rod I'm not gifted
[1:24:41] the way brother Ron is I'll never preach
[1:24:43] like brother Tim my many many brothers
[1:24:45] around the message I just think my
[1:24:47] goodness I wish I could preach like that
[1:24:49] I wish I could be like that but I might
[1:24:51] as well quit wishing cause I'm done too
[1:24:52] old to start over now so I'm just stuck
[1:24:54] with who I am and you all might as well
[1:24:56] do the same thing well I wish I could be
[1:24:58] like soon so quit wasting years of your
[1:25:00] life listen you were like others just be
[1:25:03] what God's made you to be find that slot
[1:25:06] and then minister to the body
[1:25:10] oh my notice sin you know Paul goes on
[1:25:13] to say in verse 4. so as we have many
[1:25:16] members in one body now what she runs a
[1:25:19] parallel between the human body and he
[1:25:21] said all members have not the same
[1:25:23] office so we being many are one body in
[1:25:28] Christ and every one members one of
[1:25:33] another
[1:25:34] so God caused some people to preach and
[1:25:37] no my they can just hold a Spellbound by
[1:25:40] the types and the shadows and the
[1:25:42] stories and whatever others are much
[1:25:44] more simple preachers and they're not
[1:25:46] great great Dynamic preachers but maybe
[1:25:48] God will use them in healing God will
[1:25:51] use them in signs and wonders but you
[1:25:53] know the thing is that each of us find
[1:25:55] our spot and we allow each other to be
[1:25:58] what God gifted us and then we don't
[1:26:01] have to sit around and judge well I'll
[1:26:02] tell you one thing I don't like him
[1:26:04] because he Don't Preach hot brother so
[1:26:05] and so well he may know it but remember
[1:26:07] God is the one who made these gifts and
[1:26:10] apparently God didn't want everybody
[1:26:11] preaching like brother Branham or ever
[1:26:13] preacher would have preached just like
[1:26:15] brother Branham apparently God didn't
[1:26:17] want everybody preaching like brother
[1:26:18] Daryl or like brother Tim or like
[1:26:20] brother Timothy or brother Wayne Lawson
[1:26:22] or some of these other great Brothers we
[1:26:23] can mention if he did he'd make every
[1:26:26] one of them do just to call him so God
[1:26:28] would made the perfect preacher and then
[1:26:30] everybody else had packed their iPad
[1:26:31] exactly the same way they would have
[1:26:33] stuttered and
[1:26:35] you know and not hold their finger that
[1:26:37] certain certain way and that had that
[1:26:39] little certain kick every preacher would
[1:26:40] be exactly the same you'd never need an
[1:26:42] evangelist because all the advances had
[1:26:44] preached the same way and you never need
[1:26:46] a special speaker because the special
[1:26:48] speaker would preach like your special
[1:26:49] pastor and then the special Pastor would
[1:26:52] percept the special speaker and there'd
[1:26:54] be no diversity at all and before long
[1:26:56] which sat around more bored than what
[1:26:58] you are already tonight
[1:27:00] so what did God do God Diversified the
[1:27:03] body and he made some that will
[1:27:06] dramatize when they preach he made some
[1:27:08] that'll preach real fiery and he made
[1:27:11] others that are more scholarly now I
[1:27:13] know sometimes we don't like the Scotty
[1:27:15] but remember that's the attribute or the
[1:27:17] adjective that God used the prophet used
[1:27:19] rather to describe Paul he said that
[1:27:22] Peter was like a Firebrand Andrew a
[1:27:24] prayer Warrior and he said Paul was the
[1:27:27] more scholarly type so let's not be
[1:27:29] against those men that may not run
[1:27:31] around the pulpit and jump up and down
[1:27:32] and all that maybe God's called them to
[1:27:35] be exactly that way but they have an
[1:27:38] ability and input on the word that say
[1:27:40] the Firebrand don't have man it's hard
[1:27:42] to tame down a Firebrand you imagine a
[1:27:45] Firebrand preacher one Greek an Aramaic
[1:27:47] and Hebrew words he don't want to know
[1:27:49] that stuff he don't want them quotes of
[1:27:50] prayer for you to read them he blames us
[1:27:52] in here and preaches like a bolts of
[1:27:54] lightning blazes back out and he's gone
[1:27:56] somewhere else but how many knows who he
[1:27:58] needed evangelist I think
[1:27:59] share with it now watch Paul said so we
[1:28:03] being many are one body in Christ and
[1:28:06] every one members of one another or of
[1:28:10] another that is so we are so fitted to
[1:28:14] be mutually dependent on each other this
[1:28:17] is why Satan wants to divide us I hate
[1:28:20] to say it but he's had a great success
[1:28:22] since the church started two thousand
[1:28:24] years ago and being able to divide
[1:28:26] people it didn't take long at all just
[1:28:29] some 30 years after the church is found
[1:28:31] in the book of Acts then when they come
[1:28:32] to the book of Jude and Jude was writing
[1:28:35] to the Saints and telling them to
[1:28:36] Earnest they contend for the faith that
[1:28:38] was once delivered to the Saints so Jude
[1:28:41] was written in 66 A.D so the Holy Ghost
[1:28:44] fell on the day of Pentecost about 33
[1:28:46] and a half uh somewhere almost 33 and
[1:28:48] 34. so about 33 years after the Holy
[1:28:52] Ghost has just fell and they had already
[1:28:54] started getting away from the original
[1:28:57] Faith well what happened they had people
[1:28:59] coming again that apparently was telling
[1:29:01] them we know the Nickelodeon Spirit the
[1:29:03] prophet said wasn't just the preachers
[1:29:05] but it was the people that no longer
[1:29:07] wanted the shouting speaking in tongues
[1:29:09] the worship and the praise and God is
[1:29:11] that what he said
[1:29:12] so they begin to settle for something
[1:29:15] much less and there was another church
[1:29:17] that was in the making and it was a
[1:29:20] carnal Bunch that did not have the same
[1:29:22] experience but now watch what he said
[1:29:24] that God places Us in the body then
[1:29:27] there's usefulness out of each member
[1:29:30] now remember God does not ask you what
[1:29:33] you want to be God did not say all right
[1:29:35] now everybody that wants to sing raise
[1:29:37] your hand all right all right singers
[1:29:39] singers singers singers who wants to be
[1:29:41] bass who wants to be baritone who wants
[1:29:43] to be tender who wants to be second
[1:29:44] tender who wants to play the violin who
[1:29:47] wants to play the trombone who wants to
[1:29:49] play the drums who don't want to play
[1:29:51] nothing
[1:29:52] most of them
[1:29:54] well God don't do it that way it did
[1:29:57] amazing that gifts and talents will even
[1:29:59] run in certain families and there's some
[1:30:02] families they didn't say much they got
[1:30:04] nothing I mean they can't even carry a
[1:30:06] straight turn packing a radio around but
[1:30:08] they love the same I mean it yeah they
[1:30:10] love to sing but they can't carry it too
[1:30:12] so you know what they can still obey the
[1:30:15] scripture because they're making a
[1:30:16] Joyful Noise
[1:30:18] they're making a Joyful Noise it might
[1:30:20] not be on Pitch but they're making a
[1:30:22] noise and Buddy they're happy that they
[1:30:24] can make it so praise the lord well let
[1:30:25] them sing now they may not be the same
[1:30:28] lead a song leader they might not may
[1:30:30] not be a song leader to get in front of
[1:30:31] everybody but we'll try our best to let
[1:30:34] him sin and we'll put them so far back
[1:30:35] and we'll cover them up and phone
[1:30:37] wherever if we have to the light of them
[1:30:39] sing with all their hearts because
[1:30:40] they've got a song inside of there and
[1:30:42] they want to Belt her out
[1:30:44] well praise the Lord my brother Donald
[1:30:46] are not on Pitch are not in harmony well
[1:30:49] that's just little let a little bit of
[1:30:51] Harmony go because it's such a blessing
[1:30:52] to them to do it so let them sing
[1:30:54] apparent everybody in their soft key
[1:30:56] except for them well these that's the
[1:30:57] way they think about it
[1:30:59] now once in Romans 12 6 having the gifts
[1:31:03] differing according
[1:31:06] oh my goodness to the grace
[1:31:09] that has given us I thought we finished
[1:31:11] up Grace once we got saved
[1:31:14] do you realize gifts
[1:31:16] come by the administration of Grace
[1:31:21] now what is Grace Divine favor that
[1:31:25] crisis that which you're not worthy of
[1:31:28] the something given to you when we were
[1:31:30] lost God gave us Grace so what are gifts
[1:31:34] they another allocations of the same
[1:31:38] Grace that saved you
[1:31:40] so then tell me if God gifted me in a
[1:31:44] certain way brother down in another way
[1:31:46] brother Harvey in another way you other
[1:31:48] Saints all different Saints around the
[1:31:50] world then what do I have to be arrogant
[1:31:54] about
[1:31:56] since Grace gave me the gifts I have
[1:32:02] Grace gave you by the Rob the ability
[1:32:05] the gifts for the gym brother Harry my
[1:32:08] goodness we have some great talent here
[1:32:09] at our church normally some great
[1:32:11] singers great musicians and I we so
[1:32:14] appreciate with all of our heart but
[1:32:16] none of them brother nor them sisters
[1:32:18] have a right to stand up and say do you
[1:32:20] all know how blessed you are to have me
[1:32:22] here do you all know how blessed you are
[1:32:24] that I'm here to pray for you all don't
[1:32:27] you all just want to give me a standing
[1:32:29] ovation and just say how wonderful I am
[1:32:32] and you all know how wonderful I am I am
[1:32:35] a hammer ham we're not interested in you
[1:32:37] I am or interested in here
[1:32:39] that's the grade of ham it's not you but
[1:32:42] people act like that their gifts are
[1:32:45] something they did or something that
[1:32:48] well my great desire God saw my passion
[1:32:51] God saw no no what was it your passion
[1:32:55] the Reason God saved you he saved you
[1:32:57] because you've asked him for grace and
[1:33:00] grace does not stop once we get saved
[1:33:04] Grace keeps going until the last phase
[1:33:07] of Grace you'll ever need is Rapture and
[1:33:10] Grace to change your body
[1:33:13] so it is the dispensation of Grace
[1:33:16] notice what he said now having been
[1:33:18] gifts differing according to the grace
[1:33:21] that is given to us whether prophecy let
[1:33:25] us prophesy according to the proportion
[1:33:29] of Faith now notice then so even these
[1:33:33] gifts are not determined by our ambition
[1:33:37] our personal desire well this is what I
[1:33:41] want to achieve no even your gift will
[1:33:44] work and correlate according to the
[1:33:47] proportion of faith that God gives you
[1:33:50] to operate that gift now don't look and
[1:33:54] oh don't look at your well I'm a
[1:33:57] businessman and I've done this and I've
[1:33:58] done that and I've done that and I've
[1:34:00] been able to accomplish this and that
[1:34:02] and the other and the cause I've
[1:34:04] accomplished that now that I'm serving
[1:34:06] God I will do the same thing with the
[1:34:09] economy of God that's contrary to God's
[1:34:11] word
[1:34:13] you'll never find Paul ever saying use
[1:34:16] your business this use your you know
[1:34:18] your resume out there in the world and
[1:34:21] then we'll compare it with God and God
[1:34:23] will reward you according to the amount
[1:34:25] of success you've had in the workplace
[1:34:27] well if that's so a lot of the greatest
[1:34:29] preachers that ever lived would never
[1:34:31] have nothing
[1:34:32] well the prophet tells us that Noah was
[1:34:34] a farmer and he was a man that had
[1:34:37] little to no ambition
[1:34:40] so he wasn't a great success now how
[1:34:43] many of you would want to climb on a
[1:34:45] boat built by a farmer who'd never built
[1:34:48] one before
[1:34:49] now Pastor Noah could you show us your
[1:34:52] resume I want to know what school that
[1:34:55] you come from to be able to design this
[1:34:58] boat now was this drawn on CAD did
[1:35:02] Johnson City approve of your boat I can
[1:35:05] tell you right now Johnson said he would
[1:35:07] not have approved of Noah's book
[1:35:10] we just got through dealing with them so
[1:35:12] we know how they can be no one would
[1:35:14] still be building on that boat waiting
[1:35:17] on Johnson City CEO before Noah could
[1:35:20] move in
[1:35:21] amen oh yo look at Moses could he have
[1:35:25] used his record and God said well I'll
[1:35:27] tell you what I'll I'll call you and
[1:35:29] I'll reward you according to your great
[1:35:31] success you murdered an Egyptian you run
[1:35:34] like a coward oh
[1:35:36] so people who look at their success in
[1:35:39] the natural world and then they feel you
[1:35:42] know called to do something in the
[1:35:44] gospel and they think well God will let
[1:35:45] me do the same thing two different
[1:35:47] things completely
[1:35:49] our allocation of such is company
[1:35:52] together by the dispensation of Grace
[1:35:55] also measured with a proportion of Faith
[1:35:58] let me read it again how many loves the
[1:36:00] word having them gifts differing
[1:36:03] according gifts differing according to
[1:36:06] the grace so you mean this please is God
[1:36:10] that gives would give her according to
[1:36:14] Grace
[1:36:15] why do we despise them why do we despise
[1:36:18] them why do we look down on others that
[1:36:21] maybe are less than us why are we ought
[1:36:23] to thank God
[1:36:25] notice this whether prophecy let us
[1:36:28] prophesy according to the proportion of
[1:36:32] Faith isn't this amazing now but you
[1:36:34] know me coming from a Pentecostal
[1:36:36] background of course I read the Bible
[1:36:38] whenever I spent across the preacher but
[1:36:40] I didn't understand this a bit more
[1:36:42] nothing so to look at it according to
[1:36:44] that brother thou I can never make no
[1:36:46] sense out of the scripture in Romans 12
[1:36:47] yet I read the book of Romans time and
[1:36:49] time and time again whenever I said
[1:36:50] Pentecostal preacher because I never
[1:36:52] read no other books other than the Bible
[1:36:54] so I read the Bible I quoted the Bible
[1:36:57] and I preached the Bible but I preached
[1:36:58] it blindly because I was not embracing
[1:37:01] the light of the end time but once I did
[1:37:04] you see to me the message of the hour
[1:37:06] did not come to replace the Bible but it
[1:37:09] come to open the light on the Bible and
[1:37:11] the Bible became a brand new book to me
[1:37:13] the Bible did not become a book that I
[1:37:16] just wanted to do away with well I don't
[1:37:18] need the Bible no more I love my Bible
[1:37:20] now more than I've ever loved it well
[1:37:23] praise the Lord and if you don't you
[1:37:25] better get to pray
[1:37:27] now notice then the gifts of God are
[1:37:29] given by grace and then God will use the
[1:37:33] gift according to the proportion of
[1:37:35] Faith so say a person then can be called
[1:37:38] by God to prophesy and maybe there's we
[1:37:41] know that there's a couple of ways by
[1:37:43] which this comes and it's a shame really
[1:37:45] that most people want only the vocal
[1:37:47] gifts which is inter tongues
[1:37:49] interpretation and prophecy that's the
[1:37:52] three vocal gifts of the gifts that Paul
[1:37:54] talks about in Corinthians seems nobody
[1:37:56] wants to give to wisdom and many of
[1:37:58] those others but everybody wants the
[1:37:59] gifts that are vocal why well so
[1:38:02] everybody will hear them I suppose but a
[1:38:04] person then that God might use and it
[1:38:07] might be just with a with a maybe in a
[1:38:10] prayer service and they're they're
[1:38:11] praying in the spirit of God would move
[1:38:14] upon them and they would prophesy thus
[1:38:16] saith the Lord don't go out tomorrow at
[1:38:19] a certain certain place brother Ben
[1:38:21] Davis don't go at your place of work
[1:38:23] because there will be an explosion in
[1:38:26] your main building to Mark thus saith
[1:38:28] the Lord don't goes out well if it was
[1:38:31] the word of the Lord that will happen
[1:38:33] exactly and the brother Ben believes
[1:38:36] that brother Ben will stay away from
[1:38:37] there till after the explosion takes
[1:38:39] place and then going to make an
[1:38:40] insurance claim that's right if you
[1:38:43] believe it's the word of the Lord but if
[1:38:45] not that same person say we have our
[1:38:48] dedication service and we have a
[1:38:50] thousand people sitting in this building
[1:38:52] and the spirit of God move on them and
[1:38:54] says oh Jesus oh no no no no no Lord how
[1:38:58] no no I just don't think I could do it
[1:39:00] Jesus I don't think why why the
[1:39:04] proportion of faith for their gift is
[1:39:08] not given for them to be able to stand
[1:39:10] before such a group of people you've
[1:39:11] seen prophets wanted to say what they
[1:39:14] said how could they do that how could
[1:39:16] they walk up before Kings potent takes
[1:39:19] rulers and tell them thus saith the Lord
[1:39:21] it ain't raining again though I call for
[1:39:23] it God gave them the proportion of Faith
[1:39:26] to match their gift so you see if Satan
[1:39:30] can't stop us from being gifted he'll
[1:39:32] try to mess up our perception of the
[1:39:35] proportion of Faith it's the same way
[1:39:38] with preaching same way the prophesied
[1:39:40] same way but singing now you know it is
[1:39:42] some of you that sing my I can imagine
[1:39:45] some of you that got up here the first
[1:39:46] time to sing and some of you haven't got
[1:39:49] up here yet because you're still nervous
[1:39:51] and you're trying to work up you know I
[1:39:52] can do it I can do it I can do it I
[1:39:54] think again I think again and you're
[1:39:55] still trying to psych yourself up
[1:39:57] because you thought oh my goodness I
[1:39:59] don't know if I can do it or not I don't
[1:40:00] know if I can or not or can you imagine
[1:40:02] then a person who sings in a church
[1:40:04] that's about 25 or 30 people and then
[1:40:07] walk up here oh my goodness they're
[1:40:08] froze they're just froze they can't even
[1:40:10] do it why because they're so used to
[1:40:12] standing before a certain size and the
[1:40:15] portion of faith has not been released
[1:40:17] to them to help them do it but I'm glad
[1:40:20] they're song leaders that can sing to a
[1:40:22] Congregation of more than 30. right on
[1:40:26] that we've got preachers that aren't too
[1:40:28] nervous to preach to a Congregation of
[1:40:30] more than 40 or 50. and I've told
[1:40:32] different brothers look I'd like you to
[1:40:34] come and preach oh no Brother Don I
[1:40:36] couldn't come to that big place oh Lord
[1:40:37] have mercy I'll be so I'd be so scared
[1:40:40] I'd be so nervous and you know what if
[1:40:43] they feel that way and they don't feel a
[1:40:45] release to do that I wouldn't want them
[1:40:47] to do it because they're going to be
[1:40:49] miserable and we probably will wind up
[1:40:51] being miserable with some but if they
[1:40:53] feel the release in their heart and God
[1:40:56] drops that there for them they say yes
[1:40:58] praise God I believe I can do it then
[1:41:00] they have got the proportion of faith
[1:41:02] that matches their gift you understand
[1:41:04] that said so you see God not only gives
[1:41:07] us but God gives us an allocation of
[1:41:10] Faith how could Daniel be able to face
[1:41:12] the lion still how could David be able
[1:41:15] to face the Goliath because he walked
[1:41:17] right into the anointing of that hour
[1:41:19] it's the same way with us in this end
[1:41:22] time now let's read in First Corinthians
[1:41:24] in chapter 12 verse 12. for as the body
[1:41:27] is one and has many members and all the
[1:41:31] members of that one body being many are
[1:41:35] one body so also is Christ now this is
[1:41:38] the body that Zechariah prophesied the
[1:41:41] Lord Jesus would make nothing at all
[1:41:44] locked the temple nothing at all thy
[1:41:47] parents step on nothing like the Temple
[1:41:48] of survivable nothing at all because
[1:41:51] it's going to be people all over the
[1:41:53] earth born of the same spirit of God and
[1:41:56] that Temple was in one location and one
[1:41:58] location only so God wanted to make a
[1:42:02] body where people would be so filled
[1:42:04] with his Spirit each one of them would
[1:42:07] be so diverse in what they would do and
[1:42:10] how they would function notice in verse
[1:42:13] 13 for by one Spirit are we all baptized
[1:42:18] into one body whether we be Jews or
[1:42:22] Gentile book can you imagine some of
[1:42:24] them Jewish Brothers brother Jack
[1:42:26] whenever they read this and they said
[1:42:28] Lord have mercy you mean Paul put them
[1:42:31] bunch of Gentiles right in with us why
[1:42:34] there ain't no way they they're standing
[1:42:35] there like we are you see they totally
[1:42:38] missed what the mystical body did it
[1:42:41] puts you and Gentile black white red
[1:42:44] yellow there's no difference between us
[1:42:47] amen can you imagine whenever the Jews
[1:42:50] began to really grab that Revelation and
[1:42:53] they come up to a gentile the first time
[1:42:55] and it might have been an Ephesus it
[1:42:57] might have been Smyrna who knows where
[1:42:59] it was and they had their first
[1:43:01] experience in going to a true Apostolic
[1:43:04] church and they come and those Gentiles
[1:43:06] they were slaves there was people of all
[1:43:09] colors there was people of all cultural
[1:43:12] backgrounds and ethnicity and here comes
[1:43:15] some of these Jews which would never
[1:43:16] even touch a gentile for them to touch a
[1:43:20] gentile they were unclean for hours for
[1:43:23] them to even get around you and for them
[1:43:26] to realize what God had done it must
[1:43:29] have been a powerful Revelation for them
[1:43:32] to be able to look over and then grab a
[1:43:34] hold of the Gentile Brothers hand and
[1:43:37] first of all they felt kind of funny
[1:43:38] about it oh Lord would I become unclean
[1:43:41] is this right for me to do that and that
[1:43:44] shake their hand and all of a sudden
[1:43:45] they felt that Unity that between the
[1:43:48] Jew and a gentile the Torah could not
[1:43:51] produce that Moses could not produce
[1:43:53] that the law could not produce that but
[1:43:56] the man whose name is the Braves could
[1:43:59] oh praise the Lord you don't understand
[1:44:01] why the grace of God then helps us to
[1:44:04] cross all types of racial barriers
[1:44:07] people that have racial problems I'm
[1:44:10] convinced need the Holy Ghost a white
[1:44:13] man that cannot hug a black man's neck
[1:44:16] needs the Holy Ghost and vice versa a
[1:44:19] black woman that can't hug a white
[1:44:21] sister a vice versa there's something
[1:44:23] wrong with you sis well come on preach
[1:44:25] brother Donnie because you realize
[1:44:27] you're baptized by the Holy Ghost into
[1:44:30] the same body and there's only one
[1:44:33] Superior race and that is the new race
[1:44:36] and in the new race are black white red
[1:44:40] yellow they are of all types of cultural
[1:44:43] backgrounds they're all type of
[1:44:45] eccentricity but there's one thing they
[1:44:47] have in common the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:44:51] Ghost so in there all their differences
[1:44:54] become as nothing
[1:44:57] hmm
[1:44:59] notice in verse 14 for the body
[1:45:02] is not one member
[1:45:04] but many
[1:45:06] verse 18.
[1:45:08] but now hath God listen to this
[1:45:11] construction terms now
[1:45:14] now hath God
[1:45:17] said
[1:45:18] the members
[1:45:21] who said them
[1:45:23] who talk to me
[1:45:25] God
[1:45:26] so you didn't get to choose
[1:45:28] I didn't get to choose Mama didn't get
[1:45:31] to choose for you
[1:45:33] God set the members listen now every one
[1:45:38] of them in the body
[1:45:41] I said please the members
[1:45:47] you see what we're doing friends
[1:45:49] whenever we kick against what God has
[1:45:51] given us
[1:45:53] we're kicking against God's Own pleasure
[1:45:58] I hope you understand generally
[1:45:59] depending on which side you are I've
[1:46:02] never been a type of person that want to
[1:46:04] be nothing okay
[1:46:06] I could sit down right here tonight I've
[1:46:08] been thinking as hard as I've been
[1:46:10] working the last couple years about
[1:46:12] taking a sabbatical
[1:46:14] maybe about I'm thinking seven eight
[1:46:16] years I might get caught up rested
[1:46:19] I thought we'd have a vote on it tonight
[1:46:21] me and Carol's on the ones vote
[1:46:24] y'all's vote don't encounter now
[1:46:28] so I'm the type of person that I don't
[1:46:31] want to do anything I don't want to be
[1:46:33] up in front of people I know it sounds
[1:46:34] crazy to you I don't want my picture
[1:46:37] taken
[1:46:38] I don't like to be on video
[1:46:41] I don't want you to be in front of a big
[1:46:43] crowd
[1:46:45] some of you have told me brother don't
[1:46:46] you I like a small Church any of you
[1:46:48] just told me that know me I'll tell you
[1:46:50] about so do I
[1:46:52] I'm what am I supposed to do around
[1:46:54] everybody else off except me and you
[1:46:56] now you see God does not set us in the
[1:47:00] way that pleases us
[1:47:03] he doesn't even ask us are you okay with
[1:47:06] this Arrangement are you fine with this
[1:47:08] for the doubt are you okay with that are
[1:47:10] you fine my children are you all okay
[1:47:12] with it I thought I'd run it by you
[1:47:14] before I did it he didn't even ask us is
[1:47:16] that right so he just does it and then
[1:47:19] he gives us and calls us and places it
[1:47:22] where and according to what purpose and
[1:47:25] design as it pleases him so if every one
[1:47:30] of us can find that for those of us who
[1:47:33] would want to be more than what we're
[1:47:35] called to be and for those of us and
[1:47:38] I'll say I'm guilty who would love
[1:47:41] absolutely love to be less
[1:47:46] y'all ever notice me when I'm out in
[1:47:48] meetings and I'm not preaching
[1:47:49] you notice where I sat
[1:47:52] that beautiful woman right there
[1:47:54] my wife
[1:47:55] preacher said but I come up on the
[1:47:57] pulpit and I'll tell them I don't watch
[1:47:59] me on the camera
[1:48:01] you say that's crazy I know and that's
[1:48:04] why you belong to this church you're as
[1:48:05] crazy as I am
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:10] I don't like to live just to call me up
[1:48:12] to sing I'd blow all the pieces worse
[1:48:14] than preaching just to call me up to
[1:48:16] pray over the prayer request I'd rather
[1:48:17] just be the guy behind the scenes just
[1:48:19] out of the way I I I I don't like any of
[1:48:22] that and yet God call me to preach you
[1:48:25] think he ain't got a sense of humor
[1:48:27] my favorite clothes is a pair of jeans
[1:48:30] on and a henley shirt or a t-shirt
[1:48:32] something like that I hate a suit I hate
[1:48:36] dressing up I hate wearing a three-piece
[1:48:39] a two-piece I hate it I hate neckties
[1:48:47] okay what
[1:48:51] but you know what God didn't ask me but
[1:48:54] I'm not going to step out here like one
[1:48:56] of them modern preachers with my shirt
[1:48:58] tail all stuck out I'd hop on a pair of
[1:49:00] ball shoes and look like a beatnik that
[1:49:02] comes with my position and this is the
[1:49:05] way I'm on a dress and then cause I like
[1:49:08] it is because it requires it but I want
[1:49:11] to please him how many wants to please
[1:49:14] him even if he makes you do something
[1:49:17] you don't want to do if he makes you
[1:49:20] less then what you think you are are you
[1:49:23] okay with that if he makes you more than
[1:49:26] what you see you are are you okay with
[1:49:29] that
[1:49:32] oh some of you didn't say Amen on that
[1:49:34] part
[1:49:36] you see according to his pleasure
[1:49:40] it makes it fit in the economy of God
[1:49:45] wow
[1:49:47] but you know what Satan loves to do he
[1:49:49] loves to get in now manipulate that
[1:49:52] and confuse people on the way they look
[1:49:55] at them
[1:49:56] now some preachers
[1:49:58] they're only ever now and then speakers
[1:50:01] to preach a convention
[1:50:04] to preach four or five times a week
[1:50:07] they couldn't do it save the life
[1:50:10] their capacity just isn't there
[1:50:13] does that mean they're not called of God
[1:50:14] it does not
[1:50:16] it means they've not gone into it yet or
[1:50:19] they may never be convinced and precious
[1:50:23] but I dare say shame on any of us that
[1:50:25] would look down on them because they're
[1:50:26] not
[1:50:27] they're just as important in the economy
[1:50:30] of God as the best convention preacher
[1:50:32] that ever preached
[1:50:39] you see it's not our say it's not our
[1:50:42] position
[1:50:43] to say who can or cannot notice this in
[1:50:46] First Corinthians 12 19 it will close
[1:50:48] and if they were all one member well
[1:50:52] worth the body
[1:50:53] but now I'll say many members
[1:50:56] but yet one body now there was a problem
[1:51:01] we know in the church at Corinth and the
[1:51:04] spirit of God took this opportunity with
[1:51:07] the issues that were in the churches I'd
[1:51:09] like to take each one of those churches
[1:51:11] sometime and then bring it out to you
[1:51:13] but in the Corinthian Church that was
[1:51:16] there was lots of issues there was
[1:51:18] adultery
[1:51:20] there was gift problems no it's all
[1:51:23] types of problems but when we look at
[1:51:26] the church of corens from the time the
[1:51:28] first book of Corinthians was written
[1:51:30] time the second one was written which is
[1:51:32] about five years later we can see a lot
[1:51:35] of maturity and a lot of growth in that
[1:51:37] church I love seeing that myself I love
[1:51:40] comparing the First Corinthians to the
[1:51:42] second because you can see even with the
[1:51:45] Brethren that was called uh living with
[1:51:47] his stepmother and we can see how that
[1:51:49] that brother got corrected by the spirit
[1:51:52] of God and see how that Paul dealt with
[1:51:55] him and how the man had got changed and
[1:51:57] straightened out that issue in his life
[1:51:59] and we can see by the time we come to
[1:52:01] Second Corinthians the gift problem many
[1:52:04] of those problems had subsided because
[1:52:06] they had grown and matured but they were
[1:52:09] trying apparently they had an idea
[1:52:12] before them and they want everybody to
[1:52:14] be one particular member so they wanted
[1:52:16] everybody to be a hand
[1:52:24] I love my hand
[1:52:25] well sort it
[1:52:27] what would I do without them
[1:52:31] but also appreciate my heart
[1:52:33] I appreciate my lungs
[1:52:35] my liver my kidneys I ain't never seen
[1:52:39] them but I've told I've got one
[1:52:41] I've seen X-rays and stuff how many has
[1:52:43] ever seen your kidney
[1:52:44] oh you believe you've got one let me
[1:52:47] sing your lungs or about your brain
[1:52:49] because everyone I don't say I'm not
[1:52:50] sure if I have one or not
[1:52:53] but yet those things which are unseen
[1:52:56] are they important how does my hands
[1:52:59] just go up what was it that signaled my
[1:53:01] hands to go up oh your hands wanted to
[1:53:03] no my hands do not have the intelligence
[1:53:06] to raise on their own but God so
[1:53:09] designed my body and tied every bit of
[1:53:11] my spinal cord and all my nerves up to
[1:53:14] the command center which is in my brain
[1:53:16] and there it sets and most of us only
[1:53:18] use a very very small portion of it but
[1:53:20] from there it controls all these
[1:53:22] movements all these different things how
[1:53:24] grateful I am oh no wonder David said we
[1:53:27] are so fearfully and wonderful day that
[1:53:29] we can lay down now think of it how much
[1:53:31] God committed in your body to that which
[1:53:34] even the subconscious would control
[1:53:35] think of it if God had not put the
[1:53:38] controls of your body your respiration
[1:53:40] your blood pressure your heartbeat all
[1:53:42] those things to when you would go to
[1:53:44] sleep if God had placed all that in the
[1:53:46] element of the first conscience if you
[1:53:48] everyone sleep you died of a heart
[1:53:49] attack but what did God do God committed
[1:53:52] many of those things even to the realm
[1:53:54] of the subconscious and you can go into
[1:53:57] a deep sleep inspirational slow down and
[1:53:59] you enter the fourth cycle of course of
[1:54:01] the brain waves and that's when you're
[1:54:02] resting the most deep and yet you're not
[1:54:04] even conscious that you're breathing but
[1:54:06] you are in and out in and out your
[1:54:08] heart's beating back and forth is that
[1:54:10] right why it's that inside of you that
[1:54:13] we take for granted every time we lay
[1:54:15] down y'all ever thank God for that I'm
[1:54:17] thinking about the other day I know you
[1:54:19] think I'm weird but I was thinking about
[1:54:20] the other day and I got to thinking
[1:54:22] about my heart and I just got to
[1:54:24] thinking you know as loud as that heart
[1:54:25] is wouldn't it been annoying if God
[1:54:28] would have made that thing loud I mean
[1:54:30] every time it's such a boom boom boom I
[1:54:32] thought who but God who but God could
[1:54:35] put his pumping valve inside of our
[1:54:38] bodies and yet very it's not really that
[1:54:41] deep it's not really that far in but
[1:54:43] insulated so much that a doctor would
[1:54:46] have to lay his head over on your chest
[1:54:48] or get a stethoscope to be able to hear
[1:54:50] it and yet it's there bumping all the
[1:54:53] time pumping pumping pumping and God
[1:54:55] knew exactly the element of decibel let
[1:54:57] level to be able to set that heart I
[1:55:00] thought how an amazing thing and how in
[1:55:02] the world could that have happened by me
[1:55:03] coming out of a green pond scum and
[1:55:06] evolving out of that into this no sir it
[1:55:09] was my father that did such a thing and
[1:55:12] if he'd done that to the Natural Body
[1:55:13] how much more has he done to the
[1:55:16] spiritual body and the church said
[1:55:18] and I said let's stand
[1:55:33] look at verse 24.
[1:55:35] for our calmly parts
[1:55:38] have no need but God has tempered the
[1:55:41] body together
[1:55:43] having given more abundant honor
[1:55:47] to that part
[1:55:48] which is life so God assigns Christians
[1:55:52] to their talents and opportunities and
[1:55:56] even allocates their measure of
[1:55:59] influence
[1:56:01] in that position
[1:56:03] now you realize maybe some of you look
[1:56:06] at some of these musicians and singers
[1:56:08] and song leaders and whatever ones that
[1:56:10] oh my goodness I wish I could do that
[1:56:12] but I hope you also understand that when
[1:56:15] the more God gifts you it's like the
[1:56:18] bigger the target is on your back
[1:56:21] Satan is out to get you
[1:56:24] because your gift blesses so many people
[1:56:27] and helped so many people and when Satan
[1:56:31] sees it it's like it goes from here of
[1:56:33] being just a lay member that loves God
[1:56:35] goes to church does everything you can
[1:56:38] do and God gives you more and more and
[1:56:41] more and more and the bigger the target
[1:56:43] is on your back
[1:56:45] why you're a blessing to others
[1:56:48] you're a help to others that's why you
[1:56:51] should pray for the preachers pray for
[1:56:53] the deacons the trustees Sunday school
[1:56:56] teachers praise the Lord don't just pray
[1:56:58] for the preachers of our church we
[1:57:00] should be praying for the ministry
[1:57:02] around the world do you realize Satan
[1:57:05] hates them more than ever before and
[1:57:08] he's out after him why because they are
[1:57:11] such a blessing to God's people
[1:57:14] and they're such a help and God
[1:57:17] allocates to them a measure of influence
[1:57:21] you think it don't scare me when I stand
[1:57:24] up here or down at brother Jason's or
[1:57:26] the youth camp in Louisiana or the youth
[1:57:28] camp in South Carolina Lord willing this
[1:57:30] year and the different places around the
[1:57:33] world that I'm scheduled to be you think
[1:57:35] it don't scare me to death to think of
[1:57:38] the influence that God's given me around
[1:57:39] the world for decades
[1:57:41] and you wonder why I wish I was less
[1:57:44] if I had to answer for this congregation
[1:57:47] signs alone
[1:57:48] it'd be something what's one Soul worse
[1:57:51] but the influence that God's given us
[1:57:54] around the world the Lord help us
[1:57:57] help us
[1:57:58] it makes you fearful because you realize
[1:58:02] Satan is after you and if he can't get
[1:58:05] you with women can't get you with money
[1:58:07] can't get you with popularity he'll try
[1:58:11] to worry out
[1:58:12] try to make you so exhausted
[1:58:15] it wasn't women that nearly got brother
[1:58:17] Branham it was not money it was not
[1:58:20] popularity what was it burnout
[1:58:23] just burn out he went and went and gave
[1:58:27] and gave so he just felt like he
[1:58:30] couldn't give no more imagine coming to
[1:58:33] himself on his way back from Arkansas
[1:58:35] his truck went off the road and he had
[1:58:38] his hands laid on a cow's head
[1:58:41] praying for that cow thought it was a
[1:58:43] woman in the prayer line
[1:58:45] had to come off the field brother Donnie
[1:58:47] for about a year
[1:58:48] and he said does God do that to a man
[1:58:50] man does that to himself
[1:58:54] but he loved the people so much and he
[1:58:57] felt for the people so much
[1:58:59] Satan couldn't stop him with the women
[1:59:01] so what'd he do just kept pulling him
[1:59:03] taxing him taking out more more more
[1:59:05] more more more and then it had to come
[1:59:09] off the field for a year
[1:59:11] to recuperate
[1:59:15] help us Jesus
[1:59:17] help us Jesus
[1:59:20] how many loves him with all your heart
[1:59:22] you want to be what God's called you to
[1:59:24] be
[1:59:25] brother Donnie I don't need the people
[1:59:27] of the church now out there you just
[1:59:28] told a bald-faced lie
[1:59:30] if God sets you here at our assembly I
[1:59:32] don't care where else you'll go you'll
[1:59:34] never be happy if this is where you're
[1:59:35] supposed to be and if you ain't supposed
[1:59:37] to be here you'll never be happy staying
[1:59:39] here you need to find wherever it is God
[1:59:40] wants you
[1:59:42] right
[1:59:44] but when we do then we do everything we
[1:59:47] can to work together with that body to
[1:59:50] make it what God wants it to be
[1:59:53] not Donnie Reagan's church this that the
[1:59:56] other the body of Christ
[1:59:59] I mean lots of people remembered tonight
[2:00:00] as we pray
[2:00:01] God bless you let's just bow our heads
[2:00:03] together
[2:00:07] o Heavenly Father
[2:00:11] it's a fearful thing
[2:00:15] to be gifted by you
[2:00:18] it's a fearful thing to be entrusted
[2:00:21] by you was influence upon people
[2:00:25] how many times have I said in my
[2:00:27] studying try to talk to people and as I
[2:00:31] begin to talk to them about this or that
[2:00:33] or the other whatever it is
[2:00:35] I realize as I move into that channel of
[2:00:38] the spirit of God
[2:00:39] and I realized that I've entered into a
[2:00:43] sacred yet dangerous place
[2:00:46] because they have opened their life to
[2:00:49] me
[2:00:50] as a pastor
[2:00:52] while I have them there for five minutes
[2:00:54] 10 or 15 or 30. I can be able to input
[2:00:58] things that will change their life
[2:01:01] Lord God help me that it'll always be
[2:01:03] for the good
[2:01:05] help every Minister your father that we
[2:01:08] will never have our own agenda
[2:01:11] that will never be competition
[2:01:15] oh Lord but it'll be for one purpose
[2:01:17] that is the economy of God
[2:01:21] we don't want this church to be
[2:01:23] necessarily my church
[2:01:26] we don't want it to be built in honor of
[2:01:29] this man or that man
[2:01:31] but in the honor and Glory of Jesus
[2:01:35] Christ
[2:01:37] people being saved filled with the Holy
[2:01:39] Ghost healed
[2:01:41] not to the credit of the pastor but to
[2:01:45] the credit of the Lord Jesus
[2:01:48] father May each member realize tonight
[2:01:51] each one of us have been given something
[2:01:54] to do
[2:01:55] and if we fail our post
[2:02:00] it's not just a simple well I don't like
[2:02:03] the new building I'm leaving and going
[2:02:05] somewhere else
[2:02:08] you never even ask us that
[2:02:10] you never asked us if we wanted to go to
[2:02:13] this church or that church or another
[2:02:14] church
[2:02:15] I pray it'd help people to see what a
[2:02:17] dangerous thing it is when they just
[2:02:20] decide they're going to do this and that
[2:02:21] and the other
[2:02:23] help us to realize we are the body
[2:02:25] father
[2:02:26] and we need one another
[2:02:29] to function properly
[2:02:32] help us Lord Jesus
[2:02:35] how many years saying sure tonight say
[2:02:37] Lord remember me
[2:02:39] just raise your hand to him
[2:02:41] men women boys girls
[2:02:45] I've never been given that much I doubt
[2:02:48] that
[2:02:49] if you're in the body God has given you
[2:02:51] something sisters you may say well I
[2:02:54] don't ever preach I can't sing no you
[2:02:56] may not but it may be your life it may
[2:02:59] be your dress it may be your influence
[2:03:01] the way you live around others and what
[2:03:05] an influence that can be
[2:03:07] but God is given to each of us something
[2:03:10] gifts by grace that we can help others
[2:03:15] oh father would you mind laying your
[2:03:18] hand over other person standing by you
[2:03:19] let's just offer a word of Prayer
[2:03:24] heavenly father as we
[2:03:27] have our hands won upon the other
[2:03:28] tonight Lord
[2:03:30] we're just praying that should help us
[2:03:33] men women young people
[2:03:37] dear God In The Name of Jesus may we
[2:03:40] find Our Place
[2:03:43] for many of them they have
[2:03:45] but yet Lord we know that you change us
[2:03:48] from time to time and we move up
[2:03:51] I personally think this that we have
[2:03:54] built here is a change
[2:03:57] I believe with all of my heart oh I know
[2:04:00] some of them didn't want it some of them
[2:04:01] didn't like it some of them got mad at
[2:04:02] me because of it but they'll look back
[2:04:05] and realize it was the Lord
[2:04:06] I'll give them Mercy We Believe father
[2:04:10] that our life
[2:04:11] is placed on the earth to serve you
[2:04:15] I'm not here to please myself
[2:04:18] I'm not here to please these people
[2:04:21] I'm here to please you
[2:04:23] and if I please you
[2:04:25] I will please those among these people
[2:04:27] who also please you
[2:04:30] so if we please you we will please you
[2:04:34] together
[2:04:35] and that's what we desire father
[2:04:37] Lord we're not looking for a great
[2:04:40] number we're not looking for a big
[2:04:42] following we're just looking for
[2:04:44] everyone that you've ordained to
[2:04:46] Fellowship here with us
[2:04:48] how many ever that is
[2:04:50] we want to help we want to reach out
[2:04:53] many of them think what could I do I'm
[2:04:55] only a woman well maybe they could go
[2:04:58] visit some of these with us
[2:05:00] go to a nursing home go to a shut-in of
[2:05:03] some of our sisters just let them know
[2:05:05] they love them some of our young men
[2:05:07] want to know what they can do or they
[2:05:09] want to grab an iPad and jump in the
[2:05:11] pulpit
[2:05:13] but you never sent them out like that
[2:05:15] but you told him to begin at Jerusalem
[2:05:17] start right there at home start but they
[2:05:20] wasn't respected
[2:05:22] I've seen it many times in some of the
[2:05:24] young preachers they want to preach to
[2:05:25] the Sunday crowd and I'll ask him to
[2:05:27] preach to the young people and they
[2:05:28] don't want to that tells me right there
[2:05:30] there's something wrong with her call
[2:05:33] a man that's really called of God will
[2:05:36] preach to one if he has to he'll start
[2:05:38] at the very bottom oh it's much easier
[2:05:41] to want a man's position who's been
[2:05:43] laboring for decades and stepped there
[2:05:46] in a position that's been built through
[2:05:48] all the hardships and the trials but
[2:05:51] Lord God
[2:05:52] if you want me to preach to one I'll
[2:05:55] preach to one
[2:05:56] Lord God if you go of God anything you
[2:05:58] want me to do
[2:06:00] Jesus I don't care if it's little or
[2:06:02] small
[2:06:03] I don't care if it's redundant I don't
[2:06:05] care Lord if people never even know
[2:06:07] nothing about it
[2:06:09] I'll go Jesus
[2:06:11] I've tried to stay away from some of the
[2:06:13] countries around the world where a lot
[2:06:15] of the preachers go and the brothers are
[2:06:18] wondering why I won't come and I've told
[2:06:19] them look y'all have blisters from
[2:06:21] everywhere I'd rather go to those places
[2:06:23] than a lot of people don't go
[2:06:25] where nobody goes and visits them
[2:06:27] oh Jesus there's a work for us all help
[2:06:31] us father
[2:06:33] help us to find our place
[2:06:35] May Grace minister to us the portion of
[2:06:39] faith
[2:06:40] granted I pray Lord God
[2:06:42] we love you tonight Jesus
[2:06:45] we love you Lord
[2:06:47] can we just raise our hands
[2:06:50] in the presence of the one who hands out
[2:06:53] these gifts
[2:06:56] but whether or not you understand this
[2:06:58] whenever you were born into this world
[2:07:01] you have every gift in you that you will
[2:07:04] ever use
[2:07:05] for the kingdom of God
[2:07:07] they're in you then
[2:07:10] they may come to different years and
[2:07:12] they'll finally manifest themselves but
[2:07:15] everything you'll ever need is in you so
[2:07:19] when you see people trying to be beyond
[2:07:22] their god-given ability you know right
[2:07:24] there something is wrong do they love
[2:07:27] the Lord's sure they may love the Lord
[2:07:28] but they're confused they simply don't
[2:07:32] understand a man who feels his call to
[2:07:34] preach and never can preach years after
[2:07:37] years after years they never can preach
[2:07:39] there's something wrong somewhere if God
[2:07:41] calls a man to preach it gives them the
[2:07:43] ability to stand up and preach that's
[2:07:45] just the way God works
[2:07:48] oh my
[2:07:49] no wonder the prophet said it this is
[2:07:52] not word but word but
[2:07:54] he said how much time would save
[2:07:55] ourselves in God if we go to him who
[2:07:59] brought us
[2:08:01] on the earth and say Lord what am I here
[2:08:04] for
[2:08:06] help me to find
[2:08:08] what am I here for
[2:08:10] praise the Lord
[2:08:13] praise the Lord what about it young
[2:08:15] people you young men
[2:08:18] you know what you're here for
[2:08:20] you young sisters you know what you're
[2:08:22] here for
[2:08:23] your brother's in your 30s 40s what
[2:08:25] about it brothers sisters we know what
[2:08:28] we're here for
[2:08:30] let's find it let's be faithful or some
[2:08:32] of you older people say brother Donnie
[2:08:34] I'm in my 70s now I can't do no more I
[2:08:37] can't no no what you've done is simply
[2:08:40] changed a dispensation now you've moved
[2:08:43] into this realm of being an elder Among
[2:08:47] Us
[2:08:48] so be faithful be there for these young
[2:08:51] people to say there's a brother there's
[2:08:54] a sister that's like a rock look at them
[2:08:57] they stood through they stood faithful
[2:08:59] oh man I don't say that much you don't
[2:09:01] have to your age your faithfulness your
[2:09:05] faithfulness to Christ your faithfulness
[2:09:07] to the church to the word and you're not
[2:09:09] ready to even saying anything but just
[2:09:12] being there and going right on to the
[2:09:14] end you know Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
[2:09:17] all of them became that in their life
[2:09:19] they were still alive when the light had
[2:09:21] changed to their sons and their
[2:09:23] grandsons Abraham was still alive by the
[2:09:26] time the glory of God had moved to
[2:09:28] dispensations Abraham was still alive
[2:09:31] and not one more word is mentioned about
[2:09:33] him until he dies so what was he doing
[2:09:36] brother JD he was fulfilling the part of
[2:09:39] being stable being an elder to the tribe
[2:09:42] no doubt they'd come and talk to him and
[2:09:44] they'd say oh my look at him that old
[2:09:47] patriarch and it set them shake with his
[2:09:49] hands but he was a patriarch right down
[2:09:51] to the very end there's something for
[2:09:53] all of us don't think what I'm too old
[2:09:55] no you're not too old some of you
[2:09:58] Brothers just say brother Donnie I I
[2:10:01] don't know if I'll be any good or not

[2:11:05] that there should be no schism
[2:11:09] in the body
[2:11:11] that the members should have the same
[2:11:13] care and Schism is division or rent
[2:11:20] something rent tore from the body a
[2:11:25] division
[2:11:26] A dissension what causes this when
[2:11:30] people get out of their place and
[2:11:32] someone thinks they're called to do this
[2:11:34] or that or the other and they're not
[2:11:36] so what do they Cause A dissension a
[2:11:39] rent a tear in the body they don't have
