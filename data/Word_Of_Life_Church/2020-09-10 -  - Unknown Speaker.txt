TRANSCRIPT
========================================
look friend there's wonderful things that's happening among us but there's all kinds of bad things happening among us as well how do you figure anybody in our church that's going to be healed if we all stay perfectly healthy how do you figure we're going to see any miracles the lord gave me a sermon title whenever i was during this time of covet woke me up about 3 000 3 in the morning something like that 3 30. and i heard him say these words very peculiar and was not speaking to me personally now but it was a sermon title can i borrow your body for a miracle he did yours and i laid their brother down and i thought my goodness can i borrow your body and i laid there and prayed and thought it through i wanted to make sure he wasn't talking to me personally the lord says mean i'm getting worse you know and then i realized as the inspiration to begin to break on he was not not speaking to me personally but he was speaking to me a sermon title and i thought what a phenomenal thing that if god were to ask you can i borrow your body and i thought about the man there whenever the disciples said lord who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind jesus said neither one but that the glory of god what did he want to do he wanted to borrow his body to display a miracle oh hallelujah or children if we could only look at it that way when sickness comes our way when trouble comes over and say lord you want to borrow my body for a divine healing you want to borrow my body oh god so i can stand up and give testimony the doctor said this wouldn't happen and that wouldn't happen but god borrowed my body and let omnipotence manifest itself through me and what god oh hallelujah what god himself said i will do the doctor said it's impossible faith does not make things easy faith makes them possible let me say it again faith does not make things easy faith makes things possible [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah can you imagine in a sense the lord jesus could have said of the two in the field of the two women grinding he could have said to the one can i borrow your body for a miracle i believe there's people sitting right here in this place tonight that will have that very thing to happen to you the lord jesus will borrow your body for a miracle but it won't be a divine healing it will be a change forever
