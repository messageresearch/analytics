[41:17] have church tonight didn't we did I'm so
[41:20] grateful that the Lord is U so mindful
[41:22] of us and helping us to be able to live
[41:25] in this Evil dark dark time that we're
[41:29] living in but it's a paradox in the age
[41:32] that we are the prophet tells us it's
[41:35] the greatest of all ages and yet the
[41:38] darkest of all the ages that's ever been
[41:41] so I'm grateful that God has given us
[41:42] light that we'd be able to walk by can
[41:45] you imagine where you'd be tonight if it
[41:47] wasn't for the grace and the mercy of
[41:50] God some of you might be out running
[41:52] around drinking you might be doping you
[41:54] might be who knows where you in the
[41:56] world you'd be but God in his Mercy has
[41:59] shined upon us and given us Grace let's
[42:03] turn if you would tonight to the Book of
[42:05] Genesis certainly appreciate the
[42:08] presence of the Lord and knowing that
[42:10] he's so um so mindful of us and
[42:13] believing that he's going to come once
[42:15] again I don't know about you but uh we
[42:18] just had church here Sunday but here it
[42:20] is Wednesday and I need him again yeah
[42:24] amen oh as a matter of fact I needed him

[42:36] know me well enough to know I'll need
[42:39] him again tomorrow and Friday and
[42:41] Saturday and so on and so on and so on
[42:45] but to me the way I look at that that
[42:47] does that does not humble me as far as
[42:50] the world is concerned all that religion
[42:52] thing that's just that's just the people
[42:53] that aren't educated that's just the
[42:56] people that use that for an excuse no
[42:58] I'm not using it for an excuse I'm using
[43:00] it for a way out of this mess
[43:02] where because it's the only way that
[43:06] there is out how many knows that's the
[43:09] truth I'll tell you the darkness that's
[43:11] around us every day friends I I just
[43:13] don't know I don't know how in the world
[43:15] that people live and make it every day

[43:31] them I'll quit then we'll do something
[43:33] else but I've got um I've still got
[43:36] several um questions that people have
[43:39] given me so I want to deal with them

[43:55] studying them to be honest with you and
[43:57] it's been a it's been a blessing to me
[43:59] God bless you let's turn to uh Genesis
[44:02] want to read a little bit about the and
[44:04] Del Lu instruction here my my computer
[44:07] is um kind of acting up on me my iPad
[44:10] rather but that's all right I've got one
[44:13] another one in the back and I've also
[44:15] got it on my phone so don't get nervous
[44:20] okay God bless you let's turn there to
[44:23] Genesis chap 6 verse 5
[44:28] I want to speak to you tonight on the
[44:30] spirit of the last
[44:33] days the
[44:34] spirit of the last
[44:37] days Genesis 6 verse 5 now listen
[44:41] carefully as we read this because it's
[44:43] a it was an end time whenever this was
[44:47] actually written
[44:48] about now there's been many end times
[44:52] down through time so it was an end of
[44:56] this and an end of that that and an end
[44:57] of something else so this is not the
[45:00] first end time and what we're going to
[45:03] read about is an end time uh the an
[45:07] deluvian
[45:08] destruction and God saw that the
[45:10] wickedness of man was great in the
[45:13] earth and that every imagination of the
[45:16] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[45:23] continually so once you think about how
[45:25] bad that it was prior to the
[45:28] flood that man's heart was constantly on
[45:34] evil it wasn't every now and then that
[45:36] evil would come to him and they fight it
[45:38] and battle against it but constantly his
[45:42] heart was only and the thoughts of his
[45:45] Hearts was only
[45:47] evil and it repented the Lord that he
[45:51] had made man on the earth and it grieved
[45:55] him at his
[45:58] heart and the Lord said I will destroy
[46:02] man what a terrible time it must have
[46:05] been whom I have created from the face
[46:09] of the Earth both man and
[46:13] Beast and the creeping thing and the
[46:17] fowls of the air now want you notice it
[46:20] was a Dominion that God left out of this
[46:24] destruction
[46:28] man
[46:30] Beast creeping
[46:32] thing and fowls of the
[46:34] air anybody know where that Dimension
[46:37] was left out
[46:40] Waters God didn't say he destroy the
[46:42] fish no God didn't say destroy the
[46:44] inhabitants of the rivers and the lakes
[46:47] and the
[46:48] oceans but the fouls of the air of the
[46:51] beast of the field for it repenteth
[46:54] me that I have made them
[46:58] verse eight but
[47:00] Noah found
[47:03] Grace in the eyes of the
[47:06] Lord the first time this precious
[47:10] wonderful word is found in the
[47:14] Bible and Noah found Grace in the eyes
[47:20] of the Lord now let me read this to you
[47:22] from show us the father and I want you
[47:24] to listen this is preached in June the
[47:28] 10th of
[47:33] 1953 looking around at the nature of the
[47:37] people seeing that we're in the spirit
[47:40] of the last
[47:42] day they had to get in the spirit of the
[47:45] anti deluvian world
[47:49] before they could be
[47:51] destroyed now think of this so they had
[47:54] to be an anointing that would be on the
[47:56] Earth
[47:57] and the people had to get under that
[48:00] before God could ever justly
[48:04] destroy every human being but Noah in
[48:08] his family I think of it Millions times
[48:12] millions of people men women
[48:17] newborns toddlers
[48:21] pre-teens
[48:22] teenagers annihilated
[48:27] God cannot do such a thing until the
[48:30] conditions are so
[48:33] horrific that there's no way
[48:36] back now notice they had to get in the
[48:38] spirit of the and deluvian world before
[48:40] they could be destroyed they have to be
[48:43] in the spirit of
[48:44] War before they can have
[48:47] war God let us be in the spirit of
[48:51] Christ
[48:53] tonight so we can have Christ amen
[48:57] ain't that wonderful so you can't have
[48:59] War to get in the spirit of War you
[49:01] can't have a flood to get the spirit of
[49:02] and delion destruction so that's what
[49:05] the world is going to get into but let
[49:07] us get in the spirit of Christ so we can
[49:10] have what war trouble
[49:14] Christ Christ let us be in the spirit of
[49:20] repentance a spirit of Faith give it to
[49:24] us tonight Our Father
[49:27] of these great
[49:30] Treasures of
[49:32] Life how many let you be remembered as
[49:34] we
[49:36] pray Lord Jesus we love you so
[49:40] much we can look around us and see that
[49:44] the
[49:45] world is truly every day
[49:48] moving in the anointing of the end
[49:52] time I find it amazing that back in 53
[49:55] and 54 that your Prophet said that the
[49:59] people of the world was already in the
[50:04] spirit of the end time but the
[50:08] church was not in the spirit of the end
[50:10] time
[50:12] yet so the world actually got ahead of
[50:16] us
[50:18] somehow so you had to send a prophet was
[50:22] a message and send a great Dynamic power
[50:26] power that would catch the bride
[50:30] up father we pray tonight that you would
[50:33] help us
[50:34] Lord open our understanding to the day
[50:37] and the hour that we're living in open
[50:41] my mouth to the words of life shut my
[50:44] mouth to anything that would displease
[50:47] you Lord we commit the service to you
[50:49] tonight in the name of
[50:52] Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God
[50:56] bless you BL you keep your Bible there
[50:57] if you'd like to follow with me in the
[50:59] scripture into Genesis 6:
[51:05] 11 let's go on reading this now about
[51:08] this anti deluvian
[51:11] world and the Earth also was
[51:16] corrupt before God now whenever Moses is
[51:21] writing about this he's not talking
[51:24] about the planet
[51:26] the dirt had not sinned the trees the
[51:31] animals nature it had not sinned but
[51:36] since man had been given the domain of
[51:40] Earth then God attributes man and his
[51:46] inheritance in the same verse the Earth
[51:49] also was corrupt look at what the word
[51:54] means to destroy go to ruin
[51:59] Decay be
[52:02] rotted
[52:04] rotted so the Earth also was corrupt
[52:09] before God and the Earth was filled with
[52:18] Hamas
[52:21] violence now I want you to think now
[52:24] that it didn't start out this way and it
[52:28] took a long time for it to get this way
[52:34] because from the time that Noah was born
[52:39] and by the time this had arrived had
[52:42] already been quite a long time and then
[52:45] we have what was called the patriarchal
[52:49] age so it wasn't really a government it
[52:53] wasn't a government like we have today
[52:55] there were no
[52:56] presidents premieres there was no Prime
[53:00] Ministers no popes no Bishops it was of
[53:05] the patriarchal order but yet the
[53:11] Patriarchs that loved God were very
[53:15] few and the further that it went to this
[53:19] cycle here they
[53:22] became less and less and no Noah was
[53:28] born in the right time in due season a
[53:33] man that God was going to use for a
[53:37] great great purpose the Earth had
[53:41] constantly being
[53:44] deteriorated as the population grew no
[53:48] way for us to know exactly how many that
[53:51] there were on the Earth but the prophet
[53:54] tells us that there was millions of
[53:58] people so it was quite a time of
[54:04] dishonesty of Corruption of
[54:08] rottenness of
[54:10] violence and man left to his own
[54:15] devices it's just in his Fallen nature I
[54:19] think there was no
[54:21] television there was no internet there
[54:24] was no radio there was no form of
[54:28] communication the way we have today so
[54:32] the rotness had proceeded how lip to
[54:38] ear so it took some span of time for it
[54:43] to get to this place God would have been
[54:46] unjust to have brought this
[54:49] flood 200 years earlier in this time
[54:54] frame now God would will speak about it
[54:58] prophetically and let people know
[55:00] something is fixing to happen and he
[55:03] will warn and he will warn and no doubt
[55:06] the patriarchal fathers did thus we know
[55:10] they
[55:11] did we know that under the
[55:14] administration of Enoch that God
[55:17] prophesied that there would come a time
[55:21] and then
[55:22] methusa of course when he was born and
[55:26] given the name
[55:28] methusa which was
[55:31] predating the flood which part of the
[55:35] meaning of his name is after his end the
[55:39] Great Waters will come so his name in
[55:43] his name was embedded a prophetic vision
[55:48] of
[55:49] God but by the time it comes now Enoch
[55:53] has gone Enos is is gone Seth is gone
[55:59] and the righteous are fewer and
[56:03] fewer the people had become so violent
[56:07] and
[56:08] corrupt God does not pay attention to
[56:12] their
[56:13] education God does not describe how
[56:17] brilliant they were Now by this time
[56:19] they had already advanced in science
[56:23] they had already built the hour of
[56:27] course not of Babel but they had started
[56:30] up with Pinnacles and zigurat that they
[56:33] were something about them trying to
[56:36] raise elevations in
[56:40] buildings and we know that the pyramids
[56:43] actually predated the anian
[56:46] destruction and it was under the
[56:49] administration of Eno that they built it
[56:52] as a matter of fact there's a chamber
[56:55] inside the Great pyramid which is called
[56:58] after the name of
[57:01] Enoch so it predated the anti- deluvian
[57:06] destruction and the further they went
[57:09] the more to their own wisdom and their
[57:12] own cunning devices that they begin to
[57:15] depend and the righteous people on the
[57:18] Earth were getting in the minority was
[57:21] every decade of people that came now see
[57:25] people were still living 800 900 years
[57:31] old methusa the oldest man that we have
[57:34] record of lived to be
[57:38] 969 years
[57:40] old by that time men had become so
[57:45] rotten notice that the Bible says the
[57:48] Earth also was corrupt before God and
[57:51] the Earth was filled now it wasn't just
[57:55] a little a little bit over here and the
[57:58] majority of it was righteous but
[58:01] violence had
[58:03] overtaken the
[58:05] good notice again in verse
[58:08] 12 and God
[58:11] looked upon the
[58:13] Earth and
[58:15] behold it was
[58:18] corrupt isn't this amazing now in verse
[58:21] 11 Moses says it was corrupt and verse
[58:26] 12 he says it was corrupt for All Flesh
[58:30] had corrupted his way upon the Earth and
[58:35] God said unto Noah the end now notice
[58:40] here where we are the end of All Flesh
[58:45] is come before me so here we see an end
[58:50] time in Genesis chapter 6 so we are not
[58:55] the first people
[58:56] to ever deal with end time conditions
[59:01] but we are the only people to deal with
[59:03] these particular end time
[59:07] conditions so Noah was dealing with end
[59:11] time conditions it was going to come the
[59:15] end when for many many years there were
[59:20] no longer be a great number of people on
[59:23] the
[59:24] Earth can you
[59:26] imagine the
[59:28] scarcity and the feeling of fear and
[59:33] quietness that must have been almost
[59:36] overwhelming when they stepped out of
[59:39] the ark that
[59:42] day and there was eight
[59:47] adults
[59:48] eight
[59:53] people a pair of elephants
[59:56] camels donkeys and so
[1:00:00] on and ate adult human
[1:00:06] beings you would hear no City
[1:00:09] sounds because there were no
[1:00:15] cities it must have been peaceful for a
[1:00:19] while but fearful as
[1:00:23] well that end time left
[1:00:26] to a total
[1:00:29] annihilation of the human
[1:00:33] race had God not preserved a
[1:00:37] seed there would have not been one human
[1:00:40] being left on the face of the Earth
[1:00:44] amen notice God again repeats this in
[1:00:48] verse 13 and God said unto Noah the end
[1:00:51] of All Flesh has come before me for the
[1:00:55] Earth is
[1:00:56] filled with
[1:01:00] Hamas
[1:01:03] violence through them and behold I will
[1:01:08] destroy
[1:01:09] them with the
[1:01:13] Earth we may wonder why the Lord has not
[1:01:18] already come for his bread no doubt
[1:01:22] there's many things that make us
[1:01:27] the timing of the coming of the Lord
[1:01:31] there may be a few names that's on the
[1:01:33] book of redemption yet that have not
[1:01:35] fully been
[1:01:37] redeemed there could be some that are
[1:01:39] saved but have not yet reive the Holy
[1:01:42] Ghost there could be some who have been
[1:01:46] saved have received the Holy Ghost but
[1:01:48] they still lack a little bit more
[1:01:51] maturity in the life before the Rapture
[1:01:55] Ready
[1:01:56] then again there could be some more
[1:01:58] foolish virgin and the long mercy of God
[1:02:03] will continue to delay until they are
[1:02:06] brought in then again there could be
[1:02:09] some Jews that are still in the Bronx or
[1:02:14] the Jewish quarter of New York and
[1:02:18] they've not yet come back to the
[1:02:20] Homeland or there could be some more
[1:02:23] mechanics of Satan's re
[1:02:26] that is not quite where it needs to be
[1:02:29] and also there could be a little bit
[1:02:33] more that needs to be added to the cup
[1:02:37] of the
[1:02:38] iniquity of the
[1:02:41] amorites because what our father is
[1:02:44] fixing to allow to happen on this Earth
[1:02:48] has never happened before nor will it
[1:02:51] ever
[1:02:52] happen again amen
[1:02:55] he must be
[1:02:58] just before he allows
[1:03:01] Russia to bomb our
[1:03:04] nation into such a place that the
[1:03:08] seventh Vision that the prophet saw he
[1:03:13] did not see skyscrapers left in New
[1:03:16] York he did not see the Hippodrome left
[1:03:21] he did not see great convention centers
[1:03:24] and great Express ways and Los
[1:03:28] Angeles but he saw
[1:03:30] craters and
[1:03:32] Blackness and
[1:03:35] Ashes and millions in America will die
[1:03:40] at one
[1:03:42] time now just keep in mind we are not
[1:03:46] that far from Oak
[1:03:48] Ridge and we sure ain't that far from
[1:03:53] NFS and we sure ain't that far from a
[1:03:55] lot of other oh I'll run and I'll hide
[1:03:58] there's only one place you can hide
[1:04:00] friend that's in Christ Jesus
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:04] amen notice again the prophet says it's
[1:04:08] the spirit of anything that does the
[1:04:10] work of it anyhow the spirit of anything
[1:04:14] the people have to be in this kind of a
[1:04:17] spirit to bring the latter days the
[1:04:22] people's in the spirit of the latter
[1:04:24] days the nation s are in the spirit of
[1:04:28] the end time they've got Atomic weapons
[1:04:32] hydrogen weapons all kinds of things
[1:04:36] because it's the spirit of the
[1:04:41] day the people are in the spirit of the
[1:04:44] end time and the church is moving
[1:04:47] together under the power and the impact
[1:04:50] of the Holy Spirit and the world's
[1:04:53] running out yonder making fun
[1:04:56] scoffing laughing and they're living
[1:04:59] like the devil every day it's the spirit
[1:05:04] of the
[1:05:05] thing again he says we've got to get in
[1:05:08] the spirit of the last days when the
[1:05:11] last days are here you go to a dance
[1:05:15] hall you can't get in the spirit of
[1:05:17] dancing or they won't dance you've got
[1:05:20] to go to the church notice now so people
[1:05:23] go to a dance hall and there's a SP
[1:05:25] spirit that they will get under now
[1:05:28] there may be other people there dancing
[1:05:30] and the music may be right and they're
[1:05:32] just sitting there sitting there sitting
[1:05:34] there why because they're not under the
[1:05:36] spirit of dancing and then all of a
[1:05:39] sudden it just hits them well I want to
[1:05:42] dance now you understand what happened
[1:05:44] to them they that Spirit of dancing
[1:05:47] worldly dance got on them and then they
[1:05:51] felt like dancing well if it can happen
[1:05:53] to devils and unbelievers I believe the
[1:05:56] Holy Ghost Dance can happen to us as the
[1:05:58] people of
[1:05:59] God well praise the Lord now notice he
[1:06:02] said you've got to get in the spirit of
[1:06:04] worship before you can worship the
[1:06:07] world's got to get in the spirit of the
[1:06:09] last days before the last days can come
[1:06:13] and we're in the spirit of the last days
[1:06:17] how many believes it look at this now
[1:06:22] 1954 and God promised these things would
[1:06:25] be here and that's what things that
[1:06:28] we've got were in the last days and men
[1:06:31] and women are setting
[1:06:34] asleep and don't realize it we cannot
[1:06:39] have the last day until people gets in
[1:06:43] the spirit of the last St so what is
[1:06:46] going to be part of the prophetic
[1:06:50] utterance that will be fulfilled in the
[1:06:53] last day great
[1:06:57] Annihilation great
[1:06:59] destruction so the predominating say
[1:07:02] that people will be under is not just
[1:07:06] building now building is one of the
[1:07:07] signs of the end time but it's not the
[1:07:10] only one one of the main ones that will
[1:07:13] take precedent will be
[1:07:16] destruction so people under the in time
[1:07:20] anointing will get under the spirit of
[1:07:24] destruction
[1:07:25] and the spirit of
[1:07:28] fighting and the spirit of
[1:07:32] intimidation come on
[1:07:34] somebody and the spirit of trying to
[1:07:37] quieten people that will oppose
[1:07:42] them amen oh they believe in freedom of
[1:07:45] speech as long as it's them got the
[1:07:48] freedom and they got the speech but they
[1:07:50] don't want anybody that opposes them of
[1:07:53] course to have the same freedom and the
[1:07:56] church said notice we cannot have a
[1:07:59] healing service until people gets in the
[1:08:02] spirit of a healing service we cannot
[1:08:05] have a filling of the Holy Ghost until
[1:08:08] people gets in that kind of an
[1:08:12] atmosphere and the people was in the
[1:08:15] atmosphere in the day to bring
[1:08:18] judgment upon the Earth they were in the
[1:08:23] same atmosphere today eating drinking
[1:08:27] marrying giving in marriage and all this
[1:08:31] kind of thing like that and the glory of
[1:08:34] God is being preached and demonstrated
[1:08:38] and the power of the Holy Ghost setting
[1:08:40] for us an example of the resurrection of
[1:08:43] Jesus Christ is going to take the church
[1:08:45] into Glory just as certain as I'm
[1:08:47] standing here that's right and men are
[1:08:49] ignoring it paying no attention to it
[1:08:54] walking away from it it walking away
[1:08:57] from it walking away from
[1:09:02] it because they're in the spirit of the
[1:09:06] last day you see part of the anointing
[1:09:10] that must be releas in this our in time
[1:09:14] is that they will walk away from the
[1:09:17] truth Peter of course goes on to tell us
[1:09:20] it would have been better for them to
[1:09:22] have never known the way of
[1:09:24] righteousness then after they have known
[1:09:26] it and tasted of it as Paul says in
[1:09:29] Hebrews 6 and then to turn and walk away
[1:09:33] they would have been better off let me
[1:09:34] tell you some friends some of the folks
[1:09:36] that have walked away from this message
[1:09:37] they would have been better off to stay
[1:09:39] Baptist they would have been better off
[1:09:41] to stay Methodist that' have been better
[1:09:43] off to stay Pentecost but they come and
[1:09:46] set where the revealing of the word was
[1:09:49] breaking force and now they'll be held
[1:09:51] accountable for
[1:09:53] it but yet they can only stay there so
[1:09:57] long it's not a surprising thing to me
[1:10:00] that there had to come a falling away
[1:10:03] and our ranks in the message because it
[1:10:05] was inevitable and there's no question
[1:10:07] about it there were people sitting Among
[1:10:09] Us that were not ordained to feed this
[1:10:12] on this reveal word of the hour and it
[1:10:14] attracted their attention but yet they
[1:10:17] could not Feast upon the unfailing body
[1:10:20] word of the son of man so what must they
[1:10:23] do they must find fault somehow many of
[1:10:26] them are not going to come right out and
[1:10:28] say I was totally wrong I was deceived
[1:10:31] by these people they ain't no way
[1:10:32] they're going to say that so they've got
[1:10:34] to find fault with it some way well when
[1:10:36] they started preaching that I had to
[1:10:38] start pulling away I had to come on just
[1:10:40] go ahead and be honest you went back
[1:10:42] back to your hog trough you went back to
[1:10:45] your vomit you lying
[1:10:48] dog well praise the Lord that's what the
[1:10:51] Bible said to do as the dog went back to
[1:10:54] its vomit and the
[1:10:55] went back to her wallowing in the m so
[1:10:58] do people do when they walk away from
[1:11:00] the truth of the word of God and let me
[1:11:03] just say that's what happened in our
[1:11:05] ranks preachers have done it late people
[1:11:07] have done it they went back to their
[1:11:09] slop you know why they was a hog when
[1:11:12] they was in it and believe it or not
[1:11:14] there was a hog when they was Among Us
[1:11:17] they may have quoted quotes and they may
[1:11:19] have even stood behind the pulpit and
[1:11:21] preached it but in reality by Nature
[1:11:24] there's still an no hog that's right
[1:11:26] well that's right now notice the world
[1:11:29] has got to get like this God would be
[1:11:32] unjust to pour His wrath out upon a just
[1:11:37] people they're they've ignored him and
[1:11:40] walked away and Satan captured them now
[1:11:43] notice he must be just keep that before
[1:11:46] you for the utter Annihilation that is
[1:11:50] fixing to break force on our world for
[1:11:54] God to allow Satan to be able to come
[1:11:58] down in a way like he has never done
[1:12:01] before the condition of the earth must
[1:12:05] be worse than it was in the days of Noah
[1:12:10] it will have to be worse than it was in
[1:12:13] the days of the first crucifixion of our
[1:12:17] Lord
[1:12:19] Jesus and it
[1:12:21] is we're in the spirit of the latter
[1:12:24] days now know part of what makes people
[1:12:27] this is the one of ways we can identify
[1:12:29] them people are he High minded can't
[1:12:34] tell them
[1:12:36] nothing they know it
[1:12:42] all now do you understand you don't have
[1:12:44] to belong to a denomination to have that
[1:12:46] attitude as a matter of fact there's a
[1:12:49] lot of folks that said in message
[1:12:50] churches that's got this attitude right
[1:12:52] here and let me just tell you if you're
[1:12:54] here like tonight you better get that
[1:12:56] evil thing off of you because that is a
[1:12:59] last day anointing getting people ready
[1:13:02] for the tribulation not the Rapture the
[1:13:05] Rapture anointing does not make you and
[1:13:08] I annoy it all and that nobody can't
[1:13:12] tell us nothing come on a real child of
[1:13:15] God can be corrected anytime any day any
[1:13:19] moment any week any months by the word
[1:13:23] of God that come to me with your opinion
[1:13:26] don't come to me with your idea but if
[1:13:29] you've got something in the scripture
[1:13:31] you've got something in the message of
[1:13:32] the hour I can be corrected by the word
[1:13:36] because I have the Holy Ghost but many
[1:13:40] people in and around our ranks cannot be
[1:13:43] corrected you cannot talk to them you
[1:13:46] can't tell them anything because they
[1:13:48] have a smart elic attitude well preach
[1:13:51] brother Donnie and you can't tell them
[1:13:54] nothing well if you don't get that off
[1:13:56] of you you're going into the tribulation
[1:13:59] period he sure there's a God in
[1:14:01] heaven and the Saints
[1:14:04] said oh my the people are in the spirit
[1:14:08] of the last days just like they was in

[1:15:52] States and they drank whiskey and smoke
[1:15:54] cigarettes and life hat and everything
[1:15:56] else just the same they're in the spirit
[1:15:59] of the last days and God cannot s
[1:16:03] destruction before the people are in the
[1:16:07] spirit for
[1:16:11] Destruction so if they're in the spirit
[1:16:14] for Destruction how are they going to
[1:16:17] act it out theys will start
[1:16:23] destroying so they will be concerned
[1:16:26] about destroying people's reputation
[1:16:28] people's honor they will do whatever
[1:16:30] they can do on Facebook it's just
[1:16:32] something in them it's the anointing
[1:16:34] they've got to destroy they've got to
[1:16:36] tear down well if they got a lie they
[1:16:39] got a Twist of truth whatever it is you
[1:16:41] watch people they get under that and you
[1:16:42] remember that's not the Rapture
[1:16:45] anointing that's a tribulation anointing
[1:16:48] and it's something on the people of this
[1:16:50] age and friend we will never stop it
[1:16:54] I'll never be able to preach it out of
[1:16:56] the world neither will any other man it
[1:16:58] is the spirit of the last day but I do
[1:17:02] hope I can preach it out of my
[1:17:05] sheep what's in message people that
[1:17:08] would want to destroy one another
[1:17:10] destroy people and just because they
[1:17:12] disagree with us my goodness where is
[1:17:15] our love of God inside of our hearts for
[1:17:17] one another
[1:17:20] friends oh my in the spirit for destru
[1:17:25] God never did destroy it he saying man

[1:18:21] reason we want to get somebody in here
[1:18:24] that'll let us do anything we want to do
[1:18:27] that's the way the churches they want to

[1:25:06] they'll calm down a little bit but
[1:25:07] they've done got their foot in the door
[1:25:09] now and one of the worst things they
[1:25:11] ever do is meet with them and compromise
[1:25:15] as they did earlier this morning when
[1:25:17] they did in one of the universities up
[1:25:19] in Rhode Island and they said well what
[1:25:21] do you all want tell us what you want
[1:25:23] and we'll compromise one the biggest
[1:25:24] mistakes Israel ever made when they made
[1:25:27] it years ago and they captured one of
[1:25:29] their Heroes the PLO captured one of
[1:25:32] their Heroes and they said we will never
[1:25:35] we will never meet and talk to you all
[1:25:38] but the pressure from the people they
[1:25:40] gave in and they W giving about 2,000
[1:25:43] Palestinian prisoners for one Israeli
[1:25:46] guy cuz that's the way they look at
[1:25:48] their value of one person they would
[1:25:51] value one to 5,000 or 1 to 10 ,000 well
[1:25:54] I wish somebody would preach with me
[1:25:56] tonight but it was one of the most worst
[1:25:58] mistakes they ever done because they
[1:26:00] sent those organizations a message so if
[1:26:04] you capture them they will give in to
[1:26:06] you that's why Hamas is doing what
[1:26:09] they're doing because our president's
[1:26:11] joining sides with them a lot of our
[1:26:14] people are joining Sid well come on now

[1:26:25] Folks up to New York send a few more
[1:26:28] down to Texas send a few more up to the

[1:27:42] time but it'll be a voice against them
[1:27:45] at the day of judgment but if they're
[1:27:47] under their anointing then what about us

[1:29:27] they're hollering my Carol and I watch a
[1:29:29] little bit of it on YouTube acting worse
[1:29:31] than a bunch of animals screaming and
[1:29:34] hollering and carrying on I told her I
[1:29:36] said it would be amazing to be able to
[1:29:39] break into that realm of that Dimension
[1:29:41] and see how many demons are around there
[1:29:44] hundreds and hundreds of them screaming
[1:29:47] and screaming and attacking the police
[1:29:49] and treating them with such dishonor and
[1:29:52] disrespect and then their parents as
[1:29:54] soon as they go down and the da is not
[1:29:56] going to prosecute them they're not
[1:29:58] going to get them for anything you know
[1:29:59] what they're going to do don't you do
[1:30:02] that
[1:30:03] again now the next time you spit on a
[1:30:06] cop
[1:30:09] don't you
[1:30:11] just do it in a more Sanctified
[1:30:17] way you know why parents are a bunch of
[1:30:21] educated idiots themselves
[1:30:28] well
[1:30:30] glory god of this evil age the world is
[1:30:34] coming heading to a climax
[1:30:37] why the
[1:30:40] spirit of
[1:30:45] lawlessness I heard a reporter today on
[1:30:48] my radio on my truck using the same word
[1:30:51] over and over again
[1:30:54] I'm so glad that we're partakers of a
[1:30:57] prophetic message you see any preacher
[1:31:00] now can be able to stand up preach it
[1:31:01] and go back and see where we are now
[1:31:03] this was being preached when it wasn't
[1:31:05] going on this was being preached har
[1:31:08] when it looked like everything was at
[1:31:09] peace this is pre 1968 this is prev
[1:31:13] Vietnam War this is in between the
[1:31:15] Korean conflict and all that so there
[1:31:16] ain't no Wars and things going on but a
[1:31:18] prophet has the ability to look out
[1:31:20] there in time no doubt he looked right
[1:31:22] out there and saw Columbia University he
[1:31:25] looked right up there and saw NYU UCLA
[1:31:28] he saw all of that taking place he saw
[1:31:31] how that it would be in the end time I'm
[1:31:33] so glad he could come back and warn us
[1:31:36] with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:38] and say get ready children get ready
[1:31:41] when you see this you know the time is
[1:31:43] now when you see them getting Anointed
[1:31:45] with violence and hatred get ready pack
[1:31:48] up you're fixing to leave
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:55] the world is heading to a climax a
[1:31:57] spirit of
[1:31:59] lawlessness moral
[1:32:01] Decay
[1:32:03] scientific
[1:32:06] religion has led it to a
[1:32:09] cage of every
[1:32:12] hateful and unclean
[1:32:15] bird as the Bible
[1:32:20] said second Timothy chapter 3 verse 1
[1:32:24] this know also that in the last days
[1:32:26] perilous
[1:32:27] times shall come can y'all say
[1:32:31] Amen the word
[1:32:33] translated perilous is
[1:32:36] violent
[1:32:38] Fierce
[1:32:40] wild and
[1:32:43] difficult violent Fierce
[1:32:47] wild and difficult Grievious to
[1:32:51] bear distressing
[1:32:57] Grievous to Bear distressing
[1:33:00] painful difficult hard
[1:33:04] times I tell you friends if there's ever
[1:33:06] a time to get closer to God it's now
[1:33:11] am Luke
[1:33:13] 219 but when ye shall hear of
[1:33:18] wars and
[1:33:20] commotions Russian
[1:33:22] TV gave another warning last night and
[1:33:26] they warned
[1:33:28] America of a nuclear war if they don't
[1:33:33] back out of the Middle
[1:33:40] East when you shall hear of wars and
[1:33:44] commotions confusion
[1:33:47] tumult
[1:33:49] instability a state of disorder
[1:33:53] and
[1:33:55] disturbance
[1:33:57] insurrections against order Lawless
[1:34:02] that's part of the end
[1:34:03] time the prophet tells us that the Bible
[1:34:06] says in the last
[1:34:08] days in the last days that children will
[1:34:14] rule their
[1:34:19] parents Josephus the Jewish historian to
[1:34:23] sit
[1:34:25] the Roman
[1:34:26] historian described the period
[1:34:29] immediately following the
[1:34:32] crucifixion as full of Wars crimes
[1:34:37] violences and great
[1:34:39] earthquakes notice the time frame now
[1:34:43] these men are not Christians they're not
[1:34:44] Paul they're not Peter Josephus was a
[1:34:48] Jew a great Jewish historian but became
[1:34:51] also a part of the Roman Legions and
[1:34:55] they would actually use him to write
[1:34:57] their history as well pitus was a Roman
[1:35:02] himself toito says it was a time rich in
[1:35:06] disasters horrible with
[1:35:09] battles torn with
[1:35:12] sedition
[1:35:14] Savage even in time of
[1:35:17] Peace
[1:35:19] Savage even in time of peace now listen
[1:35:21] what Jesus said but when you shall hear
[1:35:23] of wars and
[1:35:25] commotions be not
[1:35:29] terrified oh my
[1:35:31] goodness it must going to be a horrible
[1:35:34] time brother John that the Lord Jesus
[1:35:37] would have to speak to his own and say
[1:35:39] when it comes don't you all be
[1:35:45] terrified
[1:35:47] a
[1:35:49] terrified which comes of course from the
[1:35:51] root word our English word word
[1:35:57] Terror Satan is the
[1:35:59] original
[1:36:05] terrorist think friends we have people

[1:36:12] are out there marching with them and
[1:36:14] some of the professors who's actually
[1:36:17] taught this Tommy rot for
[1:36:19] years they're right out there with
[1:36:22] them voting it oh it's our right of free
[1:36:25] speech and they're breaking out windows

[1:36:32] soldiers that died on
[1:36:34] D-Day in Normandy beats 9,000
[1:36:38] Graves 9,000 of our American Graves
[1:36:42] there gave their lives that we could set
[1:36:46] here tonight for the freedom of religion
[1:36:48] to be able to worship God and then we
[1:36:51] have people on these campuses take our
[1:36:53] stars and stripes down and fire a flag
[1:36:56] of a
[1:36:58] moss and another one in
[1:37:06] fatata brother Donnie if you can't make

[1:37:18] going to have some men that's going to
[1:37:19] scream out against this
[1:37:25] be not
[1:37:27] terrified don't be frightened or
[1:37:29] startled indicating a strong feeling of
[1:37:34] Terror after the
[1:37:37] crucifixion all these things as these
[1:37:40] men begin to say happen Jesus in verse
[1:37:42] 10 said then he said unto them Nation
[1:37:45] shall rise against nation and Kingdom
[1:37:47] against Kingdom and great earthquakes
[1:37:50] shall be in diverse places and famines
[1:37:52] and pestilences and fearful
[1:37:57] sights and Great
[1:38:00] Signs there shall be from
[1:38:02] Heaven
[1:38:04] sites that which
[1:38:06] strikes
[1:38:09] Terror a cause of fright Josephus
[1:38:13] relating about the signs and wonders
[1:38:15] which preceded The Taking of Jerusalem
[1:38:18] under
[1:38:19] Titus mentions that a star
[1:38:23] hang over the city of
[1:38:25] Jerusalem like a
[1:38:28] sword and an appearance like a comet and
[1:38:32] continued for a whole
[1:38:36] year so here it was hanging over
[1:38:39] Jerusalem like a sword a comet for a
[1:38:44] whole year that people being assembled
[1:38:47] to celebrate the Feast of unlimited
[1:38:49] bread at the ninth hour of the night
[1:38:51] there're Shone so great a light
[1:38:54] about the Altar and the temple that it
[1:38:56] seemed to be bright day and this
[1:38:59] continued for a half an hour fearful
[1:39:04] sights the Eastern Gate of the temple
[1:39:07] which was of solid
[1:39:09] brass and was scarcely to be shot by 20
[1:39:14] men was seen at the sixth hour of the
[1:39:18] night to open on its own accord
[1:39:24] so this gate was so humongous and
[1:39:26] weighed so much taking 20 men to open it
[1:39:30] but in the sixth hour of the night it
[1:39:34] opens on its own
[1:39:37] accord though fastened by strong bars
[1:39:42] and
[1:39:43] bolts angels can break bars and undo
[1:39:48] bolts and could hardly be shut again
[1:39:52] before the setting of The that was seen
[1:39:54] all over the
[1:39:56] country
[1:39:58] chariots and armies fighting in the
[1:40:07] clouds you talking about God being
[1:40:11] merciful now remember there was some
[1:40:14] saints in
[1:40:15] there but that wasn't one of them caught
[1:40:19] whenever Titus come in and locked up
[1:40:21] that City cuz Jesus Jesus warned
[1:40:25] him he said pray that your flight be not
[1:40:27] in the wi he talking about the Rapture
[1:40:29] he's talking about the day when Titus is
[1:40:31] going to lay The Siege pray that your
[1:40:33] fight be not in the winter pray this
[1:40:35] pray that and them elect seed inside
[1:40:37] they say hey remember Jesus said this
[1:40:39] and Jesus said that that prophetic word
[1:40:41] of God brother John some of them went
[1:40:43] under the wall some went over the wall
[1:40:45] someone through the gate but they
[1:40:46] wouldn't one of them closed up in that
[1:40:48] denominational
[1:40:50] wall praise be to God they made it out
[1:40:54] of there them signs you imagine them
[1:40:56] saints of God as they saw that star and
[1:40:59] that sword up there in the heavens
[1:41:01] whenever they heard about the light
[1:41:02] whenever they saw all these things oh
[1:41:04] Lord Jesus is coming Lord Jesus is
[1:41:07] coming All Saints may we be the same way
[1:41:10] maybe we not sat around oh well brother
[1:41:12] Donnie we've had these protests before
[1:41:14] but there ain't never been none like
[1:41:16] what we're dealing was now we've had
[1:41:18] signs before yes but we ain't never had
[1:41:21] nothing like what we're dealing with now
[1:41:23] and it ain't going to do nothing but get
[1:41:24] worse but I hope you don't think I'm a
[1:41:26] Nut but it has to get worse before it
[1:41:28] can get better for us so I say it this
[1:41:31] way Bring it on Bring it on whatever's
[1:41:36] got to happen Lord bring it on so we can
[1:41:39] get ready to leave this world it can't
[1:41:42] be too much
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:48] longer the Roman tacitus confirms every
[1:41:52] one of the these particulars in his
[1:41:55] history the testimonies of Josephus and
[1:41:57] tacitus serve in some measure to confirm
[1:42:00] the
[1:42:01] predictions of Jesus
[1:42:04] himself verse 25 there shall be signs in
[1:42:07] the sun and the moon and the stars and
[1:42:09] upon the Earth's
[1:42:10] distress of nations with perplexity the
[1:42:14] Sea and the waves
[1:42:18] roaring do you know that the
[1:42:21] IC the International
[1:42:25] court is considering having
[1:42:29] Netanyahu
[1:42:31] arrested and Gant
[1:42:35] arrested of course no
[1:42:39] mention of Y yah
[1:42:42] sinir or all the rest of them Hamas
[1:42:47] heads they of it are these people
[1:42:51] nuts think of we
[1:42:54] are Israel is still having to deal with
[1:42:57] rockets on a weekly
[1:43:00] basis they're still having their people
[1:43:04] killed I'm exposing one off yesterday
[1:43:07] another one the day before how come we
[1:43:09] don't hear anybody say nothing about
[1:43:12] it don't you see friend the anointing
[1:43:15] has
[1:43:16] surged just in the last few
[1:43:21] weeks one day it'll ser words to that
[1:43:23] place and the Lord will say it's
[1:43:28] over no
[1:43:30] more it's not safe for my queen to be on
[1:43:35] the
[1:43:38] earth oh
[1:43:45] Lord there should be signs in the Sun
[1:43:47] and in the moon and in the stars and
[1:43:50] upon the Earth distress and the word
[1:43:53] stress is anxiety of
[1:43:55] Mind such as men saw when they would try
[1:43:59] to free thems from great Calamity and
[1:44:03] Trauma that they saw were coming so it
[1:44:06] would be so great and so
[1:44:08] overwhelming with great
[1:44:11] perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring
[1:44:14] Jesus ain't talking about the Atlantic
[1:44:15] Ocean the Mediterranean the Pacific but
[1:44:17] it's a symbolism of course people Waters
[1:44:21] multitudes and it's the sea would come
[1:44:23] and one wave after another getting
[1:44:25] bigger and bigger the
[1:44:27] accumulation and the Earth will be so
[1:44:29] overwhelmed by it people will carried
[1:44:32] out to see in the spiritual sense you
[1:44:36] you see what's happening to people
[1:44:39] they're being carried out to
[1:44:43] see
[1:44:45] spiritually they're getting out in over
[1:44:47] their head they're getting involved in
[1:44:50] sin and they're getting involved in this
[1:44:51] and that and the other
[1:44:53] and they're find their s out and they're
[1:44:55] going down and they're going down they
[1:44:57] never intended to get that far the
[1:44:59] undercurrent so pulled them
[1:45:07] out Lord
[1:45:10] God men's Hearts failing
[1:45:14] them for
[1:45:16] fear
[1:45:18] looking after those things which are
[1:45:20] coming on the Earth
[1:45:23] for the powers of
[1:45:26] Heaven shall be
[1:45:34] shaken I don't mind telling you I would
[1:45:37] rather be in the
[1:45:40] word than even in the powers of
[1:45:46] Heaven for the powers of the
[1:45:49] heavens can and will be shaken
[1:45:54] the stars under the six seal will be
[1:45:58] shaken out of their
[1:46:00] position you imagine when them two
[1:46:02] prophets friends you understand work so
[1:46:04] close no doubt Moses and Elijah are
[1:46:09] already on the
[1:46:12] earth two men that are born like any
[1:46:15] other men and won't be the literal one
[1:46:18] necessarily but the anointing will come
[1:46:21] upon them they're already probably
[1:46:24] already
[1:46:25] here maybe living in Jerusalem maybe
[1:46:27] Beth Haven maybe down in Bea who knows
[1:46:30] exactly where they
[1:46:32] are they may not even know yet who they
[1:46:35] are but God working on them glory to God
[1:46:40] getting them ready God won't deal with
[1:46:42] both now at the same time he don't will
[1:46:44] deal with the Gentile bride and the
[1:46:48] 144,000 but remember when the angel of
[1:46:51] the Lord
[1:46:53] stepped into that building that
[1:46:55] night when the prophet of God was there
[1:46:58] remember it's the same time frame that
[1:47:01] Israel was
[1:47:02] declared a
[1:47:06] nation and the angel of God walked in
[1:47:09] and gave him his commission and in that
[1:47:13] same time frame
[1:47:15] Israel coming to her
[1:47:18] spot Harry sent me a quote before
[1:47:21] church the rent in
[1:47:24] 1957 he must have been looking at some
[1:47:26] of the events that was going on and he
[1:47:28] said it looks like our
[1:47:31] nation will join with the
[1:47:36] Arabs and when they do she's done he
[1:47:42] said you imagine 1957 what would he say
[1:47:46] if he could look around
[1:47:50] tonight oh my
[1:47:53] as
[1:47:57] barious the political and social
[1:48:01] crisis physical disturbance in the
[1:48:05] world church church
[1:48:09] politics it will get so
[1:48:11] traumatic that people will look at it
[1:48:14] and have such
[1:48:15] fear they will have heart
[1:48:18] attacks won't be able to take it because
[1:48:21] the trauma and the fear of what's going
[1:48:23] to
[1:48:26] happen while your heads are bowed let me
[1:48:28] read this verse to you from second Peter
[1:48:30] 3:7 but the heavens and the Earths which
[1:48:33] are now by the same word are kept in
[1:48:35] store reserved into fire against the day
[1:48:39] of judgment and
[1:48:40] predition of ungodly
[1:48:43] men in verse 10 he says but the day of
[1:48:46] the Lord will come as a thief in the
[1:48:48] night in which the heavens shall pass
[1:48:50] away with a great noise in the element
[1:48:53] shall
[1:48:54] melt with fervent heat the Earth also
[1:48:58] and the works that are therein shall be
[1:49:01] burned
[1:49:03] up but this is our verse verse 12
[1:49:07] looking for and hastening unto the
[1:49:11] coming of the day of
[1:49:15] God the coming of the day of
[1:49:20] God where in the heavens being on
[1:49:24] fire shall be
[1:49:26] dissolved and the elements shall
[1:49:29] melt with fervent
[1:49:34] heat oh Lord
[1:49:38] Jesus I understand that Mr Jeff Bezos

[1:51:39] Redemption the prophet told us in 1964
[1:51:41] in question answers there's only one
[1:51:44] hope for the
[1:51:45] church and that's the coming of the Lord
[1:51:50] Jesus praise God
[1:51:54] praise
[1:51:56] God we worship you tonight
[1:52:01] Jesus Oh Lamb of God we ask you for your
[1:52:07] help this is our
[1:52:10] home this is where most of us were
[1:52:14] born this is the only nation many of
[1:52:17] these people have ever been in they've
[1:52:19] never even set their feet in another
[1:52:21] Nation
[1:52:26] and we're Americans as far as that would
[1:52:30] go it breaks our hearts to think of
[1:52:33] what's heading this
[1:52:36] way I can see exactly why Satan don't
[1:52:40] want this message preached I told Carol
[1:52:42] the other day I it's pretty evident to
[1:52:44] me why Satan don't want this message
[1:52:46] preached because it contains such
[1:52:49] illumination about the end time
[1:52:53] people can preach their Bible and
[1:52:55] without the light of this end time
[1:52:56] message they can still be as blind as
[1:52:58] they can be this is why he hates for
[1:53:02] this message to be
[1:53:05] preached oh but we love it
[1:53:09] father we love it Lord
[1:53:12] Jesus but Lord we have to be
[1:53:15] honest we look around and
[1:53:18] think how much worse will it be Lord
[1:53:22] what more will happen father before it
[1:53:27] comes one day we may be forced to leave
[1:53:30] YouTube We may be forced to take our
[1:53:33] services down who knows what lays before
[1:53:37] us so father we want to preach while we
[1:53:40] can yes who knows what they'll
[1:53:44] do the prophet says they'll never shut
[1:53:49] her up she'll be taken up first yes and
[1:53:53] then other things it seems as if though
[1:53:55] he alludes to there may come such a time
[1:53:58] so I don't know
[1:54:00] Lord all I know is I want to be ready
[1:54:03] for whatever we're going to
[1:54:07] face oh Jesus we love you
[1:54:10] tonight come Lord
[1:54:13] Jesus come Lord
[1:54:16] Jesus look at me
[1:54:19] children I've preached around the world
[1:54:21] and preached to many different cultures
[1:54:24] many different races of
[1:54:26] people talked to many people and the
[1:54:29] message and I have never in all my years
[1:54:33] in the
[1:54:35] ministry heard from the saints of
[1:54:38] God that they are so hungry for the
[1:54:41] coming of the Lord
[1:54:43] Jesus anybody feel that
[1:54:45] way I know for
[1:54:48] myself I I've wanted to see him come
[1:54:50] since I was a boy but I have never
[1:54:53] longed for
[1:54:55] it the way I long for it now every day I
[1:55:00] talk to him about
[1:55:02] it or you say why would you do that
[1:55:05] don't you understand one reason why I
[1:55:06] would do it God has put
[1:55:10] Souls of human beings in these
[1:55:14] hands can you imagine if God had put
[1:55:18] hundreds of souls in your hands how you
[1:55:21] would feel
[1:55:24] one day I will walk before him and I
[1:55:26] will have to give an
[1:55:30] account I don't want to fail him by the
[1:55:34] Michael I don't want him to look at me
[1:55:36] with anger in his eyes and say you
[1:55:39] didn't preach what I told you to preach
[1:55:41] you
[1:55:42] compromised you got
[1:55:46] soft I'm going to tell you the truth
[1:55:48] friends you may get mad at me sometimes
[1:55:51] but I'm going to tell you the truth I
[1:55:54] want us to stand before him that day and
[1:55:56] when we stand there we won't have to
[1:55:58] shake and tremble and be terrified we
[1:56:01] can stand there with every confidence in
[1:56:04] the message of the hour cuz I believe we
[1:56:06] were there by representation of those
[1:56:08] theophonic voices whenever they a oh my
[1:56:12] as they hollered back to the prophet of
[1:56:14] God he said I taught everything Paul
[1:56:16] said and they said we are resting on
[1:56:19] that
[1:56:24] Can We Stand
