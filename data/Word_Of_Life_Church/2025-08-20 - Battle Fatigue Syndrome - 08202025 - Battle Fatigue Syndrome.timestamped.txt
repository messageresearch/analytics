[25:27] like only you can.
[25:30] So if the Lord fills the house, nobody

[25:50] going to shake his ground. If the Lord

[26:09] through storm and through fire,
[26:12] but where God holds together,
[26:15] it stands firm every time.

[26:23] on this all the truth
[26:27] that we got holds together.
[26:30] No, it can't be moved.
[26:35] If the Lord builds a house, nobody can
[26:40] tear it down. If the Lord builds a
[26:44] house, nobody can tear it down. When

[26:54] going to shake this ground. If the Lord
[26:58] builds the house, nobody can tear it
[27:02] down.
[27:06] As for me and my house, but we're going
[27:09] to serve you, Lord.
[27:13] So, here's the kiss. Come on in.
[27:17] Everything we have is yours.
[27:21] As for me and my house, we're going to
[27:24] serve you, Lord.
[27:28] So, here's the keys. Come on in.
[27:31] Everything we have is yours.
[27:35] Ask for me in my house. We're going to
[27:39] serve you, Lord.
[27:42] So, here's the keys. Come on in.

[27:54] tear it down. If the Lord builds the
[27:58] house, nobody can tear it down. When
[28:03] it's built on his name, there's nothing
[28:08] going to shake this ground. If the Lord
[28:12] builds the house, nobody can tear it
[28:16] down.
[28:17] [Music]
[28:19] When it's built on his name, there's
[28:24] nothing going to shake this ground. If
[28:27] the Lord builds the house, nobody can
[28:32] tear it down. When it's built on his
[28:36] name, there's nothing going to shake
[28:39] this ground. If the Lord builds the
[28:43] house, nobody can tear it down.

[29:10] [Music]
[29:21] Why would I worry when giants come
[29:25] calling my name?
[29:32] My God is so much bigger than troubles I
[29:37] face.
[29:39] [Music]
[29:43] Why would I hunger for power or riches
[29:48] or fame?
[29:53] Oh, cuz my God is so much better than
[29:59] all of these things.
[30:04] So I won't be shen.
[30:10] I won't be moved.
[30:15] For my God is faithful.
[30:20] His promises are true.

[30:31] Oh, it's time to move.

[31:04] already
[31:06] won.

[31:26] and the grave.
[31:30] No, I won't be shen.

[31:42] My God is faithful.
[31:46] His promises are true.
[31:51] So I'll speak to the mountains.

[32:15] There's no mountain to high, no valley
[32:19] to low. There's no fear that I have. He
[32:23] doesn't already know. There's no problem
[32:27] too big, no weapon too strong. There is
[32:32] nothing for God that's impossible.
[32:36] There's no mountain to hide, no valley
[32:40] to go. There's no fear that I have. He
[32:45] doesn't already know. There's no problem
[32:48] to
[32:50] no weapon too strong. There is nothing
[32:54] for that's impossible.
[33:01] I won't be shen.
[33:06] No, I won't be.
[33:12] My God is faithful.
[33:17] His promises are true.

[33:55] [Applause]
[33:55] [Music]
[34:01] [Applause]
[34:03] How many believes that though you
[34:05] aren't?
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It don't make any
[34:09] difference what the devil puts before
[34:11] us. By God's grace, we will overcome.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Be of good cheer. I have
[34:18] overcome the world."
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. So,
[34:23] I'd already studied out for tonight
[34:28] uh what I thought we needed to hear.
[34:32] So, Carol and I went out for lunch today
[34:36] and I have the Jerusalem Post on my
[34:38] phone. So, while we're waiting for our
[34:40] food to come, we're sitting there just
[34:42] talking and we'll read news together and
[34:44] things like that. So, I opened up the
[34:46] Jerusalem Post and I saw where Israel is
[34:51] u fixing to bring 60,000
[34:54] more of their troops in. And I was
[34:57] reading a little bit down in the article
[34:59] to Carol and my eyes
[35:02] fell on two words.
[35:05] And just like that,
[35:09] God give me what you're going to hear
[35:11] tonight.
[35:13] Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Psalm 55:1
[35:21] to the chief musician
[35:24] on Naginos
[35:27] Mascu,
[35:28] a psalm of David.
[35:32] Give ear to my prayer, oh God, and hide
[35:35] not thyself from my supplication. Attend
[35:40] unto me and hear me.
[35:44] I mourn
[35:46] and my complaint
[35:48] and make a noise.
[35:51] Wow. He must have been pretty low,
[35:53] wasn't he? Attend unto me and hear me. I
[35:57] mourn in my complaint
[36:00] and make a noise
[36:03] because of the voice of the enemy
[36:06] because of the oppression of the wicked
[36:09] for they cast iniquity
[36:13] upon me. So his enemy was accusing him
[36:16] of all kinds of things and saying had
[36:18] done this and done that and the other
[36:20] and in wrath
[36:22] they hate me.
[36:25] My heart is sore pained within me and
[36:31] the terrors of death are fallen
[36:35] upon me.
[36:37] Fearfulness
[36:39] and trembling
[36:41] are come upon me. Now wait a minute.
[36:42] Isn't this the psalmist David?
[36:47] The giant killer, the dancer, the
[36:50] shoutter,
[36:52] the great victorious
[36:54] King David.
[36:57] Oh, you mean David felt like this?
[37:01] This is the other side of David. You
[37:03] see,
[37:05] fearfulness and trembling are come upon
[37:08] me, and horror,
[37:11] horror
[37:13] hath overwhelmed me.
[37:17] And I said, "Oh,
[37:20] that I had wings
[37:23] like a dove,
[37:25] for then
[37:27] would I fly away
[37:30] and be at rest."
[37:34] And I'd like to be remembered tonight as
[37:35] we pray.
[37:39] Lord Jesus,
[37:41] I imagine
[37:44] if these people, any of them have been
[37:46] serving you very long. They've
[37:48] experienced maybe not all these verses
[37:51] at one time,
[37:53] but at least some of them.
[37:56] Lord God, we're so thankful that you're
[37:59] mindful of us in such circumstances and
[38:03] events.
[38:05] Lord God, I pray that you would help us
[38:07] tonight as we look into your word. We
[38:11] thank you for the opportunity that's
[38:13] been given to us, Lord, that we can be
[38:15] able to assemble ourselves together.
[38:17] It's one of the highlights of our lives
[38:21] to come together in the presence of God
[38:25] and with the saints of God together. And
[38:29] Lord, to hear your word as you bring it
[38:32] to us. I pray that you'd help me to get
[38:35] out of the way. Father, you see we have
[38:38] a lot of sickness going on. Different
[38:40] ones sick, Lord, and can't be here. And
[38:43] we pray that you'd be mindful of them.
[38:46] Lord, you see
[38:48] our brother Steve Newsome was called
[38:51] away and Lord God, we're praying for his
[38:54] family and for the church family.
[38:57] Father, that you would just help each of
[38:59] us. We certainly do not mourn and don't
[39:03] feel bad for him. Why Why should we
[39:07] where he's gone to? But it's just our
[39:09] loss, Lord. So we pray that you'd help
[39:13] us tonight. You see, Sister Patty,
[39:16] Father Cooper, and if you don't move for
[39:19] her, Lord, it'll only be just a matter
[39:21] of days and she'll be gone as well. We
[39:25] know it's part of life. We know it,
[39:27] Lord.
[39:28] And we realize until you come, this is
[39:32] the cycle that we're in. And Lord, Carol
[39:35] and I had the funeral at Greenville on
[39:39] Monday morning, come home straight away,
[39:42] changed our clothes, went to the
[39:44] hospital, and then brother Steve passed
[39:47] later in the evening. As I sat there,
[39:51] dear God, by his bed,
[39:55] and I said it within myself, death,
[39:59] I hate you.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; I hate you with everything that's in me.
[40:07] But yet at the same time, I had to come
[40:11] back and quote what the prophet said.
[40:14] Thank God for the open door called
[40:19] death.
[40:20] What would it be if we laid in a
[40:22] miserable condition like we've seen many
[40:25] of our friends and loved ones maybe for
[40:28] a week or a few days? What if they laid
[40:31] there for months or years
[40:34] on end?
[40:36] Lord God, we're longing and waiting when
[40:39] there will be no more deaths.
[40:41] We believe you send your word to prepare
[40:44] us, Father, to make us ready. Speak to
[40:47] us tonight, Lord God. We ask in the name
[40:50] of Jesus.
[40:52] I want to speak to you tonight on
[40:56] battle
[40:58] fatigue
[41:00] syndrome.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[41:03] &gt;&gt; you can be seated.
[41:07] Battle fatigue
[41:10] syndrome.
[41:13] Let me read to you now what it means.
[41:16] Battle fatigue syndrome, also known as
[41:19] combat fatigue or battle fatigue,
[41:25] refers to a range of psychological
[41:29] and physical symptoms
[41:32] that arise from the intense stress and
[41:37] trauma experienced
[41:40] during combat.
[41:43] This condition is often characterized by
[41:46] emotional symptoms,
[41:49] irritability,
[41:52] anxiety,
[41:54] mood swings,
[41:56] feelings of sadness
[42:00] or hopelessness.
[42:02] Physical symptoms, fatigue,
[42:05] headache,
[42:07] sleep disturbances,
[42:09] changes in appetite,
[42:12] cognitive symptoms, difficulty
[42:14] concentrating,
[42:16] indecision, and a sense of disconnection
[42:21] from surroundings.
[42:25] Now, what struck me today whenever I was
[42:27] reading this article from the Jerusalem
[42:29] Post was that
[42:32] Israel is going into what they're saying
[42:35] will be their last phase of the war
[42:38] which started in October the 7th going
[42:41] on two years now.
[42:44] and they've rotated their reservist and
[42:48] they've rotated different soldiers and
[42:51] so that they could give them a break to
[42:53] go back to their family. And they're
[42:56] saying that many of their IDF, Israeli
[43:00] Defense Forces, their soldiers, that
[43:03] they're having a really hard time with
[43:07] with this uh symptoms and dealing with
[43:11] all of this because of over and over and
[43:15] day in and day out. not just in the
[43:19] battle but dealing with their image in
[43:23] the way the majority of the world looks
[43:26] at them. So Israel has very unfair
[43:31] requirements that's required of them by
[43:35] the UN and by the majority of the world.
[43:39] You see the world requires of Israel
[43:42] that they feed their enemies. the world
[43:46] requires of Israel different standards.
[43:50] It's always a different standard for
[43:52] Israel versus anybody else. They're not
[43:56] requiring that of Putin. They are not
[43:59] requiring that of the Houthis and Yemen.
[44:03] They did not require that of Iran. They
[44:06] didn't require it of America. They
[44:09] didn't require it of Afghanistan or of
[44:13] Iraq, of Korea or Vietnam. On and on and
[44:18] on I could go. But they do require it of
[44:21] Israel. So we have people in our nation
[44:25] then that are protesting wearing
[44:29] Palestinian flags,
[44:32] Hamas flags, flags of Mexico, flags of
[44:38] Venezuela,
[44:40] flags of Honduras,
[44:43] flags of Brazil, flags of Chile. My
[44:48] opinion is whatever flag they're
[44:51] wearing, they should send them there.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; If they like that better, adios, amigos.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Need help with the tickets? I'll donate
[45:01] the first thousand.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Anybody here willing to give 5, 10, 15,
[45:07] 20? All right, we done bought a few
[45:08] tickets already here tonight.
[45:11] But you can imagine now if you are
[45:13] Israel and you're you're you're losing
[45:16] your people, you've you've some of them
[45:18] have lost legs from IUD. Some of them
[45:22] have lost eyes. Some of them have lost
[45:25] arms. Some of them have lost all kinds
[45:28] of different things. And then they're
[45:30] constantly being under this onslaught of
[45:34] the media worldwide around the world
[45:37] every day of their life. You can imagine
[45:39] how difficult that it would be. So
[45:42] they're dealing with this battle related
[45:46] syndrome that their soldiers are having
[45:49] a hard time finding a real drive to get
[45:54] back into the battle because they're
[45:56] dealing with battle fatigue syndrome.
[46:00] And as I read that, I don't know how to
[46:02] explain to you how inspiration works,
[46:04] but just for a moment, it's like I just
[46:07] saw it right before me that here these
[46:11] are some of the greatest soldiers and
[46:13] they have the greatest army by the help
[46:16] of America with a lot of it. I I'll I'll
[46:18] have to say that and be honest with the
[46:20] military that they have and they can
[46:22] have the greatest successes of any army
[46:25] just about this in the world. But here
[46:28] are some of the greatest trained, the
[46:30] greatest military, the greatest
[46:32] generals, and yet they're finding
[46:35] themselves dealing with this battle
[46:38] fatigue to where they're having a hard
[46:41] time to want to get back into the battle
[46:44] and thinking, "What's the use?" I don't
[46:47] know if any of you saw it or not, but uh
[46:49] Hamas released just a week or two ago
[46:53] one of the hostages and the poor guy was
[46:56] nothing but just skin stretched over
[46:58] bones and they gave him a little old can
[47:01] of beans or something like that. How
[47:03] many actually saw that on YouTube?
[47:04] Anybody already know about? All right.
[47:06] So, they showed a picture of this guy
[47:08] and he was absolutely pitiful. So they
[47:11] gave him this can of beans and a bottle
[47:13] of water and that was to last him two to
[47:16] three days just depending on what they
[47:18] said, you know, and they could change it
[47:20] at any time. And they also brought him a
[47:22] shovel. He's inside of one of these
[47:25] tunnels in Gaza. And they demanded of
[47:28] him that he he's lost about 40% of his
[47:31] body weight, of his muscle mass,
[47:33] everything. and they demanded of him
[47:36] that he start digging his grave because
[47:39] they're planning on killing him.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; But now the world looks at that and the
[47:45] world thinks it's okay.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Do you understand, friends, what we're
[47:52] looking at? Pre-tribulation
[47:56] anointing.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The anointing of the sixth seal of
[48:00] the antichrist that will change the
[48:03] morning of the rapture will change
[48:06] everything. By noon, the world will be a
[48:10] different world than what anyone has
[48:12] ever seen. By the 6:00 news on the day
[48:17] of the rapture, Satan will have already
[48:20] moved. He will not have one day, Harry,
[48:22] not one day to lose. He's already moving
[48:26] in the background tonight. The mechanics
[48:30] of Satan's agenda are already here. The
[48:34] people protesting in Portland, Oregon,
[48:38] the people protesting in Los Angeles,
[48:42] the people protesting in San Fran, and
[48:45] in the different leftist people all over
[48:49] our nation are already moved under the
[48:52] anointing of the sixth seal. It's
[48:55] already here.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; It's already here to kill the Jews. And
[49:02] yet they say from the river to the sea.
[49:04] But whenever the reporters ask them what
[49:06] does that even mean? They don't have an
[49:09] idea. Well, let me tell you what it
[49:10] means. It means there want to annihilate
[49:14] every Jew. It is the charter of Hamas
[49:19] that they will not be one of them left
[49:22] as long as there's a Jew left alive.
[49:25] It's the charter of the infantada to
[49:28] kill and annihilate every one of them.
[49:31] And we have American citizens that are
[49:34] saying that's what needs to happen.
[49:36] Don't you understand? The same spirit
[49:39] that was here in the 40s that Hitler
[49:43] spearheaded is now being spearheaded on
[49:47] our universities and our campuses. Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; And under freedom of speech. Now, if I
[49:55] say anything from this pull pit that the
[49:57] media don't like, they'll crucify me.
[50:01] They'll call my name and my picture will
[50:04] be on every major thing. We've done been
[50:07] through that. We know what it is.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Because and they twist our words and do
[50:13] this and that and the other. And yet
[50:15] they will do everything they can to try
[50:18] to destroy you. And known Jew haters,
[50:22] they will let them live and won't even
[50:24] show pictures of truth and reality. Why?
[50:28] They can't help it. They're under that
[50:31] destructive anointing.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; But let me just tell hell tonight,
[50:38] you cannot destroy God's bride.
[50:42] Neither can you destroy God's 144,000.
[50:48] I don't care how much you hate him, how
[50:50] much you dislike him, you'll never be
[50:52] able to do it till God says you can.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[51:00] &gt;&gt; but you imagine that you're dealing with
[51:02] the psychological battle and you're
[51:05] dealing with fighting and knowing the
[51:08] whole world is against you. You look at
[51:11] your comrades. They've lost hands, arms,
[51:14] eyes. They've lost legs. They've lost
[51:16] all kinds of things. For what? For what?
[51:20] When the majority of the world hates
[51:22] you. And they are surrounded on every
[51:26] side by the Arabs on every side. And
[51:28] then their number one ally, the United
[51:31] States of America. And they know all it
[51:34] takes is one presidential election. and
[51:37] it's turned totally around again. I
[51:40] don't care how much Trump does for them.
[51:42] I don't care how much the Republicans
[51:44] and the Congress and the Republicans in
[51:46] the Senate, once it flips, it'll go
[51:49] right back the way it was going before.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; It makes no difference to me where
[51:55] you're a Democrat or a Republican or you
[51:58] don't even vote. Satan controls both
[52:01] sides of the aisle. And I'll tell you
[52:04] one thing, there's only one head that's
[52:07] ever going to bring peace on this earth.
[52:10] And it ain't Trump. And it ain't the
[52:12] Democrats. And it ain't the liberals.
[52:15] And it ain't Hamas. It's King Jesus.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; I said it's King Jesus.
[52:22] But now, let me not take all of my time
[52:26] just on that, but to bring it across to
[52:30] where we would see when we look around
[52:34] that as the people of God, we are
[52:36] experiencing battles like never before.
[52:40] We're under things like most of us have
[52:43] never been under in our lives. Some of
[52:46] us from our children, some from our
[52:48] grandchildren, some from ranks inside
[52:52] our own ranks, some from the outside of
[52:56] persecuting and bringing charges against
[52:59] the message and the messenger. And yet
[53:03] we know that it must come. And if we're
[53:06] not careful, we will get under this
[53:09] battle syndrome to where we lose our
[53:13] desire to fight. And we not only lose
[53:17] our desire to fight, but even more
[53:20] importantly than that, we lose our
[53:22] desire to praise. And I'm going to tell
[53:25] you tonight, there's one way that you're
[53:28] going to be able to maintain your desire
[53:31] to fight. and that is that you equally
[53:34] understand that you must always keep
[53:38] your desire to praise God. Not just
[53:41] praise him when you feel like it, but
[53:43] praise him when you don't. You don't
[53:46] just praise him when you understand what
[53:48] God does, but you praise him when you
[53:51] don't understand what God does. You
[53:54] praise him whenever you're able to
[53:56] comprehend his will. and you praise him.
[53:59] May I say even more so when you don't
[54:02] comprehend his will. Now that takes real
[54:06] victory.
[54:08] Now I want you to notice again in Psalm
[54:10] 69:1 that David said to the chief
[54:13] musician upon Shash Hanim. Now don't you
[54:17] notice different location alto together.
[54:20] A psalm of David, save me, oh God, for
[54:24] the waters are come into my soul. I sink
[54:27] in deep mire where there is no standing.
[54:31] I am come into deep waters where the
[54:34] floods overflow me. I am weary of my
[54:38] crying. My throat is dried. My eyes fail
[54:44] when I wait for my God. They that hate
[54:48] me without a cause are more than the
[54:51] hairs of mine head. They that would
[54:54] destroy me, being my enemies wrongfully,
[54:58] are mighty. Then I restored that which I
[55:02] took not away. So to even make peace and
[55:07] find peace and resolve this situation
[55:11] that David was not even guilty of, they
[55:14] accused him of taking this and taking
[55:17] that and taking that. David said, "I
[55:20] never even took it, but I actually
[55:22] restored to the person." They said, "I
[55:25] took this and this. I never even took
[55:28] it, but I restored it to him. I thought
[55:31] it might bring a little bit of peace,
[55:34] but alas, it did not." Now, can you
[55:36] imagine the psalmist how he was in such
[55:39] a straight and he's trying to search and
[55:42] reach a place of peace in his own heart
[55:46] and be able to arrive to that thing with
[55:48] God. Now, remember, he's the great king
[55:51] by now and he's enjoyed great blessings
[55:54] of God. But the enemies have multiplied
[55:57] around him in such a place that they're
[56:00] robbing David of the joy of the very
[56:03] thing that he longed for for decades of
[56:06] his life. So the enemy, if he can't stop
[56:10] you from going and becoming what God
[56:13] wants you to be, then when you arrive in
[56:16] the plane where God has ordains you to
[56:19] walk, then the enemy will come and try
[56:22] to overwhelm you with so much stuff that
[56:26] it robs your joy of being what God
[56:29] ordained you to be.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you tonight, I get
[56:33] sick of that nonsense of the devil.
[56:36] You know, we we know that we certainly
[56:38] are not the first ones to ever go
[56:41] through these types of things. And I'm
[56:44] reminded as I I went whenever Carol and
[56:46] I come back home and I went downstairs
[56:48] to start studying. And I, as I said, I
[56:50] don't know how to explain it to you, but
[56:51] just all of a sudden, it was like the
[56:53] floodgates started opening up to me and
[56:56] the inspiration coming. It was coming
[56:58] faster than I could write it down. So, I
[57:00] just started putting down notes and
[57:01] notes and another note and another note
[57:03] and scriptures and quotes and it's just
[57:05] it's just like an explosion when it
[57:07] comes that way. And I was just praying,
[57:08] God, please help me to not miss it.
[57:10] Please help me. I wasn't asking him to
[57:11] slow down. It's asking me to speed up.
[57:13] Help me, Lord, that I can keep up with
[57:14] you. But as I begin to look at it and
[57:17] more and more of these characters of the
[57:20] scripture began to came to me, but one
[57:22] that so stuck out to my heart was
[57:25] Elijah. And the prophet tells us about
[57:27] Elijah. I tell you, Elijah and his
[57:30] nerves on edge anyhow. Always felt sorry
[57:32] for him. His nerves was about ready to
[57:35] break anyhow. And that great pound from
[57:38] Jezebel finished the stroke. Then he run
[57:41] and went into the wilderness and laid
[57:44] underneath the juniper tree. Oh, that
[57:47] experience of the juniper tree. Now,
[57:49] there's many of us find ourselves under
[57:52] the juniper tree. Now, what was Elijah
[57:54] experiencing? He was experiencing the
[57:57] title of my message tonight, battle
[58:01] fatigue syndrome. So now he had fought
[58:04] against the prophets. He had killed the
[58:07] prophets. He had stood up and prophesied
[58:09] of the word. And now he's at the
[58:12] breaking point. And we know that the
[58:14] prophet took this and he broke it down
[58:17] and said that actually Elijah wound up
[58:19] having a nervous breakdown. So he comes
[58:22] and he identified three stages of where
[58:25] Elijah was. Now watch he said he run and
[58:28] went into the wilderness and laid under
[58:30] the juniper tree. All that experience
[58:33] under the juniper tree. There's many of
[58:35] us find ourselves under the juniper
[58:38] tree. I get myself under there many
[58:40] times to a place that you don't know
[58:44] what to do. You're frustrated. Frankly,
[58:48] I'm right under it right now. I want you
[58:51] to notice this year, 1959. I'm right
[58:54] under it right now. If you notice,
[58:56] Brother Brandham, he goes through it in
[58:58] different years of his life. He's 156.
[59:02] He's in 159, back in 61, end of 62,
[59:07] comes through it again, middle of 63.
[59:09] And you notice he comes to the juniper
[59:12] tree time and time again. So, it's not a
[59:15] one-time experience. Why would it be
[59:17] that way? because the battlefield
[59:20] fatigue so builds up on a real true
[59:24] soldier. Now, this does not apply to
[59:27] recliner Christians. It does not apply
[59:31] to Christians that are not even in the
[59:33] battlefield. People that don't even see
[59:35] the need of going to church. They just
[59:37] stay home and press play. So, they don't
[59:40] have a clue as to what we are talking
[59:43] about. And the church said,
[59:44] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[59:45] Notice he said, "You know, people under
[59:47] the jour juniper tree is like Elijah.
[59:51] They like to sleep. I preach to more
[59:54] tired people than anybody in the world."
[59:58] People so tired they they're so mentally
[1:00:01] strained until they're filling the
[1:00:03] insane institutions. If he would have
[1:00:05] said that in 1959, Lord have mercy. What
[1:00:09] would he say in 2025?
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; My goodness. filling the insane
[1:00:14] institutions in 1959. Of course, of now,
[1:00:18] we got insane people treating the insane
[1:00:21] people. Oh my. Well, that's that's
[1:00:23] exactly the truth. Notice they're in
[1:00:25] such a condition till they don't know
[1:00:27] what they do believe and what they want.
[1:00:30] Now, you talking about a mess. Whenever
[1:00:33] a person gets to a spot that they don't
[1:00:36] know what they do believe, so they do
[1:00:38] believe it, but they don't know what
[1:00:40] they do believe. Wow. I mean, that is
[1:00:43] far out. They don't they do believe
[1:00:45] something, but they don't even know what
[1:00:47] they do believe. And then they're at the
[1:00:50] spot also to where they don't know what
[1:00:53] they want. So, they're looking for
[1:00:55] happiness. They're searching. They're
[1:00:57] looking. So, they tried drinking. They
[1:00:59] tried this drug. Then, a new drug comes
[1:01:01] out and they try it. And that don't
[1:01:02] bring them to that high. So, they mix
[1:01:04] that drug with another drug. And then
[1:01:06] they mix that one with this one. And
[1:01:08] why? Because there's something in them.
[1:01:09] They're longing. Let me tell you
[1:01:11] something, friend. The worst day in your
[1:01:13] life as a Holy Ghost fil Christian is
[1:01:16] greater than the best day a sinner ever
[1:01:18] has. Any day out of the week, seven days
[1:01:21] a week, 365 days a year, and even on
[1:01:24] leap here, 24 hours a day, the worst day
[1:01:27] you have in your life is better than a
[1:01:29] sinner will ever have his entire life.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Now, notice he said they're just laying
[1:01:35] there. They don't know what to do. And
[1:01:38] it's a sad sight. There he laid under
[1:01:42] the juniper tree. He didn't know what to
[1:01:44] do. His nerves was broke. He was
[1:01:47] shaking. Listen to great Elijah. He was
[1:01:50] shaking. He was crying. No doubt he was
[1:01:53] in a terrible. We're talking about a
[1:01:57] prophet, a false prophet killer.
[1:02:00] We're talking about a man that could
[1:02:02] stand there and call fire out of heaven
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; and then turn right around and watch God
[1:02:08] come of the mighty vindication of his
[1:02:10] presence and stop the rain, said, "It
[1:02:13] ain't going to rain till I call for it."
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; And now this man, what would you have
[1:02:19] thought if you would have run up on the
[1:02:20] juniper tree and seen him sitting there
[1:02:23] shaking and quivering and he didn't even
[1:02:25] know what to do and maybe screaming all
[1:02:27] Lord have mercy? What in the world's
[1:02:29] wrong with him? He's got the conditions
[1:02:32] of battlefield syndrome.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; He don't know what to do. He don't know
[1:02:37] where he's at. He thinks he's the only
[1:02:39] one left.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; You see, when some of our message
[1:02:43] preachers and message churches go to
[1:02:45] preaching that is about them and two,
[1:02:47] three more churches are the only one
[1:02:49] that's the bride. They've got
[1:02:51] battlefield syndrome.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; They don't know who they are. They get
[1:02:54] in that spirit like Elijah. That is not
[1:02:57] a complimentary trait to have.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice there he laid under the
[1:03:05] juniper tree, didn't know what to do.
[1:03:07] His nerves was broke, shaking. He was
[1:03:09] crying, no doubt, and a terrible
[1:03:11] condition. Many of us hit those places,
[1:03:14] especially after a Mount Carmel
[1:03:18] experience.
[1:03:21] God has to do something for every man
[1:03:24] that comes under the juniper tree or
[1:03:26] he'll go to pieces. He has to do. Oh
[1:03:30] Lord, he has to do it. If his servants
[1:03:34] laying under the tree under don't you
[1:03:36] know what to do? He's carried out his
[1:03:38] commission. Elijah said, "Oh Lord, let
[1:03:41] me die."
[1:03:43] My goodness, I've had those feelings
[1:03:46] after I come out of a meeting and look
[1:03:48] like I've tried and preached and begged
[1:03:51] and persuaded and seen the angel of God
[1:03:54] sweep through a meeting and do signs and
[1:03:56] wonders and sat in a car on the outside
[1:03:59] and hear him cry and say it was nothing
[1:04:01] but psychology.
[1:04:04] You understand what brother Brandham was
[1:04:06] feeling whenever he would hear these
[1:04:07] reports or read it in a newspaper
[1:04:09] article or hear one of his best friends
[1:04:12] say it. And Satan will always make sure
[1:04:14] you hear them comments.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Satan will try his best to keep
[1:04:18] testimonies away from you. But he'll
[1:04:20] just certainly certainly make sure you
[1:04:22] hear complaints, griping, groaning, and
[1:04:25] complaining and going on and on and on.
[1:04:28] Praise the Lord. Sure does. That's just
[1:04:29] the way that he does it. But you imagine
[1:04:32] now the prophet he said and you hear it
[1:04:35] and it was nothing but psychology. There
[1:04:37] was nothing to it. Nothing to that. It's
[1:04:40] all nonsense. Oh then I crawled under
[1:04:43] the juniper tree and I think Lord why
[1:04:45] did you let me do it for? What can it be
[1:04:48] done? But we all hit these experiences
[1:04:50] but the mercy of Jehovah to his servant.
[1:04:53] God knows your trials. Somebody ought to
[1:04:55] be saying amen. God knows your trials.
[1:04:58] Just know this. He knows all about it.
[1:05:03] But I'm glad to tell you tonight,
[1:05:04] friends, if you're there, God has got a
[1:05:07] juniper tree for you. And God has also
[1:05:10] still got angels. You remember under
[1:05:12] that juniper tree, don't you? And the
[1:05:14] prophet of God said that God said to his
[1:05:17] angel, I want you to that the angel with
[1:05:20] the softest hand, I want you to go down
[1:05:22] there and start caressing the brow. Oh,
[1:05:24] I feel like having church tonight. I
[1:05:27] want the angel with the softest hand to
[1:05:29] go down there and start caressing the
[1:05:31] brow of my servant. You imagine that
[1:05:33] prophet as he woke up and then God sent
[1:05:36] the best cook out of the angelic band
[1:05:39] down there and he started making a
[1:05:40] little bit of ho cakes and on the fire.
[1:05:42] My my oh Elijah they had to wake him up
[1:05:45] maybe shaking quivering tore all the
[1:05:48] pieces. What was it? I don't feel
[1:05:50] fatigued. He didn't feel like fighting
[1:05:52] no more. God said that's all right. You
[1:05:55] don't need to fight right now. You're my
[1:05:56] servant. You're my son. You've stood
[1:05:58] true. You've stood faithful. Your
[1:06:01] children have turned away. Your
[1:06:02] grandchildren's turned away. Your loved
[1:06:04] ones have turned away. But I'm here,
[1:06:07] child. I'm mindful of you, child.
[1:06:09] Somebody hear me tonight. I've sent down
[1:06:11] an angel with a salt hand. But you know
[1:06:14] what? If we're not careful, when we get
[1:06:15] so low, we will turn away God's mercy
[1:06:19] and his grace. God will anoint a servant
[1:06:22] to bring something to you that will
[1:06:24] encourage you and you just sat there
[1:06:26] like a bump on a pickle when you ought
[1:06:28] to be saying, "Thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:06:30] you, Lord." You sent an angel tonight
[1:06:33] with a soft hand to caress me, Lord. You
[1:06:36] sent an angel with a message, oh God,
[1:06:39] that would help me through this. Father,
[1:06:41] you see, I'm fatigued and I've got this
[1:06:43] syndrome. My emotions are all tore up,
[1:06:46] Lord. My imagination and everything
[1:06:49] about me is tore up. Jesus, I'm your
[1:06:51] bride. I know I'm your elected. I know.
[1:06:54] But Lord, I need help. It's not a shame,
[1:06:58] friends, when you wind up under the
[1:07:00] juniper tree. Just climb up there and
[1:07:03] lay down and let God send them angels
[1:07:06] down there to go to ministering to you.
[1:07:10] Hallelujah.
[1:07:13] Oh my. And today we see the institutions
[1:07:18] filled
[1:07:20] with the people
[1:07:23] of God.
[1:07:25] You see, Christians are not exempt from
[1:07:28] some of the exact same things everybody
[1:07:30] else out here deals with.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and look at me like
[1:07:34] y'all don't get nervous. Y'all don't get
[1:07:36] upset. Y'all don't get tore up. Y'all
[1:07:38] don't get down. You don't get weary.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:45] Oh my. Notice he says, "And today we see
[1:07:48] the institutions filled with people of
[1:07:50] God, nervous breakdowns, tensions. Oh,
[1:07:53] it makes us all want to run to the
[1:07:56] juniper tree." I think we could express
[1:07:58] it like the old colored lady said
[1:08:02] down south when she'd been hit by an
[1:08:05] automobile
[1:08:07] and a car had struck her and they asked
[1:08:09] her if she wanted to sue for damages.
[1:08:13] She said, "Lo, no, child. I don't need
[1:08:16] damage. I need repair."
[1:08:22] Oh, glory to God. I don't need damage. I
[1:08:26] need repair. Maybe some of y'all need to
[1:08:28] say that. Lousy know, child. I don't
[1:08:30] need no more damage. I need repair. How
[1:08:33] many feels like tonight's a good night
[1:08:35] to get repair? Let me tell you
[1:08:37] something. I'm heading you up to the
[1:08:39] greatest doctor that's ever been.
[1:08:41] Hallelujah. Dr. Jesus is here tonight.
[1:08:45] And if he diagnoses your case with
[1:08:48] battlefield fatigue, he can not only
[1:08:50] treat you, but he can heal you. He can
[1:08:53] deliver you. He can rub your brow. He
[1:08:56] can feed you with divine anointed word
[1:09:00] and give you strength to climb out from
[1:09:02] under that juniper tree and say, "Where
[1:09:04] is that devil? Where is that devil?"
[1:09:08] Hallelujah. And one moment you felt like
[1:09:11] dying, the next moment you feel like,
[1:09:13] "Glory to God, here I am. I'm ready to
[1:09:15] go. I'm fed. I'm rubbed. And I'm ready."
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Lousy know, child, I don't need damage.
[1:09:29] I need repair. I think that's about the
[1:09:32] way the church is tonight. A repair. the
[1:09:36] place under the juniper tree so we can
[1:09:40] be alone. I preach to tired people,
[1:09:44] nervous people. Pray for nervous people.
[1:09:47] And it's a nervous, neurotic,
[1:09:50] upset world right now that we're living
[1:09:53] in. Everybody's on the edge.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Can you imagine? As I
[1:09:59] said, what do you say if he was here and
[1:10:01] see road rage?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; That wasn't even in the vocabulary 1959.
[1:10:05] It's not been in yours that that long.
[1:10:07] The last few years, people pulling out
[1:10:09] guns, shooting at one another, doing
[1:10:11] this and that and the other. Everybody's
[1:10:12] living right on the edge. Is that true,
[1:10:14] church?
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Do you understand tonight? You think,
[1:10:17] "Oh, Lord, you know, I I ain't really
[1:10:19] that blessed. I ain't that blessed." How
[1:10:21] many's in your right mind tonight?
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; The rest of you insane.
[1:10:29] How many's in your right mind
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; and you're wanting to count your
[1:10:33] blessings?
[1:10:36] We're living in a crazy world.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; People's been saved,
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; but you got your right mind.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; How many loves Jesus with all your
[1:10:45] heart?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. How many's got a desire to serve
[1:10:48] him?
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Okay, you want to leave your hands up?
[1:10:50] Fine. How many's got a desire to go to
[1:10:52] heaven
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; in the first exit out, which is the
[1:10:55] rapture? How many loves Jesus and his
[1:10:57] word? How many loves the saints of God?
[1:11:00] How many wants to be ready on the
[1:11:02] rapture morning and you're wondering
[1:11:03] what you've got to praise him for? All
[1:11:05] them things ought to make you jump up
[1:11:07] and spin around in your chair and say,
[1:11:09] "I've got so much to thank him for. I am
[1:11:13] so blessed.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my, the insane institutions are
[1:11:23] filling up. The hospitals are filling
[1:11:25] up. Juvenile crime is on the rampage.
[1:11:29] And it wasn't nothing then compared to
[1:11:31] what it is now.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; We're living in a terrible time.
[1:11:37] Brother Tommy Hicks, I hear, is in a
[1:11:40] heart attack overworked.
[1:11:43] As I said the other night, God's people
[1:11:46] needs a juniper tree.
[1:11:50] Notice what he calls the juniper tree.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Rest.
[1:11:56] Yes, sir.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Now, don't ever one of you start pulling
[1:11:59] out your phone right now and making
[1:12:00] reservations down in Florida on Expedia
[1:12:03] for the next eight months.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Some of you just looking for an excuse
[1:12:07] to go on a trip anywhere. I ain't
[1:12:09] talking about you going to Dollywood. I
[1:12:12] ain't just talking about you going to
[1:12:13] Disney. I ain't just talking about you
[1:12:16] going to Six Flags or going here or
[1:12:18] there, there. I'm talking about entering
[1:12:20] into a place in Christ Jesus.
[1:12:24] Oh, sure you might get a little bit of
[1:12:26] benefit by getting away from your job
[1:12:28] and your work and so on. I hear there's
[1:12:30] of a thing called vacation. I never had
[1:12:32] too many of my life, but I hear there is
[1:12:34] such a thing. But I'm laying mine out
[1:12:37] for long term after a while. Uhhuh. But
[1:12:40] you know what? You can go and be gone
[1:12:42] every week somewhere. But if you never
[1:12:44] enter that place spiritually, you still
[1:12:47] don't have what I'm talking about
[1:12:48] tonight. But it's something down inside
[1:12:51] your soul. It don't make no difference
[1:12:53] what Satan does, what mama does, what
[1:12:56] daddy does, what your neighbor does. You
[1:12:58] have got a rest that's beyond you. It's
[1:13:01] beyond your mama. It's beyond your
[1:13:03] daddy. It's joy unspeakable and full of
[1:13:06] glory.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Let's just wait on the Lord.
[1:13:16] Then we renew our strength as we wait on
[1:13:20] him. Don't try to do it all.
[1:13:25] I remember staying on the prayer line
[1:13:27] for seven days and nights,
[1:13:30] eating my meals at the pulpit,
[1:13:34] determined I would pray for everyone
[1:13:36] that come before I sat down.
[1:13:39] There were 10 times more on the last
[1:13:41] night than there was when I started.
[1:13:44] Then I almost died.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:49] I couldn't sleep. Didn't know where I
[1:13:52] was at hardly.
[1:13:54] I was so tired and weary.
[1:13:58] Doesn't pay to do that. Jesus
[1:14:01] doesn't want us to do that. He wants us
[1:14:06] to take care of ourselves.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Now you realize Jesus won't do this
[1:14:11] part.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus won't take care of myself.
[1:14:17] Jesus won't take care of yourself.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; So you know whose responsibility it is?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; You.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Whose responsibility is it for me?
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Me.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; But you imagine now some of you brothers
[1:14:33] that are painters and this and that and
[1:14:35] you have to go go. No, I ain't I ain't
[1:14:36] coming. Nope. No. You imagine how hard
[1:14:39] it is for a preacher
[1:14:42] church of our size. Sickness never
[1:14:44] stops.
[1:14:46] deaths, hospital visits, funerals,
[1:14:50] never stops.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Imagine how hard it is for me and my
[1:14:56] wife to find any kind of time to rest.
[1:15:00] And even if I do go somewhere and I
[1:15:02] carry that box in my pocket off the tree
[1:15:05] of knowledge of good and evil.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And Satan loves nothing better than if
[1:15:13] he can't stop sons of God and men of God
[1:15:16] from preaching and laboring cause them
[1:15:19] to overwork themsel.
[1:15:25] So what will he do
[1:15:28] with all kinds of anxieties and
[1:15:31] troubles? And you see any pastor that
[1:15:33] really loves his people when they go
[1:15:36] through stuff, he goes through it,
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; which is the way it's supposed to be. So
[1:15:41] what does he do? Increases your trouble,
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; which is increasing mine
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; automatically.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Well, what am I supposed to do? Are we
[1:15:52] supposed to come to you? Yes, I'd be so
[1:15:54] offended if you didn't.
[1:15:56] But what do I need to do? What do you
[1:15:58] need to do? Somehow we got to figure out
[1:16:00] a place and all the duress and all the
[1:16:02] trouble to still find a, you know, a
[1:16:04] little bit way to visit under the
[1:16:06] juniper tree because if we don't, he
[1:16:08] will crack us up. He will absolutely
[1:16:12] wear you out with your children or your
[1:16:15] grandchildren or your neighbors or this
[1:16:17] doctrine in the message or that doctrine
[1:16:19] in the message. All a lot of it is is to
[1:16:22] try to stress out the bride to where the
[1:16:24] bride is so worried weary and worry has
[1:16:29] no virtue in it. Absolutely none.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; And some of you will say amen to that
[1:16:40] quote and walk right out them doors and
[1:16:42] worry the same amount you did before you
[1:16:45] come in. Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; So I guess it comes down, do we believe
[1:16:48] that quote or not?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Now sometimes when you go to visit a
[1:16:57] doctor, you know they have to give you
[1:16:58] shock therapy.
[1:17:04] Notice
[1:17:06] he says, "Some people think that God's
[1:17:09] prophets
[1:17:11] ought to continually be bombarding away
[1:17:13] all the time,
[1:17:15] but God wants them to come aside." You
[1:17:18] know, some of us eat and eat and never
[1:17:22] exercise.
[1:17:24] Others are overex exercised
[1:17:27] and don't get a chance to eat.
[1:17:31] We sat in these conventions and eat the
[1:17:34] word of God and the goodness of go of
[1:17:36] God and then go out sassy and fat.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; So that's what a convention can do for
[1:17:46] you or a youth camp or a banquet or
[1:17:49] whatever it is, a revival meeting. It
[1:17:52] can actually make you sassy and fat.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that an awesome quote? I wouldn't
[1:18:00] take that right there from nobody else
[1:18:02] except a vindicated prophet. I don't
[1:18:03] mind tell you that right now. I don't
[1:18:04] care how good the pastor was. I'd say I
[1:18:06] question that. I ain't questioning this.
[1:18:09] Then you go out sassy and fat and never
[1:18:14] say nothing about it. We should go out
[1:18:19] and use that energy and those
[1:18:23] testimonies to the glory of the Lord
[1:18:26] Jesus. You know, a lot of people think
[1:18:29] that a prophet ought to go out like a
[1:18:31] rocket.
[1:18:34] If he goes out like a rocket, he will
[1:18:36] soon fall like a rock.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Ain't that awesome? If he goes out
[1:18:42] like a rocket, he will soon fall like a
[1:18:45] rock. And remember Elijah, God in his
[1:18:49] mercy. Here come Elijah under the
[1:18:52] juniper tree. And he was able to visit
[1:18:55] the doctor's office
[1:18:57] and the doctor the doctor brought him a
[1:19:01] cure.
[1:19:03] Peculiar what God will use. For some
[1:19:07] it's a soft gentle hand.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; For others it's another hand turned
[1:19:12] around swatting them where they sat
[1:19:13] down. Wham wham.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz they become numb, desensitized.
[1:19:20] They don't need another soft hand on
[1:19:22] their brow. just puts them into deeper
[1:19:24] sleep, but they need a gospel spanking
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; to kind of get them out of that old
[1:19:29] layer of the sea of coldness, you know.
[1:19:31] Oh my, you know, as as the eagle does
[1:19:33] whenever he goes to developing on this
[1:19:35] stage of his life and he goes up in the
[1:19:37] mountain and he goes beating his his
[1:19:40] beak and beating it and beating it in
[1:19:42] order to get that crust off of him
[1:19:44] because he's getting into that stage of
[1:19:46] molting and he has to really put himself
[1:19:49] through a difficult time. But when he
[1:19:51] comes out, he renews his youth.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we need a revan.
[1:19:56] Sometimes we need a beat beating.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, you imagine John the Baptist church
[1:20:04] as he gets into that time that he's done
[1:20:06] what God commissioned him to do. But the
[1:20:09] prophet said John his eyes, the prophet
[1:20:11] John was kindly filmed over. He was had
[1:20:14] the spirit of Elijah. And Elijah had a
[1:20:16] breakdown when he was under the juniper
[1:20:18] tree. And John had a breakdown in the
[1:20:21] prison. So how would you have accepted
[1:20:22] that in your day? The prophet messenger
[1:20:24] of your day had a nervous breakdown and
[1:20:28] was now questioning his own message. So
[1:20:31] he sends two disciples and say, "Are you
[1:20:33] the one that we're supposed to look
[1:20:35] for?" John's not really sure. He's
[1:20:38] really tore up now. He's he's afraid
[1:20:39] that he's missed it somehow. Can you
[1:20:42] imagine? And Jesus didn't rebuke him.
[1:20:44] Just Jesus didn't say send him a message
[1:20:46] back and tell him I am so ashamed of
[1:20:48] him. I cannot believe that he would do
[1:20:51] this. He introduced me and now he's even
[1:20:54] questioning whether I'm the word or not.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; He knows how to deal with this, don't
[1:20:59] he?
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He was a highpitched prophet them
[1:21:05] nerves on edge and his eagle eye filmed
[1:21:08] over. He said, "Go see if I have been
[1:21:11] wrong." questioning his own message from
[1:21:14] God.
[1:21:16] What happened to him? Battlefront
[1:21:19] syndrome.
[1:21:21] He just saw beside himself. Oh God, I've
[1:21:24] missed it. I've missed it. Now this is
[1:21:27] the end of my ministry. I've introduced
[1:21:29] the wrong man. You said, "Why would he
[1:21:31] do that, Brother Donn?" He said,
[1:21:32] "There's one among you. I'll tell you
[1:21:34] one thing. He's going to do this and
[1:21:35] that and the other." Glory to God. John
[1:21:37] had in his mind what he was going to do.
[1:21:39] Jesus come along just being pushed
[1:21:40] around by the world. They laughed at
[1:21:42] him. They made fun of him. He said this
[1:21:43] is I'll tell you one thing. His fan is
[1:21:45] in his hand. He's thoroughly purging the
[1:21:47] floor. And John must have thought,
[1:21:48] "Glory to God, he's coming. He'll turn
[1:21:50] them Romans upside down."
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And when he heard what Jesus was doing,
[1:21:55] he said, "Oh no,
[1:21:58] I've missed it.
[1:22:01] I've missed it. I've I've introduced
[1:22:04] the wrong man.
[1:22:07] My ministry is ruined.
[1:22:10] I made a horrible mistake. So he says,
[1:22:12] "Boys, go down and ask him, are you sure
[1:22:16] you want us to aren't you afraid they'll
[1:22:17] embarrass you?" I can't help it. I've
[1:22:20] got to have an answer.
[1:22:23] Praise God. I don't know about you, I'm
[1:22:26] glad when we get in these spots, Jesus
[1:22:29] is still merciful.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; I heard a song today. I was over here at
[1:22:32] the church doing some work this morning
[1:22:34] and I heard a song as I started back
[1:22:36] home and it was it was the title of it a
[1:22:39] million a million reasons and they start
[1:22:42] out whoever it was wrote it they started
[1:22:44] out you know I'm this and I'm falling
[1:22:46] shortcomings and I'm this and that and
[1:22:48] the other and they said I've given Jesus
[1:22:51] at least a million reasons why he
[1:22:53] shouldn't love me but he comes back
[1:22:56] every time and says I still love you the
[1:22:58] same I thought praise be to God. Maybe I
[1:23:02] haven't given him a million, but I've
[1:23:03] surely given him a lot of them. Aren't
[1:23:05] you glad our mistakes and our juniper
[1:23:07] trees don't change how much he loves us?
[1:23:09] Now, it will people
[1:23:12] find out you're going through something
[1:23:13] tough in your life. Well, my goodness, I
[1:23:15] thought you stronger than that. I sure
[1:23:17] never thought you'd ever get sick. You
[1:23:19] mean to tell me you're taking aspirin?
[1:23:21] Lord have mercy. I can't believe you
[1:23:23] take Tylenol for pain. I can't believe
[1:23:26] it. I thank God for everything science
[1:23:28] has done to bring pain relief. I don't
[1:23:31] need much of it myself so far. But I'll
[1:23:32] tell you one thing. I've seen enough of
[1:23:34] the children of God suffer. I'm grateful
[1:23:36] for what they can do to help us through
[1:23:38] the hard times of life. Not only the
[1:23:40] natural painkiller, but I'm talking
[1:23:42] about the spiritual one, the word.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; You imagine the Lord Jesus getting
[1:23:48] weary. The prophet said it this way. How
[1:23:49] can a man stand there tired and weary,
[1:23:54] dust all over him from his journey and
[1:23:57] say, "Lazarus,
[1:23:59] come for." And we might think, man, he
[1:24:02] stood there like a a Julius Caesar or an
[1:24:05] Alexander the Great or a Tommy of Egypt.
[1:24:09] But if we would have looked at Jesus and
[1:24:11] probably been sweaty and tired and
[1:24:13] sweat, you know, and the dust clinging
[1:24:15] to his body and maybe have to stand up
[1:24:17] and kind
[1:24:26] as us
[1:24:29] come forth.
[1:24:32] Them devils down here say, "Are you
[1:24:34] kidding me?
[1:24:37] We've heard Pharaoh say stuff. We've
[1:24:39] heard this man stands up and that little
[1:24:42] puny weak guy standing up there weary
[1:24:46] tired and he's going to say something
[1:24:48] and all of a sudden and the prophet of
[1:24:51] God tells us if he had not called
[1:24:52] Lazarus name the general resurrection
[1:24:55] would have took place right then cuz he
[1:24:57] had power not only over Lazarus but all
[1:24:59] the rest of them.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; But how did he despict himself? Not as a
[1:25:04] great gladiator, not as a man who would
[1:25:07] stand around and his muscles bumping up
[1:25:09] and all that sort of thing, but a weak,
[1:25:12] puny, frail human being.
[1:25:20] You imagine, he said he lived and talked
[1:25:22] to need. How can a man that could call
[1:25:24] the dead to life hang younger at the
[1:25:26] cross? Cruy marked, made fun of, spit
[1:25:28] on, hanging there, great big spit
[1:25:31] hanging on his face, thorns on his head,
[1:25:35] and scream for mercy.
[1:25:38] You imagine a kid, much less God
[1:25:43] that
[1:25:46] spit on his face and that spit running
[1:25:48] down his face,
[1:25:51] a general, a god.
[1:25:57] Lord God and scream for mercy. My God.
[1:26:02] My God.
[1:26:06] Imagine his screams and cries that day
[1:26:09] would have broke the heart of near the
[1:26:11] hardestarted sinner that would have
[1:26:13] standing there. It must have been so
[1:26:15] pitiful. Hey Harry, because he was a
[1:26:18] dying lamb. It was not an actress. He
[1:26:22] was not a Hollywood actor.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; It was dying in shame and weakness
[1:26:32] hanging on his juniper tree.
[1:26:37] Now remember it was a cedar tree as far
[1:26:39] as the wood, but I'm talking about
[1:26:40] spiritual metaphor
[1:26:43] hanging on his tree. But instead of
[1:26:45] getting an angel with a soft hand,
[1:26:49] instead of getting fresh bread, the
[1:26:50] angels turned.
[1:26:53] Father God turned his back on him.
[1:26:57] Lord God,
[1:26:59] again, he says, "Now tired and weary, he
[1:27:02] goes back and takes this opportunity for
[1:27:05] a little rest while the ship is crossing
[1:27:09] the sea."
[1:27:11] I wonder how many times Jesus got so
[1:27:14] weary.
[1:27:15] Let me hurry and bring it on down. Watch
[1:27:18] the prophet as he shares a few things
[1:27:20] about himself.
[1:27:22] He's hung out whenever he got so tired
[1:27:24] out discerning and praying for the
[1:27:26] people and stuff. And he said, "I woke
[1:27:27] up and I'd stopped and I couldn't get to
[1:27:32] myself
[1:27:34] and I had my hands out the window
[1:27:38] and I was in a cow pasture."
[1:27:42] And this is after he leaves the meetings
[1:27:43] in Arkansas.
[1:27:45] He runs off the road into a cow pastor
[1:27:50] and he has his hands stretched out of
[1:27:52] his truck window. And I had my hands out
[1:27:55] the window saying, "Only believe,
[1:27:57] sister. That's the only thing you have
[1:28:00] to do. Just believe."
[1:28:03] And I said, "What's the matter with me?"
[1:28:07] I got out. I done run off the road out
[1:28:09] into a cow pastor sleep on the road. And
[1:28:12] I come home and oh my when I got home
[1:28:14] there was before we kept the people from
[1:28:17] the house and it was lined up 150 to 200
[1:28:21] of them. Now you imagine he leaves that
[1:28:23] meeting and when he gets home he's got
[1:28:25] people lined up the street at his house
[1:28:29] 150 to 200.
[1:28:32] I don't blame him.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; I would have been there too.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; You come in and you're so weary you'll
[1:28:44] hardly know where you're at. I woke up
[1:28:47] here not long ago
[1:28:49] right out in the middle of the floor
[1:28:52] holding a pillow in my arms saying only
[1:28:56] believe brother that's the only thing
[1:28:59] you have to do is just believe. My wife
[1:29:01] woke me up I was out on the floor so tor
[1:29:04] up you know and tired and I just
[1:29:05] couldn't go any farther and I had this
[1:29:07] pill in my hand said now just believe
[1:29:09] brother that's all you had to do. Oh I
[1:29:11] don't know it gets pretty rough. See,
[1:29:13] but what it is, I'm trying to do
[1:29:15] something for him and I want to
[1:29:18] represent him
[1:29:20] to the people.
[1:29:24] Oh Lord,
[1:29:26] I wonder how many times for our sake he
[1:29:30] wound up under that juniper tree and
[1:29:31] nearly died.
[1:29:34] He gives other examples about himself
[1:29:36] being under the juniper tree. One of
[1:29:38] them, of course, was his wife and his
[1:29:39] baby.
[1:29:41] Notice the guys on the road to Emmus and
[1:29:44] he said they went along the road saying
[1:29:46] well I guess life is not worth living.
[1:29:52] We believe that he was the Messiah. Can
[1:29:55] you imagine now Peter, James, John went
[1:29:57] back to fishing and the guys to Emmas
[1:30:00] they was going back home wherever they
[1:30:02] come from and they thought we've been
[1:30:05] deceived. We've been tricked. This
[1:30:07] Jesus, we thought he was the Messiah,
[1:30:09] but now the man's dead.
[1:30:12] All of our hopes was tied in this one
[1:30:14] man.
[1:30:16] Oh, praise God. But he found him in the
[1:30:19] way. Oh, we believed it was the Messiah.
[1:30:22] How could that man that raised from the
[1:30:24] dead ever stand there and let the high
[1:30:25] priest make fun of him? How could that
[1:30:28] man who could see vision after vision
[1:30:29] ever let a Roman soldier put a rag
[1:30:31] around his face, hit him on the head,
[1:30:33] and say, "If thou be a prophet, tell us
[1:30:35] who hit you." How could he scream for
[1:30:37] mercy
[1:30:39] on the cross
[1:30:42] seeing that he could raise up the dead?
[1:30:44] Oh, it was a discouraging
[1:30:48] moment.
[1:30:50] And those discouraging times comes to
[1:30:53] every believer
[1:30:55] to test you, to try you, to see if you
[1:31:00] really do believe. Every son that cometh
[1:31:04] to God must first be tested child
[1:31:06] training. And there'll be some of you
[1:31:08] here tonight, no doubt, will go through
[1:31:10] that same testing.
[1:31:14] And I can see from some of the
[1:31:15] expressions on the faces of my patients
[1:31:19] tonight. Now, you see, I also am a
[1:31:21] doctor. That's my initials. Dr. Donny
[1:31:24] Reagan.
[1:31:31] Some of you
[1:31:33] are sick with this syndrome
[1:31:37] and most of you are distraught.
[1:31:41] You've been so deflated by people and
[1:31:44] issues and things around you.
[1:31:48] You've lost some of your joy.
[1:31:51] Some of you have lost your clap.
[1:31:54] Instead of clapping,
[1:31:56] your hands are on the back of the seat
[1:31:59] and you just stand there as long as you
[1:32:00] can stand. And then you sat down and
[1:32:02] then you're just trying to sing and
[1:32:04] you're trying to do everything you can
[1:32:06] to to be a good solid Christian.
[1:32:09] But I've got some therapy for you
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; now. Walgreens does not have this
[1:32:16] prescription. Okay? CVS, your favorite
[1:32:20] pharmacy, whoever it is, Walmart. I was
[1:32:22] unable to fax it to them this evening
[1:32:25] because they would have never understood
[1:32:27] what I'm fixing to share with you.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; How many needs it? How many wants it?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Is the bottle got your name on it
[1:32:36] tonight?
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 33:29.
[1:32:42] Happy art thou, oh Israel. Now remember
[1:32:45] many of the promises of the Old
[1:32:46] Testament that were given to Israel are
[1:32:48] also given to the Gentile overcomers in
[1:32:51] the New Testament. Happy art thou, O
[1:32:54] Israel, who is like unto thee, oh people
[1:32:58] saved by the Lord, the shield of thy
[1:33:02] help, who is the sword of thy
[1:33:05] excellency, and thine enemies shall be
[1:33:08] found liars unto thee, and thou shalt
[1:33:12] tread upon their high places.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; There's dose number one. Now, I am
[1:33:19] hoping tonight with all of my heart that
[1:33:22] I can overdose you so much so that some
[1:33:27] of you may walk out of here tonight so
[1:33:29] drunk on the Holy Ghost and so
[1:33:32] intoxicated on the promises of God that
[1:33:36] you go looking for that devil.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may have drugged
[1:33:41] yourself in, but I'm hoping you're going
[1:33:44] to fly high on your way out. Now listen
[1:33:47] to me. We must take the stand on God's
[1:33:51] promises and God's word and let God's
[1:33:54] word minister to us. Does this sermon
[1:33:57] have your name on it tonight?
[1:34:00] Psalm 47 and1 to the chief musician of
[1:34:03] song for the sons of Kora. I want you to
[1:34:06] notice this. Remember who Kora was? You
[1:34:09] remember who Kora was in the Bible? Kora
[1:34:12] who withtood God's prophet. But here
[1:34:15] were some of his sons that were faithful
[1:34:18] to the message even though their daddy
[1:34:21] left the message and stood against God's
[1:34:24] prophet. But they were sons of Kora, but
[1:34:27] more importantly, they were sons of the
[1:34:30] most high God.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may have some reproach
[1:34:35] to bear tonight. You may have some, you
[1:34:37] know, things that would make you kind of
[1:34:39] hang your head, but it's all going to
[1:34:41] depend upon which message you want to
[1:34:43] hear. If you're a son of Kora tonight or
[1:34:46] a daughter of Kora, it doesn't mean that
[1:34:49] has to be your identity because this
[1:34:52] song can have your name on it.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, clap your hands. All ye people,
[1:35:02] shout unto God with the voice of
[1:35:08] triumph.
[1:35:12] Clap your hands, oh ye people. Shout
[1:35:17] unto God with the voice of triumph.
[1:35:26] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Psalm 47:2.
[1:35:30] For the Lord most high is terrible. Ah,
[1:35:35] here we go.
[1:35:37] The Lord most high is terrible, but not
[1:35:41] to you, just to your enemies. The Lord
[1:35:45] most high is terrible. He is a great
[1:35:48] king over all the earth. He shall subdue
[1:35:52] the people under us and the nations
[1:35:55] under our feet. He shall choose our
[1:35:58] inheritance for us. Oh, glory to God. He
[1:36:02] shall choose my inheritance. He chose me
[1:36:05] not to be a foolish virgin, but to be
[1:36:07] bride. He chose me not to go in
[1:36:09] tribulation period. I believe he chose
[1:36:11] me to go in the rapture. It was not my
[1:36:14] choice, your choice, your choice. But
[1:36:16] according to the Bible, the Lord God
[1:36:18] chose my inheritance. He chose for me to
[1:36:20] be happy. He chose for me to be filled
[1:36:23] with the Holy Ghost. He chose for me to
[1:36:25] stand on his word. He chose for me to
[1:36:27] have joy in the midst of troubles and
[1:36:30] trials. And if that's what he chose for
[1:36:32] me, I would be less than a man to not
[1:36:35] receive it and fight for every inch of
[1:36:37] it.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:36:43] He shall choose our inheritance for us,
[1:36:47] the excellency of Jacob whom he loved
[1:36:50] Salah. For God is gone up with a shout.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You mean God shouts?
[1:36:59] Yeah.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God has gone up with a
[1:37:03] shout. The Lord with the sound of a
[1:37:06] trumpet. Sing praises to God. Sing
[1:37:09] praises. Sing praises. Oh my. Unto our
[1:37:12] king. Sing praises. Boy. Oh, David was
[1:37:15] hung up on that on this verse, was he?
[1:37:16] Sing praises. Sing praises. Why not sing
[1:37:20] defeat and sadness and how low you are
[1:37:22] and how much trouble you got? That's
[1:37:24] exactly what Satan wants you to do when
[1:37:26] you're going through the downtime and
[1:37:28] low times and difficult times and you
[1:37:30] don't know what to do. He wants to steal
[1:37:32] your song. He wants to steal your joy.
[1:37:34] He wants to steal your praise. He wants
[1:37:36] to steal your desire to come to the
[1:37:38] house of God because he knows how
[1:37:40] important it is for you to come to
[1:37:42] church.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Psalm 144:15.
[1:37:52] sad, beat down, downtrodden, low,
[1:37:55] pitiful, never have no joy, never have
[1:37:58] no peace
[1:38:00] is the people.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Happy is that people that is in such a
[1:38:06] case. Yay. Happy is that people whose
[1:38:11] God is the Lord.
[1:38:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Psalm 61:2, "From the end of the earth
[1:38:19] will I cry unto thee when my heart is
[1:38:22] overwhelmed." Here's you a little more
[1:38:24] therapy right here. When my heart is
[1:38:26] overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is
[1:38:30] higher than I. Oh men of God, if you see
[1:38:35] me down, don't leave me there. Saints of
[1:38:37] God, if you see me down, don't leave me
[1:38:40] there. Pray for me. Send me a card.
[1:38:42] Write me. Knock on my door. Whatever
[1:38:45] you've got to do, don't leave me down in
[1:38:47] the valley. Don't leave me distraught.
[1:38:49] And neither am I. I'm going to leave
[1:38:51] you. Whatever I've got to do, I'm going
[1:38:53] to come and get you. I'm not going to
[1:38:55] leave you in the valley of despair. I'm
[1:38:58] not going to let Satan steal your joy.
[1:39:00] I'll give my last breath preaching it to
[1:39:02] you.
[1:39:11] For thou has been a shelter for me. Oh,
[1:39:18] somebody
[1:39:19] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[1:39:24] I. Oh, lead me.
[1:39:28] Somebody lead me.
[1:39:31] Hallelujah.
[1:39:33] Thou has been a shelter for me and a
[1:39:35] strong tower from the enemy. I will
[1:39:37] abide in thy tabernacle forever. I will
[1:39:40] trust in the covered of thy wings. Sah
[1:39:43] right.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Galatians 6:9.
[1:39:47] Let us not be weary.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; And welloing. You mean to tell me a
[1:39:53] person can be doing well in the eyes of
[1:39:56] God and be weary? Listen to the meaning
[1:39:58] of this word. Faint. To be utterly
[1:40:02] spiritless.
[1:40:04] to be wearied out,
[1:40:07] exhausted,
[1:40:10] exhausted from the battle,
[1:40:14] just tired
[1:40:16] of fighting.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You ever get tired, Brother Donnie? I
[1:40:24] do.
[1:40:26] I do, just like all the rest of you do.
[1:40:29] But I ain't quitting. No,
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; I said I ain't quitting.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; 2 Thessalonians 3:13. But ye, brethren,
[1:40:39] be not weary and welloing.
[1:40:42] Now, here's let me give you just a
[1:40:44] little mega dose here, then we'll close
[1:40:46] here momentarily. Enticing spirits. I
[1:40:50] said, I don't condemn the drunkard for
[1:40:51] going out and getting drunk. He's all
[1:40:52] moody. He don't know. He gets up in the
[1:40:55] morning, he's got the blues hangover. Oh
[1:40:58] my. goes out and gets him two or three
[1:41:00] bottles of beer. Goes out and gets him
[1:41:03] some whiskey and all that kind of stuff.
[1:41:05] Little old cigarette sucker, sits back
[1:41:08] and smoke and blow it up through his
[1:41:09] nose like that like a freight train.
[1:41:12] I don't blame him. That's all the joy he
[1:41:15] knows. That's all he's he's a pig
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; by nature.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Shame on you who profess to be a
[1:41:23] Christian and rely on such things for
[1:41:25] joy.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Now listen. When the Holy Ghost gospel
[1:41:30] is nothing but one great big powerhouse
[1:41:34] of joy.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost Gospel is a perfect
[1:41:40] intoxication
[1:41:42] for every man. Well, hallelujah. That's
[1:41:44] got the blues. You take a drink of the
[1:41:48] gospel of Jesus Christ and be filled
[1:41:50] with the Holy Ghost, you're drunk until
[1:41:54] you leave this world. Amen. Joy,
[1:41:57] unspeakable, full of glory. It's a
[1:42:00] constant stimulation. It's a constant
[1:42:03] intoxication.
[1:42:04] Drunk day and night.
[1:42:16] I finally figured it out.
[1:42:19] Some of y'all ain't drunk enough.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; You're way too sober.
[1:42:24] You're still thinking, well, I think and
[1:42:26] I believe and this is what I think and
[1:42:27] I, you know, I I' I've been sitting on
[1:42:29] this and I processed it this way and you
[1:42:31] know, I've got to understand this and I
[1:42:32] you're not drunk. And if you get drunk,
[1:42:34] you say, "Glory to God, I believe him."
[1:42:36] Anyhow,
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; but the Lord give and the Lord to come
[1:42:40] to what you say about that. Blessed be
[1:42:42] the name of the Lord. Got another drink.
[1:42:46] Give me a more intoxication of the Holy
[1:42:47] Ghost. Let me just get so drunk I don't
[1:42:49] even know what my name is. Oh,
[1:42:51] hallelujah. Now, come on, friends. Oh,
[1:42:53] brother Donnie, I I now I I believe in
[1:42:55] the word. I do, too. But I also believe
[1:42:57] the word according to the third seal,
[1:42:58] fourth seal question answers, and also
[1:43:00] the seven seal. When the prophet of God
[1:43:02] talks about stimulation by revelation,
[1:43:04] now the only thing I can figure out is
[1:43:06] some of the folks in the message got so
[1:43:08] stimulated by the revelation, they
[1:43:10] passed out
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; and they're sitting there in church
[1:43:12] passed out. They sat there and snore in
[1:43:14] church. But you know what? When brother
[1:43:16] Brandham defined what that was, now
[1:43:17] people say, "Well, now I know what that
[1:43:19] means." I do too because I hear the
[1:43:21] prophet of God when he's preaching that
[1:43:23] and the people in the tabernacle are
[1:43:24] screaming and hollering and shouting. He
[1:43:26] said, "That's what's wrong with them
[1:43:28] right now." So, he identified what that
[1:43:31] stimulation of revelation will do. And
[1:43:33] the church said,
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; "Oh my, but I don't feel like it,
[1:43:39] brother. I don't feel like it."
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 33:11.
[1:43:45] You talking about a miracle? The Lord
[1:43:47] giving me all this in just a matter of
[1:43:48] minutes. You know, I'm a serious
[1:43:50] preacher. So, I'm a slow put her
[1:43:51] together sort of guy. I do a search of
[1:43:54] 300 quotes here and 295 here and 118
[1:43:57] over there looking at three versions of
[1:43:58] the Bible and then looking through the
[1:44:00] message. I've got six six windows open
[1:44:02] at one time, three of the Bible, three
[1:44:04] of the message, going back and forth,
[1:44:05] four study windows and sending it all
[1:44:07] the time. And for the Lord to put
[1:44:08] something together like this for me,
[1:44:10] it's an absolute miracle.
[1:44:13] Praise the Lord of hosts, for the Lord
[1:44:15] is good. For his mercy endureth forever,
[1:44:18] and of them that shall bring sacrifices
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; of praise
[1:44:25] and to the house of the Lord. For I will
[1:44:27] cause to return the captivity of the
[1:44:28] land as at the first saith the Lord.
[1:44:30] Hebrews 13:15, By him, therefore, let us
[1:44:34] offer the sacrifice
[1:44:36] of praise to Godually.
[1:44:42] continually.
[1:44:43] That is the fruit of our lips giving
[1:44:46] thanks to God.
[1:44:48] But you see,
[1:44:50] praise does not always cost us
[1:44:53] something.
[1:44:55] Let me show you what I mean.
[1:44:57] You can actually praise your dog
[1:45:01] or your cat or your horse or if you got
[1:45:04] a guinea pig or whatever you have like
[1:45:06] that and and you're, you know, you want
[1:45:08] to show your your neighbors what your
[1:45:09] dog can do. So you throw a stick and you
[1:45:12] swat out turn. Go get it, Pho. And Pho
[1:45:14] goes
[1:45:16] and he grabs that stick and go. Good
[1:45:18] boy. Good boy. Good boy. And you give
[1:45:21] him a treat. Good boy. Good boy. I
[1:45:24] wonder friends.
[1:45:26] Do you understand? If we're not careful,
[1:45:28] that's the way we do God.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; When God will do what we ask the way we
[1:45:34] ask it,
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; then we will give God a treat
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; of praise.
[1:45:44] And if God don't do it the way we don't,
[1:45:46] then we get angry at God and we will not
[1:45:48] treat God.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; So we won't praise him.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; I ain't done it.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; I ain't done it. I raise my hands. I
[1:45:55] don't care what to say. I ain't done it.
[1:45:58] You mean you're treating God like your
[1:46:00] dog
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; or your horse or your cat or your pet,
[1:46:04] whatever.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; That's not a sacrifice.
[1:46:10] I'm winding down now.
[1:46:13] I'm coming to a close.
[1:46:16] I just ain't got there yet, but I'm
[1:46:18] coming. I'm on my way. Now, y'all bear
[1:46:19] with me.
[1:46:22] So, we reward our dog or an animal or
[1:46:24] whatever more with praise. Now, think of
[1:46:27] you ever thought of it that way that you
[1:46:29] give your dog or your child or whatever
[1:46:31] it is praise. So, you reward them with
[1:46:33] praise. Good boy. Good boy. Oh, my good
[1:46:36] boy. Do you understand purposes? and and
[1:46:39] killer whales. Those of you that have
[1:46:40] been to any of those places, SeaWorld or
[1:46:42] whatever, and how do they train them
[1:46:44] animals to do that? What is it based on
[1:46:47] the understanding all the English and
[1:46:48] all that? Reward.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; What do they do with them kid or whales
[1:46:52] come over and they flip and they do this
[1:46:54] that and other
[1:46:56] rewarding them? No, not like you'd
[1:46:58] reward your kid with a Tootsie Roll or
[1:46:59] Lifesavers or something like that, but
[1:47:01] they got fish. Everything they do, it's
[1:47:05] a reward. Is that the way we treat our
[1:47:08] God?
[1:47:09] That whenever he does something and he
[1:47:12] don't break our heart and he don't, you
[1:47:14] know, just confuse us by the way he
[1:47:16] moves, we reward him. Oh Jesus, thank
[1:47:19] you. Thank you. Thank you. You answered
[1:47:21] my prayer. Lord, you help me pay my
[1:47:23] bill. Lord, thank you. Thank you. Thank
[1:47:26] you. And then whenever he don't,
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; let's everybody praise him. I ain't
[1:47:32] praise him. I asked him for this, that,
[1:47:35] and other, and he didn't do it. I ain't
[1:47:36] doing it. I ain't praising him. I'm mad.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Speak to us, Jesus.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Battle fatigue
[1:47:48] syndrome.
[1:47:52] Anybody bold enough to say, "Preach it,
[1:47:54] Brother Donnie."
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Preach it, Brother.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.
[1:47:59] Now, watch.
[1:48:02] Praise is often our response
[1:48:05] for an action that God does and it
[1:48:08] directly benefits us of course. So we
[1:48:12] find it easy to praise him for blessings
[1:48:14] and peace and answered prayers and
[1:48:16] whenever he's helped us and all that in
[1:48:18] the way that we think he could and we
[1:48:20] can sing and boy we worship and tears
[1:48:22] will flow down our eyes and that's the
[1:48:25] kind of worship although that is you
[1:48:26] know is it really what God wants
[1:48:31] God is not
[1:48:33] a bargaining tool
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; when you're standing and giving God
[1:48:38] praise for something you answer to
[1:48:40] prayer that is no sacrifice at all.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; But there's times
[1:48:52] when the medical test will come back
[1:48:54] positive.
[1:48:56] And you come up for prayer and you were
[1:48:57] just convinced, no, it's going to be
[1:48:59] gone. The growth is not going to be
[1:49:01] there. It's not going to be there.
[1:49:05] And if it hadn't have been there, you
[1:49:06] would have turned the testimony report
[1:49:08] in. Brother Louie would have stood up
[1:49:09] and read it. Glory to God. Brother so
[1:49:11] and so went to the doctor and they said
[1:49:13] this was there, but now they done an
[1:49:14] X-ray. It wasn't there. What would you
[1:49:15] all have done? Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:49:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; But if they come back and say, "Well,
[1:49:22] they done the scan of the doctor said it
[1:49:24] was still there and it's bigger now than
[1:49:26] it was before." Anybody praise God that
[1:49:28] he's still God?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on, preacher.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; He's still God no matter what the test
[1:49:35] say. But what have I got to praise him
[1:49:37] for? That he's still God. And he's still
[1:49:40] a healer. And he's still God over your
[1:49:42] life. He controls your life. He's the
[1:49:44] one that brought you on the earth. He's
[1:49:45] the one that'll take you off.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; The mortgage company tells you you got
[1:49:51] so many days or they're going to
[1:49:52] foreclose on you.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't got another praising for
[1:50:01] mama.
[1:50:03] We can't see his goodness sometimes when
[1:50:06] the circumstances dictate to us he
[1:50:09] didn't give us what we ask
[1:50:13] to praise God in those times requires
[1:50:16] personal sacrifice
[1:50:20] and I hate to say it but many people
[1:50:22] even in the message have not learned it
[1:50:24] yet. The command in Hebrews 13:15 that
[1:50:28] we just read says that sacrifices are to
[1:50:31] be offered to him continually.
[1:50:34] So the praise to our God should not be
[1:50:36] based upon our opinion when the answer
[1:50:40] was good or not so good.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; God wants your praise. And it's actually
[1:50:46] more sacrificial
[1:50:48] when you stand there and say, "God, I
[1:50:50] don't understand, but I love you.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; I worship you. I praise you. My wife is
[1:50:57] not suffering anymore. My husband's not
[1:50:59] suffering anymore. God, thank you that
[1:51:02] they're not lost. Thank you. They're
[1:51:04] there in that sixth dimension and every
[1:51:06] day I'm getting closer to him. But what
[1:51:08] do we focus on? Our personal loss.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; We stop praising him.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; You see, real praise continues
[1:51:17] regardless of the circumstance. It flows
[1:51:20] continually from a worshshiping heart.
[1:51:23] Notice in Acts 16:23, "And when they had
[1:51:26] laid many stripes upon them, Paul and
[1:51:28] Silas, two preachers, when they had laid
[1:51:31] many stripes upon them, and cast them
[1:51:34] into prison, charging the jailer to keep
[1:51:36] them safely, who having received such a
[1:51:39] charge, thrust them into the inner
[1:51:41] prison, and made their feet fast in the
[1:51:43] stocks." And at midnight, Paul got mad
[1:51:46] and said, "I'll tell you one thing. I'm
[1:51:47] turning in my preachers's license, and I
[1:51:50] wish I had never left the Pharisees.
[1:51:53] Ever since I've been serving this Jesus,
[1:51:55] I ain't nothing but I had a hard way to
[1:51:56] go.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; At midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and
[1:52:02] sang praises unto God.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Setting up blood running down their
[1:52:06] backs, strips of meat hanging down their
[1:52:08] back. And what did they do, Carol? They
[1:52:10] learned how to praise him in the midst
[1:52:12] of all that. Can you imagine setting up
[1:52:14] stripes down your back? Now, what would
[1:52:15] you said? That was the church age
[1:52:17] messenger of that first age. I wonder
[1:52:19] what the people at that age would have
[1:52:20] said if they'd had a newspaper and had
[1:52:22] come out the next morning. Prophet of
[1:52:23] God thrown in jail. Prophet of God
[1:52:26] beaten like a criminal. I wonder if
[1:52:28] they'd printed the afternoon version
[1:52:30] though. Prophet of God sang and shouted
[1:52:32] and shut the jail house down.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Notice they did not let their conditions
[1:52:40] dictate their praise.
[1:52:43] You imagine how it hurt their backs
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; and their arms
[1:52:49] to raise their hands.
[1:53:01] Oh Jesus,
[1:53:03] thank you. Thank you for your light.
[1:53:05] Thank you for your mercy.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Oh children,
[1:53:10] take your medicine.
[1:53:12] take your last praise pill.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed
[1:53:20] and sang praises unto God.
[1:53:24] And they wouldn't meeting at the Brandom
[1:53:26] Tabernacle on Wednesday night and having
[1:53:29] silent prayer.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; but the prisoners heard him. God has
[1:53:37] always demanded public worship of his
[1:53:40] people.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; One of the first signs of people
[1:53:44] backsliding when they think they no
[1:53:46] longer need to go to church.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I don't care who they are, what
[1:53:50] their name is, or where they live. One
[1:53:52] of the first signs of people
[1:53:53] backsliding, getting cold on God, they
[1:53:56] think they can keep their worship and
[1:53:57] their religion in their home. You
[1:53:59] yellowbellied cowards. You Well, come
[1:54:02] on, somebody. Oh my. As long as there's
[1:54:05] a bride on the earth, there's going to
[1:54:07] be a bride that's going to come out and
[1:54:09] assemble themselves together. Come on,
[1:54:11] somebody say amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; And suddenly there was a great
[1:54:16] earthquake so that the foundations of
[1:54:18] the prison were shaken and immediately
[1:54:20] all the doors were open and everyone's
[1:54:24] bands were loose. Paul and Silas done
[1:54:26] the praising and all the rest of them
[1:54:28] received the benefit.
[1:54:33] You know what? There might be somebody
[1:54:34] beside you that ain't got enough joy to
[1:54:37] do it. But it might start with you, my
[1:54:39] brother. It may start with you, my
[1:54:41] sister. And then when you go to praising
[1:54:43] God, their bands go to shaken off, too.
[1:54:45] And they say, "Praise the Lord. Praise
[1:54:48] the Lord." Why? Because you offered a
[1:54:50] sacrifice of praise. And it made God so
[1:54:54] happy up there in heaven that he started
[1:54:56] kind of patting his foot and it caused
[1:54:58] an earthquake down on the earth and
[1:55:00] shook that old jail down. And here goes
[1:55:03] Paul and Silas saying glory to God.
[1:55:05] Hallelujah.
[1:55:07] [Applause]
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You see, look what this is. And I'm
[1:55:14] closing. The sacrifice of praise
[1:55:19] comes from a humble heart
[1:55:23] that has been sanctified
[1:55:26] by fire.
[1:55:30] The fire is so cleansed that heart of
[1:55:33] selfishness. It no longer processes
[1:55:36] praise through their own human
[1:55:39] understanding. Or well, I'm going to
[1:55:40] praise him like my dog. I'm going to
[1:55:42] praise him like my horse. I'm going to
[1:55:44] No, the fire of God has cleansed it out.
[1:55:47] And they say, "I'm going to praise him.
[1:55:49] I got another day to live. I got another
[1:55:51] day to worship God. I'm one day closer
[1:55:53] to heaven. I'm one day closer to home."
[1:55:55] Friends, you've got so much more to be
[1:55:56] happy for than what we're giving him
[1:55:58] recognition for.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; It rises from a spirit that has chosen
[1:56:06] to honor God in spite of the pain and
[1:56:11] the sorrow.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. Let me read this
[1:56:15] last verse with you.
[1:56:17] Psalms 51:17,
[1:56:21] "The sacrifices of God
[1:56:26] are a broken spirit,
[1:56:30] a broken
[1:56:32] and contrite heart.
[1:56:35] Oh God,
[1:56:37] thou wilt not despise."
[1:56:42] So, we think God only wants our praise
[1:56:44] when we're well and everything is going
[1:56:46] good. No. David says the sacrifices of
[1:56:50] God
[1:56:52] are a broken spirit.
[1:56:55] Oh, what it must make him feel like when
[1:56:57] his children are broken. I've been
[1:57:00] broken. You've been broken.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; You've been broken, brother Chip. You
[1:57:05] saints, you've been broken.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; I've been broken many times. in many
[1:57:10] ways. But I don't mind telling you, you
[1:57:12] know it well. I hope you don't get tired
[1:57:14] of hearing it. But when the Lord in his
[1:57:16] wisdom
[1:57:18] declared and manifested his will with
[1:57:20] taking Erica from the earth,
[1:57:23] I went through an aspect of things in my
[1:57:25] life that I never went through before.
[1:57:30] I sat right back in that office in that
[1:57:31] chair and the first service I had to
[1:57:33] come out after we buried my daughter's
[1:57:35] body. I sat back there in that chair and
[1:57:38] shook like a leaf.
[1:57:40] Sick to my stomach. Broke out in a cold
[1:57:43] sweat. And I told God, "God, I cannot
[1:57:46] walk out that door and face them people.
[1:57:49] I can't do it.
[1:57:52] I just can't I can't do it
[1:57:55] cuz I don't have all the answers."
[1:57:58] But you know what the good thing was? He
[1:58:00] didn't expect me to.
[1:58:02] But you know what I done? Finally, by
[1:58:05] the grace of God, I got myself together
[1:58:06] and I walked out that door and I
[1:58:08] preached like I've been preaching for
[1:58:09] all along.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; And you know what I've been hearing from
[1:58:12] people around this world?
[1:58:15] Brother Donnie the stand, you and Sister
[1:58:17] Carol and Lance and the girls and Lisa
[1:58:20] and their daughters and their husband
[1:58:22] and the church. It has reverberated
[1:58:25] around the world.
[1:58:27] People have been so strengthened and so
[1:58:29] encouraged
[1:58:31] by your stand.
[1:58:33] I say thank you Lord.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; I preached many funerals, cried at many,
[1:58:42] many funerals. I didn't ever one I
[1:58:45] preach.
[1:58:46] How many now, Sister Barbara, has it
[1:58:48] been?
[1:58:52] 158
[1:58:56] since I've been here.
[1:59:01] But none of them ever affected me like
[1:59:03] my own.
[1:59:05] My daddy died, my mama died, one of my
[1:59:08] favorite aunts died, mary's sister died.
[1:59:12] But when Erica passed,
[1:59:16] did you know why I didn't? And I still
[1:59:19] don't.
[1:59:21] But I still believe him.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; And I still trust him.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm praising him, brother Jonathan,
[1:59:29] like never before. And it's been more of
[1:59:32] a sacrifice for me than it's ever been
[1:59:34] in my entire life.
[1:59:38] When I was dealing with that planter
[1:59:39] fasciitis and my feet, I couldn't hardly
[1:59:41] walk. I laid the stone on that column
[1:59:43] right there. And when I got home in the
[1:59:46] evenings after laying the stone, I'd
[1:59:49] have to call Carol on the phone and say,
[1:59:51] "Come help me out of the truck. I can't
[1:59:54] walk."
[1:59:56] I went through that about two years,
[1:59:58] something like that. I never stopped and
[2:00:00] never slowed down. Kept right on going.
[2:00:02] I'm still praising him for healing me of
[2:00:04] that.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; But you know what? I didn't start
[2:00:07] praising him after my feet got better,
[2:00:08] Sister Carol. I started praising before
[2:00:10] they ever got better.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; But I have to say, I've learned to
[2:00:14] praise him like never before.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; And I want to be your example if I can.
[2:00:22] I want to be an influence if I can.
[2:00:28] Do you want to be an example to someone
[2:00:30] too?
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; See, God may use men to be an example of
[2:00:33] different people around the world that
[2:00:34] you'd never influence. Well, what can I
[2:00:37] do? What can I do? What about that one
[2:00:38] person standing by you that's a close
[2:00:40] friend? Maybe your husband, your wife,
[2:00:42] somebody standing in the back of the
[2:00:43] church. Let your light shine, my
[2:00:46] brother, sister.
[2:00:48] Don't you love him?
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; I was over here this morning doing some
[2:00:52] work and I saw some guys over here in a
[2:00:53] white pickup. I thought, I wonder what
[2:00:55] them guys are doing. So I seen them out
[2:00:56] there. I couldn't really understand what
[2:00:57] they was doing. So I planted some some
[2:00:59] plants out here and I come around back
[2:01:01] to unload the garbage in the dumpster.
[2:01:03] And I saw one sanitary the back door and
[2:01:05] said, "Hey, buddy. What y'all doing?" He
[2:01:06] said, "Oh, we're here to check the uh
[2:01:09] sprinkler system." Said, "We have to
[2:01:11] check it every now and then." I said,
[2:01:12] "Oh, okay." So here I stand in blue
[2:01:15] jeans, mud all over me, sweatshirt,
[2:01:18] t-shirt hanging out, soaking wet with
[2:01:21] sweat, sweat running down my face,
[2:01:22] probably no doubt dirt all over me. He
[2:01:25] said, ' Who are you?' I said, 'I'm the
[2:01:26] preacher.'
[2:01:29] He just kind of looked at me up and down
[2:01:30] like that. You know, I thought, "Oh,
[2:01:31] boy."
[2:01:33] He said, "I'll tell you one thing. If
[2:01:35] this church wasn't so far from where I
[2:01:37] lived, I'd come to church here."
[2:01:42] I said, "Buddy, you're welcome. I got my
[2:01:43] truck and I thought, God,
[2:01:47] that man could be the last one that's
[2:01:49] holding up the bride."
[2:01:52] the person that you meet and they say,
[2:01:53] "Where do you go to church at? What what
[2:01:55] do you do?" You understand, friends,
[2:01:57] there may not be but one more.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; There may not be but 10 or 12. And the
[2:02:01] whole rapture being held, let your light
[2:02:04] so shine before men that they may see
[2:02:07] your good works and glorify your father
[2:02:10] which is in heaven.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; I got an email from a brother lives
[2:02:15] many, many thousands and thousands and
[2:02:17] thousands of miles away from us here. He
[2:02:19] said, "Brother Donnie, we heard your
[2:02:20] testimony about Sister Erica." And he
[2:02:22] said, "We cried when she passed." He
[2:02:24] said, "But we're believing God. It won't
[2:02:25] be long we'll be together." He said,
[2:02:27] "But I want to let you know your stand
[2:02:28] for the gospel has so influenced us." He
[2:02:30] said, "My family member had a hand took
[2:02:32] off because of cancer. Had a leg took
[2:02:34] off because of cancer. Had a breast took
[2:02:36] off because of cancer. But we're
[2:02:37] believing God for a complete
[2:02:39] restoration.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; And your stand for the gospel has been
[2:02:42] an influence in our life." I said,
[2:02:43] "Praise be to God.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; We never know.
[2:02:49] But when you don't feel like it, when
[2:02:50] your hands is tired and you don't feel
[2:02:52] like it on Wednesday night, can you put
[2:02:54] them up and say, "Oh Jesus, I love you
[2:02:57] so much. I give you this sacrifice,
[2:03:00] Lord, but at least your back hasn't been
[2:03:02] beat today, has it?"
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Like Paul and Silas was.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him, saints?
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads if you would.
[2:03:13] Oh Jesus,
[2:03:17] we always marvel at your ways. Lord,
[2:03:22] I thank you, dear God, for this little
[2:03:25] moment of inspiration today as I look
[2:03:28] back and see
[2:03:31] how it was all just orchestrated.
[2:03:34] The people sitting around Carol and I at
[2:03:37] Olive Garden didn't have a clue.
[2:03:40] My wife, bless her heart, she didn't
[2:03:42] either cuz she just sat there and I'm
[2:03:45] sure she noticed I got quiet and I
[2:03:47] started sending myself emails. She's
[2:03:50] used to that because we'll be driving
[2:03:51] down the road and I'll see a sign or
[2:03:53] something and I'll tell her send me
[2:03:55] these words text or whatever it is
[2:03:57] email. So, she's used to use dealing
[2:04:00] with me in odd and strange locations I
[2:04:04] guess.
[2:04:05] But I thought how how awesome you are.
[2:04:10] I wasn't down on my face praying
[2:04:13] but sitting there in Olive Garden
[2:04:14] waiting for her our lunch
[2:04:18] and in just a few moments your
[2:04:20] inspiration come.
[2:04:23] Why? Because you love us so much.
[2:04:27] You want to speak things to us that help
[2:04:29] us Lord.
[2:04:31] Oh Jesus. You know how many of children
[2:04:34] tonight present and those that'll stream
[2:04:36] this service, those that'll go back and
[2:04:38] archive it. Maybe they're sick, their
[2:04:41] symptoms are bad, they can see from the
[2:04:43] diagnosis tonight. But may they not just
[2:04:46] focus on the diagnosis,
[2:04:50] but the treatment,
[2:04:52] the treatment.
[2:04:54] Lord God, your word. Forgive us, Lord,
[2:04:58] if I've ever treated you like a dog.
[2:05:02] If I've ever treated you like a pet
[2:05:05] whenever you would do something in the
[2:05:06] way that I acted that I gave you a
[2:05:09] treat.
[2:05:12] Forgive me, God.
[2:05:14] Forgive my people if we've ever done
[2:05:17] that to you. Lord,
[2:05:19] may this transform
[2:05:22] our lives. I pray. Father,
[2:05:25] may we gain a complete new perspective
[2:05:27] and value on sacrifices
[2:05:31] of praise.
[2:05:33] We worship you tonight, Lord God.
[2:05:37] Thank you, heavenly father.
[2:05:41] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:44] With every head bowed, I just wonder
[2:05:46] tonight
[2:05:48] how many of you can say to the Lord,
[2:05:50] "Lord,
[2:05:52] I myself have experienced this battle
[2:05:56] fatigue
[2:05:57] syndrome.
[2:05:59] I've been on the battlefield
[2:06:02] against sin and even some of my family,
[2:06:04] Lord, and even sometimes church people,
[2:06:07] people we go to church with."
[2:06:11] And Lord, uh, my my emotions is affected
[2:06:13] and psychologically I'm affected and but
[2:06:17] Lord, you let me make a trip tonight.
[2:06:21] Except I didn't have to get all ready to
[2:06:23] go to the doctor's office, but the
[2:06:26] doctor came to where I lived.
[2:06:28] Jesus, you still do house visits
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; and you certainly specialize in church
[2:06:35] visits.
[2:06:38] So, thank you tonight, our doctor, for
[2:06:40] making a church visit
[2:06:43] for your children.
[2:06:45] We're needed tonight, Lord. And we'll
[2:06:48] take your diagnosis
[2:06:50] cuz we know you've never lost a case.
[2:06:53] And you're not practicing medicine.
[2:06:56] You're doing it. Cuz you don't have to
[2:06:58] practice like doctors and nurses and PAs
[2:07:02] and all that do. They try this and they
[2:07:03] try that. They're doing their best. No
[2:07:05] doubt many of them are. because there
[2:07:06] can be several things that'll have very
[2:07:08] similar symptoms. But you don't have to
[2:07:10] give us this and then if that don't
[2:07:11] work, we'll take another antibiotic in
[2:07:13] 14 days and if that don't work, we'll
[2:07:15] try another one. You know exactly what
[2:07:17] we have need of at the very first visit.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; So I believe tonight, Lord, we've come
[2:07:23] into your presence
[2:07:25] and you made a visit to us.
[2:07:28] Hallelujah. We got ready and come to
[2:07:30] church tonight. These people didn't even
[2:07:33] know. The only ones even knew this title
[2:07:34] was the brothers that got the notes. And
[2:07:36] they probably looked at it and thought,
[2:07:37] "Oh, wow. What's he going to do
[2:07:38] tonight?" Even Carol didn't know the
[2:07:41] title. I didn't even tell her.
[2:07:43] But you knew tonight, Lord. I thank you
[2:07:46] for it, Jesus.
[2:07:49] Hallelujah. We can leave this place
[2:07:51] tonight
[2:07:52] with great joy and happiness knowing
[2:07:55] that the doctor has diagnosed our case
[2:07:58] and he's done pronounced it. Your time
[2:08:00] under the juniper tree is going to
[2:08:03] restore you.
[2:08:05] And we know that Elijah was able to come
[2:08:07] out from underneath that meal and he
[2:08:09] went on the strength of that for days on
[2:08:11] in supernaturally.
[2:08:14] That food kept him beyond way beyond
[2:08:17] what it should have because you loved
[2:08:20] him and you cared for him. Father,
[2:08:24] how many tonight would raise your hand
[2:08:26] to the Lord? Lord, I need your help.
[2:08:29] I've been going through a spiritual
[2:08:30] battle. Been going through a physical
[2:08:31] battle. Lord, I've come through a
[2:08:32] surgery. I'm wiped out. I've got this.
[2:08:34] I've got that, the other. Lord God,
[2:08:36] remove this fatigue from me, Lord. This
[2:08:40] battle fatigue syndrome. Get my em my
[2:08:42] emotions straightened out, my values
[2:08:44] straightened out, Lord.
[2:08:47] Hallelujah.
[2:08:49] Would you lay your hand on one another?
[2:08:53] Praise be to God.
[2:08:57] Heavenly Father,
[2:08:59] brothers to sisters, brothers to
[2:09:00] brothers, husbands to wives, parents to
[2:09:03] children, whatever it is.
[2:09:06] Maybe one battle scarred veteran lays
[2:09:10] hands on another one.
[2:09:12] You see our needs tonight, Father.
[2:09:16] Oh Jesus,
[2:09:19] may you help us, Lord.
[2:09:24] Lord God, we need you.
[2:09:27] We need your strength, Lord.
[2:09:33] Hallelujah.
[2:09:38] Lay your hand on me.
[2:09:42] Dear God, as we have our hands one on
[2:09:45] the other,
[2:09:47] we bring our fellow soldiers, oh God,
[2:09:49] into your presence.
[2:09:52] Lord, you see where they are. Maybe
[2:09:54] they've left Carmel and they're on the
[2:09:56] way to the juniper tree or they're there
[2:09:58] and they've had a nervous collapse.
[2:10:01] Dear God, I pray for them tonight in the
[2:10:03] name of Jesus.
[2:10:05] No doubt. Dear God, sons, daughters,
[2:10:08] those that's been saved for years and
[2:10:09] years, they find themselves in that
[2:10:12] place tonight, dear God, and you have
[2:10:13] discerned their very hearts. Father, we
[2:10:16] believe when you do that, you have
[2:10:18] medication in your pouch as it were. It
[2:10:21] won't be a hit and miss, dear God, but
[2:10:23] it'll be an absolute hit. Father, in the
[2:10:26] name of Jesus, would you minister to
[2:10:28] your people tonight, Lord? I know many
[2:10:31] of them have had great disappointments
[2:10:32] and it's put them through great valleys
[2:10:34] and trials. Lord Jesus, I pray you'd
[2:10:37] restore their joy tonight. Father,
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus, may they regain
[2:10:43] the value of that sacrificial praise
[2:10:46] that they still have got so much to
[2:10:48] thank you for. Father, in the name of
[2:10:51] Jesus, I pray not only for the visible
[2:10:53] audience, for all those that'll stream
[2:10:54] the service, those that'll archive it.
[2:10:57] In the name of Jesus, may the burdens
[2:10:59] leave them now. Father, Satan, in the
[2:11:02] name of Jesus Christ, take your hands
[2:11:04] off of God's people. You've robbed us of
[2:11:07] our joy. You've robbed us of many of the
[2:11:09] things. It is the king who determines
[2:11:12] our inheritance, not you. Father, move
[2:11:15] for your children tonight. I pray, Lord,
[2:11:18] in the name of Jesus.
[2:11:21] We worship you, Lord. Strengthen her.
[2:11:23] Help him tonight, Father. He's such a
[2:11:25] blessing to your people. God, I pray you
[2:11:28] would help him tonight, Father. Lord,
[2:11:31] we've not talked about it that much and
[2:11:33] we've not went through it that much, but
[2:11:35] I know him well enough to know. I know
[2:11:38] how much you loved Eric. And I know,
[2:11:39] Lord, when she was taken, I know it was
[2:11:42] a hard thing for him. Strengthen him,
[2:11:44] Lord.
[2:11:46] Strengthen him, Father.
[2:11:49] Lord, others here in the church have
[2:11:51] lost their husbands or children or
[2:11:53] wives. They're still dealing with that
[2:11:55] lost father in the name of Jesus. Would
[2:11:59] you bring strength? Would you bring
[2:12:01] healing, Lord? Help them to realize
[2:12:03] they've still got so much to be thankful
[2:12:06] for, Lord. If they lost that husband and
[2:12:09] he was lost, or lost that wife and they
[2:12:11] were lost, or that child, oh, what a
[2:12:14] terrible thing that would be. But Lord,
[2:12:15] to know they're waiting for us just
[2:12:17] beyond the river. We've got so much to
[2:12:20] thank you for tonight, Lord.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Jesus.
[2:12:26] We worship you, Jesus.
[2:12:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:32] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[2:12:35] Praise your holy name.
[2:12:38] Praise the Lord. And the church said,
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Now, each of your prescription dosage
[2:12:46] tonight,
[2:12:48] I will give it to you by dosage
[2:12:50] according to your particular need. Some
[2:12:55] of you might need it five times a day.
[2:12:58] Some of you might need a 50.
[2:13:01] So, it's not a one-sizefits-all.
[2:13:04] So, if you're pretty low, you may might
[2:13:06] need to start praising God going home
[2:13:08] tonight.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; That that be the last thing on your
[2:13:11] lips. Let it be the first thing on your
[2:13:13] lips in the morning.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; If you're not so bad under the juniper
[2:13:17] triion or you're half under and half
[2:13:19] out, you know, three or four doses per
[2:13:21] day might bring you back to normal
[2:13:23] activity. Some of you it might take a
[2:13:26] few services, but we do expect great
[2:13:29] results by at least next Wednesday
[2:13:32] night.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't work, be sure and
[2:13:36] email me and I'll preach this again word
[2:13:38] by word
[2:13:41] cuz it is God's promise and it will
[2:13:43] work.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him, children?
[2:13:54] Oh, how good he is to us.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Sing something for us, sir.
[2:13:59] Don't it make you just want to love him
[2:14:01] so much? Don't it make you feel so sad
[2:14:03] in your heart if you think you've
[2:14:05] treated him like a pet or a dog? You
[2:14:09] reward him? If God would have healed
[2:14:11] your husband, your wife, and you'd still
[2:14:13] be praising him for it, but God didn't
[2:14:15] decide to take him, and you stop
[2:14:17] praising him.
[2:14:19] So, you haven't rewarded God since
[2:14:23] my But that's one thing we love about
[2:14:26] him.
[2:14:27] All the millions of excuses that we give
[2:14:30] him. And he says, "But I still love
[2:14:32] you."
[2:14:34] Let's worship a little before we go, can
[2:14:36] we?
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; In prisoners chain.

[2:20:19] sorry. I'm sorry for what I've done.
[2:20:21] Lord Jesus, come into my life. Help her
[2:20:24] right now. I pray. Lord, we believe that
[2:20:27] this can be the very start of a
[2:20:29] beautiful walk with God. Lord, we don't
[2:20:32] know. This could be the last one. This
[2:20:34] could be the very last one. And Lord,
[2:20:36] when this one has come in and received
[2:20:38] what they need to be, the bride can come
[2:20:41] home. We don't know when it will be, but
[2:20:42] one day it will. Lord God, save her
[2:20:45] right now. Father, I pray in the name of
[2:20:48] Jesus. Save her, Lord. Forgive her of
[2:20:50] her past. Smite them things off of her

[2:30:03] worshippers. We are public worshippers.
[2:30:06] We assemble ourselves together.
[2:30:09] Hallelujah. And especially as we see the
[2:30:11] day approaching and that not as the
[2:30:13] manner of unbelievers is is the way your
[2:30:16] prophet quoted it. And that's the way we
[2:30:17] quoted around here. We're not
[2:30:19] unbelievers. We believe.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord. We bless your
[2:30:24] name. We want our God. Hallelujah. We
[2:30:27] want our God to shine out of us. We're
[2:30:29] not going to reward you like a like a
[2:30:32] pet or a dog or a cat. We're going to
[2:30:34] praise you when we feel like it. We're
[2:30:36] going to praise you when we're sick.
[2:30:37] We're going to praise you when we're up.
[2:30:39] We're going to praise you when we're
[2:30:40] down. We're going to praise you, Lord.
[2:30:43] That's who we are. Oh, hallelujah. Can
[2:30:46] you sing that praise him through the
[2:30:47] storm? You know that. I know you know
[2:30:49] what you're singing for. It's been a
[2:30:51] while. Can we sing one more before we
[2:30:53] go?
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Bar more ministry time before we go. Cut
[2:30:56] your time short. Start talking to
[2:30:58] brother Tom and talking to everybody
[2:30:59] else. Let's just talk here to Jesus
[2:31:00] while we're here before we go. Praise
[2:31:02] the Lord. Oh friends, it's a privilege
[2:31:04] for us to be gathered in the house of
[2:31:06] God.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:31:12] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:31:15] I was sure by now
[2:31:18] that you would have reached down
[2:31:22] and wiped our tears away.
[2:31:27] Stepped in save the day.
[2:31:31] But once again,
[2:31:34] hallelujah, say amen.
[2:31:37] [Music]
[2:31:39] And it's still raining.
[2:31:42] [Music]
[2:31:43] And as the thunder rolls,
[2:31:47] I barely hear you whisper through the
[2:31:51] rain.
[2:31:54] I'm with you.
[2:31:59] And as your mercy falls,
[2:32:03] I raise my hands and praise the God who
[2:32:07] gives
[2:32:09] and takes away.
[2:32:16] I'll praise you in this storm.
[2:32:20] I will lift my hands.
[2:32:24] You are who you are.
[2:32:27] No matter where I am,
[2:32:31] every tear I cry,
[2:32:35] you hold in your hand.
[2:32:39] You never left my side.
[2:32:43] Though my heart is torn.
[2:32:48] Oh,
[2:32:50] I will praise you in the storm.
[2:32:55] Oh,
[2:33:02] I remember when
[2:33:05] I stumbled in the wind.
[2:33:09] You heard my cry to you. You raised me
[2:33:14] up again.
[2:33:16] My strength is almost gone.
[2:33:20] How can I carry on
[2:33:23] if I can't find you?
[2:33:29] As the thunder rolls,
[2:33:33] I barely hear you whisper through the
[2:33:36] rain.
[2:33:39] I'm with you.
[2:33:44] And as your mercy falls,
[2:33:47] raise my hands. Praise the God who gives
[2:33:52] [Music]
[2:33:53] and takes away.
[2:34:00] I'll praise you in this stor.
[2:34:04] I will lift my hands.
[2:34:07] You are who you are.
[2:34:11] No matter where I am,
[2:34:15] every tear I cry.
[2:34:18] Oh, you hold in your hand.
[2:34:22] You never left my side.
[2:34:26] Though my heart is told,
[2:34:32] I will praise you in this storm.
[2:34:40] Though my heart is torn,
[2:34:47] I will praise you in this storm.
[2:34:55] Though my heart is torn,
[2:34:58] [Music]
[2:35:02] I will praise you in this storm.
[2:35:11] Hallelujah.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:13] [Music]
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:16] [Music]
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; I remember.
[2:35:21] [Music]
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; When
[2:35:27] Jessica was hurt so bad,
[2:35:31] she had all these
[2:35:33] tubes coming out of her body everywhere.
[2:35:36] And
[2:35:39] they
[2:35:40] took her out of that little bed she was
[2:35:42] in.
[2:35:44] They moved the tubes and stuff around
[2:35:46] and
[2:35:49] put her in my arms so I could hold her.
[2:35:52] Just a little old thing.
[2:35:55] All those tubes.
[2:35:58] I begin to sing this song.
[2:36:01] In moments like these, I sing out a
[2:36:05] song.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; I sing out a love song to Jesus.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; And when the Lord came
[2:36:14] and all the tubes was took out, she came
[2:36:18] out of a wheelchair
[2:36:20] and her eyes came open and we came home
[2:36:25] and all the people that were there that
[2:36:27] day. And when everybody left,
[2:36:31] me and Cheryl and Jessica sat down on
[2:36:33] the couch and I took her up in my arms
[2:36:37] and I sung this song in moments like
[2:36:40] these
[2:36:43] because the situation doesn't change who
[2:36:45] he is.
[2:36:47] He's God in the valley. He's God on the
[2:36:49] mountain. And we may have great problems
[2:36:51] and great sickness. And I'm not
[2:36:52] belittling any of that. But I'm here to
[2:36:54] tell you, we have a great God tonight.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; And I've looked all over and I found
[2:36:59] none greater.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that tonight,
[2:37:02] friends?
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It don't mean it don't hurt. Sure,
[2:37:06] it hurts. It hurts. It still hurts. It's
[2:37:08] been years. It still hurts. But we'll
[2:37:10] praise him in the storm. And we serve a
[2:37:12] God who cannot fail. Amen. And we will
[2:37:16] be victorious. Do you love him tonight?
[2:37:17] Have you enjoyed the word of God
[2:37:19] tonight? And hasn't it spoke to your
[2:37:21] heart? Thank you, brother Donnie, so
[2:37:23] much.
[2:37:25] Amen. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. We
[2:37:28] have a word of prayer and then close
[2:37:30] with that. I looked all over. Couldn't
[2:37:33] find nothing. Amen. Let's just bow our
[2:37:36] heads. Amen. Just take someone up on
[2:37:39] your heart now as we pray and just
[2:37:41] remember them.
[2:37:45] Heavenly Father,
[2:37:50] Lord, what a what a wonderful word that
[2:37:53] we've heard tonight.
[2:37:57] And Lord, not only
[2:38:00] did you tell us, Lord, the symptoms,
[2:38:04] but you gave us the cure.
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that, Lord.
[2:38:10] And Father, I pray tonight for my
[2:38:12] brothers and my sisters, Lord, and for
[2:38:14] the families,
[2:38:17] Sister Newsome, Lord, and the children,
[2:38:19] dear God, and their families, Lord, that
[2:38:20] you just comfort their hearts.
[2:38:26] Others, Lord, who are suffering, God,
[2:38:30] different afflictions, I ask you, Lord
[2:38:32] Jesus,
[2:38:35] may you just pass by their way. word,
[2:38:38] take that affliction from them.
[2:38:43] But Lord, until we see an evidence,
[2:38:46] we're going to praise you. We're going
[2:38:48] to thank you for it, Lord, because
[2:38:50] you're our healer. You're our sustainer,
[2:38:52] our comfort, our joy, our strength, our
[2:38:54] peace, our physician, our friend, our
[2:38:57] bridegroom. You're our all and our all.
[2:38:58] Lord,
[2:39:00] go with your children now. Father, we
[2:39:02] pray and
[2:39:04] bring them back safely once again this
[2:39:06] weekend. Lord, watch over my family.
[2:39:08] Keep them safe at home as we travel this
[2:39:10] weekend. Lord, bless the services there
[2:39:13] and here we pray and the little bride
[2:39:14] around the world. We're so glad, Lord,
[2:39:17] that there's no one greater than you.
[2:39:20] And what a privilege it is to bow our
[2:39:23] heads. Prayer is not a burden. It's a
[2:39:25] privilege that we could bow our heads
[2:39:28] and talk to the God who created the
[2:39:31] heavens and earth and you have answered
[2:39:34] back. Thank you Lord. Go with your pe
[2:39:38] your people now. We pray. We ask these
[2:39:40] things in Jesus name. Amen. And amen.
[2:39:45] Amen. Let's just sing us as we go
[2:39:47] tonight. I love this song.

[2:39:55] looked all around, couldn't find nobody.
