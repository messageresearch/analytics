[53:25] praise the Lord
[53:28] Heavenly Father
[53:31] we are so blessed tonight
[53:34] if we truly feel that way from our
[53:36] hearts
[53:38] to us you're not our co-pilot
[53:42] you're not our assistant in life
[53:46] you're not our helper
[53:49] just when things are going bad
[53:52] you're our King
[53:54] our omnipotent ruler
[53:56] our Lord our master
[53:59] a shady eye Jehovah Jara
[54:05] there are all these great things to us
[54:09] Lord Jesus we so thank you Father
[54:13] it's wonderful knowing you that way in
[54:16] life
[54:17] but oh Lord after a while
[54:20] we are going to be even happier if we
[54:23] can imagine him
[54:24] when this world is a rocket and shaken
[54:28] and the stars have fallen from heaven
[54:32] the vultures will be called
[54:34] to eat people's flesh
[54:37] we will be so glad we've been hid in the
[54:40] Rock of Ages
[54:42] so let us be reproached let people laugh
[54:45] at us make fun of us whatever more
[54:48] hide us O Lord God in your great covet
[54:52] of your wings
[54:54] speak to us tonight father would you
[54:57] counted an honor to be gathered together
[54:59] again and sense your presence help us
[55:02] tonight father as we Endeavor to look
[55:05] into your word
[55:06] granted I pray in the name of the Lord
[55:09] Jesus
[55:10] amen
[55:12] God bless you it ain't wonderful to be
[55:13] in the house of the Lord
[55:16] turn with them if you would to
[55:18] Revelation chapter
[55:21] 19 verse 11.
[55:23] now let me just give you a little heads
[55:25] up where we are
[55:27] for those that are living in the end
[55:30] time
[55:31] you're either going to be at supper
[55:34] or you're going
[55:36] to be supper
[55:42] quite simple you're either going to be
[55:45] at supper
[55:48] or you're going to be supper
[55:51] now without hearing my sermon I think
[55:53] anybody in the right mind wants to know
[55:55] which side you want to be on right
[55:57] you don't want to be supper
[56:01] I think they ought to sing some more of
[56:03] them songs it was beautiful let me sing
[56:05] it
[56:06] and we we realize as far as the majority
[56:10] of the world's concerned Jesus has
[56:12] really nothing to do with Christmas
[56:13] anyway
[56:14] but I trust we're not like that
[56:16] but we know that he couldn't have raised
[56:19] from the dead if he hadn't been first
[56:21] born
[56:22] you couldn't raise from the dead if he
[56:24] hadn't died we know that and we're
[56:26] certainly grateful that he came to the
[56:28] Earth but with that being said we're so
[56:30] grateful that he's coming back
[56:34] Revelation chapter
[56:36] 19 verse 11. Lord William Brother David
[56:39] salner be with us this Sunday speaking
[56:41] for us so we come expecting the Lord to
[56:44] speak to our hearts we love and
[56:45] appreciate mother David
[56:47] and I saw heaven opened
[56:50] and behold a white horse
[56:52] and he that set upon him
[56:55] was called faithful and true
[56:59] and in righteousness
[57:02] he doth judge
[57:04] and make war
[57:07] is a terrible thing most of the time
[57:10] and that's because most wars are made
[57:12] for selfish motives selfish objectives
[57:16] and it's not for Godly principles
[57:18] but the Lord Jesus never makes a war
[57:21] with such principles now please listen
[57:23] to me don't misunderstand me sometimes
[57:25] Servants of God have to declare war
[57:29] they do they have to declare war on the
[57:32] worldliness they have to declare war on
[57:33] false doctrines and and different things
[57:36] but if they're true Servants of God
[57:38] they're doing it for Godly motives and
[57:41] godly objectives I see when you look at
[57:43] the Lord Jesus you can see that John
[57:46] said he that said upon Him must call
[57:47] faithful and true and in righteousness
[57:50] he doth judge and make war
[57:54] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[57:57] his head were many crowns which mean he
[58:00] had many victories and he had a name
[58:03] written that no man knew but he himself
[58:08] and he was closed with a vesture dipped
[58:12] in blood now of course one symbol after
[58:14] the other after the other
[58:16] a vesture dipped in Blood and his name
[58:20] is called the word of God now his name
[58:23] is not the word of God in this instance
[58:26] but his name is rather called the word
[58:30] of God notice in verse 14 and the armies
[58:35] which were in heaven wow so there's more
[58:37] than one
[58:39] the armies which were in heaven followed
[58:43] him
[58:44] upon white horses
[58:46] clothed and fine linen
[58:50] White
[58:51] and clean
[58:52] may the Lord bless his word you may be
[58:55] seated
[59:01] here is the symbol
[59:03] of the final victory
[59:07] to be obtained over the Beast
[59:10] over the false prophet
[59:13] and the Triumph of the church
[59:17] and who is leading this Mighty Conquest
[59:21] the Lord Jesus himself
[59:24] by this time the world has almost been
[59:28] annihilated
[59:29] there's been Atomic Warfare that has
[59:33] destroyed Rome
[59:35] but yet there's some characters here
[59:37] that are still living now let me just go
[59:41] ahead and be honest with you tonight I
[59:43] can't say that I know who all the
[59:46] characters and the Revelation in the
[59:47] Book of Revelation are because they
[59:50] switch back and forth and go from one
[59:52] symbol and one type to another some of
[59:55] them are quite plain others of them
[59:57] aren't them but I find this part of this
[1:00:01] passage of scripture quite amazing
[1:00:03] because he's coming to annihilate
[1:00:06] somebody
[1:00:08] somebody is fixing to experience the
[1:00:11] wraths and the word of God and as we all
[1:00:15] know if he's got killing on his mind
[1:00:17] ain't no place you can hide
[1:00:20] so I don't want to be on that side that
[1:00:23] he's looking for you now there's a
[1:00:26] division of what he's going to conquer
[1:00:29] and who he's going to conquer he's
[1:00:32] coming to be able to annihilate the
[1:00:37] Beast and the false prophet which are
[1:00:40] not the same
[1:00:41] they are actually going to be thrown
[1:00:44] into the Lake of Fire which burns with
[1:00:49] fire and brimstone
[1:00:51] but yet that's not the devil because the
[1:00:55] devil will reappear in a thousand years
[1:00:58] so we've got the symbol of the Beast
[1:01:01] we've got the symbol of the false
[1:01:03] prophet the Roman papal Authority by
[1:01:07] this time has already been annihilated
[1:01:09] because of the prophecy that was
[1:01:13] fulfilled as we saw in Revelation 18. so
[1:01:16] John focuses on what he sees coming open
[1:01:19] and he saw the heavens open and
[1:01:23] Revelation 4 he saw the heavens open and
[1:01:27] the bride went up and Revelation 19 he
[1:01:32] saw the heavens opened and he saw the
[1:01:34] bride and the bridegroom come down
[1:01:38] so it depends on which cycle it is when
[1:01:41] Heaven opens because it's like it's
[1:01:43] opens the curtains as it was and the
[1:01:47] scene changes from one thing to another
[1:01:50] now John says he that set upon him was
[1:01:54] called faithful and true so he doesn't
[1:01:57] designate him by his name Lord Jesus
[1:02:00] Jesus Christ or Lord Jesus Christ but he
[1:02:04] designates him by certain
[1:02:07] characteristics and traits by which he
[1:02:10] wants us to know who he is so he's
[1:02:13] faithful and he's true and then John
[1:02:17] says and righteousness doth he judge and
[1:02:20] make war now all of his acts of judgment
[1:02:24] are determining of course the destiny of
[1:02:27] men I realize we're living in an age
[1:02:29] whenever the liberal teachers and the
[1:02:31] liberal false prophets and sad to say
[1:02:34] but even some in the message they want
[1:02:36] to preach all about Grace and mercy and
[1:02:39] forgiveness and tolerance and so on and
[1:02:42] so on and to preach about judgment and
[1:02:45] the wraths of God well you're really not
[1:02:47] duck well you're looking at one real odd
[1:02:50] duck tonight because that's what I'm
[1:02:51] going to preach about
[1:02:52] because I still believe that God is
[1:02:56] going to execute wraths on the
[1:02:58] unbelievers and annihilate the wicked
[1:03:02] now if people in the message fall into
[1:03:05] that category they'll be burnt up just
[1:03:07] like the whoremongers just like the
[1:03:10] pedophiles just like the homosexuals and
[1:03:13] everybody else so you're not going to
[1:03:15] hide behind the shelter or I believe God
[1:03:18] sent a prophet anybody could say that
[1:03:20] from their mouths and still not obey
[1:03:23] what he said so you're not going to be
[1:03:25] free from the wraths of God in the last
[1:03:27] days because you're setting in a message
[1:03:30] Church you're going to be free from the
[1:03:32] wraths of God because you have got the
[1:03:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the blood
[1:03:37] of the Lord Jesus speaks for your soul
[1:03:40] and when God hears that petition of
[1:03:43] yours he doesn't even hear your prayer
[1:03:46] he hears the voice of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:48] that's wonderful is it not now notice
[1:03:51] John says that he's going to come to
[1:03:54] judge and to make war now the war which
[1:03:58] he wages as I said is not a war of
[1:04:02] ambition it is not a war to be able to
[1:04:05] take over somebody's property he's not
[1:04:08] like Putin to where he wants the Ukraine
[1:04:11] he's not like Napoleon where he wanted
[1:04:14] this land and that land he's not like
[1:04:17] many of the Great conquests that have
[1:04:19] been down through time but it is a war
[1:04:22] but it is a war which will be sent forth
[1:04:26] in righteousness and this war was
[1:04:29] decreed by almighty God himself and I'm
[1:04:33] glad to say tonight I believe we are
[1:04:36] going to be in the side of the right
[1:04:38] when this war begins the purpose of this
[1:04:42] Conquest is not to take people's wives
[1:04:46] people's children it's not to take their
[1:04:49] gold their silver their land their
[1:04:51] houses or their property but it is to
[1:04:55] execute the rest of God on those who
[1:04:58] have turned down his mercy and when we
[1:05:01] finally turn down his Mercy for now at
[1:05:04] this stage even the foolish virgin the
[1:05:06] church the denominational system has
[1:05:09] moved out of her into him now you see
[1:05:13] while it's still in her the prophet
[1:05:16] tells us there is Mercy but if your name
[1:05:19] is found on that stalk book when he
[1:05:23] comes too late it will be and once it
[1:05:27] moves out of her into him and him as
[1:05:31] Satan of course then it will be too late
[1:05:34] there will be no more Mercy for the
[1:05:37] Gentiles but while there's yet Mercy
[1:05:39] even though people people are in a
[1:05:41] denomination God can still deal with
[1:05:43] them and call them out of that system as
[1:05:46] he did US is that right so shine your
[1:05:49] life wherever you are let your light so
[1:05:51] shine before men that they may see your
[1:05:54] good works and glorify your father which
[1:05:57] is in heaven notice the way Jesus said
[1:05:58] that that he didn't say they would hear
[1:06:01] your doctrine that they will tell you
[1:06:03] how you can explain this or explain that
[1:06:05] but they would see your good works and
[1:06:08] they would glorify God by seeing God
[1:06:11] inside of your life
[1:06:14] but now when it reaches Revelation 19
[1:06:17] he's come now not in Mercy he's not come
[1:06:21] to be able to give people one last time
[1:06:25] a pardon no the world has already
[1:06:28] crossed the line between mercy and
[1:06:31] judgment so now he's come to make war
[1:06:34] now friend I know all of us have had
[1:06:37] great battles with the devil we've had
[1:06:39] tremendous battles with demon spirits
[1:06:42] and we've all had these things that
[1:06:44] we've dealt with our entire walk with
[1:06:47] God as Christians but let me tell you
[1:06:49] none of that would even compare to
[1:06:52] having God against you and just remember
[1:06:55] Satan is against you hell is against you
[1:06:58] people are against you but I'd rather
[1:07:00] have all of them against me than God
[1:07:03] against me
[1:07:05] because there's no winning when God is
[1:07:08] against you now Christ and his armies
[1:07:12] are riding force in this conquest of
[1:07:15] Victory notice how John describes him
[1:07:18] and this of course goes into the
[1:07:20] Sevenfold personage of his deity in
[1:07:23] verse 12 his eyes were as a flame of
[1:07:27] fire and he on his head were many crowns
[1:07:30] and he had a name written that no man
[1:07:33] knew but himself and he was clothed with
[1:07:36] a vesture that was dipped in Blood and
[1:07:40] his name is called the word of God now
[1:07:43] what we see is actually the ushering end
[1:07:46] of the great day now God is showing John
[1:07:49] a symbol of how a conqueror would have
[1:07:53] wrote in in this days of John so John
[1:07:56] sees him in this vision and he sees the
[1:07:59] the Lord Jesus setting upon this great
[1:08:02] white charger and he sees as it would
[1:08:05] have been in and that day the apparel of
[1:08:07] the time so a conqueror would have come
[1:08:10] through and he would had a vesture and
[1:08:13] unlike this one which was dipped in
[1:08:15] blood it would have been gold and silver
[1:08:18] maybe if he'd taken Libya and Morocco
[1:08:21] and many different places he would have
[1:08:23] taken taken a jewel from the crown of
[1:08:26] the king of Morocco he would have taken
[1:08:28] one from the diadem of maybe the
[1:08:31] princess of Mesopotamia and then he
[1:08:34] would have this engraved in his armor so
[1:08:38] when he come in he would sit there and
[1:08:40] they would have this long flowing
[1:08:42] garment and he would have his name
[1:08:44] actually embroidered in His Garment as
[1:08:48] it would flow down both sides so then
[1:08:51] when he would set upon this horse they
[1:08:53] would have his britches as it was and he
[1:08:56] would have His Garment parted here at
[1:08:58] the waist part of it going down this
[1:09:00] side part of it going down this side a
[1:09:03] crown it would have a gem from this
[1:09:05] Crown a Ruby from this Crown all of them
[1:09:08] were signifying his great conquest and
[1:09:12] his victory and there he would have as
[1:09:15] it was Napoleon Bonaparte or Julius
[1:09:18] Caesar or whoever it was but this one
[1:09:21] here he comes and his name is called the
[1:09:25] word of God
[1:09:26] notice as John sees this and the prophet
[1:09:31] picks it up in the uh patmosphere in the
[1:09:33] church each book and he said today is
[1:09:36] certainly not the Lord's day but this is
[1:09:39] man's day it's man's doing man's work
[1:09:43] man's Church man's idea of worship man's
[1:09:49] everything for it is man's world Cosmos
[1:09:52] but the day of the Lord is coming I mean
[1:09:56] he understands the day of the Lord is
[1:09:57] not here yet but it is coming yes it is
[1:10:01] it is just at this time of the
[1:10:04] revelation of Jesus Christ that John is
[1:10:06] caught up in the spirit and transported
[1:10:10] by the spirit into the great day of his
[1:10:13] coming so John was actually by the
[1:10:16] spirit of God caught up into the fourth
[1:10:19] dimension where the prophets would see
[1:10:21] their Visions in the fourth dimension of
[1:10:23] course is where television Wives come
[1:10:25] through radio waves where many any of
[1:10:27] these waves if they finally broke into
[1:10:29] it's the same Dimension where sicknesses
[1:10:31] are and in that Dimension it's like
[1:10:34] there's no tomorrow no yesterday you
[1:10:37] have access to all of that that's why a
[1:10:39] prophet could look there and see a woman
[1:10:41] standing before him 60 years old by
[1:10:43] Vision he can look back and see her 12.
[1:10:46] and said I see you running you're coming
[1:10:48] home from school you've got on the
[1:10:50] yellow check address I see you run up on
[1:10:53] the porch there's a dog after you you'll
[1:10:55] open the door you fall through the door
[1:10:57] and it caused a fear on you and you've
[1:11:00] dealt with that fear your entire life
[1:11:02] now he would go back in time and see her
[1:11:05] as a little girl then he sees her as she
[1:11:07] is and then he sees her as she will be
[1:11:10] and he watches as the vision keeps on
[1:11:13] and he can say thus saith the Lord but
[1:11:16] your well why because he could see an
[1:11:18] older woman and he didn't see the end of
[1:11:20] her life at the age of 60 that she was
[1:11:22] so John is now caught up into the day of
[1:11:26] the Lord Lord so John is seeing what
[1:11:29] we're fixing to experience 2 000 years
[1:11:32] ago he saw it the Lord's Day is when the
[1:11:35] day of man is over the kingdoms of the
[1:11:39] world become the kingdoms of our God the
[1:11:41] day of the Lord is when the judgments
[1:11:44] fall
[1:11:45] think what a paradox the day of the Lord
[1:11:48] is when the judgments fall oh brother
[1:11:51] sister let me be hidden Jesus Christ and
[1:11:54] after that comes the Millennium right
[1:11:58] now the world does what it wants to with
[1:12:00] the Christian they called him all manner
[1:12:03] of evil names making fun of him but
[1:12:05] there's coming a great and notable day
[1:12:07] they will wail and howl for the notable
[1:12:11] day will come and the lamb is coming to
[1:12:14] judge the world what a paradox that the
[1:12:17] lamb is coming to judge the world now
[1:12:21] the way the majority of Christendom
[1:12:22] preaches the lamb the only way they
[1:12:25] preach him is in Mercy and in
[1:12:28] forgiveness and he tolerates everything
[1:12:30] in the world my goodness time they get
[1:12:32] done with all the Toleration of
[1:12:34] abomination they're every single in the
[1:12:36] world will walk down Heaven There won't
[1:12:38] even be no separation between right and
[1:12:40] wrong everybody lives like the devil and
[1:12:43] lives like hell and then whenever they
[1:12:44] do whatever of the day whether it's a
[1:12:46] country music singer or a Hollywood star
[1:12:48] a rock and roll star they want some
[1:12:50] preacher to preach them in the gates
[1:12:52] I'll preach them in the gates too cause
[1:12:54] sheol in Hades
[1:12:57] well if you don't live right you're not
[1:12:59] walking down the streets of gold I don't
[1:13:01] care who you are
[1:13:02] that's exactly like come on somebody say
[1:13:04] Amen if you want to get to heaven you've
[1:13:07] got to live a Godly life
[1:13:09] my mind but you see it's the age of man
[1:13:13] now watch it goes on to say the wicked
[1:13:15] shall burn and the righteous shall walk
[1:13:18] over their ashes into the Millennium and
[1:13:21] then he quotes Malachi 4 3 you shall
[1:13:23] tread down the wicked and they shall be
[1:13:25] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[1:13:30] the day that I shall do this says the
[1:13:33] Lord of hosts now you know this is
[1:13:35] Malachi 4 3. well I'm so glad Malachi 4
[1:13:38] 3 that part don't apply to me but
[1:13:41] Malachi 4 5 and 6 does
[1:13:45] so pick out whichever verse you want I
[1:13:47] pick out five and six that's me now
[1:13:50] watch it you know it was something that
[1:13:52] God got several of the Old Testament
[1:13:55] prophets into this same vision and even
[1:13:58] though they would record various parts
[1:14:00] of what was going to happen but many of
[1:14:03] them Isaiah Joel I become second of
[1:14:06] zephanage Zechariah many of them they
[1:14:08] use this same terminology the day of the
[1:14:11] Lord they knew there was a time coming
[1:14:13] but God only showed them part of it and
[1:14:16] they wasn't really sure what it was now
[1:14:19] whether you're a post-millennious
[1:14:21] pre-millennious or no millennialist you
[1:14:23] know when it comes right down to it we
[1:14:25] have to come back and base our Doctrine
[1:14:27] upon the word of God is that right so
[1:14:30] it's easy to see why that people would
[1:14:33] think that there was a post-millennial
[1:14:35] and a premillennial in other words some
[1:14:37] will sink the coming of the Lord will be
[1:14:39] before the Millennium something will be
[1:14:41] I to the Millennium and I'm talking
[1:14:43] about some message people too because
[1:14:44] I'm of us asked a few years ago by a
[1:14:47] young group of people in the message had
[1:14:48] been born and raised in the message all
[1:14:51] they knew was the message they wasn't
[1:14:52] even sure and they asked me the question
[1:14:54] Harry was that with me they wasn't even
[1:14:56] sure if the Rapture was going to be
[1:14:58] before the Millennium or after them I
[1:15:00] thought what a shame they've been born
[1:15:01] and raised in the message and they don't
[1:15:03] even know when it's going to be well
[1:15:05] I'll tell you I believe we better know
[1:15:07] and we better get ready for it
[1:15:09] now watch Isaiah 13 6 says it this way
[1:15:12] how ye how isn't that what a dog does
[1:15:17] isn't that what an animal does so people
[1:15:21] of course do it too and it's not that
[1:15:24] they're setting their
[1:15:28] oh I'm so tore up I'm just
[1:15:31] oh give me my hanky
[1:15:37] oh judgment is coming oh mud
[1:15:41] the Earth is going to be burned up they
[1:15:44] will scream
[1:15:45] they will holler they will how they will
[1:15:50] lament there's no way we can imagine how
[1:15:54] bad it's going to be
[1:15:56] I'm just hoping I'm not preaching to
[1:15:58] anybody tonight that's going to be here
[1:16:01] how are you for the day of the Lord
[1:16:05] is at hand now can you imagine
[1:16:07] Isaiah prophesied this about 700 years
[1:16:12] before the Lord Jesus ever come on the
[1:16:15] earth this has been 27
[1:16:17] 2800 years ago
[1:16:21] and he's saying the day of the Lord is
[1:16:23] going to come and when it does people
[1:16:26] are going to howl and he said it shall
[1:16:29] come as a destruction from the almighty
[1:16:33] verse 9 behold the day of the Lord
[1:16:36] cometh cruel
[1:16:39] cruel
[1:16:41] both with wraths
[1:16:43] and fierce anger
[1:16:46] have you ever heard the smiley preacher
[1:16:48] from Texas preach this
[1:16:52] the way he preaches it every devil Out
[1:16:54] of Hell will be saved I believe even all
[1:16:57] the demons will get saved
[1:16:59] well I hate to let Mr Smiley know no
[1:17:02] they won't and a lot of his congregation
[1:17:05] and him with it if he don't get right
[1:17:06] ain't going to be there himself
[1:17:09] well glory to God well come on you know
[1:17:12] what I'm talking my friends it's a
[1:17:13] social gospel and the further we get in
[1:17:15] time the worse it gets everything's gray
[1:17:18] anymore people don't gonna call this
[1:17:20] right and call that wrong you bunch a
[1:17:23] jelly-back Christians and gotten a more
[1:17:26] standard than that we need to take a
[1:17:28] stand for God's word and say what God's
[1:17:31] word said is right man ain't right
[1:17:34] Church ain't right no Society ain't
[1:17:37] right but let every word that God said
[1:17:41] be amen by the saints of God and say God
[1:17:45] is right and man is wrong I don't care
[1:17:49] who the man is
[1:17:52] oh my
[1:17:54] notice behold the day of the Lord cometh
[1:17:58] cruel
[1:17:59] you mean the Lord
[1:18:01] is going to bring a cruel day
[1:18:04] cruel
[1:18:05] both with rats and fierce anger
[1:18:09] to lay the land desolate
[1:18:12] and he shall destroy
[1:18:15] the sinners
[1:18:17] thereof out of this some of them by
[1:18:19] nuclear explosion
[1:18:21] in the time of Rome and the rest of them
[1:18:24] that are alive will be annihilated by a
[1:18:28] nuclear fire and some of them their
[1:18:31] bodies will not be annihilated and
[1:18:34] totally destroyed
[1:18:36] and God will invite Birds
[1:18:41] by the thousands and tens of thousands
[1:18:44] and hundreds of thousands
[1:18:49] to come and eat them
[1:18:54] I find this quite a paradox because the
[1:18:57] first half of Revelation 19
[1:18:59] is pointing to the marriage supper the
[1:19:02] last half of Revelation 19
[1:19:05] is pointing to the vulture supper
[1:19:10] so Revelation 19 is suppertime
[1:19:13] isn't it amazing that this was not
[1:19:15] called breakfast time in Revelation 19
[1:19:19] why the sun has set him it's the end of
[1:19:23] man's day so at the setting of the Sun
[1:19:26] what is the last meal of the day
[1:19:28] suppertime so God is going to call for
[1:19:33] all of these birds to come and they will
[1:19:36] Feast on captains they will Feast on
[1:19:41] corporals and lieutenants and popes and
[1:19:45] Bishops and false pastors and false
[1:19:48] prophets I wish somebody preached with
[1:19:50] me tonight
[1:19:52] oh my notice in verse 10 for the stars
[1:19:56] of Heaven
[1:19:58] and the constellations thereof shall not
[1:20:01] give their life the sun shall be
[1:20:04] darkened of his going force and the moon
[1:20:08] shall not cause her life to shine notice
[1:20:11] that the sun is masculine gender and the
[1:20:14] Moon is feminist
[1:20:17] now I realize that don't go in the woke
[1:20:19] Society but we don't fit in the woke
[1:20:21] Society we are in the awoke Society we
[1:20:26] have been awoken from the dead
[1:20:29] so I don't want to woke I've been awoke
[1:20:32] Hallelujah I have been quick and I once
[1:20:36] was asleep but I'm not asleep no more I
[1:20:39] got woke up by that Great Mighty angel
[1:20:42] of Revelation 10. I've heard the voice
[1:20:45] of the bridegroom say come out of her my
[1:20:47] people
[1:20:48] [Applause]
[1:20:51] now notice this loving gentle wonderful
[1:20:53] sweet God what he says he'll do
[1:20:57] I will punish
[1:20:59] the world
[1:21:01] for their evil and the wicked for their
[1:21:04] iniquity
[1:21:06] and I will cause the arrogancy of The
[1:21:10] Proud to cease
[1:21:12] and will lay low the haughtiness of the
[1:21:17] Terrible
[1:21:19] so you're eating up with pride you
[1:21:20] better get rid of it
[1:21:22] you're holding think you're better than
[1:21:24] somebody else because you're worth more
[1:21:25] and your house is nicer and you drive a
[1:21:28] nicer car you better get rid of it this
[1:21:31] is what God said he's going to do to you
[1:21:32] after a while
[1:21:34] well come on children
[1:21:37] I will make a man
[1:21:40] more precious
[1:21:42] than fine gold
[1:21:45] praise be to God now we're talking about
[1:21:47] real value I will make a man more
[1:21:51] precious than find gold even a man more
[1:21:55] a man that will be even worse more value
[1:21:58] than the golden wedge of othar so now
[1:22:03] we're looking at real value that God
[1:22:05] says I will make one man worse more than
[1:22:09] gold which people have killed for people
[1:22:11] have murdered for Kings have conquered
[1:22:14] for it go right it's been the currency
[1:22:16] of the world for millennium but God said
[1:22:19] I'll show you what real value is I'll
[1:22:23] make one man worse more than go case you
[1:22:26] see friend why that the Lord Jesus looks
[1:22:29] at the bride and he values her at such
[1:22:32] value she's valued Way Beyond rubies and
[1:22:35] pearls and the wealths and the riches of
[1:22:38] this world and God gives us an inkling
[1:22:40] here by the prophet Isaiah that God
[1:22:42] would come to a Time on the earth that
[1:22:44] he would have a people on the Earth
[1:22:46] whose value would surpass look this
[1:22:50] little gathering of people right here
[1:22:52] tonight much less all the thousands
[1:22:55] times thousands that are Washed by the
[1:22:57] bloody word around the world this little
[1:22:59] handful of people and it is a small
[1:23:01] handful come compared to the 8 billion
[1:23:03] people that are on the Earth but yet we
[1:23:06] are worse more than Fort Knox 500 000
[1:23:10] times over
[1:23:11] but yet people rubbed shoulders with us
[1:23:13] every day and they don't see no value in
[1:23:16] US they don't see that we're worth
[1:23:18] nothing why a bunch of Knuckleheads wow
[1:23:20] that's a skirt church this this that and
[1:23:22] the other but one of these days we're
[1:23:24] gonna find out I'm worth more than a
[1:23:26] wedge of old for I'm worth more than a
[1:23:29] wedge of the bank of Tennessee or the
[1:23:32] bank of Jonesboro praise the Lord you
[1:23:34] little Daughters of God you sons of God
[1:23:37] oh my we got nothing to brag about in
[1:23:40] our cell but what the Lord God is
[1:23:43] minting in our soul you see the Lord God
[1:23:46] is minting in our soul the gold of
[1:23:50] Christ like character it cannot be held
[1:23:54] in four knocks it cannot be produced in
[1:23:56] the Deep minds of South Africa it can
[1:23:59] only be produced by the grace of God and
[1:24:02] the predestinated heart that says Lord
[1:24:06] Make Me Like You make me like you and
[1:24:10] through the test of God and the battles
[1:24:12] of life God molds you and he saved you
[1:24:15] and he makes you and he will have a
[1:24:18] bride that is worse more than the gold
[1:24:21] of the world
[1:24:23] [Applause]
[1:24:29] oh thank God
[1:24:31] therefore I will shake
[1:24:34] the heavens
[1:24:37] and the Earth shall remove
[1:24:41] out of her place
[1:24:44] well of course she has to
[1:24:47] you see in the original
[1:24:49] he made her where she stood straight up
[1:24:53] she was not tilted on her axis in 23.5
[1:24:56] degrees the way she is now and actually
[1:24:59] she wobbles as she spins
[1:25:03] were it not for the son being on the
[1:25:06] average of 239 000 miles from the Earth
[1:25:10] changes somewhat
[1:25:12] but the Moon is what keeps it in his
[1:25:15] spot the sun 93 million miles away
[1:25:19] and the Earth's great
[1:25:22] orbit being kept in its position if it
[1:25:25] was not for the moon and the
[1:25:27] gravitational pull of the moon it would
[1:25:30] do like a top and it would Spin and spin
[1:25:34] you notice your kids you probably don't
[1:25:36] even make them anymore but I remember
[1:25:37] seeing them at the little tops and you
[1:25:39] push the button how many has ever seen
[1:25:41] one like that
[1:25:42] what year was you born
[1:25:44] so you pushed that little top how many
[1:25:46] you got people have absolutely no idea
[1:25:48] what I'm even talking about
[1:25:51] you push that little top and it spins
[1:25:53] and spins but as it slows down it starts
[1:25:56] going this way and then eventually it'll
[1:25:58] just turn over that's the way the Earth
[1:26:00] would be wear it not for the
[1:26:01] gravitational pull of the moon this is
[1:26:04] why you need a church and a Godly Pastor
[1:26:07] because the Moon is like the church and
[1:26:10] the world will pull you out of orbit and
[1:26:13] cause you go to wobbling here and
[1:26:14] wobbling there but the church says all
[1:26:17] glory The Fellowship of the saints of
[1:26:19] God and gathering together and a pasture
[1:26:21] that won't cut Corners well Hallelujah
[1:26:24] that'll preach the Full Gospel and the
[1:26:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost when you go to
[1:26:28] wobbling and getting out of line with it
[1:26:30] and say hey hey hey hey get back up
[1:26:32] there tops come on top so stand upright
[1:26:35] let's stand that pinch Spin and worship
[1:26:38] God hallelujah
[1:26:42] so what's going to happen this great
[1:26:44] nuclear explosion will take place on the
[1:26:47] Earth
[1:26:48] and the Earth will go so it'll go oh oh
[1:26:51] there it goes and all of a sudden it'll
[1:26:54] go
[1:27:04] it should be perfectly on her pose again
[1:27:09] and then we'll have major global warming
[1:27:21] why it was the same temperature all the
[1:27:23] way around the Earth
[1:27:25] that's why they can dig in the
[1:27:26] Antarctica and all them different places
[1:27:28] I've still got a piece of shale that
[1:27:30] brother that brother Bobby Hayden gave
[1:27:33] me years and years ago I'm sure
[1:27:34] remembers it it got it out of a coal
[1:27:36] mine I forget how many feet that it was
[1:27:38] down that brother Bobby found this and
[1:27:40] it was a it was a a branch of a fern and
[1:27:44] just perfectly imprinted in that Shale
[1:27:46] and you know how deep was it how long
[1:27:49] had it been that I've told you before
[1:27:51] but Carol and I went into a gold mine
[1:27:53] and South Africa went way down a shaft I
[1:27:55] mean just out down An Elevator Shaft
[1:27:57] that abandoned coal mine and then you go
[1:27:59] down and this train ever so far and then
[1:28:01] they bring it to a spot and then they
[1:28:02] stop it and then they tell you to look
[1:28:04] up and when you look up you're looking
[1:28:05] up like this and it's a gigantic
[1:28:08] footprint of a dinosaur so here's this
[1:28:11] dinosaur's footprint right up on the
[1:28:13] ceiling and no he wasn't laying on his
[1:28:15] back playing this during the destruction
[1:28:17] sometime but there it was embedded in
[1:28:20] the solid rock it speaks of another
[1:28:22] civilization another world world that
[1:28:25] was already existed well praise the Lord
[1:28:28] the thing of it is we don't know how
[1:28:30] many times this Earth has already been
[1:28:32] through this cycle and we know the
[1:28:34] prophet tells us that those seeds there
[1:28:35] in Genesis 1 that they were there from
[1:28:38] some former civilization because it
[1:28:41] types you as the elect of God oh you
[1:28:44] don't remember it and I don't remember
[1:28:45] it either but that see Gene inside of
[1:28:48] you come from another world it existed
[1:28:51] before you ever existed in this life as
[1:28:53] a mortal human being it was there in the
[1:28:56] mind of God you wasn't a boy or a girl
[1:28:58] walking around of course but you existed
[1:29:00] in the mind of God but now you are made
[1:29:03] manifest Hallelujah we were out there
[1:29:06] wobbling around in the world wobbling
[1:29:08] around but the spirit of God got a hold
[1:29:10] of us and shut us up on our north-south
[1:29:13] axis and he gave us the baptism of the
[1:29:16] Holy Ghost and he took the wobble out of
[1:29:19] her singing he took the wobble out of
[1:29:21] our walking he took the wobble out of
[1:29:23] our belief in he took the while a lot of
[1:29:25] our walk with God and set us on a
[1:29:28] straight path and said come on children
[1:29:30] come on children follow me back to the
[1:29:33] promised land
[1:29:44] so God said I will shake
[1:29:49] the heavens
[1:29:51] and the Earth shall remove out of her
[1:29:54] place in the Wrath
[1:29:58] of the Lord of hosts
[1:30:02] you say this is part of what the new
[1:30:04] birth is like that people don't really
[1:30:06] like about him
[1:30:08] they much rather like you just come up
[1:30:10] and give the minister your hand what in
[1:30:12] the world do I want with your old dirty
[1:30:13] Paul
[1:30:15] don't give me your hand you'll need it
[1:30:18] give the preacher your hand well I put
[1:30:20] my name on the church book I've done
[1:30:22] this or that you've got to die
[1:30:24] don't you understand the wrath of God
[1:30:27] has to fall on this Earth before it can
[1:30:29] become into a new image the wrath of God
[1:30:32] listen to you must be born again 1961
[1:30:34] and you hear how the prophet describes
[1:30:36] it about coming up to the Altar and
[1:30:38] there the wraths of God falls on you
[1:30:40] don't you understand this is why so many
[1:30:42] people are just accepting an
[1:30:44] intellectual conception around the
[1:30:45] message well I believe God sent a
[1:30:47] prophet and I believe and I believe and
[1:30:49] I believe and that's all the message is
[1:30:51] look friend it was not a doctrine that
[1:30:53] died for us it was not a doctrine that
[1:30:56] raised from the dead it is not a
[1:30:58] Doctrine that's coming back after us it
[1:31:00] was a person that came it was a person
[1:31:03] that died it was a person that rose
[1:31:06] again it is a person that's coming back
[1:31:09] for the bride
[1:31:12] come on
[1:31:16] when the Judgment of God falls on your
[1:31:20] soul at the altar it annihilates you
[1:31:27] you're finished
[1:31:31] you don't get up
[1:31:32] well I'm going to wean myself from a
[1:31:34] winstons
[1:31:36] instead of smoking 13 I'm gonna smoke 12
[1:31:39] and a half tomorrow
[1:31:40] and the next week I'll try for 12. and
[1:31:44] I'm going to get a self-help book for a
[1:31:46] Christian I'm going to get a self-help
[1:31:48] book for how to get rid of my porn and a
[1:31:51] self-help book of how to quit this and
[1:31:53] quit that I got that self-help book many
[1:31:55] many years ago and I tell you it don't
[1:31:57] work
[1:31:58] you've tried the same one I'm sure it's
[1:32:00] all altered by the same author the Devil
[1:32:03] Himself there's only one book that can
[1:32:05] help ourself it'll need a self-help book
[1:32:08] it's a self-dye book and it's called the
[1:32:10] Bible
[1:32:11] it's not helping yourself that'll do it
[1:32:13] it's letting yourself die under the rise
[1:32:16] of God then you can be born anew
[1:32:20] oh the Judgment of God Must Fall on the
[1:32:23] Earth
[1:32:28] the Judgment of God Must Fall
[1:32:30] on the earth and the heavens will shake
[1:32:33] and tremble and the earth oh God oh God
[1:32:38] the Earth has experienced his judgment
[1:32:40] many times remember I want to know I
[1:32:42] said that and preached and the Earth
[1:32:45] repented oh God I'm sorry God I'm sorry
[1:32:48] God forgive me God forgive me
[1:32:51] God said all right I accept your
[1:32:53] repentance and God baptized the Earth
[1:32:56] hold your nose
[1:33:01] and here come this big sphere about of
[1:33:04] this baptismal pool of water
[1:33:08] but it didn't take long
[1:33:10] the man got back on it
[1:33:12] started messing it up again
[1:33:15] why the Earth didn't get the fire she
[1:33:18] got the water
[1:33:20] well Glory some folks around the message
[1:33:22] got the water and got a tape and thought
[1:33:24] they got it all once they got that but
[1:33:26] if you ain't got no fire I'm telling you
[1:33:28] them tapes by themselves are not going
[1:33:30] to get you in
[1:33:32] well preach brother Tony
[1:33:36] now look Isaiah saw this also on this
[1:33:38] fold and Isaiah 63 1.
[1:33:41] who is this that cometh
[1:33:43] from Edom
[1:33:45] with God
[1:33:48] garments from beau's raw
[1:33:52] who is this
[1:33:54] that Cometh From Edom with god notice
[1:33:58] how this is spelled d-y-e-d died
[1:34:01] so these garments that he has on or died
[1:34:05] with something well what is it the blood
[1:34:09] the blood
[1:34:10] that's amazing because he can appear in
[1:34:13] a twofold way with garments with blood
[1:34:16] on them because he appears to the broad
[1:34:19] this way too but he says he tread The
[1:34:22] Wine Press of the wrath of God and when
[1:34:24] the bride looks at him she knows that he
[1:34:27] did this in a substitutionary way and
[1:34:29] he's got blood on him because he tread
[1:34:33] The Grapes of God for her
[1:34:36] but when John sees him in Revelation 19
[1:34:38] he's got died garments on but this time
[1:34:41] I didn't for the bride
[1:34:43] he comes and wraths and he's got the
[1:34:46] blood of his enemies all over him
[1:34:50] oh my goodness
[1:34:53] who is this that Cometh From Edom what
[1:34:56] died garments from Boze roll this that
[1:34:59] is glorious in his apparel traveling in
[1:35:02] the greatness of his strength I that
[1:35:05] speak in righteousness Mighty to say
[1:35:08] wherefore art thou read in thine apparel
[1:35:12] and thy garments like him that treadst
[1:35:15] the wine fat now this seems very unusual
[1:35:18] to us but this is the setting of them
[1:35:22] making wine so they would take the
[1:35:24] grapes and when the grapes would get
[1:35:26] right they would put them in what they
[1:35:29] called a wine press we saw some of them
[1:35:32] actually we were Israel and they found
[1:35:33] one that was very close to the little
[1:35:35] city of Nazareth and you couldn't keep
[1:35:37] from thinking my the Lord Jesus may have
[1:35:39] seen this himself thousands of years old
[1:35:41] so they would either put another piece
[1:35:44] of stone on top of it or they would take
[1:35:46] their shoes off and they would get
[1:35:49] inside it like this
[1:35:51] and they were tread on these grapes and
[1:35:55] they'd smash them and smash them and
[1:35:58] smash them and keep on smashing and as
[1:36:01] they begin to squeeze the blood as they
[1:36:04] called it out of the grapes they would
[1:36:06] have a little pipe that would come down
[1:36:08] and you'd go to see a drop a drop
[1:36:11] another drop two drops three drops four
[1:36:13] drops and then a little tiny Trickle and
[1:36:16] then a stream but the thing of it is the
[1:36:18] person doing the treading is getting
[1:36:21] that all over them
[1:36:24] they are becoming part of this and you
[1:36:26] know Isaiah sees him not so much coming
[1:36:28] for the bride but he says I am coming to
[1:36:32] introduce the day of the Lord
[1:36:36] I am coming to tread upon the wicked
[1:36:40] Vince you understand one day Johnson
[1:36:42] City the Holiday Inn Word of Life Church
[1:36:46] every other building ever sign of
[1:36:48] civilization will be totally annihilated
[1:36:51] off the Earth
[1:36:53] there will be no Great Sphinx or
[1:36:56] pyramids there will be no Fifth Avenue
[1:36:58] in New York it will totally be gone
[1:37:05] oh my
[1:37:07] notice the question that Isaiah asked
[1:37:10] this person in verse two wherefore art
[1:37:13] thou read
[1:37:15] in thine apparel
[1:37:17] and thy garments like him that tread Us
[1:37:21] in the wine fact and then this person
[1:37:24] answers I have trodden The Wine Press
[1:37:27] alone
[1:37:28] and of the people there was none with me
[1:37:31] for I tread them in my anger
[1:37:35] and trample them in my Fury and their
[1:37:39] blood shall be sprinkled on my garments
[1:37:42] you see this is an attribute of the Lord
[1:37:45] God
[1:37:46] the preacher's just more hardly preach
[1:37:48] about
[1:37:49] it's like God was this mean tyrant in
[1:37:51] the Old Testament and then the New
[1:37:53] Testament God went up to an altar some
[1:37:55] words that I need to repent oh I'm a bad
[1:37:58] God I'm a mean God I'm a hateful
[1:38:01] contrario God I think I'll go to my boy
[1:38:04] you know he's so kind and I'm so mean so
[1:38:07] I'm going to go to my little boy and say
[1:38:09] little boy would you please save me you
[1:38:11] heathen
[1:38:16] this is prophecy
[1:38:20] and it lays right in front of us
[1:38:27] look the parallels how close they are
[1:38:30] so here in this setting he has the blood
[1:38:33] of people on him
[1:38:36] but the bride is the opposite of this
[1:38:39] she has the blood of him on her
[1:38:46] that's what I will I don't want my blood
[1:38:49] on him because if my blood's on him it
[1:38:51] means he's mad at me and he's out to get
[1:38:54] me
[1:38:55] let his harass thought on me now
[1:38:59] I believe it happened to me years ago
[1:39:01] when the wrath of God fell on my nature
[1:39:06] oh Hallelujah
[1:39:08] when the wrath of God fell on my nature
[1:39:12] and God was angry was who I was he was
[1:39:16] angry was what I was
[1:39:18] and the fire of God broke loose on my
[1:39:22] nation their God slayed my first husband
[1:39:27] and set me free from that Old Union
[1:39:31] Hallelujah
[1:39:32] praise the Lord
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:38] oh
[1:39:40] he said notice this
[1:39:42] in my Fury and their blood shall be
[1:39:45] sprinkled upon my garments and I will
[1:39:49] stain all my raiment
[1:39:52] for the day of vengeance
[1:39:55] is in my heart
[1:39:57] and the year of my redeemed
[1:40:03] praise the Lord
[1:40:05] so here he's fighting mad at somebody
[1:40:07] and in love with somebody else
[1:40:12] he's come talking about judgment and
[1:40:15] wrath and blood
[1:40:18] but he says oh yeah let me not get all
[1:40:20] caught up in this but let me tell you
[1:40:22] what this is all about this is the year
[1:40:25] of the redeemed
[1:40:30] notice in verse 6 that I will tread down
[1:40:34] the people
[1:40:37] I wish friends
[1:40:38] you could get people to see it
[1:40:42] it's just so sad
[1:40:44] and make them drunk in my Fury
[1:40:47] and I will bring down their strengths
[1:40:50] to the Earth
[1:40:53] my goodness
[1:40:55] Jeremiah 10 10.
[1:40:58] but the Lord
[1:41:00] is the true God
[1:41:03] I love this the Lord is the true God he
[1:41:07] is the Living God and an everlasting
[1:41:11] King at his wrath the Earth shall
[1:41:15] tremble and the nation shall not be able
[1:41:18] to abide
[1:41:19] his indignation
[1:41:22] this is one of the compound names of
[1:41:25] Jehovah Adonai Jehovah yah and it is
[1:41:29] Elohim he met
[1:41:33] e-m-e-t and it means god
[1:41:37] the god of Truth
[1:41:40] now you see it's one thing to have the
[1:41:43] truth of God
[1:41:44] I don't just want the truth of God I
[1:41:47] want the god of Truth
[1:41:49] amen because all kinds of people have
[1:41:52] had the truth and turned it away and
[1:41:54] walked away from it that's right but if
[1:41:56] you've got the god of the truth you'll
[1:41:58] have the love of the truth with you
[1:42:00] that's right you have Jehovah Elohim he
[1:42:04] met and he is resident in your soul
[1:42:07] that's why you can sit here and you're a
[1:42:10] sermon like this tonight and you say
[1:42:12] well praise God I hate it it's really a
[1:42:14] bad deal I'll feel sorry for those
[1:42:16] that's going to be here but he ain't
[1:42:18] talking about me tonight because I don't
[1:42:21] plan on being here I'm going to be
[1:42:23] coming back with the Lord Jesus on a
[1:42:26] white horses and we're representing a
[1:42:28] power because I have already met him in
[1:42:31] Wrath and my own nature is dead the old
[1:42:34] man has died years ago and I buried him
[1:42:38] in the form of baptism and I raised from
[1:42:41] the dead to a new life and I'm waiting
[1:42:44] for my body to be changed hallelujah
[1:42:47] amen my blood ain't going to be on him
[1:42:50] because his is on me
[1:42:54] praise God if his blood's on me I'm safe
[1:43:00] I'm secure
[1:43:03] oh
[1:43:05] notice Joel 1.
[1:43:08] verse 15. alas
[1:43:11] for the day
[1:43:13] for the day of the Lord is at hand can
[1:43:15] you imagine
[1:43:16] thousands of years ago they said this
[1:43:20] the day of the Lord is at hand well in
[1:43:22] God's time it's only been a couple days
[1:43:25] yeah so it isn't it
[1:43:28] notice the fervency and the urgency of
[1:43:31] the Prophet no doubt when the people
[1:43:32] heard this Vindicated Prophet they saw
[1:43:34] they don't even plant no taters they
[1:43:36] don't even planting on Mayors it's
[1:43:37] coming I mean it's right upon us
[1:43:40] they urgency must have so gripped the
[1:43:42] hearts and for some of them it was right
[1:43:44] upon them because someone probably
[1:43:45] didn't live to see the next day
[1:43:48] notice the day of the Lord is at hand as
[1:43:51] a destruction from the almighty shall it
[1:43:55] come chapter 2 verse 1. below ye the
[1:43:58] trumpet in Zion and sound an alarm in my
[1:44:02] Holy Mountain let all of the inhabitants
[1:44:05] of the land tremble for the day of the
[1:44:08] Lord cometh
[1:44:09] for it is not at hand a day of Darkness
[1:44:14] and of gloominess
[1:44:16] wow
[1:44:18] how many has ever heard the coming of
[1:44:19] the Lord preached like this before
[1:44:26] we're not afraid of truths are we
[1:44:29] a day of darkness and of cluminess a day
[1:44:32] of clouds and a thick Darkness as the
[1:44:36] mourning spread upon the mountains a
[1:44:38] great people and a strong that there has
[1:44:41] not been ever the like neither shall
[1:44:44] there be any more after it even to years
[1:44:48] of many generations
[1:44:52] what a parallel so you got a bad Gloom
[1:44:55] in time and then you got a bunch of
[1:44:57] people on the Earth that there ain't
[1:44:58] never been none like them and never will
[1:45:01] be again
[1:45:02] Joel chapter 2 verse 11 and the Lord
[1:45:05] shall utter his voice
[1:45:07] listen children
[1:45:09] the Lord shall utter his voice
[1:45:12] before
[1:45:14] his army
[1:45:16] for his camp
[1:45:18] yes very great
[1:45:20] Glory for he is strong that executes his
[1:45:25] word for the day of the Lord is great
[1:45:27] and very terrible
[1:45:30] and who
[1:45:32] can abide it
[1:45:37] well Joel asked that question a long
[1:45:39] time ago
[1:45:40] let me give you the answer
[1:45:42] the elect of God will
[1:45:46] you will abide the day of the Lord
[1:45:50] the wrath of God
[1:45:52] the Vengeance of God
[1:45:55] Obadiah
[1:45:56] chapter 1 verse 15 for the day of the
[1:45:59] Lord is near
[1:46:00] upon all the Heathen well praise God
[1:46:03] that leaves me out
[1:46:05] I used to be a trinitarian heathen but I
[1:46:07] ain't one no more
[1:46:09] as thou Hast done it shall be done unto
[1:46:11] thee thy reward shall return upon thine
[1:46:14] own head for as she have drunk upon my
[1:46:17] Holy Mountain so shall all the Heathen
[1:46:20] drink continually yay they shall drink
[1:46:22] and they shall swallow down and they
[1:46:24] shall be as though they had not been
[1:46:26] but upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance
[1:46:30] and there shall be Holiness and the
[1:46:33] house of Jacob shall possess their
[1:46:36] possessions
[1:46:38] the great day of the Lord is near it is
[1:46:40] near and hastes greatly notice
[1:46:45] what a time is coming
[1:46:48] the wrath of God the Judgment of God
[1:46:52] well how come y'all ain't howling
[1:46:55] why aren't y'all terrified well some of
[1:46:57] you ought to be if you ain't living
[1:46:58] right
[1:46:59] but the majority of you are sitting here
[1:47:02] tonight and look at them and say what in
[1:47:03] the world's matter brother Donnie and he
[1:47:05] eats something bad and hurt his belly
[1:47:06] ain't nothing wrong with my belly I'm
[1:47:08] telling you the truth
[1:47:09] this is what's fixing to come on this
[1:47:12] Earth that we love this is what's fixing
[1:47:14] to happen to your family this is what's
[1:47:16] fixing to happen to your friends your
[1:47:18] employees your employer if they do not
[1:47:21] hear the word of God and will they all
[1:47:22] hear it they won't but thank God you
[1:47:25] have ears to hear and not only that but
[1:47:27] a heart to obey what you have heard
[1:47:30] don't be a forgetful hearer James said
[1:47:32] and listen and hear what you were and
[1:47:34] walk out and forget it but all my other
[1:47:35] really elect of God they're not forgiven
[1:47:37] for hearers they are obeyers to the word
[1:47:41] thank you Lord Jesus notice this in
[1:47:44] Zechariah 1 14 the great day of the Lord
[1:47:46] is near it is near and hasteth greatly
[1:47:49] even The Voice
[1:47:51] of the day of the Lord The Voice
[1:47:55] of the day of the Lord the mighty man
[1:47:58] shall cry their ability there is a day
[1:48:00] is a day of rest a day of trouble and
[1:48:02] distress
[1:48:04] my God a day of wastedness and
[1:48:07] desolation a day of darkness and
[1:48:10] gloominess a day of clouds and thick
[1:48:12] darkness in an amazing these prophets
[1:48:14] probably never even knew each other
[1:48:15] never even read one another's writings
[1:48:18] but they prophesied the same words
[1:48:22] second Peter 3 10 and we'll close
[1:48:25] but the day of the Lord will come now
[1:48:28] for those of you who think this is only
[1:48:29] the Old Testament
[1:48:32] the day of the Lord will come as a thief
[1:48:34] in the night
[1:48:35] into which the heavens
[1:48:37] the heavens
[1:48:40] shall pass away
[1:48:42] with a great noise
[1:48:45] and the elements
[1:48:47] shall melt
[1:48:49] now remember this is
[1:48:51] pre-nuclear Bomb this is before they
[1:48:54] ever understood anything about the
[1:48:57] dividing of an atom
[1:48:59] but listen the way Peter describes this
[1:49:02] and it's a nuclear explosion
[1:49:08] the heavens shall pass away
[1:49:11] now we talk about nuclear bombs and
[1:49:13] they're often they're terrible but do
[1:49:15] you understand the Cobalt bomb
[1:49:18] the Cobalt bomb is so much more
[1:49:21] dangerous than the nuclear bomb they've
[1:49:24] got things that absolutely probably
[1:49:26] scare most Mortals to death are they
[1:49:29] talking they rattle their swords and
[1:49:31] rattle their swords but remember one day
[1:49:33] it'll be more than talk this scripture
[1:49:36] will be fulfilled and when it does the
[1:49:39] heavens themself not the heaven but the
[1:49:42] heavens will shake the elements the
[1:49:45] stars the constellations oh Lord God
[1:49:49] the heavens shall pass away
[1:49:54] with a great noise
[1:49:56] so the Fallout will go up so high the
[1:50:00] cloud and it will start igniting the
[1:50:02] heavens what is it filled with these
[1:50:04] gases and the heavens
[1:50:06] the gases and the heavens will pass away
[1:50:15] and catch on fire
[1:50:18] hmm
[1:50:19] and the elements shall melt
[1:50:22] with fervent Heat
[1:50:25] and the Earth also
[1:50:29] and the works that are therein
[1:50:31] shall be
[1:50:33] burned up
[1:50:39] so in reality
[1:50:41] when that day comes
[1:50:43] what will we have left
[1:50:46] as the people of God
[1:50:48] much of the things that we have sought
[1:50:50] for and labored for and struggle for
[1:50:53] it won't even matter
[1:50:56] people have stolen lied and connived and
[1:50:59] cheated and done this and that and the
[1:51:01] other and when this day rolls around it
[1:51:03] will be as if though they were like the
[1:51:05] beggar on the street
[1:51:06] the person in the streets of Mumbai
[1:51:09] which I've been there used to be called
[1:51:10] Bombay and you see tens of thousands of
[1:51:13] people on the streets there the main
[1:51:15] streets the very main streets and they
[1:51:18] got cardboard boxes they got pieces of
[1:51:20] tarpaulin they got pieces of metal
[1:51:22] roofing which is a high-class place to
[1:51:24] live and if you've got a piece of metal
[1:51:25] roofing and there's thousands and
[1:51:27] thousands and thousands of people that
[1:51:30] line those streets and there's so many
[1:51:31] of them they cannot get rid of them
[1:51:33] they're homeless they have no place to
[1:51:35] live but when this day rolls around
[1:51:37] there won't be one bit of difference
[1:51:39] between them and somebody that lives in
[1:51:41] a penthouse on Fifth Avenue it will all
[1:51:43] be the same can you imagine their
[1:51:46] eyeballs will melt and fall out of their
[1:51:48] skull their skin will fall off what a
[1:51:50] terrible day is coming you're going to
[1:51:52] face the wraths of God then or you face
[1:51:55] it now at the altar I'm glad I took mine
[1:51:58] at the altar
[1:51:59] Hallelujah
[1:52:01] don't you love him
[1:52:03] let's stand
[1:52:06] thank you Lord
[1:52:10] thank you Lord
[1:52:13] notice this in Revelation 19 14 in the
[1:52:16] armies which were in heaven followed him
[1:52:17] upon white horses clothed in fine linen
[1:52:20] white and clean and out of his mouth
[1:52:22] goeth a sharp sword
[1:52:25] that with it he should smite
[1:52:28] the Nations
[1:52:30] as I begin to look at this and study I
[1:52:33] found it was so amazing the parallel of
[1:52:36] how the believer meets him and when the
[1:52:38] believer meets him versus when the world
[1:52:41] meets him so somebody's going to meet
[1:52:43] him he's going to have blood on him or
[1:52:45] they're going to have blood on them
[1:52:47] here
[1:52:48] out of his mouth goes a sharp sword and
[1:52:52] it will slay the Enemy by the thousands
[1:52:56] he won't let nuclear explosions take
[1:52:58] care of all of it out of his mouth the
[1:53:01] word will go forth and thousands times
[1:53:03] thousands will die
[1:53:06] he's providing the supper for the birds
[1:53:13] not me
[1:53:16] not you
[1:53:19] but
[1:53:21] one day
[1:53:23] that word
[1:53:24] went out of his mouth
[1:53:27] cut me to my
[1:53:33] it's so red my life
[1:53:36] and got me
[1:53:38] and when that old nature that old
[1:53:41] husband
[1:53:42] began to agree with God's word
[1:53:45] what did he do he slayed him on the
[1:53:49] altar
[1:53:53] the sword out of his mouth
[1:53:55] killed
[1:53:57] my nature
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:01] and I'll come off of that altar
[1:54:03] a new person
[1:54:06] so you'll be killed here
[1:54:08] or killed here
[1:54:12] I choose mine here
[1:54:15] out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword
[1:54:18] that with it he should Smite the Nations
[1:54:21] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[1:54:24] iron
[1:54:25] he treadeth The Wine Press of the
[1:54:29] fierceness of the rest
[1:54:32] of almighty God
[1:54:35] he tries now notice again twofold here
[1:54:38] he's treading it but who is it he's
[1:54:41] liking the wine press now to the wicked
[1:54:45] or before he was treading your sins
[1:54:49] here is the Lamb of God coming to the
[1:54:51] world he said I tread The Wine Press of
[1:54:54] the wrath of God Alone myself
[1:54:57] so there he was with all your lying all
[1:55:00] that your adultery all of your sins and
[1:55:02] he was right there in the middle of it I
[1:55:04] kill that adultery I kill that Obsession
[1:55:07] of pornography I killed that devil oh my
[1:55:10] God it all over me come out and say I've
[1:55:13] conquered it for you Donnie
[1:55:17] I've conquered him for you young ladies
[1:55:19] I've got the blood of your grapes all
[1:55:22] over me now you are free
[1:55:26] [Applause]
[1:55:38] but you see now it's fixing to introduce
[1:55:41] the millennium
[1:55:43] so he's going to tread on sinners
[1:55:46] tread on governments
[1:55:48] tread on society
[1:55:50] tread on everything they've done
[1:55:54] and he will fill the Beast and the false
[1:55:56] prophet and the fire which burns with
[1:55:59] brimstone
[1:56:00] Brimstone was used as a form of incense
[1:56:05] to purge the unclean
[1:56:09] you see those who have died
[1:56:11] for millennia
[1:56:12] they don't go to a burning Lake of Fire
[1:56:14] remember the parable Jesus gave it was
[1:56:17] just a parable the prophet said God
[1:56:18] never sends a man to a burning fire
[1:56:20] without first judging him
[1:56:22] well what's amazing is they go to Hades
[1:56:25] she old of the Old Testament Hades a
[1:56:28] prison house
[1:56:30] but the Beast and the false prophet go
[1:56:33] straight to the Lake of Fire
[1:56:36] apparently they've done been judged
[1:56:40] and they go into fire and brimstone
[1:56:43] oh my what is it incense coming up on
[1:56:47] the Earth
[1:56:48] coming with the nuclear fallout
[1:56:51] glory to God
[1:56:53] and all of a sudden there will be an
[1:56:55] earth that will merge and when she
[1:56:58] merges out of all of that you imagine
[1:56:59] now the prophet they asked him what
[1:57:01] would the bride be when this takes place
[1:57:03] he said he'll carry away somewhere he
[1:57:05] didn't know exactly where it was but
[1:57:06] lift the bride off the Earth while all
[1:57:09] these explosions are going on all this
[1:57:11] Atomic stuff and the Earth have begin to
[1:57:13] belch out like she did in the beginning
[1:57:15] no my unlike Lowe's in Home Depot we got
[1:57:18] to go build a house and this and that
[1:57:20] and we go over and buy this and buy that
[1:57:21] but God allowed the building materials
[1:57:24] to churn out of the bosom of the Earth
[1:57:25] in the beginning as she began to bolts
[1:57:28] the volcanic ash out of her all glory to
[1:57:31] God and whenever it comes on the
[1:57:33] Millennium and we will step out on the
[1:57:35] ashes of the wicked and the Earth will
[1:57:37] be back to her Eden condition again
[1:57:41] praise God
[1:57:44] praise God
[1:57:46] oh I wish it could happen today
[1:57:49] but mother Donnie we're so close to
[1:57:50] being in our new church forget our new
[1:57:52] church the coming of the Lord my
[1:57:55] goodness I ain't got one plan and I hope
[1:57:56] you don't don't take press and know
[1:57:58] everything in life the coming of the
[1:58:00] Lord supersedes everything
[1:58:02] praise be to God it'd be fine with me if
[1:58:04] we work like dogs and get that thing
[1:58:06] ready and we have to start the first
[1:58:08] service and Jesus said come on home
[1:58:09] youngins come on home come on up to my
[1:58:12] house that's fine with me any tune
[1:58:15] praise God
[1:58:17] that's about it
[1:58:21] it's Lord God
[1:58:25] how many of you tonight but no one
[1:58:27] looking around you want to be remembered
[1:58:29] he said Lord I I don't want to be here
[1:58:31] in this terrible time
[1:58:33] that we've heard talked about tonight
[1:58:36] I don't want to be here Lord
[1:58:39] oh God I raised both of my hands
[1:58:42] we don't want to be here Lord
[1:58:46] oh Hallelujah
[1:58:48] we want your blood to be on our garments
[1:58:51] not ours on yours
[1:58:54] Hallelujah
[1:58:57] let's arouse of God
[1:58:59] fall on us in this life
[1:59:02] help us Lord
[1:59:04] May the wraths of God meet us at the
[1:59:07] altar somewhere
[1:59:10] speak judgment upon that worldly nature
[1:59:14] praise God and right there that nature
[1:59:18] dies
[1:59:21] nor do we don't want to just shake hands
[1:59:22] with a preacher pick up a book and
[1:59:24] accept this Doctrine and that Doctrine I
[1:59:27] believe God sent a prophet all that's
[1:59:28] important that's part of it but we know
[1:59:31] we must be born again
[1:59:34] Hallelujah Lord we don't want to get
[1:59:36] people to shout we don't want to get
[1:59:38] them to emotional things we're speaking
[1:59:40] in tongues we want to get them to a new
[1:59:42] birth then let them shout then let them
[1:59:44] speak in tongues if the Holy Ghost gives
[1:59:46] it to them
[1:59:47] we don't want to accept no substitute
[1:59:49] whatsoever where it's intellectual of
[1:59:51] the mind or emotion of the spirit
[1:59:53] we want to make sure that old man is
[1:59:56] dead
[1:59:58] oh Lord if there's one here tonight or
[2:00:00] many if there's one or many under the
[2:00:02] sound of my voice it's streaming this at
[2:00:04] her archiving father in the name of
[2:00:06] Jesus May the spirit of God meet them at
[2:00:10] the altar
[2:00:12] let that brother that sister in the
[2:00:14] office that one driving a car maybe
[2:00:16] they're going down through Africa
[2:00:17] wherever they are Lord God
[2:00:19] oh heavenly father in the name of Jesus
[2:00:22] May the spirit of God deal with your
[2:00:25] children draw us Lord
[2:00:28] the hour is coming a dreadful Time Lord
[2:00:32] there's no way we can talk about it and
[2:00:34] make it real enough to describe what's
[2:00:36] coming
[2:00:37] oh but Jesus hide us
[2:00:40] hide us father
[2:00:42] to the death angel passes through
[2:00:45] Lord God let it let our Our Lives be
[2:00:48] covered in your blood let our sins be
[2:00:50] annihilated father in the blood of the
[2:00:53] Lamb of God
[2:00:55] there's one here tonight Lord that's not
[2:00:57] ready to meet you father May the spirit
[2:01:00] of God deal with them
[2:01:01] Lord maybe they've got cold and
[2:01:03] different May the Holy Spirit I pray
[2:01:06] touch them right here tonight
[2:01:08] Lord God you tread the wine press
[2:01:12] alone
[2:01:13] you got our filth
[2:01:16] our unrighteousness all over you
[2:01:20] you have to become a man
[2:01:22] you couldn't die as God
[2:01:24] you couldn't Dodge the eternal
[2:01:27] but you had to die in the form of
[2:01:29] sonship a man
[2:01:32] so in the form of sonship you tread all
[2:01:34] over our sins
[2:01:36] you tread all over our habits
[2:01:39] and you got them all over you
[2:01:41] and this is why Spirit God had to turn
[2:01:44] his back as it were on you
[2:01:46] and you had to die alone on the cross
[2:01:48] Eli Eli lemon
[2:01:50] my God my God why is Thou forsaken me
[2:01:56] because you had
[2:01:58] tread The Wine Press of God
[2:02:01] and God's judgment was on you
[2:02:03] God's Wrath was on you
[2:02:06] and God had to send you to hell
[2:02:12] O Lord Jesus thank you
[2:02:17] you were the creature of love the
[2:02:19] creature of Mercy the creature the
[2:02:21] creation of God's compassion
[2:02:24] but the prophet tells us that you
[2:02:25] forsook your sonship
[2:02:27] you let go of all you were
[2:02:30] to take our sin upon you
[2:02:34] Hallelujah you become us that we might
[2:02:38] become you
[2:02:39] you become a sinner that we might become
[2:02:42] children of God
[2:02:45] and when you look down and saw the Wrath
[2:02:48] of the grapes
[2:02:51] the dispensation of judgment that was on
[2:02:53] you
[2:02:54] you knew there was only one place
[2:02:58] Heaven could not receive you
[2:03:01] you had the blood of grapes on you
[2:03:04] you could not go straight to heaven
[2:03:08] you had to go straight to hell
[2:03:13] oh Jesus
[2:03:16] oh Jesus thank you
[2:03:20] thank you Lord God
[2:03:24] so you died out of the presence of God
[2:03:27] and became a curse
[2:03:30] and I hear the prophet say demonology
[2:03:31] part two paragraph 199 when I think of
[2:03:34] how Jesus when he died
[2:03:36] with our sins on him he died the death
[2:03:38] of a sinner
[2:03:40] and God because of his sins sent him
[2:03:45] to hell
[2:03:49] but you went to hell
[2:03:51] so we don't have to
[2:03:55] you tread The Wine Press of the wrath of
[2:03:57] God
[2:03:58] so we don't have to
[2:04:01] all we got to do is just meet you at
[2:04:03] that altar let the wrath of God fall on
[2:04:05] that nature and there it does
[2:04:08] and a little spot about the size of a
[2:04:11] button
[2:04:12] comes inside of our soul as it were
[2:04:15] and we start making these new steps
[2:04:18] toward our theophany
[2:04:22] praise the Lord
[2:04:24] we worship you tonight Lord God
[2:04:28] don't you love him children
[2:04:30] I hope he makes it more real to you
[2:04:32] tonight than it's ever been before
[2:04:34] that he died for you
[2:04:37] he took your place
[2:04:39] took your sin become your sins
[2:04:43] that you can stand here tonight and say
[2:04:45] I'm free
[2:04:48] I am no longer a sinner I'm no longer
[2:04:52] bound by Satan but I am free
[2:04:56] I'm washed I'm clean
[2:05:00] praise be to God
[2:05:03] oh we worship you Lord God
[2:05:06] lead us Lord Jesus
[2:05:09] then lead us through the word
[2:05:11] what is the little reproach that we bear
[2:05:14] in this life for you
[2:05:16] to even be worthy to be compared for the
[2:05:19] reproach of our sins and guilt that you
[2:05:22] bore for us
[2:05:24] you died a curse in the eyes of almighty
[2:05:27] God
[2:05:28] the Angels couldn't even stand to look
[2:05:30] at you
[2:05:32] because you were so sinful not because
[2:05:34] of what you've done but because of what
[2:05:36] you become for he who knew no sin became
[2:05:40] our sin
[2:05:41] oh Lord God that we might become the
[2:05:45] very righteousness of God in him
[2:05:48] oh Jesus we worship you tonight father
[2:05:51] no wonder
[2:05:52] that one day when the redeem starts
[2:05:54] singing those songs that the angels will
[2:05:57] back out of that presence and they'll
[2:05:59] circle the Earth and bow their heads as
[2:06:02] we go to singing about the Redemption
[2:06:04] power of God
[2:06:06] but Lord we don't want to wait to that
[2:06:07] hour we want to sing about it right here
[2:06:10] tonight
[2:06:11] we want to tell you we love you
[2:06:14] forgive me for complaining Lord forgive
[2:06:17] me for complaining about my cross and
[2:06:19] how heavy it gets sometimes what's what
[2:06:22] have I been through compared to what you
[2:06:24] suffered for me

[2:06:45] how he deserves Our Praise
[2:06:48] can you just imagine him in your mind

[2:07:11] of your ungodliness his feet hit your
[2:07:14] cousin his feet hit all of that and the

[2:07:21] all over him your impurities your
[2:07:23] unrighteousness all of your wrongdoing
