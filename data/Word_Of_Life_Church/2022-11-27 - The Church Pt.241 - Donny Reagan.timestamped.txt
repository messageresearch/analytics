[38:02] I mean those are being in his presence
[38:04] can change us forever
[38:06] and we will allow it to
[38:13] second Samuel chapter 12 verse 1.
[38:16] and the Lord sent Nathan unto David
[38:20] and he came unto him and said unto him
[38:23] there were two men in one city the one
[38:25] rich
[38:27] and the other poor
[38:29] the rich man had exceeding many flocks
[38:33] and herds
[38:37] but the poor man had nothing
[38:39] say one little
[38:41] you lamb
[38:43] which he had bought
[38:46] and nourished up
[38:48] and it grew together with him and with
[38:51] his children
[38:53] it did eat of his own meat
[38:56] and drank of his own cup
[38:58] and lay in his bosom
[39:01] and was unto him
[39:03] as a daughter
[39:05] and there came a traveler unto the rich
[39:07] man
[39:08] and he spared to take
[39:11] of his own flock and of his own hurt
[39:15] to dress for the wayfaring man that was
[39:19] come unto him
[39:21] but took the poor mans
[39:23] lamb
[39:24] and dressed it for the man
[39:27] that was come to him
[39:30] I mean Dr B remembered today as we pray
[39:33] just hold your need in your heart
[39:37] heavenly father as we
[39:40] come into your great presence
[39:43] we are so thankful that you're mindful
[39:45] of us
[39:46] Lord Jesus we're asking you
[39:50] take your word and speak to us
[39:53] open our hearts
[39:56] we are
[39:57] very grateful that you
[40:00] have allowed your book called The Bible
[40:04] to be written of true stories
[40:07] most happy and sad
[40:11] both the types of stories that make us
[40:13] rejoice
[40:15] and the type that make us repent
[40:19] we're thankful that it is not
[40:22] fictitious or made up of some people's
[40:25] imagination
[40:27] but it was you who inspired the authors
[40:29] to write it we love it we thank you for
[40:33] it
[40:34] we ask you to be mindful of the needs
[40:36] today of those that are present we know
[40:38] we have many that are sick flu and flu
[40:41] symptoms and viruses and things like
[40:43] that that are going around but we pray

[41:24] influential

[41:46] with many of the Great Kings
[41:50] during this time

[41:59] as the prophet Nathan comes to
[42:02] bring this story to him
[42:05] I don't know how but
[42:08] somehow he had been able to
[42:10] convince himself for about a year now
[42:14] that he will still okay with God
[42:17] which is more than I can comprehend I
[42:20] trust it is you
[42:21] that a man that loved the Lord so much
[42:25] a man the only man that we have recorded
[42:29] in the scripture that says he was a man
[42:32] after God's Own Heart
[42:35] very beautiful and yet unusual title for
[42:39] any Immortal to have
[42:41] but in this stage of his life
[42:44] is not that same man
[42:47] in one way we look back in retrospect
[42:50] and you're able to see that it was
[42:53] through this LAX type of condition in
[42:57] his life
[42:58] the time when the Kings go out to war
[43:00] and David had not done that
[43:03] so he was trusting maybe too
[43:05] overconfident
[43:07] too much looking to the blessing of God
[43:10] and thinking well you know I'm in a good
[43:13] state right now nothing can happen to me
[43:16] I'm so blessed the lord loves me so much
[43:21] so he enters into this very dangerous
[43:24] time
[43:26] we know that trials can be so difficult
[43:30] and trials can be devastating
[43:34] but after looking at when people get
[43:36] into the lacks time of their life they
[43:39] aren't going through trials
[43:42] I think I prefer trials
[43:45] most of the time the people of God it
[43:48] was not when they were going through
[43:50] such tests and such trials that they
[43:54] fell away but it was when they got lacks
[43:57] when they got cold and different when
[44:01] they were so blessed as we would say
[44:03] they were so happy and you know they
[44:06] become a little bit loose with sir walk
[44:10] with the Lord and this is where we can
[44:12] see that David was
[44:15] now as we pick up where we were last
[44:19] week I'm sure that most of you were
[44:22] quite shocked as I was and I've talked
[44:25] to several this week and
[44:27] um by by text by email by what's out by
[44:31] all types of communication from
[44:33] different people around the world
[44:35] I've come to find out I wasn't the only
[44:38] one that was shocked about David and
[44:41] Bathsheba now in my thinking I've always
[44:45] thought such Grace such Mercy to
[44:50] Bathsheba
[44:53] but after Sunday my view has changed
[44:56] somewhat now I'm thinking such Grace
[44:59] such Mercy to David
[45:07] and we know that God
[45:09] has no problem
[45:12] in identifying women
[45:16] in sin and calling them out
[45:20] so it's not that God had some sort of
[45:23] issue in identifying Bathsheba and her
[45:28] wrong and in her sin
[45:30] but as we read the parable again here
[45:33] this morning if you notice and I'm sure
[45:36] you did that God never blamed Bathsheba
[45:41] for any of this
[45:42] but God identifies her as a few lamb a
[45:49] lamb
[45:50] so you would not call a prostitute a
[45:54] lamb
[45:55] you would not call even Tamar a lamb
[46:01] you would not identify someone like
[46:05] Rahab and I hope it doesn't stumble you
[46:07] but even in the New Testament of
[46:10] carrying over the story of Rahab both in
[46:13] the book of Hebrews and in the Book of
[46:15] James Rahab is still called a prostitute
[46:21] now it's not that the blood coming
[46:23] through the cross did not wipe away her
[46:27] old identity and why the authors chose
[46:29] to still identify her under that name I
[46:34] can't say that I rightly know but all I
[46:37] know is that God allowed these women to
[46:41] be part of the genealogy of the human
[46:45] birth of our savior
[46:48] and for those of you who study genealogy
[46:51] I'm sure you know that it was through
[46:55] the son Solomon that God bought part of
[46:59] the genealogy but not all
[47:02] you see God had also pronounced judgment
[47:07] against one of the seed of David
[47:10] because of his idolatry and God said not
[47:15] one of his seed was set on my throne
[47:19] that one was through the lineage of
[47:23] Solomon
[47:24] but remember David and Bathsheba had
[47:28] another son
[47:30] his name was Nathan
[47:33] Nathan
[47:35] begat children the genealogy kept coming
[47:38] till we come down to the Book of Matthew
[47:42] Joseph come through Solomon's lineage
[47:48] but Mary came through Nathan's
[47:51] both Joseph and Mary were of the seed of
[47:57] David
[47:58] had Mary been of the seed of Solomon
[48:03] the Lord Jesus could have never been the
[48:06] heir
[48:07] to David's throne David remember God
[48:11] promised him
[48:13] friends this is when sovereignty steps
[48:16] in and overshadows man's ignorance
[48:21] I'm so glad he's had to do it he's done
[48:24] it for me is he done it for you
[48:27] so God allowed both Joseph and Mary to
[48:32] be of the genealogy but yet it was
[48:36] through Mary read it when you get time
[48:38] when you read the genealogy there in the
[48:40] Book of Matthew and how that Matthew
[48:43] pins it and writes it down of each one
[48:45] of those women and he changes the
[48:47] terminology when he comes to Mary and he
[48:51] says of whom of whom Jesus was born
[48:58] which is called the Christ
[49:01] God in his sovereignty stepped in and
[49:05] allowed Mary also to come of the
[49:08] genealogy of David that it might be
[49:11] fulfilled he would fulfill and be of the
[49:15] tribe of David even call the son of
[49:18] David can you imagine God allowing
[49:21] himself to come through a man like David
[49:26] all before like Sunday we all had no
[49:29] problem with that I mentioned that for
[49:31] many of you it was the same as it was
[49:33] with me that to be honest with you David
[49:36] was one of my favorite Heroes of the Old
[49:40] Testament
[49:42] and I think Hollywood helped shape all
[49:45] of this in us that we can find it easier
[49:49] to forgive the man than we can the woman
[49:52] [Music]
[49:53] y'all going to preach on there look at
[49:55] me
[49:56] so for David to be forgiven and David to
[50:01] be you know the great Giant Killer and
[50:04] David the mighty a psalmist of Israel
[50:08] and David the harpist and David all of
[50:11] this and that but to accept the fact
[50:14] that David was a sheep stealer
[50:18] and David was a premeditated murderer
[50:26] that's hard on our iconic view isn't it
[50:32] now watch in Genesis chapter 3 verse 11.
[50:36] when Adam and Eve had done wrong notice
[50:40] how God addresses the woman
[50:44] in this wrongdoing
[50:46] and he said who told thee that thou was
[50:49] naked hast thou eaten of the tree
[50:51] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[50:53] shouldest not eat and the man said the
[50:57] woman
[50:58] whom thou gave us to be with me now
[51:01] notice man after the fall he doesn't
[51:04] take the blame but in one sense of the
[51:07] word he blames God forgiving her to him
[51:11] the woman whom thou gave us to be with
[51:13] me she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[51:18] and the Lord God said unto the woman the
[51:23] knitted amazing when God sends Nathan
[51:26] the prophet he does not send her to both
[51:30] David and Bathsheba
[51:33] we have no record that Nason ever even
[51:37] addresses Bathsheba in this wrong wonder
[51:41] why
[51:42] she was not the aggressor
[51:45] I hope you can understand it she was
[51:47] actually innocent
[51:50] overpowered by a strong aggressive
[51:54] leader
[51:56] well praise the Lord
[51:59] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[52:03] what is this that thou Hast done so God
[52:08] has no problem in addressing women when
[52:12] they aren't wrong right God has no
[52:15] problem in communicating and even
[52:17] indicting them so God personally
[52:20] indicted Adam God personally indicted
[52:23] Eve and God could speak directly to her
[52:26] and yet why does not God do that in the
[52:29] case of David and Bathsheba unless the
[52:33] scenario is different what is this that
[52:37] thou has done and the woman said the
[52:40] serpent beguiled me and I did eat of
[52:44] course as we say both of them are
[52:46] passing the buck until it comes to the
[52:48] serpent and he asked nobody to pass it
[52:51] on to
[52:53] Ahab and Jezebel in First Kings 21 17.
[52:58] and the word of the Lord came to Elijah
[53:01] the Tish by saying
[53:03] arise go down to meet Ahab king of
[53:06] Israel which is in Samaria behold he's
[53:09] in the vineyard of nabos whether he has
[53:11] gone down to possess it you remember the
[53:14] story but to save time you read it when
[53:17] you get time and thou shalt speak unto
[53:19] him saying thus saith the Lord hast thou
[53:22] killed and also taken possession
[53:26] and thou shalt speak unto him saying
[53:29] thus saith the Lord in the place where
[53:32] the dogs licked the blood of nabos shall
[53:36] the dogs lick thy blood even thine verse
[53:41] 23 and of Jezebel also spoke the spake
[53:46] the Lord saying the dogs
[53:49] shall eat Jezebel
[53:52] by the wall of Jezreel
[53:56] so God has no problem addressing women
[53:59] as well as men you agree
[54:02] so why doesn't God do that in this case
[54:07] notice again Paul in the New Testament
[54:09] first Timothy 5 6 addressing not a woman
[54:12] just by name but women in general but
[54:16] she that liveth and pleasure is dead
[54:20] while she liveth again Revelation 17 16
[54:24] and the ten horns which thou solest upon
[54:27] the Beast these shall hate the
[54:30] which what we've been dealing with on
[54:31] Wednesday night and shall make her
[54:33] desolate and naked and shall eat her
[54:36] flesh and burn her with fire so God has
[54:41] no issues no qualms whatsoever in
[54:45] addressing either individual women or
[54:48] women as a category or women as it was
[54:51] here which is wrong so God surely would
[54:55] have had no problem in addressing
[54:58] Bathsheba had Bathsheba been guilty but
[55:02] in the parable the mystery that lays in
[55:06] the parable that Nathan gives to David
[55:09] shows both guilt and innocence now
[55:13] unlike today to where that women are
[55:17] getting more and more of their rights of
[55:19] course and I agree that some of them did
[55:22] need more even coming in the New
[55:25] Testament we find that Paul even though
[55:29] many of the people want to call Paul a
[55:31] woman hater yet Paul actually placed the
[55:35] women of the New Testament in a higher
[55:38] category in Christ Jesus than they ever
[55:41] had in the Old Testament he wrote more
[55:44] about their Liberty in Christ more about
[55:46] their Liberty and the baptism of the
[55:49] Holy Ghost so where these women get that
[55:51] Paul was a woman hater I don't
[55:52] understand it at all he was one of the
[55:55] greatest liberators of the New Testament
[55:57] but not liberators in the sense of sin
[56:01] but liberators in the sense of the
[56:04] Gospel like
[56:05] so God then would have no problem
[56:08] because he's the same one that anointed
[56:10] Paul so he gives Nathan this Parable and
[56:14] he identifies Bathsheba as well he calls
[56:18] back again to second Samuel 12 3 the
[56:21] poor man had nothing saved one little
[56:23] you lamb so he identifies Uriah the
[56:28] hittite as being the pastor now notice
[56:32] this God is going to take a pastoral
[56:35] synetting a setting rather which was
[56:37] something David would have been able to
[56:39] relate to and I hope you understand this
[56:41] that brother Branham makes this comment
[56:43] and how can overcome when he was talking
[56:46] about lot and lot's why and he said your
[56:49] pastor is your husband spiritually
[56:52] speaking now I want you to think of this
[56:56] in this light then that in the Old
[56:58] Testament scenario it was in a similar
[57:01] sense that Uriah the hittite which was
[57:05] her husband would have also been her
[57:08] pastor he would have been the one that
[57:11] would have been leading the flaw now he
[57:13] had a small flock it consisted of his
[57:16] young wife and it all so consisted of
[57:20] children that were still in the home
[57:23] that had been brought to the Earth in
[57:26] between Uriah and his first wife
[57:29] so he raised up Bathsheba along with
[57:33] these children I want you to think of
[57:35] the consequences now that Bathsheba is
[57:39] going to have taken from her so
[57:42] Bathsheba was not asked did she want to
[57:45] come to the King's house
[57:46] she was not asked did she want to leave
[57:49] her home her husband she's now the
[57:53] stepmother of these children but David
[57:56] is looking at it through eyes of what
[58:00] compassion Mercy servitude to God he's
[58:04] looking at it through eyes of lust
[58:08] and selfishness
[58:10] he does not love Bathsheba he does not
[58:14] love Uriah or love the children that are
[58:18] going to be involved now seek of it all
[58:21] that the great amount of pain and
[58:25] anxiety and remember each one of these
[58:28] women brings something into the
[58:30] Kaleidoscope of the Gentile bride when
[58:33] we look at Tamar she brought something
[58:35] totally different than did Rahab and did
[58:38] ruse and yet we look at Bathsheba and I
[58:41] hope the Lord will help me to be able to
[58:43] bring it to you that Bathsheba was not
[58:46] just a one woman individual alone but
[58:50] she represented a spectrum of those that
[58:53] would make up the Gentile bride and she
[58:56] brings something into this genealogical
[58:59] equation that is totally different than
[59:02] the other four women so she's bringing
[59:06] something into this equation as a person
[59:09] with all types of hurt and all types of
[59:12] anxiety and all types of disappointments
[59:15] in life and thrown into a situation that
[59:19] she did not ask to be
[59:21] and yet also an individual that would
[59:25] not let her hurts dominate her life
[59:28] Bathsheba learned to love again
[59:31] Bathsheba learned to trust again that
[59:35] Sheba had to learn can you imagine now
[59:38] she's forced into this situation she
[59:42] becomes with the child of the king she
[59:45] did not ask for that she was taken from
[59:48] her husband forced into the king's bed
[59:51] she was forced from those step children
[59:54] that she had been taken care of right by
[59:58] whom a man of great Authority a man that
[1:00:03] had she resisted him he could have had
[1:00:05] her killed just like he did look at the
[1:00:08] power this man had writing my goodness
[1:00:11] uriah's own death warrant and he carried
[1:00:14] it back to the commander-in-chief
[1:00:17] look what Authority as I've said before
[1:00:20] God never intended for man to have such
[1:00:23] power in the first place so the
[1:00:25] relationship that Nason conveys to David
[1:00:28] look at the words that he uses which he
[1:00:30] bought and nourished it and it grew
[1:00:33] together with him and with his children
[1:00:35] it did deed of his own meat drink of his
[1:00:37] own cup laying his own bosom and was
[1:00:40] unto him as a daughter so every one of
[1:00:44] these attributes are attributes of deep
[1:00:47] kindness and affection so what's he
[1:00:49] doing is contrasting what David did
[1:00:52] versus what Uriah did so everything your
[1:00:56] eye did was love it was tenderness it
[1:00:59] was generaless it was affection and what
[1:01:02] did David do David come to feed his
[1:01:05] passion and his lust which was the
[1:01:08] stranger that come through and he did it
[1:01:11] out of selfishness out of his own lust
[1:01:14] praise the Lord which was the exact
[1:01:17] opposite sip of everything that Uriah
[1:01:20] had done
[1:01:21] notice in verse 4 and he said there came
[1:01:23] a traveler under the rich man and he
[1:01:26] spared to take of his own flock now here
[1:01:28] again he's identifying David as being
[1:01:31] this rich man which has many many flocks
[1:01:34] and he identifies the other guy as only
[1:01:37] having one little small you lamb he says
[1:01:40] of his own flock and of his own herd now
[1:01:43] to us you know this wouldn't mean very
[1:01:44] much but David spent many many years of
[1:01:47] his life as a Shepherd he's supposed to
[1:01:49] be doing the same thing now that he is
[1:01:52] King he is a Shepherd over God's people
[1:01:56] and he said to dress for the wayfaring
[1:01:58] man that was coming to him but took took
[1:02:03] the poor man's land and dressed it for
[1:02:06] the man that was to come now what is
[1:02:10] David fixing to do David is fixing to
[1:02:13] divide uriah's flock
[1:02:17] he's fixing to separate uriah's flock
[1:02:21] now they were happy they were just a
[1:02:23] simple family in Israel not a great
[1:02:26] renowned people who knows if we even
[1:02:28] know that much about Uriah had this
[1:02:30] story not come into view I personally
[1:02:33] believed it must have been the will of
[1:02:35] God in time for David and Bathsheba to
[1:02:39] be together how that would have come
[1:02:42] about I don't have a clue because there
[1:02:45] was a genetic pool that Bathsheba would
[1:02:48] have added to the lineage of David that
[1:02:51] was necessary for Solomon and for Nason
[1:02:55] and for the other two sons to come
[1:02:58] through it was through these four sons
[1:03:01] that the greatest children that David
[1:03:04] whatever father would come true notice a
[1:03:07] lot of the other Renegades and you see
[1:03:08] the mother church that they were born
[1:03:10] from and you see what a difference they
[1:03:12] were from Bathsheba now Bathsheba was
[1:03:15] not the type of woman the natural she
[1:03:17] was abused by all of this actually some
[1:03:19] of the Hebrew writers say David
[1:03:21] basically raped her it was not it was
[1:03:24] nothing on her own part she did not want
[1:03:26] to do it and yet a woman that was
[1:03:28] brought into the economy of God your
[1:03:31] first time to be beckoned into the
[1:03:33] Palace of the king it's against your
[1:03:35] will you're talked into doing something
[1:03:37] which is against the law of God against
[1:03:40] your husband against your own conscience
[1:03:42] and yet the king the greatest man in all
[1:03:45] of Israel is the one that forces you to
[1:03:47] do it how terrible
[1:03:50] now I guess my question to some of you
[1:03:52] today is this had you been living in the
[1:03:55] days of King David would you all had
[1:03:57] enough courage to stand for God and to
[1:04:01] say David is a sheep stealer and David
[1:04:04] is a murderer
[1:04:07] or would we have said well now you know
[1:04:13] um well now well now what well now
[1:04:21] some of you would have took up for me
[1:04:23] you know why because you take up for
[1:04:24] people now that do the same thing
[1:04:28] if it's one of your kids or one of your
[1:04:31] friends or somebody that you like shame
[1:04:33] on us for having respect a person
[1:04:36] the Bible calls it sin friends
[1:04:39] [Applause]
[1:04:41] now you imagine there were people in
[1:04:43] that day that heard about because the
[1:04:44] word got out that what David had done
[1:04:47] and some of them they were disappointed
[1:04:49] they were let down and no doubt people
[1:04:51] ain't changed one bit of what they were
[1:04:53] right then and some people took up for
[1:04:54] him said well you know you're right he's
[1:04:56] just an old dog and he ain't nothing but
[1:04:58] an old Gentile sorry outfit like King
[1:05:00] David he's loved to the Lord he's
[1:05:01] blessed of the Lord I may not totally go
[1:05:03] along with the way to do but I'll tell
[1:05:04] you what the blessing of God's on that
[1:05:06] man's life I ain't never heard nobody
[1:05:07] play that harp like he can play it I
[1:05:09] ain't heard nobody ever heard nobody
[1:05:10] sing like that man can sing have you
[1:05:12] ever heard anybody write a Psalm the way
[1:05:14] David Bob that man's a man of God he but
[1:05:16] God said he was wrong
[1:05:22] I want you to listen what kind of
[1:05:25] impression that Uriah made on your
[1:05:28] prophet
[1:05:29] brother REM says it this way when I get
[1:05:31] to Glory
[1:05:33] I want to walk up to Uriah
[1:05:36] and shake his hands and say God be
[1:05:40] praised
[1:05:41] for your testimony meant something to me
[1:05:44] in my Earthly Journey
[1:05:49] is that something a what Elijah is going
[1:05:53] to walk up and shake hands with Uriah
[1:05:56] the hittite and say your testimony meant
[1:06:00] something to me that's quite a man to me
[1:06:02] is it not to you
[1:06:04] now notice David then being the
[1:06:07] aggressor and as he moves into this spot
[1:06:10] as being the Predator I hate
[1:06:15] sexual predators
[1:06:18] I don't care if they're a preacher I
[1:06:21] don't care if they're a king I don't
[1:06:23] care if they claim to be a prophet
[1:06:28] I don't hate their soul but I hate that
[1:06:31] conniving low-down evil thing that gets
[1:06:34] on
[1:06:36] and let me tell your parents something
[1:06:37] in this age of social intercommunication
[1:06:41] that we have you better watch your
[1:06:44] children
[1:06:45] you better watch your daughters because
[1:06:47] we've got prayers oh my that love to
[1:06:50] pray on our teenage daughters and our
[1:06:53] teenage Sons well come on somebody say
[1:06:55] Amen
[1:06:56] some of you are too trusting in the
[1:06:58] first place and you know everything's
[1:07:00] all right my boy goes to church I don't
[1:07:02] mean one thing to God your boy ain't got
[1:07:05] the Holy Ghost he ain't no different
[1:07:07] than David was your girl ain't got the
[1:07:09] Holy Ghost ain't no different than
[1:07:11] anybody else was
[1:07:12] [Applause]
[1:07:16] now whenever we look at this scenario
[1:07:19] you know to be honest with you I don't
[1:07:21] like preaching this about David man he's
[1:07:23] one of my favorite Heroes I mean that
[1:07:25] you know this is a giant killer this is
[1:07:27] the bear killer this is the lion killer
[1:07:30] but I've got to add to his resume he's a
[1:07:32] Uriah killer
[1:07:38] can great people do stupid things
[1:07:44] great people can much less us
[1:07:46] ignoramuses
[1:07:48] hahaha
[1:07:49] and it ain't too astounding to me that
[1:07:52] crazy people can do crazy things but
[1:07:54] what have we done to a lot of these
[1:07:55] people we've bleached them out
[1:07:58] we bleached them out and made them where
[1:08:01] they were just almost faultless and
[1:08:03] without fault we need to take another
[1:08:05] read in our Bible
[1:08:07] I'll tell you every person that ever
[1:08:09] steps their feet down the streets ago
[1:08:11] you know how they're going to get there
[1:08:12] the grace of God
[1:08:17] oh my
[1:08:21] so David divides
[1:08:24] this flock
[1:08:26] this loving wonderful
[1:08:29] simple little home
[1:08:33] oh my goodness
[1:08:35] notice David the murderer second Samuel
[1:08:39] 11 14 and it came to pass in the morning
[1:08:42] that David wrote a letter to Joe I've
[1:08:44] been sent by the hand of Uriah and he
[1:08:46] wrote in the letter saying set you your
[1:08:47] ride in the Forefront of the hottest
[1:08:49] battle and retire you from him
[1:08:52] that he may be smitten and dying it came
[1:08:55] to pass what joab observed the city that
[1:08:57] he has signed Iran to a place where he
[1:08:59] knew the Valiant men were
[1:09:03] and the men of the city went out and
[1:09:05] fought with job and therefore some of
[1:09:08] the people of the Servants of David
[1:09:10] Uriah the hittite died also
[1:09:14] yet when he hears this in parabolic form
[1:09:17] he gets so mad
[1:09:21] why it was a nameless story
[1:09:30] so if you and I look at scenarios and we
[1:09:34] don't know who it is but we just show
[1:09:36] that ain't right go ahead of God I'll
[1:09:39] tell you one thing
[1:09:41] and then we attach a name and all of a
[1:09:44] sudden
[1:09:46] totally changed
[1:09:48] you need a closer walk with God
[1:09:56] remember friends the bride is going to
[1:10:00] be part of the judgment
[1:10:02] we are going to judge angels
[1:10:05] now let me just paint this soil
[1:10:08] say where I'm going with this God
[1:10:10] will not tolerate a sheep stealing King
[1:10:15] he will not tolerate a sheep stealing
[1:10:18] preacher
[1:10:19] neither will God tolerate a sheep
[1:10:22] stealing disease
[1:10:25] do you understand every child of God
[1:10:27] that deals with cancer with TB with
[1:10:31] pneumonia with all these diseases do you
[1:10:34] understand one day them demons that
[1:10:36] caused that are going to stand before us
[1:10:39] and they are going to give an account
[1:10:40] for trying to steal our life on this
[1:10:43] Earth
[1:10:46] I don't want to be no part of them
[1:10:49] demonic warfare to you because they're
[1:10:51] going to stand before God every devil
[1:10:53] that's tried to talk you out of your
[1:10:55] place every devil that's trying to talk
[1:10:57] you away from the word of God one day
[1:11:00] they're going to stand before you and
[1:11:02] they are going to be judged
[1:11:04] and condemned
[1:11:10] now watch David's response in verse 5
[1:11:12] and David's anger was greatly kindled
[1:11:15] against the man
[1:11:17] hmm
[1:11:18] because the prophet does such a
[1:11:20] wonderful job in setting this Force he
[1:11:22] still don't realize it's him
[1:11:27] so David passes judgment
[1:11:30] and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth
[1:11:34] the man that has done this thing
[1:11:37] shall surely die
[1:11:42] of all the blindness
[1:11:45] this is the worst kind
[1:11:47] because it makes us blind
[1:11:50] to ourselves
[1:11:53] how many has ever been there and done
[1:11:55] that
[1:11:56] and then all of a sudden the Lord by his
[1:11:58] Mercy opens your eyes and you say Lord
[1:12:00] have mercy
[1:12:01] it's so easy for us to see the blindness
[1:12:03] I wish brother so and so could I wish
[1:12:05] brother Paul could see how faulty I wish
[1:12:08] brother Aaron could say boy I'll tell
[1:12:10] you one thing I wish he could see how
[1:12:11] far glory to God I wish he could be like
[1:12:14] me I just wish everybody in the church
[1:12:17] could be like me well as the pastor I
[1:12:19] wish they ate
[1:12:21] I hope he ain't
[1:12:27] watched David render the Judgment in
[1:12:29] verse six he shall restore the lamb Thor
[1:12:33] full
[1:12:34] because he did this thing
[1:12:36] because he had no pity where did he get
[1:12:40] this now because of the way Nathan
[1:12:42] conveyed it the rich man was merciless
[1:12:46] no pity on this poor man and David
[1:12:49] picked it up
[1:12:51] Nathan said to David
[1:12:54] thou
[1:12:56] art the man
[1:13:01] you can imagine where he hears these
[1:13:03] words
[1:13:12] anybody ever done that besides me when
[1:13:14] that old heart goes
[1:13:17] and you feel the flush in your cheeks
[1:13:21] you can feel your blood pressure as it's
[1:13:23] going up
[1:13:24] and all of a sudden
[1:13:31] thou
[1:13:37] thus saith the Lord God of Israel
[1:13:41] I Anointed The King
[1:13:43] over Israel are not delivered thee
[1:13:46] out of the hand of Saul
[1:13:52] by coveting
[1:13:54] committing adultery
[1:13:57] bearing false witness
[1:13:59] and killing
[1:14:02] he trespasses for
[1:14:05] of the Ten Commandments
[1:14:09] yeah it Still Remains righteous enough
[1:14:12] to pronounce the judgment
[1:14:14] on some nameless character
[1:14:20] I could not imagine the anxiety and the
[1:14:22] trauma
[1:14:24] but this man now
[1:14:26] enters into him David sunk so low
[1:14:29] that he used the sword of the enemy
[1:14:33] to kill Uriah you see those who have
[1:14:36] left this message
[1:14:37] and it blessed the prophet and blast the
[1:14:40] bride
[1:14:41] that but then itself is condemnation
[1:14:43] enough
[1:14:45] but by using the sword of CNN
[1:14:50] ABC
[1:14:51] CBS
[1:14:53] Fox YouTube Google
[1:14:57] by using the sword of social media to
[1:15:02] try to kill this bride
[1:15:05] they add damnation
[1:15:07] to their judgment
[1:15:12] it would have been bad enough had they
[1:15:13] done it on their own
[1:15:15] but to bring it out
[1:15:18] as I saw one of them a few years ago
[1:15:21] that said in a local television station
[1:15:23] there in Louisville
[1:15:26] and was going to give a little essay
[1:15:30] of this message and how rotten it was in
[1:15:33] him formally setting at the Tabernacle
[1:15:36] and and he asked that his identity would
[1:15:39] be hid
[1:15:40] and asked that he would sit behind a
[1:15:43] screen and his face would not be seen
[1:15:47] because he feared for his life
[1:15:52] and I saw that I saw you coward
[1:15:55] you traitor you better fear for your
[1:15:59] soul
[1:16:00] not your life there ain't nobody in the
[1:16:03] mess is going to kill a person like that
[1:16:05] ain't nobody in the message going to get
[1:16:07] out for him and yet to do that to bring
[1:16:11] all of this on the prophet and his
[1:16:13] message come on saying so sit there and
[1:16:15] look at me like that
[1:16:17] don't you see what David done this is
[1:16:20] why God he just kept adding more and
[1:16:23] more to this sin
[1:16:26] notice in verse 9 wherefore thou Hast
[1:16:28] despised the Commandment of the Lord to
[1:16:31] do evil and thy sight now once again how
[1:16:33] God is going to lay the blame thou
[1:16:39] has killed Uriah the hittite with the
[1:16:42] sword
[1:16:42] and has taken his wife
[1:16:45] to be thy wife
[1:16:48] and assign him
[1:16:50] with the sword of the children
[1:16:53] family
[1:16:55] so after he forces himself on her
[1:17:00] then he takes her
[1:17:02] to be his wife he does not even allow
[1:17:05] her
[1:17:07] the 30 days of mourning
[1:17:10] why he's worried about his own height
[1:17:14] she's going to start showing
[1:17:25] so here David
[1:17:28] as he's sharing these words by now his
[1:17:30] soul is opened
[1:17:32] the sword has penetrated his soul
[1:17:35] let's just say
[1:17:46] Nathan can see
[1:17:48] he's so distraught
[1:17:53] his heart rate
[1:17:54] his blood pressure is affecting him
[1:17:56] physically
[1:17:58] Nathan looks at him and says
[1:18:00] Thou shalt not
[1:18:03] die
[1:18:08] that soon
[1:18:10] the mercy of God turns
[1:18:13] David's judgment
[1:18:16] and God forgives him
[1:18:19] and releases him from his own penalty of
[1:18:25] death
[1:18:27] Amazing Grace
[1:18:29] how sweet is him
[1:18:35] God's grace could forgive him
[1:18:39] but God's government
[1:18:42] demands
[1:18:46] you see this is something I'm not sure a
[1:18:49] lot of message folks understand
[1:18:52] that whenever they do wrong
[1:18:54] that God can forgive him yes he will and
[1:18:58] he wants to
[1:18:59] but you see when we do wrong we are
[1:19:02] sowing seeds
[1:19:04] and our repentance does not go out there
[1:19:07] and dig up all them seeds out of the
[1:19:10] ground but it simply pardons us and we
[1:19:13] won't have to answer on the other side
[1:19:16] of the veil for them but we planted that
[1:19:19] crop
[1:19:20] and the crop will come up
[1:19:24] that's God's government now God's mercy
[1:19:28] can forgive him and God right there the
[1:19:30] display of Grace come on the scene and
[1:19:32] he said Thou shalt not die
[1:19:35] but the sword will never leave
[1:19:39] your house
[1:19:43] so God accepted the sentence
[1:19:47] of the four-fold punishment
[1:19:51] now watch this I put this down so and
[1:19:53] skip over it
[1:19:54] so the baby died
[1:19:58] Absalom killed amnon
[1:20:02] joab killed Absalom
[1:20:06] I donate you was killed by Ben and I
[1:20:12] so David reaped fourfold
[1:20:17] and that's just
[1:20:20] Tamar was forced by her half-brother
[1:20:25] Absalom tries to take to Kingdom
[1:20:29] goes into David's concubines
[1:20:32] out on the roof
[1:20:34] in public View
[1:20:36] of everybody
[1:20:39] Tamar's life was ruined
[1:20:42] David sowed lust
[1:20:45] he ripped lust
[1:20:47] David sowed murder
[1:20:50] he reaped murder
[1:20:55] notice in verse 10 now therefore the
[1:20:57] sword shall never depart from thine
[1:20:59] house because thou Hast despised me and
[1:21:03] has taken the wife of Uriah the hittype
[1:21:06] to be thy one now my little friend
[1:21:08] David's adultery was a sin of passion
[1:21:12] and we know if you know the law you know
[1:21:14] even today that many times defense
[1:21:17] attorneys will try to defend a client
[1:21:21] that has done things and that even the
[1:21:23] judges and the you know all the law
[1:21:25] understand that there is Crimes of
[1:21:29] Passion a rage a fit of anger and
[1:21:33] someone loses their temper and they kill
[1:21:35] someone and a defense attorney will try
[1:21:37] to plead the case that way
[1:21:40] and even God in his love understood that
[1:21:44] David's adultery was a crime a passion
[1:21:49] but his murder of Uriah
[1:21:52] was premeditated murder
[1:22:01] Lord God
[1:22:04] oh Jesus
[1:22:07] notice verse 11 thus saith the Lord
[1:22:09] behold I will raise up evil against thee
[1:22:13] notice God does not say against thee
[1:22:16] and Bathsheba
[1:22:19] I will take thy wives die notice all of
[1:22:22] this is personally directed now to King
[1:22:25] David
[1:22:26] I will take thy wives from before thine
[1:22:28] eyes and give them unto Thy Neighbor
[1:22:31] Absalom lived in a house right next door
[1:22:35] to David
[1:22:36] he shall lie with thy wives and the
[1:22:39] sight of this son
[1:22:42] for thou didst it in secretly but I will
[1:22:45] do this thing before all Israel and
[1:22:47] before the son and David said unto
[1:22:49] Nathan I notice the difference between
[1:22:52] David and Adam
[1:22:55] I just read to you just a few moments
[1:22:57] ago what Adam said the woman that thou
[1:22:59] gave us to me this is why God
[1:23:02] conspire David the death penalty brother
[1:23:06] sister when you do wrong the thing is do
[1:23:08] you know how to repent and there's one
[1:23:11] thing about David you have to give him
[1:23:13] credit the man knew how to repent
[1:23:16] Saul did not know how he blamed this one
[1:23:19] he blamed that but he blames somebody
[1:23:20] else true repentance is a great gift
[1:23:23] from God don't blame your wife don't
[1:23:26] blame the pastor don't blame the
[1:23:28] children don't blame the church assume
[1:23:31] you're on and ask God to forgive you
[1:23:35] repentance and so moves the heart of God
[1:23:41] oh my
[1:23:43] Lord God
[1:23:45] David said unto Nathan ah
[1:23:48] not her what if she hadn't been out
[1:23:51] there taking the mcval I would have
[1:23:53] never said it ain't my fault don't blame
[1:23:55] me oh I love the way he grabs a whole to
[1:23:58] the heart of God and that in that moment
[1:24:02] the heart of God was moved against a
[1:24:06] sheep stealing murdering King
[1:24:10] praise the Lord
[1:24:13] hmm
[1:24:15] I have sinned against the Lord
[1:24:19] Nathan said unto David the Lord also you
[1:24:23] imagine that quick
[1:24:27] the Lord also has put away
[1:24:30] thy sin
[1:24:33] Thou shalt not die
[1:24:36] how be it because by this deed thou has
[1:24:39] given great occasion to the enemies of
[1:24:42] the Lord to blaspheme
[1:24:47] the child also that is born unto thee
[1:24:50] shall surely die
[1:24:51] Nathan departed into his house and the
[1:24:55] Lord struck the child that uriah's wife
[1:25:01] notice how God is still calling her
[1:25:04] uriah's wife
[1:25:06] but Uriah is dead
[1:25:10] and David is now married to her
[1:25:12] but God's still calling her
[1:25:15] uriah's wife
[1:25:18] now this is a bad scenario
[1:25:21] whether it's a wife or a car or a house
[1:25:24] or spiritual sheep God's calling them
[1:25:27] belonging to another man and you've got
[1:25:30] them
[1:25:33] uh-huh come on now
[1:25:36] notice in verse 18 that it came to pass
[1:25:39] on the seventh day
[1:25:42] that the child died
[1:25:47] as I said earlier I believe
[1:25:50] from the genetic makeup and the DNA that
[1:25:54] bathsheeta Bathsheba would have
[1:25:56] attributed into mixing with David
[1:26:00] God somehow in his plan must have had it
[1:26:04] that they would be together with your
[1:26:06] eye fulfill this life and David would
[1:26:09] have met her in a uh the right kind of
[1:26:12] way and they would have been joined
[1:26:13] together maybe that was the will of God
[1:26:16] and you know Satan is so cunning
[1:26:20] that if he can get a little bit of
[1:26:23] insight about the program of God and let
[1:26:26] me just be honest with you and say I
[1:26:28] don't know how much Satan can always see
[1:26:30] ahead of time but apparently he can see
[1:26:33] some things ahead of time
[1:26:35] brother Brown tells us about Brother
[1:26:37] Richard Blair from Arkansas and he said
[1:26:41] that brother Blair the devil tried to
[1:26:43] make brother Blair doubt brother Branham
[1:26:46] and question him
[1:26:48] now there was a scenario happened that
[1:26:50] brother Brown got very very sick at the
[1:26:52] point of death and sister Blair call
[1:26:55] Brother Branham on the phone and brother
[1:26:56] Brandon but prayed for him and the Lord
[1:26:58] spared his life and brother Branham
[1:27:00] relates this scenario on tape and you
[1:27:02] can hear it and he said that the devil
[1:27:05] knew that brother Blair was going to
[1:27:07] need him now how did the devil know that
[1:27:10] I don't know exactly but it sounds like
[1:27:13] there are some things that Satan can be
[1:27:15] able to see in the making and he will
[1:27:18] try to mess it up as if though it will
[1:27:22] foil the whole program of God does that
[1:27:24] make sense to you so then when you look
[1:27:27] at this it would have seemed as if
[1:27:29] though there's no way God would have
[1:27:31] ever blessed any Union between David and
[1:27:36] Bathsheba why because Satan messed up
[1:27:40] the time
[1:27:41] it was the right people
[1:27:44] but the wrong time
[1:27:46] in the wrong place
[1:27:49] which is just as much out of the will of
[1:27:51] God as if it's the wrong people now
[1:27:53] watch this the prophet and believer's
[1:27:55] position in Christ he said the main
[1:27:57] thing is if we can find where God's word
[1:27:59] belongs in our life God sets times and
[1:28:04] God sets limits then it works all to
[1:28:08] that time now notice he said God set
[1:28:11] time and God sets limits then it all
[1:28:15] works to that time so it's not just the
[1:28:18] will of God Alone that we're looking for
[1:28:20] but we're looking at the right time and
[1:28:22] he said people tried to do it within
[1:28:24] themselves and they try to make God's
[1:28:27] word fit in their program but you've got
[1:28:30] it vice versa you've got to fit in God's
[1:28:33] program and we find that that's true now
[1:28:35] Moses when he was there knowing that God
[1:28:37] had made him a promise he was going to
[1:28:40] deliver the children of Israel Moses
[1:28:43] knowing he was called for that purpose
[1:28:45] now when you have a call from God that
[1:28:48] doesn't altogether a name that you just
[1:28:50] jump right out and you're doing the will
[1:28:54] of God now listen carefully you have to
[1:28:57] find the will of God and the time of God
[1:29:01] to do it I may believe Moses is called
[1:29:04] to be the liver
[1:29:05] he was called to be the deliverer that
[1:29:08] God had ordained for send him down there
[1:29:10] but Moses jumps ahead of the program of
[1:29:12] God now remember God told them I told
[1:29:14] Abraham that they would go down and
[1:29:16] sojourn into a land and be a stranger
[1:29:18] for 400 years how many knows how many
[1:29:21] years they stayed
[1:29:22] 430.
[1:29:26] God said 400.
[1:29:28] well where did the 30 years come
[1:29:31] will it come by Moses and also the
[1:29:34] people
[1:29:35] Moses missed the time of God
[1:29:39] that means every missed the time of God
[1:29:40] well I sure have
[1:29:42] now people think because they're called
[1:29:44] to do this or that the other whatever it
[1:29:45] is as soon as they feel the call and
[1:29:48] feel God calling them to do something
[1:29:50] they feel that's the time to jump right
[1:29:52] out and go after it and if you're not
[1:29:54] careful you'll get in more trouble than
[1:29:56] the man who don't even move
[1:29:58] because you may have found the will of
[1:30:00] God for you as an individual but you
[1:30:02] missed the timeline
[1:30:04] now notice he said Moses thought the
[1:30:07] children of Israel will understand I
[1:30:09] said you have to find the will of God
[1:30:11] and the time of God to do it and Moses
[1:30:13] thought well the children of Israel will
[1:30:15] understand now that I'm to be the
[1:30:17] deliverer so he starts out and he killed
[1:30:19] him that in other there's no way in the
[1:30:21] world that you and I believe that God
[1:30:23] was the one who called Moses to kill the
[1:30:25] Egyptian so Moses starts out on his
[1:30:28] resume a lot like David so he's a
[1:30:30] murderer now did God want that on Moses
[1:30:33] resume there ain't no way how did that
[1:30:36] come about he got out of the will of God
[1:30:37] he missed the time how long was it I
[1:30:40] don't have a clue but there must have
[1:30:42] been an element of time and Satan messed
[1:30:45] him up on the time frame and caused all
[1:30:48] of this mess and chaos
[1:30:51] cause the children of God to suffer for
[1:30:53] 30 more years than necessary well I wish
[1:30:56] somebody preached with me this morning
[1:30:58] now notice so he starts out to do it he
[1:31:00] killed a man and he found out the
[1:31:02] children of Israel did not understand
[1:31:04] yet Moses thought they would understand
[1:31:07] what was missing in this whole scenario
[1:31:10] the time of God the time of God Moses
[1:31:15] was the right man and the church said
[1:31:17] he was the right man for the hour but
[1:31:20] the hour had not yet synchronized quite
[1:31:23] where it was right and it enters into a
[1:31:26] complete mess
[1:31:28] then Moses lost all hopes can you
[1:31:32] imagine Moses lost all hopes the power
[1:31:37] that he had thinking that the freedom
[1:31:39] wasn't for the children of Israel now
[1:31:42] Moses gets all discouraged and gets all
[1:31:44] down on the mouth as we'd say and he
[1:31:47] lost all hope that it was even for the
[1:31:51] children of Israel what God even going
[1:31:52] to do it well God must not love him God
[1:31:55] don't care for him and no doubt the
[1:31:56] devil was turning it around and blaming
[1:31:58] God in Moses mind when it wasn't God's
[1:32:00] fault at all it was Moses fault
[1:32:06] he lost all thoughts of Freedom so God
[1:32:09] met him one day in a burning bush and
[1:32:12] then when God season came along just
[1:32:15] exactly then he revealed his plans to
[1:32:17] Moses now the reason that Moses had
[1:32:20] forgot about Freedom God's promised that
[1:32:22] he would free them but God hadn't forgot
[1:32:24] about it Moses tried in himself and
[1:32:29] failed
[1:32:31] so what happened here with David David
[1:32:33] got in himself and committed adultery
[1:32:38] so David takes Bathsheba to himself not
[1:32:41] in love but in lust
[1:32:45] I firmly believe that David and
[1:32:47] Bathsheba fell in love later
[1:32:51] but God never intended for them to be
[1:32:54] joined together
[1:32:56] in the birthing Canal of lust
[1:33:01] oh my
[1:33:03] Moses tried it himself and failed that's
[1:33:05] what the church has done many times
[1:33:07] we've tried in ourselves to do things
[1:33:10] and we failed to find God's element of
[1:33:14] time
[1:33:16] God has times for a season he has
[1:33:19] seasons for his word he has times in the
[1:33:22] scripture where it said in the presence
[1:33:24] of the Lord was there to heal the sick
[1:33:26] you talking about mind-blowing I want
[1:33:28] you to listen to this
[1:33:29] there was times when the Lord was there
[1:33:31] to heal the sick that's where when Jesus
[1:33:34] was ministering too
[1:33:37] you imagine when the Lord Jesus was here
[1:33:39] ministering to Jesus had to operate in
[1:33:43] the season the Bible says in certain
[1:33:46] places Jesus went in and healed them all
[1:33:48] and then he went into another place and
[1:33:50] he couldn't do any Mighty Miracles
[1:33:52] because of their unbelief and the angel
[1:33:55] would trouble the water when when the
[1:33:57] people were ready at the Lord God's
[1:33:59] pleasure in his season
[1:34:01] maybe that other times the presence of
[1:34:04] the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick
[1:34:08] wow the presence of the Lord wasn't
[1:34:11] there to heal the sin I'll tell you a
[1:34:14] friend I love to sing I love to shout I
[1:34:16] love to have prayer lines I love all
[1:34:18] that but if we're not careful we're
[1:34:20] creating another repeat to where we feel
[1:34:23] like if we don't have a prayer line God
[1:34:25] can't move we feel like every special
[1:34:28] meeting's got to have a prayer line or
[1:34:29] God don't move come on don't get quiet
[1:34:31] on me if we're not careful we're going
[1:34:33] right back around the mountain that we
[1:34:35] come away from years and years ago our
[1:34:38] God is not going to be told what to do
[1:34:40] he's not going to be told how to move
[1:34:42] God wants us to follow him not him
[1:34:46] follow us
[1:34:49] [Applause]
[1:34:51] we find out that God works everything
[1:34:54] seasonally
[1:34:56] seasonally and now when Moses when he
[1:35:00] failed to find what he failed to find
[1:35:03] was the time limit of God and many times
[1:35:06] we try to do the program ourselves and
[1:35:09] fail to direct what was in the burning
[1:35:11] bush the direct revelation of the will
[1:35:14] and the time of God
[1:35:19] so now here stands David indicted
[1:35:23] by God's
[1:35:27] David's sin
[1:35:29] was so rotten so vile
[1:35:32] David could be restored to Fellowship
[1:35:36] but the Judgment must be lived out
[1:35:39] now let me let us look at Bathsheba for
[1:35:42] a few moments can we
[1:35:45] try if you can
[1:35:47] to be able to let her be the sister
[1:35:51] that she really is
[1:35:54] she is the one
[1:35:56] that they say Proverbs 31
[1:36:01] was written about
[1:36:03] who can find
[1:36:05] the virtuous
[1:36:09] ah
[1:36:10] so if your mother was a harlot
[1:36:13] would you write that about her
[1:36:16] if your mother was a prostitute
[1:36:19] would you write that she was a model of
[1:36:23] a virtuous woman but let's look at her
[1:36:25] realistically
[1:36:27] now Bathsheba was a victim
[1:36:31] who suffered from many life-changing
[1:36:35] situations after that invitation to the
[1:36:39] Palace
[1:36:40] she was separated from her husband as
[1:36:43] being a military wife
[1:36:47] so she's already dealing with that
[1:36:50] whenever David beckons her to the Palace
[1:36:53] so she's already suffering with
[1:36:55] loneliness and trying to raise the
[1:36:57] children
[1:36:58] she then deals with being forced upon by
[1:37:02] the king
[1:37:03] the king taken advantage of her
[1:37:08] then she deals with grieving over a
[1:37:13] murdered spouse
[1:37:16] then she deals with dealing with being
[1:37:20] pregnant with the king's baby
[1:37:23] and being pregnant
[1:37:25] as a widow
[1:37:29] I wonder why we ain't thought of these
[1:37:30] things before
[1:37:32] but we've bleached out King David and
[1:37:35] made him the Great Mighty conqueror and
[1:37:38] then just put this rotten sorry woman
[1:37:40] back there in the Hog Pen where she
[1:37:42] belongs I think we need to move her from
[1:37:43] the Hog Pen
[1:37:49] now if this wasn't bad enough now she is
[1:37:53] called into the king
[1:37:55] and the King takes her to be his wife
[1:37:58] and by the way the Bible does not tell
[1:38:00] us that she even wanted to be
[1:38:03] and
[1:38:04] oh my goodness
[1:38:07] so she makes this transition how can you
[1:38:10] imagine your your marriage to this man
[1:38:12] one day and then a week from now this
[1:38:15] man here marriage and you're married to
[1:38:16] him
[1:38:17] now what happened to those children
[1:38:21] those step children
[1:38:23] your eye was dead she is now brought out
[1:38:27] of that house into the Palace of the
[1:38:29] king what happens to those children do
[1:38:32] you honestly think David even cared
[1:38:36] the epitome of selfishness
[1:38:40] how rotten
[1:38:42] how devastating
[1:38:44] selfishness is
[1:38:48] come on now Saints
[1:38:50] can we dare to look at David as he was
[1:38:53] some of you can some of you can
[1:38:56] well I'm going to be real Brave this
[1:38:58] morning and I'm going to look at him the
[1:39:00] way he was
[1:39:01] because I want to see the grace of God
[1:39:03] the way I've never seen it in my life
[1:39:06] hmm
[1:39:08] so she now becomes his fourth wife
[1:39:13] she loses this baby
[1:39:15] oh my
[1:39:18] God not only that now she starts a new
[1:39:20] future
[1:39:21] she is King David's wife
[1:39:25] her children I put these things down let
[1:39:27] me just read them off to you
[1:39:29] her future children will be raised
[1:39:32] within a context of sexual misconduct
[1:39:37] manipulation
[1:39:38] competition
[1:39:40] cover-up
[1:39:42] and violence
[1:39:44] welcome to the family
[1:39:47] of King David
[1:39:52] let me read them to you again sexual
[1:39:55] misconda manipulation competition
[1:39:58] cover-up and violence now can you
[1:40:01] imagine
[1:40:02] you got four wives they've all got
[1:40:05] youngins
[1:40:06] and every one of them thinks hers is you
[1:40:08] know it's the very best this needs to be
[1:40:10] the king this needs to be in charge of
[1:40:12] the music this needs to be the service
[1:40:14] leader this one year needs to be the
[1:40:16] Deacon that's why folks want to run a
[1:40:17] church you know this is the way it ought
[1:40:19] to be and this is an honor to that can
[1:40:20] you imagine Four Women and they're all
[1:40:23] telling you that their son is the
[1:40:24] greatest he's the brightest he is the
[1:40:27] most brilliant and we can see as they
[1:40:29] grow older that they go Divine for the
[1:40:32] competition of who's going to be king
[1:40:33] and you remember the story of adonija of
[1:40:35] course before David is now old and
[1:40:38] before David ever declares who the heir
[1:40:40] is after Niger begins to pull men away
[1:40:42] and he begins to start in saying that he
[1:40:45] is the king the Revolt has started so
[1:40:48] her her little life that she had back
[1:40:51] there by herself was her and her little
[1:40:54] your husband that she loves so much and
[1:40:56] he loved her look what woman would not
[1:40:58] want that kind of a husband
[1:41:01] when you read all your life the way he
[1:41:04] loved this woman and the way he treated
[1:41:06] her putting her up on a pedestal as it
[1:41:09] was he nourished her he loved her he
[1:41:12] cared for her so much what woman should
[1:41:14] have to be out of her mind to not love
[1:41:16] such a man there's no way that this
[1:41:19] woman broke off all that love all that
[1:41:22] feelings all that emotion that she had
[1:41:25] for this husband which was her hero and
[1:41:28] now she's supposed to fall in love with
[1:41:30] a man who forced himself on her
[1:41:33] but we just read through the Bible
[1:41:36] sometimes and we omit so much pain we
[1:41:39] read to the Bible and admit so much
[1:41:41] suffering oh I'm telling you friend
[1:41:43] nobody is so tried as the bride of
[1:41:46] Christ there's so much suffering there's
[1:41:49] so much anxiety there's so much pain
[1:41:51] that's hidden between the verses of
[1:41:54] these Bible characters and we read right
[1:41:57] over the top of them
[1:42:01] because we all prefer the slang stories
[1:42:06] oh
[1:42:07] we prefer the sword cutting the head off
[1:42:11] and the glory blood and all that sort of
[1:42:14] thing
[1:42:15] what about the people setting back
[1:42:17] crying
[1:42:18] because they're called in situations
[1:42:20] they never asked for
[1:42:23] some of you sitting right here today are
[1:42:25] still dealing with trauma and things in
[1:42:28] your life that happen to you
[1:42:30] when you were children
[1:42:33] things that you have dealt with
[1:42:35] things that people did to you
[1:42:39] I know
[1:42:45] my what are we gonna do
[1:42:47] it Bathsheba is such an example
[1:42:52] of one that dealt with so much pain so
[1:42:55] much trauma so much anxiety so much that
[1:42:58] was forced upon her by others not by her
[1:43:02] own choice
[1:43:05] to let it move huh
[1:43:07] in a negative way
[1:43:10] I hope you understand this
[1:43:13] her husband had the reputation of being
[1:43:16] a man
[1:43:17] after God's Own Heart
[1:43:20] that's what I've been studying about her
[1:43:22] for the last several weeks
[1:43:24] I just kind of renamed her for my own
[1:43:27] sake this morning
[1:43:28] and called her
[1:43:30] a woman
[1:43:31] after God's
[1:43:37] read about her in Proverbs 31 and see
[1:43:40] what a woman she became
[1:43:43] read what a woman she was in so much
[1:43:46] someone King Solomon come in and he sat
[1:43:49] down on his throne and his mother come
[1:43:51] into the court and she said she had a
[1:43:54] petition to lay before him and the king
[1:43:56] of Israel gets up off of his throne and
[1:44:00] bows
[1:44:02] Hazel basins to his mother
[1:44:07] causes for a throne to be made for his
[1:44:11] mother and sets her at his own right
[1:44:19] a woman who refused to let her negative
[1:44:23] circumstances make her negative all her
[1:44:26] life but allowed God to mold in her
[1:44:30] about chapter Bible chapter in the Bible
[1:44:33] rather that many of you sisters have
[1:44:35] read and desire to be your model is from
[1:44:37] there that I took my text when I preach
[1:44:39] sister Karen pure's funeral and oh my
[1:44:42] the women the daughters of God when many
[1:44:45] of you ever sought that that was
[1:44:48] Bathsheba
[1:44:56] if I was you
[1:44:58] I wouldn't let Satan ride off your life
[1:45:03] I wouldn't let your parents write it
[1:45:07] up know your friends
[1:45:09] and last and most important of all
[1:45:12] I wouldn't let you write it off
[1:45:19] but if you knew my track record so you
[1:45:21] want to compare it to David's today
[1:45:28] and you want to stand and say I've done
[1:45:30] this bad or worse
[1:45:36] and yet the Lord God
[1:45:39] chose when he come to the Earth
[1:45:42] to come down through that and be called
[1:45:44] the son
[1:45:45] of David
[1:45:47] remember also the New Testament son of
[1:45:49] David have mercy on me son of David
[1:45:52] Henry he's like Tara don't call me an
[1:45:53] old daughter son don't call me the
[1:45:57] even in the Millennium when he sat on
[1:45:59] the throne he will be called the son of
[1:46:02] David
[1:46:03] Amazing Grace
[1:46:05] how sweet to sound
[1:46:09] Hallelujah so the other women of David
[1:46:12] now
[1:46:13] one that was so hurt one that had so
[1:46:17] many scars so many issues
[1:46:21] she refused
[1:46:22] to let those things shape her
[1:46:25] and Stitch he became a woman
[1:46:28] after God's Own Heart
[1:46:32] so notable
[1:46:34] that Solomon mentions his mother over
[1:46:37] and over and over again
[1:46:40] through the Book of Proverbs
[1:46:43] forget not the instruction of thy mother
[1:46:45] of the instruction of thy father and the
[1:46:48] wisdom and the teaching of thy mother
[1:46:50] how could you do that if your mother was
[1:46:53] a
[1:46:54] a prostitute
[1:47:00] so the world let him look down at us let
[1:47:02] him make fun but one day when they
[1:47:05] walked Before the Throne of the Lord God
[1:47:07] they will see surrounding that throne
[1:47:10] is the makeup
[1:47:12] of a roof
[1:47:14] a Rahab
[1:47:16] ath Sheba
[1:47:18] a Tamar
[1:47:20] and the fifth
[1:47:22] for Mary
[1:47:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:29] let's Stand Together
[1:47:37] I can imagine that Bathsheba like many
[1:47:40] of us
[1:47:43] myself having dealt with many
[1:47:46] people who've dealt with abuse whether
[1:47:49] it's
[1:47:50] sexual abuse or
[1:47:52] psychological abuse verbal abuse there's
[1:47:54] many types of abuse
[1:47:57] many times the innocent person is the
[1:47:59] one
[1:48:00] who feels so guilty
[1:48:03] though they were the one preyed upon
[1:48:06] huh
[1:48:08] many times them sorry outfits that Prey
[1:48:11] Upon them
[1:48:12] will scare them you better not do this
[1:48:15] you better not tell nobody you better
[1:48:16] not this that the other
[1:48:18] and somehow they feel themself
[1:48:21] that it's their fault
[1:48:25] I wonder
[1:48:27] if Bathsheba put it over her mind over
[1:48:29] and over again oh
[1:48:32] if I hadn't have taken that Mikvah
[1:48:36] that ceremonial basket maybe if I'd have
[1:48:38] done it earlier maybe if I'd have done
[1:48:39] it later
[1:48:40] maybe if I'd had done it the day before
[1:48:42] the day after
[1:48:44] that's generally the mentality of a
[1:48:47] victim
[1:48:48] that they look at themselves what did I
[1:48:50] do which works on what their self-esteem
[1:48:55] and they look at themself
[1:48:58] it's unworthy
[1:49:00] and worthy of favor Unworthy of Grace
[1:49:03] Unworthy of Mercy
[1:49:05] so to get around good people what they
[1:49:07] call good people people that wasn't like
[1:49:10] they were and they said well I'm not
[1:49:12] good I'm not as good as them I'm not as
[1:49:14] good as them people I'll never be
[1:49:16] nothing I'll never amount to anything
[1:49:17] I'm worried that it'll be treated bad
[1:49:19] I'm no you're not
[1:49:23] the Lord Jesus loves you so much
[1:49:29] having been a victim myself
[1:49:32] of abuse
[1:49:34] abuse
[1:49:36] I can tell you some pain
[1:49:39] I can tell you some anxiety
[1:49:42] having been a victim
[1:49:44] of being abused by preachers
[1:49:46] lied on used made fun of
[1:49:51] I went and preached meetings for
[1:49:53] preachers
[1:49:54] and them ask me
[1:49:56] for the offering
[1:50:01] so what'd you do I give it to him of
[1:50:03] course
[1:50:06] and went and preached other meetings and
[1:50:07] when I get home the preacher would write
[1:50:09] me a letter
[1:50:11] and say my wife said I'm worth about a
[1:50:13] thousand dollars a month so could you
[1:50:15] care to send me part of the offer
[1:50:19] preachers
[1:50:21] um
[1:50:23] so when people come to me with their
[1:50:24] little big flimsy excuse they got hurt
[1:50:26] by one and they don't want to believe in
[1:50:28] Preachers no more
[1:50:30] I'm sorry it takes a little bit more
[1:50:32] than that to be able to
[1:50:33] excuse you for me because believe me
[1:50:35] I've been lied to
[1:50:37] I've been treated I've been used abused
[1:50:41] but I still believe God's gotten in
[1:50:45] that are sincere that love him that love
[1:50:47] his people
[1:50:51] right
[1:50:52] don't you
[1:50:53] that's right
[1:50:56] I refuse
[1:50:59] mother don't you still dealing with some
[1:51:00] of my stuff ah
[1:51:02] I sure do
[1:51:05] I'll probably have to deal with it until
[1:51:07] one day The Sweep comes over me
[1:51:11] yeah
[1:51:12] but I refuse
[1:51:14] to allow it to dominate me
[1:51:18] do I fight the thing that the only
[1:51:20] reason brother Donnie that people call
[1:51:22] you and contact is you because they want
[1:51:24] money
[1:51:28] I get it all the time sometimes daily we
[1:51:31] need help with this we need ten thousand
[1:51:32] dollars we need twenty thousand dollars
[1:51:34] we need this we need a new car we need a
[1:51:36] new microphone we need a new PA system
[1:51:37] and I think if I didn't help people with
[1:51:39] anybody even know my name would they
[1:51:41] even care a thing about me
[1:51:44] sure that's stuff we have to deal with
[1:51:46] I'm just being honest with you who's
[1:51:48] next
[1:51:54] but I refuse to let that dominate me
[1:51:58] so does that stop you from giving huh
[1:52:01] what do you think
[1:52:03] no
[1:52:05] well I've been hurt I can't trust
[1:52:07] somebody I can't so you're going to let
[1:52:08] that dominate you are you
[1:52:11] if you ever get to heaven
[1:52:14] it'll be because you were led by men
[1:52:17] you were encouraged by men you were
[1:52:19] helped by men
[1:52:21] you were preached to a New Birth by men
[1:52:24] you were preached to the baptism of the
[1:52:26] Holy Ghost by men you were preached into
[1:52:28] rapturing Faith by men you reached a
[1:52:31] body Changed by men
[1:52:33] you say why because that's God's way
[1:52:38] that's God's way
[1:52:40] Hallelujah
[1:52:42] [Applause]
[1:52:48] sebastshiba
[1:52:51] you can take your hurts you're paying
[1:52:53] your anxiety go way back in a little
[1:52:55] room
[1:52:58] have nothing to do with nobody have no
[1:53:00] confidence in nobody and just stay home
[1:53:02] the rest of your life and play tapes
[1:53:05] I'll never be hurt by a preacher can
[1:53:07] I'll never be her I'm just going to stay
[1:53:09] home and play tapes the rest of my life
[1:53:11] and the person that's being hurt the
[1:53:13] worst by that is you
[1:53:19] or you can venture out
[1:53:21] and love again
[1:53:24] Trust
[1:53:27] Carolyn I said at a funeral a few years
[1:53:29] ago of my aunt in Kentucky
[1:53:33] out of the corner of my eye I saw a man
[1:53:36] coming up
[1:53:37] on a walker
[1:53:40] as I looked at the side of his face I
[1:53:42] realized
[1:53:44] who it was
[1:53:47] the preacher
[1:53:49] that molested me
[1:53:54] cold sweat popped out on my face
[1:53:58] I felt my face Flushing
[1:54:01] Carol could feel it she's sitting right
[1:54:03] by me she grabbed me by the hand you
[1:54:04] okay
[1:54:12] humanly
[1:54:14] I wanted to grab up walk up to that man
[1:54:17] and grab that Walker and beat him over
[1:54:19] the head with that time
[1:54:24] why
[1:54:26] still the scars
[1:54:30] pain
[1:54:34] but Jesus inside of me
[1:54:36] raised up
[1:54:41] and I felt the sweat stop
[1:54:44] and I felt the color of my skin changing
[1:54:46] my ears were burning and they got cooled
[1:54:48] off
[1:54:50] and Brother David I looked at him
[1:54:52] and what I felt
[1:54:56] sorry for him
[1:55:00] and it wasn't a Fitting Place or I would
[1:55:03] have danced
[1:55:05] most of the people there knew me anyway
[1:55:06] that had already been eyeing me you know
[1:55:10] I can't I just can't describe to you how
[1:55:13] I felt
[1:55:14] because but Joel I realized the Lord
[1:55:17] Jesus
[1:55:18] had helped me
[1:55:21] I was glad I was able to see that man
[1:55:23] because they've been years and years
[1:55:24] since I'd seen him
[1:55:26] I wasn't quite sure how I would react
[1:55:30] but I was so happy
[1:55:32] the way the King of Kings reacted him
[1:55:36] no doubt I would have been ashamed of
[1:55:38] the way Otto acted
[1:55:40] but I was not ashamed of the way
[1:55:42] my king acted
[1:55:46] what about it today friends
[1:55:49] we come in our lives to make up the
[1:55:51] Kaleidoscope for the making of the
[1:55:53] Gentile bride some of you will like
[1:55:55] rehab some of you maybe like Tamar
[1:55:58] there may be a few of you that's like
[1:56:00] Mary
[1:56:01] they say oh I'd personally like to be
[1:56:03] able to shake your hand after church
[1:56:05] since since apparently I don't know any
[1:56:06] of you all that make up our church
[1:56:11] but I wonder how many of us
[1:56:13] will be like Bathsheba
[1:56:16] so hurt
[1:56:17] so scarred
[1:56:19] so wounded
[1:56:21] but we refuse to let our past dictate to
[1:56:25] us our future
[1:56:32] you remember when the prophet went
[1:56:33] overseas and he missed God
[1:56:35] and listen to preachers instead of
[1:56:37] listening to the Lord and he picked up
[1:56:39] the amoeba
[1:56:40] and he come back and he thought he was
[1:56:42] going to die
[1:56:43] he got up early one morning
[1:56:45] run a bathtub full of water running a
[1:56:48] fever and going to all these different
[1:56:49] signs of the amoeba
[1:56:52] and he saw a vision appeared before him
[1:56:55] and a Heavenly being took pieces of
[1:56:58] paper like sheets of paper
[1:57:00] in his hand
[1:57:03] and he threw those pieces of paper
[1:57:06] up toward the sky
[1:57:08] and it made a pass
[1:57:10] up into the sky and he said
[1:57:13] you'll pass or your future before you
[1:57:16] it's clear
[1:57:18] you said friends you cannot imagine how
[1:57:20] I felt
[1:57:22] why because the Lord had forgiven him
[1:57:25] scared to death oh he always wanted to
[1:57:27] go back to Africa again got to go in 65
[1:57:30] couldn't preach he always wanted to
[1:57:32] redeem himself from that that's the way
[1:57:34] we are
[1:57:35] our mistakes our failures our
[1:57:37] shortcomings somehow we want to go back
[1:57:39] and do it again but you know what I'm
[1:57:41] also face facts some of it will never be
[1:57:43] able to do
[1:57:44] all we knew is David did committed into
[1:57:47] the hams of God
[1:57:51] so God takes the first child and the
[1:57:53] Bible says Nathan come to David and said
[1:57:56] go into your wife and comfort her
[1:58:01] so David comforted his wife and she
[1:58:04] brought forth a son
[1:58:06] and called his name
[1:58:08] peace
[1:58:10] Solomon
[1:58:12] but the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to
[1:58:15] them and called his name Jedediah
[1:58:21] beloved of the Lord
[1:58:24] and put his own name yah
[1:58:27] in that name Jedediah
[1:58:30] from the same woman
[1:58:33] that was so broken-hearted
[1:58:36] so maybe it's time for you to be
[1:58:38] comforted by your husband
[1:58:42] the Lord Jesus
[1:58:44] to woo away your anxiety and all your
[1:58:47] burdens and all your trauma of your past
[1:58:50] and let you and him
[1:58:52] be able to produce
[1:58:54] a man of peace
[1:58:57] Solomon
[1:58:59] you already know it but the name
[1:59:01] shulamite
[1:59:03] from The Song of Solomon it's the
[1:59:06] feminist form
[1:59:07] of Solomon
[1:59:11] so the Song of Solomon is about Mr and
[1:59:14] mistress Solomon
[1:59:17] Mr and mistress Jesus Christ
[1:59:22] can we bow our heads together
[1:59:31] I wonder how many today would like to be
[1:59:33] remembered as we
[1:59:36] go before the Lord God bless you your
[1:59:38] need your past your present
[1:59:41] maybe some of it's not so much your past
[1:59:43] that you're dealing with things it's
[1:59:44] just where you are now things got a
[1:59:46] hotel and you hate it you've tried your
[1:59:49] best to shake it but you just can't
[1:59:51] you can't stand yourself you can't stand
[1:59:53] where you are
[1:59:55] let him be the god of your present tense
[2:00:01] what about it Bathsheba
[2:00:03] you bring all the hurt the anxiety the
[2:00:06] pain
[2:00:08] can't trust David you can't trust the
[2:00:10] man that's sent to get him you can't
[2:00:12] trust this one that one the other one
[2:00:14] and yet this man asks
[2:00:17] you to be a part of him with the Union
[2:00:19] takes you to yourself don't even let you
[2:00:21] grieve for your child or your husband
[2:00:25] you're a widow and you're with child how
[2:00:27] you're going to raise that child who's
[2:00:29] going to be there to help you
[2:00:32] Hallelujah
[2:00:35] or can you cast all of that in the hands
[2:00:37] of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:40] those of you that in preacher hurt those
[2:00:42] of you have been hurt by this and that
[2:00:44] and the other
[2:00:45] bring it all to God
[2:00:47] look friends don't make me or any other
[2:00:49] man
[2:00:51] don't put no man to be your idol all men
[2:00:54] will fail you
[2:00:56] there's only one that you can look at as
[2:01:00] your ultimate example and that's the
[2:01:02] Lord Jesus
[2:01:06] he's the only one that will not fail you
[2:01:11] Heavenly fathers we
[2:01:14] open up ourselves to you today
[2:01:19] oh Jesus
[2:01:22] it's painful for me to mention some of
[2:01:25] these things Lord
[2:01:28] there's no doubt some of them stand
[2:01:30] there and I see it on their faces their
[2:01:32] expression
[2:01:34] as they mince
[2:01:37] a frown
[2:01:39] in their corners of mouths will twist up
[2:01:42] and a wrinkle will come on it
[2:01:45] it's because the very salt of their past
[2:01:49] es the dendrites in their brain
[2:01:53] to release hormones
[2:01:57] oh God we all carry our baggage
[2:02:01] we need you Jesus
[2:02:04] we need you
[2:02:07] oh Father
[2:02:08] we bring all we are today
[2:02:12] all our hurts all our anxieties
[2:02:16] some self-inflicted some inflicted by
[2:02:19] others
[2:02:20] we bring them all to you
[2:02:24] Lord God I pray
[2:02:26] may we become the type of woman
[2:02:31] spiritually speaking
[2:02:34] that as your bride the bride of Christ
[2:02:37] can spiritually reflect
[2:02:39] proverbs
[2:02:41] 31.
[2:02:43] unlike the woman of Revelation 17.
[2:02:49] help us Lord to see that woman is so
[2:02:53] different
[2:02:55] but who can find a virtuous woman
[2:03:00] and there are no virtuous people on the
[2:03:02] Earth and the only way you could even
[2:03:04] find one you couldn't find one either
[2:03:07] so what you had to do was make one
[2:03:11] so you place the seed inside the soul
[2:03:14] and waited to the right moment in time
[2:03:17] for that seed to be quickened
[2:03:21] then Lord God under that quickening
[2:03:23] which was our new birth
[2:03:26] then that person never done it in the
[2:03:28] first place
[2:03:30] that's why that we are the virtuous
[2:03:32] sinless
[2:03:34] bride of Jesus Christ
[2:03:38] oh we can still remember those things
[2:03:40] but our seed can't
[2:03:42] because it never done it
[2:03:45] our sin was under that old nature
[2:03:48] that nature that old husband that passed
[2:03:51] away and died
[2:03:52] praise God
[2:03:54] so justification under the opening of
[2:03:56] the seventh seal is not that we get
[2:03:59] forgiveness and we try to patch up that
[2:04:01] old man and try to live with that memory
[2:04:04] but under the opening of the seventh
[2:04:06] seal we never did it
[2:04:09] Hallelujah the lamb takes the book of
[2:04:12] our life and Strikes off the seal
[2:04:16] and calls our seed to birth
[2:04:19] praise the Lord
[2:04:21] help us Jesus
[2:04:23] father may you bring healing today
[2:04:27] not only to those in the visible
[2:04:29] audience but those that are streamed
[2:04:30] those around the world that will hear it
[2:04:32] Lord
[2:04:34] we've been called to the Palace
[2:04:38] but like Bathsheba many of us have
[2:04:42] brought baggage to the Palace
[2:04:45] oh David Fell in Love with their looks
[2:04:48] the Bible doesn't even say knew anything
[2:04:50] about who she was
[2:04:52] in love with her as a person
[2:04:54] but her looks
[2:04:57] so here she comes to the Palace of
[2:05:00] broken-hearted pregnant Widow
[2:05:03] she had to leave her stepchildren David
[2:05:05] did not want them there
[2:05:08] so she comes with all this baggage
[2:05:10] but little by little
[2:05:13] she become a woman
[2:05:14] after God's Own Heart
[2:05:18] in the midst of that chaos
[2:05:21] she found out God had a purpose for her
[2:05:25] not only to be the wife of the king
[2:05:28] but in another time be the mother of the
[2:05:32] king Hallelujah
[2:05:35] the only woman that we have in the Bible
[2:05:37] that would gain that position in that
[2:05:39] same way to become the Queen Mother
[2:05:45] oh Jesus we entered into your courts
[2:05:49] ashamed we entered into your courts with
[2:05:52] a baggage of sin and load of memories
[2:05:55] but may we hear the voice of the king as
[2:05:58] he hears us you see we hear him say come
[2:06:02] my queen
[2:06:04] come my queen let me Comfort you oh my
[2:06:08] Lord how will you comfort me how will
[2:06:11] you bring Comfort to my heart I will
[2:06:14] give you my seed
[2:06:17] you shall bear my seed
[2:06:21] o glory to God glory to God
[2:06:25] for we know through the Gentile bride
[2:06:27] will usher in the Millennium the births
[2:06:30] of the Millennium comes through the
[2:06:32] consummation of the Bride
[2:06:35] thank you Jesus
[2:06:37] Hallelujah when the bride is carried
[2:06:40] away the next great thing that takes
[2:06:42] place on the earth and father in the
[2:06:44] honor of the glory of God is the
[2:06:45] Millennium it will be produced after
[2:06:48] Christ and the Bride of United together
[2:06:51] thank you Lord
[2:06:53] oh Jesus take us Lord
[2:06:56] wash us cleanse us
[2:07:00] purges father
[2:07:04] Hallelujah
[2:07:07] anybody willing to raise your hand to
[2:07:10] the Lord
[2:07:11] just bring all your baggage
[2:07:13] your memories your past your present
[2:07:16] what about your future don't just give
[2:07:18] God your past
[2:07:20] give him your future
[2:07:22] you're young people
[2:07:24] don't take your teams don't take your
[2:07:26] 20s give it to the devil and say I'll
[2:07:28] wait till I'm 40 years old you may not
[2:07:30] live to walk outside this door
[2:07:33] give him everything your past your
[2:07:36] present
[2:07:41] Hallelujah
[2:07:43] Hallelujah
[2:07:46] Hallelujah
[2:07:48] oh Father God
[2:07:51] We Worship You Lord God
[2:07:54] thank you Lord Jesus
[2:07:58] Hallelujah
[2:08:01] let's just keep our hands up there in
[2:08:03] the presence of the Lord now
[2:08:06] he knows exactly what each one of you
[2:08:08] need
[2:08:09] you're streaming from home he knows what
[2:08:12] you need healing in your body
[2:08:13] healing in your spirit maybe you just
[2:08:16] need to unload a bunch of your baggage
[2:08:18] whatever you need
[2:08:20] Jesus is mindful of you
[2:08:23] Hallelujah
[2:08:25] oh don't think that he's going to give
[2:08:27] you
[2:08:28] according to how good John how good your
[2:08:30] past is no
[2:08:32] if it gives us according to that we
[2:08:33] won't none of us get very much
[2:08:36] but let him give to us what He deems us
[2:08:39] worthy to receive
[2:08:41] amen of his Mercy
[2:08:44] of his goodness
[2:08:46] for this is the way he looks at you in
[2:08:48] Psalm 23
[2:08:50] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[2:08:53] me all the days of my life and I will
[2:08:58] dwell in the house of the Lord
[2:09:04] oh praise be to God
[2:09:07] Hallelujah little Branch you're washed
[2:09:11] you're cleansed you're sanctified
[2:09:15] you're forgiven if you're not repent
[2:09:18] right here this morning
[2:09:19] you got something in your life you need
[2:09:21] to repent of do it right now
[2:09:23] and as fast as God forgave David God can
[2:09:26] forgive you
[2:09:28] praise the Lord
[2:09:30] praise the Lord God
[2:09:33] we worship you Jesus
[2:09:36] we bless your name father
[2:09:39] your imagine as Bathsheba would walk to
[2:09:41] the Palace
[2:09:43] and she would look at the full-length
[2:09:45] mirror
[2:09:46] that would be before her maid of
[2:09:48] burnished brass not glass the way we
[2:09:51] have today
[2:09:52] pick up the mirror off of her table
[2:09:55] and look at herself and think who am I
[2:09:58] what am I doing here look at my entrance
[2:10:02] into the king of the Court under
[2:10:05] justification and condemnation
[2:10:07] but now I am the King's wife
[2:10:11] maybe your entrance into his presence
[2:10:14] was condemnation the preacher preached
[2:10:16] right at you and you think Lord have

[2:14:58] oh friends what kind of a
[2:15:01] what kind of a mighty God are we serve
[2:15:04] him
[2:15:05] now be honest with me
[2:15:07] if you had this in your genealogy
[2:15:10] one of them was a woman who dressed like
[2:15:13] a prostitute so she could deceive her
[2:15:15] father-in-law to become with child with
[2:15:17] him
[2:15:18] another one was a known prostitute
[2:15:22] the other one the king of the king of
[2:15:25] Moab was your father eglon
[2:15:28] and you were a moabitus you was a
[2:15:31] priestess to keemosh
[2:15:33] you offered living children to kimash as
[2:15:37] a sacrifice
[2:15:39] then you've got Bathsheba
[2:15:42] would you have a problem and people know
[2:15:44] it well yeah my aunt was a prostitute
[2:15:46] and my aunt before her she was
[2:15:51] we wouldn't hardly want nobody to know
[2:15:52] that would be
[2:15:54] but the Lord Jesus
[2:15:56] allowed this to be in his patronage
[2:16:00] his genealogy why
[2:16:03] so the people who would need him as a
[2:16:05] savior would be able to look at where he
[2:16:08] come from and said if that was in the
[2:16:11] natural family tree
[2:16:13] surely he won't have no problem saving
[2:16:16] me
[2:16:18] so who are we really sinners
[2:16:22] centers that's what we were
[2:16:24] saved by the grace of God
[2:16:28] bless you aren't you happy to be a part
[2:16:30] of the family of God
[2:16:32] why don't you turn around and tell
[2:16:33] somebody I'm so happy to be a part of

[2:17:23] we're so grateful for that also like to
[2:17:26] mention something to you we had some
[2:17:28] curving people to come up over at the
[2:17:30] church to be able to curb the parking
[2:17:32] lot somehow another they got mad and
[2:17:34] left and it wasn't my fault this time I
[2:17:37] never said nothing to him anyway
[2:17:40] um they're supposed to be back tomorrow

[2:18:18] there will be some people in
[2:18:21] construction that will be saved
[2:18:24] God will do it to prove to the devil it
[2:18:28] could be done
