[34:33] [Music]
[34:40] [Applause]
[34:45] [Music]
[34:50] all what a great
[34:52] desire to be able to surrender all to
[34:56] him many of you have been saved for many
[34:59] many
[35:01] years no doubt you're still learning how
[35:04] to surrender more to him aren't
[35:06] you myself I've been saved the majority
[35:09] of my life and about the time you think
[35:12] you think you've got everything
[35:15] surrendered there's something else that
[35:18] you know you have to give up this or
[35:21] that or the other not necessarily sin
[35:23] just opinions ideologies that you have
[35:27] things that you think the Lord would
[35:29] never take from you and yet he does
[35:33] because you realize Paul said the
[35:36] troubles and things that we go through
[35:38] in this life are not even worthy to be
[35:41] compared to the glory that shall be
[35:43] revealed in us at that day to claim the
[35:48] title of being bride it's quite a claim
[35:52] it's an honor for sure but that also
[35:55] means it puts us in a category that's
[35:57] different than a lot of people there's
[36:01] millions of Christian Believers as we
[36:04] would say on the Earth today but I
[36:07] wonder how many of them are
[36:10] disciples a Believer and a disciple is
[36:13] not the same thing the word disciple
[36:16] comes from the word
[36:19] discipline so the bride can be
[36:22] disciplined lot the Believers today oh I
[36:24] believe in the Lord I Want to Go to
[36:26] Heaven I don't want to go to hell I
[36:27] believe in Mercy I believe in grace I
[36:29] believe in all of that but you don't
[36:31] need to wear them clothes now wait a
[36:33] minute don't tell me how I've got a
[36:34] dress don't tell me I can't do this so
[36:37] where do they severs
[36:40] discipline discipline if you have a
[36:43] desire today to be disciplined by
[36:46] almighty God you are a blessed
[36:49] individual if he tells you no you just
[36:52] don't do it that's right because you
[36:55] know that he knows best
[36:58] and if he takes something from you that
[37:00] is so dear and you're trying your best
[37:02] to hold on to it and he still takes it
[37:06] that's when it gets hard to say he knows
[37:09] best how many wants that with all your
[37:12] heart all your heart that's rapturing
[37:17] material friends we've made rapturing
[37:20] material this doctrine that Doctrine
[37:22] this theology this move that move but
[37:25] it's a character that'll match the Lord
[37:29] Jesus that's the kind of people he's
[37:31] going to take from the earth those who
[37:34] are perfect match of him it's like he's
[37:38] been letting these secrets out for
[37:41] thousands and thousands of years it's
[37:44] his own
[37:45] personal desire and his own personal
[37:49] requirement this is who my bride will be
[37:53] she'll be like this she'll be like that
[37:55] she'll be like this she'll be like that
[37:58] and there's something in every
[38:01] believer that wants to be what he wants

[45:57] not your
[45:58] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[46:01] saeth the Lord for as the heavens are
[46:04] higher than the earth so are my ways
[46:07] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[46:11] than your thoughts for as the rain
[46:13] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[46:16] returneth not thither but WTH the Earth
[46:19] and maketh it bring forth and Bud that
[46:21] it may give seed to the swer and bread
[46:24] to the eater so shall my word be
[46:27] that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[46:30] shall not return unto me void but it
[46:33] shall accomplish that which I please and
[46:36] it shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[46:39] sent it hallelujah amen Luke chapter
[46:44] 24 and we'll start at verse 25 come down
[46:47] to about
[46:50] 32 and of course we know the story of
[46:52] the road to
[46:53] Emmas as Jesus walked with his disciples
[46:56] and
[47:00] and Jesus said to them oh fools and slow
[47:03] of heart to believe all that the
[47:05] prophets have spoken ought not Christ to
[47:08] have suffered these things and to enter
[47:09] into his glory and beginning at Moses
[47:12] and all the prophets he expounded unto
[47:14] them in all the scriptures the things
[47:16] concerning
[47:17] himself and they drew nigh unto the
[47:19] village with they went and he made as
[47:21] though he would have gone further but
[47:23] they constrained him saying abide with
[47:24] us for it is toward evening and the day
[47:27] is far spent and he went in to T with
[47:30] them and it came to pass as he sat at
[47:32] meat with them he took bread and blessed
[47:34] it and break and gave to them and their
[47:36] eyes were open and they knew him and he
[47:38] vanished out of their sight and they
[47:41] said one to another did not our heart
[47:44] burn within us while he talked with us
[47:47] by the way and while he opened to us the
[47:51] scriptures amen let's pray heavenly
[47:54] father that's our desire the this
[47:57] morning Lord that you would just come
[47:58] our way and walk with us a little while
[48:01] Lord and as you expound to us the
[48:03] scriptures father I pray Lord that your
[48:06] quickening power would come amongst us
[48:09] Lord and Lord somewhere between Lord the
[48:12] lips of the speaker and the ear of the
[48:14] hearer May the word become a living
[48:16] thing father Lord may it become a fire
[48:18] that would ignite faith in every heart
[48:20] Lord to believe Lord uh the word for our
[48:23] day Lord to see the picture right Lord
[48:26] and not to look at the discouraging
[48:28] things going on father but to find Our
[48:29] Hope and find our peace in the things
[48:32] which are promised for our day Lord
[48:34] it'll only take place if you would come
[48:36] and dwell with us Lord and break the
[48:38] bread of life to us be The Interpreter
[48:40] of your word I pray Lord and it'll make
[48:42] our hearts burn within us come Lord we
[48:45] want to touch you we want to hear your
[48:47] voice so we invite you now Lord and not
[48:49] only invite you but we want to make you
[48:51] welcome come and take control in Jesus
[48:53] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[49:03] seated amen I'd like to preach a sermon
[49:06] to you by the help of the Lord today I'd
[49:09] like to title it the word speaks for
[49:12] itself the word speaks for itself amen
[49:15] and brother Brandon would uh take us to
[49:17] the road to Emmas in the message events
[49:19] made clear by prophecy amen and uh and
[49:22] and I love the way that he would explain
[49:24] it he says he he he draws the picture in
[49:27] this way he says we watch here the word
[49:30] itself quoting the word of himself isn't
[49:33] that amazing it's the word he was the
[49:35] word itself quoting the word of himself
[49:39] amen and and uh he said it's he didn't
[49:41] just come right it's amazing the way the
[49:43] Lord Works he didn't just come right out
[49:44] and tell him that he was that but he let
[49:47] the word speak for itself amen he let
[49:50] the word speak for itself and then they
[49:52] knew who he was now he says this was the
[49:56] word in flesh quoting the word of the
[49:59] letter being fully identified with
[50:02] himself and he says look here now let's
[50:05] listen to him quote amen and amen that's
[50:08] that's what we love uh that's what
[50:11] that's what we long to see take place
[50:13] amen is for the presence of the Lord to
[50:15] come in such a way that he would he
[50:17] would take flesh in this hour amen and
[50:19] that we would not just be uh quoting
[50:21] scriptures and quotes in vain repetition
[50:24] amen but that the word itself would take
[50:26] flesh and it would be the word quoting
[50:28] the word of itself amen we want we want
[50:31] it to speak for itself we want there to
[50:32] be a voice behind our voice amen uh
[50:36] We've uh you know this message has come
[50:38] a long way a long span of time amen and
[50:42] and uh many of you were there from the
[50:43] beginning when it was when it was young
[50:45] and it was fresh and it was a new thing
[50:47] and and now down through a period of
[50:49] time there's a lot of things that have
[50:51] transpired churches have been built and
[50:53] and movements you know and and
[50:55] Ministries have risen and fallen and
[50:57] amen Family Lines have carried on and
[51:00] all these kind of things and we use
[51:01] words around the message that we didn't
[51:03] use before we talk about leges and we
[51:05] talk about we talk about history and we
[51:07] talk about you know we talk about things
[51:09] that happened in the past and things
[51:10] have gone on a little bit of a while and
[51:12] so there's a lot of things that we can
[51:14] look at there's a lot of things that you
[51:16] know a lot of things to be done a lot of
[51:17] things to be said and just a lot of
[51:19] experiences that we've had but there's
[51:21] one thing amen that makes our hearts
[51:23] burn within us is when the Lord comes
[51:25] and makes this message manifest Among Us
[51:28] amen when he vindicates it to be true
[51:30] amen not just when we talk about it not
[51:32] just when we go to a message church not
[51:34] just CU you know not just because we
[51:37] accept it as a lifestyle or a tradition
[51:39] or or a new Creed but when amen when it
[51:42] proves itself among us to be true it
[51:44] causes our hearts to burn within us
[51:45] because we recognize that this message
[51:47] is not just another movement amen or
[51:49] another group or another denomination
[51:51] but it's Christ amen it's Christ
[51:54] revealed Among Us and in US amen and and
[51:56] doing the Greater Works through the
[51:58] Bride of Jesus Christ and so amen that's
[52:00] what that's what causes the True
[52:02] Believer amen that's what causes
[52:04] something to LEAP up in the heart that
[52:05] will burn amen a a passion and and an
[52:08] ignition amen a uh a a revelation a
[52:11] quickening amen of uh of uh of the word
[52:15] and so and so uh I love this story of
[52:17] the road to Emmas because it it it just
[52:20] uh you know it just Catches Us at every
[52:22] point in our journey how that they these
[52:25] two disciples they're real sincere
[52:27] Believers but they're looking at the
[52:28] picture all wrong and they got they got
[52:30] all they're looking at all the world
[52:31] events and you know they're looking at
[52:33] how the Sun is just blacked out and
[52:35] their Earth Shook and amen and and uh
[52:37] and they crucified the word on a Roman
[52:39] Tree and and all the negativity around
[52:41] them was all that they could uh it was
[52:43] all that they could see it was their
[52:45] whole narrative it was their whole
[52:46] understanding of of what was going on
[52:48] and they became discouraged they became
[52:50] depressed on the road to EMAs and and
[52:53] Jesus comes and he joins with them and
[52:55] he begins to minister to them to the uh
[52:57] to them the word is that right but but
[52:59] what is very striking to me about the
[53:01] road to EMAs is that is that here they
[53:03] are it's the word himself amen taking on
[53:07] flesh to quote to them the word
[53:09] concerning himself and yet they're right
[53:12] next to that amen and they could not
[53:14] recognize what was happened can you
[53:16] imagine that that to be on a journey and
[53:19] walking step with step with the promise
[53:21] for their day and not even recognize it
[53:24] amen that's a very that's a very
[53:26] alarming picture and brother Brandon
[53:28] would explain this how that just uh and
[53:31] I'll use his own terminology about it
[53:33] when he draws the picture he says here's
[53:35] the resurrected Messiah amen he's and
[53:38] he's revealing the word to them he's
[53:41] expounding them the scriptures amen uh
[53:44] he preached the word he said he read it
[53:46] out of the scripture and they still
[53:48] didn't get it amen and many times we
[53:50] think that we're doing all right amen as
[53:52] message Believers cuz we can quote the
[53:54] quotes and we can preach good sermons
[53:56] amen and we we got the word we got the
[53:58] word amen amen but you find out that
[54:00] there's many people will walk even years
[54:02] in lock step with the word they're
[54:04] hearing it preach they're hearing good
[54:06] anointed preaching amen but there's a
[54:08] revelation missing which causes them not
[54:10] to get the picture right amen but what
[54:12] we want is for the word to come amen and
[54:15] reveal his presence to us today amen and
[54:17] and show to us amen that we're not just
[54:20] communing with a church we're not just
[54:22] communing with Ministries amen but we're
[54:24] communing with the personal presence of
[54:26] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and and he's
[54:29] the one trying to get the word across to
[54:31] you hallelujah oh my amen it takes a
[54:34] real Revelation and the only way that it
[54:35] comes amen is by his personal presence
[54:38] because they could Journey with him they
[54:39] could be associated with him on the road
[54:42] but it wasn't until he came home and
[54:44] came inside amen it was the indwelling
[54:47] Christ that could take the bread and
[54:49] break it amen and open their eyes so
[54:51] that they could know who they were
[54:52] really dealing with amen you can go to
[54:54] church Sunday after Sunday amen and here
[54:56] brother Donnie preached one of the best
[54:58] amen of the best one of the greatest
[55:00] gifts I believe God gave to the bride
[55:02] amen and you can sit under a Ministry
[55:04] like that amen and be blessed and be
[55:07] edified amen but when but your eyes have
[55:09] got to be open Amen to hear the voice
[55:11] behind the voice to recognize the
[55:13] ministry behind the ministry we're not
[55:16] feeding on the words of a man but it's
[55:18] the body word of the son of man that has
[55:20] been broken open to the Bride of Jesus
[55:23] Christ amen amen we're thankful for all
[55:26] all of his gifts we're thankful for all
[55:27] of his ministries but it takes a
[55:29] personal revelation of Christ to see the
[55:31] message right the intellectual mind will
[55:33] never see it the intellectual mind will
[55:35] always look at the circumstances it'll
[55:37] always be looking at the at at it's
[55:39] amazing how the intellectual mind is
[55:41] obsessed with what's going on in the
[55:42] world Amen it's always looking after
[55:45] politics it's always looking after signs
[55:47] in the heavens and it's always looking
[55:49] after superstitions and and movements
[55:51] and doctrines and theologies amen and so
[55:53] it's never settled it's a it's always
[55:55] fear it's always worried it's always
[55:57] upset amen it's always enraged but the
[56:00] Christian amen amen comes into a little
[56:03] room amen where it's shut off from all
[56:05] the bad things that are happening amen
[56:07] the Christian is shut off from all the
[56:09] dark things of the world Amen having
[56:11] communion amen with the Lord amen and
[56:14] having him break the bread of life to us
[56:16] amen so that we can look on the bright
[56:18] side today and realize we're not
[56:19] journeying in darkness now but we're in
[56:21] the presence of the light
[56:24] amen amen we walk with him amen we walk
[56:28] in the light and he is in the light and
[56:31] so the lesson of the road to Emmas is
[56:33] that the word can be fulfilled it's
[56:35] amazing how the word could be fulfilled
[56:37] right in front of us amen but you won't
[56:39] even be aware of it until he breaks it
[56:42] open amen himself brother Bram said man
[56:45] that could turn on the light he said
[56:47] that's the way that God has today his
[56:49] seed is already he his word we read the
[56:52] scripture amen of the of the picture of
[56:54] the seed how it does not return void
[56:56] that's the word of God Amen and the only
[56:58] thing that seed needs is light on it and
[57:01] the life is what breaks forth and brings
[57:03] forth the life out of the grain that's
[57:05] the way that Christ in the word makes
[57:08] the word do what it's supposed to do
[57:12] isn't that amazing you see it Christ the
[57:14] word it takes that light to make the
[57:16] word do what it's supposed to do so we
[57:18] say well we have the word but is it
[57:20] doing what it's supposed to do amen he
[57:23] said ju it's like the life in a grain of
[57:25] wheat it makes so we do what it's
[57:26] supposed to do because of the life
[57:28] that's in it so life is only by the word
[57:31] of God made
[57:33] manifest life only comes to the word of
[57:36] God made manifest as long as it's just
[57:39] in the book it can still be
[57:42] questioned and it is questioned amen but
[57:46] when it's made
[57:47] manifest then you see the product of
[57:50] what it spoke of being manifested then
[57:53] that is light on the word brother sister
[57:56] they've been talking about this word for
[57:57] 2,000 years but we have received a
[58:00] message in our day amen which has
[58:02] manifested the word manifested the word
[58:05] and the manifested word is our light
[58:08] amen if we we God didn't send a message
[58:10] just so we could talk about it amen he
[58:12] didn't send a message just so we could
[58:14] swap quotes and theorize but the message
[58:17] manifested the word amen and that became
[58:19] light to the true sea the manifested
[58:21] word is light and that's that's uh
[58:24] that's what brother brand will tell you
[58:25] when God is is his own interpreter amen
[58:27] that the way that God Reveals His word
[58:29] is he brings it to pass he brings it to
[58:33] pass that's his method of interpreting
[58:35] the word his method is not theology his
[58:37] method is not mental conceptions amen
[58:40] his that's not his method his method is
[58:42] he puts the light on the seed he sends
[58:45] the rain and then he brings it to pass
[58:47] and amen now and and so we see this
[58:49] picture in Isaiah 55 and it's amazing to
[58:52] me when you run these types amen and you
[58:54] look at look at all the ingredients of
[58:56] the process of God vindicating his word
[58:59] amen amen you got to have the seed but
[59:01] what is the seed it's the word amen he
[59:05] is the seed he's also the Light he's
[59:08] also the
[59:10] rain what am I I'm the ground amen but
[59:13] he's the seed he's the light he's the
[59:16] rain he's the word he doesn't need your
[59:19] help amen uh there's a law in a seed
[59:23] it's a law of Genesis that God
[59:24] instituted amen a seed will always bring
[59:27] forth of its own kind is that right and
[59:29] so and so the way that a seed Works amen
[59:32] the law that's in it is that is that it
[59:34] will grow it will push out and someday
[59:36] it will speak for itself amen many times
[59:38] we take a little seed and we wonder amen
[59:40] what kind of a potential is in that seed
[59:43] what kind of a Destiny is in that seed
[59:45] what kind of fruit amen can that seed
[59:47] bring forth amen but the only way to be
[59:49] sure the only way for is for it to grow
[59:52] forth and manifest itself and bear fruit
[59:54] amen amen that's how God does it and you
[59:57] cannot assist that process you can't
[1:00:00] tamper with that process you can't get
[1:00:02] your mind involved you can't get your
[1:00:03] hands into it amen if you try to help
[1:00:06] that seed along it's not going to bring
[1:00:07] forth life amen but God's law is he put
[1:00:10] the life in the seed in the first place
[1:00:12] and he he sent the light and he sent the
[1:00:15] rain and if you bring that seed into the
[1:00:17] right atmosphere it's going to speak for
[1:00:18] itself and we're going to find out what
[1:00:20] it is that's God's plan to manifest the
[1:00:22] seed that's inside of you amen is that
[1:00:25] he sent a light in this day amen and he
[1:00:27] rained down the Holy Spirit upon a
[1:00:29] church it falls on the just and the
[1:00:31] unjust but it was sent for the wheat
[1:00:33] amen and the rain came amen so that you
[1:00:36] amen could be quickened by the spirit
[1:00:38] amen and come forth and their life
[1:00:40] that's in you is going to speak for
[1:00:41] itself it doesn't need your help it
[1:00:44] doesn't need your interference amen and
[1:00:46] the more that you try to twist it and
[1:00:48] tamper it and control it and regulate it
[1:00:51] amen the more you'll kill it amen that's
[1:00:54] the law of Genesis and amen you got to
[1:00:56] bring it into the right atmosphere
[1:00:58] that's what the spirit of God is for
[1:01:00] that is the purpose of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:02] it is the rain that makes the word live
[1:01:04] amen because we can talk about the word
[1:01:06] and we can theorize about it amen but
[1:01:08] without the Holy Spirit reain to down on
[1:01:09] it it'll never Quicken and it'll never
[1:01:11] live now now I know I know how it is you
[1:01:14] know uh uh uh things that we're dealing
[1:01:16] with around the message today you you
[1:01:17] can't hardly preach the Holy Spirit
[1:01:19] today you can't preach the moving of the
[1:01:21] Holy Ghost without amen without being
[1:01:23] you know without labels getting thrown
[1:01:25] around and and you know you try to
[1:01:26] preach the Holy Ghost and you're a
[1:01:28] Pentecostal and amen you're you're
[1:01:30] you're behind and amen you're you're an
[1:01:32] emotionalist or you're the you're you're
[1:01:34] a fanatic or or or this or that amen and
[1:01:37] amen but but but friends don't stumble
[1:01:39] over the moving of the spirit brother BR
[1:01:41] says it gets so common to us that we
[1:01:43] stumble over it don't stumble over it
[1:01:45] friends amen that's what's making this
[1:01:47] word live it's not how smart we become
[1:01:50] it's not how the church has grown it's
[1:01:51] not what kind of a a high society people
[1:01:54] that we are amen it's the the Holy Ghost
[1:01:57] amen rain has been set Amen in this age
[1:02:00] in this age to bring a bride to
[1:02:03] maturity Hallelujah I I know I know you
[1:02:06] know and so it seems like nowadays you
[1:02:08] can build a whole Ministry just un
[1:02:09] mocking the moving of the spirit and
[1:02:11] amen and just and belittling people and
[1:02:13] amen and and anywhere the Holy Ghost
[1:02:15] moves well they're immature and they're
[1:02:17] amen well friend and I I don't I'm not
[1:02:19] here to be compatitive uh combative amen
[1:02:22] I'm I'm a man of Peace today but but but
[1:02:24] I want to amen uh
[1:02:26] I don't want to have amen I I don't want
[1:02:28] to see the message get to some a place
[1:02:30] where where where it gets so easy just
[1:02:32] to Twist quotes and throw cold water on
[1:02:34] Revival fires I don't want our young
[1:02:36] people to grow up in an environment
[1:02:38] where the spirit is quenched and amen
[1:02:40] where where they're thirsting for water
[1:02:42] we've got an everlasting Supply the
[1:02:44] skies are full amen of the moisture that
[1:02:47] we need to bring seed to to life amen
[1:02:50] amen I know that we've seen fanaticism
[1:02:52] amen I know that we've seen manufactured
[1:02:55] Revival I know we've seen Pentecostal
[1:02:57] Traditions but that's not what I'm
[1:02:58] talking about shouldn't we be looking
[1:03:00] for the Revival the word brought didn't
[1:03:03] the word promis Revival didn't the word
[1:03:05] promise power didn't the word the word
[1:03:08] promise a new birth amen didn't the word
[1:03:10] promise Dynamics didn't it promise a
[1:03:13] rebaptism of the holy spirit amen now
[1:03:16] now if the word promise it it's going to
[1:03:18] come and it's going to speak for itself
[1:03:21] now it may not look like what you
[1:03:23] expected it may not fit your
[1:03:24] sensibilities but hold on a little while
[1:03:27] and let God be his own interpreter amen
[1:03:29] we'll find out what it really is brother
[1:03:32] Bram said God is his own
[1:03:34] interpreter you might not be able to
[1:03:36] explain it but you know you got it who
[1:03:39] can explain God nobody can he said I
[1:03:42] can't tell you how God would show a
[1:03:43] vision but I know it happens amen and I
[1:03:46] can't see how God would do these things
[1:03:48] but I'm glad he said this he said it's
[1:03:50] not my business to explain
[1:03:53] it it's not my business to explain it
[1:03:57] friends amen it's not our business to be
[1:03:59] message explainers it's not our business
[1:04:02] to be message Debaters message
[1:04:04] apologists message philosophers we are
[1:04:07] message manifestors amen we're not put
[1:04:09] here to Amen to try to convince the
[1:04:11] world that it's right we're here to
[1:04:12] prove that it's right amen by by
[1:04:15] becoming the manifested word for this
[1:04:17] day amen this message has got to live
[1:04:19] one of these days amen it's got to
[1:04:21] fulfill itself it's not going to return
[1:04:23] void amen don't we can't turn it into a
[1:04:26] bunch of intellectualism we can't turn
[1:04:28] it into a bunch of traditions amen
[1:04:30] that's not our business but our business
[1:04:33] is the father's business this is
[1:04:35] adoption time it's manifesting time amen
[1:04:38] we got business to be about and it's our
[1:04:41] business Amen to be about the father's
[1:04:43] business and brother Bram said that's
[1:04:45] the secret of the message actually is
[1:04:47] the father's business amen and what is
[1:04:49] the father's business he said it's the
[1:04:51] father's business to fulfill that word
[1:04:55] it's the father's business to fulfill
[1:04:57] that word friends and amen and that's
[1:05:00] what we're doing here that's what it's
[1:05:01] all about friends this message is not
[1:05:04] another Creed God didn't send a message
[1:05:06] so we could go out in the parking lot
[1:05:07] amen and get into some uh uh
[1:05:09] intellectual discussion and try to blow
[1:05:11] somebody's mind and show how spiritual
[1:05:13] that we are amen but God is looking for
[1:05:15] a true church in this day amen to be
[1:05:17] full of the Holy Ghost amen basking in
[1:05:20] the light of the Sun and come amen and
[1:05:22] step into her adoption Authority
[1:05:26] amen if you quench the spirit God can't
[1:05:28] interpret his word amen and then when
[1:05:31] God can't interpret his word when you
[1:05:34] cut off the Holy Spirit then you have to
[1:05:36] descend the only place to go is to
[1:05:38] descend into private
[1:05:40] interpretations amen but we're not the
[1:05:44] interpreters God is his own
[1:05:46] interpreter amen and so we descend in a
[1:05:49] private interpretation you know how uh
[1:05:51] you know how uh some of you men
[1:05:53] especially something happens you know
[1:05:55] I'm I'm a father of three now something
[1:05:57] happens when you become a dad you all of
[1:05:58] a sudden you just uh you got we just
[1:06:00] know everything when we're dads you know
[1:06:03] and so you let somebody let somebody at
[1:06:04] church today let their car break down in
[1:06:06] the parking lot God forbid amen but you
[1:06:08] know somebody's car breaks down and uh
[1:06:11] and uh you know how it is you go out
[1:06:13] there amen the car's broken down
[1:06:14] something went wrong and there's all the
[1:06:16] there's all the
[1:06:19] dads just gathering around something
[1:06:21] they just sense it it just attracts them
[1:06:23] and so you know all the men all these
[1:06:24] men will be standing around and all of a
[1:06:26] sudden everybody's an auto
[1:06:28] mechanic I've never fixed an engine in
[1:06:30] my life but you know there's something
[1:06:32] about it you just be well maybe it's you
[1:06:33] know maybe it's the carburetor or maybe
[1:06:35] it's a you know maybe it's a something
[1:06:37] in the in the exhaust or maybe maybe
[1:06:39] it's this and maybe it's that and see
[1:06:41] see now now you don't have that problem
[1:06:43] when the car is running the way that
[1:06:44] it's supposed to amen but if it runs out
[1:06:47] of gas or something on the mechanical
[1:06:49] side goes wrong all of a sudden
[1:06:50] everybody's an expert amen and the thing
[1:06:52] about it is you know is that everybody's
[1:06:54] opinions valid and everybody cuz nobody
[1:06:56] really knows how to fix the thing amen
[1:06:58] but what you need is the guy who
[1:07:00] designed it remember brother brand
[1:07:02] talked about the engineer coming on the
[1:07:03] side of the road the man the one who
[1:07:05] designed it the one who who made it the
[1:07:08] way it was supposed to be the one who
[1:07:10] knew how it was intended to function
[1:07:12] amen that's the one you need on the
[1:07:14] scene friends amen that's what we need
[1:07:16] in the message when it's not doing what
[1:07:18] it's supposed to do amen when it's not
[1:07:20] producing what it's supposed to produce
[1:07:22] amen then what do we do we all stand
[1:07:24] around and start talking about it it and
[1:07:26] theorizing and I wonder if it's this and
[1:07:28] well my opinion is that amen that's not
[1:07:30] what we're looking for amen I'm not the
[1:07:32] engineer amen of this message I'm not
[1:07:35] the designer of this vehicle amen but
[1:07:37] there is one amen who designed the
[1:07:40] mechanics amen he sent the Dynamics
[1:07:43] Hallelujah and he knows how to make the
[1:07:45] message speak for itself we got to get
[1:07:48] out of his way we got to give them the
[1:07:50] preeminence we got to get back to the
[1:07:53] blueprints amen we got to keep fuel in
[1:07:55] it friends amen see I'm I'm not the
[1:07:58] farmer in this field I'm just a seed and
[1:08:01] so it's not my business it's not my
[1:08:03] business to take care of all these
[1:08:05] things my business is to lay in the
[1:08:07] presence of the Sun and become exactly
[1:08:10] what I came
[1:08:12] from I'm to become exactly what I came
[1:08:15] from I'm a seed and an original seed
[1:08:18] cannot mix with hybrid
[1:08:21] religion hybrid religion now watch watch
[1:08:24] what takes place watch how the word
[1:08:25] becomes hybridized what shall I do with
[1:08:27] Jesus called Christ he said you see
[1:08:30] God's already got it laid
[1:08:32] out the Amen Let the ministry study it
[1:08:36] now you see where it goes wrong God's
[1:08:38] already got it laid out let the ministry
[1:08:40] study it but you see they take somebody
[1:08:42] else's word about it or some group of
[1:08:45] men amen uh and they're so blinded to
[1:08:48] the truth that when the truth is
[1:08:50] presented they fail to see it but you
[1:08:52] see God is just God is just he's got it
[1:08:55] wrote out here amen he's got it wrote
[1:08:58] out he said right here in the book
[1:08:59] what's going to happen today so it will
[1:09:01] be fulfilled and and it's my belief amen
[1:09:04] that when we look down the history of
[1:09:06] the last 60 years amongst message
[1:09:08] Believers we've seen a lot of problems
[1:09:10] we've seen a lot of Amen we've seen a
[1:09:12] lot of unhappy endings and we've seen
[1:09:13] all those things but I believe they all
[1:09:15] boil down to this somewhere somebody got
[1:09:18] somebody else's idea about it amen or
[1:09:21] their own opinion or their own private
[1:09:23] interpretation and got out from under
[1:09:25] the absolute authority of the restored
[1:09:27] word for our day amen you you can't
[1:09:30] you're not going to see it right amen if
[1:09:32] you run with your own opinion amen you
[1:09:34] can't mix it amen with some group of men
[1:09:36] in their opinion Amen in their Direction
[1:09:39] amen the word has already spoken for
[1:09:41] itself in our day amen let the ministry
[1:09:44] study it let the young people listen to
[1:09:46] it amen play the tapes in your homes
[1:09:49] read the books read the Bible amen pray
[1:09:52] for Revelation every day amen you've got
[1:09:54] the ingredients you need to become a
[1:09:57] manifested seed but the problem is we
[1:09:59] get our dirty hands on it amen we try to
[1:10:02] manipulate it to fit amen our
[1:10:04] sensibilities and to fit amen our
[1:10:06] situations friends amen then it won't
[1:10:08] work for us but that's the problem it's
[1:10:11] easier it's easier to take somebody
[1:10:13] else's word for it it's comfortable even
[1:10:17] and try to take a shortcut to the
[1:10:19] truth amen but brother BR said there are
[1:10:22] no shortcuts in the word of God there's
[1:10:24] one pattern
[1:10:25] and you must cut yourself to fit that
[1:10:28] pattern you can't try to cut the pattern
[1:10:30] to fit
[1:10:32] you amen can't pen knife this message
[1:10:36] you can't Whittle away the parts that
[1:10:37] you don't like amen it and it won't
[1:10:40] bring forth life he said everybody must
[1:10:41] do that it's the only way God has of
[1:10:43] doing it now notice now now now I I I
[1:10:46] want to deal with uh some things on the
[1:10:49] topic of identification so watch these
[1:10:51] phrases brother Bram said notice the
[1:10:53] Believers wait for that word to be
[1:10:55] confirmed Believers wait for the word to
[1:10:58] be confirmed cuz a True Believer is
[1:11:00] never going to accept just a religious
[1:11:02] system they're never going to they're
[1:11:04] never going to sit under a Creed amen
[1:11:07] not for long anyway amen but the there's
[1:11:09] something in a True Believer that when
[1:11:11] God makes a promise the believer's
[1:11:12] looking for it to come true they're
[1:11:14] looking for it to be made manifest it's
[1:11:16] an identification a Believer and that's
[1:11:18] why the Vindicated word attracts True
[1:11:20] Believers amen it attracts True
[1:11:22] Believers and friends that's where I
[1:11:24] want to be standing today I'm a young
[1:11:26] man I'm I'm I'm young in my Ministry I'm
[1:11:28] young as a message believer amen and I'm
[1:11:30] looking to build I I'm looking to build
[1:11:32] a family I'm looking to I'm looking to
[1:11:34] you know I'm looking to get under my
[1:11:35] pastor help build a church I'm looking
[1:11:37] to build a Ministry amen I'm looking to
[1:11:39] build today amen so I want to make sure
[1:11:41] I got my Foundation right I don't want
[1:11:43] to build on my opinion I don't want to
[1:11:45] build on my traditions I don't want to
[1:11:47] build with some on on top of some group
[1:11:49] or some movement amen or some private
[1:11:51] interpretation amen if I'm going to be
[1:11:53] standing I want to be standing on on
[1:11:55] something sure and brother BR told the
[1:11:57] story of old mooses you know what he
[1:11:58] said I'd rather be standing on this
[1:12:01] Bible in the hour of my death than to be
[1:12:03] standing in heaven amen cuz heaven and
[1:12:05] Earth shall pass away but there's one
[1:12:08] thing that'll never pass away that's the
[1:12:10] word of
[1:12:12] God Amen now he said so let God's word
[1:12:15] the way that he wrote it no private
[1:12:18] interpretations amen just speak for
[1:12:21] itself when no one has polluted it read
[1:12:24] it
[1:12:25] and believe it now it may seem strange
[1:12:28] some of its quotations but God sometimes
[1:12:31] works in mysterious ways his wonders to
[1:12:33] perform brother Bram said we must
[1:12:36] believe it we must believe it we got to
[1:12:39] see so the True Believer will watch for
[1:12:41] manifestation and now now now we've had
[1:12:43] a lot of private interpretations around
[1:12:45] the message and personality Cults and
[1:12:47] false doctrines and winds amen and all
[1:12:49] these things have transpired and they
[1:12:51] had they were prophesied to come amen
[1:12:54] and but see we watch these things we
[1:12:55] watch the little offshoots and amen we
[1:12:57] watch the little isms amen and we watch
[1:13:00] them and and after these years we can
[1:13:02] look and say look they never did bear
[1:13:05] fruit they never did bear fruit amen any
[1:13:08] life that was in them was grafted out of
[1:13:09] the true Branch but they never did Bear
[1:13:12] the original Fruit amen and so that's
[1:13:14] the thing when they first came some of
[1:13:16] you older ones know all the history some
[1:13:17] of these false teachers came and they
[1:13:19] made a lot of sense amen and they could
[1:13:21] point at certain situations they could
[1:13:24] make a good argument it sounded good to
[1:13:26] a lot of people it was attractive amen
[1:13:28] but the True Believer says hold on Amen
[1:13:30] let's see if it can manifest itself
[1:13:32] let's see if it can really produce the
[1:13:34] goods or is it just a little ism is it
[1:13:36] let a little a fad amen or or or or just
[1:13:40] a little bit of an excitement amen and
[1:13:42] uh and we watch them and they've
[1:13:43] transpired and never did bear fruit amen
[1:13:46] the all that they do amen I've traveled
[1:13:48] places where some of these false
[1:13:49] doctrines have gone amen and pre people
[1:13:52] preaching that he's off the mercy seed
[1:13:53] and anything that anything that moves is
[1:13:55] Pentecostal and amen and the Holy Spirit
[1:13:58] doesn't do the supernatural anymore and
[1:14:00] those kind of teachings I've gone and
[1:14:02] preach in those places you know what it
[1:14:04] did amen all it did was kill the Revival
[1:14:06] and assaulted the Earth and another
[1:14:08] Young Generation never did rise up under
[1:14:10] those teachings amen why cuz it's not
[1:14:12] the Original
[1:14:16] Seed but a True Believer won't settle
[1:14:18] for that they're looking for a true
[1:14:21] manifestation they're looking for the
[1:14:22] message to deliver on the promise
[1:14:25] and it will deliver on the promise if
[1:14:28] you'll take your hands off of it amen
[1:14:31] amen oh my a
[1:14:33] revelation that doesn't bring
[1:14:35] manifestation is in your
[1:14:38] imagination but a Believer will hold out
[1:14:40] for manifestation you it never submit to
[1:14:43] a teaching that can't manifest itself no
[1:14:46] matter how how good it sounds amen but
[1:14:48] that's the way that people are and
[1:14:50] that's the way that Humanity manifests
[1:14:52] itself amen is that things go along and
[1:14:54] people people are always they get a
[1:14:56] little dissatisfied with something and
[1:14:57] it introduces an itch and so the the
[1:15:00] Bible said they've got itching ears and
[1:15:02] and somewhere out in this world there's
[1:15:03] a teacher that'll scratch it amen they
[1:15:05] they got itching ears something they get
[1:15:07] a little dissatisfied they get to
[1:15:08] murmuring or complaining or you know
[1:15:10] they get a bad attitude toward the
[1:15:11] minister amen or whatever it is a little
[1:15:14] bit of family drama any way the devil
[1:15:16] can get in amen and he starts and he
[1:15:18] starts tickling your ears amen and so
[1:15:20] and so that's why that's how uh the
[1:15:23] unbeliever or the makeb believer
[1:15:24] manifest El manifest themselves in the
[1:15:26] End Amen is that they go looking for
[1:15:28] some teacher that'll scratch the itch
[1:15:30] but I want to say when I heard the
[1:15:32] message of the hour it scratched my itch
[1:15:35] it satisfied my soul amen it brought me
[1:15:38] Revival it showed me reality it revealed
[1:15:41] Christ to me amen amen I'm not I'm not
[1:15:45] I'm not lusting after some new theology
[1:15:47] I'm not trying to make the take the
[1:15:49] message and bring it up to date I'm not
[1:15:51] trying to fill our young people's heads
[1:15:53] full of some bible store best seller
[1:15:55] Bible books to our bestseller amen or
[1:15:57] some psychology or theology or some kind
[1:16:00] of a 12-step plan amen the message
[1:16:04] produces the results the message
[1:16:07] delivers on the promise it always has
[1:16:10] and it always
[1:16:12] will let it scratch your itch amen
[1:16:16] accept the absolute amen get under the
[1:16:20] headship which has come down on this day
[1:16:23] amen see see then then you you don't
[1:16:25] have to you don't have to construct some
[1:16:26] convoluted you know uh philosophical
[1:16:29] teaching up in your mind Palace and you
[1:16:32] know and and jam all the pieces together
[1:16:34] no brother Bram said the puzzle will go
[1:16:35] together just right when you let the
[1:16:37] word speak for itself all of a sudden
[1:16:39] your cow eats grass all of a sudden your
[1:16:41] tree bears fruit amen apples come forth
[1:16:44] on your tree amen when you don't try to
[1:16:46] jam something in to fit your private
[1:16:48] interpretation just let the chips fall
[1:16:50] where they may and let the word speak
[1:16:52] for itself amen amen
[1:16:55] the word speaks for itself so I don't
[1:16:57] have
[1:16:58] to remember brother said Jesus said
[1:17:00] follow me follow me and I like the way
[1:17:03] he said it get rid of what you got and
[1:17:06] follow me come on Friends what are you
[1:17:09] following get rid of that thing follow
[1:17:12] Christ in this day and it's the only way
[1:17:14] to have eternal life so brother BR said
[1:17:16] the leadership of God is follow the
[1:17:19] Vindicated word by the Holy
[1:17:22] Ghost you see the mechanics and the
[1:17:24] Dynam
[1:17:25] follow the Vindicated word by the Holy
[1:17:28] Ghost so if you're not preaching the
[1:17:31] Vindicated word amen I I I if it's not
[1:17:34] the Vindicated word amen it's not
[1:17:37] leadership and if the Holy Ghost isn't
[1:17:39] with it it's not leadership but follow
[1:17:42] the Vindicated word by the Holy Ghost we
[1:17:44] want it all friends we want the
[1:17:46] mechanics and the Dynamics I I need the
[1:17:48] Vindicated word and I need the Holy
[1:17:49] Ghost leadership in my life I can't just
[1:17:51] lean on one or the other amen I got to
[1:17:54] go down the midd Middle Brother Brown
[1:17:55] said or it's not going to speak and
[1:17:57] remember he told us about the spirit of
[1:17:58] Beethoven and he warned us about that
[1:18:00] how that how that you know you could
[1:18:02] take you can have the body of Beethoven
[1:18:05] it's got all the it's got all of the and
[1:18:07] the body of Beethoven would have all the
[1:18:09] intelligence in it it would have all the
[1:18:10] skill in the fingers amen it would have
[1:18:12] all the in intellect of the mind it
[1:18:14] would have all the all the functions of
[1:18:16] the body perfectly laying out here
[1:18:18] before us in the body of Beethoven but
[1:18:20] unless the spirit of Beethoven gets into
[1:18:22] the body of Beethoven it'll never
[1:18:24] perform the m Masterpiece amen and
[1:18:26] unless the spirit of God Amen can get
[1:18:28] into the Bride of Jesus Christ you might
[1:18:30] have a many membered body you might have
[1:18:32] a perfect word amen but it's not going
[1:18:34] to live and it's not going to do the
[1:18:36] Greater Works and it's not going to
[1:18:38] deliver on the promise amen cuz we need
[1:18:41] the spirit now now amen so so we need we
[1:18:45] need the true leadership now turn in a
[1:18:47] corner here and the in an absolute
[1:18:49] brother Bram says God Is Right his word
[1:18:52] is Right others are not
[1:18:57] right that kind of bears repeating
[1:18:59] doesn't it God Is Right his word is
[1:19:02] Right
[1:19:04] others not right amen and that's right
[1:19:07] he said as long as they stay with the
[1:19:09] word but when you leave the word you
[1:19:10] leave God cuz God is watching over his
[1:19:13] word I'm glad for that he's watching
[1:19:15] over his word to vindicate it he's got
[1:19:17] he's got to make it real he's got to
[1:19:19] make it act that's why you people are
[1:19:21] hungering for a Revival amen 19 63 in
[1:19:25] absolute he says it's time for these
[1:19:27] things to believe here now he says if
[1:19:29] you ever believe me to know what I was
[1:19:30] talking about you accept that my my how
[1:19:33] many believe brother brandom knew what
[1:19:34] he was talking knew what he was talking
[1:19:36] about he said that's he said it's time
[1:19:38] for these things to be here amen well I
[1:19:42] don't see it brother Nathan he said the
[1:19:44] trouble of it is we got so many
[1:19:46] absolutes that we don't know what we're
[1:19:48] tied to we got so many ties one pulling
[1:19:52] this way and one that way and one
[1:19:53] against the other how do the people know
[1:19:55] what to do amen and the but it's the
[1:19:58] pressure of the holy spirit is coming
[1:20:00] down trying to find a place to move
[1:20:02] himself into amen that he can work word
[1:20:05] by word word by word amen what a what a
[1:20:09] terrible picture that is amen that God
[1:20:11] amen amen has has the time is here for
[1:20:15] Revival The Time Is Here amen for the
[1:20:17] move of God but you find the holy
[1:20:19] spirit's trying to find a place he can
[1:20:21] press into but he's shut out amen by
[1:20:24] System Shut Out by denominational ideas
[1:20:27] Shut Out by private interpretations but
[1:20:29] I would say oh God Amen I want to open
[1:20:32] up the door come in Lord Jesus let the
[1:20:34] Holy Spirit press down into me and Build
[1:20:37] Me Up word by word into what you what
[1:20:40] you predestinated me to
[1:20:42] be hallelujah amen you we we know that
[1:20:46] we know the word is our Plum line you
[1:20:48] guys in construction know what a plum
[1:20:50] line is you you hang it up on an anchor
[1:20:52] amen and it and it and and there's a law
[1:20:54] that governs it amen that that that that
[1:20:57] that Plum line will always hang straight
[1:20:59] it'll always be true because it's
[1:21:02] governed by a law amen and and amen but
[1:21:05] you know what happens is sometimes amen
[1:21:07] we get to looking at the plum line and
[1:21:09] we think man it would just be you know
[1:21:11] what uh it would fit it it would fit
[1:21:13] what I've already constructed if we just
[1:21:16] if we could just move it over a little
[1:21:19] bit or maybe you know oh man you know uh
[1:21:23] my my little private interpretation is
[1:21:25] in the way so maybe if I take the plum
[1:21:27] line just kind of wrap it around and
[1:21:28] then and then get back on track and let
[1:21:30] that hang down friends amen you'll never
[1:21:32] finish the building amen that God will
[1:21:35] never build this house amen the Capstone
[1:21:37] will never come down Amen on a on a
[1:21:40] building which has been constructed amen
[1:21:42] if you don't take your hands off the
[1:21:44] plum line that's what we got to do amen
[1:21:46] get your hands off of this message get
[1:21:48] your opinions out of this message let
[1:21:51] the let the plum line fall amen it's one
[1:21:53] side is tight in heaven amen and the law
[1:21:56] of God has brought it down to earth to
[1:21:58] point us on the straight and narrow path
[1:22:01] you don't have to be smart amen you
[1:22:03] don't you don't have to be you don't
[1:22:04] have to be all that intelligent amen
[1:22:06] he's made the way straight he makes the
[1:22:08] Crooked straight amen he he raises up
[1:22:11] The Valleys amen he brings down the
[1:22:13] mountains Amen to open up a way by the
[1:22:16] plum line it's straight now it's narrow
[1:22:18] but it's straight amen and the Bible
[1:22:20] says a fool cannot Heir in that way
[1:22:25] Amen in other words it's so straight the
[1:22:27] only thing you got to do is take the
[1:22:29] message and keep
[1:22:30] going just don't quit just don't get off
[1:22:33] in a ditch don't get to lean in this way
[1:22:35] don't get to lean in that way amen walk
[1:22:37] on the way and you might be a fool but
[1:22:40] you won't mess
[1:22:41] up you'll get where you're going it's
[1:22:45] foolproof you know what he's looking for
[1:22:47] today is a fool to prove
[1:22:50] it just just a somebody foolish enough
[1:22:53] to believe God and prove prove that the
[1:22:55] word of God delivers on the promise amen
[1:22:58] amen see so many people are so handson
[1:23:01] with the word and they want to take that
[1:23:02] Plum line and get it all twisted up just
[1:23:04] let go amen and and so they're because
[1:23:07] they're just afraid of getting off
[1:23:09] balance I find that I find that you know
[1:23:11] we work a lot with the young people the
[1:23:13] holy spirit will fall you know and God
[1:23:15] will do a work at a youth camp or youth
[1:23:17] meeting something like that and all of a
[1:23:18] sudden they come running out of the
[1:23:19] woodwork and everybody wants to balance
[1:23:20] you
[1:23:23] out heyen
[1:23:25] God sends a shout they got to balance
[1:23:26] the shout God God God brings a dance
[1:23:28] they got to balance the dance and make
[1:23:29] sure just make sure you're not off
[1:23:31] balance now amen now now I believe in
[1:23:33] walking down the middle of the road amen
[1:23:35] God in Simplicity brother random
[1:23:36] instructed us don't get in a fanatical
[1:23:38] ditch don't get in a formal ditch stay
[1:23:39] down the middle of the road friends but
[1:23:41] you know I I've been raised in this
[1:23:43] message 34 years grown up in the message
[1:23:46] amen has has has has kind of programmed
[1:23:48] me a certain way whenever somebody
[1:23:49] mentions the word balance a little red
[1:23:51] flag goes ping
[1:23:55] cuz isn't that the way isn't that the
[1:23:56] biggest weasel word that we got
[1:23:58] sometimes is well oh well we got to have
[1:23:59] a balance I I know brother Bram said not
[1:24:01] to wear shorts but we got to have a
[1:24:03] balance and I know I know I know he
[1:24:04] blasted this and I know there's that
[1:24:06] quote but we got to have a I mean we got
[1:24:07] to have a balance and and so that's the
[1:24:09] thing if you want to come and balance me
[1:24:11] out what are you going to balance me
[1:24:13] with what are you going to balance me
[1:24:15] with cuz I want to stay on balance amen
[1:24:18] but I want to know amen if God
[1:24:20] Vindicated what you're trying to balance
[1:24:22] me with cuz there's such a thing as a
[1:24:24] false balance the Bible says a false
[1:24:26] balance is an Abomination to the Lord
[1:24:29] but a just weight is his Delight amen I
[1:24:32] believe in taking the middle of the road
[1:24:34] but you know what I believe the middle
[1:24:36] is not halfway between you and
[1:24:40] me truth is not 50% between my opinion
[1:24:45] and your opinion I'll tell you what's
[1:24:47] between you and me
[1:24:49] compromise amen but don't oh friends
[1:24:52] don't let a devil come and try to
[1:24:54] balance your freedom with some kind of a
[1:24:56] formal tradition don't let him balance
[1:24:58] your Liberty with his legalism don't let
[1:25:01] the devil balance this message with your
[1:25:04] mental
[1:25:05] conception don't balance my Revival with
[1:25:08] your
[1:25:10] religion you want to try to play Both
[1:25:13] Sides you'll end up on the Wayside but
[1:25:15] if you want a real balance preach the
[1:25:17] message of the hour teach the message of
[1:25:20] the hour believe Amen in the Vindicated
[1:25:23] word for for your
[1:25:25] day you'll stay in the middle of the
[1:25:28] road preach the whole message preach
[1:25:31] nothing but the
[1:25:33] message amen it'll balance itself sooner
[1:25:36] or later somebody's going to have to
[1:25:37] Manifest this message amen so every time
[1:25:40] the spirit of God tries to do something
[1:25:41] Among Us amen if we come running like a
[1:25:43] bunch of firefighters to pour cold water
[1:25:45] on it and make sure that everything's
[1:25:46] just so and make sure everything's
[1:25:48] balance out right amen well then you
[1:25:50] know if we just keep quenching the
[1:25:52] spirit we'll never see it friends but
[1:25:54] sooner or later there's going to be a
[1:25:56] word shout sooner or later there's going
[1:25:58] to be a word dance there'll be word
[1:26:00] tongues word interpretations word
[1:26:03] preaching amen word baptisms amen and
[1:26:06] I'm looking for

[1:26:16] let it speak for itself let God be his
[1:26:18] own interpreter this message is going to
[1:26:21] live amen it's going to produce it may
[1:26:23] not fit your
[1:26:26] sensibilities but if it's according to
[1:26:28] the word if it fits the word just let it
[1:26:29] speak for
[1:26:31] itself brother B said I don't believe in
[1:26:33] fanaticism who here believes in
[1:26:35] fanaticism it's what I
[1:26:38] thought I don't believe in fanaticism I
[1:26:41] wouldn't stand for it the prophet said
[1:26:43] and I know you don't believe in
[1:26:44] fanaticism you believe in the truth and
[1:26:47] he said and truth will always speak for
[1:26:48] itself that's right you never have to
[1:26:50] strain
[1:26:52] truth truth truth will always be truth
[1:26:57] you see what a people to get in the
[1:26:58] ditch on the other side they know God
[1:27:00] promised a Revival they know great
[1:27:01] things and they try to get like Moses
[1:27:03] and in their intellectual Faith they try
[1:27:05] to pump something up and they try to
[1:27:06] take matters into their own hands well
[1:27:08] you might kill yourself a measly
[1:27:09] Egyptian that way but you're not getting
[1:27:11] the people out of here amen but so and
[1:27:13] so and so it's just the same amen when
[1:27:15] we try to manufacture a Revival and we
[1:27:18] think well you know uh and we start
[1:27:19] pressuring the people well if you don't
[1:27:21] dance if you don't shout if you don't
[1:27:23] something's wrong with you friends you
[1:27:24] shouldn't have to strain truth it's just
[1:27:27] another form of legalism it's just
[1:27:29] another form of formalism Amen but let
[1:27:31] the truth amen be preached let the Holy
[1:27:34] Spirit back it up you won't have to
[1:27:36] strain it you won't have to push it you

[1:27:40] delivers on the promise I'm a witness of
[1:27:43] it truer Tabernacle is a witness of it
[1:27:46] amen Word of Life is a witness of it how
[1:27:49] many are witness amen that the word amen
[1:27:52] if you take your hands off it don't try
[1:27:54] to help it don't try to baby that seed
[1:27:56] don't try to peel it open before it's
[1:27:58] ripe let it bask in the light of the sun
[1:28:00] amen preach the message to it let the
[1:28:02] Holy Spirit move over it amen and if
[1:28:04] it's a true seed it'll speak for itself
[1:28:07] in spite of you in spite of when we mess
[1:28:09] up in spite of things go wrong in spite
[1:28:12] of all the water under the bridge the
[1:28:13] message is still going to put a bride in
[1:28:16] a
[1:28:17] Rapture hallelujah oh don't strain it
[1:28:20] Friends when the light of this manifest
[1:28:22] of word strikes the seed it will Quicken

[1:28:29] believe that's what we
[1:28:32] do you say well how do you how do you
[1:28:34] recognize a Believer they
[1:28:36] believe amen and brother brandom we'll
[1:28:39] begin to deal with our identification
[1:28:41] Vince made clear he says when the true
[1:28:42] Bible Believers see the word so openly
[1:28:45] Vindicated for the age they believe and
[1:28:49] you know what there's no way to keep
[1:28:50] them from it they believe it they even
[1:28:53] seal their testimony with their blood
[1:28:55] they believe it so it's to them then
[1:28:59] it's to them the predestinated that for
[1:29:01] that certain age that sees and believe
[1:29:04] so God has a predestinated seed
[1:29:07] somewhere amen that when the light
[1:29:08] flashes across them something on the
[1:29:10] inside's going to Quicken and they're
[1:29:12] going to believe it and they're going to
[1:29:13] believe it amen because they're
[1:29:15] predestinated to do it and what's the
[1:29:16] evidence of predestination amen is to
[1:29:19] believe the Vindicated word amen uh God
[1:29:23] identified by characteristics amen when
[1:29:26] you're looking for the evidence of the
[1:29:27] Bride in this day Amen brother brand
[1:29:29] would give us the evidence but he would
[1:29:31] go down through all the false evidences
[1:29:33] he would say you know Luther said when
[1:29:34] you believe you've got it and the
[1:29:37] Methodist says when you shout you got it
[1:29:40] when the Pentecostal said when you spoke
[1:29:42] in tongues you had it and brother Bram
[1:29:44] said we find all of that's
[1:29:47] wrong it's all wrong and some of them
[1:29:50] said now this is a great big statement
[1:29:52] if this don't knock you out of your
[1:29:53] shoes amen he says some of them say the
[1:29:56] fruit of the spirit has got it amen and
[1:29:59] it's wrong and you know he'll take you
[1:30:01] to those kind old priests and all the
[1:30:03] things that they could imitate but
[1:30:04] there's one thing that cannot be
[1:30:05] imitated amen and that is the quickening
[1:30:07] of the seed amen and when it comes forth
[1:30:10] amen it reproduces the original amen
[1:30:13] under the True Light under the true rain
[1:30:15] a true seed amen will replicate the
[1:30:17] original and that's something only you
[1:30:19] can do brother Bram said the only
[1:30:20] evidence is Vindication when God himself
[1:30:24] identifies himself in the promised word
[1:30:26] of the hour amen see we we 2,000 years
[1:30:29] we've been trying to sort it out amen
[1:30:31] but thank God he sent a message in our
[1:30:33] day and God himself came on the scene
[1:30:36] and spoke for himself and Vindicated
[1:30:38] that message unto us and you know what
[1:30:39] the Believers do they believe the
[1:30:41] message they Quicken to life under that
[1:30:43] light amen and they come up under their
[1:30:45] maturity under it and at no point in the
[1:30:48] process amen can you move them to a hot
[1:30:50] house and put them under an artificial
[1:30:52] interpretation amen see amen God himself
[1:30:55] identifies himself and the real evidence
[1:30:58] of a true seed is they receive and
[1:31:00] accept and believe the Vindication amen
[1:31:03] when the word speaks it is speaking
[1:31:07] identification you say what well okay
[1:31:09] the word speaks for S brother Nathan God
[1:31:11] sent a message but what is the message
[1:31:13] some of you young people have never
[1:31:14] you've been raised in it but you never
[1:31:15] asked yourself that question what is the
[1:31:17] message what is the message put it in a
[1:31:20] paragraph explain it to me oh yeah you
[1:31:23] know God s a prophet you know we believe
[1:31:25] a message what does it say Amen but you
[1:31:27] find out this message is a message of
[1:31:29] identification Christ has come Amen to
[1:31:32] Bear witness to the true seed in this
[1:31:34] age amen and so when the light flashes
[1:31:36] over you your response to that light
[1:31:39] amen is going to prove who you are and
[1:31:41] identify you as a true seed of God Amen
[1:31:45] oh my the word interpreted brother Bram
[1:31:47] said is the manifestation of the name of
[1:31:50] God Amen so he's identifying people
[1:31:53] which are called by his name I I wish we
[1:31:55] had time to Amen to to get in all these
[1:31:57] things amen but brother man would say
[1:31:59] the word interpreted becomes the name of
[1:32:01] God Amen and he then where does he take
[1:32:04] you from there he takes you right to
[1:32:05] Peter amen he actually at that time was
[1:32:08] Simon barjona and he takes you right to
[1:32:10] Peter amen how how many know that Peter
[1:32:12] had a revelation amen he that that that
[1:32:15] scripture that's not that's not about
[1:32:16] popes that's about Revelation amen and
[1:32:19] so and so uh Jesus amen is asking all
[1:32:22] the disciples amen and he's he's trying
[1:32:24] to ask him who do men say that I am and
[1:32:26] they could all talk the talk they were
[1:32:28] all up on the current events oh yeah you
[1:32:30] know that guy over there he's preaching
[1:32:31] this and that one over there you know
[1:32:33] and we've had that movement and this and
[1:32:34] then he said but who do you say who do
[1:32:36] you say that I am amen and there were so
[1:32:39] many of the disciples amen that lacked
[1:32:41] Revelation and all that they had was a
[1:32:43] bunch of suay some say you're Elijah
[1:32:46] some say you're that Prophet some say
[1:32:48] you're Moses some say some say some say
[1:32:50] and that's what we got too much of
[1:32:52] around the message of the hour it's
[1:32:53] somebody body got just enough amen uh
[1:32:55] they got just enough understanding to
[1:32:57] join a church amen join a group grow up
[1:32:59] in a family adopt a lifestyle amen some
[1:33:02] say well brother Donnie said amen well
[1:33:04] brother Wayne said brother Nathan said
[1:33:07] brother brandom said amen but who do you
[1:33:09] say who do you say that this message is
[1:33:13] come on it's on your hands today what
[1:33:15] are you going to do with it but thank
[1:33:17] God Peter had a revelation something
[1:33:20] stirred up in his heart it wasn't flesh
[1:33:22] and blood that gave it to him it wasn't
[1:33:23] because he was so well educated it
[1:33:25] wasn't how many times he read the church
[1:33:27] age book it was a revelation from God
[1:33:30] striking a true seed amen and he raised
[1:33:33] up and he said you are
[1:33:36] Christ amen I remember when it happened
[1:33:38] to me amen when the light flashed before
[1:33:41] my eyes and the message that I grew up
[1:33:43] hearing amen jumped off the pages and
[1:33:46] spoke to me Amen in the voice of
[1:33:48] Christ amen and something my heart said
[1:33:51] this is not just the church that I
[1:33:53] belong to too this is not just the
[1:33:55] family I was raised in this is the
[1:33:59] Christ and he has coming my day to speak
[1:34:02] to
[1:34:04] me and identify me cuz that's what the
[1:34:07] Revelation does Amen the because the
[1:34:09] Revelation said Thou Art the Christ and
[1:34:11] the further Revelation turned back
[1:34:13] around and said yes I am and you are
[1:34:17] Peter amen he wasn't Peter before that
[1:34:21] but he had a name change amen cuz when
[1:34:23] the word spoke for itself it changed his
[1:34:26] identification it changed his identity
[1:34:28] that's what it did for me amen there's a
[1:34:30] whole list of sins and shortcomings amen
[1:34:33] that you can attach to the name of
[1:34:34] Nathan Ericson but Nathan Ericson is not
[1:34:37] my
[1:34:38] identification but a message is coming
[1:34:40] this day amen to speak for itself amen
[1:34:44] and reveal to me I am of
[1:34:46] Christ I'm married to
[1:34:49] him and I'm known by his name I carry
[1:34:52] his reputation
[1:34:54] oh friends amen you need a personal
[1:34:57] revelation of Jesus
[1:35:00] Christ amen but if but see what it does
[1:35:02] it turns around and it identifies you
[1:35:06] back oh my we get we stress and strain
[1:35:09] looking for the evidence trying to find
[1:35:11] something to hold on to trying to shout
[1:35:13] enough dance enough speak in tongues or
[1:35:14] something Amen to to Amen to have enough
[1:35:17] Faith but friends it's your revelation
[1:35:20] of this word it's this light it's this
[1:35:22] rain amen the life that it is quickened
[1:35:25] inside you is the evidence and it might
[1:35:27] look humble now but give it time amen
[1:35:30] and keep it in the right atmosphere and
[1:35:31] it'll speak for
[1:35:33] itself Flesh and Blood doesn't reveal it
[1:35:36] the true revelation of this message is a
[1:35:38] personal
[1:35:39] revelation God is identifying your name
[1:35:41] on his book God sent a prophet to tell
[1:35:43] you what God was thinking about before
[1:35:45] the foundation of the world what was he
[1:35:46] thinking about
[1:35:48] me me cuz my name was on his book Amen
[1:35:53] brother said there were names in there
[1:35:55] that were put in there from the
[1:35:56] foundation of the world but as long as
[1:35:59] those names had never been manifested in
[1:36:01] Earth yet amen he had to stay there as
[1:36:04] an intercessor as long as there's one
[1:36:07] name that hasn't been declared in this
[1:36:09] earth Christ has to stay there as an
[1:36:11] intercessor what's he doing brother BR
[1:36:13] said he's taking care of that
[1:36:17] name Hallelujah friends you didn't get
[1:36:20] here by accident you didn't stumble into
[1:36:22] this message

[1:36:28] to call you out of this world call you
[1:36:30] out of this Darkness Amen to Quicken a
[1:36:32] seed on the inside of you Amen to prove
[1:36:34] to you that he was thinking about you
[1:36:36] before the foundation of the world and
[1:36:38] if your name was on his book amen he's
[1:36:41] going to take care of that name amen cuz
[1:36:43] it's not your name and your reputation
[1:36:46] that he's defending but it's his
[1:36:49] name Prophet even said Q&A on the seals
[1:36:52] amen he said it's not just exactly you
[1:36:54] know Orman Neville will be saved on this
[1:36:55] day and you know it's not it's not like

[1:37:07] what I'm saying is Amen in this day the
[1:37:10] under the voice of the seventh angel the
[1:37:12] mystery was finished and the fact that
[1:37:15] you received it amen the fact that you
[1:37:17] believed it the fact that it quickens
[1:37:19] something inside of you proves you were
[1:37:21] part of that mystery all along your name
[1:37:23] was on his book I know this I know
[1:37:26] there's a lot of things the devil would
[1:37:27] like a pen to the book of your life and

[1:37:31] and all your mistakes and all your
[1:37:33] failures amen and and the devil keeps a
[1:37:36] record on the book of life amen but on

[1:37:47] record there all the all the failure he
[1:37:49] doesn't record the background that you
[1:37:51] came out of he doesn't record your
[1:37:53] lowest moments he doesn't record your
[1:37:56] struggles but written there Amen in red
[1:37:58] ink is the name of his elected seed amen
[1:38:02] and the light is flashing this day to
[1:38:04] Quicken you and prove to you amen that

[1:38:42] thinking about it amen but it's not

[1:40:49] that little confirmation just to have
[1:40:51] that little nudge amen something I could
[1:40:54] hold on to God's Prophet saw something
[1:40:55] in me but
[1:40:58] friends God saw something in me amen and
[1:41:01] when I received the revelation of this
[1:41:03] message it was such an identification to
[1:41:05] me amen I don't see see see there's
[1:41:07] something about it it's my reality it is
[1:41:10] my world it is my passion something on
[1:41:12] the inside of me screams out it jumps
[1:41:14] and says Amen to every word of it amen
[1:41:17] why because I'm identified Amen in the
[1:41:20] message for the hour I don't need to
[1:41:22] wait for brother brandom to come back
[1:41:23] and get in a little room of a tent
[1:41:25] somewhere and have him tell me who I am
[1:41:27] amen I've already received my

[1:41:32] has come to you church amen I no longer
[1:41:35] call you church I call you bride you're
[1:41:38] known by my
[1:41:39] name except the identification of the
[1:41:42] hour that's that's my identification not
[1:41:46] in what a prophet told me not in what
[1:41:47] some man said not in the preacher that
[1:41:49] prayed over me amen but it's the
[1:41:51] Vindicated word of the hour that has
[1:41:53] identified me cuz brother Bram said when
[1:41:55] you recognize the very word of God was
[1:41:57] Eagle food you heard from your
[1:42:01] theophany woo there was a predestinated
[1:42:04] germ that was in you for this hour and
[1:42:06] amen amen and brother Brown said when
[1:42:09] the anointed word of God is Vindicated
[1:42:11] before amen somebody with that
[1:42:13] predestinated germ he will see God's
[1:42:15] message as sure as there's a God in
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:20] heaven why was it when this light
[1:42:22] flashed across you you left that system
[1:42:24] you were in you turned down those
[1:42:26] denominational Creeds your family turned
[1:42:28] away from you your friends turned away
[1:42:30] from you but something in your soul said
[1:42:33] amen I've heard that eagle scream amen
[1:42:35] that's where I belong I don't belong
[1:42:37] down here with the chickens pecking for
[1:42:39] my daily meal but I was created and
[1:42:42] predestinated to soar in Heavenly places
[1:42:46] in Christ I'm an
[1:42:51] eagle amen and you left everything to
[1:42:54] follow this message why cuz you belong
[1:42:56] to it amen you are part of the mystery
[1:42:59] amen all the mystery of God has been
[1:43:00] revealed in this day and it's not all
[1:43:02] seven seal and third pole and water
[1:43:05] baptism and serpent seed but it's names
[1:43:09] that were mysteriously recorded on his
[1:43:11] book but the mystery has been
[1:43:13] revealed amen amen and my response to
[1:43:17] the Vindicated word has proved that I
[1:43:20] was one of those mysterious ATT
[1:43:23] attributes which he kept in his heart
[1:43:25] down through eons of time he carried
[1:43:28] though he carried that secret amen he
[1:43:30] didn't show it to anybody it was never
[1:43:32] revealed under Moses Ministry it was
[1:43:34] never revealed under Isaiah's Ministry
[1:43:36] it wasn't revealed under Malachi amen
[1:43:38] but when the Lord Jesus Christ came he
[1:43:41] carried the mystery in his heart amen of
[1:43:43] all those attributes that were on his
[1:43:44] book he carried Me to the Cross amen
[1:43:48] amen but when he went down to the grave
[1:43:50] and when he came out of that grave amen
[1:43:53] he carried me with him amen I was there
[1:43:56] I was identified in him and now in this
[1:43:58] day identification has come once again
[1:44:01] to prove that it's
[1:44:03] so I'm a part of my savior I'm a part of
[1:44:07] his
[1:44:08] word I can really see now who I am who I
[1:44:14] am Oh
[1:44:18] Glory there's fine people in this world
[1:44:22] fine churches
[1:44:24] but he said there's one Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:44:26] that's who he's coming for that's where
[1:44:29] his name
[1:44:31] lays that's where his worship is in her
[1:44:34] and her alone what does it mean to be
[1:44:36] the Bride of Jesus Christ it means
[1:44:38] you're the
[1:44:40] word not just a letter word that that'll
[1:44:43] kill amen but you are the spoken word
[1:44:47] seed amen God thought of you brother BR
[1:44:50] said he spoke it and here you are
[1:44:54] what a privilege to stand here in the
[1:44:55] pulpit and look out at what God was
[1:44:56] thinking about before the foundation of
[1:44:59] the world brother Bram said if the word
[1:45:01] is in you you and the word are the
[1:45:04] same all the word is you
[1:45:09] are if I'm living in this
[1:45:12] generation he said what this portion of
[1:45:15] word has promised for this
[1:45:18] generation I've got to be
[1:45:21] that I've got to be that don't turn that
[1:45:24] into legalism now don't turn that into
[1:45:26] works oh I've got to be that
[1:45:28] no amen all the word is I am and what it
[1:45:33] has spoken for of this day I'll be
[1:45:36] that because if I'm a true
[1:45:39] seed I'll speak for
[1:45:42] myself let's all
[1:45:49] stand what a message
[1:45:53] the personal presence of Christ here on
[1:45:55] the earth in a flesh body but it's a
[1:45:59] many-membered
