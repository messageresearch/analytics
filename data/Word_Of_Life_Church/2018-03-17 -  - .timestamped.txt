[8:16] Lord I was just sitting there thinking
[8:18] Lord it every one of us has got a little
[8:21] lake of fire and if I was 4 or 500 of us
[8:24] coming only a hundred of us that are
[8:27] links fell out it wouldn't be a very big
[8:30] fire but if all four of them a hundred
[8:33] licks would go get together and then
[8:36] when another lick comes out here and he
[8:38] begins to press and preach the word I
[8:41] believe that something would happen here
[8:43] tonight God that we see the move of God
[8:45] and we see the presence of God just like
[8:48] it was here just recently Lord when you
[8:50] came down in such a great way father
[8:52] there was such a presence here that you
[8:55] couldn't even hardly lift your hand up
[8:57] God Lord in in the presence of smoke so
[9:00] thick it was just almost like putting it
[9:03] up in in in glory God so tonight we
[9:06] thank you Lord for your
[9:07] presents God and we invite your presence
[9:10] in here tonight God may you come and may
[9:13] you be a bountiful Lord in every heart
[9:15] here you're not God or they're sick
[9:17] people among us God or there's people
[9:19] God that I'm sure going to a lot of
[9:22] depressions God what I know we get we
[9:25] get buffeted ever David Satan he's a
[9:28] good he's a good Buffett or he knows how
[9:30] to Buffett God and sometimes he'll push
[9:33] until you think Lord he's gonna push you
[9:35] come over the edge of the cliff Lord but
[9:37] God you're always on the throne so we
[9:39] know God that you're a way maker father
[9:41] so we intend to not God to depend on you
[9:44] Father for every blessing for every need
[9:46] in our lives today God these requests I
[9:49] have in my hand god you're able God and
[9:51] you're the healer you're the only one
[9:53] that can heal we could a doctor can give
[9:56] you a pill a doctor can cut on you but
[9:58] he can't heal you God
[9:59] it takes you Father so we put it all in
[10:02] your hands tonight Lord and may you come
[10:04] tonight father and may you come we
[10:06] entertain you to come Lord and be in our

[34:32] unbelief they were able to be in this
[34:37] place because of a miraculous deposit
[34:42] that God had placed in them both when
[34:45] they were made brother Bream tells us in
[34:48] oneness with God the first man and first
[34:51] woman in the Garden of Eden was in
[34:54] perfect harmony with God so much that
[34:58] God could come down at any time he
[35:01] desired and taught lip to ear was Adam
[35:05] and Eve now that is perfect oneness God
[35:11] in His creation God speaking lip to ear
[35:16] was Adam and Eve they were so perfect
[35:20] harmony with God till they were one with
[35:23] God God and his family one now in this
[35:28] we will see the great purpose of father
[35:33] supreme
[35:35] he's not just father he's father supreme
[35:41] notice in paragraph 16 that's God's
[35:44] purpose his purpose as father supreme
[35:49] was to be one with his family earthly
[35:54] family Adam and Eve and the only way
[35:57] they could be one with the family or God
[36:00] was because God's nature was in them so
[36:07] that made them with God's nature in them
[36:09] then with each other and God they all
[36:12] become all one isn't that a beautiful
[36:16] picture God and his family father
[36:21] overall supreme no death no sorrow no
[36:27] heartaches Lord no messing just joy
[36:32] unspeakable
[36:33] never to be sick never to have a
[36:36] heartache just one with God what a
[36:39] picture because the nature of God was in
[36:45] these people now this is going to be
[36:48] relevant to your restoration the nature
[36:54] of God was in these people therefore
[36:55] what they did they followed just in line
[36:58] with God and God made them what is the
[37:03] only grounds of fellowship that God has
[37:06] ever laid down for himself in his church
[37:09] is the oneness of himself in the people
[37:13] this is why joining the church even
[37:16] coming to the message coming to Happy
[37:19] Valley or any other message Church does
[37:22] not make you one with God there's only
[37:26] one way you can be one with God and that
[37:29] is God's nature living in you that can
[37:33] only come by God himself
[37:35] departing or importing rather His divine
[37:38] nature by a new verse it transforms us
[37:43] those of us that were born outside of
[37:46] Eden's gates and by the new birth we are
[37:50] transformed and moved back inside were
[37:54] the cherubims and said of now keeping us
[37:56] away the cherubims drive us toward the
[37:59] gate notice is the only grounds he said
[38:03] by a union to be united with him forever
[38:07] just like when you unite with your
[38:09] husband the woman to unite with her
[38:12] husband it is a violent to death now
[38:15] then if you unite was God it's the same
[38:17] thing that the church United was Christ
[38:20] until its death we part and then if you
[38:23] never sinned or do anything wrong you'll
[38:26] be eternally United with God and only
[38:31] deaths can take you away from God in our
[38:34] physical death but the sin of this sin
[38:36] is death and that takes you away from
[38:38] God so to be United
[38:41] here in the spirit and the power is
[38:44] eternal life
[38:46] you're eternally United with God
[38:50] oh I want to get to that extra bit
[38:52] United eternally with the eternal God
[38:56] perfect in harmony with him listen to
[38:59] this perfectly United together a church
[39:02] that almost God and His Church you
[39:05] knotted together do you believe that do
[39:09] you believe that is parts of this is
[39:13] already in this building right here
[39:15] tonight and the hearts of many of you
[39:18] sings now don't you see the great
[39:20] picture we are in first we are different
[39:23] and we're out like a by-product a
[39:25] creative being by holy wedlock but in
[39:28] spirit we are sons and daughters not
[39:32] some other spirit amen
[39:35] notice now not some other spirit but the
[39:39] Spirit of the Living God we are in his
[39:42] likeness in his unity in the perfect
[39:46] image in the of the Living God because
[39:50] we become sons and daughters not
[39:53] separated but the same spirit the same
[39:56] God the same person glory
[40:00] joined in wedlock to the eternal see how
[40:04] God planned it that we should be not I
[40:08] different but him not a different but
[40:13] him not some other being or of some
[40:17] other tribe but a real Union and
[40:20] offspring of the Almighty
[40:23] done by a holy Union and the church said
[40:27] now the body comes from mother and
[40:30] father but the Spirit comes from God God
[40:32] separating himself as Adam of separating
[40:36] notices joint and heavenly what look -
[40:41] the
[40:42] Cornel God part of him part of God join
[40:50] to the eternal God by heavenly wedlock
[40:56] so you can see it's not joining a church
[40:59] not shaking or preachers hand not even
[41:02] playing tapes not even attending a
[41:04] certain assembly only God can be able to
[41:07] do this great work now let us go back
[41:11] now and go into this great paradise
[41:15] again it is the initial stages of the
[41:20] first deposit of the family of God it is
[41:25] not the only members that he has but
[41:28] let's say it this way it would have been
[41:30] the first ones in the Lamb's Book of
[41:33] Life that he chose to deposit in the
[41:37] realm of humanity this is God's first
[41:40] sign that he wanted to live could have
[41:42] been Jim and Linda could have been me
[41:44] and Carol could have been you and your
[41:45] life could have been you and your life
[41:47] but God chose for it to be Adam and Eve
[41:49] but needless to say all the rest of
[41:53] those sons and their sweet hearts will
[41:56] be manifested in their time but for
[41:59] whatever reason God chose to exhibit in
[42:02] the first display and the Garden of Eden
[42:04] this first son Adam and his wife or his
[42:07] sweetheart II then this great power dice
[42:10] of God were not sure how long that they
[42:13] were able to live there because the
[42:15] relevance apparently of that is not
[42:17] significant to us because Moses did not
[42:19] mention it but we could imagine in her
[42:23] mind that it would have went on and on
[42:24] and on it might have been hundreds of
[42:26] years it might have been thousands of
[42:28] years time really did not matter because
[42:30] they were joined together in this union
[42:33] by God but in the way that God had
[42:37] deposited this divine nature in them was
[42:40] a way which could be separated from them
[42:44] yet not removes their name from the
[42:47] Lamb's Book of Life now a little bit
[42:49] different than from the way you
[42:51] when I receive it today in that we are
[42:54] sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:56] and that nature sealed in us but however
[42:59] God allowed it to be placed in Adam and
[43:02] Eve he knew that it was on a basis which
[43:05] would be temporary and he knew that Adam
[43:08] would actually forfeit the right to be a
[43:11] partaker of this divine nature so
[43:13] whether it was by importation of a time
[43:16] that God allowed the man and the woman
[43:19] to protect of it but we believe
[43:21] according to what we've read tonight
[43:23] that they did have God's nature in them
[43:26] you'll agree with that now it was in
[43:29] there but it was not in them and a
[43:32] permanency but it was in them for an
[43:35] element of time that the greater
[43:38] attributes of God might be expressed now
[43:42] you're there in this beautiful beautiful
[43:44] paradise of God Adam knows enough about
[43:47] the program of God to know that there's
[43:49] some sort of wrong there he knows enough
[43:52] about what God has said that he's placed
[43:55] in the Garden of Eden to dress and to
[43:56] keep it and they be able to maintain his
[43:58] supervision and dominion over it
[44:00] God doesn't go into the details God
[44:02] doesn't tell him watch for the serpent
[44:04] watch for this watch for that but God
[44:06] gives him enough for him to be able to
[44:08] be aware that there's something around
[44:10] where he's gonna have to watch it now in
[44:13] this no harm could come to them all the
[44:16] great birds that were there all the
[44:18] animal life everything was saying
[44:20] nothing was carnivorous everything
[44:21] eating vegetation the earth standing
[44:24] upright the same temperature all the way
[44:27] around no tilting of the axis twenty-two
[44:29] and a half degrees same temperature
[44:31] everywhere everything was absolutely
[44:33] perfect and the paradise of God the
[44:36] great dinosaurs were coming through the
[44:38] paradise of God and the birds of
[44:40] paradise would land over on Adams
[44:42] shoulder and they would COO to him and
[44:44] Adam would speak to him and everything
[44:46] was absolutely wonderful
[44:48] but yet God knew this would only last
[44:51] for a time now god of course is not
[44:54] going to make the man fall from this
[44:56] beautiful estate but he places a man on
[44:59] a probationary period in the Garden of
[45:01] Eden remember the Angels which are not
[45:03] elect were placed on the same probation
[45:06] so was Lucifer placed on a probation
[45:09] period that he could make his choice but
[45:11] the legs are not placed on probation
[45:14] they're placed on predestination well
[45:18] glory now what's this brother RAM goes
[45:20] on he says there was no harm that could
[45:23] calm the tiger lay down leo the lion lay
[45:25] down
[45:25] nothing would harm them then along comes
[45:28] sin rather it spoiled that beautiful
[45:30] picture Eve would have never needed
[45:33] maxfactor to fix her cosmetic face no
[45:35] sir it was God the very blush of eternal
[45:40] life in her made her beautiful Allison
[45:45] two sisters listen one of us the very
[45:47] blush of eternal life don't you see what
[45:50] cosmetics try to do they try to replace
[45:54] the blush of eternal life that God
[45:57] placed and our sister sheets a nation
[46:00] now Eve was the perfect thought of a
[46:02] woman and there was something there that
[46:04] blush in her but it was not rude it was
[46:07] not something that was added but it was
[46:10] I said the blush or the newness or the
[46:13] use all glories to God of eternal life
[46:16] that was there so she never had to get
[46:18] up in the morning and block her eyes and
[46:20] paper cheeks and all that but as long as
[46:22] she was in harmony with the divine
[46:24] nature of God eternal life kept her
[46:28] looking young don't you realize that's
[46:30] what it's going to be when we get there
[46:32] that day it's going to be that blush of
[46:35] the eternal life that will enter back
[46:38] into every one of us you're not gonna
[46:40] need high rollers
[46:42] you're not gonna need to dye your hair
[46:45] not gonna need to put pink on your
[46:47] cheeks they'll be there naturally by
[46:49] channel life but when eternal life left
[46:52] their mortality come in and mortality
[46:56] took away the blush out of her cheeks
[46:59] but she wants that blush but she tries
[47:02] to replace it was cosmetics instead of
[47:05] the numerous oma notice now he says the
[47:11] very blush of eternal life in her made
[47:14] her beautiful praise God the right blush
[47:18] of eternal life in her made her
[47:20] beautiful she would never have to have
[47:22] manicures or anything like to do today
[47:25] sin is what brought you to that place so
[47:29] sin is what brought humanity to that
[47:33] place to whether they want to concede
[47:35] you sing don't want to lift her face and
[47:37] if their eyes lift their nose and if
[47:38] their net lift I want to be totally
[47:40] lifted I want a facelift I'm won the
[47:43] body lift my goodness you're magic if
[47:48] you could see past this foreign some
[47:50] people they look like a wrinkled raisin
[47:53] from here down then look like a drawn up
[47:55] raisin oh my goodness they're plastic
[47:58] surgery everything this visible the rest
[48:00] of looks like a big fat prune well I
[48:05] don't want a facelift I don't want a
[48:08] neck lift
[48:08] I don't want me I want me I will bloom
[48:14] of eternal use in my face again Eve was
[48:25] the most beautiful woman that was ever
[48:31] on the earth
[48:34] she was God's perfect salt of a woman
[48:39] and Adam was the most perfect man that
[48:42] lived and when he was made manifest in
[48:47] Christ proved it now when you get that
[48:53] statement figured out let me know what
[48:54] that means would you marry stood I see
[48:57] Adam gray big manly shoulders his big
[49:01] muscles his legs his shaggy hair hanging
[49:06] around his neck uh-huh I'm sorry y'all
[49:10] didn't know brother man said that shaggy
[49:14] I can see even remember brother bottom
[49:17] saw the dog Baker sent a quote a few
[49:26] minutes ago is over a Manilla preach and
[49:27] he sent a quote sister famous Benson Oh
[49:29] before I walked out and brother REM said
[49:31] I had something so strange to happen to
[49:33] me life's not a broken division and he
[49:36] said I've seen Adam walk out of the
[49:39] Garden of Eden
[49:40] and then I moved followed on in town and
[49:43] I saw Jesus walk out this is not
[49:48] imagination he saw this by vision oh ma
[49:56] I can see Eve beautiful long hair
[50:00] hanging down her back as a matter of
[50:03] fact he said it came down to her hips
[50:05] her eyes as the blue as the skies
[50:10] Sparkle lots of stars she didn't have to
[50:12] use maxfactor to make her pretty no no
[50:15] sir no sir
[50:16] sins what did that beloved brother she's
[50:19] made in God's image she was made after
[50:20] the image of man after God had created
[50:22] her beautiful never to die never to get
[50:25] old never to wrinkle the sparkle to
[50:27] never go out of her eyes she was to be
[50:29] beautiful forever
[50:32] neither one of Adams shoulders ever sag
[50:35] hour his hair turned gray any
[50:37] deterioration oh ma to him walking
[50:41] perfect with friendship and fellowship
[50:43] with the father where is your beloved he
[50:47] was in his gardener so the eternal one
[50:55] coming down fellowshipping was two of
[50:57] these kids that had access to eternal
[50:59] life the blush of youth
[51:02] let's just say for the story tonight
[51:04] they lived to be three four or five
[51:06] thousand years old however long it was
[51:08] or however long this in the Garden of
[51:09] Eden rather that they just kept on going
[51:11] and going and going in time we don't
[51:12] know exactly but they never aged one bit
[51:15] never got up for the creek in the back
[51:17] or a creek in the net or a toe ache or
[51:20] leg ache or growing pains or nor the
[51:22] kind of pains as far as that goes
[51:23] and that blush of eternal youth was
[51:26] always there that he said sand it in and
[51:29] God seen they had seen but before he
[51:31] could even pass judgment he had to go
[51:33] kill an innocent lamb or a beast and
[51:35] told the skins back there to cover up to
[51:39] make a substitutionary death provided
[51:41] for the worshiper to come to him and
[51:43] Adam and Eve standing in his presence oh
[51:46] god I can see the leave of them
[51:50] beautiful eyes now after sin had set in
[51:54] tears filled them and they run down her
[51:57] cheek I can see Adam of those strong
[51:59] eyes even as he looked across the
[52:02] evening and the soft winds have long her
[52:05] you had to make the beasts to obey Him
[52:06] and the lands and the way sure babe
[52:10] everything else I don't make me a full
[52:12] rulership over everything on there he
[52:14] realized it lost his fellowship with God
[52:22] tears are listen to his tears to show
[52:26] him that he was mortal now dripped off
[52:31] at his face ran down over his bosom and
[52:34] dripped off on Eve's head I can see her
[52:39] look up and said Adam I'm the cause of
[52:43] it dear
[52:49] I'm the cause
[52:55] first time he feels the shock of
[52:59] mortality it ties to his spirit it
[53:04] affects his flesh ties to his spirit
[53:07] because the image had left his soul so
[53:12] the oneness was God was broken the
[53:16] oneness was his wife was broken so now
[53:21] the tears the first time begin to come
[53:24] into his eyes and they drop down out of
[53:26] his eyes move down his cheeks and the
[53:29] panting she was a little bit shorter
[53:30] than him
[53:31] so her head was leaned over on his
[53:34] shoulder on his bosom let me like hear
[53:35] as they begin to fall off and drop onto
[53:38] her blonde hair which soon will be
[53:42] speckled with gray and her tears begin
[53:46] to drop off as well and she kind of
[53:48] looked up at him and said Adam I'm the
[53:52] cause of it dear y'all know I see Adam
[53:57] and Eve the first little sweethearts and
[53:59] the Garden of Eden
[54:01] I'll see Adam back down when he put his
[54:04] arms around this little sweetheart to
[54:07] walk out with her for God had condemned
[54:10] him and he started out with his arms
[54:14] around his darling Adam was not deceived
[54:17] he didn't have to walk out but he walked
[54:20] out because he loved his wife he walked
[54:25] out with both eyes wide open no matter
[54:28] listen to us if she had to go to torment
[54:33] he go
[54:35] wizard Marcus what love
[54:48] when God looked down and sing that love
[54:51] of a human being it was so great that he
[54:59] couldn't stand it
[55:02] it overwhelmed God when he seen a man
[55:07] would love his wife so much it
[55:11] overwhelmed God glory to God hallelujah
[55:21] it was so great that he couldn't stand
[55:24] it himself
[55:25] that's right he said oh come and go -
[55:32] you realize God lets the garden eat him
[55:37] well he didn't want to live in Paradise
[55:41] alone Adam if you can't be here at a
[55:45] paradise if you and Eve can't be you
[55:48] see your smile if I can't hear
[55:50] your life if I can hear you talk about a
[55:52] little baby paradise paradise without
[56:04] you so he said I'll come and go - and he
[56:19] said I'll put enmity between her seed
[56:21] and the serpent see notice he goes on to
[56:25] say I'm at San Dimas condemnable driven
[56:27] from the Garden of Eden by God see all
[56:30] of these three words the redemptive robe
[56:36] the redemptive robe over him showed that
[56:41] and the redemptive robust wot sheepskin
[56:47] Laura - God the redemptive robe on Adam
[56:53] showed he had fallen
[56:56] sojourner Sandlin we stand before him
[56:58] that day and the redemptive road is gone
[57:01] robe is taken from us it will show we
[57:04] have been fully been redeemed we will
[57:07] need no more blood that we'll need no
[57:09] mercy seat you will need no attorney in
[57:12] your place you'll need no intercessor
[57:14] why you've changed the redemptive Road
[57:17] for a goal of thought bodies but while
[57:21] we are here we need to be clothed in a
[57:25] redemptive robe aren't you glad for
[57:28] tonight well what I said that Adam's sin
[57:33] willfully C Eve was actually deceived
[57:36] but Adam was not deceived he
[57:39] deliberately sent deliberately sinned
[57:42] knowing what he was doing because of his
[57:45] wife he took position with his wife than
[57:49] they went before God the both of them
[57:51] was condemned
[57:53] notice how jumps from the Garden of Eden
[57:56] now to the Garden of Gethsemane and also
[57:59] to the garden where he died Jesus not
[58:04] ignorant of what he was doing came down
[58:06] and took his place with the center the
[58:11] church that he might redeem the church
[58:14] back to himself
[58:17] don't you see what this sets such a
[58:20] thing in god hates you see brother John
[58:23] why it's such such a thing with God that
[58:26] God was overwhelmed by this come from
[58:29] God himself God himself in order to make
[58:36] reconciliation must do exactly the same
[58:38] thing
[58:39] add another Garden of Eden chose to
[58:41] become a sailor rather than to remain a
[58:43] god Jesus Christ and the Garden of
[58:46] Gethsemane chose to become a sinner
[58:48] rather than to remain God ship so he
[58:52] forfeited his God ship forsaking all
[58:54] Phoenix 1962 that's what the Prophet
[58:56] said oh ma I love the way God used
[59:04] brother Branham in these ways I can see
[59:09] all that space which was God God had no
[59:13] beginning of days ending of years he's
[59:15] forever and ever I can see all that
[59:18] great space as it begins to move
[59:20] together like this coming down
[59:26] notice what shape it takes not a box not
[59:31] a triangle not a dumptruck
[59:38] funnel so if you've got a two gallon
[59:43] gallon of gas or kerosene or something
[59:46] and you're trying to pour it in a small
[59:48] tiny hole what you do you might need a
[59:50] funnel hey man what's he gonna do it's
[59:54] gonna funnel it down to bring it into
[59:58] the mouth that you desire to be here's
[1:00:00] all this great space here's all this
[1:00:02] great love here's all this great
[1:00:04] goodness of God and God Condon's sins
[1:00:07] I'm on an upside-down
[1:00:10] ramier God in the form of a funnel comes
[1:00:14] down to minister what the redemptive
[1:00:16] rope God coming down to a funnel shape
[1:00:24] like that and it moved down and he began
[1:00:27] to ah that little couple gone through
[1:00:31] the Garden of Eden bloody skins flop and
[1:00:33] against her leg he couldn't stand it
[1:00:39] that's my father he couldn't stand it
[1:00:43] and it moved on all it moved down to the
[1:00:46] very heart of God and spelled l.o.v.e
[1:00:53] God so loved he just couldn't listen
[1:00:57] this he just couldn't see them go he
[1:00:59] called him back sure he'd push the
[1:01:03] redemptive robe on he said now get out
[1:01:05] and don't come back
[1:01:11] what does they start out hitting their
[1:01:15] legs on both sides Buffett said what is
[1:01:18] that slapping I hear step bloody
[1:01:21] sheepskin hitting their legs as they go
[1:01:23] out and father looked at him mother Jim
[1:01:26] and so he comes down in front of him
[1:01:37] goes over and fallen on the form of this
[1:01:39] this pillar of fire this light this
[1:01:41] funnel and he comes right down and
[1:01:42] Fannie said stop I'll make you this
[1:01:48] promise I will bring you back where is
[1:02:00] your beloved goat he's in his garden
[1:02:06] doing only what he could do the act of
[1:02:10] the kinsman redeemer he couldn't see
[1:02:18] them go he called them back and said I'm
[1:02:19] gonna put enmity isn't it amazing that
[1:02:22] God didn't tell this to Adam then this
[1:02:26] amazing that God didn't say to the man
[1:02:28] now you're the man you're the head of
[1:02:29] the house and you're this and that and
[1:02:30] the other we believe all that do mean
[1:02:32] heart but God never said it to the man
[1:02:35] but unto the woman he said praise be to
[1:02:41] God
[1:02:42] so the church is gonna play part of
[1:02:44] redemption
[1:02:45] now his position is going to bring not
[1:02:50] only eating back but it's going to bring
[1:02:53] his elect eating back as well a man now
[1:03:00] I'm of course forfeiting his rights to
[1:03:02] eternal life the kinsman redeemer must
[1:03:05] come down and condemn sin and he must be
[1:03:08] able to bring it back in order to
[1:03:10] restore the divine nature in the hearts
[1:03:12] of the elect of God notice his son
[1:03:14] Solomon chapter 4 verse 12 a garden
[1:03:17] enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring
[1:03:20] shut up a fountain sealed I look at it
[1:03:22] will tell me here that God is going to
[1:03:24] bring the elight back into the state
[1:03:26] again the enclosed garden prophetically
[1:03:30] here he is speaking of his bride

[1:03:41] my floor she is now moved into the stage
[1:03:43] of reconciliation she has now been
[1:03:46] identified by the divine nature of God
[1:03:48] she's answering back what was prophecy

[1:03:54] is fulfilled Song of Solomon chapter 5
[1:03:58] verse 1 I'm coming into my garden my

[1:06:00] breaker hobbled our church he ain't got
[1:06:01] no way to bring revival to our church
[1:06:03] he's sent to the hands not Eagles well
[1:06:07] praise God we need this radio God we
[1:06:09] need this television God we don't need
[1:06:10] none
[1:06:11] that we've got our own land we've got
[1:06:13] our own inheritance we got our own men
[1:06:16] of God let's say understanding of what
[1:06:18] it takes to feed this bride come on now
[1:06:23] Jeremiah 31 12 therefore they shall come
[1:06:27] and sing in the height of Zion and shall
[1:06:30] flow together to the goodness of the
[1:06:32] Lord for wheat and for wine and for oil
[1:06:35] and for the young of the flock and of
[1:06:38] the herd and their soul shall be as a
[1:06:41] watered garden and they shall not sorrow
[1:06:45] any more at all
[1:06:49] praise God but how us these prophecies
[1:06:54] gonna come to pass the goal must go
[1:07:00] through another guard John 19 41 now in
[1:07:08] that place where he was crucified there
[1:07:15] was a and in the garden a new Sepulcher
[1:07:26] wherein was never man yet laid I wonder
[1:07:33] if they ever had a hard time keeping
[1:07:34] people in it after his and it wants the
[1:07:38] weirdest grave and the hold on the whole
[1:07:40] of the world every time they put people
[1:07:42] in they keep getting out they keep
[1:07:44] paying nobody man if he did you got your
[1:07:45] uncle dead you morning brought alive him
[1:07:47] bury him overboard Jesus was cuz nobody
[1:07:49] can stay in that grave now think of the
[1:07:53] place where he was crucified there was a
[1:07:59] garden glory be to God in the place he
[1:08:05] was crucified there was a garden and
[1:08:09] there was a garden tomb this is where
[1:08:12] the Songwriters and you hear the song of
[1:08:14] the garden tomb this is where they get
[1:08:16] it from this passage of scripture John
[1:08:18] being the only one who mentions this and
[1:08:20] this
[1:08:20] Jr touch honestly really sticks out to
[1:08:22] John and you think of it now that our
[1:08:25] kinsman redeemer he's going to be
[1:08:27] crucified or hallelujah crucified and
[1:08:31] he's going to come into a certain place
[1:08:33] and in there is going to be a garden
[1:08:37] what a peculiar place for a crucifixion
[1:08:43] but of course the Jewish rabbis say this
[1:08:52] is the same place
[1:08:53] Adam was buried but the place of the
[1:09:06] skull was more than just the place of
[1:09:08] the skull that they supposedly after his
[1:09:13] resurrection crucifixion found
[1:09:16] somebody's skull and the crack of the
[1:09:18] earth well I don't know about all that
[1:09:22] but I do know I was raised after he got
[1:09:26] up I may be legend and maybe this that
[1:09:31] the other I really don't know but I
[1:09:33] didn't know if we could ask John where
[1:09:38] is he at where's lettuce s Mary Mary
[1:09:50] where is he oh they killed him they
[1:09:56] crucified him I heard that but where is
[1:09:59] he he's in the garden where he should
[1:10:03] beloved so when Mary Magdalene goes down
[1:10:09] whenever she enters into that place that
[1:10:11] day where is she going
[1:10:13] in the garden glory be to God whenever
[1:10:18] she goes looking for her lord what's she
[1:10:20] gone by the Scott's she's going in the
[1:10:23] garden where he
[1:10:25] beloved he's in the garden let me tell
[1:10:30] you tonight my friends the fullness of
[1:10:31] his powers not in me but if you want to
[1:10:33] know where a portion of him is I'll tell
[1:10:36] you where he's at tonight he's in his
[1:10:38] garden I no longer can say well he was
[1:10:41] in brother Branham years ago he was in
[1:10:42] Paul he was in John if you want to know
[1:10:45] where he's at tonight at least a part of
[1:10:46] him I can tell you where is that he is
[1:10:49] in his garden praise be to God now in
[1:10:56] the place where he was crucified there
[1:10:59] was a garden and in the garden a new
[1:11:04] Sepulcher his resurrection from this
[1:11:09] garden would secure the complete
[1:11:11] restoration of all that was lost and
[1:11:19] where does it happen in the garden
[1:11:23] so Adam enters into a spiritual tomb
[1:11:27] death and the day you eat thereof that
[1:11:30] day you will die no doubt it started
[1:11:33] that day something moved in him brother
[1:11:35] Terry he felt different he thought
[1:11:37] differently look differently at
[1:11:39] different Adam in turned into a garden
[1:11:42] tomb a tomb of his own making so here's
[1:11:47] the second Adam
[1:11:48] they don't crucify him over in some
[1:11:50] synagogues somewhere they don't crucify
[1:11:52] me on this place or that place but where
[1:11:54] did they pick to crucify in a garden and
[1:11:57] there is an empty tomb there that ain't
[1:12:00] just coincidence it's perfect setting
[1:12:03] for his resurrection and for yours
[1:12:06] it is a two-fold restoration in that he
[1:12:10] will bring Eden back and he will also
[1:12:13] raise his garden bride Lorie be to God
[1:12:18] notice she goes on to say in chapter 2
[1:12:20] verse after 6 verse 2 my beloved has
[1:12:23] gone down
[1:12:24] the act of condescension now my beloved
[1:12:27] he is gone down into his garden over and
[1:12:31] over again she mentions this and of
[1:12:33] course it was in the natural sense the
[1:12:35] parallel of Solomon's that I mentioned
[1:12:37] to you that Josephus says that he had a
[1:12:38] garden which is about two miles in a
[1:12:40] place called FM e th a.m. about two
[1:12:43] miles from Jerusalem every morning
[1:12:45] Solomon would go down with great pomp
[1:12:47] and he would condense and and descend
[1:12:50] from Mount Zion which was the City of
[1:12:52] David he would come on that side of the
[1:12:54] city and they would come down with great
[1:12:56] pomp and go down into the garden and
[1:12:58] they would go down every day down in
[1:13:01] descend into the garden and then after
[1:13:05] his descending into the garden he would
[1:13:07] bring the fruits of the garden and he
[1:13:10] would have sinned in the captivity
[1:13:11] captive and banned gifts unto men so he
[1:13:14] would come up from the garden
[1:13:16] he will bring fruits and nuts and
[1:13:19] flowers and gifts and he would actually
[1:13:22] drop them along the way to the people as
[1:13:25] he's going back to Jerusalem when I Lord
[1:13:28] Jesus went down into hell and he knocked
[1:13:31] on the door took the keys away from the
[1:13:33] devil he emptied out paradise and he
[1:13:36] ascended on how and what did he do he
[1:13:39] gave gifts under me his apostles
[1:13:41] prophets his teachers his pastors it was
[1:13:46] the fruit of his garden my beloved has
[1:13:57] gone down into his garden to the beds of
[1:14:03] spices now she knows where his
[1:14:09] unidentified presence is and now she can
[1:14:13] call it the identified presence of God
[1:14:19] she's no longer where here is God it's
[1:14:22] God among us where is he now she can say
[1:14:25] I know Ray's that he is here hallelujah
[1:14:35] the Solomon in the natural parallel
[1:14:38] certainly took great delight in gardens
[1:14:41] and trees notice in Cleese yesyes
[1:14:42] chapter 2 verse 4 he says I made me
[1:14:45] great works i builded me houses i
[1:14:49] planted me vineyards i made me gardens
[1:14:53] and orchards and i planted trees in them
[1:14:56] of all kinds of fruit i made me pools of
[1:15:02] water to water that was the word that
[1:15:04] bringeth forth trees now notice this is
[1:15:08] solomon and the natural that solomon
[1:15:12] made him david didn't make him for it
[1:15:14] his mama didn't make him for him Mary
[1:15:18] didn't make this Bradford Jesus Mary
[1:15:21] does play no part in redemption there
[1:15:25] ain't another God in heaven that's an
[1:15:26] old man that played the part in this
[1:15:28] Redemption this is the mighty God
[1:15:30] himself there ain't two and 33 there is
[1:15:33] why he made the bride he made the church
[1:15:37] he made the hundred forty-four thousand
[1:15:39] he made the Holy Ghost he made preachers
[1:15:42] he made singing he may be anointing I
[1:15:46] made me gardens I made me pools I made
[1:15:50] me tree I made me fruit I made up he's
[1:15:56] the one who does o my notice what she
[1:16:00] says my beloved has gone down into his
[1:16:03] garden to the beds of spices their
[1:16:07] difference plants now with all the
[1:16:10] fragrances of time and cinnamon and the
[1:16:16] Sakuma and all these different things
[1:16:19] when you would walk in out our garden is
[1:16:21] not like a field finally some of them
[1:16:24] have already went out start paddling
[1:16:26] they'll put soybeans or corn or whatever
[1:16:29] more they may have to dis come up and
[1:16:31] plowed and get it read an issue they may
[1:16:33] pile but a couple more times
[1:16:35] for the most part Mitchell they leave it
[1:16:38] you can't do a garden with it a garden
[1:16:41] requires constant pruning
[1:16:45] cleaning whipping I mean picking up
[1:16:48] stuff you ought to be so happy to god
[1:16:53] that every time you come to church you
[1:16:55] get preached on it proves you're a
[1:16:58] guardian and not to feel effusive feel
[1:17:04] you would not to get no correction you
[1:17:06] learn how to get nothing that big hunka
[1:17:08] burning up all around you ever unites
[1:17:10] with corn and soybeans and they reach
[1:17:12] the end of their cycle they get so big
[1:17:13] you can no longer go in there and plow
[1:17:15] because you'll break them all down so
[1:17:17] what do you do you leave the cocoa birds
[1:17:19] in the church now I mean in the field so
[1:17:21] you leave the briars and the nettles and
[1:17:23] the thorns and the thistles you just go
[1:17:24] ahead and leave them there and then you
[1:17:26] divide them at the white throne judgment
[1:17:28] but if you are a garden you've got pads
[1:17:32] you've got ways in you've got ways out
[1:17:34] and you can go in and trim this off and
[1:17:37] cut that back and fertilize this and you
[1:17:39] can attend to every plant every Bush
[1:17:42] every every little flower because you
[1:17:45] allocated enough space in your garden
[1:17:47] for it I'm so glad I'm a garden aren't
[1:18:00] you glad your garden not just a big old
[1:18:03] soybean patch we're just so the sink
[1:18:08] don't you understand that's what these
[1:18:10] little sin purchased or do it that's why
[1:18:13] they don't get in people's lives and
[1:18:14] dealing they don't do this and you
[1:18:15] better not do that you know no no no no
[1:18:18] they're just soybean Christians we're
[1:18:21] just going Christian so they just saw it
[1:18:23] and that porn preacher stands up and he
[1:18:24] just so well I ain't got time to deal
[1:18:26] with clothes on religion I don't please
[1:18:28] or clothes on religion you're not
[1:18:29] preaching the gospel
[1:18:30] [Applause]
[1:18:34] but if you're a garden so over on the
[1:18:41] shady side you've got this Japanese
[1:18:42] maple you've got this green Laurel P
[1:18:46] then you've got the variegated one every
[1:18:48] third that you like to alternate you've
[1:18:51] got japonica you've got whatever more
[1:18:53] and you picked it according to the
[1:18:55] filtration of the light that would come
[1:18:58] down through it because you know if you
[1:18:59] take this shady area and you put a full
[1:19:02] Sun plant more than likely it will not
[1:19:04] bloom right if it blooms at all now in
[1:19:07] my grow and in my live but more than
[1:19:10] likely it will not bloom without the
[1:19:12] right amount of son of man tan take so
[1:19:19] much Sun to be able to make her grow and
[1:19:20] ripen praise the Lord
[1:19:23] so you got to be very picky and then
[1:19:25] you've got a little water aspect over
[1:19:27] here and then you've got this over there
[1:19:28] and that over that but you want to leave
[1:19:30] enough room to be able to get in around
[1:19:31] us so you go in and be able to pull this
[1:19:32] up and then we'll took her up around
[1:19:34] this a little bit nip that often cut
[1:19:36] this oh oh it's a big job it's a lot of
[1:19:39] work I mean God's been working on this
[1:19:41] for thousands of years now but you want
[1:19:45] to plow fields this coil our disc adept
[1:19:47] so you seed and go back to house God's
[1:19:52] making can we go on notice this now she
[1:20:00] says my beloved is going down into his
[1:20:04] garden to the bed of spices to feed to
[1:20:09] feed in the gardens to feed so Jesus
[1:20:17] Christ has come in this place tonight
[1:20:21] to feed in the individual garden hearts
[1:20:26] he's come to feed what are you gonna
[1:20:30] feed him the fellow him is here and he's
[1:20:37] come to feed what if you got for him now
[1:20:42] remember supplied that ministers to her
[1:20:44] husband right so what are we going to
[1:20:48] feed him building programs Democrats
[1:20:53] Republicans independents Trump's Obama's
[1:20:57] Clinton's I get sick of hearing all that
[1:20:58] mess aren't you glad we're going to a
[1:21:01] kingdom where there is no such trash and
[1:21:03] nonsense of politics so he enters into
[1:21:08] this place of his paradise and he's not
[1:21:13] just got flowers which are for
[1:21:15] observation he doesn't just have a
[1:21:17] difference plants which are there for
[1:21:19] many of them to bill but many of them
[1:21:20] are edible
[1:21:22] they are edible in verse three I am My
[1:21:33] Beloved's and my beloved his mind and
[1:21:42] again she says it he feedeth among the
[1:21:46] lilies never remember this is a
[1:21:48] restoration after he's knocked on the
[1:21:50] door and she delayed to come this is the
[1:21:53] restoration this is scene five when
[1:21:55] action this part of the drama to word
[1:21:57] that has now been restored and she's
[1:21:59] nervous herself anxious what's this
[1:22:01] response gonna be how is he going to do
[1:22:03] because Allison want to make the mistake
[1:22:05] I was the one it was slow I was the one
[1:22:07] who laid back on him what is he going to
[1:22:09] do to me but somehow she's got the
[1:22:13] revelation I am still my beloved
[1:22:18] the separation has now ended praise God
[1:22:24] his love for me remains as strong now as
[1:22:28] it did before I messed up praise God
[1:22:33] his communion between him and her what's
[1:22:36] in chapter 2 verse 16 she says a very
[1:22:41] similar thing my beloved is mine and I
[1:22:46] am his and he feedeth among the lilies
[1:22:50] but you notice as she grows on and
[1:22:52] matures she reverses it and her
[1:22:55] stability and strength is now evident by
[1:22:58] the way she's rewarding at saying
[1:22:59] exactly the same words but it's the
[1:23:02] order before she was placing it upon her
[1:23:05] love and her faithfulness how wonderful
[1:23:07] she was and how great she was but now
[1:23:12] she's got it in the right order I am My
[1:23:15] Beloved's and he is mine so it's not all
[1:23:20] about me and I got rid of all that free
[1:23:21] moral agency from Free Will Baptist
[1:23:22] stuff and all that sort of thing I
[1:23:24] sought God now sought God and I found
[1:23:27] out he grabbed ahold of my horns and
[1:23:28] pulled me to the altar with me actually
[1:23:29] doing it no way now what does he want he
[1:23:33] wants fellowship but it must be
[1:23:35] fellowship on his own divine command it
[1:23:38] must not be by us dictate well I think
[1:23:40] it'll be this one that way notice this
[1:23:42] little bit says he's risen from the dead
[1:23:45] he lives among us today and he wants
[1:23:47] fellowship back with his people again
[1:23:50] his great Majesty all night listen to
[1:23:54] this I love this his great Majesty his
[1:23:56] glory is now spreading forth
[1:23:58] he's desiring the fellowship again with
[1:24:01] his people like he did in the Garden of
[1:24:04] Eden again he says God longs for
[1:24:09] fellowship he yearns
[1:24:12] can you imagine Almighty God yearning
[1:24:15] for something and longing he yearns he
[1:24:19] wants people this is what he wants from
[1:24:22] you brother nd he wants people to speak
[1:24:27] with him
[1:24:31] to talk with him you sucking do this you
[1:24:38] can't do it God wants us to speak to
[1:24:44] another and talk to him it's not like
[1:24:49] some great deep theologian the standing
[1:24:52] up in all my all the villages get it
[1:24:54] this can bring a downward child can do
[1:24:56] it
[1:24:57] do you understand God wants our children
[1:25:01] to be able to fellowship with him this
[1:25:03] way not on the terms of a theologian
[1:25:06] that stands up and talks about the seals
[1:25:08] and the thunders and this and that and
[1:25:10] the other and goes over the tops of many
[1:25:11] people's heads but being able to instill
[1:25:14] in our children talk to him when you're
[1:25:15] little talk to him when you're little
[1:25:17] and be able to understand he wants to
[1:25:20] hear from you oh my lord I believe now
[1:25:29] that you are Jesus Christ the Son of God
[1:25:31] what's this by the Wrentham talking
[1:25:33] about how person gets saved and how they
[1:25:35] come to God I believe now that you're
[1:25:37] Jesus Christ the Son of God I recognize
[1:25:39] his blood went before me the Holy Spirit
[1:25:42] comes down and a miraculous power
[1:25:44] transforms your life picks you up and
[1:25:48] brings you into the inside of the veil
[1:25:53] speak the God the Holy Ghost transforms
[1:25:57] you picks you up brings you inside the
[1:26:00] veil and sets you down and thunder you
[1:26:04] have fellowship with God and commune
[1:26:07] with him as Adam did in the beginning in
[1:26:10] the Garden of Eden but brother don't
[1:26:14] have still got my mortal body I know
[1:26:15] friends and that's what keeps us from
[1:26:17] seeing the truth other the devil don't
[1:26:19] want us to see an element of this
[1:26:22] spiritual communion has been restored
[1:26:24] because of what Jesus done you're
[1:26:26] thinking it's going to come out your
[1:26:28] wallet oh my light so how much of it is
[1:26:30] already here
[1:26:31] [Applause]
[1:26:36] praise God the Holy Ghost picks you up
[1:26:39] transforms you and set you on the other
[1:26:42] side of the veil said now don't do me
[1:26:47] tell me you love me tell me how do you
[1:26:50] feel tell me how grateful y'all talk to
[1:26:53] me I want to hear ya I love this in
[1:27:02] Christ a mystery when he come on the
[1:27:04] earth he was the Tree of Life do you
[1:27:07] believe that in Rome what did they do he
[1:27:11] had to be chopped down and he was put on
[1:27:14] a tree of disgrace cursed is he that
[1:27:19] hang on the tree become a curse for the
[1:27:21] human race and now through that he
[1:27:25] brings forth a bride tree so here comes
[1:27:28] the son of man tree on the earth he
[1:27:32] gives his life and dies on a Roman tree
[1:27:34] by dying on the Roman tree it releases a
[1:27:38] broad tree from his body who but God
[1:27:42] could do such a plan the devil only saw
[1:27:48] him or hit a note is gonna set me free
[1:27:51] hit or never done what he done there
[1:27:53] ain't no way in the world can you
[1:27:54] imagine I imagine he got madder than a
[1:27:56] Hornet at himself and every demon that
[1:27:58] he had when he realized he was a very
[1:28:00] warm the very war now that actually
[1:28:03] helped God carry out his plan of
[1:28:05] redemption can you imagine when Jesus
[1:28:07] showed up down inhale hallelujah
[1:28:09] the Prophet said from the time that God
[1:28:11] said I promise you I'll give you a
[1:28:13] redeemer he said when Abel was born he
[1:28:16] thought that was him when Moses was born
[1:28:18] he thought that was him when shall I
[1:28:20] come he thought that was him
[1:28:22] but when he died and went down into hell
[1:28:23] and he kicked the door of hell Amla said
[1:28:26] I have arrived he said I thought I got
[1:28:29] you when I got Abel I thought I got you
[1:28:31] then I got Moses and he said yeah my
[1:28:34] blood is still hot on Calvary give me
[1:28:36] the keys hallelujah to God he reached
[1:28:39] over and grabbed the keys off of the
[1:28:41] devil side the Prophet said he kicked
[1:28:43] the door of hell shut shook everything
[1:28:46] off the walls and he sort of send it up
[1:28:48] on high with Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:29:01] so here hangs the tree of love on a
[1:29:05] Roman tree giving birth to a broad tree
[1:29:15] so they took the tree of life down from
[1:29:18] the Roman tree laid The Tree of Life
[1:29:22] where in the garden of course in a
[1:29:32] garden they weep and they cry and they
[1:29:41] Shep the stone back because the Sabbath
[1:29:45] is coming on but he had a promise he
[1:29:52] didn't have 1100 tapes like you and I've
[1:29:54] got but David had prophesied and said
[1:29:57] I'll not leave my holy one of hell or
[1:29:58] suffer my Holy One to see corruption you
[1:30:01] imagine with one promise he could look
[1:30:03] death in the face and say you won't be
[1:30:05] able to hold my pass this time
[1:30:07] [Applause]
[1:30:14] hallelujah when they come to anoint the
[1:30:20] tree and make the tree smell that and
[1:30:25] take away the stench from the tree I
[1:30:28] found the tree was gone
[1:30:34] he didn't need but three days to
[1:30:36] germinate and get back up again oh they
[1:30:46] say whenever the Eastern customers when
[1:30:48] a man was calling away from his supper
[1:30:50] table one of the ways that his servants
[1:30:54] knew he was not done eating was by the
[1:30:56] way he folded his napkin if he folded
[1:31:01] his napkin a certain way they knew he
[1:31:04] was coming back but if he folded it in
[1:31:07] another way they knew he was done didn't
[1:31:10] it amazing that when the scripture
[1:31:12] begins to talk about Jesus raising from
[1:31:14] the dead that it mentions that he'd
[1:31:16] folded his napkin you know he won one of
[1:31:33] these days are all mortal bodies it's
[1:31:36] gonna fall like a napkin
[1:31:39] and will say we are God with mortality
[1:31:44] hallelu it will be folded so the Tree of
[1:31:56] Life
[1:31:57] hanging on a Roman tree and then they
[1:32:00] bury the tree and in three days
[1:32:03] I can't find him where's the trigger the
[1:32:13] Prophet said through that he brings
[1:32:16] forth a bride tree which will be the
[1:32:21] Tree of Life restored back to him as
[1:32:26] husband and wife
[1:32:29] in the Garden of Eden we saw big I mean
[1:32:36] you get done with this series of the
[1:32:37] Song of Solomon
[1:32:38] we never go me down with this series in
[1:32:40] the Song of Solomon we're still gonna be
[1:32:42] acting this out and eternity the Song of
[1:32:45] Solomon is going to keep right on living
[1:32:47] we're gonna say where's he at summers
[1:32:48] gonna say he said his garden garden but

[1:38:38] you're overlooking signs of the garden
[1:38:40] right in your very soul don't you
[1:38:43] understand what a meticulous caretaker
[1:38:46] you have in the garden of your life
[1:38:50] other people even people around the
[1:38:52] message they can live in your way and do
[1:38:54] any other thing and say they're going in
[1:38:56] the rapture there this said the other
[1:38:57] don't you pattern your life but them
[1:38:59] cornfield people don't you pattern your
[1:39:02] life by then bunch of cocklebur people
[1:39:04] you're a garden a garden each plan is
[1:39:07] individual it must be grabbed around it
[1:39:09] must be fertilized it must be dealt with
[1:39:11] individually or table to take your
[1:39:14] lifetime but when he gets down with you
[1:39:17] by the way it'll be a paradise
[1:39:20] a paradise of a garden he spare heads

[1:39:44] as tirzah as tearsa comely as Jerusalem
[1:39:54] Amen how her heart must enter into
[1:39:58] rapture knowing that she's forgiven of
[1:40:01] her complacency and he looks at her as
[1:40:06] the crowning points of his kingdom tears
[1:40:11] oh and Jerusalem praise God Heavenly
[1:40:18] Father we bow our plant heads to the
[1:40:25] dust of the earth Lord were not
[1:40:29] interested so much in producing
[1:40:33] thousands and thousands of bushels as it
[1:40:35] were no wheat farmer will plough or
[1:40:40] maybe doesn't even plow I use his
[1:40:42] no-till and he wants as much out of a
[1:40:45] quarter as he can get or he wants as
[1:40:48] much productivity so sprays and does
[1:40:50] everything that he can because it's all
[1:40:52] about numbers bushels and bushels and
[1:40:56] more bushels Lord we're not counting
[1:40:59] numbers tonight you don't count your
[1:41:02] crowds you weigh yours the Lord's are
[1:41:06] not interested in getting the biggest
[1:41:08] following you're interested in quality
[1:41:11] character gardens for the most part will
[1:41:16] always be smaller than a hay field or a
[1:41:20] wheat field or a corn field because you
[1:41:25] just can't take care of it if it was 640
[1:41:29] acres you'd have to have full-time
[1:41:31] gardeners many of them
[1:41:33] so many gardens will be so small I
[1:41:35] remember years ago and Carolyn I used to
[1:41:38] go through England and we'd stopped by
[1:41:41] brother and sister wilkinson's house and
[1:41:42] would fly into Heathrow Airport and then
[1:41:46] that morning and fly out of Gatwick that
[1:41:49] nine going to Zimbabwe or Kenya so would
[1:41:51] have an all-day layover and be the 80
[1:41:54] would come and get us and take us to
[1:41:56] their little home would sleep for a
[1:41:58] while and then they get together some of
[1:42:00] the Saints together and would fellowship
[1:42:01] together and have a meal together and
[1:42:03] then take us back to the airport to
[1:42:05] fight around midnight or so and sister
[1:42:09] Margaret had it just a little wee place
[1:42:12] there in Sussex but she always wanted to
[1:42:15] show him me and Carol or a little garden
[1:42:17] it was small but she liked fiddle with
[1:42:21] it the Lord after brother Eddie passed
[1:42:27] she lived about a month or so and then
[1:42:30] she was gone too so now they're over
[1:42:34] there were it's all kinds of space so
[1:42:39] her little wee garden took a lot of time
[1:42:42] because each plant was so special to her
[1:42:46] each one nard this someone from Canada
[1:42:50] gave him Carolyn asked some flowers a
[1:42:53] couple of years ago from the garden of
[1:42:55] the famous artist himself Monet so it
[1:43:00] was quite something for us to have some
[1:43:02] of the seeds from his garden but Lord
[1:43:08] God I'm so glad that you dropped one of
[1:43:13] your seeds
[1:43:16] it's not from Monday it's not from
[1:43:20] Botanical Gardens in Asheville or
[1:43:22] Houston but is from the very mind of God
[1:43:27] praise the Lord because of mine
[1:43:32] differences in my scars as a human being
[1:43:34] and my frailty my dirt has allowed a lot
[1:43:38] of things to grow up around these plants
[1:43:41] but you're such a patient gardener Lord
[1:43:45] I pray you'd help each of us and
[1:43:46] highfather we can still say you're still
[1:43:51] working on me we're willing to say too
[1:43:54] not Lord we need more work we need more
[1:43:58] help well we know what you won't give up
[1:44:01] on one of your gardens help us operate
[1:44:07] to my father and many erase your hand
[1:44:10] with me and say Lord be mindful of me
[1:44:13] work on me Lord trim me shape me Lord I
[1:44:19] don't want to be a big old cornfield or
[1:44:21] a big old soybean field with everything
[1:44:22] in the world and my plants may be a lot
[1:44:26] smaller and there may not be near as
[1:44:28] many of them but they may be exotic and
[1:44:31] rare and delicate and they require
[1:44:33] special attention the harvest want me
[1:44:36] near as much it won't be no thousands of
[1:44:39] bushels as it were might just be one
[1:44:41] tree of this and one of that and one of
[1:44:43] another but when they're finished you
[1:44:46] will be able to see the Master Gardener
[1:44:48] worked in my life it'll be amazing when
[1:44:51] we all gathered there that day and we
[1:44:53] said at that table thousands of miles
[1:44:54] long how to walk the Master Gardener and
[1:44:58] they'll sleep Daryl said Paul the garden
[1:45:00] Peter the garden by the Wrentham the
[1:45:01] garden all those saints down through the
[1:45:04] ages and there are we'll set Lord little
[1:45:06] small people that men do nothing like
[1:45:08] what they don't but it'll be the same
[1:45:10] touch of the master that raised Moses
[1:45:14] the same one who raised Ezekiel and
[1:45:16] Jeremiah it'll be a same artistry of his
[1:45:20] work that's raised his plants in

[1:45:32] name tonight Lord God we raise our
[1:45:35] branches as it were up into the presence
[1:45:39] of the king

[1:45:48] your presence and worship your name o
[1:45:52] Lord God we worship you tonight father
[1:45:56] we're still clothed in that redemptive
[1:45:59] robe but how we long for the day when
[1:46:02] the robe will be taken away when you
[1:46:04] change your garments as high priest
[1:46:06] we'll take off our redemptive robe
[1:46:09] because we won't need it no more if you
[1:46:12] ain't a priest no longer
[1:46:14] we don't need blood no more to speak for
[1:46:16] us then we'll be able to speak face to
[1:46:19] face lip to ear the restoration will it
[1:46:25] fully arrive to our bodies oh thank you

[1:46:44] story of God the story of redemption not
[1:46:48] only what he's done but what he's doing
[1:46:51] he's completing the final chapters or
[1:46:53] they say the final verses in the final
[1:46:57] chapter it's been written about us a man
[1:47:02] it's closing out of the Gentiles history
[1:47:07] praise be to God we worship you tonight
