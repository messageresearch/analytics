TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and you know I would say that it would be a universal cry in this building tonight if I was just to ask for a show of hands to say who here wants to be like Jesus I'm sure all of us would raise our hand and say I want to be like Jesus I want to be like the Lord and his nature in his character then let's find out what produced this man as we know the prophet of God says character is not a gift but it's a victory oh don't let that become a cheap statement to you it has value to me character is not a gift it's not something that somebody hands you or just falls on your lap someday but character is a victory and victory doesn't come without a struggle and victory doesn't come without a fight oh I tell you what I dare you to show me a man of God whose anointed with the Spirit of God who desires righteousness in his life that is trouble free worry free pressure free you won't find one but you'll find a man of God who's used to Fiery Furnaces you'll find a woman of God who's used to lonely nights in prayer you'll find a son of God who's used to the Lions Den he's used to struggle he's just a torment because that's the way God chose the path of suffering they could not strange when fiery trials are to try you knowing that the trial of your faith is much more precious than that of gold oh but it's so hard sometimes to have come this route of suffering what was it that formed the pressure of this man what what was it about this man in this garden of gethsemane as we see Jesus who was the son of God and Gethsemane here and he had spent his entire life and mission his entire purpose his entire calling his destiny was leading him to this moment of Gethsemane his destiny was urging him and pulling him history and prophecy was pushing and anointing and urging this great climb actually say what was the climax was it a kingdom was it money wasn't popularity was it fame or fortune no it was a cross on a hill far away it was Calvary it was a it was a path of death to his own will as I know I've we preached it here before what was the victory that Christ endured it was the victory over his own human will with the plan of God for his life it was when he could say as the Bible says he even asked twice Lord if it's at all possible let this cup pass from me if it's at all his humanity said if it's even possible Lord God if there's any other way if there's any other way let it pass for me what was it it was the battle over his own will and this is where the victory or the defeat is won tonight is on your own human mind as you struggle and you struggle with the plan of God and you struggle with the calling of God in your life and many many people let me say this here tonight are serving God they love the Lord they come to church but they are not in the plan of God and the purpose for God for their life because many times they know that's a path of sorrow sometimes a path of torment a path of of suffering but we all say we want to be like Jesus but do we want to come Jesus his way as he says how I learned obedience by the things I suffered
