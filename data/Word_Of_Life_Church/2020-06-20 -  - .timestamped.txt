[29:15] [Music]
[29:21] Thank You Lord be blessed tonight as you
[29:24] listen to the word of the Lord praise
[29:35] the Lord for the valleys and the
[29:37] mountains and all the different things
[29:39] that come our way as children of God for
[29:44] those of you that are streaming tonight
[29:45] you haven't heard feel the folks sure if
[29:48] the church got sick with the kovat and
[29:52] we're going to be kind of reverting back
[29:55] to this or maybe maybe a couple of weeks
[29:59] we want to try to watch over those who
[30:03] haven't got it and hopefully we can keep
[30:06] them from it by the help of the Lord but
[30:09] we will certainly do our best I think
[30:12] that during during this time we'll
[30:16] probably go ahead and have Wednesday
[30:18] night Saturday night and Sunday morning
[30:21] and instead of just doing the two we
[30:24] probably need three right now I don't
[30:26] know we might need five or six services
[30:28] right now but everything that's going on
[30:30] but we'll try out three and then see how
[30:32] that goes so service will be normal time
[30:35] and when we have in it three times a
[30:38] week so we'll probably just be streaming
[30:40] for the next couple of weeks we're
[30:41] shooting for hopefully by the grace of
[30:42] the Lord maybe run the 1st of July 1
[30:46] we'll be able to gather back together
[30:47] after these that have been tested
[30:51] positive and those that they've been
[30:53] around and we have to give them a little
[30:54] bit of time for this Saint attendant
[30:57] kind of run its course well we certainly
[30:59] appreciate your prayers and trust that
[31:00] you'll enjoy the services and it's not
[31:04] the same of course if y'all not being
[31:05] here and it's not the same with you not
[31:07] being here I know that but I'm grateful
[31:09] that we have this under the difficult
[31:11] time that we have would like to read
[31:13] again tonight from 2nd Corinthians
[31:16] chapter 12 verse 9 and word I really
[31:20] didn't know whenever I was preaching on
[31:23] Sunday that we would be tested and tried
[31:27] but what we was probably was hearing
[31:29] Monday whenever I begin to hear about
[31:31] the different folks that had got sick
[31:33] and different ones that wasn't feeling
[31:35] very well I actually got sick myself I
[31:38] just got so physically sick and I just
[31:40] felt I felt awful just thinking that was
[31:43] going to have to cancel Church again I
[31:45] know I'm weird I'm strange but I love to
[31:48] go to church God saved me to go to the
[31:50] house of God I know some of you folks
[31:52] think streaming it's the same thing
[31:54] well the Bible don't agree with you the
[31:56] Bible says forsake not the assembling of
[31:58] yourselves together and there's
[31:59] something about being the house of God
[32:02] and I'll take him I just it just really
[32:05] been weighing heavy on me in the last
[32:07] couple three days and all this so we
[32:10] just trusted everybody will come through
[32:12] it and there'll be no lasting lasting
[32:14] results that'll be there and so the rest
[32:18] of you just be mindful of us in prayer
[32:19] if you would let's read a great paradox
[32:23] 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 and
[32:26] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[32:28] for thee for my strength is made perfect
[32:32] in weakness most gladly therefore will I
[32:37] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[32:41] power of Christ may rest upon me let me
[32:46] read that again and he said unto me my
[32:48] grace is sufficient for thee now we know
[32:52] that he could just as easily said it'll
[32:54] be gone tomorrow or in three days from
[32:57] now it'll be gone but instead of saying
[32:59] that he said my grace is sufficient so
[33:02] we know whenever he says that there's a
[33:04] divine reason for my strength is made
[33:08] perfect in weakness most gladly
[33:10] therefore will I rather glory and my
[33:13] infirmities that the power of Christ may
[33:17] rest upon me therefore I take pleasure
[33:20] and infirmities and reproaches in
[33:24] necessities in persecutions we all say
[33:28] god help us and de-stresses for Christ's
[33:32] sake
[33:33] for when I am weak then am i strong let
[33:40] us bow our heads together I just got an
[33:42] update just before I came out a few
[33:44] moments ago on brother Wade and
[33:47] mr. Waite said that he was doing pretty
[33:48] good except for his ability to swallow
[33:51] him just real difficult for him to
[33:52] swallow so let's remember him if it we
[33:54] can Heavenly Father we counted such an
[33:57] honor Lord Jesus that we can be gathered
[34:00] together here again of God we realize on
[34:04] Wednesday night some are gathered around
[34:06] the bar room and some are gathered
[34:09] Heavenly Father in the gambling dens and
[34:11] some are gathered in all types of wicked
[34:14] places but Lord Jesus we thank you that
[34:17] we can be gathered around the reveal
[34:20] word of this hour as we see the darkness
[34:23] as it's pressing its way closer and
[34:26] closer and closer yet makes us
[34:28] appreciate the light of God more than
[34:31] ever before we've said it all along
[34:35] that we need you but Lord God that is
[34:39] becoming more evident every day that
[34:42] live we live in this world the people
[34:45] around us are going insane they don't
[34:50] know what's right they don't know what's
[34:51] wrong
[34:52] Lord we would have never thought our
[34:54] nation would be paralyzed by a virus and
[34:57] never thought there's some of the things

[35:54] we love you about all of our hearts for
[35:56] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[35:58] ask
[35:59] amen god bless you brothers you may be
[36:02] seated
[36:03] certainly appreciate the brothers coming
[36:06] and helping us tonight
[36:07] the musicians and Deacon brothers
[36:10] brother Louie the song leader it's a
[36:12] blessing to us to be able to to know a
[36:15] symbol like this even though we're just
[36:17] a handful and been able to meet in the
[36:19] presence of God but we know the Lord
[36:21] Jesus whenever he came he didn't tell us
[36:24] that have to be a building full it's
[36:26] starting to be hurtin if it was many
[36:27] many times what we're so grateful that
[36:29] he promised that he would be with us in
[36:31] our great hour of need we want to pick
[36:34] up again tonight if the Lord would help
[36:36] us and been looking at this on the
[36:38] canosa of our Lord in the greatness of
[36:41] the manifestation of God and how it was
[36:44] revealed in such simplicity and such
[36:48] weakness and and our nature the way that
[36:51] we as humans look at it we don't like
[36:53] weakness we're afraid of it really it
[36:57] kind to brings out something about our
[37:00] nature and it shows us our inferiority
[37:03] z' and it displays something about us
[37:06] that we really don't want people to know
[37:08] and that is when we get apprehensive and
[37:12] we get afraid whenever we become weary
[37:15] of things and we tend to hide an element
[37:19] of our fears and an element of our
[37:22] weaknesses and we want to kind of put on
[37:25] a little bit of a front very few people
[37:28] probably ever really convey the depth of
[37:32] how they feel and yet the Lord Jesus
[37:34] knew that in order to be able to cover
[37:38] us as being a faithful high priest that
[37:41] would be touched by the feelings of our
[37:44] infirmities that he must go beyond the
[37:47] facade of what most humans would do even
[37:51] after they received the new birth he
[37:53] must go beyond what would ever be
[37:56] displayed by the strongest and by the
[37:59] weakest of Christians he must go to the
[38:02] very place that he would not only feel
[38:05] so vulnerable but he but also looks so
[38:09] vulnerable so we
[38:11] that God in his greatness would be able
[38:14] to express the greatest work that he had
[38:17] ever been able to accomplish
[38:19] we still marvel at the creation of the
[38:21] stars in the universe and the earth
[38:23] itself
[38:24] botany life animal life all the things
[38:26] that our Father has done but yet we know
[38:30] his greatest work was not achieved in
[38:32] any of that
[38:33] it speaks of his greatness truly but the
[38:36] greatest thing that was ever
[38:38] accomplished was in the weakness of the
[38:41] body of his own sonship that God would
[38:45] choose something that would be so
[38:47] powerless representing himself in such a
[38:51] weak way I like the way that brother
[38:54] Branham deals with and he says there's
[38:56] one thing that we've got to master if we
[38:59] expect to fulfill God's desire and our
[39:02] life and that is we have to master the
[39:04] salt of human ability if we ever get to
[39:07] a spot where we think that we can do it
[39:10] all on our own our own intelligence our
[39:13] own abilities we've got to master that
[39:16] in such a way that we can get rid of the
[39:19] thing and lay it aside so that God can
[39:22] use this now where where is brother
[39:25] branham getting that thought I don't
[39:27] believe that he just drew it out a space
[39:30] somewhere but I believe that he's
[39:32] drawing it from the very patterns of the
[39:35] Old Testament he's drawing it from the
[39:37] patterns of the four Gospels but more
[39:40] importantly he's drawing it from the
[39:42] very pattern of our God himself
[39:45] revealing himself in the form of sonship
[39:48] now whether or not you understand it the
[39:50] Lord Jesus must have allowed himself to
[39:54] feel this thought in his human journey
[39:58] on the earth he must have allowed
[40:01] himself to feel that there was a salt of
[40:05] human ability now in order for us to
[40:09] conquer this in order for it to be
[40:12] placed under our feet we must have a
[40:15] high priest that can relate to every
[40:18] prayer that we will ever pray so if we
[40:21] have to
[40:22] right Lord helped me to master the
[40:24] thought of human ability then our
[40:27] priests must have experienced that
[40:30] thought that feeling himself and
[40:32] understanding how that one would feel
[40:35] empowered by Almighty God but remember
[40:39] the difference was between him and us
[40:41] was that we only have a very very small
[40:44] portion but he had the fullness of the
[40:47] Godhead bodily
[40:48] dwelling in him and it must have
[40:50] imparted to him as he's learning in this
[40:54] human contradiction
[40:55] it must have imparted into him and the
[40:59] human make up that he had strengths an
[41:02] ability that would make him tend to lean
[41:05] toward the human side he must feel what
[41:09] preachers will feel he must feel what
[41:12] his musicians will feel down through the
[41:15] church ages what song readers would feel
[41:18] and deacons would feel and even just
[41:21] everyday strong Christians that they
[41:24] would feel that they have an ability to
[41:26] accomplish what God wants for them in
[41:29] their lives and they feel that they're
[41:30] doing it and they're feel that as a why
[41:32] as a housewife they're doing a pretty
[41:34] good job and they're raising the kids
[41:36] and they're doing you know a very good
[41:38] job of that and I had around the house
[41:41] they keep the house clean and they're
[41:43] able to be a pretty good wife and
[41:44] they're able to be a pretty good mother
[41:46] and they get to the spot well you know
[41:48] what I think I'm doing really a pretty
[41:51] good job but actually God wants your
[41:53] sister to master that thought of human
[41:56] ability and if you look around in your
[41:59] life and you'll see sometimes your
[42:01] children but we'll begin to raise up and
[42:03] things will come in your house and
[42:06] you're wondering what in the world is
[42:07] going on Lord everything seemed to be
[42:10] going so good I wonder if it's not God
[42:14] letting you be tried to prove that you
[42:17] as a housewife don't have the ability on
[42:20] your own to hold it all together
[42:22] I wonder sometimes it's us brothers as
[42:26] the men of the hole if God will not
[42:28] allow things to come our way
[42:30] now even though we don't like it even
[42:33] though we all despise the things that
[42:36] we're going through and the change in
[42:37] our life and all this thing with this
[42:39] virus but yet we know our God still has
[42:42] it all control the devil may have pull
[42:44] things over on us but he ain't pulled it
[42:46] over on our God at all
[42:48] but I wonder if God will allow things to
[42:51] come our way that would so get it out of
[42:53] our norm that would get it out of our
[42:56] ability that we can control this and we
[42:59] can choose this and we can choose that
[43:02] that God would help us again to realize
[43:05] Lord we are helpless and hopeless
[43:08] without you in our life lord I may try
[43:11] to be a pretty good father
[43:12] I may try to be a pretty good husband
[43:14] and a pretty good grandfather and try to
[43:17] do it as best as I can as be a pastor
[43:19] but yet Lord there's things that come
[43:21] against us that we just have absolutely
[43:24] no control over and we confess it Lord
[43:27] God we need you to even live our
[43:30] everyday lives as their right brothers
[43:33] now think that if brother Branham would
[43:36] make such a profound statement that we
[43:39] must master the salt of human ability
[43:41] then I believe I'm sure you will agree
[43:44] with me as well that the message
[43:46] followers will contend was this great
[43:50] battle that he is setting forth for us
[43:52] now no doubt this had never been
[43:54] preached quite this way before men had
[43:57] preached on trials and tests and
[43:59] Spurgeon himself won the Great Prince of
[44:01] preachers and actually use this as a
[44:03] background for several sermons that he
[44:05] preached in Wickliffe and Luther and
[44:07] many different men but the battle had so
[44:10] progressed from the time that those men
[44:13] had lived and the time that better
[44:15] Brandon preaches since in 1961 now we
[44:18] sing how much harder is the battle today
[44:21] in 2020 than it was in 1961 when brother
[44:25] Branham preaches and if time goes on and
[44:27] men still are alive in preaching five
[44:30] years from now it'll be harder five
[44:32] years from now than what it is tonight
[44:35] so we know then as the words of God grow
[44:39] and the channel of God moves in the
[44:41] progression of life that God can take
[44:43] the exact same words and update the
[44:45] inspiration and that's why we can preach
[44:48] from a Bible that's 2,000 years old a
[44:50] New Testament so the notices he says
[44:53] where we think that we can have the
[44:56] intelligence and our own abilities we've
[44:58] got to master that in such a way that we
[45:01] can get rid of the thing and lay it
[45:03] aside so that God can use us that's
[45:06] right
[45:07] notice he says we make a complete
[45:09] surrender we cannot use one ability now
[45:13] the Prophet is not talking about
[45:16] god-given talents he's not talking about
[45:19] god-given gifts he's talking about
[45:22] things that we inherited from our mother
[45:25] from our father from a mother's side
[45:28] from our father's side abilities or
[45:31] learned abilities education scholarships
[45:35] and so on and we take that as abilities
[45:38] and we try to tackle the job with our
[45:41] abilities instead of our god-given gifts
[45:45] notice this he says we cannot use one
[45:48] ability we've got to make a complete
[45:51] surrender and to come to God you've got
[45:54] to surrender to him both soul and body
[45:56] and spirit everything that you are has
[46:00] to be surrendered to God in order that
[46:03] he can work his will in you and in me
[46:08] now listen I says this I know that's
[46:11] hard I know that's hard because I we're
[46:19] always wanting to put our part in
[46:23] I don't believe brother branham Buddha
[46:24] said this if it was not the truth so
[46:27] every one of us in weather or preacher
[46:30] song leader housewife factory worker
[46:32] pain or farmer whatever we are every one
[46:34] of us in our call of God want to put our
[46:38] part in to what God called us to do and
[46:40] whenever we do we go to mix in what God
[46:43] wants for us and what we think about it
[46:46] and we're only hindering him from being
[46:49] able to flow fully and our lives now he
[46:51] says something that we know you know
[46:54] that we want to do we said well I just
[46:56] know I just know it should be done this
[47:01] way but as long as you're doing it that
[47:04] way it's going to be wrong now there
[47:10] ain't no high flow well God will take
[47:12] high for his way and high fuel and well
[47:14] it ain't exactly what God wanted but
[47:16] that's ok I'll use it no if it ain't
[47:18] God's Way it's wrong there's only one
[47:21] way about it's God's Way or it's the
[47:23] wrong way but as long as you're doing it
[47:25] that way it's going to be wrong and God
[47:27] will never use that effort now think
[47:31] about it we could put for so much effort
[47:34] we could put for so much ability and
[47:37] Wicked's be sincere and we could do it
[47:40] was all of our hearts but if we've got
[47:43] that one little thing that's not exactly
[47:45] right and that is lacking a complete
[47:48] surrender then according to what the
[47:50] Prophet said God will never use that
[47:53] effort now I'm all out of the message
[47:55] folks don't like it whenever I read this
[47:57] next quote then when other ministers
[47:59] read it but I'm going to read it in a
[48:01] way because I believe you brothers
[48:02] believe the message and you saints that
[48:03] are streaming tonight so I believe you
[48:05] can take it I've often said the greatest
[48:09] enemy of God is the man that many
[48:15] message people otherwise I wonder how it
[48:20] would make God feel to know what the
[48:23] message people do to William branham's
[48:25] greatest enemy well hallelujah
[48:29] now the senators say what he said let's
[48:31] say what the tapes say I won't and say
[48:34] the greatest enemy I've got is William
[48:37] Branham praise the Lord
[48:39] he's the one that gets in God's Way he's
[48:45] the one that gets lazy he's the one that
[48:50] gets to a place sometimes where he
[48:53] thinks he can do something about it I
[48:56] don't believe other brand was being
[48:57] humble brother Branham was being honest
[49:00] now this just go ahead and say the
[49:02] truths about it brother Branham was born
[49:04] as lost as all the rest of us has born
[49:06] lost brother Branham need to be saved
[49:08] brother man need the Holy Ghost
[49:10] rather than need to repent and brother
[49:12] Branham made some mistakes and lots of
[49:14] them now if you don't argue with me
[49:17] he himself said he made mistakes I'm
[49:19] only saying the other quotes that the
[49:21] rest of you folks that say don't make
[49:23] mistakes
[49:24] one quote you're telling a lie you're
[49:26] not saying all they say it now this man
[49:29] was a human this is the reason I can
[49:32] follow this kind of man I cannot follow
[49:35] the William Branham that is projected
[49:38] from headquarters because that William
[49:40] Branham is false he never lived that
[49:43] William Branham never existed the
[49:46] William Branham I'll follow had to
[49:48] repeat he had to get saved he had to get
[49:50] the Holy Ghost he had to go before God
[49:52] over and over again as a matter of fact
[49:55] the Holy Ghost called him a hypocrite
[49:57] because he lied well praise the Lord the
[50:00] Holy Ghost called him a hypocrite is
[50:03] that the truth the angel the Lord had to
[50:05] rebuke him because he got his fish and
[50:07] lion tangled up and said you an out
[50:10] there explaining something and you
[50:11] didn't even understand it yourself and
[50:14] you caused all these carnal
[50:17] impersonations brother Branham is the
[50:19] one who caused him according to what he
[50:21] said y'all can say Amen right that's
[50:24] what he said now this is the man William
[50:28] Branham that would get in God's Way so
[50:31] how did brother Branham going before the
[50:34] Lord Jesus
[50:35] whenever brother Branham would
[50:37] in God's Way how could brother branham
[50:40] go to a high priest that could not
[50:42] understand the humanity level that would
[50:46] get in God's way unless he allowed
[50:50] himself to feel the pull on his humanity
[50:54] and to try to make it get in God's Way
[50:58] now he never did Jesus never did
[51:01] we have no example where Jesus ever
[51:04] failed God we have no example the Lord
[51:07] Jesus ever lost his temper that he ever
[51:10] got upset well praise the Lord you'll
[51:12] find no example you'll find no scripture
[51:15] shall find no quotes that I've ever run
[51:17] across where Jesus ever lost his tempers
[51:20] you know really got upset and had to
[51:22] come back repent he never had to repent
[51:24] it was send us but he had to allow
[51:26] himself to feel that and then conquer it
[51:31] in order to know how you would feel when
[51:34] you wouldn't conquer it now as our high
[51:37] priest he must allow his humanity to
[51:41] feel the feeling of one that would
[51:44] succumb to it but if he would have made
[51:47] one mistake he could have never been our
[51:49] sacrifice if he one time would have ever
[51:52] raised his voice if he one time would
[51:56] have expressed human anger the way we do
[51:59] he would not have been a sinless land
[52:01] keep that before you in looking at this
[52:04] humanity of the Lord Jesus he never ever
[52:07] one time did one thing that was wrong
[52:11] but the great saying that he allowed
[52:13] himself to do was to be able to feel
[52:16] this upon himself so when brother
[52:19] Branham would go back to the Lord Lord
[52:21] I'm so sorry I got in the way Lord Jesus
[52:24] please forgive me then the high priest
[52:27] could recall his humanity on the earth
[52:30] and recall the feeling that would come
[52:33] against
[52:34] his own humanity he never crossed that
[52:37] line now but he allowed himself to feel
[52:40] that pull this is what he was feeling in
[52:42] the Garden of Gethsemane as Paul talked
[52:46] about in the book of Hebrews that he
[52:48] called on him who was able to save him
[52:51] from death and it was heard in that he
[52:55] feared so the Lord Jesus actually peered
[52:59] into the cut of his destiny
[53:02] and he a spirit God is there any other
[53:06] way that man's Redemption I was not
[53:09] trying to get away from redeeming his
[53:11] bride but he was simply looking for an
[53:14] easier way isn't that what we do because
[53:18] God's Way will always be just a little
[53:20] bit harder or maybe I should sit this
[53:22] way God's Way will always be a whole lot
[53:25] harder than our way because if we
[53:27] humanly could choose the way to get to
[53:29] heaven when mood straighten out all the
[53:31] curves in the road would have leveled
[53:33] out all the bumps would make it a whole
[53:35] lot easier along the way women have near
[53:37] as many trials and tests and so on but
[53:39] of course God don't do it that way and
[53:41] the Lord Jesus as he looked at it as a
[53:44] man he must allow himself to look at the
[53:47] cup and he said father if it be thy will
[53:50] let this cup pass from me I've said the
[53:53] same thing time and time again and so if
[53:55] you and I'm so glad with the Lord that
[53:57] whenever we do that we can go to our
[54:00] high priest and he's not going to draw
[54:02] out a flaming sword and just cut her
[54:04] head off but he knows exactly how we
[54:07] feel because he himself I got so
[54:11] disappointed with people he got so let
[54:13] down by people and so discouraged I
[54:16] imagined the Lord Jesus felt more
[54:18] discouragement than any human being that
[54:21] ever lived on the face of the earth he
[54:23] must have felt so downtrodden I'm so sad
[54:26] we think how sad we feel with things
[54:29] that happened in this life oh wait we
[54:31] don't know sadness
[54:32] we do not know sadness to the degree
[54:35] that he felt it and yet he allowed
[54:37] himself to feel this way so
[54:39] and we feel sad we could go to him and
[54:42] he would lift us up
[54:43] notice this better Bram said speaking
[54:45] about himself he's the one that gets
[54:47] lazy he's the one that gets to a place
[54:49] sometime where he thinks he can do
[54:51] something about and when he does that
[54:54] shoves God right out of the picture now
[55:00] if you're not following this william
[55:03] branham you're following of false
[55:05] prophet you are following a man that has
[55:09] been made by message followers that
[55:12] never existed he is a prophet of your
[55:15] imagination this is the weird the real
[55:20] william branham well hallelujah well
[55:24] some folks just clicked off the internet
[55:26] did they well that's all right notice
[55:28] this notice he said that shoves God
[55:31] right out of the picture but one I can
[55:35] get rid of that guy what God William
[55:40] Branham so does that make them brother
[55:43] man's flesh and brother man's genealogy
[55:46] does that make them God's pics
[55:48] absolutely not
[55:49] our branham's more close to God than all
[55:52] the rest of us no did they have a
[55:54] special advantage not one it's a matter
[55:56] of fact are more responsible that's
[55:59] right because they lived around this man
[56:01] their mothers and their fathers and now
[56:02] their grandchildren but now think of it
[56:04] he said this God notice what he referred
[56:07] to himself as when I can get rid of that
[56:11] guy it's hard to me care for that oh boy
[56:15] too much well I can get rid of that guy
[56:18] when I can get to a place that he's out
[56:22] of the way then God can come over and do
[56:27] things that william branham knows
[56:31] nothing about friends we can see that in
[56:34] his life over and over
[56:36] again remember when they burned the baby
[56:38] in a brother branham astir pray for the
[56:40] baby and there supposed to be a hat
[56:42] laying over on the table but brother
[56:44] branham reaches over and grabs the baby
[56:46] and instead of the baby getting better
[56:48] at God worse and then he said Oh God
[56:50] forgive me Lord I'm so wrong what'd he
[56:52] do he jumped ahead of the vision come on
[56:55] now don't get quiet
[56:56] he jumped ahead of the vision and then
[56:58] he Lord if you'll forgive me that's the
[57:00] person that would you still got
[57:01] confidence yes but the random I do well
[57:04] the man walked in late the hat down then
[57:06] what everything was in the right place
[57:08] who got in God's Way it wasn't Gabriel
[57:11] who got in God's Way and what Michael it
[57:14] was the man William Branham who gets in
[57:18] God's way in my ministry it's the man
[57:20] Donny Reagan who gets and our wards way
[57:23] of his Minister it's the man Darrell
[57:25] Ward it gets a Louie's way who gets in
[57:27] his way who gets in your way those of
[57:29] you that are streaming at home it is you
[57:32] that's our greatest enemy and Satan will
[57:36] do everything he can to keep us from
[57:39] recognizing who our greatest enemy or
[57:41] you say it's the devil I'll tell you one
[57:43] thing hope you understand what I want to
[57:45] say in reality the devil is not your
[57:48] greatest enemy the devil cannot make you
[57:51] smoke he cannot make you drink he cannot
[57:55] make you pick up your phone and look at
[57:57] something you shouldn't look at you
[57:59] still got free moral agency you can
[58:02] still say no you can turn him down
[58:05] you are your greatest
[58:08] and when we can bring us under control
[58:11] that's when we'll see God do something
[58:16] praise be to God
[58:19] oma and God can come over and do things
[58:24] that Donny Reagan Darrell Ward
[58:27] Larry Elliot hey Raven knows nothing
[58:35] nothing
[58:37] knows nothing notice he didn't say knows
[58:43] 98% but knows nothing there's part of
[58:48] God's Way even its message we've been
[58:51] around it we still don't know we don't
[58:53] understand well hallelujah oh my then
[59:01] God can come over and do things that
[59:03] william branham knows nothing about but
[59:06] my heart is gonna be scored set to this
[59:08] huh I feel it already then when that's
[59:11] when God can you ship that's when he can
[59:16] use any of you he can use anybody when
[59:20] we can get out of the way but as long as
[59:23] we got ourselves in the way then we
[59:27] cannot all right oh my god passes those
[59:32] who thinks there's something to take
[59:35] somebody that don't know nothing to
[59:39] order to work his purpose in their life
[59:43] that's what we get god said to Paul my
[59:45] strength is perfect in your weakness my
[59:49] strength becomes more perfect praise God
[59:54] this will make a lick of sense to the
[59:56] human mind to the human understanding my
[59:59] strength becomes more perfect
[1:00:02] as you become more weaker my strengths
[1:00:08] becomes more perfect I'll tell you one
[1:00:10] thing it must be really recent a good
[1:00:13] set of perfection around us ain't it
[1:00:15] whoa we're weaker and weaker and weaker
[1:00:18] miles I was having an office time it was
[1:00:21] just a third of us been able to come to
[1:00:23] church I talked about the JD on Sunday I
[1:00:25] said you know what we need to change
[1:00:26] this let's merge us in the true groups I
[1:00:29] think we can make it work
[1:00:30] I imagine the devil he'll his sides on
[1:00:33] Monday here's a life in the midde ha ha
[1:00:36] ha big boy now you're going back to 10
[1:00:38] but hang tight devil we'll be back and
[1:00:40] we'll be stronger than we've ever been
[1:00:42] before all I'm saying is you better
[1:00:44] watch out Katy a better bar of the door
[1:00:46] because the sons of God's gonna rise
[1:00:48] back again amen that's right we will not
[1:00:52] be defeated we are undefeatable we
[1:00:55] absolutely will not go down but who
[1:00:58] knows what will come out of our
[1:01:00] hardships and our difficulties and our
[1:01:02] trials that says we get weaker and
[1:01:05] weaker the way the world looks at it
[1:01:07] that God's truth will be so strong
[1:01:10] inside of us I'll tell you how strong he
[1:01:12] wants it to be he wants it to be so
[1:01:14] strong in us that our bodies can't take
[1:01:17] it no more that's the power of God and
[1:01:19] it's God do one of these days it'll
[1:01:21] change us back to young people MA think
[1:01:27] of this God passes those who thinks
[1:01:29] there's something to take somebody that
[1:01:33] don't know nothing now there's a great
[1:01:36] difference and somebody that don't know
[1:01:39] nothing and somebody that's acting like
[1:01:42] they don't know nothing when really in
[1:01:45] their self they think they know a lot
[1:01:46] and they want to classify that is
[1:01:50] humility nothing you know I'm nothing
[1:01:52] I'm nobody hell right they don't believe
[1:01:54] that not only they notice this God
[1:01:57] passes those who thinks or something to
[1:01:59] take somebody that don't know nothing to
[1:02:01] order to work his purpose in their life
[1:02:04] that's what we get go
[1:02:05] said the poem my strength is perfect in
[1:02:07] your weakness my strength becomes more
[1:02:09] perfect as you become more weaker more
[1:02:12] you can yield to me the better I can you
[1:02:17] show the more you can forget about your
[1:02:20] education the more you can forget about
[1:02:23] your denomination the more you can
[1:02:26] forget about your stuff we've all got a
[1:02:29] lot of stuff this is the stuffier sage
[1:02:32] it's ever been on the earth we got some
[1:02:35] much stuff and stuff about this and
[1:02:37] stuff about that but the more you can
[1:02:39] forget about your stuff and you yourself
[1:02:41] to me the more I can use you because you
[1:02:44] become weak and I'll make my own purpose
[1:02:49] strong God can make strength out of
[1:02:55] weakness that's the reason he always
[1:02:59] does it
[1:03:00] now we take for instance like enable
[1:03:03] from Abel comes Seth and Seth's lineage
[1:03:06] come right down I'm down to Noah's time
[1:03:09] all of them were just humble farmers but
[1:03:11] Cain's children become smart shrewd
[1:03:14] educated great men builders professional
[1:03:17] men but God's side was weak
[1:03:20] and humble that's how God use them
[1:03:23] that's God's opportunity that's God's
[1:03:26] Way of getting to us is when were weak
[1:03:30] oh my we get something then this
[1:03:36] encourages of of course cuz God's whole
[1:03:40] kingdom is built out of these kind of
[1:03:44] people who would want this kind of
[1:03:48] people but God who would want a person
[1:03:51] like the woman at the well who would
[1:03:54] want a man like Peter who would want
[1:03:57] people like us nobody but God so i'ma go
[1:04:01] so so bad the devil
[1:04:02] wrote us off some of us is in such a bad
[1:04:05] shape Imam I even demons out of help
[1:04:07] others are very no hope for them at all
[1:04:09] but Jesus reputation is made among
[1:04:12] people like us people that are they all
[1:04:14] scouring of the world or so to be
[1:04:16] because we're able to come to a spot to
[1:04:19] realize the Lord we can't do it and we
[1:04:21] don't just say that when they first get
[1:04:23] say but the longer were saved and the
[1:04:25] farther we go on their journey the more
[1:04:27] we realize long I can't even walk
[1:04:29] without you holding my hand I don't even
[1:04:32] know how to pray lord I don't even know
[1:04:34] what chapter to read today on the Bible
[1:04:37] leave me Lord Jesus I don't know how to
[1:04:39] face the devil I don't know how to face
[1:04:41] this journey but Lord God I just present
[1:04:44] myself to you and I believe you'll give
[1:04:46] me strength
[1:04:47] o my notice it's the case with us not
[1:04:52] that we're too weak the case is we're
[1:04:58] too strong we're we're just too strong
[1:05:03] that's all the thing of it is we're too
[1:05:09] strong headed strong headed that's right
[1:05:14] we're too strongly ahead we know too
[1:05:18] much praise the Lord God wants to get
[1:05:23] that out of us now now we've been around
[1:05:27] for so many decades around the message
[1:05:29] of the hour now I know so much about the
[1:05:31] message when a preacher goes to court on
[1:05:33] a quote people can sit in the pews and
[1:05:35] tell them if it left out on Andrew the
[1:05:37] arrow dot dot and we can quote all that
[1:05:41] but do we have faith to make it live in
[1:05:43] our lives when all hell is coming
[1:05:46] against us and our babies broke out in a
[1:05:48] fever and they don't know how we're
[1:05:50] going to pay our bills so we go all the
[1:05:51] pieces or do they take that word that's
[1:05:53] in her head and believe that God will
[1:05:56] stand right there with us what is it
[1:05:58] it's a message education we are becoming
[1:06:02] more educated more educated and I
[1:06:04] realize every quote I put
[1:06:06] on the screen here from preaching I
[1:06:07] realize the danger side of that if I can
[1:06:10] say it that way is that it will enhance
[1:06:13] people's education as long as they let
[1:06:16] it go that way that quote will become
[1:06:19] Farm Show that's the reason I do it
[1:06:21] because an image and it has a power on
[1:06:23] you but we don't want it just to be an
[1:06:25] image that's imprinted in our mind that
[1:06:27] we can be able to quote it and send
[1:06:29] outside and debate back and forth but we
[1:06:31] want a hallelujah in the midst of
[1:06:34] trouble in the midst of trials when the
[1:06:36] Spirit of God brings that quote and
[1:06:38] pulls it right back in your memory and
[1:06:40] helps you to say devil get out of my way
[1:06:43] Satan in the name of Jesus I rebuke
[1:06:45] y'all for my child
[1:06:47] I rebuke you out of my body this is my
[1:06:49] Tabernacle in the name of Jesus leave it
[1:06:52] we don't want it just to be quotes we
[1:06:55] don't want to tell education we want it
[1:06:57] to be Rhema words from God and of course
[1:07:01] he's the only one that can do that
[1:07:02] notice this oh my said that's right
[1:07:06] we're too strong in our head we know too
[1:07:08] much God wants to get that out of us God
[1:07:11] want us to forget the quotes God want us
[1:07:13] to forget Scripture no but he wants us
[1:07:16] to forget our ability of how we know how
[1:07:18] I would through thinking we can use it
[1:07:20] Satan could quote that word MA he could
[1:07:23] quote that word like a theologian he is
[1:07:25] a theologian he cannot quote any
[1:07:27] preacher in this message but he can't
[1:07:29] live it
[1:07:31] notice this Moses realized it I love the
[1:07:36] way says this God took him in the back
[1:07:38] in the back in the wilderness to learn
[1:07:41] some human weaknesses oh my goodness why
[1:07:45] in the world would people need to learn
[1:07:47] human weakness well it's when you feel
[1:07:48] like you're so superior that you ain't
[1:07:50] got none
[1:07:50] he took him back to learn what it was
[1:07:53] all about so well did he learn oh my did
[1:07:56] he ever get a lesson God must have had a
[1:07:59] time of him
[1:08:00] you know Moses had a temper and he gave
[1:08:03] him the wife by the name of Sephora and
[1:08:05] she had one too so I imagined everything
[1:08:09] wasn't so pleasing on the backside of
[1:08:11] the desert for a while when both of
[1:08:13] their tempers got out of control at the
[1:08:16] same time well hallelujah I suppose his
[1:08:20] intellectual conception of how
[1:08:23] psychology ought to control a person
[1:08:25] didn't do much good don't do a whole lot
[1:08:28] of good in the day we're living in does
[1:08:30] it people take their uppers and their
[1:08:32] diners and this and that and the other
[1:08:34] but you don't want all Prince Moses got
[1:08:36] to thinking you know what I'm I believe
[1:08:37] I'm God's man I believe hallelujah I can
[1:08:40] just take care of this thing all God's
[1:08:42] got to do is just give me a go-ahead and
[1:08:44] I'll roll up my sleeves and just do
[1:08:45] whatever God needs to be done outer God
[1:08:48] said you need a wife oh Jesus I mean you
[1:08:55] need a wife beautiful Egyptian women God
[1:09:03] one of them women that'll just bow down
[1:09:05] to me that wasn't what I was thinking I
[1:09:13] was thinking of sapore
[1:09:15] support what in the world zip all in the
[1:09:19] world is that oh god is she was she
[1:09:22] gonna worship me and she gonna think on
[1:09:24] this great mighty Prince you'll see but
[1:09:29] she's the one you need oh my goodness
[1:09:35] now I've got to tread carefully right
[1:09:36] here since it's all men in this place
[1:09:38] tonight
[1:09:39] we don't want our sisters showing up
[1:09:40] your Saturday night marching out to our
[1:09:42] protesting or something but Amen it can
[1:09:45] happen both ways and help it God God can
[1:09:48] give a woman the kind of man that maybe
[1:09:49] it's not too sweet either but I'm just
[1:09:52] reading the quote now y'all just do
[1:09:53] whatever you wanted I'm just reading a
[1:09:55] quote notice he said I suppose his
[1:09:57] intellectual conception of how
[1:09:59] psychology ought to control a person
[1:10:01] didn't do much good because when he was
[1:10:03] on his road down to Egypt aussi Sapporo
[1:10:05] still had a
[1:10:06] she got the foreskin of her son off and
[1:10:09] throwed it before Moses and said you're
[1:10:10] a bloody husband to me God was so angry
[1:10:13] with him he looked for him in the end if
[1:10:15] he could have found him he would have
[1:10:17] slayed him I got some ones little
[1:10:19] sayings God had to teach him back there
[1:10:21] that he was a human can you imagine in
[1:10:24] your mind this man got to a spot he
[1:10:28] didn't think he was a human now I know
[1:10:33] it might be hard for Sammy able to come
[1:10:35] for him but believe it or not ideal was
[1:10:36] some that nearly think that idea was
[1:10:40] something to think there a God as a
[1:10:43] matter of fact I know someone who said
[1:10:45] not long back that they wish they could
[1:10:46] take God's place for a little while
[1:10:47] because they felt like they could Verde
[1:10:49] to run things but you see God was gonna
[1:10:58] say wait a minute I I made a mistake
[1:11:00] here about Moses I miscalculated how
[1:11:02] strong he was no God actually chose him
[1:11:05] on purpose and let him go that way and
[1:11:07] be educated and be strong and be a God
[1:11:13] so he could get married the marriage
[1:11:17] took care of his Scott ship brought him
[1:11:21] down to be a humble man that learned how
[1:11:24] to say yes ma'am well praise the Lord
[1:11:29] the stand brothers will all be dismissed
[1:11:31] oh ma notice he said God had to teach
[1:11:37] him mama some things that he was a human
[1:11:41] all of his wisdom of Egypt all of his
[1:11:43] powers of his intellectual God could not
[1:11:46] use or one of them now your nights and
[1:11:50] how much psychology and astrology all
[1:11:53] these things and Moses and Ernest have
[1:11:55] bought water deliver I'll be I'll tell
[1:11:57] you one thing
[1:11:58] Oh
[1:12:00] my about a week of the sapore who
[1:12:06] astrology didn't help nothing raiding
[1:12:09] the Stars he probably looked for
[1:12:11] opportunities to be out it not to read
[1:12:13] the stars oh god do I have to go back
[1:12:15] home oh god do I have to go back home
[1:12:18] God had to teach him some human weakness
[1:12:20] because Moses in his mind had got so
[1:12:24] elevated notice whenever you get licked
[1:12:28] and you realize you're licked
[1:12:31] then come on back and humble yourself
[1:12:34] get weak find out you're human so
[1:12:39] apparently there must be more cases of
[1:12:41] it on the earth there must be a whole
[1:12:43] lot more folks that don't think they're
[1:12:45] human ain't it they must think they're
[1:12:47] angels for theophanies or whatever more
[1:12:49] I'm so glad I know I'm just an ignoramus
[1:12:52] I'm so glad that I know I'm a human and
[1:12:54] there's none of your intellectuals can
[1:12:56] do it human weakness will never be used
[1:12:59] notices by God God by the human
[1:13:02] weaknesses pours himself into you I love
[1:13:08] this then he uses himself this is 5uq me
[1:13:14] heard me pray this for over 30 years God
[1:13:17] used this part of yourself that you put
[1:13:20] in my life use this part of yourself
[1:13:24] that you put in my life you see when
[1:13:26] preachers separate that and they think
[1:13:28] they're the guy they think they're the
[1:13:31] one they're the professional preacher
[1:13:32] we've got some in the message and that's
[1:13:34] what they are - there are professional
[1:13:36] preachers they ain't got no they don't
[1:13:37] need the anointing they don't need
[1:13:38] inspiration they can preach with them
[1:13:40] without it you can that's exactly right
[1:13:42] you can take my word for - brother
[1:13:43] Darrell he had wanted to tell him
[1:13:44] several years ago I can preach with the
[1:13:46] anointing or without it don't really
[1:13:47] even need it well I'll tell you one
[1:13:49] thing I need it every time I get up to
[1:13:51] preach I'm scared to death and once he
[1:13:53] comes I'm good
[1:13:55] oh my but until he does I'm an absolute
[1:13:57] nervous wreck can you imagine that God
[1:14:00] is we move out of the
[1:14:01] then God takes that part of himself this
[1:14:04] is what he was doing in the body of the
[1:14:07] Lord Jesus spirit God was taking that
[1:14:10] part of himself and using that this is
[1:14:13] the head of the new race this is the way
[1:14:16] the rest of the race will follow in that
[1:14:18] same example the eternal will use
[1:14:21] himself to live his own life out of week
[1:14:25] hallelujah we human beings that get up
[1:14:29] every day with difficulties and problems
[1:14:31] and surrounded by issues and in their
[1:14:34] mind they're trying to sort through it
[1:14:35] oh god help me how in the world can it
[1:14:38] be and God says let me have it I'll be
[1:14:41] with you today don't don't don't don't
[1:14:43] try to work it out yourself why don't
[1:14:44] you let me have it I'll give you my joy
[1:14:46] you give me your problems I'll give you
[1:14:50] my peace Alleluia I'll give you my peace
[1:14:53] you give me your issues I'll give you my
[1:14:57] comfort and my peace and the tribal
[1:14:59] trouble you give me all your problems
[1:15:01] and I'll work them out for you would be
[1:15:06] most foolish not to accept that rather
[1:15:09] oh I love this he said God by human
[1:15:12] weaknesses pours himself into you then
[1:15:16] he uses himself you just become an
[1:15:20] instrument certainly you got to get
[1:15:24] yourself out of the way now this is one
[1:15:30] of the reasons that our high priest had
[1:15:34] to become weak
[1:15:35] second Corinthians 13:4 for though he
[1:15:38] was crucified through weakness yet he
[1:15:43] liveth by the power of God for we also
[1:15:46] are weak in him but we shall live with
[1:15:51] him by the power of God towards him
[1:15:56] Hebrews chapter 5 verse 1 for every high
[1:16:01] priest now what's the parallel that Paul
[1:16:03] is gonna run to the Levitical order and
[1:16:06] the order of Christ which is the
[1:16:09] Melchizedek order for every high priest
[1:16:13] taken from among men is ordained for men
[1:16:18] in things pertaining to God then you may
[1:16:22] offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
[1:16:26] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[1:16:34] and then your brothers that I can see
[1:16:37] visibly know that we still can do some
[1:16:39] pretty ignorant foolish things I'm glad
[1:16:44] he don't just have compassion on the
[1:16:47] smart the intelligent and those who
[1:16:50] always make the right decision sometimes
[1:16:54] we make some of the dumbest decisions
[1:16:57] I'm so glad when we do that our God
[1:17:01] don't mark us off and write us off he
[1:17:04] please for our ignorance praise God it
[1:17:10] ain't always that you're ignorant about
[1:17:12] the correct formula baptism it isn't
[1:17:14] that you're ignorant about what is that
[1:17:16] dress the center in decent you should be
[1:17:18] able to know that but now but if
[1:17:20] sometimes when they do stupid stuff and
[1:17:22] we let the devil take advantage in our
[1:17:25] lives or we mess up in my we say the
[1:17:28] wrong thing or at the wrong time or
[1:17:30] whatever more and we caused this person
[1:17:32] a problem in that one and the NAPLAN and
[1:17:34] that what is it many times
[1:17:36] it's our ignorance and our stupidity
[1:17:38] well praise the Lord anyhow but notice
[1:17:42] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[1:17:45] and on them that are out of the way for
[1:17:49] that he himself also is compassed with
[1:17:55] infirmity and it means to be affected
[1:17:58] moderately or in due measure to preserve
[1:18:02] moderation in the passions especially
[1:18:05] anger or grief hence of one who is not
[1:18:09] unduly disturbed by the errors and
[1:18:12] faults and sins of others but bears them
[1:18:15] gently notice how Paul said that when
[1:18:17] God chose a high priest he chose
[1:18:20] out from among the people so that man
[1:18:23] when he would walk in behind the veil
[1:18:26] that he would be able to walk in knowing
[1:18:29] I'll also need help and the high priest
[1:18:33] would walk in once one time of year
[1:18:35] behind the veil and unity offered the
[1:18:37] sacrifice first for himself he did not
[1:18:41] offer for the rest of the people even
[1:18:43] Atsuko and neither seven times in
[1:18:45] becoming out the very first time is for
[1:18:47] himself why because he also was a man he
[1:18:52] wasn't sending there I'm holier than you
[1:18:54] I don't need this but he offered it for
[1:18:56] himself oh my
[1:18:58] notice how the transition as it comes
[1:19:00] now to the Lord Jesus that even though
[1:19:03] he did not need a sacrifice he still
[1:19:06] wanted to enter into the place of the
[1:19:08] high priest he said Father let me
[1:19:11] understand my brothers let me understand
[1:19:14] their feelings and the weakness so I can
[1:19:17] have compassion I want to go so low that
[1:19:27] my humanity will pray to dodge the
[1:19:33] growth let me stoop so low that I will
[1:19:43] be cursed out of your sight I will be
[1:19:51] cursed out of your sight and go to hell
[1:19:57] so my brother's won't have to thank you
[1:20:02] Lord Jesus who can have compassion on
[1:20:06] the ignorant I don't mind telling you
[1:20:10] sometimes I struggle with ignorance
[1:20:12] sometimes I see people and they do
[1:20:14] things and you think lord have mercy you
[1:20:18] born yesterday you just back out of an
[1:20:21] egg somewhere why in the world would you
[1:20:23] do someone I'm just being honest and I'm
[1:20:27] the one that's got the microphone and
[1:20:29] all you sitting here and all of you out
[1:20:30] there don't like like you don't the same
[1:20:32] way
[1:20:33] sometimes we have a hard time of
[1:20:35] rendering compassion when people do
[1:20:38] stupid stuff they know that if I get
[1:20:43] into the Wafaa but the Lord Jesus needed
[1:20:51] to feel ignorance he was not inert but
[1:20:58] he needed to feel that come against him
[1:21:03] because he knew so many of his people
[1:21:07] even after the new birth would do so
[1:21:11] many ignorant things praise the Lord
[1:21:19] oh I know some of you want to act like
[1:21:23] you're super intellectual sinners you're
[1:21:27] just as stupid as the rest of us there's
[1:21:30] no high Christ sins and loke license
[1:21:33] that you seeing it's just sin notice who
[1:21:39] can have compassion on the ignorant and
[1:21:43] on them that are out of the way
[1:21:49] now this is a metaphor that Paul used
[1:21:52] here them that are out of the way it's
[1:21:54] borrowed from the terminology of the day
[1:21:57] of someone that is walking from Samaria
[1:22:00] to Jerusalem or Damascus to wherever
[1:22:03] more and they got out of the path they
[1:22:08] got out of the designated road and they
[1:22:11] had a map and they were told this is the
[1:22:14] way to live and you come up here go
[1:22:15] right that this tree certain trailer go
[1:22:17] by prayer live and they had instruction
[1:22:20] and they knew the right way to go but
[1:22:23] for whatever reason they became enticed
[1:22:25] or curiosity whatever was
[1:22:28] I actually left the beaten paths and
[1:22:31] they got out of the way and I high
[1:22:34] priest below he wanted to know how that
[1:22:38] felt
[1:22:39] how does it feel how are they feeling my
[1:22:41] sons my daughters will actually leave my
[1:22:45] declare paths I will declare it so well
[1:22:48] I will mark the path before them it will
[1:22:51] be so made known but I know them I know
[1:22:56] that there be times they will
[1:22:59] intentionally step out of paths so
[1:23:06] father
[1:23:07] let me feel I won't do it I don't leave
[1:23:15] the path but let me feel Nepal to leave
[1:23:29] hallelujah you imagine Paul goes on to
[1:23:36] say that this high priest would
[1:23:40] understand because he himself is
[1:23:42] compassed was in front of a team talked
[1:23:48] of headaches yes he understands it talks
[1:23:51] of weakness yes he understands it so he
[1:23:54] is compassed he has the same infirm
[1:23:58] nature inbred weakness and the Lord
[1:24:04] Jesus think of what he was he was the
[1:24:09] logos the very image of the invisible
[1:24:14] God the firstborn of every creature for
[1:24:20] by him all things were made and through
[1:24:23] him were all saints men he is before all
[1:24:27] things in the beginning was the word and
[1:24:31] the Word was with God and it was him and
[1:24:36] yet he chose this path
[1:24:38] to move from the great omnipotence to
[1:24:43] understand ignoramus to pull the feeling
[1:24:51] of stupidity into his body and allow
[1:24:57] stupid thoughts to go straight mind
[1:25:06] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:25:12] hallelujah now this is why the high
[1:25:16] priests can walk in and it bears the
[1:25:21] ephod and he bears the bonnet and the
[1:25:26] rib and the blue and all these
[1:25:28] significant colors and stripes and so on
[1:25:31] but he's not walking in there feeling if
[1:25:35] it's a Trula days above his brethren and
[1:25:38] apart from his brethren because yes to
[1:25:42] offer a sacrifice first for himself then
[1:25:48] he turns and comes out changes clothes
[1:25:51] goes back in again turns comes out seven
[1:25:56] times so he's still feeling the fear of
[1:26:01] his own atonement but this man this man
[1:26:09] never had doll for a sacrifice for
[1:26:12] himself he never sinned never now I have
[1:26:21] an issue with those around the message
[1:26:22] who want to make Jesus so human that
[1:26:24] they make him a sinner by action I
[1:26:27] disagree with you on the basis of the
[1:26:29] scripture and the message of the hour
[1:26:30] that is contrary to the Word of God
[1:26:33] you're going back to the first century
[1:26:36] erroneous teaching that was brought not
[1:26:38] long after the deity that Godhead was
[1:26:40] revealed he never sinned
[1:26:43] never sinned he became sin he never
[1:26:48] sinned notice Paul said in verse three
[1:26:51] and by reason here he ought as for the
[1:26:54] people so also for himself to offer for
[1:26:58] since I no man taketh this honor unto
[1:27:01] himself but he that is called of God as
[1:27:04] was Aaron I'll tell you this verse Fabri
[1:27:08] the darrell just overwhelms me so also
[1:27:12] Christ glorified not himself to be made
[1:27:22] a priest well I'll tell you one thing
[1:27:28] the folks around this message that have
[1:27:30] got the attitude bless God I'm a
[1:27:31] preacher I'm a singer I'm a guitar
[1:27:34] picker I'm this and that and the other
[1:27:35] thing y'all need to set out and hear me
[1:27:37] preach I'll tell you one thing you need
[1:27:40] to let me show you what a preacher can
[1:27:42] do and what a singer can do and our Lord
[1:27:45] Jesus our Lord Jesus never took glory to
[1:27:50] himself brother let me visit says it
[1:27:51] this way that the body of Jesus could
[1:27:55] not glory in the presence of God he said
[1:28:01] no flesh I know that he chokes you jesus
[1:28:04] only said that he said no flesh can
[1:28:07] glory in the presence of God not even
[1:28:09] the flesh of Jesus so jesus never said
[1:28:17] please don't call I've done I've done
[1:28:19] all this but he said he just remained
[1:28:21] silent they covered he did not assume
[1:28:27] okay now that I've done this don't that
[1:28:29] make me high priest now I ain't how the
[1:28:31] legal game player and I believe guitar
[1:28:33] player 99 number one only now that
[1:28:35] that's not the Spirit of Christ is there
[1:28:38] wasn't on him then it's not onlys people
[1:28:40] today those that want to be recognized
[1:28:43] and be this and be that now let me tell
[1:28:45] you something if you can't preach to one
[1:28:46] you don't got no business preaching to
[1:28:48] 500 a singer that
[1:28:50] to sing on Sunday morning only I've got
[1:28:53] a problem with them I don't mind telling
[1:28:54] you you should be one of the sing to two
[1:28:56] or three or four or five because if
[1:28:58] you're doing it not for a show you're
[1:29:00] doing it for the kingdom of God
[1:29:02] notice he said so also Christ glorified
[1:29:05] not himself to be made a high priest but
[1:29:11] he that said unto Him thou art my son
[1:29:18] today have I forgotten me you imagine
[1:29:26] the Lord Jesus after his resurrection
[1:29:30] never ask for this position if the
[1:29:38] eternal had not given it to him he would
[1:29:41] still to this day have never us to be
[1:29:52] that's the Spirit of Christ so those who
[1:29:59] have a dream and have a gift and have a
[1:30:01] tongue and have this and that and the
[1:30:02] other and they want to make themself a
[1:30:04] prophet and they want to make everybody
[1:30:07] in the church bow down to them I'll tell
[1:30:09] you right now that that spirit comes
[1:30:10] from the gates of hell that is not the
[1:30:14] Spirit of Christ we're talking about a
[1:30:16] risen Savior but he never assumed to say
[1:30:20] can I now be high priest can I now be
[1:30:22] high priests Jenna cannot can I can I
[1:30:24] can I can i Jenna Florida God he would
[1:30:30] not on himself assume this position of
[1:30:35] dignity of dignity
[1:30:43] praise be to God
[1:30:48] but if father wanted him to be high
[1:30:51] priest let father say it
[1:30:56] hey man the father wants me to be a
[1:31:00] preacher let father call me no mama no
[1:31:05] my daddy not opal whoever Moore and
[1:31:08] Grandpa so and so not my wife come on
[1:31:11] site hey they've a brother Donny wants
[1:31:13] me to be in the church to be their
[1:31:14] center will that brother Donny do it I
[1:31:16] don't want to push myself and push
[1:31:18] myself and make myself no that's why
[1:31:21] that God cannot use that type of
[1:31:23] attitude oh ma but it's so hard for us
[1:31:26] because we want to promote ourselves and
[1:31:28] push ourself and what is it that we're
[1:31:30] pushing it's not the Christ
[1:31:32] it's the humanity but notice the father
[1:31:36] said but he that said unto Him thou art
[1:31:41] my son he appointed him to this office
[1:31:46] to execute this office and anointed him
[1:31:50] with the oil of gladness above his
[1:31:53] fellows was an oath prescribed to him
[1:31:58] glory to God so also Christ glorified
[1:32:02] not himself to be made a high priest but
[1:32:05] he that said unto him thou art my son
[1:32:09] today today so it started on a certain
[1:32:17] day you know what day that was that was
[1:32:21] the day God raised him from the dead his
[1:32:25] Melchizedek Priesthood hallelujah it did
[1:32:29] not begin whenever he was just laying
[1:32:31] hands on the sick hallelujah but he had
[1:32:34] to enter into the presence of God first
[1:32:37] that's right which could not take place
[1:32:39] till after he'd raised from the dead
[1:32:42] then after that oh my god said this day
[1:32:45] thou art my son ah begotten I have
[1:32:51] raised you from the dead
[1:32:53] I have crowned you with the priesthood
[1:32:57] of milk as
[1:32:59] the power of an endless life praise God
[1:33:07] let's stand together notice this in
[1:33:10] Hebrews chapter 5 verse 6 and you say us
[1:33:13] also on another place thou art a priest
[1:33:14] forever after the order of melchizedek
[1:33:20] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:33:22] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:33:24] were strong crying and tears unto him
[1:33:28] that was able to save him from death so
[1:33:35] jesus actually prayed to be saved from
[1:33:40] death
[1:33:41] oh brother Darrell I'm so glad I'm so
[1:33:45] glad God didn't out of that prayer don't
[1:33:49] you see why I had to pray that he had to
[1:33:52] feel this how many times have I've tried
[1:33:55] tried God please please God I don't want
[1:33:59] to preach God please I get in trouble so
[1:34:02] much please God you know whenever as
[1:34:06] young I use the excuse that's too young
[1:34:08] now that I'm getting older and say God I
[1:34:10] ended up that retirement age and then
[1:34:12] even the Social Security do you know
[1:34:13] what is the next year something like
[1:34:15] that I could draw Social Security lower
[1:34:16] there mercy who ever thought I'd live
[1:34:18] that long Lord in about time for me to
[1:34:20] retire he life then he life's now so are
[1:34:23] you called laughing at me Wow because
[1:34:27] there's still something about the pain
[1:34:30] of the course there's something about
[1:34:32] the pain that we don't like oh I'm so
[1:34:37] glad he went this way in the days of his
[1:34:40] flesh notice the way that Paul separated
[1:34:42] this showing that he pre-existed before
[1:34:45] his pre incarnation
[1:34:46] this is his pre incarnated state who in
[1:34:49] the days of his flesh which many had
[1:34:53] days before his flesh well in the days
[1:34:56] of his flesh when he had offered up
[1:34:58] prayers and supplications with strong
[1:35:02] crying and tears unto him that was able
[1:35:07] to save him from death wasn't it he was
[1:35:11] praying
[1:35:12] I don't want to do this Redemption thing
[1:35:16] I don't want to do that
[1:35:17] he wanted to do it but did he have to
[1:35:21] die this was the cup if you have to go
[1:35:24] that way father is there any way that
[1:35:26] this cup what was the cup the destiny
[1:35:30] the death that laid before can this Cup
[1:35:32] he didn't he didn't pray that the whole
[1:35:33] thing a beber move notice this most of
[1:35:37] us didn't want all of our burdens rolled
[1:35:39] away
[1:35:39] we don't want although our hardships
[1:35:42] wrote away but just the ones we handpick
[1:35:44] I don't kind of go through this or I
[1:35:48] don't care to go through that but God
[1:35:50] get out could this one be dodged because
[1:35:52] this will be I'm so glad he felt that
[1:35:56] brother down when I go before him say
[1:35:58] Lord please help me God I don't want
[1:36:02] being hated God I don't want being
[1:36:04] ridiculed and last hold on young you
[1:36:06] know how you do when you go before the
[1:36:07] Lord you can say I understand honey come
[1:36:14] here buddy we're buddies together I know
[1:36:19] I know you're not wanting to get away
[1:36:21] from me you're not wanting to turn your
[1:36:22] back or just parts of your cup that you
[1:36:27] wish you could pull this drag out and
[1:36:29] that one cuz it's it's hard I understand
[1:36:33] you're not mad every Lord how could
[1:36:36] happy mad at you well not felt the same
[1:36:40] an even greater
[1:36:42] I don't feel anger towards you this is
[1:36:47] what I feel compassion but lord I hate
[1:36:52] to trouble you I know you're so busy up
[1:36:55] there in heaven oh but your need takes
[1:36:58] precedent over the praise of agency when
[1:37:03] I see the grimace on your face when your
[1:37:05] bat moves or that that need that's out
[1:37:07] of joint or whatever more it still moves
[1:37:10] my heart Jam and my glorified body been
[1:37:14] living in this body for 2,000 years and
[1:37:16] this body is entered into the phase of
[1:37:18] eternal life
[1:37:19] but I see that grimace on your face I
[1:37:22] see as you move your arm
[1:37:24] it still moves me I love you I care for
[1:37:30] you praise God I remember the days of my
[1:37:37] humanity or let me say like this the
[1:37:41] days of my humility holiday I remember
[1:37:48] what it's like to live in a tabernacle
[1:37:51] of humiliation can we practically
[1:38:00] how can we ever thank you enough sir we
[1:38:06] could praise you from millions of years
[1:38:10] throughout the ceaseless ages we could
[1:38:15] never cover it Lord but all I know to do
[1:38:20] is do the best that we can till we get
[1:38:24] our new language and get our new body
[1:38:28] then we'll be more prepared
[1:38:30] I used to ponder of the statements that
[1:38:33] brother Branham would mention about
[1:38:35] eternity something about it taking
[1:38:39] eternity for you to reveal yourself and
[1:38:42] I just ponder and ponder over that I
[1:38:44] didn't question it Lord but I guess I
[1:38:46] just didn't understand it right but the
[1:38:49] more I see of you and how great you are
[1:38:51] the more I'm seeing it ain't no wonder
[1:38:57] the more we're hearing about you just in
[1:38:59] this life as mortals how much more is
[1:39:02] there to know about you and we've never
[1:39:05] even scratched the surface we're so
[1:39:09] grateful father that in our time of
[1:39:11] weakness stress anxiety trouble when we
[1:39:17] feel so weak that you come on the scene
[1:39:21] lift up our feeble hands praise God it
[1:39:27] was when Joshua was out there that night
[1:39:30] it seemed as if though the walls were so
[1:39:34] sick and so high
[1:39:36] the enemy was so great how would he ever
[1:39:40] be able to prevail the prophet of God
[1:39:43] had been taken from before him the
[1:39:46] element of the people were disgruntled
[1:39:49] complainers and we always had them but
[1:39:53] you sent down a man which was the
[1:39:58] captain of the Lord's host and Joshua's
[1:40:02] weakest time
[1:40:04] alleluiah the captain of the hosts came
[1:40:08] down glory to God in Peter's weakest
[1:40:15] moments when he had denied you cursed
[1:40:21] behaved awful and he felt like no doubt
[1:40:27] there's no need even trying to go back
[1:40:29] to serve him but you appeared to Mary
[1:40:33] and said go tell Peter and my disciples
[1:40:40] it was at his weakest time but in his
[1:40:45] weakest moment you called his neighbor
[1:40:49] oh Jesus I trust and have father to this
[1:40:55] little weak feeble sermon this little
[1:40:59] weak feeble count of Brethren that's
[1:41:02] sure tonight man you manifest your

[1:41:37] minister streets to your people and if
[1:41:42] there's anything good that comes out of
[1:41:44] it we know it'll have to be used it does

[1:42:29] but brother Donny I feel so weak it's so
[1:42:32] weary I just don't know when I've been
[1:42:34] so low what it sounds like to me you're
[1:42:37] a candidate for a great move of the
[1:42:41] power of God in your life if you can
[1:42:44] just let go as the Prophet said we're
[1:42:49] not too weak most of us were too strong
[1:42:52] we'll always retain an element of our
[1:42:54] self-control because for some people
[1:42:56] there's that fear I've just totally
[1:42:59] letting go it's not us driving down a
[1:43:03] road and we're in the passenger seat a
[1:43:05] person on the driver's side has been
[1:43:09] there before but we feel so anxious and
[1:43:12] so nervous we'll put on the brakes and
[1:43:16] we'll jump and we'll jerk and whatever
[1:43:18] more why because we don't feel in
[1:43:21] control why is it that even flying in an
[1:43:24] airplane and if we dive and jump and
[1:43:29] drop and whatever more
[1:43:30] I never said more than them seats in my
[1:43:33] life but for a few minutes I think I'd
[1:43:36] feel more comfortable as I was up her
[1:43:38] and said that pilot was it wouldn't take
[1:43:40] me long to know that I've made a big
[1:43:42] mistake because there's something about
[1:43:45] us being out of control that's why
[1:43:48] backseat drivers and passenger seat
[1:43:51] drivers it's that nervousness it's them
[1:43:54] not been able to trust you that you're
[1:43:56] seeing the car coming and sometimes you
[1:43:58] may not
[1:44:00] but it's us letting go taking our foot
[1:44:04] off the gas our foot off the brake our
[1:44:06] foot off the steering wheel as it was
[1:44:07] and say Lord Jesus don't be my co-pilot
[1:44:11] but be the pilot of power off and don't
[1:44:16] always second-guess him don't be able to
[1:44:18] run the passengers hand Lord turn Lord
