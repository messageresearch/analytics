[5:16] [Music]
[5:28] Well, there is going to be a meeting in
[5:33] the air in that sweet, sweet by and by.
[5:39] I'm going to meet you, meet you over
[5:44] there in that home beyond the sky.
[5:50] Such singing you will hear, never heard
[5:54] by mortal ears will be glorious, I do
[5:59] declare.
[6:01] Oh, and God's own son will be the
[6:05] leading one at that meeting
[6:09] in the air.
[6:12] You have heard of little Moses in the
[6:16] borush.
[6:18] You have heard a fearless David and his
[6:21] slain.
[6:23] You have heard the story told of
[6:26] dreaming Joseph
[6:29] and of Jonah and the well you often
[6:32] sing.
[6:34] There are many many others through the
[6:38] Bible.
[6:40] I should like to meet them all. I do
[6:43] declare
[6:45] by and by the Lord will surely let us
[6:49] meet them at that meeting
[6:53] in the air. Let's all stand. Well, there
[6:57] is going to be a meeting in the air in
[7:02] that sweet sweet bar and
[7:07] I'm going to meet you. meet you over
[7:12] there in that home beyond the sky.
[7:18] Such singing you will hear, never heard
[7:22] by mortal ear to be glorious, I do
[7:27] declare.
[7:30] And God's own son will be the leading
[7:34] one at that meeting
[7:37] in the air.
[7:41] Many things will there be missing at
[7:44] that meeting.
[7:46] For the mourers's mist will have no
[7:49] place at all.
[7:52] There will never be a sermon preached to
[7:55] sinners.
[7:57] For the sinner had refused to heed the
[8:00] call.
[8:03] There will be no mourning overworked
[8:06] love ones. There will be no lonely
[8:10] nights of pleading prayer.
[8:14] All our burdens and our anguish will be
[8:17] lifted
[8:19] at that meeting
[8:22] in the air.
[8:25] Well, there is going to be a meeting in
[8:29] the air in that sweet, sweet by
[8:35] [Music]
[8:38] to meet you, meet you there in that home
[8:43] beyond the sky.
[8:47] Such singing you will hear, never heard
[8:51] by mortal ears will be glorious, I do
[8:56] declare.
[8:57] [Music]
[8:58] Oh, and God's own son will be the
[9:02] leading one at that meeting
[9:06] in the air.
[9:09] Oh, and I'll
[9:12] fly away. Oh glory
[9:17] going to fly away.
[9:19] [Music]
[9:20] Oh when I die. Hallelujah. By and by. Oh
[9:26] I
[9:28] fly away.
[9:30] [Music]
[9:32] Some glad morning. When this life is
[9:36] over,
[9:37] I'll
[9:39] fly away
[9:43] to a home on God's celestial shore.
[9:48] I
[9:50] fly away.
[9:53] Oh, I
[9:56] fly away. Oh, glory.
[10:00] [Music]
[10:04] Oh, when I die, hallelujah, by and by,
[10:10] oh, I
[10:12] fly away.
[10:16] And when the shadows of this life have
[10:20] drawn,
[10:22] I'll
[10:23] fly away
[10:27] like a bird from prison. Bars has flown.
[10:33] I
[10:34] fly away.
[10:37] Oh,
[10:40] fly away. Oh, glory. God
[10:45] won't fly away.
[10:49] Oh, when I die. Hallelujah. By and by.
[10:54] Oh, I
[10:56] fly away. I like this verse here. Well,
[11:00] just a few more weary days and then
[11:06] I'll
[11:07] fly away
[11:10] [Music]
[11:11] to a land where my joy shall never end.
[11:16] Oh, I
[11:18] fly away.
[11:21] Oh, I
[11:24] fly away. Glory.
[11:29] Oh, far away in the morning
[11:34] when I die. Hallelujah by
[11:38] Oh, I
[11:41] fly away. Let's sing that third verse
[11:43] one more time. Just a few more weary
[11:48] days and then
[11:50] I'm
[11:51] going to fly away.
[11:55] is to a land where my joy shall never
[11:59] end. Oh, I
[12:03] fly away.
[12:06] Oh, I
[12:08] fly away. Oh, glory.
[12:14] Don't fly away.
[12:17] Oh, when I die. Hallelujah.
[12:22] by
[12:23] [Applause]
[12:25] fly away.
[12:28] Oh,

[12:36] going to fly away.
[12:39] Oh, I
[12:42] hallelujah. My and
[12:45] I
[12:47] fly away.
[12:52] Give him a hand clap of praise this
[12:54] morning.
[12:55] Hallelujah.
[12:59] How many can say it's good to be in the
[13:00] house of the Lord on this rainy nice
[13:03] little muggy. Feels like it's 92 degrees
[13:06] and it's still raining outside.
[13:08] Beautiful day to be in the house of the
[13:10] Lord. You may be seated. First off, we'd
[13:12] like to wish all our fathers a happy
[13:15] Father's Day. Y'all are blessed with a
[13:18] great father, but you didn't get the
[13:19] best one because I did.
[13:25] I learned. My mom said, "You're a great
[13:26] dad." And I was like, "I learn from the
[13:28] best." It's hard to when you have a
[13:30] great mentor in life, it's hard to
[13:32] really go astray. Amen. We'll read these
[13:35] prayer requests. And
[13:38] please be in prayer for Zack Tally. He
[13:40] is at boot camp and he's going to have a
[13:42] test coming up or will have to stay up
[13:44] for 24 hours on a ship with many
[13:47] obstacles and it's very challenging.
[13:49] Please pray he'll be able to pass so
[13:51] that he can become a sailor that was
[13:53] with no name.
[13:56] This is an unspoken prayer request for a
[13:57] family member from Sister Brenda Jones
[14:01] and brother Dawn's cousin Mary Lewis
[14:03] needs prayer as turned in by brother Don
[14:06] Cooper
[14:07] and this was turned in the library.
[14:09] Brother Bob from Connecticut is asking
[14:11] for asking for prayer for stiffness,
[14:13] heart failure, diabetes, and fear. As
[14:15] like I said, turning in the library. And
[14:18] this is a praise report from Sister
[14:20] Teresa Sailor.
[14:22] And y'all forgive me. I I'd rather if I
[14:25] could sing these, I would rather sing
[14:26] them than read them. I hate to to read
[14:28] out loud at least. But bear with me. I
[14:32] went up for prayer a couple of months
[14:33] ago for severe pain and numbness in my
[14:35] left arm. Praise the Lord. that I'm no
[14:37] longer having the severe pain and can
[14:39] once again turn my neck and use my arm.
[14:42] But my praise doesn't stop there. My
[14:44] doctor stated that I was looking at
[14:46] instant death due to severe spinal
[14:48] stenosis in my neck and insisted I see
[14:50] an orthopedic surgeon. I saw one last
[14:53] week. The nurse practitioner came in and
[14:55] stated when she saw my MRI, she said,
[14:57] "Whoa." But was surprised to look at me.
[15:00] I did not fit the picture of the MRI she
[15:03] saw. I told her I was prayed for in 2011
[15:06] and I when I was told the same thing and
[15:09] had no problems until recently. I had
[15:11] since been prayed for and my arm was
[15:13] much better. She informed me the surgery
[15:16] would require a surgically would require
[15:19] surgically fusing my spine together and
[15:21] I would no longer have range of motion
[15:23] in my neck. She went on to say they
[15:25] would not push surgery until they felt
[15:27] it was necessary because my strength in
[15:30] my both my arms and legs was strong as
[15:33] well as balance. She felt that they
[15:35] would wait and see me in four months and
[15:37] not rush into it. Thank you, Jesus.
[15:39] Please pray with me that if it's the
[15:41] Lord's will, they will want a new MRI to
[15:43] be done and they will find there is no
[15:45] longer any stenosis. What a testimony
[15:47] and witness that would be. I have held
[15:49] the words brother Donnie spoke that he
[15:51] prayed closely to my heart. I repeated
[15:55] them to myself daily and meditate
[15:56] believing it means so much more than
[15:58] just healing. I'm claiming them. Brother
[16:00] Donnie did not take them lightly.
[16:02] Brother, I do not take them lightly. I'm
[16:05] so humbled at God's amazing love and
[16:07] longsuffering he has toward me. I am
[16:09] thankful that he has allowed me to be a
[16:10] part of this body of Christ and to have
[16:12] brother Donnie as my pastor. What a
[16:14] blessed people we are to have you as our
[16:15] shepherd. You often speak about
[16:18] preaching too hard, but I've never felt
[16:19] that way. I ask the Lord to help measure
[16:21] up and let it not let it run off. Let's
[16:25] see. May the Lord bless each of the
[16:28] working in the library with our
[16:29] continued Christian walk. I apologize
[16:31] that it's lengthy. I pray this a
[16:32] blessing to have your faith as well.
[16:34] Amen.
[16:36] Glory.
[16:38] [Music]
[16:40] Let's all stand together and we'll lift
[16:42] these prayer requests for a little.
[16:43] Brother Keith, if you would just come
[16:45] pray for us.
[16:53] Praise the Lord, everybody.
[16:55] We've already wished the fathers a happy
[16:58] father's day, but I wanted to say happy
[17:00] father's day to our pastor because he is
[17:03] my father in the gospel and he means so
[17:05] much to me and I know he does to you
[17:08] all, too.
[17:13] And I also don't want to forget Papa
[17:15] God, even though it's a little
[17:18] different, but he deserves to be
[17:20] recognized every day, but today as well.
[17:23] Let's pray together. Father, thank you
[17:26] so much.
[17:28] just to be able to say the word father.
[17:31] I had amnesia and I didn't know who my
[17:33] father was and I didn't know who my
[17:35] mother was and but you came along and
[17:38] showed me the right path and day by day
[17:40] you're showing me the way how to get
[17:43] back to where you are. And just like
[17:45] that man, he's out there on the porch
[17:47] looking for his son and he's going to
[17:49] you're going to run to us. I know you
[17:51] are. But Lord, in this life that we have
[17:54] here, we have heartaches, troubles,
[17:55] woes, sicknesses, many things. But you
[17:59] have made a way. You're conscious of
[18:01] those. And we can relax just like Ruth
[18:04] resting. We can trust in you knowing
[18:06] that you have already met those needs.
[18:09] We're going to walk into them. We trust
[18:12] you. Forgive us, Lord, when we slightly
[18:15] falter in our trust of you. But Father,
[18:18] you have all things worked together for
[18:20] our good and we know they are and we
[18:23] glory in those things. And today we have
[18:25] a service that Lord, we're looking for
[18:27] another piece of the puzzle fitly snug
[18:30] together so we can see that picture of
[18:32] us in a new body and a body change. And
[18:36] Father, we've got many sick and
[18:38] afflicted. And we we just ask you to be
[18:40] merciful today and send forth your word
[18:42] and power and demonstration to heal
[18:43] them. Father, bless the remainder of
[18:46] this service. We will return and give
[18:47] praise unto you in Jesus name. Amen.
[18:54] If you'll come at this time, we'll
[18:55] receive the morning ti and offering you
[18:57] give unto the Lord. If you're visiting
[18:59] with us today, we'd like to welcome you
[19:01] to Word of Life Church. And if you're
[19:02] streaming, we'd like to welcome you as
[19:04] well. Amen. Let's sing this song. We'll
[19:07] just help me worship the Lord this
[19:09] morning. This is an old worship song.
[19:11] Lift our hands. And I woke up this
[19:14] morning. I was like I I was just
[19:15] thinking about the service today and
[19:17] listening to a tape and I was like I
[19:19] can't wait just to go and sing praises
[19:21] to the Lord. Amen.
[19:24] You give life.
[19:26] You are love.
[19:29] You bring light to the darkness.
[19:34] You give hope.
[19:37] You restore

[23:14] time.

[23:48] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Singers, if
[23:51] you'll come at this time and we'll sing
[23:54] one more song. Lately, all I've got is
[23:57] leaving on my mind. As as singers come,
[23:59] we'll sing this real quick.
[24:04] The old house
[24:07] that I'm living in is needing
[24:14] repair.
[24:17] The windows and
[24:20] the shutters
[24:23] are letting in the cold
[24:27] cold air.
[24:30] I save myself. I'm going to fix it.
[24:36] when I can find
[24:40] the time.
[24:43] Oh, but all I'm getting
[24:47] lately
[24:51] is leaving on my mind.
[24:59] Lately, all I've got is leaving
[25:05] on my mind.

[25:18] about.

[25:26] held soon and very
[25:30] soon I'll leave my trles
[25:35] far behind.
[25:39] Oh, and lately
[25:42] I've got leave
[25:48] it on my mind.
[25:56] Well, I guess I
[26:00] should be looking for a better place
[26:06] to live.
[26:08] [Music]
[26:09] Oh, but I can't seem to get excited
[26:15] about this world and what it has to
[26:20] give.
[26:23] I could care less if I could buy it all
[26:29] with a soft tear
[26:33] down.
[26:36] Oh, what good would this world do be
[26:42] with the rapture
[26:44] on my mind?
[26:52] And lately, all I've got is leave it on
[26:59] my mind.
[27:04] Oh, it seems that's all I'm thinking
[27:11] about.
[27:14] So much of the time,

[28:22] then I will bless you.

[28:30] I will forgive.
[28:34] And if you hate me,
[28:37] then I will love
[28:41] you.

[28:52] If you're helpless,
[28:55] I will defend you.
[28:59] And if you're burdened,

[31:02] enough.

[31:11] I choose to worship no matter what I
[31:16] face. I choose the Jesus way. I choose

[32:36] [Music]
[32:57] [Music]
[33:04] You. You may feel down and feel like God
[33:10] has somehow forgotten.
[33:17] That you are faced
[33:20] with circumstances
[33:22] that you can get through.
[33:25] [Music]
[33:28] But right now it seems that there's no
[33:32] way out. and you're going under.
[33:37] [Music]
[33:39] But God's proven time
[33:42] and time again that he'll take care of
[33:46] you
[33:50] and he'll do it again
[33:53] for you. He'll do it again.
[34:01] Oh, just take a look at where you are
[34:05] now and where you've been.
[34:12] He's always come through for you. He's
[34:17] the same now as it.
[34:23] You may not know how and you may not
[34:26] know it, but you'll do it again.
[34:33] God knows the things that you're going
[34:37] through
[34:39] and how you're hurting.
[34:42] [Music]
[34:44] He understands
[34:47] just how your heart has been broken
[34:50] into.
[34:54] He's the God of the sun, the stars, and
[34:58] the sea. and he is your father.
[35:05] He'll calm the storm and he'll find a
[35:09] way and he'll fix it for you
[35:15] and he'll do it again
[35:18] for you. He'll do it again.
[35:26] Lord, just take a look at where you are
[35:30] now and where you've been.
[35:36] He's always come through for you. He's
[35:41] the same now as then.
[35:46] You may not know how, and you may not
[35:50] know it, but I'll do it again.
[35:56] And he'll do it again
[36:00] for you. He'll do it again.
[36:05] [Music]
[36:07] Oh, just take a look at where you are
[36:11] now and where you've been.
[36:16] [Music]
[36:17] He's always gone through for you. is the
[36:23] same now as
[36:26] [Music]
[36:28] you may not know how and you may not
[36:31] know it, but do it again.
[36:38] He's always come through for you. He's
[36:43] the same now as then.
[36:48] You may not know how and you may not
[36:52] know it,
[36:56] but I'll do it again.
[37:00] [Music]
[37:26] [Music]
[37:30] Y'all pray for me.
[37:35] I left my home.
[37:37] [Music]
[37:39] I came so far
[37:44] from where I was
[37:46] [Music]
[37:48] to where you are.
[37:52] The bitter tears,
[37:55] [Music]
[37:56] the lonely ache,
[38:01] the many ways
[38:05] a heart can break.
[38:08] [Music]
[38:10] And you were at the center of it all
[38:19] to free you from the prison of the fall.
[38:27] There was no hill
[38:30] too steep for me to climb.
[38:35] No road too long
[38:39] or hard to make you mine.
[38:46] I gave all I had to give and it was
[38:51] worth the cost
[38:55] to say I love you from an old rugged
[39:00] cross.
[39:03] [Music]
[39:04] [Applause]
[39:08] I took your guilt.
[39:10] [Music]
[39:12] I bore your shame.
[39:16] And I would do
[39:20] it all again.
[39:24] My open arms
[39:28] reached out through grace
[39:33] to pull you in
[39:37] through love and praise.
[39:42] It's been spoken in a thousand different
[39:46] ways.
[39:51] Yet the cross said more than words could
[39:54] ever say.
[39:56] [Music]
[39:58] There was no hill
[40:01] too steep for me to climb.
[40:06] No road too long
[40:10] and hard to make you mine.
[40:13] [Music]
[40:16] I gave all I had to give. And it was
[40:21] worth the cost
[40:25] to say I love you from an old
[40:30] cross.
[40:33] [Music]
[40:39] Let's sing this again.
[40:42] I took your gift.
[40:44] [Music]
[40:46] I bore your shame
[40:50] and I would do
[40:54] it all again.
[40:58] My open arms
[41:02] reached out through grace
[41:06] to pull you in
[41:10] through love and grace.
[41:15] It's been spoken in a thousand different
[41:19] ways.
[41:22] [Music]
[41:23] Yet the cross said more than words could
[41:27] ever say.
[41:30] There was no hill
[41:34] too steep for me to climb.
[41:39] No road too long or hard to make you
[41:44] mine.
[41:49] I gave all I had to give and it was
[41:54] worth the cost
[41:58] to say I love you.
[42:02] Oh, how I love you
[42:07] from an old rugged cross.
[42:11] [Music]
[42:21] Amen. How many enjoyed those specials
[42:23] this morning? Amen. We all just stand
[42:26] together. There was one announcement
[42:29] that I forgot to read. Our Fourth of
[42:30] July meetings are less than 3 weeks away
[42:33] and we have begun planning several
[42:35] activities. We need sisters to sign up
[42:37] for kitchen help and brothers to sign up
[42:39] for help in the fellowship hall. 2hour
[42:41] time slots are planned to allow rest
[42:43] time for us to enjoy these special
[42:45] meetings. You may sign up for more if
[42:47] you wish. It is very important. We fill
[42:49] all slots to allow us to do all that is
[42:51] planned. Please sign up ASAP so we can
[42:54] finalize plans. Signup sheets are in the
[42:56] library. Amen. and we'll sing this
[42:58] little course and ask brother Donnie to
[42:59] come and bring us the word of the Lord.
[43:02] Reach out
[43:04] and touch the Lord
[43:08] as he
[43:11] goes by.
[43:14] You'll find
[43:17] he's not too busy
[43:21] to hear your heart's cry.
[43:26] He's passing
[43:29] by this moment
[43:32] your needs.
[43:35] He will supply.
[43:38] Reach out
[43:41] and touch the Lord
[43:45] as he
[43:48] goes by.
[43:50] Oh, reach out
[43:53] and touch the Lord.
[44:03] You'll find
[44:05] he's never too busy
[44:09] to hear your
[44:12] heart's cry.
[44:15] He's passing
[44:18] by this moment.
[44:21] Every need he will supply
[44:26] if you'll reach out.
[44:31] Touch the Lord
[44:33] as he Can we sing it once again? Let's
[44:37] just believe it with all of our hearts.
[44:40] Reach out
[44:42] and touch the Lord.
[44:46] As she
[44:49] goes by,
[44:51] you'll find
[44:54] he's not too busy.
[44:59] Whatever your heart's cries today,
[45:04] oh, he's passing
[45:07] by this moment.
[45:11] Yes, Lord Jesus. He will supply.
[45:16] You'll reach out
[45:19] and touch the Lord
[45:22] as he
[45:25] goes by.
[45:30] [Music]
[45:32] I believe it's just that simple today.
[45:36] No doubt if there would be a scale or a
[45:39] measure by which we would try to weigh
[45:44] every need and every request and every
[45:47] desire.
[45:50] Some might be on the light end. Some
[45:52] might be on the medium end of the scale.
[45:57] Others might be so heavy it would seem
[45:59] that it would bury the needle as far as
[46:02] intensity and how important it is that
[46:06] people be ministered to today. That's
[46:08] one thing we love about our Lord is that
[46:11] whether you're on the light end of the
[46:13] scale today with your burdens or whether
[46:15] you're plum over on the other side and
[46:17] you feel so overloaded
[46:22] and so underprivileged and underst
[46:24] staffed in your walk. He's mindful of
[46:28] every one of them. Yeah. Aren't you glad
[46:30] that's the way he is? How many would
[46:33] like to be remembered today as we as we
[46:35] pray? God bless you.
[46:38] Heavenly Father, we are indeed grateful
[46:41] for the opportunity that once again we
[46:43] could come into your courts with praise
[46:47] and thanksgiving.
[46:49] Your prophet has taught us that whenever
[46:51] we go to prayer that we should start out
[46:55] with a little bit of praise and loving
[46:57] you. Most of us are so busy and we got
[47:00] so much on our schedule and so much
[47:02] we're doing. And I wonder how many times
[47:05] we don't get what we need because we
[47:08] don't follow the divine protocol.
[47:12] We just call always calling on your name
[47:14] in time of urgency and our request. And
[47:18] we should always start out with that.
[47:20] Lord, we love you with all of our hearts
[47:24] today. We've come once again, Father,
[47:26] not just because it's what people do on
[47:29] Sunday, but we have needs, desperate
[47:33] needs, desires.
[47:36] Father, we petition you today, that
[47:39] you'd speak to us. Your prophet has
[47:42] taught us that this is one of the
[47:43] reasons that we come to church is to
[47:45] find our faults, find our shortcomings
[47:48] so we can be helped. I pray that you
[47:51] would take the word today and speak to
[47:52] us. Help me, Lord, that I can get out of
[47:55] the way. In the name of Jesus, we ask
[47:58] it. Amen. God bless you. Let's turn
[48:02] second Peter chapter 1 verse two.
[48:04] Certainly want to say to all of our
[48:07] fathers today, wish you a happy Father's
[48:09] Day. Trust it'll be a good day for you.
[48:13] I certainly wish my father was alive,
[48:16] would you? so we could call him on the
[48:19] phone and tell him how much we love him
[48:22] and appreciate him. So if yours is still
[48:26] where you can, I advise you to do it
[48:28] because one day if he's taken before
[48:31] you, you'll realize all the
[48:33] opportunities that you missed. Little
[48:36] things that cost you absolutely
[48:39] nothing.
[48:42] I've buried many, many people, sat in
[48:45] the funeral homes with them, sat in
[48:48] counsel before the burial and
[48:50] afterwards.
[48:51] And some of the things I've heard of the
[48:53] regrets of people have been so simple.
[48:57] I buried rich people. I buried people
[49:00] that struggle from one paycheck to
[49:02] another.
[49:04] I have never had anyone where they were
[49:07] the ultimate rich or just, you know, did
[49:10] very well,
[49:12] no one to ever tell me, I wish I could
[49:15] have left them another million.
[49:18] I wish I could have done this or I could
[49:20] have done that. But sometimes it's the
[49:22] most simple things. I wish I'd have made
[49:25] more time. I wish instead of buying them
[49:28] $150
[49:30] shoes or, you know, giving them this or
[49:32] that, the other that I would have just
[49:34] let them know verbally,
[49:37] I love you so much.
[49:40] May God help us. I want to be a better
[49:43] person, don't you? Yes. I realize that a
[49:48] lot of people so emphasize on the
[49:50] supernatural in the day that we're
[49:51] living. And I believe in the
[49:54] supernatural myself. As a matter of
[49:55] fact, our God is a supernatural God.
[49:58] But the way I look at supernatural
[50:00] myself and from the scripture and from
[50:02] the message is that supernatural does
[50:05] not just include miracles and healing
[50:08] for the body. Some of the greatest
[50:11] miracles I've ever seen in my life is
[50:14] God healing old wounds
[50:17] that people incurred from parents,
[50:20] grandparents, people they worked with.
[50:23] and it seemed as if though it was a
[50:24] hopeless case. Sometimes people are good
[50:27] in their body, but in their spirit and
[50:29] in their mind, they're really sick.
[50:33] They're really sick. So, may God
[50:35] minister to us today, the whole man. We
[50:39] believe in the full gospel, don't we?
[50:42] Amen. God bless you. Um, Brother Andrew
[50:46] Glover, I heard from him while ago
[50:48] before I come out and he wanted me to
[50:50] greet you all. said he certainly misses
[50:53] getting to be here. Um, so I told him
[50:55] we'd like have to get him back sometime
[50:58] and visit with us. And we certainly love
[50:59] brother Andrew and his family. Second
[51:02] Peter 1:e 2. Remember, we've been
[51:06] speaking now for pretty good while on
[51:09] the right, the bride's bill of rights.
[51:13] And this is one of your rights as a
[51:17] member of the elect body of God is to be
[51:20] built into an image by which God can
[51:24] project his divine presence into you and
[51:28] you become a living tabernacle of the
[51:32] living God.
[51:35] 2 Peter chapter 1:2,
[51:37] "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[51:41] through the knowledge of God and of
[51:43] Jesus our Lord,
[51:46] according as his divine power has given
[51:48] unto us all things that pertain unto
[51:50] life and godliness, through the
[51:53] knowledge of him that hath called us
[51:55] unto glory and virtue." I love that.
[51:59] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[52:02] great and precious promises,
[52:05] that by these great and precious
[52:08] promises, you might be partakers of the
[52:11] divine nature. Now, I mentioned to you
[52:14] last Sunday, many people will stand
[52:16] before the Lord Jesus and they parttook
[52:19] of Holy Ghost power. Paul says in the
[52:22] book of Hebrews that many will of course
[52:24] they'll stand there that day and tasted
[52:27] the good word of God and they even ptook
[52:32] of a portion of the world that is to
[52:36] come
[52:38] and will be lost.
[52:40] So to me reading here what Peter says he
[52:43] doesn't say partakers of miracles or
[52:45] healings and things like that and we we
[52:47] believe in that but we could fall from
[52:49] that. But if we actually partake of the
[52:52] divine nature, here's your seal,
[52:56] brothers and sisters,
[52:58] that we might be partakers of the divine
[53:00] nature, having escaped the corruption
[53:03] that is in the world through lust.
[53:07] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[53:10] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[53:14] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[53:16] to temperance patience. to patience,
[53:19] godliness, to godliness, brotherly
[53:22] kindness, and to brotherly kindness,
[53:25] charity. May the Lord bless his word.
[53:27] You may be seated.
[53:29] Let's read again if you would in verse
[53:31] five. And beside this, giving all
[53:35] diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[53:38] to virtue knowledge. Now, these are the
[53:41] building materials that God is going to
[53:44] build his people out of. And he will
[53:48] build church ages of course which he has
[53:50] and he's building individuals in those
[53:53] church ages out of the same material.
[53:56] This is what we want to look at today by
[53:57] the help of the Lord and to knowledge
[54:00] temperance.
[54:02] Temperance,
[54:04] self-control,
[54:06] the virtue of one who masters his
[54:10] desires
[54:12] and passions,
[54:14] especially his sensual
[54:17] appetites. And notice, he masters them.
[54:22] One who masters them. and to knowledge
[54:28] temperance and to temperance patience
[54:30] and to patience
[54:32] godliness.
[54:34] So then temperance is more than just us
[54:38] trying to uh bring our our temper to
[54:42] where that it's just instead of saying
[54:44] you know really really bad cuss words we
[54:47] just kind of minimize it and we just say
[54:49] milder cuss words or it's instead of us
[54:53] just having a fit you know a temper
[54:55] tantrum or a fit we just u really try to
[54:59] tone it down and and calm it and no
[55:02] actually It's neither one of those. It's
[55:06] by the grace of God controlling it,
[55:09] mastering it. Now, I believe with all of
[55:13] my heart right here today,
[55:16] God will deliver
[55:20] some people in this building if you will
[55:24] open your heart to the word and catch
[55:27] the channel of the spirit of God. Now,
[55:30] maybe it may not be a physical miracle.
[55:32] It may not be a physical healing that
[55:35] you need,
[55:37] but if you one of you today
[55:41] would be able to be delivered from this
[55:44] type of a temper,
[55:46] it will be greater than had your legs
[55:50] been lame and you could not walk and you
[55:54] walked out of here. Or if you had one
[55:56] blinded eye and God opened that eye and
[56:00] you saw or one ear or both was totally
[56:05] deaf and God opened them because this is
[56:09] something Peter never said now add to
[56:12] your lame legs open blinded eyes and
[56:16] then after you have open blinded eyes
[56:18] and add that to your ability to dance
[56:21] and scream and holler and shout and we
[56:23] we believe in all that don't
[56:26] I said, "Don't we?" But that's not what
[56:29] God is building you out of as an
[56:32] individual. It's not the supernatural
[56:35] realm. And you see, because many people
[56:37] have the first level of the foundation,
[56:40] which is faith. That's what they
[56:43] emphasize on. You want me tell you why?
[56:45] Because it's much easier to emphasize on
[56:48] faith that you have than temperance
[56:51] which you don't have. So, it's much
[56:53] easier for us to look at what God's been
[56:55] able to do for us and through our lives.
[56:58] And praise God, I I man, I'm really
[57:01] moving up there. And how many years have
[57:03] you been on faith? Oh, yeah. How many
[57:06] years have you been on the second virtue
[57:08] or maybe on the third? But you see, for
[57:10] us, all seven of these are required for
[57:15] a body change. It's more serious than
[57:19] what we take it to be. Notice we'll go
[57:21] back to this again. The statue of a
[57:23] perfect man. We come to temperance now
[57:25] and you've had faith first. And you have
[57:27] to have that to begin with. Then you add
[57:30] virtue to your faith. If it's the right
[57:32] kind of virtue. So there's two kinds of
[57:34] virtue. Two kinds of faith. Two kinds of
[57:36] temperance. Knowledge. All that. Two
[57:37] kinds of remember that. If it's the
[57:39] right kind of virtue, then you add
[57:41] knowledge. If it's the right kind of
[57:42] knowledge. Now you're going to add
[57:45] temperance. And temperance doesn't mean
[57:48] stop drinking alcohol here either. No.
[57:50] No, temperance doesn't mean alcoholic
[57:52] cure. Not in this case. This is Bible
[57:55] temperance, Holy Spirit temperance.
[57:58] That's just one of the lusts of the
[58:00] flesh. But we're talking about Holy
[58:02] Spirit temperance. That means how to
[58:06] control your tongue.
[58:09] Amen. Not be a tadler.
[58:13] How to control your temper.
[58:17] not fly off
[58:19] every time anybody speaks cross to you.
[58:23] Oh my boy, a lot of us are going to fall
[58:26] off before we get started, aren't we?
[58:30] Then we wonder why God's not in his
[58:33] church doing miracles and things that he
[58:37] used to do. Now, I find this quote
[58:39] amazing because the greatest miracles
[58:43] are happening. This is 1962 that has
[58:46] ever been in the church in its entire
[58:49] history. It's going on around the world
[58:53] and not only in brother Adam's ministry
[58:54] and TA Osborne's ministry. AA Allen's
[58:57] going wide open. Many brothers all over
[58:59] the world revival fires were burning and
[59:02] people were being healed. My goodness,
[59:05] in the Philippines and Jamaica,
[59:07] everywhere by this time frame. If you've
[59:09] never studied the revival during this
[59:11] time frame, none of us have ever seen
[59:14] anything like what was going on. But I
[59:16] wonder, is he talking about the kind of
[59:18] miracles we think?
[59:21] Or is he talking about the miraculous
[59:24] chains of a soul and a makeup of a human
[59:29] being that seems more impossible to cure
[59:34] than a cancer? Amen.
[59:37] Do you understand? Temper can be worse
[59:41] than a cancer. Cancer cannot caner your
[59:47] soul
[59:49] in hell,
[59:52] but temper
[59:54] can.
[59:56] Preach it, brother. Go ahead. Amen.
[1:00:01] Amen.
[1:00:03] Amen. Now, let's look at Moses today.
[1:00:06] How many believes he was a great prophet
[1:00:07] of God? But Moses
[1:00:11] had a problem.
[1:00:13] Moses had a temper and it was a bad one.
[1:00:18] And as a matter of fact, it finally kept
[1:00:20] him out of the promised land.
[1:00:23] Notice a prophet in dealing with Moses.
[1:00:25] He said he was born in this world to be
[1:00:27] a deliverer just like Christ and all how
[1:00:30] his work and how he was a lawgiver. Went
[1:00:32] up to the mountains and stayed 40 days,
[1:00:34] come back out with the law. His
[1:00:37] besetting sin
[1:00:39] was temper.
[1:00:42] Wow. A prophet of God.
[1:00:45] A prophet that could strike the rock. A
[1:00:48] prophet that could do miraculous and
[1:00:50] signs and wonders. But what's amazing
[1:00:53] was he could do all of this supernatural
[1:00:56] outside of his own being. And none of
[1:00:58] that none of that was what kept him out
[1:01:01] of the promised land or gave him the
[1:01:04] right of passage
[1:01:07] because you smoke the rock and water can
[1:01:09] came out. You can come on in because you
[1:01:12] call for lice and frogs and and plagues
[1:01:15] and pestilence. I'll overlook your human
[1:01:18] makeup and I'll let you come on in
[1:01:20] because you've had such phenomenal
[1:01:22] miracles. Nobody's ever done what you
[1:01:25] ever done.
[1:01:28] But God would not let Moses go into the
[1:01:30] promised land because he had such a
[1:01:33] violent temper.
[1:01:36] Amen.
[1:01:37] Oh my. Now notice his besetting sin was
[1:01:41] temper. He broke the commandment, went
[1:01:44] back up, showing that that priesthood
[1:01:46] must die and pass away. And you know,
[1:01:50] did you ever study that right close?
[1:01:52] Moses had a temper, you know, that
[1:01:54] finally kept him out
[1:01:59] of the promised land,
[1:02:02] his
[1:02:04] temper.
[1:02:08] God, speak to us today.
[1:02:11] Now let's look at it
[1:02:14] naturally. Let's look at it medically,
[1:02:18] psychologically also. I put this up here
[1:02:22] so you could read it with me. Anger is
[1:02:25] part of the fight, freeze or flight
[1:02:30] response
[1:02:32] in which the adrenals, the adrenal
[1:02:35] glands flood the body with stress
[1:02:38] hormones.
[1:02:41] Most of us have got so many stress
[1:02:42] hormones and our body is like drinking
[1:02:44] coffee and Kool-Aid in the day we live.
[1:02:48] Now notice what it does. This is your
[1:02:50] makeup. God knowing after the fall that
[1:02:54] we would need this in our makeup. It it
[1:02:58] it's amazing to me. It's fight, freeze,
[1:03:03] or flight. All of us, no doubt, if
[1:03:06] you're at least 2 minutes old, have
[1:03:09] experienced this. So when circumstances
[1:03:12] will happen that we we fight or we
[1:03:17] freeze, we just don't know what to do
[1:03:19] for a few moments or flight. We just
[1:03:23] take off running. We we just don't know
[1:03:24] what to do. Now watch what is happening
[1:03:27] inside of our body is amazing thing
[1:03:31] because these adrenal glands and our
[1:03:34] body are releasing hormones as
[1:03:39] adrenaline and cortisol. We experience
[1:03:43] physiological effects like an increased
[1:03:47] heart rate and blood pressure rapidly
[1:03:51] pushing blood to the heart. The body is
[1:03:54] physically preparing to fight to defend
[1:03:57] itself or flee from danger. But now we
[1:04:01] were designed even after the fall to
[1:04:04] only experience so much release of this
[1:04:08] and our body at any given time which
[1:04:12] would come momentarily whenever we would
[1:04:15] need it. And then the adrenal glands
[1:04:17] would stop permeating our body with this
[1:04:20] and then our body would start calming
[1:04:22] down. Then the body would process this
[1:04:25] and do something with these hormones.
[1:04:29] But I want you to listen what anger does
[1:04:32] and temper.
[1:04:34] Experiencing anger triggers the body to
[1:04:37] release stress hormones which over time
[1:04:44] can take a toll on your heart health.
[1:04:48] Isn't that amazing?
[1:04:50] So we quit eating certain foods, we
[1:04:54] exercise, we do all kinds of things for
[1:04:57] our heart health and killing oursel with
[1:05:01] temper and anger.
[1:05:04] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amens aren't
[1:05:07] expected, but they are appreciated.
[1:05:11] I had a few people after the service
[1:05:13] last week. They was texting amen while I
[1:05:16] was preaching because I couldn't be here
[1:05:17] at church. I didn't get it as delayed.
[1:05:19] Brother Phillip, I didn't get it till
[1:05:20] after I walked back around in the
[1:05:21] office. But I appreciated somebody at
[1:05:23] least text me. You know, now notice
[1:05:26] research shows that anger, even
[1:05:29] momentary anger measured by changes in
[1:05:33] facial expression,
[1:05:35] results in changes in the heart that wor
[1:05:38] worsen the muscle's ability, the heart
[1:05:41] muscle to pump blood, which can lead to
[1:05:46] high blood pressure,
[1:05:48] which of course then we go to the doctor
[1:05:50] and they put us on high blood pressure
[1:05:52] pills.
[1:05:56] But let me not recommend that you call
[1:05:58] your physician tomorrow,
[1:06:01] but let me recommend that you go to the
[1:06:03] very cause for some of you what's
[1:06:06] causing your blood pressure to be so
[1:06:08] high.
[1:06:10] Now watch, it can lead to high blood
[1:06:13] pressure and subsequent complications
[1:06:16] like heart disease.
[1:06:19] Oh my. heart attack,
[1:06:23] stroke,
[1:06:25] metabolic
[1:06:26] syndrome.
[1:06:29] So you quit eating fats, and you're my
[1:06:34] you're so heart conscience and eat
[1:06:36] Cheerios till you become a walking
[1:06:38] Cheerio and a bowl of oatmeal
[1:06:42] cuz you're so worried about your heart
[1:06:45] and get madder than a hornet.
[1:06:49] and let that stuff run through your body
[1:06:51] and do more damage than a truckload of
[1:06:54] Hostess Twinkies
[1:06:56] dipped in vanilla ice cream.
[1:07:00] Oh, but you watch that weight and you
[1:07:03] watch them carbs and you watch this and
[1:07:06] that and the devil is pulling one over
[1:07:08] on you. Amen. By your temper and your
[1:07:12] anger. Amen. Amen, brother. Praise the
[1:07:16] Lord. Research accordingly shows that
[1:07:19] people with higher anger, those who tend
[1:07:23] to perceive
[1:07:25] situations as hostile and are less
[1:07:28] capable of controlling their hostile
[1:07:31] thoughts and feelings are at greater
[1:07:35] risk of coronary
[1:07:38] heart disease.
[1:07:40] Boy, we preach on people for smoking,
[1:07:44] man. We'll preach on them for drinking.
[1:07:47] We'll preach on them and we'll look down
[1:07:49] our big long crooked nose at anybody
[1:07:51] that don't do this and that and the
[1:07:53] other. Take care of yourself, brother.
[1:07:55] Your body is a house of God. Shame on
[1:07:58] you. Spitting that amir out on the on
[1:08:00] the parking lot out there. My walked in
[1:08:03] here with that old stinking cigarette
[1:08:05] smoke all over your clothes and all the
[1:08:07] rest of us glorified holy saints have to
[1:08:11] say you're nearly choked to death. Oh
[1:08:13] my. And you get so mad it feels like
[1:08:17] your heart's going to explode.
[1:08:20] You are a hypocrite. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:08:26] Amen, brother. Preach it now. Amen.
[1:08:32] I'm not sure how many parts you're going
[1:08:34] to have on this temperance, but I figure
[1:08:36] if there's many more, if there's another
[1:08:37] Sunday or two, y'all going to come in.
[1:08:39] You're dressed up like football people.
[1:08:41] helmet on, pads, you know, all that sort
[1:08:43] of thing because you're thinking, "Oh,
[1:08:45] Lord have mercy."
[1:08:47] Another study found that higher trait
[1:08:49] anger was also linked to higher risk of
[1:08:54] deaths
[1:08:58] from coronary heart disease
[1:09:01] and complications.
[1:09:06] Evidence also suggests that anger is
[1:09:09] specifically linked to higher risk
[1:09:14] of heart attacks.
[1:09:16] Welcome to the real world.
[1:09:24] And you talking about a miracle from God
[1:09:27] that God right here in this service
[1:09:29] today could deliver people whether
[1:09:32] they're visible or streaming
[1:09:35] and deliver them from temper and anger
[1:09:38] that is so severe that will take them to
[1:09:42] a premature grave
[1:09:46] if they don't get it stopped. Amen.
[1:09:51] I'll let you ponder on that before I
[1:09:52] read it to you.
[1:09:56] In a systematic review that looked to
[1:09:59] studies with a total of nearly 4,000
[1:10:02] participants for from more than 40
[1:10:05] medical centers in the United States.
[1:10:07] Researchers found a more than twofold
[1:10:10] increase in heart attacks
[1:10:14] within two hours
[1:10:17] after an anger
[1:10:20] outburst.
[1:10:24] Anybody know who the first person was
[1:10:27] mentioned in the Bible that displayed
[1:10:30] anger like this?
[1:10:34] Cain.
[1:10:35] Yes, he is. Why art thou so ros and why
[1:10:41] is thy countenance fallen?
[1:10:45] Now, he's the first one to experience
[1:10:48] this type of anger. Now, think of it.
[1:10:50] Adam never experienced this and Abel
[1:10:54] never experienced. We have no written
[1:10:56] scriptures that Ces ever did. But after
[1:11:00] Genesis 6, then this become bred in the
[1:11:04] human DNA gene pool.
[1:11:09] And also by nature which can be
[1:11:12] inherited from parents, grandparents,
[1:11:16] aunts, uncles. Boy, did we get a lot
[1:11:18] from our family.
[1:11:21] Now seeing what this can do to an
[1:11:23] individual. So within this was a
[1:11:26] research out of over 4,000 people and 50
[1:11:29] different medical centers in the United
[1:11:31] States and then they traced it back to
[1:11:34] people who had a big temper fit twice as
[1:11:37] many heart attacks. This suggests more
[1:11:41] intense anger is indeed worse for your
[1:11:44] heart. The researchers noted anger can
[1:11:47] also disrupt your digestion. Much
[1:11:51] research shows that the brain and the
[1:11:54] gut are in constant communication
[1:11:57] and influence each other. Wow. We could
[1:12:02] enjoy our dinner a lot better, I guess,
[1:12:03] if we had the right thinking, couldn't
[1:12:05] we? Amen. You see, also too much anger
[1:12:09] hinders our mental health. Oh, seemed
[1:12:14] like I remember reading to you last
[1:12:17] week, did I not? that God's prophet said
[1:12:20] that anger and temper is the first stage
[1:12:24] of insanity. Of course, he was saying
[1:12:26] this before this article was written.
[1:12:31] They'll eventually catch up if time goes
[1:12:33] on.
[1:12:35] Being in a state of anger strains can
[1:12:38] take a toll too on mental health.
[1:12:41] Studies show that anger is often
[1:12:44] elevated in emotional disorders such as
[1:12:49] anxiety and depression and is associated
[1:12:53] with both worse symptoms and a lesser
[1:12:56] response to treatment. Anger, especially
[1:13:00] prolonged anger, can also affect our
[1:13:04] concentration
[1:13:06] and thinking patterns. It can make us
[1:13:09] more hostile or cynical,
[1:13:13] which can take a toll on our
[1:13:16] relationships.
[1:13:18] Oh, wow. And ability to form bonds. All
[1:13:22] of this can certainly be damaging to our
[1:13:25] well-being. Now, remember, this is not
[1:13:28] from the Church of God seminary. This is
[1:13:30] not from the Assembly of God. This is
[1:13:33] not even from your message. This is just
[1:13:36] medical science. And you can pull part
[1:13:38] of it up just like I did by doing an AI
[1:13:41] search if you'd like to. So this is what
[1:13:44] they are saying out here. And yet God's
[1:13:47] prophet was saying it decades ago and
[1:13:51] warning us. But remember, he's not just
[1:13:53] preaching it for those that God would
[1:13:56] show him had a temper, but he's
[1:13:58] preaching it from a firsthand
[1:14:00] experience.
[1:14:02] since he ate most of his meals when he
[1:14:06] was a young boy through a straw.
[1:14:14] Come on. Now, I realize you won't hear
[1:14:16] these things preached by a lot of
[1:14:18] preachers and a lot of people because
[1:14:19] they want to make Brother Brandham an
[1:14:21] idol. He was not an idol. He was a man
[1:14:24] who need to be saved. He was a man who
[1:14:27] needed the Holy Ghost. He was a man who
[1:14:30] needed to be delivered of such a temper.
[1:14:34] And the church said, "I personally can
[1:14:37] follow a man like that." What about you?
[1:14:39] I can follow a man that can stand up and
[1:14:40] be honest and tell us that he had need
[1:14:43] of God in his life. Now watch. It can
[1:14:47] make us more hostile or cynical and can
[1:14:50] take a toll on our relationships and
[1:14:52] ability to form bonds. All of this can
[1:14:55] certainly be damaging to well-being. Our
[1:14:57] anger reactions can cause harm to our
[1:15:01] most important
[1:15:04] relationships. Now, this is quoting here
[1:15:05] a doctor of the specialty of this. This
[1:15:07] guy's name was Tarfrey. Humans are
[1:15:10] social creatures and we need social
[1:15:14] connections to thrive.
[1:15:17] But you know what I find amazing is that
[1:15:19] Satan will find Christians my much more
[1:15:22] about this than he will even worldly
[1:15:24] people and get you at odds with people
[1:15:27] you go to church with. Well, I ain't
[1:15:29] having no fellowship with nobody. I
[1:15:30] can't get along with this person. I
[1:15:32] can't get along with that. I'll tell you
[1:15:33] everybody at the church. It must be
[1:15:35] everybody else. Uh you might ought to
[1:15:38] look inward. You might ought to look at
[1:15:40] yourself a little bit in the mirror. You
[1:15:42] might find a guilty party when you're
[1:15:44] combing your hair and brushing your
[1:15:46] teeth.
[1:15:48] Praise the Lord. You see the physical
[1:15:51] impact, stress response, high temper
[1:15:54] often leads to increased stress levels.
[1:15:57] Well, isn't that nice? So, the more
[1:16:00] angry we get, the more stress we create.
[1:16:06] God, we need some temper miracles. Amen.
[1:16:10] We need some stress relief miracles.
[1:16:15] Ah, but I figure that even if we had a
[1:16:17] whole bunch here today, a lot of folks
[1:16:19] wouldn't turn in a praise testimony.
[1:16:22] Well, glory to God. I want to thank the
[1:16:24] Lord. He delivered me last Sunday from
[1:16:26] temper. I used to do this and I used to
[1:16:28] do that. Glory to God. I don't do it no
[1:16:30] more. We're so afraid somebody will
[1:16:32] think less of us. Well, why don't we be
[1:16:34] real? Just real real plain and honest
[1:16:36] with one another today. There ain't a
[1:16:38] person here that don't need some help
[1:16:39] from God. I'm talking about even the man
[1:16:42] in the pull pit preaching to you today.
[1:16:44] This is why we come to the house of God.
[1:16:47] It's not a social place whether we
[1:16:49] gather together and we'll fix up a few
[1:16:51] hot dogs and a few hamburgers and French
[1:16:54] fries and we'll see how we can talk
[1:16:56] about our business. Our souls are at
[1:16:59] stake, friends.
[1:17:03] Oh my.
[1:17:05] Now notice what it does. So it leads to
[1:17:08] increased stress levels which can
[1:17:10] elevate blood pressure and heart rate.
[1:17:13] Inflammation.
[1:17:15] Inflammation. Chronic anger and
[1:17:18] irritability
[1:17:19] may contribute to inflammation
[1:17:22] linked to conditions like heart disease
[1:17:26] and diabetes.
[1:17:29] Immune function. Persistive negative
[1:17:34] emotions can weaken weaken
[1:17:37] the immune system, making individuals
[1:17:41] more susceptible to illnesses.
[1:17:46] And you'll take vitamin A and B and C
[1:17:49] and D on down to Z plus to boost your
[1:17:54] immune system.
[1:17:58] And one of the greatest greatest things
[1:18:00] you can do is put a smile on your face
[1:18:04] and be happy.
[1:18:08] Now, if you're low on A, take it. If
[1:18:09] you're low on D, take it. But a lot of
[1:18:11] us are are low on H, happy.
[1:18:15] Amen. We're low on happy. We're low on
[1:18:19] J, joy. We're low on P, peace. Come on,
[1:18:23] somebody.
[1:18:25] Hallelujah.
[1:18:27] Notice anxiety and depression. Frequent
[1:18:30] anger can correlate with higher rates of
[1:18:33] anxiety and depression. Coping
[1:18:35] mechanisms. Individuals with a quick
[1:18:38] temper may resort to unhealthy coping
[1:18:42] strategies
[1:18:43] such as substance abuse.
[1:18:47] Now, I want you to listen at this
[1:18:48] statement that was made in April the
[1:18:52] 5th, 1956.
[1:18:55] God
[1:18:57] don't want you to be frowned.
[1:19:02] Let your face know that this morning,
[1:19:04] please.
[1:19:06] God don't want you to be frowning. God
[1:19:09] wants you to be happy.
[1:19:14] The human heart was made to be happy.
[1:19:20] And word of life church says
[1:19:23] worry
[1:19:26] will cause
[1:19:30] what
[1:19:37] temper.
[1:19:43] Temper will cause
[1:19:47] cancer.
[1:19:50] And some of you are terrified with
[1:19:52] carcens and you're terrified with eating
[1:19:54] so much meat that's cooked on the grill
[1:19:56] because you saw some YouTube nut that
[1:19:59] was coming on there said don't eat that
[1:20:00] and don't do that and don't do that and
[1:20:03] don't use plastic bowls and don't use
[1:20:05] this and don't use that. Time they get
[1:20:07] done you can't even breathe.
[1:20:10] But I'm time a bunch of these nuts and
[1:20:12] you'll sit there and ridicule a preacher
[1:20:14] that's trying to bring you a better life
[1:20:18] and fill your life with a bunch of nigh
[1:20:20] heads on YouTube so you can be healthy.
[1:20:29] My goodness.
[1:20:32] Worry will cause cancer.
[1:20:37] Is there anybody here honest enough
[1:20:38] today that'll raise your hand and say
[1:20:40] you need to be a more worry-free
[1:20:43] Christian?
[1:20:46] I'd get the other one up here if I could
[1:20:47] so all four will be up at one time. Tell
[1:20:50] me what is worry done for any of us.
[1:20:56] Worry causes cancer.
[1:20:59] Temper
[1:21:01] causes cancer.
[1:21:06] Don't never be upset. Now, I don't mind
[1:21:10] tell you them is some short little
[1:21:12] simple words, but I need help with that.
[1:21:18] Don't never be upset. Just walk in his
[1:21:21] love. Amen. Knowing that you're walking
[1:21:25] in him and nothing
[1:21:29] can harm you.
[1:21:32] I guess the question is, do we believe
[1:21:34] this part of the message or do we not?
[1:21:38] Watch the social consequences of this
[1:21:41] relationships. A volatile temper can
[1:21:44] strain personal and professional
[1:21:46] relationships leading to social
[1:21:50] isolation.
[1:21:51] Work environment. Anger can affect
[1:21:54] workplace dynamics potentially resulting
[1:21:58] in conflicts
[1:22:00] and reduced productivity.
[1:22:04] Wow. Sound like to me tempers been a lot
[1:22:06] of our problems.
[1:22:09] Like it's a lot of the world's problems.
[1:22:11] We we we should be able to say amen to
[1:22:13] this since our country is rocking this
[1:22:15] weekend over riots and all types of bomb
[1:22:19] threats and cars being burned, homes
[1:22:21] being destroyed. Come on, church. All
[1:22:24] over America, from the west coast to the
[1:22:27] e east coast. Some of our saints that
[1:22:29] was traveling back from a trip wasn't
[1:22:31] even sure if they was going to be able
[1:22:33] to get home because of bomb threats on
[1:22:36] planes, bomb threats in airports. The
[1:22:39] Marines have been called out. The
[1:22:40] National Guard are being called out.
[1:22:43] Policemen are being hit. State troopers
[1:22:46] are being hit with rocks. Anybody seen
[1:22:48] the news today? They're burning cars.
[1:22:51] are destroying buildings. What is it?
[1:22:53] Worry free. I don't think they're worry
[1:22:56] free and they're wanting to say we don't
[1:22:58] we don't have no king. Well, we do.
[1:23:01] We've got one king and that ain't Trump.
[1:23:03] It's King Jesus.
[1:23:05] But I'll tell you one thing, they're not
[1:23:07] displaying what this country was founded
[1:23:10] upon. Come on, somebody. And are they
[1:23:12] going to be more happy when they do like
[1:23:15] this? No. I'll tell you what's going to
[1:23:16] happen. There will be more stress.
[1:23:18] There'll be more doctor visits. It would
[1:23:21] be interesting to see after people get
[1:23:23] out there and act like a bunch of
[1:23:25] idiots, how many of them will wind up
[1:23:27] going to the ER. How many of them will
[1:23:29] wind up not because they got hit in the
[1:23:31] head with a police baton, but because
[1:23:33] they release so much cortisol and so
[1:23:36] much stress hormones in their body,
[1:23:38] they'll have heart attacks. But I'll
[1:23:40] tell you what you and I need to do. We
[1:23:42] need to hide in the blood of the Lord
[1:23:45] Jesus and say, "Lead me to the rock that
[1:23:49] is higher than high." All we see around
[1:23:52] us is stress and trouble. But I believe
[1:23:55] children of God can still have a happy
[1:23:58] life, a peaceful life, full of joy, full
[1:24:01] of power, full of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:24:04] look at the devil and say, "Devil, you
[1:24:06] ain't controlling my joy. Devil, you
[1:24:09] ain't controlling my peace. These are
[1:24:12] your people, but I'm not one of your
[1:24:14] people.
[1:24:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:18] [Applause]
[1:24:26] You know, I was telling the boys a while
[1:24:28] ago coming over,
[1:24:31] I said, "You know how we must be happy
[1:24:35] all the time?"
[1:24:37] God don't want you to be sad. You know
[1:24:39] what illtemper does? What that old
[1:24:42] temper, that's one of the awstickness
[1:24:53] is temper.
[1:24:57] Oh, but no, brother D. Mine's blood
[1:24:59] pressure and mine's mental instability
[1:25:01] and mine's this and mine's that. Are you
[1:25:02] sure?
[1:25:07] Or is it that furnace inside of you? And
[1:25:11] when somebody says something to you just
[1:25:13] like that, you lose that temper. Your
[1:25:16] face gets red.
[1:25:19] Depends on your makeup. Some when they
[1:25:21] get that way, their top lip starts
[1:25:23] quivering.
[1:25:26] I've dealt with a few Christians that
[1:25:28] way and I knew I was really getting on
[1:25:30] their toes and they could hold or try to
[1:25:33] hold it down. You know, nobody won't see
[1:25:35] it. Nothing.
[1:25:36] them and then
[1:25:40] you need a miracle.
[1:25:43] You need a miracle. Anybody here today
[1:25:46] say, "God, I need a miracle.
[1:25:52] You've come to the right place.
[1:25:55] He sent his word
[1:25:58] and heals him."
[1:26:04] Listen to this. About 60% of all cause
[1:26:06] of all sickness is temper. Yes, sir.
[1:26:09] Tantrums. You fly loose. Remember,
[1:26:12] you're just developing a cancer
[1:26:17] ulcer or something like that. When you
[1:26:19] do it, when you get all stowed up about
[1:26:22] somebody and I won't go back there
[1:26:23] anymore. Oh, but we scream about the
[1:26:26] seven thunders and we shout about all
[1:26:29] the message. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:26:31] Oh, the message, the seven seal, man.
[1:26:34] We've got more than anybody else does.
[1:26:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:42] If we do not meet this standard,
[1:26:47] we will miss the rapture
[1:26:50] just like the rest of the church systems
[1:26:54] out here in the world.
[1:26:57] Amen. Your long hair will be worthless.
[1:27:01] Wearing your dresses, your brothers not
[1:27:03] looking like sissies, and being perverts
[1:27:06] will amount to nothing.
[1:27:09] That's right. If we are not made into
[1:27:11] the image
[1:27:13] of the living God,
[1:27:20] when you get all stood up about
[1:27:21] somebody, I won't go back there anymore.
[1:27:24] Wait, I'll give them a piece of my mind.
[1:27:27] If I was you, I'd keep all the pieces
[1:27:29] you have. You're probably going to need
[1:27:31] it.
[1:27:34] Remember,
[1:27:36] you're the one that's going to pay for
[1:27:38] it.
[1:27:41] Just keep
[1:27:44] happy.
[1:27:48] Notice the church in this condition. The
[1:27:49] first time you get one of those little
[1:27:51] temper spasms,
[1:27:54] the dove flies right away.
[1:27:58] That's right.
[1:28:00] She can't stand it.
[1:28:03] I find this amazing that he would use
[1:28:05] the feminist gender to describe the
[1:28:08] spirit of God.
[1:28:11] She can't stand it. Her nature's
[1:28:15] different.
[1:28:17] She can't stand that at all. And you go
[1:28:19] to talking about your neighbor,
[1:28:23] she can't stand that.
[1:28:25] Come on.
[1:28:28] She just won't put up with it.
[1:28:32] He just takes his flight.
[1:28:35] Wow.
[1:28:38] Can't you see how Christ
[1:28:40] and the bride are both identified in
[1:28:42] this manifestation?
[1:28:44] She, she, she, and then he,
[1:28:49] the real bride, come from the same
[1:28:52] source as he did. That's right. Amen.
[1:28:57] Notice again lifting him up out of
[1:28:58] history. I found this yesterday. I
[1:29:00] thought, "Oh my goodness." I just
[1:29:02] thought it was such a phenomenal quote.
[1:29:05] A Methodist God, a Baptist God, a
[1:29:10] Presbyterian God,
[1:29:13] a Pentecostal God.
[1:29:17] They won't work.
[1:29:19] Get the God of this Bible.
[1:29:23] A Pentecostal God will go right out in
[1:29:27] the world. Amen.
[1:29:30] But the God of the Bible will make you
[1:29:35] like Jesus.
[1:29:38] He sure will. His spirit will dwell in
[1:29:40] you. All your life will be changed. That
[1:29:43] temper, that malice, that unforgiving
[1:29:46] spirit, that thing, it'll caner your
[1:29:51] soul
[1:29:53] in a lost
[1:29:56] eternity.
[1:30:01] He didn't mention adultery and we know
[1:30:03] that well,
[1:30:05] drinking.
[1:30:07] temper
[1:30:09] caner canker your soul
[1:30:15] in a lost eternity.
[1:30:19] Why, brother Donnie?
[1:30:21] Because temper of this type
[1:30:24] is of the devil,
[1:30:27] not of God. That's right. It is satanic,
[1:30:31] friends.
[1:30:35] And some of you have tried your whole
[1:30:36] life to subject it.
[1:30:40] But if you're dealing with something of
[1:30:42] this type right here, let me just go
[1:30:43] ahead and tell you, it's greater than
[1:30:46] you. Amen.
[1:30:49] But I believe our God is here to deliver
[1:30:51] today.
[1:30:56] That temper, that malice, that
[1:30:58] unforgiving spirit, that thing, it'll
[1:31:01] caner your soul.
[1:31:04] and a lost eternity.
[1:31:08] Now watch this. In faith is the v our
[1:31:09] victory. Dear God, we would ask thy
[1:31:11] divine mercy upon these waiting penitent
[1:31:13] souls who believe that you are a reward
[1:31:15] of those who diligently seek after thee.
[1:31:17] And I would ask you to be merciful in
[1:31:19] them, Lord. And and whatever there is,
[1:31:23] listen at the different cancers.
[1:31:27] The cancer of doubt,
[1:31:32] the cancer
[1:31:34] of temper,
[1:31:38] the cancer, you mean doubt. It's like a
[1:31:42] cancer. And what does a cancer do? It
[1:31:44] says one thing about the cells that so
[1:31:46] far they've not been able to to switch
[1:31:48] it off. All the rest of the cells of our
[1:31:50] bodies, they have an off and on switch
[1:31:53] and they don't just constantly make make
[1:31:56] but there's a shut off and the body, you
[1:31:57] know, regulates all that by the divine
[1:31:59] creator. But with cancer cells, they
[1:32:02] just keep multiplying, multiplying,
[1:32:04] multiplying, multiplying. That's why it
[1:32:06] takes over the human body.
[1:32:09] And so far, they've not been able to
[1:32:11] figure out the trigger of it to be able
[1:32:13] to shut it down. if they could ever shut
[1:32:15] down that trigger and kill those live
[1:32:18] cells that never reproduce again.
[1:32:21] And he would use these words to describe
[1:32:24] doubt
[1:32:25] as it being a cancer. So what does it
[1:32:27] do? It grows in a person's heart, in a
[1:32:30] person's mind. God don't love me. God
[1:32:32] don't care for me. God won't move for
[1:32:33] me. And then it'll keep growing and
[1:32:35] growing and growing because that little
[1:32:37] switch is not shut off. God will send an
[1:32:39] evangelist by this. Well, I don't know.
[1:32:41] I don't know. I think he was speaking to
[1:32:43] me, but I'm not sure. God will have the
[1:32:45] pastor to speak. And I I don't know. I
[1:32:47] don't know why. Because that cell there,
[1:32:50] that spiritual cell does not want you to
[1:32:52] hear the word, which will reach over
[1:32:54] there and turn that switch off and that
[1:32:56] doubt will die. So what's the doubt do?
[1:32:58] It keeps multiplying, multiplying,
[1:33:00] growing, growing.
[1:33:04] Now look at temper.
[1:33:06] the cancer
[1:33:09] of temper, the malignancy
[1:33:13] of unbelief.
[1:33:15] Take it out just now, Lord,
[1:33:19] and give them the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:23] Fill their soul with your goodness.
[1:33:25] Baptize them into thy kingdom
[1:33:28] just now.
[1:33:32] Notice again he said you got a temper
[1:33:35] and that just makes you fly loose.
[1:33:37] That's the devil.
[1:33:40] He bites you. He bites you.
[1:33:45] Jesus.
[1:33:47] He will poison
[1:33:49] your experience.
[1:33:52] It's like sulfuric acid.
[1:33:56] It'll kill you
[1:34:00] and you'll be lost.
[1:34:06] Friends, don't be proud of this.
[1:34:10] Don't look at your temperance. It's
[1:34:12] something to brag about. It is not.
[1:34:18] It will kill you
[1:34:21] and you will be lost.
[1:34:30] You'd be surprised at the preachers in
[1:34:31] this message
[1:34:33] that have such a temper. I deal with
[1:34:36] them. I know around the world.
[1:34:39] You disagree with them. Boy, they'll get
[1:34:41] in the pullpit and they'll hammer you.
[1:34:42] They'll get mad on a hornet.
[1:34:47] And preach and shout and jump and run.
[1:34:49] Talk about miracles.
[1:34:52] Why? foundation of faith. But you see,
[1:34:55] we got to keep on climbing. We got to
[1:34:57] keep on climbing.
[1:35:00] Some of you wonder why you've never gone
[1:35:02] any farther than God. It seemed like
[1:35:04] you've reached the spot. Maybe this is
[1:35:06] it right here for some of you.
[1:35:11] I know it's not for everybody. I know
[1:35:12] that. I realize that. But I've got to
[1:35:15] preach what God puts on my heart. So, if
[1:35:17] there'll be one person here today
[1:35:18] that'll receive a miracle from this,
[1:35:20] will you all tolerate me? Will you all
[1:35:23] tolerate the service?
[1:35:30] Oh, God.
[1:35:34] Now, watch this. In in a discernment
[1:35:35] here, the the lady sincerely confessed
[1:35:39] and she said she has a spirit on her of
[1:35:42] high temper. And we realize that's
[1:35:45] that's not nice.
[1:35:47] That's a nice way to say that it wasn't
[1:35:49] nice, was it? That's not nice. But
[1:35:51] sister, not only you, but there's plenty
[1:35:53] of us in here, and maybe some might not
[1:35:55] be as honest to confess it. But he that
[1:35:57] will confess his sins, he that will hide
[1:35:58] his sins will not prosper. But he that
[1:36:00] will confess his sins shall find mercy.
[1:36:02] You know that. So I pray, heavenly
[1:36:04] father,
[1:36:08] bow your hands on sister
[1:36:14] that this temporal believer
[1:36:18] may it never bother her again
[1:36:22] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:26] Bless you sister.
[1:36:31] A man by discernment. Our heavenly
[1:36:32] father realizing that we never know what
[1:36:35] time our hearts going to stop.
[1:36:38] It might at any minute
[1:36:41] and brother
[1:36:44] brother do you notice it's parallel not
[1:36:46] not even the same place but he could
[1:36:48] call the one sister and they call the
[1:36:50] brother not a brother or my brother but
[1:36:52] brother but brother
[1:36:56] has heart trouble and with a temper
[1:37:00] that could cause him to fly into
[1:37:03] tantrums
[1:37:06] that devil would like to take him to a
[1:37:09] premature
[1:37:12] grave
[1:37:15] and not by drinking,
[1:37:18] not by robbing a bank, running around
[1:37:20] with another man's wife,
[1:37:23] but by having heart trouble. Now, notice
[1:37:25] here the prophet is identifying this
[1:37:28] temper with heart trouble before all
[1:37:31] these studies and before all the
[1:37:33] research of all these clinics.
[1:37:37] Praise God.
[1:37:39] But I as your servant along with all
[1:37:43] these other servants tonight, we ask
[1:37:45] that in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:37:49] that the temper
[1:37:51] will leave him
[1:37:54] and the heart
[1:37:56] will be made well.
[1:37:59] You see, it wouldn't do any good to pray
[1:38:01] that the heart would be made well if you
[1:38:04] would leave what is agitating the
[1:38:06] sickness and causing the heart trouble.
[1:38:10] So deal with both. So don't just preach
[1:38:14] to me about divine healing and miracles
[1:38:16] and and then that but let's go down into
[1:38:18] the spirits of some of our people. Let's
[1:38:20] go down in and preach the gospel of the
[1:38:23] whole man and see if we don't find
[1:38:25] anxiousness about this and and all types
[1:38:28] of hard feelings about that. Come on,
[1:38:30] somebody. Unforgiving spirits and anger
[1:38:33] and whatever more. Let's let's bring
[1:38:35] healing to the whole man and it will
[1:38:38] lead to a change in our body.
[1:38:42] [Applause]
[1:38:49] He will be true to Christ all the days
[1:38:51] of his life and will be well to serve
[1:38:54] him in Jesus name. Amen. Bless you,
[1:38:56] brother.
[1:38:58] I believe it's all over.
[1:39:03] And you've been healed.
[1:39:07] So, I wasn't just healed in his heart,
[1:39:10] but he got delivered of that temper.
[1:39:16] No doubt this man got sick again, died
[1:39:20] of something else. I'm sure he's not
[1:39:22] still alive,
[1:39:25] but being healed of that temper
[1:39:28] will be with him forever.
[1:39:34] He could have got healed of his heart
[1:39:37] and if he had not been delivered of such
[1:39:38] a temper,
[1:39:41] he would have been lost.
[1:39:46] lost
[1:39:54] betting off the pressure and he's
[1:39:56] talking about the pressure building in
[1:39:57] the world
[1:39:59] and in the church. Boy, if he thought
[1:40:01] it's bad in ' 62, wonder what he'd say
[1:40:04] about it now.
[1:40:06] Even Christians, it's bothering them.
[1:40:08] See some of them all pressured up and
[1:40:11] they snap you off and enough temper all
[1:40:14] built up the way like they're going to
[1:40:15] blow up. What's the matter? Something's
[1:40:17] wrong.
[1:40:19] That shouldn't be.
[1:40:21] Temper
[1:40:23] comes from Satan.
[1:40:28] Why would we want to hold on to anything
[1:40:31] that comes from Satan?
[1:40:36] Put the Lord between you and that sin.
[1:40:40] Whatever that little besetting sin is.
[1:40:42] It might be lying.
[1:40:44] It might be stealing. It might be evil
[1:40:46] thinking. It might be temper. It might
[1:40:49] be drinking, smoking,
[1:40:52] gambling. You mean to tell me he would
[1:40:54] put temper
[1:40:56] with drinking,
[1:40:58] gambling,
[1:41:01] smoking? Yeah.
[1:41:03] Temper can be a besetting sin just like
[1:41:06] the person that cannot stop gambling.
[1:41:14] But of course, it's hidden.
[1:41:16] Many times only the wife sees it or the
[1:41:19] children or the husband if it's vice
[1:41:21] versa or the pastor.
[1:41:24] Because believe me, I know people in a
[1:41:26] way that most of you don't know them.
[1:41:33] All pastors do
[1:41:36] and it's so hid and nobody ever sees it
[1:41:40] until you ruffle their feathers with the
[1:41:42] word of God. Oh, and then all of a
[1:41:45] sudden you'll see something raise up. Oh
[1:41:47] my,
[1:41:49] there's deliverance for you today. Amen.
[1:41:54] My God, help us.
[1:41:56] Let me find a place to close down
[1:41:58] because I can tell you're getting
[1:41:59] heavier and heavier, harder and harder
[1:42:01] to get them amens. Before long, you're
[1:42:04] going to be saying amen. 14 syllables.
[1:42:08] That was a joke. Y'all should have
[1:42:10] laughed on that one. Thank you. Oh boy.
[1:42:13] Either my jokes are rotten or y'all are
[1:42:15] really heavy.
[1:42:17] That word is the truth. And the spirit
[1:42:19] of God will recognize his own writing.
[1:42:24] He's identified by his writing. It it
[1:42:27] speaks of him and you're identified by
[1:42:31] believing.
[1:42:33] It gives you your credentials
[1:42:38] of identification.
[1:42:40] Don't fuss with others. Don't have these
[1:42:43] family fusses.
[1:42:45] As I said, love breeds love and temper
[1:42:48] breeds
[1:42:50] temper. Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:42:54] Brother Brandham, when someone gets on
[1:42:57] me or steps on my toes, this might be a
[1:43:00] good one. Steps on my toes is the old
[1:43:03] saying is my temper rises. How can I
[1:43:05] overcome this thing? I know the Lord
[1:43:08] will have to do it because I cannot in
[1:43:11] my heart. I I don't want this thing.
[1:43:15] Sweeten your temper with prayer.
[1:43:20] Then
[1:43:22] make up your mind.
[1:43:25] Sweeten your temper with prayer than
[1:43:29] make up your mind.
[1:43:31] I don't guess that there's too many
[1:43:34] people in this building that ever had
[1:43:35] any more temper than I did to begin
[1:43:37] with.
[1:43:39] I had my mouth mashed all the time.
[1:43:43] I'd taken a lot of my meals
[1:43:46] out of a straw,
[1:43:49] right? Anybody know what mashmouth
[1:43:52] means?
[1:43:54] Folks from Virginia and Kentucky. All
[1:43:55] the rest y'all, where are you from?
[1:43:58] Well, this is a common saying in
[1:44:00] Kentucky. Not so much now because now
[1:44:01] they do. I'm giving you to 37.
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:18] Oh my pre. Some of them would be better
[1:44:20] off with a little belt. Oh yeah. Instead
[1:44:23] of the count.
[1:44:26] Oh my. My mother, as you know, was a
[1:44:28] half Indian. My father was an Irishman.
[1:44:31] A Kentucky Irish
[1:44:34] at that.
[1:44:35] Now both of them had enough temper to
[1:44:38] fight above Saul.
[1:44:42] Now I find it absolutely amazing because
[1:44:44] brother Brandman speaking about the
[1:44:46] Pentecostals and he'd talk about them
[1:44:47] speaking in tongues and jumping and
[1:44:49] running and shouting and then he'd turn
[1:44:51] right back around and say and with
[1:44:53] enough temper to fight above Saul.
[1:44:58] Does this is one thing friends I do not
[1:45:00] want in our church. I do not want that
[1:45:03] kind of Pentecost in our church. It's
[1:45:06] coming back in the message. That kind is
[1:45:09] not the Acts two kind.
[1:45:11] That kind will let you do whatever you
[1:45:13] want to do and live this and that and
[1:45:14] the other. And as long as you got signs
[1:45:16] and wonders and miracles and jump and
[1:45:17] shout and you shake and quiver and and
[1:45:19] do I believe in all of that, but don't
[1:45:22] shout here no high and you live. If you
[1:45:25] live high, have at her, brother. You can
[1:45:27] jump to the top of the mezzanine and
[1:45:29] back if that's what you want to do. But
[1:45:31] I believe we ought to live what we are
[1:45:34] shouting about. I believe we ought to
[1:45:36] jump and shout praise God with all of
[1:45:38] our hearts and be happy.
[1:45:43] That's the truth. Now listen at the
[1:45:46] honesty of this prophet of God. Now he's
[1:45:48] not talking about yesterday. He's not
[1:45:50] talking about he's talking about when he
[1:45:52] was a child.
[1:45:55] Now all the time my mouse was mashed.
[1:46:01] So in other words, either mama or daddy
[1:46:03] or somebody would just take the back of
[1:46:05] their hand was most the time the way I
[1:46:06] got it. The back part of the hand cuz
[1:46:08] the salt softer part of the hand is the
[1:46:10] front. You know this part right here
[1:46:12] salt. So you get the knuckles, you get
[1:46:14] the nails, you get the whole deal.
[1:46:19] Oh, I cannot believe some of y'all have
[1:46:21] never had a mashed mouse.
[1:46:25] Oh my goodness.
[1:46:28] Now listen. He says, "All that time my
[1:46:32] mouth was mashed. I was little to begin
[1:46:35] with and they picked me up and knocked
[1:46:38] me down
[1:46:41] and I'd get up again and they'd knock me
[1:46:43] down again till I wasn't unable to get
[1:46:47] up anymore. And then when I got able to
[1:46:50] get up, I'd go up again and then knock
[1:46:52] me down again.
[1:46:54] So that's just the way I had it. And I
[1:46:56] thought I could never be a Christian.
[1:47:00] But when the Holy Spirit came into my
[1:47:02] life,
[1:47:06] say it.
[1:47:09] You know the evils that I done when I
[1:47:11] was a kid fighting
[1:47:14] almost killed five men at one time.
[1:47:22] Took a rifle loaded with 16 shots. And
[1:47:25] when them boys beat me because I was a
[1:47:27] Kentucky, no other reason, I couldn't
[1:47:29] even hold my head up.
[1:47:32] One would hold me by my hands like this
[1:47:35] and the other one would stand there with
[1:47:37] a rock in his hand and pound me in the
[1:47:39] face
[1:47:41] till I was just lifeless.
[1:47:46] I stepped up with a hammer, pulled back
[1:47:48] on the rifle, and I said, "Now, which
[1:47:52] one of you wants to die first so you
[1:47:54] won't have to watch the others?" Well,
[1:47:57] that was real courteous.
[1:48:00] [Laughter]
[1:48:03] Oh my. They started squealing. Uhhuh.
[1:48:07] That's the way bullies do. Yeah. That's
[1:48:10] one thing about bullies. Whether it's
[1:48:12] pool pit bullies or school bullies, boy,
[1:48:14] you go to call and they're hiding, you
[1:48:15] watch them squeal.
[1:48:18] Oh my. They started squealing. I said,
[1:48:21] "Don't squeal cuz you're all going to
[1:48:24] die one by one."
[1:48:28] Now, you can see why a lot of message
[1:48:30] people don't read this quote.
[1:48:35] And they sure don't want no preacher
[1:48:37] reading it. And they sure wouldn't want
[1:48:40] no preacher reading it where several
[1:48:42] thousand people will hear it.
[1:48:47] But I'm going to read it. Amen. Cuz I
[1:48:50] want you to know
[1:48:55] this is why this man could preach it
[1:48:57] this way. He saw what it done to him and
[1:49:02] his family.
[1:49:06] Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:49:11] Okay. Well, I'm going to take it anyway.
[1:49:13] You didn't offer it freely, but I'm
[1:49:15] going to take.
[1:49:18] I said, "Don't squeal cuz you're all
[1:49:21] going to die one by one." And I'm meant
[1:49:23] it.
[1:49:25] And just then, they started squealing. I
[1:49:27] pulled up. Snap.
[1:49:30] The gun snapped. I throwed another shell
[1:49:32] in. Snapped. It snapped. Another shell.
[1:49:35] Snapped. It snapped.
[1:49:38] I pumped 16 shells
[1:49:42] on the ground and every one of them
[1:49:46] snapped.
[1:49:49] Them boys running and screaming.
[1:49:53] I'd say it this way. Like girls.
[1:49:58] Oh, I'd love to seen them bullies.
[1:49:59] Wouldn't you? Whoa, man. Running and
[1:50:02] screaming like a bunch of girls probably
[1:50:03] crying. Oh, mama. Mama, mama.
[1:50:08] them boys running and screaming and
[1:50:10] diving over the hill and everything.
[1:50:12] After they left, I stood there. I would
[1:50:14] get so angry I wouldn't cry. I would
[1:50:18] laugh like an idiot.
[1:50:21] Amen. And tears run out my eyes.
[1:50:25] Brother, sister, can't you see how bad
[1:50:28] he had it?
[1:50:33] I'm so glad for sovereign grace. I I
[1:50:35] don't want to go this way right here,
[1:50:36] but I I do too.
[1:50:39] I'm so glad that sovereign grace stepped
[1:50:41] in and stopped him from doing what he
[1:50:44] wanted to do cuz God knew I needed a
[1:50:48] prophet. God knew I needed a message and
[1:50:51] I needed a messenger and there was
[1:50:53] nobody else on the earth that could
[1:50:55] fulfill Malachi 4. Oh, hallelujah. Why
[1:50:58] didn't God throw him away and say, "I'll
[1:51:00] tell you what. I'll get Or Roberts. He
[1:51:02] never done nothing like that. I'll get
[1:51:03] Benny Graham. He's a good old Baptist
[1:51:05] boy. He ain't never done nothing like
[1:51:06] that. But God said, "No, I'm going to
[1:51:08] step down here and I'm going to stop
[1:51:10] your gun from going off 16 times because
[1:51:13] you don't know it yet. But you're going
[1:51:15] to preach a message and you're going to
[1:51:17] have quotes and you're going to say it
[1:51:18] over and over again. I've got another
[1:51:20] little hillbilly boy from down in
[1:51:22] Kentucky. He's going to stand there in
[1:51:24] 2025 and he's going to preach about
[1:51:26] deliverance from temper. I'm going to
[1:51:28] have a man there that's going to be
[1:51:30] delivered. I'm going to have a young
[1:51:31] girl that's going to be delivered. I'm
[1:51:33] going to have somebody from Switzerland,
[1:51:36] somebody from France. And by hearing
[1:51:38] that word and setting in that service,
[1:51:40] that evil thing will leave them right
[1:51:43] there.
[1:51:54] I would laugh like an idiot and tears
[1:51:57] run out of my eyes. Now that's a temper.
[1:52:00] And if it hadn't been for God,
[1:52:03] I'd been a murderer.
[1:52:08] A murderer.
[1:52:11] But sovereign grace stepped in.
[1:52:14] Abraham would have let his wife went in
[1:52:17] and become the wife of another man,
[1:52:20] but sovereign grace stepped in. Amen.
[1:52:24] A preacher who just stood right here in
[1:52:25] this pulpit,
[1:52:28] was abused as a boy,
[1:52:32] grew up, hated men, hated them,
[1:52:37] fought before he got saved,
[1:52:41] would beat men nearly to a pulp.
[1:52:47] Beat a man
[1:52:54] and he almost went to prison over it.
[1:52:57] But his worldly buddies went before the
[1:53:00] judge and lied and said, "No, no, he
[1:53:02] didn't do it. No, no, uh-uh. No, he
[1:53:04] didn't do it."
[1:53:06] Got filled with the Holy Ghost, got
[1:53:08] saved, filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:53:09] started preaching the message.
[1:53:11] Still had that anger, that temper.
[1:53:18] But one day him and his wife was riding
[1:53:20] down the road
[1:53:23] listening to a sermon preached by
[1:53:24] somebody
[1:53:26] called scarred human beings.
[1:53:30] And he let out a scream in the car not
[1:53:32] to scared his wife to death. She said,
[1:53:33] "What in the world is the matter with
[1:53:34] you?"
[1:53:36] He said, "That thing just left me."
[1:53:41] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Oh friends,
[1:53:45] no matter how desperate your needs are
[1:53:47] today, and you think I'm beyond help,
[1:53:50] no, you're not.
[1:53:52] God would not let go of our prophet, God
[1:53:55] stepped in sovereignly. Maybe there's
[1:53:57] some of you sitting here today, you'd
[1:53:59] have been a murderer or you'd been this
[1:54:01] and that and the other, but God had your
[1:54:03] name on his book and the devil said,
[1:54:06] "I'll take him out." And God said, "No,
[1:54:08] you won't. He's mine. She's mine. She
[1:54:12] belongs to me and I will step in and I
[1:54:16] will intervene.
[1:54:25] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:54:28] Thank you, Lord. Let me close. Right
[1:54:30] here's a good spot.
[1:54:34] If it hadn't been for God, I'd have been
[1:54:36] a murderer.
[1:54:38] And I picked up them shells and put them
[1:54:41] back in the rifle and pow pow,
[1:54:46] they'd shoot just as good as ever.
[1:54:51] Talk about grace.
[1:54:58] Hallelujah.
[1:55:04] Let's Let's bury it.
[1:55:21] Hallelujah.
[1:55:28] With every head bowed,
[1:55:31] no one looking around.
[1:55:37] As I said earlier, I know there's people
[1:55:38] here that
[1:55:41] it's never been one of your issues, one
[1:55:43] of your problems.
[1:55:46] And thank you for
[1:55:49] being so nice and courteous here in the
[1:55:52] service today to
[1:55:55] sit here while God
[1:55:58] spoke to other people.
[1:56:02] And let me say to you, those of you that
[1:56:06] maybe you have extreme temper,
[1:56:10] others of you, it may not be so extreme,
[1:56:12] but yet
[1:56:14] whenever it reaches its peak,
[1:56:17] you feel so bad
[1:56:20] and the spirit of God convicts you. Oh,
[1:56:22] you may not cuss and that sort of thing,
[1:56:24] but you just said things you shouldn't
[1:56:26] say, and you hurt the people that you
[1:56:29] love.
[1:56:31] You've wounded their hearts and spirits,
[1:56:35] whatever degree it is today.
[1:56:39] I believe our master is here.
[1:56:44] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:47] Hallelujah.
[1:56:51] Anybody just like to be remembered in
[1:56:52] prayer? Now, not necessarily for temper.
[1:56:55] Maybe it's maybe it's temper. Maybe it's
[1:56:57] healing in your body, healing in your
[1:56:59] spirit. Just it could be many many
[1:57:03] things
[1:57:05] but you believe God is mindful of you
[1:57:07] today. Would you just raise your hand to
[1:57:09] him?
[1:57:12] Father, I raise my hands to you as well.
[1:57:15] I've never had a violent temper. I've
[1:57:18] never been made up that way.
[1:57:21] But Lord, I have needs today.
[1:57:26] Lord, there's others here. They may not
[1:57:28] deal with that, but they deal with other
[1:57:29] things.
[1:57:31] And whatever our needs are and our
[1:57:33] faults and our shortcomings,
[1:57:35] we all say we need help from you,
[1:57:40] Lord Jesus.
[1:57:42] May your presence move in every heart
[1:57:45] here today.
[1:57:47] We desire to be
[1:57:50] a house, a tabernacle for the living
[1:57:55] God's presence to live in.
[1:57:59] Lord Jesus, may the spirit of God from
[1:58:02] the pull pit back up in the booths
[1:58:05] upstairs and the nurseries.
[1:58:08] Lord Jesus, there'll be many, many, many
[1:58:10] hundreds of people, way more people
[1:58:12] stream than set here. Lord, I pray you'd
[1:58:16] minister, dear God, to every heart.
[1:58:20] Lord, we need miracles here today.
[1:58:22] Physical ones for sure. People dealing
[1:58:25] with different sickness and things in
[1:58:27] their body, but no doubt we need
[1:58:29] miracles in the spirit.
[1:58:32] Miracles that will heal the broken.
[1:58:36] Lord is that brother that I mentioned,
[1:58:38] dear God, that had dealt with that
[1:58:40] hatred in his heart for men for years.
[1:58:44] And he would have been in prison.
[1:58:48] He would have been in prison
[1:58:51] had your mercy not intervened.
[1:58:55] But God, you knew he had a ministry to
[1:58:57] bring to the bride. And what a blessing
[1:59:00] he's been.
[1:59:03] Lord, maybe some of us would have been
[1:59:04] dead. Some of us would have been this or
[1:59:06] that or the other
[1:59:08] if the sovereign grace of God had not
[1:59:11] stepped in. Oh, I know many of us so
[1:59:13] cherish our free moral agency.
[1:59:17] And we think it's just the greatest
[1:59:18] thing ever was. But if they'd be really
[1:59:20] honest and look at theirel, they'd be
[1:59:22] able to realize their free moral agency
[1:59:24] is what's got them in such a mess and
[1:59:26] made so many bad decisions in their
[1:59:28] life.
[1:59:30] I know some folks don't like divine
[1:59:32] sovereignty, but I'm so grateful for it
[1:59:34] myself.
[1:59:35] The prophet said he would be a mighty
[1:59:37] discouraged person if he didn't believe
[1:59:40] in predestination.
[1:59:42] So would I, Lord, and I'm sure others
[1:59:44] sitting here today would.
[1:59:47] We love you, Lord Jesus. We need you,
[1:59:50] Father.
[1:59:52] Come by this way today, Lord God.
[1:59:58] Hallelujah. Anybody that would like to
[2:00:01] signify, Lord, I need your help today.
[2:00:06] Just stand to your feet, would you? It
[2:00:08] doesn't identify that you have a temper.
[2:00:10] Don't worry about that. It just means
[2:00:11] you have help from the Lord. You need
[2:00:13] help. Whatever avenue it is, healing in
[2:00:16] your body, in your spirit.
[2:00:18] Well, looks like all of us need help
[2:00:20] from the Lord today,
[2:00:23] including the man preaching to you.
[2:00:26] I want to be more like him. more like
[2:00:29] him.
[2:00:31] I'm not sure how much longer I have left
[2:00:33] on the earth as far as yours goes, but I
[2:00:35] want every day, every hour to go for him
[2:00:40] and for his people. I'm sure I've made
[2:00:43] mistakes, man, your pastor. I hope and
[2:00:46] trust I've never failed any of you. If I
[2:00:49] have, please forgive me. If I've ever
[2:00:52] done anything in any way that's been a
[2:00:55] stumbling block for before anyone around
[2:00:58] the world that I've preached to, then I
[2:01:02] humbly ask you, forgive me. It's not my
[2:01:06] intention. I've never studied one sermon
[2:01:09] to throw anything at anybody. I've never
[2:01:13] studied quotes and scriptures to try to
[2:01:16] find something to throw at people.
[2:01:19] I realize when I stand here, I'm going
[2:01:21] to have to answer for every sermon that
[2:01:22] I preach. I take this very, very
[2:01:26] seriously.
[2:01:30] I say to you as
[2:01:32] members of the church, would you say the
[2:01:35] same thing? Lord, if I've ever done
[2:01:37] anything to anybody, please forgive me.
[2:01:39] If I've ever been a stumbling block,
[2:01:42] if we could say it to one another as as
[2:01:44] the people of God or people that we know
[2:01:47] around the world,
[2:01:49] the prophet tells us part of the spirit
[2:01:51] of this last day is being able to
[2:01:55] repent. Repent, make things right, fix
[2:01:58] things. It takes humble people to be
[2:02:01] able to do it. Me Carol was talking
[2:02:03] about last night. I told her said, you
[2:02:05] know, you realize there's there's two
[2:02:06] things about it. We either humble
[2:02:09] ourselves
[2:02:11] before the mighty hand of God or God
[2:02:14] will humiliate us.
[2:02:18] I don't want God to humiliate me. I want
[2:02:21] to humble myself. Do you want to be
[2:02:24] humiliated? Sometimes the preaching of
[2:02:25] the word does that. You know why we felt
[2:02:27] humiliated? It's because we wouldn't
[2:02:29] humble ourselves. And then God goes to
[2:02:32] the next degree and then have preachers
[2:02:34] and sometimes you think, "Lord have
[2:02:35] mercy. How in the world he know I was
[2:02:36] doing this or that and the other?" God
[2:02:38] did it and it made you feel like
[2:02:39] everybody in the building knew you was
[2:02:41] guilty. What is it? It's a feeling of
[2:02:43] humiliation. And if we would stay
[2:02:45] humble, God will never have to humiliate
[2:02:49] us.
[2:02:51] Don't you love him? Would you do me a
[2:02:54] favor?
[2:02:56] Would you lay your hands on one another?
[2:03:00] Brother John, would you come up my
[2:03:01] brother?
[2:03:09] With a crowd of this size, no doubt
[2:03:11] there's many, many needs among us today.
[2:03:14] I want brother John to pray for us.
[2:03:20] Oh heavenly father. Yes, Lord Jesus. How
[2:03:24] rich and perfect is your word, Lord. Oh
[2:03:26] dear God, oh father God father and we
[2:03:30] thank you Lord Jesus that you're so
[2:03:33] mindful of us Lord help us Lord many
[2:03:36] many things Lord Jesus that the world
[2:03:38] just overlooks Father help us being your
[2:03:41] bride Father we're exposed to Father
[2:03:44] Jesus like not to make us feel bad Lord
[2:03:46] but to lift us up to get us closer to
[2:03:49] you Lord yes Lord Jesus we're so
[2:03:52] thankful Lord and not only are we
[2:03:53] thankful Lord Jesus but being a bride,
[2:03:56] we're receptive, Father God, of the
[2:03:58] creation, Lord Jesus, our
