[44:27] God bless you let's turn to First
[44:28] Corinthians chapter 1 verse 10 tonight
[44:30] if you would
[44:31] a great trip to not in the name of the
[44:33] Lord Jesus
[44:35] so happy to be together again tonight in
[44:37] the house of God
[44:39] I love going to church
[44:42] I love going to church I love singing I
[44:44] love praying I love praising I just love
[44:47] loving God
[44:49] I just love loving I was ordained to
[44:52] love him to serve him to live for him to
[44:55] be his
[44:57] amen
[44:58] God bless you let's pick up where we was
[45:01] looking at on last Wednesday night First
[45:04] Corinthians chapter 1 verse 10.
[45:07] now beseech your brethren by the name of
[45:10] our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak
[45:13] the same thing
[45:15] that there be no divisions among you now
[45:19] what you notice that Paul because of
[45:21] this contention and Division and stuff
[45:24] that's got into the Corinthian Church
[45:25] Paul is not unchristianizing these
[45:28] people
[45:29] they don't call them serpent seed and
[45:32] you don't call them a bunch of devils
[45:34] but he actually calls him brethren
[45:37] and he said by the name of our Lord
[45:39] Jesus Christ that shall speak the same
[45:41] thing that there be no divisions among
[45:45] you
[45:46] but that you be perfectly joined
[45:49] together in the same mind
[45:53] and in the same judgment wow wouldn't
[45:57] that be something and the same mind and
[46:00] then the same judgment
[46:02] so it's the word your judgment is the
[46:04] ability to look at something and look at
[46:07] it without impartiality
[46:09] so you don't judge it for this brother
[46:12] and you judge it one way and then you
[46:13] look at that brother and you judge it
[46:14] another way and look at that brother and
[46:16] you judge it another way but it's Paul
[46:19] Desiring the word mind is nuos which is
[46:22] different from fronio but it's a
[46:25] different word that we use the English
[46:26] language of mind for but it's being able
[46:28] to Value things look at things and
[46:32] discern them and judge them so this is
[46:35] what Paul was wanting to do Howie lays
[46:38] that foundation and then he tells them
[46:40] why they need that verse 11. for it has
[46:43] been declared unto me of you my brethren
[46:46] about them which are of the house of
[46:48] cloy
[46:49] that there are contentions among you
[46:52] strife
[46:54] debate variance wrangling
[47:00] verse 12.
[47:01] now this I say
[47:04] that every one of you saith I am of Paul
[47:07] I am of Apollos eye of cephas and eye of
[47:12] Christ
[47:13] is Christ divided
[47:16] was Paul crucified
[47:18] for you or were you baptized in the name
[47:22] of Paul now it was not that these people
[47:25] were saying well Paul is my Prophet
[47:26] messenger and a policies and evangelists
[47:30] and cephas is one of the foundation
[47:32] Apostolic Brothers but it was more
[47:35] exclusive it was like it was Paul and no
[47:39] one else Apollos and no one else cephas
[47:44] and no one else will we always have
[47:47] people that we are blessed by ministers
[47:50] more than others yes we will will there
[47:54] be certain ones that will be able to
[47:55] speak to us and just seem like you can
[47:58] receive so much from them yes is there a
[48:01] danger in that not necessarily not
[48:04] unless you isolate that individual and
[48:07] you can receive from no one else other
[48:10] than that individual then you're in
[48:12] trouble
[48:12] because then you're only one preacher
[48:14] away from not believing in Preachers
[48:17] you understand so if you get to where
[48:19] you're only a one person just a one
[48:22] preacher person then all Satan has to do
[48:24] is to hinder you with that one preacher
[48:27] and you lose confidence in him or he
[48:29] hurts you or whatever and then you no
[48:32] longer believe in him at all
[48:34] how many like to be remembered to as we
[48:36] pray God bless you to spot our heads
[48:39] Heavenly Father we come tonight with
[48:41] Thanksgiving in our hearts Lord
[48:42] gratefulness Lord Jesus for all that
[48:45] you've done for all of us we want you to
[48:47] know we're so grateful that we can be
[48:49] gathered together here tonight Lord and
[48:51] just still so happy that we've been able
[48:54] to move into our place and this is ours
[48:57] that you've given it to us and we're so
[48:58] thankful no more meetings at the Holiday
[49:00] again no more here and there and there
[49:03] we feel sort of like the children of
[49:04] Israel we've arrived and we're just so
[49:07] happy that we have and Lord God we're
[49:09] just thankful that you have proved
[49:12] yourself Among Us and every time we've
[49:14] been here you've met with us and we
[49:15] believe and accept nothing less than
[49:18] that because where we are is where you
[49:20] wish to be so we've come again tonight
[49:22] that we might be able to sing and
[49:24] worship and pray and testify bring
[49:26] prayer requests and just be able to
[49:28] submit everything that we are to you
[49:30] tonight I pray that you'd help me to get
[49:32] out of the way anoint me father with
[49:34] your presence but that wouldn't do a
[49:37] whole lot if you don't anoint them so I
[49:39] pray that should help them to be able to
[49:41] get out of the way me getting out of the
[49:43] way is only part of the equation they
[49:45] also must get out of the way to be able
[49:47] to hear and be able to receive and be
[49:50] able to pull help them Father that
[49:52] they'll be open to the channel of the
[49:54] Holy Ghost and they'll be able to listen
[49:56] and not just hear a Kentucky preacher
[49:59] stand up here but they'll be able to
[50:01] hear the spirit of God speaking to us
[50:03] tonight would you granted Lord we pray
[50:05] in the name of the Lord Jesus and the
[50:07] Saints said God bless you you may be
[50:10] seated
[50:14] I would imagine
[50:16] that a lot of these people
[50:19] No Doubt
[50:20] sought
[50:22] they were LED of the Lord
[50:24] by taking this stand
[50:27] most Christians are not going to do
[50:30] things out of spite or Envy or jealousy
[50:35] or because they think they're wrong
[50:37] they're going to do it because they feel
[50:40] like they're right and that's where that
[50:44] it's so tricky for us as Christians that
[50:47] we have to be so careful and what we do
[50:49] what we say our attitude our frame of
[50:53] mind and we judge it by the word now
[50:55] we're much easier to judge others many
[50:58] times than we are ourselves but I figure
[51:01] if we would judge everything that we do
[51:03] that would be a whole lot more capable
[51:06] of judging those that are around us with
[51:08] the proper type of judgment so no doubt
[51:11] many of the people felt like that they
[51:14] were right in their stand now we know
[51:17] that Satan absolutely hates true Oneness
[51:20] and unity and if you haven't heard the
[51:23] sermon uh called Oneness just the one
[51:25] word Oneness preached in 19 62 preached
[51:29] at the Branham Tabernacle and a while
[51:31] it'd be good to listen to it I
[51:33] absolutely love that sermon I've
[51:34] listened to it I don't know how many
[51:36] times in the last in the last decade
[51:38] since I've been in the message but it
[51:40] just speaks such volumes to my soul and
[51:43] I see from that sermon and immediately
[51:45] brother damn doesn't talk long it
[51:47] doesn't say a whole lot of preliminary
[51:49] stuff but he goes straight into it and
[51:51] he starts in the Garden of Eden with God
[51:54] and God making Adam and Eve placing them
[51:57] there in the garden and showing the very
[51:59] Perfection of Oneness and what it was
[52:02] and then he shows us how that that
[52:04] simple Oneness was broke between the man
[52:07] and his wife and then it was broke of
[52:09] course between God and it's an
[52:11] absolutely powerful sermon so Satan
[52:13] hates Divine Oneness and divine unity
[52:17] and what he will try to do is use the
[52:19] very same principle for thousands and
[52:22] thousands of years and that is divide
[52:25] unity and then
[52:27] reunite people under his idea of
[52:32] unification now he'll always have an
[52:35] agenda so he never divides people
[52:38] without already having something laid
[52:41] out to reunite them brother Brandon
[52:43] gives several examples in that sermon
[52:45] there so Satan divided Eve from her
[52:49] husband by what by breaking God's word
[52:53] and then he United her was who the
[52:57] serpent so whenever she believed the
[53:00] devil's lie then the prophet said she
[53:02] accepted it in her mind and death
[53:04] actually stepped inside of her soul so
[53:09] her Unity was broke with Adam broke was
[53:12] God but then she made another decision
[53:16] to unite with the serpent so breaking of
[53:20] unity is only step one of Satan's plan
[53:24] but he will always have a reunification
[53:27] nation that he wants you and I to unite
[53:30] with so if he can get us to break with
[53:32] the word break with the message of the
[53:34] hour break with the teachings of the
[53:36] truth he always has something else you
[53:39] watch people when they leave this word
[53:42] when they pull away from this message
[53:44] most of them will not stay on their own
[53:47] and have nothing to do with anybody else
[53:50] a lot of them have already been uniting
[53:53] behind the scenes and they've been
[53:55] talking to this person that person
[53:57] another person and there's already a
[54:00] reunification going on and they don't
[54:02] even consult with people that they
[54:04] should talk to about it but their mind
[54:06] begins to question the heart begins to
[54:09] question and you watch someone they
[54:10] leave the word of the hour and they'll
[54:12] go this way that way that way that way
[54:15] and they will reunite again with
[54:18] something against the very truth that
[54:21] they just left now that's Satan's way
[54:23] it's nothing new now he will have new
[54:26] names for new DOC he'll have new
[54:28] ideologies that'll meet the day the
[54:31] request and the desire of the day but
[54:33] it's the exact same principle that he
[54:36] used against Eve in the Garden of Eden
[54:39] and that was to be able to convince her
[54:42] that he is so concerned about her
[54:46] current situation can't you see how I
[54:49] presented that to Eve that he's
[54:51] presenting this uh opinion of God and
[54:54] this idea of God that God is trying to
[54:56] deprive you God don't really love you
[54:59] like he said or he would let you do this
[55:02] and that and the other but you God is is
[55:04] really depriving you of so much stuff
[55:07] now he's already got a reunification
[55:10] plan made before he ever divides her
[55:12] away from the program of God and and his
[55:15] words would absolutely been powerless if
[55:18] she would have not taken them into her
[55:20] mind received them down into her soul
[55:22] then she becomes the body by which he
[55:25] will enter into the human race it's the
[55:28] same way with human eye he'll try to
[55:30] disarm us by getting us to doubt our
[55:33] weapon and then he will unite us with
[55:36] either fear or unbelief or trauma or
[55:40] symptoms or whatever it is that you're
[55:42] dealing with he already has something
[55:44] else for you to be reunited with if he
[55:47] can get you separated from the pure love
[55:51] of God if he can get you separated from
[55:54] the things of God he will reunite you
[55:57] with hate with variance with emulation
[56:00] with Strife with jealousy for everything
[56:03] you and I let go of that God has us
[56:06] United with Satan has something there to
[56:10] replace it but I'll tell you looking at
[56:12] the agenda that he has I don't want none
[56:14] of his garbage he can keep it how many
[56:17] will say Amen
[56:18] now let's look again and watch the
[56:21] master builder now remember these this
[56:23] word here identifying Paul is not my
[56:26] words but it was Paul's word that he
[56:29] identified himself as a master builder
[56:31] now we've got some brothers here in the
[56:33] church and I would consider to be Master
[56:35] Builders and and they're they're very
[56:37] very good at what they do now I can
[56:39] build a little bit I can take a little
[56:41] bit of wood and maybe build a bed build
[56:44] up you know a nightstand I can build a
[56:46] few things like that but whenever I go
[56:49] to looking at a plan I saw all these
[56:52] plans of all this that was laid out I
[56:54] couldn't make head or tail out of it I
[56:56] couldn't understand one thing about it
[56:58] all them angles and this and that and
[57:00] the other yep there's Brothers here that
[57:02] was able to do it I saw brother Phil
[57:04] Gould's take them plans and lay it out
[57:07] you see these beautiful handrails that
[57:08] you see here all these around through
[57:10] all that I talked to other films that
[57:12] both feel I'd like something a little
[57:14] different I don't want it just to be the
[57:15] regular standard handrail I'd like
[57:18] something to to be a little bit
[57:19] different well what have you got in mind
[57:21] he said well I I've seen some handrails
[57:23] that I've saw in hospitals and
[57:25] industrial type buildings and they're
[57:27] they're larger I think I know what
[57:29] you're talking about but I'll talk to a
[57:31] guy so brother Phil had a guy to make a
[57:33] profile a profile of this and a profile
[57:36] of that now he knew what to call it all
[57:38] I didn't know what to call it I didn't
[57:40] have the word for it but by him knowing
[57:43] them sort of saying he helped me to
[57:46] bring out something I wanted this to be
[57:48] able to look at didn't it turn out nice
[57:50] and yet for me to say well I want to say
[57:54] look at me and say where are you from
[57:55] boy where in the world have you got in
[57:57] your mind but for somebody that's above
[58:00] me in understanding now why is mother
[58:03] feel above me because he knows how to
[58:06] build some of these other brothers the
[58:07] same way so it's unlike me that can take
[58:10] a piece of Walnut and transform it into
[58:12] something and make a night stand for
[58:14] Carol or make a canopy bed or make a
[58:16] mirror or something like that that's
[58:18] that's not a master builder so Paul is
[58:21] not just an evangelist Paul isn't just a
[58:24] preacher that could preach A good sermon
[58:27] but Paul was the master builder of the
[58:31] first church age now no doubt these
[58:33] people felt like that they were so
[58:36] spiritual because most people when they
[58:39] become
[58:39] isolationists in other words they are
[58:42] pulling theirself away from the rest of
[58:45] the body I don't need a pastor I don't
[58:47] need a church I don't need this and that
[58:50] I'm so spiritual and all that most of
[58:51] the time when they get there they're
[58:53] already in trouble already so Paul is
[58:57] now going to identify how these people
[58:59] really were they no doubt felt they were
[59:02] so spiritual but notice the way Paul
[59:04] identifies them from First Corinthians 3
[59:06] 3 for ye are yet
[59:11] carnal
[59:13] well then I want their spirituality out
[59:16] the window
[59:16] so they probably felt they were so
[59:19] spiritual and they had such
[59:21] understanding to make Apollos their
[59:24] leader and to make Paul their leader and
[59:27] oh we don't need Peter we don't need a
[59:29] Polish now remember Paul was a prophet
[59:31] and a church-aged messenger and Peter
[59:34] wasn't a prophet but yet Peter had some
[59:36] great input in the apostolic church and
[59:40] Apollos was a great preacher an
[59:42] evangelist Mighty the Bible calls this
[59:45] man Mighty in the scriptures now that's
[59:48] where we see him first appear so he was
[59:51] a man that had great benefit into the
[59:54] body but yet these people and now were
[59:56] divided and fussing and arguing among
[59:59] themselves and Paul identifies this as
[1:00:02] not being spiritual at all but carnal
[1:00:05] and happy about it whoops I'm sorry Word
[1:00:08] of Life
[1:00:10] calling you by your own name hard to
[1:00:12] break him old habits
[1:00:14] and Word of Life Church said
[1:00:16] for ye are not carnal for whereas there
[1:00:19] is among you in being and strife and
[1:00:24] divisions okay so every move that has
[1:00:28] ever hit this message purusia seven
[1:00:31] Thunders no Ministry on and on and on
[1:00:34] and on look at every one of them all of
[1:00:37] these traits followed every one of those
[1:00:39] moves why because the founders of those
[1:00:43] moves which were men with an agenda not
[1:00:48] with the same Minds that the master
[1:00:50] builder had now listen to him I'm going
[1:00:52] to run ahead of myself but just for a
[1:00:54] few moments that a preacher can actually
[1:00:57] build on the same Foundation that the
[1:01:00] apostles laid
[1:01:02] but he can use material that is
[1:01:06] combustible
[1:01:08] now Paul Likens this plan of God to a
[1:01:11] house that is being built and he said
[1:01:14] that a man can lay on this Foundation
[1:01:17] materials such as wood hay or stubble
[1:01:21] but that's not what Paul laid Paul laid
[1:01:25] Rock
[1:01:26] Stone
[1:01:27] so it's totally possible for a preacher
[1:01:31] to spend years of his life building on
[1:01:35] the foundation of truth but he lays and
[1:01:39] builds the stubble of his own agenda or
[1:01:43] he has the wheat or the the straw of an
[1:01:47] of an ambition and he's an ambitious man
[1:01:50] an opportunist preacher that waits for
[1:01:54] an opportunity to be able to build
[1:01:56] something around himself and the whole
[1:01:59] move is around him I saw when these men
[1:02:01] die the move collapses why because it's
[1:02:04] built on a man instead of built on the
[1:02:06] rock of the word
[1:02:07] well let me tell you one thing they're
[1:02:08] not Word of Life if you're built on me I
[1:02:10] feel sorry for you because I am getting
[1:02:13] to be an old man I'm only one breath
[1:02:15] away from being out of here so don't
[1:02:17] build on me build on Christ the word
[1:02:21] is that right we don't want to build on
[1:02:23] this man or no other man oh brother
[1:02:25] Donnie we're built on brother random no
[1:02:27] we are not built on brother Brandon we
[1:02:29] are built on Christ the word brother
[1:02:31] Brad I'm also being a master builder my
[1:02:33] brother Branham did not lay himself but
[1:02:36] he laid Christ on this pyramid of the
[1:02:39] Bride
[1:02:40] now what so Paul first has to kind of
[1:02:43] rebuke him a little bit and he says are
[1:02:45] you not yet carnal for whereas there is
[1:02:47] among you envying and strife and
[1:02:50] divisions are you not carnal and walk as
[1:02:53] men so first of all Paul has to strip
[1:02:55] away the symbolism that they have elated
[1:02:58] themselves into that they are so
[1:03:00] spiritual and they are so phenomenally
[1:03:03] Supernatural and they know so much about
[1:03:06] this and I know he said just look at the
[1:03:08] attributes of what's among you all and
[1:03:10] just look and see what your attitudes
[1:03:13] has produced and it will tell you that
[1:03:16] carnality has moved among you now notice
[1:03:19] now he's going to identify what it is
[1:03:21] and he don't say they're sitting around
[1:03:22] with video games in their hands and
[1:03:24] they're sitting there you know watching
[1:03:25] TV 24 7 and he doesn't say they're out
[1:03:28] running The Honky Tonks and doing all
[1:03:30] this that another but notice what makes
[1:03:32] them carnal they are so tied up in one
[1:03:35] preacher that they don't want to hear
[1:03:37] nobody else
[1:03:39] well that ain't spiritual at all if
[1:03:41] you're that way tonight you're carnal
[1:03:43] too
[1:03:44] for why one says I am of Paul and
[1:03:47] another I am of Apollos are you not
[1:03:51] carnal now remember he brings it over
[1:03:53] from chapter one on over to chapter
[1:03:56] three now against Apollo's wishes there
[1:04:01] was this this faction in the Church of
[1:04:04] Corinth against Paul's wishes now the
[1:04:08] letter to the Corinthian Church was
[1:04:10] actually written in the city of Ephesus
[1:04:13] so Paul is there in Ephesus and guess
[1:04:16] who is with Paul while he's in Ephesus
[1:04:19] Apollos Apollos was a great teacher very
[1:04:24] very smart but also a great evangelist
[1:04:27] now it was against Apollo's will as it
[1:04:30] was against cephas will which is Peter
[1:04:32] and also against Paul's will for these
[1:04:36] factions to be determined now in this
[1:04:39] situation it was not the preachers that
[1:04:42] wanted this to be this way but it was
[1:04:45] actually Satan which was moving among
[1:04:48] the body so Satan that got among the
[1:04:51] sheep and started dividing the Sheep now
[1:04:54] it was not a set of preachers that was
[1:04:56] in the wrong so Paul was not going
[1:04:58] behind Apollos back and running him down
[1:05:02] Apollos was actually with Paul when this
[1:05:05] was written so Apollos was right there
[1:05:08] now I want you to listen to this now so
[1:05:10] Paul strongly
[1:05:12] urged Apollos to go back to the city of
[1:05:16] Corinth but he would not go now listen
[1:05:19] Paul wanted him to go because what Satan
[1:05:22] is trying to do Satan is trying to
[1:05:25] divide the ministry he's trying to
[1:05:28] divide the brothers now the division is
[1:05:31] not between themselves but it's because
[1:05:34] Satan has been able to get on some sheep
[1:05:37] and divide them from Paul and divide
[1:05:40] these from Apollos and divide these from
[1:05:43] cephas and then divide the other group
[1:05:45] from preachers all together so and Satan
[1:05:48] wants to divide them because he knows
[1:05:50] this church is absolutely Unstoppable as
[1:05:54] long as they stay together he knew that
[1:05:57] Corinthian Church was Unstoppable
[1:05:59] remember God spoke to Paul and told him
[1:06:02] to say the UN Corinth and he was there
[1:06:03] for about 18 months or a little longer
[1:06:05] and preached to these people and the
[1:06:07] Lord Jesus said I have much people in
[1:06:10] this city so the devil was going to
[1:06:13] attack them like never before and he
[1:06:16] couldn't get between the preachers which
[1:06:18] is a rare thing but he couldn't get
[1:06:20] between the preachers because the
[1:06:22] preachers were one so what Satan did was
[1:06:25] then he divided the people now do you
[1:06:27] understand what was going on here in the
[1:06:29] city of Corinth in this church it was a
[1:06:32] demonic warfare it was not just a
[1:06:35] difference of opinion but demons were
[1:06:38] coming among the church people and
[1:06:41] causing them to argue and debate and
[1:06:43] so no doubt when they'd come to
[1:06:45] church depending on who was going to
[1:06:47] preach you know Paul was up there then
[1:06:49] they'd screamed and holler the Paul
[1:06:51] lights would scream and holler amen
[1:06:53] glory to God and if Apollos was going to
[1:06:55] preach then the others would scream and
[1:06:57] holler oh how pitiful we ought to be
[1:06:59] amening the word we shouldn't be Amen in
[1:07:02] our favorite preacher who's preaching it
[1:07:05] is that right now watch this in First
[1:07:08] Corinthians chapter 16 verse 12 Paul
[1:07:10] says as touching our brother upon us I
[1:07:15] greatly desired him to come unto you
[1:07:18] with the Brethren but his will was not
[1:07:22] at all to come at this time but he will
[1:07:26] come when he shall have a convenient now
[1:07:29] now Paul felt the necessity to let the
[1:07:32] Corinthian Believers know he had no
[1:07:35] jealousy at all toward Apollos so he
[1:07:40] makes this part of the public letter
[1:07:42] which is going to be written to the
[1:07:44] Corinthian Saints he wants them to know
[1:07:47] that he did not keep Apollos from coming
[1:07:50] back to preach you with me he wanted to
[1:07:54] be able to let them people know so it
[1:07:57] would stop the mouths of them demons
[1:07:59] among the saints of God
[1:08:02] I want you to think friends how
[1:08:04] sometimes when we get into situation and
[1:08:07] we're saying well it's his brother
[1:08:08] against that brother says sister against
[1:08:10] that sister if you could only look and
[1:08:12] see with spiritual eyes it would
[1:08:14] probably scare most of us to death it's
[1:08:17] demons demons out of hell getting on
[1:08:21] good people that love God now as I said
[1:08:24] these people were not demons themselves
[1:08:26] Paul classifies them as brothers so they
[1:08:29] were people who loved the Lord they were
[1:08:31] people that thought they was excelling
[1:08:33] in the agenda of God and yet demons had
[1:08:36] got among them and dividing them and
[1:08:37] they was arguing and fussing and
[1:08:40] debating how pitiful and it had to be
[1:08:42] dealt with now notice so then Paul first
[1:08:46] he wants to set forth and I want you to
[1:08:48] notice what he calls Apollos as touching
[1:08:52] our brother our brother Apollos I
[1:08:56] greatly desire listen to the words now
[1:08:59] this is not a little guy that can take
[1:09:01] up couple of boards and build a little
[1:09:03] birdhouse this is not a God that can be
[1:09:06] able to take up a few boards and and
[1:09:08] build up a hog trough to be able to feed
[1:09:10] them some slopping but this is a master
[1:09:13] builder so his choice of words are
[1:09:16] precise and correct and exactly what the
[1:09:20] spirit of God would be able to help
[1:09:22] break that division which is God Among
[1:09:25] the people because part of the
[1:09:26] apollocytes no doubt they thought well
[1:09:28] Paul ain't gonna let him come back no
[1:09:30] more now we see what kind of man Paul is
[1:09:32] he's trying to keep him away from the
[1:09:33] church so Paul said well let me just let
[1:09:36] you all know I actually invited Apollos
[1:09:39] himself to come and preach but Apollos
[1:09:42] would not come
[1:09:45] you imagine them Devils went into heart
[1:09:47] spells they're looking for their
[1:09:48] nitroglycerin oh no don't tell me oh no
[1:09:51] he doesn't cut our head off that's what
[1:09:53] men of God do they stand right there and
[1:09:55] take that word and slice the devil like
[1:09:58] pastrami
[1:10:02] notice but he said his will not me
[1:10:08] not me
[1:10:10] there is no telling what this one verse
[1:10:12] done in the Corinthian Church
[1:10:14] but his will was not to come at all at
[1:10:19] this time but he will come when he shall
[1:10:22] have convenient time now he does not
[1:10:25] want them to suspect jealousy he does
[1:10:28] not want them to expect anything wrong
[1:10:31] there's nothing wrong between them
[1:10:32] brothers and Paul also wants them to
[1:10:35] know that he has a freedom
[1:10:38] from this type of preacher jealousy oh I
[1:10:42] wish a lot of guys in her ranks had that
[1:10:44] why because it is selfish they can't
[1:10:48] stand it to watch God bless another man
[1:10:51] now listen this myself I I can relate
[1:10:55] maybe a little bit to the way that
[1:10:57] Apollos must have fell now we know that
[1:11:00] when he first appears the Bible says
[1:11:02] that he was a man that was mighty in the
[1:11:04] scriptures and he was taking the Bible
[1:11:06] and making known to the Jews about
[1:11:09] Christ about who he was and of his
[1:11:12] Messianic visit to the Earth but he
[1:11:14] didn't know really about the
[1:11:16] dispensation of the Holy Ghost and all
[1:11:17] that so the fourth Century historian and
[1:11:21] theologian Jerome
[1:11:23] uh one of the patriarchal fathers says
[1:11:27] about this right in it from a historical
[1:11:30] perspective that Apollos was so
[1:11:34] broken-hearted
[1:11:35] because the people had raised up this
[1:11:39] faction in the Corinthian Church he
[1:11:43] refused to go back there is not another
[1:11:45] place in the scripture where Apollos
[1:11:48] ever visited the Church of Corinth again
[1:11:54] now think why would he do that
[1:11:58] this man was so greatly used in Corinth
[1:12:03] I believe myself it was Satan
[1:12:07] Satan trying to stop that great man of
[1:12:10] God
[1:12:11] try to divide the people and if that
[1:12:14] didn't work
[1:12:15] stop that man from ever coming back to
[1:12:19] the city of Corinth
[1:12:22] so actually what Apollos did was he
[1:12:26] opted to stay away
[1:12:28] and as I said no scriptural place that
[1:12:32] we ever had that he ever went back again
[1:12:34] why
[1:12:35] why because the people allowed demons to
[1:12:40] get among them
[1:12:42] let me just share a personal story with
[1:12:44] you tonight can I
[1:12:46] visited a country many years ago
[1:12:50] I went there for special meetings
[1:12:53] the Lord met us in a mighty way
[1:12:58] I don't know when I've ever stood under
[1:13:00] such an anointing there was Miracles
[1:13:01] there was healing the anointing on the
[1:13:04] word was just phenomenal
[1:13:07] the Lord just really really showed
[1:13:09] himself how great he was that's what it
[1:13:12] was too
[1:13:13] but after I got back home from being in
[1:13:16] that place
[1:13:17] it was reported to me that the people of
[1:13:21] that assembly the pastor and some of the
[1:13:25] other visiting people that were there
[1:13:28] began to say that my Ministry
[1:13:31] was the voice of the Midnight Cry
[1:13:36] now where they were taking this from was
[1:13:38] Matthew 25. about midnight they went out
[1:13:42] a cry go you out to meet the bridegroom
[1:13:46] so they started trying to promote me
[1:13:49] that this is all of me being totally
[1:13:51] ignorant of it but they were saying ah
[1:13:54] my Ministry was going to be the voice
[1:13:57] that was going to awaken the bride
[1:14:03] what a shame
[1:14:06] I said what a shame
[1:14:09] now when I heard that from a dear friend
[1:14:11] of mine
[1:14:13] it like to broke my heart
[1:14:17] and I thought Lord what am I to do
[1:14:21] for years then people have wanted me to
[1:14:24] come back
[1:14:26] I've never been back
[1:14:31] because all it would take would be
[1:14:33] someone to say I think brother Donnie
[1:14:35] believes that
[1:14:37] it would spread around the message
[1:14:39] that I preached it or I promoted it or I
[1:14:42] believed it and I was totally innocent
[1:14:45] what happened
[1:14:48] Satan getting among the people to hinder
[1:14:51] my Ministry from ever being able to go
[1:14:54] back and be a blessing to that part of
[1:14:57] the world
[1:14:58] and you look at Apollos and what a
[1:15:01] straight that the man must have been in
[1:15:03] now those of you that's ever followed
[1:15:06] preachers around very much and and be
[1:15:09] with them as they preach in different
[1:15:10] places and you probably know that
[1:15:12] preachers have certain places that they
[1:15:16] prefer to preach in there's places I
[1:15:20] absolutely love to preach in
[1:15:22] and then there's places I just preach in
[1:15:28] uh-huh you think it's funny you ought to
[1:15:30] be there
[1:15:31] there's places that I go and I really
[1:15:34] don't like it there's places that I go
[1:15:37] that I never feel like I can ever get
[1:15:39] off the ground there's places I go I
[1:15:41] never felt like I've ever reached a
[1:15:44] climax of what God would want you to go
[1:15:46] but yet they want you to come they say
[1:15:48] you're a blessing and you go oh my
[1:15:51] goodness it's like going and getting a
[1:15:52] root canal or something like that
[1:15:54] Pleasant you know and you think Lord
[1:15:56] please let me get sick please let
[1:15:57] something happen Lord let something come
[1:15:59] up let there be a plan you know my plane
[1:16:01] will be grounded for 14 hours and I
[1:16:03] won't be able to that's just the way you
[1:16:05] feel
[1:16:06] but yet whenever something comes up and
[1:16:09] you so are excited about going and being
[1:16:12] a part of this convention or this and
[1:16:14] that and you can't go you just feel so
[1:16:16] sad and so low because it's just one of
[1:16:18] those places that God's given you favor
[1:16:20] with those people you can't buy that
[1:16:23] favor you cannot you cannot get it any
[1:16:25] other way than God given it to you so
[1:16:28] you can you imagine with me a little bit
[1:16:30] tonight how our brother Apollos must
[1:16:33] have felt because God used this man in
[1:16:36] such a way that he was as far as some of
[1:16:40] the people he must have been a man of
[1:16:42] such caliber and such understanding that
[1:16:45] some of the people it would have been
[1:16:46] almost like this that he just excelled
[1:16:49] to a level to what they thought was that
[1:16:52] to equivalent of Paul now we know paulus
[1:16:55] never preached that of course he never
[1:16:56] believed that about himself no doubt he
[1:16:58] had a revelation that Paul was a
[1:17:00] church-aged messenger and he would never
[1:17:02] Excel to that position but I wonder how
[1:17:05] many times and I have thought about it
[1:17:06] in the last last few weeks looking at
[1:17:08] Apollos I don't think I've ever actually
[1:17:10] preached on the brother other than just
[1:17:12] passing but I've been studying quite a
[1:17:13] bit about him everything that I could
[1:17:15] find and just thinking in my heart how
[1:17:17] the man must have felt and how sad and
[1:17:20] how he must have relived as I have the
[1:17:23] meetings that I had years ago in that
[1:17:25] place and still my mind I go back to
[1:17:28] those meetings although it's been
[1:17:30] decades ago and I think in my heart I
[1:17:33] love to go back and I'm not saying I
[1:17:34] wouldn't go back if God ever told me to
[1:17:36] I would but just that hanging over and
[1:17:39] you think Lord I don't ever want to be
[1:17:41] guilty of nothing like that but I want
[1:17:43] you to notice this man now this man
[1:17:47] was a caliber of man
[1:17:49] that would not allow his ministry to be
[1:17:53] a blessing to those that it could be a
[1:17:56] blessing to because it would have caused
[1:17:59] a division in the Corinthian Church
[1:18:03] now I guarantee you that there was a lot
[1:18:05] of men in this first century
[1:18:07] they would have had a total different
[1:18:09] View and a total different reaction to
[1:18:13] this scenario
[1:18:14] if they would have heard that they had a
[1:18:18] great pool in the Corinthian Church and
[1:18:20] that they had a great capacity of
[1:18:22] influence on the Corinthian people they
[1:18:25] would have caught the first ship or the
[1:18:27] first Chariot or the first donkey or the
[1:18:31] first pair of Nike shoes and they would
[1:18:33] have hiked back to Corinth and they
[1:18:35] would have went right there and you know
[1:18:37] what they would have done they would
[1:18:38] have split that church wide open
[1:18:42] but not Apollos
[1:18:45] you see Apollos looked at it and he
[1:18:48] waited out
[1:18:49] and he realized to divide this church
[1:18:54] how could he ever go and say well God
[1:18:56] bless him and maybe maybe Apollos could
[1:18:58] have come and said well the people want
[1:19:00] me to the people are pulling on me the
[1:19:04] people are really pulling
[1:19:07] he could have said that
[1:19:11] and then Paul could have come and said
[1:19:13] and Apollos was led and pulled by a
[1:19:18] bunch of carnal-minded people and they
[1:19:21] pulled him to make the wrong decision
[1:19:27] and my my church tonight I just want to
[1:19:30] make sure because y'all ain't even
[1:19:32] breathing or y'all know how you're doing
[1:19:33] that
[1:19:37] so Apollos gets so upset
[1:19:42] and so tore up
[1:19:45] that Upon Us joins
[1:19:47] with Zenus
[1:19:50] which was a converted Jewish lawyer
[1:19:56] an Apollos leaves Ephesus
[1:19:59] and he goes to Crete
[1:20:02] way away from Corinth he wouldn't go
[1:20:04] nowhere near now keep in mind they
[1:20:06] didn't have podcasts they didn't have
[1:20:08] streaming they didn't have televisions
[1:20:10] and all that sort of thing so the only
[1:20:12] way that they could have ever heard of
[1:20:14] paulus was actually in his body form
[1:20:17] Paul is as far as we know never even
[1:20:19] wrote One epistle not one thing so the
[1:20:23] only way that this could be carried on
[1:20:26] was for Apollos himself to go there but
[1:20:29] this man looked at the value and the
[1:20:32] stakes and he considered the price
[1:20:36] so if I do this what will it bring to
[1:20:40] the church at Corinth
[1:20:42] what will it do to the move of God
[1:20:47] so here he did not want to be the cause
[1:20:50] of the division in this local assembly
[1:20:55] so he decides I'm going the other way I
[1:20:59] will not go back and as I said there's
[1:21:01] no scripture where he ever did go back
[1:21:04] because carnal people under the
[1:21:08] influence of demons
[1:21:11] hindered this man's Ministry
[1:21:17] everybody want to break and go get a
[1:21:19] coat and come back or
[1:21:21] should I continue well I've got you
[1:21:24] read this man acts chapter 18 verse 26.
[1:21:28] speaking of Apollos to give you a little
[1:21:29] insight of this man's great ability and
[1:21:32] he began to speak boldly in the
[1:21:34] synagogue home one Aquila and Priscilla
[1:21:37] had heard they took him unto them and
[1:21:40] expounded unto him the way of God more
[1:21:44] perfectly now he he was a couple of
[1:21:46] dispensations behind but one thing I
[1:21:50] love about this preacher was he was a
[1:21:52] man that could take instruction when you
[1:21:55] find that you found a jewel keep him
[1:21:57] notice so here is equivalent of
[1:22:00] Priscilla which is a man and his wife
[1:22:03] now they were living of course in Rome
[1:22:05] and they were Roman citizens and they
[1:22:07] had heard this man speak but they knew
[1:22:09] that he was he was behind so he was
[1:22:12] taking some of the scriptures and and
[1:22:14] showing oh eloquent speaker and really
[1:22:17] really noted in the scriptures you see
[1:22:19] this is why this man would not cause the
[1:22:21] division in the Corinthian Church
[1:22:23] because he knew the scriptures
[1:22:28] acts 18 27 and when he was disposed to
[1:22:32] pass into China the Brethren wrote I
[1:22:36] want you to notice now how the Apostolic
[1:22:39] Church moved we say that we have been
[1:22:42] restored to the apostolic faith but I
[1:22:45] wonder sometimes
[1:22:48] I want you to notice how that the
[1:22:50] ministers worked with the churches
[1:22:54] and how that uh an evangelist did just
[1:22:57] not go here and there and there and hand
[1:22:59] out his card and I'm going to go here
[1:23:01] that's that's not the way they worked at
[1:23:03] all
[1:23:04] they went by recommendation
[1:23:08] so this kept out a lot of sedition this
[1:23:13] kept out a lot of wolves
[1:23:15] now notice what happens when the
[1:23:18] Brethren hear him
[1:23:19] the Brethren wrote exhorting the
[1:23:23] disciples to receive him so the brothers
[1:23:26] here they write to the people at Corinth
[1:23:31] so this man went through the apostolic
[1:23:35] protocol I guarantee one thing we'll be
[1:23:37] a whole lot better off if we operated
[1:23:39] churches and the messages like this
[1:23:40] right here instead of it's amazing to me
[1:23:43] that people can sit in a church and the
[1:23:46] pastor not use them because he knows
[1:23:48] there's something that just ain't quite
[1:23:50] right and yet other preachers will use
[1:23:52] them and you think they don't even call
[1:23:54] the preacher that the pastor to ask
[1:23:56] about him and we claim we're restored
[1:23:59] back to Bible Faith which Bible are you
[1:24:01] reading
[1:24:03] now notice this is in your Bible Well
[1:24:05] Bible Believers right we are Bible
[1:24:07] believers
[1:24:09] so the Brethren wrote exhorting the
[1:24:13] disciples to receive him now you see the
[1:24:17] Corinthian Church would not have
[1:24:19] received Apollos without reference from
[1:24:24] other people other believers that were
[1:24:27] established in the truth well this is
[1:24:30] your Bible you can set it when you get
[1:24:31] home notice so the Brethren wrote
[1:24:34] exhorting the disciples to receive him
[1:24:37] who when he was come helped them much
[1:24:42] now notice so this brother one visit one
[1:24:45] visit makes such a powerful impact can
[1:24:48] you imagine what they could have gleaned
[1:24:51] out of this man's Ministry for years and
[1:24:54] years and years to come if they had not
[1:24:58] allowed the devil to bring this division
[1:25:00] among them
[1:25:02] what a shame this man of God Harry was
[1:25:05] able to give them so much stuff but I
[1:25:08] wonder how many nights said he laid on
[1:25:10] his bed and cried and wept and felt God
[1:25:13] what can I do if I go back I know it's
[1:25:16] going to cause a division in the church
[1:25:18] and it will be my name will be
[1:25:20] associated with this down Through the
[1:25:22] Ages I'm so glad that we can read this
[1:25:26] about our brother I've done got a new
[1:25:28] hero in the New Testament I don't mind
[1:25:29] telling you I was laying there awake
[1:25:31] this morning before daylight thinking I
[1:25:33] can't wait to walk up there and Shake
[1:25:35] That brother's hand God bless you
[1:25:36] brother thank you for being a gallant
[1:25:39] man of God thank you for not going down
[1:25:41] there and you know wanting to build you
[1:25:43] a big name or a big reputation or
[1:25:45] whatever more and divide in that church
[1:25:47] at Corinth my goodness they had enough
[1:25:49] problems the way it was didn't they but
[1:25:51] I want you to notice now that the Bible
[1:25:54] says that he helped them much which had
[1:25:56] believed through Grace oh it doesn't
[1:25:59] really tell us what all that he preached
[1:26:01] but it must have been so wonderful now
[1:26:03] let me read you a few scriptures and
[1:26:05] show you that what I'm preaching here to
[1:26:07] you tonight is from your Bible your
[1:26:10] Bible and show you how that the church
[1:26:13] was set up and how the church was
[1:26:16] supposed to grow and multiply and Hound
[1:26:19] that they actually sent letters of
[1:26:22] commendation or recommendation and this
[1:26:25] is the way the ministry was to go out
[1:26:29] second Corinthians chapter 3 verse one
[1:26:31] Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves
[1:26:34] or need we as some others now notice
[1:26:39] Paul is writing to the Corinthians and
[1:26:41] telling them do I need letters of
[1:26:43] recommendation I am the one who founded
[1:26:45] this church do I need these letters do
[1:26:48] you all need me to be recommended but I
[1:26:49] want you to notice that it's not
[1:26:51] rebuking letters of recommendation
[1:26:53] because he says Do We Begin Again to
[1:26:55] commend ourselves or need we as some
[1:26:58] others so some others didn't need them
[1:27:01] so it wasn't like this God just jumped
[1:27:03] up overnight nobody knew it nobody heard
[1:27:05] about him nobody knew absolutely nothing
[1:27:07] about him and he starts taking the big
[1:27:09] tours through the message and preaching
[1:27:11] all over the world and nobody ever heard
[1:27:13] of him before believe it or not that has
[1:27:14] happened in our ranks why because we
[1:27:17] don't follow Apostolic Forum from the
[1:27:20] Bible and the church said you see if we
[1:27:23] would do this it would eliminate a lot
[1:27:26] of this stuff and it would scare the
[1:27:28] liver out of these Kingdom building
[1:27:29] preachers because they're afraid that be
[1:27:32] exposed but they know they can move
[1:27:34] Among Us and do these things and very
[1:27:37] few is going to call their ham will you
[1:27:38] happen to be looking at one tonight who
[1:27:41] will
[1:27:42] well praise the Lord now notice or
[1:27:46] letters of commendation from you so why
[1:27:49] is Paul quoting this now this seems very
[1:27:51] odd to us but this was a common thing
[1:27:54] that was done in the apostolic era now
[1:27:57] this is around 57 58 A.D so it's been
[1:28:00] going on for quite some time so a man
[1:28:02] would just come in hey I'm a traveling
[1:28:03] evangelist I'll let you well who knows
[1:28:05] you well nobody where do you come from
[1:28:07] well I'm from here and there whether
[1:28:09] from here from there go preach here and
[1:28:11] there because you ain't preaching for us
[1:28:12] until we find out who you fellowship
[1:28:14] with how many wives you God how many
[1:28:16] times you've been married what do you
[1:28:17] believe about that well come on Church
[1:28:18] what you want me to receive anybody and
[1:28:21] everybody that comes to you to stand up
[1:28:23] there and feed to you that preacher may
[1:28:25] be packing a lust devil he may be
[1:28:27] packing an old fornication devil he may
[1:28:29] pack in an old pornography devil you
[1:28:31] want me to let him stand up here and
[1:28:32] open up his soul to you and you walk out
[1:28:35] of your Anointed with that same evil
[1:28:36] thing that's on him no sir not as long
[1:28:38] as I'm in my right mind ain't doing it
[1:28:42] oh my
[1:28:46] now notice what happens here in Acts 11
[1:28:49] 22 then Tidings of these things came
[1:28:53] into the ears of the church which was in
[1:28:55] Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas
[1:28:58] now notice how that the ministers was
[1:29:02] sent forth they did not go on their own
[1:29:05] well I I feel led to go over here to
[1:29:08] Timbuktu and I'm going to do this
[1:29:09] another no that's not the way it was
[1:29:11] listen to taking sides with Jesus 1962
[1:29:15] and you'll hear Brother Branham say that
[1:29:18] he wished he had many young preachers
[1:29:20] that he could send to India that he
[1:29:22] could send to Africa and make them
[1:29:25] Outpost was his word an outpost in India
[1:29:28] an outpost in Africa and he says when he
[1:29:31] was there in many converts come to the
[1:29:33] Lord and he said in a few days he would
[1:29:35] be gone he said but how I'd love to add
[1:29:37] young men and say before I leave there
[1:29:40] be a young man that will come and
[1:29:42] Associates will come with him and
[1:29:44] they're on their Road and he said
[1:29:45] they'll be here to say established a
[1:29:48] church how is it supposed to be set up
[1:29:50] that's the way brother random said that
[1:29:52] it should be well notice the Bible now
[1:29:54] how they've done so whenever they begin
[1:29:57] to hear of things that was going on so
[1:29:59] it come into the ears of the church in
[1:30:01] Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas
[1:30:04] you mean the church send forth Barnabas
[1:30:07] so Barnabas didn't go out on his own
[1:30:09] well I feel to go over here I feel
[1:30:12] you'll never find them words in the New
[1:30:15] Testament
[1:30:16] I feel to go do this I feel to go do
[1:30:18] that show me where it's at
[1:30:23] you see friends we have eroded
[1:30:26] from Apostolic truth
[1:30:28] and yet we pride ourselves in Ben
[1:30:30] Apostolic are we really why does it seem
[1:30:33] so strange to you tonight I'm reading it
[1:30:34] from your Bible
[1:30:36] now notice again in Acts 15 22 watch
[1:30:39] this it goes all through the New
[1:30:40] Testament
[1:30:41] then pleased it the apostles and the
[1:30:45] elders
[1:30:46] with the whole church
[1:30:48] to send chosen men
[1:30:51] of their own company to Antioch was Paul
[1:30:56] and Barnabas
[1:30:59] so whenever disputes come up among the
[1:31:02] Brethren and among the churches so this
[1:31:05] man didn't decide oh I'm gonna go over
[1:31:07] and take care of all that I'm gonna go
[1:31:08] over and fix this and that another I'm
[1:31:10] gonna do this and that that's not the
[1:31:11] way it was in the Bible
[1:31:15] hmm
[1:31:16] so it was before the elders and the
[1:31:20] whole church
[1:31:21] to sin chosen men of their own company
[1:31:24] that they didn't go any many many more
[1:31:27] which one should be let go
[1:31:30] but it was Men of their own company if
[1:31:34] they're going to establish churches if
[1:31:36] they're going to straighten out issues
[1:31:38] they want men going from their own
[1:31:41] company
[1:31:45] to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas namely
[1:31:48] Judas
[1:31:50] surname's rather and Silas Chief and
[1:31:54] they wrote Letters by them
[1:31:58] out to this manner the apostles and
[1:32:01] elders and Brethren now amen whoa whoa
[1:32:03] whoa whoa
[1:32:05] where's the thing I feel led
[1:32:10] what's the same what these brothers said
[1:32:12] now I feel that that I need to go over
[1:32:13] there and straighten that situation
[1:32:15] where where's that at
[1:32:21] well I'm sorry honey you didn't know
[1:32:23] this is in your Bible you ought to spend
[1:32:25] more time on that book instead of on
[1:32:27] Facebook
[1:32:28] get ready Instagram and get instant Holy
[1:32:31] Ghost
[1:32:32] get rid of tick tock and get on the
[1:32:34] clock
[1:32:37] so here they wrote letters
[1:32:40] by them after this manner the apostles
[1:32:42] and elders and brethrens sent greetings
[1:32:44] unto the Brethren which are of the
[1:32:47] Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and
[1:32:49] solicia now the main thing here that's
[1:32:51] going on is some of the Jews have said
[1:32:53] these Gentiles have got to be
[1:32:54] circumcised they can't eat this they
[1:32:56] can't do that they can't do the other so
[1:32:58] instead of one man saying I feel led of
[1:33:00] the Lord to go over and straighten this
[1:33:01] whole thing out they said you sit down
[1:33:03] and shut up we're not even choosing you
[1:33:05] we can tell by your attitude you're the
[1:33:07] wrong guy so can you imagine the church
[1:33:10] assuming that they
[1:33:13] they are the ones that's going to
[1:33:15] straighten out this issue and if new
[1:33:18] works are going to be formed the church
[1:33:20] is going to be the ones to do it well
[1:33:23] that's only if we believe the Bible
[1:33:30] well it seemed like to me it's getting
[1:33:32] hot in here
[1:33:33] is it just me
[1:33:35] no it ain't okay I see some of y'all's
[1:33:38] face is getting red too
[1:33:40] for this much as we have heard that
[1:33:43] certain
[1:33:45] which went out from us
[1:33:48] ah here we go
[1:33:51] so you see some of them went out from
[1:33:54] them but they were not sent from them
[1:34:00] there is a great difference
[1:34:02] have troubled you
[1:34:04] with words now listen to what they've
[1:34:07] done
[1:34:08] subverting your souls
[1:34:14] you must be circumcised and keep the law
[1:34:17] to whom we gave no such commandment
[1:34:22] and it seemed good unto us being a
[1:34:25] symbol was one Accord
[1:34:27] to send chosen men unto you you see
[1:34:30] friend a lot of our problems is many of
[1:34:33] us are so terrified of organization we
[1:34:37] hate organism
[1:34:42] now if message search is done this way
[1:34:45] right here the scripture where people
[1:34:46] say Lord have mercy they're acting like
[1:34:49] denomination oh no you've got it
[1:34:51] backwards this is the original and
[1:34:54] denomination only took their junk from
[1:34:56] this pattern so to scare us to death
[1:34:59] this is the way they dealt with issues
[1:35:03] in the original Church
[1:35:05] honestly believe there's going to be
[1:35:07] some folks restored back to the book of
[1:35:08] Acts
[1:35:10] it seemed good unto us being assembled
[1:35:13] with one Accord just send chosen men
[1:35:14] unto you was our beloved Barnabas and
[1:35:17] Paul men that have hazarded the lives in
[1:35:20] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:35:23] have sinned what
[1:35:26] you mean they felt like they had the
[1:35:29] authority
[1:35:30] to send people
[1:35:35] it did because they were the government
[1:35:38] of God on the Earth
[1:35:44] it's that joke she hang on for a few
[1:35:46] minutes
[1:35:47] this is
[1:35:54] it whatever you bind on a who's ever
[1:35:57] sins you remit they are remitted whoever
[1:36:01] sins you retain
[1:36:05] they are retained
[1:36:07] you don't know what kind of horrible
[1:36:09] feeling that is
[1:36:11] when you stand in that predicament
[1:36:14] when you know God will hold people
[1:36:16] accountable for something they've done
[1:36:19] and you can't even pray for forgiveness
[1:36:22] for them
[1:36:26] I'm not talking about church sanity
[1:36:28] anytime I come to church and everybody's
[1:36:30] smiling around and waving I'm talking
[1:36:32] about us being a Bible believing
[1:36:40] oh my goodness
[1:36:43] notice verse 27 we have
[1:36:47] sent
[1:36:48] therefore Judas and Silas who shall also
[1:36:52] tell you the same things by mouths
[1:36:55] huh
[1:36:56] so you mean these men didn't take it on
[1:36:58] their own
[1:37:00] they were sent from the church
[1:37:03] First Corinthians 4 17. Paul now the
[1:37:07] church age messenger for this cause have
[1:37:10] I sent unto you
[1:37:13] timotheus which is Timothy
[1:37:16] you mean Paul sent people
[1:37:20] Paul sent people
[1:37:22] you mean the real god-called ministers
[1:37:27] could actually work with Brothers in
[1:37:29] their Church
[1:37:30] they'll say brother we'd like to expand
[1:37:32] our work some of your brothers I'm
[1:37:34] getting too old to fly overseas any of
[1:37:36] your brothers got a burden to go here
[1:37:38] and there and there what about Kenya
[1:37:40] what about Tanzania what about uh China
[1:37:42] what about here or there there
[1:37:45] if you have a burden and I can see that
[1:37:47] in your heart I will wreck amend you
[1:37:51] to go
[1:37:54] he said that's the nomination no that's
[1:37:57] the original plan before there was ever
[1:37:59] a denomination
[1:38:03] oh my goodness
[1:38:05] for this cause have I sent unto you to
[1:38:08] mosius who is my beloved Son
[1:38:11] faithful in the Lord he shall bring into
[1:38:14] your remembrance of my ways which be in
[1:38:16] Christ as I teach everywhere in every
[1:38:20] Church Second Corinthians 8 16 but
[1:38:22] thanks be to God which put the same
[1:38:24] Earnest care Into the Heart of Titus for
[1:38:28] you
[1:38:29] for indeed he accepted the exhortation
[1:38:32] but being more forward of his own accord
[1:38:34] he went unto you and we have sent with
[1:38:39] him
[1:38:41] the brother whose praise is in the
[1:38:44] gospel throughout all the churches
[1:38:47] so where is this stuff then a preacher
[1:38:50] is going out on their own
[1:38:52] and starting their own little
[1:38:54] denomination or whatever it is well
[1:38:56] where does all this come from not from
[1:38:59] the book of Acts or Corinthians or
[1:39:01] Ephesians
[1:39:04] but if it is show me
[1:39:06] stand right now
[1:39:10] um I thought so
[1:39:13] notice
[1:39:15] it I find this so amazing in the way
[1:39:18] that Paul brings us out so we have sent
[1:39:21] him with the brother whose Praises in
[1:39:23] the gospel throughout all the churches
[1:39:26] and not that only but who was also
[1:39:29] chosen of the churches
[1:39:33] to travel
[1:39:35] with us
[1:39:38] oh my goodness
[1:39:40] you mean Paul the prophet of the age
[1:39:44] would let some of the local churches
[1:39:47] suggest
[1:39:49] that this man and this man and this man
[1:39:51] travel with them because they'd be such
[1:39:53] a blessing and such a help
[1:39:55] and Paul didn't have this known all
[1:39:57] attitude nobody tells me who travels
[1:40:00] with me I'm the prophet
[1:40:04] he would have never been the prophet hey
[1:40:05] they had that attitude
[1:40:08] my goodness
[1:40:10] can you imagine the churches chosen of
[1:40:14] the churches to travel with us
[1:40:18] with this Grace which is administered by
[1:40:21] us to the glory of the same Lord and
[1:40:24] Declaration of your ready mind
[1:40:27] Philippians 2 25. yet I suppose it
[1:40:31] necessary to send to you epaphroditus
[1:40:35] how many of these gods did Paul said
[1:40:40] you need to tell me Paul
[1:40:43] said epaphroditus Paul said onesimus
[1:40:47] Paul sent Timothy Paul sent Titus
[1:40:52] Paul
[1:40:55] at the church is sent people
[1:40:58] Prince can't you see how contrary to
[1:41:00] scripture when people get in this idea
[1:41:03] all they need to do is sit at home and
[1:41:05] listen to it they don't never go to
[1:41:07] church they don't never have no
[1:41:08] fellowship with the body they don't ever
[1:41:10] oh I'm my own person I'm an island this
[1:41:12] is not an island move this is a body
[1:41:14] move
[1:41:15] we are not the Caribbean we are not Cuba
[1:41:18] we are a body and we need one another
[1:41:21] you see if our churches were set up this
[1:41:24] way it would eliminate a lot of the
[1:41:27] stuff that goes on around us
[1:41:31] yet I suppose that necessary to send to
[1:41:35] you epaphroditus my brother and
[1:41:38] companion and labor now watch the
[1:41:40] exhortation what's he doing is giving
[1:41:42] this brother a great recommendation now
[1:41:45] this man's going to go and Minister and
[1:41:47] he's going to go preach apparently he'd
[1:41:49] never been there before so what is he
[1:41:51] going to use what are his credentials
[1:41:53] notice they don't say jump the spoke in
[1:41:55] tongues he had a vision he had all these
[1:41:57] different signs he put before the Lord
[1:41:59] and the lamb the Lord answered all those
[1:42:01] signs he has the recommendation of a man
[1:42:04] of God
[1:42:05] not to the apostolic church that's what
[1:42:08] they look for not so much us you know we
[1:42:10] just we just let whatever come by notice
[1:42:13] my brother my companion and labor fellow
[1:42:16] Soldier but your messenger and he that
[1:42:20] ministered to my wants for he longed
[1:42:24] after you all and was full of heaviness
[1:42:25] because that he had heard that you had
[1:42:28] heard that he had been sent Now watch
[1:42:30] how the sickness had actually brought a
[1:42:32] union there for indeed he was sick known
[1:42:35] to death but God had mercy on him listen
[1:42:38] this
[1:42:39] and not only on him only
[1:42:42] but on me also
[1:42:44] my goodness lest I should have sorrow
[1:42:48] upon sorrow
[1:42:51] so Paul says I sent him
[1:42:54] therefore the more carefully that when
[1:42:57] you see him again you may rejoice that I
[1:43:01] may be the less sorrowful now watch what
[1:43:03] he does he gives them him a
[1:43:05] recommendation and then he will change
[1:43:07] it and notice what he tells them now to
[1:43:09] do here it comes with this letter and
[1:43:11] he's telling them what to do receive him
[1:43:14] therefore in the Lord what's all
[1:43:17] gladness and whole such in reputation in
[1:43:22] high honor attained to our great
[1:43:25] position
[1:43:26] wow so this is an instruction from the
[1:43:30] church AIDS Messenger to be able to
[1:43:32] speak to us say the church at Philippi
[1:43:34] we've been in that day and you this
[1:43:36] brother comes through and we can tell
[1:43:38] this is Paul's handwriting this comes
[1:43:40] straight from Paul and he comes with
[1:43:42] this Mighty recommendation that he's a
[1:43:44] brother a fellow labor in the gospel
[1:43:46] well if Paul says this about him praise
[1:43:48] the lord we will receive him
[1:43:52] but what if he just comes out and say
[1:43:53] hey I heard y'all go to church over here
[1:43:55] I'd like to preach for you I believe the
[1:43:57] message
[1:43:58] I believe Malachi 4. I believe God sent
[1:44:02] a prophet every devil in hell believes
[1:44:03] that
[1:44:05] it ain't no longer we get so much
[1:44:07] garbage going on around us
[1:44:12] Colossians 4 10.
[1:44:14] our Mr Chris my fellow prisoner salutes
[1:44:17] him and Marcus sister son to Barnabas
[1:44:21] now this was Marcus which was Saint Mark
[1:44:24] touching him who you received
[1:44:27] Commandments if he come unto you receive
[1:44:31] him you mean this was a common practice
[1:44:34] recommendation letters of commendation
[1:44:36] you understand so what is Paul doing
[1:44:39] Paul does not want them people to only
[1:44:42] read his books he wants them to hear
[1:44:46] other God call men well if God started
[1:44:49] out his church that way he ain't going
[1:44:51] to end it by just praying the prophet's
[1:44:52] tapes
[1:44:53] and somebody said
[1:44:55] God never started his church out that
[1:44:58] way and he ain't going to end it up that
[1:45:00] way but he's going to end it up the same
[1:45:02] way that he started with one man
[1:45:05] receiving the word for the age others
[1:45:07] going out called by the same Holy Ghost
[1:45:10] preaching the same message bringing up
[1:45:13] the very end time as it started that was
[1:45:16] the alpha this is the Omega
[1:45:18] [Applause]
[1:45:21] oh my now notice this brother if he come
[1:45:25] unto you receive him now you can tell by
[1:45:27] the way Paul is writing this that he's
[1:45:28] not really sure which the way this
[1:45:29] brother is going to go notice in
[1:45:31] Philemon chapter 1 verse 10 I beseech
[1:45:34] thee from my son onesimus who I have
[1:45:37] begotten in my bonds which in time
[1:45:40] passed
[1:45:41] was to thee unprofitable wow we got to
[1:45:45] watch these preachers they will they
[1:45:46] will tell the good and the Bad and the
[1:45:48] Ugly on you won't they now I don't know
[1:45:49] how much you know about onesimus but
[1:45:51] anessimus was a runaway slave
[1:45:54] and whenever he'd run away from his
[1:45:56] master then Paul was able to meet him
[1:45:58] and Paul was Able by the grace of God to
[1:46:01] bring this man to a true conversion and
[1:46:03] Paul actually writes back a letter to
[1:46:06] the owner of the slave and he says
[1:46:08] anything that he's done wrong lay it to
[1:46:11] my church whatever's happened whatever
[1:46:13] he's done but now Paul is going to send
[1:46:15] forth this brother can you imagine how
[1:46:17] this guy had quite a reputation but if
[1:46:19] there's anybody that can help remove
[1:46:21] this brother's bad reputation it's a
[1:46:25] master builder because he knows how to
[1:46:27] take words and assemble them together
[1:46:30] orchestrated by the spirit of God and
[1:46:32] watch it go straight to the hearts of
[1:46:34] God's sheep and watch that hard Feeling
[1:46:36] Just dissipate why he's a master builder
[1:46:39] he ain't building a house made of steel
[1:46:42] and stone and wood and Clay but he's
[1:46:44] taking Revelation by Revelation by
[1:46:47] Revelation and laying that inside the
[1:46:49] hearts of the Saints I beseech thee for
[1:46:52] my son on Nissim assume I have begotten
[1:46:55] in my bonds which in time passed was to
[1:46:57] the unprofitable but now profitable to
[1:47:00] thee and to me what's the recommendation
[1:47:03] now whom I have sent again thou
[1:47:08] therefore receive him receive him you
[1:47:12] mean this was an Apostolic practice well
[1:47:15] according to what I've read to you
[1:47:16] tonight it was so they would send out
[1:47:18] these preachers and they would go forth
[1:47:21] and preach and they would go as new
[1:47:23] works and go here and there and there
[1:47:25] and it was help holding back and holding
[1:47:28] down a lot of the error that they undo
[1:47:31] inevitably would come you know what
[1:47:33] amazes me the prophet of God that come
[1:47:36] in this day followed in that same
[1:47:38] pattern
[1:47:40] now brother random knew that his message
[1:47:42] was going to be relatively new to the
[1:47:45] world to us it's not new it's a
[1:47:47] restoration but to the world it would be
[1:47:50] relatively new and it would be a lot of
[1:47:53] people coming out of systems coming out
[1:47:57] of things they were into so it's got to
[1:47:59] be so careful how he lays the initial
[1:48:02] stages of this message so if they leave
[1:48:06] their denomination was hate in their
[1:48:08] heart and they leave their denomination
[1:48:11] with a lack of respect and they leave
[1:48:14] their denomination with a smart attitude
[1:48:17] and a know-it-all attitude then they
[1:48:19] bring that in and that becomes the
[1:48:22] foundation of the new move
[1:48:24] you understand so the foundation is so
[1:48:28] important
[1:48:30] March is a very special month to me
[1:48:33] March the 27th 1983 I stood in my
[1:48:37] Pentecostal Church down in Kentucky and
[1:48:39] introduced the message March the 27th
[1:48:42] 1983 so next week being what 40 years
[1:48:45] so it's a very special time to me so
[1:48:48] sometime after that I had brother
[1:48:50] Willard Collins to come from the Branham
[1:48:51] Tabernacle many of you have heard his
[1:48:53] name he's actually brother Paul Phillips
[1:48:54] grandfather and brother Paul actually
[1:48:57] came down with him just as a younger guy
[1:48:59] of course and whenever he was there I
[1:49:02] assemble the Collins he was going to
[1:49:03] speak for us and I said would you share
[1:49:04] some things with me and my family or
[1:49:07] things that you saw things that you
[1:49:09] heard being around brother Brennan now
[1:49:10] he told me several different things but
[1:49:12] he told me this and it always stood out
[1:49:15] to me I never knew why he told me but
[1:49:17] I've shared it with people all over the
[1:49:18] world pertaining to different
[1:49:20] circumstances in their life brother
[1:49:22] Collins was a ministerial uh study guy
[1:49:26] y'all heard of the Revival so-called
[1:49:28] that's been going on down in Asbury
[1:49:29] College in Kentucky you all heard about
[1:49:31] that a Methodist call is down there okay
[1:49:33] some of you have uh brother Collins
[1:49:35] actually that's where he came from so it
[1:49:38] was a Seminary Student he was a
[1:49:41] Methodist so he come to the message and
[1:49:43] actually did he felt that he had to
[1:49:46] leave and pull away from them not
[1:49:47] re-baptize and all of that so he said
[1:49:49] that he went to Brother Branham and said
[1:49:51] brother Branham how should I leave
[1:49:54] how should I leave the Methodist Church
[1:49:57] he said by the Collins
[1:49:59] leave as Peaceable
[1:50:03] as possible
[1:50:05] wow now this is not going to be deep
[1:50:07] okay you won't need your life jacket you
[1:50:10] won't need a boat because it's so deep
[1:50:11] it's going to be over the top of your
[1:50:12] head it's going to be so simple leave as
[1:50:16] Peaceable as possible
[1:50:18] go to them people and thank them for
[1:50:21] everything they have done for you thank
[1:50:24] them for the years that they have let's
[1:50:27] use you and their churches and it went
[1:50:29] through a whole bunch of stuff and I
[1:50:30] thought wow what a way to deal with him
[1:50:34] not to me that's not just a way to leave
[1:50:35] a church but that's the way just dealing
[1:50:38] with Humanity in a congenial nice
[1:50:41] Christian way now you'll imagine you're
[1:50:44] walking there yeah about the devils
[1:50:46] you're nothing but serpency I am now
[1:50:50] following the prophet of Malachi 4 I
[1:50:53] indict the whole Methodist generation I
[1:50:55] got you all you're going to hell well
[1:50:58] now that would have been real respect on
[1:50:59] it
[1:51:02] it's amazing how many message folks
[1:51:04] still don't know how to leave the church
[1:51:08] it's amazing how they don't even know
[1:51:11] how to treat one another
[1:51:13] and treat the Sinners out here
[1:51:15] look friends be kind to them it's the
[1:51:18] only kindness some of them will ever
[1:51:19] have
[1:51:20] you can't go wrong by being nice to
[1:51:22] people the Bible teaches us such
[1:51:24] I want you to notice then when brother
[1:51:26] Brandon was here he's preaching a
[1:51:28] controversial message and he has a great
[1:51:30] phenomenal Ministry of course as we know
[1:51:32] a miracle signs wonders things like that
[1:51:34] and it causes people to be drawn toward
[1:51:37] him and and many different Avenues of
[1:51:39] life and he knows this so now brother
[1:51:41] Branham is going to be faced with a
[1:51:44] dilemma how do I deal with some of these
[1:51:48] people that have seen what I'm preaching
[1:51:49] and they're coming out of those systems
[1:51:51] how am I going to deal with them what
[1:51:53] what what should I say how should I do
[1:51:55] it now if he lays the wrong Foundation
[1:51:59] and if he raises this message out of
[1:52:03] rebellion
[1:52:04] hatred standing against all the
[1:52:07] preachers
[1:52:09] will they ever get rid of that attitude
[1:52:11] or will they not come into the same
[1:52:13] message with this attitude of rebellion
[1:52:16] and standing against everything and
[1:52:19] everybody
[1:52:21] notice this
[1:52:23] Queen of the South 1958. now Sunday we
[1:52:27] don't ask people to leave their post to
[1:52:29] duty unless the church has fully
[1:52:31] cooperated and you have no services at
[1:52:34] your church we're here as a visitor we
[1:52:37] don't want to pull anyone from their
[1:52:40] post of Duty ah sounds like Apollos
[1:52:43] we're trying to help that church grow
[1:52:45] and we want every member at his own
[1:52:49] church wow and we want every member of
[1:52:52] his own church and if you have sickness
[1:52:54] and you want to be prayed for tomorrow
[1:52:56] night
[1:52:57] oh dear God don't tell me he said this
[1:53:06] but do message people have this loyalty
[1:53:08] to their position
[1:53:11] no
[1:53:13] why
[1:53:15] well there's one of two things if you've
[1:53:17] never heard this before or you've heard
[1:53:19] it and you simply don't believe it
[1:53:24] huh
[1:53:26] permission from your pastor
[1:53:31] tell him what you want to do wow now he
[1:53:35] knows he's calling out
[1:53:37] so if he said if he tells you not to
[1:53:40] come and be prayed for he's an old devil
[1:53:42] anyhow y'all just come on God and if
[1:53:44] that person comes to the message what
[1:53:46] kind of attitude do you think they're
[1:53:47] going to come with boxing gloves on
[1:53:51] don't tell me bless God I'll tell you
[1:53:53] one thing I'm not my last Pastor out I
[1:53:55] certainly care to knock you out Donnie
[1:53:56] Reagan
[1:54:00] can I go on thank you
[1:54:03] now if your church is having church
[1:54:05] tomorrow night you sick
[1:54:07] just ask your pastor
[1:54:10] I'm sure he would excuse you to come if
[1:54:13] you don't get into the line or get
[1:54:15] prayed for tonight
[1:54:17] wow
[1:54:20] some of you maybe wrote me letters and I
[1:54:22] answered the best that I could now the
[1:54:24] questions you ask me and Doctrine I
[1:54:26] referred you back to your pastor
[1:54:30] you see because I I don't do that it's
[1:54:32] nice I appreciate you putting that much
[1:54:34] confidence but you see all of us would
[1:54:36] agree or on Basics agree on the same
[1:54:38] thing but each man maybe two or three
[1:54:40] sitting here wouldn't and I'd say ask
[1:54:42] your pastor see because sometimes it
[1:54:45] causes a little friction in the church
[1:54:49] and we definitely want that
[1:54:51] because we want all you people to come
[1:54:54] out of them churches and leave them and
[1:54:56] we're we're here to bust up every Church
[1:54:58] in the country
[1:55:02] well what I'd like to know is if brother
[1:55:04] Branham didn't say that where does that
[1:55:06] Spirit come from
[1:55:07] and it's been among us since this
[1:55:09] message started
[1:55:14] oh Jesus
[1:55:19] brother by himself a little friction in
[1:55:21] the church and we don't want that now
[1:55:24] this is what he wanted we want you to be
[1:55:28] in Harmony and one Accord
[1:55:31] now I'm fixing to tell you what song
[1:55:33] your pastor is like
[1:55:35] I think of your pastor like the song
[1:55:38] Amazing Grace
[1:55:40] it was grace that brought me safe thus
[1:55:43] far and Grace will take me on
[1:55:47] so here's the way brother Branham
[1:55:49] likened the god called pastors it was
[1:55:51] grace that brought you safe thus far and
[1:55:54] Grace that'll take you on well why does
[1:55:56] not he incite the people to Rebellion
[1:56:00] and dropped the doctrine of serpency and
[1:56:03] dropped the doctrine of marriage and
[1:56:05] divorce and this and that and this I
[1:56:07] don't care I'm going to preach it anyhow
[1:56:08] bless God I feel led to tell it
[1:56:11] to it I'm here to call out a pride
[1:56:14] careful brother Bynum
[1:56:17] you're laying the foundation
[1:56:22] now a lot of men have come in and
[1:56:24] they've laid this on the foundation and
[1:56:26] that on the foundation and that on the
[1:56:28] foundation
[1:56:29] total different attitude and spirit than
[1:56:32] the master builder of our age
[1:56:34] I hate to say it but it's the scripture
[1:56:36] so I've got to
[1:56:38] some men's work will be burned and
[1:56:41] annihilated
[1:56:43] but they themselves will be saved
[1:56:47] so as by far
[1:56:50] I just quoted to you a scripture
[1:56:55] oh my
[1:56:57] notice this again Jezebel religion 1961
[1:57:01] now this is one of Brothers favorite
[1:57:02] places he had great favor among these
[1:57:03] people I've actually talked to some of
[1:57:05] the people years ago whenever I first
[1:57:06] went up to this part of the country that
[1:57:08] was there in those meetings so many
[1:57:10] people writes me questions about
[1:57:11] marriage and divorce and so forth which
[1:57:13] is a tangle in the church and I always
[1:57:14] refer him back and say ask your pastor
[1:57:16] people wrote me letters here and said
[1:57:18] what about this and what about that I'll
[1:57:20] refer the letter back you get it see
[1:57:22] your pastor on little things because
[1:57:24] after all he's your Shepherd he's the
[1:57:26] one that God sent to watch over you wow
[1:57:28] wow and we might disagree on it then
[1:57:31] that causes
[1:57:34] oh I saw confusion and the church was
[1:57:36] was God doing it
[1:57:40] watch what some people think
[1:57:44] wow
[1:57:45] huh
[1:57:48] we don't want that no no we just want
[1:57:52] you to quit doing things that's sinful
[1:57:55] things out of the Bible keep moving on
[1:57:57] and you cause little frictions and
[1:57:59] things like that that upsets the church
[1:58:02] you mean brother Branham is concerned
[1:58:04] about the church being upset and
[1:58:07] frictions in the church brother M don't
[1:58:09] think that's okay
[1:58:15] so I'd rather your pastor tell you about
[1:58:17] marriage and divorce and these things
[1:58:19] and them things let him do it he's God's
[1:58:21] servant
[1:58:22] he's a clip to do it
[1:58:24] can anybody just at least squeak out it
[1:58:29] thank you
[1:58:31] now many of you people are writing me
[1:58:33] letters now wait a minute why didn't
[1:58:35] brother Branham say well the people are
[1:58:36] pulling me into it
[1:58:38] like apologies I didn't want to do it I
[1:58:41] didn't want to do it but I had to I had
[1:58:43] to do this I had to do it
[1:58:46] that's a deceived individual
[1:58:49] anyone who thinks God would lead them to
[1:58:53] break his Bible
[1:58:55] a very deceived
[1:58:59] that includes me you you you or anyone
[1:59:02] else
[1:59:04] God never leads any of us over the
[1:59:07] pattern of his word some wonder how many
[1:59:10] of our message churches have this
[1:59:11] Foundation
[1:59:13] that I've read to you tonight
[1:59:19] is it any wonder that over time the
[1:59:21] collapse you see a church built upon
[1:59:23] this Foundation of rebellion and
[1:59:26] disobeying God's word
[1:59:33] and it's heartbreaking because some men
[1:59:35] pour years into it and they've built
[1:59:38] upon a foundation
[1:59:40] sand
[1:59:42] and their labor and they sweat
[1:59:46] always felt so sorry for women pastors
[1:59:51] I mean first of all they ain't even
[1:59:52] called
[1:59:53] you imagine all the prayer all the sweat
[1:59:55] and all the preaching and I've seen some
[1:59:57] of them that could preach better than
[1:59:58] some men I knew
[2:00:00] that's a Marvel I mean we used to live
[2:00:01] in West Virginia and there's a woman a
[2:00:03] woman preacher there and she was one of
[2:00:04] Carol's favorite preachers
[2:00:05] [Laughter]
[2:00:08] because the woman really had some
[2:00:10] understanding it's your girl I mean she
[2:00:12] really had some understanding she wasn't
[2:00:13] just an ABC preacher she got down to XYZ
[2:00:16] and she wasn't even called to do it and
[2:00:18] she fought such burdens and she was
[2:00:20] under such a heavy load all the time I
[2:00:22] thought it ain't no wonder woman get
[2:00:24] home bake some pumpkin pies or apple or
[2:00:26] do something you ain't supposed to be
[2:00:28] preaching
[2:00:29] but can you imagine what a woman
[2:00:31] preacher stands before God and maybe
[2:00:33] she'll be saved and she will absolutely
[2:00:35] lose every bit of that work because she
[2:00:39] overstepped God's word I suffer not a
[2:00:42] woman to assert authority over a man but
[2:00:44] to be in silence is also saithful law so
[2:00:48] she labor she studies she preaches in
[2:00:51] vain
[2:00:53] dear Lord
[2:00:57] oh my God help us Lord Jesus
[2:01:04] how many loves him with all your heart
[2:01:08] well if you can't stand I'll come up and
[2:01:09] pray for you
[2:01:11] if you want to you can try to Mosey up
[2:01:22] many of you write me letters I'm saying
[2:01:23] brother Branham should we do this or do
[2:01:25] that always say ask your pastor because
[2:01:27] I'll do anything I can to answer on the
[2:01:29] great fundamentally Evangelical
[2:01:30] doctrines of the Bible but when it comes
[2:01:32] to that should we do this or that always
[2:01:34] refer to your pastor each man or there
[2:01:36] isn't two here but what would disagree
[2:01:37] with one of the other little technical
[2:01:39] things whether we should comb our hair
[2:01:41] on the right side or the left and mine I
[2:01:43] have no trouble he says
[2:01:47] but you know what I mean when we have
[2:01:48] those things so I always just say
[2:01:51] every congregation ask your pastor
[2:01:55] if he's let you far enough to be saved
[2:01:58] and filled with the Holy Ghost can't you
[2:02:01] trust him the rest of the way through
[2:02:03] if God honored him for that
[2:02:06] or why isn't he
[2:02:08] telling all of them to flee and leave
[2:02:11] can't you see
[2:02:12] the attitudes you leave in
[2:02:15] you will take with you
[2:02:17] and you will rejoin
[2:02:19] and rebuild
[2:02:21] what's that attitude
[2:02:23] so if it's hatred variance emulation
[2:02:26] strife
[2:02:28] they don't make what happens what you
[2:02:30] think you're led to do
[2:02:32] look at what's following you
[2:02:35] look at the fruit
[2:02:37] always had people told people to wrap me
[2:02:39] questions outside of what I preach on
[2:02:41] the platform here's my secretary what
[2:02:43] about this what about that ask your
[2:02:44] pastor if he let you this far until you
[2:02:47] receive the Holy Ghost he'll take you on
[2:02:49] ask your pastor
[2:02:51] you see because little things like that
[2:02:53] causes confusion therefore I leave away
[2:02:57] from it you mean brother Branham the
[2:02:59] messenger
[2:03:00] the seventh angel
[2:03:02] people may ask him the question he had
[2:03:04] the right answer and he wouldn't answer
[2:03:05] it because it would cause confusion in
[2:03:08] the church and yet many of our message
[2:03:09] preachers they don't care how much
[2:03:10] confusion they call that okay how much
[2:03:12] division
[2:03:15] I hate to be some of them friends I
[2:03:16] don't mind telling you
[2:03:18] I just heard of one
[2:03:20] in South Africa last week that I went
[2:03:22] into a church under a terrible
[2:03:24] circumstance a brother that had a pastor
[2:03:26] that had been there forever had a
[2:03:28] debilitating situation
[2:03:30] and a preacher right from among them
[2:03:32] went in and while this pastor was sick
[2:03:34] and going through so many things
[2:03:37] and divide that church
[2:03:39] take advantage if that Pastor Ever
[2:03:41] Needed people to stand with him
[2:03:44] it was then
[2:03:46] when they turn and walk away from him
[2:03:49] and eventually the brother died and some
[2:03:51] of the people telling me about it said
[2:03:53] they thought it was the breakup the
[2:03:55] finally just killed him
[2:04:01] that preacher and then people
[2:04:03] will stand before God
[2:04:09] friends this is serious
[2:04:11] church is serious Church ain't like a
[2:04:14] grocery store well I think I'll be over
[2:04:17] here I was thinking over there you
[2:04:18] better not go anywhere until almighty
[2:04:21] God tells you himself well I feel that
[2:04:24] well if you feel led the prophet of God
[2:04:26] said if you ever feel led to do anything
[2:04:28] put it with the word and consult your
[2:04:30] pastor but you know what people don't
[2:04:32] even believe that one either do they
[2:04:35] do you understand what it's going to be
[2:04:37] that day when people walk before God
[2:04:40] and they're going to be judged by this
[2:04:42] message brother they've heard preached
[2:04:45] we make fun of these out here I ain't
[2:04:47] worried so much about them I'm worried
[2:04:49] about us
[2:04:51] we say we believe this and we look down
[2:04:53] our noses at people who don't
[2:04:56] you only believe how much you obey
[2:05:02] let me say it again you only really
[2:05:05] believe how much
[2:05:08] you obey
[2:05:10] same for me
[2:05:11] or anybody else
[2:05:15] Well everybody's mad at me could take me
[2:05:17] out and buy me for supper tomorrow night
[2:05:20] or we could have one over here I guess
[2:05:23] except all of you that's mad please
[2:05:24] don't cook anything I'm gonna have a
[2:05:26] belly ache after church
[2:05:30] don't you love him since
[2:05:32] about it
[2:05:34] think about it what Satan tried to do
[2:05:36] he's done it down Through the Ages our
[2:05:39] church isn't exempt from it brother Tim
[2:05:41] preach Church isn't brother on Spencer
[2:05:42] No Church in the message is exempt from
[2:05:45] Satan trying to destroy us
[2:05:47] but a lot of it is up to us if we will
[2:05:51] allow it the Corinthian Church going to
[2:05:54] stop this in its tracks but they were
[2:05:57] the very ones Satan was using do you
[2:05:59] understand that the church people could
[2:06:01] stop all these false preachers
[2:06:03] a lot of these preachers that ain't bit
[2:06:04] more sin of God than the man the Moon is
[2:06:06] and the church people could stop it
[2:06:08] don't listen to them they're off the
[2:06:11] word don't give them the time of day
[2:06:14] but instead of doing it they follow them
[2:06:16] around
[2:06:20] God help us
[2:06:23] about his death
[2:06:28] oh my
[2:06:32] God says he was in a prayer line the
[2:06:34] other night
[2:06:35] and he said the biggest majority of the
[2:06:37] people that led across the platform to
[2:06:39] it
[2:06:40] by the time they got to him they were
[2:06:42] already healed
[2:06:44] they said because their pastors were
[2:06:45] sending their praying for him
[2:06:47] and by the time they got to him God had
[2:06:49] already moved for them
[2:06:51] why God heard their prayers
[2:06:56] Heavenly Father
[2:06:59] I pray you would help us Lord
[2:07:03] may we go back to our
[2:07:06] Foundation
[2:07:08] maybe look tonight Lord and who we are
[2:07:11] and where we are and what we believe and
[2:07:14] why we believe it
[2:07:17] that we believe your Bible do we believe
[2:07:19] the apostolic pattern
[2:07:22] all how we've seen Satan
[2:07:25] divide separate down Through the Ages
[2:07:30] you knew it would come
[2:07:32] oh yeah you could have stopped it but
[2:07:34] you didn't
[2:07:35] because you knew there were people in
[2:07:37] there that didn't really believe
[2:07:41] and you would let false teachers get
[2:07:43] among them
[2:07:44] to pull them away from the real body
[2:07:48] Lord God I pray you would help us Jesus
[2:07:51] if you see anything in me tonight Lord
[2:07:53] that displeases you
[2:07:55] please show me
[2:07:58] there's anything in my foundational
[2:07:59] belief
[2:08:02] God help me I go back and dig it up
[2:08:06] I Want to Be Right Lord
[2:08:09] may you look at every man woman boy and
[2:08:11] girl in this place tonight may we
[2:08:15] open our hearts and our souls to you and
[2:08:17] say Lord search us
[2:08:20] we don't want our work to be in vain
[2:08:23] so a preacher could give a great portion
[2:08:26] of his life
[2:08:28] and yet wind up his work be destroyed
[2:08:31] and burned
[2:08:32] the same master builder wrote that
[2:08:36] and said every man's work will be tried
[2:08:38] as by far
[2:08:40] so if a man built upon this Foundation
[2:08:42] would hey stubble the fire will try his
[2:08:46] work
[2:08:47] and if it will not stand the test of the
[2:08:49] fire his work will be destroyed yet he
[2:08:52] himself will be saved
[2:08:54] yet so as my father
[2:08:58] Lord I don't want that to be me I don't
[2:09:00] want that to be these people
[2:09:03] I don't want our work to be annihilated
[2:09:06] and destroyed
[2:09:08] because we got in permissive will we
[2:09:11] built upon a foundation other than your
[2:09:13] word and we lay wood hay stubble Pride
[2:09:16] arrogance emulation strife
[2:09:18] on the top of a stone foundation how
[2:09:21] come stone at Heritage Strife how can
[2:09:24] Stone be cemented to arrogance
[2:09:27] how can Stone be submitted cemented
[2:09:30] rather to Personal Agenda Keep Me Lord
[2:09:34] must be one stone upon another
[2:09:37] search US Lord
[2:09:39] Try Us Lord
[2:09:41] look at us dear God
[2:09:44] begin with me I'm the shepherd
[2:09:47] look at my heart

[2:10:10] children

[2:10:14] we don't want to work to be burned and
[2:10:17] destroyed and then we stand before you
[2:10:18] that day
[2:10:20] empty-handed some of these preachers
[2:10:22] that think they're doing so much
[2:10:25] and all they brought is division and
[2:10:28] separation among the body
[2:10:30] and they'll stand before you that day
[2:10:33] and not have one thing
[2:10:36] to present to you
[2:10:38] how sad
[2:10:40] how sad
[2:10:43] search us tonight Lord God I pray in the
[2:10:46] name of Jesus
[2:10:49] oh Father
[2:10:51] we want our work to be tried
[2:10:55] so we can be true
[2:10:57] we want our hearts to be faithful
[2:11:00] if you see any motive in me that's wrong
[2:11:02] and the objective
[2:11:05] any opportunistic ideas or opinions
[2:11:10] show me Lord
[2:11:11] I'll make it right
[2:11:14] oh Jesus May our church be built upon
[2:11:18] the rock of your word and if it is all
[2:11:21] hail can Prevail against it but it will
[2:11:24] never overcome us
[2:11:26] all hell may try and May
[2:11:28] challenge every individual here a lot
[2:11:30] never before but if we're built upon
[2:11:33] your word there's not enough devils in
[2:11:35] all of hell
[2:11:36] that can destroy your church
[2:11:41] Carol was reading to me the other day
[2:11:43] Lord where they put it in the new church
[2:11:45] director and how the church was started
[2:11:47] and I was told her so I'm so glad they
[2:11:49] did that to give the people an idea of
[2:11:52] kind of where it started from
[2:11:55] originated all those years ago in the
[2:11:57] 60s and started from a little small
[2:12:00] group and then grew and grew from one
[2:12:02] stage to another to another to another
[2:12:04] to where we are today
[2:12:06] where would we be today father had it
[2:12:08] not been for some of those forefathers
[2:12:11] they had a hard time they went through
[2:12:14] difficult challenges many of them that
[2:12:15] she was reading about I didn't even know
[2:12:18] them of course
