[37:12] her part for the great king is fixin to
[37:16] take her as his own possession so much
[37:20] different than us and our wedding night
[37:24] which is truly where we are many of us
[37:27] have been here for quite some time
[37:30] we've been married to the Lord Jesus and
[37:32] this night
[37:34] been prolonged for some it's decades for
[37:38] some of you maybe 5 10 15 years for some
[37:42] of you it's 20 30 40 that you've
[37:45] actually been in this night with the
[37:48] King you have been able by the Spirit of
[37:51] God to shut the outside world from your
[37:54] soul you've been able by the power of
[37:57] transformation to move into a sphere
[38:00] into the realm of eternity where
[38:03] mortality has broke from your soul and
[38:06] you've truly been born again by the
[38:09] breath of Jehovah but yet because you
[38:13] are a creature of time you're still held
[38:17] captive by these elements that's in your
[38:20] body which have not yet been saved in
[38:24] your soul your soar in heavenly places
[38:26] in your body and your spirit you battle
[38:30] you deal with sickness and disease and
[38:32] trouble heartache day in and day out get
[38:37] one thing resolved and three more things
[38:40] takes its place you get that taken care
[38:42] of and something else comes against you
[38:45] so your wedding night the setting of it
[38:48] is somewhat different than hers when she
[38:52] went into this beautiful place which had
[38:54] been renovated for this specific cause
[38:57] and purpose nothing was quite like it no
[39:00] doubt that she had ever seen she'd moved
[39:03] into this place to be able to receive
[39:07] the very life of the king himself he had
[39:12] used this room many times no doubt but
[39:15] it had been renovated or transformed to
[39:19] be able to meet her and his particular
[39:22] need and that was a bridal chamber
[39:26] unlike what we go through today that the
[39:30] servants were on the outside the people
[39:33] who was making revelry and whatever more
[39:36] they were without the palace inside this
[39:40] room it was her and him alone truly it
[39:45] can be reflected in a
[39:46] mirror image of how we are in our soul
[39:50] but in the natural realm it is so much
[39:53] different friends the world about us
[39:57] constantly was an onslaught of trying to
[40:01] mold us shape us and conform us into
[40:05] their image we are living in a world
[40:08] that constantly is being changed many of
[40:12] us that are 40 50 60 years old even some
[40:14] younger than that you have seen so many
[40:17] changes in this world that we are living
[40:20] in in the political way in the social
[40:22] way in so many ways the world is being
[40:26] changed and many I'm afraid feel life
[40:29] that they are not pulled toward the
[40:31] world because they dress different from
[40:34] the world and that's a set value with
[40:36] many of us many of you do not dress in
[40:39] the fashions of the world or ungodly
[40:42] sayings and you feel like you're free
[40:44] from the conforming of the world and
[40:47] when you get to that place you're in a
[40:49] very dangerous situation because Satan
[40:53] simply changes his way about which he
[40:56] wants to conform us and pull us into the
[40:59] imagery or our behavior or things which
[41:03] will resemble the world but yet a person
[41:07] can resemble the world in their
[41:08] mannerism and their habit and certain
[41:11] other things that they do and yet on the
[41:13] outward appearance nothing like the
[41:16] world at all they don't smoke they don't
[41:18] drink they don't go to worldly places
[41:20] they got their mannerisms their behavior
[41:23] and much of what is around them is being
[41:26] changed day by day now let us look back
[41:29] at this again in 2nd Corinthians chapter
[41:31] 3 verse 9 Paul says for if the
[41:35] ministration of condemnation be glory
[41:37] much more to see ministration of
[41:39] righteousness exceeding glory for even
[41:42] that which was made glorious had no
[41:44] glory in this respect by reason of the
[41:48] glory that excels now here he's talking
[41:50] about of course the law which was given
[41:53] to the children of Israel and the glory
[41:54] was so great that is shined upon the
[41:57] face of
[41:58] and so much that they had to put a veil
[41:59] over Moses face because of the glory it
[42:03] was a shared glory as the moon shares
[42:06] the glory of the Sun now we know the
[42:09] moon actually has no glory of her own
[42:12] but it is a reflected glory which is
[42:15] borrowed from the Sun itself and when
[42:18] the moon turns around of course and
[42:19] reveals itself in four stages it is
[42:22] because that the darkness of the earth
[42:24] or the shadow of the earth is hitting on
[42:26] the moon in a certain way and it
[42:28] produces first quarter second quarter
[42:30] third quarter and then it moves around
[42:32] to where it is a full moon again simply
[42:35] because it is a borrowed light if she
[42:37] had her own light then the shadow of the
[42:40] earth would not be able to reflect it in
[42:42] the way that it does so Moses when he
[42:44] comes down from the mountain it is a
[42:46] borrowed light from the glory of God and
[42:49] Paul talks about how great that glory
[42:51] was but he said the glory that was to
[42:54] come which is the glory of the gospel
[42:56] exceeds that glory because it Exelis
[43:00] that glory and the church said now we
[43:03] know that the gospel as well is revealed
[43:06] in glory stages in so much said it
[43:10] wasn't was revealed in the book of Acts
[43:11] initially and the Spirit of God fell
[43:13] upon the original Church God could share
[43:15] his glory in that it was the firstfruits
[43:18] of the resurrection or the wave sheaf
[43:21] become fifty days after his own
[43:23] resurrection and Jesus being the
[43:25] firstfruits of the humanity that was
[43:28] raised from the dead but whenever God
[43:30] now knew that it would not last in that
[43:32] stage it would go down to the dark ages
[43:34] of the church ages and die and be raised
[43:37] again so it has been exceeding in glory
[43:40] from Luther from Wesley to Pentecost up
[43:43] to where we are tonight we believe on
[43:45] the final phase do we not now that glory
[43:47] of loser would have no glory by reason
[43:51] of the glory which excelled so if you
[43:54] would compare a flashlight to a new LED
[43:57] light well there's hardly no comparison
[43:59] at all if you compare most of the bulbs
[44:02] that you and I were raised with the CFLs
[44:05] and our lot or the incandescent light
[44:06] bulbs that you and I had our
[44:08] if it was a hundred watt bulb then it
[44:11] burned a hundred watts but now a hundred
[44:13] watt and an LED equivalent will burn
[44:16] about 1718 something like this so you're
[44:19] burning 1718 watts but because it is a
[44:23] total new design by the LED it is much
[44:27] more is much more efficient and you get
[44:29] a brighter light and actually you get
[44:31] more life because when it turns on it
[44:34] does not put the surge to it the way
[44:36] that the incandescent bulb it so that
[44:38] glide now is it a life it is a vintage
[44:41] of course incandescent will be out
[44:42] phased out nobody'll even want them
[44:44] anymore because they blow easier they're
[44:47] much easier to be able to the filament
[44:49] to break on the inside it's the same way
[44:51] with looser wetsy and Pentecost was it
[44:54] alight in that day it was but it was
[44:56] like a very dense incandescent compared
[44:59] to a light bright illuminating LED light
[45:02] in this day praise the Lord
[45:05] now I'm worried about you little
[45:06] energizer bunny we just keep on running
[45:09] and we never run down so it's not like
[45:11] that we've got to have revival come
[45:13] through and this man comes in and brings
[45:14] a revival we have revival within
[45:17] ourselves now we need syrup of course we
[45:19] know that but there's a pile this life
[45:21] that's on the inside that is the glory
[45:24] that excels even that opit accost I
[45:27] remember the days of Pentecost whenever
[45:28] you had to get an advances to come
[45:30] around get the people all fired up again
[45:32] it lasts for a few weeks or months or
[45:34] maybe six weeks and then you'd have to
[45:36] get another and come in and fire them
[45:37] all up some folks around the Misses are
[45:39] still that way today
[45:40] but if you ever get the real baptism of
[45:42] the Holy Ghost you have living wells of
[45:44] water inside of you that's what he said
[45:47] about the Shulamite that's the real
[45:48] bride now notice this in verse 11 for if
[45:51] that which is done away was glorious
[45:54] much more that which remaineth is
[45:57] glorious and verse 15 but even unto this
[46:00] day when Moses is read the veil is upon
[46:03] their heart now I was talking about the
[46:05] children visit whenever they read Moses
[46:08] or the law whenever they do read that
[46:10] the value which was symbolic on Moses
[46:13] face it's now transferred upon the
[46:15] hearts of the Jews so they now
[46:18] bearing the image of the veil so it was
[46:20] mailed to them and now it's failed again
[46:23] but what if God reversed that in that he
[46:26] unveiled the veil in Christ and then
[46:29] those who now look upon him they are not
[46:31] looking upon him in the veil sense but
[46:33] they also are unveiled as well now
[46:36] because Moses was veiled those who read
[46:39] it now are veiled
[46:40] because Christ was unveil those have
[46:43] become his seen by the baptism of the
[46:45] Holy Ghost they have become quicken then
[46:48] they also are unveiled as well
[46:50] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[46:52] Lord the veil shall be taken away now
[46:55] notice in verse 17 now the Lord is that
[46:57] spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord
[46:59] is there is Liberty boy have I quoted
[47:02] this for years and years and Pentecost
[47:04] and how is use that in this I heard many
[47:07] preachers use it the same way in the way
[47:09] of shouting so where the Lord is there
[47:13] is Liberty so we've come together or not
[47:15] and we're going to beat the drums and
[47:17] clap our hands and bang the tambourines
[47:19] and beat the piano and break the strings
[47:21] on the guitar and we're going to shout
[47:23] because we're the Spirit of the Lord is
[47:25] there is Liberty when you look at it in
[47:26] reality he's not even talking about
[47:28] shouting he's talking about us being
[47:31] born again and being able for the veil
[47:33] to be removed from our heart maybe we
[47:36] believe in shouting certainly we do now
[47:38] watch the Lord is that spirit and where
[47:40] the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[47:42] Liberty whether the Lord is that spirit
[47:44] and where the Spirit of the Lord is
[47:47] there is Liberty so it's not just so
[47:50] much Liberty in the service it's you
[47:53] bringing your Liberty in the service and
[47:56] the Lord is in you and you are free then
[47:59] we should be able to have a free service
[48:00] honor tonight that's right but notice
[48:03] now Paul goes into another phase of this
[48:06] and he said but we all with open face
[48:09] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[48:13] Lord but we always an open face now our
[48:16] face is not veiled but with an open face
[48:19] we are beholding the glory of the Lord
[48:23] look at this word of the meaning of this
[48:25] word that beholding it
[48:27] as in owners in a glass Paul said and it
[48:31] is to show in a mirror to make to
[48:34] reflect to mirror to look at oneself in
[48:37] a mirror to behold oneself in a mirror I
[48:41] said beholding in a glass the glory of
[48:45] the Lord oh my goodness
[48:46] beholding oneself in a mirror but yet
[48:50] all said beholding the glory of the Lord
[48:54] how we going to behold our self in the
[48:57] mirror when Paul said what we're looking
[48:58] at is the glory of the Lord because it's
[49:03] not you so much it's not me so much
[49:05] it's the reflected glory after the new
[49:08] birth I notice this is an order that
[49:10] where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[49:12] Liberty then God frees us from the
[49:16] tradition although I'm no good I'm sorry
[49:18] I'm rotten I'm no camp no we were that
[49:21] but by the grace of God we are beholding
[49:24] our renewed self in the mirror by which
[49:27] the glory of God shines upon our face
[49:29] now notice he said that we all with open
[49:32] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[49:36] of the Lord now we're looking at
[49:38] ourselves but were accident we're
[49:41] looking at ourselves but we're actually
[49:43] seeing the glory of the Lord now look if
[49:47] you've got something in your heart
[49:49] something in your life that's not right
[49:50] with god and the word brings that to
[49:52] your attention fix that thing it is
[49:54] straightened up and taken care of so
[49:56] when you behold yourself at the Spirit
[49:59] of God in you liberates you from
[50:01] tradition then you behold yourself in
[50:03] the mirror of the word that you're
[50:05] actually going to look beyond your
[50:06] humanity your shortcomings your faults
[50:08] your failures and you're going to see
[50:10] the glory of the Lord why because the
[50:13] Spirit of God has transformed you and
[50:15] changed you if all you're seeing is
[50:18] yourself over and over and over again
[50:20] you need to move up praise your
[50:22] experience needs to be renewed was God
[50:25] now notice he said so we are beholding
[50:27] in the glass now this is not a water
[50:29] glass of course but it was a looking
[50:31] glass which at this time would have been
[50:33] a piece of metal burnished metal as in a
[50:36] glass the glory of the Lord and we are
[50:37] changed into the same image from glory
[50:40] to glory even as by the Spirit of the
[50:45] Lord so that would dwell in us it not
[50:48] only frees us from sin and liberate sus
[50:51] from the things of the world it actually
[50:52] leads us to the power of transformation
[50:56] now even though we're integrate the time
[50:59] as far as darkness in the world but you
[51:01] and I both know that the greatest time
[51:03] for light to shine is in a time of
[51:05] darkness
[51:07] you know we need the light to shine when
[51:09] it's broad daylight do you so in this
[51:12] time of darkness is when the brightest
[51:14] life that's ever been on the earth the
[51:16] bright light and the bride time is
[51:18] really going to shine out now watch this
[51:20] the Weymouth translation says that this
[51:22] way we mirror the glory of the Lord with
[51:26] unveiled faces we looking as in a mirror
[51:29] catch the light and reflect the glory of
[51:33] the Lord now this is a spiritual process
[51:35] of course it is a spiritual nature alone
[51:39] which is capable of being able to catch
[51:42] that light now think of it this way that
[51:44] there are many many pieces of space junk
[51:46] and meteors and all kinds of things as
[51:49] flying around out here near the earth
[51:50] but the moon is the one by which God
[51:53] chose to reflect the special light of
[51:56] the Sun now what we're not Mars why not
[51:58] Neptune why not you do we know from the
[52:00] construction of the planets of course
[52:02] according to how much metallurgical
[52:03] things is in the content of the planet
[52:05] that's how much illumination ability
[52:08] that it has the more iron ore the more
[52:10] certain metals of that and that is the
[52:13] construction by the creative power of
[52:14] God that he put it inside of those and
[52:16] the moon is made just right so she's got
[52:19] enough metallurgical things on the
[52:21] inside that she can be able to hit it
[52:23] now what if the light of the Sun would
[52:25] hit the handkerchief project it would
[52:27] not reflect anything at all it's going
[52:29] to go right there and not bounce back so
[52:31] the moon is so designed by the creative
[52:34] power of God that govern their life
[52:36] would be able to shine upon the moon and
[52:38] it would be able to what bounce it back
[52:40] off of it but what is that
[52:43] you know you've seen pictures of the
[52:44] well as well as I have and then looks
[52:46] like great craters and dust and all that
[52:48] it's not shiny it's not illuminated but
[52:51] it is a boring life but it's made so
[52:53] that when the light of the Sun is able
[52:56] to hit it it bends it and it comes right
[52:58] back what causes it to bear it's a
[53:01] metallurgical makeup that's on the
[53:03] inside of the moon that God gave it
[53:05] those attributes what he made it in the
[53:08] beginning so he made her that way it's
[53:12] the same with you and I what makes us
[53:14] different than the rest of the world
[53:16] what makes us different now than what we
[53:18] were years ago it's the spiritual
[53:20] metallurgical makeup of our soul that
[53:23] catches the Word of God and when the
[53:25] sunlight of God shines upon it it bends
[53:28] and comes right back other people's
[53:30] Europe then they fond of it the life
[53:31] item and many are hanging around it for
[53:33] years and years and they go away but why
[53:35] don't you do it because it's your
[53:37] spiritual metallurgical makeup that God
[53:39] put it in use Oh hallelujah you are held
[53:43] by gravitation by the Spirit of God they
[53:47] cover tonight Brenda there were this up
[53:49] in Lima last week God I've said here
[53:51] before the let me say it again that when
[53:52] you look at the globe of the earth to
[53:54] sell how it hangs out on the universe
[53:56] and you can see why that for many many
[53:58] years ago that's all kazeer for slack
[54:00] because how in the world would people be
[54:02] able to sell to be able to live on if
[54:04] there's any other dimension other than
[54:06] being flat itself but looking at a globe
[54:08] is you and I have done and you say here
[54:10] we are hanging on the side and you look
[54:12] at the equator and you've got people
[54:14] down around the middle of the globe of
[54:15] the earth and according to where they're
[54:17] standing they're actually standing on
[54:19] the side of this bowl like this so we're
[54:22] standing there like this and they get
[54:24] rain and rain clouds come over them and
[54:26] the rain don't go this way the rain goes
[54:29] in this way now you look at the bottom
[54:33] of the earthy Antarctica how is it that
[54:35] that water and that ice and all that
[54:38] ocean don't fall off the bottom I always
[54:40] said that whenever these people go down
[54:41] there do all these expeditions on the
[54:43] bottom of the
[54:45] come on they go on the very bottom of
[54:47] the Gulf how is it that their ships
[54:49] don't fall off how is it that the ocean
[54:51] hangs on the very bottom you try to do
[54:54] that on the baseball when you go home
[54:55] after church you try to take anything
[54:58] you want to see it on the bottom of the
[54:59] baseball or take given the baseball of
[55:01] ass and you watch what the water will do
[55:03] the water will automatically drip off
[55:06] the bottom will it not why because the
[55:08] baseball is not magnetized by
[55:11] gravitation and ordered older so people
[55:13] can be on the bottom of the earth and
[55:15] they're standing upright this is up
[55:18] right down there and there's all them
[55:20] animals are down there roaming around
[55:21] the polar bears and the Penguins and
[55:23] whatever board and the clouds when
[55:25] winter time and all that comes the
[55:26] clouds will come here under the bottom
[55:28] side and drop snow uppers you saying we
[55:34] ain't got a mighty car you think we
[55:37] ain't got a mighty God and you've got
[55:40] problems that's too big for him to take
[55:42] care of
[55:47] hallelujah hallelujah so the moon has
[55:51] this nature if I can say it that way
[55:53] to where she has the capability of
[55:56] catching the Rays of the Sun bending it
[55:59] back and throwing it back toward the
[56:01] earth now it's a similar than with the
[56:02] spiritual nature of those who are truly
[56:05] born again they have the ability to look
[56:08] into the mirror of the word and the Rays
[56:10] actually bend off of the mirror and
[56:13] flashes back into their face so they're
[56:16] capable then of giving forth what they
[56:19] are what they are hearing and what they
[56:22] are living notice is posted but we
[56:24] always open face beholding as in a glass
[56:27] the glory of the Lord are changed out of
[56:31] this word change Metamorpho which is
[56:34] transfigured transformed to change into
[56:38] another form change into another form
[56:42] transform transfigure cause appearance
[56:45] was changed with a responsive and divine
[56:47] brightness on the Mount of
[56:48] Transfiguration and yet Paul says that
[56:50] we are also are change as we look into
[56:55] the glory of the Lord don't you
[56:57] understand why it's so important what
[56:58] you looking good
[57:00] believe it or not we're not the only
[57:02] ones being changed other folks are being
[57:04] changed in this world now what they look
[57:06] at now what they look at come on now
[57:09] marriage traditional marriage is being
[57:12] rotated around the world why because
[57:14] people are looking at two men or two
[57:17] women are now looking at that and
[57:19] raising kids under that they are being
[57:22] changed in their mind that traditional
[57:25] marriage is no longer traditional
[57:26] marriage come on now Church don't get
[57:28] quite of it they are looking at so many
[57:30] things on television and movies and
[57:32] books and so on and it is slowly
[57:35] changing their thinking it is changing
[57:38] there they are conforming to the world
[57:41] but
[57:42] not conforming we are transformed we are
[57:48] not being conformed to this well that we
[57:51] are being transformed amen
[57:55] also may I said can't you see what Satan
[57:57] would want you to put your eyes upon a
[57:59] preacher all upon some manner honor he's
[58:02] so great and he's this and he's out of
[58:03] the other that's all you think about
[58:05] that's all your talk about oh he's the
[58:07] greatest gifted man don't do that
[58:08] friends of nobody thank God for the
[58:10] gifts that are among us but there's only
[58:11] one great one among us and that's easy
[58:13] that's right because if we're not
[58:16] careful the more we look at that
[58:17] individual we will begin to conform to
[58:20] them and we'll become what they want
[58:22] what they like what they are
[58:24] we had credit to the servants of God and
[58:25] we thank God for them but we want to be
[58:28] transformed into the image of Jesus
[58:30] Christ not some preacher cause all
[58:32] mental failure now the illusion is you
[58:35] know it's hard for us to understand
[58:36] because if we could pick up a mirror or
[58:38] we welcome to the bathroom we look in
[58:40] our automobile there's a rear-view
[58:41] mirror mirrors on the side it's quite
[58:43] different of what we look at today than
[58:46] what they would have looked at there but
[58:47] it is a mirror that was made out of a
[58:50] piece of brass or a burnished piece of
[58:53] metal now when they would take this
[58:55] metal and they would polish it and
[58:56] polish it and polish it so if you're
[58:59] standing there looking at this piece of
[59:00] metal and light is Slone on this piece
[59:03] of metal that you have in your hand
[59:05] unlike the mirror today which is made
[59:07] with a backing to reduce the amount of
[59:10] glare and the amount that hits you back
[59:12] in the face according to the amount of
[59:15] light that was hitting this piece of
[59:16] metal it's going to come and hit that
[59:18] metal and it's going to bounce right
[59:20] back on you
[59:23] or Gloria the mirror today of course
[59:26] well I'll do that let's just direct
[59:28] light at a certain angle and you're
[59:29] sending at the right angle to be able to
[59:31] receive it but then the light that would
[59:33] have hit that metal because the metal
[59:35] had properties that the glass mirror
[59:37] does not have today in that it would
[59:40] Bend the light and cause the light to
[59:42] come right back out so if you were
[59:44] standing there with a piece of burnished
[59:46] metal in your hand and you were looking
[59:48] in that mirror and the light was super
[59:51] super bright and she was looking on that
[59:53] what happened was people standing around
[59:55] you would people stand around you would
[59:59] see that light hitting the mirror and
[1:00:01] they would see the light being bent and
[1:00:03] they watch that light come right back on
[1:00:05] your face so you are you are becoming
[1:00:09] the very mirrored image of the light
[1:00:12] that was in what that's what the gospel
[1:00:14] is that's what Paul is saying that we
[1:00:17] are changed into the image of the Son of
[1:00:20] God so as we hold a mirror of the word
[1:00:23] and we let him wash us and cleanse us
[1:00:26] I'm sanctified and purify us from the
[1:00:29] things of the world and the unbeliever
[1:00:31] world the more that happens the more
[1:00:32] that light shines upon her face unlike
[1:00:35] moses who had to put a veil upon his
[1:00:38] face god what's the glory to shine out
[1:00:41] of our lives
[1:00:42] God wants every man woman boy girl every
[1:00:45] teenager whatever more to be a life of
[1:00:47] the gospel that people can look at you
[1:00:50] and say that is a Christian all-na now
[1:00:56] imagine it as a person holds this mirror
[1:00:58] in the hair and the light is coming from
[1:01:00] behind them will say like this which
[1:01:02] would be the strength of the light and
[1:01:03] as they're looking inside of this and it
[1:01:05] is so black they can barely see
[1:01:07] themselves but they're looking through
[1:01:09] that to see themselves but they're
[1:01:11] seeing themselves through the bent light
[1:01:13] as it strikes the polished metal now as
[1:01:16] it does that they're peering through and
[1:01:18] they've got to break through two
[1:01:19] dimensions as it was because of wanting
[1:01:22] to see the image of their self it's my
[1:01:24] hair straight or mossad burn straight if
[1:01:26] I get anything on the face so they're
[1:01:27] looking through that but at the same
[1:01:29] time they may not even realize
[1:01:31] how much the bent light is reflected
[1:01:34] back on there but others are sending
[1:01:36] they're looking at them and they're
[1:01:37] thinking my goodness it effect that
[1:01:39] light is so bright on their face Oh
[1:01:41] hallelujah
[1:01:43] I'm sure Fred that none of us will ever
[1:01:46] be able to see the fullness and the
[1:01:49] strength of the glory of God on our
[1:01:50] lives I've other people will why because
[1:01:54] the way the light is built and refracted
[1:01:56] and comes right back upon us we can't
[1:01:58] see we can't see look at what God's done
[1:02:01] in our lives it become so common to us
[1:02:03] and if we're not careful it becomes so
[1:02:05] monotonous and yet other people think
[1:02:07] nah not y'all are so blessed y'all are
[1:02:10] so blessed to be able to go to church
[1:02:11] like that you're so blessed to be able
[1:02:13] to have that word you're so blessed of
[1:02:15] what God's done for you I wish I could
[1:02:17] live right you know just something like
[1:02:18] living right every day and you take it
[1:02:21] for granted say well it's just something
[1:02:22] I do I'm a child of God you realize
[1:02:24] there's millions of people out in this
[1:02:26] world that cannot live right from day to
[1:02:28] day they cannot live right from week to
[1:02:31] week they do not have the power of God
[1:02:33] in their life to help them live right
[1:02:35] I'm talking about preacher standing in
[1:02:37] the pulpit they cannot overcome loss
[1:02:39] they cannot overcome adultery they
[1:02:41] cannot overcome hi and you do it every
[1:02:44] day of your life how do you do it
[1:02:46] because of the reflected light of God as
[1:02:49] we are beholding the glory of the Lord
[1:02:52] Jesus it is changing us from
[1:02:54] justification to sanctification from
[1:02:57] sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:02:59] Holy Ghost and the life change will be
[1:03:01] the body change
[1:03:03] was it coming from not from us it's
[1:03:05] coming from him Palmer so we place
[1:03:15] ourselves within the light of the gospel
[1:03:17] and the reflected light of God actually
[1:03:21] changes our own image Oh how's this
[1:03:25] how's this going onto the day what is
[1:03:28] not what do you know when your sisters
[1:03:31] got man
[1:03:32] you look like a soul of a scarecrow but
[1:03:36] just come out of a cornfield you come
[1:03:38] into your husband like a hair sticking

[1:03:46] curse second you're out there yes ma'am

[1:04:03] thing you think of through and you want
[1:04:05] everything just right is all right why

[1:04:09] tell you something that might have been
[1:04:11] special but it's not they're special as

[1:04:16] wedding night out Christ and the bride
[1:04:18] as we don't get to pick out our clothes
[1:04:20] he does amen we could never provide the
[1:04:24] clothes that we need but he says don't

[1:04:40] transport you to this world of darkness
[1:04:42] I've gotta tell you everything you need
[1:04:45] this is a special night sweetheart and
[1:04:47] it ain't going to be one night it will
[1:04:49] be as long as you need it if you need it

[1:04:58] going to give it to that because I've
[1:05:00] gotta break you home Romans 8:29 for
[1:05:16] whom he did beep he did
[1:05:19] beep to be beeped to the BPD beep beep
[1:05:24] and sounds like a Volkswagen Richard on
[1:05:26] it I'm not scared of the Word of God
[1:05:30] I'll look for him he did for no so I
[1:05:46] said the song hey man for me did
[1:05:52] foreknow he did also home ah he did also
[1:05:56] did predetermine their destiny to be
[1:06:02] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:06:05] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:06:08] brethren who could conformed fashion
[1:06:11] likened to adding the same form as
[1:06:14] another similar or conformed to it
[1:06:17] describes what is the essence in
[1:06:19] character and thus complete or durable
[1:06:22] not merely a form or an outline God
[1:06:27] don't want all of us to look like
[1:06:29] Hoffman's head of Christ
[1:06:33] hobo don't shake you too Babbitt in
[1:06:35] reality if you're born again tonight you
[1:06:37] look more like Christ and Hoffman said
[1:06:39] oh Jesus
[1:06:43] Alleluia is a good to be conformed to
[1:06:46] the image of his son why that it would
[1:06:48] be the first model or the first perfect
[1:06:51] one and more sons would look like that
[1:06:54] what on the outside the long hair the
[1:06:57] long road I'm grabbing on to are long
[1:06:59] robes and sandals I hate sandals
[1:07:00] I'm loving work she's a lot use the toes
[1:07:03] in them I'm God we don't have to go out
[1:07:05] longhand grow a beard no that's sort of
[1:07:07] thing that's not the end it's God water
[1:07:09] but it's the spiritual image so we are
[1:07:12] conformed now this is a spiritual
[1:07:14] confirmation of course - made into the
[1:07:16] image of our Lord Jesus this is why it's
[1:07:19] so great right now friend what is going
[1:07:21] on the world is groping in darkness our
[1:07:23] world has never been in the shape she's
[1:07:24] in you heard it yesterday I'm sure just
[1:07:26] like I did that North Korea again lost
[1:07:29] another listen either people tore all
[1:07:31] the pieces scared to death I scared are
[1:07:33] you now I can't get us ain't no way
[1:07:36] before their missiles ever come across
[1:07:38] we'll be sailing out of here hallelujah
[1:07:41] saying how are you well very well so we
[1:07:45] are conformed to his image of his
[1:07:48] temperance his image of his life the
[1:07:51] image of his ability to forgive the
[1:07:54] image of his ability to love those who
[1:07:56] hated him the image Homer that he bore
[1:08:00] upon the earth as a god man with
[1:08:07] meekness and patience and forgiveness
[1:08:11] come on now it's a whole lot harder to
[1:08:14] be lost out to grow long hair and have a
[1:08:15] beard
[1:08:18] if that's how the hippies has got it on
[1:08:20] us that he might be the firstborn among
[1:08:27] many brethren so he's the first human
[1:08:29] being the after passing through death
[1:08:33] was raised to eternal life to remain in
[1:08:36] eternity Oh separate that only in Old
[1:08:39] Testament these people raised from the
[1:08:41] dead they were but they all died again
[1:08:42] but he raised from the dead and will
[1:08:45] never die again
[1:08:46] he was the first unity here is the first
[1:08:49] human nature that was glorified in the
[1:08:53] glorification of eternal life it had
[1:08:56] never been done before humans were
[1:08:59] raised from the dead has been for a long
[1:09:01] time but never had this happened on the
[1:09:03] earth since Adam fell that God raised a
[1:09:06] human being and glorified Oh hallelujah
[1:09:09] can't you see why he's worthy of our
[1:09:12] praise and honor oh I realize they
[1:09:14] support ignoramuses around this message
[1:09:16] someone tell me not long ago they talk
[1:09:18] to somebody around this message been
[1:09:20] around for years and years and they said
[1:09:21] when they sit in their church and people
[1:09:23] worship Jesus they didn't worship Jesus
[1:09:27] Jesus what where is it to be worshiped
[1:09:33] heathens friends you ought to thank God
[1:09:37] for the truth you come here three times
[1:09:39] a week level set down here you know it's
[1:09:41] put up your guard with a bunch of tribes
[1:09:43] and a bunch of nonsense so then it
[1:09:45] become common to you you imagine people
[1:09:47] around our message saying such tommyrot
[1:09:50] well because a bunch of men who held up
[1:09:53] some image of some man and their instead
[1:09:56] of being like Jesus Christ
[1:09:57] remember the prophet of God never
[1:09:59] brought us such trash
[1:10:01] oh ma Oh says be not conformed to this
[1:10:08] world actually those two key words we'll
[1:10:10] look at here that is world in age the
[1:10:13] Greek worship for ages a honored members
[1:10:17] know that meaning the present age in
[1:10:19] contrasting to the age that is to come
[1:10:22] so we're not conformed to the world but
[1:10:25] we are transformed in other words don't
[1:10:28] let this age conform you to be like them
[1:10:32] because there will be a constant
[1:10:34] pressure oh my to their scheme of
[1:10:37] thinking so don't be conformed to this
[1:10:39] world under the word there is scheme so
[1:10:42] it is their way of thinking so the word
[1:10:44] rendered conformed means to put on the
[1:10:47] form of the fashion or the appearance of
[1:10:49] another all my so it can be anything
[1:10:53] about another person that is contrary
[1:10:55] that is devoted the Spirit of God it can
[1:10:57] be the way they talk it can be the way
[1:10:59] they Jess it can be the words they say
[1:11:01] the music they listen to you don't have
[1:11:03] to ask even dress like them to be like
[1:11:06] them it's your spirit that's like their
[1:11:08] spirit oh my well praise the Lord you
[1:11:13] parents know as well as I know that
[1:11:14] sometimes you can tell who your kids
[1:11:17] have been playing with even if you
[1:11:18] haven't seen them because the things
[1:11:20] they're saying the way they're acting
[1:11:22] well I'm going to preach all going
[1:11:24] appreciate me Oh hallelujah we want to
[1:11:28] be like Christ friends Zachary
[1:11:31] look if you need an image that we all do
[1:11:33] we need somebody's image mirror well if
[1:11:35] you did pick out a good old ago still
[1:11:37] safe notice this the Jerusalem Bible
[1:11:39] says it this way do not model yourselves
[1:11:42] on the behavior of the world around you
[1:11:45] the Living Bible says don't copy the
[1:11:47] behavior and customs of this world the
[1:11:50] paraphrase of JB Phillips States don't
[1:11:53] let the world around you squeeze you
[1:11:56] into its own nose don't let the world
[1:12:00] around you
[1:12:01] squeeze you and to its own mold so the
[1:12:05] idea of these verses is basically during
[1:12:07] the same talk that the world around us
[1:12:09] is going to try to make us conform to
[1:12:12] what they think we ought to be now if
[1:12:14] they think this is right and this is
[1:12:16] right and this is right then they want
[1:12:17] us to make you do not want to leave you
[1:12:19] alone and so well we believe what we
[1:12:21] believe in you believe what you believe
[1:12:22] they're not going to leave you that way
[1:12:24] they want to change you to get you to
[1:12:26] believe what they believe then you go to
[1:12:28] hell with them well already I didn't
[1:12:33] come from hell and I ain't going back to
[1:12:34] hell that's exactly right but I've got
[1:12:37] to believe this word to stay out of hell
[1:12:39] so instead of being fogger conformed to
[1:12:43] the world Christians are transformed or
[1:12:45] changed by the power of God how our
[1:12:48] house is done by looking into the mirror
[1:12:51] of his word now somebody that plays golf
[1:12:54] somebody that hunts somebody that dishes
[1:12:56] some other does this they're the other
[1:12:57] and they have all kinds of magazines
[1:12:59] according to whatever your particular
[1:13:00] alike is and I'm not saying that's wrong
[1:13:03] necessarily all kinds of websites the
[1:13:06] caters the golfers or hunters or this or
[1:13:08] that and that's why they sell new
[1:13:10] equipment all the time because here's
[1:13:12] this super string that Mar just flings
[1:13:14] that are so much nicer and yours a
[1:13:16] fashion bullet in a better scope and
[1:13:18] here's a better iron that can help you
[1:13:20] stand there and knock that ball down
[1:13:22] further and beat oh what's his name and
[1:13:23] they're all my here's a better recipe is
[1:13:26] about better cooking pan it's a miracle
[1:13:28] pan you don't have to wash it no more it
[1:13:31] puts in vitamin A vitamin c vitamin d
[1:13:34] vitamin everything into your cooking
[1:13:36] it'll make you live 20 years longer
[1:13:38] there's something wrong with your mind
[1:13:39] if you believe that but what does he do
[1:13:43] the world you're at they see it a whole
[1:13:46] mama remember brother I'm talking about
[1:13:48] seeing a television program and they put
[1:13:50] this open the thing he saw attacks
[1:13:52] didn't even have to watch the plate just
[1:13:54] dip it down and then pull it out he said
[1:13:56] I thought I'm going to be a hero when I
[1:13:58] go home so he got that step ahead he put
[1:14:01] it down inside the water put it up put
[1:14:03] the put of real
[1:14:05] played on the head eggs and bacon
[1:14:06] whatever more dipped it down and out
[1:14:08] water pull it back out just what the
[1:14:10] eggs and the bacons right on there still
[1:14:12] he said I'll never believe what else I
[1:14:15] see on television now you realize it
[1:14:19] what is it Satan has learned that we
[1:14:21] have this ability to be able to be
[1:14:23] influenced by things that are around us
[1:14:26] and we're influenced by what her parents
[1:14:27] say what her friends say what religious
[1:14:29] say what professors say what teachers
[1:14:32] say well your mentor say and then we
[1:14:34] become that if we're not careful
[1:14:36] building outside may remain the same but
[1:14:39] our spirit becomes changed gradually and
[1:14:41] as it does we're pulling away from the
[1:14:44] word most people know that side
[1:14:45] overnight they don't backside from
[1:14:47] Sunday morning to Wednesday night
[1:14:48] they're in the process of backsliding
[1:14:50] for a long time well I hope you folks
[1:14:52] are appreciably I come to have Church
[1:14:55] I'm not sure if y'all want to go to
[1:14:56] Dairy Queen of what I come to that
[1:14:57] church today so no pattern after this
[1:15:03] age all the times that we live in
[1:15:06] because what it does it becomes between
[1:15:08] you and the reflected image of what's
[1:15:11] that now if another person 6r handout
[1:15:13] and another and puts their hand and
[1:15:15] their idea their idea and every person
[1:15:17] that puts a hand between you and that
[1:15:19] mirror it's gonna not part of them race
[1:15:21] not only part of the race coming to the
[1:15:23] mirror but part of the race bending back
[1:15:25] off the mirror and shining on your face
[1:15:27] so here's this blessing mirror you're
[1:15:29] sending that a hold of it oh my so
[1:15:31] illuminated but then the soul thing
[1:15:33] comes in and then something else comes
[1:15:35] in another person six her hand and their
[1:15:37] idea their opinion and this little sin
[1:15:39] and that little sin and before long you
[1:15:41] can't see yourself nobody else can see
[1:15:44] crush on you you become miserable you
[1:15:46] come to a spot you're contrary your
[1:15:48] whole mind you're not in a good mood
[1:15:51] like a child of God out of thee and you
[1:15:53] wonder what in the world is going on
[1:15:55] where's the mirror on your face brother
[1:15:58] am i good to see you folks still come to
[1:16:00] the house of God with a big smile on
[1:16:01] your face the greatest sailor do you
[1:16:03] come back it's a drudgery Omar are you
[1:16:06] coming in able to receive something from
[1:16:07] the local presence of God why have you
[1:16:09] got this person there but I didn't like
[1:16:11] the songs I sang
[1:16:12] lots of temperatures too hot the sound
[1:16:14] system is way too loud
[1:16:16] the piano was still out that guitarists
[1:16:18] pumping too much for me
[1:16:20] too many symbols too much understand
[1:16:21] what's going on somebody's hands
[1:16:23] somebody's opinion somebody's hands
[1:16:25] somebody's opinion it's less like coming
[1:16:27] over your shoulder which means less
[1:16:29] light on your face and you're going to
[1:16:31] walk out there in the world of darkness
[1:16:33] and you're going to feel such
[1:16:34] despondency and such a low empty feeling
[1:16:37] in your life when you had the privilege
[1:16:39] of drinking from a well of living waters
[1:16:42] and letting the glory of God shine upon
[1:16:44] your face but too many hands got in your
[1:16:47] way Romans chapter 12 verse 2 be not
[1:17:03] conformed to this world but be
[1:17:06] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:17:10] not the renewing of your soul now what
[1:17:16] your soul has changed is changed forever
[1:17:17] it can never go back the other way but
[1:17:21] your mind is constantly on an onslaught
[1:17:24] our mind but the skin needs to be
[1:17:27] renewed daily we need this constant
[1:17:31] renewing in our mind resort notice being
[1:17:37] transformed and the Greek word is a very
[1:17:41] radical change from one nature and life
[1:17:46] to another a very radical change
[1:17:54] well praise God it is the word
[1:17:58] Metamorpho which has given us our word
[1:18:00] metamorphosis what a tadpole is changed
[1:18:04] into a frog or when a grub becomes a
[1:18:10] butterfly we speak of it as
[1:18:13] metamorphosis to Renan tell somebody god
[1:18:18] bless your brother and sister Grubb
[1:18:23] bless you brother Grubb horn for the
[1:18:29] robbed grub for the Larry grub bless you
[1:18:33] sister grubs
[1:18:34] sister tadpoles hey I don't mean that in
[1:18:41] a non uncomplimentary I'm complimenting
[1:18:43] you thanks tonight I see something
[1:18:46] you're just fixing to be changed
[1:18:49] amen now it's radical it's radical it
[1:18:57] means a total change from the inside out
[1:19:06] have you ever seen a tadpole go to
[1:19:08] tadpole transformation school have you
[1:19:13] ever seen a grub worm packing his little
[1:19:15] grub worm bag inching down the road
[1:19:18] going to Happy Valley High and if you
[1:19:21] could shop on the side of the road go to
[1:19:23] there in a world where you're going I'm
[1:19:25] going to be transformed I'm going to
[1:19:28] high school and then I'm going to
[1:19:30] college and I'm going to give me a
[1:19:32] degree and as far as I go on my
[1:19:34] knowledge I'll be transformed no he
[1:19:39] won't he will only be transformed by the
[1:19:42] law of life which is in his nature now
[1:19:45] little grab worm couldn't even spell his
[1:19:47] own name if he had one he couldn't even
[1:19:50] spell growth he don't know how to spell
[1:19:53] he don't know how to write all he knows
[1:19:56] is whenever he was born in his
[1:19:58] ramaa laid him out there and all his
[1:20:00] little brothers and sisters and his mama
[1:20:02] picked out the certain tree and most of
[1:20:05] these butterflies you know they like a
[1:20:07] certain tree most grubs that transform
[1:20:09] that way a certain tree or a certain
[1:20:11] bush you know that many of the
[1:20:13] butterflies out in the milkweed so they
[1:20:15] pick certain areas for the milkweed is
[1:20:17] now this mother butterfly has never had
[1:20:21] a botany class she never excelled in
[1:20:23] biology she never knew anything about
[1:20:26] plant ology or how to fly ology all she
[1:20:30] knows is there's a drive in her and
[1:20:32] she's after flying around through all
[1:20:34] these hundreds and thousands of species
[1:20:36] and she comes right over to a milkweed
[1:20:39] and she goes under the bottom side and
[1:20:41] she deposits her legs
[1:20:43] and when she goes to making all this
[1:20:46] thing and giving birth to another
[1:20:47] generation and when the little guys come
[1:20:50] out of there they have one thing in 9/8
[1:20:54] now some of y'all can relate to but some
[1:20:57] of you just woke up when I said eat
[1:20:59] that's all they do is eat and eat and
[1:21:03] eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and
[1:21:08] also co-wrote a song called in peace a
[1:21:11] nice a nice Annie's that's what you're
[1:21:14] supposed to do as a child of God eat and
[1:21:17] eat and eat and eat until you hate
[1:21:20] yourself and to a transformation
[1:21:25] I am going to try to mimic it to knock
[1:21:35] is there ain't nobody I've ever seen
[1:21:36] preaches that can do that brother Jewell
[1:21:45] oh praise God what is it a radical
[1:21:51] change so they eat and eat and eat and
[1:21:57] eat and he did wonder being 600 times
[1:22:01] better than they were on ever born then
[1:22:10] all of a sudden something begins to move
[1:22:12] on they begin to spin expand this
[1:22:21] self-destructive case and they move into
[1:22:27] it and their body begins to liquefy from
[1:22:33] within their body brother J begins to
[1:22:40] liquefy and do a black gooey something
[1:22:44] and make you sick if you saw it the
[1:22:47] resemblance of kidneys of stomach of
[1:22:50] intestines is totally gone and it starts
[1:22:57] changing itself
[1:23:17] once it reaches the stage of corruption
[1:23:23] something changes now it starts forming
[1:23:32] a new digestive tract starts making
[1:23:37] wings which had never had in its first
[1:23:40] life to go starts making aunt Annie its
[1:23:51] eyes change to where it can have 3d
[1:23:55] vision signs have just caught up on that
[1:23:59] you know you have to wear glasses and
[1:24:01] all that sort of thing to see 3d
[1:24:02] butterflies spend dinner for a long time
[1:24:06] to have a different digestive tract the
[1:24:09] blood pressures differ the hardest
[1:24:11] difference every internal organ every
[1:24:15] entire logic is different and in their
[1:24:20] first light
[1:24:23] [Applause]
[1:24:29] hallelujah whenever Organists form on
[1:24:33] his long slender legs and their antennae
[1:24:35] and they've now reached that thing into
[1:24:37] good they got a bustin out and they come
[1:24:49] out walking around them 3d vision eyes
[1:24:57] the wings still the king fly so they
[1:25:00] have to give them a little wild be
[1:25:03] transformed a little small pump type
[1:25:07] thing on the inside of the body their
[1:25:09] antennae are all rolled up and they go
[1:25:11] to blow and there ain't any out Kapow
[1:25:25] use of that word for you
[1:25:32] these are the Wang's go spread spread
[1:25:42] and you look answer look at how powerful
[1:25:47] it is so beautiful and people travel the
[1:25:52] globe butterfly watchers they go to the
[1:25:58] Andes they go to the Congo they go all
[1:26:01] over the world just watch them that's a
[1:26:05] real Christian better blue peoples got
[1:26:10] their glasses on you could that better
[1:26:14] find evidence of there's no way it could
[1:26:17] not transform itself you could not
[1:26:20] change yourself only by the law of God's
[1:26:22] nature within it it's in its DNA imagine
[1:26:27] the monarch butterfly sometimes second
[1:26:29] and third generation is if I go to
[1:26:30] Mexico they disappear for years both
[1:26:33] scientists ever even knew where they
[1:26:34] were wasn't even until the eighties to
[1:26:35] the found out some peasants down there
[1:26:38] Mexico's in the mountain found out where
[1:26:39] all the millions and millions of
[1:26:41] monarchs fly and they fly rattle of the
[1:26:44] Gulf of Mexico they don't all get
[1:26:47] together on a 747 or a Boeing 737 roll
[1:26:50] and get a little ticket but they fly all
[1:26:53] those miles across the ocean who
[1:26:56] Direction many of them in that
[1:26:58] generation have never even been there
[1:26:59] before they don't know where New Mexico
[1:27:01] is from Old Mexico or anything else all
[1:27:04] they've known as Wisconsin and Missouri
[1:27:06] and Tennessee but all of a sudden Sun
[1:27:08] begins to drive them and they take off
[1:27:10] we're not going I don't know but I'm
[1:27:12] following my leader however I'm not
[1:27:14] talking about a goose I'm not talking
[1:27:16] about an eagle with three-foot wings I'm
[1:27:18] talking about a butterfly about
[1:27:20] why I'm they fly and they fry fine if I
[1:27:24] go to tell me how hard it is to be a
[1:27:26] Christian don't you tell me I can do it
[1:27:28] if I let up any butterfly confront of
[1:27:31] Mexico how the command of God don't tell
[1:27:34] me you can't live a godly life by the
[1:27:37] power of God in your nature I don't
[1:27:40] believe it I'll simply don't believe it
[1:27:43] if you're born again it is an endowment
[1:27:46] God
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:28:01] Careca God watch Jesus then it's the law
[1:28:12] of life in their nature I'm gonna go
[1:28:19] ahead and say some of you think I'm nuts
[1:28:20] anyway you think I've lost my mind
[1:28:21] the prophet of God says the power of God
[1:28:25] that'll raise you up is in you right now
[1:28:28] as a matter of fact he said you'll call
[1:28:31] your own body from the dust of the earth
[1:28:38] [Applause]
[1:28:44] be not conformed to this world but be
[1:28:48] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:28:54] noose Newell's the Greek pronunciation
[1:28:57] of it comprising a light the faculties
[1:29:01] of perceiving and understanding are
[1:29:03] those of feeling judging determining the
[1:29:06] power of considering and judging soberly
[1:29:08] calmly and impartially Omar
[1:29:17] judging the power to judge brother
[1:29:20] sister if we ever needed it
[1:29:23] we need that now the world wants to
[1:29:28] control you by controlling your mind God
[1:29:37] what's the transform your mind not
[1:29:41] control it the world wants to change
[1:29:43] your mind now just change your mind in
[1:29:47] the way you do think so for politics
[1:29:49] social media the wrong people all that
[1:29:52] brings pressure to try to get us to
[1:29:55] conform and change to the world this is
[1:29:59] why folks have left the messages whether
[1:30:01] left the message in the days of all in
[1:30:03] the days of Noah because somebody
[1:30:05] changed there Matt it only got to their
[1:30:07] mind never dropped in their heart
[1:30:08] somebody else come and change your mind
[1:30:10] and when they did then they go this way
[1:30:13] well they wouldn't grow up in the first
[1:30:15] place
[1:30:18] there might have been grub doubt with
[1:30:20] the grubs but there's probably a polecat
[1:30:22] or something else but anyway they was
[1:30:24] not a great because if there's a god
[1:30:25] that had that law with him to change
[1:30:26] them into beautiful butterfly hey man so
[1:30:30] if the world controls your thinking you
[1:30:33] are a conformer if God changes your
[1:30:36] thinking you are a transformer not only
[1:30:40] have you been transformed but you are a
[1:30:41] transformer yourself and we are living
[1:30:44] in a world that is hostile to God and
[1:30:47] his truth I married a couple scriptures
[1:30:50] more closing Romans chapter 8 verse 6
[1:30:53] for to be carnally minded is death but
[1:30:56] to be spiritually minded is life in
[1:30:58] peace because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:30:59] against God it is not subject to the law
[1:31:02] of God neither indeed can be seized and
[1:31:05] suturing among whom also we had a
[1:31:07] conversation in times past in the lusts
[1:31:09] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:31:11] the flesh and of the mind now both of
[1:31:15] them work together of course and were in
[1:31:17] sin and he said we were by nature the
[1:31:19] children of Wrath even as others others
[1:31:22] Ephesians 4:17 this I say therefore
[1:31:24] justifying the Lord that you henceforth
[1:31:27] walk not as other Gentiles walk in the
[1:31:29] vanity of their mind having the
[1:31:32] understanding darkened notice this being
[1:31:35] alienated from the life of God through
[1:31:37] the ignorance that is in them because of
[1:31:40] the blindness of their heart who being
[1:31:43] past feeling have given themselves over
[1:31:46] unto lasciviousness to work all
[1:31:48] uncleanness with greediness what that's
[1:31:53] the world we're dealing with though
[1:31:55] we're dealing with things you don't have
[1:31:57] to be honest you don't have to be people
[1:32:00] of integrity and people of character
[1:32:04] if he says 422 that you put off
[1:32:07] concerning the former conversation the
[1:32:09] old man which is corrupt according to
[1:32:11] the deceitful of and be renewed in the
[1:32:15] spirit of your mind that you put on the
[1:32:19] new man the butterfly a man put on the
[1:32:25] new man which after God is created in
[1:32:29] righteousness and true holiness let's
[1:32:34] stand together praise be to God
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:48] all my friends look at your wedding
[1:32:51] night therefore where you look you're
[1:32:56] assaulted
[1:32:57] you can't drive from here to Walmart
[1:32:59] without seeing billboards either with
[1:33:01] cigarettes or some half dressed woman
[1:33:04] you can't even check out at Walmart but
[1:33:06] having all kinds of magazines to your
[1:33:08] left and to your right that has all
[1:33:09] concentrations nonsense on it if we look
[1:33:13] you can't even go to Lowe's to buy two
[1:33:16] before without hearing rock and roll you
[1:33:20] can't go to Bed Bath & Beyond to my wash
[1:33:22] rag without rock and roll going and you
[1:33:27] know - since our kindness in my
[1:33:28] everywhere you go anymore yes now what
[1:33:31] you're doing getting I'm ready for the
[1:33:32] Tribulation Period everywhere we look
[1:33:39] then you go to your job man less you're
[1:33:41] been able to work with Christians and
[1:33:43] it's constantly there everywhere you are
[1:33:45] and then sometimes coming to the house
[1:33:47] of God it's bad enough in the world but
[1:33:50] when addressing so bad people so carnal
[1:33:53] that you have to deal with some of the
[1:33:54] same stuff in church prays for the
[1:34:00] darling
[1:34:06] what is it trying to change your mind
[1:34:09] change your view look friends in our
[1:34:13] lifetime how many things have changed 10
[1:34:16] years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago
[1:34:19] people would have never thought of doing
[1:34:22] things that they're doing today little
[1:34:24] by little by movies by music by books
[1:34:28] magazines by articles little by little
[1:34:31] that change them they change and then
[1:34:35] they're sinking this honey wrong no more
[1:34:38] is it really I kill Jews read the polls
[1:34:40] read the polls about marry marriage read
[1:34:43] the polls about Christianity read the
[1:34:45] polls about much of this stuff and see
[1:34:46] and our generation brainless watch went
[1:34:48] with it was it gone
[1:34:50] why conforming nods and not in the
[1:34:54] middle of this darkness you are setting
[1:34:58] in your soul with the king and the King
[1:35:02] brought this mirror generates the woman
[1:35:05] that packs the mirror but in this
[1:35:08] situation the King backs it and it turns
[1:35:14] it around to you and he wants the
[1:35:18] personification of his own glory to be
[1:35:21] able to hit that mirror and he wants you
[1:35:22] to look into the mirror at the same time
[1:35:25] that the glory is shining so the mirror
[1:35:29] can be able to bend the light and
[1:35:32] reflect it upon you and then when he
[1:35:35] looks across the mirror he looks at you
[1:35:37] and says my love my dove my undefiled
[1:35:43] you have calamus and cinnamon and you're
[1:35:46] thinking really I don't know I had a lot
[1:35:49] every word that come from the mirror
[1:35:55] don't you see friends he's letting it
[1:35:59] shine right upon your face and what he's
[1:36:02] seeing is himself and a reflected light
[1:36:08] no wonder he can so my choice truth is
[1:36:14] there's anything good seen out of me
[1:36:15] he'll has to have a spell because they
[1:36:17] sure didn't come from me let me just be
[1:36:21] honest and say if there's anything good
[1:36:22] see now to all you all I know most of
[1:36:24] you pretty good and if there's any good
[1:36:26] holy and righteous and eternal value see
[1:36:28] now to most of us it'll have to be Bar
[1:36:30] glory because it sure didn't come from
[1:36:33] us but he ain't lying
[1:36:36] he ain't stretching the truth is not
[1:36:39] saying something we don't see he's
[1:36:41] saying what he sees it's on your face
[1:36:45] your life praise God
[1:36:50] let us be glad and rejoice and make
[1:36:52] merry for the marriage of the lamb is
[1:36:54] come and his wife has made herself ready
[1:36:58] to her was granted that she should be
[1:37:02] clothed in fine linen clean and white
[1:37:07] but linen which came from the flax grown
[1:37:11] on the river now in the land of Egypt
[1:37:14] Basilius it produced such brilliant
[1:37:19] white linen that a pound of linen was
[1:37:23] equal to a pound of gold this is the
[1:37:31] word that John uses when he says the
[1:37:33] bride is clothed in this kind of linen
[1:37:36] so brilliant and so wide praise God
[1:37:43] don't you love him tenacity
[1:37:46] it's about his skin if you let him
[1:37:52] praise God thank you Lord Jesus father
[1:38:00] as we bow our heads in your presence we
[1:38:06] ask you tonight Lord that you would help
[1:38:08] us no doubt I'm speaking father to
[1:38:13] people in different degrees of their
[1:38:14] walk with you visible and invisible as
[1:38:18] well maybe some that need a renewing
[1:38:22] some that need a refreshing something
[1:38:24] that's never even given their heart to
[1:38:26] you
[1:38:27] others Lord that are truly born again
[1:38:30] but they need a renewing in their mind
[1:38:33] not so much that they think about filthy
[1:38:38] dirty things like that all the time but
[1:38:40] it's just the things of life the kids
[1:38:43] the grandkids this that the other their
[1:38:46] mind is just so filled with so many
[1:38:49] natural things they're so caught up with
[1:38:53] the schedule of life that to be here on
[1:38:56] Monday morning your money evening and
[1:38:58] your Monday night and here to use and I

[1:39:04] before they know the week is gone and
[1:39:06] haven't even prayed read their Bible
[1:39:08] Lord Jesus all those our hands and views
[1:39:12] that come in to block the view from the
[1:39:14] mirror then we look at ourselves and we
[1:39:16] think Lord I just I just don't feel
[1:39:19] right Lord I just don't feel like I need
[1:39:22] to feel help us to not Jesus I don't
[1:39:26] think there's a one of us in this
[1:39:27] building that couldn't say that the room
[1:39:30] for us to move up I say that Lord let it
[1:39:33] begin with me Lord Jesus help me up pray
[1:39:37] help each of us father we know that
[1:39:41] there's not only stages of glory from
[1:39:43] loser to Wester to Pentecost but they're
[1:39:45] stages in this message our walk is
[1:39:48] stages of spiritual growth we know Lord
[1:39:52] in this chapter after this one here that
[1:39:54] just after they've got married they
[1:39:56] haven't been married very long at all
[1:39:59] until he has to go seeking her and
[1:40:02] asking her to come back because of a
[1:40:06] complacency and a coldness that struck
[1:40:08] her heart what a perfect reflection of
[1:40:12] the humanity that still left and those
[1:40:14] of us that are truly born again after
[1:40:16] being married to Christ the word the
[1:40:18] human part is still there it'll pull on
[1:40:21] us every day of our life we believe what
[1:40:25] your prophet taught father that you'll
[1:40:27] have a carnal sticking nature as long as
[1:40:29] you live and it's going to bother you I
[1:40:30] realize her son to think they're above
[1:40:32] that but in reality we know better but
[1:40:37] we are grateful that it does bother us
[1:40:39] because before we got saved it didn't
[1:40:42] bother us at all
[1:40:43] may you be able to go down these howls
[1:40:46] across these pews cross this platform
[1:40:50] upstairs Lord in the nurseries in the
[1:40:52] back and the nurseries and the sound
[1:40:54] booths on this main level in the ones
[1:40:56] upstairs the Saints Allen George and
[1:41:00] Newfoundland China Cyprus South Africa
[1:41:05] wherever they are in the different parts
[1:41:07] of the world may the Spirit of God I
[1:41:09] pray there was their hearts Lord Jesus
[1:41:13] we love you so much we want to be able
[1:41:18] to reflect your glory it's not ours
[1:41:21] they want to be able to keep the mirror
[1:41:24] clean keep hands out of the way ideas
[1:41:28] out of the way so the light from your
[1:41:31] great face can shine upon the mirror and
[1:41:33] as we look into that it shines back and
[1:41:36] hits us and the more we look the more
[1:41:39] were changed
[1:41:40] the longer we look and look into that
[1:41:42] image the more would begin to let things
[1:41:45] go but if we're currently looking at
[1:41:47] other people looking at other ministers
[1:41:49] looking at ourselves how great we are
[1:41:51] our value this this this this will never
[1:41:54] change from who we are because the image
[1:41:57] we see we love we look at our flesh and
[1:42:01] we look at that image and we love that
[1:42:03] image we will never want that image to
[1:42:05] change but if we see its shortcomings
[1:42:08] its failures then we will want that
[1:42:10] image to be changed we
[1:42:12] weakly letting this go and that go that
[1:42:16] the glory of God can shine through we
[1:42:20] love you tonight father praise God would
[1:42:26] you just raise your hand to the Lord

[1:43:31] worship normal because you're like a
[1:43:35] little boy up in heaven the Prophet
[1:43:39] destroyed that old Trinitarian doctrine
[1:43:41] now resurfaces again under another name
[1:43:43] to Lord still right from the pits of
[1:43:46] hell that's where it comes from
[1:43:49] Lord Jesus people don't want to worship

[1:44:20] that thing is rampant going through the
[1:44:21] message we know what it is it's
[1:44:23] preachers being anointed with demons
[1:44:25] right out of hell
[1:44:26] trying to get people's minds change and
[1:44:29] conform them prophet toasts said the
[1:44:32] devil told you there's three gods so he
[1:44:34] can make a he'd than that of you if the
[1:44:37] devil told people there's three gods to
[1:44:39] make a heathen telling them these two

[1:45:14] be transformed not another name given

[1:57:52] pray to a Father in Heaven and I didn't
[1:57:56] want to make the son mad so I would pray
[1:57:59] to the Sun and I didn't want to make the
[1:58:02] Holy Ghost mad so I pray to the Holy
[1:58:04] Ghost and then I'd go back through and
[1:58:06] try to keep it all in order and then I'd
[1:58:09] get confused had I talked to the father
[1:58:10] more than I talk to the son but the Holy
[1:58:12] Ghost more than I some of y'all that

[2:03:54] fallen while the woman was caring and he
[2:03:57] become crippled he wasn't able to fight
