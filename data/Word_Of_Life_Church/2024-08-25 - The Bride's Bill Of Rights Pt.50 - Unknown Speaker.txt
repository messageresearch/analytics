and true [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you Lord Jesus how many can say Amen to that amen he is so faithful thank you Lord I wish I could say that about me I wish I could say it about you all too but the truth of it is we've not always been faithful have we we've not always been true true to our god true to his his word sometimes even faithful and true to one another I'm just so glad he's so forgiving when may fall short of his glory you may be here today and you may feel like a total complete failure in whatever you're called to be whether it's a husband or a father or a preacher or a businessman whatever you do but I'm glad that we're serving a God today that is a god of new beginnings and every morning his mercies are renewed thank god let's turn together to Mark chap 15:39 if you would I want to speak to you again today on the right to a Ministry each Christian here today has a call a multi aspect multifaceted call it may change and evolve over the years from when your life is dedicated to the Lord ultimately we want to be able to serve his purpose only those who serve God's purpose have a resurrection to life so people may wonder what is our part in the economy of God is our purpose in the economy of God that important it is you see if we don't serve him well in this life and fulfill that purpose there will be no Resurrection for us none I'm talking about onean to life not un judgment so it's so serious today and so important so let's approach it with that in mind if you would and when the Centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost He said truly this man was the son of God there were also women looking on a far off among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the Le and Joseph and salomi who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered unto him so women were ministering unto the Lord Jesus and we know that they were not as we've said taking the scriptures and telling Jesus to sat down they going to preach him a sermon but they were ministering to him things that he had need of remember Jesus called his disciples and they all quit their jobs Jesus was a carpenter for him many every years he quit put his job so how they going to pay for this work remember there's quite a following around them who bought all the food who paid for the lodging who paid for the trips to be able to go here and there and people saying well I don't never preach I could never do anything you realize whenever you will contribute your tithes and offerings and then I will delegate that and help pay for a brother trip here and a trip there and a trip there and somewhere else and there Souls that are being saved people's lives who are changed do you understand you will stand there that day and the Lord will reward you along with that preacher because youve done your part so every one of us have an important thing to do Philippians chapter 2:5 I love the way Paul was that he he was not the type of preacher that was so caught up in his own Ministry and complimenting his own self and talking about all the great things that God did through him and not acknowledging what God had did through others which were less than him he mentioned so many uh people in the gospels here he's going to speak about apodius yet I suppose it necessary to send unto you apodius my brother and companion in labor and fell a soldier but your messenger now look at the categories that this brother apodius served so to Paul he was a brother and a companion in labor but to others he was a messenger look at the aspects that this brother served now he wasn't a church age messenger he wasn't a prophet wasn't a major or Sage or a prophet but yet he ministered to Paul he was a companion in labor you know sometimes a secondary position like that is so hard for some preachers to ever take it's like they feel like they have to have their own aspect of this and that and the other and yet God had this brother's name mentioned for such a position your messenger he that ministered to my wants and the word there is need or necessity or lack I may like to be remembered today as we pray and me just wants the Lord to open your hearts to the word and to be able to speak to us Lord Jesus we thank you so much for what you mean to us thank you for another day that we can be able to come to the house of God on Sunday morning Lord God we ask that that you'd be mindful of us our needs are many Lord God we pray in the name of Jesus that you'd also be mindful of your nation Israel you see father that uh Hezbollah attacking them and them making a move a preemptive strike upon them and Lord you see the way this is going to go we pray Lord Jesus that you would just help them we know every Jew is not one of yours the same way every Christian is not bride but we pray father you'd watch over them we know it's in the charter of Hezbollah poo Hamas many many of the Arabs of their countries to absolutely annihilate and Destroy Israel they will not be happy so they say until every one of them are dead but they might as well say they're going to cause the Moon Not To Shine Anymore or the sun cuz you have said you will have a seed of Israel and then then how much more father can we look at our position as the Gentile bride and say neither will you forget us you're mindful of us pray that you'd help us today may we be able to look into your word and find our position and give us more faith to be able to act on what we're called to do granted father we pray in the name of Jesus amen God bless you Saints you may be seated what a great thing to be a child of God to be able to find our position in Christ Jesus as I hear the prophet said in things that ought to be 12765 in cavina California oh it means so much nowadays Church to see ourselves positionally placed in Christ Jesus not only naturally but of course spiritually but it's not only spiritually but also naturally and it's amazing how they coincide together I'd like to sometime if the Lord would ever let me do it I've done a study for several years and taken each Church in the New Testament the Church of Ephesus the church at colassi the church at thessalonica the church at leoda all the different churches that are mentioned in the New Testament by which letters have been sent to them it's quite quite a an enlightening thing because you see no matter where they lived and what they were dealing with each church had its good points and each church had its points that they needed to be corrected and that was of course because of the area that they live the spirits they were fighting in that area I may have to preach against things here or I may not have to preach against certain things that say brother Tim PR will have to deal with over and over again I may have to deal with things he may never have to mention or other brothers around the world and it's not you know people compare well brother Donnie's preaching this brother Tim saying that brother so and so is saying that but we have to be mindful that if there are things that are being said it's because there's a need for it like the church at Corinth very carnal Church very carnal yet they absolutely loved spiritual gifts and at the same time their church had more issues and more troubles with spiritual gifts than any other Church in the New Testament but if that go Paul had not written it down led by the spirit of God to write it down and deal with their problems how many examples would we have in the entire New Testament of how gifts ought to be operated so God took the trouble in the Corinthian Church and allowed his servant to take that trouble and be able to lay out the word in order to show not only that church but the future generations of people how they should should be done you understand well the church at Ephesus now they were a spiritual church too and they had gifts Prophet said they did they had gifts and they had manifestations of God but you never find Paul having to write to the church at Ephesus and said now don't get up and talk in tongues if there's no interpreter there you never you never find him writing about that because their problems were not like that you never find Paul ever having to address like it did the Corinthian Church of a man that was actually living with his stepmother and they were coming inside the church living that kind of life in sin and the church was just basically letting it go nothing was being said about it so Paul had to deal with that and yet you look at the church at colossia they were a total different Church very revelated church church of great understanding Church of thes the same way but when you go to look at each one of them they were missing certain parts now if we would take the Word of Life church and we would compare it to say evening light Tabernacle in Minden Louisiana Full Gospel uh Lighthouse church up in Virginia or we would take and compare it to this church in India this one in Africa and that one there and we say oh my well them folks have got some real problem problems y now you're living in the real world every Church you go to has problems and I hate to be the bear of bad news but if you're looking for a perfect one let me just tell you right now you might as well look for a needle and a haystack cuz you ain't going to find one and if you did when you got there you'd ruin the whole thing so just accept it for what it is every church has issues every church has problems every church has great traits of the word of God I'm talk about those that are following the word of the hour now and then every church is going to have issues and problems that need to be dealt with by the word and the church said amen now whenever we look at position then I find it amazing that this great revelated church in Ephesus that had such understanding about election they were so able to perceive about the unity of the bride and the groom in the spiritual as aspect in Ephesians 5 that Paul really didn't have to go into a lot of depth and understanding and explained to them what God had done to the Gentile bride remember the church at Ephesus was mainly Gentiles as the church at coloss also the Church of Corinth and also the Church of thessalonica the Lord never spoke to Paul as far as we know and told him that he had a bunch of people at Ephesus we have no record that the Lord ever told him that in coloss or or thessalonica but the Lord knew the church at Corinth was going to be a Troublesome church so the Lord spoke to Paul early on in the in the early stages of the work at Corinth and he told him this I have much people in this city much people no doubt he fell back on that over and over and over again he must have got so discouraged with that church he felt like he was wasting his time he would preach on Holiness and they would have all types of sin he would preach on love and and and they was more emphasizing on speaking in tongues or shouting or whatever more they thought that was the spiritual aspect and Paul had to go down the Avenue of 1 Corinthians 13 and teach them without love their gifts were absolutely Vain and of no value but think of it if he had not dealt with that would we have ever known what we know about charity show me in any other books of the New Testament where any of the authors pin such great Revelation about what charity the love of God really is so if we look at it in the right way even in our shortcomings and our failures and when Servants of God whether it's a pastor or others are LED of the spirit of God to deal with shortcomings in our assembly and our lives if we look look at it the right way will know that God is Not only using that for us for our families for our lives for our church but more than likely there'll be other people that'll be able to hear it and say you know what I needed that too praise the Lord so God knew exactly how to put these people together and no doubt the people in that day you'd go to to the church at Corinth now remember Corinth was a port city so there's a lot of Greeks and a lot of Phoenicians and a lot of different ones because it was a major port city so it be similar to Los Angeles or something like that so there were ships that was coming from Ty and siden there would have been Ships coming from Europe there would have been ships that would have been coming from all different types of places and they would have had you know it's based upon supply and demand so they would have been having everything imaginable in that City the sex trade was unbelievable the drinking and all the things that was there it was a horrible horrible place but yet God said I've got a lot of people here I'm going to start a church I guess he can start one wherever he wants to can't he and what did he do that church was able to be able to rescue the seed of God but they come with baggage like you and I did when we come to the Lord so they love the Lord they wanted to do something for God and boy somehow they tapped into them gifts and there must have been a bunch of people that went there and they just was able to grab a hold to tongues and interpretation and prophecy and they made the offest mess out of it that ever was and they begin to make the main emphasis of every service speaking in tongues and spiritual this and spiritual that no doubt they would compare thems to the church at Ephesus and the church at Colossians said well I'll tell you one thing they may they understand predestination but they sure ain't as spiritual as we are I'm telling you what we have meetings in our church and we're so caught up in the spirit of God the preacher can't even preach boy I'm telling you we had a time man alive we is doing walls of Jericho and marching around this and jumping and leaping over the tops of the pews and we was doing this and that and other Paul said what did the word of God come out from you and out from you only let any man acknowledge if he thinks himself to be a spiritual that what I say are the words of the Lord now you imagine when he went to correcting the Corinthian people on their gifts and some of the sisters now remember some of these women they were formerly goddesses goddesses they were worshiped in the Greek culture now part of their religion was they would have sex acts in their religion so when they would worship these Idols they would have these things so some of the sisters that were in the Corinthian Church now born again they were former prostitutes and they gave themselves at the house of Diana or the house of some of these other gods and goddesses so then when they get saved you know they've got this thing about them they want to they want to give their all to the Lord now they're ashamed of their backline they're so was shame so they come to the Corinthian Church and boy I mean it's a gungho Pentecostal one my I imagine their music was just loud and Fast and they had tambourines and they had all kinds of little oh boy and it was it was really a drawing card to a lot of them boy some of them former prostitutes come in there for some of them former Idol worshippers and boy they love that worship they love that singing and my my they' set their somebody jump up and start speaking in tongues and then think what in the world I ain't never seen nothing like this in my life and there was something about it that Satan knows exactly how to when he sees the Dynamics of a church being molded and made by the personalities of the type of people that it draws and Satan can see the direction that God is going to move with that church and then he will start setting up his war of how to attack that church now if he can't keep them from being spiritual so-called all he's got to do is just push them over the edge a we bit toward fanaticism now I grant you myself I would rather have a little bit of wildfire than no fire at all come on now you go to preaching against the real emotion of God it don't take but about that much preaching against it and you'll silence the whole church and people think well we don't want no Wildfire around here I understand that a lot of message folks don't want no Wildfire so they put out every Fire coming and going because they don't know what Wildfire is and what true fire is so they just come to church sit there like a bump on a pickle and they sleep halfway through church some of them fix the tractor some of them fix their lawn more some of them's fixing lasagna they're making a chocolate cake and they're going to kabas after church we ought not to be baking no cake when we're in the house of God leave you lawnmower tore up leave you tractor tore up come on somebody we're here to have church today and if the Lord pours out his anointing and we go to acting like a bunch of Corinthians well I say send it on Lord Jesus if the Lord wants us to make more act like at the Ephesian Church whatever I don't know how you feel about it this service ain't mine no way and it ain't yours it don't Belong To You Well I want it to go this way when you become God then you can tell us how the service needs to go but until you do we want to follow the leading of the Holy Ghost amen now when you look at the issues in the New Testament churches that was just a preview of the last 15 years but I've been studying on this subject but when you go to looking at it and them finding their position and wanting to be what God made them to be there's always going to be similarities and you're going to find people that you honor they're your mentors and you want to be them you see that was a danger that me having a a background formerly in Pentecost and the prophet said that we take on one another's spirit so you this person you'll make them your mentor and they're they're really emotional or estatic or maybe they're the astute type and they don't move and they don't worship and they come to the house of God and depending on your makeup you will lean to toward one or the other instead of being what God wants you to be now God may not actually let you be what you want to be more than likely won't he'll more than likely cause you to be something that you're not actually you know preferably that you want to be now that does not mean that God not does not use us in the way that he's made us now this was the Insight that the prophet gave us and we'll get to it hopefully here today but whenever the Ephesian Church the great church of Ephesus now whenever you compare how many verses and chapters is in the book of Ephesians very few they did not get the second book of Ephesians third book of Ephesians as a matter of fact they only got one book and it only had a few chapters now that's quite an outstanding thing about the spirituality of that church same with the church at colassi yet when you look at the book of Corinthians you got First Corinthians many many chapters and verses and then you've got second Corinthians which is written about 5 years later and Paul was able to shorten the amount of chapters because they had finally become more stable the man that was living with his stepmother got straightened out and Paul said that he did not want to whip him you know and some people they look at and say oh my we can't say nothing against this because it might hurt somebody's feelings but you also got to realize if you don't say something about it the devil's looking for an entryway into the church so it takes the spirit of God to lead men of God to know when they've said enough and to keep their mouth shut when they don't need to say anything and the church said so you imagine what a responsibility then down Through the Ages since the New Testament that pastors and ministers have really had to be able to do now I I find this so overwhelming that whenever Paul ter with me if you would Ephesians 5:22 that Paul writing to this great deep revelated church at Ephesus and they understood predestination they understood election no doubt they understood the Redemptive power of the blood of the Lord Jesus just great things because Paul doesn't have to deal with it at all so we can assume by that not not being preached that they had a really good understanding but notice what they lacked Ephesians 5:22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord so you mean a revelated daughter of God that can understand predestination and election and maybe the marriage of the lamb and so many wonderful things but yet she can struggle with her position to her husband now remember what the New Testament done it liberated a lot of the women on under the law and brought the women from a place of basically a piece of property to where she is also filled with the Holy Ghost just like the men are and that God could actually speak in tongues to her and prophesy through her which is unheard of basically in the Old Testament except for prophetesses so it's only a Selected Few that God did that there but it elevated the women in the New Testament to where that they were Daughters of God now if you go to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem you'll still find of course they have a a great curtain I was stood there several years ago and the men will be on the left left hand side facing the Wailing Wall and the women will be on the right hand side they still separate to this day some of the churches in Africa still do the same thing but we know that God brought men and women both into one baptism of the spirit of God and that's why Paul would say that in Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female but that does not change the gender that God would allow women to preach so you think of this great deep church at Ephesus and yet he had to write to them this simple something You' think any daughter of God would know wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord so wives submit now not be a slave not be a slave but submit to your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife well shouldn't any woman with the Holy Ghost know this well apparently there was a need in Ephesus for this to be brought back to their understanding say they' remembered it maybe they forgot it maybe they got away from it we don't know even as Christ is the head of the church now being a prophet he's going to bring it in parabolic form and in symbol form to help the sisters to see and no doubt they did as it has helped us through the ages to be able to see as Christ is subject to his church or rather the church subject to him and there's things that Christ says for us to do that we don't understand it we just flat don't understand it but we don't have to do it when we understand it we do it when he makes it known and then sometimes later he tells us why sometimes he don't but we just do it because he is our head now notice for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body now you imagine the daughters of God now in the city of Ephesus another great City uh many Gentiles and whenever they saw this and it was received to them of course in Greek and it been translated to us in the English says a little bit different the Greek to the transliteration but it's still very close but whenever they got this and the daughters of God s there they thought that is so beautiful that's wonderful so the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body so the daughters of God that were may be having a hard time with the headship of their husband could realize so my husband a true Son of God if I am married to a true Son of God then it's not like that he's is going to be my boss and I and I'm I'm a slave under him but God's actually put him there to help me through life to help me through decisions that I'm going to make in life therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and whatever things that they agree with their husbands in and then all those things and the wives can say Amen oh I'm sorry I'm I'm quoting from the word of life version aren't I oh my so let the wives be to their own husbands say it with me sisters a brother say kind of weak can y'all help me out Brothers say it with me in ain't that amazing how much louder them men were some of your brothers have been wanting to say that for years ain't you now sisters you read these next four words with me husbands even as Christ loved the church now you think men may have a great advantage over the women being that they're the head of the home and the wives are to be subject to them but I want you to listen to this next verse how the husbands are supposed to love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it now listen what kind of a husband then that a man that believes this word ought to be that he ought to love his wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it so how did Christ do what did he do when we was unworthy we were undeserving now why in the world would a deep Church which understood Redemption and mercy and predestination and election why in the world would they need to hear this maybe it was their former life maybe it was coming out from Judaism there was a mixture of Jews there coming out from Judaism and remember by the time the Lord Jesus come on the earth there was two great teachers that had come along uh uh teaching marriage and divorce and all of that and most of the disciples were actually Pharisees so when Jesus began to preach on marriage and divorce and the disciples heard this and Jesus said whosoever putteth away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and then in Mark Mark pins it and said whosoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery and when the disciples heard this they said it's good for a man not to even get married if that's the case you ever wonder why they said that because the upbringing that they had been under Judaism for years and years let me tell you how they were under the SK the schooling of some of these rabbis they taught that if the wife raised her voice to the Mother-in-law or the father-in-law or burnt the bread her husband had a right to put her away and marry another Carol honey ain't you glad that law don't in God's word I was eating Cajun blackened before it was popular some of your brothers don't have to move just just sit there and just nod your head I know you understand but now look when Jesus comes he changes that totally he said that was not what Moses said God gave you that writing of divorce but because of the hardness of your hearts it was never God's will so the disciples said well if that's the way it is a man's better off not to even get married so can you imagine how that their thinking of their wives is going to be changed so you're a Jew and you come to Christian ity and then your wife gets the Holy Ghost just like you right you are supposed to love your wife the way Christ Jesus loves the church are you kidding me when basically their wives were no more than a donkey or a horse or a sheep or a cow so if you got tired of the cow what would you do You' take her to the market and seller her so you get rid of her well the woman had no say as far as property the woman had no say as far as in the home you imagine how that some of those Jewish converts must have just shuddered whenever Paul wrote it in the New Testament that the woman was to guide the house guide yes sir now you see we're Gentiles and we're living under 2,000 years of this but there was Jews there and they must have read this and said what is wrong wrong with this man ain't no woman got in my house I'm the boss here I do this I'm afraid we still got some Jews in the message well Hallelujah you see if a man really loves his wife as Christ loved the church then if he's married to a daughter of God she will not struggle to be able to be submissive to that type of a man because even whenever he will say no honey you know I I don't think we need to do this or do that she knows he's not doing it from a self-centered selfish motive but he's actually looking at the betterment of the home the betterment of the unity of the family of what God wants and that's the way we love the Lord Jesus is it not we've all prayed prayers and the Lord Jesus didn't answer the maybe the way we we thought he should or maybe he didn't answer it in the time frame that we thought he should but if we trust him we believe him and we trust him even when we don't understanding oh there's so many things he's done in my life that I have not understood it and I may never understand it but I trust his headship better than my own reasoning because my reasoning sometimes is lying to me and so is yours but you imagine now that these ISS issues were there in this deep deep church now husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself forth so this is our example brothers that we love our wives as Christ loved the church and we would be willing to give ourselves for our wives oh brother Donnie I would do that I'll tell you one thing if anybody walked in the church this morning with a gun and said I'm going to kill somebody and they're pointing to you and your wife I give my life for yeah that's that's a great heroic trait I'm not talking about you men doing this as Heroes I'm talking about you doing it every day at home that's right when nobody knows anything about it that's when it gets a little bit harder ain't it amen's not required they are appreciated though watch again now in Ephesians chapter 6 verse4 and ye fathers provoke not your children to rest so here was some of these deep fathers in The Message Church of Ephesus man what understanding of election what understanding of the great mercy of God but some of them men still did not know how apparently to be able to correct their children so in doing it they were making them mad and actually the fathers the head of the home home were provoking their children to anger wow and you fathers provoke not your children to WRA bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord you mean to tell me there was some people there that wasn't even doing that right oh my now we all remember the great man Moses what a great prophet of God he was and yet Moses got so caught up that's right in his position that he forgot to circumcise his own son wow so you mean we can worry about the lost and worry about doing Mission work and worry about doing this and that and other for the kingdom of God and forget our own children our own nephews our own nieces our own homes and the church said let's look also at the church of colossia 3:18 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord I love the way he wrote this as it is fit or appropriate so if your husband is not a real word believer and ask you to do things that are contrary to the word you're not subject to that you obey them as it is fit in the lord well my husband's not a Believer and he wants me to wear this and that and the other he wants me to cut my hair he wants me to put makeup that's not fit for a daughter of god notice husbands love your wives and be not bitter wow be not bitter against them now we will not ask for the showing of hands on any of these verses I will be a merciful and faithful pastor this morning no commitments being made believe me the smiles and the frowns are already enough so again what a deep revelated Church th this is the church in chapter one oh my verse 15 we're expresses the great mystery of God in the godhead where the prophet's textt from in chist Myster of God reveal chapter 2 verse 9 when he goes to bringing in all the great deep things of God chapter 3 verse 15 and yet having to be corrected now this is not just a passing something but aren't you glad that God allowed this prophet of God to write such things you know why you won't find these exact words nowhere else in the New Testament it all depends on how we look at correction you know we can take Corrections oh my oh that was so hard that was so difficult but out of Correction God can do so many wonderful things how many wives have come to their place in Christ Jesus by reading these passages of scripture for the last 2,000 years how many husbands had had dealt with bitterness now Paul does not go into the detail of what was causing the men in that day and I find it amazing that he didn't turn it right around and tell the wives not to be bitter against their husbands itn't this strange that in certain cultures and in certain regions even that there will be things that will need to be dealt with but don't need to be dealt with everywhere else husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord father Here We Go Again fathers now brother D what are you talking about I thought you was talking about a Ministry I am I'm talking about your ministry at home you see being a husband is a Ministry being a father is a Ministry being a wife is a Ministry being even a child under the headship of your father you are learning your ministry or you say I can't wait till I get out and get married I'll do this and other well I'll tell you what you could be a whole lot better daddy if you've got a Godly one and you watch how he does he'll be able to spare you so much stuff I've watched preachers ever since I got in church and ever since I got saved especially after I become one and I watch preachers and and watch decisions that they make and watch how they handle scenarios bad ones good ones and different ones and all that and those are in the middle too so you can be able to learn I can learn by reading the word yes I can learn by listening to tapes and I do that but I've also learned it by watching Men especially men in position and Leadership that it might help me in my life and my own position and God knows that so this is why that he wants us to have Godly fathers Godly mothers and that our little children they learn the way other nature does so wonder how all the antelope on the plains of East Africa in the Serengeti where I've stood there a couple of times and look at tens of thousands times thousands of bbba of Impala of dier of all kinds of all these things and yet all those Acres that I've drove across years and years ago and go up in a hot air balloon and fly for several miles over the top of the elephants and the zebra and the giraffe and all that and I never saw one zebra school and I never saw one elephant School school now I saw the villages in the Messiah Mara and I saw the Messiah people there but I never saw one BBU College I never saw one Impala school well wonder how them little Impala learned to be able within a matter of minutes when they are born whenever they go to moving in this transitory time the largest migration on the entire face of the Earth and it's amazing how that these these mothers will give birth in this migration you got to be kidding me so in migration tens of thousands of little babies are being born all over the serengetti Plains and them babies are dropped and in a matter of minutes they've got to be able to run like crazy because the Lions also know it's baby dropping time and so do the Cheetahs so do the wild dogs so do the leopards and them babies are so designed unlike us as babies we can't run we can't walk we can't crawl but God made them in the time of danger so they would be able to get up off of that ground after their mother gives birth to them and take off running some of them 45 to 50 miles an hour and they've been carried in their mother's belly for all those months and the first time they use their legs may be running from a wild dog or a cheetah now what did God do God provided for them and then whenever a zebra baby is born the mother will shield her little baby from all the rest of the zebras now remember there's thousands of them giving birth at one time that mother stripes and her spots are unique to herself they've never found two of them that are identical so that mother will give birth to her little baby zebra and she will keep herself from the rest of the herd and that little baby will set sat there and look at her and the imprint of his mama Stripes will be on him it is a permanent marker he will know the way she her voice is and he will see that imprint he will go out and play with all of his little zebra buddies and they all come back but you know what they're looking for they're looking for mama if a baby zebra can do that what about a seed of God that's lost out there in the world but God puts an imprint on you it's called a predes destinated seed and there ain't enough devils in hell to keep you away from the imprint of your father oh my now think of the children that we we long to be spiritual and we long to be great things but we think well just being a daddy what's that got to do and being a mother what's that got to do and you know being honest in my business and what's that got to do that is part of your ministry watch this the prophet talking about his wife and he said I said Lord she didn't mean what she did that morning now brother Randon was talking about sister mey and she was very disrespectful to brother Brandon you remember the story and it was about correcting their son their youngest son Joseph and she said if you was here you would do this and that and other she raised her voice to brother brandom you know he went on out she slam the door and he said the Lord spoke to him and told him he washing his car told him to to go read the scripture in the book of numbers so he comes back and he tells her that oh Bill Bill he said mey the lord gave me something so he said you should not have said that sometime later she develops this tumor in her body remember friends God says touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm if God would allow this to happen to the prophet's wife I feel sorry for the people in this age that are calling this prophet of God a liar and a deceiver it's going to be rough I'm telling you it's going to be bad now what so she's at this stage and that this tor is getting bigger and bigger now now brother renham found it by accident he was talking to someone and said brother renham how does that work cuz the Lord in the early stage of his ministry gave him a gift and he'd take his hand or take the Pati's hand and put on on his hand and and bumps would start breaking out on the on his body and then it would come to him exactly what was wrong with the individual so he was talking to his sister she said that is so marvelous how does that work I said well sister he's explaining to her and said just works like this and said now look at mey she she ain't got nothing wrong with her and as soon as he took mey's hand and laid on his hand he said you've got a tumor in the over so it got bigger and bigger and I want you to notice now how brother Bram is approaching God on behalf of his wife Lord she didn't mean that Lord not one time as she ever said one word about me going in the meeting stay months and whatever it was not one time as she ever opened her mouth about it she was always sent my clothes to the cleaners and washed my shirts and had everything ready to go in the meeting and then she wonders how she can serve God you women as you serve your husband you serve God of course now remember maybe some of you sisters sent your day and you say but brother Dy my husband is gone the Lord took him well maybe that aspect of your ministry is stopped for some others they might get remarried to another man it'll continue on that way but remember you still have a Ministry don't think because God takes your husband or your wife you don't still have a Ministry you still do it might be ministering to other widows but let me tell you this as a warning one of the worst things you can do when you suffer a tragic loss is pull yourself in to it's only about you and your world is about you God never saves any of us without giving us something to do to help the body now watch you women as you serve your husband you serve God of course and now then when I come in all tired and worn out people coming from everywhere and I have to go out somewhere on a fishing trip or a hunting trip why many women would have blowed up at that what'd she do got my hunting clothes ready for me to go now not just so happens and I'm reading this close to hunting season either I said Lord she didn't mean that and I said she had to be cut open three times on account of Shan now want you to notice how the prophet is intervening you said this is one aspect of a prophet that a lot of these blind Le ofans don't understand you look at the Old Testament and you see that prophets are given a position of intercessory prayer to intercede for kings and for Nations you understand what America did God sent America her own prophet he could have interceded for her but she turned him down oh my so notice he said she had to be cut open three times on account of cyrian and I said Lord I I hate to see her have to go through that again CU they're going to have to do a surgery order and what did God do he kneels down and res by himself he's fixing to drive to spport and said Lord I'm So Lonesome for him they had a little foot stool he said they'd all kneel down and pray oh my and he was afraid he might lose her why lost his first one we all know how that is don't we when Satan will try to bring fear and grip your heart but the mercy of God come and said whatever you say and he said before the doctor ever touches her let it be gone that's right now remember she didn't know this was going on but the prophet is now interceding for his wife and God heard his prayer I believe there are still people that can intercede for us don't you now look how important it was now if iall want you to notice brother Ram never mentions to God how many times sister mey spoke in tongues he never mentions to God how many time she shouted she ran she jumped she D she may have done all that I I I really don't know but whenever he's bringing to God that which would say now Lord she's done this and this and this is why I I don't I I don't don't do this don't allow this to happen to what does he mention washing shirts taking his clothes to the dry cleaners wow but do we look at such things as being spiritual or do we say what you do today mop the floors cleaned out the closets wash dishes I'm just getting ready to do the same thing tomorrow and some of you women might get so bored with the drudgery of life I some of you men get so bored with a treasure do you understand the Lord God called you to be what many women can never be a Godly wife a Godly mother oh you say brother Donnie there's millions of mothers I never said mothers I said Godly mothers Godly wives oh speak to us Jesus notice this in the adoption oh it's glorious to find your position and no one can do anything oh my unless you properly know what you're doing but the purpose of this now remember this is the beginning of the adoption or the chapter four part four of the adoption series the purpose of this is seeing your position in Christ seeing that it's not something that you just stumbled into or something that might have you merited somewhere but it's what God did for you himself amen God did for you himself not that you were so good that you went to a church one night and some poor old brother LED you up to the alar wasn't that it was God before the foundation of the world predestinated you to eternal life this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner but don't do that you can never race corn in ephraim's corner if you're a manasse you got to take your place in Christ positionally take it and now after you live that don't mean you're free from war you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on and let me just remind you today once you get in the land of Canaan you may stop fighting to take it but you'll have to start fighting to keep it how many's ever been healed with something and they find that same thing coming right back on you again maybe you laid aside a besetting sin or something that hadn't bothered you in years and yet it comes back and some of you let's just be honest some of you may have fallen right back into the same thing again and you say well Lord there ain't no hope for me no it means you're in the land and them same Devils that you run off before by the grace of of God don't give up very easy so if you whip pornography at one time in your life said boy glory to God it'll never bother me again don't you think that you have to watch that devil he'll come sneaking right back same way with your healing the prophet said that faith will cast that devil out and kill that gross in your body fear and unbelief will resurrect it can you imagine fear and unbelief having such power that it could resurrect a dead tumor in our bodies no wonder God wants us to have such a positive confession somebody say amen God wants us to never lose our praise if you don't get anything out of what I'm saying today other than this let me say this to you in the middle of your trials in the middle of your test don't never lose your praise don't give up on your adoration and how you feel you may not be able to thank God for having a flat tire for coming to church but thank God you had a spare and if you didn't have a spare thank God you had triaa there's always things to thank God for no matter what we're going through come on somebody and if we're not careful we'll let the devil steal our praise steal our joy and we're so sad and we're so down oh my I believe if there was ever a time that we as the people of God needed a restoration of our joy a restoration of our praise and of our worship is now I'm not talking about with the music going 90 miles an hour I'm talking about you having a praise in your heart for the Living God he has done so much for every one of us we were lost and he found us we were wretched and blind and naked and he saved us and filled us with him Spirit oh I love the way he deals with this and the type Canaan did not represent the great Heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk Joshua said Gad I want you right in your lays your place according to the blueprint your place lays here right here you get in here Gad you stay here Benjamin you go right down there oh then whenever they find their spot they can operate then a housewife can come to the house of God she don't have to feel ashamed and be embarrassed you know you hear Brother Daryl talking about the people he's led to the Lord hear these other brothers talking about they prayed for so and so and this happened oh my I don't know of any Miracles that I've ever done well maybe not but maybe you prayed for brother Daryl and God anointed him to do it God still used you do you understand the Lord don't want any of us to stand before him that day with nothing in our hands but brother Donnie what have I done all I've got my children what do you mean that's all you've got is your children when one of them is worth millions of Worlds and you're thinking I haven't done anything for God yes you have in this Dark Age that we're living when Satan is doing everything in the world to pull our youth to the world and the Darkness of the world how we thank God for the use of our church how I thank God for every one of them that are sent you they could have been home sleeping over a drunk from last night or trying to recover from some high but instead they're sitting here in the house of God and they're worshiping the Lord and they're clapping their hands and it ain't just do to the youth leader it ain't just due to the pastor but it's due to mamas and daddies as [Applause] well oh Lord Jesus you've got to know your position you've got to know your place is that right brother West that's right know your position Christ promised the things that I do shall you do also you believe it with all to your heart again reproach for the word you're born for a purpose and nobody nobody on now y'all hearing me nobody can take your place I can't sing like Harry I can't sing like brother Caleb I can't preach like brother Tim prud is known as the prince of preachers I can't preach Faith Like brother Daryl can I can't preach like Brother David Siler man that got can preach up a storm can he but they Ain neither one of them brothers can take my place I can't take theirs they can't take mine and I do not feel intimidated because I cannot preach like this man that man that man sing like this man that man that man I can only be what God's made me my voice may be grally and rough and I you know whatever more I might get off Pitch every now and then but I ain't singing I'm not I'm not applying for some Opera position I'm making a Joyful Noise to the Lord sometime an octave may be a high off or a little bit lower a little bit of gravel here I'd rather give Jesus my gravel then give it to the devil come on somebody what I've got I'm going to give to the Lord I'm going to give my ears to hear his word I'm going to give my eyes to read and study I'm going to give my hands to cast out death devil and lay hands on the sick Hallelujah I'm going to give my feet to the cause of Jesus Christ because no one in this message can take my place nor [Applause] yours you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place that's right God's word will Triumph it cannot fail that's where every Christian ought to stand and trials will come and every way to you but remember God has a purpose and it will all work right so you see it's not just that we get in trouble if we miss it let me go this direction then we'll close here if we serve his purpose we will raise in the resurrection of Life notice this God's creation reflects God God made everything for a purpose and everything that serves God's purpose when it dies it has a resurrection thank you Lord there is no resurrection of life for pontious pilot no resurrection of life for rameses thei no resurrection of life for SAR rib that come against the children of Israel Nebuchadnezzar nebuch caradan no resurrection of life and yet all some of you will be will be a housewife a farmer but you will have a resurrection of life and you will enter into the City and you will never die and great Kings and monarchs and princes and potentates and Priests your name will never be found in the book who's who but I'm glad my name has been found in God's book of who is who my name is actually in the book of Who's Who mhm didn't do me no good though I've still got it I don't know why they wanted to put it in there for it reckon redneck hillbilly whatever I'm not sure why but they wanted to put my name in there under the who's who some of y'all shocked a you but didn't do no good but Jesus wrote my name on the palm of his hand so he looks over in the condensed version and see who's who so the rich the wealthy the infamous and the famous the important the not so important this is really what matters if a man serves God's purpose there is a resurrection just as sure as anything I'm going to quote this next and it's from the title I am the resurrection it's actually preached in camville Kentucky formerly this was titled Garnet Peaks funeral a young boy that was in an iron Lum a young boy that never got to be married a young boy that never got to do much in life but his life's dream was to be a tobacco Auctioneer but he never hardly got to play he never hardly got to do anything as a mortal much that's what it would seem like for God now listen these words from this boy's funeral service we find out that the resurrection only comes when it serves God's purpose if it doesn't serve God's purpose no matter how beautiful how pretty it looks how much better it might look than some other seed that is gerti it'll never rise it lives this and settles that settles it but if it's gerti it must rise am again so is it my friends we here this afternoon to see what death has done to our brother about 18 19 years old it's got to be gered we might belong to church we might might be fine people we might be a good character in the neighborhood a fine father mother son daughter but unless we are germatize with the spirit of God will'll never rise in the resurrection it's finished yes sir now you imagine when he goes on into this funeral service and he said if Garnet doesn't rise there is no rising of the Sun it would be irrational to say that Garnet will not rise a little boy that lived in an arm lung a little boy that had a poor family a little boy that none of his dreams and motives and objectives was ever able to be fulfilled and yet brother brandham preached this little boy's funeral if you haven't listened to in a while do good listen to it he preached this boy's funeral as as if he was a prince a prince why he caught a perspective of life that we look at so different we look at stocks bonds Investments four years of this degree and six years of that degree and I've got this reputation I'm a CEO I'm a whatever oh you know oh i' I've got this and I've got that I'm I'm fulfilling my dream in life and here laid the wed poor little body of a poor little guy that hardly nobody knew but he served God's purpose CU a prophet said he had been gerti by eternal life that's the reason the sun rises it because it serves God's purpose and we rise when we serve God's purpose I believe that brother Williams now I referring to another man that had passed serve God's purpose in life listen what part of the purpose was a real father I see his Darling Companion Mrs Williams sitting here a real husband that's one of God's purposes a father other one of God's purposes and he was dramatized to God by the Holy Spirit God's main purpose let me close with this if everything serve God's purpose it's got a resurrection but it can only rise up if it serves God's purpose I down the basement yesterday listen listen to a tape the devil come to me like he does to you sometimes hey you understand this and you understand that you understand why God let this happen and that happened and that happened I said ' nope sure don't and he come back and said and you still going to serve him am you're you're still going to live for him you're still going to preach I said yep he said how can you do that I said you wouldn't understand [Applause] praise the Lord oh he don't understand how that you can keep on serving him even whenever the Lord may not answer your prayer he don't understand how you can keep coming to church and you may come service after service and you may be going through a dry spell it seem like you ain't getting nothing you said you going back and said yep sure him said why I said you wouldn't understand it in the first place you wouldn't understand it I'm a Child of God filled with the Holy Ghost I've got something you ain't never got something you can't never get well come on somebody he's all the time trying to jump on you you need to jump on him sometime and just wear him out I just think the Lord dropped that down in my heart so you know what the devil done he left me alone I said good Riders get out of here and leave me alone you wouldn't understand I just started preaching my little sermon I paused my tape I started preaching those sermon D D devil I put my hand over here I said devil let me just tell you something old boy you don't understand what it's like to serve God you don't understand what it's like to be filled with the Holy Ghost you don't understand I got to feeling pretty good I'm feeling pretty good right now that's what you need to do sisters go ahead and preach to him at your house and just tell them you don't understand what it's like to be a daughter of God who loves the Lord when the Lord did not answer my prayer yet my love for him is greater than anything I know in this world demons he wouldn't understand it world you wouldn't understand nothing about it why because we have been called by God and we are serving God's [Applause] purpose but brother Donnie I've messed up so bad now Moses after taking the situation in his own hand found out he was a total fail run from the presence of pharaoh and from the presence of God and was a stranger for 40 years way back married an Ethiopian girl so she had a lot of temper Moses had a lot of temper and that was his trouble I just imagine things wasn't so peaceful on the back there of the desert at times but God gave it to him now if you think you married a woman that has a little temper don't nobody move don't nobody bat no eyes or nothing now I'm not even looking at y'all don't y'all look at me now if you think you married a woman has a little temper maybe God's trying to tame you down a little so and vice versa so he was a total failure it's amazing what God can do with total failures glory to God so the P was kind of high she proved it when she cut the foreskin from her son and thre it before Moses and said thou are a bloody husband to me I might imagine things wasn't too peaceful at times what was he doing schooling into the boy's n mind or the man's mind what the program of God was let's jump down to paragraph 33 Moses had been a total failure and maybe there's men here this afternoon maybe ministers that's been total fail years maybe you've been as a housewife maybe you've been as a student at school a child to your parents whatever you've been let that be has been Oh Glory to God let that be has been well what was it when you went to church Sunday morning I was a total failure but I left with hope I had been a failure I had been totally messed up I had been really this and that and the other but I walked out them same doors I walked into I walked in with no hope but I walked out hopeful I walked in it seemed like I was an absolute hopeless case I walked in a total failure but I walked out a redeemed total failure Hallelujah Can We Stand Together whatever you have been let that be has been and start from today no matter what it is maybe you've been a failure as a Christian maybe you failed to go on with God if it has been take note to what I'm going to say in a few moments Moses failed down in Egypt when he was born he been delivered to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt why because he did it in himself he took it upon himself to do it and anytime you take things upon yourself and leave God out you're going to be a failure like Moses oh how many wants God to take you today and help you Moses life consisted of 120 years 40 Years of it coming up to be taught 40 years was a total failure 40 years then he serve the Lord so imagine 80 years 80 years of his life that he wasn't serving God with all of his heart but he done more in them last 40 than all the damage that the devil done in the early 80 but brother Donnie is there any hope are you breathing your heart still pumping There's Hope now you can just go ahead and get down and water all the mistakes and all the fairies if you wish to or you can say how much every time I've got left I can see him as he stood there that day between them two gigantic columns in this Auditorium that was shaped like a mushroom his heart was broken he was blinded cuz he' been a failure his name was Samson he loved one of the daughters of the valley of Sak loved Delilah the very Nation God had called him to deliver his people from and finally conquered him they chained him and he's going around and around and around in circles in the Gris Mill of Satan you imagine him as they go down there and they take them hot poers and they burn his eyeballs out he can no longer see and he's working in the place of a mule an animal but his hair starts growing out tears coming out of those sockets that used to contain eyes now they want to use him for entertainment how many former Christians are now entertainment at a drunken party the prophet said I can see him as he can tell that little boy that's leading him you imagine they got this little b old guy as an act of humiliation they don't bring out this bronny guy leading Samson but a little bitty old fella and he leads him up and he ask him would you put my hands how's this building made so he says there's two columns right in the middle would you put my right hand on one and my left hand on the other and then he prays this prayer Lord once more avenge me of my eyes Lord I'm so sorry I failed you fallen short of the glory of God and the spirit of God comes on Samson and he begins to feel as the Holy Ghost goes to moveing through his body again and he begins to push and all the popping and the cracking and the Bible tells us that he slayed more at his deaths and he did through his entire life a man that was a failure it one like that he was a drunk and then he got saved and had all these great victories he was a leader for God and fell flat on his face he was a failure to God and God's people but God was not going to let his life be crowned with such may God allow you to put your hands on whatever it is that's ending your life and the strength of the Holy Ghost if it's a habit of besetting sin you're past let it be what the prophet called it a has been a has been and forgetting those things which are behind us let us press toward the mark of the High Calling of God which is in Christ Jesus let's bow our heads together hallelujah how many would like to be remembered here today maybe some of you just need strength for your journey some of you need a restoration of your joy maybe some of you finding yourself down in that old grind and Mill of the Philistines you're just going around in circles living with the memories of what you used to be it must have been absolutely tormenting on that man's mind day in and day out remembering how the anointing fell remembering previous victories maybe there's some here today maybe someone streaming this service from New Zealand Australia France Germany Europe wherever you are around the world you find yourself reminiscing of the way you used to be and the way you are today and there's no comparison cuz you've slipped so far oh god father I pray today in the name of Jesus May the presence of God sweep across this place this morning may you deal with every heart Lord we don't want our victories just to be in the past we don't want just to be faint memories I used to be dedicated to God I used to be consecrated to God I used to pray and reading my Bible but God blessed me so much and I got so much in my business and boy I just I ain't got time for it no more I don't want them blessings God I personally would rather have less of this world's goods and have a walk with you than I would what the world identifies as blessings from God no time to pray no time to read my Bible no time with my wife no time with my family no Lord help us Jesus when it's all said and done is it going to be all the money that we make that we stand before you that day and the books are open and say wowy you done great man I'll tell you what you've done so much help us all to realize we're not going to be rewarded for how much we kept but rather for what we gave away but somehow for a lot of business people they think that's theirs they think it's theirs and they don't even acknowledge that you were the one who gave them that ability everybody is not business-minded they can't make money they can't do this that they just don't have it they don't know how to do it I'm one of them I don't know how have no desire to never have but Lord help me help the business People Help the mothers help the fathers if we ever accomplish anything in this life it'll be by what you gave us the talents and the abilities

calls a to the deep and I'm so glad this morning that we're gathered here with people we don't desire the fame and the riches of the world I don't care I don't care if this mayor knows my name I don't care if the governor of Tennessee knows my name I don't care if the president he knows my name amen and the god that created the heavens and earth has placed a desire in you to serve him Amen to be a minister oh I haven't enjoyed this so much on the ministry we talking back today in the study and I told brother Donnie I said you know one day I believe we'll stand there and we'll find out that some of these sisters pray and some of these things that that was done that we don't even know about will be greater than some of the ministers who stood behind the pull pit I believe that friends amen you never know the prayer of a mother how it changes a boy's heart somewhere God put that on her that's an ability for a mother to pray for a child and there's always something that we can do like the little boy you know that was Out on the Ocean we're I know you're going to go but he just he Out on the Ocean and these these starfish had beached theel and thousands of starfish was on the beach and the boys picking them up and throwing them back in the water and this fell said hey little buddy what are you doing he said I'm I'm helping these starfish I'm I'm I'm I'm making a difference and he picked it up you know and he he said Son look at this there's thousands of them up on this beach you can never make a difference he picked up one and threw it in the water and he said I made a difference to that one amen sir if I can't reach the world just let me reach that one for your name will be associated with them throughout eternity and you know as I said before God don't need something big he just needs something yielded to give oursel away Lord use me whatever capacity Lord you want to use me and I give myself to you have you enjoyed the word of God Amen so grateful for brother dar go and enjoy your day enjoy your family and meditate upon the things that you've heard and if you if he comes up on your heart pray for my little buddy my grandson Aiden he they named him Aiden which means little fire and he's certainly living up to that to that name he had surgery on Wednesday uh they did some surgery on his tongue and his upper lip and put I think 10 stitches and he fell this morning when they was getting ready for church and busted his chin and so allly just told me that they glued that back together so if you think about it just say a little prayer for him and pray for these other needs and and I tell you something that's and I noticed in the last few weeks I I get several texts on my phone people some sometimes you don't even know who they are but they say brother Dar would you pray but in the last week or so I've got three or four different text from families saying please pray for my son or my daughter that there's a spirit of suicide on them and they're I just pray that God will spare them and so if you want to pray for something let's pray for our young people for it seems like Satan's really attacking them right now trying to pull them out of this message or trying to tell them they're worthless and they need to take their own life but we ain't going to let the devil have our children I said we ain't going to let the devil have our children amen so if you got you need something to pray about pray for that need right there that God will just move up on these young people and they have a real experience because you see if you're just in the message Satan can talk you out of it but if the message is in you all hell can't get it out of you and that's what we want today do you love him let's just bow our heads heavenly father I I'm just so grateful today Lord that we can gather here and Lord and set under a Ministry like brother Donnie Lord and and father I I'm not just bragging on brother Donnie but the gift that you placed into his life to minister to your people we're so thankful for that father and Lord I pray that you just strengthen our brother Lord and as he said sometimes this is the easy part to stand here it's the it's the counseling Lord and the studying and those aspects of the ministry Lord that some people never see that that weighs the heaviest but Lord I pray that you'd guide him Lord that ever interview that ever ever need that he would have to witness or speak to someone may you just give him the words to say Lord and renew his strength father we pray and God be with us today as we travel Lord and what we have planned for this afternoon may you be a part of that Lord and father we pray for our families and for our children and our grandchildren oh that your spirit would just move upon each of them dear God that they would have their own experience and come to the knowledge and the grace and the saving power of the almighty God and Lord we're just so grateful for the things that we've heard today and Lord I it's it's not important whether we would have the greatest Ministry in the world or maybe the least Ministry in the world all that matters Lord is that we are faithful to the ministry that you've given us and Lord may we only look at that father and just be what you want us to be we thank you for the service today the songs everything that was done For Your Glory go with your people now Lord give them traveling grace watch over us until we come back on Wednesday night we pray and father as a song says may we draw closer to you may we draw nearer to you Lord as we
