[39:05] type of cancer and so it was in the
[39:08] right lower lobe and they was planning
[39:09] on doing a right lower lobe resection uh
[39:13] yesterday so they did several different
[39:15] tests in the lungs and the the bone and
[39:18] the and the uh colon and the esophagus
[39:21] and all those things were clear which
[39:22] was very good and so uh they wanted to
[39:25] go ahead and do a pet scan before they
[39:27] did the surgery on Tuesday so Monday
[39:30] they did a a pet scan and when they did
[39:32] the pet scans showed several more
[39:35] satellite lesions that the MRI didn't
[39:37] show that was in the liver and because
[39:40] of that uh they said she wasn't a
[39:42] candidate at this time if I understand
[39:44] it right for that for that surgery and
[39:46] so it actually showed up some around the
[39:49] lymph nodes also and so they had if I
[39:52] understand this right I I hope I'm
[39:54] telling it right but they had diagnosed
[39:55] her as a stage four met medesthetic
[39:59] saroma and so they're going to want to
[40:02] send her a few days on down to
[40:04] vanderbild and let them look at her down
[40:06] there for a second opinion and make sure
[40:08] what they're looking at and they're

[41:42] his chariots and with the horsemen into
[41:44] the sea and the Lord brought again the
[41:47] Waters of the sea upon them but the
[41:49] children of Israel went on dry land in
[41:51] the midst of the sea and Mariam and the
[41:54] prophetes the sisters of Aaron took a
[41:56] Timber in her hand and all the women
[41:58] went after her with the Timbers and with
[42:01] dance and Mary answered them sing ye to
[42:04] the Lord for he hath triumphed
[42:07] gloriously the horse and his rider hath
[42:10] he thrown into the sea so Moses brought
[42:14] Israel from the Red Sea and they went
[42:16] out into the Wilderness of shur and they
[42:18] went three days in the wilderness and
[42:20] they found no water and when they came
[42:24] to morah they could not drink of the
[42:26] Waters of morah for they were bitter
[42:29] therefore the name of it was called
[42:32] Morra and the people murmured against
[42:35] Moses saying what shall we
[42:38] drink and he cried unto the Lord and the
[42:41] Lord showed him a tree which when he had
[42:43] cast into the waters the waters were
[42:46] made
[42:47] sweet amen there he made for them a
[42:51] statue and an ordinance and there he
[42:54] proved them
[42:57] and said if thou will diligently hearken
[43:00] to the voice of the Lord thy God and
[43:03] will do that which is right in his sight
[43:05] and will give ear to his Commandments
[43:07] and keep all his statues not just the

[50:44] Soldiers the greatest weapons the best
[50:47] horses the best chariots and what
[50:49] happened to them but God by his mighty
[50:52] hand drowned them in the red see he
[50:56] proved that every god of the Egyptians
[50:58] was a dead
[51:01] God and that he was the true deliverer
[51:05] of his people and when Mariam saw her
[51:08] enemy was dead she just folded her arms
[51:11] and nodded her head and well that's

[1:00:53] them I'm so glad glad that I can say I'm
[1:00:55] one of them and they begin to run
[1:00:57] towards the water and maybe the kids
[1:00:59] were breaking rank headed towards the
[1:01:00] water and the Animals begin to smell it
[1:01:03] and they broke Rank and begin heading
[1:01:04] towards the
[1:01:06] water and the one that gets there first
[1:01:08] he runs up he gets down he takes the
[1:01:19] water get back get back
[1:01:25] get the kids
[1:01:26] back it's
[1:01:29] bitter it's
[1:01:33] bitter we can't drink
[1:01:38] it think about
[1:01:41] it think about it three days with no
[1:01:47] water they would have drank
[1:01:50] anything just a few hours with no water
[1:01:53] I was willing to to drink from a canteen
[1:01:55] of someone I never saw in My
[1:01:58] Life Dire situations will make you do
[1:02:02] things you never thought you would do in
[1:02:04] this situation they would have drank
[1:02:06] anything but God made this water so
[1:02:10] bitter that they could not drink
[1:02:14] it and let me say sometimes God will
[1:02:17] make a trial so hard he'll make the
[1:02:20] water so bitter that you can't accept
[1:02:24] nothing nothing less than a
[1:02:28] miracle that he will make the trial so
[1:02:31] hard so difficult the water so bitter
[1:02:36] that there would be nowhere else to look
[1:02:38] yes sir but
[1:02:44] him I'm talking about a desolate land
[1:02:48] I'm talking about desert
[1:02:51] places think about it the disappoint of
[1:02:55] finding
[1:02:56] water only to
[1:02:59] realize it's
[1:03:04] bitter that would only make the
[1:03:07] situation worse it would almost been
[1:03:10] better to find no water at
[1:03:12] all then to find water to have your
[1:03:15] hopes lifted
[1:03:17] up and then have them ripped out from
[1:03:19] under you when you realize you cannot
[1:03:23] drink drink the
[1:03:27] water to be so
[1:03:30] thirsty I'm about to kill
[1:03:33] myself to be so
[1:03:35] dry the dust from the desert the
[1:03:39] sweat the
[1:03:41] weariness to find water and it's so
[1:03:47] bitter you can't
[1:03:50] drink to hear your children say mama

[1:06:52] when you lose your job when the
[1:06:54] bitterness comes in your marriage

[1:10:32] cannot he do it
[1:10:35] again I say tonight yes he
[1:10:46] can but all they
[1:10:50] saw was death right right bitter
[1:10:55] undrinkable water in a desert
[1:11:01] place and it caused them to murmur
[1:11:05] against
[1:11:08] Moses just three days before shouting
[1:11:10] the Victory and now they're up in the
[1:11:13] same one oh God think about it the same
[1:11:16] ones that was running the
[1:11:18] aisle was now in moses' face saying what
[1:11:21] are we going to drink
[1:11:24] run what are we doing
[1:11:29] here you see God was leading him to the
[1:11:32] promised land that he said was already
[1:11:35] theirs well if God was bringing him to a
[1:11:37] Promised Land why didn't he bypass this
[1:11:40] land of
[1:11:42] bitterness but he didn't bypass it he
[1:11:44] led them right straight to
[1:11:46] it yeah
[1:11:50] amen the problem was the Israelites
[1:11:53] didn't see a way they didn't see a way
[1:11:56] around this problem but God
[1:12:00] did the test was for the Israelites was
[1:12:03] a question of faith in what they
[1:12:05] couldn't
[1:12:07] see you see if you understand everything
[1:12:10] that's going on that ain't Faith that's
[1:12:12] knowledge but we don't serve God by
[1:12:14] knowledge we serve him by faith we look
[1:12:18] to the Unseen and many times he asks us
[1:12:20] to walk a path that he doesn't reveal to
[1:12:23] us but you've got to remember he is
[1:12:25] still in control he has never lost
[1:12:32] control never never ever has he ever
[1:12:38] lost
[1:12:41] control they didn't see
[1:12:46] that the test for the Israelites was a
[1:12:48] question of faith in what they couldn't
[1:12:52] see but but you see without the bitter
[1:12:55] water there would been no opportunity
[1:12:59] for God to perform a miracle that day
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:05] amen he is the God of Wonders but if
[1:13:08] there was no bit water that would have
[1:13:10] been no
[1:13:11] wonder
[1:13:14] right oh
[1:13:16] God are you seeing the
[1:13:19] picture without the bit of water been
[1:13:21] been no opportunity for God to before
[1:13:23] per a miracle the most difficult
[1:13:25] situations in our life are
[1:13:28] opportunities for God to do miraculous
[1:13:31] things and to turn our bitter situations
[1:13:35] sweet the desert places in our life the
[1:13:39] bitter lands in our life it's just an
[1:13:41] opportunity for God to show you just how
[1:13:45] great he
[1:13:52] is
[1:13:54] you see when Jessica was blind and God
[1:13:57] opened her eyes I told her God would
[1:13:58] provide a lamb for her eyes and he did
[1:14:00] he opened her eyes and someone bought
[1:14:02] Jessica a lamb because they heard what
[1:14:05] the Lord did for her and they wanted her
[1:14:06] to have a little lamb well the lamb was
[1:14:09] free but the electric fence to put him
[1:14:12] in was about 200
[1:14:16] bucks so I put it up and I turned it on
[1:14:20] and I was sitting there after I put oh
[1:14:21] my God I was Sting right I put put that
[1:14:25] fence up and turned it on drinking water
[1:14:27] sweating a little bit and I thought I
[1:14:30] wonder if it's
[1:14:31] on so I took the water poured it on the
[1:14:34] fence I'm here to tell you don't do
[1:14:39] that do
[1:14:41] not if you don't hear anything I get if
[1:14:44] you don't get anything out of this
[1:14:45] message you get that do not pour water
[1:14:47] on an electric fence when you're sitting
[1:14:49] on the
[1:14:52] ground so I told Jessica I said now K
[1:14:54] she's just a little old thing four year
[1:14:56] old five something like that I said' now
[1:14:58] K listen to Daddy if you want to touch
[1:15:00] that fence you tell Daddy I'll turn it
[1:15:02] off and you can go through the fence and
[1:15:04] pet the lamp I said but if you touch it
[1:15:06] while that red light is on it'll shock

[1:15:36] into that fence so I thought you know
[1:15:38] maybe she needs some daddy's loving so I
[1:15:40] I left the tractor you know crawled
[1:15:41] through the bar went down there where
[1:15:42] she's at little old thing big old blue
[1:15:44] eyes had her hand like this she's

[1:15:50] it's
[1:15:51] hot you said she before it was me

[1:18:38] victory is through
[1:18:41] prayer you see the greatest weapon that
[1:18:43] you hold in your hand tonight is the
[1:18:46] weapon of
[1:18:48] prayer the prophet of God said that
[1:18:51] prayer was more powerful
[1:18:53] than an atomic
[1:18:57] bomb man nor demons can stand in the
[1:19:02] presence of prayer matter of fact the
[1:19:04] prophet of God said when the weakest
[1:19:07] Christian gets on their needs to pray
[1:19:10] all hell
[1:19:14] trembles that means the privates the
[1:19:16] corporals the lieutenants the captains
[1:19:18] all come on somebody all demons tremble
[1:19:22] oh hell
[1:19:26] trembles and the most wonderful thing
[1:19:28] about it is as soon as you have a prayer
[1:19:31] God has the
[1:19:33] remedy thank you Lord hallelujah notice
[1:19:36] in 15:25 Exodus 15:25 Moses he said and
[1:19:40] Moses Cried unto the Lord yes sir and
[1:19:43] the Lord showed him a
[1:19:45] tree which when he cast into the water
[1:19:49] the waters were made sweet wow there he
[1:19:53] made them a statue and an ordinance and
[1:19:55] there he proved them as soon as Moses
[1:20:00] Cried unto
[1:20:02] God God showed him a tree
[1:20:11] wow but you know the most wonderful
[1:20:13] thing when I was studying this at 1:30
[1:20:16] this morning and I was looking at this
[1:20:18] and he just come to me the most
[1:20:19] wonderful thing about this is the answer
[1:20:22] answer to the bitterness think about
[1:20:24] this the answer to the bitter water was
[1:20:28] always
[1:20:35] there it was always there brother D it
[1:20:39] didn't have to show up they didn't have
[1:20:40] to bring it in on an Amazon
[1:20:42] truck it was always
[1:20:46] there God the tree had been growing
[1:20:49] there for
[1:20:51] years years before before they ever knew
[1:20:54] they needed the tree God do have the
[1:20:56] tree
[1:20:59] provided oh God that don't make the pope
[1:21:05] shout the answer to their fear the
[1:21:08] answer to your sickness the answer to
[1:21:10] your problems was
[1:21:13] here it was here before you ever had a
[1:21:18] problem that's
[1:21:21] true
[1:21:24] amen hallelujah is that not
[1:21:28] true how many thousands of years ago was
[1:21:32] this written I am the Lord that Health
[1:21:36] thee by his stripes you were healed
[1:21:42] bastans here not long ago I was in a
[1:21:46] restaurant and the waitress come by and
[1:21:48] say would there be anything else I said
[1:21:49] no ma'am just just a
[1:21:51] check and she said 'well somebody saw
[1:21:54] you in here said they paid for your
[1:21:57] meal and I said ' really she said yes
[1:22:01] and I said well let me at least leave a
[1:22:03] leave leave a tip she said no they took
[1:22:06] care of the tip too so if there's not
[1:22:09] anything
[1:22:11] else you can
[1:22:14] go that's about the way I look
[1:22:20] just but you see I could have done one
[1:22:23] or two things I could have said ma'am I
[1:22:26] don't see nobody in this restaurant that
[1:22:28] I know are you sure you've got the right
[1:22:32] T are you sure it's talking about
[1:22:36] me you see that's one of the biggest
[1:22:38] problems because there's not a person in
[1:22:40] this building that will will say that
[1:22:43] God's Not A Healer everybody in this
[1:22:44] building will admit God Is A Healer is
[1:22:46] that not true but where the problem is
[1:22:49] is when it comes down but will he heal
[1:22:51] me it always always comes down to you
[1:22:53] yeah God's A Healer but the doctor said
[1:22:56] it's the
[1:23:01] worst so I could said ma'am are are you
[1:23:04] are you sure you're talking about
[1:23:06] me I'm a nobody I don't even know
[1:23:09] anybody in this

[1:23:20] something let let me try to do something
[1:23:22] let let me pay for it you know just just
[1:23:24] in case

[1:23:33] stole a
[1:23:35] steak no if you're done get
[1:23:39] up and leave

[1:23:45] paid
[1:23:47] for and the prophet said that day at
[1:23:49] Calvary that Not only was salvation p
[1:23:52] paid for but so was your healing your
[1:23:55] healing has already been paid for you

[1:25:29] really know you can't anchor there
[1:25:31] because it could be it could not be it

[1:33:21] Water water in a bitter land David said
[1:33:25] in Psalms
[1:33:27] 1387 though I walk in the midst of
[1:33:31] trouble thou Wilt revive me yes though I
[1:33:36] walk in the midst of trouble thy will
[1:33:41] revive me Thou shalt stretch forth thine
[1:33:44] hand against the wrath of mine enemies
[1:33:47] and thy right hand shall save me
[1:33:53] in the midst of my troubles when I walk
[1:33:56] in the midst of my troubles he will
[1:33:59] revive me that word revive it means to
[1:34:02] have life to remain alive to sustain
[1:34:06] life to live Prosper to live forever to
[1:34:10] be quickened to be alive to be restored
[1:34:13] of Health to have life to continue in

[1:34:35] restore
[1:34:40] me Lord
[1:34:43] notice David didn't say if I walk in the
[1:34:46] midst of trouble but he said though I
[1:34:49] walk because I promise you friends as
[1:34:51] long as we're here we will have bitter
[1:34:54] lands
[1:34:56] amen amen but ever bitter land is only

[1:35:02] bitter water and turn it sweet to show
[1:35:05] you just how great he
[1:35:10] is you see David understands that they
[1:35:13] will be trouble he acknowledges that
[1:35:16] there will be troubles but he said in
[1:35:19] the midst of those troubles he will will
[1:35:22] not could be not maybe but he will
[1:35:25] revive me in the time of my
[1:35:30] troubles in the land of bitter Waters he

[1:36:34] W yes
[1:36:36] sir the prophet said I think a lot of
[1:36:38] times today the reason we get in tight
[1:36:40] places is God wants to reveal and to
[1:36:43] show us his
[1:36:45] love I think sometimes the reason we get
[1:36:47] into tight places is God wants to reveal
[1:36:50] and to to show us his love and to prove
[1:36:53] to us that he's the same God yesterday
[1:36:56] today and forever and his power is still
[1:37:00] the same certainly he said he wants to
[1:37:04] show his power God likes to manifest his
[1:37:08] power the prophet said maybe that's why
[1:37:11] you got
[1:37:13] sick maybe that's why you got sick that
