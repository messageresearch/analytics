hand clap of Praise brother Matt God bless you buddy praise the Lord we kind of took a lock into this guy right here haven't we brother Matt God bless you buddy so good to see you we kind of like your dad too praise the Lord bless you buddy amen I'm just so privileged to be here with you what a place the Lord has given you it's my first chance getting to see this me and my family weren't able to make the meetings that you had the dedication but you know when God told Abraham he would bless him he said he would bless all the nations of the earth and I believe when when God blesses the bride the whole bride is blessed so I want to tell you you're an encouragement amen this church is an encouragement we stream you we love your amen love the preaching for many years the singing the music my goodness and what a facility it's the place the Lord has given you brother Michael gave us the grand tour last night and I think you thought of everything but Louie I mean you thought of everything I was there one of my favorite Parts was that he showed me the Deacon's office and it was designed so perfectly that right beside the Deacon's office is the Infirmary huh many are the afflictions of the righteous the Bible says amen so we were just uh we're disprivileged Amen to be here and bring greetings from my dad and at home I was so blessed amen got to take part last night my brother Josh did such an outstanding job how many young people were blessed by the word that was spoken last night why don't we give the Lord Jesus a hand clap of Praise amen for what God's doing Hallelujah amen what he's doing in the lives of our young people amen there's nothing the Bible says No Greater Joy that I have than my children walk in truth you know Sister Hattie was given that opportunity just hearing it the other day on tape I've heard but now I see and brother Brandon said there in that room he was given the testimony about the squirrels and he said you know brother he said I don't know what what it could have been other than Jehovah Jireh and sister Hattie spoke those words that's nothing but the truth isn't it amazing just the agreement just believing and saying Amen to the word of God what that unlocks for a Believer from Heaven prophet of God said when she spoke those words it felt like the room was about to come apart my goodness and you don't think it's important if we say Amen to the word of God Amen and we support the preaching of the word brother Branham said Hattie you ask anything right now and God will give it to you that's thus saith the Lord their sister Edith he said sit in a wheelchair crippled he said we've been praying for her he said she could have asked for her sister imagine that could have asked for anything at that moment there's her mom and dad he said you know sick and she'd had to take care of them and he said she could have asked for a million dollars right there just to help her and to support her but I thought it was so amazing to identify the True Heart of a parent more than anything she said brother Brandon more than anything in this life I want the salvation of my two boys and I thought boy how many could identify with that to say Lord if you could do anything do it for my children I mean I believe God's doing something so special so we just bring you greetings and encouragement amen how many would have a need upon your heart maybe you'd bow your head with me raise your hand they can play something just softly just raise that hand up to the Lord and just say Lord here's my need this morning same God who spoke to Hattie Wright can come and speak to me amen this morning Lord Jesus we approach your throne of Mercy Lord father we've read these needs Lord these great requests Lord of sickness and afflictions and diseases and problems and issues Lord behind each hand this morning I've got mine raised Lord behind each hands a need that's represented Lord but I can hear the word you spoke to Abraham as anything too hard for the Lord Lord nothing's too great for you and these are human issues Lord these are part of this Fallen flesh that we live in part of the curse of sin Lord but there's something inside of us that longs down on the inside for this Mortal to put on immortality for that day when this corruptable will put on incorruption Lord we long for that day Lord but even now we believe that those benefits from that Eternal realm can pass down from that Dimension down into this Dimension I pray God you would just come and visit us Lord in a special way may the word go forth with power Lord and may it change lives Lord may we reach out and take a hold of the promise of God lord as it's minister to us I raise my hand and say Lord this morning with all of these people I raise my hand and say Don't Pass Me By Lord Jesus may you come and speak to your children we ask for all these needs we give you the honor and the glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you ushers if you want to come

Christ amen how many believes you got a right to praise him you got something to praise him about amen don't you just love the Lord this morning amen we're just honored to be here and uh appreciate the invitation to come and you know just appreciate your pastor we certainly have uh we have a great respect and love for your pastor and and just um you know just counted a great honor and then also a great responsibility anytime that you stand before the Bride of Jesus Christ you know it's just a great responsibility and so we certainly want to um be mindful of that this morning and I just pray that the Lord would just uh bind us to his word and amen I pray it hide me behind the cross and amen and and we want to have a true Mount Transfiguration experience here this morning amen you know what that would be that Jesus Christ Alone will be glorified Among Us amen he's the only Supreme one amen the only one amen I see my dear friend brother Jackie Ben amen I won't tell you I love that man right there with all my heart and uh when uh years ago I just a young preacher and brother Jackie took me under his wing and took me into a lot of churches and introduced me to a lot of brothers and I've traveled overseas with him over in the country of Guyana been with him several times over there and and I want to tell you this brother goes in places that most people won't go or he's been to places you know and I've watched brother Jackie there's only one problem I had traveling brother Jackie I went with him um first trip and and you know we pre I preached a few times and he come up with this idea he said now brother Josh this is what we're going to do he said you're going to preach and I'm going to sing and then from then on everywhere we get everywhere we went he wanted me to preach and uh but I tell you what I found out right quick those people in in those foreign countries they love brother Jackie I mean you talk about a big name preacher he's a big name preacher amen and he's known all over this world and and I tell you I certainly appreciate our brother this morning maybe we could just bow our hearts together and look to the Lord in the word of prayer and if you've got a need just lift it up to the Lord this morning Lord Jesus we just want to thank you God for this another opportunity that you've given us to come together Lord and we've gathered together here today these are special times that you've given us Lord and Lord when we can come together each one of us a Believer and Lord knowing that we all have a lick of fire off that great Pillar of Fire and Lord when we come together like this Lord your Prophet said the pillar of fire is back in our midst again and Lord we believe that to be true and Lord I pray that this morning Lord as we're gathered here in the faith of your people begins to unite together Lord I pray that Lord the every need would be met Lord I pray that you had healed the sick and Lord that you would encourage discouraged hearts and strengthen that which has been weakened Lord I believe that the word has the power in it and Lord when that word begins to go forth Lord I I don't have a lot of confidence in myself but Lord I got supreme confidence in your word and Lord I know that your word can never fail it can never pass away Lord because you said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never fail and Lord I believe that this morning that word cannot return unto you void but it has to accomplish the thing that you sent it to do so God I pray Lord that the word would strike the mark this morning Lord that it would just drop down into a believing heart and Lord when we leave here today we will leave with a testimony and we would begin to say did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke with us along the way Lord grant it this morning as we commit this service into your hands we give ourselves to you now for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen God bless you if you take your Bibles this morning I want to invite you to turn with me to the book of Galatians in the first chapter of Galatians I want to read a few verses there and then I also want to read from the book of Jude just one verse of scripture also in the book of Jude but we'll start in Galatians 1 and I'd like to read from the first verse Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead and all the Brethren which are with me into the church of galatia Grace be to you and peace from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father to whom be glory forever and ever amen I Marvel that yeast are so soon removed from him that called you unto the grace or into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse and as we have said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that which you have received let him be a curse the book of Jude we'll just read one verse there the third verse the Bible says beloved when I gave all diligence to right unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints amen may God add His blessings as you're seated this morning I'd like to just speak for a few minutes this morning on contending for the faith and you know I believe that as the Bible says here that Jude is encouraging us to earnestly contend for the faith and you know the faith that he's talking about he said he identifies that Faith as the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints now I just believe this morning there really ain't but one Faith amen how many believes that's the truth because they're in Ephesians 4 Paul begins to say that there's one body and one Spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of us all who is above all and through all and in you all and so really there's only one Faith this morning and that's the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ now amen he would tell us to earnestly contend for the faith now brother Brandon would would preach uh and use this for a text and the message earnestly contending for the faith he said now let's just stop here a few moments and he said earnestly contending for the faith now what is it to contend to contend is to debate or stand there and hold fast on your conviction amen for what earnestly contend for the faith not a faith but the faith amen now somebody says well now brother Branham that's not my faith I don't believe in that he said but see there's only one Faith One Faith one Lord one baptism and that's the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ see only one Faith now we got a lot of religions and we got a lot of Ceremonies and amen but there's only one faith that we should earnestly contend for and that's the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen can we say Amen to that this morning listen there's all kind of ideas and there's all kind of doctrines there's all kind of religions in the world today but there's really only one faith and and there's only one gospel amen as Paul would say here in Galatians as he's amen speaking to that church he says amen I I Marvel at how soon you have been removed from the gospel to another gospel and he said which there is not another amen listen friends there ain't no other gospel amen there's only one gospel and I just want to start by saying this amen it is a devil that comes along and tries to separate this message even from the Bible amen that ain't nothing but a lying devil amen because the message that we believe is not something separate from the from the scripture amen the message that you believe is the same message that Paul believed it's the same message that Peter believed amen listen friends amen William Branham did not come to preach to us another gospel amen amen this is not another gospel amen this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ do you believe that's the truth amen there ain't but one gospel and Paul amen said amen and even if an angel come from heaven and we preach any other gospel than that which we have preached amen then you let him be a curse now amen and looking at this this morning amen amen to earnestly contend it means to be be sincere and intense with a conviction amen that you got to as seriously amen approach this thing you got to be sincere in your heart now amen I just want to say this if you've got to contend for the faith amen it's showing you right there already amen that this is going to be a battle amen you're gonna have to fight you're gonna have to amen you're gonna have to take a stand listen friends amen we don't need a bunch of jellyfish amen uh Christians amen with a wishbone instead of a backbone what we need is some real Born Again Holy Ghost Field Believers amen that are willing to take a stand amen I tell you what and I just tell you what the prophet of God said he said any man that's ever amounted to anything amen had to stand on his own convictions amen and he had to stand alone he had to stand amen listen when there's nobody else to stand amen you got to stand if you're only one in your family even that believes the word of God you've got to stand there on your conviction amen and earnestly contend for the faith is that right listen friend sometimes will walk with God Amen it's a lonely walk amen and to walk with God you've got to walk alone amen but I I like what the Bible says over there in John 16. amen Jesus is telling his disciples he's he's getting them ready for his departure amen and he's telling them he said listen you're going to be scattered and you're going to leave me and I'll be left alone he said but yet not alone for the father will be with me and I want to tell you this and just encourage you amen sometimes you feel like you're all by yourself amen sometimes you get a feeling like Elijah had one day amen when he stood against Jezebel that Jezebel religion and he stood out there and he thought I'm the only one left in all of Israel amen I'm the only one amen they've torn down the altars amen they they are rejected amen amen the god the Jehovah God and I'm left alone amen but God Amen opened up the seals the prophet said amen and he showed him amen no I got seven thousand Hallelujah that's never bowed and amen and he showed that prophet of God you ain't by yourself amen and let me just say this amen you ain't by yourself either hallelujah amen and the biggest saying amen now we got to realize is that if God before us then who can be against us Hallelujah Amen to earnestly to sincerely intensely amen with a conviction I tell you friends we got to have a conviction and stand on our conviction the prophet said amen the first one to introduce the message of our faith would be our lord Jesus he said Jesus was a product of what God intended for us to contend for amen the whole Christian faith laid in Jesus Christ our faith in him now if we can only understand what kind of Faith he taught what kind of Faith he practiced and then we could see by that amen if the early church practiced the same thing then we should earnestly contend for that type of Faith see for his commission for us to continue in that Faith amen now so it's very powerful to think about this amen the prophet is showing us that the faith that we are contending for amen Jesus is the faith of Jesus Christ and he showed us by example amen amen and I just say what kind of faith that he had even he had perfect faith amen he had Faith amen the prophet said he walked in a world to himself amen he walked unconscious of criticisms amen because he had faith and listen I think it's amazing amen what the prophet of God showed us he said what gave Jesus such great faith amen listen for his it was not some Supernatural amen a feeling that he had that gave him the faith amen but what gave him the faith according to the prophet as he is that he identified himself in the scripture he saw himself in the word amen and when he saw himself in the word it give him the faith amen oh listen friends I'll tell you something else about the faith that was in him even because the faith that was in Jesus was the faith of God Amen and the faith that was that God had it's God spoke the word and brother Brown said he believed his own word then his word became material oh Hallelujah I'm telling you this morning friends that's the kind of faith that ought to be in the Church of the Living God he said brother what are you saying I'm saying we ought to speak God's word and we ought to believe God's word and then watch amen the word of God when it comes out of your mouth become material because the word of God has never failed in the mouth of God's believing children do you believe that [Applause] amen Jesus told his disciples one day have faith in God you know but the prophet comes on and says listen he said he begins to show us the translation it should be have the faith of God listen amen amen and then we find out amen Paul says and later on he says he says the life that I now live I live by the faith by the faith amen of the Son of God listen rizz and and brother Brown picks it up in the church age book there brother Matt and he shows it was not his faith in God Amen that that he was living by that was giving him overcoming power it was the faith of God in him Hallelujah listens a lot of people say they believe in God there's a lot of people amen that that perhaps amen have a belief amen but I tell you what amen there's a group of people on the Earth this morning amen that not only has faith in God but they have the faith of God in them hallelujah amen and the light that we now live we live by the faith of the Son of God that's in US listen that's why you're an overcomer it's not because amen of you as an individual I just want to say this is a you ain't no match for the devil within yourself amen you are no match for him amen but if you got this Revelation and you've been born again filled with the Holy Ghost amen then you uh amen you can say this is what greater it's he that is in me than he that's in the world you know why you're an overcomer amen because the Overcomer is in you and Jesus said I have overcome them Hallelujah he's already overcome and now the Overcomer is in you it's his faith in you oh my how many he's thankful for the faith amen now Galatians 2 20 he said I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live not I but Christ that lives in me is that right amen so listen the faith that we're contending for it's not a Baptist faith no disrespect to them it's not a Methodist Faith it's not a Pentecostal Faith it's not a amen Church of God faith it's the faith Hallelujah the faith of Jesus Christ the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now in the church age book amen the prophet says we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the first or original church was founded and how that God manifested himself in her the word can't change or be changed because the word is God Hallelujah John 1 and 1 in the beginning what's the word is that right Amen in the beginning was the word I just want to amen stop right here and say something Amen in the beginning was the word the word was the beginning listen because before the word came out of God nothing had started amen the first thing that happened in all creation Amen brother bam would show us the picture he said to logos amen the word amen come out of God Amen and and the Bible says that the worlds were framed by the word of God Amen so the word was the beginning let me just say this it's still the beginning amen if something's going to start it's got to start with the word if there's going to be a Revival and it's going to be a real Revival it's going to have to start with the word if somebody's going to get healed it's going to have to start with the word it's somebody's going to be saved it's going to start with the word if your life is ever going to be changed it's going to start with the word oh hallelujah amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God listen that's why you can't come along and say well I love Jesus but you but you don't love his word that's a Jesus of your imagination amen amen there's a lot of people that fell in love with amen they fell in love with Jesus amen but they fell in love with the story amen they fell in love amen with something that they imagined to be amen are not a reality because I tell you this amen you cannot separate God from his word and if you love God you'll love his word and if you love the word you love him let me go a little bit further with that and just tell you to receive the word is to receive Jesus Christ to reject the word is to reject Jesus Christ how many believe that's the truth listen you're living in a layout of cnh when Christ had been put out of the church but I want to tell you ain't nobody none of them churches out there amen Jesus wasn't standing in there with nail scarred hands and they said now wait a minute buddy welcome here and let him out the door no how did they put him out they put him out by putting his word out they rejected the word and therefore they rejected Christ listen I'll just say this without apology this morning amen because there's a lot of people even just looked at this message amen struck their shoulders and walked away amen and they thought they were walking away from an idea they thought they were walking away amen from William Bradham they thought they were walking away amen from just a a church or amen but listen amen when they looked at this Amen to listen and they walked away they were walking away from Jesus Christ Hallelujah I know the devil don't like it but I'm just gonna say it this morning this message is Christ listen I don't know I don't care what they made out of it and I can't help what other people have done with it amen but the message I believe it's not a bunch of doctrines it's not even an idea it's not just a better way to live it's not the thoughts of a Kentucky boy it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah it's a reality of a living God yes sir now watch we can see this as a prophet begins to say here he said he said to change one word of it as Eve did bring sin and death is that the truth as it says in Revelations 22 18 If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book Amen to us try them they say they're Apostles and are not and it's found them to be Liars amen and brother Brown said ain't that a blunt statement now it's tried them that cause and call themselves Apostles isn't that a blunt statement what right as a people to try those that call themselves Apostles and how do they try them well I love this here it is Galatians 1 and 8 but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be a curse it was the Apostle who brought the original word to the people and that original word could not change not even a daughter dash of it Paul knew it was God who spoke to him and said even if I come and try to give a second Revelation or try to make one little change in what I've give originally let me be a curse see Paul knew that the first revelation was correct and God can't give a first revelation and then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind if he gave a revelation and then now listen brother Ed said he can give a revelation and then add to it now you got to catch that right there because amen amen how many believes that the message that that we have received is the very thing that Paul preached [Applause] amen because brother Brown when he went beyond the curtain of time amen and and he asked he said amen he said well Paul had to stand with his group he said yes Amen brother Brandon rejoiced in that fact you know why because he said because I preached what Paul preached [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah and y'all probably gonna think I'm crazy but I just tell you if I am Leave Me This Way unlike the prophet I feel good amen being how I am amen but I believe even that I was one of them voices that he heard that screamed out I'm resting on that Hallelujah you say brother what are you talking about you believe he was over there when the prophet I believe I got a theophany Hallelujah I believe I got a word body I believe it's already there if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I have another Eternal in the heavens Hallelujah you say brother amen what are you talking about you believe you got a theophany you better believe it brother and I don't heard from it amen cause my brother said when you recognize this message to be Eagle food you let the other thing you've heard from your theophany Hallelujah listen if I get off on the deep end don't worry brother Donnie you'll straighten it out amen but I tell you what I believe I heard from it then and I believe if you can handle it right now I'm hearing from it right now this morning and I want to tell you the theophany that I got ain't A Million Miles Away I believe it's so close it's right in this room right now I'm feeling the influence of it right now Hallelujah and I'll be one of these mornings and it won't be long I'm going to take a step Hallelujah and I'm just going to step from this Dimension into another dimension Hallelujah and the faith that is in my heart now is what's leading me to that step Hallelujah we're resting on that we're resting on that but watch because he can't give a first revelation then the second revelation oh no no amen but he can give a revelation and then add to it brother Brown takes it back to Abraham he said he called Abraham he told him he'd be the father of many nations amen see that was the first revelation amen but then he began to add to that Revelation and he began to designate amen that seed would come through Sarah amen he began to give a fatherance of the same revelation listen friends I believe that bro that William random preached what Paul preached but Paul said when he began to talk about Melchizedek he said listen there's a lot of things we can say Amen but you become dull of hearing and when you have need to be you should be a teacher yourself you got neither you would be taught you ought to be eating meat but you're unskillful in the word and he said there's a lot of things that I could say about Melchizedek amen but but listen this is not the hour amen so I'm just going to give the Revelation and I'm going to leave the rest to the seventh angel Hallelujah and when he comes amen he'll give a father of the same Revelation and now we have a message who is listen for years not that Melchizedek but who is this Melchizedek who is this that is Among Us who is this amen this that's revealing these things oh I tell you this amen if all you see in this message is a man William Randall I got great respect for the prophet I've got great respect for his ministry you'll never hear this preacher belittling or diminishing amen or tearing down the ministry of thy Prophet but I tell you this if all you see in this in this message is a Ministry of a man you missed the whole point he said I was not the one that was standing down there that appeared that day down there on the river I was only standing near when he come Hallelujah I'm not the one that tells these things as perfect as they are it's not what I knew it's what I Surrender myself to hallelujah amen the angel is not the son of man he's a messenger Sin from the son of man but you are not feeding on the words of a man you're feeding on the body word of the son of man [Music] Hallelujah that's what's changing you ain't no different gospel ain't a different revelation hurry with me this is a continuation and by the way just so we're clear on this it ain't something outside the scripture come on Friends the revelation of the seals is not something outside of the scripture amen even you know the person come to brother brown one day he said with your qualifications you could write a 23rd chapter of Revelations it sounded good amen but listen it was contrary to the word amen because the Bible already said If any man had to or take away amen then the pledge will be added to him and his part be taken out of the book amen listen there is a prophet didn't come Amen to write another Bible he didn't come Amen to give a revelation outside of this Bible what he come to do is tie up all the Loose Ends and reveal the hidden truth that was contained in the scripture we had a Bible even for almost 2 000 Years brother Matt but we didn't know what we was reading but God rich in Mercy in these last days sent a prophet to the land and a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word Hallelujah let me tell you something because you know brother Brown would just say people you know I'm in I'm in some I'm in another man's pulpits I try to be very respectful and and rightfully so and so I I walk with humility and I'm trying to you know I wanna I don't want to overstep any bounds in anything but I believe that I know your pastor's heart but amen how many thankful that you got a pastor that'll stay with the word I think y'all could I think you'd do better than that how many's glad you got a pastor and a state Church of the word Hallelujah listen there's all kind of ideas there's all kind of doctors there's been all kind of isms and schisms amen there's all kind of men out there with all kind of motives and objectives and they're building their own kingdoms and there's eight Messengers and everything else you can think of Amen but I'm glad that God has still got a true five-fold Ministry Hallelujah let me just say this I've done forgot about them notes so I'm preaching amen but I wanted to let you know something if there is a fake there's got to be a real brother bam comes along shows us if there's a bogus there had to be a real first amen if there is a bogus dollar there had to be a real dollar so there's a bogus pastor there's got to be a real one if there's a bogus teacher there's got to be a real one if there's a focus evangelist there's got to be a real one well I'm gonna go ahead and say if there's a false prophet [Applause] hallelujah it's got to be a real one somewhere Hallelujah and by the way just cause they come out with a fake hundred dollar bill you didn't go get in your wallet and throw away every 100 bill you had come on amen you just praying the one you guys real amen amen you didn't let just cause somebody come along with a fake one you didn't amen you didn't throw away all the real ones so why in the world Amen would you let the devil come along say point out every false Apostle and false prophet and false preacher amen and then you throw away all preachers just go listen don't throw the whole basket out cause of one rotten apple God still got men that'll preach the word God still got somebody that'll just say what a prophet said God still got some gospel preachers that'll take the gloves off and just call right right and wrong wrong Hallelujah and you ought to be thankful this morning that you got a pastor that ain't a people pleaser he ain't trying to make you happy he's trying to get you perfected Hallelujah I ain't here to try to preach you happy I'll be getting happy while I'm preaching even but there's some more important for us the ministry of this hour is for the perfecting of the Saints sometimes that word has to come and cut your hide but I tell you what if you're a real believer a Son of God you'll walk out of them doors with your hands lifted up and say thank you for the weapon Lord I needed it real fast [Applause] thank God for the truth listen the Bible said they tried them I forgot my well praise God I was going to say I forgot my phone so I don't know what time it is there's a huge clock back there foreign win the preacher it just it just all depends on who you compare me to [Music] they tried them you know what brother how did they try them by the word what gave them the right Paul and he tried it but listen friends you know what they did they took them every Ministry they heard you know what they did they took it back to the word and you know what they said they said you're a lie if they wasn't preaching what Paul already preached they stood right there and said you're a liar because you ain't saying what Paul said [Applause] listen I want to tell you I'm just going to give you this this morning don't you never try any men don't you judge it by the anointing [Applause] don't you judge it by how well he can speak don't you judge it by amen how he can put things together you take it back to the word and if he ain't saying what Paul said if he ain't saying what William Branham said listen I don't make no apology to say it this morning if they're not saying amen listen there's a lot of things you hear even around this message I can't find it in this Bible there's all kind of ideas come along say oh you don't even need to go to church now I think you'll never find that in this Bible say brother you better back up Listen to listen listen I know where I'm standing this morning you won't find that stuff in this my Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as a manner of some are even the much more as you see that they approach you friends there's either one of two things either they don't believe the days approaching or they've left the word one or the other amen because the Bible says amen is long list of risk as long as you've got an opportunity even you ought to come together amen and worship God and set under our ministry and hear the word of God preached in power there's a reason why the devil's trying to stop it because it'll be by the preaching of that word that lives will be changed the sick will be healed oh my God brother Brown said he said the Keystone of the whole Bible is the Revelation that God never changes and not his his ways are as just as unchangeable as he is Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Ecclesiastes 3 14 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him that which has been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God required that which is past what is that it's showing you the revelation of an unchanging God this is very powerful because if God is in fact unchanging in his nature in his Essence amen how many believes that God never changes his nature never changes amen if that is a is if that is true then every action of God is a prophecy so bro what do you mean by that I mean but I mean this that if God don't change if he did something one time if the same circumstances ever repeat then God will have to do the same thing again [Applause] Hallelujah friends that's powerful and the prophet is going to show you something very powerful out of it because he said if God ever healed a person one time and you meet the same requirements then if God is a just God he'll have to do the same thing for you [Applause] if you did it once listen he'll have to do it again you believe that praise God I guess I spoke too soon about not being long-winded I preach the batteries out but listen you see but you see what I'm saying you you understand if you meet the same requirements if you come with the same attitude amen and God has not changed I love what brother Brown said amen he said God's attitude towards you is revealed in the seven Redemptive names amen amen how many knows amen that he's Jehovah Jireh he's a provider so if you've got a need God's attitude towards you is I'm your provider Hallelujah he's Jehovah Rapha he's a Healer amen so if you're sick this morning God's attitude towards you is he is a Healer [Applause] oh yes sir and God never changes it's the Keystone of the whole Bible listen I'll just tell you this friends men change churches change seasons change Fashions change Everything Changes but God don't never change see the discrepancy brother Brown said now this is Harvest Time he said at the beginning when God sowed his seed into the Earth he gave it into the hearts of his children his family to keep that word that was their only defense to keep the word and here the enemy come in and broke that barrier by sowing a seed of discrepancy contrary to the word of God if that was a discrepancy in the beginning it's still anything that will add anything to the word of God is still a seed of discrepancy I don't care where it comes from I don't care if it's organization military sources political Pirates anything that's contrary to the word of God is a seed of discrepancy when a man stands and says he's a gospel preacher and says at the days of Miracles has passed that's a seed of discrepancy when a man stands and says that he's a minister a pastor of a church somewhere and he does not believe that Jesus Christ is the same in every detail except the physical body the same yesterday today and forever that's a seed a discrepancy when he says the Miracles in Apostolic age as past as a seed a discrepancy when they say there's no such thing as Divine Healing that's a seed a discrepancy when they come along and say that God don't feel with the Holy Ghost no more that's a seed a discrepancy [Applause] [Music] that's what brother man said in the church take a book he said those Scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over don't you believe it such a statement is wrong on two accounts first of all it's wrong to Suppose there ain't any more Apostles just because the original 12 are dead and an apostle means one cent amen and there are many sent ones today but they're called missionaries as long as men are being called and sent forth with a Word of Life the apostolic age is going on secondly they refer to an age of the manifestation of the holy ghost power as being over since the Bible has been completed that is untrue there's not even one scripture that suggests that but many conclusively state otherwise here is the proof that both of these charges are false Acts 2 verse 38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call the promise of power we see Apostles we're in due with it Pentecost is to you the Jews and to your children Jews them that are far off Gentiles Hallelujah you ought to shout the building down on that one brother amen because amen you are not even in the Commonwealth of Israel having no hope no promise amen but God rich in Mercy Hallelujah has broke down the middle wall partition amen and made us all what and now through Jesus Christ you have become the Seed of Abraham with the promise Hallelujah and This Promise is unto you he said that Jesus your children the Jews and them that are far off that's the Gentiles that we that we're far off we're brought nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] that ain't even the end of it he said even as many as the Lord our Gods shall call listen where the prophet of God said amen until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease how many believe that's the truth and let me just stop and say this before I go any further amen when I'm talking about Pentecost I ain't talking about no organization I ain't talking about this denomination out here I ain't even talking about 1906. amen I'm talking about the original [Applause] church that was born on the day of Pentecost hallelujah amen Pentecost is not an organization it's an experience [Applause] Brown said what the church had at Pentecost is an enable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse diverse signs and wonders gifts of the Holy Ghost amen Hebrews 2 amen therefore we ought to give more earnesty to the things which you've heard unless at any time we should let them slip forth the word spoken by Angels was steadfast in every transgression and Disobedience to the word received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great of Salvation which at the first begin to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed on us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and diverse Miracles gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will the original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and let me just say Amen thou was the original church that was the alpha church this is the Omega church amen and the Omega has to match the alpha we are not organized by men church I'm going to tell you this bride is not being led by men amen this bride is being led by the Holy Ghost amen we ain't got no Bishops I'm gonna say it again we ain't got no Bishops there ain't no group of men even though we're following amen I only think I can say as Paul said Paul said come follow me as I follow Christ does God use me and sure he does Amen but the church is not organized by men nor led by men the church has been brought together under the power of the Holy Ghost and is being led by the power of the Holy Ghost [Applause] brother the band said it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God and stay true to the original pattern [Music] listen friends we ain't got but one pattern there's only one there's only one Church that we should pattern ourselves after how many believes in the sovereignty of the of the local church brother Brown believed in the sovereignty of the local church and I believe that that is actually what comes under attack through denominational denominationalism organized religion amen what is it it's stripping away the sovereignty of the local church amen and begins to tell men what to preach and when to preach and how to preach and amen this is going to be you know come on Friends amen and if you're going to be a part of this and we're going to give you any kind of backing and then you're going to have to allow this and and we're going to okay this you don't believe I'm telling the truth go talk to some United methodists right now and you'll find out how true it is come on Friends amen and it's stripping away The Sovereign he's stripping away the sovereignty amen because God intended for his church to be led by the Holy Ghost amen and your pastor ought not have to call nobody up and get permission [Applause] amen if he's going to preach a certain thing on a certain day amen he ain't got to get okay from somebody from some Pope or something amen okay well I guess you're pretty no no no hey man he's got one boss Hallelujah I got one boss brother Matt's got one ball listen for his we got to be Lego you say brother don't you believe that the church is United under one headship I sure do amen but it ain't a group of men hallelujah it's not some man it's Jesus Christ Hallelujah he is our head and the bride will be knotted under his ship [Applause] [Music] and the only pattern we got is the early church and brother Branham said every church will be striving to be like that church Hallelujah I told my church at home I said listen we ain't trying to be like the church down the road no offense to them we love them we appreciate them amen but listen amen churches are different amen and churches are sovereign amen and I'm not trying to match my church with another church and you're not trying to match this church with another church amen but we're all amen we got one pattern amen and that's the church that was born on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah if we're striving to be like something it's got to be that foreign I've always said it's a great matching time he said you you paint your steps red watch your neighbor paint his red he said you watch he said he said some of the women will wear a certain kind of hat at church and watch the rest of them get that same hat Jacqueline Kennedy had her water head haircut I don't even know what that is but amen I guess I but anyhow I mean look at all the women amen she wore them little Old Sac colored aprons and things like that and scandalous for a woman to be out on the street stretched out like that and look at all the women doing the same thing it's an impersonation amen but that's in the world but the church people picked it up and it's a shame that they do it it's wrong for them to do it it's a disgrace and when we see it creeping into Pentecost it's more disgraceful that's right but you see the church puts up with it and lets it go I don't care I've never cared whether my coat match my trousers or my time match my coat I want my experience to match God's Bible and his requirements and that's what we Pentecostal people ought to do is have our experience just like theirs was because he is the same Jesus the Same Holy Ghost the same power and he's living today hallelujah how many of you have that desire this one listen friends I ain't trying to Max much I'm not trying to be amen listen I'm just going to be straight with you and just can I let go and preach for a minute hey man I'm just going to go ahead and tell you I'm not trying to be Donnie Reagan I ain't Donnie Reagan no disrespecting him I appreciate his gift probably no greater one of the greatest preachers ever lived but I can't be him and I ain't trying to be like him for me to try to be like him is an impersonation I trying to be brother Branham Amen Let Me let me just that is not my place not my Ministry I'll just tell you who I am I've read a story one time amen and I so identified with it because I thought this is perfectly me amen because I read this story and there's this little they said it was out in the battle hot battle and they had a flag boy a banner bear you know and and he goes before the Army and he goes and he's lifting up that banner and and he's lived and you know and he's lifting up that flag because he's amen that's reminding them of what they're fighting for of who they're fighting for and what they stand for it's very important you know if that flag's lifted up it gives the soldiers courage amen and he's lifting up that Banner he's lifting up amen and he's going forth and they said brother Matt they said the battle got hot and and the enemy was overtaking them and he said and they said that flag boy had somehow got up ahead of the soldiers and he got out there a little bit too far and and the captain got looking up there and he said hey he said bring that flag back over here not black boy he stood over there and he he got to looking around and he thought hey I fought way too hard to get where I'm at he said no bring up the men that Captain said hey bring that flag back over here he said oh no you bring up the men amen I read that story and I thought hey here I am right there I ain't no big preacher amen I ain't got no big Ministry amen I'm just a little flag boy this morning lifting up the banner of the Cross lifting up the banner of this message Hallelujah but I want to let you know something I don't care what they say I don't care how many cents come back amen Retreat go back they ain't no retreating me brother I come too far I fought too hard to get where I'm at this morning I ain't going back I ain't turning around I said no bring up the men come on little bride we come too far to turn back now we fought too hard to quit right now let me tell you some church this is not the time to stop this is not the time to retreat this is not the time to give us content fight stand Hallelujah all right sorry I got my thing all messed up the prophet said let me just try to come to a close I know my time is gone man you you're a wonderful group to preach to you watch what the what the prophet said here in the churches book he said the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10 7 is going to do two things I'm going to try to close right here but according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers right and he will rip the second thing is he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally right that will literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so listen friends I want you to understand something this morning this message is a message of restoration Hallelujah watch where the Prophet said in the first seal he said I love this other reformers but that great they were great men of God seeing the need of the day they brought a Reformation Revelation 10 said that his message was to reveal not the reform to reveal the secret that reveal the secrets the word see in the man what would it Hebrews 4 so the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the center of the bone a revealer of the secrets of the heart see the man is not a reformer he's a revealer a revealer of what the mysteries of God or the church has got all tied up in everything he has to come forth with the word of God to reveal the thing out because he is here to restore the faith of the children back to the father's Hallelujah the original Bible faith is to be restored by the seventh angel the original Bible faith now it's the holy spirit in the last days to shine forth the evening lights restoring back the faith that was trampled down through the denominations condemned the denominations coming back to the original Faith the original Bible Faith the original Bible believing every word not adding to it making it say this and making it say that just say it the way it said amen and you want to believe it that way how many wants to believe it that way and we're promised that to restore every voice has a message behind it and the message was to restore the faith back to the original faith of Amen Malachi for a restore back the faith of the fathers to the people they've got off in all kinds of everything they'll restore it back again that faith that meant the message of the hour is to return back to the word the prophecy with the restoration of the word will come a restoration of the power listen to me that's why he that's why a prophet told us brother Matt he said 1906 Pentecost restoration of the gifts was not the long-awaited restoration that was prophesied in the Bible in Joel chapter 2. he said it could not be because the former or the teaching Reign had not failed yet the word had not been restored back to the church at that time amen and and that restoration would be a restoration under the word the former latter rain falling in the same month amen do you believe that's the truth listen Prince amen thou were the towns of the reformers down Through the Ages and they brought a reformation and we thank God for that amen and every amen every messenger amen build upon amen the other's achievement amen and moved into a higher realm amen but God did not send us a message of reformation but he sent us a message of restoration Hallelujah he said I will restore saith the Lord all the years amen that was lost all the years and remember amen there were four bugs but a prophet comes along says it was only one bug really in reality in four stages and ties it right back Amen to the horse horses of Revelation 6 and the Antichrist Spirit coming in four stages against the church amen but he said I will restore and what did he say in the restoration of the Bright Tree four messengers of death amen destroy the thing and ate the tree down before messengers of life will bring her back again hallelujah amen and this is the hour a message has come to restore the church back to the original Bible with the original Bible faith Hallelujah and it's the hour of restoration what is restoration taking something back to its original condition [Applause] restored it back to what it ought to be to what it was made to be and listen friends I want you to know something you were created in the image of God man was made to have dominion an amateur God on the earth listen I ain't outside the Bible I'm in the scripture amen I'm in the message of the hour amen you are not me Amen to be dominated you were made to dominate and you got a Dominion listen church can I quote a prophet to you oh that Adam lost you now possess Hallelujah I'm closing stay with me for the five more minutes amen I'm going to show you something amen because we're always kicking it down the road we're always putting it off to another time we're always putting it off to another age amen we're always putting it off someday one day amen one day a Revival is going to strive one day amen the power is going to come one day the Dynamics will fall listen friends we have arrived that day is here the time is now Hallelujah even it's in your possession amen what we need is somebody that'll press through amen don't take no for an answer Hallelujah the prophet of God said how did they make the achievements that they made and the message count down how do they have these great scientific breakthroughs he said because somebody amen got it in their heart amen that it was possible amen they refused to take no for an answer listen you know what they said you know what they said not to late 1800s early 1900s you know what they said flight is not possible for man you can go back you can go back and get newspaper articles and and and read out of a well-known uh you know New York Times and well-known newspapers of that of that time and they were writing articles about it brother Jackie and they said man we'll never fly it's impossible one great man said it like this he said man will never fly that was reserved for the Angels alone but you know what they were some they were some old boys that they didn't really care what they said amen something told them it's possible amen and and and Wilbur right I love he wrote a letter one day he was trying to generate some support and get some financial aid and stuff he wrote a letter to a guy one day and he said sir I'm Afflicted with a belief that it is possible that man will fly he said and I'm afraid that my Affliction will continue to get worse amen and he said and I'm setting my Affairs in order now amen because I'm afraid that it's going to cost me all my money and maybe even my life he said but I am Afflicted with a belief amen that it is possible that man can find he took that for his let me tell you something amen he was afflicted with a belief that is possible for a man to fly I'm Afflicted with a belief this morning amen that the change of my body is a possibility not just a possibility a promise and I don't care how many lying Devils say it cannot happen it'll never happen Hallelujah there's something in me that says it will happen Hallelujah I'm Afflicted with a belief even that the prodigals are coming home my children is going to get the Holy Ghost your children is going to get the Holy Ghost hey but I don't care what they say I don't care what the naysayers say I don't care what they say about this message but I want to tell you I believe it I'm Afflicted with it is a promise and this is a message of restoration and by the way let me close in saying this amen it's restoration with compensation amen because if you go back in the Old Testament if a man stole somebody's ox amen and that guy needed that Oxford plow is filled to plant his crops amen if that man amen got called and what he'd done he couldn't just go back and give that man his Ox back he had to compensate him for the time lost in the field for the crops that he lost amen because he didn't have the heart come on church God put a law in the Bible amen you ain't just going to give back what you what was taken from you amen you're going to get more Hallelujah and under this message of restoration brother let me tell you you ain't just getting back the joy you lost you're going to get all that back and a little more finally and we ain't just God brother we got everything they had on the day of Pentecost plus the opening of Seven Seals plus a feat that'll change our bodies it's restoration with compensation glory of God hallelujah and by the way it's a restoration by enforcement [Applause] Orange God is going to make the devil give it back all right and brother Phantom begins to talk about he said and the Holy Ghost is the enforcer he's the high Sheriff I've ever promised in this Bible and I'll tell you what I'll tell you what let me give you this one example I ain't telling you no more I'm closing but I'm going to give you this for myself amen amen musicians go ahead and come that'll help me amen amen but but if you went home this afternoon and in your house you walk in your house you go inside walk in your living room and there's some old guy sitting on your couch and he done went in there and opened up your refrigerator and he's drinking he's drinking your Dr Pepper and he's eating your ham and he said man oh I mean I'm just asking him I don't know probably everybody's different but some of you might just turn around and walk back I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I do I say man who who are you and who gave you the right to come in here and you know what you might politely ask him to leave it's like look man I don't know what you're doing here but or how you got here this is my house what are you going to do if he don't what if he what are you going to do if he says no I'm staying right here and well then what are you going to do if he's like three times your size I'll tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna pick up my I got a cell phone most of y'all probably know what them are I'm gonna pick up that cell phone I'm
