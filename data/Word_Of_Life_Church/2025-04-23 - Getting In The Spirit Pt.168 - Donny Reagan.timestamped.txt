[5:09] of God midweek? Praise the Lord. Look at
[5:12] your neighbor and tell them you're glad
[5:13] to see him
[5:15] tonight. Mean it from your heart now.
[5:17] Tell him you're glad to see him in the
[5:19] house of the Lord. What a privilege it
[5:21] is to be able to come to the house of
[5:22] God to worship him in spirit. And if
[5:26] you're so glad our pastor and sister
[5:28] Reagan made it back home. We're
[5:30] certainly glad for that. Amen. Praise
[5:33] the
[5:34] Lord. We We know we share you, but we
[5:37] don't like it one bit, but we know
[5:40] that's part of it. So, we're certainly
[5:42] glad to have him home with us tonight
[5:43] and just looking to forward to what God
[5:45] would have for us tonight. Had a great
[5:47] time here on Sunday morning, didn't we?
[5:49] How many of you appreciate the word of
[5:51] the Lord?
[5:52] Amen. Praise God. Now, if we have any
[5:55] visitors tonight, we want to say we
[5:57] welcome you to the house of God. Glad to
[5:59] have you with us. trust you'll just feel
[6:01] at home, make yourself at home here
[6:03] tonight. All of our visitors, God bless
[6:06] you and all of our streamers locally and
[6:08] around the world, we want to say, "God
[6:10] bless all of those folks." Can we give
[6:12] all these people a good hand tonight?
[6:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. We're going to
[6:18] look at our prayer request. Brother
[6:19] Andrew Cobb, I don't who is here with
[6:22] him, if his family is or not. I only saw
[6:24] him, but he's going to be giving us a a
[6:27] song here just in a little bit. So
[6:29] looking forward to that. Uh want to let
[6:33] you know this. Sister Brandy Anon sends
[6:35] this in. Dear church family, Sister Ruth
[6:38] Anon passed away this morning. My dad
[6:41] Charles Anon's mother. And so we want to
[6:44] certainly remember those folks in prayer
[6:47] that the Lord would just be with them
[6:48] during this time in their life. That God
[6:51] would just wrap them up really, really
[6:53] good in his arms and love them. Sister
[6:55] Sarah is requesting prayer for her her
[6:57] husband Abel to come back to the Lord
[7:00] and give him deliverance. Thank you so
[7:02] much. So we want to remember that.
[7:04] Please ha ask the church assembly to
[7:06] pray for Cameron. He's a young man that
[7:08] really needs our prayers at this time.
[7:10] He is sincerely seeking a closer walk
[7:12] with God. There are great needs in his
[7:15] life. He is currently attending a a
[7:17] denominational church. He has mentioned
[7:19] that he would like to know how it all
[7:21] works. So, we just commit that request
[7:23] unto the Lord tonight. We remember
[7:25] Sister Lona in prayer. A lot of pain
[7:27] with her shoulder. Uh she had to leave
[7:30] or she has to have an MRI tomorrow. So,
[7:33] we're asking that the Lord would just be
[7:34] mindful of her. Sister Linda Jublonsky
[7:37] has an urgent unspoken prayer request.
[7:39] We just commit that unto the Lord.
[7:41] Sister Ruth Louise Jax wants to thank
[7:43] everyone for their prayers for her and
[7:45] her family. She is also asking for God
[7:48] to intervene concerning an ongoing issue
[7:51] with having her driver's license
[7:53] reinstated. So, let's remember that
[7:54] prayer request tonight. Please remember
[7:56] brother Don and Sister Patty Cooper in
[7:58] prayer. They both have a virus, unable
[8:01] to be in the service tonight. So, we
[8:02] want to remember them. And if you would
[8:04] tonight, I want you to remember Randy
[8:06] Lewis, a friend of mine over in
[8:08] Elizabeth, and he has prostate cancer.
[8:11] And I told him that I would certainly
[8:12] turn in a prayer request for him
[8:14] tonight. and he said he certainly would
[8:16] appreciate your prayer. So, let's
[8:17] remember Randy Lewis tonight as we pray.
[8:20] Please remember many of the saints in
[8:22] the Congo. I was supposed to be
[8:23] traveling uh to the Congo next week with
[8:26] believers from Maine. We're unable to
[8:28] travel due to ongoing gang wars and
[8:32] violence. Many of the believers and
[8:34] their families are being forced to flee.
[8:36] We're trusting the Lord. Brother Tyler
[8:38] Gagnan sends that in. So, we certainly
[8:40] want to remember that prayer request
[8:42] tonight. Sister Barbara Grabley has a
[8:44] testimony she'd like to share with you.
[8:46] She got the results from her uh echo
[8:49] cardiogram and three of the four
[8:50] arteries in her heart are showing no
[8:52] signs of worsening. She appreciates all
[8:55] of your prayers. So, we want to thank
[8:56] the Lord for that and ask God to just
[8:58] continue to be with her during this
[9:01] time. Sister Abby Potter wants to thank
[9:03] the Lord for the experience she had at
[9:06] Louisiana Youth Camp. She was baptized
[9:09] after Saturday night service. Somebody
[9:11] say, "Praise the Lord."
[9:14] Amen. So glad for all these testimonies.
[9:17] We know that we're serving a a wonderful
[9:20] risen Lord Jesus Christ. He is our hope
[9:23] tonight. How about you? Is he your hope
[9:26] tonight? Amen. Let's stand to our feet
[9:28] if you will. Let's sing that together
[9:30] once again as we just get ready to pray
[9:32] over these needs tonight. We just want
[9:34] to commit all these things unto the Lord
[9:36] and ask brother Fred if he would come
[9:38] just in a minute and we'll pray. Let's
[9:40] sing this song together. We're going to
[9:43] make it now. We act like we're losers
[9:45] sometimes, but really we are the
[9:48] winners. There's more for us than there
[9:50] is there against us. Right. I heard
[9:53] brother Brand was selling a tape just
[9:54] the other day. He was having a meeting
[9:56] somewhere in a big auditorium and the
[9:58] acoustics were real bad and he was just
[10:00] struggling and he said, "I really don't
[10:02] like to have a meeting in this kind of a
[10:05] a building." He preferred a church. He
[10:07] said, "They're just little devils." He
[10:10] said, "A little devil sitting
[10:12] everywhere." And I said, "Well, you
[10:14] know, come to think about it, he ain't
[10:16] nothing but a little
[10:18] imp. That's all Satan is. is just a
[10:20] little oimp that we let him buffalo us
[10:23] and push us around. We're serving a
[10:25] risen Jesus Christ. Do you believe that?
[10:28] Give him a good hand clap of praise
[10:29] tonight if you love
[10:33] him. Yes.
[10:35] I'm going
[10:38] to sing with all your heart.
[10:45] [Music]
[10:50] Thank you
[10:51] Lord. Sing it with your
[10:53] [Music]
[11:00] heart.
[11:01] He walks
[11:04] beside
[11:06] me.
[11:08] Heaven it's in my view.
[11:13] Oh,
[11:15] I'm going to
[11:18] make
[11:19] it through. You got to sing that one
[11:22] more time.
[11:24] Oh, yes. Now
[11:29] I Oh, thank you, Father. We love you
[11:33] tonight.
[11:38] Oh, and
[11:40] I'll keep right on
[11:45] trusting. He's working everything for my
[11:49] good.
[11:53] He walks beside the
[11:58] pretty and heaven is in my Oh
[12:04] yes
[12:06] I'm going to
[12:09] make
[12:11] it through.
[12:13] [Music]
[12:19] He walks me. Oh, he walks beside us
[12:23] tonight, church. Heaven is in my Oh,
[12:30] yes. Now
[12:32] I'm going to
[12:35] make it
[12:45] through. Hallelujah. Let's go to the
[12:47] Lord in prayer tonight. Brother Fred,
[12:49] God bless you, buddy. Appreciate you.
[12:51] Appreciate you. God bless you, buddy.
[12:54] I think he's wanting my
[12:59] shirt. Let's bow our heads and go to the
[13:01] Lord in
[13:03] prayer. Oh, Father, how
[13:06] we just
[13:08] so drawn out the whole day, Lord, just
[13:13] wanting to be with you. And as we gather
[13:16] together, Lord, to remember your
[13:20] name, to glorify you,
[13:23] we ask you to take the word of God and
[13:26] comfort each and every heart. Lord,
[13:30] bring us to that place, Lord, where you
[13:32] can speak to us because that's why we're
[13:36] here, Lord. Thank you. We so long all
[13:39] day, Lord, to hear your voice, to see
[13:44] your face. And Lord, as we look around
[13:47] the world, and we see you in so many
[13:51] ways. And we just want to hear you say,
[13:54] "It is enough. Come
[13:57] home. We long for you, Lord. We long for
[14:01] your
[14:02] word. Be in our presence, Lord, and be
[14:05] welcome tonight. Let us open our hearts
[14:09] God as you bring refreshing to us Lord.
[14:13] Speak to us Lord and help us Lord in
[14:15] this dark generation that we live. Help
[14:18] us to be better stewards Lord.
[14:21] Take each and every prayer request Lord
[14:24] and give each and every one of us the
[14:26] faith and the strength to stand and say
[14:30] our God can and our God will for us
[14:34] because we have faith in you Lord that
[14:38] you will do mighty things among your
[14:42] people Lord. We pray God that you would
[14:45] do these things for us. Not that we are
[14:49] arrogant in
[14:51] knowledge Lord. We don't want to be
[14:53] arrogant in knowledge Lord but we want
[14:55] to acknowledge your word Lord and we
[14:57] love it so much Lord. So as our hearts
[15:01] beat within us today Lord come and take
[15:04] your word and beat out any pride or
[15:07] anything that's un unwilling and un
[15:10] unsatisfying to you. beat it out of us,
[15:12] Lord, because we don't want it, Lord. We
[15:16] only want you. And we want the son of
[15:18] God to be aresh in our hearts as as we
[15:22] shine in the world. We want others to
[15:24] know, God, that there is a living God
[15:27] that's full of love and joy and peace
[15:30] and
[15:31] greatness. And it's nothing of our own
[15:34] selves and nothing that we could do to
[15:36] even be saved.
[15:38] So Lord, come and be among us tonight.
[15:42] Touch each and every heart, Father, and
[15:45] let us be comforted by your word. In
[15:48] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[15:52] Thank you, brother Fred. God bless. You
[15:54] can be seated tonight. Ushers, if you
[15:57] will come at this time, receive the
[15:59] evening offering. You give us unto the

[16:06] greater than Jesus. How many of you can

[25:21] mercy walked
[25:26] in.
[25:28] Mercy walked in.
[25:33] Completed my
[25:37] case, called to the
[25:42] stand. God's
[25:44] saving
[25:46] grace, the
[25:49] blood was
[25:51] presented that
[25:53] covered my sin.
[25:59] forgiven when
[26:02] mercy walked
[26:07] in. I stood
[26:10] there
[26:12] wondering now, how
[26:14] could this
[26:17] be that
[26:19] someone so
[26:22] guilty had just been set
[26:28] [Music]
[26:30] free? My
[26:32] chains were broken.
[26:36] I felt
[26:37] born
[26:40] again. The
[26:42] moment when
[26:45] mercy walked
[26:50] in,
[26:52] mercy walked
[26:55] in and
[26:57] pleaded my case.
[27:02] called
[27:03] to
[27:06] stand. God's
[27:08] saving
[27:10] grace. The
[27:13] blood was
[27:15] presented that
[27:17] covered my
[27:19] [Applause]
[27:21] sin
[27:23] for when mercy.
[27:26] [Music]
[27:32] Because it
[27:34] reaches to the
[27:37] highest
[27:42] mountain. It
[27:44] flows to the
[27:47] Lord lowest valley.
[27:54] The
[27:54] blood that gives me
[27:57] straight from
[28:00] day to
[28:01] [Applause]
[28:03] day. It'll
[28:06] never
[28:08] lose its
[28:12] power because it
[28:15] reaches to the
[28:18] highest mountain.
[28:23] [Music]
[28:24] It
[28:25] flows to the
[28:28] Lord with
[28:31] [Music]
[28:33] smiling. The
[28:35] blood gives me
[28:38] strength from
[28:41] day to
[28:43] day. It'll
[28:46] never lose.
[28:50] It's
[28:51] [Music]
[28:53] power. The blood
[28:56] was
[28:58] presented that covered my sin.
[29:06] forgiven when
[29:09] mercy walked in.
[29:12] [Music]
[29:20] [Applause]
[29:52] [Music]
[30:08] Lord, you know I need a brand new
[30:15] touch. My strength from
[30:18] yesterday is gone.
[30:21] [Music]
[30:24] But if you'll give me Lord another
[30:31] touch, I'll have the strength to carry
[30:35] on.
[30:40] I thought the sun had come to
[30:46] stay, but all too soon it went
[30:54] away. And in its place the storm clouds
[31:02] came. And with the clouds there came the
[31:10] rain. It rained so hard and oh so
[31:17] long. But midst the storm I felt a
[31:23] [Music]
[31:25] calm. It was your touch that brought me
[31:29] through it all.
[31:33] Without your help, I'd surely
[31:40] fall. Lord, you know I need a brand new
[31:46] [Music]
[31:47] touch. My strength from
[31:50] yesterday is gone.
[31:54] [Music]
[31:56] But if you'll give me Lord another
[32:00] [Applause]
[32:02] touch, I'll have the strength to carry
[32:06] on.
[32:08] [Music]
[32:12] Yesterday is come and
[32:18] gone and now a new day is coming
[32:25] on. I do not know what it may bring.
[32:33] My heart may cry instead of
[32:38] [Music]
[32:40] sing, but it matters not what comes my
[32:44] way.
[32:47] Lord, if you'll just touch me new each
[32:55] day. Your loving touch drives all my
[32:59] fears away.
[33:01] [Applause]
[33:03] Close by your side. I'm going to
[33:07] [Music]
[33:10] stay. Lord, you know how weak I really
[33:17] am. Even better than myself.
[33:25] But with your help, I know I really
[33:31] can make it through the darkest
[33:35] night. Everything's going to be all
[33:43] right. Lord, you know I need a brand new
[33:50] touch. My strength from
[33:53] yesterday's gone.
[33:58] But if you'll give me Lord another
[34:04] touch, I'll have the strength to carry
[34:09] on. If you'll touch me, Lord, I'll have
[34:14] the strength to carry
[34:17] on. Won't you touch me, Lord? Give me
[34:21] the strength to carry on.
[34:24] [Music]
[34:29] [Applause]
[34:33] [Music]
[34:45] [Music]
[34:58] Through out my years from a little
[35:03] child, I can honestly say God has stayed
[35:09] by my side.
[35:12] Although I didn't
[35:14] claim him as my
[35:17] Lord, he loved me through
[35:21] rebellion to his word. And I could hear
[35:26] a distant
[35:28] voice calling me
[35:31] home. He never left me alone.
[35:42] Since I walked in this glorious light,
[35:48] Satan battles and I am in a constant
[35:54] fight. But the Lord, he still helps me
[35:59] to
[36:00] overcome. He knows the pressure that's
[36:03] been left on the bride.
[36:08] Each day is another step closer home.
[36:14] He's been there every
[36:17] day. He never left me
[36:22] [Music]
[36:25] alone. He's
[36:27] always been
[36:32] there. He saw each valley.
[36:39] He knew every
[36:43] heartache that I
[36:46] went
[36:51] through. He knew the pain and
[36:58] despair. He heard every
[37:01] tear. Drop that fellow.
[37:06] Thank
[37:10] God he never left me
[37:19] alone. In the darkness of the midnight,
[37:23] I hear Satan come around. He says,
[37:26] "You're losing that battle. You're not
[37:30] gaining ground."
[37:33] And just as I'm giving up, I hear that
[37:37] same voice saying,
[37:40] "Child, pick up your
[37:45] sword." And through the
[37:48] word I hear him say, "I will never leave
[37:54] you fighting alone."
[37:57] [Music]
[38:00] He's
[38:01] always been
[38:06] there. He saw each
[38:12] valley. He knew every
[38:17] heartache that
[38:18] I
[38:20] went
[38:22] through.
[38:24] knew. He knew the pain and
[38:31] despair. He heard each
[38:35] tear. Drop that fellow. Oh, I thank
[38:43] God he never left me alone.
[38:51] He knew the pain and
[38:57] despair. He heard every
[39:00] tear. Drop that fellow. Oh, I thank
[39:09] God he never left me alone.
[39:16] Oh. Oh. I thank
[39:22] God he never left
[39:26] me alone.
[39:33] [Music]
[39:38] [Applause]
[39:56] Lord, I cannot
[39:58] imagine trying to live this life in this
[40:02] age, the craziest of all ages, the worst
[40:07] time for a human being to be on the
[40:09] earth. Amen. And there's 7 billion
[40:12] people think they're doing
[40:14] great. It shows how insane the world is,
[40:17] does it not?
[40:19] Let's stand
[40:20] together. Let me just look at y'all for
[40:22] a few minutes before I read my
[40:24] scripture. I just
[40:27] want you all way back there in the back.
[40:33] Good to see you.
[40:35] [Applause]
[40:43] Amen. I bring you greetings tonight from
[40:48] Rome,
[40:50] Venice,
[40:52] Philippines,
[40:54] Germany,
[40:57] Belgium, all over the world.
[41:00] saints of God that
[41:04] um were there at the meetings in
[41:06] Switzerland and brother Tom Ray, Brother
[41:09] Wayne Lawson just did an awesome job. I
[41:13] ain't going to say much about that other
[41:14] guy cuz y'all know how I feel about him.
[41:16] But those brothers done so good. The
[41:19] presence of God was just so wonderful.
[41:22] And I was able to meet for the first
[41:25] time many people that have streamed our
[41:28] services for years. some that went back
[41:30] plum to the 80s whenever we used to send
[41:33] out cassettes and you know
[41:36] they just so nice to be able to see the
[41:39] people of God think about what it's
[41:41] going to be one day when we all gather
[41:44] together.
[41:46] It's it's pretty sad whenever you gather
[41:49] in times like that. And brother David
[41:51] Mayor and his family took us to the
[41:53] airport yesterday in
[41:54] Geneva and they went with us as far as
[41:58] they could go till we had to go into the
[42:01] French side of Geneva and it just felt
[42:04] so so sad, so lonely. And I told him, I
[42:09] said, "I don't do good on goodbyes."
[42:12] Yeah. But I couldn't keep from thinking
[42:14] about what a time it's going to be when
[42:17] the saints of God gather together.
[42:20] So after most of the services, people
[42:23] standing up on the outside there wanting
[42:26] photos. So I kept telling Carol, "Come
[42:28] on, free trip to Pakistan. Free trip to
[42:31] India. No jet
[42:34] lag." But I'll tell you one thing. I've
[42:37] preached all over the world. Ain't no
[42:39] place I'd rather preach than right here.
[42:41] Yes. Amen. Amen. I mean, they have with
[42:43] all my
[42:45] heart. We thank God for the privilege
[42:47] for us to be able to walk together,
[42:49] don't we? Amen. Let's turn tonight, if
[42:52] you would, to Genesis chapter 24, verse
[42:55] 21.
[42:59] God's word is so
[43:02] wonderful and I love it not because that
[43:05] it's just so simple but yet because it
[43:10] can have its complex parts and its
[43:15] poetry, its a love story, its songs, its
[43:19] worship, its history. It records the bad
[43:25] parts of good people's lives,
[43:28] which shows you it was inspiration of
[43:31] God. Cuz most of us would never write
[43:34] what's in the Bible. Most would never
[43:37] write about our family or our heritage
[43:41] what God had the authors of scripture to
[43:43] write. So, it shows to me again that
[43:44] it's inspired by doing so. It wrote
[43:47] horrific things that they did, but God
[43:51] wanted it to be there for our examples.
[43:54] Thank God that we have those good things
[43:56] there and we can learn by them. But I'm
[43:58] grateful also for the bad things because
[44:01] we can learn by them as well. Aren't you
[44:03] grateful? We'll pick up again tonight in
[44:06] Genesis chapter 24 verse
[44:11] 21. And the man wondering at
[44:15] her held his
[44:18] peace to wit whether the Lord had made
[44:21] his journey prosperous or
[44:23] not. And it came to pass as the camels
[44:26] had done drinking that the man took a
[44:29] golden earring of half a shekele weight,
[44:31] two bracelets for her hands of 10
[44:34] shekels weight of gold, and said, "Whose
[44:37] daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray
[44:40] thee." Anybody know how old she
[44:45] is? Anybody
[44:48] know? The ripe old
[44:52] age of
[44:59] 16. So, how many of your parents with
[45:01] 16-year-old daughters would send them
[45:04] off with this man right
[45:07] here? You can't Google him. He has no
[45:10] real ID.
[45:12] He has no passport.
[45:15] All he has is his word with a bunch of
[45:18] camels, wealth, riches, and some
[45:21] servants other than himself. No way to
[45:24] check him up, no way to Google him, no
[45:27] way to call somebody and find out. Would
[45:32] you send your daughter with such a
[45:35] man, especially 16 years old? And she
[45:38] never her whole life ever got to go back
[45:45] home. But the prophet said it was the
[45:49] message that got her.
[45:54] The message. You see, one reason that
[45:56] we've had so many folks to pull away
[45:58] from the message in the last few
[46:00] years is because they got the message,
[46:06] but the message never got them.
[46:10] But if the message grabs your soul,
[46:15] you'll never be able to get away from
[46:16] it. But if you just grab the message, oh
[46:20] man, this is this is good. Boy, this is
[46:22] some really good stuff. then somebody
[46:24] else will come along with some better
[46:26] stuff cuz the message just ain't stuff.
[46:30] It's a message from God.
[46:34] Now listen what she's going to face
[46:37] here. Now he asked her further
[46:40] identification. Whose daughter art thou?
[46:43] Tell me I praise thee. Is there room in
[46:47] thy father's house for us to lodge in?
[46:50] Now remember these are all pointed
[46:53] questions are not just random. He's not
[46:56] just trying to make a conversation. He's
[46:59] there to find a mate. The questions are
[47:03] pointed in a direction. He can ask the
[47:06] question but he cannot give her the
[47:08] answer. But her answer will further
[47:11] identify her if she's the
[47:15] match. And said whose daughter out there
[47:18] tell me I pray thee. There's there room
[47:19] in thy father's house for us to lodge
[47:22] in. And she said unto
[47:23] him, I
[47:26] am the daughter of
[47:29] Bethule, the son of
[47:32] Mila, which she bare unto Nahor. She
[47:37] said, Moreover, unto him, we have both
[47:41] straw and
[47:43] proender, enough, and room to lodge in.
[47:47] Now notice when the man
[47:50] worships, when the woman answers his
[47:54] questions without him telling her what
[47:57] to say. So he doesn't just worship God
[48:00] once he delivers his part, but he
[48:03] worships God when she answers the right
[48:07] thing. And the man bowed down his
[48:11] head and worshiped the Lord. And once
[48:15] again, I'd like to ask you tonight,
[48:18] whose daughter are you?
[48:20] Whose son are you?
[48:23] Your answer will make the angels rejoice
[48:28] if it's the right answer. Amen. Let me
[48:31] let it be remembered tonight as we
[48:33] pray. Heavenly Father, we love you so
[48:36] much.
[48:38] Thank you, Lord Jesus, for being with
[48:41] Carol and myself as we went this long,
[48:44] arduous journey, and you brought us back
[48:47] safely, Lord. And we're so
[48:50] thankful, still rejoicing as to what we
[48:54] saw you do in the meetings. And Father,
[48:56] it was such an awesome time to be
[48:59] together with the saints of God. And as
[49:02] I would stand there each service, the
[49:04] ones I was ministering in and the ones
[49:06] that I was just there supporting the
[49:08] other brothers in and hear the saints
[49:10] sing and
[49:12] worship. Different ones would come in
[49:14] and they'd grab headsets because they
[49:17] couldn't understand English or French
[49:19] and they would speak German or they
[49:22] would speak Kiswahili or Arabic or
[49:26] whatever it was.
[49:27] And as I watched that each service, I
[49:30] thought, what a day it'll be when we'll
[49:34] all be gathered together and there'll be
[49:36] no division of language, no division of
[49:40] any type. Lord, many of those people
[49:42] come through and they wanted to shake my
[49:45] hand, Brother Wayne's hand, Brother
[49:47] Tom's hand, Carol, they'd want to meet
[49:49] our wives and they couldn't say anything
[49:52] to us. So, they just kind of fold their
[49:55] hands and bow their heads or something
[49:57] or smile or just shake your hand. And
[50:00] Lord, it I thought how how terrible in
[50:03] one sense of the word that the barrier
[50:05] of language has so divided us. But yet
[50:08] we have a language which was common to
[50:11] us all and it was the message of the
[50:14] hour. And for that we are so grateful.
[50:18] We've gathered here tonight, Father,
[50:20] that we might be able to talk a little
[50:22] bit more about our messenger, but that
[50:25] we also could talk about you, of course,
[50:28] and we could talk about ourselves and
[50:32] what we could do to be a better people
[50:35] in response to this message that you've
[50:38] sent to us in the last day. For we know
[50:41] that we are stewards. Stewards are
[50:44] giving something that does not belong to
[50:48] them. It's it can be multiple things. It
[50:52] can be one thing that's a major, other
[50:55] things that are several minors. For
[50:57] some, it's been given to them many
[51:00] majors. Church age messengers and great
[51:02] people like that. But yet, Father,
[51:05] whatever has been given to our charge,
[51:08] we want to handle that and be stewards
[51:11] in the right way. There may be people
[51:14] here tonight that's so poor and they
[51:16] think stewardship is all about money.
[51:18] But not necessarily. Each of us are
[51:21] stewards with our time, stewards with
[51:25] our love, stewards with our kindness,
[51:29] stewards with our forgiveness. There's
[51:32] so much that we have a stewardship
[51:35] about. We do not want to fail you, Lord.
[51:38] Speak to us tonight from your word. Help
[51:41] me tonight, Jesus. I pray to be able to
[51:44] get out of the way. We love you, Father,
[51:47] in Jesus name. And the saints said,
[51:50] "Amen." Amen. God bless you. You may be
[51:53] seated. I do need a little bit of prayer
[51:57] tonight. Me and Carol got up at
[52:00] um 6:00 uh yesterday morning. That was
[52:04] Switzerland time, which was u few
[52:07] minutes after 12 a.m. your time. And we
[52:11] got in bed last night a little bit after
[52:13] 1 your time. So that was about 25 hours
[52:17] anyway you count it up with no sleep and
[52:20] u I don't know what in the world has
[52:22] happened to me but since I've moved from
[52:25] 32 and I'm double that now I just can't
[52:28] go like I did and I'm trying my best to
[52:31] figure it out. So if any of y'all can
[52:33] let me know what happened just kindly
[52:35] send me an email about that. But I would
[52:37] appreciate your prayers. many many airs
[52:40] hours rather in flight and and uh
[52:42] sitting in the airport a long time. But
[52:45] I thought, you know what? I just don't
[52:47] think I can be able to be at church
[52:48] Wednesday night, not get up and try to
[52:50] preach. So, if you'll pull and pray for
[52:52] me, I believe the Lord will come by our
[52:54] way tonight. Y'all agree. Amen. It's
[52:57] such an honor for
[52:59] us. Praise the Lord. So let us look
[53:03] since we are part of the great economy
[53:06] of God. Let us look at the firstborn of
[53:11] this new genos which is a seed line of
[53:14] God. And I've read it to you before we
[53:18] left that he was the firstborn or the
[53:21] first begotten from the dead. But before
[53:24] he was given that title as the first
[53:27] begotten from the dead, we know that he
[53:30] was identified as the firstborn among
[53:33] many brethren. And it it's very
[53:36] important and vital actually that you
[53:39] and I know who we are. And we know it's
[53:42] not something that we get immediately
[53:44] when we're born again. My many of you
[53:46] have been around the message for
[53:48] decades. I myself been around it since
[53:50] the early 80s. And the more I study it,
[53:53] the more I look into it, the more I
[53:55] realize how little that I know, but also
[53:58] at the same time, how much more that I
[54:00] know now than I knew years ago. And I'm
[54:03] grateful for all of that. But I desire
[54:06] to know know more about who I am, who
[54:10] you are, who our our heavenly father is,
[54:13] and our relation to him and our position
[54:17] in the body of Christ. Does that make
[54:19] make sense to you? So, we know that
[54:21] Malachi 4 consists of three great parts.
[54:25] And God was the one who said it. Behold,
[54:28] I I God Almighty send unto you, the
[54:32] recipients of the message, Elijah the
[54:35] prophet. So for those who read only
[54:38] about brother Brandham in Malachi 4,
[54:41] they're leaving out God and they're
[54:43] leaving out other members of the bride
[54:45] of Christ. So there there is a great
[54:49] importance and a great value of each of
[54:52] us that are called of God in that place.
[54:55] Now you know looking at Abraham, he was
[54:58] a great great man. Jacob was another
[55:00] great man. But we have wedged in between
[55:04] those two great men another man which
[55:08] was not as great. Ever wonder why that
[55:11] there's not many books written about
[55:13] Isaac? Hollywood has made so many books
[55:16] and and movies and things about Abraham
[55:19] and they skip Isaac, come right back,
[55:21] make many, many more about Jacob.
[55:24] There's many, many that they made about
[55:26] David. And there's certain characters
[55:28] that they've made many of, even
[55:29] Hollywood and authors. But yet there's
[55:31] people like Isaac that are totally
[55:34] overlooked because they're sort of
[55:37] mediocre type of Bible characters as
[55:40] there are many many of them in the Bible
[55:42] which most of us that's what we would be
[55:45] and yet if it was not for an Isaac there
[55:48] would not have been a Jacob was there
[55:51] not for those people that would be
[55:54] wedged in between great people then
[55:57] there wouldn't really be any value by
[56:00] which to estimate the value of those who
[56:03] are great. But at the same time, it
[56:06] doesn't mean that those who are lesser
[56:08] than that are not important in the
[56:11] economy of God. And when you and I look
[56:13] at oursel and we think, well, we're not
[56:16] really anything. No, I disagree with you
[56:19] on that. If we are saved and we're part
[56:22] of the economy of God, there is
[56:24] something of value about every one of
[56:27] us. Now, are we great? Now, that's
[56:29] totally different. No, we're not great,
[56:31] but we are something. We are purchased
[56:34] by the blood. And the blood caused him a
[56:38] great deal in order for him to produce
[56:41] the product of the blood to be able to
[56:43] buy us. Now, let's read again if you
[56:45] would in Romans 8 29. So Jesus is the
[56:50] firstborn for whom he did forno he also
[56:54] did predestinate which is predetermine
[56:58] your destiny to be conformed to the
[57:01] image of his son that he might be the
[57:04] firstborn among many brethren that he
[57:08] might be the firstborn among many
[57:11] brethren. Now, he's not the first son,
[57:15] and he's not the first child. Neither
[57:18] was he the first one that would have
[57:20] been born in the first century. So, how
[57:23] is he? And how was he to be named the
[57:28] firstborn among many brethren? Now, we
[57:31] know that Adam was the first one
[57:33] created, but Adam was not born cuz it
[57:36] didn't have a mother. So how was Jesus
[57:40] being the firstborn and he was also
[57:43] identified as not just being the only
[57:46] one in the family but the firstborn of
[57:50] many brethren and yet our mother was not
[57:54] his mother. Well, how is it that he had
[57:58] both father which was spirit God and he
[58:01] was given his his incubator mother was
[58:05] given the opportunity to be able to bear
[58:08] the great identification of carrying the
[58:11] word and what a great honor it were it
[58:13] was and even the angel referred to her
[58:17] as his mother and when he was on the
[58:19] cross he tells John behold thy mother.
[58:23] So as far as an identification, she was
[58:26] given that honor that yet how does that
[58:29] make us of his same family and of his
[58:33] same kind? My mama was not Mary. Your
[58:38] mama was not Mary. My father in the as
[58:42] far as in the likeness of my image was
[58:46] not God. It was Don Reagan. Yours was
[58:50] whatever his name was. But unless
[58:52] there's another burst that's going to
[58:55] bring us into this scripture of Romans
[58:59] 8:28, it's going to produce mass
[59:01] confusion because his father was God.
[59:05] Mine was Don. Yours was Gary, which is
[59:09] not the same. Gary and God, it ain't the
[59:12] same. Uh do God and Don Reagan? No, it
[59:16] ain't the same. God and Greg Parker, it
[59:20] ain't the same. So, how am I and Jesus a
[59:25] part of the same family of God? How are
[59:28] you, brother Harvey and Jesus
[59:32] brothers? How are you, brother Fred, a
[59:35] brother to the Lord Jesus in so much
[59:38] that God's prophet would call him our
[59:42] elder brother? It's mind-blowing. How
[59:46] could he be identified as our elder
[59:51] brother? Now watch this. I love the way
[59:53] the prophet goes into this. Notice the
[59:56] first thing he did after him his
[59:59] temptation in the wilderness. He came
[1:00:01] forth as the anointed Messiah. The
[1:00:05] Messiah, the Christ. Christ means the
[1:00:09] anointed one. Now listen to this. He was
[1:00:12] born Jesus the man. He was born
[1:00:18] Jesus the man. I know a lot of folks in
[1:00:21] the message still struggle with this and
[1:00:23] the bottom line is because of Jesus
[1:00:25] only. He was born Jesus the man. But
[1:00:30] when the Holy Ghost came into him, he
[1:00:35] was the anointed Messiah.
[1:00:39] So now he was not born the Christ. What
[1:00:44] did the angel say? Thou shalt call his
[1:00:47] name Jesus. He never instructed Mary to
[1:00:51] call his name Lord Jesus Christ. As a
[1:00:56] matter of fact, he was only called Lord
[1:00:59] Jesus Christ after his resurrection. So
[1:01:03] what do we see then? We actually see the
[1:01:07] unfolding of God when God was becoming
[1:01:12] his people.
[1:01:14] Now listen to me. God was
[1:01:19] becoming his people. In order to make
[1:01:24] his people him, he had to become his
[1:01:30] people. Now listen, he was born Jesus
[1:01:33] the man. But when the Holy Ghost came
[1:01:36] into him, he was the anointed Messiah.
[1:01:40] The Bible said God was in Christ
[1:01:42] reconciling the world to himself. Now
[1:01:45] notice God living in him. The fullness
[1:01:49] of the Godhead was in him. God was
[1:01:52] poured all he was into Christ. Christ
[1:01:55] poured all he was into the church. Now I
[1:02:00] don't have all of that. Praise the Lord.
[1:02:04] Now Jesus could say things about his
[1:02:07] position I cannot say about mine. Jesus
[1:02:11] could say he was the fullness of the
[1:02:14] Godhead bodily. I might say it but it
[1:02:18] ain't the truth. I'm only a portion.
[1:02:21] You're only a portion. Now when people
[1:02:24] will stand and say I'm the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:26] I'm God. I'm this or that. No you ain't.
[1:02:30] You're a liar. You don't know what
[1:02:32] you're talking about. You are not the
[1:02:34] fullness of God. Now, everything that
[1:02:38] would be in the Atlantic Ocean and it's
[1:02:41] a big ocean. So, whenever we flew out of
[1:02:44] there yesterday and we flew about oh
[1:02:47] 4,500 no 4,35 miles something like that
[1:02:50] from the time we left Paris until we
[1:02:53] reached Atlanta and a big a large span
[1:02:57] of that was flying over the Atlantic.
[1:02:59] Now, you could be able to look at that
[1:03:01] value, that volumes of water in the
[1:03:04] Atlantic and be able to break it down
[1:03:06] and all the chemicals and things that
[1:03:08] would be in there and measure it. And
[1:03:10] you could also step right down there and
[1:03:12] pick up a tablespoon and be able to come
[1:03:14] up with some of the exact same elements
[1:03:17] in the tablespoon that's in that t
[1:03:19] entire body of water. Is that right? So
[1:03:22] God himself would be the entire ocean of
[1:03:26] Godhead, love, mercy, kindness,
[1:03:28] generous, all that sort of thing. But
[1:03:30] take a little teaspoon, tablespoon, dip
[1:03:32] it inside of that, put it inside you and
[1:03:35] I, and you'll find some of the exact
[1:03:37] same attributes in that that you'd find
[1:03:40] in the entire ocean. But you're not
[1:03:42] going to find the same amount or the
[1:03:45] same volume or the same mass. But now
[1:03:48] notice, God emptied everything he was
[1:03:52] into the Lord Jesus. Now watch, God one
[1:03:55] day made a toxin. I'm going to say
[1:04:00] something. He didn't try it on a guinea
[1:04:02] pig either. He gave it to his son. He
[1:04:08] inoculated him at the Jordan when the
[1:04:12] Holy Ghost came down upon him. Amen.
[1:04:17] Now, can anybody agree with me tonight?
[1:04:19] According to the scripture and the
[1:04:21] message, Jesus was not born full of the
[1:04:25] Holy Ghost.
[1:04:27] He was born a man and he lived 30 years
[1:04:32] of his life as a man without the Holy
[1:04:36] Ghost. Come on, praise the Lord. Now,
[1:04:39] watch again. and calling Jesus on the
[1:04:41] scene. Remember, in flesh, he
[1:04:45] was just a man. Woo. Boy, you couldn't
[1:04:50] have got me to say this 44 years ago.
[1:04:52] Whatever it was, I I tell you one thing,
[1:04:55] I was Jesus only. I went from
[1:04:57] Trinitarian to Jesus only. That's right.
[1:05:00] Jesus only. That was it. So when I come
[1:05:03] to this message and I started running
[1:05:05] across things like this, I mean it was
[1:05:08] hard for me to swallow. It was very very
[1:05:11] hard for me to be able to break down
[1:05:13] because the way I was looking at it, I
[1:05:16] was taking away from the Lord Jesus. And
[1:05:19] I felt like that I was protecting him.
[1:05:23] So I would come to his defense. You're
[1:05:26] not taking that away from him. I won't
[1:05:28] let you do it. But it wasn't nobody else
[1:05:31] trying to take it away from him. He laid
[1:05:33] it aside himself. And now I look at that
[1:05:37] and I realize it was nothing but Satan
[1:05:40] trying to block me from understanding
[1:05:43] how low he condescended in order to come
[1:05:47] to my level. You understand that? Now
[1:05:50] you realize Satan will try to do some of
[1:05:52] you here that still don't see it right.
[1:05:54] And you think you're trying to protect
[1:05:56] the Lord Jesus. You're not. It's
[1:05:58] actually Satan using that perception to
[1:06:01] protect your tradition, not truth. It's
[1:06:05] your tradition because you'll never be
[1:06:08] able to see who you are until you see
[1:06:12] who he became.
[1:06:15] Now, he'll let you go down so far, but
[1:06:18] Satan will try to stop you from seeing
[1:06:21] actually how low the Lord Jesus went.
[1:06:25] Because there's something about it, it
[1:06:28] changes you if you ever go down there.
[1:06:31] It will absolutely change you when you
[1:06:34] see how low that he condescended to. Now
[1:06:37] he says, "Remember in flesh he was just
[1:06:41] a man, but in spirit he was God, but a
[1:06:46] man in flesh, therefore his body was a
[1:06:50] human being that was subject to
[1:06:55] temptations, subject to sickness, just
[1:06:58] the same as ours." And he said to put on
[1:07:02] to be a man, a human. But then he was
[1:07:05] God in spirit. He said, "I and my father
[1:07:09] are one. My father dwellestth in me."
[1:07:12] Now that same pillar of fire, the
[1:07:15] fatherhood came down and was made God in
[1:07:21] sunship. Now look, this is why that he
[1:07:25] could not be born the fullness of the
[1:07:27] Godhead bodily because that would have
[1:07:30] been God revealed in the same appearance
[1:07:34] as it was when he appeared to Abraham
[1:07:37] which was King Theophony. So he could
[1:07:40] not become sunship unless he laid aside
[1:07:44] that and then allowed the God part to
[1:07:48] come in the human part. Then it would be
[1:07:52] the godship stepping into the sunship
[1:07:55] which was what? A precursor of every son
[1:07:59] and daughter of God receiving the
[1:08:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost. If he would
[1:08:04] have been born with it, it would have
[1:08:06] not given you a fair chance because we
[1:08:09] would not be born with the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:11] So he said, "My children wasn't born
[1:08:14] with it, so I ain't going to be born
[1:08:15] with it either.
[1:08:18] I'm going to live 30 years of my life
[1:08:20] without it. I'm going to be a 10year-old
[1:08:22] boy without the Holy Ghost. I'm going to
[1:08:24] be a 13-year-old boy without the Holy
[1:08:27] Ghost. I'm going to live my teens
[1:08:30] without the Holy Ghost. I'm going to
[1:08:32] live my 20s without the Holy Ghost. I
[1:08:36] want to know how some of my my brothers
[1:08:39] are going to feel as they're going
[1:08:41] through life without the baptism of the
[1:08:44] Holy Ghost. I want to understand how
[1:08:46] they feel. Oh, what a high
[1:08:49] priest. Now, notice he says, "Oh my, he
[1:08:53] come down that pillar of fire, the
[1:08:55] fatherhood come down and was made God
[1:08:59] made God in sunship. He dwelt in the
[1:09:03] pillar of fire in the shakina glory. And
[1:09:05] he dwelt in a body which was the son
[1:09:08] that he created and made in the form of
[1:09:11] man so that he made him the son of God
[1:09:15] the second Adam. Of course now he had to
[1:09:17] come through the womb of a woman not
[1:09:20] like Adam because that's what he had to
[1:09:25] condemn the birth of a human being by a
[1:09:30] woman. I want you to notice how close it
[1:09:33] was though. the birth of a human being
[1:09:37] by a woman. Now, Jesus was a human being
[1:09:41] brought forth from a woman, but there
[1:09:44] was nothing of the woman's DNA or the
[1:09:48] woman's chromosomes that contributed at
[1:09:51] all to her incubating this word. You
[1:09:55] understand? Now, he says, "Oh my, that's
[1:09:59] what he had to condemn the birth of a
[1:10:01] human being by woman." So, he had to
[1:10:03] come that way. Now that's God the son
[1:10:06] the same God. Now he through the
[1:10:09] offering of that body without sin made a
[1:10:14] human offering. Now this is where that
[1:10:17] we come into. Now the question is how do
[1:10:20] you see yourself?
[1:10:23] So if Rebecca would have answered well I
[1:10:27] don't know if I want to tell you who I
[1:10:28] am. I'm not sure who you are. My mama
[1:10:30] told me not to speak to strangers. My
[1:10:33] daddy is instructing me to be wary of
[1:10:35] people that come in here and talk funny
[1:10:36] and act funny and you talk funny, you
[1:10:38] act funny. I can tell you ain't from
[1:10:40] around here. You're from somewhere else.
[1:10:42] And I'm taught to be careful around
[1:10:44] strangers. And I I'm not giving you my
[1:10:46] background. You You might show up at my
[1:10:48] door sometime. I don't know. I'm not
[1:10:50] going to answer any of that stuff to
[1:10:51] you. So, if she would have answered all
[1:10:54] of that, it would have been a repulsive
[1:10:57] response to the message. Now, keep in
[1:11:00] mind what this man is doing. He's
[1:11:02] bringing a message from his master. Her
[1:11:08] destiny will be determined by her
[1:11:12] response verbally and by her action to
[1:11:17] this message. It's not to the mercy of
[1:11:20] Abraham. It's not according to the looks
[1:11:24] of Isaac. It's not according to how many
[1:11:26] camels, how much gold, how much silver.
[1:11:30] None of that is going to determine her
[1:11:32] destiny. Her destiny will be revealed
[1:11:37] according to the way she identifies with
[1:11:40] this man's message. I hope somebody hear
[1:11:44] me tonight. Do you understand? Your
[1:11:47] destiny, word of light, church, is going
[1:11:50] to be determined by your response to the
[1:11:54] message of the hour. Amen. The people in
[1:11:58] Paul's day, those that accepted it will
[1:12:02] rejoice through eternity. Those that
[1:12:04] turn it down, you imagine when the
[1:12:06] judgment is set and the books are open
[1:12:09] and they all woke up before God. Those
[1:12:11] that ridiculed Paul, those that
[1:12:13] persecuted him, those that run him down,
[1:12:15] told lies on him, all that sort of
[1:12:17] thing, they will stand before God and
[1:12:20] the witness of the age will walk up into
[1:12:24] the judgment blocks. And there they will
[1:12:27] stand and the witnesses of the elect of
[1:12:29] God. And those who persecuted Paul will
[1:12:33] look on the other side of the throne and
[1:12:35] there will stand Paul and Timothy and
[1:12:38] Titus and Fleimon and the saints of God
[1:12:42] that they killed and crucified. Oh, you
[1:12:45] imagine what a fearful day it's going to
[1:12:47] be. Well, let's bring it on down to this
[1:12:49] day. The people that have run down the
[1:12:52] message of the hour and the messenger
[1:12:54] and called him a false prophet and a
[1:12:56] liar and a devil. how surprised they're
[1:12:59] going to be when they walk up before the
[1:13:01] throne of God and they're expecting to
[1:13:04] go in and shouting down the streets of
[1:13:06] gold. But I wonder how soon it'll be
[1:13:08] when they walk up there before they
[1:13:10] realize they're in bad trouble.
[1:13:15] Because right there beside the Lord
[1:13:18] Jesus will stand his prophet messenger
[1:13:21] for this age. And there will stand
[1:13:24] message pastors and message evangelists
[1:13:27] and message missionaries and then by our
[1:13:31] our divisions and the protocol of God.
[1:13:34] There will be saints of God that they've
[1:13:36] laughed at and ridiculed and made fun
[1:13:39] of. And they're not there just kind of
[1:13:41] waving hellos, but they're there in the
[1:13:44] judgment seat to pronounce judgment upon
[1:13:48] those that have turned him down.
[1:13:51] Oh my. Now think, Eleazar is not
[1:13:56] representing himself. It's not, oh well,
[1:14:00] I I really don't like the way you part
[1:14:02] your hair. I really don't like the way
[1:14:05] you dressed up those camels. It was not
[1:14:07] about him. He was not looking for a
[1:14:10] bride for himself. But it was all about
[1:14:14] his master. So the questions are said
[1:14:18] with his master's welfare in mind. He
[1:14:21] does not want to take a woman back that
[1:14:24] is not going to be matched up to his
[1:14:26] master. Now once he pronounces the the
[1:14:30] agreement there, do you understand that
[1:14:33] Isaac could not even change that?
[1:14:37] Abraham was all that he had. Abraham
[1:14:41] would whatever woman he took back,
[1:14:43] Abraham would have allowed that woman to
[1:14:46] be his wife.
[1:14:48] Abraham would not have stood there and
[1:14:51] said, "I don't like her. Her nose is too
[1:14:53] long. Her lips are too big. Her ears
[1:14:56] stick out too far from the side of her
[1:14:58] head." If
[1:15:00] Ele was the one who identified her as
[1:15:03] the bride, why? Because the angel of God
[1:15:07] went before him. You understand, friend,
[1:15:10] how important it is for us in this day
[1:15:13] and hour that we're living to respond to
[1:15:16] the message of the hour now? Not just by
[1:15:19] saying amen verbally, and we're supposed
[1:15:20] to do that, but by amening the word by
[1:15:24] the way that we live every day of our
[1:15:27] life. Amens are more than just sitting
[1:15:29] there in church and saying the word
[1:15:31] amen.
[1:15:33] Now watch, he says he be improving his
[1:15:37] word. He began to eat the fish and the
[1:15:41] bread and the so forth and it began to
[1:15:45] develop
[1:15:46] cells and then when it's fully matured
[1:15:49] at 30 years old he was baptized. Listen
[1:15:53] to this. I'll tell you what I just
[1:15:54] blowed me away then I read this. He was
[1:15:57] baptized in
[1:16:01] obedience to John.
[1:16:07] Can you imagine the lamb of God
[1:16:11] himself obeyed the teaching of a
[1:16:16] prophet? I wouldn't give you a nickel
[1:16:19] for any preacher that can't be led.
[1:16:24] I if you follow any preacher who can't
[1:16:26] be led, you've got poor discernment.
[1:16:29] Because a leader that cannot be led is
[1:16:33] not a God called leader. He's a dictator
[1:16:36] or he's a wannabe. You imagine the Lord
[1:16:40] Jesus actually submitting himself to the
[1:16:45] teaching of John the
[1:16:48] Baptist. Praise God. Notice this. Now he
[1:16:52] says, hallelujah. He was baptized in
[1:16:56] obedience to John down here or to God in
[1:16:59] the water. Now remember John was
[1:17:01] preaching. Repent. Got to be baptized.
[1:17:03] Got to be baptized. Here come Jesus.
[1:17:05] John
[1:17:06] said I can't baptize you. I'm not
[1:17:10] worthy. You need to baptize me. He said
[1:17:11] suffer it to be so. Let me obey the
[1:17:15] word. You have the message John of
[1:17:19] baptism. Father has ordained. Notice
[1:17:23] what did Jesus was said? You mean to
[1:17:24] tell me I'm going to church down there
[1:17:26] and some preacher is going to baptize
[1:17:30] me? Some
[1:17:32] preacher, some mort. I'm the logos. I'm
[1:17:36] the word. Oh my preach. But remember,
[1:17:39] he's down there to meet the father. And
[1:17:41] where you meet the father is obedience
[1:17:44] to the word of God. The Holy Ghost would
[1:17:47] not have come. Listen to me. The Holy
[1:17:49] Ghost would not have come had Jesus
[1:17:52] refused that promised word. But he's not
[1:17:55] going to refuse it. Why? It's in him to
[1:17:57] fulfill all scripture. Now watch what he
[1:17:59] done. And he said, John, whenever he's
[1:18:02] down there in the water, and he went
[1:18:04] out, what happened? The dove, which was
[1:18:06] God descending from heaven with a voice
[1:18:09] saying, "This is my beloved son in whom
[1:18:11] I'm pleased to dwell." What did he come
[1:18:13] to do? Redeem that part of the earth.
[1:18:18] Now remember, God had not had a
[1:18:20] permanent flesh body until this time. So
[1:18:24] he would appear in elements of the
[1:18:26] earth. He would use them to drop back
[1:18:28] down to the earth. But now God said,
[1:18:30] "From this part of the earth, I will
[1:18:34] redeem it. I will sanctify it and set it
[1:18:37] apart and I will live in it. And I'm
[1:18:40] going to take this part of the earth.
[1:18:42] This is my part of the earth right here.
[1:18:45] The great creator. This is my part of
[1:18:47] the earth and from this part I will
[1:18:51] redeem all the rest of it to redeem that
[1:18:55] part of the earth. He was the beginning
[1:18:57] of the creation of God because God Amen
[1:19:01] is not a
[1:19:02] creation only in
[1:19:05] Christ. Amen. He is a creation because
[1:19:09] God is eternal and a spirit and a spirit
[1:19:13] is not created. He was the beginning of
[1:19:16] the creation of God. And God
[1:19:21] redeemed that
[1:19:23] body. How?
[1:19:26] Presence. P R E S E N C E.
[1:19:30] Presence. The presence of God. Now, it
[1:19:34] did not have no sin, so it didn't need
[1:19:36] blood. What would redeem him and set him
[1:19:40] apart from everything else? The Holy
[1:19:42] Ghost. God redeemed that body. See, when
[1:19:46] he come down, when he come down and he
[1:19:49] said, "This is my beloved son. I am well
[1:19:52] pleased in him." Now, who are you then?
[1:19:57] Well, I I'm just some poor old person
[1:19:59] that's trying to hang on. I don't know
[1:20:01] if I'm saved or not. Sometimes I think I
[1:20:03] am. Sometimes I think I'm bride.
[1:20:05] Sometimes I think I'm foolish virgin.
[1:20:07] Sometimes I think I'm part of that old
[1:20:09] Jezebel church. That sound like to me
[1:20:11] you need to find out who you are. You
[1:20:13] need to find out which side of the fence
[1:20:15] you belong on and give everything you
[1:20:17] are to that. If you're bride tonight,
[1:20:20] then act like bride, talk like bride,
[1:20:22] live like bride, go to church like
[1:20:24] bride, be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:20:26] like
[1:20:28] bride. Notice Hebrews 2:10. For it
[1:20:32] became him for whom are all things and
[1:20:36] by whom are all things? and bringing
[1:20:40] many
[1:20:41] sons unto
[1:20:44] glory. Bringing many sons unto glory to
[1:20:48] make the captain of their
[1:20:51] salvation perfect through sufferings.
[1:20:55] For both he that sanctifith and they who
[1:20:58] are sanctified are all of one. For which
[1:21:02] cause he is not ashamed to call them
[1:21:06] brethren. So Christ and these sons are
[1:21:11] relation. You see, it's not like the
[1:21:14] majority of Christians believe it that
[1:21:17] God somehow by his grace, you know, give
[1:21:19] us his grace and his mercy and he
[1:21:22] changed us from something else and made
[1:21:24] us sons. We were sons of the devil and
[1:21:27] we were this and that and the other. Oh
[1:21:29] no, that's not true at all. The the
[1:21:32] thing of it is he come to seek and to
[1:21:34] save that which was lost. Amen.
[1:21:37] Redemption only includes those who were
[1:21:40] already his.
[1:21:43] That's right. Notice St. John 20 and 17.
[1:21:47] Jesus said unto her, "Touch me not, for
[1:21:50] I'm not yet ascended to my father, but
[1:21:52] go to
[1:21:57] read it. Go to
[1:22:03] my
[1:22:04] brethren and say unto them, I ascend
[1:22:09] unto
[1:22:12] my father and
[1:22:16] your father to my God and
[1:22:21] now you see after he is raised from the
[1:22:24] dead he changes the position of his
[1:22:28] brothers or his disciples. Now whenever
[1:22:31] it must have been a very important thing
[1:22:33] for the Lord Jesus to bear this thing
[1:22:35] that for Mary to take this message back
[1:22:38] and he said go tell my brothers not my
[1:22:41] servants, my slaves, my bondervants, all
[1:22:44] of that. Go and tell that bunch of
[1:22:46] devils. I'm going to try to get them
[1:22:48] saved if I can. Go tell Peter that sorry
[1:22:51] outfit done denied me and everything
[1:22:53] else. I cannot believe he'd done such a
[1:22:55] thing on second thought. I'm not sure I
[1:22:57] even want him in my church. But he said,
[1:22:59] "Go tell my brothers that I've raised
[1:23:02] from the dead." Now, that within itself
[1:23:04] was phenomenal. But then he goes a step
[1:23:07] further and go tell them that I'm going
[1:23:10] to ascend up to my God, but not only my
[1:23:13] God, but now he's your God. on the same
[1:23:17] level of sunship or position. So he that
[1:23:23] was the
[1:23:24] sanctifier has now sanctified the
[1:23:27] brethren there and also the future
[1:23:30] brethren which are to come in the church
[1:23:33] ages that they might all be of one
[1:23:36] family. Notice again Hebrews 10:10. by
[1:23:39] the which which we are all sanctified
[1:23:42] through the offering of the body of
[1:23:44] Jesus Christ once and for all. Aren't
[1:23:47] you glad I don't have to die every day
[1:23:49] for you? Once a year, once every six
[1:23:51] months. Notice in verse 14, for by one
[1:23:54] offering he hath perfected forever them
[1:23:58] that are sanctified. So after
[1:24:03] sanctification comes perfection. Amen.
[1:24:07] He hath perfected forever them that are
[1:24:11] sanctified. Listen to this now. In the
[1:24:13] unveiling of God, God veiled in Jesus to
[1:24:16] do the work of redemption at the cross.
[1:24:19] God could not die as a spirit. He's
[1:24:22] eternal, but he had to put on a mask and
[1:24:27] act the part of death. He did die, but
[1:24:31] he couldn't do it in his god form. He
[1:24:35] had to do it in son form.
[1:24:40] Now, not another person that God sent
[1:24:42] his little boy. God, you know, oh, he's
[1:24:46] up there high and holy and righteous and
[1:24:48] and here's one God and here's another
[1:24:50] God on on a small throne. And the daddy
[1:24:53] reached over his son said, "What do you
[1:24:54] think, son? Daddy, I'll go down and do
[1:24:56] it. If you if you want me to, daddy,
[1:24:58] I'll do it. I I don't want to do it, but
[1:25:00] daddy, I'll go. I mean, I I'll go. Well,
[1:25:03] they're all going to be lost if we don't
[1:25:04] do something. Daddy, we we've got to
[1:25:06] come up with a plan. Boy, are those
[1:25:07] things. I mean, there may not be nobody
[1:25:09] saved. Uh, that's the modern theology of
[1:25:12] the world. He already knew who's going
[1:25:13] to be saved. Is that right? There's
[1:25:16] already a cross before the man was lost.
[1:25:19] There's already a plan before there was
[1:25:20] a man. So, it wasn't two beings sitting
[1:25:24] up there talking in heaven, but it was
[1:25:26] God himself projecting his own thoughts
[1:25:30] of what he wanted to become. But he
[1:25:32] couldn't do it in God form. Well, you
[1:25:35] could not receive the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:38] sinner form.
[1:25:40] That's why that people come up and say,
[1:25:42] "Well, praise God, I got born again.
[1:25:44] Hallelujah. I got born again." All that
[1:25:46] happened to them was they got justified
[1:25:48] by faith and forgiven of their sins. A
[1:25:50] sinner cannot receive the baptism of the
[1:25:52] Holy Ghost in their soul. You
[1:25:54] understand? They cannot receive deity in
[1:25:58] their sinner form. They've got to get
[1:26:01] into the stage of the process of the new
[1:26:04] birth before they can receive the
[1:26:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul.
[1:26:08] God cannot break his pattern. A person
[1:26:12] cannot receive the Holy Ghost just when
[1:26:15] they're justified form. The only way the
[1:26:18] Holy Ghost will come into the soul is
[1:26:20] whenever the person has come through
[1:26:22] justification, true sanctification, then
[1:26:25] that makes a way for the baptism of the
[1:26:27] Holy Ghost to come in their soul.
[1:26:29] Because the Holy Ghost can only come
[1:26:31] into a soul when it's in its sanctified
[1:26:34] form.
[1:26:36] Amen. And God could not die in God form.
[1:26:40] God could only die in son form.
[1:26:44] Now notice he said he couldn't do it in
[1:26:47] his God form. He had to do it in his son
[1:26:49] form as son of man on earth. See, he had
[1:26:54] to be son form. Do you understand? This
[1:27:00] is what this whole thing is all
[1:27:03] about because he wanted you as
[1:27:07] sons and daughters and you were in
[1:27:11] thought form.
[1:27:13] But it's hard to fellowship in thought
[1:27:15] form. That's right. You can't reach up
[1:27:17] in your mind and pull one of them
[1:27:19] thoughts out and kind of lay your
[1:27:21] thought out there in the pull pit, you
[1:27:22] know, on the table and play around. How
[1:27:24] you how you doing, Todd? How you doing?
[1:27:26] Well, I I love you so much and you're my
[1:27:28] little thoughty and I I just love you
[1:27:30] little thought. You can't fellowship
[1:27:32] with a thought. You can't talk to a
[1:27:34] thought. The thought can't answer you
[1:27:36] back. But God wanted to bring it from
[1:27:39] thought form into a manifested word form
[1:27:42] and you bypass your theophony. So you
[1:27:45] come to the earth and then what are you?
[1:27:47] You're a man or a woman. You look like
[1:27:49] everybody everybody else on the earth.
[1:27:50] Born a sinner, born lost. And that's why
[1:27:52] we get that in our mind. Oh, there's no
[1:27:54] hope for me. Oh, there's hope for you
[1:27:56] before the foundation of the world.
[1:27:58] Sure, that's the way we preach the
[1:28:00] gospel and that's it. But remember,
[1:28:02] we're preaching to a bride and we're
[1:28:04] preaching to a church. And to that
[1:28:05] church, it's whosoever will, let him
[1:28:07] come, take of the water of life freely.
[1:28:09] But you were in his mind before there's
[1:28:11] ever one speck of stardust. And their
[1:28:14] names can be taken off of their book,
[1:28:16] but your name can be took off of yours
[1:28:18] because your Hallelujah. Yours is in the
[1:28:21] lamb's book of the life.
[1:28:23] Oh, thank you, Lord. Notice then in son
[1:28:26] form as son of man on the earth. He had
[1:28:29] to be in some form. And when he returned
[1:28:32] on
[1:28:34] Pentecost, he was son of God again.
[1:28:39] See what I
[1:28:40] mean? Get the idea. Some of y'all ain't
[1:28:44] getting the idea. I can see it all over
[1:28:45] your face right now. It's the same God
[1:28:48] all the time. But he had to change his
[1:28:51] form in order to get in people. Don't
[1:28:54] you see? He didn't just want one in the
[1:28:57] family. Well, those of you that had the
[1:28:59] true baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight
[1:29:01] in your soul, what are you? What are
[1:29:03] you? Who are you? Come on. You're living
[1:29:06] on the earth as sons and daughters of
[1:29:09] God that's been redeemed by the blood of
[1:29:11] the lamb. And in your body is deity.
[1:29:15] The baptism of the Holy Ghost. More than
[1:29:18] gifts now, more than emotion. We believe
[1:29:20] in all that. Yes. Thank God. But I'm
[1:29:22] talking about deity. Remember when there
[1:29:25] is no more tongues and there won't be in
[1:29:27] heaven. We won't prophesy in heaven.
[1:29:30] There won't be prayer lines in heaven.
[1:29:32] But your portion of the Holy Ghost will
[1:29:34] be yours for eternity. It's your part of
[1:29:38] the godhead.
[1:29:40] You understand the word Elohim is
[1:29:43] actually plur.
[1:29:45] Now the trinitarians try to say three.
[1:29:48] There's way more than three.
[1:29:51] Amen. When he spoke of that, he was
[1:29:53] speaking of himself in the form of
[1:29:57] plurality, but not two other gods, but
[1:30:00] himself and his children.
[1:30:04] And what are they? They are a part of
[1:30:07] Elohim because they are his children.
[1:30:10] Well, you say that's not fair. Is it
[1:30:11] unfair for you to love your children in
[1:30:13] a different way than you love mine? Do
[1:30:16] you provide for my children the way you
[1:30:18] do for your own? Do you provide for
[1:30:20] children in your community in the same
[1:30:23] way you do your own? Come on now. Answer
[1:30:24] me back. Don't sit there. Look at me. I
[1:30:27] do. Do Do you provide and buy for
[1:30:29] everybody else in your neighborhood the
[1:30:31] way you do for your children? Well, do
[1:30:33] you feel not feel condemned for doing
[1:30:35] that? You buy everybody in your house
[1:30:37] the same day you go to the grocery
[1:30:39] store, pay
[1:30:40] $385 for three bags, and then you say,
[1:30:43] "Glory to God, was able to afford that
[1:30:45] anyway." Hallelujah. And you come back
[1:30:47] and you realize, I'll tell you if
[1:30:49] groceries and everything goes get a
[1:30:50] little bit higher. Our lists are going
[1:30:51] to get smaller and smaller and smaller.
[1:30:53] You got to go to the grocery store about
[1:30:54] something like that. Look, you buy
[1:30:56] everybody in the community the same
[1:30:58] thing. I thought you had love. I thought
[1:31:00] you had compassion and understanding on
[1:31:02] everybody else. Come on. It is not
[1:31:05] wrong. It is not evil for God to love
[1:31:10] his children with a special love. It is
[1:31:14] not sinful for God to care for his own.
[1:31:18] And then he spills over his mercy over
[1:31:20] into the book of life and say, "Hey, if
[1:31:22] you all want to come, y'all come on,
[1:31:24] too. You may not live in the house, but
[1:31:26] y'all come on.
[1:31:28] That's my father."
[1:31:30] Oh, hallelujah. Notice then the mighty
[1:31:32] God unveiled for us. Then we find his
[1:31:35] death, bear, resurrection.
[1:31:39] He
[1:31:41] He came on the day of
[1:31:44] Pentecost as the son of
[1:31:48] God. Now don't misunderstand
[1:31:51] me. This is not what happened on Isuza
[1:31:55] Street.
[1:31:59] The
[1:32:01] person came on the day of
[1:32:03] Pentecost. What they receive on Isuza
[1:32:06] Street. Oh, they got a baptism. It's
[1:32:08] evident it was not the same person that
[1:32:10] came there because they divided, they
[1:32:12] split, they baptized in titles, they
[1:32:13] done this, that and the other. You mean
[1:32:15] the same person and them would tell them
[1:32:17] to baptize in titles and that person was
[1:32:19] in Peter and said, "You got to repent
[1:32:20] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:32:22] Christ." What happened to that person
[1:32:24] then? You understand? Now remember the
[1:32:26] prophet in the early years looked at
[1:32:30] Isuza Street and called it the
[1:32:34] restoration. Why? It looked so close
[1:32:38] that in those early years of his
[1:32:40] ministry, he looked at the Isusa Street
[1:32:43] revival and that move and said, "It's
[1:32:47] the return. It's come back to the earth
[1:32:50] again." Oh. But when that word started
[1:32:53] unfolding and unfolding and he started
[1:32:55] saying, he said, "Oh my Lord, it's not
[1:32:58] the original.
[1:33:00] It was the shock.
[1:33:03] I've been calling I've been calling that
[1:33:05] thing the bride. I've been calling it
[1:33:07] the original. Remember when he started
[1:33:09] to preach the first seal and he said I
[1:33:11] would have made a horrible mistake
[1:33:13] today. Why? Because he was calling that
[1:33:16] white horse rider for years. The Lord
[1:33:18] Jesus. But when the Lord pulled back
[1:33:21] that seal, it wasn't the Lord Jesus at
[1:33:23] all. It was the devil. You imagine how
[1:33:26] that prophet must have felt. I thank God
[1:33:29] for his honesty. Don't you? Amen.
[1:33:32] My notice he came on the day of
[1:33:35] Pentecost as son of God. God the spirit
[1:33:40] in the form Holy Ghost. What was he
[1:33:42] doing? He was changing himself making
[1:33:46] himself known to his people in a
[1:33:49] different form. But remember, he
[1:33:51] promised he'd come back in the form of
[1:33:52] son of man.
[1:33:55] I don't want to shake you too much here
[1:33:57] tonight, but actually the son of man is
[1:33:59] still here.
[1:34:04] I said the son of man is still here. We
[1:34:07] said, "Where is he, brother Donnie?"
[1:34:08] He's actually right here tonight.
[1:34:10] He's in his people.
[1:34:13] He has returned.
[1:34:16] So justification made way for
[1:34:19] sanctification. Sanctification made way
[1:34:22] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:25] Baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for
[1:34:27] the Holy Ghost
[1:34:30] himself, the
[1:34:32] person, the token. You ever wonder why
[1:34:35] Brother Brandham preached the Holy Ghost
[1:34:37] series in
[1:34:39] 1959? Then he comes and preaches the
[1:34:42] token in 1963. He says it's token time
[1:34:46] for
[1:34:47] me for
[1:34:51] you. Now remember he says when he refers
[1:34:54] back to preaching that the
[1:34:57] token he says the whole message coming
[1:35:01] up to that time was pointing right into
[1:35:04] that and he kept emphasizing and why
[1:35:08] people sitting right there in the
[1:35:09] Brandham tabernacle that had the baptism
[1:35:12] of the Holy Ghost on their spirit but
[1:35:14] did not have the token. Why? The token
[1:35:17] is the personal life.
[1:35:20] It is not a gift. It's the giver.
[1:35:25] And Pentecost. Oh, glory to God. Oh,
[1:35:26] hallelujah. I feel it all over me. Sure,
[1:35:28] we'll feel it all over us. But you can
[1:35:30] feel it all over you and still be a
[1:35:32] devil. Remember Elvis Presley had the
[1:35:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:38] And the prophet said you could have the
[1:35:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of
[1:35:41] your life and die lost. But if you ever
[1:35:44] get that person down in your soul, you
[1:35:46] ain't going to die lost.
[1:35:49] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So what's
[1:35:53] he do? He changes his form. Notice he
[1:35:57] said what's he doing? He's changing
[1:35:59] himself. Making himself known to his
[1:36:01] people in a different form like the Holy
[1:36:04] Spirit which is God. He came to deal
[1:36:07] through the church ages as son of God.
[1:36:10] The Holy
[1:36:13] Spirit. So he in the millennium he'll be
[1:36:15] son of David. What is it? same God all
[1:36:18] the time. But remember between there and
[1:36:22] the millennium, he promised to come back
[1:36:25] in the form of son of
[1:36:28] man. What is the son of man? He says he
[1:36:31] asked this in the question, who is this
[1:36:33] son of man? In the beginning was the
[1:36:36] word
[1:36:38] and the word was with God.
[1:36:41] You see, for many around the message,
[1:36:42] they think the achievement is just
[1:36:44] having our books and, you know, just
[1:36:46] listen to tapes and getting the material
[1:36:48] and getting it in our mind. And you
[1:36:50] should do that. If you don't, shame on
[1:36:52] you.
[1:36:53] But it's not just getting the substance
[1:36:56] of the message in your head,
[1:36:58] but getting that person of the Lord
[1:37:01] Jesus so in your soul that he captures
[1:37:05] you and you become a prisoner of his own
[1:37:10] presence and his own will living out of
[1:37:13] you. Amen. as I mentioned it there in
[1:37:17] Switzerland that there are uh sisters
[1:37:21] and young people and teenagers that God
[1:37:25] will use to express himself out of them
[1:37:28] in a way that a preacher can never touch
[1:37:32] it because God has different parts of
[1:37:36] his word. So he may allow a a young
[1:37:39] sister and she goes to school and she's
[1:37:42] laughed at and ridiculed and made fun of
[1:37:44] or maybe a brother and he would go
[1:37:46] through something for the cause of the
[1:37:48] Lord Jesus that a preacher would never
[1:37:51] have to go through and the same way
[1:37:52] around the other way. There may be
[1:37:54] things that a preacher would have to go
[1:37:55] through but God has allocated certain
[1:37:58] parts of his word for each of us in our
[1:38:02] life and nobody else can take your
[1:38:04] place. So if God called you and put you
[1:38:06] in a bed to be a businessman and you're
[1:38:08] to be in contact with this person and
[1:38:10] that person and another person and then
[1:38:13] you'll be able to let your light shine
[1:38:15] before men to people that I will never
[1:38:18] see. There was people out near the place
[1:38:21] where we were having the meeting there
[1:38:22] in a convention center type thing in a
[1:38:25] hotel. They was just out walking their
[1:38:27] dog, man and a woman. She had cut hair,
[1:38:29] had on pants, had on jewelry, this that
[1:38:31] and the other. And some of the saints
[1:38:32] was out just taking a walk in the Swiss
[1:38:34] Alps. Beautiful. Out just deciding to
[1:38:37] take a walk. Said, "Well, what are you
[1:38:38] doing?" "Oh, we're up here for a
[1:38:39] meeting." "Oh, oh, it's a meeting. Yeah,
[1:38:41] what kind of meeting?" "Well, it's a
[1:38:42] Bible meeting." "Oh, well, we're
[1:38:43] Christians." So, you know what? They
[1:38:45] come up there. First service, Carol,
[1:38:46] second service, something like that.
[1:38:48] They couldn't believe it. The things
[1:38:50] they were hearing, they said, "My Lord,
[1:38:51] we never heard nothing about this in our
[1:38:53] life." So, they were staying at the
[1:38:55] hotel. Guess what? They brought Poochie
[1:38:57] to church with them. Them and Poochie
[1:38:59] sat on the outside. At least they didn't
[1:39:00] bring him in the church. He might have
[1:39:01] been more reverend, you know, who knows?
[1:39:03] But they brought him and they showed up
[1:39:05] there every service thereafter. They
[1:39:08] wanted the preachers to pray for him.
[1:39:10] Had all kinds of questions. Who knows?
[1:39:12] It might have been the last two before
[1:39:14] the
[1:39:17] rapture. Hallelujah. It wasn't because I
[1:39:20] was out there walking. Glory to God. I
[1:39:22] took my iPads, all three of them. I took
[1:39:25] my laptop. I took this out, the other.
[1:39:27] It was just a saint of God walking up
[1:39:30] and down the don't get in your mind that
[1:39:32] the only light that will shine in this
[1:39:35] day is the preacher and the deacon and
[1:39:37] the trustee. But let your light shine
[1:39:40] before men that they may see your good
[1:39:43] works and glorify your father which is
[1:39:45] in heaven.
[1:39:48] What is it? The same God that can live
[1:39:51] in the housewife.
[1:39:53] It's the same God that lives in the
[1:39:56] preacher. The same God that lived in the
[1:39:59] prophet. Brother Tom Ray is giving a
[1:40:01] testimony about a sister in their church
[1:40:03] going down the road, driving down the
[1:40:04] interstate and oh my, this main artery
[1:40:08] deal right here in her chest split wide
[1:40:10] open just unraveled. Brother Keith right
[1:40:13] inside of her body. And they they called
[1:40:15] 911. Let's pick them up immediately.
[1:40:17] They take her eight hour surgery,
[1:40:18] another eight hour surgery, another
[1:40:20] six-hour surgery. And they were
[1:40:22] proclaiming an example of the tape there
[1:40:24] of the service. And a nurse come in and
[1:40:26] said, "What is that language?" And it
[1:40:29] was a a tape that they were showing a
[1:40:31] demonstration there at Cloverdale. And
[1:40:33] it was showing them how that they do it.
[1:40:34] And it was some language. Was it turkey
[1:40:36] carol? Something like that. And that
[1:40:38] woman walked in and said, "Well, that
[1:40:40] language who who's saying that?" And
[1:40:42] that sister just come out of this major
[1:40:44] major surgeon said, "What are you
[1:40:46] talking about? This is a service from
[1:40:48] our church." She said, "Why?" She said,
[1:40:50] "That's my language. That's the language
[1:40:52] I speak. That's the language I was born
[1:40:55] in." I wonder, sometimes we think
[1:40:58] horrible things happen to us as children
[1:41:00] of God. But I wonder, I read it to them
[1:41:03] over there in Switzerland the other day
[1:41:04] that Brother Brandham said, "Sickness is
[1:41:07] not always a curse. Sometimes it's a
[1:41:10] blessing that God's got something he
[1:41:12] wants to do." I believe if we could
[1:41:15] realize the steps of the righteous are
[1:41:18] ordered by the Lord and we think, well,
[1:41:20] all blessings and all goodness and all
[1:41:22] peace. But what if he lets you get down
[1:41:24] sometime so you can be able to
[1:41:27] understand a little more how much he
[1:41:29] loves you? What if he lets you get sick,
[1:41:31] puts you in a doctor's office, let
[1:41:33] somebody see you, let somebody feel the
[1:41:35] presence of God, then you have witnessed
[1:41:38] the power of the resurrected Savior.
[1:41:43] Oh, thank you,
[1:41:47] Lord. Notice he says he came to deal
[1:41:50] through the church
[1:41:52] ages as son of God, the Holy Spirit.
[1:41:57] I hope I don't confuse you with this,
[1:41:59] but there has to be a change before the
[1:42:03] rapture where it's not just son of
[1:42:09] God, but son of
[1:42:14] man. For you see, Abraham saw a brief
[1:42:19] appearance, the son of
[1:42:23] man before the body changer.
[1:42:27] It's
[1:42:28] evident people could have the son of god
[1:42:31] baptism for 2,000
[1:42:35] years and not produce a
[1:42:39] rapture. So if we don't have no more
[1:42:43] than what isa
[1:42:45] had to be the bearer of bad news but you
[1:42:48] won't have a rapture either.
[1:42:51] Nor will I
[1:42:53] nor will anybody else. Amen. Unless of
[1:42:57] course he changes his form.
[1:43:01] Why does he change
[1:43:03] forms? So he can change yours.
[1:43:07] Why did he come from his god form to
[1:43:10] becoming the son form to redeem you? Why
[1:43:14] does he change forms? It's all about the
[1:43:17] dispensational truths that he
[1:43:20] releases. Oh, hallelujah. And I woke up
[1:43:23] before daylight a few mornings ago
[1:43:25] laying there in the room. Carol laying
[1:43:27] there sleeping. I didn't want to get up
[1:43:28] and and bother her. Oh, but just for a
[1:43:31] little bit, it was pouring like the
[1:43:34] streams coming out of heaven. And he was
[1:43:36] just dealing with me and dealing with me
[1:43:38] about when God changes
[1:43:41] dispensationally that he will also
[1:43:43] change nature to coincide. And I begin
[1:43:46] to think as he begin to change
[1:43:48] dispensationally from in the beginning
[1:43:50] God created the heavens and the earth.
[1:43:52] Then he goes into the form of the Lord
[1:43:55] God which is God with his family. When
[1:43:58] he moves into that he begins to deal
[1:44:00] with what? Nature. So he changes nature,
[1:44:04] brings it from the lower forms of life
[1:44:06] and goes to creating higher higher
[1:44:09] higher changing of the nature
[1:44:12] identifying a dispensational change.
[1:44:15] Then a thought about Noah as God was
[1:44:17] revealing his word and grace in that
[1:44:19] day. And Noah found grace in the eyes of
[1:44:23] the Lord, a change of the dispensation.
[1:44:26] And what happened? Nature went right
[1:44:29] along with the chain. As I land there
[1:44:30] just for a few minutes, the Lord just
[1:44:32] started opening all that up and I
[1:44:33] thought, "Oh my goodness, here we are
[1:44:36] changing of dispensations again." And
[1:44:39] what's it going to bring? A change of
[1:44:42] nature. Watch when the rapture takes
[1:44:45] place and the world goes into the
[1:44:47] tribulation period, what is it? Changing
[1:44:50] of a dispensation, a changing of nature.
[1:44:54] Oh my, aren't you grateful? Then watch
[1:44:57] when God changes you
[1:45:01] dispensationally. Oh, I hope you hear
[1:45:03] me. Don't you understand? God did not
[1:45:06] change your
[1:45:07] seed. God changed you
[1:45:12] dispensationally. And what happened with
[1:45:15] you? Nature changed with it.
[1:45:20] You always was a seed.
[1:45:23] You didn't become it. ing some of you
[1:45:25] are still thinking that in your mind.
[1:45:27] I'm asking you tonight, Rebecca, who are
[1:45:30] you?
[1:45:34] You always was
[1:45:37] a
[1:45:38] son or daughter of God. Amen.
[1:45:43] Who did the Holy Ghost fall on on the
[1:45:45] day of Pentecost? Sons.
[1:45:49] It didn't fall on them to make them
[1:45:50] sons. It fell on them because they were
[1:45:52] sons.
[1:45:54] Amen.
[1:45:56] Notice again you read this Hebrews 21.
[1:45:58] For both he that sanctifith, and they
[1:46:00] were sanctified or all of what? For
[1:46:03] which cause he is not ashamed to call
[1:46:07] them brethren, saying, I will declare
[1:46:10] thy
[1:46:11] name? Unto my brethren in the midst of
[1:46:15] the
[1:46:17] church. You see, God goes to
[1:46:20] church. Amen.
[1:46:23] Thomas missed one service. This is one
[1:46:25] of the greatest church service he ever
[1:46:26] missed in his life. Jesus showed up. A
[1:46:28] resurrected body
[1:46:30] saying, "I will declare thy name unto my
[1:46:33] brethren. In the midst of the church
[1:46:36] will I sing
[1:46:38] praise unto thee." Now you realize,
[1:46:40] probably some of you Bible readers do,
[1:46:43] that Paul is quoting
[1:46:46] Psalm
[1:46:49] 22, verse 22. I will declare thy name
[1:46:54] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[1:46:57] congregation will I praise thee. But
[1:47:00] there's a great mystery that lays here
[1:47:04] in the
[1:47:06] title of Psalm 22 verse one. Now if your
[1:47:10] Bible has the titles of the Psalms,
[1:47:12] you'll be able to read it here in your
[1:47:14] Bible. But let me just share it with
[1:47:15] you. To the chief
[1:47:19] musician upon Al
[1:47:22] Jalis Shahar.
[1:47:25] Al
[1:47:27] Jalis
[1:47:29] Shahar, a psalm of David. My
[1:47:34] God. My
[1:47:37] God. So people
[1:47:41] rejoice because of Psalm 23 and oh how
[1:47:44] they love
[1:47:46] it. But before there could be a Psalm
[1:47:49] 23, there had to be a Psalm 22 which was
[1:47:53] the deaths of the shepherd.
[1:47:56] In order to get the blessing of the
[1:47:58] shepherd's life in Psalm 23, there had
[1:48:02] to be a death of the shepherd in Psalm
[1:48:05] 22. I want you to listen how prophetic
[1:48:08] God's word is. So Psalm 21 is a psalm 22
[1:48:12] rather of Christ suffering entitled a
[1:48:18] shahar. This is what it means in the
[1:48:21] Hebrew, the morning stag.
[1:48:25] the morning
[1:48:27] stag. Such a one as the
[1:48:31] huntman singles
[1:48:34] out to
[1:48:36] hunt for that
[1:48:39] day. Now you imagine when them people
[1:48:42] read that psalm in the day in the days
[1:48:44] of David and they thought, "What in the
[1:48:46] world's the matter with him?"
[1:48:48] He entitled this psalm about a stag, a
[1:48:52] deer or elk, whatever you want to call
[1:48:54] it to where you can relate to it. And
[1:48:55] and he he calls this the elk for the
[1:48:59] day. The deer for the day. And they
[1:49:01] thought, what in the world is the matter
[1:49:03] with David and then he starts out, "My
[1:49:05] God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[1:49:08] All thy bones, they stare at me. They
[1:49:10] pierce my hands and my feet. They gap
[1:49:13] upon me. The bulls of Bashan and he goes
[1:49:15] on and on." And the people must have
[1:49:17] thought, "What in the world's the matter
[1:49:18] with him? There ain't nobody nashing on
[1:49:21] him. There ain't nobody." But the spirit
[1:49:24] of God prophetically had got a hold to
[1:49:27] David and he entered into such passion.
[1:49:31] It was as if though it was him being
[1:49:33] crucified.
[1:49:37] You imagine when the devil looked at
[1:49:39] that and he
[1:49:40] said, "What in the world?"
[1:49:44] the stag that is singled out to hunt for
[1:49:48] that day. What is it? The
[1:49:52] sacrifice for that day on Calvary. And
[1:49:55] God hid the mystery of Christ where the
[1:49:58] most inconspicuous of all places, the
[1:50:03] title. That's why I love
[1:50:08] titles. Christ is the mystery of God
[1:50:11] revealed.
[1:50:15] The rapture, the sudden secret going
[1:50:18] away of the church, adoption, Holy Ghost
[1:50:22] series, who is God, attitude toward God.
[1:50:26] Well, come on, somebody. Amen. Angel of
[1:50:29] God. Don't you love titles when they're
[1:50:31] really God-chosen titles? And whatever
[1:50:34] he displays, so in Psalm 22, the good
[1:50:38] shepherd gives his life for the sheep.
[1:50:41] In Psalm 23, he's enters into the in the
[1:50:44] position. So he's now raised from the
[1:50:47] dead in Psalm 23 to know the tender care
[1:50:53] of his sheep. But he had to enter into
[1:50:55] Psalm 22 before it. In Psalm 24, he's
[1:50:59] the chief shepherd that appears as the
[1:51:02] king of glory. Who is this king of
[1:51:06] glory? The Lord of hosts mighty in
[1:51:08] battles. 22, 23, 24. And then we had a
[1:51:13] prophet in this day that said he was
[1:51:15] going to preach on the rapture. He does
[1:51:18] not go to what would be apparent sermon
[1:51:20] titles that you'd go 1 Corinthians 15, 1
[1:51:24] Thessalonians 4:16, Matthew 24, but he
[1:51:28] goes to Psalm 27 and said, I'd like to
[1:51:32] read for a background.
[1:51:36] The Lord is my light and the strength of
[1:51:40] my life.
[1:51:42] You're going to read that for the
[1:51:44] background of the rapture. What does the
[1:51:47] word background mean? Circumstances and
[1:51:51] events that are taking place or
[1:51:54] transpiring at a certain time. The Lord
[1:51:57] is my light and the strength of my life.
[1:52:00] Of whom shall I be afraid? Of whom shall
[1:52:03] I fear? Sounds like Leodosa to me. Don't
[1:52:06] you understand what God does? Well, you
[1:52:09] can identify him in Psalm 22. Can't you
[1:52:12] can you identify yourself in Psalm 23? I
[1:52:16] was driving down the road the other day
[1:52:17] going down to to speak Sister Carol and
[1:52:19] Butcher's funeral. I didn't have a clue
[1:52:21] which direction I was going to go. Me
[1:52:23] and Carol was coming across the
[1:52:25] Cumberland Plateau coming between
[1:52:27] Crossful and and Cookville just talking
[1:52:29] a little bit. We got a little bit
[1:52:30] silent. While I was the spirit of God
[1:52:32] come into the car and he started
[1:52:34] speaking to me and he told me to go this
[1:52:36] way and to preach Psalm 23 but to insert
[1:52:40] Sister Carolyn's name. So when I got up
[1:52:43] and I said the Lord was Sister Carolyn's
[1:52:45] shepherd and Sister Carolyn didn't want.
[1:52:48] He led Sister Carolyn beside the still
[1:52:51] waters. He led her here and he done
[1:52:53] that. I'll tell you one thing, I bet had
[1:52:56] me a Holy Ghost spell. And there was all
[1:52:58] kinds of folks in there by the Helen
[1:53:00] said they're still requesting that
[1:53:02] sermon. Did anybody record it? Did
[1:53:04] anybody record it? People think we're
[1:53:06] weird and they think we're strange, but
[1:53:09] when they come to hear our funerals,
[1:53:10] they say it over and over again. I ain't
[1:53:13] never heard a funeral like that in my
[1:53:15] life. That's the kind of church I want
[1:53:17] to go to. I don't want a regular
[1:53:19] funeral. I don't want what everybody
[1:53:21] else has got. I want a funeral that
[1:53:24] matches my life. I want a gospel that
[1:53:28] matches who we are.
[1:53:34] Folks from the home of brother Allen and
[1:53:36] Sister Carolyn come. He said, "Brother
[1:53:38] Donnie, it's been the talk of that old
[1:53:40] folks home for for several days now.
[1:53:42] They ain't never heard nothing like
[1:53:43] their life." Well, that's exactly the
[1:53:45] way it ought to be because we live that
[1:53:48] kind of a lie. We're not who everybody
[1:53:50] else is. And we say that by the grace of
[1:53:53] God. But the stag was hunted that day.
[1:53:56] What day you talking about? That day on
[1:53:58] Calvary. That day on Calvary. That stag
[1:54:02] was hunted so that I could be free. He
[1:54:04] could not do it in his God form. But he
[1:54:07] done it in his son form. And he said,
[1:54:09] "Now you're my thought form, but become
[1:54:12] my sons and my daughters."
[1:54:17] Hallelujah.
[1:54:23] Listen to this in Hebrews and we'll
[1:54:26] close. Man always fear death.
[1:54:32] Christ became
[1:54:35] sin, made
[1:54:37] low to take death upon himself.
[1:54:41] And he's not ashamed to be
[1:54:44] called our brother.
[1:54:49] I've read several different commentaries
[1:54:51] from different preachers down through
[1:54:52] the ages 1600s 1700s 1800s and whenever
[1:54:56] they poor old guys whenever they go
[1:54:59] through this about Hebrews said it's
[1:55:01] blasphemy absent blasphemy if anybody
[1:55:04] will try to bring Jesus that place of
[1:55:05] Jesus our brother I think you
[1:55:07] knuckleheads he said it himself but you
[1:55:10] say it wasn't given to their age
[1:55:14] you say brother Donnie why is it so
[1:55:16] important
[1:55:17] He has to come down in order to lift you
[1:55:20] up.
[1:55:23] As long as you keep keep this
[1:55:25] magnanimous gap between you and him.
[1:55:29] I preached it to you over 25 years
[1:55:33] ago that there's not that much
[1:55:37] difference between you and him.
[1:55:41] It's a whole lot closer
[1:55:44] than what you realize.
[1:55:52] I feel like speaking French right
[1:55:54] now or German or
[1:55:57] something. Oh,
[1:56:01] hallelujah. He's not ashamed to be
[1:56:04] called our brother far.
[1:56:08] He was tempted just like we are
[1:56:12] tempted to be the right kind of
[1:56:14] intercessor because he stood the same
[1:56:17] kind of
[1:56:18] temptation that you stand.
[1:56:21] He took your place knowing that you
[1:56:24] couldn't take it yourself.
[1:56:28] Christ became
[1:56:31] sin that you might become righteous.
[1:56:37] He's the right kind of a chief captain
[1:56:39] for our
[1:56:40] salvation because he suffered just like
[1:56:43] we
[1:56:43] suffered. He's been tempted just like
[1:56:46] we're tempted. And he's not
[1:56:49] ashamed to be called our
[1:56:52] brother. Believe it or not, this will be
[1:56:55] close to the last
[1:56:57] step for some of you.
[1:57:01] years
[1:57:03] ago, some of you finally got to a
[1:57:06] place you could accept him as your
[1:57:10] savior. You still toyed with the idea,
[1:57:12] I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy. I'm not
[1:57:14] worthy. So, you sort of accepted him as
[1:57:16] your
[1:57:17] savior. Then you moved on a little bit
[1:57:19] and accepted him as this and that and
[1:57:21] the
[1:57:22] other. But
[1:57:24] this will be one of the last
[1:57:29] steps. Oh, he's your great God. He's
[1:57:32] mighty. Yeah. Yeah. You see what we're
[1:57:35] doing? Lift him way up. Put him way up.
[1:57:38] Way up. Way up. Way up. Way beyond our
[1:57:40] reach. Way beyond our
[1:57:45] sinking. But before you'll get way up
[1:57:48] with him, you got to bring him down to
[1:57:50] where he was. And where he is.
[1:57:54] God's prophet said, "It ain't no wonder
[1:57:56] Satan hates this message. It brings
[1:57:59] Jesus to a place no other preacher ever
[1:58:02] preached him.
[1:58:07] Hallelujah.
[1:58:13] Hallelujah. The prophet said he suffered
[1:58:18] sexual temptation.
[1:58:23] Suffered sexual temptation. Notice right
[1:58:27] here, he says he suffered just like we
[1:58:29] suffered. He's been tempted like you've
[1:58:30] been
[1:58:31] tempted. And he's not ashamed to be
[1:58:34] called our brother because he knows what
[1:58:35] we go through. Oh, blessed be his name.
[1:58:38] For verily took not on him the form of
[1:58:41] angels, but he took on him the seed of
[1:58:42] Abraham. Look, temptation was for him.
[1:58:46] You know that the Bible said he was
[1:58:49] tempted in all points like as we are,
[1:58:51] yet without
[1:58:54] sin. Does anybody believe these next
[1:58:57] words?
[1:59:00] He was
[1:59:02] tempted by
[1:59:09] drinking. I've got to be honest with
[1:59:12] you. I've never been tempted by
[1:59:17] drinking. No, I haven't. There's lots of
[1:59:20] things I've never been tempted by. I've
[1:59:22] just It just It's just never bothered
[1:59:24] me. I've never been tempted by
[1:59:26] it. I'm so glad I'm not the example.
[1:59:31] But Jesus knew he'd have some sons and
[1:59:35] some
[1:59:37] daughters that once that alcohol hit
[1:59:40] their brain and brought them to that
[1:59:43] ecstatic
[1:59:44] place, their mind would
[1:59:48] crave to be there again.
[1:59:51] They would thirst to get back to that
[1:59:54] part. It would alter their brain. It
[1:59:59] would change
[2:00:00] them. For a drug addict that would ever
[2:00:03] reach that place with estasier, you
[2:00:05] know, cocaine or whatever would be and
[2:00:07] would release the those endorphins
[2:00:09] inside the body that produced that
[2:00:12] feelgood
[2:00:13] feeling. And the body loved that
[2:00:16] feeling. And the body said, "I want to
[2:00:18] feel it again.
[2:00:19] I want to feed it again. And they
[2:00:22] hunger, they thirst, they'll sell their
[2:00:24] shoes. They'll sell their babies nearly.
[2:00:28] They'll sell their body
[2:00:30] to feel that way again.
[2:00:34] And turn down the very person that can
[2:00:38] make you feel greater than alcohol or
[2:00:41] drugs or anything else can ever make you
[2:00:44] feel.
[2:00:47] You've heard brother Daryl talk about
[2:00:50] excuse me that little sister up in the
[2:00:52] Eskimo village just a young woman
[2:00:58] alcoholic aa time after time
[2:01:03] again no
[2:01:05] hope but Daryl up there in the
[2:01:08] meeting God delivered her
[2:01:12] several years
[2:01:14] ago excuse
[2:01:16] He still hears from her. He said,
[2:01:18] "Brother Daryl, I'm still sober."
[2:01:23] So Jesus fought
[2:01:27] drinking. He didn't drink
[2:01:30] now, but he fought
[2:01:33] that. Imagine him walking by the wine
[2:01:37] dispensaries in that day. And the devil
[2:01:38] said, "You know that would help
[2:01:41] you. We lift this burden for a while.
[2:01:46] It will numb your mind and he'll help
[2:01:50] you. Jesus is a
[2:01:56] man. Probably
[2:01:58] would probably help me a little bit. But
[2:02:02] it's a
[2:02:03] Satan get behind me.
[2:02:09] He was tempted by women.
[2:02:14] He was tempted by everything that could
[2:02:16] be tempted by. He was tempted by
[2:02:18] everything we are.
[2:02:21] He was a
[2:02:24] man. And
[2:02:25] yet you couldn't put a mark on him.
[2:02:32] Praise God. That's who represents me.
[2:02:37] That's who represents you.
[2:02:40] Jesus was completely totally man. He
[2:02:44] could cry like a man. He could eat like
[2:02:47] a man. He could become like a man. He
[2:02:50] was completely totally man in his
[2:02:53] physical being and in his spirit
[2:02:56] completely totally
[2:02:59] God. So he made his flesh
[2:03:03] submissive to the spirit. that was said.
[2:03:06] Don't you understand? The first one to
[2:03:10] live an overcoming New Testament life.
[2:03:15] Praise God. I'm going to say it again.
[2:03:17] The first one to live an overcoming New
[2:03:21] Testament life. Nobody in the Old
[2:03:23] Testament could do that. The spirit of
[2:03:25] God come on him and left him. Come on
[2:03:26] him and left him. But it come inside of
[2:03:29] him and it helped him to bring his flesh
[2:03:32] subject to that spirit. And he overcome
[2:03:35] every one of these temptations. How? As
[2:03:37] a son of God, as a great Elohim, as a
[2:03:40] man filled with the Holy Ghost. Which
[2:03:43] leaves every one of us sitting here
[2:03:44] tonight without excuse. If you want to
[2:03:47] overcome or you say, "That devil made me
[2:03:49] do it." Come on. Just face the facts.
[2:03:51] The devil didn't make you do it. You
[2:03:52] just didn't want to do it bad enough.
[2:03:54] You didn't want to just say, "Get away
[2:03:56] from me, devil.
[2:04:00] Listen." He was tempted in all manner as
[2:04:03] we are. He was man, not an angel. He was
[2:04:07] a man. He had
[2:04:10] desires and
[2:04:12] temptations just like would you? The
[2:04:14] Bible said he was a man, not an angel
[2:04:16] above temptation. Hebrews 1:4 said he
[2:04:18] was made lower. Can you
[2:04:21] imagine? Made lower than the
[2:04:24] angels. Completely man. That God took a
[2:04:29] complete man. I love this statement,
[2:04:31] brother friend. God took a complete
[2:04:34] man to bring a total
[2:04:37] deliverance. God didn't take a
[2:04:40] God, but God took a completely
[2:04:44] surrendered man.
[2:04:47] Oh, hallelujah, children. Don't you
[2:04:50] understand? That's what he's wanting
[2:04:52] tonight. Sons and daughters of God that
[2:04:56] are completely surrendered.
[2:04:59] Brother Wayne preached the first service
[2:05:01] over in
[2:05:02] Switzerland. He sent the brothers his
[2:05:04] scriptures and quotes and things like
[2:05:06] that the direction he was going to go. A
[2:05:09] few of us ministers is back in a little
[2:05:11] room on the side. He walked in a few
[2:05:14] minutes after the service started. He
[2:05:16] told brother David Mayer, he said, "I'm
[2:05:19] sorry. I have to change my sermon." He
[2:05:22] said, "I walked out of the room
[2:05:23] apparently. I thought thought something
[2:05:25] ain't right. Something something just
[2:05:26] ain't right. I I just can't preach this.
[2:05:29] Brother David said, "No problem. No
[2:05:31] problem." So they get back there and
[2:05:32] they're writing the scriptures down,
[2:05:33] trying to write the quotes down. Write
[2:05:34] all that down. When Brother Wayne got up
[2:05:37] and started preaching, and I thought,
[2:05:40] "My my bless his heart, Lord." Cuz it
[2:05:44] was not the type of sermon that you'd
[2:05:47] want to open up such a convention with.
[2:05:50] People going to church, honoring
[2:05:52] pastors, honoring gifts. I mean, just,
[2:05:54] you know, you're wanting one of them rip
[2:05:56] tearing. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Third
[2:05:59] pull theophony. All times of thing. I
[2:06:02] told him several times after meeting, I
[2:06:03] said, "Buddy, thank you for following
[2:06:06] the spirit of God cuz I know you well
[2:06:08] enough to know that's not the type of
[2:06:10] sermon you'd like to preach." You see
[2:06:13] what it is? God's doing the same thing
[2:06:16] in human beings that he done in him in
[2:06:19] his own son on the earth.
[2:06:23] So when it comes my time to preach, I'm
[2:06:25] pulling back and forth between this
[2:06:27] direction, that direction. I I I went a
[2:06:29] certain way. I thought, "Okay, y'all
[2:06:30] this this right here." I looked I told
[2:06:32] Carol, she said, "You know what you're
[2:06:34] going to go?" I don't have a clue.
[2:06:36] That's the day I'm going to preach. I
[2:06:38] said, "I've looked at about 60some
[2:06:40] different sermons. I don't have a clue
[2:06:41] what I'm going to say."
[2:06:45] Oh
[2:06:47] my. But later in the evening, I was
[2:06:49] sitting there on the bed and the spirit
[2:06:51] of God just spoke to me. Look right
[2:06:54] here. So I looked this certain certain
[2:06:57] place. There it was. Letter's about that
[2:07:00] big. Or at least that's what how big it
[2:07:02] looked to me. It was about that big in
[2:07:04] reality. So I preached on facts versus
[2:07:09] truth.
[2:07:11] Person after person after person come to
[2:07:15] me. Even those that couldn't even speak
[2:07:16] my language and get an interpreter and
[2:07:18] say, "Tell him, you know, tell him this.
[2:07:21] My life is changed forever. I'll never
[2:07:24] be the same."
[2:07:26] Don't you see why he wants people doing
[2:07:28] the same thing that we ourselves saying,
[2:07:31] "Oh my, oh, you know what? Let us let's
[2:07:34] go this way." But something won't let
[2:07:35] us. We say, "No, I I can't I can't go
[2:07:38] this way." You understand what it is?
[2:07:40] It's Jesus all over again. Yes, sir.
[2:07:44] and brought
[2:07:47] forth Jesus all over
[2:07:51] again. Let me just share a little
[2:07:53] something with you. Whenever we were
[2:07:55] building our place
[2:07:57] here, I'd put back quite a bit of money
[2:07:59] for
[2:08:00] us. So, I had enough money put back to
[2:08:02] build the gym over
[2:08:04] here and the Sunday school
[2:08:07] rooms. Was going to have to make a
[2:08:08] decision if we're going to build this
[2:08:10] right here.
[2:08:11] I said, 'Oh Lord, I I don't want to
[2:08:14] borrow no money. Oh, man. I don't want
[2:08:17] to borrow no money. That builder kept
[2:08:19] pressing me. You going have to make up
[2:08:20] your mind. Going have to make up your
[2:08:21] mind. I don't know. I know. I
[2:08:24] know. The bank want all kind of
[2:08:26] information. Poor brother Jim Bab, bless
[2:08:28] his heart, he'll have a great reward in
[2:08:29] heaven just for putting up with them
[2:08:30] bankers. Oh, they put him through. They
[2:08:33] want to know how old you all were, how
[2:08:34] many of you paid tithe, how many old old
[2:08:37] people we had in the church. afraid
[2:08:39] y'all going to die off. I reckon it was
[2:08:41] the office mess ever was that they put
[2:08:43] him put him through. And whenever we
[2:08:45] owed to bar whatever it was, we wind up
[2:08:48] baring 1.6 1.7 million whatever it was.
[2:08:51] I was sweating
[2:08:55] bullets and I come that
[2:08:58] close to not building
[2:09:02] it. I thought, well, I can't stand to
[2:09:06] put the church in that kind of debt.
[2:09:08] So we'll just we'll have it over there
[2:09:10] in that
[2:09:12] building. So in other words, we'll
[2:09:14] preach on Sunday morning, play
[2:09:16] basketball on Sunday
[2:09:18] afternoon. And I thought is, well, let
[2:09:21] me just go and tell you what I thought.
[2:09:23] I thought as legal as some of Word of
[2:09:25] Life Church is, if they do that, they'll
[2:09:26] quit. They won't even come
[2:09:31] back. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about
[2:09:33] it
[2:09:35] myself. and it come right down to the
[2:09:39] wire. I had to make a decision. I just
[2:09:42] kept saying, "Lord, speak to me. Please
[2:09:44] speak to me. Please tell me. Please
[2:09:48] tell."
[2:09:50] Hallelujah. And when I look today
[2:09:53] backwards and see how close I come to
[2:09:57] missing God's will for our church, it
[2:10:01] scares me to death.
[2:10:08] So, I didn't feel a whirlwind, no
[2:10:11] thunder, no
[2:10:13] lightning. All it was was just a little
[2:10:16] tiny nudge in my
[2:10:19] heart. Go
[2:10:21] ahead. I said, "All right, let's go for
[2:10:25] it." I said, "Did I say that?"
[2:10:31] But I ask
[2:10:33] you, can you
[2:10:35] imagine us tearing down this building
[2:10:38] now? We don't have this building at all.
[2:10:40] And as brother Michael and everybody's
[2:10:42] laying it out, we're just going to make
[2:10:42] more parking lot out of this. Right,
[2:10:44] brother
[2:10:45] Michael? Can you imagine us having
[2:10:47] church over there
[2:10:50] tonight? Our banquetss, our youth
[2:10:54] services. This is what the Lord wanted
[2:10:56] to give
[2:10:57] us. And I
[2:11:00] almost
[2:11:02] settled for
[2:11:09] that. Now I ask
[2:11:11] you, what have you settled
[2:11:14] for that he wants to give you so much
[2:11:18] more? And you just say, "No, no, no, no,
[2:11:21] no, no." You know, and if that's asking
[2:11:25] too much, Lord, I'll even sure it gets
[2:11:26] more. I mean, I I don't want to bankrupt
[2:11:29] you, Lord. Don't worry, you
[2:11:33] won't. This is his blessing
[2:11:38] back for
[2:11:41] millions, listen to me, of
[2:11:44] dollars that have been sown around the
[2:11:48] world for his bride. Of all colors, of
[2:11:52] all
[2:11:53] tongues, of all nationalities.
[2:11:57] And God said, "I want to bless you all,
[2:12:02] and I just about got in the way of your
[2:12:07] blessing. Aren't you glad I can be led
[2:12:09] by the spirit of
[2:12:15] God?" So, what about you?
[2:12:18] Have you come that close? Or have you
[2:12:20] come even closer and knocked God off
[2:12:24] from giving you what he wants you to
[2:12:27] have? Oh
[2:12:33] my. You know, jealousy is a cruel
[2:12:38] thing. And I'm going to be honest with
[2:12:40] you tonight and open up an element about
[2:12:42] myself that I've I share with very very
[2:12:44] few people.
[2:12:46] I've asked God in the past, please stop
[2:12:50] blessing
[2:12:53] me,
[2:12:56] please don't give me more understanding
[2:12:58] of your word. Please just let there be a
[2:13:02] catch-up. Just just quit. Just don't.
[2:13:05] It's causing too much
[2:13:07] trouble. People think it's such a great
[2:13:10] thing when God blesses you. There is
[2:13:13] such a cost.
[2:13:17] But guess what? I ain't said that in a
[2:13:20] long time. And I have no plans from this
[2:13:24] time on ever saying it
[2:13:28] again. I'm sick of
[2:13:32] it. I'm sick of being what people want
[2:13:37] us to be.
[2:13:41] So I say, "Pour it out, Lord.
[2:13:46] [Applause]
[2:13:50] Hallelujah. He wants to bless me with
[2:13:53] revelation. Do it. He wants to bless our
[2:13:56] church. Do it. He wants to bless my
[2:13:59] life, your life, do it, Lord. People's
[2:14:03] going to be jealous. They're going to
[2:14:04] talk about you. They're going to run you
[2:14:05] down anyway. I figure they don't need
[2:14:07] displeasing both God and them. So, I
[2:14:09] choose to displease them. Just let God
[2:14:12] do whatever he wants to do with our
[2:14:13] life. Use us, Lord. And the church said,
[2:14:18] "Do you want to see who you are, or are
[2:14:20] you afraid?" Well, what will people say?
[2:14:22] How much were held back by that? I know
[2:14:26] I've been held back by it,
[2:14:28] too. And I'm sick of it.
[2:14:34] Finally, I can say it with all of my
[2:14:38] soul. I want to be what my
[2:14:43] God wants me to be.
[2:14:50] Little or
[2:14:51] small, it matters not at
[2:14:55] all. If I can bring him
[2:14:58] glory despite the pain, despite the
[2:15:02] shame, if I can bring honor to his
[2:15:05] blessed name.
[2:15:07] For this cause I was chosen. For this
[2:15:11] cause I will be true. For this purpose I
[2:15:14] was
[2:15:15] ordained. And if your
[2:15:17] bride, so are
[2:15:20] you. So don't let people stop you or
[2:15:23] slow you down. Let God's peace and God's
[2:15:28] blessing be all around. For one day his
[2:15:33] shakina will change your mortality.
[2:15:37] in the image of the
[2:15:39] Almighty. For with him will be for
[2:15:46] eternity.
[2:15:48] Hallelujah.
[2:15:52] Hallelujah. Let's pray together.
[2:16:01] My Lord
[2:16:04] Jesus, I thank you that your
[2:16:08] grace overrode my fears. My
[2:16:14] father, you know how many prayers I
[2:16:17] prayed over this
[2:16:20] move? Preachers were saying that we
[2:16:23] would lose half our church and there'd
[2:16:25] be this split and that split. Of course,
[2:16:28] they were waiting for that half to come
[2:16:30] their
[2:16:32] way. People said one thing and another.
[2:16:35] Lord, we're tired. We are
[2:16:38] tired of worrying over
[2:16:41] people. People will hinder us. They'll
[2:16:43] slow us down.
[2:16:47] If David would have listened to his
[2:16:50] brothers, probably if David would have
[2:16:53] listened to David, David would have
[2:16:56] never killed
[2:16:59] Goliath. And that story would have never
[2:17:02] been
[2:17:04] written. Hallelujah.
[2:17:09] I love it, Lord. He said, "Let me
[2:17:10] repreach it there in Switzerland." And
[2:17:12] the prophet of God said that David went
[2:17:14] out there
[2:17:16] bouncing toward
[2:17:18] Goliath, dancing at Little Holy
[2:17:21] Roller. And he was dancing before the
[2:17:25] victory ever come.
[2:17:28] Praise God.
[2:17:30] Lord, we don't even dance after the
[2:17:32] victor's been here for 6
[2:17:34] months, but we want to be so loose and
[2:17:38] so free in your
[2:17:40] presence that we can praise, we can
[2:17:43] glorify, we can honor while we're still
[2:17:46] in the heat of the battle.
[2:17:49] Cuz as brother Tom Ray said it, it's
[2:17:52] done before it's
[2:17:54] done. It's done before it's
[2:17:57] done. Because faith says it's done
[2:18:01] before realities declare it's done.
[2:18:03] Hallelujah. That's the kind of people we
[2:18:06] want to be. That's the kind of church we
[2:18:08] want to be. Our healing is done before
[2:18:10] we ever get it. Hallelujah. We're
[2:18:13] already translated into the kingdom of
[2:18:15] his dear son. Or we're still here in
[2:18:18] mortal realm cuz that's the way you
[2:18:20] were. No man has come down from heaven
[2:18:23] say he which is from heaven even the son
[2:18:26] of man which is in heaven. What a
[2:18:28] peculiar statement for a man that was
[2:18:30] standing there right on the earth saying
[2:18:32] he was on the earth and heaven at the
[2:18:34] same time. I know a little bit about
[2:18:35] that feeling. So does every Holy Ghost
[2:18:37] fil child of God here tonight cuz we're
[2:18:40] set to roam in heavenly places in Christ
[2:18:42] Jesus while our earthly feet are still
[2:18:45] touching this globe that we live upon.
[2:18:48] Lord God, may we not be
[2:18:51] limited, oh Jesus, by people. May we not
[2:18:55] be limited by message critics that'll
[2:18:58] criticize this and criticize that. And
[2:19:01] that's what a lot of people stream us
[2:19:03] and a lot of folks other other preachers
[2:19:05] for is to only pick. Let them pick until
[2:19:07] they pick their brains out. But God, I'm
[2:19:10] sick and tired of pleasing people. We
[2:19:13] ain't interested in doing what this one
[2:19:15] wants and that one wants. Lord God, we
[2:19:18] want to please you. We want to worship
[2:19:21] you. Lord, take us into realms that
[2:19:24] we've never walked before. And we know
[2:19:26] you'll never leave your word. Never one
[2:19:28] time. And we we can always judge the
[2:19:31] spirit, but that's leading us cuz it'll
[2:19:34] never lead us away from the word of God.
[2:19:38] Oh, we worship you tonight, Jesus.
[2:19:41] We worship you tonight, Lord. Father,
[2:19:45] with a balanced revelation, we can say
[2:19:48] it this way.
[2:19:50] Who are we? By
[2:19:53] facts, we're people who make
[2:19:56] mistakes. By facts, people who fall
[2:19:59] short of the glory of God. By facts,
[2:20:03] people with nervousness, anxiety, all
[2:20:08] other kind of things that we could say,
[2:20:10] well, the facts are against you. That
[2:20:12] may be so. The facts may be stacked up
[2:20:16] against us right now, but the Lord is on
[2:20:20] our side.
[2:20:22] So, the facts are we're humans and we
[2:20:24] make mistakes. The facts are we're
[2:20:26] faulty, but the truth is we're forgiven.
[2:20:30] The facts are we're human beings and we
[2:20:33] fall short every day. But the truth is
[2:20:36] those who he has called, he has already
[2:20:38] justified. Those he has justified, he is
[2:20:41] already glorified.
[2:20:44] Hallelujah. The truth is he has already
[2:20:46] translated us into the kingdom of his
[2:20:49] dear son. The facts is we need more of
[2:20:52] God. But the truth is you see us already
[2:20:55] finished in the presence of God. We love
[2:20:58] you tonight, Lord. May we not just get
[2:21:00] our eyes on facts, but may we keep our
[2:21:03] eyes on the truth of the word of
[2:21:06] God. We love you, Lord. We know people
[2:21:09] have pulled away from this message
[2:21:11] because of the so-called facts. Brother
[2:21:15] Brandon would tell this story in this
[2:21:17] tape and tell a little bit different
[2:21:18] over there and they say, "Well, the
[2:21:20] facts don't line up." Well, he told this
[2:21:23] story here and told this one there. The
[2:21:25] facts don't line up. Well, that may be
[2:21:28] the truth, but he was still a prophet of
[2:21:32] God. So, we're not just looking at
[2:21:34] natural facts tonight. The facts are one
[2:21:37] of the writers said you had on a purple
[2:21:39] robe and another one said you had on a
[2:21:42] scarlet robe which are not the same
[2:21:45] thing. One of the writers said you took
[2:21:48] of that hissup and the other writer said
[2:21:51] you didn't.
[2:21:54] Oh
[2:21:55] hallelujah. Uhhuh. Let's discuss facts.
[2:21:59] But the truth is, you're the mighty God,
[2:22:02] the everlasting father, the first and
[2:22:04] the last, the alpha and the omega. None
[2:22:08] of those things stumble your children,
[2:22:11] Lord. Hallelujah. We worship you
[2:22:14] tonight, Lord
[2:22:15] God. Praise your name, Lord
[2:22:19] Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Can we just lift
[2:22:22] our hands in the presence of the Lord?
[2:22:25] Harry, sang a little something for us.
[2:22:26] And we just worship him a little bit
[2:22:27] before we go. I'm not going to hold you
[2:22:29] much longer, but let's just take a few
[2:22:31] moments in the presence of God.
[2:22:33] Hallelujah.
[2:22:39] Lead me, Lord, I'll follow.
[2:22:43] Hallelujah. Anywhere you open up the
[2:22:48] door. Oh
[2:22:51] yes. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:22:57] Your word speak to me. Speak to me, Lord
[2:23:00] God. Show me things I've never
[2:23:04] seen
[2:23:07] [Music]
[2:23:11] before. Lord, I want to be your
[2:23:17] witness. You can take what's wrong and
[2:23:21] make and make it right.

[2:23:28] my
[2:23:30] oh star shine down on
[2:23:34] me. Let your love shine through me in
[2:23:39] the

[2:23:47] night. We worship you Jesus. Sing it
[2:23:50] here. We worship you, Jesus. Now, let's

[2:23:55] it. Just let that word flow through your
[2:23:58] heart. Oh, shine through us,
[2:24:01] Jesus.
[2:24:03] Hallelujah. Rose, share,
[2:24:07] show me
[2:24:10] how beauty in God.

[2:25:28] Lord, I want to be a witness. I want to
[2:25:31] be a light. I want to be a preacher
[2:25:34] that'll preach the truth. Lord, baby,
[2:25:36] help me. Help me to guide your people,
[2:25:39] [Applause]
[2:25:40] [Music]
[2:25:43] Lord. Jesus, shine down on me.
[2:25:48] It
[2:25:51] [Music]
[2:25:56] sure. Hallelujah.
[2:25:59] Mercy. I see a world that's dying. I see
[2:26:03] this world dying. Wounded by the master
[2:26:08] of the sea. And think of it. We at one
[2:26:11] time were under that deceit.
[2:26:15] Oh, that rope in the
[2:26:20] darkness haunted
[2:26:23] by last
[2:26:25] [Music]
[2:26:36] [Music]
[2:26:39] defection in your eyes.
[2:26:47] My great day star shine shine down on
[2:26:53] me. Just shine through me in this dark
[2:26:59] night.

[2:27:09] follow any way you open up the
[2:27:13] [Music]
[2:27:16] door. Lord God, this is my
[2:27:20] desire. Let your words speak to
[2:27:24] me. Show me what I've never seen before.

[2:27:38] I want to be your
[2:27:40] witnesses. You can take what's
[2:27:44] wrong and make it all
[2:27:47] right. Make it like my
[2:27:52] own. They shall shine down on
[2:27:56] me. Let your love
[2:28:00] shine. Say that verse for us again,
[2:28:02] Harry. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:28:06] Hallelujah. I sing it
[2:28:08] standing. Lord, I see a world that's
[2:28:11] dying. Thank where they are. Children
[2:28:14] wounded by the master
[2:28:17] of deceit. Oh my God. That's where it
[2:28:20] would be tonight were not for your
[2:28:22] grace. Lord,
[2:28:25] [Music]
[2:28:27] groping in the darkness.
[2:28:30] Haunted by the years of past
[2:28:36] defeat. Oh my
[2:28:40] Lord. Then I see standing you alone

[2:31:08] Well, I know it was the
[2:31:11] blood. I know it was the
[2:31:15] blood. I know it was the blood for
[2:31:23] me. One day when I was
[2:31:27] lost, he died upon that
[2:31:31] cross. I know it was the blood for me.
[2:31:37] Everybody now. Oh, I know it was the
[2:31:42] blood. I know it was the
[2:31:46] blood. I know it was the blood for you
[2:31:51] and me.
[2:31:55] One day when I was
[2:31:58] wrong, he died upon the
[2:32:02] cross and know it was the blood for
[2:32:08] me. Sing it like this. Well, he's coming
[2:32:13] back
[2:32:14] again. He's coming back again.
[2:32:19] He's coming back again for you and
[2:32:26] me. One day when I was
[2:32:30] lost, he died upon that
[2:32:34] cross. And he's coming back again for
[2:32:39] you and me. I know it was the blood.
[2:32:43] Well, I know it was the blood.
[2:32:47] I know it was the
[2:32:50] blood. I know it was the blood for
[2:32:58] me. One day when I was lost, he
[2:33:04] died upon the moon. I know it was the
[2:33:10] blood for me.
[2:33:17] The devil don't like no shouting around
[2:33:19] here.
[2:33:21] About six months ago, I was down in the
[2:33:23] basement been playing preaching sermons
[2:33:25] and I'll place preaching sermons and
[2:33:27] then I'll break for a bit and I'll play
[2:33:29] songs, gospel songs. So, I sang this
[2:33:32] song that I had on one of my playlist
[2:33:34] and one of the verses with the song was,
[2:33:36] "If you had not
[2:33:38] come, I would have died and went to
[2:33:40] hell." So I just followed the words of
[2:33:42] the song along and said, "Lord," I just
[2:33:44] raised my eyes to him. I said, "Lord, if
[2:33:46] you had not come, I would have died and
[2:33:49] went to hell." He
[2:33:50] said, "You would
[2:33:56] not. I went to hell
[2:34:00] so you wouldn't have to."
[2:34:06] I can hear hellfire preached every
[2:34:08] night. Don't scare me. Cuz hell ain't my
[2:34:12] home.
[2:34:20] Hallelujah. Sing for us. Let's sing a
[2:34:23] little bit and we'll let you go. Ain't
[2:34:25] it been good to be in the house of the
[2:34:26] Lord? Praise
[2:34:29] God. Well, the devil don't like what's
[2:34:32] going on around
[2:34:34] here. Come on. You got your
[2:34:36] Pentecostals. Devil don't like what's
[2:34:38] calling on around here. But guess what?
[2:34:43] We don't care what the devil don't like.
[2:34:46] We going to praise our God tonight. The
[2:34:49] devil don't like what's going on around
[2:34:54] here. Come on, clap them in hand. Don't
[2:34:56] like us shouting loud around
[2:35:00] here. Well, I tried to like shout loud
[2:35:05] around here.
[2:35:08] Well, we don't care what the devil don't
[2:35:11] like. We're going to shout with all our
[2:35:14] might. The devil don't like us shouting
[2:35:20] around. Well, the devil don't like us
[2:35:23] praising God around
[2:35:27] here. Well, the devil don't like us
[2:35:30] praising God around
[2:35:32] [Music]
[2:35:34] here. And we don't care what the devil
[2:35:37] don't like. Want to praise our God with
[2:35:40] all of our might. The devil don't like
[2:35:43] us. Praise the
[2:35:46] [Music]
[2:35:48] God. I told him in Switzerland, I wonder
[2:35:51] if the story but had a different
[2:35:55] meaning. Sister had writing them was
[2:35:57] there in the house and brother Brandon
[2:35:58] was saying what he's supposed to say and
[2:36:00] the others were saying what they were
[2:36:02] supposed to say. And I wonder what would
[2:36:04] have happened if sister had just nodded
[2:36:08] her head
[2:36:12] and should look straight at brother
[2:36:14] Brandham and just nodded her head.
[2:36:18] Wonder if the outcome
[2:36:20] would be the same.
[2:36:24] But you know what, brother Benham turned
[2:36:25] when she said what she said and he said,
[2:36:28] "Sister Hattie,
[2:36:30] you said
[2:36:32] the right thing.
[2:36:35] Nod your head. That's all good. But the
[2:36:38] Bible tells you to clap your hands.
[2:36:42] The Bible tells you to sing
[2:36:46] and shout." Amen. And praise the Lord.
[2:36:50] Right? Yeah. So, when the Bible tells
[2:36:52] you to shout and you nod your head,
[2:36:56] wonder if that works.
[2:36:59] You know what we're doing? We're
[2:37:00] assurping what we think over what God
[2:37:03] said. God wants us to praise him.
[2:37:08] And he don't want you to just do it
[2:37:10] here.
[2:37:12] Let's sing it again. What about it,
[2:37:13] little Hattie? Y'all going to nod or you
[2:37:17] going to say something?
[2:37:19] God give you them hands. Brother Bram
[2:37:21] said he wanted to play an instrument,
[2:37:23] but he said God wouldn't let him. But he
[2:37:26] said then he found out that God let him
[2:37:28] play a 10 stringed
[2:37:33] instrument. Here they are. Here's your
[2:37:36] 10 strings. So what do what do you say
[2:37:38] we get them all tuned up here tonight
[2:37:40] and let's help these brothers make music
[2:37:43] to the
[2:37:44] Lord. Let's sing a little bit before we
[2:37:46] go. I'll let you go. This is more
[2:37:47] important. stand outside talking about
[2:37:49] your business and what you ate for
[2:37:50] supper and all that. Anyway, let's give
[2:37:53] him a little bit of loving before we go,
[2:37:54] shall
[2:37:55] [Applause]
[2:37:55] [Music]

[2:38:11] here. But we don't care what the devil

[2:38:16] hands with all of our might. The devil
