everybody look this way please new iPad but don't worry I've still got two spars in the back just in case that ever happens again don't get too nervous because all my quotes and scriptures are right here on the screen okay I understand we had to nearly call 45 ambulances on Sunday morning everybody was so nervous it ain't no wonder that devil was so mad is it did the Lord whoop him or what amen hallelujah oh we watch our God In Miracles and we watch him in healings and we watch him in things like that I love to watch him in battle that's right Revelation chapter 5 we'll read why that it is well with our soul tonight how it can be what our Lord did and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb now listen how many of them was there 4 and 20 so our Boaz has now gone before the witnesses at the gate having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song a new song that'll be what we'll be singing in heaven new songs we won't be singing I'll lay down my sword and shield Down by the Riverside won't be singing that one no more leave it there leave it there won't sing that one either we'll be singing new songs you imagine what it's going to be when Millions times millions of God's children will be singing and worshiping and praising through the ceaseless ages praise God and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy worthy to take the book notice how the song is fitting to the action in heaven so the words of the song are fitted to the occasion Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth Lord hasten the day and me like to be remember tonight as we pray dear God we believe your word is true we realize we are closer today than any other generation that's ever been on the earth to that great event father as we Endeavor to look into your word tonight I pray that you would help each of us help me Lord that I can be able to get out of the way and speak only that which would be of benefit to your people Lord God I ask that you would help them Lord no doubt many of them have worked today and they've had a schedule to try to watch out for and a time to do this and a time to go there and maybe they've had a hassle getting to the house of God but may the presence of the Lord come in this place so arrest our thoughts our goals our motives our purposes Our intention pull us up into a realm in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus may we be able to receive from the mighty hand of God help them Lord to pull on the gift help me to surrender to the gift May the spirit of God come and take charge of this service when it comes to its close may we leave here saying within our hearts did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us along the way would you grant it father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen God bless you Saints you may be seated what a great parallel between Boaz and Ruth and our Boaz Christ Jesus and his beloved Bride As Boaz could not complete Redemption at the threshing floor remember the threshing floor was a very special place in the mind of Ruth a great thing happened there a great occasion and it was there that she reached up and grabbed a hold of His Garment and and pulled it down over her which was a sign of betral no doubt it would always be special it would be a place that would have dear fond memories to her and also to him it was there that he told her to take her veil which she had wrapped around her she spread it out and he took some of the barley and laid it down into the four corners of that and then sent her to her mother-in-law's house house to wait for the work of redemption great things happened there but yet Boaz could not complete the work of redemption at the threshing floor as great as the miracle was in canaa of Galilee when our lord Jesus turned water into wine as great as it was when the syro Phoenician woman came with her knee whenever the Roman Centurion came with with his neede other great places and I've stood there a couple of times in my life in many of those places and there's just something about standing there as we stood there the last time we were there and they had just recently found uh Simon the house where his mother-in-law laid and there was these old Stones right there beside the lake and quite amazing they' found the the original stones that were there over 2,000 years old that had been part of the synagogue of capernium and right from there within Rock throwing distance was where the house where Peter's mother-in-law lay and the Lord Jesus went there and touched her great events great things happened there and whenever you go through there and you realized there was all of those was part of making the story ruths finding Boaz and happing across the right field great events wonderful things but he could not complete the work of redemption at the field where he first met her he could not complete the work of redemption at the threshing floor as great as it was neither could our lord Jesus complete the work of redemption at the cross he could not complete it at the tomb never such an event had happened before like happened at the tomb on that Resurrection morning but yet that Redemption could not be completed at the cross Redemption could not be completed on that Resurrection morning when he raised and done this great Defiance against the kingdom of hell now I know that for some they look at that like brother Donnie why why would you say that it's because it's the truth all of those things are leading up of the steps into Redemption and we must follow God as God unfolds the steps I mean know the prophet even tells us in in those great works that there's two stages of it coming out and going into so the children of Israel came out of the land of redemption but their work of redemption was not finalized when they left sihon whenever they come out and they finally break beyond the pyramids and they finally go over and they come against OG and they come against Bashan and they come against those different ones they still had not received their full inheritance until they come back and they were the actual possessors of the land so Redemption truly has stages I want you to notice then so our lord Jesus when he died on the cross the blood the price had finally been submitted so God needed a currency by which the book of redemption could be purchased so it was was lost by a man who stood in perfect peace with God it was forfeited by a Son of God that was not a sinner forfeited by a Son of God who is in the correct image that God made him so there must be an exchange by which God can accept something back by which the transfer of the book can go back into the hands of men so Adam forfeited his rights to the title deed of the Earth the book of Redemption all of our names now remember your name was on that book then so when Adam had that book your name was written there and when he forfeited that then there must be a price that would be paid so it had to be more than a lamb it had to be more than chemistry of a blood it had to be more than just a good person a prophet couldn't do it righteous man couldn't do it so God had to make a currency which would be acceptable I'd like to go into it sometime if the Lord would let me how's that there was a Redemption money that was issued let me just give you a consensus of it real quick there was a Redemption money which was called a shackle of the Tabernacle and God instituted that because by him allowing the firstborn to live coming out of the first Exodus and God took all the firstborn of the Egyptians but God said I claim all the firstborn as mine so every firstborn son that opens the Matrix was the word that God used that son is mine so every firstborn of The Oxen of the cattle of the Sheep of the donkeys whatever they owned every one of them belonged to God now the reason was because God allowed the firstborn to live so if God allowed the firstborn to live you owe God this debt you see this is why I look at it and our lives as children of God God allowed me to live so I hold him everything I am and so do you now a lot of people don't see it that way they look as at Grace is that God gives them everything they know they owe nothing back to God they don't understand what the reconciliation is all about so they want to still live their own life do their own thing the way dress the way they want to dress talk the way they want to talk do whatever they want to do but they want to be recipients of Grace and then God basically gets nothing back I don't understand Redemption that way myself so God said because I've spared the firstborn all of your firstborn horn is mine now as we go on then when the levitical order is established and God is going to have a priesthood by which will be a substitute and When God says now I'll tell you what Moses I want you I'm going to take all the tribe of Levi and I will substitute a levite for the firstborn I want you to number all of the Levites so they number them and then they number number all of the firstborn well what they wound up with was a number that there was more firstborn than the were Levites so it would be like this so here's a levite there's one there's one there's one there's one well if a levite and you say well here's my son here's my son here's my son all right will you stand for him yes will you stand for him I will will you take his place will you take his place yes yes I will all right you come into the service of the Lord you can go home you are free because these Levites took your place but they wound up having more firstborn than they had Levites so now what are they going to do so God said I will set up an exchange and it will be according to the shekele of the Tabernacle now this is going to be be monetary value and God says I will take so much for each one of your firstborn so many shekels for each one so all the Levites that they had substituted for the firstborn and then they had so many left over God said all right now what you're going to have to do you're going to have to buy your firstborn from me because I own them so according to the Tabernacle now remember not of the shackle of the Romans the Roman dinardi or the other Turkish money or whatever it was but God made a special currency an allocation that was called the shekele of the Tabernacle or it was also called The Ransom money The Ransom money so if you wanted your firstborn son to come home with you and be your son and he could get married and he could inherit your land then you had to buy him from god wow so every one of them sons and totally up to Mom and Daddy and Mom and Daddy said I don't like that Rascal no way let him go on to serve God maybe he can do more with him than I can what if they didn't redeem him he was under obligation to go to the house of God carry water chop wood carry the tent carry the gold carry this that the other but if they wanted him in their home they had to redeem him so God had to make an acceptable currency don't you understand what God was foreshadowing in the substitutionary value of giving something because God knowing that there would be an age coming afterwards when the Gentiles would be come in that he must establish a Divine currency that would would be accepted because the levitical order is going to pass away I'm glad I ain't got a levite standing for me tonight ain't you glad you ain't got a preacher standing for you we ain't got no Pope we ain't got no Bishop we ain't got no hierarchy nowhere but God made a currency what was it another shekele of the Tabernacle the real Tabernacle of the Lord so God said then I will allow you to buy your firstborn back from me and I will set up the currency that I will receive for them and they will be yours now he's doing the same thing when it comes to our kinsman redeemer so God is going to make a currency that will be able to have a value that will be even more worse even more than what we would be that we would look at ourselves and others would look at us and say there's no way I'm worse the death of the Lord Jesus there's no way that I am worth all that it cost him but the way he looks at it you are so you see it's not so much the way we look at ourselves and we're constantly under evaluating ourselves because we're looking at our Humanity looking at our failures and our shortcomings and we all have them don't we and we look at us and then we look at the currency and we think there's no way the currency was pure the currency was holy the currency was righteous it was Sanctified and we say I'm not worthy I'm not worthy there's no way I can be worthy of that but he looks at you and said but I deem it worthy I deem you worth surprise that I must pay this is why the Bible says that he for Joy the joy that was set before him enduring the cross despising the shame what was the joy set before him you and your fellowship so he looked at what he must pay and he looked at what he would get back and to him it was well worth the cost now whenever he does that on the cross then the father God have now made an acceptable currency that could be received on your behalf now when the Lord Jesus goes out to the cross of course he becomes in transubstantiation for our sins and our sins is laid upon him now he dies out of the presence of God he dies to death not as of a righteous man but as a sinner so whenever he does that he goes down into Paradise for first he goes into the regions of the lost and there he preaches to the souls that were in prison which were sometime disobedient while the ark was being prepared now he haunts them with a message of Deliverance he goes on Down Deeper beyond that realm of that Fifth Dimension and he goes down into Hades or sheld itself and he knocks on the door and of course you know the story he reaches in and grabs the keys off the devil and then he slams the door shut and then he goes over to where Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Zachariah Malachi all the righteous were and then he sets them free Paradise is emptied out now whenever he comes back and he raises on the Easter morning on the third day now the currency is entering in to a receivable form you see father God could not receive the currency in the crucified form hanging on the cross the Lord Jesus could could not go by form of theophany directly into the gate directly into the presence of God do you understand he died out of the presence of God so that you and I on our death don't have to now don't get in your mind that the Lord Jesus went straight to heaven that's totally impossible our sins were upon him well don't look at me that way demonology part two parag 199 when I think of how that Jesus went to hell and God because of his sins sent him to hell now remember he never committed any sins but it's what he placed upon himself in order to become the currency that could be exchanged for you praise the Lord so he could not go straight into the presence of God so what's going to happen now he must have this pattern by which which he will Ascend into the gate but he doesn't go directly after his resurrection now watch this in John 20 verse 16 now Here Comes Mary to the Lord Jesus Jesus saith unto her Mary she turned herself and saith unto him Roni which is to say master Jesus saith unto her touch me not touch me not now this verb means to fasten to so it's not just a momentary touch to word that you Reach Out And Touch somebody and then take your hand away but it is to grab a hold of and not let go now remember Mary sees her Lord so what she wants to do is cling to him in the way that she was used to now this look like the Lord Jesus but in one sense of the word it is but it ain't it ain't the same Lord Jesus that she knew as a human this is the glorified Lord Jesus but he must have looked like he did so much before that she couldn't tell the difference now we know he could appear in that way but it was so much like what she had known for these three years or three and a half years ever long it was that she reaches out to grab a hold of him which it was customary for the women to do and grab a hold of their Master the rabbi the raboni they would grab a hold of their feet and their legs at the bottom so she was reaching out to do the same thing but Jesus said Mary don't touch me touch me not was the words that he said so what is she doing she's now wanting to renew her old form of contact in the way that she knew Jesus before his death burial and Resurrection so this is how she knew him before sight sound and touch sight sound and touch so she's reaching out to reestablish this old way of communication by which knew him but Jesus is stopping her and saying now look Mary that this is not the time for that type of an experience because after my Ascension you will know me by faith through the spirit it will no longer be sight sound and touch don't you understand it must have been so hard for them to believe that the Lord Jesus is going to leave and they're not going to say him again that was the only thing they knew was the Corporal body so he's showing them Mary no no no don't touch me but now remember he's not just doing it for that way oh my may God help us that open our understanding Lord this communion will be possible after my Ascension now remember he's raised from the dead he's died for our sins paid the penalty and he's raised from the dead but he's not yet entered into to the anot type of Leviticus 7 16 and that is what the day of atonement for the day of atonement the high priest alone would enter in behind the veil into the shakai and as he would enter into the shakai go in and out of there seven times and change his garments each time he went in and come out and he would take blood first for himself and then for the sins of the people he had already taken one goat and released it and now he's killed the other one and he takes the blood in there and he is going to Bear the names of the children of Israel upon his breastplate each one of them has a stone and the presence of God would hit those stones and illuminate these beautiful iridescent colors so as he walked in before the presence of God he's bearing the names of the 12 tribes you were identified on his chest if you were a Jew if you're the tribe of napali of Ephraim of Manasseh of Judah of isachar of Reuben so on and so on that birthstone had your identity and when that priest walked in there he walked in there representing you and if God would accept him God Oh Glory would accept you now remember none of the children of Israel ever got to go in on the day of atonement not even the Levites not even the regular Priestly order only the high priest alone it is the high priest that is speaking to Mary touch me not oh Hallelujah as high priest he speaks to Mary and says don't touch me but what is the difference but the time that he tells her not to touch him when the disciples are gathered together again a few days later after this and Thomas had missed it and then they he appeared again and Thomas said I I'll not believe unless I put my hand I've got to touch them nail Prince boy I've got to put my hand in his side and Jesus walked right in and said come here Thomas you want to you want to touch me touch me handle me how in the world could he do that he had already taken the money up before the Throne of God now after it had been delivered and the ransom Oh Glory to God and the ransom money had been received now the exchange can start taking place for the liberated Souls thank you Lord Jesus now notice having accomplished the sacrifice he is now on his journey to present the blood up into the father's presence now what's he going to do he's going to bring the blood up before the father Before the Throne of God and even with that happening the seals are still not broke now notice at the path of redemption so he dies on the cross he sheds his blood he then goes down into the regions of the lost and and does what he does there then he raises back up on the third day ascends up to the father and Revelation 5 still was not broke open when he brought the blood before the father why not yet time remember Revelation 5 follows after chapter 1 2 3 and four which is the revealing of the church ages look at how redemption's plan can span apart for thousands of years the Lord Jesus has been working on a gentile Bride for over 2,000 years getting them out of Germany getting them out of Africa getting them out of China Indonesia all around around the world calling and Gathering them working on them molding them shaping them and think of it we're in the last stages of that phase of redemption but I want you to notice what he goes on to say Jesus saith unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my father but this is what I want you to do but go to my brethren I want you to understand the Lord Jesus had referred to his followers as disciples he even referred to them as friends in St John 15:15 I believe it is referred to them as friends but he had never called them brothers yet so with his raising from the dead and on his way to bring the Redemption money he goes ahead and lets out a family secret glory to God but go to my brethren and say unto them I ascended glory to God unto my father and your father to my God and your God now watch what he's showing to Mary a new relationship will begin after my Ascension the Redemption money that I will pay which is what himself so when he walks into the presence of spirit God before the justice of his small the full account is settled right then and there glory to God the full account your full price was paid right there because when father God saw him in that resurrected form the resurrected form is your sign that your price has been paid just the human form of the Lord Jesus was not the sign that it had been paid it was the sign it was going to be but the res resurrected Son of God was the sign that father had been pleased with him he went down and died with that death upon him and the curse of the law but when he raised from the dead I am he that was dead but I am alive forever more notice how Paul picks this up in Hebrews chapter 2:1 for both he that sanctifies and they who are Sanctified are all of one of which because he is not ashamed to call them Brethren verse 12 saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church I don't know how Jesus is going to do that believe Jesus don't believe in going to church do you so apparently Jesus believes in going to church then when you get to church Jesus is going to come among you and Jesus is going to declare the name of Father God well praise the Lord God goes to church in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee verse 17 wherefore in All Saints it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren you imagine he's calling them Brethren before they ever got saved well Hallelujah he's calling them Brethren it behooved him to be made like to his Brethren why so his Brethren could be made like unto him but you see the order of redemption is he must be made like us first before we can be made like him so if he has been made like me then there is a promise with the Vindication of his resurrection I shall be made like him and John says for it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is oh my that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people so now he unveils part of the family plan to make real true Holy Ghost filled Believers part of the family of Father God Jesus sath unto her touch me not for I'm not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father notice how he says this my father and your father wonder why he doesn't just say our father when he was teaching them how to pray before the resurrection he says say these words Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come right you know the story but now after the resurrection before the Ascension and the blood being laid upon the altar of atonement then what does he do he introduces a position to his new Believers that's going to be filled with the Holy Ghost and he brings them right on the plateau and standing right there by him my father father and your father my God and your God I wish at least one person would get that Revelation tonight you'll tear up hell if you do you'll never be the same person again notice this my father and your father I wonder what the disciples thought whenever Sister Mary come in said Brothers I want to let y'all know I've seen Jesus yeah right sure if he was going to appear to anybody he appear to us preachers or deacons or trustees he sure would appear to no woman I mean had appeared to the men men run the church well come on Brothers don't sit there and just smile at me notice so he appears to a woman and then he gives the woman this word now she's not called to preach of course but he gives her this salutation to bring back to his brothers of such incomparable incomparable Glory that that it would take it would take years do you understand this Glory that he spoke over 2,000 years ago is still trying to be comprehended how many through the church ages understood these few words I wonder how many sitting in this building tonight do words of incomparable Glory Jesus had habitually called God his father and on the cross is God but the disciples had not but watch Jesus as he merges father God father God hallelujah father God he is my father and he's yours he's my God and he's yours so you're not separate you're not separate from the the beginning of the creation of God so if you could get it in your mind there on the circle of Eternity before there was any stars molecules Adam or light no stars no nothing nothing like that and there he was he wanted to project himself and he wanted to condens sin and make himself more apparent he wanted to become a human he wanted to express all that he was and there was nothing above him he couldn't go any higher so he wanted to expand himself I said we can do that because we're we're constantly expanding we're learning more we're doing more we think tomorrow well I you know I'm going to do this and then by the end of the week we're saying I wish I done it that well wish i' done this would save me two hours work because we're constantly learning but he could not learn anymore there was nothing greater there was nothing higher there was nothing any more powerful there was nothing any more lovable but yet he still wanted to expand himself so he couldn't go no higher so the only way to expand himself was go down go down to the act of condensation he must come down so he starts creating toward the lower forms of life and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same as in the beginning with God all things were created by Him without him was not anything made that was made so he went down not up no wonder the prophet said the Way Up Is Down we still got it backwards so what did God do he went down down hallelujah hallelujah so he started in the act of condensation so in the beginning was the word but what was before the beginning that's when Moses picks it up Genesis 1:1 in the beginning was the word John 1:1 and the Word was made fleshly say in verse 14 so what was before the beginning the Eternal the Eternal but when time began was the word and the word become into a form that had we been there we've been able to seen it so it's like a little white light playing around the father's door a condescended form of the great Eternal now he always wanted to reveal himself and he thought of you and he thought of me and he thought of a universe and he thought of planets and stars and so on and believe it or not he thought of himself as being a human that's all I've been my 67 years and I can't wait to become something else but he thought of himself as being a human but now don't get in your mind that the end of his thought was just living those 33 and A2 years on the earth he was thinking of himself in this Loop of time of that part of his journey but also when he come down to death and resurrection that he would continue to live in a human form through eternity you see whenever we look there in the great City and John said I saw one that W to set upon the throne and we know that in the eth day when we gather there in the New Jerusalem comes down from God out of heaven and there will be the embodiment of God's love the purchase money setting on the throne it will be the human body the Lord Jesus that will constant be going up before our Joseph and where will the father be well father God's not an old man that sits upon a great big Throne you know and sent over in Jesus his little boy sent down on the other side but the father God Jesus said God is a spirit first Timothy Paul says now unto the king Eternal Immortal the only wise God be glory and Dominion forever and ever is that right so what is the father it will be that light which will hover over the Sun so when we go to approach in his presence in the eth day the Corporal body that God thought about himself dwelling in but there was any time will be setting right there on his throne and you and I will approach it we'll go in and out and we will live it will be a continuation of this same life why because God paid the price and God made a shekele that was tangible that he could receive payment for our souls oh my notice so that both out together father God I love addressing him that way in prayer father God what an awesome privilege given to us as Mortals oh many Christians can call him the father of our Lord Jesus Christ and that is scripture but it's also scripture to say he is my father of which he is not ashamed I'm going to blow you away I know the Lord Jesus can look at my regenerated soul and if he was here tonight he could put his arm around me and look me in the face and say my brother my sister my brother my sister for his mother was standing outside one day when he was teaching and some of them came unto him and said your mother and your brothers are outside and they want to see thee he said who is my mother and my brothers but those who keep now watch what he's doing he's giving he doesn't say they are yet but he's giving an insight to what's going to happen those that obey the word they become burst into the family of God am don't you understand Jehovah did not want to live millions of miles away as it were or in another dimension from his people he wanted to live in the world we live in now watch he doesn't say it in a way to make us to where that we are some other race some other species or some other kind but children you look at it this way say my father and your father my God and your God and when you pray I give you my name you are my Representatives you are my ambassadors as a matter of fact you are me in another form Hallelujah notice this in souls and prison now you see in this book was what was redeemed it was the book of redemption and everything that he had redeemed was written in that book all that he died for was written in the book and he could not leave his mediatorial seat until he thoroughly redeemed and he couldn't redeem it at the cross don't you see why Satan wants millions of Christians to stop at the cross the majority of Christian preachers they never go any farther yes sir that's all they preach that's all they talk about why that's all they know so it takes a man who's went through the cross to the Redemption money to come back and tell you hey there's more to this than two pieces of wood aren't you glad God send us such men down to the ages seven Church age Messengers and then men out from under their Ministry are burst by the same spirit of God Anointed with the same Holy Ghost now watch he could not redeem it at the cross because they were predestinated in the Lamb's Book of Life and he had to stay on there to make intercessions where on the mercy seat so he ass sends up Mary backs off leaves him alone she's probably startled about don't know what to believe and then then whenever she goes and Jesus descends up somehow in that time he transition Goes Up Before the Throne of God and when he walks into the throne room oh Hallelujah and the justice of God is met then he can say father I'm going to go back down and save my brothers for a bit I'm going to have a little fellowship with them oh Hallelujah I'm going to eat a little fish with them eat a little hakes amen I I want to I want to go down there and spend a little time with my brothers I love them I miss them I want to be with them I want to I want to tell them what to look for now so that they can go ahead and be burst in the family because I have presented myself to you so the way has been made clear and their debt Oh Glory to God their debt is paid so on the day of Pentecost which will be 40 days after his Ascension of course when Pentecost means 50 so this is the Feast of the in gathering and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in one place and one mind and one Accord which is a miracle within itself ain't it and there come a sound as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and clothing tongues like as a fire set upon each of them and they begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit of God gave them utterance come on somebody don't you understand what happened the Lord God sent down their deposit Hallelujah your price has been paid come on in brother Peter come on in brother James come on in brother John amen they are now full-fledged Sons but now remember he didn't leave The Mercy Seat on the day of Pentecost and take the seven seal book still remain in the hands of Father God watch what he says he couldn't do it he couldn't redeem it at the cross because it predestinated the Lamb's Book of Life and he had to stay on there to make intercessions until that last person I'm glad he would do it that way in case it'd be me me or you or you or you or you might be one of my granddaughters might be some of my family it might be some of yours aren't you glad well he said well I've got all these people here what does one matter one matters one matters to the Lord God there won't be one I don't care who they are I don't care how long he has to beat the fire out of them until they get them where they need to be he's going to get them so if you're here tonight and you're not where you need to be if I as you just go ahead and get in cuz he will get you cuz he's greater than you are he's got more power than the devil's got he's got more power than alcohol he's got more power than drug addiction he's got more power than the things of the world and he will sit on that motorial bench until that last one is finished not just saved finished until that last person was finished praise God God you imagine this beautiful piece of Walnut right here when it first busted up out of the ground a little tiny Shute out of a walnut seed that may be a squirrel planted in the fall it took it years and years and years to be able to grow to get these tree rings I'm looking right now and seeing the age rings and one of the knots on this board took years years and years remember brother John went over and found it talked to a guy we needed so much board feet for this and this and all this other stuff it's rough has to be plained has to be straight edged brother John has to take glue it put it together brother Donnie stained it brother D brother Dan finished it all the years of work all the years that that Warner Tree struggle through the storms trying to hold its ground keep from getting blowed out of the ground and it struggled and it struggled look what it turned out to be hallelujah look at you struggling with this struggling with that ups and downs and ins and outs and one trial after another this ain't nothing compared to what you're going to be when you're finished oh hallelujah oh my you look at the things that God and his wisdom allows us to go through but you think Lord will I ever get there you will because God has ordained it and nothing will stop you from reaching that place oh my notice in Hebrews 9:22 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no remission it was therefore necessary that the patterns of the things in the heavens should be purified with these but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these 1 Timothy 2:5 for there is one God and one mediator look at the meaning of this word one who intervenes between two e either in order to make or restore peace and friendship a form a compact or ratifying a covenant a medium of communication an arbitrator so an arbitrator is used many times when there are legal disputes and it can save it from going to a courtroom because an arbitrator is one that can stand between this party and that party and is not biased supposedly where they can be able to read the law and say well the law said this and you left this word out in your contract and you didn't say that no you misunderstood the contract you thought it meant this and that so the arbitrator can come out with a decision the Lord Jesus walked in and said I am the great emancipator I am the arbitrator I am the establisher of the Divine Covenant I am the purchaser of my brethren I am here to settle their debts I declare they are free forever more I declare hallelujah hallelujah they are mine I am theirs and we are yours father they come from you the same way I come from you and you love them even as you loved me can you believe that he loves me the same way he loved the Lord Jesus on mindboggling right we need help Lord there is only one God in one mediator between God and man the oh so the mediator had to be a man not only be one but remain one now notice Paul this is years after his resurrection so now he's referring to the glorified man you see because of our Humanity we so look down on man but you're looking at the Fallen man God looks at the raised man you understand the prophet tells us it will be eternal life in a human body wouldn't it be something that you never got old you never had an ache or of pain you never got tired you ever realize the houses in heaven won't have beds there'll be no lazy boys brother so get up you lazy boys get about your father's business we will not be tired we will never set up there in heaven with our head down in our hand oh oh I don't know what I'm going to do I I don't know how that'll never be there'll never be one person walk down those streets of gold with the first moment of sadness we'll feel no sorrow no heaviness Lord children just by those who have dreams and those who are carried beyond the curon of time and see all those people over in there in that sixth Dimension I've never yet heard anybody talk about them people of our crying them being sad wore out but they're running they're rejoicing they're smiling they're laughing why because they cannot be sad there no sadness is allowed no sorrow is allow and yet what kind of world will that be when we come back to this Earth because the Lord Jesus also paid the price for this Earth this Earth is going in the full cycle of redemption as well you say why don't he destroy it and make a new and he can't her name is in the Book of Life show me where the Bible mentions Pluto show me where the Bible mentions Saturn Neptune Mars but the Earth's name is in the Book of Life she is a redeemable attribute of God he cannot throw her away hallelujah hallelujah oh she Bears the scars of her past yes sir I just saw a picture today of a diver that was down in Florida if you can imagine it down in waters there off the coast of Florida going around digging for you know different and things whatever he could find and and much to his surprise he drew up a madon Tusk three boys just a while back in the in the South Dakota dug up and found a dinosaur what is it it's the Earth's geological record of her past but one day all them dinosaur bones and all them Mastadon Bones the fire of God will come down and burn so deep it will destroy oh Hallelujah all of her old record just like it did to you when you were filled with the Holy Ghost and the Lord God annihilated your old book and destroyed that old record of your geological past and God said you are my son you are my daughter I never remember you cursing I never remember you drinking I never remember you running around all I remember is you as my child Hallelujah I am your father I am your [Applause] God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hebrews 886 but now hasth he obtained more excellent Ministry but how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon better promises Romans 8:34 who is he that condemn us it is Christ that died yeay rather that is risen again who's even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us I love the prophets in it this way the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever he's a high priest sitting there make an intercession Upon Our confession we have to confess it first you're sick tonight confess it he's my healer you're bound by a besetting sin confess it tonight you devil you have no right you have no claim on my life get under my feet that's where you [Applause] belong we have to confess it first before he can be the high priest because he only intercedes to our confession yes can you believe that he only intercedes to what he hears us say so if we say I'm no good I'm worthless I have no value he cannot intercede on that confession but if you say I was worthless but he considered me worth a price now he says now I can say what you're saying I was no good but he changed me I was unrighteous but now I'm the righteousness of God in him by his stripes I'm already healed the doctor don't give me much hope but that ain't what Jesus said I I know what the doctor's report is but I believe there's another report by his stripes ye are already healed then he goes to work on your confession Oh my he only intercedes Upon Our confession what we confess that he is what he has done for us not what he will do Oh my he has already done it already we have to confess that he's done it we he wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed you know I feel so sorry for those folks are in our ranks that feel like intercession is over man I'd hate to think I'd live a today on this life without the Lord Jesus interceding for me how many you good Holy Ghost people that love Jesus with all your heart have needed intercession since Sunday come on be honest watch says we absolutely know the infinite God predestinated all things by his for knowledge before the foundation of the world even the lamb was slain and every name that would ever be on the book was on the book before the book was ever written your name was on the book before the book was ever written your name was on the book before the book was ever written your name was on the book before the book was ever written that sounds like a mighty God will your name was on the book before the book was ever written your name was on the book before the book was ever written your name was on the book before the book was ever written that sounds like a Mighty God where ain't no devil in hell can stop you Ain no devil in hell can stop you ain't no devil in hell can stop you that sounds like a mighty God let's stand and Jesus came to redeem those that were in the book in the Bible the lamb came from behind the curtain and taken the book and opened the seals that it was sealed with for he come to claim all he had redeemed he's the intercessor now an intercessor making intercession for those he has redeemed all those whose names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life is redeemed go wait Jesus every name that was ever put on that book Jesus came to redeem and when the last's name is redeemed the book is closed now he didn't intend that no one be lost but his forign knowledge let him know who would be lost therefore he could predestinate and then their names is put on the book then when that book of redemption is closed seal with Seven Seals why it's being worked out by the mysterious power of God and someday the book of redemption is finished ah and the lamb takes it then the last name is called off of that the lamb comes forward to call what he has redeemed that's his church and I believe the time is close as hand amen hallelujah hallelujah and now if you were in the quickening at his beginning if you were in the quickening at his beginning that's what he come to redeem and your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life in his thinking at the beginning if you were in the quickening at his beginning now remember we were not children like little babies around the Throne of God or even mature Sons and Daughters of God but we were Sals in his mind if you can receive it you were at his beginning when he was quickened in the form of the condescended word in his thinking you were quickened with him praise God and your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life and his thinking and he came to redeem all names that's in that book no more not one more just what was in there when that last name is redeemed he takes his book and claims what he has redeemed can I read one more we wonder why the Revival is not going on now why we don't see the enthusiasm with the people I don't know why but let's just think what if it's like this maybe there's a little boy in here tonight or a little girl was born over in Seattle Washington now that book holds her name he come to redeem whose name was on the book R redeem means bring back from where it fell from in the human race she was fail she can't accept it now she's too young so the church WIll slug oh yeah come on you bunch of slugs the church WIll slug Welly that describes us pretty good sometimes don't it the church WIll slug right along play along while you reckon we're playing Church come on play in church little brother and little sister play in church one day she Saidi want to testify first he said no I'm testifying first she said no I want to testify first he said I'll go ahead she said I want to thank the Lord for giving me the victory he said you didn't get the victory you just got your own way that's the way we are that's the way we determine Victory we're Victorious when God answers our prayers according to way we thought best sometimes your greatest Victor is when God tells you an outright no and you say your ways are perfect Lord God your ways are perfect and you make you make no mistakes you just gained a tremendous Victory right there notice oh my the church WIll slug along play along have meetings and so forth friends do it whenever we come to church and we say well it's just going to church it's going to church we're fulfilling this quote he didn't say well the church just stays home the church I

every one of us may be waiting on till that last person is brought in then that book is Clos there is no more added than it's all over may God help us you love him with all your hearts it's mystery really when you look at the book how many times it's opened and how many times it's closed opened and closed so it had to be opened for the names to be called out when the last name is called it's closed when the book is closed means it's time for you to go home for the last name pulled off means the names have been redeemed now the book is made manifest in flesh so he just closes the book and gets the product of the book amen let's bow our it together oh Lord God how great you sure oh no wonder the author of the song said then sings my soul my savior God to thee How Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art Mighty God thank you for becoming the Redemption money the true shekele of the true true Tabernacle to pay the price for every name written in that book lord God I pray you would search the Earth maybe that last seed is in a federal prison somewhere maybe that last seed is in a local jail or might be on a honky Tong tonight with a beer in their hand maybe they just shot up with their favorite kind of dope they may be dope addicts now but if their name is on that book they ain't going to remain that cuz you will get them Lord God help us as people that's been in church for years

father may we be witnesses as you said in the book of Isaiah ye are my Witnesses saeth the Lord that I am he make us better Witnesses oh God may it not just be by Theology and not just quoting of
