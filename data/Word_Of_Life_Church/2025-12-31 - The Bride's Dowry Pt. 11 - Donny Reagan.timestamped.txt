[13:19] through so many things, Lord, as a a
[13:22] church and individuals, Lord. We've seen
[13:25] a lot of death and sorrow and heartache,
[13:29] but Lord Jesus, on the other side of
[13:31] that, we've seen you come through so
[13:32] many times, Lord. You've been such an
[13:35] awesome God, Lord. It's not like we ever
[13:38] doubted that, Father. But sometimes we

[13:53] And we we hear these prayer requests,
[13:55] Father, and we don't just bring them
[13:57] before you in vain, Lord Jesus. But we
[14:00] bring them before you, Lord Jesus,
[14:02] because we know that you're more than
[14:04] able, Father.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, you've done it before in
[14:07] the past. And Lord, we believe you're
[14:09] going to do it in the future. And even
[14:12] each and every one, Father, we just lift
[14:14] them up before you and and bring them
[14:15] boldly before your throne, Father,
[14:17] because we have we have that right as
[14:19] children, as sons and daughters. And
[14:21] Lord Jesus, we love you and thank you so
[14:24] much for it, Lord Jesus.

[14:29] Lord, if you were to come back, Lord, in
[14:31] the first day of of 2026. Lord, we're
[14:35] waiting for you every day, every hour,

[25:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[26:01] &gt;&gt; And so sweet
[26:07] I [singing] reach the [music] strength
[26:13] still
[26:15] in [singing and music] love
[26:20] beyond [music and singing]
[26:22] seeing hand.
[26:26] [music]
[26:29] I long [singing]
[26:31] to see
[26:34] [music]
[26:36] my Savior's [singing] face [music]
[26:42] and sing [singing]
[26:44] the storm.
[26:48] [music]
[26:48] be saved by [singing]
[26:51] grace.
[26:54] [music]
[26:55] And there [singing]
[26:56] upon
[27:01] that [singing] golden [music]
[27:03] strength.
[27:07] I'll praise him [singing] for
[27:13] his guiding [singing]
[27:15] hand.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; [music]
[27:19] &gt;&gt; I'm [singing] trusting to
[27:26] the unseen [music and singing]
[27:28] hand
[27:32] that [singing]
[27:33] God [music] me
[27:41] [music]
[27:45] [singing] and
[27:51] I'll [music and singing] reach that
[27:53] strength
[27:57] still guide.
[28:01] [singing]
[28:03] We [music]
[28:04] don't see
[28:07] [singing]
[28:10] as [music]
[28:12] we
[28:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[28:16] &gt;&gt; I'll [singing] reach that strength.
[28:22] [music]
[28:22] Still God [singing]
[28:27] [music]
[28:29] the [singing]
[28:30] unseen.
[28:36] [music]

[33:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. God bless y'all.
[33:44] Amen. Wasn't that wonderful?
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's good to be with
[33:48] you tonight. We say God bless you. Amen.
[33:52] And uh I tell you there's there's uh
[33:55] only a few places we feel so at home and
[33:57] this is one of them. So we just want to
[33:58] say we love you and we thank you for for
[34:00] your love that you showed to us. Good to
[34:02] have my my dad and my sister with me
[34:05] tonight and my family. I also have my
[34:07] nieces who should have sung tonight,
[34:09] brother Donnie, but uh uh I'm the one
[34:12] that has to go home with them so I won't
[34:14] force them to do that. They they're
[34:15] fighting some sickness. It's been going
[34:18] around. But aren't you thankful for
[34:19] those prayers that go forth for us.
[34:22] Amen.
[34:24] Amen. Some of us have been through some
[34:26] really hard times this year. We've lost
[34:29] some [music] folks.
[34:32] Amen. Just talking to brother Bobby
[34:34] telling me about the loss of his son.
[34:35] [music] Amen.
[34:37] Lost our mother-in-law this this year
[34:39] just a few months ago. [music]
[34:41] But God was with us through it all. And
[34:43] and I I know that you may not realize
[34:46] this, [music] but we felt those prayers
[34:48] coming from this assembly. And I just
[34:50] want to say thank you. Amen.
[34:52] When we're in those uh mountaintop
[34:54] experiences, we [music] don't think
[34:56] about it as much, but when you're in the
[34:58] valley, you sure appreciate those
[34:59] things. Amen. So, this song, I hope, is
[35:02] a blessing to you. It's just real
[35:03] simple. Tonight,
[35:06] somebody's praying.
[35:10] I can feel it. [music]
[35:16] Somebody's praying
[35:20] for me. [music]
[35:25] Mighty hands [singing] are guiding
[35:27] [music]
[35:28] me to protect me from what I can't see.
[35:35] And Lord, I believe. [music]
[35:40] Lord,

[35:46] somebody's praying

[35:51] [singing]
[35:55] Somebody's praying.
[35:59] I can't feel it. [singing]
[36:04] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody's praying

[36:56] me.

[38:05] Angels are watching
[38:09] over [music] me.
[38:13] There's [music and singing] many miles
[38:16] the wilderness where my pillow [singing]
[38:19] was a stone.
[38:22] And I've been [music]
[38:24] through the darkest caverns where no
[38:28] light has ever shown.
[38:31] Still [music] I went on cuz there was
[38:34] someone
[38:36] who was down [singing]
[38:38] on their knees. [music]
[38:42] And I thank you for all those people
[38:45] praying
[38:47] all [singing] those times [music]
[38:50] for me.
[38:53] Oh yeah,
[38:56] [music] somebody's [singing] praying.
[39:00] I can feel it. [singing]
[39:03] [music]
[39:05] Somebody's praying
[39:08] over me.
[39:13] Mighty hands are guiding me to [music]
[39:18] protect me from
[39:20] what I can't see. And Lord, I believe.
[39:24] [music]
[39:27] Lord, I believe. [singing]
[39:29] [music]
[39:32] Somebody's praying
[39:35] for [music and singing] me.
[39:37] Well, I've walked. Oh, will I walk
[39:40] [music] the barren wilderness
[39:44] where my pillow was a stone
[39:48] [music] and I feel through [singing] the
[39:51] darkest cows where no light is ever
[39:55] shown. till I went on [music]
[39:59] cuz there was someone who was down on
[40:03] their knees.
[40:06] [music]
[40:07] And I thank you for all [singing] those
[40:09] people praying all those times
[40:15] [music] for [singing] me.
[40:18] Oh,
[40:21] [music] somebody's praying.
[40:24] I [singing] can feel it. Oh yeah.
[40:30] Somebody's [music]
[40:30] praying
[40:32] over [singing] me.
[40:36] [music]
[40:38] Mighty hands are guiding me
[40:41] to protect me [music] from what I can't
[40:45] see.
[40:47] And Lord, I believe.
[40:51] [music]
[40:52] Lord, [singing]
[40:53] I believe
[40:56] [music]
[40:57] somebody's praying
[41:00] for me. [singing]
[41:04] [music]
[41:10] [applause]
[41:33] grateful not only for the mercy of the
[41:35] Lord,
[41:37] but I'm grateful for a praying church
[41:40] family. Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Not just this four walls here, but
[41:45] people around the world that pray for us
[41:48] in the time of need and trouble. I know
[41:51] people make it without it. I just
[41:54] honestly don't know how they do.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; But they live every day without God in
[41:58] their life. They live every day without
[42:01] a praying family that's praying for
[42:03] them. But how we appreciate prayers of
[42:06] the saints of God, don't we? help us
[42:08] through so many various things that we
[42:10] go through in life.
[42:13] What a privilege it's been for us in
[42:15] 2025.
[42:17] Some of you may went down for the third
[42:19] time. You know, you went under water and
[42:21] you come back up and you went back down.
[42:22] You come back up and you went back down.
[42:24] You come back up. You think, "Oh Lord,
[42:25] am I going to make it?" And guess what?
[42:28] You made it.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Here you are, the last day of 25. I
[42:32] personally hope they don't see the end
[42:34] of another year.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope the Lord comes. But if he
[42:38] does, we're still going to be
[42:39] victorious. Are we not?
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; As the people of God. Amen. It's great
[42:44] privilege for us to be together tonight.
[42:46] No place I'd rather be on the last night
[42:48] of the year than me being a church.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Turn with me if you
[42:52] would tonight to the book of Isaiah,
[42:53] chapter 14, verse 12. We've been
[42:57] speaking about the [clears throat] the
[42:59] bride's diary.
[43:01] The diary was given to the bride by her
[43:05] father to equip her for her new life to
[43:11] the man that she's going to be married
[43:12] to is also going to be part of her in
[43:15] inheritance.
[43:17] So believers are given gifts by our
[43:20] heavenly father to equip us for our new
[43:25] life and also for our journey. So, we
[43:29] have a new life here by the baptism of
[43:32] the Holy Ghost, a new walk with God,
[43:34] Christian life, and then we're also in a
[43:37] journey into that great heavenly city
[43:40] where there will be no sorrow, sadness,
[43:42] death, and all that. So when we open up
[43:45] the treasure chest and we look inside
[43:48] the chest that the father's given us as
[43:52] um Rebecca would have done when Elizer
[43:55] was sent to her and an angel of God for
[43:58] his coming and moved on her heart. So
[44:02] when we open the lid of our treasure
[44:05] chest and we look inside and we see all
[44:08] these wonderful things that our father
[44:10] has given to us. Now some of them may
[44:13] bring immediate joy. Some of them we
[44:16] look at them and we may not quite
[44:18] understand them. Others of them we look
[44:21] at them and we know by their presence
[44:25] that
[44:27] difficult times are going to be ahead.
[44:30] Because the father don't give you just
[44:32] anything without reason or purpose or
[44:35] motive or objective. Tonight, one of the
[44:39] things we're going to look at, and we've
[44:40] been looking at it for a few services,
[44:42] is with the angels of God. So, the
[44:45] angels of the Lord, our heavenly father
[44:48] has placed them along our journey to
[44:51] help us, but it's also a sign that we
[44:55] definitely are going to need them
[44:58] because they're not here just to
[45:00] decorate. They're not here just for you
[45:02] to look at, but they're here because
[45:04] your journey is going to need angelic
[45:08] visitation, angelic help.
[45:11] So, with that being said, let's read
[45:13] Isaiah 14:12.
[45:17] How art thou fallen
[45:20] from heaven,
[45:22] oh Lucifer,
[45:25] son of the morning. Look at the meaning
[45:29] of the word Lucifer.
[45:31] The Hebrew word there is
[45:34] hel. Hel
[45:37] which is very close to one of the names
[45:40] for God in the Hebrew. Hel. Now look at
[45:44] the meaning of the word lightbearer,
[45:50] shining one,
[45:53] morning star.
[45:56] Wow.
[45:58] So Lucifer, that name means
[46:02] lightbringer,
[46:03] shining one, morning star.
[46:08] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[46:10] Lucifer? Notice what Isaiah calls him,
[46:14] son of the morning.
[46:18] How art thou cut down to the ground,
[46:20] which did weaken the nations?
[46:25] For thou hast said in thine heart. Now
[46:28] notice where sin began. It didn't begin
[46:30] on the earth. Wasn't drinking, smoking,
[46:34] lying, adultery, fornication,
[46:36] television. It wasn't any of that. But
[46:39] it actually begins right here. Now watch
[46:42] it. For thou hast said in thine heart,
[46:47] notice these two things that he's going
[46:49] to say over and over and over again. I
[46:56] will.
[46:58] I will
[47:00] ascend.
[47:03] Look at the Hebrew word
[47:05] Allah.
[47:11] Allah.
[47:14] In case you're still wondering where
[47:15] Islam come from.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Allah.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; That's the name of their God.
[47:24] Allah
[47:26] &gt;&gt; ascend
[47:28] to go up climb to go up go up over
[47:36] go up over. So you're going to try to go
[47:40] over something or someone
[47:46] &gt;&gt; to go up over to extend of boundary.
[47:51] Now, this is what Allah means and this
[47:54] is what Islam wants to do. They'll never
[47:57] be allowed to do it, but this is what
[47:59] they want to do. They want to conquer
[48:01] the world,
[48:02] &gt;&gt; but they'll never be allowed to do it.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Notice what it means.
[48:07] Extend of boundary to be exalted to lift
[48:13] oneself.
[48:15] So, Allah wants to be greater than the
[48:19] Almighty.
[48:21] But he never will be.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. For thou has said in
[48:27] thine heart, I will ascend into heaven.
[48:32] I will. Again, notice his words. I will
[48:37] exalt my. So, it's all about I and me
[48:42] and mine and my.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Can't you see why God hates that thing
[48:48] when it gets on his children?
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Don't you see where this comes from?
[48:53] &gt;&gt; From the devil.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; I will exalt my throne.
[48:59] You say he's got one. He sure does. And
[49:02] he's worshiped by billions of people in
[49:04] this earth.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; I will exalt my throne above the stars
[49:13] of God. Look with me at the meaning of
[49:15] this word kokab which means of Messiah's
[49:21] brothers.
[49:24] Huh? How in the world did the devil know
[49:28] the Messiah
[49:30] was going to have brothers?
[49:34] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[49:38] of Messiah's brothers.
[49:41] numerous progeny
[49:45] personification
[49:47] of God's omniscience.
[49:52] Now, this is what his sons are,
[49:55] personification
[49:57] of God's omnitions.
[50:00] And the devil said, "That's perfectly
[50:02] fine. You've got boys, you got sons, you
[50:06] got a church. I'll exalt myself above
[50:09] them and I'll rise above you.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Well, he's doing a lot of bragging,
[50:16] ain't he?
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Well, I guess y'all know so far he ain't
[50:20] done it.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; And I hate to disappoint him. Well, no,
[50:25] not really. He ain't never going to.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Now, notice, I will exalt myself above
[50:30] the stars of God. again his famous
[50:32] words, I will
[50:35] sit [snorts] upon the mount
[50:39] of the congregation. Now, wait a minute.
[50:41] Ain't that what we call people who go to
[50:44] church?
[50:46] Of course, I guess if you don't believe
[50:47] in going to church, then you're not
[50:49] called this. You're stay homers.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; I will sit also upon the mount. Notice
[50:59] what he wants as his own. The mount of
[51:04] the congregation.
[51:07] Again, look at the meaning of the word
[51:09] congregation.
[51:10] Appointed place, appointed time,
[51:15] meeting,
[51:16] sacred
[51:18] season,
[51:19] set [snorts]
[51:20] feast
[51:22] or a tent
[51:24] of meeting. So the devil wants a tent
[51:28] meeting.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Now what you notice? He don't say
[51:35] nothing about a honky tonk, a bar,
[51:39] a brothel,
[51:41] &gt;&gt; a house of prostitution.
[51:44] He wants the congregation.
[51:47] And notice what direction he wants them
[51:50] in the sides of the north.
[51:54] the north.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Now remember, he went to the north side
[51:59] of heaven and preached to the angels and
[52:03] deceived them. Now notice what he goes
[52:06] on to say in the congregation in the
[52:09] sides of the north. And I will again I
[52:14] will ascend above the heights [snorts]
[52:18] of the clouds. I will be like
[52:23] the most high.
[52:28] Yet, ah, I love verse 15.
[52:34] Yet
[52:35] thou shalt be brought down to hell
[52:41] &gt;&gt; to the sides of the pit.
[52:45] Now, he wanted the sides of the north,
[52:48] but he gets the sides of the pit.
[52:54] [laughter]
[52:55] &gt;&gt; And they that see thee
[52:59] shall narrowly
[53:01] look
[53:03] upon thee, and consider thee,
[53:08] saying,
[53:10] Is this the man?
[53:13] Not the God,
[53:16] not the great Allah, not the great
[53:18] mighty one. Is this the man? I want to
[53:22] be part of this verse right here one of
[53:24] these days.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to look down on him and
[53:27] say, "You mean that is what caused so
[53:31] much trouble.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; That was what caused all this issues
[53:36] around the world. Is this the man?" What
[53:41] humiliation
[53:42] that the elect of God will not look to
[53:45] him and honor him as a mighty one, but
[53:48] say he is less than a god.
[53:53] Is this the man that made the earth to
[53:56] tremble? THAT DID SHAKE KINGDOMS,
[54:01] that made the world as a wilderness,
[54:06] and destroyed the cities thereof, that
[54:09] open not the house
[54:12] of his prisoners.
[54:15] Wow.
[54:17] And may to be remembered tonight as we
[54:19] pray.
[54:21] Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight
[54:23] for this opportunity, Lord, that's been
[54:26] given to us. With the songs that we've
[54:28] sang, with the reading of the scripture,
[54:31] we could close now in prayer and say,
[54:34] "It's been good to be in the house of
[54:37] the Lord." But we feel like you have
[54:40] something you want to say to us tonight,
[54:43] Lord.
[54:44] So, we open our hearts.
[54:47] May our hearts be fertile ground, Lord
[54:51] God, that your presence, your spirit may
[54:56] sew seeds and bring forth a harvest, a
[55:01] crop, the progeny of the Messiah's
[55:05] brothers.
[55:07] We know that your kingdom is under an
[55:11] onslaught by this enemy that we have
[55:14] read about tonight. But we read the last
[55:18] book of the Bible and we know we win and
[55:23] we know he is a loser.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; For that we're thankful tonight. Father,
[55:30] you see this prayer cloth that I have in
[55:32] my hand for one of the sisters here in
[55:34] our church, Lord, that has a need in her
[55:37] body. And you know exactly what it is,
[55:39] Father. And I'm just believing you
[55:42] tonight in the name of Jesus. May this
[55:45] situation come normal, dear God. Grant
[55:49] it. Speak to us from your word, Father,
[55:52] in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints
[55:54] said,
[55:55] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[56:03] &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you as just a man,
[56:09] I would be quite afraid
[56:13] to meet such a being that we have just
[56:17] read about.
[56:19] A being that stood at the right hand of
[56:24] God.
[56:26] a being that was actually God's
[56:29] right-hand man to fellowship.
[56:34] A being that was like God except he
[56:39] couldn't create. So he's not omnipotent,
[56:42] does not have omnipresence, lots of
[56:45] things that he does not have, but he
[56:47] does have the desire to be like God. and
[56:52] even made this proclamation
[56:56] before God himself. I want you to know,
[56:59] God, I'm going to be like you,
[57:03] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to have a throne, and I
[57:05] will exalt my throne above your boys,
[57:09] your sons, and I will wind up with the
[57:13] congregation in the sides of the north.
[57:17] I will be like you, God.
[57:21] So he wants to be like God. He desires
[57:27] to be like God. So he has no beings to
[57:32] help carry this out because he's not
[57:36] omnipotent on the mission. He cannot be
[57:40] at all places at one time. He can only
[57:43] be in one place at one time.
[57:46] So he needs something to help him carry
[57:50] out this worldwide
[57:53] desire.
[57:54] Now, Satan wanted to be like God and it
[57:57] caused sin. But we read about another
[58:00] man in the Bible that was a man after
[58:03] God's own heart and God give him credit
[58:06] for it. Isn't it amazing? One being
[58:09] wants to be like God out of selfishness.
[58:12] Another one wants to be like God out to
[58:15] bring glory and honor to God. And God
[58:18] testifies of that great desire. Look how
[58:21] close right and wrong really are.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; So this being raises up. Now sin
[58:29] actually began here and we know the
[58:30] prophet tells us that that the angels
[58:33] actually fell before the foundation of
[58:37] the world. So this was in the
[58:39] pre-atomite state before the world was
[58:43] ever brought into existence, the world
[58:45] as we know it. And it was there in that
[58:48] heavenly realms and we don't know how
[58:50] many spheres that there was of course
[58:53] cherubam, seraraphims, zoons, angels of
[58:57] different degree. And we know that Paul
[59:01] breaks also into this same Romans 2
[59:03] Corinthians chapter 11 verse 13. if
[59:06] you'd like to read with me. And he said,
[59:08] "For such are false apostles,
[59:12] deceitful workers,
[59:15] transforming themselves
[59:18] into the apostles
[59:22] of Christ."
[59:25] Now listen, this same anointing
[59:29] that started out in heaven by the time
[59:31] the apostolic age comes on the earth. 2
[59:35] Corinthians written around 60- 62 AD. So
[59:39] by now on the earth, the devil has
[59:42] already started mimicking the work of
[59:45] God. Now he was not the first one to
[59:47] have apostles. God was. But after Jesus
[59:51] chose apostles, the devil said, "That's
[59:54] a great idea." So what did he do? He
[59:57] started having apostles, too. Jesus
[1:00:00] started having pastors, and the devil
[1:00:02] said, "That's a tremendous idea. I'm
[1:00:04] going to have them, too." Now watch, for
[1:00:07] such are false apostles. You see, they
[1:00:11] never had to use these terms together,
[1:00:14] false apostles, for several years,
[1:00:17] because Satan was learning the new
[1:00:20] program of God, and he didn't know what
[1:00:22] it was going to be like. So, he's
[1:00:24] watching as God unfolds in the New
[1:00:27] Testament age. And after he does it,
[1:00:29] then he goes right back to the very same
[1:00:31] thing that he did in the Garden of Eden.
[1:00:33] And that was to bring forth a twin which
[1:00:37] would mirror the original work of God.
[1:00:40] God called them apostles. Satan said,
[1:00:42] "I'll have false apostles." God had true
[1:00:44] men of God. Satan will have false men of
[1:00:46] God. God will have a church. Satan will
[1:00:48] have a church. So he just twin whatever
[1:00:51] that God did. Now watch how Paul said,
[1:00:54] "For such are false apostles deceitful
[1:00:57] workers." But I want you to notice what
[1:00:59] he says about these people that they are
[1:01:01] workers. Man, they work and work and
[1:01:04] work and work and work. But they're
[1:01:06] deceitful workers. You see, they're
[1:01:10] working, working all the time, doing
[1:01:11] something, doing something, doing
[1:01:13] something, doing something. But they've
[1:01:14] got a motive and an objective that is
[1:01:18] deceitful. And yet, it's amazing how
[1:01:21] many times workers like this will get
[1:01:23] inside a church or a family or a move of
[1:01:26] God. And boy, the people will flock to
[1:01:28] them and flock around them like crazy
[1:01:30] and they think they're the greatest
[1:01:32] people that ever was because they're all
[1:01:33] the time working, working, working,
[1:01:35] working, doing this and that and the
[1:01:37] other. But there's a motive about them
[1:01:39] that isn't just quite right.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the amazing part about this
[1:01:45] verse to me. transforming
[1:01:48] themselves,
[1:01:50] transforming
[1:01:52] themselves into the apostles of Christ.
[1:01:56] How is that possible?
[1:01:58] Now, right over here next to our
[1:02:00] pavilion, just right outside the door,
[1:02:02] we've got this substation. Now, some of
[1:02:05] the brothers here in Electric could tell
[1:02:06] you a whole lot more about it than I
[1:02:07] can, but I do know a little bit about
[1:02:10] transformers. And transformers have the
[1:02:12] ability to send certain voltage into one
[1:02:15] side of it and it can either step it up
[1:02:19] or it can take it down. Now, some of
[1:02:22] these things up here on the platform,
[1:02:24] you plug them into a 110 outlet and then
[1:02:27] they have a built-in transformer on the
[1:02:29] inside of it and it will reduce it to 3
[1:02:32] volts, 12 volts, 9 volts, however the
[1:02:35] manufacturer decide to make it. And it
[1:02:38] has the ability. Now, if you plug that
[1:02:40] 12 volt inside of this 110, it's going
[1:02:44] to blow it all to pieces and fire is
[1:02:45] going to fly everywhere. But the
[1:02:47] transformer is able to change it into
[1:02:51] low voltage. Well, you can also put in
[1:02:54] certain voltage into a substation and it
[1:02:57] will come out multiplied, goes in
[1:02:59] several hundreds, come out thousands on
[1:03:02] the other side. Now, that's what
[1:03:03] transforming does. But these people
[1:03:06] actually have the ability to transform
[1:03:11] themselves
[1:03:13] into the apostles of Christ.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Transforming themselves into. NOW, ARE
[1:03:23] they actually going in devils and coming
[1:03:27] out real apostles on the other side? No.
[1:03:31] But they look so real THAT PAUL SETS
[1:03:34] forth the analogy as if though these
[1:03:38] people they're false apostles are
[1:03:40] deceitful workers but YET THEY COME OUT
[1:03:43] on the other side of this transformation
[1:03:46] and many people will perceive that they
[1:03:49] are true genuine apostles. Now notice in
[1:03:52] verse 14, and no marvel, for Satan
[1:03:56] himself is transformed
[1:04:02] into an angel
[1:04:05] of light.
[1:04:08] SO, SATAN, THE DEVIL, THE CAUSE OF ALL
[1:04:13] SIN AND WICKEDNESS and evil, can
[1:04:16] actually transform himself and appear as
[1:04:21] an angel of light. Ah, so this helps me
[1:04:26] see when I open the lid of our little
[1:04:28] treasure box from our father and I look
[1:04:31] on the inside and there's angels. This
[1:04:35] helps me to understand why I NOT ONLY
[1:04:38] NEED THE Bible and I not only need the
[1:04:41] prophets tapes and I not only need a
[1:04:44] pastor and an evangelist and a teacher
[1:04:47] and a church and the church said
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; but I also need angels that will help me
[1:04:54] to be able to discern the difference
[1:04:57] between true apostles and false ones
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; because they will be so close it would
[1:05:04] deceive the very elected if it were
[1:05:08] possible. SO THEN SATAN can actually
[1:05:11] transform himself into an angel of
[1:05:17] light. NOTICE AGAIN, THEREFORE IT IS NO
[1:05:20] great thing if read these words.
[1:05:26] Yes.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; What
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; you mean the devil
[1:05:32] has preachers
[1:05:34] that are called his ministers?
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:05:42] His ministers also be transformed as
[1:05:47] [screaming]
[1:05:49] the ministers OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. BUT WHAT
[1:05:51] IS THE TRANSFORMER?
[1:05:53] WHAT IS IT THAT FALSE preachers can run
[1:05:57] through some type of spiritual
[1:06:00] transformation
[1:06:02] and THEY WILL COME OUT ON THE OTHER side
[1:06:04] of that transformer and actually deceive
[1:06:08] good, genuine, sincere people
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY LOOK SO REAL. THEY CAN
[1:06:16] SOUND so real and they can be so close
[1:06:20] they would deceive the very elected
[1:06:24] if it were possible.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; "THEREFORE, IT IS NO GREAT THING IF his
[1:06:31] ministers ALSO BE TRANSFORMED as the
[1:06:36] ministers of
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Wow. You mean they can run through the
[1:06:41] transformer and come out on the other
[1:06:44] SIDE AND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE looking at
[1:06:46] a minister of righteousness and he's in
[1:06:48] this one category and you see another
[1:06:50] preaching boy you know he's straight
[1:06:52] from hell because he does this that and
[1:06:54] other. No, YOU SEE ONCE THEY RUN THROUGH
[1:06:58] A SUPERNATURAL power of transformation,
[1:07:01] don't you understand what that is?
[1:07:04] Demons. Oh,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; fallen
[1:07:08] angels.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; And a religious devil is seven times
[1:07:13] worse than any other devil.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; So, A DEMON CAN ACTUALLY PULL a preacher
[1:07:23] through the transforming. Now, thank God
[1:07:25] all preachers don't go through that.
[1:07:28] Even all non-bride preachers won't. But
[1:07:32] for those who will yield themsel and
[1:07:35] give their gift, their ability to talk
[1:07:37] or whatever more that they will yield to
[1:07:40] the I will. They will yield to I want
[1:07:44] this and I want that and I want to be
[1:07:46] big. And they're constantly moving and
[1:07:50] looking beyond the boundary of what God
[1:07:53] assigned to them by predestination.
[1:07:56] But it's never enough. IT'S NEVER
[1:07:59] ENOUGH. THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT TO BE BIGGER.
[1:08:01] THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT TO BE GREATER.
[1:08:03] THEY'VE GOT TO BE BIGGER than this man.
[1:08:04] Their church has got to be bigger.
[1:08:06] They'll steal. They'll lie. They'll
[1:08:08] cheat. They do whatever they have to do
[1:08:10] in order to make themselves greater and
[1:08:13] bigger.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; They just cannot stand their assigned
[1:08:17] boundaries.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Don't you see, friend? Yes, sir.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; That's of the devil.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:08:28] How many wants to say where God put you?
[1:08:31] I don't care if it's this big around.
[1:08:33] I'd rather have that and be in the will
[1:08:35] of God than be something 10,000 times
[1:08:38] bigger and be totally after the devil.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. THEREFORE, IT IS NO GREAT thing
[1:08:44] if his ministers also be TRANSFORMED AS
[1:08:47] THE MINISTERS of righteousness whose end
[1:08:52] shall be according to their works. Now
[1:08:57] look in Revelation 12:3. And there
[1:08:59] appeared another wonder in heaven. And
[1:09:01] behold, a great red dragon, great red
[1:09:06] dragon, having seven heads and 10 horns,
[1:09:10] and seven crowns upon his heads. And his
[1:09:15] tail drew a third part of the stars of
[1:09:19] heaven. Now remember the prophet in 1957
[1:09:23] when he was talking about the scripture
[1:09:25] and he said it was not that the devil
[1:09:28] had a long tale but it was the t a l e
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; that he told those stars.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch. AND HE DID CAST them to
[1:09:41] the earth and THE DRAGON STOOD BEFORE
[1:09:43] THE woman which was ready to be
[1:09:45] delivered for to devour her child as
[1:09:48] soon as it was born. Of course, the
[1:09:49] woman was Israel and the child was the
[1:09:52] Lord Jesus. Now, let's look back at this
[1:09:55] realm of the angels in second Peter 2:4.
[1:10:00] For if God spared not the angels that
[1:10:03] sinned, Lord have mercy, children, can
[1:10:06] you imagine these words? Angels that
[1:10:10] sin. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEINGS THAT
[1:10:12] WERE NOT BORN like we were. They were
[1:10:15] not born lost. They were not BORN OF
[1:10:18] SINFUL PARENTS. They were created holy,
[1:10:21] created righteous, created in the
[1:10:24] presence of God to live in a realm
[1:10:27] that's beyond what our minds no doubt
[1:10:29] can even comprehend. BUT THEN PETER
[1:10:32] SAYS, "FOR GOD SPARED not the angels
[1:10:34] that sinned, but cast them down to
[1:10:38] [screaming]
[1:10:40] hell."
[1:10:43] Now listen, I know it's the same English
[1:10:45] word as what you might think is Hades,
[1:10:47] but it's tartaro.
[1:10:50] Tartaro,
[1:10:52] THE DEEPEST abyss
[1:10:55] of Hades, the name of the subterranean
[1:11:00] region, DOULFUL
[1:11:02] AND DARK. SO GOD DELIVERED them now, not
[1:11:05] just into Hades, but into the deepest
[1:11:09] realm of the abyss.
[1:11:13] Now, are they on THE EARTH? OF COURSE
[1:11:15] THEY ARE. Are they STILL ACCUSING US
[1:11:17] BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD? THEY ARE. BUT
[1:11:20] THEY'RE SOULS.
[1:11:22] THEY'RE SOULS.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN THE ABYSS
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; AND CAN never be redeemed.
[1:11:32] THIS IS WHY THEY WALK THROUGH DRY places
[1:11:35] seeking rest.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; They are tormented creatures.
[1:11:42] NOTICE HE CAST THEM DOWN TO HELL and
[1:11:45] delivered them
[1:11:47] oh God into chains OF DARKNESS WHICH IS
[1:11:52] MIST OR BLACKNESS USED OF the darkness
[1:11:56] of the nether world. SO THIS IS WHERE
[1:12:01] THEY'VE been delivered to into the realm
[1:12:03] or the sphere of darkness. Now I want
[1:12:07] you to notice that Peter when he talked
[1:12:09] about this him and Jude wrote several
[1:12:12] things that was very similar when it
[1:12:14] come to the realms of the regions of the
[1:12:16] lost. Jude in verse 6 he says and the
[1:12:19] angels WHICH KEPT NOT THEIR FIRST estate
[1:12:23] but left their own habitation he hath
[1:12:27] reserved in everlasting chains under
[1:12:31] darkness unto the judgment of the great
[1:12:34] day. And the word estate is is
[1:12:36] principality
[1:12:38] or it is IT IS THE BEGINNING OR the
[1:12:41] commencement
[1:12:43] AND THAT WHICH SURPASSES ALL others in
[1:12:47] position and point of rank and honor and
[1:12:53] preeminence AND DIGNITY. SO THESE beings
[1:12:57] that Peter is referring to and Jude IS
[1:13:00] REFERRING TO WERE NOT BEINGS THAT WERE,
[1:13:03] YOU KNOW, SLITHERING UP OUT OF HELL AND
[1:13:05] my they were breathing fire AND THEY
[1:13:07] WERE HORRIBLE. THAT'S WHAT THEY BECOME.
[1:13:10] THAT'S NOT what they were in the
[1:13:12] beginning.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE OF dignity
[1:13:16] and rank around the throne of God. They
[1:13:20] were likened to the heavenly stars in
[1:13:23] honor and dignity. Now notice in the
[1:13:26] dignity THAT THEY DID NOT KEEP, THEY
[1:13:30] FELL FROM IT. NOW WE KNOW THAT THERE'S
[1:13:32] ACCORDING TO WHAT Paul wrote, he said
[1:13:34] that there are elect angels which of
[1:13:37] course could NOT FALL. BUT THEN THERE
[1:13:39] WERE SOME THAT FATHER BROUGHT INTO
[1:13:42] existence which would be placed on
[1:13:45] probation. They would be created in high
[1:13:49] and high rank and there would be an
[1:13:51] order of divine hierarchy and protocol
[1:13:54] and even after they would fall away or
[1:13:57] backside if you wish to say it that way
[1:13:59] from their POSITION THEY WOULD STILL
[1:14:02] maintain a rank and a hierarchy. This is
[1:14:05] why McDaniel prayed and Gabriel was sent
[1:14:08] down. We looked at it a couple weeks ago
[1:14:10] and Gabriel COULD NOT GET THROUGH
[1:14:12] BECAUSE that demon over the kingdom
[1:14:15] there WAS ACTUALLY THOUGH HE WAS
[1:14:18] BACKSLID AND FALLEN FROM GOD'S PRESENCE.
[1:14:21] AND HERE WAS THE MIGHTY ANGEL GABRIEL.
[1:14:25] BUT THIS DEMON STILL had a rank THAT WAS
[1:14:28] SO HIGH GABRIEL COULD NOT break through.
[1:14:32] AND HE SAID HE STAYED THERE WITH HIM AND
[1:14:35] WRESTLED AND FOUGHT WITH THIS THIS
[1:14:38] FALLEN ANGEL, THIS DEMON POWER until
[1:14:41] Michael, which was one OF THE CHIEF
[1:14:43] PRINCES, CAME DOWN and he took on the
[1:14:46] battle AND THEN IT SENT GABRIEL ON DOWN.
[1:14:50] NOW THINK OF THE MIGHTY ANGEL GABRIEL
[1:14:54] AND A DEMON POWER WITHTOOD HIM FOR THREE
[1:14:58] WEEKS, 21 DAYS.
[1:15:01] OH, thank God for angels along our
[1:15:04] journey.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T NO WONDER SOMETIMES WHEN YOU
[1:15:07] PRAY. ANYBODY EVER FEEL THAT WAY? When
[1:15:09] you FEEL LIKE YOUR PRAYERS DON'T GO NO
[1:15:11] HIGHER IN YOUR HEAD, YOU EVER PRAY AND
[1:15:13] ASK GOD, "GOD, PLEASE MOVE. GOD, PLEASE
[1:15:16] DO THIS. PLEASE DO THAT." AND IT FEELS
[1:15:18] LIKE GOD'S A MILLION MILES AWAY FROM
[1:15:20] YOU. ANYBODY EVER felt that way? OF
[1:15:22] COURSE YOU HAVE. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
[1:15:24] WE'RE DEALING WITH, FRIENDS? BUT DON'T
[1:15:26] BE DISCOURAGED TONIGHT. GOD STILL GOT
[1:15:29] ANGELS AND THEY'RE ON DISPATCH AND
[1:15:31] THEY'RE SENT OUT TO THE PEOPLE OF GOD IN
[1:15:34] the time of trouble. Hallelujah. You
[1:15:36] remember THE PROPHET TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:15:38] TWO WOMEN THAT COME AND THEY WENT
[1:15:40] THROUGH THE prayer line and he one of
[1:15:42] them of course had the issue with her
[1:15:44] stomach and the other one had a gorder
[1:15:46] AND HE SAID THEY KEPT ON BELIEVING, KEPT
[1:15:48] ON BELIEVING. Days went by, another day
[1:15:50] went by. You remember the story? The one
[1:15:53] cooked herself an egg and ate her kids
[1:15:55] oatmeal and all that. AND THE PROPHET
[1:15:57] TALKED about it and she run running over
[1:15:59] to her neighbor's house. AND WHEN SHE
[1:16:01] GOT INSIDE THERE, THAT SISTER of hers,
[1:16:03] SHE WAS SHAKING THE SHEETS BECAUSE THE
[1:16:06] TUMOR HAD FELL OFF. OH, glory to God.
[1:16:08] THE TUMOR HAD FELL OFF OF HER BODY. AND
[1:16:11] THE PROPHET SAID THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
[1:16:14] WAS PASSING THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD
[1:16:16] THAT MORNING. And he SAID, "IF THEY
[1:16:18] WOULD HAVE LOST THEIR FAITH, THEY WOULD
[1:16:20] NOT HAVE GOT THEIR HEALING." OH MY. AND
[1:16:23] SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT BE WITHIN AN HOUR OF
[1:16:26] YOUR DELIVERANCE AND YOU'LL GIVE UP. OR
[1:16:28] YOU MIGHT BE WITHIN A DAY OR TWO DAYS.
[1:16:31] DON'T YOU GIVE UP. I DON'T CARE HOW HARD
[1:16:34] YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT. YOU KEEP RIGHT ON
[1:16:36] FIGHTING.
[1:16:38] HALLELUJAH. THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE STILL
[1:16:41] ON DISPATCH TO THE SAINTS OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, help us. SO THEY WERE
[1:16:50] CREATED in perfect holiness and
[1:16:54] righteousness AND IN THE IN THEIR
[1:16:56] NATURE. There was a dignity and an honor
[1:16:59] that was given to them, DOMINIONS AND
[1:17:01] PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS. PAUL uses
[1:17:04] this, of course, in Ephesians and
[1:17:05] Philippians and a couple different
[1:17:07] places in THE NEW TESTAMENT. THEY BEHELD
[1:17:10] THE FACE OF ELOHIM. THEY STOOD RIGHT
[1:17:14] BEFORE THAT GREAT BRILLIANT LIGHT. THEY
[1:17:18] WALKED INTO HIS PRESENCE UPON HIM. THEY
[1:17:22] WALKED INTO HIS PRESENCE AND SAW THE THE
[1:17:26] CHRIST OF GOD, THE VISIBLE APPEARANCE OF
[1:17:30] THE INVISIBLE GOD. THEY STOOD THERE IN
[1:17:32] HIS PRESENCE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG, AND
[1:17:35] YET MADE a choice to turn and go away
[1:17:39] from him.
[1:17:41] NOTICE JUDE GOES ON TO SAY, "AND THE
[1:17:44] ANGELS WHICH KEPT NOT THEIR FIRST
[1:17:46] ESTATE, BUT LEFT their own habitation."
[1:17:50] THEIR OWN HABITATION. And the word
[1:17:52] rendered for habitation, it means THAT
[1:17:54] HEAVEN WAS THEIR NATIVE abode or THEIR
[1:17:58] DWELLING PLACE AND THEY LEFT IT BY SIN
[1:18:01] AND THEY BECAME dissatisfied
[1:18:05] with what God had given them. Are you
[1:18:07] kidding me?
[1:18:09] YOU BECOME DISSATISFIED WITH PERFECTION.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; YOU BECOME DISSATISFIED WITH sinlessness
[1:18:15] and purity AND HOLINESS AND
[1:18:17] RIGHTEOUSNESS. AND YOU WANT TO BECOME A
[1:18:20] DEMON.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Lord God,
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; NOTICE SO THEY BECOME DISSATISFIED AND
[1:18:29] THEIR ABODE AND ON ON THE VOLUNTARY
[1:18:32] BASIS THEY WALKED AWAY FROM THEIR
[1:18:36] POSITION.
[1:18:37] DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND FRIENDS? THIS IS
[1:18:39] THE BATTLE OF YOUR WAR OF YOUR LIFE.
[1:18:41] WHEN YOU BECOME A CHILD OF GOD, IT'S FOR
[1:18:44] STAYING IN YOUR PLACE.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; STAYING IN YOUR PLACE IN CHRIST JESUS.
[1:18:50] STAYING IN THE PLACE THAT GOD'S ORDAINED
[1:18:52] YOU TO BE. OH, I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD
[1:18:54] PREACH WITH ME TONIGHT. AND SATAN WILL
[1:18:56] DO EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD HE CAN. IF
[1:18:58] GOD'S ORDAINED YOU TO COME TO THIS
[1:19:00] CHURCH, THE DEVIL WILL DO EVERYTHING HE
[1:19:02] CAN TO keep you AWAY FROM IT. HE'LL TELL
[1:19:04] YOU PEOPLE DON'T LOVE YOU. PEOPLE DON'T
[1:19:06] LIKE YOU. THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER.
[1:19:08] COME ON, SOMEBODY. IF YOU BELONG AMONGST
[1:19:10] A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO FELLOWSHIP WITH
[1:19:12] THEM AND HE SAY THEY DON'T LIKE YOU.
[1:19:14] They don't want YOU HERE. DON'T YOU
[1:19:15] UNDERSTAND? HE'S TRYING TO DO TO YOU
[1:19:17] WHAT HE WOUND UP DOING TO THESE ANGELS.
[1:19:20] HE TALKED THEM RIGHT OUT OF THEIR
[1:19:22] POSITION AND HE PREACHED TO THEM AND
[1:19:24] TOLD THEM, "LOOK, GOD DON'T NEED YOU.
[1:19:26] GOD DON'T LOVE YOU. GOD DON'T WANT YOU.
[1:19:28] YOU NEED TO REBEL AGAINST HIM. YOU NEED
[1:19:30] TO LEAVE. I I'M FIXING TO START ANOTHER
[1:19:32] GROUP OVER HERE. I'M GONNA START ANOTHER
[1:19:34] CONGREGATION. AND Y'ALL WANT TO COME AND
[1:19:35] JOIN TONIGHT?
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; BY ATTEMPTING TO RISE HIGHER,
[1:19:46] or so THEY THOUGHT,
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; OR BY QUITTING THEIR station or their
[1:19:52] post OF DUTY,
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXALT
[1:19:57] THEMSELVES under a new headship
[1:20:01] called Lucifer.
[1:20:03] Dear God HAVE MERCY. NOW THEY ARE
[1:20:07] RESERVED IN chains of darkness.
[1:20:11] Lord Jesus keep us father. NOTICE IN
[1:20:15] MATTHEW 25:41.
[1:20:17] THE LORD JESUS SAID, "THEN SHALL HE SAY
[1:20:20] UNTO them on the left hand, depart from
[1:20:22] me, you cursed into everlasting fire."
[1:20:26] Now the word everlasting here is anon,
[1:20:28] of course, and it means age plus age. He
[1:20:32] doesn't say eternal, but age plus age,
[1:20:35] everlasting fire prepared for THE DEVIL
[1:20:40] AND HIS ANGELS. SO THIS REALM WAS NOT
[1:20:43] EVEN MADE FOR MAN. IT WASN'T EVEN made
[1:20:46] for man in THE FIRST PLACE. BUT WHEN MAN
[1:20:48] EXALTS HIMSELF ABOVE GOD'S WORD, YOU SEE
[1:20:51] THIS IS WHY THAT GOD, EVEN THOUGH many
[1:20:53] of them are not bride and THEY'RE NOT
[1:20:55] ELECT, BUT GOD OFFERS THEM THE
[1:20:57] OPPORTUNITY TO BE SAVED AND THEY TURN IT
[1:20:59] DOWN. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, GOD SAID,
[1:21:01] "YOU'VE REJECTED my salvation. I'M
[1:21:03] OFFERING TO YOU. YOU'RE NOT EVEN ONE OF
[1:21:05] MY STARS. YOU'RE NOT EVEN ONE OF MY SONS
[1:21:08] AND DAUGHTERS. YOU'RE NOT EVEN AN
[1:21:09] ATTRIBUTE OF MINE." BUT I'M SAYING,
[1:21:11] "WHOSOEVER WILL JUST come on if you want
[1:21:13] to be delivered." THEY SAY, "NO, WE
[1:21:14] DON'T WANT to be delivered. We want TO
[1:21:16] GO TO HELL."
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; WELL, GOD SAID, "ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'S
[1:21:18] WHAT you want, THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE
[1:21:19] GOING." BUT I'M TELLING YOU, THIS PLACE
[1:21:22] WAS NOT CREATED FOR ONE HUMAN BEING. IT
[1:21:25] WAS CREATED FOR THE DEVIL, PREPARED FOR
[1:21:27] THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; But if it was created and had a
[1:21:32] beginning,
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; it also has an end.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Thank God. NOW, YOU WOULD
[1:21:40] THINK, FRIENDS, THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY
[1:21:42] HEAR THESE THINGS THAT THE FALL OF
[1:21:46] ANGELS FROM SUCH A PLACE OF preeminence
[1:21:49] would be a warning to human beings.
[1:21:53] Yeah.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Why isn't it
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; WHY IS IT THAT HUMANS WILL LISTEN TO
[1:21:59] THIS STORY AND I MEAN JUST FREAK OUT,
[1:22:01] JUST TEAR THEM ALL TO pieces and turn
[1:22:04] right around and do the same thing.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice a strange parallel.
[1:22:12] Paul in 1 Timothy chapter 3:5
[1:22:15] is talking about the office of a bishop
[1:22:19] which of course was a pastor
[1:22:22] AND PAUL IS GIVING the requirements for
[1:22:25] a BISHOP FOR IF A MAN NOT KNOW how to
[1:22:29] rule his OWN HOUSE AND HE'S TALKING
[1:22:32] ABOUT ONE of the requirements was that a
[1:22:33] pastor had to have his house subject to
[1:22:36] God not just the man but his CHILDREN
[1:22:39] HIS HOUSE BECAUSE IF HE COULDN'T RULE
[1:22:42] his own house, how could he rule the
[1:22:45] church of God? And Paul, OF COURSE, AND
[1:22:47] TITUS TALKED ABOUT THE MAN AND HE SAID
[1:22:50] THAT A PASTOR MUST BE BLAMELESS.
[1:22:53] THAT IS, YOU CANNOT SAY TRUTHFULLY THAT
[1:22:56] THIS MAN is running around with women or
[1:22:59] this man does this or this man lied or
[1:23:01] this man's done that. He's got to be a
[1:23:04] blameless position to hold that type of
[1:23:07] requirement. Is that your Bible? How
[1:23:08] many knows that your Bible? SO A MAN
[1:23:10] MUST BE BLAMELESS. AND HE SAYS, "HOW
[1:23:14] shall he take care of the CHURCH OF GOD?
[1:23:16] NOT A NOVICE." Now this is one that's
[1:23:20] immature, one that is not really
[1:23:22] developed into the right type of
[1:23:24] character and maturity that is needed
[1:23:28] for this type OF A POSITION. THIS IS why
[1:23:31] Paul says this less being lifted up
[1:23:37] with pride.
[1:23:40] Lifted up. NOTICE PAUL SAYS THIS GREEK
[1:23:44] WORD HERE TWOFOLD. HIGH MINDED
[1:23:46] METAPHORICALLY TO MAKE PROUD puff up
[1:23:50] with pride. RENDER INSULT TO BLIND
[1:23:56] WITH pride or conceit.
[1:23:59] to render foolish or stupid.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MEN THAT MOVE
[1:24:09] INTO a position like this in the strings
[1:24:12] that he uses this to describe only
[1:24:15] onefold of the five-fold ministry?
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about evangelist.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; He talking about a teacher.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Wonder why he only says this about a
[1:24:26] pastor. CUZ A PASTOR IS GOING to have a
[1:24:31] little kingdom. Sure.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And if he's not careful, he'll think
[1:24:34] it's his.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; But if he's a real servant of God, he
[1:24:38] realize it ain't his kingdom. It's his
[1:24:41] kingdom.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; And if anxious to come in and preach at
[1:24:45] his church, AND THEY SAY, "WELL, THAT'S
[1:24:46] BROTHER DONNY'S CHURCH, AND THAT'S
[1:24:48] brother so and so's church, AND THAT I
[1:24:49] UNDERSTAND WHAT people are saying when
[1:24:51] they say that, but in one way, that
[1:24:53] ain't the truth. IF THIS CHURCH IS MY
[1:24:56] CHURCH, we're in a mess of trouble.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. THIS OUGHT TO BE THE
[1:25:01] CHURCH OF THE LORD JESUS, and I am
[1:25:03] simply an undersheperd under the great
[1:25:07] shepherd himself. BUT FRIENDS, THE SAD
[1:25:09] THING ABOUT IT IS SOME PREACHERS,
[1:25:11] PASTORS THAT I'VE KNOWN, THAT'S EXACTLY
[1:25:13] the way they look at it. They are the
[1:25:14] head, they are the CEO, they are the
[1:25:17] boss.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:25:22] Not a novice less being lifted up with
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; pride.
[1:25:31] Pride
[1:25:33] he fall.
[1:25:37] I've read this ever since I've been a
[1:25:40] Christian
[1:25:42] and I never saw it until this week.
[1:25:47] lest he fall
[1:25:50] into
[1:25:51] condemnation
[1:25:54] of the devil.
[1:25:57] DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO
[1:25:58] PREACHERS NOW WHEN THEY GO TO BEING
[1:26:01] LIFTED UP IN pride and arrogance?
[1:26:05] They're repeating
[1:26:08] the same thing
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; that happened in heaven.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:26:14] THEY PLACE THEMSELVES UNDER THE
[1:26:16] CONDEMNATION,
[1:26:18] the same condemnation
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; of the devil.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE WORD CONDEMNATION. WHAT IT
[1:26:27] MEANS there judgment, DAMNATION
[1:26:32] IN a forensic sense. The sentence of A
[1:26:36] JUDGE, THE PUNISHMENT WITH WHICH ONE IS
[1:26:39] SENTENCED, PENAL JUDGMENT,
[1:26:42] SENTENCE A MATTER TO BE JUDICIALLY
[1:26:45] DECIDED, A LAWSUIT, a case in court.
[1:26:51] SO PREACHERS THAT BECOME EXALTED AND ALL
[1:26:54] LIFTED UP HIGH ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE AND
[1:26:57] ABOVE THE PEOPLE AND ON A PEDESTAL AND
[1:27:00] YOU'RE HERE TO SERVE ME, that's a life
[1:27:02] in the pits of hell. A God called man is
[1:27:05] here to serve you.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THE LORD JESUS WAS THE ONE
[1:27:11] WHO GAVE US THAT EXAMPLE. THAT'S why he
[1:27:13] washed his disciples feet. They didn't
[1:27:15] wash his.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; OH MY. NOT A NOVICE, LEST BEING LIFTED
[1:27:22] UP WITH PRIDE, HE FALL into
[1:27:26] the same the same
[1:27:29] condemnation
[1:27:31] of the devil.
[1:27:34] Wow.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; What a dangerous thing to be a preacher.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; What a dangerous thing.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; I've said it before and I'll keep saying
[1:27:49] it. If a man ain't called, it's one of
[1:27:52] the worst things that can happen to him.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. NOW, WHY WOULD an inexperienced
[1:28:02] man, you know, you know as well as I
[1:28:04] KNOW THAT THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE
[1:28:06] a novice as far as years, BUT THEY'RE A
[1:28:09] NOVICE in understanding.
[1:28:12] THEY'RE A NOVICE IN REVELATION. THEY'RE
[1:28:14] A NOVICE. WATCH THE decisions they make.
[1:28:18] AND YOU'LL SEE SOMETIMES OLDER men with
[1:28:22] novice decisions, which tells you right
[1:28:25] there, that ain't a LEADER YET. NOW, WHY
[1:28:28] A NOVICE? BECAUSE A NOVICE IS GOING TO
[1:28:32] BE weaker in knowledge and
[1:28:35] understanding, BUT THEY'LL BE STRONG IN
[1:28:39] THEIR PASSIONS. OH, I WANT TO DO THIS.
[1:28:41] OH, I WANT TO DO SOMETHING. OF COURSE,
[1:28:42] IT'S ALL FOR GOD. You know, IT'S ALL FOR
[1:28:44] GOD. OH, I OH, MAN. WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE
[1:28:47] GOT TO WE'VE GOT TO YEAH, WE'VE GOT TO
[1:28:49] got to GOT TO.
[1:28:51] AND THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR DESIRES
[1:28:53] JUST OH, I JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING. I
[1:28:55] JUST WANT TO DO something for the
[1:28:56] people.
[1:29:00] But they're immature in their graces and
[1:29:03] their virtues
[1:29:07] and they lack experience
[1:29:10] WHICH SHOULD CONSOLIDATE THEIR JUDGMENTS
[1:29:13] about matters that leaders are going to
[1:29:16] have to make.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, THEY'RE IN GREAT DANGER
[1:29:21] of selfexaltation.
[1:29:25] FOR NONE ARE SO proud
[1:29:28] as THE CONFIDENT THAT ARE ignorant and
[1:29:33] injudicious.
[1:29:36] In other words, they make stupid and
[1:29:39] foolish judgments
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; decisions of how to do this and how to
[1:29:44] do that and how to do that.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] But yet they're so proud and so
[1:29:53] arrogant. Ignorance will do that to you.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; If the more you know about the word, the
[1:29:58] bigger you feel about yourself.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure what books you're reading.
[1:30:02] But let me suggest a few for you. How
[1:30:05] can I overcome would be a good one. He
[1:30:08] that is in you would be another good
[1:30:09] one. Holy Ghost series would really be a
[1:30:12] good one.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE BIGGER WE BECOME, THE MORE
[1:30:17] DOMINANT THE GREAT GRAY. IT'S NOT THAT
[1:30:20] IT SHOULD BE. OH MY. THE LONGER WE GO IN
[1:30:23] GOD AND THE MORE WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE
[1:30:24] WORD, THE MORE IT SHOULD HUMBLE US, not
[1:30:28] exalt us.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOTICE HERE THE PROPHET SAID,
[1:30:34] "DID YOU KNOW THAT IN HEAVEN that the
[1:30:37] devil was God's right-hand man in the
[1:30:40] beginning?
[1:30:42] That Lucifer, the son of the morning,
[1:30:45] was given power. And the REASON THAT HE
[1:30:48] BROUGHT SIN INTO THE WORLD, HE WAS ABLE
[1:30:51] TO TAKE SOMETHING THAT GOD had created
[1:30:54] and perverted it back into AN EVIL THING
[1:30:58] WHICH STARTED ALL THIS TROUBLE IN THE
[1:31:01] BEGINNING. THEN GOD BACK BEFORE THE
[1:31:03] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD WAS EVER LAID
[1:31:05] WHEN HE'S SEEN WHAT SATAN DONE IN HIS
[1:31:08] PRIDE.
[1:31:10] NOW, the devil didn't GO OVER AND OPEN
[1:31:12] HEAVEN'S FIRST BAR. And he wasn't OUT
[1:31:14] THERE WORKING FOR WINSTON, you know, and
[1:31:16] say, "Hey, you want you want A
[1:31:16] CIGARETTE, ANGEL?" "YEAH, MAN. I always
[1:31:18] want to chew that tobacco." Man, a lie.
[1:31:20] Give me that amber. Oh, man. Alive.
[1:31:22] Ain't that awesome stuff running out
[1:31:24] your mouth?
[1:31:27] Pride.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Pride.
[1:31:33] IN HIS PRIDE, HE WENT OVER IN THE NORTH
[1:31:36] AND SET UP A KINGDOM AND FOUGHT against
[1:31:40] Michael. Notice now Gabriel
[1:31:46] Gabriel knew better
[1:31:49] than to attack this angel.
[1:31:54] I want you to notice in different
[1:31:56] appearances of the angels of God in the
[1:31:59] scripture whenever they would even with
[1:32:01] Moses body
[1:32:03] they wouldn't SAY IN THE NAME OF ELOHIM
[1:32:07] IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:32:09] but they would say the Lord rebuke you
[1:32:14] the Lord
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; rebuke you
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; I want you to look and see what the
[1:32:19] blood of the Lord Jesus has done in the
[1:32:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:22] for sons and daughters of God that we
[1:32:25] can lay our hands on the sick, lay our
[1:32:26] hands on those that are full of evil
[1:32:28] spirits. And we can say, "In the name of
[1:32:31] Jesus, I adure you, come out of them."
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SEE WHAT GOD HAS DONE? DON'T
[1:32:36] YOU SEE WHAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS HAS
[1:32:38] DONE? FRIENDS, FOR 2,000 YEARS, THE
[1:32:40] KINGDOM OF GOD, THAT'S WHY HELL IS TORE
[1:32:42] ALL THE PIECES BECAUSE THEY'RE SONS OF
[1:32:45] GOD BACK ON THE EARTH AGAIN THAT CAN
[1:32:48] STAND IN THE VERY POSITION THAT GOD
[1:32:50] ORDAINED THEM TO BE. THAT'S WHY THE
[1:32:52] PROPHET SAID THAT THE PRAYER OF A SON OF
[1:32:54] GOD WILL OUTWEIGH AN ANGEL MANY TIMES.
[1:32:57] WHY THE ANGEL DOES NOT HAVE THE
[1:32:59] AUTHORITY THAT A SON OF GOD DOES.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOTICE THIS. HE SAYS THE RIGHT
[1:33:09] HAND man of almighty God
[1:33:13] was Lucifer
[1:33:16] the son OF THE MORNING THE FIRST GOD
[1:33:19] GRANTED HIM ALMOST co-workers with him
[1:33:23] he was a coworker partly equal
[1:33:28] WITH HIM ONLY SATAN COULD NOT CREATE GOD
[1:33:31] IS THE ONLY CREATOR but Satan TOOK
[1:33:34] SOMETHING GOD CREATED AND PERVERTED IT
[1:33:37] back into something else evil. THEN
[1:33:41] THESE FALLEN ANGELS, THEY START WORKING
[1:33:44] IN THE REALM OF DARKNESS. But now
[1:33:47] remember, they can appear as angels of
[1:33:51] light.
[1:33:52] You remember the prophet telling us
[1:33:54] about the church age messenger, don't
[1:33:55] you? That appeared to St. Martin and he
[1:33:58] said, "Martin, I'm the Lord Jesus
[1:34:01] Christ. Worship me."
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Had a crown on his head. St. Martin
[1:34:06] looked at him, looked at him, he said,
[1:34:08] "Martin, DON'T YOU KNOW ME? FALL DOWN
[1:34:11] AND WORSHIP ME. I'M YOUR LORD AND
[1:34:13] SAVIOR."
[1:34:15] And friends, you're talking about a
[1:34:17] demon. AND THAT DEMON WOULD TAKE ON THE
[1:34:20] name and THE IDENTITY AND SAY, "I'M THE
[1:34:24] LORD JESUS." AND PEOPLE THINK JUST THE
[1:34:26] THE NAME OF JESUS is some type of
[1:34:28] magical something. DEVILS WON'T SAY IT.
[1:34:30] YOU DON'T KNOW your Bible very well. IN
[1:34:33] THAT VISION, THAT DEMON SAID HE WAS THE
[1:34:36] LORD JESUS AND SAID HE WAS HIS SAVIOR.
[1:34:40] But thank God St. Martin knew his Bible.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And he looked at him and said, "Get
[1:34:45] behind me, Satan. You got a crown on
[1:34:47] your head. The saints of God's going to
[1:34:49] crown the Lord Jesus." And that he SAID,
[1:34:51] "BOY, WOULDN'T THAT BEEN PENTECOSTAL
[1:34:53] BAIT? I'VE SHARED WITH YOU MANY
[1:34:55] DIFFERENT TIMES through the years that
[1:34:56] Carol and I AS WELL KNEW A WOMAN BACK IN
[1:34:59] PENTECOST AND AN ANGEL." SHE SAID AN
[1:35:02] ANGEL OF GOD WALKED IN HER BEDROOM ONE
[1:35:04] night and HER HUSBAND WAS THERE IN WITH
[1:35:07] HER IN THE BED AND WOKE HER UP. THIS
[1:35:09] ANGEL DID AND HANDED HER A BIBLE AND
[1:35:13] TOLD HER SHE WAS CALLED TO PREACH GOD'S
[1:35:16] WORD.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; AND THAT ANGEL DISAPPEARED AND LEFT THAT
[1:35:22] BIBLE IN THE ROOM. IT WAS NOT THEIR
[1:35:24] BIBLE. IT WAS NOT A BIBLE THAT THEY HAD
[1:35:27] IN THE HOUSE. IT WAS NOT A BIBLE THAT
[1:35:30] ANYBODY EVEN KNEW where it come from.
[1:35:33] You know what that woman done? Started
[1:35:37] preaching.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; WHY? SHE TOOK AN EXPERIENCE
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; over God's word.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; AN EXPERIENCE OVER GOD'S WORD INSTEAD OF
[1:35:52] JUDGING THAT DEMON. WHAT WAS IT, BROTHER
[1:35:55] MATTHEW? IT WAS A DEMON STRAIGHT FROM
[1:35:57] THE PITS OF HELL. BUT HE WASN'T
[1:35:59] BREATHING FIRE AND HAD A BIG LONG DRAGON
[1:36:01] TAIL. HE HAD A BIBLE. [screaming]
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; YOU IMAGINE A DEMON
[1:36:09] with a Bible.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:36:20] [sighs]
[1:36:23] Luke 22:53. Jesus says, "When I was
[1:36:27] daily with you in the temple, you
[1:36:30] stretched forth no hands against me, but
[1:36:33] this is your hour
[1:36:36] and the power of darkness."
[1:36:39] John 3:19, "And this is the condemnation
[1:36:41] that light has come into the world. Men
[1:36:44] love darkness rather than light because
[1:36:48] their deeds were evil." St. John 8:12,
[1:36:51] then spake Jesus again to them, saying,
[1:36:53] I am the light of the world, and he that
[1:36:55] followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
[1:36:58] but shall have the light of life.
[1:37:02] John 12:46, I am come a light into the
[1:37:05] world, that whosoever believeth on me
[1:37:07] should not abide abide. DO YOU
[1:37:10] UNDERSTAND? THAT'S WHERE we were before
[1:37:13] he got a hold of our hearts.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; We were in that realm. Can't you can't
[1:37:18] YOU SEE THE PEOPLE of the world why
[1:37:19] they're doing WHAT THEY'RE DOING? WHY
[1:37:21] THEY'VE GONE INSANE? WHY THEY'RE CRAZY?
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; WHY? They live darkness. They eat
[1:37:26] darkness. They drink darkness. They talk
[1:37:27] about darkness. THEIR WHOLE LIFE IS
[1:37:29] CONSUMMATED IN A SPHERE OF DARKNESS. AND
[1:37:31] WE LOOK AT THEM AND THINK, "WHAT IN THE
[1:37:32] WORLD'S THE MATTER WITH THEM?" AND THEY
[1:37:34] IN THE DARKNESS LOOK AT US AND SAY,
[1:37:35] "THEY'RE A BUNCH OF FANATICS."
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THEY LOOK AT US AND THEY THINK
[1:37:39] THEY'RE CRAZY.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Romans 13:12, "The night is far spent.
[1:37:46] THE DAY IS AT HAND. LET US THEREFORE
[1:37:49] CAST OFF THE WORKS OF darkness
[1:37:52] and let us put on the armor of light. 2
[1:37:57] CORINTHIANS 4:6. FOR GOD WHO COMMANDED
[1:37:59] THE LIGHT TO SHINE OUT OF DARKNESS.
[1:38:02] AMEN. HATH SHINED IN OUR hearts to give
[1:38:06] the light of the KNOWLEDGE OF THE GLORY
[1:38:09] OF God in the face of Jesus Christ. 2
[1:38:14] CORINTHIANS 6:14. BE YOU NOT UNEQUALLY
[1:38:16] YOLKED WITH UNBELIEVERS? FOR WHAT
[1:38:18] FELLOWSHIP HATH RIGHTEOUSNESS WITH
[1:38:20] UNRIGHTEOUS? WHAT COMMUNION hath light
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; WITH DARKNESS? EPHESIANS 5'8. FOR YE
[1:38:28] WERE [screaming]
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES DARKNESS,
[1:38:32] BUT NOW
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; ARE YE LIGHT IN THE LORD. NOTICE HE
[1:38:36] DOESN'T SAY YOU WERE IN DARKNESS, BUT
[1:38:39] YOU were darkness.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; You were darkness. Hallelujah. But
[1:38:44] aren't you GLAD THERE'S A SEED LAYING
[1:38:46] DOWN INSIDE OF THAT DARKNESS? YOU DIDN'T
[1:38:48] REALIZE IT AT THE TIME. AND ALL THE LORD
[1:38:50] HAD TO DO WAS SPEAK JUST LIKE HE DID
[1:38:53] OVER THE EARTH. LET THERE BE LIGHT. AND
[1:38:55] THERE was light.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT NOW ARE YE LIGHT IN THE
[1:39:01] LORD. NOT IN THE LIGHT, BUT NOW ARE YE
[1:39:05] LIGHT in the Lord. Walk as children of
[1:39:08] light. EPHESIANS 5:11. HAVE NO
[1:39:10] FELLOWSHIP WITH THE UNFRUITFUL works of
[1:39:12] darkness, but rather reprove them.
[1:39:15] EPHESIANS 6:12, FOR WE WRESTLE NOT
[1:39:17] AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD, BUT AGAINST
[1:39:19] PRINCIPALITIES. SAME WORD WE TALKED A
[1:39:21] WHILE AGO. WE'RE WRESTLING AGAINST
[1:39:24] DEMONS. THEY'RE RIGHT HERE IN THIS
[1:39:26] BUILDING TONIGHT.
[1:39:28] DEMONS, DEMON POWERS TRYING TO ANOINT
[1:39:31] YOU, GET YOU TO PULL AWAY FROM THE WORD,
[1:39:34] TRY TO GET YOU TO DOUBT GOD'S PROMISE,
[1:39:36] TRY TO GET YOU TO BELIEVE THE BAD
[1:39:38] DOCTOR'S REPORT OVER THE PROMISE OF THE
[1:39:40] WORD OF GOD, AND YOU'RE WRESTLING WITHIN
[1:39:42] PRINCIPALITIES.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; OH MY PRINCIPALITIES, AGAINST POWERS,
[1:39:50] against the rulers
[1:39:53] of the darkness
[1:39:55] of THIS WORLD.
[1:39:57] AGAINST SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS IN HIGH or
[1:40:00] heavenly places. COLOSSIANS 1:13, WHO
[1:40:04] HATH DELIVERED US FROM THE POWER OF
[1:40:07] DARKNESS, and hath translated us into
[1:40:12] the kingdom of his dear son.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. 1 THESSALONIANS
[1:40:18] 5:4. BUT YE, BRETHREN, ARE NOT IN
[1:40:20] DARKNESS THAT THAT DAY SHOULD OVERTAKE
[1:40:23] YOU AS A THIEF. YE ARE ALL CHILDREN OF
[1:40:26] LIGHT
[1:40:28] AND CHILDREN OF THE DAY. WE ARE NOT OF
[1:40:32] THE NIGHT NOR of darkness. Can the
[1:40:35] church say amen to them?
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; FIRST PETER 2:9. BUT YE ARE A CHOSEN
[1:40:41] GENERATION, a royal priesthood, A HOLY
[1:40:45] NATION, A PECULIAR PEOPLE THAT YOU
[1:40:48] SHOULD SHOW FORTH.
[1:40:54] AH, you mean when we come to church,
[1:40:57] when we work,
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE DRIVE OUR CAR, when we live our
[1:41:00] life, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SHOW FORTH
[1:41:02] PRAISES. We're chosen to do that.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; A peculiar people that YOU SHOULD SHOW
[1:41:08] FORTH THE PRAISES OF HIM WHO HAS CALLED
[1:41:11] YOU OUT OF DARKNESS INTO his marvelous
[1:41:15] light.
[1:41:17] FIRST JOHN 2:8 AGAIN, A NEW COMMANDMENT
[1:41:19] I WRITE UNTO YOU. WHICH THING IS true in
[1:41:21] him and in you? I love that communion.
[1:41:24] THAT NEW COMMANDMENT is true in him AND
[1:41:27] IN YOU. BECAUSE THE DARKNESS IS PASSED,
[1:41:31] and the true light now shineth. HE THAT
[1:41:34] SAITH HE IS IN LIGHT AND HATETH HIS
[1:41:37] BROTHER is in darkness even until now.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; 1 JOHN 2:1. BUT HE THAT HATETH HIS
[1:41:45] BROTHER IS IN DARKNESS, AND WALKETH IN
[1:41:47] DARKNESS, AND KNOWETH NOT WHETHER HE
[1:41:50] GOETH, BECAUSE THAT DARKNESS had blinded
[1:41:52] his eyes. JUDE VERSE 4. FOR THERE ARE
[1:41:56] CERTAIN men
[1:41:58] who flew in.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; They crept.
[1:42:10] low,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; cunning,
[1:42:14] deceitful.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't notice me. I'm a nobody. I'm
[1:42:21] I'm nothing. I don't want anything at
[1:42:24] all. Just here for fellowship.
[1:42:29] For there are certain men crept in
[1:42:33] unawares, crept to enter secretly,
[1:42:38] slip in stealthily to steal in. And most
[1:42:44] of the time whenever they steal in,
[1:42:46] they'll steal out
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; and steal what they can on the way out.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Well, PRAISE THE LORD. BUT THERE ARE
[1:42:54] CERTAIN MEN CREPT IN OUT OF WARES. BUT
[1:42:57] NO, I love the way Jude says it. Now
[1:42:59] remember, Jude was the foster brother of
[1:43:01] the Lord Jesus.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; So he's raised in the same house
[1:43:04] naturally as Jesus was. But he never
[1:43:07] even mentions it. Strange. Boy, if it's
[1:43:09] a message preacher, he said, "I'm the
[1:43:11] brother of the Lord Jesus." Now, y'all
[1:43:12] need to hear me now. I'll tell you one
[1:43:13] thing. I fish with him. I hunted with
[1:43:15] him. I ate jelly with him. And I ate
[1:43:16] everything else. Y'all need to hear me
[1:43:17] because I'm the bishop. I reckon this
[1:43:19] it's all in the family. Ain't it? I
[1:43:20] mean, I'm a half brother of the Lord
[1:43:22] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Jew don't even mention it all. We
[1:43:25] wouldn't even know it if the other guys
[1:43:26] hadn't talked about it. That's the way a
[1:43:28] real true servant of God is. FOR THERE
[1:43:30] ARE CERTAIN MEN CREPT IN UNAWARES WHO
[1:43:32] WERE BEFORE OF OLD ORDAINED.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; The Lord just said, "Jude, write and
[1:43:39] pull the hide off of the devil. JUST LET
[1:43:41] THEM KNOW I'M THE ONE. I'm the one who
[1:43:46] ordained it."
[1:43:49] Woo! ungodly men turning the grace of
[1:43:54] our God into lasciviousness.
[1:43:57] SO APOSTATES ARE VERY CRAFTY and subtle,
[1:44:01] clever ministers. Ministers who he's
[1:44:03] talking about and they will deceive the
[1:44:06] naive believers
[1:44:09] and they will use deception to make it
[1:44:12] acceptable. You see, evil would be way
[1:44:16] too easily understood in Saul, even by
[1:44:19] the simple, IF THERE WAS NOT SUBTLE
[1:44:22] MEANS BY which deceptive words and
[1:44:25] deceptive mannerisms.
[1:44:28] That's exactly what Satan's doing to the
[1:44:30] world right now. He's just getting them
[1:44:32] all right in to get them ready for one
[1:44:34] man leadership.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; OH MY. AND WHAT DO THEY DO? TURNING THE
[1:44:42] GRACE OF God
[1:44:45] into lasciviousness.
[1:44:47] Turning the grace
[1:44:50] of God into lasciviousness.
[1:44:54] So they turn grace and they take it
[1:44:56] around and say, "Well, you know, you
[1:45:00] you're going to do these things and you
[1:45:02] can't help it and you can't keep from
[1:45:04] it." And you know, it's okay.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; It's okay. Hey, as I said, tell you,
[1:45:09] we've got Christian drug addicts and
[1:45:11] we've got Christian drunks and we got
[1:45:13] Christian homosexuals and Christian this
[1:45:16] and Christian that. And you got these
[1:45:18] preachers. It's okay. You know, it it's
[1:45:20] it's sad to say, but we've got some of
[1:45:22] the message that's heading in the same
[1:45:24] direction.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I know you don't know it, but
[1:45:26] believe me, they are heading in the same
[1:45:28] direction. Well, God understands, you
[1:45:30] know, why you can't you can't do it this
[1:45:32] way. And you know, there's a certain man
[1:45:34] that I to several several years ago.
[1:45:36] said, "Brother Donnie, you're not my
[1:45:37] pastor, but I I really just like to to
[1:45:39] ask you some questions, and I know
[1:45:41] you'll be honest with me. I've done this
[1:45:42] and this and this, and I've lived this
[1:45:44] way, and I've done that way, and I want
[1:45:46] you to tell me, do you think I've got
[1:45:47] the Holy Ghost?" I said, "Absolutely
[1:45:48] not."
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "I figured THAT'S WHAT YOU'D
[1:45:52] TELL ME." HE SAID, "BUT MY pastor has
[1:45:55] BEEN TELLING ME THAT I DO."
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Famous message preacher.
[1:46:02] So would somebody please stand to your
[1:46:03] feet and tell me what good the Holy
[1:46:05] Ghost is if it don't keep you from such
[1:46:06] nonsense and filth.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, pour it in Jesus.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; NOTICE, YOU KNOW, SATAN IS SO CUNNING.
[1:46:19] LORD CHILLING, CAN YOU IMAGINE US
[1:46:21] WALKING OUT OF THIS BUILDING TONIGHT AND
[1:46:23] MEETING SUCH AN ENEMY on our own?
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't walk out of this building. I
[1:46:30] just camp out right here.
[1:46:32] But you know what? If the Lord lets me
[1:46:35] live, I'm going to go through that door
[1:46:36] in a little bit. I'm going to put my
[1:46:37] coat on and I'm going to the house and I
[1:46:39] ain't going to go out and stick my head
[1:46:40] out the door and say, "Which way did he
[1:46:42] go? Which way did he go? Oh no. Oh no.
[1:46:46] The bad old devil. That mean old devil.
[1:46:48] Oh, he's going to do this, that, and
[1:46:50] other." No, that ain't the way I'm
[1:46:52] going. I'm watching. I say, "Look out,
[1:46:53] devil. Here I come. Here I come, devil.
[1:46:56] I DONE BEEN EQUIPPED BY THE WORD OF
[1:46:57] GOD." GOD DON'T JUST WANT THE PASTOR TO
[1:46:59] BE THAT WAY. GOD WANTS YOU LEOTY TO BE
[1:47:02] THAT WAY. I AIN'T TALKING ABOUT LOOKING
[1:47:04] FOR TROUBLE, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT IF
[1:47:06] TROUBLE SHOWS UP, MAKE TROUBLE REGRET
[1:47:08] THAT IT KNOCKED ON YOUR DOOR.
[1:47:11] IF TROUBLE COMES AND FEAR COMES AND
[1:47:14] DOUBT COME AND FRUSTRATION COME, MAKE
[1:47:17] [screaming] DOUBT GO DOWN TO HELL. OH,
[1:47:19] HALLELUJAH. CRYING, I MEAN, AND A
[1:47:21] WHIMPERING LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SAID,
[1:47:23] "BOY, I WISH I'D never went to her
[1:47:25] house.
[1:47:26] Amen.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; I love these next paragraphs here that
[1:47:36] we're going to read.
[1:47:38] And Christ the mystery.
[1:47:41] Love one another above everything.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Love one another. No matter what the
[1:47:45] devil tries to say. You're all one great
[1:47:47] big sweet group now.
[1:47:50] But remember
[1:47:52] my warning.
[1:47:55] Satan won't let that stay that way.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Has it happened?
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. HE'LL SHOOT EVERYTHING IF HE
[1:48:06] HAS TO BRING SOMEBODY in to make his
[1:48:09] target. He'll bring some critic or
[1:48:11] unbeliever in, set him down, cause him
[1:48:15] to fellowship with you under the
[1:48:18] quietness and things, and then he'll
[1:48:21] shoot.
[1:48:23] That guy was some kind of a poison
[1:48:25] stuff.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; And he'll start through the church with
[1:48:30] it.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Friends, we've had one after another
[1:48:35] after another after another around this
[1:48:38] precious message around the world. And
[1:48:41] you know who a lot of them have been?
[1:48:43] Preachers.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; And Satan studied him and said, "Yep,
[1:48:49] he's like me." So he pulls his hammer
[1:48:51] back
[1:48:54] And the preacher barely even felt it.
[1:48:58] Barely even felt it at all because it so
[1:49:01] harmonizes with his own ego.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; And the devil shot a dart of poison in
[1:49:06] him and the poison starts running
[1:49:10] through his body,
[1:49:12] his nature, his soul, his makeup.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Then Satan will put people around him
[1:49:18] and boy, they go to lifting him up. Boy,
[1:49:21] ain't nobody preaches what you preach.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Boy, I'll tell you one thing. You got
[1:49:25] bigger miracles than anybody. Man alive.
[1:49:28] Ain't nobody can sing like you sing.
[1:49:31] Ain't nobody can shake that leg like you
[1:49:33] shake yours. LORD HAVE MERCY. I AIN'T
[1:49:35] NEVER seen nobody shake that leg that
[1:49:36] way. Oh boy.
[1:49:39] And that poison goes to running through
[1:49:41] him. And yeah, he's getting bigger and
[1:49:44] bigger. And then somebody else will come
[1:49:46] up to him. Oh brother, I've been around
[1:49:47] for 85 years around this message. I
[1:49:50] ain't never heard nobody preach like
[1:49:52] you. You're just this and that and the
[1:49:54] other and his head's getting so big it
[1:49:56] won't go through the double doors in the
[1:49:57] front.
[1:49:59] Why? The poisons
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; kicked in.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; It ain't just preachers that does that.
[1:50:06] Singers can do it, too.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Musicians can do it.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; You're gonna get me fired one of these
[1:50:13] days, sir.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying.
[1:50:18] He'll shoot him. Lord have mercy.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; AND CAUSE HIM TO FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU
[1:50:26] UNDER THE quietness and things and then
[1:50:28] he'll shoot that guy
[1:50:32] with some kind of a poison stuff and
[1:50:34] he'll start to the church. Look, it's
[1:50:36] not just limited to a church. It can
[1:50:37] happen to a family.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; You watch one family member get OUT OF
[1:50:41] SYNC WITH GOD, IT CAN TEAR THAT WHOLE
[1:50:43] FAMILY ALL TO PIECES. ONE OF YOUR
[1:50:46] CHILDREN or a husband or a wife or a
[1:50:48] nephew or A NIECE OR WHATEVER IT IS,
[1:50:50] THEY GET ALL TORE UP AND OH MY THE WHOLE
[1:50:52] FAMILY JUST THEY THEY CAN'T GO TO CHURCH
[1:50:54] NO MORE. THEY'VE ALL GOT TO STAY HOME
[1:50:55] WITH THAT ONE AND THEY'VE OH LORD I
[1:50:57] DON'T WHAT WE'RE GOING TO OH LORD HAVE
[1:50:58] MERCY. OH LORD, DON'T YOU SEE WHAT IT
[1:51:00] IS.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; The devil got him in his sight
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; and he's got a silencer on his gun.
[1:51:10] So he just goes,
[1:51:13] "Oh,
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; that must have been a mosquito or in my
[1:51:16] case, a wasp."
[1:51:19] Smack. Oh, it's just a wasp.
[1:51:24] And then they start changing.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; The poison.
[1:51:30] And they go to hearing things.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Boy, you've got so many views on
[1:51:37] YouTube.
[1:51:39] I go over there and check brother so and
[1:51:40] so and see how many he's got.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; What I saw our church has got more than
[1:51:46] anybody
[1:51:51] in this day and age. I'm not so sure
[1:51:53] that's too much to brag about.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz the more you're known, the bigger
[1:51:58] your target is on your back.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:52:03] DON'T TAKE SIDES WITH IT. DON'T YOU HAVE
[1:52:06] NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING ELSE. You
[1:52:08] stay right, loving
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; and sweet
[1:52:14] and kind,
[1:52:18] which is the treatment against poison.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz you watch division and and and all
[1:52:25] these things that comes in a family or a
[1:52:27] church or a message community and it'll
[1:52:30] work the exact opposite of true love,
[1:52:33] forgiveness, fellowship, harmony. People
[1:52:36] that used TO BE THE BEST OF FRIENDS,
[1:52:39] once the poison starts circulating,
[1:52:42] they'll no longer even speak to one
[1:52:44] another.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Families will be divided
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; and separated.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Used to go to the same church, say amen
[1:52:53] to the same preacher, shout, "Take
[1:52:54] communion together." Now they don't even
[1:52:56] want to be seen together.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Donnie.
[1:53:03] NOW NOTICE HE SAYS STAY RIGHT LOVING AND
[1:53:06] SWEET and kind one another and pray for
[1:53:09] that man
[1:53:12] that he'll be saved too.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; So you mean a man that's been shot with
[1:53:20] poison
[1:53:22] needs prayer
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; that he'll be saved? Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying he's not a Christian now,
[1:53:28] man or woman, whichever it is, but they
[1:53:31] need salvation from that poison,
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; lest it kills them.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Children, don't you understand why some
[1:53:41] of these people that have left the
[1:53:42] message and they're taking on such
[1:53:44] anger, such hatred?
[1:53:48] THEY HATE THE MESSAGE PREACHERS. THEY
[1:53:50] HATE TO PROFIT. THEY HATE THE MESSAGE.
[1:53:53] THEY'VE changed so much.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; But here's why.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; They've been shocked.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; They hate.
[1:54:07] They despise.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Pray for them.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; AND NOTICE HE SAYS, "PRAY FOR THEM AND
[1:54:17] STICK TOGETHER. STAY WITH YOUR PASTOR.
[1:54:20] SEE, he's the shepherd. GIVE HIM
[1:54:22] RESPECTS. HE'LL LEAD YOU through cuz
[1:54:24] he's ordained of God to do so.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; But you know what becomes very
[1:54:28] difficult? When the pastor
[1:54:32] is the one that's been shot
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; and then the pastor gets bitter or
[1:54:41] proud. Just depends on the toxine that
[1:54:45] the devil mixed in the shot.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Anger won't work for every preacher.
[1:54:51] Pride won't work for every preacher. So,
[1:54:54] Satan mixes it up. Give them a little
[1:54:56] dose of this and a little bit of that
[1:54:58] and a little bit of that and a little
[1:55:00] bit of that and then
[1:55:03] oh
[1:55:05] must sweat me or something. Just tell me
[1:55:07] I'm too.
[1:55:09] And then the next service is different
[1:55:11] and the next one is different. Then he
[1:55:13] goes into THE VICTIM MENTALITY.
[1:55:14] EVERYBODY'S OUT TO GET ME. IT'S BECAUSE
[1:55:16] OUR CHURCH IS SO RIGHT. WE'RE THE ONLY
[1:55:18] ONES RIGHT. I'M PREACHING THE TRUTH. OH.
[1:55:21] I thought Paul said we don't preach
[1:55:23] ourselves.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; If you take men out of their own
[1:55:27] sermons, I'm not sure how much some of
[1:55:28] them would have to preach.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; I done this, I done that, or people's
[1:55:31] doing this against me or that against
[1:55:33] me. Why don't you tell me what Jesus has
[1:55:35] done?
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Won't you tell me how big my God is?
[1:55:37] Won't you TELL ME HOW BIG OUR GOD IS
[1:55:39] GOING TO HELP US TO OVERCOME? I I DON'T
[1:55:41] WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOU. I DON'T WANT TO
[1:55:43] HEAR ALL ABOUT YOUR TROUBLES AND YOUR
[1:55:44] TRIALS. SURE, TESTIFY ABOUT IT EVERY NOW
[1:55:46] AND THEN, BUT TELL ME HOW BIG GOD IS
[1:55:48] THROUGH YOUR TROUBLES. TELL ME HOW BIG
[1:55:50] GOD IS THROUGH YOUR TRIALS.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Now watch the next paragraph. The
[1:55:59] prophet says, "Now remember that
[1:56:02] question mark congregation says
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; amen."
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; It's amazing though how many message
[1:56:09] people will remember the quote. But when
[1:56:11] it comes to the practicality of just
[1:56:13] following the above two quotes, they do
[1:56:16] the exact opposite. Something will come
[1:56:18] in their family, something will come in
[1:56:19] the church, and they'll side right with
[1:56:21] it.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; So say it. It shows how easy sheep are
[1:56:27] to be deceived.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost. But you're still
[1:56:31] a sheep.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; I do you remember that congregation
[1:56:35] says, "AMEN. THE ENEMY WILL COME." And
[1:56:40] when he does,
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; you just cling that much closer
[1:56:45] together.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; And the one that the devil is using for
[1:56:50] an enemy will either get out
[1:56:54] or come in and be one of you.
[1:56:58] Now, you see the thing of it is none of
[1:57:01] us have a special pair of glasses or a
[1:57:04] magnifying glass to be able to look down
[1:57:06] in somebody's soul and say, "Serpent
[1:57:08] seed, seed of God, serpent seed, seed of
[1:57:10] God, seed of God, seed of God, serpent
[1:57:12] seed, serpent." They none of us can DO
[1:57:14] THAT.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; OH, SOME PEOPLE ALL THEY NEED is
[1:57:18] deliverance from the poison.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; AND THEY CAN BE YOUR BROTHER OR YOUR
[1:57:24] SISTER.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND NOW YOU'VE GOT TAPES ON THAT.
[1:57:29] YOU'VE GOT TAPES ON WHAT WE BELIEVE.
[1:57:32] YOU'VE GOT TAPES ON DISCIPLINE IN THE
[1:57:34] CHURCH.
[1:57:36] HOW WE BEHAVE OURSEL IN THE CHURCH OF
[1:57:38] GOD. HOW WE'VE GOT to
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Oh man.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Now that's done up on the screen. I
[1:57:52] guess I'm gonna have to read it.
[1:57:55] Oh,
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; wonder why we didn't cut that out and
[1:57:58] just kind of leave that out.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO COME TOGETHER
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; AND SIT TOGETHER IN HEAVENLY PLACES.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; How about y'all reading these next FEW
[1:58:13] WORDS WITH ME? DON'T STAY HOME.
[1:58:20] [applause]
[1:58:26] IF GOD IS IN YOUR HEART,
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS A lot of the problem.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; God ain't in some FOLKS HEART. IF GOD IS
[1:58:35] IN YOUR HEART, YOU CAN'T HARDLY WAIT FOR
[1:58:39] THEM DOORS. OH, GLORY. TO OPEN OUT
[1:58:43] YONDER AGAIN. AND YOU'RE TO FELLOWSHIP
[1:58:45] WITH YOUR BROTHERS. IF YOU DON'T FEEL
[1:58:47] THAT WAY, THEN I TELL YOU, IT'S time you
[1:58:51] got to praying.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; But you see what fallen angels have
[1:59:00] done?
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Fallen angels have crept into every
[1:59:06] message that God ever sent on the earth.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Before that truth could go on and
[1:59:14] proclamate. I won't read it to you. I'll
[1:59:16] quote it to you. Before that truth could
[1:59:18] go on and proclamate
[1:59:22] fallen angels got into it.
[1:59:26] What? He said fallen Lutheran,
[1:59:29] fallen Methodist,
[1:59:31] fallen Pentecostals.
[1:59:34] Let's complete the sequence, shall we?
[1:59:37] Fallen message people.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus.
[1:59:46] Let's jump down here to paragraph 86 and
[1:59:48] we'll close. If the brother you think is
[1:59:51] a little wrong or the sister say,
[1:59:52] "Lord,"
[1:59:55] don't never let the root of bitterness
[1:59:58] spring up
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; cuz it'll affect him. It'll take the
[2:00:03] Christ
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; right out
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; of my life.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Not drinking, friends. Not adultery.
[2:00:15] Bitterness. Bitterness against God.
[2:00:18] Bitterness against a preacher,
[2:00:20] bitterness against a brother or sister,
[2:00:21] family member, whatever. Bitterness will
[2:00:24] take the Christ
[2:00:27] right out of you. BUT BROTHER DONNIE,
[2:00:28] IT'S HARD. I KNOW IT'S HARD.
[2:00:32] I know it's hard.
[2:00:34] But it's it's attainable. Or God would
[2:00:37] not have anointed his prophet to say
[2:00:39] this.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; If it was impossible, no. Ain't no way.
[2:00:41] I understand. Ain't no way you'll get
[2:00:43] hurt so bad. There ain't no way you can
[2:00:44] get let bitterness will take every one
[2:00:45] of you. No, there's a way that we can
[2:00:49] live and be hurt and wounded by great
[2:00:52] people.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; And then the opportunity is there. And
[2:00:58] remember angels of light and angels of
[2:01:02] darkness
[2:01:03] and they will come and anoint your
[2:01:06] bitterness. Remember Paul identified it
[2:01:09] well. He didn't call it a leaf, a
[2:01:12] branch.
[2:01:14] He did not call it bark, but he called
[2:01:17] it a root
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; which is hid under the dirt.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; So it can be hid very deep. It grows and
[2:01:30] it grows.
[2:01:32] It's getting bigger and bigger. And the
[2:01:33] bigger it gets, the more of Christ, the
[2:01:36] anointed word life it squeezes out of
[2:01:40] your life.
[2:01:42] Oh Jesus,
[2:01:46] it'll take the Christ right out of my
[2:01:48] life. That poison
[2:01:51] acids of malice, jealousy, and hatred
[2:01:57] will take the Holy Spirit.
[2:02:00] right
[2:02:01] away from you.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of our message people
[2:02:07] are trying to live this message life and
[2:02:11] this kind of situation right here.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Bitterness, jealousy, envy, strife,
[2:02:16] malice, and they don't understand why
[2:02:19] they can't live it. Because they've
[2:02:21] grieved their power out of their lives.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; They've grieved their power. You won't
[2:02:28] overcome this just by quotes. YOU WON'T
[2:02:31] OVERCOME THIS BY ATTENDING CHURCH.
[2:02:34] Your personal power is your baptism in
[2:02:37] you. And if Satan can cause you to do
[2:02:39] this, you'll grieve away your own power.
[2:02:43] And there you stand there quoting the
[2:02:44] word, quoting the word, quoting the
[2:02:46] prophet, quoting the prophet.
[2:02:48] [panting]
[2:02:49] [gasps]
[2:02:53] But you're getting so weak quoting the
[2:02:55] word the whole time. And you're
[2:02:57] thinking, "WHY AIN'T IT WORKING? WHY
[2:02:58] AIN'T IT WORKING? WHY AIN'T IT WORKING?"
[2:03:01] Because she ain't got no power.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; It's just logos.
[2:03:06] And it's not Rama word.
[2:03:10] And this is why people say, "I guess it
[2:03:12] ain't for me.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; I guess I'll just leave. I tried it. I
[2:03:17] did my best." No. If you don't keep
[2:03:20] bitterness out, you ain't done your
[2:03:22] best.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Let's close.
[2:03:27] Notice this.
[2:03:29] I don't I don't I don't understand,
[2:03:30] friends. I honestly don't understand.
[2:03:32] Why don't our message preachers preach
[2:03:34] these things?
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; I know they're not deep. I know it's not
[2:03:38] convincing things. I I know people don't
[2:03:40] want this stuff. They want they want
[2:03:42] something that oh boy, everybody can
[2:03:43] leave. Oh my, just soaring in the
[2:03:45] heavens. I wonder sometimes if we had
[2:03:47] right down where we live if we couldn't
[2:03:48] soar higher after the meeting is over.
[2:03:53] the poison acids of malice and jealousy
[2:03:55] and hatred that'll take the Holy Spirit
[2:03:58] right away from you. It will run him
[2:04:00] from the tabernacle here.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Random is at his own church.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; And now the tabernacle is sitting empty.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can go for Wednesday night and
[2:04:17] have silent prayer.
[2:04:20] Wonder where the Holy Ghost is.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost, Brother Skip, that
[2:04:25] used to discern their hearts and raise
[2:04:27] the dead and cast out devils.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; So, is that what you want for our
[2:04:32] church?
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; IS THAT WHAT WE MESSAGE PEOPLE WANT FOR
[2:04:35] OUR CHURCHES?
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; That would just grieve the Holy Spirit
[2:04:40] away by these non deep things.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; It'll run him from the tabernacle. It'll
[2:04:46] kill the spirit of God or drive him from
[2:04:49] here. hurt your pastor, it'll do
[2:04:52] everything. Don't do that.
[2:04:57] Let's bow our heads together.
[2:05:03] My friends, we can't do this on our own.
[2:05:06] We can't do it by self-help books. We
[2:05:08] don't want to turn the message into
[2:05:11] self-help.
[2:05:13] And we come and educate oursel.
[2:05:16] We've got to have power to live this
[2:05:19] life. I don't want just power to cast
[2:05:21] out devils,
[2:05:23] power to lay hands on the sick and then
[2:05:25] recover. I want power to live this word.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Make the word manifest
[2:05:33] in our lives.
[2:05:35] I'll probably I I'll not be a great guy.
[2:05:37] I'll never have too old to start having
[2:05:39] that type of ambition
[2:05:42] myself.
[2:05:43] If I can just let the Lord live some of
[2:05:47] these simple things I what I preach to
[2:05:49] you tonight, I'll be a happy person to
[2:05:52] stand before God,
[2:05:54] to love, to pray for those who
[2:05:57] despitefully use me, for those who tell
[2:05:59] lies on you, and that doesn't need the
[2:06:01] same way, to be able to turn the other
[2:06:04] cheek,
[2:06:06] to be able to pray for those that would
[2:06:08] actually kill me if they could,
[2:06:12] and yet feel compassion. passion for him
[2:06:14] in your heart. How many wants to be like
[2:06:16] that? That's the Lord Jesus, friends.
[2:06:20] That's the Lord Jesus. As we've been
[2:06:22] preaching on Sunday about partakers of
[2:06:25] the divine nature, that's what he wants
[2:06:28] us to have.
[2:06:30] So, the spirit of God in us will
[2:06:33] recognize Satan's poison darts. Oh, he's
[2:06:37] aimed these darts at me. Yes, sir. He's
[2:06:40] aimed them at me. You better believe he
[2:06:41] has.
[2:06:43] But God's given me a shield,
[2:06:46] and by his grace, he's helped me through
[2:06:47] the years.
[2:06:50] If it was not for the grace of God,
[2:06:52] friends, where would we be tonight?
[2:06:55] Some of you have been lied to. You've
[2:06:57] been mistreated by preachers.
[2:07:00] You've been treated awful.
[2:07:04] And yet, by the help of the Lord, you've
[2:07:07] not let it turn you and make you bitter.
[2:07:10] And you ain't got nothing to brag about
[2:07:12] on that. God has helped you.
[2:07:16] God has helped you. What good does it do
[2:07:19] if we quote the seals and the thunders
[2:07:22] and the church ages? We look down our
[2:07:24] noses at all the denominations
[2:07:27] and we have so much bitterness in our
[2:07:29] hearts and our homes, our churches.
[2:07:33] Brother Don, you don't know what
[2:07:34] people's done to me. You're right. I
[2:07:36] don't. And let me just say that other
[2:07:39] way around to you. You don't know what
[2:07:41] people's done to me either. I've been
[2:07:44] treated worse by preachers, I dare say,
[2:07:46] than probably about everybody here.
[2:07:48] Maybe Brother Benton because he's lived
[2:07:50] longer than I have.
[2:07:53] So what do you want me to do? Stand up
[2:07:55] and tell you about each one of them? Why
[2:07:57] should I waste my time about such?
[2:08:01] Let's move on. Let's pray for them.
[2:08:05] Let's love
[2:08:07] Jesus said, "By this shall all men know
[2:08:12] that you are my disciples
[2:08:15] because you love one another."
[2:08:18] And he said, "I give you a new
[2:08:21] commandment
[2:08:23] that ye should love one another as I
[2:08:26] have loved you." Actually, if you know
[2:08:29] your Bible very well, you know
[2:08:30] Leviticus, the law of the Torah, told
[2:08:33] them to love one another.
[2:08:35] But it told them to love one another as
[2:08:38] they love theirel.
[2:08:41] But Jesus commandment was new in this
[2:08:43] way.
[2:08:45] He didn't tell us to love each other as
[2:08:48] we love oursel.
[2:08:50] But he told us to love others
[2:08:53] as he loved.
[2:08:56] And he loved us more than himself.
[2:09:02] You see, this is the new commandment
[2:09:04] that we actually love others
[2:09:07] more than ourselves. So, we have a right
[2:09:10] to be angry. They said this about us and
[2:09:12] they run us down. We have a right to get
[2:09:14] back at them and a right to do this and
[2:09:16] that and the other. But as sheep, we
[2:09:19] forfeit those rights.
[2:09:22] Then we're loving like Jesus.
[2:09:26] Oh my.
[2:09:29] Heavenly Father, as we
[2:09:33] come to a close of a of another service
[2:09:36] and to another year in a few hours
[2:09:42] by the Roman calendar.
[2:09:45] And we know, Lord, that people will be
[2:09:47] making New Year's resolutions. And for
[2:09:49] many of them, they didn't even keep last
[2:09:51] year's. And they'll just make another
[2:09:54] one, and it'll be empty. And some of
[2:09:56] them will go out and get drunk tonight
[2:09:58] and they'll do all kinds of things and
[2:10:02] send out fireworks and but Lord, I pray
[2:10:05] the fireworks would be inside of us
[2:10:08] tonight.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; May there be explosions of new life and
[2:10:14] new light and new understanding,
[2:10:18] Lord, that we would have a greater
[2:10:19] desire in 2026
[2:10:23] to be more like you.
[2:10:27] We long, Father, to be like you. As your
[2:10:31] prophet said, we long for those
[2:10:32] apostolic times moving among us. And he
[2:10:34] said, we see them, but we want more of
[2:10:37] them, but we don't just want to do signs
[2:10:40] and wonders.
[2:10:42] We want to love like you loved.
[2:10:45] We want to be able to forgive like you
[2:10:47] forgave.
[2:10:49] As a matter of fact, you forgave those
[2:10:50] Roman soldiers and they never even asked
[2:10:52] you to.
[2:10:54] You just said, "Father, forgive them for
[2:10:57] they know not what they do." I ain't
[2:10:59] talking about being soft pansies and
[2:11:02] cowards, but I'm talking about standing
[2:11:04] firm and solid. But when we've done
[2:11:07] that, we can take your behavior as our
[2:11:09] own. Lord, help us, Jesus.
[2:11:13] I need you too much, Lord, to be shot
[2:11:16] with Satan's poison
[2:11:19] and let it grow into bitterness or anger
[2:11:21] or strife or wrath or emulation.
[2:11:26] I need power in my life. Lord,
[2:11:30] I would be terrified to walk out these
[2:11:33] doors tonight
[2:11:35] just with my Bible under my arm and the
[2:11:38] quotes that I've committed to my memory.
[2:11:40] But it won't be but just a few more
[2:11:42] settings of the sun till my memory will
[2:11:45] start to leave me. And if I'm only
[2:11:48] serving and overcoming by memory, what
[2:11:50] will happen when I get older and I can't
[2:11:52] remember?
[2:11:54] But that power will never leave me even
[2:11:56] if my memory does.
[2:11:59] Lord Jesus, we need you tonight, Father.
[2:12:04] We worship you, Lord.
[2:12:07] We worship you, Lord Jesus.
[2:12:10] Can we just stand our feet?
[2:12:24] [snorts]
[2:12:27] How many by the grace of God to enter
[2:12:29] into this new year
[2:12:31] to be more like Jesus?
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; To forgive and love.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's any bitterness in you
[2:12:38] tonight, any jealousy, strife, whatever,
[2:12:42] let the Lord help you. You say, "But I
[2:12:44] can't do it. It's greater than me."
[2:12:46] Well, there's angels right here tonight
[2:12:49] in this building.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; We'll get to it. I'll show you where
[2:12:52] brother said that they was there to
[2:12:54] help. There was healing angels that was
[2:12:55] sent to bring people healing. Angels
[2:12:58] there to encourage angels to help do
[2:13:01] things that was beyond our human
[2:13:02] capability.
[2:13:04] So if it's greater than you tonight,
[2:13:06] there's angels of mercy.
[2:13:09] There's angels of God that can come. If
[2:13:11] demons can bring hate, don't you think
[2:13:13] the angels of God can help come and
[2:13:15] reverse that
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; and help us that we can leave this
[2:13:19] place, not with a New Year's resolution
[2:13:21] that we cannot keep,
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; but with just a sincere desire before
[2:13:26] God. Lord, I want to be more like you.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for my carnality. Forgive me
[2:13:31] for my failures in 2025. How many's had
[2:13:34] them?
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; How many Megan, you reckon? All kinds of
[2:13:38] them, right? So, you figure in 26 we
[2:13:40] ain't going to have no more mistakes.
[2:13:42] Not unless the rapture takes place
[2:13:43] before 12:00. There ain't no way we're
[2:13:45] going to we're going to have them.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; But the thing's going to be how we're
[2:13:48] going to deal with him. We're going to
[2:13:50] make them right before the Lord
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; and ask God to help us and strengthen
[2:13:53] us.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Would you mind praying for each other?
[2:13:59] I shared a quote today that that I found
[2:14:02] where brother pro brother Brandham would
[2:14:04] said I wish you a blessful and happy and
[2:14:09] blessed new year and may God you know
[2:14:11] you be able to grow and all those things
[2:14:14] that that's what we want to wish tonight
[2:14:17] that God will help us to be better
[2:14:19] people more consecrated
[2:14:22] I pray you'd forgive me for my mistakes
[2:14:25] and my failures
[2:14:28] as your pastor, if I've done anything to
[2:14:30] you or said anything to you, I ain't
[2:14:32] apologizing for the word now. I ain't
[2:14:34] going to apologize for that. But if I've
[2:14:37] done something to you, I pray you find
[2:14:39] it in your heart to forgive me. I pray
[2:14:42] if there's a brother or sister here that
[2:14:44] has offended you or hurt you, that
[2:14:46] you'll find it in your heart to forgive
[2:14:48] them. Maybe there's someone in another
[2:14:49] state, another preacher, another church,
[2:14:52] or something another, and they treated
[2:14:53] you bad. I pray you can find it in your
[2:14:56] heart to be able to forgive them. For
[2:14:59] I'm reminded of the words of the Lord
[2:15:00] Jesus. For if you forgive not men or
[2:15:02] their trespasses, neither will your
[2:15:03] heavenly father forgive yours.
[2:15:07] And then the prophet when he reads that
[2:15:09] and he preaches perfect faith and he
[2:15:10] says, so we find then faith is based on
[2:15:14] forgiveness.
[2:15:18] Brother Joe, would you come and pray?
[2:15:20] Pray for saints.
[2:15:26] I'll go down and pray for you.
[2:15:35] Heavenly Father,
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; we know you to be so many things and
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; the wealth of attributes which
[2:15:51] exist in who you are.
[2:15:57] During the times that we come and are
[2:15:58] faced with these circumstances of life
[2:16:02] that we think are impossible and
[2:16:06] uncsurmountable.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; we call on you tonight, oh God, to
[2:16:12] release those attributes unto us,
[2:16:14] Father.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; For Lord, our words are frail.
[2:16:19] Our abilities are limited.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; But oh God, we're seeking you to help us
[2:16:26] during these times, oh God.
[2:16:30] And
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, as I was sitting here at the
[2:16:31] beginning of service, I couldn't help
[2:16:33] but think of Mary.
[2:16:36] Lord, just a young girl
[2:16:38] who received a visitation
[2:16:42] by an angel who were saying things to
[2:16:46] her that she couldn't quite understand.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; But oh God,
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; that little girl in her youth,
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; in her simple understanding,
[2:16:59] she simply gave the word you her body.
[2:17:05] And oh God,
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; because of that surrender, because of
[2:17:09] that ability to say yes, Father, it
[2:17:13] changed the entire world.
[2:17:16] So Lord, that helps me to know that when
[2:17:18] we as believers, we as this little
[2:17:22] bride, this little girl bride, as I can
[2:17:25] say it that way, Lord, if we would
[2:17:27] simply submit and give to you our
[2:17:30] bodies, what you could do in our world,
[2:17:34] oh God, you can take and change
[2:17:37] situations and circumstances. And maybe
[2:17:40] there would be someone here tonight or
[2:17:42] by way of of streaming and we get the
[2:17:44] the message later. Father, they they not
[2:17:47] going to be able to uh go any further in
[2:17:50] the situation that's before them. And
[2:17:52] rightfully so in in looking at it with a
[2:17:55] human perspective, Lord. Truly, there is
[2:17:58] nothing more that they could do. So
[2:18:00] Lord, all that we can do, Father, all
[2:18:02] that they can do is simply say yes. Be
[2:18:05] it unto me, Lord, according to that word
[2:18:08] that we've heard tonight from the voice
[2:18:10] of your servant. So, Father, may we set
[2:18:14] aside everything that we thought that we
[2:18:16] had could do. May we set aside
[2:18:18] everything that we think that we are
[2:18:20] able to do and simply, Lord, lay
[2:18:22] ourselves prostate before you, Father
[2:18:25] God. Lord, saying that there's nothing
[2:18:28] in ourselves that we bring, but we
[2:18:30] simply cling to your cross. Oh God,
[2:18:33] forgive us, Father, of our failures.
[2:18:35] Forgive us of our weakness and why we're
[2:18:38] here in time. As our pastors already
[2:18:40] said, Lord, we're going to fail. We're
[2:18:42] going to make mistakes. But a just man,
[2:18:44] when he falls, a just woman when she
[2:18:47] falls, when she stumbles, when he
[2:18:48] stumbles, he picks himself up. She picks
[2:18:51] herself up, dust himself off, and they
[2:18:54] just go in the strength that only you
[2:18:56] can give, Father. So come and fill this
[2:18:59] room tonight, oh father, by your with
[2:19:02] your presence to do the impossible to
[2:19:05] speak, oh God, things that only you can
[2:19:08] speak. Oh God, forgive us, oh Lord. Come
[2:19:12] and receive us in that spirit. Lord, in
[2:19:15] that humility, Lord, we come humbly. We
[2:19:18] come quietly. We come reverently.
[2:19:20] Father, we come asking boldly just as
[2:19:24] Esther did that day. Lord, if you would
[2:19:27] say no, we're still going to come, oh
[2:19:30] God, because that's what you've told us
[2:19:31] to do over and over and over again.
[2:19:34] Lord, we're knocking. Lord, we're we're
[2:19:36] we're begging. Lord, we're looking unto
[2:19:38] you, the author and the finisher of our
[2:19:41] faith, the completer of everything that
[2:19:43] you have said that we would be. Father,
[2:19:46] grant it, Lord, through the very
[2:19:48] confession of our lips. Father, be it
[2:19:50] unto us according to your word. We love
[2:19:53] you. We thank you. We honor you. We
[2:19:56] adore you, Father.
[2:19:58] With our lips, we praise you, Father.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; When in the presence and company of
[2:20:02] angels here in this sanctuary, in this
[2:20:05] room, Father, we say this night, Lord,
[2:20:09] as we enter into a new year,
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're asking that you would be the
[2:20:14] provider of everything that we have need
[2:20:16] of. We're asking that you would be the
[2:20:19] instructor of every avenue down which we
[2:20:22] would walk. We ask that you would be the
[2:20:24] the giver of of every question that we
[2:20:27] may have, Lord, in this coming year. If
[2:20:30] sickness is standing in our way, we've
[2:20:32] gotten a report from the doctor that we
[2:20:34] don't know what to do, Lord. We look
[2:20:36] unto you. You are the author. You are
[2:20:39] the finisher of all things. We need you,
[2:20:41] Lord.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; We're standing in the need of prayer.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; It's not my mother. It's not my father.
[2:20:48] It's not my sister. It's not my brother.
[2:20:50] But, Lord, it's me. once again letting
[2:20:53] you know that we have needs. Oh God,
[2:20:56] we're in need of you. May you just come,
[2:20:59] Father God, in the sweetness in your
[2:21:02] presence, Father, fill this place.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; May you just come and fill every fiber
[2:21:07] of our being. We submit it to you once
[2:21:09] again, oh God. Oh, lamb of God, we just
[2:21:12] love you and we thank you for what
[2:21:14] you're going to do. Granted, Lord, as
[2:21:16] the prophet has told us, Lord, we don't
[2:21:18] want to turn over a new leaf in the new
[2:21:20] year because the winds of time, the
[2:21:22] winds of life may come and blow that
[2:21:24] leaf over, but Lord, we're coming unto
[2:21:27] you,
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Lord. There may be a season
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; in only the way that we know how. We
[2:21:30] thank you for the word tonight. And may
[2:21:32] it accomplish that that it set forth to
[2:21:34] do.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; May we take
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need you, Lord.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Father, set our hearts on fire. I pray,
[2:21:42] Lord God. I need [singing]
[2:21:45] you. Oh,
[2:21:49] I
[2:21:51] need thee
[2:21:54] to church to be set on fire. Every
[2:22:01] hour
[2:22:04] I need thee.
[2:22:07] [singing]
[2:22:10] Oh, bless
[2:22:14] me now.
[2:22:17] My savior.
[2:22:20] [singing]
[2:22:25] I
[2:22:26] come
[2:22:29] [singing]
[2:22:30] to
[2:22:34] thee.
[2:22:37] I need
[2:22:42] thee. Oh,
[2:22:46] I need [singing] thee.
[2:22:49] Amen.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Every
[2:22:55] every hour [screaming]
[2:22:58] I need thee.
[2:23:01] [singing]
[2:23:03] Oh,
[2:23:04] bless
[2:23:07] me now.
[2:23:09] My savior. [singing]
[2:23:16] I
[2:23:18] come
[2:23:22] to
[2:23:26] thee.
[2:23:29] One more time. I need
[2:23:34] thee.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Oh
[2:23:39] my,
[2:23:47] [singing]
[2:23:49] every every hour [screaming]
[2:23:52] I [singing] need thee.
[2:23:57] Oh
[2:23:58] bless
[2:24:00] bless me now
[2:24:03] my
[2:24:05] savior [music and singing]
[2:24:11] I
[2:24:13] come [singing]
[2:24:16] to
[2:24:21] to thee.
[2:24:24] Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the
[2:24:27] Lord, Jesus. Praise the Lord. [music]
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. We worship you, Lord.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. In need strength for the new year,
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; courage,
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; faith, help.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed. Don't be ashamed to
[2:24:48] let your needs and your requests be
[2:24:50] known.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Lord God, I need you more than ever.
[2:24:55] I need your wisdom to guide your people.
[2:24:57] I can't do it, Lord. Sometimes the
[2:24:59] burdens gets so heavy, Father. I think I
[2:25:02] can't do it no more. I think I can't
[2:25:04] have another interview. I think I can't
[2:25:05] call somebody in another country. I
[2:25:07] think I can't answer another email. I
[2:25:09] can't answer another text, another
[2:25:11] WhatsApp.
[2:25:13] Dear God, I get bombarded
[2:25:16] day in and day out.
[2:25:19] But yet, Lord Jesus, I can stand here
[2:25:21] tonight and testify. Not one time have
[2:25:24] you ever failed me.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; You sure can't say the same thing about
[2:25:28] me. I'm so glad, oh Lord,
[2:25:33] I can say about you. You are faithful.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; You are faithful and you have been all
[2:25:41] of my life.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; I thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:25:50] How many loves him tonight with all your
[2:25:52] heart? Can we just raise our hands? Oh,
[2:25:55] thank God for the goodness of God.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; For the goodness of God. Surely goodness
[2:26:01] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[2:26:04] of my life. And I will dwell in the
[2:26:07] house of the Lord forever. Hallelujah.
[2:26:12] We worship you tonight, Father. Let's
[2:26:14] just worship him just a little bit
[2:26:15] before we go. Amen. Praise God.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. [singing and music]
[2:26:21] Let's sing it together now. Praise God
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; for your mercy. Mercy never fails me.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; And all [music and singing] my all my
[2:26:32] days
[2:26:34] I've been held in your hands.
[2:26:38] [music]
[2:26:39] From the moment that I wake that I wake
[2:26:42] up [music]
[2:26:44] until I [singing]
[2:26:45] lay my head,
[2:26:49] I have seen [music]
[2:26:51] of the [singing] goodness
[2:26:54] of God
[2:26:56] [music] with all of our hearts now.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; All my life you have been
[2:27:03] [music and singing] faithful.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say amen to that? All
[2:27:10] my [music] life, you [singing] have been
[2:27:12] so so good. [music]
[2:27:18] Every breath that I [singing] am,
[2:27:22] I'm aable. Oh, I [music] will [singing]
[2:27:25] sing
[2:27:27] of the goodness
[2:27:30] of God.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Let's [music] testify at the end of
[2:27:32] 2025.
[2:27:35] He's been so good to me.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; He's been so good.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; You have led me [music] through the
[2:27:40] fire.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Thank [singing] you, Jesus. Through the
[2:27:43] hard times, through the tough times,
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; you were [music and singing] close like
[2:27:50] no other.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Listen to these [music] words now.
[2:27:54] [singing]
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; You as a father.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Known you as my father.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; I've known you yet. I've known you as
[2:28:00] [music] my closest friend. And I have I

[2:30:40] My Lord,
[2:30:42] all my life you have [music] been so
[2:30:47] so so
[2:30:49] very good. So [music] very good. With
[2:30:51] every [singing] breath
[2:30:54] that I made, [music]
[2:30:58] I will see
[2:31:00] of the goodness [singing]
[2:31:03] of God.
[2:31:06] Oh.
[2:31:09] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:31:11] Lord Jesus, thank you tonight. Father,
[2:31:14] we're so grateful for your mercy to us.
[2:31:17] Father, may we take these things and
[2:31:19] ponder over them and think about them.
[2:31:20] Lord,
[2:31:22] we need your help, Father, to be able to
[2:31:25] manifest this word. We know the type of
[2:31:28] woman you take from this world in a
[2:31:31] rapture will speak of your own
[2:31:34] character.
[2:31:36] So if you take one person that's a liar,
[2:31:40] one person that's a trickster,
[2:31:43] one person that's a deceiver, a thief,
[2:31:47] that shows the type of God you are.
[2:31:52] Oh, sure. Islam can serve that kind of
[2:31:55] God because in their own book, it says
[2:31:58] that Allah himself lies
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; and Allah himself tells them it's okay
[2:32:03] to lie.
[2:32:05] Well, that shows their God is not the
[2:32:08] God of truth.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; But you'll not take one liar, one thief,
[2:32:16] only the elect of God, those that are
[2:32:18] sanctified in your presence. That's the
[2:32:21] type of people we want to be. We hope
[2:32:24] and pray 2026
[2:32:26] will be the year of the rapture. But if
[2:32:29] not,
[2:32:30] we'll still be faithful in 27 and 28 and
[2:32:34] 29 and on and on until it comes.
[2:32:40] We love you, Lord Jesus. Go with us now,
[2:32:43] Father. Be with us. Bring us back again
[2:32:46] Sunday if it be pleasing to you, Lord.
[2:32:49] We commit our lives to you now, Father.
[2:32:51] In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:32:54] And the saints said,
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; Everybody will be happy over there.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this together as we go. Can
[2:33:03] you say, "It's been good to be in the
[2:33:04] house of the Lord."
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:33:08] Well, there's a happy land of promise
[2:33:11] over in the great [music] beyond
[2:33:14] [singing] where the saved lovers shall
[2:33:16] soon glory share
[2:33:20] where the souls [music] of men shall
[2:33:22] enter and live on forever more.
[2:33:26] Everybody [music]
[2:33:28] will be happy. Oh,
[2:33:32] I said everybody [music]
[2:33:36] will be happy. Will be [music]
[2:33:41] happy.
[2:33:45] Oh, we [music] will shout and sing God's
[2:33:49] praise. Everybody [music] will be happy
[2:33:53] over there. [singing]
[2:33:56] Well, there will [music] no man praying
[2:33:59] and no mourning in that lamb for no
[2:34:03] burdens there will be for [music] us to
[2:34:06] bear.
[2:34:08] All the people will be singing glory,
[2:34:12] glory [music] to the lamb. Won't that be
[2:34:14] awesome? Everybody will be happy over
[2:34:18] there. [music]
[2:34:19] Well, everybody
[2:34:23] [singing]
[2:34:24] will be [music] happy.
[2:34:27] Will be happy.
