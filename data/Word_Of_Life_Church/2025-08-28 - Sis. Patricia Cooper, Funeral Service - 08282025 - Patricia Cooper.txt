And I know your presence here brings them comfort. And and brother Don, we offer our condolences to you and the family and the friends who mourn for sister Patty's passing. But you know, we weep not as those who have no hope. And though our hearts are sad at the passing of our sister, there is a joy in knowing that she has made it home. Let's bow our heads. Father, we come before you this evening with thanksgiving in our hearts. For the revelation that's given us in your word, for it's written, precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. It is also written unto our God belongs the issues of death. For we know that Christians don't die. They just change dwelling places. And may we find comfort in your word. We pray and we ask your blessings upon this service tonight. May all be done for your glory. We ask for your comfort that you comfort the hearts of the family and the friends and that you'd be with our precious brother Don and help him in the days ahead. Fill the emptiness that's left in his heart with your presence and your mercy and your grace. Thank you for the life our sister Patty lived, Lord. For she lived that life by the word and a life lived by the word as the word expressed. And we saw Christ in our sister's life. So Lord, we commit these things, this service, and all that's done. May it be done for your glory. For we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Patricia Jean Garrettson Cooper, 76, Johnson City, passed away Friday, August the 22nd, 2025 at her residence, surrounded by her loving family. She was born September the 1st, 1948 in Emma Mariah, West Virginia to the late Denver and Pauline Cunningham Garrettson. Patty was a former payroll administrator for Ideal Corrugated Box Company from 1967 to 1973. On August the 25th, 1973, she married Brother Don Cooper and was then a full-time wife and a homemaker. She loved to garden and had some beautiful flowers. Patty has been a faithful Christian her whole life and loved attending here at Word of Life Church. Survivors include her loving husband of almost 52 years, Donald E. Cooper. Brothers and sister-in-laws Charles and Eveina Cooper of Holland, Michigan, Junior and Brenda Cooper of Olive, Kentucky, Forest and Phyllis Wren of Mansfield, Ohio, and Anne Cooper of Olive, Kentucky, and several nieces, nephews, and cousins and brothers and sisters here in the church who will sadly miss her. As I was looking over Sister Patty's obituary, I noticed it never said she ran for governor of West Virginia or mayor of Elizabeth. And it never said she was a successful songwriter or an actor. Never said that Hollywood was mourning her loss. It never said none of that. But what it did say was that she was a love a loving wife to brother Don, a homemaker who loved gardens and flowers. A devout Christian who served God her whole life. And that's my memories of her was in church sitting beside brother Don worshiping God and receiving his word and seeing that Christlike nature that was reflected in her life. Those are my memories of her. And though the governor of Tennessee may not know her name, I believe the God who created heavens and earth does. &gt;&gt; For he wrote her name in his book before the foundation of the world. And just a few days ago, when Sister Patty left this dimension, there was a great cloud of witnesses rejoicing as she stepped upon the shore. For Sister Patty made it home. And though Hollywood didn't know her, this group did. And with loving arms, they welcomed Sister Patty home. Goresis, till we meet you again. May God bless each of you. Be my prayer in Jesus name. [Music] Suddenly the pain is gone that I suffered for so long. Now I stand at an open door. [Music] As I take one step in time, I begin to realize what my soul's been longing for. [Music] Mortal words cannot describe what appears before my eyes. [Music] And I'm just inside the gate. [Applause] Just inside the gate where love. God's light shining from the throne fills heaven with a soul. Can't believe the change in me. I've never felt so free. [Music] And I'm just inside the gate. Now at last my mind is clear. Worldly thoughts have disappeared. Now every thought is just of him. No more worries, doubt, or fears. These new eyes can't shed a tear. It's peace and joy now that dwells within. Never felt so young and strong. This place, it is my home. And I'm just inside the gate. Just inside the gate where love ones. God's light shining from the throne fills heaven with the soul. I can't believe the change in me. I've never felt so free. And I'm just inside again. [Music] More than I have ever dreamed. You have heard or I have seen and I'm just inside just inside the gate where love. God's light shining from the throne fills heaven with the soul. I can't believe the change in me. I've never felt so free. Oh, and I'm just inside the game. And I'm just inside the game. [Music] to the family. God bless you. They say that one of the most sweetest sounds to the ear is when you hear your name called. A few weeks ago, I had a distinct pleasure of having breakfast with brother Don, sister Patty, and it was unplanned, unrehearsed. I was having some work done on my truck. It's backsliding. When you all think of it, pray for it. And usually if where I where I take it, uh there's a little restaurant I usually go to in the morning, eat breakfast or whatever. I took my backpack and was going to study and things of that sort, but it was closed. And so I um knew that the little Hardies was just right down the road and I didn't mind walking. Exercise did me some good, but I thought about when I'm going have to walk back and so I took the journey. Many times footsteps of the Lord or footsteps of the righteous order of the Lord. And many times when we have things that happen, we don't understand fully. And even after we have the encounter, we still don't understand fully. But when I stepped into the restaurant, I saw Brother Don, Sister Patty at the counter. And I uh snuck up behind them. And and I'll never forget this, Brother Don. And it still rings in my ear talking about hearing your your name called. I made my way up behind them to their left and Sister Patty looked up to my left. Joel. Just like that. And we sat down and you know we we we had our breakfast and I watched her as she uh never seen this before. I watched her as she had her biscuit and gravy and she brother Don helped her open up her pack of jelly. She put jelly in her biscuits and gravy. That's country stuff there. Simple stuff. But spending that time with them, learned a little about their love story and just the the joy that they had in life. But hearing the name called and just on Friday, just a few hours before she passed, I was there at the house. Brother Don, I just thank you for the call letting me know and I just wanted to come and just be what I could be during that time and just learned a little more about their story. And I was just wondering when brother Don asked me to say a few words this evening, what was I going to say? and just began to pray about it and just the inspiration came and I just want to share this with you, brother Don. And it it expresses some things that that you told me and things that you all shared. When it's time to say goodbye in memory of Patty. When it's time to say goodbye, but the words just won't form and the tongue tangles even with the thought because this time by isn't good. We exchanged this expression often as we journeyed together, but it was always with the thought and knowing it was only for a short time until we would unite again. Goodbye. I love you. I'll be back soon. But this time, this time it's different. The last words I heard you say bore my name as you called me from across the room. Hey, Don. The second it took me to be at your side was all that was needed for your words from then on to become faint, iniccernable, undicernable mumblings. I couldn't make out what you were saying after you said Don. And then your words were gone. Our conversation was over. I'll treasure that word, Don. Not because it's my name, but because you said it. God allowed the last thing I heard you to say here in time space to be my name. I will treasure that. I will carry it for the rest of my time here in time. It will be just as valuable and precious and real with substance and full of life as you were to me. As was my ritual upon waking, I reached across the bed to take your hand. But you weren't there. You were gone. Goodbye. Only this time, it's different. Just as it is when something needs to be said because saying that one thing, that one simple thing will somehow change things forever. I can't seem to get the words to loose from my tongue. So now it's time to say goodbye. Now that it's time to say goodbye, I am met with a new reality. A promise of stepping back into eternity together, hand in hand, you and me again. eternal and then then we can finish the conversation we began here. Hey, Don. Yeah, honey. God bless you. [Music] I can just see them walking on the shores of heaven, praising the Lord, watching the tides roll [Music] friends that have gone on. Oh, how I miss you so. [Music] Somehow I know if you could you let me know you're doing fine. It doesn't hurt anymore. [Music] Things couldn't be better. Heaven is worth waiting for. And you miss me, too. Until then, you'll be thinking of me. [Music] And I know if you could talk to me now, here's what you'd say to me. Wish you were here. It's such a beautiful place. Wish you were here. Nothing but clear sunny days. [Music] It never rains and no one complains. We haven't seen a tear. Oh, having a great time. Wish you were here. I can just see them walking on the shores together. [Music] They're talking of Jesus, safe and secure in his love. friends and loved ones walking in heavenly peace. And I know if they could talk to me now, here's what they'd say to me. Wish you were here. It's such a beautiful place. [Applause] Wish you were here. Nothing but clear sunny days. It never rains and no one complains. We haven't seen a tear. Oh, we're having a great time. [Music] Wish you were here. [Music] It never rains and no one complains. We haven't seen a tear. Oh, we're having a great time [Music] and we wish you were here. [Music] certainly wish to extend our condolences to family and friends of our departed sister. I'd like to read to you tonight from Job chapter 42. Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that I understood not, things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. Here I beseech thee, and I will speak. I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee. I'd like to speak to you for just a just for a few minutes about I've heard but now I see sister Patty certainly meant a lot to us yours church family and each of you that are your family members and friends and no doubt each of you would have something that you could say specifically about her that maybe no one else could today. We were certainly blessed to have her and brother Dawn here with us for all the years that they were here. And she's experienced things already just in the last few days that most of us have only heard about. When she was younger, she heard that she was a sinner and she heard that God provided a savior. Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word. She heard about it and then something supernatural happened in her soul. And then she could say, "I have heard, but now I see." So maybe she had knew about Christians and heard about Christians, but she wasn't one until the work of Christianity happened in her own heart. You see, life itself is like that. There's lots of things that we hear about, and many of them we will never see. But as we go on in life, we realize the things that have the most value are those things which are of eternal value. No doubt Sister Patty had heard about the Holy Ghost. Might have seemed very strange to her for a while as it was in the book of Acts when Paul came to the upper coast of Ephesus and said, "How were you all baptized?" And began to inquire about their salvation and so on. And they said, "Have you received the Holy Ghost?" And they said, "We've not even heard that there was any Holy Ghost." So they said, "Well, how was you baptized?" So they begin to tell them, and it was the first they'd heard about it. So as he began to tell them about that, they had their own supernatural experience and they could say, "I have heard, but now &gt;&gt; I see." You see, Sister Patty had heard for years one of the most beloved psalms that there is, of course, in the cannon of scripture, and it was this one. Psalm 23:3. He restoreth my soul. He leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Now, for every one of us here tonight, we realize if we're not alive when the Lord comes that we will go by the way of the grave. And there's an uncertainty about death. We can fear water. We can fear heights. We can fear cancer. We can fear all types of things. But ultimately, the greatest fear that man has is death itself. Is it really cancer that we fear so bad? Or is it we're afraid we will die or tuberculosis or whatever disease that it might be being up high. Some people terrified by heights. Why? The ultimate fear deaths. So when David began to write this, the Old Testament perspective was death was so different than what we have today. But still he had an understanding that death had this darkness. But he used these powerful words that yay though I walked through the valley of the shadow of deaths. And even with the Old Testament perspective, he knew that there had to be so much light in order to make a shadow. Maybe sister Patty heard this scripture for many, many years, read about it, may even had it underlined and marked in her Bible. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. But if she could answer us back tonight, she could say, "I saw that in Psalms. I heard that preached about, but now I see what that means." That it's not terrifying at all. That it's not even frightening. It's just like a journey that you're making and it's so rapid and so fast. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. So our sister could say to us, I have heard, but now I see for this was fulfilled in me. St. John 14:1, the Lord Jesus, he is going to give us a perspective of death that man had never had before. And he said this, "Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. For in my father's house are many mansions. Now he's not talking about buildings made out of cinder block and two befores, but if you look at your Greek word there, it's way beyond just natural houses. But it's a body to live in. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am, there you may be also. No doubt as a Christian, she read that in her Bible and maybe just sat there and cry and think, "Wow, I wonder what that's going to be like." And she heard about it for years. But tonight she could say, "I have heard, but now I see." &gt;&gt; Now I see. What is this body here? You walked around by, you paid your respects, you looked at that body. If you touched it, it was cold, lifeless. You see, death is the settler of scores. What is man? Soul and dust. Life and yet at the same time working in our mortal body. Death is also working as well. And what does death do? Deaths settles the score. Whether you're rich or barely make your bills from one paycheck to another. Death has a way of putting every human being on the exact same plane. Heaven has no ritzy neighborhoods where the upper class Christians live and then ghettos on the other side of the poor Christians. And you see death itself levels all of that before us. I preached many, many funerals. I have never seen one casket full of gold. I've never seen one with Cadillac keys, Rolls-Royce keys, BMW keys. I've never seen titles, deeds. I've never seen $100 bills stacked up in there. You know why? The person there can't take a one of those things. &gt;&gt; So, when we come to this earth, we come naked. Pretty good type really. We have nothing. But when we leave, now you see we're talking about a different story. We come naked. We couldn't walk. We couldn't talk for days. We couldn't see. We had no reasoning hardly any understanding. We knew our mother's voice because we heard it as she was carrying us in the womb. Everybody else we had to learn. But now we've been through this school called the school of life. And when we leave this school of life, we will not leave naked. We will take things with us, but it's not the things that we put the majority of our time on. I'm afraid it will be our character, our reputation, our honor. You see those who die pulpers and brother Louie has shared it with me before working there at the funeral home that there's many people that when they die and they get their bodies and they have to take care of them. And he's told me before time and time again there will be no one not one person even show up to look at that person's body. Brother Lou asked me not long ago, but don't you think it'd be all right if I just stood up and sometime just read a little scripture and just tried to say a little something. Now, you think how sad that is that there's no one to cry one tear. There's no one there to say we'll miss you so much as a lot of it that person's fault could be and it could be circumstances beyond their control. So you see when we leave this life we want to be able to say as our sister has said I have heard but now I see 2 Corinthians 5:1 I love this passage of scripture for notice this earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God so here Paul is picking up St. John 14 and showing us that the place we're going to is not a building like this or the home that you live or the condo or the apartment that you rent, but it's actually a building of God. My mother and father gave me my body. 23 chromosomes from my mother, 23 from my father. They come together and I started being formed in my mother's womb. I got so much of my daddy, so much of my mother. My hands look like my grandfather. The older I get, the more look I look like my daddy. But what about whenever we leave here? So when I go out of this body, do I have to wait for my mama and daddy to give me another body? No. You see, mama and daddy gave me a mortal realm that my soul could live in. For what purpose? So I could take with me the correct thing to go on the other side. If time would terry in a few generations, Sister Patty Cooper's name will be hardly any more than a memory. There will be people that'll walk in the cemetery where we'll take the body to tomorrow and they'll walk by there and maybe stop and look and say, "Patty Cooper, born on a certain day, died on a certain day. Wonder who she was. Wonder what she ever done." They might try to Google her and find maybe where we had this funeral service and they think she must not amounted to much. It depends on who you ask. You see, I think our brothers already said it very well. The flag was not flown at half mass today in Washington, nor in our capital in Nashville. But when our sister got ready to pass over, I guarantee you there was quite a crowd awaiting for her. She had no siblings in this life, no brothers and no sisters. But let me tell you, she is part of the biggest family that you can imagine in your life. It's the children of God whom he forneew before the foundation of the world. And when she was stepping out of that old ship of Zion, I can imagine, oh, it ain't been that long ago in the way that God would count time. But all of them brothers and sisters, true brothers and sisters of the family of God, were rushing down there to meet her that day. Paul goes on to say that this body is like a tabernacle. So it if it were dissolved, notice how he frames this now. This body that we love, this body that we feed and nurture and take care of, yet the ultimate end for us all is disillusion and breaking up and the body going back to the dust of the earth. We idolize it. We comb every hair. We want to look just as good as we can, but ultimately we're headed back for dust. But I'm so glad that's not our end. But we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. So this mortal life is a pilgrimage and our body is a tent. Now remember Paul part of his occupation was he was a tent maker. So as he would sew those tents and take those skins and material and they would manufacture them, no doubt for people that were wealthy and they would want us a certain type of a tent with particular threads and particular sewings. And you would know a person was a wealthy individual by the color of their tent because they could only afford the poor people could not afford certain dyes such as blues and crimsons and reds and scarlets. So you saw somebody with a scarlet tent, you saw somebody with an indigo blue tent, you know they were very wealthy. They were identified by the color of their tent. So Paul, the revelation must have struck his heart. I I see it. So this body is like a tent. And what is a tent? A temporary dwelling. So Paul would make tents for people. They would come in, buy them, pay them for them. They would take them out. They would take them, set them up. What for? Just for a temporary season. They have no foundation, no footer. They're not put together with staples or with wood glue or nothing like that. Held up by the sides with poles. And they take them down and move them here and move them there. What is a tent? A temporary structure. And it struck him. So that's what this body is. It's just a tent. And then heavenly revelation struck his soul and he realized, but there is a house. &gt;&gt; Notice he doesn't say that place there is a tent, but a house. A house. And he says it was eternal in the heavens. So our present bodies are only tabernacles of tents that house our soul. Friends, in verse two, he says, "For in this we groan earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven." I know sister Patty has heard me preach on this scripture over and over and over again. But Sister Patty could tell you something tonight about this scripture &gt;&gt; that I can't tell you. &gt;&gt; I believe it because I've heard it for years. She could say, "I believed it cuz I heard it." &gt;&gt; But if she could take this microphone tonight, she could say, "Brother Donnie, I have heard &gt;&gt; but now I see." &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm waiting for, friends. I don't want to just hear about it. I want to see it. She has heard, but now she sees. Notice this. Paul says, "Therefore, we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. For we walk by faith and not by sight. And we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. No doubt she heard this scripture as well. For I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand. A metaphor that Paul used of the ships being loosed from the mooring. Now remember didn't have buses and airplanes in that dream. Paul made a not a lot of trips on the commercial ships and he would step up on there and they could saw the moorings and they would have them big massive ropes and they had the ship tied there as they was lading it down with goods and all types of things. And Paul would walk up there and the believers would be on the shore and he'd be waving goodbye to them. We'll see you later Paul. God bless you. And Paul would stand there. God bless you. Saints of Ephesus, God bless you. Saints of Kepernam, God bless you. Saints of Thessalonica. If I don't see again, I'll see on the other side. And they'd loose the ship. And they'd still be waving, waving, waving, the voice getting fainter and fainter. And again, Paul thought that's what life is. So I know my the time is close. And remember, he's a Roman citizen. They kill you. For a Roman citizen, your deaths was one thing. They remove your head, decapitate you. But Paul looked at it this way. My time is at hand. I'm ready to be offered. Can you imagine a man using a word like a sacrifice? Now, it's not an offering for sin, but symbolism of a drink offering. So Paul said, "My life is going to be poured out." Oh, but I don't worry. You imagine he could lay his head right down in that cradle just like that and look at that man with that broad axe in his hands and say, "Go ahead, buddy. Take it off." Cuz it won't hit the ground or the basket until I'll be in a body that you'll never be able to touch. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Paul could say, "I wrote about those mansions. I wrote about those bodies. I was carried up there. I heard. But now I see." She heard, oh glory, that there was a land beyond the river. She heard me preach a bunch of funerals. She heard no doubt different songs about how beautiful heaven must be. She heard about beyond the curtain of time. Must have imagined in her mind what would it be like? But now she has seen. Oh hallelujah. Pardon me for a moment as I leave your audience. Sister Patty, I'd like to know tonight, how is it? Is it beyond what you thought? Oh, Brother Donnie, you've preached it since you were an 18-year-old boy. You've sung about it. You've talked about it. But I'm going to tell you, Brother Donnie, you can't even imagine how beautiful that it is. And I want to let you know, Brother Donnie, it wasn't too long after I crossed over, I saw this beautiful young girl, and her hair was hanging way down her back. And she kept running up to me and said, "Sister Patty, Sister Patty." And I might say, "Sister Patty, who was it?" Oh, Brother Donnie, it was Erica. I saw her. I've done seen Brother Calvin. I've seen Brother Daniel Nunley. I've seen this one. I've seen that one. I've seen loved ones. I've seen friends. Sister Pat, if you would have something you'd want me to tell your family tonight, what would it be? Tell them to press on, brother D. Tell them. Don't just say that they can have heard about it, but tell them they want to be able to see it so they can say what I said when I stepped out of that ship and I run my fingers through that blueg grass as it was blowing across. I've always loved flowers, but I saw yellows like I've never seen before. And it seemed like the blue, the azure blue of the sky was bluer than anything I've ever seen. The greens had such depth it seemed as if though they were dimensional looking at them that they would get deeper and deeper. And the blues and the violets and the purples, it was unbelievable. Sister Patty, are you tired? Are you kidding? I've not even stopped running yet. I'm shaking hands and hugging one another's necks. And there's no place to go and nobody has a clock. And nobody has a watch. I have heard. But now I see. Until dawn, I'll be waiting for him. Tell him I'll be waiting. It won't be but just a few more settings of the sun that he'll be able to say the same thing. I have heard but now I see it's barriets. Oh Jesus, we long to see that place. Lord, we know the very best this life can offer. It would be like a landfill or a dump. The birds are in the garbage going through scraps looking for a bite. Rats, cockroaches, it smells. That's the best that this life can offer. than if someone reached down and picked us up and brought us to a land where there's no more death, no more sighing, no more sorrow, and we were young again and never get old and there's no pain, no little children born blind. Lord, we could not by no means but have no desire to call our sister back. Just by what little bit she's seen already, she wouldn't want to come back. And yet we know your word says precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. But Father, we also know it makes such an empty spot in our hearts. So we pray you'd be mindful of us tonight. We pray for our precious brother Don, family members and friends. Dear God, would you just wrap your arms around each one that's grieving tonight, comfort them, Lord Jesus, as only you can do. May there not be a one of us missing at that day Lord that we will be able to stand and say one day too I have heard but now I see. Thank you father in Jesus name. [Music] I know your life on earth was troubled and only You could know the pain. You weren't afraid to face the devil. You were no stranger to the rain. the glorest high on that mountain. [Music] Child, your work on earth is done. Go to heaven or shout. [Music] Love for the Father and the Son. Oh, how we cried the day you left us. We gathered around your grave to grieve.
