[10:26] renounce the name of
[10:30] Christ one by
[10:34] one they chose to

[16:23] more time we're just going to ask
[16:24] brother Dy to come we're going to be in
[16:26] prayer for him as he speaks we'll just
[16:28] turn over
[16:34] him praise the
[16:36] Lord so our hope is in him
[16:40] tday imagine if our Hope was just in all
[16:45] that we could see around
[16:47] us Carol and I was talking about it
[16:50] yesterday our U political scene is in
[16:54] such chaos and our world is in such
[16:57] chaos disease trouble heartache if that
[17:02] was our only hope honestly don't what
[17:04] we'd have to live for if you could just
[17:07] imagine all the diseases and things that
[17:10] face us especially get a little bit
[17:12] older like I am you don't think about it
[17:15] when you're your age but whenever you go
[17:17] to getting older and you think oh my
[17:19] goodness what lays before me
[17:23] dementia car wreck falling getting hurt
[17:27] you say oh no
[17:30] but I'm so grateful that no matter what
[17:32] happens to us physically our hope is in
[17:35] him and we have a better
[17:38] world so let me say U how much I
[17:40] appreciate the the brothers on the music
[17:43] brother JC doing the singing and we give
[17:45] them a s
[17:50] God we know that music is a very
[17:53] important part of a service a matter of
[17:55] fact the prophet told us that that's
[17:57] what that armies do whenever they would
[17:59] go out before the battle they would sing
[18:02] and it makes such a difference in the in
[18:05] the service and we're not Church of
[18:07] Christ around years so we really like
[18:09] music so we certainly appreciate all the
[18:11] effort of our brothers putting forth to
[18:14] make it nice for us oh we'll we'll pick
[18:17] up on the question that um the last one
[18:20] that I dealt with um is it wrong to wear
[18:25] mascara
[18:26] SL D Al es I know many women dye their
[18:31] eyelashes black to avoid wearing mascara
[18:35] but are you not achieving the same goal
[18:38] I wear mascara sometimes but feel people
[18:41] look at that differently than dying your
[18:44] eyelashes are they both wrong question
[18:47] mark or neither question mark let's pray
[18:51] together just ask the Lord to help us
[18:54] tonight Lord Jesus we thank you for the
[18:57] opportunity that we can be together
[18:59] again as brother Paul has already said
[19:02] father we're thankful for the service
[19:04] last night I know it was serious it was
[19:08] um soul searching and Carol and I were
[19:11] talking about it as we went home and I
[19:13] told her I said no doubt every person
[19:15] sitting there in church T not filled
[19:16] with the Holy Ghost but they still just
[19:19] looking just to make sure and dear God
[19:22] we realize that it's too serious a thing
[19:25] for us to play with it our soul our
[19:28] destiny lays before us and we're
[19:31] thankful that you've sent us a word in
[19:33] this day that would help us to prepare
[19:36] father many of these questions that
[19:38] we've dealt with so far have been about
[19:42] is this wrong or that wrong and it's
[19:45] something on the hearts of your people
[19:48] as it was when the prophet started
[19:50] dealing with these questions back in
[19:53] 1953 again in 54 and 57 59 61 63 64
[20:01] every now and then he would do it
[20:02] because he wanted to see he said what
[20:05] was on the church's mind and many of
[20:07] them were not just doctrinal things but
[20:11] they were about is this wrong or is it
[20:13] wrong to do that we want to be right
[20:16] it's our heart's desire I pray that
[20:18] you'd help me tonight Lord that I can be
[20:21] able to answer them in a way that'll be
[20:23] pleasing to you bless each of us as we
[20:26] sit together in Jesus name
[20:29] amen God bless you thank you for coming
[20:31] tonight you can you can be
[20:34] seated I'd like to uh start out with
[20:38] this one and read to you this quote um
[20:41] so you women that likes to put on paint
[20:45] you know where it come from it's excuse
[20:49] me it's a heathen
[20:52] worship it's a heathen worship that's
[20:57] exactly right keep it off of you it's
[21:00] not becoming to Christians now what I
[21:04] find amazing is about some of the things
[21:06] that brother brandham said doctrinally
[21:09] or even morally and he would say
[21:13] something like this it's a heathen
[21:16] worship and then people think where in
[21:19] the world did he get that but I'll tell
[21:22] you what I found amazing as I go on and
[21:26] steud and steud and and study I find
[21:30] more and more I really don't need the
[21:34] validation of um an encyclopedia or the
[21:37] validation of a dictionary to back up
[21:40] what the prophet taught but I know that
[21:43] it helps actually helps some people uh
[21:46] but whenever I begin to look at these
[21:48] various things I think wow so he was
[21:51] right exactly right but yet whenever you
[21:54] go to tying it back so let's read 2
[21:57] Kings chapter
[21:59] 9:30 and when J was come to jezrael
[22:02] Jezebel heard of it and she painted her
[22:05] face and tired her head that don't mean
[22:09] she put a 14inch tire on the top of her
[22:11] head but she was combing her hair and
[22:14] trying to make herself look very
[22:17] seductive by this time
[22:19] Jezebel uh as far as her age would have
[22:23] been in her late 40s or early 50s J was
[22:27] a much younger man but she still felt
[22:29] like apparently that she had the ability
[22:33] to be able to Swoon him with her
[22:36] appearance and with her looks so as we
[22:39] can see from this pattern that there is
[22:42] something about a woman's looks that can
[22:46] be a seductive tool or it can be a tool
[22:51] a gift that God gave her and she can be
[22:54] able to give that to her husband and be
[22:57] a testimony to the to the kingdom of God
[23:00] either way it's whichever one you want
[23:01] to use it God put a gift in my life to
[23:04] be able to speak to people I know of
[23:07] some preachers that have backslid I know
[23:08] of one particular preacher that I'm
[23:10] thinking about right now preached the
[23:12] message for years and years he's
[23:13] actually preached for us several times
[23:15] years ago and U he got got away from the
[23:19] Lord backslid but that man still has the
[23:23] ability to speak as a matter of fact the
[23:26] last video that I saw of him speaking he
[23:30] was standing behind a bar because he's
[23:33] become a
[23:35] bartender and he was teaching people how
[23:39] to introduce people who love to drink
[23:42] alcohol to vodka because vodka is such a
[23:46] strong drink so he was taking his
[23:48] ability and as I watched him someone had
[23:50] sent me the video and as I watched him
[23:53] and I could still see the same
[23:55] mannerisms that I saw in him when he
[23:57] preached I could see this ability to be
[24:02] able to influence people and it just
[24:05] absolutely broke my heart to see it
[24:08] Elvis Presley learned how to sing
[24:10] anybody know where Assembly of God
[24:12] Church in Memphis Tennessee brother Bram
[24:14] said he knew his Pastor knew his family
[24:16] and them so when Elvis sold out his
[24:20] gifts then what did he do he didn't stop
[24:23] dancing he just start changed Partners
[24:26] so instead of dancing in the presence of
[24:28] the Lord Lord he started doing it all
[24:30] over the scenes and all over the world
[24:31] all over the auditoriums and things like
[24:33] that so he took his gift that God gave
[24:37] him sold it out to the devil well it's
[24:40] the same thing you know um you young men
[24:43] that are fine handsome looking man it
[24:45] don't mean that you've got to get a get
[24:47] a can opener and scrape up your face and
[24:50] you know be all ugly you sisters don't
[24:52] have to come in stringy headed and think
[24:55] well it's a curse to be beautiful and
[24:56] I'm going to get a butcher knife and I'm
[24:58] going to put X's and O's on my face you
[25:00] don't have to do that but you can be
[25:02] able to use that and and allow God to be
[25:05] able to bless it so that you can be an
[25:07] example of a very pretty woman or an
[25:10] attractive woman that does not use it as
[25:13] bait it's evident that our lord Jesus
[25:17] loves
[25:19] adornment it's evident that our lord
[25:22] Jesus loves color that he loves variety
[25:27] I know y'all think I'm kind of of
[25:28] different anyway but I I just showed
[25:30] Carol before we came to church I'm
[25:32] working on a habitat for a deer that I
[25:34] uh the Lord blessed me with and in
[25:36] Illinois this past fall so I'm working
[25:38] on the base of it and all so I've got
[25:40] all types of little shells and all
[25:43] different types of things out of my
[25:44] basement and I'm just stand there
[25:46] showing her the different colors and you
[25:48] think why didn't God just make them all
[25:50] a drab gray or drab Brown so do them
[25:54] things ever see their self have you ever
[25:56] seen a snail with this little tiny
[25:58] iPhone and he's making these images of
[26:01] himself what about a butterfly what
[26:03] about song birds that are absolutely so
[26:06] beautiful do you reckon the The Little
[26:08] Hummingbird realizes how beautiful his
[26:12] iridescent colors are how that they are
[26:15] blue in certain lights when the light
[26:17] spectrum will change he'll change into a
[26:19] green and then he can go toward a hue
[26:22] which is across between a red and a
[26:24] purple you reckon he's ever even seen
[26:26] that about himself no he doesn't wonder
[26:29] who that was made for the trees the
[26:31] leaves and and the forest where he flies
[26:33] around no God made it for us so for us
[26:37] to think that God is
[26:39] against that is totally wrong but it's
[26:43] what that we use it for now watch
[26:45] whenever she painted her face and want
[26:47] I'm going to share with you tonight is
[26:49] some history but also some things that I
[26:52] found in uh in Bible studies so I want
[26:56] to show you now some of the things I'm
[26:58] going to read to you tonight are from a
[27:00] commentator by the name of Adam Clark
[27:03] which wrote in the
[27:05] 1600s some from Wesley which wrote in
[27:08] the
[27:09] 1700s so this was a common practice
[27:13] among the church for hundreds and
[27:17] hundreds of years until the last day and
[27:22] the Bible says she painted her face you
[27:24] can read with me if you'd like so she
[27:27] died the up
[27:28] and under eyelids a common practice in
[27:32] the East now notice what it's for the
[27:36] effect is to increase the apparent size
[27:40] of the eye to give it an
[27:43] unnatural brilliancy I want you to
[27:46] notice now who it is doing this it's not
[27:49] the daughters of Israel it's not the
[27:51] people of God 2 Kings again chapter 9:30
[27:56] and when jaob was come to jezrael J
[27:58] heard of it and she painted her face and
[28:01] tired her head and looked out the window
[28:04] now I want you to look at the meaning
[28:05] one of the meanings that I found of this
[28:08] word p u
[28:12] w
[28:14] k
[28:18] puke does God have a sense of humor or
[28:23] what I just couldn't believe it
[28:29] I'm still laughing about it as you can
[28:30] see look at the the meaning now of the
[28:35] word
[28:37] puke
[28:39] antimony
[28:41] stibium black
[28:44] paint
[28:46] I
[28:49] cosmetic
[28:51] wow so every woman then that does this
[28:55] actually is putting puke
[28:58] on her
[28:59] eyes that's very sickening is it
[29:03] not now watch it's a favorite eye paint
[29:06] with oriental women even to the present
[29:10] day it is prepared from antimony ore
[29:14] which were pounded it yields a black
[29:18] powder with a metallic brilliancy which
[29:22] was laid upon the eyebrows and eyelashes
[29:25] either in a dry State as a black powder
[29:28] or
[29:30] moistened now this is pre Mary Kay and
[29:35] Maybelline but I want you to notice now
[29:37] these things I'm going to read to you
[29:39] who these people are that did this
[29:43] moistened generally with oil and made
[29:46] into an ointment which is applied with a
[29:48] fine smooth eye pencil of the thickness
[29:53] of an ordinary Goose quill made either
[29:56] of wood metal or Ivory so the edges of
[30:00] the eyelids were blackened all around
[30:04] now men also started doing this as well
[30:08] in Rome it was a fad in the day back
[30:12] when and the object was to heighten the
[30:15] Splendor of the dark Southern eye now to
[30:20] many of you that's never been in part of
[30:22] the Mediterranean world you know it
[30:24] wouldn't mean a whole lot to you but to
[30:27] look at their eyes their eyes their hair
[30:31] they wanted something that would make
[30:33] the eye stick out so they would
[30:36] enlarging the Border or the perimeter so
[30:39] looking at the eyes because eyes can be
[30:43] very seductive eyes can be very
[30:46] communicative in the way that they
[30:48] communicate even in the Song of Solomon
[30:51] whenever the Lord says that speaking to
[30:54] the bride one of your eyes has caught me
[30:58] so eyes can speak volumes so that the
[31:02] edges of the eyelids are blackened all
[31:03] around and the object was to heighten
[31:05] the Splendor of the dark Southern eye
[31:07] and give it so to speak a more deeply
[31:11] glowing fire and to impart a useful
[31:17] appearance that makes sense to me while
[31:19] you see 75 and 80y old women paint all
[31:21] over their face they're trying to look
[31:23] younger ain't they I guess they don't
[31:25] realize in big caverns and then big
[31:27] wrinkles there are still
[31:29] there I tell you what we're waiting for
[31:31] we're waiting for the Lord to take them
[31:33] out of our face aren't we to the whole
[31:36] of the eyelashes even in
[31:40] extreme old
[31:42] age I listen at this rosalini which was
[31:46] an
[31:47] archaeologist found jars with eye paint
[31:52] of this kind and this dated back now
[31:55] listen to the early
[31:58] Egyptian Graves now I want you to think
[32:01] how far back the people have been doing
[32:05] this so they've been searching it's like
[32:07] down through time that there was a
[32:09] search on to modify to change our looks
[32:14] to change our appearance to make it of
[32:17] course
[32:19] exterior instead of Ting something from
[32:24] within now let's just be plain and
[32:26] honest tonight it's a shame really but
[32:30] many times we find it in politics we
[32:32] find it in religion we find it in church
[32:36] that sometimes a more attractive girl
[32:39] will have more friends than a girl
[32:41] that's playing which is very sad a more
[32:45] attractive young man might have more
[32:48] friends and then they can tend to be
[32:51] bullied they can tend to be picked on
[32:55] because of their looks maybe they're a
[32:57] little bit heavier than someone else or
[32:58] maybe they're skinnier it can go either
[33:01] way and yet they get picked on by this
[33:04] one and picked on by that one and most
[33:06] of us probably have been bullied at one
[33:09] time or another in our life I was
[33:11] bullied the whole time I went to school
[33:13] there's one particular boy that picked
[33:15] on me all the time he was meaner than a
[33:18] copperhead and that's
[33:20] mean ever ever time he had the
[33:22] opportunity he was a few years older
[33:24] than me and he was a bully he would cuss
[33:27] me uh more than likely because I was a
[33:30] Christian so I didn't like to play
[33:32] sports but my I had to take Sports in
[33:34] order to be able to go through school so
[33:37] I was playing basketball and he was on
[33:39] the opposing team one day and I had this
[33:42] bad habit and it was
[33:45] this I chewed my tongue gross right so
[33:50] whenever I would I would bounce the
[33:52] basketball I would chew my tongue James
[33:55] Pendleton was his name
[33:58] so he come right by me and took his
[34:01] elbow and hit me right here in the chin
[34:05] he saw what I was doing I nearly cut my
[34:08] tongue off well I'm so glad I
[34:11] didn't I've needed it my whole life I've
[34:14] still got the scars there but it almost
[34:17] I almost bit my tongue in two and since
[34:22] then it's always made me very defensive
[34:27] of those
[34:28] who become bullied now for those of you
[34:31] that have heard a little bit about the
[34:33] young man that tried to take president
[34:35] former president Trump's life this was
[34:37] part of his background he was bullied in
[34:40] school didn't hardly have any friends
[34:43] nobody liked him he was a loner he had
[34:46] 27 contacts on his cell phone
[34:52] 207 now I find that sad you know what I
[34:55] find even more sad is whenever we would
[34:58] have young people or older people that
[35:00] feel that way when they come to church
[35:04] it's very sad because it's something
[35:07] that tends to carry over so what does it
[35:09] make them want to do if we don't feel
[35:12] accepted if we don't feel liked or loved
[35:15] then we think why should I even go back
[35:17] I'm not even going back no more well I
[35:19] hope and pray that we never May anyone
[35:22] feel like that in our church no matter
[35:25] what color their skin is no no matter
[35:27] how much money they make no matter if
[35:30] they've got a slight stutter or if
[35:33] they're fat or skinny or ugly or
[35:36] whatever they are I hope we can realize
[35:38] and look at them as a soul inside of
[35:42] that body any of you all ever been
[35:44] bullied or ever left out and you know
[35:47] maybe you're not the special kid and you
[35:49] know they always pick everybody but you
[35:52] on the soccer and everybody but you on
[35:54] the basketball anybody ever been there I
[35:56] have on all the the above I was ugly I
[35:59] was poor I wore blue jeans that had
[36:02] holes in them before they were in
[36:05] style I wore the red Dollar Store tennis
[36:08] shoes before they were in style they
[36:11] cost $150 I was laughed at made fun of
[36:16] ridiculed as a matter of fact I had a
[36:18] flashback of it yesterday as I was
[36:21] talking to someone on the phone and I
[36:23] could see myself on the Wayne County
[36:26] Elementary School playground I was in
[36:30] grade two I could remember is right
[36:33] brother Joe I was there again standing
[36:35] out there in that playground wishing I
[36:38] had somebody that would speak to me
[36:41] somebody that would play with me third
[36:43] grade fourth grade fifth grade sixth
[36:45] grade on up till I come to high school
[36:48] then my so-called friends were the guys
[36:51] who brought Playboy magazines to school
[36:54] and would get me down in the concrete
[36:56] floor and I would close my eyes and they
[36:58] would take their fingers and pull my
[37:01] eyes apart like this they were the ones
[37:04] that supposedly were my friends you can
[37:07] imagine how my enemies treated me so
[37:10] I've never really appreciated anybody
[37:14] bullying anybody else and let me just
[37:17] say it because we've got adults at
[37:19] stream in the service tonight I will not
[37:23] tolerate as the pastor people bullying
[37:27] people that come to our
[37:30] church
[37:32] hello so if you're a bully brother Don's
[37:35] got your number don't do it
[37:38] here cuz if need be I'll call your name
[37:42] and I'll call your parents name and if
[37:45] that don't work I'll call your grandma's
[37:48] name honestly you see what happens is
[37:52] that socially it comes to that spot to
[37:55] where the people feel the on the outside
[37:59] and then what do they do they go to
[38:00] doing things to be accepted so they'll
[38:03] act weird sometimes they'll act strange
[38:06] just today they found out some of the
[38:08] post of this 20-year-old young man that
[38:12] tried to assassinate former president
[38:14] Trump and he said that what this certain
[38:16] certain thing this is going to be his
[38:19] Premiere what's he looking for
[38:22] attention
[38:23] attention you know it's a great thing to
[38:26] be talented we have got some of those
[38:28] talented singers here in our church
[38:29] talented musicians wonderful I'm so
[38:32] grateful to God for them and yet there's
[38:34] other people they're not talented solo
[38:37] singers but they might be able to blend
[38:40] in on a choir that's me I'm talking
[38:43] about now you know be able to blend in
[38:45] with 50 voices and hopefully the other
[38:47] 49 will sing louder than they do and yet
[38:50] them type of people can feel left out
[38:53] they can feel left out of this and left
[38:55] out of that so whenever we look and see
[38:58] what people were looking for and again I
[39:01] I remind you of this quote where the
[39:03] Prophet said that it's a heathen worship
[39:06] so watch in Isaiah 3:16 moreover the
[39:10] Lord sayth because the daughters of Zion
[39:13] are
[39:15] hay they walk with stretched forth
[39:20] necks and wanting
[39:23] eyes now here is a a posture about their
[39:28] body that is not natural it's something
[39:32] that they're doing to enhance the way
[39:36] they walk and they walked with stretched
[39:38] forth necks and Wen eyes walking and
[39:44] mincing as they go now they would
[39:47] actually put bracelets on their
[39:51] ankles and it was a sign of
[39:54] decoration but they would also
[39:58] put either silver or gold or metallic
[40:02] types of bells on the bottom of it and
[40:06] it would tinkle as they would
[40:10] go notice he says walking and mincing as
[40:15] they go which is a manner of walking
[40:17] making a
[40:20] tinkling with their
[40:22] feet now was this for uh some some type
[40:27] of
[40:29] therapy was this for pain maybe in their
[40:35] joints y'all ain't
[40:37] laughing was for this for some type of
[40:40] uh I don't know what it was they had
[40:43] plantar
[40:44] fasciatus and they're tinkling and it's
[40:46] making their feet feel better what's it
[40:48] for all of these things that Isaiah
[40:51] mentioned is to draw
[40:54] attention so people will not only look
[40:58] at them but they will hear them as they
[41:01] see them coming so it's something to
[41:04] draw attention and why and what for in a
[41:08] wrongful
[41:10] way so the tarum now the tarum anybody
[41:13] ever heard the tarum you know what the
[41:14] tarum is no okay so the tarum was a book
[41:18] which was written after the uh pente
[41:22] which is the first five books of Moses
[41:24] so it's a it's an ancient Hebrew Book
[41:27] uh so this is the name that they gave it
[41:30] so the taram says they walk with their
[41:33] eyes painted as Jezebel painted her face
[41:39] in the talmudic language and the talud
[41:43] is another word for the first five books
[41:44] of Moses is used for Vermilion now
[41:48] Vermilion was a red dye or a red lead
[41:52] with which they painted their eyes as
[41:54] they did also with black lead now this
[41:59] was not a custom that the children of
[42:02] Israel had from God that God said hey
[42:04] daughters this is no problem y'all go
[42:06] ahead and do it but what happened was
[42:08] after they got in their land then the
[42:11] daughters of Israel began to take on the
[42:13] same Customs as the other people look in
[42:16] Ezekiel CH
[42:18] 23: 40 furthermore that you have sent
[42:22] for men to come from afar unto whom a
[42:26] messenger was sent and lo they came for
[42:30] whom thou didst wash
[42:34] thyself
[42:36] paint thy eyes and deck
[42:40] thyself with
[42:42] ornaments now by the time we get to the
[42:44] prophecy of Ezekiel both Israel and
[42:47] Judah remember there was one one nation
[42:50] originally called Israel but then there
[42:53] become a division after the domain of
[42:56] Solomon and God divided the kingdom and
[42:59] one was called Judah and the other was
[43:01] called Israel Judah had their prophets
[43:04] Israel had their prophets God even spoke
[43:06] to them separately and God dealt with
[43:09] them separately which is so sad that's
[43:12] why God's against splits and churches
[43:14] because that's exactly what it causes
[43:16] but by the time we get to the Book of
[43:18] Ezekiel then we see they were just about
[43:21] at the state of total rejection from God
[43:26] so God said whenever he saw them he
[43:29] passed by them and when they come out of
[43:31] the land of Egypt whenever they were
[43:33] born they had no one to wipe the
[43:35] afterbirth off of them no one salted
[43:39] them which was a custom in that day no
[43:41] one suppled them but God said I passed
[43:44] by thee and I saw thee and thy blood
[43:47] Ezekiel 16 I saw thee and thy blood and
[43:51] I said live y I say unto thee live and
[43:54] God said you started growing up and your
[43:57] hair grew out and God began to describe
[44:00] her as she come from a child to puberty
[44:03] and then she come into the stage where
[44:06] she was a young woman and she was
[44:08] becoming of a marriageable age so this
[44:12] was under God's love and God's tutorship
[44:15] and then God said when you come to a
[44:18] state of a marriageable age what did you
[44:22] do then you you set along the roadside
[44:26] the Bible can be very plain in the way
[44:28] it says you set along the roadside and
[44:31] you parted your legs for every man to
[44:35] come into you now God was using a
[44:37] natural symbol of a harlot or a
[44:41] prostitute so it was God that raised her
[44:44] God that saved her God that kept her God
[44:46] that moved for her and then once she
[44:49] come to the marriageable age Satan moved
[44:53] in and married her but it wasn't him
[44:56] that rais raised her it wasn't him that
[44:58] took care of her it was God you
[45:01] understand the devil's done that every
[45:03] time in every age that's exactly what he
[45:06] done to even the Garden of Eden it's
[45:07] what he tried to do to Sarah what he
[45:09] tried to do to Rebecca what he did to
[45:11] the Ephesian Church age what he will try
[45:14] to do to our
[45:18] church he will try to do it to every
[45:21] Church in this message and the sad part
[45:24] about it is there will be some mess
[45:26] message people that will fall in love
[45:30] with the devil and they will listen to
[45:32] him because we're at the age of marriage
[45:36] and the Lord nurtured us through
[45:38] justification through sanctification
[45:39] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[45:41] raised us up he give us his Mercy gave
[45:44] us his grace all these great things and
[45:46] here we are at the very age of the
[45:50] marriage and Satan will try to do the
[45:52] exact same thing he did to the children
[45:55] of Israel so by this stage now Israel is
[45:59] acting like a harlot how sad how very
[46:03] very sad thou paint us thine eyes or
[46:06] thyself thine eyes and deck thyself With
[46:09] Thine ornament so here God is making a
[46:11] parallel to the pattern of the way the
[46:14] harlots would do in that day just as
[46:18] harlots do make themselves agreeable to
[46:21] their
[46:23] lovers who use
[46:25] washes and paint as Jezebel did and
[46:30] dress themselves in their best clothes
[46:33] and Adorn themselves in the best manner
[46:36] they can harlots had their particular
[46:41] attire by which they were known they not
[46:44] only use binos which is a form of a bass
[46:49] or bass but washes for their face I want
[46:53] you to notice what they would do they
[46:56] would not if they were prostitute they
[46:57] were Harlot they would not set say a
[47:00] busy intersection and they would sit
[47:02] there and they smell like a pole cat I'm
[47:04] tell you what their hair hadn't been
[47:06] washed in 6 weeks and you get around
[47:08] them and you couldn't even hardly stand
[47:10] to be around them cuz they smelt so
[47:14] bad but they would wash and they would
[47:18] perfume and they would put on
[47:21] makeup and they would make their eyes
[47:24] look very attractive and they would put
[47:26] on their best clothes and they knew
[47:28] exactly no doubt they had designer
[47:31] clothes in them days and they knew
[47:33] exactly how to dress in certain things
[47:36] and they would stand on a certain way in
[47:38] the street what was it
[47:43] advertisement
[47:45] sisters don't put your body up as
[47:49] advertisement your body is a sacred
[47:53] thing God give you this sacred thing of
[47:57] your
[47:59] body oh it just breaks my
[48:02] heart they particularly painted their
[48:05] eyes to make them look larger for large
[48:07] eyes in women in some nations were
[48:12] reckoned very
[48:14] beautiful now in our culture if we would
[48:18] look at that and think good Lord that's
[48:20] scary look at that woman Lord have mercy
[48:24] well more than likely they wouldn't do
[48:25] it here
[48:27] so you see what Satan does is he
[48:30] modifies sin according to your culture
[48:34] even according to your region so where
[48:38] we are here we're of course universities
[48:41] liberals we got a whole whole slew of
[48:43] liberals here in our Tri Cities area
[48:46] there'll be certain things I'll have to
[48:48] preach and certain things I'll have to
[48:49] deal with and our church that say some
[48:52] brothers different parts of the world
[48:54] they're in the Backwoods are not no
[48:56] university around them nowhere and
[48:58] they'll never have to deal with it and
[49:00] they may stream one of our services and
[49:02] say what in the world is brother Donnie
[49:06] having to deal with that for why in the
[49:08] world well we Face certain things in our
[49:11] region and our area that other people
[49:15] won't have to deal with is that right
[49:17] and then there may be certain things
[49:18] that they would have to preach against
[49:21] that we wouldn't have to deal with this
[49:23] is the way Satan will modify sin now
[49:26] watch in in some Nations it was reckoned
[49:28] very beautiful
[49:29] particularly among the Greeks hence Juno
[49:34] history now Juno in Homer is called
[49:40] bolink the ox eyed as some translate it
[49:45] or rather the large eyed Juno and the
[49:49] Grecian women in order to make their
[49:52] eyes large made use of a powder mixed
[49:57] with
[49:58] washes which shrunk their
[50:01] eyebrows and caused their eyes to stand
[50:06] out that that sounds very weird to us I
[50:09] mean it's like oh my goodness why in the
[50:11] world would you want to do that because
[50:13] on their culture it appeared very
[50:18] beautiful sounds like putting a cucumber
[50:21] and a Bass to turn it into a pickle to
[50:23] me it sounds like lime or alum or
[50:26] something
[50:28] you you think what in the world but in
[50:31] their region in their culture they
[50:34] thought it was very attractive I can see
[50:36] this some of you this is the first time
[50:38] you've ever heard this in your entire
[50:40] life but remember the devil that did it
[50:42] to them is still alive today and he will
[50:47] do things in our culture traveling among
[50:51] the
[50:52] Africans and the Asians and different
[50:56] parts of the the world it's amazing what
[50:58] you see and it's amazing the different
[51:01] parts of Africa that I've been in you
[51:04] hardly ever see women in
[51:07] pants going to China you hardly ever see
[51:11] women in dresses now that's coming from
[51:14] the communistic moves where that women
[51:16] and men work in the fields together they
[51:19] dress the same they look the same so for
[51:22] some of the women in China it was a real
[51:26] difficult thing to get them to see the
[51:28] need of wearing dresses why different
[51:31] culture so then the men of God according
[51:33] to the region where they are they would
[51:36] have to tackle some of these things so
[51:38] what Satan do he'll pull things now each
[51:41] church has its own personality the
[51:44] people who come to that church make the
[51:46] personality of the church our church has
[51:49] changed personalities many times since
[51:53] I've been the pastor now it's not that
[51:56] I'm by polar and that I've changed the
[51:58] personality of the church but it's when
[52:01] people move in and they have different
[52:03] views and they have different needs you
[52:06] are what dictates what's preached over
[52:10] the pulpit your needs what you have need
[52:13] of so the personality of our church has
[52:16] changed multiple times I know that it
[52:18] will change again because it's like
[52:20] whenever your mom and dad got married
[52:23] well they took your dad come from a
[52:25] normal in his home your mother come from
[52:27] a normal in her home then they begin to
[52:29] create a new Norm which was part of his
[52:33] normal part of her normal his mom and
[52:36] dad come over and said well son that
[52:38] ain't the way we raised you we didn't do
[52:39] that in our house and then her mom and
[52:42] dad come over and said that's sure ain't
[52:43] the way we done it in our house and she
[52:45] said Mama he don't like it done that way
[52:47] here so what do they do they have a norm
[52:50] they're creating a personality which
[52:52] exists of two people then a baby come
[52:55] along the way well say the first one was
[52:57] a perfect little child it went to bed at
[53:00] 8:00 at night it only woke up to have
[53:03] its diaper changeed and feed you know
[53:06] and it went right back to sleep it slept
[53:08] till 8:00 the next morning Mama's
[53:10] thinking this is so awesome I want
[53:13] another child so she talks Daddy into it
[53:16] they have child number
[53:18] two ah but Child Number Two changed the
[53:24] personality again because child number
[53:27] two after 3 months has
[53:31] colic so it squalls it screams it cries
[53:36] it's up at two then up at 4: then up at
[53:39] 5 Mom and Daddy's trying to find the
[53:41] papers from the hospital to see what a
[53:44] what how long the return policy is on
[53:46] this baby they're trying to see has it
[53:49] expired where they can turn it back they
[53:51] are totally convinced they got the wrong
[53:54] baby there's no way both of them being
[53:57] just next to God himself could have
[53:59] produced such a
[54:04] brat so what did that child do change
[54:07] the personality of the home they're
[54:11] darome to have child number
[54:15] three so you see what Satan does with
[54:18] sin so say we would have an element of
[54:21] people in our church we have some older
[54:23] people in our church they're beyond the
[54:25] makeup day
[54:26] okay forget it they don't even care no
[54:29] more they they they ain't worried about
[54:31] it they ain't worried about if their
[54:32] eyes look that big or that big you know
[54:34] some of them don't know our world are in
[54:35] they get up a world every day but some
[54:38] more of the middleaged well they you
[54:40] know they kind of cater to this and
[54:42] there's some that's younger like you and
[54:44] you're concerned many of you are single
[54:47] you hope that there's a boy out there
[54:49] for you or a girl so you think well what
[54:51] can I do that would make myself stand
[54:55] out a little bit from all the rest of
[54:57] these girls especially them for there
[54:59] they all look the same oh they do
[55:00] they're The Parkers aren't they how can
[55:02] I make myself different why can I do to
[55:04] make myself unique and you see Satan
[55:07] will take that desire to make you look
[55:10] unique and if you're not careful you
[55:12] start leaning just a little bit toward
[55:15] the world well maybe I could just you
[55:18] know do a little this and a little of
[55:20] that nobody would ever know but your
[55:23] reason is what your reason for doing it
[55:27] is
[55:28] what now
[55:30] watch thou paint us th eyes the figure
[55:33] is that of a lwd
[55:37] woman preparing herself now this is not
[55:39] a quote from the message as I said Adam
[55:42] Clark Elliot different commentators this
[55:47] was taught by the Baptist Church years
[55:51] ago this part of this I'm fixing to read
[55:54] to you is from Baptist
[55:57] theology you don't find many of them
[55:59] that believe it now and Methodist
[56:03] Methodist women years ago they ain't no
[56:05] way they'd wear no britches they
[56:07] wouldn't even wear a
[56:08] ring there was a great debate among the
[56:12] Methodist churches years ago if it was a
[56:15] sin for a woman to wear a wedding
[56:19] ring and now the Methodist Church is
[56:22] ordaining gay pastors and lesbians
[56:27] you see how it can
[56:29] change now watch the figure is that of a
[56:32] lwd woman preparing herself for her
[56:36] lover now remember what this symbolism
[56:39] is then a woman painting her face
[56:43] putting on all these things look where
[56:46] it comes from not the church the prophet
[56:50] said it was Heathen worship so it was
[56:53] the symbol of a lwd woman
[56:57] preparing herself for her lover and
[57:00] awaiting his arrival painting the eyes
[57:04] or rather the lids and the lashes was an
[57:08] ancient custom pre Maybelline Prem Mary
[57:13] Kay and the pink
[57:16] Cadillacs still preserved in the East
[57:20] now notice the scripture here paint us
[57:22] thine eyes like a decay
[57:27] Harlot mest up thy defects with paint
[57:32] women throughout the ancient near East
[57:35] regularly enlarged and darkened their
[57:38] eyes with a mixture compounded of olive
[57:40] oil mixed with
[57:44] malachite so we've done looked at they
[57:46] used
[57:47] green black
[57:50] red notice now green or Galina which is
[57:55] black Babylonian sources mention ey
[57:58] paint that included snite antimony
[58:03] talide decorated pallets were used to
[58:07] grind the ore and mix it for application
[58:10] these pallets have been found in many
[58:13] iron two sites listen this
[58:17] shame in
[58:19] Israel including
[58:23] megiddo so these predated
[58:26] Israel coming into the
[58:29] land and then what did the Israelites do
[58:32] they started picking up the customs of
[58:35] Johnson City as we'll say or the customs
[58:39] of Chicago or the customs of Houston or
[58:44] Dallas or
[58:46] Paris it might shock you to know that
[58:48] there are an element of so-called
[58:51] message
[58:53] churches and the pastors in a certain
[58:56] move around this message who do not
[59:00] preach Holiness
[59:01] anymore so their women were high
[59:05] heels they paint their face they cut
[59:08] their
[59:09] hair they look just like any other
[59:12] denominational church and they would
[59:15] look at you all tonight you sisters and
[59:17] they would laugh at you and they most
[59:19] certainly laugh at me because they know
[59:21] who I am and they think they have more
[59:25] like
[59:26] than we do I particularly don't want
[59:29] that light do you they're not getting
[59:32] closer to God they're becoming more like
[59:36] heathens an't that awful to have to say
[59:40] watch this in Ezekiel 23:41 now what's
[59:43] God likening Israel to the pattern of a
[59:48] harlot how awful when the Beloved of
[59:52] God is acting like Street
[59:57] prostitutes thou
[59:59] satest upon a
[1:00:02] stately
[1:00:04] bed I want you to notice now where
[1:00:06] Israel
[1:00:08] is Israel is painting her eyes painting
[1:00:11] her face laring her eyebrows you know
[1:00:14] all these things that she's doing now
[1:00:16] that she's got that done notice where
[1:00:20] she's
[1:00:20] sitting she's
[1:00:22] sitting on a bed it's for for a
[1:00:27] reason it's for a purpose she's not
[1:00:29] sitting at the kitchen
[1:00:31] table she's not sitting outside in a
[1:00:33] garden somewhere she's sitting on a
[1:00:38] stately bed now they would decorate
[1:00:41] their rooms they would decorate their
[1:00:43] beds they would straw Petals of flowers
[1:00:47] they would have perfumes they would have
[1:00:50] candles and different types of things
[1:00:52] that were going and set us upon a
[1:00:55] stately bed
[1:00:56] and a table prepared before it whereupon
[1:01:01] thou Hast set
[1:01:03] mine
[1:01:06] incense and mine
[1:01:08] oil now look the very things that God
[1:01:11] gave them now they're taking it and
[1:01:15] using it to commit
[1:01:18] adultery the adulterous Jerusalem is
[1:01:21] portrayed in much the same light as the
[1:01:25] prostitute
[1:01:26] in Proverbs 710 to 23 now you can write
[1:01:30] that down and read if you'd like both
[1:01:33] seduced their lovers with an inviting
[1:01:37] couch incense and persuasive words prior
[1:01:42] to the helenistic period all references
[1:01:46] to the couch are associated with a
[1:01:49] sleeping chamber 2 Samuel 4:7 Psalm 66
[1:01:55] not the banqueting room incense and oil
[1:01:59] on the table as a part of
[1:02:03] anticipated sexual activity the
[1:02:07] adulterous Jerusalem has perfumed her
[1:02:10] bed chamber with incense Song of Solomon
[1:02:13] chap 1:3 also chap
[1:02:16] 4:10 and has sweet smelling oils at hand
[1:02:20] for anointing her hair and bodies Esther
[1:02:24] 2:12 similar images are found in the
[1:02:28] Egyptian love
[1:02:30] songs discovered by archaeologists in
[1:02:34] the carac temple complex in luxord a few
[1:02:39] years ago carolly and I stood there in
[1:02:42] the carac temple and
[1:02:45] luxur now why am I reading all this so
[1:02:49] you can
[1:02:51] see what has been comes into view again
[1:02:56] but it was not a sign of great great
[1:03:00] signs of education and civilization and
[1:03:03] godliness and Purity it was a sign when
[1:03:07] you go to seeing people doing all of
[1:03:10] this and acting this way and taking this
[1:03:12] image on theirself it was a sign their
[1:03:18] culture their country their
[1:03:21] civilization is coming to an end
[1:03:27] it's a sign of the
[1:03:30] end now they're thinking it's wonderful
[1:03:32] it's great it's magnificent oh my isn't
[1:03:36] that just loyal now remember I I remind
[1:03:38] you of what the prophet said in the
[1:03:40] first quote there that I read that it
[1:03:42] was Heathen
[1:03:45] worship we we'll pick up again on
[1:03:48] another on another
[1:03:50] question this is a very interesting
[1:03:53] question here is it wrong to talk about
[1:03:57] people and their
[1:03:59] lives or is it
[1:04:03] considered
[1:04:06] gossip what is the
[1:04:08] true
[1:04:10] definition of
[1:04:13] Gossip now I won't ask anybody here to
[1:04:16] raise your hands or even bat your eyes
[1:04:20] for the next 10
[1:04:22] minutes do we talk about people
[1:04:26] yes we do is there a way to talk about
[1:04:30] people and their situations with concern
[1:04:35] and it not being gossip yes it is a
[1:04:39] preacher
[1:04:40] sermons are filled with such things
[1:04:45] Carol and I talk about people every day
[1:04:48] of our
[1:04:49] life but not in a way to run them down
[1:04:53] it's about what they're dealing with in
[1:04:54] their home cuz our life are our people
[1:04:59] so it's what they're going through it's
[1:05:01] the sickness that they're dealing with I
[1:05:04] was at on the phone yesterday counseling
[1:05:05] a brother for over an hour here in our
[1:05:08] church I had about a 30 minute break
[1:05:11] then I had to receive a phone call from
[1:05:14] a brother in the UK which considers our
[1:05:17] church his home Church been been
[1:05:19] streaming us for 14 years and me his
[1:05:21] Pastor I was on the phone with him for
[1:05:23] an hour hour and 20 minutes something
[1:05:26] like that what will we talking about
[1:05:28] family issues problems this that the
[1:05:31] other was I gossiping was he gossiping
[1:05:35] no we were trying to resolve some of
[1:05:38] those things listen to the meaning of
[1:05:41] the word gossip or you can read it
[1:05:44] gossip casual or
[1:05:47] unconstrained conversation or
[1:05:51] reports about other people typically
[1:05:56] involving details that are not
[1:05:59] confirmed as being true now that's the
[1:06:03] meaning of Gossip now it can be like you
[1:06:07] know rumors and things like that that
[1:06:09] that happen in in families and and homes
[1:06:13] and clicks um that can happen in church
[1:06:17] well have you heard brother so and so
[1:06:18] done so oh no no if you heard this that
[1:06:21] the other and a lot of it is absolutely
[1:06:24] unconfirmed and probably most of us have
[1:06:26] been as guilty as we can be of spreading
[1:06:29] things that absolutely were not facts
[1:06:33] anybody brave enough to raise your hand
[1:06:35] and say yep been there and done
[1:06:37] that and yet were we wrong in doing that
[1:06:41] absolutely we were wrong but is it wrong
[1:06:44] for us to question and talk you know
[1:06:48] have you heard brother Jesse is going
[1:06:50] through a hard time and you know let
[1:06:52] let's pray for him let's remember him
[1:06:54] and let's let's just hold our brother up
[1:06:56] in prayer is that gossip no that's not
[1:06:59] gossip gossip is you going around hey
[1:07:01] have you heard the latest on Jesse you
[1:07:03] know Jesse I mean he's doing this and
[1:07:05] he's doing that my have you heard and
[1:07:07] then don't tell nobody that's just
[1:07:09] between me and you they get on their
[1:07:11] family chat or their group chat and they
[1:07:13] tell this one that and the other one but
[1:07:15] they couldn't remember exactly what you
[1:07:17] said so then they added this and they
[1:07:19] left that out and by the time they get
[1:07:21] done brother Jesse's got 14 girlfriends
[1:07:24] and three of them you know or just out
[1:07:26] of state two of them is from another
[1:07:28] Nation you know how people are they just
[1:07:30] embellish they add to they take away and
[1:07:33] the before brother Jesse know people in
[1:07:36] the church are treating him so odd and
[1:07:39] he's wondering what in the world is
[1:07:41] going on and they're thinking I cannot
[1:07:43] believe they ask him to lead the singing
[1:07:46] I just I I just I cannot believe it they
[1:07:49] ask him and you may be sitting there
[1:07:50] believing a lie against brother Jesse
[1:07:53] because somebody said something that was
[1:07:55] not the truth have we all done that oh
[1:07:58] yeah sure we have I'll go ahead and
[1:08:00] answer for you yeah brother Donnie we've
[1:08:02] all done that thank you and is that
[1:08:05] wrong that's wrong that is absolutely
[1:08:08] wrong and we shouldn't do it and when I
[1:08:11] say we I'm talking about from here back
[1:08:16] watch this in Leviticus
[1:08:19] 19:16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a
[1:08:24] tail Bearer
[1:08:26] among thy people neither shalt thou
[1:08:29] stand against the blood of thy neighbor
[1:08:32] I am the Lord Proverbs
[1:08:36] 11:13 a tail Bearer reveales
[1:08:41] Secrets but he that is of a faithful
[1:08:46] Spirit con
[1:08:48] Sealth the
[1:08:51] matter praise the
[1:08:53] Lord let me just be honest with you and
[1:08:55] tell you there are people that have flew
[1:08:58] here to our state to come and receive
[1:09:02] counsel from your pastor from all over
[1:09:05] the world I have been told secrets about
[1:09:09] people's
[1:09:11] lives that if I told them it would cause
[1:09:17] murders it would cause all kinds of
[1:09:22] things but I want to be a man
[1:09:26] of a faithful
[1:09:29] spirit that the kind of Pastor you want
[1:09:32] would you all want so you come and talk
[1:09:34] to me about a sin or whatever and and
[1:09:37] then the next thing you know somebody
[1:09:39] from my family is telling the thing that
[1:09:42] you supposedly told me in confidence
[1:09:44] anybody here want that to happen to you
[1:09:47] you know what me either so I treat you
[1:09:51] the way I would want to be treated so if
[1:09:54] it was in reverse and brother Joe was
[1:09:56] the pastor and I I wanted to come and
[1:09:58] said brother Joe I I've done something
[1:10:00] terrible wrong buddy pray for me please
[1:10:02] pray for me and then the next time I
[1:10:04] come to church brother Joe's son comes
[1:10:07] up and and then brother Joe's close
[1:10:09] friend I think my goodness and believe
[1:10:12] it or not I have people from other
[1:10:15] churches to come and ask counsel and
[1:10:17] advice and I've heard this over and over
[1:10:20] again and I always tell them look I
[1:10:22] don't I don't like talking to people
[1:10:23] from another church but they said
[1:10:25] brother Donnie we cannot go to our
[1:10:29] pastor because our pastor tells his wife
[1:10:33] everything and then she shares it with
[1:10:35] her
[1:10:36] children and we cannot feel comfortable
[1:10:39] going
[1:10:40] there that is a shame I said that is a
[1:10:45] shame so if I or you are telling things
[1:10:50] spreading things on other
[1:10:53] people we shouldn't do it it's wrong
[1:10:55] it displeases the Lord notice in
[1:10:58] Proverbs 188 the words of a tail bear
[1:11:02] are as wounds and they go down into the
[1:11:06] innermost
[1:11:07] parts of the belly oh my goodness I have
[1:11:12] been lied on I've had so many things
[1:11:15] told on
[1:11:16] me someone used to come to our church
[1:11:18] and left several years ago they went
[1:11:21] about telling on me that I had been
[1:11:23] married twice
[1:11:27] now I I'm I'm sure I'm 68 years old and
[1:11:30] I'm sure that I have forgotten a few
[1:11:33] things about my life but I honestly
[1:11:36] don't see how I could have forgotten
[1:11:38] that especially since I married that
[1:11:40] woman when I was 16 so I must have been
[1:11:43] really young when I married the other
[1:11:45] one now can you imagine why would
[1:11:49] anybody tell such a thing an outright
[1:11:53] lie why would they tell it
[1:11:56] why but in one way I considered an honor
[1:12:00] that people have to make up things about
[1:12:02] me I'm grateful that I live that close
[1:12:05] to God you ought to be grateful you
[1:12:08] ought to be grateful that they can't go
[1:12:10] around and say hey you know what I heard
[1:12:12] I heard brother Donnie's drinking
[1:12:13] whiskey again oh man I heard it there
[1:12:16] somebody told a member of our church not
[1:12:19] long
[1:12:20] ago that they was going to have to get
[1:12:22] him a new pastor he said why said well
[1:12:25] the pastor every time we have a party or
[1:12:27] something he gets so drunk you know it's
[1:12:30] it's just really bringing a reproach huh
[1:12:32] you think you've got to be kidding me so
[1:12:35] the pastors getting drunk at the church
[1:12:38] gatherings I can believe it friends I
[1:12:40] can believe that what an age that we're
[1:12:43] living in what an age so these are what
[1:12:47] the words of a tail Bearer do believe me
[1:12:50] if it was not for the grace of God
[1:12:52] tonight I could not even stand before
[1:12:54] you
[1:12:56] of the things that have been told about
[1:12:57] me and I'm sure some of you could stand
[1:13:00] and say brother Donnie I I know a little
[1:13:02] bit of what you're going through cuz the
[1:13:04] things that people have said about me
[1:13:06] and you know what's so hurtful sometimes
[1:13:09] it's people you go to church
[1:13:11] with people that you love you say why
[1:13:14] would they do that why because as
[1:13:19] Christians were still humans come on now
[1:13:21] can anybody say Amen the words of a the
[1:13:25] tail bear are as wounds they go down
[1:13:27] into the innermost parts of the belly
[1:13:31] Proverbs 20 and 19 he that goeth about
[1:13:35] as a tail bear ralth Secrets therefore
[1:13:40] medle not with
[1:13:43] him that flattereth
[1:13:45] with his lips Proverbs
[1:13:49] 2620 where there I love this it's so
[1:13:53] simple where no w wood
[1:13:56] is there the fire goeth out now this is
[1:14:01] the man of great wisdom but he had some
[1:14:04] very simple things to say didn't he I
[1:14:06] mean this takes a rocket scientist to
[1:14:08] figure this out right where there is no
[1:14:10] wood your fire is going to go out and he
[1:14:14] says so where there is no tail
[1:14:18] Bearer The
[1:14:21] Strife ceaseth
[1:14:25] mm right notice this in the church in
[1:14:28] his condition walk meekly gently humbly
[1:14:33] gently and the dove will lead you but
[1:14:37] whenever you go to listening to that
[1:14:40] gossip whenever you go to getting that
[1:14:43] temper up when you go to thinking you
[1:14:45] got a right to do this and do that the
[1:14:48] dove takes her
[1:14:50] flight and goes on away I don't know
[1:14:54] about you
[1:14:55] I need my Dove every day every hour I
[1:15:00] don't want to do anything say anything
[1:15:03] oh my that would make it why because the
[1:15:06] Holy Spirit does not love and
[1:15:11] enjoy gossip and talking now let me just
[1:15:15] give you a little bit of insight about
[1:15:17] preachers
[1:15:18] okay as as preachers we talk about
[1:15:22] things whenever I will meet together
[1:15:24] with preach preachers and brothers will
[1:15:26] come through and preach for us and and
[1:15:29] uh I don't I don't like meeting with
[1:15:32] them and talking about church issues and
[1:15:35] church problems I want them to be able
[1:15:37] to just preach what the Lord puts on
[1:15:39] their heart and just keep it that way
[1:15:41] and and I that's the same way I love
[1:15:44] preaching at churches and I have
[1:15:46] preached in churches before and Carol's
[1:15:49] been with me I was at a place a few
[1:15:51] years ago and I was up preaching and the
[1:15:54] pastor was glory to God Amen Hallelujah
[1:15:58] he was up and about all over the floor
[1:16:01] until I started dealing with some
[1:16:03] certain things and whenever I did that
[1:16:06] Pastor sat down and never opened his
[1:16:10] mouth and I thought rut
[1:16:13] R Shaggy we're in a
[1:16:17] mess so I thought oh my
[1:16:20] goodness after service he come to me and
[1:16:24] he said I'm sure you noticed I got quiet
[1:16:27] and I said yes sir I did I said I I hope
[1:16:30] everything was all right he said brother
[1:16:32] Donnie he said you repeated some words
[1:16:37] that I said to a brother day before
[1:16:41] yesterday he said you also repeated his
[1:16:44] reply back to me and he said I just knew
[1:16:49] he was going to know that I had talked
[1:16:52] to you and told you that
[1:16:55] we believe the Holy Ghost can do that I
[1:16:57] guarantee I got an email from one of the
[1:16:59] sisters of our church not long ago and
[1:17:01] she Saidi want to know is our church
[1:17:05] bugged and she had a question mark then
[1:17:07] she you know put a few dots and then
[1:17:09] said haha she said me and sister so and
[1:17:12] so were standing talking the other day
[1:17:15] and we said such and such and so and so
[1:17:18] I said this and she said this and she
[1:17:20] said two Services after that you stood
[1:17:23] up and repeated the very same words that
[1:17:26] both of us said I believe the Holy Ghost
[1:17:29] can still do that don't you
[1:17:32] absolutely but when preachers will get
[1:17:36] together and we'll go to talking about
[1:17:38] this is going on in the message and you
[1:17:40] know this is going on it's such a
[1:17:42] delicate thing to where that you're not
[1:17:46] speaking out of concern and no doubt the
[1:17:48] men of God in every age has done that to
[1:17:51] where you cross that line and it's it's
[1:17:54] like it's an Unwritten line it's an
[1:17:56] Undeclared boundary that you cross over
[1:18:00] and you go to entering into gossip
[1:18:03] you're talking about this one you're
[1:18:04] talking about that one have y'all ever
[1:18:06] been there not not his preachers Ju Just
[1:18:09] his Ley and you get concerned you know
[1:18:12] have you heard this and this is going oh
[1:18:14] my you know I hear some of the young
[1:18:16] Brothers in our church is getting a
[1:18:18] little bit indifferent and cold y'all
[1:18:20] never discuss things like that some of
[1:18:22] our young sisters is that wrong no as
[1:18:25] long as your motive and your objective
[1:18:26] is right do what I do whenever I know
[1:18:30] that I'm going to meet with the brothers
[1:18:31] and we may go to talk this is what I do
[1:18:34] Lord Jesus Keep Me sensitive that I'll
[1:18:38] know if I get close to that boundary to
[1:18:42] where I I I move across the necessity to
[1:18:46] discuss this and discuss that and it can
[1:18:49] lay so close to gossip and talking about
[1:18:53] this one and running that one down now
[1:18:55] y'all know what I'm talking about don't
[1:18:56] you I believe if the Lord Jesus would
[1:18:59] have his prophet and have this written
[1:19:01] in the Bible that he would want us to be
[1:19:04] sensitive enough to where we could walk
[1:19:06] there is anybody here besides me ever
[1:19:10] stepped across that line and you give
[1:19:12] would give anything if you wish should
[1:19:15] have never said it and it just like you
[1:19:18] didn't you didn't see it you you wasn't
[1:19:19] even aware of that you were doing it and
[1:19:22] you were just talking and all of a
[1:19:24] sudden you realize you was in an area
[1:19:28] and you don't know how to get out you
[1:19:30] can't retract the words that oh Lord
[1:19:33] speak to us tonight
[1:19:35] Jesus I believe that's the kind of
[1:19:37] Christians the Lord wants us to be don't
[1:19:39] you to where we can be so sensitive in
[1:19:42] one way I'm glad it didn't give us a
[1:19:45] book and just say now look you can say
[1:19:48] this and this and this but don't say
[1:19:49] that and that and that you understand
[1:19:51] what he wants us to be young people he
[1:19:53] wants us he don't just want that for
[1:19:55] your moms and dads and your grandpas he
[1:19:57] wants this with you he wants you to be
[1:19:59] able to walk so close to him that his
[1:20:02] spirit in you can help you and guard you
[1:20:05] and even if you start toward that
[1:20:07] boundary of whatever it is right and
[1:20:10] wrong about how to dress and how to do
[1:20:12] this and do that even how to talk and
[1:20:15] you feel yourself nearing that boundary
[1:20:18] that you just feel that warning and you
[1:20:20] just back away oh my that's what kind of
[1:20:23] Christian I want to be
[1:20:26] let me let me read this some we'll
[1:20:27] close that's what the Holy
[1:20:31] Ghost is
[1:20:33] for it's for a holy
[1:20:37] life I want you to listen how brother
[1:20:40] brandom
[1:20:41] identifies a holy life so it's not just
[1:20:43] long hair it's not just about not
[1:20:46] wearing makeup and it's not about your
[1:20:48] sister's not wearing pants and your
[1:20:50] brother's dressing a certain way and
[1:20:52] acting you know like that that's it's
[1:20:54] visible on the
[1:20:56] outside that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:58] for it's for a holy life that's right
[1:21:01] make you quit
[1:21:04] gossiping make you quit playing cards
[1:21:08] shooting crabs and all these other
[1:21:10] things that you do around the corner
[1:21:13] it'll make you quit carrying on the way
[1:21:15] you're doing living untrue to your wife
[1:21:18] that's what it'll do that's right it'll
[1:21:21] quit it make you want to marry somebody
[1:21:24] else's wife oh we've had a few of them
[1:21:26] in the message ain't we want to marry
[1:21:28] somebody else's wife that's right it's
[1:21:31] to make you live a holy
[1:21:34] life that's what the Holy Ghost is power
[1:21:40] for so it's to make you quit gossiping
[1:21:44] to help you to know so out of concern
[1:21:47] that we talk about this oh my and and
[1:21:51] brother Joe and I will talk brother Rob
[1:21:53] and I as the you leaders we'll talk and
[1:21:55] that brother Donnie would like to talk
[1:21:57] with you me and brother Rob has met and
[1:21:59] brother Joel and we've met and they just
[1:22:01] have something on their heart brother
[1:22:02] Donnie just want to ask you about this
[1:22:03] why do you think about that you know you
[1:22:05] know this what do you think well
[1:22:08] brothers let's pray about it let's just
[1:22:10] see it's not that we're running any of
[1:22:12] you all down it's not that they've come
[1:22:14] to me to to rad on you and tell on you
[1:22:17] for doing this it's out of concern I
[1:22:20] would not want men that would be our
[1:22:23] youth leaders if if they did not have a
[1:22:25] burden for your soul would you would you
[1:22:28] one them that would just let you do
[1:22:30] whatever and just keep all kinds of
[1:22:32] things hid and no no that's not the kind
[1:22:34] of men we want we want men who are
[1:22:37] burdened but one thing I admire about
[1:22:39] these brothers let me just give him a
[1:22:41] rose brother Robin here so his face
[1:22:43] won't turn red but I I appreciate both
[1:22:47] of these brothers because not only of
[1:22:50] having a desire to do something for you
[1:22:53] but to help light my load as well but
[1:22:56] both of them want to work within the
[1:22:59] confines of what they feel like their
[1:23:02] position is so brother Rob called me not
[1:23:05] long ago and he and I had a an extended
[1:23:08] conversation and he didn't want to
[1:23:10] overstep his position as far as being
[1:23:14] part of a youth leader he wanted just to
[1:23:16] be able to work you know where God put
[1:23:18] them well there's no scripture for a
[1:23:20] youth leader there's no scriptural
[1:23:23] qualifications
[1:23:25] there's no message qualifications for a
[1:23:27] youth leader search all you want to
[1:23:29] you're not going to find the word youth
[1:23:32] leader in the message so if there isn't
[1:23:35] any in the scripture and there isn't any
[1:23:36] in the message where are we going to get
[1:23:39] their
[1:23:40] guidelines anybody know the answer
[1:23:43] you'll get it from the
[1:23:46] head the head so what is the head of the
[1:23:49] church it ain't the Deacon board it
[1:23:51] ain't a trustee board who is the head
[1:23:53] it's a pastor so then the pastor will
[1:23:57] say look I I think that we need this we
[1:24:00] need that and then all right Brothers
[1:24:02] yall work with me and and you try to
[1:24:04] encourage and and you try to do that
[1:24:06] this is the example I shared with
[1:24:08] brother Rob I have a 2016 Buick Enclave
[1:24:13] check engine lot come on now I've I've
[1:24:15] done a little bit of mechanic work
[1:24:17] carolly I had a
[1:24:19] 1998 o mobile I loaned it to a preacher
[1:24:22] friend of mine and he never had driven
[1:24:24] an overdrive a car with overdrive so he
[1:24:28] just pulled it down in D was what he was
[1:24:30] used to driving D which I later said was
[1:24:33] for
[1:24:34] dumb needless to say so he pulls it down
[1:24:38] in D he drives it from Kentucky all the
[1:24:41] way to Delaware turns around drives it
[1:24:44] back a few days later in D and by the
[1:24:48] time he gets back it's smoking the
[1:24:51] transmission will not change gears and
[1:24:53] he leaves it in my drives away and says
[1:24:57] thanks so I take it to my uncle them
[1:25:00] which our mechanics and said what in the
[1:25:02] world said Donnie your motor and
[1:25:04] transmission both are burned
[1:25:06] up so I called this preacher hey message
[1:25:10] Preacher Man you burn up my motor and
[1:25:12] transmission ha haa fix
[1:25:16] it ah message preacher supposed to be
[1:25:19] full of the Holy
[1:25:20] Ghost so I go to looking for a motor
[1:25:23] transmission a contact brother Charlie
[1:25:25] Cox he found me one over in camville so
[1:25:28] I go over and pick it up I pull mine in
[1:25:30] my uncle's garage I pull the motor the
[1:25:33] transmission out set the other motor
[1:25:36] transmission anybody here ever pulled a
[1:25:37] motor or transmission out of a car okay
[1:25:40] it's it's quite a task is it B Jo it's
[1:25:42] quite a task to do walls boy of course
[1:25:45] runs in their family they can do it now
[1:25:48] there's no way I would try to do that
[1:25:52] now different year 2024 computer
[1:25:58] sensors but the Buick check engine light
[1:26:02] took it to O'Reilly's okay you got an
[1:26:04] oxygen sensor so it's a certain certain
[1:26:06] one I get on
[1:26:08] YouTube I look at it yep I can do this
[1:26:11] so I go out there I raise the hood I buy
[1:26:14] the oxygen sensor I do this this this I
[1:26:16] put it all back together fixed it check
[1:26:20] engine L comes on my 2016 truck
[1:26:24] oxygen sensor I thought I can handle
[1:26:27] this but I find out it's a certain
[1:26:31] oxygen sensor I realize right quick I'm
[1:26:35] out of my
[1:26:37] league so you know what I do take it to
[1:26:41] Ford so this is the example I tell
[1:26:44] brother Rob brother Rob God calls a man
[1:26:48] he gives you certain abilities and
[1:26:50] capacities so your work was in the
[1:26:52] confines of that capacity ity never feel
[1:26:56] like that you cannot admit this is
[1:26:59] beyond what I can do I need help you
[1:27:04] know the whole family of God would be so
[1:27:06] much better off if we all would work
[1:27:09] right brother Paul with that same
[1:27:11] mentality sometimes you go through
[1:27:13] things and you can handle it sometimes
[1:27:15] you go through other things and it's
[1:27:17] beyond you and you saying I handled the
[1:27:20] last time but maybe in this trial God
[1:27:23] wants you to fulfill the scripture by
[1:27:26] asking someone else to pray with you and
[1:27:29] by doing that they will fulfill the
[1:27:31] scripture that Paul wrote bear ye one
[1:27:34] another's burdens so it doesn't mean
[1:27:38] that you're not a great Christian it
[1:27:39] doesn't mean that you're beyond oh I'm
[1:27:41] getting weaker and weaker no maybe God
[1:27:43] wants you to reach out to somebody else
[1:27:46] and let them help you because three
[1:27:49] months down the road they're going to be
[1:27:51] reaching out to you for your help
[1:27:55] don't you love him tonight with all your
[1:27:56] heart let's bow our heads brother Jesse
[1:27:59] you musician Brothers thank you all I
[1:28:02] don't know if y'all are enjoying these
[1:28:04] or much I tell you what I I'm so
[1:28:05] enjoying these these questions I've
[1:28:07] enjoyed studying them I'm hearing from
[1:28:10] all over the world I have heard from old
[1:28:14] people and some real old people I've
[1:28:17] heard from young people as a matter of
[1:28:19] fact I heard from an older person not
[1:28:21] long ago and this was their uh view
[1:28:25] about the questions they said brother
[1:28:27] Donnie I
[1:28:28] hope that questions don't stop till the
[1:28:32] Rapture I said well I'm afraid they'll
[1:28:34] have to because they're wearing me out
[1:28:35] trying to study on them but I have so
[1:28:39] enjoyed them I hope that've been a
[1:28:41] blessing to you can we stand
[1:28:46] together Heavenly Father we count
[1:28:49] it a great honor and a privilege to
[1:28:52] speak to your people
[1:28:54] Lord Jesus as I look across these young
[1:28:58] people tonight and I think of Carol and
[1:29:01] I whenever we were going to church and
[1:29:05] we never had question answers we never
[1:29:07] had a youth
[1:29:08] meeting the whole time that we went to
[1:29:10] our
[1:29:11] church as a matter of fact they've heard
[1:29:13] me say it before the
[1:29:15] first youth meeting I ever attended I
[1:29:18] preached it what we would have
[1:29:21] given for the ministry of the church to
[1:29:24] have focused on us and to let us meet I
[1:29:28] had so many
[1:29:30] questions so many
[1:29:32] questions what I would have given to be
[1:29:35] able to had answers a lot of the things
[1:29:37] I've learned I've learned by Fault by
[1:29:40] mistake by
[1:29:43] failure it shows what a love that you
[1:29:46] have for the young people of this
[1:29:49] age that you would lay it on their
[1:29:52] hearts
[1:29:54] dear God of the ministry I'd never even
[1:29:57] heard a preacher do question and
[1:30:00] answers until I come to the message and
[1:30:03] whenever I did it seemed
[1:30:06] odd it seemed really strange to me that
[1:30:09] a preacher would have people to write
[1:30:12] down the questions and this is the way
[1:30:14] brother Brenham did it that he would
[1:30:15] have the people to turn it in and he
[1:30:17] said I I want to look at them and I
[1:30:20] could take many of these questions off
[1:30:21] the cuff but they wouldn't have near as
[1:30:24] many scriptures they wouldn't have near
[1:30:26] as many quotes they wouldn't have near
[1:30:28] the history background it takes a lot of
[1:30:32] time to put it all together and I want
[1:30:35] them to be so so covered by the answer
[1:30:41] so it'll help them in life dear Jesus
[1:30:44] how we thank you for this time together
[1:30:48] I pray that you'd bless us father we
[1:30:50] love you so much we look forward to
[1:30:53] Gathering here again Sunday and we're
[1:30:56] just asking that you'd visit us in a
[1:30:58] special way we pray for those from our
[1:31:00] church that's on vacation I know it's
[1:31:02] summertime and Lord some Canada some
[1:31:06] here there there we pray that you'd
[1:31:08] watch over them some flew out today for
[1:31:10] Arizona uh just different places that
[1:31:13] people are on vacation and we pray that
[1:31:15] you'd be with them Lord and give them a
[1:31:17] good time a restful time with their
[1:31:19] family we love you so much bless our
[1:31:22] youth of leaders father bless our youth
[1:31:24] groups make them Father to be the youth
[1:31:27] that you want them to be father we don't
[1:31:30] just want them to be the Church of
[1:31:32] tomorrow but we want them to be the
[1:31:34] Church of today that's why Lord I want
[1:31:38] to take special services for them and we
[1:31:42] are so grateful I just can't say it
[1:31:46] enough Lord I've been over here a lot
[1:31:49] since we've been in the church since
[1:31:50] February weeding and putting out stones
[1:31:54] and doing this and that and the other
[1:31:57] Lord I I I was just here this this week
[1:32:01] and as I pulled in through the gate and
[1:32:04] I pulled in I just said it out loud to
[1:32:07] you lord I can't believe this is
[1:32:11] ours I can't
[1:32:13] believe I can't believe that this is our
[1:32:16] place I want to thank you I want to
[1:32:20] thank you I would have never thought we
[1:32:23] would have had such a place and it's
[1:32:26] evident it's not just for us how many
[1:32:29] other people have been blessed by youth
[1:32:31] services and special meetings we're
[1:32:34] thankful for it Lord Even in our youth
[1:32:37] services youth from Virginia and youth
[1:32:39] from North Carolina and youth from Ohio
[1:32:42] and different places I've heard from
[1:32:44] pastors I've heard from associate
[1:32:46] ministers that's let their youth group
[1:32:49] come and be in this meetings they've
[1:32:51] thanked me over and over again and and
[1:32:53] they say that their youths have been so
[1:32:56] blessed we are so grateful Lord thank
[1:32:59] you so much for letting us have this
[1:33:02] place we are grateful I pray that it'll
[1:33:05] never become common to us Lord Jesus I
[1:33:08] know if time
[1:33:10] terries either I'll go by the way of the
[1:33:12] Grave or I'll get so old that I can't
[1:33:15] preach no more but dear God if that so
[1:33:19] then I believe there's youth sitting
[1:33:20] here and they'll they'll be the song
[1:33:23] leaders and they'll be the elders in the
[1:33:25] church in that day so I've tried to make
[1:33:28] something Lord that if time goes on to
[1:33:32] where that the truth will stand and
[1:33:34] they'll have a place to be able to bring
[1:33:36] them Lord may it stand as a testimony
[1:33:39] for your great power father we pray in

[1:37:56] that as many questions as y'all have
[1:37:59] turned
[1:38:00] in it's your your desire to be
[1:38:03] right when you send in a question that's
[1:38:06] that's what I'm starting to learn about
[1:38:08] you is that we have a group of young
[1:38:10] people that want to be right and brings
[1:38:13] the questions you know and some of the
[1:38:16] questions that you might he that brother
[1:38:18] Donnie goes over and you listen to those
[1:38:21] questions you think I have no problem
[1:38:22] with that that's something simple I
[1:38:24] don't understand but if you understand
[1:38:28] when you listen to the detail of what
[1:38:30] brother Donnie brings it out how much
[1:38:32] time and study and prayer that he puts
[1:38:35] into one simple
[1:38:36] question because he wants you to be
[1:38:39] right
[1:38:39] too and he wants the leadership of the
[1:38:42] Lord and I I appreciate that and I was I
[1:38:45] saw a video the other day I told Brother
[1:38:47] Rob I saw a video the other day and the
[1:38:49] video was shows these sheep going on a
[1:38:52] road just a big long line of sheep and
[1:38:55] there's one dog behind
[1:38:57] them and that dog is Behind These sheep
[1:39:00] and these sheep some of these sheep
[1:39:01] would get off to the side of the road
[1:39:03] they wouldn't get off the road but they
[1:39:06] would get on the side of the road and as
[1:39:07] soon as they got on the side of the road
[1:39:10] that dog would run up there and heard
[1:39:12] them dogs back them sheep back to the
[1:39:14] middle and the title of that was
[1:39:17] Pastor that's all it said it just said
[1:39:21] pastor this pastor wasn't hurting sheep
[1:39:25] that fell by the
[1:39:27] wayside it was hurting sheep that was
[1:39:29] still on the road that we're getting to
[1:39:32] the edge of the road cuz that's where we
[1:39:34] want to be we want to be in the middle
[1:39:36] and and the fact you know we's talking
[1:39:38] about you know gossiping and talking to
[1:39:41] one another and
[1:39:43] stuff good sheep will help a pastor out
[1:39:46] when Trouble Comes when things them
[1:39:48] sheep will Bunch together they'll get
[1:39:51] together and they'll pull together
[1:39:53] there's nothing better than having a
[1:39:55] group of Holy Ghost filled friends that
[1:39:57] you can take your burdens to and have
[1:40:00] them pray and and not worry they're
[1:40:02] going to go tell somebody else you know
[1:40:05] be the friend that talks to
[1:40:07] God like the four friends like we we
[1:40:10] said a couple weeks ago have four
[1:40:11] friends that do anything they can to get
[1:40:13] you to Jesus so I appreciate that
