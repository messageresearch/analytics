faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen that's crazy to the world isn't it the evidence of things hoped for the evidence you mean faith has an evidence faith is the evidence of things hoped for it's a substance it's just as real to you more real than this or this or this or this or symptoms it's an evidence now we're talking about bride material we thank god for positive test results we thank god for days when we feel better but real face says i'm healed whether i feel bad or not amen real faith says it well the doctor said bad news doesn't make any difference brother ben said the doctor could say you ain't got but a few minutes to live if it was dropped in your heart you could life in his face why you've got isaac and isaac is laughter amen don't you love him today don't you appreciate his grace and mercy to our hearts let's turn if you would to the book of romans chapter eight we're turning there and wanted to announce another wedding engagement of justin lovell and sister shalom swanson we're happy as long as he's moving this way we're not so happy if she's having to go there that's the downside of having all these girls in our church these guys from phoenix and from tucson and from louisiana they come here courtney and then take our saints away we're happy for him aren't we listen amen praise the lord romans chapter 8 verse 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god wow so if we take that literally as the english phrases it there is not a person in this building or one in the world can ever please god if we take it literally for what it says but now let's read a little further so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh wow somebody hit me with a wet noodle you've got to be kidding i'm not in the flesh and you all aren't in the flesh what in the world's causing us all these problems but listen but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now remember this is chapter 8 of course after chapter 7. chapter 8 does not cancel out seven it actually brings six and seven together in the merging of chapter eight now listen to this now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now this used to be one of my favorite scriptures when i was a pentecostal preacher but once i really realized what this scripture actually meant i used to use it all the time maybe many of you all heard it the same way that it was for shouting and dancing and you know highly emotional services that the spirit in you will quicken your mortal body but when you look at what paul's saying he ain't talking about shouting at all he's talking about our bodies being brought subject to the life that lives within us so it actually quickens our body to obedience aren't you grateful for that today i may like to be remembered today before the lord in prayer i have two requests i'd like to make known to you today the bible tells us to make our requests known and i'd like for you to be praying for my oldest daughter liz she's been sick for for several days um just not feeling well at all just ask that you remember her erica will begin her fourth treatment tomorrow monday tuesday and wednesday we got some really good reports from the doctor the words the doctor kept using over and over again was great she was doing great doing great so we're thankful we shouldn't really be surprised we have a great god he's a great mighty god praise the lord also brother louie has already mentioned all the other needs among among the body our assembly here and the philippines was hit with a terrible terrible typhoon and we have thousands and thousands of believers there on the islands of the philippines i haven't really heard any initial reports yet as far as lives damage churches things like that but we'd certainly like to remember them as well i'm sure that most of you understand that we are in a terrible time politically in the sense of the world facing an election this week and i know probably every one of you has got your own party and you've got your own man and i ain't interested in neither one of them one of them's i'm just a narcissist is all he can be and the other is a political crook and a liar so we ain't got no nobody choose from you you could vote for a groundhog and get a better option than either one of them so don't don't get either one of them get mad at me because we ain't got nobody's runs worth account but the way i read according to the bible the scripture said the powers that be are ordained of god and you're probably like me you want prophecy to come to pass i want the end time to come upon us and i want to get out of here but i want it to be as easy and as gently as possible [Music] i'm only being honest so i'm not telling you not to vote i'm going to tell you not to vote who to vote for and who not to vote for but there's one thing i'm going to tell you this morning we better pray because the lord knows who we need in the white house who do you sing what i'm saying don't really matter what you think to be honest don't really matter but the lord knows so let's take these requests to the lord today heavenly father as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth from once these bodies were taken we bring many needs and requests before you today but we're instructed to ask for great things and for many of them we know lord that you're not rationing your power your greatness is so been expressed to our hearts and our lives and we're so thankful in one way we hate to constantly come before you with this need and that need and another need but i remember reading of your children as they come out of the land of egypt and how there was two and a half million of them or so there was no walmarts no krogers there was no dollar general store so they could run over and get a pair of shoes if they needed some water if they needed something to eat they had no grocery trains that was following them there was no supply lines but you love them so much father you sent them water you sent them meat you sent them bread from heaven their shoes their clothes they didn't have no malls to be able to buy clothes but their shoes never wore out nor their clothes so we believe you're just as concerned about our needs today father you see our nation where we are facing an election week and probably for most of us this is no doubt the most important election in our life lord god i'm neither democrat nor republican i'm a christian i've never voted in my life and i have no plan on starting it now but there's one thing i can do i can pray and lord jesus you see the way we need to go whichever man we need in the white house whichever party we need to control the white house the senate and the congress we pray your divine will will be done that's one thing we all as christians can agree on you know better than we do so we pray father that you bring to pass your divine order those that are sick those that are afflicted may you be mindful of us lord as we endeavor to look into your word and break the bread of life i pray that you should help me to get out of the way father in the name of the lord jesus we ask him and the saints said amen amen god bless you you may be seated really the only way you and i could ever come back to god and be reconciled in his presence is because our god had to canoes himself away from the shekinah away from the fullness of what he was in the form of the word had he left us here in this earth as mortals to defend ourselves to try to find our way somehow back to god every one of us here today would be lost no hope for us paul says here in romans 8 10 and if christ being you the body is dead now the english here doesn't actually give the true perspective of the greek words that paul used actually the words that he uses references that the body is not actually physically dead but subject to death because of sin i hope you can understand it today that before sin there was no mortality there were no mortal leaves the garden of eden never had a fall the garden of eden never had winter it never had snow it never had rain it never had a frost the trees were constantly being renewed and when adam and eve had pulled the fruit off of the trees it was constantly being replenished there was no mortality there were no dead animals no dead birds you would never walk by a tree as we can see and as the wind blows even this morning i looked at my window at home and saw the leaves that were falling by the hundreds well what does that speak up it speaks of a mortality that not only struck us but that struck all of nature now whether it would be dogs cats elephants oils whatever more there are no animals there are no bugs no microbes no micro isms nothing that can live eternally under the curse of what took place in the garden of eden and yet god did not ordain mortality to be our destiny only a spot that we would be in it in this sequence of time we were not made to be mortal that's why when we reach a certain age and wrinkles start coming in our face and our hair turns gray or loose whichever it is what is it a sign of mortality so when you get up of a morning and you've got aches and pains you weren't meant to have that actually the body renews itself every seven years you were meant to be able to eat foods that would provide the nutrients and the nourishments that you would need where you would never die and you would have lived and ate and drank and continually lived forever was ever out aging one hour so you would have never got old you would have never got crippled you would have never lost your sight or your hearing but sin brought mortality then death entered into the world by sin so there's only one way sin can be taken out of the world and that again is by death but it's not by the deaths of an animal it's not by the deaths of botany life not by the deaths of even good people but it must be by the deaths of him who gave life now we can get ourselves in trouble but most of time we can't get ourselves out we can sin without any help but we can't be made righteous without help we can make the office messes in the world without any help then when we get help we're really in a mess well come on it's the truth that's why when you put people in a gang mentality that's why things go absolutely crazy because you within yourself me within myself can make up enough mess and then you get a bunch of us together and boy we can really tear things up but there had to be something someone that would come that was not mortal yet he had to become mortal in order to pay the penalty and the price of mortality you see that price could not remain in the realm of eternity and ever cover the debt that we owed so the eternal had to become mortal himself the eternal had to become mortal and how could the eternal ever become mortal when god could never die so then we come to the mystery or the marvel of what is called the son of god not another person in the godhead not another being which was less god but god himself in a form of condescension that he would condescend to a level that he would be able to feel and deal with mortality so if sin entered into the human race and by that the end result was death and it set the cycle of mortality what a sad day it must have been when adam and eve were forced out of the garden of eden and when they moved beyond the gates of paradise and they had to turn and we we know that they stayed right near the gate initially because paradise then the garden of eden being located in the land of egypt and mesopotamia being called the cradle of civilization and when they were cast out there was still something in adam's nature that he wanted to be close to god they taught their voice and they actually did not teach them the right way you remember the sermon the lord gave me years ago on my father taught me wrong they did not teach them the full understanding that they were brought out by disobedience by blood so when cain goes to bring an offering to god he brings his fruits his labors his vegetables but abel by revelation brought life and by that it showed that he had a direct contact into the presence of god so the first mortal outside of the gates of paradise god reveals to him the way back and yet he was not there when his mother and father were called to the carpet as we would say and god went running through the garden of eden screaming adam where are you where are you finally adam called out from behind the bushes his flesh trembling and the first time in his life he feels fear trauma must have run over his entire body as his flesh quivered and trembled he'd never experienced it before that's hard for us to imagine it's all we've known as mortals but yet for them to experience in their first time the trauma of fear and hearing the voice of god which the day before and the day before and the day before and the day before have brought them such happiness and such peace but today the voice of god brings trauma and fear and anxiety adam where are you i'm over here i heard your voice walking in the garden and i was afraid because i am naked now the man had made a fig leaf apron but that apron did not hide his sin [Music] is that right he knew he was naked so he needed help with his atonement and god by his mercy killed a lamb and threw the skin in behind the bushes where adam and eve were and told them to put it on god is not going to reverse now their mortality god is not going to reverse this conscience level that they've moved into they lived in this first dispensation in the garden of eden was innocence but by partaking of the fruit disobeying the word adam himself and eve brought a dispensational change they then move into the dispensation of conscience so now they begin to experience what is right and wrong the feelings of conviction condemnation the knowing that you never ever again will you ever be able to have a perfect day on earth for us that's all we've ever known as you know i've been preaching since i was a little boy just 18 years old i'm 64. been preaching most of my life preached thousands of sermons around the world and i've never preached a perfect one i've made mistakes in every one of them we've got musicians here that are very talented brothers and sisters they've never played a perfect song in their life we've got many singers that are talented songwriters and so on they've never sung a perfect song you christians many of you been living god for decades giving your life to him you've never had a perfect day when you could say today was absolutely perfect you've never had one you'd stand and would have you all to stand and give a testimony today of the greatness of god in your life none of you would give a perfect testimony you would probably think why did i say that i wish i would have said that i wish i'd have left that out and said this you see we don't know perfection in reality we cannot even understand it we use the word and we use it so loosely well this was a perfect day the sun was so beautiful and the temperature was just right and there was no wind uh there was no clouds in the sky but it wasn't a perfect day thousands die every hour so no matter what we look at there's nothing in this life that is actually able to reach the goal of perfection and there was only one who had perfection was in himself but how do you get that perfection broke down into the realm of mortals who were never meant to be this way anyway if you come in the state of perfection itself and you remain in that state you cannot divide yourself and share that with these mortals that use so hunger to have them in your presence you see the desire that we have is only half of this story you want to see him not near as bad as he wants to see you you long to go to heaven do you not you long for the rapture we long to see our loved ones we long for the great gathering together we don't long for it near as much as he does he longed for it before there was ever a molecule before there's ever one cosmic ray of light he longed to have you there in his presence and yet he allowed mortality to move into the cycle as we spoke about it before the little loop of time that come right down to the cycle in order to express the greatness of his attributes now when paul is writing here in romans chapter 8 by this stage and the journey of course the apostolic time it was meant in succession and it was going on the book of romans written around 64 a.d something like that so christianity had been around for about 30 years as far as what god was doing in the church and there were people from rome which are very vile people had a very bad background the crinton people were were a mixture of greeks and romans and corinthians corinth was a port city a very wicked wicked place and yet god through all of this had established churches now in different continents and different nations and god was pulling the people together and there needed to be a gospel message that was beyond matthew mark luke and john we thank god for the four gospels but i thank god that's not the end of it we would not know a lot of how to conduct ourself in life and in the church and in our behavior in the world if we only have the gospels is that right and yet god chose one man for the most part which was paul that was going to be anointed the first church age messenger to be able to bring most of how we were to live how we were to behave the doctrines of the church dress and so on and so on why because matthew mark luke and john was not called to write much of those things the lord jesus could have said those things when he was here but he chose not to it was a dispensation that would be administered to by himself through the gifts in his body called preachers is that right now then if the spirit of god lives inside of us this is one of the true signs that we have the holy ghost that the spirit of god will bring our bodies subject to the word now this happens of course because the lord jesus desired to express himself and the sense is that the gospel by the influence of the spirit of god will bring the entire man in subjection to the word so the indwelling of the holy ghost actually places our soul further back than adam and eve was in the garden of eden now i know it may seem odd to you to say that but yet when you look at it i don't know i've never found actually what adam actually had in the garden of eden i know he had an express image and it was something that god had given to him that was eternal breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living soul which bore the image of the invisible god but yet whatever it was that he received he could lose by disobedience right and this is why we are where we are today but the lord jesus and the new testament perform such a work that those that would actually get in christ jesus and be hid away in him they would be sealed further back than adam and eve ever was in the garden of eden now for those of you today who had the true baptism of the holy ghost adam fell he fell you know on and on and on the story goes but if you are sealed by the holy ghost the bible tells us that you've got these virtues of the lord god inside of you you will never fall so that shows us the greatness of the work that transpired at calvary was even greater than the original creation in the garden of eden now we're certainly long do we not we long for paradise to be restored but in reality paradise is already in the phase of restoration because those who have the true baptism of the holy ghost they have already entered into that secret place in christ jesus and their soul is sealed in the presence of god and then when the body dies the soul goes into the theophany and the presence of god then the resurrection they both come back to meet the redeemed body now this is not the end for the body itself there is a future for the body thank god but notice this in romans chapter 8 verse 12 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh now here is a man that you all believe with me i'm sure had the true baptism of the holy ghost how many believes that and yet paul is still writing in chapter 6 of romans chapter 7 of romans chapter 8 of romans and he's still writing about apparently a battle that is going on between the regenerated part the soul and the part which is not regenerated which is the flesh notice how that he approaches this therefore brethren we are deaders not to the flesh look at this meaning of this word one who owes another one held by some obligation bound by some duty one who has not yet made amends to whom he has injured so in other words paul is saying to us that are redeemed in the soul that we are not in debt to our flesh to obey our fleshly desires if they are contrary to the word of god right but who are we in debt to the almighty god every day of your life now notice therefore brethren we are not deaderst not to the flesh to live out to the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die now here he's bringing in the consequence of how that being born again this is why it goes back to the other verses that we read that he said that if we are in the flesh we cannot even please god so he's not saying that a soul left an immortal body cannot please god but a soul left in a mortal body that tries to please the soul and tries to please the flesh it's totally impossible you've got to make your choice of which one you're going to serve that's right for if you live out to the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live mortify not then to live out to the flesh is to obey the orders of the flesh which is still unregenerate now remember your body is in a state of spiritual neutrality how that your body can do right or wrong now praise the lord everybody's going to say amen right brother louis said make your mask puff now i don't want snoring ones i don't want them sucked over your face i want you saying amen breathing out not breathing in now to live out to the flesh then is to obey the flesh and to know that our flesh it has the ability of sin praise the lord i love you jesus or if you lose your temper and boy can say things and run off at the mouth amen or you can say things about one another that you shouldn't say well who's doing that your soul or your body amen is that right now notice again then paul said that if the spirit of god is in us then we have the ability to mortify the deeds of the body what a peculiar word so sin is mortified in its power whenever the holy ghost from the soul captures it and brings it into captivity so then it actually ceases to be active as it was now i know this may seem odd to you but mortification is not something that happens one time now listen to me so that you don't misunderstand where i'm going i'm not saying by any means at all that a person who is born again does not have any control over their body if you have no control over your body you are not born again but your body is not born again but the new birth wants to bring the body into a state of continual ongoing mortification now whenever the lord strikes our nature the old nature and the all nature actually dies and we are born again that is not something that is gradual that is not something that is day by day by day and then gradually you grow into more of the holy ghost and more of the holy ghost and then one day you realize you got the holy ghost somehow you don't know when you got it but you growed into it no the holy ghost is an experience is that right it's not an ongoing something that takes you 45 years to get it you can get it right here today if you don't have it in a moment and a twinkling of an hour is that right but notice then whenever we move mortification then to the body it is not something that happens instantaneously as the new birth does now this is what seems to be so confusing to so many folks because they read quotes like this or scriptures like this and they will say well my goodness i've got the holy ghost and i believe i'm born again how come my flesh still bothers them and how come this still bothers me and then others will say bless god if you ever get to holy ghost you'll never look at a woman i'll tell you one thing you'll never get aggravated you'll never get upset they're lying to you [Applause] well praise the lord but mortification must be a continual necessarily painful procedure that goes on in the life of every child of god now there's no way that we can mortify our bodies without it causing pain now think of it there's no way an animal or a mortal can be able to leave out of this life all you people say well boy i've been able to go to sleep on you know and go lay down and sleep at night and then you die in your sleep that would be ideal but you might not have known it but somehow you're experiencing some type of pain you're having a heart attack you're having whatever more so death does not come and strike a mortal without an element of pain now when we bring that then to the continual sacrificial life of a child of god it's going to bring pain because the mortification on our body cannot be pain free now i know we don't like that we want it to be pain free and we'd like to have all kinds of spiritual shots and all kinds of spiritual pills and you know where we can be able to leave this life as a pain-free mortal it ain't going to happen now i guarantee you one thing any of you that's ever experienced a lot of pain how many y'all's experienced pain before whether by cut or pull muscle in your back or a kidney stone or whatever it is oh my goodness whenever they give you a shot the last big kidney stone i have and i went to franklin woods and took them in there and i was trying to sit on the bed i couldn't sit on the bed i was standing up i was moving i was twisting around they gave me morphine and tore it all at the same time both of them at the same time i was tearing the sheets off the bed i was up i was moving i was trying to stand still but in a few minutes a warm thing hit me in the back of my neck which they said it would and whenever that warm feeling hit me in the back of my neck all of a sudden i felt a relief come over my body i wanted to buy a 55 gallon drum of that stuff just in case it ever hit me again now those of you that ain't had kidneys don't you're sitting or the big frown on your face if you've ever had one or your husband or your dad's had one you can smile because you know what i'm talking about so there's something about pain that we don't like i don't like pain myself i don't like pain i've had a lot of in my life as most of us mortals have and it's worse in the sense when it comes to the body on a continual diet you see those that are christ have crucified the flesh that's what paul says in the book of galatians they that are christ which is possessive they have crucified the flesh but it's not just something that happened one time and that's the end it is an ongoing continual crucifixion this is what god is requiring for us all praise the lord and this is what made it possible was the kenosis or the emptying out of our lord jesus in order to have a church that he would call his bride now this is what separates one of the many things that separates the bride from the church because the church natural they don't want to go to hell they don't want to be lost they don't want you know any those sort of thing but they don't want to live a continual life on the cross now living a life on the cross is not an easy life living alive on the cross and the lord jesus spoke more about your cross and my cross than he did about his own cross as a matter of fact he spoke about your cross before he spoke about his own if any man will follow me let him take up his cross and follow me once at least once a week at least once a month no let him follow me daily now the more painful and you know that's so sad but with human beings what i've found so many times in the lives of many people is the longer they prolong this thing about giving up everything to god the more painful the deaths will actually be there are some that are able by the grace of god they realize they're wrong and they realize mortification is the only way to be able to deal with this body and they're able to come to that recognition pretty soon in life and they're able by the spirit of god to be able to give over the body to mortification not saying that it doesn't arise every now and then and bother them and try to affect them but it no longer controls them it is not their master it is not their master but they control it and there's others and they give a little bit to god and then they go on and they give a little bit more to god and they spread it over five years and then 10 years and 15 years and 20 years and they're only prolonging the inevitable you see to be the bride this is inevitable for every one of us whether you're a prophet whether you're a pastor or a sunday school teacher no matter who you are every one of us must mortify the deeds of our body what am i speaking about i'm speaking about isaac bringing ishmael under control because isaac is the promised son and his smell is the troubled one whoa boy that was good right there and then my my isaac is the promised son and ishmael is the troubled one then what's going to happen why don't we just take a knife and slit this ishmael's throat that's not the way god wants it done it wants it through the power of sanctification which runs in on mortality and then it produces what to the body it mortifies the deeds of the body oh my my thank you all for saying amen so much as more now notice this cannot be done by ourselves but it will never be done without ourselves let me say it again this cannot be done by ourselves but it will not be done without ourselves i want you to notice how paul is separating this from the new birth so he did not say that god mortified the deeds of your body but you are to mortify so from there it lets us know we're speaking to people that are born again in romans chapter 8 still following chapter 7. so he's speaking to those who have the indwelling presence of christ living inside of them but he is telling them for them to mortify the deeds of their body well why don't the holy ghost do it why don't he just do everything we'd be more lazy than what we are so notice it cannot be done by ourselves but it will not be done without ourselves oh hallelujah we can sin of ourselves but we can't make ourselves righteous is that right we know how to be slaves but we cannot free ourselves notice in romans chapter 8 verse 13 for if you live out to the flesh you shall die but if ye notice now the channel watch him as he brings it together now of you from the soul and you by that choice if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body who's he talking about he's separating you from you so if you by the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body so he's not even calling you the body he's separating you from your body don't you understand glory to god he's speaking about the work of incarnation but people think the work of incarnation was jesus though the lord of jesus only no that was the beginning that was the beginning of a continual do you understand for seven church ages for 2 000 years god has been the work of incarnation and every holy ghost feels saying the work of incarnation is going on right here today in this building the spirit of god incarnating himself in our flesh [Applause] lord jesus but if you through the spirit if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live ye who you see the fallen nature that every one of us still have in the flesh not the soul in the flesh the propensities to do wrong the incarnations so y'all believe that brother branham had the cross on his mirror in the car for decoration right [Music] really you know you mean you believe that was there for to to help him some way he was immortal praise the lord so it's to kill to kill the appetites that are in our mortality and your paul about dividing this is showing the work of incarnation this could not be said to people that are not born again is impossible their soul their spirit their body is all vile and corrupt this could only be addressed to those who have the holy ghost so if ye have the spirit what are you to do with it not just signs wonders and miracles but mortify the deeds of your body notice this i love this in romans 8 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god this is a mark of a son and daughter of god they're led not driven [Music] now watch a person in a justified and sanctified state they will have to be driven to do many things why because their nature still in their soul has not been born again and they've got to be drove to the don't do this and don't do that and don't do this and don't do that but if they ever get the holy ghost those driving days are over why because from their soul now notice i'm not talking about people who say well i feel led to do this and i feel led to do that look come on let's be honest we've all felt led to do a lot of things when we found out it was either the devil or our flesh it wasn't a bit more god than the man on the moon and yet well i feel led to do this i'm talking about that i'm talking about notice he's not just talking about feeling led to move here or feeling led by this car feeling led to go to work over here he's talking about us being led by the spirit of god every day of our life bringing our humanity under a state of mortification this is what leads us to do it the indwelling presence of god you don't need a pastor going around with you everywhere you go to keep you right if you got the holy ghost the holy ghost will keep you right oh my well your wives don't need to follow your husbands around everywhere and vice versa to make sure they live right and they're gonna do right if they've got the holy ghost the holy ghost and we'll help them do right come on saints say amen thus manias are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god you see as a traveler would be led by his guide as a traveler would be led by his god or a student would be led by his or her teacher so the spirit of god wants to lead us as he teaches us in the realm of mortification oh hallelujah notice in colossians 3 4 when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory amen the dead bodies of the saints will be raised up i love the way the prophet says it this way and melchizedek we meet jesus in the air before we get home that's right second thessalonians tells us that we meet him in the our beautiful type of rebecca meeting isaac in the field in the cool of the day we meet him in the air second thessalonians tells us so for we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound the dead and christ shall rise first we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with them to meet the lord in the air perfect all these types therefore the theophany if you have died and entered into that theophany what happens the theophany comes to the earth to pick up the redeemed body and if you're here in the air i don't know about you i'm going to have to be changed to be able to be suspended in the middle of the air waiting for my theophany oh my if you are here in the air my my you take the body you take the body you take the body who is you the seed of god the gene of god that one which has amen receive the true baptism of the holy ghost you it is you why because you're the one who mortified it it would be you who leads it to match the theophany don't you understand friends even in the rapture god is allowing you to bring your body into the final phase of mortality you will take your body you will not jesus not paul taken yours not brother branham taking your not peter taking yours but you brother larry you my brothers and sisters you will take your own body to meet your theophany if you're here in the air you take the body to meet the theophany there you are and caught up and go meet the lord in the air who is this melchizedek but god colossians 3 5 paul says mortify therefore your members again not the holy ghost but me and you mortify let's look at the meaning of this word the greek word is necro to make dead to put to death slay worn out deprive of power destroy the strengths of and the holy ghost ain't going to do this not by himself with the holy ghost using you he will do it now we're talking about bride material i just gave just gave you the definition of every member around the world of the bride of christ that'll go in the rapture you see whether the black white red or yellow where they go to this church that church that won't have one thing to do with it it will have to do with this right here those who brought their bodies under mortification will change their body to the final consummation of a body change notice mortified therefore your members which are upon the earth oh my goodness what in the world is he doing listing these horrible things fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence covetousness which is idolatry you mean our bodies our bodies brother nathan could do them awful things now all of you angels that are here this morning it's pretty warm in this building so i'd appreciate a little bit of air if y'all want to flutter your wings a little bit because it's getting awful warm in here i think so all you church members just flutter your wings and cool it down i wonder how many of you have lied this week [Music] i wonder how many your brothers have looked at women in a way you shouldn't have don't raise no hands i don't want no divorces going on today i wonder how many of you got on facebook and flying oh my just flapped your jaws about this and that and the other i wonder how many of you have been busy bodies and other people's matters that really don't affect you at all preach brother bernie so why do we deal with these things because of our mortality and there's only one way a mortal can keep be kept subject mortified mortified mortify our eyes our ears our hands our feet praise god wow i found this scripture yesterday and i'll tell you what it was just overwhelming to me first corinthians 9 27 but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway now you know in reading paul's writings that paul used a lot of the greek games running the race and the different synonyms that he would use because he could see a parallel of the games and how that it was a struggle and that'd only be one in a certain class that would get the the wreath that was planted but here paul says a strange word and it was like those who boxed and wrestled in the olympic games look at the word keep to beat black and blue oh but now most of us deal with our flesh with rose petals when you should be doing this ah even you legalists didn't say i'm in for it aren't i i can you imagine a man filled with the holy ghost a church aged messenger and a prophet that would liken dealing with his humanity as a man boxing himself so he's not standing up you know boxing with an opponent but he's actually hitting himself wham well that was a government ram that was a government i knocked the breath out of myself i died good didn't i'm well we'd say there's something mentally wrong with a person like that the way we look at it there's something mentally wrong with the person if they're not doing that to beat myself black and blue you see friends to be honest with you and make my my job as a pastor a whole lot easier if you all would do this to yourself instead of making me do it y'all come in here and sit down and you all ain't gotten a bit more bruises in this piece of paper right here you look like a sack of white lily flower you're just so prim and proper and you're just as white now i get up here brother dale gets up here some of these other preachers get up here and go to dragging out that sword and we cut your ear off we flay your nose we've removed two or three of your fingers that's just an opening comments and then you walk out where you been church well it must have been bad i got out easy you ought to see the rest of them notice what paul said to be black and blue to smite so as to cause bruises and livid spots like a boxer one buffets his body handled it roughly disciplined by hardships metaphorically to give one intolerance intolerable annoyance beat one out wear one out buying treaties now if you could do this to yourself the way you do it to folks on facebook we'd have a church on me now wait a minute if paul is converted and got the holy ghost and now remember this is not chapter seven he's talking about how he has to still treat his life as a mortal brother jim i've got to beat it black and blue why if it's saved and got the holy ghost why is it if there's no faults left in this human it shows me that the paul that he's addressing is like the donny i'm addressing like the harry like the lance lot the carol the barber the janet the whoever more come on now saints go ahead and say amen but i i notice i not the holy ghost not the church not the deacons but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection look at the word bring to lead away to slavery claim as one slave praise god forget human perfection focus on human captivity and you bring your body as a slave to the spirit of god to make a slave and to treat as a slave with severity subject to stern and rigid discipline you can see why straight is the gate that leads to heaven and few there be that will find it but broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be that go in there at why they cannot stand personal discipline personal your friend you understand that a real son of god a real daughter of god they don't behave righteous and good just in the presence of their wife or their husband or the pastor or a deacon they behave the same whether the wife's around the deacon's around the pastors around why because they have something inside of them that mortifies their body when they're by their self they don't flip a switch to sanctification stage from the wife sitting next to him or when the husband is sitting next to him but they've got a hallelujah a power on the inside that helps them to live a sanctified life if there ain't nobody within a thousand miles they're holy they're righteous they're true they're pure they're born again and they mortify by that new birth the deeds of their body so paul in capturing this thought uses the athlete and the associate must be disciplined to win the prize he must watch what he eats he must watch how many hours he stays up at night even though other people may come around oh man look at this boston cream pie look at this upside down pineapple cake man look at all these high carbs it's that another oh don't you want it why of course he wants it but he wants to prize more because he knows too many carbs and this and that and the other can work on his performance you're preaching with me oh you'd be lying to say i don't want that at all sure he wants it he wants it just as bad or maybe more so than you do because you had it yesterday he ain't had it in a month why because he disciplines himself you think he likes him when he has to get out there and run in the white rain and run in the snow and running the whim whenever you're piled up in the bed at a quarter after five of course he don't but he wants what he wants the price you think our mortality wants all of these things of course it does not but we want the prize i don't want to just come to the gates and say i barely made it i want to please my lord my prize my brother sister is hearing my lord jesus say well done thou good and faithful servant well done i'll give up the world i'll give up the things of the world i will discipline myself to get the prize you see discipline does not necessarily mean just giving up the bad discipline means giving up the good the better for the best it don't just mean giving up the horrible and the terrible it means giving up the good the better for the best hallelujah the athlete must watch what he eats must watch his time his mind his concentration that's why you need to watch what you feed on spiritually i talk about your hamburgers and you taters and your maters and all that sort of thing i'm talking about what you feed on now look here paul said i disciplined myself in this way lest while i preached to others i would be a castaway you see paul believed in eternal security he's not saying that he thought he'd be lost again he's using the same term in the games that he would lose the prize and get no reward so there was a herald let me bring you this way this is history a herald who announced the rules of the contest the names of the contestants and the names and cities of the winners he would also announce the names of any contestants who were qualified so paul saw himself as a herald but he also saw himself as a contestant he saw himself as announcing the evil he saw himself as announcing the good and he also announced those who are going to win and those who are going to lose but he said after i've done all that i don't want to come up myself and actually the word there was be disqualified right don't we hear it about in american sports and other sports where they take enhancing drugs to do this and that and the other in horse races so the horse that wins they want to take him back to the stable and let them draw blood and make sure they didn't give him some type of enhancing drug oh my paul said i don't want to go over this and labor i don't want to be tossed out at night and no sleep and and no food and being downtrodden and cast out and then come to the end of it and my reward be taken from me and i would be a castaway find myself disqualified don't you understand what the church is going to find out in the morning of the rapture don't you see what even folks have said around this message are going to realize they have been disqualified to be in the rapture oh my let me read one more can i galatians 5 24 and they that are christ's now this is possessive the christ owns them and possesses them they're not that by an external profession only but by an internal implantation of a divine deposit of the faith of the son of god for the life that i live i no longer live it by myself but i live it by the faith not in but of the son of god they that are christ's notice what he said they that are christ have not christ crucified the flesh but they your very large friends is a symbol that you're a christian all to say that people are christian today they smoke they drink they have how many ever wives and husbands and boyfriends and girlfriends they live any way they want to and yet claim they're a christian to means you are a christian it means you are christ-like what did they call them in the early days when they called him a christian they were first called christians and any it was not a descriptive term of great describing of great praise and adoration it was a name that was cast out they call them crossbacks because they carry crosses on the back well i don't have one on my back but i've got one in my life they that are christ's have crucified so here you are your soul your soul is telling your body cattle on the cross your soul has led your body down the via dela rosa you have beat it every step of the way your body fell and got weak and again he said here and pained but your soul had no pity your soul marched it up the hill in the place of the skull your mind there your soul said to your body climb on the cross and you're stole your soul stood there as your body shaking and it called its way up on the cross [Laughter] and it lay it down and your soul took the hammer and the nail oh don't please [Music] again and again then it laid the other hand out shaking and quivering your flesh screamed and you drove both feet one on top of the other then you picked it up and you said you stay there don't you ever come down you understand that the romans were not the first ones to crucify the carthagins many others did but the romans brought it to a stage of perfection the romans assigned a guard with a centurion that would stay there to watch the crucified because actually what would happen before they did this say one of you men was crucified and the romans would leave you there your family would come and pull you off the cross and you would live you see crucifixion is not necessarily an instant death every year in the philippines there are people who get crucified i saw a documentary not long ago of a man that's been crucified 15 years in a row nails drove through his hands nails jolts or his feet and he hangs there from the morning to the afternoon by the afternoon they take him down off the cross and he's done this for 15 years in a row revival after revival youth camp after youth camp oh god i promise i promise god our brothers are but you've got to have a guard or a pastor [Applause] hallelujah when you go to drag hunt out that claw hammer out of your tool pat ready to remove them nails the pastor said i had put that back oh sorry so that's all i packed mine there too and i've learned how to crucify my you think i want to die you think i love being a laughing stock around the world do you think i love my name being ridiculed you think i love being one of the most ridiculed and lifetime preachers in the message you think i enjoy that i have to die to myself every video i see with my name on it every letter every email because i think why me why do i have to deal with a whole fest i want to drag up my glow hammer and pull these nails out of my hands and throw them as far as i can throw them and never look back but my soul says my soul is threatened to get rid of that claw hammer and give me a ball pen which has no claws let's stand now that y'all i've left you suspended right some of y'all's got one arm in and one arm out and you're think of it friends they that are christ have crucified isn't it amazing that paul says they have done it it's no wonder that when the prophet of god it was carried there beyond the curtain of time even when the prophecy was given to him a huge portion of heaven awaits you why because of his choice his choice can you imagine how your body will be on that day of the change when finally you're able to pull the nails out for the last time and your body will be pulled down off of the cross your soul would have led your body into eternal eyes eternal lips eternal teeth eternal bones eternal hands eternal feet the same body that nailed it to the cross will lead it to the theophany and say i'd like to introduce you to yourself you see to be a christian is what this embraces to show conformity to our crucified lord jesus who died a death of shame humiliation and pain remember the cross was barely erased off the ground so people on the ground would come by and smack them as i mentioned it to you a week or so ago actually the jackals and the coyotes would tear the skin off of their legs tear the skin off their feet the birds would eat their eyes out and they're still alive they would hang there for days the longest one so far that i've been able to find historically is about 18 days can you imagine gang green sets in the body gangrene your own body rottening and they've got somebody there garden let your family come and take you down we would be deserving of such a death but this holy righteous one not only subjected himself to mortality but subjected himself to this kind of death you see the lord jesus went through more than most people ever go through life and death just getting to the cross much less the cross then the sins of all the world placed on him that horrible pain and suffering of the transfer of our sins spirit god the angels the cherubims the seraphims the zunes all the heavenly beings turning their back as it was and him saying my god my god why hast thou forsaken me hallelujah why so you could stand here today and hang your body on a cross when your body would say to you why have you forsaken me you'll have to say cause i love you if i listen to you you'll take me to hell if you listen to me i'll take you to heaven is that right in his time when mortification is setting in when his body is so shaking and quivering with pain while he's on the cross but a man also on the cross lord when you come into your kingdom remember me most of us would not even categorize that as a prayer of repentance he doesn't mention any wrongs he's done he doesn't say i'm a sinner he doesn't say i've drunk i've run around i've done this i've done that i've done that he don't even say nothing like that but he acknowledges what it takes to get in you're the king remember me can you imagine the lord jesus and all that agony and pain looks to him and said today you will be with me in paradise oh i'd love to been there for just a few moments when him and jesus arrive there was abraham isaac jacob joseph ezekiel jeremiah zephaniah got malachi thousands times thousands there and this man comes and said who are you how did you get here it happened just a few moments ago what was your prophet i was a thief was you're a good man i died because of my sins but i realized that man on the cross was the way to life praise god thank you lord jesus friends we don't want church hannity we don't want religion we want new births no birth and a surrendered life that comes in conformity with that new birthday amen come with our heads together brother gary has a friend he wants us to pray for rick culler his family's been called to the hospital virus and very critical how many of you today would like to be remembered before the lord maybe not sickness in your body you'd like to be more of a surrendered person to the lord i'll raise my hands both of them lord jesus thank you for the service today i know it's not one to make a shout but if we'll get it we'll shout after a while ain't no question about it if we can apply this to our lives and live by it every day we will shout through the ceaseless ages of eternity oh we like deeper things better we like other things better that make us feel good but it wasn't lord jesus those things that make the flesh feel good that paid my redemption it was your pain you're suffering oh lord god i thank you for it emptying yourself out letting satan by the be of death strike your body you become a curse for us all for it is written cursed is everyone that hang us on a tree thank you lord jesus but we are so glad you didn't just die but you raised from the dead praise god and you were raised for our justification father help us we realize this is not something that happens instantaneously as the new person with that nature of the world the world in nature we were born with in the soul whenever you get it to the altar and the pillar of fire breaks on that nature it destroys it your prophet projects it so beautifully and you must be born again in 1961 that the judgment of god the wrath of god falls on that nature it's annihilated and that little seed germ which was part of the father's thinking the father's gene it sprang to life at the death of that old man so we're not forgiven we're justified that oh life and forgiven that old nature ain't forgiven has saint there is no scripture in the entire canon of the bible that says that old life ever is sanctified our battle life is refurbished but the old man died praise god and we were born again thank you lord jesus help us i pray father lord you see the time we're in father we can feel it we can feel it around us we can see it lord i saw pictures of it today even in some of our cities they're boarding up windows and boarding up stores boarding up residences and some of these movie stars and millionaires hiring security services to come and patrol their properties because they're expecting such things in the time of the election who would have ever thought that our nation supposedly the home of the free the land of the brave and the home of the free and even men sitting right here today that risked their life to buy us this freedom lord where will we come to because we left you out this is where we are oh god i pray that you'll help us watch over your children lord mayhem we know will rain one day but lord jesus we ask that you be mindful of your bride help us lord god that we can live the kind of life that's pleasing to you every day lord jesus we're not waiting for some special speaker to come we're not waiting for some special meeting to come and then we're going to get some type of miraculous prayer but father we want to begin today that we are the kind of christians you want us to be we're sorry for laying all of it at your door and saying you have to do it surely they see it lord after these scriptures today it's you and us working together to bring it to pass it's really a marvel because you don't need our help in dealing with the soul just our consent that's all you don't really ask for help so you by the pillar of fire devour the nature that's there and it dies you birth your own seed your own son or daughter we're birthed by the breath of god the holy ghost but then you incorporate us in that everyday life of surrendering so when people hurt our feelings or people offend us over and over again our flesh wants to act back lord we want to get even with them we want to say this or that the other or do this or that or the other but the soul says father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing lord i ain't just talking about people running around smoking committing adultery i'm just talking everyday stuff having a nice word and in the place of a of a bad foul word or a rough word just everyday kind of life lord that's what we want to be just everyday christians help us today father in the name of jesus praise god you love him saints with all your hearts what do you say we have an invisible altar call this morning now no doubt many of you in the past have laid your cigarettes as it were on the altar and you you've laid your worldly music on the altar some of you laid your pornographic websites on the altar i say today that we all beginning with me take our claw hammer or our pry bar or our crowbar we lay our ability to remove these nails out of our hands on the altar of god and say god by your help and grace i will never try to free myself again look friends you might as well like some of the things you deal with in life at your cross some of your burdens some of your family some of the things you have to do some of the things you have to put up with you'll never pray it away but you can pray god will give you grace and strength to be able to bear it and sometimes we don't bury it well when we're complaining and grumbling we lose the value of our cross when we grumble about it every day how many needs help with it me too so what you say let's just lay our claw hammers at the altar let's lay our grumbling attitude as the altar say lord from this day forward by your grace and mercy if you will help me lord i want to be a better man i want to be a better woman i talk about the new birth now you're working yourself to a new birth no totally separate but you bringing this subject to a life committed to god and he agrees with me today that's what we want as children of god god bless you
