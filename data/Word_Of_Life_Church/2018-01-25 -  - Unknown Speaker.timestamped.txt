[9:34] know sickness comes from Satan we know
[9:36] it didn't come from you we know it's not
[9:38] your will that we'd be sick and we know
[9:39] that we need only ask we don't have to

[28:09] of God
[28:18] the team that texted me the other day

[28:22] best you can what was that you said we
[28:24] could do Skype or I put something I told
[28:30] a message you'd be surprised what a
[28:33] difference then lick sapphire make we
[28:36] could get on skype and hype and I'd be
[28:39] hyped probably they could do all of that
[28:41] but it wouldn't be the same because I'm
[28:44] not the one who creates it it's all of
[28:49] us together
[28:50] that makes me feel sad tonight that some
[28:53] are still sick and not able to be here
[28:55] we're certainly want to remember them
[28:57] that God will just be mindful of them
[28:59] but I'm glad we could be praise the Lord
[29:04] let's turn to the book of Ephesians if
[29:06] you would tonight
[29:09] I've just been been contacted by some
[29:13] different ones so that the internet was
[29:15] down thinking with Scott him whoever
[29:17] Moore's meant up her trying to get it up
[29:18] and going people were in panic mode
[29:20] because the website was down but
[29:23] hopefully they got it got it up and go
[29:25] on and got it fixed Ephesians chapter 3
[29:29] verse said and we'd like to speak again
[29:32] tonight about the church I'm glad I'm
[29:34] part of it I want you to listen these
[29:37] passages of Scripture you tell them
[29:38] about wonderful where of I am made a
[29:43] minister according to the gift of the
[29:48] grace of God now this is a real man
[29:52] that's called of God
[29:54] a real gifted man this is what makes a
[29:58] god called preacher not because a man
[30:01] wants to be now because his daddy was
[30:03] his grandpa was I am made a minister
[30:06] according to the gift of the grace of
[30:09] God given unto me by the effectual
[30:15] working of his power
[30:18] praise God unto me Who am less than the
[30:23] least of All Saints
[30:27] that's a real preacher this guy that
[30:30] walks around like this forget it in
[30:32] Orono way less than the least of All
[30:37] Saints is this grace given that I should
[30:42] preach among the Gentiles the
[30:47] unsearchable riches of Christ praise God
[30:54] and to make all men see what is the
[30:59] Fellowship of the mystery which from
[31:02] listen the beginning of the world hath
[31:06] been hid in God who created all things
[31:09] by Jesus Christ to the intent that now
[31:15] unto the principalities and powers in
[31:19] heavenly places might be known by the
[31:25] church the manifold wisdom of God so God
[31:33] is going to prove to principalities and
[31:35] powers and demons and hierarchies all
[31:42] that he wants to prove he's going to
[31:46] prove it by the church you mean he
[31:52] didn't prove that when he made the earth
[31:54] when he made the universe and he made
[31:56] billions of stars when he made no he's
[32:01] going to prove that by you
[32:05] well let us all go to Derry claim we've

[34:00] able to step aside may the presence of
[34:03] God come anoint this this part in me
[34:06] that Paul described or my portion is so
[34:10] much smaller than his was uh if he was
[34:13] the least Lord what am i what would be
[34:16] even the least among
[34:17] least of the saints I would even smaller
[34:20] than that but redeemed I stand here
[34:23] tonight by the power of God and I wish
[34:26] to speak as the Oracle of God take this
[34:29] service Lord speak to us your precious
[34:31] words as we feed on the unfailing body
[34:34] word of the son of man it's in the name
[34:36] of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen god
[34:40] bless you say Jimmy you may be seated
[34:48] what a great thing a great purpose a
[34:53] great plan that the eternal one devised
[34:58] to be able to show such glory manifold
[35:04] wisdom the word manifold means
[35:08] variegated it means that it comes in one
[35:13] Avenue and another and another and
[35:16] another and another and another
[35:20] it takes so many ways to be able to even
[35:25] barely touch the greatness of God that
[35:30] he chose variegated manifold ways by
[35:35] which he would reveal his greatness
[35:38] through the flaws or the weakness of the
[35:42] church instead of choosing perfect
[35:47] angelic beings instead of choosing
[35:51] perfect people if there was such he
[35:55] chose the variegated weakness failures
[35:59] mistakes of the church we would never
[36:07] even consider to do such a thing to us
[36:12] it would be an act of such condescension
[36:15] that we could never think of doing it
[36:18] you know most of us don't like getting
[36:21] our hands dirty when it comes to dealing
[36:26] with people you know people well I'll
[36:29] help her brother and
[36:30] you know people don't don't think I'm
[36:33] kind of bad you know Jesus was the type
[36:35] of individual that he could go out and
[36:37] be able to reach to people that was so
[36:40] bad the scribes and the Pharisees that's
[36:43] one of the things that they had against
[36:44] him because prostitutes sinners
[36:47] they hung around where he was Jesus is
[36:51] willing to get his hands dirty I'm not
[36:53] telling my participating in San now but
[36:56] I'm talking about sometimes people
[36:58] looking at saying why the world would
[37:00] you go over and preach for an old guy
[37:01] there used to be seven Thunder why would
[37:03] you preach for an old guy there used to
[37:05] be this and that and the other well
[37:06] sometimes they need that time a lot of
[37:10] us who know how I'm gonna do that
[37:12] somebody might think I'm seven thunders
[37:13] they hear me preach they'll no lie but
[37:16] we saw afraid we're so afraid our holy
[37:19] holy whatever we think we are that some
[37:22] after all my goodness now come on you
[37:25] PI's hypocrite come on down to the level
[37:27] where the rest of us are but you realize
[37:30] through the weakness that God himself
[37:32] decided to manifold manifest his
[37:36] manifold greatness through the eternal
[37:39] purpose that was purposed in Christ
[37:40] Jesus before the world began and he
[37:44] called it mice Paul termed it that he
[37:46] was going to manifest it through this
[37:47] channel call the church now in the
[37:51] church as we've already looked at
[37:53] there'll be two groups that will be
[37:55] called Church it will be the elect of
[37:56] God the ecclesia of God and then it will
[37:59] be the other group which are just people
[38:01] that attend they go when they want they
[38:03] join themselves together with an
[38:05] association but the real church are the
[38:08] born-again the real church is actually
[38:13] new creatures in Christ Jesus let's look
[38:17] at a second Corinthians chapter 5 verse
[38:19] 17 therefore if any man be
[38:22] in Christ he is a new create creature
[38:27] old things are passed away behold a few
[38:34] things over now men all things are
[38:38] become now they're not just new they
[38:42] become new they come into existence by
[38:47] creation why because you did you come
[38:53] into existence
[38:55] you came to pass as many has believed on
[39:00] him to him to them gave he the power to
[39:03] become that word is to come to pass
[39:08] you were an unregenerate a gene of God
[39:12] but the new birth brought you to pass
[39:16] [Applause]
[39:18] you are a prophecy in gene form you are
[39:23] a prophecy in seed form and the new
[39:27] birth brought you to pass thank you Lord
[39:31] Jesus
[39:32] Oh hallelujah so to be in Christ of
[39:36] course we know that it the notes and
[39:38] means more than just being around the
[39:40] church and while I'm a Christian and I I
[39:42] believe the serpent seed I believe
[39:44] marriage divorce I believe I believe I
[39:45] believe the devil can do the same thing
[39:47] and not be in Christ so to be in Christ
[39:50] is to be a new created Union it is not
[39:54] something that God worked over but it is
[39:57] actually something that is brand new now
[40:00] this is why it's so difficult and many
[40:02] people think they're born again or not
[40:04] but to look at what Paul said that we
[40:06] are a new creature in Christ Jesus so it
[40:10] denotes further more it is not just
[40:12] shaking a preacher's hand come enjoying
[40:14] an allegiance with people that believe
[40:16] this and that and the other but it is
[40:18] something that God alone can do the
[40:22] preacher cannot give you a new birth if
[40:26] brother Branham was here he could not
[40:27] give you under burst
[40:29] now man of God can lead you through the
[40:32] seaching in themselves in the right way
[40:34] to lead you to the process of a new
[40:36] birth but they do not have the power to
[40:38] do it themselves it is as the glory of
[40:41] the branch partakes of the vine and the
[40:44] life that is in the vine is manifested
[40:48] itself in the many many variegated type
[40:51] of branches that would be on a grape
[40:53] vine or whatever more some would be
[40:55] short some of the slender some would be
[40:57] fat some would be twisted someone might
[40:59] be contorted a little more than others
[41:00] but the life of the vine take each one
[41:03] of them all as diverse as they would be
[41:05] and the very life of the vine would be
[41:07] identified in each branch so God saves
[41:11] us God brings us to himself many of your
[41:14] pass is so much different than mine some
[41:16] of your pass is so much different than
[41:18] your wife or your husband or maybe other
[41:20] people that you come to church with and
[41:22] the manifold wisdom of God saves you
[41:25] brought zoom out and is shaping you
[41:27] molding their life getting you ready for
[41:30] a rapture the way he's dealing with you
[41:32] may be totally different than the way
[41:34] he's dealing with a person sitting by
[41:36] him yeah the grace of God in a
[41:38] manifested way will bring each one of us
[41:41] all together can you imagine when we all
[41:43] stand there million-strong
[41:45] and each one of us goes to sharing our
[41:48] testimony all of us are there by the
[41:51] grace of God all of us are there because
[41:53] of what he did at Calvary all of us are
[41:56] there because of unmerited favors that
[41:58] right but yet every one of us will have
[42:01] a little bit different testimony why
[42:03] because he loves to express himself and
[42:07] a variegated manifold away Oh glory to
[42:12] God that by the church by the church now
[42:17] this is the verdurous that so caught me
[42:19] and reading this by the church the
[42:21] manifold wisdom of God now Paul then
[42:25] bringing this over to being a new
[42:27] creature in Christ Jesus notice this he
[42:29] says if any
[42:30] man be in Christ he is a new creature
[42:34] now look at what this word means
[42:36] as a respects form recently made fresh
[42:39] on use unworn new which as recently made
[42:44] is superior to what it succeeds as a
[42:49] respect substance of a new kind
[42:53] unprecedented novel uncommon unheard of
[42:58] man that how in the world can a person
[43:02] be a new creature in Christ Jesus
[43:04] psyllium talk and do the same way they
[43:07] did before they become a Christian
[43:09] there's something wrong somewhere friend
[43:11] now there's absolutely something missing
[43:14] somewhere because the Word of God cannot
[43:16] lie if we are in Christ Jesus we have
[43:19] never been heard of before that new
[43:21] person in you was not made over it
[43:24] wasn't at all 1932 jalopy that was run
[43:27] into a body shop somewhere and they
[43:30] throat some bondo in the rust and they
[43:32] fixed the rubber and they put a little
[43:33] primer on in six months it'll fall out
[43:36] you are not bonded you are brand new new
[43:42] in the Greek Empire a new nature quite
[43:46] different from anything previously
[43:49] existing Oh glory
[43:51] the man is made brand new a man he is
[43:55] actually a little world in himself now
[44:00] look at the way God made whenever the
[44:02] God began to move upon the earth as we
[44:03] looked at it many many times when it
[44:05] come from his pristine condition and
[44:07] verse one - its chaotic condition in
[44:09] verse two of Genesis and we see that God
[44:12] does the same thing to you or not you
[44:14] are the reverse process of Genesis 1:1
[44:17] and Genesis 1:2 in the beginning God
[44:20] created the heavens and the earth first
[44:21] - of course there are souls without form
[44:23] and void and darkness covered the face
[44:24] of the deep it moves from this pristine
[44:26] condition of Genesis 1:1 - its chaotic
[44:29] condition of Genesis 1:2 and the new
[44:32] bursters exact opposite to you which
[44:34] means the earth is following you back
[44:36] all glory to God Vic
[44:38] God took you you were born into this
[44:41] world not in verse one but you are born
[44:44] in verse soon he was a mess
[44:47] he was a Hulk he was a liar he was a
[44:51] sinner he was lost he was pitiful
[44:55] he was wretched you was blind he was
[44:57] later seen but the Spirit of God moved
[45:01] upon you and God rejuvinated you and
[45:05] brought you from chaos to Christine you
[45:12] are a little world within yourself your
[45:17] atmospheres changed your diets change
[45:19] your destinies changed you're a new
[45:24] creation hey man you're a new creature
[45:28] in Christ Jesus I'm talking about the
[45:32] church now hope if you kind of got away
[45:34] from that little thing when I first
[45:35] started in this several weeks ago that
[45:37] Samuel did not being called the church
[45:40] and this is the church I'm talking about
[45:43] not the church the church amen notice
[45:49] that whenever Paul uses this word
[45:51] actually the word creature that the
[45:53] English word use it's literally creation
[45:56] so you are a new creation
[45:58] so the creates the creature results from
[46:02] the creation itself so we are in Christ
[46:05] Jesus a new creature by the creation of
[46:09] God you with me tonight now these new
[46:12] creatures then must live a new life they
[46:15] of course new headship they switch from
[46:17] the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom
[46:19] of life notice Titus chapter 3 verse 4
[46:22] but I do that the kindness and love of
[46:25] God our Savior amen the love of God our
[46:29] Savior toward man appeared not by works
[46:32] of righteousness which we have done but
[46:35] according to His mercy he saved us by
[46:40] the washing of regeneration
[46:46] and renewing of the Holy Ghost oh praise
[46:56] the Lord by the washing which is Lutron
[47:01] bathing bass they act of bathing this is
[47:07] not water baptism now notice what Paul
[47:10] says the washing not a water but of
[47:14] regeneration this is home so parallels
[47:18] Ephesians when he said the washing of
[47:19] the water with the word but can
[47:21] regeneration new verse so you're
[47:24] actually washed into a new verse man
[47:33] amen
[47:34] reproduction renewal recreation
[47:38] regeneration
[47:41] hence renovation the prompt the product
[47:45] to production rather of a new life
[47:47] consecrated to God a radical change of
[47:51] mind for the better the word often used
[47:55] to denote the restoration of a thing to
[47:57] its Genesis one state pristine its
[48:09] renovation as a renewal or restoration
[48:13] now notice he says according to His
[48:15] mercy he saved us by the washing of
[48:18] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[48:23] Ghost renewal renovation complete change
[48:27] for the better
[48:29] Wow so you mean the seed of God got a
[48:35] renewal of the Holy Ghost
[48:40] well now this is your Bible right y'all
[48:46] do believe your Bible defeasance to tell
[48:54] for we are his workmanship created in
[49:00] Christ Jesus so when was Christ Jesus
[49:08] created we are his workmanship created
[49:14] in Christ Jesus you understand this work
[49:20] did not begin in you it did not begin in
[49:25] me
[49:26] it began in Christ Jesus what is the
[49:31] Holy Ghost
[49:32] he'll depositing your part of creation
[49:37] out of his own being this new birth this
[49:44] new creation did not start in you
[49:48] it started in him when he went from the
[49:52] eternal and the farm of the world and to
[49:55] the farm of the logos you don't remember
[49:57] the course not but you was there for we
[50:03] are his workmanship created in Christ
[50:06] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[50:11] before ordained that we should walk in
[50:15] them this my brother sister is the
[50:19] church if he sins for 21 if so be that
[50:23] you have heard him and have been taught
[50:25] by him as the truth is in Jesus that ye
[50:30] put off concerning the former
[50:32] conversation the old man which is
[50:35] corrupt according to the deceitful lusts
[50:39] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[50:43] mind
[50:44] that ye put on the new man which after
[50:49] God is created in righteousness and true
[50:57] holiness this is why you can't join this
[51:02] this is why you can have your name on
[51:04] every Church in the tri-cities in their
[51:07] church book if you'd still be lost God's
[51:10] the only one that can do this you can
[51:13] send it Happy Valley you can set a never
[51:15] mr. Church around the world
[51:16] God's the only one that can do this
[51:19] [Applause]

[54:40] Paul said let him that steal stole still
[54:43] no more but rather let him labor working
[54:46] with his hands must have been some lazy
[54:48] folks yesterday and this amazing now the
[54:52] Ephesian Church was one of the deepest
[54:54] churches in the New Testament they
[54:57] believed an election predestination
[54:59] foreknowledge of God boy you could
[55:00] preach it to them and then scream and
[55:02] holler but they had some line Saints
[55:04] among them
[55:05] and they had some apparently was lazy
[55:11] yes friends this is the pastor case you
[55:14] were wondering offensive visiting
[55:15] minister let him that stole steal no
[55:18] more that rather let him labor working
[55:21] with his hands the thing which is good
[55:23] that he may have to give to him that
[55:25] needeth this is what a lot of folks look
[55:28] at the church the church is a welfare

[55:45] your mouth but that which is good to the
[55:46] use of edifying that it may Minister
[55:49] grace unto the year saying you imagine
[55:51] speaking these great deep things that he
[55:54] would follow up with simple things like
[55:55] this on an everyday life Wow that's
[55:58] whether that's where the rubber brother
[55:59] meets the road well any man you always
[56:02] just turned out the tire the pads off
[56:04] the piers a while ago on that deep part
[56:06] now come to this stuff and everybody
[56:07] kind of pulled in their shell like a
[56:09] turtle a man notice again Romans chapter
[56:13] 8 verse 12 that for brethren we are
[56:15] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[56:18] the flesh and the church said for if you
[56:21] leave back to the flesh you shall die
[56:23] but if you through the spirit do mortify
[56:26] the deeds of the body you mean to tell
[56:32] me this man after Romans seven still
[56:37] believe that the flesh was different
[56:39] from the Holy Ghost in the soul well
[56:45] praise the Lord
[56:46] Paul was still holding on to that yep
[56:49] that's one of the reasons others but if
[56:52] he's thrown notice capital S prit if he
[56:56] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[57:00] of the body you shall live Colossians
[57:03] chapter 3 verse 5 mortify therefore your
[57:06] members
[57:07] ah net crew be dead to make dared to put
[57:16] to death slay worn-out deprived of power
[57:22] destroy the strength of so you mean to
[57:28] tell me a person is a new creature new
[57:31] world new atmosphere new everything and
[57:34] they still got to do this to what the
[57:39] old part cuz your new line in an old
[57:44] bottle we know what Jesus said about
[57:49] that you ran the whole bottle exactly
[57:51] the simplification of the new birth the
[57:54] new wine rims and brain subject the old
[57:58] bottle why because the old bottle is not
[58:02] flexible the old bottle is not born
[58:04] again and we have to constantly mortify
[58:07] the deeds of the body now for those of
[58:11] you feel like your flesh got saved well
[58:14] you just have to look beyond the rest of
[58:15] us sure tonight because we're still kind
[58:17] of the persuasion that our old flesh is
[58:19] our enemy I've heard the Holy Ghost for
[58:24] a long time in my soul it moves on my
[58:26] body and boy it feels good when it comes
[58:28] but as it comes it also goes I'm so glad
[58:31] but it leaves the anointing we sold my
[58:33] flesh don't leave out of my soul it
[58:36] comes it goes on my body because like it
[58:39] does yours but it don't come and go on
[58:41] my soul
[58:42] it comes and when it goes I'll go with
[58:44] it notice mortify therefore your members
[58:49] which are upon the earth what
[58:56] fornication uncleanness inordinate
[58:58] affection evil concupiscence
[59:01] covetousness which is idolatry
[59:08] the potential of these things lays in
[59:12] church people well I thought amens were
[59:20] scarce the first 15 minutes we're
[59:25] getting out where the pastor's wife
[59:27] ain't even batting her eyes she just
[59:29] kind of sent me
[59:32] the friends if this was not possible why
[59:35] would an anointed servant of God write
[59:38] these words my goodness do you
[59:44] understand in your flesh is the ability
[59:47] to commit adultery with another man's
[59:48] wife in your flesh still remains the
[59:52] ability to lie why cuz your flesh a boy
[1:00:00] oh why don't you come out at all to them
[1:00:04] why don't you lie why don't you cheat
[1:00:05] why don't you do all them things you are
[1:00:07] mortifying the deeds of your body you
[1:00:10] are keeping that body subject to the
[1:00:12] word knowing that this body is your
[1:00:14] enemy in every one of us and I raise the
[1:00:17] potential to become a coal lukewarm
[1:00:20] church member I know they don't want to
[1:00:24] accept it I know they don't like to
[1:00:26] you're a preacher say it but the
[1:00:28] inevitable is around us in this message
[1:00:30] this message will go the cycle of all
[1:00:33] the rest of the revivals it will go the
[1:00:36] rest of a cycle and all the rest of
[1:00:38] those at a live before us in them and
[1:00:40] the majority of around them will never
[1:00:42] go on with the word no sir
[1:00:44] they will become cold they'll become
[1:00:46] systemic men followers
[1:00:49] they'll be kingdom builders and kingdom
[1:00:51] builder followers but the elect will go
[1:00:53] right on the majority around this move
[1:00:56] of never going the rapture
[1:01:01] cycle of life and gas is right on us but
[1:01:07] it don't have to be on you as an
[1:01:08] individual except to you
[1:01:12] sup to me the potential is there for dis
[1:01:17] church this church to become nothing but
[1:01:22] cold dead powerless lifeless you second
[1:01:31] never happened us you're already part of
[1:01:33] the way there because you've done let
[1:01:35] down your defense thinking it can't
[1:01:36] happen to you that's part of your
[1:01:39] defense Gong rocked area so I'm exempt
[1:01:42] from that no you're not just the other
[1:01:43] human being and there's still the
[1:01:46] laziness about all of us there's a
[1:01:48] slothfulness about all of us don't you
[1:01:51] tell me I heard that prophets say
[1:01:52] yesterday 1965 he said we all need to
[1:01:55] move up I said yes Lord help me Lord God
[1:01:58] he said I need to move up you'll need
[1:02:00] them about let me say for all of us we
[1:02:02] all need to move up oh my notice for
[1:02:10] words things sake the wrath of God
[1:02:13] cometh on the children of disobedience
[1:02:16] now watch how separates the Saints from
[1:02:19] the children of disobedience
[1:02:21] why are what's the difference there they
[1:02:23] are children of disobedience because the
[1:02:25] disobedient nature from the soul is
[1:02:27] still ruling them but he said look this
[1:02:30] is the very fruit that will cause them
[1:02:32] to be condemned so you don't want to say
[1:02:34] you're born again and do the same things
[1:02:36] they do we say why didn't he give us a
[1:02:41] new verse in the body this is a better
[1:02:43] way what if you got born again by the
[1:02:48] gym and he gives you a brand new body
[1:02:50] and that Nightside sold you say praise
[1:02:52] God
[1:02:53] I've never even tempted when and walked
[1:02:56] in front of these cigarettes wine shoes
[1:02:58] it don't bother me I'm an inch

[1:03:16] is gonna bring you out of this age and
[1:03:18] look at you and say blessed are they
[1:03:20] that overcome come in or the joys of the
[1:03:24] Lord because you overcome what but he
[1:03:30] regenerates you from the soul and makes
[1:03:33] you a new creature and leaves you in
[1:03:35] prison your feelings bother you
[1:03:42] complexes bother you what people say
[1:03:45] bother you what you've even think that
[1:03:48] people say though they may not say it or
[1:03:50] even think it but we just think they're
[1:03:51] doing it bothers us they're getting you
[1:03:56] angels you excuse me tonight I've got a
[1:03:58] few humans here that we've not quite
[1:04:00] reached perfection yet so notice of
[1:04:03] course since three seven in the woods ye
[1:04:06] also won't sometime when ye lived in
[1:04:11] them and I said you remember when you
[1:04:14] walk that way that was the course of
[1:04:15] life and you lived the same place
[1:04:17] because you were on the same plane by
[1:04:19] nature but he said now your nature has
[1:04:21] been changed so you don't want to revert
[1:04:23] back to doing some of the same things
[1:04:25] you've done before you were born again
[1:04:29] but now you also put up all these anger
[1:04:33] wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[1:04:38] communication out of your mouth worship
[1:04:42] of Donnie I don't curse I'll tell you
[1:04:44] what I get mad I hit my finger the other
[1:04:47] day brother done
[1:04:47] I don't cuss let me tell you something
[1:04:49] Fred many folks don't cuss but they
[1:04:53] taught the devil's language
[1:04:56] I ain't got no faith I'm not a good
[1:04:59] Christian I'm not going in the rapture
[1:05:01] I don't believe brother Donnie loves me
[1:05:02] I don't believe the church loves me the
[1:05:04] prophet of God said when you say that
[1:05:06] ain't got good faith along Chicago 1955
[1:05:08] you're talking the devil's language that
[1:05:13] should never go out of your mouth well
[1:05:21] there must have been some problem with
[1:05:23] some Liars at the church at Colossae
[1:05:26] ly not one to another I know that Happy
[1:05:33] Valley there's no people like that here
[1:05:35] but there's people that stream these
[1:05:38] services all over the world rotten
[1:05:41] lowdown and sorry I not want to another
[1:05:48] scene that you have put off the old man
[1:05:54] with his deeds a man and have put on
[1:05:59] them the new man which is renewed in
[1:06:04] knowledge after the image of him that
[1:06:08] created him
[1:06:12] this is the church verse 12
[1:06:16] put on therefore as the elect of God
[1:06:20] holy and beloved bowels of mercies well
[1:06:26] shouldn't that go pretty much unsaid and
[1:06:30] that shouldn't be a common denominator
[1:06:32] the common factor among the elect of God
[1:06:34] that's automatic apparently not
[1:06:39] apparently we need to be reminded
[1:06:43] well you know what that tells me if
[1:06:45] we're told to put on bowels of mercies
[1:06:47] that means that somehow another you're
[1:06:49] going to need them kindness kindness in
[1:06:54] other words you're going to be so tried
[1:06:57] by people to see whether you will show
[1:07:00] them kindness or not or revenge I'll get
[1:07:06] him back I'll tell you one thing I'll
[1:07:08] get him he done this and this and she
[1:07:11] done this and this to me
[1:07:12] I won't speak to her the next time I see
[1:07:14] her that you're going beneath them
[1:07:16] they're not going above it climb higher
[1:07:19] like Jesus did and speak to those who
[1:07:22] hate you well praise the Lord
[1:07:31] Mercy's my kindness humbleness of mind
[1:07:39] instead of thinking that you are the
[1:07:42] pivotal point of the whole universe
[1:07:49] you know the scientists many many
[1:07:52] hundreds of years ago thought that the
[1:07:54] earth was the center of the universe I
[1:08:00] imagine if they could peer into the eyes
[1:08:04] of Hubble into deep space if they
[1:08:09] wouldn't even have to do that if they
[1:08:12] could just look up in the open sky and
[1:08:15] not especially from September through
[1:08:20] March and they will look up into the
[1:08:23] belt of Orion come left and look at the
[1:08:27] seventh brightest star in the sky
[1:08:31] migaila
[1:08:34] which is eight hundred light years away
[1:08:39] that means nothing to you I know five
[1:08:41] point eight trillion miles is a lot year
[1:08:49] then they would look up and be able to
[1:08:52] manage her and see that distance and the
[1:08:54] light if you look at Adam tonight and
[1:08:56] see yeah I want you to keep this in mind
[1:08:58] the light that you are seeing coming
[1:09:01] from Raquel started 250 years before
[1:09:06] Christopher Columbus ever found America
[1:09:15] it's that far from there and if you took
[1:09:20] off tomorrow in the space shuttle to
[1:09:22] even make a trip to it it would take you
[1:09:26] 40,000 years so you see those who feel
[1:09:38] like they are so important irreplaceable
[1:09:42] get alive
[1:09:44] wake up yet the life of Christ let him
[1:09:49] take that selfish attitude out of you
[1:09:52] come on Saints Oh humbleness of mine
[1:09:58] neatness long-suffering praise God
[1:10:02] preach it Paul forbearing one another
[1:10:05] and forgiving one another If any man
[1:10:08] have a quarrel against any you mean
[1:10:12] there's some of them deep saints that
[1:10:14] Colossus was courted with one another
[1:10:18] If any man have a quarrel against any
[1:10:21] this is what to do on Facebook even as
[1:10:26] Christ forgave you ye also so also do
[1:10:33] you praise be to God and above all these
[1:10:41] things put on charity which is the bond
[1:10:46] of perfectness and let the peace of God
[1:10:51] rule in your hearts to the which also
[1:10:55] you are called in one body and be
[1:10:58] thankful that the world of Christ dwell
[1:11:03] in you richly in all wisdom teaching and
[1:11:07] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[1:11:10] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[1:11:13] grace and your hearts to the Lord
[1:11:19] my brother's sister I just read to you
[1:11:22] the true identification of the Church of
[1:11:25] the Living God
[1:11:26] [Applause]
[1:11:31] now through the new burst the believer
[1:11:35] becomes a per taker of the divine nature
[1:11:38] and this is what allows him to do these
[1:11:41] things we just read other people were
[1:11:44] recently I know I know I know I'm trying
[1:11:46] I'm trying I'm trying to get this book
[1:11:48] on how to be a Christian for dummies and
[1:11:50] I'm trying to figure how to do all this
[1:11:52] that's why the world is so smothered in
[1:11:54] their perversion of grace and they've
[1:11:57] turned it into a disgrace
[1:12:01] they can't live these Saints that they
[1:12:03] gotta make up a reason why if you can
[1:12:08] live it I'll tell you why the new birth
[1:12:10] doesn't happen in your soul it's quite
[1:12:12] simple
[1:12:14] God lives his word whether it lives it
[1:12:17] in my body or your body or Jesus body or
[1:12:19] Paul's ball what's this English in
[1:12:22] chapter 2 verse 20 I am crucified with
[1:12:24] Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but
[1:12:26] Christ liveth him and can you imagine
[1:12:29] Christ Jesus living in a man and him
[1:12:32] going out smoking marijuana jesus said I
[1:12:40] forgive you I forgive you I forgive you
[1:12:41] thank you don't forgive me when the
[1:12:45] controlling power of the Resurrection
[1:12:47] that men's body is so out of control he
[1:12:50] has to shoot up everyday four or five
[1:12:52] times a day he can't keep his eyes off
[1:12:54] for women he can't keep away from
[1:12:56] prostitutes and Christ is in him the
[1:12:59] Christ that created the universe and he
[1:13:02] has no more power over this flimsy flesh
[1:13:05] than to bring it subject to the word
[1:13:11] I am crucified with Christ nevertheless
[1:13:22] I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[1:13:28] and the life the life which I now live
[1:13:36] in though I live by the faith not in but
[1:13:48] of the Son of God praise God here's the
[1:13:56] church friends as we know her the bride
[1:13:58] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:14:02] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:14:06] don't stop on those last few words and
[1:14:09] just focus all he loved me he loved me
[1:14:11] he loved me he gave himself from it
[1:14:13] you're not saying all he said the proof
[1:14:17] of his love for you goes deeper than
[1:14:20] saving you the proof of his love for you
[1:14:23] sir he died for me it's him living in
[1:14:30] you him dying for you him saving for you
[1:14:34] made way for the third phase of him
[1:14:37] getting in you to live his whole life my
[1:14:41] brother sister that's what makes hell
[1:14:43] tremble praise be to God notice cost in
[1:14:47] chapter 1 verse 27 to whom god would
[1:14:50] make known what is the riches of the
[1:14:54] glory of this mystery among the gentiles
[1:14:59] which is christ and brother Adam
[1:15:04] Carson Paul Carson the possum Christ in
[1:15:12] the hope of glory this is the church
[1:15:18] brother Donnie I know you're going buddy
[1:15:21] but I know I'm going with you
[1:15:23] well I know my marbles going home
[1:15:25] brother Dale's a good man how telophase
[1:15:27] any of the Deacons going out of heavy
[1:15:28] Valley it'll wind up being brother Dale
[1:15:30] you need to have confidence out on it
[1:15:32] but the Dow but in your own experience
[1:15:34] with God first Peter 1:23 being born
[1:15:38] again not of corruptible seed but of
[1:15:43] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[1:15:46] liveth and abideth forever for all flesh
[1:15:49] is as grass and the glory of man is a
[1:15:52] flower of grass the grass withers and
[1:15:53] the flower thereof falleth away but the
[1:15:57] word of the Lord endures forever and
[1:16:00] this is the word by which the gospel is
[1:16:04] preached unto you
[1:16:07] you mean they just don't go around
[1:16:09] reading Jesus quotes praise be to God a
[1:16:17] man who could preach better than Jesus
[1:16:21] you st. matthew mark luke john timothy
[1:16:24] titus philemon i think any of those
[1:16:26] brothers could yeah two priests ought to
[1:16:29] Lord Jesus but the Commission was preach
[1:16:37] the word those who take brother Branham
[1:16:41] out of the Apostolic view of the word
[1:16:44] and say all we should do plays play
[1:16:47] tapes they're doing worse degradation to
[1:16:50] this message than the people who have
[1:16:52] left it because you know what they're
[1:16:55] doing they're removing brother Branham
[1:16:57] from the New Testament view and making
[1:17:00] him an Old Testament prophet where all
[1:17:02] you would hear in the days of Moses was
[1:17:04] Moses all you would hear in the days of
[1:17:07] Jeremiah is Jeremiah
[1:17:09] yet here in the days of those other men
[1:17:11] of godless they're men of God in that
[1:17:13] alone but when you come to the New
[1:17:15] Testament God sent forth one messenger
[1:17:18] out from underneath that messenger goes
[1:17:20] the ministry of others they are placing
[1:17:23] brother Branham as an Old Testament
[1:17:24] prophet
[1:17:25] therefore they make him no mouth think
[1:17:27] of it they make him where he cannot turn
[1:17:30] our hearts back to the Apostolic fathers
[1:17:32] [Applause]
[1:17:39] praise be to God
[1:17:41] now the second Peter chapter 1 verse 4
[1:17:45] where a bow are given unto us exceeding
[1:17:47] great and precious promises oma that
[1:17:51] byesies ye might be partakers of the
[1:18:01] divine nature are you all ready for this

[1:23:20] and everybody's so delicate in this day
[1:23:24] that they get their feelings hurt over
[1:23:26] anything but I went hit and put it my
[1:23:30] notice I call go and read James chapter
[1:23:34] 1 verse 18 Oh Oh begat he us with thee
[1:23:45] well
[1:23:48] Oh No now I'm gonna feel people if you
[1:24:00] said if you're offended at this word you
[1:24:04] need to get saved well I don't
[1:24:09] understand then they've got nothing to
[1:24:10] do with that this is God's Word it's
[1:24:12] infallible not 3/4 his will 1/4 yours
[1:24:19] 2/3 years one third years
[1:24:20] 10% him 90% you come on read the word
[1:24:24] the way it says of his own will begat he
[1:24:28] us with our word of truth so your
[1:24:37] regeneration is to be traced solely
[1:24:41] solely the old creation was by the word
[1:24:57] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:25:00] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:25:02] and the same as in the beginning with
[1:25:05] God
[1:25:05] then Genesis 1:1 again in the beginning
[1:25:07] God created the heavens and the earth
[1:25:10] how did it come by his own will so how's
[1:25:16] the second birth the new creation how
[1:25:19] does it come
[1:25:21] his older I'm thinking about creating
[1:25:25] some Christians how many's on my side
[1:25:27] this is a Democratic Republic now let's
[1:25:29] all vote for who's on my side and then
[1:25:31] if you vote with me then you will free
[1:25:33] me a prom idea the omnipotent God who
[1:25:36] does all these things and I can do what
[1:25:37] I want to do trade that little god of
[1:25:40] yours for a big God
[1:25:43] for a big God that is so unlimited so
[1:25:54] did the old creation have to answer to
[1:25:57] God and God speak to the Earth's and our
[1:25:58] tourists and Orion and regale and all
[1:26:01] those trillions of stars had turned said
[1:26:03] hey look I uh I had this program in my
[1:26:06] mind I'm thinking about making a bunch
[1:26:07] of stars but now you know the thing I
[1:26:10] had on my mind was that each of you
[1:26:12] would differ in luminosity now what that
[1:26:15] means is that that rigger a girl will be
[1:26:18] the seventh brightest star of Venus of a
[1:26:20] stone stone stone so others that you
[1:26:22] will be just you know you you won't be
[1:26:24] so much and you'll just be barely about
[1:26:26] a there y'all agree with that I know a
[1:26:31] way to make your God you mean I don't
[1:26:34] get to be on the belt of Orion no no no
[1:26:38] no well what about cleanest major no
[1:26:43] actually you don't get there either when
[1:26:45] I understand there's some great red
[1:26:47] giants a time I read no I have had a
[1:26:50] thought of you have a real small dwarf
[1:26:52] star I figured Casa de Paul guns in the
[1:26:58] family
[1:27:05] so they do you know who he asked
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:15] he started speaking and throwing them
[1:27:22] out there scientists say there are more
[1:27:26] stars in the heavens
[1:27:27] then there are human names on earth to
[1:27:30] call them
[1:27:31] I had a fifth the other day when I read
[1:27:34] that because I thought yeah I can agree
[1:27:37] with that that shows the punitive man's
[1:27:39] small canary brain there may be not
[1:27:42] enough names on the earth but there's
[1:27:44] enough names up in heaven that he threw
[1:27:47] them all out there by the trillions and
[1:27:49] called them all by name
[1:27:50] you're not star 1 star 2 star 3 star 4
[1:27:53] he gave him everyone a name that's the
[1:27:55] greatness of our God
[1:27:56] oh man is so small and so cheery and so
[1:28:02] little of his homeworld
[1:28:05] he spoke believe it or not it's still
[1:28:09] expanding in the belt of Orion the three
[1:28:14] stars by which reflect the Pyramids of
[1:28:16] Giza on the earth mom I'm getting into
[1:28:18] the weekend what am I doing here but the
[1:28:20] belt of Orion Braun which reflects
[1:28:22] itself and the Pyramids of Giza is a
[1:28:25] nebula a nebula three of their stars are
[1:28:31] being born while we're here tonight and
[1:28:39] the universe is still expanding it's
[1:28:42] still growing and going glory to God
[1:28:50] surely he didn't take care of us oh by
[1:28:59] his own will he begat us with the word
[1:29:05] of truth the instrumentality of truth
[1:29:09] was not a mere creative act but the
[1:29:14] projection of God's own divine nature
[1:29:17] the truths that's who he is
[1:29:20] why Jesus could say I am the way the
[1:29:24] truth and the life we are children of
[1:29:28] truth we love truth notice in Romans
[1:29:35] 2:15 let me find a place to stop here
[1:29:38] which show the work of the law written
[1:29:40] in the heart speaking of the Gentiles
[1:29:42] their conscience also bearing witness
[1:29:44] and their thoughts the mean while
[1:29:46] accusing or else excusing one another in
[1:29:50] the day when God shall judge the secrets
[1:29:54] of men by Jesus Christ according what so
[1:30:05] I ask you did the New Testament Saints
[1:30:08] have the choice to bypass the teaching
[1:30:12] of the Apostles and go around them and
[1:30:14] go straight to Jesus I don't need you
[1:30:18] Paul I don't need you Peter only none of
[1:30:20] you I'll get it myself
[1:30:23] I'll go to Jesus himself not according
[1:30:27] to them as you did what in the world
[1:30:30] would embolden this man that he would
[1:30:32] claim this gospel for the Howard he said
[1:30:36] my gospel so guess what if you got born
[1:30:42] again you come through the gospel of
[1:30:45] these men
[1:30:46] I don't need that I'm going straight to
[1:30:49] Jesus Jesus come through these men they
[1:30:53] get mad pal do whatever you want to do
[1:30:55] but that's exactly what the word says
[1:30:56] Romans 16:25 now under him that is a
[1:30:59] power to establish you according you
[1:31:07] mean God was establishing New Testament
[1:31:10] Saints according to the gospel of Paul
[1:31:17] now listen to me carefully Paul preached
[1:31:22] what Jesus preached but Jesus didn't
[1:31:25] preach everything Paul preached because
[1:31:28] it wasn't time
[1:31:31] Jesus spoken a little bit about the new
[1:31:34] verse in Saint John 3 spoke about the
[1:31:36] Holy Ghost in st. John 14:6 I'm 15 st.
[1:31:38] John 17 Saints on 16 but whenever it
[1:31:41] really come to explaining it Paul was
[1:31:43] given the permission by God to express
[1:31:45] through Christ the logos and the Rhema
[1:31:47] that was Jesus in his humanity on the
[1:31:50] earth could not say why he was going to
[1:31:54] do it through the church can you imagine
[1:31:56] the king himself but instead of saying
[1:31:59] it he said I want to that Peter sit this
[1:32:01] way and I want to let Paul sit that way
[1:32:03] and I'm gonna let James set that way
[1:32:06] and I want to Oliver but they're going
[1:32:07] to say the same thing but their gifts
[1:32:09] will be diverse but it'll be me and them
[1:32:11] Oh glory to God I choose to do it this
[1:32:15] way and if you're gonna be saved you
[1:32:17] gotta believe these guys
[1:32:25] and let me close with this person now to
[1:32:31] him that is of power to us to stablish
[1:32:34] you according to my gospel and the
[1:32:38] preaching of Jesus Christ according to
[1:32:42] the revelation of the mystery which has
[1:32:45] kept secret since the world began
[1:32:52] 2nd Timothy 2:8 remember that Jesus
[1:32:55] Christ of the seed of David was raised
[1:32:58] from the dead according to my gospel or
[1:33:12] rabito God
[1:33:13] so could you get to Christ now and fifty
[1:33:17] five a days sixty to eighty sixty one
[1:33:20] and this is being said I don't need to
[1:33:22] go to church I don't need them all
[1:33:24] apostles after one of the acts of
[1:33:26] crossing myself a marine nobody not
[1:33:29] according to what these men talked and
[1:33:31] this is apostolic
[1:33:34] [Applause]
[1:33:42] praise God praise God
[1:33:49] so you believe Paul preached what Jesus
[1:33:52] preached Jesus didn't preach everything
[1:33:54] pomfret because it wasn't time we
[1:33:57] preached what Luther preached plus
[1:34:00] Wesley plus Pentecost well praise the
[1:34:06] Lord you got to keep adding the plus
[1:34:08] sister God stops and then we all get
[1:34:09] equal and then we leave
[1:34:11] Luther Plus Leslie puts the truth the
[1:34:13] Pentecost then Malachi 4 produces a
[1:34:16] rapture I'm saying it out loud saying
[1:34:19] then you'll never go on the rapture
[1:34:20] because you've left out a bunch of
[1:34:21] pluses which makes you a - oh my
[1:34:26] Sofer gonna go in the rapture how will
[1:34:28] we go our rapture gospel loser didn't
[1:34:32] preach arrest for extra gospel nor did
[1:34:34] Wesley nor the Pentecost took Haley
[1:34:37] easier to bring that to Rebekah then
[1:34:41] those who are faithfully taught go out
[1:34:43] from underneath that rapture ministry
[1:34:45] and say what he said not play what he
[1:34:48] said but say what he said tell me how
[1:34:52] can I say what the tapes say if I don't
[1:34:55] say what the tape said he didn't say
[1:34:57] play what the tapes play but say what
[1:34:59] the tapes say the fivefold ministry is
[1:35:04] not playing stop fast-forward rewind and
[1:35:07] pause we'll come on church it's apostles
[1:35:16] prophets evangelists pastors teachers
[1:35:21] you said well we're preaching tonight
[1:35:23] they're preaching down a nicaragua
[1:35:25] brother dare on the brother Linz in
[1:35:27] those brothers down there
[1:35:28] hey man people making all the calls I
[1:35:31] sniper though don't tell me people come
[1:35:33] into the Lord people accepting the Lord
[1:35:35] how through the gospel of this day
[1:35:38] we preach what Paul preached but brother
[1:35:42] madam also preach things Paul didn't
[1:35:44] preach I came here in there can you Wow
[1:35:48] you're understanding that right you see
[1:35:51] Paul never preached the seven seals
[1:35:53] wasn't give to it Peter never preached
[1:35:56] you understand the book of Revelation
[1:35:58] when it was written Paul was already
[1:36:00] dead
[1:36:00] Peter was already dead most of the
[1:36:04] Apostles are already dead they may not
[1:36:06] have even ever heard the term seven
[1:36:09] thunders or seven seals then were
[1:36:11] already gone with each other it was not
[1:36:14] their allocation of the word and John
[1:36:18] solid in vision but couldn't preach it
[1:36:22] but he said see left to the end time
[1:36:25] then the days of the voice of the
[1:36:28] seventh angel and he shall begin to
[1:36:31] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:36:33] finished oh praise be to God aren't you
[1:36:36] glad to be living in this day oh thank
[1:36:40] you lord
[1:36:46] raise bottom
[1:36:48] Thank You Lord if I lived in the first
[1:36:53] century my name would have been in the
[1:36:55] New Testament

[1:37:00] preachers that's right I would have been
[1:37:04] y'all would have been a church in the
[1:37:06] first century

[1:37:10] you lived in cost you lived and let us
[1:37:12] say you lived in Ephesus but God chose
[1:37:17] to let you live in this day well you say
[1:37:23] they no book been written about us
[1:37:25] there's more books written about us and
[1:37:27] there was written about them they're not
[1:37:29] all good but they've all been written
[1:37:30] about us for sure we are the fulfillment
[1:37:32] they long to see this time Paul knew it
[1:37:37] would come Abraham knew it would come
[1:37:39] Laura took neither her brother mem say
[1:37:40] yesterday Peter longed to see this day
[1:37:42] Abraham longed to see this day the
[1:37:44] Apostles longed to see this day
[1:37:46] and we see it definitely father think
