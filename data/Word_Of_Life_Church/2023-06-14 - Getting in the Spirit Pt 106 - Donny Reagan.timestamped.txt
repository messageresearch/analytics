[44:57] when you have a hard time serving a God
[44:59] that your wife was in their wiping the
[45:01] furniture off one day and she knocked
[45:03] your God off from the floor and broke

[45:20] in the house of God
[45:22] we're going to pray I wonder how many he
[45:23] has a need to request on your heart
[45:25] tonight
[45:26] also I'd like to mention to you about
[45:28] Eric I know that you've been praying for
[45:30] and she's been running a fever since
[45:33] Sunday and they had to give her two
[45:35] units of platelets and still running a
[45:38] fever got up to a little over 102.
[45:40] they've done all kinds of tests trying
[45:42] to find it couldn't find it until this
[45:45] morning I did another test and then this
[45:47] afternoon I got the result of that test
[45:49] and it was MRSA many of you know what
[45:52] MRSA is and they called it a superbug
[45:56] I just kind of laughed and I read that
[45:58] meaning because I thought what's a Super
[46:00] Bug compared to a super god
[46:03] and a super church and a super race and
[46:05] a super hour that we're living in
[46:09] so thank the Lord they finally got her
[46:11] in a room this evening right before we
[46:13] came to church so we want you to be
[46:14] remembering her if you will then the
[46:16] Lord will just move forward and give the
[46:19] doctors wisdom to be able to know how to
[46:21] how to deal with it when sister Donna of
[46:24] Suson sent this testimony about brother
[46:26] Homer to Carol before church I told her
[46:29] I said Senator Erica that'll be an
[46:31] encouragement to her so she sent it to
[46:33] her and said you may be next
[46:35] praise the lord well that's what we're
[46:37] waiting for isn't it
[46:39] and your name
[46:43] praise the Lord
[46:45] so we're not just concerned about Erica
[46:47] of course I'm not just concerned about
[46:48] brother Homer we're concerned about your
[46:50] needs and your children and whatever
[46:52] that you have need of in your life
[46:54] so let's approach him tonight and ask
[46:56] him to help us as we look into the word
[46:58] as well
[46:59] Heavenly Father we're so thankful to you
[47:02] that we could be here in this place once
[47:04] again Lord Jesus we just love you so

[47:15] you've told us to Lord you even told us
[47:18] by the mouth of your Prophet to ask for
[47:21] great things and many of them so we
[47:25] don't feel like that we're wearing you
[47:27] out by constantly bringing our needs and
[47:30] the closer we get to the end of the way
[47:31] it seems like the more needs and
[47:33] requests that we have
[47:35] but it also gives us opportunities to
[47:38] believe you for the supernatural
[47:40] we've seen you do so much Among Us it
[47:43] would be a sin for us to disbelief
[47:46] so we're asking tonight in the name of
[47:49] Jesus that should move for the needs of
[47:51] your children
[47:52] we thank you so much for that testimony
[47:55] about brother Homer Lord God thank you
[47:57] Father Lord we're just so grateful and
[48:00] appreciative that you move for our
[48:02] brother we're just thanking you for it
[48:04] right now Lord Jesus
[48:06] we'll just give you praise now Lord we
[48:08] have these other needs and requests that
[48:10] are unanswered yet
[48:12] but faith says there are already ours so
[48:16] we claim it we believe it as if though
[48:19] they're in our possession now we're
[48:21] asking Lord that you'll be mindful of
[48:22] Erica we're asking Lord that you be
[48:24] mindful of all the needs and the
[48:26] requests of your children that had a
[48:28] hand uplifted those that were streaming
[48:31] the service and many many needs and
[48:33] desires we pray father that you would
[48:35] just help us or that we can believe with
[48:38] all of our hearts now as we Endeavor to
[48:41] look into your word I pray that you
[48:43] should help me move me aside Lord that I
[48:45] can be able to just be an instrument is
[48:47] it we're a microphone that you can take
[48:49] in your hands and speak the words of
[48:52] Life Through Me in Jesus name amen
[48:56] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11.
[49:00] while you're turning that I want to say
[49:02] this to you before we read
[49:05] I have desired
[49:07] to eat this supper
[49:10] with you
[49:14] I have desired
[49:16] to eat this supper with you
[49:20] I've had this in preparation for several
[49:24] weeks and I had brother Daryl to speak
[49:27] of course a member of the Aaron it's
[49:28] been Wednesday night that I wasn't here
[49:30] going to brother David's and
[49:33] I said something that's been on my heart
[49:36] and I believe that it'll be a benefit to
[49:39] us you say why'd you call that supper
[49:41] well it's the bride's supper we feed on
[49:43] the unfailing body word of the son of
[49:45] man
[49:46] we realize why everybody can feed on
[49:49] this message it makes them sick at their
[49:50] stomach
[49:51] but it's right exactly what we need
[49:56] now let's let's read for a foundation
[49:58] from the master builder Paul
[50:03] First Corinthians 3 11. for other
[50:06] Foundation can no man lay then that is
[50:08] laid which is Jesus Christ
[50:11] now if any man build upon this
[50:13] Foundation gold silver precious stones
[50:17] wood hay stubble
[50:20] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[50:23] for the day shall declare it the day
[50:27] shall declare it because it shall be
[50:30] revealed by fire
[50:32] and the fire shall try every man's work
[50:36] of what sort it is now remember the
[50:40] Bible for the most part is written in
[50:43] the masculine gender now I know that
[50:46] that is so upsetting to the age that
[50:50] we're living
[50:51] but this is my reply to you get over it
[51:02] we don't have a queen James Bible we
[51:05] have a King James
[51:07] and our Bible is written in pronouns and
[51:09] if they don't like it
[51:11] lump it
[51:13] I don't care
[51:15] I've already woke
[51:18] in the resurrection that's why I'm not
[51:21] part of the woke
[51:23] because I've already woke up
[51:27] praise the Lord
[51:31] so every man
[51:33] is not just the masculine gender of
[51:35] course at all but it's men and women
[51:38] boys and girls
[51:40] listen in verse 14 and if any man's word
[51:43] abide
[51:45] which he has built thereon he shall
[51:48] receive a reward
[51:50] if any man's work shall be burned he
[51:54] shall suffer loss
[51:57] but he himself shall be saved yet so as
[52:03] by far
[52:05] so works and salvation are two different
[52:07] things and God bless his words you may
[52:10] be seated
[52:14] how many believes it works are important
[52:17] what you do for God what you do for
[52:19] others how you serve the Lord
[52:23] I realized that because of this Grace
[52:25] where that people so talk about Grace
[52:29] many of them don't even understand it
[52:31] anyway but they have so abused the word
[52:35] grace and when you talk about works and
[52:38] things that you've got to do many people
[52:40] don't even like to go that way because
[52:43] they get it confused in their mind what
[52:46] if I have to do anything that that makes
[52:48] the cross of not a fact no it's two
[52:50] separate things you see grace is what he
[52:53] did for me works is what I do for him
[52:56] so there's nothing we can ever do to be
[53:00] able to buy our Salvation to buy a
[53:04] ticket to Heaven there's nothing we can
[53:06] ever do never accumulate enough goodness
[53:09] enough works enough things so where we
[53:12] could ever repay him God is not doing a
[53:15] loan service to where God's going to
[53:18] loan us salvation and then God's going
[53:20] to charge us so much interest and then
[53:22] we pay the loan back it is a gift to you
[53:25] you'll never have to pay back for your
[53:29] salvation
[53:30] but that does not exclude works that we
[53:34] do and those Works can include so many
[53:38] things now for some it will be what they
[53:41] will do for other people it will be what
[53:44] they do for the church it will be what
[53:47] they do for the work of God in the sense
[53:49] of monetary some will never have a lot
[53:52] of money or they would be able to
[53:54] support books printing books building
[53:57] churches buying Bibles they would just
[53:59] never be able to do that but maybe they
[54:02] would be able to help someone that would
[54:04] be sick and they would think well maybe
[54:07] I could help prepare their family a meal
[54:10] maybe I would be able to do something
[54:13] like that it would be so small it
[54:15] wouldn't be small if they don't have any
[54:17] other means it's a big thing so the
[54:20] thing I've found in studying about works
[54:22] is that works are as different as the
[54:25] people who will do them and one of the
[54:28] worst things we can do is to try to to
[54:30] make people our example and say well I
[54:33] like what brother Dave did I think I'll
[54:35] try that not what you need to do is ask
[54:38] God God what do you want me to do what
[54:41] have you put in my hands and what have
[54:43] you made me able to do I love the way
[54:46] that brother Branham deals with the
[54:48] Simplicity even of the Gospel calls and
[54:51] how the God would deal with people when
[54:53] they ask him in question answers about
[54:54] people knowing their position and what
[54:57] they're called to do and he said well
[54:59] what I do he said I look at the person
[55:02] and I see what they're claiming they're
[55:05] called to be and then I look at that
[55:08] individual and see if they have what
[55:11] they say they claim they're called to do
[55:14] because he said God will work with his
[55:17] creature in the way that he made him now
[55:21] he said say that a man says that he's
[55:23] called to be a pastor and yet that man
[55:25] is a flighty type of a person he said
[55:28] God will never make a man and like that
[55:31] a pastor so his very makeup and his gift
[55:35] testifies against the call that he
[55:39] claims that he has so a person that
[55:42] claims are called to do this and that
[55:44] and the other Whatever It Is God will
[55:46] gift each of us in what we claim we're
[55:50] called to do so if a person tries and
[55:53] they try and they try and they try and
[55:56] they can never succeed and what they
[55:59] think God has called them to do it's
[56:02] probably a good chance they're not
[56:04] called to do what they think they're
[56:06] called to do so more than likely they're
[56:09] called to do something else but it may
[56:12] not be exactly their choice to do it oh
[56:15] you see there's the problem because a
[56:18] lot of times we have our own choice of
[56:21] what we want to do and it's not always
[56:23] what God wants us to do but God will
[56:27] gift us and make us in such a way that
[56:30] it will be complementary to the type of
[56:33] call that we have now you watch a man
[56:36] and whenever that man claims he's called
[56:38] to be an evangelist he's called to
[56:41] travel around the world and you watch
[56:43] him whenever he Parks his car at the med
[56:46] center and he goes in to pray for
[56:48] somebody he comes out he goes to the
[56:51] entire parking lot blowing everybody's
[56:54] horn trying to find exactly where his
[56:57] car is he has no sense of direction more
[57:00] than likely he's not an evangelist
[57:02] why he don't know his way around
[57:05] he can't get nowhere so he you know God
[57:08] gives an individual and the way they're
[57:11] called to do it oh people say well I'm
[57:12] called to do this for God and I'm called
[57:15] but it's killing me that don't make no
[57:17] sense to me if God has called you to do
[57:20] something and you're always so beat down
[57:23] with what God has called you to do it's
[57:25] probably time you need to re-look at
[57:27] your calling not saying your load won't
[57:29] get heavy and it will not be difficult
[57:31] but it makes no sense to me that God
[57:33] calls us to do something and drives us
[57:36] crazy batty while we're doing it I mean
[57:39] that don't even make any sense to me
[57:40] because of you God will call us and God
[57:43] will equip us and what it will do is it
[57:46] will make the common people around you
[57:48] be mesmerized by the way God has called
[57:51] you that within itself is a testimony
[57:54] that you are called because they have a
[57:56] little bit of an inclination as far as
[57:58] what you deal with and they have a
[58:00] little bit of insight of the burden that
[58:02] you bear and yet they see you dealing
[58:04] with they say how on the world does she
[58:06] do that how in the world does he do that
[58:09] well it's because they're called and
[58:11] they're gifted to do it now each of our
[58:14] works when we stand before God and I
[58:16] don't want you to think now tonight
[58:18] that I'm just speaking to the adults and
[58:21] our church only because every one of our
[58:25] young people are going to stand before
[58:27] the Lord Jesus
[58:29] and you're not going to stand there with
[58:31] your mom and daddy you're not going to
[58:33] stand out with your youth leader you're
[58:35] not even going to stand there with your
[58:37] pastor and we will all stand there as a
[58:40] group and then the Lord will call our
[58:42] name all right Word of Life Church
[58:44] everyone that attended come forward
[58:48] I'm going to reward you all at one time
[58:52] it will be an individual
[58:54] now every young person sitting here
[58:57] tonight you do not need to squander your
[59:00] use you do not need to waste your use
[59:03] but you need to go to God while you're a
[59:07] young man or a young woman and find out
[59:10] now God what do you want me to be
[59:14] I have no regrets but brother Donnie you
[59:16] will you give so much of your years to
[59:18] God I only wish I could have give more
[59:20] give my heart to him when I was 12.
[59:22] started preaching when I was 18. ask me
[59:24] if I have any regrets I'll answer you
[59:26] before you do not one the only regret
[59:29] I've got is I've failed him so many
[59:31] times along the way I do not regret
[59:33] giving God my teens my twenties my
[59:36] thirties my forties my fifties and the
[59:38] better part of my 60s and if I have 70s
[59:41] I'm going to give him that too but I'm
[59:43] so glad that I did not waste my teens
[59:46] and my 20s and my 30s and my 40s and
[59:49] then God finally get through my thick
[59:51] head that I was called to preach and
[59:54] then may start out in my 50s can you
[59:56] imagine how much time but I would have
[59:58] wasted can you imagine how many years
[1:00:00] brother Tim Pruitt would have wasted if
[1:00:03] he would have waited till he become 40
[1:00:05] or 50 years old and should have started
[1:00:07] preaching when he was a teenager I'm so
[1:00:10] grateful that God has got people that
[1:00:12] realize you don't have to wait to be a
[1:00:15] 50 year old man or a 40 year old woman
[1:00:18] before you can find what God wants you
[1:00:21] to do
[1:00:22] works are something that the Lamb of God
[1:00:25] will reward each of us for now remember
[1:00:28] works and reward coincide together not
[1:00:32] salvation Salvation is set totally alone
[1:00:35] and this is why that a person actually
[1:00:38] that are saved and there will no doubt
[1:00:41] be millions of them that will fall in
[1:00:44] that category and their Works will be
[1:00:46] burned they will have no record
[1:00:48] whatsoever that they've hardly done
[1:00:50] anything for God because what they did
[1:00:53] they built upon the foundation Jesus
[1:00:56] Christ a denominational image that was
[1:00:59] not even true they built upon it an
[1:01:02] image of stubble an image of wood an
[1:01:05] image of hay but it was not the
[1:01:08] apostolic image of what the original
[1:01:11] Doctrine from the apostles so they stand
[1:01:13] before God and the fire will try their
[1:01:16] work and they baptize all these people
[1:01:19] and titles every bit of will be burned
[1:01:22] up they spent years in seminary the
[1:01:25] whole thing be consumed they was loyal
[1:01:28] to a denomination yet many of them will
[1:01:31] be saved not bragged but saved as by
[1:01:35] fire purging time trying time this is
[1:01:39] why the foolish Virgin Goes Through the
[1:01:41] tribulation period to be purged remember
[1:01:44] that in the seventh seal page 575 or
[1:01:46] silver three full purpose of the six
[1:01:49] seal three-fold purpose of the seven
[1:01:50] seal and it was The Sixth Seal was to
[1:01:53] purge the Earth to purge the foolish
[1:01:55] virgin and to purge 144 000. the reason
[1:01:59] the bride does not go through that time
[1:02:01] is because she's purged under the
[1:02:04] fullness of the atonement of Jesus
[1:02:06] Christ and she accepted not only what he
[1:02:09] done on Calvary but she's fully
[1:02:12] accepting what he's doing right here
[1:02:14] tonight
[1:02:15] which is the unfolding of his mystery
[1:02:17] but works are totally different than a
[1:02:20] person being saved now lot was a saved
[1:02:24] man y'all agree with that God saved him
[1:02:26] sent the Angels down there they drug him
[1:02:28] out he was saved but what kind of reward
[1:02:31] did he get wind up sleeping with his
[1:02:33] daughters having children by them and of
[1:02:37] course there was nothing but a thorn and
[1:02:39] the side to Abraham's seed for all of
[1:02:42] those years nothing but a sworn and yet
[1:02:45] we realized was a lot bright he was not
[1:02:48] he was a penny and Abraham of course
[1:02:51] excelled a hundred times over beyond
[1:02:53] what lot could ever do but God saved the
[1:02:57] man so be careful whenever you
[1:02:58] condemning some of these people out here
[1:03:00] because only God knows really wherever
[1:03:02] one of them will stand
[1:03:04] so if I ask you I'd be good to him
[1:03:06] because if I'd be the only goodness ever
[1:03:07] really see with me in Titus Chapter 3
[1:03:11] Verse 8. this is a faithful saying and
[1:03:14] these things I will that thou affirm
[1:03:17] constantly that they which have believed
[1:03:20] in God might be careful to maintain
[1:03:26] careful to maintain good works now
[1:03:30] here's a man who preached Grace like
[1:03:33] none of the rest of the Apostles in the
[1:03:35] New Testament but this man also wanted
[1:03:38] the church to be adorned with good works
[1:03:41] he didn't just want them to start with
[1:03:43] good works but he wanted them to
[1:03:45] maintain good works listen to this which
[1:03:49] I believed in God might be careful so he
[1:03:52] wanted them to be careful so they didn't
[1:03:54] just start out doing good works and that
[1:03:56] they become slack and say well you know
[1:03:58] I don't know what to do I don't know
[1:04:00] what I can do I I just try to go to
[1:04:02] church and live my own life and just
[1:04:04] mind my own business and stay away from
[1:04:06] everybody else that's the exact opposite
[1:04:09] of what the gospel calls us to do
[1:04:12] now notice what what the word you're
[1:04:14] good I found this is amazing as I was
[1:04:16] looking at this good it's beautiful
[1:04:18] handsome excellent imminent Choice
[1:04:21] precious useful suitable commendable
[1:04:25] admirable excellent in its nature and
[1:04:29] characteristics that's what he uses to
[1:04:33] destroy describe rather works so he
[1:04:36] wants us to maintain things that are
[1:04:39] beautiful things that are handsome
[1:04:41] things that have attributes that testify
[1:04:44] of the goodness of God let me just say
[1:04:47] what a brother Donnie how am I going to
[1:04:48] know well this is what you can do you
[1:04:51] can judge the works that you do judge
[1:04:54] the treatment that you give to everybody
[1:04:57] Sinners Saints what you think of bride
[1:05:00] what you think are foolish virgin or
[1:05:02] however you want to categorize them and
[1:05:04] then run those Works through this
[1:05:07] description and see if it describes it
[1:05:10] as beautiful and good good and handsome
[1:05:13] and attractive to God's Divine Purpose
[1:05:16] judge your attitude toward those you go
[1:05:19] to church with well somebody's going to
[1:05:21] say Amen or just look at me
[1:05:23] now notice he said that we might be
[1:05:26] careful to maintain good works these
[1:05:29] things are good and profitable unto man
[1:05:32] now notice he jumps down from that verse
[1:05:35] down to verse 14. he apparently wants
[1:05:37] them and us to be able to get this let
[1:05:40] ours also learn to maintain good works
[1:05:45] why in the world would he repeat this
[1:05:47] word for word again now I want you to
[1:05:50] notice the way that he puts this in here
[1:05:52] that it's not something that the Holy
[1:05:55] Ghost will automatically rain down on
[1:05:58] the people and once you get the Holy
[1:06:01] Ghost that works are just automatically
[1:06:04] rained down on your life and you never
[1:06:06] have to put forth any effort but notice
[1:06:08] the word that he used here that let ours
[1:06:11] also learn
[1:06:13] so how you going to learn how you're
[1:06:15] going to learn by being preached to
[1:06:16] you're going to learn by reading you're
[1:06:18] going to be learning by listening to
[1:06:20] tapes going to Bible study going to use
[1:06:22] meeting someone like that so that we can
[1:06:25] learn to maintain good works how many
[1:06:28] wants to maintain good works
[1:06:30] now this is the way we do it let ours
[1:06:33] also learn to maintain good works for
[1:06:37] necessary uses that they be not
[1:06:41] unfruitful so I want you to notice now
[1:06:43] that Paul links on fruitfulness was not
[1:06:47] very many good works so there again
[1:06:49] don't just think now that I'm preaching
[1:06:51] to the adults and those that's 30 and
[1:06:53] above but I want every one of you young
[1:06:56] people that are here tonight I want you
[1:06:58] to sing as well about the works that you
[1:07:02] do and how you treat your fellow young
[1:07:05] people and how that whenever you go to a
[1:07:08] youth camp that you are representing me
[1:07:11] you are representing our church you are
[1:07:14] representing first and foremost the Lord
[1:07:16] Jesus himself your treatment there your
[1:07:20] treatment here your treatment when you
[1:07:22] go to school your treatment on the job
[1:07:25] your treatment even when you're playing
[1:07:27] ball over here or when you're in the
[1:07:29] music room whatever you do doing there
[1:07:32] is a record book I went to God that
[1:07:34] every one of us would realize that there
[1:07:36] is what the Old Testament calls a book
[1:07:39] of remembrance that is being written so
[1:07:43] our attitudes our Behavior our treatment
[1:07:46] of one another the things that we say
[1:07:48] about one another behind one another's
[1:07:50] backs uh oh I can see this is going to
[1:07:53] be one of them Services where amens is
[1:07:55] going to be like hence teeth and as you
[1:07:58] know hens don't have no teeth so I'm
[1:08:00] hoping y'all ain't a bunch of hens here
[1:08:02] tonight I hope there's at least three or
[1:08:04] four Eagles
[1:08:06] okay at least heifer doesn't all right
[1:08:08] praise the Lord I'm preach them so you
[1:08:10] know it is something that God wants us
[1:08:13] to realize so in when our book of
[1:08:16] remembrance is opened up before the Lord
[1:08:18] now it's not your salvation but it is
[1:08:21] the book that God is going to reward you
[1:08:24] brother bear going to reward you brother
[1:08:27] Rob going to reward you by the keys so
[1:08:30] it will not be well I believe I believe
[1:08:32] I believe you suffer not careful we will
[1:08:35] think saying that covers absolutely
[1:08:38] everything but here was a man who who
[1:08:41] preached belief which is the Greek word
[1:08:44] pistus that's the word that it comes
[1:08:46] from and another word from that pistol
[1:08:48] law but it was all about belief
[1:08:50] believing but yet he also taught that
[1:08:54] there was works that must be done and
[1:08:57] The Works would not just start when you
[1:08:59] got saved but they must be maintained
[1:09:01] I'm as familiar with the word maintained
[1:09:03] it's where we get the word maintenance
[1:09:05] from so like you're buying a car and
[1:09:08] then you get your little manual out most
[1:09:09] of us don't even read that thing we
[1:09:11] thought in the back of the car and
[1:09:12] forget it but our little light built
[1:09:14] inside of our car it will tell us when
[1:09:17] it's time to get an oil change now you
[1:09:18] can override that if you want to and
[1:09:20] keep on driving that thing for another
[1:09:22] 40 000 miles on that oil if it makes it
[1:09:25] that far but it's up to you if you wish
[1:09:28] to waste your money for that then go
[1:09:29] ahead and do it but I can tell you
[1:09:31] what's going to happen to your rods and
[1:09:32] your pistons and your crankshaft that
[1:09:35] sludge were built up inside of there and
[1:09:37] over time than rod bearings they're
[1:09:38] going to start building up grit and all
[1:09:41] kinds of things around there every time
[1:09:42] you start your engine and drive that car
[1:09:44] to Walmart you're just like taking
[1:09:46] abrasive substance on the inside of your
[1:09:48] crankshaft and it's going to just keep
[1:09:50] right on the hone in that little crank
[1:09:52] of yours right away or you can take it
[1:09:54] down to Jiffy Lube or somewhere else and
[1:09:56] get maintenance done you see this is
[1:09:59] what the layer to see and Christians
[1:10:01] don't like they don't like Jiffy Lube
[1:10:03] preachers
[1:10:04] oh no they want preachers to just they
[1:10:07] want polished preachers they want
[1:10:09] buffing preachers but buff me real light
[1:10:11] now buddy buff me real life just give me
[1:10:13] a little massage would you I'm going to
[1:10:16] drag out the 80 grit tonight
[1:10:19] if any of us got any rust I'm going to
[1:10:22] take it down to the bone if you've got
[1:10:24] any debris and any buildup I'm dragging
[1:10:27] out the buffing pool I'm dragging out
[1:10:29] the big grinder
[1:10:31] well grind me Lord if I need grinding
[1:10:34] that's the way I look at it
[1:10:36] but you see it requires maintenance and
[1:10:39] we know that way our our building here
[1:10:41] our conditions I'm sure you've seen this
[1:10:43] gigantic units that we've got here we've
[1:10:46] got a maintenance contract so they can
[1:10:48] come in and check it and check the free
[1:10:50] on and check this and check that what's
[1:10:52] that going to do it's going to save us
[1:10:54] in the long run so they'll be able to
[1:10:56] tell us you need this you need to do
[1:10:58] that every so many hours or whatever and
[1:11:00] it's the same way with Christians it
[1:11:02] does US good to be able to look back and
[1:11:05] say okay so what am I doing what am I
[1:11:07] doing with my life what am I doing
[1:11:10] what's my time and you may not realize
[1:11:12] it now but you real as you get older one
[1:11:14] of the most precious things that you
[1:11:16] have is time
[1:11:18] time oh yeah the older you get the more
[1:11:21] you realize you've wasted a lot of it
[1:11:22] too but the older you get it's like
[1:11:24] you're saying okay Lord what can I do
[1:11:26] it's what time I have left I want to
[1:11:28] delegate that time I've got a family
[1:11:30] I've got a wife I've got children I've
[1:11:31] got grandchildren I've got this and that
[1:11:33] and the other and I'm only one man I've
[1:11:35] only got 24 hours in the day I can only
[1:11:37] do 3 million 985 332 things in one day
[1:11:41] but it seems like I need to do 13
[1:11:43] million 975 318 things in one day and
[1:11:47] when I lay down at night sometimes my
[1:11:49] mind is still trying to catch up anybody
[1:11:51] else on the same page you say how in the
[1:11:53] world can you do it and if we're not
[1:11:55] careful we'll get so busy with life and
[1:11:57] so busy with things that do not have
[1:12:00] eternal value at all and we will let
[1:12:03] those things which are really the most
[1:12:05] important will put them off prayer
[1:12:07] reading our Bible ministering to the
[1:12:09] saints of God taking time to pick up
[1:12:11] your phone and just text somebody hey I
[1:12:13] was thinking about you how you doing
[1:12:15] today I just want you to know I'm
[1:12:16] praying for you you realize that text
[1:12:19] might change somebody's life that text
[1:12:22] might actually transform somebody's life
[1:12:24] to let them know that Jesus put them on
[1:12:27] your heart that will do a whole lot more
[1:12:29] good don't get mad at me now then you
[1:12:31] standing out there on the course and
[1:12:33] you're trying to do a little part of
[1:12:34] this and part of that and power
[1:12:36] something else and you're trying to do a
[1:12:38] hole in one I can give you a good hole
[1:12:40] in one obey the Holy Ghost that's a hole
[1:12:42] in one every time that'll absolutely
[1:12:45] transform people's lives
[1:12:48] now notice that Paul goes on now in
[1:12:51] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 24 and I find
[1:12:54] this so astounding it's a very unusual
[1:12:56] uh word play that he uses here he said
[1:12:59] let us consider one another let us
[1:13:02] consider one another now friend this is
[1:13:05] why you've heard me preach against you
[1:13:07] for years and years why did this move
[1:13:09] among the message is that people just
[1:13:12] stay home and they don't go to church
[1:13:13] and they don't fellowship and they don't
[1:13:15] be around the saints of God tell me
[1:13:17] please how you're going to fulfill this
[1:13:19] verse
[1:13:20] let us consider one another and I want
[1:13:24] you to notice he's not advising them now
[1:13:26] to be a busybody and to have your nose
[1:13:29] stuck in everybody else's business but
[1:13:32] he's saying that they should be
[1:13:34] interested in one another if you see and
[1:13:37] notice that somebody hasn't been in
[1:13:39] church for a service or two or sometimes
[1:13:42] we go on a trip and we're gone but you
[1:13:45] know what it shouldn't just be the
[1:13:46] Deacon's responsibility or my
[1:13:48] responsibility to stand up here for the
[1:13:50] first 15 minutes and try to go through
[1:13:53] the role and count okay to see somebody
[1:13:54] who's normally sits right there uh
[1:13:57] brother uh somebody help me I knew
[1:13:59] that's over there that shouldn't just be
[1:14:00] my place but if you're used to sitting
[1:14:03] by them and you've noticed you know what
[1:14:04] they've not been to church in a service
[1:14:06] or do I think I'm just going to call
[1:14:07] them hey you doing okay just why I
[1:14:10] missed you in church you you'd never
[1:14:12] know sometimes what that does to
[1:14:15] somebody to encourage them well brother
[1:14:17] Donnie that's the Deacon's face and word
[1:14:19] the message say that
[1:14:22] yeah the Bible tells you
[1:14:28] let us consider
[1:14:31] let us consider one another
[1:14:35] let us consider one another you see
[1:14:39] we're not we're not intended as children
[1:14:41] of God to be selfish and so
[1:14:45] self-centered and about us and our
[1:14:47] family and I my ideas in my mind me and
[1:14:50] mine God never made us that way what if
[1:14:53] your hand took that idea
[1:14:55] what if your hand your right hand
[1:14:57] developed that selfish idea tonight
[1:15:00] and it decides it is sick and tired of
[1:15:05] being attached to that right horn
[1:15:07] second
[1:15:08] I am so fed up my whole life I've been
[1:15:12] on this right arm I've never got to be
[1:15:14] the head I've never got to go to the
[1:15:16] belly I wish I'd done out to belly all
[1:15:18] my when you be strange looking if you
[1:15:20] had a hand right there
[1:15:21] brother Homer Longoria said he wished
[1:15:23] his mouth was right here that way he
[1:15:24] could sit right at the table and just
[1:15:26] pull it right into his mouth
[1:15:29] but he'd be very strange looking fellow
[1:15:31] wouldn't he
[1:15:32] so what if your arm or your fingers or
[1:15:36] something said you know what I'm tired
[1:15:37] of this I've never got to move around in
[1:15:40] the body I've never got to explore I
[1:15:43] don't even know anything else about the
[1:15:44] body I've been here my whole life I'm
[1:15:47] glad you've been there little fella and
[1:15:49] I'm really glad you've been there boy
[1:15:51] you ever get a cut on that finger or
[1:15:52] that thumb and it's right there in the
[1:15:54] Main Avenue you use that thing every day
[1:15:56] and you don't even realize how much you
[1:15:59] use that thing until you touch that sore
[1:16:01] place I'll tell you that's why they've
[1:16:03] got a lot of the message we've got a lot
[1:16:04] of Sword placed Christians oh oh
[1:16:07] what you mean oh
[1:16:09] the fetus oh
[1:16:13] okay well I guess you're attended the
[1:16:14] wrong service because I didn't bring
[1:16:16] Band-Aids I brought a machete
[1:16:20] help us Lord that's exactly right but
[1:16:23] notice Paul
[1:16:24] the body
[1:16:25] have a consideration of each other what
[1:16:28] is it it's a mutual consideration you
[1:16:31] young people
[1:16:32] you realize what you ought to be to each
[1:16:35] other
[1:16:36] you should not be a thorn in each
[1:16:38] other's side
[1:16:40] but you should want to watch for your
[1:16:42] young brothers and your sisters a
[1:16:46] camaraderie to wear that you're so in
[1:16:49] love with each other that you don't even
[1:16:52] have to talk to them to where you just
[1:16:54] feel something's not right they're going
[1:16:57] through a hard time something's not
[1:16:58] right
[1:16:59] they need something oh Lord what is it
[1:17:02] Lord
[1:17:03] what a church we'd have at this place if
[1:17:06] every member of the body would take that
[1:17:08] on them the Lord what can I do what can
[1:17:12] I do to benefit Word of Life what can I
[1:17:16] do to help the young people the young
[1:17:19] brothers that are bearing burdens and
[1:17:21] going through this and that and the
[1:17:23] other somebody say Amen
[1:17:26] so we consider ourselves our house our
[1:17:30] financial situation of course our
[1:17:33] children we consider so much about us
[1:17:39] but what about our fellow brothers and
[1:17:41] sisters
[1:17:43] you see true Christianity brings us
[1:17:47] beyond our own nose
[1:17:53] some folks can see just maybe that far
[1:17:56] out
[1:18:01] or you want to do you want to go to
[1:18:03] church I didn't like Sunday's service I
[1:18:05] don't think we'll go back I didn't want
[1:18:07] to either
[1:18:08] also you think it's all about you
[1:18:12] you coming to church is not all about
[1:18:15] what you get and what you think and how
[1:18:18] you think the service ought to go
[1:18:24] oh Jesus
[1:18:26] well I'm kind of hoping I'll get to
[1:18:28] still be the pastor here for the
[1:18:30] dedication service but who knows I may
[1:18:32] be walking after this tonight huh
[1:18:34] now I want you to notice that Paul
[1:18:37] is saying that we must be taught or
[1:18:41] trained
[1:18:43] now I know every person in your thinks
[1:18:45] that they have just given birth with all
[1:18:47] their children
[1:18:49] to next to Gabriel and Michael and
[1:18:51] wormwood
[1:18:53] and Raphael and Ariel and all the rest
[1:18:56] of the owls
[1:18:58] but let me just correct you
[1:19:01] you gave birth
[1:19:03] to a hybrid mongrel
[1:19:06] that was born between Satan and Eve
[1:19:11] which that makes me mad well I'm sorry I
[1:19:13] didn't realize you got mad at brother
[1:19:14] Branham
[1:19:15] because brother Branham said every one
[1:19:17] of us that are born are born between
[1:19:19] Satan and Eve
[1:19:21] they've been raised in the message
[1:19:23] church I ain't got one thing to do with
[1:19:25] it they've got to be taught at home as
[1:19:28] well as behind the pulpit
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:31] Amen brother Donnie
[1:19:36] you see if we make this emphasis on our
[1:19:40] children
[1:19:42] that they themselves
[1:19:44] say I'm sure there's some of you after
[1:19:46] the service will say I didn't enjoy that
[1:19:49] supper well I've had a few suppers I've
[1:19:51] got that in Joe myself I'm kind of
[1:19:53] enjoying this supper tonight I think
[1:19:54] it's really good I think it's really
[1:19:56] lean
[1:19:58] yeah cut a lot of the calories and a lot
[1:20:00] of the Wahoos and this and that and the
[1:20:02] other out let's just get right down
[1:20:04] where the rubber meets the road what do
[1:20:06] you say let's just get right down where
[1:20:08] Christianity real bold Christianity and
[1:20:11] let's let the Lord just mold in us and
[1:20:14] shaping us broad material
[1:20:22] you see if we place the value and the
[1:20:25] importance in the hearts of our children
[1:20:28] this is not just the Sunday school
[1:20:30] teacher's responsibility or the youth
[1:20:32] leaders but more so the mother and
[1:20:34] father then it's not like oh sure some
[1:20:37] children are born more considerate than
[1:20:39] others but there are none none
[1:20:43] that are born as considerate as the
[1:20:46] Bible requires it
[1:20:49] you see the new birth changes everything
[1:20:52] about us what I'm reading to you tonight
[1:20:54] is not attainable by any of our births
[1:20:58] but I'm a preacher's kid I don't care if
[1:21:00] you're a moron's kid you're still got to
[1:21:03] have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:04] God not take a moron's kid made more out
[1:21:07] of another preacher's kid it's almost
[1:21:09] he's got the idea but that's God I'm a
[1:21:11] PK I was born in the field I cut my
[1:21:13] teeth on the pit we're not talking about
[1:21:14] where you cut your teeth we're talking
[1:21:16] about when you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:21:18] when the spirit of God was able to
[1:21:20] instill something in you to help you as
[1:21:24] a young man say Lord when I walk before
[1:21:27] you that day I want to walk up like this
[1:21:29] empty-handed
[1:21:33] young Brothers wouldn't it be awesome
[1:21:37] if the Lord Jesus come tonight
[1:21:40] or in the morning
[1:21:42] now your record in your book won't have
[1:21:44] near as many pages no doubt as mine
[1:21:46] because I've lived longer than you
[1:21:49] but wouldn't it be awesome if it comes
[1:21:51] this week or next week and you stand
[1:21:53] before the Lord and in your short life
[1:21:56] that God's given you you have page after
[1:21:59] page after page
[1:22:03] not gossiping text
[1:22:05] because believe it or not there's no
[1:22:07] reward for them
[1:22:09] oh wow
[1:22:12] Oh you mean there's no reward for none
[1:22:15] of that Tick Tock stuff you better spend
[1:22:17] more time Tick Tock in the things that
[1:22:20] matter instead of on tick tock
[1:22:24] y'all know about Instagram and you know
[1:22:26] about Facebook I think we need to spend
[1:22:28] more of our time with our face in his
[1:22:31] book
[1:22:32] well praise the Lord
[1:22:35] think about it friends do you think
[1:22:38] you're going to be rewarded for all the
[1:22:40] time you spent on Pinterest
[1:22:43] now I'm not against you doing that as
[1:22:45] long as you keep everything in Balance
[1:22:47] but remember your time your time
[1:22:52] is one of your most sacred commodities
[1:22:55] brother random said he never stole
[1:22:57] anything in his life that he knew of
[1:23:00] except
[1:23:03] he stole time
[1:23:05] from God
[1:23:08] let me just venture out and say here
[1:23:10] tonight there's probably every person in
[1:23:13] this building is a thief
[1:23:16] including the man preaching to you
[1:23:19] a thief
[1:23:21] of money
[1:23:23] of somebody else's wife
[1:23:25] time
[1:23:27] of the time God gave me
[1:23:30] the time that God has given you also
[1:23:33] I've got years of my life you don't know
[1:23:36] that
[1:23:37] you don't know that you'll live till
[1:23:39] tomorrow
[1:23:41] oh
[1:23:43] so we must train
[1:23:46] we must teach
[1:23:48] we must pray
[1:23:50] we must break out the final ground and
[1:23:53] the hearts of our children
[1:23:56] let me say this is why I so appreciate
[1:24:00] the desired of some of the older ones
[1:24:02] here too be able to be leaders to the
[1:24:06] youth don't we appreciate that ones that
[1:24:08] don't have an agenda let me say this
[1:24:11] also how much I appreciate every sermon
[1:24:16] every bit of time that brother West
[1:24:19] spent
[1:24:20] preaching studying whatever more to
[1:24:23] benefit our use
[1:24:25] I appreciate every young man that comes
[1:24:29] here the visiting ministers that we've
[1:24:30] been having to benefit our youth don't
[1:24:33] you I appreciate mother Rob I appreciate
[1:24:36] mother Joe I appreciate the sisters that
[1:24:38] come and prepare the meals that's right
[1:24:40] go ahead and give them a hand clap
[1:24:46] that takes from their time but can you
[1:24:49] imagine when brother Rob stands before
[1:24:51] God
[1:24:54] and him and Sister Sarah walked before
[1:24:56] the Lord
[1:24:58] and the book is opened
[1:25:02] and the Lord sees every phone call
[1:25:05] every text
[1:25:07] every meeting when he didn't really feel
[1:25:09] like coming but he came anyway
[1:25:12] brother Joe the same way these young
[1:25:14] ministers that come in here and preach
[1:25:16] to us and they stand before the Lord and
[1:25:18] they might have thought well it sure
[1:25:20] didn't seem like nothing happens but
[1:25:22] this person got healed that when God
[1:25:23] delivered this one got delivered that
[1:25:25] when God delivered and there they stand
[1:25:27] before God and say Lord I remember that
[1:25:29] service it sure seem like it was awful
[1:25:31] hard it didn't seem like there's nothing
[1:25:33] happened God said come look at it from
[1:25:34] my perspective this one God saved this
[1:25:37] one got the Holy Ghost this one got
[1:25:39] healed this one got delivered you
[1:25:41] thought you didn't do anything
[1:25:43] oh no
[1:25:47] oh my
[1:25:49] god notice Paul goes on to say let us
[1:25:52] consider one another to provoke
[1:25:56] what an unusual word that he chooses to
[1:26:00] use here not generally especially on the
[1:26:03] English language the way we look at
[1:26:05] provoke
[1:26:07] it's generally not very good
[1:26:09] whenever I say somebody provoked me I
[1:26:12] don't mean they tickle me made me laugh
[1:26:14] I don't mean they make me feel good
[1:26:16] generally they start up something in me
[1:26:18] that I don't like in me
[1:26:20] oh y'all said no look at me like a bunch
[1:26:23] of angels ain't you
[1:26:25] who's this word because
[1:26:32] you're up
[1:26:34] to really get them roused
[1:26:38] but not to anger
[1:26:41] read with me
[1:26:43] let us consider one another to provoke
[1:26:47] unto love
[1:26:50] and to Good Works
[1:26:52] wow
[1:26:54] so every one of us have a reputation
[1:26:58] either you're a complainer a grumbler a
[1:27:02] liar a gossiper a sad face the life of
[1:27:06] the party or no party conservative every
[1:27:09] one of us have a reputation and
[1:27:11] sometimes it's multifaceted you
[1:27:14] understand right so depending on the
[1:27:16] mood you're in where you are so this
[1:27:18] certain aspect of your personality will
[1:27:20] come out in certain times and then other
[1:27:21] times you're known by this because of
[1:27:23] what you're going through but every one
[1:27:26] of us are going to answer to the Lord
[1:27:28] for what we do with the way that God has
[1:27:31] saved us and the position that God's
[1:27:33] given us so we will either provoke
[1:27:35] people to anger we will provoke them
[1:27:38] when we get around them I mean we stir
[1:27:40] up one mess after another some people
[1:27:42] are known by that let me tell you why
[1:27:45] though that way as adults they started
[1:27:48] out that way as kids and nobody ever had
[1:27:51] enough nerve to tell them you need to
[1:27:53] change
[1:28:02] what's this Heir said on brother Jackie
[1:28:08] well that's the truth
[1:28:10] and if we think well it's just the way
[1:28:14] we are what we need to be changed
[1:28:18] if we provoke people to anger we provoke
[1:28:23] people to being upset maybe we really
[1:28:25] need to check our provoking power
[1:28:30] thank you Jesus
[1:28:32] let us consider one another to provoke
[1:28:35] unto love
[1:28:37] and two
[1:28:39] good works
[1:28:41] wow
[1:28:43] now good works not for justification of
[1:28:46] salvation
[1:28:47] but in order to be of a benefit to the
[1:28:51] body wow wouldn't that be something to
[1:28:53] have that testimony that people say
[1:28:55] about you every time I get around him
[1:28:58] I'm just so low he'll get up on that
[1:29:01] piano he'll go to play on that thing it
[1:29:03] just seemed like it lifts my spirit he
[1:29:05] may be lower than you are
[1:29:07] but God's gifted him same with brother
[1:29:09] Larry and the rest of these musicians
[1:29:11] are gifted you think these brothers are
[1:29:13] always on the mountain when they get up
[1:29:14] here sometimes they're probably so low
[1:29:17] they feel like not even getting up on
[1:29:19] the organ or the guitar the piano
[1:29:20] whatever it is but they get up here and
[1:29:23] they are faithful service after service
[1:29:25] they'll give up their worship time they
[1:29:28] give up their time to set by their
[1:29:30] family why so it can benefit you so they
[1:29:34] can create an atmosphere so the word of
[1:29:37] God can come further do we appreciate
[1:29:40] that
[1:29:41] so what do these brothers do what do the
[1:29:44] song leaders do they are provoking you
[1:29:46] to Good Works here's one of them
[1:29:51] I shall not be I shall not be moved
[1:29:55] that's a whole lot better for the song
[1:29:57] leader than I shall not be moved I shall
[1:30:02] not be I shall not be moved
[1:30:14] I want you to notice the very next verse
[1:30:18] in your Bible
[1:30:22] sometimes Carol will come to me
[1:30:24] maybe on Friday or Saturday
[1:30:27] sometimes even Thursday and she'll say
[1:30:29] what tape are you listening to I just
[1:30:31] want to kind of be in tune with what
[1:30:33] you're going to preach or can you give
[1:30:35] me some scriptures of what you're going
[1:30:36] to kind of preach on so I can just kind
[1:30:38] of be ready
[1:30:40] so yesterday we were sitting at the
[1:30:42] house and I opened up this and I started
[1:30:44] sharing some of these with her
[1:30:46] I want you to listen now to this this
[1:30:48] verse again verse 24 let us consider one
[1:30:50] another to provoke unto love and to good
[1:30:53] works and the very next verse
[1:30:57] is this one
[1:30:58] not forsaking the assembling
[1:31:02] ah
[1:31:05] wow
[1:31:08] you mean so we go from provoking one
[1:31:10] another to good works and the very next
[1:31:13] verse is the importance of going to
[1:31:17] church
[1:31:19] just be honest with me to any of how I
[1:31:22] have near as much trouble going to
[1:31:24] Walmart as you come into church
[1:31:27] and it amazing how all hell will break
[1:31:29] loose and you go to go to church and it
[1:31:31] seemed like every devil in hell will
[1:31:32] push you to Walmart go to Walmart go to
[1:31:35] Walmart go to Walmart go to Walmart
[1:31:39] they know somebody's going to Dent your
[1:31:41] new car and it's going to work on your
[1:31:43] temper when you get there they know
[1:31:45] you're going to see this person and that
[1:31:47] person and you're going to go right for
[1:31:48] that parking spot and you head in there
[1:31:50] and somebody goes right right in front
[1:31:52] of you say you sorry thing I was fixing
[1:31:58] uh-huh
[1:32:02] so you mean after good works yeah don't
[1:32:05] you understand going to church it's a
[1:32:07] great work
[1:32:10] so after good works and Paul says not
[1:32:13] forsaking
[1:32:15] listen friends at the meaning of this
[1:32:18] word
[1:32:21] leave
[1:32:23] abandon
[1:32:26] dessert
[1:32:28] leave in straights leave helpless
[1:32:37] selling people
[1:32:39] forsake the ascending of themselves
[1:32:43] I'm not talking about folks that are
[1:32:44] sick folks that live so far that can't
[1:32:46] make it on Wednesday night or you
[1:32:47] understand what I'm talking about but
[1:32:49] people that just don't see the value of
[1:32:52] it
[1:32:53] or they just say I don't need to go to
[1:32:55] church I'll stay home and play tapes
[1:32:58] I hear straight from the horse's mouth
[1:33:00] shame on you for referring to our
[1:33:02] Prophet as a horse
[1:33:05] so when they forsake to go to church
[1:33:08] this is the way God looks at it
[1:33:10] they leave
[1:33:13] they abandon
[1:33:17] they desert
[1:33:19] they leave in strengths
[1:33:21] they leave helpless wow
[1:33:25] totally abandoned
[1:33:29] this is the way God looks at people that
[1:33:32] develops this attitude and it is rampant
[1:33:34] all over the message then what about
[1:33:37] those that promote it and say this is
[1:33:39] the way of the end time oh we're not
[1:33:42] even supposed to go to church no more
[1:33:43] we're all supposed to gather around 12
[1:33:45] o'clock and we're all supposed to listen
[1:33:47] to the same tape
[1:33:49] are we really
[1:33:51] well let's see if that's what the Bible
[1:33:53] teaches and if it doesn't you're a false
[1:33:55] prophet
[1:34:03] forsaking not the assembling of
[1:34:06] ourselves
[1:34:08] yeah
[1:34:10] now let's see if this means spiritual
[1:34:12] let's see if it means all streaming at
[1:34:16] the same time
[1:34:19] this is the word Paul used
[1:34:21] Gathering Together
[1:34:23] assembling together
[1:34:26] a gathering together in
[1:34:31] oh
[1:34:35] so you and your home you and yours you
[1:34:37] and yours you and yours I'm sorry you
[1:34:40] cannot fulfill that scripture by doing
[1:34:43] so so you are disobeying God's original
[1:34:46] word
[1:34:47] [Applause]
[1:34:55] provoke good
[1:34:58] good it discourages people from the
[1:35:01] first basic understanding of being
[1:35:04] Christians that they assemble together
[1:35:06] in Christ Jesus
[1:35:09] now I want you to notice the next verse
[1:35:13] after that one
[1:35:15] after we're taught about going to church
[1:35:18] listen to the very next verse
[1:35:23] for if we sin
[1:35:26] willfully
[1:35:31] after that we have received the
[1:35:33] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:35:36] no more sacrifice for sins
[1:35:40] wow
[1:35:43] so you mean I took good works then we go
[1:35:45] into how we're going to be able to
[1:35:47] fulfill these good works we've got to be
[1:35:49] in a body
[1:35:50] we've got to assemble ourselves together
[1:35:52] then we've got to go to church and then
[1:35:54] we've got to be an influence one upon
[1:35:56] the other and if you look at this how
[1:35:58] that Paul says it about exhorting it's
[1:36:00] ministering to each other you cannot do
[1:36:03] that
[1:36:05] if a person closest to you is 500 miles
[1:36:07] down the road streaming
[1:36:13] if we sin willfully
[1:36:15] after we have received the knowledge of
[1:36:18] the truth notice Paul does not say
[1:36:19] you've received the truth
[1:36:22] but you receive the knowledge of it so
[1:36:24] you knew it was right but you never
[1:36:27] really received the truth I don't want
[1:36:29] just the knowledge of it I want the
[1:36:32] truth
[1:36:33] I wanted so much that my life lives what
[1:36:37] I profess I believe
[1:36:40] oh my praise the Lord
[1:36:43] there remain us no more sacrifice
[1:36:47] for sins and the church said
[1:36:51] notice again in James 2 26.
[1:36:54] for as the body without the spirit is
[1:36:57] dead so face without works
[1:37:01] is dead also
[1:37:02] so it's like brother random praying for
[1:37:05] the little boy who was club-footed in
[1:37:08] South Africa one of the worst he ever
[1:37:10] saw
[1:37:11] feet all twisted one leg shorter than
[1:37:14] the other
[1:37:15] he prayed for him that night
[1:37:18] the next day he met his father
[1:37:20] down on the street there
[1:37:22] I actually stood on that street several
[1:37:24] years ago went to the place where
[1:37:26] brother Branham stayed
[1:37:28] so I walked up and down that street
[1:37:30] where the meetings were I wondered
[1:37:33] whether that little boy was where his
[1:37:36] daddy stood you know just reminiscing in
[1:37:38] your mind brother random sees that
[1:37:40] little boy's Daddy
[1:37:42] fixing to go by his little boy a pair of
[1:37:45] shoes
[1:37:46] now what was he doing putting his face
[1:37:49] into expression by his works
[1:37:53] so he tells us Abraham done the same
[1:37:56] thing him and Sarah went to the doctor
[1:37:58] and said Doctor my wife is going to have
[1:38:01] a baby
[1:38:02] and he said you were this
[1:38:03] hundred-year-old man and his 90 year old
[1:38:06] wife and he said they got the bird eye
[1:38:08] which y'all know what bird eye is you
[1:38:10] don't know some of you do some of you
[1:38:12] don't all right birdot was the name they
[1:38:14] call cloth diapers in the 50s and the
[1:38:17] 60s I just solved a great mystery for
[1:38:19] many of you so the bird eye was the
[1:38:21] diaper so Abraham and Sarah went into
[1:38:24] the Toys R Us and all the babies are us
[1:38:26] stuff and they bought up diapers and
[1:38:28] pacifiers and all these things imagine
[1:38:30] going there and just kind of you know
[1:38:32] waddling around their stuff and said oh
[1:38:34] is this for your great great great great
[1:38:36] great great great
[1:38:37] grandchildren say no this is for our boy
[1:38:42] oh your boy what did you where is he
[1:38:46] well we ain't got him yet but we're
[1:38:48] expecting him any day hey honey that's
[1:38:50] not going to the dog let's say Lord have
[1:38:53] mercy for those things y'all stand right
[1:38:55] here we'll call 9-1-1 what size jacket
[1:38:58] do you wear oh the prophet said he went
[1:39:01] into the doctor's office and said the
[1:39:02] doctor running Plum out of the office
[1:39:04] well you know what's kind of similar
[1:39:06] today that the prophet said the doctor
[1:39:08] can sit and tell you there is no hope
[1:39:11] there's nothing else we can do but he
[1:39:14] said if God drops that in your heart you
[1:39:16] can set right thing life in the doctor's
[1:39:19] face why because the same face that was
[1:39:23] in Abraham is in you and the doctors say
[1:39:26] prepare your funeral and you say no sir
[1:39:29] I'm looking at a cruise into Norway
[1:39:36] express my face
[1:39:45] have you got your casket picked out
[1:39:48] nobody got an address because me and my
[1:39:51] husband's flying to Arizona
[1:39:53] but you don't understand this is
[1:39:56] terminal I know I've got to go from the
[1:39:58] terminal from Atlanta and then I'm going
[1:39:59] to fly to Salt Lake I know there's a
[1:40:01] terminal there but I'm going to be all
[1:40:02] right talk don't worry about no you
[1:40:04] don't understand there's never been
[1:40:06] anybody ever healed of this oh y'all
[1:40:08] remember reading that in the Bible uh
[1:40:10] let me say what was his name Lazarus oh
[1:40:12] yeah I remember him now and they could
[1:40:14] say nobody has ever been raised
[1:40:16] historically there's not one record
[1:40:18] facts there's not one record of a man
[1:40:20] that had been raised four days after his
[1:40:22] death not one man or a woman after the
[1:40:25] No sell it that they ever got up again
[1:40:27] facts facts was it was totally
[1:40:30] impossible facts was his body was rotten
[1:40:32] but the truth was the resurrection and
[1:40:35] the life stood there and he said lies
[1:40:38] rise come forth
[1:40:41] so what are we going to believe what God
[1:40:43] said I want the doctor said I want your
[1:40:47] mistakes say
[1:40:54] Hallelujah
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:41:08] praise the Lord
[1:41:11] how many wants good works
[1:41:14] not provoke to anger
[1:41:17] young people adults older people
[1:41:21] how we ought to judge everything we do
[1:41:25] we ought to judge our effect on people
[1:41:29] wouldn't it be awful
[1:41:31] to have to stand before the Lord and he
[1:41:33] was known as a troublemaker in Earth and
[1:41:36] you stand there and there's a record of
[1:41:38] you causing this man trouble that woman
[1:41:40] trouble this young person trouble this
[1:41:43] person trouble you put this into a
[1:41:45] horrible burden you put this one through
[1:41:47] that and this one through that and
[1:41:49] there's a whole book of all kinds of
[1:41:52] nothing but chaos
[1:41:54] that you caused
[1:41:58] oh but mama will come to my rescue Mama
[1:42:00] might rescue you now
[1:42:02] but mama won't be able to erase that
[1:42:04] book
[1:42:06] daddy will not be able to separate so
[1:42:08] now Lord Jesus I'll tell you what that
[1:42:10] run in my family no
[1:42:12] will everyone have to stand there before
[1:42:15] the Lord I could fall back on well
[1:42:17] that's a Reagan way well that's a shout
[1:42:19] way that's a McGillicuddy that's this
[1:42:21] and that and the other but God's going
[1:42:23] to say down there I thought she was born
[1:42:24] again
[1:42:25] I'll talk to you about a new nature
[1:42:30] praise the Lord
[1:42:32] how many once a book
[1:42:35] a book
[1:42:37] not a page not a paragraph but a book
[1:42:41] of works
[1:42:42] that have pleased the Lord
[1:42:44] not free rewards say oh I'm doing this
[1:42:47] now I'm going to work and working
[1:42:48] working work so I'll have this gigantic
[1:42:51] encyclopedia boy no your motive is done
[1:42:54] it right
[1:42:55] you want to do it because Jesus has
[1:42:57] given you an ability to help
[1:43:00] an ability to influence in the right way
[1:43:03] an influence to say things that'll
[1:43:05] encourage people
[1:43:08] and you want to do it because he gave
[1:43:10] you that ability
[1:43:12] I don't know that I'll ever forget it
[1:43:14] Carol and I said many years ago
[1:43:17] down in Kentucky where we lived
[1:43:20] and a little single wide trailer sitting
[1:43:22] on the front porch that would built on
[1:43:24] it
[1:43:25] on a swing that I'd put there just
[1:43:27] talking about the Lord and his Mercy
[1:43:30] just talking about what the Lord might
[1:43:32] want us to do for him and of course we
[1:43:34] didn't know
[1:43:36] but we just sat there and talked and
[1:43:38] prayed a little and just said Lord
[1:43:40] whatever you'd like for us to do
[1:43:42] we we'd be glad to do it
[1:43:45] if you want us to help people
[1:43:48] Lord you put the money in their hands if
[1:43:50] you want us to reach out to people we'll
[1:43:51] do this and that we we don't know
[1:43:55] I remember
[1:43:57] I'm sitting there she's sitting there
[1:44:00] nobody knew Donnie Reagan
[1:44:02] nobody knew me
[1:44:04] nobody knew her
[1:44:07] if he would have showed me
[1:44:09] that I was going to travel all over the
[1:44:11] world you got to be kidding me the
[1:44:12] people from Happy top said Donnie Reagan
[1:44:15] is going to Africa Donnie Reagan is
[1:44:18] going to India Donnie Reagan ain't that
[1:44:21] Don and Betty's boy
[1:44:23] you got to be kidding me that boy ain't
[1:44:25] even hardly been out of habitat
[1:44:27] only place he went to from Happy top to
[1:44:29] Wendy
[1:44:30] and then from there to Parnell and back
[1:44:33] he's going to go around the world he's
[1:44:35] going to preach the gospel in all these
[1:44:37] different nations
[1:44:39] not the Donnie Reagan I know I agree
[1:44:42] it wasn't the Donnie Reagan they knew
[1:44:45] it was another one
[1:44:48] who would have ever thought Daryl Ward
[1:44:51] Daryl Ward's going to travel everywhere
[1:44:53] and preach
[1:44:55] he's going to pray for people around the
[1:44:57] world all kinds of Miracles are going to
[1:45:00] follow Daryl Ward
[1:45:05] but you see if we can put ourselves into
[1:45:07] the hands of the master
[1:45:10] if time would Tarry there might be a
[1:45:13] young man standing here today
[1:45:15] that'll be a preacher that'll take this
[1:45:18] message and sweep it around the world
[1:45:19] brother Donnie what maybe my son Maybe
[1:45:25] but if he don't do that maybe he'll
[1:45:27] encourage one of his little buddies
[1:45:29] maybe they'll grow up a little farther
[1:45:31] and they'll they'll come to a spot where
[1:45:33] they're just going through such hell
[1:45:34] they don't know what the answer is and
[1:45:36] he'll text his little buddy one day hey
[1:45:38] I was reading my Bible and I thought
[1:45:39] about you and just come on my heart are
[1:45:42] you okay no I'm going through terrible
[1:45:44] terrible things
[1:45:46] listen children don't think that your
[1:45:48] children are free from this
[1:45:52] our government
[1:45:54] as local our federal government
[1:45:58] is promoting this transgender saying
[1:46:03] trying to convince our kids that they're
[1:46:06] born boys and they should be girls and
[1:46:08] this and that and the other if the devil
[1:46:10] is doing that to the kids out there
[1:46:13] what do we need to do instill in our
[1:46:17] kids godliness Holiness righteousness
[1:46:20] Purity not selfishness not
[1:46:23] self-centeredness Christ
[1:46:30] different states I heard it yesterday
[1:46:32] are trying to start Sanctuary places
[1:46:36] to worry that if your child a minor
[1:46:39] wants to be a transgender or changed and
[1:46:42] you won't let them the government will
[1:46:44] take them from you
[1:46:46] and place them in that Sanctuary state
[1:46:49] and let them be changed
[1:46:52] well the Lord's got a sanctuary State
[1:46:54] too but it ain't that much of perversion
[1:46:57] it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ so young
[1:47:01] people you can be set free from the
[1:47:03] world and it's Darkness out here and
[1:47:06] come to this sanctuary in Christ Jesus
[1:47:09] Hallelujah
[1:47:11] Hallelujah
[1:47:16] and what do you think a lot of those
[1:47:18] transgender kids are going to do they're
[1:47:21] going to try to make more kids like them
[1:47:24] come on they're going to try to convince
[1:47:27] them why Satan broke into God's program
[1:47:31] of spreading the gospel so what do you
[1:47:34] do you get two or three people that are
[1:47:36] eat up with this transgender deal or it
[1:47:39] started out as a minority but look how
[1:47:41] much it's grown in the last few years
[1:47:43] look around us
[1:47:45] look how many men you see but dresses on
[1:47:47] friends don't be blind what is it it's
[1:47:50] influence what if the devil learned that
[1:47:53] influence where the hell out of it from
[1:47:55] he learned it from God and he thought
[1:47:57] that's a great idea but if the devil can
[1:48:00] influence with the power of Darkness
[1:48:02] what about the power of the Gospel
[1:48:12] don't take for granted that your
[1:48:15] children know
[1:48:16] that when they're smacked on One Cheek
[1:48:18] to turn the other
[1:48:20] what you need to take for granted is
[1:48:22] they're born with that rebellion in them
[1:48:26] that if somebody smacks them they will
[1:48:29] smack them back
[1:48:30] we take too much for granted you take
[1:48:34] for granted that everything they look at
[1:48:36] on their phone is Gospel oriented
[1:48:40] you might be surprised I hear it all the
[1:48:43] time and my travels around the world for
[1:48:46] things that folks find out about their
[1:48:48] kids and the parents are totally blown
[1:48:51] away why they never ask they never
[1:48:54] inquired and they never even looked at
[1:48:57] their kids phones and they trust them to
[1:48:59] the High Heavens
[1:49:02] I wonder what's the matter with us our
[1:49:05] kids are as lost as they can be
[1:49:07] until they are filled with the Holy
[1:49:09] Ghost raised in a message Q does not
[1:49:12] make them holy it does not make them
[1:49:15] righteous they are born lost
[1:49:19] oh my
[1:49:20] we need to spend more time around our
[1:49:22] family bible I think
[1:49:24] more time instead of assuming they
[1:49:27] understand the Ten Commandments assuming
[1:49:29] they understand all the Divine
[1:49:31] principles of this and that why don't
[1:49:33] you ask them sometime
[1:49:36] why don't you ask them to tell you the
[1:49:38] Ten Commandments
[1:49:40] oh Lord some of these young men about to
[1:49:41] pass out right now brother
[1:49:46] we assume they know we assume they do
[1:49:49] this really
[1:49:51] well maybe we should assume they've got
[1:49:53] to be taught
[1:49:55] and trained
[1:49:57] not only from here
[1:49:58] I'll preached some twice a week
[1:50:00] brother our brother Joe has them a
[1:50:02] couple times a week every other week
[1:50:04] rather
[1:50:05] how much time do you have them
[1:50:09] oh goodness
[1:50:12] well believe it or not I love you
[1:50:15] [Applause]
[1:50:26] praise the Lord
[1:50:29] praise the Lord
[1:50:31] what about it young man
[1:50:33] young sisters
[1:50:35] when you stand before Jesus that day
[1:50:38] and he opens up your book
[1:50:42] and the ghosts are looking down through
[1:50:43] what's there
[1:50:45] don't you want to flood it
[1:50:47] with helps to the body
[1:50:50] to the Saints
[1:50:51] but I'm not a preacher don't have to be
[1:50:55] but you just want your life so full
[1:50:58] of good things but remember not only is
[1:51:01] there a record of good things
[1:51:03] but every argument that you've caused
[1:51:06] every fuss that you've caused
[1:51:09] every person that you've won at and
[1:51:11] you've picked at them
[1:51:14] I know what that's like
[1:51:17] my whole life in school
[1:51:19] I was picked at I was ridiculed I was
[1:51:23] laughed at I was made fun of I've told
[1:51:25] you before boys would bring pornographic
[1:51:27] magazines to school
[1:51:29] and I put my hands over my eyes like
[1:51:31] this and they'd throw me down on the
[1:51:33] floor and they'd take their fingers and
[1:51:36] pry my eyes open and stick it in front
[1:51:37] of my eyes
[1:51:40] I was called Moses I was called Daniel I
[1:51:44] was called Jeremiah
[1:51:45] my response to them was I'd rather be
[1:51:48] called that than Lucifer
[1:51:53] which is what I call them
[1:51:59] I can still remember
[1:52:02] my first couple years of school standing
[1:52:05] I can remember it like yesterday
[1:52:07] standing on the playground at Wayne
[1:52:09] County Elementary School
[1:52:12] wishing somebody
[1:52:14] would talk to me
[1:52:16] because we were so poor I had ragged
[1:52:19] shoes
[1:52:20] my britches had holes in them before it
[1:52:22] was in style
[1:52:25] now your kids pay 75 dollars for a bunch
[1:52:27] of Levi's where they got a shotgun
[1:52:30] blow holes in them well my that's the
[1:52:32] way mine was before it was in style
[1:52:35] so it's poor
[1:52:37] always wanted somebody to like me
[1:52:40] my whole life I've been rejected I come
[1:52:42] to the message I thought boy I found
[1:52:44] some real friends here huh little did I
[1:52:47] know my biggest rejection would be here
[1:52:51] so you know what I know that feeling
[1:52:54] I don't want none of our kids to feel
[1:52:56] that way
[1:52:57] I don't want none of our adults to feel
[1:53:00] that way
[1:53:01] but brother Donnie we're poor and we
[1:53:03] don't fit in the church whoever treats
[1:53:05] you bad you let me know who they are
[1:53:09] and I'll pray for them
[1:53:13] oh you thought I was going to take my
[1:53:14] belts off didn't you
[1:53:23] listen friend we ought to make everybody
[1:53:26] feel welcome I don't care what their
[1:53:28] skin color is I don't care how much they
[1:53:30] make a year if we ever get to that place
[1:53:33] I'll sell this building and we'll move
[1:53:35] to a storefront we don't never want to
[1:53:39] have that attitude remember the Bible
[1:53:41] says the common people
[1:53:44] heard him gladly
[1:53:47] do you realize the Lord Jesus would have
[1:53:49] been the type of person that most people
[1:53:51] would have shunned
[1:53:55] he had one change of clothes
[1:54:00] Jesus didn't pack around the suitcase
[1:54:03] and a whole whole Chariot full of
[1:54:06] clothes
[1:54:07] he had one change
[1:54:13] he would have been so poor
[1:54:15] most of us
[1:54:17] would have been felt comfortable being
[1:54:19] around him
[1:54:20] don't treat people bad because they
[1:54:22] don't have what you have
[1:54:24] because keep in mind Jesus was that way
[1:54:26] one day
[1:54:30] one day some disciples come and said
[1:54:32] Lord
[1:54:32] where you live at
[1:54:35] he said the foxes have holes
[1:54:38] and the birds of the air have missed
[1:54:42] but the son of man don't even own a
[1:54:43] house
[1:54:46] I don't even have a place to lay my head
[1:54:47] can you imagine
[1:54:49] here for 30 years
[1:54:52] homeless
[1:54:55] homeless
[1:54:58] so he stayed with Lazarus Mary Martha he
[1:55:02] stayed here he stayed there he stayed
[1:55:05] there
[1:55:06] he never had a house
[1:55:08] so you realize what some of our
[1:55:09] attitudes would do we would have looked
[1:55:12] down on the Lord Jesus and said well he
[1:55:14] don't make what I make
[1:55:16] look at his car Jesus never had a car or
[1:55:19] a chariot or a horse
[1:55:22] he never owned a horse
[1:55:24] he never owned a buggy a donkey he had
[1:55:28] to borrow a donkey to fulfill scripture
[1:55:30] he had to borrow a tomb to fulfill
[1:55:34] scripture
[1:55:35] he was so poor he had to borrow borrow
[1:55:39] borrow
[1:55:41] so many of the financial counselors of
[1:55:43] our day their Doctrine is false because
[1:55:46] it don't meet with the Lord Jesus on
[1:55:49] life
[1:55:52] and I wonder how we would treat him
[1:55:55] well I'll tell you how we would but by
[1:55:57] the way we treat his kids
[1:56:00] because brother random says the way you
[1:56:02] treat your brothers and sisters
[1:56:04] that's the way you treat Jesus
[1:56:06] so if you treat anybody bad or ill
[1:56:09] because their skin color their clothes
[1:56:11] are in a different Financial bracket
[1:56:13] than you
[1:56:14] then you're treating Jesus
[1:56:16] that same way
[1:56:19] and we get an air stick up our nose the
[1:56:21] prophet said if it rained and drowned
[1:56:22] you
[1:56:23] and what are you anyway
[1:56:25] six foot 165 pound of dirt
[1:56:31] some of you five foot 280 still a big
[1:56:34] pile of dirt
[1:56:35] this more dirt
[1:56:39] friends were nothing
[1:56:41] where do we get this
[1:56:43] tell you We inherited it
[1:56:48] from our births
[1:56:50] between Satan
[1:56:52] and Eve
[1:56:54] arrogance our pride
[1:57:04] who
[1:57:05] I dread more
[1:57:10] I know the first words is going to come
[1:57:12] out of her mouth when we get back on
[1:57:13] that office
[1:57:15] she'll walk back in and I'll be sitting
[1:57:17] her nose my bottom lip hung down about
[1:57:19] the bottom of my shoes
[1:57:22] she'll walk over at the desk and put her
[1:57:23] arm on my shoulder don't you let the
[1:57:25] devil beat you down now
[1:57:27] we needed that
[1:57:29] don't you let the devil beat you down
[1:57:37] Hallelujah
[1:57:41] it's about it
[1:57:46] Lord God forgive us
[1:57:51] Jesus I pray
[1:57:54] if I have ever
[1:57:57] treated one of your children
[1:58:00] in an eel way
[1:58:02] please forgive me
[1:58:05] if I have ever
[1:58:07] looked down
[1:58:09] on one
[1:58:11] if I've ever had the wrong attitude Lord
[1:58:15] please forgive me
[1:58:19] we do not profess to be a perfect people
[1:58:22] we profess to have a perfect sacrifice
[1:58:27] but we do want to be an obedient people
[1:58:31] so when we see we're wrong
[1:58:34] we ask you to forgive us
[1:58:38] so Lord I pray that you'd begin with me
[1:58:43] help me Lord that
[1:58:45] how many ever days I've got left in this
[1:58:47] life
[1:58:49] Lord Jesus and I'll use my time wisely
[1:58:55] Lord God I ask you for these sheep
[1:58:58] that you've put into my charge
[1:59:01] help them Lord
[1:59:04] help the young the middle age the elders
[1:59:08] to realize the allotment of time that we
[1:59:11] have
[1:59:12] it's precious they may not believe it
[1:59:15] now but it's worth more than their money
[1:59:18] what would the richest people in the
[1:59:20] world laying at the point of death and
[1:59:22] give everything they own for another
[1:59:24] hour of life
[1:59:26] because when it all said and done which
[1:59:29] is worse the most life or money
[1:59:32] life or wealth
[1:59:35] life will went out every time
[1:59:39] Lord May our young people realize they
[1:59:42] don't need to wait till the 30 or 40 to
[1:59:45] have a character that is so represent
[1:59:48] representative of Christ
[1:59:51] help them to realize everything they do
[1:59:54] Lord
[1:59:55] if they put a stumbling block in front
[1:59:57] of someone's way if they say something
[1:59:59] to push down instead of lifting up if
[2:00:02] they say something to embarrass or
[2:00:04] humiliate
[2:00:05] that was actually recorded in a book
[2:00:09] in heaven
[2:00:11] no wonder your Prophet told us if we
[2:00:13] cannot say something good about people
[2:00:16] we should not say anything at all
[2:00:20] so in other words most of us should do a
[2:00:22] whole lot less talking
[2:00:25] would be a whole lot better people
[2:00:27] but we tend to think if it runs through
[2:00:29] our crazy head we better say it which is
[2:00:32] totally contrary to the Bible
[2:00:34] the Bible says be swift to hear and slow
[2:00:38] to speak
[2:00:39] I'm glad I don't think everything that
[2:00:41] goes through this knucklehead of mine
[2:00:44] help us God
[2:00:46] give us wisdom
[2:00:48] oh no wonder your Bible says a word
[2:00:52] fitly spoken
[2:00:54] it's like apples of gold
[2:00:57] in pictures of silver
[2:01:01] there's a little brief sentence to an
[2:01:03] individual could encourage them
[2:01:06] one of criticism or sarcasm
[2:01:09] can discourage them to what they feel
[2:01:11] like there's no need to even go on
[2:01:13] I pray God there's none of them on my
[2:01:16] book
[2:01:18] Lord if they are
[2:01:20] I Repent tonight
[2:01:23] if there's any Lord God statements
[2:01:28] that are made to any of your children
[2:01:30] around the world
[2:01:32] that's discouraged
[2:01:34] or disheartened
[2:01:37] I ask you to forgive me Lord
[2:01:42] let what's written in my book
[2:01:45] be that I encouraged I lifted up
[2:01:48] oh I might had to whoop them a little
[2:01:50] bit make them feel a little bad
[2:01:52] but in return it'll make them feel
[2:01:54] better
[2:01:56] I want you granted Lord
[2:01:59] I wonder when no one looking around
[2:02:02] how many would say that tonight Lord
[2:02:05] if there's anything on my book that I
[2:02:07] I've done against anybody
[2:02:10] if I discourage and criticize and had
[2:02:12] sarcasm and
[2:02:14] Lord would you please forgive me don't
[2:02:16] don't make me meet that Lord
[2:02:18] anybody just raise hand to God God bless
[2:02:20] your Saints oh my goodness bless your
[2:02:22] heart
[2:02:24] those of you out there streaming to
[2:02:27] Lord I know this ain't deep
[2:02:30] but oh Jesus I think
[2:02:33] it goes down to where we are
[2:02:36] we want to be better people father
[2:02:40] Lord God we want to live in a way that
[2:02:42] you can use us Lord and trust us
[2:02:46] I believe there's great times laying in
[2:02:48] front of us Lord but I believe that
[2:02:50] you're calling for us to step higher
[2:02:53] get closer Lord
[2:02:55] and no matter how close we think we are
[2:02:57] to you we can pretty well judge that by
[2:03:00] the way we treat our brothers and
[2:03:01] sisters
[2:03:04] so your Prophet went on to say that
[2:03:07] you call men to preach the gospel and
[2:03:10] the way that people respect that man of
[2:03:13] God
[2:03:14] is the way they respect you so if people
[2:03:16] disrespect a god-called man
[2:03:19] they're disrespecting you but it's not
[2:03:22] just limited to the preacher
[2:03:24] but Lord we're members of one another
[2:03:27] help us Lord
[2:03:30] I pray you'd go through the many pages
[2:03:32] of the book of my life
[2:03:34] Lord if there's anything you find there
[2:03:36] dear God
[2:03:38] that needs to be taken care of
[2:03:41] if I need to speak to anybody if I need
[2:03:43] to call somebody up
[2:03:46] let me know Lord
[2:03:48] let me know
[2:03:51] oh Jesus May you search every heart in
[2:03:53] this place tonight
[2:03:55] I know it seems unusual Lord a couple of
[2:03:58] services this way but I'm going to
[2:04:00] follow your leading Lord
[2:04:02] I know from the service Sunday the text
[2:04:04] the emails the phone calls all the
[2:04:06] things that I got it was definitely you
[2:04:08] Lord for whatever reason you pull us
[2:04:10] right back that way again tonight so
[2:04:12] lord it's for a reason
[2:04:14] I'm one of them I believe Lord
[2:04:17] oh Jesus we love you we worship you
[2:04:21] I just lay my book before you
[2:04:23] it'll be too late to try to erase any of
[2:04:26] that stuff then Lord
[2:04:28] when I woke up there before you I can't
[2:04:30] grab that book and say Lord could I have
[2:04:31] a few minutes please could I could I
[2:04:34] take care of a few things
[2:04:36] nope
[2:04:37] Lord God I want him taken care of
[2:04:39] tonight
[2:04:40] and Lord I Want to Love or I want to
[2:04:43] understand more
[2:04:45] I want to be a a more yielded Christian
[2:04:48] so I don't add any new junk
[2:04:51] into them pages
[2:04:54] let me fill the rest of the pages of my
[2:04:56] life with good things
[2:04:58] Mercy kindness forgiveness encouraging
[2:05:03] Works encouraging words words to provoke
[2:05:08] words to help
[2:05:11] granted Lord God
[2:05:14] can we just raise our hands
[2:05:16] in the presence of the Lord and just
[2:05:18] however you wish to say it me too Lord
[2:05:21] me too Lord
[2:05:23] take care of anything in my pages Dear
[2:05:25] God
[2:05:26] just tell them in your way friends
[2:05:29] oh my let us walk out of this place
[2:05:31] tonight
[2:05:32] with a brand new desire
[2:05:34] a brand new determination
[2:05:36] whatever word
[2:05:38] think about what you say think about the
[2:05:40] way you treat people
[2:05:41] you're saying well I want to get back at
[2:05:43] them and remember when you do that that
[2:05:46] is recorded in heaven

[2:15:34] so hopefully with our understanding
[2:15:37] enlightened a little bit tonight
[2:15:40] so if something broke out in your body
[2:15:43] and your white blood cells begin to
[2:15:45] attack
[2:15:46] and what did they do they go to that
[2:15:48] infected area that position in your body
[2:15:51] and them little soldiers as they call it
[2:15:53] they begin to Rally
[2:15:55] around that infection that's something
[2:15:58] that's going on in your body
[2:16:00] so when the doctors will check your
[2:16:02] blood count
[2:16:03] your white blood count is going to be
[2:16:05] raised and they're going to watch
[2:16:06] something's going on something's not
[2:16:07] right here there's an infection
[2:16:09] somewhere something's not right your
[2:16:11] body will respond to a fever and
[2:16:13] different things will happen them little
[2:16:15] soldiers are giving their life
[2:16:18] are trying to protect you
[2:16:21] God gave you an immune system
[2:16:24] you see the immunity of the church
[2:16:27] is not just by staying home but coming
[2:16:30] together with the saints of God
[2:16:32] so anyone who pulls off and pulls away
[2:16:35] you're pulling away from the body's
[2:16:38] ability and the spiritual immune system
[2:16:40] to Rally around you and to help you what
[2:16:44] for to recover not to come and point our
[2:16:47] finger at you and say you low down sorry
[2:16:50] thing no to come and rally around you
[2:16:53] and to try as soldiers to help lift you
[2:16:56] up to get you well because when you're
[2:16:59] sick when you're sick if we don't get
[2:17:02] that under control it can go through the
[2:17:04] entire body
[2:17:06] right yeah
