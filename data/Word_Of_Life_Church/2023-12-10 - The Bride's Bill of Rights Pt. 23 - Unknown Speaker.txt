think that's right give all of them a good hand this morning amen let's all stand just po brother Donnie comes this morning God bless every one of you for being here Jesus I love to call in your Holy Name how many of you appreciate the opportunity to get to call on the name of the Lord let's sing a little bit that this morning if you will oh Jesus my Jesus how I love to call on your name oh Jesus Sweet Jesus every your name is the same oh Jesus Sweet Jesus how I love to call on your name Jesus Sweet Jesus every day your name is the same I think we just invented a new Melody to that song don't you but it was good give our pastor a real good hand as he comes to bring you the word of the Lord this morning how on the world can I fix that mess praise the Lord ain't it wonderful to be a child of God today to be able to gather together in the presence of the Lord and we realize during this time of the year a lot of folks get all religious and you know we talking about the birth of the king and all that but I'm glad for the real people of God it's not just something we talk about once a year it is the reason we live he came that we might have life and have it more abundantly I'm so grateful for that today aren't you let's uh turn the scripture if you would today to the book of second Timothy chapter 1 while you're turning there I'd like to make this announcement Dan and Lynette Robbins and Larry and Sher Jenkins would like to announce the engagement of cin Robbins to Josh Jenkins we're happy for him and we're praying that he'll move up his way so he don't take another one of our daughters of God down there in the Egypt land in South Carolina I told him years ago God delivered his people out of them swamps what in the world would anybody want to go back for it's beyond me amen was that you brother Tom and said amen he's praying for deliverance of his family too from down there something amen praise the Lord second Timothy chap 1: 7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind so fear exaggerates the causes of fear without Inner Fear exaggerates the causes of fear that are without so the spirit of power is simply the the spirit of God in a person's soul that helps them it imparts a power to help them to overcome fear aren't you glad for that yeah so this power is actually what cast fear out we can't do it on our own 1 John 4:1 17 herein is our love made perfect I want you to notice that when you get this love it's not complete but it has to be made complete herein is our love made perfect look at the meaning of the word with me to Leo to finish fulfill make perfect complete to carry through completely to accomplish bring to an end add what is yet wanting in order to render a thing full so a lot of times when we use the word perfect we think of perfection and sinlessness and without a fault but that's not the way John is using this about perfect love it's love that reaches its height its finish its end I trust each of us want that today with all of our hearts how many like to be remembered today as we pray before the Lord got a couple of prayer calls here today that we' like to pray over as well no doubt many needs we know we got several that are sick in the church today and unable to be here so we just pray that God would be with us let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father we love you so much today we thank you for your grace and mercy to us Lord we're just asking that you would help us in this service you see our needs and they are many Lord we have several that are sick today and unable to be in service maybe some came and they weren't feeling well but they pressed beyond their feelings to come anyway so we pray that you just be mindful of each one Lord those that are streaming the service from around the world whatever their needs might be would you be mindful of them as well father we've come that we might be benefited by gathering together Lord Jesus we're so grateful that you come to the Earth if you had not we'd all be lost and we're grateful that you didn't just come and heal the sick you did that before you even died but if you would have done all of that and then ascended up into heaven and never given your blood we still would be lost today and we're thankful not only for healing but for salvation so may you be mindful of these needs Lord God these prayer requests that I have in my hand you know the needs dear God and we're asking you for your mercy help us Lord I I'm no doubt I'm the most needy person in the building today I need your help to try to speak something that would help your children encourage them strengthen them maybe lift them up whatever more they need help me father that I can get out of the way I pray in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated I'm sure most of you would agree with me today that this life offers us hardly anything that is perfect there are no perfect churches there are no perfect preachers we hear people say well so and so and so and so has a perfect marriage you ought to be with them when they're not so perfect though so there's very few things when you think about it that is actually perfect think we could place them on our hands perfect moms perfect dads perfect this perfect that hardly anything that you and I could think of today that would actually be perfect but yet God has given us a way to where we can have perfect things but they all must come from him perfect Faith perfect love many things that God's given us but yet when we look at what the description or the definition if I would ask you hundreds of people here today how many of you would say well perfect love is this this and this I'd ask this brother maybe these young men here I'd ask brother Nathan maybe some of you sisters what is perfect love well your definition might vary from one to the other you say well perfect love is this and perfect love is that and someone else is saying no it's not that it's it's totally different it's this and that and the other but we've been looking at the rights that God has purchased and given for his bride the elect of God and absolutely I believe that perfect love is one of our rights it's not only a right it's actually a requirement to ever be able to move into the sixth Dimension if you go by the way of death it's the only way you'll ever never be able to enter into the essence of eternal life now eternal life is something we know that is given to some at the white Throne judgment given to them the opportunity to be able to go into the kingdom of eternal life but there are people on the Earth today that already have eternal life now many think they get it when they believe on the Lord but we know a thorough study of the scripture shows us that it's more than just accepting him as your savior so as if it is one of our rights and actually a requirement I think that each of us should be so determined more than anything else in the world after everything that we get so you have your goals you have your motives your objectives as we call it in this day your bucket list of what you want to do where you want to go things you want to see or doubt each one of you do there's things you want to do before you pass there's things you'd like to accomplish things you'd like to see for your family things you'd like to see maybe for our church and yet all of that might be well and good but none of those things might be inclusive to allow you to be able to enter into the paradise of God but perfect faith will so money is not a requirement thank God good looks ain't a requirement double thank God for that I'm so glad that wealth and notoriety and popularity it's not a requirement but for one who went beyond the curtain of time and come back and told us what it was like and they actually told him what he was already preaching but he had not quite made the connection that the Holy Ghost was perfect love so once he went there and came back then they told him this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love so the way John States it here perfect love is not something that's separate from Divine love or separate from divine nature it's actually the same thing only stated a little bit different but this is different than the gifts now we believe in the gifts here we thank God for the spiritual gifts but these are Divine Graces not Divine gifts the Divine Graces are hope and charity and those things but Divine gifts are totally different now I've seen gifts all of my life I've seen folks prophesy speak in tongues interpret I don't know that I've actually ever seen a perfect one yet and I believe the reason is because the foundation of the gifts is not Divine love but it's to desire to be a gifted person more so than upon the basis of perfect Love Now is it important are gifts important absolutely they are so important the Lord would never give them if they were not important but in my years and my tenure in Pentecost and I would see people speak in tongues and prophesy and interpret and you know most of the time it was just a questionable something or it would be hit and miss and they would hit and miss and hit and miss and we know the prophet tells us in the church age book that it would come in the last days that there would be those that that would operate gifts with a margin of error in them a margin of error so they would be able to call somebody out or prophesy over them or whatever and they would hit this one hit that one hit that one and then maybe Miss every fourth one or every third one or every fifth one and they would miss it was constantly hit Miss hit Miss now can a person like that have a real gift from God yes they might really have a genuine gift from God but if it's not built upon the foundation of perfect love perfect love is the only thing that produces perfect gifts now perfect love is not something any of us can have on our own there's not one human being that has ever lived on the earth after the fall other than the Lord Jesus who ever had perfect love I love the way the prophet explains love and he says it was like the great big ocean that God's love was like the ocean and then it trickles down from a lake to a smaller stream and then a smaller one and a smaller one and it trickles down and trickles down and the farther down it comes from the original ocean the less pure it is in its nature so those of you that love your husbands and wives tonight y'all too thank God but if you don't have divine love then that's what causes divorce that's what causes separation is because a man and woman they get tired of each other and they're human love they fall out of love with each other the same way they fell in love they can also fall out of love but if they have Divine love coupled with their human love then their human love will help them to love their husband or wife even whenever maybe they're not really lovable because that's the way we were we were not lovable when he saved us and filled us with the Holy Ghost then he actually made us lovable aren't you glad now this is part of our rights as the people of God let me read this to you uh the prophet says it this when every man here tonight would realize that things that you got Divine health and everything else God gave it to you at Calvary every born again man is circumcised by the Holy Ghost and you have a right for every Redemptive blessing let the devil rob you of none of it now it ought to be our determination whatever God has for me I'm going to get it before I leave this life amen it makes no difference if it's spiritual Supernatural if it's natural blessings whatever he wants me to have I want every one of them now listen how this couples together now in the restoration of the Bride tree he promised to restore the church in these when the evening light shine we're living in it and by restoring we have a right so by the restoration of the message of Malachi 4 then it brings to us a right notice he said we have a right we have our attorney we have our lawyer our high priest and we're going to force a claim so we have a right first of all as the children of God and then we also have the ability to force a claim you've had them long enough you can't do it any longer we're ordained in the name of Jesus Christ now love like every other Grace is something that will be revealed in degrees now remember when you receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost it is everything you'll ever need in seed form in you is the potential of your rapture of your body change of every healing of every Revelation you'll ever need but see being that Divine love is a Grace like hope like faith it does not come to you in the fullness of that whenever you receive it so God will allow that Grace to grow and grow and grow so love is in you when you're born again by the spirit of God but is it perfect love it is not I I wonder if we would be able to look tonight or today rather and God would pro project it on these screens here the name of every person that's here this morning every person on one side would have perfect love and those on the other side have love but not perfect or mature love I wonder how many of us it would be I wonder how many of us that have been saved for maybe years but yet our degree of love has never entered the proper Temperance to where God would identify us as m mat love that it's reached its end and then when it reaches its end you'll be able to live at the end of that love now you may be allowed to live for 6 months 5 years 10 years who knows how long it'll be but when you've reached the end then you move into that final Temperance of love you are ready for the sixth Dimension you are ready for deaths if that be the will of God for your life and then if not then you are ready for the height of your service to God like you've never been before now whenever John begins to write about this and he's the only one that actually uses these terms together and John sets it forth I love the way that he writes it whenever he says then that hereby is our love made perfect so it's made perfect so it's not received in the fullness form it's received in seed form as graces are Grace is different than gifts the gifts are wonderful they are marvelous and I believe according to the word of God that gifts are something that God placed in the church himself and I believe that if we could ever walk into love first then we would see a manifestation of real perfect gifts in a way that we've never seen it before because then it would be with no selfishness are no self-center this you see a lot of people actually have Divine gifts but they're still operating it in a measure or a Temperance of love that has not yet reached maturity because you watch them when they use that gift and they'll turn it always right back around and it's well I prayed for so and so and this person got healed in my church or this person got healed in my prayer line and this person done this and all they say they're giving testimony to the glory of God but it's it's amazing because they hardly ever testify of what God's doing in other churches or what God's doing in other preachers lives it's always what God's doing in them and their church and their life well y'all didn't say Amen to that now you see perfect love has no problem with where God is doing Miracles even if it's outside of their own church a preacher that has perfect love and operates a Divine gift he can re choice just as much if God performs a miracle raises the dead heals the sick and someone else's ministry as much as he can his own why because his gift is operated on the basis of perfect love that has reached a stage of maturity now many men I believe with all of my heart they love the people of God and they love God and they want to operate gifts in order to help people but they do it on a basis of immature love imperfect love and then it will always come back to them and you watch them oh I know I hate to Hate to repeat it but I saw it so much in Pentecost and I'm seeing the same thing again in the message and it's just coming right back around again gifts here gifts there gifts somewhere else and someone told me the other day that young ministers are feeling so under the pressure that they've got to see a vision or have a dream or call somebody out I'm thinking what in the world is the matter with us why do we we have to go back that way and if we're not careful we're going to point people to become nothing but a generation of sign Seekers that's all they're going to be they're going to be a generation of sign Seekers and they will not be able to take God at his word without a feeling or a shout or a jump or a vision I believe in all of that but I Take God at his word without feeling anything I believe God Is A Healer whether I have a dream dream or whether you have a dream or whether you see a vision about me or not I believe God's word signs follow me I don't follow them but you watch people people are relocating they're moving there's a big move on again in the message and people are moving we a lot of moving to Jumping shouting churches sign seeking churches well that's well and good if you're LED with the Holy Ghost to do that but if you're just following a sign I feel sorry for you cuz Jesus tells us in the last days there will be people that will have all kinds of signs you see I saw this in Pentecost to where they preach constantly signs wonders Miracles but I never heard Matthew 2424 preached the whole time I was there so they did not warn their people of false anointed ones I see the same thing reoccurring again in the message that we're preaching anointing jumping shouting hollering all of that but has anybody got time to still preach Matthew 24:24 well I do I do and I'm going to warn you everybody that jumps and shouts ain't got it everybody that even lays hands on the sick ain't got it you need to broaden your spectrum a little bit and realize there's Miracles among Pentecostal people there's Miracles and healings and signs among Badness oh I don't believe it brother Donnie I sit right in the hospital with Erica and a woman come in a nurse come in and sit down and talked with us one to one of the Baptist Churches here and she was telling us of the different Miracles they had seen in their church you've come too late to tell me they don't have them they do but we tell them there she sit with bobhair painted face britches on everything else so if Miracles is all we need if that's the bride's Revival we might as well quit preaching Holiness then we might as well quit preaching the message why bear the reproach of being identified under Malachi 4th healing is all you need but we need more more than healing we need more than jumping we need all the word and yes healing is a part of the word but also is Holiness and clean living and righteous living come on somebody preach with me today with man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you see a man with a lower intensity of love will always bring himself into this I wonder sometimes if we still see at Lance and I was talking yesterday I told him you know Lance the reason that the Lord Jesus came one of them was that he might be able to bring a crucifixion to this thing about human love that we love and we love selfishly I'll just preach to myself today because I'm sure everybody here is a perfect angel and really doesn't even need this but boy there's some sorry folks that stream our services and and no doubt it it might be for Brother David mayor over in France or it might be for somebody over in Belgium brother Josh maybe you over in Belgium you might need to hear this message brother tune in real good and listen now so the temperance of love that will be released into the bride before the Rapture now you know the prophet tells us in shreport in 1965 when he rehearsed going beyond the curtain of time he said I believe the people that will go on the Rapture will be in this state before they leave now he was talking about perfect love perfect love is not selfish so it's not self-centered and there's something about all of our loves that's self-centered yeah you love your wife there's still an element of self involved what can she do for you and most of the time your arguments in your home you don't have to raise your hand or stand up but is it on the basis of divine love that y'all get into arguments come on is it on the basis that she's telling you you're being too good to her and too sweet and you're just so nice I'm mad I'm I mean you're making me mad you're so good to me woman I just can't take it no more shut down being so good to me y'all ever had anybody to tell you that but what is it you're not treating me right you're not doing this right you're not selfish youself so he's the first one since Adam when he come to the Earth to be able to express perfect love divine love which had no selfishness involved so you take a preacher very gifted so he can really speak really gifted and what God will do with that man will be measured according to the intensity of the love that he has as his Revelation grows now if his Revelation grows go and advances faster than the intensity of his love for god you watch what he'll become stuffed shirt know it all we know matter more than anybody else our church is the only church in the message oh my I get so sick of hearing that trash I get so sick of hearing all of that you know there's only two or three messages in the message churches that's really got the enlightenment of everything you better wake up and realize God's Prophet saw Millions on the curtain of time I personally don't know of any message churches that's got millions well praise the Lord but what is it you see a preacher with his gift if he does not operate and the more you learn how to preach of course and the more you learn how to surrender to God the more you will realize the intensity of your gift matching the intensity of your love and the more you get out of the way the more he can do it will be almost Limitless what God will do for an individual like that may may I not limit it today just to a preacher but if every lay person here men women boys girls teenagers whatever you are if we would fall so in love with him that we loved him more than everything else in this world it would be amazing what God would do in our church and yet we have a direct thus saith the Lord I have never found in all of my searching of the message of the Decades that I've been in it I have never found one thus saith the Lord you must shout thus sayth the Lord or you will not be there or one thus saith the Lord you must speak in tongues or one thus sayeth the Lord you've got to have a March around Jericho now if somehow I've overlooked that please send me the quote and I'll resend this statement on Wednesday or I can save you the time and say it ain't there but we do have a thus sayth the Lord it will take perfect love to get you there do we believe that do we seek it do we want it more than money more than position more than rank more than favor of people well let's just face the facts the truth of it is most of us don't want it bad enough some of you spent years working on a degree at school you applied yourself you studied nothing wrong with that as long as you don't make an idol out of it but I wonder if you would take that kind of urgency and desire for perfect love day and night you're hungering you're thirsting God I've got to have it I've got to have it I I want it more more fluent in my life I want it to such a Temperance that I find out someone in the church said something about me now human love will do this if I seen one of the brothers outside flirting with my wife human love now I'm not a violent man but I might feel kind of violent if I seen some man in this church going up taking a hold of my wife's hand and saying sister Carol you look so beautiful today I'd like to take you out on a date but unless he's a blind man he ain't going to be able to take her out cuz I'm going to see he ain't got no eyes left at least swole up for a few days well you see that's what the prophet said that a man would do with human love someone would say something to your wife and you'd want to hit him I'm just fulfilling the quote you see but he said perfect love would look at that man and forgive the man so then if someone places something about you on Facebook whether directly or indirectly and then someone tells you have you found out what so and so said they're talking about you I know they are they haven't mentioned your name but they might as well they have said you so which love do we operate out of human love or person love brother amen y'all enjoying this so much we might have service again this evening well there's going to be 20 of you show up the rest of you is going out for dinner and going home trying to recuperate ain't you now you see when love is perfected in us we have no fear of the Judgment no fear whatsoever When Love is perfected in us we we have no fear of death no fear of dying amen When Love is perfected in us we have no fear of what Satan can do to try to destroy us but when it's not perfect that's whenever you'll see a fear gripping people about death and about sickness what's this in Divine love the prophet said among other people everywhere is fear but love perfect love casteth out fear the reason you're fearful is is because the right Temperance of Love Now notice he doesn't say love is not entered into you but the right Temperance of love has never entered yet so you do have love but it's never grown and mature when there's real love all fear passes away when you really love the Lord now watch this in rejected King I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in in the room and said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can ere without it so the sixth Dimension is the Holy Ghost personified in theophany bodies are you imagine the inter and he's overwhelmed by what he sees and the way they're acting and the way that he feels cuz he he he felt different than he had ever felt before and all he could feel from these people and the women came first and they were hugging him my precious brother my precious brother and the brothers then came my precious Brethren now they were women in form and they were women in shape and so on but he said here we have the man has one gland the woman has another but he said there they were still in formed and in shape of women but yet that feeling could not be there toward them the way that it would be down here so he was overwhelmed by it because these women were coming hugging him and there was no human sexual response so that was different the glow the glitter in their eye he mentioned that over and over again there was something about their eyes our eyes now cannot be able to contain the illumination of light that they have in the sixth Dimension so their demeanor was different everything about the sphere that he entered into was so different and the voice said this is what you preach was a holy ghost you imagine thinking the Holy Ghost I mean did I didn't preach about the Holy Ghost being blue grass and the Holy Ghost being perfect love and the women but he had preached it but it hadn't yet quite been quickened to him till he went there so he said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost well wait a minute you know now they were running and yet we have no record that none of them jumped shouted spoken tongues or anything like that and no doubt they may have already done it they may have done been running and jumping my I don't know what all they do when they're there but that was not what the emphasis was upon it was not on any physical manifestation it was what was emanating from their souls which had now stepped into a theop now remember threes is a perfect identification of who you are as he is Father Son and Holy Ghost so are you Soul spirit and body when you leave this life you're still yet to be identified in the three so the soul which is the seed Gene of God leaves out of this Mortal body and it goes into what a sayopony body in the sixth Dimension your twos waiting for the third phase which is the resurrected body and the resurrection but there even though they had entered into that something he was identifying that this is what you preach was the Holy Ghost now he talked about a woman that he had went with a girl that he had dated what a great Christian woman she was and brother Daryl sent me this quote the other day and he said that whenever he went beyond the curtain of time he actually saw that woman there so she come up to him and identified him and recognized him and said oh our precious brother now would you notice this voice which was an Angelic voice a spiritual Supernatural voice this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there was no jealousy now we can love God and still have an element of that love mixed with jealousy let me tell you why because our love for God can still be affected and if we see God blessing somebody a little more than us if we're not careful we'll fight jealousy it's among preachers friends I'm telling you you watch God raise up a man and God use him for this that and other and if a preacher ain't got the right Temperance of Love he'll fight it don't sat there and look at me funny I've had preachers to come and tell me I'm jealous of this man I'm jealous of that man I'm jealous of you I'm jealous of that man that don't mean they're evil that means they're human beings and they've never yet entered into the right Temperance of love yet but real love can look at God raise up a man and use a man and maybe you'll maybe be this High spiritual and he'll be a giant in God but the real love of God said thank God for using my brother thank God for using my brother cuz it'll benefit the whole bride of Christ well praise the lord it's a same way with singers it's the same way with musicians I think I might go in the office and preach the rest of this sermon it's the same way with deacons and trustees and whoever more can we stand for God to use somebody and bless them a little more than He blesses us and not have an attitude oh praise the Lord notice there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never enter there mortality could never make you old and they could not cry think of that they could not cry there was just one Joy oh my precious brother rejected King whatever you do for friends lay aside everything else till you get perfect love get to a spot now he's going to help identify what perfect love will be get to a spot that you can love everybody every enemy everything else that one that one visit there to me has made me a different man I can never never never never be the same brother brandham that I was so did Brother random just get the Holy Ghost no but that had such an effect on him that it helped him move into a Temperance of love that he never had before I've had I don't know how many people to tell me and to share with me since Erica moved beyond the curtain of time that they had never had such a greater desire to go to heaven that had done something to them and had such an effect on them I find that amazing and here the prophet going beyond the curtain of time had preached for years had spoke spoken tongues had had miracles in his ministry and that this is 1960 and he started on the field back there the angel come to him in 33 so for decades Harry had had all kinds of Supernatural in his life all kinds of phenomenal oh my wonderful tremendous things happen and yet been able to go beyond the curtain of time and experience that had such an impact on him watch him again in this adoption series and he said thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all that was there so there's no human love mixed with an element of jealousy there was no Divine love even mixed with an element of jealousy so he's just overwhelmed I want you no notice he never saw streets of gold he never saw Mansions because that's a little bit higher he never said nothing about great you know things like that but it was on Earth magnified in the sense of that Dimension now this is all we know we come from God as a thought but I don't remember and neither do you so a holding place the six dimension for those souls and wouldn't you know it he made it in such a way that it would be something that they would even feel comfortable being around so it was Bluegrass and Rolling Hills and no doubt some streams and this and that and the other cuz they're not a disembodied spirit it's something that they would have felt at home with not streets of gold not palaces of of of gold and silver and you all the great foundations of the city with the apostles name he never mentioned nothing about sing that that's a little higher in the seventh Dimension but what was overwhelming was not the Landscapes it was not a beautiful the sky was Carol sister Sharon several years ago that overdosed her and some medication almost killed her she left her body in the hospital room she told her husband to tell Carol goodbye cuz they were so close and she left her body coming toward this light as she moves into that sphere the yellows she started seeing flowers the yellows and the blues and the oranges and the colors of what she saw she had never seen anything like it on Earth and her ability to view it and the light was brighter and brighter remember Isaiah prophesies that when the kingdom is reverted back the sun will be magnified seven times to what it is right now the sun lost an element of its Glory as did the moon as did the Stars when man fell so when the person moves into that realm Sharon was able to go and be gone for a bit and then come back she wrote it down actually told Carol about what she saw so it's a place that the Lord made for them to where they would be identified with something Earthly but yet Heavenly they couldn't identify with streets of gold they couldn't identify with Gates of pearl so it's a place that they're held but there's one thing that they will all have in common and that is they all had the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost was able to bring them to a state of maturity I received a letter from a brother in Belgium and they had certainly been a part of our church being bearing the burden for Eran praying for her and all and he told me of several people in his life that he had seeing them go and he felt prematurely one of them before he was even converted and he questioned God God why why why would you allow that man to go a young man and married and two small children why someone else in his life died the same question kept coming back why why happened for years and then there was a a particular person that had passed in his life and once again God why I don't understand why and the Lord spoke to him and said they so come into my image I wanted to bring them home was me my friends my sheep my children that have begotten to Christ I want to place before you today one of the view very few offers of perfection that you'll ever be given as your pastor I want to present to you today the offer of God's Own nature to where we can come into such an intensity of divine love that this world will not be able to hold us any longer and the temperance of love will grow and grow you believe whatever you wish to believe I personally believe that the elect of God reached that place before they ever go there are no supplemental classes or supplemental rooms that if you're lacking perfect love that when you leave here you're held in a Purgatory of sorts and then you grow into it you know the last few minutes before you go into the sixth Dimension you've actually arrived before you leave here I wonder if that's what it is about certain people that when we get around them we sense that something that's beyond them themselves and it makes us want to be like them I wonder if that's one by one as they're crossing over I wonder brother Joel if they're not attaining to that place and they need no supplemental character makeup they need no extra teaching on the other side you know there's a little a little forer there before the sixth Dimension and you get the last few things that you need when they leave here and they close their eyes hallelujah hallelujah so whatever you do lay aside everything else until you are just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you how many needs help this morning till you can love those not say you do do but actually love them so lay aside everything notice in the Ephesian Church age in 1960 Ephesus was not a deceived Church it failed Itself by not continuing in perfect love so you mean this has existed in human beings before remember this was the alpha bride so the alpha bride in the Ephesian Church age remember whenever it was written here that the church AE the prophet dated it from around 53 ad so that's when it began but yet we know the Holy Ghost fell in around 33 33 and A2 ad so what were they those 20 years prior to the beginning of the church age what were they it was bride age for those of you that are looking for the bride age to be something different that's ever been you need to reread your church age book it's only a repeating of those years that existed before the church ages ever started he was their everything he was their head he was their love he was their Alpha their Omega their beginning their end they gave their life for him they loved him more than they loved anything else and then a coldness begin to come in and then the church age starts and then we see that God said because you have left your first love so what was it before that time it was bride time you know people want to take the bride age in this end time and say that it's a number eight Oh no you're wrong there's only seven but it's at the very end of theeven seventh Church age there will be a reoccurring again or the Omega bride will be Anointed with the same anointing that was on the alpha bride what's it going to be more signs more wonders they had all of that it's going to be a love restored also back in our hearts that we're going to love him more than we love life itself we're going to love him more than we love money more than we love things more than we love mama if necessary more than we love Daddy if necessary because we will be anointed the beginning will anoint the end and the end will point back to the beginning and the alpha will be again in the last day in the Omega remember the prophet in the vision saw the bride appear twice when he tells that in the Masterpiece he wasn't even sure about the interpretation but the Lord God gave him the interpretation when he preached the Masterpiece and said it just come clear to me he said if you notice the bride she commend you twice because she is Alpha and Omega and if we're not careful we will focus only on the Supernatural part of love I'll tell you one thing friends you cannot get any more of God than to get his own nature that's good think of it in heaven there'll be no healing in heaven there will be no Miracles so which will be the priority healing the L the blind the halt or love do you understand one day we'll never have any more prayer lines Brothers we will never lay hands on people again so laying hands on people is not Eternal having a prayer line is not Eternal but perfect love is Lord God John says here in is our love made perfect and that we may have boldness in the day of judgment listen to these words because as he is so are we in this present world now right now brother yes sir so as he is not are going to be in the sixth Dimension now what's John captured by perfect love can I have a few more minutes notice this I'd rather have a church listen just a moment I'd rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift just be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church I realize there's an element of Brothers around the message that love to take this quote right here and try to say well bless God I'll tell you one thing the prophet said he'd rather have love than any of the gifts now what they're trying to do is take this one quote and make it seem as if though you don't need them but if they would have only read the latter part of the quote now that might be hard in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is gifts they'll fail where there is gifts they'll bring confusion Lord knows that's the truth where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect now let's not stop before we read these last few lines and if you had perfect love you would have perfect gifts now you see that did R them the same way that they did Paul and Paul in Hebrews of course or 1 Corinthians rather chapter 11 he goes to talking about the body chapter 12 he goes to talking about the gifts and then Paul tells him now covet earnestly the best gifts and I'll show unto you a more excellent way and of course chapter 13 but verse one he begins with faith hope and love charity all that you're familiar with it and then Brothers down through the centuries have done it they try to take chapter 133 and say as if though chapter 13 just knows and voids all the things that Paul said about the gifts why would he even took the time to write it Paul is not destroying the gifts but he's saying I'm showing you a more excellent way and the excellent way is if you get perfect love and then let God use you in the gifts these issues that I mentioned in chapter 12 will be taken care of because the more excellent way will be operated on Divine love and it will breed out gifts with margins of error oh my if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings yes I know some of y'all were absolutely scared to death of gift I don't know why it's just as much God's word as any other word of God well come on why in the world would God ever put him in the Bible if he didn't want somebody to manifest him in a right brother Donnie I've seen so much false so have I but that don't change God's word I've seen a lot of false preachers too but I sure don't stop believing in them I've seen a lot of false sheep I've seen a lot you sure you have but that don't make me stop believe I still believe it's God's word amen 1 Corinthians 13:4 four now here's the excellent way charity suffers long and His Kind charity Envy us not charity vaun us not itself now watch this is the excellent way which produces perfect gifts so charity a man with Charity in his heart does not look at himself and feel somehow he's Superior to other brothers praise the Lord does not behave itself unseemly I find this so odd and peculiar that Paul would said seeketh not and he uses the feminist gender seeketh not her on I mean I thought it was talking about Divine love I thought we was talking about God we are you see the real people of God are his attributes no sin so charity doesn't behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked amen boy amen say like K's teeth this morning man seek is not or own is not easily provoked thinkest no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity so if you hear so and so who had said something bad about you how a car wre I knew God had get him back it's amazing how that works to me if you have a car wreck the devil's trying to kill you if somebody you don't like has one the Lord's getting back at them if you get the flu the devil's trying to kill you and then you got Co on top of oh that old devil and somebody else you don't like get it glory to God I pray God and deal with them I think we need to be careful in how we delegate all this stuff thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth and if you notice Paul doesn't say part of it but it rejoices in the whole truth bow us all things believe us all things hope us all things endur us all things charity never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away it is your right to have perfect love not a put on not a show but to where every day hell is confounded by your action that Satan does everything he can to bring all these things against you now remember when you have perfect love all of these things you'll be Tried by so I want to warn you in advance this ain't for chickens and cowards it's for the elect so real love like this it doesn't mean you're a pushover now Jesus wasn't a pushover but he was able to pray for his enemies and love them not pray for him because the word tells him he had but pray for them with feeling praise the Lord you don't have to raise your hand on this if you don't want to but how many of you can pray for your enemies with feeling you have the same feeling for them that you do for your friends praise the lord well they treat me bad didn't speak to me over in a fellowship hall I'll get them back I won't speak to them your love ain't very intent yeah anger is if the prophet would have said thus sayith the Lord is going to take anger to walk down streets of go some of you would be shouting right now wouldn't you glory to God I'm got her made Hallelujah friends think of it we are talking about the introduction into a world the saints that have been going there now for some 2,000 years cuz remember they were never allowed to go there till after the cross so the cross purged man and brought him to a place where Paradise could be emptied out and shut down brought up into the to the next door to the seventh Dimension and what he saw was a mere glimpse of what heaven's going to be like heaven is going to be a world that might be surprising closer to this one than what you realize the prophet said it will be a continuation of this same life we will live we will eat we will drink we will Fellowship we will socialize amen I realize some folks they're antisocial you know they got about three or four friends and they don't want no more well I'll tell you one thing that ain't going to be the attitude in heaven well come on now some of y'all didn't like that did you well everybody there is going to love everybody else there and there won't be no little clicks you know you won't walk down Heaven Avenue in faith Boulevard and there'll be four or five little people just hi hi you can you always know when they're talking about you just by the look they got on their face you know and you know you've done called them and their FA is all rosy red and you know that you've done color there'll never be none of that there nobody will ever be SI D can you imagine them when the saints of God leave this world and they go by seed life into the theophany of God and they burst into that body they get their first glimpse of the Holy Ghost and it's perfection in a theophany because I was able to attain to it in a human body but the human body is so veiled its attributes from them I wonder if there's ever been a one of them with the Holy Ghost that crossed over these 2,000 years that said glory to God I've got perfect love Hallelujah I've got this and that and the other I wonder in reality how many of them thought oh I hope everything's okay oh God I need more God I need more Lord I want more oh Jesus help me help me help me Lord I Want More why could they say that because that Holy Ghost was still failed in this so all God does is take your jean and your portion of the Holy Ghost out of this coat this is what the prophet preached this body was and things that are to be an old coat so God takes your holy ghost out of the coat and your SE genene when the last breath is drawn that and your sophony meet together your SE gen and your portion of the Holy Ghost you imagine walking into yourself when you just step into yourself you stepped out of a coach here and you step into a new one there and all of a sudden your Holy Ghost and your C Gene looks with eyes that it's never seen through before with flesh that it's never seen before and it looks at itself and realizes I've arrived thank God I've arrived amen SP yet Hallelujah Lord Jesus I'd like for each of us from the front to the back up in the sound booths wherever you are today streaming at home maybe you can't couldn't be here today because of sickness or whatever may the Lord just help each other of us but we can look at ourself I don't want you to compare yourself to the Le of seeds because even a cold message believer looks better than they do but I want you to compare yourself to the mirror in the mirror of God's word so how do you treat those who have done you great damage and wrong is there anybody body you would want to see lost is there any mortal that you would want to see them perish is there anyone who is your friend or has been your friend and you honestly wish they would just die and get out of your face then my friend you need a greater Temperance of love and if you say you believe this message with all of your heart then I want to challenge you today with all of your doings with all of your seekings of this and that and the other seek this Temperance of love in your heart because you can't put this on I've set by the bedside side of many when they were fixing the crossover when you come to face and death you can't put it on you can't act it because you're coming face to face with the reality even for those that are lost Prophet tells us about the woman that all those years she believed she's okay until death struck her then her conscience are subconscious all of that come back to the reality and she said I'm lost and she looked to that Pastor which had preached to her lies and in her last dying moments she said you hypocrite I'll never forget I was told a Dream by someone years ago they dreamed about the regions of the the lost and they saw millions of people there screaming hollering crying and they saw this individual going into the regions of the lost and taking a hold of men by their lapel or their shirt type thing pulling them up looking at them and then throwing them back down Pull up another one throw them back down Pull up another one and in the dream the person asked someone standing by them what are they looking for what are they looking for The Voice answered back and said they're looking for that preacher that damned their soul to Hell by false Doctrine beyond the curtain of time they were looking for the prophet of God which had come to bring a message I don't know how you feel today but I love this message more than I ever have in my entire life I ain't tired of it I ain't sick of it I know a lot of folks are they're tired of it they're tired of hearing it preached well go right ahead but for me I love it more than I've ever loved it it's answering more questions than ever before for me I'm going to tell you one thing if you go to hell you can look all over hell but you ain't going to find me there cuz I ain't going to be there first of all and I am not going to preach you damnable lean Doctrine that'll damn your soul to the regions of the lost you may get mad at me sometime but I'm want to tell you the truth that the kind of man of God we want yes but what I want to ask you now is this how many of us all of us can we say Lord I need a greater Temperance of love I do I see it Jesus I do Lord I have a hard time with certain people Lord I've just got to be honest just be honest with him friends he knows anyway you can just be honest with him he honors our honesty praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord God thank you Lord Jesus heavenly father as we have our heads bowed I have my hands raised up today Jesus I need a greater degree of Your Love Lord I believe I have the Holy Ghost I believe I have your love in my soul I want it in a greater intensity lord it's sort of like a man and a woman and they meet and they start liking each other and the more they're with each other the more they feel for each other and then them feelings change from like into the first stages of love and then they love each other and then they decide they want to get married and they love each other the first year the second year on and on and on and they think I could never love her anymore but here Carol and I have been married for 50 years and I love her today more than I did that day we got married 50 years ago it's a deeper intensity of love I love you Lord Jesus more than I've ever loved you but I want to love you so much that your love will will reflect itself back out of me it's amazing to me men Carol will go into the store somewhere she'll be shopping looking for a dress for the girls or maybe something for our our daughter or for herself it happened yesterday she picked up a certain sweater I was down the rack maybe 8 or 10 feet from her I picked up the exact same one because we're thinking alike no doubt Lord your sons and your daughters before they get ready to leave this world they're getting closer and closer and closer to you and you just say you're so much like me I want to take you home but you know the sadness it leaves in our hearts so I pray you'd help those of us that are left behind Lord God father I desire more than anything in this world I don't want to be rich famous important I Want Your Love perfect love I've had people to lie on me I've had people to run me down all that sort of thing God but help me that I'll never have an attitude that I can always be like you and say father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing I don't want to do that because it's a scripture to quote I want to do it because the pulsation is so real from my soul I can feel it as if it was you because in reality it is you it's you and us fulfilling your word thank you Lord God can we stand our feet thank you Lord God thank you Lord God you see perfect love will anoint every heart so say some are given the gift of faith some are given the gift of tongues some would be given whatever types of gifts at what God would want to give them it would never be about themsel it would never be about people following them and them using the gift to try to get people to follow them but it would be about them trying to help with no selfish motive whatsoever in mind wouldn't that be an awesome church yes wouldn't that be an awesome church to be a part of I hope I live to see it I've seen gifts with mistakes preachers with great gifts to preach but yet you get around them and it's me and mine and I and me and this and that I get so sick of hearing that stuff and you just think Lord help us that we can lay aside all that we are and let perfect love okay so we're talking about Christmas time people buying gifts wanting gifts so brother Donnie what do you want for Christmas I just preached it to you I want it for Christmas New Year's Easter St Patrick's Day election day whatever other day there is friend so you understand it makes no difference how many people I pray for and God does miracles don't just get in your mind that I've had the supernatural in the last last eight or 10 years I've had the supernatural my Ministry ever since God called me to preach I've always had it I've seen phenomenal Miracles you wouldn't even believe if I told you that's wonderful do you understand AA Allen had such Miracles that was unbelievable Miracles Jack Co had them you you need to wake up a little bit and realize brother Brenham when the only one was Miracles right only one in time he said here we are with the anointed word and he said another man over there a trinitarian with the same Miracles and signs a Allen the lame would walk the blind would see the dumb would sing they had all kinds of stuff and a trinitarian we're not known by our signs alone but love they say John got so old Liv to be in his n he couldn't preach no more so they just pack him to church in a little stretcher type thing and he just rais up his hands and say love one another little children love one another love one another little children no wonder they called him the disciple of Love Brother John Michael wouldn't that be an awesome thing for you to be called a disciple of love what about a sis wouldn't that be awesome what about it young men wouldn't that be awesome to be called a disciple of love I talking about this ooey gooey stuff where you compromise I'm talking about you never compromise one word word but you love those that don't even believe what you tell them let's lay your hands on each other this morning if you would you're not praying for yourself now friends you understand this moment is between life and death how many people have embraced the knowledge of this message and will miss the Rapture I always say I feel so sorry for those that the first service after the Rapture takes place on the earth and there will be people that'll gather and message churches and the sad part about it is some of the pastors will show up because even though they say they preach the message their emphasis was selfish their emphasis was not on the full word but the Conant got Sidelines from one hangup to another oh children children if the Rapture takes place tomorrow Tuesday I hope and pray to God there ain't a one of you shows up for church on Wednesday night I hope every one of us are gone dear Jesus I began with me today search me help me is there anyone Lord that I would want to see lost is there anyone that I would want to not be allowed to go into heaven because I have some attitude toward them well some people wouldn't even want certain people to come here to our church because they have too big of a problem with them I don't know how in world they're ever going to go to heaven together I pray God should help us you come to seek and to save that which was lost Lord and if we have anyone that we would want to see lost let me show them how contrary that is to your nature for your word says it is not your will that any should perish so if we want anyone man woman boy or girl no matter how awful they've treated us if we would want anyone to be lost we are missing your will help me Jesus help me Jesus Lord God I've laid my hands on people in the middle of a heart attack right here at the med center and I've watched you stop it I've laid my hands on people with cancer laid my hands on people with cross eyes and watch you straighten them out I've seen so many signs wonders and miracles I thank you for every one of them but today I'm not asking you for a son not asking you for someone's eyes to be opened but I'm asking you take me and take these people into a deeper place of love than we've ever been before Hallelujah Lord Jesus baptize us so in the love of God oh Lord Jesus how can we say we're getting close to the change and can't even speak to one another how can we say we're getting close to being Rapture Ready and have alt in our hearts one against the other how can we help us Lord May the love of God May a baptism of the love of God so fall in our church oh we've got people screaming for Revival people praying for Revival some saying the Revival is going to be gifts some saying the Revival is going to be this Revelation that Revelation Lord God May our Revival be a Revival of Love of a love so deep for you and so deep for one another that if we get perfect love we'll have perfect gifts but if we seek the gift without the proper Foundation we will get a gift with a margin of error in it and then when we're caught wrong we'll make excuse and won't admit that we missed it I hear of tongues and interpretation that are going on and I find it so astounding that preachers want to spend all the time studying about the gifts using the message to prove that we need the gifts but then they won't use the same message to show how the prophet taught they should be operated stand up and speak in tongues and prophesying yeah the Lord say I'm here and I'm coming when the prophet said it should be something directly to an individual NE we believe what he said or we don't I choose to believe what he said amen I don't believe you're going to stand and repeat scripture what is it gifts or the margin of error out of the hearts of who sincere people that want a move of God but we're seeking the gifts without perfect love and if we can get that Foundation then the gifts that do come there won't be no Miss there won't be no wrong here well I guess I missed it I guess I was wrong there it'll produce Perfection amen praise be to God oh Jesus baptized Word of Life Church with such a refreshing of the Holy Ghost l oh it'll be awesome if we run it'll be awesome if we shout but Lord God what will even be more awesome than all of that is that we will come out of our baptism staggering under the power of God and find a depth of the love of God that we have only read about thank you Lord we will find ourselves living a life of deity hallelujah hallelujah We Worship You Jesus how many wants that with all your heart here sing something for us let's just worship together now oh children do you really want it yeah would you rather have just signs and wonders and miracles do you understand there'll never be one person lost never one person lost that has ever experienced perfect love there'll be those that have jumped and shouted and healed the sick and raised the dead and cast out devils and all that that will be lost but there'll never be one lost that's ever moved into this realm when you get here what did they tell the prophet when they said one to another when he got there when one person looked to the other and said think of it he's arrived he's arrived wouldn't it be awesome if that could be said about us after this service today some of you may not be that far away from perfect mature love till you finally enter that last stage and you're there remember there was some Believers in the first church age that had it they had it John was writing to some that had it perfect love thank God thank god let's worship a little bit got a little brother Nehemiah that wants to be baptized today if you'll come and we'll prepare for that let's just spend a little time in the presence of the Lord let him take his great MRI and his CT as it were look down in your soul let him give the report back of what he found you need more of me and less of you no no your love is not mature yet you're still really selfish you'll never tell nobody not even the pastor but you've got a problem if people clap more for somebody when they sing than they do for you you're a preacher and you've got a problem because you don't have as many open doors that's what this other man does brother Donnie you mean preachers tell you that yes I had one to come to me not long ago you know him well I won't mention his name but to tell me I have a problem with so and so and so and so and so and so because they get to preach more than I do they've got more doors than I do more people call him than I do you know what I realized the problem was the lack of doors was a lack of love oh yeah so if a preacher will build his ministry on perfect love and he may preach to 50 and you do believe it however you want to I admire men of God that have a small Church you realize there's men of God that will never in their entire Ministry preach to a Congregation of this this SI here this morning preach to 25 or 30 and they're as faithful to God as they can be oh they ain't nothing they are something too they're men of God and they many of will never be invited to preach a convention never stand before 5,000 people as I've been privileged to that don't mean they're a nobody that don't mean they're not important to God oh everybody needs to move away from them little churches and move to mega churches what are we talking about that's the way the world Saints God may have placed them there in that little church to be a light in their Community everybody ain't supposed to move to Word of Life Church everybody a't supposed to move to brother Tim PR or brother Ron Peterson or brother Ron Spencers they're supposed to be where God wants them to be and if God wants them to be there in that little church then let them stay in that little church we're not going to proelite nobody amen let's just sing together hey lead us God bless you Saints I love you remember if I never live to preach you another sermon with all of you're seeking and all that you're hunting for get perfect love it's your guarantee I believe seven or eight weeks ago whatever it's been now tomorrow night my little girl and I saw her breathing getting so heavy I believe she come to that spot she didn't cry she didn't scream she didn't beg God for Mercy when she took her last breath she was able to move Beyond this realm step into that place of perfect love I've got more to go to heaven for than I had three months ago I've got more after this sermon today to go to heaven for than I had yesterday I've got more to strive for Brother Don what can we do for you you all ask me this all the time but is there anything I could do brother is there anything I could do I'm going to tell you pray for me pray for me that I can have more of what I've preach to you today me if you've offered to BU me me and Carol vacations
