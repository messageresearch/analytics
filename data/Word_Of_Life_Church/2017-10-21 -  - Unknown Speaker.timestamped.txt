[40:54] laid on my heart okay and maybe to those
[40:57] that are unconverted this morning amen
[41:02] because this could be our last time
[41:06] amen this could be our last time you
[41:09] said what Trump's president my he's
[41:11] myself everything the prophets done said
[41:15] 1956 she said America we either accept
[41:17] God or reject God came back said she's
[41:20] rejecting God she's going to I don't
[41:22] care Trump
[41:23] whoever amen she's going down you know
[41:26] he may make it a little better for a
[41:28] little while but it's been prophesied
[41:31] and she's going down hey man I want to
[41:35] be found in Christ this morning Amos the
[41:38] fourth chapter the ninth verse said I
[41:41] have smitten you with blasting and
[41:44] mildew when your when your gardens and
[41:48] your vineyards and your fig trees and
[41:49] your olive trees increased the palmer
[41:52] worm divide them yet you have not
[41:56] returned to me unto me saith the Lord
[41:58] I have sinned among you the pestilent
[42:02] after the manner of Egypt your young men
[42:04] have uh slain with a sword
[42:06] and have taken away your horses and I've
[42:10] made the stink of your camps to come up
[42:12] into your nostrils yet you have not
[42:15] returned unto me saith the Lord I have
[42:19] overthrown some of you as God over the
[42:21] proves Sodom and Gomorrah and you were
[42:24] as a firebrand plucked out of the
[42:26] burning yet have you not returned into
[42:29] me saith the Lord therefore thus will I
[42:32] do unto thee O Israel and because I will
[42:35] do this unto thee prepare to meet thy
[42:40] God o Israel
[42:42] may the Lord that his blessings to the
[42:43] reading of the word you may be seated
[42:46] this morning amen
[42:53] so I was thinking about this I'm
[42:55] preparing to meet God and so you know we
[43:01] agree we prepare for a lot of things
[43:04] amen we prepare like me and brother
[43:06] Marquette to prepare this morning to get
[43:09] ready to come to the house of God you
[43:12] had to prepare Amen you wouldn't want to
[43:16] you know
[43:16] in here just you maybe just half dressed
[43:19] and all that but you you got prepared
[43:21] you got up maybe ate something brushed
[43:23] your teeth comb your hair to the shower

[44:13] hope they would prepare because you know
[44:16] that you wouldn't want them to come and

[44:20] preparing for that day and I wondered
[44:23] this morning it it mean you this morning

[44:45] though you might disagree with maybe his
[44:48] uh his policies as a is there is a is a
[44:53] is a you know politics and stuff like
[44:56] that he might disagree with him but it
[44:58] still would be an honor for him to come
[45:00] to your house you would prepare for him
[45:03] to come to your house he would maybe
[45:06] perhaps maybe hire somebody to clean it
[45:09] up real good and and all that because
[45:11] hey the president is coming to your
[45:14] house a man and so and today if it would
[45:20] be that a president Trump you know would
[45:23] come to our house to my house or do your
[45:26] house it would know you might disagree

[49:23] Pentecost what they used to be and he
[49:26] didn't shout and dance and speak in
[49:27] tongues you didn't have no service God
[49:30] wasn't there but we found out different
[49:33] in this hour that we're living in amen
[49:35] they've got so you know still waters
[49:36] they tell me runs deep sometimes it's to
[49:40] get into his presence brother Terry and
[49:43] just begin to lift your hands and make
[49:45] love to him and let him make love back
[49:47] to you Oh
[49:49] Oh hallelujah I hope I can do that today
[49:52] just to lift my hands and make love to
[49:55] and let him make love back to me hey man
[50:02] hey man you know the Israelites they
[50:06] often come together to bow down before
[50:09] their graven images
[50:11] hey man that's what the scripture tells
[50:14] us and they were professing to worship
[50:17] God they bowed down before their graven
[50:20] images professor worship to worship God
[50:24] amen but you know what they knew about
[50:27] true worship they knew what it took they
[50:30] knew how to approach God amen God had
[50:32] instructed them here that the prophet
[50:34] Moses how to come in how'd it go out and
[50:37] how to do that just like me and you
[50:38] today we know Church protocol we know
[50:41] how to come in we know how to go out but
[50:43] probably God said we ought to come to
[50:44] church 30 minutes early said there in
[50:46] the quietness amen read our Bible and
[50:48] pray to create that atmosphere and they
[50:53] knew how to come they knew how to create
[50:55] that atmosphere but many times it became
[51:01] a ritual tool amen
[51:03] and they just came anyway hey man do you
[51:08] remember what the prophet of God said
[51:09] Cain hey man when God said hey if you do
[51:12] as your brother you do well and Cain
[51:14] said here it is Lord you just take it or
[51:16] leave it and he left it
[51:17] I wonder what purpose we came for here's
[51:23] my worship Lord just take it or leave it
[51:25] you'll leave it and leave you without
[51:27] him god help us this morning
[51:31] we gotta prepare amen amen
[51:37] so they came and like I said they knew
[51:40] about true worship and how they should
[51:42] come hey man but they could not do it
[51:45] that way what about me and you this
[51:50] morning we know about like I said church
[51:53] protocol we know about true worship we
[51:56] know that the scripture says that the
[51:57] father secrets such that works of
[51:59] healing what in spirit and in truth
[52:02] amen we know about that but sometimes I
[52:05] wonder amen
[52:07] if we cannot do it that way hey man see
[52:11] they could not do it that way but they
[52:13] still went back home satisfied what
[52:17] about me and you we come here on Sunday
[52:20] morning we gathered our church on Sunday
[52:22] more Rhian brother mark our families I
[52:24] wonder what kind of attitude we come in
[52:26] they would come and say Lord just take
[52:28] it or leave it
[52:29] a man we know about true worship but
[52:34] probably God taught us about true
[52:36] worship we don't have to wait for the
[52:38] music to get pumped up hurry on the
[52:40] organ or her brother hurry on the organ
[52:42] or whoever we ought to come in here a
[52:44] man with our hands lift it up saying hey
[52:46] man speak to me Lord speak to the depth
[52:49] of my soul Lord amen then we come in and
[52:59] we do it that way and we leave satisfied
[53:03] because we think we but what we did it
[53:06] it just went through the motions amen oh
[53:09] my they had gone through all the rituals
[53:13] correctly they've done everything amen
[53:16] to the letter like me you do sometimes
[53:19] you know even you know and I don't know
[53:21] about y'all I know we don't sometimes
[53:23] sometimes we do but usually in most
[53:26] churches and whatever it don't matter
[53:27] however every Church is sovereign within
[53:30] itself
[53:30] hey man there ain't no dictatorship or
[53:32] lordship or don't bishop hey man don't
[53:34] tell you how to you should take
[53:36] communion all I know is the Bible says
[53:38] Jesus said Paul said when he wrote it
[53:40] how as off this you take this you do it
[53:43] under me did you know what that can
[53:44] become a ritual amen
[53:48] we should where's gonna be communion we
[53:50] were to make sure we love everybody if
[53:52] we made any mistakes we do you know what
[53:54] there's healing in communion I've know
[53:56] people that's received their healing
[53:58] during the protection of the Lord's
[54:00] Supper amen if we come right if we come
[54:03] prepared
[54:04] God to give us what we have needed
[54:06] [Applause]
[54:08] amen but it's left up to me and you we
[54:11] got to prepare a man we got to prepare
[54:16] all they've went through and we go
[54:18] through all that stuff correctly like
[54:20] they did and they were content what
[54:24] about me in here I wonder if we get
[54:26] content amen
[54:29] and just coming and going through the
[54:32] motions doing everything and thinking
[54:34] everything's all right
[54:35] amen all help us Lord hey man now God
[54:40] calls them to meeting now God calls them
[54:43] to meet them no longer to be satisfied
[54:46] with the visible and the external but
[54:49] get to the invisible and the eternal a
[54:52] man that's what I want to get nothing
[54:54] what we can see on the outside not the
[54:56] external but I want what about my soul
[54:59] ain't man down on the inside of the
[55:01] inside I don't just want it on my flesh
[55:06] cuz we can go to a ballgame and get
[55:08] happy in the flesh amen not just on my
[55:13] spirit amen

[55:17] know your mama died or whatever or this
[55:19] or that
[55:19] reasoning and all that you'll come to
[55:21] the altar but I wanted down on the
[55:24] inside of the inside that soul amen to
[55:27] where it'll make me live right it'll
[55:29] make me talk right it make me walk right
[55:31] it make me love one another it made me
[55:34] want to come to the house of God they
[55:36] make me want to raise my hands and give
[55:38] God glory

[1:17:11] you'll see an age worth the spirit
[1:17:14] what's lukewarmness ain't man he'd
[1:17:16] rather you make he'd rather he's got
[1:17:18] more respect for a cold person than
[1:17:20] lukewarm person he'd rather you'd be hot
[1:17:23] or cold but because you're lukewarm and
[1:17:25] the Bible even says that they put Christ
[1:17:27] on the outside of the church the only
[1:17:30] age that put him on the outside of the
[1:17:31] church and he was knocking trying to get
[1:17:33] back here but he's knocking and
[1:17:36] individuals doors this morning knocking
[1:17:38] amen and we'll just open up the door
[1:17:40] he'll come in and sup with us and we can
[1:17:43] sup with him amen
[1:17:49] what about backsliders here this morning
[1:17:52] would there be any here you know the
[1:17:55] Bible says he's married to the
[1:17:56] backslider hey man you had to have
[1:17:59] something in order to backslide a man oh
[1:18:03] my if you are here this morning maybe
[1:18:06] you've gone cold on God maybe your
[1:18:09] unconverted this morning but by you
[1:18:11] being here this morning shows me or
[1:18:13] tells me there may be a little something
[1:18:15] that God is working on you may be a
[1:18:19] backslider this morning but by being
[1:18:22] here in the presence of Almighty God
[1:18:25] this morning
[1:18:26] that's me to know there may still be a
[1:18:28] little something tugging in your heart
[1:18:30] to get right with God bring me back to
[1:18:33] where I used to be Lord bring me back to
[1:18:36] my first love bring me back to work I
[1:18:38] used to be Lord where you are number one
[1:18:41] Lord
[1:18:44] hey man oh if you are and you have that
[1:18:49] there must be something in your heart
[1:18:51] prepared to come back into his loving
[1:18:54] arms and be reconciled to him hey man
[1:18:58] let me look at three three points I'll
[1:19:01] try to hurry hey man
[1:19:03] number one I want to look at a challenge
[1:19:05] number two an invitation and number
[1:19:07] three of summons and I'll do it quickly
[1:19:10] hey man number one challenge it was
[1:19:13] posed he was punishing he punished the
[1:19:15] Israelites time and time again for their
[1:19:18] worship for their idols trying to bring
[1:19:20] them back to repentance but none of that
[1:19:22] had moved them amen none of that what
[1:19:26] about me and you the more God smoked
[1:19:28] them the harder they come like I said
[1:19:30] you know brother Brent said I'll go
[1:19:32] across the country and preach it come
[1:19:34] back they're worse than what they do I
[1:19:36] think about my pastor I think about
[1:19:37] brother Donny and all that hey man the
[1:19:39] harder they preach it seems like the
[1:19:40] harder but people become a man they
[1:19:43] don't want to be moved they don't want
[1:19:44] to be touched a man nothing you see
[1:19:46] ain't met old God amen so since she
[1:19:49] won't submit to him then he said I'll
[1:19:51] send my wrath upon you
[1:19:53] amen yeah I believe he's putting on a
[1:19:56] challenge this morning prepare to meet
[1:19:58] me amen amen Oh hope you heard it for a
[1:20:02] long time you've heard the gospel for a
[1:20:04] long time and you still reject it but I
[1:20:07] challenge you to meet me be prepared to
[1:20:09] meet me this morning hey man and do you
[1:20:15] still and do you hope if you're here
[1:20:17] this morning and I put out this
[1:20:18] challenge to you do you hope to meet God
[1:20:20] do you hope to stand or withstand God
[1:20:24] number one under this heading the
[1:20:27] challenge number one why do we justify
[1:20:29] ourselves to remain his enemy
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:34] well that's just my nature thus gadlin's
[1:20:38] we got that kind of a man if God saved
[1:20:40] you amen
[1:20:42] he'll bring that nature and the Holy
[1:20:43] Spirit I bring that nature under control
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:20:54] now I ain't gonna say that old man won't
[1:20:56] try to raise up and down then but we got
[1:20:57] the Holy Spirit amen and we're prepared
[1:21:00] to meet him it'll bring it back under
[1:21:01] subjection hey ho but you justify
[1:21:06] yourself well I would call so and so
[1:21:07] they didn't smile at me a man silane
[1:21:10] will come back to church no more the
[1:21:12] pastor didn't shake my hand but didn't
[1:21:14] say my favorite song so you're justified
[1:21:16] in remaining God's enemy then hey man
[1:21:23] you're justifying yourself a man or you
[1:21:29] finding a little quote a man that the
[1:21:32] Prophet said you know one place and
[1:21:35] somebody told me this one time
[1:21:37] said the angel the Lord told the Prophet
[1:21:40] not to have a television so I say you're
[1:21:45] justifying yourself so I'm saying you're
[1:21:47] more spiritual than the Prophet that
[1:21:54] means you can sit there and watch it and
[1:21:57] then come to church on Sunday morning
[1:21:59] and expect God to move but you justify
[1:22:05] yourself because you said the angel of
[1:22:07] the Lord told the probably didn't tell
[1:22:08] us
[1:22:09] but that prophet was an angel to this
[1:22:11] church age a man and he said to apply
[1:22:14] their token take the television out take
[1:22:16] the sword start out take the dirty
[1:22:18] magazines out
[1:22:20] [Applause]
[1:22:21] very man but we justify we get a quote
[1:22:24] and justify ourselves hey man oh but I
[1:22:31] want to ask you a question how much has
[1:22:33] he done for you how many of these you
[1:22:36] snatched out of a as a firebrand hey man
[1:22:40] I'll leave you hey man how many bees He
[1:22:42] healed hey man how many bees he saved
[1:22:46] how many of you filled you with the Holy
[1:22:47] Ghost Oh God that we are - we owe our
[1:22:50] life to him number two under this
[1:22:56] heading the challenge how many how long
[1:22:58] are you gonna resist him can you stand
[1:23:02] up against him when he comes at you and
[1:23:06] he says prepare to meet me and he comes
[1:23:08] at at you with a slore drone and that
[1:23:11] sort is none other than the Word of God
[1:23:13] not only the written word but the work
[1:23:16] for our hour are you going to resist him
[1:23:20] are we gonna be like David said in the
[1:23:23] Psalms we're like the shaft that the
[1:23:26] wind blows away they want to resist him
[1:23:31] hey man you know the property of God you
[1:23:35] know when he was praying for somebody
[1:23:37] many times he said that demon cancer is
[1:23:40] calling out for help but that other
[1:23:41] person has got it what about somebody
[1:23:44] that's resistant the Word of God then
[1:23:48] another spirit over here that's
[1:23:50] resisting the Word of God I'll call out
[1:23:52] for help from that other spirit that's
[1:23:53] resisting the Word of God amen but I
[1:23:56] want to preach a man and I hold brother
[1:23:58] Donnie and brother homer and brother
[1:24:00] Vince come brother Ted all them preach

[1:24:13] spiritually you know there I know though
[1:24:15] there that rig sitting there calling out
[1:24:16] for help
[1:24:17] I was going to resist what he's saying
[1:24:19] I'm gonna resist what the path I can
[1:24:20] really resist what the evangelists say
[1:24:22] though I know it's the Word of God amen
[1:24:27] amen
[1:24:31] you know Pharaoh couldn't stand up
[1:24:34] against him at the Red Sea he tried to
[1:24:38] resist him there was many people in the
[1:24:40] Bible that tried to stand up against God
[1:24:43] even Pilate said you know I got I had
[1:24:47] part of release she just said he ain't
[1:24:49] got no part at all and that's you're
[1:24:50] giving it to it by my father hallelujah

[1:24:57] angels and they come right now but he
[1:24:59] died for me and for you hey man all we
[1:25:05] got to count the cost and find out that
[1:25:08] we are prepared to resist him we better
[1:25:13] count the cause number three under the
[1:25:16] head and what about are you able to
[1:25:18] endure what he may lay upon you amen
[1:25:24] there's no telling you know sometimes
[1:25:27] brother Brent said we may have to get
[1:25:29] knocked down on our bed in order to look
[1:25:31] up amen oh I wonder hey man there's no
[1:25:37] hell you say some 14:1 says The Fool has
[1:25:41] said in his heart there is no God amen

[1:25:46] no God
[1:25:47] old are we prepared to go out and fight
[1:25:49] find it out but if neither these you can
[1:25:52] do you can't justify yourself you can't
[1:25:54] resist him you're not able to endure
[1:25:56] then I'll tell you what to do amen let

[1:29:46] David kneel at the cross hey man
[1:29:51] remember Billy Graham in his invitations
[1:29:54] but he ain't got no monopoly on that
[1:29:56] invitation just like the prophet of God
[1:29:58] to the Catholics didn't have no monopoly
[1:30:00] on the cross what did you use just as I
[1:30:03] am without one plea Amen just as I am
[1:30:07] Lord that's all that's all I'm bringing

[1:30:12] I'm nothing I know I was born in sin
[1:30:14] like David said strengthen iniquity come
[1:30:16] to the world speaking lies probably the
[1:30:18] first log we told was to get out of a

[1:30:38] flesh that can be touched
[1:30:39] then we'll be prepared to meet God you
[1:30:43] remember the great advantages Breton
[1:30:45] talked about him when she said we can't
[1:30:47] find the old record is it on the great
[1:30:49] adventurous hey man he said what there's
[1:30:52] one thing you can do you can appeal your
[1:30:53] case that the right throne he said I
[1:30:56] guess that's all I have to do
[1:30:57] he said he got darker and darker and
[1:30:59] darker then their great light and I
[1:31:00] don't think brother brems just told
[1:31:01] these stories just to feel well I got
[1:31:03] twenty minutes on the tape I might as
[1:31:04] well fill it up with no I believe he
[1:31:06] told it for a purpose and there he was
[1:31:08] the great adventurer stood before the
[1:31:10] God that white throne they said hey
[1:31:14] advance it so and so have you ever lied
[1:31:17] he's into that presence you better tell
[1:31:20] the truth
[1:31:22] he said ah I thought about he said yeah
[1:31:24] la have you always have you been good
[1:31:28] have you always been good know how
[1:31:29] heaven may be always wanted a god know
[1:31:35] Miniclip he said he's about ready to
[1:31:36] hear condemned depart for me but behind
[1:31:41] them he heard a voice sweeter than any
[1:31:42] mother's voice he said father advantages
[1:31:46] he stood for me here on earth said I'm
[1:31:48] gonna stand for him here oh god help me
[1:31:50] to stand for you lord help me Lord one
[1:31:54] more real quick a sermons a sermons you
[1:31:58] know you never know when that time comes
[1:32:02] there was many that left us last year
[1:32:06] some we didn't have no idea
[1:32:08] I sense ministers brother Terry and got
[1:32:14] that authority to tell people sometimes
[1:32:19] but the one that has that authority when
[1:32:22] he comes and said it's time and he takes
[1:32:26] your card off the rack you remember the
[1:32:28] prophet of God he got real upset kind of
[1:32:30] got mad at God about that woman that she
[1:32:34] uh you know prayed for she got worse
[1:32:38] than she died brother brems said God you
[1:32:40] owe me an explanation and then I think
[1:32:42] he had a dream or vision and God saw
[1:32:44] more she nearly drowned a year ago and
[1:32:46] said that was her time then but she
[1:32:47] wasn't right went to her mother and told
[1:32:50] her said yes I'll be bout a year ago
[1:32:51] rightness he said she nearly drowned
[1:32:53] it's a God forgive me just humbles
[1:32:56] forgive your stupid servant that's what
[1:32:57] he says a man said God you don't owe me
[1:32:59] nothing hey man oh god help me Lord help
[1:33:03] me to be prepared Lord we don't know
[1:33:05] like I said brother Louie said this
[1:33:07] could be our last service me and brother
[1:33:09] Mike don't know we'll get back to
[1:33:11] Alabama State for naught but one thing I
[1:33:15] do know I know who holds tomorrow and I
[1:33:17] know who holds my hand
[1:33:18] [Applause]
[1:33:20] Jeremiah said it like this the harvest
[1:33:23] is past the summers ended and we're
[1:33:25] still not saved brother Brown preach the
[1:33:29] message out of that why why you got the
[1:33:34] antidote
[1:33:36] you've got the inoculation you got the
[1:33:39] remedy why why if we all here die and go
[1:33:44] to hell every one of us in this bill it
[1:33:46] won't be brother Donny's fault it won't
[1:33:48] be God's fault we won't be brother
[1:33:50] homers fault but it be your father
[1:33:52] you're my father why because we didn't
[1:33:54] take the prescription that God oh yes I
[1:33:57] don't worry nothing I don't want to rely
[1:34:01] on my mama's experience I don't really
[1:34:03] want to rely on my pastor's experience I
[1:34:05] don't really rely on brother branham's
[1:34:07] experience but I want experience for God
[1:34:09] for myself I want to look to Jesus the
[1:34:16] Bible says there were five wise and five
[1:34:19] foolish a man and what they did not cry
[1:34:23] went out that behold the bridegroom
[1:34:24] cometh and they all rose up the five
[1:34:27] wise and the five foolish and both of
[1:34:29] them trimmed their lamps but the five
[1:34:31] foolish their lamps went out and they
[1:34:34] went to the warrant wise and say hey
[1:34:36] give us of your oil because our lamps
[1:34:38] have won out and you know what then
[1:34:40] watch this and listen we got barely
[1:34:42] enough for ourselves so what you need to
[1:34:44] go and get from them and buy from them
[1:34:47] that sells amen and where they went
[1:34:50] the Bible says the bridegroom come and
[1:34:52] took the five wise in and shut the door
[1:34:55] oh god what we live in a church what we
[1:34:58] live in at what we live in had prepare
[1:35:02] to meet God hey man oh you know what
[1:35:07] used to be one time a song you finally
[1:35:10] could took the time to pray you finally
[1:35:12] took the time to come to the house of
[1:35:14] God but she was too late because God
[1:35:17] came the day before and he was one day
[1:35:19] too late then me can I read you just a
[1:35:24] few quotes and we're gonna close now
[1:35:26] just give me five more minutes
[1:35:27] a man listen what he says he said and
[1:35:30] now he said and now mother you hear in
[1:35:32] the street
[1:35:32] and the dear loving person mother here
[1:35:34] and here all around over the building
[1:35:36] now I want to do tonight by God's help
[1:35:38] if you will to speak to his word to you
[1:35:40] then to prepare your heart for the
[1:35:41] healing service now I want you to listen
[1:35:43] close
[1:35:43] preparation God before he does anything
[1:35:45] he always prepares for it how could we
[1:35:47] as he spoke in the Bible before we go

[1:50:20] this is how far he is I take it is a
[1:50:27] precious time amen if you hear you're
[1:50:31] here for a purpose
[1:50:32] until we find that purpose there's no
[1:50:35] reason for being here and God knows the
[1:50:38] purpose it was in his mind before the
[1:50:40] foundation of the world just yield
[1:50:44] yourselves to him forget about all
[1:50:45] everybody else everything else and we
[1:50:49] like to look at and see what everybody
[1:50:51] else think about us but it don't matter
[1:50:54] what nobody else think about us this
[1:50:55] morning it only matters what the Lord
[1:50:58] think about us it don't matter how much
[1:51:01] money you got it don't matter what you
[1:51:04] possess it don't matter what you eat no
[1:51:06] whatever's taking place after service
[1:51:08] the only thing that matters what's
[1:51:10] happening right now just to be prepared
[1:51:15] for the homecoming storm as we bow our
[1:51:19] heads just let's look to the Lord Jesus
[1:51:21] Christ look within yourself you know
[1:51:24] where yet he asked Adam worth out of
[1:51:26] them but Adam knew who he was that he
[1:51:29] was in a fallen state at the moment but
[1:51:32] oh he had that bleeding bloody lamb and
[1:51:34] he he clothed them and and with that
[1:51:37] lamb around him as a perpetuation for
[1:51:39] their sins and we now have the Lord
[1:51:42] Jesus Christ the blood of God and I
[1:51:45] believe if we can take a DNA test this
[1:51:47] morning we would come up not
[1:51:49] ninety-eight percent not 99 percent but
[1:51:51] we'll be 100% sure that the same spirit
