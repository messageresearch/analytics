mind me feeling in the night I mean brother Jean taro had a conversation about a month or so ago about minister's brother Jean told me that he figured out bit who won any any of them any better than the other once that anointing comes on not totally but Jean you're right but you can wine still tastes good and stare fast air foam cup as it does in a crystal goblet so I hope y'all don't mind styrofoam tonight all right when when the ship is you have the same chef the steak tastes as good on China it does a paper plate so just pull the plastic off your sports and Willie if you have your Bibles within you will turn - with me - we're gonna bring to scriptures revelation three again and first John revelation three and twenty we're gonna read 20 and 21 and then first John five behold I stand at the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne brother Branham says bring this the scripture there in verse 21 does not literally mean to sit on God's throne Bramson that was to dwell in God's domain eternally first John 5 and 4 we'll read verses 4 and 5 excuse me for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus Christ is the son of God you can be seated I've had this thought for quite some time for over a year so I preached a message and I forgot where I think part of this message was from a message I preached here three years ago but I got the this the last year so this thought of what overcoming has really been on my heart and one reason is because I I want to overcome to the point where I can get out of here I want to to live a life of overcoming it to the point where Satan don't know what to do with me and that's what God is wanting from from each of us to look at the word overcome and the Greek it means to conquer to carry off the victory come off victorious of Christ victorious over all his foes of Christians that hold fast their faith even unto death against the power of their foes and temptations and persecutions when one is arraigned or goes to law to win the case maintain one's cause that's what overcoming is overcoming is it's not just getting up in the morning and reading your quotes to the devil every time he attacks you or throwing the scripture he knows those he knows him lay out of play I was saying church age in Chapter nine brother Bannerman wrote a quick look at these scriptures which involved the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in Matthew 4 wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that course bonded exactly to the temptation of the garden in the Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word fell to the personal Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan by following by failing to use the word Adam failing direct dose disobedience Adam went willing we do know that he was not deceived but he did go willingly but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way you can know if you're overcoming because that word can't fail in in taking this thought I got to you can't help but take the topic of overcoming and look at the life that we're living the age that we're living in the way the world is tor part where the government's corrupt and you see the issues going on in Ferguson it's it's not just how you say it's not just a black against police and all that it's it's it's a racial issue and Satan knows what he's doing when he stirs that but that's part of as a Christian as a member of the Bride overcoming in this age overcoming is you if you're a member of the bride most things that are happening there you're feeling that pressure that pressure is going to come it's gonna get more so ain't gonna stop there you know we got a taste of it at the first of the year by God's grace we made made it through but Satan is going to try on every hand as hard as he can to push you to a point where you feel like you can't overcome once he get you to the point that you feel that you're defeated he's got you because then when you start feeling like you've defeated you look for other ways other than the word to try to get out get past it so we look at the world today we look at the government's they're worthless Republican Democrat they're all corrupt you know it's been many years that we've seen a politician in the White House the Congress or the Senate that you just really felt like you know that man's a Christian you don't see that anymore it's because we know Satan's got his hand in that to look at our churches our schools kids are fighting battles now that we never dreamed what they would ever fight in this age right now your your child fought a harder battle and lay out to sea than you ever dreamed of fighting yeah and the only way for them to get through that is the Holy Ghost so as I said as I said before if your child comes to you wants to be baptized wants to accept the Lord as your Savior I encourage that especially in the in the and the life we're living and we see people following away or see people just leaving just leaving the word the only that I've thought and thought about that why would people leave something when you look at the way it feels to you the word this message it's everything I can't think of any single thing on the face of the earth not one single thing that you can think of in your life that you would trade for this work but you got people leaving it daily weekly monthly people leaving the work and I've thought about why would people leave something that has no no price its of no earthly value why would somebody and thinking of that and praying about that I got to thinking they were holding on to the message they were holding on with everything they had the only problem was the message wasn't holding them you couldn't hold on with your your own self-will your own strength that you have inside but as a human being yourself will only hold up for so long if you don't get that that that message down on the inside you're gonna lose your grip people are hanging on it's not that they come up with some new revelation when you leave this message God will not give you a new revelation that the message is wrong if he did he would not be God because he's changing his word so you got people that are just leaving for what reason they wanted to fit in if they could have found a way to steep still keep going to the word church a message church and fitting in out in the world they'd have done it but they couldn't stand the condemnation they were getting so they had to leave they couldn't overcome so how do we overcome how did Jesus overcome he said he that overcometh as even I overcame so how did Jesus overcome first we know by the word by giving in to the will of the Father and by dying that's how Jesus overcome sometimes we we go by the word we feel like we're overcoming by the word daily Satan comes against us we go the Scriptures we tell the devil the the the Bible said this the Bible said this brother Branham said this you're not telling him anything he don't know but are you giving it to the will of father sometimes that's too hard sometimes we never reach the dying part because we can't get past the will of the father there's things that God's will for you to do we don't want to go that way it goes against our nature and then we have to die out we have the word to defeat Satan but it's not quoting the word that will defeat the devil it's using the word in your life if you have the word in your life if it is sealed you have the Holy Ghost sealed in your soul you can't help you can't help to live the life as we last Sunday when brother Michael played the the video up there major Ian Thomas talking about how God in you it's he made the description of oil in a lamp the lamp is not going to work harder once you pour the oil in it the lamp is still just a lamp but gas in your car you pour the gas in your car if it's just sitting there it's still just a car the gas is what operates the car it's the gas being gas the oil being old it's God being God in your life he said let God be God functionally that means like God operate in your life so if we're letting God we're allowing God to operate in our life we've got no choice but the word the word to be lived out because it's not you living it you can overcome God never said for you when you come get up in the morning and and you face the devil and you attacking for a while and if you can't do it I'll take over for you beneath a god I'm already to quote here in a minute brother BAM said that God don't want you doing it he wants to do it himself hey if you if you're outside digging a ditch and somebody walks up says let me do that you gonna let them you're gonna let him do the digging that's what's God saying God saying let me do the dig and give me the shovel I'll do it for you when brother Brandon preached putting on the whole armor of God in 62 he said God makes himself present in his army that's us do you believe that now God said I sent him the word Eve just walked over the top of it disbelieved it I made it manifest and they crucified it I'm just getting tired I'm coming myself so here he come God in you God above us the pillar fire God with us in Jesus Christ God in us the Holy Spirit what is it the same word the same God amen no more trusting and anything else God come himself this was a man-sized job so he just brought it on down he come down himself they don't have to do anything about it just let them surrender to me I'll walk in them talking them speaking them working them oh my that's it I'll do the work just let them just humble themselves we know too much to humble ourselves we know too much to the word the oldest scripture went it says in the Bible says if it the brother having aught against you he come tell her sees you in a fault if you see a brother in a fault year to go to it well when you've got a brother or sister that's doing what the word says and going to see to somebody and they're saying brother sister you shouldn't be doing that and we take an attitude they're just doing the word if they're doing it right in love but we refuse to humble ourselves we can't humble ourselves we can't overcome that arrogance that we have because we know some what's more than anybody else that's pretty much goes with the same the truth hurts people don't like it when they telling the truth says I'll do the work just let them humble themselves let them just empty up I'll just beat my enemy out there through them that's what God is saying the enemy is coming answer he wants you to step aside let him use the armor and he'll defeat anything you have that's allowing you the scripture when putting on the you put on the whole armor of God are you trying to operate that armor are you trying to let God I'll finish that quote here well Bram says you can't do it yourself now you're no match for him but if you'll just let God do it get the word in you that'll all be taken care of it's the word that's taking action it's the word in you now that don't mean you stay home lay in your bed and say God will attack the day for me you've got to be a willing vessel you've got to be your in the fight whether you like it or not you were in the fight God didn't want us to face Satan on our own we've been told many times he's a worthy adversary how many times we tried to do it ourselves he just made a bigger mess everything but God will fight your battles look let's look at the armor that we're putting on what what kind of armor do we have vision 611 does put on the whole armor of God that we might be able to stand against the wiles of the devil so what is the armor first is truth truth definition of I went through the definitions of each of the six pieces of body armor their truth what is true and things pertaining to God and the duties of man truth is a personal excellence but that candor of mine which is free from affection pretense simulation falsehood and deceit truth lived out in you there's nothing false about there's nothing fake about it people can see in your life if you're walking in truth or not if you're living if the truth is living out in you second righteousness the state of him who has he ought to be righteousness the conditional condition acceptable to God you can't work righteousness up you can't be a there's no such thing as self-made righteousness there's self-righteous people but it's fake it's put on when I go through these we'll see how they all tie together in and they work together third piece of armour there's peace the tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ that's a peace your soul knows that your seal there's a salvation that's in you that's of Christ and nothing can take away faith a conviction or belief respecting man's relationship to God and divine things generally with the included idea of trust and holy fervor born of faith and joined with it it's saying here that it it it works with trust so when you're having faith in something you're having you're trusting God that your faith will bring it to pass salvation saving bringing salvation he who embodies this salvation through whom God is about to achieve it lastly is the word that which is or has been uttered by the living voice things spoken word which this particular word used in Ephesians is Rhema you can't use Rhema by itself we've heard hope series on riemann here this shouldn't be anything new to anybody you can't use Rhema by itself you can't take the word the written word down here when Satan comes against you you can't pull this up and say Satan right here it says now so not tempt the LORD thy God greater is He that is in me then than you he knows all that that's Rhema your you are quoting the word what are you adding to other pieces of armor with it are you adding the faith without the faith this word don't work without the piece it don't work without the truth it don't work without the righteousness it don't work so we're arming ourselves we quote James 4:7 all the time resist the devil and flee Fleming from you but do we forget the first part of that verse wonder why you people always say that resist the devil he'll flee from me resist the devil complete for me they're starting in the middle of a sentence and and quoting it how many knows what the first part of that sentence says submit yourselves to God then resist the devil and he will flee from you people get in their mind that resisting the devil is okay I'm not gonna do that I'm not gonna look at that I'm going I'm gonna put my hands over my head over my eyes resisting is having a desire a burning desire to do the totally opposite it's not going through rehab resisting the devil is not rehabilitation it's having an earthly desire to submit yourself to it's a eternal desire to submit yourself to God and do his will even if you resist even if you submit yourself to God he's gonna come back he's gonna punch you he's gonna hit you we get so we get so caught up and resisting we we forget that that was gonna fight back he's not gonna he's not gonna stop the first time you decide to resist him he's a worthy adversary he don't go down easy he's gonna come back and punch he knows your weak spots he knows where your weakness that never knows where you're living if he'd know he knows that your life is sealed and you're living with God working in you functionally say knows it part of this that I was studying on it was people getting comfortable in battle in the middle of overcoming they obviously it has a thing about it but it can law you to sleep it can make you feel comfortable it can make you feel like everything is okay there's more than one way that the devil can attack you devil will hit you and hit you and hit you or he'll back off when just low you to sleep and then you got people that are if you're comfortable and they obviously you're not fighting you're not fighting you you know you're not armed if you're comfortable if you if this world that you're living in does not make you want to leave you're not fighting you're not overcoming the things that you need to overcome to get out of here you say well I don't hardly have anything that I need to overcome return your ruler only thing he had to overcome was keeping up with the Joneses that's all he wanted keep up with the Joneses I want money I want to be rich you might not think that's nothing but it kept him out of heaven hard to cry out in desperation the bride's crying out in desperation to leave the true Bride of Christ is desperate to leave this world if you're not you need to check your salvation but we're crying out it's hard to cry out when you're comfortable it's hard to cry out when things are going good and it's not I was thinking the other day at work when you you know the internet everything is it's it's just crazy the things that's going in the world you know Thanks Russia stirring up and the things that's going over and the homeland and the cities with the the race issues that even if it's not happening in your hometown you've got to something is it gives you a greater desire to leave it ain't necessarily that is going on don't don't think that if it ain't going your hometown everything's good true bride feels that no matter where it's at but we become traditional Christians we get you know we walk over the sideline I fought for a while I'm going to sit down we've become traditional Christians Church becomes an event that is scheduled in the week it's another thing on our list to do we don't look at it as I'm going to go hear from God tonight we can't we can't overcome that a man and flesh is gonna stand on a platform I'm gonna read the quotes and tell us what it's all about that's the way we look at it we don't view it as I'm gonna hear from God we can't get past human flesh we've got too many things to do our mind is too occupied we say we love God we want to hear from God but somehow big orange keeps overcomes the desire to hear from God or your hunting whatever you want to do if you want to stay home watch your game go hunt go work so you can buy that new boat you don't have the true desire to overcome you don't have the true desire to hear from God you can say brother Joe let your own conviction know it's not that's the word anything you put before God is your God I'm you know I like there's things that I like I love to hunt I like football I don't you know I hope you don't condemn me for that I enjoy those things but I hope to god that I never have more of a desire to do anything more than hearing from my lord never if you would how can you mull around in your mind while you're sitting there deciding with you and go to church you're gonna kill that book that you know the neighbors gonna get if you don't get him how you gonna justify that what if what if you had you were dying what if you had cancer what if you had a financial decision to make in your life that was going to ruin you and God said I'll take care of that but I'm gonna go watch Notre Dame play football first we can't we can't separate our pleasures with God pleasure God's pleasures talking about overcoming you know when I look at my cell there's things in my life I have to overcome I'm not if right now I could tell you right now that I look at my life and it makes me sick sometimes when you look at your full life you go through the week and you think oh I shouldn't have done that or I shouldn't do this decisions that we make and they come back and bite you because you didn't seek the Lord for it we got it over we we got to overcome the fleshly desires I don't I don't mean to step when he told you like every you know when it comes to my heart I'm you know I won't apologize when we put on the whole armour of God when we put on all those six six things that I just read to you you are God in flesh God in flesh sometimes our our human minds cannot comprehend that we cannot understand how you say you are God in flesh it's God in you it's God's armor on you and God fighting your battles for you we can't we have a hard time adjusting to the armor maybe where God has one tailored fit to meet you for you young people he's got one tailor fit for your size the things that you go through at school peer pressure I know I talked I talked to my boys I know a lot of my boys friends you know things that some of them do it's totally unbelievable I go up there that pick pick him up practice and you got 15 year old 14 year old freshman walk out big dip spitting their daddy sitting beside him I can wear a ticket book out but you know I've teased him about that too but but look what they go with what they go through God wants to see a young person become God in flesh putting on the whole armor of God there's nothing you can't overcome the peer pressure don't matter you know you get look down because you you young ladies have long hair because you wear skirts because you don't wear makeup because you you bow your head and pray when you go to lunch one day you'll reap your reward one day wearing the armor of God will pay great dividends it's an honor to wear the armor of God there's a saying to be yourself don't try to be somebody else just be yourself because everybody else is taken so why would God why would God allow us tests and trials why would God let allow a young person testing trials why would they let him go through the things that good they go through nowadays because he trusts him with the armor he trusts us with his armor and the brother Brahim said God gives you a trial because he because he trusts you with it don't look at a couple gentlemen that you know in those scriptures here that had to overcome first one we want to look at his Joe keep in mind Joe did not have the Holy Ghost so why did Joe why did Satan choose Joe I've got my own opinion about that and this is not gospel and this is my own opinion everybody's got different opinions about everything I think I shared your brother Larry one day I've got my own opinion on why Satan chose Joe remember in the garden God said coke the devil told Satan the her seed would bruise bruises hit have that to them to seeds God hid that seed that natural see God hid it all the way coming up through Christ God hid that seed Satan's entire time this is my opinion Satan has looked for that seed ever since to destroy that seed and who but job could be that seed we know he wasn't but who but job could be that seed only the seed of God could be that perfect why else would God put a hedge around why else would God protect him so Satan comes to me he didn't even ask God for joke God just said hey you want him he does that to us you're on the mountain for two months and you're praying and reading and you're getting in church and the the Lord speaking the word to you you're feeling it you feel the growth and all sudden you get up Monday morning and you've been hit with something you never saw coming it happens God said have you considered my servant whis and got threw you under the bus by the West but isn't he does that all the time because he trusts you he knows your armor he knows your strengths he knows you can overcome he's not going to give a major battle major test as somebody that he can't trust with his armor he's gonna keep working on him till they get the armor on right so he goes to Joe we know we know those scriptures that talks about a job loved God sacrificed every day for his first children there was no fault in him God even said he's perfect not touji was perfect you're perfect Sayed was right over omen to and fro and he comes up to before God and God says hey how about Joe Satan said well you've got a hedge around him you won't let me do nothing so God offered the most perfect nail and facing the earth so but you can't take his life so Joe because hearts going through his trials his friends come tell him you've sinned you've done this I start lying to him basically you've done this you've done in JP Jobe knew he had but as Joel jabs trials kept going on and on Joe began to look at the good things that he done he began to look at the flowers the trees how come those how come when a tree dies it comes back how come when a flower dies it comes back began to look at himself I've done this what why would this happen to me we do that we throw our goodness back into God's face sometimes got those astrology and you think God look I've been doing good for for two months why would you give me this because you've been doing good for two months that's why you're going to get it you can't you can't be molded and shaped unless you're going through tests and trials and it's hard to do when God throws you a trial it's hard to rejoice it's hard to start praising God and say thank you Lord for this trial because it's not what you want but it's what you need my Paul said I rejoice in my infirmities my glory in my tribulations so as joke goes on Joe how many Nobel Bram said job wrongly accused God Marie quote from God's provided way keep in mind joke did not sin but Bram said he did not sin the Bible says he did not sin God's provided way there was a profit that's right there was a profit back there he didn't know just exactly what the will of God was for him he waited he didn't know what to do so the first thing you know when everything seemed to go wrong his comforters wouldn't comfort him then God was under obligation down from the east came a little fellow Elihu Ella he stood to him said now look we put it in childlike form job said now look I see the trees when they die they live again the flowers when they die they live again but man lay it down he has to give up the ghost he wastes it the way his sons come to honor him but where is he someone job's mine when I die I'm done I'm not coming back Joe hadn't had a revelation yet shortly hereafter he gets a revelation he couldn't overcome his own intellect his own thought and in his mind I died I'm done I'm never coming back there he didn't have her he didn't see the resurrection yet he said he has to give up the ghost he wasted the way his sons come to honor him but where is he oh that thou would hide me in the grave and so forth Ellie who said now wait joke by the banks out like this wait job you're accusing got wrong now that flower hasn't sinned God has a provided way for that flower to live again and then we go on in God asking Joe where were you and I laid the foundation of the world before I laid it when the sons of God sang together and the morning star shouted for joy I gave brother Terry this quote you are my witness he's my twin died about two years ago to preach on it he ain't done it so I decided to use so Jobe and Jones mine when I die I'm finished it's over there's no resurrection I'm not coming back but where do I go beginning and ending of the Gentile disposition brother Brandon 55 brother Graham said see we come out of eternity we was before there was a world as you know that God made man in his own image where was you he said to Joe when Jobe thought he had some wisdom said that where were you when I laid the foundation of the world before I laid when the sons of God sing together and the morning star shouted for joy you might wonder why I'm going off on a tangent here but I'll come back to overcoming in a minute the morning star shouted for joy never shot anyone shouted for joy when they seen that someday through a tabernacle here on earth the King Melchizedek would come back in the righteousness of God give his life to redeem us to God back again and outshine the Stars forever and ever so looking at this The Shining ones shouted for joy because why because they were seeing that Melchizedek would come back in body and Tabernacle himself in human flesh and the lives of those he tabernacled himself in without shine them stars forever and ever that's a true overcomer but it don't in their spiritual amnesia Bela Bram said we don't want not to be a true Christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him I'm identified with him notice he was in him notice then every Christian that's a real genuine Christian was with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal realms with God ten million years before the world was ever formed I was back there with him if I got eternal life now I was there with him I was identified with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy who were those sons of God shouted for joy how many was there brother Branham I was telling brother Bradley for service this that particular quote that I gave brother to brother Terry I had used it in a sermon I think up in New York or something but it really after I get with you brother Terry I wondered why I gave it to him because he took it and I had to hunt it back up and and it just ate at me and hated me and there's I think there's something in there that I couldn't and I had a question and a 90's brother Donny about it and I came to church I was telling a vow that came to church and this is what he preached on this point right here adoption number 260 so beautifully displayed in the prodigal son I was lost this is my son he was lost and now he's found he was dead he's alive again bring forth the fatted calf the best robe or ring put it on his finger no wonder when the morning stars saying together in the sons of God shouted for joy when they seen the plan of salvation God putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world brother Donnie right dad just some come over me I saw my name wrote down I don't remember it but that's why shouted I shouted around the throne of God you shouted around the throne of God how could not you not rejoice over that you realize what you're doing when you come to church Saturday Sunday and Wednesday God is jogging your memory trying to get you to remember what you saw before the foundation of the world thank you [Applause] cerfancy bud Brandt said he's praying this is how he opened it this is how he actually open serpents 1858 dear God the great and mighty God who formed all things by the power of his Spirit has brought Jesus Christ His only begotten Son who freely died for we sinners the just for the unjust to reconcile us back into this marvelous fellowship that we have again with God we are taught in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that there wasn't the same time that the lamb was slain that when God is great thinking seeing us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through Jesus Christ you stop and think a minute what were you shouting for what were you rejoice in brother Branham said was because you've seen the plan of salvation and here is Joe all depressed I'm dying I'm not coming back so God says Joe where were you what God knew that joke didn't know God knew that joke was one of those around the throne shouting and rejoicing because before the foundation of the world job seen the plan of salvation he didn't remember it brother Branham said in the breech the God handed drove binoculars and let job look four thousand years ahead and saw the crucifixion saw the resurrection and after after God jog job's memory job said I know my redeemer liveth so how can we overcome no we can overcome in this age because before the foundation of the world God revealed to you that you would overcome and Laodicea when you saw the plan of salvation before the foundation of the world you can overcome by representation of your theophany you already knew that you would overcome and here you come every service and God's jogging your memory and you remembering a little bit at a time you remembering a little bit at a time and overcoming power get stronger the more your memories job the more that comes back to you and brother Branham was preaching on them with spiritual amnesia your memory starts coming back you start you don't remember you being around the throne but God's jogging your memory this is what the plan of salvation is that is Christ living in you putting on the whole armor of God and conquering and lay up see young people let me tell you you can overcome by representation if you have the Holy Ghost sealed in yourself every time you come in here and you sit down you pay attention to the word you pray you read God's jogging your memory you're going to see how you can overcome because you already saw it before the foundation of the world another gentleman we want to look at a dear brother brother John you might not see how John the Revelator would tie in to overcoming but but they've solid was up here preaching one day and I had already had this thought and it's been about six months ago he was up here preaching part on John it just hit me when John I'm if you can't turn to Revelation 5 1 through 4 and we'll read that what every parts of that scripture there revelation 5 chapter 1 I mean chapter 5 first 1 through 4 and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book to loose the seals thereof no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon if he you were John was caught up in the spirit had the Holy Ghost and it been revealed to him that no one was worthy what that meant was all creation was lost John was lost everybody was lost so do you think John had any overcome the power at that time right there he didn't have any he was in the spirit had the holy ghost and caught up in the spirit and felt defeated because all was lost but man sitting the breach when you and John looked John didn't see the line because lamb wasn't there yet the lamb wasn't there brother Branham told us where the land was that said we went back into the eternities to make intercession for all those sacrifices to the Old Testament he was giving overcoming power to all those that were living under the bull the blood of bulls and goats making good their sacrifices without that lamb Abel was lost without that lamb David was lost they was all lost but God rich in mercy because I go back and pick him back up John didn't seem the brand said then he came out through glory through the Fontan through the throne revelation 5 verse 5 through 7 one of the elders said unto me we've not behold behold means to turn the eyes to gaze upon behold turning your eyes gaze upon the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book to loose the seals thereof now John could have stayed in his depressed state and not look just said yeah okay and in his mind there's a lion behind him but the voice told him to behold it to look at it so he said I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth and to all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne WAM had to take the book the lamb hadn't taken the book our names wouldn't been revealed John's names wouldn't been revealed we're gonna jump down to verse 13 if you will I'll hurry and every creature which one is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such hour in the sea in all them therein that pretty much means everywhere heard I sang blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and to the lamb forevermore John was not just rejoicing because the book was open John was glad for that but that is not what gave John overcoming power the same thing that gave John overcoming power can give you overcoming power if you see your name in that book John rejoiced because he saw his name in the book we can read in the breech brother Branham said what a Jubilee going on in heaven when the lamb bleeds that leaves that intercessory box to come here to possess his claim you know what got next to John he must have saw his name wrote there when them seals broke he must have got real happy listen what he said he said every creature which is in heaven and on earth underneath the earth such her in the sea and all that in them is he in them hurting me saying blessing honor glory power to him that sits upon the throne to the lamb forever a man and a man and a man and the four beasts said a man and the four and twenty elders fell down and worship Him that lives for ever and ever so when I would say John at that point he didn't care what they did to him he had a revelation of where he was who he was and where he was going when you get to that point to me out when I look at that God was showing John again this is what I showed you before the foundation of the world John brother Branham said John was showing the plan of salvation talk about a Jubilee talk about a time when that lamb walked forth see the books even sealed in heaven the mysteries say is my name there I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world and the first thing that represented a trip represented that Redemption come to Lamb and had been slain before the foundation of the world he took the book glory opened the book tore off the seals set it down to earth to seven things revealed to his people there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujah is the anointed the power the glory the manifestation and Oh John when he was standing there a brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in earth and everything to see heard me holler amen blessings honor and power my power to him that lives forever and ever talk about a time when them seals broke John must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there's John oh he was so happy everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't he everything in heaven everything in earth everything beneath the earth every creature and everything else heard me saying Amen blessings and glory and wisdom and power and might and riches belong to him amen John saw my name I have no doubt my name is on that book if I doubted it I wouldn't be here tonight I wouldn't be wasting y'all time but I believe it with everything was in me and I know begun a shot of a doubt before the foundation of the world I was rejoicing because I see my name that's what makes me an overcomer I know I had represent representation before the foundation of the world I was shouting for me I was shouting for my salvation what have I got to lose I've already been there and I'm going back if your if you were there before by representation if you were there if your name was there there's no way it's totally impossible for you to lose true you're gonna you're gonna be armed you got the armor on you got the whole armor on Satan knows you there that having the armor on his nothing keep Satan from attacking you and if I can stress this if he's attacking you he got you if Satan is attacking young people he sees you have value you take anything that God holds valuable but the way I look at it to me I hope you know that I can take that revelation that God gave me when I was studying this and black the devil's eye as hard as I can there's nothing to stop you if you were there before the foundation of the world there's nothing on this earth can stop you nothing it's impossible that's totally impossible that's about as impossible is the word impossible I guess but how many overcomers well let's stand together [Applause] I've got everything here to lose and on the other side of got everything to gain I don't want to be here anymore I'm tired of getting up and fighting every day fighting every day it's a fight the fights are gonna get harder if you're the bride the fights gonna get harder in it I'm tired of fight I hate this place if I've ever hated thing in my life I hate this place that I live I have prayed fervently beg God Lord let me awake in the morning in a new wife I don't want to be here no more I hate this place with everything godly that is in me when you look at it you look at the things that are happening you look at the the timepiece of Israel you look at Russia Russia's moving the reading of the day they're moving a whole convoy back into Ukraine which is gonna stir a lot of trouble and you look at the the rights issues everybody's gay rights and civil rights and all that it's all it's all there to cost contention that's all it's for it's it's as part of Satan's plan cause contention to mess with your mind to make you reason to make you wonder where you're at but we've heard for years you know the gates are in sight the gates are right there we're closer now closer now than we ever thought we we sing that song I'm running my last mile home I'm running my last hundred yards that's how close how believe it is I had we have to run we're in a race the bride would run hardest when she's in the straight this trade away when she can see the finish line and that's when the bride they fight the hardest or run the hardest will overcome the most when she's in in the straightaway I had to I had hired a coach to work with my oldest for football and he would have him and other boys he was training they would run to hit the 250 it's 250 yards around the track you'd have to go around to terms and he would stay on the others he would stand at the finish line I would stand beside him and he would tell Gabe he said Gabe go and me being the father I would look at my son I would look at him running I'd hi the father would tell the coach hingle make his time with that pace and he would yell at him Gabe you better pick it up pick it up a little bit but he wouldn't make his time after about two or three months I standing at the finish line watching I thought he might beat his table he keeps that pace Gabe you keep that pace you'll beat your time the father would tell the coach and the coach would tell the son when he would come around the last stretch he would yell at him run Gabe run that's when he would run his hardest that's when he would overcome his tongue he would have his buddies standing at the in line yelling for him go Gabe Rudd yeah we're in the same kind of race when you come around that turn there's nothing left but the finish line your terms are gone your turns are behind you your loved ones are sent in to finish line and every service you come in here the father has already talked to coach the coach is coming up here telling you run little bride run you've got a hundred yards left that's all you got left why would you jog now why would you step off the track and sit down why would you listen to the opponent that wants you not to make your time I'm gonna win this race I'm gonna win this race with everything that's within me and I'm gonna beat my time and I want to step into eternity if that ain't your goal you need to rethink you need to find out what your goals are are you gonna win are you gonna be nice and let the other guy beat you I'm in this for me there's there's no I don't want second place I don't want second place hey if you go to glory before me I'll still have first place I'm still the winner no matter we're all winners because we're one body let's bow our heads I've never done this before I've been preaching about five or six years I've never yet done this but if you look at your life you say brother Joe there's things in my life I can't overcome I can look at mine and I can say that there's things that I could change in my life there's things that I could add to this armor I can tighten this armor up some but you look at your life and you say brother Joe I need strength I don't matter if you got the Holy Ghost you're not Satan's taking his punches there's sin we all do you want to come pray I'll pray with your better Terry brother jeans bill arrest these guys would pray with you did you say brother Joe I want to overcome I don't want to be here anymore I don't want to live a life and layout of see it as a half way overcoming I don't I'm gonna have battles but I want to win him I wanted I want to give in to the will the Father that's my desire because if I know if I'm giving my life to the will the father it's impossible for me to lose it's impossible I'll resist the devil he will flee from me but first I'm gonna submit myself to God as we pray of send me I want to come pray I'll pray with you Heavenly Father lord I thank you so much for this message that you gave me Lord Lord has burned on my heart for a long time the Lord just the revelation though in there knowing that I can overcome because before the foundation of the

John was rejoicing over me Lord I like to think that the joy that ever the whole earth heard wasn't partly on my account Lord I got things in my life father I want to tighten this armor up I want to
