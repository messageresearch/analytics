amen Lord you've been so good to us Heavenly Father we want to thank you oh I'm sure that there's countless of blessings that you give to us daily weekly monthly yearly that we're not even aware of the times you spared Our Lives when the devil thought he had us Lord times whenever we made a a turn to the right hand we was going down the road and we knew better than that we knew to turn left but somehow we turned right and missed our turn and got straightened back out and got down the road and there was a terrible car wreck if we would have made the left hand turn we've been right in the middle of it amen you watch over us Jesus yes we're so thankful for it Lord God as we come together again tonight we're just so happy to be able to have church again oh Father what a great privilege

at home we know that but there's just something about us getting together each one bringing their little lick of fire oh God we just count it such a privilege I cannot imagine what it will be like

because we serve a mighty God and you're a God of Miracles so if there's people here tonight that need Miracles May our faith rise to that place because you are a god of the miraculous amen Grant it tonight we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus amen praise the Lord God bless you let's uh turn tonight if you would to Matthew chapter 16 again I want to say while you're turning there that Carol I wanted to say how much we appreciated the uh youth choir several of them and even several adults showed up at our house on Sunday night uh to sing for us and it was just absolutely beautiful they just done such an awesome job and we wanted to thank them um brother Rob and uh the adults that came with him and drove and it was just so so nice you could just so sense the presence of God as they did that I want to thank y'all for doing that God bless you Matthew chapter 16 verse Verse 18 and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I'd like to make sure that the devil understands that we believe this is the infallible word of God right so I'd like to read this part again Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so sloot you are fighting a losing battle 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 14 now I want you to listen carefully to uh verse 14 and verse 15 because it's it's quite profound the words that Paul uses listen to this carefully now these things write on unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly now remember this is actually written to Timothy but if I T long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the House of God which is the Church of the Living God I want you to think first century ad probably by now this is written 6566 ad they still for the most part did not actually have church buildings that's why the Bible does not give requirements for the office of Trustees do you ever think about that there's no biblical requirements or anything that talks about a trustee because they never had property they never own property thank God for the message which comes and tell us what the trustees do what they should do should not do so on and so on why the church gained property in around the second the latter half of the second century so whenever they talked about church in the first century they never thought about a building what they s about was the mystical body that would gather they would gather at rich people's houses John wrote about it I'll give you little spec of History here John wrote about it and he said that there was people that was coming in and he said they were spots in your Feast of Charity now they call them love Feast so what they would do the rich people that'd have a big house and they'd move the furniture out and they would just kind of put seats out there there so they would have church they would preach they would sing they would pray for the sick all that they did and then after they done that these rich people would feed all the church people so they called them love feast or charity Feast so the rich people did it so this was their church so when you read this in the New Testament and in the and of course the book of Acts and on through don't think about a church building because whenever they read this they would look at one another other and say well this is the church now listen how Paul identifies what the true church is how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God look at this word church Ecclesia an assembly a gathering of citizens called out from their home homes into some public place so they were called out of their homes wow so you mean they didn't believe in staying home and just reading the prophet's books you see to be identified as a church one of the signs you were the church were was that you left your home to go somewhere where the saints were gathered together right now how in the world people think they can be able to fulfill the word of God and stay at the house and say I don't even need no preacher you need the Holy Ghost is what you need first cuz the prophet said if you get the love of God in your heart you cannot wait till them Church doors open back there and he said if you don't I'll tell you what it's time you got to pray in well praise the Lord a gathering of citizens called out from their homes into some sub public place or an assembly in a Christian sense Now watch how this has a dual meaning in a Christian sense an assembly of Christians gathered for worship in a religious meeting so the building itself was not called the church now we call the name of this place Word of Life Church many of our churches around the message are evening light Tabernacle and this Tabernacle Faith Tabernacle and Living Word Tabernacle and Tabernacle and church and Tabernacle but that's not the way they related to it in the first century they did not call a building a church they call the people the church now notice as Paul goes on with this he says that you know how to behave yourself in the house of God the mystical gathering in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God notice what else he says which is almost just it's overwhelming the pillar and ground of the truth so you mean the church is actually what gives the truth it's substrate or substructure under it and the church is what keeps the truce from dying now if we believe the Bible this is what your Bible says let's read it together now which is the Church of the Living God the pillar the pillar and ground of the truth look at this word ground a stay a prop or a support Now does not the truth support us yes but in this sense it is actually the church that supports the truth so if you were the devil what would you want to destroy would not you want to destroy the columns the stay the support of the truth which is what the church oh my which is the pillar and ground of the truth may the Lord bless his word you may be seated so the real true church the Ecclesia of God is the way God looks at this and if you'll look at this word in your Greek Lexicon it will have a Greek name there and then a a number and it will reflect to you that this is also the same antitype of when Solomon built his Temple and Solomon in the front of the structure Solomon had two pillars or two columns and he gave them names and they were a support in the main structure or the body of the house of God now Paul borrows from that and says now what supports the truth and what will keep the truth alive is the Ecclesia of God now not a church building not church membership but actually the elect of God so you can see why then Satan would do everything he could do do to try to stop the Church of the Living God the truth listen carefully so you don't miss understand me the truth is not self supporting the truth is not the foundation for itself the truth is not self propagating so we could take our Bibles our books we could lay them right here on this Pulpit lay it on your chair where you sat lay it on the piano lay it on the altar rail we could leave it there for 500 years for a thousand years and we would never come back and find that the truth had built another pull pit or that the truth had built another altar rail or another piano or that the truce had actually replicated itself and made another Bible because it has to have God orchestrated it this way that it must have human instrumentality to carry that seed word and the seed passes through the body right so it's not then that we can just now handing out tracks is good and handing out books yes absolutely we should do that with all of our heart but your Bible don't have legs on its own and it does not have a mouth on its own our message books do not have books or legs rather on the books they do not have hands on the books to where they can hand theirself out they don't have a mouse on the books to where the books fall into the hands of the people and then the books go to explaining themsel and telling them this is why you need to read me this is why you need to open this up they don't have that ability so so what is the support of the truth the pillar of the truth the Church of the Living God now let me ask you this what was it that came first in the apostolic age the written New Testament or the Ecclesia now if you know history very well you know that one of the very first books they say that was written was the book of First Corinthians which was 59 ad the Book of James was written around uh 6059 latter part of 59 to the early part of 60 so you mean from 33 a until we'll say 59 so for all of those years 26 years they did not have a new testament there was no Book of Mark Matthew Mark none of them John uh book of Acts there was none of them so God started the church actually the Ecclesia and then God started having the New Testament written why he needed a big foundation to lay that book on and he needed support why would you build a house in a in a in a mud hole why would you build a house with no support God did not want to build it upon just the Old Testament alone but what is he going to build it on the doctrine and the teaching of the Apostles and the prophets merge together so then what is God going to do God's going to let the book of Acts of course come into action but what did they preach now they preached Jesus and they preached it from an Old Testament perspective but remember many of the New Testament uh preachers for those years did not even have the Book of Matthew Mark Luke and John acts none of those to be able to take their text from so what did they proe preach they preached Jesus they preached healing they preached Miracles and they preached it from the types of the Old Testament and was they doing the work of God absolutely doing the work of God and yet they didn't even have a new testament to be able to stand up say now let's everybody turn to the book of Acts tonight let's everybody turn to the Book of Matthew there was no such a thing and yet God started out his church in that fashion that he would build it upon now not only the doctrine but also the actions of these Apostles so they're not what the world probably would call Great theologians and learned men but they were men that had this testimony and that the world knew them by this identification that they had been with Jesus now they might not have stood there and but able to have all the types I imagine that Peter and them whenever Paul be to write the types of the old Testament and bring it right on to the book of Hebrews that Peter and James and some of those Jewish Brethren they must have thought wow what an understanding this man has we don't have no no history or anything that Peter ever even tied the priesthood of the levitical order to the Lord Jesus he never mentioned it in the sense the way that Paul did now he referred to him as being a priest and said the little things here and there but can you imagine if the Lord Jesus would have chosen Peter to be the the church age messenger of the Ephesian age it would have been so little that God would have had to reveal himself through now we've got great men in this message great men and we've been privileged in our church to be able to have some great Servants of God to be able to stand here and preach the word but as great as those are there's not a one of them that has the capability to become the light the eye which allows the light to come into the embodiment of the horn in order to illuminate the body for its purpose on the earth now brother Tim prud is a great preacher my he's got the identification of being Prince among preachers but I am so glad that brother Tim is not the church A's messenger because we would be so limited and what we know cuz you know what brother Tim gets what he preaches from the messenger himself because brother Tim is like me he's not made to where that his first conscience and his subconscious is the same which makes him where God can project to him infallable Revelations that cannot be questioned now does he get inspiration from God yep just like me and every other minister but you see a prophet is different from that that's why when God anoints the lips of a prophet and they speak thus sayeth the Lord that is totally in infallable well somebody say Amen because that's the way God made them I'm not made that way I can have a dream and remember part of it and comes and goes but a prophet is made to where his subconscious and his first conscience are so close together that he can his eyes can be wide open and he can enter into that realm and God can take their lips and their mind and speak prophetic things for thousands of years down the road and that's the way God projects to them the infallibility of thus sayeth the Lord there ain't nobody else made that way so God is going to now build an establish and he's going to have a church upon this church he will be able to reproduce it over and over again he knows in the Ephesian Church age they will become cold and indifferent and they will lose part of that original love that they had when they first started out now God is going to show John that in the types now remember remember many of the New Testament preachers never even got to read the book of Revelation it was completed between 95 and 96 ad so some of them first century preachers that started preaching around 33 ad some of them were totally dead gone in the in the sixth Dimension with the Lord they never even got to hold the New Testament in their hands they never knew nothing about seven Thunders they never knew nothing about seven Church ages and God kept it secret until he called John and to the aisle of patmas and there he revealed it to him so God is going to actually backtrack a little bit in the Revelation chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 and he's going to take John backwards a little bit to where the church age started because John didn't even know of course that there had been a church age none of them even mention it Paul never mentioned nothing about a church age but yet it started around you know a few years after Pentecost 20 something years after Pentecost but they were already in it but they didn't know it so they were experiencing the cess of the church age but they hadn't actually put a time slot that said it's going to start at this certain certain year but they knew there was a difference in the church somehow and then when God called John and he allows him to be caught up into the presence of God and he goes to showing him manifestations part of them would coincide with the Book of Daniel part of them would coincide with the book of Zachariah and he would see things that would be very similar and yet he would see things that would be altogether new now remember a prophet is what God chooses to be able to show them things that are not actually written in the word now I know there's some of the message people what me said this way they claim they are message people but they have a problem was that and they they really don't accept brother brandham as the same caliber of pro Prophet that Paul was they kind of believe brother brandham was a guy that you know he he could be able to write a commentary well I'm going to tell you one thing if that's what you believe about Malachi 4 you better get a revelation quick if you plan on going in the Rapture you ain't going to take no Rapture by reading some commentary William Brandon was not a commentator he was a Vindicated prophet of God oh brother Donnie people don't like you to say that I don't care if they like it or not I'm going to say it as long as I've got breath and I'm in my right mind I ain't ashamed of this message I ain't ashamed of this Prophet come on somebody it's going to be this message that's going to bring us rapturing Faith to get us out of this world we're living in so God had to bring John to this great spot and he shows John the symbols of the things that's going to happen now let's pick this up here in the samran church age and this is in the church age book page 156 and every age we have exactly the same pattern this is why the light comes some through some god-given messenger in a certain area then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught now listen to the pattern that God will call some man through an area and then the light of God will come through that man it will come from him down to the ministry of others and then they will begin to spread the same light but now notice what happens but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken now what happens in time is that preachers begin to think they know so much and they know so much about God and they know so much about their Bible and they've studied Greek and Hebrew and whatever more and they feel like that brother Brandon was you know just a little bit back woodsy and he was Kian and you know brother Brandon wasn't educated and he wasn't very smart and and all of that and now that they're so smart that they know more about it than he did so they really don't think it necessary uh to to run their ideas through the message no more that's why we get all these wild haired brain ideas that preachers stand in a pull pit and preach something that a that a coup of chicken shouldn't listen to much less sheep well Hallelujah but now notice they don't always learn is it amazing they can learn this and learn that and learn something else but they don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken remember Paul warned the people to say only what he said in 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let acknowledge the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord now remember Paul said things in the New Testament that neither Peter James or John nor Moses nor Jeremiah nor Zachariah nor Hagi nor Malachi nor any of the rest of the prophets ever said now some of the people around the message to death that lived in the first century that have treated just like to do our Prophet right now well brother brandom I'll say Amen to that if you've got a scripture for it don't you understand a prophet of God catches the unwritten word oh I know some people don't believe it I know some message preachers that don't because I've got emails from them right uhhuh their old hide needs to be exposed to now what so he said what came the word of God out from you or came it from you only that add here or take away there soon the message is no longer pure well I don't think we need that do you I I I don't think we need that well you know brother brandham almost said it this way and he didn't but man he should have and and since he didn't I I we'll just go ahead and say it uhhuh now notice what happens they add here take away there soon the message is no longer pure and what happens the Revival dies down and then they go to wondering what's wrong what's wrong with our churches what's wrong oh well well maybe maybe we need to update maybe we need to modernize maybe we need to modernize our music maybe we need to bring in uh some outside speakers out outside of the message and maybe we need to get uh you know um five love languages and and we need to get these books and add these books to our library you know because this PhD and this this guy you know brother Ram actually never dealt with this and dealt with that and that and and then everybody needs to start tuning in to doc Dr Dobson and and we need to get this Theologian and this guy here and that guy there and and we know you know our churches are needing something or needing something and we go to looking outside of our ranks we don't need to look outside of our ranks what we need to do is look and see what we've added and what we've left out while we have killed our own Revival I'm going to go ahead and say it tonight we're not going to have no Brides Revival by mixing 1906 version of Pentecost him with this message oh I know it's stirring Folks up all everywhere whenever you say that but it's a truth why would God lead us backwards why would God lead us with a message of Malachi 4 and take us back to the isusa street emphasis I ain't talking Brother D don't you believe in Pentecost I do but there are two dispensations or or time frames that are called by that same name and we've got to be more care careful than any generation that's ever been on the earth cuz if we're not careful we're going to hybridize the original with the one which came last and will not even recognize what the true is because it becomes so modeled and so mixed together come on church Preach with me tonight do we want the original if we want the original we've got to go back to the original seed word if we want a 1906 look what it produced what did it produce oh my by the time the prophet got here there was everything of the world imaginable that was going on in the restoration of the gift move and will you want to go back to that alone I don't I want everything God's got for me I want everything don't you but I sure don't want to go backwards to get it I'm pressing on the upward way oh my notice this how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God Paul warned them to say what he said now you see the tape people want to take this quote right here and say uhhuh see right there you read it right there tonight so all you need to do is listen to the tapes I do and whenever I listen to him I hear him saying we need men of God out there to get behind the pull pit and preach the word and then I do what he said on the tapes and then I get crucified for doing what he said on the tapes that they say they believe you set on the tapes and I say no you don't no you get you a good Holy Ghost F Pastor come on somebody inste of one you can control by your remote you can pick out which tape you want you can stop it you can start it you can fast forward it if you don't want to listen to this one you select you another one but a holy ghost filled man of God don't come of the remote that you fast forward or rewind him skip that Brother D no he's anointed of the Holy Ghost he cuts you he cuts himself he cuts the deacons he CS the trustees why because he's LED of the Holy Ghost oh my goodness praise the Lord Paul warned them to say what he said even as Peter did likewise he warned that even Paul could not change the word that he was given by Revelation oh how important it is to hear the voice of God by way of his Messengers plural and then say what has been given to them to say to the churches is now we'll go to Revelation 5:8 and we'll come to a symbol notice chap verse 6 rather I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven what seven horns and seven eyes so here was seven horns on the head of the lamb and then in each horn was an eye now which are the seven spirits of God sent forths into all the Earth so this is seven not that God has seven holy ghosts but seven manifestations of the same spirit of God Church age dispensations so the horn represented the body the church the Ecclesia of God the eye is what catches the light now it was formerly believed by medical people that actually the eye itself caught or produced the light that allowed it to emit into the back of the brain and as you know when it hits it and it's upside down then it changes around but actually the light itself the eye does not produce the light but the eye allows the light to be emitted and enter into the body now watch here in the breach the prophet tells the seven horns was the seven churches the seven churches because that was the Lamb's protection now notice so this horn as you would know saying on a cow or a deer or whatever more you know the deer you brothers that's been out hunting and you'll you'll watch them and them deer will get into fights and oh my I've seen them it's just incredible some of the things that they will do but them bucks will not stand up there and take their paw so much they'll rare up every around them but for the most part what they're using is their horns and they find them all the time to where two bucks will get all caught up and inter twine with one another and one of those bucks will absolutely kill the other one and that one will die and their horns are locked and they can't get it off so he will actually pull that other dead Buck around some of you Brothers have seen it no doubt and until that carcass is rotten or somebody sees it and helps him get undone because the horns are their protection so God now takes this symbol of course Daniel sees the same thing on the goat and he uses this as a symbol to show that the body is his protection this is Christ support work in every age now this is how God identifies the bride and every age the church as a horn so he uses the horn on himself to Ram the devil well I'll tell you one thing if I'm going to ram him we don't need to be made out of marshmallows do we if we are a bunch of marshmallow Christians Jesus ain't got much protection in this hour if we're a bunch of compromising layer Deans well we ain't going to preach Holiness and we ain't going to say this and that and the other brother Donnie we've got a new church we got new people coming in all the time I told you before we ever come here if you thought I was going to compromise because we was going to stop having visitors you got the wrong preacher this may be the very thing they're looking for in the first place why would you want me to preach the same thing they're hearing at their church we need to preach the word of God for the hour that we are living in this is our dispensation I am not going back and preaching the 1906 version I am not I've already preached that years ago and it did not satisfy me then and it's SW tonight but what do I want I want want to hold up the standard of the Lord God in the last days under the eagle anointing of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 1-7 and tell you we are the generation that is going to take the Rapture it's not another generation I don't believe it's a hundred years away I believe we are near that time remember that last beast power was a flying eagle not a setting [Music] one I wonder if had it right but have got the salvation of her boys if she' have sat there and good brother but brother random told her you said the right thing just to think it wouldn't have done it notice I love this the seven Church ages because that was the Lamb's protection don't you see his support work his support work on the church this is what the lamb protects his with what he protected his rights with on Earth my Lord boy I'll tell you I don't know about you I feel pretty flimsy with that I can understand cherubims in heaven Zoom seraphim and he don't have Angels down here no actually he's got something better right you ready he's got something better Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah or if you familiar with your Prophet saying it he said who has the most Authority in heaven an angel or a son of God hallelujah he could have placed cherubim he placed them down there at the Garden Gate but he BR Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden he placed them Angels there and it was to protect the way back to the tree of life but after man become converted and filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and receive divine nature in his soul then he said cherub take a back seat sarap take a backseat I'm going to turn myself I am going to lay my head in the lap of my bride she will not trim off my hair the way Delilah did Samson I'm going to put my rights in the lap of my sweetheart because I know she will protect me with every drop of her blood she will lay aside if she has to her mama her daddy she will protect take me I feel safe I feel secure because I am in the arms of my beloved back off devil back off because my bride will protect me in every age and let me tell you she [Applause] has so the anointing projects from the lamb moves up and begin to energize the horn and the horn goes you're introducing whirling into the church now with my mouth my horns you can't see them but I got a horn up here that's what you are a horn men of God that's what we are we've got to stand for what's right the lamb anoints us protect my rights protect my Holiness in my people protect my Purity protect my [Applause] message hallelujah what he protected his rights on Earth was a godsent listen to this group of people that's protected not just preachers not just a prophet but a group seven eyes of the seven messengers of the seven Church ages seven eyes seven Sears now let's look at it from this angle Matthew chapter 6 verse 22 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single notice this now if thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light I want you to notice now Jesus did not say that the eye produces the light but the eye is a channel by which the light can pass through white cannot penetrate so much the hand the ears the brain the hair but where is it here the eyes so the eyes allows the Rays of light to be emitted into the body now notice how Jesus says it the light of the whole body then is the eye so the entrance of light you can't eat it you can't swallow light you can't taste light you can't hear light right you can't feel it but you see it you see light so then your eyes are you know even the great cameras that they have M they're constantly making them better and better and better with all the megapixels and all this and that and the other but they said they have never yet been able to make a camera that will even compare to the human eye and yet the ability of all the millions of pixels and colors and all that's there and Jesus chose this as a spiritual symbol let to bring it over now into the eyes in the seven horns so here we got the eyes so there was a church AE messenger and there was a church so here was a bent of the church and then there was an eye in that horn so the eye would catch the Light Of God being emitted for the day and then the eye itself was an open channel to pass what was emitted through the eye down into the body and as long as that light stayed there from the eye the light that was in the body oh it made the body pure and it made the body holy now I'm talking about spiritual light because that light Paul caught that first church age Revelation and the light come from God and it went back through that prophet and it come right down through the body they had gifts they had teaching they had miraculous they had all the word right they just wasn't one-sided you know well go to God all we have our church is just preaching we don't believe in those Supernatural Well that's not Apostolic well all we have at our church is prayer lines and signs and wonders and miracles well that ain't Apostolic either but they had all of that together why because it was all determined by the eye you follow me so far so the eye in that age now whether it is a flashlight or whether it's the brilliant lights away we have up here whatever it is the eye itself will be able to adapt and you know how it is whenever you're in the dark and you're trying to find your way around the least little bit of light can help you move around but you also know how difficult it is if you walk out of this building tonight and you start out in the darkness you can't hardly see where you are going because you are walking out of great light into darkness and that's what happens to people when they walk away from this word and they leave this brilliant light of the end time and then they get out of here walking away from L they can't see nothing they get to a place they don't know what's right no more is this right is this wrong I don't know what to do well it ain't no wonder it's because they pulled out from under the influence of the eye of the age Oh Glory notice and so the light of the body is the eye Jesus says if therefore it is thy I be single or focused on one thing now notice what a prophet messenger does and I want you to see in this symbol that there was not five or six eyes on one horn and there was no double vision up there either there was only one eye per horn now watch this this is why myself I am not looking for a prophet to come after Malachi 4 and say something to the Gentiles right amen there ain't no Malachi 4 five and a half come on somebody I am not looking for somebody to come and perform the sign of the Messiah that has already been done well glory to God I'm not waiting for some man around the message to come and everybody in the bride is going to follow him there is no such promise in the word of God Amen there was only one eye on there and then that eye didn't fall off and a new eye come up you're breaking your types oh my so the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light so the the the eye is what allows the light to come true as I said it comes back and Strikes the back of cornea turns it upside down switches the image just like that instantaneously to where you can be able to pick up images then your life has the ability and God made it in such a wonderful way you those of you that have your eyes testing you have to have your eyes dilated you know what that is of course and whatever they dilate your eyes and then whenever you walk out in broad daylight with full sun ain't that fun I mean your pupil is about the size of an Indian head nickel and you're walking out I mean you're just about blinded why because your eyes are fully dilated which is what they're supposed to be in the darkness come on now and God made your pupil so it would get small and big and it would adjust according to the amount of light that you are dealing with is that right so we walk out from this bright building tonight the size of our pupils are going to be one size we walk straight out that door into the darkness they going to be another side and we're not going to be able to say anything but if we stay out there long enough our eyes will begin to adjust and we get used to the darkness and then we think this is what we're supposed to do come on children let's not turn away from this light because it's possible for you to walk away from the light and you stay in a compromised situation or a darkness of the world and before long your eyes will become so adjusted you'll think well this is normal I guess this is what we're supposed to do oh my you see light is admitted listen admitted through the eye and then it illuminates so Jesus then in this next verse he says that if your eye is single then the whole body is full of light but then he says if a person had an evil eye which that word there is also diseased you see this is what's happened to every age that people replace the eye of the messenger that God put on the horn and then they get a man most always a man with a diseased vision and then they put him in that godall position but the problem is God didn't God don't change his eyes he changes his ages now can you imagine as I said earlier replace in Paul with Peter so now let's take the eye out we're going to take it out Serge we're going to remove it we're going to lay Paul the prophet over here and we're going to put Peter in now Peter was a great man L God but that man could not hold Paul a light that's right in understanding in Revelation in Mysteries you can go ahead and say Amen right well let's look James let's take Paul out and we'll put James in James hardly ever left Jerusalem James was still very Jewish yeah James never did really see the purging of the Gentiles and the merging in show me where James ever caught the revelation of the Jews in the first century and the merging together of the Gentiles to be one body we wouldn't even have that scripture if Paul hadn't wrote it so you see God chose the man that he wanted to be the eye and then God makes that man and gifts that man was what he needs for the age now God knew he did not need to put Paul down there in the Luther age but where he needed it was at the beginning if God would have started out with Luther at the beginning then in the restoration the last days would have to be restored to be all Lutheran cuz what whatever he started out with is what he's going to end up with now if God wanted it to be the 1906 version of Pentecost then God should have used that instead of the acts two version brother Melvin is that right so then we could come back and say praise God we're going back to isusa Street glory to God we're going back to isusa Street amen the Lord is restoring us back but that was not what he used first what he used first was the anointing in of the lion and had Paul to speak out and begin to bring great Revelations which had never been uttered since the foundation of the world and whenever he be to preach and God opened his understanding it was not for him just personally but the illumination was coming and shining through that eye listen friends it's still shining today it's still ongoing when you and I read his writing ing by the spirit of God you understand what I'm saying we're still seeing things that this man wrote that's how profound that it is but notice this Jesus when he says this the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single now the word here single is devoted to one object that's not tunnel vision and it's not confusion so you're not looking at this and well we got society and you know we've got to worry about pleasing these people and we've got to do that but your eye is single it's on one goal and that one goal the most important goal of course is pleasing the Lord then work family job occupation you know all that sort of thing everything else comes after that single Vision remember those eyes were not doubles they were not triplets they were not quadruplets there was one one and that I would be so single on the purpose of God can you imagine if God would have sent brother brandom in the days of Martin Luther and he would have walked up on that that day whittenberg Germany and wrote that 95 thesis I'm not sure brother brandom could even spell the word thesis I'm not making fun of him now God allowed him to be that way for this day to confound the smart and mainly the smart elic that's right you've seen some of his notes back in the library right if you haven't you need to look at them they're trading them out every now and then so you can see them the man couldn't even spell words properly that's right some of our brothers from South Africa were here a few months ago and first time they'd ever seen many of those things and they were just taking pictures and they were just in awe at brother brand notes and how that he wrote and many of our our our school kids would be able to spell better than he did and he's saying why in the world can you imagine how those Ed educated theologians sitting behind brother Brandon when he's preaching all those great things and if they would have saw his notes and said you got to be kidding me you got to be kidding me this is Elijah this is look look this man spelling why don't have his nouns and his pronouns right and he don't have this right and that right that's exactly what God wanted to confound this age God could have chose a theologian had he wanted to God could have chose another Paul if he wanted to a man that spoke several languages a man that had a great intellect but God said no I don't think so I don't think I'll call him from California where Newsome's going to come from I don't think I'm going to call him from Washington DC I don't think I'll call him from the mighty Mississippi I think I'll call him from down the middle of Kentucky I think I'll get him down there and nobody will know his name his mom and his daddy will be nobody's his grandparents will be nobody and I will call him I will raise him up I will give him a Ministry that he will pray for monarchs and kings and potentates come on somebody why because God chooses the eye we [Applause] don't you see the eye is single so it's not a denomination so now denomination I mean you'd have several rows of eyes on that one horn you know the big eyes of course and the little you that'd be eyes all over that thing I mean there' be the head guy and the second guy and the third guy and the fourth guy and the fifth guy there be eyes everywhere all around that thing I'll tell you one thing brotherr we had this meeting and we've decided that Donnie Reagan and them guys that preaching and holding s we're kicking them out of that church good luck with that pal we ain't got no board here over us that tells us you can't preach Holiness and you can't preach this and you can't preach that come on children but what did God say I want one eye and through that one eye I will project my light the light will flow through him down through the entire body and the body will become Anointed with the same Spirit he's under praise God and that will be the message of the hour and I will use them to ram my way through Darkness I will use them and I will push and push and push through Catholicism I'll push through presbyterianism I'll push through Church of God ISM I will push until I push my bride right into the gates of paradise I will protect myself with my [Applause] body you see the eyes designates also clearness of perception clearness of perception several years ago I had a lasc surgey many you know what that is had a stigmatism in both of my eyes and uh tried to wear glasses first you can imagine me with glasses I just never could find a pair with windshield wipers cuz I sweated so much I just fog up could see where I was coming or going then I went to contacts and I look I'd come off you on a big drunk every time i' preach because I'd sweat so much sweat get behind my eyes so somebody told me about that lasic thing I thought well I'm going to go check it out so I went and got that done I was making two trips to China and they wanted to do one before and one after so I laid down on that thing and they sta me down some of you've had it Carol was standing outside there and in a room where she could see and had a monitor and they strapped your head down they pour drops in there and then they got this machine that goes like that and what they just did was they cut my cornea just like that my head can't move now I'm wide awake and then they take a laser beam and they go to reshaping my cornea with a laser now I don't see it but I smell something it was my cornea being burned and reshaped by laser which is a form of light so if ever now and then when you're in our church and you go to smelling a funny smell it could be your hide being reshaped by the by the light of God's word hallelujah now I I just found that so amazing and I I lay there and then they come back and they take a little thing and you know put this back over and your eye is the fastest healing part of your body I if you knew that or not but it heals where they cut that in a matter of seconds and then they let me get up well before I get up there's a clock right on the wall and whenever I laid down on that that was the last thing that I saw before they start doing all this stuff to me and I couldn't even read the clock but as soon as they done that and they put that flat back over and they reshaped it and all that and I looked and I'm laying flat on my back and it's loed here in front of me and immediately I could tell what time it was oh yeah I could tell what time it was I could tell what age I was living I could tell by the signs of the time I could look and see now I laid there before and I could not see it but they glory to God glory to God they reshape the way the light struck my cornea and allow it to hit the same eyeball and what I could not make out before I could make out in a few minutes after so you see it's the same way when we get under the anointing of the eye of the age that oh I don't understand that I can't say that I can't say that and you're just sting there saying glory to God I see it glory to God I see it and your mom and daddy is saying Lord have mercy they're in a cult watch them don't drink none of that red Kool-Aid I'm noticing he's been drinking them colored drinks watch it oh my well I'm the only one that drinks if it's going to kill anybody it's going to be me not you so what happens the spirit of God goes to reshaping and then what we thought was three gods and then the light goes and we say glory to God glory to God it ain't like this at all it's true like that oh my I can see the time I can see the age I can see the hour We're living and others saying what what I don't I don't see anything oh it's just like it's been said for thousands of years where is the sign of his coming where is the sign and you're saying you got to be kidding me it's all around us everywhere well they got denominational stigmatism they got denominational blindness and they tore out the light of the age and they stuck some preacher up on the ch said now I'll tell you one thing we don't need to be all excited now after all we're having the lighting of the Christmas tree in the church on Sunday and we're passing out gifts everybody will get a carton of cigarettes and what wine is your favorite wine that you love to drink don't sit there and look at me funny some of y'all used to drinking smoke and bear running out of your mouth now you got slobber running out of your mouth where you're eating on this good Clover you see this is why people look at the same thing you look at they say I just don't see it I just don't see it now they corrected my eyes this way this one is 2020 this one is 2025 that so they did that on purpose that's so whenever I read a book or I read small writing my eyes can be able to adjust when I sit down with my laptop in my lap my brain switches on my eyes and I will sit there for several hours at a time and I'll read and then when I get up it takes me a little bit from my eyes to adjust and the Domin eye to come back in to the preeminent part Ronald Reagan had that surgery done as well now then whenever I'm there my brain switches between it and then I can see five but when I sit back down again to be able to read my laptop it takes my brain or my head the control tower to be able to adjust my vision to where I can see where I need to go aren't you glad you got a control tower in your soul that helps you sometimes you're looking out there you just don't understand what's going on anybody ever get there you don't know what in the world's going on you don't know what you just done you don't know what's so and so done and you don't know what to do but give your head Christ Jesus a little bit of time there and he'll adjust your vision where you can tell what's going on by that I don't have to have readers so I can still read tiny writing on the side of this bottle which is really good because sometimes the mystery of God is hid in tiny letters oh yeah so if you've got to have a 24 you know I'm tell you one thing you're going to completely Overlook what God is doing in this hour so God didn't send us double vision God didn't send us a man with quadruple Vision but he sent us a man Whose desire was that people would fall in love with the Lord Jesus his one desire that he might establish a relationship between God and man did brother brandom ever build a bridge after him did he build a church oh my and all of us say we are now the brand denomination was there a building a college a school a graduation place where we send all of our kids to what did he leave us a desire that we would be like Jesus Christ that he could oh what a a great thing it would be if the prophet of God were able to visit around the world and see the churches that are still under the anointing of the eye of Malachi 4 and see them doing the same work that was done in the book of Acts but what people want to do is reach up here take that eye out and put a pastor's eye in and I'll tell you one thing Brethren I think these prayer lines are Pentecostal these people screaming and hollering and shouting Lord have mercy God ain't deaf and he ain't nervous either do you honestly believe my little darling daughter that steep beyond the curtain of time has found her a chair and been set there for the last eight weeks just looking around how y'all Ain this wonderful I'm wondering if she's even slowed down or not praise God scream and holler our precious brother you imagine all the saints she's already met praise be to God but whenever people listen it's not always a denomination system and the message but it's the same spirit and people are scared to death of a multitude of men you don't take a multitude of men to warp your vision all it takes is one that's right and that one does an eye surgery and it goes in there and it cuts out now brother Ram said this but I you know I mean that that was in the 50s and the 60s you know I mean we we could really can't apply that in this day how you going to apply what Isaiah said 2200 years before the 50s and the 60s so they take that eye out now they lay over here in they research they still keep it in their study but they just don't preach it no more you said Brother D why do you keep saying that because you'd be surprised at how much is going on in our ranks then they put what a pastor's eye can you imagine replacing brother brandom with Donnie Reagan that's frightening hey I'll have illumination but it's about like a match compared to the Sun a pastor compared to a prophet I got the ability to see what he saw oh brother Donnie don't that bother you not in the least I found my place I'm going a brighten my corner where I am I ain't called to be no major prophet I ain't called to do what that Prophet done I'm called to do what I'm called to do and that's say what he said and do what the Lord Jesus called us to do and what is that protect his [Applause] rights oh my can you imagine a man crossing a stream on a log the only way that man will ever be able to get a Crosset or a woman is to focus on something on the other side if they start looking at that log and their steps and what's around them it's amazing what the mind will do you ever notice things we have committed to our subconscious your heart rate submitted to your subconscious your blood pressure to your subconscious your dream cycles that you go through your subconscious the steps in your home going up and down your garage to your back porch whatever you ever notice how that is you could just well just go right down them unless you start looking at them if You' done that brother Rob I see you smiling at your wife there so then whenever you start looking at it is't it amazing that you will almost stumble if you don't and you say what happened because you you pulled it from the subconscious and you started concerning yourself about it in the first conscience you see if we could do that with our faith oh Lord we struggle so much and we try to make our flesh believe you might as well give up on it it ain't never going to believe right it'll believe sometimes and sometimes it won't the prophet said the Lord Jesus was totally unconscious of his facei and he talked about living in that realm he said now I'm talking about bride people that live a walk with god with oh I'm going to try to live right today I'm going to try to do right don't do that friends committed to your soul let your soul be United together with a man in the engine room and you will do more for God than you ever dreamed possible in your entire life then try to sit around and figure it out oh we've got to bring Revival tell me how to do it oh brother Don the bride needs Revival we've got to have Revival we've all got to this and another show me where a Revival was ever produced by such stuff the prophet of God told us how Revival comes it's when the spirit of God sends Revival we've had all kinds of moves and you know what was behind every one of them an eye that replaced a prophet look at the seventh under move what happened was no longer the absolute authority of a prophet but it was a so-called Apostle who was sent to bring clarity to the message uhhuh then put Clarity up there I don't want Clarity what they call Clarity I want charity look at every move that's been around this message what happened they cut that Prophet out and then sck some preacher in there right and it can be individual churches just one church one preacher and he's got this thing about him that he feels like he knows so much about God we were so ignorant we didn't even know how to come to God right well I don't care if you say Amen or not I'm going to tell you the truth but most of us were so ignorant we didn't know how to be baptized we didn't know if there's an eternal hell we didn't know if there's one in the godhead two in the godhead come on children we didn't hardly know nothing about God right brother Charlie Cox used to say before I met the prophet of God I didn't even know how to cross a fence right and by that what he meant was when they' go hunting and they'd go hunting another people's property they'd go right in the middle of the fence and just push the fence right down and ride it down but they hunting with the prophet a little bit and he told them said boys don't do that again these people's been good to you to let you hunt on their Farms you ought to treat their fence right go up out to that post and step across that fence or pull them two wires apart and go through the don't don't tear up their property we didn't even know then understand a lot of that stuff we didn't think it matter did it but you see an I saw a the ey said now you sisters don't cut that hair and you Brothers you cut yours now you sisters act like women don't put on cover hey I I tell my husband what to do and yes dear Yes dear but what happens I surgery I surgery and they say well you know we just we're just not sure we need no more well we know brother Ram taught that really you know prophecy was always um always something direct to somebody and uh actually that God wouldn't repeat scriptures and prophecy but but that ain't the way we believe it at our church at our church we believe that the spirit of God can move and speaking in tongues say and somebody just yeah said the Lord I'm the Lord I'm here and I'm I'm fixing to do this and I'm coming soon I'm coming soon so what did they do cut the ey's interpretation how cuz the ey said if the preacher stands up there and say Jesus is coming soon he's coming soon he's coming soon he's called to say that but that ain't prophecy that's right y'all a had I surching now have you why is it friends why is it you know what it is men so hungry for a move of God and if we're not careful we'll let this go and that go and that go and oh but we're so blessed Oh My My My we're so blessed sure look in the church age book and you'll find that the prophet tells us people leave the word they just leave the word and they go r on and say hey we get results don't we we get results Bo God blesses us I'll tell you one thing God's doing this that another sure he is and he'll try you by that too to see will you stay with the word even when you overstep it wow there wasn't hardly a preacher in the land that could say it any more than brother balum boy brother B got say glory to God I feeling all over hallelujah oh I seen a I'm man alive I'm telling you what and stepped right over God's original word did God stop blessing why no he prophesied some of the greatest prophecies that's ever been written read numbers 24 he prophesied about the coming of the Lord Jesus and the man was totally out of the will of God right why he's a prophet with a double vision got one eye on God another is on baac he's thinking about SSI Medicare Medicaid part A Part B part C Part D part G part X part Y part Z wow man if I can just do this now why God would God please God please please please please please God said go ahead thank you thank you thank you thank you do you realize what you've just done when God will give you his word and his pattern and then God tells you go ahead I bless you and you say do you understand what you just did you just literally killed yourself and God will bless you and bless you and bless you more which convinces you more and more and more you're right right right even though your foundation was wrong wrong wrong is that what we want for our church friends some of the folks in our message have been that way for years more heading in that direction now oh we're good why we know brother said that's just that's just that's just Baptist and you can't really pay no attention to poor brother Donnie I'll tell you why brother Donnie brother Donnie was in the Pentecostal move and what what it's really done it's it's really scarred brother Donnie and that's made him where he's just he's just really scarred so bad that that he don't want to move a God you're a liar right there ain't a man on the earth that wants to move of God any more than brother Donnie but brother Donnie wants a move of God a move of God which will be based on God's word how can I protect the Lamb of God in this day with the anointing of another other day I've got to have the anointing of this hour to protect the Lamb of [Applause] God oh my can you imagine what it is when the light of God is coming down through the eye passing into the body the whole body is moving with the light of God notice now verse 23 I'll let you rest yourself while we close with this but if thine eye be evil or diseased so it's got something wrong with it that it cannot see thy whole body shall be full of Darkness so look at every manm made move down through time look at Wesley's day what a great day it was but then watch them after Wesley left how they begin to change look at the Methodist church today so when they formed the organization did God's spirit leave them and their churches crashed and they never had nobody else they grew bigger after they formed the organization than they were before they ever had it and they were convinced Bo God is blessing us I'm telling you why I mean we're busting out the seams well I just don't know why we're going to do we're getting so big and oh man a liot this definitely was the right move well let's look back in retrospect was it so now they're so divided they got gay pastors women preachers yeah one of the filthiest churches in the denominational move why they no longer held on to the influence of the eye that's right what if the Lord carries another 10 15 20 years what will be said about our move what will be said about our church Our lives our families well I know what's going to be said about me if I'm alive then I'm still faithful I'm still preaching the same thing of course then it be so old y'all just have pity on me let me preach every now just because you feel sorry for me I guess I ain't going nowhere I ain't moving from behind this eye I feel real safe there that's why I study it I listen to it I preach it I love it maybe some of you are getting tired of the message I don't know maybe you're getting tired of hearing a preach apparently some folks are because they quit coming apparently some folks around the message are getting tired of it because they're going over to these charismatic churches and going over over here and going over there and they out there shopping a little bit looking for something else well I've done I've done found what I was shopping for many many years ago I ain't looking for another eye eyeball eyelid eyelash or makeup to put on this eye I'm perfectly satisfied with the eye that God chose himself I don't figure I need to help God out and put another eye in the Malachi Force Place how many understand what I'm saying and I do not feel like it let me make sure you understand tonight I nor no other Pastor is qualified to add to what God's Prophet said as a matter of fact we'll get to it the prophet said three times in the Bible it was an unpardonable sin to add one word of your own interpretation to a message after been Vindicated to be the truth I don't think preachers realize what they're doing they're watering changing misplacing dislocating do you understand what you're doing do people understand what they're doing three times in the Bible an unpardonable sin not to leave out a book not to leave out a year but to add one word of your own interpretation to a message after been Vindicated to be the truth God help us God help us children if we will stay under the influence of our eye all the light we need even for the Rapture has been emitted down into this word if this goes on 200 years message preachers will still be preaching things out of this message that we probably ain't never even preached before and it's been laying here the whole time right in the message everything we have need of is right here that's right we don't need to go outside of our ranks and get another eye and change this and what about this guy what about that guy look at those who's went that way is that what you want for your end that ain't what I want for M I want to stay right in the Rays of that light and they told told him he will come to you first and you will be judged for what you preached and if you are accepted and you will be then we will go in on your teaching so the illumination that came through him and his Kentucky ways and his grammar and his nouns and his pronouns but what'll be surprising is one day our bodies will be changed I guess it wasn't the noun in the pronoun that God was concerned about then was it I mean that's a big thing in this day you know men don't want to be called by him anymore and then women don't want to be called by she anymore well you're supposed to call them shim Jim sham Jam I'm not sure exactly what re supposed to say anymore but I'm so glad that we can be able to hear what God is saying don't you understand what they're doing it's all about their rights they rights they rights that's right and that's the way we are for now careful me mine mine that's not why you're here for you're here to protect his right amen it's bar it oh Jesus Lord God I pray you would help us father what is scary thing it is to be a preacher it's a fearful thing to be a godall one and there's thousands of them that aren't even called it's evident we can see by some of the messes that even message preachers have made a lot of them ain't called either the prophet tells us in question answer 61 that he what he liked to look at was the person and see what they claim they were called to do because God will work with his creature the way that he's made him so he said if a man claims to be a pastor he can't be a flighty person God would never call a man like that to be a pastor and he said if a man claims to be a teacher watch how he interprets the word that'll tell you whether he's really called of God or not it's evident Lord just by that simple quote a lot of so-called teachers were not godall but the way they interpreted the word it's pretty visible when they get done they bring more confusion they have more questions and they do answers oh Lord help us may we stay in the Rays of the light father glory to God Jesus please help me me help me that I'll never leave this word father if I would ever start to the left or the right if you have to take me out of this world if I get stubborn and hard-headed and I won't be corrected take me out of this life Lord don't let me bring reproach God knowing that one day preachers are going to give an account and if there ain't but one Soul they lead astray that one soul will condemn them the prophet talked about when he was here that how many preachers said in their study and read acts 238 before they come out to preach but they wouldn't dare read it how many of these coward message preachers have the message books and the tapes and they sit and study them and Rob and use a prophet's words won't even tell where it come from yeah they'll answer at the day of judgment for it Lord God help me help these people father may we get away from our ideas and our opinions and my rights and they hurt my feelings and I think and I want this and I want that help us to realize Lord we are here to protect your rights and I've learned this if I will protect yours you will stand stand in defense of mine I've seen you do it many times Lord as you spoke to me some months ago about a certain thing that was going on you told me hold your peace I'll fight for you who better to do our fighting than you Lord Jesus but the problem of it is we take so many of our battles on our own and we try to handle it our way forgive us Lord oh Jesus may your presence sweep down in this building tonight father May every person under the sound of my voice leave here tonight with a different view to realize their main purpose in life is not to make money their main purpose in life is not to be the smarter person and the wiser person get this degree and that degree and another degree their main purpose in life is to defend your rights it's no wonder you hate compromise cuz compromise always leads to you losing your rights you have a right to have sons and daughters of God that are filled with the Holy Ghost praise God it's your right to have a church that's a Holiness Church it's your right to have a church that believes in the Supernatural then Lord God we're here to protect your rights as long as I'm in my right mind and I've got strength father I'm going to stand in this Pulpit I'm not going to defend myself so much I'm not going to defend these people so much and I will do that to a degree but my main main calling is not to defend us my main calling is to defend you and your rights for this purpose was I called for this purpose will I answer to for this purpose I will die for if necessary Hallelujah I'm reminded of polycarp that day when they come to him and said you're an old man a man of honor and integrity why don't you deny him why don't you deny him you're you're a man that's well thought of he said all these years I've served him and he's nothing done me nothing but good I won't repent and I won't recant tell me why I should praise God praise God thank you for men like that that was their anointing but now Lord we're on the earth under another anointing I believe you've got men women boys girls that ain't even preachers that'll give their life for your cause they are part of that cause it's your right to live in their soul and they are willing to fight against their nature their makeup their own inheritance as a human being to give you that right may we realize part of this fight is not just us against other people it's us against ourself that you have a right to live in me to speak out of my mouth Lord God I will fight Donnie Reagan till my last breath is taken out of this body to see that you have have that right amen praise God how many with me in this building tonight will raise your hand you'll not just fight for him to have his rights in the church but you'll fight for him to have his rights in you it's his right for you to be filled with the Holy Ghost to have his nature praise God it's his right for deity to be in you for you to be endued with power from on high that the mind of Christ can be projected in you and you can believe what your natural body cannot even grasp that's his right but you'll have to fight yourself to Grant him his rights praise God we worship you tonight Lord Jesus Hallelujah Lord thank you Father thank you Lord God we praise you tonight Lord Jesus it's your right to live in me Father live in me it's your right to speak out of my mouth speak to me Lord It's Your Right to love through me live through me speak to me I know I'll have to fight myself cuz I'm my greatest enemy Lord God I'm willing I'm willing to fight me oh it's easy for us to fight our brother fight this man fight that woman but can we fight ourself and subdue ourself to the very law of God yes Lord we will yes Lord we will Paul told us himself that he had to Die daily why he was fighting for your rights praise God thank you Lord Lord Jesus may we as a body defend your truths I ain't talk about going out and arguing with people and great you know trying to raise a big argument and a fuss and the debate but to let our lights so shine before men oh if they can only see tonight father once they receive the true light through the messenger that you put in every age then we actually become part of that light we become the light the carriers of the message and then people can look at see the very thing that many times the women are ashamed of their hair their dress their looks will be the very thing that'll catch people's attention and say why do you dress that way why are you different What Makes You Different what if they look like everybody else and talk like everybody else there wouldn't be no difference but it's that difference that you designated and the light of the Gospel let's that spread out through them and get other people's attention thank you for it father oh we worship you Lord we worship you Lord thank you Lord can we just raise our hands praise the Lord praise the Lord what about it musicians Brothers you too let's just raise our hands in the presence of the king he wants to use you Brothers like never before I believe he wants to use you singers that are committed to God like never before you preacher Brothers I believe God wants to use us men of God around the world like never before but we've got to keep in line with the eye and Satan will do everything in his power to pull you away from the influ influence of that because those light rays emitted through that eye will change you and change you and change you until eventually it will change your body amen oh Hallelujah Lord oh shine on us tonight Lord God Shine On Us father I pray we don't want the light of Hollywood we don't like want the lights of glimmer and show we don't want Hollywood Showmanship in our Pulpit Lord God we don't want our choirs father to be all practice and no anointing I thank you Lord when they get up to sing the spirit of God is welcome among them I thank you
