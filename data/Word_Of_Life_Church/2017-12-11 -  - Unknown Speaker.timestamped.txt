[32:26] delay of response to her Lord
[32:29] His mercy once again has been extended
[32:32] to her and he's fixing to find her while

[32:53] love and verse 9 they respond back to

[33:42] rivers of waters washed with milk and
[33:47] fitly said she does not see him as the
[33:51] wigged one who has come to bring
[33:53] judgment but she sees him as in his
[33:57] glorified body as it were when all the
[33:59] gray is gone his eyes are not a flame of
[34:02] fire coming to bring vengeance and
[34:04] judgment upon the earth but she sees the
[34:07] eyes of doves what does she see she sees
[34:11] not only her Lord but her lover I mean
[34:15] about to be remembered today in prayer
[34:17] before the Lord God bless you myself as
[34:19] well let's pray together
[34:20] Heavenly Father thank you so much that
[34:23] we could be able to have church today
[34:24] Lord
[34:26] how we're longing for that great day
[34:29] when all we'll be doing is having church
[34:31] would just be changed being your
[34:33] presence be there through the ceaseless
[34:36] ages never to leave again father Lord
[34:40] until that time arrives we keep pressing
[34:43] the battle the Lord we have many needs
[34:45] among us we have many folks that are in
[34:48] desperate situation Lord we're just
[34:51] asking Lord the Jesus it should be
[34:53] mindful of each one hundreds of hands
[34:55] worth lifted today no doubt the
[34:57] invisible audience there were as well we
[35:00] know that you Lord Jesus came to the
[35:02] earth that you might fully redeem us not
[35:05] just to save our soul but to bring peace
[35:08] and harmony there every aspect of our
[35:11] being the prey that should speak to us
[35:13] today from your word help me that I can
[35:15] get out of the way Lord anoint me joint
[35:18] two people maybe be able to leave here
[35:20] today and say did not our hearts burn
[35:22] within us as he talked with us along the
[35:25] way speak to us father we ask in Jesus
[35:28] name and the Saints said
[35:30] god bless you may be sitting
[35:36] there their terminology to
[35:41] him is something that all of us deal
[35:45] with every day of our life that is
[35:48] valium so they asked her what is your
[35:52] beloved more than so more than is a
[35:56] connection of two words which renders a
[35:59] value about which we decide if something
[36:03] is worth a price whenever you go to buy
[36:07] something to eat you'll do it here in a
[36:09] couple of hours you will set down with
[36:11] the restaurant you'll take the menu out
[36:13] and you'll look at it and you're called
[36:15] between maybe between chicken or pork or
[36:18] fish or beef and then you look at the
[36:21] beef and so I think I'll go with beef
[36:23] today well you look at a sirloin steak
[36:26] it's a certain amount you look at one
[36:28] that's a little better it's gonna be a
[36:29] little more depends on how much you want
[36:31] to spend and you will set there and you
[36:34] will evaluate that and think oh that's
[36:37] too much there's no allowable to pay
[36:39] that now there's no way you're going to
[36:40] convince me that a prime rib was the
[36:43] same price as a cheeseburger that most
[36:45] of us wouldn't eat it more often than
[36:46] what we do if you're going to convince
[36:49] me that a lobster tail is the same price
[36:52] as bubblegum I'm gonna call you a liar
[36:54] right out front because if we know
[36:56] that's not true the kind of car we drive
[36:58] the type of clothes that we wear type of
[37:01] shoes that we have most of our life is
[37:03] based upon these values of mores and so
[37:07] we look at how much they would want for
[37:09] a you know a steak dinner and it's say
[37:11] 1199 and then you could go on up and get
[37:14] one that's even better and even better a
[37:16] port a porterhouse or Delmonico or
[37:19] something like that and you say my
[37:21] goodness there ain't no way in the world
[37:22] I'm paying those 75 dollars for an old
[37:25] piece of meat I didn't want the whole
[37:26] hind leg I just wanted a little 8 ounce
[37:28] piece I ain't no way so what did you do
[37:31] you determined that it was not worth
[37:34] more than the amount that would you
[37:37] would have to shell out of your wallet
[37:39] or what you would have to put on a
[37:41] credit card so you decided that that sir
[37:44] was exactly what you wanted now you can
[37:47] act like it's what you wanted first
[37:48] choice if you want to but more Xan
[37:51] determines much of what we do in life
[37:54] now there's people here today I've
[37:56] driven some of you driven an hour and a
[37:58] half some of you a couple hours some
[38:00] three three and a half four hours you
[38:02] know there's there's many churches they
[38:04] passed on the way to church here today
[38:06] they could have stopped it many of those
[38:09] different churches but they determined
[38:11] and felt like that it was worse to
[38:13] driving farther because they would get
[38:16] more than they got by the church that
[38:19] was right down the road even though it
[38:21] was a church it had a preacher they had
[38:24] songs and might had a piano no Oregon
[38:26] but they felt like they would get more
[38:28] than that what they would get up there
[38:31] by driving a little farther you
[38:34] understand what I'm saying now whenever
[38:36] they ask this Shulamite the question of
[38:39] what is your it beloved more than
[38:41] another
[38:43] beloved they're placing to her the
[38:46] question of value the value of what is
[38:49] he more than other beloved's now they're
[38:52] not saying that he's the only one nor is
[38:54] she saying that he is the only one but
[38:57] she has this personal value was in
[39:00] herself that he is more valuable than
[39:02] anything else now you tell me how you
[39:06] love God and I'll look at the way you
[39:08] serve God and I'll tell you right quick
[39:10] ly on your consistency of that how you
[39:13] value truce how you value the Lord Jesus
[39:16] how you value the superior things of
[39:19] your life by what you give to them what
[39:22] you say really doesn't have much
[39:24] relevance its to what you really really
[39:27] do and how you react and how you respond
[39:30] now if you respond to the Lord and his
[39:32] word and you give him pretty much
[39:35] everything preeminence in your life not
[39:37] that that's the only thing that you do
[39:39] but he has the preeminence of that then
[39:41] to me I'm able to assume that that is
[39:43] the value that you determine his value
[39:47] is worth more than the things of the
[39:50] world you understand now whenever they
[39:52] are asked heard this very intimate
[39:54] question because they are overwhelmed by
[39:57] the way she has presented it to them now
[40:00] they've looked at her and they see that
[40:02] she's quite a notable woman she is quite
[40:05] unknowable person so now something is
[40:08] actually so happened to her being in His
[40:11] divine presence that it has changed her
[40:13] and increased her own value now by doing
[40:16] that she can do one of two things with
[40:19] that she can take that and allow that to
[40:22] be an element of pride which many people
[40:24] do they will allow the redemptive price
[40:26] for which it's been paid for them and
[40:28] they will turn it around in their mind
[40:30] and somehow assume that they are better
[40:33] than somebody else because the Lord
[40:35] Jesus paid this price for them and when
[40:37] you do you're on your way out you know
[40:39] he has increased our value but it was
[40:42] him that done it and not us because
[40:45] we're still worthless anyway as far as
[40:46] our humanity and there's nothing good
[40:48] about any of us false said there was
[40:50] nothing not any good at all than any of
[40:53] us and I'll say it for you the same way
[40:54] so we have no value other than the value
[40:58] what makes you and I so valuable is the
[41:01] value that he rendered by which he paid
[41:04] for us so if I had in my hands today say
[41:07] five drops of the literal blood of the
[41:09] Lord Jesus if his actual chemistry of
[41:11] the blood of the Lord Jesus we could
[41:13] prove it by DNA scientifically proven
[41:15] that it was a real chemistry the whole
[41:17] make up the creative blood of God never
[41:19] a blood that was ever like it never
[41:21] shall be again but it was a creative
[41:23] blood of God to flow through the
[41:25] humanity of the Lord Jesus and I could
[41:27] prove to you that it was the literal
[41:29] blood and yet I would say and I would
[41:31] say look at church would have gotten my
[41:32] hand today and y'all would set our oh my
[41:35] oh my brother don t be careful don't let
[41:37] it run down don't let it drop on the
[41:38] floor that in your body would step on it
[41:40] why because you would value that blood
[41:43] so much and probably we would tend to
[41:46] make an idol out of that blood because
[41:48] they sent wow that was so wonderful and
[41:50] it was and it was so great yet he valued
[41:54] you more than the chemistry of his own
[41:58] blood because he gave that for you now
[42:02] again keeping the value your clothes the
[42:05] value of what you're going to eat today
[42:06] the value of your house a value of your
[42:08] property the value of things that you do
[42:10] so we no matter what we say by our
[42:12] mouths our actions render the value of
[42:15] the qualities that are in our lives and
[42:18] people say oh I love God with all my
[42:19] heart I'll tell you what I love Church I
[42:21] love olive olive olive but just watch
[42:23] how they live and what they do and that
[42:26] will really tell you the price tag they
[42:28] have on it now no matter what they say
[42:31] you know words are cheap anybody say
[42:32] anything they want to but it's really
[42:34] the way that we live it's the same way
[42:36] with God now God could say I love you
[42:39] all so much and I feel so sorry for you
[42:41] and he could say that in heaven and do
[42:42] absolutely nothing about it we would
[42:45] question his his superiority of his
[42:48] judgment by saying he loved us so much
[42:50] and felt so sorry for us so what did he
[42:53] do he conned in sin to be kind of into a
[42:56] currency by which could be prayed or
[42:59] transferred to the value of us now there
[43:02] was no currency between divinity and
[43:04] humanity that would be able to pay our
[43:07] debt so God had to overhaul it God had
[43:10] to make our currency which would be
[43:13] accepted by God by man and where the
[43:16] devil would shut his mouth so there had
[43:19] to be a currency created by which
[43:22] justice would be met condemnation voice
[43:25] would be silenced and the innocent would
[43:28] be innocent for ever and ever and ever
[43:31] there was no currency that exists money
[43:34] gold silver trading whatever more barter
[43:37] no matter what you do there was no
[43:39] currency that exists to settle such a
[43:42] death so the great Elohim the Mighty One
[43:44] himself the Almighty he created a
[43:47] currency which would meet all three of
[43:50] these aspects and be able to resolve
[43:52] absolutely resolve our debt and free us
[43:56] from it and places so before him that
[43:58] even accuser would be dumbfounded he
[44:02] would make up Laos he would make up
[44:04] accusations but I'm going to come right
[44:06] down to your record is this clear it is
[44:09] whiter than the snow on our ground
[44:11] [Applause]
[44:14] because God developed a currency by
[44:18] which you could be bought as what the
[44:20] Redeemer is of course by which you would
[44:22] be bought back into the presence of God
[44:24] and the peace would be absolutely
[44:26] substantiated by the price that would be
[44:29] paid in so much that he would value you
[44:32] of a higher value than his own blood now
[44:36] humanly we might struggle with self and
[44:38] we would look at that and think my
[44:40] goodness you've got to be kinder the
[44:42] donee that we are worth more than his
[44:44] voice that's not me saying that that's
[44:46] him proving it about what he did
[44:49] understand his actions prove that he
[44:53] valued you more than he did his own
[44:55] blood more than he did his own life more
[44:58] than he did his own peace in his
[45:00] humanity because he gave that up for you
[45:03] so you were worth more than his blood so
[45:08] I ask you then if you really love him
[45:10] what should he be worth more than what
[45:14] if you really love him it's one simple
[45:16] word every same
[45:18] everything your pride your arrogance if
[45:21] need be you'll love him more than mama
[45:23] and daddy's and brothers and sister
[45:26] whatever more because that value that
[45:28] was paid for you once you or burst into
[45:31] the decibel of value once you are burst
[45:35] into that it brings an equation that God
[45:38] that we have should have had in the
[45:39] beginning but by pride were raised up to
[45:42] a spot people who think they're so high
[45:44] and so majestic and so wonderful they've
[45:46] never really been born again real no
[45:48] matter what they say because if you're
[45:50] born into the value of the costs of the
[45:53] blood it renders to you it takes away
[45:56] that element of the human pride and
[45:58] arrogance that we're all born with come
[46:01] on now priests women but yet and it
[46:03] brings you to a burst of humility
[46:05] humility is not just something that we
[46:08] put on and act like we're nobody and act
[46:11] like we're those you're not most have
[46:12] seen people like that and they said
[46:14] they're nobody there no count but we
[46:16] know they don't really mean that because
[46:17] they're not burst in humility by the
[46:20] value of the redemption but once you're
[46:23] burst into why would somebody preach the
[46:25] niccola's listen this is fresh right
[46:27] here Fred this ain't written down oh no
[46:29] no time and somebody hasn't either this
[46:31] morning but when we are burst into that
[46:34] it's not something that we have to try
[46:35] to put on it is the nature of our Birds
[46:38] and the Spirit of God brings in a
[46:40] natural humility about what's humanly we
[46:44] know we don't deserve in the first place
[46:45] but the way he looks at it we are worth
[46:48] more than his blood we are worth more
[46:52] than the price that he paid Oh does he
[46:54] have any regrets none whatsoever he'd do
[46:57] it all over again hey man I believe he'd
[47:01] do it for one myself
[47:03] that's exactly right now in that what
[47:06] does it do to her now that they see that
[47:08] there is a value in her then they are
[47:10] puzzled they're bewildered somewhat to
[47:13] say why would he mean so much to you
[47:15] what is the increase of his value and
[47:19] that you yourself are quite worthy now
[47:21] you're quite notable you've really been
[47:23] changed you're a different person that's
[47:25] inevitable that we can see that that you
[47:27] have been changed something has really
[47:29] really transformed you and you are so
[47:32] notable yourself why is he's so great
[47:34] but it is the rendered value by which he
[47:37] has paid for her that has increased her
[47:39] own value by divine revelation and she's
[47:42] not looking at it in herself and saying
[47:44] well I'm this I'm that the other I'm
[47:45] where I'm worth this and that not it is
[47:47] the value prayed that disbursed her in
[47:50] to the estimated value by which he gets
[47:53] her that she considered herself worth it
[47:55] today I was so lonely not she still
[47:58] looks and said I'm not worthy I'm not
[48:00] good enough and it never will be y1
[48:02] that's borne of that you know what we'll
[48:04] have that until our body searches one of
[48:07] these days we're gonna walk up in the
[48:09] presence of God and the dollar signs and
[48:12] the values and the transcending of all
[48:14] that it'll totally be lifted and we
[48:17] would be birthed into a body that the
[48:20] element of unworthiness is no longer
[48:23] tired you bowing your head and feeling
[48:26] the shame and humble you think you're
[48:28] going to live for eternity in that kind
[48:30] of a party or that kind of a state I
[48:32] tell you here today you are not as long
[48:35] as this mortality is still bearing
[48:37] resemblance of that much Adam lost no
[48:40] doubt we will deal with it but when we
[48:41] get a body which matches our soul
[48:44] brother sister we will be elevated to
[48:47] that spot our soul desires this very day
[48:51] right now whenever they ask her what is
[48:55] your beloved more zan again the value
[48:57] she look they're looking at what she's
[48:59] give up for him what she's done for him
[49:02] and they can see that she has a greater
[49:04] than perspective than what they do now
[49:07] many people look at different things of
[49:10] life and people walk up on a Mercedes
[49:12] law and they say you know what I want
[49:14] that car well maybe man you'd be able to
[49:16] walk up on the Lama said what's a nice
[49:18] car but I think I'll go to the
[49:20] Volkswagen park I think I'll buy one
[49:22] over there why because out the value of
[49:25] the way will you look at it well a lot
[49:27] of folks look at church and the Lord
[49:28] Jesus the same way now they may want the
[49:31] kind of life in one way that you have
[49:33] they may want to walk with God so
[49:35] whenever you pray that God hears your
[49:38] prayer and answers your prayer but to
[49:40] give up what what they feel like they
[49:42] would have to give up they wouldn't
[49:44] consider it be worth more than you know
[49:47] they have to quit wearing this and
[49:49] looking like that in doing this and they
[49:51] can't say this no more and listen to
[49:52] this kind of music no more so they don't
[49:55] consider the trade all of the same so
[49:57] that other than oh no I don't want to be
[49:59] that way I can't live like that I
[50:01] respect him and you know they're okay
[50:02] and all that I don't have anything bad
[50:04] to say against them but to me it's not
[50:06] worse than Oh exactly now we've got to
[50:08] the price so we've got the price on side
[50:11] and then we put the value of all these
[50:13] things on the other side of the scale
[50:15] and then what do people do they consider
[50:17] the value and the cost of honest if this
[50:19] not worth it why would I want to come to
[50:21] church like here whenever you get burnt
[50:23] all the time and you get preach song and
[50:24] all that sort of thing when there's all
[50:26] kinds of churches will you go to and
[50:28] they smother you with butter and
[50:29] molasses and honey tell you how good
[50:32] y'all have sweets aha kinds y'all all of
[50:34] us is going to heaven in the first place
[50:36] it don't make no difference whether we
[50:37] live right or not well I know what I
[50:38] want to go to a church with a preacher
[50:40] preaches you visiting preachers Bernie
[50:42] up evangelist burn yet seem like every
[50:45] preacher that comes to this truth such
[50:46] on fire roshan then heats you alive and
[50:49] then sends you home and you come back
[50:50] for more than that service
[50:53] well you see some of you you come back
[50:56] repeatedly because you consider it worse
[50:59] more than more as an excess flesh
[51:04] you get in your will you consider the
[51:08] value of the word worse more than you
[51:11] going to a church so they're just gonna
[51:12] rub you on the head and Pat's you tell
[51:14] you how good you are now sweet chiming
[51:16] you know yeah in the first place but
[51:18] yeah you consider this I'm more value
[51:20] than you would by going to a church
[51:22] where they just rub you on the head so
[51:24] what do you do then you put that in one
[51:26] side of the cell you put the valve what
[51:28] you're getting on the other side and you
[51:30] say it totally outweighs it I am more
[51:32] than willing to go to a house of God
[51:35] where a pastor will preach to me the
[51:37] truth
[51:39] right
[51:41] other people look at the same thing and
[51:44] they say nope not me I couldn't handle a
[51:46] man like that I could not stand it so
[51:48] I'm going to another place of what they
[51:50] do that put the value of it one side and
[51:52] they put the word and the other psalmist
[51:53] said I can go to that church this is
[51:54] easy I've been there for six months he
[51:56] never preached something you better run
[51:58] like crazy if you've been to church
[52:00] three times in the last week you ain't
[52:02] got burnt I'll leave that church quick
[52:06] unless you showed up and they wouldn't
[52:08] have a meeting or something like that
[52:09] now that's that's understandable but if
[52:11] you go to the house of God you ain't
[52:12] preached on and you're living and
[52:14] Laodicea sorry rotten eggs I'm later to
[52:17] see his
[52:20] but there again it comes to value in the
[52:22] way that people look at now the
[52:24] Shulamite is being asked this great
[52:27] important question today she feels that
[52:30] the value of this question is so great
[52:34] that she's not sure that she should take
[52:38] it upon herself to be able to try to
[52:41] answer such a profound question it is a
[52:46] question which not only involves time
[52:49] but it goes beyond time as a matter of
[52:53] fact it goes further back than dinosaurs
[52:57] it goes further back than the geological
[53:01] ages of the Earth's past so she doesn't
[53:05] feel quite adequate to be able to answer
[53:09] this question simply based upon her
[53:12] Mirror emotional feelings that she would
[53:15] have for him though they are great but
[53:17] she would like your blessing and she
[53:21] would like your approval this morning to
[53:23] be able to answer this question from the
[53:28] word
[53:30] does she have your approval that she's
[53:33] going to answer with or without it but
[53:34] it's just nicer if y'all say yes
[53:38] what does your beloved mean more than
[53:43] another
[53:44] so if your Jesus greater more powerful
[53:48] than Allah is he what more can he do for
[53:52] you then a Muslim receives from his
[53:56] religion now we bring a know down in the
[53:59] Christianity so what does the message of
[54:03] the hour what would dis church this
[54:06] preacher this assembly give you more
[54:09] than a Baptist Church or a charismatic
[54:12] church or an apostolic church or a
[54:15] Church of God is there any difference
[54:17] really is there any difference is there
[54:20] any value that you would get more out of
[54:23] going to take the same amount of time to
[54:25] get up call me a hairbrush to take a
[54:27] shower you know all them sorts of things
[54:29] paint splatters lotions and whatever
[54:30] other people would do to be able to get
[54:32] ready take the same matter of time to
[54:34] tie your time same amount of time to put
[54:36] on your socks photos shoes they will
[54:38] come to the house of God so would you
[54:39] get any more out of coming to one place
[54:43] over another place and some of you drove
[54:45] for quite a ways is it going to be worse
[54:47] your value the amount of gas that it
[54:50] took the amount of effort that you had
[54:52] to put forth
[54:55] well that will depend upon the price and
[54:58] it'll depend upon what you get back in
[55:01] the place for the price paid right and
[55:04] then you're the one who will determine
[55:06] the value now we know how they are about
[55:10] value that we'll look at one thing
[55:12] people I wouldn't have that thing so now
[55:13] sir I bid fifty six thousand nine
[55:16] hundred and ninety five dollars and
[55:18] you're cranking on say I want to see a
[55:20] first-class idiot
[55:23] they said that man bought that antique
[55:25] piece and he paid fifty six thousand oh
[55:28] but you didn't follow him down the road
[55:30] he sold it for a quarter of a million
[55:34] so who understood valued you or him you
[55:40] see I'm not just looking at what this
[55:42] message is going to produce in me now
[55:46] I'm waiting to see when the rapture
[55:49] happens who will go and who won't
[55:54] it's really going to pay off there
[55:56] [Applause]
[55:58] now she would like to begin in the
[56:03] beginning and of course she's assuming
[56:06] light she's a woman so she came through
[56:07] so I'm gonna do it for
[56:10] Saint John 1 and 1 in the beginning was
[56:13] the word and the Word was with God and
[56:17] the Word was God the same was in the
[56:22] beginning with God all things
[56:27] were made by him and without him was not
[56:32] anything made that was made now won't
[56:35] you notice how you've asked her about
[56:38] him not about them
[56:44] and her response is not poor ality she
[56:49] is not a
[56:51] trinitarian
[56:54] neither she to Lord
[56:57] she has one
[57:00] so in the beginning was the word
[57:04] now this is not Rhema but it is logos in
[57:07] the beginning was the logos and then of
[57:10] course she'd like to reiterate you verse
[57:11] 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[57:14] among us and we beheld his course on the
[57:16] only begotten of the father of course
[57:17] full of grace and truth that John goes
[57:18] on to say now what's in this Colossians
[57:21] chapter 1 verse 14 in whom we have
[57:24] redemption through his but not there his
[57:27] blood even the forgiveness of sin who is
[57:31] the image of the invisible God the
[57:35] firstborn of every creature for by him
[57:39] were all things created
[57:44] now if you want to know what value that
[57:47] he has what is he more's and Shintoism
[57:52] what is he more than Islam what is he
[57:56] more zan well this is where we're gonna
[57:58] get started all things were created
[58:01] by him
[58:03] [Applause]

[1:00:09] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[1:00:12] dominions or principalities

[1:00:49] all things in heaven all seams in the
[1:00:53] earth all things all principality all
[1:00:56] powers are created
[1:00:58] for him
[1:01:00] [Applause]
[1:01:04] listen to this I found this Adam Clarke
[1:01:07] was a theologian that lived many many
[1:01:10] hundreds of years ago mr. Modi said
[1:01:13] creation is the proper work of an
[1:01:16] infinite unlimited and unoriginal being
[1:01:21] possessed of all perfections in their
[1:01:24] highest degrees capable of knowing
[1:01:27] willing and working indefinitely
[1:01:30] unlimitedly and without control and as
[1:01:34] creation signifies the production of
[1:01:37] being were always absolute non-entity so
[1:01:41] it is necessarily implies that the
[1:01:44] create or acted off and from himself
[1:01:51] you see one of the difference between my
[1:01:54] Jesus and a lot of Christians Jesus is
[1:01:56] their Jesus is second-in-command
[1:01:58] he can't really make much of anything
[1:02:00] without his daddy's permission Papa can
[1:02:03] I do this Papa can I do that one that my
[1:02:06] Jesus is totally different than that my
[1:02:08] Jesus created All Saints
[1:02:10] [Applause]
[1:02:12] that's right he's more oh man he's more
[1:02:16] than enough for whatever I face in my
[1:02:19] life
[1:02:20] creation therefore is the work of him
[1:02:23] who is on
[1:02:25] originated infinite unlimited and
[1:02:30] eternal
[1:02:31] Jesus Christ is the creator of all
[1:02:35] things
[1:02:37] [Applause]
[1:02:39] therefore Jesus Christ must be according
[1:02:42] to the plain construction of the
[1:02:44] Apostles words truly and properly God
[1:02:52] as every effect depends upon its cause
[1:02:56] and cannot exist without it so creation
[1:03:01] which is an effect of the power and
[1:03:04] skill of the creator can only exist and
[1:03:08] be preserved by a continuance of that
[1:03:12] energy that first gave it being he
[1:03:16] didn't just make it and leave it like
[1:03:18] that all the stars are still upheld by
[1:03:21] his power the Sun the moon day night
[1:03:25] it's all kept by his power
[1:03:28] [Applause]
[1:03:33] now this man didn't live in
[1:03:35] Jeffersonville
[1:03:37] he was a Methodist
[1:03:41] born 1762 died 1832
[1:03:49] this is the man age the man age when God
[1:03:53] was anointing the mind don't think
[1:03:55] you're the only ones that knows about
[1:03:57] God
[1:04:01] Colossians 1:17 and he is before all
[1:04:05] things and by him all things
[1:04:10] consist not just made by the field they
[1:04:14] still consider every sinner that got up
[1:04:16] today and started breathing the breath
[1:04:18] of her they owe that breath for the
[1:04:20] Almighty God
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:24] glory to God he upholds all things by
[1:04:28] the power of his word or as the
[1:04:30] scripture says the word of his power the
[1:04:32] stars in their constellation Orion
[1:04:35] Pleiades Arcturus they all have
[1:04:37] maintained their position by whom him
[1:04:39] who created it in the beginning he who
[1:04:42] set the pillars of the earth all glory
[1:04:44] to God Hebrews 1:1 God and sundry times
[1:04:48] and in divers manners spoken time pass
[1:04:50] under the father's by the prophets hath
[1:04:52] in these last days spoken unto us by his
[1:04:54] son but who notices whom he has
[1:04:58] appointed heir of all things by whom
[1:05:00] also he made the world's
[1:05:06] been the brightness of his glory and the
[1:05:09] Express image of his person and
[1:05:11] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:05:15] power not the power of his word the word
[1:05:18] of his power
[1:05:20] when he had himself purged our sins sat
[1:05:23] down on the right hand of the Majesty on
[1:05:26] her all glory to God now the chapter 2
[1:05:29] verse 9 but we see Jesus who was made a
[1:05:32] little lower than the Angels for the
[1:05:33] suffering of death crowned with glory
[1:05:35] and honor that he by the grace of God
[1:05:38] should taste death for every man it
[1:05:41] became him for whom are all alpha
[1:05:45] Sophists are all things and by whom are
[1:05:48] all things in bringing many sons
[1:05:55] not sinners making them sons but
[1:05:58] bringing sons into glory
[1:06:01] banjo Tamara he shall save his people
[1:06:04] from their sins that was already his
[1:06:06] people before he came
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:12] that's my Jesus my Jesus is not what I
[1:06:15] hope somebody will be sir I hope
[1:06:17] somebody find out that in my beloved my
[1:06:19] beloved movie before the foundation the
[1:06:22] world
[1:06:23] [Applause]
[1:06:27] war it's a god not assistant obey the
[1:06:31] voice of the angel are not seen fit to
[1:06:32] we know the angel that read Moses was
[1:06:35] the angel of the Covenant which is
[1:06:37] Christ the Son of God or
[1:06:42] the logos that came out of God
[1:06:47] was the son of God
[1:06:50] now if you can find war two or three guy
[1:06:54] in the Godhead in the Old Testament
[1:06:57] then continuity should run truth that
[1:07:00] there be at least two or three in the
[1:07:01] new
[1:07:02] but if there's only one in the old
[1:07:07] since God didn't have a wife to have a
[1:07:10] baby by
[1:07:14] God produced the Sun out of his own
[1:07:16] being but it wasn't another person it
[1:07:19] was an extension of the original person
[1:07:22] himself now unlike our words the word of
[1:07:27] God is so different from ours because
[1:07:28] God's Word has substance it has traits
[1:07:32] it has characteristics it has power ours
[1:07:35] are fleeting changing so on and so on
[1:07:37] but not God's word in the beginning was
[1:07:40] the word but what was before the
[1:07:42] beginning it was of course the eternal
[1:07:45] so in the beginning was when God calmed
[1:07:47] in sin from eternity to give birth to a
[1:07:50] son but this son was not a human looking
[1:07:54] object by which God had come out of
[1:07:56] God's fear but it was the word or the
[1:08:00] logos it was not a man it was not an old
[1:08:03] man sitting up there and then out of the
[1:08:05] old man coming young man no it was a
[1:08:07] great eternal great white light and out
[1:08:11] of that great white like um a little
[1:08:13] white light which was the hope God it
[1:08:17] was God giving birth to a son
[1:08:20] that's a model as it is
[1:08:24] [Applause]
[1:08:27] the logos that came out of God was the
[1:08:31] son of God question answers on Genesis
[1:08:34] now notice until Wow I begin to see a
[1:08:38] little sacred light
[1:08:40] begin to form a little halo or something
[1:08:45] you can only see it by spiritual eyes to
[1:08:49] look now while we're looking the whole
[1:08:52] church
[1:08:53] or standing on a great banister and
[1:08:57] watching what God's doing
[1:09:00] and we get right down to the questions
[1:09:03] here and see how he brings it on no one
[1:09:05] has seen God and now the next thing we
[1:09:08] begin to see by eyes of supernatural
[1:09:10] looking we see a little white light
[1:09:12] forming out there what is that that was
[1:09:17] called the Bible readers logos or the
[1:09:19] anointed or the anointing as I was going
[1:09:23] to say the part of God that began to
[1:09:25] develop
[1:09:26] into something so human beings could
[1:09:29] have a some type of an idea of what it
[1:09:32] was so it begin to develop out of the
[1:09:34] unseen tangible world into a tangible
[1:09:37] world where it would be physically seen
[1:09:40] he'll test
[1:09:43] varamyr when he comes from the invisible
[1:09:47] from that words cannot be seen to the
[1:09:50] visible to the tangible the tangible
[1:09:53] part is sonship
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:10:02] invisibility is the father
[1:10:05] visibility is the sonship
[1:10:11] God not to Lourdes the same God coming
[1:10:15] from the invisible rim 12 decibel Remini
[1:10:18] gives birth to himself
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:27] anybody see which wind of the devil went
[1:10:29] out of
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:36] the part of God that began to develop
[1:10:38] into something so human beings could
[1:10:40] have
[1:10:42] type of an idea of what it was oh please
[1:10:46] don't move your head poll tells of
[1:10:49] Zechariah chapter 5 verse 1 for we know
[1:10:51] if there's hearth they have said this
[1:10:52] time an uncle be dissolved we have a
[1:10:53] building of God not made me down sows
[1:10:55] you turn on the heavens
[1:10:59] eternal in the heavens
[1:11:01] if your theophany had a day it started
[1:11:03] it'll have a day inland
[1:11:06] unless of course it came from the
[1:11:09] invisibility into the visible and it was
[1:11:12] from the same eternal source that the
[1:11:15] logos came from so you couldn't say
[1:11:17] where did that it actually started it
[1:11:19] only Condon's sin from one form to
[1:11:21] another but it always was
[1:11:23] [Applause]
[1:11:25] it always one starts upon Jesus
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:35] now Jesus has not assigned the trash
[1:11:37] duty in heaven
[1:11:41] he's got to do the bad stuff and pick up
[1:11:44] after everybody
[1:11:45] he's the one who made everybody
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:54] can we go long I'm trying my best to be
[1:11:58] nice and y'all work y'all are doing
[1:11:59] really good from this point on I'm not
[1:12:03] sure
[1:12:06] it was a little like moving that was the
[1:12:11] Word of God
[1:12:12] now God gave him South birth
[1:12:23] which before there was every man Adam or
[1:12:26] air to make an Adam Jesus a glorify me
[1:12:29] Father with the glory that we had before
[1:12:33] the foundation of the world
[1:12:38] you don't remember it nor do i
[1:12:40] but that one out of the eternal you come
[1:12:44] out with it
[1:12:50] John didn't say in the beginning was
[1:12:52] half the word a third of the word a
[1:12:54] tenth of the word but then the beginning
[1:12:56] was the word and if you'll ever be the
[1:12:58] word he was the word David
[1:13:02] notice in Hebrews how many remembers the
[1:13:05] teaching about the Godhead I went back
[1:13:07] and found God like the great rainbow
[1:13:09] with a different spirit how it was and
[1:13:11] then the logos went out of God which
[1:13:14] became the theophany and that was in the
[1:13:18] form of a man
[1:13:20] notice that the kind intention from the
[1:13:22] eternal as it comes into time that
[1:13:24] becomes more visible so God gives birth
[1:13:27] to a son and this form of the logo so
[1:13:30] why light that lighter becomes theophany
[1:13:32] look at his journey look at yourself
[1:13:37] comes from the eternal becomes the word
[1:13:40] later becomes a theophany that you often
[1:13:42] it then becomes a man in a man
[1:13:47] you come out of the eternal in the logos
[1:13:50] follow your siave they are waiting for
[1:13:53] you for we notice of the House of this
[1:13:54] Tabernacle Peter sob we have one already
[1:13:58] waiting
[1:14:00] I already raided why don't we like
[1:14:02] Farber the Dow when the theophany and
[1:14:05] the flash will become one
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:13] Moses in it passed by and the cleft of
[1:14:16] the rock then that theophany was
[1:14:19] absolutely made human flesh
[1:14:23] Christ
[1:14:27] so tell us Shulamite what is your Jesus
[1:14:30] different than a Baptist Jesus
[1:14:34] but Church of God Jesus oral a
[1:14:38] Church of Christ Jesus Lutheran unit
[1:14:41] area Presbyterian

[1:19:25] no one
[1:19:28] I
[1:19:30] love preachers I love great men of God I
[1:19:33] don't know a preacher yet that's ever
[1:19:35] made one star
[1:19:36] there's some great features in this
[1:19:38] message there's some great preachers
[1:19:39] this lived down through time sinky
[1:19:41] Calvin offs Feeny Paul James John
[1:19:43] Bartholomew brother Branham no matter
[1:19:45] who they are I don't know the one that
[1:19:46] ever made one star and threw it out
[1:19:47] there do you
[1:19:49] then why would I want to worship
[1:19:51] something that's inferior and trade off
[1:19:53] him who made every one of them and give
[1:19:55] him all money
[1:19:59] no one
[1:20:03] sounds 1:48 to praise you him all his
[1:20:07] angels praise you him all his hosts

[1:20:32] some language I don't understand moon
[1:20:34] language I don't understand star
[1:20:36] language but I believe today they are
[1:20:39] praising me all night to the Sun somehow
[1:20:42] is his after penetrating and his
[1:20:45] ultraviolet rays are such in there
[1:20:46] somehow in the sun's language the Sun is
[1:20:50] praising the mighty God
[1:20:52] the moon when she comes out tonight she
[1:20:55] will be praising the mighty God when
[1:20:58] Pluto and Mars and Saturn and Eunice and
[1:21:00] all the trillions of stars come out
[1:21:02] tonight they will be praising the mighty
[1:21:05] God
[1:21:05] [Applause]
[1:21:14] can't you see what Satan down to the
[1:21:16] children of Israel once they come out in
[1:21:18] years actually got into their land they
[1:21:21] started worshipping the Sun
[1:21:23] the creation instead of the Creator why
[1:21:28] would you worship the Sun when you could
[1:21:30] worship Him who made many sons but its
[1:21:33] man's wife its man's lie so man will
[1:21:36] worship a gift to get around a pastor
[1:21:37] said preacher somewhere and Riley around
[1:21:39] the gift and follow the lover that gift
[1:21:41] and they fall in love with that more
[1:21:42] than they do the maker of the gift
[1:21:44] himself
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:51] praise Him Sun and Moon praise Him are
[1:21:56] you stars effect praise Him ye heavens
[1:22:01] of heavens
[1:22:03] and you waters
[1:22:05] that be above the heavens
[1:22:10] tell me how David knew there was water
[1:22:13] up there they didn't have the spaceships
[1:22:15] and stuff we've got today
[1:22:17] they didn't have telescopes so what we
[1:22:20] have today
[1:22:21] the anointing that was on David knew it
[1:22:25] without a telescope
[1:22:27] [Applause]
[1:22:29] notices let them praise the name of the
[1:22:33] Lord for he
[1:22:35] commanded and they were created
[1:22:43] not they commanded God the old man has
[1:22:46] already sent away saying maybe she'll
[1:22:48] make it worse you know what daddy that's
[1:22:51] a good idea if your same thing that I
[1:22:53] could help you do daddy I mean I'd be
[1:22:55] glad to but I know of course you you're
[1:22:58] the mighty God and I'm not I'm gonna I
[1:23:00] guess I'm not the mighty God I guess I
[1:23:02] guess I'm just a son I suppose and the
[1:23:05] Holy Ghost and here he's down below me
[1:23:06] his Thrones over here on the side if you
[1:23:09] need any help if there's anything that
[1:23:10] we can do just let us know I
[1:23:14] saw my beloved
[1:23:16] [Applause]
[1:23:18] my beloved look down through the circle
[1:23:20] of eternity and there was nobody there
[1:23:22] but
[1:23:24] God
[1:23:27] he was the only one
[1:23:30] [Applause]
[1:23:39] well the tribes of Indians years ago
[1:23:42] whenever we came to American took their
[1:23:44] place from them
[1:23:46] they called him the only one
[1:23:52] it was the white man who brought to them
[1:23:54] Christianity and divided up God
[1:24:01] he commanded and they were created out
[1:24:05] of what
[1:24:10] God didn't run down to Lowe's and Home
[1:24:12] Depot and Menards and buy up a bunch of
[1:24:15] Stardust in bags we went over to the the
[1:24:18] calcium aisle and the potash and the
[1:24:21] petroleum and the iron oxides and all
[1:24:23] these different things and God went to
[1:24:25] Lowe's and Home Depot and Randy's credit
[1:24:26] card up real high and come out there and
[1:24:28] had all this materials I'll take so much
[1:24:30] of this so much of that so much higher
[1:24:36] what the material come from all
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:41] and it didn't make him all the same he
[1:24:44] didn't make them all the same size
[1:24:48] remember the little nurse around we used
[1:24:50] to say when we were kids twinkle twinkle
[1:24:52] little star how I wonder what you are up
[1:24:57] above
[1:25:05] well I don't wonder any longer
[1:25:09] my God made each one I'm within a
[1:25:12] certain element of a luminosity
[1:25:14] according to the gravitational pull
[1:25:16] inside of each one of these stars and
[1:25:18] the iron oxide and all that that they
[1:25:20] would have they would have a certain
[1:25:22] capacity to reflect more sunlight so he
[1:25:25] didn't make each one of them wear this
[1:25:26] exactly the same just like you don't
[1:25:28] preachers just like he don't Saints but
[1:25:30] he gives each one of a particular
[1:25:32] luminosity so that they're able to
[1:25:34] reflect the Sun because they don't have
[1:25:36] so we look at them and they sparkle and
[1:25:38] all mouths are so beautiful but what are
[1:25:40] they doing they're borrowing their life
[1:25:42] only to God relevant they do not have
[1:25:45] the ability our moon how beautiful she
[1:25:47] is but she is reflecting or bar-ilan
[1:25:49] it's the same with you and I the power
[1:25:52] of Christianity is reflected to us of
[1:25:54] the gospel of the Lord Jesus and he cast
[1:25:57] them about what what protractor what
[1:26:00] measuring tape is big enough to measure
[1:26:02] brother feel from one side of eternity
[1:26:04] to the other side did God use a square
[1:26:07] did God use a level that God use some
[1:26:10] type of great laser thing to be able to
[1:26:12] do it by his word
[1:26:14] [Applause]
[1:26:27] he has also established them
[1:26:30] forever
[1:26:32] never
[1:26:34] he has made a decree
[1:26:37] but shall not pass
[1:26:40] praise the Lord from the earth near
[1:26:44] dragons
[1:26:48] and all deeps
[1:26:53] glory to God
[1:26:56] this is not Jesus
[1:27:02] man is just now finding species and
[1:27:06] certain kinds of fish and creatures down
[1:27:08] in the depths of the ocean one reason is
[1:27:11] because they've never had the equipment
[1:27:14] to be able to go down in the depths of
[1:27:15] the sea because the deeper you go the
[1:27:17] more pressure is created on whatever
[1:27:19] vessel that you're in so now they're
[1:27:21] sending down robotic types of things
[1:27:23] that is built to withstand the pressure
[1:27:25] and they're finding all kinds of
[1:27:27] creatures down there that they never
[1:27:29] even knew was there but he knew they was
[1:27:32] there
[1:27:33] so then why should I make science my god
[1:27:37] when science still don't know hardly
[1:27:39] nothing
[1:27:41] why would I trade off education which is
[1:27:44] constantly changing why would I make
[1:27:47] education my god when it's constantly
[1:27:49] changing why not go to him who made it
[1:27:52] in the first place sure of your
[1:27:55] education sure thank God for what
[1:27:57] science will do until science goes
[1:27:59] contrary to the word
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:08] fire and hail
[1:28:14] and vapor
[1:28:16] stormy wind

[1:28:51] looked at all of them have six sides
[1:28:54] every one of them have a similarity and
[1:28:57] design and in color and every one of
[1:28:59] them has the capability of reflecting
[1:29:02] the light of the Sun and yet here they
[1:29:04] come old science can explain them you
[1:29:06] can watch The Weather Channel you know
[1:29:08] so-and-so's fixing to do so-and-so but

[1:39:07] in the congregation of the Saints sums
[1:39:10] 9065 for all the gods of the nations or
[1:39:13] idols but the Lord has made the heavens
[1:39:17] Psalms 97 6 the heavens declare his
[1:39:20] righteousness
[1:39:21] righteousness
[1:39:23] the heavens declare his righteousness
[1:39:26] right standing was God
[1:39:29] it must be some redeemed up there
[1:39:31] somewhere and all the people shall see
[1:39:35] his glory Psalm 102 25 or of all has
[1:39:39] thou laid the foundation of the earth
[1:39:41] and the heavens are the work of the
[1:39:43] hands proverbs 3:19 the Lord by wisdom
[1:39:47] have founded the earth by understanding
[1:39:50] us established
[1:39:53] heavens
[1:39:56] what is thy beloved more than another I
[1:40:02] ain't got time to take it let's stand
[1:40:20] praise God praise
[1:40:23] God
[1:40:26] friends why would we put anything above
[1:40:28] him
[1:40:29] why would we make any idol
[1:40:32] then give it our utmost and our highest
[1:40:35] when he's the only one that deserves it
[1:40:40] Amen is this let me ask this question is
[1:40:44] this your Jesus
[1:40:49] this dis yo cheese have I described your
[1:40:53] husband
[1:40:56] who's yours some powerless weakling then
[1:40:59] they got enough power I'll tell you one
[1:41:01] thing that wasn't the Jesus Paul wrote
[1:41:02] about
[1:41:03] Paul said he created all things and I
[1:41:06] don't know that all things is created by
[1:41:07] him and for him whether they be
[1:41:09] principalities powers dominions or
[1:41:11] whatever they are the devil thinks he's
[1:41:12] something the devil ain't nothing gods
[1:41:15] have one who brought him in the
[1:41:16] beginning about creation he served God's
[1:41:18] purpose and the purpose is done he'll
[1:41:19] cease to exist
[1:41:22] that's my Jesus
[1:41:29] praise God praise
[1:41:31] God
[1:41:34] thank you Lord
[1:41:37] Lord I realize
[1:41:39] you are so great no wonder your prophet
[1:41:43] told us that if you had not condescended
[1:41:45] it would have blinded even the elected
[1:41:48] but thank you Lord for coming down to
[1:41:53] our level as we say
[1:41:56] condescension is such a great work as
[1:41:59] humans we think more of ascending
[1:42:01] ascending ascending it in gray or higher
[1:42:03] higher higher better better bigger
[1:42:04] bigger that's the way we think but to
[1:42:07] you
[1:42:08] condensation is such a great day for you
[1:42:12] to come into existence in the form of
[1:42:14] sonship it took an active condensation
[1:42:17] for you to come down to Abraham that day
[1:42:20] glory be to God
[1:42:23] and take up the body you spoke yourself
[1:42:27] a desk body and then two angels it was
[1:42:29] an act of condensation
[1:42:31] after you stepped out of that purpose
[1:42:33] and fulfill that mission you let that
[1:42:36] body go back to the dust of the earth
[1:42:37] and went right back and deteriorated
[1:42:40] into the elements
[1:42:41] when the logos became in human form
[1:42:46] he was on your way to gaining your first
[1:42:49] permanent human body
[1:42:51] glory to God
[1:42:53] the Prophet said it in future home this
[1:42:56] is my part of the earth and from this
[1:42:58] part I will redeem the rest of it but
[1:43:03] what was it an act of condensation
[1:43:06] when the Holy Ghost divided himself on
[1:43:08] the pillar of fire on the day of
[1:43:10] Pentecost an act of condensation
[1:43:13] Lord Jesus how great you are
[1:43:16] help us to move beyond our sinking of
[1:43:19] Great Great and stepping on people's
[1:43:20] heads to get higher and higher help us
[1:43:23] to realize that's the way the world
[1:43:24] sinks cosmos
[1:43:26] but our way up is down
[1:43:29] humility we love you Lord Jesus
[1:43:33] there was no one else like you
[1:43:37] though there be gods though there be
[1:43:40] idols though there's been religions Lord
[1:43:43] that had been down through the ages and
[1:43:45] Christianity certainly is not the only
[1:43:47] religion it's not the only one that
[1:43:49] claims their God did this and that and
[1:43:51] the other but were the only one with an
[1:43:53] open tomb
[1:43:55] we can plant back and say he was there
[1:43:58] in an act of condensation he condemned
[1:44:02] sin to death
[1:44:04] but he got up
[1:44:06] praise God
[1:44:08] who did our Jesus if the heavens praise
[1:44:12] you Lord right now the Sun is bright and
[1:44:15] so shining we can't even see the stars
[1:44:18] but they're still there but after a
[1:44:21] while on the Sun sets and it goes down
[1:44:24] as we call it then Lord the stars to
[1:44:26] start coming out Venus evening star
[1:44:28] which is the morning stars well she'll
[1:44:31] come out the first one to herald the
[1:44:32] night as she does the day then the
[1:44:35] others to start peeping out and they'll
[1:44:36] then express herself
[1:44:38] but even when we don't see them the
[1:44:41] praising you
[1:44:42] the worshipping men they have spun out
[1:44:45] in the universe for maybe millions of
[1:44:48] years
[1:44:49] glory to God how long is the Sun the
[1:44:53] great fireball been hanging there the
[1:44:57] moon
[1:44:58] glory be to God and we know bringing our
[1:45:02] son up next to the planet Betelgeuse
[1:45:04] it's like a head of a pen in
[1:45:07] comparison
[1:45:09] planets it's much larger much greater we
[1:45:13] get the son found favor in your eyes
[1:45:16] of all the trillions of stars in our
[1:45:19] universe there's one little speck of
[1:45:22] dust
[1:45:24] but you reflected by giving her a
[1:45:26] certain color that she had found
[1:45:29] heavenly favor
[1:45:30] you colored her in blue
[1:45:33] and blue is a heavenly God
[1:45:38] so when our space people go out and they
[1:45:41] point back and they take pictures of
[1:45:44] this planet what is her predominant
[1:45:47] color blue and they named her the blue
[1:45:52] planet
[1:45:53] her name is written in the Bible this is
[1:45:57] why she cannot be destroyed she is a
[1:45:59] redeemable
[1:46:01] attribute of God
[1:46:05] all glory to God our Lord Jesus
[1:46:10] if the Sun pressures on the moon how
[1:46:14] much more should we hear today Lord I'm
[1:46:16] not just talking about with volume and
[1:46:18] loudness necessarily but from her fear
[1:46:20] Dean Oh Lord God the only thing that's
[1:46:24] out of a cycle
[1:46:27] Pluto Mars Saturn Neptune Orion Pleiades
[1:46:31] all of them are in their original
[1:46:33] position it was only the planet that man
[1:46:36] was given his domain when the man fell
[1:46:39] the earth fell
[1:46:40] when will the Earth's come back when the
[1:46:43] man comes back
[1:46:46] even Lord Jesus your visit to the earth
[1:46:49] you did not bring Earth's for redemption
[1:46:51] back yet you purchased it but you did
[1:46:55] not bring it back because it was not
[1:46:56] just based on your acts alone it was
[1:47:00] based on yours revealed in us
[1:47:03] we can't hear it today but the earth the
[1:47:07] solar system is crying the earth is
[1:47:09] begging for redemption she's waiting for
[1:47:12] the sons of God to come to her place
[1:47:14] their place so she can get her place
[1:47:17] again
[1:47:18] then Lord God at the dawn of that
[1:47:22] seventh morning the Millennium was put
[1:47:25] on hold in the Garden of Eden for on the
[1:47:27] seventh day he rested but man called you
[1:47:30] out of your eaten your millennium so the
[1:47:33] millennium was put on hold it has been
[1:47:36] waiting and the cycle of God's great
[1:47:38] types this is wobbly do not go straight
[1:47:41] from the church ages into eternity the
[1:47:43] Millennium must be lived out glory to
[1:47:46] God Oh
[1:47:47] hallelujah Oh in the dawn of that
[1:47:51] seventh morning is the prophet called it

[1:47:58] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:48:01] hallelujah who stepped out on the new
[1:48:05] earth

[1:48:13] of God
[1:48:15] although there was other boats in that
[1:48:17] day but here's was the only one that was
