man how many just believes that this morning when I get my chance at his throne I don't want to be interrupted by nothing I don't want to be interrupted we won't be interrupted by phones or text or email but when we get our chance of his throne I want to express what he's meant to me I thank him for every day that I was weak that he lifted me up every day that I was sick that he healed me think about what you'll do when you get to that throne oh my what a great time lays ahead forces the Bride of Christ if you have your Bibles this morning would invite you to the scripture of the Matthew chapter 26 Matthew chapter 26 I want to look at verse 36 this morning Matthew chapter 26 I look at verse 36 we'll read down from there this morning we'll give you our subject we'll pray and let you be seated Matthew chapter 26 verse 36 hey man I just love those old songs but oh he talked about old songs I like old songs some of those old songs it's got a lot of meaning behind it I know today they like them seven eleven songs you know what that is don't you about seven words when I sing in eleven times over and no no but I like them old songs I've got some meat and potatoes behind it something good something stick with you Amen something you can sing about from years and years later you're still singing about it amen how many just needs a word of encouragement this morning how many just feels like a balloon sometimes you get the fight he just need filled up well I trust he just feels us this morning then come to Jesus with him to a place called gethsemane and set it to the disciples sit you here while I go and pray under and he took with him Peter into the two sons of Zebedee and begin to be sorrowful and very heavy then Seth hand to them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death so tarry you here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me and nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt now watch what he does next and he cometh unto the disciples and he finds them asleep and he said unto Peter what could you not watch with me just for one hour watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak if Jesus says the flesh is weak the flesh is weak so he went away again the second time and prayed saying my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done watch verse 43 and he came again and found him asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went away again and he prayed the third time once you glad that you know Jesus prays about something more than once and he prayed the third time saying the same words that sounds like me and been cometh he to his disciples and said unto them sleep on now take your rest behold the hour is at hand that the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners and then he said rise and let us be going behold he is at hand that death betrayed me let's just buy our hearts what I like to speak on this morning is the world's greatest battlefield the world's greatest battleground Heavenly Father we love you Lord with all of our hearts we are thankful that you've allowed us to be able to be assembled together this morning and Lord we just look to you in the promises of your words Lord you know every need in this building Lord you know every heart and we're asking that you would take your word Lord and I your word my use scanners and searches this morning lord I ask that you would come and help us to be able to yield ourselves to you not just me but each one that has come Lord we pray that this service Lord that's something to be said that would be edifying to us Lord we're living in a wicked age we're living in a wicked time where there's pressure all around us there's problems everywhere we look Lord there's problems in our homes problems in the church problems in the world problems in aren't we are just looking to you know and Lord you're the answer to every need that we'll ever have so we look to you this morning and pray Lord that you would come among us in a great way may you take break the word to us as you did many years ago and when he broke the bread their eyes come open may our eyes come open this morning to the word of life we pray in Jesus Christ's name and everybody said a man god bless you this morning you may be seated may the Lord had his blessings to the reading of his word I want to read to you this morning to get our hearts going a certain direction in the scripture I want to read how the message desperation 1963 is where we'll get our our subject from also from the message communion 1957 but I'll make some of the remarks we're gonna look at but he makes a statement in desperation and he says our dear Lord Jesus himself in the world's greatest battleground the world's greatest battleground Gethsemane he cried out in despair should he take the sins of the world or so he just remained on earth with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do but watch his humility as he humbled himself he said not my will but mine been done he humbled himself to the word and the promised Word of God of heaven and notice then he went a little further if he went a little further how much more ought we to go a little further and notice the scripture says here in the loop that he prayed earnestly brother sister if Jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if Christ the God of heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly then how much more that we sinners saved by grace pray earnestly if the decision throw the son of God into despair what will it do to you and I desperately we must cry we understand this moment in Gethsemane is unlike any other place that we would read in the scripture of Jesus's life in this place in the script the passion of this moment so captivates me and I'm amazed by what I read here in Matthew 26 I'm amazed the hell that Jesus is able to divide and separate divinity from humanity and we see that this thing that's going to take place is we are been taught about in the scripture over and over again for years and years this is where Jesus's life had come this is why his ministry has been sent for and has been brought to and now it brings Jesus to the greatest place that he would ever be in his life the greatest moment that would ever take place after all the miracles that Jesus had done after all the people that had been touched by the Ministry of the Lord after all the things that Jesus had had done and had prayed and had said after all the teaching that had been done after all the things that had amazed the people that Jesus would speak to not only was Jesus we see not only is Jesus our Savior not only is he our Redeemer but Jesus is also our teacher amen a lot of people want Jesus as Savior they want him as a miracle worker they want him as a healer but Jesus is also our teacher we can take his life and be taught by what demand the human the humanity was able to do and we see here is Jesus and how he comes to this place in his ministry and you know it's a it's amazing for me after all the great things that had been done how that I would so have loved to be able to see it and hear Jesus preach the gospel how amazing that would have been to be able to sit there and hear his words and how that he presents things and says it in a certain way a way that no other preacher has ever said you believe that a way that no other teacher has ever sent it oh my how I would have loved to be able to hear him preach I would have loved to be able to stand there at the tomb of Lazarus when jesus walks to that tomb in his little small frail body and then he removes his shoulders back and begins to speak to that tune to a body that was dead inside that grate and to see Lazarus come out of that grave dressing those great I would have loved to have seen that I would have loved to seen Jesus be able to take and speak to the wind and to be able to speak to the water you talking about a powerful preacher a man that can stand on the bow of the boat and speak to win and speak to water two parts hydrogen one part oxygen and water and hydrogen obey what Jesus says you're talking about a powerful preacher when the wind obeys what a man says when the very water of the world had been created by the creator of heavens and earth stood on the ballot that boat that water had to give way to the words of Jesus I would have loved to stand there and watched him as he takes him from his tired body from preaching the meetings and how he stood there and the people was scared to death but yet Jesus knew who he was hallelujah jesus knew who he was and he stands there and speaks the word just seemed take as a boy was coming to a camp as he has skipped school that way and as he moves into this camp he takes that little Snoopy lunchbox and takes out some bread and takes out some fish and begins to multiply that bread right in his hand I would have loved this 10 there and watches that bread materialized when he breaks one piece off in another piece appears and he breaks another piece off in another piece of fear I would have loved to have seen that I would have loved to be in there that day that when Jesus walked by that fig tree and that fig tree was not producing fruit like it's supposed to be producing and to see Jesus speak to that fig tree and he cursed the very roots of that tree and that tree begin to wither away I would have loved to seen it when Jesus went to the wedding that day and he breached down in that water and he turned the water into wine I would have loved to been there I would have loved to been identified with it I would have loved to seen it and the reason we love those things it's because that's the divinity of the Lord Jesus that's something we can't relate to we can't relate to take bread and also fine I've never done it and I doubt you have either we can't relate to a God that allows the wind and the water told me but to hear those things we love to hear it preached we love to hear it preached about and talked about there's been a million sermons and has been wrote about the divinity of Jesus it's because the divinity of Jesus is the very opposite of our lives it's the opposite of what we do it's the office I've been yet we love him for this creators as sons of God we long for that position we love for that authority of the word of God we love to come to that place that the wind has to obey us as Eve spoke that day in the garden and when Adam begins to speak to that we're because it was the desire of Eve I'm amazed at the power of God I'm amazed at the how that God can do things the way he doesn't but really what we need help with is not the divinity of Jesus but I submit to you what we need help with is the humanity of Jesus everybody loves to preach about feeding 5,000 everybody loves to hear about the great healing campaigns everybody loves to hear of the signs and the wonders and the miracles and as long as Jesus was doing those things the crowds was following him around the crowds followed they loved as a matter of fact they was there to see the miracles done they was there to see the signs and the wonders performed they was there to see Jesus lay his hands on people that's crippled and they get up and walk they're there to watch Jesus lay his hands over on blinded eyes and though eyes would just come open at the very creation of the creator that's why the crowd was following him they wanted to see signs they wanted to see wonders they wanted to see these things but come a time hallelujah in Jesus's ministry where all of that was going to take a backseat what would happen next would be different than anything he had ever done what would happen next what's gonna be taken a man whose eyes sockets is there with no eyeballs and Jesus would take mud and wipe it in the man's eyes and he would create eyes how to merge that's not what gets him knees about guess simile is not about miracles so that sighs it's not about winders it's about humanity suffering he come to this place in this ministry the place of Gethsemane and when you come to this flesh every one of us no matter how long you serve God no matter how long you believe this message every one of us will have to go through a guest simony guest simony is not a place of shouting guests see me is not a place of great themes taking Gethsemane is actually a place of separation people will not stay forget simony crowds will not be gathered forget simony there's not going to be hundreds and thousands of people lined up to see Gethsemane gasps simony has no attraction to it oh but let me tell you if you are a true disciple of Jesus Christ you're going to stay with him through the thick and the fence whether it's signs and wonders or miracles you're going to be there no matter how it's taking place you're a true disciple and you're following him no matter watch too many people serve God out of circumstance preach brother David as always everything is going good we believe God loves everything's going fine we're in revival long as everything is doing the way we think it should be your and everything's being said the way we think it should be said we are happy but let me tell you let sensor we must serve God more than just circumstances what will you do the enemy turns your life upside down what would you do when you face the greatest trial your life how are you overcome during those times people want perfect circumstances we can shout with the best coupling gods pouring out the blessings we can lift our hands and praise God and thank God for it whenever the blessings is coming out but let me tell you what are you gonna do when great trouble strikes your heart what are you going to do when you face the trial there Gethsemane of your life and you don't have nowhere else to turn and it seems the heavens is like brass and you can't get an answer from God at that time brother what will you do then we're a god we love God because of circumstances sometimes you know what I hate I hate false presentations don't you I hate looking at something that's being advertised to be this but when you actually get it it's something else have you ever went through a drive-thru window and you're going through that job through a window and you look up there and you're trying to decide between the cheeseburger and the salad and you know you need to sell it but you want the cheeseburger and you look up there and man that salad looks so good and the lettuce looks so fresh everything looks rotten man those tomatoes on there they look so fresh and so wrong man they are just perfect and how they got a little bit of dude dripping off the pieces of the lettuce and you're thinking man that's what I'm gonna have and you pull around to the drive-through window and they hand you a bag out the window and you take that bag and you open it up and you take the lid off that salad and it's brown and you pick up the tomato and they have given you the very end of the tomato and you're looking at this sound and it's dry there's no moisture on and you know why it's not presented as it was advertised I'm afraid that we have presented this gospel to look so good and so pretty too many preachers are preaching upon the sky and the vine by their preaching no trouble no problems Oh child nothing going wrong by the NATO a mile we thought he'll every day we find sickness and trouble everywhere we look they are coming against us in the garden there's no Crouch there's no masses of people there's not five thousand to be fed in the garden there's no one to be healed but when Jesus comes to the garden he comes to the garden alone alone he made argue that the cross was the greatest moment in all history not dance a man for that today the cross was amazing it was on the cross that my sins was paid in full it was on the cross that my debt paid it was actually canceled because of the cross it was there that every hope of every believer become eternal because a price that was paid on the cross it was at the cross that every curse was broken it was there at the cross at the scene was actually defeated it was at the cross that justice collapsed itself into the arms of mercies where they're having at the cross it was at the cross that the priests become the lamb is at the cross but let me submit to you the cross was settled before the first nail ever hit Jesus think about it before there was a crown of thorns foot on his head there was already a decision that was made the cross was conquered before he ever went to Pilate Hall and the cross had already been conquered where to become conquered and the greatest battleground the world has ever seen the greatest battleground it is not Iraq the greatest battleground it's not Afghanistan the greatest battleground it's not Syria the greatest battleground for you and me it's Gethsemane let's cross the cross wasn't settled on a tree oh god that's good it wasn't settled on a tree in public display for everybody to see I got a reason I'm saying that because the struggle of the will of God for your life it isn't settled on a public display of power hello you're somebody but our struggle is settled in our private gardens in our private gardens it's where our troubles are settled at it's in our private gardens it's where we submit ourselves to the will of God it's in our private gardens it's where everything finds a way to overcome is in our garden it's in our private gardens is where we wrestle with God's will oh not me brother David oh yes you and me we wrestle with him we talk to him we talk back to him but not me I never do that I do because there's things I want answers to that I can't get answers to and we're saying God why did you allow this have you ever best the question why Lord why did this happen why did that happen why did this take place why did that take place listen friends God knows what you need to go through to bring the best out of you it's in the garden that your will and he's actually combined and settled to lay his will be done it's in the garden that we asked God why don't you speak to me don't you say something to me Lord why have you gone this long without doing something for me why have you went this long without giving me some leadership why have you went this long without speaking no spill those feel small voice how long to hear that voice how long to hear those words what are you hear that and I am the great healing campaigns it ain't in the midst of shouting it's not to miss the miracles it's in our Gardens is where we hear it ash hitting our private moments it's during those times that all of our Francey prayers are put behind us all of our deeds and our veils preached mother David it's laid behind us when we swap our remote language for reality you ever seen some people prayed man they get up there they wanted some man I can pray like none other and I can say the words just perfect how articulate my words so good listen friends when you get in the garden you're not worried about who hears you you're not worried about what words you use or how people thinks how pretty you can pray when you come to the garden you come to The Garden alone it's real it's just you and God there ain't no show to be put on for nobody there ain't nobody watching whether you raise your hand or not there's nobody watching whether you worship or not there's nobody watching you see if you're entering the service or not when you come to your garden it's just you and God God's looking to you and I can feel your God that's where we come and say God my tank is empty Lord I feel like I have run plumb out my joy is gone my peace is gone god I need you and if you don't come through for me at this moment I don't know what I'm gonna do god I lead you right now I know you've done things in the past I know you've done things for me great taste Lord but I lead you worse right now than what I've ever needed you before it's in our spiritual gardens that we become like Jacob of the Old Testament it's where we begin to wrestle with God and we say God I need you so bad and your wrastlin what do our ask them with why is it so hard it's because you're fighting your very own humanity you're fighting your very own mindset you're fighting your own theology that lays up in your head and you wrestle with it just like I wrestle with it just like Jesus wrestles with it just like the Prophet wrestle with it you like Jacob begin to wrestle with those wheels even though it's so painful it's at those moments that divinity and humanity begins to fuse together Jesus didn't just give us a picture of divinity he give us a picture of his human part the flesh of a man the humanity of a man that would suffer the humanity of a man that would cry outside the city on top of a hill that would weep a man that would cry was Russo man that would watch her grave and cry as the tomb of Lazarus because his friend had died that's not divinity that's his humanity hallelujah because he knew us and he knew if all we saw was the divinity and the miracles and the great things in the signs and the wonders that's something I can't relate to I can't relate to just to Jesus with all powers I cannot relate to just to Jesus it walks upon the water I can't just relate to Jesus that would cleanse the liver and the left we're going running down the street doing the law to see I can't relate to that but when you talk about a man struggling with his own self when you talk about a man that has a will of his own to be able to make a choice whether you talk about a man that's in desperate need and needs something from God that's something I can relate to God let us see something we can identify with I know how we are we rejoice around the miracles dureena there ain't anything greater I love to preach on then to preach about the miracles for what Jesus done we love to read about Jesus healing the sick raising the dead I'll tell you friends what I need to look at is how human he is sometimes amen I need to look how loving he is I need to see how he cries I need to see how compassionate he is listen Church it's in the garden there ain't gonna be no walking on water there's no more healing the sick there's no display great power where people is awed by what he does but it's here it gets M&E i feel my preacher coming on man it's here at Gethsemane it's really what you really are Oh friends how I would love for God to come in this service this morning and pull back the mask of our humanity pull back our I'm pretty smiles and our long hairs and get right behind those masks and lay all of that aside and get really getting real with Jesus for a few moments and let you know I'm a real person that's got real needs and we're old troubles we come to church and sometimes we come here and we put a display on but really who are you what are you going through when you sit on that to you why don't you listen to what are you hear when you hear the word preached I pray God would be getting behind our smiles and our long hair and dig down into our hearts to who we really are brother sister we've come too late just to come to this building and play Church hallelujah you can't sit here and be a pretender listen days of pretending is over the days of make-believe in the church is over we are here to prove who's really got the goods who's really going to fight when it's time to fight I say to you this morning it's in your guests ebony that proves what you really are guess seemingly means the place oppressing it's the place of squeezing that that's what Gethsemane means it means the place of constriction the literal meaning Gethsemane meaning and oprah's that's what the name Gethsemane means it's an old fresh it's an old fresh not a miracle press a man an oil press I guess simile history says there was a large number of great bats and all of trees that's surrounded Gethsemane the Gethsemane is the private place that Jesus would go to to have personal times between him and the Father I'm told and guests in his history says they will have great round match and they would take the olives and even grapes and they would pour it into that branch and then what would happen is they would even take great bachelors and be able to take and squeeze those olives or they would actually get into the bat itself and begin to put them underneath their feet and crush them all as and crush them until finally all the oil runs out of that great listen very closely putting pressure on the olive forces the oil out of it amen brother David putting stress on me all of hallelujah putting stress on the Olive forces the all-out constricting the olive constricting all of a such pressure but such pressure forces although all that lays in the skin of the olive who glory although all that lays under that skin lays in that olive and they gotta press it to get it out of it we're at brother David the garden I guess cemani the Garden of Gethsemane I asked my wife I said if I ask you how much does olive oil cost what would you say I wonder what would you say this morning some would say three some would say four dollars right maybe three dollars for a bottle of olive oils four dollars for a bottle of olive oil I don't know I don't shop much she all right sending me there anyway I always buy too much cuz if I figure if we need one gallon milk today I'll just go get go ahead and get two so I don't have to go back but I say how much does olive oil cost and I said this why would I ask you how much olive oil cost because if I really want to know how much olive oil cost shouldn't you ask the olive shouldn't you ask the olive because the olive is the only warm Florida god that knows really how much it costs to get the olive in that jar I don't know the island knows what it feels like to be caressed and squeezed to get the olive oil out of it and Jesus comes to the garden alone he comes to a place of constriction he comes to the place of the press he comes to the place of pressure he comes to the squeeze it's the hour of the squeeze Wow because God's got to bring something out of him that's some wool it's gonna have to get poured out in this Gethsemane no crowds to see it no miracles no healing campaigns no discerning the hearts no telling somebody what's wrong with him hallelujah listen very carefully no Spirit of God on him no spirit of God on him he come to The Garden alone rising the Sun 1965 spirit left him am I going to get simony in the Garden of Gethsemane he didn't leave him at the cross it left him at the garden he had to die Amanda give adoption but I'm sitting in the garden of evening they're going to get simony the anointing left him you know he had to die as a sinner he died a sinner you know that not his sins but mines and yours Jesus had to come to the place to get squeezed in order to bring glory Jesus had to be pressed because God knows the greater the pressure the greater the treasure God knows how much pressure to put up on us listen friends that's the reason why you should warn every enemy of your life you should tell them thank you for putting pressure on me come on church you should send them a thank-you card because the pressure they're putting on you it's just bringing all out of your life you said said thank him go ahead keep on talking about me keep on talking about me he's not like looking down me keep on tweeting you little tweener team don't charge for a little burn you're bringing glory out of me you want to talk about me go ahead you want to run me down go ahead you're breaking great all out of my life because you see the more pressure you put on me the greater the old God presses out of me and by the way this ain't my first garden this ain't my first rope on somebody I'm bi I had been through fame before I've been through trouble before I've been through trials before I'm getting this died before I've been here enough to know that if he was with me then he's gonna be with me now I know if he didn't leave me then he ain't gonna leave me now I know if he was there in the days gone by he's the same yesterday today and forever he's right here present today I say at 3:00 in the morning he's there I say it 2:00 in the afternoon he's there I'm telling you on your lunch break he's there with you when you're crying out when it's just you and God alone he's there for you my brother and sister I say squeeze on I say squeeze own because I know whether I say that or not he's gonna squeeze anyway I don't ask God for troubles I don't ask God for trials I don't even ask God for tests don't look at me strange I'm sure you don't either how many of you woke up this morning so god I wish you'd see me the nastiest test there ever has been lord I want something that'll buck of me palm down to my knees right think every friend the world has let me know what I want to be pressed I don't pray that it never will pray that because that's not my desire but I know because I know whether I prayed or not he's gonna let it happen anyway he's making gold for the kingdom brother and sister I said he's making gold for the kingdom he knows in order to make good gold you got to be put to the fire he knows in order to make good gold you're gonna have to go through some beatings and some tests squeeze own squeeze own because I know when all the squeezing is done I know when all my guests simians over and all the pressures done I know that no weapons formed against me is gonna prosper I know that greater is He that is in me and he that is in my trouble he that is in my sickness satisfied or at me all I contains is Paul did if God be for us who can be against us if God's for me tell me what trial why presser what squeeze what gasps seven a horse it happen at in the garden did you know the Bible is a story of two Gardens that's all this it's a story of two gardeners the Garden of Eden and the Garden of Gethsemane in the first Arden Adam took a fall in the second Garden Jesus took a stand in the first Gardens Adam listen Adam hid from God and God had a son Adam but because of the second Garden Jesus Christ emerged from the tune and he come looking for me in the first garden there was a man because of a tree cause man to die in the second garden because of man made a decision he went to a tree and won back the rights of every son and daughter of God oh dear friends I tell you because I guess seemingly Jesus went to a tree to give every son and daughter of God everlasting up inside of your hearts it's because of a tree it's in the garden it's in the garden that the will a man superseded the will of God think about it but it's in the we it's in the garden that the will of man got superseded by the will of God this time it wasn't man over on God's will it was God over on man's will it's because of the garden because of the garden friends I know there's things about this we don't like hearing but the persecution is the only thing that can bring God's glory out of you it's not how many worship songs you memorize it's not how many quotes you know it's not how much for the Bible that you can quote for instance when you get pressure and squeeze by god it's the attack on your life that brings the all out it's the attack on my life that brings the glory out anybody can worship and everything is good okay we're not if you can't come in this church when we're singing to worship it and put your hands and there's something wrong with you listen friends it's easy to come in here when you got this many people praising God you can let your hair down for a little bit and lift your hand but what about when you come to the garden and there ain't nobody to pat you on the back there ain't nobody give you an attaboy that you can make it that you can overcome it and you come there and you're by yourself and you're being squeezed and you're being pressed and you feel like eating out a friend in the world that's who you really are real glory is expressed when there ain't nothing going right for you and it feels like Hills moved into your house can we get real for a minute just like your little message Church all that aside just for it and just get real with God when you know that there's hell in your home and there's trouble everywhere you look and the bills are piling up and the credit card debt is there and you don't know what you're going to do god he's pressing you and most of these things are not trials from the front it's usually stuff we do to ourselves Jesus comes to the garden he prays three times and now he knows he's never done nothing wrong he's never done nothing wrong he's never sinned he's never drunk alcohol as we'd say he's never went out and done things wrong he's a perfect lamb but being a perfect liam god had reversed the curse from the original gardens and now he comes to this garden to win back the original garden mother don't you realize it was in the garden of gethsemane that the garden of eden after the Millennium can be restored because of what happened in Gethsemane there's no millennium without a Gethsemane let me preach to you a minute there's no millennium but that I guess cemani a man it's at Gethsemane at the wheel how the father has got to take over brother I'm sitting conferences now hurry let's go to another it's called Gethsemane conference terrible conference watch programs words he didn't have to die a young man he didn't have to do it again he said kid he came to Gethsemane father the father had to check up to see if he really wanted to go through it or not again Jesus brought himself to a decision before going to Calvary the father brought his son and to a conference in Gethsemane and while the angels was taking nerf is their position to see what decision would be oh it might not have been this way but let's just think maybe it was I could hear him say son do you desire to go to Calvary there's a band waiting on you there's persecution there's death and murder laying in the way there's even exposure of your own body they'll strip the clothes off of you they'll beat you to a pulp now put a crown of thorns over your head you will die screaming for mercy what's the question should you go on should you go on should you go on Jesus is in the garden wrestling with what he should do he's only 33 years old he's only 33 we say he's got his whole life ahead of him as we would look at him as a man he's just young but the choice is his it's a decision I said it's a decision he comes to the garden he brings three people with him he knows there's something ahead of him he knows her something waiting for him he's got something for the rim said it's weighing on his mind so he comes to this garden in here here he's gonna fight there's gonna be a war between his humanity and his divinity Jesus is in the garden you got to see the picture this is the whole point of the sermon he comes to this garden the disciples are here and here Jesus as they come in Jesus asked us the disciples just pray with me please just pray with me just pray for an hour just pray with me watch Frank and the Bible says Jesus will father so here's the disciples on one side here Jesus goes a little further to the other side Jesus goes there and he kneels down and he begins to talk to the father about what his will is listen now the will of God was Calvary the will of God was nails the will of God was thorns on his head the will of God was to be beat the will of God was to go there to be public but in public this lands shame that is the will of God listen the will of God was not going to move God was not changing his will his will was Calvary so Jesus comes and he's praying to the Father what his will would be Lord what would you have me do and God tells him the wheel it's gaga's the will is for you to take and to be carried outside the city and crucified on the town's garbage dump that is the will of God Jesus bumps into the will of the Father and the will of the Father doesn't move so as a man as a man he gets up and he goes back to humanity come on somebody he comes to lean upon humanity and guess what humanity fails him get mad he has a slate body he needs them to pray he needs to him he wants to lean on him he wants to get something from them drop something but when he leans to that humanity humanity is not a leaning post they're laying down asleep and Jesus says can't you just pray with me just for an hour just for an hour watch and pray it's the hour of temptation leaves humanity goes back to divinity and he starts praying Lord what is it - will a god ain't moving don't misunderstand me the will of God it's not moved by tears it's not moved by his suffering I want you to hear that it's not moved because you feel bad it doesn't move because you might be depressed he was oppressed he was suffering in his body and the will of God was not moving can I say it it's not going if custom fits your heart the will of God doesn't custom fit what you're going through how you feel trying to make you feel better the one guy so he prays grace and he gets up because the will of God is not moving because he goes back to the disciples and humanity again don't you understand what I'm telling you when you try to depend on it and you try to lean on it and you think you got a little something and you try your best to lean upon it it'll fail you every time all right you just watch don't you just watch don't you realize what I'm going through like some four times I'm sorry just man it's just it's a peaceful here and it's so relaxing here and man it's just I can't hardly keep my eyes open I don't understand it but if spirit of sleepers come over me Lord and I don't know how to get out of this heater just watch watch pray with me the font listen friends the humanity is asking humanity just pray with me just what you pray for me would you remember me when you Frank why is he saying it he's in desperation he's desperate he's desperate he knows my like that please no God no to the Father's will if you changed your wheel has your word changed he knows better I said he knows better has your wheel how many times do we do it as you will change it as there is another way is there a way around this Lord no do I got yes this there's no Calvary without a winning gethsemane believe it or not that would have never been a Calvary let's hit one the battleground and Gethsemane the only way around this is to have a kingdom without a Calvary that's the only way around it is to have a kingdom without Calvary but guess what a kingdom without Calvary doesn't involve you and me it involves one man without sin it tears me up to think there's only white bad he praised so hard the Bible says his water and his blood separated him a try Joseph takes over his body where literally it's a it's a medical condition where he's put under such pressure so much pressure Sal my dresser that blood literally pours from the pores in his face it drips from his body Cuba treacherous the definition literally means one put her so much agony and pressure that it separates the water from the blood and besides water pouring out in your sweat glands Brad begins to drop down he's not there some halfway prayer oh let me preach to you right there it stuns not it ain't some two-second prayer before you go to bed or some halfway prayer but he's there in agony and pain and so much pressure and so much pressure he's been over he's got his face on the ground and he's crying out to God God what is it Lord must I go this way is this what I have to do Sal that's right sir blood begins to run down his chin down his clothes one drop after another so much pressure so much pressure so much pressure why he didn't get simony what that's just silly it's the Olive Press and in that Olive Press the will of God and the man humanity is pressing human pressing here until blood begins to run from his pores Jesus do you got a choice yes cuz here chose not to yes clear chose another way yes can you choose other ways sometimes without seeking the will of God how much your humanity how many times have we tried to bypass what we know we know it's God's will we know there ain't no way around it but we come and we play with God sometimes and we toy with them when God's will ain't moving somewhere deep within Jesus his father what's the Lamb what's the lamb not the priest not the high priest not the king what's the lamb sir watch the lamb the lamb humbles himself he's his father not my will the vanity has to give in to what humanities asked and humanity is asking for the father's wheel you fell on his face and prayed saying father what's the man if it's possible you know why that sounds just like me of you nor please maybe there's another way maybe I can do this different like there's another way to handle this or as we do sometimes Lord I'll just put this on the back burner and just forget it for a little while and the will of God I ain't checking shoot he approaches the Father he's asking him he's asking me and what's God say God don't say nothing what do you do when God don't say nothing what do you do when God is silent what do you do you lay yourself at the father's feet Lord this cup is bitter let's get us a heart let's skip stuff maybe there's another wheel finally he realized God ain't gonna change his mind about his word and he says Lord what do you do when God don't say nothing to you I'll tell you what we do we bounce off of the will of God and we start leaning on humanity hoping humanity can bail us out how many times have we pinned depend on our humanity to bail us out of situations and every time you try to lean on it he fails you Amen somebody every time you sit in your recliner pick your Bible up in your hand you know what happens your humanity fails you don't like it I know because it's right where I live that what happens when we lay down or not we put on a tape and you fall asleep your humanity wins the war Jesus is battlin he needs help but there's no help and he's pushed back and forth and back and forth squeezing him squeezing him he goes from one to another to another and till he's so pressed between them heaven seems like brass and it seems like God ain't here in one prayer from his lips but the only thing he don't understand is is God ain't saying that them because his word ain't changed and Jesus gets so pressed between humanity and divinity it presses him so hard this is the message this mornin it presses him so hard that out of the life of Jesus one drip after another was all comes dripping out of his mouth because he's so pressed in between he's God's got his man God's got humanity underneath his feet and he presses him until all begins to run out of Jesus and that stream of all runs from Gethsemane it runs down to pilots halt and out of pilots halt it runs down those streets down that Via della Rossa it runs outside the city to the town garbage dump and it ends right there at Calvary it's a stream whom he believes that God knows what you can take God knows what he's got to put you through to get all to run out of your life hallelujah I'm glad God didn't give us our way sometimes I'm glad God don't answer all my prayers because some of my prayers are farsighted or nearsighted I'm not looking at it right if humanity if we can lean on humanity every time we don't even need God if we can depend on our flesh and our humanity and how good it is and how perfect we don't even need a Calvary but because every time I need him the most he falls short every time so God just keeps pressing me and pressing me and dressing me until he starts allowing that all to flow listen friends when he was in the garden he was there brother brems said the tempter come up before him saying this is what you're gonna get forgiven your life to the Father do you mean this is what you're gonna get out of it how many times does the devil told you that do you mean this is what your life is done you mean you lose a loved one in a car wreck you live here you lose your loved one to a heart attack or something this is what you're gonna get out of it you lose a loved one to disease and this is what you get for serving God she says is this really what you deserve all you have to do is ask and all this leaves right now and the tempter comes up right before you just give in you can't do this you can't make this you can't make a rapture you can't be an overcomer you can't go on Amen somebody body changed you can't make a body change if you'll just give in this all go away this will all go away if you'll just give in is this really fair is this really fair that one man would die for everybody else how fair is that how fair is that that you should have to do this for all humanity just say it just say it and we'll take you out of the press or take you out of it and Jesus says the will of humanity was to get out of it the well humanity was to find another way but not my will that communion 1957 I'll hurry that's exactly the way he does you and I just before the great bow life starts before the great battle of right and wrong which begins to settle battle within us God brings us to a guest's M&E God didn't spare his own son he'll not spare us you and I from the testing of Jesus was confronting the greatest test that he ever had yes sin he lay just before him without once and final sufficient test must come when the birds of the entire world laid us on the shoulders brother branham come to a place in his ministry to where he had to leave the Baptist Church and God was going to take that ministry and put the remember that the shuk actually had life in it at that term and brother Rams ministry had to go through the shuk in order to produce the seed so he goes to mr. waka and as he goes to mr. Walker of course he gets all the invitations and he comes back to his wife and he says honey cream of the crop there's soy Sol about he's got invitations all over the United States and she took and told her mother and his mother-in-law said I'll not have my daughter associated with such trash like that get out there and shake and jump around and hustle me in the spirit and talk in a different language my daughter around that trash you don't know what ma'am but yesterday we all know the random accessory it's fine that's fine I won't worry about this fine I don't want to cause any problems that's fine the will of God was not gonna move for that Malachi for ministry the will of God was to go through the Pentecost to move a man somebody had to be the restoration of gifts in order to bring the opening the words he has it out there Pentecost and you've gotta count those penny counts to not denominational experience [Applause] it yes no Eli gods who will a God wasn't gonna move her brother branham the will of God had to be done he's saying a man's ministry this is God's mouthpiece it seems like everything calms down OS fine was fine we won't go we won't go and brother REM comes to the place where a flood yes God calls a flood to hit and brother branham was going down them Falls remember down the cataracts he's trying to get that motor started remember his wife and baby is there and they pick him up and they take him up north he runs and tries to find them he finds him finally in a hospital they got meningitis and his dying he runs in there to find his wife remember Bertram said she come back to and she said Bill I know we made our biggest mistake yet we should have never listened to my mama promise me bill you promise me you'll go back and preach that Holy Ghost the rest of your life what was it when she come back she missed I identified what happened to mr. Walker was something she's seen on the other side Lorna Collett hey man the pebble leaves his wife she dies his heart store of his chest 23 years old she's 23 years old the day that God would never do it he'll put you or you're supposed to be at whether you like it or not 23 years old she's dead because of the doctor says we're my baby yet Billy I hate to tell you this but the baby's been feeding from its mama it's attractant that meningitis is well through its mama and you can't go see that baby Billy you do you'll track that the Billy Paul he's already sick don't you do it doc you don't understand I've got to see my baby doctor says you can't you just stand by the REM said remember he said I went down the stairs down into that basement he said I got down there he said the screen was off the window and flies had become matted around the baby's eyes so I went dinner and a pic that maybe up in my arms I'm looking at the baby and the baby's drawled up under such intense pressure upon this may be why the baby why must I get it ever dude hey Sanford agony body was drawn up under seizures of great pressure and pressure to finally brother he looks at it and he said those beautiful blue eyes they used to smile at meet that blue eye under such pressure begins to turn me in because the pressure is so so hard upon the baby its eyes begin to cross but resting God what are you doing what are you doing to me she's only 9 months old please God please is there another way is there another way God is our habit [Music] lift this car let this cup pass from me please God no anything but this I want to raise this girl I want to be raised for me a young beautiful young woman your eyes were to start God please anything but this [Music] baby Caesar doesn't seize it up and seize it up what in God's will didn't move so he went back and leaned upon humanity and humanity let him down a road that could only bypass that wheel for so long until the submissive wheel would have to be brought back to the gods perfect wheel there's no mountain happy valley there's no way around it I'm down on my knees with the doors closed father third ladies my wife my baby's mother laying under the Undertaker's more Billy pulls down the bed sick here's my baby dying surely Lord you won't take her I love her she resembles her mother I want to raise her won't you please o God to spare my baby's life do you see the prayer and I looked up and you know I've always been subject to visions so when he sees this vision he says it seemed like a black sheet just rode down and unbowed it coming down and Barbara makes this statement God throwed my prayer God took my prayer and throwed it it right back in my face I know people today because they feel like their prayers got thrown back in their face they leave this message and never serve God again I know a man because they went through a divorce his wife divorce and that's Biddeford now 30-something years this man's never walked back in a church door because he bites God his divorce back in your face some people said that's it heist irony so get back in my face what have I done God have my trained aggressor laws I should have this punishment Jesus revealing our again I'll do anything but don't take my baby I see she was going anyhow and I raised up and the tempter came and the tempter came there was the one time in all my life that I can call was the crucial moment watch what he says my guests M&E when I was just barely holding on to the bed the devil said there you are is that the reward for trying to serve Him in this something how the devil can have such a good argument when you feel so low and so down and you're so sensitive that moment your feelings are running so so sensitive to anything anybody says is that really what you're gonna catch do you mean to tell me to take that 22 year old mother and lay her you nerdz a corpse in the morgue and take that precious baby of your own flesh and blood and slammed your prayer right in your face and you mean to tell me you're gonna serve Him after that the room said I was standing between two opinions what he says I was standing between two opinions it had to be decided I put my hand over on her little head and I said the Lord gave and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of art do you know what it takes to say that do you know what it takes when you got this baby that you've watched around the house crawl around the house as it was and it's around the house and you play with it the mornings and you can try to hold it the evenings and now the baby is under such cruciate pain it's died with its eyes crossed in your arms Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord I said show you honey daddy cannot go with you where you are now but they'll come someday I'll let you on the arm shoes mother and I'll bear you daddy I'll see you again someday the Olive Press between two opinions squeezed and squeezed until finally he gives them to the little gulped because there was no way around great things is birth through much suffering much pain much agony like Calvary the all I like Gethsemane to all ran out and calls the Calvary and because of this moment out of this pressing of this olive out of crushing of this olive came the message of the hour see friends it has to be this way because God said he was going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle God said he was going to have a paypal and there's no other way but to press him and tell the all run and the message was going to come for us the world's greatest battleground it ain't our shoutings it ain't our glory to God it's when we submit to the Father's will and say God not my will but I've done many times you've you had your prayer so back in your face when you've asked God over and over again please God please God anything got anything but this please Lord anything but this how many times have you prayed about something and it looks like everything's gonna be just fine everything goes just fine and it turned around at those back in your face and you're back at the starting point a trusted product restitch what's her situation just recently where I've been praying and praying earnestly before God laying before him thinking man this is gonna be alright this this is gonna come out it's gonna be okay totally find out a few days later Lord I Drive home sometimes at night so tired I find myself running off the road why is it I go in labor and pray for your children be honest somebody pray Lord sometimes I preached ain't got no voice left how many times have you bumped into that will of God and you keep bumping into in the will of God does not you may not understand this statement now but you will one day I'm so glad he don't move I'm so glad he don't move I'm glad II don't give him when I want him to give him every time I'm ready just don't get my why every time I ask I'm glad three years ago I quit preaching I left and I quit so I ain't
