[0:00] look friend there's wonderful things
[0:02] that's happening among us
[0:03] but there's all kinds of bad things
[0:05] happening among us as well
[0:06] how do you figure anybody in our church
[0:08] that's going to be healed
[0:10] if we all stay perfectly healthy
[0:13] how do you figure we're going to see any
[0:15] miracles
[0:17] the lord gave me a sermon title whenever
[0:19] i was during this time of covet
[0:20] woke me up about 3 000 3 in the morning
[0:23] something like that 3 30.
[0:24] and i heard him say these words very
[0:26] peculiar and was not speaking to me
[0:29] personally now but it was a sermon title
[0:31] can i borrow your body
[0:35] for a miracle
[0:39] he did yours and i laid their brother
[0:44] down and i thought my goodness
[0:47] can i borrow your body and i laid there
[0:50] and prayed and thought it through
[0:52] i wanted to make sure he wasn't talking
[0:54] to me personally the lord says mean i'm
[0:59] getting worse
[1:01] you know and then i realized as the
[1:03] inspiration to begin to break on he was
[1:05] not
[1:06] not speaking to me personally but he was
[1:08] speaking to me a sermon title
[1:10] and i thought what a phenomenal thing
[1:14] that if god were to ask you
[1:18] can i borrow your body and i thought
[1:20] about the man there
[1:22] whenever the disciples said lord who
[1:24] sinned this man
[1:27] or his parents that he was born blind
[1:30] jesus said neither one but that the
[1:32] glory of god
[1:34] what did he want to do he wanted to
[1:37] borrow his body
[1:38] to display a miracle oh hallelujah or
[1:42] children if we could only look at it
[1:44] that way when sickness comes our way
[1:47] when trouble comes over and say lord you
[1:49] want to borrow my body for a divine
[1:51] healing
[1:52] you want to borrow my body oh god so i
[1:55] can stand up and give testimony
[1:58] the doctor said this wouldn't happen and
[2:00] that wouldn't happen
[2:01] but god borrowed my body and let
[2:04] omnipotence manifest itself through me
[2:07] and what god oh hallelujah what god
[2:10] himself said i will do the doctor said
[2:13] it's impossible
[2:14] faith does not make things easy
[2:17] faith makes them possible
[2:20] let me say it again faith does not make
[2:23] things easy faith makes things
[2:26] possible
[2:30] [Applause]
[2:32] hallelujah hallelujah can you imagine in
[2:36] a sense the lord jesus could have said
[2:39] of the two in the field of the two women
[2:42] grinding
[2:43] he could have said to the one can i
[2:46] borrow your body
[2:48] for a miracle
[2:53] i believe there's people sitting right
[2:54] here in this place tonight
[2:56] that will have that very thing to happen
[2:58] to you
[3:01] the lord jesus will borrow your body
[3:05] for a miracle but it won't be a divine
[3:08] healing
[3:09] it will be a change forever
