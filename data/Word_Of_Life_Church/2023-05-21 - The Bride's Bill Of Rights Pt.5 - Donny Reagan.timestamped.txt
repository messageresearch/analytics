[30:56] know that he makes absolutely no
[30:59] mistakes

[31:27] love him so much and we're trusting him
[31:30] and we're longing for the day when we're
[31:32] going to be changed and I want him to be
[31:35] a part of this service not only just
[31:36] giving
[31:37] but being able to receive yeah
[31:40] God bless you
[31:43] if I get this crazy I appeared to work
[31:46] boy it's going to be one of them kind of
[31:48] services I can see already
[31:53] look out devil
[31:56] God bless you
[31:58] and we are here
[32:00] it was working perfectly fine before I
[32:02] came out
[32:05] yeah it's okay
[32:08] Matthew chapter 7. verse 7 and 8.
[32:13] hmm
[32:15] get me that other one
[32:20] I reckon I'm going to start carrying
[32:21] three of them
[32:24] yeah whatever that's right we do
[32:26] whatever we need to do don't we
[32:29] Matthew chapter 7.
[32:36] verse 7.
[32:39] all right
[32:46] this is the words of the Lord Jesus now
[32:48] thank you
[32:51] ask
[32:54] and it shall be given
[32:56] unto you
[32:58] so I asked for another app iPad and I
[33:01] got one
[33:05] ask and it shall be given you
[33:08] seek
[33:10] and ye shall find
[33:14] knock
[33:20] and it shall be opened unto you
[33:23] for everyone that asks us
[33:27] not everyone that asks one time and that
[33:31] was it
[33:32] but ask us
[33:33] you're just continuing to ask
[33:37] for everyone that asks us
[33:39] receiveth
[33:41] he that seeketh not salt one time in
[33:45] past tense but he that seeketh
[33:48] findeth
[33:50] and to him that
[33:53] Marcus
[33:55] which is continually
[33:58] Lord I need this amen
[34:01] sometimes you ought to keep right on
[34:03] knocking
[34:05] sometimes you might have to knock a few
[34:07] Devils on the head while you're knocking
[34:08] but you just keep on knocking right
[34:10] because we're persistent
[34:12] he that notice to him that
[34:16] asketh everyone that asketh receiveth he
[34:18] that seeketh findeth to him that knock
[34:22] us it shall be opened I love the way
[34:27] that Jesus said this and remember this
[34:29] was an Aramaic whenever he said it and
[34:32] the words was that to him that is
[34:35] constant at the throne of grace
[34:39] who continues knocking
[34:41] at the door of Mercy
[34:44] will have no denial
[34:46] will have no denial
[34:49] but it shall be opened to him
[34:52] and you'll have entrance into the
[34:54] holiest of holies
[34:56] know this again in Matthew chapter 17
[34:58] verse 20.
[35:01] and remember these aren't my words now
[35:03] these aren't the words of some man but
[35:06] exit the words of the Lord Jesus himself
[35:10] to his people
[35:12] Jesus said unto them we read this
[35:14] Wednesday night because of your unbelief
[35:17] will really I say unto you remember they
[35:19] couldn't cast out the devil and that
[35:21] asked the Lord Jesus why so he answers
[35:23] them because of your unbelief for verily
[35:26] I say unto you if you have faith as of a
[35:30] grain of mustard seed you shall say unto
[35:33] this mountain remove hints to Yonder
[35:37] place and it shall remove
[35:40] and nothing
[35:42] shall be impossible
[35:45] unto you
[35:47] I guess the question is this
[35:49] do we actually believe this is true
[35:53] you actually believe it's the truth or
[35:56] would we say well I've tried that and it
[35:57] didn't work well I know another person
[35:59] who tried it and didn't work that has
[36:01] nothing to do with his word his word is
[36:04] always right
[36:08] John
[36:10] chapter 16 verse 24.
[36:17] hitherto
[36:19] have you asked nothing
[36:21] in my name
[36:23] ask
[36:25] and you shall receive
[36:28] that your joy
[36:30] may be full
[36:32] how many knows what that's like to
[36:33] experience it whenever God answers a
[36:35] prayer and it just it just does
[36:38] something to you
[36:40] I mean a lot to be remembered today as
[36:41] we pray and approach the word
[36:44] Heavenly Father we love you so much
[36:46] we're so grateful Lord for the
[36:47] opportunity that we can be gathered
[36:49] together today Lord Jesus we thank you
[36:52] your God we bring before you our needs
[36:55] our desires our petitions but that's
[36:58] only part of the reason that we're here
[37:00] today we're here to minister to you
[37:03] because you are our husband Our Redeemer
[37:07] Our Savior you have done so much for us
[37:10] if you never answered one more prayer we
[37:14] have enough to thank you for for
[37:16] eternity but we believe you're going to
[37:18] keep right on answering and get right on
[37:21] moving because as we go on our needs
[37:24] seem like they become greater and
[37:25] greater and the things we Face become
[37:28] greater but we believe your power is
[37:30] greater than anything we'll ever face
[37:32] speak to us today help me Lord to be
[37:35] able to get out of the way I need you so
[37:37] much help me Lord Jesus I pray
[37:40] it's in the name of the word we ask it
[37:43] amen God bless you you may be seated
[37:49] again I'd like to speak to you today on
[37:51] the brides
[37:53] Bill of Rights
[37:57] as I look around this
[38:00] darkened world
[38:02] that we're in every day
[38:05] you see pain stress anxiety sin sickness
[38:09] evil rottenness of the world corruption
[38:14] you see people that are so Bound by
[38:16] things of the world and they live their
[38:20] life from day to day and just simply try
[38:23] to exist until they get to a spot to
[38:25] where they think
[38:27] it just ain't worth living anymore
[38:29] and they take their life
[38:31] or they go out and take the lives of
[38:34] others and then have their lives taken
[38:37] by police officers
[38:39] which is such a sad thing
[38:41] to end your life in such a way and go
[38:45] out of this world into the presence of
[38:47] God lost
[38:49] and yet on the other hand I look at
[38:52] people that are Christians people that
[38:55] love God people that serve him go to
[38:58] church live right do things that are
[39:01] right pay their tithes have a faithful
[39:03] attendance to a church somewhere they
[39:05] love the Lord Jesus they clap they clap
[39:08] their hands and singing's going on they
[39:11] actually sing and then they just
[39:13] participate in worship
[39:16] and yet some of those are just as bound
[39:20] in their own way
[39:22] with either sins or shortcomings
[39:27] and when I look into the word is what
[39:30] the Lord has provided for us as his
[39:33] people I don't mind telling you it
[39:35] breaks my heart
[39:37] because if all he would have done would
[39:40] have purchased salvation for us and said
[39:43] now from this point on I won't heal you
[39:45] I won't deliver you I won't give you
[39:47] anything else but I just give you a
[39:50] one-way ticket and then don't ask me for
[39:52] anything else that would in itself would
[39:54] be enough to be thankful for would it
[39:56] not
[39:57] but when we look at the full coverage of
[40:01] benefits that he said in his word of
[40:04] what he wants us to have and then we see
[40:08] so many people that fall so short of
[40:12] what God wants them to have I wonder how
[40:15] it makes him feel as I look at it as
[40:17] just a mere mortal man like the rest of
[40:20] you humans are and if it breaks my heart
[40:24] seeing people fall short of what God
[40:27] intended for them to have I wonder how
[40:30] much more it makes him as if though he
[40:34] only made a way for us to be saved and
[40:38] basically live the rest of our life with
[40:40] some Sadness and Sorrow and such heavy
[40:44] burdens as if though he paid no price
[40:47] for that we act sometimes as if though
[40:51] Our God has no promise of Joy he has no
[40:56] promise of overcoming and of Deliverance
[41:00] and yet it is one of our our rights as
[41:04] the people of God to be able to to
[41:07] overcome I may believe that so the Lord
[41:10] doesn't just want us to survive I don't
[41:13] want to be a Survivor no I I just I just
[41:17] don't want to be a Survivor I want to be
[41:20] an overcomer I want to be a conqueror
[41:24] praise the Lord
[41:26] not only do I want to be I am
[41:29] now I hope there's more of you and I
[41:31] believe there are setting here with me
[41:32] today and you could raise your hand and
[41:35] say I am too by God's grace but yet
[41:38] there may be people here this morning
[41:40] and maybe some of you that are
[41:43] overcoming in certain capacities of your
[41:47] life and yet you're defeated in other
[41:51] capacities of your life to me to be a
[41:55] Christian and to live a defeated life
[41:59] it's so sad
[42:01] I deal with some all the time and my
[42:04] Journeys around this world praying for
[42:07] people even counseling with pastors and
[42:12] with preachers and ministers and hearing
[42:15] the things that preachers themselves
[42:17] will deal with and hearing that
[42:20] preachers sometimes themselves live less
[42:24] than a Victorious Life
[42:26] it's a sad scenario
[42:29] especially when we think that our God
[42:32] purchased the full benefit look friend
[42:35] we don't just have liability we've got
[42:38] full coverage
[42:39] he didn't just say okay you're saved and
[42:42] then that's the end of it we've got full
[42:44] coverage as a matter of fact David said
[42:47] he Lotus me daily with his benefits I
[42:52] think that uncovered everything that we
[42:54] will ever need from the day we get saved
[42:56] to the day we leave this world
[42:59] but yet how is it then that so many are
[43:03] able to be a Christian and have a walk
[43:06] with the Lord today brother Donnie yes
[43:09] they have a walk with the Lord and they
[43:11] love the Lord and he loves them and yet
[43:13] they're living here when he wants them
[43:16] to be up here and I forget living where
[43:18] maybe some great man of God some Prophet
[43:21] like our prophet of the age none of us
[43:23] will never live they will never have the
[43:25] Walkers God he had were not ordained to
[43:27] I don't want that myself I want what God
[43:30] ordained for me to have that's my
[43:33] personal possession maybe some of you
[43:36] will have something with God I could
[43:38] only dream about well I'm not going to
[43:40] be jealous because you do I just want to
[43:43] have what's got my name on it that's
[43:45] what I want for me and if it is mine I
[43:48] don't understand why that I shouldn't
[43:50] have it what about you and I believe
[43:52] according to the word that overcoming is
[43:55] one of those rights that God has given
[43:58] to us and yet it is something we will
[44:00] have to fight for every day of our life
[44:02] now when I mention overcome maybe in
[44:05] your mind you'll go here there and there
[44:07] you'll think of certain people well I
[44:09] know brother so-and-so you know he's
[44:11] dating with maybe smoking or so-and-so's
[44:13] dealing with uh they have a problem with
[44:15] drinking or they're having a problem
[44:17] with this or that or the other it's not
[44:19] just always that some of the greatest
[44:21] things that I've found that people can
[44:23] deal with and they need to overcome it's
[44:26] things that are hidden so deep within
[44:28] themselves hardly nobody else even knows
[44:31] they fight it but yet they find it
[44:33] nonetheless it can be interferes that
[44:36] are so interwoven in their spirit in
[44:39] things that happen to them whenever they
[44:41] were children it can be trauma that was
[44:43] induced to them by someone else and they
[44:46] didn't even do anything themselves to
[44:48] cause it and can be so heavy inside out
[44:52] of them and they're afraid to let anyone
[44:54] even know anything about it and yet they
[44:57] deal with it day by day or week by week
[45:00] you know I don't believe the Lord Jesus
[45:02] wants us to deal with such nonsense I
[45:05] believe he's sure today to set us free
[45:07] from such if we will allow it now
[45:11] overcoming is a great thing it can be a
[45:14] temper it can be anger it can be
[45:17] resentment either toward someone you
[45:20] love someone you go to church with or
[45:22] what's even worse resentment toward God
[45:25] you see many people and God will take a
[45:28] loved one or God won't hear a prayer the
[45:31] way they prayed him and the way they
[45:33] thought God should answer they will
[45:34] start with a little bit of an attitude
[45:36] and it will build and build over time
[45:39] until it becomes such a resentment
[45:41] toward God that quit praying they quit
[45:44] talking to him they quit going to his
[45:46] house and the next thing you know
[45:48] they've got a real issue and if they let
[45:50] it go far enough they'll eventually
[45:52] backslide and turn so against God they
[45:56] will hate him with such a degree the
[45:59] same degree that they loved him before
[46:01] because they never overcome that
[46:05] resentment and it's not just that it can
[46:07] be toward God but it can be toward
[46:10] people I dare say there's not a person
[46:12] here today that has not been hurt let
[46:15] down used abused betrayed whatever words
[46:19] we want to use to describe that we have
[46:22] all been affected by other people how
[46:25] many have we we've been let down we've
[46:27] been disappointed sometimes it can be
[46:30] family members it can be close friends
[46:32] it can be a preacher it can be whoever a
[46:35] deacon a trustee whoever that we have
[46:37] respect for and Satan will try his best
[46:40] to turn that inward on you you see Paul
[46:43] use the word when he defined it well
[46:46] about bitterness and Paul described this
[46:49] bitterness not as a tree not as a plant
[46:53] but he described it as a root so the
[46:57] Bible then identifies this as a root of
[47:01] bitterness and where does the root grow
[47:03] a root grows deep within the Earth it
[47:07] can be there for years and years nobody
[47:10] ever even know it's there but the person
[47:12] who has it and then all of a sudden
[47:15] it'll begin to shoot up out of the
[47:17] ground though it's been in their heart
[47:19] for a long long time bitterness against
[47:22] a husband bitterness against a wife and
[47:25] truly when we are hurt deep it takes the
[47:28] spirit of God to help us but let me just
[47:30] give you a warning if you do not let the
[47:33] spirit of God help you deal with
[47:36] bitterness and be able to get an
[47:38] attitude out of your heart it will zap
[47:41] your Victory before God but brother
[47:44] Donnie you don't know how deep I
[47:47] probably don't and you don't know how
[47:49] deep I've been hurt either if I could
[47:52] lay my heart before you here today it's
[47:55] not like you'd see great volumes of love
[47:57] and great volumes of the miraculous
[48:00] probably what you'd see more than
[48:02] anything would be the scars the pain all
[48:06] that I've been through as a Christian
[48:08] and I don't stand you're alone if I
[48:10] could see your heart I probably wouldn't
[48:13] say great renowning miraculous things I
[48:17] will no doubt see disappointments and
[48:20] hurts maybe in a wife maybe in a husband
[48:23] one that you trusted so much
[48:26] and yet you were so let down but it's up
[48:30] to you and I with what we do with that
[48:33] resentment we can let it control us or
[48:36] we can be honest with God and say God
[48:39] this thing is bigger than me and if you
[48:43] don't help me I can see already it's
[48:45] going to destroy me but I do not want to
[48:49] destroyed destroyed by this devil I want
[48:52] it under my feet is anybody listening to
[48:55] me this morning now you may sit there
[48:58] today and you might smell a brother and
[49:00] you get around him and you know he's got
[49:02] a problem with smoking that don't take
[49:04] much discernment does it it don't take
[49:07] much discernment if you see a little
[49:08] color between his fingers or a little
[49:11] Amber or still running out of his mouth
[49:13] or his Aqua Velva did not quite hide the
[49:16] cigarette smoke you know that person
[49:19] it's easy to see they have a problem
[49:21] maybe someone who gets real wrong and
[49:24] they lose their temper and they I say
[49:26] things they shouldn't say it's really
[49:28] easy for us to see that individual but
[49:31] sometimes it's the one that Harbors that
[49:34] root of bitterness that is so deep and
[49:37] resentment that is so deep no one knows
[49:40] it at the church nobody even knows it
[49:43] but their family does the wife does the
[49:45] husband does their closest intimate
[49:48] friends and yet when they are by
[49:50] themselves or with someone they think
[49:52] they can trust they get so angry and
[49:56] they will pound and they will Express
[49:59] such resentment yet if I would walk up
[50:02] they would squelch that resentment and
[50:05] bury it again deep Beneath The Human
[50:09] Side
[50:11] but you can only hide that for so long
[50:13] and to me many times those people are in
[50:17] worse shape than the man who's smoking
[50:20] cause he knows pretty much everybody
[50:22] knows but he keeps coming to church and
[50:25] if you're here today and you have a
[50:27] problem of smoking hey keep on coming
[50:30] back right here's where you can get
[50:32] Deliverance of that Oh you mean you want
[50:35] me to come absolutely I want you to come
[50:37] I figure your chances of getting
[50:40] delivered are way better of here than
[50:42] you are sitting at the house I figure
[50:45] whatever you're dealing with today your
[50:47] chances of getting touched by the
[50:49] presence of God and delivered a much
[50:52] greater being setting here that you are
[50:54] well I ain't going to go till I get
[50:56] everything took care of and let me know
[50:58] how that works for you I don't mind
[51:01] telling you I want this place to be like
[51:03] an ER I want this church to be like a
[51:06] hospital we want the lame the blind the
[51:09] halt the the smoking the
[51:11] marijuana the addicts whatever they are
[51:14] we want them to be able to come here and
[51:17] get set free this is not a place for
[51:20] only The Godly and only the holy well
[51:24] when you get good enough you can come to
[51:26] our church no when yours low down this
[51:29] rotten scumbag of the earth that's the
[51:32] kind we want to specialized in writing
[51:36] you to the Lord Jesus and being able to
[51:38] cast that spirit away from you and watch
[51:42] him take drugs out of your life and
[51:45] alcohol out of your life and bitterness
[51:48] out of your life and resentment out of
[51:51] your life and fill you with the baptism
[51:54] of the Holy Ghost
[52:02] you say our master
[52:05] place it in the bride's Bill of Rights
[52:09] the right
[52:11] to overcome
[52:13] he said these words in Saint John 16 33.
[52:18] these things have I spoken unto you that
[52:21] in me you might have peace
[52:24] in the world you shall have tribulation
[52:27] and everybody said
[52:30] amen
[52:32] but be
[52:34] of good cheer
[52:37] I have overcome the world
[52:40] now what I find amazing about this is he
[52:43] hasn't even died
[52:45] he has not went to the cross
[52:48] he has not been whipped
[52:50] he's not went to Hades and took the keys
[52:54] away from the Devil
[52:56] but he says I have already overcome
[53:01] now do you understand who's saying this
[53:04] it's not just the sonship of God
[53:08] but it's God himself
[53:11] the sonship the humanity is dreading the
[53:15] cross
[53:16] it is dreading the Bible tells us in the
[53:18] book of Hebrews it was heard in that he
[53:21] feared
[53:23] now I want you to catch this as he says
[53:26] it be of good cheer I have overcome now
[53:30] I'm not going to but I have overcome
[53:34] the world so not only did he go before
[53:39] us
[53:40] but he did it for us
[53:42] not only before us but for us so when
[53:48] we're looking at something that seems
[53:50] like it's absolutely unsurmountable it
[53:53] is so great how can I ever survive this
[53:56] one I've been through a lot of things
[53:58] you might say but how in the world will
[54:01] I ever survive this one my word to you
[54:03] today is be of good cheer he has
[54:06] overcome the world
[54:08] now notice this he tells us this and
[54:12] John remember the same man who wrote
[54:14] this in chapter 16 verse 33 also wrote
[54:18] to us again in first John chapter 5
[54:21] verse 4 and 5 and told us that we also
[54:25] would be Overcomers notice he says I
[54:30] have overcome the world so the Serene
[54:34] confidence and assurance that our lord
[54:37] Jesus has in what he's fixing to face
[54:42] calmly calmly with Serenity and
[54:46] Assurance as God as God I'll tell you we
[54:51] fight too many of our battles as a human
[54:54] when most of the time we need to fight
[54:57] them as deity
[55:00] we will get defeated by fighting our
[55:03] battles as human beings because Satan
[55:06] will scare us to death by using our
[55:09] reasoning he will use this person's word
[55:11] in that person's word and a doctor's
[55:14] report and whatever more and the News
[55:16] you listen to every day there ain't
[55:19] hardly nothing anymore on the news it's
[55:21] even encouraging are they you can't
[55:23] hardly go to anywhere any news station
[55:26] or whatever app you have on your phone
[55:28] it's all bad it's all discouraging it's
[55:32] all disheartening but let me tell you
[55:34] there is the greatest news that's ever
[55:36] been in the earth and that is the Gospel
[55:39] of Jesus Christ because the word gospel
[55:43] means the good news
[55:45] amen notice so he's looking at deaths in
[55:50] the face he's looking at suffering like
[55:54] no human being has ever suffered he's
[55:57] looking at the spirit of God the Father
[55:59] to leave him in the Garden of Gethsemane
[56:02] he's looking to be turned into a goat
[56:07] not a sheep
[56:09] a goat
[56:11] he's looking to be cursed
[56:15] in the eyes of God
[56:18] he's looking to be rejected by God
[56:23] and yet he says
[56:25] be of good cheer
[56:27] I've overcome the world
[56:29] only God
[56:32] could behave
[56:33] such Behavior no other way immortal
[56:37] could face such things and still say be
[56:41] of good cheer I hope somebody's going to
[56:43] hear me this morning
[56:45] this is the way I think we should fight
[56:48] our battles that we don't just fight
[56:50] them as mere mortals but we look at them
[56:53] as who we are Sons and Daughters of God
[56:57] and say it's bigger than me it's bigger
[57:00] than my family it's bigger than her
[57:02] church it's bigger than all of all of us
[57:05] put together but it ain't bigger than
[57:07] our God for greater is he that is in you
[57:10] than he that is in the world be all good
[57:14] cheer I have overcome the world
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:20] notice in Romans chapter 12 verse 21
[57:23] that Paul says be not overcome of evil
[57:27] but overcome evil with good be not
[57:31] overcome of evil but overcome evil with
[57:36] good you see the Lord is not telling us
[57:39] to turn the other Chief and pray for
[57:41] them that despitefully use and all those
[57:43] blessed scriptures just in order to make
[57:46] us look like something that we're not
[57:48] but here is the key to overcoming evil
[57:52] you actually overcome it with good so if
[57:56] someone says something bad about you you
[57:58] don't overcome it by saying three times
[58:01] as much bad about them as a matter of
[58:04] fact the evil just took your Victory how
[58:08] do we overcome evil we actually overcome
[58:11] evil with good first John 2 13 I rather
[58:15] unto you fathers because you have known
[58:18] him that is from the beginning I I love
[58:20] the way John categorically brings it
[58:23] breaks this up in speaking to them I
[58:26] know a lot of people say well we
[58:27] shouldn't have youth services and we
[58:29] shouldn't just specify certain things to
[58:32] the youth you need to re-read your Bible
[58:34] because as a matter of fact they did
[58:37] just that notice I write unto you young
[58:40] men now why not just say it to everybody
[58:43] in general why would John specifically
[58:46] say I write unto you fathers which no
[58:49] doubt would have been older men because
[58:51] you have known him that is from the
[58:53] beginning I write unto you young men
[58:56] because you have ye have overcome the
[59:01] wicked one now here John wanted this to
[59:03] be noted in the New Testament so that it
[59:07] would be an encouragement not only to
[59:09] the young men of that day but to the
[59:11] young men in the days of the church ages
[59:14] and I trust here today that some of our
[59:17] young Brothers can say if God helped
[59:19] them people and they were having their
[59:21] heads cut off they were having their
[59:24] bodies burned at Stakes they were being
[59:26] reviled and persecuted fed to the Lions
[59:29] brought before the Roman citizens and
[59:32] the Colosseum and I stood there many
[59:34] years ago went to the catacombs in Rome
[59:37] and see where the saints of God gathered
[59:40] together for church and think John was
[59:43] writing this around 93 94 A.D so during
[59:47] this time was when the persecution was
[59:49] going on and John wasn't just writing to
[59:52] old people because that Apostolic he
[59:55] feeds in church didn't have people 75
[59:58] and above it had young men filled with
[1:00:01] the Holy Ghost it had young sisters
[1:00:03] filled with the Holy Ghost and John
[1:00:06] wants to acknowledge them notice he said
[1:00:09] I write unto you little children because
[1:00:12] ye have known the father I have written
[1:00:15] unto you fathers because you have known
[1:00:17] him that is from the beginning I have
[1:00:20] written unto you young men because ye
[1:00:24] are strong that's the kind of young man
[1:00:26] we want in our church is it not
[1:00:29] I have written unto you young men
[1:00:31] because ye are strong and the word of
[1:00:35] God abideth in you and ye have overcome
[1:00:40] the wicked one may I say to our young
[1:00:43] Brothers here today whether you are
[1:00:46] single or maybe you're a young man that
[1:00:48] is married you can take hope looking at
[1:00:51] your brothers which have lived before
[1:00:53] you but Brother Don who they didn't face
[1:00:55] what I did that's exactly right and you
[1:00:57] don't face what they did either we were
[1:01:00] able to come here today drive up in our
[1:01:02] vehicle and come to have church if you
[1:01:05] want to come back later and fellowship
[1:01:07] in the fellowship hall you can do so if
[1:01:09] we want to come tomorrow and the next
[1:01:11] day and the next day so far we still
[1:01:14] have our rights to be able to do it but
[1:01:16] can you imagine them every time they
[1:01:18] gather together under the emperor oh my
[1:01:21] that they would put out and edict
[1:01:23] anybody gathering in the name of Jesus
[1:01:26] they can be arrested and there was young
[1:01:28] men who risked their lives to go to the
[1:01:32] catacombs and say the devil will not
[1:01:34] keep me out of church I wonder if the
[1:01:37] state of Tennessee would pass such a law
[1:01:40] it is against the law to go to church to
[1:01:43] Word of Life Church I wonder how many of
[1:01:46] you sitting here today would be here
[1:01:48] well I'll raise my hand as the first one
[1:01:51] I will I will I will anybody else be
[1:01:56] with me why because we are of the same
[1:02:00] caliber of people amen they could not
[1:02:04] shut them up in the first stage they
[1:02:06] cannot shut them up in our age because
[1:02:10] we are the same caliber we are
[1:02:13] Overcomers
[1:02:16] oh my
[1:02:19] notice John goes on to say in verse
[1:02:22] chapter 4 verse 4 ye are of God little
[1:02:26] children and have overcome them because
[1:02:29] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:02:33] that is in the world when I also face
[1:02:36] facts there will be things that we will
[1:02:38] face and it will be even greater than
[1:02:41] what our human ability you may be a
[1:02:43] scholar of the message you might be a
[1:02:46] theologian of the message and when a
[1:02:48] preacher goes to start quoting a quote
[1:02:50] you can finish it for him and you might
[1:02:52] quote it more accurate than he does for
[1:02:54] God but yet at the same time you will
[1:02:57] not overcome just by your knowledge of
[1:03:00] quoting scripture John never said your
[1:03:03] Overcomers because you memorize what I
[1:03:05] wrote and you memorize what Matthew
[1:03:08] wrote but he said you are an overcomer
[1:03:11] because greater is he that is in you
[1:03:15] than he that is in the world we want our
[1:03:18] church to study the word read the word
[1:03:20] write listen to tapes hear the preaching
[1:03:23] of the word but the main aspect I want
[1:03:25] you to have today is to get the
[1:03:28] Overcomer inside of you and when the
[1:03:31] Overcomer lives inside of you he will
[1:03:34] feed on the word he will Empower you he
[1:03:38] will overcome using your own body
[1:03:41] because the Lord Jesus is an overcomer
[1:03:44] whether he's in his body or your body or
[1:03:48] your body or my body he is an overcomer
[1:03:53] I love this in first John 5 4 for
[1:03:57] whatsoever is born of God
[1:04:00] overcometh the world I want you to
[1:04:03] notice he doesn't say maybe I'm praying
[1:04:05] they will perhaps they will
[1:04:08] but they do who whatsoever is born of
[1:04:11] God overcometh the world look at this
[1:04:14] word nikhail which means conquer Prevail
[1:04:16] get the victory to carry off the victory
[1:04:21] oh I love them days don't you I love it
[1:04:24] when you grab a hold of that victim you
[1:04:26] just carry it off notice this and this
[1:04:29] is the victory that overcometh the world
[1:04:32] even our shouting
[1:04:36] even our emotion our dancing our feeling
[1:04:41] what victory is it that overcomes the
[1:04:43] world
[1:04:44] what
[1:04:45] faith so when you feel him or whether
[1:04:48] you don't Faith still says I'm a winner
[1:04:51] either way
[1:04:53] now notice who is he that overcometh the
[1:04:56] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[1:04:58] is not was is the Son of God notice
[1:05:03] again in Revelation chapter 2 verse 7
[1:05:05] coming down to the church ages and God
[1:05:08] offered each age a reward now we're very
[1:05:11] fortunate in one aspect you may not
[1:05:13] consider yourself fortunate to be living
[1:05:15] in this last day but you are because in
[1:05:17] every age God gave them a reward now the
[1:05:20] last stage gets the accumulation of all
[1:05:23] seven the first age will get a great
[1:05:25] reward the second and third and fourths
[1:05:27] on them and now we're living in the last
[1:05:30] stage and it will be the accumulation of
[1:05:32] all the rewards of the church ages
[1:05:34] handed to the Believers in this day now
[1:05:37] you say oh that's wonderful well what
[1:05:38] that means is you're fighting seven
[1:05:40] times more than what they fought in
[1:05:41] other ages but we're more than able to
[1:05:44] do it notice he that has an ear
[1:05:46] Revelation 2 7 let him hear what the
[1:05:49] spirit saith unto the churches to him
[1:05:52] that overcome Thomas well I give to eat
[1:05:55] of the tree of life which is in the
[1:05:58] midst of the paradise of God now this
[1:06:01] was the reward promised to the Ephesian
[1:06:03] age this is also my reward this is your
[1:06:07] reward now what you notice as it changes
[1:06:10] them from there and we come to the
[1:06:12] second Church age to have a different
[1:06:14] reward so the Ephesian age was not
[1:06:16] promised the reward of the second Church
[1:06:19] age notice how divided that it was verse
[1:06:21] 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:06:24] the spirit says and the church is he
[1:06:26] that overcome us shall not be hurt of
[1:06:29] the second death notice how important
[1:06:31] overcoming is to God you see there will
[1:06:34] be no one that will go in the Rapture
[1:06:37] unless they are living an overcoming
[1:06:40] life friends this is not an option like
[1:06:43] power lend us on your car this is not an
[1:06:46] option well do you want an MP3 player or
[1:06:48] do you not want to do you want this and
[1:06:50] don't want that no this is absolutely a
[1:06:53] requirement the Overcomers are the ones
[1:06:56] that will be crowned and set with the
[1:06:59] Lord Jesus in order to be bride we have
[1:07:03] to be Overcomers well what have I got to
[1:07:05] overcome the greatest thing you will
[1:07:07] ever overcome is yourself
[1:07:10] because no brother Donnie it is smoking
[1:07:12] noise it's this another no it's not
[1:07:15] smoking no smoking is not a sin smoking
[1:07:19] marijuana is not a sin drinking is not a
[1:07:22] sin there's only one sin and that's
[1:07:24] unbelief and the reason people do the
[1:07:27] above is because they don't believe what
[1:07:29] the word says about it so where does it
[1:07:31] all come look they could you could live
[1:07:33] around cigarette factors you could live
[1:07:36] next door to those taverns every way you
[1:07:39] would turn but if you've got the
[1:07:40] Overcomer inside of you you can walk
[1:07:42] right by him and say you curse it think
[1:07:44] it behind me in the name of Jesus you
[1:07:46] can walk by him or brought the Lambert
[1:07:48] whether east west north and south but if
[1:07:51] you've got the overcoming on the inside
[1:07:53] there ain't nothing that's going to stop
[1:07:55] you but if you ain't got an overcomer
[1:07:57] you might live right down Paradise
[1:08:00] Avenue where Paradise Avenue intersects
[1:08:02] hope Pope Avenue and you're living right
[1:08:05] next door to Peace Valley but if you
[1:08:07] ain't got the comforter on the inside of
[1:08:09] you you won't be able able to overcome I
[1:08:11] know I shouldn't do this I should not do
[1:08:14] this friends it's going to take more
[1:08:16] than US sighting up her mental attitude
[1:08:19] I don't need to do this I don't need to
[1:08:21] do this it's going to take a power
[1:08:23] inside the bride in this last day to be
[1:08:26] able to not only look sickness in the
[1:08:28] face but look death itself in the face
[1:08:31] and say death give way give way death
[1:08:35] you cannot stop us as the people of God
[1:08:38] we are more than conquerors
[1:08:43] yeah
[1:08:44] I know you know this and believe it but
[1:08:47] I believe with all of my heart there's
[1:08:48] people sitting right here today that
[1:08:50] will not die
[1:08:56] you see we're not just going to look
[1:08:57] hepatitis in the face cancer in the face
[1:09:00] or some other sickness but one day you
[1:09:03] will look death itself right in the face
[1:09:05] and say I thought you had me didn't you
[1:09:09] Now You See Me Now you don't
[1:09:12] let gas itself
[1:09:15] right in the
[1:09:17] face hey you can't have me I'm gone I'm
[1:09:20] out of here what is a headache compared
[1:09:23] to that what is cancer compared to that
[1:09:26] what is high blood pressure low blood
[1:09:29] pressure oh my goodness Lazarus had no
[1:09:32] blood pressure so if God can take care
[1:09:35] of the no blood pressure attitude I
[1:09:38] figure he can take care of a low blood
[1:09:40] pressure attitude he can take care of
[1:09:43] high blood low blood no blood because he
[1:09:46] is the great creator
[1:09:53] look again in verse 17 he that half a
[1:09:56] deer let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:09:57] unto the churches to him that overcometh
[1:10:00] well I give to either the hidden Manner
[1:10:03] and give him a white stone and in the
[1:10:06] stone a new name written which no man
[1:10:09] know us notice us now Noah saving he
[1:10:12] that receive it the accumulation of each
[1:10:15] Church age now as we come down notice
[1:10:17] he's not saying to him that shouts to
[1:10:20] him that runs to him who screams the
[1:10:23] loudest to him who hollers not even to
[1:10:26] him that works miracles not even to him
[1:10:29] that lays hands on the set notice one
[1:10:32] word one word that God uses the same in
[1:10:36] every Church age and basis the reward of
[1:10:40] every Church age on one word one only
[1:10:45] overcome
[1:10:48] overcome
[1:10:50] how many wants to be an overcomer
[1:10:54] listen how important not to him that
[1:10:56] raises the dead not to him that works
[1:10:59] miracles and Jesus said they'll stand
[1:11:01] before me that day and say I cast out
[1:11:03] devils in your name he'll say oh I'll
[1:11:05] say to them depart from me I never even
[1:11:06] knew you
[1:11:07] that ain't it friends we believe in that
[1:11:10] we believe God shouts we believe God
[1:11:12] anoints people to worship and run and
[1:11:14] praise God but you and I know my
[1:11:16] goodness I pray for enough of them and
[1:11:18] prayer lines all over the world so no
[1:11:20] they come through and you pray for them
[1:11:21] and they shout and run jump and fall out
[1:11:23] and three or four weeks are right back
[1:11:24] in somebody else's prayer line praying
[1:11:26] for the same thing that I prayed for
[1:11:27] them for before why we need more than
[1:11:30] prayer lines we need more than just
[1:11:32] getting our emotions all worked up and
[1:11:35] then coming right back what we want is
[1:11:37] people that can live Victorious
[1:11:39] overcoming lives and look the devil in
[1:11:42] the face and say I'm sick and tired of
[1:11:45] you stealing my victory I'm sick and
[1:11:47] tired of you stealing my joy you're
[1:11:50] stealing my peace with God give it back
[1:11:53] give it back in the name of Jesus
[1:12:03] verse 26 he that overcometh
[1:12:06] and keep us
[1:12:08] my works wow
[1:12:12] well what about his words
[1:12:14] sure you're going to keep his words
[1:12:16] wonder why I said works
[1:12:18] who keep us my works we don't want to be
[1:12:22] all mouths oh I believe this I believe I
[1:12:25] believe I believe I'll say I'll say I
[1:12:27] say works must accompany what we believe
[1:12:31] and everybody said
[1:12:34] he that keepeth my Works unto the end
[1:12:39] to him will I give power over the
[1:12:42] Nations
[1:12:43] again chapter 3 verse 5 he that
[1:12:45] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:12:48] white Raymond and I will not blott out
[1:12:49] his name out of the book of life you
[1:12:51] mean a person could have their name
[1:12:54] in The Book of Life
[1:12:57] and get it blotted out
[1:13:04] this is part of my reward
[1:13:07] he will not blot out my name
[1:13:15] oh praise God
[1:13:18] I don't want to just lay hands on the
[1:13:19] sick I've done that for decades I've
[1:13:22] seen Miracles my goodness believe me
[1:13:25] I've never shared with you one inkling
[1:13:27] of what I've seen God do
[1:13:29] but you know one reason I don't talk
[1:13:31] about it more because I know what stuff
[1:13:33] does like that to people they want to
[1:13:35] start following this
[1:13:38] they think they got to get to this man
[1:13:39] and that man and something I just read
[1:13:41] Carol a quote last time where brother
[1:13:43] Branham says it's not the certain man
[1:13:45] praying for you it's you within yourself
[1:13:47] having faith and believing God
[1:13:51] oh my
[1:13:54] notice this God's reward to the elect I
[1:13:58] will confess his name before my father
[1:14:01] and before his angels to who the shelter
[1:14:05] the jumper the preacher
[1:14:13] overcome do you understand there will be
[1:14:15] countless of preachers that'll have
[1:14:17] their name removed
[1:14:20] an angel will stand there and blot out
[1:14:23] their name now they're they're writing
[1:14:25] this as if they were doing that day they
[1:14:27] did not have paper and stuff of course
[1:14:29] the way we did so they would take part
[1:14:31] of the ink and blot out they would take
[1:14:33] a heavy dose of the ink and go over the
[1:14:37] riding there and blot out that oh what a
[1:14:40] terrible saying to stand there and your
[1:14:42] name
[1:14:46] it was sad when you walked up and now
[1:14:49] you're standing there and it's gone why
[1:14:51] it was blotted out
[1:14:55] oh Lord God
[1:14:57] but for those that overcome
[1:15:00] he said I will not blot out your name
[1:15:04] as a matter of fact I will confess your
[1:15:07] name can you imagine the Lord Jesus
[1:15:09] speaking your true word name
[1:15:13] before this eternal one on the throne
[1:15:16] and he will turn to the myriads maybe
[1:15:19] Millions times millions of angels and he
[1:15:22] will say to them look at my daughter so
[1:15:26] and so
[1:15:27] she was an overcomer
[1:15:29] here is my son whatever your true word
[1:15:32] name is I want you all to see my son
[1:15:38] glory to God
[1:15:40] glory to God
[1:15:43] Lord children if that's the only reward
[1:15:44] I got that'd be enough to fight every
[1:15:46] devil out of hell up with it can you
[1:15:48] imagine by the nation sat in there and
[1:15:50] the Lord Jesus confesses our name before
[1:15:52] the father and tense of those myriads of
[1:15:54] angels and said what to introduce to you
[1:15:57] my word son
[1:16:00] my word daughter
[1:16:03] how are they here master
[1:16:05] how did they get here they overcome
[1:16:11] they lived in that Wicked sinful Dark
[1:16:14] Age of laodiceem
[1:16:16] there was a rottenness and Corruption
[1:16:19] everywhere
[1:16:20] and that overcome and they stood for me
[1:16:22] now I'm standing for them and I want all
[1:16:25] of heaven to know
[1:16:27] silence
[1:16:30] photos silence
[1:16:33] what I speak
[1:16:35] their name
[1:16:38] in the Lord Jesus would speak your name
[1:16:43] my son
[1:16:45] so and so
[1:16:48] glory to God
[1:16:50] give me that brother
[1:16:55] notice in Revelation 3 12 him that
[1:16:58] overcometh so I may
[1:17:02] in the temple
[1:17:04] of my God
[1:17:07] a pillar
[1:17:09] yeah sort of like the two in Solomon's
[1:17:15] when Solomon erected his Great temple
[1:17:17] and God gave him the pattern to follow
[1:17:19] according to what David had saw and
[1:17:21] there's two big massive pillars as you
[1:17:24] come into the entrance
[1:17:27] the whole building held up on these
[1:17:31] pillars
[1:17:32] Jesus says to him that overcomes
[1:17:36] I will make you a pillar in the house of
[1:17:39] my God
[1:17:45] and he shall know more go no more out
[1:17:48] and I will ride upon him the name
[1:17:52] of my God
[1:17:53] in the name of the city of my God
[1:17:57] which is New Jerusalem which cometh down
[1:18:00] out of Heaven from my God
[1:18:02] and I will ride upon him
[1:18:06] my new name
[1:18:09] to what category of people one
[1:18:13] Overcomers
[1:18:15] I think by the Paul we take it too
[1:18:18] lightly
[1:18:21] to overcome France
[1:18:24] it well boy that's something it's not
[1:18:27] just something
[1:18:28] it's everything
[1:18:31] you see if we don't overcome all of our
[1:18:35] running all of our knowledge all of our
[1:18:37] shouting all of our preaching all of our
[1:18:40] signs what will that be worse
[1:18:44] if we don't
[1:18:46] overcome
[1:18:52] Revelation 3 21 now here's the promise
[1:18:55] the seventh promise but remember you get
[1:18:58] all consecutive of them put together one
[1:19:01] through seven
[1:19:02] to him that overcometh all I grant to
[1:19:05] set with me and my throne
[1:19:09] even as I also overcame
[1:19:12] and I'm sat down with my father
[1:19:15] and his son
[1:19:17] Revelation 21 7 he that overcometh shall
[1:19:22] inherit
[1:19:23] all things
[1:19:25] and I will be his God
[1:19:29] and he
[1:19:31] shall be my son
[1:19:36] what could be greater
[1:19:38] than that
[1:19:43] I love this
[1:19:45] in the church age book and I know you're
[1:19:47] familiar with it
[1:19:49] in the layout of sin
[1:19:51] Church age page 360. now what are we to
[1:19:55] overcome
[1:19:56] that is the normal question to ask here
[1:20:00] but that is not the actual thought of
[1:20:02] this verse for it is not so much what
[1:20:07] we are to overcome
[1:20:09] but how
[1:20:12] you see so much of the time we focus on
[1:20:15] what
[1:20:17] uh I've got a pornography problem I've
[1:20:19] got temper I've got resentment I've got
[1:20:22] your focusing on what
[1:20:25] not how
[1:20:27] if we can ever learn how
[1:20:30] it won't be no difference what the
[1:20:31] problem is you'll know how to handle it
[1:20:35] and some of you can overcome this and
[1:20:38] that in the other but you keep focusing
[1:20:40] on the what
[1:20:41] instead of letting the same principle of
[1:20:44] the house that lets you overcome all
[1:20:46] these other 57 things in your life
[1:20:49] you're letting and you're naming that
[1:20:51] can't you see the power of naming
[1:20:55] can't you see the power of naming
[1:20:58] something
[1:21:00] the Lord Jesus has your original word
[1:21:03] name written in heaven
[1:21:05] but he cannot give that to you now it
[1:21:08] would not match your existence and time
[1:21:11] it would not match your body
[1:21:14] but there you will get your new name due
[1:21:18] to you not new to him look at the power
[1:21:22] of naming so he said well my habit my
[1:21:25] this my that quit naming that devil
[1:21:29] don't look at what look at how
[1:21:40] it is not so much what
[1:21:42] we are to overcome but how
[1:21:45] we are to overcome this is the logical
[1:21:50] for notice it does not matter so much
[1:21:53] what we are to overcome as long as we
[1:21:56] know how we can overcome in Matthew 4
[1:21:59] where in Jesus it's tempted of the devil
[1:22:01] listen Carefree these words beautiful
[1:22:04] absolutely beautiful
[1:22:06] he overcame the personal
[1:22:13] Temptations of Satan by the word
[1:22:17] and by the word only not by the
[1:22:21] anointing
[1:22:23] the Bible doesn't mention nothing about
[1:22:25] Jesus feeling anything
[1:22:27] he overcome by the word
[1:22:30] notice now they were so they were so
[1:22:34] made for him no one else could Satan
[1:22:37] even use this against them so the
[1:22:39] prophet I'm so glad that he allowed this
[1:22:41] to be said this way he overcame the
[1:22:43] personal Temptation don't you understand
[1:22:45] why Satan knows us so well it probably
[1:22:48] scare us to death if we knew how well he
[1:22:50] knew us
[1:22:51] and he has your Temptations and tests so
[1:22:55] personalized he knows you to the T
[1:23:00] but we know him too we're not ignorant
[1:23:02] concerning his devices
[1:23:05] notice this he overcame the person of
[1:23:07] Temptations of Satan by Satan I'm saying
[1:23:10] rather by the word and by the word only
[1:23:12] in each of the three major trials
[1:23:15] that corresponded exactly to the
[1:23:18] Temptation Of The Garden of Edom lust of
[1:23:20] the flesh lust of the eye and the pride
[1:23:23] of life Jesus overcame by the word he
[1:23:26] fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan
[1:23:28] by failing to use the word Adam fell and
[1:23:31] direct Disobedience to the word but
[1:23:34] Jesus overcame by the word notice next
[1:23:37] paragraph and his own personal life
[1:23:41] these words are astounding to me
[1:23:45] contending
[1:23:47] with himself
[1:23:54] was contending
[1:23:56] with himself
[1:23:59] now I want you to think
[1:24:02] Jesus recognizing
[1:24:05] that his flesh was now a Target
[1:24:09] and Satan was trying to pull
[1:24:13] on his Humanity
[1:24:15] and Jesus must defeat
[1:24:19] himself
[1:24:21] so his Temptations were not well this
[1:24:26] drinking problem and this woman problem
[1:24:28] and this he never focused on what
[1:24:32] but he focused
[1:24:34] on who and how
[1:24:38] you mean the Lord Jesus the blameless
[1:24:40] sinless Son of God
[1:24:43] yes
[1:24:45] but remember the prophet makes them
[1:24:46] astounding statements about that human
[1:24:48] body
[1:24:50] and he says even the Flesh of Jesus
[1:24:54] could not glory in the presence of God
[1:24:57] oh I know it took some of you Jesus
[1:24:59] owners but it's time you get choked down
[1:25:02] you'll never see yourself right if you
[1:25:05] don't see him right
[1:25:07] look at him but small their children
[1:25:12] he had to contend with himself
[1:25:16] Jesus had to speak to Jesus
[1:25:22] and say Jesus
[1:25:23] you've got to obey the word
[1:25:28] but Jesus said to Jesus
[1:25:32] I don't want to
[1:25:35] I don't want to die
[1:25:37] I don't want to suffer
[1:25:42] Jesus the deity had to speak to Jesus
[1:25:45] the humanity and said you're going to
[1:25:48] obey me
[1:25:52] I'm here for this reason I'm here for
[1:25:54] this purpose you're going to the coast I
[1:25:57] don't want to
[1:26:00] even prays a prayer that he knew the
[1:26:04] father would not and could not answer if
[1:26:07] it be thy will let this cup pass from me
[1:26:10] I'm so glad father God didn't answer
[1:26:12] that prayer
[1:26:18] in his own personal life contending with
[1:26:21] himself he overcame obedience to the
[1:26:24] word and Hebrews 5 7 it says who in the
[1:26:27] days of his flesh when he had offered a
[1:26:29] prayers and supplication was strong
[1:26:31] crying and tears
[1:26:34] unto him that was able to save him from
[1:26:37] death
[1:26:39] so Jesus mother Joel is crying he's
[1:26:43] crying and calling
[1:26:45] calling Spirit God I'm begging
[1:26:48] please don't let me go through this I
[1:26:51] you
[1:26:53] don't make me face this please
[1:26:56] thank you
[1:27:03] Oh Glory to God
[1:27:05] supplications a strong crying and tears
[1:27:09] unto him that was able to save him
[1:27:13] so the savior
[1:27:15] his crime
[1:27:17] for the father to save him
[1:27:21] from being a sinner no
[1:27:24] from dying and becoming sin
[1:27:28] don't make me do it
[1:27:30] don't make me do it
[1:27:32] please
[1:27:34] don't make me do it I beg you
[1:27:42] but that he was able to save him from
[1:27:45] death
[1:27:46] and was heard
[1:27:48] in that he feared
[1:27:52] can you imagine the Lord Jesus
[1:27:56] being so afraid brother Jackie
[1:27:59] Jesus fearing
[1:28:04] maybe he'd already seen it read the book
[1:28:06] of Isaiah 53 and many of the other
[1:28:08] places and he could imagine himself
[1:28:10] hanging on the cross
[1:28:12] all my bones they stare at me they laugh
[1:28:15] at me
[1:28:16] they put out their lips at me
[1:28:20] he saw them or he saved himself he can
[1:28:23] he saved the other let him save himself
[1:28:25] the Bulls of Bayesian Compass me about
[1:28:29] Psalms 22 it's proceed your great
[1:28:31] Shepherd psalm read it
[1:28:35] you see it was the victory of Psalm 22
[1:28:38] that led him to the Sheepfold of Psalm
[1:28:41] 23.
[1:28:44] maybe reading in the scripture and
[1:28:46] imagining in his mind how can a mortal
[1:28:49] face this I can do it I just can't
[1:28:52] again
[1:28:53] I can't face it
[1:28:57] can you imagine when Satan heard him say
[1:28:59] it
[1:29:04] I'm afraid
[1:29:07] I hope you don't misunderstand me but
[1:29:10] I'm so glad
[1:29:12] he allowed himself to feel that
[1:29:15] how many ever gets afraid in life
[1:29:19] just get afraid
[1:29:21] let's get afraid afraid of the unknown
[1:29:22] sometimes afraid of the known
[1:29:25] afraid of things that around you not
[1:29:27] certain house that's going to turn out
[1:29:28] and how is this going to be you just get
[1:29:30] afraid
[1:29:33] but don't forget when you do
[1:29:35] you could go to High priests and say
[1:29:37] Jesus I'm so afraid
[1:29:40] I'm so afraid of today I'm just afraid
[1:29:43] of today
[1:29:44] I'm afraid I'm going to fall again I'm
[1:29:46] afraid of this I'm afraid of that
[1:29:49] I need a high priest
[1:29:51] who can understand me
[1:29:55] you can answer back and say son
[1:29:58] I know that feeling
[1:30:01] I understand the feeling of fear let me
[1:30:04] take you on a journey when I was on The
[1:30:06] Garden of Gethsemane I was shaking I was
[1:30:08] trembling I was in such profusion of
[1:30:11] prayer that the capillaries broke in my
[1:30:13] in my forehead
[1:30:15] in my bloodstream entered entered into
[1:30:18] the sweat glands and I sweated great
[1:30:20] drops of blood you see it was not just
[1:30:23] out of thinking of hell it was not of
[1:30:25] that but I was so afraid of the pain I
[1:30:28] was afraid of the agony I was afraid of
[1:30:30] being left alone I was afraid I feared
[1:30:37] so I understand
[1:30:40] anybody here have fears besides me
[1:30:47] but don't you guys got a high priest
[1:30:49] that we can go to and you say Lord I'm
[1:30:50] afraid you're afraid why no longer if I
[1:30:53] get down at that Altar and get saved you
[1:30:54] ain't got the Holy Ghost he was the Holy
[1:30:57] Ghost
[1:30:59] but even though he was deity in that
[1:31:01] body it did not did not take away
[1:31:04] the humanity
[1:31:06] and the fear
[1:31:09] oh Lord God
[1:31:11] though he was a son yet learned he
[1:31:13] obedience
[1:31:15] of the things which he suffered and
[1:31:16] being made perfect he became the author
[1:31:20] of Eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:31:23] obey him
[1:31:26] what was he obedient to the word of God
[1:31:28] now then there will not be one person
[1:31:30] who will sit in the Throne of the Lord
[1:31:32] Jesus Christ unless he's been living
[1:31:34] that word not just talking about it but
[1:31:37] living it your prayers your fastings
[1:31:40] your repentances no matter what you
[1:31:42] present to God none of that will gain
[1:31:44] you the privilege of setting in that
[1:31:46] throne
[1:31:47] it will be granted only to the word
[1:31:50] bride that's the stronger the king is
[1:31:53] shared with the queen because she's
[1:31:55] United to him so only they
[1:31:57] who are of that word
[1:32:00] even as he is of that word
[1:32:03] will share that
[1:32:05] throne
[1:32:08] I mean it wants to be part of that one
[1:32:11] can I have a few more minutes
[1:32:14] Paul says in Romans 8 37 day
[1:32:17] and all these things
[1:32:20] we are more
[1:32:23] than conquerors
[1:32:25] through him that loved us
[1:32:28] I love this word it means to be more
[1:32:31] than a conqueror to gain a surpassing
[1:32:36] Victory literally in the translation it
[1:32:39] means this
[1:32:41] we are super
[1:32:44] conquerors
[1:32:47] amen super conquered why we're part of a
[1:32:51] super race we belong to a super sign to
[1:32:55] a supersede and we're going to a super
[1:32:57] City divide designed by a super almighty
[1:33:00] God so we are not just barely conquerors
[1:33:04] but we are super we are conquerors on
[1:33:08] spiritual steroids
[1:33:11] we are super conquerors I want to just
[1:33:14] say this to you our face is not
[1:33:17] destroyed our hope is not gone our love
[1:33:21] is not diminished our sight is not
[1:33:24] blinded our intuition from the presence
[1:33:28] of God we are more determined now than
[1:33:30] ever before because greater is he that
[1:33:33] is in us than he that is in the world we
[1:33:37] will bear the glory because we bear the
[1:33:40] shame we will set with us in him and the
[1:33:43] throne because he can try us now and not
[1:33:47] treat us like a bunch of babies
[1:33:57] and you see friends here's the key
[1:34:00] we conquer
[1:34:02] when we learn to conquer
[1:34:04] ourselves
[1:34:06] Romans 5 2.
[1:34:09] Paul says by whom oh shall we have
[1:34:11] access by faith unto this Grace wherein
[1:34:13] we stand
[1:34:14] and rejoice in the hope of the glory not
[1:34:17] only so
[1:34:18] but we glory in Tribulation Lord have
[1:34:21] mercy
[1:34:23] we Glory
[1:34:25] and tribulation knowing that tribulation
[1:34:29] workers patience I didn't put the rest
[1:34:31] of this down but I quote it for you
[1:34:33] tribulation workers patience patience
[1:34:36] experience experience hope hope maketh
[1:34:39] not ashamed because the love of God has
[1:34:42] been shed abroad in our hearts by the
[1:34:44] Holy Ghost which is given unto us we
[1:34:47] don't just endure tribulation we don't
[1:34:50] just endure trying but we glory in them
[1:34:53] why because we know we have found favor
[1:34:57] in the eyes of God
[1:35:00] oh my we are so far from being conquered
[1:35:05] by them they do us much good
[1:35:10] well brother Donnie always knew you're
[1:35:11] crazy now I know you've flipped over
[1:35:13] well I hope that I have I hope I get so
[1:35:16] far out of my mind that I have the mind
[1:35:18] of Christ that I'll get to a spot I'll
[1:35:20] believe what he said if you don't if you
[1:35:23] don't if you don't it won't make no
[1:35:24] difference I'm going to take him out his
[1:35:26] word
[1:35:28] Hallelujah
[1:35:33] second Corinthians 2 14. now thanks be
[1:35:36] unto God which always
[1:35:39] calls us to Triumph in Christ
[1:35:43] and make us manifest the savior of his
[1:35:48] knowledge
[1:35:50] by us
[1:35:52] in every place
[1:35:54] or if you only could catch that
[1:35:57] listen what this man is saying he calls
[1:36:01] us always calls us to Triumph in Christ
[1:36:04] and make us manifest the Savior or the
[1:36:09] incense
[1:36:10] the incense
[1:36:13] of his knowledge
[1:36:15] by us
[1:36:16] in every place you see the imagery
[1:36:19] Paul chose to use you know Paul was a
[1:36:22] very a very typologist of a guy and he
[1:36:24] used so many images I love his images
[1:36:27] because he looked at himself here at the
[1:36:30] church as a trophy of God's victory
[1:36:35] and he said what I'm doing and what you
[1:36:38] brothers and sisters are doing we are
[1:36:41] the sweet aroma
[1:36:43] of his victory
[1:36:46] because he conquered us then he will
[1:36:49] take us and Conquer others
[1:36:51] through us
[1:36:53] praise be to gospel Paul considered
[1:36:56] himself as a conquered trophy of
[1:37:01] Christ's Victorious power
[1:37:03] now remember by this time when he writes
[1:37:05] second Corinthians he's back in jail
[1:37:07] again and he goes from one jail to
[1:37:10] another from one city to another but
[1:37:13] Paul sees himself as part of the
[1:37:16] triumphant entry of Christ himself into
[1:37:19] this city
[1:37:21] so here Paul would come and say me and
[1:37:24] Jesus have come to take over
[1:37:26] praise God now he's quoting the
[1:37:31] triumphal entry of the Romans
[1:37:35] Oh Glory to God you see they would lead
[1:37:39] them about so the Romans would conquer
[1:37:41] the Greeks the Athenians whoever they
[1:37:44] would conquer they would get many of the
[1:37:46] mighty celebrities of the city and then
[1:37:49] they would take incense and they would
[1:37:52] run before the Chariots and the incense
[1:37:55] was the introduction Oh Glory to the
[1:37:59] Victorious March so here was thousands
[1:38:02] times thousands of Roman citizens and
[1:38:05] they're lined up across the streets and
[1:38:06] they knew today was a triumphal entry
[1:38:09] because they had took God they had took
[1:38:11] Britain they had took this and that and
[1:38:13] the other and they would stand there and
[1:38:15] they'd smell the aroma and the incense
[1:38:17] and Paul said can't you all say what I'm
[1:38:19] doing God's having me thrown in one jail
[1:38:21] after another and we know when he got
[1:38:23] down there in Philippi and he got to the
[1:38:25] mother places God let him be able to
[1:38:27] lead people to the Lord Jesus you
[1:38:29] imagine was Paul down there and that one
[1:38:31] Roman guard according to history Paul
[1:38:33] LED one Roman god to the Lord Jesus and
[1:38:35] the man had a new birth about the
[1:38:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:39] what did God do God allowed this man to
[1:38:42] carry the incense of a resurrected life
[1:38:44] for the Lord Jesus inside there and
[1:38:46] there was a Roman Heathen about like a
[1:38:48] Tennessee Heathen or a Kentucky Heathen
[1:38:50] or an Eleanor Heathen or a Virginia
[1:38:52] either and the Lord God allowed this
[1:38:54] man's life such a sweet smelling savior
[1:38:57] of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:00] and that Roman said
[1:39:07] they tell me you're a preacher
[1:39:13] I've got all kinds of Gods
[1:39:17] smelling all the time
[1:39:21] but you smelled it I mean you you act
[1:39:23] different than my priest still
[1:39:25] the bride does
[1:39:28] all glory to God
[1:39:31] glory to God
[1:39:33] let me give you a little history
[1:39:35] one Pompeii
[1:39:37] triumphed over Africa
[1:39:40] his Chariot was drawn
[1:39:43] by elephants
[1:39:49] when Mark Anthony conquered
[1:39:52] his Chariot was drawn by lions
[1:39:57] when Helio gaboulos
[1:40:00] conquered his chariot
[1:40:03] was led by tigers
[1:40:06] when Aurelius had conquered
[1:40:09] his Chariot was led
[1:40:13] by deer
[1:40:16] isn't it amazing all animal nature which
[1:40:19] seemed unable to conquer
[1:40:23] but you see by Conquering the elephant
[1:40:25] can you imagine
[1:40:27] hooking up elephants to a chariot they
[1:40:29] could take a big trunk of theirs pick
[1:40:31] you in the Chariot and the whole thing
[1:40:32] and throw you however far they wanted to
[1:40:34] but yet you are showing your conquering
[1:40:37] Power by having these massive elephants
[1:40:40] pull you a little 160 or 70 pound man
[1:40:43] don't you understand why the Lord Jesus
[1:40:47] is going to allow his people to be a
[1:40:49] conquering tried people we are his
[1:40:53] victory
[1:40:55] Hallelujah it will not be great cherubs
[1:40:58] that'll lead his Chariot it will not be
[1:41:00] Mighty archangels that will be the
[1:41:03] crescendo of his victory it'll be little
[1:41:05] Housewives it'll be young men that were
[1:41:08] so Bound by drugs and alcohol Bound by
[1:41:11] pornography and this and that and the
[1:41:13] other and they even looked at himself
[1:41:14] and said I'm totally hopeless I've been
[1:41:16] in this situation for so long but the
[1:41:19] Conqueror got a hold to their life and
[1:41:21] then he'll it hits you and I up by the
[1:41:24] glory of God and say Lead Me Now oh
[1:41:27] Hallelujah take my name take my power he
[1:41:32] don't want you to just do it in heaven
[1:41:34] he wants it to do in the workplace where
[1:41:36] you are let the Lord Jesus chain us to
[1:41:40] his chariot
[1:41:43] say take me
[1:41:45] to the masses
[1:41:54] take me to the Lost
[1:41:58] not a tiger not a lion not an elephant
[1:42:03] a man born in sin a woman born in sin
[1:42:07] Changed by the power of God and Horn
[1:42:11] into harnessed up to the buggy of the
[1:42:13] word of God for the end time
[1:42:16] I told you years ago when I was in South
[1:42:18] Africa and I'll close to this in Durban
[1:42:20] but the name you now do which is an
[1:42:22] Indian brother
[1:42:24] Durbin has a large large concentration
[1:42:26] of East Indian people
[1:42:28] and there were thousands times thousands
[1:42:30] and thousands of those people there for
[1:42:33] one of those great Hindu festivals
[1:42:36] and they would have little small groups
[1:42:38] maybe eight or ten over here eight or
[1:42:39] ten over there and eight or ten over
[1:42:41] there had a little tiny uh timbering
[1:42:44] type things symbols little tiny things
[1:42:45] they go to plan them things and going
[1:42:47] back and forth neighbors dancing and
[1:42:49] carrying on off us ever was and there's
[1:42:51] one particular person that's all
[1:42:53] gathering around
[1:42:55] telling me what they're doing this man
[1:42:58] is going to be the man
[1:43:00] that they're going to hook a buggy to
[1:43:03] they have 33 million gods
[1:43:07] and goddesses
[1:43:10] so they would stand there and they'd
[1:43:12] dance and dance and dance
[1:43:14] all of a sudden this guy that they're
[1:43:16] going to hook him up to he'd let our
[1:43:18] blood curdling scream
[1:43:21] brother nammy said he's now ready
[1:43:23] they would start out with a big long pen
[1:43:25] like this start weaving it through his
[1:43:28] tongue poking a hole in his tongue
[1:43:30] that's sticking out of his mouth
[1:43:32] that take fish hooks brother Ram talked
[1:43:35] about it they'd take fish hooks and hang
[1:43:37] apples and grapefruit and hang them all
[1:43:40] over his body then they'd take two big
[1:43:42] long grab Hooks and put right in the
[1:43:45] back this man's back like this take his
[1:43:48] skin and put it up and feed this hook
[1:43:50] through his back
[1:43:51] and then run ropes to the back of this
[1:43:54] man and him pulling this Carriage
[1:43:57] representing this deity I saw some of
[1:44:00] them the weight of that carriage and it
[1:44:03] would tear a hole Plum out in their skin
[1:44:05] leave a big old place
[1:44:08] blood running down their bodies for what
[1:44:12] false gods idolatry
[1:44:17] but who was the best representation of
[1:44:20] them so-called deities their
[1:44:22] constituents
[1:44:24] who's the best representation
[1:44:27] of a conquer of an overcomer the day
[1:44:30] we're living here
[1:44:31] it may not always be a man
[1:44:33] it may be a woman
[1:44:35] it may be a little daughter of God
[1:44:37] that's attacked by this or that or the
[1:44:39] other and yet the Lord God uses hers we
[1:44:42] look the other night at Tabitha and what
[1:44:44] a life little Tabitha dork has had
[1:44:47] God hooked her up to his buddy to
[1:44:50] display himself
[1:44:52] oh friends forget about well if I can be
[1:44:55] this person give me that big buggy give
[1:44:57] me what difference does it make what
[1:44:59] size it is
[1:45:00] my goodness if I ain't got enough trust
[1:45:03] in the Lord and if I ain't got enough
[1:45:05] reputation that he has to tie me up to a
[1:45:07] little red flower wagon y'all know what
[1:45:09] them are don't you man they're antique
[1:45:11] now a little video guys about that big
[1:45:14] if that's all he can tie me up to all
[1:45:17] buried I'll pull it
[1:45:22] I'll pull it with all my strength
[1:45:26] I'm in the same parade as the big guys
[1:45:29] I'm in the same parade of the Mighty
[1:45:32] Warriors who's pulling tons and tons and
[1:45:36] tons and they say look at poor little
[1:45:38] brother Donnie he just got that little
[1:45:40] Radio Flyer wagon that's all right
[1:45:43] Jesus matched me up to that wagon I'll
[1:45:46] pull it with all my might
[1:45:51] about it
[1:45:59] Hallelujah
[1:46:05] Lord Jesus
[1:46:09] to him that overcome us
[1:46:15] what about it man women boys girls
[1:46:20] your temper
[1:46:22] bitterness
[1:46:24] sexual sins
[1:46:26] whatever it is
[1:46:29] it's not what
[1:46:31] that's how
[1:46:33] how
[1:46:34] do I overcome
[1:46:36] by the word
[1:46:38] he said but brother Donnie the Lord
[1:46:39] Jesus wasn't tempted by marijuana I know
[1:46:41] that
[1:46:42] he wasn't tempted by pornography I know
[1:46:44] that
[1:46:46] but there's only three ways a human
[1:46:47] being can be tempted that's the lust of
[1:46:50] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[1:46:51] pride of life
[1:46:53] so he faced the channel of Temptation
[1:46:56] that every Mortal would ever face
[1:46:58] and he overcome the channel not the what
[1:47:02] he didn't have to face pornography he
[1:47:03] didn't have to face marijuana he
[1:47:06] overcome the channel and said do as I do
[1:47:10] let me hook you up to the buggy
[1:47:13] take me on the job with you
[1:47:16] let them smell the aroma of Christ in
[1:47:20] you the hope of glory
[1:47:22] let them sense that your life has been
[1:47:24] changed
[1:47:25] praise the Lord
[1:47:29] praise the Lord
[1:47:32] and he would say to the Lord Jesus today
[1:47:34] Lord
[1:47:35] that's the greatest desire of my heart
[1:47:37] to be an overcomer
[1:47:40] would you just stand to your feet
[1:47:42] those of you that that's your desire
[1:47:44] we don't want to just raise our hand
[1:47:45] today if we want to stand
[1:47:53] so it doesn't really matter
[1:47:55] what it is
[1:47:57] but how
[1:47:59] how do I do it
[1:48:01] I do it by the word
[1:48:03] [Music]
[1:48:06] oh I want to do so much for God I I want
[1:48:08] to do something for god brother darling
[1:48:10] well let me tell you how to do it
[1:48:12] the way to do something for God
[1:48:15] is that God help you
[1:48:18] overcome yourself
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:21] that's the ones he uses to conquer is
[1:48:24] the conquered in the Kingdom of Christ
[1:48:27] the conquered are the conquerors and the
[1:48:31] kingdom of the devil those who are not
[1:48:33] conquered are the conquered ones
[1:48:36] they will never overcome their self
[1:48:39] and Satan in the end gets them all
[1:48:42] and the last one to be destroyed and
[1:48:46] that burning fire will be Satan himself
[1:48:52] maybe for millions and millions of years
[1:48:55] he will burn and turn and toss
[1:48:59] and be haunted
[1:49:02] but eventually he himself will be
[1:49:05] destroyed
[1:49:08] and when there is no more devil
[1:49:12] you will still be shouting the Praises
[1:49:14] of almighty God
[1:49:16] you the one that looked like you could
[1:49:18] never overcome you the one that it
[1:49:21] seemed you would never be able to face
[1:49:24] it and the liar who told you that no
[1:49:27] longer exists and you are praising the
[1:49:31] Lord God for eternity
[1:49:34] Hallelujah
