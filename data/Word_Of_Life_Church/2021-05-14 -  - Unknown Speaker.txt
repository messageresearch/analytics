[Music] thank you lord [Applause] [Music] praise the lord thank you lord jesus and that's the truth i tell you friends it's just incredible and almost unbelievable from week to week the things that are happening in our nation and our world i'm so glad that our hope is not in anything less than the lord jesus and his mercy amen where would we be brother darrell and i was talking about it before the services but the dawning word would be be if one trust the lord i said like everybody else out here nuts just nuts that's all you can say thank god for his mercy you can imagine since monday over 1250 rockets have landed in israel by now it's even more than that that was of today the last report that i've heard of it so by now it's probably hundreds of more and yet some of the people in our nation are condemning them for defending themselves we've got congressmen we've got senators we've got so be like somebody you go home and somebody's robbed your house and they're eating your taters and eating your maters and sleeping in your bed and you go in and grab out a bald bed or a mixer or whatever you've got and say hey get out of here and people in your neighborhood say well rosa matthew you're some mean you're so rotten jim babe you'd run that thief out of your house you look at it in the natural sense of israel trying to defend their place and you look at the bride we're under a barrage as well a barrage of missiles and rockets from satan of sickness and worry and frustration and all kinds of things but we know god has his eye on his promised people as he does the nation of israel so does he his wife does he stop all the rockets no israel has what they call the iron dome and they're able to stop many many of them but they don't stomp them all we've got more than an iron dome we've got the blood and the mercy of god and the love of god but even with that he doesn't stop all the onslaught of hell but we know when he allows them to come through it's for our good amen aren't you glad praise the lord gracious and that in the name of the lord certainly privileged for us to be gathered together again tonight turn with him if you would in saint john chapter 3 verse 19. we'll read verses 19 through 21 we've been speaking about getting into the spirit i think this is about part 33 maybe something like that and really it boils down to two things the influences of two kings it's actually a tale of two kings one is the king of darkness king of lies king of deceit the other is the king of light king of peace king of deliverance he is our goel or our shalom and it comes to this simple simple thing light and darkness fighting they fight in our bodies they fight in their homes they fight in our church and our world but we have the promise light will prevail so mention to you i think last weekend when we read this earliest wednesday the scripture that john 3 16 is probably one of the most famous scriptures in the bible but i wonder sometimes how many people know john 3 19. you see people rejoice because of john 3 16 but they don't realize the consequence of when you turn down verse 16 then you have to deal with verse 19. and this is the same lord jesus that said god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the same lord jesus said this and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil now bring it down to america this is the condemnation that light has struck the nation of america but the majority of americans love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil and now our nation is turned into hell the democrats will never bring it out the republicans will never bring it out she's finished [Music] that's right for everyone that doeth evil hateth light now here's the master himself and he certainly of anyone would know how to word this in such a way that would be just and true and i want you to notice in the way that he deals with these next two verses for everyone in verse 20 that doeth evil hateth light now he does not make excuse for them and say well really it's because they don't understand they really just don't see it if they saw it then they would do better he doesn't even approach it that way but he approaches it from the destiny of the soul or the darkness the everlasting chains of darkness that permeate from the souls of some that will never be quickened and notice how he places them categorically as if though they've already been judged for every one that does evil ongoing it's present tense and as a matter of fact many of them will never stop it everyone that does evil hate us so if they do us evil they hate us light they cannot just do evil and say well you know i really don't want to be a christian i really don't believe that word but you know i'm just going to kind of leave them people don't know if they do evil they hate lying always i know some good people and they don't never say nuts and only reason they don't because you ain't never crossed them right some of your friends you don't ever really lay the truths out there so you don't know what attitude they're going to have that's right but if they're ever exposed to light and they're of darkness they will have this darkness attitude for everyone that does evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light notice it's not possible that they will they will not they will not no never impossible no no hope friends we're dealing with many many people in this age that our souls in prison their souls are held in chains of darkness for everyone that does evil hateth the light neither come us to the light lest his deeds should be reproved now notice and then on the other side he says but he that does truth cometh to the light how in the world can a person do truth without seeing light and it shows the graduation of light and the way that god deals even with the elect but it still comes back to do us what you do what you don't do notice jesus identifies both groups by do us so they that do us evil in verse 21 he that does truths cometh to light now you don't come to light first read your bible he don't come to light first something begins to move on him he's from another land but he that does truth cometh to light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god now let me read you this involvement gilead 1959 cleveland tennessee our spirits has been born from above and in that land glory to god where we come from oh my god in that land where we come from the nature and the habits of that land is holiness cleanliness godliness if the spirit of that land moves into us then this land is strange to us might as well say amen and go home it's been good to be in the house of the lord this is it friends in simple terms it's the spirit of two lands light and darkness the spirit of two kings so if in that land where we come from the nature and the habits of that land is holiness cleanliness godliness if the spirit of that land moves into us then this land is strange to us because your soul and your spirit motivates you it makes you what you are and you'll never be able to join churches and get that out of you you'll still be a church member and make fun of people who preach against such immorals you know why you feel different tonight because the spirit of that land is living in you you know while the world hates you the spirit of this land lives in them i may like to be remembered tonight as we pray let's bow our heads together if you would lord it could not be said in more powerful profound terms i think so great yet so simple that it's the spirit of that land where we come from the very reason judas lived the way he did in the realm of deception and he must have been quite a deceiver because according to what we're able to read in the gospels there was not one of those elected apostles ever picked up anything about him that was negative in so much that when you said one of you is going to betray me they questioned themselves before they even questioned him is it i is it i is it i they went around the table because he was so close to the original of what they could see without the holy ghost they picked up not one thing but you knew all along who the betrayer was but once they received the holy ghost then they looked back and they began to see what their carnal eyes could not see he was of another land lord god i pray that you'd help each of us tonight may we lord as your people come under the influence not so much of this land but that land we are from that land is a land of holiness purity righteousness godliness forgiveness divine nature foreknowledge predestination a land of election a land of eternal life father may our spirits our souls be under the influence of that land for it is a land of light speak to us tonight father we pray we ask for illumination in the name of the lord jesus and we all say amen god bless you you may be seated you see no matter how much the lord jesus would have ever tried to preach and convert judas he could have never been converted he was baptized in water by the lord jesus like the rest of the apostles as a matter of fact the prophet tells us that when judas got baptized the devil got baptized so the devil must have wanted to know how it feels to be baptized in water so he allowed himself to be inside judah's body in such a way that when the lord jesus would have taken them down now there was much water in salim there was water and genocide there was water of course in the jordan so there was various places that they could have baptized and satan wanted to know himself you know what i think i'd like to get baptized today i hear jesus is going to baptize his disciples i think i'll let him baptize me you see it's not enough when we take people down in this pool up here it's not enough for them to come up and cry and say i'm sorry i want to be a better person they've got to be a new person so satan allowed himself to go in to this first step second step but he could not go into the changing of the soul to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and the soul he accident went farther in this day than he went in the day of judas iscariot in so much that satan in the form into the form of arthur godfrey elvis presley pentecostal preachers message preachers and other false anointed ones instruments that satan in their soul would be able to experience the baptism of the holy ghost in their spirit it was even closer in this day than it was when judas was here himself one of the mysteries of the end time that people can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour of their life and still die lost and go to hell well praise the lord what a good way to start out the meeting tonight you see a person can have it in their spirit talk in genuine tongues have genuine gifts even stand up and preach and still be lost because they're lost from the soul out not the spirit so judas went went into the depths of god understood mysteries a partaker of the original ministry divinely imparted to him by the lord jesus himself his gifts were not inferior his understanding was not inferior so if you'd have been around peter james john the men of those day hearing them talk about the revelations of god the light that illuminated them judas would have been right there no doubt he could have talked about what the great things was that they understood whenever they come back rejoicing judas come right back and said i cast out devils in your name i heal the sick in your name you say how in the world could he have done that being a devil it was by the two greek words that was used in the new testament for our english word power one of them is excusia and the other is dunamis excusa is a delegated authority by one who has power to give you you you you you me whoever it is authority to do certain things but it has nothing to do with your own innate nature excusa would be similar would say to a police officer or a sheriff or a deputy or a state trooper that would be given power and authority to pull you and i over to write us a ticket to impound our car to put handcuffs on us whatever more because they've been given that type of power but it really has nothing to do with how much they weigh they might be as oh my they might be a little guy there might be a heavyset guy they might be brown yellow has nothing to do with the race the gender it is a delegated authority the lord jesus sent out the apostles not by dunamis by inherit nature but rather by excusa which was a delegated power you see he knew that satan would fall from the beginning so he separated his logos from the dunamis being on the logos itself if not then satan once the logos was written in word form anybody that could have full access to the power of god all that had to do is memorize the word then with the word would come the dunamis so it separates the invigorating power of the livelihood of the power of god away from the written word so it has the word written people memorize it they quote it and they even break into a certain element of it to make it live but it does not make it rhema word until the anointing of the hour falls on that lugos and then it quickens it and satan never has access to that so judas was able by excusa to cast out devils heal the sick so he sent them out to the two we don't know who went with judas the bible doesn't really say but judas had power to heal the sick perform miracles cast out devils whatever more like a trooper or say police or whatever more by that authority but he had nothing by innate nature now dunamis is something that comes into the individual as we said it before that we get our word dynamite from this word dunamis so it's something that's from within it's not just a delegated authority that you can do with or without a godly life but dunamis imparts not only power to lay hands on the sick but it imparts power in you to be able to annihilate the very nature of sin that we were born with and look for it it's not enough for us around the message to have excuses we must have dunamis it's not enough for us just to play tapes listen to me don't get mad you can play tapes every day of your life you can keep the tape going on your phone in your house 24 hours a day and be as lost as you can be because the tapes are not the token come on now i know that's contrary to what's being projected in this day you find me where the prophet of god ever said the token or the tapes the prophet said the token is the holy ghost it is that literal life of the lord jesus coming back inside of you and i now in this land that we are from we become baptized or immersed into that land which is christ jesus as i said opening up that is israel is under the barrage even this very hours i'm talking to you of all types of attacks from hamas and from all these other counter-terrorists and things that are going on and what do they want they want them to leave they want their land well look at it spiritually and see the bride of christ around the world has been under a barrage of attacks by satan in the last year so more than ever before why he wants you to forsake your land and say well i can't do it no more it ain't worth the fight no more i can't deal with this sickness this out the other but if you're a real seed of abraham you're going to stay on your land and say you devil i'm warning you right now you're trespassing and lord friend when god brings a deliverance for you whether it's a healing or a deliverance of a besetting sin whatever it is don't become confused or discouraged whenever the devil will come right back and try to take that land away from you or bring that same sickness or that same besetting sin and you find yourself being tempted by the very same thing that god delivered you from and you think what in the world's going on nothing going on it's the devil that's trying to give you back that sickness but you need to stand there look if netanyahu could stand there and warn the palestinians and say look you all keep coming i'm warning you now we're going to take this land and when we do we're going to push you farther back than you are now and we are not going to give you this land i think we need to serve the devil that notice tonight for those of you that are battling sickness or oppression or financial straits whatever it is in your home you need to give that devil a warning and say look you better get back because i'm giving you a warning right now as the son of god as a daughter of god i'm going to push against you and i'm going to push and i'm going to push and what i take i am not giving back so you better get gone while the getting's good because i'm not the majority but jesus in me are the majority and he's promised me healing he's promised me deliverance he's promised me peace he's promised me power whatever i need from my journey i've got a whole checkbook praise god made out in my name all i've got to do is sign it and claim the promise but will you have to fight you will you'll have to fight to get it and you'll have to fight to keep it but as children of abraham that's what we do that's who we are it's never been the way of the children of god to have everything handed to him on a silver platter daniel was not handed to him shout right me shack in a bid to go their victory was not handed to them you imagine they had to buy it so do we have to battle it was not handed to the prophet of god he had to fight and the prophet said when you get saved it's a fight from the time you get saved until the day you die but we are willing to accept every challenge that satan brings against us why because we are not fighting for ourselves we are not fighting for our agenda our agenda is of the kingdom of god our nature is of the kingdom of god our plan is of the kingdom of god we are not our own we belong to him therefore what he wants us to do is what we will do we will take our land we will fight for our land and we will keep our land hallelujah praise the lord and of course the devil will try to do you like some of the left-leaning and politicians in america want to do israel shame on you all for defending your land shame on you all for doing this shame on you all for preaching this and preaching that you ain't shaming us this is our land this is our territory this is our rights as the people of god those who have left this message have given up their land they want to dress the way they want to just act the way they want to let them do so but i'm not doing it that's not my land my land is a land of holiness a land of righteousness amen a land of purity a land of godliness look friend our land is a land of healing it is a land of miracles it is a land of supernatural power of god it is a land of angelic oh praise god it is a land of angelic visitation as a son or daughter of god you have a right to angels visiting your home [Applause] so it's up to us we can go down in our bomb shelters and hide under the bunker oh devil ease up ease up ease up oh my i remember years ago when i preached on demonology and my it's been several several years ago but all hell all hell seemed like it broke loose against our church so many people started fighting all types of sicknesses all time it was absolutely unbelievable and one day when i was in prayer and i was waiting on the lord and just i pray and then i wait brother baby said the problem is when we pray we do all the talking and he said we ought to pray and then listen for a while and be quiet so i waited and i waited on the lord and the lord wouldn't tell me nothing the lord was really silent and i've learned that whenever god's silent satan sure loves them opportunities then he'll come to you and he'll go to try to talking to you so i prayed and i talked to the lord and i waited on the lord and then i i just got signed a little bit and said well lord i'm gonna let you talk and the lord didn't say nothing well i just laid there on my face and laid there for a bit and the lord said nothing well old blabber mouse come up and he said i'll tell you what i'll do i'll make a deal with you you let up on me and i'll let up on the church i'm going to tell you something friends you think that preaching singing worshiping obeying the word of god does not absolutely destroy satan's kingdom that satan who who am i some little video spindly to before a preacher that does nothing done nothing amounted to nothing in life but demons out of hell would want to make a deal with you wonder why i didn't go to biden or trump or go to putin or some great person you know why we call them great because we don't know what greatness is i'll tell you who's great it's a sign of god down on their knees not just a preacher now but somebody that knows how to bombard heaven with prayers anointed by the spirit of god oh my when i heard that voice oh it's you know as a human being and say oh my i mean i just laid there brother weston as i heard that and something rose within me some of y'all probably remember me telling this years ago and something rose was in me and i said satan i will not let up on you as a matter of fact i'll preach more god gives me the more i'll preach it and the longer i'll preach it i'll make this series last as long as the holy ghost gives me unction now listen friend you realize what we are coming against that it's not against these people i hear so much it's not against this man or that woman or this church or that church but it is powers of darkness that we are warring against and they want to be able to take everything they can away from us that the lord jesus has given to us i'm sure you feel the same way as i do i don't want anything that does not belong to me i don't want something that belongs to someone else whether it comes to preaching whatever more i want only what god wants for me that's all but i do want what has my name on it i do want what has my name on it now if it's got my name on it i'm not going to fight you over my prison but i am going to take it away from you if you've got it why because it belongs to me and if he then belongs to me i want it deliverance belongs to me it's got my name it's got the package right there and it said to donny from jesus well guess what i'm gonna get that package i might be the last one to get it but it's got my name on it and that's the way you need to do the promises of god when they've got your name on them you stand right there i don't care what hell says and if hell came back and said i'm going to do this other you stand there toe to toe and said there's one thing you ought to know i know by now you are a liar you're a liar satan and i do not believe you so get back to hell and take your box of rattlesnakes back with you hallelujah you see it's the spirit of the land that refrain don't you understand what the lord is trying to bring to his people in this hour but brother dawn it's such struggles i know that i realize it's such struggles but our god is victorious oh my right in the midst of such difficult times it's during such times that his profound mercy and grace is able to anoint his people and their faith rise to a level that surprises them when it doesn't why because it's not just them it's him doing it [Music] let's pick up again what was looking at wednesday night ii corinthians 3 17. now the lord is that spirit boy i'll tell you one thing this used to be one of my favorite scriptures in pentecost oh i love this scripture and i was ignorant about it but i loved it i sure love it now now the lord is that spirit and what the spirit of the lord is their liberty now that was one of our favorite shouting quotes in pentecost those of you that was in pentecost you know what i'm saying that boy we get up here hallelujah oh by the spirit of the lord is our liberty oh but get the music going and everybody hallelujah there's liberty well now i look back and realize a lot of that was just emotional work up by the music because a lot of them people that was shouting really didn't have no liberty in their life because it's bound by sin so now we look at it in a total different light that where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty liberty to do what do whatever you want to do no you still ain't saved yet now notice what this liberty leads to now this where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord now it absolutely marvels me even i think about myself has been the pentecostal preacher and how many times i quoted this other verse about whether it was liberty but i don't remember quoting verse 18 very often at all because i didn't have an open fail i didn't have an open face i did not have a mirror to look into so i just shouted over the above verse and shouted over the top of verse 18 because i didn't understand it the first 17 made me shout out to be having a spell tonight at verse 18 shouldn't you now think of it but we all with open face to unveil or uncover by drawing back a veil we always open face beholding us in a glass which is already last wednesday night is not a clear glass but rather a mirror to show in a mirror to look at oneself in a mirror to behold oneself in a mirror but how strange that paul conveys this with open face beholding us in a mirror the glory of the lord so here we've got the mirror of god in our hands and we're looking and we're supposed to see ourself but instead we see the glory of the lord now remember the mirrors of this ancient times were a burnished type of metal so they would polish it really bright unlike our mirrors today and whenever the looker if it was outside or even inside the house and the light would catch it real bright it would actually hit the burnished metal and it would bend it and refract it and it would come right back and shine upon the face of it it would actually blind you it would actually blind you you could take and bend it to where it would come back and if you looked at it long enough it would put your eyes out because it was so direct so here paul says that we with the veil taken off of our face and we're looking into the mirror of god's word and we begin to see he said the glory of the lord changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so the gradual motion of the change into this image is expressed by the terms that he used when he said changed into the same image so the present tense implies a gradual transfiguration which is what the word change is a gradual transfiguration both mystical and spiritual and it is produced while we are contemplating christ now satan broke into the same thing and it is the power of spiritual assimilation so the world looks at all of these things that satan gives them and they look at pornography on their phones and they look at all these types of movies and they look at all the stuff that's going on in the woke their deal out here all the stuff that's happening all around us and what do they do they assimilate into what they are feeding upon they actually become that and the word assimilate is to process of the process of becoming a part or making someone become a part of a group country or society so the sphere of darkness is actually projecting all of these images that people don't know if they're man or their woman so you know the common practice among some of the people especially the left-leaning and the progressives and the liberals is that whenever they have children that anymore they don't check on the birth certificate whether it's male or female they leave that open so the child can pick which one it wants to be praise the lord in australia they're fixing to pass laws to where if someone is homosexual and they give their heart to the lord and they want help and they would seek counsel of the preacher not that the preacher tries to push it on them but they themselves ask for help that they need to be ministered to to break away from these tendencies the man can be arrested and canada our neighbor to the north they're trying to pass the legislation that either mothers and fathers cannot talk to their children if their children if it's a girl she wants to be a boy or vice versa that they will imprison the parents of those kids if they try to convert them now what's happening then the laws of sodomy are being put before the people come on children say amen and what is it doing assimilating into sodomites and the last days the prophecy as it was in the days of sodom thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed so there is a great power both positive and negative in assimilation notice this in joshua chapter 1 verse 8 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate meditate therein day and night now okay just in case you're wondering i do believe in the power of meditation but not transcendental meditation but the meditation of a son or daughter of god on the promises of the word i dare say let me adventure here tonight and say we probably most of us even holy ghost filled saints do not meditate enough on the good things of god there is great power in meditating notice you notice a person that leans toward sickness so much and they just talk sickness and they oh you know they they claim they're sin well my sugar and my blood pressure and my this and my that what were you doing claiming that thing or it may be in your body but that don't mean that it's yours you need to send that thing right back where it comes from well my low blood my high blood my no blood and my my this and my that don't you claim that thing the devil will talk you into it and the next thing you know it's part of your family well come on now saints you need to meditate and the way you say well the doctor says i've got him that the symptoms are there but by his stripes i am healed i'm going to do whatever i've got to do to be able to take care of it but this ain't my diabetes this ain't my cancer this is not my high blood pressure come on saints why because the power of meditation look at people that all the time talk about sickness and live in the realm of sickness and they catch everything coming and going and some things that don't come and go they catch you too and they spend years of their life in the realm of sickness every time you get around them they've got something wrong with them and they're all the time dealing with this and that and the other it's a miracle they live to be past 30 because they're constantly talking about well hallelujah my you ought to spend more time meditating upon healing and upon miracles and upon the goodness of god instead of thinking of everything all oh my they got covered i've got i've got a temperature oh lord i've got covered oh no no no but yet what should we do why sure covet is real we know that it is but i don't think we should live under the fear of it 24 hours a day oh god oh god i've got it once oh god i'll get it again no if it comes again we'll factor it the same way we did the other time as we do other things but we don't need to meditate but we've let our smartphones fill our minds with so much news reports about this and that and the other how many of you get good reports of healing and miracles on your smartphone but it's negative this and negative and negative something else and you come to church and sit there like a bullfrog eating buckshot and you're as negative and down and low as you can be and then you wonder why it's your diet it's what you're feeding all that's why you're feeding on you're not meditating on the good things of god this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate you understand what he's talking about here psalms was not included in this wasn't yet written proverbs ecclesiastes jeremiah nehem zachariah zephaniah malachi obadiah only five books and what it contained thou shalt and thou shalt not thou shalt and thou shalt not thou shalt and thou shalt not but there was power in meditating on the torah this is why when you see the jews especially the orthodox and the elder orthodox those with their lawn the men that's got the little curly deals and the hats and all this thing and you've seen pictures of them and i've seen it also naturally they're going to the wailing wall the western wall so they have them separate the men over on this side and they have a wall there and the women on the other side and whenever they're standing up there they're doing this and they're little curly deals they're jumping around as they do it and man i'll tell you what i'm thinking oh lord i'm glad i don't have to do that i'll be sick on a horse they're sinning just like i don't see how they even read the book because they're jumping back and forth but according to the way they understand it the psalms in the book should bring such excitement to them that they can't stand in the same place that it ought to bring such joy lord have mercy if the law does that to a bunch of jews what about the covenant of grace to the bride of jesus christ the book this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success i mean he wants to be a successful christian i talk about how much money is in your bank account now i'm talking about being successful in god notice psalms 1 i love this first psalm blessed is the man that walketh not on the council of the ungodly nor stand us in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate day and night now don't raise your hands but i wonder how many of us meditate how much time do we give to meditation on the good things of god you ever watched people i've watched people you've heard me say that before and i watch people when i go to doctor's office in different places and you watch the people of this age they cannot hardly even hit the chair before they've got their phone out husbands and wives sitting at the dinner table in restaurants i just saw it this week they don't even talk both of them's on the smartphone two dummies on smartphones now what do you think is going to happen to their marriage that's right do you understand that even psychologists and doctors are saying that the american people are losing the ability to talk all they know is snapchat and instagram and facebook and text they can't even carry on our president can't even talk they know what they're doing keeping them cameras away from that dude [Music] or you say poor old father do you want your youngans to grow up the same way that all they know how to do is use their thumbs god gave us a mouth to talk to praise to worship but his law his delight his delight his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law dost he meditate day and night all this psalm here psalm 19 14 to me oh it's one of one of my favorite let the words of my mouse and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my strength my goal you talking about a word how in the world could the psalmist david ever say such a thing by the west that knowing that he only had a law a torah an animal sacrifice and yet this man is praying with the new testament understanding this couldn't even happen in the old testament because the soul is not even converted listen let the words of my mouth now what david has done if you read this verses preceding this david is praying about different sins and lord keep me for this and keep me from that and forgive me for this and then david comes oh my he comes inward and said now lord i want you to perform a miracle in me it was a miracle when he made the universe it's a miracle when he made life but when he converted you it was one of his greatest all-time miracles cosmic light cosmic dust couldn't tell him no the planets couldn't say no they couldn't wrestle against his will but you were born to fight him your flesh born lost you were born to rebel against him but he performed a miracle in you praise god he performed a miracle in you and now you don't fight him no more you don't hate him no more you love him so much you live every day of your life for him it is a miracle you are a miracle let the words i hope you don't misunderstand me man's heart is one of the greatest creations of the universe it is actually called the crown jewel man's heart the crown jewel of the universe i know some of you think your head is where it's all at uh-uh the devil chose your head [Applause] god chose your heart he used eve's head in the garden of eden but god chose man's heart it is one of the greatest creations of almighty god the crown jewel of the universe from the heart oh and the heart can be so wicked it can be so vile and jeremiah said who can knows the heart but when god comes in i'm talking about these muscles and you're bumping i'm talking about that something in you that animation that animation amen not the muscle the door that beats and beats and beats but that's something inside of you the new fish your soul what's this let the words of my mouth in the meditation of my heart let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my crown jewel now watch how he does this let it be acceptable he's taking a man and joining the thoughts that come from the heart and spoken out of his lips and making them as a sacrifice to adonai oh may my words and my thoughts be a treasure of sacrifice acceptable oh lord now let me ask him you think god accepts gossip he's saying god accepts it whenever someone will tell us maybe a lie against a brother or sister we go to church with and we don't follow through like the scripture said to try to check that thing out we just like the person and we believe them and then we tell somebody else and they tell somebody else and now we're in the chain of spreading a lie against a brother or sister now you think god accepts that no i'm wondering how much of our speech how much of the meditation of our heart is acceptable and then we wonder why we're no closer to god it's quite simple friends the reason none of us are any closer to god it's as simple as it can be you can take your finger and point it this way not toward me now some of you would like to do that your other point toward me or your wife or your young ones or but just point it where it belongs right here towards you now some of your sisters don't cut your hair some of your brothers haven't smoked in years you haven't drank in years and years but right here's what you're missing your mind is so caught up with current events and you're trying to figure out who's the truth look friend you don't even know who to believe anymore you don't know which news caster is telling the truth you don't know if it's the bbc the cnn nbc fox news this one let me tell you i've found the great news source and you can totally trust it it's god everybody else you better take with a grain of salt all but they're conservative yeah right they're conservative according to them but the lord god is our source of truth and may i go on and say that god has a body on the earth and ministers on the earth that are interested not in political parties and political agendas but they are interested in preaching messages that will bring faith to the hearts of god's people in order to get us out of this hail that we're living in so he prayed against the sins of the body the sins of the flesh now he's praying against the sins of the mouth and the sins of the thoughts of the heart for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he oh you see i want my thoughts he says i want my words to be acceptable like a sacrifice was outspot brother donny what would i have to talk about if i didn't talk about gossip you want me to give you a list [Music] if i didn't talk about people in the church what would i talk about healing miracles peace faith deliverance heaven is that good enough for a starter for you that ties you over to sunday notice psalm 63 6 and when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches psalm 77 12 i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of all thy doings now are we as people in this age and society should we be concerned about the things going on of course should we be concerned that some hackers hacked the gas deal and you can't buy gas diesel yeah unless you've got a horse and buggy i'd say you should be concerned but don't do like people are doing in north carolina and virginia and tennessee going to the gas pumps and having knocked down drag outs fighting literally fighting over who gets the gas if you could get people that determined to go to church wow well the devil attacks them on wednesday and they say all right devil come on come on come on come on i'm sick and tired of you you backache you headache my lumbago my this and shut shut that up devil that ain't my big toe hurting that ain't my lumbago that's your lumbago that ain't my kidney stone that's your kitty come on come on come on i'm going to church i'm going to the house of god no doubt that man of god's prayed he said it he's got the leaking of the lord i'm going to get something from god come on devil come on let's just settle it right now come on but instead we just say why think honey one's just streamed or not yeah we could i've been out running all day went to walmart k martin oh okay martin hope no more i went to walmart and it's a big lot so i want to save a lot and save a little and save more and i went to all them places i'm more slap out well you ought to be ashamed yourself doing that on church today [Applause] why say we stream i hope the lord don't hand a lot of you folks that think it ain't important to go to the house of god a streaming button for the millennium god never intended for streaming to replace going to church i know i know there's people that can't go to church but some of you who can and stay home because you're lazy you're going to be in trouble [Applause] well hallelujah psalm 77 12 again i will meditate also of all thy work and talk so i'll think about it and then i'll talk of all thy doings psalm 104 34 my meditation of him shall be sweet i will be glad in the lord psalm 119 verse 15 i will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways and he needs help [Applause] first timothy 4 14 neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on the hands of the presbytery notice this meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that though that thy profiting may appear to all philippians 4 18 finally brethren oh look out devil whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are whatsoever sayings are whatsoever things are where's facebook where's instagram the gospel of google has replaced the gospel of god for a lot of people they got to google it they don't know nothing about matthew martin luke and john but they sure trust gates well his wife don't i'm not sure you should [Applause] there may be a little something that we ought to look into we put all of our confidence and all in our trust if you can find it on google google is not the absolute our god and his word is our absolute oh my whatsoever things aren't lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise praise god think think think on these things brother don't you live so apart from reality do i oh you don't have to get out here in the world and and work like all the rest of us and you don't know nothing about our troubles ah when you get about three or four weeks come see me and i'll tell you about what i deal with in the day you realize how fortunate you are not to be a preacher you see a preacher has to do this same thing friends i deal with deaths i deal with divorce i deal with improprieties of every imaginable thing than things you cannot even imagine i deal with things that if it was not for the grace of god a modern-day pastor in this day would go out of his mind under the pressure and stuff you deal with i have to do this myself if not you'll be coming to see me in the insane world so you have to apply god's word not as a family not as a church but as an individual well my nature has always been negative my daddy was always naked my mama but you're telling me you're supposed to be born again and you've got another parent and this is what your parent told you to you see as we look upon him we are assimilating his glory why don't we have more of it we're not thinking enough about him [Applause] sure you get up in the morning you want to know what's the latest is japan still on the map is israel still on the map sure you're going to read the news but don't read it all day long don't let your head be stuck in negative stuff all day long get out your bible get out the prophet's tapes and put them in your home and play them [Applause] my mind listen to this speaking of the prophet you know the way to find god y'all ready for this what's so deep oh i hope you can get it you know the way to find god is to meditate upon god think of god don't you see why satan holds our minds captive and with many of us it's not on sinful things it's just so many problems [Music] your nephew's sick your niece is sick her poodle has got the flu your aunt has got this your uncle has got that your grandpa's got this how many prayer requests do we turn in i i fear it like you do i feel it like you do every prayer because my thing lord have mercy on these poor people and we're we're cold heartless people if we just hear them and hear and forget about it but we're a people of god that love how can we hear such things and it not affect our hearts how can we hear of india having 400 000 new closest of cases of covet every day 4 000 people a day dying many of them are brothers and sisters in the message and not feel for them we have to feel for them but we've got to find a place somewhere to be able to cast our cares on him or it will drive us crazy we won't be able to take it david spoke of it how he would bind the laws on his bedpost i would meditate therein day and night if you notice it as the disciples on the road to emmaus that while they were speaking to each other concerning the lord jesus there he stepped right out of the bush and walked with them and if our minds would be more taken up on god and the things pertaining to god lord children it would be so much easier to live a victorious life in christ my you ought to put that on your refrigerator on your microwave on your toothbrush on your toothpaste on your mirror have it right there say devil get out of my way i'm claiming my mind back i'm claiming my time back can't you see it don't even have to be sinful wrong things that some christians cannot live a victorious life well i ain't got no sin in my life i don't drink i don't smoke i don't do that i don't know why the world's wrong right here you're just not thinking about him enough it's your aunts and your uncles and your cousins and and the price of oil and the price of this and the price of that and then satan knows for many people who have the holy ghost he ain't going to get them caught up and drinking he ain't going to get them caught up in pornography and all kinds of stuff for the world so what you do just get them caught up in the business of life but i'm taking it back oh what the devil done stole from me i'm taking it back oh my and if our minds would be more taken up on god and on the things pertaining to god no it would be so much easier how many could use for your christian walk to be a little bit easier every day [Applause] okay all right i gave you the script this is your prescription from dr donnelly reagan jr so now you can take him to the drive through and say all right god i need your help your servant read this from the message of the hour it's just as important to me as the seals or the thunders or anything else that prophet taught i need this field in my life lord god i need this field in my life and it's not that i've been thinking about evil and wrong and terrible terrible sinful things out there but just the things of life just the things of life do you all ever stop shut off your radio shut off your computer shut off your phone and just sit and meditate but see this way we meditate we want to hope because we're so busy and we're so important turn your dings off your bells off your whistles off so that devil won't aggravate you some of you love your smart form when you love jesus some of you might as well be honest you need delivered because you've got addicted to that thing [Applause] well i didn't get many amens on that i don't even know my well it sends you this to the how much screen time you spend every week don't it if it don't set it up so at the end of the week you can see how much time you spend on it you spent two hours and 57 minutes this week 16 up from last week and just write yourself an app or have somebody do it for you and see how much time you spend talking to jesus this week you spent 13 minutes and 28 seconds you're down 22 from last week and then we wonder why we struggle and we struggle let's stand oh my can i reach you one more here i'm blind bartimaeus also but in a different city there in phoenix as and as we said as he did in the days gone by it's time that bartimaeus now if our meditations is taken off of our church affiliations if our meditations taken off of our work or off the superstitions that we have in our mind superstitions that we have in our mind and place them upon him and his presence he will come and do the same thing tonight he did for blind bartimaeus on that day can you imagine it changes from the natural battles and struggles and things of life in a very simple equation by taking so much of our thoughts away from things that are around us and putting it on him and that releases his power to do what he did for bartimaeus which was what open up the eyes of a blind man not by fasting not by praying you know 14 hours straight but by changing the pattern of our thinking amen god i need help god i need deliverance god i i need this lord i thank you for all that you've already done i thank you so much lord jesus and all of a sudden there's a miracle right in front of you a miracle has happened and you say well how did that happen brother donnie wasn't here brother daryl never prayed for me no it happened because your mindset changed oh my he will come and do the same thing tonight that he did for blind bartimaeus on that day if we'll just do it if we'll just keep our mind stayed on him and notice it's when we're thinking on those things the bible said if there be any praise if there'd been a virtue think on these things now i want to ask you a question what good does it do is to come to church and sit in the meeting and ponder and maybe discouraged because we didn't get a prayer card or may be discouraged because of some ill saying a neighbor did or discouraged about one little matter or another that keeps christ lord have mercy children you mean he he ain't talking about us thinking of evil things or wicked things just us becoming so discouraged in church because we didn't get prayed for or somebody said something against us and that keeps christ away from us why we assimilate into the negative thoughts and that negative stuff so and so don't like you so-and-so said you noticed they wouldn't speak to you before church they wouldn't shake your hand before church and there you set the whole service is mulling over that and you're the lords wanting to deal with you speak to you and them thoughts just keeps him away from you oh god help us that keeps christ away from you it's when you're sinking on it that's when the disciples after the resurrection was going down to the road at emmaus and they were speaking about him that's when he appeared to them we got our minds on too many things of the world if we would throw those things off our mind and think about him his soon coming there'd be more revelations and power in the church but we keep thinking about the things notice he's not mentioned sins he's not mentioned wicked horrible awful things just things what am i going to do tomorrow oh my lord everybody that's not guilty of that even i can't say amen to them why we're humans i didn't know that he don't have to get you to thinking about somebody else's wife he knows he don't have to worry about bothering you with robbing a bank but just to divert your thoughts for a few minutes what am i going to do tomorrow oh man i don't think i unplugged my curling iron i hope it's just sisters that think that i don't think i turned off the crock pot oh no you know as well as i do that devil has hit you with thoughts that's to be so simple why he knows you'll sit there and assimilate the whole service the beans spilled over and it caught the counter on fire the cat the the cabinets is on fire but now you sit in your mind your whole house is up in smoke as soon as i said stand you hit the door you're gone you get home and say and what would you do you forfeited the whole service because you allowed satan to put it in your mind and you so assimilated you started sweating listen to me friends is it true with thoughts we can assimilate so much into those thoughts we can become paranoid what could it be by the if we could so assimilate into the presence of god every time we come in here and we would leave this building in rapture oh praise god let me close there'd be more revelations and power in the church but we keep thinking about things what am i going to do tomorrow what am i going to do next week will i hold my job will this be and those things are in the hands of god think on christ i've got to read one more ken it takes meditation on the lord to bring him in your presence i went monday after brother jim and i had lunch together to see brother eugene sister janet i sat on his little chair there and we talked for a little bit he said brother donnie i don't think it just happened that you come by today i believe the lord sent you by my way you know we've been talking about things of the lord you know things at the end time and just by him saying that thing i felt it in another realm so i could pull over into that right atmosphere and you could just feel it sister janet was there you could just feel the spirit change in the room what was it talking about the government talking about the end time talking about the signs of the time it didn't do it but whenever he broke into his need his need i believe the lord sent you today he said and that quick the spirit of god moved over into that channel and said we're going to pray right now children it's not me contacting god for you it's you contacting god and pulling me in your direction pulling brother daryl brother wes and these other brothers that are preaching you getting a hold of god do you believe you have that ability will you be honest with me tonight and say thank you man of god for telling the truth i needed to hear this tonight be honest with god now i said one more but can i read one you know sometimes we come to church and thinking about what tomorrow got to do this the next day i've got to do that i'm going we come to church we ought to lay aside every thought and everything of the world enter into fellowship with christ and worship meditating worshiping in our hearts and giving songs and praises to him thinking of his goodness and what he means to us worshiping in the spirit singing spiritual songs making melodies in her heart even the bible said if there's afflicted let them sing songs be happy be happy be in meditation always expecting god at any moment to appear to you praise god let's marry it oh jesus every one of you no doubt have needs desires requests something in your heart that you need from the lord maybe you're not sick tonight maybe financially you're done okay at the present no great issues going on in your family on your job but you want to be remembered tonight for this very subject that you've heard you want to meditate more on him sure this doesn't make us so heavenly minded we're no earthly good we will discuss political things we'll discuss the trouble of the world sure we will the prophet did but instead of meditating on that day and night day and night help us to be balanced you'd like to be remembered tonight in prayer both of my hands up too lord jesus first of all i want to say for myself i'm sorry i'm sorry lord i've given my time frivolously i don't think about another man's wife i don't think about robbing a bank getting drunk doing that that sort of thing lord sometimes my thoughts are just so caught up in the sicknesses of your children the worries of your children lord sometimes i just become so so weary of it all lord not just the people of this assembly but people from all over the world that would get prayer requests and emails and texts and whatsapp daily all over everywhere lord help me help me to find that balance god that i feel for your people that i love your people that i pray for your people the lord god i realize but constantly thinking in the realm of death and sickness and divorce and trouble and heartaches and this one done this and this and done that and this and sinned and done this and wrong and that one done that one wrong when this trouble is here and this trouble is there before long it begins to weigh on us lord oh help us jesus these parents are not going to stop being concerned about their children you don't want them to stop but you want them to find a balance in their lives they're not going to stop being concerned about their jobs the economy this that the other but yet lord you don't want it to dominate our lives are sinking you want us to think on whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are of a good report help us or we're honest christians and now we raise our hands before you and say we have been wrong and we need your help would you help us lord jesus maybe some tonight in need of a miracle in their body some need to touch whatever it is father would you move for him father i pray for brother bill younce tonight you say in the hospital lord heaven to have those stents put in his heart and then father being diagnosed with this pneumonia we pray in the name of jesus you had moved for him father may the spirit of god go down right now lord in that hospital room may the presence of god touch him we pray other needs of your children tonight father god we believe what we've heard thinking about you brings your presence near us so if you could move on a blind man's eyes and give him sight because some kind lady he said what is that noise what is that noise it's jesus of nazareth he said oh i've heard of him i've heard of him so he began to scream out jesus thou son of david the prophet said there's no way you heard his natural cry but you heard his face cry hallelujah and his faith stopped you maybe a daughter of god has a need in her body a son of god in his home some of these young people needs in their lives may their faith call reach out to you tonight lord god hallelujah may they stop you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah i'm crying savior savior hear my humble cry while on others thou art calling don't pass me by the lord whatever your need is tonight hallelujah if
