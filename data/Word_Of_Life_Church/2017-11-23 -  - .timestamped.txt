[25:19] Lord Jesus amen God is certainly good
[25:22] amen thank you for all the music
[25:24] brothers well god bless you it's good to
[25:27] be here back in the house of the Lord I
[25:29] trust that the word was a benefit to you
[25:31] last night I mean something that was
[25:33] said that would be an encouragement to
[25:35] you and and your walk with the Lord
[25:37] knowing that we all face we're all on
[25:39] different levels here this morning all
[25:41] of us facing many different things as
[25:43] the Bible says manifold diverse trials
[25:46] and temptations amen we fight the same
[25:49] devil
[25:50] Amen fight the same spirits there's not
[25:53] any of us to here that are fighting a
[25:54] battle that no one's ever fought all of
[25:56] us fight fight similar things but we all
[25:59] served the same God amen and he's more
[26:03] than enough
[26:03] he's sufficient amen as he told Paul my
[26:07] grace is sufficient Paul you know what
[26:09] that word sufficient means enough that's
[26:11] all you need Paul is my grace is that
[26:14] what your desire is this this morning
[26:16] say God give me more grace amen to fight
[26:19] the battle well amen well have you go to
[26:21] your bible in the book of 1st Samuel
[26:23] chapter 30 will have you turn we spoke
[26:32] last night on understanding your cup of
[26:35] pain in the Lord I actually had us going
[26:37] in a different direction that flipped
[26:39] this on it flipped us on it last night
[26:41] and so we'd like to go that direction
[26:43] and I'm just bound as a servant of God
[26:46] to speak what he burdened to me with
[26:48] amen not what I didn't come here to
[26:50] preach what you want me to preach or
[26:52] want to hear amen and I know you
[26:53] wouldn't want me to do that anyway but
[26:55] you want me to be obedient to the Lord
[26:57] as a servant amen knowing that God has
[26:59] all things in control he moves in
[27:01] mysterious ways
[27:03] amen the Spirit of the Lord is not
[27:05] subject to what man's desires or wants
[27:08] are or what you think or what I think
[27:09] many times friends if we'd be honest we
[27:12] don't even know what we need really amen
[27:15] sometimes we don't even know we think
[27:17] that we do but sometimes we don't even
[27:19] know what we have need of you say well I
[27:20] didn't need to hear that one sometimes
[27:22] you don't realize because we're not
[27:23] sensitive to the spirit all the time but
[27:26] that's exactly what we need so we like
[27:28] to to speak on this this morning I'd
[27:30] like to discontinue from where we left
[27:32] off last night I'd like to speak to you
[27:34] on peace in a time of discouragement
[27:37] peace and a time of discouragement we're
[27:41] gonna read out of the book of
[27:42] Philippians 4 and also first samuel 30
[27:44] will begin at first samuel 30 it says
[27:47] and it came to pass when david and his
[27:50] men were come to Ziklag on the third day
[27:53] that the Amalekites had invaded the
[27:55] south and Ziklag and smitten Ziklag and
[27:58] burned it with fire and had taken the
[28:00] women captives that were there in they
[28:04] slew not
[28:05] either great or small but carried them
[28:08] away and went on their way so David and
[28:11] his men came to the city and behold it
[28:15] was burned with fire and their wives and
[28:19] their sons and their daughters were
[28:22] taken captive what a day of infamy for a
[28:26] brother David could you imagine after
[28:29] coming home from victory and your city
[28:33] that you had homes and your wives and
[28:35] your children and your sons and that's
[28:37] all burned ruined smoke ashes
[28:41] you could ask you could ask the question
[28:43] quite fairly where's the Lord and all of
[28:46] this how could this be the footsteps of
[28:50] the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[28:51] my wife's taking captive my sons my
[28:54] daughters you imagine the way that the
[28:57] devil began to torment his mind like a
[28:59] punching bag begin to torment his mind
[29:01] filling with imaginations of haleh's
[29:04] wife was killed and how his sons were
[29:06] had perished and how his daughter's not
[29:08] knowing at this point David has no clue
[29:10] he thinks they're all dead and the Bible
[29:13] says that he came to the city and behold
[29:15] in verse three it was burned with fire
[29:16] their wives and their sons and the
[29:18] daughters were taken captive then David
[29:21] and the people that were with him lifted
[29:23] up their voice and wept until they had
[29:27] no more power to weep David's two wives
[29:30] were taken captive verse six David was
[29:33] greatly distressed for the people spoke
[29:37] of stoning him because the soul of all
[29:40] the people was grieved every man for his
[29:43] sons and for his daughters but David
[29:47] encouraged himself in the Lord what a
[29:52] powerful Scripture David encouraged
[29:55] himself in the Lord the Bible says in
[29:59] verse seven David said to abbath are the
[30:01] priests
[30:02] I pray thee bring me hither the ephod
[30:05] mammoths are brought forth brought
[30:07] through the ephod to David and David
[30:09] inquired at the Lord saying shall I
[30:11] pursue after this troop shall i overtake
[30:13] them and he answered him
[30:16] for thou shalt surely overtake them and
[30:19] without fail recover all so David went
[30:23] he and six hundred men that were with
[30:25] him and came to the brook basore were
[30:28] those that were left behind stayed but
[30:31] David pursued he and four hundred men
[30:34] for two hundred abode behind which were
[30:36] so faint that they could not go over the
[30:39] brook best sort just came out of battle
[30:41] and I was gonna go right back in and
[30:43] they found an Egyptian in the field and
[30:45] brought him to David and gave him bread
[30:46] and he did eat they made him drink water
[30:48] let's move on down to verse 16 and when
[30:51] he had brought him down behold they were
[30:53] spread abroad upon all the earth eating
[30:55] and drinking and danced and this is the
[30:57] Amalekites who have captive their wives
[31:00] and their sons and daughters because of
[31:02] all the great spoil they had taken out
[31:04] of the land of the Philistines and out
[31:05] of the land of Judah and David smote
[31:07] them from the Twilight even unto the
[31:10] evening of the next day and there
[31:12] escaped not a man of them save four
[31:14] hundred young men which rode upon camels
[31:17] and fled and David recovered all that
[31:22] the Amalekites had carried away and
[31:24] David rescued his two wives and there
[31:27] was nothing I love how emphatic the
[31:29] scripture is there was nothing lacking
[31:32] to them nothing lacking to them neither
[31:36] small nor great neither sons nor
[31:40] daughters this was the soldiers they had
[31:42] lost all their wives all the army every
[31:45] man that's why they one of the stone
[31:46] David all their wives their sons their
[31:48] daughters are going but the Bible says
[31:50] there was nothing lacking neither sons
[31:52] nor daughters neither spoil nor anything
[31:56] nor anything that they had taken to them
[31:59] David
[32:00] recovered all David took all the flocks
[32:05] and the herds which they drove before
[32:07] those other cattle and said this is
[32:09] David spoil praise the Lord David
[32:13] recovered everything friends it was such
[32:16] a victory that David had over the
[32:18] Amalekites that the Amalekites were not
[32:20] mentioned for 400 years he whipped them
[32:25] but what a victory could you imagine
[32:27] whipping the devil so bad in your life
[32:29] you don't struggle with that ever again
[32:31] in your life it never bothers you in
[32:34] tempo you can have that kind of victory
[32:36] I believe you can have that kind of
[32:38] victory where the devil can doesn't
[32:40] bother you in that area of your life
[32:42] anymore he beat him so bad they're not
[32:44] mentioned 400 years Philippians chapter
[32:47] 4 let's just look at a couple verses
[32:49] there Philippians 4 if you have your
[32:51] Bible if you do have a Bible turn please
[32:53] and now we have the screen for those
[32:55] that don't have it but if you have your
[32:57] Bible turn to Philippians 4 and keep it
[32:59] handy this morning Philippians chapter 4
[33:02] the Bible says in verse 4
[33:05] rejoice in the Lord sometimes rejoice in
[33:12] the Lord when money's in the bank
[33:15] rejoice in the Lord when you don't have
[33:18] no health problems you're young with
[33:20] strength
[33:21] no it says rejoice in the Lord and again
[33:26] I say rejoice let your moderation or
[33:30] your gentleness be known unto all men
[33:33] the Lord is at hand or is to say the
[33:36] Lord is near be careful for nothing that
[33:39] word careful means anxious be anxious
[33:42] for nothing be stressed for nothing but
[33:45] in everything but in everything by
[33:49] prayer and supplication with
[33:52] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[33:54] known unto God and here's the verse we
[33:58] want to put emphasis on this morning and
[34:00] the peace of God which passeth all
[34:04] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[34:08] minds through Christ Jesus many times
[34:15] when you study for a sermon as a
[34:16] minister you study sometimes for weeks
[34:19] sometimes the Lord gives you a thought
[34:20] months before and you begin to look at
[34:23] it and many minister here would know
[34:25] sometimes for days weeks months you look
[34:27] at things you compare notes you compare
[34:29] scriptures you study it thoroughly
[34:31] making sure there's no nuggets in there
[34:33] that God wants you to see but I just
[34:36] preached the Sermon just a couple weeks
[34:37] ago and I probably laid before the
[34:39] for four days till midnight go in my
[34:42] study and just lay there and lay there
[34:44] that's the first time it's ever happened
[34:46] to me every time I went to study I I
[34:48] couldn't even hardly study God would
[34:50] just call me to my knees to pray and I
[34:53] prayed for hours and hours and hours the
[34:55] Lord de smoove din a strange way but I
[34:57] believe he has something for us here
[34:59] this morning amen so forgive me of
[35:01] things maybe it seems a little different
[35:03] this morning I just want to speak to you
[35:05] from the bird and the Lord has placed
[35:06] upon my heart you believe he's mindful
[35:09] amen of you is mindful of that need that
[35:12] you have amen he's the great Shepherd we
[35:15] believe that this morning let's go
[35:16] before him in prayer Heavenly Father
[35:18] Lord as David said I repeat the same
[35:21] words I will look to the hills from
[35:24] whence cometh my help where does my help
[35:27] come from my help cometh from the Lord
[35:30] the Lord who made heaven and earth we
[35:35] look to you Jesus this morning father
[35:37] and you is all Lord as the Bible says
[35:41] the giver of every good gift creator and
[35:44] author of heaven Lord and life and Earth
[35:47] we look to you this morning the unseen
[35:49] father may you come and do the
[35:51] exceedingly abundant father in our midst
[35:54] this morning God the service will be
[35:56] only what each individual makes it Lord
[35:59] what they get what they expect we're
[36:01] taught so clearly Lord we only get what
[36:04] we expect father may they pull upon the
[36:06] gift of God and the anointing of the
[36:08] spirit that's here this morning Lord and
[36:10] may they receive what they have need of
[36:12] Lord it's our simple humble prayer Lord
[36:16] this morning that when we leave this
[36:18] building that our hearts Lord are not
[36:20] more callous to the word
[36:23] it's our prayer this morning that when
[36:25] we leave this building our hearts are
[36:27] not more distant from you they're not
[36:29] more cold on You Father
[36:31] it's our prayer Lord that our hearts and
[36:33] our lives are not back slit and further
[36:35] away from your grace Lord but it's our
[36:38] prayer this morning that when we leave
[36:40] this building that we'll be closer to
[36:43] Jesus that will be more fervent for his
[36:46] word that we'll be more on fire for the
[36:49] things of God it's our prayer this more
[36:51] that you draw us closer to you and that
[36:54] we grow in grace and a knowledge and
[36:56] truth in your word father may you be
[36:59] with us both speaker and here we ask in
[37:01] Jesus Christ's name amen you can be
[37:04] seated David as we read the story and
[37:11] for any of you who Bible readers who may
[37:13] be read this story recently Aaron did a
[37:16] Bible study on it you find that this is
[37:19] David in a dispensation if we call it
[37:21] that in his life and I've preached so
[37:24] many sermons on David III my middle name
[37:26] is David maybe it's because of that but
[37:29] I've preached so many times that is I
[37:30] love I think it's a powerful thing that
[37:33] God said he's a man after God's own
[37:36] heart and his life was written and
[37:38] described in such detail whereas other
[37:41] men's life you don't have that 3d
[37:43] picture but you do of David and you see
[37:45] the struggles that he went through you
[37:48] get to see his ups and his downs and as
[37:50] his humanity and his asam's you even
[37:53] read the transparency that David has is
[37:56] just amazing to me and always fill it we
[37:59] can learn so many things and glean so
[38:01] many things from brother David David's
[38:05] life as he comes to this place he's not
[38:09] when he comes to Ziklag it's a time in
[38:12] his life where Ziklag if you've looked
[38:14] at this city
[38:15] it's a Philistine City and David takes
[38:18] it from a king that he makes a pact with
[38:21] and David has slayed Goliath that's all
[38:25] in the past he's slayed the Lions and
[38:27] those who were great victories in his
[38:29] life and he had slayed the bear and
[38:31] those were great things and moments of
[38:34] great glory that David had but that's
[38:36] all in the past now and and the boy that
[38:39] everyone was praising and his soldiers
[38:41] had fought foreign and called him the
[38:43] giant slayer that was yesterday and now
[38:47] for today for David he's been on the run
[38:50] from Saul he's been on the run from
[38:53] another king who he's been anointed but
[38:56] yet this King is still on the throne and
[38:58] this is a king who's very jealous of him
[39:01] but David happens to be best friends
[39:03] with this
[39:04] and David has consulted with Jonathan
[39:07] and said why must I suffer at the hands
[39:09] of your father why does he seek to take
[39:12] my life and you find many Psalms where
[39:14] David if you if you compare it with the
[39:17] timeline of his life David is speaking
[39:19] of this struggle that he's having from
[39:22] this pressure that he's feeling I've
[39:24] preached it here before and I'll just
[39:26] repeat it again that you can almost have
[39:28] two versions of David you take version 1
[39:31] of David is that David who has pressure
[39:34] in his life and he's stressed and if you
[39:37] can just take and spend a moment in this
[39:40] man's shoes he's he's constantly under
[39:43] pressure and he's constantly under
[39:46] anxiety knees constantly feeling you
[39:49] know that just that urged where he can
[39:51] never seemingly he can never just let
[39:54] off the pressure he could he doesn't
[39:56] have that fishin hole he could go to and
[39:58] just you know spend time it doesn't have
[40:00] that tree stand he could go to and just
[40:02] let off the pressure but this is a man
[40:05] who's under constant turmoil and
[40:07] constant struggle yet this man has been
[40:10] anointed by the Prophet he's been told
[40:13] that he would be king over Judah over
[40:16] Israel he has been revealed to him the
[40:19] plan of God for his life and the
[40:22] ultimate end of David's life is a crown
[40:24] where he would rule with the crown over
[40:27] Israel God has told him his plan for his
[40:30] life but yet the problem is is that the
[40:33] reality of his life and the promise and
[40:36] the plan God has given him doesn't line
[40:39] up and so many times in our life God
[40:43] keeps us from the plan that he has for
[40:46] us because he knows the reality of our
[40:48] life doesn't always match the promise
[40:50] that he's given us
[40:51] you take sister Sarah and brother
[40:53] Abraham the promise God had given them
[40:56] they could believe it they could accept
[40:58] it they could say a man to the word but
[41:01] the struggle came when they looked in
[41:03] the mirror because the mirror didn't
[41:05] reveal the promise the mirror everything
[41:08] they looked at in everything they felt
[41:10] said I'm old how can this be possible
[41:12] and so many times the struggle and her
[41:15] mom
[41:16] as we've been given the promises of God
[41:18] and we've been told the plan of God for
[41:20] our life but when we look in the mirror
[41:23] the plan and the promise and the reality
[41:25] are conflicting and this was the
[41:30] struggle for David as he knew the plan
[41:33] of God yet here he is under pressure as
[41:35] we said version one of brother David is
[41:38] that David who has trouble and struggle
[41:42] in his life he has trouble on every side
[41:45] he's being hunted down by Saul and he's
[41:49] under stress and he's living out in the
[41:51] woods and he's living in caves and he's
[41:54] running for his life and he wakes up in
[41:57] the middle of the night at every sound
[41:58] he's waking him and ever every time he
[42:01] hears something he he wonders he's
[42:03] having to look over his shoulder if that
[42:05] saul and and you know in any and he's
[42:07] constantly under pressure constantly
[42:09] under stress he's not had a bath in two
[42:12] weeks because he's been living in the
[42:14] woods swatting mosquitoes and fleeing
[42:16] off snakes and and you take that version
[42:19] of brother David and you say boy that
[42:21] sounds like a rough life now let me give
[42:23] you version two of the same man he's got
[42:26] a castle he has $10,000 in his check and
[42:30] his savings account will make it bigger
[42:32] $100,000 in his savings account he's a
[42:35] millionaire a billionaire he has a
[42:37] casualty as the greatest car he has the
[42:40] biggest house he has no trouble he has
[42:43] to worry
[42:43] he has no stress he has no pain he
[42:46] doesn't worry about anything and our
[42:52] human tendency is to go uh I'll take
[42:54] that David I'd rather be that David with
[42:59] no struggle or no pain or no pressure
[43:01] but let me tell you what Bible history
[43:04] teaches us there was never a more carnal
[43:07] corrupt backslidden David than the David
[43:10] without pressure David without struggle
[43:14] there was never a more carnal
[43:16] backslidden tempted mantha than there
[43:19] was when David had no struggle and there
[43:22] was never
[43:23] mores fervent more on fire david than
[43:26] the david who was running for his life
[43:28] and who had pressure and who had stress
[43:31] and who had worried and who had pain and
[43:32] had trials and tribulations but my
[43:35] brother he were had a fervency with god
[43:39] that's why the bible says they could not
[43:42] strange when fiery trials are to try you
[43:44] knowing that the trial of your faith
[43:46] worketh patience as job is we preached
[43:51] on last night it was the struggle and
[43:53] the torment and the pain that calls job
[43:55] to come to a resolve to where he could
[43:57] say though I can't feel God or see God
[44:00] yet he sees me
[44:02] and he knows me and he knows my name old
[44:05] brother
[44:05] sometimes you have to say is the song
[44:07] that they sang I may not know what
[44:09] tomorrow holds but I know who holds my
[44:12] tomorrow I may not have all the answers
[44:15] to the questions of life but I know in
[44:18] whom I have believed and he knows my
[44:22] name
[44:24] David is he comes to this city and
[44:26] Ziklag and you don't have to turn but
[44:28] and you can pull it up some I'm first
[44:30] samuel 27 david said in this heart I
[44:33] shall now perish one day by the hand of
[44:36] Saul there is nothing better for me than
[44:39] I should speedily escape into the land
[44:42] of the Philistines and Saul shall
[44:44] despair of me to seek me anymore in my
[44:47] in any coast of Israel so shall I escape
[44:50] out of his hand David arose and he
[44:53] passed over with the six hundred men
[44:55] that were with him under a Koosh the son
[44:57] of Mohawk king of Gath and David dwelt
[45:00] with a Koosh Gath he and his men now
[45:03] what we do not find in verse 1 of 1st
[45:06] Samuel 27 we do not find it saying that
[45:10] God spoke to David and said you shall
[45:13] now one day perish at the hand of Saul
[45:15] there's nothing better for you brother
[45:18] David
[45:19] then you should escape to the
[45:20] Philistines is that what the Bible says
[45:25] no it's not it we don't read we don't
[45:27] find the text that says God moved upon
[45:30] the heart of David and told him David
[45:33] you know I know I've
[45:34] promised you the crown but you know the
[45:36] pressure is really hot and you may get
[45:38] killed
[45:38] you might just better go settle in sick
[45:41] lag instead till things calm down the
[45:47] Bible doesn't say that does it pull that
[45:50] back up first samuel 27 David said and
[45:53] David said first samuel 27 verse 1
[45:56] brothers if you have it and david said
[45:59] in his heart David said not God said
[46:01] David said in his heart so many times we
[46:05] attribute the will of God and it's
[46:07] actually just the will of man as I've
[46:12] said jokingly before you hear the
[46:14] statement I feel led so much it almost
[46:17] sickens you sometimes I feel lead
[46:20] sometimes the leadership of God is
[46:21] really just the leadership of man that
[46:24] we call the leadership of God you look
[46:28] at people's decisions and you wonder did
[46:30] you eat lead or did you feel led you
[46:34] could laugh it's just a joke David said
[46:39] in his heart David said I shall now
[46:42] perish one day by the hand of soul sir
[46:46] is nothing better David did you consult
[46:49] God brother David did you ask God did
[46:51] you inquire of God that I should have
[46:56] speedily escaped in the land of the
[46:58] Philistines Saul shall despair in other
[47:02] words soul just forget about me you know
[47:04] I know it's not I know God has promised
[47:06] me this God has promised me the king but
[47:08] the kingdom but here's the reality souls
[47:10] running after me I'm tired of the
[47:12] pressure I'm just gonna go settle in
[47:14] sick lag I just won't peace I just want
[47:21] to come I just I just want to relieve
[47:23] the pressure oh I know what I'll do
[47:26] hours the Bible says you've hung out
[47:29] with your own hands you've carved out
[47:32] with your own fingers God didn't build
[47:34] this don't attribute it to God this is
[47:38] something you did David and you know
[47:40] good and well it's on it's nothing more
[47:42] than a cop-out because you're tired of
[47:44] the pressure you're tired of the trouble
[47:45] you're tired of the struggle
[47:47] and so David settles for false worldly
[47:50] peace as many people have settled
[47:55] because of the trouble and struggle and
[47:57] the stress and the pressure so many
[47:59] times people check out of the fight with
[48:01] with the devil sometimes we get off the
[48:03] firing line because we're tired of the
[48:06] stress tired of the struggle tired of
[48:08] the pressure tired of the questions
[48:10] tired of the fears and so David says I
[48:13] shall now perish I know what I'm gonna
[48:15] do I'm gonna contrive a plan and I'm
[48:17] gonna go to the Felicity and Ankush and
[48:19] notice what David does and it was told
[48:21] Saul that David was fled to Gath and he
[48:23] saw no more again for him you say well
[48:27] see there David made a good decision and
[48:30] it worked
[48:31] keep reading David said unto a Koosh if
[48:35] I've now found grace verse 5 in thy eyes
[48:37] let them give me a place in some town in
[48:40] the country that I may dwell there for
[48:43] why should I serve and dwell in the
[48:45] Royal City with thee and a Koosh gave
[48:47] him sick lag that day wherefore Ziklag
[48:50] pertain earth unto the kings of judah
[48:52] unto this day at that time and the time
[48:55] that David dwelt in the country of the
[48:57] Philistines was a full year and four
[49:00] months and so David because of the
[49:03] pressure because of the trouble rather
[49:05] than continuing in the struggle David
[49:07] checks out of the struggle to settle and
[49:11] by temporary false peace and my brother
[49:15] and my sister so many people have
[49:17] settled for false peace because if they
[49:20] be honest they've they're tired of the
[49:22] struggle they're tired of the stress I
[49:24] know it's not of God and I know it's you
[49:27] know I got to repent for it but you know
[49:29] I just need oh I just need a break
[49:30] brother Matt you don't understand I just
[49:33] need a I need a reprieve from all my
[49:35] troubles I I know I'm not consulted god
[49:38] no I'm not asked God no I'm not inquired
[49:40] of God but I just need a break can I can
[49:46] you kind of get some slack here can you
[49:48] cut me some slack God just give me a
[49:50] break I'm I'm tired of the pressure I'm
[49:53] just gonna settle in six like sick legs
[49:55] fine it's a good City I could have my
[49:57] children there I can
[49:59] plant vineyards we could build a home
[50:00] and everything will be fine and Ziklag
[50:03] old but david don't you realize you're
[50:05] cutting yourself short
[50:07] God wants to give you the kingdom and
[50:09] you're settling for Ziklag God wants to
[50:15] give you the crown but you're settling
[50:17] for Ziklag oh why are you settling but
[50:20] the crown means struggle means stress it
[50:22] means trouble oh but the great will be
[50:25] the glory of fuel endure for a season
[50:27] always the Bible says the temporary
[50:29] light affliction of this present time
[50:31] shall not begin to compare with the
[50:34] glories that God has waiting for those
[50:37] who endure to the end oh my brother it
[50:40] is not revealed who's the son and
[50:42] daughter of God and he who starts the
[50:44] race because many start but the ultimate
[50:47] revealing isn't he who finishes the race
[50:52] and David has dwelled as many others
[50:55] have settled as it clag and they've
[50:57] built a house in sick leg they still
[50:59] love godless and I'm not saying David
[51:01] didn't love the Lord he didn't go and
[51:03] serve a bear he didn't go and serve a
[51:04] God of bail he didn't start worshipping
[51:07] and letting his children worship you
[51:08] know he David do not backslide into the
[51:10] world David just decided I'm still gonna
[51:13] serve God I still believe in Jehovah but
[51:15] I'm gonna dwell in sickling and many
[51:20] people have checked out because of
[51:21] stress and they've checked out from
[51:23] reality to fantasy you say all but I'm
[51:25] here this morning brother Matt and I'm
[51:27] here but are you really here I want to
[51:30] challenge you this morning you say well
[51:32] I'm here Anna are you really here are
[51:34] you really here is your heart and your
[51:36] purpose is right or are you just
[51:38] fulfilling the religious duty and
[51:40] pressure of their conscience telling you
[51:42] you should come to church on Sunday
[51:44] morning are you really here this morning
[51:48] Oh as you take a company you have
[51:50] employees who are there for one reason
[51:51] check in and check out now there to
[51:54] collect a paycheck they don't want to
[51:56] deal with any of the problems then you
[51:58] have people who believe that
[52:00] company they believe in the inspiration
[52:01] behind it and God is not looking for
[52:04] soldiers who want to check in and check
[52:06] out on Sunday and Wednesday God is
[52:09] looking for an army
[52:10] who says I get behind my King David and
[52:13] I want to fight in their front lines for
[52:16] my field Oh can you say Amen this
[52:20] morning I want to be a soldier brave and
[52:24] true keep on the firing line and David's
[52:29] like many others have settled for false
[52:32] peace David as we said this word and if
[52:36] you just turn quickly here to John
[52:39] chapter 14 if they didn't want to pull
[52:41] it up on the screen Jesus says in verse
[52:43] 26 he says but the comforter which is
[52:46] the Holy Ghost John chapter 14 whom the
[52:50] father will send in my name he shall
[52:51] teach you all things and bring all
[52:53] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[52:55] said I have said unto you know here's
[52:57] verse 27 I want to key in on John 14
[53:01] verse 27 Jesus gives these words and he
[53:06] says notice this peace I leave with you
[53:12] now this is John 14 this is in the midst
[53:16] of Jesus's Gethsemane this is in the
[53:18] midst of the trouble and the midst of
[53:20] the pain and the struggle and Jesus is
[53:22] going to say I'm struggling right now
[53:24] but here's my message to you peace I
[53:27] leave with you my peace I give unto you
[53:34] so the peace of God is a gift from God
[53:38] let me say it clear it is your right to
[53:41] have the peace of God in your life it is
[53:44] the inalienable believer to have the
[53:47] peace of God oh that makes me happy I
[53:50] want to say hallelujah this morning it
[53:53] is the right of the believer to have the
[53:55] peace of God God is not the author of
[53:57] chaos God is not the author of confusion
[54:01] my peace I leave are given to you not
[54:05] notice don't be mean don't misunderstand
[54:09] not as the world giveth give I unto you
[54:13] I'm not giving you the kind of worldly
[54:16] piece you see worldly piece is very
[54:19] different than biblical piece worldly
[54:22] piece is very different than godly piece
[54:25] Jesus says this is the piece I give unto
[54:29] you my peace I leave with you not as the
[54:32] world gives but this piece that I give
[54:34] is very different it's more than just a
[54:37] cliche it's more than just a song that
[54:40] you've seen it's more than just
[54:41] something you learn about in Sunday
[54:43] school Jesus is telling you I'm gonna
[54:45] give you a gift then you'll have
[54:47] throughout trouble and tribulation and
[54:50] trial and struggle my peace I give unto
[54:53] you you see the worldly pieces Jesus
[54:56] says what is pieces we ask that question
[54:58] what is peace then the world defines
[55:01] peace in these words and you can give
[55:05] synonyms peace is the sense of calm and
[55:09] tranquility quietness peace is bliss and
[55:15] contentment and well-being that you feel
[55:19] when you believe everything is well I'm
[55:24] describing to you the peace that the
[55:26] world gives it is bliss and tranquility
[55:29] it's the feeling of just relaxed that
[55:32] everything's okay and when does this
[55:34] peace come when you have no trouble and
[55:36] no trial and you have no problems and no
[55:39] issues there's just a sense of I'm just
[55:41] at peace everything's peaceful this is
[55:43] the way that the Webster's defines it
[55:46] it's a sense of peace is the sense of
[55:48] tranquility the attitude of a settled
[55:51] quiet that comes when you believe
[55:57] everything is ok and everything is the
[56:00] way that you like it that's nice I said
[56:08] and that sounds so pretty oh can we just
[56:11] read that again such bliss and peace
[56:14] tranquility no trouble everything's fine
[56:20] no struggle and let me say this friend
[56:22] this is the peace that people have
[56:24] settled for but it's a false peace
[56:28] let me say this it's a very shallow
[56:32] piece calm feelings quietness
[56:37] tranquility can be produced by appeal
[56:42] calmness and quietness and tranquility
[56:45] and calm can be produced once you get an
[56:48] inheritance of $50,000 suddenly there's
[56:51] a peace and a calm but let me say this
[56:53] any manufactured or manipulated piece is
[56:56] fragile and can be broken at a moment's
[57:00] trouble
[57:02] that's the peace that the world gives
[57:04] and let me say brother many people have
[57:06] settled for this peace they've settled
[57:08] for alcohol because it gives them a calm
[57:11] or a relaxation or a relief from the
[57:14] struggle and the trouble oh my brother
[57:16] or my sister if that's a trap and a
[57:18] snare for you let me tell you it's a
[57:21] fragile peace it'll never hold you or
[57:24] keep you but there is an alcohol there
[57:26] is a stimulation of the Spirit of God
[57:29] that you can drink of that never passes
[57:32] away they've settled for nicotine or
[57:36] drugs or some some pill that they could
[57:38] take oh we don't have a lot of drug
[57:40] addicts that smokey legal drugs are
[57:42] taking legal drugs but we got a lot of
[57:44] what we call religious pills we have
[57:50] more people addicted to prescription
[57:51] drugs than they are so illegal drugs off
[57:55] the street Christians believers for the
[57:59] matter you hammering against me I'm not
[58:01] brother I'm here to tell you sister
[58:03] God can set you free of that you're
[58:05] settling for a false peace you're
[58:08] settling for a false hope and it can
[58:11] shatter you in the moments notice when
[58:13] you don't have it you're shaking and you
[58:14] Bri you can't breathe and you've got to
[58:16] have it and it's an addiction that get
[58:18] the devil and the snare and a trap that
[58:19] the devil has trapped many people false
[58:28] peace peace of feeling you say what's
[58:30] wrong with filling of calm there's
[58:31] nothing wrong with that and all those
[58:32] things God gives you all those things
[58:35] God does give you and their attributes
[58:37] of peace but let me say this
[58:38] that kind of piece can be produced by a
[58:40] lie some people are living a lie of
[58:44] peace they can be produced by a
[58:46] deception they can be produced by a nap
[58:49] you take a nap you feel peace you go to
[58:51] Disney World you say brother man is
[58:53] there anything wrong no not necessarily
[58:55] anything wrong with those things I do
[58:57] many things in my life and have many
[58:58] pastimes that I enjoy to try to just get
[59:01] a reprieve from the world and the rat
[59:03] race and the struggle but let me say
[59:06] this my brother
[59:07] with every temptation with every
[59:09] struggle Satan will always give you the
[59:12] route out Satan will always give you
[59:16] with every tear every struggle that you
[59:18] go through and the pressure Satan will
[59:20] always give you a plan for exit settle
[59:25] for false peace and false hope money can
[59:28] be a false peace we realize the world
[59:31] thinks that all we need is to fix the
[59:33] debt and now we'll have peace friend
[59:35] that won't be no peace that doesn't
[59:38] produce peace the world's at calm look
[59:40] how fast how quickly China cheapens
[59:43] there they conned their money and boom
[59:45] just like that the stock market crashes
[59:47] and people are starting to talk about
[59:48] the depression or the the economic
[59:51] crisis of 2008 happened and again in
[59:53] September just when everyone started to
[59:57] breathe easy
[59:59] thinks are getting better finally things
[1:00:02] are getting better and then suddenly
[1:00:03] overnight just like that it's gone how
[1:00:11] quickly peace can leave we have the turn
[1:00:14] to be at peace to have peace with God
[1:00:17] but you also hear the term in the cliche
[1:00:20] many times use to be at peace with God
[1:00:23] we say it when a loved ones passing was
[1:00:25] they at peace with God are you at peace
[1:00:28] with God what does it mean to be at
[1:00:30] peace with God what does it mean when
[1:00:35] you can say there's nothing between my
[1:00:37] soul and my Savior oh my brother and my
[1:00:40] sister many people run from this
[1:00:42] question they run in their entire life
[1:00:45] that's why there's multi-million dollar
[1:00:47] industries who make millions of dollars
[1:00:49] a year on facial creams and skin creams
[1:00:53] and vitamins and pills trying so hard to
[1:00:56] push off death we try so hard to get
[1:01:03] away from that question we push it off
[1:01:05] and I watch so many people live their
[1:01:08] entire life seeking the best doctors to
[1:01:10] try to keep him alive you take the best
[1:01:12] millionaires even the man Steve Jobs who
[1:01:15] created Apple had the most money had
[1:01:17] more money than than they could buy the
[1:01:19] best doctor the best drugs the best
[1:01:21] procedures and it still didn't save him
[1:01:24] and all of his money he still went to a
[1:01:26] grave but people try to push off the
[1:01:31] question you say brother man is that ok
[1:01:33] do we do should we dwell on death and
[1:01:35] I'm not I'm not saying you should dwell
[1:01:36] on death or be morbid but listen friend
[1:01:39] you should have a healthy respect that
[1:01:41] your life is just a vapor and it could
[1:01:43] be gone tomorrow or tonight or in this
[1:01:46] service you have no idea what could
[1:01:48] happen you don't have no promise of
[1:01:50] tomorrow and I asked you the question it
[1:01:53] may seem simple but let me let up a
[1:01:55] preacher a simple preacher asked you are
[1:01:57] you at peace with God do you know Jesus
[1:02:02] oh Jesus is love but I say Jesus is
[1:02:06] peace it's the very characteristic of
[1:02:09] peace do you know him this morning in
[1:02:13] the power of his resurrection or have
[1:02:17] you pushed off that question so far out
[1:02:19] of your mind none of us wants to die
[1:02:20] listen friends some people are they they
[1:02:23] live their entire life and they die a
[1:02:24] scared person not knowing where they're
[1:02:27] gonna go when they take their last
[1:02:29] breath afraid of death afraid of the end
[1:02:33] what does the end mean even Christians
[1:02:37] can be I'm not saying that I mean it's
[1:02:39] natural all of us want to live death
[1:02:41] it's not part of God's plan it was the
[1:02:43] fall that brought forth death none of us
[1:02:46] want to die
[1:02:47] none of us you could be righteous as you
[1:02:50] want to be all right you know that he
[1:02:52] hates the day listen from there ain't
[1:02:54] one of you that wants to die this
[1:02:55] morning all of us love life
[1:03:00] we love life we love health and that's
[1:03:02] okay but it's an attribute of God but
[1:03:05] you should have a respect and a
[1:03:07] realization that your life is fleeting
[1:03:09] every single day your health is wasting
[1:03:11] away every day your but you get older
[1:03:14] every second you're fading you better
[1:03:19] answer the question why you still can do
[1:03:22] you know peace I'm not asking you if you
[1:03:27] know a Sunday School lesson are you u.s.
[1:03:29] had a mental agreement or a sent with a
[1:03:32] story about Jesus Oh my brother and my
[1:03:35] sister I'm asking you this morning ask
[1:03:38] yourself the question do you know him do
[1:03:42] you really know him oh you you you may
[1:03:46] not say a man and it may not be loud in
[1:03:48] here I don't mind at all I want to ask
[1:03:50] the question do you really know him do
[1:03:53] you really know him as your Savior have
[1:03:56] you really been buried with him in
[1:03:57] Baptism have you been regenerated into
[1:04:00] life have you died to your passion and
[1:04:02] your pride and been born again by the
[1:04:04] Spirit of God there's death a question
[1:04:10] that scares you Solomon writes and since
[1:04:13] I think it's a Ecclesiastes 3 Solomon
[1:04:16] says to everything there's a season to
[1:04:19] everything a time to give birth a time
[1:04:21] to be born a time to die a time to plan
[1:04:26] a time to pluck up that which is planted
[1:04:28] God appoints your birthday and he
[1:04:31] appoints your funeral if you are going
[1:04:33] to have a funeral it's all brother Matt
[1:04:36] we're all gonna go in a rapture yes we
[1:04:38] believe by faith but every generation
[1:04:40] before us believed they would go on a
[1:04:42] rapture and I believe there will be
[1:04:43] those who don't taste death
[1:04:45] and I believe I'm part of that number
[1:04:47] but I want to have a healthy respect to
[1:04:50] say if my life is gone and tomorrow is
[1:04:53] my in and is it clear between my soul
[1:04:56] and my Savior do I have that peace that
[1:05:02] passes understanding
[1:05:03] do I look at doors just a doorway that
[1:05:06] leads to another dimension the trouble
[1:05:11] so many times is that we fell
[1:05:13] number our days do you know David even
[1:05:16] prayed that David said then one of my
[1:05:18] favorite Psalms and and it's in Psalms
[1:05:21] chapter 90 David says Lord teach us to
[1:05:24] number our days that we may apply our
[1:05:29] hearts unto wisdom teach us to number
[1:05:33] our days that we may apply our hearts
[1:05:37] unto wisdom what is David meaning friend
[1:05:40] this one verse was one of the most
[1:05:43] powerful experiences I've ever had in
[1:05:45] God many many different times the Lord
[1:05:49] has came to me and spoke to me in
[1:05:51] powerful ways and services through
[1:05:53] tongues and prayer but never ever has it
[1:05:56] been this this magnificent if I could
[1:05:59] use that word of a time when I was
[1:06:01] laying it in in a in an in a basement in
[1:06:04] a preaching some meetings and in the
[1:06:06] middle of the night God woke me up out
[1:06:08] of nowhere three o'clock in the morning
[1:06:10] and inspired a verse I'd never even read
[1:06:13] begin to read my Bible and God began to
[1:06:15] bring before me the faces of my children
[1:06:17] and my wife and my family and my brother
[1:06:20] let me tell you I cried for hours until
[1:06:23] that morning I cried out to God because
[1:06:25] I realized that life is fading and
[1:06:28] flowers around you are quickly growing
[1:06:31] and fading what are you doing with your
[1:06:33] time are you spending your time and
[1:06:36] effortless and valueless pointless
[1:06:38] things or have you realized that the
[1:06:40] things that are most important and most
[1:06:42] valuable in life are quickly fading away
[1:06:45] and I prayed on my knees in that
[1:06:48] basement and said God teach me to number
[1:06:51] my days teach me that I may apply my
[1:06:54] heart unto wisdom let me live every day
[1:06:56] and make every day count
[1:07:01] some of us fathers and mothers and
[1:07:03] children and different ones I don't care
[1:07:05] who you are what level of life you are
[1:07:06] stop and slow down for just a moment
[1:07:10] Satan wants to put you on the rat race
[1:07:13] and the busyness of life and make you
[1:07:15] forget and you get 15 years down the
[1:07:17] road and you look back and say where did
[1:07:19] time go what a time go your children are
[1:07:24] only young once
[1:07:25] be a father to them when they need a
[1:07:27] father your sons and your daughters are
[1:07:30] only young once make sure you live and
[1:07:33] breathe every moment and make sure
[1:07:35] there's a testimony that they see a man
[1:07:37] of God and a woman of God who will stand
[1:07:40] with them and pray with them and plead
[1:07:41] with them not a dad who's always going
[1:07:45] and busy at work trying to pay trying to
[1:07:47] build the next new house or the next
[1:07:49] nicest thing not a mom who's so busy and
[1:07:51] caught up in Social Affairs that she
[1:07:53] misses the life of her children God told
[1:07:58] me to preach this and I'm gonna preach
[1:08:00] it David says teach us to number our
[1:08:08] days that we may gain a heart of wisdom
[1:08:15] heard it said that that a man who let me
[1:08:19] just find my place here a wise man once
[1:08:24] said the full spins his time but the
[1:08:28] wise and prudent invests his time the
[1:08:34] full spends his time but the wise and
[1:08:38] prudent invests his time it says also in
[1:08:43] Psalms 90 the days of our years are
[1:08:45] threescore years and ten if by reason of
[1:08:48] strength they may be fourscore years yet
[1:08:50] as their strength labor and sorrow for
[1:08:53] it is soon cut off and we fly away soon
[1:09:00] cut off how many people's lives have
[1:09:03] came to a premature in suddenly let me
[1:09:08] ask you something if God was to reveal
[1:09:10] to you that next week that your end and
[1:09:13] maybe your life is going to end friend
[1:09:15] we don't want to you we don't want to be
[1:09:17] morbid this morning but let's face
[1:09:19] reality here you don't have the promise
[1:09:21] of tonight or tomorrow David even asks
[1:09:26] that question and another place and
[1:09:29] ecclesia Aaron I'll read this first
[1:09:31] Ecclesiastes 7 - says it's better to go
[1:09:34] to the house of mourning than to go to a
[1:09:37] house of feasting
[1:09:39] for death is the destiny of everyone the
[1:09:42] living should take this to heart david
[1:09:46] says in Psalms 39 he asks a very honest
[1:09:49] question of the Lord show me Lord
[1:09:52] my life's end and the number of my days
[1:09:55] let me know how fleeting my life is
[1:10:02] could you be honest enough to ask that
[1:10:04] question this morning
[1:10:06] could we be honest enough to say as
[1:10:09] David said Lord show me the end of my
[1:10:11] day show me my life's in and the number
[1:10:14] of my days you say why would David even
[1:10:16] want to know this because David knows
[1:10:19] that that there's a spirit of rush and
[1:10:21] move and push and David says Lord I want
[1:10:24] to live and make sure how I make sure
[1:10:27] that I'm living every moment of my life
[1:10:29] and are not pushing to tomorrow and
[1:10:31] chasing dreams of tomorrow when I'm
[1:10:33] missing what's happening all around me
[1:10:38] David was a man who didn't want to live
[1:10:40] with regrets in his life as he looked
[1:10:42] back on years down the road had become
[1:10:44] an old man he wanted to look back on his
[1:10:46] life and know that he applied his heart
[1:10:48] unto wisdom that he made every day count
[1:10:51] that he wasn't spending wasted time and
[1:10:54] time and wasted things o friends I'm not
[1:10:57] saying that there's there's there that
[1:10:58] we that we that we don't do anything
[1:11:00] hobbies' or anything for recreation but
[1:11:02] my brother and my sister are you
[1:11:04] spending your time on what's really
[1:11:06] important think about it just for a
[1:11:08] moment how are we spending every day of
[1:11:12] our life are we spending it with the
[1:11:16] people that we love who God's placed in
[1:11:18] our life or are we neglecting our
[1:11:21] children oh I pay the bills I go to work
[1:11:25] I'm home aina James says life is a vapor
[1:11:37] life is just a vapor it's here today
[1:11:41] it's going tomorrow many people run from
[1:11:47] this question as we said many people
[1:11:49] push this question off because they have
[1:11:52] no
[1:11:52] peace with God they don't know him in
[1:11:55] the power of his resurrection and they
[1:11:56] live in every single day trying to push
[1:11:59] that question away from their mind you
[1:12:01] think and you're under the deception
[1:12:03] that Judas keep living and living and
[1:12:04] getting stronger and stronger but my
[1:12:06] brother my sister let me wake you up
[1:12:08] this morning is it this life is nothing
[1:12:11] more than a life full of troubles and
[1:12:13] sorrows they wait for tomorrow
[1:12:17] the only peace that you can find us in
[1:12:20] Jesus the only portion that you could
[1:12:22] find of joy it's not in this world and
[1:12:25] it's vain riches and it's vain saw
[1:12:28] recreation and entertainment all those
[1:12:30] things are a false deception they're a
[1:12:32] false hope and a false peace but Jesus
[1:12:35] in Jesus there's peace in Christ there's
[1:12:38] Thanksgiving in peace the only real
[1:12:42] peace that we'll have in this world is
[1:12:44] not when we get a the next president or
[1:12:46] some Republican or Democrat or or
[1:12:49] something listen friend all those things
[1:12:51] are just a system waiting to fail the
[1:12:53] only piece will be the peace when God
[1:12:55] sets up his kingdom and I say Lord
[1:13:00] hasten the day it's the only piece and
[1:13:04] reprieve for the believer oh the kind of
[1:13:07] worldly peace people have settled for
[1:13:09] you can get it for you good as we said
[1:13:12] it can be produced by drugs or alcohol
[1:13:14] calm peace tranquility and well-being
[1:13:17] produced when you maybe you get an
[1:13:19] inheritance of some money and then you
[1:13:20] get a sense of peace I guess what it can
[1:13:23] all fade just like that that's not the
[1:13:27] kind of peace Paul has in mind when Paul
[1:13:29] says I pray the God of peace grant you
[1:13:32] peace every day listen friend the peace
[1:13:34] that I'm speaking of is not the peace
[1:13:37] that can be induced or fabricated by
[1:13:39] money or by drugs the peace that Jesus
[1:13:42] said I leave with you is a piece that's
[1:13:44] not just about how things are going good
[1:13:47] but Jesus says my peace is a
[1:13:49] supernatural anointing that every
[1:13:52] believer has a right to that when you're
[1:13:54] in the middle of the belly of the
[1:13:56] there can be a peace that passes
[1:13:57] understanding oh when you're in the
[1:14:00] middle of the fiery furnace and the
[1:14:03] fires been turned up seven times more
[1:14:05] hotter there's a fourth man in the
[1:14:07] middle of your fire who will be with you
[1:14:10] oh the kind of peace that were preaching
[1:14:14] about is the kind of peace that P that
[1:14:16] Stephen had when the Bible says he was
[1:14:19] being stoned and the Bible says that his
[1:14:22] rocks were being slung upon him peace
[1:14:24] Stephen has such a peace he says Lord
[1:14:27] forgive them and receive my spirit you
[1:14:33] see this is the kind of godly peace that
[1:14:35] God gives it's a peace that the Bible
[1:14:37] says in Philippians transcends your
[1:14:39] human understanding you say what does
[1:14:42] that mean brother Matt what is the peace
[1:14:44] God gives the peace God gives is a
[1:14:47] supernatural peace that you can say
[1:14:49] though he slay me yet I'll trust him
[1:14:51] the Lord God giveth and the Lord God
[1:14:53] taketh away it is the peace that the
[1:14:58] three Hebrew boys had when they said
[1:15:00] listen our God is more than able to
[1:15:03] deliver us from this fiery furnace our
[1:15:05] God whom we serve what was it nikka
[1:15:08] Nebuchadnezzar in the face of
[1:15:10] threatening and intimidation they had a
[1:15:13] calm since about him that they knew my
[1:15:15] God is more than able he's more than
[1:15:18] able to deliver me from the fiery
[1:15:19] furnace it was a peace of God that I'm
[1:15:22] speaking up to you this morning what was
[1:15:24] it it was a supernatural anointing that
[1:15:27] anointed these men that in the face of
[1:15:29] danger and in the face of trouble and
[1:15:31] the face of trial they could still have
[1:15:33] a sense of calm about them they could
[1:15:38] say our God whom we serve is more than
[1:15:40] able to deliver us out of the fiery
[1:15:43] furnace is that your testimony today
[1:15:45] just say the God whom I serve I'm not
[1:15:48] looking at the circumstance I'm not
[1:15:50] looking at the fiery furnace I'm looking
[1:15:52] at a promise in God's Word and the God
[1:15:55] whom I serve is more than able to
[1:15:57] deliver me oh but a drug could have
[1:16:01] produced that kind of faith let's go
[1:16:03] further they said even if our God does
[1:16:06] not deliver us
[1:16:08] is that what they said they said listen
[1:16:11] Nebuchadnezzar make it known unto you
[1:16:14] that even if we perish in that fire we
[1:16:17] still won't bow hallelujah Oh glory to
[1:16:25] God they said even if we perish in the
[1:16:28] midst of a fiery furnace we still won't
[1:16:31] bow what was it they had a piece the
[1:16:34] past human understanding it was the same
[1:16:39] piece that Jesus had when it came before
[1:16:41] Pilate and Pilate said there was such a
[1:16:44] calm about him he said don't you know I
[1:16:46] have the power to give you life or to
[1:16:49] give you death and Jesus said because he
[1:16:51] had a piece down inside of his soul
[1:16:53] jesus said you have no power over me but
[1:16:56] what my father in heaven gives you this
[1:17:00] angered Pilate because he never spoke a
[1:17:02] word the Bible says he either not a word
[1:17:04] what was it he possessed the peace that
[1:17:07] passes understanding our friend is that
[1:17:09] the kind of peace that you won't this
[1:17:11] morning I said is that the kind of piece
[1:17:13] that you want this morning to say God
[1:17:16] don't give me a piece of the world that
[1:17:17] can fade and crumble and shatter at a
[1:17:20] moment's notice
[1:17:21] give me the peace that when I'm in the
[1:17:22] middle of the fiery furnace when I'm
[1:17:24] going through and struggling I can't
[1:17:26] understand what's happening yet I'll
[1:17:28] still praise you yet I'll still worship
[1:17:31] you oh you could serve God and you can
[1:17:33] worship God when the goings good but can
[1:17:36] you today this morning raised the hand
[1:17:38] to God and say I'll serve you and I'll
[1:17:41] praise you no matter what I'm going
[1:17:43] through
[1:17:43] oh my brother the kind of peace were
[1:17:48] preaching on this morning is the piece
[1:17:50] that says Paul and Silas had in the
[1:17:53] prison the Bible says that when they
[1:17:54] were arrested notice arrested for
[1:17:57] delivering a young woman of a spirit and
[1:17:59] now they're arrested bond bound in
[1:18:01] fetters and chains could you imagine
[1:18:03] these men after you imagine after
[1:18:06] preaching a sermon today what would you
[1:18:08] think of me after after I preached this
[1:18:09] sermon today you walked out in the
[1:18:11] parking lot and there were sheriff's
[1:18:12] deputies they stripped me naked of my
[1:18:14] clothes and beat me and fought me
[1:18:16] arrested me and took me to prison
[1:18:19] some of you'd say hmm not sure about
[1:18:23] that guy he must have been a secret
[1:18:25] sinner must have had sin in his life
[1:18:28] somewhere hello somebody
[1:18:33] this was the story of brother Paul and
[1:18:35] brother Silas right coming out of a
[1:18:37] deliverance service they're arrested
[1:18:39] deep fog strip naked put in a prison if
[1:18:43] anybody would have had an excuse to be
[1:18:46] depressed if anybody would have had an
[1:18:48] excuse to be downtrodden and downcast
[1:18:50] his brother Jules says wowsie wowsie
[1:18:53] whoo
[1:18:54] if anybody had a reason to come to
[1:18:56] church and fold their arms and sit there
[1:18:59] and not worship and not say Amen it was
[1:19:01] brother Paul and brother Silas but my
[1:19:04] Bible tells me that in the midst of the
[1:19:06] prison they began to sing songs and
[1:19:09] praise to God in the midst of their
[1:19:14] chains in the midst of their blood and
[1:19:16] torment and beating had begun to sing my
[1:19:19] god ray
[1:19:23] hi God rains could you imagine the other
[1:19:30] prisoners do you hear that
[1:19:33] hey hey John weren't these the guys that
[1:19:36] were just beat out there and the crowd
[1:19:38] was screaming the soldiers what are they
[1:19:40] singing our God is an awesome God he
[1:19:44] reigns from heaven above with we some
[1:19:51] power and love our God is an awesome God
[1:19:57] did you hear don t hear that song coming
[1:20:00] from over there
[1:20:01] I think I hear it is that those same
[1:20:03] boys as Paul began to sing and a silent
[1:20:06] big silence begin to worship he's in the
[1:20:09] house death has to flee now there is
[1:20:15] life where darkness used to be you mean
[1:20:21] the same men that were just flogged and
[1:20:23] beaten stripped naked or singing and
[1:20:25] worshipping and suddenly the Bible says
[1:20:28] that the prison begins to shake and the
[1:20:31] earth begin to shake what was it they
[1:20:33] had a piece that passed understanding it
[1:20:36] was an anointing that came upon their
[1:20:38] soul and in the middle of their hell
[1:20:40] they began to worship they begin to sing
[1:20:43] I bless your name I bless your name the
[1:20:51] Bible says that the earth begin to
[1:20:53] tremble and the prison begin to shake
[1:20:55] and you imagine these men as the
[1:20:57] soldiers watch these two men in the
[1:20:59] middle of their trial in the middle of
[1:21:01] their desperation oh my friend can you
[1:21:03] worship Him this morning in the middle
[1:21:06] of your hell in the middle of the
[1:21:08] dungeon of your life can you raise your
[1:21:10] hands this morning and say god I worship
[1:21:13] you in the
[1:21:14] of my dungeon in the middle of my hell
[1:21:17] and the belly of the well oh you ought
[1:21:22] to worship him more than that this
[1:21:24] morning friend you are to give him the
[1:21:26] praise that's to his name to say God no
[1:21:28] matter how I feel no matter what the
[1:21:30] situation looks like you're worthy of my
[1:21:33] praise the Bible says that as they begin
[1:21:37] to sing their chains fell off as they
[1:21:42] begin to worship in the middle of their
[1:21:44] hell the prison cells begin to break
[1:21:46] open and guess what they went free
[1:21:50] they went free but guess what Paul and
[1:21:54] Silas wasn't the only ones who went free
[1:21:55] that day the Bible says every prisoner
[1:21:59] that was bound went free I guess you
[1:22:04] didn't hear me I said every prisoner
[1:22:06] that was found went free every person
[1:22:10] that was found went free oh don't you
[1:22:13] realize when you can get victory and
[1:22:15] praising when you don't feel like
[1:22:17] praising him and when you feel cold and
[1:22:19] stagnant and stale but you begin to
[1:22:21] raise your hands for God and give him a
[1:22:24] wave offering and say Lord no matter the
[1:22:27] circumstance no matter the trial our
[1:22:29] worship you the Bible says every person
[1:22:31] who is bound when free oh that we can
[1:22:35] have that kind of a deterred service
[1:22:36] this morning every person bound by
[1:22:40] nicotine went free every person down by
[1:22:43] alcohol with free every person bound by
[1:22:45] pornography went free every person bound
[1:22:48] at freedom that day I'll give him a
[1:22:51] praise offering this morning friends
[1:22:55] worried to Jesus it was a piece that
[1:23:02] passed understanding you see this is the
[1:23:05] piece that Jesus says I leave with you
[1:23:07] my peace I give you not as the world
[1:23:11] gives my peace Lord I want your peace I
[1:23:16] want your peace when I'm in the belly of
[1:23:20] a well and it doesn't make sense and I
[1:23:23] can't make sense of what's happening I
[1:23:25] want to praise you even then Lord when I
[1:23:28] have to go into a fiery furnace and it
[1:23:30] seems like death is near Lord I want to
[1:23:33] praise you even then because I know that
[1:23:35] in the midst it wasn't until they begin
[1:23:38] to praise him oh don't miss it it was
[1:23:40] not until they worshiped him in the
[1:23:42] middle of their pain that the fourth man
[1:23:44] appeared it wasn't til they began to
[1:23:48] praise him in the midst of their change
[1:23:50] that the earth began to shake peace that
[1:23:59] passes understanding this is where David
[1:24:03] finds himself in 1st Samuel 30 we see
[1:24:06] such a hard time for brother David as we
[1:24:08] get back to our text this morning as we
[1:24:10] read David comes to Ziklag and first
[1:24:12] Samuel 30 if you have your Bible just
[1:24:14] turn there with me we'll read it one
[1:24:16] more time he comes to this city and no
[1:24:19] doubt he's coming from victory David is
[1:24:22] not expecting what's about to happen he
[1:24:25] had he thinks everything's going to be
[1:24:27] fine when he comes home he's been
[1:24:29] anointed king he settled in Ziklag but
[1:24:32] the Bible tells us that when his men
[1:24:34] were come to Ziklag on the third day the
[1:24:36] Amalekites had invaded the south in
[1:24:38] Ziklag and smitten Ziklag and burned it
[1:24:41] with fire and had taken the women
[1:24:43] captive that were there in they slew not
[1:24:46] any either great or small but carried
[1:24:48] them away and went on their way what a
[1:24:50] shock that brother David had when he
[1:24:53] comes home now sick lag as we said as
[1:24:56] history teaches us sir the Bible tells
[1:24:59] us that the history of it that he comes
[1:25:01] and he settles for this city sick lang
[1:25:03] and now David didn't realize but sick
[1:25:06] lag is going to cost
[1:25:07] you david Ziklag is gonna cost you your
[1:25:10] wife your family your sons your
[1:25:13] daughters oh but it was just reprieve it
[1:25:17] was just relief I was just doing it to
[1:25:20] catch a break but it's gonna cost it's
[1:25:27] gonna cost you David I remember the
[1:25:30] story of Jacob said Jacob when he goes
[1:25:32] to Shechem and David loses his daughter
[1:25:35] - she sees violated and took by one of
[1:25:39] the one of the men of Shechem the Jacob
[1:25:43] had no clue that as he win instead of
[1:25:45] going back and worshiping God
[1:25:47] David guard Jacob goes and now it cost
[1:25:50] him his own daughter do you realise
[1:25:51] sometimes the choices that we make what
[1:25:55] they cost us David comes to Ziklag and
[1:26:01] he pulls up and he sees as they come
[1:26:03] from 50-mile journey three days and men
[1:26:07] are tired from weary from war want to
[1:26:10] come home to maybe a nice hot meal see
[1:26:13] their wife their children come run and
[1:26:15] embrace in their arms here they're
[1:26:17] fighting for this man David David thinks
[1:26:19] he's in the will of God until he presses
[1:26:23] clearly comes upon the crest of that
[1:26:24] last hill and they looked at him and
[1:26:27] smokes billowing from Ziklag imagine the
[1:26:33] distraught filling in the depression
[1:26:35] that suddenly settles in is they begin
[1:26:37] to look and the men begin to run through
[1:26:39] the city looking calling for their
[1:26:41] children call him for their wife
[1:26:43] nobody's home everybody's gone there's
[1:26:46] not even a there's not even they took
[1:26:48] all the sheep all the ox and all the
[1:26:50] goats they took though the women the
[1:26:52] children everything David comes to an
[1:26:58] end of himself as we read last night in
[1:27:03] Psalms 38 David begins to say this
[1:27:05] prayer is this struggle he had within
[1:27:07] him David begins to become discouraged
[1:27:11] I could imagine he was discouraged as
[1:27:13] the easy thinks everything was just
[1:27:16] going to script everything was going as
[1:27:18] planned
[1:27:19] but now his wife has captured as
[1:27:21] children are gone David begins to become
[1:27:24] greatly distressed and troubled and the
[1:27:28] Bible says that the men begin to speak
[1:27:30] of stoning him
[1:27:31] could you imagine here these same men
[1:27:34] that were fighting with him that were
[1:27:36] standing by a side just a few days ago
[1:27:39] in battle
[1:27:41] now David hears the murmuring it's all
[1:27:44] his fault
[1:27:46] have we not listened to Hillman went
[1:27:49] over we wouldn't be in this mess now
[1:27:50] look you imagine the my battles that
[1:27:52] these men were having they begin to
[1:27:54] wonder about their kids and their family
[1:27:56] for all they know they're dead you'd
[1:28:01] want to blame somebody David can ask the
[1:28:10] question is this how the righteous are
[1:28:12] rewarded Lord what have I done what have
[1:28:18] I done now my wife and children and home
[1:28:21] and family burned and gone and now even
[1:28:25] my own men my own friends no one's there
[1:28:29] to come for him no one's there to
[1:28:31] encourage him no one's there to pray for
[1:28:34] him or to say it's okay David oh and
[1:28:37] David's remembering no doubt Samuel
[1:28:40] anoint him as King and Samuel pour in
[1:28:43] the anointing oil upon his head and now
[1:28:45] it doesn't make sense he sees the
[1:28:47] promise he remembers the promise but he
[1:28:49] looks at life and reality and there's a
[1:28:52] problem there because the promise and
[1:28:54] the reality are not lining up at all he
[1:29:00] knew he was called specially chosen to
[1:29:03] take the throne he knew the crown would
[1:29:05] eventually be his David had a visitation
[1:29:08] from God he spoke with God he pleaded
[1:29:11] with God he would sell us for God and
[1:29:14] now that can come over as he stands
[1:29:16] there upon this burning ruin of his life
[1:29:19] and David's looking at all his mess not
[1:29:22] knowing if his family was dead or alive
[1:29:24] the torment of his mind he's thinking
[1:29:28] act after everything that he's went
[1:29:30] through in all the struggles in trouble
[1:29:33] we went through after finally finding a
[1:29:37] home after finally having some peace for
[1:29:41] a year and four months he didn't know
[1:29:43] though David it was false peace you
[1:29:47] think you've gotten peace because you've
[1:29:49] neglected the Word of God or neglected
[1:29:51] the plan of God took a job that you knew
[1:29:53] you weren't supposed to take took you
[1:29:54] out of church took your family out of
[1:29:56] church took you away from your home
[1:29:58] church but you got money oh but I got
[1:30:03] money no trouble oh brother it's false
[1:30:05] peace finally he gets some reprieve
[1:30:10] finally he gets some peace finally
[1:30:12] things are settled and calm it's all
[1:30:15] gonna be okay but don't you realize
[1:30:17] David to hold sick leg you're gonna have
[1:30:19] to fight with your hands you're gonna
[1:30:21] have to fight and keep everything you
[1:30:23] got you're gonna have to do it all
[1:30:25] yourself when God wants to give you a
[1:30:27] kingdom that cannot be shaken God wants
[1:30:30] to give you a kingdom to where he'll
[1:30:32] fight your battles but you've settled
[1:30:34] and tuned out of your own hands the city
[1:30:37] are you with me here this morning and
[1:30:42] all this false peace begins to settle in
[1:30:46] upon David and he realized now us here
[1:30:53] can read the Bible and we have the
[1:30:56] privilege of reading the end of the
[1:30:58] story and we could say this morning even
[1:31:04] though David didn't know it God was
[1:31:06] right in the smack dab middle of this
[1:31:09] tragedy God was right in the thick of it
[1:31:14] God was trying to teach David a lesson
[1:31:16] God was trying to bring David to
[1:31:18] something my brother David had no idea
[1:31:21] brother do you realize sometimes when
[1:31:24] you think God's forsaken you and God's
[1:31:26] forgotten about you and you can't see
[1:31:28] God in any of it
[1:31:29] God is right in the middle of it he's
[1:31:32] right in the middle of that night of
[1:31:34] lonely pleading prayer and
[1:31:36] fake all's been lost and Oscar gone but
[1:31:38] just remember joy comes in the morning
[1:31:42] David had no clue that God was in
[1:31:45] control of everything and my brother my
[1:31:48] sister that's exactly what the peace of
[1:31:50] God gives you it gives you a peace to
[1:31:52] know God has it all in control I may not
[1:31:56] understand it but I believe God has the
[1:31:59] situation in control because he is peace
[1:32:03] he is the author of peace let me tell
[1:32:05] you my brother he is the author of peace
[1:32:08] he is peace himself peace is not an
[1:32:11] attribute of God peace is God oh can I
[1:32:17] preach to you just here for a moment
[1:32:19] I said peace is God it's not just an
[1:32:22] attribute of God peace is God he is
[1:32:26] peace there is no lack of perfect peace
[1:32:30] in the beam of God at all times God has
[1:32:33] perfect peace
[1:32:34] he has never troubled by anything he
[1:32:37] never struggles with anxiety and
[1:32:39] pressure over anything let me tell you
[1:32:42] God never worries for one second he
[1:32:47] never doubts God never fears he's never
[1:32:50] in discord with his own self or his own
[1:32:53] will he's omniscient he's all-knowing
[1:32:56] Satan is not a mission and all-knowing
[1:32:59] don't you forget that Satan cannot be
[1:33:02] everyplace everywhere all the time but
[1:33:05] my God whom I serve can be everyplace
[1:33:08] everywhere every time in my life he's
[1:33:14] never in a cross with himself God has
[1:33:16] never unclear about what he wants he's
[1:33:19] never unsure about what he thinks God
[1:33:23] has never threatened in God is a perfect
[1:33:28] calm in God His perfect tranquility in
[1:33:34] God His perfect control why because God
[1:33:38] knows he's in charge of everything and
[1:33:41] everything that happens he's operating
[1:33:43] everything
[1:33:44] both good and both bad everything is
[1:33:48] according to his own will or exactly
[1:33:50] Holly wants it at all times
[1:33:53] there's nothing ever in the entire
[1:33:55] universe that catches God off guard
[1:33:58] oh can I preach about God here just for
[1:34:02] a moment
[1:34:02] there's nothing ever out of keiter he's
[1:34:05] never surprised by anything there are
[1:34:08] never no sense of unknown or unaware to
[1:34:11] God he never changes he never doubts he
[1:34:15] never fears his wrath even his wrath is
[1:34:18] perfectly controlled he's not an angry
[1:34:23] God who just gets angry and slapped
[1:34:24] somebody his wrath is even perfectly
[1:34:27] controlled and orchestrated he is
[1:34:29] perfect in every way and let me tell you
[1:34:32] that same God made a promise the piece
[1:34:35] that I have living inside of me I give

[1:34:55] him that His grace can't save I don't
[1:35:00] care how much in sin or bounds your
[1:35:02] loved one is or your friend or your
[1:35:04] family I don't care how bound it seems
[1:35:06] there is no sinner that can stand before
[1:35:08] the grace of Jesus but God can't save
[1:35:13] there's no possible sin that can sustain
[1:35:16] his holiness he is perfect in every way
[1:35:19] there's no guilt in his mind there's no
[1:35:23] shame in his mind there's no
[1:35:25] condemnation in his spirit he is perfect
[1:35:28] in peace there's no regret in his mind
[1:35:31] or his person he's never said anything
[1:35:33] that he didn't mean he's never done
[1:35:35] anything that he has to take back and
[1:35:37] this same person by the Spirit of God is
[1:35:40] living inside of you my brother and my
[1:35:43] sister that same God who's perfect in
[1:35:45] every way oh can you rejoice with me
[1:35:48] this morning that same God who's perfect
[1:35:51] and
[1:35:51] lives inside of his family he enjoys
[1:35:58] perfect harmony with himself he is peace
[1:36:07] that's why the Bible calls him the Lord
[1:36:10] of peace
[1:36:11] I want that Lord of peace to rule over I
[1:36:15] said I want that peace of God to rule
[1:36:18] over my life I want that peace just to
[1:36:21] cover me and enshroud my family oh I
[1:36:23] want you to take that situation in your
[1:36:25] home or your marriage or your family or
[1:36:27] your church raise your hand and say
[1:36:29] peace of God would you cover me this
[1:36:31] morning peace of God only whom there's
[1:36:34] no variableness or a shadow of turning
[1:36:35] would you cover me may the God of peace
[1:36:42] and I'll comfort David comes and the
[1:36:47] Bible says as we read it the Bible says
[1:36:49] he comes to this moment little does
[1:36:52] David know God's right in the thick of
[1:36:53] it and David hears the murmurs and the
[1:36:58] complaining
[1:37:07] imagine as he's watching what do I do
[1:37:13] if there was ever a man who should have
[1:37:19] folded and crumbled under pressure could
[1:37:25] you imagine if you were responsible you
[1:37:31] were responsible for all these soldiers
[1:37:34] who fall for you and now you're the one
[1:37:37] to blame for their deaths and their
[1:37:39] families and their wives and their
[1:37:41] children imagine the guilt his David
[1:37:46] begins to hear the whispers wish its
[1:37:50] toning that begin to blame him
[1:37:53] begin to blame him for everything that's
[1:37:55] happened
[1:37:56] I can't imagine David 600 men bows
[1:38:04] swords scattered on the earth
[1:38:07] shields lay him down takes a lot to make
[1:38:11] a man cry but let him lose his family
[1:38:14] it'll break that man to his inner core
[1:38:20] soldiers men who were callused from
[1:38:24] battle now those same strong warriors
[1:38:28] weeping the Bible says they cried and
[1:38:32] wept until they had no more tears to cry
[1:38:39] and here's David in the second middle of
[1:38:41] it as they cried and cried and cried I
[1:38:45] can see soldiers on their knees at their
[1:38:49] homes
[1:38:49] picking up maybe tarnished pieces and
[1:38:52] memory something burnt of one of the
[1:38:54] homes and they've seen something of a
[1:38:56] one of their possessions of their wife
[1:38:57] or their children you can imagine as
[1:39:00] their their hearts begin to crack and
[1:39:02] bleed they begin to be under such
[1:39:04] torment and now David himself all of the
[1:39:07] attention focuses on David and now
[1:39:10] everything is coming back to his mind
[1:39:12] and I can guarantee you the question
[1:39:14] he's asking is why Ziklag
[1:39:15] why did I do
[1:39:17] why didn't I just stay on the front line
[1:39:19] why didn't I just stay the pressure was
[1:39:21] hard but this is much harder to bear
[1:39:24] imagine the guilt of his own decision
[1:39:26] when he came but I can see brother David
[1:39:29] as the men are weeping and wailing and
[1:39:31] sort crying and everyone's crying and
[1:39:34] pleading out to God cursing and blaming
[1:39:37] David it's all your fault David my wife
[1:39:42] is gone it's all your fault listen my
[1:39:44] brother this was not there was nowhere
[1:39:46] that David could find encouragement
[1:39:49] there was nobody who was gonna give him
[1:39:52] a hug you know an encouraging word there
[1:39:54] was no child to hold his hand
[1:39:56] there was no Jonathan to encourage him
[1:39:58] he was all by himself but I could see
[1:40:04] David all by himself
[1:40:08] sitting over there tears streaming down
[1:40:12] his face but then suddenly David
[1:40:17] something deep we don't only inside the
[1:40:21] prophet of God said hey not my baby Lord
[1:40:24] if you take my baby I won't even serve
[1:40:25] you he said it's something down on the
[1:40:28] inside of me grabbed ahold of me and he
[1:40:31] said something I didn't even know was
[1:40:32] there he said grabbed a hold of me and
[1:40:34] held me I imagine that something from
[1:40:36] David has he's crying and weeping I can
[1:40:39] imagine David sits there in the dust and
[1:40:41] dirt as his tears begin to stream from
[1:40:44] his face and David can't find
[1:40:46] encouragement from any brother he can't
[1:40:48] find encouragement from any sister he
[1:40:52] can't find encouragement from his pastor
[1:40:53] he can't find encouragement from a
[1:40:55] brother he can't find encouragement in
[1:40:58] anybody but the Bible says he encouraged
[1:41:01] himself in the Lord he began to
[1:41:05] encourage himself in God oh brother
[1:41:10] don't you realize sometimes God doesn't
[1:41:12] want you to draw from the well of your
[1:41:14] brother or your sister or your pastor or
[1:41:16] a preacher but God wants you to come to
[1:41:18] the revelation there's a well down on
[1:41:21] the inside of you there's our
[1:41:23] living water a river of life down on the
[1:41:26] inside of you all you've got to do is
[1:41:28] draw from the well that God's put inside
[1:41:31] of you
[1:41:34] David begins to cry but David's voice
[1:41:37] under his voice I can hear him begin to
[1:41:40] mumble in my distress I cry unto the
[1:41:44] Lord I cried to my god for help and he
[1:41:47] heard me
[1:41:48] I can hear David begin to mumble under
[1:41:51] his breath I will magnify the Lord at
[1:41:54] all times I will greatly lift his name
[1:41:56] and all times whole but David what about
[1:41:59] your family what about your children I
[1:42:01] will magnify the Lord let everything
[1:42:04] that hath breath praise ye the Lord let
[1:42:07] everything that's within me praise the
[1:42:09] Lord let everything in my spirit praise
[1:42:12] the Lord
[1:42:13] I can imagine as David begin to get
[1:42:15] anointed David said his praise will
[1:42:18] continually be from my mouth I will
[1:42:23] magnify the Lord at all times don't you
[1:42:27] realize brother sometimes that's what we
[1:42:29] need to do don't put a magnifying glass
[1:42:32] on your problem put a magnifying glass
[1:42:35] on your God put a magnifying glass on
[1:42:38] his promises don't let the devil blow up
[1:42:41] your problems put a magnifying glass on
[1:42:43] the scripture that says I will never
[1:42:46] leave you nor forsake you to the end of
[1:42:48] the world I'll be a God of comfort and
[1:42:51] peace and help in the time of need I can
[1:42:57] imagine David's same glorify the Lord
[1:43:00] with me let us exalt his name together I
[1:43:04] saw the Lord and he answered me he
[1:43:07] delivered me from all my fears those who
[1:43:09] look at me in a radiant their faces are
[1:43:11] now never covered with shame this poor
[1:43:13] man called and the Lord heard him that's
[1:43:18] the words of David this poor man cried
[1:43:20] unto God and the God of heaven heard
[1:43:23] this poor man's try
[1:43:26] I waited patiently for the Lord and he
[1:43:30] turned to me and heard me cry as the
[1:43:32] deer panteth after the water Brooks so
[1:43:35] my soul panted after thee O God I will
[1:43:40] look to the hills from whence cometh my
[1:43:42] help where does my help come from the
[1:43:46] Bible says he encouraged himself in the
[1:43:49] Lord I could imagine as the songs began
[1:43:53] to rise from his body from his mouth as
[1:43:56] he began to say many are they increased
[1:43:58] that trouble me many there be that say
[1:44:01] of my soul there's no help for you in
[1:44:03] God's a law but I say that's what the
[1:44:05] devil says that's what the enemy says
[1:44:08] but here's what I say thou Lord are a
[1:44:11] shield for me
[1:44:12] you're the glory and the lifter up of my
[1:44:15] head hallelujah I can imagine David's
[1:44:20] voice beginning to get louder as the
[1:44:22] anointing begin to encourage him and
[1:44:24] David says give me an ephod and David
[1:44:26] takes the ephod and asks God shall I
[1:44:28] pursue or shall I overtake and God says
[1:44:31] David because you can encourage yourself
[1:44:33] in the Lord
[1:44:34] here's the word of the Lord from you and
[1:44:36] my brother and my sister when I studied
