Father praise the Lord I'm sure we can all say that tonight he's been so faithful and so true to each of us greet you tonight in the name of the Lord trust you're doing well happy to be able to be gathered together again tonight amen let's start um with a question shall we I know that God can hear our thoughts but I've been wondering if he hears all of our thoughts and if we are held accountable for any bad thoughts I wonder if is anybody here that's had any bad thoughts this week W so this question apparently applies to all of us don't it well let's read a a couple of scriptures and then we'll we'll pray and then you can be seated Matthew 15:18 but those things which prede out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile a man and Jesus is answering what the scribes the Pharisees had ask him about eating contaminated Foods so they had a levitical law they could eat certain types of food certain types they couldn't so they were trying to criticize Jesus and his disciples and he was bringing them a point that it's not so much what went in them as far as food that contaminated them but it's actually what came out and he's showing them the source of where it's coming from in verse 19 he says out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness and blasphemies so out of the heart of an unconverted person comes all of these things 2 Corinthians chapter 10:5 but then Paul turns around now as Christians he says casting down imaginations and every High say that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ it's about together Lord Jesus we thank you for this opportunity that we can be gathered together again tonight Lord to be able to try our best to answer questions that are on the hearts of these young people things that are troubling them things that they are concerned about is this right or is this wrong and Lord we saw from the hands that were uplifted by this one question that it affects every one of us so we pray tonight that you would would help us speak through me Lord to be able to help them in this battle that they're in we pray tonight father in Jesus name amen you can be seated once of course that we're born again and we received the Holy Ghost and we are a new creature in Christ Jesus but we know that our mind is not converted your intelligence your brain it's referred to in the the New Testament as well as the old and they would call it the heart we know it's not so much this muscle here that's beating the blood and passing it through our body but it was what they considered to be the soul or that which was tied to the conscience realm of knowing right and wrong and this question let me read it to you again I know that God can hear our thoughts but I've been wondering if he hears all of our thoughts and we are held accountable for for any bad thoughts now most of you raise your hand whenever I ask you how many of you had had bad thoughts this week and you saw most of mind more up so how can that be how can a child of God a Christian that loves the Lord Jesus have thoughts that would be embarrassing I would imagine every one of us if we'd be honest here tonight that we have had thoughts even about God that you wouldn't want nobody to know that you had is there a God how do you knows there a god is he real all that sort of thing anybody brave enough just wiggle your finger okay God bless you sis God bless you all most of you then okay well guess what as your pastor so have I and because of the part inside of us that is not redeemed I love the way that brother brandom when he goes siding with this and he he makes it very clear to us um in the greatest battle ever fall that there there's a mutual ground a No Man's Land he called it and they fight there at this place notice the title of his sermon the greatest battle ever fought so there had to be a place that would be chosen in the beginning to where that this war would transpire between good and evil once it was brought down from the Heavens to the Earth he said they just don't one fight over here and one down here one right over there but there's a battle front where they meet and test their powers now we know that so even in the natural that there has to be a battlefield that is chosen Napoleon met his fate at waterl we know the wars between the North and the South and we could go through different places by which that the north one here and the South one there and World War I World War II so there is a mutual place we know what's going on now between Israel and and uh Hamas and it's going on between Russia and Ukraine so there is a place that is chosen and it's not really a Battleground if there's only one side that is there so there must be a mutual place that is chosen and both sides in this case God and the devil God and the devil agree on this Mutual place by which the war for man's soul will rage and that place is your mind now when we're lost of course Satan has our soul then our soul our spirit and our body is in complete harmony with what he wants us to do then after we're born again you're talking about a mess we become a real mess because our soul is born from Heaven actually when Jesus said that to Nicodemus and he said you must be born again and the Greek words actually or you must be born from above now before that happened to you your soul was lost your spirit was lost your body was lost your soul was in darkness your spirit was in darkness your body was in darkness so at least you had a Harmony even though it was a warped Harmony but we did have Harmony was all lost all three of us Soul spirit and body then when God transforms us and performs this miracle inside of us then this war really starts because there's a part of us that is of heaven born from Heaven A Heavenly origin Heavenly attributes but then it leaves the spirit which is still unregenerated leaves the flesh which is still unregenerated and as Paul would refer to it the carnal mind so where then is God going to choose the battle it's his call not the devil's it's God's call so God shows the mind before Man actually ever even fail in the Garden of Eden now notice he says there's a Battlefront where they meet and test their powers now if we would be able to go and I've been to different battlefields been in Europe and different parts of the world and Africa and the United States and and see some of the different battlefields maybe many of you traveled and then have to do likewise and in those places there would be such bombardments of cannons and there would be such destruction and such Devastation for those of you that have went to the Civil War battlefields and you've seen antium and Gettysburg and you've been um to Mississippi and you've seen the encampments there before you cross the Mississippi River going into Louisiana and you see and oh now it's beautiful you see you know you see certain monuments that are erected there you come into Chattanooga and you see where the first core of Georgia was at and you can see where the second Gore of Illinois was at and you can see all that but you don't see what it was R like in that day you don't see all the holes that were in the ground the pit the pit bits and pieces of broken bones of humans bodies that was laying everywhere arms and and legs and and the upper torso of body and the bottom part of the body was blown away and blood and it it would be sickening for us to be able to look look at it that's the real Battleground but when man gets done with it man goes over it he manicures it sews it down in beautiful grass and he decorates it and he puts concrete statues or granite or marble or whatever they are and then man turns it into a mum or he turns it into a memorial but that's not really what the battlefield look like if we could go back to those battlefields and we would hear in the dead of the night men screaming somebody help me please help me a leg blowed off blood pouring out of their body maybe shot on the side of their head with an ear missing and it would have been horrific it's terrible for me to even describe it to you and the reason I do that is so you'll be able to catch the impact of what your mind is now take from that from a natural setting of a battlefield and think that that's what our minds are today as a children of God so both both God and Satan test their powers in this battlefield so how would it be in a war so Napoleon would shoot their cannons and the other side would shoot theirs and the Civil War the north would shoot and the South would shoot in Russia they're doing it um today in the modern day battlefield of course totally different but it's still they're testing their powers so their powers will be artillery their powers will be today Air Force if they has it they if they will be the Armored Division if they have that they will be their security it will be their spies so in in the battlefield is where all of this comes together and if you and I can just imagine tonight this very day just this being Thursday in the M the last night being the middle of the week untelling all the thoughts that have went through your mind already and the battle that is raged and War in your mind and it doesn't stop you come to church cuz many times when we come to the house of God and the presence of the Lord is there to help us and Deliver us that's when sometimes people's minds really go into a rage because Satan don't want to get anything out of the service you better believe he knows what I study he knows what the men of God study he he ain't no dummy he can read what I've got there he said oh no I don't want them to get help that'll help this young lady and that'll help this young man and that boy and that preacher and oh goodness I've got to do whatever I've got to do to to work on them so you come in and you sit down and isn't it amazing that the battle will pick up you're standing that they talking to one another smiling enjoying one another's fellowship and you come in you to sit down oh my goodness did I unplug my curling arm of course I'm speaking to Sisters hopefully tonight and not Brothers you know did I do this oh no did I do that you think where in the world is that coming from it's your enemy your enemy is shooting his ammo into your mind to to try to get something in your mind maybe you run into somebody out there and you didn't think they were friendly to you and they wasn't very nice let me give you an example I saw one of the brothers from our church here a couple of days ago over at the fellowship H and he come up and he was telling me a few things was just talking a little bit and fellowshipping and he said something to me and he meant it as as a compliment and I took it as a compliment but it has worried him to death he's not slept for the last four nights so he called me today and he wanted to apologize to me because it it has worried him to death he has Fred and he's been so concerned about he's probably listening to me right now and I told him I said brother don't worry about that I never even took it that way I never even thought that he said brother Donnie in service last night I couldn't even look at you while you were preaching cuz I thought you must think I'm awful now you know who was doing that don't you who the devil so the devil was firing his ammo into this brother and has been doing it for several days I said what I hate about the whole thing is that you waited this long before you just was able to talk to him and make it right now the devil won't just make us think bad thoughts about God he'll try to make us think bad thoughts about one another he'll try to make us think bad thoughts about the ministry if they're preaching and you know and this thing uhoh somebody's been talking to him somebody has told him I know there's no way he knew that I got an email from one of the sisters of our church week before last and she said brother Donnie a sister and I at the church was wondering if you have the church bugged because a sister and I was talking just a week or so ago and some of the very things that we were talking about you got up and preached about of course she meant it as a joke and I answered and said no I don't have the church bugged but God does so God knows exactly how to speak to us so however Satan can bombard our minds thoughts about one another thoughts about God thoughts about ourself that we think about oursel and we criticize oursel I don't know about you my greatest enemy is me my greatest enemy of all people is myself now I want you to notice how brother randam lays this out he said where each Army tests its strengths against the other Army I don't miss this when the great battle started on the earth there had to be a mutual place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin for the battle to rage and that Battlegrounds began in the human mind so it actually rages in our mind so it's not just like a little you know passive casual well how you doing today God and God answers the devil back well I'm doing pretty good how are you doing and then the devil says well I've been kind of busy today and you know I just been going around and God said well yeah me too I just been kind of hanging out you know trying to save the lost and trying to F with the Holy Ghost and so what you got planned tomorrow well I'm doing the same old thing what are you doing god well I plan on doing the same old thing too they're firing they're bombing they've got their smart bombs they've got their grenades and they're blowing up dirt and they're blowing up holes but guess where those holes are in your poor little mind it ain't no wonder sometimes we feel like our mind is about to explode anybody ever feel that way besides me and you feel like as the Bible says that yet you're at your wit's end it seems like there' be no peace now remember we're not the only one as Christians that go through this the people out here on the world you can hear them go through the drive-thru they'll tell you what a tri trial they have just the people you work with that don't even serve God because it's an onslaught of the last days and they don't even understand the degree that you go through because yours theirs is being bombarded just with the things of everyday life but God and the devil is bombarding you now think of it almighty God with all of his power but he cannot allow Satan to just put his thoughts there and then him not come back watch he said where the battle starts Hearts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was to begin that is because decisions are made from the mind I skipped on down a little bit in this paragraph and he says the Battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you decisions are made in the mind the head that's where Satan meets you and decisions are because that God made a man that way so and in that in mind you can imagine every day of our life we're going to be bombarded with right with wrong there was a certain man that was one of brother randoms Associates and he made a a personal testimony he left it behind so we' be able to listen to it and he went to Brother random after one of the services and he was actually standing in the prayer line and people would come and if they had a prayer card and they would take the prayer card and they would lead them up for brother brandham to pray for them and this brother came to brother brandham after service and he said brother brandham I am so ashamed I have to apologize and I have to ask you to forgive me for something he said brother what what was it and he said brother random when I was standing there in the prayer line up front tonight Leading the People the saints of God to you these horrible filthy thoughts were coming through my mind his answer always surprises me every time I quote it brother Bram said brother those thoughts were being aimed at me not you but you were in the way and they were hitting you and can you imagine a prophet standing there filled with the Holy Ghost Discerning telling people their names where they live their addresses you went to a doctor today heavy set man got glasses on he told you so and so and so can you imagine that's going on and the devil is still attacking his mind at the same time it may be strange and peculiar for you but the devil does a preacher the same way one that's not even gifted like brother Brandon I'll be up here preaching 90 miles an hour and you're thinking how can that man talk that fast but while I'm talking that fast the devil is looking for an opportunity to tell me they don't like what you're saying that person got up and walked out you made them mad it's amazing how he will fight you and then you're standing there oh no did I make them mad oh no did I say that and I'm talking 90 miles an hour when that's going on you say how in the world can that be I don't know how it is exactly but all I know is a gift in you it's different from you the anointing anoints the gift but the battle is still going on in your mind a Catholic priest said in one of brother bam services and he said he was sitting there writing stuff writing stuff and he said I thought that man is disagreeing with everything I'm saying but at the end of the service that man got up behind the pullit and said after this sermon we've got to get out of the mess the church has got to get out of the mess it's in or we got to get out of the mess the church is in so brother brandham thought humanly this man was disagreeing with everything that he said but actually that man got up and said basically an amen to what he said why is it doing it for to get that preacher off and if Satan can get that preacher think this one don't like it oh notice him he's asleep well maybe didn't sleep on all night last night he gets in church he gets comfortable he dozes off but here I am y'all are sitting there looking up this way but I'm standing up here looking back at all of you so this person gets up and goes out that one gets up and goes out some will set there in right and the devil will say look at them they're writing they're writing down things you've misquoted is that true most of the time it ain't it's good points to you it's things that you say oh I don't want to forget that don't you see he lies to me just like he lies to you so what if I get to thinking about that oh okay all right sis you quit writing now I I know you're writing something you're not writing something good and I could get under the influence of what a lie I know Sister Chloe better than that so what is it oh you mean he lies to you brother D just like like he does to you so what do I have to do I in my mind I know I'm talking 90 M an hour but I have to say it within me you're a liar shut your mouth I'm going to preach what God wants me to preach and yet that battle going on in my mind does it happen that way similar to you all when you're in the house of God sure it does now watch he says decisions being made in the mind then Satan will attack it and God will attack so Satan will hit you with things and then God will come back and say but don't the word say this didn't you just hear it last week in the preaching of the word this this and this oh yeah I heard that but I don't know if it was for me for not you know what you have to do what I have to do we have have to take sides when the Lord fires ammo we pick up that ammo and use it against the devil instead of us saying well I'm not sure if it's for me or not you understand what we do then we actually join sides in our mind and our thought patterns with the Enemy every one of us whether or not we realize it we are still human unregenerate as far as in our mind we have the capability of having Divine thoughts and horrible thoughts how many of yall has ever had bad dreams whether it was you know just ungodly dreams or fearful dreams or whatever it is and wake up I used to have a dream I haven't had it in no time tonight I'll probably have it again knowing me but it's it's the same dream I've had it for years and years and years and in the dream I will be sitting smoking a cigarette I've never smoked in my life and in the dream somebody comes up and says brother Donnie I can't believe you're smoking and I will always wake up out of that dream in a cold sweat Shake like a leaf so you can stand and tell your dream now you can tell yours so brother Donnie is that a hidden desire in your heart not hardly but don't you understand Satan has access to our dreams some of these things can actually be caused by medication I received a prayer request last night from a gr great servant of God wanting me to remember him because he's having nightmares because of things that he's going through like your mind your subconscious is also accessible so Satan will try to put it there in your mind why a dream like that can torment you to death and then you're scared to death you wake up thinking oh no oh no do I really want this and when you ask that question the devil's voice will say yeah you do you see you really want to do that what's he doing trying to attack the battlefield when you're trying to rest and God knows we all need rest don't we I like the way brother R deals with this in in Chicago in 1955 he says now it's a strange thing and so much thought of among people and they say well I'm weak and my faith is not very much I'm not a good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language so you mean the devil's language is not always curse words the devil's language is not always denominational theology or a catechism or a Creed which which oh I'm not saying that Creed I'm I'm not saying that well when we say this we're talking the devil's language so H H how does that come into us then again he will fire these smart bombs now we know in the day we're living there's two main categories of bombs I'm talking about natural ones one is called a dumb bomb y'all heard of them a dumb bomb okay it's not driven by GPS it's not precise markings then there's the smart bombs which are driven by laser or by GPS they have got them now to where they can actually so this bomb is going subsonic going less than the speed of of sound and if the target moves they can actually redirect that bomb midf flight and put that bomb down the hole of a tank or a man can crawl in and out of that hole about that Bigg round that's the smart bomb the dumb bomb they can be able to name it in a proximity it might be a quarter mile off this way quarter of a mile off that way so does God all of God's bombs are smart bombs he has precise things for what we need but the devil he uses a lot of them dumb bombs so he just fires them over here and fires them over there and fires them over here but remember them dumb bombs have a purpose because they're much cheaper to make some of those others can cost a half a million dollar a piece and the dumb bombs they might be 30 40,000 so there's still a tactical use for dumb bombs because they just fire them one after another after another after another and it's shock and all so it terrifies those on the receiving end where one smart heart bomb can be able to take out a tank a radar you know or whatever but sometimes they want these cheaper ones and they want them to go everywhere you see the devil likes these cheaper dumb bombs because he likes to drop them all around you every day of your life all kinds of thoughts they don't have to be precise you understand most of the things he tells us is absolute lies or contorted Twisted half truths what is it a dumb bomb and I guess I wonder sometimes who's the dumb or the bomb or me I'm going to go ahead and say it you are the bomb isn't it amazing why would we even believe anything he says I mean we're talking about the person the being that is called the father of Lies why do we even pay any attention to him why if he says that you're not a Christian you ought to shout hallelujah that's probably the best sign you are but yet he will keep firing and firing and firing and before long this will happen to us when people will say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to to say you're just talking his language right then you mustn't never now I know brother RM said a d double negative in that sentence but I'm not too concerned about Linguistics I'm more concerned about truth aren't you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time so that covers when you feel it and when you don't amen but but remember these bombs they won't all be great gigantic Earth shaking things but sometimes it'll be uavs you know what that is uavs unmanned Vehicles this is what makes it so dangerous in the age we're living drones drones as a matter of fact Lebanon sent one over across the Israeli border last night made it all the way in to an IDF Israel def Force into one of their greatest places where they keep their f-35s you know why they do that because they fly under radar and they fly so low unmanned nobody in them a person in Lebanon sitting there with goggles on and he's driving it so quiet you can barely hear them whisper and fly under the radar and they come right in and then they drop a bomb or they do whatever do damage and yet this is the age that we're living now look we know the natural also reflects the spiritual and this is where we are spiritually the devil's done figured out these uavs so sometimes he'll send a great big old thousand pound bomb my goodness it devastates your world other times he'll send in a little drone and he'll drop it on you and you say where did that come from I I had my radar up here of course if we've got a radar aimed way up here and we're not even looking down here look how a tiny drone you understand they've got drones that are not but 6 in by 6 in by n and can actually carry explosives on them robots Israel has developed robots and they have an army of them and they're dogs they look like dogs they're on their all fours they have machine guns on top coming out of their forehead it's unbelievable the Warfare so think of it when you think of what they've done in the natural how Satan he must do it because this message exposes him like he ain't never been exposed before I'm grateful for it don't you but you see what he does then he must update he must update if he don't if he doesn't do it well there's no way he there even be any competition in this war so once he sees what we've got and the Armament that God has given us then he has to come back say okay what can I do I've got to change this I've got to do this so what does he always revert back to it's always the mind but it's the way he approaches the mind so now watch a child of God loves the Lord oh my they don't curse that they're so watchful of their mouths but they say I'm not a very good Christian I don't have very much faith I I I don't know why I should even go to church that's one of the worst things you can do I know sometimes preachers may say things that make you think a little bit but there are certain things things that I pray I will not pray it out loud I will not pray it out loud he said brother Donnie really yeah question answer 64 brother brandom you told us why you went out west the first time you haven't told us why you went out the second time well he said it's something that the Lord is dealing with me and he said if I keep it in my heart Satan don't know what it is but if I speak it then he will hear it and try to stop it you realize he does not understand and know sometimes how effective the weapons he's using against us really are until he hears us telling our best friend I've been going through this oh it's killing me I'll tell you what it is weing me out oh my I tell you what and Satan says thank you thank you I didn't know if it was working or not I wasn't really sure well thank you for letting me know I I'm a better devil than I thought I was I am so effective against you you understand how we should watch what we say and even watch what we pray this is one of the reasons that Paul mentions in the Book of Romans that whenever we go to pray that we pray in the spirit and he said that we even Gran in the spirit and the spirit of God is groaning but it's a language that the spirit of God knows that we don't know remember brother brand being in the hotel room and he got down to pray and he was praying before the service and it sounded like someone was speaking German and he could hear it he said he thought M that person why he said they're speaking so fast and he said I never heard such and they was going on and on and he finally realized it was him so he come to himself Billy knocks on the door and he said he felt like he could leap through a troop and jump over a wall and he said thought oh my what was that there's something about that anointing when it comes that way come to find out they got to the service that night there was a man couple of men that was bringing a woman and there was in the back of a 1935 chiv they took the back seat out the woman was hemorrhaging pulled over on the side of the road and they thought she was dying it was the very moment that brother brand was praying and he said that angel of the Lord needed an urgent an urgent thing isin't it amazing that an angel of God could not do that the angel could come into the hotel room where he was and anoint him to speak in a language that he had never even learned before but the angel couldn't go directly before father father father look This Woman's about to die if you don't do something quickly why why couldn't that angel do that because you and I are his hands his feet his eyes his mouth praise the Lord so you realize the spirit of God can pray out of us I've done many times in the presence of God when I did not know how to pray for people and I just stay there and be there in his presence and feel something start moving from down within my being as it happened to me last night and something something starts uttering out of you in a language that you have no clue yet I've heard some of the languages that I've spoken around the world before been in an airport he said oh my goodness I've heard that I've heard that I've actually spoken that before where did it come from the spirit of God why that person has a need I don't know it maybe the individual don't even know it but the spirit of God knows it and the spirit of God will take you not just me but you any person that could submit to it if he desires to use you in that way and then Satan looks at that he says wow that's great that's tremendous so if God can do that and God can use them then I reckon I'll try the same thing so what I'm going to do I'm going to just I'm going to torment them I'm going to aggravate them I'm going to cause bad things to happen to them and I'm going to get them discouraged and then I'm going to get them to start saying what I want them to say and I want them to say I'm not a good Christian I I don't I don't have very much Faith he don't he don't love me I'm I'm nothing but a failure you understand what you're doing you understand what what I'm doing and I do that I'm creating I'm creating because I'm a son you're a son or a daughter of God Satan can take them words and cannot create anything because he's not a Creator but I am and you are so if he can put his words in our minds and get us to saying it I I'm no good I'll never amount to nothing I I don't know why the Lord even loves me I ain't got much faith I God I must not be one of God's favorite kids you know what you're doing you're creating this negativity Into Your Atmosphere you are responsible for the atmosphere that you live in and where does it come from the Battleground so Satan hits you and he hits you and he hits you and then God will hit you and you got big explosions over here and then you got big explosions over there no wonder we get so confused at times oh don't you think the Lord for his word though now watch let your testimony always and your thoughts never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it now watch how he separates it if you can stop it from coming into your mind then stop it before it does but sometimes it's like it just po there it is but if it does come into your mind mind don't entertain it I wonder how many of us would be honest tonight and say well that's why I've messed up sometimes cuz I've entertained the thought of the devil you know and yeah he told me I wasn't saved and told me I wasn't this and I got to thinking about that he went to tell me about this brother didn't like me and the next thing I knew I was shunning that brother or that sister and you know they didn't look at me right whenever I come into church the other night and then we entertain that thought now he said never permit a dager thought to come into your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well then be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could stop them from roosting so there's a good thing you see you can help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on now watch he's going to tell us how to do it now these are our smart bombs that are aimed back at the Enemy No Sir Jesus Christ is my savior so the devil raised up his head now what you're going to do you're going to zero right in on him and you're going to with what your feelings your opinion your idea no we're told what to to use against him don't use your feelings because he'll pick on you when you ain't feeling God that day and he'll whip you but the word is always the same whether you feed it or not now load yourself up now with these things Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God and I'm going to keep them now how is it by the grace of God this is the only way not your goodness not my goodness by the grace of God I'm going to keep and I'm going to testify of them God can only bless you as you confess that he's done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3 he said that he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us here's our a b c's he can only do for us as we accept a and believe B and confess c a b c except believe confess a't that awesome praise the Lord accept believe confess don't think sitting there in a wheelchair now you imagine he's talking to an individual that's sitting there in the surface don't think sitting there in the wheelchair that you're hopeless and helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind so negative thoughts that Satan puts in your mind about God or your pastor or your mama your daddy your husband your wife your boyfriend your girlfriend about yourself your walk with God you can't stop all of those from going through Satan knows he has a right hey this is my right fight he could say me and God fight here right there wouldn't it be so much easier if it was just in this church building right here was a Battleground we come in here tonight big holes blowed in the concrete holes blowed in the wall and said well we have to get the construction crew to come back and fix all these holes before Saturday night and Sunday morning my goodness what a mess but how much different it is when those holes are here that confusion is here and you get to where you say you don't know what to believe you don't know what to think oh thank God for his Mercy to us all we'd be a mess wouldn't we if it wasn't for the grace of God don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind that's right but don't let us stop like the old farmer said I can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double barrel shotgun and he said I sure can keep them from roosting so you do the same thing don't let them Roost don't let them let them pass right through here's the shotgun to use both New and Old Testament double barrel very good too now what's this one this is one thing I love about question answers even that the prophet did it 1964 brother brandom please explain how a person knows if he's thinking his own thoughts or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind this is an excellent question listen carefully how they wrote it now to make him think wrong especially if you know you don't want to think them they answered their own question they answered their own question because they knew brother Joe they were speaking their heart they were speaking the heart of a real believer yeah no doubt this believer was tormented by this and they spoke their own answer I am glad however the brother Ram answered it especially when you know you don't want to think them what he says if it's contrary to the word well this is really hard to understand ain't this answer so complicated I mean it's so difficult to right it's so difficult the only difficult part about it is we make it difficult he's answering this question in the way it was asked so it was asked from the heart of an individual that does not want bad thoughts from a heart of an individual that that's troubled because these thoughts are there so notice how he answers it if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking so the devil can use my mind to think his thoughts how can that be remember God has access to our mind where does it start the preaching of the building of faith comes by what faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God God and Satan both approach it in the same way God will get our attention by hearing then we take it into the womb inside of us and we hear it and we receive it we accept it then it comes to fruition it begins to mature the devil's thoughts are the same way so the devil projects his thoughts in your mind so what he'll do is I'm not a very good Christian I don't have very good faith now if you're a child of God that's not you thinking that but the devil is projecting his thought into your mind so where'd it come from same place it came in the Garden of Eden the first human being that he ever battled which was Eve so she began to listen to this whenever he said yeah yes God said You shall not eat of every u fruit of the tree of the fruit of the garden they said oh well you know God has said that that we can eat of it but God has said that that you shall not eat of the tree which is in the midst of the garden and God said we should not touch it un L we die so he comes back now he's never fought with a human being before fought with angels but never fought with a human being so he's learning as he's going so he catches her and says oh there it is right there right there so what what it is you see honey God is trying to keep something from you God knows in the day that you eat thereof you'll be his gods that that thought from the devil could never hurt her that word from the devil could never hurt her until she took it in her mind thought on it pulled it down into her heart began to meditate she made the devil's thought her thought she conceived in her mind that's what he wants you and I to do now does it me mean that we're not Christians after we do that no it doesn't mean that at all it just means we've allowed him an entrance into our mind to cause an unnecessary mind battle and temporarily we laid aside our smart Bombs all of our grenades all of our drones all of our things that God gave us and we picked up the uavs from the devil and the bombs from the devil and we started talking about his ammunition because remember he only has one weapon one weapon that's all try to make you doubt your weapon that's what the prophet said that's what he's used since the very fall of Man in the beginning and he still uses the same thing today to get you and I to doubt our weapon and when he does we're defeated right there even though he's a bluff has no power now watch he says if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking if it's with the word it's it's God's thinking if it's the wrong thoughts it's the devil but now wait a minute brother random I thought this question was it's in my mind well how do how does a person know if it's if it's them or the devil but watch what he's doing he's separating him said no you've done said you don't want them thoughts to be there you don't want to think that what makes you not want to think that when you were lost you did you you enjoyed thoughts of evil thoughts of wrong and thoughts of darkness and all that but once you become changed you don't enjoy that no more but yet through your same mind can pass thoughts oh my goodness if the Lord would put up here on these screens tonight thoughts that have come through all of our minds and begin to write your name and then make a list of your thoughts well let's started first let's start with me and then go to brother Joe and then do you and you and you and you probably time that got pass me there wouldn't be nobody sitting in these chairs y'all be done in your cars you'd be out down the road you said Lord have mercy I wouldn't want nobody to know what want to why why wouldn't we because it makes us ashamed and it makes us embarrassed is that right why because you love him you think it Sinners feel that way they love those thoughts they love to think on things like that but you don't so he'll put it in your mind and then condemn you for thinking what he put in your mind to do and then if we don't know the word then we say Lord is that me Lord do I think that I'm I'm sorry Lord is it me and of course every time that we ask a question yeah it's you see you ain't got the Holy Ghost that's what it is you're not elect you might as well just admit it you've made some many mistakes why you know you're serpent seed so you've got the serpent himself telling you that you're serpent seed the father of Lies huh oh my he said Brother D the devil's fighting me you ought to scream hallelujah it's one of the best signs there are that he ain't got you amen notice this in the case that it may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing thing how may it be overcome or got rid of listen what an answer take the vice versa here's her answer if the Devil Makes You think if the devil makes you think now listen if the devil makes you think that if you know you're a Christian you know you're a Christian and he tries to make you think you're not a Christian just take the vice versa I am a Christian as long as your experience matches in God's word say Don't just think it but say it why say it because your words become the progeny The Offspring the child the child of God's thought coming into your mind you accept it and you give birth to it in your confession it ain't enough just to memorize the word God wants to hear us say it praise the Lord I'm a Christian anything else the same way now listen how you answer this last part when you answer this please pray for me me to overcome this as I am not by myself so this was asked on the evening service of August the 30th 1964 here we are in May of 2024 and there's people sting right here tonight and they hear this service and we're fighting some of the same things this person your fault in 1964 can we say God help me God help me please pray for me to overcome and I want you to notice this prayer God grant your overcoming ever who you are God grant you overcoming ever who you are may your thoughts just go right back to the other side now he prays for them but he prays with this advice and counsel so Angel's praying oh God help you God help you he's praying that but he's also telling them what to do with his prayer now watch he says may your thoughts go right back to the other side and say I am a Christian I am a believer Satan you have no Hal on me now come on prophet of God be honest with us and unveil a part of yourself frankly I'm standing right here now saying the same thing keep from fainting right here at the pull pit that's right four or five times I've almost pitched over in the pullit wow so he is living the answer praise the Lord he's living that's so you see men of God are going through the first thing you know men of God don't don't don't make them Angels don't make them so high and so holy don't don't dehumanize them and say oh they never go through nothing they go more through more than you'll ever believe they go through in your life sure respect them and honor them and pray for them but they're humans just like you it's one of the greatest things I found in my years of the message that the message people want to de humanize our Prophet don't dehumanize him he was a human being I'm grateful that he shared these things with us so he could give this answer he could have easily eliminated these last six or seven lines but I'm so glad he didn't don't you appreciate that I often hear that you have to love everyone but you don't have to like them dear Jesus I'm going to need your help on this one I'm confused on how can you actively dislike someone and still love them as that doesn't sound like love to me I understand that people can rub you the wrong way and some are more prickly I couldn't keep from smiling as you did whenever I read this some are more prickly than others I call them Cactus Christians more prickly than others but I always feel like I'm supposed to like them anyway can you explain true Brotherly Love does that in turn mean you like everyone wow would anybody like to answer this one often hear that you have to love every everyone but you don't have to like them now you've heard me say it many times whenever I go to counsel a young couple and I will ask them have you prayed about yeah have you prayed about it do you love each other yeah and I will talk to them and talk to them and then I will always ask this I've done it for years decades and I will ask them do you like one another and they'll do the same thing most of you did they'll smile because that they don't understand where I'm coming from because what I found as a pastor what causes a lot of marital problems in the marriage bond is that a man and wife can love one another so much they would actually die for each other if it came down to it but the longer they're married they find things about each other that they don't like so I'll just make up a few so you can get my story so a girl comes from a norm in her home a Boy comes from a norm in his home now unless he's a different unusual boy you could go into his room and you'd have no problem with his stinking sneakers sitting you know over here maybe his dirty socks his dirty shirt that he wore yesterday just takes it off and throws over there there's probably something that's different from that and then girls you know maybe their etiquette and the way that they do things would be a little bit different now you can love that person with all of your heart but you do not like certain things about their habits and what they do and you'd be surprised at some of the things that I've heard as a pastor that husbands and wives get into arguments over I'll not go into any details I'll let you experience that yourself when you get married but now we do love one another but as brothers and sisters and Christians are there things about one another that we will dis like absolutely ah you were surprised by that answer were you because God loves The Sinner but he hates the sin watch this the prophet said God hates sin but he loves The Sinner so we could love brothers and sisters we could love people but it doesn't mean we like every thing about what they do maybe their mannerisms some folks you get around them and they're just you know really rude and crude and others you get around them you think oh they are so prim and proper I could never feel comfortable being around them look at them every hair is right in place and I I can't stand that about them well and it may be different than what you are but yet in reality does that mean that you don't do not love that individual well if you don't then you need to get get more the love of God in your heart again the prophet said God hates sin but he loves The Sinner but he hates his Works hates his works so God does not like it whenever a drunk will get drunk he doesn't like it when a man will beat his wife God hates that work but he loves that sinner does that make sense to you now you see the the thing of it is if we're not careful we will identify the Sinner and the works I hate them I hate them oh no that's totally totally wrong that's not the way God does it God loves The Sinner but hates the sin we should love one another as brothers and sisters now part of what we might dislike about each other is the atmosphere that we live in and the atmosphere that we create as I just spoke a little bit about now watch this now did you ever see people nice people but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around well isn't that kind of weird so they're really nice people but you can't hardly stand to be around them huh sure you have you don't have nothing ing against them but you just can't stand to be around them then you see some person that's oh maybe a little old scrawny fella a little old woman bent over a washtub but you just love to be around that person and you just love them somehow it's the atmosphere that they've got around them the way they live they create an atmosphere that you like to be in to that's lovely people to be with again he said did you ever see someone that you love to be around sure you have there's people that you meet and associate with and you just love to be around there's an air about them that you love to associate with them and then there's fine people I want you to notice that brother random is not making them now good people and evil people but there's some that's fine he calls them fine people people that you know are very fine people and there's something about them that you just don't feel at home around them somehow and you don't want to hurt their feelings they're your friends oh my goodness you love them but there's just a difference between them and this other person well what is it we create that atmosphere that's around us now part of that is the way we think the way we are brought up the way that we've been worshiped now let me just give you a little insight every church that you've ever been to and those that you haven't every church has a personality now what makes that personality are the people who come to that church now you watch it if if a church church will start getting an influx of people people will start moving from here and there and you know different places you will watch the personality of that church and it will start changing then some of the people that were there in the original Church they will sense it and they really don't like it because they liked it the way it was before because they identified this is my church and you all stay your own church if you don't mind and leave us alone because what will it do the needs of those people moving in will start moving the ministry to where the ministry will start preaching to their needs now maybe they wasn't taught this and that at the other in their Church where they went to and their need will cause God to lay it on a preacher's heart and then the people there they're sensing a change in their church and they get scared you know how we all are about that oh oh I I don't like what's going on oh oh my goodness they're singing some new songs oh goodness they're they're not singing Rock of Ages cleff for me they're singing these new songs oh the goodness of God oh my goodness and a lot of older people they get scared out of their minds why because they can sense the personality of the church changing oh I'm sorry y'all didn't know that well I give away a preacher secret tonight didn't it so it's the same in your home man marries a woman they have a certain personality a norm in the home it will be that way for several years until they have a baby and then that baby will start changing the personality of the home then the personality will come the new Norm with mother father and the baby it will be that way for quite some time until another one comes along now this child is going to be different from the first one was a model child it went to bed at 8:00 at night and slept on 9:00 to next morning it never had the collic it never had this and that oh it was a model child and mother and father think they want another model child but guess what they get one that broke all models it cries it screams it kicks it comes red hair no offense now oh oh my goodness oh it's so different than the other what did that new baby do change the personality of the family you see what I'm saying now did the you know the first born now that's five and six years old it can't sleep at night because the baby's screaming it's squalling it's dirty stinking diapers are all over the house and this little guy is having an awful time with this new personality in the home and there probably times he wish he could take it back back to the doctor those of you that's ever been at the med center in Johnson City I have to go there a lot to visit the sick going down the hallway when you get off the elevator on the second floor you GA the elevator you go right or left rather you go left go here you make another left go down there make another left turn around go through this way and there's signs on the wall about this big it's little handwritten notes from kids it's some of them are quite funny and one of them was God I want to thank you for the baby the baby brother that you gave me but I actually ask you for a puppy so you know that's the way it is sometimes in a in a church so people come in and they come in oh no more people that means brother Donnie's going to have to counsel more and oh no I don't get enough time with him the way it is why don't all these people stay at home so each of us have our personality and we have traits about us now Carol and I as yall know we're born on the same day same month month same year I was born that morning she was born that afternoon we're born under the same star the same sign you don't believe in that look at question 64 and you see the prophet taught that to us and there's ways about us that we are so much alike it's scary and there's ways about us that is so different Carol is one of the neatest human beings that God ever let breathe a breath of life don't bny however I like being neat every now and then Carol cannot stand for a drawer to be opened in our house so upstairs I had this antique piece and in there I have screws and screwdrivers and all types of things in order to move pictures and clocks and things like that on the wall for Carol though I look at it when a picture Finds Its Place leave it there till it falls off but Carol loves change so years ago I put a hammer in there and a tape measure and a level and so on and so on so Carol wants this picture mve from here to over here will you move it sure sure I'd love to I go open the drawer I get the measuring tape I get this that the other I take it into the room I forgot maybe a you know a Wall anchor I go back guess what the drawer is shut well I know I didn't shut it cuz I knew I probably would forget something guess who come in behind me and shut it see it's written all over her face guilt I mean it's guilt now you saying I know it's funny and you say wow yeah that that's really very but you'd be surprised how many people have problems and issues over something like that now down the basement I like of food with Taxidermy so I I build all kinds of different things down there and I've got plastic cabinets from Lowe's and they stand about this time they got two doors and this one let me see let me call for my mind first one here on the right I've got Moss I've got antlers elk antlers I've got um mule deer antlers I've got white tail deer antlers second one coming there let's see open it okay I've got uh choice Cactus I've got a photographic memory I've got choya Cactus I've got glue the third one here I've got plants I've got all kinds of things so if I'm doing that I'll come down through there and I'll open them up all the way down through there Carol comes down the basement to visit me you guessed it she starts at the bottom of the steps so if I know she's coming I just go ahead and do it myself just take the fun out of it for her you know there's things like things like that that people can just get on one another's nerves over you know people have a little twitch about them have you noticed how he does that oh I can't stand that that runs all over me when he does that what is it there's something about us though as humans that other people's things like that bother us we say I just don't like being around them I just don't like them it don't mean you don't love them they are preacher friends that I have around the world I will never be as close to them as I am the brothers in our church here brother Ron Spencer is one of my CL friends brother Tim put I consider them probably two of my closest friends brother Fred Mullins another one of my closest friends I've got preacher friends all over the world by the thousands of them but yet if I would be around them and they would be around me they say man a little of brother Donnie goes a long way because my human makeup would be there I ain't talking about Sin you understand what I'm saying so there's people that were more compatible with watch brother bman we'll close with this now you might say I sure don't like brother Neville or I sure don't like brother Jones and I don't like brother Sona or something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart's broke it nearly kills you we can obtain brotherly kindness and a feeling for one another but to maintain it in a group of people why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight you fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with and cause you kind of stay which we ought and and notice what he says here we oughtn't to do it but shun him a little bit don't you love the honesty of this Prophet but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would nearly kill you or that sister I'm an old man and I was once young and now I'm old and I've seen it down through the age do that here people say well I just don't have no more to do with him and something happened to that man and it nearly kills you he thinks oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him see it's Brotherly Love there may be people in our church that you will never be compatible with I encourage you go out of your circle go out of your comfort zone and try to be friends with people I'm not tell you do something I don't do myself I do I reach out to preachers and sometimes I may have preachers to come and preach for us and you think why would brother Donnie do that I know they differ in Doctrine I know that they don't agree but can you imagine how many churches brother brandham would have preached in if he would have only preached in churches that agreed with him things that are to be preached in Rialto California 12765 one of the last sermons that he preached preached in an Assembly of God Church he preaches on Election preaches on predestination goes into the godhead and the young man there was was a pastor was an Assembly of God brother B didn't agree with that man but the man invited him to come and preach so what do we do we love one another brotherly kindness goes beyond our dislikes for one another well I don't know if I'll ever be close friends with that brother that sister well you may not but you can at least try and if you can't find that compatibility where you'll be the best of friends after all that's why we have friends and we have best friends do we not there's preachers around the world that I could contact them tonight if I was in need of prayer and I would feel perfectly fine with doing that but if I was really going un through something and I needed a preacher to really reach out to and contact brother I need a friend to talk to believe it or not it's really hard for a preacher to find that because some preachers have got longer tongues than about anybody you know of they gossip they talk about this and that and the other I hope you don't think less of me but I try preachers I try them I'll tell them something they may think it's top secret but I know it ain't and I'll see in a month or two or three or four if that comes through the loop and it comes back to me and I know I won't trust that old boy and I did it for a reason God does us the same way so the thing that we never want to do is be so so clannish and so clicky in our own ways and I know our church has them every church has them if every Pastor would just be honest because there's people we feel closer to but that does not mean we should ever treat anyone bad and if you're in a certain category financially you should never look down on those that don't have what you have or maybe in your education you're Superior well I graduated from high school you outdone me cuz I didn't I've been thinking about getting my GED what do y'all think you think I need it you think it' make me a better preacher no you don't think all right thank you he discouraged me from doing it right there didn't take much did he but you see even though there'd be things that would differ if you ever had it to happen to you where maybe somebody you really didn't feel that close to and yet you hear oh my goodness oh something happened to him oh goodness oh Lord please don't let nothing happen to him Lord please you understand what that was that was the real love of God in your heart it was able to go past a certain thing a certain preacher got me great damage oh oh my goodness several several years ago just like to tore my heart out of me I didn't think I was ever going to get over it and I heard that something happened to the man and I I was so grateful with a feeling that I had it was not one of vindictiveness it was not one of oh boy God's getting back at him it was one of sympathy and I felt sorry for it I'll probably never be close friends with that man there was a preacher done something to me when I was a child it's affected me my entire life I saw him several years years ago at my aunt's funeral in Kentucky I had seen him for a long time Carol was sitting by me in the funeral home as you come up to the aisle on a walker and Carol grabbed a hold of my hand squeeze it you okay you okay yeah sweat pouring down my face my heart racing I could feel my blood pressure as it went up and my face flushed because of what that man done to me scarred me for my entire life but I was so happy for the feeling that I had when I and the Lord helped me to be able to get my composure together and I looked at him he didn't see me first he walked up to the casket viewed the body turned around and when he turned around his eyes fell on me I was looking at him he was looking at me first time I'd seen him in many years my flashbacks were not good my memories were not pleasant but down in my heart what I felt was pity not anger not hatred and I whispered a prayer through my tears through my sweat I was so nervous sitting there my feet were bouncing off the floor like that but I pray God forgive him help him to make peace is that the way you want to feel sphe Lord Jesus thank you for this time we can spend together like this Lord I Thank you for our use Lord God what I would have given to be able to attend a youth service onever I give my heart to you as a boy my to be able to ask questions Lord now we moved into a day that you're mindful of your use Lord you want them to be able to have places where they can meet and fellowship I pray that our youth would never take it and that it become so common to them Lord that they don't realize how sacred it is what would have give for a minister when I started preaching at 18 what I would have given for an elder that I could looked up to as a mentor that I could have asked him questions received instruction from Brother tell me how how to study tell me tell me how to yield to the Holy Ghost help help me brother help me and yet I see some of the preachers in this message that are so arrogant that you offer to try to help them but they don't want your help they want to get in your pull pit they want you to recommend them to somebody but they want nothing from you as far as spiritual input and I have to say it it's fearful Lord and I think is that the next generation of message preachers it's not about how they can serve God's people but what they they can get out of of it what kind of a following they can have Lord Jesus we love you tonight father oh search our hearts Lord may we take these things dear God may we know how to fight the enemy a little better after this question about thoughts Lord after this one about liking one another and maybe certain people that we don't like their Atmos sphere and may we see deep down Lord that we love people and it would break our heart to hear of anything happening Lord we want more of your love Jesus oh forgive us of our wrongs Lord of our shortcomings make us more like you Jesus praise the Lord can we stand together thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus go ahead and sing for usly Spirit yes

mey Spirit love through me amen do you enjoy that tonight you know in Warfare part of fighting War for uh a war fighting a battle is having intelligence and tonight you received a lot of more intelligence than Satan wanted you to have tonight you you asked a question on how do I fight this so you came in here tonight and you found out a tactic that the devil uses on you and how to overcome it you know I like to I few months ago last last fall last winter I went through something mentally um I've preached at a church in another state and had an8 hour drive home and in that 8 hour drive home Satan talked to me for 8 hours trying to tell me something Satan will put something in your mind and make you think it's God that's one of his tactics I got home I went to bed and I couldn't sleep I was tormented so much I I heard my own voice talking to me like I'm talking to you right now I wasn't talking I wasn't saying anything but I heard my own voice telling me you've got to do this God wants you to do this you got got to go do this and I was in torment never been that tormented in my life and I got up early the next morning and I I called brother Donnie and and just simple as he makes it seem so simple he said brother Joe God don't torment that's simple God don't torment so them thoughts that you get so often that that's torment you like brother benett said there's only two forces that work in our life there's two forces one's the devil one's God it's not you God and the devil but Satan's got a job to do that's what what I I love so much that that question that was asked tonight about our thoughts Satan's got a job to do you might overcome that thought you might pray and God take that thought away from you Satan's got another one coming but I always thought this if he would get in the mind of Jesus Christ cuz the Bible tells us that he took Jesus to the temple Satan took him Jesus didn't follow him Satan took him and he tempted him all this will I give you brother brandom said and how can I overcome say Jesus was tempted to do it so if he's going to tempt Jesus Christ who are we that's the battle we have to fight too every day one Split Second millisecond before the Rapture takes place Place Satan's going to be in your mind so take take that with us tonight you know and the other question you know I when it talks about like loving one another and being friends I like to quote the great scholar Rob Weber try to make a new friend this week brother brother Rob's always about making friends don't stay in your little circle let's if you got a click let's trade clickmate how about that go get somebody one out one of these other clicks or make your click bigger how about one great big click and have everybody in it don't matter if you're compatible or
