Lord you didn't do it out of Duty you didn't do it because it's what you were supposed to do Lord you've done it because you loved us more than we could ever think that you could love us Lord you had

that you'd meet the needs father that was mentioned here Lord the the prayer requests the hands that was raised every need that's here right now father I pray that you would meet it bless the pastor Lord as he's he's preaching on the road Lord might you keep your hand upon him we thank you for it in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles and turn to I'll read one scripture then we'll sit and we'll read some more scriptures here uh Genesis chapter 3 and we're going to read verse 5 for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the women the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took off the fruit of the fruit thereof and did eat and also gave also onto her husband with her and he did eat you could be seated as you're seated if you we're going to read also in Luke 23 and Revelations 5 Luke 2332 and 3 three as I read these you're going to think brother Joe those scriptures make no sense together and they really don't but they will and there was also two other maleactors LED with him to be put to death and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the maleactors one on the right hand and the other on the left in Revelation 5 we're going to read 3 through 5 and no man in heaven no man or nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look there on one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof now you look at those and you think those don't make any sense together and they really don't when you read them but with permission from brother Donnie Brothers you got that picture you would put up for me I asked brother Donnie if this would be all right to do this and he told me I could I don't know if we have it yet but y'all remember when Brother David Mayer was here preaching a few months ago when he mentioned the painting Checkmate so as he's talking about that painting and everybody know that painting was done by Frederick marit's wretch and he I don't know what went through his mind when he made this painting but this painting was of a man losing his soul to Satan in a game of chess and The Story Goes and I I'll tell you the history of it but the story goes that this painting was hanging in the Lou and the grand Chessmaster walks by this painting as he walks past this painting he stares at it for a while and he looks at the painting and he stands there and he calls the M they say he calls the museum cator over and tells him this is not right the King has one more move yeah amen so how these scriptures go together along with many other in your Bible these are three times that Satan thought he had checkmated God God yeah in the garden at Calvary and over your Redemption Satan had it perfectly planned out when they put him in the ground he said Checkmate so later that week I was telling brother Jimmy this and and I hope and pray to God that I can give it to you the way this message was GI to me later that week I woke up you can take it down there Brothers if you will I woke up in the 2: in the morning now again I'm I'm not a spiritual person like you know I don't have visions and dreams and and things like that but there's sometimes that that I I wake up in the middle of the night and I'm I'm wide awake and I'm usually woke up by a thought and this thought that that came to me was the King has one more move as I'm sitting there laying it laying that Revelation 55 started going over and over in my head and it didn't go like I just read it to you what how I got it was one of the elders he says I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book could read the book to open and read the book and neither to look there on one of the elders said unto me weep not the King has one more move that's how it was given to me and you got got to look it Satan's for for now this is probably going to go slow so I apologize Satan's from the moment in the garden you know Satan's been trying to Checkmate that seed every time he can that's been his purpose when God stands there in the garden and tells Satan the seed of the woman will bruise your head and you will bruise his heel God told Satan what his move was going to be because brother brandham said God said I'm going to provide a deliverer so we we look at that and we know it's it was in Satan's nature to always to to get one up on God even when he was in heaven brother brandom said when God created Lucifer when the the closest angel that could ever be to God when God created him God knew he was going to be a devil you got to understand this this this whole game this whole chessboard that God laid out he knew every move before it was ever made you know when I was studying this I got to think of my father-in-law Jack I've never beat him in Checkers in fact I gave up 20 years ago never played him anymore when you made your first move Papa would let you make the first move and then he knew every move you was making after that I don't know how he done it I still think he cheated but I've never I've never seen anybody beating and that's when I I got to thinking of that you know that's the way God was God God laid the board out he saids Satan Make Your Move make your move and Satan says I I'm going to ascend to the north sides of Heaven want to be like God and you know where that move got him it got him cast out but God always had a move to counter Satan's move brother brandham says in the infallible proof of the resurrection and now when God had promised a royal seed that would come forth as a savior it's been the work of God's enemy the devil to destroy that seed all the way down the first thing when the righteous son was born Abel and the unrighteous was born Cain first he slew able thinking he was getting that righteous seed that was Satan's move he knew he had to get get the seed and God allowed it every move that Satan has made and and I want you to realize that in your life tonight every move that Satan makes in your life is allowed if you are a bride of Christ you are a son and daughter he cannot do anything just like job he could not touch job until God took the Hedge down and God allowed him so any move that Satan has on us son or daughter of God is allowed why cuz God's got to move to counter It Go Satan will never make a move in your life that God don't have another one God always has a move so we we look at at this says for he was standing there when God pronounced the Everlasting Earthly judgments upon the people and upon the serpent upon the ground and he promised that the through the woman would come a seed and this seed would bruise the Serpent's head and the serpent found that all that seed all down through the age and he still fighting it then when he slew Abel he thought he got it Satan thought he had Checkmate when he got able he destroyed the only righteous part of the seed then God raised up Seth to take his place a beautiful type of the death of Christ and resurrection of Christ and then he thought he had him when he got the prophets he thought he had him when he got John but when he finally slew the righteous seed and he was buried on the third day Satan thought this a Checkmate I've got him now God raised him up from the dead the Lord Jesus now to give you the the actual history of this painting on I'm not a I'm not into art so y'all that probably know this history better than I do I apologize and I'm not into chess so I know nothing about either one of them so I'll take Corrections later but the the history when I looked up the history on the Checkmate painting used to be in the Lou in 1999 it was sold to a a private buyer but back in the late in the middle 1800s Paul morphe was considered The Grandmaster the chess Grandmaster of the world and one one evening he was got invited to this rich man's house in Richmond Virginia and this rich man had a copy of this painting over the mantle and that's where Paul morphe stands and and looks at the painting for so long and he stares at it and they say he actually pulled out a chessboard and set all the pieces back up and won the game so I got to looking at that picture and the picture that they showed there is in the the story that the artist wret was trying to make was this guy I thought you know a lot of these painters expressed things that happen in their life they would express it in painting I thought what kind of Life did this artist have that he was actually painting a picture of the devil winning right this guy look if you look at the picture and then I got to look at the picture this man is he's lost he's got this look on his face just like of defeat yeah and and I noticed he he's playing this game but the problem with him is he's looking at his opponent's pieces instead of his own he's looking at what the enemy is doing to him instead of looking what he could do right and so many times in in our life you know this is a game of life I don't want to offend nobody well you shouldn't call this a game of life that's what brother brandham called it I'll read you the quote in a minute you're in a game of life and brother brandham said you have to play by The Game of Life by God's rules and understanding that you if you understand God one little bit you got to understand that you have an opponent that God has allowed to sit across from you God's already played the game yeah he's played the entire game he's won the entire game amen he's never lost right and now it's your turn so what did what did Jesus come to do to play the game and win to show that no matter who your opponent is across from you no matter where his pieces are are on the board how many of the pieces of your chest pieces he has taken it doesn't matter you always have a move your king is the most important piece on the board amen your king will always have a move how many understands where the word Checkmate came from Checkmate is a is a Persian word came from shamat or sham mate it means your king is helpless your king is useless and sometimes that's all we hear we we we don't hear anything else because that's you know we would never say that but our actions do come on when we get to the point where where we think we can't we've got nothing left because we're looking at everything the enemy is doing we're looking at what Satan's doing in our lives and and we can't see what God already said he would do for us do you realize you make your king helpless you make him helpless God is moved by faith God is moved by faith it takes the hand of Faith to reach out to God and pick him up Pi the king up and move him over here yes sir it takes Faith yes sir the brides in a game is a game the game of life and God left the blueprint brother brandom says faith over Victory that's the way it is with human life you can't play the rules of the game of Life wrong and expect to win you've got to play it according to God's word what do we have in God's word anything you ask in my name I will give it to you I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world if you have faith the grain of a mustard seed you could say to this mountain be thou lifted up and cast to the seed it will be so that's God's word amen Satan's always tried to beat God since his existence and it's the god in you that he's trying to beat if you have the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost he's going to do everything he can to beat you he's one of his strategies is to get you to look at his moves oh yes come on thank you have to understand your adversary the Bible says he's worthy adversary he's worthy unless you let the king play the game oh you let the king play the game he's no match for your king amen amen he's no match he's already proved it and and we claim to have the king in here yeah we read in Isaiah how art thou fallen from Heaven o loose for Son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which weakest the Nations for thou Hast said in th heart I will Ascend un into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be of the most high here is Satan trying to to tell what his move is and it got him beat but said when he made Lucifer he knew he'd be the devil he had to let it be there to show that he was he was the Savior the Christ he had to let it happen so many times Satan all these events play out through the scriptures when Satan's looking for that seed in the garden when he slew Abel when that seed is carried over in the ark and when you see it coming on down every time Satan tries to stop it he thinks he's checkmated God yes sir and when you stumble and you fall and you make a mistake he's standing over you saying Checkmate he's telling you I've got you you can every one of you can sit here tonight only you and God knows your life only you and God knows if you're an unbeliever only you and God knows if you're a mate believer or a True Believer but God knows everything every mistake that you've made every fault and failure that you've make you can't cover it from God but a true bride will always look to that King for the next move instead of focusing on the faults and failures a true bride will always get back up and get back in the game I I love that that God hinted hinted to the devil what he was going to do in the garden I'm I'm going to bring a deliverer and he's going to he's going to destroy you yeah he's going to put his his heel on your head you'll not have dominion over him you'll not have dominion over his seed and God told him that God didn't hide that from him but yet God still allowed these moves so brother brandom says in God commissioning Moses God promised he could do it God said we could do it God promised our fathers that we was going that we what our land and that what belonged to us no matter if they got the walled cities they look like Giants and everything else he said quit looking at Giants yeah that's what he told Moses when you go into the land you don't look at the Giants what was the report from these people that came back why they were they were looking at at all the moves around them that the enemy was making we look like grass Hoppers their cities are so big they're so w there we can't overcome them their their Warriors are like giants there's nothing we can do we can't take it when you get that attitude you're already beat you're already beat when you look at the problems in your life and we all have them and you say I don't see no way out of this I I don't I don't see no way to get through this you're already defeated yeah you we we we've been taught year after year after year from from the prophet already bringing it all the way to this you don't look at circumstances and symptoms that's right you you don't you don't look at the things that that are falling apart around you the whole world is falling apart we don't look at circumstances he said quit looking at Giants and start looking at God's word and when men and women quit looking at their sicknesses and diseases and start looking at what God said about it you'll take over you will overcome are you sick quit looking at it yeah he said you could have healing are you depressed he said you could have joy you could have peace everything you have in your life it's just one move over you make that move by the hand of Faith picks it up and moves it to that next spot all things are subject to Christ Jesus Christ all things are subject to you in prayer when you ask in his name and believe in perfect faith I I'm reading a lot we'll get we'll get out of it here in a minute now remember they had the power Jesus had given them the power to heal the sick to raise the dead and cast out Devils just a few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use the power what did what did Brother brandom say about the power that we all had you you you know how brother Brandon went through that description of the the planets and the universe and the galaxies and Beyond how many light years it was away and he said all the the power that God used to create that so that same power is in you but if you don't have faith you can't use it you might have all the chess pieces but if you don't know how to play chess brother Rob you've lost yeah if you don't if you don't understand the game if you don't have the ability to say I know how this piece moves I know this this little horsey thing goes up two and over one yeah I know these little castle looking things can only go straight or sideways if I right or wrong you have to understand you have to know what you're you've been given that's right you have to know the ability just because you have the power that don't you know what what did Brother bandom say about having power without character is satanic yeah but having power with God faith you'll overcome anything that comes in your life you'll overcome anything that he brings against you yes sir but you have to understand the game you're in Hallelujah good you know I was talking to to brother Jimmy back there a while ago and while I was studying this I was I was thinking you know for all my life I thought God's final move for my Redemption was the cross I thought that was God's final move for me brother Jackie was the cross cross I said brother Jackie it occurred brother Jimmy it occurred to me that if that was God's final move I have to stop at John 316 that's where I got to stop God's got no more moves for me because I don't understand the game any further than that come on there's so much more to the game beyond the cross yeah when you're playing the game of redemption I would have loved to been in J in John's spot when he went up in into heaven and he's he's weeping because there's this book and no one can open the book yeah and John's weeping and John said I looked everywhere John made every move he could make to find somebody that was worthy to open that book so what was God's final move for my Redemption the cross was one of his moves right he went and hell that was one of his moves he kicked the door in he conquered death Hell In The Grave that was one of God's moves yeah but his final move for me Redemption was when he took the book he took the book that's all I needed for Redemption I couldn't be still sitting at the foot of the cross there's much more to this game of redemption than sitting under the cross you can't play this game without the cross you can't play it without the cross because the game's over if that's where you stop amen but the brands had perfect Faith they had the power Jesus had given them the power to heal the sick to raise the Dead cast out Devils just a few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use the power now there's the brandom Tabernacle they have the power but not the faith to use the power the bride today you have to have that the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got the faith to move it see what I mean it takes Faith to move it and all things are possible to him that believe you just just be that simple in your faith then God will go to work for you he's obligated to his word all things are possible to them that believe whatsoever things when you desire believe that you shall receive them you shall have them they'll be given to you amen that's God's requirement and faith is what it takes to move God so when you're in the game and you're in the spot you have no what you don't know where your next move is my first suggestion is quit looking at the enemy's pieces but what doesn't matter what he's moved around you he might have moved a a a besetting sin up around you and got you in a corner whether it be lust whether it be bitterness whether it be this or that whatever it is he's got you in a corner and you don't see no way out always look for your king oh always look for your king and you're in this spot and you you don't know which way to go but if you have the power and the faith that's what picks up your king and moves him there's not one move on the on your Board of life that keeps that King from moving wherever he has to move it doesn't matter if he's got every one of his pieces you're in the center of the board and every piece is around your piece you still have a king and he's got one more move you know what when I when I was reading the history on this when I was his reading the history on this and it came to me that a lot of these other famous chess players came and looked at the same painting and and they said poor Paul morphe was wrong this can't be done you know what it really resonated with me because I I said that's the bride today that's what the bride is hearing today from people around there they're looking at you say you can't live that way I know you're past come on you can't do that I know what you've done in your life some of some of you have have have probably haven't seen people in your old life and and you might have been the worst in the crowd and then you might go visit them you ain't seen him in 20 years and they're going to they're not going to believe that God got a hold to you my dad will tell you that his friends he was rough but there's always going to be people that tells you I don't need a pastor you don't need a pastor you don't need a preacher you don't need to go to church come on there's no such thing as a prophet they're always going to tell you there's always going to be naysayers in your life get used to it yeah get used to it true you don't you don't quit your football team being a fan because somebody told you they ain't no good do you you don't quit the things that you enjoy because somebody's talking bad about it why would you let that change what you believe when you got people telling you you can't do it come on as long as you got a king that has a move you can do anything through Christ Jesus anything it's the difference being consumed by your enemy's position people become consumed by it I've had people have things in their life and say well Joe I I can't get over it I I can't get over it I can't get rid of this this thing I've prayed for people that that have had problems in their life and you go with them and you pray with them the years later they still have the same thing they might have the power but they don't have the faith right and they haven't made that King their centerpiece they haven't made the king the most important player on the board well br said now right in front of you this is one of my favorite quotes stands a person just like you was a few minutes ago he's talking to sick people you are sick down here but there's a well P person standing there yeah you were sick here you've got to move from here to hear yes that's a move that you have to make yes amen you got to understand God's not going to let you sit on the on the the viewers table over here and let you watch while he plays the game for you you've got something to do you have something to do God is looking for your faith to move him yes sir not just sit here God you I can't do it today you go ahead and do it for me but God says you have to move from here to here Yes Lord From sick to wh okay Jesus Christ is calling to that whale person right Beyond it now you just by faith as you close your eyes you not God you walk into the whale body okay you walk into it yes that's that's we we've come so accustomed to people doing things for us for for God you know just I give it to what what do you do with I gave it to God well what are you doing about it you got this besetting sin in your life well I've gave it to God I guess I'll keep doing it till he takes it away he'll never take it away come on if you're saying God take it away from me I'm going keep doing it till you take away Lord I don't like it then why you keep doing it okay if you want to get rid of something bad enough if you don't like it that much you'll do whatever you can to get rid of it that's right instead of feeding it right if you can't handle your little phone throw it out of the game that's right get you a flip phone smoke signals Morse code hey if if it's something you can't handle you evidently not sick of it enough okay you're not sick of it if if if you can't if you can't go from your church family family here and then you go to work and you're a different person at work than you are here you don't love him enough you don't love him enough because if you love him enough if you love your king enough and you've given him your everything everybody you come in contact with is going to know it they're going to tell that something different in you so how do we learn to play the game how do we we learn and I'm not talking about regular chess I used to know how to play a little bit but evidently I knew so little it didn't take me very long to forget it all I know is that little horse can move up two and over one I don't know why that has suck in my memory so how do you learn how do we learn this game of life you're getting a lesson tonight you you get some more instructions on Sunday you've been given instructions where you could push play and I don't mean on Sunday morning you've been given books they're in the library that show you how to play this game yes that shows you how to to how to use your k King how faith can move your king yeah he's always got one more move it doesn't matter what what what you're into you know like I've had people ask me how do I get the Holy Ghost I and what the Holy Ghost you know when it's to me it's I don't know how to simplify it anymore just ask oh just ask you can't work it up said you can't work it up no it's freely given it's it's it's freely given and you can't play this game without it you can't all you'll do all you'll do is is is open open the box put the pieces up and then you're lost because you have to have the Holy Ghost to play this game amen you have to have the Holy Ghost to move the king yes sir thank you Lord I'm scooting through here you know what I studying said begin to look at David looking at David is David was the type of guy we know that the scripture says that when he fought Goliath that he was 15 years old brother brand mentioned he's 15 years I was looking up history and history was saying David was about 15 years old when he he met with Goliath but I always looked at David and and thought you know but God used David in this took David down in this Valley to fight this this giant because he wanted to show comparison in size it maybe he did so no matter how big your your trial is you can still overcome it but you got to understand Goliath was the champion the enemy's Champion it was going to take a king to beat this guy oh it was going to take a king and where was the king at the King was sitting up in his tent didn't even have his armor on because he offered it to David yeah but read the chapter before that chapter 16 1 Samuel God says I've rejected Saul as king he tells Samuel go to the house of Jesse I have a king amongst them he didn't say I will have one he said I have one and there Sam anoints David so David fights Goliath as a King David is a king God says this is a fight for a king you can't face him unless you are a king so David Gets anointed king of Israel one chapter before and you got to understand something it wasn't it wasn't David it was David's faith in God that took him down in the valley it wasn't God's faith in David what did David say David goes into the into the army in the camp and say what's going on I'm he was just there to bring food to his brothers he didn't come there looking for a fight he didn't come in there trying to to find somebody to whip Hey where's the biggest giant hey give me some armor give me something I I can use I'm great at this game he just want to say hello how y'all doing he didn't realize he was a king and God God takes him and then he hears the enemy he hears the boast of the enemy yes he says Let Me In the game that ought to be the Cry of every one of us tonight when you see your brother and sister the enemy coming against them Lord let me in the fight this is this is a fight for a king yes you you can't beat the enemy if you're not a king how many knows your Kings Tonight the same chapter when John said behold the L lamb of the tribe of Judah has prevailed read read down a few more verses you've been made Kings and Priests that's right why because he knew when he was putting you in the game he was putting you in the the game it would take a king to win this one it takes a king to win the battles because you're fighting what does what does it say in that same scripture you fight against powers and principalities that's what it takes so it takes a king so David goes down in there into this Valley he tells Goliath I come to you in the name of the most high God in the name in it yeah not by the name he was in it when you come against the when you come against Satan every day of your life when you wake up in the morning you better step into that name because it's in the name if you look up the definition of in in the Bible it means a position a position not some Banner I'm in cuz I look I got the name of my team right here not a word on your shirt but it's it's in here it's it's anchored in here you're in the name David didn't go into that Valley under his own name I'm David of the House of Jesse God said I'm sending a king down there I've never looked at it that way before that David was already anointed a king and then God the next chapter God throws him against the biggest enemy Israel has the entire Army Israel's entire Army was scared of this guy yes sir I think the Bible says over 800,000 men or something like that was in the is the Israelite Army every one of them and what happened with David David didn't look at the moves that the Philistines were making that was just another chest piece to him it was just another piece I got to take that one too I've already killed a lion I've already killed a bear I'll take care of him too right amen that ought to be our attitude towards everything that comes in our life I had a toothache yesterday but I prayed about it and God took it away I had a headache day before that God took it away now I have cancer well God's going to take that away too yeah quit looking at the size of your enemy yes quit looking at the things in your life that you put size to that you put volume to amen that doesn't matter to God God don't look at how big something is how huge something is God don't see size God sees Faith that's all he sees is Faith you got to understand faith is the substance of things hoped for but fear takes that substance away fear takes it away from you David had no fear fear had took all the substance from Israel yes sir Israel no longer knew how to fight they didn't know how to fight they were worried about food David was bringing in what did David's Brothers tell him David you need to go back home you need to going back home that's what that's what the devil's telling you hey this fight's too big for you go back home gohe close close the board up you can't play this game but it's fear we get the fear in our life and we lose the the the fear blurs our vision of our King he's sitting there on the board he's dying to move he's dying to move God wants to move for you in more ways than you can ever imagine more ways than you can imagine or you could be this little guy up here in this in this in this painting lost lost because he couldn't see what he had we so often we Lo lose the vision of what we have we we lose the vision of what God's done for us you know that's that's one thing that always baffled me about the children of Israel I was gay LAX Virginia last night this Lord put this on my heart as the children of Israel they they God brought them out they were in Egypt and they and they they watched all all the plagues that God did for them brought upon on the Egyptians they saw all that they they they heard the cries as as God took the life of the the firstborns of Egypt they seen how God saved their firstborn under the blood of the token they come to the Red Sea they watch God part the Red Sea this is their King in action this is their King moving all over the board for themen they get in the wilderness they're hungry God feeds them drops Man Out Of Heaven drops Quail Out of Heaven you know I'd say that brother Jim after about 14 15 years they look down them shoes still look brand new their garments still look brand new God's doing it all and every time another problem would come up they forgot about what he did for him yesterday that's right how is that not faith building that's what bothered me so much is how is not all these things not building their faith how can they look at all that God is doing and still worry right complain doubt yeah we' we've seen each everybody in here if you could stand up one at a time you could tell something God's done in your life some of you even Supernatural seing God do things in your life give you healing change the situation for you my son's going to get get mad at me cuz I haven't talked about him in a while but if if you never heard it I'm going to tell you the story about God healing his eyes he was four years old his eyes crossed both of them we brought him on brother Lance prayed for him one one time and then I think maybe a year later brother Donny prayed for him four years old he was 20 years old and he was sitting up there at College 1 in the morning took his glasses off and as soon as he took them off his eyes crossed and he said he sat down on the bed and he said Lord I'm sick of this I'm sick of this you've got to get sick of your enemy amen you've got to get tired of losing yeah you've got to be tired of that big goose egg in the wind column oh yeah yes sir and he said I just sat there and I prayed Lord just take this away he said he put his hand up in front of his eyes and he saw two hands when you're crosseyed one hand looks two he said and he prayed put that hand up there and there was two hands and he said he watched as those two hands became War one never ever wore glasses again perfect vision never wor contacts but he had a king that he trusted yeah he had a king that he believed in he said Lord I'm backed into this corner and I'm sick of it we've got to get to the point that we're sick right of where we're at in this game if you don't see yourself advancing you don't see yourself pulling more enemy pieces off the board where are you at in your life ask yourself where are you at in your spiritual walk where has this game taken you are you frustrated because I guarantee if I played brother Robert some of these other guys' chest I'd be frustrated and that's what happens we get to a point we're frustrated we don't know what to do and we've been given the answer all along use the king use the king it's the greatest thing you could ever use if you want to hammer a nail in you grab a tape measure grab a hammer you have an enemy giving you problem what do you use use your king thank you Revelation I'm G read this again and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and 4 and20 Elders fell down before the lamb and every one of them Harps and golden vials full of voters which are the prayer of the Saints they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood of every Kindred tongue and people of the nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign that's the outcome of you winning the game you shall reign on the earth you should be reigning right now yeah there shouldn't be one thing that hell has against you that you can't overcome you've been given everything that you need to overcome that's right you and you get reminded weekly and it shouldn't be weekly you should be reminding yourself every morning when you wake up yeah you should be reminding yourself when you go through your day you should remind yourself when you come home you should remind yourself when you lay down at night and then repeat amen that's how you play the game yes sir that's how you overcome because he is a worthy at adversary but he's no match for your king you know look at the moves when you think you know when when you have to make a move and you think well I I'll get in I'm get in trouble if I do that I don't I don't know if I should do that you know God's leading you to do something you better do it if you feel like God is leading you to make a move you better make a move amen don't consider your own feelings don't consider your own thoughts you know like I told somebody before there's a difference a lot of times people feel led to do something it's it's something they want to do really bad just because you have a great great desire to do something doesn't mean it's God leading you sometimes it's the opposite it sometimes God's leading you to do something and to get there you got to fight that's the way he works I don't know why am I happy about it not really try being called to preach sometime I don't I don't enjoy it I've never I've had people ask me you know does it ever get the nervousness get any better never never and I told Brother Jimmy W ago I said I pray it never does get any better pray it never does the worst feeling that the worst feeling to have in the world and I hope to God it never leaves because that will keep you humble that will keep you humble to the point when you know you're walking out here and you're going to handle the word for somebody and somebody's soul is resting on that and it's in your hands for what you say Christ when Christ played the game look at the moves he made he knew when he made a move it was going to get him beat he did it anyway he know it was going to get his beard plucked out and he did it anyway he made Moves that got him hung on a cross got a spear in his side got him beat he made that move so you wouldn't have to he made it so you wouldn't have to that was the price that he was willing to pay hey I I'll give myself up for this part of the game but hey this game ain't over that's why Satan thought he'd won that's why he said Checkmate the king is now helpless he's useless I killed him and he thought it was over Satan thought the game was over yeah and then he heard a knock hey I got got some more moves I've got more moves I ain't done Satan went to go get a drink of water and do a Victory lap and he heard heard a knock this game ain't over the game as long as there's a king the game's never over I hope we never never forget that brother Bram said broken sisters I'm looking at a man now sitting in the back here I remember telling him that in an Old Barn stall One Day by a Manger he said but I'm no good he said I know you're not I said I'm not either but he said you're looking at what you are quit looking at what you are and look at what he is quit looking at what you are you're a horrible chest player you stink at chess that's just the way it is I do too I ain't no good at it but I'm not looking at my ability I I'm looking at the grandmas yeah that's who I'm looking at you don't look at your own abilities I I've got this in my life I got that in my life quit looking at that yeah look at the one that can take that away we we we're looking too too much at ourselves and then some people are totally off the opposite of that look how great I am look at me look at me everybody pH me on Facebook 40 times a week you can look at me how good I am you stink at chest just like the rest of us amen everybody in here but it's not you playing it's the one inside you playing that's the king in here I I hope I hope this is is is getting through and I know it's simple it ain't deep I'm never I'm never deep so I know I got a lot of quotes in that but it's just a just the way it is though I speak this is mighty conqueror though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not love I am nothing but become as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol though I have love to move mountains and have not and have not love I am nothing I I have power to move mountains and have not love I am nothing so if we're going to play this game as we would call it if we're going to win we've got to get back to the winning principle all these great signs and wonders that we've seen to God we give praise but if those things isn't built upon Godly Christian love and respects for God and his people it'll fail in other words you got to play the game right yes you got to play it the way God intended you got to give the glory to God not yourself just because you you prayed for somebody and they got well you you shouldn't get the glory you ain't the one that made him well you ain't the one that healed him it was God just CU you preached a a message in in 400 people came to the altar you don't go sing your own Praises that was God clearing the board that was nothing you done why because you're supposed to get yourself out of the way anyways it's not you it's the king amen what's the littlest piece on there is that a rook Pawn you're smaller than that so am I we don't even belong on the board but it's his grace that put you there God will always get Glory you know when I studying this and you know thinking God always get glory for everything thing even in this game of life it's not you that wins it and I got to thinking of the blind man blind barus and as Jesus passed by he saw a man who was blind from birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and Jesus said neither hath sinned nor this man nor his parents but the works of God should be made manifest you know I got to thinking about that that God arranged the board in this man's life he was born defeated it looked like yeah born defeated blind and you know and they thought well somebody had sinned either he him or his parents and we we look at things in our life we think this thing is going wrong because I've done this or because I've done that that's the Enemy talking to you I've done this so God's punishing me for this if it's something you ask for forgiveness from God don't see it no more so it was they were looking as God Who had who had Sinn him or his his parents and Jesus had neither this is so that that the works of God should be made manifested in him that's so the God would receive Glory that's what it's all about is God receiving Glory it's not about you and I this whole thing that we're in it's about God yes you know we're we're so close to to the end and we've got I just I don't know how to say this there's so many things H you know I believe we're trying to get make a Rapture I believe with all my heart the messages that we've been hearing of forgiveness and getting um nothing between you and a brother your sisters nothing between that and I believe we're getting a point for in a Rapture in in in in this body you can't have nothing between you and God God if I would ask you raise your hand who who wants something between you and God nobody but we we have things between each other we pit the game against each other God's going to take the bride out as a body and he can't do that till all that's laid aside anything you have against the brother or sister until that's laid aside you're going to remain in this game on and on and on when the bride recognizes who she is that's a body move that's not me recognizing I'm bride that's not me recognizing hey I'm winning this game brother Jackie's winning the game brother Rob's winning the game it's not that it's when the bride gets to the point to realize I've won this game now I know who I am that's that's when you get the trophy Lord that's when you get the the final the Rapture it's it's not it's not about just you playing we've got to help each other yeah and we can't do that when we got these things in between us let's stand together I hope what what I said has made sense to you tonight yes amen you know I I didn't I don't know that you truly got it the way I did but I I hope so when you look at it it's it's not about it's not about us anymore it's about God it's about your king you know we we sing all these songs of Grace what he's done for us the mercy that he's done to to us I was talking to a brother I had lunch with a brother today he's talking about all the I said there's you know everybody that everybody here has got things in their life that you don't want nobody to know about you don't want nobody to know about you got and but you think of God's grace that brought you over that that brought you you know if they put every one of our sins on the on the screen this tonight we'd all leave embarrassed but it was his grace he said let me play the game for you you because you're going to get worse you're going to get worse but you got to get to a point where you have faith you got to move God by faith it's it's not your own abilities you have none we have no abilities if you could tell me anybody in here can tell me one ability that you have that God needs one human ability that you have or anybody has that God is really dying to use comes down to one thing he just loves you so much that's why he keeps us around he don't need us he don't need us to do anything he needs us to love him back we we can't comprehend God's love is it always amazed me you know when the Bible says you know that that you know no greater love than a man laid down his life for his brother there's no greater love but there was a different love there was a love that we can't comprehend and that was when a God took his own son and killed him for you we a there ain't a dad in here to take your son and kill him for anybody because you don't understand that kind of love that's how God loves you that's why he's willing to move these pieces for you you just got to trust him got to have faith it doesn't matter if it's cancer it doesn't matter you you can come in here and criticize and be a critical spirit all you want to it doesn't matter matter it doesn't matter you're not going to change God no you're not going to change the holy spirit amen you might grieve him but he'll never lose power it's power hits I pray that something was said that would help you tonight if you have a need on your heart I want us to to pray for you Heavenly Father Lord I pray I said something Lord that would anchor in someone's heart even if it's just one Lord how Mighty you are how wonderful you are how powerful you are Lord Lord if we ever can get to the point and realize what all you want to do for us Lord and we can look at the things you have done for us and Lord let it build our faith realizing that you are in control Lord Lord we love you we thank you I pray that if there's anyone here father that that needs you that doesn't have you father that
