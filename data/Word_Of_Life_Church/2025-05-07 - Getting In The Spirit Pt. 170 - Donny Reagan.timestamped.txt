[38:44] lamb. Hallelujah.
[38:49] Praise the Lord.
[38:52] How many believes
[38:53] that? How many also
[38:56] believes that that worthy
[38:59] lamb spoke to part of
[39:02] his church age people that were
[39:06] redeemed and he said to
[39:09] them, "You are worthy." Amen. You shall
[39:13] walk with me in white for you are
[39:17] worthy. There's only one way that's
[39:20] possible is that the worthy one made you
[39:23] worthy. That's right.
[39:26] So, I ask you, brothers, if your wife
[39:28] um she's broken down on the side of the
[39:31] road and you have to go get her,
[39:34] inconvenience yourself, take off your
[39:37] work,
[39:39] uh lose a little bit of time, maybe even
[39:41] lose a little bit of
[39:43] money. Are you going to torment her the
[39:45] rest of her life?
[39:49] Or do you think she's worthy of such
[39:51] love? Yes.
[39:54] One of these days before we go on the
[39:58] rapture, I believe the bride will
[40:00] eventually get to the place to where
[40:03] she'll be able to
[40:04] realize she is not the church.
[40:09] And she will be birthed into an
[40:13] understanding that he gave her this
[40:16] grace. That's right. He gave her this
[40:20] mercy. Amen.
[40:22] He gave her this love
[40:25] and he deems her worthy of it. Not
[40:28] within herself, but because he made us
[40:31] worthy. There's such a great difference
[40:33] between true
[40:35] humility and Satan hiding himself behind
[40:39] what people think is
[40:42] humility. And it actually makes us as
[40:45] Christians rob the Lord Jesus of what
[40:48] he's done for us.
[40:50] I don't mind telling you if Carol said
[40:52] that to me every day. Donnie, I'm not
[40:54] worthy to sleep in the same bed as you.
[40:57] I'm not worthy to live in the same
[40:59] house. I'm not worthy to ride in the
[41:01] same car. I'm not worthy to drive in
[41:04] your truck. Let me ride in the
[41:07] back. I'm not worthy to eat with you.
[41:10] Whenever we go out to eat, I'll sit at
[41:12] another
[41:13] table. I'm a very patient man. But if
[41:17] she did that for a couple of days, I'm
[41:18] going to say, "Woman, what is wrong with
[41:21] you?" I mean, we've been married, you
[41:24] know, since back in Noah's day almost.
[41:26] What do you mean you're not worthy?
[41:28] Haven't I proven how much I love you?
[41:31] How much I care for you?
[41:34] What more does he have to do?
[41:37] What more does he have to do? Amen. I
[41:40] don't know how you feel about it. He
[41:42] don't have to do anything else more for
[41:43] me. I just want to receive what he says.
[41:46] Amen. Amen. He has made us worthy. We
[41:50] are recipients of his grace because he
[41:53] deemed it so.
[41:56] Praise the Lord. And the church said,
[41:58] "Amen." And the church says, "Help me,
[42:00] Lord. Help me, Lord. Help me, Lord.
[42:03] Amen." Let's turn to Genesis chapter 24
[42:06] tonight if you would. Ain't it good to
[42:08] be in the house of the Lord? Amen. What
[42:10] a great privilege it is for us once
[42:12] again to be assembled together on
[42:14] Wednesday night and to be able to
[42:16] worship and sing and pray and praise and
[42:19] hear his word.
[42:21] And it's just such a great opportunity
[42:24] every time we get to come together.
[42:28] And the man wondering at her held his
[42:32] peace to wit whether the Lord had made
[42:35] his
[42:36] journey prosperous or not. And it came
[42:40] to pass as the camels had done drinking
[42:42] that the man took a golden earring of
[42:45] half a shekele weight and two bracelets
[42:48] for her hands of 10 shekels weight of
[42:53] gold and said, "Whose daughter art thou?
[42:56] Tell me, I pray thee, is a room in thy
[42:59] father's house for us to lodge in? And
[43:02] she said unto him, I am the daughter of
[43:04] Bethule, the son of Mila, which she bare
[43:08] unto
[43:11] Nahor. She said, Moreover, unto him we
[43:15] have both straw and proender enough and
[43:20] room to lodge in. So, you're more than
[43:24] welcome to come into our
[43:26] place and bring us your message.
[43:31] Amen.
[43:34] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[43:38] So, we open up our home, our lives, our
[43:42] church for your
[43:45] message. Rebecca knew he must have a
[43:48] message.
[43:49] He isn't just there handing out gifts
[43:51] just for no
[43:53] cause. So she said, "We got room. We
[43:57] have room." Yes, we have room. She said,
[44:01] "Moreover, unto him we have both straw
[44:03] and proender enough and room to lodge
[44:07] in."
[44:09] And the man, I love this. The man bowed
[44:14] down his
[44:16] head and said, "What a great servant I
[44:20] am. I am I am such a great guy." That
[44:25] this woman recognized how great I was.
[44:31] No, this was a true servant
[44:33] and he bowed down his
[44:35] head and worshiped.
[44:38] the Lord.
[44:42] I trust every one of us as servants to
[44:45] the economy of God will be able to do
[44:48] the same. Not only when we get there,
[44:51] but in the transit that we're in right
[44:54] now, if anything good comes out of our
[44:57] lives, that we will be able to say, "The
[45:00] Lord did it." That's right. The Lord did
[45:03] it. And the Lord just simply gave me
[45:06] strength to do what he called me to do.
[45:09] And then we will in turn worship the
[45:13] Lord. How many like to be remembered
[45:15] tonight as we
[45:17] pray? Have u several prayer clause here
[45:20] tonight and the Lord is mindful of these
[45:24] needs. So let's let's pray together.
[45:29] Heavenly Father,
[45:31] we are indeed grateful that we can bow
[45:35] our
[45:36] heads as Elear did so many thousands of
[45:40] years
[45:41] ago and worshiped the Lord.
[45:46] This is very sacred to me tonight, Lord.
[45:50] Because when I first come to
[45:53] you, I bowed my head and worshiped the
[46:00] Lord's. I would pray to God the Father,
[46:03] and then I'd pray to Jesus the Son, and
[46:06] then I'd pray to the Holy Ghost.
[46:10] I'm sorry I was so
[46:12] ignorant. But now I bow my
[46:15] head and I worship the one true God.
[46:18] Amen.
[46:21] An idoltor I once was but no
[46:26] more. We thank you for the truth of the
[46:29] word of God that has been restored in
[46:32] the last days.
[46:35] Satan pulled a great trick over the
[46:38] church for many, many hundreds of
[46:40] years and had them in
[46:44] paganism, baptizing
[46:46] entitles, arguing over the deity of the
[46:50] Lord Jesus. Some saying it was God,
[46:52] others saying it was just lesser God. He
[46:56] was only
[46:57] man. But you promised, I will restore,
[47:01] saith the Lord.
[47:03] There's a group of people on the earth,
[47:06] all over the earth
[47:08] actually, that have embraced the
[47:10] original apostolic teaching of water
[47:13] baptism, the correct understanding of
[47:16] the godhead, the deity of our
[47:19] Lord. We're so grateful to be a part of
[47:22] that tonight,
[47:23] Jesus. Father, you see these prayer
[47:25] claws that I have in my hands. I'm
[47:27] asking you, Lord, that you'd be mindful.
[47:31] Dear God, you see this sister, Lord, the
[47:34] report that she got this week and we're
[47:37] asking you for your mercy. Oh, may the
[47:40] hand of God just be with her, Lord.
[47:43] Father, for this other brother, you see
[47:46] this problem in his legs, his feet in
[47:50] the name of Jesus. May the spirit of God
[47:52] move for him.
[47:54] Then Lord, many hands are uplifted here
[47:57] tonight, signifying a need, a desire, a
[48:00] request. We pray that you'd be mindful
[48:02] of each of them. Help me tonight, Lord,
[48:05] that I can get out of the way. Speak
[48:07] through me the words of life to your
[48:10] children. In the name of the Lord Jesus,
[48:13] we ask it. And the saints of God said,
[48:16] "Amen." Amen. God bless you. You may be
[48:19] seated.
[48:21] Let's read now tonight as we start from
[48:25] um a sermon that the prophet
[48:29] entitled the
[48:31] evening
[48:33] messenger. The
[48:35] evening messenger, Mesa,
[48:39] Arizona, January the
[48:41] 16th, 1963.
[48:45] Now, as I read this quote tonight, and I
[48:47] read from the place in Genesis that
[48:50] we've read from, it is very special to
[48:53] me. It's very, very special to me. But I
[48:58] honestly cannot
[49:01] imagine how when brother Brandham read
[49:04] the same scriptures that you and I have
[49:08] read, how much different brother Malachi
[49:11] must have felt for him. Because when he
[49:15] would read Genesis 24 and he would read
[49:19] about the servant sent from
[49:23] Abraham sent to get a bride for
[49:26] Isaac. It was different for him than it
[49:30] would be me reading it to you. It would
[49:33] be different than you reading it
[49:36] yourself.
[49:37] You imagine when he read that, when the
[49:40] spirit of God told him or whenever he
[49:43] was trying to find a place in the word
[49:46] and he said, 'Lord, if if there's
[49:49] somewhere someone in the Bible has been
[49:52] like me or I I I'm to be like them, then
[49:56] Lord, please let me be able to find it.
[50:01] and he opens his Bible and it opens up
[50:05] in Genesis
[50:07] 24, the model servant,
[50:12] Eleazar. Now, there's something about it
[50:15] when we can read the word and actually
[50:19] see ourselves in it. Now, if we're
[50:22] looking at it realistically tonight,
[50:24] none of us are going to see
[50:28] ourselves in the type of the model
[50:31] servant. But I do hope and pray by the
[50:35] grace of God, you do see yourself when
[50:38] you read about Rebecca, right? Because
[50:41] if we don't, we will never be identified
[50:46] in the catching away what we call the
[50:49] rapture. We must see ourself in the word
[50:54] for that proper identification to
[50:57] release to us the faith that we need to
[51:01] change these bodies. No, whenever we
[51:05] read this now when brother Brandon was
[51:07] talking about the evening messenger or
[51:09] now again you and I quote the title of
[51:12] this sermon and we've listened to it no
[51:14] doubt all of you have and whenever we
[51:17] listen to it brother Harvey you've
[51:19] listened to it many times you might even
[51:20] been there when he preached it but
[51:22] whenever we listen to it or read the
[51:26] title I I think of someone of course
[51:29] whenever I quote from this sermon the
[51:32] evening messenger. I don't just think of
[51:35] randomly this man, that man, that man,
[51:38] that man, that man. No. No. Whenever I
[51:41] quote this title, I think of one man in
[51:45] particular because he did not say the
[51:49] evening messengers cuz there ain't a
[51:52] bunch. That's right. There's only one.
[51:55] Out from under that one will come others
[51:59] who will be faithful to what he taught.
[52:02] And they're simply repeating what he
[52:05] said. And the church said, but can you
[52:09] imagine now whenever he stood there in
[52:12] Mesa and takes this reads this scripture
[52:15] and takes for a text from the what he
[52:18] read and then gives it this title and
[52:22] was titling
[52:24] it about himself,
[52:27] the evening messenger. But now he
[52:31] doesn't go in there and actually tell
[52:33] the people. Now look everybody, you all
[52:36] do know, don't you? You do know who I'm
[52:40] talking about
[52:41] tonight that I'm talking about
[52:44] me. No, he didn't say that. Amen. You
[52:48] see, he wants to lay it out in the word
[52:52] and then let those who have seed life be
[52:56] able to identify who it is.
[53:00] No doubt many of them sitting there in
[53:02] the service they didn't have a clue once
[53:04] he got done once he read the scripture
[53:07] once he entitled it they still didn't
[53:09] know they might have thought in their
[53:11] mind well maybe it's aa Allen maybe it
[53:15] was Jack Cole maybe it was this man it
[53:19] was that man some of them probably saw
[53:21] that little Kentucky guy standing up
[53:23] there brother John and
[53:25] thought that's
[53:27] him that's that man up there.
[53:32] That's him. Because nobody's got a
[53:34] message quite like quite like him.
[53:38] Now listen what this man, this
[53:41] messenger said about this in paragraph
[53:44] 247. Look at the little
[53:48] Rebecca listening to every word. Her
[53:52] little heart was beating and he was
[53:56] telling her, "Now you've sweated it out.
[54:00] Where will I go until I find the
[54:03] character?" Now remember, as he's saying
[54:06] these words, he could identify himself
[54:11] because he's in a position unlike me or
[54:15] any other messenger of this message. He
[54:19] was sent by God to be able to bring this
[54:24] message. Now, out of his ministry, God
[54:27] caused revival to strike over the earth.
[54:33] Can you say amen to that? Now, I know
[54:36] there's many men that claim that, but
[54:39] that's not the prophecy of the end time.
[54:42] That was to come from one prophet
[54:46] messenger. Now, watch. So he says,
[54:48] "You've sweated it out. Where will I
[54:53] go until I find the character?" Now
[54:59] imagine speaking this in the first
[55:03] person, but also speaking it in the type
[55:07] in the third person. So he's jumping
[55:10] back and forth from El Ezer to himself.
[55:16] Now what she said, then when I find the
[55:21] character, then make her stand still
[55:25] long enough to get her ready to go meet
[55:31] him. Oh my, what a striking thing. Wish
[55:36] we had a little more time on that clock.
[55:40] Get her ready. stand still to listen to
[55:44] his message of him. Eleazar wasn't
[55:51] speaking of
[55:53] himself, but he was speaking of the one
[55:58] he was sent from. Now, this is one good
[56:01] way that you and I can be able to
[56:04] identify any true messenger from God.
[56:08] Whether he's a prophet, whether he's an
[56:10] evangelist, a teacher, a pastor,
[56:14] apostle, whatever he claims to be, see
[56:17] who and what his message is about. is
[56:22] the bottom line wind up pointing toward
[56:26] him and how great he is and how he's got
[56:31] this and got that and got the other and
[56:34] how notable and how wonderful and so on
[56:37] and so on and so on. It doesn't really
[56:41] take a lot of discernment, but listen to
[56:45] the focal point of where his message is
[56:49] going to. Now I read I read a quote
[56:52] today where brother Brandham said that a
[56:55] person that would be able to have signs
[56:59] and wonders and miracles and he said
[57:01] that faith doesn't always come from a
[57:06] spiritual heart which is quite
[57:10] astounding. Be certain of God 1959 that
[57:13] faith doesn't always come from a
[57:17] spiritual heart. And then he quotes
[57:20] Matthew 24, how that there will be
[57:22] people that will stand and say, I've
[57:24] done signs and wonders in your name. Now
[57:27] watch. He said, Eleazar wasn't speaking
[57:30] of himself, but he was speaking of the
[57:33] one he was sent from, and he had the
[57:37] gifts to prove that he was sent from
[57:41] him.
[57:43] Now notice, he's speaking twofold.
[57:48] He's speaking of Eleazar in Genesis 24,
[57:52] but he's speaking of himself in Malachi
[57:55] 4. So Rebecca would be able to identify
[58:00] this messenger by the gifts that he had.
[58:05] But I want you to notice that she does
[58:08] not move after the manifestation of the
[58:12] gifts.
[58:14] She moves by a different
[58:17] pulsation than that of her
[58:21] brother. Her brother moves by
[58:25] sight. She moves by
[58:29] revelation. Her brother moves by a
[58:32] selfish motive. What he can see. But
[58:37] Rebecca moved by something totally
[58:40] different. Now, she does not make the 60
[58:43] trips up and down to the well and all
[58:46] the things that she did because she saw
[58:49] the gold first. And he dangles the gold
[58:53] before her and her, oh my, a woman of
[58:57] faith and felt a
[59:00] pulsation similar to what Abraham felt
[59:03] when God appeared to him. But she did
[59:06] not know that because Abraham had not
[59:10] been around to teach her that she was
[59:12] born after Abraham left. So what she
[59:18] experienced was the same type of
[59:21] revelatory faith that Abraham had. Now
[59:25] that's the kind of daughter-in-law that
[59:27] you want. One that will be able to walk
[59:31] by the pulsation of faith. Now remember
[59:33] the prophet tells us that Satan will
[59:36] exalt the knowledge of the revelation
[59:40] above the revelation itself. Now this is
[59:43] the danger for many of the message
[59:46] followers now because the message has
[59:49] been around for so many years that many
[59:52] have the knowledge of the revelation and
[59:57] they think because they have the
[59:59] knowledge of the revelation that it's
[1:00:02] revelation to them. You see that's
[1:00:04] what's happened in the last few years of
[1:00:06] those who have pulled away from the
[1:00:08] message. They believed that they
[1:00:11] received a revelation. So they were
[1:00:13] Baptist, Methodist, Church of Christ,
[1:00:15] Church of God, Catholic, whatever they
[1:00:17] were. And someone gave them a book or a
[1:00:19] tape or begin to witness to them. And
[1:00:22] something moved them upon them and they
[1:00:24] thought, "Oh my goodness, this is
[1:00:26] wonderful." And they talked to them
[1:00:27] about the serpent seed or the Godhead or
[1:00:29] water baptism, whatever it was. And a
[1:00:32] little bit of light struck to pass. And
[1:00:34] they thought they had received a
[1:00:37] revelation of the message. But for many
[1:00:39] of them, all they received was the
[1:00:42] knowledge of the revelation from that
[1:00:45] person who witnessed to them. And they
[1:00:49] took that knowledge
[1:00:51] secondhanded and then someone else years
[1:00:54] later talked him out of it.
[1:00:57] But you see, if it's ever revealed to
[1:01:00] you, there ain't enough YouTube videos.
[1:01:04] There ain't enough lots and lots wives
[1:01:07] and everybody else ever talked you out
[1:01:09] of it because nobody else talked you
[1:01:12] into it. But God revealed it to you on a
[1:01:16] firsthand basis. So that's why every son
[1:01:20] and daughter of God is first generation.
[1:01:24] You realize we are not great great great
[1:01:26] great great great great great great
[1:01:27] great great great great great great
[1:01:28] great great great great great great
[1:01:30] great grandchildren of God but we are
[1:01:33] children of God just like Peter was on
[1:01:36] the day of Pentecost is that right
[1:01:40] now watch he says that wasn't speaking
[1:01:43] of himself but he was speaking of the
[1:01:45] one sent him and he had the gifts to
[1:01:47] prove that he was sent from him amen he
[1:01:50] wanted to close her with these things.
[1:01:55] You know how he fixed her up. Now watch
[1:01:58] again in verse 25. She said, "Moreover,
[1:02:01] unto him we have both straw and proender
[1:02:04] and up and room to lodge in." And the
[1:02:06] man bowed his head and worship the Lord.
[1:02:10] Now to show a deep sense of appreciation
[1:02:14] of the divine goodness and mercy of God.
[1:02:18] Notice how this man is so linked to the
[1:02:22] power of almighty God. Now he doesn't
[1:02:25] bow his head and give thanks to Abraham.
[1:02:29] He does not bow his head and say what a
[1:02:32] great man Isaac was, but he bows his
[1:02:36] head and gives thanks to Almighty God.
[1:02:40] Now you see those of us who have a
[1:02:42] correct understanding of the message of
[1:02:45] Malachi 4, we understand that God sent a
[1:02:50] prophet, but we do not worship him.
[1:02:54] We do not deify the man. Word of life
[1:02:58] said, we do not deify the man. Praise
[1:03:03] the Lord. We thank God that God sent him
[1:03:06] to us. Is that right? But we bow our
[1:03:10] heads and thank God for sending Malachi
[1:03:13] forward to us.
[1:03:15] But he was not our God. He was not our
[1:03:18] redeemer. He was not our savior. He was
[1:03:22] our brother. Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh,
[1:03:26] thank God. Aren't you glad we have that
[1:03:28] balanced tonight? You'd be surprised how
[1:03:30] many people don't. And the man bowed his
[1:03:32] head and he worshiped the Lord. So he
[1:03:36] realizes where this has coming from and
[1:03:39] prayer. What is prayer? It's an
[1:03:41] acknowledgment of the favors that he
[1:03:43] received of the divine mercy of almighty
[1:03:46] God. So we worship the Lord and he give
[1:03:49] him thanks for prospering his journey
[1:03:52] hoping and believing that a further
[1:03:55] unfolding of this will take place as the
[1:03:59] events of the day unfold theirel. Now
[1:04:02] listen to me. every event that's fixing
[1:04:05] to transpire, he is watching Rebecca.
[1:04:09] These things are being set up by the
[1:04:11] divine sovereignty of God. And this
[1:04:14] messenger is watching and going to watch
[1:04:17] her reaction to further identify her
[1:04:21] that she is truly the bride. So just
[1:04:25] initially was not enough. She has to
[1:04:28] respond. She's got to say the right
[1:04:30] things. She's got to have the right
[1:04:32] behavior. So, oh my, don't you
[1:04:34] understand why the Lord's watching us
[1:04:36] every day of our life? Notice in verse
[1:04:38] 27, he said, "Blessed be the Lord
[1:04:42] God of my master Abraham, who hath not
[1:04:47] left destitute my master of his mercy
[1:04:52] and his truth. Our being in the way, the
[1:04:56] capital L, capital O, capital R, capital
[1:04:59] D, led me to the house of my master's
[1:05:04] brethren. Notice he says it over and
[1:05:07] over and over again. My master. My
[1:05:12] master. My master. Now you imagine
[1:05:16] Rebecca. She is also listening to how
[1:05:20] this man is talking. She never met him
[1:05:23] before, a 16-year-old girl. And she
[1:05:27] doesn't maybe know it yet, but he knows
[1:05:29] if she responds in the right way, he's
[1:05:32] going to take her back several hundred
[1:05:35] miles from her home. She will never
[1:05:39] return again. She will never see her
[1:05:43] mother again. She will never see her
[1:05:46] brother, her father, her relatives
[1:05:50] again.
[1:05:51] So you imagine that she's listening with
[1:05:54] all the sincerity of her heart. If this
[1:05:58] man would have be to talk about how
[1:06:00] great he was and wonderful he was, you
[1:06:02] imagine she'd had an issue. Amen. And if
[1:06:05] you don't, there's something wrong with
[1:06:06] you. That's right. Now notice he goes on
[1:06:09] to say in verse 28, "And the
[1:06:13] damsel
[1:06:14] ran and told them of her mother's house
[1:06:19] these things." And Rebecca had a
[1:06:24] brother, and his name was Laban. And
[1:06:29] Laban ran out unto the man unto the
[1:06:33] well. Now remember this man, we will see
[1:06:37] him again. Jacob meets him many years
[1:06:40] later. And everybody remembers old
[1:06:42] brother Laban, don't we? Uh probably all
[1:06:45] of us have got a brother or daddy or an
[1:06:47] uncle or a grandpa or a cousin or
[1:06:49] somebody like old brother Laban and
[1:06:51] they've got their own good in mind and
[1:06:54] they don't mind who they have to use to
[1:06:55] get it. Well, come on somebody. Now what
[1:06:58] you notice in the cannon of scripture
[1:07:01] here that her father's name is not
[1:07:03] mentioned. Her father is no longer
[1:07:06] mentioned as the head of the family. So
[1:07:09] now according to Josephus and some other
[1:07:12] historians that he was quite aged now
[1:07:15] and Laban was actually going to be the
[1:07:18] spokesman for the family. So, Laban ran
[1:07:21] out of the house and out of the city of
[1:07:25] Haran and he goes to now to where the
[1:07:29] man is. Now, there's something that is
[1:07:32] motivating Laban that is totally
[1:07:34] different than the motivation that
[1:07:36] Rebecca got. So, this is after Rebecca
[1:07:40] goes home and she relates the story. But
[1:07:44] remember, Laban is not the same type of
[1:07:47] person that she is. even though they've
[1:07:50] got the same mother and the same father.
[1:07:53] And it came to pass when he saw
[1:08:02] the earring and
[1:08:05] bracelets upon his sister's
[1:08:09] hands. Notice his
[1:08:12] response. What is it based on? Sight.
[1:08:16] Uh-huh. So after he
[1:08:20] saw, but Rebecca didn't move after she
[1:08:24] saw. Rebecca moved after she heard.
[1:08:28] Faith don't come by seeing. Faith comes
[1:08:32] by hearing. Well, praise the Lord. You
[1:08:36] see, those who leave the message, don't
[1:08:38] you understand how it starts with them
[1:08:42] seeing something? So someone on YouTube
[1:08:45] or a friend of theirs said, "Oh, let me
[1:08:47] show you this." Brother Ram said this,
[1:08:48] "Sure." And he said it there. "Yeah, he
[1:08:50] was a human being like you and I." Uh,
[1:08:52] come on, somebody. And did did he tell
[1:08:55] this story one way and tell another?
[1:08:57] Sure. Just like most of you do the same
[1:08:59] thing. Anybody here got a 100% recall?
[1:09:04] It'd be interesting to see how many
[1:09:06] hundreds of people are tonight and you
[1:09:08] would give an eyewitness testimony of
[1:09:12] what I preached in this
[1:09:14] service. It would be amazing to hear how
[1:09:17] many different versions it would be. as
[1:09:21] I preached the sermon several years ago
[1:09:23] at the other church and brother Jim Bab
[1:09:27] received a phone call from someone and
[1:09:30] they said in this phone call they left a
[1:09:33] message on the office phone and said uh
[1:09:36] I I heard brother Donnie say that he
[1:09:40] died and that he had been dead for 4
[1:09:44] days and that his nose had fallen in.
[1:09:51] Well, most of you all heard that same
[1:09:53] sermon. Was that what you heard?
[1:09:57] Now, the brother wasn't trying to make
[1:09:59] something up. That's just the way he
[1:10:02] heard it. Well, of course, you knew who
[1:10:05] I was talking about, right? Amen. My
[1:10:08] brother Lazarus.
[1:10:10] But somehow the brother missed this word
[1:10:12] or that word or whatever it was. So he
[1:10:15] he called to ask brother Jim bad, you
[1:10:18] know, did did brother Donnie die? He
[1:10:20] said, I wanted to give this testimony.
[1:10:22] It wasn't a
[1:10:23] testimony. I I I didn't want to give
[1:10:26] this testimony that brother Donnie had
[1:10:28] died and his nose had fell in and he was
[1:10:30] stinking and the Lord raised him up from
[1:10:32] the dead. But you see, it's so easy for
[1:10:36] things to be kind of twisted around.
[1:10:39] Anybody ever get things twisted around?
[1:10:42] But you see, the spirit of God will help
[1:10:44] us and direct us if we will let him.
[1:10:48] Now, you think of what Laban saw versus
[1:10:52] what Rebecca heard. Now, we have no
[1:10:57] scriptural
[1:10:58] reaction once he put the gold on her.
[1:11:02] Now, remember to us this is it don't
[1:11:05] really make any sense, but she knew what
[1:11:09] this meant.
[1:11:11] It was him claiming her
[1:11:15] for Isaac. Her receiving these
[1:11:20] gifts was that she had
[1:11:23] agreed to step one of a betroal.
[1:11:29] Now remember, but not so much by what
[1:11:32] she saw and going around just, oh look,
[1:11:34] look, look, look, look, you know, look
[1:11:36] at the gold, look at the gold. But look
[1:11:38] at the difference between her and her
[1:11:42] brethren. Now watch. And it came to pass
[1:11:45] when he saw the earring and braces from
[1:11:48] his upon his sister hands. And when he
[1:11:50] heard the words of Rebecca, notice
[1:11:54] hearing come after
[1:11:56] seeing. Oh children, can't you
[1:11:58] understand why? I'm trying my best to
[1:12:01] get us to word that we are not sign
[1:12:05] seekers. But signs should follow us, not
[1:12:09] us follow them. We believe in signs, do
[1:12:14] we not? We believe in wonders. We
[1:12:16] believe in miracles. But let's get them
[1:12:18] in their proper place. Let's go by
[1:12:21] hearing first and then we'll see signs.
[1:12:26] Oh my. when he heard the words of
[1:12:28] Rebecca his sister saying thus the man
[1:12:30] spake unto me that he came unto the man
[1:12:34] and behold he stood by the camels at the
[1:12:37] well. So here we see the characteristic
[1:12:40] of Laban but Rebecca showed kindness
[1:12:44] before she saw one thing. She never
[1:12:47] rendered kindness at her. So it's, you
[1:12:50] know, trading you. You did this for me.
[1:12:52] You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
[1:12:54] Then you scratch your my nose, I'll
[1:12:55] scratch yours. But before he done
[1:12:57] anything, she responded because there
[1:13:00] was a reciprocation from the angel of
[1:13:03] God that had already been deposited to
[1:13:06] Rebecca that would make her
[1:13:09] magnetized to this man she had never
[1:13:12] seen before. And it would be an
[1:13:15] invisible something, not to marry him
[1:13:18] now, not to take the place of her
[1:13:21] bridegroom, but simply the message that
[1:13:24] he bore and the gifts that he had.
[1:13:28] Praise be to God. Now, I want you to
[1:13:31] notice that that Nao Lab my oh look at
[1:13:36] his eye now. Is it an eye of pity? Is it
[1:13:40] an eye of love? Is it an eye of mercy?
[1:13:44] It's an eye of greed
[1:13:48] and personal accomplishment and
[1:13:51] benefit. So one thing motivated him to
[1:13:56] offer
[1:13:58] hospitality to this
[1:14:00] stranger. It was after he saw the gifts.
[1:14:05] So he decided to invite brother Brandham
[1:14:08] to his church. I mean, uh, excuse me
[1:14:11] there.
[1:14:13] Yes.
[1:14:14] After the Pentecostals saw the gifts,
[1:14:18] they wanted him to come to their
[1:14:20] churches.
[1:14:23] When he himself said he'd sent over a
[1:14:25] million souls to the Assembly of God
[1:14:30] church, they benefited by Eleer being on
[1:14:35] the earth in this generation.
[1:14:39] But so did I.
[1:14:41] I didn't get just a revival.
[1:14:44] Amen. I got a betroal to the king.
[1:14:49] Praise be to God. Thank you, Lord. You
[1:14:53] see,
[1:14:54] covetousness can make a man
[1:14:58] calculating. It can make him deceptive.
[1:15:03] And that can
[1:15:04] appear to the untaught as generosity.
[1:15:12] People that are looking for nice favors
[1:15:15] and kind words and and people will look
[1:15:18] at it for, oh, he's such a nice man,
[1:15:20] such a nice man. But his response is the
[1:15:24] goal from around her hands.
[1:15:28] He's being so nice and so cordial, but
[1:15:31] he has something in mind. Now notice
[1:15:34] what he says. Come
[1:15:36] in thou blessed of the Lord. Oh, Laban
[1:15:41] got a little bit of religion. Glory to
[1:15:43] God.
[1:15:44] Hallelujah. Come in thy blessed of the
[1:15:49] Lord. Oh my. He looks and sees the sign
[1:15:54] of blessing.
[1:15:57] But I want you to notice
[1:15:59] now
[1:16:00] Eleer picks up something about
[1:16:05] Laban. Because it was not
[1:16:08] customary to give the brother of the
[1:16:12] bride gifts. You see, there was one
[1:16:16] called the Mahar, one called the
[1:16:19] Matan, and you had to divide them. So
[1:16:23] there was a bride price and there was
[1:16:26] the bride's inheritance and it was very
[1:16:29] meticulous and who got what
[1:16:32] gift. So the servant had to be taught
[1:16:36] and who to give what the moar. You see
[1:16:40] the girls did not receive an inheritance
[1:16:43] like the boys did. So the father would
[1:16:47] give the daughter this gift to take with
[1:16:50] her on her journey. And then the friend
[1:16:53] of the bridegroom, which was Eleazar, he
[1:16:56] had to give her something, but he also
[1:16:59] would pay the bride price. The bride
[1:17:03] price it's called. So he had to know who
[1:17:06] to give it to. But he picks up on Laban
[1:17:10] that if he don't give Laban something,
[1:17:14] he could cause some problems.
[1:17:19] So out there is Pastor Rooster
[1:17:23] Laben and he's out there in the chicken
[1:17:26] yard. Of course, there's this little
[1:17:28] eagle
[1:17:29] Rebecca. And oh, here comes old Pastor
[1:17:32] Laben strutting around like a Rhode
[1:17:34] Island Red in that chicken yard. And
[1:17:38] I'll tell you one thing
[1:17:41] now. We're Trinitarian. We believe in
[1:17:44] this. We don't believe in no
[1:17:48] prophet. So he picks up on him that in
[1:17:51] order to make this
[1:17:53] work, he may actually have to use his
[1:17:57] gift on him.
[1:18:00] Now
[1:18:01] watch. He done picked up by discernment.
[1:18:07] So Eleazar must have had a
[1:18:09] gift except it wasn't a guessing gift.
[1:18:11] It was a true one. Now notice in verse
[1:18:15] 31, and he said, "Come
[1:18:19] in, thou blessed of the
[1:18:22] Lord. Wherefore standest thou without,
[1:18:26] for I have prepared the church, I I mean
[1:18:30] the house, and room for the camels.
[1:18:34] Sure. Bring your tent down here and
[1:18:37] bring your campaign here. We we we want
[1:18:40] to benefit by your blessings and your
[1:18:43] gift and your signs and your wonders,
[1:18:45] but just don't tell about that serpent
[1:18:48] seed. And don't tell us that we've been
[1:18:51] baptized wrong, but come in thou blessed
[1:18:54] of the Lord. Amen.
[1:18:58] Oh my good.
[1:19:00] And the man came into the house and he
[1:19:04] unguarded his camels and gave straw and
[1:19:09] proender for the camels and water to
[1:19:12] wash his feet and the man's feet that
[1:19:16] were with him. Now I want you to notice
[1:19:18] Eleazar is not by himself.
[1:19:24] This is your Bible.
[1:19:27] They're men with him. They are not the
[1:19:31] messenger. That's right. But they're
[1:19:34] traveling with the man who has the
[1:19:36] message. Amen. Praise be to God. Now,
[1:19:40] you would not want to send all this
[1:19:41] gold, all this silver, all these bride
[1:19:44] price, the mohar, the batan, all that.
[1:19:46] You wouldn't want to send that just by
[1:19:48] one man alone because there's a lot of
[1:19:50] thieves along the way. So, you want to
[1:19:52] send men along that can help protect the
[1:19:56] message and the messenger.
[1:19:59] I wouldn't give you a nickel for a man
[1:20:01] who says he believes this message that's
[1:20:04] ashamed to call the messenger's name.
[1:20:06] Get away from such a hypocrite.
[1:20:09] Paul said, "Be not ashamed of me, his
[1:20:12] prisoner." Come on, somebody. I'm not
[1:20:14] ashamed to tell you tonight I'll follow
[1:20:17] a God sent prophet by the name of
[1:20:20] William Mary and Bradom. I ain't ashamed
[1:20:22] of it. I ain't backwards. I ain't
[1:20:25] bashful about it. I am not ashamed. If
[1:20:28] I'd have lived in the days of Noah, I'd
[1:20:30] have said, "My messenger's name is
[1:20:32] Noah." If I lived in the days of Luther,
[1:20:35] I'd have stood right there with Luther,
[1:20:37] Wesley, or whoever more. I live in this
[1:20:40] day and I am not ashamed of the message
[1:20:43] nor the messenger.
[1:20:51] Hallelujah. Oh my. Notice him now. And
[1:20:56] there was set meat before him to eat.
[1:21:00] Notice the
[1:21:01] urgency. But he
[1:21:03] said, I will not eat.
[1:21:09] until I have given my
[1:21:13] message. And he said, "Speak
[1:21:18] on." You'd later regret that, wouldn't
[1:21:21] you, Brother Jack Moore?
[1:21:27] Brother Bram says, "I was standing there
[1:21:29] on the
[1:21:30] phone with a pair of Indian
[1:21:32] moccasinsomes on and white Levi
[1:21:36] trousers when I scheduled this
[1:21:40] meeting." That was the night that he
[1:21:42] preached the invisible union of the
[1:21:44] bride of Christ.
[1:21:47] The next day, Brother Moore and some
[1:21:49] more preachers from the church was
[1:21:51] trying to find Brother Brandham in
[1:21:53] Freeport. The guy downstairs gave him
[1:21:55] the wrong motel room number. They was
[1:21:57] knocking on the door, knocking on the
[1:21:59] door, knocking on the door. And they was
[1:22:01] going to tell brother Brandham he
[1:22:02] couldn't come back that
[1:22:04] night. You remember Invisible Union,
[1:22:07] don't you? Boy, am I glad he preached it
[1:22:09] cuz he never preached it nowhere
[1:22:12] else. Oh, Brother Moore got all upset.
[1:22:15] The preachers got all upset. Other
[1:22:17] people got all upset. It didn't upset
[1:22:20] me. It set me
[1:22:22] up. Well, glory to God. It set me up for
[1:22:26] something like I had never heard in my
[1:22:28] entire life. What was the title of that
[1:22:31] sermon? The invisible union of the bride
[1:22:35] of Christ. It started, my friends, and
[1:22:38] then and there's where he stands in
[1:22:40] those meetings and said, "Thus sayaeth
[1:22:43] the Lord." The move is on for the bride.
[1:22:47] The move is on. Well, let me just tell
[1:22:49] you, it's been going on ever since then,
[1:22:52] too. What kind of move is it? It ain't
[1:22:55] for the world. It ain't for the church,
[1:22:57] but it's for the bride, the end
[1:22:59] gathering of the elect of God. Eleer has
[1:23:03] been here and gone, but the Holy Ghost
[1:23:06] is still here getting a bride ready for
[1:23:10] a rapture to meet the Lord Jesus.
[1:23:14] Oh,
[1:23:16] glory. Yes, sir. You see, this would
[1:23:19] have been customary now for for Laban to
[1:23:23] offer this
[1:23:24] hospitality to his
[1:23:27] guest. But Abraham's servant has such an
[1:23:33] urgency to get the message
[1:23:36] out. And the nature of his message is so
[1:23:40] important that he considers eating
[1:23:48] trivial. Let's turn now to the New
[1:23:51] Testament. Book of John, chapter 3,
[1:23:55] verse 26.
[1:23:58] Let's look at another
[1:24:03] shashabin.
[1:24:05] Shashabin or the Greek word
[1:24:10] paronyymph
[1:24:13] parymph the Hebrew
[1:24:17] shashuin. And they came unto John, and
[1:24:20] said unto him,
[1:24:22] Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond
[1:24:25] Jordan, to whom thou beareest
[1:24:29] witness, behold, the same
[1:24:32] baptizest, and all men come to
[1:24:36] him. Now watch, these are some of John's
[1:24:40] disciples.
[1:24:42] I'm not I don't know if you're aware,
[1:24:44] but this is right before just a few days
[1:24:48] before John is going to be thrown into
[1:24:51] prison. I want you to listen how they
[1:24:54] react. So, these are people that's
[1:24:57] following the prophet's message, but
[1:25:00] they haven't really caught the message.
[1:25:04] Listen, it's their petition now. They're
[1:25:09] jealous. They are so
[1:25:12] jealous for
[1:25:14] John's sake.
[1:25:17] Now watch what they're telling them. So
[1:25:18] they called him Rabbi, which is master
[1:25:21] teacher. They came to John and said to
[1:25:23] him, "Rabbi, he that was with thee
[1:25:25] beyond Jordan," which was the Lord
[1:25:27] Jesus, "to whom thou beest witness,
[1:25:30] saying, Behold the lamb of God," of
[1:25:32] course is what he said. Behold, the same
[1:25:35] baptizes, and all men come to
[1:25:40] him. Now, they are doing this because
[1:25:43] they are
[1:25:45] jealous of John and brother Jim. They
[1:25:47] don't get it. They don't get it that the
[1:25:50] transition time is now
[1:25:53] arrived, but they're going into
[1:25:56] protection mode. So, they're jealous for
[1:26:00] John.
[1:26:03] I hope somebody's hearing me tonight.
[1:26:07] That was at this first advent of Malachi
[1:26:10] 3 when the spirit of Elijah come on a
[1:26:13] man and the spirit of Elijah that was on
[1:26:16] that man said, "Behold the lamb of God."
[1:26:19] And then whenever the transition come to
[1:26:21] the bridegroom himself speaking to the
[1:26:24] bride with his own voice, then those who
[1:26:27] were still following the messengergers's
[1:26:30] flesh, they got so
[1:26:33] jealous. Oh my.
[1:26:36] And they went in protection mode. So
[1:26:40] they're rallying around John now.
[1:26:43] They've come and said, "Master, it's
[1:26:44] it's awful. It's awful. Can't you
[1:26:47] understand, master? We we've come to
[1:26:48] tell you. We hate to tell you, but it's
[1:26:50] awful. What's happened? I said, "Well,
[1:26:51] what is it? What in the world is going
[1:26:53] on?" Well, you know that that Jesus,
[1:26:54] that guy that you said, "Behold the lamb
[1:26:56] of God." He He's out there preaching now
[1:27:00] and he's
[1:27:01] baptizing and all your people are
[1:27:04] following him. Amen. And we're the only
[1:27:07] ones left. Oh, yeah. It's just a few of
[1:27:10] us. And we're the only ones. And we're
[1:27:12] we're trying to rally around you and
[1:27:14] save your position and everything. And
[1:27:16] we hate to tell you, but we just thought
[1:27:18] you'd want to
[1:27:21] know. John answered and
[1:27:25] said, "A man can receive nothing except
[1:27:28] it be given him from
[1:27:32] heaven. Ye
[1:27:35] yourselves bear me witness that I
[1:27:39] said, I am not the Christ." Amen. How
[1:27:45] much planer could it be? You imagine a
[1:27:47] prophet of God having to stand in the
[1:27:49] tabernacle in Jeffersonville and say
[1:27:51] these words. There's a dozen or more
[1:27:54] people sitting here this morning that
[1:27:56] thought I was Jesus Christ.
[1:27:59] Yeah. Now remember when that
[1:28:02] snake which he struck in the middle head
[1:28:06] in Canada tail in Georgia and he stood
[1:28:09] in the middle in the water in
[1:28:12] Jeffersonville and struck it. Then a
[1:28:14] brother turned and said it's okay. It'll
[1:28:17] be fine. And brother Bam turned around
[1:28:19] and that snake crawled in the water.
[1:28:23] Now remember he said that it was such a
[1:28:26] spirit that it bit him
[1:28:33] but the blood was too rich and it
[1:28:36] wouldn't take effect on it. That's
[1:28:38] right. Now is there anybody in this
[1:28:41] church tonight that's wacko enough to
[1:28:44] think you're God?
[1:28:48] Most of you are wondering if you're the
[1:28:50] other
[1:28:53] guy. But can you imagine this man having
[1:28:56] to deal with that spirit because he saw
[1:29:00] Jesus Christ so much in his own life?
[1:29:05] Brothers, have any of your children
[1:29:07] lately thought you was the Lord Jesus?
[1:29:09] What about your girlfriend? What about
[1:29:11] your mama? What about your daddy?
[1:29:14] nieces, nephews, cousins,
[1:29:18] uncles. There must have been something
[1:29:21] pretty great about the ministry of this
[1:29:24] man that people had a hard time knowing
[1:29:26] if it was Jesus or not.
[1:29:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:31] But remember, he told us, "You make me
[1:29:35] out of Christ to make me the person of
[1:29:39] the Lord Jesus." Yes, sir. They sure
[1:29:42] did. But remember, the truth was so
[1:29:45] close.
[1:29:47] They were so right. So close to being
[1:29:51] right.
[1:29:52] This is the
[1:29:53] truth. Can you get it straight now? The
[1:29:57] seventh angel is not the son of man, but
[1:30:02] he's revealing to the public the son of
[1:30:05] man, but the son of man is Christ. Yes.
[1:30:11] Can you get it separated now? It seems
[1:30:14] to be so hard for you. It's evident
[1:30:16] there's a lot of them still ain't got it
[1:30:18] separated because they're still under
[1:30:20] that deity spirit. Well, come on,
[1:30:23] somebody. Friend, you don't know how
[1:30:25] blessed you are tonight to realize what
[1:30:27] God has done and yet not idolize the
[1:30:30] gift of the man that God used to do it.
[1:30:33] Thank you. Oh my. Now John said, "You
[1:30:36] bear me witness that I said I am not the
[1:30:39] Christ, but that I am sent before him."
[1:30:43] All right, John, who are you? Tell us
[1:30:46] your
[1:30:48] mystery. He that hath the
[1:30:51] bride is the bridegroom.
[1:30:55] But the friend of the bridegroom, the
[1:30:58] paronym
[1:31:02] shashbin, the friend of the bridegroom
[1:31:05] which standeth and heareth
[1:31:07] him rejoices
[1:31:11] greatly because of the bridegroom's
[1:31:18] voice. This is my joy.
[1:31:22] Therefore, it's fulfilled.
[1:31:25] And I hear his followers are
[1:31:29] jealous. They're torn to
[1:31:33] pieces. Don't you understand that
[1:31:35] brother Brandon was here and seeing that
[1:31:37] his message had went around the world?
[1:31:40] And to see that many of the message
[1:31:41] preachers are preaching, the preeminent
[1:31:43] one is not a pastor, it's not a teacher,
[1:31:45] it's not an evangelist, it's not even a
[1:31:47] prophet, but the preeminent one in our
[1:31:49] lives, in our church, and our move
[1:31:51] should be Jesus Christ. Can you imagine
[1:31:54] brother Brandham the deacons had
[1:31:56] probably already had to set him down
[1:31:57] here tonight because he never had the
[1:31:59] opportunity to travel around the world
[1:32:01] the way Paul did. Paul was able to start
[1:32:03] a church here and there and there and
[1:32:05] there and there and go back and preach
[1:32:07] in them message churches but brother
[1:32:08] Brandon never had that opportunity. He
[1:32:11] preached in Jeffersonville. He preached
[1:32:12] to the little group in Sarah Vista and
[1:32:14] he preached to the the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:32:17] rather there that brother Perry Grie
[1:32:19] started and he would preach to some of
[1:32:21] the local churches there. Can you
[1:32:23] imagine the prophet of God being able to
[1:32:25] walk into a message church and preach
[1:32:29] the message of the hour? Oh, how blessed
[1:32:33] we are, children. But saying here they
[1:32:36] were, they went into the protection
[1:32:38] mode. And somehow many of the people
[1:32:41] that are bitten by that deity spirit
[1:32:44] think they're protected. Oh my.
[1:32:46] Preachers will mess it up. Preachers
[1:32:47] will mess it up. That's why we just need
[1:32:49] to play the tapes only. That's it.
[1:32:51] That's all we got to protect it.
[1:32:54] Oh, we we just we just we we can't let
[1:32:57] nobody say nothing about it now. And
[1:32:59] been preachers will goof it up. They'll
[1:33:00] mess it up. Preachers always mess up
[1:33:02] everything. They always do. We've got to
[1:33:04] protect
[1:33:08] that. You poor, decrepit, deceived
[1:33:12] individual. That's right. Amen. Come on.
[1:33:15] You don't even believe what them tapes
[1:33:17] say.
[1:33:19] If you did, when you press play, you'd
[1:33:20] hear the prophet of God say, "You
[1:33:22] brothers are messengers of this same
[1:33:25] message that I am." Remember, Brother
[1:33:27] Brandham never come to start something
[1:33:29] new, but to restore our faith back to
[1:33:31] the apostolic fathers.
[1:33:36] My he that hath a bride is the
[1:33:39] bridegroom, but the friend, watch, watch
[1:33:42] John identifying himself. Don't y'all
[1:33:45] see who I am? He said, "I'm the friend
[1:33:49] of the
[1:33:52] bridegroom." The friend of the
[1:33:54] bridegroom which standeth and hearth him
[1:33:57] rejoicth greatly. John was able to hear.
[1:34:00] Praise God. You mean the bridegroom? The
[1:34:03] Lord Jesus. Is that what you're telling
[1:34:05] me? The Lord Jesus is now speaking to
[1:34:08] his bride. Yeah. Yeah. We heard him. We
[1:34:10] heard him. It's awful. It's absolutely
[1:34:12] awful. The Lord Jesus is out there
[1:34:14] preaching. He's filling these people
[1:34:16] with his spirit and he's speaking to
[1:34:18] men, women, boys and girls and he's
[1:34:20] preaching them and they're following him
[1:34:22] and we tried to break up that
[1:34:24] maintenance, get them to come over here
[1:34:25] back. You know, the Bible says on the
[1:34:26] book of Acts that talking about the
[1:34:28] people in that day, they had them that
[1:34:31] preached
[1:34:32] Moses every Sabbath
[1:34:35] day. They're preaching Moses and the
[1:34:39] Lord God had come to the earth. Now, the
[1:34:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost was on the
[1:34:43] earth, and they're still preaching
[1:34:44] Moses.
[1:34:46] Preach, brother. I'm here to tell you
[1:34:49] God sent a prophet, but I'm not here to
[1:34:51] tell you, my friends, that he is the
[1:34:53] way, nor the truth, nor the life. I'm
[1:34:56] here to tell you that's the bridegroom.
[1:34:58] Yes, sir. Oh,
[1:35:00] hallelujah. So, the friend of the
[1:35:04] bridegroom, Shashbin, or Periff. So now
[1:35:08] let me read to you some of the things
[1:35:10] that he's supposed to do. He was charged
[1:35:12] with the
[1:35:14] preliminaries of the marriage. He
[1:35:17] arranged the contract, acted for the
[1:35:21] bridegroom during the betroal and
[1:35:25] arranged for and preided
[1:35:28] at the
[1:35:30] festivities on the wedding day.
[1:35:34] It was a position of
[1:35:37] honor in proportion to the position of
[1:35:40] the bridegroom
[1:35:42] himself. So according to how great the
[1:35:45] bridegroom was, he would select this
[1:35:48] parony and he would give him a place of
[1:35:51] great
[1:35:52] honor cuz it represented the bridegroom.
[1:35:56] So, can you imagine the damnation that
[1:35:58] awaits people that calls our friend or
[1:36:02] the bridegroom a false prophet and a
[1:36:04] liar and deceiver? I'd rather stand
[1:36:06] before God as a drunk, as an
[1:36:09] alcoholic. Come on, somebody. I'd rather
[1:36:12] stand before God as a ranked sinner than
[1:36:14] I would some of these people that have
[1:36:16] sat around this message 20 years, 30
[1:36:19] years, 40 years, and say the foolish
[1:36:22] things they're saying.
[1:36:24] Don't get quiet on me tonight.
[1:36:28] Oh
[1:36:29] my. So the bridegroom calls this man and
[1:36:33] gives him this
[1:36:35] honor. You are my
[1:36:38] friend. Go get me a
[1:36:44] bride. But they won't believe
[1:36:47] me. I ain't got no education. As Moses
[1:36:50] was given three
[1:36:53] signs, so you also will be given
[1:37:03] three. Oh my. He that hath the bride is
[1:37:08] the bridegroom, but the friend of the
[1:37:11] bridegroom which standeth and heareth
[1:37:15] him.
[1:37:17] Can you imagine when brother Brandham
[1:37:19] stood there in 1960 and
[1:37:21] said, "I'm here to tell
[1:37:24] you he's not coming,
[1:37:27] but he's here." Amen.
[1:37:32] My message, he says, is to forerun that
[1:37:36] coming word.
[1:37:40] when he preaches to seals and he refers
[1:37:42] to Malachi 4 and he said I can't say too
[1:37:45] much about it it's just
[1:37:48] arrived spoken words original seed 1962
[1:37:52] he says Malachi 4 is a germatized seed
[1:37:54] word of God it has not yet at this
[1:37:57] time been
[1:38:01] fulfilled
[1:38:03] 1962 then he jumps down his report in
[1:38:05] 1965 and says the Elijah of this
[1:38:10] day is the Lord
[1:38:14] Jesus Christ,
[1:38:18] which can't be, brother Ben.
[1:38:24] As a lightning will come from the east
[1:38:26] unto the west, even so shall it be when
[1:38:29] the Son of Man
[1:38:32] comes. Then shall they see a cloud in
[1:38:36] the heavens,
[1:38:40] In Elijah's day, they saw a cloud like a
[1:38:43] man's
[1:38:44] hand. But we didn't need a man's hand.
[1:38:48] We needed head to come back.
[1:38:51] You imagine all that time after it
[1:38:54] happened out there in Arizona. And one
[1:38:57] day standing in his room, the spirit
[1:38:59] said, 1965, turn it to the right. He
[1:39:02] said, "Well, I think I'm looking at it
[1:39:03] right." And he said, "Turn it to the
[1:39:05] right." And he said, "Maybe he means
[1:39:07] turn the picture to the right." And he
[1:39:09] said, "When I turned it to the right, it
[1:39:12] was Christ in all his glory."
[1:39:16] And you imagine it had happened over two
[1:39:18] years, something like that, and he still
[1:39:20] didn't see who it was. And what was it?
[1:39:24] Hoffman's head of Christ. Not a foot,
[1:39:27] not the upper torso of the body. It was
[1:39:29] not tongues, which would have been a
[1:39:30] Pentecostal message, but it was the
[1:39:33] entirety of the head. The intelligence,
[1:39:36] not the artificial one, but the
[1:39:38] intelligence of Christ had come back to
[1:39:41] the earth. And when was it revealed in
[1:39:43] the form of the head? In n in the rising
[1:39:46] of the sun and in the Easter Seal when
[1:39:48] he goes to preaching it, the last year
[1:39:50] of his ministry. What's happening? The
[1:39:54] friend of the bridegroom, he said, now
[1:39:56] he must
[1:39:57] increase and I will decrease.
[1:40:01] Amen. Amen. But what I find so amazing
[1:40:04] is people in the message, many of them
[1:40:07] spend the entirety of their life going
[1:40:10] through their Bible looking for more
[1:40:11] scriptures that brother Brandham
[1:40:12] fulfill. And they're trying to, you
[1:40:14] know, brother Brandham's this in
[1:40:15] Revelation, Brother Bam's this over here
[1:40:16] and Brother Bam is this over there and
[1:40:18] that over there. Why? They're so
[1:40:20] jealous. Amen. And some of the
[1:40:23] scriptures that they're attributing to
[1:40:24] the prophet of God is scriptures that's
[1:40:27] the Lord Jesus and no one else. That's
[1:40:30] right. Amen. Come on, children. Yes,
[1:40:33] sir. Oh my. So, John said, "My joy
[1:40:38] came. My joy has come." Do you You all
[1:40:41] think I'm sad? You think I'm sad? You,
[1:40:45] my followers, have come to try to tell
[1:40:46] me that this message you think is awful.
[1:40:49] It's a very sign my message was the
[1:40:51] truth. I have been able to hear the
[1:40:54] bridegroom's voice, and the bridegroom
[1:40:56] is speaking directly to the bride. Amen.
[1:40:59] Is there anybody here tonight that
[1:41:01] believe the bridegroom is doing it? Now,
[1:41:04] the bridegroom, what's he doing? He's
[1:41:05] using the ministry. He's using the Holy
[1:41:08] Spirit. And the spirit of God can speak
[1:41:10] through a tape, a book. Come on,
[1:41:12] somebody. The spirit of God can use a
[1:41:14] body. That's why it's so important for
[1:41:16] us to surrender everything we are, not
[1:41:19] just the preachers. God might want to
[1:41:22] use your sisters one day to speak a word
[1:41:24] of encouragement to somebody. the Holy
[1:41:27] Spirit, the Lord Jesus himself.
[1:41:32] Amen.
[1:41:35] Praise
[1:41:38] God. Thank you, Lord
[1:41:43] Jesus. What a foolish thing it would
[1:41:46] be for the best
[1:41:49] man to try to take the
[1:41:51] bride as his own.
[1:41:57] Friends, I honestly think some of these
[1:41:58] folks that follow the message of the
[1:42:00] hour, they fell in love with El Eastern
[1:42:02] on the way back to heaven more so than
[1:42:04] they did Isaac.
[1:42:06] They talk about him more. Oh yeah,
[1:42:09] they'll acknowledge the Lord Jesus, but
[1:42:10] it's always Brother Brandham, Brother
[1:42:11] Brandham, Brother Brandham, the prophet,
[1:42:13] the prophet, the prophet, the prophet.
[1:42:14] You ever get on some of their websites
[1:42:16] and count how many times they say
[1:42:17] brother Brandham and how many times they
[1:42:19] say the Lord Jesus? You get around some
[1:42:21] of them. I've been around some of them
[1:42:22] before and just counted. Sat there. They
[1:42:24] don't know what you're doing. Of course,
[1:42:25] sat there and count how many times they
[1:42:27] talk about brother Brandham and hardly
[1:42:28] nothing about the Lord Jesus. There's
[1:42:30] something wrong with your experience
[1:42:31] with God. Brother Brandham never wanted
[1:42:34] us to praise him. He never wanted us to
[1:42:36] worship him. No true man of God wants
[1:42:39] you to worship him. He wants you to
[1:42:41] worship the Lord Jesus. He wants you to
[1:42:43] give praise and adoration and honor to
[1:42:46] the Lord Jesus. There's no preacher
[1:42:48] among us that's worthy of such a thing.
[1:42:51] Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:42:54] Praise
[1:42:56] God. So, the friend,
[1:43:00] listen to this now. The friend, the
[1:43:03] bridegroom's voice, the friend at the
[1:43:06] time of the meeting of the bride and the
[1:43:09] groom would stand just outside the
[1:43:12] door as he would hear the
[1:43:15] bridegroom, as he would speak to the
[1:43:18] bride. Now remember, boys and girls
[1:43:20] didn't run off and get married in those
[1:43:22] days. And they didn't get rebellious and
[1:43:24] say, "Well, I'm getting tired of being
[1:43:26] at home. I'm going to get engaged and
[1:43:28] I'm I'm leaving home. Mama, daddy can't
[1:43:30] stop it. That ain't the way it worked."
[1:43:32] And when the prophet talks about them
[1:43:34] vows marrying you, that's the thing he's
[1:43:36] saying. You ministers go back and look
[1:43:38] in the Old Testament laws about it.
[1:43:41] It begins in the book of Genesis and
[1:43:43] runs right on down through the New
[1:43:44] Testament. Notice what John says in
[1:43:46] verse 30. The parent is now
[1:43:51] renouncing this position that they're
[1:43:54] trying to put him in. He must increase,
[1:43:59] but I
[1:44:01] must decrease.
[1:44:03] Amen. Why wouldn't any God called man
[1:44:08] want his church to be so in love with
[1:44:10] Jesus if you never mention my name? But
[1:44:14] you've got the love of God and you love
[1:44:17] him more than anything and you love one
[1:44:19] another and you husbands love your wives
[1:44:21] more and love your children more and you
[1:44:23] wives love your husbands more and so on.
[1:44:25] What man wouldn't want such a thing?
[1:44:28] What man would not get to that place to
[1:44:31] where he said, "Oh Lord, let them and so
[1:44:34] increase in your love. Let me decrease.
[1:44:37] Let me decrease. Get smaller and
[1:44:40] smaller. Let you get bigger and bigger.
[1:44:44] Hallelujah.
[1:44:47] Can I have a few more minutes? Let's
[1:44:50] look in 2 Corinthiansap
[1:44:52] 11:2. Paul in his
[1:44:55] age, for I am
[1:44:58] jealous over you with godly
[1:45:04] jealousy. For I have
[1:45:08] espoused
[1:45:10] you. Now, Peter never said this, nor did
[1:45:15] James. Nor did John, the great man of
[1:45:17] God that saw the visions on the aisle of
[1:45:19] Patmas.
[1:45:23] Only the
[1:45:24] paran of the Ephesians church age had
[1:45:28] this authority.
[1:45:31] I have aspoused you to one husband. Look
[1:45:35] at the meaning of the
[1:45:37] word haros.
[1:45:40] to
[1:45:41] join, to fit
[1:45:43] together, to betro a
[1:45:47] daughter to
[1:45:49] anyone, to give one in
[1:45:53] marriage to anyone. Anybody here tonight
[1:45:57] deny or doubt that Paul lacked the
[1:46:00] authority to do this?
[1:46:07] So, do you think living in that church
[1:46:09] age, it would have been
[1:46:11] important to hear Paul's teachings?
[1:46:15] Amen.
[1:46:18] Now, I realize some of the people in the
[1:46:19] message, some of the preachers have got
[1:46:21] to a place they said, well, you know,
[1:46:23] Brother Bram said, "Thus sayaith the
[1:46:24] Lord." You know, Brother Bam said, "Thus
[1:46:25] sayith the Lord on on church age, and
[1:46:27] brother Bam said, thus sayith the Lord
[1:46:29] on on church order and doctrine and
[1:46:31] stuff like that, I'll take it. But if he
[1:46:32] didn't say, "Thus sayith the Lord," I
[1:46:33] ain't going to tell. Well, let me just
[1:46:35] apply that same thing to you then about
[1:46:37] Paul. Let me go back and apply it about
[1:46:40] John. John said, "Behold the lamb of
[1:46:41] God." But there's one thing missing
[1:46:43] there. John never said, "Thus sayaith
[1:46:46] the Lord." That's true. As a matter of
[1:46:48] fact, show me any instances when John
[1:46:50] preached that he ever said, "Now this
[1:46:52] is, thus sayith the Lord. Thus sayith
[1:46:54] the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord." Can
[1:46:55] anybody show me where Paul whenever he
[1:46:58] stood? Now women should not preach. 1
[1:47:01] Corinthians 14:34 1 Timothy 2:12. I
[1:47:03] suffer not a woman to teach nor to
[1:47:05] assert authority over a man as also
[1:47:07] sayith the law. Paul never said that was
[1:47:08] thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:47:12] The Lord gave me this the other day and
[1:47:14] me and him had a spell. I tell you why.
[1:47:16] I said Lord that is so good. That is so
[1:47:19] good. Praise God. And people well
[1:47:22] brother say thus sayith the Lord. Well,
[1:47:23] you better start reading your Bible the
[1:47:25] same way, and you'll find out how few
[1:47:27] times thus sayaith the Lord is even used
[1:47:30] in the New Testament.
[1:47:34] Amen.
[1:47:36] Praise God. Thank you, Lord.
[1:47:39] Praise God. So John didn't say, "I,
[1:47:43] John, saw the holy city, the new
[1:47:44] Jerusalem descended from God out of
[1:47:46] heaven as a bride adorned for husband."
[1:47:48] John never said, "Thus sayaith the
[1:47:49] Lord." Sure did.
[1:47:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:57] Hallelujah. Boy, I'll get scorched over
[1:47:59] this. That's all right. I'd rather be
[1:48:00] scorched here than burn bad later.
[1:48:04] I'm trying my best to escape a real hide
[1:48:06] frying after a while. So, if I can get
[1:48:08] my hide fried here. Praise God. Yes,
[1:48:11] sir. Notice for I have espouse you.
[1:48:14] Notice it's not plural. We, me and Peter
[1:48:18] and James and John and Bartholomew and
[1:48:19] Matthew and Mark and all the rest of us.
[1:48:21] I
[1:48:24] I
[1:48:26] have espoused you to one
[1:48:34] husband that I
[1:48:36] may present
[1:48:39] you. Look at the
[1:48:41] espousal different stage than
[1:48:44] presentation.
[1:48:47] I have past tense espoused
[1:48:51] you that I may
[1:48:55] possibly
[1:48:57] possibly future
[1:49:00] tense present
[1:49:03] you friends. How many have sat around
[1:49:06] message
[1:49:07] churches and were espoused under the
[1:49:10] message of Malachi
[1:49:13] 4, actually responded to a bride call
[1:49:16] and separated themselves from their, you
[1:49:19] know, traditions, ideologies, and all
[1:49:22] that come
[1:49:23] apart. So, oh, I love this bride
[1:49:25] message. Praise God for a prophet. It's
[1:49:27] wonderful. It's awesome. And they
[1:49:29] actually entered in under an
[1:49:31] espousal of the message of the hour.
[1:49:35] But then they turn and walk away, never
[1:49:39] to be
[1:49:44] presented. What a shame.
[1:49:47] I have espoused you to one husband that
[1:49:50] I
[1:49:52] may. A spousal is not eternal security.
[1:49:57] I know this is the way we preached it,
[1:49:59] but that's error. That's not according
[1:50:01] to scripture. That's right.
[1:50:06] Betrosal, engagement, and
[1:50:09] presentation is not the same
[1:50:12] thing. That I may
[1:50:14] present
[1:50:16] you, present, stand
[1:50:20] by, to place beside or
[1:50:24] near, Lord
[1:50:26] Jesus, to present a person for another
[1:50:31] to see.
[1:50:33] and
[1:50:34] question to bring to bring
[1:50:38] near
[1:50:39] metaphorically to bring
[1:50:42] into one's
[1:50:45] fellowship or
[1:50:50] intimacy. This is why we believe with
[1:50:52] all of our hearts, if you're going to go
[1:50:55] in the rapture in the last days, you're
[1:50:58] going to have to follow the end time
[1:50:59] message. That's right. Amen.
[1:51:03] Oh, I know some of our message preachers
[1:51:05] I heard one said some time ago, there'll
[1:51:07] be Catholics going on the rapture.
[1:51:09] There'll be Baptists going on the
[1:51:10] rapture.
[1:51:14] Some of them preachers would be better
[1:51:15] off to just quit preaching. There
[1:51:18] wouldn't be near as much damnation on
[1:51:20] their souls.
[1:51:22] Why would God choose a
[1:51:25] friend? It shows how ignorant they are
[1:51:28] of scripture. They don't even know who a
[1:51:30] prophet is. They don't even know what
[1:51:32] John quoted there. And to realize what a
[1:51:34] position then who am I? Who am I? Who's
[1:51:37] some of these other preachers to think
[1:51:39] they know so much about God? Did God
[1:51:42] give me this
[1:51:43] honor? Did God give it to any of you?
[1:51:46] No, sir. Did God give it to any of our
[1:51:48] great message preachers that's on the
[1:51:50] earth now? He did not.
[1:51:54] Amen. So who do we think we are to argue
[1:51:57] with one that God himself gave him such
[1:52:01] a place of honor? That's true. and we
[1:52:05] dishonor
[1:52:08] him by our petty ideas and
[1:52:15] theology that I may present
[1:52:19] you as a chasteed
[1:52:22] virgin to Christ. I've acted as the
[1:52:28] parony, the bridegroom's friend in
[1:52:31] bringing
[1:52:32] you to the
[1:52:34] bridegroom. But what I want to do is
[1:52:37] take you to the final
[1:52:42] feast. You understand? Paul will be the
[1:52:46] one that will present the Ephesian age.
[1:52:48] I know there's people in the in this
[1:52:50] day, oh, we don't even need no William
[1:52:52] Brandom, no Elijah stuff. I'm going to
[1:52:54] stand there with Paul. It shows again
[1:52:56] how ignorant they are. That's right.
[1:52:57] Amen.
[1:52:59] God is the one who placed you in this
[1:53:01] age. And he placed a paran in this age
[1:53:03] and you will stand for or against that
[1:53:08] par. Amen. That's good. Amen.
[1:53:13] And that paranmous either stand for or
[1:53:16] against you. That's right.
[1:53:22] I don't want him standing against me.
[1:53:25] Now, I'm going to stand there with you.
[1:53:27] But remember, God has us divided in
[1:53:31] ranks. And Joel says they won't break
[1:53:34] the rank. In other words, they won't get
[1:53:36] out of their God called position. That's
[1:53:38] right, brother. Amen. It won't be me
[1:53:40] that'll stand there with the whole
[1:53:42] bride. It won't be brother Tim. It won't
[1:53:44] be Brother Ron. It won't be Brother
[1:53:46] Daryl.
[1:53:48] We will stand with the people God's give
[1:53:51] us influence in. I will not present the
[1:53:55] bride of this age. It's not my place.
[1:53:58] That's true. Who will? Elijah.
[1:54:04] The paramin of the Leodysian age. That's
[1:54:08] true.
[1:54:09] So one day in that resurrection when the
[1:54:11] body change and we gather together and
[1:54:13] this pastor and his group and this
[1:54:15] pastor and his group and we'll all get
[1:54:17] together. Amen. Come up missing on the
[1:54:19] earth and the devil can't find you no
[1:54:22] more. And then we're all going to gather
[1:54:24] under the oposes of the paran or the
[1:54:27] friend of the Lord Jesus of this age.
[1:54:30] Hallelujah. And when the saints of God,
[1:54:32] Paul will gather his, remember when the
[1:54:34] prophet was carried beyond the curtain
[1:54:36] of time, he never said anything about
[1:54:38] seeing Paul. He never said nothing about
[1:54:40] seeing Luther. He never said nothing
[1:54:42] about seeing Wesley. What did that voice
[1:54:45] tell him? These are your converts, the
[1:54:48] ones you led to Christ.
[1:54:51] Amen. And they said, they told him this.
[1:54:54] Argue with them if you want to, but they
[1:54:56] said, "If you had not have come down
[1:54:59] here, we could not have been here."
[1:55:04] I figure they know more about it than I
[1:55:06] do. I figure they know more about than
[1:55:08] any other preacher on the earth. Come
[1:55:10] on.
[1:55:14] Amen.
[1:55:18] But Paul saw that to us. It looks so
[1:55:21] different. Why? Because we don't relate
[1:55:23] to the marriage, right? We relate to it
[1:55:26] in the western
[1:55:31] way. But the engaged woman owes her
[1:55:35] love not to the
[1:55:38] parent but to the bridegroom.
[1:55:44] Her
[1:55:45] allegiance is to one.
[1:55:49] Let me stop here momentarily.
[1:55:53] Now look at verse
[1:55:55] three. If Paul believed what some people
[1:55:58] believe about betroal or
[1:56:01] engagement, how could he say these next
[1:56:04] words, but
[1:56:07] I
[1:56:11] fear? Now Paul has already told them, I
[1:56:14] have already engaged you to Christ.
[1:56:20] You're
[1:56:22] engaged, but I fear. Look at the word.
[1:56:27] It's
[1:56:29] unbelievable. Phobia, which is where we
[1:56:32] get phobia
[1:56:33] from. Be afraid. to put to flight by
[1:56:40] terrifying, to scare away, to be
[1:56:43] struck with
[1:56:45] fear, startled by strange
[1:56:49] sights or
[1:56:53] occurrences. So if betroal is eternal
[1:56:56] security, why in the world is Paul
[1:56:59] afraid?
[1:57:01] Paul could have said, "Rejoice. Praise
[1:57:03] God. You're sealed." That's it. that man
[1:57:05] ya y'all were already in.
[1:57:08] But Paul said, "I have engaged
[1:57:11] you. I have preached sanctification to
[1:57:14] you to set yourself apart from the
[1:57:17] world. But I've started being
[1:57:20] afraid. I'm
[1:57:22] fearing." Now, he ain't fearing for
[1:57:25] Christ. He ain't even fearing for his
[1:57:27] own
[1:57:28] position, but he's fearing for
[1:57:31] them. And then he tells them and us
[1:57:37] why
[1:57:38] lest by any
[1:57:40] means as the
[1:57:44] serpent Greek lexicon Strong's number
[1:57:50] 3789 Greek word
[1:57:52] ofus the serpent who deceived was
[1:57:55] regarded by the Jews
[1:57:58] as the devil.
[1:58:03] as a certain rebbitical
[1:58:07] teacher run into one of our message
[1:58:11] sisters in a medical situation some time
[1:58:15] ago in
[1:58:16] Ohio looked at her skirt and her hair
[1:58:18] and started inquiring you Pentecostal
[1:58:20] this that and the other no she said
[1:58:21] we're not Pentecostal said are you
[1:58:27] message she said yeah we we follow the
[1:58:30] message. She said, "How how'd you know?"
[1:58:33] He said, "We study William Brandham's
[1:58:36] message." A rabbitical school in New
[1:58:45] York. He told her a lot of things, but
[1:58:47] one thing I want to tell you that he did
[1:58:48] tell her, he said, "Y'all are right
[1:58:52] about the serpent seed."
[1:58:55] Well, we didn't need him to tell us
[1:58:56] that. Our parent already told us.
[1:59:00] [Laughter]
[1:59:03] But I
[1:59:04] fear friends. Do you understand the
[1:59:07] church at Corinth? Now what had
[1:59:09] happened? A false
[1:59:11] apostle had come into the church.
[1:59:16] Paul founded that
[1:59:17] church and now a false preacher had come
[1:59:21] in the church at Corinth trying to
[1:59:24] divide and separate and sew discord and
[1:59:26] false doctrine and this and
[1:59:29] that. And Paul said, "I'm afraid.
[1:59:33] I'm
[1:59:34] afraid lest by any means as the
[1:59:40] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:59:45] subility. So
[1:59:50] your
[1:59:52] ah your mind should be corrupted from
[1:59:56] the
[1:59:57] simplicity that is
[1:59:59] in Christ.
[2:00:02] Don't you understand what was happening
[2:00:04] in Corinth? Eden was
[2:00:08] reoccurring
[2:00:12] again. Do you understand?
[2:00:14] Eden has reoccurred
[2:00:17] millions of times
[2:00:20] over in churches, in families, in
[2:00:27] individuals when Satan would start
[2:00:30] working on people's
[2:00:32] minds and corrupt the simplicity of the
[2:00:36] gospel and talk them out of their
[2:00:39] position. Why in the world would he go
[2:00:42] back to Eve in the Garden of
[2:00:46] Eden? Same
[2:00:49] scenario. An engaged woman. Now
[2:00:52] remember, Adam had not yet known her.
[2:00:56] She was not yet his wife.
[2:01:00] The word translated here for simplicity
[2:01:03] simply means
[2:01:05] sincerity or singleness of
[2:01:10] devotion. So a divided heart leads to a
[2:01:14] defiled
[2:01:15] life. But
[2:01:17] singleness of
[2:01:21] devotion. Oh my. For if he that cometh
[2:01:25] preacheth another
[2:01:27] Jesus whom we have not preached. Now
[2:01:32] actually Paul is saying this out of
[2:01:34] sarcasm. Now he's saying, "Okay, so
[2:01:36] there's somebody else here and they're
[2:01:38] coming preaching another Jesus and
[2:01:40] they're preaching an easier Jesus than I
[2:01:42] preached." Oh, there's a lot of them
[2:01:44] preaching that Jesus today, ain't
[2:01:46] it? Or if you've received another
[2:01:49] spirit. So if there is another Jesus and
[2:01:51] that that other Jesus must have produced
[2:01:53] another Holy Ghost. So if he's preached
[2:01:56] another Jesus and you've received
[2:01:58] another Holy Ghost, then he said another
[2:02:00] gospel, which makes sense that it would
[2:02:02] be that way, which ye have not accepted,
[2:02:05] you might well bear with him. So if he's
[2:02:07] got another Jesus and he's got another
[2:02:09] gospel and you've got another Holy
[2:02:11] Ghost, then go ahead and accept him. Oh
[2:02:13] my.
[2:02:17] Wow.
[2:02:21] Let me close with
[2:02:23] this question
[2:02:25] answers
[2:02:28] 1964. You are my
[2:02:31] children that I have begotten to Christ.
[2:02:34] Amen. I claim every one of you. I claim
[2:02:38] you
[2:02:39] tonight. I claim you all time. I always
[2:02:43] claim you as my brother and sister.
[2:02:46] You're my
[2:02:48] children. I'm your father in the gospel.
[2:02:52] Not fathers. It would be a priest, but
[2:02:54] I'm your father in the
[2:02:58] gospel.
[2:03:00] Oh, so you mean we have had another
[2:03:10] paran? I have begotten you to Christ and
[2:03:13] I espouse you to Christ. that
[2:03:16] is that's engaged you to Christ as a
[2:03:20] chase
[2:03:21] virgin.
[2:03:23] Don't let me
[2:03:26] down. Don't let me
[2:03:30] down. You stay a chase virgin. How will
[2:03:33] I do it, brother Brandham?
[2:03:39] Y'all ready? It's deep. Oh, it's so
[2:03:42] deep. It's so
[2:03:45] mysterious. It's so
[2:03:47] deep. There won't be but just a handful
[2:03:50] that'll be able to obey these next few
[2:03:56] sentences. Stay right with the
[2:03:59] word. Live
[2:04:02] clean and
[2:04:04] pure. Have nothing to
[2:04:07] do with the
[2:04:09] things of the world.
[2:04:17] My
[2:04:18] friends, this is the
[2:04:22] crescendo of the message of Malachi
[2:04:26] 4. Will there be a thousand, 10,000,
[2:04:30] half a million, 5 million, 40 million?
[2:04:33] That's up to God.
[2:04:36] But one day in the
[2:04:39] resurrection, our prophet will be raised
[2:04:41] from the dead and all the rest are
[2:04:44] raised with him. Not in a private
[2:04:45] resurrection because there is no such
[2:04:46] teaching in the
[2:04:49] scripture. And we will all gathered
[2:04:51] together on the
[2:04:52] earth and then we'll be caught up into
[2:04:55] his
[2:04:56] presence. Age by age they'll be
[2:04:59] presented.
[2:05:01] Peter, even though he's been gone for
[2:05:03] thousands of years, he still hasn't seen
[2:05:05] Jesus yet. Paul hasn't seen him.
[2:05:08] Luther's age hasn't seen
[2:05:11] him. One by one, the paranymph of the
[2:05:15] church age will stand there and present
[2:05:18] the bride of the Ephesian
[2:05:21] age. Here will walk the bride of the
[2:05:23] Ephesian age and behind Paul.
[2:05:28] Come, oh ye blessed of my father, enter
[2:05:31] into the joys of the Lord, which was
[2:05:33] prepared for you before the foundation
[2:05:35] of the world. Here will come the second
[2:05:37] age, the third age, on down, on down to
[2:05:42] the
[2:05:43] seventh. I don't care for the last
[2:05:46] group. Do you? I don't care for the last
[2:05:49] four, 500, or 600 or whatever it is is
[2:05:52] going to be back out there. And we're
[2:05:53] the very last ones right at the very end
[2:05:56] of the line. They say, "Donnie, is that
[2:05:58] you?" Say, "Yeah, Lord, I'm here. I'm
[2:05:59] getting my time. I'll be up there in a
[2:06:00] few
[2:06:01] minutes." And here we all come and we'll
[2:06:05] walk right up with our church age
[2:06:08] messenger. And the paran of the age will
[2:06:12] stand right there by the
[2:06:15] door. Glory to God. He'll stand right
[2:06:19] there by the door. the Lord
[2:06:23] Jesus and say, "My
[2:06:26] Lord, this is your bride."
[2:06:33] Can't Can't you understand
[2:06:36] why he nearly
[2:06:38] fainted in the vision when he saw the
[2:06:43] bride and then he saw the church and the
[2:06:47] church was nearly
[2:06:48] naked holding gray paper in front of him
[2:06:51] in front and behind was totally naked
[2:06:54] and he said, "Oh God, oh God, is that
[2:06:57] the best I could
[2:07:01] do. I could
[2:07:06] do. And then a voice said, "The bride
[2:07:11] must come back
[2:07:12] again." When the prophet says it that
[2:07:14] way, then he says, "Because she is
[2:07:17] alpha and omega."
[2:07:21] So he saw the church dancing to rock and
[2:07:24] roll led by witch, short hair, makeup.
[2:07:30] And then here come the bride again
[2:07:32] marching onward Christian
[2:07:38] solders. And then the very last
[2:07:41] ones right before the bride's
[2:07:44] consummation, they started looking at
[2:07:46] that
[2:07:47] church and they stepped out of line. So
[2:07:50] everybody's just
[2:07:52] h and they
[2:07:54] got and they got out of step and they
[2:07:57] got they got to look. They got their
[2:07:59] eyes off the paran. They got their eyes
[2:08:00] off the word. They got the eyes off the
[2:08:02] husband and they started watching that
[2:08:03] church cuz that church was going down
[2:08:09] screaming and they started looking at
[2:08:11] that church and they got all beside
[2:08:15] themselves. But the parent said, "Get
[2:08:18] back in line.
[2:08:22] Get back in
[2:08:26] line." What did they do?
[2:08:31] One word
[2:08:37] Christian.
[2:08:45] Hallelujah. Lord
[2:08:54] Jesus. Oh my
[2:08:57] God. Help
[2:09:01] me. Help these
[2:09:04] people. Help your bride around the
[2:09:09] world. Lord, there's so many things that
[2:09:12] try to pull our
[2:09:13] attention away from the
[2:09:17] word. And all of them aren't sinful.
[2:09:21] Sometimes it's just
[2:09:23] life,
[2:09:25] job things. We have to go here and go
[2:09:28] there and do this and do that and we
[2:09:30] could just get so busy, so caught up
[2:09:33] with
[2:09:35] life. Help us, Jesus.
[2:09:42] Lord God,
[2:09:43] I you know my prayer before you is
[2:09:47] constantly give me wisdom to lead your
[2:09:52] people. How can
[2:09:55] I lead them to a place that I myself
[2:10:00] have never
[2:10:01] been? Or if they want to go to my house,
[2:10:03] I could take them. If they want to go to
[2:10:05] the mall, I could take them. If they
[2:10:06] want to go to Lowe's, if they want to go
[2:10:07] to where I used to live in Kentucky, I
[2:10:09] could take them. If they want to go
[2:10:10] different places, I've been around the
[2:10:11] world, I could take them cuz I've been
[2:10:14] there, but I've never been to your city
[2:10:19] myself. I've never been to heaven as
[2:10:21] immortals.
[2:10:26] But you took your paran of this
[2:10:29] day into that
[2:10:32] dimension and sent him back down here to
[2:10:36] tell us what it was
[2:10:39] like. So it gives me
[2:10:42] confidence in what he taught us.
[2:10:45] Lord, you gave him such an
[2:10:48] honor to carry him up to such a place.
[2:10:51] No doubt it was for his benefit, but I
[2:10:54] cannot keep from believing it was for
[2:10:56] ours as
[2:10:58] well. You honored
[2:11:01] him by letting him see such
[2:11:04] things and hear such
[2:11:08] things. And Lord Jesus, may I be a
[2:11:12] faithful
[2:11:14] minister. Lord God, may I preach? Say
[2:11:17] what he said because I believe he said
[2:11:20] what Paul
[2:11:21] said. As a matter of fact, them
[2:11:24] theophanes, them
[2:11:27] souls said, "We are resting on
[2:11:31] that." Well, how in the world can we
[2:11:34] debate it here and rest on it there?
[2:11:36] Makes no sense. We rest on it there and
[2:11:39] argue it here.
[2:11:43] I believe I was part of that great crowd
[2:11:46] there. So if that was my testimony
[2:11:49] there, it's my testimony here. I'm
[2:11:52] resting on it. There's things I say and
[2:11:56] preach that he said, I don't even
[2:11:57] understand it, but I'm going to say it
[2:11:59] and preach it anyway. There's things
[2:12:02] Paul said I don't understand, but I'm
[2:12:03] going to say what he said, and you'll
[2:12:05] hold him accountable, not
[2:12:08] me. Help me, Jesus.
[2:12:11] Help
[2:12:13] me. I don't want to lead them
[2:12:15] wrong. I don't want to influence them
[2:12:19] wrong. Oh Jesus, help me to stay under
[2:12:22] the
[2:12:24] anointing of the angel of God in the
[2:12:27] last
[2:12:28] days. That angel I'm speaking of is the
[2:12:30] prophet saying, "Brother, if you think I
[2:12:32] was speaking of myself a while ago,
[2:12:33] you're wrong. But I'm speaking of the
[2:12:36] angel of the Lord in the camp."
[2:12:39] Well, the prophet of God is not here,
[2:12:41] but the angels of God are still here
[2:12:44] among
[2:12:46] us. Oh Jesus, lead us. Guide
[2:12:50] us. Send those heavenly visitors. My
[2:12:54] father, Lord, there's times we don't
[2:12:56] know which way to go, things we don't
[2:12:58] know what to do or say. We need you, my
[2:13:01] God. Help every god call man around the
[2:13:05] world, Lord, to stay true to stay
[2:13:09] humble. Satan will tempt him with
[2:13:12] arrogance to rise above the revealed
[2:13:15] word because they feel like this this
[2:13:18] needs to be said. The prophet didn't say
[2:13:20] it quite that way, but oh, it needs to
[2:13:21] be said. It's got to be said, and
[2:13:23] they'll be tempted to step beyond it one
[2:13:25] time, and once they do it once, the next
[2:13:28] time it'll be
[2:13:30] easier. Then they may say, "Well, I
[2:13:32] don't exactly agree with what he said
[2:13:34] here." And they'll they'll break over
[2:13:35] one time, and then it'll be that, and
[2:13:38] then it'll be Romans 7, and then it'll
[2:13:40] be who we should marry, and what type of
[2:13:42] marriage we should have, and then the
[2:13:44] next thing it'll be over this, and over
[2:13:45] that, and before long, they've got a
[2:13:47] whole string of
[2:13:49] things. Jesus, help
[2:13:52] me. Keep me,
[2:13:54] Jesus. Keep me true, Lord.
[2:13:59] I've done come too far now, Lord. I I
[2:14:01] I'll never be the
[2:14:04] same. Jesus, I thank you for this
[2:14:07] word. I have no desire to go back to
[2:14:11] what I came out
[2:14:13] of. I burnt those bridges, those
[2:14:16] ships, all them ways back. There ain't
[2:14:19] no way
[2:14:22] back. Amen. We're going home, Lord.
[2:14:27] and we're going
[2:14:29] soon. Praise
[2:14:31] God. And we know that it was the friend
[2:14:35] of the
[2:14:36] bridegroom that actually sent the
[2:14:39] bride's
[2:14:40] dress that the groom had bought for
[2:14:44] her. The paranymph would either deliver
[2:14:47] it himself or send a
[2:14:49] servant the day of the great union. But
[2:14:53] the bride didn't know the moment or the
[2:14:56] hour. But the servant would tell her,
[2:14:58] "Get
[2:15:01] ready." The bridegroom was still at the
[2:15:04] father's
[2:15:05] house, and he would choose the hour.
[2:15:08] Then he would tell his
[2:15:11] friend, "It's time to
[2:15:14] go."
[2:15:16] Hallelujah. And the bride was ready,
[2:15:19] dressed, and waiting.
[2:15:23] And the bride would hear it from a
[2:15:26] distance. The music, the singing, the
[2:15:31] dancing. That's the way she
[2:15:35] knew the hour had
[2:15:38] arrived. She didn't get a 24-hour
[2:15:40] notice. They didn't text her and say, "3
[2:15:42] hours, we'll be there." She was just to
[2:15:44] get ready and sit there and
[2:15:46] wait. Praise God.
[2:15:50] Oh, I can imagine as it got close
[2:15:52] enough, the music was playing, the
[2:15:56] symbols were slashing together, the
[2:16:00] harps, praise be to God, the dancers was
[2:16:05] dancing and
[2:16:06] shouting. Here came the bridegroom and
[2:16:09] the friend of the bridegroom was walking
[2:16:11] just behind him over to one side not to
[2:16:16] get into that position of the greatest
[2:16:18] of
[2:16:19] all. And the bride would hear it with
[2:16:22] anticipation. She couldn't go raise the
[2:16:24] window. She couldn't open the door. She
[2:16:27] just had to sit there and wait. But she
[2:16:30] could tell from the sound of the music,
[2:16:33] it's getting closer and closer.
[2:16:37] Imagine that little bride had heart was
[2:16:40] erasing. It was climbing up in her
[2:16:43] throat and there she was standing with
[2:16:45] under such
[2:16:47] anticipation waiting for
[2:16:53] what? Glory to God.
[2:16:57] Then the bride would go open the
[2:16:59] door and there stood her
[2:17:04] bridegroom. Right by his
[2:17:06] side was his dear
[2:17:09] friend. The friend would reach, grab a
[2:17:13] hold to the bride's hand, put her hand
[2:17:17] in the hand of the bridegroom.
[2:17:20] He would take her across the threshold
[2:17:23] and say, "Come away, my
[2:17:27] love. Let us go to our
[2:17:31] house."
[2:17:33] Hallelujah.
[2:17:35] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus, may we lay aside
[2:17:38] anything and everything that hinders us,
[2:17:41] Lord.
[2:17:44] the shout, the voice, the trumpet. And
[2:17:49] he does all three of these things as
[2:17:52] he's he's
[2:17:54] he's
[2:17:57] descending. A
[2:17:59] shout, a
[2:18:01] voice, a
[2:18:03] trumpet, a shout to get the people
[2:18:07] ready, and the
[2:18:09] voice of him who will raise the
[2:18:12] dead and the trumpet to call them all
[2:18:17] together. Praise
[2:18:19] God. We worship you tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:18:24] We're not here to praise the name of the
[2:18:28] paran. We're not here to adore the
[2:18:32] pastor. We're not here to uplift the
[2:18:35] evangelist that's on the
[2:18:37] field. But we're here tonight to praise
[2:18:40] the
[2:18:41] name of our heavenly broadcast
[2:18:45] who redeemed us
[2:18:48] when we were lost
[2:18:50] who saved us so much that we will never
[2:18:55] be lost again.
[2:18:57] You found us so well we will never ever
[2:19:02] be lost again.
[2:19:04] But we are yours
[2:19:07] forever.
[2:19:10] Oh
[2:19:12] Jesus. Lord, may our ears be so in tune
[2:19:17] tonight that we can hear the heavenly
[2:19:20] band as they're tuning up their
[2:19:23] instruments.
[2:19:24] Praise
[2:19:26] God. When the angels will be
[2:19:28] singing, there will be a wedding day.
[2:19:34] Not so very far
[2:19:38] away. Jesus is coming for his
[2:19:43] bride to be ever at his
[2:19:48] side. Hallelujah.
[2:19:53] One of the signs that we'll
[2:19:55] know is when we look and see there will
[2:19:59] be brother Alan
[2:20:01] McKenna, brother Homer
[2:20:04] Arnold, there'll be sister Clark saying,
[2:20:07] "Help us
[2:20:09] Jesus."
[2:20:12] Hallelujah.
[2:20:15] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. and we'll
[2:20:18] look and see our loved ones and we'll
[2:20:21] know it won't be
[2:20:22] long. We're going to be
[2:20:25] changed. Lord God, I bless you tonight,
[2:20:29] Father. I worship you, Lord
[2:20:33] Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:20:38] Can we stand our
[2:20:40] feet not in the presence of our
[2:20:43] paran, not in the presence of our pastor
[2:20:47] or teacher or
[2:20:49] evangelist, but in the presence of our
[2:20:51] Greek
[2:20:53] king, the one who is here who has joined
[2:20:58] his bride to himself. You see, he done
[2:21:01] something just a little bit unusual and
[2:21:03] different in this day.
[2:21:05] He slipped down and he took his
[2:21:07] Juliet and took her to
[2:21:11] himself and he already pregnantated
[2:21:14] her and she's already joined together in
[2:21:18] an invisible
[2:21:19] union. And when the devil come to try to
[2:21:22] pull her away, he found her womb was
[2:21:26] already
[2:21:27] sealed. Glory to God.
[2:21:31] Glory to God. It's
[2:21:34] impenetrable. No matter how hard he
[2:21:36] tries, he tries faults, mistakes,
[2:21:40] failures, YouTube videos, this ex person
[2:21:43] that followed the message, this one,
[2:21:45] that one, the other one, and nothing can
[2:21:48] penetrate the seal cuz her womb has
[2:21:51] already been sealed and she's
[2:21:53] pregnantated with Christ own seed
[2:21:58] himself. So, we're not going to the
[2:22:00] wedding.
[2:22:02] We're going to the marriage supper of
[2:22:06] the lamb.
[2:22:09] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:22:12] Praise the Lord
[2:22:13] [Music]
[2:22:15] Jesus. What about an espoused
[2:22:18] bride? I'm asking you the
[2:22:21] question, are you going to be
[2:22:24] presented as a chase virgin? You imagine
[2:22:27] a man that's engaged to a woman and
[2:22:31] before the wedding night he finds out
[2:22:33] she's with
[2:22:34] child of another brother in the
[2:22:38] church or a deacon or a
[2:22:43] preacher. Do you understand that's
[2:22:44] what's happening in the ranks of the
[2:22:47] message? Some of these people that been
[2:22:49] engaged to Christ and they are
[2:22:51] pregnant with the seed of some kingdom
[2:22:58] builder. So they're more concerned about
[2:23:00] pleasing that man, that kingdom builder,
[2:23:03] than they are the Lord Jesus.
[2:23:08] If there's one person in this
[2:23:10] congregation gets spiritually
[2:23:12] pregnantated with the seed of your
[2:23:15] pastor, then I have failed you.
[2:23:22] My job in that sense is a
[2:23:28] unic. a
[2:23:31] unic that I cannot pass my
[2:23:36] seed to pregnant
[2:23:40] you. But simply to repeat the seed word
[2:23:43] of life as it passes through my lips
[2:23:48] that you don't want to be a little
[2:23:49] Donnie Reagan, a little Daryl Ward, a
[2:23:51] little brother John, a little brother
[2:23:53] Joel, but you want to be the image of
[2:23:57] Christ Jesus.
[2:24:01] Hallelujah.
[2:24:07] Sing whatever's on your
[2:24:10] heart. What about it, little engaged
[2:24:14] bride? Whose
[2:24:16] wife will you
[2:24:19] be? Whose wife are
[2:24:25] you? So Rebecca's going to leave on this
[2:24:27] journey. We'll get her there
[2:24:30] eventually. There's men along the way, a
[2:24:33] servant along the way, men along the way
[2:24:35] that could pass their seat and defile
[2:24:38] her. But when she gets to
[2:24:41] Isaac and he runs out in the field and
[2:24:44] she
[2:24:46] says to the
[2:24:48] parent, "Who is this that meets us in
[2:24:52] the field?" And he says, "It is my
[2:25:01] master." The Bible says she liided off
[2:25:05] of the camel. We're not talking about a
[2:25:08] Shetland pony. We're talking about a
[2:25:10] camel that would range from 7 to 8 ft
[2:25:13] tall in between the
[2:25:16] humps. She didn't wait for steps or an
[2:25:19] elevator, but she lied off the back of
[2:25:22] the camel.
[2:25:24] Hallelujah.
[2:25:29] And the Bible
[2:25:31] says he took
[2:25:33] her into his mother's
[2:25:36] tent and she
[2:25:39] became his
[2:25:43] wife. Where's the six weeks of
[2:25:45] introduction? Where's the months of
[2:25:48] interrogation? Who you been with? What
[2:25:50] have you been doing?
[2:25:53] This servant was so trustworthy. She
[2:25:56] could go straight from his
[2:25:58] hands into the arms of her husband and
[2:26:03] love
[2:26:04] her. He did not have to interrogate him
[2:26:07] and make him vow, did you touch her? Did
[2:26:10] you do anything to
[2:26:12] her? That's the kind of pastor I want to
[2:26:15] be to my Lord
[2:26:17] Jesus so he'll not have to interrogate
[2:26:20] me on that day. All right, Donnie, give
[2:26:21] an account. What'd you do? Did you
[2:26:24] defile her? Did you try to sew your own
[2:26:26] seed? He can know me so well. He can
[2:26:30] know the rest of our preachers here so
[2:26:32] well. He just say, "Thank you, guys.
[2:26:34] You're dismissed. I'll take her to my
[2:26:36] side." Amen. Yes, sir. Oh,
[2:26:41] glory. Thank you, Lord.
[2:26:43] Hallelujah.
[2:26:45] Remember it was typed on the Song of
[2:26:48] Solomon that he sent his own buyer B I E
[2:26:54] R which was Solomon's own
[2:26:58] couch which was made of cedar
[2:27:02] blue purple gold
[2:27:07] silver cedar
[2:27:09] overlaid deity overlaid the humanity
[2:27:12] gold speaking of deity Silver speaking
[2:27:15] of redemption. Blue speaking of the
[2:27:17] heavenly. Purple speaking of the
[2:27:19] priestly
[2:27:22] order. And little Miss Shulamite
[2:27:25] climbing up in Solomon's own
[2:27:28] couch and kind of
[2:27:32] reclining. And them guards. The Bible
[2:27:34] said every one of them, they were
[2:27:38] Solomon's personal
[2:27:41] bodyguard. and every one of them drew a
[2:27:46] sword. It would have been weeks of
[2:27:49] travel
[2:27:50] back. They would have had to take watch
[2:27:53] during the
[2:27:54] night. You imagine how inquisitive she
[2:27:58] was. So tell me, what do I do? I've
[2:28:01] never been a queen
[2:28:02] before. How am I to act?
[2:28:06] Oh, my
[2:28:07] lady. My lady. When we get near the
[2:28:10] city, they will be there to meet you.
[2:28:14] Me? They're going to come to meet me.
[2:28:16] Yes, my
[2:28:18] lady. They will come with
[2:28:21] incense, with timberals, with harps,
[2:28:25] with
[2:28:26] dancing. You imagine they got closer and
[2:28:30] closer. And the night before they told
[2:28:32] her, "My
[2:28:33] lady, tomorrow will
[2:28:36] arrive. Are you ready
[2:28:39] for but I don't know am I am I
[2:28:43] ready? What will I please him?" He will
[2:28:47] love you so
[2:28:50] much. And the next day the city was all
[2:28:57] elated and Solomon sent him out. It was
[2:29:01] against protocol for him to go get her.
[2:29:04] So they had to meet between his home and
[2:29:07] hers. So the musicians, the incense
[2:29:11] burners, they all come and here she
[2:29:13] comes
[2:29:15] laying back on the king's own couch.
[2:29:20] The music, the
[2:29:23] symbols. Here comes King
[2:29:26] Solomon, my lady. Here he
[2:29:29] comes. Here he comes. Susan, what should
[2:29:32] I do? What should I
[2:29:34] do? What should I
[2:29:36] do? Don't worry, my
[2:29:39] lady. He loves you so
[2:29:43] much. We have never seen
[2:29:46] him so excited.
[2:29:50] just be
[2:29:54] yourself. It was that that caught his
[2:29:58] attention before the
[2:30:02] foundation of the
[2:30:05] world. Let me close. I'm just now in
[2:30:08] preaching gear. I could go half the
[2:30:10] night
[2:30:14] saying, "Come
[2:30:16] [Music]
[2:30:20] away, my
[2:30:22] [Music]
[2:30:24] love." Oh, come away.

[2:32:15] linen. A banquet is prepared.
[2:32:20] A host of angels
[2:32:23] gather for the
[2:32:26] celebration
[2:32:29] there. The bride is almost
[2:32:32] ready in spotless
[2:32:36] wine. A hush falls over
[2:32:41] heaven as her groom begins to
[2:32:46] say, "Come
[2:32:52] away. Thank you,
[2:32:55] Jesus. Come
[2:33:02] away. Thank you, Jesus. Lord God, we

[2:33:34] I've carried that love with me all the
[2:33:38] way to
[2:33:42] Calvary. Though it wasn't
[2:33:45] over, when they laid me in the
[2:33:50] tomb, I proved my love would never die.
[2:33:55] I rose again for you.
[2:34:01] Come
