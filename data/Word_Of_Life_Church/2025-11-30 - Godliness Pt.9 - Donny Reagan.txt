Look at your neighbor and tell them you're glad to see him in church today. Praise the Lord. What a privilege it is to be here. And some of you ain't glad to see him yet.

Do you love the Lord with all your heart? Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Trust all of you had a wonderful Thanksgiving. So glad to be back in the house of the Lord looking to what God would have for us today. We're going to look at our prayer request. If you don't mind, you just stand with me for just a few minutes. Please continue to pray for Brother Curtis Hunnel as he recovers from a hip and leg injury due to a fall several days ago. The X-rays did not show any broken bones. He is now scheduled for an MRI on Friday, December the 5th. Please pray he will re receive a good report for a speedy recovery so that he can return to church and back to normal activities. So we just commit that unto the Lord. Brother Samuel Shuffler turns this in this morning that he's going to be looking for a new place to live due to some things that's happened there uh where he's at now. Uh he could stayed all the time that he was permitted to stay there. Uh he just trusted the Lord for a miracle. So, let's help brother Samuel pray that God will provide a place. How many of you know God's got a place? We just commit that unto the Lord. Love brother Samuel Schuffer this morning. Amen. Want to remember Brenda Kite in prayer. That's a friend of ours suffering from breast cancer. She asked us that we would remember her in prayer. So, let's remember her today. Also, Sister Shirley Lunford fell, broke her arm up into her shoulder. She's in quite a bit of pain. So, we want to remember her that the Lord would just uh just be with her and give her a a real speedy recovery. We know he's more than able to do that, don't we? Amen.

Uh visiting hours from 12 until 1 and the service at 1, the committal uh after that. So, uh, if you could be here to just show your support, and we certainly want to pray that the Lord would just remember the Hayden family and and be with him and just love him real good and and hold him in his arms. We know he's more than able to be a friend that that's closer than a brother. Is that right? Brother Bean wants us to remember Sister Lou being in prayer fighting bronchitis, a kidney infection. Let's remember her, brother Bird and Sister Barbara uh asking for prayer this morning that the Lord would just be with them. We know that God cares about those folks. Sister Ruth Louise Jack's called to request a special unspoken prayer request for both of her daughters. God knows all about their situation. So, let's remember them in prayer today. Brother Jim Hughes offered this testimony and prayer request. He wants to thank uh uh all of you for for your praying. uh his wife Ladonna during her knee replacement surgery and recovery. Everything went well. She's doing much better. Also, Brother Jim is asking for prayer for two close friends. Their names are John Balden and Samuel Bricky. Both are fighting cancer and are asking God to move on their behalf. Please keep Brother Jim in continued prayer. He's still dealing with severe pain in his hands from arthritis. They love and appreciate everyone very much. Would like nothing better than to be in this service with us. So, we certainly want to pray for those folks. That's some good people right there. Also want to remember little Kanan Woods. Hello. I'm requesting prayer for my greatgrandson Kanan Woods that God would put angels around him.

So we want to remember that prayer request this morning that the Lord would be mindful of that situation. all the unspoken prayer request. We know God's got it all in control, don't we?

And Brother Brandham said there has to be a crucifixion before there's a resurrection. And he's he's working on all of us. He's getting us ready ready for the resurrection. He has to have us in a place that we can go in a rapture or no not go. Let's [clears throat] just go to the Lord in prayer. Dear Lord Jesus, what a [snorts] wonderful savior you are. I every time I get up here, I think of brother Struberry. how he had a way just to praise you in such a loving way. I wish I could do that, Lord. May you be with each each request. There's so many sick and afflicted among us. And God, [snorts] but we we rely on you. We like we said, we have to go through things to get ready to leave here. And we know it's closer closer and closer every day as we see the world events, see people going through these things. And but there's also faith being raised up in people, Lord. The God that we love won't forget us. He'll be with us, Lord Jesus. And God, be with these requests. Every everyone is very important to you. And Lord, help us to take him on our hearts when we leave here. Just help us to leave here and pray pray for him during the week and things. Be with our pastor this morning.

I love that song. That's one of my top five favorite songs. If you help me sing the chorus of this song, I think everybody might know it. How I [singing] long to breathe the air of heaven where pain is [singing and music] gone and mercy fills the streets. [music] To look upon [singing] the one [music] who bled to save me and walk with him for [music and singing] all eternity. eternity. For there will [singing and music] be a day when all will bow before him. There [singing] will [music] be a day when death will be no more. standing face [singing and music] to face with he who died and rose [music and singing] again. Holy, holy is the Lord. And every [music] prayer [singing] we prayed in desperation the songs of [music and singing] faith we sang through doubt and fear. In the [singing] end we'll see that [music] it was worth it when he [music] returns to wipe [singing] away our tears. years. Oh, and [singing] there will be [music] a day when all will [singing] bow before him. And there will [music] be a day [singing] when death will be no more standing [singing and music] face to face. But he who died and rose again. [singing and music] Holy, holy is [singing and music] the Lord. And on that day we join the resurrection and stand beside [singing] the heroes of the faith. [music] And with [singing] one voice a thousand generations [music] singing [singing] worthy is the lamb who was slain. And on [music and singing] that day we join the resurrection and stand [music] beside [singing] the great heroes of the faith. [music] And with one [singing] voice a thousand [music] generations singing [singing] worthy [music] is the lamb who was slain [music] forever. He shall [singing] reign. So let it be. [music] Today we shout the hymn [singing] of heaven with angels and [music] the saints. We raise [singing] a mighty roar and glory to [music] our God who gave [singing] us life beyond the [music] grave. Holy, holy is the Lord. Oh, let [music and singing] it be today. We shout the hymn of heaven with angels and the saints. We [music and singing] raise a mighty ro. Glory to our [music] God who gave us life beyond. Holy, [music] holy is the Lord. Holy, holy [music] is the Lord. [singing] Holy, [music] holy is the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; one who's made it possible, isn't he? It makes me sad in my heart [clears throat] whenever we think about stand together the season that we're coming into and people celebrate supposedly him coming to the earth and what he did and most of it turns into commercialization turns into Santa Claus and lights and icicles and all that sort of It makes you wonder how many people who even [clears throat] claim to be Christians understand one tenth of 1% of what he gave up to come to this earth for us. I hope we never forget that as Christians. We're not here today to see each other. Though we are here to speak to one another and have fellowship with one another. We're not here to be catered to. We're not here to find fault. We're not here to be able to pick over one another's clothes and who dress the nicest. And we're actually here to hear our faults, our shortcomings. &gt;&gt; How that we can be made more like him. Is that your desire? &gt;&gt; I want to serve him better. how much ever life I have left. &gt;&gt; I don't know about how long that'll be. An hour, a day, a month, a year, 25 years. Who knows exactly what it'll be, but I want to live every day of my life as if though my life would come to an end that day and I'll never have the opportunity to fix anything with anybody. &gt;&gt; I want to live fixed. Praise the Lord. How many wants to live fixed? &gt;&gt; That you don't have to call somebody. Hey, I talked about you. Hey, I run you down. Hey, I spread a lie on you. I'm so sorry. One of these days when life leaves this body, we'll have no opportunity to do that. There's nothing like living a clean life. Nothing. I'm just so grateful the Lord has made a way that we can be clean. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad we could come to church today? &gt;&gt; It seems like it's been two weeks since we've been to church. &gt;&gt; Man, a lot of we just missed one Wednesday night, but I know I'm weird and I look at it strange, but to me, church has such value. Amen. &gt;&gt; I honor I honor and still consider it sacred. &gt;&gt; Brother John was able to build this for me. I saw a picture online and uh through trying to design it and figure out how big to make it and all this that and the other. The walnut came from a place not too far away. had the columns made and brother Dao and brother Den painted it for us, finished it and all that. And it wasn't the walnut that was any more special than other walnut. As a matter of fact, I got a whole bunch of it right down there in storage and a brother brought me some just this week. So, it wasn't that walnut that was sacred. There was no sacred tree out in the forest that they went and got. But what's made this place sacred is his presence. This carpet could have wound up on a bar floor. The sheetrock could have wound up in a honky tonk. These lights could have wound up in all kinds of places. But what makes it sacred to us, his presence, and he loves together with his children. &gt;&gt; I hope you love that, too. &gt;&gt; Let's turn if you would. Today, we greet [clears throat] you all in the name of the Lord Jesus. What a great honor and privilege it is. I've been standing behind sacred desk for a long, long time, 51 years, I guess. And I hope and pray to God that it never becomes just a place where I preach my job something I'm supposed to do. When that happens to a preacher, he's in a mess. &gt;&gt; You see, when many of you get in trouble, you can go to your pastor or you can go to evangelist or somebody and you can empty out and just I'm I'm dealing with this. I'm dealing with that. But a lot of times when preachers get in trouble, they got too much pride for a lot of them to admit they need help. They can get bitter. They can get such hate in their heart, such an unforgiving, uncristlike spirit and they won't turn to anybody. So they preach with bitterness, they preach with hatred, they preach with all this sort of thing. Can you imagine a sermon being filled with that? God help me. God help me. And it's the same with leoty. Leoty can come with in their hearts with bitterness and all kinds of things and they hear things through that filter. But let's open our hearts today and see what Jesus will speak to us. And if your filter is the Holy Ghost, no matter if a preacher's preaching is actually not your favorite preacher and you really don't get that much out of what he has to say, but if you'll let the Holy Ghost be your filter, it's amazing what he can pull through that &gt;&gt; that you yourself would have just totally missed. How many has had it happen to you before? Sure, I have too. God bless you. Let's let's read together. Second Peter chapter 1 verse two. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. And what does godliness mean? To be like God through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue. We're not called to hate. No, we're not called to be troublemakers. I've never found one scripture where Jesus ever said, "Blessed are the troublemakers, &gt;&gt; but blessed are the &gt;&gt; peacemakers, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge, temperance, to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. I was studying last night and I ran across something where brother Ren was addressing the Pentecostal people, his age, and he was talking about the gifts of the spirit. He was talking about how the wonderful they were, marvelous they were. But he had he was preaching on this about the seven virtues. And he said many people want the gifts and seek the gifts without this. And he said without that the gifts can absolutely make a mess. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Turns into confusion, division, all kinds of different things. But he said, "Get this first &gt;&gt; and then it'll produce perfect gifts." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How many wants that in your life today? How many has a need, a desire, request? All right, let's pray together. I've got three prayer claws here today. And the Lord knows all these needs and the seriousness of them. You pray with me, would you? Heavenly Father, as we come before you today, we are so grateful. Oh Jesus, I'm just so happy to be able to be gathered with your saints in your courts. Carol and I was talking about before we come to church and she said, "I'm going to be so happy to come to church." And she said, "It ain't no wonder David said, I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yeah, and think about it. David didn't even have church as we know it. He never even got to go into the holiest of holies. He never got to sense that deep divine presence that the high priest felt. He never got to hear singing in church. He never got to hear testimonies, prayer requests. But they would go and read. But David knew there was something about the house of God, how hallowed, how sacred that it was. I imagine if David had been here in the service today, we'd had a time trying to keep him under control to hear people worshiping and praising, clapping their hands, singing. Oh Jesus, I pray it never becomes common to us. Lord, you see this prayer cause I have in my hand. Father, dear God, we're asking you for your mercy. Lord, all three of these need a divine touch in their lives. Father, Brother John text earlier and Lincoln was up, Lord. A big portion of the night, still vomiting again, and we're praying, Father, in the name of Jesus for our brother. Dear God, you see, he's had all kinds of tests and things, and so far this thing is evaded. And we know what it is. It's nothing but the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. He might hide from a scan. He might hide from a doctor's eye. But he can't hide from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the spirit of God go to him today, Father, and help him &gt;&gt; speak to us through your word, Father, in the name of Jesus, we ask. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. So when brother Brandon was preaching this and he was down at brother Jeffy's house, which was a brother that I was privileged to meet um many years ago down in Kentucky, and he was talking to the brothers there about these virtues. And he was trying to go in every source of course that he knew at the time to find the meanings of the words. And he said he looked through one dictionary and another and finally he said they found one at brother Jeffrey's house to look up godliness what godliness actually meant. And he said that it the meaning that he found was that simply it meant to be like God. So to be like God what an awesome thing. But you think, how in the world could mortals that are born in sin ever be like God? How could we ever even think it possible that something could happen to us and deal with us in such a way that would transform us, change us, and give us a desire to even be like God and then for things to continually unfold in our lives and would become more and more and more like him. And maybe we could see it a little bit clearer by looking at the contrast of darkness and it might help us to see the positivity of the side of light. Now we can see in our world around us every day that the people that are unconverted that are not serving the Lord, they are every day, every week, every month that goes by, this world is becoming more like Satan and his demons. You see it every day when you drive back and forth to work, to school. You see it when you drive to church. People are so self-centered. Where can you find people that drive anymore that even drive courteous? A lot of folks you meet, you know, especially on these Tennessee narrow highways, crooked as a dog's leg, they want their part of the road out of the middle. &gt;&gt; Now, I could understand that if you're in an eight lane highway, but some of these roads that we live and drive on, barely wide enough for two vehicles. And when you want your half out of the middle, well, you know what the rest of us same people do? We head for the ditch. But everywhere you see it, selfishness is so predominant. And I want this and I want that. And it's all about self. People go to church anointed with selfishness. Many preachers get in the pull pit, they preach anointed with selfishness because it's all about them. It's all about their world. It's about their pain. It's about their sorrow. I get sick and tired of hearing all that stuff myself. You know what? To testify, sure. Tell me what you're going through so I can pray for you, but give me something that'll help me to fight what I'm fighting. Okay? Don't just come to church and just tell me a bunch of nonsense. Give me something that's going to give me strength so when I walk out them doors, I can be a better person. I can have something to be able to combat the devil with. But we know that God knew that it was going to be impossible for man, women, boys and girls to ever to display the godliness of the New Testament in the manifestation of the Old Testament. Totally impossible. No way for him to ever do it. So God conserved this type of godliness for it to be made manifest in the New Testament because it was not attainable in the Old. And then even at that, it would seem so overwhelming to some that they would look at it and say, "Well, how is that even possible?" Well, first of all, there must be a new birth, a transformation by which our nature is totally changed. We're born again, and we're, as Paul says, a new creature in Christ Jesus. And as the prophet said, we're a new creation in the same old temple. So something great has happened on the inside of our soul, but that great thing did not actually come to the outside and the body be born again at the same time. Boy, wouldn't that been something wonderful. So we're living actually in this old pest house. And every day of our life, we recognize it more and more. So God knew that in order to release this great power, he himself must first partake of humanity in order for humans to partake of deity. There's only one way it can be done. He himself must condescend to a level that he would take on our humanity, talk our language, eat our food, dress and our clothes, live in our type of structure and and embody himself in a body that would have headaches, pain, anxiety, sorrow, sadness. You imagine Jesus dealt with so much sorrow that the the Bible tells us in the book of Isaiah that he was a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief. So his identification was not that he was a rich man. His identification was not that he was a wealthy man but he was a man of sorrow. He must have had continuous sorrows for this to be his identification. Why is he doing that? in order to display what God would do in a human form. Now remember, he didn't do this maintaining all of those divine attributes which he had in the realm of the eternal before he become a man. Now for us, this is all we've ever known all of our life is humanity, flesh, weakness, failures, and we can't even imagine it really. If you were God, the great eternal, the mighty Elohim, and out of you comes this attribute and you gave birth to a son, which was not another being that looked like you, but it was actually the word. Then that word would make different manifestations in the Old Testament in forms called theophony. He could appear as a light, pillar of fire, bush, all different types of things, clouds. And then he manifested himself in a human body. Then you step down from being the light, the fullness of the godhead bodily. You step down from being all of that to become a human being. And your first breath of human life, a woman gave birth to your body. &gt;&gt; You couldn't feed yourself. You couldn't clothe yourself. A woman had to change your diaper. A woman had to nurse you. For the first time, you were dependent on anyone or anything. And you are the creator of heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; And yet here you were when you come to the earth and you so condescended that you separated yourself from the all- knowing. You separated yourself from all knowledge in so much that the scripture would say in Luke 2:52 that Jesus grew in wisdom and understanding before God and man. And yet he knew everything. &gt;&gt; But he stepped aside from that all knowing and he asked us to sacrifice a little of this and a little bit of that and we just complain and groan. Oh my. Help us Lord Jesus. Now, think that he was going to display godliness. So, how would God act? Look at Jesus and you'll get a good idea. Now, in order to be godly, as we've been looking at it, there's things that that God loves and there's things that God hates. Now, I know we don't hear much about that in the age of living because people want to talk so much about the love of God. And we know the Bible does not say that God is hate. But it does say that God is love. But we do know to be God that he must hate certain things. Notice I'm saying things, not people. So God must hate certain things because it is so against his nature and against who he is and what he is. So then if we are born of his nature, as Peter said, partakers of that divine nature, then we truly to be godly, we will love what he loves and we will hate what he hates. So there were things that will be that will be awful to us, reprehensible. It's things that we cannot even tolerate if we are godly. And the more we become like him, the more godly then we will be. So this is why it's totally impossible say if God loves this our brother here and this brother and this sister and that brother and that brother and that sister and that sister and God loves them and yet we as Christians look at them and we hate them. We're not godly yet. We're not godly the way we should be because we should be able to love those that God loves. Praise the Lord. Is that right? Now, God hates the sins of the sinner, but he loves the sinner itself. As I read to you last week where brother Brandham said that God loves America, but he hates America's sins. And he loves the church, but he hates the church's sin. We seem to have a hard time in separating that. So, here Jesus displayed godliness then, God in human flesh. Read with me if you would in 1 John 2:4. He that saith I know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him. So we don't want truth just in her head but we want truth to be personified so the truth lives out of us out of a predominant nature. So we don't have to even make ourel do it. It's there by that nature of godliness in us. And verse 5, but who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected. You mean a human being keeping the word of God and living the word of God. In that human being is the love of God perfected. How? Because God is living and loving and expressing himself out of that human being. I don't want to just quote John 3:16, but I want to quote First John 3:16. &gt;&gt; How many knows what that even says? A lot of Christians wouldn't. Why? They've never moved into that sphere of godliness yet. They've met him at the altar in sanctification, maybe got blessed, but as far as moving to First John 3:16. Now, we're talking about bride material. Watch in verse six. He that saith, he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walks. You mean God is wanting you and I to walk as he did in heaven? No. On the earth. So on the earth he walked godly yet had sorrow, anxiety, trouble, sickness, got discouraged with people. No doubt felt despondent at times. Is that right? The garden of Gethsemane prayed that the will of God would be somehow possible. Let this cut pass from me. So there's things Jesus knew he was the only one that could fulfill, but he didn't want to do it. &gt;&gt; I said he didn't want to do it. There's things in our life that we feel like God has allocated to us, but there's things in my life I wish it wasn't my lot to fulfill. &gt;&gt; I have to be honest. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said he wish this message was not his to bring. &gt;&gt; So you see people that are chomping at the bits to do something for God, nine times out of 10 they're not even called to do it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Now watch what he done. How he walked in humility. Matthew chap 23:12, "And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased, and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted." You see this is where we come to momentarily here that God said let this same mind you as he anointed Paul to write this. Let this same mind which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant. Notice again James 4:6 he says but he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but he giveth grace unto the humble. Now God himself by the nature of the Holy Ghost living in our regenerated life gives us a degree of humility by birth. But much of the economy of God and our life of service is not going to be on that humility through the Holy Ghost. It will be on our own personal humility that we humble ourselves. &gt;&gt; Well, glory. And God will never do that. &gt;&gt; Only we can. &gt;&gt; So, we humble ourselves or we exalt ourselves. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice James 4:10. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. So truly the way up is down. &gt;&gt; Now, it depends on the order you have it. If you've got it down, then you'll be up. If you've got it up, you'll be down. &gt;&gt; If we humble ourselves, he will lift us. If we exalt ourselves, he will humble us. &gt;&gt; So you and I have the choice today, even as the people of God, that we can choose humility or we can be humbled, which is not the same thing. You see, if we by choice choose humility, it automatically renders to us divine exaltation. If we choose human exaltation, it automatically renders to us God is going to humble us. &gt;&gt; Woo! I hate that kind of humbling, don't you? Wow. BUT IF WE'RE CHILDREN OF GOD, he's going to do us because he loves us. &gt;&gt; Now, notice how Peter says in 1 Peter 5:5, "Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves unto the elder." Now remember this is totally contrary than it would be to Hebrews the way that they would have thought cuz the younger people coming up to elders I mean they didn't have nothing. They didn't have nothing to say. You couldn't hardly say anything in front of an older person. You just was dumb and that's just the way it was. But notice what Christianity did. It's reversing the roles to where it's taking away a hierarchy that was so in the Hebrew ranks. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder, and yay, all of you be subject one to another. So here and now he turns it right back around and saying now look it's not going to be a carryover of Hebrewism but it's going to be a divine interruption of the spirit of God that each of you no matter what your position is you'll be able to humble yourself and realize you're servants to one another be subject one to another and be clothed with humility humility. The having a humble opinion of oneself, &gt;&gt; a deep sense of one's moral littleness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. This is good stuff. &gt;&gt; Modesty, loneliness of mind. Now, if you want to know if some people think they are great or not, ask them. &gt;&gt; They will definitely tell you. &gt;&gt; It ain't no wonder we don't go on with God &gt;&gt; and get more godly. &gt;&gt; But you see, we think as long as our dress is the right length. &gt;&gt; And thankfully this morning, none of our brothers wore skirts to church. Hopefully they don't do it at home either. They wear no dresses, earrings, and so on and so on. And we look at this and that and WE DETERMINE THAT'S GODLY. WHAT A GODLY person &gt;&gt; really. &gt;&gt; How many do you know in dresses and how many men do you know that would never put on lipstick? &gt;&gt; Although manicures and all that sort of thing is becoming very popular for men. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Used to be just Maybelline was for women. Not anymore. &gt;&gt; The men of the age, bunch of sissified perverts. They have their own line makeup and their own line of lipstick and all that sort of thing. Bunch of sissies. &gt;&gt; Preach. Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; But yet, HOW MANY OF US WOULD SAY, "OH, WHAT A GODLY PERSON. WHAT A GODLY PERSON." AND YET YOU talk to them a little bit and a half of their conversation is about themsel &gt;&gt; testing one two. Is my mic working okay to tell you? All right. All right. &gt;&gt; Notice be clothed with humility for God resistance. So can you imagine God actually resists the proud? Look at the word proud. &gt;&gt; Showing oneself above others. &gt;&gt; Over topping. &gt;&gt; Over topping. &gt;&gt; Conspicuous above others. Preeminent with an overwhelming estimate of one's means or merits. I've preached for so many years. I've done this. I pray for this person. God showed me that. I've done this. I've done that and the other. So what if our nation passed a law? Everybody who makes under 250k a year loses citizenship. &gt;&gt; Most of us would be in Somalia, wouldn't we? &gt;&gt; Ethiopia, Nigeria. And yet the Lord Jesus looks at his people and his economy and some of the poorest on the earth &gt;&gt; are his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, the Lord Jesus never even owned a house. The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nest, but the son of man hath now where to lay his head. &gt;&gt; I realize a lot of the folks at panhandle on the days that we live and stand and I will work by food. Have you noticed how many of them signs have changed? You don't find many of them signs anymore. I'll work for food. They're just going and asking for your money and they ain't going to work for it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But I never pass by those signs whether on university or wherever they are. you and I got their favorite spots never and think if I would have looked at the Lord Jesus in his day. He'd have probably dressed like some of them people saw one yesterday I'm hungry and I'm homeless. Then Carol was talking about I told her I said you realize in reality some of them may be actors and lying but if the Lord Jesus would have stood up with a sign his son would have said that &gt;&gt; I'm homeless I'm rejected I'm hated I'm despised of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and We stick up our nose in the air and look down upon people that we go to church with &gt;&gt; cuz they don't dress as nice as we do. &gt;&gt; Who are we? &gt;&gt; Godliness. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 5:6. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time. I love these words that Paul uses in Philippians 2:6. Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God. Now he tells us to let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. And this mind is a mind of self emptying. the mind of self emptying to where no matter how much God blesses you, whether it's financially or in the spiritual realm, that you're constantly selfmping. So you never allow yourself to be exalted above measure. I'm this, I'm that, I'm the other. He said, "Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation." Look at the words that Paul chooses to use to describe our Lord Jesus. Look at what this word here, reputation means. Kenu, which is the word where brother Brandham got the word kenosis. Look at what it means to empty. Make empty. Deprive of force. Cause a thing to be seen. To be seen to be empty, hollow. So the Lord Jesus self emptied &gt;&gt; to give the appearance that he was hollow. You imagine Peter could have woke up every morning and traveling around with him and let's say this morning when he woke up and he got up out of their cot maybe rolled out and he looked and he said, "Lord Jesus, look at that sunrise. That sun breaking across the east there." Jesus could have said, "I made that." &gt;&gt; And he could have said, "Listen to whipperwill. Listen at the birds. Listen at this." Jesus could have said, "I actually gave him that song. I composed it." And I made his his little beak and his little throat where it could quiver to produce the vibr as it would come out of his little beak. Oh, you gave him that song. Yeah, it's been a long time ago, but I still remember the chords. &gt;&gt; We said, "Lord, listen at that one." There it is. I wrote that song, too. that in the evening the moon could have come out the stars and he could have said WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WHAT a beautiful moon is. He could have said I made that. They could said look at those stars and said I made all them but we have not one place recorded. &gt;&gt; Whoever told us any great thing that he himself did. As a matter of fact, if other people had not wrote about him, we would have never had one line that he ever wrote talking about what he ever did. &gt;&gt; Godliness. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He made all the cattle on the hills, all the fish in the sea, and yet he humbled himself to catch them. &gt;&gt; So he could have said, "I'd like fish for dinner." And just spoke. it have jumped out, fried itself, salt and peppered itself, but instead he humbled himself to use in a net. Don't you see every aspect of his life and he made everything everything? &gt;&gt; So, did the world need another carpenter? Did the world need another fisherman? &gt;&gt; Did the world need another great king that would come and be like all the rest of them and would be a despot that would punish the poor and exalt the rich? And did the world need that? &gt;&gt; Oh, the world needed God. BUT NOT GOD IN ME LIKE THE OLD TESTAMENT, but God in the form of a man. &gt;&gt; Notice Paul says, "But he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant." So the word servant is dulos, a bondman, a slave, a man of survile condition. Metaphorically one who gives himself up to another's will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. and was made in the likeness of men. Verse eight, and being found in fashion. [crying] Now, I want you to notice how that Paul when he writes this in verse six, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation. So one emptying leaving the pre-incarnate state of what he was the great eternal he emptied himself and then after he comes to the earth he still carries out the same act of condensation that when he once he gets here he's still emptying or brother Johnny when will I attain to this will it be a one-time thing No, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; It'll actually be ongoing as long as you're here. &gt;&gt; You see, this is a divine process that goes on in regenerated human beings. That's where people backslide. Whenever they come to a certain spot and they think, "Oh, well, I've got saved. I got saved. I've got the Holy Ghost. I'm doing really good." And then maybe they start, you know, maybe they're a singer and their singing is really blessed by God. And if they're not careful, they'll become bigger and bigger and bigger in their own eyes. Bigger and bigger and bigger. And then they'll start relying more upon their own ability. And they think, "Well, I don't need the anointing anymore." You'd be surprised the message preachers that I've heard about that say they don't need the anointing no more to preach. I hope I never get to that spot. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't feel that way about your own walk with God. Oh, I don't need the anointing. Yes, you do. Every day of your life, SO IT WASN'T THAT HE DID IT ONE TIME, but it was constantly ongoing. And this is where he wants us TO STAY. SAME WITH PREACHERS. Can't you understand why preachers we've seen them rise and fall and they topple like dominoes. CAN'T YOU SEE WHY GOD WILL GO TO USING A man and maybe it's in a gifted to preach and and maybe others it' be gifted to pray for people and gifted in this way and that way and that way. And if God blesses them and they get greater and greater, more signs, more wonders, more conventions or whatever it is, however God's gifted them, and if they don't keep this idea right here before them, CONSTANTLY SELFMPING AND GOD'S giving them more and THEY'RE SELF-MPING AND GOD'S MAKING THEM GREATER and their ministry, their understanding, and so on and SO ON. BUT HOW MANY HAVE WE seen in our own ranks, the bigger they get, the more they know it? The bigger they get, the more they think they know, till they get to a place they're not even subject to the word no more and cannot receive correction from anybody, &gt;&gt; including God. &gt;&gt; Now, when we get so big we can't take correction from God, we're in a world of hurt. Friends, &gt;&gt; I hope none of us, including the man talking to you today, EVER GETS TO A SPOT THAT WE CANNOT be corrected by the Holy Ghost. You agree with this? &gt;&gt; Oh God. So already by his emptying the canosis now he humbles himself. not only took on the form of man but now it goes into the lowest stage of man to take on the form of a servant. To become king God to King Jesus to go straight TO A THRONE UPON THE EARTH WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AN ACT OF CONDENSATION. But to come from that great eternal to become a man and having no place to lay your head AS WE SAID AND to be ridiculed and misunderstood AND CRITICIZED AND TALKED ABOUT AND AND WENT STRAIGHT TO A THRONE. THAT'S STILL BEEN AN ACT OF CONDENSATION, but rather to go to a not a throne but a cross and become a serpent &gt;&gt; on the pole. Demonology part two paragraph 199. &gt;&gt; And I think when how God sent Jesus to hell &gt;&gt; because of his sins. Not sins that he had done, but because of our sins. &gt;&gt; And who were we? A sixft pile of dirt, &gt;&gt; 4 and 1/2t pile of dirt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; And being found, notice, being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself. So coming in the form of man was a great act of humility. But then after he was found in the fashion of man, he humbled himself again. When did it stop? When he went down to hell. &gt;&gt; What did God do? He raised him so high the angels have to oh glory to God bow down to his name. [clears throat] Everything in heaven and earth is called after his name. Reward for humility. &gt;&gt; He showed us how to live like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure some of you have probably heard it, maybe some not, but TL Osborne makes some of the most astounding statements at Brother Brandham's memorial service about the way that brother Brandham lived. And he talked about how the preachers come and preach and so on. But he said William Brandham did not just do miracles and signs and but he showed us God &gt;&gt; in flesh. &gt;&gt; A man who could have been a millionaire. A man WHO COULD HAVE BEEN WHATEVER HE WOULD HAVE WANTED. &gt;&gt; But what did he find the key to? Humbling himself. Imagine they bring a million and a half dollars to him and he tells them to take it back. HE WAS OFFERED THIS THAT THE OTHER. WHAT DO HE DO? TURN IT ALL DOWN. WHY? In order to stay small and humble &gt;&gt; where God could use him. How many of us want that kind of spirit? &gt;&gt; Notice the word humble. Tapping me. A base. Bring low. To make low. Metaphorically to bring into A HUMBLE CONDITION. REDUCED TO meaner circumstances. To assign a lower rank or place to to be ranked below others who are honored or rewarded. To have a modest opinion of oneself. to behave in an unassuming manner devoid of all hauliness. &gt;&gt; The more we go on, I wonder more I wonder how many be there'll ever be &gt;&gt; that'll ever to attain to such a stuff. But there will be some. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, there'll be some. &gt;&gt; Notice in Luke 22:27, for whether is greater he that siteth at meat or he that serveth? The Lord Jesus talking to the disciples now. Is not he that siteth at meat, but I am among you is the one that serveth. May God help every God call man around this message to always maintain &gt;&gt; this view right here of our Lord Jesus. It's no wonder to me, brother Dave, that whenever the Lord Jesus had the last supper, and the Bible says he gets a towel and he girds himself and he bows down on his knees, something maybe like this. And he gets a pan of water and he comes to Peter and looks him up in the face. And Peter said, "You will never wash my feet." Are you being a footwash funky Jesus? This is beneath you. You're the GREAT KING. YOU'RE THE GREAT ALL THESE GREAT THINGS, PETER. If I don't wash you, you have no part with me. &gt;&gt; What was he showing them? Brother Rob, those that you may seem to [clears throat] look upon and THINK THEY'RE SUCH GREAT MIGHTY men &gt;&gt; when they get to where they cannot wash the feets &gt;&gt; of God's children. I ain't talking about just naturally. I'm talking about you all are not called to be my servants. Come on. I am called to be yours. &gt;&gt; Every preacher, not just pastors, is called to be the servants &gt;&gt; to God's people. &gt;&gt; But some preachers want to be potentates, kings, kingdoms. There's only one kingdom I'm interested in today. &gt;&gt; And it ain't the kingdom of Donnie Reagan. It ain't the kingdom of no other preacher. &gt;&gt; It's the kingdom of the Lord Jesus. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. You see, when he did this, he emptied himself of all symbols of divinity. So if you'd have been around the Lord Jesus and saw him working as a man, you'd have saw sweat roll down his face. hot days, drier Mediterranean climate. You'd have been around him and been out in the heat of the day and his human body, you would have probably smelt a body odor. &gt;&gt; Jesus would have needed to take a bath. &gt;&gt; HIS STOMACH WAS LIKE YOURS AND MINE. He would have got hungry. &gt;&gt; He would have got thirsty, weary. Oh, God. So he could not just I done this and I'd done that and I'd done what did he say? I do nothing until my father shows me. &gt;&gt; I can't do this on my own. &gt;&gt; Not saying he couldn't &gt;&gt; in the preexisting form before the work of incarnation. But he laid that aside. HE LIVED ON THE EARTH AS A MAN FOR 30 years without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Godliness. &gt;&gt; How many wants it? Though he was God appearing in the form of a man, a divine person on earth, he did nothing to assume the representation of divinity or even his rights that preexisted before he come here like that. Notice in Romans 5:19, "For as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience, Uh-oh." &gt;&gt; Here's another act of condensation. God [screaming] obeying. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; obeying By the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. HEBREWS 5:8. THOUGH HE WERE A SON, yet learned he obedience by what? By the things which he suffered. Almighty God condescended in such a state of humanity that he had to learn things. &gt;&gt; The true and original knowit all. &gt;&gt; The only one there ever was or ever will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the know-it-all come down and had to come to a spot, brother Da. Brother Dao, that his mama had to teach him letters. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You imagine as a little boy, his mother was teaching him Aramaic. He's the one who gave the original languages. He's the one who put all this together. You imagine Jesus as a little boy. Uh Colin learned it. Of course, what they would say was, "Ema, Emma." Jesus stuttering as a little boy. Jesus learning the phrases. Jesus, you know, his mama homeschooling him probably the way he was taught. His mama teaching him one plus one. Jesus, how much? I don't know, mama. I don't know. One plus one. Jesus, you've got to learn this. 1 plus one. But after he learned it, he could take a few loaves and a few fishes. Boy, did he learn how to multiply. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. BUT HE ALSO KNEW addition and subtraction. And he knew that if you COME TO THIS LIFE TO BE A SERVANT TO GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO SUBTRACT. YOU'VE GOT TO DIVIDE YOURSELF FROM WHAT YOU WERE AND SUBTRACT AND HUMBLE YOURSELF. AND BY DOING SO, IT WILL PRODUCE DIVINE MULTIP MULTIPLICATION AND DIVINE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN. MAY GOD HELP US AS THE PEOPLE OF GOD THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND DIVINE MATHEMATICS. WELL, I HATE TO GIVE UP THIS AND I HATE TO GIVE UP THAT. YOU KNOW, to need to go to math school and that THE LORD JESUS TEACH YOU, IF YOU FORSAKE ALL MEN FOR ME, I WILL CONFESS YOUR NAME BEFORE THE FATHER. I WILL STAND THERE AND BE A WITNESS FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH. BUT PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, I GOT TO GIVE UP THIS. I GOT TO GIVE UP THAT." THEY AIN'T LEARNED math yet. But if you understand it the RIGHT WAY, YOU GIVE UP THIS LITTLE SOMETHING, HE'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING SO MUCH GREATER. YOU FOREGO THIS AND HE WILL MULTIPLY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. [applause] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? In his incarnate state, he surrendered his right to manifest himself visibly in divine glory and splendor. Oh, I know how I feel when I get to get into his presence. You know the same because you've been there. Can you imagine on Mount Transfiguration, Brother Larry, as he was able at the father's choice at the right moment to enter into that glory which he had laid aside and been out of for so long. And all of the sudden, the father sends down a little future taste of what his coming kingdom. Isn't it amazing? He could have CHOSE ALL TYPES OF SCENARIOS to send down a little foretaste of divinity, but he knew what would mean the most to the Lord Jesus. Heavenly divine glory foreshadowed in his future kingdom in type. Peter, James, John, Elijah, Moses, resurrected saints, dead saints. And what did Jesus GET A FORETASTE OF? HIS KINGDOM with his bride. AMEN. THAT WAS THE APOSTLES UP THERE, THE NATURAL ONES AND AND UNCONVERTED BODIES. And there lays the others down there a perfect despion of the kingdom that WAS TO COME. AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS, JESUS WAS ABLE to enter in to that divine glory which he had separated himself from by choice. Don't ever forget this. JESUS WAS NOT A MARTYR. JESUS WAS NOT A MARTYR. HIS LIFE WAS NOT TAKEN from him. &gt;&gt; He gave it. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE? WHAT GOD ONE OF THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE between the bride and the church? Many of them are martyrs. They have to be made to do this, MADE TO DO THAT, MADE TO DO THIS, MADE TO DO THAT. GOD DON'T WANT HIS BRIDE to be martyrs. &gt;&gt; He wants us to willingly give him whatever he wants. WHY? THAT'S THE WAY HE DID. It's our ability to selfmp. Read with me and I'll find a place of closure in a bit. Isaiah 53:2. Let's read about Jehovah's servant in service for death. For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor clumlinist. But when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. So even when he come, he did not come as a handsome man. A man that people would look at him and say, "Oh wow, LOOK WHAT A PRINCE. MY LOOK AT THAT JAWBONE. LOOK AT THAT CHIN. Look at that. When brother Brandham saw him in the sagebrush field &gt;&gt; and he looked on him, he said with the features and the face that he had, it was a man that you'd look at him and kind of feel sorry for him with pity. Not a profile of a rock and roll star or a Hollywood star. Oh, hallelujah. HE HAS DESPISED AND REJECTED A MAN, A MAN OF sorrows and acquainted with grief. WE HID AS IT WERE OUR FACES FROM HIM. &gt;&gt; So we hid from him. WE HID AS IT WERE OUR FACES FROM HIM. HE WAS DESPISED AND WE ESTEEMED HIM NOT. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken, [snorts] smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray and we have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord has laid ON HIM THE INIQUITY OF US ALL. HE WAS OPPRESSED AND HE was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth. He has brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb. So he openeth not his mouth. And yet out of his mouth went the universe, the stars, all the greatness of creation. But now he chose not to say a thing. He was taken from prison and from judgment. who shall declare his generation? FOR HE WAS CUT OFF OF THE land of the living. Listen to this. For the transgression of my people. He was SENT TO THE EARTH FOR A PURPOSE. He was cut off for the transgression of my people. Was he stricken. He made his grave with the wicked and with the rich IN HIS DEATH BECAUSE HE HAD DONE NO VIOLENCE, neither was there any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He hath put him TO GRIEF WHEN THOU SHALT MAKE HIS SOUL, NOT JUST his blood, &gt;&gt; not just his flesh, his soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An offering for sin. Can't you see the lamb would come up and the man in the Old Testament would lay his hand on the heads of that lamb and the blood would gush OUT ALL OVER HIM. BUT THE MAN'S nature was not changed because the lamb did not have a soul. The blood SPOKE AS A CHEMISTRY AS A PAINT. But when that lamb HUNG UPON THE CROSS, ELI ELI [screaming] SEBASTI, MY GOD, MY GOD, why is thou forsaken me? His soul is being offered for AN ATONEMENT. WHY? SO THAT you and I could come down here 2,000 YEARS LATER AND PARTAKE OF THAT SAME SOUL, THAT SAME NATURE OF THE LORD JESUS, NOT JUST TO PAINT AND US GO ON LIVING OUR SAME SINFUL LIVES, BUT BEING BORN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD, FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BE PARTAKERS of the divine nature and live WHAT KIND OF LIFE? A LIFE OF [screaming] GODLINESS. Praise God. [sighs] [panting] &gt;&gt; Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He has put him decree. For thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin. He shall see his seed. He shall prolong his days. And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied. By his knowledge shall my righteous servant servant. Justify many. For he shall bear their &gt;&gt; iniquities. &gt;&gt; He didn't just take your drinking. He didn't just take your immorality. &gt;&gt; He wanted to take one of man's greatest faults, pride, &gt;&gt; arrogance. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong. That's the kind of king he is. &gt;&gt; He who deserved all the glory. But he said, "Father, I don't want it all. I would that they would be with me where I am, but I don't want them to be empty-handed. Father, I want to give them things. &gt;&gt; I want to reward them. I don't want them just to have life. I want to give them things. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong. Notice the divine ORDER OF GODHEAD. GOD THE FATHER THE ETERNAL WHICH COULD NOT DIE SAID I WILL GIVE him and then he will give &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO. GOD HAS GIVEN US LIFE AND HE WANTS US TO TURN AROUND TRY TO SHARE IT WITH OTHERS. TRY TO SHARE ENCOURAGEMENT. Don't go around beating PEOPLE DOWN ALL THE TIME. TRY TO LIFT THEM UP. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death. He was numbered with the transgressors, and he bare the sin not of everybody, but of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. I found this in studying in a book called Wilmington's Handbook of the Bible. I thought it was really good. I wanted to share it with you this morning. He left heaven's glory for earth's poverty. He made himself nothing or emptied himself. He hid his heavenly fame in an earthly frame. [laughter] Even though he retained every single attribute of deity while on earth, he surrendered the independent exercise of those divine characteristics. He took the humble position of a slave. It did not come as a mighty human king or philosopher but as a lowly servant. He taught our language, wore our clothes, ate our food, breathed our air, and endured our vicious treatment. After Paul talks about in humbling himself in Philippians 2:9, then Paul says, "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name. That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of the things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth. and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Let's stand together." [applause] &gt;&gt; Down from his glory area. Hebrews chapter 2 verse 9. But we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. The word lower is to make less or inferior in dignity, to decrease in authority or popularity. So we see Jesus who was made a little lower. Can you imagine? He didn't just come down beneath his own position, but even the angels would look down on him. lower than the angels. Verse 10, for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. And the word captain literally means pioneer. One who opens the way for others to follow. In verse 11, for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one. For which cause? He is not ashamed to call them brethren. So how does it feel to be called brothers and sisters of God? You see, it should not exalt our flesh. It should not exalt our pride. It should humble us. For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one, which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren. Paul goes on to tell us, "For he [snorts] by one offering hath perfected forever [snorts] them that are sanctified. He is not ashamed of you." But brother Donnie, I've made so many mistakes. Even that don't make him ashamed. But I've fallen short. Me too. Me too. &gt;&gt; I've got family members I don't mind telling you. They've embarrassed me. I got cousins, uncles, different people in my family on both sides. They've done things, said things, behaved in such way it's it's it's embarrassed me. They'd probably say the same thing about me. But there's something about Jesus and the way that he looks at his love, which you are. His love, the love of his heart, not only took my shame when he was here, but now he's here for me today to help me. And even when I fall flat on my face, he's there to say, "Donnie, get up. Come on, get up. You messed up. I knew you would. But I forgive you, &gt;&gt; Lord. I can't go back to church. Oh. Oh, everybody will know. Everybody will know. Are you serving everybody or are you serving me? &gt;&gt; Sure, there's shame and humiliation when we mess up. We just have to bear it. Just bear it. Come on back. &gt;&gt; You're coming to church where everybody else does the same thing. It's just different things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Church is sort of like a hospital. &gt;&gt; A lot of ER services, you know. &gt;&gt; I mean, you go to a doctor every now and then for a well visit, right? I went not long ago for a well visit to see my doctor. I like him. Really nice doctor. Brother William Smith's got got him in with me. My doctor retired. Really nice guy. Christian guy. Where where you been? Where you been going? You taking care of William? I said, man, you've asked me a hard thing, boy. You got anything wrong? Nope. Got any complaints? Nope. Nurses come in. Blood pressure's good. Heart this, this, everything good? Anything you want to tell the doctor? Nope. Well visit. Most people come to this church don't come to church for well visits. &gt;&gt; It's ER, ET, ED. I mean, they've got everything in the world going on. They feel like they're losing their mind. They're losing their home. They're losing everything in the world's ER service. I'VE GOT TO TALK TO BROTHER Jim Urgent. You don't ask me. I ask brother Jim Witson. They use them words all the TIME ON HIM. IT'S ABSOLUTELY EMERGENCY. I'VE GOT TO SEE BROTHER Donnie today. &gt;&gt; But you know what? I don't mind our church being like a hospital. I don't mind it at all. I just want to be the right kind of ER doctor. &gt;&gt; Come on. So when you get here, God will help me in his divine mercy to know how to administer to you what you have need of. I'm willing to roll up my sleeves and if you've had an accident, you've busted your mouth all over your face and you you've done this and that and the other. I I'm willing to get involved in your blood. I'm willing to get involved in your mess. I tell Carol all the time sometimes I feel like I work for the sanitation department of heaven from some of the stuff I have to deal with. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; But somebody's got to do it. &gt;&gt; Cuz I ain't just looking at you at your struggles now and what you are by a supernatural uncction. I believe one day I'm going to be looking at some of you same people walking down streets of gold and you and I will take off for a walk and we'll go walking down them beautiful streets and as brother Ram kind of gave an analogy of it at one of his sisters there when we get up around Papa's throne and said to go by some of the one of the sisters I sister so and so said oh we we haven't seen you for a couple thousand years were you what you been doing. So, I've been right here by my flower garden for the last 10,000 years. I just been here taking care of things. You imagine, friends, there'll be no alarm clocks. There'll be no beds cuz we don't be won't be sleeping. There'll be no place to go. There'll be no sickness. We'll just be fellowshipping for eternity. will have houses, parks, streams, trees, animals. Hallelujah. I plan on seeing you there. You won't look like you do today. Your glasses will be gone. Your contacts will be gone. Your wrinkles, mine, too. And we'll be forever young. But let's come this way by ourselves and he will exalt us in due time. Thank you Lord Jesus. down from his glory.

We worship you [music] father my [singing] all and all [music] the great [singing] creator. [music] He became hallelujah Jesus. [music] Thank you Lord Jesus. Dwell [singing] us in me. [music] Dearly beloved, we are gathered here on the side of God and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in the holy state of matrimony which is commanded in the scripture to be entered into reverently, discreetly, and in the fear of God. These two persons present have come to be joined together today in this union. Believing you have considered this solemn obligation, I will present to you the marriage covenant. Lord Jesus, will you have this woman to be your lawful wed? Will you love her? Will you care for her? Will you cherish her? Will you actually serve her and becoming her atonement and her sacrifice for reconciliation? Do you promise to keep her, to love her, to put her above all others so long as eternity rolls on? He said, "I do. Will you, Hallelujah, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband? Do you promise to love him, to serve him, forsaking all others, and cleave thee only unto him so long as you both shall live? &gt;&gt; Will you put him above your mother, &gt;&gt; your father, yourself, your cousins, your aunts, your uncles, your job? &gt;&gt; You will give your all to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will require a token. &gt;&gt; In this case, there's only one ring in this wedding, and the Lord Jesus is providing it. I will tell you what's inscribed upon this ring. A little tiny inscription on the inside. Oh, how awesome. I've married a lot of people and I've seen different inscriptions. I don't think I've ever seen one quite like this. What a strange thing. It says, "I loved her before the foundation of the world." &gt;&gt; And actually, I slipped this ring on her &gt;&gt; word fingering &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you. &gt;&gt; For as much as Jesus Christ, the Almighty God, and his blood washed bride, have consented together by giving an exchanging of rings and exchanging their vows. I pronounce they are men and wife. You may kiss your bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now they turn and walk up to the edge of eternity. Ladies and gentlemen, cereubams, saraphims, angelic host, I present to you Mr. and miseries Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And before long here they will go away. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Jesus may be telling her this as they walk down the aisle. Come away, my love. the table spread in splendor. I've got a great big banquet already lined out for you, darling. [laughter] Thousands of miles long. There's your loved ones, your friends. Come, darling. Let's go away. Come away.
