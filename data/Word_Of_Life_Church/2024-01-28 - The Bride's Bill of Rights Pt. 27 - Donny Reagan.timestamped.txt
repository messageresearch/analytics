[47:53] Lord Heavenly Father we we count it such
[47:56] an
[47:58] honor to be sitting at the table of the
[48:02] Lord that song of course been taken from
[48:05] the
[48:07] story of David a great king who heard
[48:12] about his friend Jonathan's
[48:16] son his maid had taken care of him had
[48:21] fallen with him and made him
[48:24] crippled
[48:26] and David heard that there was an heir
[48:28] of Jonathan left so he brings this
[48:31] crippled young man to dine at the king's
[48:37] table our
[48:39] mother fell with

[48:46] Afflicted but one day the
[48:49] master called and said come and eat with
[48:53] me come and set with me dine with me be

[49:20] restaurant and we will bow our heads and
[49:24] thank you for the food food that we're
[49:26] about to

[49:30] we're bowing our heads thanking you for
[49:34] the spiritual food that we're going to
[49:36] receive
[49:37] today you know our needs that they are
[49:40] many but we know that our God is so
[49:43] powerful and so
[49:45] wonderful I pray you'd come and take
[49:47] charge of the service Lord help me to
[49:50] get out of the way help the people as
[49:52] well to be able to get out of the way as
[49:54] John brother John has already prayed for
[49:57] we know it takes them pulling as well to
[50:01] receive help us today Jesus we open our
[50:04] hearts to your word speak to us father
[50:08] as only you can do we ask in Jesus name
[50:12] amen God bless you we are truly blessed
[50:16] aren't we to be able to be children of
[50:19] God Feast at the table of the king let's
[50:22] turn to 1 John 2:5 today greet you in
[50:25] the name of the Lord
[50:27] Jesus certainly love you and appreciate
[50:29] you thank God for his Mercy to
[50:32] us I'd like to speak to you again today
[50:35] on the right to perfect
[50:39] love the right to perfect
[50:42] love 1 John 2 verse
[50:46] 5 who so
[50:49] keepeth his
[50:51] word and him
[50:54] verily is the the love of
[50:56] God
[50:59] perfected now it's not just everybody
[51:01] that says they believe it even those
[51:04] that would maybe scream and holler amen
[51:07] and all of that but the way John phrases
[51:10] it he says who so keepe us that is take
[51:14] it as your own guard it watch over it
[51:19] and keep it as a sacred
[51:21] trust who so keepeth his word in him
[51:26] verily is the love of God perfected
[51:30] hereby know we know not guess but know
[51:35] we that we are in him 1 John chter
[51:41] 4 verse
[51:43] 12 no man hath seen God at any time if
[51:47] we love one another God dwelleth in us
[51:51] and his love is perfected
[51:56] in us his love is perfected in US verse
[52:00] 16 we have known and believed the love
[52:04] that God hath to us God is love and he
[52:10] that
[52:11] dwelleth in love I know I've shared this
[52:14] meaning of this word but let's look at
[52:15] it again if you don't mind today abide
[52:18] remain continue to remain not to depart
[52:23] to continue to be present
[52:25] not to become another or different so he
[52:29] that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[52:34] and God in him may the Lord bless his
[52:38] word you may be
[52:47] seated now I realize this is totally
[52:51] impossible for any of us today to every
[52:55] never be able to attain to perfect love
[53:01] it's something beyond what we can reach
[53:03] none of us are born with the human
[53:07] capacity to be able to love in a perfect
[53:10] way most of our world most of our life
[53:13] is filled with imperfect things you have
[53:17] a flawed Pastor flawed deacons flawed
[53:22] musicians I preach to flawed
[53:27] sheep your wife is flawed your husband
[53:31] is flawed your children are flawed our
[53:35] leaders our government it's flawed every
[53:38] man of God that ever stood on the Earth
[53:41] was flawed there was only one that ever
[53:43] lived here that was perfect and he gave
[53:46] his perfect life that he might bring us
[53:49] to this aren't you glad but still when
[53:52] we look at it to think that we are
[53:54] called
[53:55] to be able to love in a way that only
[53:58] God could love and I know that most of
[54:01] us probably struggle in some Avenues of
[54:05] our life when it would come to love now
[54:09] we know that there are gifts and thank
[54:12] God for gifts of the Spirit and thank
[54:14] God for talents and anointing and all of
[54:17] that and we know we must have that the
[54:20] Lord Jesus put that in his body but one
[54:23] day there will be no more preaching
[54:26] there'll be no preaching in heaven
[54:28] there'll be no speaking in tongues or
[54:30] interpretation uh somebody trying to
[54:32] find the word of the Lord for somebody
[54:35] there won't be any of that but what will
[54:37] there be in heaven we will come back to
[54:40] this perfect love it will never die you
[54:44] see the Antichrist can be able to
[54:46] reproduce and mimic any gift that God
[54:50] has but the devil cannot love it's not
[54:55] any is just not capable of loving and
[54:58] yet God demands of us as his people that
[55:03] we have a perfect love now we've done
[55:04] looked at the meaning of this words and
[55:06] know that perfect is tellos which means
[55:08] complete mature or grown up it's not
[55:12] talking about Flawless but it's talking
[55:14] about a mature love a Divine love that's
[55:18] what it is now if you could understand
[55:20] it in this way when the Lord came to the
[55:22] Earth that he came as the very fountain
[55:25] of love and he come to make us that we
[55:29] unlovable he come to make us lovable so
[55:32] in the state that we were in we were not
[55:36] very lovable and we all can be honest
[55:39] I'm sure and say that there's certain
[55:41] people that we have an easier time
[55:44] loving is there anybody that'll be
[55:46] honest and shake your head at least and
[55:48] say yeah that that's right there are
[55:50] certain people that I can love easier
[55:52] than other others and yet you're real
[55:55] love is not proven by loving those
[55:58] people actually the greatest test of
[56:02] your true love is loving those that
[56:05] aren't as lovable now what makes it very
[56:08] difficult is sometimes we might have
[56:10] family members that aren't as lovable as
[56:14] other people are and some family members
[56:16] will be more lovable than others some
[56:19] preachers are more lovable than others
[56:21] some people are more lovable I'm talking
[56:24] about the human element now but the love
[56:26] of God has the capability of loving
[56:30] those that are unlovable let me share a
[56:33] few of these things with you this
[56:34] morning God is a lover God is love and
[56:38] God so loved the world that when we were
[56:40] unlovable that he gave his son to make
[56:44] them lovable so God so loved the world
[56:49] now whenever the Bible tells us that it
[56:51] was Jesus of course speaking it then he
[56:53] was speaking it from the first person
[56:56] knowing that the world wasn't lovable
[56:59] and the truth of it is the majority of
[57:01] the world still isn't lovable today
[57:04] they're so wrapped up in their self and
[57:06] their sin and what they want to do and
[57:09] God cannot love sin God Can Love The
[57:12] Sinner is that right but God cannot love
[57:15] sin and God does not love our sin either
[57:18] as Christians God does not love sin but
[57:21] he does Love The Sinner and he has the
[57:23] ability to separate that sometimes we
[57:26] struggle with that so if people do
[57:29] things that we don't like and they're
[57:31] not lovable maybe in Avenues of their
[57:33] life we tend to cast them in the same
[57:37] tub as it were of their sin and say well
[57:40] I just don't like them and I don't love
[57:43] them well we need to be more like God to
[57:45] where that we can be able to separate
[57:48] them from what they're doing and
[57:49] eventually of course the love of God
[57:52] becomes mature in our lives and it'll
[57:54] produce a group of people over the face
[57:56] of the Earth and they'll be Rapture
[57:58] Ready Now notice the prophet goes on to
[58:00] say here it is God wants to come down
[58:03] and make love to you he's seeking
[58:07] thirsting hungering trying to get to
[58:10] some of your starchy Hearts to make love
[58:15] to you as a love affair not a law but a
[58:20] love it's all love God so love the Lord
[58:24] don't want to to serve him out of fear
[58:27] what man that's it's married here in
[58:29] this building today would want his wife
[58:31] to constantly have to be told tell me
[58:34] that you love me tell me that you love
[58:36] me what woman here would want her
[58:39] husband or what which of you parents
[58:41] would constantly want have to ask your
[58:43] children children do you love me do you
[58:46] care for me children what Pastor would
[58:48] want that what sheep would want that
[58:51] from their Pastor they want to hear it
[58:54] from me you want to hear it from me
[58:56] right that I love you I want to hear it
[58:59] from you that you love me my wife wants
[59:02] to hear it from me I want to hear it
[59:04] from her God wants to hear it from us
[59:08] God doesn't want the song leader to have
[59:11] to get up or the preacher and Pull and
[59:14] beg and and do everything just to get a
[59:17] little praise out of us or a little bit
[59:19] of worship there's something wrong with
[59:21] us when that has to be done it ought to
[59:24] be Auto atic that we love him so much
[59:27] that we're looking for an opportunity to
[59:29] be able to praise him and raise our
[59:31] hands and and adore him why because it's
[59:35] a love affair that's what he wants I
[59:37] found that many people have fallen in
[59:39] love with the message and many of them
[59:42] actually fell in love with brother
[59:43] brandham but I'll tell you I'm wondering
[59:45] how many of them fell in love with the
[59:47] Lord Jesus they really get excited about
[59:50] talking about doctrines in the message
[59:52] and they get so excited talking about
[59:55] this and that and the other I I've seen
[59:57] them get very exited talking about their
[59:59] certain favorite preacher but then you
[1:00:01] go to mention the Lord Jesus and they
[1:00:03] just kind of sit there and look at you
[1:00:04] you know the Lord Jesus so who's he it
[1:00:07] just so happens to be the creator of all
[1:00:10] this I think he ought to still excit us
[1:00:13] don't you because he took us when we
[1:00:16] were unlovable and transformed us and
[1:00:19] made us to where that we were lovable
[1:00:21] then after he did that he could not have
[1:00:24] a love relationship with us until we
[1:00:26] were transformed and made lovable now
[1:00:29] that we are made lovable he wants to
[1:00:31] have this spiritual relationship with us
[1:00:34] to where that he comes down not just
[1:00:37] twice a week three times a week when
[1:00:39] we're in church but every day of our
[1:00:42] life when you're driving down the road
[1:00:44] when you're taking your kids to school
[1:00:46] when you're coming back from school if
[1:00:47] you're at the grocery store he wants to
[1:00:50] have a love relationship with you so
[1:00:52] much that he can bring tears to your
[1:00:55] eyes and he can bring a song to your
[1:00:57] heart and just something about you to
[1:00:59] where that you have that that ultimate
[1:01:02] time with you and the Lord Jesus now he
[1:01:04] said to make love to you as a love
[1:01:07] affair not a law but a love again in the
[1:01:10] law having the shadow he says it's the
[1:01:12] spirit of Jesus Christ that makes me
[1:01:17] love the unlovable Now watch how brother
[1:01:19] Brandon describes about himself before
[1:01:23] this love came in him it makes me do
[1:01:27] things that I thought I never would do
[1:01:32] it makes me do things that I thought I
[1:01:36] never would do now you know what if it
[1:01:39] hasn't affected you the same way you
[1:01:41] need more of it
[1:01:42] today now how many wants a Revival how
[1:01:45] many wants a Revival in your heart in
[1:01:47] our church and you know we wish that we
[1:01:49] could say so on in the our nation we
[1:01:51] know that'll never be but I believe that
[1:01:53] we can have a Revival as an individual
[1:01:56] and also as our church whether or not
[1:01:58] our whole nation does the nation's
[1:01:59] finished as far as that but listen how
[1:02:02] he describes one of the greatest
[1:02:04] hindrances that keeps us from revival
[1:02:07] one of the greatest hindrance in the
[1:02:09] church today keeps a Revival back is the
[1:02:14] lack of that Godly love that Christ
[1:02:19] expressed when he was here on the earth
[1:02:22] now sure we could all pray more
[1:02:24] and we might could assemble more often
[1:02:26] and there's many things that we could do
[1:02:29] but why in the world would he choose
[1:02:32] love because what is a Revival a Revival
[1:02:35] is not adding more members to our church
[1:02:37] a Revival is just not how much we can
[1:02:39] jump and shout and surely we will do
[1:02:41] that but Revival is clean the trash out
[1:02:44] of us getting closer to God is that
[1:02:47] right and and falling more in love with
[1:02:50] him and this is the thing I found in my
[1:02:52] walk with the Lord that I cannot fall in
[1:02:55] love with him more without falling in
[1:02:57] love with his people more and wanting to
[1:02:59] be of Greater service I've live the
[1:03:02] majority of my life serving God's people
[1:03:06] started preaching when I was an
[1:03:07] 18-year-old boy and I have no regrets Oh
[1:03:11] Brother Don you gave your teens you gave
[1:03:12] your 20s your 30s your 40s your 50s the
[1:03:15] majority of my 60s to the service of God
[1:03:18] do you regret it only thing I regret is
[1:03:20] I wish I'd have done a better job and I
[1:03:22] wish I had more life you feel the same
[1:03:24] way so I found though that whenever I
[1:03:27] fall more in love with him that somehow
[1:03:30] it intensifies the love that I have for
[1:03:33] his people and I want to do what I can
[1:03:36] to help them even if they're not bride
[1:03:38] if I can help them just make life a
[1:03:41] little bit easier for a foolish virgin
[1:03:43] because the Lord Jesus don't just love
[1:03:45] the bride he loves the foolish virgin
[1:03:48] too he actually loves the lost and it's
[1:03:51] not his will that any should perish to
[1:03:54] me the more we fall in love with him the
[1:03:57] more we fall in love with the human race
[1:04:00] itself is that right now what's what he
[1:04:03] says here one of the greatest hindrance
[1:04:05] to the church today that keeps a Revival
[1:04:07] back is the lack of that Godly love that
[1:04:10] Christ expressed when he was on the
[1:04:11] earth it's easy for you and I to love
[1:04:15] somebody that loves us but Jesus didn't
[1:04:19] have that kind of love so the way we
[1:04:24] love Jesus didn't have that kind of love
[1:04:28] because our best friends and our best
[1:04:31] buddies and all of that are those
[1:04:33] naturally that agree with us now you
[1:04:35] don't have to say amen for the next few
[1:04:37] minutes if you don't want to it might
[1:04:38] help me a little bit if you did but we
[1:04:40] all can relate so much better to those
[1:04:43] that we really like and our our best
[1:04:46] friends and our best Pals and all that's
[1:04:49] the ones we just want to spend so much
[1:04:51] time with and tend to avoid the others
[1:04:53] and and arnest lovable but listen what
[1:04:56] he said Jesus didn't have that kind of
[1:04:58] love he had God's love and God loved his
[1:05:02] enemies for God so loved the world when
[1:05:05] the world was unlovable God still loved
[1:05:08] the world now if we're not careful we
[1:05:10] find that same way in among our our
[1:05:13] religious ranks that we tend to agree
[1:05:16] with folks and love them more that even
[1:05:18] doctrinally agree with us closer and
[1:05:22] that will be the ones that we tend to
[1:05:24] love the most but is that really the
[1:05:26] kind of love that Jesus had in reality
[1:05:30] there was no one in his stay upon the
[1:05:33] Earth the years that he was here even
[1:05:35] understood his Doctrine even the
[1:05:38] apostles they were so far away from him
[1:05:41] doctrinally they couldn't even
[1:05:44] understand the common simple terms I'm
[1:05:46] sure glad he didn't stop loving them
[1:05:49] because they didn't agree with him
[1:05:51] doctrinally now understand that we tend
[1:05:53] to Gra itate more toward those that
[1:05:56] believe like we do but is that real love
[1:05:59] when we do it that way now see already
[1:06:01] I'm going have to preach an amen myself
[1:06:02] too this morning now once again he says
[1:06:05] if you can just love those that love you
[1:06:08] why the Sinners do the same thing but
[1:06:11] we're different when Christ has come
[1:06:14] into our heart we love those those who
[1:06:16] do not love
[1:06:19] us how many can say you do that with all
[1:06:21] your heart sir how many can say you want
[1:06:24] to do that with all your heart amen me
[1:06:27] too now when Christ has come into our
[1:06:29] heart we love those who do not love us
[1:06:34] love the unlovable and we listen we were
[1:06:40] Len n the
[1:06:41] unlovable one time too and you know
[1:06:45] Christ loved us until we came to him now
[1:06:49] whenever it would come then to say
[1:06:52] doctrines and in between churches and
[1:06:54] doctrines and things in the message and
[1:06:56] Doctrine we must have a Doctrine to be a
[1:06:58] church churches that don't have
[1:07:00] doctrines don't even meet the
[1:07:02] requirement of being a church but how do
[1:07:05] we treat people them whenever we would
[1:07:08] find out say this church and this
[1:07:10] brother and that sister they don't
[1:07:12] exactly agree with us doctrinally how
[1:07:15] are we going to treat them are we going
[1:07:17] to treat them less favorably are we
[1:07:19] going to love them as much as we did
[1:07:23] before we found out they disagree with
[1:07:25] us in Doctrine are are we going to love
[1:07:28] them in spite of that and if we have
[1:07:31] more understanding than they do we're
[1:07:33] going to pray for them that God will
[1:07:35] help them to see what we see now you
[1:07:38] know this one thing I love about the
[1:07:40] message of the hour that it's not just
[1:07:42] quotes but our Prophet showed us how to
[1:07:46] live this message as well and really the
[1:07:50] message don't do us a whole lot of good
[1:07:52] if it's all up here and it don't come
[1:07:54] down here and help us to live a life
[1:07:57] that is like Jesus Christ right the
[1:08:00] devil is not scared of the of the the
[1:08:02] word as long as it lays in the written
[1:08:05] format in the Bible it's been laying
[1:08:07] there for years and years and years you
[1:08:10] could take your Bible lay it on that
[1:08:11] organ lay it on that lesle lay it on
[1:08:13] this pull pit lay it on that handrail
[1:08:16] come back a thousand years from today
[1:08:18] that handrail will not be changed one
[1:08:20] bit neither will this neither will the
[1:08:22] piano but we could ever get that word
[1:08:25] off of them pages into our hearts and
[1:08:28] let it Quicken our hearts it will change
[1:08:31] us day after day after day now let me
[1:08:35] give you just a little bit of an example
[1:08:37] here this morning of how the prophet
[1:08:39] that whenever he come now he knew that
[1:08:41] he was a restoration prophet and he knew
[1:08:43] that he was pointing the people back to
[1:08:45] the original Apostolic message so the
[1:08:49] mindset of the way the message is going
[1:08:51] to be brought is going to affect back
[1:08:54] future generations of how they perceive
[1:08:57] the message so it's important to him
[1:08:59] that he not only brings the doctrine and
[1:09:01] the restoration of the original
[1:09:03] Apostolic teachings but that he also
[1:09:06] shows us how do we deal with issues
[1:09:10] whenever we would have problems say in
[1:09:12] our church or how would we deal with
[1:09:14] issues when we have them in our home or
[1:09:16] how would we deal with them whenever we
[1:09:18] would have a difference of opinion among
[1:09:20] preachers now if you've got at least two
[1:09:23] preachers I can almost guarantee you
[1:09:25] you're going to have two opinions about
[1:09:28] just about anything you're going to talk
[1:09:29] about because every one of us have a
[1:09:32] different opinion and it's why we need
[1:09:35] an absolute and our absolute cannot just
[1:09:38] be you know well I believe and I think
[1:09:40] and I feel there must be something more
[1:09:43] than that and God gave us his word then
[1:09:46] God sent his his messengers of course
[1:09:48] and they would come and reflect that
[1:09:50] absolute light of the hour and it would
[1:09:53] give give us a direction in the way that
[1:09:56] we need to go and everybody said now
[1:09:58] remember we're talking about the right
[1:10:00] to perfect love I don't love I don't
[1:10:02] want to love the way everybody else out
[1:10:05] here loves I do not want to love the way
[1:10:07] the majority of Christians love I want
[1:10:11] to love in the Avenue of completion
[1:10:14] maturity fullness so if I go by the way
[1:10:18] of the grave and my heart is beating its
[1:10:20] Li beats and my breath is fixing to
[1:10:22] leave my body that I will know I am
[1:10:25] ready to meet the Lord Jesus I don't
[1:10:27] want to preach to you and wind up being
[1:10:30] lost myself I don't want to be able to
[1:10:32] quote the scripture and quote the
[1:10:34] message and wind up standing before God
[1:10:37] and him say to me depart from me you
[1:10:39] work of iniquity I never even knew you
[1:10:42] now I'm not going to be able to achieve
[1:10:44] that just by having signs and wonders
[1:10:46] and miracles and I've told you before
[1:10:48] I've had them all of my Ministry I
[1:10:50] started seeing miracles in my Ministry
[1:10:52] when I was a teen age preacher boy and
[1:10:55] they've continued to be there all of my
[1:10:57] life but I also know the Antichrist can
[1:11:01] produce the same signs we can but that
[1:11:04] same Prophet that I just quoted that to
[1:11:06] you said but the Antichrist cannot love
[1:11:11] so casting out Devils this that the
[1:11:13] other sure that that can be done but we
[1:11:15] want more than that is that
[1:11:18] right now watch's this brother brandham
[1:11:20] in his church and there was several
[1:11:22] Cycles in the Church of the brandham
[1:11:24] Tabernacle how that they went through in
[1:11:26] the gifts moving in the church there and
[1:11:29] uh in the early 50s they had it to where
[1:11:31] that they would Gather in a room and
[1:11:33] they would meet and then they would
[1:11:35] write down tongues interpretation and
[1:11:37] prophecy and all that and they write it
[1:11:39] out L on the platform and then someone
[1:11:41] would read it and then they come through
[1:11:43] another cycle in the Church of the
[1:11:45] brandham Tabernacle that brother branam
[1:11:48] had them up on the floor and allowed
[1:11:50] them to be on the floor and then he said
[1:11:53] to heavly said now just let it go for a
[1:11:56] while we can't judge it let it go for a
[1:11:59] while so they did and then whenever they
[1:12:02] set the cycle that it was to be in the
[1:12:05] way that he felt like it should be in
[1:12:08] church order 12
[1:12:10] 26263 then whenever he did some of the
[1:12:13] people pulled away from Brother
[1:12:14] brandom's church and they left his
[1:12:16] church and they went to Junior Jackson's
[1:12:19] Church JT Parnell Don R and some of
[1:12:22] those other brothers that were
[1:12:24] now I wonder the attitude that we would
[1:12:28] have had as Word of Life Church if we
[1:12:30] would have been a sister Church in that
[1:12:32] day and we would have heard about what
[1:12:34] happened that brother random did this
[1:12:36] and this is the way he felt like that it
[1:12:38] should be done and then some of those
[1:12:41] people pulled away and left and they
[1:12:43] went to some of the other churches I
[1:12:46] wonder what our attitude would have been
[1:12:48] well let me read to you what some of the
[1:12:51] attitude of the people in brand
[1:12:53] Tabernacle how they were thinking about
[1:12:56] some of these other people and the names
[1:12:59] that they were calling
[1:13:01] them now watch this question answer 64
[1:13:04] now also here I might bring this out I
[1:13:06] don't think my brother's here tonight
[1:13:08] but somebody made fun of somebody
[1:13:10] leaving the Tabernacle and went down to
[1:13:13] brother Junior Jackson's for church and
[1:13:16] they said they went down amongst the
[1:13:18] dead
[1:13:20] birds aren't you ashamed to make a Mark
[1:13:23] AR
[1:13:25] that come on now now wait a
[1:13:28] minute God's Prophet set that church in
[1:13:31] order the way he felt like it should be
[1:13:35] done and these people pulled away from
[1:13:40] that and so these people there were in
[1:13:43] defense of it and they said they're dead
[1:13:46] birds my they don't believe what brother
[1:13:49] R taught they're dead
[1:13:52] birds
[1:13:54] wow Welly if some of y'all know us going
[1:13:56] this way this morning You' prayed more
[1:13:57] wouldn't you before he come to
[1:14:01] church now I want you to notice how
[1:14:03] brother brandham reacts to this this
[1:14:06] reaction is very
[1:14:09] important if he reacts the wrong way he
[1:14:13] will influence thousands of preachers
[1:14:16] around the
[1:14:17] world he will affect thousands of lay
[1:14:21] people around the world for
[1:14:25] decades watch his
[1:14:28] reaction aren't you ashamed to make a
[1:14:31] remark like that ever who you are if
[1:14:35] you're my kid here in
[1:14:38] Christ I'm ashamed of
[1:14:41] you
[1:14:43] wow now
[1:14:46] doctrinally they were
[1:14:48] right but in their spirit and in their
[1:14:52] attitude
[1:14:53] yeah they were
[1:14:56] wrong now the people in my view that
[1:14:59] left and pulled away they were an
[1:15:03] error but you cannot correct an error in
[1:15:07] Doctrine by having an error in
[1:15:11] attitude so in order to correct error
[1:15:13] you've not only got to have the truths
[1:15:16] you've got to also have the right
[1:15:18] attitude now see what was missing with
[1:15:19] these people they had the truth and they
[1:15:21] could to say didn't you hear God Prophet
[1:15:23] say he told us if there's any question
[1:15:26] here let this tape be played and this is
[1:15:28] the bishop or the overseer he said and
[1:15:31] if there's any question let him come
[1:15:33] back to this tape they had the quotes
[1:15:35] and they had the word concerning because
[1:15:38] he said he was doing it exactly the way
[1:15:40] that Paul did it in the first
[1:15:42] church now it did amazing here that the
[1:15:45] message is in this stage in 1964 and
[1:15:49] already doctrines and and difference of
[1:15:51] opinions in the message churches are
[1:15:54] starting to raise up and there's a
[1:15:57] little bit of Separation now watch watch
[1:16:01] so instead of brother brandham joining
[1:16:03] on the bandwagon bandwagon of blasting
[1:16:06] Junior Jackson and those that left it
[1:16:09] would seem as if though he actually took
[1:16:12] sides with them and spanked his own
[1:16:18] youngans wow I mean he just flat wears
[1:16:22] them out why he picks up something about
[1:16:26] this attitude which is not Christlike
[1:16:30] amen you see what I'm saying friend we
[1:16:32] we want to be right doctrinally do we
[1:16:35] not how many wants to be right doctr
[1:16:37] sure we want to be right doctrin when it
[1:16:40] comes to election predestination all
[1:16:42] these wonderful things of God but I also
[1:16:45] want to be right if someone would
[1:16:48] disagree with me or you or with our
[1:16:51] church to where that we would be able to
[1:16:53] have not only the quotes of the message
[1:16:57] but the spirit the messenger
[1:17:00] had now let me just be honest with you
[1:17:03] it's easier for you to have one of his
[1:17:05] books or one of his tapes than it is for
[1:17:07] you to have the same Holy Ghost to him
[1:17:10] oh it's much easier to pick up a book oh
[1:17:12] I believe every word of it Hallelujah I
[1:17:15] believe every word of it well do you
[1:17:16] believe this word right here I just read
[1:17:18] to you this morning now you see God is
[1:17:21] dealing with this man and he slang the
[1:17:23] foundation he's only got about a year
[1:17:24] and a half left on the earth and it's so
[1:17:28] important that not only do we have the
[1:17:31] doctrines of the message but we have the
[1:17:33] spirit of the message and Paul told
[1:17:36] Timothy he said there is none other in
[1:17:39] the gospel that is as likeminded with me
[1:17:43] as you are and that word likeminded is
[1:17:46] of the Same Soul of the Same Soul so
[1:17:50] Timothy not only said what Paul Paul
[1:17:53] said but he looked at at Paul to see how
[1:17:56] how did he deal with confrontation how
[1:17:59] did he deal with when people would
[1:18:01] differ with him what kind of spirit did
[1:18:02] the man have and then Paul would give
[1:18:05] him what a compliment now there were all
[1:18:07] kinds of other preachers in that first
[1:18:09] century and yet Paul said about Timothy
[1:18:12] there's not a one of them that has the
[1:18:14] same soul that I have like you do so to
[1:18:18] me you look at that and you saying it
[1:18:20] must have been more than just quoting
[1:18:22] the doctrine and quoting the passages of
[1:18:24] scripture but there was something more
[1:18:27] about it he didn't say it was of the
[1:18:29] same Doctrine but of the Same Soul what
[1:18:31] is the soul nature of the spirit so in
[1:18:35] him he saw something about Paul and he
[1:18:38] would see maybe after he was beaten and
[1:18:41] after he was treated terribly and even
[1:18:43] the church the church at galatia had one
[1:18:46] time received him as an angel of God
[1:18:48] even as Christ Jesus then they begin to
[1:18:50] listen to some false teachers and they
[1:18:52] turned turned away from Paul the very
[1:18:54] man that led them to Christ and no doubt
[1:18:57] he watched him how does he deal with
[1:18:59] that opposition how did he how does he
[1:19:01] deal with people when they turn him down
[1:19:04] won't have a thing to do with him so
[1:19:06] what does he do does he just keep the
[1:19:08] same attitude bless God if you want to
[1:19:10] do me that way go on to hell you old
[1:19:12] serpent seed anyhow or does he keep on
[1:19:15] reaching out to him and loving them and
[1:19:17] really expressing Christ in another
[1:19:20] format I know I know I know I know I
[1:19:22] know I don't the great move right now
[1:19:24] the main thing is signs wonders and you
[1:19:26] know all of that but myself I desire to
[1:19:30] express the Lord Jesus and maybe
[1:19:33] attributes that aren't as loved as other
[1:19:35] people I want to be able to Love Like
[1:19:39] Jesus loved I want to be able to forgive
[1:19:42] like Jesus forgave I want to be able to
[1:19:45] love my enemies and pray for I want to
[1:19:48] be able to even love my friends and they
[1:19:50] don't seem to love me very much and I I
[1:19:52] want to be able to not hold a grudge
[1:19:55] against anybody in my heart come on
[1:19:58] somebody preach with me this morning I
[1:20:00] don't want to think of a sinner or
[1:20:02] anyone else in this world that I want
[1:20:05] them to be lost and if you think that
[1:20:07] way about somebody you need to hit this
[1:20:08] older whenever I make an aler call today
[1:20:11] I want to be able to be so much like him
[1:20:14] not only will I cast out devils and by
[1:20:17] his grace I do not only do I lay hands
[1:20:20] on cross eyes and them straightened out
[1:20:22] by his grace I have and we'll continue
[1:20:24] to do so and Cancers be healed and so on
[1:20:27] and so on if that's all I do then people
[1:20:31] in Matthew 24:24 can do the same thing
[1:20:34] but I want to forgive like Jesus I Want
[1:20:37] to Love Like Jesus I want to have so
[1:20:40] much mercy and compassion I ain't
[1:20:42] talking about compromising with sin I'm
[1:20:44] talking about being able to experience a
[1:20:47] love which cannot be impersonated by the
[1:20:51] devil amen
[1:21:00] now watch brother brandham he has the
[1:21:01] opportunity now if he
[1:21:04] wishes he's already mentioned Junior
[1:21:06] Jackson's name Don rutle JT
[1:21:09] Parnell all it takes is a couple of
[1:21:12] words brother Brenham ruin them yeah
[1:21:16] ruin
[1:21:18] them now is your opportunity ruin
[1:21:21] them but notice the way he handles it
[1:21:25] ever who you are if you're my kid in
[1:21:26] Christ I'm ashamed of you do a thing
[1:21:28] like that Junior Jackson is my brother
[1:21:32] Don rutle is my brother well the reason
[1:21:36] of it he said because I set the church
[1:21:38] here in a certain order come back to see
[1:21:40] if I could get the manifestation of the
[1:21:42] gifts half of them pulled away from it
[1:21:46] because when you start to speak or
[1:21:47] preach or something it was getting to
[1:21:49] such a place you could hardly preach L
[1:21:51] there was somebody spoken tongues
[1:21:53] somebody interpreting somebody giv the
[1:21:55] interpretation and half of it never even
[1:21:59] come to pass
[1:22:04] wow I thought it never even come to pass
[1:22:08] but now it's a pastor he let it go until
[1:22:11] it felt like it could be judged he said
[1:22:14] they were kids now it's come time to be
[1:22:16] judged in December of
[1:22:19] 63 now whenever he did it upset some of
[1:22:23] them now he said I believe in speaking
[1:22:25] in tongues and I believe in
[1:22:26] interpretation but it must be something
[1:22:28] directly to the church or something
[1:22:31] which is he said the Lord is coming soon
[1:22:34] which is all right don't use vain
[1:22:36] repution Jesus said so as the heathens
[1:22:39] do it must be something go tell brother
[1:22:43] so and so a certain thing he done to get
[1:22:45] this right why go tell brother sister so
[1:22:47] and so you done a certain thing down
[1:22:49] there the other day you transgressed the
[1:22:51] law of your husband the vow to your
[1:22:53] husband unless she makes that right the
[1:22:55] holy spirit will cut her
[1:22:58] off there you've got thus saith the Lord
[1:23:02] then bring that sin in that's when you
[1:23:05] got a church like ananas and Safara
[1:23:08] that's the gifts I want at our
[1:23:11] church I'm not looking for a repeat of
[1:23:14] what I saw in
[1:23:16] Pentecost how many of you all saw them
[1:23:19] types of gift in
[1:23:21] Pentecost now any of you that have
[1:23:23] raised your hands do you want to repeat
[1:23:27] no no sir
[1:23:31] why cuz it wasn't right was it hit Miss
[1:23:34] hit miss the Lord's coming I say the
[1:23:37] Lord's coming I'm here what is it
[1:23:39] repeating scripture which God's Prophet
[1:23:41] said that's not what it is so whenever
[1:23:45] the prophet said it in order then look
[1:23:47] what they done now he said then whenever
[1:23:50] we got a church like that ananas and
[1:23:52] Safar will return and remember it will
[1:23:54] come back we know that he says then we
[1:23:56] got a church that stands solid I believe
[1:23:58] the tongues and people that's got them
[1:24:00] gifts if they're real genuine Christians
[1:24:02] and interested in it they'll meet
[1:24:04] themselves together because give the
[1:24:06] tongues an interpretation see what they
[1:24:08] can do to further the kingdom of God
[1:24:10] they've got a Ministry on their
[1:24:13] own but it don't belong here in the
[1:24:15] middle of the
[1:24:20] audience where the Sinners are being
[1:24:22] dealt with and so
[1:24:25] forth but of course some of those other
[1:24:28] people didn't believe that they didn't
[1:24:30] go along with it so whenever brother
[1:24:33] Rand said it in order they said I'm
[1:24:38] leaving he ain't preaching what I
[1:24:40] believe oh my on now can you imagine
[1:24:44] anybody walking away from the prophet of
[1:24:45] God's
[1:24:47] church I can really because they walk
[1:24:50] away from his teaching in our church or
[1:24:51] whoever else Church it is because it's
[1:24:54] his body don't make no difference either
[1:24:55] you believe what he said or you don't
[1:24:57] believe what he said just the bottom
[1:24:59] line but now notice now his
[1:25:04] reaction and he
[1:25:06] said they say you're unlearned and
[1:25:09] sometimes they got so irreverent with it
[1:25:11] not our gang huh what a word to call
[1:25:14] them now our gang hadn't but I let him
[1:25:18] go ahead for a while and I said watch it
[1:25:20] now I told the Brethren there's
[1:25:21] Witnesses here that know this I said let
[1:25:23] it alone and we'll find out whether it's
[1:25:26] God or not if it cannot stand
[1:25:28] chastisement then it's a bastard child
[1:25:32] exactly what the Bible said so when the
[1:25:34] chastisement come what happened I want
[1:25:37] you to notice now the way that he's
[1:25:38] dealing with this he's not compromising
[1:25:40] and say well you know really I I
[1:25:42] probably shouldn't have said that I I I
[1:25:45] didn't know I was going to make people
[1:25:46] mad and I I I really shouldn't have said
[1:25:48] that and I'm so sorry so I'm going to
[1:25:50] retract what I said so all of those of
[1:25:53] of you that left us yall just come back
[1:25:56] and and I'm I'm I'm sorry I apologize no
[1:25:59] you're talking about
[1:26:01] Elijah I said you're talking about
[1:26:03] Elijah so he's still standing firm on
[1:26:07] what he
[1:26:08] believes but Harry has a different
[1:26:10] attitude right you see there's such a
[1:26:14] delicate balance in us being able to
[1:26:16] stand firm unmovable absolutely
[1:26:20] unmovable and not being mean about it
[1:26:23] and not being harsh and not being
[1:26:25] grouchy and hateful oh my Lord praise
[1:26:30] God now you told me you wanted love do
[1:26:33] we are not well see here is Love on
[1:26:36] display in a way when people are totally
[1:26:40] disagreeing with
[1:26:43] you
[1:26:44] myama now watch he said did not I tell
[1:26:48] that tell you that long ago he's
[1:26:50] speaking to brother brother Neville
[1:26:51] asked to Pastor here he said what about
[1:26:53] this and that I said let it alone
[1:26:57] they're
[1:26:59] babies we can't judge it but watch when
[1:27:04] it really comes to pin it down to the
[1:27:06] word now brother Jor Jackson had a right
[1:27:10] to disagree with
[1:27:16] that
[1:27:18] now I have a right to disagree with it
[1:27:21] too
[1:27:22] but I forfeit my
[1:27:27] right because I trust him more than I
[1:27:31] trust
[1:27:33] myself and to be honest I trust him more
[1:27:36] than I trust any of
[1:27:39] you praise the
[1:27:42] Lord now notice his attitude see through
[1:27:44] the whole thing now remember he can ruin
[1:27:46] these guys if he would have said a few
[1:27:49] words that would have seemed to chross
[1:27:51] in negative way who would have had any
[1:27:54] confidence in
[1:27:55] them oh my junior Jackson had a right to
[1:27:59] disagree with that he wants his church
[1:28:01] the people all want to speak with
[1:28:03] tongues and things in the audience
[1:28:05] that's brother
[1:28:10] Junior's
[1:28:12] a not brother Junior's blessings not
[1:28:16] brother Junior's great manifestations
[1:28:18] from god notice he's not compromising
[1:28:20] now what he believes he's Iden ifying
[1:28:22] what this will do it will bring troubles
[1:28:26] troubles and more
[1:28:29] troubles but if that's what brother
[1:28:31] Junior Jackson wants he said then people
[1:28:34] speaking in tongues and things in the
[1:28:36] audience that brother Junior Jackson's
[1:28:37] Troubles that's up to him but now how
[1:28:40] many of us could say this next line
[1:28:43] let's say what he
[1:28:46] said Junior Jackson believes this
[1:28:49] message the same as any of the rest of
[1:28:52] us
[1:28:54] does
[1:28:56] sir now why did some of y'all just pull
[1:28:59] your toes up in your shoe like that
[1:29:01] whenever I read that don't you see we
[1:29:05] need
[1:29:10] help because what do we want to do cut
[1:29:13] people
[1:29:16] off bless God they don't believe what
[1:29:18] the prophet of God said it's just plain
[1:29:20] and simple we not going to no
[1:29:23] Rapture and when did God give you the
[1:29:26] glasses to go to looking down in
[1:29:28] people's soul and tell who's bride and
[1:29:30] who
[1:29:33] ain't praise the Lord now I wonder what
[1:29:36] some of you had done if you've been
[1:29:37] going to the brandham tabernacle during
[1:29:40] these several span of years that brother
[1:29:42] brandham was allowing these babies to
[1:29:45] operate their
[1:29:46] gifts one mistake after another after
[1:29:50] another wonder if you don't want to
[1:29:51] brother Brandon said brother Brandon
[1:29:53] when you going to set them people down
[1:29:54] when you going to set this thing down
[1:29:56] when you going to do this that and other
[1:29:57] and he when brother Neville even come to
[1:29:59] him asking of course for advice and
[1:30:01] counsel what did the prophet tell him
[1:30:02] leave it alone they're
[1:30:07] babies oh my
[1:30:10] goodness so what if when you started
[1:30:12] talking as a child and
[1:30:18] [Music]
[1:30:20] you and your mama said shut that
[1:30:24] up until you can speak eloquent English
[1:30:28] don't open your mouth
[1:30:32] again on
[1:30:36] now sir so we had to learn didn't we I
[1:30:39] don't know about you I'm still learning
[1:30:40] to speak good English
[1:30:43] myself but we spit and we slobbered and
[1:30:46] you know Mama and Daddy's vying over
[1:30:48] which one you going to say first mama or
[1:30:50] daddy of course and then then it'll be
[1:30:52] you know Papa or Noo-noo or whatever it
[1:30:54] is oh said M first s man first
[1:30:58] Hallelujah so the prophet gave him that
[1:31:00] time so if you would have been in the
[1:31:02] message and you would have been going to
[1:31:04] that church and you would have said Lord
[1:31:06] have
[1:31:07] mercy this is what they' done at the
[1:31:09] Pentecostal church I come out
[1:31:12] of I can't believe brother R was letting
[1:31:15] this go on I'm leaving I'm out of
[1:31:20] here
[1:31:24] love
[1:31:27] love
[1:31:30] love but when you going to preach on
[1:31:32] something else when we get
[1:31:34] this when we get this let's let's get
[1:31:37] this and then we can move on into the
[1:31:39] gifts perfect love the prophet said will
[1:31:42] produce perfect gifts maybe we should
[1:31:45] preach that first amen maybe we should
[1:31:47] get that baptism of Love first then
[1:31:50] we'll really know what gifts are
[1:31:52] supposed to do they're not to gratify us
[1:31:55] they're for Ed edification of the
[1:32:00] body now watch as he goes on and he said
[1:32:04] Junior Jackson believes this message the
[1:32:07] same as in the rest of us as it's not a
[1:32:09] dead bird to go there Junior Jackson is
[1:32:12] a man of
[1:32:17] God that I love was all of my heart
[1:32:23] W but brother randam he didn't he didn't
[1:32:26] set his church up well you do
[1:32:28] yours and it amazing that brother Bram
[1:32:31] didn't say up till about a few months
[1:32:32] ago and then after a few months ago I'm
[1:32:35] sorry I cannot love him with all of our
[1:32:36] heart but he still loved him with all of
[1:32:39] his heart and what's amazing is he goes
[1:32:41] on for another year and a half or so
[1:32:42] he's still there in the meetings he's
[1:32:44] still a part of the move of of the
[1:32:46] message of the hour brother R was still
[1:32:48] referring to him still talking about him
[1:32:51] he don't shun him he don't slide him why
[1:32:54] our messenger had what he preached amen
[1:32:58] I think it's time that we as his
[1:33:00] followers supposedly get what we've been
[1:33:03] talking about for decades more of the
[1:33:07] love of God in our hearts what Good's it
[1:33:11] going to do for us to talk about the
[1:33:13] Rapture what Good's it going to do for
[1:33:15] us to sing songs about it and sing about
[1:33:18] going to heaven and miss the very Avenue
[1:33:20] of divine love love that'll put us in
[1:33:23] there can I have a few more minutes of
[1:33:26] your
[1:33:27] time notice this he refers to it in
[1:33:29] perfect love and he also calls it Divine
[1:33:31] love now he said what the church is
[1:33:34] lacking is divine love I don't mean
[1:33:37] affectionate love for one another I mean
[1:33:39] the agapo Love The Godly love and have
[1:33:42] it so richly in your heart until you
[1:33:46] just love the Lord and what's the
[1:33:48] connection and everything and you take
[1:33:51] his word for it and you don't mistrust
[1:33:54] it you see it's always Pro evident that
[1:33:57] I've seen it through the years whenever
[1:33:59] people don't have the right trust for
[1:34:02] God and whenever things will happen to
[1:34:04] them that they don't understand and they
[1:34:07] go to questioning God's wisdom and God's
[1:34:09] choice and this and that and I've always
[1:34:11] noticed that excuse me there tends to be
[1:34:15] a lack of love because love produces
[1:34:20] more Trust
[1:34:22] the more you love him the more you can
[1:34:25] trust him but if you don't love him
[1:34:28] right then when he does something that
[1:34:30] you do not understand then you well how
[1:34:33] how come you do that why did you do that
[1:34:35] I don't understand why you do that but
[1:34:37] if you love him and love him and love
[1:34:39] him and even if he breaks your heart you
[1:34:44] trust
[1:34:46] him because you love him now we said we
[1:34:50] love thee with unchangeable love 25
[1:34:53] years ago you place that Divine love in
[1:34:56] my heart for the Lord Jesus and it grows
[1:34:58] sweeter every day I'm so happy notice
[1:35:01] now how he relates this about love that
[1:35:04] we grow in the Lord till we become in
[1:35:08] the full stature the measure or the
[1:35:11] stature of Christ did we get it all once
[1:35:13] we got the Holy Ghost we did not I don't
[1:35:15] know about you I'm still growing today
[1:35:18] in knowledge and understanding hopefully
[1:35:20] in wisdom and all of that but I don't
[1:35:22] want to stop growing in love I want to
[1:35:24] be able to grow in love more and more
[1:35:27] and more if going beyond the curtain of
[1:35:29] time changed the prophet's life forever
[1:35:31] and he said everything that you ever
[1:35:33] preached this is what it was the Holy
[1:35:36] Ghost This is Love and thus sayith the
[1:35:39] Lord lay aside everything until you get
[1:35:43] Divine love perfect love and the church
[1:35:47] said you say I love him come on down but
[1:35:51] can you trust him when the doctor shakes
[1:35:53] his head can you trust him when
[1:35:56] everything has gone wrong you need an
[1:35:59] overflowing
[1:36:01] baptism of love divine love but is it
[1:36:05] amazing though when we think about
[1:36:06] baptism we think about more emotional
[1:36:09] ecstatic joy and all that oh I I I think
[1:36:12] probably the majority of our people
[1:36:14] sitting here today need another baptism
[1:36:18] of love and what you'll find is you'll
[1:36:21] finds yourself falling in love with your
[1:36:23] wife and your husband and your kids
[1:36:25] maybe even your pastor too maybe even
[1:36:28] the deacons maybe even somebody that
[1:36:30] crosses you a little bit or your boss on
[1:36:32] the job tomorrow and you walk in there
[1:36:34] after that baptism of love and you think
[1:36:37] man that guy is so grouchy but you'll
[1:36:39] walk in there feeling different toward
[1:36:41] him in your heart and then you realize
[1:36:43] it wasn't just him that needed help it
[1:36:46] was actually
[1:36:48] you oh my everybody hang with me now or
[1:36:54] heading for some
[1:36:57] turbulence if I had every gift in the
[1:37:01] Bible and could exchange it yes sir for
[1:37:06] love I'd never wink an
[1:37:10] eye I'd take
[1:37:12] it right
[1:37:15] now and remember he's not doing away
[1:37:17] with
[1:37:18] gifts but he showing us the value
[1:37:22] Prophet Paul said that whenever people
[1:37:25] speak in tongues that's a wonderful
[1:37:26] thing but he said actually it's greater
[1:37:29] if they prophesy so even among the gifts
[1:37:32] there are some that are greater than
[1:37:34] others and this is actually greater than
[1:37:38] any of
[1:37:39] them I find it so amazing though in our
[1:37:42] days especially in the ranks of the
[1:37:43] message that the gifts that are being so
[1:37:45] emphasized there's really only
[1:37:48] three tongues interpretation and
[1:37:50] prophecy
[1:37:52] so when the prophet is talking about
[1:37:54] gifts and the quotes does that include
[1:37:56] the other six come on on Amen don't
[1:38:00] raise your hand but I wonder how many of
[1:38:01] you can name all nine today I wonder how
[1:38:04] many of our preachers can name all
[1:38:07] nine or did they just focus on
[1:38:13] three oh I'm I'm sorry I must have said
[1:38:15] something
[1:38:16] wrong makes you wonder don't
[1:38:19] it so you see God has an order a way
[1:38:24] what if he could fill every individual
[1:38:26] here in our
[1:38:28] church with such love of God and we
[1:38:32] wonder what's God waiting on what's God
[1:38:33] waiting on oh we're looking for a great
[1:38:35] hour we're looking for the missing limbs
[1:38:36] to be restored we're looking for ananas
[1:38:38] and saf fire wonder what what's God
[1:38:40] waiting on and if we're not careful
[1:38:42] we're going to get in the big tizzy and
[1:38:44] we're going to try to work up something
[1:38:45] with the music or work up something with
[1:38:47] this or that and we're going to run
[1:38:49] right ahead of the whole program of
[1:38:54] God with an armload of
[1:38:57] substitutes that's all right cuz we
[1:39:00] didn't get love first I ain't talking
[1:39:03] about just the degree of love we have
[1:39:04] now I'm talking about Divine love with
[1:39:07] such a degree someone could take a gun
[1:39:10] out and stick it to your
[1:39:14] head and you would pray for
[1:39:18] them they could lie on you on face book
[1:39:21] they could run you down and instead of
[1:39:23] your flesh picking up your keyboard
[1:39:26] uhhuh I'll get you back I'll tell this
[1:39:29] I'll tell that you get down on your
[1:39:32] knees and pray God forgive
[1:39:36] them you talking about having some
[1:39:40] gifts praise the Lord amen notice now he
[1:39:44] goes on to say Let Me Feel the blessings
[1:39:47] of the Lord Jesus and his Divine love in
[1:39:49] my heart that's shed abroad by the Holy
[1:39:51] Ghost and I'll exchange any gift in the
[1:39:56] Bible for
[1:39:59] that wow oh you say I've spoken tongues
[1:40:03] I don't have nothing to do with it I've
[1:40:04] shouted still don't have nothing to do
[1:40:06] with it Paul said I could speak in
[1:40:08] tongues like men and angels and still be
[1:40:12] lost I could have faith to move
[1:40:14] mountains still be lost that ain't it if
[1:40:17] the Divine love of God isn't in your
[1:40:20] heart to take everything of the world
[1:40:22] out you're
[1:40:26] lost and the devil is
[1:40:29] only deceiving
[1:40:34] you that's just one of the things that I
[1:40:37] saw whenever I was in Pentecost as a
[1:40:38] Pentecostal
[1:40:40] preacher that people could speak in
[1:40:42] tongues and prophesy remember brother
[1:40:43] Brand's introduction the first time he
[1:40:46] saw the gifts in operation Muke Indiana
[1:40:49] and there was two main men he said boy
[1:40:51] if I can get around them I was just a
[1:40:53] hunger and he said to be around them and
[1:40:55] one of them would speak in tongues and
[1:40:56] the other and interpret he said
[1:40:58] everything that I knew it just testified
[1:41:00] to the spirit that I had and he said I
[1:41:02] got around them and he said pulled over
[1:41:04] into that little gear he said them gifts
[1:41:06] and calling of God without repentance
[1:41:07] and he said that one man was a genuine
[1:41:11] Christian that other one was married to
[1:41:13] what was it a blackhead woman and had a
[1:41:16] had a child by a blond-headed woman am
[1:41:20] both of them the same spirit of
[1:41:25] God and that's what we want
[1:41:37] back let's get so
[1:41:40] full of his
[1:41:44] love that not a day goes
[1:41:46] by that we don't pray for the
[1:41:49] Lost for a family there's probably not a
[1:41:53] person in here tonight that don't have a
[1:41:54] friend a family that's lost do we call
[1:41:57] their name every day we've got children
[1:41:59] we' got grandchildren without the
[1:42:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost and we're more
[1:42:02] concerned about Facebook we're more
[1:42:04] concerned about this and that and the
[1:42:05] other than we our lost friends we're in
[1:42:07] the end time I know you've heard this
[1:42:08] for years and years we're at the end
[1:42:11] time at any moment our lord Jesus could
[1:42:14] come and if he come where would your
[1:42:16] children be lost on where would some of
[1:42:20] our message kids sitting in church and
[1:42:22] some of them you know oh they come to
[1:42:23] church and they sing and do this and
[1:42:25] that and they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:42:27] you don't go without it young people
[1:42:31] it's not enough to say well I'm the use
[1:42:33] of a Word of Life I'm the use of evening
[1:42:35] light you've got to be a holy ghost
[1:42:38] filled
[1:42:39] Christian but my mama is a good person
[1:42:42] that's not what will put you in you've
[1:42:45] got to have the
[1:42:47] [Applause]
[1:42:49] token
[1:42:54] oh
[1:42:57] my again he said where there's tongues
[1:42:59] they shall cease where there's
[1:43:01] prophecies they'll fail the Antichrist
[1:43:03] can produce any
[1:43:06] sign that's in the
[1:43:12] Bible but he cannot
[1:43:15] love there's nothing about
[1:43:19] him to
[1:43:25] love agapo love is divine love and when
[1:43:28] Divine love is in your heart there's a
[1:43:29] difference in your
[1:43:32] life and everybody knows
[1:43:34] it that's right you live like a
[1:43:37] Christian act like a Christian walk like

[1:45:42] and you're
[1:45:45] transform you've got this Grecian
[1:45:48] profile you've got these dazzling
[1:45:52] eyes forget
[1:45:55] it and yet we can be
[1:45:59] bathed in the beauty of his
[1:46:02] Holiness amen and we ain't even got time
[1:46:04] to stay around after the preacher's done
[1:46:06] my goodness some of y'all can't even sit
[1:46:07] still five minutes after I say let's
[1:46:09] stand you're gone where y'all going in
[1:46:11] such a
[1:46:13] hurry yes sir that's when we want to
[1:46:16] worship he said now it's time to be
[1:46:19] bathed down in the presence of God and
[1:46:26] worship now listen what he says after
[1:46:29] they were bathed in this beauty of God's
[1:46:33] righteousness I was just inspired to
[1:46:36] speak them words and
[1:46:38] say some glorious day all the gifts
[1:46:42] that's in the church will be set aside
[1:46:44] on the mantle as it was the Holy Spirit
[1:46:48] himself will just take the church search
[1:46:50] in such control of divine love now I
[1:46:53] want you to notice now once the Holy
[1:46:55] Spirit does that it ain't that there
[1:46:57] ain't no more healing and there ain't no
[1:46:59] more miracles and there ain't no more
[1:47:02] Supernatural listen what is going to
[1:47:03] happen the holy spirit will just take
[1:47:05] the church in such a control of divine
[1:47:08] love until the sick will be healed the
[1:47:11] blind will see the lame will walk
[1:47:16] without hands being laid on them it'll
[1:47:19] just be one great Unity Miracles ain't
[1:47:23] going to stop the more love we get signs
[1:47:26] ain't going to stop the more love we get
[1:47:29] but it'll transfer from man getting the
[1:47:31] glory to God getting all the
[1:47:34] glory I tell all if that what we
[1:47:38] want I don't deserve no glory no other
[1:47:41] preacher deserves
[1:47:45] Glory he's the one that deserves
[1:47:48] it mist
[1:47:54] let me read this and as you stand to
[1:47:55] your feet oh if the Pentecostal Church
[1:47:56] would only satisfy thirst in God instead
[1:47:59] of trying to follow some evangelist or
[1:48:02] some emotion or some little ISM or
[1:48:05] little sensation how much better El it
[1:48:08] be you'd follow the holy spirit in
[1:48:10] Divine
[1:48:13] love instead of Sensations and little
[1:48:17] gifts and things like that how much
[1:48:19] better off you'd be
[1:48:21] God don't want
[1:48:24] you to run after
[1:48:28] gifts God wants
[1:48:31] you to
[1:48:33] thirst after
[1:48:38] him well you know what get the giver you
[1:48:42] get all of his gifts in the
[1:48:44] package and if you're a real believer
[1:48:47] you want
[1:48:49] them I mentioned to you the other night
[1:48:51] I think it maybe to the
[1:48:53] youth I've been around so-called gifts
[1:48:56] most of my
[1:48:58] life I'm not sure how many I've ever
[1:49:01] seen really that were really
[1:49:05] real a few I've heard a few
[1:49:08] manifestations and it would line up but
[1:49:10] it would be hit Miss hit
[1:49:14] Miss right B Jim right some of you that
[1:49:18] saw
[1:49:19] it
[1:49:22] why would I ever want to go back to
[1:49:26] that so in Carol and I was in a tent
[1:49:29] meeting one
[1:49:30] night and a preacher calls her out and
[1:49:34] tells her
[1:49:36] sister you're called to
[1:49:43] preach I agree with him because she had
[1:49:46] two people in her congregation Lish and
[1:49:49] Erica
[1:49:50] sometimes they didn't either one them
[1:49:51] listen but she preach
[1:49:58] anyhow yeah can you imagine a preacher
[1:50:02] standing up supposedly under the holy
[1:50:05] ghost telling a woman she's called to
[1:50:07] preach that's contrary to God's
[1:50:12] word but you see when you have nothing
[1:50:14] to judge it by nothing to measure it up
[1:50:17] it's just free
[1:50:19] course
[1:50:20] then in comes one demon after
[1:50:24] another after
[1:50:30] another I would love
[1:50:32] it if the spirit of God would fall Among
[1:50:35] Us with genuine
[1:50:37] gifts and somebody come in here and sat
[1:50:40] down and their life wasn't right with
[1:50:42] God and we say it this way after the
[1:50:45] gifts were
[1:50:46] matured tongues interpreters and so on
[1:50:49] would meet in a room provided and they
[1:50:51] would write down on a letter or a
[1:50:55] note give it to Brother Louie or to me
[1:50:58] and I'd come out and
[1:50:59] say the gifted people met prior to
[1:51:03] service thus saith the Lord yeah tell
[1:51:08] brother so and so he did this against
[1:51:10] his wife if he don't make it right
[1:51:13] within three days he'll
[1:51:16] die I guarantee you one thing if that
[1:51:18] moved in Among Us
[1:51:20] we'd be a better
[1:51:24] Church come on
[1:51:29] somebody people are scared to death to
[1:51:31] get around a man that they think's got
[1:51:33] discernment that shows me there's
[1:51:35] something wrong with their
[1:51:36] life don't you understand when brother
[1:51:38] Bram said discernment absolutely wore
[1:51:41] him out he said but God has given me
[1:51:43] some help at the
[1:51:45] Tabernacle you know what that help was
[1:51:48] tongues and
[1:51:51] interpretation that's what he said I'm
[1:51:53] not adding that that's what he said
[1:51:55] tongues and interpretation why because
[1:51:57] tongues and interpretation rightly done
[1:52:00] is prophecy
[1:52:04] right you imagine God giving brother
[1:52:06] brandham this
[1:52:08] help what was it it was the spirit of
[1:52:11] God
[1:52:13] Discerning isn't one wasn't I'm the Lord
[1:52:15] I'm here and I'm here to help and I'm
[1:52:17] here to bless and I'm here to do this
[1:52:19] that's not what it was it was you need
[1:52:23] to fix this in your life you need to
[1:52:25] take care of this I saw you day before
[1:52:27] yesterday on your face crying and
[1:52:29] praying before God and you said this and
[1:52:31] this and this and God's going to answer
[1:52:33] your petition if it don't come to pass
[1:52:35] it's
[1:52:38] false wow I guarantee one thing when we
[1:52:40] started come to church y'all might not
[1:52:42] stand up turn and talk as much for
[1:52:44] church you might be in here oh Jesus if
[1:52:46] there's anything in my life take it out
[1:52:48] Lord Lord forgive me for what I said oh
[1:52:51] God forgive me man you talking about
[1:52:52] having some meetings woo we' have some
[1:52:56] meetings around you wouldn't
[1:53:05] we let's pray
[1:53:10] together Lord Jesus I stand before you
[1:53:14] today
[1:53:15] knowing that I will give an account of
[1:53:17] this sermon one day
[1:53:21] so I don't want to approach you Lord as
[1:53:24] The Shepherd of the sheep
[1:53:26] first as the leader of the flock I want
[1:53:29] to approach you
[1:53:30] first as an
[1:53:33] individual me standing before you alone
[1:53:37] by myself first in
[1:53:39] prayer and I tell you today
[1:53:42] sir I need more I want more I must have
[1:53:48] more of your life
[1:53:52] love help me
[1:53:56] Jesus help me to love more like
[1:54:00] you help me to
[1:54:03] forgive I read it to him a few weeks ago
[1:54:05] where the Roman
[1:54:07] historians and those of capedan and the
[1:54:10] different ones took note of it and wrote
[1:54:13] it in their historical writings they
[1:54:14] were not even Christians
[1:54:16] but it was over and over again how they
[1:54:19] talked about the
[1:54:21] Christians and how they
[1:54:24] loved and one of them says their Master
[1:54:28] tells them they are
[1:54:32] brothers and of course they believed
[1:54:35] him and I found it so amazing when I was
[1:54:37] studying on that from a historical
[1:54:39] standpoint that the historians wasn't
[1:54:42] writing about them just casting out
[1:54:44] devils and Healing The Sick and and
[1:54:46] raising the dead they heard about
[1:54:48] that but it wasn't that so much that
[1:54:52] made the historical record as it was how
[1:54:55] they loved one another and how they
[1:54:58] loved
[1:54:59] you and they loved you so much they were
[1:55:02] willing to go to the
[1:55:06] Coliseum sisters would have their bab
[1:55:08] their bellies ripped open and their
[1:55:11] babies jerked
[1:55:13] out and its little brains dashed against
[1:55:16] a stone
[1:55:17] wall because they loved
[1:55:23] you brothers would give their lives
[1:55:25] sisters would give their
[1:55:28] lives for you and your
[1:55:31] cause because of
[1:55:34] Love help us Lord
[1:55:38] Jesus oh Father God I'm asking you
[1:55:42] now not just for me but for these people
[1:55:45] I know we have some visors here in our
[1:55:46] gates
[1:55:47] today but I pray Lord Lord that should
[1:55:50] help each of us and those that will
[1:55:52] stream the service and archive it
[1:55:54] later may we search our
[1:55:58] hearts Lord God I know that it's beyond
[1:56:02] me I I can't love this
[1:56:05] way I just have to be honest with you I
[1:56:08] can't do it and I'll be honest for them
[1:56:11] they can't
[1:56:13] either we can only love this way if you
[1:56:17] baptize Us in such a baptism of life
[1:56:21] love then Lord if we can get that kind
[1:56:24] of love and that will be our
[1:56:27] foundation then if you choose to let
[1:56:29] gifts come among
[1:56:32] us then there won't have to be worry
[1:56:34] about no selfishness involved in them
[1:56:37] gifts if they would just read 1
[1:56:40] Corinthians
[1:56:42] 13 the way Paul's setting it in order
[1:56:44] about tongues interpretation prophecy
[1:56:46] the whole thing if they would read it
[1:56:48] with the right mind mindset even chapter
[1:56:50] 11 and 12 leading up to 13 they would
[1:56:53] realize he's trying to stri strike down
[1:56:57] the
[1:56:58] selfishness that is in the Corinthian
[1:57:02] Church so they were measuring
[1:57:04] everybody's experience by their own well
[1:57:07] you got to speak in tongues cuz I did
[1:57:08] you got to shout cuz I did you got to do
[1:57:10] this Paul said does all speak in tongues
[1:57:13] do all
[1:57:14] prophesy so they're taking their
[1:57:16] spiritual gifts and using it as an
[1:57:19] element of
[1:57:20] arrogance and measuring other people in
[1:57:23] their own church by them you don't
[1:57:25] scream the way I do you don't shout the
[1:57:27] way I do so you're not as close to God
[1:57:30] as I
[1:57:31] am Paul was trying to help them receive
[1:57:33] spiritual gifts are for the edification
[1:57:37] of the body that's why I told a person
[1:57:39] that would speak in tongues if there's
[1:57:40] no interpreter they are to keep silent
[1:57:43] in the church because speaking in
[1:57:46] tongues is edifying themsel but it just
[1:57:49] just so happens they're not the only one
[1:57:50] in church
[1:57:52] today this is the whole picture oh Jesus
[1:57:57] may you Circle The Globe father with the
[1:58:00] refilling of the Holy
[1:58:05] Ghost dear God
[1:58:07] I I really get concerned about where we
[1:58:11] are I know sometimes sheep don't know it
[1:58:13] and they don't understand it but our
[1:58:16] message has been on a brink of silver
[1:58:19] war
[1:58:20] many
[1:58:23] times and we're on the brink of
[1:58:26] another help us
[1:58:29] Jesus help every preacher
[1:58:33] Lord not to use their
[1:58:36] influence to incite a war against their
[1:58:40] own
[1:58:42] Brothers your Prophet could have started
[1:58:45] a civil war right there in
[1:58:47] Indiana but instead
[1:58:49] said he took the higher
[1:58:53] Road I thank you for this question
[1:58:56] answers Lord I Thank you for a man of
[1:58:59] God before us that we can follow his
[1:59:05] example praise
[1:59:07] God make me more like you
[1:59:10] Jesus how many here today would just
[1:59:12] raise your hands and say Lord I want to
[1:59:15] be more like
[1:59:17] you would you be honest and say I need
[1:59:20] more
[1:59:21] love I need more of love for the Lord
[1:59:25] Jesus love for my brothers and sisters
[1:59:28] more tolerance for their
[1:59:30] mistakes more tolerance for people that
[1:59:34] I may think don't
[1:59:36] exactly go along with what brother
[1:59:38] Brenham
[1:59:40] said come on
[1:59:43] somebody what will it make us do it'll
[1:59:46] make us pray for him instead of judging
[1:59:48] them nobody pointed us as the judge
[1:59:51] anyway it'll make us pray for him and
[1:59:54] try to reach out to him and maybe
[1:59:57] understand what caused them to lean that
[2:00:01] way praise God would you do me a favor
[2:00:03] now of course there's so many of you
[2:00:05] here today there's no way I can go
[2:00:07] amongst you but would you take your hand
[2:00:10] and just let over on the brother
[2:00:12] sister standing by
[2:00:15] you and we're not going to pray for
[2:00:18] gifts now I'm not against that Paul told
[2:00:20] us to earnestly desire the best gifts
[2:00:23] but he said rather to
[2:00:25] prophesy but the prophet told us don't
[2:00:28] seek gifts you can understand when you
[2:00:30] take this terminology it's for selfish
[2:00:34] means seeking it like you would weals
[2:00:37] seeking it like you would
[2:00:39] position we just simply open ourself he
[2:00:42] said the gift of Prophecy might fall up
[2:00:44] on a person today and never fall on them
[2:00:47] again speaking in Tong Tong
[2:00:49] interpretation of tongues may fall on a
[2:00:50] person and it may never hit them in
[2:00:52] their life but if you can get Divine
[2:00:55] love it'll be yours forever don't you
[2:00:58] see what divine love is friends it's a
[2:01:01] little bit of
[2:01:03] foretaste of what we're fixing to enter
[2:01:05] into in
[2:01:06] heaven there won't be nobody speaking in
[2:01:09] tongues in heaven interpreting all that
[2:01:11] those gifts are given to us in time for
[2:01:14] correction but perfect love is the world
[2:01:18] we will live live in
[2:01:22] Forever Lord Jesus as we have our hands
[2:01:24] laid upon
[2:01:27] another Lord I remember reading in the
[2:01:30] Bible where the apostles were filled
[2:01:31] with the Holy Ghost on the day of
[2:01:33] Pentecost and then after they went go
[2:01:35] through a great trial and a great
[2:01:37] hardship the Bible says they were
[2:01:39] gathered together again and the spirit
[2:01:41] of God came again and fill them so they
[2:01:45] had already been baptized in the Holy
[2:01:47] Ghost and their soul sealed but they
[2:01:49] needed another refilling apparently Lord
[2:01:52] and it wasn't that long after the
[2:01:53] initial
[2:01:55] one Lord God I need one today
[2:01:58] Jesus Lord God would your spirit be able
[2:02:02] to come among us today
[2:02:04] Father I'm not asking you for gifts and
[2:02:08] if you want me to have any of that go
[2:02:09] ahead that's that's fine but my desire
[2:02:13] baptize Me In Love
[2:02:15] Lord Lord Jesus may I be dipped immersed
[2:02:20] today in a baptism of love that when I
[2:02:24] come up out of there I will love like I
[2:02:27] have never loved before Oh father it's
[2:02:30] not this Leo to see and stuff I'm
[2:02:32] talking about of compromising and this
[2:02:33] and that I'm talking about holding a
[2:02:36] standard we see an example today of our
[2:02:38] Prophet how we stood his ground and
[2:02:40] stood what he felt like was right but he
[2:02:43] also showed us how to treat people that
[2:02:45] do not agree with what we stand for
[2:02:49] all we can stand and we're going to by
[2:02:51] your help but maybe we've not always had
[2:02:54] the right attitude toward those who
[2:02:57] didn't agree with us Lord baptize me
[2:03:01] today Jesus immerse me into your love
[2:03:04] immerse me oh Lord God I pray in the
[2:03:08] name of Jesus baptize every one of these
[2:03:11] musicians baptize every one of our
[2:03:14] deacons our trustees Our Song leaders
[2:03:17] every man woman boy or girl our Ley our
[2:03:19] youth our youth leaders every one of us
[2:03:21] Lord God baptize us into such a baptism
[2:03:26] of love that we will leave this place
[2:03:29] today and saying by the grace of God I
[2:03:32] am
[2:03:33] changed I am changed I've been a
[2:03:36] Christian for 50 years or whatever more
[2:03:38] of my life but may each of us be able to
[2:03:41] say by the grace of God I am
[2:03:45] changed Hallelujah I am changed
[2:03:50] oh Jesus we were unlovable and you loved
[2:03:53] us now if you are living in us help us
[2:03:56] to love the unlovable help us to love
[2:03:59] the drunk the liar The Prostitute maybe
[2:04:03] the brother the sister that has
[2:04:05] trespassed against us help us Lord to
[2:04:08] forgive even as you forgave to love even
[2:04:12] as you loved Lord God oh Father fill us
[2:04:16] with that type of love then if if you so
[2:04:19] desire let these spiritual gifts fall
[2:04:22] among us but Lord let it be on the basis
[2:04:26] and the foundation of divine love if not
[2:04:30] it will cause one trouble after another
[2:04:33] but if we can get baptize in the real
[2:04:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost it won't be
[2:04:39] about my tongues or my prophecy or my
[2:04:42] Visions or my this or my that it'll be
[2:04:45] about the Church of the Living God it
[2:04:47] won't be about somebody claps longer for
[2:04:50] them than they did for me it won't be
[2:04:52] well I don't get to sing as much as they
[2:04:54] do it's not about us as an individual
[2:04:58] it's about the body of Jesus Christ we
[2:05:02] worship you today we love you father oh
[2:05:05] May the Holy Ghost I pray fill every
[2:05:08] fiber of my being Lord God oh Jesus how
[2:05:12] could I ever forget that day Lord when

[2:05:17] church there in the spirit of God so
[2:05:20] touch me yes that was a portion of your
[2:05:22] spirit how could I ever forget it Lord I
[2:05:25] remember as long as I'm in my right mind
[2:05:27] but oh Jesus May something happen to me
[2:05:30] today even greater than that Lord May
[2:05:33] such a baptism of Love engulf our souls
[2:05:37] that we will find our hearts our souls

[2:05:51] we can't wait to get to the house of God
[2:05:54] because we're so in love and Lord may we
