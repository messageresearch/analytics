[4:37] The Lord thy God is with

[5:23] thee. Do not be.
[5:26] Oh yes. Do not be. Sing it to him this
[5:30] morning, church. Walk in faith and
[5:33] victory.
[5:35] Walk in faith and victory. Let's stand
[5:38] to our feet if you will. Walk in faith
[5:40] and
[5:41] victory of the Lord.
[5:44] Oh, let's sing it to him with all your
[5:48] heart. Oh, be bold. Be strong. Be

[5:57] thee. Be bold. Be strong. Be strong. Oh,

[6:25] For the Lord,
[6:27] my
[6:28] God is
[6:30] with
[6:35] [Applause]
[6:38] me.
[6:40] Hallelujah. Somebody say, "It's the
[6:42] truth." Anyway, it's praise the Lord.
[6:45] Ain't it good to be in the house of God
[6:46] today? Now, most of you are not armed
[6:49] this morning. Probably not carrying
[6:52] guns. And probably most of you don't
[6:54] have switchblades. At least I hope
[6:57] not or concealed weapons of some sort.
[7:01] But you're carrying the greatest one of
[7:02] the greatest weapons you could carry
[7:04] this morning. That's the power of
[7:06] worship.
[7:08] You as a flawed human being with all
[7:11] your faults and all your failures, you
[7:13] come into a building with all your
[7:15] problems that you've got, the devil
[7:17] beating you to death with every one of
[7:18] them. But you can lift your hands and
[7:20] lift your voice and clap your hands and
[7:23] worship your creator. You're packing a
[7:26] great weapon today. Why don't you use it
[7:28] for the glory of God? Use that weapon
[7:32] today. Run into the camp right
[7:36] quick. Run into the camp. Tell everybody
[7:41] get ready. Get
[7:43] ready. Oh, run into the
[7:46] camp. All righty. Get ready. Get
[7:51] ready. Are you ready to take the land?
[7:55] Thank you, Lord. Are you ready to take a
[7:58] stand?
[7:59] Are you ready to take your land for the
[8:03] Lord?
[8:05] My
[8:06] God is
[8:08] with thee. Oh, be bold. Be bold. Be
[8:13] strong. Be strong. Oh, the Lord thy God
[8:16] is with thee. Be
[8:20] be strong. Be strong. Oh, the Lord thy
[8:23] God is with
[8:26] thee. Do not be afraid.
[8:30] Do not be
[8:33] afraid. We're walking in faith and
[8:37] victory. Walking in faith and victory.
[8:42] walking in faith and victory. For the
[8:46] Lord, the Lord, my God, my God is
[8:50] with
[8:55] me. Give him a good hand clap of praise
[8:57] if you love him
[9:01] today. Praise the Lord. Well, it's so
[9:04] good to be in the house of God, isn't
[9:05] it? You glad you're here? Look at your
[9:08] neighbor and tell them you're glad
[9:09] they're here.
[9:11] Amen. What a privilege it is to be in
[9:13] the house of God. If you're visiting
[9:15] with us today, we certainly want to say
[9:16] we welcome you to our assembly. Pray
[9:19] that God would just bless you and may
[9:22] you feel welcome because you are welcome
[9:24] here this morning. And we want you to
[9:26] feel that way. Visitors, God bless you.
[9:29] All of our streamers locally and around
[9:31] the world, we want to say God bless all
[9:32] of those folks as well. Could we give
[9:34] all these people a good hand this
[9:36] morning if you will?
[9:40] Praise the Lord. We're going to look at
[9:41] her prayer request. We don't have that
[9:42] many. If you'll just stand with me while
[9:45] we do that. Sister Barbara Grley needs
[9:48] prayer for an issue in her foot. She
[9:49] cannot walk this morning. So, we're
[9:51] asking that the Lord would be mindful.
[9:53] Pam Britt sends us in to please keep me
[9:55] and my family in your prayers. We lost
[9:58] my oldest daughter unexpectedly on
[10:00] Friday. So, we're just asking that God
[10:03] would be with those folks. Brother
[10:04] Carter Lawson says, "Pray for my son.
[10:06] He's having medical problems and no
[10:09] medical insurance. Prayers for salvation
[10:11] and that the Lord will make a way. We
[10:13] believe God's able to do that, don't we?
[10:15] Amen. Sister Ruth Louise Jax has a very
[10:18] urgent prayer request. Would like for
[10:20] you to remember her today. Brother Jim
[10:22] Cosner uh requests that the church
[10:25] remember his granddaughter Abigail Cook
[10:27] in prayer suffering from colitis. So we
[10:30] want to remember that request today as
[10:32] we pray. Brother Glenn Tamblinson wants
[10:34] us to remember brother uh Ron Ogle in
[10:38] prayer. He's in the hospital in Phoenix.
[10:40] Very critical. Been on a ventilator for
[10:42] three weeks. So we're asking that God
[10:44] would be mindful of that situation. Uh
[10:47] also he had brother
[10:49] Timlinson has a CT scan this coming
[10:52] Wednesday. I ask for full deliverance
[10:54] from the tumor that you've been praying
[10:56] for me about. Prayer. pray that God will
[10:59] continue to shrink it or let let it be
[11:01] totally gone. Our Lord is faithful to
[11:03] his word. By his stripes, I am healed.
[11:06] So, we want to commit that to the Lord.
[11:08] Uh Naen Finch Lawson says, "Unspoken
[11:11] prayer requests for my son Tommy. Thank
[11:13] you and may God bless." Then we have a
[11:15] card of thanks from brother Greg May.
[11:18] Dear saints, I want to thank all of you
[11:20] for your prayers, text message, cards,
[11:22] flowers with the passing of my mother.
[11:25] It meant the world. It's a blessing
[11:27] being part of this wonderful church.
[11:29] Well, we're blessed to have those folks
[11:30] with us also. Right. Give brother and
[11:32] sister May a good hand this morning if
[11:34] you
[11:36] would. Praise the Lord. All the unspoken
[11:39] prayer requests. I know there's great
[11:40] needs in our group today. We just want
[11:42] to commit all these things under the
[11:44] Lord. Brother David, if you'd come this
[11:45] morning, take us to the Lord in
[11:48] prayer. We just commit all these things
[11:50] under the Lord. Love, Brother David,
[11:52] don't we? Amen, buddy. God bless you.
[11:54] Appreciate you.
[11:56] Let's bow our hearts. Precious Lord,
[12:00] once again, Lord, we're grateful to come
[12:01] into your house. We're thankful for all
[12:04] your many blessings, Lord, and your
[12:06] mercy that you extend to us. Lord, words
[12:09] can't express how much we love you. And
[12:11] we just pray that you'd come in our
[12:13] midst this morning, Lord. We commit
[12:16] ourselves to you. We just we commit
[12:18] these requests to you, Lord. each one
[12:21] each one that was written. It's it's
[12:22] special to the individual and you're
[12:25] you're mindful of each one, Lord. And
[12:26] you're more than able to meet each need.
[12:29] We're not to tell you how to meet it.
[12:30] Lord, you just said you'd meet it. And
[12:32] so, we'll just trust and rest and
[12:34] believe, Lord. We'll always remember the
[12:36] ABCs. Accept, believe, and
[12:39] confess. Help us not to stop confessing,
[12:41] Lord, because you're the high priest of
[12:43] our confession. Pray for this service,
[12:46] Lord, that you'd come into our midst
[12:48] now. Just reveal yourself to us, Lord.
[12:51] We need you. The hour is late. We've
[12:53] assembled
[12:54] together. The time's clock definitely is
[12:57] striking the hour, Lord. We know that
[12:59] Jesus will soon descend. Help us, Lord,
[13:02] prepare our hearts. Anoint this service.
[13:04] We commit ourselves to you in Jesus
[13:06] name. Amen.
[13:08] Thank you, brother David. God bless you.
[13:10] Ushers, if you'd like to come this
[13:11] morning, receive the morning tithe and
[13:13] offering you unto the Lord. Look at your
[13:15] neighbor, shake their hand, tell them,
[13:17] "God bless
[13:18] you." Praise the
[13:21] Lord. Amen. It's the quietest place I
[13:25] ever seen in my life this morning. Now,
[13:28] the air conditioning is not in your
[13:30] favor this morning, so we're just uh
[13:32] we're going to have a great time here
[13:33] anyway, right? Somebody say, "Praise the
[13:36] Lord."
[13:37] Give the Lord another good hand clap of
[13:38] praise this morning. Sing.
[13:46] High upon a
[13:50] mountain from where he
[13:54] ascended, the angel of the
[13:59] Lord declared that it would be Oh yes.
[14:04] Amen.
[14:06] He said, "Don't you stand here
[14:09] grieving." Thank you, Lord, for the one
[14:12] that you see leaving. And like man's
[14:17] coming back just like he
[14:22] said. Oh, and I
[14:25] believe he's coming back like he said.
[14:33] I believe a trump is going to sound so
[14:37] loud. He'll
[14:40] resurrect our
[14:44] dead in the twinkling of an eye. He's
[14:49] going to split the sky. And I
[14:54] believe he's coming back like he said.
[15:01] Oh, and I believe the time is nearing
[15:07] that we'll soon see his
[15:10] appearing. Oh, this could be the hour.
[15:16] Oh, this could be the
[15:21] day when the bride from every
[15:26] nation starts to lose
[15:30] gravitation in the middle of the air.
[15:36] become
[15:39] away. And I
[15:41] believe he's coming back like he
[15:46] [Applause]
[15:49] said. I believe a trump is going to
[15:52] sound so loud. He'll
[15:56] resurrect our
[16:00] dead in
[16:02] between of an eye. He's going to split
[16:07] the eastern sky. I
[16:10] believe he's coming back like he said.
[16:16] Brother Justin Reagan, if you'll come on
[16:18] the platform. believe that time is
[16:22] nearing when we'll soon see his
[16:26] appearance. Thank you, Lord. Oh, this
[16:29] could be the hour. I believe it. Don't
[16:32] you? I wish this would be the
[16:37] day when his bride from every
[16:42] nation starts to lose
[16:46] gravitation in the middle of the air
[16:52] be away.
[16:55] [Applause]
[16:56] I
[16:57] believe he's coming back like he
[17:04] said. I believe a trumpet's going to
[17:08] sound so loud. to
[17:11] resurrect our
[17:15] dead in between love and
[17:20] I want to split the eastern sky and I
[17:26] believe he's coming back like he
[17:32] say oh in the twinkling of an eye he's
[17:39] going to splend in the eastern sky. And
[17:43] I
[17:44] believe he's coming back like he
[17:50] said. Just like he
[17:58] said.
[17:59] Hallelujah. Give the Lord a real good
[18:01] hand clap of praise this morning. Thank
[18:04] you, Lord. Want to enjoy Brother Justin
[18:07] as he gets ready to sing. Then brother
[18:09] Harry has a song. You can be seated this
[18:23] morning.
[18:25] David sang the
[18:27] praises of the
[18:29] glory of
[18:32] Jehovah. Paul
[18:34] preached all is lost. same knowing
[18:42] Christ. Little John said he is
[18:46] precious while
[18:49] leaning on his bosom. So for a
[18:54] moment, may I
[18:56] humbly
[19:01] testify? Did I mention that I love him?
[19:06] How I worship and adore him when I can
[19:13] see no way. He makes a
[19:19] way. And did I mention he's been
[19:24] faithful to every promise he's ever made
[19:29] me?
[19:30] I love him. And that's all I want to
[19:39] [Music]
[19:44] say. And how many sermons could be
[19:50] preached about my Jesus? How many songs
[19:56] can be sung
[19:59] about God's
[20:00] [Music]
[20:03] son? There are
[20:05] not enough
[20:07] words, enough notes in the music to tell
[20:13] the story about my Savior and all he's
[20:19] done.
[20:22] And did I mention that I love him? How I
[20:28] worship and adore him? When I can see no
[20:35] way, he makes a
[20:40] way. And did I mention he's been
[20:44] faithful in every promise he's ever made
[20:50] me? I love him and that's all I want to
[20:59] say. And did I mention he's been
[21:03] faithful in every promise he's ever made
[21:09] me? I love him and that's all I want to
[21:16] say.
[21:18] [Music]
[21:22] [Applause]
[21:30] [Music]
[21:34] Brothers, if you put the words to it's
[21:36] my desire up, we we'll all just sing
[21:39] this. Is it your desire?
[21:45] Do you believe what we're hearing
[21:47] preached? Do you feel the call to be the
[21:50] stature of a perfect man?
[21:54] That's what he's looking for. Brother
[21:56] Brandon preached it in '
[21:59] 62. But somebody someday
[22:02] somewhere, it's going to be flesh in
[22:06] somebody. And I just believe by God's
[22:08] grace that we're part of that that
[22:11] somebody body. Amen. It's
[22:14] my
[22:19] desire to live for
[22:23] [Music]
[22:26] Jesus. It's
[22:28] my
[22:33] desire to live for him.
[22:39] [Music]
[22:42] So
[22:43] often I failed
[22:48] him and brought
[22:51] him
[22:55] shame. It's
[22:57] my
[22:59] [Music]
[23:02] desire to
[23:05] live for him.
[23:09] [Music]
[23:10] Oh, if you could
[23:14] see where Jesus brought me
[23:19] from to where I am
[23:25] today. You would know the
[23:30] reason why I love him so.
[23:39] And you can take this
[23:44] world, its wealth and
[23:47] [Music]
[23:48] riches. I don't need a shame. It's my
[23:59] desire to live for
[24:06] him. It's
[24:08] my
[24:13] desire to help
[24:17] someone today.
[24:20] [Music]
[24:21] Someone who may have
[24:26] failed to
[24:29] see the
[24:34] way for I to once was
[24:40] lost but I found my way to God.
[24:48] It's my
[24:54] desire to live for
[25:01] him. If you could
[25:05] see where Jesus brought me from to where
[25:12] I am today.
[25:16] You know the
[25:20] reason why I love him.
[25:28] So now you can take this world its
[25:35] wealth and
[25:38] riches. I don't
[25:40] want fame. It's my
[25:48] desire to live for him.
[25:56] If
[25:57] you could
[25:59] see where Jesus brought me from to where
[26:06] I am
[26:08] today, then you would
[26:13] know the reason why I love him.
[26:22] So now you can take this world, it's
[26:28] wealth and
[26:31] riches. I don't need earth's fame. It's
[26:37] my
[26:42] desire. It's my desire.
[26:49] It's
[26:50] my
[26:55] desire to live for him.
[27:04] [Music]
[27:10] [Applause]
[27:13] to
[27:14] see where he brought me
[27:18] from to where I
[27:22] am
[27:25] today. You would
[27:27] know the
[27:29] reason why I love him
[27:36] so. Hallelujah.
[27:40] You can take this
[27:43] world
[27:45] wealth and
[27:47] riches. I don't want earth's
[27:52] fame. It's my
[27:57] desire. Hallelujah. To live for
[28:01] [Music]
[28:06] you. Hallelujah.
[28:11] Lord Jesus, I
[28:13] trust, I hope, I
[28:15] pray. That's the desire of every person
[28:18] that's here
[28:21] today. Sure, we have other goals, other
[28:24] motives, other objectives that pertain
[28:26] to life itself. And we don't want to be
[28:29] so heavenly minded that we're no earthly
[28:32] good. But neither do we want to be so
[28:34] earthly minded, we're no heavenly good.
[28:38] We search for the balance of it all,
[28:40] Lord. But all we know is when there is
[28:43] no more United
[28:45] States, one day Johnson City will be
[28:48] laying in smoldering heaps of
[28:51] ashes, our houses, our cars, our bank
[28:56] accounts, all
[28:59] gone. When that great hour comes, that's
[29:03] when it's really going to matter what
[29:05] we've desired the
[29:07] most. This is the reason we've gathered
[29:10] today. Lord, your prophet has told us
[29:12] that we come to church to find out where
[29:16] our faults
[29:17] are. That certainly isn't why most
[29:19] leadyans go to church. Yeah. They go to
[29:22] get their ears tickled and told how good
[29:25] they are. But we've come today that we
[29:28] can find out our
[29:30] shortcomings so that we can become
[29:33] better people in your
[29:35] grace. Speak to us today, Father. We
[29:37] pray in the name of
[29:40] Jesus. Amen.
[29:43] Praise the Lord.
[29:46] Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[29:51] after
[29:52] righteousness, for they shall be fil
[29:57] filled. If that's our desire today, then
[30:00] our God is obligated to fulfill that
[30:02] promise.
[30:04] Second Peter chapter 1 verse two.
[30:10] welcome you today in the presence of the
[30:12] Lord to be gathered together here in the
[30:14] house of God.
[30:17] I love to go to church. I love to go to
[30:21] church. I'm just God saved me to go to
[30:24] church. I realize a lot of folks say
[30:26] they got saved and they have no desire
[30:27] to go to church. I got saved by a
[30:30] different savior than
[30:32] that. I got saved by one who wants me to
[30:35] go to church and I want to go to church.
[30:40] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[30:43] through the knowledge of God and of
[30:45] Jesus our
[30:47] Lord. According as his divine power hath
[30:51] given unto us all things that pertain
[30:55] unto life and
[30:57] godliness through the knowledge of him.
[31:01] Notice in verse two, the knowledge of
[31:03] God. Here he calls it the knowledge of
[31:05] him that hath called us unto glory and
[31:10] virtue, whereby given unto us exceeding
[31:13] great and precious promises, that by
[31:16] these ye might be partakers of the
[31:20] divine nature. What an honor. Having
[31:24] escaped the corruption that is in the
[31:26] world through lust, and beside this,
[31:30] giving all diligence, add minister,
[31:33] nourishment, supply, furnish. Add to
[31:36] your faith virtue to virtue knowledge to
[31:40] knowledge temperance to temperance.
[31:42] Patience to patience. Listen to this
[31:45] now. godliness and to godliness,
[31:48] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[31:51] kindness, charity. God bless you. May
[31:54] the Lord bless his word. You may be
[31:56] seated.
[32:06] Truly the man, the woman, the boy, the
[32:10] girl that possesses these things in
[32:13] their walk, in their soul, in their
[32:17] life will
[32:20] never
[32:24] fail. You could have great signs and
[32:27] wonders that would follow your life and
[32:30] not have all of these. You could go to
[32:33] church faithfully.
[32:35] You could sell your house, your cars,
[32:37] all your property. You could even give
[32:40] your body to be
[32:41] burned. Sacrifice everything you've
[32:44] worked for your entire life.
[32:47] And you could do that without these.
[32:50] So Peter goes on to say, "Those that
[32:52] lack these things are blind and do not
[32:56] remember from where they came from, and
[32:59] they can't see a far off."
[33:02] It's no wonder to me that God so
[33:04] inspired Peter. I remember this man at
[33:07] one time was so ignorant and unlearned.
[33:11] That was the way the common people of
[33:13] that day knew him. He was an ignorant
[33:16] man. Couldn't write. Probably couldn't
[33:19] read. But look what God did for this man
[33:22] to bring him to such a place that he
[33:25] would be able to write words which have
[33:28] been read, discussed, talked about for
[33:31] 2,000 years. And the majority of people
[33:35] on the earth will never be able to come
[33:39] to what you and I just read. Think of
[33:41] it. People go to church for years of
[33:43] their life. Preachers will stand in the
[33:46] pullpit and
[33:47] preach, do mission
[33:49] trips, sacrifice years of their lives,
[33:54] and never be able to attain to what we
[33:56] just read.
[33:57] And it's not because that you and I is
[33:59] any better because we're just as low
[34:01] down as anybody else. And we all need
[34:03] help, do we not?
[34:06] So, how is it that we desire to have
[34:09] such things? And the majority of
[34:12] Christendom reads over
[34:14] I'll never be able to do that anyway, so
[34:15] I'll just do the best I can and give God
[34:17] what whatever, you know, whatever I can
[34:19] do is what I'll do, and God will have to
[34:21] take it. No, that's not the way our God
[34:23] is. God has demands and God has
[34:27] requirements and God will absolutely
[34:30] produce a people that will meet his
[34:33] requirements. So whatever type of a
[34:35] woman that it is,
[34:37] woman/church that leaves the world in a
[34:39] rapture shows us what kind of God he is.
[34:44] So if liars, whoreongers, filthy,
[34:47] ungodly living people go in a rapture,
[34:50] that proves to me Jesus is a liar. He's
[34:54] a whoreonger. Jesus is filthy. He's
[34:57] rotten. He's low down. Oh my sir. Come
[35:01] on now. Come on.
[35:04] Well, if one of our brothers would marry
[35:06] a street
[35:07] walker, if one of our brothers would
[35:10] marry a woman that's as filthy as she
[35:12] can be, or our sisters, vice
[35:15] versa, that I don't care how much they
[35:17] say they love God and what a great
[35:19] testimony they have. To me, who they
[35:22] marry tells who they really are. Come
[35:24] on. Amen. It's the same of the Lord
[35:27] Jesus. So whoever goes in the rapture
[35:30] that we are believing is near us and
[35:33] expectation in our heart, whoever goes
[35:36] in the rapture because it's evident you
[35:38] can join a church but you can't join the
[35:40] rapture.
[35:42] You you just can't join it. You you've
[35:44] got to have a supernatural power and
[35:46] it'll take the power of God to change
[35:48] every individual that goes in that
[35:50] rapture. And then the individuals that
[35:52] make up the rapture have a personal
[35:55] approval from God that they have met his
[35:59] requirement. And he will prove it by
[36:02] changing their bodies. So it'll be more
[36:05] than saying, "I'm a Christian. I go to
[36:07] church. I'm a preacher. I'm a deacon. I
[36:09] I do this. I do that." All that's well
[36:12] and good, but that's still not personal
[36:14] vindication that he approves of you and
[36:17] accepts you as his wife. So whoever it
[36:20] is around the world that's going to be
[36:22] taken in a rapture in a body change,
[36:25] each of them will have a personal
[36:27] approval from the presence of almighty
[36:29] God that they have met his requirement.
[36:33] And these virtues will be in them and
[36:36] not only in them in a miniature tiny
[36:40] form, but they will be fruitful. They
[36:42] will be bringing forth and they will be
[36:45] ministering one to the other to the
[36:47] other until they become so fruitful in
[36:50] the presence of God that God can crown
[36:53] each one of them with a body change. And
[36:57] those that have lived previous to us in
[36:59] the ages before us that have arrived to
[37:02] this spot, they will receive a personal
[37:06] approval by the release of their
[37:08] theophony from under the altar of God.
[37:12] and their theophony will come down in a
[37:14] moment, in a twinkling of an eye, and
[37:17] they will call their own bodies from the
[37:20] dust of the earth.
[37:22] That's pretty good approval if you ask
[37:24] me. That's a whole lot more than just
[37:26] dropping $5 in the offering. That's a
[37:29] whole lot more than saying, "Well, I
[37:30] belong to Word of Life and I go here and
[37:32] I sing specials and I'm I'm the choir
[37:34] director." Oh, that's really good. But
[37:36] still yet, I wanted approval that one
[37:39] day if I'm an old man, maybe I should
[37:41] set this way, an older man, that the
[37:45] power of God will so approve of the life
[37:47] that I live that he will change me back
[37:51] to an 18-year-old boy. Is that the kind
[37:55] of approval you want? Do we want the
[37:57] approval of people or do we want the
[38:00] approval of God? Amen. Now remember,
[38:02] there's an element of this and the
[38:04] prophet tells us when he preached the
[38:06] statue of a perfect man that there are
[38:08] people that have many of these things
[38:11] naturally on their own. So they can have
[38:13] an element of faith, element of virtue,
[38:15] knowledge, temperance, all those things.
[38:17] But yet the kind we want is actually the
[38:21] kind that comes from the fountain and
[38:24] the source of eternal life, which is
[38:26] Jesus Christ himself. I don't want my
[38:29] faith. I don't want yours. and you don't
[38:31] want mine because mine will will run
[38:34] out. But I want the faith of the Lord
[38:37] Jesus. So with the faith of the Lord
[38:40] Jesus, I could look at any obstacle and
[38:43] still believe him. So when I ask him for
[38:45] things and he says, "No, no, no, Donnie.
[38:51] I'm not giving it to you. No, this is
[38:54] out of my will. It does not please me
[38:58] that I won't pout. I won't get all
[39:00] upset. I I ain't going back no more with
[39:04] the faith of Jesus. I'll say what Jesus
[39:06] said. Nevertheless, not my will, but thy
[39:10] will be done. Because God the Father
[39:12] told Jesus Christ, "No."
[39:17] And Jesus didn't get mad. Jesus didn't
[39:20] start skipping out on church and say,
[39:21] "Well, I ain't going back to church no
[39:23] more. I prayed and the father loved me
[39:24] and he said he lived in me and he he
[39:26] abided in me and I asked him to spare me
[39:29] of the cross and he wouldn't do it. So I
[39:30] ain't going back. I matter of fact I
[39:32] ain't going back to heaven no more. I'm
[39:33] just going to pout on God. You know but
[39:35] what did he say? Not my will but thy
[39:37] will be done. How many wants that kind
[39:40] of faith? Now watch. The prophet said,
[39:42] "Now when we put the blood of Jesus
[39:44] Christ in sin, that brings the faith of
[39:46] Jesus Christ, the virtue of Jesus
[39:49] Christ, the knowledge of Jesus Christ,
[39:52] the temperance of Jesus Christ, the
[39:54] patience of Jesus Christ." So this is
[39:57] not you and I struggling and trying to
[39:59] produce it. It's us yielding ourself and
[40:02] doing our part of the requirement and
[40:05] letting the life of God live his own
[40:07] virtues out of us. Now remember though
[40:10] when that happens that there'll still be
[40:12] that battle between his faith, virtue
[40:16] and strength and knowledge and so on
[40:18] battling against your flesh because you
[40:22] still are living in this prison house
[40:25] and circumstances and events will arise
[40:28] around you and the devil will always
[40:31] want you to respond first by this.
[40:35] That's right. By this. Let this do the
[40:38] talking. Let this make the decisions.
[40:40] Let this determine how you feel.
[40:42] Emergencies come up and things are
[40:44] absolutely so difficult and the devil
[40:47] wants us to respond by this first
[40:49] instead of being patient waiting and let
[40:52] the faith of Jesus respond. Let the
[40:55] knowledge of Jesus respond. Notice the
[40:59] bottom of the paragraph there. He said,
[41:00] "This is the perfect man of
[41:03] God when he possesses these virtues."
[41:07] Now, whenever we look at what God
[41:10] anointed Peter to write and he starts
[41:12] out with faith and virtue, then he goes
[41:14] to knowledge. And we looked at it
[41:15] before, of course, that many folks think
[41:17] knowledge is just knowing scripture and
[41:19] knowing the message. But the divine
[41:22] knowledge of God involves so many things
[41:25] of our everyday life. It's knowledge
[41:28] about how to deal with one another. It's
[41:31] knowledge about how to respond in
[41:33] circumstances. It's knowledge on how to
[41:36] be able to divide ourselves from
[41:39] unbelief, but be able to pray for those
[41:42] that we disagree with. You see, the
[41:45] knowledge of God, if we can ever tap
[41:48] into that in the right way, you'll be
[41:50] surprised how much it'll help you in the
[41:52] life that you live, even in the trials
[41:56] and the difficulties of life. I love the
[41:58] way he said it this way. Knowledge not
[42:01] worldly. It reasons. any kind of worldly
[42:04] knowledge, reason. See, but faith has no
[42:07] reason. God reveals to you a certain
[42:09] certain thing that's going to happen.
[42:11] Every scientist in the world could say
[42:14] it's contrary. It could not happen, but
[42:16] you believe it anyhow. Now, watch. I
[42:18] thought he was talking about knowledge.
[42:20] He was. But notice how he pull knowledge
[42:23] and faith together. You see, sometimes
[42:26] knowledge will couple itself together
[42:29] with temperance. Sometimes knowledge
[42:31] might couple itself together with
[42:33] brotherly kindness to give you knowledge
[42:36] to know how to deal with your brothers
[42:38] when things are going on. That's kind of
[42:40] rubbing this old flesh right here.
[42:43] Praise the Lord. So, it's not like that
[42:45] these things work independently alone by
[42:49] themsel all the time. And there may be
[42:51] issues in your life that you'll need all
[42:55] seven of them at one time
[42:58] to help us. one issue and then there
[43:01] might be other issues that one will be
[43:04] the predominant one. faith will come up
[43:07] my it's got them mighty muscles hair on
[43:09] its chest as the prophet says and all
[43:11] the rest of the virtue says go ahead
[43:13] brother faith take care of it boy faith
[43:16] steps to the forefront of the battle and
[43:18] they're still there but faith is the one
[43:20] that's needed other times it'll be
[43:22] brotherly kindness and faith will just
[43:24] bear back because faith can come on so
[43:27] strong at times oh hallelujah let me add
[43:31] glory to
[43:32] God when sometimes you need brotherly
[43:35] kindness.
[43:37] So sometimes it's not always how loud we
[43:40] scream and how tough we want to make our
[43:44] faith be known. Brotherly kindness can
[43:47] submit itself to one who's going through
[43:50] a tremendous trial. And your faith may
[43:53] be bulldog face and you want to reach
[43:56] and grab a hold of them and man, what in
[43:58] the world's matter with you? Straighten
[44:00] up.
[44:03] But brotherly kindness will look at them
[44:05] and maybe divine knowledge of God will
[44:08] remind you of discernments when people
[44:10] would come through the prayer line and
[44:12] the prophet would tell them people have
[44:15] told you to get next to yourself.
[44:20] But you can't.
[44:26] Faith has its place. A lot of us have
[44:29] made fools of oursel.
[44:34] with our great powerful strong faith.
[44:40] No doubt we've displeased the Lord
[44:42] greatly so many times because we've used
[44:45] our faith instead of temperance,
[44:49] brotherly kindness,
[44:52] and knowledge
[44:54] to be able to
[44:55] acond to a brother or sister that's not
[44:59] as strong as what you are.
[45:02] So you see the
[45:03] element that God wants us to be able to
[45:06] understand how to live and do is to know
[45:10] that there's a great spiritual
[45:13] pride that goes with any supernatural
[45:17] thing that God God does for
[45:20] us. This is what
[45:22] destroys many preachers, many churches,
[45:27] singers, musicians, so on.
[45:30] But what we want is the kind of
[45:33] knowledge that will help us when we're
[45:36] dealing with various situations in our
[45:39] life that God will give us the direction
[45:41] that we need. And I think it's pretty
[45:43] evident by some of the decisions that
[45:45] I've made. And uh I'll go ahead and
[45:47] include you all just so you feel
[45:49] included that from from looking at you
[45:52] all and pastoring many of y'all for many
[45:54] years. It it it it kind of just you know
[45:57] I'm just convinced that many of you all
[45:59] needed more godly knowledge as well. You
[46:02] wouldn't be in the situation that you're
[46:04] in today had you followed the leading of
[46:07] God. So this type of knowledge, it helps
[46:11] us in dealing with one another. It helps
[46:14] us to deal with trials and test. It will
[46:18] help us when God will do something
[46:21] phenomenal for us in our life. And it
[46:24] will give us knowledge to know how do we
[46:27] relate that to others? Do we share that
[46:31] or was that just for us and God to know?
[46:35] That's good.
[46:37] God has a hard time finding
[46:41] people that he can deal with and then
[46:45] still stay humble.
[46:48] You see, when you ask for something and
[46:50] you don't get it, knowledge, divine
[46:53] knowledge can help you to accept and
[46:57] know that the perfect will of
[46:59] God sometimes will bring such pain.
[47:06] So, which would most of us rather have a
[47:09] miracle or a death?
[47:14] If you have a a loved one that that's a
[47:16] point of death, a child, a daughter, a
[47:18] husband, a
[47:19] wife, and we could choose. Which one
[47:22] would we choose?
[47:24] Which one would we choose for our
[47:26] testimony to be? I was the one that was
[47:28] blind. I was the one that was lame. I
[47:31] was the one that crippled and they
[47:32] prayed for me. Glory to God. And we
[47:34] think that's a great testimony. You ever
[47:36] notice we don't have testimony meetings
[47:38] for those that God said no to?
[47:44] Come on. I get all the prayer requests
[47:46] and all the testimonies. Most of the
[47:48] time I have the speaker off back there
[47:49] because I'm praying. So I don't hear
[47:51] what's going on out here. So the song
[47:54] leaders will lay them on my desk and I
[47:56] take them home and I open each one and I
[47:59] pray over
[48:01] them. But it's amazing the testimonies.
[48:05] Well, I had this and this and brother
[48:07] Daryl prayed for me. Praise the Lord.
[48:08] God heal me. I had this and God healed
[48:12] me. But it's amazing. We don't get no
[48:15] testimonies. I asked God to heal me and
[48:18] God said no. But I love him now more
[48:21] than I've ever loved him. Amen. You know
[48:25] why? We don't deem that a testimony
[48:29] worth sharing.
[48:31] Cuz in our thinking, this is the way
[48:33] that we believe it. We have a need. God
[48:37] answers it according to what many times
[48:39] we think and then we want to testify
[48:45] or would you think somebody would think
[48:46] less of you because you had a need and
[48:49] request and you begged God. You didn't
[48:51] just ask, you begged
[48:54] God and God said no. You want anybody to
[48:57] know that about you?
[49:00] Good preaching
[49:02] knowledge.
[49:04] Wonderful thing to have, right? Yeah.
[49:08] You see, divine knowledge gives us that
[49:10] spot to where we understand he's perfect
[49:15] and he makes no mistakes.
[49:17] And from where we're looking at it, we
[49:20] cannot see all that he can see. So for
[49:22] us, and he doesn't fault us for that, of
[49:25] course, because he knows we have such
[49:27] limited spiritual insight. Even in the
[49:31] natural things of life, the way we look
[49:32] at them, we evaluate them. Who in the
[49:35] right mind would have ever told General
[49:38] Joshua to go down there and march around
[49:42] the walls of Jericho? Facts. No walls
[49:46] had ever fallen, no historical proof or
[49:49] record that any such walls had ever
[49:52] fallen just by people marching around
[49:54] them and shouting. So, who in their
[49:57] right mind would think that would work?
[49:59] But God's knowledge says, "This is going
[50:02] to be the first time I want to do it."
[50:04] G. So what Joshua do? Exactly what God
[50:07] told him to do. Why? Because there was
[50:10] an element there that he didn't
[50:12] understand. He said, "You know what? God
[50:14] knows more about tearing down walls than
[50:16] I do. So I'm just going to trust him.
[50:19] I'm going to believe it." And yet
[50:22] whenever it comes to that, look at what
[50:24] Paul said in Colossians 1:9. For this
[50:28] cause we also since the day we heard it
[50:31] do not cease to pray for you and to and
[50:34] to desire that you might be filled with
[50:38] the
[50:39] knowledge of his
[50:43] will. Filled. Wonder how our lives would
[50:47] be transformed if every day from this
[50:50] Sunday morning service on we start
[50:53] making it a daily prayer to God. God,
[50:57] fill me with the knowledge of your will
[51:02] for my life. Amen. Some of you would
[51:04] quit struggling with, "Do I have the
[51:06] Holy Ghost? Do I not have the Holy
[51:07] Ghost?" You're looking at your manity
[51:09] and you're looking at this and you're
[51:10] looking for that and you let the devil
[51:12] rob you of your joy. You let the devil
[51:14] rob you, your family, and so on and so
[51:16] on. Because many of you are looking for
[51:19] things that it's not reality. It's not
[51:21] realistic. You're thinking that when a
[51:24] Christian gets the Holy Ghost, my
[51:26] they're just going to hit the high
[51:28] places in life and valleys are something
[51:30] that's gone by. Well, if that's so, they
[51:32] ain't nobody here got the Holy Ghost.
[51:34] Even brother Brandham didn't had it. Cuz
[51:35] I'll tell you one thing, the more loyal
[51:37] you are to God, the more testing you're
[51:40] going to have. Is that right? The more
[51:43] you submit yourself to him, the more he
[51:46] finds you worthy to prove portions of
[51:49] his word that he cannot use baby
[51:53] Christians for.
[51:56] Oh my. So here Paul was praying for the
[52:00] saints at Colass and desire that they
[52:04] might be filled with the knowledge of
[52:06] God in all wisdom and spiritual
[52:09] understanding. Now let's turn if we can
[52:11] to the book of 2 Corinthians and let's
[52:13] read about another display of the
[52:16] knowledge of God dealing with the
[52:18] supernatural realm. I I believe every
[52:20] one of us here today that love the Lord,
[52:23] we love the supernatural. I absolutely
[52:26] love the supernatural realm of God. Now
[52:29] by that I don't mean that it is the
[52:32] natural realm and I try to make it
[52:34] supernatural. God don't need my help to
[52:37] be able to transform things that are
[52:39] natural occurrences into supernatural.
[52:42] But I do believe in the supernatural.
[52:45] Now watch Paul here, the great church
[52:47] age messenger of the first age. And he
[52:49] said, I knew a man in Christ about 14
[52:54] years ago. Whether in the body I cannot
[52:56] tell. Whether out of the body I cannot
[52:59] tell. God knoweth. Such and one caught
[53:03] up to the third heaven. Now remember,
[53:05] brother Brandham said when he went went
[53:07] beyond the curtain of time that he was
[53:10] caught up to the first
[53:13] heaven, the first heaven. But Paul
[53:18] actually went to the third heaven. How
[53:22] that he was caught up into paradise.
[53:26] So now remember paradise before the
[53:28] cross was down next to the dimension of
[53:32] the regions of the lost. But now
[53:35] paradise had been emptied out and
[53:39] relocated. Praise God. Only Jesus can
[53:43] relocate paradise. How that he was
[53:45] caught up into paradise and
[53:49] heard
[53:51] unspeakable words.
[53:54] So Paul was caught up into this
[53:57] realm and heard
[53:59] beings, cherubams, saraphims, angels,
[54:03] God. We don't know. We don't know who
[54:07] was doing the talking. But whatever it
[54:10] was this man heard, they were
[54:13] unspeakable.
[54:15] Now, he didn't, it wasn't that he didn't
[54:18] understand and know what was going on,
[54:21] but when he come back down, he said,
[54:23] "I'm not even
[54:25] allowed to say one of those words."
[54:30] What I heard was so profound.
[54:36] And heard unspeakable words which is not
[54:43] lawful for a man to
[54:48] utter. So it must have been angelic
[54:53] beings that were talking.
[54:56] Wonder what they were saying.
[55:01] And Paul said it was unlawful for him to
[55:03] utter it. Of such and one will I glory.
[55:06] Yet of
[55:08] myself. Now watch how Paul separates the
[55:12] man who went up there from the man who's
[55:15] doing the
[55:17] writing. Now remember, it was not Paul's
[55:21] physical body.
[55:24] It was
[55:25] Paul's
[55:27] hallelujah soul,
[55:30] the seed, the
[55:32] genos of God.
[55:35] Of such a one will I glory. Yet of
[55:37] myself, I will not glory. He said, but
[55:40] in my
[55:41] infirmities, for though I would desire
[55:44] to glory, I shall not be a fool.
[55:49] Wow.
[55:51] So you mean people can glory in the
[55:54] things of
[55:56] God and take it too much to this right
[55:59] here and when we do
[56:02] it we become fools
[56:07] and the church said well the rest of you
[56:10] can say ouch and oh me and help me Lord
[56:14] and all that
[56:16] I shall not be a fool for I will say the
[56:19] truth but now I forbear, lest any man
[56:23] should think of me above that which he
[56:28] seeth me to
[56:30] be. Now, I want you to notice now Paul
[56:33] knowing that he's he he's had a great
[56:36] great ministry with the Lord, but he
[56:39] he's trying to keep the balance of
[56:41] bringing what God showed him and yet
[56:45] struggling with his his view and
[56:48] perception among the people that the
[56:51] people will not make him more than what
[56:53] he is and that he himself will not make
[56:57] him more than what he is.
[57:02] And he says, "Lest I should
[57:05] be
[57:08] exalted above
[57:12] measure. This heavenly experience could
[57:16] have
[57:18] ruined his earthly ministry."
[57:23] But almighty God was
[57:25] determined. He was not going to let that
[57:27] happen. Amen.
[57:31] So God is going to let the devil
[57:35] Yes, sir.
[57:37] the devil, not the Holy
[57:41] Ghost, not great meetings, healings,
[57:43] signs,
[57:45] wonders, but a demon out of
[57:50] hell. Well, glory. Amen.
[57:55] Lest I should be exalted above measure.
[58:00] Look at the word
[58:01] exalted. Exalt oneself. To lift or
[58:05] raise up over something. To lift oneself
[58:11] up.
[58:13] Beaughaughty. To carry oneself hottily.
[58:18] behave
[58:20] insolently towards
[58:23] one. So you mean a man of this caliber
[58:27] that would see such a thing that he
[58:29] couldn't even say anything about the
[58:32] words that he heard, he could just say,
[58:35] "This happened to me, but I can't really
[58:37] tell you all all that was involved in
[58:39] it. I just can't do it. It's it's it's
[58:42] illegal. It's against the law of God for
[58:47] me to even tell you what I
[58:51] heard. But then God looks at it and
[58:53] said, "Paul, because I allowed you to
[58:56] have this,
[58:58] I love you so much,
[59:01] and I ordained you to be my first church
[59:04] age messenger,
[59:06] but Paul, I realize your flesh is
[59:08] unconverted
[59:10] and your body don't have the Holy Ghost.
[59:13] And Paul, you're going to fight pride
[59:18] because your revelations are so so
[59:22] prevalent over Peter, John, James,
[59:27] Bartholomew,
[59:31] Thaddius. Because I've given you such
[59:36] revelations, I'm going to have to put a
[59:38] thorn in your body, Paul.
[59:45] Dear God, help us. Lest I should be
[59:48] exalted above
[59:51] measure through the
[59:55] abundance of the
[59:58] revelations. You got to be kidding
[1:00:01] me. The
[1:00:04] abundance of the revelations. Look at
[1:00:06] this word now. far more exceeding, more
[1:00:09] excellent out of
[1:00:12] measure. Metaphorically,
[1:00:15] superiority, excellence, preeminence
[1:00:19] beyond
[1:00:20] measure.
[1:00:22] Wow. Nobody could write a book of
[1:00:25] Hebrews like Paul.
[1:00:27] Nobody could write a book of Ephesians
[1:00:29] or Philippians or Galatians or Phelimon
[1:00:32] or Colossians or 1 and 2 Thessalonians,
[1:00:34] 1 and 2 Timothy, on and on and on.
[1:00:37] Nobody had the understanding that the
[1:00:39] man had. And Paul said, "God made it
[1:00:42] known to me through what?" Divine
[1:00:46] knowledge.
[1:00:48] A
[1:00:50] knowing sometimes is
[1:00:53] greater than a deliverance. Amen.
[1:00:58] Wow. Amen. Did that go over the top of
[1:01:02] your heads?
[1:01:03] Sometimes a knowing
[1:01:06] a knowing why that you're dealing with
[1:01:09] it. A knowing why it's out loud and
[1:01:14] tolerated. Don't you understand what
[1:01:16] Paul is sharing with us? What father had
[1:01:19] shared with him?
[1:01:22] A divine knowledge about his life. Hey,
[1:01:25] once he once he looks at he said, "Oh,
[1:01:29] okay. It makes perfect sense now, Lord.
[1:01:33] Thank you." Yes, it makes perfect sense.
[1:01:35] So, what did he share with us? Divine
[1:01:38] knowledge.
[1:01:40] Faith would have been wonderful, but
[1:01:41] faith wouldn't have given him this.
[1:01:44] Brotherly kindness. Well, he didn't need
[1:01:46] brotherly kindness. Not in this
[1:01:48] instance. What did he
[1:01:50] need? The knowledge of the will of God.
[1:01:55] God, why am I going through this? I
[1:01:58] don't understand. I love you. If there's
[1:01:59] anything wrong in my life, help me.
[1:02:03] Lest I should be exalted above measure
[1:02:05] through the
[1:02:07] abundance of the revelations.
[1:02:14] It's strange to me that revelations are
[1:02:19] accompanied by thorns.
[1:02:22] That's right.
[1:02:25] Don't raise your hands, but I wonder how
[1:02:26] many of us would definitely want
[1:02:28] revelations.
[1:02:31] Do you want the thorns that come with
[1:02:33] them?
[1:02:38] We can all be honest today, right? That
[1:02:41] we're no better than Paul was. We're not
[1:02:44] near the people that he was and never
[1:02:47] will be.
[1:02:49] Now notice God's answer in the
[1:02:52] attribute. What what's he writing here?
[1:02:54] The knowledge not the knowledge of Paul
[1:02:57] but the knowledge of Jesus
[1:03:00] Christ. So God projected to Paul this
[1:03:05] understanding. This is why I can't take
[1:03:07] it away.
[1:03:10] Paul, you need
[1:03:16] this. Through the abundance of the
[1:03:19] revelations that was given unto
[1:03:21] me, a thorn in the
[1:03:24] flesh, the messenger of
[1:03:29] Satan, a man who talked with
[1:03:32] angels, a man who heard words that we
[1:03:35] still to this
[1:03:37] day don't know what they were.
[1:03:40] That's one of the first things I want to
[1:03:41] ask him when I see him. What were them
[1:03:43] words? What did you see? Tell me now.
[1:03:46] Tell me. Now I can Now I can take it and
[1:03:48] you can take it. What was it that was so
[1:03:53] great? So we're talking about somebody
[1:03:56] filled with the Holy Ghost. Audience
[1:03:59] participation will be appreciated. So
[1:04:01] we're talking about someone filled with
[1:04:03] the Holy Ghost. Amen. We're talking
[1:04:06] about a church age messenger. Amen. A
[1:04:09] prophet of God.
[1:04:14] And he still needed a thorn.
[1:04:18] Why? His body didn't have the Holy
[1:04:20] Ghost. Yours don't either.
[1:04:25] Now notice, he says, "There was given to
[1:04:27] me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger
[1:04:29] of Satan to buffet me."
[1:04:36] Buffet, not possess,
[1:04:41] this is not unclean living.
[1:04:43] Now, but buffet, look at the meaning of
[1:04:47] this word to strike with the
[1:04:52] fist. Oh, bless your little darling
[1:04:56] hearts. Some of you all thought this was
[1:04:59] buffeting, didn't you?
[1:05:02] The way you whip your children.
[1:05:06] Me and Carol was going through TJ Maxx
[1:05:08] the other day and there's a squalling
[1:05:09] young in there that needed my belt on
[1:05:11] its posterior part of its body. And what
[1:05:14] was it? What was it that the mother
[1:05:16] said, Carol, I'm counting to five or
[1:05:17] seven or 10? I I told Carol we stand
[1:05:20] right in front. I said, "It ain't no
[1:05:21] wonder it's squaling. It knows it's got
[1:05:23] four or five more before anything even
[1:05:24] happens."
[1:05:27] Is that right? So, I want you to notice
[1:05:30] the word that he uses now when he
[1:05:32] describes this. But he doesn't have an
[1:05:36] attitude. You see what I'm saying? So
[1:05:38] he's not saying, "God, what in the
[1:05:39] world? I mean, you're the one who showed
[1:05:41] me that. Why don't you just leave me
[1:05:42] alone? If it was going to cause me all
[1:05:44] this trouble, why don't you just leave
[1:05:46] me? Let me be a dumb son. Just let me be
[1:05:49] dumb. Just let me walk on the earth and
[1:05:51] just kind of, you know, just struggle
[1:05:52] along. You're you're the one that's
[1:05:54] responsible. It's all your fault."
[1:05:58] Amen. But you see, divine knowledge
[1:06:00] helps you in the midst of your trial to
[1:06:03] be able to look at and say, "My father
[1:06:05] makes no mistakes. The Lord give and the
[1:06:08] Lord took away. Blessed be the name of
[1:06:10] the Lord. I had nothing when I come into
[1:06:13] this world and he saved me. He
[1:06:15] sanctified me. He filled me with the
[1:06:17] Holy Ghost. And if he's letting me go
[1:06:19] through this trial, it will work out for
[1:06:21] the glory of God."
[1:06:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:30] Oh my. Look at this word. To strike with
[1:06:34] the
[1:06:36] fist. Give one a blow.
[1:06:41] Wham with the
[1:06:44] fist. To malt treat, treat with
[1:06:50] violence and
[1:06:53] contempt. And God let a demon
[1:06:57] do this to Paul.
[1:07:02] You imagine after you'd have a great
[1:07:04] revelation from God. I cannot imagine
[1:07:07] what this man went through after he
[1:07:10] wrote the book of Hebrews.
[1:07:14] Poor old guy. But I thought I bet you he
[1:07:17] felt like he was going to
[1:07:19] die because the abundance of the
[1:07:22] revelation just what little bit God
[1:07:24] allows us to go through. You ever been
[1:07:26] that when boy, you just have a great
[1:07:28] time in your life and you reach a great
[1:07:30] crescendo in God and God does some great
[1:07:32] things for you and my goodness on Monday
[1:07:35] morning you have a great service on
[1:07:36] Sunday and Monday morning the car won't
[1:07:39] start the donkey won't break you know
[1:07:41] you ain't got no corn for your chicken
[1:07:42] the hogs is out the cows is out
[1:07:45] everything in the world's going to say
[1:07:46] what in the world what in the world
[1:07:48] happened it was that good service
[1:07:50] yesterday but don't miss church next
[1:07:52] Sunday because the difficulty that's
[1:07:54] going to come on
[1:07:56] But you realize it's part of it. It's
[1:07:59] part of who we are. Divine knowledge
[1:08:01] lets us know that. Believe me as a
[1:08:06] preacher. When you go and God gives you
[1:08:09] meetings or we have wonderful services
[1:08:11] right here, that human element says,
[1:08:14] "Dear
[1:08:16] God, I did it, Lord. Oh, I did it, Lord.
[1:08:19] I did it." Why? to keep Donnie
[1:08:25] smashed down.
[1:08:30] To keep you from being exalted and
[1:08:33] walking around on the streets in Johnson
[1:08:35] City. Look at me. Oh my. I'm the bride.
[1:08:40] That nose of yours stuck up in there. If
[1:08:42] it rained, it drowns you. Amen. If your
[1:08:46] bride, you ought to be so humble and so
[1:08:50] thankful. Instead of walking through the
[1:08:52] mall and looking at every Jezebel there
[1:08:54] and condemning them, you ought to say,
[1:08:56] "God, have mercy on their poor souls.
[1:08:58] They don't realize the darkness that's
[1:09:00] over them."
[1:09:03] Oh
[1:09:04] my. Oh, look at this friends.
[1:09:08] He says, "So I was given a thorn in the
[1:09:10] flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet
[1:09:12] me, lest I should be exalted above
[1:09:16] measure." So watch what happens. The
[1:09:18] revelations that were given to him were
[1:09:21] beyond the measure of his brothers. And
[1:09:24] because they
[1:09:26] are, Satan saw it as an
[1:09:29] opportunity. I'll I'll work on him. I'll
[1:09:34] work on his mind. I'll work on his
[1:09:37] pride, his arrogance, and I'll have him
[1:09:41] to exalt himself
[1:09:44] above his brothers.
[1:09:47] And you see, the higher that we get in
[1:09:49] our own eyes, the smaller our brothers
[1:09:52] look.
[1:09:54] So we climb higher and higher.
[1:09:58] my life, my church, my ministry, my
[1:10:02] people, my my my my.
[1:10:06] And on the ladder, we're ascending.
[1:10:14] I wish somebody would say, "Amen." Amen.
[1:10:18] Oh my. Well, that was pretty weak.
[1:10:26] lest I should be exalted above measure.
[1:10:30] For this thing I
[1:10:32] bought the Lord
[1:10:35] thrice that it might
[1:10:38] depart from me, drift away, to remove,
[1:10:42] to go away, to depart from anyone, to
[1:10:45] desert, withdraw from one. and he said
[1:10:50] unto
[1:10:54] me, "My grace,"
[1:10:58] I love this
[1:10:59] word. I love this word
[1:11:03] grace. Let's let's let's read the
[1:11:05] meaning of it together. Karice is the
[1:11:08] Greek word.
[1:11:10] Favor, that which
[1:11:13] affords joy.
[1:11:17] I wonder how many of us even know the
[1:11:19] meaning of this word. We think it's it's
[1:11:22] something God gives to you when you're
[1:11:23] lost and God saves you and that that's
[1:11:24] it. That's not all of what grace is.
[1:11:27] Grace will help you through your trials.
[1:11:30] Grace will help you through the things
[1:11:32] in life.
[1:11:36] That which affords joy,
[1:11:40] pleasure, delight.
[1:11:44] I need more grace, Lord. Amen. I need
[1:11:47] more grace, Lord.
[1:11:49] Pleasure. Don't you understand how Paul
[1:11:51] could come and say, "Then I
[1:11:54] rejoice in my
[1:11:57] infirmities." How could he do that?
[1:12:01] Grace.
[1:12:03] Paul didn't need grace to be saved. He
[1:12:06] needed grace to endure a gouging thorn.
[1:12:13] Notice this. used of the merciful
[1:12:17] kindness by which God exerting his holy
[1:12:21] influence upon souls
[1:12:24] keeps,
[1:12:25] strengthens, increases them in Christian
[1:12:28] faith, knowledge, affection and kindles
[1:12:33] them to the
[1:12:35] exercise of the
[1:12:38] Christian virtues. Now this come from
[1:12:41] the Strong's concordance not statue of a
[1:12:44] perfect man. But you know what it proves
[1:12:46] to me? Our prophet which couldn't even
[1:12:49] speak Greek and Aramaic but he spoke the
[1:12:52] language of God.
[1:12:55] Hallelujah. And he said unto me, my
[1:12:58] grace is sufficient. I will allocate
[1:13:01] Paul not forgiveness of your sins and
[1:13:04] not to re redeem you. He's already
[1:13:07] redeemed. He's already saved. He's
[1:13:09] already got the Holy Ghost. But what I'm
[1:13:11] going to impart to you is divine grace.
[1:13:15] And coupled with that grace I'm giving
[1:13:17] you now is an element of my knowledge
[1:13:20] about my will for your life. And I'm
[1:13:25] showing you the reason that it must be
[1:13:27] there. It's for your good, Paul. It's
[1:13:31] for your good. You imagine it was very
[1:13:33] hard for him whenever he was trying to
[1:13:36] write. And the prophet tells us, of
[1:13:37] course, it was his eyes. And whenever
[1:13:39] he'd get so bad, brother Dao, and he
[1:13:42] couldn't see, and he would have to write
[1:13:44] in big old letters. But Paul needed
[1:13:47] that. Paul needed that. And God allowed
[1:13:50] it to come. And then God turned around
[1:13:52] and gave him the grace to get through
[1:13:54] it.
[1:13:56] Oh, hallelujah. And he said unto me, "My
[1:13:59] grace is sufficient for thee, for my
[1:14:04] strength is made
[1:14:07] perfect in weakness.
[1:14:15] weakness,
[1:14:18] infirmity,
[1:14:20] disease, want of strength,
[1:14:26] want of strength.
[1:14:30] And capacity
[1:14:32] requisite to bear
[1:14:35] trials and troubles.
[1:14:38] for my strength is made perfect in your
[1:14:43] weakness. Now listen how Paul reacts to
[1:14:45] this. Most gladly therefore will I
[1:14:50] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[1:14:55] power of Christ may rest upon me. Now I
[1:14:59] want you to notice he's not turn around
[1:15:01] and say well that old devil I'll tell
[1:15:03] you one day he does this and he does
[1:15:05] that. that devil. He don't even
[1:15:07] acknowledge how great the devil is. He's
[1:15:10] not saying how powerful the devil is. He
[1:15:13] turns that very thing around and says,
[1:15:16] "I will rejoice." What allowed this to
[1:15:19] happen to him? God with an illumination
[1:15:22] of his divine knowledge, opened up a
[1:15:25] portion of the will of God for Paul's
[1:15:27] life. When the channel was open, God
[1:15:30] ministered grace. He received that grace
[1:15:33] through divine knowledge and it totally
[1:15:36] transformed his testimony. That's why
[1:15:39] some of us have such a negative opposite
[1:15:42] testimony of what we ought to have. I
[1:15:45] don't understand why I'm going through
[1:15:46] this and why I'm going through that.
[1:15:48] Instead of being able to tap into the
[1:15:50] knowledge of God, well, the Lord knows
[1:15:53] exactly what's going on. I've searched
[1:15:55] my life. I don't understand this and
[1:15:57] don't understand that. But it's for a
[1:16:00] reason. Praise be to God. If God wants
[1:16:03] to heal me, he'll heal me. If God wants
[1:16:06] to let me go through this trial, he'll
[1:16:07] let me go through the trial. But either
[1:16:10] way, I'll serve him either way. I wish
[1:16:13] somebody would preach with me this
[1:16:14] morning. Are we going to let our trials
[1:16:16] get us down? Are we going to let our
[1:16:19] troubles get us down? Are we going to
[1:16:21] let our nos when God says absolutely no?
[1:16:25] Are we going to get an attitude against
[1:16:27] God? Not me, brother, sister. I want to
[1:16:30] love him if he answers prayers. And when
[1:16:33] he says no to my prayer, who am I
[1:16:36] anyway? Who are you that God owes us
[1:16:39] anything? Almighty God by his power
[1:16:43] knows what he's doing in our lives.
[1:16:46] [Applause]
[1:16:54] Wow.
[1:16:56] Most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:16:59] glory in my
[1:17:01] infirmities that the power of
[1:17:05] Christ may rest upon
[1:17:10] me. Can you imagine the presence of God
[1:17:15] finds its resting place on the soul of a
[1:17:19] believer when they've submitted to his
[1:17:22] will.
[1:17:25] Don't you want a life that the spirit of
[1:17:28] God can rest? What an awesome word to
[1:17:32] use? The power of God can rest. Can the
[1:17:37] spirit of God rest on us, church? Can we
[1:17:40] be the resting place of the spirit of
[1:17:43] God? That our lives are so submitted to
[1:17:46] his will that the spirit of God is not
[1:17:49] grieved by being around us because of
[1:17:51] our grumbling and our complaining and so
[1:17:53] on and so on.
[1:17:55] Oh,
[1:17:56] hallelujah. The trial Paul must
[1:18:00] endure, but I'll give you grace to go
[1:18:03] through it.
[1:18:05] Paul asked for it to leave him, but
[1:18:07] instead God gave him grace
[1:18:10] to endure it.
[1:18:13] My grace is sufficient for thee. The
[1:18:16] Lord answered his prayer, but not in the
[1:18:20] way he thought.
[1:18:21] And no doubt he'd be like the rest of us
[1:18:23] cuz he was a very honest man. He said,
[1:18:25] "Well, it wasn't exactly what I wanted,
[1:18:27] but God knows exactly what I need." He
[1:18:30] doesn't supply. He does not tell us in
[1:18:32] his word, I'll supply all your wants.
[1:18:35] But he does say, I will meet all your
[1:18:38] needs. And most of us Leodyans have got
[1:18:41] way more wants than we do needs. When it
[1:18:44] comes right down to it, we could survive
[1:18:46] with a whole lot less than what we've
[1:18:47] got. And the church said, "Oh, but our
[1:18:51] father will absolutely provide
[1:18:53] everything we have need of." That's
[1:18:55] right. Amen. Oh, by giving him grace, it
[1:19:00] deposited an assurance through the
[1:19:02] channel of divine knowledge.
[1:19:06] Oh. Oh,
[1:19:08] okay. You imagine the devil had been
[1:19:11] said, "Oh, you're you're a prophet. Look
[1:19:13] at you. You're this and that and the
[1:19:14] other and God won't even remove this."
[1:19:16] You imagine when God dropped that to him
[1:19:18] and said, "Hey, devil, did you hear
[1:19:20] that? Back off. Back off. You told me he
[1:19:23] didn't love me. This proves to me how
[1:19:25] much he does love me because he knows I
[1:19:28] am my greatest enemy. And if he don't
[1:19:31] allow this to happen while I'm in this
[1:19:33] type of a body, I could become proud. I
[1:19:37] could become arrogant. It could be to my
[1:19:39] demise. That experience could destroy
[1:19:42] me.
[1:19:47] Amen.
[1:19:50] I don't mind telling you
[1:19:52] friends. I want everything that God has
[1:19:55] for me,
[1:19:58] but I never have. And I am not going to
[1:20:00] start
[1:20:01] today asking God for all kinds of
[1:20:04] supernatural this and supernatural that
[1:20:07] and gifts and this and that and the
[1:20:09] other.
[1:20:12] Because God can't trust everybody with
[1:20:14] them.
[1:20:16] And if I'm one of them type of people,
[1:20:18] so be it. God will never let it come by
[1:20:20] my way.
[1:20:22] Amen. Amen. You feel the same way?
[1:20:26] Listen to what you can do with the gift.
[1:20:32] God's prophet said, "Now I
[1:20:34] realize that a man can take a divine
[1:20:38] gift and send his soul to
[1:20:42] hell with
[1:20:45] it. I'm talking about drinking, smoking,
[1:20:48] adultery, lying, fornication.
[1:20:53] But a man can take a divine
[1:20:56] gift and send his soul, him, the
[1:21:00] man send his own soul to hell with what?
[1:21:07] A divine gift.
[1:21:13] So Lord, if I can't handle them, don't
[1:21:15] send them my way.
[1:21:18] And I'm going to say the same thing for
[1:21:19] you. Lord, if you can't handle it, you
[1:21:21] can't. You can't. You can't. Please
[1:21:23] don't send it to Brother Aaron if he
[1:21:24] can't handle it. Lord, please don't send
[1:21:26] it to Brother Skip if he can't handle
[1:21:28] it. Please don't send it to our sisters
[1:21:30] if it would damn their soul to hell.
[1:21:35] Amen.
[1:21:40] I'll give y'all a few minutes to
[1:21:41] recuperate. Them quotes kind of do that
[1:21:43] to us, don't they? They make your knees
[1:21:45] kind of tremble and
[1:21:50] Listen to this. A man can take a divine
[1:21:52] gift and send his soul to hell. You know
[1:21:56] that a gift from
[1:21:59] God. I don't mean just something that
[1:22:02] you imagine. I mean, if
[1:22:06] God has really given
[1:22:10] something and give it to your
[1:22:15] charge, you've got to use
[1:22:18] that with the wisdom of God.
[1:22:22] See why we need the virtues?
[1:22:25] But if we're not careful, we want the
[1:22:26] gifts first and we don't know how to use
[1:22:29] them. We don't know what to do with
[1:22:30] them.
[1:22:32] Amen.
[1:22:35] It's going on in our ranks, friends.
[1:22:39] People are telling people things in the
[1:22:41] name of the Lord.
[1:22:43] You've got this on you. You've got that
[1:22:45] on you. You've got that on you.
[1:22:48] Sending people in terrible states.
[1:22:55] heard of an individual
[1:22:58] sister and a preacher told her a certain
[1:23:03] thing which was not
[1:23:07] true. Her mother and father had to take
[1:23:09] her and put her in an insane
[1:23:11] institution.
[1:23:16] Remember the video that we have of
[1:23:18] brother Brandham and a woman comes up
[1:23:21] And he tells her, "The people have told
[1:23:24] you you've got a spirit of a witch on
[1:23:25] you. Remember that?" She cries and
[1:23:27] carries on.
[1:23:32] Look how dangerous it can be. Oh, God
[1:23:36] help us.
[1:23:39] Remember the prophet going to brother
[1:23:40] Neville,
[1:23:42] and the spirit of God woke him up and
[1:23:44] told him 3:00 in the morning, something
[1:23:46] like that, and said, "Go tell brother
[1:23:48] Neville." Right?
[1:23:51] I find that
[1:23:53] instance interesting
[1:23:56] because brother Random is not the type
[1:23:57] of individual that would publicly want
[1:23:59] to embarrass people. So he goes to
[1:24:02] brother Neville privately tells brother
[1:24:04] Neville about that and he said the
[1:24:06] reason was because the people was
[1:24:08] pulling on brother Neville and he would
[1:24:11] go to telling them things that was not
[1:24:12] right.
[1:24:15] No doubt brother Neville repented and
[1:24:17] made it right before God.
[1:24:20] Why would brother Brandham then publicly
[1:24:22] mention that situation
[1:24:25] when that man had no doubt made it right
[1:24:27] before the Lord and that was brother
[1:24:30] Neville sitting right behind brother
[1:24:31] Brandham question answer 64 when brother
[1:24:34] Brandham tells it and you can hear
[1:24:36] brother Neville amen
[1:24:39] that's a real son of God right there
[1:24:43] remember Christ spirit oh hallelujah
[1:24:46] Christ's gifts are subject to Christ
[1:24:49] teaching. Christ spirit is subject to
[1:24:53] Christ's teaching.
[1:24:56] And the church said, "Why in the world
[1:24:59] would brother Brandham feel the need to
[1:25:03] publicly let thousands and thousands of
[1:25:07] people in the years to come hear of this
[1:25:10] thing that Brother Neville did after he
[1:25:13] had made it right before God.
[1:25:22] No doubt we needed to hear it.
[1:25:27] Now you imagine, brother Neville hair,
[1:25:28] if it been if it been mean you and you
[1:25:31] you was prophesying and saying stuff and
[1:25:33] I'd come to you and just say, "Brother
[1:25:34] Donnie, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
[1:25:36] Please forgive me." And then I get up
[1:25:37] next Sunday saying, "I'll tell you one
[1:25:39] thing. I had to go to Harry and tell him
[1:25:40] I say, Lord have mercy. Lord, I if he do
[1:25:44] his own brother that way, what would he
[1:25:46] do me? Same way.
[1:25:49] So, no doubt brother Brandham was not a
[1:25:51] vindictive. You understand friends what
[1:25:53] I'm saying? He was not a vindictive type
[1:25:56] of guy. He must have
[1:25:58] known. We would need to hear that.
[1:26:06] Why?
[1:26:10] Why? Because people can go to telling
[1:26:13] somebody, you've got this on you and
[1:26:14] you've got that on you and you've got
[1:26:16] this.
[1:26:18] As a preacher called out my wife years
[1:26:20] ago on Pentecost, told her she's called
[1:26:23] to preach.
[1:26:27] Now, she did a good job preaching to her
[1:26:30] congregation, Alicia Erica.
[1:26:34] Another preacher called her out and told
[1:26:35] her she had cancer.
[1:26:39] Listen to me, children.
[1:26:42] Demons can get in the mouths of
[1:26:45] preachers
[1:26:47] and try to get you to accept something
[1:26:50] that you don't even have.
[1:26:54] They can get in the mouth of your
[1:26:56] doctor, too. They can get in the mouth
[1:26:58] of your PA or whatever more and say,
[1:27:01] "You've got this and you've got that.
[1:27:03] Don't you sign for that thing." Words
[1:27:06] have power in
[1:27:08] them. Oh my. How many people have been
[1:27:12] thrown through terrible trauma in their
[1:27:14] life because a preacher said, "You've
[1:27:17] got this, you've got that." And they
[1:27:19] knew within their heart they did not
[1:27:21] have it. But if they're not careful,
[1:27:23] their confidence in that preacher will
[1:27:26] make them accept it.
[1:27:36] No, no, no, no, sir. No, no.
[1:27:40] If I don't have the
[1:27:42] ability to deal with the
[1:27:45] gift, keep them away from me.
[1:27:53] Come on, children.
[1:27:56] Why is it that we deem those who
[1:27:57] supposedly have gifts are much more
[1:27:59] spiritual than those who don't? Oh,
[1:28:05] you have to deal with some of the
[1:28:06] cleanup that I have to deal with over
[1:28:08] this trash, you'd understand why I'm
[1:28:11] saying what I'm saying this morning.
[1:28:15] Notice God can't trust his gifts with
[1:28:17] everybody. Do you believe that? When God
[1:28:20] gives you a gift, you have to watch what
[1:28:22] you're doing with it. Do you believe
[1:28:24] that? Apparently, he wanted us to
[1:28:27] believe that, didn't he? Amen.
[1:28:29] Did you know a man could take a gift of
[1:28:34] God and send his
[1:28:38] soul to hell with
[1:28:43] it? Brother Donnie, that scares me to
[1:28:45] death. I don't even want no
[1:28:48] gifts. Well, what we need to do is say,
[1:28:50] Lord, if you ordained me to have them,
[1:28:53] let me have them. If you didn't, keep
[1:28:55] them away from me. Amen.
[1:28:59] I only want to be what God wants me to
[1:29:01] be and ordained me to be. I know I'll
[1:29:03] never be much. I'll never amount to
[1:29:05] much. I'll never accomplish much. I
[1:29:07] don't know that already. And you know
[1:29:09] what? I'm good with that.
[1:29:12] If I just live this little teeny tiny
[1:29:14] life and I'm a little bitty tiny ant and
[1:29:17] I'm just going around in the message
[1:29:19] like this and I'm just scuttering over
[1:29:21] here and over there and there's great
[1:29:22] big giants all around me ever giant
[1:29:25] preachers, you know, giant believers in
[1:29:26] the message and I'm just this little ant
[1:29:28] and I'm just going, "Hallelujah. Glory
[1:29:30] to God. Thank you Jesus. Thank you
[1:29:32] Jesus." But remember, King Solomon took
[1:29:34] a text on the ant. So don't leave me out
[1:29:36] of the mound. I may not be a big giant
[1:29:39] with big footprints about that on,
[1:29:46] but if God ordained me to be an ant, I'm
[1:29:48] going to be a busy little fella. If God
[1:29:51] ordained me, hallelujah, to be out of
[1:29:53] the limelight, praise be to God. I just
[1:29:57] want to please him with all of my soul.
[1:29:59] Anybody else feel that way you're this
[1:30:01] morning? I don't have to be big. I don't
[1:30:04] have to be important, but what I have to
[1:30:07] be is pleasing to God.
[1:30:11] [Applause]
[1:30:20] You'll watch on the platform and you
[1:30:22] seldom hear me say something
[1:30:25] about, "I cast out this devil."
[1:30:32] I have to see
[1:30:35] first. If it's the will of God to do
[1:30:38] that,
[1:30:40] I've seen it, Brother John, in prayer
[1:30:42] lines, many young
[1:30:44] preachers, people will come through and
[1:30:46] man, you devil, I'll tell you, I think,
[1:30:50] yeah, you better be careful, buddy.
[1:30:54] If that person's got a sin in their life
[1:30:56] and God allowed that thing to be there
[1:30:58] and you by your authority, if you have
[1:31:00] any by your authority make it leave, do
[1:31:02] you understand God makes you answer for
[1:31:04] it? Yes, sir.
[1:31:06] Sometimes when y'all come up for prayer
[1:31:07] and you'll notice that I delay and I
[1:31:12] wait or you're listening to my prayer,
[1:31:14] which I know you do, and you see where
[1:31:17] I'm going. You say, "Well, he did. He
[1:31:18] didn't say this. He didn't say that."
[1:31:20] I'm waiting from for direction from
[1:31:23] father.
[1:31:25] I got enough to deal with the way it is.
[1:31:27] I sort of want to stand before God and
[1:31:30] have to answer for that.
[1:31:33] Oh my goodness. What am I talking about
[1:31:36] this morning? Divine knowledge. That's
[1:31:38] right. Amen. Now, of course, we'd rather
[1:31:40] have gifts.
[1:31:43] Let's preach about the gifts. Let's talk
[1:31:44] about the gifts. Let's talk about divine
[1:31:46] knowledge. how to use the gifts and then
[1:31:48] maybe the Lord will pour them out among
[1:31:50] us. It's evident, friends, a message
[1:31:52] people ain't got enough sense to know
[1:31:54] how to use a lot of them.
[1:31:59] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:32:01] Notice again, let every word be
[1:32:03] established in the mouth of two, three
[1:32:04] witnesses.
[1:32:06] The prophet talking about casting out a
[1:32:08] devil. You seldom hear me say something
[1:32:10] about I cast out this devil. All right.
[1:32:12] To see first whether it's the will of
[1:32:14] God or not to do that first. I pray for
[1:32:16] the person but never call over that
[1:32:22] demon. You mean to tell me that he would
[1:32:25] just ask a prayer of blessing but
[1:32:28] without a release from God he would not
[1:32:31] charge that devil to leave.
[1:32:35] He had authority to do it. But he had
[1:32:38] divine knowledge from God on certain
[1:32:42] instances. You leave that alone.
[1:32:45] Don't rebuke that.
[1:32:50] Can I go on a few more minutes?
[1:32:55] There must have been a disconnect there.
[1:32:56] Uh, can I go on a few more minutes?
[1:33:03] Do you realize that a gift of that type,
[1:33:06] now listen, this is a continuation of
[1:33:08] the same sermon there. Do you realize a
[1:33:12] gift of that
[1:33:14] type could send your
[1:33:16] soul to
[1:33:19] hell? Now, I guess I'm wondering why
[1:33:21] that we don't hear message preachers
[1:33:24] preach these
[1:33:27] quotes or is this a part of the message
[1:33:29] that we actually don't really believe?
[1:33:31] Oh my. Because as we go on in time, it's
[1:33:35] evident some of the preachers standing
[1:33:37] behind pulpit saying they are preaching
[1:33:38] the message are dissecting, cutting,
[1:33:41] splicing, taking what they want.
[1:33:47] That ain't going to happen in this
[1:33:48] church as long as I'm in my right mind.
[1:33:57] And I hope if I get out of my right
[1:33:59] mind, y'all vote me out and get somebody
[1:34:00] that's in the right
[1:34:02] mind. Who do you figure knew more about
[1:34:05] how to operate in that supernatural
[1:34:07] realm? A prophet of God that had dealt
[1:34:09] there for years
[1:34:12] or somebody like me or somebody like
[1:34:15] brother Daryl or somebody like brother
[1:34:16] John who's well. Oh, sure. We've had
[1:34:19] great experience with the Lord. Nothing
[1:34:20] like what this prophet dealt with.
[1:34:23] nothing. There's not a man on the earth
[1:34:26] and never will there be that will ever
[1:34:29] walk even close to where he walked.
[1:34:33] I'm going to take his opinion over my
[1:34:36] own,
[1:34:38] much less yours.
[1:34:41] Opinions are like noses. Everybody's got
[1:34:44] one. But we're not running this church
[1:34:47] according to your nose or your opinion.
[1:34:50] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:34:55] Praise the
[1:34:56] Lord. Notice again he says, "How many
[1:34:59] knows that you could send your soul to
[1:35:04] hell with a divine
[1:35:07] gift?" Sure
[1:35:09] can. You have to
[1:35:12] watch what you're doing.
[1:35:16] Now you imagine if brother Neville would
[1:35:18] have continued on and prophesied over
[1:35:20] people until this one this and this one
[1:35:21] that there was nothing but the flesh or
[1:35:25] an
[1:35:26] impression. Uh you've got a spirit of
[1:35:28] hate on you and you've got this on you
[1:35:30] and you and you're sitting there
[1:35:31] thinking that's not my battle. I don't I
[1:35:34] don't hate nobody. I that's not true.
[1:35:37] Then you go out and say that's a servant
[1:35:38] of God. That's a man of God. What what
[1:35:40] in the
[1:35:42] world? And I put you through months and
[1:35:45] months of
[1:35:47] trials because of an impression of an
[1:35:51] evil
[1:35:56] spirit. Proverbs 16:18 says it this
[1:36:01] way, "Pride goeth before
[1:36:05] destruction and a hotty
[1:36:08] spirit before a fall."
[1:36:12] Oh, that's Old Testament, Brother
[1:36:13] Donnie. Well, let's read it from the New
[1:36:15] 1 Timothy 3:5. Paul talking about
[1:36:17] getting a pastor of a
[1:36:19] church. If a man know not how to rule
[1:36:22] his own house, how shall he take care of
[1:36:23] the church of God? Amen. Not a
[1:36:26] novice. Talking about getting a pastor.
[1:36:28] Not a novice.
[1:36:32] It's amazing to me, friends, how dumb,
[1:36:35] how spiritually dumb some message people
[1:36:38] are that would put noviceses to lead
[1:36:42] their churches.
[1:36:44] You got to be kidding. They will walk
[1:36:45] away from a mature servant of God and
[1:36:48] some upstart that ain't even got enough
[1:36:50] sense to know how to set the church in
[1:36:51] order. And they will leave a church
[1:36:54] that's established under the presence of
[1:36:56] God and set under a
[1:36:58] novice. Of
[1:37:03] course, the thing of it is a lot of them
[1:37:04] wants positions
[1:37:06] and a lot of these politicians in the
[1:37:08] message will give you a position.
[1:37:12] My business education teacher whenever I
[1:37:14] went to school, I won't mention her
[1:37:17] name. She's probably dead now anyway.
[1:37:18] But anyway, I was her
[1:37:21] pick. I didn't want to be. I never asked
[1:37:24] to be, but she wanted me to be. And she
[1:37:27] said, "I want you to run for president."
[1:37:28] And I said, "I don't want to be
[1:37:30] president." She said, "Well, I want you
[1:37:32] to be vice president." I said, "I don't
[1:37:34] want to be vice president." So, they
[1:37:36] voted. The class voted. Yeah. They voted
[1:37:38] for this, voted for that. I seen this
[1:37:40] look come over her face, wore glasses,
[1:37:41] short, about that big, about that big
[1:37:43] around. Sat there and I seen her look at
[1:37:44] me and she had that look on her face. I
[1:37:46] thought, "Uh-oh, I'm in
[1:37:48] trouble." So, after the vote was over,
[1:37:50] she come up and said,
[1:37:52] "Donnie, I went up to her desk." She
[1:37:54] said, I said, "Yes, ma'am." He said, "I
[1:37:57] am appointing you to be second vice
[1:38:02] president." There was no second vice
[1:38:05] president, but she wanted me to be in a
[1:38:08] position so bad. Let me tell you
[1:38:09] something. Word of life. I'm not here to
[1:38:11] offer 13 deacon ships and 14 trustee
[1:38:15] ships and associate to the associate to
[1:38:17] the associate of the paper picker upper
[1:38:20] on the parking lot. I'm not here to
[1:38:22] offer you a position in the body, but I
[1:38:25] am here to tell you that you can find a
[1:38:29] position in Christ Jesus, full of the
[1:38:33] Holy Ghost, and escape the hell that's
[1:38:36] fixing to come on this earth.
[1:38:49] Let's
[1:38:49] stand if you can get up.
[1:38:56] Oh
[1:39:01] my I don't have any more trips overseas
[1:39:04] planned. Y'all want me to see if I can
[1:39:05] schedule
[1:39:07] something? I received invitations from
[1:39:09] Poland, from Rome, from Venice, from uh
[1:39:13] all over everywhere. Latvia while I was
[1:39:15] gone. I told Carol said, "Church ain't
[1:39:18] going to like
[1:39:20] that." After preaching like this, I
[1:39:22] might have been
[1:39:26] wrong. But the thing of it is those
[1:39:29] people that I saw there in those
[1:39:32] meetings, they're streaming you right
[1:39:35] now.
[1:39:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:41] Because people all over the world are
[1:39:44] wanting to be told the truth.
[1:39:56] But the Bible says in the last days
[1:39:59] they'll have itching ears.
[1:40:02] And that's what a lot of them want, a
[1:40:04] preacher that'll scratch their itch.
[1:40:08] If I can ever figure out how to take
[1:40:09] this sword and scratch your itch, I'll
[1:40:12] do my
[1:40:13] best. I've never figured out how to
[1:40:16] scratch an itch with a
[1:40:20] sword. I'm not here to scratch your
[1:40:24] itch. You may dislike me now, and I
[1:40:27] might make you angry sometimes. That
[1:40:30] breaks my heart.
[1:40:31] Cuz you know, I've told you before, as a
[1:40:34] child, I didn't have no friends. Hardly.
[1:40:37] I had a flashback the other day when I
[1:40:39] was in
[1:40:40] Switzerland. I met so many friends
[1:40:44] there. It just done something to
[1:40:47] me. But I was laying there one morning.
[1:40:49] Carol hadn't woke up yet, and I was just
[1:40:51] laying there thinking,
[1:40:54] God, you've been so kind to me. And I
[1:40:58] went back to the second
[1:41:01] grade sitting on the playground of the
[1:41:06] Wayne County Elementary
[1:41:09] School. My clothes were
[1:41:11] ragged. People laughed at us because we
[1:41:14] were
[1:41:15] poor. Nobody ever want to play with me.
[1:41:19] I never had no
[1:41:21] friends. Nobody ever liked
[1:41:23] me. When I got older, become a
[1:41:27] teenager, some guys said they wanted to
[1:41:30] be my friends, which I never did
[1:41:31] understand
[1:41:33] why. But my friends, so-called were the
[1:41:36] ones who brought Playboy magazines to
[1:41:39] school. And they would knock me down on
[1:41:41] the floor. And I'd put my hands over my
[1:41:44] eyes like this. And one of them would
[1:41:46] set a straddle on my chest, and one pull
[1:41:48] this arm down, that arm down, and then
[1:41:50] two more would get up here like this,
[1:41:52] and pull my eyes this way.
[1:41:57] And that were my friends.
[1:42:02] And I laid there and I thought, Lord,
[1:42:05] you've been so good to
[1:42:07] me. I got so many
[1:42:11] friends and I'm
[1:42:15] grateful. But I want people to be a
[1:42:18] friend to me. Not because what they can
[1:42:20] get out of me,
[1:42:23] but because they love the truth of God's
[1:42:25] word.
[1:42:27] Right?
[1:42:29] So, it's been
[1:42:37] hard. So, because of that, whenever I've
[1:42:41] had friends, I don't want to lose them.
[1:42:44] I want to hold on to them. And there's a
[1:42:46] I have to be honest, there's a fear in
[1:42:49] me that my friends will one day I'll go
[1:42:55] away and I won't be a a second grader on
[1:42:59] the parking lot, but I'll be a an old
[1:43:03] preacher in the message parking
[1:43:07] lot. It ain't been that many years ago
[1:43:10] that I stood there. Hardly a preacher
[1:43:13] would call me. Nobody wanted any
[1:43:15] meetings. Nobody wanted me to come for
[1:43:17] any conventions because they thought I
[1:43:19] was nuts for what I was
[1:43:21] preaching. And here I stand.
[1:43:29] Humanly, I'd rather just come together
[1:43:31] and just preach something and just make
[1:43:33] us all be happy and praise the Lord. Oh
[1:43:36] my, let's just all smile.
[1:43:39] But in my soul,
[1:43:43] I've got to tell the truth.
[1:43:49] And that's the kind of men that we want
[1:43:50] behind this pull pit, too. Vistant
[1:43:53] preachers, local brothers here. That's
[1:43:55] the kind of men we want that'll preach
[1:43:57] the truth with the love of God in their
[1:44:01] hearts.
[1:44:02] I believe this is what it's going to be
[1:44:05] that's going to change us. That's right.
[1:44:08] We want to be changed. Amen.
[1:44:12] Let's bury it
[1:44:20] together. Heavenly Father, as we stand
[1:44:23] here
[1:44:24] today in this presence, I know these
[1:44:28] things are kind of frightening. I know.
[1:44:31] I I I feel that, too. I feel that.
[1:44:35] Lord God, I I
[1:44:37] pray that in one way we never get away
[1:44:39] from that awesome
[1:44:43] respect. It's evident that some people
[1:44:45] in the message have got away from the
[1:44:48] fear of
[1:44:49] God. It's evident some of our
[1:44:53] preachers have got away from the fear of
[1:44:56] tampering with the prophet's
[1:44:59] words. As I've been looking and reading
[1:45:03] some and the transition from the prophet
[1:45:05] Samuel to King
[1:45:09] Saul and Israel came to a
[1:45:13] change. It looks like Lord that's sort
[1:45:16] of the direction that we've been for a
[1:45:18] while.
[1:45:19] So this king
[1:45:22] slashpastor, this king slash
[1:45:25] evangelist, this king
[1:45:30] slashteer, they sort through what they
[1:45:32] want that our prophet said. And if they
[1:45:34] don't think it applies to this day, then
[1:45:36] they just don't believe
[1:45:38] it. Well, we're going to run our church
[1:45:40] this way because William Brandon ain't
[1:45:41] the pastor of our church.
[1:45:45] So, we got a little kingdom over here, a
[1:45:47] little kingdom over there, another
[1:45:48] little kingdom over here. Lord Jesus, we
[1:45:51] don't want no kingdom here. Only kingdom
[1:45:54] we want is the kingdom of
[1:45:58] God. God forbid that we would ever build
[1:46:02] a Reagan
[1:46:04] kingdom. How how how
[1:46:07] ungodly, how
[1:46:09] horrible that we'd want to build a
[1:46:11] kingdom and attach a man's name to it.
[1:46:15] There's only one great one among us and
[1:46:17] that's you, the Lord
[1:46:19] Jesus. The one who died for
[1:46:22] us. Help us,
[1:46:25] Father. Lord, I want to be what you want
[1:46:27] me to
[1:46:29] be. I pray if you cannot trust me with
[1:46:32] very much I never want to seek beyond
[1:46:37] that because I
[1:46:39] realize the prophet told us about 40-day
[1:46:43] fasts in demonology and mentioned it in
[1:46:46] a few places and he called it enticing
[1:46:52] spirits which seems peculiar and
[1:46:55] odd but we understand when people go on
[1:46:59] a
[1:47:01] quest for a supernatural
[1:47:04] realm. Not only is God
[1:47:07] there, but so is the devil.
[1:47:11] So Lord, we want to judge our
[1:47:13] supernatural experiences by your
[1:47:17] word. We want to be a supernatural
[1:47:20] church. We long to see them apostolic
[1:47:23] times moving among us. And the prophet
[1:47:25] saying it perfect faith said, "We see
[1:47:27] them, but we want to see more of them.
[1:47:30] And we do too,
[1:47:32] Lord. But we do want to make sure it's
[1:47:34] you that we're
[1:47:37] experiencing and not evil
[1:47:39] spirits." Because a prophet tells us
[1:47:41] when people would prophesy or speak in
[1:47:43] tongues and they would interpret and it
[1:47:46] did not come to pass. And he said, "You
[1:47:49] pray and get that evil spirit off of
[1:47:53] you." So an evil spirit could make a
[1:47:56] person speak in tongues or interpret or
[1:47:59] prophesy or call somebody out and tell
[1:48:01] them something that was not the
[1:48:03] truth because you do not lie.
[1:48:10] Help us, Lord
[1:48:12] Jesus. Help us. Thank you. Father God,
[1:48:16] place in my hands what you can trust me
[1:48:20] with. Place in the hands of my
[1:48:23] sheep what you can trust us with. Give
[1:48:25] us the wisdom, the knowledge of God to
[1:48:28] operate what you've given us and the
[1:48:31] knowledge of God not to ask for more
[1:48:34] than what you've ordained us to have.
[1:48:36] Because then we come into demonic
[1:48:39] realms, which I'm afraid some of the
[1:48:42] folks around this message have entered
[1:48:45] into, and they're so hungry and so
[1:48:48] thirsting for more supernatural this,
[1:48:51] supernatural that, and the flesh goes to
[1:48:55] getting in the
[1:48:57] way. Help us,
[1:49:01] Lord. Come, Lord Jesus.
[1:49:06] Come Lord
[1:49:08] Jesus. Sing the song for us Harry that
[1:49:11] you sang as we went into the
[1:49:14] word. Let's sing this together now and
[1:49:17] let's just meditate on the
[1:49:19] words. It's my
[1:49:22] desire. It's my
[1:49:24] desire to be what he wants me to be. And
[1:49:28] we know many many times what he wants us
[1:49:31] to be is never what we think we should
[1:49:33] be oursel. And we think we've got so
[1:49:35] much capacity and so much to do this and
[1:49:38] that with. But if he only allocates that
[1:49:41] much to me, I figure he knows more about
[1:49:43] it than I do. I may figure I'm this sort
[1:49:46] of a big guy, but if he only gives me
[1:49:48] that much or that
[1:49:51] much. He knows more about what I would
[1:49:53] do with it. You agree with that? Amen.
[1:49:56] Can we search our hearts here this
[1:49:58] morning? Lord, I want what you want for
[1:50:01] me. It's my desire to be like you. Let's
[1:50:06] sing it together as we worship. It's my
[1:50:09] desire.
[1:50:12] Think about what you're saying now. To
[1:50:16] live for Jesus.
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:22] is
[1:50:23] my desire
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:29] to
[1:50:30] be like him. I want nothing, Lord.
[1:50:37] I don't want no gifts that he's supposed
[1:50:38] to be like. I f I don't want to say
[1:50:42] things in your
[1:50:45] hand
[1:50:49] sh. It's my
[1:50:55] desire to children of all to live for
[1:51:00] him.
[1:51:01] [Music]
[1:51:04] Oh, if you can
[1:51:08] see where Jesus
[1:51:11] brought me from to where I am
[1:51:18] today, then you would know the
[1:51:23] reason
[1:51:25] why I love him
[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:33] Go. You can take the world's wealth and
[1:51:39] all its
[1:51:42] riches. I don't need the
[1:51:46] fame. It's my
[1:51:52] desire.
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:51:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:52:00] Hallelujah. It's
[1:52:02] my
[1:52:05] desire to help someone. To
[1:52:09] help
[1:52:11] someone
[1:52:14] today,
[1:52:15] someone who
[1:52:17] may have
[1:52:21] failed to
[1:52:23] see the way.
[1:52:26] Oh yes,
[1:52:29] Lord. I too once was
[1:52:34] lost. Oh, but he draw me by his grace to
[1:52:40] the cross. Oh, it's
[1:52:44] my
[1:52:48] desire. I want to live for him.
[1:52:54] Everybody now.
[1:52:57] Oh, if you could
[1:53:01] see where Jesus brought me
[1:53:05] from to where I am
[1:53:11] today. You would know the
[1:53:16] reason why I love him.
[1:53:22] [Laughter]
[1:53:24] soul. Now you can take this world, it's
[1:53:31] wealth and
[1:53:34] riches. I don't need her
[1:53:39] fame. It's my
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:45] desire to live for him.
[1:53:51] [Applause]
[1:53:53] If you could
[1:53:57] see where Jesus brought me
[1:54:01] from to where I
[1:54:05] am today.
[1:54:08] He would know the
[1:54:12] reason
[1:54:14] why I love him.
[1:54:21] So you can take this world its wealth
[1:54:29] and
[1:54:31] riches. I don't need a fame.
[1:54:36] is my
[1:54:41] desire to
[1:54:43] live for
[1:54:48] him. It's my
[1:54:55] desire to help
[1:54:59] someone today.
[1:55:04] Someone who
[1:55:06] may have
[1:55:09] failed to
[1:55:12] see the
[1:55:17] way for
[1:55:19] I on was
[1:55:23] alone but you brought me back to my God.
[1:55:31] It's my
[1:55:35] desire, my Lord, to
[1:55:40] live for him.
[1:55:45] If you could
[1:55:48] see where Jesus
[1:55:51] brought me from to where I am
[1:55:58] today, then
[1:56:00] you would
[1:56:03] know the reason why I love him.
[1:56:12] So now you can take this world, its
[1:56:19] wealth and its
[1:56:22] riches. I don't
[1:56:25] want
[1:56:26] fame. It's
[1:56:28] my
[1:56:33] desire to live for him.
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:41] If you could
[1:56:44] see where Jesus brought me from to where
[1:56:51] I
[1:56:52] am
[1:56:54] today, then you would
[1:56:58] know the reason why I
[1:57:03] love him
[1:57:08] So now you can
[1:57:11] take the
[1:57:13] world is wealth that
[1:57:18] resists. I don't
[1:57:20] need
[1:57:22] fame. It's my
[1:57:28] desire to
[1:57:30] live for him.
[1:57:35] [Applause]
[1:57:37] If you could
[1:57:40] see where Jesus
[1:57:43] brought me from and where I am
[1:57:49] today, then
[1:57:51] you will
[1:57:53] know the
[1:57:55] reason why I love him
[1:58:03] So now you can take this
[1:58:09] world, this wealth that
[1:58:13] riches. I don't
[1:58:15] need a
[1:58:17] thing. It's my

[1:58:26] live for him.
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:32] It's my
[1:58:37] desire to
[1:58:40] live for
[1:58:49] him. Thank
[1:58:54] you.

[2:13:14] [Music]
[2:13:22] I'm not sure what in the world this big
[2:13:25] guy's doing up here to baptize. He don't
[2:13:27] ever show up and not baptize anybody
[2:13:30] else. Of course, it could be that's
[2:13:33] something he's feeling inside of his
[2:13:35] heart. Something squeezing his heart
[2:13:38] causing them tears come out of his eyes.
[2:13:42] What greater thing for our children, our
[2:13:45] grandchildren that we can have for them
[2:13:48] to be able to walk in the truth of the
[2:13:50] gospel.
[2:13:52] A great honor, isn't it? Let's just pray
[2:13:54] together.
[2:13:57] Heavenly Father, as Emma comes today to
[2:14:01] take on your name, we know to a lot of
[2:14:04] people maybe baptism would seem odd and
[2:14:06] peculiar, but we've been taught that
[2:14:09] it's like a grave, a watery
[2:14:12] grave. So, we go down one person and we
[2:14:16] come up another one. Oh, yes. Showing
[2:14:19] that you're dealing with her heart. As I
[2:14:21] spoke to her back there before we came
[2:14:22] out, tears coming out of her eyes. Lord
[2:14:26] Jesus, we thank you for that. It's a
[2:14:28] great treasure for the presence of God
[2:14:30] to deal with the human heart. I can
[2:14:33] baptize her today in water, but Lord,
[2:14:36] only you can fill her with the Holy
[2:14:37] Ghost. And I asked her if she understood
[2:14:40] that prescription, and she nodded her
[2:14:42] head yes. It's simple. It started being
[2:14:45] filled there that day on the day of
[2:14:47] Pentecost. How many people have come up?
[2:14:50] Hallelujah. To be filled with the same
[2:14:53] prescription, repent and be baptized,
[2:14:55] every one of you, in the name of Jesus
[2:14:57] Christ, and you shall receive the gift
[2:14:59] of the Holy Ghost. Lord God, I pray that
[2:15:02] you' just take her life, Lord. Mold her
[2:15:04] and shape her into something that'll be
[2:15:07] pleasing to you. Lord, grant it, Father,
[2:15:09] in the name of
[2:15:13] Jesus. Lord, just put this over your
[2:15:15] nose and mouth so we don't come out.
[2:15:17] Okay.
[2:15:19] Emma, I baptize you today in the name of
[2:15:22] the Lord Jesus
[2:15:37] Christ.
[2:15:40] Amen. Praise the Lord this morning. Did
[2:15:42] you enjoy the service this morning?
[2:15:44] Amen. And I don't know if the words of
[2:15:45] this song are in the computer or not,
[2:15:46] but let's sing this little course as
[2:15:48] you're dismissed this morning. I have
[2:15:50] been blessed. God's so good to
[2:15:53] me. Oh, I have been
[2:15:56] blessed. God's so good to
[2:16:00] me. Precious are his thoughts of you and
[2:16:07] me. No way I could count them. There's
[2:16:11] not enough
[2:16:13] time. So, I'll just thank him for being
[2:16:19] so

[2:16:24] good. So
[2:16:27] good. I have

[2:17:40] kind. God has been
