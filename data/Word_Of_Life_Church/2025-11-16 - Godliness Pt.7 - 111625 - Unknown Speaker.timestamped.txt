[25:10] I fall to my knees and breathe [singing]
[25:15] in.
[25:18] Breathe [singing]
[25:19] in.
[25:22] Breathe
[25:23] in
[25:26] your [singing and music] peace.
[25:32] [music]
[25:33] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[25:55] &gt;&gt; How many's glad you're a sign of the
[25:56] cross and that Calvary was a success?
[26:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[26:20] &gt;&gt; If you would have known me way back
[26:23] [music and singing] then and how I used
[26:25] to live,
[26:28] [music] it would be easy to See, it was
[26:31] all about me. I [singing] had nothing to
[26:34] do.
[26:36] But I [music] remember the day [singing]
[26:39] I found grace and a hole in my heart was
[26:43] filled. Now [music] I'm a [singing]
[26:46] brand new man because of nail pierced
[26:49] hands hanging on Calvar's [music]
[26:52] hill.
[26:54] I'm just a sign of the cross.
[27:00] Not perfect, just [music] dreaming.
[27:04] You see, I once was lost.
[27:08] But God's blood was shed [music] for me.
[27:12] Nothing I done, it's all God's
[27:15] [music and singing] son hanging on
[27:18] Calvary Street. Jesus [singing] paid my
[27:21] call.
[27:23] I'm just a sign [music and singing] of
[27:25] the cross.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[27:37] [music]
[27:41] &gt;&gt; It's easy [music] to see I'm a simple
[27:44] man that fits the glove
[27:49] [music] of a wondering soul that just
[27:53] didn't know about God's love.
[27:58] But now I've seen the light [music]
[28:00] because he's opened my eyes from the
[28:03] darkness. I've been set free.
[28:06] Now for the rest of my days, I [music]
[28:09] just want to stay kneeling at my
[28:12] Savior's feet.
[28:16] I'm [music and singing] just a sign of
[28:18] the cross.
[28:21] Not [music and singing] perfect, just
[28:23] redeemed.
[28:25] You see, I once [music] was lost,
[28:29] but God's blood was shed [music] for me.
[28:34] Nothing I've done, it's all God's son
[28:38] hanging [music and singing] on Calvar's
[28:40] tree. Jesus made my call.
[28:45] I'm just a sign of the cross.
[28:50] Nothing I've done. [singing] It's all
[28:53] [music] God's son hanging on Calvar's
[28:56] tree. Jesus paid my cost.
[29:01] I just decided [music]
[29:02] the cross.
[29:05] Yeah, he [singing] paid my cost.
[29:10] I'm just a side [music] of the cross.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes,
[29:38] &gt;&gt; you remember the little boy coming
[29:40] down the street one day and he went
[29:43] inside the bar and he told the owner. He
[29:48] said, "Sir, your sign's down."
[29:52] So he walks out there and looks at it
[29:53] and said, "Sunny."
[29:55] Took his rag and polishes his sign. He
[29:58] said, "You must be mistaken. My sign's
[30:02] not down."
[30:04] He said, "But I mean your best sign."
[30:07] And the drunk was laying in the gutter.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Everybody's a sign today.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Sign of grace. Sign of mercy, sign of
[30:16] forgiveness. I want to be a sign of
[30:18] God's love and mercy. Don't you?
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a baby dedication today.
[30:24] Brother Jake and Sister Lydia, if
[30:25] they'll bring a little baby girl, we'll
[30:28] dedicate her to the Lord today.
[30:31] Praise the Lord.
[30:35] [music]
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Bring them [singing] in.
[30:42] Bring them in [music]
[30:45] from the [singing] fields of sin.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Bring them in.
[30:54] Bring [music and singing]
[30:56] them in.
[30:59] Bring the [music] little ones to Jesus.
[31:04] [singing]
[31:10] Wow. Oh, ain't that a beautiful little
[31:11] thing?
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[31:18] Heavenly Father, what a great gift that
[31:21] you've given to my brother and sister.
[31:25] With it comes such an awesome
[31:27] responsibility.
[31:29] I believe they are willing today to
[31:32] assume that responsibility
[31:34] to be able to take their little daughter
[31:37] to raise her in a way the best to their
[31:40] ability
[31:42] that would please you. We know that our
[31:45] children much of what they will become
[31:48] in life is greatly affected by us as
[31:51] parents and adults that affect them.
[31:55] So I pray Lord Jesus that your grace
[31:58] would be upon her.
[32:00] Lord if time should get should have
[32:03] enough time and get old enough. May her
[32:06] heart be surrendered to you when she's
[32:08] young before the evil days come upon
[32:11] her. I pray for her mother the fifth
[32:14] gospel. Help her Lord Jesus to be able
[32:17] to influence her. I pray for her father.
[32:21] May she be able to see a godly man, a
[32:25] man that loves Jesus.
[32:27] May she be able to hear prayers and
[32:30] music and all sorts of godly input in
[32:33] her life. Keep her from the evils of the
[32:36] day and the darkness of the hour that
[32:39] we're living in. Lord Jesus, I dedicate
[32:42] her life to you today for a life service
[32:45] in Jesus name. Amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Congratulations. [applause]
[32:56] Can we stand together?
[33:05] Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2.
[33:11] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[33:13] through the knowledge of God and of
[33:15] Jesus our Lord,
[33:17] according as his divine power hath given
[33:19] unto us all things that pertain unto
[33:22] life and godliness,
[33:25] through the knowledge of him that hath
[33:27] called us to glory and virtue,
[33:30] whereby given unto us exceeding great
[33:32] and precious promises, that by these you
[33:35] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[33:38] having escaped the corruption that is in
[33:40] the world, world through lust.
[33:44] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[33:47] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[33:49] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[33:52] and to temperance patience, and to
[33:55] patience godliness,
[33:57] and to godliness, brotherly kindness,
[34:01] and to brotherly kindness, charity.
[34:04] Let's bow our heads together as we pray
[34:06] over the word today.
[34:09] Heavenly Father, we believe what we have
[34:12] read here today are your great words.
[34:15] You inspired men that they would be able
[34:18] to write the Bible.
[34:20] We know and are able to hear as we turn
[34:25] from page to page, chapter to chapter,
[34:28] book to book that these words are not
[34:32] the words of mere mortal men. their
[34:35] thoughts from a great creator,
[34:39] the only one who could put such things
[34:41] together.
[34:43] Then we call on you today to help us.
[34:46] It'll take your same inspiration to help
[34:50] us to believe it. And then once we
[34:53] believe it, to listen to it and to
[34:56] accept it and live it. For we know that
[34:59] our lives need to be daily sermons,
[35:05] constant sermons after we become
[35:08] Christians, that we're living a life
[35:11] that is pleasing to you. Speak to us
[35:14] today once again from your word. Father,
[35:16] we ask in the name of Jesus. And the
[35:20] saints said,
[35:21] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[35:24] [clears throat]
[35:26] So happy we could be together today.
[35:28] Aren't you glad to be able to come to
[35:30] church?
[35:31] &gt;&gt; What a great privilege it is for us as
[35:33] the people of God. And what an honor it
[35:36] is to be able to assemble ourselves
[35:38] together in in his in his presence. But
[35:42] not only in his presence, but actually
[35:46] in one another's presence. What a great
[35:49] thing it is for people to understand. I
[35:52] realize for a lot of people, church is
[35:54] just going to church. It's a social
[35:56] thing. they don't really get that much
[35:58] out of it. Uh they go to see one
[36:00] another, visit one another, exchange
[36:02] their business ideas and different
[36:05] things like that of what they've done
[36:06] during the week. But I'm so grateful
[36:08] that God is God of people who understand
[36:12] why we go to church and the reason of
[36:15] it. And well, you know, we've been
[36:16] looking at it and I want to go back that
[36:18] way just a little bit today on the
[36:20] attribute and the aspect of godliness.
[36:23] And God loves to go to church himself.
[36:27] God loves to be where his children are,
[36:30] where his people are that he can be able
[36:32] to assemble together with them in order
[36:35] to do things for them. Because the way
[36:38] God looks at it, there's always been
[36:40] special places on the earth that have
[36:43] been set aside for his honor and his
[36:46] glory. The most fought over city on the
[36:49] face of the earth. Jerusalem been taken
[36:53] over and over again. Conquered by every
[36:56] man, every potentate that was coming to
[36:59] take the east. They always wanted
[37:01] Jerusalem as a prize. Still is today.
[37:04] The most sought out place that has ever
[37:07] been on the face of the earth. Why?
[37:09] Because God loves it so much. And we
[37:12] know then that there's a spiritual
[37:13] answering to that, a parallel to that of
[37:16] us being able to come together in the
[37:18] house of God. Whether it's a place like
[37:21] this, this size, whether it be this size
[37:23] over here, u God does not so much
[37:26] impressed by whether there's stained
[37:27] glass windows and gold on the altar,
[37:30] whether there's fine fancy woodwork.
[37:32] What what really gets God's attention is
[37:35] when people come together with a divine
[37:38] purpose, that is to worship him. to
[37:41] worship him and to hear from him that
[37:44] they can see their shortcomings and find
[37:46] out how to be better people. How many
[37:48] came for that reason today? And we know
[37:51] the Lord Jesus himself actually went to
[37:54] church whenever he was here on the
[37:56] earth. And he never found an actual
[37:59] ideal church whenever he was here. You
[38:02] can imagine living now in the first
[38:04] century. So they had synagogues. So
[38:06] Jesus went to the synagogue at Capernium
[38:09] and I told you Carol and I stood there
[38:11] several years ago and they had dug down
[38:14] several feet and found that original
[38:17] Roman era synagogue and they just
[38:19] recently found another city there called
[38:22] Basadia where Peter and Andrew and them
[38:25] different ones are from and it's quite
[38:27] an amazing thing when you think that the
[38:29] Lord Jesus would have went to such a
[38:32] place that was far from imperfect.
[38:34] Nobody ever got saved. Nobody ever got
[38:36] healed. Nobody ever got delivered. But
[38:39] Jesus went to church anyhow, which is a
[38:42] pretty good example, I think, for us as
[38:44] his children. I don't mind telling you
[38:46] before we go further into this today
[38:48] that there would that would be a real
[38:51] difficult time for me to go to some
[38:54] churches and make that my home church.
[38:57] If there was churches that was teaching
[38:59] ideology that was contrary to the word
[39:01] of God, it would be very hard for me to
[39:04] go there. I I don't mind. I'll go a
[39:06] little farther. It would be hard for me
[39:08] to go to some message churches and make
[39:10] them my home church because some of them
[39:13] are so far off of the beaten paths of
[39:16] the word of God. But I will say this,
[39:19] and I was thinking about it earlier this
[39:20] morning. I'm just so grateful that God
[39:23] has allowed us to be able to have a
[39:26] place where we can come together,
[39:28] worship him, see God, not only read
[39:31] about what God did, but see God doing
[39:33] the same things that he's always done.
[39:36] And I trust that we always count that a
[39:38] great honor. In Luke 4:1 16, speaking of
[39:42] Jesus, he came to Nazareth where he had
[39:44] been brought up. and as his custom was.
[39:48] Now, Luke wasn't actually there, of
[39:50] course, at the birth of the Lord Jesus.
[39:52] And Luke wasn't one of the original 12.
[39:55] Luke actually came in years afterwards.
[39:59] So, Luke must have found this out. Part
[40:01] of it by divine inspiration, but part of
[40:03] it by going around and talking to people
[40:06] that was around Jesus. So Luke had found
[40:10] this out somehow that it was the custom
[40:13] of the Lord Jesus to go to church. So it
[40:16] wasn't something that Jesus visited, you
[40:19] know, twice a year, three times a year,
[40:21] but a custom was something that you do
[40:24] over and over and over again. Now, can
[40:26] you imagine going to church over and
[40:29] over and over and over and over again?
[40:32] You saw nobody healed, nobody saved,
[40:34] nobody delivered, but you kept on going
[40:37] anyhow. Would you do that?
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Now, you see, Jesus went because he knew
[40:44] there was one good thing that he could
[40:46] get out of the service. He heard the
[40:49] word being read.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Now, would that be worth it to us to get
[40:55] up, get ready, and drive to church just
[40:59] to hear the word be read?
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Wow. Now, you see what that shows me? It
[41:05] shows me that Jesus had a reverence and
[41:09] an honor and a sacredness for church
[41:13] that most of us don't have.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; The sacredness was knowing God's word
[41:19] was going to be there and that it was
[41:22] going to be read. But many folks go to
[41:24] church out of selfish ideas. What am I
[41:28] going to get? What am I going to take
[41:30] from the service? How am I going to be
[41:33] helped? Are they going to sing my songs?
[41:36] My favorite preacher going to preach?
[41:39] And church really ain't about God. And
[41:42] it's not really about them ministering
[41:43] to others. It's about will the service
[41:47] suit them
[41:50] &gt;&gt; and will their favorite people and I
[41:52] hope sister so and so is wearing that
[41:54] dress and I hope brother Donnie wears
[41:56] that suit I like. And you know is
[41:58] brother Donnie preaching today? Oh, I
[42:00] hope he is because if he ain't there,
[42:02] I'm not sure I can get anything. Shame
[42:04] on you.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; If the word of God is going to be read
[42:07] and the preacher, you may not get five
[42:09] five words out of what he has to say,
[42:12] but if he reads one scripture, you ought
[42:14] to be saying, "Boy, wasn't that
[42:15] scripture awesome? Wasn't them quotes he
[42:18] read, wasn't that absolutely awesome?
[42:19] Wasn't it wonderful to shake the saints
[42:22] of God's hands? Wasn't it something to
[42:25] be there?"
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Wow. I think sometimes we need a little
[42:30] bit instruction maybe on church.
[42:34] Now, I want you to listen to this. I
[42:36] love the way the prophet said this. He
[42:38] says, "And I say you get that bunch of
[42:40] lukewarm church members down to the
[42:42] altar and let them pray through till the
[42:44] Holy Ghost sets her soul on fire.
[42:46] There's no signing cards. God's in their
[42:49] heart. God,
[42:51] he loves to worship." Amen.
[42:56] God's in their heart. God goes to
[42:58] church. He loves to worship. Now, I read
[43:01] this one and the next one I'm fixing to
[43:02] read you the last time we spoke on this,
[43:04] but it's so good. Now, you've got tapes
[43:07] on that. You've got tapes on what we
[43:09] believe. You got tapes on discipline of
[43:11] the church, how we behave oursel in the
[43:14] church of God. But of course this quote
[43:16] cannot apply to you if you don't come to
[43:19] church
[43:23] &gt;&gt; because the tapes was not on how to
[43:25] behave yourself in your house
[43:29] &gt;&gt; but how you behave yourself in church.
[43:33] So this is one quote that a lot of the
[43:36] message people will never have to worry
[43:38] fulfilling will they since they don't
[43:42] come to church
[43:43] &gt;&gt; and they see no need in it.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my praise the Lord. Now watch this.
[43:50] How we behave oursel in the church of
[43:52] God. How we got to come together here
[43:56] together and set together in heavenly
[43:59] places. Got to
[44:03] Got to
[44:08] &gt;&gt; don't stay home.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Now you tell me how people say they
[44:15] believe this is the voice of God
[44:18] on these tapes. And I'll tell you what,
[44:20] they are liars.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about people that ain't
[44:29] got a church in their community to go
[44:31] to. I ain't talking about people that
[44:33] are invalid and people that are sick
[44:35] that their desire is to be in the house
[44:36] of God. I'm talking about people that
[44:39] could go and won't go.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; They're liars.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; I do not care what their name is. I
[44:48] don't care how long they've been in the
[44:49] message. And they say this is the voice
[44:51] of God. They are liars.
[44:54] And all liars go to hell.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. and word of life said,
[45:02] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:08] Preach, Brother Donnie.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Donnie, tell us the truth.
[45:12] Brother Donnie,
[45:15] if God is in your heart,
[45:19] you see that's the problem. If God is in
[45:23] your heart, you can't hardly wait.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, can you imagine if you get
[45:30] into sports, baseball, basketball,
[45:32] whatever your deal is about sports and
[45:35] all that. My goodness, in Tennessee is
[45:38] playing, we'll say Tennessee is playing
[45:41] against Kentucky AND BOY, YOU'RE THERE
[45:44] for Tennessee and and then the Mayo, you
[45:46] get a free ticket. You and your wife and
[45:50] your youngans all get free tickets and
[45:52] you don't know how you got them. and you
[45:54] get free tickets and you've got the best
[45:56] place in the building or coliseum or
[46:00] whatever it is. I don't know anything
[46:01] about all that stuff, but you get all
[46:03] that and you're say, "Well, should we
[46:05] go? Honey, what do you think? I hate to
[46:09] go there. There ain't no telling how
[46:10] many homosexuals will be there. There
[46:13] ain't no telling how many perverts, how
[46:15] many liars, how many people drinking
[46:18] beer, smoking cigarette, chewing tobaca,
[46:21] cursing, lying.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; I don't think we ought to go, do you,
[46:27] honey? But it's Tennessee against
[46:29] Wildcats, you know, and they said this
[46:31] is the biggest game of the year and and
[46:33] they give us these free tickets, but it
[46:36] would be an ungodly atmosphere for us to
[46:39] go.
[46:44] Some of y'all as guilty as a hound dog
[46:46] in the hen house.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all's blushing. I ain't seen
[46:51] you blush in a while.
[46:56] Would you let the homosexuals, the
[46:59] adulterers, the liars, the perverters
[47:02] keep you from that ball game?
[47:08] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Now, you do let them keep you from going
[47:13] to Walmart, right?
[47:15] &gt;&gt; So, all of you now, you order your
[47:17] groceries from Walmart cuz it's such an
[47:19] ungodly atmosphere.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; And yet, if people won't speak to us, we
[47:26] don't go to church.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; We don't like this, we don't go to
[47:29] church. We don't like that, we don't go
[47:30] to church.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Preach it. And the Lord Jesus purchased
[47:34] tickets for every one of you.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; And you're going to be held accountable
[47:40] for not using your ticket. [applause]
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. If God is in your
[47:48] heart, you can't hardly wait for them
[47:49] doors to open yonder to get in there and
[47:52] fellowship
[47:54] with your brother. So you see, going to
[47:55] church is not just about God in the
[47:59] sense of you hearing the word and you
[48:01] just worshiping him and you just singing
[48:03] to him. It's also about fellowship
[48:06] &gt;&gt; with your brothers and sisters.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; If you don't feel that way, then I tell
[48:14] you
[48:16] it's time you got to praying.
[48:20] Cuz we're in the last days where the
[48:22] Bible exalted or exhorted us to much
[48:24] more as we see the day approaching to
[48:26] love one another with Christian love and
[48:28] divine love to assemble ourselves
[48:31] together in heavenly places in Christ
[48:33] Jesus and love one another. This will
[48:36] all men know you're my disciples when
[48:39] you have love one for another. That's
[48:41] right. Stay right together. Amen.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; And word of life said,
[48:47] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Notice this message entitled the token.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; We should love one another more than we
[48:54] ever did in all of our lives. There
[48:57] should be such a hunger
[49:01] to get to church.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Notice the title token.
[49:12] There should be such a hunger to get to
[49:14] church. There should be such a hunger
[49:16] for us to get to one another.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; It should be a love affair.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Not just with you and God,
[49:28] &gt;&gt; but with you and your brothers and
[49:30] sisters.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; I've been missing brother Louie and
[49:35] Sister Glenda Sabath.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Weren't y'all glad to see him up here
[49:39] today? [applause]
[49:46] There ought to be something in us godly.
[49:50] Notice again in who is Jesus, we should
[49:52] assemble ourselves together. The Bible
[49:54] tells us that as we see the end
[49:55] approaching, not of forsaking the
[49:57] assembling of ourselves together. It'll
[50:00] it'll not only do that, it'll strengthen
[50:02] you
[50:04] and your strengths
[50:07] will strengthen
[50:09] the church.
[50:13] Can't you see why Satan don't want
[50:15] people to go to church?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; So, your strengths will strengthen me.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; So, in other words, you rob me.
[50:30] And you rob those around you.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; You're not only robbing yourself,
[50:37] you're robbing us.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; How many robbers will there be in
[50:42] heaven?
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Really?
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Wow,
[50:50] man. This makes me want to have a church
[50:52] revival. All right.
[50:55] [applause]
[50:57] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this in question
[50:59] answers.
[51:01] You see, when the prophet went to
[51:02] Arizona, there was a bunch of the
[51:04] message people that moved out there with
[51:06] him. But he didn't start a church.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; So, the people had the tapes, they had
[51:16] the books, but they also had the prophet
[51:19] himself.
[51:21] but they didn't have a church to go to.
[51:24] Now, a lot of people would think that
[51:26] was the ideal setting, but I want you to
[51:29] listen what happened to those message
[51:31] people that were in that setting. Now, I
[51:35] know a lot of times I speak of the
[51:36] Calvinistic belief. Now, don't think
[51:38] that that lets you loose to do anything
[51:40] you want to do. A fellow the other day,
[51:41] I said, "Did you go to church?" He said,
[51:44] "I went hunting.
[51:47] The man's wife come to me and she's
[51:49] coming from the laundromat
[51:51] on Sunday. I said, "Why didn't you go to
[51:54] church?"
[51:57] She said, "I done my washing." I said,
[52:02] "You shouldn't have done that."
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Now, remember, this is supposed to be
[52:09] the voice of God on tape.
[52:12] Yeah.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Jesus.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Well, she said, "I'm not an old
[52:20] legalist."
[52:22] I said,
[52:23] &gt;&gt; "But I saw you were a Christian."
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice this is a
[52:34] message woman
[52:37] &gt;&gt; and they're there around the prophet
[52:39] himself.
[52:41] But because they didn't have a church to
[52:43] go to, it started working on their
[52:46] attitude.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Now watch, when you lose the sacredness
[52:50] of church and you lose the sacredness of
[52:53] his presence, you also start losing the
[52:57] sacredness
[53:00] of the resurrection.
[53:04] You see, don't never forget one of the
[53:06] reasons that we come to church on Sunday
[53:10] is to honor the resurrection.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; So when you don't do that and you see no
[53:17] need to do it, you start actually
[53:20] dishonoring
[53:23] the resurrection.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; And it goes to losing its value.
[53:30] Now he said, "But I thought you were a
[53:32] Christian." She see I said, "Do you know
[53:36] you're putting a stumbling block
[53:41] in somebody's way?"
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Well, I I believe this and I don't have
[53:46] to do those things. I'm not a legalist.
[53:48] Well, but look, my brother, sister, look
[53:50] here. Paul said, "If eating meat puts a
[53:53] stumbling block in my brother's way,
[53:55] I'll eat meat no more as long as the
[53:58] world stands." Right.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; And I think that'd be a whole lot
[54:01] better.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Now watch. So brother Perry Green and
[54:05] many of you know the history of the
[54:06] message, how it come about there in the
[54:08] west. Brother Perry Green went there and
[54:10] there was assembly of God church and
[54:11] they merged together with another
[54:12] church. So it left this building vacant
[54:15] and empty. Brother Green goes in there
[54:17] and starts a church. Now brother
[54:19] Brandham comes and he wants him in the
[54:21] dedication part. So this is his subject
[54:24] that he deals with and notice his title.
[54:26] What house will you build for me? And
[54:30] now that brother Green, God has sent him
[54:32] in here and opened us up a church of
[54:34] like precious faith that we believe in,
[54:36] we ought to be very grateful to God and
[54:40] attend every service
[54:43] and take every place that we can. I
[54:46] wonder why brother Brandham didn't turn
[54:47] it into a tape only church.
[54:51] Now, if that was the perfect way and
[54:55] that was God's provided way, as we're
[54:57] hearing it said over and over and over
[54:59] again now, that this is God's way for us
[55:03] to hear tapes only,
[55:06] then wonder why Brother Brandham was not
[55:08] the founder of that move.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; And he wasn't.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; The founding of that was not God's
[55:15] prophet,
[55:16] &gt;&gt; cuz he was a scriptural prophet.
[55:19] And if this message come to turn our
[55:21] hearts back to the original faith, do
[55:24] you think they sat at home and read
[55:26] Paul's books?
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Preach, brother Donnie. Do you think
[55:30] they sat at home and looked one another,
[55:32] you know, and just said, "What are you
[55:33] going to do today?" Well, I'm going over
[55:35] to the coliseum to watch the games.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going here. I'm going there. They
[55:41] went to church.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Even though in the first century it
[55:45] could have cost them their life.
[55:50] But they went anyway, didn't they?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice how that he's
[55:55] encouraging
[55:56] the messaged people at that time what to
[55:59] do about this church. If we are asked
[56:03] and called on to pray, to seek, to do,
[56:07] let's be soldiers. Let's be anxious to
[56:10] do it. Keep the message
[56:14] &gt;&gt; honorable.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. and live the right kind of life.
[56:21] Don't let no smut.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; It's sad a lot of message people never
[56:30] read this quote
[56:32] &gt;&gt; or they never believed it after they
[56:34] read it. Don't let no smut
[56:39] come upon it. We're living too late now.
[56:41] We're too late in the hour. Let's live
[56:44] it clean. Anybody agree with that today?
[56:49] &gt;&gt; My life, your life, all of our lives
[56:52] need to be picked up before God. Now
[56:56] watch. He's going to tell us
[56:59] what the message people had got into in
[57:02] that Tucson area with no church to go
[57:04] to.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Our young people just ride around from
[57:09] place to place, show to show,
[57:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:16] message people
[57:18] &gt;&gt; and they had not just the tapes, not
[57:20] just the books, the prophet of God was
[57:23] there with them, too.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; And this is what they had got into. Why
[57:30] church didn't mean nothing. Well,
[57:32] brother Brandham made a preaching. I
[57:33] ain't going I ain't going that old
[57:35] ASSEMBLY OF GOD. I AIN'T going here. I
[57:36] ain't going there. And little did they
[57:38] know, Satan was taking the preciousness
[57:42] of honoring the resurrection away from
[57:45] them.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; So the women went to the laundromat. The
[57:48] men went hunting on Sunday. The kids
[57:50] rode around on their bicycles and went
[57:53] from show to show to show. And they're
[57:55] trying to tell everybody, "YOU WANT WHAT
[57:56] I GOT? Y'ALL are blind. Y'all a bunch of
[58:00] leans. You got to come AND FOLLOW US."
[58:02] WELL, WHERE DO YOU GO TO CHURCH? WE
[58:03] DON'T BELIEVE IN GOING TO CHURCH. WE GO
[58:05] TO the laundromat.
[58:09] And you think you're a light
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus help us. Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; My my
[58:24] young people just ride around from place
[58:26] to place, from show to show and drifting
[58:29] further
[58:31] and further away
[58:36] &gt;&gt; from God.
[58:39] Notice he didn't say from the tapes.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; He didn't say from the prophet.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; From God.
[58:49] Now that's the truth. I see it in my
[58:53] children.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; So you mean the Brandom family was not
[58:58] exempt from drifting
[59:02] &gt;&gt; because they didn't have a church?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, you ain't going to hear this
[59:06] preached by very many. I know you're
[59:08] certainly not going to hear this
[59:10] promoted from headquarters, but I'm
[59:12] called to preach all the message.
[59:15] [applause]
[59:16] I ain't cutting no corners for nobody.
[59:20] It's time that we fess up. Do we believe
[59:22] this is the truth or are we a bunch of
[59:25] rotten, sorry hypocrites?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many message preachers
[59:36] run across across this very quote and
[59:39] they will not read it cuz they don't
[59:41] want to cause nobody hurt feelings?
[59:43] Well, I don't want to hurt your feelings
[59:44] either, but I'd rather hurt your
[59:45] feelings now than for you to go to hell
[59:47] and you point your finger at me and God
[59:49] say, "You're guilty, preacher."
[59:51] [applause]
[59:52] Mhm.
[59:54] Oh my. I see it in my children.
[59:59] COME ON, PROPHET OF GOD, BE HONEST WITH
[1:00:01] US.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; I see it
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; myself.
[1:00:11] You mean brother Brandham needed Harry
[1:00:14] to go to church?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Don't you love this message? Praise God.
[1:00:21] Does this sound like a hypocrite to you?
[1:00:24] Does this sound like a guy that's trying
[1:00:26] to hide things from you? This guy
[1:00:28] exposed his own family and exposed
[1:00:31] himself.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; I can follow such a man.
[1:00:37] You've got to assemble yourselves
[1:00:39] together TO WORSHIP GOD. THE BIBLE said
[1:00:43] so.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see this day approach and
[1:00:48] that much more come together. If there's
[1:00:51] only two people there,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; you
[1:00:57] be one of them.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we come together and worship
[1:01:02] together, then we're just something
[1:01:04] another about it. Jesus said, "Well,
[1:01:06] there's two or three gathered in my
[1:01:09] name, there I am in their midst."
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Trying to do God a service. He's in
[1:01:16] Freeport now. But this time, people had
[1:01:18] already began to misunderstand things
[1:01:21] that Brother Random had said. So he he
[1:01:23] was calling the people out from from
[1:01:27] systems and denominations and people
[1:01:29] were taking quotes that he said remember
[1:01:32] this is about a year after what he said
[1:01:34] in question answer 64 and you're in 3
[1:01:36] months something like that four months
[1:01:38] so he had already picked up on it that
[1:01:40] it was starting to follow the followers
[1:01:43] of the message that the followers of the
[1:01:45] message thought well they don't need to
[1:01:47] go to church they don't have to go to
[1:01:48] church so they were isolating quotes and
[1:01:51] pulling them out and saying Well,
[1:01:52] brother Brandham said, "Come out of
[1:01:54] church. Come out of church." Now, watch
[1:01:55] what God's having him to say. This is
[1:01:58] just a month and a half or so, or a
[1:02:00] month actually before he he's taken from
[1:02:02] the earth. The handwriting is on the
[1:02:04] wall. The second coming is at hand. The
[1:02:06] bride is being chosen, watered out. Now,
[1:02:10] that don't mean draw out from church.
[1:02:13] Now, watch. It's amazing that now he's
[1:02:15] going to insert this just a little while
[1:02:18] before he leaves the earth. Why? The
[1:02:20] spirit of God has already brought his
[1:02:22] attention to it that some of the message
[1:02:25] people are taking these quotes and
[1:02:27] they're making it sound like you don't
[1:02:28] need to go to church no more. So the
[1:02:30] Holy Ghost said, "Let's go ahead and
[1:02:32] take care of this before you leave."
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] Not draw out from church. That means
[1:02:40] draw out from denominationalism.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; You must go to church. Everybody read
[1:02:49] this together with me now on three. One,
[1:02:53] two, three. You must go to church.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Now, your own voice is on God's
[1:03:04] recording.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Now, it just won't be me you'll hear at
[1:03:10] the day of judgment, but you'll hear
[1:03:12] yourself.
[1:03:16] I can quit now if y'all want me to, but
[1:03:18] I got a lot more
[1:03:21] [applause]
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; now. YOU MUST GO TO CHURCH, BUT DON'T
[1:03:25] JOIN ANY ORGANIZATION.
[1:03:28] JESUS WENT
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; all the organizations,
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; but he never joined a one of them,
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; MODERN EVENTS. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, I'M
[1:03:41] NOT TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE TO LEAVE
[1:03:43] CHURCH. WOW. I want you to go to church.
[1:03:47] Don't forsake to assemble yourself
[1:03:49] together. But what I'm trying to tell
[1:03:52] you to do is press into the kingdom of
[1:03:56] God.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; And word of life said,
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; now let's change.
[1:04:05] In order to be godly,
[1:04:09] we have to love what God loves and we
[1:04:12] have to hate what God hates.
[1:04:17] Now, this is a little bit, you know,
[1:04:19] this this would be a little bit
[1:04:21] difficult maybe for some people,
[1:04:24] but there are things that God absolutely
[1:04:28] hates.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; He despises.
[1:04:33] Now before we go on into this, let me
[1:04:35] reassure you that God hates sin,
[1:04:40] but he loves the sinner.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; God hates sin, but he loves the sinner.
[1:04:48] But there are some things that God
[1:04:51] detests,
[1:04:52] and it's actually an abomination to him.
[1:04:55] Read with me in Psalms 45:6. And this is
[1:04:58] a messianic psalm
[1:05:01] of the [clears throat] Old Testament.
[1:05:02] Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever.
[1:05:06] The scepter of thy kingdom is a right
[1:05:09] scepter. I'd like to preach these couple
[1:05:11] of verses to you sometime on a separate
[1:05:13] thing. But thou lovest righteousness and
[1:05:16] hatest wickedness. This is a messianic
[1:05:19] psalm. And David is actually calling the
[1:05:21] Messiah God. This is one of the
[1:05:24] scriptures that the rabbis use. And when
[1:05:27] they believe that the Messiah will be
[1:05:29] God himself. So he said, "Thy throne, oh
[1:05:32] God." So he's calling the Messiah God.
[1:05:35] Thou lovest righteousness and hatest
[1:05:38] wickedness. Therefore God thy God hath
[1:05:43] anointed thee with the oil of gladness
[1:05:47] above thy fellows. So the Messiah hates
[1:05:52] wickedness. I mean believes he hates
[1:05:54] sin. He hates ungodliness. All right.
[1:05:56] Now then if we are going to be like God,
[1:06:00] we must also be like God in love and in
[1:06:04] hatred. But we cannot hate upon our
[1:06:09] feelings being hurt by this certain
[1:06:12] individual or that individual and then
[1:06:14] we express hatred toward them out of
[1:06:18] hurt feelings or disappointment. There's
[1:06:22] only one source by which hatred can be
[1:06:26] perfect.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; That's from a godly heart.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me.
[1:06:37] The only way you and I can hate sin in
[1:06:41] the right way is when our heart is right
[1:06:45] before God.
[1:06:47] Because if we're not careful every time,
[1:06:50] we will lump the sin with the sinner and
[1:06:54] we'll throw the baby out with the
[1:06:56] bathwater
[1:06:58] and we will develop something against
[1:07:00] the individual. And even though they may
[1:07:02] repent and make the situation right, we
[1:07:05] will never let it go in our mind.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, you thought going to church quotes
[1:07:12] was tough? You ain't heard nothing yet.
[1:07:15] But see, God is able and has the
[1:07:18] capability of being able to hate the
[1:07:21] sin. Oh, it's so vile in his sight. And
[1:07:24] yet, if the sinner repents of that sin,
[1:07:27] then God no longer holds that past
[1:07:31] against them. We need help to be able to
[1:07:33] do likewise.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Now, watch. This is part of God's
[1:07:38] character, not dealing with angels, but
[1:07:41] dealing with humans. And we need to be
[1:07:44] godly, not only dealing with God, but
[1:07:47] godly dealing with our brothers and
[1:07:49] sisters and godly dealing with the lost
[1:07:53] world. Read with me in Proverbsap 6:1
[1:07:57] 16. Now I want you to listen to these
[1:07:59] things carefully. [snorts] These six
[1:08:01] things doth the Lord hate.
[1:08:06] Yay, seven are an abomination
[1:08:10] unto him. It do you good to keep these
[1:08:13] verses real close to you.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; A proud look.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; It might be safer for me to go back in
[1:08:22] my office and finish this sermon.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; So, six things that God hates. Yay.
[1:08:31] Seven are an abomination. Now, it's one
[1:08:33] thing for God to hate a thing and then
[1:08:35] for it to move into the abominable
[1:08:38] aspect of God looking at it as an
[1:08:41] abomination.
[1:08:43] So, God hates a proud look,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; a lying tongue.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; I'll pay everybody a penny a piece for
[1:08:56] amens from this point on.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all must not have no lunch
[1:09:02] money.
[1:09:05] These six things doth the Lord hate.
[1:09:08] Yay. S seven are an abomination unto
[1:09:10] him. A proud look, a lying tongue,
[1:09:15] and hands that shed innocent blood.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Now remember, there's more than one way
[1:09:23] you can kill people. And you don't kill
[1:09:25] them necessarily in this day with a
[1:09:27] knife or a gun, but you kill their
[1:09:30] influence.
[1:09:31] You tell lies on them. You tell things
[1:09:34] to bring down their character.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my. A proud look, a lying tongue. I
[1:09:40] want you to notice he's not mentioning
[1:09:42] anything about homosexuality.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And yet homosexuality is an abomination.
[1:09:47] Do you understand? A lying tongue is an
[1:09:50] abomination. Just like two men getting
[1:09:52] married,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; An abomination.
[1:10:00] Come on, brother.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; an heart that devisth wicked
[1:10:12] imagination. So then a heart, notice he
[1:10:15] doesn't say a mind, but a heart. Why?
[1:10:18] Because out of the heart, Jesus picks
[1:10:20] this up in the New Testament. Out of the
[1:10:22] heart proceedth wicked, evil
[1:10:24] imaginations and on and on and on. You
[1:10:27] remember the the scripture. So a heart
[1:10:30] that would devise wicked imagination. So
[1:10:34] they think and they ponder over snares
[1:10:37] and over difficulties and over things
[1:10:39] that will cause people to to stumble.
[1:10:42] Now this is an abomination to God. Feet
[1:10:45] that be swift in running to mischief. So
[1:10:50] people then that they're fast. They're
[1:10:52] not slow held back by. They're just
[1:10:55] quick and doing what they can to to
[1:10:57] bring trouble and cause all kinds of
[1:10:59] heartaches and difficulties. That is an
[1:11:01] abomination to God. And you know what's
[1:11:04] difficult about it is some of these
[1:11:06] people right here might have long hair.
[1:11:08] They may wear long dresses.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Some of these people are here as message
[1:11:13] preachers.
[1:11:15] That's right.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Any of you business brothers hiring this
[1:11:23] week? I might lose my job after today.
[1:11:28] Ah,
[1:11:29] a false witness
[1:11:32] that speaketh lies.
[1:11:35] So, A PERSON SAYING, "BROTHER DAVE
[1:11:37] SWANSON, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE
[1:11:39] THIS AND brother Maddie, he done that
[1:11:40] and that." And boy, brother Dave
[1:11:42] Swanson. Oh my. I'll tell you one thing.
[1:11:45] Do you understand? If you are bearing
[1:11:47] lies.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Now, you might not have even made up the
[1:11:51] lie,
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; but you're carrying somebody else's lie.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; No wonder the Bible tells us to be swift
[1:12:06] to hear, slow to speak, and slow to
[1:12:09] wrath.
[1:12:11] A lot of our motor mouths
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; need to shut up.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; a false witness that beareth wise, and
[1:12:25] he
[1:12:28] that sweth discord
[1:12:31] among brethren,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; an abomination to God.
[1:12:38] God actually hates
[1:12:42] these things.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; So a person that would try to go amongst
[1:12:46] our church or go amongst a a family and
[1:12:50] so discord,
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; do you understand the way God feels
[1:12:53] about that?
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; He hates it.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Let you know wherever church splitting
[1:12:59] preacher stands then.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Now I guess the question is how do you
[1:13:04] feel about him?
[1:13:08] So we love
[1:13:11] we love
[1:13:13] abominations
[1:13:16] if we love these things.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. I'd say the fell down
[1:13:26] at the Baptist church down the road got
[1:13:28] more amens than I got this morning.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Help us, Lord.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 1:14.
[1:13:42] Your new moons and your appointed feasts
[1:13:46] my soul hatest.
[1:13:51] They are a trouble. This is God talking
[1:13:54] now. Unto me.
[1:13:57] I am weary to bear them. And yet the new
[1:14:01] moons and the feast
[1:14:05] were things he gave them.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; So they were doing things
[1:14:14] that God gave them to do. But now God
[1:14:17] says, "I hate it. I HATE WHAT YOU'RE
[1:14:21] DOING."
[1:14:24] WHY, LANCE?
[1:14:27] You imagine they could come back and
[1:14:28] say, "But God, it's in your word. Your
[1:14:30] prophet said at the new moon and the
[1:14:32] Sabbath and and the feast to have a
[1:14:34] feast and dance before me and do what?"
[1:14:36] How could you do that?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Because they lost the sacredness of it.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; It just become ritual and routine.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want church to become that for
[1:14:52] us.
[1:14:54] I know some of you have wondered for
[1:14:56] years and years and other preachers have
[1:14:57] even asked me about it. Brother Donnie,
[1:14:59] why don't you have communion once a
[1:15:00] month? Cuz I've been to some of the
[1:15:02] churches who have communion once a month
[1:15:04] and I've seen the way they take it
[1:15:08] and it's no more than a ritual.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; It's like picking up a peanut butter
[1:15:12] cracker and drinking a glass of Kool-Aid
[1:15:14] to some of them. I do not want that. I
[1:15:17] am not going to have it in our church.
[1:15:19] I'll have it three times a year, four
[1:15:20] times a year, every other year. And if
[1:15:23] it gets to a spot to where that it's
[1:15:25] just common and ritual, we don't
[1:15:27] understand how sacred this is.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THE PROPHET SAID, I just
[1:15:32] finished a study this week. 342 times
[1:15:36] that the prophet uses the word sacred.
[1:15:38] 40some different times. Sacredness. Ah,
[1:15:41] I was overwhelmed by the things that I
[1:15:43] found. sacred desk, sacred pullpit,
[1:15:46] sacred word, sacred moment, sacred
[1:15:49] gifts, all the things that he said was
[1:15:51] sacred. As I studied them, I realized
[1:15:53] how that that element of sacredness is
[1:15:56] leaving our ranks. Oh, may God help us.
[1:15:59] That going to church will ALWAYS BE
[1:16:02] SACRED. THAT SINGING, clapping our
[1:16:05] hands, hearing the word read, oh my,
[1:16:08] living a Christian life, honoring the
[1:16:10] resurrection WILL ALWAYS BE SACRED.
[1:16:13] BECAUSE IF NOT, IF IN TIME GOES ON, GOD
[1:16:16] WILL SAY TO SOME OF THE MESSAGE PEOPLE,
[1:16:19] I HATE I HATE WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; I HATE YOUR DEDICATING BABIES. I HATE
[1:16:28] THE WATER BAPTISMS. I HATE YOUR
[1:16:31] COMMUNION SERVICES.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU ARE DOING IT WITH no feeling, no
[1:16:38] love.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:16:42] Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; God even told him, "Your sacrifices are
[1:16:47] going to stink
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; and my nose."
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Zechariah 8:1 17.
[1:17:00] Let none of you imagine evil in your
[1:17:02] hearts against his neighbor, and love no
[1:17:05] false oath.
[1:17:07] For all these things
[1:17:09] that I hate,
[1:17:12] sayeth the Lord. Malachi 2:15, therefore
[1:17:15] take heed to your spirit and let none
[1:17:19] deal treacherously against the wife of
[1:17:22] his youth. Now remember marriage and
[1:17:23] divorce is very rampant at the end of
[1:17:25] the Old Testament age. The Lord, the God
[1:17:28] of Israel, saith that he hateth
[1:17:32] putting away. You know how God feels
[1:17:34] about divorce? He hates it.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; But in the age we live in. Yeah.
[1:17:42] Whatever. I made a mistake. I changed my
[1:17:45] mind.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet on me.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Lord of mercy. If you get any choir, the
[1:17:54] seats is going to start crying out.
[1:17:58] My my. For one coverth violence with his
[1:18:00] garments, sayaith the Lord of hosts.
[1:18:02] Therefore, take heed to your spirit that
[1:18:05] you deal not treacherously.
[1:18:08] Now, hate is a it's a difficult subject
[1:18:12] in studying.
[1:18:14] It's a difficult subject in bringing it
[1:18:17] together.
[1:18:19] AND YET, GOD WANTS HIS children to hate
[1:18:23] certain things.
[1:18:25] Notice my words. Things.
[1:18:29] Certain things.
[1:18:31] In Revelation 2:6,
[1:18:34] but thou but this thou hast that thou
[1:18:38] hatest the deeds of the nickelans which
[1:18:42] I also hate. Now notice how that this
[1:18:46] church that this is written to in the
[1:18:49] church age that they were displaying
[1:18:52] godliness
[1:18:55] and God wanted to make note of it
[1:18:59] because it meant so much to him. I can
[1:19:02] tell by the look of most of you on your
[1:19:04] face that you're puzzled by this. You
[1:19:06] think why? Why would that matter?
[1:19:08] Because to be like God is more than just
[1:19:10] hair and dress and jumping up and down
[1:19:13] and shouting. It's loving what God
[1:19:15] loves, hating what God hates.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; And God God wanted these people to know
[1:19:21] he was proud of them because they had
[1:19:25] moved into this attribute which very few
[1:19:29] ever will
[1:19:31] that they hate what God hates.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO NOTICE God amened
[1:19:39] their godly attribute. HERE IS GOD
[1:19:43] SAYING back to them, "Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE DOING RIGHT. YOU HATE
[1:19:49] NOTICE GOD DOESN'T say they hated the
[1:19:52] nickelans."
[1:19:54] Now remember this was people in this
[1:19:57] first church age which had already got
[1:20:00] under this thing and the prophet says
[1:20:02] they wanted to get away with that
[1:20:04] fanatical bunch of Christians speaking
[1:20:06] in tongues and all that sort of thing.
[1:20:08] BUT IT WAS ALSO THE ministry the CLERGY
[1:20:13] THAT WAS TRYING TO TAKE ALL OF God out
[1:20:16] of the people and make them the big man.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Come on saints.
[1:20:22] BUT GOD WANTED EVERY PERSON in the
[1:20:25] church to HAVE HIS PRESENCE.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T WANT IT TODAY IN THIS MESSAGE
[1:20:31] FOR THE PASTORS AND THE PREACHERS to be
[1:20:33] the only one that God hears and the only
[1:20:36] one that God loves. God loves you and
[1:20:40] God wants to dwell IN YOU. GOD WANTS TO
[1:20:43] HEAR YOUR PRAYER. GOD WANTS TO LIVE IN
[1:20:46] YOUR soul just AS REAL AS HE DOES THE
[1:20:49] GREATEST preacher in this message.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; SO NOTICE GOD amens now hate.
[1:21:00] Ain't that strange?
[1:21:02] [snorts]
[1:21:04] But this thou hast that thou hatest the
[1:21:07] deeds of the nickelans which I also
[1:21:11] hate. Verse 15.
[1:21:14] SO HAST THOU ALSO THEM THAT HOLD THE
[1:21:18] DOCTRINE. NOW NOTICE we move to another
[1:21:20] church age.
[1:21:23] So it went from deeds.
[1:21:27] So they just kind of started among the
[1:21:29] people trying to divide them and
[1:21:33] separate them and pull them off to their
[1:21:36] little agenda.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; And God called it deeds. But already the
[1:21:41] saints of God, full of the Holy Ghost,
[1:21:43] THAT'S OF THE DEVIL.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; THAT ain't right. That's off the word.
[1:21:47] They're trying to pull people off the
[1:21:49] word.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; So in this verse, God didn't comment
[1:21:55] them because they loved.
[1:21:58] But God commented because they hated,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; not people.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; So hast thou also THEM THAT HOLD THE
[1:22:08] DOCTRINE. So now it moves to the
[1:22:10] doctrinal stage of the nicicoatans
[1:22:14] which thing I hate.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice in this church
[1:22:21] age by the time it comes to them, God
[1:22:24] don't say to this bunch of overcomers
[1:22:28] that you all hate it too.
[1:22:31] But God said, "So hast thou also them
[1:22:35] that hold." So now by this church age
[1:22:38] they had let some of them people come
[1:22:40] among them.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT AMEN THEIR ACTION.
[1:22:47] BUT GOD IS TELLING THEM HIS GODLY VIEW.
[1:22:51] I HATE THIS THING. HOW CAN YOU all
[1:22:54] tolerate it
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; and put your arm around their neck and
[1:22:59] hug them and oh praise God. God said I
[1:23:03] hate this thing.
[1:23:05] But you all have it among you.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; So God hated their deeds
[1:23:16] AND THEIR DOCTRINE.
[1:23:18] YOU SEE, GOD HATES [snorts] THE
[1:23:20] character and the ways of the wicked.
[1:23:26] And the feelings OF ALL OF GOD'S
[1:23:28] RIGHTEOUS, godly people
[1:23:32] are the same.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:35] Mhm.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Malachi 1:3.
[1:23:39] AND I HATED ESAU.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; And laid his mountains and his heritage
[1:23:46] waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
[1:23:49] Romans 9:13. AS IT IS WRITTEN, JACOB
[1:23:52] HAVE I LOVED, but Esau have I hated.
[1:23:58] Now you see the problem is that we when
[1:24:01] we read such scriptures we evaluate this
[1:24:05] word by the way we understand hate.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; So we think God hates like me. Uh-uh.
[1:24:16] No he does not.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; GOD DOES not hate the way humans hate.
[1:24:25] As a matter of fact, it doesn't even
[1:24:27] mean what you think it does.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Genesis 29:29.
[1:24:34] And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter
[1:24:37] Bilha his handmade to be her maid.
[1:24:42] And he Jacob went in also unto Rachel.
[1:24:46] And he loved also Rachel more
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; than Leah.
[1:24:54] and served him yet seven other years.
[1:24:57] But notice the key now to verse 30 is in
[1:25:02] actually verse 31.
[1:25:04] And when the Lord saw that Leah was
[1:25:07] hated.
[1:25:11] Now wait a minute. Verse 30 didn't say
[1:25:13] that Jacob hated her.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; It said that he loved Rachel more.
[1:25:23] Now, I want you to keep in mind now the
[1:25:25] way God had Moses to write it.
[1:25:29] SO, WITH A GODLY hatred
[1:25:33] in the way that God looks at people and
[1:25:36] God say, "I love you. I hate you. I love
[1:25:38] you. I hate you. I love you. I HATE
[1:25:39] YOU." GOD CAN SAY, "I LOVE YOU."
[1:25:44] But then God can look at others and say,
[1:25:47] "But I love you more." Uh-huh.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; And God noted this in Genesis and said,
[1:25:54] let me read it to you again. And he went
[1:25:56] also unto Rachel, and he loved also
[1:25:59] Rachel more than Leah. And when the Lord
[1:26:03] saw that Leah was hated,
[1:26:06] or in other words, loved less,
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; there you go, friends.
[1:26:19] Godly hatred
[1:26:23] does not hate like humans. It does not
[1:26:27] corrupt the heart.
[1:26:30] It is never reacting out of selfishness
[1:26:34] and vindictiveness at all.
[1:26:38] IT ACTUALLY BREAKS THE HEART OF the
[1:26:41] recipient, the one who has it. When they
[1:26:44] hate evil, it actually burdens them.
[1:26:50] It actually breaks the HEART FOR THE
[1:26:52] PEOPLE THAT ARE bound in wickedness and
[1:26:55] idolatry and sin.
[1:26:59] Now, we've all no doubt heard preachers
[1:27:01] preach from the pull pit. And ain't a
[1:27:02] question in my mind, some of them have
[1:27:04] preached out of hatred.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; they ain't no question about they've
[1:27:07] been flat mad.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't mad at the devil.
[1:27:11] Sometimes it's mad at me. sometimes is
[1:27:13] mad at you. Sometimes he's mad at
[1:27:15] somebody else. Come on, somebody.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; And you know it as well as I know it
[1:27:19] that a preacher can stand up there and
[1:27:21] burn your hide. But you know that if
[1:27:23] that man loves you, he's doing that
[1:27:26] because of the love of God in his heart.
[1:27:28] You know that, right? You've experienced
[1:27:29] that. And then you've known others and
[1:27:31] you just felt like they throw this at
[1:27:33] you and throw that at you and you just
[1:27:36] felt some ain't right about that. Some
[1:27:38] just ain't right about it. And a lot of
[1:27:40] times it ain't right. They may be saying
[1:27:43] the truth, BUT IT'S THEIR ATTITUDE.
[1:27:45] THEY'RE SAYING IT OUT OF human anger,
[1:27:48] human vindictiveness. AND WHENEVER GOD
[1:27:50] SAYS, "I HATE THIS AND I HATE THAT."
[1:27:53] IT'S NOT FROM A HUMAN anger that God is
[1:27:56] mad. You are you broke MY WORD. YOU
[1:27:59] STEPPED ON MY WORD. I WANT TO GET BACK
[1:28:01] AT YOU. NO, THAT'S THE WAY US HUMANS
[1:28:03] DOES. BUT WHEN GOD SAYS, "I hate,"
[1:28:08] he says, "I want you to be better."
[1:28:10] Amen.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; I want you to be changed.
[1:28:19] So God loved Jacob more than he did
[1:28:24] Esau. Now watch this. In Luke 14 26,
[1:28:29] the words of the Lord Jesus himself.
[1:28:33] If any man will come to me and hate not
[1:28:40] his father
[1:28:43] and mother
[1:28:46] and wife
[1:28:48] and children and brethren
[1:28:54] and sisters.
[1:28:58] So you mean the requirement
[1:29:01] to be a Christian is to hate your daddy,
[1:29:08] hate your mother, hate your wife,
[1:29:12] hate your children.
[1:29:16] Oh, I saw the light come over some of
[1:29:18] you. Praise the Lord. You're smiling
[1:29:19] now, Brother Danny. Thank God.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; If any man COME TO ME AND HATE NOT HIS
[1:29:26] FATHER, NOW LET'S TAKE IT LITERALLY JUST
[1:29:28] LIKE JESUS said it. In order to be a
[1:29:31] Christian, YOU GOT TO HATE EVERYBODY
[1:29:33] around you. I know some people that sure
[1:29:36] would fulfill that easy enough.
[1:29:40] [laughter]
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; And they ain't a Christian a bit more
[1:29:43] than the devil is.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[1:29:46] They can't do it from a godly heart.
[1:29:48] Jesus is not teaching us to hate OUR
[1:29:50] FATHER. JESUS IS NOT TEACHING TEACHING
[1:29:53] US TO HATE OUR MOTHER. HE'S teaching us
[1:29:55] to love them less.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love God's word. Don't you? Oh my.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; If any man come to me AND HATE NOT HIS
[1:30:07] father and mother and wife and children
[1:30:09] and BRETHREN AND SISTERS, YAY, AND HIS
[1:30:11] OWN LIFE ALSO,
[1:30:14] he cannot be
[1:30:16] my disciple.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:20] Matthew 10:37,
[1:30:22] he that loveth father or mother.
[1:30:28] You see, this is one of the great things
[1:30:30] about God having four gospels.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; For those of you that never really
[1:30:35] studied your Bible that much, you'd be
[1:30:37] surprised how many of these same
[1:30:40] instances are written by Matthew, Mark,
[1:30:42] Luke, and John. And all four of them
[1:30:44] will say it a little bit different way.
[1:30:48] and they're recalling the same story.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Well, come on now. Folks have left the
[1:30:53] message for doing that. And I've sent
[1:30:55] quotes to a bunch of them in scriptures
[1:30:56] and told them if they don't quit
[1:30:58] believing the Bible, they're a bunch of
[1:31:00] hypocrites. Cuz the Bible is wrote the
[1:31:03] exact same way.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Now, here, I want you to notice this.
[1:31:06] Now, Matthew is writing the same
[1:31:10] instance, but notice how he phrases it.
[1:31:13] He that loveth father or mother more
[1:31:17] [groaning]
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; than me.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; How many love yourself here today?
[1:31:26] DIDN'T YOU ALL HEAR WHAT I SAID ABOUT
[1:31:28] LYING TONGUES?
[1:31:33] How many love yourself? I'm putting my
[1:31:35] hand up cuz I do.
[1:31:39] There ain't nothing wrong with ME LOVING
[1:31:42] MYSELF
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I DON'T LOVE ME more than I
[1:31:46] LOVE HIM.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS ME TO LOVE MY SISTERS, my
[1:31:51] brothers, my family. I love my MOTHER
[1:31:54] AND MY FATHER AND both of them are gone.
[1:31:55] I still love them. I love people that
[1:31:58] don't love me. And there's nothing wrong
[1:32:00] with that. As a MATTER OF FACT, HE WANTS
[1:32:02] ME TO. BUT HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO LOVE
[1:32:06] ANYONE more than him. SO WE SAY, WELL, I
[1:32:10] HATE MYSELF. AND THE TRUTH of that is
[1:32:13] yes.
[1:32:15] And in our language of scriptural
[1:32:17] meaning and understanding, it simply
[1:32:19] means I love myself less.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SAY GOD HATES EVERYBODY BUT THE
[1:32:27] BRIDE. THAT'S contrary to the Bible.
[1:32:30] The Lord Jesus, the very heart of God in
[1:32:32] John 3:16 says this, "God so
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; loved,
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; not hated.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; GOD so loved the bride, [screaming]
[1:32:43] the world, THE WORLD. GOD HATES THEIR
[1:32:48] SIN. HE HATES THEIR FAIL." But God loves
[1:32:51] them. IT'S NOT EVEN HIS WILL THAT ANY
[1:32:54] SHOULD PERISH. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL,
[1:32:56] BECAUSE OUR MESSAGE IS SUCH A MESSAGE OF
[1:32:59] SEPARATION AND ISOLATION FROM THE WORLD,
[1:33:02] WE WILL NOT EVEN LET OUR LIGHT BE
[1:33:04] EFFECTIVE. I AIN'T GETTING AROUND THAT
[1:33:05] BUNCH OF DEVILS. THEY'RE A BUNCH OF
[1:33:07] Baptists and men wear shorts. THEY DO
[1:33:09] THIS, THAT, THE OTHER. WELL, LET YOUR
[1:33:11] LIGHT SOUL SHINE THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE
[1:33:14] TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR
[1:33:16] LIFE. BROTHER DONN, IS IT OKAY TO LOVE
[1:33:18] THEM? BY [screaming] ALL MEANS, LOVE
[1:33:21] THEM. LOVE THE DRUNK ON THE STREET. LOVE
[1:33:24] THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOST WITHOUT GOD.
[1:33:27] LET THEM KNOW THE REAL LOVE of God.
[1:33:36] [sighs]
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Get out of here, devil.
[1:33:43] Thank you.
[1:33:45] Notice Psalm 139:22.
[1:33:51] I hate them
[1:33:55] with perfect hatred.
[1:34:00] Praise the Lord. Everybody okay?
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; All of our nurses standing post supposed
[1:34:05] to do now.
[1:34:07] I HATE THEM WITH PERFECT HATRED. I count
[1:34:11] them mine enemies.
[1:34:13] YOU SEE, A perfect hatred of evil
[1:34:17] can only proceed
[1:34:20] from a heart which loves those that are
[1:34:24] in that sin and filth and debauchery.
[1:34:30] AND YET HUMANS WILL TRY TO USE THIS
[1:34:32] scripture and justify their hatred for
[1:34:35] people who've hurt them
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, David said he had a
[1:34:39] perfect hatred. I HATE THIS BROTHER."
[1:34:41] I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE LEFT my
[1:34:43] church. This man done this. THIS WOMAN
[1:34:45] DON'T I I HATE HIM. IT'S A perfect
[1:34:47] hatred. Don't sound perfect to me. I
[1:34:50] mean, I'm just saying.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have thought perfect hatred
[1:34:54] would cause you to bust your teeth with
[1:34:55] your goodness.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; It cannot be perfect
[1:35:04] if it doesn't proceed from a heart
[1:35:08] filled with love
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; for those people who've done you wrong.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; How many has been hurt by people?
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; This is the most honest y'all have been
[1:35:20] all morning.
[1:35:21] I figured I'd get you somewhere. How
[1:35:24] many's been hurt by people?
[1:35:26] So, you're going to ride all people off
[1:35:28] then, right?
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; What? How many's been hurt by preachers?
[1:35:33] I put my leg up, too. Yep. I do the
[1:35:36] other one, too, but I can't spread ride
[1:35:37] that part. OH, HOW MANY BEEN HURT, LET
[1:35:40] DOWN, DISAPPOINTED? WE ALL HAVE.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SHALL NEVER BE HURT AGAIN. AND
[1:35:44] you realize who you're robbing the most
[1:35:46] by that attitude? Yourself.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; SURE, WE'VE BEEN HURT BY PEOPLE. SURE,
[1:35:50] WE'VE BEEN LET DOWN BY PEOPLE. BUT THAT
[1:35:52] DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME GOOD, GODLY
[1:35:54] people left in this world. MANY OF YOU
[1:35:56] HAVE BEEN HURT BY PREACHERS, LET DOWN BY
[1:35:58] PREACHERS. SO HAVE I. BUT THAT DON'T
[1:36:00] MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME MEN OF GOD IN THIS
[1:36:03] WORD THAT STILL LOVES THE LORD JESUS
[1:36:05] WITH ALL OF THEIR HEARTS. BUT KEEP IN
[1:36:07] MIND, EVERY PREACHER, I DON'T CARE WHO
[1:36:09] HE IS, HE IS A HUMAN BEING AND HE IS A
[1:36:12] work in progress. Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Read with me in Galatians 5:1 19 and
[1:36:22] we'll start closing down.
[1:36:28] Now the works of the flesh are manifest,
[1:36:30] which are these: adultery, fornication,
[1:36:34] uncleanliness,
[1:36:35] lasciviousness,
[1:36:38] idolatry,
[1:36:39] witchcraft,
[1:36:42] hatred.
[1:36:46] So you mean God would put human hatred
[1:36:49] right next to witchcraft?
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:55] and idolatry and emulation and wraths
[1:36:58] and strife and seditions and hearsay. So
[1:37:02] God cannot hate
[1:37:05] with this kind of hate.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Can y'all say amen to that?
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Let's see if you can amen this. Then God
[1:37:15] don't want you to.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; It's not godly.
[1:37:24] to hate people
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; like this.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; It's ungodly.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Our hair, our dress, we don't go here,
[1:37:34] we don't go there, we don't do that. Oh,
[1:37:35] that's well and good. But what good does
[1:37:38] all of that do if you've got a heart
[1:37:42] full
[1:37:43] of hate? Amen.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Envyings, murders, drunkenness, reings,
[1:37:53] and such like, of the which I tell you
[1:37:56] before, as I have also told you in time
[1:37:58] past, that they which do such things
[1:38:01] shall not inherit
[1:38:05] the kingdom of God.
[1:38:08] Amen.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Friends, what a terrible thing
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; to go to church for years of your life
[1:38:15] and have a heart full of this type of
[1:38:19] hatred
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; and wind up being lost.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; This is serious. Yes.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:9, he that saith he is in the
[1:38:31] light and hateth his brother,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; is in darkness even until now.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; He that loveth his brother abideth in
[1:38:43] the light, and there is none occasion of
[1:38:45] stumbling in him. But he that hateth his
[1:38:48] brother. So there is a way apparently
[1:38:52] that a person can absolutely hate their
[1:38:55] brother and be convinced that they're
[1:38:59] right with God.
[1:39:02] He that hateth his brother is in
[1:39:05] darkness and walketh in darkness. So he
[1:39:07] behaves his mannerism is in darkness and
[1:39:11] knoweth not whether he goeth
[1:39:14] because that darkness
[1:39:17] hath blinded his eyes.
[1:39:22] You see it's the type of hatred that
[1:39:24] Satan wants in our hearts.
[1:39:27] It would be a similar hatred that
[1:39:31] Iran
[1:39:33] has for Israel.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Just in the last six months,
[1:39:40] they have sent over a billion dollars
[1:39:43] to Hezbollah
[1:39:45] in the country of Lebanon
[1:39:48] to build up their arms to try to destroy
[1:39:52] Israel.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:39:54] THEY'VE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
[1:39:56] sending it to Hamas,
[1:39:59] to the other in Fatada, the other
[1:40:01] different groups. Why?
[1:40:03] Because they hate Israel so bad. And yet
[1:40:08] Iran is fixing to have to evacuate
[1:40:12] their capital city of Thrron,
[1:40:17] which holds millions of people,
[1:40:20] because they have no water.
[1:40:28] Look, I I realize I'm not the smartest
[1:40:30] kid on the block, but you think, why
[1:40:32] didn't they take some of that money and
[1:40:35] figure out how to do desalination plants
[1:40:37] or pump water from here to there to
[1:40:39] there? But it's like they are obsessed
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; with destroying Israel.
[1:40:48] And I like what I heard Marco Rubio say
[1:40:52] a little while back
[1:40:54] as he was standing under a portion of
[1:40:57] the Temple Mount
[1:41:00] where archaeologists have put big Ibeams
[1:41:03] of steel and dug down and found the
[1:41:07] original steps
[1:41:09] where the people would come from the
[1:41:11] pool of Sylum and go up to the temple.
[1:41:18] AND MARCO RUBIO STOOD THERE AND he said,
[1:41:21] "Where are all those nations who tried
[1:41:24] to destroy Israel?"
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; The Romans, he said, "Their kingdom has
[1:41:30] been annihilated. THE ASSYRIANS HAVE
[1:41:33] BEEN ANNIHILATED. THE BABYLONIANS
[1:41:36] HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; And there's one people left, the people
[1:41:41] of Israel."
[1:41:44] Oh my. [applause]
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; But you see WHAT HATRED WILL DO? HATRED
[1:41:52] WILL DRIVE people
[1:41:55] to annihilate themselves
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; because they hate this entity OR THIS
[1:42:01] GROUP. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NOT NOT ALL,
[1:42:03] BUT SOME OF THOSE who've left the
[1:42:04] message, they have such a hatred FOR
[1:42:09] GOD'S PROPHET.
[1:42:11] THEY HAVE SUCH A HATRED FOR THIS MESSAGE
[1:42:14] AND SUCH A HATRED for you who follow it
[1:42:18] and a hatred for the preachers. Some of
[1:42:20] them hate me so terribly. They would
[1:42:23] kill me
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; if they could get BY WITH IT. WELL, LET
[1:42:27] ME JUST SAY IT TO YOU THIS WAY. IF I WAS
[1:42:29] THINKING ABOUT leaving the message, and
[1:42:31] I ain't, I certainly wouldn't go to none
[1:42:34] OF THEM BECAUSE I DON'T SEE more of God
[1:42:38] in their lives. I see less than what
[1:42:40] they had when they was among us.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT SOME OF THE PREACHERS that have
[1:42:44] left and preaching and saying and doing
[1:42:46] the things they're doing and they want
[1:42:48] to win me. They want to win you. THEY
[1:42:51] WANT US TO FOLLOW THEM. AND WHAT HAVE
[1:42:54] THEY DONE?
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; COME ON SOMEBODY. BUT YOU SEE WHEN YOU
[1:42:58] GET SO UNDER HATRED, YOU LOOK AT THE
[1:43:01] IRANIAN PEOPLE. THEY ARE SUFFERING
[1:43:03] BECAUSE THEIR LEADERS ARE UNDER THIS
[1:43:06] HATRED.
[1:43:09] for the Jews and they can hate him till
[1:43:12] they burn turn blue in the face and bury
[1:43:14] every one of them. And when there is no
[1:43:16] more Iran, Israel is still the chosen
[1:43:19] nation of God. AND WHEN OH MY ALL THE
[1:43:23] MESSAGE FIGHTERS AND ALL THE MESSAGE
[1:43:25] HATERS DIE, GO MY TO THEIR PLACE
[1:43:28] WHEREVER THAT WILL BE AND THEY STAND
[1:43:30] BEFORE GOD. DON'T WORRY LITTLE CHILDREN.
[1:43:33] ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS WORD WILL CATCH
[1:43:36] YOUR SOUL OUT OF HERE. IT WILL NOT BE
[1:43:39] OUT OF HATRED. IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF
[1:43:41] VARIANCE AND STRIFE, BUT out of love.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; The stand
[1:43:51] [applause]
[1:43:57] first John 3:15, "Whosoever
[1:44:00] hateth his brother
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; is a
[1:44:08] murderer.
[1:44:11] And you know
[1:44:13] that no murderer
[1:44:15] has eternal life
[1:44:18] abiding in him.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 verse 20. And if a man
[1:44:26] say, [snorts]
[1:44:28] "I love God,"
[1:44:32] and hateth his brother,
[1:44:35] he
[1:44:37] is a
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; liar.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; For he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:44:45] he hath seen, how can he love God
[1:44:49] whom he hath not seen?
[1:44:54] How many wants to be godly?
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Love the things God loves
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; and hates the things
[1:45:05] that God hates.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; And look at things that are sin and evil
[1:45:10] and wrong
[1:45:12] and out of a heart of love. Brother
[1:45:14] Malachi, not vengeance, vindictiveness,
[1:45:19] but out of a heart of love.
[1:45:24] Let's bow our heads together.
[1:45:31] Heavenly Father, as we stand here today,
[1:45:33] Lord,
[1:45:36] I realize this has not been a sermon
[1:45:38] that made us all probably really happy
[1:45:41] and
[1:45:43] they just want to get up and run around
[1:45:44] the building. Probably most of us wanted
[1:45:47] to crawl out.
[1:45:50] Father, we we want to thank you for
[1:45:53] truth.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; We desire, Lord Jesus,
[1:45:58] that we can be godly.
[1:46:02] I'm sure like me, these people have been
[1:46:04] overwhelmed,
[1:46:06] all this that we've looked at under the
[1:46:09] attribute of godliness.
[1:46:12] But we thank you for it, Father. For
[1:46:15] truly we desire to be godly.
[1:46:19] Lord Jesus, I ask you that you'd help
[1:46:21] each man, woman, boy, and girl.
[1:46:24] May we search our hearts.
[1:46:27] I know some of them, Lord, have been so
[1:46:29] hurt by people and disappointed and let
[1:46:31] down, and they've been through so many
[1:46:33] things. as I sat back in the office and
[1:46:36] whenever I counsel them and hear the
[1:46:39] terrible things that many of them have
[1:46:40] been through, not only these people, but
[1:46:42] ones I've had to talk to around the
[1:46:44] world, they've experienced heartbreaking
[1:46:47] things.
[1:46:49] But yet, Lord Jesus, we believe that
[1:46:51] your power can so come into our lives
[1:46:54] that it helps us instead of being harsh,
[1:46:58] mean, full of hatred, vindictive,
[1:47:02] we can be forgiving, loving, gentle, and
[1:47:06] kind.
[1:47:08] Father, we want to hate the deeds of the
[1:47:12] nickelans,
[1:47:14] but yet love them.
[1:47:16] We don't want to be like that church age
[1:47:18] as time went on into another church age.
[1:47:22] And then when it become doctrine,
[1:47:25] God could not say to the people of that
[1:47:27] age, you hate it cuz I hate it. But God
[1:47:32] said, you have.
[1:47:34] So they had allowed the doctrine of the
[1:47:38] nickelans.
[1:47:40] And God had to separate himself from
[1:47:42] where the church was standing.
[1:47:44] And God let them know, I hate that
[1:47:47] thing, but it's easy to see you don't.
[1:47:52] You've embraced it. Maybe under the
[1:47:55] disguise of love.
[1:47:58] But how can it be true love when we love
[1:48:01] something that you hate? You hate
[1:48:05] discord. You hate division,
[1:48:08] telling lies,
[1:48:10] spreading gossip.
[1:48:12] You hate all these things, Lord.
[1:48:15] So, how can we embrace them and say,
[1:48:17] "Well, it's the work of God. Oh, yes,
[1:48:20] God is doing this and doing that." When
[1:48:22] God himself says, "Don't identify me
[1:48:25] with that. I hate that."
[1:48:29] So, how is it, Lord, that we can embrace
[1:48:31] so many this compromising spirit comes
[1:48:34] in the ranks of our message?
[1:48:37] And like Israel, we'll let the Amorites
[1:48:39] live and the Hittites live and the
[1:48:42] Jebusites live.
[1:48:47] It started with just one of the small
[1:48:49] tribes and then it grew from one to the
[1:48:51] other to the other until before long in
[1:48:55] their ranks were unbelievers, infidels,
[1:48:58] agnostics,
[1:49:00] marrying among them.
[1:49:04] What a sad thing.
[1:49:06] It won't be but a few more settings of
[1:49:08] the sun. We can already see it, Lord.
[1:49:13] As I see preacher friends of mine that
[1:49:16] they don't believe this that the prophet
[1:49:18] taught and some don't believe that that
[1:49:20] he taught and some don't believe this
[1:49:21] that he taught. Well, this this was just
[1:49:23] an idea in the 50s and the 60s and
[1:49:26] brother Brandham was under this
[1:49:27] influence of this and that and the
[1:49:28] other. I never thought I'd ever live to
[1:49:33] hear such words comes out of message
[1:49:35] men's mouths,
[1:49:37] but here we are.
[1:49:40] So, Father, we pray you'd help us
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; to stay true. And then, Lord, we we
[1:49:46] admit
[1:49:48] we need your help. How do we treat those
[1:49:51] brothers who say such things?
[1:49:55] How do we treat them? When we see the
[1:49:57] prophet teaching this, this, this, don't
[1:49:59] do that, don't do that, don't do that,
[1:50:01] and they do it and they bless it and say
[1:50:03] it's of God,
[1:50:06] then how do we treat them?
[1:50:08] Do we shun them? Do we stay away from
[1:50:11] them? Do we not speak to them anymore?
[1:50:16] Or do we disagree with what they're
[1:50:17] doing and still pray for them and love
[1:50:19] them from our heart?
[1:50:22] We need you, Lord.
[1:50:24] David faced the same thing. It's easy to
[1:50:26] stand when a bear is charging against
[1:50:28] you and and raise up against him and
[1:50:30] take his life.
[1:50:33] A lion charges against you and you pick
[1:50:36] up a piece of armament and you take his
[1:50:39] life.
[1:50:41] But how do you deal with King Saul?
[1:50:46] A man who is the anointed of the Lord. A
[1:50:50] man who is a king chosen by God himself.
[1:50:56] Teach us, Lord. We know David slipped
[1:50:59] into the cave and just cut a small piece
[1:51:01] of his garment off just to let Saul know
[1:51:04] how close it got to him. And the Bible
[1:51:07] says his heart smoteed him.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; We need help, Lord, to know how to deal
[1:51:12] with the times that we're in.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I don't mind telling you,
[1:51:16] Lord, I'm shocked and surprised by some
[1:51:19] of the things I hear some of the message
[1:51:20] preachers saying and doing.
[1:51:23] We just need your help cuz we don't want
[1:51:26] to compromise,
[1:51:28] Lord God. Neither do we want to get to a
[1:51:30] spot we think we're the only just us and
[1:51:32] four more and no more. That's all. No,
[1:51:35] Lord. We don't want that old
[1:51:36] ecclesiastical thing.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Teach us, Jesus.
[1:51:42] We love you, Father.
[1:51:44] with all of our hearts,
[1:51:47] praise the Lord.
[1:51:51] I wonder how many of you today would
[1:51:53] just with your heads still bowed, please
[1:51:57] raise your hand to the Lord and say,
[1:52:00] "Lord, I I I need help. I I realize,
[1:52:04] Lord, maybe I've been I've been
[1:52:05] supporting things and standing with
[1:52:07] things just that you hate. It makes me
[1:52:10] feel awful, Lord.
[1:52:12] makes me feel awful.
[1:52:15] I want to be right. Lord, teach us.
[1:52:18] God bless you. Now, I'm going to pray
[1:52:20] for pray for each of you. Also, we got
[1:52:23] this prayer request here. Please pray
[1:52:25] for Lincoln Hornyak. He's been taken to
[1:52:27] the ER for continued vomiting that is
[1:52:30] recurring.
[1:52:33] Heavenly Father, we pray for Brother
[1:52:35] Lincoln today. Lord,
[1:52:37] you see this need in his body, Lord
[1:52:39] Jesus. What's causing this vomiting?
[1:52:42] In the name of Jesus, I resent this
[1:52:45] thing from our brother. May the spirit
[1:52:48] of God move forward.
[1:52:50] Lord, we join our faith together as your
[1:52:52] believing children.
[1:52:55] Lord, we know this is one of the many
[1:52:57] reasons why we don't want hatred in our
[1:53:00] hearts.
[1:53:01] For we know if we hide sin or we've got
[1:53:04] things in our heart, you won't hear us
[1:53:07] when we pray.
[1:53:09] And Lord God, we've got so many needs
[1:53:11] among us in the day and hour that we
[1:53:13] live. We don't want our prayers
[1:53:15] hindered.
[1:53:17] The husbands and wives don't need to
[1:53:19] argue and fuss and debate and so on in
[1:53:21] their home.
[1:53:23] Peter wrote about it lest their prayers
[1:53:25] would be hindered.
[1:53:27] We need each other so desperately in
[1:53:30] this hour. Father,
[1:53:32] help us Lord.
[1:53:34] It's easy for me to see, Father, why the
[1:53:36] very last attribute
[1:53:39] before going up into your love is
[1:53:42] brotherly kindness.
[1:53:45] Is it that it will be the hardest to
[1:53:47] achieve?
[1:53:50] It will be the very capping stone by
[1:53:52] which divine love sets on top of the
[1:53:55] closest connection to God himself.
[1:53:59] brotherly love.
[1:54:01] Teach us, Jesus.
[1:54:04] Teach us, oh God.
[1:54:06] Teach me as a minister. Help me, Father.
[1:54:10] Help me to know how to deal with issues.
[1:54:12] Father, help me. I pray, Lord.
[1:54:17] Oh God, we love you today with all of
[1:54:19] our hearts. Jesus,
[1:54:22] come near us now, Lord.
[1:54:24] If you see anything in my heart,
[1:54:28] Lord God, that I'm identified with that
[1:54:31] you hate, make it known to me, Jesus.
[1:54:36] May you search every heart. Begin here
[1:54:38] on the platform with me first. Then
[1:54:41] Lord, while you're here, go to the
[1:54:43] musicians,
[1:54:45] song leaders, deacons, trustees,
[1:54:48] all of us. Father, go to the mezzanine
[1:54:51] in the back.
[1:54:53] Go to the sound room up in the top the
[1:54:55] audio brothers there in the internet.
[1:54:59] Go out on the streaming. Father,
[1:55:03] may every heart be searched today.
[1:55:07] What a heartbreaking thing to know that
[1:55:09] we love something you hate
[1:55:15] or we hate something or someone that you
[1:55:19] love.
[1:55:22] Saul developed a hatred in his heart
[1:55:25] against a man
[1:55:28] who was after your heart.
[1:55:31] It shows us what hatred can do. And
[1:55:34] Saul's love changed from the love the
[1:55:38] way a father would love as a son to way
[1:55:41] an enemy would hate another enemy.
[1:55:45] Keep me from such Jesus.
[1:55:49] Keep our church from hatred.
[1:55:52] Keep us Lord God from the evil of
[1:55:55] rottness and corruption
[1:55:57] in the last day. Father
[1:56:01] grant it Lord Jesus.
[1:56:04] Oh hallelujah.
[1:56:07] Hallelujah.
[1:56:09] Sing something for us. Hey.
[1:56:12] Oh my.
[1:56:14] Let's just allow before we go here. I
[1:56:17] won't keep you much longer.
[1:56:20] The presence of God
[1:56:23] just to come by our way now in this
[1:56:26] cleansing, scouring
[1:56:29] type of service.
[1:56:32] Let him look down deep in us.
[1:56:36] Remember, you're a triune being.
[1:56:39] your outward being, your flesh, your
[1:56:42] spirit, imagination, conscience, memory,
[1:56:45] reason, affection, and then your soul.
[1:56:50] May the spirit of God search every
[1:56:53] avenue
[1:56:54] of every one of us right here today and
[1:56:56] see if he finds anything
[1:57:00] that displeases him. Are you willing to
[1:57:03] let go of it? Are you willing to let go
[1:57:06] if he finds something? Would you just
[1:57:09] raise your hand to him and say, "Lord,
[1:57:12] take it from me, Jesus.
[1:57:15] You have my permission. Oh God,
[1:57:19] hallelujah.
[1:57:22] We worship you, Lord.
[1:57:25] We praise you, Jesus.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; We praise you, Jesus.

[2:02:06] On [singing]
[2:02:07] earth. I want [music]
[2:02:13] to be [singing]
[2:02:15] like you.
[2:02:18] [music]
[2:02:20] All through [singing]
[2:02:21] life's journey
[2:02:24] [music]
[2:02:26] from earth to glory.
[2:02:30] [music]
[2:02:33] I [singing] only
[2:02:35] am
[2:02:39] to [music and singing] be
[2:02:41] my king.
[2:02:46] Empty
[2:02:48] [music]
[2:02:56] [music]
[2:02:58] and broken.
[2:03:01] I came back [music and singing]
[2:03:04] to him.
[2:03:07] A vessel [singing]
[2:03:10] unworthy. [music]
[2:03:13] So [singing]
[2:03:15] scarred by sin.
[2:03:18] But he [music] did not [singing]
[2:03:21] despair.
[2:03:23] He [music] started over [singing]
[2:03:26] again.
[2:03:29] And I'm
[2:03:32] blessed [singing and music]
[2:03:32] today.
[2:03:34] He didn't throw
[2:03:37] the clay [music and singing] away.
[2:03:40] Over
[2:03:45] [music]
[2:03:46] and over
[2:03:49] he pulls me [music and singing] and
[2:03:52] makes me
[2:03:55] into
[2:03:57] his likeness. [music]
[2:04:00] He fashions [singing]
[2:04:03] the [music] clay.
[2:04:08] A vessel
[2:04:11] on [singing] earth
[2:04:13] [music] I am today.
[2:04:19] And it's all because [singing]
[2:04:22] Jesus [music]
[2:04:24] didn't throw the flame away.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; He is
[2:04:35] a potter.
[2:04:38] I am
[2:04:41] the flame. [music and singing]
[2:04:44] Only
[2:04:45] in his image
[2:04:48] is how he wants me [music and singing]
[2:04:51] to stay.
[2:04:53] But when I stumble [singing]
[2:04:56] and I fall [music]
[2:04:59] and my vessel
[2:05:02] breaks, [music]
[2:05:04] he just picks up all [singing] the
[2:05:07] broken pieces. [music]
[2:05:09] He doesn't roll
[2:05:12] the clay [music] way.
[2:05:18] [music]
[2:05:18] Over [singing]
[2:05:20] and over.
[2:05:23] He molds me [music]
[2:05:26] and makes me
[2:05:29] [music] to his likeness.
[2:05:34] [music] I passions
[2:05:37] of grace.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:05:45] [singing and music]
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; I am to [music and singing]
[2:05:54] be because [music] Jesus
[2:05:57] didn't throw
[2:05:59] it [music and singing] away.
[2:06:05] Oh, over [singing]
[2:06:08] and over.
[2:06:11] He knows me and makes
[2:06:15] [music and singing] me
[2:06:17] into
[2:06:19] his liking.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; passions
[2:06:24] the grauses
[2:06:27] [music]
[2:06:32] [music]
[2:06:38] [music]
[2:06:42] [singing]
[2:06:45] [music]
[2:06:47] the
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; He is
[2:06:56] the potter. [singing]
[2:06:59] I am [music] the clay. [singing]
[2:07:05] Holding
[2:07:06] it is [music] in me.
[2:07:10] He [singing] wants me
[2:07:12] to stay. [music]
[2:07:14] But when I stumble
[2:07:17] and [music] I fall
[2:07:20] in my [singing] vessel
[2:07:23] [music] grace,
[2:07:25] he just picks up all [singing] the
[2:07:28] broken pieces. [music]
[2:07:30] He doesn't roll the cl away
[2:07:39] [music] over [singing]
[2:07:41] and over.
[2:07:44] He [music] moves me and makes me
[2:07:50] into [music]
[2:07:52] his likeness.
[2:07:55] passions [singing]
[2:07:57] of
[2:08:01] [music]
[2:08:03] that soul [singing]
[2:08:05] on earth
[2:08:08] I am [music]
[2:08:10] today
[2:08:12] and it's all because [music]
[2:08:16] Jesus
[2:08:18] didn't throw
[2:08:20] the clay way. [music]
[2:08:25] Oh, the soul [music and singing]
[2:08:29] of honor
[2:08:32] I am [music] today.
[2:08:37] And it's all [singing] because Jesus
[2:08:41] [music]
[2:08:42] didn't throw
[2:08:44] the clay away. [music]
[2:08:47] [singing]
[2:08:57] Thank you, Lord.
[2:09:02] [music]
[2:09:05] You can be seated. Just stay prayerful.
[2:09:07] If you want to be seated, you can.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; I'm [singing] forgiven
[2:09:16] because you were [music] forsaken.
[2:09:22] I'm [singing] accepted.
[2:09:26] You were condemned. [singing]
[2:09:29] [music]
[2:09:31] I'm alive and well. Your spirit
[2:09:34] [singing] is within me [music]
[2:09:38] because
[2:09:40] you died and [singing] rose again.
[2:09:45] [music]
[2:09:49] I'm [singing] forgiven
[2:09:51] [music] because you were forsaken.
[2:09:57] I'm accepted.
[2:10:00] You were condemned.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[2:10:03] [music]
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; I'm alive and well. Your spirit is
[2:10:09] [singing]
[2:10:10] within me [music]
[2:10:12] because
[2:10:13] you died and rose [singing]
[2:10:17] again.
[2:10:20] [music]
[2:10:21] Amazing love.
[2:10:24] How [singing]
[2:10:25] can it be
[2:10:29] that you, my king, [music and singing]
[2:10:31] would die
[2:10:33] for me.
[2:10:35] [music]
[2:10:37] Amazing love, [singing]
[2:10:40] I know it's true.
[2:10:45] [music] It's my joy to honor [singing]
[2:10:49] you
[2:10:51] in [music] all I do.
[2:10:55] I own.
[2:10:59] Oh,
[2:11:01] amazing [music and singing] love.
[2:11:04] How can it be [music]
[2:11:09] that you, my king, [singing] would die
[2:11:12] for [music] me.
[2:11:17] Amazing love
[2:11:19] I [singing] know [music]
[2:11:21] is true.
[2:11:25] It's my joy to honor [singing]
[2:11:28] you [music]
[2:11:30] in all I do.
[2:11:34] I [music] honor [singing]
