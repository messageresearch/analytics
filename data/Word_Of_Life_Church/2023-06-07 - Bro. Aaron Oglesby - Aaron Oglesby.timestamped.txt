[37:59] giant but like David like we're going to

[41:29] [Music]
[41:45] foreign
[42:12] [Applause]
[42:23] it's not just a good song It's a good
[42:25] principle
[42:27] whatever you're facing tonight
[42:29] doesn't really matter big little medium
[42:33] size you can bring all of your burdens
[42:36] to him and there's a secret cast all of
[42:39] your cares on him for he cares for you
[42:43] I remember an old song used to sing back
[42:45] in Pentecost years ago
[42:47] take your burden to the Lord
[42:49] and leave it there
[42:52] but we tend to take it and then pick it
[42:54] back up and take it back home don't we
[42:56] it's just that element about us humans
[42:59] it's so fearful to be able to totally
[43:01] trust the Lord
[43:03] I've never flown an airplane in my life
[43:05] and I'm too old to start learning now
[43:07] but every time I've ever been on one and
[43:09] got in turbulence I just have to be
[43:12] honest I wish I was in control
[43:14] I mean I just think I could do something
[43:16] I could be able to get us out of this
[43:18] mess that we're in but you know the end
[43:21] of that story I would have been history
[43:23] by now if I would have done that and
[43:25] it's the same way with the Lord whenever
[43:27] we Face things that we just think oh my
[43:29] goodness what in the world how is this
[43:31] going to out outcome going to be what's
[43:33] it going to do does anybody know of any
[43:36] battle tonight God's ever lost
[43:39] anybody
[43:43] none of us wow that'll be encouraging
[43:45] total silence
[43:48] so none of us tonight know of any battle
[43:49] that God has ever lost
[43:52] is there any one of his children
[43:54] that is ever forsaken
[43:57] no matter how wrong they were
[43:59] how weak they were has there ever been a
[44:01] time that he's not kept his word can
[44:04] anybody tell me of any instance God ever
[44:06] failed to keep his word
[44:08] wow
[44:09] there's not a governor a king a mayor a
[44:12] preacher a mama a daddy a nobody else
[44:15] that we could say that about
[44:18] so why is it we still get fearful
[44:20] but we do don't we we do
[44:23] and you know what he knew we would so
[44:26] this is why he himself experienced
[44:29] fear
[44:31] Jesus
[44:33] got afraid
[44:35] he got afraid
[44:38] because there's something about this
[44:40] flesh
[44:41] that gets afraid
[44:44] but I'm so glad that he allowed himself
[44:46] to be afraid
[44:48] so when I get afraid and you get afraid
[44:51] that we've got a high priest that we can
[44:53] go to and we can say you remember how
[44:55] you felt
[44:56] you remember how you were and you prayed
[45:00] to dodge the cross
[45:02] now I need you Lord aren't you glad we
[45:05] have such a king tonight
[45:07] God bless you we're so honored tonight
[45:09] brother Aaron to be back this way with
[45:11] us and we're just so thankful
[45:13] they went up to be the brother Ron this
[45:16] this weekend and I text him and ask him
[45:18] when this coming through again so we
[45:20] could be able to use him again so we're
[45:21] just so happy and so thankful so the
[45:24] Lord knows exactly what each of us need
[45:26] here tonight we want to just open our
[45:28] hearts and pull on the gift of God now
[45:31] don't worry about whether or not he
[45:33] studied according to what you need that
[45:36] really doesn't even matter
[45:38] here at the service Sunday morning the
[45:41] first 15 minutes I was totally and
[45:44] completely lost
[45:46] I had no idea where I was going where I
[45:49] was going I had no idea why I was going
[45:51] the direction I was going totally
[45:53] mesmerized
[45:55] and then after about 15 minutes
[45:57] something like that the Lord let me get
[45:59] back to where I thought I was supposed
[46:01] to be
[46:03] but you know what God has his way
[46:05] so no matter what you need is tonight
[46:07] brother Aaron mayor preached in a
[46:09] direction you announced it he announces
[46:11] Texas that oh no that ain't what I need
[46:13] don't worry pull him
[46:16] pull him
[46:18] in the direction that you need
[46:21] praise the Lord
[46:26] you see that's the thing that will never
[46:28] happen when you're listening to a tape
[46:32] I love tapes I listen to myself and if
[46:34] you don't you're doing wrong but you
[46:36] will never be able to pull the tape in
[46:40] the direction that you need to hear it
[46:42] never you just can't do it but a live
[46:45] gifted Ministry
[46:48] he may be preaching on the Millennium
[46:49] and you say I don't need the Millennium
[46:51] I need now I need right now I've got
[46:54] something I need and all of a sudden the
[46:56] spirit of God grabs a hold of him and
[46:57] he's just saying no no no no that's not
[47:00] my notes no I can't go that way
[47:03] but you have a need
[47:05] and God pulls you that way
[47:08] so whatever you need tonight
[47:10] let's just bring it before him
[47:12] open our hearts to the Lord
[47:14] let's just pray before our brother comes
[47:16] Heavenly Father
[47:18] we're so grateful you're that kind of a
[47:20] god
[47:21] we're asking you now Lord Jesus
[47:23] once again that you will just perform a
[47:26] miracle
[47:27] it is truly a miracle
[47:30] the prophet said one of the hardest
[47:32] things that you have to do is to get one
[47:37] mortal one human to believe another one
[47:41] so Lord God we're believing tonight that
[47:43] you are going to perform that once again
[47:46] you're going to take a mortal and anoint
[47:49] that mortal with your presence and be
[47:52] able to speak Words of Life words of
[47:55] Deliverance words of Peace whatever we
[47:59] need not only this visible audience but
[48:01] the invisible those that are sick those
[48:03] that are weary Lord God meet every need
[48:07] tonight we pray in the name of the Lord
[48:09] Jesus
[48:11] and the Saints said
[48:13] God bless you
[48:24] God bless you Saints it's wonderful to
[48:26] be with you again and just want to take
[48:29] the opportunity to say once again how
[48:31] much I appreciate brother Donnie and his
[48:34] ministry and
[48:35] how much I appreciate this congregation
[48:37] and many of you I've known for many many
[48:39] years and we've been coming to visit for
[48:42] many many years and we really love and
[48:44] appreciate you and we appreciate the
[48:46] friendships that we have here we
[48:47] appreciate your stand for the word amen
[48:49] and if you have your Bibles with you
[48:51] with you I don't want to
[48:52] um
[48:53] keep you standing long let's go ahead
[48:55] and turn we're going to look to
[48:56] Deuteronomy the seventh chapter
[48:59] as we get into the word
[49:01] and like brother Donnie said I just I
[49:03] pray that the Lord will take complete
[49:05] control and and get me out the way and
[49:08] allow allow him to have the preeminence
[49:10] in this service because
[49:12] we know that there's nothing that I
[49:14] could do or say that would benefit you
[49:16] in any way but when he comes and takes
[49:18] control when when he comes in anoints
[49:21] that's that's when things of Eternal
[49:23] value can take place amen
[49:25] amen so we're going to look in
[49:27] Deuteronomy the seventh chapter in the
[49:29] in the first verse and we'll read verses
[49:30] one two and three well actually we'll
[49:32] just read verses one and two right now
[49:34] it says in when the Lord thy God shall
[49:38] bring thee into the land wither thou
[49:41] goest to possess it and hath cast out
[49:44] many nations before Thee the Hittites
[49:47] and the gergisites and the amorites and
[49:49] the Canaanites and the parasites and the
[49:52] hivites and the jebusites Seven Nations
[49:54] greater and mightier than thou
[49:58] and when the Lord thy God shall deliver
[50:00] them before thee Thou shalt Smite them
[50:03] and utterly destroy them Thou shalt make
[50:07] no Covenant with them nor show Mercy
[50:10] unto them let's pray once again father
[50:13] we thank you so much for this
[50:14] opportunity Lord to gather with with
[50:16] Believers Lord and to be together but
[50:19] Lord what we're looking to now and
[50:20] asking now Lord is that you'll come and
[50:22] take control Lord every word Lord every
[50:25] thought Lord may it Lord find your
[50:27] perfect will and resting place tonight
[50:28] father Lord we're just asking that
[50:30] you'll not only remove me out of the way
[50:32] but the listeners will and allow us Lord
[50:34] God allow us Lord to allow the word to
[50:37] have an impact in our lives father we
[50:40] ask in Jesus name amen God bless you as
[50:43] you have your seats
[50:45] I'd like to speak to you for for a
[50:47] moment tonight on Total War for total
[50:50] victory Total War for total Victory and
[50:54] and what we're reading here I like how
[50:56] the Lord is speaking on on what he is
[51:00] going to do for Israel as they come into
[51:02] the promised land and what you'll find
[51:04] is he speaks very straightforward very
[51:07] matter-of-factly he doesn't operate in
[51:09] maybes he doesn't operate in in Hope
[51:11] so's because the difference between him
[51:14] and us is he doesn't have to wonder he
[51:17] already knows and sometimes we wonder
[51:18] how things are going to go and we wonder
[51:20] how things are going to turn out but God
[51:22] doesn't have to wonder he knows so
[51:25] because of that he can speak matter of
[51:27] fact and he can say when I bring you
[51:30] into the land and he can say and when
[51:33] the Lord shall deliver them before thee
[51:36] because this is this is how God operates
[51:38] when he speaks a word or when he
[51:40] whenever he makes a promise that word is
[51:43] going to come to pass it doesn't matter
[51:46] what he has to do it doesn't matter if
[51:48] he has to bankrupt Heaven move Nations
[51:50] bring down Empires whatever he has to do
[51:54] when he speaks a word it is going to
[51:57] come to pass we see that when he he told
[51:59] Abraham he said that your seed is going
[52:01] to sojourn in a Strange Land for 400
[52:04] years but after that they're going to be
[52:06] delivered and then not only am I going
[52:08] to deliver them but there's a land that
[52:10] already belongs to them that I'm going
[52:12] to take them to now when you look at all
[52:14] that there was a lot of things that
[52:16] stood in the way of the Fulfillment of
[52:18] all of that first of all Egypt was a
[52:21] mighty nation and they were slaves
[52:23] secondly there was a Red Sea and then
[52:26] thirdly they were going to need food and
[52:27] they were going to need water and then
[52:29] when they got there there was Jericho
[52:30] there was a lot of things that made it
[52:33] look as if it was impossible I'm sure
[52:35] there's a lot of things in your life
[52:36] tonight that makes the situation you're
[52:38] facing seem impossible I'm thankful that
[52:41] I can tell you tonight that we serve a
[52:43] god of impossibilities because even
[52:45] though they were slaves Egypt was
[52:47] brought to its knees even though there
[52:49] was a Red Sea in the way the Red Sea was
[52:51] wrong back oh they were going to need
[52:52] food so it rained down from heaven they
[52:54] were going to need water so it came out
[52:56] of a rock the the the Jordan River
[52:58] rolled back and the walls of Jericho
[53:01] crumbled because God had said you're
[53:03] going to be delivered I'm going to take
[53:05] you through and there's a land that
[53:07] you're going to possess and because he
[53:09] said it all of those things came to pass
[53:12] so whatever's in your way tonight
[53:14] whatever you're looking at tonight oh
[53:16] yeah there was a Red Sea in the way
[53:18] absolutely but he said he looked down
[53:20] through Angry Eyes through the pillar of
[53:22] fire and the Red Sea got scared and had
[53:25] to move out of the way that sickness
[53:27] tonight in your life he's looking at it
[53:29] tonight through the pillar of fire
[53:31] through Angry Eyes that situation facing
[53:34] your family he's looking tonight with
[53:36] Angry Eyes and it's going to move out of
[53:38] your way as is everything else is trying
[53:41] to hinder the Bride of Jesus Christ from
[53:43] taking a Rapture he's looking tonight
[53:45] with Angry Eyes and it's gonna roll out
[53:48] the way because it will not and cannot
[53:51] be stop because the word has been spoken
[53:54] Hallelujah
[53:57] Hallelujah
[53:59] once he has spoken it it will come to
[54:03] pass Amen brother Branham says that when
[54:06] he speaks a word he has to stay with it
[54:08] he said it's already confirmed in heaven
[54:12] you know we've said it before the only
[54:14] place that the word of God has debated
[54:16] is here
[54:18] it's not debated in heaven they know
[54:20] that it is good that it's going to be
[54:22] the truth it's going to come to pass
[54:23] amen
[54:25] amen you say well brother Aaron my
[54:27] problems are really starting to stack up
[54:30] join the club
[54:31] you are not special in that regard
[54:35] my problems are really beginning to
[54:37] stack up and the odds don't look so good
[54:40] well that's okay because God tells them
[54:42] here in the opening scripture he says
[54:44] there are seven Nations there that are
[54:47] mightier than you not just Seven Nations
[54:50] but each and every one of these nations
[54:52] on their own would whoop you but by the
[54:55] way you're not going to fight just one
[54:56] of them you're going to fight all seven
[54:59] of them but I want you to remember
[55:01] something the strength of our adversary
[55:03] only serves to magnify the strength of
[55:06] our God it's a big battle brother Aaron
[55:08] is tough that's okay it's going to be
[55:10] the greatest victory that you've ever
[55:12] experienced in your life it's only going
[55:14] to serve to magnify and lift up the
[55:17] testimony that our God is greater our
[55:19] God is not here that the battle is the
[55:22] Lord's listen it's his tonight I can't
[55:24] win it you can't win it when we get to
[55:26] the place that we recognize our backs
[55:28] against the wall there's nowhere else to
[55:30] turn just step on over to the Tree of
[55:33] Life keep going tonight his bad his
[55:36] street is sufficient in your battle I
[55:38] believe that with all my heart tonight
[55:40] whatever you're facing
[55:42] whatever you're facing
[55:44] and as soon as he lets them know that
[55:46] they're seven and that it's going to be
[55:48] impossible for them he says and when the
[55:52] Lord thy God shall deliver them before
[55:55] thee Thou shalt Smite them
[55:59] Thou shalt Smite them so whatever you're
[56:02] facing remember you've got a job to do
[56:05] you got a part to play in this Victory
[56:08] whatever you're facing today he goes on
[56:10] to say and when the Lord he says and the
[56:13] Lord
[56:14] shall deliver you
[56:16] listen he didn't bring you out to
[56:18] abandon you there's something that we
[56:20] always have to keep in mind that the
[56:22] same power that brought you out is the
[56:25] same power that's going to take you in
[56:27] there is a calling out and there is a
[56:29] taking in you may be in the wilderness
[56:31] today you may be struggling look for the
[56:34] rock look for The Rock You may be in the
[56:36] valley but there's water in your Valley
[56:37] he will sustain you he will keep you and
[56:40] he will take you across it's not just a
[56:44] calling out I'm thankful for the calling
[56:45] out but there's got to be a people that
[56:47] say I'm going in I'm not staying here
[56:50] I'm going in I'm going forward amen
[56:55] will it be easy
[56:57] not one inch of it
[57:00] not one inch of it's going to be easy
[57:03] I believe we all know that by now
[57:08] it's not going to be easy we're in a
[57:10] battle we're in a constant war and
[57:12] you're going to fight
[57:14] for every parcel of ground you take for
[57:17] every inch you gain
[57:20] and the Lord says little by little he's
[57:23] going to deliver them look sometimes you
[57:25] feel like you fight for a month you
[57:27] fight for six months you fight for a
[57:29] year and boy I bet I've made great
[57:31] progress I'm so much farther along
[57:36] three feet
[57:41] but let me tell you something that three
[57:43] feet was worth gaining that three feet
[57:45] was worth fighting for because it's
[57:47] three feet that the devil don't have
[57:49] that means I took more listen why is he
[57:51] after you why is he fighting because he
[57:53] wants the ground that you got so I'll
[57:55] tell you if he wants it it's worth
[57:57] fighting for it's a position worth
[57:59] holding stand there tonight say no it's
[58:02] mine and not only is this mine but I'm
[58:04] gonna take more I'm gonna possess more
[58:06] I'm gonna gain more ground we gotta keep
[58:10] me moving forward ever moving forward
[58:12] never giving up ground but fighting for
[58:15] more
[58:18] Ray Brown says now Satan will constantly
[58:21] punch at you until you're finished here
[58:23] on the earth just remember that you'll
[58:26] never have a time but when there's a
[58:28] punch going on all the time because
[58:31] you're in a battle did you ask to come
[58:33] to Christ to to go on a picnic well
[58:36] you're sure going to be surprised
[58:39] because it's a constant battle
[58:42] listen I don't want to be the bearer of
[58:44] bad news but the world is not getting
[58:45] better
[58:47] things are not getting better it's
[58:49] getting worse day by day by day and
[58:52] there's no turning this train around
[58:53] it's a runaway train and it's going down
[58:56] it's been prophesied to go down but
[58:58] that's okay because in that same
[59:00] prophecy there's a bride that goes up it
[59:02] may be going down but there's somebody
[59:04] elevating there's somebody Rising
[59:06] there's somebody gaining new heights
[59:07] each and every day and that's where I
[59:09] identify I'm not on this runaway train
[59:12] I'm not going down this way we got off
[59:14] that train it reminds me of sometimes
[59:17] you hear people say well yeah brother
[59:18] Branham was a god-called man but he got
[59:20] off at this point and he got off at that
[59:22] point I say you're exactly right and I
[59:24] got off with him I got off that train
[59:26] that was going the wrong way I got off
[59:28] that train that was going to a
[59:30] tribulation and I got over on the glory
[59:32] Express and it's going to take me out of
[59:34] here this Train's going in a Rapture
[59:36] this world may be running the wrong way
[59:39] but there's a people that's got a ticket
[59:41] they've got a token it's been purchased
[59:43] with the blood of Jesus and we'll ride
[59:45] this train all the way to a body change
[59:48] Hallelujah
[59:51] Hallelujah
[59:54] and while we're here it ain't gonna get
[59:56] no easier
[59:57] the devil's attacks aren't going away
[59:59] and you're going to be punched at until
[1:00:01] you're finished here
[1:00:03] but I'm not worried about it
[1:00:06] I'm not worried about it because God is
[1:00:08] a god of Total War
[1:00:10] he is a man of war and he is determined
[1:00:13] that your Victory will be won by any
[1:00:16] means necessary that's his attitude
[1:00:18] towards the battle any means necessary
[1:00:22] whatever it takes listen our God is All
[1:00:25] In
[1:00:25] he's all in but what he wants is a
[1:00:28] people that are all in not half in half
[1:00:31] out maybe this maybe that God whatever
[1:00:33] it takes whatever I gotta surrender
[1:00:35] wherever you need me to be whatever your
[1:00:38] word says I'll line up to it because I'm
[1:00:40] all in tonight I don't want this right
[1:00:42] here guiding me I don't want this right
[1:00:44] here it lead me I don't want to depend
[1:00:46] on this right here to win the battle but
[1:00:49] God I'm all in for whatever your battle
[1:00:51] plan says whatever your word says I'm
[1:00:54] all in tonight I give you everything
[1:00:56] tonight I lay it all of us I miss it
[1:00:58] I've got in trouble a lot in my life and
[1:01:00] it was always when I made decisions
[1:01:02] based off what I thought was good for me
[1:01:04] emotional irrational in the moment well
[1:01:07] this is what's best
[1:01:09] every time I've never got in trouble by
[1:01:12] letting the Lord lead me I've never gone
[1:01:14] astray letting the Lord lead me I say
[1:01:16] tonight Lord lead me where you want me
[1:01:19] maybe this job looks great maybe this
[1:01:22] college looks great but if it ain't what
[1:01:24] God wants for you it ain't great I can
[1:01:26] tell you that
[1:01:28] lean a hundred percent into him because
[1:01:30] listen I'm batting zero on decisions
[1:01:33] I've made
[1:01:35] I've been put on the bench
[1:01:39] but when I let him step up to the plate
[1:01:41] for me I'm batting a thousand every
[1:01:44] single time it works out in my favor the
[1:01:46] difference is let me tell you this
[1:01:48] because as humans there's an instinct in
[1:01:50] US of self-preservation
[1:01:53] we make a decision that's best for us in
[1:01:56] that moment God don't make decisions
[1:01:58] based off of this moment his decisions
[1:02:01] are Eternal decisions and because we're
[1:02:03] basing it off the moment we can't see
[1:02:05] beyond the moment and we're making
[1:02:07] decisions that may be right in that
[1:02:09] moment sustain us but he's making
[1:02:12] decisions for your Eternal good that's
[1:02:15] why you look at a scripture that says
[1:02:16] all things work together for good and
[1:02:18] I'm going there's no way
[1:02:21] there is no way that this is for my good
[1:02:23] but he's not looking at now he's not
[1:02:26] even looking at next week he's going to
[1:02:28] make everything work together for your
[1:02:30] Eternal good for the good of your soul
[1:02:33] so on that day on that day not this day
[1:02:36] but on that day you can look and go it
[1:02:39] was for my good it was for my good I got
[1:02:43] here because he worked it for my good
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:50] he wants us totally committed
[1:02:52] totally surrendered
[1:02:54] from our own thoughts
[1:02:56] from our own ideas
[1:02:59] from what Mom and Daddy's ideas were
[1:03:02] he wants to where we can completely
[1:03:04] surrender to his ideas listen we get in
[1:03:07] the way of our Victory about as much as
[1:03:09] the devil does
[1:03:12] that poor devil takes a beating
[1:03:13] sometimes for stuff you did wrong
[1:03:16] well the devil and the devil and the
[1:03:18] devil will get
[1:03:20] you talking Mighty ugly about yourself
[1:03:22] because this is decisions you made
[1:03:24] you're standing in a place that you put
[1:03:26] yourself
[1:03:27] [Applause]
[1:03:30] think about it
[1:03:32] Lay Your Ideas aside lay them down and
[1:03:36] say Lord lead me let me get out of the
[1:03:38] way let my pride get out of the way let
[1:03:41] my ideas get out of the way anything
[1:03:43] contrary to the word of God let me get
[1:03:46] it out of the way so that I can have
[1:03:48] total Victory amen
[1:03:50] what do you say there at the end of our
[1:03:52] opening verse he said Thou shalt Smite
[1:03:54] them and utterly destroy them Thou shalt
[1:03:58] make no Covenant with them nor show
[1:04:00] Mercy unto them
[1:04:03] we have to get to the place that we
[1:04:04] recognize we're not playing games
[1:04:07] that we're not pampering stuff and we're
[1:04:09] not babying stuff listen when's the last
[1:04:11] time the devil took it easy on you
[1:04:14] when's the last time he took it easy on

[1:07:03] you're hiding in the tent but somebody's
[1:07:05] gonna go down into the valley brother
[1:07:07] Branham said his boast fell on the wrong
[1:07:09] ears that day there was a new set of
[1:07:11] ears in the camp and there's a new set
[1:07:13] of people on the Earth today it says I
[1:07:15] won't be beat down I won't have to cope
[1:07:17] with it I won't live with it but I'm

[1:07:32] it's warm
[1:07:42] brother Brown says what we need is
[1:07:43] old-fashioned God sent heaven-born
[1:07:45] preachers
[1:07:46] who will tell the truth regardless who
[1:07:48] it hurts
[1:07:49] like John who said the ax has laid to
[1:07:51] the root of the tree and every tree that
[1:07:54] not bringeth forth good fruits is Hume
[1:07:56] down and cast Into the Fire we need
[1:07:58] preachers prophets like that who will
[1:08:00] bombard and use the judgments of God for
[1:08:03] ammunition to tear up this wicked
[1:08:06] condition that we're living in you can
[1:08:08] never rid sin by patting it on the back
[1:08:11] you can never read sin by educating
[1:08:14] people our programs has become
[1:08:16] demolished and have failed there's only
[1:08:18] one remedy for sin and that is Christ is
[1:08:21] that remedy and not Christ through
[1:08:24] intellectual confession but through the
[1:08:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost to a new life
[1:08:29] and a regeneration that's the only
[1:08:31] remedy for sin only remedy for our
[1:08:34] nation it's the only remedy for our
[1:08:36] church it's the only remedy for the
[1:08:39] people
[1:08:40] Total War
[1:08:42] the new birth
[1:08:44] foreign
[1:08:45] he said there in verse 2 to utterly
[1:08:47] destroy
[1:08:49] what does destroy mean
[1:08:53] destroy means to put an end to the
[1:08:55] existence of
[1:08:57] of something by attacking it
[1:09:00] synonyms consume Crush dismantle and
[1:09:05] eradicate gut kill shatter smash wipe
[1:09:10] out this is what you are supposed to be
[1:09:13] doing to the enemy smashing wipe him out
[1:09:16] gutting good him I kind of like that one
[1:09:19] that sounds violent yep war is violent I
[1:09:21] say tonight we gut the enemy come out of
[1:09:24] here with Victory let him know I ain't
[1:09:26] backing up I ain't scared of you if
[1:09:28] there's anybody in the building tonight
[1:09:30] ought to be scared it's the devil in
[1:09:32] those Minions that showed up on the
[1:09:34] wrong night in the wrong place and their
[1:09:36] boats fell on the wrong ears I'm telling
[1:09:38] you tonight we're not taking prisoners
[1:09:40] we're not giving quarter we have come to
[1:09:43] be Victorious and take his head off hey
[1:09:46] it only takes one it only takes one and
[1:09:48] the rest to look and go if he can do it
[1:09:50] we can do it too brother Branham said
[1:09:52] they cut Philistines all day long pushed
[1:09:55] him against the wall and had them a big
[1:09:56] Slaughter I say we Slaughter some demons
[1:09:59] tonight
[1:10:00] don't make a deal don't leave here with
[1:10:03] it don't leave here with the Tormentor
[1:10:05] meeting tonight and declare war on him
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:10] it says that when he come and fought
[1:10:12] against them and taken from the people
[1:10:14] then God told him told Israel or Israel
[1:10:16] vowed to God if he would deliver the
[1:10:19] kingdom to his hands that he utterly
[1:10:21] destroyed the land and that's a type
[1:10:24] today if God will give you the spirit
[1:10:26] the Holy Spirit utterly destroy sin out
[1:10:30] of your life move on nothing can stop
[1:10:34] the church
[1:10:35] nothing
[1:10:37] can stop the church
[1:10:39] listen I understand that there's times
[1:10:41] that we're attacked
[1:10:43] to where we have to we have to defend
[1:10:46] our position where we have to hold where
[1:10:48] we have to withstand I I understand that
[1:10:51] but there's also a go and take it aspect
[1:10:54] of this battle
[1:10:56] there's a go and and take it part
[1:10:58] there's a time where you go and take the
[1:11:01] land where you go destroy the Destroyer
[1:11:04] where you go on the offensive
[1:11:07] you you don't just sit back on the
[1:11:09] defense listen I understand that we need
[1:11:11] a good defense we need to keep up the
[1:11:13] the armor and guard the door and all
[1:11:15] those things but Joshua could have had
[1:11:17] the best defensive encampment in history
[1:11:20] guarding the post sitting out there
[1:11:22] watching Jericho and stayed there and
[1:11:24] he'd have never took the land
[1:11:27] there Comes A Time of going and taking

[1:11:33] Rockets over into our camp and just said
[1:11:35] hunker down bucker down boys hold hold
[1:11:38] there comes a point where we load it up
[1:11:41] and start launching Rockets back at him

[1:11:46] his stripes I am healed grab a hold of a
[1:11:49] rocket tonight whatever you need the joy
[1:11:52] of the Lord is your strength load it up
[1:11:54] and launch it at the enemy tonight and
[1:11:57] go on the attack and take back some of
[1:11:59] the things he's taken from you
[1:12:05] he had to move forward to possess
[1:12:08] Joshua was on the attack
[1:12:10] amen
[1:12:12] and by going on the attack
[1:12:13] that meant he made footsteps
[1:12:16] he was taken he was making footsteps and
[1:12:18] tonight you got to start making
[1:12:20] footsteps toward what it is you need
[1:12:22] start making footsteps towards your
[1:12:24] Victory listen walk in it walk on it

[1:12:42] take another step but it's such a far
[1:12:44] Journey you'll never get there without
[1:12:46] taking the first step and then take
[1:12:49] another step and another step and
[1:12:51] eventually you're going to step right
[1:12:52] into the victory that he called you to
[1:12:54] but you won't get it sitting still
[1:12:56] tonight you got to go forward you gotta
[1:12:59] go take it get out of the Foxhole and
[1:13:02] charge the enemy tonight
[1:13:04] Hallelujah

[1:13:08] go get the victory
[1:13:10] what is it that David said he said this
[1:13:12] day will the Lord deliver thee into mine
[1:13:15] hand and I will smite thee and take
[1:13:18] thine head from thee
[1:13:21] I saw the son of Kiss he said ah let's
[1:13:23] hang out in the tent
[1:13:25] the days of Miracles is over
[1:13:28] that says that we're just going to have
[1:13:29] to let that that that devil walk around
[1:13:31] there and there that we can't cast out
[1:13:33] depression have you seen the size of
[1:13:36] that pornography devil

[1:13:41] hurt your family
[1:13:43] and um and when you think about that and
[1:13:46] relate that pain
[1:13:48] and then begin to
[1:13:51] come on Saul
[1:13:53] come on
[1:13:55] it's not time to be a sons of Kish
[1:13:58] no it's time to act like somebody that's
[1:13:59] been anointed by the prophet to go into
[1:14:02] the valley and take the enemy's head off
[1:14:03] tonight it's time to go on the attack

[1:14:16] hallelujah how many believes in that
[1:14:18] that you can be refilled once again Amen
[1:14:20] brother Brown said the Dynamics of this
[1:14:23] church will be a refilling of the Holy
[1:14:25] Ghost don't let me hinder that Lord pour
[1:14:28] it out on me tonight I need another
[1:14:30] refilling I need more courage I need
[1:14:32] more joy I need more peace I don't want
[1:14:34] to be a coward I don't want to be found
[1:14:36] hiding but tonight Lord let me declare
[1:14:39] war on the enemy let me go forward and
[1:14:42] take it tonight amen
[1:14:44] hey man
[1:14:46] Deuteronomy 12 1.
[1:14:49] I said these are the statutes and
[1:14:51] judgments which you you shall observe to
[1:14:54] do in the land which the Lord God of thy
[1:14:55] fathers giveth thee to possess
[1:14:58] possess it all the days that you live
[1:15:00] upon the Earth ye shall utterly destroy
[1:15:03] all the places wherein the Nations which
[1:15:05] you shall possess serve their gods upon
[1:15:08] the high mountains and upon the hills
[1:15:09] and under every Green Tree and you shall
[1:15:12] overthrow their altars and break their
[1:15:14] pillars and burn their Groves with fire
[1:15:16] and you shall Hew down the grave and
[1:15:18] images of their gods and destroy the
[1:15:20] names of them out of that place
[1:15:24] now as I read that I didn't find
[1:15:26] anywhere where they made any kind of
[1:15:27] deals
[1:15:29] there were no treaties signed
[1:15:31] to where well if we give you this and
[1:15:33] you give us he said destroy them
[1:15:36] he said destroy the places they serve
[1:15:38] their gods and he said burn their Groves
[1:15:41] with fire
[1:15:42] well surely
[1:15:44] brother Aaron if we if we'll just listen
[1:15:46] to him
[1:15:47] and listen what it is they have to say
[1:15:49] and maybe we can find places where we
[1:15:50] can we can draw some things from the way
[1:15:52] they do you know and and maybe we can
[1:15:54] help you know mutually benefit one
[1:15:57] another and and you know maybe we if we
[1:15:59] would quit being so harsh about certain
[1:16:01] things and if we'd back off just a
[1:16:03] little bit then maybe we could win more
[1:16:04] in
[1:16:05] burn it
[1:16:08] burn it cast it down destroy it don't
[1:16:12] even leave their names in the place burn
[1:16:14] the thing to the ground this is total
[1:16:16] war it is reality we're not to pamper
[1:16:20] things
[1:16:20] [Applause]
[1:16:24] I kind of have a reputation
[1:16:28] we're talking a lot about history
[1:16:30] so here we go
[1:16:34] during the American Civil War there were
[1:16:37] you know there was wonderful men on both
[1:16:39] sides of that war
[1:16:41] and there were some awful men on both
[1:16:42] sides of that war
[1:16:45] but two Central characters that will be
[1:16:47] names you recognize just to compare and
[1:16:49] contrast for a moment was General Robert
[1:16:51] E Lee
[1:16:53] General William Sherman
[1:16:56] you know Robert E Lee was widely
[1:16:58] considered as one of the greatest
[1:17:00] strategists in the entire war and if not
[1:17:03] only in that war but of any war and many
[1:17:06] of his battle plans are still studied
[1:17:07] today and because of how bold they were
[1:17:10] how swift they were how daring they were
[1:17:12] and and yet
[1:17:14] General Lee was a gentleman
[1:17:16] to everyone
[1:17:18] even to his enemies
[1:17:20] and you know we look at that and we
[1:17:22] admire that because he was a good man
[1:17:25] but he was at War
[1:17:28] understand that he was he was at at War
[1:17:30] and
[1:17:31] when they invaded the north up into
[1:17:33] Pennsylvania the Army had strict
[1:17:35] instructions and this just kind of shows
[1:17:37] the kind of man that he was and they
[1:17:39] were told do not interfere with the
[1:17:41] lives of civilians at all do not damage
[1:17:44] the property of the civilians we are not
[1:17:46] at war with with the civilians we want
[1:17:48] them to see that we mean them no harm
[1:17:52] even to the point
[1:17:54] that there are stories and I understand
[1:17:56] that down through time stories become
[1:17:57] exaggerated and whatnot but there are
[1:17:59] stories of men receiving severe
[1:18:01] punishment for tearing down split rail
[1:18:05] fences so they could have firewood at
[1:18:07] night and not freeze
[1:18:08] and he would come in and the order was
[1:18:11] though not to destroy any property so
[1:18:13] even for the sake of firewood they would
[1:18:16] receive punishment and things like that
[1:18:18] and then on the other end of this
[1:18:19] spectrum is General Sherman
[1:18:22] we all know about General Sherman and I
[1:18:24] gotta I gotta admit it's kind of hard to
[1:18:26] preach a sermon where you kind of make
[1:18:28] Sherman the good guy especially in this
[1:18:30] part of the world
[1:18:32] but General Sherman
[1:18:34] other men had tried to outmaneuver the
[1:18:36] southern armies
[1:18:38] other men had had the gentleman's
[1:18:40] approach
[1:18:41] they had fought a pretty War a poetic
[1:18:43] War a war of pageantry
[1:18:47] I mean you know how it is a war where
[1:18:48] people don't weep their way to Calvary
[1:18:50] anymore
[1:18:52] a war where there's no prayer lines in a
[1:18:54] war where you don't you know you don't
[1:18:55] you know
[1:18:58] you definitely don't want somebody to
[1:18:59] shake out a bobby pin
[1:19:02] you know just the forms of a church
[1:19:04] service and we've gathered for battle
[1:19:06] but but really are we
[1:19:09] you're a pretty War a poetic War you
[1:19:12] know a war where sin isn't called out
[1:19:13] from the pulpit anymore and
[1:19:16] and this is the kind of War as it was
[1:19:17] that the union was fighting it was known
[1:19:19] as a war of conciliation
[1:19:21] a limited War it's the idea that most of
[1:19:25] the people on the enemy side really
[1:19:27] aren't our enemies you know what I mean
[1:19:30] by that like this really isn't a bad
[1:19:33] thing this is a family trait
[1:19:35] you know my daddy had a temper and it
[1:19:37] just runs in our family and this is this
[1:19:39] is how we are it's not really that big a
[1:19:41] deal
[1:19:42] I'm just turned a little bit negative
[1:19:44] it's just my nature it's not really my
[1:19:46] enemy
[1:19:47] well I have a right to be bitter they
[1:19:49] hurt me and this ain't something I need
[1:19:51] to let go of they need to fix this
[1:19:54] it's a war where you don't really
[1:19:56] recognize who the enemy is so I'll
[1:19:58] eventually grow out of this we'll
[1:20:00] eventually overwhelm the South without
[1:20:02] with our numbers
[1:20:03] and Sherman realized in all of that the
[1:20:06] war was not getting won
[1:20:08] they try to outstrategize him they tried
[1:20:10] to outmaneuver him they try to fight a
[1:20:12] pretty war and they were getting beat on
[1:20:14] every Battlefield
[1:20:17] so in 1863 he began to apply what he
[1:20:21] called the hard hand of War
[1:20:24] and he did this in central Mississippi
[1:20:26] in the Meridian campaign and for the
[1:20:28] first time Sherman would order his
[1:20:31] troops to wage a war of Destruction
[1:20:36] says here it says Sherman's goal was to
[1:20:38] make Georgia howl we are not only
[1:20:40] fighting hostile armies but a hostile
[1:20:42] people and we must make old young rich
[1:20:46] and poor feel the hard hand of War we
[1:20:49] cannot change the hearts and minds of
[1:20:51] those people of the South but we can
[1:20:53] make war so terrible and make them so
[1:20:56] sick of war that Generations will pass
[1:20:58] away before they would again appeal to
[1:21:00] it German contended that the United
[1:21:02] States and its Representatives had the
[1:21:05] right to remove and Destroy every
[1:21:08] obstacle if need be take every life
[1:21:10] every acre of land every particle of
[1:21:13] property everything that to us seems
[1:21:16] proper and that all who do not Aid are
[1:21:19] enemies and we will not account to them
[1:21:23] for our Acts
[1:21:25] that seems harsh
[1:21:27] and yet I take from that and I go
[1:21:29] perfect
[1:21:30] that is absolutely perfect it's time we
[1:21:33] destroy whatever we have to destroy act
[1:21:35] however we have to act listen he says we
[1:21:38] don't have to give account to people for
[1:21:40] how we conduct this War I think it's
[1:21:42] time we quit worrying about how people
[1:21:43] think or worry about how we conduct our
[1:21:46] church services I'm not here to worry
[1:21:48] about it being pretty I ain't here to
[1:21:50] worry about it offending somebody I
[1:21:52] ain't worried if you think it's out of
[1:21:53] order I'm here to win I'm here to be
[1:21:56] victorious we will do whatever it takes
[1:21:58] if somebody's got to run to get free run
[1:22:00] I don't care whatever you got to do win
[1:22:04] win win sermons and I don't care about
[1:22:07] all that stuff we've Church ordered long
[1:22:09] enough and the battle ain't getting won
[1:22:11] he said let's tear it up tear it up if
[1:22:14] it's in the way of your Victory burn it
[1:22:16] down if it's in the way of your joy burn
[1:22:18] it down if it's in the way of the Holy
[1:22:21] Ghost Burn It Down
[1:22:23] sometimes things get in our way there
[1:22:25] was a lot of people in the way of those
[1:22:27] four men trying to get somebody to Jesus
[1:22:28] and they couldn't get in so they tore
[1:22:30] the roof off the place they took
[1:22:32] Sherman's tactics we're gonna do
[1:22:34] whatever we got to do and tear up
[1:22:37] whatever we gotta tear up but we're
[1:22:39] gonna win we're gonna get to Jesus we're
[1:22:41] gonna push through it doesn't matter
[1:22:43] what anybody else thinks I am here to
[1:22:48] win
[1:22:49] Hallelujah we got to get the attitude
[1:22:52] that we're here
[1:22:54] to win
[1:22:55] he was no longer concerned with people's
[1:22:57] feelings
[1:22:59] and what they thought proper
[1:23:01] sometimes I think we've Church our
[1:23:03] church ordered
[1:23:05] the Holy Spirit right out of some
[1:23:06] services
[1:23:08] he was concerned
[1:23:10] with winning
[1:23:12] brother Brown says God help us to get
[1:23:14] out of order once in a while
[1:23:18] the Trump you know some
[1:23:20] I don't know brother Donnie maybe this
[1:23:22] is a seed that we can all just spit out
[1:23:23] and that's okay if it is
[1:23:25] but he's mostly preaching to Pentecostal
[1:23:28] people
[1:23:30] the people that we think didn't have no
[1:23:32] church order
[1:23:33] that was a you know
[1:23:35] a little out of control a lot of
[1:23:36] wildfire and he's telling them God help
[1:23:38] us to get out of order once in a while
[1:23:41] what would he say to us
[1:23:46] he says the trouble of it is you got too
[1:23:48] much order
[1:23:51] I bet it cost us
[1:23:54] get out of order I hope the church gets
[1:23:57] out of order long enough to get saved
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:00] [Applause]
[1:24:02] that's what Sherman did he got out of
[1:24:04] order this wasn't how you were supposed
[1:24:05] to fight a war
[1:24:09] I'm not worried about what everything
[1:24:10] has done and how everybody thinks we
[1:24:12] should operate if it stands in the way
[1:24:14] of Victory we're going to burn it down
[1:24:17] that's exactly how Sherman begin to just
[1:24:19] fight we got to get to that place any
[1:24:21] idea any ISM any division any family
[1:24:24] thing we've held on to for so long that
[1:24:26] we think is so important if it's
[1:24:28] hindering you or your family get rid of
[1:24:31] it tonight
[1:24:32] get rid of it because it's not worth
[1:24:34] losing the battle it's not worth it do
[1:24:37] you think right now if Sherman can stand
[1:24:39] here he would care what his reputation
[1:24:41] was he'd say I won
[1:24:44] I'm sorry you hate me but I won I'm
[1:24:47] sorry I burned everything now listen I
[1:24:49] look right at the Devil and say you can
[1:24:51] hate me all you want but I'm winning I'm
[1:24:54] winning you can look at me and say well
[1:24:56] you're a little fanatical okay but I'm
[1:24:58] winning I'm taking a Rapture and maybe
[1:25:01] you don't gotta act like me that's fine
[1:25:03] but I'm gonna do whatever I gotta do to
[1:25:06] win it's total war for total victory
[1:25:11] all right
[1:25:20] Deuteronomy 2016.
[1:25:23] but of the cities of these people which
[1:25:24] the Lord thy God doth give thee for an
[1:25:26] inheritance Thou shalt save alive
[1:25:29] nothing that breatheth
[1:25:33] wow
[1:25:35] anything
[1:25:37] that has stood on your inheritance
[1:25:39] notice
[1:25:40] they had stood on the inheritance that
[1:25:42] they were going to possess
[1:25:44] anything that has stood on your
[1:25:46] inheritance spare none of it
[1:25:48] anything that has tried to stop you
[1:25:50] anything that has tried to hinder you or
[1:25:52] or made you think that you couldn't have
[1:25:54] it
[1:25:55] spare none of it
[1:25:57] don't spare anything
[1:25:59] verse 17 but Thou shalt utterly destroy
[1:26:02] them namely the Hittites and the
[1:26:04] amorites and the Canaanites the
[1:26:05] parasites the hivites the jebusites as
[1:26:08] the Lord thy God had commanded thee
[1:26:12] brother Brown says listen destroy your
[1:26:14] enemy before your enemy destroys you
[1:26:16] he'll do it bring back the old-fashioned
[1:26:19] meetings in the thing and oh leave
[1:26:21] Delilah alone leave the world alone in
[1:26:23] that thing that Woos you off into little
[1:26:25] things you shouldn't the little things
[1:26:28] troubles come up in the church and you
[1:26:30] won't stand correction because you don't
[1:26:31] have to
[1:26:35] you can drop off to another church and
[1:26:38] things like that in the early days when
[1:26:40] a man when a man didn't cope up with the
[1:26:42] word of God they packed him out dead
[1:26:46] I thank God for every single church we
[1:26:48] got there's a quote where brother Brown
[1:26:49] says something to the forgive me I'm
[1:26:51] paraphrase that there's
[1:26:53] um booze joints on every corner we need
[1:26:55] to put a church on every corner I'm
[1:26:57] thankful for every Church there is but
[1:26:59] it's also created a situation to where
[1:27:01] oh he stepped on my toes well I can go
[1:27:02] to this church and he stepped on my toes
[1:27:05] here so I can go to this church and you
[1:27:06] create a whole generation of of message
[1:27:09] rabbits
[1:27:10] because they're Church Hoppers that's
[1:27:12] all they want to do and hop from this
[1:27:13] church and hop to that church and you
[1:27:15] know what they teach their kids you
[1:27:16] don't have to be corrected you don't
[1:27:17] have to let the word correct you you
[1:27:18] don't have to believe the man of God's
[1:27:20] anointed you don't have to believe none
[1:27:21] of that if he hurts your feelings just
[1:27:23] quit just give up just move somewhere
[1:27:25] where they won't hurt your feelings
[1:27:29] I don't know maybe that's not something
[1:27:30] you deal with here but it was just it is
[1:27:32] in the quote so we preached it for a
[1:27:34] second
[1:27:37] he says if in the old days if a man
[1:27:40] didn't cope up with the word of God they
[1:27:41] packed him out dead bring us back to
[1:27:44] Pentecost not Hollywood Showmanship but
[1:27:47] a wholehearted turn to God is what we
[1:27:49] need once more Lord oh once more he says
[1:27:52] in another place let me say this friend
[1:27:54] you better destroy your enemy before
[1:27:57] your enemy destroys you now we're going
[1:28:00] to turn this
[1:28:01] a little bit for a moment
[1:28:03] because
[1:28:04] people love this statement
[1:28:07] they love oh yeah destroy your enemy
[1:28:09] before it destroys you they get behind
[1:28:11] that people will rally behind that
[1:28:12] statement they have no problem with it
[1:28:14] but what they have a problem with
[1:28:16] is recognizing the enemy
[1:28:21] oh yeah destroy your enemy destroy your
[1:28:23] enemy
[1:28:25] look in the mirror
[1:28:31] you got to be able to recognize your
[1:28:33] enemy and so they toy with things that
[1:28:36] they should be destroying they toy with
[1:28:38] pride they toy with unbelief they toy
[1:28:41] with complexes they toy with
[1:28:42] unforgiveness they toy with bitterness
[1:28:45] they toy with Rebellion not recognizing
[1:28:48] that those things aren't to be toyed
[1:28:50] with they are the enemy and they want to
[1:28:52] destroy you they want to kill you they
[1:28:56] want to rob you they want to see you
[1:28:58] miss the Rapture that's what they're
[1:28:59] doing if the people refuse to recognize
[1:29:02] the enemy
[1:29:03] and that's the thing about Total War
[1:29:06] is it recognizes the uncomfortable
[1:29:09] enemies
[1:29:11] Sherman was willing to look at the
[1:29:13] people oh and say they're the enemy
[1:29:18] well Sherman what have they done
[1:29:22] they raise cattle that feeds the army
[1:29:24] these railroad tracks takes the cattle
[1:29:26] to the Army
[1:29:28] and we are listen everybody wants to say
[1:29:29] yeah destroy the devil destroy the devil
[1:29:31] destroy the Devil because it's obvious
[1:29:34] listen you got two great enemies the
[1:29:36] devil and you
[1:29:38] and it's debatable which one's the worst
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:44] it is a tight race
[1:29:46] sometimes on Mondays I think it's me
[1:29:52] it's a tight race
[1:29:54] who's your worst enemy the devil or
[1:29:57] yourself
[1:29:58] but Total War recognizes the
[1:30:01] uncomfortable enemies it recognizes that
[1:30:04] little Devils grow up to be big Devils
[1:30:07] that little attitudes grow up to be big
[1:30:10] attitudes that a little Rebellion turns
[1:30:12] into a lot of rebellion that I can do
[1:30:15] away with that word turns into I can do
[1:30:17] away with that sermon
[1:30:20] and then you step off on a slippery
[1:30:22] slope and all of a sudden how did I get
[1:30:24] here you didn't deal with the
[1:30:26] uncomfortable enemies in your life you
[1:30:28] didn't deal with the root of bitterness
[1:30:29] you didn't deal with your pride you
[1:30:31] didn't deal with family Cycles you
[1:30:33] didn't deal with you
[1:30:35] oh the devil the devil the devil deal
[1:30:38] with yourself deal with the Enemy
[1:30:42] recognize it tonight
[1:30:48] he says after a while when Joshua took
[1:30:50] the land God told him utterly destroy
[1:30:51] everything there is don't leave nothing
[1:30:53] why could you imagine some of them
[1:30:55] Israelite women picking up a little baby
[1:30:57] oh isn't this cute look at it ain't even
[1:31:01] got teeth yet Joshua said kill it
[1:31:07] the mother said oh I'm a mother
[1:31:09] I can't kill a baby Josh Joshua said
[1:31:12] hand it here
[1:31:15] I'll kill it
[1:31:18] hand it here why it might look cute now
[1:31:21] but it'll grow up and be just like his
[1:31:23] daddy you can't baby sin it's got to be
[1:31:27] handled not with gloves on but
[1:31:29] bare-handed
[1:31:32] well I don't understand why that's so
[1:31:34] wrong brother Aaron
[1:31:36] I don't understand why I'm not allowed
[1:31:37] to have an opinion
[1:31:39] why is it that that even really matters
[1:31:41] why did Brother Branham have to say it
[1:31:43] that way
[1:31:44] well you know that's just the way I am
[1:31:46] and I I don't think oh boy
[1:31:51] well I don't understand oh boy
[1:31:55] well you know I think if we now we're
[1:31:57] getting into the uncomfortable enemies
[1:32:00] we're getting to the place that we don't
[1:32:01] really like to talk about you see
[1:32:03] everybody wants to kill the devil
[1:32:05] because he's the obvious enemy
[1:32:08] that's just obvious everybody believes
[1:32:11] the quote destroy your enemy before it
[1:32:12] destroys you
[1:32:14] but how many of us like to really
[1:32:16] identify where the enemy is
[1:32:18] and so because it can't be
[1:32:22] uh it can't be us
[1:32:23] that'll be
[1:32:27] or it's got to be brother Donnie
[1:32:31] it's got to be those mean Deacons
[1:32:36] or people really fall off the rails and
[1:32:37] it's got to be brother Louie's fault
[1:32:42] because the devil ain't gonna never let
[1:32:44] you aim the gun at you so what do you do
[1:32:46] you aiming at everybody else it must be
[1:32:48] them it must be their fault they're the
[1:32:50] reason and them and this and this and
[1:32:52] because you're so busy firing your
[1:32:53] weapons out there you never one time get
[1:32:55] them trained where they should be
[1:32:57] trained and that's on the devil and on
[1:32:59] and on your flesh this right here this
[1:33:02] right here has got to be dealt with this
[1:33:04] right here has got to be put under the
[1:33:05] blood this right here has got to come
[1:33:07] under the token this right here is your
[1:33:11] enemy
[1:33:12] the flesh oh we like to just let that
[1:33:15] outlet go up yep flesh is Miami you
[1:33:17] should see how my wife talked to me the
[1:33:18] other day now I ain't talking about your
[1:33:20] wife or your husband or your kids
[1:33:23] they're not your enemy
[1:33:26] little soul-searching a little bit of
[1:33:28] honesty so others become the problem
[1:33:32] but you got to apply Total War to you
[1:33:35] Brett Brown said God said utterly
[1:33:37] destroy the thing amen hallelujah what
[1:33:39] we need today he stops and says you're a
[1:33:42] baby and you around with a whole
[1:33:45] lot of things you ought to be destroying
[1:33:49] there's a lot of people would not have
[1:33:51] liked him for a pastor you're a baby
[1:33:55] and you're sissying around with a lot of
[1:33:57] things you ought to be destroying
[1:34:00] there's a reason that God demands that
[1:34:02] they all be killed because anything you
[1:34:04] don't deal with tonight will face you in
[1:34:06] the morning
[1:34:07] anything you don't deal with now is
[1:34:09] gonna come back around and try to
[1:34:11] destroy you at a later time you're gonna
[1:34:13] have to face it sooner or later so it's
[1:34:15] bad and as morbid as it may sound I'd
[1:34:17] rather deal with it when it's little I'd
[1:34:19] rather deal with it when it's a baby I'd
[1:34:21] rather deal with that bitterness now
[1:34:23] than let it get all wrapped up in my
[1:34:24] heart to where I can't hardly get it out
[1:34:26] of there because it stayed there for
[1:34:27] years kill it tonight kill it tonight
[1:34:30] let it go tonight surrender it tonight
[1:34:33] walk away from it tonight declare war on
[1:34:36] it tonight
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:41] we're going to look at this for a little
[1:34:43] bit in Samuel as we begin to pull this
[1:34:45] down first Samuel 15. and we're going to
[1:34:49] go through this chapter
[1:34:50] Samuel also said unto Saul the Lord sent
[1:34:54] me to anoint thee to be king over his
[1:34:55] people over Israel now therefore hearken
[1:34:58] now unto the voice of the words of the
[1:35:00] Lord thus saith the Lord of hosts I
[1:35:02] remember that which amalek did to Israel
[1:35:05] how he laid weight for him in the way
[1:35:07] when he came up from Egypt now go and
[1:35:10] smite amalek and utterly destroy all
[1:35:12] that they have and spare them not but
[1:35:14] slay both man and women infant and
[1:35:18] suckling ox and sheep camel and ass
[1:35:23] this is Total War
[1:35:26] General Sherman had nothing
[1:35:29] on this
[1:35:32] but this is what it takes to bring about
[1:35:35] total victory
[1:35:37] without Total War there is not total
[1:35:40] Victory going into verse 4 and Saul
[1:35:42] gathered the people together and
[1:35:43] numbered them and tell them two hundred
[1:35:45] thousand footmen and ten thousand men of
[1:35:47] Judah and Saul came to the city of
[1:35:49] amalek and laid weight in the in the
[1:35:51] valley I'ma skip down to verse seven and
[1:35:54] Saul smote the amalekites from havilah
[1:35:57] until thou comest Ash to sure that is
[1:35:58] over against Egypt and he took agag the
[1:36:01] king of the amalekites alive uh oh
[1:36:05] everything was going so good
[1:36:08] everything was lining up so perfect
[1:36:10] but we have an uh oh
[1:36:13] and utterly destroyed all the people
[1:36:16] with the edge of the sword how is it
[1:36:18] that in the middle of Deliverance
[1:36:20] in the middle of victory in the middle
[1:36:22] of a mighty move of God we stop and let
[1:36:24] the enemy Escape
[1:36:27] why is it that we let the enemy live
[1:36:31] it's because we don't think it matters
[1:36:35] it's because we think there's value in
[1:36:38] it
[1:36:40] you think there's value in your opinion
[1:36:46] you think there's value in your ideas
[1:36:50] and so you put it there up against the
[1:36:53] word even though the word says get rid
[1:36:55] of it
[1:36:56] even though the word says destroyed
[1:36:58] because you value it you won't kill it
[1:37:03] verse 9.
[1:37:04] but Saul and the people spared a gag and
[1:37:07] the best of the sheep and of The Oxen
[1:37:09] and of the fatlings and the Lambs and
[1:37:11] all that was good and would not utterly
[1:37:13] destroy them but everything that was
[1:37:15] vile and refused that they destroyed
[1:37:18] utterly well yeah it's vile and refuse
[1:37:21] we can see where that needs to die of
[1:37:23] course we don't need to do those things
[1:37:25] of course not
[1:37:27] absolutely destroy that I see where
[1:37:30] that's wrong but listen all of it was a
[1:37:34] link back
[1:37:36] every last one of it was a link back to
[1:37:39] the enemy's claim on the land if one was
[1:37:43] still alive they could say we had it
[1:37:45] first this was ours first it may have
[1:37:47] been years ago but I have a claim here I
[1:37:50] lived here before you did
[1:37:53] that's why you got to destroy your ideas
[1:37:55] that's why you got to destroy your
[1:37:57] thoughts because all of it is a link
[1:37:59] back to the curse all of it is a link
[1:38:01] back to this flesh right here that tries
[1:38:04] to lay a claim on your soul and so if
[1:38:07] you don't lay it down when you lose that
[1:38:09] ugly temper or you say things you
[1:38:11] shouldn't there's a link back and he
[1:38:12] says see I was here first I had you
[1:38:15] first I say the night wipe out every
[1:38:17] claim deal with every claim on the land
[1:38:19] this body has a claim on it it was not
[1:38:22] his first it was God's first it was laid
[1:38:25] out here before the world was ever in
[1:38:28] existence all the elements were here and
[1:38:30] one day it will resurrect it will not be
[1:38:33] a replacement it will be a resurrection
[1:38:35] because God had a claim on it first but
[1:38:39] you've got to wipe out all the other
[1:38:40] things that already linked back to the
[1:38:43] curse
[1:38:44] wipe those things out that attitude that
[1:38:47] rebelliousness that unforgiveness it's
[1:38:49] all a link back
[1:38:52] verse 10.
[1:38:53] then came the word of the Lord unto
[1:38:55] Samuel saying
[1:38:57] it repenteth me that I have set up Saul
[1:38:59] to be king for he is turned back from
[1:39:01] following me and have not performed my
[1:39:04] Commandments and it Grieves Samuel and
[1:39:06] he cried unto the Lord all night
[1:39:08] notice
[1:39:10] Saul did a lot of what God told him to
[1:39:12] do
[1:39:14] oh I feel like there's a lot of us
[1:39:17] we've done a lot of what God has told us
[1:39:19] to do
[1:39:20] but look at how God looks at it failure
[1:39:24] to do any of it
[1:39:26] was a failure in all of it
[1:39:29] we better quit judging ourselves based
[1:39:32] off the public school system grading
[1:39:33] scale 94 that's an a God says f
[1:39:41] you failed
[1:39:42] 98 I'm doing really good now listen all
[1:39:46] of us have fallen short
[1:39:48] we're talking about intentional
[1:39:50] disobedience
[1:39:52] I see it and I go no 98 is good enough
[1:39:57] there better be an effort to be 100 on
[1:40:01] every last bit of it and if you happen
[1:40:03] to fall short then plead the blood with
[1:40:05] all your heart plead the blood Lord
[1:40:07] maybe I stumbled maybe I fell I see it
[1:40:09] there Lord I'm fighting for it and I
[1:40:11] plead the blood for every shortcoming I
[1:40:13] have but an intentional disregard for
[1:40:15] the word in the least is a complete
[1:40:19] failure
[1:40:22] I want you
[1:40:23] go with me to verse 12 and when Saul
[1:40:25] rose up Samuel rose up early to meet
[1:40:27] Saul in the morning it was told Samuel
[1:40:29] saying Saul came to Carmel and behold he
[1:40:32] set up a place and has gone about and
[1:40:34] passed on and gone down to gilgal and
[1:40:37] Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto
[1:40:39] him now notice the self-righteousness of
[1:40:41] Saul
[1:40:43] blessed be thou of the Lord I have
[1:40:46] performed the Commandments of the Lord
[1:40:51] wow that is a total contradiction to
[1:40:54] what the word just said about Saul
[1:40:56] Saul's standing there oh absolutely I'm
[1:40:59] I'm born again
[1:41:01] I've got the new birth I'm I'm doing
[1:41:03] exactly what the word tells me to do
[1:41:05] each I mean yeah okay so Wednesdays
[1:41:08] ain't that big a deal but
[1:41:10] I come by on Sundays every time I can
[1:41:14] oh no no no no we're we're living a good
[1:41:17] life I would hate for you to see my
[1:41:20] movie collection but other than that
[1:41:23] man we are Christians
[1:41:30] Saul says look what I've done
[1:41:32] look at how it prospers listen your
[1:41:35] Prosperity has nothing to do with
[1:41:37] whether or not you're living right
[1:41:39] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[1:41:41] hardships of life don't always mean
[1:41:43] somebody is out of the will of God and
[1:41:45] he said the blessings of life don't mean
[1:41:46] that you're in the will of God and we
[1:41:49] get so proud look what I built look at
[1:41:51] this business look how God prospers me
[1:41:53] and yet you're snared out of the house
[1:41:54] of God and you're going to sit there and
[1:41:56] say God did that God kept you out of the
[1:41:58] house of God
[1:42:02] you are so blessed that he kept you on
[1:42:04] vacation 49 weeks out of the year
[1:42:08] but those three times you were here oh
[1:42:10] it was good
[1:42:14] I'm leaving in the morning
[1:42:18] he says look how it prospers
[1:42:20] I've done what God Said do
[1:42:23] listen do not get to the end of the line
[1:42:25] and point
[1:42:27] to what you've done
[1:42:29] it won't be enough
[1:42:31] I promise you don't get to that place
[1:42:33] and point to well I'm a Believer I
[1:42:36] accepted the message I'm a Believer
[1:42:39] I've said this before and I'll
[1:42:40] congratulate you as well if you're a
[1:42:43] Believer congratulations you've reached
[1:42:44] the level of the devil
[1:42:50] y'all are standing on the same level
[1:42:52] he's a believer
[1:42:53] and he trembles he's got some of us at
[1:42:55] least he's got some respect and fear
[1:42:57] understanding the power of it some of us
[1:42:59] have done away with the power we're
[1:43:00] denying the power thereof I say don't
[1:43:02] stay with I'm a Believer say I'm a
[1:43:04] Believer and then go further I'm a
[1:43:06] Believer and I've been born again I'm a
[1:43:08] Believer and I'm fighting I'm a Believer
[1:43:10] and I'm pressing I'm a Believer and I'm
[1:43:12] leaving everything in this world behind
[1:43:13] yes I'm a Believer but that's not where
[1:43:16] I'm stopping I'm going on I'm going
[1:43:18] further I'm fighting for more yes I'm a
[1:43:22] Believer I thank God you're a Believer
[1:43:24] but there's so much more go attain it
[1:43:26] tonight declare war tonight
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:31] we can't get to the place where we're
[1:43:33] like Saul and we'll argue with the word
[1:43:35] and
[1:43:36] we can look into the Bible listen
[1:43:38] there's no debate on whether or not
[1:43:39] there has to be a new birth
[1:43:41] you can look in the Bible the first
[1:43:43] Doctrine Jesus preaches a man must be
[1:43:45] born again or he will no wise enter into
[1:43:47] the kingdom of God look at look at what
[1:43:49] the prophet says in 1964 what's the
[1:43:51] matter today with the people a new birth
[1:43:54] they're all they all Dodge it they don't
[1:43:55] like it oh they have substituted
[1:43:57] something for the New Birth come up and
[1:43:59] believe and that's all you have to do
[1:44:00] the devil believes himself and you know
[1:44:03] he's not born again there's a new birth
[1:44:06] there's something that goes with it and
[1:44:08] it's kind of unfitting and untasting to
[1:44:11] the world
[1:44:13] we can't Dodge the New Birth Church
[1:44:15] we can't Dodge the new birth and we've
[1:44:17] got to start recognizing who the enemy
[1:44:19] is and be willing to die out to self you
[1:44:23] must go to the upper room for your self
[1:44:27] verse 14.
[1:44:29] and Samuel said what meaneth then this
[1:44:32] bleeding of the sheep in mine ears in
[1:44:34] the lowing of The Oxen which I hear and
[1:44:37] Saul said
[1:44:40] they
[1:44:42] they it can't be me
[1:44:45] it can't be me it's they they have
[1:44:48] brought them from the amalekites for the
[1:44:51] people
[1:44:53] spared the best of the sheep and of The
[1:44:55] Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God
[1:44:57] and the rest we have utterly destroyed
[1:45:01] still trying to defend his actions still
[1:45:04] trying to deflect blame listen
[1:45:06] self-righteous folk Ain't Much on
[1:45:07] accepting blame
[1:45:10] they don't too much like like blank
[1:45:12] folks that have a a religious spirit on
[1:45:14] them they don't like to see the error of
[1:45:16] their ways it's always going to be they
[1:45:20] it's always going to be they and when
[1:45:23] you can't admit fault then you can never
[1:45:26] be delivered
[1:45:29] verse 16.
[1:45:31] then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I
[1:45:34] will tell thee what the Lord has said to
[1:45:35] me this night and he said unto him say
[1:45:37] on and Samuel said when thou was little
[1:45:39] and not on site West thou not made the
[1:45:41] head of the tribes of Israel and the
[1:45:43] Lord anointed thee King over Israel and
[1:45:45] the Lord sent thee on a journey and said
[1:45:47] go and utterly destroy the Sinners the
[1:45:50] amalekites and fight against them until
[1:45:52] they be consumed wherefore then does
[1:45:54] thou not obey the voice of the Lord but
[1:45:57] this fly open the spool and it's evil in
[1:46:00] the sight of the Lord notice how God
[1:46:03] interprets his actions so much different
[1:46:05] than the way Saul interprets his actions
[1:46:08] and Saul said unto Samuel listen he's
[1:46:11] standing in the face of the prophet
[1:46:16] now maybe not in person but on tape and
[1:46:18] on books you can look right into the
[1:46:20] face of the prophet
[1:46:21] into into the word of God
[1:46:24] he looks right in the face of the
[1:46:25] prophet and says yay I have obeyed the
[1:46:28] voice of the Lord and have gone the way
[1:46:31] which the Lord sent me and have brought
[1:46:33] a gag the king of the amalek and have
[1:46:36] utterly destroyed
[1:46:38] the amalekites he has gotten so lifted
[1:46:42] up himself
[1:46:43] and is so has such an inability to
[1:46:46] recognize self as the enemy to where he
[1:46:48] values his opinion over what the prophet
[1:46:51] has just said to him lip to ear
[1:46:55] the prophet said this and he says no
[1:46:57] you're wrong
[1:46:59] I did what God told me to do
[1:47:03] I have obeyed the Lord that's just your
[1:47:06] opinion brother Donnie
[1:47:08] that is just your opinion I have done
[1:47:12] all that God has told me and commanded
[1:47:14] me to do
[1:47:15] verse 21 but the people took the spool
[1:47:18] sheep and oxen and chief of the things
[1:47:21] which should have been utterly destroyed
[1:47:22] to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in
[1:47:26] gilgal interesting there
[1:47:29] Suddenly It's thy God
[1:47:32] said the Lord our God
[1:47:39] Saul couldn't line up to the word
[1:47:42] he just kept making excuses kept making
[1:47:44] excuses quit making excuses tonight and
[1:47:46] line up to what the word says to light
[1:47:48] up to declare Total War on anything that
[1:47:51] is standing in your way listen I had to
[1:47:54] declare war on who I was I say none of
[1:47:56] this self-righteously I was a scum of
[1:47:59] the earth not good person oh surely
[1:48:03] surely I was
[1:48:05] and I sat and raised up on the church
[1:48:07] pew raised up in a message Church in a
[1:48:09] mighty good church
[1:48:11] and I was lost and I was filthy and I
[1:48:13] had my own ideas and I had to declare
[1:48:15] war on who I was and recognize what
[1:48:18] you've learned and what you know means
[1:48:20] nothing and only then then and only then
[1:48:23] could I truly be saved and filled with
[1:48:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I
[1:48:27] realized Aaron Oglesby had nothing of
[1:48:29] value to offer the Lord Jesus my
[1:48:32] opinions needed to Die My attitudes
[1:48:33] needed to Die My Rebellion needed to die
[1:48:35] so that he could live in me and until
[1:48:38] you get to that point you won't have
[1:48:40] total Victory I had to recognize it and
[1:48:42] dine out to self isn't easy dying out
[1:48:45] yourself hurts but it's something that
[1:48:47] we all must do I've recognized the enemy
[1:48:50] I see where it's at and now I want to
[1:48:52] lay that life down so that a better life
[1:48:55] a greater life a holy life a righteous
[1:48:58] life an eternal life can come and dwell
[1:49:00] on the inside of me
[1:49:02] I had to declare war on me
[1:49:06] I could have laid back as a crutch and
[1:49:08] say well my daddy said this and my
[1:49:10] parents didn't have a good relationship
[1:49:11] and I was hurt here and I was scarred
[1:49:14] there none of it mattered lay it down
[1:49:16] lay it down tonight say Lord I'm yours
[1:49:19] you take me you mold me you show me the
[1:49:23] truth and then when he shows it to you
[1:49:25] be willing to walk in it well I see that
[1:49:29] that I see it right there but Mom and
[1:49:30] Daddy said
[1:49:32] I see it right there but the church I
[1:49:34] was raised in says
[1:49:37] can you declare war on that tonight
[1:49:38] inside with the word of God
[1:49:41] can you side with what this is
[1:49:45] can you march under these marching
[1:49:47] orders right here
[1:49:48] [Applause]
[1:49:52] verse 22. and Samuel said hath the Lord
[1:49:56] has great delight and burn offerings and
[1:49:58] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:50:01] the Lord behold to obey is better than
[1:50:04] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[1:50:07] rams now I'm gonna stop just a minute
[1:50:09] and deal with this if you know me at all
[1:50:11] you know I love freedom of worship
[1:50:14] you know I love it when the people get
[1:50:16] loose and the spirit gets free and
[1:50:18] people run and they jump and they shout
[1:50:19] and they speak I love all that stuff
[1:50:21] but I'm gonna tell you right now he
[1:50:23] would much rather you live a clean holy
[1:50:25] Sanctified Pure Life and be somebody
[1:50:28] that don't do those things then be a
[1:50:29] runner all over this place with sin in
[1:50:31] your life
[1:50:33] I just thought we'd hit that for just a
[1:50:35] second yes he wants your worship yes he
[1:50:38] desires it yes he wants pure Pentecostal
[1:50:40] worship just like at the beginning but
[1:50:42] he wants pure worship from clean vessels
[1:50:45] he wants the worshiper to come from an
[1:50:47] overcoming Victorious Life
[1:50:50] so I'm all for that I support it I'll
[1:50:53] never take your jump or your shout or
[1:50:55] your dad's from you matter of fact I'll
[1:50:57] throw gas on the fire when you're doing
[1:50:59] it
[1:51:00] I love it
[1:51:03] but let that same drink you give him on
[1:51:05] Sunday be the drink that he gets out of
[1:51:07] your life on Monday and Tuesday and
[1:51:09] Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and
[1:51:12] Saturday
[1:51:13] oh we love to give him worship on Sunday
[1:51:15] then Monday he's at the well waiting
[1:51:17] going
[1:51:19] they were sure fired up yesterday
[1:51:22] where are they at on Monday morning
[1:51:28] to obey is better than sacrifice and to
[1:51:31] hearken in the fat of rams verse 23 for
[1:51:33] Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft
[1:51:34] and stubbornness is as iniquity and
[1:51:36] idolatry because thou has rejected the
[1:51:39] word of the Lord he hath also rejected
[1:51:41] thee from being King and we're going to
[1:51:44] skip down to verse 32 as we wrap this up
[1:51:48] then said Samuel bring ye hither to me
[1:51:51] agag the king of the amalekites and they
[1:51:53] get came unto him delicately and agag
[1:51:57] said surely the bitterness of death is
[1:52:00] passed this word delicately here says he
[1:52:03] came in a stately manner treading
[1:52:05] lightly but in a stately manner to let
[1:52:07] him know I am a king
[1:52:10] I I'm the king that has ruled over your
[1:52:12] life
[1:52:13] but surely
[1:52:15] surely you can forget about all that
[1:52:17] depression that I put on you surely you
[1:52:19] can forget about the hardship that I
[1:52:21] brought into your home and the anxiety
[1:52:23] and the trouble you've had sleeping and
[1:52:24] and surely you can forget about all that
[1:52:27] stuff and and we can let bygones be
[1:52:29] bygones
[1:52:30] and he says tonight don't declare war on
[1:52:32] me tonight it's okay I'll back off for a
[1:52:35] little bit surely all that stuff is is
[1:52:38] behind us I know I've hurt you I know
[1:52:41] but all that's in the past now just let
[1:52:44] me live one more day
[1:52:46] let me live
[1:52:48] one more day
[1:52:50] and Samuel said as thy swore sword hath
[1:52:54] made women childless so shall thy mother
[1:52:56] be childless among women and Samuel hude
[1:53:00] a gag in pieces before the Lord in
[1:53:04] gilgal I'm telling you tonight the Lord
[1:53:06] will give you total Victory when you're
[1:53:08] willing to declare Total War if you're

[1:54:04] it tonight declare war on it tonight
[1:54:08] Hallelujah
[1:54:13] will you stand with me
[1:54:15] musicians could come
[1:54:17] we're going to look at Esther 3 as we
[1:54:19] close this
[1:54:24] whatever and wherever you've stopped
[1:54:26] short
[1:54:27] deal with it tonight
[1:54:28] don't let it linger another day because
[1:54:31] it will return to fight you
[1:54:33] it will come to fight you don't
[1:54:35] procrastinate don't hesitate to do all
[1:54:39] that the word tells you to do don't have
[1:54:41] mercy on the devil even for a moment
[1:54:43] bitterness has ate you up deal with it
[1:54:45] tonight
[1:54:47] unforgiveness is in your heart let it go
[1:54:49] tonight
[1:54:51] if you have a critical spirit
[1:54:54] deal with it tonight
[1:54:56] lay it down tonight
[1:54:59] we find Haman over in Esther is a this
[1:55:02] is incredible to me and I know we don't
[1:55:04] always put
[1:55:06] thus saith the Lord or stock into Jewish
[1:55:08] histories and Jewish writings but I
[1:55:09] found this incredible
[1:55:11] you know we find Haman over in Esther as
[1:55:13] a direct descendant of the amalekites
[1:55:15] that Saul was supposed to destroy
[1:55:18] and he even carries the name of their
[1:55:21] King agang
[1:55:24] verse 1 of chapter 3 and Esther says and
[1:55:27] after these things did King of hazarus
[1:55:29] promote Haman the son of hamaditha the
[1:55:32] agagite
[1:55:35] Jewish writings say that the leniency
[1:55:38] shown by Saul to King agag actually made
[1:55:41] it possible for Haman to appear because
[1:55:45] he had been had he been killed one day
[1:55:47] sooner
[1:55:48] one day sooner or the day he was
[1:55:51] supposed to be killed the great Peril
[1:55:53] which the Jews had to undergo at the
[1:55:55] hands of Haman would have been averted
[1:55:57] because it was in that time frame of one
[1:56:00] day that agag's lineage lineage was able
[1:56:03] to continue
[1:56:05] and led directly
[1:56:07] to Haman
[1:56:08] that one day
[1:56:10] let me live one day
[1:56:12] let me live
[1:56:14] one more day
[1:56:16] but you don't have to be a Saul today
[1:56:19] you don't have to be a saw
[1:56:21] regardless of where you find yourself
[1:56:23] you can be a Mordecai
[1:56:25] you can be a mordecai today because the
[1:56:27] Bible would tell us in Esther 2 and 5
[1:56:30] that Mordecai was a descendant
[1:56:33] of Kish
[1:56:35] so not only do we have a descendant of a
[1:56:38] guy but once again we have one of Saul's
[1:56:41] or kesh's Descendants on the scene and
[1:56:44] God gives Mordecai
[1:56:46] the opportunity to be a cycle breaker
[1:56:49] he says listen tonight your Daddy might
[1:56:52] have failed your mama might have failed
[1:56:54] Daddy might not have took his head off
[1:56:56] mama night night her declared war what
[1:56:58] she is supposed to but tonight I'm
[1:57:00] giving you the opportunity you can deal
[1:57:02] with it you can fight it you can say It
[1:57:04] Ends Tonight my children won't deal with
[1:57:06] this the psycho won't continue but
[1:57:09] tonight we're gonna hang him from the
[1:57:10] hollows tonight we're gonna pour our
[1:57:13] sword and chop him to pieces because the
[1:57:15] cycle ends here it will not carry on
[1:57:18] tonight we deal with it tonight we
[1:57:21] declare war tonight there's freedom in
[1:57:23] the house of God you do not have to walk
[1:57:25] out of here with the same Spirit hanging
[1:57:28] on you that you walked in here with
[1:57:29] tonight leave it here declare war and
[1:57:32] Total War will bring you Absolute Total
[1:57:36] Victory God bless you tonight Saints
[1:58:02] I'm sure that God spoke to
[1:58:05] every one of us tonight one way or
[1:58:07] another
[1:58:10] no matter where you find yourself
[1:58:15] as our brothers so
[1:58:19] brought it to us in such an open
[1:58:20] wonderful way
[1:58:22] and we can see
[1:58:23] as the prophet told us our greatest
[1:58:25] enemy
[1:58:26] is ourself
[1:58:30] but no one looking around now just you
[1:58:32] and the Lord
[1:58:34] may the Lord be able to deal with each
[1:58:36] of us begin with me Lord
[1:58:39] all the way back to the nurseries
[1:58:40] upstairs to the sound booth
[1:58:44] to those that are in their living room
[1:58:45] maybe in their bedroom they're sick they
[1:58:47] can even get up
[1:58:49] but may the spirit of God
[1:58:51] deal with each of us under the sound of
[1:58:53] his word tonight
[1:58:56] that we will not only be
[1:58:59] just people who believe and people who
[1:59:01] worship and people who love God but
[1:59:04] people
[1:59:05] of War
[1:59:06] apparently the Lord's wanting to get
[1:59:08] this over to us brother Daryl just a
[1:59:10] couple of Wednesday nights ago spoke
[1:59:12] about war
[1:59:14] so the Lord wants us to hear it and to
[1:59:16] be ready
[1:59:18] we don't want our enemy to destroy us
[1:59:21] remember those quotes that he quoted
[1:59:23] there tonight was taken from where
[1:59:25] brother Brandon was preaching about
[1:59:26] Samson
[1:59:29] destroy your enemy before your enemy
[1:59:31] destroys you both of those were from the
[1:59:33] sermons about Samson
[1:59:35] Samson did not destroy his enemy
[1:59:38] but his enemy almost annihilated him
[1:59:41] had not had been for the grace of God it
[1:59:43] would destroyed him
[1:59:45] so may the Lord help us that we can be
[1:59:48] able to look at ourselves now don't
[1:59:49] think about your wife don't think about
[1:59:50] your brother don't think about the
[1:59:52] pastor or someone else who you think has
[1:59:54] hindered you
[1:59:55] but think about you
[1:59:59] Heavenly Father
[2:00:02] we are grateful tonight for your word
[2:00:05] Lord we don't want to be the type of
[2:00:08] people that will bring a pitchfork to
[2:00:11] church
[2:00:13] and we will throw this and that the
[2:00:16] other well I wish so-and-so was there
[2:00:18] tonight and so and so sure needed that
[2:00:20] and more he sure preached on this person
[2:00:22] and that person
[2:00:24] Lord God
[2:00:25] we want to apply the word
[2:00:28] to our hearts Our lives our souls our
[2:00:32] minds and especially our flesh
[2:00:36] for we know Lord that it is a battle and
[2:00:39] it will be as you so vividly described
[2:00:42] it to us tonight
[2:00:44] until this body is changed
[2:00:46] but we believe that we can live a life
[2:00:49] that will bring this flesh subject to
[2:00:52] the word of God
[2:00:54] and it truly will be a battle because
[2:00:56] the soul being converted Wars every day
[2:00:58] against the flesh which is not
[2:01:01] but it can be dominant
[2:01:04] he didn't know neither do these people
[2:01:06] know
[2:01:07] but just sit and study him last night
[2:01:10] and one of our rights and I'll deal with
[2:01:12] Lord willing on Sunday will be the right
[2:01:14] to reign
[2:01:16] and before Lord I was going to deal with
[2:01:18] us reigning with you
[2:01:19] I was going to deal with basilio
[2:01:22] which is Satan wanting to reign in our
[2:01:24] flesh let not sin therefore reign in
[2:01:28] your mortal body
[2:01:29] basilio which means to be king
[2:01:34] so the Bible was speaking to people that
[2:01:36] were saved Christians
[2:01:38] but Satan still want to be king of our
[2:01:42] flesh
[2:01:43] oh Jesus
[2:01:45] we bring ourselves to you tonight Lord
[2:01:49] our ideas our opinions
[2:01:52] our scars our shortcomings our hurt
[2:01:55] feelings all those things Lord many of
[2:01:59] these folks laid down cigarettes years
[2:02:00] ago and it ain't bothered them since
[2:02:03] but there'll be many people that will be
[2:02:04] took to Hell by bitterness that had
[2:02:07] smoked never smoked a cigarette
[2:02:09] and we know that bitterness and
[2:02:11] resentment and sarcastic we know the
[2:02:14] prophet himself told his church he said
[2:02:17] pray for me because I have developed
[2:02:20] such a critical spirit
[2:02:23] I criticize this I criticize that it was
[2:02:28] not something he was proud of
[2:02:30] he wanted deliverance from it
[2:02:33] oh Jesus may we be able to look at
[2:02:36] ourselves tonight father
[2:02:38] not the way Saul did how blind he was
[2:02:44] to think that he was following your will
[2:02:47] so perfectly
[2:02:49] and yet he would not take what the
[2:02:51] prophet said
[2:02:52] he felt led or he was convinced or he
[2:02:56] had a some type of feeling or something
[2:03:00] and he took it directly over what the
[2:03:03] prophet's message was
[2:03:05] dear God help us tonight father
[2:03:08] I don't believe you've sent this word
[2:03:10] Lord for the church at sinking Creek I
[2:03:14] don't believe you sent this word tonight
[2:03:15] for brother Ron Spencer's Church you
[2:03:18] sent it for our church
[2:03:21] I wish this person and that person
[2:03:23] another person would have been here but
[2:03:25] I was here and I heard you speak to me
[2:03:29] and Lord I pray each one here tonight
[2:03:32] would say father help me Lord
[2:03:35] we raise our hands in your presence Lord
[2:03:38] oh Jesus it's not my brother it's not my
[2:03:42] sister but it's me O Lord
[2:03:45] help us I pray tonight Heavenly Father
[2:03:48] oh lord it's not that many of these
[2:03:51] people are living loose sinful lives but
[2:03:54] you're calling us to a higher place and
[2:03:57] remember every time you've done
[2:03:58] something when the prophet's wall you
[2:04:01] would say I tell him to consecrate
[2:04:03] himself a little more before the Angels
[2:04:05] come down he said consecrate yourself
[2:04:07] separate yourself from these men
[2:04:10] so you we hear not a call that we've got
[2:04:13] to get saved not a call that we've got
[2:04:15] to all be re-baptized we hear a call for
[2:04:18] a deeper walk we believe there's greater
[2:04:21] things that lay before us father and we
[2:04:23] don't think we can go into those greater
[2:04:25] things walking on this plane Where We
[2:04:28] Are Tonight We must come closer
[2:04:32] oh Jesus don't pass Us by tonight father
[2:04:37] we've heard your word now we need your
[2:04:40] spirit to Quicken it to us we need your
[2:04:43] spirit to touch us Lord
[2:04:46] so as Fanny Crosby said it so many many
[2:04:49] years ago while on others Thou Art
[2:04:53] calling do not pass me by
[2:04:56] so Jesus I make it personal to you
[2:04:59] tonight
[2:05:00] Don't Pass Me By our Lord
[2:05:02] oh savior savior here are my humble cry
[2:05:08] help me that I can recognize my enemy
[2:05:12] father
[2:05:13] oh dear God that we will declare Total
[2:05:18] War
[2:05:19] the majority of the people in the South
[2:05:21] that mention the name Sherman they still
[2:05:24] don't like him to this day he's not very
[2:05:27] well thought of by Renity many of the
[2:05:29] authors in the South do destroyed much
[2:05:32] of their buildings much of their
[2:05:34] architecture and this and that but these
[2:05:37] very mention of his name brought a
[2:05:40] paralyzing fear among the people may it
[2:05:43] be said about us whenever the Devils
[2:05:46] mention our names may it be a paralyzing
[2:05:50] fear that shakes through hell Hallelujah
[2:05:54] not only because we are out to get them
[2:05:57] but we know who our greatest enemy is
[2:06:00] our self
[2:06:02] I wonder how brother Brandon would feel
[2:06:04] whenever we idolize his greatest enemy
[2:06:08] many of the message people idolize the
[2:06:11] Flesh of brother Branham and he declared
[2:06:14] that flesh to be his greatest enemy
[2:06:17] greater than epilepsy greater than
[2:06:20] denominationalism
[2:06:22] himself and yet many of us idolize that
[2:06:26] enemy it's no wonder then we idolize
[2:06:29] ourself
[2:06:31] help us I pray father to declare Total
[2:06:34] War
[2:06:36] it would be hard to kill the little
[2:06:38] malachite baby it would be hard to kill
[2:06:41] in those days a little jebusite we'd
[2:06:44] found it on the side of the road and it
[2:06:46] was crying its mother was dead its
[2:06:48] father was dead our human compassion
[2:06:51] which we find out is against the will of
[2:06:53] God many times would have picked it up
[2:06:56] we would have snuck it home against the
[2:06:59] message of the hour and we would have
[2:07:01] babied it and pampered it and raised it
[2:07:03] as our own
[2:07:05] and every day would have been against
[2:07:06] the will of God
[2:07:09] help us father maybe we've took a little
[2:07:11] jebusite here and a little ammo right
[2:07:14] there and a little hittite here and a
[2:07:16] little high bite there Lord God In The
[2:07:19] Name of Jesus May the spirit of God
[2:07:22] help each of us father to drag out our
[2:07:25] swords and start killing our enemies
[2:07:29] granted Lord God
[2:07:32] how many wants to be remembered tonight
[2:07:34] before the Lord that's your desire God
[2:07:37] help me to kill my enemy before my enemy
[2:07:41] kills me
[2:07:43] oh Hallelujah remember reading in the
[2:07:45] Book of Joshua
[2:07:47] when Joshua was getting ready to depart
[2:07:49] now
[2:07:51] and they still had not taken their land
[2:07:53] they still had not moved in and there
[2:07:57] was a move it's been several years since
[2:07:59] I read it and I don't remember if it was
[2:08:01] the tribe but Benjamin or if it was the
[2:08:03] tribe of Joseph when the Manasseh tribe
[2:08:06] but the Bible says that they let this
[2:08:08] certain group of people live and they
[2:08:11] didn't kill them and then it was like a
[2:08:14] plague that started among every other
[2:08:17] tribe and they did not kill them and
[2:08:19] they did not kill them and they did not
[2:08:21] kill them so it was a move among the
[2:08:25] whole entire message that they begin to
[2:08:28] let these enemies live and before long
[2:08:31] they begin to worship their gods their
[2:08:34] children began to worship their gods and
[2:08:37] then you find in the days of Nehemiah
[2:08:39] that the people spake in the language
[2:08:42] half of ashdod and half of Hebrews so
[2:08:47] they made their own language and it was
[2:08:49] a language of the hybrid to words that
[2:08:52] they merged it together oh God help us
[2:08:56] help us Lord
[2:08:58] how many thanks God tonight for the
[2:09:00] sermon
