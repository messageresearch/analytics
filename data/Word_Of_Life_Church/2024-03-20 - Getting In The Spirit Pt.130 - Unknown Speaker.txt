Father Amen Let bow our heads together if you would tonight thank you Lord truly Lord if your prophet in 1964 would tell us that the hope of the church in this hour is the coming of the Lord Jesus here we are all these years later if that was the hope then how much more is it our hope now Lord God we're so grateful that our hope is not in politics our hope is not in the economy we know it's an election year for our nation and people get all cranked up and think boy this man will do this and this man will do that but we're taught in the scripture and the message of the hour that our nation is beyond non Redemption it's too far gone Lord we're so grateful that we're not looking for a political hero we're not looking for Satan's Superman but we're waiting on the coming of the Lord Jesus would you take your word tonight father would you speak to our hearts you see what we have need of we thank you for a Wednesday night service when we can be gathered together help us tonight Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Jesus and the Saints said amen praise the Lord is it an awesome privilege to be able to be gathered together here in the house of God tonight are you happy happy to be serving the lord happy to be a son or daughter of god let's turn to Revelation 10 tonight if you would verse 7 Lord willing I guess we're still scheduled um for questions and answers tomorrow night at 7:00 for the Youth so y'all come remembering that it'll also be strange for those of you that are over the hill you can stream it and stay home uh we look forward to it got some really good questions again and we're thankful for the opportunity to be able to to answer them Revelation chapter 10 um verse 7 down through verses 11 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now remember this is God's way of declaring Revelations and Mysteries to make them known not by a pastor not by an tele evangelist not by a teacher but by a prophet and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book I remember moving from chapter 5 when the book was closed to uh chapter 10 a great thing has transpired to make this even possible that it would be able to happen go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it so John says give it to me and he said no you take it you take it that's typical for us human beings ain't it give me give me give me give me and sometimes you know what God's telling us take it take your ground take your land amen take your inherit itance take your healing from the devil take your Victory from the devil and what do we tend to say give me give me give me I went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it not only take it but take it and eat it eat it how eat it up eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings may the Lord bless his word you may be seated let's turn to the Book of Ruth chapter 4 verse three we know that there's couple of different books that are the types of redemption in the Old Testament Joshua is one of them Book of Esther and also the Book of Ruth in there is written part of the the great plan of God naturally looking back in retrospect makes more sense to us than it would have if we would have lived in the days whenever it was written even in the New Testament when they would have read the book of Ruth uh the book of eser even the Book of Joshua probably many of them did not see how it linked with God's mystery of what he was going to do down through the church ages but God has a way about him and if we can ever find that way then it's unchangeable and we can see it repeat over and over and over again and we can base whatever we believe on this principle that I am God and I change not so if God ever required Holiness out of people God always will if God demanded a sacrifice that would speak for us then God always will so if we can find that God deals with man in a certain way of redemption then we can see with its Old Testament dispensation between the old and the new or the new or even conclusively ending it up in the Millennium with the earth going into the eighth day then all of that will come through a very similar pattern now watch this in the book of ruths we're very familiar with the story and it is focusing now upon this stage to where Ruth has been obedient in her part to what her mother-in-law taught her to do and we of course must do exactly what God wants us to do in the Plan of Redemption and then he will do what he knows that we cannot we are told to take the book and to eat it but God is the only one that could open the book and make it edible so you see God does his part than we do our part we work together and it produces the finished product of what he wants now here we have this stage of the kinsman redeemer now remember Revelation chapter 5 it was exploiting the evil of Satan as it comes over the opening of the seals in chapter 6 it goes into chapter 7 of course chapter 8 the opening of The Seven seal and then chapter n chapter 10 chapter 11 will be the Revelation the two witnesses chapter 12 over into the tribulation period and it's it's typed in the Old Testament and now Boaz is going to call for the next of kin to step forward and so you can understand it take the book If there is one there that can take the book now there was one that was a closer kin to Rose and we know that he actually had the first claim on The Inheritance now watch and he said unto the Kinsman Naomi that is come again out of the country of Moab sell us a parcel of land which was our brother elik and I thought to advertise thee saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the Elders of my people if thou wil redeem it redeem it but if thou will not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and I am after thee now notice I am after thee and he said I will redeem it now remember this is the Old Testament type of the book of redemption in the New Testament and of course we know that Ruth was a gentile now Maan her husband had passed away but he was a direct heir to the land which they had left remember that God divided the land it was God that gave them the inheritance zebulin napali naftal rather Joseph Benjamin Levi on and on and on and God said the land could never be sold among them so a person from the tribe of Judah could not buy some of the land from Ephraim and say I'll trade out with you god designated where they were to live and they were to be there so even though they had long since been gone that land could not be sold to another tribe a rich man come in and said now I I like that land I want it well what tribe you belong to well I I belong to Nephi I belong to Joseph I belong to Benjamin oh no no no that that's not possible you can't do that that it has to be one that belongs to this tribe so then the property was left to Malo but maon also died so then that meant that Naomi and Ruth were the current owners so it come down to them now in order to be able to buy this land and we know to history tells us this was his name and to was a very a very selfish individual he was an individual that wanted to buy land he was not interested in the lever law but he was interested in possess s and he was interested in all that he could get out of life there's many toes that are living in this day are they not so Boaz must go by the law and the law itself said that the next of Ken was the one that had the right to buy the property so here the house had run down the barn no doubt had fell and the land was in terrible shape so Naomi said you know what I don't have a husband I'm too old to get a husband my daughter-in-law she's not married so I think I'd probably be better off just to sell this property I'd be better off to sell it but it's got to come through the direct law of God so somebody a merchant passed through from Macedonia another Merchant pass through from Syria another pass through from thessalonica hey I want to buy this no it could not be sold to them it had to be sold to someone who was of the right tribe had to be sold to someone that was even of the right family that was a Kinsman so by right then this Kinsman the next of kin was told then after him of course was Boaz so Boaz wants it he wants this land but Boaz is not this selfish type the way to is Boaz wants it because he wants her he's going to get the land and he's going to get Naomi's rights when he buys it but he's buying it mainly because he wants Ruth now notice he says in verse 5 then said Boaz what day now to spoke up and said okay yeah I want this land I want it now remember the one that had the first claim on you and I was actually not Jesus that's right it was the devil devil somebody said it was the devil he had the first claim on every one of us and Satan said absolutely I want them I'll take it on but you know really what he wants he wants this earth when it was in its primeval State the volcano volcanoes were belching out and the fire was spewing upon the breast of the earth and the Rocks were belching out of its very Soul if I can say it that way and the lava was still smoldering thousands of degrees on the face of the Earth and Satan walked upon this Earth in its primeval State staking his claim I want this Earth now remember the Angels actually fell before the world the Earth was ever laid in its foundation form and they saw God they saw him as he spread the universe trillions and trillions of stars that we're still finding out all the universe and all the things that are there but God showed favor to one one little tiny Speck of dust in this little corner of this subdivision of the universe and when God shows special favor to anything though it may be small and minute and so insignificant Satan wants it you think he wants you CUA you're a yce you think he wants you because you're a Johnson or or a Phillips or a Robins or your name is Reagan or or or or Frederick or you think he wants you because you're Donnie or Betty or or whoever you are he don't want you because of that he wants you because God has shown a special favor towards you anything that God loves it presents an automatic hatred from Satan when God said his love upon you that marked you with this gigantic X on your back when God showed you the first Speck of his Mercy it might have been when you was three years old and you swallowed a marble and they thought you was going to die or something happened to you and you're 5 years old and and and whatever it was and God in his Mercy divinely intervene for your life that sent a message down to Hell we better watch this one from this time on because something happened to them they should have died something supernaturally intervened in their life I hope you understand what I'm saying and many of you can remember back God in his Mercy spared you when you were very young you didn't realize it then but once the spirit of God quickens your life there was something about you that was noted in heaven which also made a note down in hell and that's why when you were a little child it seemed like the guns of hell were aimed after you like there were nobody else in your family or nobody else you went to school with don't you understand why you wouldn't even serving God didn't even have maybe a knowledge of God but God showed you special favor and that marked you well I don't know how you feel about that tonight I consider that a great honor I consider that a great honor that Satan's got a big old EX on my back cuz that means Jesus has got a big check mark on my heart because I'm one of his I belong to him I don't know how you feel about it it is worse being loved in a special way I don't know how you look at your trials and how you face them but I look at mine oh my I look at them and I know I am hated by the devil I know he despises me if he can't get me one way he'll try another and another and another and another I mean knows what I'm talking about I consider that a sign of my heavenly father's appr approval it means that the devil don't like me and I want him to know tonight the feelings are definitely mutual I don't only don't like him I hate him I hate his kingdom I hate what he stands for oh hallelujah oh and I count it a privilege and an honor to be hated by the devil come on let's have church tonight what do you say I consider it one of the greatest honors of my life to be loved by all men Mighty God hallelujah apparently you are worth fighting for you are worse dying for you are worse him coming to this Earth for which puts a mark on your back we it proudly but don't never forget the check on the front of your heart now watch this what day that thou buest the field of the hand of Naomi thou must abide also of Ruth the more AB this now he definitely wanted to mention this name don't forget to say who she is be sure and tell old brother toad be sure and that old brother to no she's not a Jew but she's a gentile that was an self would have been bad enough to be of Moab which was born of incest come on now there ain't no way in the world that to hearing about her would ever want to Mar his inheritance so Boaz wants to be sure and let toad know where she come from but th must also abide also of Ruth the moabites the wife of the Dead to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance now what Boaz is doing is reminding to of the leverate law anybody know what that means the leverate law the leverate law it was that if a man had a wife and the man died and did not have a son then when someone else took that woman and married her it was his obligation that the firstborn son would bear the name of that dead husband and also get his inheritance now keep in mind now whenever you're going to take this woman to your firstborn son out of this Union will get this inheritance she will be recognized among the tribes she will be accepted because you married her but are you willing to Bear her reproach H so he must raise up the name of the Dead why was this done so no tribes in the children of Israel or no families would be forgotten they would have a living Mentor one that would be remembered their generation on down on down on down and their patronage might be dead for hundreds of years but they would still have descendants now what how the prophet takes this and he said now in this Sevenfold book of seals of redemption that the lamb took the book within himself the lamb took the book within himself the only one who could do it and he took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now to claim his Redemptive to claim his rights to claim for me and you what he redeemed us from to see back to everything that Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden he has redeemed us back to that praise God now notice what Boaz is standing there in the breach but there's one standing there in the breach with him which has a claim on her naturally humanly he has a stricter more legal claim and a hold than Boaz heart did to's claim was by the law I can make you marry me I can make you do this Boaz did not want to make her do that Boaz fell in love with her praise the Lord I hope you understand Jesus actually fell in love with you before the foundation of the world now notice what he says and I thought to advertise the saying by it before the inhabitants and before the Elders of my people if thou Wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou will not redeem it then tell me I want to hear you say it devil I want to hear you say it Satan that you don't want her I want to hear you say it you cannot afford to buy her Hallelujah well after all he's a poor devil anyway I'm going to give y'all my thunder right now but notice he says then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and I am after thee and he said I will redeem it notice again the prophet in conference he said now no other man no Bishop no post Pope no Cardinal no nothing can help you you're the only one that can do it he's the one then the conference was Satan was standing there ready to claim the human race and he said he had rights because they sinned yeah so when you were born and you were attached by your neor to your mother he said it's another Renegade another Renegade another Renegade the prophet said when you see that naal it's a sign of a renegade so when we were all born amen we were Renegades lost seemingly without hope and I did say seemingly Hallelujah notice he goes on to say and you people that Che has had the tapes on the Seven Seals when the lamb come forth to claim his Redemption what he had redeemed time was finished then he's in the work now doing the work of redemption but someday never remember this is three months after the seals were broke open I know there's some in our ranks that want to say 1963 ended it all March of 63 ended it and when the Seven Seals is open there's no more Mercy but here's the same prophet of God saying three months after he preached the Seven Seals that someday he walks from the sanctuary to take up the book of redemption now notice things can happen in a symbol and then they must needs also happen in reality form and whenever we go in the Rapture is the reality form of the book of redemption made flesh being gathered into the hands of the Lamb of God now notice he says to take up the book of redemption that he's purchased with his own blood then the hour is over he comes forth then to claim what he has redeemed then said Boaz verse 5 what day thou buest the field of the hand of Naomi thou must also buy a Roose of Mo about it's the wife of the dead now he explains to toe this right of kinsmanship so you've got to acquire Ruth the property will go to her son and you must bear the reproach of her being a moabitas Hallelujah so you ain't just getting the Earth devil this Earth belongs to [Applause] [Music] us so if you get the Earth you got to get Donnie come on you imagine him down in hell right now when I said that said I don't want Don I don't want you I don't want you aren't you glad you've got that kind of a name down in hell that Satan says oh no I I I'd like to have Tennessee but I don't want some of them tennesseans I'd like to have Indiana but I don't want some of them Holy Ghost filled Holy Rollers that them saints of God I don't want nothing like that why if if I let them on the earth they'd turn the world upside down in six months time they'd turn my kingdom upside down he don't want you he hates you he despises you oh I'm so glad he does but does he want this Earth yeah but he can't get it without getting me so it puts him in a straight [Music] so you want Johnson City do you guess what you got to have us and I'll tell you what I'll do in your kingdom I'll cast you out Lucifer I'll lay hands on those that you make sick and by the power of God live in me I'll cast you out of them you can see why don't Ain want [Applause] us notice this in the future home now remember this this here tonight is is our future home I know it Bears its resemblance still yet of being marked by sin but watch what will happen to it now how striking now he says he takes the place where we're to dwell in through the same process what process process he's talking about the process of redemption now he called The Church through justification called it through sanctification filled it with the Holy Ghost and Fire he took it through a process that he himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God could dwell in the human heart could dwell in the human heart now it has to go through the that before he can come into it oh brother Donnie I want to I give my heart to the Lord thank God you did I laid aside my smoking I laid it aside my drink and I I quit that thank God I I've got Sanctified good wonderful but he still ain't in you yet you're on your way but he wants to come into your soul and seal your soul to the day of your Redemption now watch he parallels the earth going to the exact same thing notice he done the world where the bride is going to live in the same way his same Plan of Salvation now the world to be redeemed for this redeemed person he uses his same method he baptized it in water after the uian destruction shed his blood upon it to sanctify it and claim it it's his Satan tried to say I'll give it to you he said no sir I'll buy it now watch s said I'll give it to you he said Ain't No Way ain't no way you giving me this if you give it to me you'll have a claim against it you have a claim and you'll be able to come back I want it abstract or nothing I don't want no deal with the devil I will not take no gift from you come on somebody I will buy it I will pay the price and I will do what you can't I want that Holy rer wife I want them Holy Ghost fill Sons and Daughters of God that's the kind of people I want that's the kind of people I feel welcome being around he said [Applause] but now it has to go through a baptism of fire remember there will be a nuclear war World War I will be a nuclear war and it will bring such destruction and Devastation on this Earth it will s as if though it is not redeemable the nuclear fallout will be so horrendous Blackness Darkness but as he did you he will take this chaotic mess at the end of the tribulation period when the nuclear war will seem as if though Satan saying well if I can't have it then I'll destroy it I'll annihilate the whole if I can't have it I'll put it in man's head I broke into your laboratory enough to understand the atoms and I'll make man so smart I'll make the Russians and the Iranians and the Americans I'll make them so smart I I'll have the whole world annihilated if I can have it you ain't getting it God come on devil I'm God you're just a devil he could just tell him I want this Earth this Earth is mine it's my attribute and you will not destroy it amen but I want you to think of what a chaos it will be by the time the tribulation period rolls around it will be such a terrible Place ashes of human bodies will be all over the Earth and we will walk out on them that have rejected God's word and in a moment and a twinkling of an eye as he changed our ashes our mortality into an immortal body the spirit of God will come on the earth in the form of the Millennium experience and the Holy Spirit of God will straighten her back up off of her 23 degrees axis that she's tilted on the spirit of God will straighten she's wobbling now out in space wobbling wobbling wobbling like that that's why I put the moon out there but the gravitational Pole to help keep it from Just spinning out in the universe and the spirit of God will move upon the Earth and he will bring her back up and stand her upright and she will have the proper the proper angle the proper temperature she'll come right back like it was in the garden of of Eden why because Adam's sin called God out of his Millennium and God stopped his Millennium but he will live it out again in the form of Jesus Christ the son of David on the throne on the earth and we will walk out on the ashes of the wicked there will be Atomic fod everywhere there will be Atomic Fallout and then a moment of time he will change am and the Earth will be beautiful and green and the birds will be seen and the animals will transformed and the big gigantic African lions and the Asian Lions and the Tigers they look over at the sheep look over at the cattle and they'll just say how you doing today how you doing come on let's let's hang out together what do you say don't you see what he's going to do he's bringing this earth into this stage of redemption she's following in your footsteps amen you get the Holy Ghost before she does but you getting it is proof she will then before we go into the E day it will not be another nuclear explosion but it will be holy fire from God out of Heaven he will lift the bride at the end of the Millennium off the face of the earth and the fire of God will come down and he will begin to burn the surface in the prop said maybe thousands of rounds remember beneath her crust beneath her crust still lays all the bones and all the echos skeletons and all the things of the past ages in there lays the geological record of her past of her earthquakes of the of the different things that's there at L thousands of miles maybe beneath her crust and he will go all the way down to erase all of her past Hallelujah in the Millennium it's not the Eighth Day so we will live on the top of those things that are buried there and all those fossils and the dinosaurs and all of that but in the end of the Millennium that saw a new heavens and a new Earth Hallelujah and I John saw the holy city from God descending down from God out of Heaven as a bride adorned for her husband and the Eighth Day the Earth will receive the Holy Ghost in tight and God will annihilate every dinosaur skeleton everything that lays in her geological record of her past just like he does a son and daughter of God you may have the memory of being lost you may have the memory of being a sinner and being a drunk but brother sister once you get your new body your geological record is gone to Hallelujah not only gone from your soul but gone from your mind gone from your memory whenever we move into that body the whole record is [Applause] annihilated notice it has to go through a baptism of fire Holy Fire from God which cleanses the earth and the heavens around it the heavens are contaminated with these demons yeah they they move back and forth they they communicate they talk that's what the prophet saw on the fourth dimension was these demons so God will Purge remember not one devil has ever set a foot inside your new city the devil has been Before the Throne of God right he went right there and accused job and and he still accuses us to this day but there ain't never been a devil footprint inside the bride's new home God's got a sign up there as it were no trespassing to Devils no Devils allowed there won't be one devil that'll never set a tow print inside that new city Jesus is gone to prepare it for you there won't be one imp there will not be one sickness there will not be one trouble not one devil has ever set a foot inside of that precious City what it's got your name roll all over it amen and he's got to make this Earth to be a suited place for him to come down and live on it notice the baptism of fires to cleanse it from sin from sickness from disease germs from sinners from the devil and all this group he's cast out of the Lake of Fire Holy Fire from God comes down from God out of heaven and burns it up notice to make it ready for God to dwell in for God in the new world is to come and dwell in the earth cuz you say God he dwells in the human heart but he and the bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world and the same Plan of Redemption is used to redeem both world and the persons that live in it praise be to God now watch ruths 4: 6 and the Kinsman said I cannot say it again I cannot redeem it wanton you to notice he don't even call Ruth by name he don't even acknowledge her as if she even exists but he says it he didn't want her he wanted the Earth he wanted the property but God called you by name Hallelujah aren't you glad you're not a number was God you've got a name oh my and the Kinsman said I cannot redeem it for myself lest I Mar my own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for I cannot say it again devil just say it one more time I cannot redeem it can you imagine imagine how Ruth and Naomi felt they might have said hold my mu oh my you I feel a spell coming on cuz just a few minutes prior to this he said I want it a few minutes prior to this he said I will redeem it oh you imagine her heart must have sunk and then only must have said no no no no this is not the way it's supposed to go this is not the way it's supposed to be look friend when God has a plan there ain't enough devils in hell to stop it and if God has a plan even the prayers of the children of God won't stop it either because there's times we pray contrary to the will of God but I'm so glad his sovereignty overrides even sometimes our sincerest wrong [Applause] prayers oh it seemed like everything was lost the whole plan is going to be messed up and then he said I cannot redeem it now the word redeem means to set free by paying a price I find this amazing on this little chapter it's not that big at all but the key theme of this chapter whenever you get time to read it is redemption the words redeem buy Redemption purchase is used 15 times in this one so a person cannot be redeemed without someone paying the price and to says he did not want it he he he couldn't do it now you know to us salvation is free but don't ever get in your mind the Salvation is free on God's part it cost God oh my such a price it's free to us but it's not free to him and the kinman said I cannot redeem it for myself lest I Mar talk to me now devil talk to me the word Mar to destroy corrupt go to ruin Decay that's exactly the way he feels about you Holy Ghost feel acts 238 young ones you would certainly be a reproach in one of his modern prostitut systems for you to get in there and go to telling them that you got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that God had sent a prophet in the last days with a message why you certainly would mire the good thing they've got going he said I don't want them bunch of holy rollers around here but the prophet tells us in the invisible Union that's the only kind that the word can bring forth because they've got the second Adam's way of acting how was that not like a bunch of theologians but acting like they did on the day of Pentecost amen come on somebody and what did they say about them second Adam's children they said why these men are drunk Peter said up and say glory to God we're not denying that we're not drunk we're just don't using the brand you all think were using this is that that was spoken by the prophet Jo it shall come to pass in the last day sath God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh your Sons and Daughters shall prophesy come on somebody that promise is still going on tonight that promise is right here in this building tonight if there's somebody that ain't got the Holy Ghost you can leave out of this place tonight with the Holy Ghost because that same God is still baptizing people with the Holy Ghost and still Healing The Sick and still casting out Devils cuz he's the same yesterday today and forever so he renounced the r of Redemption on the account of one condition or maybe I should say it like this one person Hallelujah Oh Glory to God so he says no no no no no I I I would I would Mar my inheritance now it said that to was already married to the World Council of churches I I mean he had he was already married and had children of course [Laughter] so you imagine bringing this Holy Roller Roose into the World Council I I mean in in into your home and and Ruth you know I mean his other wife maybe you know she had double closets in her room because her dresses were so short she could double stack you know I mean or or or slight drawer and and and things like that but Roose Roose would require this great big old space you know cuz she was a dress wearing woman and and of course you know she appeared on the outside like a Godly woman and a holy woman and all the people there that she had this report among them that she was a righteous godly woman why cuz God had called her name called her out of Moab and worshiping Kosh to worshiping the Living God and he said oh Lord have mercy if I brought her in like that now if I could get her to cut her hair off and if I could do her to get her to do this Ru said there ain't no way you getting me to do that way ain't no way at all I've done seen m name written in the book I heard from oopy I recognized the word of God was Eagle food I left the other thing so to if you plan on marrying me let me tell you what I do I pray when I'm up I pray when I'm down I sing when I'm up I sing when I'm down I jump when I'm up I jump when I'm down I've got Victory when I'm up I've got Victory when I'm down you might hear me get alone by myself and I can't speak Hebrew no more you might hear me get alone and you see me down on my knees oh yeah you see me down on my knees and you hear you see my lips moving and you think that I'm defeated you think that I'm say y that's the end of him until you heard me say amen and you realize I was not saying it's over you realize I was not saying I quit come on children you realize I was not giving up but I was giving my burden to the Lord I was giving my trouble to the Lord and amen mean so be it and you realize oh Lord how can I bring a woman like that into my denomination how can I bring a woman like that into my system she'd tie up the whole [Applause] thing and also to had a little bit of a crisis a little financial crisis he was going to have to come up with the money to buy this property the Bible does not tell us about the Kinsman that he was wealthy but it tells us that Boaz was so this Kinsman did not have the wealth right y'all ready good so the Bible says that Boaz was a mighty man of wealth and he could afford to buy the Earth as a matter of fact he could afford to buy the whole universe he could afford to buy whatever he wanted because he was a mighty man of wealth and after all the Devil he's a poor devil let me just read you some things that I put down here today he has no love no power no mercy no inheritance no forgiveness no Deliverance no eternal life no golden streets no Gates of peril oh come on now come on now he has no peace to give you oh he will not roll your burden away he is a very poor well while I've got him down let me stomp him let me kick him let me humble him right down there where the Lord wants you to see him he is not your Lord and Master he has got nothing to offer you compared to what our lord Jesus can give you he has no eternal life he has no Eternal peace he has no Eternal Kingdom he has no Eternal City well glory to God he only has a lake of fire to take you to and you will be annihilated and destroyed but our Boaz has love and he has mercy and he has healing and he has deliverance and he has Miracles and he has signs and he has oh Hallelujah he has joy and speakable and full of Glory so which one do you want to marry a rich man or a begging devil Hallelujah so to says I love the way this is written redeem thou my right and literally in the Hebrew he's saying at this this way redeem my Redemption I can't do it I can talk them into sinning but I can never get them out don't you understand he can get you in and he'll get you in over your head Sam will always lead you farther than you ever intended to go and Satan will lead you in there but he can't get you out he can't deliver you amen well glory to God redeem my Redemption perform that act of redemption which I cannot perform it's absolutely amazing when you look at this the Kinsman wanted to protect his name and his inheritance the scripture doesn't even mention his name so what he wanted so hard to protect he wound up losing anyway Boaz was willing glory to God Boaz was willing to Mar his name what he owned to get her and because of that love and commitment his scriptures his name is found written in God's Eternal Word hallelujah oh let the world laugh at us let them make fun of us let them do whatever they want to do but let us realize friends we have the greatest honor the human beings could ever have and that is give our All to Jesus Christ oh the world and the devil will tell you oh you're you're losing so much you're being robbed of so much and tell me what am I being robbed of tell me what have I being robbed of my goodness if I live a couple more months I'll be 68 years old which means I've been preaching 50 years of my life been Pion for 40 and and been a Christian you know all these years y Brother Don do you regret it are you kidding me you kidding me I've never smoked I've never drunk I've never been high well I shouldn't really say that I have been high in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but I ain't never done none of that would I want to go back and relive it are you kidding me the way I look at it I'm married to the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and that Low Down Rotten devil he ain't got no Heaven he ain't got no righteousness he ain't got no Purity why would I leave my Lord Jesus and follow a like that why would I leave the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and go following the devil and him Lead Me to Hell No thank you so notice what Boaz did he took the risk of love and obedience and his name is found written in the scripture and held and high honor praise God Ruth 4:7 now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe now that's weird to us right we said you imagine you're going into a courthouse and the next closing you got brother Paul you go in and you tell the buyer and the seller now y'all trade shoes they're going to say oh dear God and this guy processed our loan but now remember it was perfectly fitting for the time so you mean changing of the shoe was a sign of changing of property and deeds and confirming it also so then you would take your shoe off and give it to his neighbor and this was a testimony in Israel we said why in the world would they do that brother Donnie because they didn't have Tennessee walking horses to walk around their property or golf carts or 44s or four-wheelers but they walked over their property in their shoes so everywhere their foot touched was a sign of their inheritance so to give your shoe to someone else seal the deal because them shoes had walked on these 593 Acres trees ponds Creeks you know whatever's there these shoes have walked on them so if I could get you to give me your shoe that meant you were forfeiting your right Hallelujah don't you understand why our lord Jesus had to come down to the Earth and kick off his shoe as it was take on mortality and humble himself and remove his shoes would you Marvel then that at the Last Supper he would get a basin of water and sit down and remove the shoes of his disciples and wash their feet why they're fixing to walk new ground Holy Ghost ground Peter sandals won't be able to take him there he'll need some shoes of Jesus Oh Glory to God so by removing the sandal notice now since they walked off the land this is the way they did it so this was the sign of their inheritance all right now to I want you to forfeit your rights take off your shoe now would y'all want to walk like there for the rest of your life I would to God we could see it tonight in the eyes of God if we could look at it right we would realize the devil is as barefooted as he can be and every promise you get a hold of that you find your name written on and you have a need for it Prince means possession to reach over and take the devil's shoe off give me my healing back now you see since they walked on the land then by removing the sandals of the Guardian a widow removed his authorization to administer the land of her household don't you understand where that shoe who it was took off in front of it was took off and the front of us give it up devil let me have it do glory to God I wish I was out in the woods by myself I feel another language coming on Oh Glory take your shoe off give it to me I'm sick of you robbing me of my joy I'm sick of you robbing me of my health I'm sick of you robbing me of me and my children going to church and sitting there I'm sick of you stealing my wife away from me my husband away from me I'm sick of you stealing my rock for me to have the Holy Ghost give me your shoe now listen I know this seems strange to you but in the hurian and the newsi texts which was found to be written in a uniform style in other words on a cylinder of clay and they didn't have a book The Way We Do today but they would take and write them on wet moist clay and they actually have written found transactions that were buried in the sand and beneath rocks and all that the hurian text is one of them and the newsy text are others and they actually have it written there about this that land transfers in the newsy text involved replacing the old owner's foot on the land with that of the new owner so when they would go out and close the deal instead of sitting in the lawyer's office and signing 57 pages of stuff you don't even know what you've signed away and you're just sitting there hoping that that's the last face because of your hands about to fall off you say so what would they do then brother Paul had a piece of property he wanted to sell me we go out to that property and brother Paul stands on that property and then whenever the deal is made he removes his feet off of that property and I step mine back on it he has forfeited his rights to claim ownership to that property it is no longer his well glory to God can I have a few more minutes thank you I'm going to take them anyway whether you want me to have or not notice the prophet said Jesus was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed it's yours but you'll have to fight for every anch that you possess everywhere The Souls of your feet travel God told Joshua I have given you Footprints means possession let's move in tonight amen let's go in Footprints is possession let's take every inch of ground that God has given us all children why are we going to sit here and wait I'm waiting for the Millennium you won't need it in the Millennium you don't need healing then you need it now you don't need joy in the Millennium now is when you need it if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter said the promis is unto you and to your children them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Footprints is his possession let's go get it it's ours Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever let's possess it The Works said I do so you do also let's possess it it's God's promise don't look at the the circumstances don't look at how hard it is let's possess the [Applause] land well I have a meeting like this morning and we're having a meeting there and the Holy Ghost falling in the place and people screaming and shouting oh dear Lord you mean people acted like that in brother bram's meetings people screaming and shouting praising the Lord and then someone come up and said pray for me brother renom I said lay hands on them I prayed for them I said now go and believe now here's what it is it's easy to feel the power of God and to see it when you believe but then when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have that's the thing brother we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours and you'll fight for every inch of it am Footprints means possession remember that sister in the wheelchair you mean he would have the osity to tell a woman sitting in a wheelchair wasn't osity it was Faith Footprints mean possession remember that sister in the wheelchair Footprints means possession every time the SES of your feet touch that's it take that much ground say I couldn't wiggle my finger yesterday but I can wiggle L today you got that much possession just keep moving on just keep going on tomorrow you can wiggle your hand then the next day your arm and the next thing you know here you go just keep going Footprints is possession but we go to get our land and there stands that lying Dev I'll tell you one thing I'll huff and puff and blow your house down I'm not Little Red Riding Hood devil I'm not a Little Red Riding Hood I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I was called before the foundation of the world and you ain't nothing but a bag a wind get out of my way but every devil in hell will stand on the borders of your property and say you can't have it you can't have it you can't take it and they'll scare the liver out of you if you'll let them or you can stand right up to them and Buzz up in their face and say you are a liar my symptoms you're a liar you're lying vanity my blood pressure it's a lie my heart rate it's a lie my my pain it's a lie the bondage of sin on my family it's a lie turn them loose devil turn them loose devil so Footprints means possession some people can just barely get to the edge of the land that ain't me if you want that that's up to you if he purchased 640 acres for me I want all 640 just barely get to the edge of the Lamb some can take a two-handed sword and cut their way through the Philistines and amorites till they can take Oh Glory the whole thing that's what we should do every promise to us we got Footprints his possession walk right up and take it God gave it to us it's a promise and it's truth and it's for us now in these Creeds they come around against I make them with their tradition the Commandments of God of none effect but what's it do it takes it away explains it all away is there anybody here tonight that would like to take every square foot of your spiritual inheritance in God anybody why wouldn't we look at the price that our boy paid and he's done drove the devil off but the devil wants to convince you that he's still there and we let him scare us to death and he ain't got enough power he couldn't make a flea I'll pause my sermon okay you're so powerful you're so great you're so tremendous you're so wonderful you think you know so much you think you've been around so much you think you know how to be God you think you want to be God you think you can be God I'm going to give you 10 minutes to come and make a flea for us now I'll go ahead and talk while you're performing okay if he can't make a flea or a fly or one Speck of dust why would you believe one word he has to say call him what he is a liar a liar a cheat a deceiver let's stand up and we'll Worship the Lord while he's trying to make a little d let me read this and we'll close it's I need to include this if you don't mind now Satan knows this same principle Footprints means possession for Satan had the Earth the very rocks that he once walked up and down on the earth burning brimstonegunsmithing earth when it was a burning volcanic so when God is causing the Earth in its primeval stage Satan's walking up and down on it this is mine this is mine I claim it I want it Footprints means possession I want you to notice something then the prophet said God put back into the hands of a man a way back to what he was looking for he had to weep no more yet when he broke the backbone of Satan there Cal the backbone of sin I want you to notice in that paragraph above let me tie these two together now them same rocks that had cooled off when Jesus died at Calvary beled o the Earth got sick and started vomiting [Applause] and when the earth started vomiting it vomited up some of the footprints that were made thousands of years before in lava uhhuh when Jesus died at Calvary it belts Force out of the earth them same rocks that had cooled off I remember he walked on it when it was fire and left his Footprints then it cooled off and he said I got it there's evidence before there was ever a man here I was here before there every woman I was here there's my footprints and cooled off Stone Hallelujah so when Jesus died at Calvary the earth started shaking Shak what was he doing belching up the ownership busting up them Footprints I mean busting them all to pieces you know what's amazing is the prophet said I read read the other day he said I read a book the other day and he said it just so thrilled me and he said that they said they said that Adam died and was buried on the very same place where Jesus died and he said I thought oh Lord could that be was that the way it was that Adam died and was buried and here come the second man Adam and died and rose again but he didn't just rise from the grave but them footprints that Insignia that sign of ownership he said come on Earth help me out a little bit go to shaken and the Earth began to respond to the voice of God and the earth started shouting woo glory to God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus went to kicking out Footprints out there and God just busted them all up he said hey devil hey devil I want to know where your Deeds at I want to know where your Deeds at well I I know I walk right down by Calvary there I want you to show me where your ownership is that's the way it does a real son or daughter of God when the devil says he's mine She's Mine He's Mine and Jesus said I want you to know they ain't yours no more I done shook hell out of their life I shook drinking out of their life I shook lying out of their life your Footprints are destroyed and he broke the backbone of Satan di at Calvary the backbone of sin and of sickness our sins are forgiven no more can Satan black us from God there's a highway made a telephone sitting up there and there's a line to Glory it brings every person in reach of that line Ruth 48 therefore the Kinsman said unto Boaz buy it for thee and he drew off his shoe I forfeit my rights to your bride she's way too noisy for me I read the other day friends and one of the playoffs football y'all know of course I'm a big sports fan right but I read for some of the people had went to one I forget what it was who was playing who but it was so cold you probably remember about it and I read just this week where they said some of the people that was there at that football game are going to have to have fingers removed going to have to have different parts of their bodies amputated because they got frostbit sitting out there watching their favorite team play and I thought if people that go to church had half of that desire can you imagine if we had Church in it N9 below zero I'm going to have of us would be there besides me and Harry you would be too okay good at least we have organ and piano can you imagine people doing that in church oh it's too cold it's too hot oh Lord I like to burn up tonight I I I I I had actually had one drop of sweat on my face how in the world can they expect us to go to the house of God and worship and then bunch of idiots will sit out there in that football and wind up losing a finger losing a joint losing a hand or whatever more for what a pig skin kicked down through there by a bunch of men that has been paid way more money than what they're worse well come on somebody and worshiped by a bunch of people and made Idols out of and here we are tonight sitting in the presence of almighty God and he says come and die and children come and die and I'll heal you if you're sick I'll deliver you if you're lost I'll save you if you're going to hell oh my we should worship him with everything that's in us and take our land some of you need to get your praise back you need to take your praise back from the Devil he sto your [Applause] praise I know I know some of y'all just thought I was crazy not tonight I've convinced you I am brother Donnie I don't understand that makes two of us I don't understand me either about the time I think I can't take no more about the time you think you can't take no more and you just think Lord I just don't know how I'm going to be able to do it pillar fire comes down just set your soul on fire amen and the devil says what in the world happened to that I mean all all this big deal I made out of this what in the world is going on I don't understand them people that's right cuz we're deity it's deity down inside of us It Ain't Us It Ain't Us mother Harvey it's not us mother lar it's not us mother Jackie there something down inside of us that's moving us that motivates us let's pray together oh Lord Jesus how great you are oh father I pray May each of us take these things to Heart that we've heard tonight oh Lord I'm so sorry I'm so sorry that I've let the devil kick me off of one inch of my ground show me tonight Lord show me more of what's mine I want every everything that has my name on it I don't want to get over on my neighbor's property I realize there's boundary lines I ain't no Prophet so I can't I can't do like a prophet did I'm I'm not other ministers but I want what's mine Lord I don't think that's asking too much that's only asking what's got my name on it I pray you'd help my brothers and sisters here tonight Lord that each of them can walk out here with a greater determination than they've ever had in their life if they're sick healing has their name on it the deliverence and it ain't nothing but a ly devil a scarecrow they standing right there to try to keep them off that land lord we want to get to a place like Moses and the children of Israel did in the land of Egypt you brought so much trouble on them Egyptians because of your children they finally said get out get out of here and leave us alone we want to make hell so bent out of shape we want to stress hell so bad that hell can't wait till the morning of the Rapture and they'll say I am so glad that bunch of Holy Rollers has got out of here and left us alone but they won't be near as glad as we'll be Hallelujah because the resurrection will have set in and we will have seen our loved ones and we will be sitting at the table of the marriage supper of the Lamb oh Jesus that's what we long for help us father I pray I want you to do me a favor I want you to take your hand and lay over on the person standing by you you're not praying for yourself now but you're praying for them you're at home you're streaming tonight your husbands to your wives or maybe to your children as well believer to believer Eagle to Eagle Jesus didn't say these signs will just follow preachers but these signs shall follow them that believe that means you and Carol coming from Louisiana the other day and the prophet said what about your hands talking about the Dynamics and the mechanics he said what about your hands then you can take your hands and also lay on the sick father we have our hands laid one upon another tonight you alone know the burden that everyone brought to this service Lord some of them may be sickness some of them worried about a family member maybe worried about a test result that they got back that doesn't sound very good Lord we pray you'd be mindful of every one of them and as Believers we have our hands one upon the other father in the name of Jesus May the sickness leave them right now in Jesus name dear God you have called us as your servants the prophet said the army of God puts sickness on your people uh the army of the devil rather puts a sickness on the people and the army of God takes it off as one of your servants tonight in the name of Jesus I command the devil to leave the children of God May these Demons of doubt and worry and fear may it leave them may sickness sadness oppression whatever more may it go away from the people maybe it's a besetting sin in their life Satan you are defeated kick off your you go ahead and admit it tonight devil you can't redeem us you don't want us you don't want nothing to do with us that's why you hate us but we want you to know we hate you we hate your kingdom we hate your lies you had us bound but you ain't got us bound no more we are free we are children of the most high God we're going to worship him we're going to love him we're going to praise him and there ain't nothing you can do that'll ever stop us you've made plans to try to waylay every one of us and they've everyone failed through and they'll continue to do so because God's Prophet said we are indestructible we are also Unstoppable we are also unblamable we will stand before him without a reproach all your lies will be proven to be exactly that they are nothing but lies we are part of the resurrected Lord Jesus and we say to you tonight you are defeated leave this people tonight Satan in the name of Jesus May every trace of sickness go from their bodies father we claim your promise tonight maybe we can't even wiggle a finger tonight but we believe by tomorrow we'll be able to wiggle it and then by tomorrow night we might wiggle another and then a hand and then an arm and then a leg then the next thing we know by Sunday morning we may be dancing around this place in the spirit of God we want our land lord we want our land we want that devil walking barefoot off of our property and we hope he gets a thorn in every toe he's got a thorn in every inch of his
