[0:14] the sparrows. [music]
[0:16] They don't

[0:27] who watches
[0:30] them [singing] grow. [music]
[0:34] Sing it to me.

[1:51] with do. I like this. But he's not
[1:55] [singing]
[1:56] too [music]
[1:57] busy. He really cares
[2:01] about you. [music]
[2:06] Oh, we [singing]
[2:09] [music] have a heavenly
[2:13] father
[2:15] alone [music]
[2:18] with us
[2:20] full of mercy [music and singing]
[2:23] and a heart full of love. [music]
[2:29] He
[2:31] really cares when [music]
[2:34] your head [singing] is bound.

[2:42] the knees
[2:45] and then [music]
[2:46] you will know. Sing that chorus once
[2:51] again. Oh, we
[2:55] [music] have a heavenly [singing]

[20:50] Sister Bren, if you'll come, be getting
[20:51] ready to sing. [music] Let's sing
[20:53] through it all.
[20:55] I ain't got a clue on a key.
[20:59] Let's just worship him a little bit
[21:00] more. I'm sorry I get a little carried
[21:02] away. Actually, I'm not really all that
[21:05] sorry, but it's okay. We'll sing through
[21:07] it all.
[21:09] I've had many tears and [singing]
[21:12] sorrows.
[21:14] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[21:18] There have been times I didn't [singing]
[21:20] know right
[21:22] from wrong. [music]
[21:28] But in every situation, [music]
[21:32] God gave me blessed consolation
[21:34] [music and singing]
[21:36] that my trials come to only [music]
[21:40] make [singing] me strong. Let's sing a
[21:43] chorus. Oh, [music] through it all.
[21:50] Through it all, [singing and music]
[21:53] I've learned to trust in [music] Jesus.
[21:57] And I've [singing] learned to trust in
[22:00] [music] God. Oh, through it all.
[22:07] through [music] it all. [singing]
[22:11] I learned to depend upon his word.
[22:18] [music]
[22:19] Well, I've [singing] been a lot of
[22:22] places
[22:23] and I've seen a lot [singing]
[22:26] of faces, [music]
[22:28] but there have been times I felt
[22:31] [singing and music] so all alone.
[22:36] Hold in my lonely [singing] hours. Oh,
[22:41] those precious [music]
[22:42] lonely hours.
[22:46] Jesus [music]
[22:46] let me know that I [singing] was his
[22:50] own.
[22:52] Oh, [music]
[22:53] see through it all.
[22:58] through [music] it all.
[23:02] I learned to trust in Jesus and
[23:05] [music and singing]
[23:06] I learn to trust in God. Oh,
[23:11] through all
[23:15] through it all, [singing]
[23:19] [music] I've learned to depend upon his
[23:24] word. Let's sing this [music] last
[23:26] verse. Sing it with all your heart.
[23:27] [singing] Well, I thank God for my
[23:30] [music] mountains.
[23:32] I thank him for my [singing] valleyies.
[23:37] I thank him for the storms he's brought
[23:40] me through.
[23:43] [music]
[23:44] Oh, for if [singing] I never had a
[23:48] problem,
[23:49] how would I know that [singing] God
[23:51] [music] could solve it? How I know what
[23:55] faith his work [singing]
[23:58] can do. Oh,
[24:01] through it all. [music]
[24:06] Through it all,
[24:10] I've [music] learned to trust in Jesus.
[24:12] [singing]
[24:13] And I've learned to trust in [music]

[24:34] [music]
[24:35] Amen. Y'all are singing so good this
[24:37] morning, but you can be seated. Since
[24:39] Brianna, come and sing for us.

[25:24] Jesus. [music]
[25:25] [singing] I can hardly
[25:29] count [singing]
[25:30] the [music] times your grace
[25:34] has pulled me [singing] out.
[25:38] S and shame [singing]
[25:41] had left me bound. I once [singing] was
[25:46] lost,
[25:48] but [music] now I'm found.
[25:51] I once was lost, [music and singing] but

[26:19] Thank you for the ways that you've come
[26:22] through. Jesus, thank you.
[26:27] Looking back, [singing]
[26:30] all I can see is a history [singing]
[26:37] of [music] miracles.
[26:41] And I [singing] know if you're here
[26:44] [music]
[26:45] with me, then nothing [singing] is
[26:51] impossible.

[27:13] things. Thank you for the ways [singing]
[27:16] that you've come through. [music] Jesus,
[27:19] thank you.
[27:21] Jesus, thank you.
[27:26] I can't [music and singing]
[27:27] say it enough. I can't say it [music]
[27:32] enough. I can't say it [singing] enough.
[27:40] I can't [singing] thank you [music]
[27:42] enough. I can't thank you enough.
[27:46] [singing]
[27:47] I can't [music] thank you enough.
[27:54] I can't thank you enough. [singing]
[27:57] I can't thank you enough. I can't thank

[28:24] Thank you for a [music and singing]
[28:25] million little things. Thank you for the
[28:28] ways that you've come through. Jesus,

[28:34] Thank you for your blessings.
[28:37] Thank you for a [singing] million little
[28:40] things. Thank you for the ways that
[28:42] [music] you've come through. Jesus,

[28:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus, thank you.
[28:51] Jesus, [singing] thank
[28:55] you.
[29:04] Amen. Let's all stand.
[29:07] Ask Ask Dad to sing probably one of his
[29:10] most well-known songs. And I'm just
[29:12] going to put the mic down and not sing a
[29:14] lick.
[29:16] Just get out the way. Amen. We'll ask
[29:19] him to sing Dove Lays the lamb before we
[29:20] have brother Donnie come
[29:25] brothers put the words up on the screen.
[29:27] [clears throat] You all probably know
[29:28] this as good as I do. But aren't you
[29:31] glad for the evening light?
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Like brother Donnie said here a while
[29:36] back. All these people that are trying
[29:38] to get us to turn away from following
[29:41] the prophet and the message.
[29:44] What have you got that you think's
[29:46] better?
[29:48] Where would we go?
[29:50] I mean, don't you feel that way? Where
[29:52] would Lord, where would I go to if I if
[29:54] I couldn't if I didn't have the message?
[29:58] Just take me out of this world.
[30:02] I thank God for the evening light.
[30:05] The spirit and the bride are saying
[30:09] [singing] come.
[30:13] [music] The elect [singing]
[30:14] are feeling the stir inside their heart.
[30:20] [music]
[30:21] Cuz our uniting [singing]
[30:23] time has come. We and the father [music]
[30:28] are one. [singing]
[30:31] [music] who will be with our Lord
[30:35] forever [music and singing] more.
[30:39] Oh, the evening light [music] has come.
[30:43] The bride is making [singing]
[30:45] preparation.
[30:48] We're [music] hearing
[30:50] the shout of our king. [music]
[30:56] The token man. [music]
[31:00] He's cleaning from inside [singing]
[31:04] and the dove leaves [music] a lamb once
[31:08] again.
[31:12] Fine linen clean [music and singing] and
[31:14] white was granted to her.
[31:20] She's [music] been washed in the blood
[31:22] [singing]
[31:23] of God's own son
[31:27] with [music] righteousness.
[31:29] It's not our [singing] own. We stand
[31:32] just before his [music] throne
[31:38] where [singing] we reign with our Lord
[31:41] forever [music] more.
[31:45] Oh, evening [music]
[31:47] light has come. The bride is making
[31:52] preparations.

[32:02] The token man.
[32:06] He's cleaning from [music] inside.
[32:10] And the dumb made a lamb once again.
[32:17] [music]

[32:21] bride is making [music and singing]
[32:24] preparation.
[32:26] We're still hearing the shout [music]

[33:26] once again.
[33:33] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[33:40] Amen. That's wonderful. God bless you.
[33:42] You can be seated for just a couple of
[33:44] moments. I've got a baby to dedicate
[33:47] today. Brother Tyler and Sister Caitlyn,
[33:49] if I bring a little son, we'll dedicate
[33:52] him to the Lord today. And it a
[33:54] privilege for us to be together in the
[33:57] house of God.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing it.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Bring [music]
[34:04] them in.
[34:08] Bring them [singing]
[34:10] in from the [music] fields of sin.
[34:17] Bring them in.
[34:22] Bring [singing] them in.
[34:28] Bring the little ones to [music] Jesus.
[34:33] [singing]
[34:38] Let's bow our heads together.
[34:42] Heavenly Father, what a great honor and
[34:44] a privilege it is
[34:46] another little child that we can bring
[34:49] into your presence.
[34:52] Lord, we can see the darkness and the
[34:54] chaos that's around us every day in the
[34:56] world that we live.
[34:58] If we didn't have you, it would be
[35:00] frightening to think that we would want
[35:03] to bring children into this world in its
[35:06] present state.
[35:08] But Lord, we're grateful that we're not
[35:10] just bringing them into this life, but
[35:12] we're believing that they will be with
[35:15] us in that life that is to come. For
[35:18] Isaiah said it would be them and their
[35:21] offspring with them.
[35:24] My brother and sister want to bring
[35:26] their little son to you today. father.
[35:29] Whenever they brought him home from the
[35:31] hospital, no doubt they told him to do
[35:34] this and that and the other. But no
[35:36] matter how hard they would have
[35:38] searched, there would have been no
[35:40] manual to come home with him, how to
[35:43] raise him, how to influence him, how to
[35:46] affect him in life. But you've already
[35:49] given that to us, Lord. It's your word.
[35:53] So I pray that you'd help my brother.
[35:55] Pray that you'd help my sister. She's
[35:57] been given the great title of the fifth
[36:00] gospel, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and
[36:04] Mother. I pray you'd help both of them,
[36:07] Father, to be able to influence his
[36:09] little life in a way that will be
[36:11] pleasing to you. Keep him from the evils
[36:14] of the day, Father. We dedicate his
[36:16] little life to you, Father, in the name
[36:19] of Jesus. Amen.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he wanted to look around a little
[36:25] bit and see you all.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together if you would. We'll
[36:39] turn to second Peter chapter 1 verse 2.
[36:45] Certainly welcome each of you here today
[36:48] in the house of the Lord.
[36:50] um
[36:52] brothers and sisters here from Ukraine,
[36:54] Brother Alex, mom and dad, and those
[36:56] that are with them,
[36:58] any visitors, other visitors that we
[37:00] have.
[37:02] We've been looking at the um the divine
[37:05] nature of God and being partakers of it
[37:07] and God building a body, a mystical body
[37:14] for his presence to dwell in. and those
[37:18] virtues which God
[37:21] by his very own nature wants to put in
[37:24] us. So let's read together. Second Peter
[37:28] 1 verse 2.
[37:31] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[37:33] through the knowledge of God and of
[37:35] Jesus
[37:36] our Lord. According as his divine power
[37:41] hath given unto us all things. Wow.
[37:46] Isn't that wonderful? all things that
[37:48] pertain unto life and godliness
[37:52] through the knowledge of him that hath
[37:54] called us to glory and virtue. Whereby
[37:57] given unto us exceeding great and
[37:59] precious promises, that by these you
[38:01] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[38:06] having escaped the corruption that is in
[38:08] the world through lust. And beside this,
[38:11] giving all diligence and to your faith
[38:14] virtue to virtue, knowledge to
[38:18] knowledge, temperance to temperance,
[38:21] patience, and to patience, godliness,
[38:25] and to godliness,
[38:27] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[38:30] kindness,
[38:31] charity. How many like to be remembered
[38:34] today as we pray? Amen. God bless each
[38:36] of you. Heavenly Father, we count it
[38:40] such a great honor once again that we
[38:44] could
[38:46] be able to come together, not only just
[38:49] physically that we would have strength
[38:51] and be well enough to do it, but still
[38:54] so far living in a nation that we can
[38:58] have this right. We're grateful, Lord
[39:02] God. We realize our nation is
[39:04] represented in the book of Revelation
[39:06] with those two horns.
[39:09] And we know, Father, one day she will
[39:12] raise up and it will try to take that
[39:16] from us. To me, prophecy is unclear as
[39:19] far as how how far along it will move
[39:22] when the bride is still here. But we
[39:25] know one thing. You will have us
[39:27] prepared for whatever will come. And we
[39:30] believe your word now will help us to be
[39:34] ready for what the future holds. So you
[39:37] saw the hundreds of hands that were
[39:38] uplifted today. Maybe sickness,
[39:40] financial needs, troubles in their
[39:42] homes, whatever they are. Lord Jesus,
[39:45] would you meet each one of us in our
[39:48] need? Help me, Lord, that I can speak
[39:51] that which is only beneficial and
[39:53] helpful. Dear God, shut my mouth to
[39:55] anything that would displease you. I
[39:58] realize I stand in one way in a dreadful
[40:02] place today. Any preacher that stands up
[40:05] behind this pullpit,
[40:08] not only this one, but different ones
[40:10] around the world, what a what a great
[40:13] thing it is. And yet, what a
[40:16] responsibility that goes with it. And if
[40:19] I get to it today, Lord, to read it to
[40:21] them, what your prophet said when he
[40:25] called this pulpit the sacred desk.
[40:29] A sacred desk, the closest thing to
[40:34] heaven
[40:36] on this earth,
[40:39] a pullpit.
[40:41] And dear God, I pray that you'd help me
[40:44] every time I stand, whether it's here or
[40:46] wherever else it is, help me to do it.
[40:48] with that knowledge. Lord, speak to us
[40:51] today. We pray in the name of Jesus. And
[40:55] the saint said,
[40:56] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be may be
[40:59] seated. [laughter]
[41:03] So, we've been looking today again. We
[41:07] want to pick it up at godliness.
[41:12] And we know that godliness is my
[41:15] goodness within a series that anybody
[41:18] could take on that word only and no
[41:21] telling how long that we would be able
[41:23] to go on it because to be godly to be
[41:27] like God would certainly be so many
[41:31] things.
[41:32] And yet we know that it's been made
[41:35] possible by him that we could have a
[41:39] godly nature, godly desires, godly
[41:42] behavior, and that which is pleasing to
[41:46] him in this life. And what I closed out
[41:50] with the last time that we looked at
[41:52] this about being godly was that God
[41:57] goes to church.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:01] Aren't you glad you believe God goes to
[42:03] church?
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you want to go to
[42:07] church?
[42:09] &gt;&gt; We'll read today again in Luke 4:E 16.
[42:12] And he came to Nazareth where he had
[42:15] been brought up. And as his custom was,
[42:21] his custom was, he went into the
[42:24] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[42:27] up for to read. I remember whenever
[42:31] Jesus would have went to church and
[42:33] started going there in the synagogue as
[42:36] a little boy being dedicated in the
[42:38] temple but there was only one temple but
[42:41] there were all kinds of little towns and
[42:43] villages so each one of them couldn't
[42:45] have a temple so they did have a
[42:48] synagogue so a synagogue was a place
[42:50] which a multi multi-purpose building
[42:53] they would have gatherings and this and
[42:55] that in it but no sacrifice so there was
[42:58] no blood no mercy mercy seat, no shakina
[43:01] glory, no law, no Torah, no Mishna,
[43:04] nothing there as far as divine
[43:07] supernatural. And remember remember
[43:09] these guys would get up and they they
[43:11] take the scroll and they'd stand and
[43:13] read it and read it and comment on it.
[43:15] The bar bar mitzvah would have been held
[43:18] there when a boy turned 12 years old and
[43:20] for the first time he would be allowed
[43:22] to take the scroll and read it publicly.
[43:24] He was considered to be a man when he
[43:26] could do that. So there would have been
[43:29] as far as we have a record of no
[43:31] miracles, nobody got saved, uh nobody
[43:35] got healed, nobody got delivered, but
[43:39] Jesus was faithful to go to church in so
[43:42] much that Luke wrote this many years
[43:45] after the Lord Jesus had left the earth
[43:47] and said that it was his custom. It was
[43:51] his custom to go to church. So if the
[43:54] Lord Jesus would have went to church in
[43:57] that day and there was no move of God at
[44:00] all, I wonder what he'd do today.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Now think of it. You'd never see a move
[44:06] of God. It would be the same thing over
[44:09] and over and over again. So they would
[44:11] have the people that would sing the
[44:13] songs and the women was on one side, the
[44:15] men on the other. And the women were
[44:17] never allowed to even stand in the
[44:19] pulpit. They were never allowed to take
[44:21] the Torah and read it openly. They were
[44:23] not allowed to do any of that,
[44:24] participate, only behind a little veil
[44:27] that would have been there. But Jesus
[44:29] was an habitual worshipper in the
[44:34] synagogue. So, it's something about him.
[44:37] Now, remember, wonder if he ever got
[44:39] anything when he went there. Wonder if
[44:42] he got anything out of the service.
[44:45] Well, you know, if Jesus was the word
[44:48] and they would at least stand up and
[44:50] read the word, no doubt he could have
[44:53] got something out of the service. I
[44:56] figure that if you and I go with the
[44:57] right attitude, we can get at least
[45:00] something out of the service. Now, Luke
[45:03] leads up here to a very phenomenal time
[45:06] in Jesus' life. And it's a it's kind of
[45:09] a dispensational change because he's
[45:11] going to take the word and the priest
[45:13] handed him the word. Now, this is not
[45:15] the first time it's happened, of course,
[45:17] but it's the first time that something
[45:19] like this is going to happen. So, he
[45:21] finds a place in the scroll, and it's
[45:24] Isaiah 61. And he read, and you remember
[45:27] what Jesus said, "This day, this
[45:29] scripture is fulfilled." And Luke 4:20,
[45:33] he closed the book and gave it again to
[45:36] the minister, and sat down, and the eyes
[45:38] of all of them that were in the
[45:40] synagogue were fastened on him. And he
[45:43] be to say unto them, "This day is this
[45:46] scripture fulfilled in your ears." Now
[45:50] Jesus goes on from there. That within
[45:52] itself would have been overwhelming. But
[45:54] he goes on in several more verses and
[45:57] tells them some more things. Now listen
[46:00] what happens in this church service.
[46:03] Chapter 4 28. And all they in the
[46:07] synagogue when they heard these things
[46:10] were filled with wrath.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; What a church service.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; And rose up
[46:21] and thrust him out
[46:24] of the city.
[46:27] Now Carol and I stood there a few years
[46:29] ago
[46:30] where this happened right there in the
[46:32] little village of Nazareth.
[46:34] So they had a little synagogue that they
[46:37] had rebuilt there. They had a well, they
[46:40] had a wine press. Very, very neat place.
[46:43] But there's a a precipice
[46:46] out from where the synagogue was, a real
[46:50] steep place with rocks and brambles and
[46:54] all types of things like that. Now, this
[46:57] is the way the service ended.
[47:01] And they all in the synagogue when they
[47:03] heard these things were filled with
[47:04] wrath and rose up and thrust him out of
[47:07] the city and led him unto the brow of
[47:11] the hill where on their city was built.
[47:14] So Nazareth's up in a little high place
[47:16] and then they lead him out to that brow
[47:18] and it's straight down like this
[47:22] that they might cast him down
[47:25] headlong.
[47:29] I wonder if Jesus ever went back to
[47:31] church after they throwed him out.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; He actually did.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact,
[47:39] he's used to getting thrown out.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And you know what Jesus does, unlike us?
[47:46] Jesus keeps on going back.
[47:49] Now, I want to ask every one of us here
[47:51] today, if any of us would have been
[47:54] treated like this,
[47:56] &gt;&gt; would we have ever went back to church
[48:00] again?
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Or you say, "I never would." See, that
[48:07] shows you're lacking
[48:09] &gt;&gt; that portion of God in your life
[48:12] &gt;&gt; because Jesus went back. Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, Jesus has kept
[48:17] going back
[48:19] &gt;&gt; for over 2,000 years since this
[48:21] happened.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; The churches are still throwing him out.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; He's been invited all over the Tri
[48:30] Cities this morning.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; No doubt churches everywhere, every
[48:35] denomination that there is here, every
[48:37] independent church. No doubt they w they
[48:40] invited him to come. But then do they
[48:43] welcome him once he shows up.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Now you see there's a difference in us
[48:50] standing and somebody will come and
[48:51] pray, "Oh Lord, we invite you to this
[48:54] service. Please come Lord Jesus." And
[48:57] then would we turn him loose to have his
[49:01] will in the service.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now notice this is what
[49:08] Jesus does. It wasn't his time yet. So
[49:10] the scripture says, "But he passing
[49:12] through the midst of them went his way."
[49:18] Now the Lord Jesus instead of getting
[49:21] this attitude toward church and saying,
[49:23] "You know what? I ain't never going back
[49:25] again. I ain't never going back to
[49:28] church. Are you kidding me? I'd go there
[49:30] to help them and they'd lead me up to
[49:32] the brow there and they're going to
[49:33] throw me over and they would have done
[49:35] it had it been time, but it just wasn't
[49:37] time. But instead of Jesus getting
[49:40] burned out on church and I'm so sick and
[49:43] tired of preachers, I'm so fed up with
[49:46] lay people. I'm I'm just fed up with the
[49:48] whole church thing.
[49:50] Jesus is still going to churches where
[49:53] he's not even welcome.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus this day on Sunday
[50:00] has visited with his presence
[50:04] thousands times, thousands of churches,
[50:07] right? And how many of them let him have
[50:10] his way?
[50:13] &gt;&gt; I guess the question is, will we?
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Is Jesus free in Word of Life Church
[50:20] today to have his will or do we want to
[50:23] put him in a box and say, "Now, Lord,
[50:26] you can't do this, but you can do that,
[50:28] but you can't do this, and you can't do
[50:30] that."
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[50:34] Notice this in the sermon that the
[50:36] prophet entitled Pride
[50:39] Campbellville, Kentucky. Some of you
[50:41] were there with me at this setting uh
[50:43] several years ago when brother Charlie
[50:45] Cox had some meetings there and they had
[50:47] a tent set up when brother Random was
[50:50] there. It was a Methodist campground.
[50:52] Sister Nelly uh the Lord dealt with her
[50:56] that service and she gave her heart to
[50:58] God after this service right here. Jesus
[51:02] unnoticed.
[51:04] Jesus with dirty feet made a gazing
[51:08] stock after being invited. Now, you
[51:13] know, to me, it would be awful if people
[51:15] just said, "Look, you know what, Lord?
[51:17] We're having this thing called the
[51:19] church, but we're not even going to
[51:20] invite you, okay? We hear that you're a
[51:23] miracle worker. We hear that you'll make
[51:24] people shout sometimes, and we hear that
[51:27] you'll make them cry, and we hear you'll
[51:29] make them do all sorts of things." and
[51:31] we really don't want that in our place.
[51:34] So, we're not even going to invite you.
[51:35] Okay? Just stay out of our assembly. But
[51:38] the sad part about it is they say he's
[51:41] welcome, but if he come in and started
[51:43] doing any of the above things I just
[51:45] lift listed, they wouldn't want him back
[51:47] anymore.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; So, they invite him, but he's not
[51:52] welcome. Can you imagine how rude that
[51:55] would be to be treated in such a way
[51:57] that someone here in the church or a
[51:59] family member or friend of yours would
[52:01] invite you for supper.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; You walk in the door, you smell it,
[52:07] there's the bread, there's the meat, you
[52:09] can smell the potatoes, the carrots,
[52:12] this or that. And they they let you in
[52:14] and they don't speak to you after that.
[52:16] They tell you, "Sit down right there."
[52:20] them and their family goes to the table.
[52:23] They go to start eating and that aroma
[52:26] is filling your their house and you and
[52:29] your family are sitting in the living
[52:31] room looking at one another and trying
[52:33] to figure out what what what is
[52:36] happening. We thought that we were
[52:39] welcome here. No, you were invited, but
[52:42] you wasn't really welcome.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; So, they sat there and eat and talk
[52:46] about how good it is. past the butter
[52:49] and past the carrots and and past the
[52:51] mashed potatoes and gravy and oh, this
[52:54] is so good. They never acknowledge you.
[52:57] They never look at you.
[53:00] How long would you all stay?
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; You going to stay for dessert?
[53:09] Not that you're going to get any, but
[53:11] you're going to let them eat it in front
[53:13] of you and your children. Now you all
[53:15] are hungry and you haven't eaten for
[53:17] [clears throat] a while and you saw
[53:23] you thought
[53:27] that you was going to be part of this.
[53:32] So Jesus come to the service here today.
[53:37] He's hoping to be a part of this
[53:40] service.
[53:41] He's wanting to be the object of our
[53:45] worship,
[53:46] &gt;&gt; the main reason that we come here,
[53:49] &gt;&gt; not to see one another. That's well and
[53:52] good, but that's not the reason we're
[53:54] here.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; It's to worship him.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[53:59] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Notice the way the prophet lays this
[54:03] out. I wonder when you have a prayer
[54:06] meeting and you invite him to your
[54:07] church and then he comes down to do
[54:10] something for you and you just let him
[54:13] be unentertained.
[54:16] Too much of that in our home life and
[54:20] everywhere. When the president comes,
[54:23] why am I? They throw out the carpet all
[54:25] the way from the train all the way into
[54:27] the hotel. They they stroll the streets
[54:32] and young ladies will go forth for
[54:34] flowers and the bouquet the sidewalks
[54:36] and hang down the flags and every sign
[54:39] of welcome. But when Jesus comes to to
[54:42] town, he has to stay in a little mission
[54:46] somewhere. He'll be called crazy holy
[54:50] roller Jesus
[54:53] with dirty feet.
[54:56] There he sits unentertained,
[54:59] unwashed,
[55:01] unwelcomed.
[55:03] And you say, "Jesus, do you take a
[55:05] lesser place?
[55:07] Jesus, do you take a little bitty place
[55:11] when you're called in a home?" Yes,
[55:15] I take that little place. What?
[55:19] the little room in the upstairs or
[55:21] perhaps maybe on the second floor or the
[55:25] little closet or down in the basement.
[55:29] You're ashamed of him before the
[55:32] celebrity, before your company.
[55:36] You're afraid or ashamed to testify of
[55:39] him, to tell of his saving
[55:43] grace.
[55:46] May God help us. Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; But will you come anyhow, Jesus?
[55:56] Yeah, I will come anyhow.
[56:00] That proves to me he's the Lord of
[56:02] Lords.
[56:05] He's a big person.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; I'll come anyhow,
[56:11] no matter just how little of a place you
[56:15] will make for me. Don't you understand?
[56:18] That's the way he'll do in our service.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; That's the way he'll do in our life.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; So he allocates so much time for our
[56:27] life on the earth.
[56:30] And he wants to give us our life and our
[56:32] time and not not make us a robot to
[56:35] where that he programs us and we go here
[56:38] and we do there and we we pray and we
[56:40] read our Bible and then but he wants to
[56:42] give us time and then give us choice
[56:46] and wants us to choose in the right
[56:48] balance of work and pleasure and all of
[56:52] that and him. This is why he ends up
[56:56] shortch changed so much
[57:00] because of our own choice.
[57:03] and we go here and we do that and we do
[57:05] this and do that and the other and we
[57:07] give Jesus this little tiny bit in our
[57:11] life
[57:13] &gt;&gt; and Jesus
[57:15] will take it and hug it up as it were so
[57:19] close to him
[57:20] &gt;&gt; and look back at you and say, "Thank
[57:23] you.
[57:26] Thank you for that 30 minutes that you
[57:29] gave me.
[57:31] I really do
[57:34] appreciate it
[57:37] cuz I love spending time with you.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; I love hearing you talk to me. I love
[57:45] hear you singing to me. I love hearing
[57:47] you testify to me.
[57:51] Thank you.
[58:04] No matter how little of a place you'll
[58:06] make for me, I'll come anyhow.
[58:10] I like that.
[58:12] He's my Lord and I will come anyhow. No
[58:15] matter how little the place is, I will
[58:18] come. Though you give the president
[58:21] everything,
[58:23] you give Dr. Jones, a great spread. But
[58:25] when Jesus comes, he takes a corner
[58:28] somewhere.
[58:30] What a bunch of Pharisees.
[58:33] Put on entertainers. No love
[58:36] entertainers.
[58:37] I will take that place. You know the
[58:39] prophet said, "One of the greatest
[58:40] privileges that you and I have been
[58:42] given in our life is to entertain
[58:47] Jesus Christ."
[58:49] Now, y'all should be able to say amen to
[58:51] that cuz most human beings love either
[58:55] one form or another of entertainment.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Now, whether it's reading, whether it's
[59:01] your phone, whether it's movies, whether
[59:04] it's music, whatever sports, everybody
[59:08] has some for form of entertainment. To
[59:11] some, it's Instagram, it's this and that
[59:14] and the other. It's cooking, it's, you
[59:16] know, whatever it is. Is it wrong? No,
[59:19] not necessarily. A lot of entertainment
[59:21] does not. It's not sin of itself, but
[59:24] it's sin into what we make it into in
[59:26] our lives.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; And then the only entertainment that
[59:30] Jesus has has that he asks for is for us
[59:35] to entertain him.
[59:39] Actually, something angels cannot do.
[59:41] And God knows they would do a much
[59:43] better job than I could ever do. and
[59:46] they would be so honored to do it. But
[59:50] yet Jesus has allowed so much
[59:52] entertainment to himself, to the church,
[59:55] and if we don't do it, it don't get
[59:58] done.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Revelation 3 20. One of the
[1:00:06] saddest scriptures in the Bible.
[1:00:10] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:00:12] And if any man hear my voice and open
[1:00:14] the door, I will come into him and will
[1:00:17] s. And the word there, s is short for
[1:00:20] supper.
[1:00:22] I will have supper with him. You see,
[1:00:26] this is where we are. Jesus didn't say
[1:00:30] breakfast.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Why? This verse of scripture applies to
[1:00:36] the last day. It's supper time.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus ain't offering you breakfast. He
[1:00:43] ain't offering you lunch. You're in the
[1:00:45] supper time, the end time.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is wanting to have supper with
[1:00:52] all of us. I will come into him and
[1:00:54] we'll have supper with him and he with
[1:00:58] me. Now listen how the prophet picks
[1:01:00] this up and he says in this led us to
[1:01:02] sin church age it was the most messed up
[1:01:06] church age of all the rest of them. The
[1:01:09] most messed up of all the rest of them.
[1:01:12] And we found the most pathetic thing in
[1:01:15] the last part of the Leodysian church
[1:01:18] age. Notice not at the beginning at the
[1:01:21] last part of the Leodysian church age.
[1:01:25] Jesus standing on the outside of his own
[1:01:29] church
[1:01:32] where he had been put out knocking
[1:01:35] at the door trying to get back in.
[1:01:40] And you're talking about a sad
[1:01:42] situation.
[1:01:45] If I'm going somewhere and I'm going to
[1:01:47] be gone out preaching somewhere and I'm
[1:01:48] gone for a few days and I come back and
[1:01:51] I come over to the church and I'm gonna
[1:01:53] go in the office here and my key won't
[1:01:55] work.
[1:01:57] So I come around to that door and it
[1:01:59] won't work. Now I've got a master key.
[1:02:01] So it unlocks every door in here.
[1:02:05] But all of a sudden I find out my key
[1:02:07] won't let me in. No doors. I go to the
[1:02:09] main entrance won't let me in.
[1:02:13] I go to the handicap entrance, won't let
[1:02:15] me there. I go to the deacon store in
[1:02:16] the back, won't let me there.
[1:02:19] I go over here to the fellowship hall. I
[1:02:22] can't even get in anywhere.
[1:02:25] So, it's on Monday morning, 9:00. I call
[1:02:28] brother Jackie, brother Michael. Neither
[1:02:30] one of them will answer my phone calls.
[1:02:32] I text them. They won't even respond.
[1:02:36] And I'm thinking, what in the world? Did
[1:02:38] they have an election while I was gone?
[1:02:40] Yes.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Have they changed the locks on the door?
[1:02:44] Now, wouldn't that be sad to say, "Oh,
[1:02:46] you're no longer welcome here. Really?
[1:02:49] What have I done?"
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; What have I done to you all?
[1:02:54] Now, that would be heartbreaking for me
[1:02:56] as a man. But what is that in comparison
[1:02:59] to the Lord Jesus? So, HE TRIES HIS LAW.
[1:03:02] HE TRIES HIS KEY, it won't work. He
[1:03:04] tries mercy, that won't work. He tries
[1:03:06] grace, that won't work. He tries joy,
[1:03:08] tries deliverance, tries healing, none
[1:03:10] of it. Well, there they say, "No, no,
[1:03:12] no. We want your name and we want your
[1:03:16] city and we do not want to go to hell
[1:03:19] and we've gone, you've gone to prepare a
[1:03:21] place for us and we want that, but we
[1:03:24] don't want you being the boss of our
[1:03:26] lives."
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; So, if that's the way it is, we're
[1:03:31] changing the locks on our church door.
[1:03:35] Jesus.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; I wonder children, have we done that in
[1:03:42] our lives?
[1:03:46] NOTICE THIS JESUS ON THE OUTSIDE OF HIS
[1:03:49] own church where he'd been put out. Not
[1:03:51] at the beginning of the leis church age,
[1:03:53] brother Paul, but at the very end where
[1:03:55] we are. Do you understand? This is going
[1:03:58] to be part of the consummation of the
[1:04:00] judgment of God
[1:04:02] that the churches will put Jesus out.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; You said amen to that. But let me go a
[1:04:09] little bit farther. And it ain't going
[1:04:10] to be limited just to denominational
[1:04:12] churches either.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Message churches are going to do the
[1:04:15] same.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Not all of them.
[1:04:19] Notice he said trying to get back in.
[1:04:22] Isn't that sinful?
[1:04:26] I think that's about one of the most
[1:04:28] pathetic scriptures I've ever read.
[1:04:30] Jesus outside of his own door and his
[1:04:33] church had put him out. His church
[1:04:37] had put him out and he was trying to get
[1:04:41] back in. You imagine knocking, let me
[1:04:44] in, please, church. I'm the one who
[1:04:47] bought you. I'm the ONE WHO SAVED YOU.
[1:04:49] I'M THE ONE THAT DELIVERED YOU FROM A
[1:04:51] LIFE OF sin and of hell and debauchery
[1:04:54] and darkness and filth and all that. Let
[1:04:55] Let me please.
[1:04:58] Will anybody let ME BACK IN? WHAT ABOUT
[1:05:00] WORD OF LIFE? CAN I COME IN THERE?
[1:05:04] WORD OF LIFE CHURCH. CAN I COME IN ON
[1:05:06] WEDNESDAY? CAN I come in in THE YOUTH
[1:05:08] SERVICE? CAN I COME IN ON SUNDAY? CAN I
[1:05:10] COME IN?
[1:05:14] Y'ALL GOING TO MAKE ME STAND OUT HERE
[1:05:16] AND LAY ON THE SEA WHERE THEY HATE ME
[1:05:18] AND THEY DESPISE MY NAME AND THEY
[1:05:20] RIDICULE ME AND THEY MAKE FUN OF MY
[1:05:22] WORD. Won't anybody give me a shelter?
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; I will. Lord,
[1:05:36] if any man that will open and let me
[1:05:39] back
[1:05:40] in my own house.
[1:05:44] How would you brothers feel if you come
[1:05:45] in from work tomorrow and your wife
[1:05:47] change the locks? You push your garage
[1:05:49] door and it no longer works. You go in
[1:05:52] the basement door and you can't get in
[1:05:53] there. You try the front door. You try
[1:05:55] the back door.
[1:05:57] And finally her and your children meet
[1:05:59] you at the door and say, "We don't want
[1:06:00] you here no more. You're not welcome."
[1:06:06] Would you keep on knocking, brothers?
[1:06:09] Would you keep on trying? Do we want to
[1:06:12] be godly or not?
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; You see, WHEN JESUS GETS turned down and
[1:06:17] put out, what does he do? He keeps
[1:06:20] coming back. I'll tell you one thing. If
[1:06:21] we had more people around this message
[1:06:23] that had that determination, the devil
[1:06:25] couldn't run you off. The preacher
[1:06:28] couldn't run you off, the deacons
[1:06:30] couldn't run you off, there ain't nobody
[1:06:32] going to run you off and run you away
[1:06:34] from the presence of God. But if you're
[1:06:37] a little BABY AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE
[1:06:40] PETTED AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A BOTTLE
[1:06:42] AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PACIFIER AND
[1:06:44] YOU WANT A PREACHER to change your
[1:06:46] stinking diaper and you want a preacher
[1:06:49] to baby you and make over you all the
[1:06:51] time, I'm afraid you're at the wrong
[1:06:53] place. God ain't looking for a bunch of
[1:06:56] babies. He's looking for an army. IT'S
[1:06:59] NOT AN ARMY OF BABIES AND INFANTS, but
[1:07:02] an army of God.
[1:07:07] Oh my, let me back in my own house. I'll
[1:07:10] suck with him. And he with me. And then
[1:07:13] the prophet said, "Isn't that pathetic?
[1:07:16] THE GOD OF HEAVEN PUT OUT OF HIS OWN
[1:07:19] CHURCH BY their creeds and denominations
[1:07:21] and the way that they're doing put them
[1:07:24] put him out of the church and accepted
[1:07:26] their creed." Again, it said Jesus
[1:07:29] Christ has been put out of his own
[1:07:31] church and standing knocking at the door
[1:07:35] trying to get back in and richness and
[1:07:38] pleasures of the world has drove him
[1:07:41] from the church until the church has
[1:07:43] become a lukewarm. It's a very pathetic
[1:07:47] picture of all the other churches in the
[1:07:51] church ages. And you know what's the
[1:07:52] amazing thing about it is Jesus still
[1:07:54] goes to church and HE'LL BE THERE. YOU
[1:07:58] KNOW WHAT I'm convinced this morning? If
[1:08:00] there were people that have already said
[1:08:02] their creeds and their dogmas and
[1:08:04] they've made Jesus not the person of the
[1:08:06] Godhead but the second one and they've
[1:08:08] took this from him and that from him and
[1:08:10] that from him. But no doubt he visited
[1:08:13] some of these churches around the Tri
[1:08:15] Cities area today and there may have
[1:08:18] been somebody that got saved.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:08:22] Oh, you say you mean they CAN GET SAVED?
[1:08:23] YES. THAT'S how much Jesus wants to
[1:08:27] visit people who have turned him down.
[1:08:30] How much more than will he visit those
[1:08:32] of us who want him here and all of his
[1:08:35] greatness and all of his power and all
[1:08:38] of his mercy. Oh my. I HOPE AND PRAY TO
[1:08:41] GOD THAT OUR church never ever gets to a
[1:08:44] spot to where we say, "Jesus, your
[1:08:47] miracles aren't welcome." Well, as long
[1:08:49] as I'm in the pastor, this is going to
[1:08:51] be our stand. Jesus healing is welcome
[1:08:54] here. JESUS MIRACLES ARE WELCOME HERE.
[1:08:58] JESUS DELIVERING THE LOST, IT'S WELCOME
[1:09:00] HERE. JESUS FILLING WITH THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:09:03] IT'S WELCOME HERE. Is that right,
[1:09:05] church?
[1:09:07] [applause]
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:09:14] He can't heal.
[1:09:16] He can't deliver.
[1:09:19] He can't tell them how to dress.
[1:09:21] He can't tell them what he demands of
[1:09:23] them because they don't want to hear it.
[1:09:26] So this you leave that alone. This is
[1:09:29] our private lives and you stay out of my
[1:09:32] private life.
[1:09:35] Oh my. BUT YOU SEE A LOT OF MESSAGE
[1:09:38] PEOPLE,
[1:09:40] they don't invite him to their church
[1:09:46] because they don't believe in going to
[1:09:47] church.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; So they don't invite him. As a matter of
[1:09:53] fact, they are guilty of abandoning
[1:09:57] him.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; They don't invite him. And you know the
[1:10:02] sad part about it is they take the
[1:10:05] message of the hour, this precious
[1:10:08] message,
[1:10:10] and try to prove their false doctrine
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; by the very message of God that's
[1:10:17] restored the hearts of the children of
[1:10:19] God in the last days. Are you talking
[1:10:22] about something that you're going to try
[1:10:24] to take the message of the hour and use
[1:10:28] the message to disprove scripture?
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:10:35] together as a manner of some is
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; and the church said
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; now let's look at let's look at David.
[1:10:44] So to be godly a person a person should
[1:10:48] have a desire to go to the house of God.
[1:10:52] Now I'm convinced friends that a lot of
[1:10:54] the message people have either lost
[1:10:58] or never had
[1:11:01] the respect for the house of God.
[1:11:06] And they're raising a if if time goes on
[1:11:09] for this younger generation in the way
[1:11:12] that many message people are teaching
[1:11:14] their children about church, it won't be
[1:11:17] but a few more years they will ridicule
[1:11:19] it and laugh at it. Some are already
[1:11:21] doing it now. AND WHAT IS THAT MISSING?
[1:11:25] THE sacredness
[1:11:27] of what it means to come to the house of
[1:11:29] God.
[1:11:32] Notice in Psalms 5:7,
[1:11:36] "But as for me, I will come into thy
[1:11:40] house, in the multitude of thy mercy,
[1:11:44] and in thy fear will I worship toward
[1:11:47] thy holy temple." Now remember, there
[1:11:50] was not even a solid structure in the
[1:11:54] days of David when he said that. It was
[1:11:57] a tent.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; A TENT. But David knew there was
[1:12:01] something that God had a house. And he
[1:12:05] said, "I will come in." He could never
[1:12:07] even enter in behind the veil and go
[1:12:10] into the Holy of Holies. He was only
[1:12:12] allowed in the outer court. But he
[1:12:14] recognized being there was so sacred and
[1:12:19] so holy and so righteous.
[1:12:24] Listen as he goes on in Psalms 26:8.
[1:12:26] Lord, I have loved the hab the
[1:12:29] habitation of thy house and the place
[1:12:32] where thine honor dwellest. 654 Blessed
[1:12:37] is the man whom thou chooses and cause
[1:12:40] us to approach UNTO THEE, THAT HE MAY
[1:12:42] DWELL IN THY COURTS, NOT EVEN IN THE
[1:12:46] Holy of Holies, but a person that would
[1:12:48] be allowed to dwell in the courts of
[1:12:51] God.
[1:12:52] IN THY COURTS, WE SHALL BE SATISFIED
[1:12:55] WITH the goodness
[1:12:58] of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
[1:13:02] PSALM 66:13, I WILL GO INTO THY HOUSE
[1:13:06] WITH BURNT OFFERINGS. I will pay thee my
[1:13:10] vows. Psalms 84:1. TO THE CHIEF MUSICIAN
[1:13:14] UPON GATIS, a psalm for the SONS OF
[1:13:18] KORA. HOW AMIABLE,
[1:13:21] HOW amiable
[1:13:23] are thy tabernacles,
[1:13:25] oh Lord of hosts. Now remember he make
[1:13:28] uses the word in plural form tabernacles
[1:13:30] because there was three dimensions or
[1:13:33] three spheres of the tabernacle. How
[1:13:36] amiable are thy tabernacles. Look in
[1:13:40] Hebrews 9:2. For there was a tabernacle
[1:13:43] made, the first wherein was the
[1:13:45] candlestick, and the table, and the
[1:13:47] sheerbread, which is called the
[1:13:49] sanctuary. And after the second veil,
[1:13:51] the tabernacle, so plural tabernacles in
[1:13:54] plural form, which is called the holiest
[1:13:57] OF ALL, WHICH HAD THE GOLDEN SENSOR, and
[1:14:00] the ark of the covenant overlaid
[1:14:02] roundabout with gold. Look, and you
[1:14:04] talking about David THOUGHT THIS WAS SO
[1:14:08] HOLY AND SO GODLY and so righteous and
[1:14:12] it was just things. [snorts]
[1:14:16] BUT IT WAS THINGS THAT HAD BEEN
[1:14:19] CONSECRATED TO GOD. And it WAS THINGS
[1:14:22] THAT GOD SAID, "I WANT this and I want
[1:14:24] that and I want that." And David knew
[1:14:27] they were there, ALTHOUGH HE NEVER GOT
[1:14:29] TO SEE THEM. HIS EYES COULD NEVER BEHOLD
[1:14:32] THEM. BUT HE SAID THIS IS THE
[1:14:34] FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S WORD AND IT IS SO
[1:14:37] HOLY. IT IS SO SACRED.
[1:14:40] I wonder children
[1:14:42] when we come to the house of God have we
[1:14:46] who even believe in going to church lost
[1:14:49] some of our sacredness
[1:14:55] and respect for the place that has been
[1:14:59] dedicated to God.
[1:15:05] Notice in verse 5, and over the
[1:15:06] cherubams of glory shadowing the mercy
[1:15:09] seat of which we cannot now speak
[1:15:12] particularly. PSALMS 84:2,
[1:15:15] MY SOUL LONGETH. YEAH. YAY. Even
[1:15:18] faintth.
[1:15:20] MY SOUL LONGETH. Even faintest.
[1:15:24] The word here means to PALE OR TO BE
[1:15:28] FAINT or weak. to pine after, TO LONG
[1:15:34] FOR, TO [screaming] DESIRE EARNESTLY.
[1:15:39] MY SOUL LONGS. YOU MEAN HE HE WANTED
[1:15:42] JUST TO GET UP TO THE TABERNACLE?
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And he FELT LIKE HE WAS GOING TO PASS
[1:15:49] OUT
[1:15:50] IF he didn't get to go to church.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; He was pining.
[1:15:56] HE WAS SAD. HE FELT LIKE I I'M GOING TO
[1:15:59] PASS OUT. I'M GOING TO PASS OUT. OH NO.
[1:16:02] OH NO. WHAT IS IT, DAVID? YOU AIN'T EAT.
[1:16:04] WHAT IS IT, DAVID? YOUR HIGH BLOOD. YOUR
[1:16:05] LOW BLOOD. NO. [screaming] NO. NO. I
[1:16:08] CAN'T GO TO CHURCH.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if David would have been
[1:16:17] allowed to live in Johnson City
[1:16:21] in 2025?
[1:16:24] And this was David's home church. The
[1:16:27] deacons every service would have to set
[1:16:30] him down.
[1:16:33] He would be harping and jumping and
[1:16:35] shouting and running.
[1:16:37] And if they put HIM ON THE OUTSIDE, HE'D
[1:16:40] been running ON THE OUTSIDE.
[1:16:42] CAN YOU IMAGINE A MAN WITHOUT THE HOLY
[1:16:44] GHOST THAT LOVE just to go and see a
[1:16:46] tent
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; to SEE A TENT
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; AND KNOW THAT THERE WAS OTHER THINGS
[1:16:53] THERE BUT JUST TO BE THERE BECAUSE HE
[1:16:55] SENT YOU UNDERSTAND [screaming] MANY
[1:16:58] MESSAGE PEOPLE
[1:17:00] THEY'RE NOT GOD CONSCIOUS
[1:17:04] THIS IS WHAT DAVID [screaming] had
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; he could sense
[1:17:10] God there
[1:17:20] This word that David used expresses such
[1:17:22] a longing or desire to make one faint
[1:17:27] or exhausted
[1:17:30] with intent
[1:17:32] desire.
[1:17:34] And he said, "I'm going to pass out.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; David. King David. WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
[1:17:46] WHAT IS IT? I want to go to church so
[1:17:49] bad.
[1:17:53] I'm going to pass out if I don't get to
[1:17:55] church.
[1:17:58] Can't you see why Satan don't want you
[1:18:00] to go?
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; HE WON'T FIGHT YOU ABOUT GOING TO
[1:18:04] WALMART LIKE THAT.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; HE WON'T FIGHT YOU ABOUT GOING TO WORK
[1:18:08] LIKE THAT. COME ON, SOMEBODY. OH MY.
[1:18:11] [screaming] BUT TO GET IN GOD'S
[1:18:12] PRESENCE, TO GET IN THE HOUSE OF GOD,
[1:18:15] WHAT WOULD IT BE? WORD OF LIFE. IF EACH
[1:18:18] ONE OF US HAD SUCH A DESIRE AND
[1:18:21] ANTICIPATION TO COME TO THE HOUSE OF
[1:18:24] GOD.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:18:30] [applause]
[1:18:32] Oh, I'm so exhausted. I'm about to
[1:18:35] faint.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; If I can't go TO CHURCH, MY SOUL LONGER,
[1:18:41] YAY, FAINTEST
[1:18:43] FOR THE COURTS OF THE LORD. MY HEART AND
[1:18:46] MY flesh
[1:18:49] cry us out
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; for the living God.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, OUR WHOLE nature
[1:18:58] is benefited
[1:19:00] when we come to the house of God.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Your flesh will benefit, your spirit
[1:19:04] will benefit, and your soul DEFINITELY
[1:19:05] WILL BENEFIT. NOTICE DAVID, BUT JUST AN
[1:19:08] OLD TESTAMENT PERSPECTIVE.
[1:19:11] IT BENEFITED HIS SOUL. IT BENEFITED HIS
[1:19:14] FLESH.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; OUR WHOLE NATURE demands
[1:19:19] the fellowship
[1:19:21] of almighty God.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; BODY AND SOUL AND SPIRIT, we are made
[1:19:27] for the service of our king.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, he wants your soul. He wants your
[1:19:31] spirit. But he also wants your hands. He
[1:19:33] wants you to lift up holy hands before
[1:19:35] the Lord. He wants your VOCAL CORDS.
[1:19:38] AMEN. SHOUT WITH A VOICE OF TRIUMPH. IS
[1:19:40] THAT RIGHT? HE WANTS YOUR FEET.
[1:19:42] SOMETIMES PATTING THEM. PRAISE GOD.
[1:19:44] SOMETIMES DANCING THEM. HE WANTS YOUR
[1:19:46] SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL'S CHILDREN GET GIVE ALL theirs
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; to the devil. Why should not we give all
[1:19:56] of ours to God? Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; NOTICE HE SAID, "MY HEART AND MY FLESH
[1:20:01] CRITH out
[1:20:04] the cry of earnest longing and desire
[1:20:08] for the living God,
[1:20:11] not an idol.
[1:20:13] That's what I cry for,
[1:20:16] the living God."
[1:20:19] I don't want to just stand here and say
[1:20:20] for the rest of my life, where is the
[1:20:22] Lord God of Brother Random?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I don't want Where's
[1:20:27] the Lord God? Where's the Lord God of
[1:20:29] Paul? Where's the Lord God? I want to be
[1:20:31] able to say it like this. The Lord God
[1:20:33] is here. His presence is here. He's
[1:20:35] doing the same things he's always done.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's the living God I crave for.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Psalms 84:4, blessed are they
[1:20:47] that dwell in thy house.
[1:20:50] They will still be praising thee.
[1:20:53] Silah. Verse 10. FOR A DAY IN THY courts
[1:20:58] is better than a thousand.
[1:21:02] I'd rather be a doorkeeper
[1:21:05] in the house of my God to dwell in tents
[1:21:11] of wickedness. JUST A DOORKEEPER.
[1:21:14] SOMEBODY THAT COME TO CHURCH AND SWEEP
[1:21:16] THE LEAVES OUT FROM THE DOOR AND SEE
[1:21:18] CHEWING GUM PAPERS OUT ON THE PARKING
[1:21:19] LOT, YOU KNOW, JUST PICK UP THIS AND
[1:21:21] SAY, "OH MY, IT'S SUCH AN HONOR. I'M SO
[1:21:23] GLAD TO BE THE TRASH BOY. I'M SO GLAD TO
[1:21:25] BE THE LEAF BLOWING CHURCH BECAUSE GOD'S
[1:21:28] HOLY PRESENCE, THIS IS A PLACE
[1:21:30] CONSECRATED to the presence OF GOD. AND
[1:21:32] AS LONG AS THE BRIDE'S HERE AND WE NEED
[1:21:34] IT, HIS PRESENCE WILL ALWAYS BE HERE,
[1:21:37] FRIENDS. OH YEAH. OH, IT CAN BE IN MY
[1:21:39] HOME, TOO. IT CAN BE IN YOUR HOME. YES.
[1:21:42] BUT IT'S NOT the same.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Psalms 122 verse1, a song of
[1:21:52] degrees of David.
[1:21:56] I was so sad and I was so troubled and I
[1:22:01] was so disappointed.
[1:22:04] I was glad when they said unto me, "Let
[1:22:09] us go into the house of the Lord,"
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; which was a tent in that day. Yeah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine David being able to walk
[1:22:20] in here and the brothers up here on
[1:22:22] their musical instruments and singing
[1:22:24] and you all clapping [applause] your
[1:22:26] hands and worshiping God? And as soon as
[1:22:28] David entered in, he sensed that
[1:22:30] presence of God. Oh my, what in the
[1:22:33] world would David done? You talking
[1:22:35] about a dancing little David? If David
[1:22:38] could dance under the law, what could he
[1:22:40] do under grace? I wish somebody would
[1:22:42] preach with me this morning. BUT WHAT
[1:22:44] ABOUT THOSE OF US that love the Lord
[1:22:46] Jesus? Hey, I don't believe David loved
[1:22:49] him any more than SOME OF YOU RIGHT HERE
[1:22:51] TODAY. I BELIEVE WHAT WE need is an
[1:22:53] awakening in our walk with God and a
[1:22:56] REALITY WHEN WE COME TOGETHER. HOW
[1:22:59] SACRED, HOW HOLY, HOW PRIVILEGED WE ARE
[1:23:03] AS A PEOPLE OF GOD THAT WE CAN COME
[1:23:06] TOGETHER AND SAY, "YES, LORD, MOVE AMONG
[1:23:08] YOUR PEOPLE. THEY'RE SICK HERE TODAY.
[1:23:11] GOD, HEAL THEM. THERE'S LOST HERE TODAY.
[1:23:13] SAVE THEM. PEOPLE NEED THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:23:15] FILL THEM, LORD.
[1:23:21] Oh my.
[1:23:25] But I want you to think, friends,
[1:23:28] now watch the prophet.
[1:23:30] I I've I've I've looked at this message
[1:23:32] right here through the years. I couldn't
[1:23:34] tell you how many times that I've
[1:23:35] studied it and looked at it, but somehow
[1:23:38] another, I've totally missed this quote.
[1:23:40] I'm fixing to read you.
[1:23:42] AND STANDING HERE AT THIS BIBLE on the
[1:23:45] sacred desk. Now listen,
[1:23:55] sacred desk.
[1:24:00] Now show me where brother Ram said your
[1:24:01] kitchen table was sacred
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; or your coffee table or your end table
[1:24:07] where your MP3 player lays.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, if you're going to make
[1:24:11] him the voice of God and say what is it
[1:24:13] said, either you take this the same way
[1:24:15] as that, or you're a filthy hypocrite,
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; preach, brother Donnie,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; STANDING HERE WITH THIS BIBLE ON THE
[1:24:26] SACRED DESK, THE PULL PIT,
[1:24:29] THE CLOSEST PLACE TO heaven
[1:24:34] on the earth.
[1:24:39] So you mean a pulpit where men of God
[1:24:42] come and stand and preach the WORD IS
[1:24:45] THE CLOSEST place to heaven
[1:24:49] on earth
[1:24:53] and then people don't want to go
[1:24:56] and be around that place the closest
[1:24:59] place to heaven on earth.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah somebody.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:07] I TELL YOU, IT SHOULDN'T JUST AFFECT the
[1:25:09] leoty, but it should affect the ministry
[1:25:11] as well.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; TO REALIZE WHEN A PREACHER WALKS UP
[1:25:15] BEHIND THIS PLACE OR WHEREVER it is that
[1:25:16] HE'S PREACHING. OH MAN, WE'RE NOT
[1:25:18] INTERESTED IN A BUNCH OF IDEOLOGIES.
[1:25:20] WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN A BUNCH of I
[1:25:22] this and I've done that and I've DONE
[1:25:24] SOMETHING ELSE. BRING US JESUS, BROTHER.
[1:25:27] DON'T BRING YOUR AGENDA. DON'T BRING
[1:25:29] YOUR THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER. I GET SO
[1:25:31] SICK AND TIRED OF PREACHERS AND USING
[1:25:33] THE PULLPIT as a PLACE TO GET BACK AT
[1:25:35] PEOPLE AND GET BACK AT ONE ANOTHER.
[1:25:37] THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S TO
[1:25:40] BRING JESUS CHRIST TO THE CHILDREN OF
[1:25:43] GOD. IT'S TO LET THE PEOPLE SEE JESUS IS
[1:25:47] NOT DEAD. [screaming]
[1:25:49] HE'S [laughter] ALIVE.
[1:25:51] [applause]
[1:25:56] I wonder if the message ministers
[1:25:57] wouldn't be more sincere themselves
[1:26:02] and respect this holy place more if it
[1:26:05] wouldn't bring right on out to the
[1:26:07] leoty.
[1:26:09] Think about what a statement AS I STAND
[1:26:11] YOU with this Bible on the sacred desk.
[1:26:13] Check it out. Study it sometime and he
[1:26:15] gets times he uses this terms over and
[1:26:17] over again. SACRED DESK, THE PULPIT, THE
[1:26:20] CLOSEST PLACE TO HEAVEN ON EARTH.
[1:26:24] WOW.
[1:26:28] Listen to this. In the supernatural,
[1:26:29] many times defining our own ranks of
[1:26:33] Pentecost.
[1:26:35] Sometimes our atmosphere becomes an
[1:26:38] emotion
[1:26:39] instead of a worship and THAT SOON DIES
[1:26:43] out and the members become one thing and
[1:26:45] another. But if we could ever get a
[1:26:47] group of people
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; together
[1:26:52] WHERE WAS GENUINE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:26:54] ATMOSPHERE, A sacredness
[1:26:58] and a sincerity
[1:27:00] and worship
[1:27:03] men and women, hallelujah, SITTING IN
[1:27:06] THERE ARE GOD
[1:27:09] CONSCIOUS.
[1:27:13] Now notice the word that HE USES GOD
[1:27:15] CONSCIENCE. NOT YOUR HUMAN CONSCIENCE
[1:27:19] BUT GOD CONSCIENCE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU
[1:27:21] RECOGNIZE GOD is there. Oh my. SITTING
[1:27:25] IN THERE OUR GOD CONSCIENCE AND KNOW
[1:27:28] THAT THE GREAT OMNIPOTENT [screaming]
[1:27:30] GOD is present ready to do all things
[1:27:34] without one shadow of a doubt and even
[1:27:37] HAVE AN EFFECT UPON THE UNBELIEVERS ARE
[1:27:39] SETTING in this evening. YOU CAN NEVER
[1:27:42] COME INTO THAT GLORY TO GOD ATMOSPHERE
[1:27:46] WITHOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; How many knows that's the truth by
[1:27:50] experience?
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. THIS IS A dedication of
[1:27:55] a church
[1:27:57] of a brother down in Cleveland,
[1:27:59] Tennessee in 1959.
[1:28:02] And we know that the church, the spirit
[1:28:04] of God is in the people that makes the
[1:28:06] church. But we also have places,
[1:28:10] GATHERING PLACES DEDICATED WHERE THIS
[1:28:14] church body
[1:28:17] gathers together to worship God.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; AH, YOU SEE THEN FOR THOSE WHO JUST MAKE
[1:28:23] IT THE SPIRITUAL PART, the mystical
[1:28:26] body, well, we are the body of Christ
[1:28:28] and we no longer need to meet together.
[1:28:30] That's not what he's saying.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; And word of life said,
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS GIVEN TO OUR PRECIOUS
[1:28:39] brethren and to this congregation this
[1:28:41] most beautiful structure. Therefore, we
[1:28:45] are here this morning FOR THAT PURPOSE
[1:28:47] TO DEDICATE IT TO BE A place of worship
[1:28:50] to the Lord our God.
[1:28:56] So, did brother Brandham look at church
[1:28:57] buildings as just any other building,
[1:29:00] any other type of building, or was there
[1:29:02] something special or sacred about a
[1:29:06] church,
[1:29:08] things that are to be my I felt honored
[1:29:11] tonight
[1:29:12] to come into a church like this, which
[1:29:14] if you don't know, it was an Assembly of
[1:29:17] God church.
[1:29:22] I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER in a church than I
[1:29:27] do in those auditoriums.
[1:29:31] Well, praise the Lord. My my there's
[1:29:35] nothing AGAINST THE AUDITORIUM, BUT YOU
[1:29:37] KNOW, maybe just a superstition. Seems
[1:29:39] like to me a truth. YOU GO INTO THOSE
[1:29:42] AUDITORIUMS WHERE THERE'S FIGHTS,
[1:29:44] RRESTLES, BURLESQUE, everything else
[1:29:47] going on. Evil spirits seem to hang
[1:29:49] around them places. NOW THAT MAY BE SEEM
[1:29:52] to be a superstition, but it isn't. SO,
[1:29:55] BUT WHEN YOU come into a church,
[1:29:59] YOU FOLKS READ YOUR BIBLE AT HOME,
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO TAPES AT HOME, READ THE
[1:30:05] MESSAGE AT HOME, PRAY AT HOME, TALK
[1:30:08] ABOUT THE LORD AT HOME.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; WELL, WHY CAN'T WE ALL JUST START
[1:30:15] STAYING HOME THEN?
[1:30:20] Because this part of the message tells
[1:30:22] us otherwise.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A PLACE THAT WE
[1:30:28] HAVE HALLOWED and set aside
[1:30:32] for worship.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:30:39] the presence
[1:30:41] of God
[1:30:44] is there.
[1:30:46] You know, it seems
[1:30:49] to be different. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
[1:30:51] EFFECT THE BUILDING HAS. It's where the
[1:30:54] people are congregating. OF COURSE, THE
[1:30:56] SAME people
[1:30:58] are at the other place, but on those
[1:31:01] evil grounds.
[1:31:04] So, in y'all's homes, there's never any
[1:31:06] arguing, right?
[1:31:10] Never any fussing.
[1:31:13] Uh, testing one, two, one, two, testing
[1:31:15] one, two.
[1:31:18] So, IN YOUR HOME, IT'S TOTAL CONSECRATED
[1:31:20] TO GOD. Y'ALL JUST OFFERING sacrifices
[1:31:22] and praising God all day long and just
[1:31:24] worshiping and everything. There's
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; ah, that could be one reason it feels
[1:31:31] different in church.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:31:41] Can I go a little longer?
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Boy, it seems hot in here this morning.
[1:31:47] Man, a lot of I'm sweating like I don't
[1:31:48] know what. Is it just me?
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; AND AS I SAID, BROTHER BRANDON talked to
[1:31:55] some preacher and he was talking about
[1:31:56] having a hard time getting his people to
[1:31:58] come to church. Said he had to get them
[1:32:00] to sign a card, you know, would they at
[1:32:02] least come on Easter and Christmas. AND
[1:32:04] I SAID, "YOU GET that bunch of lukewarm
[1:32:07] church members down to the altar and let
[1:32:10] them pray through till the Holy Ghost
[1:32:13] sets their soul of fire. There'll be no
[1:32:16] signing cards. GOD'S IN THEIR HEART. GOD
[1:32:20] [screaming] GOES TO CHURCH."
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW, CHILDREN. LET'S SAY WHAT
[1:32:27] THE TAPE SAY. LET'S PRESS [screaming]
[1:32:29] PLAY. AND WHEN THIS QUOTE IS SAID, LET'S
[1:32:32] ALL SAY AMEN.
[1:32:36] AND NOT LET'S NOT JUST SAY IT WITH OUR
[1:32:38] VOICE, BUT LET'S SAY IT WITH OUR FEET.
[1:32:41] LET OUR FEET TAKE US TO THE HOUSE OF GOD
[1:32:45] BECAUSE GOD GOES TO CHURCH.
[1:32:50] WOO! [cheering]
[1:32:52] [applause]
[1:32:53] My my but as I read this quote, I
[1:32:56] couldn't keep from wondering if we ain't
[1:32:57] got a lot of message folks like this
[1:33:00] brother had in his church. You get that
[1:33:02] bunch of lukewarm church members down to
[1:33:04] the altar, let them pray through till
[1:33:06] the Holy Ghost SETS THEIR SOUL OF FIRE.
[1:33:09] THERE'LL BE NO SIGNING CARDS. GOD'S IN
[1:33:11] THEIR HEART. GOD GOES TO CHURCH. HE
[1:33:14] LOVES TO WORSHIP.
[1:33:18] OH, COME ON, SOMEBODY. IF WE GET SO
[1:33:20] EXCITED ABOUT GOING ON A VACATION
[1:33:22] SOMEWHERE, WE GET EXCITED ABOUT GOING ON
[1:33:24] A GOLF TOUR OR GOING TO DOLLYWOOD, WHAT
[1:33:27] ABOUT COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD WHERE
[1:33:30] THE MIRACULOUS IS HERE, HEALING IS HERE,
[1:33:33] DELIVERANCE IS HERE. OH, WHAT IT COULD
[1:33:36] BE? GOD. [screaming]
[1:33:39] [applause]
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; SORRY, I'm gonna have to get rid of this
[1:33:51] thing.
[1:33:56] [sighs]
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; What visions are
[1:34:00] we? We feel that every person
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; rot shaggy
[1:34:11] IS DUTY [screaming] BOUND.
[1:34:17] to attend some church and belong to some
[1:34:20] church as a Christian. Many people say,
[1:34:22] "Oh, I stay home and read my Bible. I'm
[1:34:26] just as well off." No. The Bible said we
[1:34:29] shouldn't forsake to assemble ourselves
[1:34:31] together. WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT. THIS IS
[1:34:35] NOT A SUGGESTION. WELL, I THINK I THINK
[1:34:38] I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK. THIS IS
[1:34:40] WHAT THE MESSAGE TEACHES IN THE LAST
[1:34:42] DAY. I'M TALKING ABOUT BEING [screaming]
[1:34:45] LIKE GOD. GOD GOES TO CHURCH. GOD LOVES
[1:34:49] SINGING. GOD LOVES WORSHIP. OH,
[1:34:52] HALLELUJAH. AND IF YOU'RE LIKE
[1:34:53] [screaming] GOD, WHAT WILL YOU LOVE?
[1:34:58] [applause]
[1:35:03] We've got
[1:35:06] to do that. And I want somebody to
[1:35:09] present to me the quote or God's prophet
[1:35:12] said, "WE'VE GOT to play the tapes only.
[1:35:24] I'll wait for the quote,
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; but until you send it to me, I'll keep
[1:35:30] on preaching what he said.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Notice that had a real move of God there
[1:35:40] at the tabernacle that morning, 1959.
[1:35:42] Brother Bam said, "I'm still feasting
[1:35:44] also on that blessing this morning on
[1:35:46] the exceeding abundantly." It's unknown.
[1:35:49] Lord have mercy. IT'S UNKNOWN THE THINGS
[1:35:53] THAT GOD WOULD DO FOR US WHEN we
[1:35:56] assemble ourselves together. Have you
[1:35:58] noticed since we made this consecration
[1:36:00] to God how the things has been going
[1:36:03] here? Now can you imagine the Brandham
[1:36:05] tabernacle may needed a reconsecration
[1:36:08] TO THE LORD. THE CHURCH OF THE PROPHET
[1:36:10] OF GOD NEEDED MORE CONSECRATION. AND
[1:36:13] ONCE THEY DEDICATED THEMSELVES, NOT JUST
[1:36:15] [screaming] HIM BUT THEM, GOD BE TO MOVE
[1:36:18] IN A GREATER WAY INSIDE THEIR CHURCH
[1:36:20] THAN IT DONE BEFORE.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; OH MY. BLESSING AFTER BLESSING, POWER
[1:36:27] AFTER POWER, GLORY AFTER GLORY. IT'S
[1:36:30] JUST BEEN WONDERFUL. and he will
[1:36:32] continue
[1:36:34] to do so.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; If you can't come here, get you a good
[1:36:41] church home somewhere
[1:36:43] where they really
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:36:51] brother Brandon said go to a church
[1:36:52] where they preach.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Help my time, as my grandma used TO SAY.
[1:36:58] HELP MY [screaming] TIME. You mean
[1:37:00] brother Brandon believed IN GOING TO
[1:37:01] CHURCH WHERE THEY PREACHED.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, THEY REALLY PREACHED THE
[1:37:08] GOSPEL AND SO YOU CAN BE FED BY THE
[1:37:10] SPIRIT of God. If y'all will get with me
[1:37:13] right here in a few minutes. Oh my.
[1:37:16] [sighs]
[1:37:17] Now listen to this one. after people got
[1:37:20] saved in Brother Brandham's meetings.
[1:37:25] Promise me
[1:37:28] that you'll find a good gospel church
[1:37:31] somewhere, a church that teaches the
[1:37:32] full gospel, the power of God, his
[1:37:35] resurrection. Join up with them people
[1:37:37] with and make yourself a church home.
[1:37:40] Don't stray around loose on the streets.
[1:37:45] Go get a good church somewhere of your
[1:37:47] choice where the gospel and the power of
[1:37:49] God is made known and the signs, oh
[1:37:52] hallelujah, of eternal life is in there.
[1:37:55] The signs that was in Christ and the
[1:37:59] church said,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; DISCERNMENT OF SPIRIT. EVERY MAN OUGHT
[1:38:03] TO HAVE A CHURCH HOME. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
[1:38:06] A PLACE NOT JUST FLOAT ABOUT FROM PILLAR
[1:38:08] TO POST, BUT HAVE SOMEWHERE THAT YOU GO
[1:38:11] TO CHURCH AND CALL IT YOUR CHURCH. COME
[1:38:16] ON, SOMEBODY. LET'S PRESS PLAY AND OBEY.
[1:38:20] SOMEWHERE YOU PAY YOUR TITHE, SOMEWHERE
[1:38:23] THAT YOU HELP SUPPORT THE CAUSE. TAKE
[1:38:25] YOUR CHOICE. BUT THEN DON'T NEVER
[1:38:27] DYSFELLOWSHIP the other man because he
[1:38:30] don't belong WITH YOUR GROUP.
[1:38:33] GOD GOES TO CHURCH.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SAY, "I CAN STAY AT [screaming]
[1:38:41] home
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; then be just as good a Christian as I
[1:38:46] can at church." You can't.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:54] [cheering]
[1:38:55] [applause]
[1:39:02] The Bible said, "Oh,
[1:39:06] so that was important to Brother
[1:39:08] Brandham."
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Yeah, he was a a
[1:39:11] prophet of God."
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID, "NOT FOR SAKE OF
[1:39:17] ASSEMBLING OURSELVES TOGETHER THAT much
[1:39:18] more as we see the time coming." IF
[1:39:22] YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN,
[1:39:25] you long to go.
[1:39:27] where other Christians are and
[1:39:30] fellowship with OTHER CHRISTIANS. SO YOU
[1:39:33] CANNOT STAY AWAY FROM CHURCH AND LIVE
[1:39:37] THE SAME LIFE.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. YOU CANNOT
[1:39:44] STAY AWAY FROM CHURCH AND LIVE THE SAME
[1:39:47] LIFE. I SEE WHY SATAN WANTS MESSAGE
[1:39:50] FOLKS TO STAY AWAY FROM CHURCH BECAUSE
[1:39:53] HE KNOWS THEY CAN'T BE AS GODLY. THEY
[1:39:56] CANNOT LIVE THE SAME KIND OF LIFE. THEY
[1:39:59] ARE LIVING A SELFISH LIFE. AMEN. BY NOT
[1:40:02] BRINGING THEIR STRENGTHS AND THEIR
[1:40:04] SUPPORT TO THE CAUSE OF GOD. I AIN'T
[1:40:06] TALKING ABOUT YOUR MONEY. I'M TALKING
[1:40:08] ABOUT YOU STANDING BEHIND THE GOSPEL OF
[1:40:11] THE LAST DAY.
[1:40:16] [applause]
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; You cannot stay away from church and
[1:40:21] live THE SAME LIFE. YOU you
[1:40:25] can't do it
[1:40:27] because it's like I I'm hungry, but I'll
[1:40:30] never go to a table.
[1:40:33] I'll never eat. I AIN'T GOING TO do it.
[1:40:35] You've got to go and feed on the word of
[1:40:37] God
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; and
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; fellowship with one another. We need one
[1:40:45] another more now than we ever need each
[1:40:48] other. He said it's now. But when YOU
[1:40:50] GET YOURSELF SINGLED out
[1:40:53] from the rest of them, making yourself a
[1:40:55] little different, YOU DON'T WANT TO
[1:40:57] ASSOCIATE WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE
[1:40:59] THIS AND YOU DON'T WANT TO ASSOCIATE
[1:41:00] WITH THAT.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; You're not the perfect bride.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; You're not the called out bride, but
[1:41:09] you're on dangerous ground.
[1:41:16] Can't you see where this move, friends,
[1:41:19] around this message is leading people?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; It's putting them on dangerous ground,
[1:41:25] not rapturing ground.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; You're on dangerous ground, right? Then
[1:41:31] keeping away from church.
[1:41:35] I EXPECT SOME FOLKS TO GET MAD AT ME.
[1:41:37] HEY, what's new about that, right? And
[1:41:39] they may make one of you may want to
[1:41:40] make a few YouTube videos about me and
[1:41:42] call my name and whatever or I don't
[1:41:44] really care.
[1:41:46] But I'll say to you
[1:41:49] and those of you who promote such, how
[1:41:52] is it going to be when you stand before
[1:41:53] God's prophet
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; and him say to you, why did you not say
[1:41:59] what else I said?
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; WHY DID YOU DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM GOING
[1:42:04] TO CHURCH? WHY DID YOU DISCOURAGE
[1:42:06] PEOPLE? LORD HAVE MERCY. WHAT A THING TO
[1:42:08] DO TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM GOING TO
[1:42:11] CHURCH. THAT'S WHAT THE DEVIL
[1:42:12] [screaming] DOES.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; THEN THAT PUTS YOU ON THE DEVIL'S side
[1:42:23] [sighs]
[1:42:25] years and years ago. I was preaching a
[1:42:27] camp down in Texas.
[1:42:31] I preached some things they didn't want
[1:42:32] me to preach.
[1:42:35] was about the Godhead and how great
[1:42:36] Jesus was. And I told him if there's
[1:42:40] another God in heaven, he's sitting on
[1:42:42] the floor. Cuz John looked in heaven, he
[1:42:44] saw only one throne and Jesus was on it.
[1:42:49] Ain't no three or four thrones ever with
[1:42:50] the Godhead sitting on top of it. Oh my.
[1:42:53] Preachers gathered in the back of the
[1:42:54] building, bigger building than this,
[1:42:56] gathered in the back of I seen them. I
[1:42:58] thought, "Oh boy, you've had her now."
[1:42:59] Sure enough, here they come to me after
[1:43:01] church said, "Hey, you can't preach that
[1:43:02] here." THE WHAT WHAT SHOCKED ME WAS
[1:43:04] THERE SUPPOSED TO BE PEOPLE. WONDNESS
[1:43:07] PEOPLE THAT SAID THEY BELIEVED IN THE
[1:43:08] GODHEAD. THEY RUN ME OUT OF THAT CAMP.
[1:43:10] THE SAD PART ABOUT IT WAS THE YOUTH OUT
[1:43:13] THERE WAVING GOODBYE AND CRYING LIKE
[1:43:15] BABIES. Oh my. And yeah MY BUT I'M SO
[1:43:18] GLAD FRIENDS THAT WHEN WE GET RUN
[1:43:20] [screaming] OUT THAT JESUS IS RIGHT
[1:43:23] THERE TO HELP US. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'D GO
[1:43:24] BACK BUT THEY NEVER WOULD LET ME COME
[1:43:26] BACK. BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING. AND IF
[1:43:28] YOU'RE IN THIS SPOT TODAY AND YOU SAY,
[1:43:29] "LORD, I'VE NOT HAD THE RIGHT ATTITUDE,
[1:43:31] BUT I'M INVITING YOU BACK, JESUS. I'M
[1:43:34] INVITING YOU BACK, JESUS. I'M SORRY."
[1:43:36] COME ON, SOMEBODY. WHY DIDN'T I QUIT
[1:43:38] GOING TO CHURCH? BECAUSE I WAS ORDAINED
[1:43:41] TO GO TO CHURCH. I WAS ORDAINED TO
[1:43:43] PREACH. I WAS ORDAINED TO NOT COME TO
[1:43:46] CHURCH AND SIT THERE LIKE A BUMP ON A
[1:43:47] PICKLE. I'M ORDAINED TO CLAP MY HANDS.
[1:43:50] I'M ORDAINED TO PRAISE GOD. I'M ORDAINED
[1:43:53] TO WORSHIP HIM. THAT'S WHAT I WAS BORN
[1:43:56] FOR. I WAS ORDAINED TO [screaming]
[1:43:58] TORMENT HELL. I WAS ORDAINED TO CAST OUT
[1:44:02] DEVILS.
[1:44:05] What about you? [applause]
[1:44:11] [sighs]
[1:44:14] [gasps]
[1:44:15] Some of the deacon brothers might want
[1:44:16] to meet with sister Carol after church
[1:44:18] and she's see if she's putting gunpowder
[1:44:20] in my Sunday morning breakfast.
[1:44:28] You're getting on dangerous ground right
[1:44:30] then, keeping away
[1:44:32] from church.
[1:44:34] Find the one of your choice and remain
[1:44:36] there and be a Christian. Brother, to
[1:44:38] all of them, that's the way to be a real
[1:44:41] Christian.
[1:44:45] So what does that make people who
[1:44:48] actually teach against this?
[1:44:55] Then we've got fellowship.
[1:44:58] I love this other word, protection.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; People love you
[1:45:06] and pray for you.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Can I have you a few more minutes?
[1:45:13] The Holy Spirit in you will not hunger
[1:45:16] for the world. It'll hunger for God.
[1:45:20] If it's hard
[1:45:23] for you to go to church and press
[1:45:26] yourself to come and the church is open,
[1:45:29] there's something wrong with that
[1:45:30] spirit.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Wow. This is the issue, friends.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; This is the problem.
[1:45:42] So, if it's hard for you to go to church
[1:45:44] and press yourself to come when the
[1:45:47] church is open, there's something wrong
[1:45:48] with that spirit. It's notice it it's
[1:45:52] trying to keep you away from God. The
[1:45:57] spirit OF GOD
[1:46:00] WILL RUN YOU
[1:46:03] right straight to the church every time
[1:46:06] the door opens for fellowship.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Well, tell me what kind of spirit is on
[1:46:14] people that runs them away from church
[1:46:16] and they look for every excuse. I got a
[1:46:18] backachche. I got a headache. I got a
[1:46:21] toeache. But it's amazing TO ME THE
[1:46:23] MIRACULOUS happens as soon as church IS
[1:46:25] OVER AND YOU RUN INTO THEM AT WALMART ON
[1:46:28] Sunday evening.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; What cures take place when the amen is
[1:46:43] said and people say, "Honey, I feel
[1:46:46] better.
[1:46:48] Let's go to Red Lobster. Glory to God.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Can people be sick and can't come to
[1:46:57] church? Sure.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; But do those same same people that are
[1:47:02] so sick they can't go here, do they not
[1:47:03] go to Walmart? Do they not go to Target?
[1:47:05] Do they not go to TJ Maxx and go here
[1:47:08] and there and there?
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Uhoh. Uhoh. Preach, Brother Donnie.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Let me close.
[1:47:22] Our heavenly father,
[1:47:25] thou has chosen
[1:47:27] that we should gather together.
[1:47:32] It's the will
[1:47:34] of God.
[1:47:39] I don't care what revelation you have or
[1:47:41] what man is teaching you otherwise.
[1:47:45] If they don't say what the law and the
[1:47:46] prophet said, they are liars.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; It's the will of God that we should
[1:47:58] assemble ourselves together as we see
[1:48:01] the day approaching and that regularly,
[1:48:06] Lord, to bring ourselves closer to you
[1:48:09] and closer to each other in the bond of
[1:48:12] fellowship.
[1:48:15] through the shed blood of Jesus,
[1:48:18] which makes it possible.
[1:48:22] You see, so you're not just coming for
[1:48:24] yourself,
[1:48:25] but you're coming for others.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Again, he says, "And be not afraid, it
[1:48:31] is I." We're taught that as the day
[1:48:33] begins to approach to the end, that we
[1:48:35] should not forsake the assembling of
[1:48:37] ourselves together
[1:48:39] as some who [snorts] have not the faith.
[1:48:46] Wow.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Now, what I don't understand is I I I
[1:48:51] guess I guess probably I must have got
[1:48:55] the infabase that had all these going to
[1:48:58] church quotes in it.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; And then a lot of other people, they got
[1:49:02] a different infabase. Maybe that word,
[1:49:05] you know, whenever they type in these
[1:49:07] exact words that I typed in yesterday,
[1:49:10] gather ourselves together, quotation
[1:49:13] marks and here it just pulls right up
[1:49:16] right there in the message.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Wow. And these are not AI generated.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Although it wouldn't surprise me in the
[1:49:26] near future if we don't get some that
[1:49:28] are generated that says we shouldn't go.
[1:49:32] Come on.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; But remember, anything we make the
[1:49:39] prophet of God say that's contrary to
[1:49:41] scripture is false doctrine. And we make
[1:49:44] him a liar.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. Word of life. God's prophet
[1:49:49] never come to lead us away from the
[1:49:51] Bible, but lead us right back to the
[1:49:53] Bible.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's stand together.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Is your life worthy of the gospel?
[1:50:13] We have assembled together, Father, for
[1:50:14] no other purpose but to try to learn how
[1:50:16] to live better and to live closer to
[1:50:19] you. For we see the day approaching,
[1:50:22] and we
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; must assemble ourselves together.
[1:50:29] oft
[1:50:32] and take instructions
[1:50:34] from you.
[1:50:37] Grant it, Father, in Jesus name.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Donnie, every time I come
[1:50:43] into church, I don't always get
[1:50:44] something. Jesus could relate to that.
[1:50:48] And the Lord God said to so and so, and
[1:50:50] so and so begat so and so and so be go
[1:50:52] begat so and so. Some of y'all go to
[1:50:53] sleep on me and I preach like a
[1:50:54] firecracker lit on both ends. I can't
[1:50:56] imagine if you had been in the
[1:50:57] synagogue, you just stretched out
[1:51:00] [laughter]
[1:51:02] so and so begat so and so and he begat
[1:51:04] so and so and they begat so and so and
[1:51:05] they went this many perimeters this way
[1:51:06] and done that and they done that and
[1:51:08] what do you say? Glory to God. What do
[1:51:10] you say?
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; I love this one. Christ's a mystery.
[1:51:18] Now you've got tapes
[1:51:20] on that.
[1:51:23] You've got tapes on what we believe
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; and you've got tapes on discipline
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; in the church.
[1:51:36] I wonder why they ain't hearing them.
[1:51:40] Wonder why some of you ain't hearing
[1:51:41] them.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; You come once every two or three weeks,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; way out of church, stay home your sorry
[1:51:48] hide on Wednesday night when you could
[1:51:49] come to church.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Preach it now.
[1:51:54] Streaming ain't meant to discourage
[1:51:56] people from going to church.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; It's to help the envalid, the
[1:51:59] those that wants to stream where else.
[1:52:01] Oh, but brother Donnie, I've got a
[1:52:02] slight little pain. Does that stop you
[1:52:03] from going on your sister's trip?
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; I've got a slight little headache. Oh,
[1:52:08] does that stop you from going on a
[1:52:10] hunting trip or a golfing tour, some of
[1:52:12] you brothers, or do you take a little
[1:52:14] Tylenol in Jesus name and go ahead and
[1:52:16] pack YOUR BAGS?
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; WOO! IF YOU GO ON A GOLFING TOUR WITH A
[1:52:21] HEADACHE, that shouldn't hinder you from
[1:52:22] coming to the house of God. And if YOU
[1:52:25] AIN'T GOT TYLENOL, LET ME KNOW. I'LL BUY
[1:52:27] YOU SOME. [applause]
[1:52:33] Lord have mercy.
[1:52:35] You going to get me killed one of these
[1:52:36] days.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; You've got tapes on discipline in the
[1:52:41] church. HOW WE BEHAVE OURSELF IN THE
[1:52:44] CHURCH of God.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:49] how we got to come together. So, we got
[1:52:51] tapes on that of how we got to come
[1:52:55] together and set TOGETHER IN HEAVENLY
[1:52:57] PLACES. DON'T STAY HOME.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; NOW, here's this massive gigantic
[1:53:08] twolettered
[1:53:10] word
[1:53:12] if.
[1:53:15] If God
[1:53:17] is in your heart,
[1:53:20] you can't hardly wait
[1:53:25] for them doors to open up yonder, to get
[1:53:28] in here to fellowship with your
[1:53:30] brothers,
[1:53:32] which is going to be pretty hard for you
[1:53:34] to do if you don't believe in going to
[1:53:36] church
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; because they're in their home and you're
[1:53:38] in your home and you're in your home and
[1:53:40] you're all streaming from one location.
[1:53:41] That's kind of tough. Y'all do remember
[1:53:43] the COVID days, right?
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; I didn't JUST MISS COMING TO CHURCH. I
[1:53:48] missed you all.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Y'all might not have missed me, but I
[1:53:51] missed you. And I'm We miss one another,
[1:53:53] right?
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE GOT THAT
[1:53:56] LONGLASTED COVID EFFECTS. They still
[1:53:59] don't want to get together, but I
[1:54:01] believe Jesus is here to deliver the
[1:54:03] postcoavid effects where you SAY, "OH
[1:54:05] LORD, I NEED TO GO TO CHURCH. I NEED TO
[1:54:07] BE WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTER. I NEED
[1:54:10] TO WORSHIP. I NEED TO BE THERE AS A
[1:54:12] STRENGTH.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you friends,
[1:54:18] this this puzzles me to no end.
[1:54:21] How people nearly make him God
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; and say it's God talking on tapes and
[1:54:28] it's the literal VOICE OF GOD AND GOD
[1:54:30] HIMSELF. How can you say that
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; and then read a statement like this?
[1:54:40] Don't stay home. If God is in your
[1:54:42] heart, you can't hardly wait for them
[1:54:43] doors to open yonder and to get into
[1:54:46] fellowship with your brothers. And if
[1:54:48] you don't feel that way, then I tell
[1:54:50] you,
[1:54:52] it's time
[1:54:54] you got to praying
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; cuz we're in the last days. And the
[1:55:04] Bible exhorted us to much more
[1:55:08] as we see the day approaching to love
[1:55:10] one another with Christian love and
[1:55:12] divine love to assemble ourselves
[1:55:14] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:55:16] Jesus and love one another. This will
[1:55:18] all men know that you are my disciples
[1:55:21] when you have love one for another.
[1:55:23] That's right. Stay right together.
[1:55:29] Token and shreport.
[1:55:31] We should love one another more than we
[1:55:33] ever did in all of our lives.
[1:55:37] There should be such a hunger to get to
[1:55:40] church.
[1:55:43] There should be such a hunger for us
[1:55:46] to get to one another.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; It should be a love affair.
[1:55:54] Who is Jesus and Topicus? We should
[1:55:56] assemble ourselves together. The Bible
[1:55:58] tells us that as we see the end
[1:56:00] approaching, not forsaking this of
[1:56:02] ourselves together, it'll it'll not only
[1:56:05] do that, it'll strengthen you
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; and you your strength
[1:56:12] will strengthen
[1:56:15] the church.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Can't you see what a selfish life that
[1:56:19] people live
[1:56:22] that see no need in attending a place of
[1:56:25] worship?
[1:56:28] They are robbers
[1:56:30] and they're being robbed.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; They're being robbed of our strength and
[1:56:36] they're robbing us
[1:56:38] of their strength.
[1:56:41] How can robbers go to heaven?
[1:56:49] I sure love y'all.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Wish I had time. Go out and eat with all
[1:56:52] of you after church. I know everyone
[1:56:54] want to buy my dinner.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:11] Let's bow our heads together.
[1:57:17] [sighs]
[1:57:20] Dear Jesus,
[1:57:23] what a serious hour, Lord.
[1:57:28] When Paul wrote it so many years ago in
[1:57:30] the time when the Christians were being
[1:57:33] killed and
[1:57:35] to be caught going to church could cost
[1:57:37] them their life,
[1:57:40] maybe their wife, their children, unborn
[1:57:43] babies.
[1:57:46] So they started kind of pulling back
[1:57:48] from church a little bit.
[1:57:51] And Paul felt led to write to them and
[1:57:53] tell them,
[1:57:55] "I know it's hard times and I know it's
[1:57:57] scary and it's fearful, but forsake not
[1:58:00] the assembling of yourselves together."
[1:58:03] I'm so glad that he took that
[1:58:05] opportunity because it's not said like
[1:58:07] that anywhere else in the entire New
[1:58:09] Testament.
[1:58:12] And what a
[1:58:14] background for it to be written under.
[1:58:17] people that were losing their life
[1:58:19] because they were identified as being
[1:58:20] Christians. And we know that public
[1:58:22] worship has always been something that
[1:58:24] you have wanted from the very garden of
[1:58:27] Eden. Abraham under his oak at memory.
[1:58:32] Jacob at man.
[1:58:35] There's something about public worship.
[1:58:38] You've never wanted your church to be in
[1:58:41] secret. Lord,
[1:58:44] it just breaks my heart, Father.
[1:58:48] As we see the days approaching and
[1:58:49] around the world in the ranks of the
[1:58:51] message, this move,
[1:58:54] it's dividing folks that have been
[1:58:56] friends for years,
[1:58:58] people leaving churches,
[1:59:02] just staying home.
[1:59:04] How sad. And the sad part about it is,
[1:59:07] Father, they try to use the very message
[1:59:10] that all these quotes I read from today
[1:59:13] come from that very message. and they
[1:59:16] try to use that very same message to
[1:59:18] prove we don't need church.
[1:59:23] Lord Jesus, thank you for your truth.
[1:59:27] Lord, I may not turn one person today.
[1:59:30] There'll probably some listen. They'll
[1:59:31] get mad and angry and all upset and
[1:59:33] whatever more. But father, even if one
[1:59:36] person that believes this false doctrine
[1:59:38] is never turned, I hope that the people
[1:59:42] here who believe in going to church will
[1:59:45] be more fired up about going than
[1:59:47] they've ever been in their entire life.
[1:59:49] I hope they have a greater desire and a
[1:59:51] greater determination
[1:59:54] to realize Lord Jesus this place where
[1:59:57] we are.
[2:00:00] Oh dear God, dedicated to your presence,
[2:00:04] dedicated as a place of worship
[2:00:07] and you've met with us so many times
[2:00:09] already, Lord, no longer than we've been
[2:00:11] here. Already the angels of God have
[2:00:14] been seen visibly in this place.
[2:00:18] Lord, I'll never forget it. Several
[2:00:20] years ago before we left Happy Valley
[2:00:23] after I'd preached one night and at the
[2:00:25] end of the service, I looked over to
[2:00:27] Harry to tell him what song
[2:00:30] to sing.
[2:00:33] And standing over by my office door
[2:00:36] said an angel,
[2:00:39] a man standing there, dark hair,
[2:00:44] white garments,
[2:00:46] looking straight at me.
[2:00:48] I felt totally paralyzed.
[2:00:53] I turned my head away because I was
[2:00:55] feeling so overcome by that presence. I
[2:00:58] couldn't hardly take it.
[2:01:01] And then I turned back and he was gone.
[2:01:06] That's the kind of church we want.
[2:01:09] That's the kind of place we want. It
[2:01:11] don't have to be fancy.
[2:01:13] Lord, if it was a storefront building
[2:01:15] and had plastered walls that had been
[2:01:17] repaired over and over again, but it was
[2:01:20] dedicated to you.
[2:01:22] It would be a special place.
[2:01:26] How many have we baptized once we've
[2:01:27] come here, Lord? How many have renewed
[2:01:29] their life to you, Lord? Oh, how many
[2:01:31] things you've done among us,
[2:01:34] and we're so thankful.
[2:01:36] Father, I pray that we will never lose
[2:01:39] the sacredness.
[2:01:42] I used to hate the years I was in
[2:01:44] Pentecost, Lord. I thought it was such a
[2:01:47] waste of my time. But as I look back, I
[2:01:50] realized there was some things that I
[2:01:52] gained back there that were true. And
[2:01:56] going to church and it being sacred and
[2:02:00] it being holy and a consecrated place.
[2:02:04] I'm so glad that I realized that years
[2:02:06] and years ago.
[2:02:09] And I'm so thankful, Father,
[2:02:12] that we know, Lord God, it's still the
[2:02:14] same today.
[2:02:16] Would you pass through us here this
[2:02:18] morning, Lord,
[2:02:20] the sick, the weary, may the angels of
[2:02:24] God that are standing at their post of
[2:02:27] duty.
[2:02:28] Hallelujah.
[2:02:31] May they minister strength,
[2:02:34] encouragement.
[2:02:37] We love you today, Jesus.
[2:02:40] We want to rededicate our lives to you,
[2:02:42] Father, in this place today.
[2:02:46] Oh Lord, take us,
[2:02:48] use us, Father.
[2:02:51] Take my hands, my mouth,
[2:02:54] Lord Jesus. My spirit, my soul, my body.
[2:02:59] I rededicate it. I reconsecrate it to
[2:03:02] you today. Lord,
[2:03:04] I pray for my musician
[2:03:07] brothers and sisters that play and the
[2:03:09] song leaders. I pray for the leoty. I
[2:03:12] pray for the brothers and the sound
[2:03:14] booths, the recording, the audio, the
[2:03:16] internet, all of that. Help us, Lord. I
[2:03:19] pray for the deacons, the trustees.
[2:03:22] Oh Jesus, may we rededicate ourselves to
[2:03:26] you today, Father.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; We ask for more sincerity.
[2:03:32] We ask that we can be more God
[2:03:36] conscious.
[2:03:38] Help us, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:41] Help every minister in our church that
[2:03:45] climbs behind this pullpit
[2:03:48] to realize that they're standing at the
[2:03:51] closest place
[2:03:54] between heaven
[2:03:56] and earth.
[2:03:59] So therefore, we're not interested in
[2:04:01] their ideas or their agendas or them.
[2:04:06] But men of God preach Jesus.
[2:04:10] Help me Lord as the pastor.
[2:04:13] Oh Lord God, to stay true, stay
[2:04:17] faithful.
[2:04:19] I believe
[2:04:22] your greatness will be made manifest
[2:04:23] among us in a way
[2:04:26] that we've not yet seen
[2:04:29] if we can just dedicate ourselves to
[2:04:31] you, Father.
[2:04:35] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:39] How many just rededicate your life here
[2:04:41] this morning while we're standing in the
[2:04:42] presence of the Lord?
[2:04:45] Would you mind laying a hand on that
[2:04:46] person there standing by you?
[2:04:49] You're offering yourself now, but you're
[2:04:52] praying for them that God will help
[2:04:54] them.
[2:04:57] Oh, Wednesday night when you walk in
[2:04:59] this place next Sunday, when you walk in
[2:05:01] here,
[2:05:02] may this sermon be a pivotal point in
[2:05:04] our lives
[2:05:06] till we realize this is a sacred place.
[2:05:10] This is a holy place.
[2:05:14] God goes to church
[2:05:17] and God loves to worship.
[2:05:21] Hallelujah.
[2:05:24] Hallelujah.
[2:05:28] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:05:31] Brother John, would you come pray for
[2:05:33] the people?
[2:05:36] Lord Jesus,
[2:05:40] thank you, Father.
[2:05:55] Father,
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; oh heavenly father, [snorts]
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; how we love you, Lord Jesus. How we
[2:06:01] thank you so much for your word, Lord.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord God.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father God,
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; help us, Father. It helps us realize,
[2:06:08] Father, where we're sitting at. Lord,
[2:06:11] maybe we don't sit on the side where we
[2:06:13] don't want to go to church, Lord. Lord
[2:06:15] Jesus,
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; but Father, maybe it helps us to realize
[2:06:18] that there's so many of our our loved
[2:06:20] ones that do, Father.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus, I pray.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I pray that you would just
[2:06:25] move, Lord.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; I pray, Lord Jesus, that you would just
[2:06:29] help us, each and every one, Lord Jesus,
[2:06:31] that we might rededicate our lives to
[2:06:34] you, Lord. We pray, Father God, that we
[2:06:37] we would be more fervent and more
[2:06:39] sincere, Lord Jesus, in you, Lord. May
[2:06:42] we realize, Lord, that as the world gets
[2:06:45] wicer and evil, Lord Jesus, that you are
[2:06:48] becoming greater and more holy, Lord
[2:06:51] Jesus, and you're desiring for us to get
[2:06:54] closer to you, Father. How we love you,
[2:06:56] Lord. We thank you, Father, that you
[2:06:58] make us aware, Father, that that you
[2:07:00] want us, Lord Jesus, to be more sincere,
[2:07:03] Lord Jesus. And and and make us more
[2:07:06] aware, Father God, of what you want to
[2:07:08] do for us, Lord Jesus. We know that the
[2:07:11] word is coming down so strong, so pure,
[2:07:14] Lord Jesus, that you're grabbing our
