========================================

now the people are shouting and rejoicing and screaming and here comes the Ark of God and the Bible said that the oxen stumbled so they just stumbled and when they did the cart simply just tilted like that and this man sincere man loved God with all of his heart remember his name oza and when ever he saw it what did he do put forth his hands to steady the ark oh he's trying to help God and whenever he touched it God killed him right there and the Bible said David went to his house that day afraid of the Lord now would people in our day how would they look at that well they should look at it pretty importantly because they're doing the exact same thing people in the message are too they leave this out and leave that out and leave that so oh it don't really matter don't really matter I mean what difference with it's Levites or whatever I mean we're bringing the word back praise God we're bringing the word back that's why you hear me preaching the tape only say and Blasting it all the time because what are they trying to do they're trying to leave out the order and the protocol of God God's Prophet show me where he ever laid hands on a tap place and ordained a tape player to be your pastor well praise the Lord a tap player can play brother brandom's tapes we thank God for it but you can go in this office back here and tell the tape player you've got problems and see if it answers you see if it can lay its hands on you you show me a tape player with hands I want that tape player but go what do they do they well would just take what the prophet said no they're not taking what the prophet said they're taking part of what the prophet said and they're setting the word the message of the hour over on a new cart what is that cart called tapes only and then they make their t-shirts and their sweatshirts and their hoodies and all that tape boy tape girl they got all this sort of say and we're proud to be taped we're proud to be taped well I said we really listen to those tapes and hear what they'd say then they'd find a church where they believe in preaching and they'd have men of God that are there but what they do they leave it out then we've got some that believe in preaching and they choose to leave this out and choose to leave that out I'll tell you one thing I don't want to leave nothing out myself no matter how small how insignificant that it might appear y'all understand where I'm coming from now watch he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with with Harps and according to the Commandment of David and of GAD to the king sear so now watch's David how this is now under the administration of Solomon and what they've done no doubt David we reiterated over and over and over again to Solomon his horrible mistake of not following the word of God so David had a Seer one which could see but David instead of Consulting the sear what how should we bring the word back David just went right around him and said I think this is good but watch him now whenever it comes to dedicating the house of God passing this on to Solomon they had the Levites symbols sues Harps according to the Commandment of David of GAD the king sa and naan the prophet oh my goodness boy they want to be sure they're worshiping right now don't they so they've got Gad The Seer and nathon the prophet praise the Lord you know what that done that scared David it scared him you want to know why I want to follow this word so much cuz I have a fear in my heart when I study this message I don't look at it as just some other study manual I don't look at it the same way that I would look at a Bible encyclopedia I don't look at it in the same way that I would pick up Adam Clark's commentary or you know some of these other biblical illustrator commentary I look at it totally different it's a prophet's message a prophet's message I hope I always look at it that way yes sir notice again in 2 Chronicles 36:16 but they mocked The Messengers of God and despised his words and misused His prophets until the Wrath of the Lord rose against his people till there was no remedy oh my goodness young people don't never leave this word don't never leave this word oh you may always have questions my goodness I've said this message for years and years and years sometimes I think I have more questions than I have answers but I'm so glad for What Little bet I do understand oh Hallelujah now look at what God did so they mocked The Messengers of God they despised his words they misused His prophets until the wraths of the Lord arose against his people not Philistines not amorites not Hittites not jebusites gites but because his people treated His prophets this way the wrath of God raised against God's Own people my to till there was no remedy hide is the Lord Jesus behind this word Jeremiah 7: 25 since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt until this day I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up early and sending them now notice how many times that prophets is mentioned here in the Old Testament verse 26 yet they hearken not to me nor incline their ear but hardened their neck and they did worse than their fathers now I want you to notice that God he reckons himself as being the message that the prophets brought so he says I sent my servants to prophets daily rising up early and sending them yet they hearken not unto me now watch God is taking this as if though he himself was the ones that was speaking to Israel isn't that amazing that God would choose a man with a gift and it would be God breaking that man into the realm of vision and he would say thus sayeth the Lord and them people that are supposed to be the people of God would say we don't want what you've got to say now you do understand of course why they did that because Satan saw the importance of prophets too so when God would have a Jeremiah God God anointed God's mouthpiece Satan raised up a zedekiah Jeremiah zedekiah at the same time frame and zedek now whenever he would come in there he would not come in and say abraa Deborah abraa this and some type of chant and some type of blood of a goat but you know what zedi would do he would come in thus sayith the Lord so here you are now we'll say you're Israel so Jeremiah is saying you better repent you better get right you better give your heart to God God's going to sell you out to Nebuchadnezzar and then here comes another prophet he say thus sayeth the Lord Jeremiah's a false prophet you ain't going to be down there no 70 years you'll only be down there two years and you'll come back thus sayeth the Lord so who are you going to believe what if you're carnal you're going to choose the easier way you're going to take the two-year propit prophecy cuz that's the way our flesh is it always looks for the easy way how close can I walk to heaven but not I don't want to be a fanatic now I don't want to go my goodness why should I go way up here why should I go way up here just show me brother Donnie how close I can walk to the world and be saved but I won't be lost but show me how close I can get if you're having to do this you're way too close to the world I want to be way up yonder don't you father in I am away from the cliff the more safe I feel but can you imagine that every time God would raise up one Satan would do the same thing now watch in Hosea chapter 6:4 oh Ephraim what shall I do unto thee Oh Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early due it goeth away now therefore watch what God Said therefore have I HED them by the prophets so you understand Church natural foolish virgin all these churches out here they refuse the the tool by which God chops out his people so God Hues his people by prophets so he sends a prophet with a message and he chops the people out of the denomination well you know you look at them and they're pretty rough because they were chopped out with a pretty sharp tool in a prophet's hand and it got a little bit rough sometimes so God sends the rest of the ministry pastors evangelist teachers missionaries what do they do the same Holy Ghost not new word now same Holy Ghost they go to honing and polishing and honing taking them edges and rounding them all say they want a three4 round and it comes out of their great you know straighten oh my it's got splinters all over it you rub your hand down through there like I did today building something for Carol and I put it put one coat of finish on it and whenever I did the plywood had absorbed all the finish and I rubbed my hand up and when I did eight or 10 splinters right in my fingers and the palm of my hand I nearly cried like a girl but you see that was part of the process so I took a sand sing block dipped it in water and I wet sanded it and by doing that the Finish will cause them little splinters to stand up and it makes them hard then you can take a piece of sandpaper and rub over the top of it and they totally disappear and then I made it ready so I kept working it higher and higher another finish another higher coat of sandpaper from 320 up to 500 then up to a th000 then up to a 1,200 and a while ago before I come i s that it was the final one 5,000 grit it's so fine it feels almost like a piece of paper so God chops his people out but chopped out people ain't ready for a Rapture so what' God do God calls pastors he calls evangelist he calls teachers it calls missionaries and then they go to working boy they go to sanding and they'll rub across your hide and boy some of you I rub across it I go don't worry I ain't going to give up on you aren't you glad God don't give up on us but you see what God did God said I have heed them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth you understand that's what's happened to us that we have died oh I've been playing a song that I that I heard here several weeks ago and it's it's talking about giving up everything you know to the world and all that so that you can get everything back that you really learn how to get it back once you give it all up and the words of the song say I died as a pulper and was reborn a king praise God I died as a sinner poper and I was reborn a king and God will work on us and Slick us down and get us Slicker and Slicker all the time that finished product and that's what people can't take they don't want they don't want their Splinter sand it down they don't want all the rough edges all they just leave me alone just just leave me like I am leave me tell me how good I am tell me how sweet I am tell me how I'm going to heaven tell me how I understand God understands all my failures no I want to sing s you I want to send you oh I going to run over you hide and run over you hide and mine right there with you until we get a slick that a fly comes in like a 747 he lands on one side and slides pum out on the other and breaks his neck on the other side and say now that's some slick Christians Hallelujah we want to be so honed in the presence of God that we will have a resistance in our life to sin Darkness Hallelujah until one day the spirit of God will so saturate our beings that death itself will fall off of our bodies and in a moment in a weing of an eye our hair color is going to be changed our age will be changed we'll all become the same age in a moment of time what a miracle and the same message that brought that to us will also usher in the tribulation period right and the atomic bombs will start flying I'm sure you've heard just this week with President Biden doing what he's done to Ukraine and allowing our missiles called attacks are the names that they go by allowing Ukraine to start singing them further into Russia Russia has responded yesterday and some today with icbms and now Russia Putin has signed a document that has lowered the threshold of his nuclear Doctrine what the call nuclear Doctrine well we got some nuclear Doctrine too it's nuclear to the soul praise God I ain't worried about the bombs are you no I I'm more concerned about the truth of this hour because I don't believe we're ever going to see it noow we we are going to take this Rapture by the word of God oh Hallelujah Hosea 12:10 I have also spoken by oh my goodness I have have spoken by the prophets so let's look at it like this what if this message is sent from God people laugh ridicule make fun of criticize now let's look at it in this sense if this message is not sent from God what have you give up that has been so bad for you look I mean some of the Aries live just like we do that's some right here today Amish people and Hut out different ones that was going to help build some buildings in the Reconstruction over here in the flood and I talk to one of them one of them that's that owns a construction company nice people the woman looked just like any of you sisters except she had the thing up here on top of her head she had long hair she had a long skirt dressed decent all that the man himself very nice courteous no bad language nothing like that really nice people so just looking Holiness some of the apostolic people still do that but that within itself will not make us ready for a Rapture but God has things to say that are more than Holiness so or you say well we've had to give up we we can't wear pants at our church the alies don't either hudats don't you know many the people there's still some of them left around the world you know being being being a missionar as I have over the seas over the world and you go into different parts of Africa it's very unusual Kenya Tanzania Zimbabwe some of those African countries very unusual to see a woman with pants on thousands times thousands times thousands of them still wear dresses it's just their attire it's just what they do here in America of course we're totally different so it's not just the clothes so we live clean so we live thing we think on things like that praise God you know people say well I give up the message and what does that mean exactly when people say well I walked away from the message so what does the message preach the message preaches this is some of our Doctrine I've got it written down sometime I hope the Lord let lets me bring it to you but this is what the message teaches that we are lost without the blood of the Lord Jesus so when people say they leave the message are they leaving that we believe Jesus died for our sins is that right we believe we are born lost right that's what the message teaches so when people leave the message do they leave that we believe in justification for we are Justified is that right according to the word of God so when people leave the message do they leave that we believe in sanctification do we not so when people leave the message they leave that we believe in predestination for whom he did for no he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren so do they leave predestination we believe in election the message teaches that the message teaches us for knowledge so when people say they leave the message what exactly does that mean that means they're leaving all these scriptures but let me tell you what most of them mean they're not going to set under a prophet messenger they don't want his name called they don't want his picture in their house they don't want this and that and the other it's not so much the scriptures it's not so much that it's being identified with God's Prophet well you imagine if you had lived in the days of Paul and Timothy got up to preach a sermon and Timothy would have had his notes there maybe he' used a few Old Testament scriptures and he's saying now brothers and sisters I just got this letter the other day and it was written by our beloved brother Paul and it was written to the church at thessalonica but I noticed here in reading this that brother Paul said he told the church that thessalonica to read the epistle which was written to the leans and let the leans read the one that was written to them so there they're stand and say a visor come in service at night and come in and sat down they said oh Lord have mercy a that Paul guy wasn't he the one that they I mean this guy was a wouldn't was this guy in prison no doubt he's guilty no doubt they Lord they ain't no telling what in the world he is in boy if there's smoke there's fire somewhere oh there ain't no way he could have been no prophet of God been thrown in jail in and out of jail stood before Nero himself why my goodness and yet that man stood up there and read from him oh I can't believe it if You' have lived in the first century that's what they would have done and you know what here we live in the last century in the last age of of time and we're doing the same thing because we believe the alpha has become the Omega and the Omega is going to reach a place of such maturity that we will call the alpha out of the Grave Hallelujah I'm feeling a little bit religious right now I have also spoken by the prophets I have mult multiplied visions and used similitudes by the minist of the prophets praise God Matthew 223 and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a Nazarene well what difference did that make why would why would Jesus even need the word of the prophets but if you'll study your new testament you'll find the four gospels and also the Pauline Epistles constantly are referring to what the prophets had to say you see our faith is what is called judeo Christian and what that means is that it is based upon the principles of Judaism judeo Christian we are the true original judeo Christian faith because we still believe that God can use prophets praise the Lord now let me read this to you again then I'm going to shock you he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a Nazarene any person under the sound of my voice tonight or anybody that'll hear this I'll give you $1,000 if you will show me where one of the prophets of the Old Testament wrote it down and said he will be called a Nazarene hello testing frequency voided frequency voided they didn't understand me now for those who want to be and say oh brother Bram said things brother well why don't you read your Bible people quote this scripture I oh yeah the prophet said well show me where the Prophet said it hello watch in Matthew 5:17 think not that I am come to destroy the law oh my goodness we're reading this out of the New Testament brother Mala think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill Matthew 7:12 therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you do even so to them for this is the law and the prophets now remember I told you the last time we spoke on this that people who think themselves Bible scholars and they try to quote from John and say well the law and the prophets is under John and then from that time the Kingdom of Heaven is preached and people pressed away into it and they try to use that scripture to say that there are no more prophets it shows how scripturally ignorant they really are this reference is made over and over again in the New Testament in these two segments or categories the law and the prophets is simply identifying the Torah and the prophets Hosea Amos Malachi Zachariah all the prophets the two distinctions of the Old Testaments was called the law and the prophets now what's amazing is that the our Christian faith come out of the foundation of Judaism and brought right into this notice again therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you do you even so to them for this is the law and the prophets Matthew 11:13 for all the prophets and the law prophesied unto John what are we talking about now the law all the prophets and the law basically the Old Testament the Old Testament prophesied unto John Matthew 23:29 woe unto you scribes Pharisees Hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepers of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would have been partakers we would not have been partakers oh my with them in the blood of the prophet oh I'll tell you one thing if IID have lived in the days of Jeremiah I would have never allowed them to put rotted claws under his armpits and allow them to put a rope around the upper torso of his body and put him in a rope across a pulley and put him down into a pit that was kneed deep in mud and allow that prophet of God I would have never stood by and allowed them to put Isaiah's body in a hollow law and take a Crosscut saw and cut that prophet in two while he's screaming and begging for mercy I'd have never done it and yet they'll get on YouTube and make a little personal video of how I escaped the message cult and the false prophet William brandom no you didn't kill el you didn't kill Elijah the first time he was here but you try to kill his INF fluence now well praise the lord they're doing exactly what the word says they would do wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets oh my so you see we would transport a lot of these people today that are doing and saying what they're doing against the message of the hour they they would have been the ones who would have let Jeremiah Down the Well they would have been the very ones that would have called Jesus be elub they would have been the ones that done terrible horrible things and you would have been the ones who would have followed their message you ought to be pretty happy tonight no matter where God would have put you in any age your seed would have brought out the same thing you'd have responded in the days of Noah brother Bobby you've been helping build the ark in the days of lucer you've been shouting praise God I've been justified by by faith in the days of wesa you'd have been laying on the floor as a Holy Roller you've been shouting under sanctification but God allowed you to live in the body change age under the ministry of Malachi 4 thanks be to God and we are so happy to Bear the reproach of Our Lord are we not let me read one more scripture we'll close wherefore behold I send unto you prophets now I want you to notice who this is the Lord Jesus he is not saying this in the past tense form but future now people want to argue with it let them argue with him wherefore behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them you shall kill and crucify some of them shall you Scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from City to City so from Tucson to Louisville to Johnson City brother Ron told me the other day those articles are actually published in the paper there in uh in Harrisonburg so from City to City to city they're persecuting and when they persecute us they are persecuting the message of the hour by doing that they're persecuting the fruit of God's prophet's Ministry when they persecute that the persecuting the Lord Jesus himself that's why the Lord Jesus could say to Paul Saul Saul why persecutest thou me now it might be hard for you to comprehend but being a preacher and preaching this message I have had death threats on my life several times Brother Gary Hara brother Joe's father and I was talking about it to today in a meeting I preached in Kentucky several years ago and when I pulled up on the parking lot of that meeting where it was at it was acting camp gr where brother brand would preached there in 1955 there was two guys met me with guns on their hips so I thought what in the world Brother Gary was there and I didn't know what was going on brother Charlie Cox had hosted the meeting and some people had called and threatened to kill me for what cuz I somebody else's wife cuz i' stole money no because he preached the word you think You' never believe in this day would we the people would be that far gone look friend the pre-tribulation period anointing it's already here people are not that far from murder right now look at what people are doing that lost the election people are insane just seeing people that's lost the election didn't go the way they wanted it to do they're out of their minds thank God for Grace to keep us now can you imagine these men surrounded me they went they took me to a certain room they stayed outside I told them I want to be by myself and pray they wouldn't let me go to the bathroom by myself they followed me to the bathroom they followed me Under the Tent back and forth every night because somebody threatened to kill me several years ago whenever I preach some things again threats from all over the United States people going to come and boycott and kill you saying why why you know why cuz I was preaching the message of the hour now if I would have went through it and left this out and left that out and not make don't body man you know what boy if I say that right there o that won't go over very good so Lord I'll just kind of conveniently slide that under here and I I believe it with all my heart but I ain't going to preach that and and get me in trouble no that's not the kind of preacher I am if God lays it on my heart I'm going to say it sir and we yes sir I am proud to be identified with the message of the hour let them call us whatever they want to call us and you know what we're going to do back to them we're not going to call them names we're not going to ridicule them we're not going to make fun of them we're going to pray for them and pray that God will help them and be merciful and we hope and pray they've not crossed that line you imagine let me close with this the Lord Jesus said some of them they shall kill and crucify some of them they'll Scourge prophets so if the days of prophets is over apparently the Lord Jesus did not get that note I guess somehow the Post-it note must have fell off of jesus' text that day and Jesus didn't realize the prophets after John was over when he himself said I'm going to send you prophets Matthew 23:37 let's stand together oh jerus Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings and you would not oh I don't know that I'll ever forget it but many years ago I was awakened by the spirit of God before daylight early one morning and I heard these words oh America America how of I would have gathered you and I heard his voice say America the Beautiful America the cursed America the Beautiful America the Damned we ought to be so happy tonight because that's where we would be if it wasn't for the mercy of God don't you love him with all your heart God called us out of that mess let's not go back into it you understand the love of God Malachi 4 says behold I sent unto you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord then he tells us why then he tells us goes on in verse 6 lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse the Advent of Malachi 4:5 delayed The Curse Of God long enough to call out a people in a Rapture and to set in motion the resurrection of the Dead lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse it will take more than building churches it'll take more than having singing conventions only Elijah will keep it off thank god let's bow our heads thank you Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we're so grateful tonight Lord for the prophets those fire brands that you've send down Through the Ages oh God I remember in my earlier days of being a Christian being a preacher how I wondered in darkness I wasn't out drinking running around all that but I just didn't know the truth Lord I I I read my Bible I believed it I memorized great portions of it and when I would preach I would quote scripture but yet I was blind to the meaning of those scriptures until you led me to the message of Malachi 4 and this message did not make me take my Bible and Fold It Up and put it up on the shelf and never open it again but I love my Bible now more than ever before because this word opens up the scriptures and makes it so plain and so marvelous to us then we would sit and look at it and think how could people think we are so weird because all through the Old Testament and the new even Jesus himself said I will send prophets and he told us what the people would do to them and they are carrying it out but Lord Jesus we also know there's a people that will respond to the truth of those prophets and we're happy to say tonight we are one of them thank you Lord thank you Lord Lord God open our hearts to even greater understanding of where we are in the end Time Lord we want to worship we want to praise we want to pray we want to have a church we want to carry on in the way you wish us to but may we not be so zealous and after our own desires that we as David will leave out a part that may seem very insignificant to us just the Levites and the Levites carrying the word over their hearts and we say well that really is not that big of a deal anymore Lord God may we not leave out anything father may we desire and hunger and thirst for all that which is essential oh Lord God we worship you tonight Jesus we bless your name father thank you for this time that we can be together thank you for your anointing Lord which I felt so powerful thank you for it Lord we rejoice in your presence Lord if there's any of these young people that are sick tonight May the angels of God pass through this place maybe there's some Lord that's really discouraged going through a hard time father would you bring Deliverance father maybe some of the parents some of those that Lord weren't here tonight and they streamed the service but they've got needs and they're they've got their heads bowed around their iPad or their their laptop there in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God go to them Lord Lord we're getting testimonies after testimonies of people that have been delivered by the Wednesday night services just a couple of Wednesday nights ago of depression and sadness and all that people that live thousands of miles away from here they may be thousands of miles away away from us but the a thousands of miles away from you and you love to deliver your children father we love your word Lord we're not here to make an idol out of our Prophet we're not here to worship him we worship you because he pointed us to you Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah thank you for this message Father oh it's cost me so much but Lord God the blessings that it's brought so outweighs the cost oh Jesus I would go through all I've went through over and over again hallelujah oh Jesus I I was kicked out by my family Lord turned down by my own family Lord they wouldn't speak to us for years and weren't invited to know of family functions or events but Lord God I do it again rejected by my preacher friends that I knew oh Lord lies told on me that's all right that's okay Lord oh Jesus it's been worth every trial every test Lord God help me to be true help every young person here tonight Lord they also have borne reproach they've been laughed at the sisters because of their hair and the dress and the brothers because of various things but Lord help them when they get weary of it all to know one day the Reckoning will come and when the Mount Zion Showdown comes we'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and it won't be long after our departure Russia will be delivering Satan too with its multiple Warheads delivered on their great bomber the spirit as it's called and we would be here too were it not for the message yes of Malachi 4 but as you sent a prophet to deliver your people out of Egyptian bondage you sent prophets down through the ages to bring them out of the bondage they were in so you send us one of this day Lord to bring us out of the darkness trinitarianism all types of Dogma thank you Lord God we worship you Lord Jesus we worship you father thank you dear God God bless you brothers sisters I love you with all my [Music] heart and broken I [Music] came thank you Lord a v Soul unworthy unworthy Soul scarred by sin but he did not despair he started over again and I blessed today he did Throw the Clay [Music] Away oh over and over he mours me and makes me into his likess he Fashions the clay The Vessel of horor I am today and it's all because Jesus didn't throw the clear away [Music] M he is the Potter I Am The Clay molded In His Image is how he wants me to stay but when I Stumble and I fall and my V so breaks he just picks up all the roken pieces he doesn't Throw the Clay Away oh over and over he mours me and makes me into his likness he Fashions the clay a vessel of Honor I am today and it it's all because Jesus didn't throw the GL away vessel of Honor I am today and it's all because Jesus didn't throw oh the Clay [Music] Away so thankful for that aren't you so thankful for whoever put that question in services that we've had brother Donnie's been on that question just made it pretty simple to me listening how he went through the Old Testament and into the New Testament cuz in the Old Testament God said I I am God and I change not and he had them prophets all the way through and in the Old Testament he spoke of prophets that were coming in the New Testament but then come you go into the New Testament Jesus said exactly what God Said in Isaiah when God said I am God and I change not Jesus said I am the same yesterday today and forever and so what did he he say there Ephesians 4 the fivefold ministry and included them was the prophets I asked a guy one time when he told me you know why in the world you believe in prophets I said show me where he took it out so now in in this day you've got the Leo seeing Church age all the way through every Church AG God's had prophets but for some reason in Leota he's decided not to people have taken what God did and they've taken a dead man and made him fulfill all five spots in Ephesians 4 they've changed God's never changed it's the spirit of Leota not God's spirit so if I don't know if you that's what you got out of that's what I got out of God said I I don't changed my plan from the day I said let there be his plan has always been the same and I'm so grateful for that because his plan included me and if his plan changed it's possibly his plan with me changed but it's never changed his plan for you has never
