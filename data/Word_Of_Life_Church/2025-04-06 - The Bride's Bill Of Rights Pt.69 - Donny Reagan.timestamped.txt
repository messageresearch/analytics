[8:18] each and every one of you here with us

[8:28] if you
[8:31] would. Praise the Lord. We're going to
[8:34] look at our prayer request this morning.
[8:36] Have a few needs we want to let you know
[8:37] about. Just commit all these things unto
[8:40] the Lord. Sister Mary Anthony wants us
[8:42] to continue to pray for her sister April
[8:45] Weisner as she will be staying in the
[8:47] hospital as long as needed. please pray
[8:50] for her husband Chris and daughter
[8:52] Charlotte. God will work out some things
[8:55] for them. We just committed unto the
[8:57] Lord. Sister Sherry Hayden says to
[8:59] please pray for my sister Mity. She has
[9:02] cancer and will be having surgery on
[9:05] Wednesday. So, we want to remember that
[9:06] prayer request today. As we pray,
[9:08] Brother Baker wants to thank everyone
[9:10] who prayed for him and give him some
[9:12] help while he was sick. The Lord bless
[9:14] you all. Such a wonderful church family.
[9:16] So, they're thankful for that this
[9:18] morning. want to remember Sister Linda
[9:20] Loris recovering in rehab for a few
[9:23] days. Hopefully, she can come home with
[9:26] home health care. So, let's pray for
[9:28] Sister Linda that the Lord would would
[9:30] be so mindful of her.
[9:34] Uh Danny Henson is in the hospital asked
[9:38] for prayer this morning. Brother Don
[9:40] Cooper sends that in. So, we want to
[9:42] remember that prayer request today as we
[9:44] pray.
[9:46] And today is a very special day, April
[9:48] the 6th. Uh today's brother Brandham's
[9:52] birthday. Amen. Brother Brandham's
[9:54] birthday. April the 6th. So we just want
[9:56] to remember that and so thankful to be
[9:59] called out by a message that was brought
[10:01] by a prophet messenger. I'm not one bit
[10:04] ashamed of it. I am very proud to be
[10:07] identified with this message. How about
[10:09] you? Are you glad to be identified with
[10:12] it? Praise the Lord.
[10:15] A lot of people look at us and feel
[10:17] sorry for us. And that's all right. We
[10:19] may we may be pitiful, but I'm going to
[10:21] tell you something. We've got something
[10:23] that the world didn't give us and
[10:25] something that the world can't take
[10:26] away. Not no denomination in the world
[10:29] can come up with what God's done for his
[10:31] people. Right? Do you believe that with
[10:34] all your heart? Give him a good hand
[10:36] clap of praise this morning. Somebody
[10:38] say
[10:40] hallelujah. Amen. Let's stand to our
[10:43] feet this morning if you will. Let's
[10:44] sing that little chorus together one
[10:46] more time. For he is Lord. Everybody
[10:49] wants a savior at some point in time,
[10:51] but I want him to be the Lord of my
[10:53] life. How about you? Somebody say, "It's
[10:56] the truth anyhow." Amen. For he is
[11:03] Lord. Yes, he is Lord.
[11:10] Oh, he has
[11:13] risen from the dead, brother
[11:17] Malachi. For he is
[11:21] [Music]
[11:23] Lord. Every
[11:26] knee
[11:27] shall bow.
[11:30] Every
[11:32] tongue
[11:35] confess
[11:37] that
[11:40] Jesus
[11:41] Christ is
[11:47] Lord. Amen. Appreciate Brother Malachi
[11:50] Spitzer. Don't we give him a good hand
[11:52] this morning if you would?
[11:58] Amen. Let's just take these knees to the
[11:59] Lord. Dear Lord, we thank you for
[12:01] another opportunity to come into your
[12:03] house, Lord. And we you're so grac
[12:05] gracious to us, Lord, for allowing us to
[12:07] be here. Lord, we ask you to come here
[12:09] today. And Lord, may you just take these
[12:11] prayer requests and Lord, you know every
[12:13] need here, even the unspoken. Lord, I
[12:15] pray for the the ones that are in the
[12:17] hospital, the ones that are at a home
[12:18] that can't make it, and the ones that
[12:20] are going through hard trials. Lord, I
[12:22] pray that you would just give them
[12:23] strength, give them healing, Lord. Give
[12:25] them what they need, Lord. And Lord, we
[12:28] we ask you to come into this building
[12:30] today. May you anoint this atmosphere
[12:32] that we're in now. And may you just use
[12:34] the minister in such a way that he's
[12:36] never been used before. May you speak to
[12:37] the need. Speak to our hearts here
[12:39] today, Lord. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[12:41] name. Amen. Thank you, Lord. God bless
[12:44] you. Amen. Ushers, if you want to come
[12:47] at this time, we'll receive the morning
[12:49] tithe and offering. You give us unto the
[12:50] Lord once again if you're visiting. God
[12:52] bless you. We're we're so glad to have
[12:54] you with us today. Let's sing an old
[12:56] song of the church. Been sung for
[12:58] hundreds of years, but I still believe
[13:00] it today. There's power in the blood. Do
[13:03] you believe it with all your heart? His
[13:05] blood. That's why we're saved because of
[13:07] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[13:09] Amen.

[13:15] sin? There's power in the

[19:35] [Music]
[19:51] He called me out upon the
[19:56] waters the great
[20:00] unknown where feet may
[20:06] fail. And there I find you in the
[20:12] mystery in oceans
[20:16] deep. My faith will
[20:21] stand and I will call upon your
[20:29] name and keep my eyes above the waves.
[20:36] When oceans rise, my soul will rest in
[20:41] your
[20:42] embrace. For I am
[20:47] yours and you are mine.
[20:51] [Music]
[20:56] Oh.

[21:11] waters. Your sovereign

[21:20] guide. where feet may fail and fear
[21:24] surrounds
[21:26] me. You've never
[21:30] failed and you won't start
[21:36] now. So I will call upon your
[21:42] [Music]
[21:44] name and keep my eyes above the waves.
[21:50] When oceans rise, my soul will rest in
[21:55] your
[21:56] embrace. For I am

[22:44] waters wherever you would call me.

[24:50] [Music]
[25:17] God bless you.
[25:19] Just want to say thank you for praying
[25:20] for me during all this mess. And woke up
[25:22] this morning actually. And if you see me
[25:25] teetering, it's not because I'm ttering.
[25:28] Just woke up a little dizzy. So, um,
[25:31] that
[25:32] devil, do you love him? Isn't he
[25:36] wonderful? Tremendous.
[25:41] Tempted and tried.
[25:44] We're all made to
[25:48] wonder why it should be
[25:51] thus all the day
[25:55] long. While there are
[25:59] others living about
[26:03] us, never more less
[26:06] still. Though in the
[26:10] wrong, Father along
[26:14] will know all about it.
[26:19] Father along
[26:22] will understand
[26:25] why. So cheer up my brother and my
[26:29] sister. Live in the
[26:32] [Applause]
[26:33] sunshine. We'll understand it all by and
[26:41] by. Faithful to
[26:44] death. Our loving
[26:48] master, a few more days
[26:52] to labor and
[26:57] wait for
[26:59] wheel that seem as
[27:03] nothing when we swing
[27:06] through those beautiful games. Amen. Oh,
[27:12] father along
[27:14] we know all about
[27:18] it. Father along
[27:22] will understand
[27:26] why you and my
[27:32] brother. Oh, we'll understand it all by
[27:38] and by.
[27:41] When death has come
[27:44] and taken our loved
[27:48] ones, it leaves our own
[27:52] so lonely and true, doesn't it?
[27:56] Then do we
[27:59] wonder why others
[28:03] prosper living so
[28:07] wicked year after
[28:10] year. Father along
[28:14] we know about it.
[28:19] Father alone
[28:22] will understand
[28:25] why two of my brother and my sister live
[28:30] in the
[28:33] sunshine. We'll understand it all by
[28:38] him. Help me sing. Father long. Oh,
[28:41] father alone
[28:44] will know about
[28:48] it. Father alone
[28:51] will understand
[28:55] why. Cheer up my brother and my sister.
[29:00] Live in the
[29:02] sunshine. We'll understand
[29:06] it. We'll understand it.
[29:10] Oh, we'll understand it all by
[29:23] [Applause]
[29:31] Brother Harold Brown said one time after
[29:33] he heard Brother Joel Brown sing that
[29:36] song that he never did really even like
[29:38] that song. cuz it was so slow and so
[29:41] draggy and so
[29:43] sad. But the Lord used our brother to
[29:46] turn it into a good happy song.
[29:57] 116 years ago today,
[30:02] a wee baby boy was
[30:05] born and a light come in the window
[30:10] and hung over him. Anybody know who that
[30:13] might be?
[30:15] You're Elijah.
[30:25] Oh my goodness, brother Donnie. You're
[30:27] going to say that while we talk about
[30:28] your birthday. What's the problem
[30:30] talking about Elijah's birthday?
[30:34] I'm so grateful
[30:36] that God sent us a messenger with a
[30:39] message. Amen. Where would we be today?
[30:44] What kind of church would this be?
[30:47] How would you sisters be looking? How
[30:49] would us men be looking? Tattoos from
[30:51] head to toe, earrings coming to church
[30:54] and shorts on and don't tell them where
[30:57] we would be. Thank God for Elijah. Amen.
[31:02] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[31:10] I was looking at it this morning and
[31:12] whenever he told about going beyond the
[31:15] curtain of time and when he saw those
[31:18] millions of people that were
[31:20] there, they told him, "If you had not
[31:24] come, we would not have been here."
[31:28] Malachi says, "If I don't send Elijah,
[31:33] I'll bring a curse on the earth.
[31:37] Amen. We've been set free from that
[31:40] curse, church.
[31:42] Amen. We're so grateful.
[31:45] Let's read today second Peter if you
[31:47] would, chapter 1, verse
[31:48] 2. Certainly nice to see all of you
[31:51] today. What a privilege it is for us to
[31:53] be able to gather together in the house
[31:55] of the Lord.
[32:00] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[32:02] through the knowledge of God and of
[32:06] Jesus our Lord, according as his divine
[32:10] power, sir, hath given unto us all
[32:13] things that pertain unto life and
[32:17] godliness through the knowledge of him.
[32:20] Notice knowledge in verse two, knowledge
[32:23] again in verse three. through the
[32:25] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[32:29] glory and virtue, whereby are given unto
[32:33] us exceeding great and precious
[32:35] promises, that by these ye might be
[32:40] partakers of the divine nature. Notice
[32:44] that nature is not plural.
[32:48] So we're not divine
[32:50] natures but partakers of the divine
[32:53] nature one which is God. Having escaped
[32:58] the corruption that is in the world
[33:01] through lust and beside this giving all
[33:04] diligence add to your faith. We've
[33:07] looked at this word several times but
[33:09] let's look at it again if you don't
[33:10] mind. minister nourishment to supply,
[33:15] furnish, ministered unto or assisted. So
[33:19] the foundation is faith. Then when it
[33:22] grows, it ministers to the next virtue,
[33:25] to the next, to the next. Greek, it is
[33:28] in the possession of your faith,
[33:30] minister virtue. and to knowledge,
[33:33] temperance, and to temperance, patience,
[33:36] and to patience, godliness, and to
[33:39] godliness, brotherly kindness, and to
[33:42] brotherly kindness, charity. So each
[33:46] step being assumed, it's like climbing a
[33:47] ladder. You start on the bottom, that
[33:50] one assumed, climb up to that one, that
[33:52] one, that one, until you reach the very
[33:55] top. God caps off our life or
[34:00] positionally places us by his adoption.
[34:04] How many like to be remembered today as
[34:06] we pray? God bless each of
[34:08] you. Father, we so love you today. We're
[34:12] grateful for all your gifts that you've
[34:14] given to us, Lord. Life, health. We even
[34:19] thank you for the trials that you and
[34:21] your wisdom allow us to go through.
[34:24] Father, we just pray that you would help
[34:26] us today as we endeavor to look into
[34:28] your word. We believe in words are
[34:31] power, in words are health, in words are
[34:37] deliverance, in words can bring
[34:40] contention, division or safety and
[34:44] peace. So we want to be a people that
[34:48] evaluates our words. Help us today,
[34:51] Father. Open our hearts to the word of
[34:53] God. Help me to get out of the way, Lord
[34:55] Jesus, to speak to us. We ask in Jesus
[34:58] name. Amen. God bless you, saints. You
[35:01] may be seated.
[35:07] So we're born lost basically without a
[35:11] hope in this world
[35:14] unregenerate fallen nature messed up
[35:18] terrible crossing of your mother's
[35:21] nature with your father's nature and
[35:23] your grandfather and your grandmother.
[35:25] You have a pool, a DNA pool, a gene pool
[35:29] by which all of these things can come.
[35:32] Then you've got the other aspect of it
[35:34] which is your human nature. You take on
[35:37] the nature of those that are behind you.
[35:41] And then we come with flaws, faults,
[35:45] shortcomings, insecurities. As we go in
[35:48] life, we have all these fears, complexes
[35:52] that we all have to deal with. Some of
[35:54] them are born with, some of them we
[35:55] inherit. Some of them are made to us by
[35:57] the way people treat us. And it would
[36:00] seem as if though no doubt it would be
[36:02] nearly impossible for God to ever do
[36:06] anything with that type of a mess. But
[36:09] yet we look around today and see what he
[36:11] has done through all of us. We're a
[36:13] picture of grace, are we not? Then when
[36:16] God of course being the one who knew
[36:19] this would happen, not causing man to
[36:21] fall, not causing man to go this way,
[36:25] but knowing that man would, then he must
[36:28] make a way to where that man can be
[36:30] brought back and not only brought back
[36:33] to just being a pretty good sort of a
[36:35] human, a pretty good woman, pretty good
[36:37] man, but actually to make them to be
[36:40] partakers of the divine nature, to
[36:44] change them in such uch a way that deity
[36:47] will be able to reside in their bodies
[36:50] and they would become a house of God, a
[36:54] temple of the Lord. Now, for example,
[36:56] when we come into this place, a place
[36:58] set aside for church where we pray, we
[37:00] worship, we hear the word preach, we
[37:03] pray for the sick and all of that, most
[37:05] of you brothers that wear a hat on the
[37:07] outside, you'd never darken that door.
[37:09] And if you did, you just forgot about
[37:11] it. You'd reach up there and grab it. Oh
[37:13] my, I can't believe I've left my head
[37:15] on. You'd never bring your breakfast in
[37:17] here and sit down and eat it. You'd
[37:19] never come in here and sit down and tell
[37:22] joke jokes or be disrespectful in the
[37:25] house of God. That's good. We should do
[37:27] that. But what about this house that we
[37:30] live in every day? Cuz one day this
[37:32] building here will be annihilated when
[37:34] the bomb hits and when the destruction
[37:37] goes to wiping out our nation. The Lord
[37:40] Jesus is not coming for this building.
[37:42] We're thankful for it. We appreciate him
[37:44] giving it to us, but he's not coming for
[37:46] this building. He's coming for these
[37:48] right here. So, we would respect this
[37:51] like that and would be so careful what
[37:54] we would say, how we would behave, and
[37:57] what we would do. Then what about this
[37:59] body right here, which is a temple of
[38:02] the Holy Ghost? Now, I've been in here
[38:04] many, many times working when we was
[38:07] building the church here before a lot of
[38:09] the brothers would get here. Sometimes
[38:10] before daylight, laying stone, staining
[38:13] this, these rails, all this stuff up
[38:15] here. Nobody here but me. And I believe
[38:18] Jesus was here, but he wasn't here
[38:21] because so much it was dedicated. It
[38:23] wasn't even dedicated yet. But the
[38:25] reason I know he was here cuz I brought
[38:27] him with me. So, this sheetrock could
[38:30] have wound up in a honky tonk. This
[38:32] carpet could have wound up in a motel.
[38:34] This walnut right here could have wound
[38:35] up in a five-star resort or whatever
[38:38] more, but it wound up being here. But
[38:40] what changes it and makes it a hallowed
[38:43] sacred place? It's because we dedicate
[38:46] it for that purpose. Then we come
[38:49] together enveloped in his presence and
[38:52] he loves to be where his children are.
[38:56] So then you mean a simple dedication
[38:59] prayer and us changing the way that we
[39:02] look at it. Now if you'd been here when
[39:04] this building was being built and the
[39:06] brothers would come in and they'd paint
[39:08] and lay stone, lay carpet and they would
[39:10] laugh and they would talk, they would
[39:12] eat their lunch in here sometimes or or
[39:14] get them a drink and you know they'd
[39:16] drink their seven up or their coke or
[39:18] eat snacks and whatever. Yeah, that's
[39:21] what happened right here. Why? It was a
[39:23] building site. But once we crossed a
[39:27] line, we crossed a line and that line
[39:31] was getting closer and closer by every
[39:33] piece of carpet that the brothers lay
[39:36] and every seat. I remember when we come
[39:38] in, you're lining out the seats and
[39:40] getting everything ready and the
[39:42] anticipation was building because we
[39:44] knew it wasn't going to be long and boy
[39:47] did we want to get out of the holiday
[39:49] in. We were grateful for it, but it
[39:51] ain't like being here, is it? And
[39:54] everything we was doing was getting
[39:56] closer and closer. The handrails had to
[39:59] be redone to meet the city's
[40:01] stipulations. So, we got that done. And
[40:03] then we get this done. We get one
[40:05] inspection after another after another.
[40:07] And then when they finally give us the
[40:09] certificate of occupancy and Michael
[40:12] laid it back on my desk and I walked in
[40:15] there, I'll tell you what, I about had
[40:16] me a spell. It might have been in the
[40:18] flesh, but it still felt really good
[40:20] because I thought about all the
[40:22] different things we went through. And
[40:25] you realize that's what God wants to do
[40:28] to each of us. So, he's molding, he's
[40:31] shaping, and he's making us into his
[40:33] image. And God wants to give us
[40:37] individually our our paper, our seal of
[40:41] occupancy, which is the token. So, it
[40:45] shows that now this has been
[40:48] transformed. It is no longer just a
[40:50] place where we're just working and we're
[40:52] beating and hammering and laying stone
[40:55] and laying carpet and finishing and so
[40:57] on and so on. But we have a right to be
[41:01] able to assemble together to worship, to
[41:04] pray. Now, thank God for justification.
[41:07] Thank God for sanctification. Thank God
[41:10] for people, you know, the Lord moving on
[41:12] their hearts and changing their lives
[41:14] and oh, praise the Lord. I went down to
[41:16] the altar and I got saved. That's
[41:18] wonderful. Oh, God helped me to lay
[41:20] aside smoking and I laid aside this and
[41:23] that. That's another wonderful grace of
[41:26] God. But don't stop there. What you want
[41:30] is your certificate of occupancy to
[41:33] where the Holy Ghost can come inside of
[41:36] you. And he don't just anoint your flesh
[41:40] and make you cry and make you feel good
[41:43] and make you worship and then when the
[41:45] church service is over that anointing
[41:47] leaves your flesh and you don't feel it
[41:50] again till it comes back on you. There's
[41:53] such a difference in that. That's the
[41:55] way the Old Testament prophets had it.
[41:57] It would move on them and then it would
[41:59] leaves them. Move on them again and then
[42:02] it would leaves them. But the Holy Ghost
[42:04] by the baptism in the New Testament will
[42:07] come to reside in us forever. For those
[42:10] of you that's got the Holy Ghost today,
[42:12] do you realize that is your part of
[42:15] deity and that is your part and you will
[42:19] never lose that? That will be yours
[42:22] through eternity. It's your part of
[42:25] theos. Theos is the Greek word means
[42:28] God. So it is that's where the word we
[42:31] get theology from. So it is your part of
[42:34] the godhead. It is your part of the
[42:38] deity of almighty God. And you know it's
[42:41] a sad thing to me that people go through
[42:43] their life and still wonder, have I got
[42:46] the Holy Ghost? Am I truly born again? I
[42:48] don't know if I am or I'm not. Oh no,
[42:50] brother Donny's preaching this about the
[42:52] virtues and it's confusing me cuz I'm
[42:54] not sure. Well, it's not meant to
[42:55] confuse you. It's meant to help you to
[42:58] see where you are so you can have an
[43:01] identification and know where to go.
[43:02] You've heard me use the example before.
[43:04] If you go into a mall and you're looking
[43:06] for a certain store and you enter into
[43:09] the east side and you walk in, you walk
[43:10] in the double doors, Johnson City Mall,
[43:12] for example, whichever mall you go to,
[43:15] and they'll have a little sign there, a
[43:17] little display, you are here. Well, if
[43:19] you're wanting to go to Bel, he'll send
[43:21] you this. Well, you want to go there or
[43:22] send you that way. It don't do you no
[43:24] good to have a map there if you don't
[43:27] know where you are. Then once you find
[43:30] out where you are, then you're able to
[43:32] look and see. Okay, so I've got faith. I
[43:35] believe that he is and that he's a
[43:37] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[43:39] him. And I believe that he's my savior,
[43:41] my redeemer. I'm no longer a sinner, but
[43:44] I have been changed by the power of God.
[43:47] But I do need help with more virtue.
[43:51] I do need help with more knowledge, with
[43:53] more temperance, with more godliness,
[43:55] with all these great virtues. And that
[43:57] don't that don't don't mean to
[43:59] discourage you and to try to pull you
[44:01] down. That's simply to help you to
[44:03] realize where you are and what you need
[44:06] more of. Now remember, when you truly
[44:09] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[44:11] what happened was that day on Calvary,
[44:14] it was the bursting of the blood cell
[44:17] which opened up the chemistry of the
[44:20] blood and released the life of God out
[44:23] of the chemistry. Now remember, the
[44:25] chemistry of the blood did not come from
[44:28] Mary, but it was a created life from
[44:31] God. And God hid his own life inside the
[44:35] chemistry of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[44:37] unlike mine and your blood which was
[44:39] contaminated by sex desire. His blood
[44:43] was a created blood, a holy blood. And
[44:46] the church said, "So there was no egg
[44:48] from Mary, nothing from Mary at all."
[44:51] And we know Joseph had absolutely
[44:53] nothing to do with it. But Mary was an
[44:56] incubator. So the spirit of God, the
[44:58] Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary and created
[45:02] in her both egg and life blood cell
[45:06] hemoglobin. And by doing that, God
[45:08] inserted his own life into the creation
[45:12] of the chemistry of the blood. Now
[45:14] remember the blood was always the
[45:16] significant sign of God's redemption
[45:19] from the Old Testament on Adam and Eve
[45:21] of course in the Garden of Eden and God
[45:23] broke the blood cell of a lamb, pull the
[45:25] skin off, gave them a wrapping to be
[45:28] able to hide their nakedness. Abel
[45:29] wasn't there but God revealed to him the
[45:32] same thing. But it was a a blood that
[45:36] had come from an animal which did not
[45:39] have a soul. So when the blood cell of
[45:42] the sheep was broken, there was nothing
[45:45] that would change or modify man's
[45:47] nature. So the man could lay his head
[45:50] his hands on the head of the lamb and he
[45:52] could say, "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
[45:54] This little lamb's going to have to die
[45:56] for me." And the priest would take the
[45:58] knife and slit its throat and the little
[46:02] lamb until the gurgling would finally
[46:05] choke his voice out. But there was
[46:07] nothing that could come out of the lamb
[46:10] that would change the worshipper. So the
[46:12] blood was simply a paint and they
[46:15] painted over the doorpost or they take
[46:17] and sprinkle it toward the altar seven
[46:19] times. But when the lamb of God died on
[46:22] the cross, it was not a an an ordinary
[46:25] lamb, but it was God's created lamb. And
[46:29] when his blood cell broke open and he
[46:33] hid it in such a mysterious form that
[46:36] the devil never recognized what God was
[46:39] doing. Now remember in that blood was
[46:42] the purging of your conscience. In that
[46:45] blood was the sanctifying which would
[46:48] take a building, you know, like this
[46:51] one, sheetrock and and plastic and wood
[46:53] and metal and stone and mortar and
[46:56] concrete and this and that and be able
[46:58] to transform it from building material
[47:01] into a place that almighty God can come
[47:03] and be in our midst. And he has been,
[47:06] has he not? Well, you take blood and
[47:08] tissue and bones and organs and and hair
[47:11] and follicles and this and that and the
[47:13] other and the spirit of God comes inside
[47:15] that body and transforms it from a man
[47:18] or a woman that was born by sex desire
[47:21] into a tabernacle of the living God.
[47:25] Now, it does not come just by well, I
[47:28] believe in the blood. That's not it. It
[47:30] does not come. Well, I accept Jesus as
[47:33] my savior and that remits my sins and
[47:37] that makes me a new person. You're not
[47:38] truly even converted till you get the
[47:40] Holy Ghost. Now, that's Satan's way of
[47:44] making it an easy belieism in this day
[47:48] to where people, well, I accept him as
[47:49] my savior and I'm going in the rapture.
[47:51] You're not going to the rapture just
[47:53] because you accept him as your savior.
[47:55] You've got to have the occupancy
[47:58] certificate stamped on your soul, which
[48:01] is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[48:03] This is why the prophet could tell us
[48:05] that the bride is blood relation as
[48:08] we're looking at it Wednesday night to
[48:10] the Lord Jesus. as Abraham's son Isaac
[48:14] and his wife to be Rebecca were blood
[48:17] relation. That was by natural blood. But
[48:19] we are blood relation to the Lord Jesus
[48:22] because we're partakers of the same
[48:24] divine nature. And when we receive the
[48:26] true baptism of the Holy Ghost in our
[48:29] soul, it was the same spirit of God that
[48:32] was in him. And he broke it open that it
[48:35] could come for us in the multiplied
[48:38] form. He was the first one to have it
[48:40] that way, but he was not the last one.
[48:43] As a matter of fact, Paul said he was
[48:46] the firstborn among many brethren. Well,
[48:49] listen to me. Then the Bible goes on to
[48:51] call you and I the church of the
[48:54] firstborn. So, it started out with one
[48:57] firstborn, but since that day of
[48:59] Pentecost, there's been millions of them
[49:02] down through time. Aren't you glad we're
[49:04] part of the church of the firstborn? You
[49:07] see, that puts every one of us first
[49:10] generation children. I've got the same
[49:12] Holy Ghost that Peter had. You've got
[49:14] the same Holy Ghost and first century
[49:17] Christians had because it was the
[49:19] breaking of the blood cell. Then notice
[49:22] with that when that comes inside of you,
[49:25] the potential of everything you will
[49:27] ever be. Now, whenever I was born in
[49:30] July the 9th, 1956, and mom and daddy
[49:33] had a little baby boy, everything that I
[49:36] would ever be as far as a man, they was
[49:39] there. The potential was there. Later on
[49:42] that afternoon down in Clinton County,
[49:44] Carol was born on the same day, a few
[49:46] hours later, and the very potential of
[49:49] everything she would ever be was in her,
[49:52] too. Yet, it took years for it to be
[49:55] able to come out. And we think, well,
[49:57] that's common, isn't it? It is. Well,
[49:59] when the spirit of God comes in us by
[50:02] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[50:05] the life of the blood comes in you,
[50:08] everything you will ever need is in you
[50:11] then in seed form. But it may take
[50:14] decades for that to be able to grow and
[50:17] mature and for you to be able to
[50:19] understand who you are. Now, saying all
[50:22] that, let's read this. Now we put the
[50:25] blood of Jesus Christ in. See that
[50:27] brings the faith of Jesus Christ, the
[50:30] virtue of Jesus Christ, the knowledge of
[50:33] Jesus Christ, the temperance of Jesus
[50:35] Christ, the patience of Jesus Christ,
[50:38] the godliness of Jesus Christ, the
[50:41] brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ, and
[50:44] the love of God, which is Jesus Christ.
[50:47] So, if you've got the Holy Ghost today,
[50:49] you've got every one of those virtues in
[50:53] you in seed form. Oh, brother Donnie,
[50:56] how long will it take me? Well, that'll
[50:58] depend on a lot of things. It'll depend
[51:00] on how fast you can grow, how fast you
[51:04] can give up things, how fast you can die
[51:06] to yourself. It can vary from 2 years to
[51:09] 20 to 30 to 70 to 80. A lot of it
[51:13] depends on you and I. And a lot of it
[51:15] also depends on God's predestinated plan
[51:18] for our lives. Myself, I've been walking
[51:22] in a spot with the Lord in the last 3 to
[51:25] four years that I've never been before
[51:27] in my entire life. I've learned things
[51:30] about him. I've learned to trust him.
[51:32] And I heard brother Brand was say it the
[51:34] other day in Phoenix and and power to
[51:37] transform, power transformation. And he
[51:39] was talking about sister Florence
[51:40] Shakaren and how that she had died. And
[51:43] he said, "Brother Deeus, we need to pray
[51:45] for him because he's got so much going
[51:47] on." Brother Ram said, "I know how to
[51:49] relate to that. I lost my mother, my
[51:51] brother, my wife, my daughter." He said,
[51:53] "But then so many days." And you can
[51:55] only know how to feel for people, he
[51:58] said, when you go through it. Now, it's
[52:02] easy for us to walk up and tell people,
[52:04] you know, they lose a loved one. God
[52:06] bless you. God bless you. I'm praying
[52:07] for you. You know, we feel for you. And
[52:09] we do as brothers and sisters. But if
[52:12] you've never lost your wife, you really
[52:14] don't know how they feel. You've never
[52:16] lost a son or a daughter, you really
[52:18] don't know that feeling. Can anybody say
[52:20] amen? Now, can you imagine God himself
[52:23] did not know how we felt by feeling
[52:26] until he became one of us? Then once he
[52:30] became one of us, the Lord Jesus
[52:33] actually suffered not only sickness and
[52:37] disease and all of that, but he suffered
[52:40] temptation. Now, any of you that's ever
[52:43] been tempted hard knows that there is a
[52:46] suffering that comes with temptation.
[52:50] So, it's your mind. It's your body.
[52:52] There's so much stuff that comes with
[52:54] it. And the Lord God knew it. Sure, he
[52:57] was all knowing, but he did not know it
[53:00] by feeling. So, he had to feel it
[53:03] himself. Tempted by women, tempted by
[53:06] drinking, tempted in all points like as
[53:09] we are, yet without sin. in order to
[53:11] become a faithful high priest for the
[53:13] sake of his brethren. And because the
[53:16] brethren became flesh, he also wanted to
[53:18] become flesh. And in order to do that,
[53:21] so when you go to him that he could
[53:23] understand exactly how you feel. Then he
[53:26] turns right back around and lets the
[53:29] blood cell be broken open, which
[53:31] releases the very life of God. Now
[53:33] watch. He says whatever that comes in
[53:36] you, he's the head that controls you and
[53:39] your feet is the foundation controlled
[53:42] by the head. There you are. There is the
[53:44] perfect man of God when he possesses
[53:48] these virtues. Not when you sing, not
[53:52] when you preach, not when you cast out
[53:54] devils. We believe in all the above, do
[53:56] we not? That's not the perfect man of
[53:59] God. Oh, brother Donnie, I pray for the
[54:01] lame and they walk. I pray for the
[54:03] blinded eyes and they've seen. That's
[54:05] wonderful to do that. But there'll be
[54:06] people that'll stand before the white
[54:08] throne and say the same thing and be
[54:11] cast into hell.
[54:13] So, I know that it's easy for us to put
[54:16] the emphasis on the bride's revival
[54:18] being this, this, this, this, and the
[54:20] bride will do this, and the bride will
[54:22] say certain things, and we've had all
[54:23] those down through the years. But this
[54:26] is what God's prophet said. I'll take
[54:29] his word over anyone else's. Amen. There
[54:32] is the perfect man of God when he
[54:36] possesses these virtues. And the word of
[54:39] life said when you have knowledge, you
[54:42] say, "Well, I don't know whether the
[54:44] scripture is just right." Now, here's
[54:46] Acts 2:38. I don't know. How does it go
[54:49] with it? Acts 28:19. All right. Don't
[54:52] add nothing now cuz you ain't got it
[54:54] yet. Now, what he's showing us is that
[54:56] whenever we get our faith and our
[54:58] virtue, and then we're going to go to
[55:00] the next step, be sure you add the right
[55:03] knowledge. Cuz there's two kinds. Yeah.
[55:07] There's two kinds of faith, two kinds of
[55:10] virtue, two kinds of knowledge, two
[55:12] kinds of temperance, two kinds of
[55:15] godliness. Oh my. Two kinds of patience,
[55:18] two kinds of brotherly kindness. You
[55:20] see, they are twins. God has one and the
[55:24] devil has a mimic, a copy which he will
[55:27] try to have the people, especially the
[55:29] bride people, and have them to try to
[55:32] build their temple out of the twin
[55:35] material. And they say, "I've got faith.
[55:38] I've got virtue. I've got knowledge.
[55:40] I've got temperance. I've got glory to
[55:42] God. I've got it. Yes, sir. I've got
[55:44] it." But which one is it?
[55:47] Which one is it? Is it the word born or
[55:51] is it the twin knowledge?
[55:54] Oh hallelujah. Now notice how he goes
[55:58] into this and what he watch as he brings
[56:00] the the twins into view. When you have
[56:02] knowledge you say well I don't know whe
[56:04] the scriptur is just right. So you mean
[56:07] you can have an element of knowledge and
[56:10] you will still question the scripture.
[56:13] You can have a knowledge of the message
[56:15] and still question the message because
[56:17] it's sort of like a smorgus board to
[56:19] you. I like this. I don't like that. I
[56:21] like this. I don't like that. That's not
[56:23] a god of knowledge. Don't add that. But
[56:26] friends, the problem is that's why a lot
[56:28] of the message people have been through
[56:29] years. That's why they've come and fell.
[56:32] They've got saved. They've got all all
[56:33] fired up about the message. And where
[56:35] are some of them today? They don't even
[56:36] believe it. Some of them don't even
[56:38] believe in God no more. Why? because
[56:40] they built their house out of a
[56:43] structure which was not correct and they
[56:45] used all twin material.
[56:50] Oh my. Notice he said because you
[56:53] haven't got knowledge enough to know of
[56:55] God that the Bible doesn't contradict
[56:58] itself. Leave it alone. Don't say no
[57:01] more about it. See leave it alone. But
[57:03] when you can see that the scripture is
[57:05] not contradictory, then you can say and
[57:08] you can see the revelation of God. The
[57:10] whole word is wrote in mysteries. And
[57:12] this is why people don't understand it.
[57:15] The whole word is wrote in mysteries.
[57:18] And only the knowledge of God can reveal
[57:21] it. But now the twin to that knowledge
[57:25] will say, "Yeah, well sure. Yeah. I
[57:26] mean, you know, I know the dates brother
[57:28] was born a certain certain day. Seals
[57:30] open on this certain day. He preached
[57:32] this on this certain day. He went there
[57:33] on this certain day. This happened, that
[57:35] that's a knowledge of the message. But
[57:37] can you be able to say, but he also said
[57:39] go to church. Oh, no, no, no, no. That
[57:42] that don't apply to me. I press play.
[57:48] I would like for somebody to send me
[57:50] that quote, please.
[57:54] Press play and obey.
[57:58] You see, that is a man-made quote.
[58:00] That's right. Amen. Yes, sir. It's not a
[58:02] Malachi 4 quote. Cuz when I press play,
[58:05] I hear him say, "If you got the Holy
[58:08] Ghost, the Holy Ghost goes to church."
[58:12] Well, praise the
[58:14] Lord. I realize there's people that live
[58:17] in areas and they ain't got no church to
[58:18] go to. That's why we have streaming. But
[58:21] it's not because they don't believe in
[58:22] going to church. They ain't got one to
[58:24] go to. But now thing that Satan loves if
[58:27] he sees us going in this way and he sees
[58:30] the message people that okay okay yeah
[58:33] right okay the prophet said that so if
[58:35] Satan can't stop you from believing that
[58:37] truth most denominational people that
[58:39] never even understand anything about
[58:40] this at all then what would he try to do
[58:42] to us give us a twin of faith a twin of
[58:47] virtue a twin of knowledge
[58:52] and it'll look so much like the real
[58:54] thing. Only those with the Holy Ghost
[58:57] will be able to tell the difference.
[59:01] Oh my. Somebody say, "Preach, Brother
[59:03] Donnie."
[59:06] Thank
[59:07] you. Oh, you're getting to be a pretty
[59:09] good man right now. You're coming up.
[59:11] See, with what? With faith, then with
[59:14] virtue, then knowledge. See how it's
[59:16] building this man? You can see there's
[59:19] no way of escaping it. This is the way
[59:22] to become in the full
[59:25] stature of Christ. Isn't that what we
[59:28] want?
[59:31] To judge. Judge right. Judge whether
[59:35] it's right or
[59:37] wrong. To believe God's word. And you
[59:41] know what's that friend? There's
[59:42] millions of
[59:44] Christians,
[59:45] millions of
[59:47] Christians that do not judge God's word
[59:51] to be right.
[59:53] How many women got up behind pull pits
[59:55] today to preach?
[59:57] You know why she does that? She don't
[59:59] judge God's word to be right. But yet
[1:00:03] says she's preaching God's word.
[1:00:06] Come on. Come on. I suffered not a woman
[1:00:09] to teach, nor to assert authority over a
[1:00:13] man.
[1:00:15] Let your women keep silence in the
[1:00:17] church as also saith the law. 1
[1:00:19] Corinthians 14:34, 1 Timothy 2, and the
[1:00:22] word of life church said, "Amen."
[1:00:26] Sisters, you can preach to you young
[1:00:28] ones.
[1:00:30] Yes, sir.
[1:00:32] Praise the Lord. And yet there's men
[1:00:35] that got up today to preach, but instead
[1:00:38] of having a wife, they have a husband.
[1:00:45] And poor blind lay to see and sat there
[1:00:47] and vote them in
[1:00:50] hell bound,
[1:00:52] abomination in the eyes of God.
[1:00:56] Well, glory. Why they don't judge God's
[1:01:00] word,
[1:01:01] right? Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:05] Baptizing titles.
[1:01:08] Oh, we don't need the name. Oh, yeah, we
[1:01:10] do. But you know why we can see it that
[1:01:12] way? The knowledge of God helps us to be
[1:01:15] able to tie Matthew 28:19 right with
[1:01:18] Acts 2:38 and say they're saying the
[1:01:21] same thing. Matthew 28:19 is the
[1:01:25] mysterious form. Acts 238 is the plain
[1:01:29] form revealed.
[1:01:31] Well, glory to God. Hallelujah. Why?
[1:01:35] Knowledge of God.
[1:01:39] But worldly knowledge will say, well,
[1:01:41] they only they only told that to the
[1:01:44] Jews cuz the Jews had crucified Jesus
[1:01:46] and and they was making them be baptized
[1:01:49] in Jesus' name. It's a twin, ain't it?
[1:01:54] Oh my. You see, it's building this man
[1:01:58] into the image of what God wants it to
[1:02:02] be. And then it will take all these
[1:02:04] building materials from the divine
[1:02:07] nature of God. Now watch, he goes on to
[1:02:11] say to judge whether it's right or wrong
[1:02:13] whether I should serve a creed or serve
[1:02:16] God. Judge, oh my. Should I be born
[1:02:20] again or join a church?
[1:02:22] It's evident what a lot of folks are
[1:02:24] choosing. Yeah. Yes, sir. They join our
[1:02:26] church.
[1:02:28] Judge, right? When the preacher says the
[1:02:30] days of miracles is passed, the Bible
[1:02:32] said Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:02:35] today, and forever. What does your
[1:02:37] knowledge about that say?
[1:02:40] Now, which are you going to believe when
[1:02:42] you say, "I'll take God." Now, you don't
[1:02:45] say just to say that, "Well, I'll take
[1:02:47] it just from your heart." But something
[1:02:49] in you, your faith pushes out there.
[1:02:52] There you are. Your faith says, "I know
[1:02:55] that he's the same. I've witnessed him
[1:02:57] the same." Come on, somebody. I'm not
[1:03:01] just quoting you a scripture today. We
[1:03:03] have witnessed our God is the same
[1:03:06] yesterday, today, and forever. We have
[1:03:09] seen him miraculously heal people. We
[1:03:12] have seen him raise the dead. We have
[1:03:16] seen him change lives.
[1:03:22] Oh my, there's nothing can take it away
[1:03:26] from you. I know he's real. Then add
[1:03:31] that to your
[1:03:33] faith. Lay it down on the
[1:03:37] foundation. So let's take a little
[1:03:39] scriptural journey for a little bit now
[1:03:43] on this word knowledge.
[1:03:46] For some, you know, it's like, well, you
[1:03:49] go to talk of knowledge and they they
[1:03:50] think about science and education. I
[1:03:52] ain't talking about nothing like that.
[1:03:54] You might be as dumb and you couldn't
[1:03:56] even know a verb from an adverb or an
[1:03:57] adjective or whatever more. And yet,
[1:04:00] you've got a divine knowledge of God
[1:04:02] that a theologian couldn't even touch.
[1:04:05] And somehow people get it in their mind
[1:04:07] only the preacher should know the word.
[1:04:09] Now, where does the Bible say that?
[1:04:15] I wonder what kind of church we'd have
[1:04:17] if you all would start committing to
[1:04:18] reading five chapters a day.
[1:04:23] Brother Donnie, what about my Facebook?
[1:04:25] Exactly what I'm talking about.
[1:04:27] Eliminate your Facebook. Keep your face
[1:04:30] out of that book. Put your face in this
[1:04:31] book. We'd be a whole lot better off.
[1:04:38] My my preach, Brother Donnie. I'm with
[1:04:42] you, brother Donnie.
[1:04:44] Proverbs chapter 9:10. The fear of the
[1:04:48] Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the
[1:04:51] knowledge of the
[1:04:54] holy is
[1:04:57] understanding. So the knowledge of the
[1:05:01] holy is understanding. So real true
[1:05:04] knowledge from God doesn't just puff us
[1:05:07] up and make us smarter and know more
[1:05:10] about it. But that knowledge is actually
[1:05:14] understanding.
[1:05:16] Do you realize a lot of things when
[1:05:18] you're going through things in life and
[1:05:19] you just don't understand where you are
[1:05:21] that what you need to pray for is godly
[1:05:23] knowledge.
[1:05:25] Cuz that godly knowledge will open up
[1:05:28] and give you an understanding. It might
[1:05:30] come and you listen to a tape. How come
[1:05:32] you pick up your Bible to read? Might
[1:05:34] come from a service. I've even had God
[1:05:36] to speak to me passing by Baptist church
[1:05:38] signs or church of Christ or Methodist
[1:05:40] or whatever. I'm a child of truth. So
[1:05:43] I'll take truth from any source. Don't
[1:05:45] matter to me. It don't have to be a
[1:05:47] message church and need to take a
[1:05:48] scripture off of a church sign. And
[1:05:50] somebody said, "I'm a child of truth.
[1:05:53] All truth belongs to me."
[1:05:56] Notice now Proverbs 11:9. Now, if I go
[1:05:59] too fast for you, all these scriptures
[1:06:01] that we're going to look at, we'll have
[1:06:02] it on the website. An hypocrite with his
[1:06:05] mouth destroyth his neighbor.
[1:06:10] I'm going to preach like, of course,
[1:06:12] that these negative sides of these
[1:06:13] scriptures don't apply to none of our
[1:06:14] people here because we just got little
[1:06:16] holy angels that come to church here.
[1:06:19] I wish
[1:06:21] a hypocrite with his mouth
[1:06:24] destroyth his neighbor. But through
[1:06:28] knowledge shall the just be
[1:06:32] delivered. So with the right type of
[1:06:35] godly knowledge, it will deliver the
[1:06:39] just. Oh, it ain't no wonder God wants
[1:06:41] to add this to our statute. Proverbs
[1:06:44] 13:16, "Every prudent man dealeth with
[1:06:48] knowledge, but a fool layth open his
[1:06:53] folly." And it's evident less is one of
[1:06:56] the foolish ages that ever lived on the
[1:06:58] earth. Well, praise the Lord. Proverbs
[1:07:02] 14:18, "The simple inherit folly, but
[1:07:06] the prudent are
[1:07:09] crowned crowned
[1:07:11] with knowledge. And remember, not
[1:07:14] scientific knowledge. And it's not even
[1:07:16] it's not even necessarily Bible
[1:07:19] knowledge, but it's godly Bible
[1:07:22] knowledge. Not just something so you can
[1:07:25] quote scripture and quote this type and
[1:07:27] that type, but something that is
[1:07:29] beneficial to you. And once you realize
[1:07:32] how beneficial is you to being a
[1:07:34] Christian, you want to share that same
[1:07:36] knowledge with others because you'll
[1:07:38] say, "It might help my brother. It might
[1:07:40] help my sister."
[1:07:42] Praise be to God.
[1:07:45] Notice he says again, Proverbs 15:2,
[1:07:48] "The tongue of the
[1:07:51] wise uses knowledge a right, but the
[1:07:56] mouth of
[1:07:58] fools pourth out
[1:08:01] foolishness."
[1:08:04] Yep. This is a good scripture for
[1:08:07] Leia. Amen. Social media is full of
[1:08:10] these guys. The mouth of fools is full
[1:08:14] of foolishness and it pours out
[1:08:15] foolishness, don't it? Come on, church.
[1:08:18] Don't get quiet on it. Proverbs
[1:08:21] 15:7, "The lips of the wise
[1:08:27] disperse
[1:08:28] disperse knowledge, but the heart of the
[1:08:33] foolish doeth not so."
[1:08:37] Proverbs 17:27, "He that hath knowledge,
[1:08:43] blabber is a blabbermouth,
[1:08:46] talks 90 miles an hour, never stops."
[1:08:54] Well, I reckon we can dismiss if y'all's
[1:08:56] going to tighten up on me.
[1:09:00] He that hath knowledge spareest
[1:09:05] his words.
[1:09:07] And a man of understanding. I love this.
[1:09:10] A man of
[1:09:12] understanding is of an excellent
[1:09:17] spirit.
[1:09:20] A man of understanding. Oh God help us
[1:09:23] all. God help us
[1:09:24] all. Proverbs 18:15. The heart of the
[1:09:28] prudent getst knowledge, and the ear of
[1:09:32] the wise seeketh
[1:09:35] knowledge. Proverbs 22:17, "Bow down
[1:09:39] thine ear, and hear the words of the
[1:09:41] wise, and apply thine heart unto my
[1:09:46] knowledge."
[1:09:48] Proverbs 24:4, "And by knowledge shall
[1:09:51] the chambers be
[1:09:53] filled with all
[1:09:56] precious and
[1:09:58] pleasant
[1:10:01] riches." Oh my goodness.
[1:10:05] I wish we would take this to heart
[1:10:08] today and start filling the
[1:10:11] chambers of our minds, our
[1:10:14] souls, our
[1:10:16] conversation with great
[1:10:19] treasures instead of hearay gossip lies.
[1:10:25] Amen. Right.
[1:10:30] And by knowledge shall the chambers be
[1:10:32] filled with all precious and pleasant
[1:10:36] riches. A wise man is strong. Yay. A man
[1:10:41] of
[1:10:42] knowledge
[1:10:44] increasth strength. Can't you see why
[1:10:47] the modern Leodysia Christians never
[1:10:50] grow beyond the cross?
[1:10:54] Why? because they're taught they've got
[1:10:55] everything they know. Everything they
[1:10:57] know. So just the blood, the cross,
[1:10:59] forgiveness, mercy. They know nothing
[1:11:01] about the great treasures of God because
[1:11:04] that's as far as they go and they just
[1:11:07] say, "Well, praise God. I'm saved. I'm
[1:11:09] going to heaven and I'm just trying to
[1:11:10] do the best I can. You know, kind of
[1:11:12] live as good a life as I can." And they
[1:11:13] never go beyond it. Friend, what's even
[1:11:15] to me worse than that is people sent
[1:11:17] around the message with the same
[1:11:19] attitude. And yet Solomon said, "A wise
[1:11:21] man is strong. Yay. A man of knowledge
[1:11:25] increase the strength. How in the world
[1:11:26] could that be that you actually increase
[1:11:30] your strength by what you know about
[1:11:33] God's word? Yeah.
[1:11:37] Isaiah
[1:11:38] 5:13, therefore my
[1:11:41] people are gone into
[1:11:46] captivity because they have no
[1:11:50] knowledge.
[1:11:53] Knowledge not only sets you free, it
[1:11:57] keeps you free.
[1:12:00] Wow. Thank you, Lord. That was a good
[1:12:03] one. Let me repeat it again. Knowledge
[1:12:06] not only will set you free, it will keep
[1:12:09] you free.
[1:12:11] Why do doctrines come up and all kinds
[1:12:14] of church deals and all that and some go
[1:12:16] this way and some go that way? Lack of
[1:12:20] knowledge. If you knew what God's word
[1:12:22] taught, you'd know how to stand. You'd
[1:12:25] know how to deal with divisions and so
[1:12:27] on in a church or even in your family
[1:12:30] and know where it's coming from. Come
[1:12:31] on, somebody. But instead, we get
[1:12:34] captivated by gossip or captivated by a
[1:12:38] false doctrine.
[1:12:41] Woo.
[1:12:43] Therefore, my people, notice God is
[1:12:45] calling this people his people.
[1:12:50] My people are gone into captivity
[1:12:52] because they have no knowledge. And
[1:12:55] their honorable men are
[1:12:58] famished and their multitude dried up
[1:13:02] with
[1:13:04] thirst. Isaiah
[1:13:07] 28:9. Whom shall he teach
[1:13:12] knowledge? And whom shall he make to
[1:13:15] understand doctrine? Here we go.
[1:13:19] them that are weaned from the milk
[1:13:24] and drawn from the
[1:13:28] breast. Them that are weaned from a
[1:13:32] bottle
[1:13:34] and a paci.
[1:13:36] We got Christians sitting around the
[1:13:37] church that's been sucking on a paci for
[1:13:39] the last 50 years of their life. They're
[1:13:42] babies. You preach the word and they get
[1:13:44] mad and pout and won't come back.
[1:13:48] Here we go. Everybody, y'all ready or
[1:13:50] not? Here I come. I want people in this
[1:13:53] church that don't want to be a 785 lb
[1:13:57] spiritual baby. And I've got to change
[1:13:59] your dirty der. And I've got to change
[1:14:02] your milk and your formula. Come on,
[1:14:04] somebody. Now, if you're born 175 lbs
[1:14:08] and you're just about 7 years old and
[1:14:10] you're 785, I'll give you a little bit
[1:14:12] of time. But if you was born about 76
[1:14:15] and you're about 395 years old and
[1:14:18] that's as big as you are, I say shame on
[1:14:20] you. You're still sucking on that thing.
[1:14:23] Oh, hallelujah. The Lord Jesus ain't
[1:14:26] coming for a little girl to be a bride.
[1:14:29] He ain't coming for a baby out of a
[1:14:31] cradle to be a bride. He wants a mature
[1:14:34] woman that will stand up against death
[1:14:38] and sickness and disease and trouble and
[1:14:41] say, "I am grown up, devil. I'm not
[1:14:45] sucking on the pacifier no more."
[1:14:54] Love the message. Folks have sucked on a
[1:14:55] bottle so long they're as buck tooththed
[1:14:57] as a beaver.
[1:15:02] They they couldn't even talk to them
[1:15:03] because they've been throwing on their
[1:15:05] balls too long.
[1:15:13] Well, it's time for you to take your
[1:15:15] bottle out of your baby bag.
[1:15:23] Good Lord. That John the Baptist thing
[1:15:24] comes in here just every now and then. I
[1:15:26] don't know where it comes from.
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:35] Whom shall he teach
[1:15:37] knowledge? Lord God,
[1:15:40] children, how can we say we're ready for
[1:15:42] a rapture?
[1:15:45] And we're still babying around, toying
[1:15:47] around with gifts, playing with this
[1:15:49] doctrine, playing with that doctor,
[1:15:51] playing with this man's personality.
[1:15:53] Let's not be kids.
[1:15:55] Let's grow
[1:15:57] up. Yeah.
[1:16:06] Jeremiah
[1:16:10] 3:15.
[1:16:12] Wow. That John the Baptist thing come in
[1:16:14] here right at the right time, didn't it?
[1:16:17] I'll give you pastors
[1:16:20] according to mine heart
[1:16:23] which shall feed you with knowledge
[1:16:27] and understanding.
[1:16:30] How many knows it's true? God does that.
[1:16:33] This is God saying it. You don't like
[1:16:34] it, debate it with him. My knowledge
[1:16:37] tells me this is ongoing right now.
[1:16:41] Thank God for the tapes. Thank God for
[1:16:43] the books. But you ever sat down and try
[1:16:44] to have counsel from a tape? You ever
[1:16:47] face an issue in your life and you don't
[1:16:49] have the answer and you do you do the
[1:16:50] search everywhere and look for quotes to
[1:16:52] figure it out and you can't find it.
[1:16:53] Don't you understand? That's why God has
[1:16:55] men on the earth that are gifted to be
[1:16:57] able to help the people resolve their
[1:16:59] problems and their issues of life. Not
[1:17:01] to replace God's prophet in his
[1:17:02] position. Thank God for it. But God
[1:17:05] said, "I will give you pastors according
[1:17:09] to mine heart." Can you imagine then how
[1:17:11] the Lord Jesus takes it? Oh my. And he
[1:17:14] will judge those who ridicule God calls
[1:17:17] pastors.
[1:17:19] Yes, sir. Which shall feed you with
[1:17:22] knowledge and
[1:17:24] understanding? This one in
[1:17:26] Hosea. It always trouble me when I was a
[1:17:29] Pentecostal preacher. Of course, I liked
[1:17:32] understanding of it. You can see why.
[1:17:34] But it's like there was something in
[1:17:36] this, brother Daryl, that I thought was
[1:17:37] so profound, but I could just never
[1:17:40] grasp
[1:17:41] it until Malachi
[1:17:44] 4. My people are destroyed
[1:17:50] for lack of jumping and running and
[1:17:53] church membership,
[1:17:57] lack of knowledge.
[1:18:01] Because thou hast rejected
[1:18:05] knowledge, I will
[1:18:08] also reject
[1:18:13] thee. So God would not tell us not to
[1:18:15] lean to our own understanding and
[1:18:17] knowledge of science and the crafts and
[1:18:18] the arts and all that sort of thing and
[1:18:21] then say, "I I'll reject you." It's his
[1:18:23] knowledge. It's his word. What his word
[1:18:26] says. Did he mean it or not?
[1:18:30] Amen.
[1:18:33] That thou shalt be no priest to
[1:18:36] me. Lord God, children, this is so sad
[1:18:39] because God called Israel as a
[1:18:43] nation to be a holy
[1:18:45] priesthood. But they rejected God's
[1:18:48] word. And God said, "That's fine. If
[1:18:51] that's what you want, then I remove you
[1:18:54] from your office of priesthood.
[1:18:58] you will no longer be priests to
[1:19:02] me. Don't let that happen to us,
[1:19:05] Lord. Thou hast forgotten the law of thy
[1:19:09] God, and I will also
[1:19:12] forget thy children.
[1:19:15] Hosea
[1:19:17] 6:6, I desired
[1:19:19] mercy and not
[1:19:22] sacrifice and the knowledge of God
[1:19:26] more than burnt
[1:19:30] offerings. So let me ask you the
[1:19:32] question. Is the word still right?
[1:19:35] Do we still need the message or are we
[1:19:38] somehow moved out of it that we no
[1:19:40] longer what do we need about it?
[1:19:43] Just certain years, sir. Just certain
[1:19:46] quotes that certain preachers pick out
[1:19:47] and say, "Now, this is right. This is
[1:19:49] wrong. This is right." Apparently, I
[1:19:51] didn't get that picker when I got the
[1:19:52] info base in the message. Cuz whenever I
[1:19:54] type in a word, it just brings them all
[1:19:56] up. That's right. You see, friends,
[1:19:59] what's missing with a lot of the message
[1:20:01] people? The knowledge of God. That's why
[1:20:03] they're so tossed about with winds of
[1:20:06] doctrine. I hate to say it, but I'm
[1:20:08] called to say the truth. It's no wonder
[1:20:10] that some of our preachers are where
[1:20:12] they are.
[1:20:14] They're lacking this knowledge to say
[1:20:16] God's word is right. God sent us a
[1:20:20] prophet with the message, not for us to
[1:20:22] nitpick and pick out what we want and
[1:20:24] what we like. And oh, I don't believe
[1:20:26] that. My church ain't going that way.
[1:20:28] Well, William Brown, I ain't make the
[1:20:29] pastor of this church. And what do you
[1:20:31] mean by saying that?
[1:20:35] Amen. Come on.
[1:20:42] Habacook 21:14.
[1:20:48] I long for this day right here when this
[1:20:50] will
[1:20:52] happen. It will
[1:20:54] begin with the
[1:20:57] dawn of the seventh morning.
[1:21:03] For the earth shall be
[1:21:05] filled with the knowledge
[1:21:08] of the glory of the Lord
[1:21:11] as the waters
[1:21:14] cover the sea.
[1:21:16] Hallelujah.
[1:21:18] For the earth will be filled. But don't
[1:21:21] you understand the bride is a
[1:21:25] prefigure of the millennium
[1:21:28] coming. He's doing in us. What did he
[1:21:30] do? He changes and our body change is a
[1:21:34] type of the bride. The bride being
[1:21:37] fulfilled in that is typing also the
[1:21:39] earth. Remember the three stages of
[1:21:41] redemption and future home. And as God
[1:21:43] redeems your earthly body, God is going
[1:21:46] to redeem the body called the earth and
[1:21:49] bring it back to that full cycle again.
[1:21:52] And as the glory of God caps off the
[1:21:54] individual and takes them in the
[1:21:56] rapture, it is another sign that God is
[1:21:59] going to redeem the earth. When the sons
[1:22:01] of God come to their place and the
[1:22:03] earth, oh hallelujah, the earth can
[1:22:06] rejoice. But even though the word the
[1:22:09] earth will get worse,
[1:22:12] worse. Bombs will fall when the sixth
[1:22:15] seal opens up. It'll be catastrophe
[1:22:17] after another. It will get worse. And
[1:22:19] that means absolutely nothing
[1:22:24] cuz God's word will be fulfilled.
[1:22:29] Hallelujah. You're prayed for and you
[1:22:31] get worse. You get the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:33] you fight more hell. How many knows it's
[1:22:34] a truth? Closer you get to God, the more
[1:22:37] devils you fight. Don't you let that
[1:22:38] deter you. Don't you let that slow you
[1:22:41] down. You keep your eyes right on the
[1:22:43] promise. It means hell hates you.
[1:22:52] Oh, Romans chap 11
[1:22:56] verse 33. Oh, the
[1:23:00] depth of the
[1:23:02] riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
[1:23:05] of
[1:23:06] God. How
[1:23:09] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[1:23:12] ways past finding out. Romans 15:14. And
[1:23:16] I myself also am persuaded of you, my
[1:23:18] brethren, that ye also are
[1:23:21] full full
[1:23:24] of goodness.
[1:23:28] Wow. Wouldn't that be awesome to have a
[1:23:31] church that was just full of goodness?
[1:23:37] I mean, whenever we come together, we're
[1:23:38] just running all over everybody.
[1:23:41] Goodness is in the pews and goodness is
[1:23:43] out there in the forer and goodness is
[1:23:45] in the Sunday school room and goodness
[1:23:47] is here and goodness is there and we're
[1:23:49] just so full of it that goodness is just
[1:23:51] running out. A lot of us are full of
[1:23:53] things. All right.
[1:23:55] Woo. Come on somebody. We're full of
[1:23:59] oursel. We're full of bitterness. We're
[1:24:01] full of anger. We're full of resentment.
[1:24:03] We're full of smartelic attitude. Lord,
[1:24:05] here comes that John the Baptist thing
[1:24:06] again. But oh to be to get rid of
[1:24:09] fullness of oursel to get rid of
[1:24:11] fullness of selfishness and get full of
[1:24:14] the goodness of God. You talking about a
[1:24:17] people I'm talking about the bride
[1:24:20] full
[1:24:22] full of goodness and look back what you
[1:24:26] were before you got saved. There was not
[1:24:28] one good thing in you
[1:24:31] one.
[1:24:33] That's right. But here's mature
[1:24:36] folks. They get so full of the goodness
[1:24:40] of God.
[1:24:47] And I myself am also persuaded of you
[1:24:50] and my brethren that ye are full of
[1:24:53] goodness, filled with all
[1:24:56] knowledge, able to admonish one another.
[1:25:00] So, you're able to talk to one another
[1:25:02] and able to receive things from one
[1:25:04] another and benefit one another and help
[1:25:07] one another. But we're living in a world
[1:25:09] that you can hardly tell people nothing.
[1:25:12] And a lot of the message folks have been
[1:25:14] around the message for so long, a
[1:25:15] preacher go to quote a quote and they'll
[1:25:17] leave you they'll quote you for you
[1:25:18] except they'll add the and that you left
[1:25:20] out and they'll send you an email and
[1:25:22] let you know too. Now you stand up there
[1:25:25] put that quote and and then there in the
[1:25:26] book it said dot dot dot dot dot and you
[1:25:29] didn't say dot dot dot I generally don't
[1:25:32] dot dot dot
[1:25:34] come on somebody and what good does that
[1:25:37] kind of attitude do any of us look in 1
[1:25:40] Corinthians chapter 1 vers4 these
[1:25:42] scriptures all right this morning we are
[1:25:44] a bibleelbelieving church
[1:25:48] now when people say they're leaving the
[1:25:50] message
[1:25:52] does that also mean they're believing
[1:25:53] all these scriptures cuz I am a message
[1:25:55] preacher. But my message did not just
[1:25:58] begin with the message in 1947.
[1:26:01] My message began with God's word. Amen.
[1:26:05] This is the message then that we have
[1:26:07] received from him. I still believe and
[1:26:10] preach and live and obey my Bible.
[1:26:21] I thank my God
[1:26:24] always on your behalf for the grace of
[1:26:27] God which is given you by Jesus Christ
[1:26:31] that in everything ye are
[1:26:34] enriched by him in all
[1:26:37] utterance in all knowledge. 2
[1:26:40] Corinthians 2:14. Now, thanks be unto
[1:26:42] God, which always causes us to triumph
[1:26:47] in Christ, and make us manifest the
[1:26:53] Savior of his
[1:26:56] knowledge by us
[1:26:59] in every place. Amen.
[1:27:03] Make us manifest the savior
[1:27:06] of his knowledge.
[1:27:10] the savior of his knowledge. And how
[1:27:12] does God manifest it? By us.
[1:27:16] Praise be to God.
[1:27:19] 2 Corinthians 4:6. For God who has
[1:27:22] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:27:24] darkness, hath shined in our hearts to
[1:27:28] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:27:32] glory of God in the
[1:27:36] face of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:41] Ephesians 1:17, that the God of our Lord
[1:27:44] Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may
[1:27:46] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:27:49] revelation in the knowledge of him. Wow.
[1:27:52] Did you all know that the Bible had all
[1:27:54] these wonderful, awesome verses about
[1:27:56] knowledge?
[1:28:01] Wonderful, right?
[1:28:04] Well, why are we scared of this kind of
[1:28:06] knowledge?
[1:28:07] I ain't talking about the quantum this
[1:28:09] and that and the other and quantum
[1:28:11] physics and the computer this and the
[1:28:13] computer that. Them computers are
[1:28:15] wonderful when they work, but when they
[1:28:17] don't work, they are an absolute mess. I
[1:28:19] want something more accurate than a
[1:28:21] computer. I had my taxes filled out the
[1:28:24] other day, Carol and I, and the computer
[1:28:26] made a
[1:28:27] $4,200 mistake. And I left the office
[1:28:30] and I thought, something about this
[1:28:32] don't seem right. It don't seem right. I
[1:28:34] just thought, "No, something something
[1:28:36] just ain't right about this." And I I
[1:28:37] just kept thinking about it and think
[1:28:39] about it and the Lord wouldn't let me
[1:28:40] get away from it. And I took that form
[1:28:42] up and got to look. I thought, "Oh my
[1:28:45] goodness." So I called the people H&R
[1:28:48] Block and oh, I went back down there and
[1:28:50] said, "Oh, Mr. Reagan, we're so sorry.
[1:28:51] We're so sorry." Said, "We just updated
[1:28:54] our computer and it it had done this
[1:28:56] terrible thing. It put this amount over
[1:28:58] here and we're so sorry. So sorry." But
[1:29:00] you can imagine now some of them same
[1:29:03] people want to put vehicles on the road
[1:29:05] and they want them driving them. Well, I
[1:29:08] can tell you one person they'd want to
[1:29:10] run over is me and you. Who would be
[1:29:12] behind it? It'd be the devil. And they
[1:29:14] want us to turn our life over to a
[1:29:16] computer. Come on, somebody. I want
[1:29:19] something more sure than a computer. I
[1:29:21] want an almighty God guiding my soul. Oh
[1:29:24] yes, I know it's the knowledge of man,
[1:29:26] but this is the knowledge of God. When
[1:29:30] we get this, set this on top of our
[1:29:34] virtue.
[1:29:41] Ephesians 4:13. Till we all come to the
[1:29:43] unity of the
[1:29:44] faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[1:29:47] God, unto a perfect man, unto the
[1:29:49] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:29:52] of Christ. Philippians 1:9. And this I
[1:29:54] pray that your love may abound yet more
[1:29:57] and more in
[1:30:00] knowledge and in
[1:30:03] judgment. So even love will grow more
[1:30:07] and more and it will grow in knowledge.
[1:30:11] How can love grow in knowledge?
[1:30:14] Because divine knowledge will teach us
[1:30:16] how to love. Amen. So instead of us
[1:30:19] getting less and less and less love
[1:30:20] closer to the end of the way, we should
[1:30:22] be getting more and more and more. And
[1:30:24] divine knowledge will teach us how to
[1:30:26] impart it to others to help us to love
[1:30:30] the unlovable
[1:30:32] because that's exactly what Jesus done
[1:30:34] when he saved me. And I'll go ahead and
[1:30:36] say for the rest of you, you wasn't
[1:30:37] lovable either. And the love of God by
[1:30:40] divine knowledge. What knowledge? The
[1:30:42] knowledge that you was a seed before the
[1:30:44] foundation of the world. And that
[1:30:46] knowledge he could come to the earth not
[1:30:48] but just a happen stance sort of thing.
[1:30:50] Well, I'm going to go down there and see
[1:30:51] if I can die. Maybe they'll feel sorry
[1:30:53] for me and somebody will come. He come
[1:30:55] to seek and save that which was lost.
[1:31:00] Amen. Philippians 3:8. Yay. Doubtless I
[1:31:04] count all things but
[1:31:07] loss for the excellency of the
[1:31:11] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.
[1:31:15] for whom I have suffered the
[1:31:18] loss of all things. Yes, sir.
[1:31:25] All things.
[1:31:27] But you see what helped counteract that
[1:31:29] loss? The knowledge of knowing what
[1:31:33] little bit we give up in this life, what
[1:31:35] will it be compared to the glory that
[1:31:37] shall be revealed in us at that day? You
[1:31:41] see people who lack that knowledge. They
[1:31:43] look at Christian. Oh, it's so hard.
[1:31:45] It's so hard being a Christian. It's so
[1:31:47] difficult. Oh, it's so hard. It's so
[1:31:49] difficult. And they're constant
[1:31:50] compared. Boy, back there in the world,
[1:31:51] I had so much fun. I smile so much more.
[1:31:54] You know, they lack knowledge. They lack
[1:31:56] knowledge to understand the worst day in
[1:31:59] the life of a Christian is better than
[1:32:01] the best day you ever live for the
[1:32:02] devil.
[1:32:05] Colossians 1:9. Let me close here
[1:32:07] shortly. For this cause we also since
[1:32:10] the day we heard it do not cease to pray
[1:32:11] for you and to desire that you might be
[1:32:15] filled with the knowledge
[1:32:18] of his will. Hallelujah. Oh boy. I'll
[1:32:22] tell you one thing. I need that. Anybody
[1:32:24] else besides me?
[1:32:27] Filled with the knowledge of his will in
[1:32:31] all wisdom and spiritual understanding.
[1:32:35] Yes sir. Verse 10. that you may walk
[1:32:38] worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,
[1:32:42] being fruitful in every good work and
[1:32:44] increasing
[1:32:46] in the
[1:32:48] knowledge of God.
[1:32:51] Now notice Paul don't say about God,
[1:32:58] not knowledge about God,
[1:33:02] but the knowledge of God. Right?
[1:33:06] You understand? That's why we needed a
[1:33:08] prophet in this day. That God allowed
[1:33:10] that gift to go back and pull things out
[1:33:13] of the Bible that been laying there for
[1:33:14] years and years and so illuminate them
[1:33:17] with what? The knowledge of God. Amen.
[1:33:21] Not the education of a theologian.
[1:33:23] Second Peter 3:18. But grow in
[1:33:26] grace and in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:33:30] and
[1:33:32] Savior Jesus Christ. So you mean that we
[1:33:36] grow in the knowledge of Jesus?
[1:33:40] You see, statue of a perfect man is a
[1:33:42] scriptural message.
[1:33:44] To him be glory both now forever. Amen.
[1:33:49] Let me close with this. Christ sent
[1:33:53] me to build
[1:33:56] individuals to the stature of Jesus
[1:34:00] Christ. Wow.
[1:34:02] that
[1:34:03] they might
[1:34:06] be the powerhouse,
[1:34:14] dwelling place of his spirit by his
[1:34:16] word. Uh-huh. By his word. See, build up
[1:34:19] the individual to that place. Not build
[1:34:23] an organization to a greater
[1:34:24] denomination, but build the individual
[1:34:27] to sons and daughters of God. That's the
[1:34:31] idea.
[1:34:32] add to your faith virtue. To virtue
[1:34:36] acknowledge, then you're coming to a
[1:34:39] place. Now, when they begin to say,
[1:34:42] "Well, we don't have to accept that
[1:34:44] today. You don't have to do it. It must
[1:34:47] be. The scriptures cannot lie. There are
[1:34:50] no private interpretation." The Bible
[1:34:52] said, "You just believe it the way it's
[1:34:54] written there." See, you've got to have
[1:34:55] these things. is the only way you'll
[1:34:58] ever be able to have them is to have
[1:35:01] heaven born knowledge.
[1:35:05] And heavenborn knowledge will vindicate
[1:35:12] the word.
[1:35:17] Do you understand? Your own heavenborn
[1:35:20] knowledge will
[1:35:22] vindicate God's word
[1:35:25] by your life cuz he uses believers to
[1:35:29] prove his word.
[1:35:33] Amen.
[1:35:36] I can see it in my mind
[1:35:39] now as I go
[1:35:42] back six, seven years ago, whenever it
[1:35:44] was.
[1:35:47] We step off that
[1:35:51] bus and I start walking out this
[1:35:55] road and there's a dry creek
[1:35:58] bed and there's some rolling hills over
[1:36:01] on this
[1:36:02] side and some hills over on this
[1:36:06] side. And this valley is called the
[1:36:09] valley of
[1:36:11] Ela. E L A
[1:36:15] H. And as we start going down through
[1:36:17] it, no temples, no shrines, no great
[1:36:21] buildings, and our guide tells us this
[1:36:26] is the very place where David killed
[1:36:31] Goliath. So we get down into that little
[1:36:34] branch. Now it's all dry because there
[1:36:37] was no range
[1:36:38] then. And all of us get down in there
[1:36:41] filling our pockets with
[1:36:44] rocks. Yeah,
[1:36:46] praise the Lord. Man, there I was
[1:36:50] standing where David was in my
[1:36:52] imagination. I've quite got quite one, I
[1:36:54] can tell you. I was just down there
[1:36:56] thinking, glory to God.
[1:37:02] Hallelujah. What did God use a believer
[1:37:06] to prove his word?
[1:37:10] Let's
[1:37:11] stand.
[1:37:21] Has the Bible lost its meaning?
[1:37:25] We still need the message. We still need
[1:37:28] anointed men of God to preach the truth
[1:37:30] to us.
[1:37:31] Do we still need one another?
[1:37:34] Hey, what about this? Do we need to go
[1:37:36] to church still yet? Really? Awesome.
[1:37:39] Awesome. Do we need to clap our hands
[1:37:40] once we get there? Do we need to sing
[1:37:43] worship?
[1:37:46] Praise the Lord. Sound like y'all
[1:37:49] getting more and more knowledge.
[1:37:52] Praise the Lord. Yes, sir. Reach down
[1:37:54] there, little David, and pull your
[1:37:56] little rock out of that dry B branch.
[1:38:01] I've got one back there in my briefcase
[1:38:03] that I carry with me whenever I go out
[1:38:05] and preach. And every now and then the
[1:38:07] Lord will let me preach on that sermon
[1:38:10] of God proves his word. You cannot
[1:38:13] imagine how effective it is. And I reach
[1:38:16] down in my pant pocket and pull out that
[1:38:19] little rock. Now for some of them, they
[1:38:21] get this look on their eyes cuz I
[1:38:23] already been flanging my arms and
[1:38:25] carrying on and they're figured that
[1:38:26] thing going to come toward them about 95
[1:38:29] miles an hour. But if God could use a
[1:38:32] little runt Yes, sir. to slay a Goliath.
[1:38:36] What about in our lives? But brother
[1:38:39] Donnie, we've got sickness. That's
[1:38:40] right. We've got disease. We've got
[1:38:42] trouble. That's right. And through it
[1:38:44] all, we're still slinging our rocks and
[1:38:46] fighting devils. And you know what? The
[1:38:49] Lord we know has committed some of our
[1:38:51] own people by the way of the grave. And
[1:38:53] it's been his will to take them that
[1:38:55] way. We still slang them rocks and we
[1:38:58] tell that devil, you are defeated. And
[1:39:02] the church said, why? because our
[1:39:04] knowledge of him and his word is
[1:39:08] becoming more fruitful. Amen.
[1:39:11] I've got a song that I've been listening
[1:39:14] to for some time. When I get where I
[1:39:15] can, I want to I want to share it with
[1:39:18] you. And it says, "I have known
[1:39:21] him in the good times when every day was
[1:39:26] sunshine. And I've known him and all
[1:39:29] these describes all these great
[1:39:31] things. But now I know him like I've
[1:39:35] never known before.
[1:39:37] Now I've known him in a broken heart.
[1:39:40] Now I've known him in testing
[1:39:44] times. I'm sure we can all say
[1:39:47] that. But I want to know him in the way
[1:39:51] he has picked out for
[1:39:54] me. I think of my little friend down in
[1:39:57] Louisiana
[1:39:59] today, Brother Tim. And I'm sure he
[1:40:01] never thought he'd have to walk this
[1:40:03] journey. As I was with him a while back
[1:40:05] and talked to him, we was talking
[1:40:08] together about it, tears well up in his
[1:40:10] eyes. He said, "Brother Donnie, I never
[1:40:13] thought I'd ever have to walk this
[1:40:14] journey
[1:40:16] alone. There's things about his will
[1:40:19] that can be frightening.
[1:40:21] But when we understand more about his
[1:40:23] nature, that brings a comfort within
[1:40:27] itself."
[1:40:29] God bless you saints. Let's bury
[1:40:34] it. Thank you Lord
[1:40:37] Jesus.
[1:40:43] Hallelujah. Heavenly Father, as we bow
[1:40:46] our heads to the dust of the
[1:40:49] earth, in great
[1:40:52] honor we serve you today.
[1:40:55] What a privilege has been given to us as
[1:40:58] mere
[1:40:59] mortals, dear God, that we would be
[1:41:03] called to walk this
[1:41:06] walk. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[1:41:09] coming to the earth and shedding your
[1:41:12] life's
[1:41:13] blood. We thank
[1:41:15] you. But we
[1:41:17] realize it was not just the
[1:41:20] chemistry, which is the idol that most
[1:41:22] Christians have made. And that's what
[1:41:25] they focus on, the
[1:41:28] chemistry. But there was a revelation
[1:41:30] that laid in the chemistry that could
[1:41:33] only be brought out in the last days,
[1:41:35] and that was that the
[1:41:38] token laid inside the
[1:41:41] chemistry. So we know there was only so
[1:41:43] much human blood. By that I mean your
[1:41:47] human blood, not regular human blood.
[1:41:50] There was only so many pints of that
[1:41:52] blood in your
[1:41:54] body. And we say it metaphorically that
[1:41:57] we've all been washed in the blood. And
[1:41:58] we know that's a symbolism. We know
[1:42:01] that. But there was not enough blood in
[1:42:04] your body to
[1:42:06] wash physically every person that's been
[1:42:08] saved.
[1:42:12] But we realize Lord Jesus that when the
[1:42:15] blood cell broke
[1:42:16] open it released
[1:42:21] Zoe. So out of the sacrificial body
[1:42:25] comes three
[1:42:26] elements.
[1:42:28] Water,
[1:42:29] blood,
[1:42:32] spirit. Lord, if there's a one here
[1:42:34] today, maybe they're just in the water
[1:42:36] stage. Maybe they've moved up a little
[1:42:39] bit higher to
[1:42:41] sanctification. Father, we know that it
[1:42:43] takes all
[1:42:44] three for us to get the certificate of
[1:42:50] occupancy. Lord Jesus, would you deal
[1:42:53] with every
[1:42:55] heart? Oh Lord, we desire to know more
[1:43:00] about you, Lord.
[1:43:02] There's people here today that maybe
[1:43:04] they'll have a good memory and they
[1:43:05] think somehow this knowledge is
[1:43:07] associated with memory. Help them to
[1:43:09] realize it has nothing to do with their
[1:43:12] their memory. It's a supernatural
[1:43:15] knowledge that will come when they need
[1:43:17] it. They may not even be able to
[1:43:20] remember this scripture, this quote
[1:43:21] verbatim, but they'd be talking to
[1:43:23] somebody and all of a sudden they need
[1:43:25] something and somewhere from deep within
[1:43:27] them, you give them your word. And it's
[1:43:30] that divine knowledge that comes on the
[1:43:33] scene. I need it now more than ever
[1:43:35] before,
[1:43:37] Lord. Oh Jesus, I need your divine
[1:43:40] knowledge to lead this church. I need
[1:43:44] your knowledge to live this life. I need
[1:43:48] your knowledge, Lord, as I travel out
[1:43:51] and go here and there to minister to
[1:43:54] your people. I need your knowledge on
[1:43:56] what to preach, how firm to say it, to
[1:44:00] know when I've said
[1:44:02] enough, to know what attitude to bring
[1:44:04] it in. Lord, I I need your knowledge
[1:44:06] more than ever
[1:44:08] before. Here, I've been preaching for
[1:44:12] all these
[1:44:13] years, but it's not just experience
[1:44:16] alone that helps you. It's knowledge.
[1:44:20] Divine knowledge.
[1:44:23] Help all your men's servants, Lord. Yes.
[1:44:26] Help us preachers to quit wasting our
[1:44:29] time studying and preaching things that
[1:44:32] don't really benefit the body.
[1:44:35] Help us, Lord, for divine knowledge to
[1:44:37] find what's on your heart for this
[1:44:41] hour. You see, Lord, if you t here in a
[1:44:45] week or so, Carol and I will be flying
[1:44:48] to Switzerland for the meetings there.
[1:44:51] Help me, Lord, in the services that I'm
[1:44:54] to take your great wisdom and knowledge,
[1:44:57] Lord. Yes. Help each of my brothers and
[1:45:00] sisters that aren't ministers. They need
[1:45:03] knowledge in raising their children. The
[1:45:06] brothers need knowledge and knowing how
[1:45:08] to love their wives and wives needing
[1:45:11] knowledge in their family, in their
[1:45:12] home. Our deacon brothers, trustee
[1:45:16] brothers. Our song
[1:45:18] leaders need the divine knowledge of God
[1:45:21] to catch the right songs to be able to
[1:45:24] create an atmosphere properly that'll
[1:45:27] match the sermon.
[1:45:30] We need it every day of our lives. Lord,
[1:45:33] help us,
[1:45:35] Jesus. Help us, Jesus.
[1:45:38] Can we just raise our
[1:45:40] hands? You and your way for your
[1:45:43] vocation of what he's called you to be.
[1:45:46] Can you see your need of divine
[1:45:49] knowledge from God? Yes. Not that I'm
[1:45:52] going to start having y'all to stand up
[1:45:53] and all right, brother you quote the
[1:45:55] 82nd Psalm and brother you quote Psalm
[1:45:57] 119 and brother you you quote Psalm
[1:46:00] 33. But the knowledge of God that lays
[1:46:03] upon your foundation of
[1:46:05] virtue that you know your life is short
[1:46:09] and how do you best use your time? My
[1:46:13] prayer would be that as a pastor, I'd be
[1:46:16] able to get some of you brothers who are
[1:46:17] so involved and love sports that I could
[1:46:20] give you to love Jesus and this word
[1:46:24] more than you love sports. Amen. That
[1:46:26] you'd put sports in its place, which is
[1:46:28] way on down the rank of priorities. And
[1:46:31] you sisters that love this and that and
[1:46:33] the other, the divine knowledge of God
[1:46:35] to realize your your life is not here
[1:46:37] just to be pretty. Your life is not here
[1:46:40] just to pretty up your home, but you're
[1:46:42] here for a greater purpose.
[1:46:45] Give us knowledge,
[1:46:47] Lord. Oh, Father, we worship you today,
[1:46:50] Lord
[1:46:52] Jesus. Can we just lay our hands on one
[1:46:54] another? Would you mind doing that for
[1:46:59] me? Hallelujah.
[1:47:02] Father, I feel that I would be in line
[1:47:04] in harmony with the
[1:47:07] scripture by praying for them in this
[1:47:09] way since the apostle
[1:47:11] Paul prayed that the believers in that
[1:47:14] day would be filled with the knowledge
[1:47:17] of God. And he prayed again in other
[1:47:20] formats and ways that he said it by
[1:47:23] prayer that you would grant that to
[1:47:25] them. So it lets us know it's not just
[1:47:27] by
[1:47:29] studying. It's not just by memorization
[1:47:32] of scriptures and
[1:47:34] quotes, but there's a supernatural
[1:47:37] element that can only reveal and give
[1:47:40] this type of
[1:47:41] knowledge. Lord, it's a marvel once it's
[1:47:44] there and then you begin to anoint the
[1:47:47] knowledge that we have by studying.
[1:47:49] Nothing wrong with studying, but Lord
[1:47:51] Jesus, help me, Lord. Help me,
[1:47:55] Father. I need your knowledge, Lord. I
[1:47:59] need your wisdom. I I I cry like Solomon
[1:48:02] of old. How could I lead this
[1:48:06] people? How, Lord God, some of these
[1:48:09] brothers, they got them and their wife
[1:48:10] and two or three kids that have to
[1:48:12] answer for. But Lord God, standing in
[1:48:14] this building today, hundreds and
[1:48:16] hundreds of people that I have to answer
[1:48:19] for that day.
[1:48:22] Lord God, help me. Help me, Jesus. I'll
[1:48:25] never
[1:48:26] stray. Help me, Jesus. I'll always keep
[1:48:29] you before the people and desire to
[1:48:33] build in them a stature of a perfect
[1:48:37] man. Not to make us a system, an
[1:48:41] organization, big church in the message,
[1:48:43] big preacher, big this. As far as we're
[1:48:46] concerned, there's only one big one
[1:48:48] among us, and that ain't us. It's you.
[1:48:52] Oh Jesus, we love you today.
[1:48:54] Father, I pray God that you'd move from
[1:48:57] the pullpit to the back, the mezzanine,
[1:49:00] the nurseries, the brothers up in the
[1:49:02] audio booth, up where the computers are.
[1:49:06] And Lord, even out on the streaming, may
[1:49:08] the spirit of God help each of us. Lord
[1:49:11] Jesus, I need it. I need it more than
[1:49:15] ever
[1:49:17] before. I need your knowledge, your
[1:49:19] understanding.
[1:49:21] Oh father, help me to add to my faith
[1:49:24] virtue to my virtue this knowledge. I
[1:49:27] don't want the
[1:49:28] twin. The twin can quote scriptures and
[1:49:31] quote quotes, but the twin will say,
[1:49:33] "Well, that don't apply to this one no
[1:49:35] more." And that that that that only went
[1:49:37] to 1963 and that one here and there, and
[1:49:39] we don't need that in this day. I don't
[1:49:41] want that one. I want that one that says
[1:49:44] it's the truth. I want that one that
[1:49:46] says, "God don't lie."
[1:49:49] Hallelujah. And God's word is the same
[1:49:52] and will always need it. Grant it, Lord.
[1:49:55] May my faith not be a faith twin. May my
[1:49:58] faith, May virtue, not be the other
[1:50:00] twin. These virtues, may they not be the
[1:50:03] twin that mocks and makes fun, but may
[1:50:06] be the one, oh Lord God, that is
[1:50:08] original, true, that'll build, build me,
[1:50:11] Jesus, shape me. I I don't know what
[1:50:14] more you can do with me. I don't know
[1:50:16] how much longer I've got on the airs.
[1:50:18] Carol and I live in a few months. It'll
[1:50:20] be 69 years old. My I never thought we'd
[1:50:22] ever live to be that age. But Lord, how
[1:50:24] many ever more weeks I've got? How many
[1:50:27] more days I've got? Sermons I got left.
[1:50:29] I want to give them all to you, Lord. Oh
[1:50:32] Jesus, I want to serve you like never
[1:50:35] before. I may not have the strength and
[1:50:38] the vitality that I did when I was
[1:50:40] younger, but I believe I've grown in
[1:50:41] wisdom and understandings. I believe I
[1:50:43] can be able to accomplish more.
[1:50:45] Actually help us, oh Lord. We worship
[1:50:49] you, Lord Jesus, with all of our souls
[1:50:51] today.
[1:50:52] Father, are they Aaron? Sing something
[1:50:55] for us. Can we just worship him
[1:50:57] together? Yes.
[1:50:59] How many wants this added to your faith,
[1:51:02] to your virtue, the knowledge of God?
[1:51:06] Maybe you walk up and two or three
[1:51:07] brothers are discussing something and
[1:51:10] it's becoming argumentative or something
[1:51:12] controversial. May the Lord by his
[1:51:15] knowledge give you something to say that
[1:51:17] will just kind of take care of that
[1:51:20] whole thing. You see the Bible says a
[1:51:23] word fitly spoken is like apples of gold
[1:51:30] in pictures
[1:51:32] of silver.
[1:51:34] Not a paragraph, not a book, a word. A
[1:51:38] word fitly spoken is like apples of gold
[1:51:43] in p pictures p pictures p pictures p
[1:51:44] pictures p pictures p pictures p

[1:51:44] pictures p pictures p pictures p
[1:51:44] pictures p pictures pers of silvermen
[1:51:47] Solomon goes on to say that the tongue
[1:51:50] of the
[1:51:51] righteous is a tree of life
[1:51:58] the
[1:51:59] tongue the
[1:52:01] tongue a tree of
[1:52:04] life wants to talk more fruit
[1:52:08] talk more life. Yeah. Can we just
[1:52:11] worship him a little bit now before we
[1:52:12] go? Anybody that's unable to get out, we
[1:52:15] do have a wheelchair. We may have to
[1:52:17] make several trips, but if you have to
[1:52:18] be packed to the car where you got beat
[1:52:20] to deaths, the deacon brothers will help
[1:52:22] you get to the car.
[1:52:25] I love you children. You know I love
[1:52:27] you, right? You know I don't wait
[1:52:28] because I'm mean and and hateful and
[1:52:31] contrary and all that. I want you to be
[1:52:34] there more than anything in this world.
[1:52:39] Sing me there. We need you, Lord. Yes,
[1:52:44] Lord. We need you, Lord, right now.
[1:52:51] Oh, hallelujah. We do, Jesus.
[1:52:55] We need you,
[1:52:58] Lord. We need you, Jesus. whisper to you
[1:53:03] now.
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:09] We lift our
[1:53:12] hands, bow our
[1:53:15] knees and worship at your
[1:53:22] throne. We need you, Lord.
[1:53:26] We need you,
[1:53:29] Lord, right
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:36] now. We need you,

[1:59:50] Hasn't it been good to be in the house
[1:59:52] of the Lord today?
[1:59:56] you know
[2:00:00] uh I'm not a smart
[2:00:03] person. I don't know a lot of
[2:00:07] things. But I am so
[2:00:10] glad that this
[2:00:14] knowledge in my
[2:00:16] life is all I need
[2:00:21] to be able to look into God's word and
[2:00:24] to see your hour and to see your day and
[2:00:26] to understand to think his thoughts for
[2:00:31] this hour. What a blessed people that we
[2:00:34] are friends.
[2:00:39] Who could do that for us but him?
[2:00:42] There is no God like our
[2:00:45] God. And I am so grateful to be a
[2:00:48] part. You
[2:00:51] know, I don't I don't follow this
[2:00:53] message because of a cloud in Arizona.
[2:00:56] Though that's wonderful, but that's
[2:00:57] that's not why I follow this message. I
[2:01:00] follow it because I see it in the word
[2:01:02] of God. Amen.
[2:01:05] And there's no book that any man could
[2:01:07] ever write that would change that
[2:01:10] because where's their vindication
[2:01:12] anyhow?
[2:01:13] But this word has been vindicated in the
[2:01:15] hour that we're living in. And we can
[2:01:17] hang our souls on this word because God
[2:01:20] has vindicated it to be the truth.
[2:01:24] What a blessed people we are to be a
[2:01:26] part of his divine nature.
[2:01:28] Amen. remember the folks down towards
[2:01:31] Arkansas way and Midwest there that
[2:01:34] supposed to been in Arkansas this
[2:01:35] weekend. The meetings canceled because
[2:01:36] of flooding and the rain and just
[2:01:39] remember those in in prayer today that
[2:01:40] the Lord would just help them. Those I I
[2:01:42] don't know how many if they've lost any
[2:01:44] homes or anything. I'm I'm not really
[2:01:46] sure, but let's just remember them in
[2:01:49] prayer. And uh Brother Joel Brown, I he
[2:01:51] slipped out of service. I went out and
[2:01:52] checked on him. He's just a wee bit
[2:01:54] dizzy today. And just let's just
[2:01:55] remember our brother in prayer and all
[2:01:58] of our brothers and sisters that are
[2:01:59] struggling and cuz we we know our God is
[2:02:01] the healer and the sustainer of our
[2:02:04] lives. Amen. Have you enjoyed the word?
[2:02:08] Amen. Let's
[2:02:11] just let's just bow our
[2:02:15] heads. Lord Bill will be leaving
[2:02:19] Thursday for Arizona out among the uh
[2:02:23] the Apache engines at San Carlos. And
[2:02:25] just if you think about it, just pray
[2:02:28] that the Lord can help me that we can
[2:02:29] say something to help those people.
[2:02:31] They're just precious, precious people.
[2:02:33] And so we'll be there, Lord willing, for
[2:02:36] a few services this coming up this this
[2:02:38] week.
[2:02:42] Heavenly
[2:02:45] Father, Lord, as I was thinking as
[2:02:49] brother Donnie was speaking about David
[2:02:53] and slaying the
[2:02:56] giant and how that he was just a
[2:03:00] boy, a sheep herder, and Goliath was a
[2:03:06] champion. But Lord, it just dawned on
[2:03:09] me.
[2:03:12] that David is just a boy. That you don't
[2:03:16] need something
[2:03:17] big. You just need something
[2:03:21] yielded. And Father, I pray, Lord, these
[2:03:23] words that we've heard
[2:03:26] today. May I yield my life, Lord, that
[2:03:29] these words could be manifested through
[2:03:31] me.
[2:03:34] Lord, we're not interested in people
[2:03:35] seeing
[2:03:38] us, but we want them to see
[2:03:41] you. And I pray, Lord, today that you
[2:03:44] would go with us as we leave, Lord. And
[2:03:46] may we meditate upon these things that
[2:03:48] we've heard.
[2:03:50] And oh God, may it bring forth much
[2:03:52] fruit in the lives of us
[2:03:56] all. And Lord, I pray today for my
[2:03:59] brothers and my
[2:04:01] sisters who are struggling,
[2:04:04] Lord. For Father, I know what it is to
[2:04:08] lose loved ones. It
[2:04:12] hurts. And Lord, you see
[2:04:15] those who are battling this demon of
[2:04:19] cancer. Oh
[2:04:21] God, thou has raised my Lord from the
[2:04:24] grave.
[2:04:27] But you move upon those who are
[2:04:28] afflicted and deliver them. For you are
[2:04:31] the God of
[2:04:33] deliverance and others, Lord, with
[2:04:35] oppression and depression and other
[2:04:37] things, oh
[2:04:39] God, the weariness of this hour, but may
[2:04:42] our strength and our
[2:04:44] joy be found in
[2:04:47] you. Go with us today,
[2:04:51] Lord, for we are your people and you are
[2:04:55] our God.
[2:04:57] and we commit our lives into your hands
[2:05:00] for your glory. Bless brother Donnie
[2:05:03] today Lord renew his strength
[2:05:05] and oh God thank you father for such a
[2:05:10] gift you have placed among us. We thank
[2:05:12] you Lord so
[2:05:15] much. Thank you for all that you've done
[2:05:17] for
[2:05:18] us. Thank you Lord as we commit these
[2:05:21] things into your heads for your glory.
[2:05:26] in Jesus name.
[2:05:28] Amen. God bless you saints who dismiss
[2:05:31] in the fear of the Lord today. May the
[2:05:33] Lord be with you be our
[2:05:35] prayer. Say
[2:05:37] amen. Amen. God bless you. The more I
