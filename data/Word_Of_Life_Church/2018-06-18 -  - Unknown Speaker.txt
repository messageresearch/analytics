TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the way of the slothful man is a heads of thorns but the way of the righteous is made plain and the word plain is paved this a divine ordained way but it isn't just him sitting around and waiting on God but this man actually so part of this man's character and trait that God identifies it as the man's way and not his way Laurie - God why the man is so in touch with God God gave him that seal in his heart the way of God is imprinted on his soul in so much that God would call it the man's way because the man was converted by the Spirit of God he used to run around is is to Drake he used to lie but he don't go no more and God so burst him by heavenly genetics that God put his own seed inside of that man or woman and breathes on them the Holy Ghost and God said I've got so much confidence in you I know you're not gonna fall I've sealed you to Eternity you are mine forever I am yours forever I'm gonna go ahead and call this your way the continued repetition of this kind of a life becomes habits of good behavior well I don't want to get in a ritual I see you don't want to get in a ritual doing right but you want to get an ax bitch'll forming of doing wrong are you an imbecile what's out of the idiotic found a family side you come from if I might have a form and a manner I'm gonna choose righteousness am I gonna do part of it without feeling I am because it's bred in me difficult in this man's way oh he's got him they just don't pay attention to her life thus awful man let's also say oh I said gravel road huh that'll hurt my feets huh I'll get dust on my new shoes oh but if I was to go for the church now I know I need more than what I got but what if I go to acts on that brother Donny oh god what if I was to get so emotional now I get up on Severson started running down the building they don't think I'm crazy oh my goodness what what about it no I think I'll just go on occasion and just kind of you know be a part of what's really going on but not really get in too deep I'll worry about brother Donny or some of those other people are having Valley probably they're fanatics well let me just go and settle it for you we are that's right football fans have fanatics wrestling people have fanatics basketball fans have fanatics I'm a fanatic for Jesus Christ I am addicted to him in his word you see the soulful person looks at of assets difficult since the diligent man looks has said where do we start sophomore man says what if I drop one of the big rocks the diligent man looks at it said God put it on my heart to come and have a meeting so it goes in down there and starts clicking on the low stable of a thing the bully of the town comes in so what's that guy done there sees a pressure so low means that hey no no making I run this town so nobody goes down there's a saying you know singing a song washing windows and doing this another get ready is that why your eyes at me I mean here the church they said although you're not around their son oh do you praise God okay all right you hear me you even have known me here you got to whip me first it all right first things first go ahead Rowley Center knocked him down God on top i'ma that's per barrel cross alone Jesus in the strength just beat the tar out of it me sir I'm the man got say first nut now slothful man would have packed up his briefcase his Windex and paper towels and left Dodge but you know what the diligent man's that I leave it here because God laid it on my heart to come oh my goodness friends may I say Donna may it not be just preachers that will say that but may housewives say my young men say it may young ladies say our God has told me to be a Christian I'm packing up I leaving I'm staying right here I'm not gonna be slothful but the source for person can be a calculator square I don't say there's no way that can work at you it won't work out that's what I was thinking too it's too big if everybody at Happy Valley was a saint I'd go I know some people that go up Erebor they got problems we don't deny that but the main thing we push around here is a problem fixer it's not how many problems with God is how many our God can take care of little slothful man I look at well I tell you so what a little bit of courage he has he talks himself out of it what's all said done sets down grabs his remote or his game things and merges himself in a world that does not in terms of the air conditioner and drinks an RC you see what a thoughtful person looks at as a hedge possible the diligent man looks at the hedge as being road level glory be to God so let's at Goliath it could count over brother Saul the rest of mrs. Lord David looked at the Prophet said his head was the size of a washtub he mention it I balls about that big around his dream and dancing in the Sun David looking at his finger stretching I stood there about a month or so ago in that valley come on tell me I felt like David well we stood there and pulled off a side of the road that kind of shot up Ike this brother Tim's putting the video and stuff for us together free to be able to see it the little hill come up like this the Philistines on this side here so on this side and a little drive broke down on the bottom I went down there and picked up a bunch of them little stones I thought mom what a privilege it is to stand right here or David stood so many many years ago hallelujah and he walked down and grabbed a whole - that you imagine look at that's the glory to God with a target that big how could you miss it but it depends on if you're a diligent man us awful man a slothful man's at all gone I won't he'll feed me to the car coz another said man says let me have it you've signed your death warrant today buddy you cross the pulse the People of God you'll pay for it this is your hour of death why diligent man knows this is my property this is my inheritance a name no for listing gonna get it [Applause]
