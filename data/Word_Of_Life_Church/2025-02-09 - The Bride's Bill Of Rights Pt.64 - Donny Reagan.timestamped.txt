[40:13] I feel like preaching after that
[40:16] song that's right how blessed we
[40:20] are to fill the pool for almighty
[40:24] God all over the world last night on
[40:26] Saturday night people got out and had a
[40:28] great big time so they
[40:30] think shot up
[40:34] drunk Affairs fornication
[40:38] fils today they can't hard to get out of
[40:41] bed some of them won't get out of
[40:43] bed cuz he had an
[40:46] overdose went out into eternity to meet
[40:50] God but God has allowed
[40:53] us to fill a
[40:56] pull yes which seems crazy to the people
[40:59] who live in the natural world because
[41:02] what they're drawn to is things they can
[41:05] see and shoot up in their arm and drink
[41:09] and and we say we're in love with this
[41:11] being that none of us have ever even
[41:15] seen
[41:17] him I've never reached out and actually
[41:20] touched him like
[41:23] that and yet he has turned my world
[41:25] upside down oh yeah
[41:29] and if he's this good and visible I
[41:31] can't wait till I get to see him can
[41:34] you praise the
[41:41] Lord are there Zach and sister Susanna
[41:44] if they'll bring her little son Ezra
[41:45] will'll dedicate him to the Lord

[41:55] lording bring them
[41:59] in bring them in from the fields of
[42:07] sin bring them

[42:25] Jes let's just B it
[42:29] together heavenly
[42:31] father is a whole little
[42:35] Ezra in my arms today I think of his
[42:39] nam's
[42:40] sake what a great man Ezra and the
[42:44] scripture turned out to
[42:46] be I pray father as my brother and
[42:49] sister bring their little Ezra into your
[42:53] presence Lord Jesus would you help him
[42:57] would you help them I know most of the
[43:00] time whenever I dedicate a baby I don't
[43:03] just pray for the baby but I pray for
[43:06] the
[43:07] parents because I realize a lot of what
[43:09] this child in my arms will become will
[43:13] be greatly to do with what they teach
[43:16] him not only by words but by actions
[43:20] Behavior
[43:22] attitude so father I ask you to be with
[43:24] them today Lord You've add added another
[43:27] one to their quiver another little boy I
[43:31] pray father that you'd give them wisdom
[43:32] and strength to be able to know how to
[43:34] raise him nurturing teaching in the ways
[43:38] of God may always have a longing to go
[43:41] to the house of God to clap his little
[43:45] hands and sing and worship you what a
[43:49] better way could there be to bring up
[43:51] our children singing loving worshiping
[43:55] Jesus when we see our nation how low
[43:59] it's gone that they're trying to change
[44:01] little boys into girls and little girls
[44:04] into boys and our government into the
[44:07] state that it's in the
[44:10] rotness how we're longing for a new
[44:12] kingdom to come upon the Earth
[44:14] Jesus but until that hour arrives we
[44:18] accept our challenge I dedicate little
[44:20] Ezra to you today Father watch over him
[44:23] keep him from the evils the sicknesses
[44:25] diseases of the day
[44:27] we dedicate his life to you now in the
[44:30] name of the Lord
[44:31] Jesus
[44:34] amen he woke
[44:36] [Applause]
[44:43] up God bless
[44:48] you let's Stand Together shall
[44:55] we be a trust trustee meeting after
[44:59] service today back at my office with the
[45:02] brothers if they would um also I want to
[45:05] mention something else to you before we
[45:08] read in the in the scripture
[45:10] today there's a little something that
[45:12] I'd like to do for our our U smaller
[45:16] children before we built this new
[45:18] facility here we had a playground and
[45:21] things out here on the grounds and of
[45:24] course we had to take it up whenever we
[45:25] did all the constru instruction and we
[45:27] haven't put anything back for our
[45:29] children and I'd like to um be able to
[45:33] put something back for them as you can
[45:35] tell I'm a little bit old to be slinging
[45:37] and sliding and all that sort of thing
[45:40] but we've got different things for
[45:42] different age categories and we've got
[45:44] different things over in the fellowship
[45:46] hall for some of the older ones so I
[45:49] just wanted to make mention that to you
[45:51] we might lift an offering in a couple of
[45:52] weeks or something I just wanted to make
[45:54] that known to you that before whenever
[45:56] we had had um other stuff that we had we
[45:59] built it out of treated lumber and um a
[46:03] lot of folks had to have splinters pull
[46:04] out their hands and their arms and the
[46:06] legs and this and that I can tell but
[46:08] looking some of them here today they've
[46:09] had them before so I don't want to do
[46:12] that this time I want to get something
[46:14] that'll be nice for them something
[46:16] that'll hold up for a long time um and
[46:19] my kids and my grandkids both are beyond
[46:22] the age of needing them so I'm not doing
[46:24] it for no personal reasons okay and I I
[46:26] can assure you the day you see Carol and
[46:29] I out there on them call
[46:31] 911 so I'm not doing it for me or doing
[46:34] it for my kids or grandkids but I would
[46:37] like for our smaller children to be able
[46:39] to have something so you just uh think
[46:43] about that in a couple weeks or so we
[46:44] will U we will lift an offering for
[46:47] that let's um turn to Second Peter
[46:51] chapter 1 again today if you
[46:54] would the right to be in divine
[46:58] order what a blessed thing it
[47:01] is Grace and peace be multiplied unto
[47:04] you through the knowledge of God and of
[47:08] Jesus our
[47:10] lord according as his divine power has
[47:14] given unto us all things that pertain
[47:17] unto life and godliness through the
[47:20] knowledge of him that has called
[47:22] us to glory and virtue
[47:27] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[47:29] great and precious promises that by
[47:32] these you might be
[47:34] partakers of the
[47:36] divine nature having escaped the
[47:40] corruption that is in the world through
[47:44] lust and beside this giving all
[47:48] diligence add to your faith virtue let
[47:51] me read again now the meaning of the
[47:54] word add because the King James version
[47:57] doesn't kind of render the right thought
[47:59] of it but it means Minister nourishment
[48:04] to supply furnish ministered unto or
[48:09] assisted so in the Greek it's in the
[48:12] possession of your faith Minister virtue
[48:17] so it's like each one of these virtues
[48:19] that are attained it becomes a stepping
[48:22] stone to another to another to another
[48:26] until we arrive to that image that God
[48:28] desires us to be verse 6 un to knowledge
[48:32] Temperance and Temperance patience and
[48:35] to patience godliness and to Godliness
[48:39] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[48:42] kindness charity how may Lu to be
[48:45] remembered today as we
[48:47] pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[48:50] your precious
[48:51] word I wonder how many sermons have been
[48:54] preached on these things over the years
[48:56] since Peter wrote it over 2,000 years
[48:59] ago inspired by the spirit of God yet I
[49:03] think I can say it without any
[49:07] hesitancy there was never a greater
[49:09] sermon preached on it than what you
[49:12] placed upon your prophet's heart in this
[49:15] end time that he would entitle it the
[49:17] stature of a perfect
[49:20] man Paul never mentioned these words in
[49:23] consecutive order that Peter did and as
[49:25] my studies of have led me down through
[49:27] different ministries of the church ages
[49:30] I've not found any others that dealt
[49:31] with it quite this way so we believe
[49:34] there must be something that you've
[49:36] reserved for a portion of this for our
[49:40] day with that comes great
[49:43] responsibility but we're not just going
[49:45] to stress out over the responsibility
[49:48] but we're going to focus on the
[49:50] responsibility but also the Fulfillment
[49:53] of it help us today I pray father speak
[49:56] to us the words of Life In The Name Of
[49:59] The Lord Jesus and the saints of God
[50:02] said amen amen God bless you I'm going
[50:06] to be praying wearing this prayer cost
[50:08] today so we keep that on our hearts for
[50:10] our brother Bernie as
[50:13] well
[50:15] God's plan is so simple and
[50:19] yet it can be so
[50:22] profound that the mind of man just
[50:26] simply misses it because of the way that
[50:29] God goes about bringing it and to think
[50:33] that God would even deal with us is
[50:37] overwhelming to me and all of our
[50:40] failures and all of our mistakes and
[50:42] shortcomings and yet to think that his
[50:45] greatest accomplishment and achievement
[50:48] Through the Ages I've often wondered as
[50:51] we gather around him in eternity and
[50:54] we're there praising and worshiping and
[50:57] adoring and we know that the prophet
[50:59] told us that heaven is actually going to
[51:02] be a
[51:03] continuation of this same life it was
[51:06] kind of a must have been a puzzling
[51:08] thing to to the people as they wondered
[51:11] what it would be and the prophet would
[51:13] drop statements for us here and there to
[51:16] let us know that you say brother Brandon
[51:18] will I love my wife and he said oh yes
[51:22] more than you do now and she will be
[51:25] something that was just be yours so it
[51:27] won't be like children and many people
[51:30] get the false false conception because
[51:34] the sixth Dimension and the way it was
[51:37] like when the prophet was there and he
[51:39] saw his wife come up to him and he said
[51:42] I'm going to see what she says and
[51:44] whenever she came up she said oh my
[51:47] precious brother and somehow people
[51:50] think in their mind oh so that's the way
[51:53] it's going to be for those that are
[51:55] Eternal mates it'll never be like like
[51:57] you were in this life that you were
[51:59] special but remember that's in the sixth
[52:02] Dimension but whenever he walked up
[52:04] before the Throne of God for rewards one
[52:08] wife slipped her hand in one side the
[52:10] other wife slipped her hand in the other
[52:12] side and they walked down together
[52:15] before the Throne of God to be able to
[52:17] get the reward of what they did so if
[52:21] Heaven is a continuation of this same
[52:23] life I don't think we'll be floating
[52:25] around on cloud CLS singing playing
[52:28] Harps and you know funny looking guitars
[52:31] and different things like that but we're
[52:33] going to live we're going to enjoy life
[52:38] it was astounding to me when I first
[52:40] heard the future home and question an 64
[52:43] which followed it and then a couple more
[52:45] services thereafter that heaven will
[52:48] consist of parks and avenues and streams
[52:53] and fountains and trees and we will
[52:57] actually eat in that glorified body and
[53:01] the fruits and the leaves on the trees
[53:04] will be eaten by the inhabitants of the
[53:07] city so the fruits will actually change
[53:10] every 30 days and yet the leaves will be
[53:14] for the healings of the Nations so the
[53:16] people will come in and pull off a leaf
[53:19] from the tree of life and they will hand
[53:21] one another a leaf and say brother at
[53:23] one time we Ward against one another and
[53:26] we were we were enemies but God has
[53:30] restored peace so when we think that
[53:33] God's great achievement is not to turn
[53:36] us all into angels I was never made an
[53:39] angel I'll never be one now I have an
[53:42] angel but I will never become an angel
[53:46] you see my angel is my theophany and
[53:50] that theophany one day will become in me
[53:54] as the complete unit but I will never
[53:56] fly around with wings on my back I was
[54:00] not made to be an angel I was made to be
[54:02] a man but I have a sophony which is my
[54:06] Angelic representation of deity and when
[54:10] you think about what God is doing we
[54:12] look at it in this life and we see so
[54:14] much faults and so much imperfection all
[54:18] around us everywhere and you you realize
[54:20] that no matter how full of the Holy
[54:22] Ghost people are they still have their
[54:25] flaws
[54:27] and the Saints
[54:28] said and we still have people that let's
[54:31] be honest that we love and we go to
[54:33] church with and maybe even members of
[54:35] our family we may never totally like
[54:38] everything about everybody that we go to
[54:42] church with you can go ahead and say it
[54:43] that's all right it's just the way that
[54:45] it is it's just the facts but one day
[54:48] everything about each of us that are
[54:50] that is not very likable will be changed
[54:53] and it won't just be the other people
[54:55] that like should be you too because
[54:58] there's things about every one of us
[55:00] that just aren't very good they just
[55:02] aren't very likable and things that God
[55:05] wants to change and if we're not careful
[55:07] we get our focus on our spiritual walk
[55:10] with God just on those natural things
[55:12] and that becomes the measure by which we
[55:15] measure our Christianity so we hold up
[55:18] the spiritual measure in tape and we're
[55:20] measuring all these flaws and all these
[55:22] faults and all these mistakes and you
[55:25] are never going to get to a place in
[55:27] lifee where you're going to be free from
[55:29] them and the prophet even tells us about
[55:31] people that create a certain atmosphere
[55:34] and he said they're nice people they're
[55:36] good people but he said you just don't
[55:38] enjoy being around them because of that
[55:41] atmosphere that they create but can you
[55:43] imagine living in a world where there'd
[55:46] be Millions times millions of people and
[55:49] there will never be anyone that you'll
[55:52] ever shun there'll never be anyone that
[55:55] you'll kind of just walk real fast
[55:58] because they're coming in the entrance
[55:59] back there and you'll walk a little bit
[56:02] faster so you don't have to run into
[56:04] them now I'm just saying that you know
[56:06] just in case I'm just throwing that out
[56:08] in case anybody here does that I know
[56:11] you all are so sweet and such Little
[56:12] Darlings ain't nobody does that yeah
[56:15] right but you know it's all of us that
[56:19] there's something about us in our human
[56:21] makeup that will never reach that great
[56:24] place of compatibility until eternal
[56:27] life totally engulfs our humanity and
[56:32] our humanity is finally changed so when
[56:34] we're looking at the stature of a
[56:37] perfect man a son and daughter of God
[56:40] that is in a Rapture Ready condition or
[56:44] those that will go before the Rapture
[56:46] and go by the way of the grave now you
[56:48] may be wondering if you're following
[56:50] through some of these sermons and
[56:52] listening to them what about those that
[56:55] have already gone and those that we've
[56:57] had many in our church that have already
[57:00] went by the way of the Grave where will
[57:02] they fit brother Donnie did they arrived
[57:05] to that place yes the elect of God
[57:08] arrived at that place before they left
[57:11] this world but remember much of the
[57:14] preaching that will continue on years
[57:17] after they're gone is not just
[57:20] supplementing us in our spiritual walk
[57:22] with God but it's giving us the
[57:24] spiritual sust
[57:26] and strength that we need my daughter
[57:29] Erica no longer needs to hear sermons
[57:32] preached about faith and sermons about
[57:35] forgiveness sermons about love and
[57:37] sermons about things like that but I
[57:40] still meet them because I'm still
[57:41] dealing with human beings you all need
[57:43] them how many still needs to hear
[57:45] forgiveness preached how many needs more
[57:48] forgiveness in your heart so all of
[57:50] those Saints before the Lord takes them
[57:53] they arrive to that spot and then
[57:56] they're able to be sealed away into the
[57:59] kingdom of God but also into the church
[58:02] AGS that they live now remember the Lord
[58:04] will never take one of his elect seed
[58:08] from this Earth before they have arrived
[58:11] and the last few days of their life
[58:14] might be the finishing touches that they
[58:17] need or the last few weeks I've seen it
[58:20] so many times myself and watch as the
[58:24] children of God are are losing losing
[58:26] life and they're coming down to that
[58:28] spot and you just watch and as a pastor
[58:31] me knowing things about them and in my
[58:34] heart be troubled about certain things
[58:36] about them and be praying for them of
[58:39] course and if I feel in my heart to say
[58:41] something to him and watch God one after
[58:45] another after another take care of that
[58:48] little something that's lacking in their
[58:51] life and in their walk with God because
[58:54] he is not going to do a halfway job on
[58:57] any of his children you have that
[59:00] confidence in him I have it not on in it
[59:02] for me but I have it for you as well so
[59:06] he's going to do whatever we La so as
[59:08] we're looking at this don't look at it
[59:11] as it's absolutely totally impossible
[59:13] it's not and the hard part is being able
[59:16] to differentiate between us measuring
[59:19] the flawed human part and the Soul part
[59:23] which will be able to manifest every one
[59:25] of these attributes that God wants and I
[59:28] I find it amazing as the prophet would
[59:30] bring this that he would bring different
[59:33] parallels of the scripture and he would
[59:35] kind of cross the types back and forth
[59:38] and he would bring it as it was a body
[59:42] he would bring it as it was a natural
[59:44] body it's also a m mystical body and
[59:47] here in Statue of a perfect man he says
[59:49] this is the house that God dwells in not
[59:52] a body with a big Bell on the top of it
[59:55] and a high steeple but a body H has thou
[59:58] prepared me now in the natural sense we
[1:00:01] had all kinds of issues when we were
[1:00:04] building this building right here we had
[1:00:06] all types of stipulations and I honestly
[1:00:10] think the city made new laws is we was
[1:00:13] building this building because they made
[1:00:15] things made us do this and do that and
[1:00:18] the other and it seemed like every
[1:00:20] inspector that we dealt with had his own
[1:00:22] agenda against us and they made us do
[1:00:24] certain things that the Builders said
[1:00:26] they had never seen anybody else be
[1:00:29] required to do well if they made it hard
[1:00:32] on us because of who we were God will
[1:00:35] make them answer the day of judgment for
[1:00:36] that but I see that as also in the
[1:00:40] spiritual sense that there's certain
[1:00:42] things now before we could move in here
[1:00:44] and they would give us the final
[1:00:46] inspection and what is known as a
[1:00:48] certificate of occupancy and they gave
[1:00:51] that to I guess brother Michael was the
[1:00:53] one that got it he gave it to me laid it
[1:00:54] on my desk oh it was an absolute Victory
[1:00:59] whenever I walked in the office and I
[1:01:01] saw it laying there with our name on it
[1:01:04] and the date and so on and so on and
[1:01:07] they gave us the official certificate of
[1:01:10] occupancy and our building was rated to
[1:01:13] be able to seat
[1:01:16] 1,1 people now that was all wonderful
[1:01:19] and all but you know what it gave us a
[1:01:21] right to do to be able to no longer meet
[1:01:24] to work on it no long longer to meet and
[1:01:27] paint it and lay carpet and lay stone
[1:01:30] but it actually gave us the legal right
[1:01:33] to where we could meet hundreds of us at
[1:01:36] one time and that way the city would
[1:01:39] come by and they wouldn't throw us out
[1:01:41] and shut us down now this is what we're
[1:01:43] looking for and our certificate of
[1:01:47] occupancy from the presence of God now
[1:01:50] all along there have been brothers that
[1:01:52] was meeting all times of building
[1:01:54] contractors trainers electrician you
[1:01:57] know men doing different types of things
[1:01:59] in the screens and the audio and the
[1:02:02] video all kinds of people were coming
[1:02:04] and going so it wasn't like that there
[1:02:07] were not human beings that were in this
[1:02:09] building and some of us I can tell you
[1:02:12] it felt like we were living here because
[1:02:14] we were here from before daylight there
[1:02:16] was days I showed up here at 4:00 in the
[1:02:18] morning and I wouldn't leave till 600 or
[1:02:21] 7:00 at night and yet it felt like I was
[1:02:24] living here Carol felt like I was living
[1:02:26] here but it wasn't really my permanent
[1:02:29] residence but everything I was doing it
[1:02:33] was getting it closer to that day when
[1:02:36] we could open for the first time and we
[1:02:39] could invite the presence of God but we
[1:02:41] could also invite you to be able to come
[1:02:44] and we wouldn't be worried about
[1:02:46] somebody from the city showing up and
[1:02:48] say you all can't do this well you see
[1:02:51] that's where we are now we're in this
[1:02:54] stage to where God has started this work
[1:02:57] inside of us and many of you go back and
[1:03:00] listen to the Statue of a perfect man
[1:03:02] Blasphemous names a few excerpts from
[1:03:04] the ordination of the minister also why
[1:03:07] against organized religion some of the
[1:03:09] different places that the prophet would
[1:03:11] refer to this and it might make you
[1:03:13] wonder well where am I on this chart
[1:03:16] where am I on this statue of a perfect
[1:03:18] man and I don't mind telling you every
[1:03:20] time that I knew that the inspectors was
[1:03:23] going to come in it was a nervous day
[1:03:26] for me because it seemed like everything
[1:03:28] we'd take care of that'd always come
[1:03:31] back with something else and this needed
[1:03:34] to be done this way they come in and we
[1:03:36] thought we had all these panels just
[1:03:38] exactly right now you don't know it but
[1:03:41] run in behind all of these walls are all
[1:03:43] types of plumbing and all types of
[1:03:46] different things they were so nice but
[1:03:49] the city and Spectre come in and made us
[1:03:51] redo it so we had to cut holes in it you
[1:03:54] see this so Square panel right here got
[1:03:57] a little tiny piece of tape down on the
[1:03:59] bottom of it that was a code violation
[1:04:03] so we had to be able to redo it and then
[1:04:06] they would write off well then we'd meet
[1:04:09] their great specific desire and would
[1:04:12] come in and brother Phil and his crew
[1:04:14] did all the handrails and they come in
[1:04:16] and looked at them they done a
[1:04:18] tremendous job look beautiful they come
[1:04:20] in and look at them and say that won't
[1:04:22] work it's got to be done this way and
[1:04:24] this way and this way you don't what we
[1:04:26] had to do redo every one of them so they
[1:04:29] come in and we fix this and then they
[1:04:31] find something else and they fix that
[1:04:34] and they find something else that's the
[1:04:36] way it is in our lives you know so I
[1:04:39] said why don't they just come in and
[1:04:41] give us a list and we'll do it all at
[1:04:44] one time and be done but you know what I
[1:04:47] found out that ain't the way they do it
[1:04:49] they want you to fix this and then they
[1:04:51] come back you fix that you know as I've
[1:04:54] been looking at this I realize that God
[1:04:57] does us in a very similar way brother
[1:04:59] Rudy that we fix this in our life and
[1:05:02] then God come in and expecting said yeah
[1:05:05] you're looking good so here's another
[1:05:07] list and you say my Lord I thought I was
[1:05:09] expecting my certificate of occupant he
[1:05:12] said oh no no you're a good way from the
[1:05:15] capping it you're work in progress and
[1:05:18] you already have the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:22] Ghost and it's already immersed you into
[1:05:25] that m IAL part but these things are
[1:05:27] living out of you so it starts off of
[1:05:31] course with the the new birth and it
[1:05:33] begins then with the very first one that
[1:05:36] is there is Faith and you cannot believe
[1:05:39] in any of these things without faith
[1:05:41] being there and then one's Faith becomes
[1:05:44] a a dominant force and a dominant power
[1:05:47] in your life not only to save you but to
[1:05:50] heal you but to deliver you and this is
[1:05:53] the thing about faith that Faith's
[1:05:55] understand understands that God says yes
[1:05:58] and Faith also understands God says
[1:06:01] sometimes wait a while Faith also
[1:06:04] understands that God says
[1:06:06] no sometimes now emotional faith gets
[1:06:11] tore all to pieces When God says
[1:06:16] no emotional faith will absolutely
[1:06:20] destroy an individual whenever they are
[1:06:23] expecting a yes but God gives them a
[1:06:26] resounding no but real Faith believes
[1:06:31] him even when he says no because they
[1:06:35] know he knows more about it than they do
[1:06:38] and the church said now we've all had
[1:06:41] nose have we not and no doubt we'll get
[1:06:43] more of them and I've got to be honest
[1:06:46] you know I I don't like the nose as well
[1:06:48] initially whenever he gives them because
[1:06:50] we have anticipation for yeses and we're
[1:06:53] looking at yeses and thinking in our
[1:06:55] mind and our heart that the yes is
[1:06:57] always bringing more Glory but that's
[1:07:00] not necessarily the truth sometimes NOS
[1:07:04] will actually bring him more Glory
[1:07:06] because a no leads into many many weeks
[1:07:10] or months of Trials of misunderstandings
[1:07:14] and trying to you know figure it all out
[1:07:16] in our mind and when we're going through
[1:07:19] what seems like a rejection of a no
[1:07:21] because just be honest a no from God
[1:07:24] seems like a rejection but sometimes
[1:07:28] it's actually a greater display of his
[1:07:31] glory than had he brought it with a yes
[1:07:35] and the church said amen now if we start
[1:07:38] out with faith which comes from the
[1:07:41] spirit of God giving us the ability if
[1:07:44] any person comes to God they first must
[1:07:47] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:07:49] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:07:53] him now watch I I I've never found were
[1:07:55] brother brandom ever liken this again
[1:07:58] because it's quite astounding because
[1:08:00] he's quoting the scripture that referred
[1:08:03] to the Lord Jesus and it was of the
[1:08:05] prophet of the Old Testament where that
[1:08:07] he prophesied and said lo I come in the
[1:08:10] volume of the book and lo a body hast
[1:08:13] thou prepared me so he quotes this and
[1:08:16] he said a body has thou prepared me a
[1:08:18] body that God can dwell in so now he
[1:08:21] takes that Prophecy of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:25] and runs a parallel to his bride so as
[1:08:29] the Lord Jesus was the body the human
[1:08:32] body that God could walk in so this is
[1:08:35] what we call the son of God then God
[1:08:39] walked in the Son of God so God was made
[1:08:42] a son in the flesh of the Lord Jesus and
[1:08:46] then he applies this same scripture then
[1:08:49] on down to the extension of that which
[1:08:51] is the body of the Lord Jesus so now
[1:08:55] where is is the Corporal body of Jesus
[1:08:57] of course it's on the throne of God so
[1:09:00] you believe Jesus has eyes on the
[1:09:02] earth you believe Jesus has hands on the
[1:09:06] earth well where are they here's two of
[1:09:09] them there's two more there's two more
[1:09:12] there's two more you believe Jesus have
[1:09:14] has got mouths on the earth how many
[1:09:17] want your mouth to be his what about
[1:09:19] ears What About Eyes what about the
[1:09:22] ability maybe sometimes just to put your
[1:09:24] arms around a brother and just let him
[1:09:26] know that you love him and that you're
[1:09:28] praying for him you understand what that
[1:09:29] is that can be Jesus that can be Jesus I
[1:09:33] I'll never forget it there was a man
[1:09:35] that used to attend our church years and
[1:09:36] years ago and he he came into the office
[1:09:39] one day back at the old place and he he
[1:09:42] wanted to talk to me and uh you know the
[1:09:45] conversation that he and I had it didn't
[1:09:47] go really good because he he he believed
[1:09:50] some different types of things and kind
[1:09:52] of strange things but I I've sitting
[1:09:54] there praying and I said Lord please
[1:09:56] help me help me to have the right
[1:09:58] attitude help me to be able to to to let
[1:10:00] this man exceed the real love of God and
[1:10:04] as we finished our discussion and he
[1:10:07] didn't change me and it was eite I
[1:10:09] didn't change him but as we finish the
[1:10:12] discussion I said brother you mind if I
[1:10:14] shake your hand before you go and he
[1:10:16] said no no that's fine brother so I took
[1:10:18] him by the hand and as I did I was just
[1:10:21] praying God please help me emanate your
[1:10:24] presence
[1:10:25] in such a way that this man will feel
[1:10:28] enveloped in your being as I took him by
[1:10:32] the hand like this and I put my arm
[1:10:34] around him he was taller than me but I I
[1:10:36] pulled him kind of close to me and I
[1:10:39] just stood there with him you know with
[1:10:41] my arms around him and he he broke down
[1:10:44] and started crying and he he told
[1:10:47] someone else from the from our church
[1:10:49] sometime later he said I've been in the
[1:10:51] presence of God since I was a child I've
[1:10:55] shouted I've spoken tongues I've told
[1:10:57] all different manifestations of this
[1:10:59] that and the other but he said I have
[1:11:01] never and my entire walk with God felt
[1:11:05] such a presence and it was like it was
[1:11:08] coming from brother
[1:11:11] Donnie now you know I cannot do that you
[1:11:14] know no human being can do that but I
[1:11:18] saw in my heart once to come back to me
[1:11:21] uh quite sometime later what greater
[1:11:24] thing could you and I do as the people
[1:11:27] of God that for the Lord Jesus now
[1:11:31] Donnie Reagan don't have any presence
[1:11:33] aren't that I'm not a great person I
[1:11:35] don't have an aura about me that's
[1:11:37] really wonderful and fine and all that
[1:11:40] sort of thing but what I desire is that
[1:11:43] people can be able to know that greater
[1:11:47] is he that is in me than he that is in
[1:11:50] the world and that though people might
[1:11:52] differ with you and I now you know I I
[1:11:54] guess for me looking at it I could have
[1:11:57] thought that it would have been a
[1:11:59] greater happening had it been a more
[1:12:01] pleasant type of conversation and it
[1:12:04] would have been something that would
[1:12:06] have just been rejoicing and
[1:12:08] fellowshipping but that wasn't really
[1:12:10] the way that it went no neither of us
[1:12:12] were argumented or anything like that
[1:12:14] but yet it just you know it just wasn't
[1:12:17] quite in the way that I wish it would
[1:12:18] have been but the Lord wanted to cap off
[1:12:23] a negative type of situation but he
[1:12:26] wanted to cap it off with his presence
[1:12:30] now I had the spirit of God and I
[1:12:33] believe that brother had the spirit of
[1:12:35] God but God wanted to cap off that
[1:12:39] meeting with something that would change
[1:12:43] that brother's life and I don't mind to
[1:12:45] be honest with you every time I talk
[1:12:46] about it and it's been years and years
[1:12:48] ago I still feel that's something inside
[1:12:51] of me I'm feeling it right now as I'm
[1:12:52] talking about it because it was a
[1:12:55] presence of God quite unlike anything
[1:12:57] I'd ever experienced before myself I've
[1:13:00] shouted and Run and Jump and dance and
[1:13:02] done all types of emotional Outburst but
[1:13:04] it was is as if though someone had
[1:13:08] embodied me for a few moments using my
[1:13:12] mouth using my arm my hand to embrace
[1:13:17] this brother and you know my my friends
[1:13:20] I desire more than anything in my life
[1:13:24] for for that to be something that is so
[1:13:27] prevalent in my life I've seen God heal
[1:13:31] the sick I've seen God perform Mighty
[1:13:34] Miracles and signs and wonders and I
[1:13:36] love every one of them and I thank God
[1:13:39] for that but to me there's something
[1:13:42] about his person that I value even more
[1:13:47] than I do those signs and wonders and
[1:13:51] miracles I love gifts I thank God for
[1:13:54] the gifts but yet I don't just want the
[1:13:57] gifts I want the life of the gifts as
[1:14:01] well because we've all seen people that
[1:14:03] would manifest gifts and then know what
[1:14:06] kind of life that they lived outside the
[1:14:08] word and that right that it wasn't even
[1:14:11] the spirit of God so sure let's have the
[1:14:14] gifts let's let's use the gifts that God
[1:14:17] gives us but let's not leave out the
[1:14:20] most important part which is the very
[1:14:23] life and essence of God's Own nature
[1:14:26] after all when we get to heaven when we
[1:14:29] go beyond the curtain of time for those
[1:14:32] of us who will go there before the
[1:14:34] Resurrection The Prophet never mentioned
[1:14:37] one person beyond the curtain of time
[1:14:40] that spoke in tongues he never mentioned
[1:14:43] one person that had a dream or a vision
[1:14:46] one person that interpreted one person
[1:14:50] that prophesied and all the references
[1:14:53] that I found and cross reference back
[1:14:55] back and forth he never mentioned
[1:14:57] anything about the display of the gifts
[1:15:00] why in the sixth Dimension they didn't
[1:15:03] need them but what was the predominant
[1:15:06] Factor Divine love perfect love oh now
[1:15:12] this is why I know it stumbles some
[1:15:14] people in the message it shouldn't
[1:15:15] really but brother brandham said that he
[1:15:17] he longed for the time when the gifts
[1:15:20] would be laid up on the shelf and the
[1:15:22] love of God would Comm in the church and
[1:15:25] just take the church over he was not
[1:15:27] against gifts my goodness he preached
[1:15:28] many many sermons after he said that in
[1:15:30] 1956 I believe it was about the
[1:15:33] necessity of the gifts in the church but
[1:15:36] yet he focused on what was the priority
[1:15:40] of getting Divine love then if we get
[1:15:42] Divine love then the gifts that'll flow
[1:15:45] through it to the Avenue of divine love
[1:15:48] how many want more that in your life now
[1:15:50] what God wants us to be is a body a body
[1:15:54] has thou prepared me a body that God can
[1:15:58] dwell in God can walk in God can see in
[1:16:02] God can talk in God can work in amen
[1:16:06] living
[1:16:07] instrumentality of God God walking on
[1:16:11] two feet in you the footsteps of the
[1:16:15] righteous is ordered of God God walking
[1:16:18] in you for ye are written Epistles read
[1:16:21] of all men and if the life that is if
[1:16:25] it's in Christ be in you it'll bear the
[1:16:27] life that Christ bore is that right
[1:16:31] notice again he said now we put the
[1:16:33] blood of Jesus Christ in notice what
[1:16:36] happens whenever we come to him now
[1:16:39] remember there's three step stages of
[1:16:41] the new birth that is justification by
[1:16:44] faith sanctification of the spirit and
[1:16:47] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now I
[1:16:49] can become a little bit confusing now
[1:16:51] because there was a Pentecostal age
[1:16:55] before the token life now for those of
[1:16:58] you that were never there it might seem
[1:17:00] very unusual to you and you've heard me
[1:17:02] say it before that I believe I received
[1:17:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost whenever I
[1:17:09] was a child many of you some of you I
[1:17:11] should say come from Pentecost and no
[1:17:14] doubt you received something from the
[1:17:16] presence of God when you were in
[1:17:18] Pentecost because our life changed but
[1:17:21] yet unlike others who've come to the
[1:17:23] message and believed all they needed was
[1:17:26] a change in their theology I believe
[1:17:29] that I needed a furthering of my
[1:17:32] experience in God to match the message I
[1:17:37] believe that I'm I was missing something
[1:17:40] in Pentecost and I found out what it was
[1:17:43] it was the token which is not exactly
[1:17:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the
[1:17:49] true baptism in the Holy Ghost in the
[1:17:52] true realm which is the realm of the
[1:17:54] Soul now whenever brother brandham is
[1:17:57] laying this out remember that he starts
[1:17:59] out with the new birth what you also
[1:18:02] have to keep in mind now in this time
[1:18:04] frame in
[1:18:05] 1962 he's still believing and of the
[1:18:08] mindset that the new birth is you
[1:18:11] receiving Christ as your
[1:18:15] savior
[1:18:18] amen testing 1 2 3 1 2 3 come on friends
[1:18:22] let's let him advance in his understand
[1:18:25] let's let him advance in his Revelation
[1:18:27] before God now look I do not compare
[1:18:30] what the prophet said to what I believe
[1:18:33] I compare what the prophet said to what
[1:18:36] the prophet said okay okay not what I
[1:18:40] believe I'm not interested in your
[1:18:42] opinion I'm not interested in what you
[1:18:44] think I'm interested in what he said but
[1:18:47] I am going to compare what he said to
[1:18:50] what he said and if I see that he grew I
[1:18:53] have no problem what whatsoever and
[1:18:55] preaching that gross and I have no
[1:18:57] problem in preaching it to you and
[1:18:59] preaching it in the message I know
[1:19:01] people don't like it when you do it but
[1:19:03] I'm called to preach the message and if
[1:19:05] I can't preach it all I ain't going to
[1:19:07] preach none of it amen so I'm going to
[1:19:09] preach gross I'm going to preach it
[1:19:11] right there because he himself did now
[1:19:14] watch so whenever the new birth and
[1:19:17] reality comes to us now he says we put
[1:19:20] the blood of Jesus Christ that brings
[1:19:22] the face of Jesus Christ the virtue of
[1:19:26] Jesus Christ so it's not my faith it's
[1:19:29] not your faith it's not your virtue but
[1:19:32] if we're not careful when we read this
[1:19:35] in Peter it will be like it's something
[1:19:38] that we actually do then I have to make
[1:19:42] myself have virtue and I'm the one who
[1:19:45] does it it's not mine it's his well if
[1:19:50] it is his how can I add in the way that
[1:19:54] King James says it how can I add which
[1:19:57] we would think something exterior of of
[1:20:00] oursel and we get it we work into it
[1:20:03] whatever it is we do and we get it and
[1:20:06] we physically add it to us and we do it
[1:20:10] ourself how can I add the faith of Jesus
[1:20:14] Christ how can I add the virtue of Jesus
[1:20:17] Christ the knowledge the temperance how
[1:20:19] can I do that I cannot but if I
[1:20:22] acknowledge my need of it and I see my
[1:20:25] need I open my life before him and say
[1:20:29] Lord I need more faith how many can say
[1:20:32] that today Lord I need more faith I need
[1:20:34] more virtue I need more knowledge I need
[1:20:37] more tempers well what are you doing
[1:20:39] you're coming to the first stage of God
[1:20:41] being able to step from Faith to Virtue
[1:20:44] to knowledge to Temperance to Godliness
[1:20:46] all these virtues that God himself wants
[1:20:50] to add an us now remember he says in
[1:20:52] this that there are some of these are
[1:20:54] nature given so there are some people
[1:20:57] that by Nature they just have an element
[1:21:00] of virtue and they could just help
[1:21:02] people you seen people like that and
[1:21:04] they they didn't even have the Holy
[1:21:06] Ghost but they had a feeling for
[1:21:08] Humanity and whenever they saw people in
[1:21:11] need whatever it was all their their
[1:21:13] heart their human heart it was just so
[1:21:16] so pulled upon and they would they would
[1:21:19] Minister to them whatever it is that
[1:21:21] they had what is that nature given
[1:21:23] virtue there could be a nature given
[1:21:25] knowledge a nature given Temperance but
[1:21:28] still I don't want nature given there's
[1:21:31] some people that's just nice you know
[1:21:33] they're just nice naturally and there's
[1:21:35] others they just don't have a good
[1:21:37] makeup but God wants to make them have a
[1:21:39] good makeup now you see that person who
[1:21:42] is nice naturally it'll be very easy for
[1:21:46] them to think they've got these when in
[1:21:48] reality they don't because they were
[1:21:51] born that way but this does not come by
[1:21:54] your first verse but rather your second
[1:21:57] one so the faith of Jesus Christ The
[1:22:00] Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of
[1:22:02] Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus
[1:22:05] Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the
[1:22:08] godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly
[1:22:11] kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of
[1:22:15] God which
[1:22:18] is Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ is
[1:22:22] allowing his faith his virtue
[1:22:25] his Temperance his knowledge his
[1:22:26] godliness his brotherly kindness to flow
[1:22:29] out of us and then he himself the
[1:22:33] person caps us
[1:22:36] off the Capstone is
[1:22:39] what
[1:22:41] himself after his virtues has manifested
[1:22:45] thems in us and they will become to
[1:22:48] where you said Brother Don what are they
[1:22:50] going to do control
[1:22:52] you control you so God will allow you in
[1:22:57] negative circumstances and when your
[1:23:00] faith runs to its end then the faith of
[1:23:04] Jesus Christ will step in and help you
[1:23:06] to believe what you didn't have faith
[1:23:08] enough to believe for and maybe your
[1:23:11] virtue would run out and yet something
[1:23:15] Beyond you would automatically step in
[1:23:18] and you would start ministering virtue
[1:23:21] and strength beyond your own capability
[1:23:24] oh oh my goodness some of you is going
[1:23:25] to realize it's already been happening
[1:23:27] to your Shores the world and where did
[1:23:29] you get it at not from you so it was oh
[1:23:33] I'm going to pray more I'm going to read
[1:23:35] my Bible more that's good you do need to
[1:23:37] do that but that's not the way you're
[1:23:39] going to get more virtue you're going to
[1:23:42] get it by seeing what it is and allowing
[1:23:46] your ability to see I'm short I'm I'm
[1:23:49] short of what I need oh God lord Jesus
[1:23:52] live your virtue out of me me live your
[1:23:55] godliness out of me get your eyes off of
[1:23:59] preachers get your eyes off of ministry
[1:24:02] and so well they're going to do it all
[1:24:04] no
[1:24:07] no listen some of you Ley you may never
[1:24:11] cast out a devil in your entire
[1:24:14] life you may never Lay Your Hands on a
[1:24:17] cancer Pati and curse that cancer and
[1:24:21] watch God heal them yeah you may never
[1:24:24] ever stand in a prayer line and pray for
[1:24:27] hundreds of people and watch God heal
[1:24:30] them but there's one thing every one of
[1:24:33] you can do and must
[1:24:35] do you must let the statue of a perfect
[1:24:38] man flow out of your
[1:24:41] life remember Sister Florence Shar she
[1:24:44] went to Brother Brenham and she said
[1:24:45] brother Brenham I fasted and prayed and
[1:24:48] fasted and prayed that God would let me
[1:24:50] cast out Devils he said sister you were
[1:24:52] not called to do this
[1:24:55] but you were called to fast and pray for
[1:24:58] those who's called to do it and you say
[1:25:02] well what can I do what can I do and and
[1:25:04] some of you think in your mind well it's
[1:25:06] not really that much are you kidding
[1:25:10] me I'm talking about you
[1:25:13] becoming a
[1:25:15] habitation for almighty God and you
[1:25:18] think that's not wonderful you think
[1:25:22] that is not one of the most tremendous
[1:25:24] mendous things that could ever oh but
[1:25:26] brother doy what about sign his wonders
[1:25:28] there will be people that will walk
[1:25:30] before him that day and say I cast out
[1:25:33] devils in your name I heal the sick I've
[1:25:36] done this and that and he'll turn and
[1:25:37] say to them depart from me you worker of
[1:25:40] ini nickle I never even knew you but
[1:25:42] there won't be one son or daughter of
[1:25:45] God that will stand before him that had
[1:25:48] these virtues in their life that will
[1:25:50] ever be turned away it's totally
[1:25:53] impossible
[1:25:56] Oh my he is the head that controls you
[1:26:01] your feet is the foundation face amen
[1:26:05] controll by the head you see it takes
[1:26:08] the people there you are there is the
[1:26:11] perfect man of
[1:26:15] God when he possesses Miracles when he
[1:26:19] possesses gifts shouting running oh I
[1:26:22] believe in all that don't you I love
[1:26:24] doing it when it comes here's the
[1:26:27] perfect man of
[1:26:28] God the one who
[1:26:32] possesses these
[1:26:35] virtues God represents his church as a
[1:26:38] bride and the way he brings each
[1:26:42] individual to bring his son to go in
[1:26:45] that bride he's also brought the bride
[1:26:48] through these ages till he brings one
[1:26:52] complete Church into this now remember
[1:26:55] this is the the pyramid the stature of a
[1:26:58] perfect man my feet moves why because my
[1:27:02] head says so now it can't move like my
[1:27:06] hand because it's my feet lucer can't do
[1:27:09] the things that we did neither can the
[1:27:11] Methodist because they were something
[1:27:15] else see the feet moves because the head
[1:27:18] says so and the head never says now feet
[1:27:22] you become hands
[1:27:24] watch the spirit of God will never lead
[1:27:26] you and I into a place that we're not
[1:27:30] called and qualified to do that's the
[1:27:32] spirit of God will always lead you into
[1:27:36] your position and that is he will
[1:27:39] magnify the presence of God in your
[1:27:42] being to help you fulfill what you were
[1:27:45] called to be and don't you accept this
[1:27:48] today friends is something that's not
[1:27:50] very great I'm talking about something
[1:27:52] that the smallest portion of humanity
[1:27:55] that you can ever imagine will ever be
[1:27:57] able to attain to what you're hearing
[1:28:01] today and you think you're not doing
[1:28:03] much you think you're not called for
[1:28:06] much you're less than one in a million I
[1:28:09] guarantee you that for God to be able to
[1:28:12] manifest himself in this now once he
[1:28:15] said this being when it's completed is
[1:28:19] the Church of God
[1:28:21] going to the rapture
[1:28:24] and this being when
[1:28:27] completed is a servant of God in the
[1:28:30] Church of God that's going in the
[1:28:35] Rapture so his
[1:28:38] Focus oh my is building a house for God
[1:28:44] the being the individuals that come to
[1:28:47] this PO our bride
[1:28:51] material Rapture Ready
[1:28:55] amen word fed spirit
[1:28:58] filled so when you're surrendering
[1:29:01] notice now he doesn't put past
[1:29:04] tense that you surrendered one time as
[1:29:08] each one of these virtues becomes a
[1:29:11] stepping stone for the other you are
[1:29:14] actually giving more of
[1:29:17] yourself
[1:29:20] away the first stepping stone being face
[1:29:24] but that is altogether different than
[1:29:26] virtue so you surrender that element of
[1:29:29] yourself that tries to diagnose
[1:29:32] everything and try to figure it out from
[1:29:34] your mind and and make sense of it all
[1:29:37] oh you let that go and you let Faith his
[1:29:40] faith come in and it displaces all your
[1:29:43] intellect if it goes contrary to the
[1:29:45] word and then it gives you the energia
[1:29:49] which is the Greek word to be able to
[1:29:51] strengthen you as now okay you're doing
[1:29:54] doing good on faith now God wants you to
[1:29:55] take the next step all right so now here
[1:29:58] you are you moved up onto this step of
[1:30:01] virtue which is still very small very
[1:30:04] very tiny and you may not even know that
[1:30:06] it's there yet but God will arase
[1:30:08] opportunities by which you're able to
[1:30:11] minister virtue sometimes it might be in
[1:30:14] word form sometimes it might be by
[1:30:16] cooking a meal for somebody sometimes it
[1:30:18] might be by coming in and just putting
[1:30:20] your arm around them and praying for
[1:30:22] them brother sister I know you're
[1:30:24] through such a hard time I love you so
[1:30:26] much and just want you to know I'm
[1:30:27] standing with you and you don't even
[1:30:29] realize but from your being just left
[1:30:34] some of the strengths of Jesus Christ
[1:30:38] now I know it's hard for you to
[1:30:39] understand it I've told you about it
[1:30:40] before but whenever you're having a
[1:30:42] prayer line I know some of you have
[1:30:43] looked at me it's like what in the world
[1:30:45] you know you pray for four or five
[1:30:46] people and all of a sudden one comes
[1:30:48] soon it's they just knock your lights
[1:30:50] out and there'll be other times you'll
[1:30:53] pray for you know just all kinds of
[1:30:55] people and never do it you know and all
[1:30:57] you are is like a channel like this
[1:31:00] microphone this microphone could have
[1:31:02] wound up in a rock and roll concert it
[1:31:04] could have wound up in a symphony and be
[1:31:07] be used for whatever more the microphone
[1:31:09] ain't nothing but it's what the person
[1:31:12] that gets it and the words that are
[1:31:14] coming forth of this microphone demons
[1:31:16] have been cast out through this piece of
[1:31:19] metal right here Devils have been made
[1:31:21] to leave the children of God through
[1:31:24] this microphone this microphone itself
[1:31:26] it has no power it has no ability no
[1:31:29] more than I do but what are we were
[1:31:32] channels by which the supernatural God
[1:31:35] can manifest himself and one person come
[1:31:38] through happened you know a month and a
[1:31:40] half two months ago praying for someone
[1:31:42] in the church right there they walked up
[1:31:44] I laid my hands on them and started
[1:31:46] praying for them it's like they reached
[1:31:49] inside of my body and pulled every bit
[1:31:53] of the strength that I had out I wasn't
[1:31:55] even sure that I could even stand up as
[1:31:57] a matter of fact I fell sideways and
[1:32:00] some of the brothers see me car asked me
[1:32:02] sure she said Donnie what in the world
[1:32:04] happened I said I don't know I don't
[1:32:05] know I was doing great I was feeling
[1:32:07] good I was feeling fine and I said all
[1:32:09] of a sudden when that one person come up
[1:32:11] it's just right they reached in and pull
[1:32:14] that strength out of you oh but I'm glad
[1:32:16] there's strength there but you see God
[1:32:18] don't just want don't say oh brother
[1:32:20] Donnie ministers to the people no no
[1:32:24] don't think that oh well brother Donnie
[1:32:25] does brother Daryl does the ministers do
[1:32:28] God wants each of you Holy Ghost filled
[1:32:31] Christians God don't want me ministering
[1:32:34] to everybody God Wants You In Your
[1:32:37] Capacity whether by words as I said or
[1:32:41] by Deeds or you get up 3:00 in the
[1:32:44] morning you got a burden for brother
[1:32:45] Daryl or you got a burden for some
[1:32:47] Minister whoever it is and you're
[1:32:49] praying and praying and you get done and
[1:32:52] it feels like yours weak is a dish rag
[1:32:54] is we saying you say what in the world
[1:32:57] happened you broke into a realm with God
[1:33:01] and God took your fervency God took your
[1:33:04] faith and you gave your strengths in
[1:33:08] that moment of time to be able to
[1:33:10] minister prayer for someone in need oh
[1:33:13] tell what we want
[1:33:15] Saints notice this now he said this is
[1:33:18] the people that's going under Rapture so
[1:33:21] when you're surrendering
[1:33:24] your complete being then the Holy Spirit
[1:33:28] just pours through
[1:33:31] you in
[1:33:33] these
[1:33:36] virtues praise the
[1:33:40] Lord so every one of these wireless
[1:33:44] microphones that we
[1:33:45] have have to be set on a different
[1:33:49] frequency if not they will override one
[1:33:53] another they can produce static every
[1:33:56] one of these that you see are on a
[1:33:58] different frequency now whenever we
[1:34:00] order them we order them years ago and
[1:34:02] I'd order them I would order them on one
[1:34:04] frequency and get another and get
[1:34:05] another and try to keep up with all the
[1:34:07] different bands of it but now they've
[1:34:09] got them to where they're multiple bands
[1:34:12] and we can go in and select the
[1:34:14] frequency because sometimes the lights
[1:34:17] or maybe an amplifier or some type of
[1:34:20] electrical something will interfere with
[1:34:23] that frequency and I would get up to
[1:34:25] talk and there would be something in
[1:34:27] there and it wasn't a gargle in my
[1:34:29] throat it was something from the
[1:34:31] frequency but it doesn't mean the mic
[1:34:34] isn't working and it doesn't mean the
[1:34:37] batteries are dead and it doesn't mean
[1:34:39] it's not hooked up to the board back
[1:34:41] there but it simply means something got
[1:34:44] in the channel of the frequency and many
[1:34:47] of you are looking and think Lord do I
[1:34:48] have the Holy Ghost I don't know if I've
[1:34:50] got it or not oh no no it's not
[1:34:52] necessary that some of you do have the
[1:34:54] Holy Ghost you've just got too many
[1:34:56] things in the ways of your frequency oh
[1:35:00] my that's why the prophet tells us it's
[1:35:01] the father trying to make himself known
[1:35:04] to you but you let too many things in
[1:35:07] life get in the way now you see this is
[1:35:10] what God is Desiring for a bride and
[1:35:12] friends we're not just talking about us
[1:35:15] as our local assembly we're talking
[1:35:17] about God doing the same thing all over
[1:35:20] the entire Earth at the same time and at
[1:35:23] the same time when we come to this spot
[1:35:26] and we are kept off then God will call
[1:35:31] for the
[1:35:33] resurrection do you realize how
[1:35:36] imperative that this is there will be no
[1:35:43] Resurrection if God does not produce
[1:35:45] this in a body around the world
[1:35:51] right is anybody worried about it this
[1:35:54] morning you worried about it brother
[1:35:55] Philip what about brother Matthew you
[1:35:57] worried about that God ain't going to do
[1:35:58] it we get all uptight I ain't a bit more
[1:36:00] worried than a man in the moon my God
[1:36:02] said it my God will produce it oh but
[1:36:05] brother Donnie me that yeah me you I
[1:36:07] understand me you I ain't looking at me
[1:36:09] and you I ain't looking at our faults
[1:36:11] and our shortcomings I ain't looking at
[1:36:13] your temper I ain't looking at your lack
[1:36:15] of Brotherly kindness I'm looking at the
[1:36:16] promise of his word and his word says
[1:36:19] he's going to do it the word tells us
[1:36:21] through the message of the hour that
[1:36:23] there's going to be a people that's
[1:36:24] going to possess these things and I say
[1:36:27] Amen well I'm a long way from it well
[1:36:29] you may be but you ain't going to be
[1:36:31] because you're going to come to the
[1:36:33] promise of what God Said Hallelujah and
[1:36:36] if I got to get this measuring tape out
[1:36:38] every night for the next 57 years and
[1:36:40] preach on it every day and three times a
[1:36:42] week and start a 7-Day Revival once
[1:36:44] every three or four months we are going
[1:36:46] to arrive at this spot by the grace of
[1:36:49] God because God will not fail this word
[1:36:53] our Saints are waiting on us Paul is
[1:36:56] waiting on us Peter the man who wrote
[1:36:59] this in the Bible is waiting on
[1:37:02] [Applause]
[1:37:07] us when the Holy Spirit just pours
[1:37:11] through
[1:37:13] you oh Lord
[1:37:17] God maybe for those of you that have
[1:37:20] never
[1:37:21] experienced God using you you
[1:37:25] to pray over a person and then be healed
[1:37:28] some of them visibly right there in your
[1:37:31] eyes others Maybe by process of Divine
[1:37:34] Healing it's hard to explain what that
[1:37:36] does see and I've had God to do that for
[1:37:38] me brother John you other minister
[1:37:40] brother Joel Brown all you other
[1:37:42] brothers here whenever you you just know
[1:37:44] beyond a Shad of a doubt that work is
[1:37:47] done I mean it's so awesome whenever you
[1:37:51] stand there in that presence and you
[1:37:53] realize what God just did through your
[1:37:57] Humanity dust mere dust and you laid
[1:38:02] these dust fingers and dust muscles and
[1:38:05] dust Bones on a human body and God used
[1:38:08] your dust Mouse and you curse that
[1:38:12] demon and that demon
[1:38:16] leave it's so
[1:38:22] wonderful but I've seen some of them
[1:38:24] same people that that happened to get
[1:38:27] sick
[1:38:31] again so we're pointing to a
[1:38:34] direction in these virtues that are
[1:38:39] irreversible so a person can get their
[1:38:42] healing and lose
[1:38:44] it but Peter goes on to say about this
[1:38:47] if these things be in you you shall
[1:38:50] never fall you'll never fall short of
[1:38:54] the glory of God oh my goodness friends
[1:38:56] think how much greater in that sense to
[1:38:59] achieve these in our life
[1:39:04] sir then you're a living
[1:39:07] Tabernacle then people look out and say
[1:39:11] there's a man full of
[1:39:13] virtue knowledge believes the word
[1:39:18] Temperance patient godliness God
[1:39:21] brotherly kindness full of the love of
[1:39:23] the Holy Ghost walking around what is it
[1:39:26] a stature that unbelievers can look at
[1:39:29] and say
[1:39:31] there is a
[1:39:35] Christian now this is common terms to us
[1:39:39] Christian we say it so much and we hear
[1:39:42] it on
[1:39:43] signs we see it everywhere Christian
[1:39:46] Christian Christian Christian you work
[1:39:47] with people that say they are Christians
[1:39:49] and they're
[1:39:50] devils and because it's so called to us
[1:39:55] it's not the value of it but whenever a
[1:39:57] person can say
[1:39:59] this about a real one there's
[1:40:04] nothing they could say any
[1:40:08] greater if you were a millionaire or a
[1:40:11] billionaire or a trillionaire if there
[1:40:13] was such a thing as that oh my oh my
[1:40:16] he's a billionaire you're might blow out
[1:40:17] your chest and say oh wow they're
[1:40:19] talking about me they're talking about
[1:40:21] me but depend depends on which way the
[1:40:24] stock market goes and what else Trump
[1:40:26] shuts down and whatever Doge does this
[1:40:28] and that and the other you may be rich
[1:40:30] today who knows what you going to be
[1:40:32] tomorrow but if you ever get this right
[1:40:34] here for 10,000 times 10,000 of years
[1:40:38] you'll still be going down the streets
[1:40:40] of Glory saying praise be to God every
[1:40:43] time you walk out that City and turn
[1:40:46] around and come back in you will see
[1:40:49] your own image and the reflection of the
[1:40:52] house you live in when you walk outside
[1:40:56] them City Gates and turn right back
[1:40:58] around and God sent you over to
[1:41:00] Afghanistan or aler or wherever he sends
[1:41:02] you on the king's business amen and you
[1:41:05] turn right around and come back into
[1:41:07] that City and there's the 12 foundation
[1:41:09] and there's that Great Pyramid City you
[1:41:11] know what you'll see you'll see your own
[1:41:13] life you'll see the grace of God because
[1:41:16] you're going to live in the same oh
[1:41:19] Hallelujah geometric design that God
[1:41:22] designed in your soul oh you say but how
[1:41:25] much perfect love do I need he'll give
[1:41:28] you just exactly the measure that you
[1:41:30] need for the glory of God oh my the
[1:41:33] thing of it is just let it start flowing
[1:41:36] yes
[1:41:38] sir my there is a man or a woman who
[1:41:42] knows what they're talking about you
[1:41:45] never seen a
[1:41:47] Kinder
[1:41:50] sweeter godlier person
[1:41:53] you're sealed and the seal shows on both
[1:41:59] sides whether you're going or
[1:42:02] coming they'll see the seal just the
[1:42:05] same there you are what a man or
[1:42:08] woman possess
[1:42:10] this then the Capstone comes
[1:42:15] down and seals them into the kingdom of
[1:42:19] God which is the Holy Ghost
[1:42:23] and remember the Dynamics of this church
[1:42:27] will be the Capstone again which we've
[1:42:29] had in part while The Headstone has been
[1:42:33] descending a
[1:42:36] refilling I'm glad there's refilling
[1:42:38] aren't
[1:42:40] you now look the spirit of God is going
[1:42:43] to seal
[1:42:45] us into the economy of God thank you
[1:42:50] Lord
[1:42:51] Jesus watch this then the word coming
[1:42:54] from here manifest itself through each
[1:42:58] of these
[1:43:01] beings and makes it complete being a
[1:43:04] tabernacle of the Living God a walking
[1:43:07] living
[1:43:08] example of
[1:43:10] Christianity what Christ was these
[1:43:14] people are because his life is in here
[1:43:19] they are in Christ and their life is
[1:43:21] dead and hid in Christ to God sealed in
[1:43:24] there Glory by the Holy Ghost 1
[1:43:26] Corinthians 12 you reckon yourself dead
[1:43:30] then you're born of Faith then virtue
[1:43:33] and all these other things has added to
[1:43:36] you to you're a perfect living
[1:43:41] image of
[1:43:45] God thank you Lord you you don't want to
[1:43:48] be a replica of
[1:43:50] me I don't want to be a Rec of of
[1:43:53] brother Tim PR I love him me my brother
[1:43:55] with all my heart brother Ron Spencer
[1:43:57] many of these preacher brothers friends
[1:43:59] of mine all around the world I don't
[1:44:01] want to be a replica of brother Daryl I
[1:44:04] love brother darl I appreciate him but I
[1:44:06] would be settling for so much less than
[1:44:09] what God wants me to be me brother Daryl
[1:44:12] striving for the same image I don't want
[1:44:14] to be like brother darl brother darl
[1:44:15] don't want to be like me but we both
[1:44:17] want to be like
[1:44:18] Jesus and that's exactly the same thing
[1:44:21] that every one of you l
[1:44:23] ity we all stand on the same
[1:44:27] Plateau when it comes to this no doubt
[1:44:31] no doubt I will minister to Mo in virtue
[1:44:33] and brother Daryl and some of these
[1:44:35] other brothers but you can have your own
[1:44:38] dose of
[1:44:42] virtue isn't that wonderful then God
[1:44:45] through that has brought also seven
[1:44:48] Church agents to show the seven steps
[1:44:52] that he brought this building his
[1:44:54] individual Into His Image that's built a
[1:44:57] complete
[1:44:58] Church in His image at the resurrection
[1:45:02] this complete body will be raised up to
[1:45:06] live with him
[1:45:09] forever because it's a
[1:45:11] bride so that cuts in every
[1:45:16] age every
[1:45:19] age so there's things who could say
[1:45:21] about Paul's age who could to say about
[1:45:23] the second age and the third age and the
[1:45:26] fourth age so brother Donnie if I get
[1:45:29] saved and I start out being born again
[1:45:31] and I get Faith and that's everything I
[1:45:33] need faith will lead to Virtue because
[1:45:36] your faith alone needs the accompaniment
[1:45:40] of virtue to help you keep from being
[1:45:44] selfish the rest of your Christian Life
[1:45:47] and using your face for
[1:45:50] yourself sir thank we are a body as your
[1:45:55] virtues need each other to compliment
[1:45:59] you so do we need each other in the body
[1:46:04] thank God for pastors amen thank God for
[1:46:07] evangelists too is that right thank God
[1:46:10] for other aspects of the ministry we
[1:46:12] thank God for every one of them but
[1:46:14] where would we be today had God not sent
[1:46:16] a prophit in this age with some message
[1:46:19] don't we thank God for that as well
[1:46:21] thank God for pastors but what's real
[1:46:23] true pastors of the end time preaching
[1:46:25] the message of the hour brought by a
[1:46:27] Vindicated Prophet so the prophet would
[1:46:29] bring it in a certain way a pastor would
[1:46:32] bring it in another way you know an
[1:46:33] evangelist would bring it in another way
[1:46:35] but if they're all B with the spirit of
[1:46:37] God they're saying the exact same
[1:46:39] thing now watch he said so you get it
[1:46:43] these people who died in
[1:46:46] here millions of
[1:46:48] them they died under the virtue of faith
[1:46:53] in the first church
[1:46:55] age and then virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:47:00] godliness all these
[1:47:02] things but it wasn't like they was
[1:47:05] complete within thems did they have the
[1:47:09] spirit of God in each one yes how many
[1:47:12] knows L Luther had a portion of the
[1:47:13] spirit of
[1:47:15] God but he drank
[1:47:19] beer smoked a pipe well he said glory to
[1:47:23] God I can no you can't you're living in
[1:47:25] a different age you can't drink nothing
[1:47:28] stronger than
[1:47:30] Pepsi come on well glory to God lucier
[1:47:34] made it that was his age that was where
[1:47:37] he was at but as we climb up the pyramid
[1:47:40] it's getting smaller and smaller and
[1:47:43] smaller and smaller look Faith may not
[1:47:46] be in comparative size to what the
[1:47:50] Capstone will be and you're looking for
[1:47:53] bigger bigger bigger we're going the
[1:47:55] wrong way on the pyramid we've got it
[1:47:56] upside down Lance we've got it started
[1:47:59] off with a pinpoint at the bottom and
[1:48:01] we're trying to build it this way well
[1:48:03] there's going to be more of us more of
[1:48:05] us we're going to do this this this this
[1:48:07] we're going the wrong direction brother
[1:48:08] Jack the big wide Foundation is at the
[1:48:11] bottom as it comes up it's getting less
[1:48:13] and less and less and less oh my and
[1:48:16] you're looking glory to God when I get
[1:48:18] perfect love I'll be doing these great
[1:48:20] big things keep in mind the proportion
[1:48:23] of the building of God Divine perfect
[1:48:26] love may manifest itself out of you to
[1:48:29] 20 people and you will have
[1:48:33] achieved your
[1:48:35] portion in the body
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:41] amen don't think everybody out here is
[1:48:43] going to know you're a son and daughter
[1:48:45] of
[1:48:46] God they never
[1:48:49] will but what you want to influence it
[1:48:52] goes that God has put in your paths yes
[1:48:56] sir let me
[1:49:00] close listen to how this whole
[1:49:03] thing these people died in you're
[1:49:06] depending the whole body
[1:49:08] now and waiting on
[1:49:11] us so this
[1:49:14] church has got to come to
[1:49:18] perfection in order to
[1:49:21] bring the
[1:49:24] resurrection Word of
[1:49:27] Life
[1:49:30] listen to your challenge
[1:49:35] today it's not to get more
[1:49:37] members sure Shine Your Light we want
[1:49:41] everybody in here that God wants there's
[1:49:42] more out here that needs to be brought
[1:49:44] in Shine Your Light witness to them
[1:49:47] we'll baptize him we'll do everything we
[1:49:49] can do to reach him for the Lord right
[1:49:52] Miracle signs wonders yes we believe in
[1:49:55] that but I don't want our church to turn
[1:49:58] into being known as a miracle church and
[1:50:00] a sign church and that's the only reason
[1:50:01] people
[1:50:03] come healing is the children's
[1:50:06] bread we need Miracles Our God does
[1:50:10] Miracles I don't want us to be known
[1:50:12] just as a miracle sign church we want to
[1:50:15] be known as a full born Word Church what
[1:50:18] we believe in miracles we believe in
[1:50:20] signs but we also believe in brother ly
[1:50:23] kindness and I've done found it out a
[1:50:25] long time ago sometimes signs and
[1:50:27] miracles are a whole lot easier to
[1:50:28] achieve than brotherly kindness
[1:50:30] is
[1:50:33] amen so notice in order to bring the
[1:50:36] resurrection God building building
[1:50:39] honing building honing building coming
[1:50:42] up to this finale they're they're under
[1:50:45] Souls under the alt waiting for this
[1:50:49] church my daughter is waiting on me
[1:50:54] brother Jimmy is waiting on us sister
[1:50:56] Linda brother Calvin's waiting on us
[1:51:00] brother Daniel
[1:51:01] Nunley brother Jean Leman brother Jean
[1:51:04] Litteton on and on and on we could go
[1:51:07] all those Saints they're
[1:51:10] waiting oh it Ain like they're sad where
[1:51:12] they
[1:51:13] are but they're in a temporary
[1:51:16] State they have no
[1:51:20] flesh they do not have a human body in
[1:51:23] the sense that we
[1:51:26] do they're longing they're Desiring
[1:51:29] they're happy
[1:51:30] yes but they're
[1:51:33] waiting they're
[1:51:35] waiting Lord
[1:51:39] God waiting for this church to come to
[1:51:42] its Perfection but when Christ does come
[1:51:45] and this church you see is getting
[1:51:47] smaller in the minority it's a whole lot
[1:51:50] sharper than that but just so write that
[1:51:53] across there it's come up to a needle
[1:52:00] point a
[1:52:02] needle
[1:52:05] point do you understand whenever he
[1:52:07] brings
[1:52:09] her to this last stage right before the
[1:52:12] headstone sits down on her which is
[1:52:15] rapturing
[1:52:16] Faith this is our Capstone that we're
[1:52:19] waiting
[1:52:19] on rapturing faith
[1:52:24] it will be honed and honed and honed
[1:52:26] hated people will come and leave come
[1:52:28] and go smaller smaller smaller smaller
[1:52:31] until it comes in The Headstone we just
[1:52:34] sit right down on the top of
[1:52:40] it and the world will never hear
[1:52:44] the but what is that him kissing the
[1:52:47] church oh
[1:52:50] my and they're waiting for Pride Revival
[1:52:53] that's going to shake the world we're
[1:52:55] going to go to the hospitals and empty
[1:52:56] them out Jesus never even done
[1:53:01] that I believe great times are ling in
[1:53:04] front of us if we'll get our priorities
[1:53:05] right the prophet said he believed that
[1:53:07] there'd be missing limbs that would be
[1:53:09] restored I believe the same thing but he
[1:53:12] ain't going to do it so people will come
[1:53:14] and follow us because the signs that's
[1:53:16] not what we
[1:53:17] want I've seen what that produces it
[1:53:20] produces many times puffed up men
[1:53:23] and they think they're so much greater
[1:53:25] than everybody else well how can one
[1:53:27] clot of dust brag to another clot of
[1:53:30] dust I'm a bigger claw than you are I'm
[1:53:33] a more a bit more Dusty than you are
[1:53:35] well well well you old red Alabama poo
[1:53:38] dirt you and you think because you're
[1:53:40] red you go sweet taters better than
[1:53:42] black Louisiana Dirt does you're still
[1:53:44] dirt dirt bag well Hallelujah it's only
[1:53:48] the grace of God that's why we need
[1:53:50] these virtues that's why we need him so
[1:53:53] when we run into our brothers and sister
[1:53:55] that we disagree with on theology that
[1:53:59] Jesus Christ brotherly kindness will
[1:54:02] treat them the way he treats
[1:54:08] us now listen what it's going to come to
[1:54:12] the church and the minority has got to
[1:54:14] get into a place until it's the same
[1:54:17] kind of
[1:54:19] ministry that this left
[1:54:23] so Jesus started it off at the bottom
[1:54:26] with his
[1:54:28] ministry and whenever he comes back
[1:54:31] right up here at the
[1:54:32] top it'll be the same Ministry that
[1:54:36] started off at the
[1:54:38] bottom so it won't be a nickan thing it
[1:54:42] won't be a hierarchy of
[1:54:44] clergy praise the Lord but it will be a
[1:54:48] Ministry because when this headstone
[1:54:51] comes back it's got a pocket listen a
[1:54:56] pocket like here which's going to sit
[1:54:59] right there in the regular pyramid it
[1:55:01] isn't just a
[1:55:03] cap that sets across the top it's a
[1:55:07] little
[1:55:11] flange and it's got to sit there cuz it
[1:55:16] sheds the
[1:55:19] water so there's a little flange
[1:55:22] and whenever it comes down it locks all
[1:55:25] the sides and sets it and
[1:55:28] sheds the
[1:55:30] water and when it comes this church has
[1:55:33] got to be so honed all the rest of these
[1:55:36] stones in the pyramid laying so perfect
[1:55:40] till you can't run a razor
[1:55:43] blade between
[1:55:47] them how many's been to the pyramids of
[1:55:50] Egypt anybody with the tong
[1:55:53] sister Leman Carol
[1:55:55] myself it's absolutely
[1:55:58] phenomenal not only in Egypt but when we
[1:56:02] were in Israel and finding them stones
[1:56:05] and one particular Stone there that we
[1:56:07] saw longer than from this back wall to
[1:56:11] that back wall back
[1:56:13] there hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[1:56:17] of
[1:56:19] tons and they still don't know how they
[1:56:21] made them
[1:56:23] and they even cut a diagram in that
[1:56:25] solid stone that looked like an
[1:56:27] elongated Roman
[1:56:29] ogi I have a hard enough time doing that
[1:56:31] with Hickory or black
[1:56:34] walnut and they cut that thing and I
[1:56:36] stood there with my eye brother skipped
[1:56:38] and looked at that that cut down to
[1:56:40] their perfect
[1:56:42] perfect boy what an achievement that was
[1:56:45] to cutting
[1:56:47] Rock but this is even a greater
[1:56:49] achievement to cut into hard-headed skin
[1:56:52] oh you're a greater achievement than
[1:56:55] than Pharaoh Pharaoh can say hell boys
[1:56:57] build my pyramid said well what about
[1:56:59] Lance I forget Lance can't do nothing
[1:57:01] that old boy forget Jonathan can't do
[1:57:03] nothing forget Dave Swanson he's too
[1:57:04] much of a European you know he's got
[1:57:06] this in him and that and forget Donnie
[1:57:07] Reagan Lord have mercy hard-headed
[1:57:09] stubborn oh you don't want to preach for
[1:57:11] me don't want to do this that other and
[1:57:12] God said what you call trash what you
[1:57:16] call
[1:57:18] impossible I will cut and shape
[1:57:23] and every
[1:57:25] stone will be mortared together so
[1:57:33] tightly when brother Dave and I laid
[1:57:35] this Stone right
[1:57:36] here and we had these lifts up in
[1:57:39] there we had them Stone L all around us
[1:57:43] upon the rails
[1:57:45] everywhere he had somebody down there
[1:57:47] beneath him I had somebody down there
[1:57:49] beneath me I'd measure the hole
[1:57:52] throw me a 3 by five throw me a 3 by six
[1:57:57] throw me a two by
[1:57:59] whatever and sometimes they'd throw it
[1:58:01] up and I'd catch it and I'd put it in
[1:58:03] there it's too
[1:58:05] big too big on this end they take a side
[1:58:08] cutter with a diamond bit and they knock
[1:58:11] a little of it
[1:58:12] off and then they if it needed to be if
[1:58:15] it's too long they would just cut it
[1:58:18] these stones are made whether or not
[1:58:20] solid color all the way through color is
[1:58:22] only so deep so when you cut it what you
[1:58:25] see is little tiny Pebbles on the inside
[1:58:28] so then the brothers would cut it and
[1:58:31] then they'd take a chisel or a small
[1:58:33] hammer and they'd Nick the ends of it so
[1:58:37] it would look like that it was molded to
[1:58:40] fit that certain spot God ain't just
[1:58:43] whacking and cutting and so well
[1:58:45] whatever works I don't care just throw
[1:58:47] it all together we'll use bubble gum to
[1:58:50] hold it together
[1:58:52] we're talking about a house of God that
[1:58:55] will live through
[1:58:58] eternity think of it sights of God when
[1:59:00] you leave this world in a Rapture you
[1:59:04] will be fit for
[1:59:10] eternity your character will be so
[1:59:15] molded through
[1:59:17] eternity you will be there in the great
[1:59:20] Paradise of God
[1:59:22] and when there is no more devil you
[1:59:25] still will be when there is no more time
[1:59:28] when there is no more
[1:59:33] sickness so God picks you up sometimes
[1:59:35] brother philli and hands the preacher
[1:59:37] the Mallet whack whack
[1:59:41] whack I got a text from one of the
[1:59:43] brothers of their church he said boy the
[1:59:44] Lord sure has been making a hard on me
[1:59:46] in the last few
[1:59:48] Services joined the crowd
[1:59:52] man alive a lot of us start out as a
[1:59:54] gigantic Boulder we weigh
[1:59:57] 385,000 lb we're 21 feet long four feet
[2:00:01] thick six feet tall and when God gets
[2:00:04] done with
[2:00:08] us you're the size of Kit candy all
[2:00:11] remember what the little kit candy was
[2:00:13] and you're glory to God lord you want me
[2:00:16] to fill up the whole wall he said no I
[2:00:19] had something about like this in mind
[2:00:23] now Lord God don't tell me you're going
[2:00:25] to put me underneath somebody don't tell
[2:00:27] me you're going to put me on the bottom
[2:00:28] now Lord I'm much better than
[2:00:31] that can't you see why we need more of
[2:00:34] these things in our
[2:00:44] lives and up here when the pyramid cap
[2:00:47] does come the pyramid itself the body of
[2:00:50] Christ will have to be
[2:00:53] honed the children I know cutting don't
[2:00:57] you know we don't like it but y ought to
[2:00:59] be so grateful to God that you've got a
[2:01:01] church that you can go to that's a
[2:01:03] honing
[2:01:07] Church a lot of folks in the Tri Cities
[2:01:09] ain't looking for a honing Church they
[2:01:12] looking for a bragging Church oh y'all
[2:01:13] are so good and y'all are so wonderful
[2:01:15] now don't worry about trying to be
[2:01:17] perfect and don't worry about all that
[2:01:18] stuff the Lord understands y'all can't
[2:01:20] overcome lust the Lord Lord understands
[2:01:22] some of you men want to become women and
[2:01:24] you know we we accept you here at the at
[2:01:26] our church well I do that's because of
[2:01:27] the kind of spirit that they're in there
[2:01:29] but in our church we want preachers that
[2:01:32] come through even visiting ones that
[2:01:34] have honing
[2:01:38] tools Lord if I need cutting cut me if I
[2:01:41] need chipping chip
[2:01:45] me I'd much rather be cut now than
[2:01:49] thrown into the
[2:01:50] furnace and be
[2:01:54] destroyed listen this quote I love this
[2:01:57] when the pyramid cap does come the
[2:01:59] pyramid itself the body of Christ will
[2:02:02] have to be H not only just some Creed or
[2:02:04] doctrine or something we've come
[2:02:07] through it'll have to be so perfectly
[2:02:10] like
[2:02:11] Christ till when he comes he and that
[2:02:19] Ministry so where do you figure then the
[2:02:21] people around the message that don't
[2:02:22] even believe in Ministry where they're
[2:02:25] going to fit when the Capstone
[2:02:30] comes what will it be the true Ministry
[2:02:33] of God will so match The Headstone he
[2:02:36] and the
[2:02:37] ministry will unite together what will
[2:02:41] it produce Believers that's what
[2:02:43] Ministry is
[2:02:45] for so perfectly like Christ that when
[2:02:47] he comes here in the ministry will fit
[2:02:50] right smack
[2:02:52] don't you love those theological
[2:02:55] terms write
[2:02:57] smack together
[2:03:00] then will come the
[2:03:03] Rapture the going
[2:03:07] home that's what I live for every day of
[2:03:10] my
[2:03:13] life how many wants to be ready for that
[2:03:19] hour can you see a lack in your walk
[2:03:21] walk can you see where you need to move
[2:03:24] up I certainly can but don't be
[2:03:27] discouraged now just take the tape and
[2:03:31] keep going but what you need to be in
[2:03:35] order to leave this world
[2:03:38] ready so much at his image that he would
[2:03:42] be able to say to you come away my
[2:03:46] love he will not say Come Away my flawed
[2:03:50] deficient Poor Pitiful bride that barely
[2:03:53] held on from day to
[2:03:56] day we are his
[2:04:01] victory praise the
[2:04:03] Lord let's B us
[2:04:10] together heavenly father
[2:04:12] I pray that you'd take this today Lord
[2:04:16] and make it real to each of our hearts
[2:04:18] begin with me my Lord
[2:04:22] I desire to see more of these things in
[2:04:25] my
[2:04:26] life I see them already
[2:04:29] father I believe I've received the true
[2:04:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:34] but I'm longing to come to that spot to
[2:04:38] where my life will add to all the rest
[2:04:41] of those lives around the world that
[2:04:44] will be able to call the
[2:04:46] dead Out of the Dust of the Earth
[2:04:51] we can pray for the sick and they can
[2:04:53] get healed and we can pray for the
[2:04:55] discouraged and they can become
[2:04:56] encouraged we we we see that happening
[2:04:58] among us but it's evident we're not yet
[2:05:01] not yet quite where we need to
[2:05:04] be because the dead have not raised
[2:05:10] yet so our crowning then is not going to
[2:05:12] be a Pentecostal
[2:05:15] explosion our crowning is not just going
[2:05:18] to be all of a sudden there will be such
[2:05:20] wonders and signs and Miracles and
[2:05:22] everybody will stop flocking to us
[2:05:24] no it's getting smaller as it goes to
[2:05:27] the top not
[2:05:29] bigger but whenever we arrive each of
[2:05:33] us Lord God I don't care if a lay person
[2:05:36] beats me to the top
[2:05:38] first Lord if it's one of these sisters
[2:05:40] so be it if it's one of these brothers
[2:05:43] so be it so the virtues of God are
[2:05:46] flowing out of them and you're daily
[2:05:49] living through their life and one one
[2:05:51] day they might have a greater need of
[2:05:53] Faith the next day they might have a
[2:05:55] greater need of virtue and the next it
[2:05:57] might be Temperance and the next it
[2:05:59] might be T knowledge whatever it is Lord
[2:06:03] we just want to live every day so when
[2:06:06] the circumstance would
[2:06:08] arise we have all that we
[2:06:11] need and we will not be short in any way
[2:06:15] there may be days we need so much
[2:06:17] brotherly
[2:06:19] kindness as we looked at it Wednesday
[2:06:21] night was Peter in the
[2:06:23] parable and how wonderfully you express
[2:06:26] that to us Lord in
[2:06:28] Matthew and then one man ow owed over
[2:06:31] $20 and something million
[2:06:34] dollar and the other man owed
[2:06:40] $7 Lord Jesus help us
[2:06:43] father sometimes we need more help with
[2:06:45] brotherly
[2:06:46] kindness all we're Pals and buddies as
[2:06:49] long as we agree doctor and go along
[2:06:52] with this and that and the other but
[2:06:53] just to sure as a little bit of
[2:06:55] difference comes between us we go to
[2:06:58] pull and off from one
[2:07:00] another forgive us Lord it shows even
[2:07:05] among
[2:07:06] Ministry it shows we need more brotherly
[2:07:11] kindness help us father not to
[2:07:15] emphasize on minorities and minimize
[2:07:20] majorities help us father that we will
[2:07:23] never ever lay aside these precious
[2:07:26] wonderful
[2:07:28] things we love you today Jesus I thank
[2:07:32] you I do not know how many from Word of
[2:07:34] Life
[2:07:36] Church will arrive at this
[2:07:39] spot but I believe there are some here
[2:07:43] today that are well on their
[2:07:46] Journey
[2:07:49] Hallelujah and they will receive that
[2:07:52] capping that rapturing
[2:07:54] face that body
[2:07:57] change thank you Lord Jesus because you
[2:08:01] have begun that work in them and you
[2:08:04] will complete it father my desire is
[2:08:08] that I'll just be one of them
[2:08:11] Lord help me Lord Jesus now if you don't
[2:08:15] mind I'll take a few moments Lord and
[2:08:18] ask you for myself
[2:08:21] spend so much of my time praying for
[2:08:23] others and listening to tapes for
[2:08:26] others now I'd like to ask you for
[2:08:29] me I've never asked you for money I've
[2:08:32] never asked you for fame for
[2:08:35] popularity in reality there's very few
[2:08:37] things I've ever asked you for from
[2:08:40] me most of them involve around the same
[2:08:44] thought I want to be what you want me to
[2:08:49] be I don't want to fail you I don't want
[2:08:52] to fail your
[2:08:53] people help me Lord that I can bring
[2:08:56] what is needful for this
[2:08:58] season may it be Anointed with your
[2:09:02] presence help me Lord God that I'll be
[2:09:05] able to be what you desire me to
[2:09:10] be your Prophet said you had virtue
[2:09:13] compassion mercy and so on so he said if
[2:09:17] we're going to be like Jesus we've got
[2:09:19] to have it help me
[2:09:23] Lord sometimes father I have so many
[2:09:26] phone calls and so many emails from
[2:09:29] people around the world with one
[2:09:31] question and another question and Lord
[2:09:33] WhatsApp and text and sometimes oh Lord
[2:09:37] it it just about becomes overwhelming
[2:09:39] the needs of your people are so so
[2:09:43] many and Carol and I will pray we'
[2:09:46] prayed in Walmart we've prayed in Lowe's
[2:09:48] we pulled over on the side of the road
[2:09:51] cuz when your children are in need it's
[2:09:53] desperate to
[2:09:55] them help me Jesus sometimes and I feel
[2:09:58] like I can't give no more may your
[2:10:02] virtue that Unlimited
[2:10:05] Supply flow through US Lord
[2:10:08] God I don't just pray that for me today
[2:10:11] but father I pray that for these
[2:10:12] brothers and

[2:10:21] raised my kids and Lord what have I ever
[2:10:25] done Lord God help them to realize she
[2:10:28] had been given a great special Title by
[2:10:30] the prophet of God as The Fifth Gospel
[2:10:34] Matthew Mark Luke John and
[2:10:37] mother she needs virtue to them little
[2:10:39] children she's going to need virtue when
[2:10:42] her husband comes in at night and he's
[2:10:43] wore out and had a bad day and she's had
[2:10:46] a bad day and well the devil do
[2:10:48] everything in the world try to come
[2:10:49] between them but help them Lord help us
[2:10:53] to realize the kingdom that some of us
[2:10:56] may conquer it may not be too much
[2:10:59] further beyond our front door our back
[2:11:02] door and our
[2:11:05] garage but if we can do that what a say
[2:11:09] we have
[2:11:10] done help us Lord
[2:11:14] Jesus can we just raise our hands this
[2:11:18] morning while in the presence of God
[2:11:24] may God take his great measuring tape of
[2:11:27] Christ
[2:11:29] Jesus and may He begin with me
[2:11:32] today may he measure me and see where I
[2:11:36] am and where I need to
[2:11:39] be and once I see what I'm showing up on
[2:11:42] the
[2:11:43] tape then I'll know what to ask
[2:11:46] for then my petition will be Lord help
[2:11:49] me I'm falling short help help
[2:11:52] me anybody else you're willing to do the
[2:11:55] same this
[2:11:57] morning don't let your neighbor take the
[2:11:59] tape and sometimes you can't even take
[2:12:01] it yourself cuz you'll never look at
[2:12:04] yourself quite right but may the Holy
[2:12:07] Ghost take that tape and measure
[2:12:10] you well you you're good on Fai and
[2:12:13] you're good on godliness you're you're
[2:12:15] good on that oh but your virture you
[2:12:17] still run a little bit short there son
[2:12:20] your brotherly it's a little bit short I
[2:12:23] I saw you got short with that brother
[2:12:24] there the other day and you just got a
[2:12:26] real attitude toward him you need to
[2:12:29] come on up a little higher
[2:12:32] son Lord God speak to the young
[2:12:36] people speak to the middleaged speak to
[2:12:38] the elders the
[2:12:40] seniors Lord those that are Homebound
[2:12:43] and can't even come to church father be
[2:12:45] mindful of them too would you Lord
[2:12:47] they'd love to be here because of
[2:12:49] sickness or whatever they can't Lord let
[2:12:52] them know you haven't forgot about them
[2:12:55] please father minister to us today Lord
[2:12:59] Jesus we may not be the noisiest Church
[2:13:03] in the
[2:13:04] message we certainly won't be the
[2:13:06] biggest one we may not be the richest
[2:13:08] one or really we're not interested in
[2:13:10] comparing to anyone else
[2:13:12] anyway but let our identity
[2:13:15] be a church that has so much of the love
[2:13:18] of God oh yeah we believe in gifts yes
[2:13:22] sir we believe in them with all of our
[2:13:25] hearts but the prophet of God told us he
[2:13:28] would rather have that love than every
[2:13:32] spiritual gift that you
[2:13:35] have to me that is quite phenomenal
[2:13:38] especially of a man who operated in the
[2:13:40] gifts probably nearly every day of his
[2:13:43] life after he entered into
[2:13:45] Ministry but he found the key and the
[2:13:48] key is
[2:13:50] love feel the housewives
[2:13:53] Jesus feel the little kids feel the
[2:13:57] teenagers those in
[2:14:00] college Lord God the deacons they have a
[2:14:02] tough
[2:14:04] job Lord sometimes the people might get
[2:14:06] aggravated on them because they have to
[2:14:07] speak to their kids and they have to
[2:14:09] deal with this issue and that issue I
[2:14:11] thank you for our Deacon Brothers Lord I
[2:14:13] pray that you'd strengthen them yes Lord
[2:14:15] help them father I pray for the other
[2:14:18] ministry here at the church I pray for
[2:14:20] the trustees Sunday school
[2:14:22] leaders Lord God I pray father for our
[2:14:25] brothers in the library father many
[2:14:27] times the hidden ones up there in the
[2:14:30] booth they run the sound part the ones
[2:14:32] in the upper part there they run the
[2:14:34] internet so people can be able to still
[2:14:37] stream the service and they sacrifice
[2:14:40] service after service would you be
[2:14:42] mindful of them up there today Lord Lord
[2:14:45] we don't want them to come here and try
[2:14:47] to take care of everybody else and fall
[2:14:50] short of the glory of God God

[2:27:21] restrictions was these little tiny words
[2:27:25] on the bottom of this
[2:27:28] panel they had massive restrictions on
[2:27:31] our platform we had to double ply the
[2:27:33] plywood cost us thousands of
[2:27:38] dollars but we would not have a
[2:27:40] certificate of occupancy today if those
[2:27:43] little tiny things were not put on the
[2:27:46] bottom of the
[2:27:48] panels I want wonder how close we are
[2:27:52] today to full
[2:27:57] occupancy some of you may be here some
[2:27:59] of you may be there some of you may be
[2:28:01] wherever you are and some of you may be
[2:28:03] that close right there oh you need just
[2:28:07] that little tiny
[2:28:10] thing print
[2:28:12] out and it's stuck to your
[2:28:15] life and your Rapture Ready
[2:28:20] thank you Lord don't you want to
[2:28:22] know brother Don where are you exactly I
[2:28:25] don't have a
[2:28:30] clue you me well I can see all all of
[2:28:34] them in my
[2:28:35] life but I believe there's got to be
[2:28:37] more of
[2:28:41] them I just want to see more John more
[2:28:46] so am I greater in faith sometimes I
[2:28:48] feel like I'm greater in faith the name
[2:28:50] in
[2:28:51] virtue you know know how it feels like
[2:28:53] whenever you pray for people and you
[2:28:54] lose all the strength that you have and
[2:28:57] there's hundreds of more people in the
[2:28:58] prayer line and you know that God is
[2:29:00] using you as a channel to flow through
[2:29:02] and they have to drag you off the
[2:29:04] platform and put you back around in the
[2:29:06] back hook you up to oxygen or IV or
[2:29:08] something like that that's terrible it's
[2:29:11] an absolute terrible feeling cuz you
[2:29:13] feel like somehow you fail the
[2:29:17] Lord so no matter what we ever do I
[2:29:20] don't think humanly we'll ever get to a
[2:29:21] spot to where we feel like in our own
[2:29:23] eyes we have arrived but I've learned
[2:29:26] what's more important than me thinking I
[2:29:27] have as him knowing where I
[2:29:31] am don't leave here today down don't
[2:29:33] leave disheartened as a matter of fact
[2:29:35] we're going to pray for each other
[2:29:36] before we
[2:29:38] go and I want you to be encouraged
[2:29:41] today we are in a great
[2:29:45] hour the pyramidal body of God has never
[2:29:49] been
[2:29:51] this
[2:29:53] close to the
[2:29:57] Capstone can we just pray for one
[2:29:58] another you just lay your hand on the
[2:30:00] person standing near there if you feel
[2:30:01] comfortable in doing
[2:30:06] so Heavenly Father we know that
[2:30:08] individually you will call your children
[2:30:11] through the channel of death all your
[2:30:13] children don't pass at one time one will
[2:30:16] pass then another then
[2:30:18] another but Lord for those of us who are
[2:30:20] here in this building today who will be
[2:30:23] alive we will not go one at a time we
[2:30:27] will leave this world
[2:30:29] together they may have their hand on a
[2:30:32] brother or a
[2:30:34] sister that will experience the change
[2:30:37] with
[2:30:39] them so Lord help help us to get off off
[2:30:42] the focus of we're we're so different
[2:30:44] and we have we're so far apart and why
[2:30:47] would we want to focus on that when we
[2:30:49] can focus on The God Who can bring us
[2:30:51] together and give us what we have need
[2:30:54] of we'll never be in the same human mind
[2:30:57] what will be in your mind Lord Jesus
