given us once again to come into his sanctuary to worship Him in spirit and in truth good to see all of you this morning look at somebody and tell them you're glad to see them we got some unhappy

requests this morning you can be seated while we look at those brother Daniel done if he's in the building today I want him to come be getting ready to lead us to the Lord in prayer as we pray over these things today but the burning young since this prayer request and I read a couple requests this morning just absolutely well they just get next to you if you just think about in a second this is one of them have a student at Happy Valley High School who is in dire need of a miracle in his life he is an adopted foster kid who has been emotionally and physically abused by his adoptive parent the authorities have intervened and are working on the case I would ask that everyone pray for this young man he has a great kid and he is a Christian so we certainly want to pray for that need that the Lord would just be mindful then here's another request I read this morning please pray for a fourth grader a fourth grade student at Happy Valley just got out of Woodridge talks about killing himself all the time very troubled young man you reach stuff like this where's mom and dad where's the parents that most of them don't even care about stuff like this so we got it we're living in a very troubled world we're living in a world that's vastly quickly quickly turning into a world of hate love is gone love is not existed it's a world filled with hate so we just need to pray for situations like this that God would be mindful also just thinking about you know brother Doug Baker of the Assembly learn to some where they're having the meetings for the Donnie brother Darrell some of the brothers I don't know who all was there but some of the folks is gathered there for those meetings you know they was able to rent a place to have the meetings but you know after the meetings over military reality is really gonna set in they still got to have a place in the days and that and the times that lay ahead you know we need to pray for that assembly that Pastor that God would just be mindful of them and that God would help them in their situation provide them with a good place to worship and to have church they take you've come together or not be afraid of what's going to happen because we're just we're in that place in the world and this time that as I said it's just it's just a lovely not a lovely place to live a man want to remember the family of Jack little check he was killed in a motorcycle accident on Thursday of this week so we want to pray for that family that the Lord would just comfort their hearts be with them they'll be receiving friends at Appalachian funeral home tomorrow evening at six o'clock until 7:00 and then the memorial service for Jack Lynch XO Lester remember let's remember those those folks as we pray today but afraid since this into please remember Pastor John what's that last name riah and family from Indiana they bought land where their church is so that they could have more services and they have had death death

ruler of the Jews Helen Ezra says her and it goes on and says here and he came to Jesus by night and said unto here ever we know Halloween underwear we we don't see these great things you don't know

wonder and it was so impossible when you see the very late so Jesus never pointed him to the miracle he pointed him to the new birth the neck verse and it didn't either asses you know Jesus should have been excited matter of fact there was a good compliment you know that was really a good compliment hey he was getting hallo I'm covered me in your ministry i'ma let you know we are teaching and you a man we know Jew come from God no man can do these miracles I was a good cover me Jesus is hard thank you really but Jilin that was MoveOn Hollywood Jesus never even acknowledged that he goes into the red teaching of the new birth and jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kena of God Halloween let him go right there he's gonna take Revelation he will take you been born again let's see the kingdom of God or understanding Satan job is to keep you from seeing the kingdom of God he don't want you to be born again he want you to go to church and be religious he wants you to go to church and act like a Christmas I'd like you to be a Christmas I didn't go to church like a fool everybody in the church but if you ever get born again you can see where you come from you can see where you go you can see what you a Satan always fight the kingdom of God and he's still fighting today like as they kicking every day now there's total darkness in this world but I will let you know they're gonna be light in the evening time how you know that light is in the evenings and I'm looking at it I'm looking at the light that's in the evening time how least I don't have to guess where today it's already here I lead anywhere when I look at you I see God little lights all over to play Holi shining light to die generation is you cry see you the hope of glory but what you don't notice here now I didn't have money kind of guys I don't know how to I told about the day I said I quit preaching you see it as I found that one day I couldn't do it so I just decided to quit preaching I said God if you're gonna get a people something you do to preach and others help I just get out the way so you can speak the tablet preaches to quit preaching to let God do today I'll do the time for you to quit trying to do it let God take over Holly if I can do it I'll do it I'll make a mess Center but if he take off he know where to put the word in what people gonna be here in a moment I receiving the Word of God in his own but we find you I want you to notice it here I look at it to say this morning Holly I say you know what would Jesus for coming to earth I'll do all he comes to the earth he was a good man he come to her he did great size and wonder like nicotine but look at her but anyway the purpose with Jesus come to work it was not to prove in size of wonder even though we believe in him Jesus come to the earth for one purpose one purpose in it was in first John 3:8 he said whose own committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sent from the beginning for the purpose of the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil how do we didn't come to play Church where they come her that does kill one damn another when I quit smoking Holly that's good that is one nicotine never went out but what about either the devil we gotta deal with he did not call her to get rid of another team to ever he did not call her to get rid of a drug dealer he called him to kill Hannah gamma this far Ellen ever heard never I gonna raise you her honey be mall Santa would not call to kill Elizabeth Felicity he was called to kill the whole nation God raised up to get rid of them you said brother George that will we be able to do it not by your own humans creature will Holly but God will give he will at the end of the day we will become victorious Holly will become my everyday lever devil power here have no more power well Holly women stop it will you get your new body hell you can't say although Dima will finally come to hear it there be no more at all how about you to let you know right now what cold is deep while only demoness her because when the world was created God says you remember he created the heavens and the earth it was created with a period in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and he put a period on it so now I go no hollow we tell you that when appeared only he didn't explain he said in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth / Hollywood a world in the progress a the herp is eternal attribute able to eternal had to be right there I want you to know it was an eternal attribute Halloween in an eternal attribute when God created the heavens in her Holly and eternal attribute and down on his Saturday door he had eternal seas of God that laid there waiting to be quickened and by the power of the Holy Spirit Holly but Satan he was already now dark new was already there another were we laid under friend I was could not be no manifestation because of darkness and ain't no manifestation today because of darkness how did peoples are bound by the Spirit of God and they don't know how to get out I will let you know people know the light like I like this so y'all say here's a pinnacle church we are rising up how do you ride it over water let's show Jesus Christ in this world hallelujah we get overcome not by might not by my screamer battle spirit of God hello good intercessor and God created hey God and in the Bible says her hair day was double the boy and there was darkness darkness is none of God everybody said God is light and there's no darkness in him at all so that was a fallen nature the fallen it was a fire hovered over her and it was bored and it was darkness anyway where it was no sign of manifestation of life in the earth but God moved upon the face of the earth and God said let there be light and we gonna say light the darkness had to move out in a way that what he'd done to your life today you might have been under the daughter you might have been under the power of Sanka but you heard the gospel and it said let there be light hello Eddie had to grow you never see begin to manifest ever see begin to come forth like this I feel his kind beginning to bring forth sees out of the earth hallelujah he didn't land all the time I leave you with God use that all the time I like this Oh Jimmy Swaggart used to say I was there all the time Holly I didn't know I was there but God knew you us how do that why you could come to God because she was there all the time God put something in you how do you can't make it happy you came programming to have it it automatic how do the devil my whole you down say you think law you might your look at your children sometime they feel like they're they so far in the world but don't give up on it either you go go long time when you recognize your son of God but if you are a son of God one day God the light gonna come across your path and you gonna wake up Here I am law because that's what God put in you the God created her he also created everbody that was gonna be manifested on earth he had every body devil will be manifested on earth do you know that
