[13:09] Just to start things off tonight, let me
[13:11] read you a testimony. We're going to
[13:13] sing a little bit more of that. Brother
[13:14] Harry,
[13:16] this is from my niece Sandy Bagot. Three
[13:19] months ago, the doctors found a lesion
[13:21] during an MRI. A month ago, my husband
[13:24] Jim had 12 biopsies and all 12 came back
[13:28] negative for cancer. Somebody say,
[13:31] "Praise the Lord."
[13:36] Hallelujah.
[13:38] A year ago, my brother-in-law could
[13:40] barely move from one end of the house to
[13:42] the other. Remember Dennis Fleer? We
[13:44] came here that Sunday morning in the
[13:45] wheelchair, had prayer for him.
[13:48] He was diagnosed with a rare blood
[13:50] cancer and another disease so rare that
[13:52] he was one of 25 known cases in the
[13:55] world. Two weeks ago, he was helping his
[13:57] sons build a fence. Praise God.
[14:02] Praise God.
[14:08] Last year, last year during our
[14:11] meetings, my son was in a mental
[14:13] facility. I went for prayer. Brother
[14:16] Daryl told me that God had a way to get
[14:18] my son. I'm happy to report he is one
[14:22] year sober. And for the first time in 5
[14:25] years, able to hold a complete full job.
[14:29] God is a way maker.
[14:32] Our God reigns.
[14:38] Yes. Our God reigns. Sing with all your
[14:42] heart. Oh,
[14:45] our God reigns.
[14:50] Oh, do you believe it? Our God reigns.
[14:56] One more time. Oh, our God reigns.
[15:02] Hallelujah. Jesus.
[15:05] Our God reigns.
[15:10] Jesus. Yes. Our God reigns.
[15:17] Oh our God reign. Our God. Yes, he Thank
[15:24] you Lord. Thank you Lord. Give him a
[15:27] hand clap of praise if you love him
[15:29] tonight.

[15:36] day. We should have had a wonderful day

[15:42] service here last night? Amen. Praise
[15:45] the Lord.
[15:48] Thank you, Lord.
[15:50] Now, the first thing I want to do, I
[15:51] want to make an announcement. These
[15:52] these two front rows, they're reserved
[15:54] for ministers. If you ministers, all of
[15:57] you would come and take these seats
[16:00] right here to be able to help in the
[16:02] prayer line. That's what they're asking
[16:03] for. ministers, if you would just fill
[16:06] up these the this row and this row over
[16:08] here, if you'd do that as we sing
[16:11] tonight, we would certainly appreciate

[16:16] bless you. Glad to have you here. Give

[35:39] That's why I'm calling on you, Lord.

[56:02] to me.
[56:12] [Applause]
[56:24] Just uh
[56:26] one word from the Lord Jesus
[56:29] can change everything.
[56:33] I remember
[56:36] when the doctors were telling me that my
[56:39] daughter wouldn't live.
[56:44] I even asked them if they would sew up a
[56:48] gash in her head where she had went
[56:50] through the back window. And
[56:53] a doctor friend told me said, "Darl,
[56:55] there's no use to sew that up.
[56:59] she's not going to live.
[57:01] And they didn't they didn't sew it up.
[57:08] And the day of the funerals
[57:10] when we went to bury brother Homer and
[57:12] little Rachel,
[57:14] we came back to the waiting room
[57:18] and we were sitting there and all at
[57:19] once this warm feeling came over me
[57:24] and a voice spoke to my heart just as
[57:26] real as I'm talking to you right now
[57:30] and said, "Your daughter
[57:32] shall live.
[57:35] [Applause]
[57:46] Just a word from the master
[57:50] makes all the difference in the world.
[57:54] And when I went back to work
[57:57] and some of the my doctor friends and
[58:00] was telling me said, "We was concerned
[58:03] about you. We thought you maybe had had
[58:07] a breakdown and had lost your mind
[58:10] because you were saying that she was
[58:12] going to walk again and see again and
[58:14] all the things that she was going to do.
[58:17] Said, "We thought you'd lost your mind."
[58:18] And I said, "I did.
[58:23] I got the mind of Christ.
[58:25] [Applause]
[58:27] I'm so I'm so glad
[58:33] [Music]
[58:35] I'm so glad that I'm gathered with a
[58:36] group of people this evening
[58:40] that the secrets and the mysteries that
[58:42] was in the back part of God's mind has
[58:45] now been placed into the heart of the
[58:48] believers.
[58:50] Oh, hallelujah.
[58:52] to know what he wants done with his
[58:55] word.
[58:56] Oh, do you love him tonight? He don't
[58:58] want us just to quote it. He don't want
[59:00] us just to read it. He don't want us
[59:01] just to listen to it. But he wants us to
[59:03] receive it and let it live out through
[59:05] us. And what will that do? It'll make
[59:07] him the same yesterday, today, and
[59:10] forever. Do you love him tonight? Amen.
[59:13] God bless you richly.
[59:16] We just count it such an honor to be
[59:18] among you and to stand here before you
[59:21] this evening. And you know I I I
[59:24] feel very small to be ministering with
[59:27] such man of God as brother Matt Watkins
[59:29] and brother David Ser. And I I just
[59:34] y'all pray for me. I'd appreciate it.
[59:36] But I greet you this evening in the
[59:38] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:40] For there is no greater name than the
[59:42] name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. Do you love
[59:45] him?
[59:47] There is power in the name of Jesus.
[59:51] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Wasn't that a
[59:54] powerful message last night that our
[59:56] brother brought? Oh my. We so appreciate
[1:00:00] that, brother Matt. Broken.
[1:00:09] Broken but not bitter. If you have your
[1:00:12] Bibles and turn with us to the book of
[1:00:14] Psalms, we're going to read from Psalms
[1:00:16] 103:es
[1:00:18] 1-4. And then also we're going to read
[1:00:20] from Jeremiah chap 32 26 and 27.
[1:00:25] And may the Lord bless you richly be our
[1:00:28] prayer.
[1:00:42] certainly enjoyed the song service.
[1:00:49] Psalms 103, the Bible says this, a Psalm
[1:00:53] of David,
[1:00:55] bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:00:59] and all that is within me, bless his
[1:01:04] holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:01:08] Forget not all his benefits.
[1:01:12] Don't let your trials, don't let your
[1:01:13] sickness, don't let your fears cause you
[1:01:16] to forget his benefits. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:20] Forget not all his benefits. Who
[1:01:22] forgiveth all thine iniquities.
[1:01:25] Hallelujah. How many? All. Who health
[1:01:28] healeth all thy diseases. How many? All.
[1:01:33] Amen. Lord, who redeemth thy life from
[1:01:36] destruction. Thank you. Who crowneth
[1:01:39] thee with loving kindness
[1:01:42] and tender mercies.
[1:01:44] Oh, I just love that. Jeremiah 32
[1:01:49] 26 and 27, the Bible says this.
[1:01:54] Then came the word of the Lord unto
[1:01:55] Jeremiah, saying,
[1:01:58] "Behold, I am the Lord,
[1:02:02] the God of all flesh.
[1:02:05] Is there anything too hard for me?"
[1:02:10] Amen. Let's bow our heads. That's what
[1:02:12] we want to speak on this evening for
[1:02:14] just a few minutes before the prayer
[1:02:16] line. Is there anything too hard for
[1:02:20] God?
[1:02:24] Heavenly Father,
[1:02:27] Lord, as we have gathered here once
[1:02:30] again,
[1:02:32] we are so grateful, Lord, in our hearts
[1:02:34] that
[1:02:36] you have met with us, Lord.
[1:02:40] And father, we count it such an honor to
[1:02:43] stand before your people
[1:02:46] and bring to them, Lord, not a creed or
[1:02:48] a dogma or someone's ideal,
[1:02:52] but to bring to them the unfailing
[1:02:54] reality of the living word of God. Yes.
[1:02:57] And Lord, I pray tonight, Father, that
[1:02:59] every person in this building that would
[1:03:01] have a need,
[1:03:03] may it be met this evening, dear God.
[1:03:06] And Lord, those that have never
[1:03:08] witnessed a miracle, may they witness
[1:03:10] it. And those dear God that would be
[1:03:12] weak, may they be made strong. And Lord,
[1:03:14] those who have got a bad report, may
[1:03:17] they hear Isaiah's report. We pray.
[1:03:19] Amen. And Father God, we ask tonight
[1:03:22] that you would be with the brothers who
[1:03:23] will labor, Lord, through the prayer
[1:03:25] line. May you strengthen them, dear God,
[1:03:27] and keep them be our prayer.
[1:03:29] And Lord, we commit this congregation
[1:03:31] and oursel into your hands for your
[1:03:33] glory.
[1:03:35] And when we leave this building this
[1:03:36] evening, may we say, "Did not our hearts
[1:03:38] burn within us as you walked and talked
[1:03:41] with us along the way?" Father God,
[1:03:44] those who are unable to be here that
[1:03:46] would be streaming tonight, I ask you,
[1:03:48] Father God, may the Holy Ghost go to
[1:03:51] where they're at, Lord, and whatever the
[1:03:53] need would be, God, right there in their
[1:03:55] living room, may they stand and give you
[1:03:58] praise for the God who hears the prayer
[1:04:00] of his people. We commit these things
[1:04:03] into your hands, Lord, for your glory.
[1:04:05] For we are so glad tonight that we know
[1:04:08] that there is nothing that is too hard
[1:04:12] for you.
[1:04:14] We ask these things in Jesus' name. And
[1:04:16] the bride says, "Amen." God bless you.
[1:04:19] You may be seated.
[1:04:22] You know, uh, several years ago when I
[1:04:25] was working in surgery
[1:04:28] and I I worked in surgery for years,
[1:04:30] assisted the doctor in many many kinds
[1:04:32] of operations
[1:04:34] and we had a case come in one day of
[1:04:38] this gentleman
[1:04:40] and he he was a a Baptist preacher
[1:04:44] and he had thrown a blood clot and
[1:04:46] almost all of his bow had died.
[1:04:51] And when he came into surgery, he was in
[1:04:53] a serious condition.
[1:04:55] And the doctor made this statement while
[1:04:58] we was working on this man. He said,
[1:05:00] "This man will die.
[1:05:02] He cannot live.
[1:05:05] He doesn't have enough bow left to
[1:05:08] live."
[1:05:10] And as I was standing across from the
[1:05:12] doctor, I I didn't speak it out loud,
[1:05:14] but I just said it to myself. I said,
[1:05:16] "That's true, Lord.
[1:05:19] I don't see how he can live.
[1:05:24] And all at once,
[1:05:28] this presence came over me. Amen. And I
[1:05:32] started to tear up and I turned my head
[1:05:34] away because I didn't want him to see
[1:05:36] the tears in my eyes.
[1:05:38] And a voice spoke to my heart.
[1:05:42] It said, "Is there anything too hard for
[1:05:44] God?" Amen.
[1:05:47] And I said, "No, Lord.
[1:05:51] There's nothing too hard for you."
[1:05:55] You can do anything.
[1:05:58] You're God.
[1:06:01] And that man lived.
[1:06:04] For many years after that surgery, he
[1:06:07] lived. And about a year later, I saw him
[1:06:09] in the cafeteria at the VA hospital. And
[1:06:12] of course, he didn't know me, but I knew
[1:06:14] him.
[1:06:15] And when I sat down in front of him, you
[1:06:17] know, he kind of had this look like,
[1:06:18] "Who's this guy?" And I said, called him
[1:06:22] by his name. And I said, "You don't know
[1:06:24] me, but I was on your operation."
[1:06:28] And I begin to tell him what I just told
[1:06:30] you. And me and him both sat there in
[1:06:32] the cafeteria and wept before the Lord
[1:06:36] and rejoice because there is nothing
[1:06:39] that is too hard for God.
[1:06:45] Hallelujah.
[1:06:47] The God who redeems our lives from
[1:06:51] destruction,
[1:06:52] who crowns, or in other words, who
[1:06:54] surrounds us with loving kindness and
[1:06:58] tender mercies. The prophet said, "It is
[1:07:01] only the love of our father that loves
[1:07:04] us so much that he sends his word."
[1:07:08] Yeah. He sends ministers to preach his
[1:07:12] word.
[1:07:14] Amen. Then whoever would try to stop
[1:07:16] ministers from preaching must not come
[1:07:18] from God.
[1:07:20] Come on. He sends his ministers to
[1:07:24] preach the word. He sends gifts into the
[1:07:28] church with his arms spread out trying
[1:07:31] to get you to believe it.
[1:07:34] How many needs healing tonight?
[1:07:38] How many of you has a loved one that
[1:07:39] needs healing tonight? And you would
[1:07:42] love to see them healed with all your
[1:07:44] heart.
[1:07:46] Can I get an amen tonight? That you
[1:07:49] would love to see that person healed.
[1:07:51] That you would love to see them touch
[1:07:52] you. Say, "I give anything to see that."
[1:07:56] Well, I want you to know tonight that
[1:07:59] the prophet of God said that God wants
[1:08:01] to heal you 1,000 times more than you
[1:08:05] ought to be healed.
[1:08:07] Hallelujah. You said, "Oh, brother D, I
[1:08:09] want to be healed so bad that I can
[1:08:11] serve him." He wants to heal you a
[1:08:13] thousand times more than you ever want
[1:08:15] to be healed. Amen. Amen. But he said,
[1:08:18] "But you're afraid. You go by how you
[1:08:21] feel
[1:08:23] because you've regarded that. You've
[1:08:25] lived by your feelings. Your whole life
[1:08:28] has been wrapped in that. But you must
[1:08:30] get away from that and act on God's
[1:08:34] word. Yes, sir. Amen. Not what you feel.
[1:08:40] Not what you feel. Your feelings will
[1:08:42] lie to you.
[1:08:45] Not what you feel, not what you see, but
[1:08:48] what God said. Amen. Act upon what God
[1:08:52] said. Make that confession. Amen. And
[1:08:55] confession means to say the same thing.
[1:08:59] Then if I'm going to confess something,
[1:09:01] don't let me confess my sickness or my
[1:09:03] weakness, but let me confess what God
[1:09:05] said in his word. I am the Lord thy God
[1:09:08] who health all thy diseases. Amen.
[1:09:12] Amen. Make that confession. A confession
[1:09:15] needs to say the same thing. And he's at
[1:09:18] the right hand of the father with his
[1:09:20] own blood to make intercession on your
[1:09:24] confession. Amen.
[1:09:26] He cannot do anything for you until
[1:09:30] first you accept it, confess it, and
[1:09:34] then act on it.
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:38] The prophet of God said, "If angels came
[1:09:40] and laid hands on you,
[1:09:44] you could not be healed unless you
[1:09:46] accepted it, believed it, and acted on
[1:09:50] it."
[1:09:51] You say, "Why is that?" Because he is
[1:09:53] the high priest.
[1:09:56] of what you confess,
[1:09:59] what you confess that he is to you. Then
[1:10:01] what do we need to tell him? You're my
[1:10:03] healer. You're my sustainer. You're my
[1:10:06] deliverer. You're my all and all. Amen.
[1:10:09] With you, I can do everything. Without
[1:10:11] you, I could do nothing.
[1:10:13] Thank you, Lord. Have faith in God.
[1:10:15] Don't doubt. We don't see all things,
[1:10:18] but he never asked us to see all things,
[1:10:21] but we do see Jesus.
[1:10:24] Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] So I say to you tonight, let's don't go
[1:10:28] by what we see or feel with the eyes of
[1:10:30] our head, but let's look with the eyes
[1:10:34] of our heart to a God who loves us,
[1:10:38] who loves us, and wants to heal us, and
[1:10:42] wants to help us. Amen.
[1:10:46] Isaiah 41 says it this way, "For I, the
[1:10:50] Lord thy God, will hold thy right hand,
[1:10:55] say unto thee, fear not." Amen. I will
[1:11:00] help thee, sir.
[1:11:04] The God who holds our right hand.
[1:11:09] That's right. Oh, I remember a few years
[1:11:11] ago when my girls were little and we was
[1:11:14] we was hiking. Thank you, brother
[1:11:16] Donnie. We sure appreciate, brother
[1:11:18] Donnie.
[1:11:20] And we was hiking up on Ruff Ridge up in
[1:11:22] North Carolina. Yeah, that's all right.
[1:11:23] Give me a hand.
[1:11:31] It's up on the rough ridge up there in
[1:11:32] North Carolina, you know, and it's kind
[1:11:34] of pretty high up. You can see from
[1:11:35] everywhere when you get up there and the
[1:11:37] clouds are always on the mountain. So we
[1:11:39] were coming back down, you know, and I
[1:11:40] was leading the way, the Danny, you
[1:11:42] know, leading the way. And I think
[1:11:43] Alison, well, I know it was Alison, she
[1:11:45] was behind me. And so we was coming down
[1:11:46] through there and there was this rock
[1:11:47] and you had to step off this rock. It
[1:11:50] was about like a 2ft 3ft drop down to
[1:11:52] the ground and the rocks were wet
[1:11:53] because the clouds had been in there.
[1:11:55] And so I was walking down through there
[1:11:57] and I stepped off the rock and I heard
[1:11:58] Allison behind me. She's just a little
[1:12:00] old thing. And I just turned around and
[1:12:03] I just grabbed her by the hand. And I no
[1:12:06] sooner grabbed her by the hand that her
[1:12:08] feet flew out from under her on that wet
[1:12:10] rock. The look of horror that was on her
[1:12:13] face.
[1:12:15] But when I had her in the hand and I
[1:12:17] just swung her around and set her right
[1:12:19] down in front of me, that horror turned
[1:12:22] to the biggest grin you have ever seen
[1:12:24] in your life.
[1:12:27] And I said to her, I said, "Ally, ain't
[1:12:29] you glad daddy has got a hold of your
[1:12:31] hand?" And she did like that. Hold on
[1:12:34] down the trail you with. Oh, saints of
[1:12:36] God tonight. Aren't you glad that daddy
[1:12:39] and father has got us right? Hallelujah.
[1:12:42] He's got a hold of my right hand. Amen.
[1:12:44] And he said, "Fear not. I will help
[1:12:47] you."
[1:12:51] Hallelujah.
[1:12:53] Oh, aren't you glad tonight? God said,
[1:12:56] "I'll hold your right hand." Let's look
[1:12:58] and see that there's nothing we face. No
[1:13:01] sickness, no sorrow, no bondage, no
[1:13:04] oppression, no mental trouble, no
[1:13:06] marital trouble, no insecurities, no
[1:13:08] addictions.
[1:13:10] There is nothing that is too hard for
[1:13:14] our God.
[1:13:16] He's the God of all flesh. Yes, sir.
[1:13:20] He's the God of all history.
[1:13:23] He's the God of all nations.
[1:13:26] He's the God of all generations.
[1:13:28] He's the God of all grace. He's the God
[1:13:32] of all life. He's the God of all races.
[1:13:36] He's the God of all prophets.
[1:13:39] He's the God of all wisdom.
[1:13:43] And he's our God tonight. And there is
[1:13:46] nothing that's too hard for our God. He
[1:13:49] is the God of creation.
[1:13:52] He's the God of creation. Amen. And
[1:13:54] Jeremiah said, "Yay, Lord. Behold, thou
[1:13:57] hast made the heaven and the earth by
[1:13:59] thy great power and stretched out arm.
[1:14:02] And there is nothing too hard for thee.
[1:14:06] God's power in creation. Consider
[1:14:10] the majestics of creation.
[1:14:13] You know, I love to go out west and just
[1:14:15] see the mountains and oh my the beauty
[1:14:18] of creation. And God spoke the universe
[1:14:21] into existence
[1:14:24] with just his words. He said, "Let there
[1:14:28] be." And there was.
[1:14:33] And the same God that said, "Let there
[1:14:35] be a moon. Let there be stars. Let there
[1:14:38] be a sun." That same God said, "I am the
[1:14:41] Lord that health thee."
[1:14:46] Think about that. The stars, the
[1:14:48] mountain, the oceans, all obey his
[1:14:51] command. And if God can craft the cosmos
[1:14:55] with just his word, how much more can he
[1:14:58] handle the problems we face?
[1:15:03] [Applause]
[1:15:04] The same God who designed the increant
[1:15:07] details of DNA.
[1:15:10] Think about that. How this body
[1:15:12] operates, it's absolutely amazing.
[1:15:16] fashion the complexities of nature is
[1:15:19] not limited.
[1:15:21] He is not limited. My God is not limited
[1:15:26] by any situation
[1:15:29] or circumstance
[1:15:31] I face.
[1:15:33] Say, "Well, brother Daryl, my
[1:15:35] situation's too hard for God."
[1:15:38] Really? Come on. That problem that
[1:15:41] you're dealing with is too hard for the
[1:15:43] God who created the heavens and the
[1:15:47] earth.
[1:15:49] Amen.
[1:15:52] My situation, brother, it's it's it's
[1:15:54] too hard. The doctor said it's too bad.
[1:15:56] Listen to me. Do not let the devil rob
[1:15:59] you
[1:16:00] of what God has already done for you.
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:06] Think about this. There are 200 billion
[1:16:10] trillion stars
[1:16:13] in the observable universe.
[1:16:16] Oh god, I can barely count to 100. 200
[1:16:21] billion trillion stars in the observable
[1:16:25] universe. And the Bible said he health
[1:16:28] the brokenhearted and bindeth up their
[1:16:31] wounds.
[1:16:33] He tellth the number of stars. He
[1:16:35] calleth them all by their name.
[1:16:40] Hallelujah.
[1:16:42] 200 billion trillion stars and our God
[1:16:46] knows every star by name.
[1:16:52] How? Because he created them and he
[1:16:55] placed them. He created them with his
[1:16:58] word and he placed them. Is there
[1:17:01] anything too hard for our God?
[1:17:03] Is there anything you face too hard for
[1:17:05] a God who knows the name of 200 billion
[1:17:09] trillion stars that he created with his
[1:17:11] word?
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:14] Is there anything too hard for our God?
[1:17:16] Is your blood pressure too hard for God?
[1:17:17] Is your diabetes? Is your fear? Is your
[1:17:20] oppression? Is your arthritis? Is your
[1:17:22] tonitis? Is your cancer? Is your marital
[1:17:26] problem? Is your addiction?
[1:17:28] [Applause]
[1:17:31] Is there anything too hard for a God who
[1:17:33] created the universe? That God also
[1:17:36] created your body. Hallelujah.
[1:17:41] Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] Let's look at a few just for a few
[1:17:45] minutes before we call the prayer line
[1:17:47] of what man would call impossible
[1:17:51] situations.
[1:17:53] And the first one comes to my mind
[1:17:56] is Jonah.
[1:17:59] Now Jonah is in a fish's belly, the
[1:18:03] belly of the whale. A man who had more
[1:18:06] symptoms, more circumstances against him
[1:18:09] than any man I know of. Has anybody here
[1:18:12] in this building been swallowed by a
[1:18:14] fish?
[1:18:16] He was
[1:18:18] He was swallowed
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:21] by a fish.
[1:18:23] And when this whale swallowed him, the
[1:18:25] prophet said he went down to the bottom
[1:18:27] of the sea to rest. And that was Jonah
[1:18:30] wallowing around in the vomic at the
[1:18:33] bottom of the sea. And the prophet said,
[1:18:36] brother said, I always thought people
[1:18:38] say, why my arm is no better. My foot's
[1:18:40] no better. I don't feel any better.
[1:18:42] You'll never feel any better looking
[1:18:45] like that. Looking at that, you're
[1:18:48] looking at your symptoms. As long as you
[1:18:51] look at your symptoms, you're not going
[1:18:53] to see nothing else but your symptoms.
[1:18:57] You see, it depends on what you're
[1:18:59] looking at.
[1:19:02] This great fish swallowed Jonah on a
[1:19:06] Look at the situ. He was on a stormy
[1:19:09] sea. The boat was sinking. They threw
[1:19:12] him overboard and a fish swallowed him
[1:19:15] and went right to the bottom of the
[1:19:17] ocean.
[1:19:19] many phantoms deep laying there resting
[1:19:23] his swimmers cuz he just swallowed a 200
[1:19:26] lb
[1:19:28] happy meal.
[1:19:35] Well, that's pretty good. I wouldn't
[1:19:36] mind having another one of them.
[1:19:40] And
[1:19:42] and Jonah was backslid.
[1:19:46] His hands were tied. His feet were tied
[1:19:52] and he's in the belly of a whale with
[1:19:54] vomic all over him. Seaweed wrapped
[1:19:56] around his neck in the bottom of the
[1:19:59] ocean. I'm telling you right now, there
[1:20:01] ain't nobody here in that bad a
[1:20:04] situation tonight.
[1:20:07] But what did Jonah say? The prophet said
[1:20:10] everywhere he looked was symptoms. He
[1:20:13] looked this way. What did he see? Whales
[1:20:15] belly. Looked that way. What did he see?
[1:20:17] Whales belly. Looked up. What did he
[1:20:19] see? Whalebelly. Looked down. What did
[1:20:21] he see? Whales belly. Everywhere he
[1:20:24] looked was whales belly.
[1:20:29] And you know what he said?
[1:20:31] He said, "They're lying vanities."
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:36] And Jonah said, "They that observe lying
[1:20:39] vanities forsake their own mercy."
[1:20:43] That's right. When you look Oh, God.
[1:20:46] When you look at your symptoms or your
[1:20:48] problem,
[1:20:50] you are forsaken. The mercies of God,
[1:20:52] the loving kindness and mercies of God
[1:20:56] who surround you with his love.
[1:21:00] And brother Ben said he knew when
[1:21:02] Solomon dedicated the temple, he said,
[1:21:04] "Lord, if thy people be in trouble
[1:21:06] anywhere,
[1:21:07] anywhere that includes whalebelly,
[1:21:10] anywhere and pray and look towards this
[1:21:13] temple, then hear from heaven." and he
[1:21:16] believed Solomon's prayer. You know why?
[1:21:20] There's power in prayer. Yes.
[1:21:24] And if Jonah under those conditions with
[1:21:27] that kind of symptoms could look to an
[1:21:30] earthly temple where an earthly man who
[1:21:32] later backslid
[1:21:34] and could believe that and be delivered
[1:21:36] from those symptoms and refused to see
[1:21:39] them, how much more ought you and I who
[1:21:43] are filled with the Holy Ghost, we don't
[1:21:45] look towards an earthly temple, but
[1:21:48] heaven where Jesus sits at the right
[1:21:49] hand of God with his own bloody garment
[1:21:52] making intercession on your confession.
[1:21:54] Thousands are being healed everywhere. I
[1:21:57] refuse to see any I refuse to see
[1:21:59] anything that's contrary to God's word.
[1:22:04] God said so that settles it.
[1:22:12] Amen. Now, I'm not against doctors. I go
[1:22:15] to doctors. I I got nothing against
[1:22:16] doctors. But when they can't help us, I
[1:22:19] know somebody who can. Amen.
[1:22:22] And people put so much faith in a doctor
[1:22:26] and they don't realize he graduated last
[1:22:28] in his class. And the only reason he's
[1:22:31] got a degree is cuz his daddy was dean
[1:22:32] of the school. Ask me how I know that.
[1:22:38] But I got nothing against them because
[1:22:41] they can be 100% correct and they can be
[1:22:44] 100% wrong. That's right. A doctor's
[1:22:47] report can be right, you can be wrong.
[1:22:49] But Isaiah's report is always right.
[1:22:56] God said so that settled it. I'm
[1:22:58] Abraham's seed. I'm an heir to all
[1:23:01] things. We're better said, get that
[1:23:03] down, not in your intellect, but get it
[1:23:06] down in your heart one time and watch
[1:23:08] the devil. You'll see his red light
[1:23:11] going over the hill cuz the Bible said,
[1:23:14] "Resist him and he will flee from you."
[1:23:24] I wonder sometimes if he hangs around us
[1:23:26] so much because we entertain him.
[1:23:32] But I want you to know you've got the
[1:23:33] ability to back him off.
[1:23:38] back. BAC. Back him off. What in the
[1:23:42] world is back? BAC. I'm glad you asked.
[1:23:45] Believe, accept, and confess.
[1:23:48] Hallelujah. When you back, Hallelujah.
[1:23:51] When you stand on that back, Satan will
[1:23:53] back off of you.
[1:23:56] The Bible said Jonah prayed unto the
[1:23:58] Lord God out of a fish's belly. He said,
[1:24:02] "I cried by the reason of my affliction
[1:24:04] unto the Lord, and he heard me. Out of
[1:24:09] the belly of hell cried I, and thou
[1:24:12] heardest my voice."
[1:24:16] I cried out to the Lord. I cried out to
[1:24:19] the Lord. And if God can hear the prayer
[1:24:21] of a man in the belly of a great fish at
[1:24:24] the bottom of the ocean and deliver him,
[1:24:26] don't you think he can hear your prayer
[1:24:28] sitting in this building tonight that's
[1:24:30] been set aside to worship him?
[1:24:35] Hallelujah. We're not surrounded by
[1:24:36] whales belly tonight. We're not
[1:24:38] surrounded by seaweed tonight. We're
[1:24:40] surrounded by believing sons and
[1:24:42] daughters of God who believes our God is
[1:24:45] able to deliver us.
[1:24:49] Can God deliver us? I say yes, He can.
[1:24:54] Cuz there's nothing too hard for our
[1:24:57] God. He delivered a man trapped in a
[1:25:01] fish's belly at the bottom of the ocean.
[1:25:04] Then he can deliver you tonight in
[1:25:06] whatever trap you find yourself in. Just
[1:25:11] cry out to him. He is our deliverer. He
[1:25:14] is our healer. He is our refuge and our
[1:25:17] strength, a very present help in the
[1:25:21] time of trouble.
[1:25:27] You see, healing, oh my, healing can
[1:25:30] occur instantly.
[1:25:32] That's right.
[1:25:34] Or gradually.
[1:25:36] That's right. Or even in the future.
[1:25:40] But all healing comes from God.
[1:25:46] And I think of J Gyus and his daughter.
[1:25:51] She was at home sick. She was dying.
[1:25:56] And it was his only little girl
[1:26:01] and there and there was nothing that he
[1:26:03] could do to help her. Yeah.
[1:26:05] He just watched her lay there
[1:26:10] and he thought, "I've got to find Jesus.
[1:26:15] He's the only one who can help her.
[1:26:19] I'm going to go find Jesus."
[1:26:23] And when he got to Jesus,
[1:26:26] Jesus said,
[1:26:28] "I'll go." He said, "Lord, my daughter's
[1:26:32] dying. She's my only little girl. Don't
[1:26:35] take her from me.
[1:26:38] Where you come? Where you come? I'll go.
[1:26:45] And as they started to go,
[1:26:49] here come the mourers. Come on. With a
[1:26:52] message, do not trouble the master
[1:26:55] anymore,
[1:26:56] for your daughter is already dead.
[1:27:01] It's over.
[1:27:03] She passed just a little bit after you
[1:27:05] left the house. We've been trying to
[1:27:07] find you to tell you it's over. There's
[1:27:10] no use for him to come.
[1:27:13] Don't trouble him anymore. That's the
[1:27:16] way we get sometimes when we think
[1:27:18] there's no hope.
[1:27:21] But is there anything too hard for our
[1:27:23] God? He's still the mighty conqueror.
[1:27:26] When all hope is gone, he's still the
[1:27:29] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:27:34] They thought it was over. The prophet
[1:27:36] said they had already embombed her
[1:27:38] little body and laid her on the couch.
[1:27:41] And they said, "Don't trouble him. All
[1:27:44] hope is gone."
[1:27:48] Come on. And as her daddy looked toward
[1:27:51] Jesus and he started to cry, the
[1:27:54] precious eyes of Jesus turned to Gyrus
[1:27:58] and said these words that are an answer
[1:28:02] to every problem in this building
[1:28:05] tonight.
[1:28:06] When Jesus spoke these words, I want you
[1:28:09] to know what he said to Gyrus is the
[1:28:11] answer to every problem in this building
[1:28:14] tonight.
[1:28:16] when he touched him on the shoulder and
[1:28:19] he said, "Only
[1:28:22] believe.
[1:28:25] Don't fear. Only believe and thou shalt
[1:28:29] see the glory of the Lord." And I say to
[1:28:31] you tonight, don't fear.
[1:28:34] Just believe and you shall see the glory
[1:28:37] of God.
[1:28:39] Is there anything too hard for God? A
[1:28:43] woman with the blood issue. I know you
[1:28:45] know these things, but just to remind
[1:28:46] you to try to build her faith up before
[1:28:48] the prayer line. This woman had a
[1:28:50] bloodish you for 12 long years she bled.
[1:28:54] And not only that, when she went into
[1:28:56] the sound, when she went into the city,
[1:28:58] she had to announce to everybody
[1:29:00] unclean. I'm unclean.
[1:29:03] And for 12 years, she dealt with the
[1:29:05] embarrassment
[1:29:07] of being rejected and isolated and
[1:29:10] nobody around her cuz she was unclean.
[1:29:12] 12 long years, sir. The prophet said
[1:29:17] she'd spent all of her money on doctors
[1:29:19] who finally told her, "We can't help
[1:29:23] you."
[1:29:25] Wouldn't it be nice if they told her the
[1:29:27] first visit?
[1:29:30] The prophet said she sold her farm and
[1:29:32] everything,
[1:29:35] 12 long years
[1:29:43] sitting out there and knitting. One day
[1:29:44] the prophet said her world was crashing
[1:29:46] in on her.
[1:29:48] Sometimes it just builds to the point
[1:29:51] that you feel like you can't take it no
[1:29:52] more.
[1:29:54] You know what I'm talking about? when
[1:29:55] your nerves are just on edge and you
[1:29:57] think I can't deal with it today
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] sitting there out in the sun maybe
[1:30:05] trying to knit just to get her mind up
[1:30:06] of her problems thinking they can't help
[1:30:08] me what am I going to do there's no
[1:30:10] answer to my problem there's no answer
[1:30:12] to what I'm going through with
[1:30:14] all at once somebody comes running by
[1:30:16] and he says the healer is coming the
[1:30:18] healer is here he's coming and we heard
[1:30:21] those words the healer
[1:30:24] something struck a her and you know the
[1:30:26] story. She ran down to where he was at
[1:30:27] and she saw him. This is the son of God.
[1:30:31] Hallelujah.
[1:30:34] Hallelujah. She said no matter what the
[1:30:36] people say because it's always an ever
[1:30:38] crowd. Some are for him and some are
[1:30:39] against him. Some were calling him a
[1:30:41] cult and all kinds of nonsense. But
[1:30:44] there in the midst of all of this, she
[1:30:46] saw something. Hallelujah. Not with the
[1:30:48] eyes of her head, but with the eyes of
[1:30:49] her heart. She saw that man can help me.
[1:30:52] And if that man can help her, he can
[1:30:54] help you tonight.
[1:30:57] Hallelujah. You see, he's just changed
[1:30:59] his stom. The God that was in the body
[1:31:02] of Jesus is now in the body of his
[1:31:05] bride.
[1:31:08] He'll use my hands, your hands, my eyes,
[1:31:11] your eyes, my lips, your lips.
[1:31:15] Hallelujah. She pressed her way through
[1:31:18] the crowd being weak in that anemic
[1:31:22] condition, the loss of blood weakening.
[1:31:24] And she finally got to where he was.
[1:31:28] Perhaps she's small in statue cuz the
[1:31:30] Bible said she never touched his
[1:31:32] shoulder. She never touched his arm.
[1:31:36] She squeezed through the crowd and got
[1:31:38] down. Sometimes we just need to humble
[1:31:40] oursel down. Sometimes we just need to
[1:31:42] say, "God, I need your help. This is
[1:31:45] bigger than I can handle. This is bigger
[1:31:47] than I know what to do with, Lord.
[1:31:51] She got down and squeezing through the
[1:31:53] crowd,
[1:31:55] reaching through the crowd. And the
[1:31:56] prophet of God said she had to go and
[1:31:59] reach through those hindrances, trying
[1:32:01] to press her way into Jesus.
[1:32:05] Had to squeeze through some of them,
[1:32:06] pressing her way. And he said, "If you
[1:32:08] ever get to Christ, you're going to have
[1:32:11] to press your way to him cuz there's
[1:32:14] going to be all kinds of people who's
[1:32:17] trying to hold you back.
[1:32:20] Sometimes it's those that's closest to
[1:32:23] us."
[1:32:27] You see, Satan loves barriers.
[1:32:31] He loves hindrances. anything that'll
[1:32:35] keep you from touching Jesus. Amen. For
[1:32:39] touching Jesus is all that really
[1:32:41] matters and then your life will never be
[1:32:44] the same. Amen.
[1:32:47] You know that gate that they put the
[1:32:49] horses behind before the race starts.
[1:32:51] They put them behind this gate and they
[1:32:53] shut the gate. And they do that so that
[1:32:54] it'll be a fair start for every horse.
[1:32:56] So they back them in and they shut this
[1:32:58] gate and it keeps the horse from moving.
[1:33:01] You know what it's called? It's called
[1:33:03] the barrier.
[1:33:06] They put the horse behind a barrier to
[1:33:09] keep it from running, to keep it from
[1:33:12] moving. It's called the gate barrier.
[1:33:14] But do you know what that barrier
[1:33:16] testifies of? It testifies that up just
[1:33:19] ahead there is a victory lion.
[1:33:22] And when Satan tries to hold you back,
[1:33:24] when he tries to put hindrances in your
[1:33:26] life, when he tries to put barriers in
[1:33:27] your life, just remember your miracle is
[1:33:30] there. Amen. It's your victory. Amen.
[1:33:36] I say you may have thought all hell to
[1:33:37] get here tonight. You may had all kinds
[1:33:39] of hindrances to get here tonight, but
[1:33:41] you're here and you're here tonight for
[1:33:43] your greatest miracle.
[1:33:47] They said there's no limit hardly to the
[1:33:50] speed a plane will go when it breaks the
[1:33:53] sound barrier.
[1:33:56] And if there's no limit to the speed the
[1:33:57] plane will go, then there's no limits to
[1:34:00] the blessings that God will pour down
[1:34:02] upon a believer that will believe.
[1:34:07] When all the barriers that seem to
[1:34:08] hinder you are broken, then you will fly
[1:34:11] free in the faith of God, knowing that
[1:34:15] all things are possible because there is
[1:34:19] nothing too hard for our God. You see,
[1:34:23] it's your attitude towards a divine gift
[1:34:25] of God which determines what's going to
[1:34:28] happen. It's your attitude. Yes, sir.
[1:34:35] And that woman squeezed through the
[1:34:37] crowd just
[1:34:40] and as soon as she touched him, not his
[1:34:42] arm, not his back,
[1:34:45] his garment,
[1:34:47] his garment. She touched the hymn of his
[1:34:50] garment. And she thought in her heart,
[1:34:52] "If I could but do that, I will be made
[1:34:56] whole." And she slipped out into the
[1:34:59] yard. And Jesus turned around and said,
[1:35:02] "Who touched me? Who touched me?" I
[1:35:04] said, "Master, have you you're
[1:35:06] embarrassing? Everybody here's touching
[1:35:08] you. Everybody's trying to get to you.
[1:35:09] What do you mean who's touching you?" He
[1:35:11] said, "But I perceive that I've gotten
[1:35:14] weak.
[1:35:15] Virtue has went out from me."
[1:35:19] And he turned, the prophet said, to
[1:35:21] begin to follow where that flow was
[1:35:23] coming from. And as he looked around, he
[1:35:25] found the woman. And he said to this
[1:35:27] woman, "Thy faith hath saved thee."
[1:35:31] Yeah. Not my power.
[1:35:34] Not my power. Not my power, but thy
[1:35:38] faith hath saved thee.
[1:35:43] By faith. By faith in believing what he
[1:35:47] was. For she said, she believed what he
[1:35:50] was. She said, "If I can but touch his
[1:35:53] garment." Jesus never said it. Peter
[1:35:55] never said that. That woman said that.
[1:35:57] We don't even know her name. But her
[1:35:59] words of faith, her inspiration of faith
[1:36:03] becomes the very word of God we read
[1:36:05] tonight. For when a son of God by faith
[1:36:08] takes the word of God into his heart and
[1:36:10] speaks it back upon his lips, it's just
[1:36:12] the same as deity speaking. Every
[1:36:14] mountain has to move.
[1:36:16] And I say tonight, the lion hath roared.
[1:36:19] We can say what's already been said in
[1:36:21] the word.
[1:36:25] Hallelujah. Congressman Upshaw, who was
[1:36:29] crippled for 66
[1:36:33] years, not seconds, not months, not
[1:36:37] days, years. And how many of his family
[1:36:42] or his friends had gave up that he would
[1:36:46] ever walk normal again? After all, it'd
[1:36:50] been 66 years since he fell off that
[1:36:54] wagon and broke his back.
[1:36:58] 66
[1:37:01] years.
[1:37:03] Sometimes we can't wait 66 seconds.
[1:37:08] How many times did he ask God to heal
[1:37:10] him? How many times did someone offer
[1:37:14] prayer for him?
[1:37:16] 66
[1:37:19] years.
[1:37:22] I've got this problem. Have you had it?
[1:37:24] 66 years.
[1:37:28] 66
[1:37:30] years he has been in this affliction.
[1:37:33] And the prophet said, "I never even
[1:37:35] touched the man in no way. I just stood
[1:37:37] there. I did see a vision of the man."
[1:37:40] That's true. And then, oh, I like this
[1:37:43] right here. I saw a vision. That's true.
[1:37:47] And then he just accepted
[1:37:50] what I said. And that was all.
[1:37:55] And there he is walking.
[1:37:58] I never had nothing to do with it. His
[1:38:00] faith in Lord Jesus is what made him
[1:38:03] whole.
[1:38:04] I've seen him without crutches and
[1:38:06] without a wheelchair walking as nimble
[1:38:08] as he can be. That man after being
[1:38:10] crippled for 66 years. I said, "Thus say
[1:38:13] the Lord." And here he is tonight, 85
[1:38:16] years old, as nimble as any man, 50 in
[1:38:19] the building. It looked like he had
[1:38:20] gotten healed back when his bones had
[1:38:22] good calcium and stuff back when he was
[1:38:24] young. But God in his power showed that
[1:38:28] he could do all things.
[1:38:33] Abraham and Sarah, God promised when he
[1:38:35] was 75 year old that he would have a
[1:38:37] child. 25 years went by and now here he
[1:38:40] is 100 and Sarah's 90. And God visited
[1:38:44] Abraham and said, "I have made you the
[1:38:45] promise and now I'm going to fulfill
[1:38:47] it." And Sarah in the tent, you know the
[1:38:49] story. back behind the tents that guy
[1:38:52] sniggering up in her tent said, "Oh, me
[1:38:53] an old woman, no pleasure with my Lord."
[1:38:55] How would this ever be?
[1:38:57] How would this ever be? But oh my, there
[1:39:01] is nothing too hard for God. Amen.
[1:39:04] Be an old woman, have pleasure with my
[1:39:06] Lord. And Abraham being old too, both of
[1:39:08] them wellstricken in age. How can this
[1:39:10] be? And the Lord said unto Abraham,
[1:39:11] Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, I
[1:39:13] shall surely bear a child, which I am
[1:39:15] old? Is there anything too hard for the
[1:39:17] Lord? And at the appointed time, I will
[1:39:20] return unto thee according to the time
[1:39:21] of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
[1:39:26] What was God saying? I will restore you
[1:39:29] back to a young man and woman again. And
[1:39:32] let me say tonight, saints of God, all
[1:39:34] that life and time has took away from
[1:39:36] you, God will restore. Amen. He'll
[1:39:39] change our bodies back again. Not just
[1:39:42] to youth, but to eternal youth.
[1:39:44] Hallelujah. And just a couple more we'll
[1:39:47] close, go into the prayer line. But I
[1:39:49] just wanted to bring this in tonight of
[1:39:51] Joshua standing before the walls that
[1:39:53] was 46t high and 80 foot thick. And
[1:39:56] before one rock ever came out of the
[1:39:59] walls of Jericho, Joshua walked around
[1:40:01] the walls shouting the victory.
[1:40:05] Lord, by faith he saw the victory. Amen.
[1:40:08] He knew the walls was coming down and he
[1:40:10] armed his men and walked around and
[1:40:11] around Jericho seven days in full armor.
[1:40:13] What was he doing? He was looking at the
[1:40:15] unseen because God Hallelujah. It was a
[1:40:19] promise from God that the walls would
[1:40:21] come down.
[1:40:24] Hallelujah. And God, that same God has
[1:40:28] made you a promise. And I say to you
[1:40:31] tonight, how much can you walk around a
[1:40:33] wheelchair? How much can you walk around
[1:40:35] cancer? How much can you walk around
[1:40:37] that sin shouting the victory? God gives
[1:40:39] the promise when you can see him who is
[1:40:41] invisible. When that pulsating comes
[1:40:43] into your heart and begins to pulsate, I
[1:40:46] am the Lord who heals all thy diseases.
[1:40:49] When you can see that, everything else
[1:40:52] weakens away.
[1:40:55] Let me say, I can say amen to that. For
[1:40:58] when the Lord told me that Jessica would
[1:41:00] live and they put up the MRIs and they
[1:41:02] put up the CT scans, I said, "I don't
[1:41:04] care what it shows. I don't care what
[1:41:05] I'm looking at. I don't look at the MRI.
[1:41:08] I don't look at the CT scan. I look at
[1:41:10] what God said." He said she would live.
[1:41:12] Amen. And there's one thing about my
[1:41:14] God. He does not lie.
[1:41:21] Hallelujah.
[1:41:23] Hallelujah. And what happened to the
[1:41:26] walls of Jericho? They came down. Why?
[1:41:29] Because God said so.
[1:41:32] And the walls that Satan has built
[1:41:34] around your life and told you you'll
[1:41:35] never be no better and you'll never be
[1:41:37] no good and you'll never get over it.
[1:41:39] And all these things that's happened in
[1:41:40] your life, these walls, if you can look
[1:41:42] to him who gave the promise tonight,
[1:41:45] those walls can come down.
[1:41:48] And if you can believe what I'm telling
[1:41:49] you right now before the prayer line,
[1:41:51] you can start shouting the victory. You
[1:41:53] can start claiming the victory. You can
[1:41:55] start testifying right now.
[1:41:58] Cuz
[1:42:01] it's not my hands that'll heal you. It's
[1:42:03] not brother Matt's hands, brother Joel's
[1:42:05] hands. Come on, somebody. It's not our
[1:42:07] hands that'll do it. But it's faith in
[1:42:09] God's word.
[1:42:14] Moses brought the children of Israel all
[1:42:16] the way out of Egypt through that land.
[1:42:18] Came out of Egypt with two million
[1:42:21] people. And when they left Egypt, the
[1:42:24] Bible said there wasn't a feeble one
[1:42:27] among them. Yes sir. How for 40 years,
[1:42:32] how did he fight cancer, tuberculosis?
[1:42:36] How many babies was born overnight? How
[1:42:39] many tents did Dr. Moses have to visit?
[1:42:43] How many broken arms out there in that
[1:42:45] desert running around? How much
[1:42:47] pneumonia? How much malaria
[1:42:50] drank out of the ponds? Whatever they
[1:42:52] could get to, how much bacteria did they
[1:42:54] pick up? those germs and the things in
[1:42:56] the water.
[1:42:59] How did he keep two million people
[1:43:03] healthy?
[1:43:04] And the Bible said their clothes didn't
[1:43:08] even wear out.
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:12] How did he do that? What was his
[1:43:15] prescription when he left Egypt, the
[1:43:18] finest nation at that time? He never
[1:43:20] took one herb, not one essential oil.
[1:43:24] He never took one thing, not one of
[1:43:26] their tools, not one of their equipment.
[1:43:28] Come on. He never took that.
[1:43:31] They had the best doctors in the land.
[1:43:33] No doubt. They took care of Pharaoh, but
[1:43:35] he never took those doctors with him.
[1:43:40] What prescription did he use that worked
[1:43:43] on every case?
[1:43:45] You don't know what it was.
[1:43:48] I am the Lord that health all thy
[1:43:52] diseases.
[1:43:58] That's all he had. But that's all he
[1:44:01] needed. It worked then. It'll work now.
[1:44:04] It worked on it. It worked on every
[1:44:07] case. Then it'll work on every case
[1:44:09] tonight. I am the Lord thy God who heals
[1:44:12] all thy diseases.
[1:44:16] You are of God, little children.
[1:44:18] Overcome them because greater greater
[1:44:20] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:44:22] that's in the world. Greater is he. It's
[1:44:24] God the creator. The winds and the waves
[1:44:26] had to obey him. Demons become
[1:44:28] paralyzed. All nature obeyed him because
[1:44:30] he was the creator of nature. Oh, when
[1:44:33] we think of that, it takes a bite out of
[1:44:35] it. When you understand these things,
[1:44:36] you see what it is. It isn't man. Man
[1:44:38] can't do that. Man is a part of the
[1:44:40] creation, but it's the winds and waves
[1:44:42] that obey the creator.
[1:44:44] It takes the creator to do it. For he
[1:44:47] that is in you is greater than he that
[1:44:50] is in the world.
[1:44:52] He that causes turmoil, he that causes
[1:44:55] affliction, he that causes sickness,
[1:44:56] sorrow, death, cancer, that's he that's
[1:44:59] in the world,
[1:45:01] that's your enemy. But he that is in you
[1:45:06] is the creator
[1:45:08] who made the winds.
[1:45:11] He who made the winds is in this
[1:45:14] building tonight.
[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:18] He can rebuke the devil out of the winds
[1:45:20] and there's a calm. He can rebuke the
[1:45:21] devil out of the storm and there's no
[1:45:23] storm. He's the creator and greater is
[1:45:25] he that's in you than he that's in the
[1:45:28] world. If you find yourself struggling
[1:45:31] to believe that God can handle your
[1:45:33] circumstances, I invite you tonight to
[1:45:37] open your heart to him. Trust in his
[1:45:39] ability to do the impossible.
[1:45:46] If you don't know him, if you've never
[1:45:48] met him, I encourage you tonight, seek a
[1:45:50] relationship with Jesus Christ. Not an
[1:45:54] education of him. But a revelation of
[1:45:57] him, sir,
[1:46:00] a Jesus Christ who promises to never
[1:46:03] leave us nor forsake us. Remember, with
[1:46:07] God, nothing is too hard. Embrace the
[1:46:12] truth. Stand firm in your faith. And
[1:46:14] watch how God will work in your life.
[1:46:18] Amen. Anyone in the right mind knows
[1:46:20] that God can do all things. Can you say
[1:46:22] I'm closing? If he can't do all things,
[1:46:26] then he's not almighty God.
[1:46:30] Amen. If he can't do all things, he's no
[1:46:33] different than me. I can some things I
[1:46:34] can do.
[1:46:37] like saying brother Louie don't believe
[1:46:39] that but
[1:46:43] if he can't do all things then he's not
[1:46:45] almighty but if he is almighty God and I
[1:46:49] believe he is then he can do all things
[1:46:54] but the trouble of it tonight is people
[1:46:55] are looking for God millions of miles
[1:46:57] away when God is right here in the midst
[1:47:01] of us right now the one that you love
[1:47:04] the one that you serve is in this
[1:47:06] building tonight. For he spoke, "Where
[1:47:08] two or three are gathered in my name, I
[1:47:10] will be in their midst." And that's just
[1:47:13] as true as the rest of the scripture. As
[1:47:16] soon as you hear the word of God that
[1:47:17] says you can be set free, believe it.
[1:47:20] And rejoice with it. Amen. And God will
[1:47:24] show the evidence after you've accepted
[1:47:26] it. But first, you accept it. Christ
[1:47:30] died for sinners. I believe it. I accept
[1:47:31] it. I start rejoicing. God works
[1:47:34] righteousness by it. I believe by his
[1:47:37] stripes for my healing. I believe it. I
[1:47:39] accept it. And God works healing for me.
[1:47:41] See, just as soon as I believe it, he
[1:47:44] can't help me till I believe it. I've
[1:47:48] got to believe it and confess it first.
[1:47:49] And then God's under obligation to his
[1:47:52] word. Nothing is too hard for our Lord
[1:47:55] Jesus. He can do all things. He does all
[1:47:59] things well. Amen. What we need to do
[1:48:01] tonight is to take out after God's Holy
[1:48:04] Spirit and the pillar of fire and move
[1:48:05] into the promise of every divine promise
[1:48:07] in the Bible belongs to you. Every
[1:48:10] divine promise in the Bible belongs to
[1:48:12] you. It's your personal property. Amen.
[1:48:16] If you believe it. If you believe it.
[1:48:19] You know, some scholars say that there
[1:48:21] are close to 8,000 promises in the Bible
[1:48:25] and every one of them is yours.
[1:48:29] Thank you, Lord. Now, we are more than
[1:48:31] conquerors
[1:48:33] through Christ Jesus. Just walk into
[1:48:35] your inheritance. Listen to me. You are
[1:48:38] dealing with a defeated enemy. Brother
[1:48:40] Harry, come. Brothers, come. Listen to
[1:48:42] me now as we bring this down. We are
[1:48:45] dealing with a defeated enemy.
[1:48:50] Sickness is defeated. Amen. Death is
[1:48:53] defeated. Hell is defeated. Everything
[1:48:58] is defeated.
[1:49:00] We are disputing with a conquered enemy.
[1:49:04] Hallelujah. Well, brother Daryl, the
[1:49:06] devil said this and the devil said that
[1:49:07] and the devil told me this and the you
[1:49:10] are
[1:49:13] listening to a conquered enemy.
[1:49:17] He's defeated. Amen.
[1:49:21] Well, brother Daryl, you know,
[1:49:22] everything you said tonight is good, but
[1:49:24] you know, Brother Daryl,
[1:49:26] I'm just the least one here.
[1:49:30] I'm just the least one. I'm just the
[1:49:33] souls of his feet of the body of Christ.
[1:49:39] Well,
[1:49:41] I appreciate your humility,
[1:49:44] but you know, in reality,
[1:49:47] maybe that's who I am.
[1:49:49] Because a body's made up of many
[1:49:51] different things. I'm glad that my body
[1:49:53] is not all thumb.
[1:49:56] It's made up of many different members.
[1:49:58] And maybe that's exactly who I am is the
[1:50:01] souls of his feet in the body of Christ.
[1:50:04] Maybe you know where that little toe
[1:50:06] touches the bottom of the foot. That
[1:50:07] little crease right there.
[1:50:10] Ritty. Maybe that's who I am. Ready?
[1:50:18] You say, "Brother Bren, am I the least
[1:50:19] one?" That's the souls of his feet.
[1:50:23] But remember, he's triumphed with you.
[1:50:27] Triumphed over every bit of it. Every
[1:50:29] sickness, every devil, every power, even
[1:50:32] death itself is under your feet.
[1:50:37] That's the truth. It's under your feet.
[1:50:43] [Applause]
[1:50:44] You need to tell the devil, "Hey boy,
[1:50:47] you're under my feet.
[1:50:52] Whatever that thing is is bothering you,
[1:50:54] you need to stomp it down. You need to
[1:50:56] stomp it down because every devil, every
[1:51:00] demon, come on, somebody, they are under
[1:51:03] your feet.
[1:51:06] If I can just get you to see that the
[1:51:09] church will be triumphed. There'll not
[1:51:11] be a feeble one among us tonight.
[1:51:16] Hallelujah.
[1:51:18] When I was a young preacher, I preached
[1:51:21] with all my heart that Jesus opened the
[1:51:23] eyes of the blind and he made the lame
[1:51:25] walk. I believed it, but I never
[1:51:28] witnessed it. But I believed it.
[1:51:33] When my daughter was blind,
[1:51:37] they told me
[1:51:39] she'll never swallow again. She'll never
[1:51:42] speak again. She'll never walk again.
[1:51:44] She'll never see again. She'll never
[1:51:46] swallow again. If she even lives, she'll
[1:51:48] be nothing but a vegetable.
[1:51:52] And I went to this little room that I'd
[1:51:54] go to just to get out from under it and
[1:51:56] lay my head against that wall. And I'd
[1:51:58] cry out to God. I said, "God, I don't
[1:52:00] want my baby to be blind. I don't want
[1:52:02] my baby to be blind.
[1:52:08] And I remembered
[1:52:10] the prophet said, "God has provided a
[1:52:13] lamb."
[1:52:17] And I started telling her, Jessica,
[1:52:20] you'll see me again. He said, "Brother,
[1:52:22] I've heard that and I've heard that. I
[1:52:23] know, but I promise God that I would I
[1:52:26] would try my best to tell the world what
[1:52:28] he done for her.
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:33] I'd say, "Jessica, do you see me?" She'd
[1:52:35] say, "No, daddy. I can't see." I said,
[1:52:36] "But you'll see me again. You will see
[1:52:39] me again. God provided a lamp for your
[1:52:41] eyes."
[1:52:45] And I can stand here tonight and tell
[1:52:46] you friends, when I say God opens the
[1:52:48] blinded eyes, it's not wishful thinking.
[1:52:50] I know that. I know that. I know because
[1:52:52] I saw my God when the doctor said
[1:52:55] there's no way. But I'm here tonight to
[1:52:57] say there is nothing that's too hard for
[1:52:59] my God. for my God. Open her blinded
[1:53:02] eyes and tonight. Hallelujah. She sees
[1:53:06] better than me. And not only can she
[1:53:08] see, but she can walk. And I can stand
[1:53:10] there and tell you, there is nothing O D
[1:53:13] H I N G. There is nothing that my God
[1:53:17] cannot do. Do you believe it tonight?
[1:53:20] Then stand to your feet and give him
[1:53:22] praise.
[1:53:25] Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] Hallelujah.
[1:53:31] Hallelujah.
[1:53:36] Cast all your cares upon him for he
[1:53:39] cares for you. Here's what I want you to
[1:53:42] do. When you come through the line
[1:53:44] tonight, whatever it is that's
[1:53:45] afflicting you, I want you to cast it
[1:53:47] upon your provided lamb tonight and take
[1:53:50] his promise and go out that door
[1:53:53] rejoicing just as happy as you can be,
[1:53:55] telling people that you're heal healed.
[1:53:58] Go and testify.
[1:54:02] If you believe in healing and you
[1:54:04] believe God has healed you, then confess
[1:54:06] it and God will make your body obey your
[1:54:10] confession.
[1:54:13] Do you believe that tonight?
[1:54:16] Hallelujah.
[1:54:17] Hallelujah. Sing it bel turned into
[1:54:20] wine. He opened the eyes. Amen.
[1:54:25] Hallelujah.
[1:54:28] Hallelujah.
[1:54:33] Turn into wine.
[1:54:38] Open the eyes of the blind.
[1:54:41] There's no one like you.
[1:54:47] There's none like you.
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:54] Into the darkness you shine.
[1:54:59] Oh, out of the ashes we rise. There's no
[1:55:04] one like you.
[1:55:09] There's none like you.
[1:55:16] Our God is gater.
[1:55:19] Our God is stronger.
[1:55:22] God you are higher than any other.
[1:55:27] Our God is healer. He's awesome in
[1:55:31] power. Our God
[1:55:34] our God.
[1:55:38] Our God is gater.
[1:55:40] Our God is stronger.
[1:55:43] God you are higher than any other.
[1:55:48] Our God is heer. Awesome in power. Our
[1:55:54] God.
[1:55:56] Our God.
[1:55:59] Water. You turn into wine.
[1:56:04] You open the eyes of the blood. There's
[1:56:09] no one like you. Like you, Lord. There's
[1:56:14] none like you.
[1:56:19] Oh,
[1:56:21] our God is gater.
[1:56:23] Our God is stronger.
[1:56:26] God, you are higher than any other.
[1:56:31] Our God is here.
[1:56:34] Awesome power. Our God.
[1:56:39] Our God. Oh,
[1:56:42] our God.
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:45] Our God is stronger. Stronger. You are
[1:56:48] higher than any
[1:56:53] God. Hallelujah. Awesome power of God.
[1:57:00] Our God.
[1:57:04] And if our God is for us, then who could
[1:57:08] stop us? And if our God is with us, then
[1:57:12] what can stand? Who can stand against
[1:57:15] us? If our God is for us, then who can
[1:57:19] stop us? And if our God is with us, then
[1:57:23] who can stand again?
[1:57:28] If stop us and if our God is with us,
[1:57:33] then what can stand against?
[1:57:39] Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] Our God is gater. Our God is stronger.
[1:57:45] God, you are higher than any other. Our
[1:57:51] God is Jesus. You are awesome in power.
[1:57:55] Our God.
[1:57:58] Our God.
[1:58:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:58:06] How many believes it? Hallelujah.
[1:58:10] Hallelujah.
[1:58:13] Praise the Lord. You can be seated for
[1:58:15] just a just a moment if you will.
[1:58:19] We'll ask all the minister brothers that
[1:58:20] wish to help us pray. If you'd come up
[1:58:22] and line up here in the front, the
[1:58:24] deacon brothers will help you. We'll
[1:58:26] form the prayer line and it'll come back
[1:58:28] this way and come to the right hand
[1:58:31] side. We'll have two lines of of
[1:58:33] ministers. One here and one on that
[1:58:35] side, please.
[1:58:37] Also, we'd like to say for those that
[1:58:40] maybe want to be prayed for and you have
[1:58:42] a child that you're going to have to
[1:58:43] carry the child or maybe the child needs
[1:58:45] prayer and the elderly and maybe those
[1:58:48] that aren't feeling well would like to
[1:58:50] have them to come first because they
[1:58:53] might be the ones that would be a little
[1:58:55] bit more difficult for them to stand and
[1:58:57] wait in line. So, the elderly, those
[1:59:00] that have children, or those that aren't
[1:59:03] feeling very well, if you can't make it
[1:59:06] up here, we certainly will come and pray
[1:59:07] for you.
[1:59:10] I believe with all of my heart, our
[1:59:14] God's going to do mighty things.
[1:59:18] I know friends and I realize it it's
[1:59:20] kind of moving in our ranks that people
[1:59:23] are looking for a word from the Lord for
[1:59:26] a preacher and they're kind of waiting
[1:59:28] to see if you got something for me or
[1:59:30] something for me or something for me.
[1:59:33] Well, let me give you several words from
[1:59:36] the Lord tonight.
[1:59:39] If you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:59:42] you, ask what you will. Amen. Delight
[1:59:46] thyself also in the Lord, and he will
[1:59:48] give thee the desires of thine heart. If
[1:59:50] any two on earth agree, touch in
[1:59:52] anything, it shall be done. You have
[1:59:56] asked nothing in my name, hitherto ask
[2:00:00] that you might receive. They shall lay
[2:00:03] hands on the sick and they shall
[2:00:06] recover. You need more words than that.
[2:00:09] Your name is written all over them. So
[2:00:12] whether you need healing or you need
[2:00:14] deliverance of something that you're
[2:00:16] dealing with a besetting sin or if you
[2:00:19] need the Holy Ghost, the prophet has
[2:00:21] taught us the apostolic way of receiving
[2:00:24] the Holy Ghost is for men of God to lay
[2:00:27] hands on you. Amen. So whatever you have
[2:00:30] need of, you say, "Well, I don't need to
[2:00:31] come through the prayer line. I've got
[2:00:32] perfect faith." Praise the Lord. That's
[2:00:34] wonderful. But you know what? We're
[2:00:37] doing this tonight for those who want to
[2:00:39] come through. Nobody has to, but for
[2:00:42] those who want to come through. And
[2:00:44] before we start it, we just like to pray
[2:00:45] together. And we want you to pray for
[2:00:47] the ministers, of course. And it might
[2:00:49] seem odd and unusual to you when
[2:00:51] preachers go to pray for people and you
[2:00:53] watch them and they get so weak and all
[2:00:55] and you say, "I don't understand that."
[2:00:57] Well, maybe you wouldn't unless you've
[2:00:58] stood there. But Brother Bram didn't
[2:01:01] understand it either. As a matter of
[2:01:02] fact, I shared a quote today with some
[2:01:04] of the brothers. Brother Bram said that
[2:01:06] he would get weak when people would come
[2:01:07] through and he didn't understand it. And
[2:01:09] a brother told him, he said, "Brother
[2:01:10] Brennham," he said, "it's strength going
[2:01:13] out of you." And he said, "I didn't even
[2:01:15] understand that's what it was."
[2:01:18] Preachers can control the fervor by
[2:01:21] which they pray. They have the ability
[2:01:23] to regulate that somewhat. They can be
[2:01:26] able to control uh how they minister
[2:01:30] out. But what you can't control is this.
[2:01:34] when people come up for prayer and they
[2:01:37] pull out of you.
[2:01:41] So you might pray for 150 or 200,
[2:01:44] whatever it would be, and you'll be
[2:01:46] fine. And all of a sudden, one person
[2:01:48] walks up and by their faith, they reach
[2:01:52] inside of you and depletes you of
[2:01:55] everything you've got. A preacher has no
[2:01:57] control of that.
[2:02:00] So we're going to pray together. We're
[2:02:02] going to pray for you all. We want you
[2:02:03] to pray for the brothers. We have many
[2:02:05] needs and things at church tonight.
[2:02:07] Diseases and sicknesses and afflictions.
[2:02:10] And
[2:02:11] we're going to have a lot of prayer
[2:02:12] cloths once this is over as well. And
[2:02:15] anybody that's streaming tonight that
[2:02:16] couldn't be here and you want a prayer
[2:02:18] cloth, we'll send you that as well.
[2:02:22] Heavenly Father,
[2:02:25] we believe that you are here.
[2:02:28] And if you are here, you're here to do
[2:02:30] the impossible.
[2:02:32] Your prophet has taught us where God is.
[2:02:36] Supernatural things take place. None of
[2:02:39] us are a prophet. We don't desire to be.
[2:02:42] We just want to be what you've made us
[2:02:44] to be. Lord, your servants. We're here
[2:02:47] to offer prayer for your children. Lord,
[2:02:50] the battles, the sicknesses, the
[2:02:52] afflictions. Maybe some of them need the
[2:02:54] Holy Ghost. You know what they need
[2:02:56] tonight. Lord, these brothers are
[2:02:59] praying and the saints of God are
[2:03:01] praying.
[2:03:02] We pray for the singers. We pray for the
[2:03:04] musicians that you just anoint them,
[2:03:07] Lord. May they create an atmosphere in
[2:03:10] this place. May the miraculous power of
[2:03:13] God come down and move among us, Lord.
[2:03:17] Lord, if there's one person healed, one
[2:03:20] person delivered, one person receives
[2:03:23] the Holy Ghost, that honor does not go
[2:03:25] to any preacher, that honor goes to you,
[2:03:29] Lord. Come and manifest yourself among
[2:03:32] us, Lord God. We've seen you do so many
[2:03:35] wonderful, awesome things. Come and
[2:03:39] prove your word this night, Father, in
[2:03:43] the name of Jesus.
[2:03:46] Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. Those
[2:03:49] of you that want to be prayed for, you
[2:03:50] can just come and line up around the
[2:03:52] wall there. And
[2:03:55] Hallelujah.
[2:03:58] Hallelujah.
[2:04:02] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:04:06] Brothers,
[2:04:09] healing
[2:04:10] is here.

[3:37:58] He came up and pulled up his pants leg
[3:38:00] and he had a diabetic ulcer that had
[3:38:01] ate. I could see the bone through the
[3:38:04] wound and he's going to amputate his
[3:38:06] leg. and I preached on the bride's
[3:38:08] checkbook and he said, "Brother Daryl, I
[3:38:11] want to write a check for my leg." So,
[3:38:14] we prayed for the brother.
[3:38:17] About a few months later, I was back
[3:38:18] down there. The brother come running up
[3:38:21] to me and pulled up his pants leg. His
[3:38:23] leg was completely healed.
[3:38:28] [Music]
[3:38:32] The only
[3:38:34] the only thing on his leg was a was a
[3:38:36] dark spot where the ulcer had been. And
[3:38:39] he said, "Brother, I went to the doctor
[3:38:40] and the doctor said, "What did you do?
[3:38:42] Tell us what you did and we'll tell
[3:38:44] these other people who's got these
[3:38:45] ulcers that's going to lose their legs."
[3:38:47] He said, "I told him I wrote a check to
[3:38:49] Jesus."

[3:39:14] tonight in the prayer line. It it just
[3:39:16] takes a lot out of you. But sometimes

[3:39:23] and we thank you brothers for laboring
