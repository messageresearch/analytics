brother Matt Watkins made this statement I might be wrong he was a minister I heard here not too long ago the scriptures that says that a dog would return to its vomit a South to its wallah and you

well we're exciting today brother Chisholm was excited here last night we're just gonna follow him we're not turning back we're just gonna keep following brother Terry we're just gonna go on that's right amen when we got just about three requests if you just remain standing with me this morning while we look at them but the Carter Lawson says to remember Harlan in prayers just turned three very sick one remember that request also has an unspoken prayer request that the Lord knows all about dis committed unto the Lord sister Brenda Harmon sister Rachel traveling mercies they are in Indiana going that way so let's remember them in prayer that the Lord would be mindful of them give them probably the mercy brother Joel Moyer sends this in to please remember us in prayer court dates coming

in prayer he goes in for radiation treatment for prostate cancer pray for all the doctors that God would just guide them pray for all the situation the legalities and the things they're going through that God would just be mindful of them we believe he's able to take care of that situation whatever it is we're just committed unto the Lord you have an unspoken prayer request this morning something you like for this group to pray we're at where the West come this morning take us to the Lord in prayer let's just commit these things unto God as we pray over these prayer requests this morning we like this guy right here don't we hey you meant um forgive me if I'm wrong about who it was but I think it was I think it was Khrushchev whenever he would even speak in their version of Parliament or Congress whatever it is they have over there in Russia they were so afraid of him he had so much power and they were so afraid of him that nobody wanted to be the last one or the first one to quit clapping when he would come into the room they would stand there and they would clap and clap and clap and they were scared to death to be the first one to stop because they were so afraid of this man I'm rather Lully this morning was asking us to give a hand clap or praise I was thinking we serve a God who loves us so much who gave us everything who humbled himself when he didn't have to down to the lowest of us to save us to to show us his kindness to show us his mercy and His grace and and you know I didn't it's overwhelming when we clap it's worship we don't we don't want to stop because we love Him not because we're afraid he'll strike us down if we quit we're so fortunate to be the people of God we're so fortunate to have the revelation we've got you know even even when the devil comes against us as hard as he can when he when he brings the blindfold the sickness against us and discouragement and just tries to wail on to some beat us down when he tries to put that blindfold on us and blind us from our faith all of our senses tell us that that he's not there that he doesn't love us that he doesn't care everything within us cries out saying where are you God where are you but but that seat down inside of us at faith that he gave us it reaches out and it says blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord let's bow before our God Lord Jesus we love you we love you we don't doubt you we don't doubt you for one second Lord we love you with all of our heart we come here this morning to worship you to praise you in truth Lord Oh Lord God we just love how

prayer requests up before you in faith believing we know they will be taken care of Lord we know that you'll be glorified even if the man who is sick and has not seen his healing yet stands with his arms outstretched and says blessed be the name of the Lord we know that that worship will bring about change we know that healing is just over the horizon Lord we know that no matter what we ask of

name Church say a man a man while you standing we just turn in our Bibles a man prays that Almighty God we just turned a man praise the Lord we first of all we go to the Book of Numbers a man the 13 chapter and we read a potion that we're going to skip over and I'm trying to do this not going to read the whole thing but trying to this show a platform and which direction we are going numbers the 13th chapter and we read from 1 to verse 4 amen then we go over to the 14th chapter that would be all right a man numbers 13 and 1 and it reads and the Lord the Lord now spake unto Moses saying send out means that they may search the land of Canaan a man keynote was a type of the Holy Ghost Cana was not the type of the millennium because when it was in Cana that still def sought in over a period of time so Canaan types the Holy Ghost with we have the Holy Ghost but we still have to go through Wars and that's right send out means that they may search the land of Canaan was I given unto the children of Israel of every tribes of their fathers shall ye sent a man everyone a ruler among them and Moses by the commandment of the Lord I want you to know that amen this wasn't Moses idea that wasn't Moses chosen but God told Moses to call these means and Moses by the commandment of the Lord sent them from the wilderness of Paran and all those men were head of the children of Israel these men are the tribe of Reuben Simeon and Judas and it goes on these men were great leaders these these men's was meant that the congregation look up Jew when these men walk up to the podium people gave them great respect people Reavis them because they knew that they was men of God a man that was recognized amongst a congregation he was man well-spoken of these great men's Moses chose them by God they chose this man to go into the Promised Land amen now we return to right over to the fourteenth chapter and we read from 1 to verse 8 right quick amen amen after they went to the promised land and they got back a report and from this report it discomfort the church members it gotten so discouraged amen it was so bad and too many of the church members went back into the thing that they destroy if that's right amen numbers the 14th chapter and all the congregation lift up their voice and cried and the people wept that night oh it was terrible and all the children of Israel mummer against Moses they started finding faults and errors and he was off on their saying it was off on that against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would that God we had died in the land of Egypt air for what you say out of your mouth death in life is in the power of your tongue you see a lot of time Chris and they speak doubt and they can't get no further you got to speak things as don't care hide it badly you've got to learn how to train your mouth how to speak positive we are a positive people we got a positive message I don't care how bad it looks we got to speak thus saith the Lord we got to be like the woman a man that had a dead baby she'd say all this well my my my y'all got to help me where did I live four five I was getting ready to leave this place bless the Lord where are we to third mine and let's do two again the second verse and all the children of Israel memories against Moses and against Aaron can you believe this all that they've seen the congregation said oh oh the Concord said unto them would that God we had died in each ceg was a type of the world or an organization Oh would that God we had died in this wilderness oh that's spoken and therefore has the Lord brought us into this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prayer where it's not better for us to return back to the nominations I mean we do better when we was in the Pentecostal church we didn't have all this confusion we didn't we didn't have all them different different quotes and this quote man we were much better where we was in there in the system with someone in choir and nobody bothered us that that's what they're saying why isn't sure and they said one to another let us make us let us make us a captain and let us return let us make us a captain return unto the world I'm suffered to mothers and that's true minute trial there's no way a Christian go through all this I mean I I come up to the altar and brother Donnie prayed for me and I'm struggling but this can't be the will of God I'm going back to the world and there ain't nobody Church love me so we start thinking that way you start thinking don't be spirits bothering with you somebody say man you got to help me out where am i and they say it one to another let us make us a captain and let them return let us return into Egypt and then Moses then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembled of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb that church they made a son of Jesse on which were of them that searched the land rip their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land we pass through to search it is an exceedingly good land this one want to draw my taste from it's the Lord delighting us then he will bring us until this land and give it us and the land which floor with milk and honey let's buy head again Lord we thank you for the reading of your word now sanctify to our souls and Jesus name the church see man a man you may be seated a man from those passes of Scripture we would like to just draw a takes a man by the help of the Lord birth some I'm a very simple man you don't need much of a pen so a man is I'm just a simple old country preacher you know I I was amazed when I when I found that brother Donnie and invite me to come here and that you know and I and I had you on a pedestal but I found out that y'all just common folks you know you know the Bible said the Bible said the common people heard him planning so that makes me feel a little more at home Amen so we realize they made my my thought is delight yourself in the Lord delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart if you will you turn with me before Amen we go on with this mess is a man if you look at where he meant David begin to write and and and Saul's a man 37 and verse 3 and he reads trust in the Lord and do good no matter what folks do to you you do good a man that what the prophet of God said that last day church they will return blessings instead of hate instead of cursing Amen why because they trust in the Lord and do good so should i dwell in the land and ronnied I shall be fed Oh My isn't we being fed easily being fed aim and a dance there's no flaw in this hey man I don't know what folks talking about I don't know what core and Dathan talking about I haven't found no fault with this are you hearing me everything I read been good somebody say man and the baby was saying they didn't like thyself in the Lord and he shall not he might but he shall mine he shall give thee the desires of the heart my let's this holy there he's again now they are I think was Valen Amen we be like a offer tower Oh be like all our Bishop be like offer Balaam a certain amount of money man he goes round them a big chick if you could just go out there and catch those Brides members if you could just go out there and do your Lilian chant man amen get them to a place when it started getting cold - Walter message if you could just do anything to slow down and I can imagine Balaam went out there and he did all his Lilian chant minute he did all that little stuff ain't man and you know what the children kept praising God hey man the children kept worshiping God they come to church with a wheelchair but it still with praising God someone would come with crutches but it was still praising God and you know what Balaam say bailet oh I'll be like salute this thing just ain't working and be like God and be like got upset look here now I normally I paid you and you can handle this job but Balaam told him he said look God is not a man that each alive neither he the son of man that he shall repent if God ever speaks something God can't lie that's that's what keeps me going because my Lord promised me there will be a rapture oh god promises true better yet the Apostle Paul said in Thessalonians he said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel we're not looking for that promise it has already come and we are part of that promise I'm not looking for a shop I'm not looking for a boy we are the voice in a day now the dead in Christ it's going to rise first and we that alive and remain a man you know a lot of folks they're looking for they meant that prayer direction but let me tell you you got to be a part of the resurrection you got to be a part of the shouts are you hearing me you got to be excited to see my loss you've got to be looking for him if you're not looking for him then you're not going to see him that word did like me pleasing somebody someone that's greatly great pleasure happy see delight and I said Lord is it okay for me to title if the Lord if you said today know if in the bride where Paul said if that spirit if that spirit that raised Christ from the day if that spirit but if that spirit if that spirit if so in other words that's a possibility that spirit may not be there that's why I say that's very that raised Christ from the day if that's varied welling you it's going to quicken you what do you think it's quicken you it's a reveal word of the hour not what Luther preached not what TD jakes freeze not what tommy here or in adults it's the message of the hour it's healed the bride rapture faith it give us quickening power so another word how st. Lord would it be okay for me to title this this the law so what Joshua was saying y'all be quiet be quiet that they brought back an e report John Sakata said be quiet you're in the presence of the Prophet you say you say I'm not afraid of the Prophet I could tell so but the Bible say he didn't receive a prophet in the name of a prophet receive a proper reward I want to know what the proper reward here I think it's a body change you know I talked about last night about feeding the garbage how he likes to hide he fitted that garment let me tell you the prophet of God said when you was born there's a theophany that goes on with you you know then I want a son but the devil just so like me you know what I hate him I hate the Dell birds and every one of his deals I come to slap in the name of Jesus someone said brother Jill you talkin to be you might well don't be afraid stand up and be accounted for stand up and say we are more than able oh my god up in the states at night you don't believe this don't say man be quiet cuz somebody gonna come knocking at your door and it won't be me cuz I'm going back down side but I'm what I'm going to tell you if this is true you say man if it don't a man put your hand over your mouth Satan it's like a dishrag no no we sound like a blowing speaker so somebody are you saying no but that's alright oh you said brother chill you talking about a well let me tell you what all of God's sons are positive I hear me they know negative in us we speak positive man we speak faith we matter of fact we create world and go live in it you don't have to walk around and feed it you'll have to walk around with your head down create an atmosphere and go step in joy that's what this mess is come to do it's time to give you my the churching big enough I need some room y'all spread out the way you know we tell you what God willing to do God will somebody God will somebody with some faith in this out to raise up is it not I'll be a tonic I need some I need some room up here I didn't feel like praising look let me tell you what you got that you say brother chill you talking my to be can I meet the devil man some more he's gonna fight anyhow so that's all right amen the disciples was was beating and slapping kick and it was strictly command don't you ever preach that name again they were physically beat a man but let me tell you what that's why Paul said put on the whole armor of God you know what the armor of God is it's the baptism of the Holy go make sure you got the shield of faith that could block every fiery talks of the devil but I feel like preaching now when the enemy comes in like a flood the Bible said that the Spirit of the Lord will live up a stand that somebody say man you got to live your faith and say I am heal if the Lord in the Lord not worth what Johnson is saying he said Caleb look brother we could take the land we got a quite nice congregation down he said now what has happened we beat this and the thing about it Moses God told Moses God told Moses supposes I want you to get 12 mins I I hadn't read I didn't read what the problem say but God in his mind he knew 10 on was fake you know they walk around and they had these strobes and they could read and laws and their bylaws amen but there was just as false that they could be but really you couldn't tell amen they look real good before the people and they knew how to presa they know how to read that stroller you say oh my god I sure that got to be a man of God that's why you got to have the spirit of the deserve it the discernment is in the bride I'm gonna say something now I'm gonna challenge you if I was a devil about 10 of you is already that I'm pick it up huh that's right that's right hey man you can't come up we're now now you deserted everything amen I believe this with all my heart I'm not afraid to tell you Amen if this message is wrong not a bunch of tapes quote but the message is Christ wrong I'm lost I'm not afraid to say if this wrong I'm lost you remember I got rid of my television is this wrong I'm I me my wife my would get in a car and we just ride just ride so we've ran out of gas and just go somewhere and watch a big hell of vision and just just just enjoy life cuz we lost sinner how just this do what you got to do and that's what a lot of folks fear but let me tell you I got one thing inside of me it's pressing power oh my and Joshua Moses saying no I would try to go down there God told Moses that night God want you to get 12 men of east try and Moses that the word got around I don't know they takes it off I got around by the word or they Google and a higher bar it got around but it got around to all of the tribes and mine you could you could you imagine a mentor tribe from Benjamin they got up in the and Judah and all these different means got up and it felt good [Applause] Moses called me but Moses called me I'm going down there said I don't know what the profit motive but I feel we're good and matter-of-fact brother the whole the congregation saw when Moses Illinois to me that he got nothing to do with it I don't care how much enough mode let me tell you Jesus when he chose his twelve disciples he said one of you are the devil and Judas did miracles so I ain't thinking about your miracles somebody say man I'm watching that life and you can't live that life unless Christ be inside you the Bible said that he gave you the desires of your heart let me tell you God knows your heart we might look like a Christian and say I love everybody but God looking right through your heart that's why the proper God says in the same social circle of is it so he turned his microphone off he said sister you shouldn't have come up here like this and even whisper he said I deal with you later but you shouldn't come up there up here like that that's why when he come to town folks going fasting and prayer and seeking God but let me tell you what a man he might have winning the grade but that ministry is going on with the bride somebody say man the discernment is in the bra God is raising up a minutes in his hour and I can see some of those trials them tribes they met or there was happiness you know there must have stood before the kind of get oh they get the crowd was much bigger than this and I can magic Moses my to call them my from the trial of Dan from the tribe of Edom and then brother sitting up there [Music] one whispered tada what we're going to do we gonna start us at 80 minutes we gonna get to spread out and then this standard down a man hey man but it was getting ready to go it meant down there a man despite the land and I cannot magic when it went down there they know they knew within their heart they knew they were fake you know that's a bad thing to be sitting in church and knowing your colors gonna show oh yeah you gonna show the best thing you can do is just leave cuz you gonna show we had the top of the be me and you can't climb you is afraid of height you coming down it's too now you can't you gotta walk straight up there you've got to be louder walk up there and my I can see I can see them brothers going down there and Joshua Kayla now there was something different about Joshua and Caleb they had another spirit let me help you tell you the truth Johnson Caleb came from that eternal spirit Joshu cater came from the might of God and Joshua came before God even thought about Satan or Lucifer Jiaxuan kinga was in his mind somebody saved man man Joshua Keadle name was on the lam book of life is that right I could imagine him brothers they may I could imagine my day a man to all them day they got the Stroh's and oh my day they got all these information it may look a real good before the people real good it's just packing all this and that he man it got old and then when they got down there see now if you notice here let's turn here I'm just I'm just falling low let's turn to Exodus the 3rd chapter a man Exodus a man Exodus when it was coming out of Egypt not look what God told them it man this wasn't Moses that said this this was God God can't lie Exodus 3 and verse 6 and it read I'm over here he said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the god of Isaac a God of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God now this was God speaking in a different form a man God from the turn of Spirit a man when God took on a form the low gods that came out of God and God was that color fire that stood before Moses here in Moses look Moses couldn't even look in his face now this was God talking to Moses this wasn't a quote that Moses read this was God verse 7 and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people are in Egypt and they in other word God said I see those folks in those system a man those my people in those systems and that's what he said but he said if my people that are called by my name if they were humming themself seek my face and turn from their wicked way then I'll yield their land you know what a lot of lands in he'll cut people ain't turning now let me share something with you while I'm thinking of this young a pardon me I'm just falling the Holy Spirit would that be all right hey man I just thought of this right here a man the property God made a statement right here he says I will get back to accident-free man to Lord's will but look coming out of Egypt not eaten as I said Egypt was a type of the world or an organization now you've got many of the children of Israel he may came out of Egypt but when they come out of Egypt they come out of Egypt are you hearing me when it left Egypt was a type of justification are you with me they went through Red Sea was a type of sanctification sanctification is clean and set

talk to her when you first met hi I don't know I don't know the youngest marriage in here but I remember 34 going on 35 years ago I remember where my defect I don't think we had to well my wife and I we might have had telephone a man we come up real poor a man but I think we had a telephone but you don't have folks we need love a man there on the phone and it talks for hours but now since they might know he talked to one another sit at the table for hours nobody say nothing but when we first got mouth you just you just you don't see her she don't see you sit there how you doing I'm doing good that's why I get quite knowing that you here are you still there yeah I'm still there are you tired no I'm not tired you know I love you that's that's how this breathing this this lives the not this just love just breathing awful love but let me tell you what and that's what's happening when you come to cry sometimes you don't even hear his boy but I could just hear him breathe on me Lord just breathe on me I know you there oh my oh my oh my amen and when they came in for the congregation they brought back a report and the Bible said when they brought back in the report that Bible said that they'd say Moses the land is just is slowly making honey but we cannot take it and it kind of gets to say oh so so what you say Moses lied to us you meet so Moses lied to us and I've heard some of the brothers say we got some quotes we assure you after after service we got some quotes in here weh-weh was off we got some quotes where he said 16 men fell off the bridge we searched the records it wasn't nowhere to be fine I got good news for you in construction for 34 years I worked on a construction job some years ago and there was a man on an i-beam early in the morning why the dude was still on the i-beam he was up there demanding his guys to go out there early in the morning with the dew was on the beam they didn't want to go out there he called him a bunch of chickens a bunch of sissies and he said I'll go out there and put that steel together and he walked out there and he fall down to his death and let me tell you what I walked by this man saw him laying on the ground I looked at the man with my own eyes laying on the ground and it was command everybody to leave the jobsite and when he fell I looked like go I could see his members I'd see that his team-mate crying because he thought he was too good to go out there and he fell to his death but that night that night they gave them the wife a sudden my two daughters to keep it quiet are you hearing me but that night I went news they said two men up on me a man on the job Herbert Jurgen and so-and-so fell between two safety net brother I saw with my own wife that wasn't a safety net no way around so you mean to tell me when the prophets say he saw sixteen men fell you think that company would have let that out you think they would have let that out I don't know i had--my ever been to Charleston you see that big bridge when you cross over just been built a few years ago I cross that bridge I have a little part of it let me tell you what there was means wide it was pouring concrete there was man that was out of town there was man that wasn't look up to but at nighttime the crane operator say he heard means when he fell in the water but they kept on pouring that concrete they say no records of it just keep it quiet so you think when the Prophet said God showed him 16 that's what he saw and that's what I believe I believe the report I believe the report can I can I give you one more can I give you one thought I'm going to show you hot dog amen cuddles me discomfort the people ha it got so bad until they say you know what we would that we stayed in Egypt Paul said in Galatians 2 and 18 amen if I build again the things that I discard I make it myself for what a transgressor I was on the job bless the Lord I know God word is real but see there's a darkness you know somebody say brother children don't touch your little saying that people don't need to know that if you got a Internet you already seen it five six years ago we might want to talk about but it's everywhere but I want to tell to believe us amen we got our eyes on one thing and there's a rap shot there there's a catch aware of the church a man I'm not going to die what moves has told us Moses say the land was falling making honey and joseline Kayla said we gonna fight every inch of the way we going all the way we fought over vision and the land was flowing with milk and honey brother I'm sure how real this race one day I was in my study I was on the job and I was getting ready to preach a message I sent me go and look at in 19 and 33 on the Ohio River Bridge are you oh are you with me and in my study I need to get some inspiration kind of when I read something a man I could see what the Prophet said I'm Sheamus you don't do it that's your Bend as a man but he was my property man he wasn't my Savior he didn't die for me amen but Jesus died for me but he was Malachi 4 and brother I was sitting at my death trying to get an inspiration and I said I believe I'll just type and I type in the Ohio River Bridge and when I did that to my surprise brother seemed like it got dark on me and none to my surprise it was so that he wasn't even out there are you with me he wasn't even out there matter of fact some of the people wasn't out there like he said yeah say my god is that true I said Lord this can't be and you know what I got away from my computer and I brother I got out my I got into my golf car and I rolled down to another section that's oh my god and seeing that doctor was covering over me let me tell you what unbelief has a darkness with it a man you got to be tough in this out if you're not built to take it in this hour the best thing you do is this hit the altar because their Lord I need a Holy Ghost in the south to meet the challenge of the devil brother I got alone to myself and I knew I had something that need to be taken care that day and I was trusting God I would be with what God said but probably God said if you take it and put it in the acts of 19 child it'll come to pass oh my god what like 19 chapter got to do with that if he said I believe it but that day I saw him a golf car and the darkness was coming over me that devil says see you believe in all this Amen you believe in all that so all that stuff be real it's just like a man with them 12 when I'm teeing came back with the evil report all that ain't true that's a god you got to help me I said lord I believe
