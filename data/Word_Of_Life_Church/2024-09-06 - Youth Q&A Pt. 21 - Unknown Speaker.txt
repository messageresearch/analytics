understand him better we know that we can only be able to really serve him with all the sincerity of our hearts is when we know more about him and understand his character and his nature what he wants of us and sometimes why he wants it sometimes he's gracious to us and lets us know I want it this way because because because other times he doesn't he just tells us and he wants us to trust him but I'm so grateful that he's allowed us this privilege again um we'll pick up on the last question that we had and I'm sorry that we had to cancel a couple and I wasn't able to be here um but we'll resume where we were can you explain why brother brandham is a Vindicated prophet and why the message is correct I have a difficult time speaking to why I believe what I believe we're going to pray how many have a need on your heart tonight a request all right Lord Jesus we've gathered here again tonight for the opportunity and for the privilege that's been given to us at hand and we're coming with Thanksgiving first of all that we have this opportunity Lord God we realize that we have many brothers and sisters around the world they cannot meet on Wednesday night Thursday night they have to rent a school they have to hire a facility as they call it they can only get that fac facility whenever it's available what they would give to be able to meet on any given night of the week and we want you to know we are grateful for that opportunity we don't want to come to this place that you've given us and just say well so what it's this is way everybody does but in reality it's not many of your children Lord God they don't even have a church to go to they live here and there and there and miles away from a church I get emails from them all the time of people from around the world that would just love to come and make a visit just to be in the house of God so I pray that we wouldn't take it for granted Lord help me tonight Lord Jesus that I can get out of the way this is an important question for us and we seek understanding from you speak to us tonight father we pray in the name of Jesus amen God bless you you can be be seated to us um looking at prophets and talking about prophets Is Not Unusual it's um it's very normal to us to probably lots of Christians it would be one of the biggest stumbling blocks that they would hear um I'm sure that you've noticed it since we've been in here over a year now in February that we've had so many visitors that have come through I figured it would be that way people just curious trying to figure out who we are what we are they've heard all kinds of things about us so they're going to come and check us out and some come one time they never come back some come two or three times they never come back but it's always amazing to me that whenever you go to preach the message and then if we'll throw a quote up on the screen sh behind me I've seen several of those people in the year and half whatever it is that we've been here that whenever you go to doing that they get to a little pocket book and their song book and whatever and hit that door they're out of here they think oh my goodness what kind of church is this but I try to understand you know where they're coming from and yet many of the churches where they've gone to uh you can hear radio preachers do it all the time television preachers they'll quote from Charles Spurgeon they'll quote from M from Moody they'll quote from all types of other men why because they had some good things to say but I guess I don't understand why we're so weird when whenever we quote from it and we're considered a cult and yet if you would strip a lot of men's other men's sayings out of the preachers uh sermons a lot of the modern day preachers you'd be surprised of how little that they actually come up on their own the difference between us and Them is we're just honest where we get it at so we want to point you back in that direction but for the sake of this question tonight um I I've chosen not to U bring you any quotes we want to be able to go directly to the scripture and we've said it before that what we believe is based from the Bible we do not believe that brother random come to replace our Bible but he come to make our Bible so real that when we read our Bible it just means so much more to us through the enlightenment of this day so first of all we'd like to read tonight in 1st Samuel 3:1 with a saying that is is very common to us but might be un ual to others and that is that the word came to the prophets now Prophet is totally different than somebody like me brother Joe any other evangelist Pastor teacher missionary whatever it is a prophet has several different things about him that is so unique this is during the time frame when Eli is the priest Eli has become old and he's compromised as far as with his sons his sons are they're living terrible lives lives and the people of Israel know that they're not living right they're they're swindling money they're just doing all kinds of things and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli What A peculiar statement and the word of the Lord was precious in those days the word of the Lord was precious in those days and this is the reason why there was was no open Vision now remember this is after of course Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses they have the Torah the first five books of Moses the pente they have uh some of the the other writings there so why would the writer here of Samuel say the word of the Lord was precious in those days well of course the Torah was precious Genesis Exodus Leviticus or numbers other Leviticus and Deuteronomy so it would have been precious but why does he use the words open Vision now the word open the Hebrew word simply means a clearer understanding so the word was precious but it had been quite a span of time since there had been a prophet on the earth look with me at the word vision and it's a caon which means vision and it can have several different meanings the first one is in an estatic state so for those of you that were here last night and I was going through that about the spoken words Original Seed and brother Brandon was preaching and while he's preaching the vision of what he was talking about actually happened right before his eyes and he got beside himself when you go back and listen to it he was just beside himself and he had to kind of come back and regroup a little bit because he was he was changing Dimensions while it was going on so this is one of the meanings of vision in a static state or it is an oracle or a prophecy or a Divine communication so now they had the the word on on the skins and they had no doubt people that was talking about it it wasn't that they didn't have the book and and that they never read it they did but the problem was there was no open Vision so there was no one there now there were teachers of the written word there were preachers probably that would go about talk about how great it was how wonderful it was but there was no one there that could be able to see an open Vision now if God had something new to say there was no one there to catch it without a prophet now God could have had the Old Testament and the New Testament all written by Moses if that's what he wanted to do but God chose to divide his Revelation and what he would give to to the people down Through the Ages and he would let it out in increments so God would let this be spoken and that spoken and another thing spoken but he chose his means of communication would not be priest it would not be pastors it would not be evangelists but it would be prophets that would have the ability to see an open Vision now does anybody here know how old Samuel was whenever they this happened to him 12 a 12year old boy but God had something he wanted to say now this is where we look at the need of a prophet and the majority of Christendom they look at oh we don't need no Prophet we've got the Bible well they had the first five books of Moses and part of the writings of the other brothers uh why in the world would they need a prophet because God had something else he wanted to say and that's where we look at it in this day that God had something that he wanted to say and so the message is not a com compendium it's not you know it's something that we type in like a Bible dictionary but it is a message that's why we call it the message God never intended for us to make a new denomination and call it the message so what is a message it was a message from the King and what was that message get back to the original word and expound more about mercy and blood I think when the Lord Jesus was here You' think if God had something that he wanted to say he would have said it all while the Incarnate Word was here but isn't it amazing that the Lord Jesus left many many things about the new test to a church to Paul to Peter to James to Luke well my goodness why did not the Lord God use his own human Temple and just say everything that he wanted to say that's not the way God does it God lets out his word in increments and he chooses the individual that he will use to do it through now watch in 2 Samuel 24: 11 for when David was up in the morning the word of the Lord came unto the prophet Gad David's sear so when David got up early in the morning the word of the Lord came the word of the Lord now what happened to Samuel you remember the story of course that whenever Samuel he heard the voice of God speaking to him he was not he was not aware of the voice of God so it goes to Eli and he wakes Eli up and he said you call for me he said no I didn't call for you go back to bed he goes back to bed and he hears the voice call his name so he goes back to Eli what do you want you call for me he said no I never call for you go back to bed but he said if you hear it speak the next time here am I my Lord speak respond so what did he do God came the third time and he called this young man's name and he said Lord here's your servant speak now the first words that he gets from God it's not a great word of salutation it's not a great word of comfort and God is going to bless Israel and God's going to do this anybody know what it was it was about the destruction of the House of Eli so the next morning Eli asked him he said did the Lord come to you he said yeah in other words as wiet I don't want to talk about it I I I don't want to say what the Lord said you imagine how hard that would be because his mother promised that she would give him to God so she brings him back to the house of God as a we a we child and he's been there for years of his life and Eli no doubt was a great mentor in his life and now he's got a message from God well why did God tell Moses that cuz Moses never wrote about Eli so God had a word a current current present tense word to say and there was no open Vision there was a gap now well couldn't God send an angel he could have if he wanted to but he chose men to be able to bring these sort of things you understand so you can see then the way that we look at the need of a prophet we follow this same Forum from the Old Testament right down to the new and to us it just makes perfect sense but for those outside of that because many of them are Tau well the law and the prophets are un to John they don't even know what that verse of scripture actually even means they're using that to try to prove that when the New Testament comes we don't even need no more prophets goes to show they haven't read their new testament very far now watch so when God had something to say the word of the Lord would come to these prophets now they were also called sear anybody know what that word means simply like what you would do you see so they were given this this synonym that would be in comparison comparable to a prophet which mean they saw so they were a Seer so they'd be standing right there just like I am here and all of a sudden they break into the fourth dimension and they're in another world and they're SA saying things they don't have a clue what they're even saying and they would come to them themselves and that's the part that was absolutely infallible because God had them so under his control it was impossible for them to say anything wrong and that's where again of course it this stumbles the people of this day now remember the prophet tells us in the church age book that there must be a need a return of the power of infallibility in the last day so if God was going to say something he would not use a man like Benny hen and Billy Grahams we looked at last night or Roberts God could not give if he had a word to say in this day he could not just use them what did they do they repeated the scriptures that was already there what do I preach I repeat the scriptures I repeat what the prophets preach why cuz I'm not a Seer I'm not a Seer and there's not another prophet major prophet after Malachi 4 you've heard me say it for years there ain't no Malachi 4 and 5 and a half it's 4 and five and that's it now watch in First Kings chapter 16:7 also by the hand of the Prophet jahu the son of hananiah came the word of the Lord against basa and against his house even for all the evil that he had done in the sight of the Lord in provoking anger so now God had a new word and a lot of these words that God had it wasn't pleasant it was not things that the people wanted to hear so God had a word to speak how's God going to speak it he's got to have a Seer and that sear will get in the presence of God and God will drop that word down some of them as Jeremiah had a scribe called baroo and Jeremiah would go into this trance and these visions and maybe did not even know what he was saying so while he was there and his eyes are looking straight ahead and he's in this translation it must have been in in some ways kind of a spooky type of thing because it's like they were there but they were not there and a scribe would sit there and write down it shall come to pass on such and such and so and so and maybe the vision last 10 15 20 minutes and then Jeremiah come out of the vision and it would leave him weak and he was just saying what what what happened what what what did I say Brook don't worry Prophet I wrote it down I wrote it down why God had something to say oh I'll tell you me going back and studying all this for this question it made me so appreciate a prophet of God in our day notice in Jeremiah chap 28:12 then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet after that hananiah the prophet had broke the Yoke from off the neck of the Prophet Jeremiah oh wow so now we got two prophets and they're saying the exact opposite so if you and I were living in that day how are we going to know which one's right so Hannah jumps up thus sayith the Lord boy this will happen and that'll happen Jeremiah comes into the court of the king he's made a Yol of wood he comes in Prophet you symbol so he comes in with his hands they'd cut it in half and they'd have a hole here and two holes over here and they put their hands and end around their neet and here he comes in and hanani runs over to him and say you're a liar you're a false prophet God that call these people boy you imagine him getting so excited and all riled up he jerked and grabbed a hold of that Yol and busted it all to pieces Jeremiah goes out and comes back in a little while later with an iron Yol on and he tells hananiah thus sayith the Lord because you have done what you have done you will die this year guess what he didn't live a year and six months he died that year now what hananiah said did not happen and it did not come to pass but Jeremiah Was A Vindicated Prophet Vindication what do we mean by that now remember Jeremiah most of the Old Testament prophets were not like Moses in the sense that they called for the Red Sea to open up and God created bread and and quail and all that no you wouldn't know those guys by those signs a few of them did signs but that was not the way you recognize it John the Baptist we have no record in the New Testament that John ever had one miracle in his ministry so how would we know them by the word that came out of their mouths so their identification and their Vindication see how blessed we are so can you imagine if we were living in the Old Testament and God would have sent us Jeremiah and Ezekiel and all those prophets we never saw no signs no wonders they never called nobody El and said your name is so and so you went to a doctor today and you saw this and all that you imagine how blessed we are that we not only have the Vindication of the word but we have these signs to be able to convince us hey children this is me so here two men rise up and what do they have both of them have words both of them have words so one saying one thing and the other one is saying exact opposite one says you'll go down into Babylon and you'll be there two years thus sayeth the Lord the other one says you won't be down there two years you'll be down there 70 years for it's thus sayith the Lord and here you and I are sitting there and we're thinking how am I supposed to know which one's right what if Jeremiah had signs and wonders and he'd turn his back to the audience and say there's a young girl sitting right back there she has on a blue shirt she went to work today her boss told her so and so would say oh my goodness oh my goodness and then that false prophet would stand up there well I can't do that I I don't know how to do that he ain't nothing but a witch he he's just a warlock and a wizard neither one of them had that so you're the congregation how you going to judge these guys God give us the pattern in Deuteronomy we'll get to it in a bit now watch Jeremiah 46:1 the word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles now if you remembered or not but last time we spoke about this I told you that God whenever Israel became divided to Israel and Judah that it was even so that some of the prophets were sent to Israel only and some to Judah only but there were some of the Old Testament prophets which were sent to All Nations Jeremiah was one of them but now every Prophet was not sent to All Nations Elijah was one of them Jeremiah was one of them habac Obadiah Jonah many of those you know they had a dead designated area that they stayed in so you can see then why the spirit of Elijah must come in the last day why we needed a prophet that would not just be a prophet to the Jews only like Hosea was or Amos was or a prophet to just the Gentiles only but we needed the anointing of a prophet which would go across Multicultural multinationals that would be able to be a prophet to the entire world thank God for that notice again Jeremiah 471 the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines before that Pharaoh smoked Gaza now you realize this is the same Gaza that they're fighting over today so Jeremiah Was Not only a prophet to the Jews he had the word of God to the Jews but also to the Gentiles also to the Philistines Daniel chapter 9:2 in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet So Daniel is amongst those that are brought into captivity and whenever he goes down there him and his brothers they take the books of Jeremiah now those books were two one of them is called The Book of Jeremiah and the other one is called Lamentations that one was written outside the city in a cave on the outside of Jerusalem when the children of Israel carried captivity as Jeremiah sets there they called him the weeping prophet so he's weeping as he watched his prophecy come to pass then that book is later carried down into the Captivity so decades go by and something begins to move on Daniel's heart and he begins to think now wait a minute did not Jeremiah prophesy that there would be a span of time so how was it that they knew the time was near by the books of a Vindicated Prophet you think you think it mattered to Daniel that people laughed at him because he was reading from the books of a prophet that other people said well that Man's dead well why in the world would you read the books from a dead man why in the world would you want to stand up there and address the congregation and read to them quotes and no doubt Daniel would when they would stand up and they would have prayer meetings and whatever that they would do and Daniel would stand up and say now look Saints I want to read to you today from the Prophet Jeremiah because the Prophet Jeremiah said this 65 years ago look we're close we're close how did he know they were close because he was reading from the books of the Prophet Jeremiah he understood by the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet so you see they could have searched and they could have looked diligently in Genesis Exodus numbers Leviticus Deuteronomy Joshua Judges and they would have not found out how long they were supposed to be there because God never told Moses he told Jeremiah so if you're going to be in tune with the hour you live you've got to find the right word for the age you live in now they could have said God told Moses this and God told Abraham that and God told Jo Jacob this and Joseph that and we could say Amen but we're down here in captivity what did God say about us well we've got to find a prophet who had the ability to have open vision and God would be able to give him a word for the day and hour We're living so you imagine how they felt when they would pick up this book of Jeremiah and they would say this is modern events made clear by prophecy and they say think of it Saints we're living in this day Jeremiah was done Dead and Gone we're living in this day of Prophecy oh praise the Lord ha guy chapter 1 verse one in the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month name the word of the Lord B hagga the prophet un zerubabel the son of shatil governor of Judah unto Joshua the son of josc the high priest saying okay now let's go back let's go back to Jeremiah so God now had a word for who for zerubabel zerubba is going to be the governor where they're going back to rebuild the Temple so it's under the administration of zerubabel and Nehemiah so if they would search through all the books of Jeremiah and say God we need a word we need a word what do we do Lord what do we do they would not have found it cuz Jeremiah said you're going to go back you're going to go back you're going to go back so what do we do when we get back Jeremiah you're going to go back you're going to go back but God didn't tell them what to do once they got back why God had another increment of his word that he was going to give to a man who had the ability to have an open Vision to me this is so simple oh my Hagi chapter 2:10 in the four and 20th day of the ninth month in the second year of Darius came the word of the Lord by hagga the prophet saying now notice he has the word of the Lord in chapter one but now we're in chapter two some time has passed they've went through a lot of Trials went through a lot of difficulties now what do they need another word from God to tell them what to do with where they currently are I hope you understand what I'm fixing to say we God has so blessed us with a message in this hour brother Rob and I were telling about actually before we come over why was running a little bit late we was just talking about the word and how good it is and I I told him that I just got a a quote from a brother from India last week and this brother not a Ministry thing but he shares things with me and other brothers and he just loves to study the word and he he sent me this quote and whenever I opened it up in the email and there was there was three words in there in this quote I had just listened to this tape not long ago I have listened to it you know how many ever years that I've been in the message over and over again and whenever I saw those words in that quote it looked like they were that big I mean they just jumped right out at me and I said down and I started studying and the Lord give me the inspiration it was just like an explosion that was going on and I thought how could I have missed that that is so awesome that is so wonderful well now you see there is not another promise for another Prophet but God still releases what's been said in increments to us in the day we're living sometimes I hear preachers preach and I'm thinking why in the world where did they get that at how did I miss that I just listened to that tape last week you see what God does god holds back the full inspiration from this prophetic message and he gives it to us when we need it and then your needs and your needs and your needs and Men of God will be inspired and they'll catch the mind of the Lord and they'll be listening to a tape reading their Bible and all of a sudden oh my goodness oh praise the Lord Praise the Lord what is it the same spirit of God giving us the increment of the word of what we need for where we are how mindful he is of us now watch Zechariah 1 verse one in the eighth month in the second year of Darius now catch this so here we have hagga which spoke in the 4 and 20th day in the ninth month in the second year of Darius and yet we have Zach arah in the eighth month in the second year of Darius came the word of the Lord unto Zachariah so here we've got two prophets now and the word coming to them about different things the son of beiia the son of IDU the prophet so watch how the word comes so it wasn't like a group of people got together and they said what do y'all saying don't you think we need to make a move of God what do you say what should we call ourselves and how should we dress and how should we do this and what will be our agenda no no that that's never the way that God did it through a group of people but God used one man and that one man would bring the word of God and that time frame that he was in now there was a time when there was some Minor Prophets and they would overlap each other though one might be in Judah and the other might be in Israel and God had something to say so he would use what prophets to be able to do it now let's look in the in the New Testament Matthew chapter 2 verse 23 for the Jews whenever they come to the time the of the Messianic dispensation in the New Testament they had to have it proved to them by the Old Testament prophets that Jesus was the Messiah and watch he came and dwelt in a city called nazarus that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the priest by the elders by the organizational fathers by who the prophets he shall be called a Nazarene now watch Matthew writes his gospel after the Lord Jesus has come and lived on the earth and done gone so now they're going backwards and they're riding in retrospect and they're writing after they got the Holy Ghost so remember all these events and the four gospels is not being written while it's happening I'm glad too cuz the Lord knew how to do that it would have sounded totally different had the gospels been written pre Holy Ghost that's why the gospels are preached different when men don't have the Holy Ghost a man with the Holy Ghost that preaches Matthew is totally different from a man who don't have the Holy Ghost that preaches Matthew so if Matthew was written before Matthew got the Holy Ghost Matthew would sound different after Matthew got the Holy Ghost so it's the same with us in the way that we read it notice again in Matthew 5:17 think not this is Jesus now think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets now this is the way dispensation that the Old Testament was divided so it was not divided in the way you never find Jesus you never find Paul any of the New Testament preachers ever going down through and say the book of Zechariah the book of this the book of that the book of but they would group it into two categories the law and the prophets the law and the prophets you look study your own Bible you'll find this used over and over again so the law which came by Moses and then the prophets but remember the Sadducees the Sadducees only took the first five books of Moses so they never took Joshua Judges they never took Jeremiah Hosea Ezekiel can you imagine how much they missed they missed all of Isaiah so they only took the first five books of Moses so to them all that they felt like was Vindicated was the first five books of Moses no wonder they were so ignorant when John the Baptist came and when Jesus came now just relate that now to people in the day that we are living in that will not take another god-sent prophet in this age so how much they miss so you imagine living in that day you were a sadducee and somebody quoted from the book of Jeremiah and you say h i don't I don't read that Jeremiah stuff Hosea Hosea Moses never wrote Hosea you're adding to the word the original word was the first five books of Moses we don't need nothing else it's no wonder then the Pharisees did not believe in angels demons Resurrection Life After Death why Moses never wrote about it so you can see why modern Christianity misunderstands and misses so much and we don't say this with our chest stuck out B we know more than everybody but also more is required of us because of what we know to me it's worth the requirement ain't it you now watch think not that I'm come to destroy the law the Pent the Torah or the prophets Jeremiah Ezekiel naam Hosea Amos on and on I am not come to destroy but to fulfill but now remember there's still many Prophecies of of Jeremiah of Ezekiel of Zachariah of hag even of those Old Testament prophets that have not yet been fulfilled so people who think the Old Testament is totally done and finished no D to even read as a matter of fact there was some visitors that had come here not long ago and they made comment to somebody from our church and said your pastor read from the Old Testament today does he preach often from the Old Testament well that's the way they look at it well the old testament's fulfilled we don't need it no more so what about in Zachariah where the mountain is going to be cut in half and part of it toward the former sea and part of it toward the hinder sea that's at the coming of the Lord Jesus when he's going to fight the battle of Armageddon what about all them prophecies it makes you feel so sorry for them notice again Matthew 7:12 therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you even even so do to them so to them for this is the law and the prophets Matthew 11:13 for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John now remember this is a common saying among them Matthew 22:40 on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets so they quoted it over and over and over again so the Torah and the prophets the Torah and the prophets Matthew 23:29 woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepers of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore you be Witnesses unto yourselves ye are the children of them that killed the prophets and you what's amazing is this age has done exactly the same thing boy if I'd have lived it back y in the days of Jeremiah I can't believe them people would have throwed him down in that mud pit and left him down there for days can you imagine that Prophet Jeremiah being thrown down in an abandoned well in mud up on his body can you imagine Isaiah been put in a hollow l and they take a Crosscut saw and cut that man in two and yet the people come back and said oh what a great man Jeremiah Was what a great man Ezekiel was and Jesus said it was your fathers that killed him and you said boy if I lived in that day you said what Jesus is trying to get him to see but this is your day and may I say to us tonight this is our day so we you don't want to look back and say oh man I'll tell you one thing if I'd have been in the days of brother Bram I would have stood for him but this is the continuation of those same days so we be identified with what we do with it right now notice again in Luke chap 13:34 oh Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often I would have gathered thy children together as a hand do gather her brood under her wings and you would not chapter 18:31 then he took unto him the 12 and said unto them behold we go to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets Jesus ministry constantly was quoting the prophets I just find it so hard to understand why that modern day Christians think it's so weird and strange that Christianity would want to be based upon prophets what I think is weird and strange is Christians don't think it all to be this is the beginning of Christianity this is the beginning of the apostolic church and what was they constantly referring back to look at Paul look at Peter look at James and they constantly and the prophet said and the prophet said and the prophets said that's how they were proving that Jesus was the Christ notice in verse 25 then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken verse 27 and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself so what's he doing he preaches a 6-hour sermon on Prophecy so maybe started with able started back in the Garden of Eden maybe Deuteronomy 18:15 behold the Lord shall God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me from among your brethren and whosoever shall not hear this Prophet will be cut off maybe Deuteronomy 23 maybe Zachariah 12 maybe Isaiah 35 the lame man shall leap as an heart the tongue of the dumb shall sing maybe Hagi 27 the the desire of all the nations shall come on and on and on and all them scriptures is pointing to him except he wasn't saying and that's me and that's me and that's me but he wanted to quote the scriptures and see if they would be able to by their own understanding say that's him oh my goodness I've read that since a boy I've read that since a child since Torah school that scripture is made flesh praise the Lord notice in John chapter 1 verse 45 Phillip findeth Nathaniel and saith unto to him we have found him who Moses in the law and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph again John 645 it is written in the prophets they shall all be taught of God every man therefore that has heard and that have learned of the father cometh unto me acts 3:24 yay and and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days so what are they doing they're taking these new Believers and they're pointing them right back to the prophets not starting Christianity and saying we don't even need that Old Testament no more you see how ignorant a lot of modernday Christians even a lot of modern day preachers are spent many years in seminary and don't even see these things from the Bible when modernday Christianity is supposed to be a reflection of apostolic Christianity but surely you can see tonight it's not because the very thing the way that God established is we don't believe in no Prophet why they got away with them in the Old Testament that's strange I'm reading to you tonight one old test New Testament scripture after another and it's evident it was based upon Old Testament prophecy amen acts 10:43 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sin acts 13:27 for they that dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not uhoh nor yet the voices of the prophet prophets which are read every Sabbath day are you talking about making these people mad so here whenever he preaches this he says they did not recognize him nor do they recognize the voices of their prophets because their prophets was talking about the Lord Jesus are you talking about making them fighting mad they studied these prophets they say that those priests and men who never knew those Scrolls could take those Scrolls up and they could roll them up just like this and if possible they could have took a pen and stuck a pen through that scroll and tell you every word that it would have passed through they knew it that well that's somebody that knows what they're talking about somebody told me today of the man who owns the Evergreen Nursery over in Kingsport they are first generation immigrants their parents were immigrants that moved here to to America and their father started the business that the sons now run Johnson City and in Kingsport and the some people told him and said why don't you get a bobcat and you know and attractor with a bucket he said why get all that I've got four boys with shovels and they say the owner of the one in Kingsport to this day can load a ton of Rock with a fade or a shovel and get within 20 lbs of a ton now you don't do that by reading a book you don't do that by sitting in air conditioning with your feet all kick back drinking a glass of ice cold Southern sweet tea but you do it by shoveling and feeling the pressure and feeling the weight so here this is the way that we as Christians we don't want to just come to the house of God and let the preacher do all the study oh brother Donnie you study so good and brother Daryl my we thank you thank you thank you well that's all well and good for me to do that but you want to be able to do in Your Capacity to where do I expect you or brother Rob or any the rest of the brother CH expect you to be able to explain all this the way maybe a preacher would no but from your capability you want to be able to stand and if your questionings that well I may not be able to explain the way our pastor can but I'll tell you what I sat in a young service I used service not long ago he went from the Old Testament right down to the new proven why we still believe in prophets because it's all through the Bible we don't have to be ashamed of what we believe because in reality we believe more Bible than all these denominations put together out here I know I know I know they say we're not a Bible believing church I wish there here tonight I wish they'd come and hear how much Bible we do believe can you all say Amen to that now what what's Paul in Romans 3:21 said but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets now notice again they bring this same connotation over from the early days of the of the gospels to hear Paul is saying the same thing Romans 16:26 the law and the prophets but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets you mean to tell me they looked at these men with their open vision and believed that what they said was scriptures wow now remember they were men they had their ups and their downs was everything that went out of the mouth of Jeremiah the word of the Lord of course not Jeremiah got into great strain and a great trial and he was hated man I'll tell you he's always been one of my heroes I can't wait to meet Jeremiah I've always had such an admiration for him he was so hated and so despised and Jeremiah got so down one day he said I'll tell you what I made up my mind I ain't speaking no more in the name of the Lord I can't take it I ain't speaking no more in the name of the Lord but then he said I found out I couldn't restrain myself cuz it was like fire shut up in my bones so Jeremiah was a man Moses was a man Ezekiel was a man but they were still God's mouthpieces praise the Lord notice in 1 Corinthians 14:29 now for those who don't believe that the New Testament spoke about prophets now remember this is not the same caliber a prophet is the Old Testament there were prophets in the New Testament agabus was a new testament prophet he prophesied of a dur which was a famine that was going to come he also prophesied to Paul and he took one of Paul's garments and he never had met Paul and he took Paul's garment and went over to Paul and and kind of tied around him and he said whoever garment this is this man he's going to Jerusalem he's going to be bound now remember he didn't know him so it was exactly the word of the Lord but here Paul is identifying people in the church that are prophesying under the inspiration of tongues or interpretation now watch he said let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge now there are some of the message of course that feel like that gifts should not be judged and they feel like that brother brandham kind of brought that from the Baptist idea ah you see you need to read First Corinthians a little bit closer because Paul was actually the one who said gifts needs to be judged it did not start with brother brandham it started with Paul and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets so here in the New Testament Church they believed in them type of prophets as well now let's go back to Malachi 4 Malachi 4 4 verse 5 the coming of Elias which is the Greek rendition of Elijah of the Old Testament but notice what Malachi says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and conjunction joins two thoughts together the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now let's look in Luke chapter 1 verse 15 this is speaking of John the Baptist for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and He Shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God now notice the office of a prophet in the New Testament he's going to turn the hearts of these children to the Lord God but also verse 17 he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias so it was not The Reincarnation of Elijah but it was the anointing of Elijah on a man born between another man and woman to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and now wait a minute Malachi quoted two parts of this Malachi said he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers but when this Angel is coming bringing the message about John the Baptist he only quotes half of Malachi 4 and it is the half that pertains to that day so he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children what fathers are we talking about those old Jewish fathers which was totally contrary to understand their Customs the elders I you know it's hard to imagine imagine but Abraham even though he would have been up in his years 50 60 70 years old but yet his father still being alive he was still been considered under the headship of his father whenever God made known to Abraham the revelation of I am and who he was it was against all oral tradition for him to Buck against his father and say father I'm leaving you it it would have T that family to shreds because the patriarchal headship of the way they looked at it oh my it would have just broke everything they had believed for hundreds and hundreds of years and yet God made Abraham do it so for Malachi to prophesy this that there will come a day that the father's Hearts will be turned to the children are you kidding me there's no way that's not the way the patriarchal ancestry of the genealogy and the way the structure of the home was set up you imagine Abraham a man 70 75 years old and he goes to his father and said that this this God has has appeared to me and I I I I need your permission to leave well some of y'all don't do that at 15 Amen brother Donnie Amen brother Donnie but look at the structure of how they believed it and yet a prophecy was that one day there come a man on the earth under such an anointing that that anointing he's operating on will actually CA some of the fathers and they will actually turn to the message that the children are are carrying I see for us it don't make any sense because we're reading the Bible from our Western understanding from if you would have been an easterner and you would have heard this prophecy You' said what no way no way God will ever make us fathers bow down to the children and what did God do God took a 33 year old man called John the Baptist and took another 33y old man which would have been an upstart and green and whatever words they would have used in that day to look down on a young guy and they said are you kidding me me and Jesus rebuked the elders you got to be kidding Jesus would rebuke the elders these are the men that everybody reveres you just didn't do that you get your head cut off for doing it wow so watch what John the Baptist now is going to do so he will be great and the side of the Lord he'll drink NE the wine going to be a Nazarite of course and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of theas to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just now wait a minute where's that other part that Malachi said the hearts of the children back to the fathers John the Baptist was not called for that is't it amazing how God can divide the scripture right in the middle of a line and fulfill one part of it and wait for 2,000 years to fulfill the other part praise God thank you Lord Jesus can I have a few more minutes before we close and we'll pick it up again so the disciples asked the Lord Jesus about the coming of Elijah and as they come down from the mountain now Jesus is this is Mount Transfiguration Jesus has been transformed transfigured so as they come down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come now listen very carefully Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall future tense right shall first come and this is what he'll do and restore all things so Elias truly shall future tense come and restore all things look at me at the meaning of the word restore restore again to restore to its former state to be in its former state so if John the Baptist fulfilled that part why did Jesus said shall and if John the Baptist was supposed to restore what did he restore to Moses never baptized right that was not John the Baptist calling that was your prophet's calling then watch Jesus he goes from the future prophecy Elias coming but I say unto you that Elias has come already you imagine them as they ask him why do you speaking riddles why do you speaking Parables I mean you say one thing and then you say something else so Jesus says look Elias is going to come one day but he's already come and you're thinking yeah right right I mean what am I doing here wh wh why am I following this man what in the world he's coming but he's come you see even it it even does the same thing today when people look at us and we say glory to God the Lord Jesus has come but he's coming and people say they're nuts they're absolutely out of their mind no we believe he has come in a spiritual coming he is here but we're waiting for the Corporal body to come back so here Jesus is speaking in a dual language well Elijah's coming he could have called his name he could have told us what day he's going to be born amen April 6 1909 burville Kentucky a lot will come in he could have told all that but he didn't want to he wanted to leave that so the elect will'll be able to find out who it was now watch so Jesus doesn't even say hey boys let me just give you an inside tip it's John the Baptist so Jesus didn't say that he says Elias has come already and they know him not but they've done whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist oh so maybe that was the reason Jesus didn't say said hey boys it's John he wanted to paint the scripture image and hope they would wake up you know Ding and they finally hit him ding you understand some of these men were formerly John's disciples imagine brother way whenever they finally recognized it and they didn't even know who he was till after John's them been killed and Jesus said it was it was Elijah and they're thinking oh my Lord I walked with him I was with the man I sat under his ministry you mean that was the anointing of Elijah may God help us that it don't pass before us and we wake up and realize my John 1: 19 this is then the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christos the Christ and they asked him what then art thou Elias and he sayth I am not well now wait a minute Jesus said he was but they ask John direct re and John says no I am not Elijah what you say brother Donnie which one of them told the truth both of them you see if you catch the phraseology of the way they asked him they were ask him about the Elijah of the last day and John said uh oh boys you got it at the wrong dispensation I'm not that Elijah John did not lie he told them truth but John understood the gospel in a dispensational way does that make sense to you tonight and he says I am not art thou that prophet and he answered nope and they said unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself oh their feathers are getting rougher by now ain't they and he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet as sayas Isaiah 40:3 the voice of him that crying on the the Wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God and I found this bit of history and I want to share it with you the idea is taken from the practice of Eastern monarchs who whenever they entered upon an expedition or took a journey especially through the desert and unpracticed countries sent harbingers before them to prepare all things for their passage and Pion iers now listen to this word Pioneers to open the passes so they were harbingers so they're going to open up now remember they didn't have Interstate 26 they didn't even have a Milligan Highway or Governor alph Taylor wrote so they had rocks they had all kinds of things in the way so they would send away and John identifies himself by Revelation and say this is who I am I'm here to pick up the rocks out of the way I'm here to get the sticks out of the way he's right behind me he's right behind me oh my to open up the passes to level the ways to remove all impediments so John the Baptist calls himself the pioneer of the Messiah whose business it was as a loud voice to call upon the people dwelling in the deserts to level and prepare the roads by which the King was about to March Isaiah 40 and4 every Valley shall be exalted Every Mountain and Hill shall be made low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouths of the Lord Lord has spoken it now back to John 1:24 and they which were sin of the Pharisees they asked him and said unto him why baptizes thou then if thou be not that Christ nor Elias neither that Prophet John answered them saying I baptize thee with water but there standest one among you whom you know not he it is whom coming after me is preer heard before me whose shoes latchet I'm not worthy to unloose verse 28 we'll close you bear witness you yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but that I am sent before him he that hath the bride I don't know if you know this or not but the first man in the New Testament to refer to the church as a bride was a man under the spirit of Elijah John the Baptist he that hath the bride is the bridegroom Now watch how John identifies himself but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and hearth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfill now John is identifying himself with a common practice of that day and that was that if a man was interested in a girl a woman he would go to his father or he would go to a lawyer sometimes or a friend his uncle and he would tell his uncle his father whoever it was I'm interested in that sister and it he would not go and do it but the friend of the bridegroom would go and talk to the bride's father and the bride mother and they would start working on a compact to be able to make it together not the bride and groom they didn't have none of this stuff of the bride and groom thing well they're going to go out and they're going to you know in that rebellious age of the RO I don't need to talk to the daddy I don't need to talk to this that's the way they did it that's the exact way that Mary and Joseph was joined together under that exact pattern so John identifies himself as the friend of the bridegroom now John went and saw the bride John took the garments to the bride John actually would be the one the messenger the friend that would drop the message to them and let them know cuz the bride didn't know exactly when the day was so the groom would just decide today's the day today's the day and of course the bride didn't have text WhatsApp Zoom you know now that stuff so you know who the groom depended on to let the bride know now you doesn't get her wedding gwn and all that the friend of the bridegroom so the friend of the bridegroom I mean he goone that day it was the day that she washed her hair it was a day that she didn't normally put it in curlers it was the day that everything was all been out of shape oh no no no not today I've got to go to the market I've got to go but he told me to tell you today is the day glory to God so well how how how the world she going to be ready she is not going to be unless she hears the voice of that messenger you see only those who hear the voice of the message and the Messenger will be ready who was it that received the Lord Jesus those that John had prepared this one thing the angel of the Lord told him he shall turn many of the hearts to the Lord and He fulfilled that thank God thank God verse 30 let's Stand Together John speaking about Jesus he must increase but I must decrease that Simon of course Andrew his brother had already been following John Jesus was there whenever he baptized him and a few days later he comes up and pass by and John turns and says behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world and you can see that John is a true Messenger because you know what he done he pointed his disciples to the Lord Jesus so John did not have a problem with them looking away from John's flesh and following the Lord Jesus he was the Lamb of God oh my I think every real true preacher feels that way they want the people that they're preaching to let me decrease Let Jesus increase in our church this is what the prophet God you know what breaks your heart is that for many they want the prophet to increase and they want all they just you know as the Bible said in the book of Acts that they have them every Sabbath that preach Moses they preach Moses so some all they get out of this message is just exalt in brother brandom and it's brother brandham this and brother brandom that one of the things I've never really told that much about it a phase when I first started coming to the ministry into the message one of the things that kept me back was an individual that I had met some years before I accepted the message and it was all the time telling me this that and that and that and he was constantly pointing to the Flesh of brother Brandon and whenever I begin to see the message those things it it actually it hindered me brother Rob I had to fight over the top of it because I thought there's no way that man would want us to to worship Him want us to lift him up cons we're talking about him and preaching about him no what did the prophet want us to do let him decrease Let Jesus increase in our midst is that what we want may we decrease that the Lord Jesus can increase you love him tonight with all your hearts let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you for your word thank you Lord Jesus for the scriptures I pray dear God that it will open their understanding they may not be able to take these same scriptures many of them have wrote them down tonight and it does my heart good to see that father they may not have the ability to be able to sit down and put it together to share with somebody they're going to school with or something like that that but father may it be more settled in their hearts after these studies than it's ever been before we love you Lord we don't desire to see some man lifted up before us it's you Lord Jesus we want to worship you and praise you and adore you we thank you for letting us see this word may these young people not only them but everyone else streaming this service and those that archive it I know there's people in Africa in Europe in Alaska Lord all over the world going back and and hearing these services and being such a blessing to them may each of us realize we must hear the voice that you have sent in this last day or we will not be prepared for the coming of the Lord only those that heard that voice of John and prep preparing their hearts were opened up to be able to receive you all they might have said oh I don't need John I don't get out of my way John you're a man I'm after Jesus they couldn't have understood you had they not come to him and you said it well there was a man sent from God whose name was John he was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of that light that all men through him might be believe and be saved that's how important a prophet messenger is how we thank you for ours Lord we're so grateful for sending us a prophet to fulfill the latter half of Malachi 4 that it would do what turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers Lord Jesus I believe I'm looking at some young people tonight whose faith is turned back to that original word it is my honor to be called their Pastor it is my honor to preach to them praise be to God young people who are baptized the same way as some of the young people in the book of Acts they believe election the same way they believe the gospel the teachings of the church in the same way that our predecessors did over 2,000 years ago oh Want to Thank You Lord Jesus I'm so glad my heart has been turned I give you thanks for it tonight thank you father in Jesus name brother Rob [Applause] we're going to sing a few songs but first I want to tell you what that did for me tonight brother Donnie I I've had lots of friends but brother Donnie being my pastor has been special to me in my life because it's something to hear of his Revelation I I recognize I have to have my own and it's something that he paints what does he do what has he done for me is paint the picture he's an artist right he Paints the picture so that you can see it okay and then it's easier to see it and you can you can he Paints the picture so clear that how I it's like how can you not see it okay but that has to drive you and I'm going to say it drives me to look deeper into the word so what it is that he shared for me tonight is the pattern of the scripture so lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of Me Jesus said right to see the pattern of the scripture from Genesis to Revelations to the Old Testament throughout the New Testament and painting that picture to see it so that I can go deeper I cannot rest on his Revelation I have to have my own I do not deserve a secondhand Revelation you must dig into yourself and anchor yourself so when someone asks you what you believe you have your own Revelation to speak from as he mentioned tonight in Your Capacity right so it's something that's what's dear to me so I wanted to share with you what I got out of tonight and that's where I want to go deeper into the scripture I was wondering where he was going and sometimes it takes me a while to figure out and sometimes it's over my head and I love that because it makes me want to dive in deeper and know okay what is he seeing and God is patient God is patient to let you go down that road and develop that picture for yourself and sometimes it's like okay we're going through and through and he paints a big broad picture but it's helped me and it's made me it's giving me a foundation that I know and so I thank God for it and I have to hold this all night so brother Jesse you want to hold this sing God bless y'all love you it wasn't that wonderful give brother Donnie [Applause] hand she was a virgin bride to be and one night as she lay quietly the spirit of the Lord Lord overshadowed her and said that he you conceive a child that sin cannot defile
