[0:00] you can be seated for a couple minutes
[0:02] before we read the scripture sometimes
[0:10] laughing listen to for just just a few
[0:12] minutes before we fully read the
[0:15] scripture a few weeks ago I was in a
[0:25] vision
[0:26] and I was standing up on a high place
[0:29] and I was to see the preview of the
[0:32] church and I notice coming from a
[0:36] standing more like this way facing the
[0:38] West and coming this way was the lovely
[0:42] bunch of women real nice risk long hair
[0:46] six nights in the back please Birchtown
[0:50] neatly and they were all in a marching
[0:53] tune like onward Christian soldiers
[0:57] marching as to war with the cross of
[1:01] Jesus going on before and as they passed
[1:04] by a student there was something there
[1:07] huh some spirit with God
[1:10] it said there is the bride and I look
[1:14] like my heart was happy and she went
[1:16] around this way and passed around behind
[1:19] me after a while when she come back this
[1:22] way and said now the modern church will
[1:25] come into preview and here come the
[1:28] Asian church up honors thesis a filthy
[1:31] Bunch
[1:31] here come the other churches up all the
[1:34] different they look horrible and I'll
[1:37] say this because I'm duty bound to tell
[1:40] the truth before God and when he said
[1:43] here comes the Church of America now to
[1:46] be previews if I ever seen a bunch of
[1:50] Devils it was that then women were
[1:53] stripped naked with an old great-looking
[1:57] thing like a color of an elephant time
[1:59] and there's whole in front of us with
[2:02] the whole upper part on it
[2:03] and they were doing this kind of stuff
[2:06] that these these dances these kids do
[2:09] out here that the twist and stuff and
[2:11] that kind of music going on
[2:13] I want our scene miss us a thumb up I
[2:18] almost fainted now this is Duff saith
[2:24] the Lord
[2:25] you believe me to be his servant you
[2:27] believe me now
[2:28] I would say that for nothing in the
[2:30] world there's not enough money in all
[2:33] the world to get me to say that if it
[2:34] wasn't true and when she come by that
[2:38] was a filthy looking thing I ever seen I
[2:40] thought God is artists preachers and
[2:43] we've brother have labor to get you a
[2:45] bride and that's the best we could do
[2:47] she was twisting holding this in front
[2:50] of her like only truelist skirts on the
[2:52] thing holding it in front of her parts
[2:55] or part like this facing and twisting
[2:57] like these kids do out here on the on
[3:00] these vulgar shows that they have
[3:03] twisting that was miss Christianity I
[3:09] love America so help me by the help of
[3:13] God that's what it looks like in his
[3:15] face I just I saw I could've faded I go
[3:20] to all the trying and the preaching
[3:22] ended for sweet and firm one of us
[3:24] bought there and they were twisting and
[3:29] carrying on holding this in front they
[3:31] come around work I was standing there
[3:33] with this supernatural being I couldn't
[3:34] see my hearing talking to these right
[3:36] around me but when they threw this we
[3:38] did a whole dismiss twisting and
[3:39] laughing and going on hearing all I got
[3:42] holding this in front of them not me
[3:44] standing in his presence there and it is
[3:46] Sherman sort of all on Charlie that's
[3:49] the best I could do I love God
[3:54] what good did it do me I'm gonna to do
[3:59] all the crying and begging and
[4:00] persuading it the great signs and
[4:02] wonders and miracles that she showed I
[4:04] stood there go home and cry after
[4:07] preaching to him and thanks and what
[4:08] good did it do me and then I have to
[4:11] present something like that for you for
[4:13] a bride and I was just stood there
[4:16] looking she passed on by and you can
[4:18] imagine the back part of her was nothing
[4:21] on holiness in front of her as she went
[4:24] shimming by like that for this twist
[4:27] throwing her leaves not like that in her
[4:28] or it was bunker how she was hanging on
[4:31] her body shaking around like that I you
[4:35] say what does it mean brethren I don't
[4:37] know I'm just telling you what I see and
[4:41] when she passed by like that I looked at
[4:43] her oh I just got real clean I just
[4:45] turned around I thought God I'm
[4:47] condemned there's there's no need to be
[4:49] trying anything I just might as well
[4:50] quit miss Cara Williams if you're
[4:53] sitting on that dream that she told me
[4:55] about a while ago that you had the other
[4:57] night that's been bothering you there it
[4:58] is
[5:00] the starting when he was taken from the
[5:02] hand then I just thought I just might as
[5:09] well forget it I was gone and all of
[5:12] them one I heard it coming again and
[5:15] coming up on this side come the same
[5:18] bride they went around this way here
[5:21] come them little ladies again and each
[5:24] one of us best in their National Guard
[5:26] from where they come from like
[5:27] Switzerland Germany and so forth each
[5:29] one wearing that kind of guard all along
[5:31] hair just exactly like the one of the
[5:33] first in Germany was coming walking you
[5:36] home marching as to war and when they
[5:40] found the previous that where we were
[5:42] standing just all at once ever I went
[5:45] that way and then they turn back home
[5:48] they went marching and just as they
[5:50] started to going right up into the sky
[5:52] this other one went up to a brief of a
[5:54] hill and went
[5:55] like that Lee started marching right up
[5:58] into the sky and when they went to
[6:00] marching I noticed a couple of little
[6:02] girls in the back look like they might
[6:04] be of some farm girl like sweeping their
[6:07] switch leather somewhere they started to
[6:09] look around I got I said don't don't get
[6:13] out of step
[6:14] it is a scream I guess I come to in the
[6:16] vision center of my hand out like that I
[6:20] thought well that's the reason I said
[6:25] what I have I'm not sure what that means
[6:33] to you I'm not sure what that'll mean to
[6:37] the people who strain the service I hear
[6:39] it but to me it means so much the title
[6:48] of that sermon is choosing of a bride
[6:52] preachers April the 29th 1965 if you
[6:58] listen just a few more minutes from 7:00
[7:01] to 9:00 then it's on over to about 89 or
[7:03] 90 then you'll feel it move into another
[7:06] channel if your church is not lined up
[7:09] with the word and you said you'd better
[7:11] get out of that church and get into
[7:12] Christ before you don't know at what
[7:16] hour this city will be laid in the
[7:19] bottom of that ocean out there
[7:21] she's honeycombed under right now how
[7:24] long it'll hold the wrath of God over
[7:26] that sandbar only God knows although
[7:31] Capernaum our city called by the Angels
[7:35] and this is word that the judgment of
[7:37] God pronounces on Los Angeles how
[7:41] fitting
[7:44] let's read together first Timothy
[7:46] chapter 2 verse 9 and like manner also
[7:50] that women adorn themselves in modest
[7:53] apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety
[7:57] not with broided hair or gold or pearl
[8:00] sir costly array but which becometh
[8:04] women professing godliness with good
[8:09] works and one call your attention again
[8:12] to the first part of this quote that we
[8:15] began with a while ago a few weeks ago I
[8:17] was in Division I was standing up on a
[8:19] high place I was to see the preview of
[8:21] the church now notice coming of a
[8:23] sending more like this facing the West
[8:25] and coming this way was this lovely
[8:28] bunch of women real nice dress long hair
[8:33] fix nice in the back sleeves and skirts
[8:37] down neatly they were all in a marching
[8:41] tune like onward Christian soldiers
[8:47] marching as to war what what nation what
[8:55] empire
[8:56] what ruler would dress their soldiers
[9:01] like this neat skirts long hair sleeves
[9:08] decent who in the right mind would ever
[9:12] send anybody out dress up this unless of
[9:16] course they were combating Jezebel
[9:19] spirits
[9:20] [Music]
[9:26] praise the Lord
[9:29] let's bow our heads together father we
[9:32] love you tonight we ask your blessings
[9:35] on the service Lord now you speak to us
[9:38] dear God from your word how we
[9:40] appreciate your truth father help us I
[9:43] pray Lord that we can be the kind of
[9:46] people that will match this vision
[9:49] currently dear God in Jesus name the
[9:52] Saint said god bless you may be seated I
[9:57] want to use for a thought tonight
[9:59] marching as to war now you might wonder
[10:04] what in the world would modesty and
[10:07] sobriety and shamefacedness and all of
[10:12] that have anything to do with the war
[10:14] but it truly it would depend upon the
[10:17] setting of the war this would not be
[10:20] something that the United States Army
[10:22] would certainly send out our soldiers in
[10:24] it's not only saying that Russia would
[10:27] choose it's not anything that most of
[10:28] the nations of the world would choose
[10:31] but this is something that heaven chose
[10:34] and we realized that this day that we're
[10:38] living that most people think that there
[10:41] are no religious ceremonial symbols as
[10:46] Christians that we are to keep basically
[10:50] Christianity is based upon one simple
[10:53] thing - the way that the majority of
[10:55] Christendom would look at it and that is
[10:58] on the basis of what you accept it's not
[11:01] what you do it's not the way you live
[11:03] it's not the way you talk it's not the
[11:05] way you dress but it's what you accept
[11:08] so you accept Christ and Christ does
[11:12] everything else for you he does you're
[11:15] living right for you he does everything
[11:17] for you
[11:18] so it's not really based upon you and
[11:21] how do and your faithfulness or your
[11:24] desire to live for God but it's what you
[11:26] accept and then if you accept Christ
[11:28] then basically you don't have to do
[11:31] anything else but of course that's a lie
[11:34] [Music]
[11:35] the New Testament is filled with all
[11:38] kinds of things that we as Christians
[11:39] have to do and if we love and we will do
[11:43] it now let's read if you would in
[11:46] Matthew chapter 26 verse 26 notice the
[11:52] Lord Jesus now ceremonial symbols can
[11:56] reflect great stories great things that
[12:00] contain in them it may look like a
[12:04] natural observance it may look like
[12:07] something that a person is doing and
[12:10] then you try to interconnect what it
[12:13] would mean spiritually and the untrained
[12:16] carnal mind would look at it and never
[12:19] quite make the link but yet it's the way
[12:22] that God chooses to do things now
[12:24] they're setting at the table now the the
[12:26] supper table and as they were eating
[12:29] Jesus took bread and blessed it and
[12:32] brake it and gave it to the disciples
[12:34] and said take eat this is my body now is
[12:41] this literal answer me is this literal
[12:47] is this bread literally his body how
[12:51] come he didn't explain it now what's
[12:56] this Jesus giving them a ceremonial
[12:59] symbol which we keep to this day but
[13:03] when we walk up here and take that
[13:05] little piece of bread and that little
[13:07] bit of wine are we literally eating the
[13:10] body of Jesus no I stood several years
[13:14] ago killing our brother George Smith
[13:15] down in Mexico City and a massive
[13:18] massive Catholic Church and watch that
[13:21] priest stand up there by his prayer and
[13:26] supposedly through the power of James
[13:28] situation however they say that bigger
[13:30] word change that bread and wine into
[13:33] what then poor people thought was the
[13:36] literal body of Jesus Christ
[13:39] but yet we know that it is not the
[13:42] literal body but we take it with
[13:44] reverence as if though it were right so
[13:48] it is a ceremonial symbol which to us is
[13:53] more than just a symbol so let me and
[13:56] say holy is it holy
[13:58] we reverence it we look forward to it
[14:01] only to the time and we can take it but
[14:03] yet are we literally taking the body of
[14:05] Jesus no we're not are we literally
[14:07] drinking his blood when we drink the
[14:09] wine we are not but yet the Lord Jesus
[14:11] set it forth as a ceremonial symbol
[14:15] which is carried out naturally but has a
[14:18] spiritual significance that keep this in
[14:21] mind now with what we just heard about
[14:23] the vision now remember a preview is
[14:27] something that is going to be shown so
[14:29] by the man was standing here there is a
[14:31] supernatural being standing by him and
[14:33] he's going to see sings in the form of a
[14:37] symbol so when he turns what does he see
[14:41] sees a bride coming through it is a
[14:44] multiracial bride multicultural bride so
[14:48] he sees them and they're looking
[14:49] different and dressed a little bit
[14:51] different but they all were dressed
[14:53] modestly even though they might have
[14:55] been from different parts of the world
[14:57] but they all had one air about them and
[14:59] that was modesty shamefacedness and
[15:02] sobriety there was not one of them with
[15:05] cut hair not one of them with pants or a
[15:09] miniskirt or whatever voice I don't
[15:12] believe that i don't really care nothing
[15:14] about talking to you then i'm talking to
[15:16] believers tonight now i realize we've
[15:18] had some lot i'ts that have been
[15:21] streaming these services on winds then
[15:23] they took a real interest in it I'm glad
[15:25] maybe someone would get saved
[15:28] you keep hoping there will anyway so I
[15:32] realize they probably won't enjoy this
[15:34] tonight but I figure the Abraham i'ts
[15:36] will LA tights and sodomites now they
[15:40] won't care for too well
[15:41] now whenever brother branham sees this
[15:44] sin he actually sees several symbols in
[15:47] the vision so the army of God is
[15:50] represented not as preachers in this
[15:54] vision the symbol is represented he
[15:56] don't see apostles prophets evangelists
[15:59] pastors and teachers he doesn't see men
[16:01] deacons he doesn't see men trustees he
[16:03] doesn't see man passes men advances but
[16:05] God chooses to represent the bride in
[16:08] the feminist form so here's the whole
[16:12] army of God represented in the form of
[16:15] women God and what are they doing they
[16:21] are marching they are marching they are
[16:25] so antenna what you notice they are so
[16:27] in tune in this vision now the first
[16:30] group if you notice when he sees them
[16:32] they go marching out not marching up but
[16:35] the last group of the bride was so in
[16:38] tune the music never even changed when
[16:42] they changed they were so in harmony was
[16:46] the word that they was walking living a
[16:49] godly life a holy life and all of a
[16:51] sudden the step so two getting higher
[16:53] and higher and higher and higher the
[16:56] music never changed to a heavenly chord
[16:59] but they was walking there every day
[17:01] godly holy lives and they walked right
[17:04] out of this world oh man that's the kind
[17:11] of person I'm gonna be by God's grace
[17:13] now once it's so in this you'll find
[17:16] that that this vision is very very
[17:19] scriptural it follows exactly the types
[17:22] of God now what's in verse 27 Jesus he
[17:26] took the cup and gave thanks gave it to
[17:28] them saying drink ye all of it for this
[17:31] is my blood is it
[17:36] you arguing with it it is but in ain't
[17:45] and remember it is but it a it is
[17:49] symbolically so in a ceremonial symbol
[17:53] it is the blood all about you every time
[17:55] I press that little cup to my lips
[17:57] brother it's a sacred time to me when I
[18:00] take that little piece of bread it's a
[18:02] sacred time I watch kill make it
[18:04] sometimes I smell it but the JD gets the
[18:06] wine I know all of that but somehow when
[18:09] we come into his presence and what it
[18:11] represents and you know it's so sad for
[18:14] him that people do not understand that
[18:16] hair and clothes and the way you do in
[18:19] the way you live it's also in the same
[18:21] way Oh God looks on the heart I know he
[18:23] does but there are things that God wants
[18:26] the heart to be obedient to so God looks
[18:29] on the heart says that Mima don't get
[18:31] taken in Ian now watch how Paul picks
[18:36] this set for first Corinthians chapter
[18:37] 11 verse 23 for I've received of the
[18:40] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[18:41] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[18:43] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[18:46] when he had given thanks he brake it and
[18:48] said take eat this is my body which is
[18:53] broken for you now but like for you to
[18:56] show me where Jesus said that this do in
[19:04] remembrance of me I would also like for
[19:06] you to show me where Jesus said that
[19:12] testing one two three so you mean to
[19:17] tell me that Paul rephrased added to
[19:21] reshaped what Jesus had to say
[19:32] well I guess I'm out so close now y'all
[19:35] didn't notice in verse 25 I feel the
[19:41] same manner also he took the cup when he
[19:44] had supped saying this cup is the New
[19:47] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[19:52] as ye drink it
[19:54] jesus never says that Jesus never says
[19:59] this oft as you drink it well sure you
[20:02] can go home and check now unless you're
[20:03] not brother David he's got his right
[20:04] there you can check me around now sure
[20:08] check it out
[20:09] sure you Luddites check me out and when
[20:14] you're done done check and you'll find
[20:16] its soul why is this man not saying word
[20:21] for word what the Lord Jesus said so I
[20:26] guess we should trash the Bible right
[20:28] should we put it up on our websites well
[20:33] praise the Lord now what's it for salty
[20:37] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[20:39] shew the Lord's yes they come so you
[20:41] need to tell me whenever I take that
[20:44] bread and I take that wine I am actually
[20:46] showing the Lord's death power by eating
[20:52] a piece of bread and by drinking that
[20:55] much wine in the bottom of the cup that
[20:57] big I am showing Lord just how in a
[21:01] ceremonial symbol so it means more than
[21:05] what you see you see one thing but it
[21:09] contains volumes every time you woke up
[21:12] here and do that you are showing the
[21:14] Lord's death you may not even say it I'm
[21:17] showing the Lord's that don't you
[21:19] understand when we dress a certain way
[21:21] when we live a certain way it's more
[21:23] than just the outside it's more than
[21:27] what people look at is
[21:28] objecting something else well for
[21:38] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[21:40] the cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[21:43] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[21:45] Lord so if a person comes up in the
[21:47] living hypocritical life they actually
[21:49] enter into a condemnation by eating that
[21:52] bread and drinking that wine it's only a
[21:54] simple but it's a holy symbol now arts
[22:04] let's look at another ceremonial symbol
[22:06] that we keep before true believers that
[22:09] has so much more of a significance and
[22:11] what it would appear acts 22:16
[22:14] now why tarriest thou arise and be
[22:18] baptized wash away thy sins calling on
[22:23] the name of the Lord I thought it was
[22:26] the blood that washed our sins away what
[22:33] are you folks is quiet tonight
[22:39] can't you say friends folks without
[22:41] understanding its pitiful really it's
[22:43] pitiful so here Paul is instructing and
[22:47] that they're giving instruction in the
[22:49] New Testament to arise and wash away thy
[22:53] sin so there is a symbol then in keeping
[22:56] water baptism now if a person has not
[22:58] been washed by the blood of the Lord
[23:00] Jesus no water can wash your sins away
[23:02] but what does the water do the water
[23:05] answers to a clear conscience that your
[23:08] sins have been eliminated by the blood
[23:11] but symbolically you are keeping a
[23:14] ceremonial symbol which signifies more
[23:17] than just your body getting wet well
[23:20] will not swim and do the same thing Oh
[23:23] what if you just go jump in the lake and
[23:26] say well I'm gonna jump in the lake I'm
[23:27] gonna wash my sins well it's not the
[23:28] same thing if somebody don't stand there
[23:31] and side baptize you in the name of the
[23:33] Lord Jesus Christ it's not the same
[23:35] thing what difference is
[23:36] I'm not sure I know well how could that
[23:41] day I'm not sure I can explain it to you
[23:43] but it's just true that's just the way
[23:46] it is so you mean I'm supposed to do
[23:49] that even though I can't explain it
[23:51] right I'm supposed to believe that I'm
[23:54] supposed to be baptized even I don't
[23:55] feel different right why it is a
[23:58] ceremonial symbol given to us to believe
[24:01] down through the ages and we do it but
[24:05] yet when were baptized it's more than
[24:08] what we're seeing clothes are more than
[24:16] what you see clothes project attitudes
[24:24] they project spirits motives objectives
[24:29] [Applause]
[24:32] what's in Romans chapter 6 verse 4
[24:34] therefore we are buried with him by
[24:36] baptism into death we are buried with
[24:42] him by baptism what is this a ceremonial
[24:46] symbol that actually takes the real
[24:48] believer now there's many people that
[24:50] get baptized in water that never this
[24:52] never becomes real to them because all
[24:54] it is is a tradition but when a real
[24:56] believer goes in this water and they
[24:58] have an understanding they know they're
[25:00] entering into the grave with the Lord
[25:03] Jesus amen when they come up out of that
[25:06] watery grave they're coming out of the
[25:08] tone with the Lord Jesus so they're
[25:14] doing one thing and look you're looking
[25:16] at it in with comprehends all my praise
[25:18] a lot but there is something far deeper
[25:20] than what we are seeing with the eyes
[25:27] therefore we are buried with him by
[25:29] baptism into death and as Christ was
[25:32] raised from the dead by the glory of the
[25:34] Father even so we should walk in the
[25:36] newness of life for if we have been
[25:39] planted together in the likeness of his
[25:41] death we shall also notice them the
[25:44] likeness of his resurrection
[25:46] so whenever the brothers or myself bring
[25:49] somebody up out of that water you don't
[25:51] seem the natural side they went down
[25:53] John come up well but there's more to it
[25:55] than that if I really believe they have
[25:58] rise to a new life so it is a ceremonial
[26:05] symbol which case a diverse meaning
[26:09] other than what you see now this is
[26:11] something that folks missed when it
[26:12] comes to women having long hair men
[26:14] having short hair women dressing a
[26:17] certain way men dressing a certain way
[26:18] oh my God looks on the heart and it
[26:20] don't make any difference that God what
[26:21] you were that's a lot and if you listen
[26:24] this Jews number right here brother been
[26:25] talking about them pastors that don't
[26:27] tell them women it's wrong for them to
[26:28] wear pants and all that he said he'll
[26:30] suffer in the regions of the lost I
[26:40] don't believe it argued with God then
[26:45] what's this in Colossians 2:12 berry was
[26:48] him in baptism wherein also ye are risen
[26:51] with him through the faith of the
[26:54] operation of God who has raised him from
[26:56] the dead so a ceremonial symbol can only
[27:00] be ceremonial to some but to others who
[27:03] kid that it is so much more than what
[27:06] you see in the water it is something
[27:08] that they've experienced a change
[27:10] they've experienced in their life and
[27:12] they are carrying out the natural part
[27:14] which answers to a deeper counterpart so
[27:17] the bride looking at appearing in this
[27:19] vision seeing her with long hair and
[27:22] long dresses and holy and identified
[27:24] with the Word of God as far as what God
[27:26] calls as modest it means more than just
[27:28] a bunch of women run around
[27:30] Russ's it is a symbolism out symbolism
[27:33] of her chastity and her purity and her
[27:36] virginity to cross the word James v
[27:42] tells us that if there's any sick call
[27:46] the elders of the church let ulm anoint
[27:49] them with oil what for they got a valve
[27:54] stuck they've got a screw that's rested
[27:59] they got a bolt that needs to be
[28:01] loosened up I remember my brother and
[28:05] told us that a man who's not gifted to
[28:08] pray for the sick that all stands
[28:10] between him and that demon but he was
[28:13] gifted to pray for the sick he nor
[28:15] necessarily we have to use it Jesus
[28:16] never used it notice James didn't say
[28:20] call the preachers he said call the
[28:21] elders so some of y'all wonder why don't
[28:25] use all all the time I got a gift that
[28:27] stands between the mana devil they got
[28:30] your Norrington with all wah so do we
[28:34] have healing wall in this pulpit do I
[28:37] need to start bothering and selling it
[28:40] what is a symbol it is a ceremony
[28:43] assemble so an elder that does not have
[28:45] a gift to cast out Devils mother anoint
[28:48] the sick was a tall and it will stand
[28:51] between him and that disease much finer
[28:55] how can I know more than you can but if
[28:58] he prays for them or they pray the
[29:00] oldest pray the other and if they've
[29:02] even committed in his sin God will go
[29:05] ahead and take care of the sin while
[29:06] he's praying for their sickness talking
[29:10] about a double package now it's the same
[29:15] whenever we look deeper and deeper into
[29:18] the Word of God other the symbols of
[29:20] ceremonial symbols and things that God
[29:22] commands for us to do now you know even
[29:24] with the appearance and looks of
[29:26] something that's so difficult for so
[29:28] many people always has been
[29:29] they yet it seems to be getting worse
[29:31] and worse says Laodicea gets a death
[29:34] grip on the church and people will look
[29:36] I said what difference does it make if a
[29:38] man has
[29:38] long hair or a woman has short hair
[29:40] lipstick and makeup repair what
[29:42] difference does that make they totally
[29:44] miss the whole concept of homes well
[29:50] praise the Lord
[29:51] what's this in first Corinthians 11:3
[29:54] but I would have you know that the head
[29:56] of every man is Christ and the head of
[29:58] the woman is the man and the head of
[30:01] Christ is God and every man praying or
[30:04] prophesying having his head covered
[30:06] dishonoureth his head and the church
[30:11] said every woman that prayers or
[30:14] prophesy was her head uncovered
[30:17] dishonours her head which is her husband
[30:21] this is why as a rock to put away in
[30:24] divorce praise the Lord
[30:31] what difference does it make you're
[30:33] missing the symbol the symbol that lays
[30:36] beneath the power of the hair for a man
[30:41] to come in and have a long hair looking
[30:43] like a woman he is rebelling against his
[30:46] head which is Christ for a woman that
[30:49] cut hers off she's rebelling against
[30:52] God's original work although her husband
[30:54] wants me to I can believe that
[30:57] for some men I can believe that it's
[31:00] still wrong even if your husband wants
[31:02] you to do
[31:02] [Applause]
[31:12] praise the Lord
[31:14] first a woman be not covered and it also
[31:16] be shorn if it is shame for a woman to
[31:19] be shorn or shaven let her be covered
[31:20] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[31:23] head for as much as he is the image and
[31:25] God what difference does that make
[31:28] so if I come here tonight with a cowboy
[31:31] hat on I've done wrong if I come out
[31:35] here tonight and preach with a cowboy
[31:38] I've done wrong yes I've done wrong why
[31:42] I dishonored my head not this my head
[31:52] wha my hair being cut shows my
[31:57] submission to my head
[31:59] my wife's being long shows her
[32:02] submission to me what is it a symbolic
[32:09] but what don't understand symbols love
[32:14] understands cake walks blood understands
[32:18] supper before church on Wednesday night
[32:21] cold black coffee down in the basement
[32:23] or whatever more that's what lot
[32:25] understand
[32:27] I would advise some of you folks to
[32:31] start putting on your websites how to
[32:33] survive in the tribulation because if
[32:39] you go in the rapture you will go
[32:41] through this message no other way
[32:51] oh thank you Jesus
[32:56] Louis from then I'll not to cover his
[32:58] head for as much as he is in the image
[33:00] and glory God but the woman is the glory
[33:02] of the man for the man is not of the
[33:07] woman but the woman of the man that can
[33:09] remember keep the ceremonial symbol in
[33:10] your mind in order to make it all run in
[33:12] continuity is the bread the body no is
[33:16] the blood the line we trace the literal
[33:19] blood no but it symbolizes what's our
[33:21] talking about it symbolizes position and
[33:24] authority and Submission or it also
[33:27] symbolizes rebellion notice now neither
[33:35] was the man created for the woman but
[33:37] the woman for the man for this cause
[33:39] ought the woman to have power power
[33:44] power on her head so on the woman has
[33:52] long hair she's got some kind of power
[33:53] that if you run your fingers it's the
[34:02] same word as actually you shall receive
[34:04] exclusive Authority so when the woman is
[34:09] lining up to the image of God that he
[34:12] wants for her she has authority in her
[34:15] position can't you see the bride in the
[34:18] vision she was standing there in a place
[34:20] of authority under her headship Christ
[34:25] our head shall paint brother Branham our
[34:28] headship paint on Eurasia our head chef
[34:30] paint another preacher our headship as
[34:32] Christ iron
[34:35] exclusio will challenge our bodies verse
[34:48] 14 does not nature itself even teach you
[34:50] that if a man have long heads to Shaymin
[34:52] to him but if a woman have long hair it
[34:55] is a glory to her for her hairs given to
[34:59] her for a covering all of those of you
[35:05] that are called and brother Bentham a
[35:06] false prophet and a liar
[35:08] God is obligated to prove what you're
[35:10] saying if you're telling the truth
[35:13] God always vindicates his word signs
[35:18] will follow you to prove what you're
[35:21] saying I'll challenge any of your all of
[35:27] you get all of you together let's find
[35:31] two of the meanest demon-possessed
[35:33] people in the United States or Canada
[35:35] I'll go in one room with one of them and
[35:38] all of y'all can go in the room with the
[35:40] other and let's see who comes out alive
[35:46] don't show me your mouse don't show me
[35:50] your words show me your power
[35:53] show me your power easy to sit down and
[35:57] type this and Tata you yellow-bellied
[35:59] coward you don't just say it prove it
[36:02] who that your God is right know that
[36:06] your God is supernatural prove that your
[36:08] Jesus is the rival for what you're
[36:11] saying or shut up
[36:15] oh you say but I named fair you're a
[36:30] preacher it don't make no difference
[36:32] when you go to heaven the word you ain't
[36:33] no preacher you're handling the world
[36:35] life pressures come on cast out devils
[36:37] our preachers heal the sick raise the
[36:39] dead you're out of your place on that so
[36:41] come on let's walk on water together
[36:43] [Applause]
[36:52] some of your poor ignorant message
[36:54] people let a bunch of these people bleed
[36:56] you away from the truth they ain't got
[36:58] one sign they ain't got one miracle Bank
[37:00] got one we you know why you're powerless
[37:02] to Isis where's the supernatural to
[37:06] prove what they're say define God's
[37:08] prophet and say was going to hell he's
[37:10] in Hell tonight there say it and lost
[37:12] with that God then God's obligated to
[37:14] stand behind them and back up what
[37:16] they're saying but of course God
[37:19] wouldn't do that cuz that would make him
[37:20] like them know what let's look at
[37:27] symbols now of clothing symbols of
[37:31] clothing I said 47:2 says take the
[37:35] millstone and grind meal uncover thy
[37:38] locks make bear the leg uncover the
[37:42] thigh pass over the rivers thy nakedness
[37:47] shall be uncovered
[37:49] yea the shame shall be seen now listen
[37:53] how nakedness is uncovered take the
[37:56] millstone grime ill uncover thy locks
[37:58] make bear the leg uncover the thigh does
[38:06] everybody here know what your thighs
[38:09] you know where it starts and where it
[38:11] ends from here down to here mid knee
[38:18] someone when a woman wears a dress above
[38:22] that she's showing her nakedness and if
[38:28] it's so short but she sets down it don't
[38:29] go over her knees and she pulls Paul
[38:31] Ephraim Esther she's still naked i
[38:33] [Applause]
[38:40] nakedness she'll be uncovered yeah that
[38:42] shame she'll be seen I will take
[38:43] vengeance I will not meet thee as a man
[38:46] I will not meet thee as a man now watch
[38:50] this let me read this to you from from
[38:52] Kaufman's Bible commentary there was a
[38:55] woman who wanted to cross the river God
[38:57] wanted to disgrace the woman if you read
[38:58] the text in Isaiah chapter 47
[39:00] you'll see why he commanded her to walk
[39:02] across the river then to lift up her
[39:04] skirt so high that her thigh would show
[39:07] now what God is disgracing this nation
[39:11] he's going to make them cross the river
[39:13] into tribulation and what they're going
[39:16] to do they're going to be shamed as they
[39:18] cross they're going into shame and
[39:20] they're going to be shamed as they cross
[39:21] so here's Israel or these nations that
[39:23] are dressed as a clean and they're going
[39:25] to have to take because the water's
[39:27] going to come up on the legs so they'll
[39:28] have to take their dress their princess
[39:30] gown whatever it is and raise it up now
[39:33] what's this and God said that when her
[39:35] thigh was exposed she would be naked and
[39:38] her shame would be revealed we read that
[39:41] she was told to uncover the locks and
[39:43] make the let bear the leg uncover the
[39:45] thigh and I'm nakedness shall be
[39:47] uncovered where she would have to wait
[39:49] them exposing her legs or in cases even
[39:53] deeper water lifting her skirt to reveal
[39:55] her nakedness of course now they don't
[40:00] do to cross rivers they did to go to
[40:01] Walmart
[40:06] now remember ceremonial symbol but I
[40:10] don't think it's naked but you're not
[40:12] God so what you think
[40:18] doesn't really matter this is what God
[40:21] said are you gonna be so foolish you
[40:24] would argue with God there's only one
[40:28] being I know that do that and that's the
[40:30] devil I guess that makes you a gentleman
[40:34] the uncovering of the thigh and the
[40:38] lifting of skirts were considered to be
[40:41] revealing ones nakedness behold I am
[40:45] against essential hope of the host I
[40:46] will uncover the skirts upon thy face I
[40:48] will show the nation's on nakedness and
[40:51] the kingdoms of that shame Nahum chapter
[40:52] 3 verse 5 hmm so showing the fire his
[41:00] nakedness
[41:02] dear Lord is in anyone who went below
[41:06] them saw the ancient church and the
[41:09] American church that they were naked had
[41:13] grave stuff in front of them about
[41:15] elephant skin and they were going along
[41:18] lasting what is it simple but the thing
[41:23] that is they didn't think there's naked
[41:24] but that's the way God saw notice bare
[41:30] the leg uncovered the thigh Passover the
[41:32] rivers the idea here is that of lifting
[41:34] up the long training of the Royal robe
[41:35] in order to pass through the rivers
[41:36] going into slavery in captivity she
[41:39] would be ashamed to bear her legs to
[41:41] cross the streams for she would be
[41:42] exposed to public view as a common
[41:46] person dake so what does that make women
[41:52] of this day then Adam and Eve had on fig
[42:00] leaves but still felt naked
[42:05] so it's not just the clothes you have on
[42:08] but its what those clothes cover and the
[42:14] answer them both are hoping and they
[42:15] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[42:17] fig leaves together made themselves
[42:18] aprons and the heard the voice of the
[42:21] Lord God walking in the garden the cool
[42:23] of the day and Adam and his wife hid
[42:24] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[42:26] God amongst the trees of the garden and
[42:27] the Lord God called him to Adam and
[42:29] selling him were our town and he said I
[42:33] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[42:34] afraid because I was naked how could you
[42:38] be naked with fig leaves on glory ouch
[42:48] Oh me what's this in 1st Samuel chapter
[42:54] 19 verse 24 when Saul had put off his
[42:56] Karim upper garment he has said to have
[43:00] been naked David went girded only with a
[43:03] linen ephod is said to have been
[43:06] uncovered 2nd Samuel 6:14 now you and I
[43:10] get in our mind start raving naked but
[43:12] not one stitch of clothes on that's not
[43:14] the Bible terms John 21 7 therefore that
[43:21] disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter
[43:23] it is the Lord
[43:24] now I'm Simon Peter heard it was the
[43:26] Lord he got his Fisher's code unto him
[43:28] for he was naked but not naked like you
[43:33] think once this born says he was naked
[43:37] he was undressed with nothing on but the
[43:39] undergarment our tunic so he had on his
[43:43] under clothes but that was considered
[43:46] naked without the Fisher's coat on quite
[43:50] a shape for a preacher to be anything
[43:55] now you're going to argue with the Bible
[44:01] well glory the word does not require us
[44:04] to suppose a greater degree of nakedness
[44:07] and this but yet people that think of
[44:08] the layout of sutures when God said your
[44:10] wretched your nakedness
[44:31] in God's eyes you're naked so if Peter
[44:41] had been on his under clothes made him
[44:43] naked now I wonder what that makes folks
[44:45] in this day who basically were under
[44:46] clothes out in public we realized that
[44:53] we could revert it back in time to what
[44:55] the law the cops the police women were
[44:57] taught years ago what they would have
[44:59] arrested people for 50 years ago we
[45:02] wouldn't have enough jails in prison to
[45:03] house all of them because the majority
[45:06] population especially in America would
[45:08] be in prison for nakedness they would
[45:11] wrote them tickets years ago for the way
[45:13] people go to church and today then wrote
[45:16] tickets and throw them in jail they
[45:18] would have arrested them for indecent
[45:20] exposure I'm not sure that even know how
[45:22] to describe that today companion book
[45:32] notes says that this way nope
[45:34] naked the Greek word goon knows this
[45:37] means he had only on his tunic or his
[45:40] undergarment so the man brother BAM said
[45:45] who are shorts that's a woman's
[45:47] undergarment Lord shall have mercy
[45:51] golems
[45:55] he said the Son of God trucking down the
[45:58] street a pair of shorts on he said not
[45:59] know some of God he said mom so
[46:03] denomination I'll give you the initials
[46:04] of it bsas big sister society big
[46:09] society you made with him now I know you
[46:11] disagree million there but that's
[46:13] exactly the first
[46:15] [Applause]
[46:21] now watch Jesus carried the same
[46:24] biblical thought of nakedness Matthew
[46:28] 25:35 I was in hunger then you gave me
[46:31] meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink
[46:32] I was a stranger and you took me in
[46:35] naked and you clothed me naked and you
[46:41] clothed me let's look at this Greek word
[46:42] goodness ill-clad clad and undergarments
[46:47] only the outer garments are quote being
[46:50] laid aside to be lightly or poorly clad
[46:54] not start naked you understand but to be
[46:58] poorly clad too low and too high come on
[47:10] church don't get quiet my lord if I
[47:12] didn't know about other things some of
[47:13] your sister said some of the stuff at
[47:14] home in the closet there was this so big
[47:20] jesus said that whenever I was ill
[47:22] Claire
[47:23] you come not that they were sitting
[47:25] there totally naked and everything have
[47:26] nothing but they were ill Claire the
[47:28] outer garment was gone the outer garment
[47:32] was gone and they had on their
[47:33] undergarments praise the Lord
[47:41] same word revelation 16:15 behold I come
[47:44] as a thief
[47:44] blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth
[47:46] his garments lest he walk heel out and
[47:50] they see his shame can't you see the way
[47:53] God is going to look on the layer to see
[47:55] in church can't you see all these folks
[47:58] that have left the message and stripped
[48:00] their clothes off and found this new
[48:02] freedom can't you see the way God looks
[48:05] at him he looks at him as being naked
[48:08] and shaking their body and being vulgar
[48:11] and filthy and dancing to rock and roll
[48:14] but rather than intially sees the bride
[48:17] he sees the bride marching alone
[48:20] Christian soldier marching as to war
[48:26] what are we fighting with her long hair
[48:28] and modest clothing our attitude right
[48:32] lord before God being dressed the way he
[48:35] wants us to be
[48:36] [Applause]
[48:39] why because it is a warfare our world in
[48:43] it so we're fighting revelation 17 16
[48:54] and the ten horns the south souls upon
[48:56] the beasts they shall hate the and
[48:58] shall make her desolate and naked same
[49:03] word ill-clad now what's clothing can
[49:08] also reflect the spiritual symbol as
[49:11] they're 61 3 to appoint unto them that
[49:14] mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty
[49:17] for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning
[49:19] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[49:23] heaviness so you then were talking about
[49:25] a person's attitude but it is symbolized
[49:29] by closing so then that they would be
[49:32] down and they would be heaven all
[49:34] burdened down but God would give them a
[49:37] garment of praise well I need that
[49:40] garment every now and then don't you I
[49:42] need to change clothes sometimes I get
[49:44] that old spirit of heaviness omnia you
[49:46] know all the things you deal with in the
[49:47] world God say here go slip this on sign
[49:50] what is it it symbolizes something that
[49:53] we put on and we take that other one off
[49:56] he don't put that garment of praise over
[49:58] the top of that other one but he wants
[50:00] us to get rid of that thing so I can put
[50:01] this one on that they might be called
[50:06] the trees of righteousness the planting
[50:07] of the Lord that he might be glorified
[50:09] as their 6110 I will greatly rejoice in
[50:12] the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my
[50:14] god for he hath clothed me with the
[50:17] garments of salvation he has covered me
[50:21] with the robe of righteousness as a
[50:24] bridegroom
[50:25] himself with all of us has abroad of
[50:28] Dawn herself with her Jo I performed a
[50:41] lot of weddings in my years
[50:43] first when I performed I was about 18 19
[50:46] years old I'm not saying that it
[50:50] couldn't happen but all the ones I've
[50:53] ever seen the only one who ever come to
[50:56] the wedding with a wedding dress on
[50:59] what's the bride now some of the guests
[51:05] have come in and they'll have their
[51:06] black gothic garb on and the others will
[51:09] be dressed up like Country and Western
[51:10] you know whatever others will come in
[51:12] with their orange on because they're a
[51:14] UT fan and people wants to wear what
[51:16] they are it's race week so you know if
[51:19] you got a wedding this weekend they're
[51:20] probably gonna come in with NASCAR and
[51:22] you know all them other types of folks
[51:24] because they're wearing what they love
[51:27] come on now but who comes in with the
[51:30] wedding dress on the bride and many
[51:32] times the bride will be in white and the
[51:35] others are being pink or blue or mint or
[51:38] chiffon or whatever more they dress a
[51:41] different color you guests come here
[51:42] your dress different can't you see why
[51:44] the bride must dress and act and look
[51:47] different from the world we are not the
[51:50] guests of this wedding haha oh my god we
[51:54] are not the visitors at this wedding
[51:56] we are the waters getting cry so we've
[52:01] got a dress different than the rest of
[52:03] us we've got a restaurant
[52:06] [Applause]
[52:14] it's not fitting for the bride to have
[52:18] them scarlet or purple
[52:26] [Applause]
[52:27] but fine linen clean and avoid Lord God
[52:41] Lord Jesus he has clothed them of the
[52:44] garments of salvation he have cover me
[52:47] with the robe of righteousness as a
[52:49] bridegroom deckard himself with his
[52:51] ornaments as a bride adorned as herself
[52:53] their jewels isaiah 64:6 but we are all
[52:58] as an unclean thing all our
[53:01] righteousness are filthy rags you agree
[53:09] with this so then your clothes can
[53:13] reflect where you are spiritually all
[53:19] right don't matter what you wear really
[53:22] so how many people have you seen women
[53:25] on the latest people's magazine or
[53:28] cosmopolitan or where are those
[53:29] magazines are open every checkout and
[53:31] they look like you long hair long
[53:36] dresses big long skirts
[53:40] what if clothes don't matter I mean you
[53:43] know that there are who they are without
[53:44] the clothes I don't think they're not
[53:48] they are who they are coupled with the
[53:51] clothes
[53:53] [Applause]
[53:54] some of them Jensen as you will name
[53:56] recognize them if they dress like you
[53:59] what's-her-face probably scare the liver
[54:01] out of you
[54:02] [Music]
[54:04] you understand that me the movie stars
[54:07] actually didn't like the idea with
[54:10] television and movies going
[54:11] high-definition because it would show
[54:14] their bumps and blemishes and scars and
[54:20] they want you to think they're perfect
[54:23] they want you to model after them all my
[54:25] lord can you imagine all the modelling
[54:26] clay and all the paintings taking this
[54:28] you know this ender they have to do to
[54:30] make them look perfect so they make
[54:31] everything high-definition listen
[54:32] brother
[54:33] this word is multi high-definition you
[54:37] got to get your own layer to see a
[54:39] makeup up cuz it's gonna show all your
[54:40] falls it's gonna show all your acne
[54:43] bumps it's gonna show all your worldly
[54:44] ways everything at it my let me come
[54:47] before that line right now and show up
[54:49] all of my spots and all my blemishes so
[54:51] I can get them all to Carol so and I'll
[54:54] still know that day he'll look at me and
[54:55] say you're perfect you're perfect
[54:58] [Applause]
[55:05] what's this second Corinthians five 114
[55:07] or Ferris a House of this Tabernacle
[55:08] where does L we have a building of God
[55:10] in house not made with hands eternal in
[55:12] the heavens
[55:13] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[55:15] to be clothed upon with our house which
[55:18] was from heaven if so be notice being
[55:21] cold we shall not be found naked
[55:27] do you understand those who go into the
[55:29] sixth dimension or the fifth dimension
[55:31] of the lost
[55:32] they have no theophany body spiritually
[55:36] their naked their soul their souls into
[55:41] a rim on their their held but they have
[55:43] no body like the saints who go into the
[55:44] sixth image kept in the presence of God
[55:47] your new clothes is waiting for you but
[55:54] the sinners when they died their soul
[55:55] goes in there and is put into a holding
[55:57] place and in the eyes of God when they
[55:59] raise they stand before the white throne
[56:02] with no theophany the lack of us
[56:05] theophany proves but that's why when he
[56:15] steps off of that mercy seat you can
[56:17] come right out from under the throne of
[56:18] God raring and ready you can come out of
[56:23] that you're not shamed
[56:24] you're not backward you're not bashful
[56:26] ha your clouds proves you're part of the
[56:29] resurrection you have already raised
[56:31] with him you've done what he asked you
[56:33] to do your own baby's word you're not
[56:36] naked my fall either in this tabernacle
[56:42] do groan and being bird enough of that
[56:44] we would be unclothed but clothed upon
[56:47] mortality that it might be swallowed up
[56:49] of life first Peter 5:5 likewise ye
[56:52] younger submit yourselves unto the
[56:53] elderly a all of you be subject one to
[56:56] another and be closed with humility for
[57:02] God resisteth the proud and give us
[57:05] grace to the humble
[57:06] revelation 10:1 I saw another mighty
[57:08] angel come down from heaven claw
[57:11] what's the cloud the dyed garments from
[57:15] Bo's are all had been laid aside
[57:19] now this clothing is required while
[57:21] opening of the seven seals so are the
[57:25] common Southwest the same thing the
[57:28] Angels were veiled in Lord of mercy
[57:30] he calls himself a humanity to become a
[57:33] high priest and die for now he's probing
[57:35] himself with a supernatural cloud as the
[57:38] angels come down to break open the seals
[57:40] to call your name he takes on water
[57:43] climbing up a cloud revelation 17:3 so
[57:50] he carried me away in the spirit in the
[57:52] wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a
[57:54] scarlet coloured Beast full of names of
[57:57] blasphemy having seven heads and ten
[57:59] horns
[57:59] and the woman was arrayed in purple and
[58:04] scarlet colour and decked with gold and
[58:11] precious stones and pearls having a
[58:13] golden cup in her hand full of
[58:15] abominations of filthiness of her
[58:18] fornication and the power void was a
[58:21] name written Mystery Babylon the Great
[58:22] the mother the mother well if she's a
[58:29] mother she's had the memo some man
[58:33] and it wasn't God so there's only one
[58:38] other source she's been with the devil
[58:40] and her union with the devil has
[58:44] produced one harlots and prostitutes
[58:46] like herself
[58:48] [Music]
[58:52] can have a few more minutes what is the
[58:56] biblical purpose of clothing or apparel
[59:02] there are definitely things that are set
[59:04] forth in the scripture to identify what
[59:08] clothing in God's eyes are for the first
[59:12] purpose for clothing is to cover your
[59:15] nakedness of course now what's this in
[59:18] Genesis 3:21
[59:21] and unto Adam also unto his wife did the
[59:25] Lord God make coats of skins and clothed
[59:31] them now God it would not have been
[59:35] necessary had God accepted what Adam and
[59:40] Eve had done now you see I to the very
[59:44] foul of the very first man it shows his
[59:47] difference of understanding decency
[59:50] versus God's
[59:56] because in his idea decency wants to
[59:59] cover the middle I guess that's why you
[1:00:05] see folks going around the way they are
[1:00:06] today
[1:00:07] they're unregenerate foul a man they had
[1:00:11] received the Holy Ghost remember them
[1:00:13] heathens in Africa when both of em said
[1:00:15] they received Christ they said right
[1:00:17] there didn't have tops on didn't have
[1:00:18] the clothes on and all there and they
[1:00:20] would fold their arms right in the
[1:00:21] presence of those men he said because
[1:00:22] Christ structure heart right there
[1:00:24] and what about some of these heathens in
[1:00:26] America that take more off each year and
[1:00:28] we call them heathens praise the Lord
[1:00:32] now when man fell he knew that he was
[1:00:34] naked he knew there was something wrong
[1:00:36] but his definition of acceptance in the
[1:00:39] eyes of God of what was modest and
[1:00:43] acceptable as totally different than
[1:00:45] God's view friends don't you see where
[1:00:47] people are don't you see where they are
[1:00:49] that's how what God don't care this is
[1:00:51] fine this is fine Adam and Eve again but
[1:00:54] when he come in the presence of God he
[1:00:56] realized that what he had made wasn't
[1:00:59] enough so what he thought was modest
[1:01:05] before God's presence now made him naked
[1:01:08] in the presence of God can you imagine
[1:01:10] when people come up in the white throne
[1:01:12] judgment and they stand are spiritually
[1:01:13] naked Lord Jesus now once you notice on
[1:01:22] the Adam and his wife did the Lord God
[1:01:24] make coats of skins so it took more than
[1:01:31] one skin
[1:01:36] so it must not have been a micro or a
[1:01:39] mini or a rabbit living on that well the
[1:01:54] Lord God needs several skins because
[1:02:00] when the Lord God clothes his children
[1:02:02] he calls them in modesty and those who's
[1:02:13] trying to pull you away from the word
[1:02:15] let me repeat God's prophet to you don't
[1:02:17] you believe that old painted up liar all
[1:02:26] the forms will be gone tomorrow I'll
[1:02:28] take now notice on the animals on his
[1:02:35] wife the Lord God didn't make coats of
[1:02:37] skins and what's this according to
[1:02:42] Strong's dictionary the Hebrew word
[1:02:43] means a garment that went from the
[1:02:46] shoulders undoubted their chests and
[1:02:52] bats after doing this they were clothed
[1:02:56] and no longer naked now an Adam had
[1:03:00] sewed together the fig leaves for him
[1:03:02] and Eve together however was it it when
[1:03:03] he did not cover Eve's chest nor his own
[1:03:08] nor thighs I don't have to get too much
[1:03:12] plainer hopefully you'll understand but
[1:03:15] when God closes them God calls him from
[1:03:19] here down
[1:03:24] you argue with God about it lady
[1:03:28] and some of you saw tonight man I sent
[1:03:34] an adopter selfish yesterday waiting for
[1:03:35] an appointment and it's a set there they
[1:03:39] had country music going I thought Lord
[1:03:41] hammer you came go to a doctor that been
[1:03:43] that old rotten stuff and his one
[1:03:47] country music song after another I was
[1:03:49] probably there 20-30 minutes waiting for
[1:03:51] the doctor to come in check out nothing
[1:03:52] wrong with mr. don't worry some of them
[1:03:55] out there there's bet to have a spell
[1:03:56] they thought has died someone about
[1:04:00] broke out in tongues is your God he's
[1:04:02] got cancer no no so all of us sitting
[1:04:07] there this song came on and it was about
[1:04:10] a honky-tonk type of setting and it was
[1:04:14] saving about a woman coming into this
[1:04:16] honky-tonk dressed all sexy the tight
[1:04:18] clothes all all that on and the words
[1:04:21] that they kept repeating in this song
[1:04:22] over and over again was this lord have
[1:04:25] mercy
[1:04:26] how did she get to Umbridge his own and
[1:04:33] I stepped out brother Jim and I listened
[1:04:35] to that song and I thought how can
[1:04:37] people who claim to be Christians be so
[1:04:40] blind
[1:04:41] when singers and all this knows that for
[1:04:44] a woman to put on those tight britches
[1:04:46] it's nothing but a sexy symbol and
[1:04:49] Christian women will put them on and say
[1:04:51] they're modest they're deceived and I
[1:04:57] thought God the words of them songs will
[1:04:59] condemn them at the day of judgement
[1:05:01] when the very thing is that listen to it
[1:05:04] how many men go when you see a woman
[1:05:06] dressed sideways the first thing in your
[1:05:08] mind is how modest
[1:05:14] incredible
[1:05:20] the women that started wine I'm thus
[1:05:22] left this word you tell me how many at
[1:05:25] times that your husband told you how
[1:05:26] modest you look now that you're doing it
[1:05:28] or has he told you how sexy you look and
[1:05:31] how good you look
[1:05:33] what if he's looking at you and seeing
[1:05:36] that other men are saying the same thing
[1:05:38] [Applause]
[1:05:49] bless God out to you Danya reg and I
[1:05:52] can't wait to huh

[1:07:11] need to be covered to the ankle the di4
[1:07:13] down the thigh exodus 28:42 God was
[1:07:16] given instruction regarding the clothing
[1:07:18] for the priests you shall make for them
[1:07:20] linen breeches to cover their bare flesh
[1:07:22] nakedness in the King James Version they
[1:07:25] shall reach for my loins even to the
[1:07:27] thighs what was considered nakedness
[1:07:30] exposing the loin or the thigh John Gill
[1:07:33] says from the loins even to the thigh
[1:07:35] shall they reach they were to reach
[1:07:37] above the navel near the heart to the
[1:07:44] end of the thigh which is the knee and

[1:09:44] oh I'll limit you to 1,500 visions and
[1:09:51] whenever you pray for pass the Kings he

[1:10:02] might Matt listen I won't believe you
[1:10:08] but I'm not listen to rich and
[1:10:24] Christians Goods and God gave us a
[1:10:27] little preview of how he looks at it so
[1:10:31] he gets his profit and projects through
[1:10:34] his eyes did you hear I tore up by the
[1:10:38] venom was when he saw this he thought he
[1:10:41] was at fault he thought it was his fault
[1:10:49] that this was the bride
[1:10:51] he said all I've done I've been
[1:10:54] listening this choosin of a bride for
[1:10:55] the last seven eight days listen to it
[1:10:58] three four or five times a day and when
[1:11:00] you listen to it and you hear how he
[1:11:02] gets into this vision and he actually
[1:11:04] thinks it's his fault be shut up there's
[1:11:07] no need for me to even try I'm finished
[1:11:12] I'm finished out of all that I've done
[1:11:16] all that the preachers have done and
[1:11:18] this is what we present for a bride but

[1:12:18] it is appropriate it God acted down the
[1:12:22] Garden of Eden
[1:12:29] [Applause]

[1:12:58] don't you let these old painted faces
[1:13:01] Jezebel's make you feel bad now let's
[1:13:06] look at it on the basis of reasoning
[1:13:09] only what if what if God doesn't want
[1:13:15] didn't very careful women wear dresses
[1:13:17] or pants or shorts or bikinis to church
[1:13:20] or whatever don't really matter to God
[1:13:21] you wear whatever you want where then
[1:13:24] tell me what if your sisters lost by
[1:13:26] addressing visa but what if God looks at
[1:13:35] his nakedness in his ass then what have
[1:13:39] these women who do it lost everything I
[1:13:45] [Applause]

[1:15:03] have we read Ronald with his pulpit of
[1:15:05] things that our God is done you tell me
[1:15:07] that's our imagination how can my
[1:15:09] imagination raise somebody the sick and
[1:15:11] afflicted in our day no way Lord Jesus
[1:15:27] pray together Lord I pray that should
[1:15:34] make it more real to his father I don't
[1:15:38] know when I have received so many texts
[1:15:41] and so many emails about anything that
[1:15:43] I've preached preachers streaming the
[1:15:47] services on Wednesday night at Lourdes
[1:15:49] the last several winds announced before
[1:15:51] I even get back to my office texts from
[1:15:53] ministers got one from brother Tim this
[1:15:56] week they hit listen to the surface
[1:15:59] different men of God streaming or listen
[1:16:03] going back and listening Lord we know
[1:16:07] it's the time it's the time for your
[1:16:10] word to be preached oh it doesn't come
[1:16:12] without cost doesn't come without people
[1:16:15] really cool and making fun
[1:16:17] but that's to be expected lord I just
[1:16:21] pray for if there is forgiveness I pray
[1:16:25] for forgiveness all these things that
[1:16:28] are being posted in videos that are
[1:16:30] being made and you know it's nothing
[1:16:31] that outright lies I pray for your
[1:16:35] forgiveness form Lord may your mercy
[1:16:38] reach out to him I won't even call me a
[1:16:41] brother won't even refer to me as being
[1:16:44] a Christian which is pretty sad my Lord
[1:16:49] Jesus I think it's not a mistake what
[1:16:53] you're having me to deal with on
[1:16:55] Wednesday and which I made their worth
[1:16:56] on the weekend they don't understand I
[1:16:58] know they don't understand how the
[1:17:00] things that's said and go on but you do
[1:17:03] it where is me Lord you know my makeup
[1:17:07] most people that ain't around me they
[1:17:09] don't I think I enjoy preaching hard you
[1:17:13] know how that kills me Lord on Thursday
[1:17:16] I just drag around and Friday I drag
[1:17:18] around vice couple of weeks Lord I just
[1:17:21] felt so low preaching what I've been
[1:17:24] preaching the Lord I know it's the truth
[1:17:27] I know it's the truth and as a human
[1:17:32] sometimes I see things in your word and
[1:17:34] I think oh no I wish hadn't showed me
[1:17:37] that Lord it's just the human part but
[1:17:41] yet lore don't want to stand for what's
[1:17:43] right what's true you don't know how you
[1:17:47] know how many times they don't but how
[1:17:50] many times I've wished and prayed I
[1:17:51] could just be a pastor out in the sticks
[1:17:54] of Kentucky somewhere somewhere back in
[1:17:56] the backwoods and nobody know me not
[1:17:59] have no website not have nothing where
[1:18:01] people to ever hear me I just preached
[1:18:03] these same things to my little church
[1:18:04] and just the local people would hear it
[1:18:07] but for whatever reason Lord
[1:18:10] you called us to be in a different
[1:18:12] position I pray for strength for courage
[1:18:17] Lord I'm so glad you gave brother
[1:18:19] Branham this vision that we would be
[1:18:22] encouraged in the end time to be able to
[1:18:25] know that bride will come
[1:18:30] in order they know even they can make
[1:18:33] their mistakes because the last two
[1:18:34] stepped out a line he come to himself
[1:18:37] and in the room they're screaming get
[1:18:40] back in line
[1:18:41] so we know the bride can get out of line
[1:18:44] but she won't stay out of line so Lord
