[27:56] to the book of Saint Luke chapter 22
[27:58] verse 39
[27:59] a
[28:02] man we certainly loved the Lord tonight

[28:13] the balance City the Lord has just
[28:15] really blessed our brother the balance
[28:16] in the message and has just really been
[28:18] a blessing in my heart so I definitely
[28:20] appreciate that and certainly loved the
[28:22] Lord tonight amen amen Saint Luke
[28:24] chapter 22 verse 39 I'm not a good
[28:26] public speaker so we just got to start
[28:28] preaching hey man hey st. Luke chapter
[28:32] 22 verse 39 the Bible says this and he
[28:36] came out and went as he was wont to the
[28:39] mount of olives and his disciples also
[28:42] followed him and when he was at the
[28:44] place he said to them pray that ye enter
[28:46] not into temptation and he was withdrawn
[28:49] from them about a stone's cast and
[28:51] kneeled down and prayed saying father if
[28:55] thou be willing remove this cup from me
[28:57] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[29:01] done and there appeared an angel unto
[29:03] him from heaven strengthening him I just
[29:06] loved that verse right there and being
[29:09] in agony he prayed more earnestly and
[29:11] his sweat was as it were great drops of
[29:14] blood falling down to the ground and
[29:16] when he rose up from prayer and
[29:19] come to his disciples he found them
[29:20] sleeping for sorrow and said unto them
[29:23] why sleepy rise and pray lest ye enter
[29:26] into temptation I want to speak tonight
[29:29] out of verses 42 saying father if thou
[29:32] be willing remove this cup from me but
[29:35] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[29:37] done may God add the Blessed fruit of
[29:39] his word as you're seated tonight and I
[29:41] want to speak to him this thought of
[29:43] fully surrendered fully surrendered and
[29:47] brother Branham would tell us in a
[29:48] message and from that time he says God
[29:50] only wants one man he said that he can
[29:53] fully get in his complete control he
[29:56] said one man that will fully surrender
[29:59] to Him he said that's all God wants us
[30:02] to find one man that can fully surrender
[30:05] to him you know I believe tonight that
[30:07] we are as the bride of Jesus Christ must
[30:09] be a surrendered people not so much to
[30:12] the enemy that we're surrendering into
[30:14] the power of the enemy but we are
[30:15] surrendering to God and I hear brother
[30:17] Branham say this tonight I just want to
[30:19] lay a foundation if that's okay and I
[30:21] want to ask you this tonight maybe the
[30:23] question has been in many people's mind
[30:25] of what is my purpose of being here what
[30:28] is my purpose of being here but I was
[30:30] studying two messages and I heard
[30:31] brother Branham make these two
[30:32] statements and he says in leadership he
[30:34] said there's only one form of eternal
[30:36] life he said and that comes from God he
[30:39] said and he foreordained every creature
[30:41] that would ever have it just as you were
[30:44] in the gene of your father you as a gene
[30:46] in God so he says just as you were a
[30:49] gene and your father you are a gene in
[30:52] God one of his attributes to begin with
[30:54] he said or you'll never be there so the
[30:57] very evidence of why you're here tonight
[30:59] is because you had representation
[31:01] somewhere else Amen you had
[31:04] representation in another civilization
[31:07] you see we're not here tonight just just
[31:09] just people sitting on pews but we've
[31:11] got representation somewhere beyond
[31:14] Laodicea somewhere beyond the kingdoms
[31:17] of this world you've got representation
[31:19] in him
[31:21] he says now he said you'll never be
[31:23] there you come forth from the betting
[31:25] ground of your mother your father didn't
[31:26] know you you're in his loins and when
[31:28] you come forth and betting ground of the
[31:29] mother then you became a human being and
[31:31] are made in the image of your father now
[31:34] you can fellowship with him he said in
[31:36] the same thing by God so the same thing
[31:39] is happening by God he says he says now
[31:42] you can fellowship with him he said if
[31:44] you've got eternal life he said the life
[31:46] that you come in the natural after
[31:48] physical life that was by your father
[31:50] and the only way you can come born again
[31:52] is the only way it has to be from your
[31:54] heavenly Father his attributes he said
[31:57] all the father's given me will come to
[32:00] me see he said I'll not lose a one of
[32:02] them you know I take a confidence
[32:04] tonight I take assurance tonight and
[32:06] knowing that God will not lose or one of
[32:09] us he'll not leave so one of his sons
[32:11] he'll not lose a one of his daughters if
[32:14] he has placed you here tonight you are
[32:16] here on divine commission from the
[32:18] presence of Almighty God you are here by
[32:21] hand selected by God to whip every devil
[32:25] out of hell to stand against every power
[32:27] that Satan is loosed in this hour you
[32:30] see we are more than just people on the
[32:32] earth tonight we are from heaven we come
[32:35] from God and we must go back to him
[32:40] he says it like this he says see he says
[32:43] you are here I just love that you are
[32:47] here how many's here tonight you are
[32:50] here he says because your name was
[32:53] placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[32:56] there was even a foundation of the world
[32:58] he said that's exactly right your Genie
[33:01] said your spiritual gene of your
[33:03] heavenly father I love that he said is a
[33:08] part of God's Word he said that to me so
[33:11] he says I've said it like this with
[33:13] Jesus when he was here because he was
[33:15] the word now let's just this he was the
[33:20] word he said he sees that you suffered
[33:22] with him you died with him you were
[33:24] buried with him and you rose with him
[33:27] and now full glory to God and now you
[33:31] are sitting in heavenly places with him
[33:35] tonight the position of the believer
[33:38] it's not under the devils feet the
[33:41] position of the believer tonight is in
[33:44] heavenly places
[33:46] amen you know we preach a lot about
[33:49] finding our position and I believe that
[33:51] but I think we also need to tell the
[33:53] devil he's got a position
[33:56] the devil's got a position it's not in
[34:00] the heart of a believer glory to God
[34:02] it's not in the heart of a church it's
[34:05] under the feet of the bride of Jesus
[34:07] Christ I
[34:09] love this he says and then I am God who
[34:12] is rich in mercy he said and then after
[34:14] a while you heard the gospel he said
[34:16] maybe you went to church you picked out
[34:18] fits in that and went from denomination
[34:20] to denomination but one day Oh
[34:24] glory to God but one day he said you
[34:28] being a part of God he said you had to
[34:32] be a part of the word and he said and
[34:34] when you heard the word you knew where
[34:37] you come from you know what was the
[34:39] truth he said you were always
[34:43] you were always he said the seed was in
[34:47] you always you see I'm not gonna back up
[34:50] on preaching the revelation of this
[34:52] message because this is the only hope
[34:54] that we've got in Laodicea it's the
[34:57] power of representation that come from
[34:59] another kingdom that come from another
[35:01] dimension
[35:04] in the midst of such darkness in the
[35:07] midst of such confusion a theologian
[35:09] couldn't break through it but God sent a
[35:11] prophet I'd known it with the pillar of
[35:14] fire to break through denominationalism
[35:16] to break through ever spirit and bring a
[35:19] Liberty to the sons and daughters of God
[35:25] that's why we're here tonight
[35:29] glory to God
[35:31] he said you were always he said the seed
[35:35] was in you always I love this the word
[35:38] seen the word
[35:42] the word seen the word it recognized
[35:47] itself
[35:51] Christ recognized himself in a group of
[35:55] people that was born in sin shapen in
[35:58] iniquity but there was a promised seed
[36:00] somewhere that was coming to destroy the
[36:04] kingdom of Satan
[36:05] [Applause]
[36:08] if Satan was that to that seat back
[36:11] there he's after it tonight Oh
[36:14] Gouri
[36:16] nicest that was before the foundation of
[36:20] the world you saw the word and you come
[36:25] to it
[36:27] you saw the world and you come to it but
[36:32] what must you do when you come to that
[36:36] word you must surrender
[36:39] when you come to the place that God for
[36:43] ordained for you to come to you must
[36:46] surrender to what he's brought you to
[36:50] my brother him says I was look if we
[36:53] quote just a minute I believe in quoting
[36:54] the Prophet he said now I was going to
[36:56] choke him but I'm going to say it he
[36:58] said man is omnipotent
[37:03] he said you don't believe that but he is
[37:07] thank God for a prophet that would not
[37:09] choke the vindication of God speak it
[37:12] out of him a
[37:14] man listen to say man fully surrender to
[37:18] God is
[37:19] omnipotent a man fully surrendered to
[37:24] God is
[37:26] omnipotent I
[37:28] [Applause]
[37:30] didn't say that the Prophet said that a
[37:34] man fully surrendered to God what is he
[37:39] surrendered to the flesh the flesh has
[37:41] got nothing to do with this he is
[37:43] surrendered to the scene that is only it
[37:46] oh come on church he is surrender to
[37:48] that see that God placed there that the
[37:51] word saw the word and came back to who
[37:54] it was
[37:56] I
[37:56] don't know about you but thanks be to
[37:59] God for the day that the word saw the
[38:02] word and I come back to who I was I
[38:08] was in sin but that was not my eternal
[38:12] destination I was bound in sin but that
[38:15] was not where God was going to leave me
[38:19] he was gonna send a message to
[38:23] strike something and call you out of it
[38:26] [Applause]
[38:30] he said did not he's saying mark 11:22
[38:34] what several things you saying don't
[38:35] doubt in your heart it'll come to pass
[38:38] did he not say that
[38:40] he said what happens when to omnipotence
[38:44] meet
[38:47] you want to see hang around a little bit
[38:50] longer
[38:51] what happens when two armed epithets
[38:55] meet
[38:58] when God and man comes together through
[39:03] omnipotence
[39:05] something's got to shake
[39:08] so the Prophet was saying that when a
[39:11] man so surrenders to God when a man
[39:14] pours out everything that he is to God
[39:17] he is surrendering to the Lord on the
[39:20] inside of him Oh glory he is
[39:23] surrendering to the word that is only
[39:25] inside of him and when that man meets
[39:28] God
[39:30] something's got to shake oh I heard
[39:34] really bad let me say last night on the
[39:35] way back the message the way back he
[39:37] said oh they was giving Jesus a hard
[39:39] time he said they were going around
[39:41] saying he's a man trying to be a God
[39:48] I
[39:49] felt no for the gym they've got that
[39:51] wrong he is a God trying to become a man
[39:56] to reach down and pick up men and bring
[40:00] them back to the position because the
[40:02] scripture said ye are as gods
[40:07] and
[40:08] the only thing the word brings forth is
[40:12] children of God
[40:14] the word don't bring forth natural the
[40:17] word brings forth supernatural
[40:20] [Applause]
[40:22] he said whatever you say with that
[40:24] creative power listen what God has
[40:27] placed in you with that creative power
[40:29] of omnipotence of God knowing that he's
[40:31] promised it and he said it in his word
[40:33] it creates a power that goes out younger
[40:37] and
[40:38] brings things to pass
[40:44] so when you speak the word when a son of
[40:48] God takes the word of God in his heart
[40:51] and places it upon his lips while that
[40:54] is the same as deity speaking oh
[40:59] glory that is the same as theity
[41:03] speaking
[41:05] he said it brings things to pass things
[41:07] that is not it makes them as though they
[41:11] are
[41:13] because to omnipotence have met I
[41:17] really met him talks like this he says
[41:19] because to omnipotence of men but first
[41:22] a man must be fully surrendered
[41:27] and I'll say this tonight we are either
[41:30] surrender to the devil or we are
[41:31] surrendered to God there's no in-between
[41:35] there's no purgatory in this thing
[41:36] you're either fully sold out to God or
[41:39] you're fully sold out to the devil
[41:41] there's no gray lines there's no more
[41:43] compromising this is seed time this is
[41:46] time for the sons and daughters of God
[41:48] to manifest what's on the inside of them
[41:52] [Applause]
[41:54] let me say this tonight either Satan has
[41:58] possessed or temple or goddess for
[42:00] sister temple either the devil is
[42:02] possessed your temple or the power of
[42:05] the resurrected Christ that's so
[42:07] possessed your temple you see people can
[42:10] sew straighter to the devil until he
[42:12] actually speaks through them
[42:15] or people can so sure in her to God
[42:18] until he speaks through it
[42:22] let me ask you tonight who's speaking
[42:25] out of you
[42:26] [Music]
[42:28] when we say things like I'll never make
[42:30] it that's not God well preach somebody
[42:34] when we say things like I'm a failure
[42:36] and because of my background because of
[42:39] my childhood and because of things I've
[42:41] been through I'll never obtain this
[42:43] promise that my friend is the devil
[42:45] speaking out of your lips but he's got
[42:49] no right to your lips tonight he's got
[42:53] no right to speak out of you there is a
[42:55] holy God that is desiring to possess
[42:58] your temple to where you start saying
[43:00] the same thing he says you say I can't
[43:03] make it but God rise up inside of you
[43:05] and say you are ready made it
[43:09] I
[43:10] can't take a rapture but the power of
[43:13] God raises up and says a rapture was
[43:16] made for you to make
[43:19] [Applause]
[43:24] people consider to God until he speaks
[43:26] to him look at the maniac of Ghaderi the
[43:30] Lord comes to him the Lord Jesus comes
[43:32] to me and says what's your name and
[43:35] those demons had supersets that man's
[43:37] temple that they spoke out of him and
[43:40] said we are legion for we are many
[43:47] look at the man that came to brother
[43:50] Branham says I'll break every bone in
[43:52] your body do you really think that man
[43:55] would have said that if the Holy Ghost
[43:58] was in there
[43:59] because the word can't fight the word
[44:03] that's why I got a problem with people
[44:05] saying they believe God sent a prophet
[44:07] but yet they're always fighting what the
[44:09] Prophet said
[44:10] either we believe what he said or we
[44:12] don't
[44:13] [Applause]
[44:16] well and I think we're you know we're
[44:19] counting the day in time we just need to
[44:20] kind of back up off the saying what
[44:22] brother I'm saying kind of back up off
[44:24] you know just preach something simple
[44:25] what are we thinking friends we're
[44:28] fixing to step into another dimension
[44:30] we're this close why do you think we're
[44:33] going to go back and start preaching
[44:34] dead denominational ideas that's got no
[44:37] power it's got no life in them listen to
[44:40] me they're not the only thing that's got
[44:42] life is this message the only thing
[44:44] that's got power is this message
[44:51] they will scare to death to say
[44:53] something brother branham said Oh
[44:56] glory to God they're scared to death to
[44:58] get us a brother branham said well they
[45:01] might think I'm a denomination they
[45:02] might think I'm a closer let them think
[45:04] I'm a closer I don't care I
[45:07] don't care listen to me I've seen
[45:10] funerals beat dentists 4 o'clock and
[45:12] watch a man of God get up and read a
[45:14] quote and say this is a quote that this
[45:17] man believed and watched the power of
[45:19] God break across an audience simply by
[45:21] the words of a prophet
[45:24] what could happen inside of living
[45:26] Tabernacles if we would so eat on those
[45:28] words and so possess those words into
[45:31] ourselves
[45:33] what could happen among us tonight
[45:36] [Applause]
[45:40] people get them quote politicians but
[45:42] they won't say brother Ram said
[45:44] I've heard preachers get up and quote
[45:46] aaand who was the alcohol and drinking
[45:48] preacher but let him say William Branham
[45:50] and they're scared to death I'm not
[45:52] scared to say the name William Branham I
[45:55] was proud of God to preach a message and
[45:58] it's a message of life and I'm gonna say
[46:00] when a prophet's already said and watch
[46:03] the power resurrection come behind those
[46:06] words and rip off the chains of
[46:08] captivity rip off the chains of homes
[46:10] what families come back together watch
[46:13] there'd be race what's all these things
[46:15] happen simply because we are manifesting
[46:18] what God has called us to
[46:20] don't be scared of it we're called to it

[46:27] equipped to carry this endtime word

[46:48] I'm not going backwards I'm going
[46:51] forward
[46:54] brother Ram didn't walk out there that
[46:56] day preach that message why Christ speak
[46:58] go back and preach it for Moses day and
[47:01] say Moses stood there and cried the
[47:03] whole time
[47:04] he never spoke he just stood there and
[47:07] cried what brother him said but him said
[47:10] he spoke what was there when you get a
[47:13] revelation of that title why cry speak
[47:17] why cry about these infirmities speak to
[47:21] him
[47:23] why cry about our fears speak to him
[47:28] why cry about our sicknesses start
[47:31] speaking them you've got a right to
[47:33] speak the word I
[47:38] say thanks be to God thanks be to God
[47:42] but we can speak something of life and
[47:45] then said I'll break every bone in your
[47:46] body but look at a man so possess the
[47:49] power of the Holy Ghost he looks at him
[47:51] and he says you'll fall across my feet
[47:56] so you got two vessels one is possessed
[47:59] of God and one is possessed of the devil
[48:02] and you got a meetin somewhere and one
[48:06] says you'll fall across my feet and the
[48:08] other and the other says I'll break
[48:10] every bone in your body but who's got
[48:12] Authority a
[48:15] downcast defeated devil or a son of God
[48:19] who's got Authority the devil or a son
[48:23] or daughter of God
[48:25] the devil is a liar can you say Amen he
[48:29] is the father of all lies he couldn't
[48:31] tell the truth if his life depended on
[48:33] it so I ain't gonna believe one thing
[48:35] he's got to say I'm gonna believe the
[48:38] promise of a resurrected Christ and that
[48:41] man fell across the prophets feet
[48:46] [Applause]
[48:48] and the police officer comes and says
[48:51] the rest says can you just move him off
[48:53] my feet the police officer says is the
[48:56] man delivered they said no he worships
[49:01] that spirit
[49:06] he worships that spirit
[49:10] think of that he worships
[49:14] that spirit
[49:18] but how does he worship
[49:24] does he contact that spirit and pull it
[49:27] out and bow to it and reverence it
[49:30] by speaking hooks by speaking things
[49:34] that that devil wants him to say he is
[49:37] actually giving worship to that devil he
[49:41] is actually surrendering to the devil by
[49:44] what he's saying
[49:47] god help us tonight friends when that
[49:50] Devil depressor to that demon of all
[49:52] kinds of things speaks out of us we are
[49:54] actually worshiping that spirit but I'm
[49:57] not called to worship a defeated devil I
[49:59] am called tonight to worship a
[50:02] resurrected Christ
[50:04] [Applause]
[50:07] remember says I was born in this world
[50:09] not by the will of man or not by man but
[50:11] by the will of God by design for the
[50:14] nation of God not by my holiness I have
[50:18] none
[50:19] but unnies saying I have no holiness I
[50:22] have no merits
[50:25] but are you gonna see
[50:29] I'm bout to shout I have got
[50:32] representation somewhere and it comes
[50:35] from another Kingdom
[50:36] its conduct from a different world
[50:43] brother Branham says you have to be born
[50:45] by the will of God to be saved
[50:51] he says the nominee the church age book
[50:54] he says denominations are coming
[50:56] together
[50:56] by the will of man
[51:01] so there's actually a wheel driving that
[51:04] spirit but it's not the will of God
[51:07] it's the will of a system it's the will
[51:10] of a man that is uniting denominations
[51:12] together well what you not in this bride
[51:15] together
[51:18] the will of some man or the will of God
[51:25] you see by the random says that every
[51:27] person is born on the earth with the
[51:29] wheel think of that but our will is not
[51:34] always his will
[51:38] but least I love this but we serve a God
[51:42] that is a personal God
[51:47] and he cares he's interested in you he's
[51:53] interested in the small things he's
[51:55] interested in the great things he's
[51:57] interested in things that might seem
[51:58] insignificant to others
[52:00] it matters it matters
[52:04] to God
[52:07] because he is a personal God
[52:12] [Applause]
[52:14] so things that you might be ashamed of
[52:17] all glory things you might be ashamed to
[52:20] say that somebody or to say pray for me
[52:22] or to say help me you might be ashamed
[52:24] of that but God is a personal God
[52:28] and he cares about the smallest things
[52:32] he cares about the big things he cares
[52:35] about all things
[52:38] [Applause]
[52:40] the good thing about our personal God is
[52:43] he is a sovereign God I love this and
[52:47] saw their names supreme ruler or
[52:51] possessing unlimited ultimate power
[53:00] remson Laodicean church in the church
[53:02] age Bicky says he is a southern god
[53:05] pretty Blaine he is a sovereign God and
[53:09] by his own counsel he purposed the plan
[53:13] of salvation of his own of his own elect
[53:17] which he foreknew
[53:20] the son died upon the cross to establish
[53:24] the means of salvation and the Holy
[53:26] Spirit I love this and the Holy Spirit
[53:29] carefully execute the will of the Father
[53:33] the
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:38] Holy Ghost
[53:40] carefully not haphazardly but carefully
[53:44] execute the will of the Father
[53:51] so I might come to church tonight I need
[53:53] healing brother Donnie might come the
[53:56] church not need encouragement for the
[53:57] West might leave victory
[53:59] so what does God do anoint one preacher
[54:02] for healing one preacher for for
[54:04] encouragement one preacher for victory
[54:07] the same preacher
[54:10] because there's a gift only inside of
[54:13] that vessel
[54:15] there is a gift on the inside that
[54:17] vessel that surrenders to the will of
[54:19] the Father Oh God don't you see why
[54:23] brother Adam said every preacher has
[54:24] gotta meet God on the backside the
[54:26] desert and get an experience with the
[54:27] Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is got
[54:30] to end well that surrendered vessel to
[54:32] carefully execute the will of the Father
[54:36] to carefully bring you what you need and
[54:39] bring you what you need it's the will to
[54:41] father that he bring these things to you
[54:45] [Applause]
[54:49] surrender surrender to what God I
[54:53] love that he carefully carefully execute
[54:56] the will of the Father he is working all
[54:59] things at this moment
[55:02] according to the purpose of his own will
[55:06] he
[55:10] is right in the midst of it all he is in
[55:13] the midst of his church this great
[55:15] creator Savior God is faithfully working
[55:18] amongst his own right now
[55:24] as the great Shepherd of the Sheep I
[55:31] love this his very existence is for his
[55:38] own
[55:40] the very reason he exists for the
[55:43] Charlie it's for you and for me
[55:46] [Applause]
[55:47] don't you let somebody bitching if the
[55:50] Holy Ghost it's some third person of
[55:52] some Godhead Trinity the Holy Ghost is
[55:55] the person
[55:57] indwelling our hearts feeling our souls
[56:01] changing our life healing our bodies
[56:03] raising the dead given the Holy Ghost
[56:06] casting out Devils bringing people to an
[56:09] experience the Holy Ghost is here for
[56:11] the very existence of this
[56:15] the very reason he exists is for the
[56:18] bride
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:22] foolery to God
[56:24] [Applause]

[59:37] God before the first funeral home he was
[59:39] God before the first psychologist well I

[59:48] pressure he'll be God when there is no
[59:50] more hospitals he'll be God when there

[1:00:23] God don't lie
[1:00:28] glory to God hallelujah
[1:00:31] he says how come in that with we lil
[1:00:34] insignificant man try to comprehend in
[1:00:35] our mind or let Satan
[1:00:38] deceive us
[1:00:40] by trying to make us doubt what you said
[1:00:44] is truth
[1:00:47] surely you keep your word they'll do its
[1:00:52] look and seek out diligently over to God
[1:00:57] throughout all the earth
[1:01:00] to find someone a lot of em said in the
[1:01:04] church age book that the message is not
[1:01:05] broadcast out because it's not for
[1:01:07] everybody come on friends it's for that
[1:01:10] elected
[1:01:12] go back and say the church age but
[1:01:15] brother Branham plainly lays it out the
[1:01:18] purpose of the message was election to
[1:01:21] come and get what belong to God why are
[1:01:25] you sitting here tonight because you
[1:01:27] belong to God
[1:01:30] why are we rejoicing because we belong
[1:01:33] to God
[1:01:36] you can show your glory through for
[1:01:39] you're so anxious to
[1:01:42] let people see the great God who made
[1:01:46] the promise keep the promise
[1:01:50] he's so anxious to find somebody that
[1:01:53] believes the promise but also believes
[1:01:56] he's able to keep the promise
[1:01:59] is there anybody among us tonight that
[1:02:03] believes he is able to keep his promise
[1:02:06] that's all he's looking for tonight it's
[1:02:09] somebody that believes God is more
[1:02:12] powerful to fulfill
[1:02:13] [Applause]
[1:02:16] why did brother Branham say in the
[1:02:18] message it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:02:20] righteousness because God is looking for
[1:02:22] somebody as he said and God keeps his
[1:02:24] word every scripture must be fulfilled
[1:02:27] so God is looking for somebody that says
[1:02:30] God made the promise but he's able to
[1:02:32] keep it
[1:02:35] thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord
[1:02:38] Jesus that he won't somebody that he can
[1:02:41] manifest that promise through
[1:02:48] you are sovereign he says even over
[1:02:52] unbelief your grace
[1:02:55] overrides our
[1:02:58] husbands
[1:03:00] glory to God your grace Lord overrides
[1:03:05] our I believe
[1:03:07] your grace
[1:03:09] overrides it
[1:03:13] don't you see why prophet could preach
[1:03:16] the message of grace
[1:03:19] because what overrode a prophet getting
[1:03:22] so depressed that he got down actually
[1:03:23] take a gun and kill himself grace oh
[1:03:26] how many times is God's grace overrode
[1:03:30] some of our decision well I'm gonna quit
[1:03:32] I'm not gonna go to church I don't know
[1:03:33] how many times is God grace we're
[1:03:36] overrode bad and brought you to the
[1:03:38] house of God and you there and the
[1:03:40] Shekinah glory begin to fall and the
[1:03:42] Holy Ghost forget to speak into your
[1:03:44] life and begin to speak in your heart
[1:03:46] and you begin to wave your hand he's
[1:03:49] beginning to clap your hands you begin
[1:03:51] to worship God what was it it was God's
[1:03:54] amazing grace Oh
[1:03:56] riding our unbelief
[1:03:58] [Applause]
[1:04:02] hallelujah my god it was great it was
[1:04:06] great to goddess it was grace that
[1:04:08] ballast and it'll be grace it'll keep us
[1:04:16] [Applause]
[1:04:18] thank you Jesus
[1:04:21] when God chose you he didn't take
[1:04:24] counsel from no one
[1:04:27] concerning you
[1:04:31] glory to God hallelujah
[1:04:40] that'll make a pista pillion shout and
[1:04:42] speak in tongues
[1:04:44] glory to God
[1:04:47] God didn't take counsel brother damn
[1:04:51] concerning from anybody concerning you
[1:04:53] when he chose you he didn't call
[1:04:56] everybody out of your past and say what
[1:04:58] do you think about brother so-and-so but
[1:05:00] God before there was a star before God
[1:05:03] there was four there was anything when
[1:05:04] it was God and God salts alone he placed
[1:05:07] a predestinated sheet of lies on the
[1:05:10] inside of your soul and he invested
[1:05:12] everything he's got inside of a bunch of
[1:05:15] sinners that had been saved by God's
[1:05:17] amazing grace
[1:05:17] [Applause]
[1:05:26] knowing knowing see the new birth is not
[1:05:30] a question for a son of God because he
[1:05:33] knows when he chose him they would come
[1:05:34] to a new birth
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:39] he knew exactly where you would be he
[1:05:42] knew exactly what you would do and he
[1:05:45] knew that you would surrender to the
[1:05:47] word inside of you so he called you
[1:05:49] knowing you had come home knowing you
[1:05:52] would come back to the word knowing
[1:05:54] these things would happen
[1:05:57] [Applause]
[1:06:00] what a terrible shape who would be here
[1:06:02] tonight if we was riding on our natural
[1:06:04] birth
[1:06:05] well I about to shout right now if we
[1:06:09] was riding on what our family used to be
[1:06:11] and on what our ancestors used to be I
[1:06:13] think be to God that every son and
[1:06:15] daughter of God can come to the altar
[1:06:17] the Lord Jesus Christ and find a real
[1:06:19] fresh experience we're not riding on
[1:06:22] something dead we're riding no life
[1:06:24] tonight we are riding on the new birds
[1:06:26] we are riding on an experience of the
[1:06:29] word of God coming in our hearts
[1:06:31] [Applause]
[1:06:35] he chose you not based on what you
[1:06:38] weren't oh I love this but on the
[1:06:39] potential I bought he placed inside
[1:06:44] with that
[1:06:45] revelation with that revelation we can
[1:06:50] shake the kingdom of Hale
[1:06:57] do you realize that not the theory
[1:07:00] motion not with your feelings not with
[1:07:02] sensation but with that revelation that
[1:07:05] God chose you
[1:07:09] brother Branham said you look at the
[1:07:11] woman at the whale he said before she
[1:07:13] got into predicaments she was in he said
[1:07:15] she no doubt she was raised in a good
[1:07:16] home she was raised in her faith believe
[1:07:18] at home but he said when she met a man
[1:07:20] by the name of Jesus it changed her life
[1:07:24] Oh
[1:07:25] glory to God he said it changed her life
[1:07:28] he said what happened he said from that
[1:07:30] time she could say I was a prostitute
[1:07:33] but now I am a blood washed daughter of
[1:07:36] the Living God well I don't know about
[1:07:38] you but thanks be to God for the day he
[1:07:40] overshadowed my soul thanks me for God
[1:07:43] the day he said the Holy Ghost looking
[1:07:45] for me he sought you out he sought me
[1:07:47] out and now you can say I used to be a
[1:07:50] drunk but now I'm a Holy Ghost drunk I
[1:07:52] used to be a liar but now I'll tell the
[1:07:55] truth
[1:07:56] [Applause]
[1:07:59] thanks be to God scepter on that time
[1:08:04] we're not the same we'll tell me we're
[1:08:07] not the same we are sons and daughters
[1:08:09] of God who have surrendered to him
[1:08:14] glory to God hallelujah
[1:08:17] [Applause]
[1:08:19] from that time from that time
[1:08:24] and from this time I gotta hurry because
[1:08:26] I'm running out down
[1:08:31] we see there is two wheels it's the will
[1:08:35] of man and the will of God
[1:08:38] we see there is the perfect wheel and we
[1:08:43] see there is the permissive wheel
[1:08:47] now let's just go ahead and face facts
[1:08:49] another enemy said your natural birth
[1:08:51] was brought here by the permissive will
[1:08:52] of God did he not say that
[1:08:54] so what's it going to take to override
[1:08:56] that permissive wheel and in grasped us
[1:09:00] and bring us back into
[1:09:04] reach myself happy hey man what's it
[1:09:08] gonna take to bring us out of that
[1:09:10] permissive wheel and bring us right back
[1:09:12] into the perfect wheel it's gonna take
[1:09:14] nothing less and nothing more than the
[1:09:16] overshadowing power the same Holy Ghost
[1:09:19] that overshadow the Virgin will marry
[1:09:21] and impregnated her as a spoken-word
[1:09:23] scene it's gonna take that same Holy
[1:09:25] Ghost to overshadow your soul and birth
[1:09:28] you out of your natural desire and birth
[1:09:30] me out of your natural habit and bring
[1:09:32] you back to the spiritual gene that he
[1:09:34] placed inside of you
[1:09:36] the old man must die the old man must
[1:09:41] die and the new man must be resurrected
[1:09:47] hallelu
[1:09:49] must be resurrected
[1:09:57] it's just in your nature
[1:10:00] it's a change of nature
[1:10:07] it's just as easy for sons and daughters
[1:10:10] of God the still most views and say amen
[1:10:12] to the message of the hour and say Amen
[1:10:14] - what brother Branham says that is it
[1:10:16] for a drunk not to get in his truck and
[1:10:17] turn on a country song
[1:10:18] it's just that easy
[1:10:22] we're not here fighting and pressing
[1:10:24] into something it's birthing us
[1:10:28] it's pushing us back to a fully
[1:10:32] surrendered vessel that God can come
[1:10:34] down and so possess that temple that you
[1:10:37] go to speak in the same word a prophet
[1:10:39] spoke and watch it happen
[1:10:42] [Applause]
[1:10:47] let me say this - not the will of God is
[1:10:50] not just a wish and the will of God's
[1:10:52] not a desire the will of God will be
[1:10:54] manifested and all hail can't stop it
[1:11:02] hell couldn't stop it back then how do
[1:11:05] you think hail is gonna stop it now
[1:11:06] he'll couldn't stop that seed from
[1:11:09] coming forth and bruised in the head of
[1:11:10] that serpent how do you think it's gonna
[1:11:12] stop it now there is something pulsating
[1:11:15] there is a laughing
[1:11:17] hallelujah there is a life on the inside
[1:11:19] of every son and daughter of God we're
[1:11:21] giving birth not two natural sons it's
[1:11:24] not too natural daughters there is a
[1:11:25] seed of God given birth to a heavenly
[1:11:27] son into a heavenly daughter and this
[1:11:30] same Holy Ghost for the Donnie one day
[1:11:31] it's gonna burst us right back in to the
[1:11:34] same place we came from
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:41] how could really madam say you came from
[1:11:43] God I
[1:11:51] just stepped out on faith I said they
[1:11:54] come from God how am I gonna tell
[1:11:56] they're gonna get back their nonsense
[1:11:58] nonsense a prophet come with a word of
[1:12:01] God to tell you come from God but he
[1:12:03] didn't just tell you you come from God
[1:12:04] he told you a way to get back to God
[1:12:06] [Applause]
[1:12:08] it's not by dr. Dobson it's not my
[1:12:11] smiley face in Texas it's by the word of
[1:12:14] a vindicated prophet they had to kill
[1:12:16] her a fire accompanied his ministry
[1:12:17] that's the only way that's the only way
[1:12:20] that's the only way that's the only way
[1:12:22] that's the only way you're gonna step
[1:12:25] back into eternity that's the only way
[1:12:27] you're gonna step out of time and step
[1:12:30] back into eternity the only way it's
[1:12:32] gonna happen is that a word of Malekith
[1:12:35] or no way else that's the only way

[1:13:09] will place you there with faith the same
[1:13:11] faith that father Abraham had it's the
[1:13:13] same face I'm gonna give you
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:17] and it's not you pushing it's the word
[1:13:20] drawing
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:25] it's the word drawing it's the word
[1:13:28] drawing I
[1:13:31] said I'm gonna tell them they come from
[1:13:33] God and then I'm gonna preach a message
[1:13:35] to get him back to God Oh
[1:13:38] God
[1:13:40] don't you see if something's ever
[1:13:42] birthed inside of you there ain't enough
[1:13:44] Devils inhaler talked you out of it
[1:13:49] you know how I know what my last name is
[1:13:52] I got it at birth I
[1:13:54] come from my father I come from my
[1:13:57] mother I'm identified by that name they
[1:13:59] give me at birth
[1:14:02] but brother Benton preached in 1965 the
[1:14:05] invisible union of Riley Lord Jesus
[1:14:06] Christ he said that old man must die Oh
[1:14:09] God you use Center to the name drunk
[1:14:12] let's say drunken you'd say here I come
[1:14:14] let's say liar here you'd come alive but
[1:14:16] now you'll answer those names anymore
[1:14:18] you know why because it's not a merit of
[1:14:20] your own it's not nothing we've done on
[1:14:22] our own it's been the grace of a
[1:14:23] sovereign God with unlimited power with
[1:14:26] all militants to speak in the hearts of
[1:14:28] people and say you will fulfill every
[1:14:31] scripture that's wrote about you
[1:14:34] it's just that ii
[1:14:37] [Applause]
[1:14:41] have a few more minutes now close REM
[1:14:43] says this is cheesy my brad the other is
[1:14:46] pregnant it by the word of god and will
[1:14:49] bring forth the body the finished body
[1:14:52] of Jesus Christ which is the bride
[1:15:03] where to go the body of Christ isn't
[1:15:06] finished yet
[1:15:10] so it's a work in progress
[1:15:15] you build a house you get done on the
[1:15:19] outside you ain't got nothing on the
[1:15:21] inside you move from the outside to the
[1:15:24] inside
[1:15:26] you move from the outside of the inside
[1:15:29] and people drive by that house and say
[1:15:31] there ain't nothing going on there
[1:15:32] what's happening I mean yeah there's a
[1:15:34] truck there but we don't see nobody
[1:15:35] working but what's happening the
[1:15:36] workings going on on the inside oh
[1:15:39] don't you see why I probably had to come
[1:15:42] and preach women out of high heels
[1:15:43] without a bob-tailed shirts and out of
[1:15:45] earrings and everything else and preach
[1:15:47] men out of 65 shorts don't you see why I
[1:15:50] profit had to do that because he had to
[1:15:52] get the outside right so the Holy Ghost
[1:15:54] on the inside could go to refinishing
[1:15:56] and go to finish in the inner man
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:00] he had to finish the inside the soul the
[1:16:05] real you it must be complete
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:11] it must be complete
[1:16:13] the inner man is renewed day by day by
[1:16:17] day
[1:16:27] for it again
[1:16:30] there's a man one time God told me at
[1:16:33] the paint store said this man come in he
[1:16:36] was a painter he said was painting the
[1:16:38] house it was worth over I think he was
[1:16:39] like over one or two million dollars
[1:16:42] he said I was in there painting inside
[1:16:45] somebody stuffed one day knocked on the
[1:16:48] door I was the door I said sir what you
[1:16:51] need he said I want to buy this house he
[1:16:53] said I don't own the house he said I'm
[1:16:54] just painted
[1:16:55] he said well who owns it he said I'll
[1:16:58] get you the number he said but sir he
[1:17:00] just bought this house he's not gonna
[1:17:03] sell this house
[1:17:04] man looked at him and said he'll sell it
[1:17:07] one way or the other he
[1:17:09] got that guy's phone number he called
[1:17:11] him he said how much you want for this
[1:17:12] house he sent some house I just bought
[1:17:14] it said leave that painter alone let him
[1:17:15] get done in there
[1:17:16] he come back two days later he said I
[1:17:19] want that house and I'm willing to do
[1:17:21] what I got to do to get that house he
[1:17:25] said call the man that owns it you're
[1:17:26] talking the wrong guy
[1:17:28] he looked at it the paint was chipping
[1:17:30] on the front it didn't have shutters
[1:17:32] he's in terrible condition but the owner
[1:17:34] knew the value okay he said I want the
[1:17:38] house the guy called the owner said so
[1:17:40] this is the last time I'm telling you I
[1:17:41] want to buy this house he said how much
[1:17:43] do you want for it he said I want two
[1:17:44] point five million he said I'll have my
[1:17:46] wife write the check
[1:17:47] he wanted the house
[1:17:50] nothing was going to stop him from
[1:17:52] getting that house because he wanted his
[1:17:55] family to move into that house and live
[1:17:57] inside that house don't you see why when
[1:17:59] the devil had you on the auction block
[1:18:01] of sin he said they're not for sale I'm
[1:18:03] not giving him out but cross it the only
[1:18:05] way I'm gonna break this cycle is by
[1:18:08] going to a cross and I'm because I won't
[1:18:10] that vessel I will me at all on my
[1:18:13] family my genes to move inside of there
[1:18:17] and display myself I
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:27] want that house when I buy that house it
[1:18:31] will be a fully surrendered house
[1:18:38] let me say this to you not closing
[1:18:41] in the garden we found the Lord Jesus
[1:18:45] down and he's praying
[1:18:48] he's praying
[1:18:51] what is he praying there was something
[1:18:54] inside of that Cup that passed by him -
[1:18:58] glory to God - look
[1:19:01] inside that Cup and say I want to do it
[1:19:06] for them but that flesh was still there
[1:19:09] don't you see what I'm saying is arising
[1:19:11] the son he said he had to die a man the
[1:19:14] spirit left him in the garden what was
[1:19:16] the Lord what was God trying to show you
[1:19:17] by birthing that son of God dispensation
[1:19:19] Jesus on the earth he was trying to
[1:19:21] prove that men can live and women can
[1:19:23] live for the Holy Ghost and whip the
[1:19:25] devil every day of their life
[1:19:27] by his example son
[1:19:32] so he ghosts the garden and he kneels
[1:19:35] down in the garden and as he kneels in
[1:19:37] the guard he begins to pray he sees
[1:19:39] something inside of this Cup that causes
[1:19:42] him to say father let this cup pass from
[1:19:48] me
[1:19:51] but there was something there had to be
[1:19:54] a means glory to God there had to be a
[1:19:56] means by which he could redeem his
[1:19:58] people
[1:19:59] so he Lucifer the contradiction of
[1:20:01] sinners he kneels in the garden he
[1:20:03] begins to pray and he sees something in
[1:20:05] this cup then as he's praying it calls
[1:20:08] him to say
[1:20:09] father
[1:20:11] father
[1:20:12] let this cup pass from me
[1:20:17] and he's praying so hard it was not a
[1:20:19] little prayer but let's get down and
[1:20:21] pray god bless mommy god bless daddy God
[1:20:22] but it was not a prayer life bad he
[1:20:24] actually got in and begin to pray till
[1:20:26] he begin to sweat and as he begin to
[1:20:29] pray the sweat begin to drop from his
[1:20:31] brow
[1:20:32] and the capillaries begin to bust and he
[1:20:36] begin to pray to actually great drops of
[1:20:39] blood begin to fall the Puffin of God
[1:20:41] said it all hail had lined up around the
[1:20:43] labor there was a it's the Battle of the
[1:20:45] mind going back and forth that's what
[1:20:46] we're in right now the greatest battle
[1:20:48] ever fought is the battle of the mind
[1:20:51] and here he is the spirit left him in
[1:20:54] the garden so he's brand he's gonna die
[1:20:55] as a man and as his prayer in the Benham
[1:20:59] since all past sins all present sins and
[1:21:02] all future sins rested upon this man's
[1:21:08] decision
[1:21:10] and as you begin to pray he began to
[1:21:13] pray so earnestly and all hell will
[1:21:15] stand there waiting to hear a few words
[1:21:17] that would change the destiny of souls
[1:21:20] forever
[1:21:21] glory it would change the destiny of
[1:21:25] souls forever
[1:21:26] he begin to pray and as these words come
[1:21:30] across his mouth I could imagine hail
[1:21:32] just just fell apart
[1:21:34] why he was a son the example son he was
[1:21:39] a surrendered vessel to what the word
[1:21:41] the father he said I can do nothing left
[1:21:43] the father shows me first
[1:21:45] and he surrenders by saying
[1:21:48] father
[1:21:50] not my will
[1:21:52] but thy will be done
[1:21:56] and brother Branham says this
[1:22:00] he says and Jesus was here can friend he
[1:22:02] said now God did not spare his own son
[1:22:04] from this cruel testing that he will not
[1:22:06] spare you or I from the cruel testing
[1:22:09] and Jesus was here confronting the
[1:22:11] greatest test he ever had Gethsemane lay
[1:22:12] just before him where that once and
[1:22:14] final all-sufficient test must come when
[1:22:16] the burdens of the entire world
[1:22:19] laid upon his blessed shoulders there
[1:22:23] was no one in all heavens the earth
[1:22:25] could ever stood it but him
[1:22:27] and to know that all the sins of past
[1:22:30] sins in president sensing future sins
[1:22:31] rested up on this decision and listed
[1:22:34] this not what he was walking on water
[1:22:36] not when he was turning Brenner or not
[1:22:38] when he was taking a feeding 5,000 or
[1:22:40] turning water into wine no his greatest
[1:22:42] test his greatest victory of his
[1:22:45] Messiahship was what yielding to the
[1:22:47] word yielding to that word oh
[1:22:49] god what's the greatest thing is for us
[1:22:52] is to deny our flesh deny our self deny
[1:22:55] his eyes and say god I come to you and I
[1:22:59] surrender all that I am I surrender all
[1:23:02] that I am to you
[1:23:08] and it was one of the most greatest
[1:23:10] victories that Christ ever won or
[1:23:13] approved his great Messiahship that's
[1:23:17] when he said to God not my will
[1:23:24] but thy will be done
[1:23:28] that was the greatest victory he ever
[1:23:32] won is when he fully
[1:23:36] surrendered
[1:23:40] and close did I say this tonight the
[1:23:43] brothers just saying father if thou be
[1:23:44] willing remove this cup from me
[1:23:45] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:23:47] done what does that word will mean it
[1:23:49] means desire it means pleasure what one
[1:23:53] wishes or has determined shall be done
[1:23:54] used to the purpose of God the Blessed
[1:23:56] man comes through Christ of what God
[1:23:58] wishes to be done by us commands
[1:24:00] precepts real choice inclination desire
[1:24:06] once you see why God placed that seat
[1:24:10] inside of you because he knew he knew he
[1:24:14] knew that that seed would break forth
[1:24:16] let me say this tonight we will not go
[1:24:20] on a rapture and the seat of God be
[1:24:22] subject to our own sorry stinking rotten
[1:24:23] flesh we will go in a rapture and our
[1:24:26] flesh will be subject to the word that
[1:24:28] was placed inside of us before the
[1:24:31] foundation of the world and the greatest
[1:24:33] victory you ever had I'm sorry it's not
[1:24:35] when you might have went and done
[1:24:36] something greater the greatest victory
[1:24:38] you ever had is when you come and said
[1:24:40] Lord I surrender
[1:24:42] to the pool I
[1:24:44] surrender to what's pulling me how many
[1:24:48] people is God passed by their way and
[1:24:50] with the turgon and with the pullin but
[1:24:52] because it was not easy because it was
[1:24:54] not something simple they pushed it away
[1:24:57] but you sit here tonight
[1:24:59] not by nothing we've done but because
[1:25:02] the word seen the word and the word
[1:25:06] started dry
[1:25:08] as the musicians are coming tonight the
[1:25:11] word the word started drawing
[1:25:16] the rim told that story he said I was
[1:25:18] out there he said that little that
[1:25:20] little
[1:25:22] drop of water it begin to smile it began
[1:25:25] to have a revival he said I asked is it
[1:25:28] because I drink from his ecause I do
[1:25:29] this he said no if it could only speak
[1:25:32] little bit saying because I'm going back
[1:25:34] to where I come from
[1:25:36] something was pulling him it was not him
[1:25:39] pushing himself up it was something
[1:25:41] pulling all God friends do you not see
[1:25:43] tonight why it wasn't some music it
[1:25:45] wasn't some gift or some talent that
[1:25:47] really got ahold of you it was the word
[1:25:49] connecting back to the word and started
[1:25:51] pulling oh I'm gonna start there in the
[1:25:53] first church day and he's pulled seed
[1:25:55] all the way through seven church ages
[1:25:56] until now he's got to this last Church
[1:25:58] days and you sitting on those pews
[1:26:01] tonight are the final voice to the final
[1:26:04] generation you are the culmination of
[1:26:06] what seven church ages have been it's
[1:26:08] ride time now it's ride time now it's
[1:26:13] time to go home it's time to go home the
[1:26:17] world is falling apart and it's time to
[1:26:20] go back
[1:26:22] to where you come from
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:34] you see what it's time to do is for
[1:26:38] Eagles to spread their wings
[1:26:41] the rest of that Eagle can go a long
[1:26:43] time before he recognizes what he is
[1:26:51] he says when you surrender fully he'll
[1:26:53] come in fully but until you surrender
[1:26:55] fully he can't come in fully
[1:27:01] it's like the lady that had that dream
[1:27:03] that time she died and then her dream
[1:27:05] she died and went to heaven and she
[1:27:06] stood before the Lord and she said Lord
[1:27:07] why why on earth why was the only thing
[1:27:10] that you used of my of me was my hands
[1:27:12] why my hands to cook my hands to help
[1:27:16] people why was that the only part you
[1:27:17] used them and he said because that was
[1:27:19] all you surrendered to me
[1:27:22] and think about it tonight God wants all
[1:27:26] of us
[1:27:27] our mind our ears our eyes our lips
[1:27:32] everything we are he wants us all to
[1:27:35] surrender fully to his will he said
[1:27:41] surrender think of this
[1:27:43] surrender surrender your thoughts
[1:27:47] surrender your thinking
[1:27:50] why do people fight against us all the
[1:27:53] time why they fight against lubbers why
[1:27:55] they fight against us because they
[1:27:56] refused to surrender do what the word
[1:27:58] said whether profit breach but I'm
[1:27:59] asking you tonight in the name of the
[1:28:01] Lord surrender
[1:28:04] surrender I
[1:28:06] told somebody the day I said I study
[1:28:08] awhile and repent a whole lot
[1:28:12] well I thought it was this way but
[1:28:14] you're a prophet of God say this and you
[1:28:15] say Lord I'm wrong I'm sorry it's that
[1:28:17] way
[1:28:18] but the hardest thing for many people to
[1:28:21] say is I was wrong and brother branham
[1:28:22] taught it right
[1:28:24] I
[1:28:27] was wrong on my the other 70 I was
[1:28:30] rolling all these things and because of
[1:28:31] that people get complexes and they birth
[1:28:33] Wars out of their life fighting against
[1:28:35] that because they refused to surrender
[1:28:37] to what a prophet already said what's
[1:28:40] the only way we're going to get victory
[1:28:41] in this age is to surrender to what the
[1:28:43] word said the surrender to what brother
[1:28:45] Branham said because he could tell us
[1:28:47] the way back Oh hallelujah he could tell
[1:28:51] us the way back
[1:28:55] if I've never been to town I'm not gonna
[1:28:57] try to go on my own I'm gonna ask
[1:28:58] somebody that's been there
[1:29:00] and God sort of props for how we come
[1:29:03] and how we got back and then he come and
[1:29:06] said this is how you're gonna get back
[1:29:08] surrender surrender your life surrender
[1:29:12] your all
[1:29:13] surrender listen this surrender your
[1:29:16] prestige
[1:29:18] think of that
[1:29:20] surrender everything to him now and
[1:29:23] he'll come in and fill you with the Holy
[1:29:26] Ghost
[1:29:27] that's what he's here to do I love this
[1:29:30] he's praying since he's already struck
[1:29:32] two or three here in the building
[1:29:33] there's more right there he said warning
[1:29:35] the Holy Ghost just keep believing glory
[1:29:37] to God either right or wrong he says
[1:29:39] humbly your own thinking
[1:29:41] humble your own thinking humble your own
[1:29:46] thinking why did God bypass scholars and
[1:29:50] bishops and reveal it to three wise men
[1:29:52] because they surrendered their thinking
[1:29:56] humble your own thinking humble your own
[1:30:01] ways
[1:30:05] you see God
[1:30:08] sends no one away empty
[1:30:10] except those who come for themselves
[1:30:18] God since not a one of us away empty
[1:30:21] unless we come full of ourselves and not
[1:30:26] willing to say get self out of the way I
[1:30:31] don't care about my this I don't care
[1:30:34] let me ask you this people say oh I
[1:30:36] can't go back on something I can't I
[1:30:38] can't say I was wrong a prophet of God
[1:30:41] said I was wrong

[1:30:44] prophet stood and cried I was wrong I
[1:30:48] almost made the greatest mistake of my
[1:30:50] ministry I almost made the Antichrist
[1:30:52] Christ again I
[1:30:55] was wrong
[1:30:58] if a prophet can say that I can scream
[1:31:01] the top of my voice I'm wrong I'm wrong
[1:31:05] I want to be burst into the heavenly
[1:31:08] kingdom I don't care about my reputation
[1:31:10] I don't care about some ministry I don't
[1:31:13] care about who's the greatest among us I
[1:31:15] care about a rapture I care about
[1:31:17] getting out of here I'm willing to come
[1:31:19] and say I was wrong

[1:32:25] sent by God with the pillar of fire to
[1:32:29] show light unto this door caged and
[1:32:30] revealed to us not only that we were
[1:32:32] wrong but that he was wrong and he went

[1:48:18] Teresa wives we've been to the doctor

[1:48:25] tests but she just believed in the Lord
[1:48:27] they got a move for I suppose and ER if
[1:48:30] he had wear this handkerchief tonight he
[1:48:33] was anointed to preach I just couldn't
[1:48:34] keep from thinking about so many
[1:48:36] different things that was said so I want
[1:48:38] you to join with me right now we're
[1:48:39] going to pray that God will just
[1:48:41] move for our sister Heavenly Father you
[1:48:44] see this
[1:48:46] gross whatever it is and sister Teresa
[1:48:50] White's body
[1:48:51] father we're looking not to just doctors
[1:48:55] reports but we're looking to your report
[1:48:57] and not in your word
[1:48:59] Lord is your word is gone forth
[1:49:02] heavenly father another son of God stood
[1:49:05] here anointed by the Holy Ghost to bring
[1:49:07] the word of deliverance I pray Lord that
[1:49:10] you were just so annoying our sisters
[1:49:12] faith may there be no evil outcome of
[1:49:15] his Lord but may it be another
[1:49:17] opportunity about which the Spirit of
[1:49:20] God can be able to bring deliverance one
[1:49:23] more time and the lives of your children
[1:49:25] Lord we don't pray repetitively over
[1:49:29] these things and asked over and over
[1:49:31] again because you didn't hear it's the
[1:49:33] first time but we believe the words of
[1:49:36] God come through our lips so we're
[1:49:39] taking that sword and just keep
[1:49:41] hammering at the devil is it Lord not
[1:49:43] because if we pray 500 times you'll hear
[1:49:46] us but we believe if we pray in faith
[1:49:48] you hear it's the first time but we just
[1:49:51] keep asking and believing and thanking
[1:49:53] you for it knowing that you're mindful
[1:49:55] Lord God we believe you in Jesus

[1:50:06] the morning that year and that's and I
[1:50:07] polls things bless your little o hearts
[1:50:09] hey man let's just come back expecting
[1:50:12] the Lord to speak to us again by his
[1:50:13] word he's so mindful of a Sydney a man
[1:50:17] your loving with all your heart you've
[1:50:18] been ministered to tonight by the hand
[1:50:20] of God the grace of the Lord you believe
[1:50:22] the mouth of the Lord is actually spoken
[1:50:24] to us tonight what a privilege said
[1:50:27] under the word of
[1:50:29] Hey
[1:50:33] praise the Lord another lot of folks
[1:50:36] sick a lot of different things that are
[1:50:37] going on and sister Betty Walter I guess
[1:50:40] her situation is probably about the same
[1:50:42] maybe getting a little bit lower each
[1:50:44] each our blood pressure heart rate this
[1:50:47] then the other but you know if God's not
[1:50:50] done with her life she could be laying
[1:50:51] there and absolutely no life at all in
[1:50:53] our body but if God's not done the devil
[1:50:55] ain't won't take her but if the Lord is
[1:50:58] finished with her then certainly would
[1:50:59] want to keep her here and certainly in
[1:51:01] the condition that she's in but let's
[1:51:03] just pray for her and pray for the
[1:51:04] family that God would be with them and
[1:51:06] and strengthen them as well it's going
[1:51:08] to face each one of us we're gonna go
[1:51:10] but that open door of death or we're
[1:51:12] gonna meet it in the rapture whichever
[1:51:14] it is for the will of God for our lives
[1:51:15] is exactly what he wants here brother
[1:51:18] BAM say it and I heard it for years and
[1:51:20] years ago was the first time it just
[1:51:21] really amazed me he said whenever God is
[1:51:24] finished with me in life I'm finished
[1:51:26] with life so I thought well I guess
[1:51:29] that's the way it is our purpose is done
[1:51:31] we've completed it we've fulfilled it
[1:51:33] and then we're going to that place it's
[1:51:35] waiting for us but let's just pray for
[1:51:37] the family and God will be with Simmons
[1:51:38] strengthen them god bless you saying
[1:51:40] sorry and shake hands until I tell them
[1:51:41] it's been good to be in the house of the
[1:51:43] Lord
