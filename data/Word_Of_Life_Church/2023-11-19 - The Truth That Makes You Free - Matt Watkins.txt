worshiping and praising the Lord and in that atmosphere I believe there's special things can take place amen praise the lord well we greet you amen this morning and just want to say again how much of a privilege it is is to be here and I uh mean it when I say I really uh consider myself just the least amongst anybody to be able to stand and minister to you and to preach to the young people but I just pray that the Lord was able to use something that I said that the Holy Spirit spoke to you and in some way God could have encouraged you or spoken or answered a question amen I believe lives were changed we ought to give praise for that say God thank you for sending the word that changes lives hallelujah amen like to say to all my family that's here all my kids that are here and my wife and

say how much we love you uh how much we appreciate you and how much uh we're praying for you Amen brother Lance and all of the family you mean a great deal to us if I could just say that just for a moment I told brother Donnie this already but I just want to say it here I don't think brother Donnie would even be aware of how much let me just say this this way I don't think you realize how much just the fact that brother Donnie's here his family's here sister Carol's here the fact that they're still standing he's still preaching he's still pressing I don't need any more proof that there's a God who lives Hallelujah you ought to support him amen with your prayers amen they need it right now so we just want to say how much we love them how much brother Donnie's Ministry is meant to us and and uh just consider him to be one of the greatest men that's ever lived and I say that unashamedly amen I really mean that from the bottom of my heart as testimony amen unwavering his balance in the word uh has just meant a great deal and I know how much you love and appreciate him amen this morning and and I know that there's Believers around the world that would Echo that with an amen so we love this church we love what uh you're doing for the young people it's helped ours amen uh our children come here to these meetings and they're blessed by it all the young people would say how many young people would say thank you to or to life for having a meeting like this that I could come to why don't we give him a hand this this morning amen amen we're blessed by it amen greatly blessed by it well we want to turn to the word now and I want you to turn to Joshua chapter 4 we're going to read from two places Joshua chapter 4 and also we're going to turn to the Book of John chapter 16 and I just want to minister to you and just maybe cap off I still got uh just I'm preaching here I'm going to preach to the whole church but I just got something still amen for the Youth and this is being a youth weekend amen that would be for I believe it would be a word for everybody body Joshua chapter 4 and we're just going to be begin reading here at the first verse and then we'll turn to John 16 I'm going to preach to you today just something that I've ministered only in a couple places just what the Lord's burdened we me with recently and um and I'm just uh got uh just a lot on my heart so I don't exactly have an outline uh which way I'm going and exactly all laid out but you pull on the word and God will do the directing amen I want to title this today truth that sets you free and I want to subtitle this taking a stand for truth and it came to pass when all the people were clean pasted over Jordan that the Lord spake unto Joshua saying take you 12 men out of the people out of every tribe of man and command you them saying take you hence out of the midst of Jordan out of the place now this is going to be important not just anywhere not just any stone they're going to Cross Jordan but God actually is going to do something and he says I want you to take go go into the Jordan he says out of the place where the priest feet stood firm so not just generically not just any gospel not just any not just any thought or any Doctrine or any idea but where these original priests were going to place their feet they were going to put their feet firmly in the Jordan and God says I want you to go and take those stones out of the exact place place where his left foot was his right foot was what they stood upon water baptism in Jesus name not three Gods Not three persons but one person revealed serpent seed it wasn't an apple in the beginning it was adultery these were the truths that the prophet of God said would turn your heart back to the faith of the fathers and he says out of the place where the priest feet stood firm 12 Stones and you shall carry them over with you leave them in the lodging place where you shall let Lodge this night let's go on further Joshua calls 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe a man all of the CH Levi G uh uh Gad Ruben all of them there was a man representing the entire body of God Joshua said pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God in the midst of Jordan take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder verse 6 now here's important that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come aha so what God was actually doing wasn't necessarily for this generation but he knew this generation would turn away fall away but there was coming a generation of children that would start say what do these Stones mean and notice he wasn't going to leave it upon a testimony of a dad or a grandpa or hunt story or fishing story he was going to leave them the word the Revelation the stone and it would turn their hearts back Hallelujah and he says that this may be a sign he says that then you shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever why don't we just bow our our heads now and pray if you have something upon your heart just raise it before the Lord say God come and use brother Matt use the vessel you sent Lord to minister to my heart Jesus Jesus I raise my hand Lord God and ask for a special touch this morning I pray God you just move me out of the way Lord may I just be a weapon in your hands God to tear the lies of the devil down in your family I pray God make me a tool in your toolbox that I could be used for your glory god we'll give you all the praise and the honor and the glory in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated than you brother yes it's good thank it's an amazing age that we live in and I'm just going to go filling the holy spirit this morning but it's a chaotic world I think any of us could identify and say that we understand that very clearly I want you to understand that the world that you live in is being controlled by a spirit that the things that are happening today in the world that you live in it's no accident that the things that are taking place are taking place there's nothing random actually that happens in time because time is not randomly occurring actually history is really his story and so it's his events in fact everything that's happened from the beginning of time God's already pre-planned it he's already mapped it out he's already charted it out and so everything that's happening in our world today is actually being controlled not by the White House not by the Kremlin not even by the Vatican but actually what's controlling the entire world today is this book and it's not a book of History it's no it has history in it it's not a book of just ideas or doctrines or theories it's actually a living organism that is controlling the entire world and it doesn't just speak to the family of God it also speaks to the world it speaks to the Antichrist speaks to the Beast system it speaks to all of the nations of the world both both Jew and Gentile and the world events that you're seeing transpire today you wouldn't be able to make sense out of them other than that that there's a prophecy controlling the hearts of men how else would you make sense upon an entire world that is turning their back on a little bitty nation in in in in the Middle East and that the anti-Semitism friends if you just read the news here today the anti-Semitism that is so infiltrating the the the uh people that you would have never thought listen you may think well the world stands for Israel the United States stands for Israel let me just go ahead and preach to you and say uh they start out as a lamb but one day they'll speak as a dragon and this same nation that so reveres in Judean Christian values and and they you know they love the Lord And they support Israel the same Nation will turn its back on that little land of Israel because it's being controlled by prophecy and the Bible says in the book of Zechariah 12 and through chapter 14 that actually all all the nations of the world will come against Israel I stood there and I couldn't believe it here just in August of this year we were just there for 15 days my first time ever getting to go there to to to Israel and I stood there on T megiddo the the the the the the mountain there t megiddo tell meaning Hill in in in Hebrew and and and it was incredible to look at this great vast uh Valley that I seen now here I'm standing at the uh where the valley of Armageddon is and I it was so surreal there for a moment just looking over this massive uh Outlook where you can just see all the mountains on the left side and you have Mount Carmel over here and all of the mountains that you read about right in the Bible and then in the middle of all of that is this Great Valley of Armageddon megiddo and I thought it's amazing I was telling me and brother Travis and I said it's incredible when you just look and and look out here that do you realize that the battle that that will take place when all of the armies of the Earth the Bible prophesies this all of the nations in fact it will be a a United Nation Army all of the Nations the Bible says will Encompass Jerusalem round about to destroy it and the and the scripture brother Brandon would say it this way all of those Nations will come in that Valley of Armageddon and they don't realize the reason that God has gathered them against Israel as he wanted them in one place to pour out his wrath upon them and I thought it's incredible to me because the world doesn't realize that the spirit that they're under is a rhythm it's a certain beat and it sounds good you know people's rights and you got to be fair to everybody and there's injustices taking place and and and and you got to be fair and it's got to be both sides they don't realize that that same political speech and that same idea that sounds so reasonable to the Ral mind is the very spirit that will lead them to the valley of Armageddon one day and brother Bram said that that battle that takes place in Zechariah 12 where all the nations Encompass Jerusalem brother bham said that great battle will just be the final battle of the war that started in the Garden of Eden and it's the final battle that will take place listen friends the things that are taking place today or being controlled by prophecy I don't want to get into it today as we don't not really our message or have time to do that but do you realize that actually that the world brother Brandon would say would have to get into the spirit of destruction before God can pour out his wrath upon them that before God could ever destroy the world the people would first have to get in the spirit and act actually brother brandham would show how that the six seal was a tribulation seal but the prophet of God said that even that six seal Jesus spoke of it in fact he points all the way back to Pharaoh when he when there when the children of Israel were were enslaved in in in in Egypt and brother bam said he was under a sick seal he was under a pre-tribulation anointing so we understand by prophecy that when the seals were broke though we know that the six seal is a tribulation brother Matt does that mean that we're in the tribulation period no it's not in time where that hasn't actually taken place but what we understand is that the the breaking forth of that six seal there was actually an anointing that those Chargers that were loosed at the river Euphrates that would come ecclesiastically and religiously and politically in fact brother brandham said that six seal pre-tribulation anointing fell Upon A Man Named ikan Hitler Stalin musolini come on friends are you Believers today and he said that they were under a plague or a sick seal anointing that was released upon them to destroy the Jews and they don't realize man doesn't realize listen friends the Bible you're you're living in prophetic times I hope you understand the magnitude of the moment that you're living in in time that the world is going completely out of their minds they don't know what a man is they don't know a woman is you think that's an accident that's real friends that's Bible prophecy and they don't realize they're under a pre-tribulation anointing getting into the spirit of destruction to destroy God's family and they don't realize it's corrupting their schools it's corrupting our our politics I don't care if you're left I don't care if you're right I don't care if you're libertarian I don't care if you're in the White House listen friends it ain't going to take another Donald Trump or another George Washington brother vom says you can put them all on every street corner and the world would still go to hell because it's already been condemned and prophesied oh brother bandam said I prophesy to you in the name of the Lord the world will go completely insane and they don't realize that that sick seal has literally anointed their heart for destruction oh but I got a word for the bride of Christ if a sick seal could anoint the hearts of people for Destruction how much more would a seventh seal under a seven the messenger I'll put us under the spirit of a body change do you realize that's the spirit that you're feeling today it's an anointing to take us out of this world one [Applause] day and they're literally under the spell or the delusion of a bewitching spirit it's got a rhythm I'm just going to get to dear to my notes it's got a rhythm it's being influenced by Spirits uh the world is such a place where Paul would say who hath Bewitched you let me just say this friends the darker the world gets the more unpopular the truth will become now I'm not talking about a version of truth that's preached in mega churches and and denominal chal churches God loves you God does love you he wants the best for you he does want the best for you oh God doesn't care how you live God doesn't care listen all it is is about accepting Jesus and you realize what they've done is they they've just taken scissors and they cut out the parts that they don't like and they've emphasized the parts that they do like and then they'll use that to argue against you well you're what are you saying Calvary wasn't enough absolutely I believe Calvary was enough but Calvary was just the beginning you see that Calvary cross was just the beginning let me give you the words of the Bible behold he's not there he's risen he's not in the Tomb anymore he's in your heart that was just the beginning of the story thank you Lord but it would get to such a place where the truth will become more and more and more unpopular let me say it this way the message of the hour to really live the true message of the hour will become more unpopular the darker the world gets it's amazing to me the gospel that Paul preached got his head chopped off the gospel that Jesus preached got him crucified the gospel Peter preached got him hung upside down but somehow the gospel that's being preached today fills up with 20,000 people it's amazing to me the same gospel that was rejected to where the Apostle Paul would say I I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's the power listen friends there was a reason Paul would have to say I am not ashamed of this gospel and I believe it's going to get to the place to where the believer will have to say I'm not ashamed of the message of the hour I'm not ashamed that God sent a prophet I'm not ashamed to say it was the voice of God to me personally but Satan is an intimidating spirit and he backs us up into Corners we got into a place to where we can't preach the uh people people don't want the truth anymore they want their version of the truth all right in fact it would be that was that was just as religious as Abel was in fact contining for the faith brother bandham actually said Cain was more religious than Abel was in fact brother Brandon would say he did more good works than Abel did my goodness so it would be a spirit that would bewitch the church John 16 listen to this this is uh very familiar scripture I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth not some of the truth not part of the truth not one version of the truth but all of the truth right he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he won't glorify me he he shall glorify me for he shall not receive of mine and and shall show it to you uh so brother bandham said that this is why the seals had to be opened because Christ had had more that he wanted to say is that right and so we know that brother Brandon would make it very simple and he would say actually there's only two spirits that you can be influenced by and that's so simple either a spirit from above or a spirit from beneath man is only ever controlled by one or two things right and Jesus would say if you love the world or the things of the world now if you look at that word world it's actually the word CA Cosmos and it's the structure it's the opposite of the word chaos chaos meaning disorder Cosmos meaning structure or system or order this is what the world is being led by a structure a a a a system a a certain order that they're being marched by and it's they don't realize that their agenda is actually a satanic agenda though very religious remember brother Brandon said what did what did he want he wanted to be worshiped he wanted a church he wanted a pull pit and I'm here to say he's accomplished his his purpose and so so he's they don't know even what a man is brother brandom says Dear God I pray you'll manifest yourself tonight this is an events made clear I don't have this uh that you will manifest yourself tonight on Hebrews 13:8 that you're the same yesterday today and forever and the works that you did then you'll do today we brother Adam says notice you look at these boys they look so much like girls wearing clothes like them and see the girls trying to act so much like boys see the women and men in this perverted age see sex appeal has became an idol of worship the gospel has been pushed out to one side and nakedness of the lady aan Church oh God what an answer notice this is what this is the age where men doesn't know what a man is and you'll watch a man go to one extreme or the other he'll either be a chauvinist who doesn't really know his position and he's on a power trip of authority and he beats that woman down like a like a doormat listen God never made her to be a doormat I'm going to preach God never made her to be a doormat he didn't take from Eve from the bone of his foot prophet of God would say and make a doormat neither did he take from the bone of his head to make him a head over him but in her proper place in her proper position in her proper order in the man's proper order in the proper place according to the word of God it'll produce the it'll produce the Life of Christ it'll produce that's what's pleasing to Christ but you notice what happens is that man doesn't know what man is woman doesn't you think it's an accident the transgender and lgbtq uh agenda is happening right now friends it's a fulfillment of Prophecy to where men don't know what a man is doesn't know what he'll either be a or he'll be a little that never takes a stand for anything it's just a pushover all right [Music] Lord do you know that we had a prophet in this generation and it was a prophecy he was a Watchman on the wall do you know what the Bible read the Bible uh h h definition of a Watchman was he was to sit on the wall and he was to warn the city of oncoming judgment or of an oncoming enemy and I'm so glad today we had a prophet who was a faithful Watchman who identified the enemy long before he ever got there but do you know what the gift of the true Watchman was anybody could identify the enemy when he had his ladders uh putting his putting his you know battering ram up oh hey guys hey trouble trouble uh they got their battering rams everybody prepared for war you see any preacher could do that anybody can ident identify fruit but it takes a prophetic eyesight to identify seeds you say well that's not in the message we don't have listen friends you have everything in Fruit form today the prophet of God identifed identified in seed form in the message of the hour why do you think he would preach against I Love Lucy and you'd say well what is so har what's so wrong with I Love Lucy I mean it just seems so harmless today seems like oh look at look at what but do you realize that the seed of I Love Lucy is the fruit of what Hollywood puts out today and a faithful Watchman said kick that thing out of your house don't consume it don't watch it don't partake of it because the seed was a seed of rebellion and a seed of head anti- headship that is now manifesting in Hollywood today but you see a prophet has prophetic insight and he wasn't going to identify the Watchman wasn't going to wait for the enemy to be on the wall the Watchman was going to be able to see a long ways off and say Hey you know that thing that looks so minuscule and so small out there doesn't seem like much it's out there now but when it gets here it'll bring destruction and so brother Brandon would identify the seeds the seeds of of of of Nica to ISM he would he would we're not going to go into that today but listen what the Bible says it says in Romans chapter 8 the carnal mind for to be Carn minded 8 verse 5 is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind you say brother Matt what is my carnal mind this one oh I've been born again this one but I'm filled with the Holy Ghost this one you see your intellectuals will never agree with the word of God in fact it won't make much sense to your intellectual brain and if you lead towards your intellect come on friends to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God nor indeed can be so then those who are in the flesh cannot please God brother Bon would say it this way the wisdom of man can ACC to accumulate and to prove and to show these things why man should do this is contrary enmity the carnal mind enmity with the word of God you'll never rationalize it out you'll never make it I'm going to give you the words of Spurgeon I love this Paul didn't say that the carnal mind was at enmity with God he put it even stronger than that the carnal mind is enmity it is not black but Blackness it is not at enmity but actually enmity itself it is not corrupt but corruption it is not rebellious it is rebellion it is not Wicked it is wickedness itself the heart though it be deceitful is positively deceit it is evil in the concrete sin in the essence it is the distillation the Quint ascensions of all things that are vile it is not envious against God it is Envy it is not at enmity it is actual enmity now you know why the Apostle Paul would say let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you so we notice what is truth today truth is the absolute standard by which reality is measured truth truth is God's view on any subject situation question or idea truth is not what a scholar says truth is not even what a theologian says I'll go further truth is not what a preacher says just because a preacher says it doesn't make it true just because a great man says it doesn't make it true let me go further can I bring it a little bit further down the message is not what I say it is the message is not what some man in Africa says or some man in in the Middle East it doesn't the message of the hour is not what I make it it's not what you make it let me say it this way the message is what it is let me make it even clear the truth is not what I say it's not what you say the truth speaks for itself Hallelujah and so notice what happens this is exactly what the Bible says the truth is the truth is not what I make it it's not what the preacher makes it it's not what the example that you've seen the message is what it is it's God's Vindicated word and it came not from a man not from a Kentucky hillbilly it came from the Throne of God do you realize the message of the hour is not William branham's message I know that's unpopular for some people but it wasn't even his message a prophet of God said I was just standing there when he appeared so do you realize when you walk away from the message you're not walking away away from brother brandom I said when you walk away from this truth you're not walking away from a pro from a a man from Kentucky you're walking away from God because it wasn't brother bram's message it was listen when you rejected Isaiah you weren't rejecting Isaiah Isaiah was just the Mailman who the message came through when you rejected Jeremiah and called Jeremiah crazy called him a false prophet called him a li call him dishonest call him whatever you want to call him you're not rejecting Jeremiah you are rejecting the throne room of God cuz the message came from the throne into the lips of a prophet unto the people and so when you were rejecting Jeremiah you didn't receive Jeremiah's curse either you weren't going to receive the wrath of Jeremiah hello somebody you weren't going to receive the anger or the wrath of Isaiah when you walked away from Isaiah you were going to receive the wrath of God and let me go further when you accepted Jeremiah's message you weren't accepting Jeremiah's message you were accepting the message from the throne and when you accept the message of the hour you're not accepting the message of a Kentucky man you're accepting a voice from heaven and let me go further you don't receive the blessing from from a man you receive a blessing from God the prophet wasn't the author of the message he was just the mailman or the messenger do you realize even the Book of Revelation wasn't John's book it was the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him and he bore record of it and the testimony of Jesus Christ of all things that he saw so brother Brandon was not who I say he was he's not who any man says he was he was who the truth said that he was and what is the truth it's the word it's the thought of God expressed and it's not communicated by emotion and it's not in communicated by intellect let me say this the re the truth of the hour is not communicated by either emotion or or your intellectuals all right you could try to understand it I could try to draw it out on a whiteboard and try on chalkboard I could try to paint it out clearly before you and you could try with your best to grasp it and even understand the knowledge of it but brother brandom says you can have the knowledge and not have the Revelation it's not communicated by a human dialect it's a language that a human can't speak I preach it we preach it we teach it absolutely we do but it takes God to come and reveal it and seal it inside of your heart but we live in a bewitching world a world that says you know uh uh you've got to have proof you've got to have a a Vindication I'm just going to go ahead and preach today and I'll let the chips fall where they will brother Donnie can clean it up after I get done let me say something to the young people young people you don't need to research this message I said you don't need to research this message the message has already been Vindicated the message isn't to be researched not to be did it did it make sense does it make right listen friends it's already been Vindicated and God put a seal of approval on it God Vindicated it and backed it with his presence night after night I don't need to have an answer to the critic I've already got my answer my answer is right here living in my heart it's already all the proof that I need is what the message has changed and done in my heart let me go further you don't need to answer the question questions of unbelievers it's a perversion of First Peter 3 give an answer be ready at the any moment to get an A give an answer to every man about the hope that lays within you listen friends that's a perversion to say I've got to answer every single question in fact if you go just a little a few more verses Paul says foolish questions and unlearned don't even answer don't don't even give them your attention you ought not give it your attention I don't need to answer let me give you the words of my good buddy brother Wayne Lawson I don't need to answer those questions cuz they're not my questions they're the questions of unbelievers and unbelievers will unbelieve you know what an unbeliever will do he'll unbelieve you know what a make believer will do he'll make believe but you know what a Believer will do a Believer will believe the word of God because that's who he is because that's what he is he's a Believer what you'll find in the Bible is you will never find Peter and Paul and these men arguing and debating you won't find that in the Bible you won't find Paul trying to get out or Peter try to get out a chalkboard and draw it all out and act like a scholar and try to give a scholarly answer and try to give an answer that makes perfect sense to the human mind none of these examples you'll find in the Bible will show you them trying to be a intellectual men arguing with intellectual arguments because the human mind is enmity with God do you realize this is the approach of the modern Church a scientific approach towards the word of God and if you don't have that if you don't have a scientific approach on one ditch you're going to have an emotional approach on another itch it's what I understand or it's what I feel all right but you know this is the way the world approaches everything is they got to have a rational reason to believe something it's got to make sense you see what you find is is that the Bible prophesied that this age men would become lovers of their own self now that doesn't mean they get in the mirror and go oh man look at me at least I hope they don't oh man look at I just love myself listen friends do you know that's not the prophecy that would come upon this world what comes upon this world is the love of self to where I can understand it I can rationalize it I can reason it out scientifically I can prove it and that's all brother bam said the denominational church was just Anointed with the spirit of argument I'm just going to go ahead and say it you're not anointed to argue you get yourself in trouble trying to do that that's not your an anointing your anointing is not a man anointing your anointing is an eagle to where you rise All Above It what is your power it's a power of Revelation that God reveals it and speaks it and you say Lord I might not be able to understand it I might not even feel it but I believe it with all that's within me God I believe it with my body with my soul and with my spirit it was the power of Revelation wow I heard a man the other day on on a YouTube video good old YouTube and it was a c it was a scholar and that scholar was so amazed it was an awesome video I mean I love all of it it was an awesome video but the scholars two Christian men both of them Christian Scholars Dallas Theological Seminary trained beautiful you know minds of these men and that they they were so encouraged because they had went to an archaeological dig uh you know recently of Sodom and Gomorrah and actually they have found on the Dead Sea what they believed to be the the mo the the the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah two twin cities by the Dead Sea and these men these these they go into this archaeological dig and they they ask them these questions of what did they find at the destruction layer what did they find at the what destroyed Sodom and gomorra and the man AR archaeologist didn't want to answer the question he sort of walked away shut away the live stream was on so they got with him afterward said you got to tell us did you find arrows at the destruction layer if you find arrows that means that men destroy the city some Army and he said no what we learned is that they said we didn't find any arrows they said well how was Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed and they said well we call it a heat event he said what in the world's a heat event and he said well what we found was is we found pottery and he says at first we we notied the pot we thought we had found the you know the true dig of the ancient city and he said but we flipped it over and we realized that there was glazing on the back of the pottery and he says we realized real quick you know we the the the digs been tainted because there was no glazing didn't come till the Ottoman Empire about 700 AD and so this couldn't be Sodom and he said but there was something different about the glazing on the pottery and he said so we took that Pottery we would sent it to a lab in New York City didn't tell them what it was we just said Analyze This glazing and he said the scientist came back and said that's not glazing on the back of that Pottery they said well what is that they said well that's actually triopo Tite well what in the world is triop Tite and they said actually that what you see triop Tite is when something reaches nuclear bomb level heat so you know what they've concluded Sodom and Gomorrah was nuked I could have told him that before they ever found the proof it was nuke from above from a nuclear bomb from the almighty God who rained fire and brimstone [Applause] down you say brother Matt did that put your faith now you believe the Bible uh-uh that didn't do anything for listen I love it I believe I I love it just as much as they do but it was incredible because the man went on to say he said you know I was so encouraged he said because I've always looked at Sodom and Gomorrah as a mythical part of the Bible I couldn't believe it I reer rounded it 5 Second back I got to hear that again I always believe he said yeah I did too I always looked at that you know Noah's Arc that was just mythical parts of the Bible friend I'm just going to goe and tell you if I believe there were mythical Parts in that Bible I'd throw it out if I believe that God just made something up it was a mythical part I'd just throw it out they did the same thing with pilot Stone do you know that I was reading 2/3 of of Christian Scholars 2third of Christian Scholars never believe that pontis pilot ever existed they beli there was some procurator that that was there at that time but it wasn't pontis pilot was just a name that the writer sort of just made up come on you know what happened though I was just in Israel went to the Israeli Museum and I found I seen the pilot Stone a capital Stone I think it was in the 50s that these archaeologists came and dug up and they found this this stone with the name pontis pilate and you know what those two-thirds of Christian Scholars did they said oh I guess he did exist I guess I do believe it you know what I'm so glad that I didn't need a stone with the name of pontis pilot some kind of intellectual proof but I already believed it inside of my heart blessed are your eyes who haven't seen but have still believed blessed are they that believe I don't need proof I don't need a newspaper article I don't need some testimony or some video I've already got the newspaper article it's downside of my [Applause] [Music] heart I don't need to prove it but what you'll find is the modern church has so deducted it down to a scientific understanding of the word do you realize when people leave the message over the hour this is the route that they are going if they will be honest and take that same critical thinking that they call it amen yeah I guarantee it's critical it's anointed from a demon Spirit called a demon of criticism it's Common Sense critical thinking you got to look at this rationally you got to look at it you know rationally got to look at it theologically and this is how they view things This Is How They approach things it's got to be understood and and that they've deducted it down you know what the modern church have done they have so analyzed the Bible that they take a scientific approach that when they are done Mark 16 ah it was added the woman at the well we got to admit it's actually not there in the original manuscript and it was added Mark 16's gone they have so analyzed it woman at the well is gone uh uh they Chuck out anything that seems unreasonable to believe by their carnal mind as poetry they have textual variance and textual criticism and eschatology and harmonics and apologetics let me just go ahead and say I I if you ever get to the point to where we've got to apologize for the message of the hour we ought to just throw it out if we got to apologize to people and say I'm sorry about this we might as well hang up Prince let me say you don't need eschatology and harmonics and and all of these intellectual things what you need is revelation what you need need is a [Applause] demonstration the world doesn't need a de the world doesn't need a an interpretation they need a revelation that'll produce a demonstration but she has the word you say brother Matt what is your answer to the questions I've got the word demonstrated in my life can I go a little bit further you see what happens is as people people have got to have scientific educational proof they'll either go to one side or the other yeah I'm not going to get into it today I had it but I'm just going to skip it but you notice that there's all of these isms that you find in truth and and you'll always find it's always so amazing to me people will either go to one side or the other always there's always a ditch on both sides brother Brandon would stand against this as Ministry over and over and over again let me give you one quote he says some people make Church a Frolic others make it a funeral service oh dear God help us I'd rather have a Frolic than a funeral service I'd be honest but brother bam says some people make it a funeral some people make Church of Frolic and brother brandham says it's neither it's a feast and he says and the true bride goes down the middle of the but you see what Satan will do he'll always try to get us into ditches he'll always try to brother ad him says push your off to one extreme and if he can't get you over on that extreme he'll get you over on this extreme if he can't make you a dry-eyed intellectual to where everything's got to be scientific proof then it'll make you believe that unless you had some you know chill bump or some kind of sensation in your body then you didn't even have church there was actually no anointing there because no one shouted or screamed listen friends there's a ditch on both sides all right there's a ditch on some on both sides it's always amazing to me because I've always seen one or two things will happen with people you take the message of the hour take God's Prophet they'll either deify or they'll deemphasize I said they'll either deify the words of a prophet and say say it was you know the the literal Voice or they'll say you know what it was just his opinion y'all y'all never heard that you never am I the only one you'll find one or two ways always one or two ditches this is the devil's tactic I've watched some say we don't need emotion then I've watched others say we don't need teaching others say we don't need dancing well Mariam danced before the Lord David dance before the Lord dancing didn't start in the upper room it started in the back part of God's mind before the foundation of the world shouting didn't start in Acts shouting started in the mind of God when the sons of God shouted for Joy I give you the words of a Prophet this is an old time religion that we got this is the original faith that we got but you watch some cut out dancing then others who cut out dancing who who say we need who others who won't cut out dancing cut out brotherly love and say it doesn't matter how you treat each other doesn't matter if we love our neighbor well all right some cut out some emphasize the gifts others emphasiz the fruits some cut out the tapes and say we don't need the tap tapes we just need the Bible others say uh some cut out preachers and say we don't need preachers do you see the two extremes always one say we don't need the tapes other say we don't need preachers some say we don't need the message others say we don't need the Bible some cut out repentance others cut out Grace it's the tactic of the devil to push us into ditches but God's family goes down the middle of the road you say brother matth then what do we need you need dancing you need shouting you need the fruits you need the gifts you need preachers you need the tapes you need your Bible what are you saying you need all that God has for his family you need all of the gifts and all of the joy you need all of [Applause] it and then there's a spirit that says you don't need need to quote Brother brandom come on aren't we quoting brother brandom so much brother Matt I mean how long are we going to quote brother Brandon when are you going to get past a prophet when are we going to grow up and get P aren't you this out of man tell me that aren't we just carnal always brother brand we ashamed of that saying brother brandham said and the prophet said and the prophet said and the prophet said come on don't you know do you realize the spirit that's on that is a spirit that doesn't want to surrender to the headship of the word and so when they can remove the prophet they can remove the authority of the backing of God from that prophet's message and then they can get down and argue it to everybody's opinion we don't need the prophet anymore come on when you going to get past the prophet when you going to stop quoting I'm going to tell you what I told him I ain't never going to stop quoting a prophet when you're going to get past a prophet I ain't never going to get past a prophet when we going to grow up and be mature I'll tell you when when we start quoting a prophet and start saying what the prophet said that that's when but that's when the real power of God will come when we say what a prophet [Applause] said do we need to quote a prophet well do you realize Jesus lived and preached constantly under the knowledge that he was fulfilling the words of prophets Luke 18 behold we go up to Jerusalem and all things are written by the prophets concerning the son of man Luke 24-25 Jesus abraded them saying he said oh fools and slow of heart to believe all you mean there's some who only believe some you fools and slow of heart to believe oh come on say it with me that the prophets have spoken acts 3:24 I love this Paul clearly states prophets speak to the to the last days yay and all the prophets from Samuel and all those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days you know John the Baptist understood and preached the message of prophets he didn't need a new revelation or a new doctrine or a new idea he was just quoting what the prophet said in those days John the Baptist Matthew 3:1 saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand the this is the voice of one crying in the wilderness all through the New Testament and then notice this in Matthew 8:16 when even would come they brought to men who were demon-possessed let me get to it and he said and this was and healed all him who were ill in order that it was spoken through Isaiah the prophet so if Jesus preached the message of prophets if Paul preached the message of prophets if John preached the message of prophets then I think I'll quote from a prophet of God Hallelujah because it would be that message that would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers do you realize Joshua God understood this and so God tells Joshua I want you to take 12 men and he says and he says notice this here look at Joshua chapter 4 and he says when the priest feet touch the water now Jordan was going to represent death it was going to represent sin right it was going to represent the final death you could say the crossing over and and and so God tells Joshua now we're going to cross over Jordan what do I want you to do I want you to take 12 men and he says and you're going to represent all of the nation of Israel these 12 men are going to represent every single tribe and he says and when the priest feet Touch the Water water in other words when they actually put their feet in death now not when they think about it there you go not when they what not when that they're imagining in their mind you see sometimes it takes action to move God sometimes God a wait for a natural thing to do a supernatural thing hello somebody you think your amens don't matter when hadti Wright didn't think it but when she spoke it with her mouth and said Amen brother brandham do you think your amens listen friends God sometimes waits for a natural thing to send a supernatural thing do you know why cuz you you say it's not important to say Amen to the word of God long as I just nod long as I say yeah just under my breath do you realize your words have the power to change the atmosphere do you realize that your words an amen a vocal amen agreement with the word of God have the ability to enter into an atmosphere and change the entire atmosphere around you you might be surrounded by doubt by depression by trouble by struggle I challenge you this morning say Amen to the word of God and watch what it'll do to that Spirit of Doubt around you watch what it'll do to that depression around you it'll change the atmosphere when you pull on a man of God what does it do it changes the circumstances around you prophet of God said when she spoke those words it felt like the room was about to come apart so it's when these priests put their feet in not when they think about it not when they when they you know when they get bold and boisterous what all you wait wait till what I'm going to listen friends a lot of people can talk a big talk but it TR takes a true man of God to put his foot out there in Jordan now listen the Bible says when they Place their feet in the Jordan Jordan part not the whole river but the place where his feet stands this is very different than Moses taking a staff and planted it in the water in all of the Nations David said the water stood up as a heap this isn't what happens in Jordan but actually it's not going to be the ministry of a Prophet come on somebody it's going to be the ministry of Faithful Men priests who plac their feet in the Jordan and God says I want you to take those men and have them plac their foot in the Jordan and when they put their foot their Jordan apart so the next man takes another step and a little bit more Jordan and another step and a little bit more Jordan and another step listen friends these men were doing things that no one else had to do let me just stop here and preach by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit men of God in your life life will have to go through things you never May ever experience in your life they will face things in spirits the families of those men not just the pastor not just the Evangelist but the families even the children will go through things those High priests were going to go through things that they would never you would never understand or even be able to relate with yeah amen because they were bearing the burdens of the rest of everybody else do you realize the weight upon a man to put his foot in the Jordan and when he puts there he's stepping into sin he's stepping into death and the Bible says that when they Place their foot there then Jordan Will part and you notice what happens when these men stand there come here Brothers come here all of you you three here come here come here Brothers you three here come here I want you to stand these three face the audience these three face them come here Brother come on come on don't be ashamed now come on shouldn't say ashamed don't be embarrassed it's all right face each other one more come on brother one more stand here I want you to notice this here this is the order that God wants them to cross through Jordan because it was going to be men that plac their feet in Jordan to where Jordan which represented sin it represented death it represented disease it represented everything of s sin would bring with it and when they placed their feet Jordan would part and the families would walk through the priest they would walk through and they'd go from Cana they'd go into Canaan and through Jordan into the promised land because there were priests who were standing there in the water and they would pass through listen friends these men have something on their shoulder that you ought to pray you ought to support you ought to say bless the man of God bless my pastor bless his family who's standing in the Jordan for me now what would happen let me ask you something what would happen if this brother who was going through a trial and he let his discouragement get him down so low that he stepped out of Jordan what happens if this brother got a spirit on him to listen to the to the Antichrist spirit that saying stop preaching close your iPad just push play and then this brother over here takes that hard trial and that hard circumstance and he just ain't got the strength to stand up anymore because he ain't got a church that'll support him and then he steps out do you realize what would happen if men of God stopped preaching the message of the hour do you realize what would happen if anointed vessels and consecrated men took their foot out of Jordan compromise would flood our church sin would flood our church diseases would flood our church do you realize what they're holding back you ought to say thank God for a man of God who will place his feet in Jordan Hallelujah and do we have a church that'll say to their Pastor preach the word of God preach the truth of God give it to me straight Pastor keep your foot in Jordan oh Hallelujah you want to thank God for a man of God God puts in your life I say preacher keep your foot in Jordan don't compromise don't look to the left or to the right amen if we ever had a time where we need men to be men to stand for truth amen it would be these stones of where they stood that would literally turn the hearts of people children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers hello somebody do you realize what the church what the what the truth and the preaching of the truth has the power to do it has the power to change circumstances it has the power to change lives it has the power power to block you from going to hell it has the power to anoint your faith when you're discouraged it has the power one day the preaching of the word will change your your faith in that word will change your body one day why do you think Satan hates it let me say this Satan don't hate preachers in fact he's got a lot of them what he hates is what's being preached it would be in Timothy let's look at it together it would actually be in the book of Timothy that would say that they would Heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears is that what it says they would let me find it here that they would have he they would Heap unto themselves in second Timothy chapter 4 turn there with me if you could we're not going to be can I have just a few more minutes come on Amen and so notice the 2 Timothy chapter 4 this is verse one I charge thee therefore before God I want you to notice the soberness and seriousness of the Apostle Paul when he says this this isn't a you know Timothy good advice would be you know if you want to live your best life now listen friends that gospel that Joel Lo's preaching is a gospel from the pits of Hell live your best life now I got news for you this better not be my best life now my best life now this is my worst life now my best life is where my treasure is over in another land in another dimension in another city with real people and real joy and real life Paul says I charge you in other words I command you Timothy before God and the Lord Jesus who shall judge the quick and the dead he didn't have to add all that but he wants to show how important how sober this commission was going to be I command you I charge you verse two preach the word be instant in season out of season in other words even when you don't feel like it I tell you what friends most of the time if if if I'd be honest as a lot of times I get up to preaching I don't feel like it I got so much discouragement on me feel like sometimes I just feel like such a miserable failure and you know such a you know a miserable wret Lord who am I to be preaching but you know what I got a commission on my life that says this ain't about you it's not about your personality it's not about what I've done for you it's a gift I placed in your life preach the word reprove rebuke but Lord reprove re rebuke but they're not going to like that Lord that's not going to put 20,000 people in my church but it'll change people's bodies one day Hallelujah preach the word reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine do you know what that's not what people want they want preaching but they don't want rebuke they don't want reproval just give me something that makes me feel good you know just feel good vibes just make me feel fuzzy and warm inside all good about myself listen friends that's not always what the word of God comes to do sometimes it does come to encourage other times it comes to challenge other times it comes to rebuke we ought to be able to say Amen Lord no matter if it hurts if I got to say ouch Oh Me Oh my help me Lord I was watching a man I'm not here to criticize him but it was so amazing Harry is before his massive mega church audience 20 30,000 people y'all forgive me for keep tucking my shirt and I lost some weight since the last time I wore this suit it sense this belt up he was preaching in this art this church 20,000 people and he's up there and and he's going to make a statement to all of the transgender community in his church and you could just see the nerves on this man as as I'm not judging the man in any way I don't know his motive but he was wanting to make a statement and he and he's trying to be careful about his words and he's trying to walk real real carefully and not hurting and say it the right way use the right words not say the wrong words right pronouns not the wrong pronouns and he's going to try to say and he and he says we we just want to say to the trans Community we love you we we welcome you in our midst we're not here to judge you we're not here to condemn you and you can see the man is just nervous and finally the people just feeling they start clapping and the whole audience just begins to go in a Roar and you get to see the man oh thank God I got past that and I thought to myself I said you poor man you don't realize you're trying to help them but you'll never help them by petting them you see a spirit loves to be petted it loves when you walk around it and are real careful how you speak to it and real careful let me just go ahead and say it you'll never help them that way you got to preach the truth you got to tell them the truth of God there's only one thing that'll set a spirit free the truth sets you free I say give me the bear knuckle gospel give me it straight brother give me the pure unadulterated word of God give me the infallible unadulterated Mind Of God do we have a church that feels that way preach it to me brother preach me the word of [Applause] God you're going to find the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine they won't be men anymore but they'll Heap unto themselves teachers preachers having itching ears ah just just I got to hear it tell me how good I am yeah God loves you God loves me I love me too God wants the best for you amazing I want the best for me too do you realize what that kind of preaching does to a carnal heart say brother Matt does God love you yes he does does God want the best for you yes he does but you notice this though Heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables stories imaginations funny comedies funny skits funny stories this is what fills up our churches a comedy routine with a band come on do you realize that's how mega churches are formed I read a questionnaire they go into a community they're called Church planners where there's no massive Church there they'll go into the community and they'll send out mailers and in that mailer I'm reading you I'm telling you something real in that mailer they would they have check boxes what kind of church do you like do you like a church where it's dark or do you like it traditional with lots of Lights do you like a band on the stage you know more new age young a young young young band or do you like more of the traditional kind of worship music do you like drums do you like n do you just like an organ uh how about the carpet how about the colors how about the kind of preacher do you like a more theological or do you like more of a charismatic type and these people fill out this questionnaire and they check check check and then they build a church around the likes and dislikes of a community do you realize what's so backwards about that the people have replaced the position of God as the one who's to be worshiped and entertained I got news for you I ain't here to be seen I ain't here to make to be made to feel good I'm here to Worship the Lord and say God it's not about what I want it's about what you want lord it's not about what I need it's about what you need Lord Jesus and they're so Under Pressure I am so glad I have no denominational board to answer to I'm so glad that I don't have any group that I've got to make happy or make or pleased listen friends do you realize that's what our churches uh denominational churches have become they're so Under Pressure cuz they got to please this group or that group or say the right thing to not offend this and offend that I'm here to say I've got one person to pleas I've got one man I want to please Amen brother bham says what's gotten to the place as John Wesley says what one generation tolerates the next generation will Embrace and he's gotten to a place to where brother benam says they don't they don't let me read you this quote here before we get to that can I have just five minutes I'll try my best to be good about my word oh God that's like the pull pit where is man man that's man that stands for a principle where is women that stands for a principle you see you can stand for the word and never open your mouth you can stand people say I'll stand for the word I'm going to go argue and fuss I'm I'm get into a Facebook argument and I'm going to get into a great debate with them I'm going to prove them wrong listen friends that's not your anointing you ain't standing for the truth arguing and fussing and fighting you say how do I stand for the Truth live the Truth live What You Preach live what you believe brother B says what is a man where's a church that stands for a principle I ain't got a nickel's worth of time for a wishy-washy give in compromising spirit a woman is a woman let her be a lady if a man is a man let him be a man if he's a president where's our John Quincy Adams where's our Abraham Lincoln's men of principle where's our Patrick Henry said Give me liberty or give me death where's a man that stands for what's right where's the man that's not afraid to speak out regardless if the whole world is against him speak out for what's right and stand for it and die for it there's Arnold Von Winker again today listen you know this quote very well where's Men of Integrity where's men of spirit they're so wishy-washy and gummed up until they don't know where they stand God let me stand with the principles of one man as a minister how many could say this the word of Jesus [Music] Christ but what happens is Satan backs us down into a little corner somewhere and intimidates us yeah you know the Devil is a Spirit of intimidation he'll back you off of the promises of God yeah well maybe that wasn't for me brother Adam says that's the way in perseverance I sent this also brother if you have it that's the way you want to get to God be on his hands every morning every night every day constantly just keep seeking keep asking asking keep knocking just don't knock a little while keep knocking just don't knock a little while and get tired and go away just keep standing and say there Lord I'm here I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands now I'm going to stay right here you getting tired listening I'm having a great time knocking cuz I know you're coming amen that's when something happen happens he has to get you off his hand see he comes out to answer now Faith finds this I love this now there's only one thing can hold this sword that's the hand of Faith the hand of faith is the only thing that can yield this sword of Faith sword of the word now you might have a weak arm how many be honest here today and say my arm is not always strong just enough to pick it up for justification you're so weak maybe that's all you can cut through but the sword of the word will cut free every promise somebody say every every promise that God made in it if they get a good strong arm of Faith holding it there I believe God for my healing I believe God for my baptism God made the promise and Faith holds this sword every promise of God can be cut free by the word of God for it is a sword but you know what the problem is like that little woman brother brandham said she had so many hindrances you got that brother she had so many hindrances but her faith praise the Lord I got so many hindrances how many can identify and say I've got so many things that block me so many things that's oh I want to stand for it I want to believe it Lord but I got so much blocking me but I got news for you your faith don't have any you might have a lot of hindrances every person starts out to meet Christ you find you got a lot of hindrances but your faith don't have any faith don't have no hindrance faith has hairs on its chest oh boy go put this in the modern world I tell you what they'd call you all kinds of names I'm going to tell you what a prophet said faith has hair on its chest great big muscles read raises up and said you know it's reasonable Faith pulls his muscles back sticks out his big chest and says shut up and sit down Hallelujah that's what you want to tell the devil who's plaguing your mind shut up and sit down devil get back in your corner I'm a believer I'm Victorious I'm the mighty Army of the Living God shut up devil reason jumps right over and sits and takes his stool you say I'm not allowed to say shut up I'm telling you giving you permission young person you can tell the devil to shut up all reason jumps over in a corner and takes a stool faith has got muscles he means what he says just press right on through your faith takes you right on faith has no hindrance it goes on anyhow and listen to this nothing is going to stop it I said it's Brony it's got big muscles it's got the Flor you need to take the microphone away from the devil and say give me back that microphone you don't belong to have it I don't want to hear what you got to say I don't want to hear your reasoning and your Whispering I got the microphone now and I'm going to speak I believe thank you Lord amen Lord amen it's got the microphone it's got the floor rest of them scared of it head they'll run from it it's like small poox they just get Plum away haven't got nothing to do with that when big Faith Rises up say I know who I believe I'm persuaded there is no fear in faith faith knows all about it Faith as I always said it's got great big muscles and hair on his chest faith says shut up and everybody shuts up you know what you ought to do let me give you some real simple principled medicine for that anxiety and that depression when you feel that Spirit of anxiety and depression come upon you start opening your mouth don't think it start opening your mouth and reading the word of God start quoting the word of God I promise you when your words when your words go to quoting the word of God it'll shut the devil of depression up in your life it'll shut that Spirit of anxiety up and say no weapon formed against me shall prosper they shall cast out n devils in my name if they ask anything in my name and don't doubt they'll have what they ask for greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world but you've got to stand up and show your muscles that's all Faith speaks it Faith speaks it notice Pharaoh used his wisdom on Moses watch he said I'll tell you what I'll make an agreement with you after the plagues done eat him up he said I'll make an agreement with you you just go for a little worship three days just go so far and don't go no further but you know that was just Pharaoh senses told him to say told him that you just go so far you know that's what the devil gets people to do you know don't go out there a little bit but don't go crazy with it don't become a fanatic do you know what a fanatic is it's just a fan and I got news for the devil I'm a fan of Jesus I guess that makes me a fanatic he says I tell you what you do you just go so far and don't go no further but you know what that you know what the faith that Moses had didn't believe in a so far religion he said we're all going we're going all the way that's right we're going to the promised land we don't just go out here and make a denomination and stop we go on through I'm going all the way to the promised land but how many pharaohs do we got well we got standing in the pull pit heads of organization now if you'll just do this and do that that's all we'll just you know we see just go so far Moses said oh no no no Pharaoh said well why not if you're going to have that kind of religion I'll tell you what you do just you and all the Elders go worship you see Satan doesn't mind what US old folks do what he's concerned about is what you young folks do cuz he knows if he can get the young people he'll kill it by generation he says I tell you what you do all you elders just go worship you just Elders go worship because you can have all that kind of religion but don't get it among the people you know what Moses said there won't be even a hoof you know just that that that lost loved one just you know they're gone man just get just be thankful for what you got in your family that child just they're gone just be thankful listen this is what the devil will try to tell you I got news what you ought to tell the devil is devil I ain't leaving one child I'm not leaving one mother I'm not leaving one father we ain't leaving anybody we're all going I said we're all going oh Mom you ought to let that anoint your faith today and say you can't have my child I'm taking a stand against you that's my inheritance before [Applause] [Music] God as long brother listen says as long as I'm here I'm on your hands Pharaoh that's who he's talking to and as long as I'm here I'm on your hands I'm not going unless they can go too and what a gallant servant amen I want to take them with me well now that's brother Bram says now he says well now just be he says what a gallent servant I want to take them with me just because I've got it and I sit down and say well now this is all right no sir we want the people too every one of us is going he said we ain't going to even leave every she we a't we we ain't going to even leave every sheep or anything behind there's not going to be a hoof left we're all

are we're going on any how there isn't going to be one of us left every one of us is going and we ain't going to stop nothing else you know finally Pharaoh said get out finally Pharaoh said get out God had just plagued him with the voice of Moses he struck everything and done everything there was to be done he stopped he put the sun down in the middle of the day he done everything he blackened the days he brought the frogs fleas lights everything else fire smoke death to his families everything else he done everything till finally finally pharoh had to say get out take it all take all you got and go do you realize what you do to the devil when you come to church and you feel so down and so low and so discouraged yet you still raise up those hands and say I love you Lord it doesn't matter how I can feel doesn't matter what I think you know what you do you're plaguing the devil with your worship I said you're plaguing the devil when you feel like you can't make it but you put one foot in in front of the other and you keep walking and you keep pressing and you keep pulling oh friends one day Satan's going to say just get out take all you got oh how many wants to accept that by faith stand to your feet and say Satan I'm on your hands now and I'm leaving with everything that God has promised me I'm leaving with my children I'm leaving with my mind I'm leaving with everything the Lord has promised in my life oh give the Lord another hand clap of Praise he's worthy hallelujah how many can say Lord today I raise a hand and I want to say I want to take a stand for the truth how many can bow your heads and raise your hand and say Lord Jesus in spite of everything the devil has thrown my way in spite of every Rock he's thrown at me every weapon he's used against me yeah he's got me he's stung me he's blooded up me sometimes but I'm here to say I'm still standing devil I'm still coming after my promise I'm not leaving I'm not going to quit I'm not going to walk away
