[35:57] yet you in your love for us has made a
[36:01] way of escape Lord and father in the
[36:06] human and our inability Lord
[36:09] can't even speak big words but yet Lord

[36:18] it feels to say to you Lord we love you
[36:22] and we adore you and we magnify your
[36:25] name Lord we asked this morning that you

[36:37] that they may take courage Lord for
[36:41] father we realize we are not here just
[36:43] play in church it's not something that
[36:47] we just do Lord as just a part of our
[36:50] life but Lord we believe this morning
[36:53] that it is our life Lord and we want to
[36:58] be about the father's business and we
[37:01] pray this morning Lord that your word
[37:04] would strike our hearts that we could
[37:06] take courage to take our position Lord
[37:10] for father if we are the body of Christ
[37:13] if Satan can get us dislocated the Lord
[37:18] I've seen in surgery when people come in
[37:20] with dislocated hips and and dislocated
[37:23] shoulders how painful it is they've
[37:26] still got a leg but it don't function
[37:28] and Oh Lord if the enemy can just get us
[37:31] off of our position Lord but God may
[37:35] each of us today find our place Lord and
[37:38] stand upon it Lord that great things

[38:14] things in Jesus name and the bride says
[38:18] I mean god bless you may be seated this
[38:20] morning
[38:25] chosen to be a soldier there is as we
[38:32] all well know this morning a war and
[38:36] this war is going on between two armies
[38:40] it is an army of darkness and it is an
[38:45] army of light and I want you to
[38:48] understand this morning that you have
[38:50] been chosen into this army of light to
[38:54] serve this wasn't a draft it wasn't just
[38:58] a random draft that God that you're your
[39:01] number came up and you was drafted nor
[39:03] did you have to register for selective
[39:05] service I want you to understand this
[39:09] morning that this may be a volunteers
[39:11] faith but what I'm talking about this
[39:13] morning it's not a volunteer army you
[39:16] didn't have north could you choose to be
[39:19] here you were chosen before the
[39:23] foundation of the world I want you to
[39:26] understand this morning
[39:27] you were chosen by God to be a soldier
[39:30] in the army of God Jesus said you have
[39:34] not chosen me but I have chosen you and
[39:38] ordained you that you should go forth
[39:40] and bring forth fruit they should that
[39:42] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[39:45] he shall ask the Father in my name it
[39:48] may be given to you this battle that
[39:52] we've been called to fight in it'sit's
[39:54] not just something that started last
[39:56] week it's been raging for years the
[39:59] brother said this great first battle
[40:01] that was ever fault
[40:02] it began in heaven when Michael and his
[40:05] angels fought against Lucifer and his
[40:07] angels it first started the first battle
[40:10] was in heaven so sin did not originate
[40:14] on earth in originating in heaven and
[40:17] then it was thrown down from Earth cast
[40:20] out of heaven to earth and fellow human
[40:22] beings then the battle from Angels
[40:25] became human battles
[40:29] and Satan has come to destroy the Bible
[40:35] said to defendant but for one purpose
[40:37] that's the kill and steal and to destroy
[40:40] so we understand that Satan has come to
[40:44] destroy God's creation he wants to
[40:48] destroy what God has created for himself
[40:52] that's what Satan's arm it's what he's
[40:55] come to do is to destroy this that's
[40:57] what his purpose was was destroy it the
[41:01] battle began here on earth and now it's
[41:03] even raging in US and the Prophet said
[41:05] it's been raised and ever since and our
[41:08] commander-in-chief I want you to
[41:10] understand he could have placed you in
[41:12] any part of the battle that he chose he
[41:16] can replace you in the battle for
[41:18] justification he could have placed you
[41:20] in the battle for sanctification he
[41:22] could have placed you in the battle for
[41:24] the restoration of the gifts but he
[41:26] chose to place you in this hour
[41:29] of great darkness he did not place here
[41:32] he chose you for this hour that you
[41:36] could be called to the frontlines
[41:38] now I know many times when we talk about
[41:40] war and we talked about battle sisters
[41:42] say well you know that's a man's thing
[41:44] that's got nothing to do with me this
[41:46] message has nothing to do me but I want
[41:48] you to understand anyone that's been in
[41:50] the Army realizes there's different
[41:52] divisions of the army they are soldiers
[41:55] who are called to be infantrymen they
[41:58] pack weapons they march with boots when
[42:00] I was in the Army I was in I always in
[42:02] artillery
[42:03] our job was to support those that fought
[42:05] with the rifles we thought with the big
[42:07] gun but not everybody fights out of the
[42:11] trench in an army even the Battlefront
[42:14] army they have cooks
[42:16] [Applause]
[42:19] amen
[42:21] but could studies play you can't fight
[42:23] real good on an empty stomach so you may
[42:28] not be called to be an apostle but you
[42:30] as a sister have been called chosen by
[42:33] God in his army to work in your kitchen
[42:36] [Applause]
[42:37] [Music]
[42:40] suppliers different transporters those
[42:43] different positions but the whole thing
[42:46] makes us a battlefront battle-hardened
[42:49] army amen God has called us to the
[42:54] frontlines for this last great assault
[42:57] on Satan's Kingdom I want you to
[43:00] understand this morning we've been
[43:02] called to do two things we've been
[43:05] called to build up our father's Kingdom
[43:08] but we've also been called to destroy
[43:12] Satan's Kingdom oh yeah I was born to

[51:41] disbelieve God's Word and same up a
[51:43] better Kingdom then Michael had and God
[51:45] cast him out

[59:35] be smooth sailin
[59:40] come on the ship of Zion was got a
[59:44] buffet and everything just the Prophet
[59:57] said don't never get that in your head
[1:00:00] for I become the Christian to fight and
[1:00:03] to fight the good fight of faith I
[1:00:05] become a Christian to get into the
[1:00:07] battle and when you gather that day
[1:00:10] around this table that won't be one spot
[1:00:13] or wrinkle but he said there will be
[1:00:14] stars scarred soldiers of the cross the
[1:00:21] men stood out there you know the Roman
[1:00:23] in the head the parade and the guy stood
[1:00:25] out there and all of them the shoes were
[1:00:26] sounding the brass was sounding look
[1:00:28] pleased with everything was just right
[1:00:29] and there's a guy sitting out there his
[1:00:31] eye was all cut out he stars all over
[1:00:33] his face he tried to salute but he
[1:00:35] couldn't his arm didn't work right he
[1:00:39] saw the man standing there he tried his
[1:00:41] best even though he was wounded even
[1:00:43] though he was scarred he still was in
[1:00:46] the ranks well he stopped the chest in
[1:00:52] you you're there where did you get those
[1:00:55] scars I got them in service for my king
[1:01:02] he said you you will ride with me today
[1:01:14] when I was in the army we had to work we
[1:01:17] worked in the what we called the motor
[1:01:19] pool we I was on a one five five Howard
[1:01:21] had like a chrome barrel we could shoot
[1:01:23] around the 21 miles on a max charge of a
[1:01:26] green bag a charge so we'd go out and be
[1:01:29] firing those those are the the
[1:01:31] condensation whatever the the barrels
[1:01:33] would rust so we'd have to go back when
[1:01:34] we come in from the field and we would
[1:01:36] take sand and we would take all and we
[1:01:38] would put it all over that barrel then
[1:01:39] we would take a rope and walk up and
[1:01:41] down that barrel getting the rust off of
[1:01:43] it so we're ready for the next fire
[1:01:45] mission hey don't go home lay your Bible
[1:01:50] up till next week be ready to fire one
[1:01:56] downrange at any time
[1:02:03] but I'll never forget was in the motor
[1:02:05] and when you did that that all you know
[1:02:07] come here would fly off you'd be covered
[1:02:09] in all and the captain came down we had
[1:02:13] a guy this guy did nothing you make a
[1:02:19] good Church remember somewhere I guess
[1:02:21] Oh his shoes you can see his stall the
[1:02:26] crease you could cut matter with it and
[1:02:29] he carried his handkerchief like this
[1:02:32] and the captain came down to the motor
[1:02:35] pool here we was covered in sand and all
[1:02:39] and here he was looking like he'd just
[1:02:41] come out of the dry cleaners and the
[1:02:45] captain gave him the day off because he
[1:02:48] looks at good you know I think that's
[1:02:51] the reason I got out of the army can I
[1:02:57] get an amen
[1:03:00] that's the way some people look at that
[1:03:02] Cup everything is just right in place
[1:03:04] but you know why cuz they ain't done
[1:03:06] nothing they never have to change their
[1:03:10] shirt after service
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:19] and I didn't come to be a spectator I
[1:03:23] come to be a participator that when I
[1:03:26] leave I want the devil to know I was
[1:03:29] here I want the devil to know I wanted
[1:03:31] to hear my voice I want to hear my man I
[1:03:35] wanted to hear my praise to God to fight
[1:03:47] the good fight of faith to be a chosen
[1:03:50] would be a soldier in the Army of God
[1:03:53] we're Christian soldiers you got to
[1:03:55] train to be brought up to know the
[1:03:57] techniques of the enemy how to fortify
[1:03:59] to know how to fight the fight I'm here
[1:04:02] to tell you this morning
[1:04:03] that's your current situation or your
[1:04:06] circumstance your current hardship your
[1:04:08] current trial may be a direct result of
[1:04:11] your placement in God's army because God
[1:04:17] will allow these things to mold us and
[1:04:20] shape us for the battle he wants to use
[1:04:23] us in I remember one time we was out in
[1:04:27] the field I was a 203 man I had a a
[1:04:29] grenade launcher a the name 16 you know
[1:04:31] I went to the rifle range brother Donnie
[1:04:33] tell you brother Daniel they've hunted
[1:04:35] with me no I went to the rifle range and
[1:04:38] fired off a few rounds and the drill
[1:04:40] sergeant Clem said you want to be the
[1:04:42] 203 man you're going to be the grenade
[1:04:43] launcher you'll have to be accurate you
[1:04:51] just have to be close
[1:04:57] so I turned it the whole town I was in
[1:05:00] the army
[1:05:00] I was a 203 man and I never forget one
[1:05:04] time the airforce boys come and pick
[1:05:05] this up brother use Air Force would they
[1:05:07] come and pick the stuff out of the field
[1:05:09] and put our guns up in the back of the
[1:05:10] c-130s I think this what they were
[1:05:12] anyway I was sitting there with my m16
[1:05:14] in my 203 and this Air Force guy he
[1:05:16] looked at me he said what in the world
[1:05:18] is that and I thought my god I'm in the
[1:05:21] wrong branch of service but God allowed
[1:05:30] things to come into your life to train
[1:05:32] you for the 203 to train you for the m16
[1:05:35] to train you for the one m198 the one
[1:05:38] five five pounder God will load you the
[1:05:40] way he wants to use you if God wants you
[1:05:45] to be a cook be the best cook if God
[1:05:47] wants you to be the supply man be the
[1:05:49] best supply man if God wants you to be a
[1:05:51] transporter try smart with everything
[1:05:53] within you but if God split you on the
[1:05:55] frontline fight with everything that is
[1:05:58] within you
[1:06:06] they men listen to me as the battle
[1:06:10] rages you become a real target the enemy
[1:06:16] has an arsenal of weapons he may try to
[1:06:19] keep you suppressed deep rest compressed
[1:06:23] or distressed but be encouraged in the
[1:06:31] midst of the fight be encouraged know
[1:06:33] that no matter what the devil throws at
[1:06:36] you remember what the Bible says the
[1:06:38] Bible says no weapon no weapon that's
[1:06:42] formed against me shall prosper
[1:06:48] hallelujah huh maybe a real target but I
[1:06:53] want the devil to know that we are real
[1:06:55] army we're not Boy Scouts were soldiers
[1:07:00] Satan's desire is for you his brother
[1:07:02] Donny preacher here a couple reasons not
[1:07:04] to go in his trophy room
[1:07:05] he won't your head in his trophy room he
[1:07:08] would love nothing more to take you down
[1:07:10] in battle and put your head on his wall
[1:07:12] I got this one with lust I got that one
[1:07:14] with this I got that one with that but I
[1:07:16] want the devil to know the bride that's
[1:07:18] got a trophy room also and we're gonna
[1:07:20] hang on a wall the devil of lust the
[1:07:23] devil of pride come on somebody
[1:07:25] the devil told me we're gonna burn my
[1:07:27] bow because when we leave here every
[1:07:30] devil will be under our feet
[1:07:36] [Applause]
[1:07:42] we already quit barmy God equips his
[1:07:47] army for the battle he's called them to
[1:07:49] fight the fees were 16 says finally my
[1:07:52] brethren be strong in the Lord and the
[1:07:54] power of his mind but on the whole
[1:07:57] armour of God she may be able to stand
[1:08:02] against the wiles of the devil but we
[1:08:05] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:08:06] against principalities against powers
[1:08:08] against the rulers of darkness of this
[1:08:10] world against spiritual wickedness in
[1:08:12] high places
[1:08:15] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:08:17] of God that you may beliefs and the evil
[1:08:20] day and having done all to stand stand
[1:08:24] therefore having your loins gird about
[1:08:28] with truth and having on the breastplate
[1:08:29] of righteousness and your feet shod with
[1:08:31] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:08:33] above all take the shield of faith
[1:08:35] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[1:08:37] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[1:08:38] take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:08:40] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[1:08:43] God and did he gives us one more weapon
[1:08:46] then I'm afraid we hardly ever really
[1:08:49] use verse 18 he gives us one weapon more
[1:08:55] praying always
[1:08:59] with all prayer and supplication in the
[1:09:02] spirit
[1:09:05] you see prayer is not a burden
[1:09:08] prayer is a weapon prayer is
[1:09:13] communication with your God the prophet
[1:09:20] of God said that prayer was more
[1:09:22] powerful than an atomic bomb they
[1:09:26] dropped the atomic bomb in Hiroshima -
[1:09:27] in World War two there were people you
[1:09:29] can look at the pictures they were
[1:09:31] people that disintegrated from the blast
[1:09:33] of that bomb the only thing left was the
[1:09:36] shadow on the sidewalk where they were
[1:09:38] standing and for years years children
[1:09:43] were born with 1012 fingers and 1 iron
[1:09:46] all kinds of birth defects born without
[1:09:49] brains born I'll console because of the
[1:09:52] effects of one bomb dropped on Hiroshima
[1:09:55] and the property God said your prayer is
[1:09:57] more powerful than an atomic bomb that a
[1:10:01] mother praying for her children long
[1:10:03] after she's gone and in the grave that
[1:10:05] prayer will suckle tear until that
[1:10:07] moment that it's needed a man
[1:10:12] some of y'all remember sister park god
[1:10:14] bless mr. Clark so oh you're talking
[1:10:17] about a warrior she was a warrior
[1:10:19] she was my Sunday school teacher when I
[1:10:21] was a little boy and I went to see her
[1:10:23] when she was sick went over the house me
[1:10:24] show after church one night I'll never
[1:10:26] forget what she told me hey my sister
[1:10:30] she was wonderful we've said that she
[1:10:33] said yeah it's what she'd always say
[1:10:35] yeah she said I prayed for you I always
[1:10:41] prayed for you so we just a little boy I
[1:10:43] seen that God had called you to preach
[1:10:48] she said even when you wasn't serving
[1:10:50] the Lord I pray for you
[1:10:54] he just made me cry out here when I was
[1:10:58] running up down the road like an idiot
[1:11:01] God for me
[1:11:07] you see prayer is not something that's
[1:11:10] one-sided I hate a conversation when you
[1:11:13] can never get a word in you know I'm
[1:11:17] talking back hey doing god bless you can
[1:11:20] see buddy I gotta go
[1:11:21] I never got say hello
[1:11:28] and that's the way we do God sometimes
[1:11:33] when I'm in a bit of a man jumping big
[1:11:41] the prayer it's not a checklist prayer
[1:11:47] is not a wish list it's a communication
[1:11:50] between you and the God who created you
[1:11:52] and you talk to God and then you give
[1:11:56] God a chance to talk back I know what I
[1:12:06] when I first started so loud I know it's
[1:12:08] silly but it wasn't silly at the time it
[1:12:10] was a real battle Satan attacked me that
[1:12:13] there was no God and I Restless I know
[1:12:16] there's a god but as wrassling it was so
[1:12:19] real I was actually my chest from
[1:12:21] grievin was physically sword I know it's
[1:12:24] silly thoughts silly I know it was it is
[1:12:26] now but it wasn't then it was a real
[1:12:28] battle I said god I know there's a god I
[1:12:31] know you're real if you would just speak
[1:12:33] to me and I opened the window and you
[1:12:39] know what I heard a bird a bird singing
[1:12:46] something said who do you reckon he's
[1:12:49] singing to
[1:12:57] it was gone it was gone Amen oh my what
[1:13:08] a man breaking the whole place
[1:13:12] prayer is a weapon notice there's no
[1:13:19] armor in the back because we are not to
[1:13:28] retreat
[1:13:29] we cannot flee from the devil because
[1:13:34] the word doesn't say that the word
[1:13:36] doesn't say we flee from the devil but
[1:13:38] what the word actually says is the devil
[1:13:41] flees from us there's no need to back up
[1:13:45] there's no need to turn around
[1:13:47] we're not the one that has to move he
[1:13:49] must move resist the devil and he will
[1:13:54] flee from you always moving forth
[1:13:58] endured hardship as a good soldier Paul
[1:14:02] said no man that Wars entangled himself
[1:14:04] in the affairs of life that he may
[1:14:06] please him who have chosen him to be a
[1:14:09] soldier that war means to do military
[1:14:11] duty to be on active service to be a
[1:14:15] soldier to fight no servant soldier when
[1:14:19] it's service gets entangled in the inner
[1:14:23] prices of civilian life his aim is to
[1:14:28] satisfy and to please the one who
[1:14:31] enlisted him the one who chose him
[1:14:36] anybody it's everything and I know those
[1:14:39] brothers has been in the military once
[1:14:40] ever been enlisted in the military it's
[1:14:42] familiar with the term civilian life
[1:14:47] when a man is listed in the military you
[1:14:50] find yourself in basic training I know
[1:14:57] I'm gonna bring back some bad memories
[1:14:58] for some of you home
[1:15:00] but you see what you're in basic
[1:15:03] training though certain expectations are
[1:15:06] required of you the commander-in-chief
[1:15:08] expects you to put off the old man
[1:15:14] you're no longer to act like a civilian
[1:15:18] because civilian is non-military
[1:15:22] I was 17 year old in boot camp at Fort
[1:15:26] Sill Oklahoma and I remember that night
[1:15:33] they got us off the blessing me March
[1:15:36] they put us in line and took us into
[1:15:38] this building we had to start taking off
[1:15:41] her clothes and putting them in boxes to
[1:15:42] ship home and started giving us all the
[1:15:46] same uniform and then they marched us
[1:15:51] over they marched us over to the barber
[1:15:59] and they set this boy down you know he's
[1:16:02] one of these pretty boys at the barber
[1:16:07] said how do you want your hair son
[1:16:11] he said just take a little bit off the
[1:16:13] side and kind of block it across the
[1:16:15] back it is that no problem he filled a
[1:16:28] pocket onion Seuss story said didn't
[1:16:38] bother me I didn't have much to lose but
[1:16:41] here we were all recruits but they
[1:16:53] turned us into soldiers by being taught
[1:16:56] to endure hardness the hardness that we
[1:17:01] endured in basic made of soldiers the
[1:17:05] officers instilled into us the Army's
[1:17:07] concept of discipline and obedience we
[1:17:10] endured hours of drilling endless
[1:17:12] parades nowrap marches constant pressure
[1:17:16] tasteless food guard duty without sleep
[1:17:19] bullying my sergeants lectures exposure
[1:17:25] to inclement weather the whole procedure
[1:17:28] was designed to toughen us up to make us
[1:17:32] ready from battle the Roman soldiers of
[1:17:35] Paul's day were the toughest and most
[1:17:37] disciplined and the most efficient
[1:17:39] soldiers in the world and Paul in his
[1:17:41] mind was reminded of that when he told
[1:17:43] Timothy he was a soldier of Jesus Christ
[1:17:45] he had been chosen
[1:17:47] picked up by God and he needed to learn
[1:17:50] to endure the hardness that a good
[1:17:52] soldier does he does not quit because he
[1:17:55] faces difficulty tasks or dangerous
[1:17:57] situations he knows that his life is
[1:17:59] expendable many a man has gave his life
[1:18:02] for his brother but jesus said no man
[1:18:05] has laid his life down oh yeah many a
[1:18:15] good man died on the battlefield saving
[1:18:17] his fellow soldiers knowing she must be
[1:18:22] prepared to lay your life down when it's
[1:18:24] required brother it's a little man wife
[1:18:25] these two sing a song it thrilled me
[1:18:27] goes something like this
[1:18:28] forgive me Lord and try me one more time
[1:18:30] I'll be yours if you'll be behind if I
[1:18:32] follow if I fell let me rise and try
[1:18:35] again forgive me Lord and try me one
[1:18:37] more time and the Prophet said I like
[1:18:39] that for eating good soldiers apt to get
[1:18:41] wounded or they're apt to get hurt buddy
[1:18:44] still a soldier it's got a purpose of
[1:18:47] something to fight for
[1:18:48] he'll rise and try again any soldier of
[1:18:51] the Cross will do the same thing and I
[1:18:53] say to you this morning maybe you've
[1:18:55] been shell-shocked
[1:18:56] maybe something in your life a
[1:18:58] shell-shocked you and you've got amnesia
[1:19:00] that you don't know where you came from
[1:19:02] and you don't know where you're going
[1:19:03] but listen to the words of brothers also
[1:19:06] listen to Mary say being under me look
[1:19:08] back into the word and see that God
[1:19:11] chose you for this army god bless you in
[1:19:13] his army remember who you are you may be
[1:19:18] a wounded soldier but you're still God's
[1:19:21] property rasa rasa let's fight again

[1:19:46] responsibility stay your post don't get
[1:19:51] caught up in the affairs of this world
[1:19:52] you have a mission you're here for a
[1:19:55] purpose
[1:19:59] Paul's instruction series that were
[1:20:01] known not to get caught up in the things
[1:20:02] that's secondary to our mission not to
[1:20:05] entangle ourselves with the affairs of
[1:20:07] this life were Warren
[1:20:08] we must not be distracted from the
[1:20:11] battle who not like the world

[1:20:50] of the cross you see Paul knew what can
[1:20:53] I have just a few more minutes Paul knew
[1:20:54] what it meant to endure hardships he
[1:20:56] said I found a good fight I kept the
[1:21:00] faith I kept the faith I was imprisoned
[1:21:03] but I kept the faith
[1:21:05] I was changed but I kept the faith I was
[1:21:09] told I was hungry I was beaten but I
[1:21:13] kept the faith
[1:21:14] I was rejected but I kept the faith

[1:21:33] faith I lost my job over one of the
[1:21:36] leads but I kept the faith I had great

[1:43:05] [Applause]
[1:43:09] he's the Lord Jesus oh yeah we're not
[1:43:14] wonderful hey man hey you know I could
[1:43:18] have read those same quotes and read
[1:43:20] those same scriptures but I didn't have
[1:43:23] them same experiences to tell by what he
[1:43:27] had to tell or brother Terry or brother
[1:43:30] Daniel or brother JD and the rest of
[1:43:32] here that was in the military so I would
[1:43:35] have preached it with all of my heart
[1:43:37] and I would have believed it all in the
[1:43:39] heart but the experience is that he told
[1:43:42] the Houser and the most of you was like
[1:43:44] me you didn't know if that was the house
[1:43:46] or if it was 155 or 203 that meant
[1:43:51] nothing to me did it took most of you
[1:43:54] that was non-military well you see
[1:43:57] whenever non message folks coming here
[1:43:59] us preach something they
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:10] and when we read the Bible and when we
[1:44:13] read the message we don't want to be
[1:44:15] detached from it right we want to know
[1:44:20] by experience when you're talking about
[1:44:22] the God of the Bible you're talking
[1:44:24] about my god you tell me that God in the
[1:44:27] message you're talking about my God
[1:44:29] because that's who I have an experience
[1:44:31] with him praise God
[1:44:33] thank you brother Darrell
[1:44:45] the Darrell had another sermon that he
[1:44:47] was telling me about that he was
[1:44:48] studying preparing for but his computer
[1:44:51] went haywire and crashed I mean I've had
[1:44:55] several of those events happen to me
[1:44:57] before that I studied in a certain
[1:44:59] direction and all of a sudden it just
[1:45:00] totally disappears off the screen and
[1:45:02] after you come to yourself and passing
[1:45:04] out then you saying what in the world
[1:45:06] I'm not going to preach but I've seen it
[1:45:09] so many times when everybody go this way
[1:45:12] or that will ever lint in cyberspace
[1:45:14] their sermons out there somewhere
[1:45:15] floating around wherever they went and
[1:45:18] then you go to regrouping and then you
[1:45:19] see the direction you know the Lord
[1:45:21] wanted so to me this is perfect was
[1:45:24] nothing
[1:45:33] probably every one of us need to get
[1:45:35] that thing that he was reading there at
[1:45:37] the end I'm a soldier all that and make
[1:45:39] it a part of who we are nearly every day
[1:45:41] of our life don't Lee hey man god bless
[1:45:44] you so much so enjoy the service today
[1:45:46] we're gonna pray again before we let you
[1:45:48] go we've got a one of our brother
[1:45:50] soldiers that's in the hospital today
[1:45:52] down in Georgia brother Randy gets a man
[1:45:55] who's been really sick very been gone
[1:45:57] through some real difficult times and
[1:45:59] sister Sharon had to take him into the
[1:46:01] hospital yesterday sodium really really
[1:46:03] low brought it up and he's doing better
[1:46:07] but they're gonna keep him again
[1:46:08] overnight tonight we want to just pray
[1:46:11] for our brother before we go anybody
[1:46:13] else with that something you'd like to
[1:46:14] just raise your hand lifers to pray for
[1:46:16] you before we go all right god bless you
[1:46:19] let's just hold these these needs and
[1:46:21] request in our hearts Heavenly Father
[1:46:24] how we thank you so much today for this
[1:46:27] great word Lord Jesus thank you for such
[1:46:32] encouraging wonderful things truly Lord
[1:46:36] for the most of us that have not been in
[1:46:39] the military we can only relate because
[1:46:41] of an uncle or someone else that we knew
[1:46:43] and the stories that they have told us
[1:46:46] and Lord our group of young people this
[1:46:50] week have journeyed to one of the
[1:46:52] concentration camps and then to Normandy
[1:46:55] maybe yesterday today or something like
[1:46:57] that and for a lot of them they had
[1:47:00] loved ones maybe that was there but yet
[1:47:03] fathers we hear these things today
[1:47:06] we've never been for the most part most
[1:47:08] of us been into the military service
[1:47:10] we're grateful for those who have but
[1:47:13] we're grateful father that we've been in
[1:47:15] the service of the Greek king for that's
[1:47:18] truly a better service than the Air
[1:47:19] Force the army the National Guard
[1:47:22] whatever more we're grateful for each of
[1:47:24] those it sacrificed but father we pray
[1:47:27] that you would help us that we can be
[1:47:29] able to do that I mean we realize Lord
[1:47:32] that we're not our own you chose us to
[1:47:35] be soldiers in the army of God so
[1:47:38] therefore we cannot quit we cannot turn
[1:47:40] back we cannot do as we wish
[1:47:43] we are your people father we pray for
[1:47:46] brother Randy today in the hospital Lord
[1:47:48] Jesus that should move for our brother
[1:47:50] in the name of Jesus while we're praying
[1:47:53] right now made the hand of God reach
[1:47:55] down and touch our brother there in the
[1:47:57] hospital in Georgia you see Lord what
[1:48:00] he's been going through and we're just
[1:48:01] asking you Father not for a touch but
[1:48:05] Lord for a complete deliverance father
[1:48:08] you say sister Sharon has been really
[1:48:10] difficult for her and Lord I'm asking
[1:48:13] you that should move for her as well
[1:48:14] today I'm sure Lord is family standing
[1:48:17] here they're certainly concerned about
[1:48:19] the situation we know that Satan may
