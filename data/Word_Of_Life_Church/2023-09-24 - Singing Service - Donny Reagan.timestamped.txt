[26:26] foreign
[26:32] [Music]
[26:48] [Music]
[26:52] keep this in mind
[26:55] when hope
[26:57] seems so hard to find but surely

[27:11] and when the whole world has let you
[27:15] down
[27:17] [Music]
[27:18] Jesus he can still be found when you've
[27:23] tried
[27:25] it all
[27:27] Look to Him
[27:35] [Music]
[27:41] makes lonely
[27:44] all the days
[27:46] [Music]
[27:58] for midnight and he can come back
[28:06] so
[28:08] how will it end Look to Him
[28:17] Now I know
[28:20] that questions care
[28:23] they can get so hard to understand
[28:28] but then

[28:36] and he knows it all
[28:39] as I see even that little Sparrow fall
[28:44] and he can hold bad
[28:48] sees with just one hand

[38:48] so grateful to stand here tonight with

[39:36] Saul and Lord he played that when evil
[39:40] spirits would leave

[40:03] one more good hand clap of Praise in
[40:05] Jesus name
[40:07] amen Stephen
[40:10] amen you can be seated for a minute I
[40:13] have prayed over songs and prayed over
[40:15] songs and mother Donnie said let's
[40:17] preach I said well just let me sing and
[40:19] you preach and then I got win somebody
[40:20] said he mentioned a couple of weeks ago
[40:23] well my brother Tim said wants him to
[40:27] preach and he wanted me to preach and we
[40:29] went back and forth he said well we'll
[40:30] just see who wins the battle
[40:33] well I won the battle
[40:36] so but I I told him I'd really rather
[40:39] for him to speak in the morning because
[40:41] I just believe there's something to be
[40:43] said that God could do and but we
[40:46] appreciate the opportunity to be here
[40:48] today and sing a few songs for you in
[40:50] worship worship is a powerful thing
[40:54] John Calvin makes a statement
[40:57] he said when music and worship becomes
[41:00] just music and worship
[41:02] he said we've lost the effect of it
[41:05] we have all of these music and all this
[41:08] what they call gospel music and whatever
[41:11] they want to call it
[41:13] what have they done they've lost the
[41:15] effect of what it's for
[41:17] it's where you can take and open and a
[41:19] door will open
[41:21] and a door opens and you walk in the
[41:24] door where are you walking to into the
[41:26] presence
[41:27] of the king of kings
[41:30] what's amazing is when he holds out the
[41:32] golden Sepulcher as he did in this
[41:35] Esther
[41:36] and that's what we're here for tonight
[41:37] because it's powerful
[41:40] don't don't let Satan cheat you out of a
[41:42] blessing
[41:44] if you need something you say but if the
[41:46] word ain't coming forth I can't get in
[41:48] that no yes you can
[41:50] I've heard the prophet say he got it in
[41:52] JCPenney's parking lot
[41:54] you can get it anywhere you want it
[41:56] whatever you need
[41:58] you believe that
[42:00] brother Paul told me that he has been
[42:02] praying he's come expecting if we've all
[42:05] come like brother Paul told me
[42:08] the Rapture just may take place tonight
[42:12] it's very possible
[42:14] so we're looking for a good time and I
[42:16] prayed over songs that the right song
[42:19] Would Be Sung not just to get up here
[42:21] and be heard that's why I told brother
[42:23] Donnie I said I'm not one to come and
[42:26] take over a service I tried my best to
[42:29] get out of this
[42:31] I told him in there I ain't telling you
[42:33] I'm coming no more
[42:36] I'm just going to sneak in the back door
[42:37] and then one sister said well if you do
[42:40] that somebody's going to see you and
[42:42] they're going to come run and then
[42:43] brother Paul said you have to put a bag
[42:45] over your head
[42:47] so have you ever see somebody come
[42:50] through with a bag with their head you
[42:52] know it's Tim Burdette
[42:54] so we can't use that now brother Paul
[42:57] but it's good to be here ain't it amen
[42:59] let me get back here
[43:31] foreign

[51:31] but I think I know it
[51:33] you had to put me in the right leg
[51:38] you know it's tough
[51:41] so glad to be here with y'all again
[51:44] his uh
[51:48] it's hard when I have to read off of
[51:49] something it's easier when I can just
[51:51] learn the song and get up there and just
[51:52] let it froze by Donnie but
[51:55] I started to do this song here last time
[51:58] and I didn't do it and
[52:00] but I do love this song we saw second
[52:02] birth
[52:03] of uh some of you may have heard it
[52:05] before
[52:07] I've had a birth that I can't remember
[52:09] and I've had one that I can't forget
[52:12] but I that's pretty much what it's
[52:14] saying
[52:16] and it's it's a real good song
[52:19] and it's tough
[52:21] I play drums at our church
[52:24] and
[52:25] if I knew the brother here was going to
[52:27] be here I'd have him take this but I
[52:30] come in and I just rearranged his drums
[52:32] for you
[52:34] I'm sorry brother I made the throne a
[52:37] little higher but he's a little taller
[52:38] than I am as you can tell but
[52:41] I do love the Lord I know you love the
[52:43] Lord and we're such a blessed people
[52:46] I've been so blessed I really have more
[52:50] than I deserve through through my life
[52:52] he's done things for me that
[52:54] that
[52:56] couldn't be done without Christ and I
[52:59] thank him for that but we're going to do
[53:01] this song for you and you know any song
[53:02] we do you're welcome to we're all
[53:05] singers for Christ so you're welcome to
[53:07] join in
[53:13] let's see
[53:15] this is why I don't like reading off a
[53:17] paper
[53:17] [Music]
[53:20] when I came into this old world
[53:25] I just can't recall
[53:29] I don't remember anything
[53:33] about my birth at all
[53:39] but on
[53:41] [Music]
[53:43] in prayer I never will regret I've had a
[53:48] birth I can't remember
[53:52] one I can won't forget
[53:56] oh and to this world it makes no
[54:01] difference
[54:02] some may even frown wrong but the angels
[54:08] all rejoice when my name was written
[54:13] down unworthy
[54:16] of his Mercy but still he paid my debt
[54:22] I've had a birth I can't remember
[54:27] and one I can't forget
[54:32] listen to this it never made the paper
[54:37] never made the evening news
[54:42] when I took off the old man and Christ
[54:47] put on the news
[54:50] all of my sins were cast into the sea of
[54:55] forgetfulness as far as the East is from
[54:58] the West I've had a bird I can't
[55:02] remember
[55:04] one I'll never
[55:08] oh and to this world it makes no
[55:13] difference
[55:17] [Music]
[55:21] when my name was written down
[55:27] Unworthy of his Mercy but still he paid
[55:33] my debt I've had a bird I can't remember
[55:39] and one I came prepared
[55:44] now it never made the paper it didn't
[55:49] make the evening news
[55:54] when I put down your mind and Christ put
[55:59] on the news
[56:02] and all of our sins were cast into the
[56:06] sea of the Saints as far as the yeast is
[56:09] from the West I happy birth I can't
[56:14] remember
[56:16] and one that I can't forget
[56:20] oh into this world it makes no
[56:25] difference
[56:26] some may even proud but the angels all
[56:32] rejoice when my name was written down so
[56:39] Unworthy of his Mercy keep it
[56:44] my death I've had a bird I can't
[56:49] remember
[56:50] and one I can't forget
[56:56] to this world it makes no difference
[57:01] some may even proud
[57:05] but the angels all rejoice when my name
[57:10] was
[57:16] Mercy but still he paid my debt I had a
[57:22] birth I can't remember
[57:25] and one I can't forget
[57:30] I've had a birth I can't remember
[57:35] and one I can't forget

[1:15:04] stairs

[1:15:10] here
[1:15:11] oh my
[1:15:13] Satan come by Brother Harry
[1:15:16] and there in the garden where everything
[1:15:19] was fell there
[1:15:23] we know that it goes back to the
[1:15:25] rightful owner the abstract deed but
[1:15:28] Satan now Takes Over Control of the
[1:15:30] garden
[1:15:31] because of the sin
[1:15:34] the prophet of God said he goes by and
[1:15:35] he picks up all these you know it was in
[1:15:37] seed time of course at that time brother
[1:15:39] Harry and he goes down and he places
[1:15:40] them in in pawn shops
[1:15:45] and you're hanging there I don't know
[1:15:47] about y'all but I love pawn shops
[1:15:50] and one day Jesus comes in
[1:15:52] Brother Don he walks by and he says
[1:15:55] that looks just like mine
[1:16:02] he says where'd you get that
[1:16:05] somebody brought it in and sold it to me
[1:16:07] I just took it
[1:16:10] he walks on Down the Line he's going in
[1:16:12] and out of the aisles
[1:16:14] because when I go in them I walk down
[1:16:16] this way and I walk up this way and I
[1:16:17] walk every aisle just to see if there's
[1:16:19] anything I'm interested in
[1:16:21] Jesus just walks on down Brother Louie
[1:16:24] goodness
[1:16:26] there's Brother Louie
[1:16:29] he turns the corner and begins to come
[1:16:31] back and he says oh my goodness
[1:16:33] there's brother Donnie
[1:16:35] where did you get him somebody just come
[1:16:38] in and I took him
[1:16:40] he says they're mine
[1:16:44] well you've got to pay me I've done paid
[1:16:46] the price for him amen
[1:16:49] he had to pay it and he paid it back it
[1:16:53] before time ever came in order for it he
[1:16:56] paid it down Calvary for sure but it was
[1:16:58] already paid before that
[1:17:00] why because I was in his mind so he goes
[1:17:03] down the aisle and he pulls Harry off
[1:17:05] and he pulls Louie off and he pulls this
[1:17:07] one off and he pulls Tony off and he
[1:17:09] pulls this and he said I'm taking them
