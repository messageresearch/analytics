this out why aren't you doing this why aren't you doing this he he knows what he's doing this say he's never been late when Lazarus died he wasn't late but I'm gonna speak on something tonight we'll get right into it I've had some text and people telling me this week that they're praying for me and I'll take all I can get I've never been back there one single time by the Terry that I haven't wanted to run out that back door you have know you've never felt nothing like that in your life until you've been truly called to me is a true call it's it's not wanting to do it because God knows in my heart i I would rather be sitting there and I might have told y'all this side I remember the first time I touched the brother Don he about preaching I sent him an email and I called him on the phone and he was talking on the phone he said well you want to take Wednesday night service I said no I said I'll get back to you and I remember the email I sent him I found it the other day it was in 2006 and my first sermon was in 2009 so I got back with him in about three years so I didn't rush into this took a lot of sleepless nights and a lot of praying and a lot of tests and trials and you know we don't understand the path that God has for us but you know if you feel the leading of God in your life for anything not just preaching but anything you know when you get to question the Lord is is this is this you listen to the word when I finally did it brother brother Eddie biscuit was up here preaching I was sitting we had a chair sitting up from the sound booth and I don't even everybody preached on the only words that I remember that entire service was he pointed at me and said if God's calling you to preach you better preach [Music] so I'm gonna chop it up again the night brother JimBob says you can't eat it unless it's chopped up so we're gonna chop it up if you got your Bibles we'll get right to it Romans Murray two scriptures and then we'll be seated Romans 8:14 and then we're gonna read in John 1:12 thank you I'm gonna actually pick my sermon up tonight we're brother Donnie left off Wednesday night you know by the Terry sometimes you're wanting confirmation on a sermon that you got prepared and and you're praying about it you know Lord is this what you want me to bring and very into his sermon he he got into mind and and I didn't do these notes I've had these notes for over a year so we're gonna he taught brother Donnie was talking about the bride's position whereas your position as a bride and we're going to look at that and we're going to that and what is your possessions the possessions as an heir as joint heirs of the Christ if you come to be the bride you're claiming to be a joint heir with Christ so there's so many things that belong to you so many things that belong to you and tonight and I hope we can we can get a grasp for that tonight what what God has for us I really believe with all my heart we leave so much stuff laying around that God has for us that we didn't were not picking up so if we can Romans 8:14 or we down through chapters time verse 17 for as many were led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if it so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together and John one will reject by verse 12 and 13 but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which are which are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of a man but of God and in that verses 12 there when it says them that believe on his name that's not like the Baptist method and will you believe on his name and then you're set for life there's everything that comes after that which are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God let's pray over the word Heavenly Father we thank you Father for this opportunity Lord I pray father that you would help me tonight to get out of the way Lord there's so many things Lord that we no doubt battle through the week through the day Lord we can't redo that we can't undo that Lord it's already done but Lord there's what lies ahead of us Lord as human beings as sons and daughters Lord we can trust in you for everything from this point on Lord that you will take care of us to help us tonight Lord as you brought together here tonight to receive food for the journey Lord Lord I could give it to them as far as these words that I've got here these scriptures these quotes but Lord that's all it would be it would be words of knowledge of my my knowledge of what I wrote down what I perceive the scripture to be what I perceive this coach to be Lord but Lord if you would come and anoint it if you would sit me down Lord and you would take over and reveal to them Lord we could preach this whole sermon and every single person in here would get something different for it to meet their need Lord I pray that you would anoint the people Lord we welcome you here tonight Lord this is your time the days over we've had our time through the day Lord but I pray father that we give light on your time right now we thank you for Jesus name Amen you may be seated in Romans 8:14 and it talks about being a joint heir with Christ now look up the definition of what is a heir a person legally entitled to the property or rank of another on that person's death somebody had to die for you to be who you are to get what you get to possess what you get somebody had to die but somebody had to live to be good join there somebody had to live you can't be a joint heir with somebody unless they're alive so everything that Christ had everything that was given to him of God everything he possessed all the power that he had he died when he died that blood was shed so that you could have that too and the part where Satan missed out was when he rose again and he did he didn't take it back from me he didn't say well psyche I'm not I'm not really dead I'm alive now you give it back he said I'll share that with you then join heirs with Christ so brother Branham says in the God who is rich in mercy now we are a part of God you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking your very name if it was ever was in the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were but Branham says I'm not he says I'm only saying that's not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from that from this fear and this scare that you don't know who you are you're not going to be but you now you now are sons of God see you always were sons of God so we identify ourselves sin of who we are is is natural people you know your natural name who you are your some of you are our husbands your brother's your uncle's your wives your sisters your aunt's your mom's your dad's that's your natural identity here on earth you you can say yeah I Know Who I am I'm Gary here son that's that's who I am Benny what God wants you to recognize God wants you to recognize who you are in him if you can't recognize who you are in him then the cross was in vain to you it was in vain you don't recognize that you're a joint heir you don't recognize what Christ done for you you don't recognize what belongs to you so how does what God wants us to see how we are in him you know we can go on say we're bride you know you can you can say I'm bride i'm identified in this message i'm a part of this message and after a while that's for years years that's always say I'm in the message I'm in the message on the message there's a lot of people there's a lot of people in this message that'll never go through them pearly gates that's sitting in these churches and that's the only thing when they go the grave that will be the only thing they take with him related to this message was they said in a message church that's all they'll take because they never had a full revelation of who they were you can say I'm bright brother branham you said but you people used to say that brother Branham would said when the bride recognized who she is she'll go you know I don't think he preached that in 63 in mystery of God revealed it becomes a cliche anymore you know we say that we say that when the bride recognizes who she is she'll leave we're still here I don't dampen my faith in Ian who I am if this goes on for another ten years 20 years if I'm still alive not absolutely believe I'm going interruption I don't believe I'll go the way of the grave i I don't I believe that I'm gonna be in the rapture I believe I am the rapture so you if you believe that you're not going without me and it ain't because I went to this church it's not because I believe this message it's because of Who I am it's because what what God made me to be [Music] in the future home if you are the bride the bride is part of the husband the only place you'll recognize is recognized what part of that husband that word you are and you can't recognize being the bride how he says how many sees that you get a bride come up here a bride comes up here and doesn't wedding if all she gets out of that there's a nice fancy dress she thinks she looks good and all the pomp and circumstance that goes with it and she never realizes who she is at that point she takes on that name she takes on everything that comes with that name if he's a millionaire oh yeah I don't know if you all understand the state of Tennessee what mutual law is mutual law is when you're married what's yours is hers whether her names on it or not that's mutual law that is that gets recognized in the state of Tennessee we've had people come filed reports men come filed a report that his wife stole his car are you married yeah we're not living together it don't matter it don't matter what's hers is yours what's yours is hers and that's the part of a bride this last day recognize that what's his is yours you know you we come in here we come in here on Wednesdays and Saturdays and Sundays and we and we take on the word we get dressed putting on the wedding garment and if you just sit down sit there and put on that garment the weekend a week out and that's all you do is put on the garment just listen then you get up and walk out you know I see people all the time as soon as the preaching let's stand they trying to walk out where's the worship where's the praise of being the bride he's dressing you and that's all you you get out of it was okay I got I got the sleeves put on today and out the door you go where's the worship you know and we'll get into it later in possessing every every time Israel moved further into the land of Canaan each city they possessed how did they finish their victory with praise and worship and this that's part of being the bride listen whoo you know I'm not at whoa I'm not a woman but if I was a woman and I was marrying the man of my dreams and Wayne laughing at me if I was a woman and I was marrying the man of my dreams and I felt it was kosher I'd be shouting and jumping and you know I mean if that's the way it is this is your dream this is what you dreamed of your whole life it's recognizing who you are but not only recognizing who you are as a bride recognizing your position in the bride everybody's got a position his brother Donny was saying tonight you know everybody's different if everybody's position everybody can't have the same position I trade positions with any one of you right now but everybody has a position and when you try to fulfill somebody else's position everything goes sideways you ever heard that saying nobody wants to be nobody everybody wants to be somebody but be yourself because everybody's taken be yourself don't be nobody else don't try to fulfill my position in the bride if you want to help somebody along the way be who you are in your position you'll be a greater blessing being who you are than trying to be somebody else we all can agree that we're members of the bride we can all say yeah members of the bride but I can't I can't tell you what your position is it's not enough to know God does God know you does God recognize you is it right in your position Satan's job he's not going to tell you this word and I might've spoken this before I think I've preached the message here and a half two years ago on who are you man I've gotten messages off of that this is one of them say he's not gonna tell you this message is wrong he would never convince you that for nothing he would never convince you that this is wrong but his job is keep you from seeing yourself in this his job is to keep you from seeing who you are what is yours what belongs to you he'll do his best to keep from getting you are getting a true revelation of what lies within you what kind of power that you have in you do we really realize but Terry what we have as sons and daughters of God now this is not you can't say well I'm in the message you know I had a a guy come to to me many years ago I was talking about it somebody yesterday that some guy in the message and went and told somebody that you had to be in the message to go to heaven to bit to believe what we believe to go to heaven he said I told him right then I said absolutely not absolutely not you have as many times brother Donny hit that the last year it's not your for no more you know as your position in the bride you're to be a light to others but is your life being too light to others that don't mean nobody else that don't see your lights not gonna go that's your power that's your position in the bride do you recognize what you have but Bram says in thy house this is one of my most favorite quotes that he says we're here you're talking about Jupiter and Mars and these stars that you see now well think about a 186,000 miles per second 186,000 miles per second take 120 million years by one second 186,000 break it down to 120 million years then what you got that's miles he says that and now then beyond that there's just as many moons and stars and he holds them with the power of his own word and that very same thing that holds them is in you as a Christian if you ever get a revelation of that part of the power that's in you there shouldn't be anything out there that you that God says is your possession take your possessions but you shouldn't be getting how could you not that this quote right here is a revelation it has to be a revelation and I believe that we don't have regulations that we live so far beneath what God has for us because we don't have a real revelation of the power of God in our lives now I don't mean you're gonna walk around go through a hospital and raise if everybody out of bed it's not that it's the power like was the brother Homer preaching about power of creating her brother Dara one of them creating that atmosphere the people know who you are people know when they get around you what kind of person you are we have to see the power that we have in us we're going to read in Leviticus I'm going to start getting into now in the possessions the children is in Leviticus 20 24 but I have said unto you you shall inherit that their land and I will give it unto you to possess their land that floweth with milk and honey I am the Lord your God which has separated you from other people they were different they were a different people and as time went on they they fail to recognize that the children of Israel lost a glimpse of who they really were of the God that was with him when they come out of Egypt and they the ones that went into the land they seemed there they seemed their family members died off they see God slay them in the wilderness and yet when they went into the land and God told him this is the land that you're going to inherit and the deeper they went in it the more lakhs they got and they were different they failed to get a revelation of who they were verse 25 and you you shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean and between unclean fouls and clean and you shall not make your souls of not abominable by beasts by foul or any manner of living thing that creepeth keepeth on the ground which I have separated from you is unclean you shall be holy unto me for I am the Lord Lord am holy and have Cert severed you from other people that you should be mine severed means I've divided you I pulled you out I pulled you aside you're a different people you have a different power of within you you have a different attitude you have a different atmosphere have different possessions everything in your life should be different it's a shame in that it took a Gentile a Gentile woman recognized who they were Rea have recognized who they were she knew who they were she said we know that the Lord she knew who the Lord was that she never she had they served graven images and everything else but she said the Lord have given you our land she knew who they were she knew that God had given them a possession God has taken our possession and giving it to you and only a few ever ever got the glimpse of who they were as I see said people see who you are people see what you possess you know I'm not talking about earthly possessions I'm not you know just because somebody's got a lot of money got a lot of things that people say well God's really blessed them no maybe maybe they're a hard worker maybe maybe they had a rich uncle you know it's not it's not that they're serving God better than you you know son some people's lives you know through their whole life if you get older I mean you're getting older brother Terry I seen the 2017 Happy Valley Church Youth picture back there on brother Donny and me and brother Terry wasn't in it but you see people that through life their whole life their generation next generation you see that they struggle they struggle financially is a struggle physically they struggle with sickness in it you think well you know wow maybe maybe you know they're done something wrong with their life that's just there a lot in life everyone is different exodus 20:3 a little bit a little I will drive them out this is God saying I'm giving you this land all the way back in Abraham I was I was reading in Genesis this week where God said area as the dust of the of the ground so your seed shall be in this land this is your land he taken there into hedron and he said this is all yours as far as you can see it's all yours and that this is what he's telling the children of Israel 400 years later when he brings them out little by little I'll Drive them out before thee and unto thee until thou be increased and inherit the land I will set thy bounds we're gonna get into this later I will set that boundaries from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines from the desert to the river for I will deliver then happiness of the land into your hand and you shall drive them out before thee thou shall make no covenant with them northern gods they shall not dwell in thy land we're going to talk about that again in a minute they shall not dwell in thy land the hating taking it yet but God's calling it there's the head knee and taking a knee step a foot on it and God says this is your land so in other words everybody else's trespassers so everything else that you claim is yours that's God's giving you if you claimed your healing you got cancer on that cancer is trespassing on what's yours if you got depression joy and peace is yours depressions trespassing on that so God said move these boundaries move these boundaries on the other side of that take this piece take this joy set a boundary on the other side of that that's yours push it as far as you want all the way to the Red Sea thou shalt not dwell in Isle a unless they'll make less they make these sin against me for if thou serve their gods it shall burn this shall surely be a snare unto them so God tells him to push him out I know I've got a few quotes of scriptures here early but I'll lessen it up here in a minute Jehovah Jireh in the 64 you don't know what you you own till you go looking through the Bible to find out the promises he's talking about your possessions they'll keep you from them if they can but they're yours every promise is to Abraham and to his seed after him every divine promise in the word belongs to Abraham and his seed and you are an heir to it there's that word again you're an heir to it says an heir oh my I like to look through to see what I got if somebody give me something I like to look it over I like to look through the Bible and see what belongs to me every seed of Abraham ought to do that when you become born-again feel with the Spirit of God and the Holy Spirit upon you you're an heir to every one of those promises promises become your possessions once you recognize who you are do you don't know you own something you can't possess it yet you can't you know that you're rich honking can will a million dollars to you and if you don't realize that he's your rich uncle you'll never possess it it'll never be yours it'll lay there and probate or whatever it does for and until you realize who you are so every promise in God's Word belongs to you and Satan's job is keep you from seeing that like I said he's not gonna make you believe you're not a senator of daughter of God but he'll keep you from taking what's yours he'll keep your healing from you your deliverance from you everything everything that your financial needs your lost son your lost daughter you lost husband he's going to just discourage you to even think that there's anything to be done I heard a story the other day this guy says he's going down the road and he looks over and sees Satan has a yard sale going on he said so he decides he just stopped in there and see what he's got he says say well what do you got for sale over here he said well I got a lot of things he said but discouragement is my best seller and so he says why why do you sell so much of that he said once I sell discouragement all my other tools work so his job it is to sell you discouragement as a son and daughter of God you're not allowed to possess that that's a genocide God said push him out he told Israel to push the Jebusites out but let we let it linger there and so many times Satan tries to get us to believe that we can live with it that's what got Israel in trouble and that's what got news roll in trouble to this day he told them you push them to these boundaries and you fit your boundaries over at the Red Sea you set them over to see if the desert the sea of the Philistines you set them on the other side of the desert these are your boundaries you push him all the way past there well they got the Jebusites to one spot and they decided to let him stay and they got to thinking amongst themselves you know what they say they're bad this is not that bad at all we can live with this that's still Satan's tactic to this day he's got a jebby sack called a pill there's times you see people never people that have been suffered and complained with things for years and years you never see him up here one time to get prayed for complaining about how sick they are complaining about how depressed they are how much they hurt and they're popping pills like a junkie what about your possession of healing that God said when you're in the land this is yours and there you are pop and Jeff decides I'm not nothing that gets medication but when that becomes your only source of healing you've built a house for the Jebusites [Applause] that's not doctrine that just Joe's opinion and Joshua 23-8 but Cleveland to the Lord your God as you have done this day for the LORD hath driven them out before you before you great nations and strong but as for you he's telling this is this is what you're going to be able to do as sons and daughters of God but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you and to this day nobody has stood before you they would have had no trouble driving the Jebusites out zero trouble all they had to do is trust God God already said this is your land they're trespassing one man of you shall chase a thousand for the Lord your God it is he that findeth for you as he hath promised you take good heed therefore unto you and to yourselves that you love the Lord your God so instead of possessing healing deliverance salvation for your loved ones Satan's handing over sadness bitterness depression doubt worry stress you can't have all the other stuff if you if you own that what happened was the Jebusites planted corn on their property so they they weren't able to so she don't nothing so they had to live with what with all the being short of what God taught them they could have in Exodus 23 says else if you do in anywise go back and cleave into the remnant of those nations even those that remain among you and she'll make marriages with them and go into them and they - you know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you they shall be snares and traps unto you and they are to this day naturally speaking in Israel and scourges in your side and thorns in your eyes until you perish from off this good land which the LORD hath given you the Joshua 15 as for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem the children of Judah could not drive them out but the Jebusites 12 were the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day Joshua was 17 yet the children Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities but the Canaanites would dwell in that land yet it came to pass when the children of Israel wax and strong that they put the Canaanites to tribute they put him to tribute and what God said do God said drive them out you're settling you're settling for something Satan's giving you and you're decided to live with it if I don't think about it I just leave it alone go about my business I won't worry about it God said drive it out and the children of Benjamin Joshua was the judges 121 and the tuner of bisman did not drive out to Jimmy sites that inhabited Jerusalem but the Jim jb sites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day in possessing all things oh my how I like that believers promise you say what's that got to do with us to every believer the believers promises eternal life the believers promises life it's joy its peace long-suffering gentleness patience fruits of the spirit divine human a dozen things I've wrote down here nearly that is your possession it belongs to you but you cannot have it until you fight for it it's yours Israel gave up the fight they gave up fighting they decide to didn't want to fight no more it really wasn't much of a fight God said you I'll be with you I'll Drive them out for you so why do they get tired why do they settle we do that life there's so much things that God has for us and we decided to settle without it I believe with all my heart that this bride will obtain every single position God has for Bob time she gets out of here it's yours God's not saving some of these possessions for another day he said everything that God was he poured into Christ everything Christ that was he poured back into his bride he didn't leave a little something out but we settled so far beneath what God has for so many times and we wonder why we struggle in our daily walk you know it's human nature it's this you're gonna leave this Humanity on I'm not saying that you need to go home and work yourself up into deity not bad at all God God knows you're human God knows you're gonna make mistakes God knows you're gonna fall but God also knows your heart he also knows you desire if it's your desire true desire to obtain ever ever position that God has for you you're going to do it you're going to do it the bride will do it so claim claim your ground click claim your land you know footsteps in position I don't hardly study anything like this without thing talking about Caleb you're talking about his Gentile dog promised wouldn't even to hint to him at all he says y'all don't want it I'll take it you don't want to take your promise that God gave you I'll take it you know give me my Mountain look at the part that he took I think I dressed that climbing your mountains no comment you know he he took hedron the most treacherous mountainous part therein in Canaan took a sword and fought and killed the Giants off of it 85 years old you know we've got no excuses somebody forgot to tell Caleb it didn't belong to him you know we look at that gives it God give us let's start with the Holy Ghost to me I think as a bride that's one of the first thing God gives give this brother he's the Holy Ghost and it's a free gift you got people seeing that people are struggling for years for the Holy Ghost I've been struggling struggling struct node you're not struggling you shouldn't be struggling for the Holy Ghost it's a free gift my son asked me to not if I'm going to use the Oreo we had a young people's meeting one time there was a young man there if he's here tonight or not but the John Horhn you act some of us but there's a lot of question and answers but Terry I think you remember a lot of the young people did question the answers and brother Donnie wanted some of the help ministers here to have meetings with both brother Weber and hanging brother Bradley about the horny act and answer some of these and I took the Holy Ghost subject and there's one boy he really liked Oreos so I told him I said it's this simple if you want to Oreo and you know there's Oreos in the pantry what do you do you go get them and eat them it's that simple the Holy Ghost is a free gift you don't have to work it up you don't have to get get beat on the back speak in tongues it's a free gift God did not say work for it when Christmas comes around all them gifts under the tree the days your wife asks you to do four hundred push-ups for you open yours it's not it's not that he's got your name on it so you go get it in question answers in 59 before there was a world you were in God stop it in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew you'd be wanting it you imagine before foundation of the world but Jerry God looked down through time and see brother he's gonna want the Holy Ghost I'm gonna have it all ready for him it's gonna be there waiting for him when he gets there it's a free gift God knew what your desire would be God knew that you would want to live for him God knew that she wanted to live a clean holy life and for you to walk in the footsteps of deity he said you've got to have this you've got to have the Holy Ghost so I want to have it there waiting for you so why did he do that well brand him also e-type to Egypt Israel coming out of Egypt in the Canaan Egypt is the world Canaan as the Holy Ghost you know that was his his type of that it was God he'd give it to them give it to him that's how easy it was when they first crossed Jordan and went into Canaan and they were slaying people left and right it was easy because God gave it to him why why did he give it to him it was a promise he made Abraham it wasn't because they were ever ham see why why does he give you what he gives you it's because of who you are it ain't it's not because of anything you done if my kids want something if I'm able if I'm able within reason if I'm able I'm gonna get it for him why because they're mine they're my kids the things that you want in life the things that God the blessings that God gives you in life you did not one single thing to deserve that you didn't do anything I've give my kids stuff but they didn't deserve there's times I I could have stomped a mud hole in them but they're mine and I love them anyway so I'm going to give them stuff what if God judges you by every mistake that you made what if God judged you I'm going to give you your possessions based on your mistakes you would have anything you would have nothing you don't deserve anything to begin with we don't deserve anything but it's because of who you are joint heirs with Christ whatever Christ was was it belongs to you it's because of who we are that's why he gives us the Holy Ghost I was studying this I was wondering you know God looking at who we are us looking at who we are the people looking at who we are what a Satan see when he sees you what is the devil see does he know who you are remember the sons of secrets even x19 they were trying to cast out Devils in Jesus name in Paul's name they said Jesus we know Paul we know but who are you so when you when you get down to pray when you go through your walk of life and you're trying to Satan I'm claiming this I'm claiming this does he know who you are does he know what you're claiming or does he just tell you I don't know who you are and you ain't taking it it's going to be impossible for you to for Satan to recognize who we are if we can't recognize who we ourselves you don't if you don't know you're the bride you're never gonna walk down that aisle if you claim to be the bride the bride don't recognize who she is music starts playing if she don't know she's the bride she's never coming through them doors no matter what she's got on no matter who stand up here waiting it's recognizing who you are you said brother Joe I don't have I don't have faith for a lot of things and I love this quote and I had this and but the Saunders name will recognize this I used this quote up in Arizona a few months ago I got the studying the other script the other message I got out of who you are or who are you was one the power of words and I found this quote he said brother but the brain was talking about people who said something to him they didn't have enough faith didn't have enough faith he says if you don't have enough faith he said go the adopted baby route how many ever heard that before go the adopted baby route he preached that an eagle stirreth up her nest and he goes on to explain what the adopted baby route is he said you know what you take a mother that can't have a baby she tries and tries to tries to have a baby and she can't have a baby so she will adopt Allah and then not all the times but a lot most of the times when she quit stressing out and worrying about having a baby she ends up having a baby he said so you take that need that you have and you approach that need with adopted baby around brother branham what brother branham was telling to do you take that need and you put it up here in your mind you put it up here in your mind you start thinking positive thoughts about that need and you come in here on Wednesdays and Saturdays and Sundays you get it a well checkup you rock it you sing lullabies to it whatever that need is every thought that you give it you change it you feed it that adopted baby is gonna begin to grow and when that enough the baby grows about brother Donnie always says about 14 inches it'll end up down here I believe I preached the sermon here two three years ago but the brain said you know if you can't have faith you know he said do the next best thing you know he's talking about thinking positive you get what he said pray for doctors pray for nurses everything you know it's not all about working up faith but Donnie didn't preach the series here not too long ago about positive thinking so you got a you got a possession in your life you struggle with things in your life whether it's healing you feel like I can't I can't get enough enough faith to believe for my healing sometimes when you're the one hurting when you're the one hurting sometimes you need somebody else to believe with you you have to but Terry's sister Alice needs you will go into her liver disease problem she needed brother Terry's faith she needed our faith buts it is I could see maybe sister Alice is mine it's hard to have faith if you but you can think positive you can think positive I believe God's help me just think I'm I'm healing you get that whale body you see that whale body out there and you walk towards that whale body come brother Bram say every time they come off path platform go your way thinking God there's people that's come across this platform and got hands laid on them for sickness and walked away with it thanking God thanking God so they adopted baby around you got a lost son lost daughter lost husband you kid on drugs lost wife or whatever whatever is you get it if you can't have faith for it it's hard when you're stressed out sometimes when you're worrying so much about your kids it's hard sometimes to have the right kind of faith because that worry that stress piles up to start thinking God get a positive thoughts in your mind and start thinking that way let's talk about boundaries God told Israel where to set their boundaries we have boundaries I'm gonna use these things y'all take a break I was about 15 years old how many members brother Danny Williams I love that man I was about 15 years old and ruther Danny Williams come to Kentucky he took two mic stands really he took two mic stands and he used them as boundary markers he preached the message on boundaries he was touched it took these boundary markers and he talked about God telling Israel we move into the land a brother Danny started moving using the boundary markers he said God you know would take them and they go past Jericho and they moved the boundary this way and they would stretch out that boundary the next city over and they move that boundary they move it finally if I had all this land and then he took them same boundary markers he said let's use these boundary markers in your life right here's where Satan wants you boundary markers right here cuz you ain't got nothing you can't move you can't build a house right here there's no land and you can't make footsteps footsteps our possessions so you got sickness in your life you got cancer right over there is healing you've got to move this boundary over there to have this healing you have depression right over there is joy and this boundary marker has to go from here to there here's the key to that God said that was yours it should be as simple as walking over and putting your boundary marker across joy putting your boundary marker on healing you've created footsteps you've got if you can build a foundation in here now but so often Satan tries to move that boundary marker yeah you wasn't really healed anyway you know what you're probably right that joy you had it was that pill that you took remember that the one real joy there's just that pill you took and so often he gets us right back in here these boundaries should be so far you should even seem everything that God has to push your boundaries so far that you can't even seem because I'm thinking if I can see my boundaries I don't have enough land I don't have enough possessions hey I'm going to be greedy when what God gave me I'm going to be greedy I'm gonna get all I can get whatever as I was saying sometimes to move these boundaries it takes faith of others you don't want when your wife or your husband's in the hospital dying you know somebody needs to grab this with you so my hands to grab us with you somebody has to help you move it because sometimes whenever you got cancer you got liver disease and you need these boundaries move past that healing to pull that healing in their savings going to push them in it's a body move y'all the body heals itself ask any nurse any doctor everything that you need for healing is in the human body the body can heal itself but it's all ours studying this you know you I was looking at the Sara Phoenicians woman it wasn't for her it wasn't for you know in studying this I'm will jump ahead my notes I think cuz I don't know where I'm at now but it was it for her what did Jesus tell her healing is the children's bread and sometimes I think we're starving to death I think we're starving to death it that's freely given its the children bed but it's not he said it's not for her if somebody but God could give it to somebody that wasn't for what about those that it is for every that's that's why that's the way he was and in studying this in the last sermon I had a power of words I got to read about the Gentiles the same situation that happened with Israel the same thing that happened with Israel taken they're not taking their land not taking what God had sent what God had given them happen or unfolded again right back in in acts acts 1346 what Paul tell them but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of an everlasting life they wouldn't go get it they wouldn't take it you know I just listened to a sermon today is it I don't the state of scriptures fulfilled in 65 February 65 brother Graham said you know in the in the scripture talks about my son has come out of Egypt but Graham said it was a twofold that was a twofold fulfillment in that scripture was Jacob coming out of Egypt children of Israel they come out of Egypt God brought him out he said the other fulfillment was that was the greater son he said Jacob was the son that came out of Egypt my son has come out of Egypt I've called my son out of Egypt he's the second one he said was the greater son was Jesus Christ come out of Egypt and they turned him down here again and act and Paul tells him X 13 and 46 but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life and then What did he say from this day I turned to the Gentiles I turn to the Gentiles I turn to you and the Gentiles rejoiced it wasn't for them reading the New Testament Jesus tells his disciples do not take this to the Gentiles it wasn't for them there was Gentiles living in that day that were ordained to eternal life when jesus said don't take us to him because paul says when he turns to the gentiles those that word ordained to eternal life accepted it [Music] so when bought when never Paul does it turns around what does he see this is what he sees right here in Gentiles we're gonna take it we're gonna set up boundaries everything that the Jews wouldn't take we want it [Applause] I don't remember who it was brother Darrell brother Donnie preaching that around the first of the year talked about Paul doing a full body move and turning to the Gentiles and that Gentile dispensation started on that body move and I got the wonder brother Terry after hearing that I'm sitting there listening one more and brother Don is preaching that I thought how long would the Gentiles follow them around how long and they followed him around listening and hearing this these men speak this word and these men refused to speak to him before this happened the Gentiles actually came up to Paul and said preach it to us we want it we want to hear it pop and preach it to him he couldn't preach it too how would you like how would you like to be in your life how would you like this in town word coming this day and they say no it's for people of Kentucky Tennesseans you can't have fewer vane to turn eternal life you'd follow it around you would follow it where everywhere it went until they turned and spoke to you that's what these Gentiles did they said we'll take them possessions any possession that they don't want we'll take it so they've been that started the boundary move the church ages is moving boundaries all the way from from Paul up to now what did Paul move the boundary to what was Paul's boundary on the other side you have to be saved through Jesus Christ dying on the cross and move that boundary past that what was Luther Luther found that you had to be justified he moved that boundary past that Wesley see that you have to be sanctified Luther couldn't move his boundary past sanctification it wasn't his that wasn't given to him and was he given him yet Paul couldn't move it through sanctification justification it wasn't given to him it pentacle Hoover past the holy ghost pouring over the Holy Spirit Malik had four and five would it push it back who you really are he said boundaries past who you are and what that encompassed everything that God had for you then boundaries can't go any further the problem is that we refuse to see where the boundaries are at we've set up our own little boundaries in our life and we get them up around our feet and we can't walk we can't move but God says I've set these boundaries here if you get your human nature out of the way if you get your human eyes out of the way and you see everything that I've got for you you won't need your boundaries you can use mine [Applause] I'm getting away I'm not gonna get to everything I apologize prodigal son I'm gonna skip some stuff prodigal son I love the story about the prodigal son and possession so much because look what he took with him look what he took with him and look what he left he took his own possessions with him they didn't last you know you can you can pile up all the worldly possessions there's some people that just have to have stuff there's nothing wrong with that everybody's different people have to have stuff this guy had to have stuff told his daddy give me what's mine let me have it that he's rich and he took it with him and it took it took tests and trials for him to see that everything that he truly owned he had left it back at home everything that was really his he left it at home everything the daddy had was his daddy proved it when he came back put his robe on him killed the best calf he had put his ring on him everything that God the best that God has let me put it that way the best that God has belongs to you when you realize who you are I put a note down here when you realize who you are and you've staked a claim to all that God has for you Satan don't want to be on that land when you realize when you get a revelation of this is mine he don't want to be on that because he knows he's got to fight let's stand together [Applause] mother Branham says in Abraham c59 you're an heir to it air of salvation air of divine healing air of every tempted blessing Jesus died for you are the heir to it for you are Abraham see your air of the whole thing the whole thing not in part the whole thing he says I feel religious now that I'm an air you may think I'm just a little crazy but if I am just leave me alone I'm more happy that way then I was the other way I said I like this way the best but I know that I'm an heir heir of salvation heir of every promise this is why you Pentecostal people you sing every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line then act like it rock around and see what see what you got in here it's all of yours your heir to it so walk around take possession it belongs to you God gave it to you what a beautiful promise that you might say you Billy Joe I don't I don't think it I have I have enough faith to claim that I try so hard but it's so hard it's I struggle against the devil I've probably I know I've read this scripture probably with half of sermons I preached here but I'm going to read it again James 4:7 submit yourselves to God resist the devil and he will flee the other day I decided to look up the word resist it does not say submit yourselves to God calling an army an airstrike call nine-one-one and he will flee that word resist means just don't move be unmovable you've claimed your land so stay on it and don't move you don't have to call a prayer meeting because the devil's coming up against you don't move [Music] you see but Joe I don't know if I have I don't have enough in me for that and studying this sermon I preached in Arizona about power of words I got the looking deeper into Legion yeah everyone have to forgive me a minute and when I was reading region Legion that I recall brother Donnie preaching that sermon but how many angels it took to put Satan into the pit one angel didn't even give him a name a nameless angel so he wasn't very highly ranked one angel put him in the pit now I was reading in the maniac of Ghaderi so the Legion had two thousand demons on him mm but he had enough we sit here we complained about the little test in the trials that we go through you claim there's no more greater in your life to Jesus Christ and you complain about the tests and the trials that we have to go through the pain that you have to go through and this is a man with 2,000 demons and he had enough inside of him that Jesus heard him from other the other side of the sea because God placed something in him before the foundation of the world without that he didn't ever been able to get free Jesus wouldn't hurt anything else but the Father calling from him when that seed spoke and you struggle from day to day and feel like you can't make it we I say we not you us everybody we're human but the part of that but I have a problem with this Legion never had the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost wasn't sent yet he found somebody that would hear him there was something down in there greater than 2,000 demons can you think anybody greater than that but Jesus would come to live inside of you that God would would we'll play something down and you loved you so much before we even before you were even born for this world was ever born God had you in his mind that he loved you so much they'd placed a part of him down inside of you he loved Legion so much that he placed a part of him down there I can't wait to find out his real name brother Terry I want to find him because if you claim that you can't you got the Holy Ghost and then you kill him but you can't make it through Laodicea he's gonna stand against you on Judgment Day let's say I had two thousand two thousand demons on me I do have a backache that's life but that's the truth I don't I don't mean to be hard but that's the truth we're soft they were in a battle but he's gay he's giving you everything that you need for this battle he's giving you everything we want to have no excuses when we leave here brother Greg will have no excuses you have nothing no reason not to make it through everything that comes your way no reason because there's no one greater than Jesus and you claim that he lives inside of you let him do the fighting God told you in a visitor I'll drive him out for you I'll Drive him out I told you the same thing but the hair can we sing that song there's no one greater than Jesus let's worship him a little bit I didn't mean I really didn't mean to hold you this long [Applause] my life for so tired no easily chains cannot hold me so lonely so sexy [Music] is that coming from the other side we'll see [Music] yes [Music] every scene you I'll sing a song cause and Jesus there's no Jesus No great jeez Hey rejected first intestine no nice will I was a talker conversation relation so shadow insane ah [Music] [Music] No [Music] again to today [Music] to [Music] great and Jesus [Music] great and Jesus there's no Jesus
