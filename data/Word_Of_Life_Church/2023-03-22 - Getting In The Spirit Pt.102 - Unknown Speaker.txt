God bless you let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 10 tonight if you would a great trip to not in the name of the Lord Jesus so happy to be together again tonight in the house of God I love going to church I love going to church I love singing I love praying I love praising I just love loving God I just love loving I was ordained to love him to serve him to live for him to be his amen God bless you let's pick up where we was looking at on last Wednesday night First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 10. now beseech your brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing that there be no divisions among you now what you notice that Paul because of this contention and Division and stuff that's got into the Corinthian Church Paul is not unchristianizing these people they don't call them serpent seed and you don't call them a bunch of devils but he actually calls him brethren and he said by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that shall speak the same thing that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment wow wouldn't that be something and the same mind and then the same judgment so it's the word your judgment is the ability to look at something and look at it without impartiality so you don't judge it for this brother and you judge it one way and then you look at that brother and you judge it another way and look at that brother and you judge it another way but it's Paul Desiring the word mind is nuos which is different from fronio but it's a different word that we use the English language of mind for but it's being able to Value things look at things and discern them and judge them so this is what Paul was wanting to do Howie lays that foundation and then he tells them why they need that verse 11. for it has been declared unto me of you my brethren about them which are of the house of cloy that there are contentions among you strife debate variance wrangling verse 12. now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul I am of Apollos eye of cephas and eye of Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul now it was not that these people were saying well Paul is my Prophet messenger and a policies and evangelists and cephas is one of the foundation Apostolic Brothers but it was more exclusive it was like it was Paul and no one else Apollos and no one else cephas and no one else will we always have people that we are blessed by ministers more than others yes we will will there be certain ones that will be able to speak to us and just seem like you can receive so much from them yes is there a danger in that not necessarily not unless you isolate that individual and you can receive from no one else other than that individual then you're in trouble because then you're only one preacher away from not believing in Preachers you understand so if you get to where you're only a one person just a one preacher person then all Satan has to do is to hinder you with that one preacher and you lose confidence in him or he hurts you or whatever and then you no longer believe in him at all how many like to be remembered to as we pray God bless you to spot our heads Heavenly Father we come tonight with Thanksgiving in our hearts Lord gratefulness Lord Jesus for all that you've done for all of us we want you to know we're so grateful that we can be gathered together here tonight Lord and just still so happy that we've been able to move into our place and this is ours that you've given it to us and we're so thankful no more meetings at the Holiday again no more here and there and there we feel sort of like the children of Israel we've arrived and we're just so happy that we have and Lord God we're just thankful that you have proved yourself Among Us and every time we've been here you've met with us and we believe and accept nothing less than that because where we are is where you wish to be so we've come again tonight that we might be able to sing and worship and pray and testify bring prayer requests and just be able to submit everything that we are to you tonight I pray that you'd help me to get out of the way anoint me father with your presence but that wouldn't do a whole lot if you don't anoint them so I pray that should help them to be able to get out of the way me getting out of the way is only part of the equation they also must get out of the way to be able to hear and be able to receive and be able to pull help them Father that they'll be open to the channel of the Holy Ghost and they'll be able to listen and not just hear a Kentucky preacher stand up here but they'll be able to hear the spirit of God speaking to us tonight would you granted Lord we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said God bless you you may be seated I would imagine that a lot of these people No Doubt sought they were LED of the Lord by taking this stand most Christians are not going to do things out of spite or Envy or jealousy or because they think they're wrong they're going to do it because they feel like they're right and that's where that it's so tricky for us as Christians that we have to be so careful and what we do what we say our attitude our frame of mind and we judge it by the word now we're much easier to judge others many times than we are ourselves but I figure if we would judge everything that we do that would be a whole lot more capable of judging those that are around us with the proper type of judgment so no doubt many of the people felt like that they were right in their stand now we know that Satan absolutely hates true Oneness and unity and if you haven't heard the sermon uh called Oneness just the one word Oneness preached in 19 62 preached at the Branham Tabernacle and a while it'd be good to listen to it I absolutely love that sermon I've listened to it I don't know how many times in the last in the last decade since I've been in the message but it just speaks such volumes to my soul and I see from that sermon and immediately brother damn doesn't talk long it doesn't say a whole lot of preliminary stuff but he goes straight into it and he starts in the Garden of Eden with God and God making Adam and Eve placing them there in the garden and showing the very Perfection of Oneness and what it was and then he shows us how that that simple Oneness was broke between the man and his wife and then it was broke of course between God and it's an absolutely powerful sermon so Satan hates Divine Oneness and divine unity and what he will try to do is use the very same principle for thousands and thousands of years and that is divide unity and then reunite people under his idea of unification now he'll always have an agenda so he never divides people without already having something laid out to reunite them brother Brandon gives several examples in that sermon there so Satan divided Eve from her husband by what by breaking God's word and then he United her was who the serpent so whenever she believed the devil's lie then the prophet said she accepted it in her mind and death actually stepped inside of her soul so her Unity was broke with Adam broke was God but then she made another decision to unite with the serpent so breaking of unity is only step one of Satan's plan but he will always have a reunification nation that he wants you and I to unite with so if he can get us to break with the word break with the message of the hour break with the teachings of the truth he always has something else you watch people when they leave this word when they pull away from this message most of them will not stay on their own and have nothing to do with anybody else a lot of them have already been uniting behind the scenes and they've been talking to this person that person another person and there's already a reunification going on and they don't even consult with people that they should talk to about it but their mind begins to question the heart begins to question and you watch someone they leave the word of the hour and they'll go this way that way that way that way and they will reunite again with something against the very truth that they just left now that's Satan's way it's nothing new now he will have new names for new DOC he'll have new ideologies that'll meet the day the request and the desire of the day but it's the exact same principle that he used against Eve in the Garden of Eden and that was to be able to convince her that he is so concerned about her current situation can't you see how I presented that to Eve that he's presenting this uh opinion of God and this idea of God that God is trying to deprive you God don't really love you like he said or he would let you do this and that and the other but you God is is really depriving you of so much stuff now he's already got a reunification plan made before he ever divides her away from the program of God and and his words would absolutely been powerless if she would have not taken them into her mind received them down into her soul then she becomes the body by which he will enter into the human race it's the same way with human eye he'll try to disarm us by getting us to doubt our weapon and then he will unite us with either fear or unbelief or trauma or symptoms or whatever it is that you're dealing with he already has something else for you to be reunited with if he can get you separated from the pure love of God if he can get you separated from the things of God he will reunite you with hate with variance with emulation with Strife with jealousy for everything you and I let go of that God has us United with Satan has something there to replace it but I'll tell you looking at the agenda that he has I don't want none of his garbage he can keep it how many will say Amen now let's look again and watch the master builder now remember these this word here identifying Paul is not my words but it was Paul's word that he identified himself as a master builder now we've got some brothers here in the church and I would consider to be Master Builders and and they're they're very very good at what they do now I can build a little bit I can take a little bit of wood and maybe build a bed build up you know a nightstand I can build a few things like that but whenever I go to looking at a plan I saw all these plans of all this that was laid out I couldn't make head or tail out of it I couldn't understand one thing about it all them angles and this and that and the other yep there's Brothers here that was able to do it I saw brother Phil Gould's take them plans and lay it out you see these beautiful handrails that you see here all these around through all that I talked to other films that both feel I'd like something a little different I don't want it just to be the regular standard handrail I'd like something to to be a little bit different well what have you got in mind he said well I I've seen some handrails that I've saw in hospitals and industrial type buildings and they're they're larger I think I know what you're talking about but I'll talk to a guy so brother Phil had a guy to make a profile a profile of this and a profile of that now he knew what to call it all I didn't know what to call it I didn't have the word for it but by him knowing them sort of saying he helped me to bring out something I wanted this to be able to look at didn't it turn out nice and yet for me to say well I want to say look at me and say where are you from boy where in the world have you got in your mind but for somebody that's above me in understanding now why is mother feel above me because he knows how to build some of these other brothers the same way so it's unlike me that can take a piece of Walnut and transform it into something and make a night stand for Carol or make a canopy bed or make a mirror or something like that that's that's not a master builder so Paul is not just an evangelist Paul isn't just a preacher that could preach A good sermon but Paul was the master builder of the first church age now no doubt these people felt like that they were so spiritual because most people when they become isolationists in other words they are pulling theirself away from the rest of the body I don't need a pastor I don't need a church I don't need this and that I'm so spiritual and all that most of the time when they get there they're already in trouble already so Paul is now going to identify how these people really were they no doubt felt they were so spiritual but notice the way Paul identifies them from First Corinthians 3 3 for ye are yet carnal well then I want their spirituality out the window so they probably felt they were so spiritual and they had such understanding to make Apollos their leader and to make Paul their leader and oh we don't need Peter we don't need a Polish now remember Paul was a prophet and a church-aged messenger and Peter wasn't a prophet but yet Peter had some great input in the apostolic church and Apollos was a great preacher an evangelist Mighty the Bible calls this man Mighty in the scriptures now that's where we see him first appear so he was a man that had great benefit into the body but yet these people and now were divided and fussing and arguing among themselves and Paul identifies this as not being spiritual at all but carnal and happy about it whoops I'm sorry Word of Life calling you by your own name hard to break him old habits and Word of Life Church said for ye are not carnal for whereas there is among you in being and strife and divisions okay so every move that has ever hit this message purusia seven Thunders no Ministry on and on and on and on look at every one of them all of these traits followed every one of those moves why because the founders of those moves which were men with an agenda not with the same Minds that the master builder had now listen to him I'm going to run ahead of myself but just for a few moments that a preacher can actually build on the same Foundation that the apostles laid but he can use material that is combustible now Paul Likens this plan of God to a house that is being built and he said that a man can lay on this Foundation materials such as wood hay or stubble but that's not what Paul laid Paul laid Rock Stone so it's totally possible for a preacher to spend years of his life building on the foundation of truth but he lays and builds the stubble of his own agenda or he has the wheat or the the straw of an of an ambition and he's an ambitious man an opportunist preacher that waits for an opportunity to be able to build something around himself and the whole move is around him I saw when these men die the move collapses why because it's built on a man instead of built on the rock of the word well let me tell you one thing they're not Word of Life if you're built on me I feel sorry for you because I am getting to be an old man I'm only one breath away from being out of here so don't build on me build on Christ the word is that right we don't want to build on this man or no other man oh brother Donnie we're built on brother random no we are not built on brother Brandon we are built on Christ the word brother Brad I'm also being a master builder my brother Branham did not lay himself but he laid Christ on this pyramid of the Bride now what so Paul first has to kind of rebuke him a little bit and he says are you not yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men so first of all Paul has to strip away the symbolism that they have elated themselves into that they are so spiritual and they are so phenomenally Supernatural and they know so much about this and I know he said just look at the attributes of what's among you all and just look and see what your attitudes has produced and it will tell you that carnality has moved among you now notice now he's going to identify what it is and he don't say they're sitting around with video games in their hands and they're sitting there you know watching TV 24 7 and he doesn't say they're out running The Honky Tonks and doing all this that another but notice what makes them carnal they are so tied up in one preacher that they don't want to hear nobody else well that ain't spiritual at all if you're that way tonight you're carnal too for why one says I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos are you not carnal now remember he brings it over from chapter one on over to chapter three now against Apollo's wishes there was this this faction in the Church of Corinth against Paul's wishes now the letter to the Corinthian Church was actually written in the city of Ephesus so Paul is there in Ephesus and guess who is with Paul while he's in Ephesus Apollos Apollos was a great teacher very very smart but also a great evangelist now it was against Apollo's will as it was against cephas will which is Peter and also against Paul's will for these factions to be determined now in this situation it was not the preachers that wanted this to be this way but it was actually Satan which was moving among the body so Satan that got among the sheep and started dividing the Sheep now it was not a set of preachers that was in the wrong so Paul was not going behind Apollos back and running him down Apollos was actually with Paul when this was written so Apollos was right there now I want you to listen to this now so Paul strongly urged Apollos to go back to the city of Corinth but he would not go now listen Paul wanted him to go because what Satan is trying to do Satan is trying to divide the ministry he's trying to divide the brothers now the division is not between themselves but it's because Satan has been able to get on some sheep and divide them from Paul and divide these from Apollos and divide these from cephas and then divide the other group from preachers all together so and Satan wants to divide them because he knows this church is absolutely Unstoppable as long as they stay together he knew that Corinthian Church was Unstoppable remember God spoke to Paul and told him to say the UN Corinth and he was there for about 18 months or a little longer and preached to these people and the Lord Jesus said I have much people in this city so the devil was going to attack them like never before and he couldn't get between the preachers which is a rare thing but he couldn't get between the preachers because the preachers were one so what Satan did was then he divided the people now do you understand what was going on here in the city of Corinth in this church it was a demonic warfare it was not just a difference of opinion but demons were coming among the church people and causing them to argue and debate and so no doubt when they'd come to church depending on who was going to preach you know Paul was up there then they'd screamed and holler the Paul lights would scream and holler amen glory to God and if Apollos was going to preach then the others would scream and holler oh how pitiful we ought to be amening the word we shouldn't be Amen in our favorite preacher who's preaching it is that right now watch this in First Corinthians chapter 16 verse 12 Paul says as touching our brother upon us I greatly desired him to come unto you with the Brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have a convenient now now Paul felt the necessity to let the Corinthian Believers know he had no jealousy at all toward Apollos so he makes this part of the public letter which is going to be written to the Corinthian Saints he wants them to know that he did not keep Apollos from coming back to preach you with me he wanted to be able to let them people know so it would stop the mouths of them demons among the saints of God I want you to think friends how sometimes when we get into situation and we're saying well it's his brother against that brother says sister against that sister if you could only look and see with spiritual eyes it would probably scare most of us to death it's demons demons out of hell getting on good people that love God now as I said these people were not demons themselves Paul classifies them as brothers so they were people who loved the Lord they were people that thought they was excelling in the agenda of God and yet demons had got among them and dividing them and they was arguing and fussing and debating how pitiful and it had to be dealt with now notice so then Paul first he wants to set forth and I want you to notice what he calls Apollos as touching our brother our brother Apollos I greatly desire listen to the words now this is not a little guy that can take up couple of boards and build a little birdhouse this is not a God that can be able to take up a few boards and and build up a hog trough to be able to feed them some slopping but this is a master builder so his choice of words are precise and correct and exactly what the spirit of God would be able to help break that division which is God Among the people because part of the apollocytes no doubt they thought well Paul ain't gonna let him come back no more now we see what kind of man Paul is he's trying to keep him away from the church so Paul said well let me just let you all know I actually invited Apollos himself to come and preach but Apollos would not come you imagine them Devils went into heart spells they're looking for their nitroglycerin oh no don't tell me oh no he doesn't cut our head off that's what men of God do they stand right there and take that word and slice the devil like pastrami notice but he said his will not me not me there is no telling what this one verse done in the Corinthian Church but his will was not to come at all at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time now he does not want them to suspect jealousy he does not want them to expect anything wrong there's nothing wrong between them brothers and Paul also wants them to know that he has a freedom from this type of preacher jealousy oh I wish a lot of guys in her ranks had that why because it is selfish they can't stand it to watch God bless another man now listen this myself I I can relate maybe a little bit to the way that Apollos must have fell now we know that when he first appears the Bible says that he was a man that was mighty in the scriptures and he was taking the Bible and making known to the Jews about Christ about who he was and of his Messianic visit to the Earth but he didn't know really about the dispensation of the Holy Ghost and all that so the fourth Century historian and theologian Jerome uh one of the patriarchal fathers says about this right in it from a historical perspective that Apollos was so broken-hearted because the people had raised up this faction in the Corinthian Church he refused to go back there is not another place in the scripture where Apollos ever visited the Church of Corinth again now think why would he do that this man was so greatly used in Corinth I believe myself it was Satan Satan trying to stop that great man of God try to divide the people and if that didn't work stop that man from ever coming back to the city of Corinth so actually what Apollos did was he opted to stay away and as I said no scriptural place that we ever had that he ever went back again why why because the people allowed demons to get among them let me just share a personal story with you tonight can I visited a country many years ago I went there for special meetings the Lord met us in a mighty way I don't know when I've ever stood under such an anointing there was Miracles there was healing the anointing on the word was just phenomenal the Lord just really really showed himself how great he was that's what it was too but after I got back home from being in that place it was reported to me that the people of that assembly the pastor and some of the other visiting people that were there began to say that my Ministry was the voice of the Midnight Cry now where they were taking this from was Matthew 25. about midnight they went out a cry go you out to meet the bridegroom so they started trying to promote me that this is all of me being totally ignorant of it but they were saying ah my Ministry was going to be the voice that was going to awaken the bride what a shame I said what a shame now when I heard that from a dear friend of mine it like to broke my heart and I thought Lord what am I to do for years then people have wanted me to come back I've never been back because all it would take would be someone to say I think brother Donnie believes that it would spread around the message that I preached it or I promoted it or I believed it and I was totally innocent what happened Satan getting among the people to hinder my Ministry from ever being able to go back and be a blessing to that part of the world and you look at Apollos and what a straight that the man must have been in now those of you that's ever followed preachers around very much and and be with them as they preach in different places and you probably know that preachers have certain places that they prefer to preach in there's places I absolutely love to preach in and then there's places I just preach in uh-huh you think it's funny you ought to be there there's places that I go and I really don't like it there's places that I go that I never feel like I can ever get off the ground there's places I go I never felt like I've ever reached a climax of what God would want you to go but yet they want you to come they say you're a blessing and you go oh my goodness it's like going and getting a root canal or something like that Pleasant you know and you think Lord please let me get sick please let something happen Lord let something come up let there be a plan you know my plane will be grounded for 14 hours and I won't be able to that's just the way you feel but yet whenever something comes up and you so are excited about going and being a part of this convention or this and that and you can't go you just feel so sad and so low because it's just one of those places that God's given you favor with those people you can't buy that favor you cannot you cannot get it any other way than God given it to you so you can you imagine with me a little bit tonight how our brother Apollos must have felt because God used this man in such a way that he was as far as some of the people he must have been a man of such caliber and such understanding that some of the people it would have been almost like this that he just excelled to a level to what they thought was that to equivalent of Paul now we know paulus never preached that of course he never believed that about himself no doubt he had a revelation that Paul was a church-aged messenger and he would never Excel to that position but I wonder how many times and I have thought about it in the last last few weeks looking at Apollos I don't think I've ever actually preached on the brother other than just passing but I've been studying quite a bit about him everything that I could find and just thinking in my heart how the man must have felt and how sad and how he must have relived as I have the meetings that I had years ago in that place and still my mind I go back to those meetings although it's been decades ago and I think in my heart I love to go back and I'm not saying I wouldn't go back if God ever told me to I would but just that hanging over and you think Lord I don't ever want to be guilty of nothing like that but I want you to notice this man now this man was a caliber of man that would not allow his ministry to be a blessing to those that it could be a blessing to because it would have caused a division in the Corinthian Church now I guarantee you that there was a lot of men in this first century they would have had a total different View and a total different reaction to this scenario if they would have heard that they had a great pool in the Corinthian Church and that they had a great capacity of influence on the Corinthian people they would have caught the first ship or the first Chariot or the first donkey or the first pair of Nike shoes and they would have hiked back to Corinth and they would have went right there and you know what they would have done they would have split that church wide open but not Apollos you see Apollos looked at it and he waited out and he realized to divide this church how could he ever go and say well God bless him and maybe maybe Apollos could have come and said well the people want me to the people are pulling on me the people are really pulling he could have said that and then Paul could have come and said and Apollos was led and pulled by a bunch of carnal-minded people and they pulled him to make the wrong decision and my my church tonight I just want to make sure because y'all ain't even breathing or y'all know how you're doing that so Apollos gets so upset and so tore up that Upon Us joins with Zenus which was a converted Jewish lawyer an Apollos leaves Ephesus and he goes to Crete way away from Corinth he wouldn't go nowhere near now keep in mind they didn't have podcasts they didn't have streaming they didn't have televisions and all that sort of thing so the only way that they could have ever heard of paulus was actually in his body form Paul is as far as we know never even wrote One epistle not one thing so the only way that this could be carried on was for Apollos himself to go there but this man looked at the value and the stakes and he considered the price so if I do this what will it bring to the church at Corinth what will it do to the move of God so here he did not want to be the cause of the division in this local assembly so he decides I'm going the other way I will not go back and as I said there's no scripture where he ever did go back because carnal people under the influence of demons hindered this man's Ministry everybody want to break and go get a coat and come back or should I continue well I've got you read this man acts chapter 18 verse 26. speaking of Apollos to give you a little insight of this man's great ability and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue home one Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly now he he was a couple of dispensations behind but one thing I love about this preacher was he was a man that could take instruction when you find that you found a jewel keep him notice so here is equivalent of Priscilla which is a man and his wife now they were living of course in Rome and they were Roman citizens and they had heard this man speak but they knew that he was he was behind so he was taking some of the scriptures and and showing oh eloquent speaker and really really noted in the scriptures you see this is why this man would not cause the division in the Corinthian Church because he knew the scriptures acts 18 27 and when he was disposed to pass into China the Brethren wrote I want you to notice now how the Apostolic Church moved we say that we have been restored to the apostolic faith but I wonder sometimes I want you to notice how that the ministers worked with the churches and how that uh an evangelist did just not go here and there and there and hand out his card and I'm going to go here that's that's not the way they worked at all they went by recommendation so this kept out a lot of sedition this kept out a lot of wolves now notice what happens when the Brethren hear him the Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him so the brothers here they write to the people at Corinth so this man went through the apostolic protocol I guarantee one thing we'll be a whole lot better off if we operated churches and the messages like this right here instead of it's amazing to me that people can sit in a church and the pastor not use them because he knows there's something that just ain't quite right and yet other preachers will use them and you think they don't even call the preacher that the pastor to ask about him and we claim we're restored back to Bible Faith which Bible are you reading now notice this is in your Bible Well Bible Believers right we are Bible believers so the Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him now you see the Corinthian Church would not have received Apollos without reference from other people other believers that were established in the truth well this is your Bible you can set it when you get home notice so the Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much now notice so this brother one visit one visit makes such a powerful impact can you imagine what they could have gleaned out of this man's Ministry for years and years and years to come if they had not allowed the devil to bring this division among them what a shame this man of God Harry was able to give them so much stuff but I wonder how many nights said he laid on his bed and cried and wept and felt God what can I do if I go back I know it's going to cause a division in the church and it will be my name will be associated with this down Through the Ages I'm so glad that we can read this about our brother I've done got a new hero in the New Testament I don't mind telling you I was laying there awake this morning before daylight thinking I can't wait to walk up there and Shake That brother's hand God bless you brother thank you for being a gallant man of God thank you for not going down there and you know wanting to build you a big name or a big reputation or whatever more and divide in that church at Corinth my goodness they had enough problems the way it was didn't they but I want you to notice now that the Bible says that he helped them much which had believed through Grace oh it doesn't really tell us what all that he preached but it must have been so wonderful now let me read you a few scriptures and show you that what I'm preaching here to you tonight is from your Bible your Bible and show you how that the church was set up and how the church was supposed to grow and multiply and Hound that they actually sent letters of commendation or recommendation and this is the way the ministry was to go out second Corinthians chapter 3 verse one Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others now notice Paul is writing to the Corinthians and telling them do I need letters of recommendation I am the one who founded this church do I need these letters do you all need me to be recommended but I want you to notice that it's not rebuking letters of recommendation because he says Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others so some others didn't need them so it wasn't like this God just jumped up overnight nobody knew it nobody heard about him nobody knew absolutely nothing about him and he starts taking the big tours through the message and preaching all over the world and nobody ever heard of him before believe it or not that has happened in our ranks why because we don't follow Apostolic Forum from the Bible and the church said you see if we would do this it would eliminate a lot of this stuff and it would scare the liver out of these Kingdom building preachers because they're afraid that be exposed but they know they can move Among Us and do these things and very few is going to call their ham will you happen to be looking at one tonight who will well praise the Lord now notice or letters of commendation from you so why is Paul quoting this now this seems very odd to us but this was a common thing that was done in the apostolic era now this is around 57 58 A.D so it's been going on for quite some time so a man would just come in hey I'm a traveling evangelist I'll let you well who knows you well nobody where do you come from well I'm from here and there whether from here from there go preach here and there because you ain't preaching for us until we find out who you fellowship with how many wives you God how many times you've been married what do you believe about that well come on Church what you want me to receive anybody and everybody that comes to you to stand up there and feed to you that preacher may be packing a lust devil he may be packing an old fornication devil he may pack in an old pornography devil you want me to let him stand up here and open up his soul to you and you walk out of your Anointed with that same evil thing that's on him no sir not as long as I'm in my right mind ain't doing it oh my now notice what happens here in Acts 11 22 then Tidings of these things came into the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas now notice how that the ministers was sent forth they did not go on their own well I I feel led to go over here to Timbuktu and I'm going to do this another no that's not the way it was listen to taking sides with Jesus 1962 and you'll hear Brother Branham say that he wished he had many young preachers that he could send to India that he could send to Africa and make them Outpost was his word an outpost in India an outpost in Africa and he says when he was there in many converts come to the Lord and he said in a few days he would be gone he said but how I'd love to add young men and say before I leave there be a young man that will come and Associates will come with him and they're on their Road and he said they'll be here to say established a church how is it supposed to be set up that's the way brother random said that it should be well notice the Bible now how they've done so whenever they begin to hear of things that was going on so it come into the ears of the church in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas you mean the church send forth Barnabas so Barnabas didn't go out on his own well I feel to go over here I feel you'll never find them words in the New Testament I feel to go do this I feel to go do that show me where it's at you see friends we have eroded from Apostolic truth and yet we pride ourselves in Ben Apostolic are we really why does it seem so strange to you tonight I'm reading it from your Bible now notice again in Acts 15 22 watch this it goes all through the New Testament then pleased it the apostles and the elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch was Paul and Barnabas so whenever disputes come up among the Brethren and among the churches so this man didn't decide oh I'm gonna go over and take care of all that I'm gonna go over and fix this and that another I'm gonna do this and that that's not the way it was in the Bible hmm so it was before the elders and the whole church to sin chosen men of their own company that they didn't go any many many more which one should be let go but it was Men of their own company if they're going to establish churches if they're going to straighten out issues they want men going from their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas surname's rather and Silas Chief and they wrote Letters by them out to this manner the apostles and elders and Brethren now amen whoa whoa whoa whoa where's the thing I feel led what's the same what these brothers said now I feel that that I need to go over there and straighten that situation where where's that at well I'm sorry honey you didn't know this is in your Bible you ought to spend more time on that book instead of on Facebook get ready Instagram and get instant Holy Ghost get rid of tick tock and get on the clock so here they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethrens sent greetings unto the Brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and solicia now the main thing here that's going on is some of the Jews have said these Gentiles have got to be circumcised they can't eat this they can't do that they can't do the other so instead of one man saying I feel led of the Lord to go over and straighten this whole thing out they said you sit down and shut up we're not even choosing you we can tell by your attitude you're the wrong guy so can you imagine the church assuming that they they are the ones that's going to straighten out this issue and if new works are going to be formed the church is going to be the ones to do it well that's only if we believe the Bible well it seemed like to me it's getting hot in here is it just me no it ain't okay I see some of y'all's face is getting red too for this much as we have heard that certain which went out from us ah here we go so you see some of them went out from them but they were not sent from them there is a great difference have troubled you with words now listen to what they've done subverting your souls you must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment and it seemed good unto us being a symbol was one Accord to send chosen men unto you you see friend a lot of our problems is many of us are so terrified of organization we hate organism now if message search is done this way right here the scripture where people say Lord have mercy they're acting like denomination oh no you've got it backwards this is the original and denomination only took their junk from this pattern so to scare us to death this is the way they dealt with issues in the original Church honestly believe there's going to be some folks restored back to the book of Acts it seemed good unto us being assembled with one Accord just send chosen men unto you was our beloved Barnabas and Paul men that have hazarded the lives in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we have sinned what you mean they felt like they had the authority to send people it did because they were the government of God on the Earth it's that joke she hang on for a few minutes this is it whatever you bind on a who's ever sins you remit they are remitted whoever sins you retain they are retained you don't know what kind of horrible feeling that is when you stand in that predicament when you know God will hold people accountable for something they've done and you can't even pray for forgiveness for them I'm not talking about church sanity anytime I come to church and everybody's smiling around and waving I'm talking about us being a Bible believing oh my goodness notice verse 27 we have sent therefore Judas and Silas who shall also tell you the same things by mouths huh so you mean these men didn't take it on their own they were sent from the church First Corinthians 4 17. Paul now the church age messenger for this cause have I sent unto you timotheus which is Timothy you mean Paul sent people Paul sent people you mean the real god-called ministers could actually work with Brothers in their Church they'll say brother we'd like to expand our work some of your brothers I'm getting too old to fly overseas any of your brothers got a burden to go here and there and there what about Kenya what about Tanzania what about uh China what about here or there there if you have a burden and I can see that in your heart I will wreck amend you to go he said that's the nomination no that's the original plan before there was ever a denomination oh my goodness for this cause have I sent unto you to mosius who is my beloved Son faithful in the Lord he shall bring into your remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I teach everywhere in every Church Second Corinthians 8 16 but thanks be to God which put the same Earnest care Into the Heart of Titus for you for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches so where is this stuff then a preacher is going out on their own and starting their own little denomination or whatever it is well where does all this come from not from the book of Acts or Corinthians or Ephesians but if it is show me stand right now um I thought so notice it I find this so amazing in the way that Paul brings us out so we have sent him with the brother whose Praises in the gospel throughout all the churches and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us oh my goodness you mean Paul the prophet of the age would let some of the local churches suggest that this man and this man and this man travel with them because they'd be such a blessing and such a help and Paul didn't have this known all attitude nobody tells me who travels with me I'm the prophet he would have never been the prophet hey they had that attitude my goodness can you imagine the churches chosen of the churches to travel with us with this Grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord and Declaration of your ready mind Philippians 2 25. yet I suppose it necessary to send to you epaphroditus how many of these gods did Paul said you need to tell me Paul said epaphroditus Paul said onesimus Paul sent Timothy Paul sent Titus Paul at the church is sent people Prince can't you see how contrary to scripture when people get in this idea all they need to do is sit at home and listen to it they don't never go to church they don't never have no fellowship with the body they don't ever oh I'm my own person I'm an island this is not an island move this is a body move we are not the Caribbean we are not Cuba we are a body and we need one another you see if our churches were set up this way it would eliminate a lot of the stuff that goes on around us yet I suppose that necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion and labor now watch the exhortation what's he doing is giving this brother a great recommendation now this man's going to go and Minister and he's going to go preach apparently he'd never been there before so what is he going to use what are his credentials notice they don't say jump the spoke in tongues he had a vision he had all these different signs he put before the Lord and the lamb the Lord answered all those signs he has the recommendation of a man of God not to the apostolic church that's what they look for not so much us you know we just we just let whatever come by notice my brother my companion and labor fellow Soldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that he had heard that you had heard that he had been sent Now watch how the sickness had actually brought a union there for indeed he was sick known to death but God had mercy on him listen this and not only on him only but on me also my goodness lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow so Paul says I sent him therefore the more carefully that when you see him again you may rejoice that I may be the less sorrowful now watch what he does he gives them him a recommendation and then he will change it and notice what he tells them now to do here it comes with this letter and he's telling them what to do receive him therefore in the Lord what's all gladness and whole such in reputation in high honor attained to our great position wow so this is an instruction from the church AIDS Messenger to be able to speak to us say the church at Philippi we've been in that day and you this brother comes through and we can tell this is Paul's handwriting this comes straight from Paul and he comes with this Mighty recommendation that he's a brother a fellow labor in the gospel well if Paul says this about him praise the lord we will receive him but what if he just comes out and say hey I heard y'all go to church over here I'd like to preach for you I believe the message I believe Malachi 4. I believe God sent a prophet every devil in hell believes that it ain't no longer we get so much garbage going on around us Colossians 4 10. our Mr Chris my fellow prisoner salutes him and Marcus sister son to Barnabas now this was Marcus which was Saint Mark touching him who you received Commandments if he come unto you receive him you mean this was a common practice recommendation letters of commendation you understand so what is Paul doing Paul does not want them people to only read his books he wants them to hear other God call men well if God started out his church that way he ain't going to end it by just praying the prophet's tapes and somebody said God never started his church out that way and he ain't going to end it up that way but he's going to end it up the same way that he started with one man receiving the word for the age others going out called by the same Holy Ghost preaching the same message bringing up the very end time as it started that was the alpha this is the Omega [Applause] oh my now notice this brother if he come unto you receive him now you can tell by the way Paul is writing this that he's not really sure which the way this brother is going to go notice in Philemon chapter 1 verse 10 I beseech thee from my son onesimus who I have begotten in my bonds which in time passed was to thee unprofitable wow we got to watch these preachers they will they will tell the good and the Bad and the Ugly on you won't they now I don't know how much you know about onesimus but anessimus was a runaway slave and whenever he'd run away from his master then Paul was able to meet him and Paul was Able by the grace of God to bring this man to a true conversion and Paul actually writes back a letter to the owner of the slave and he says anything that he's done wrong lay it to my church whatever's happened whatever he's done but now Paul is going to send forth this brother can you imagine how this guy had quite a reputation but if there's anybody that can help remove this brother's bad reputation it's a master builder because he knows how to take words and assemble them together orchestrated by the spirit of God and watch it go straight to the hearts of God's sheep and watch that hard Feeling Just dissipate why he's a master builder he ain't building a house made of steel and stone and wood and Clay but he's taking Revelation by Revelation by Revelation and laying that inside the hearts of the Saints I beseech thee for my son on Nissim assume I have begotten in my bonds which in time passed was to the unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me what's the recommendation now whom I have sent again thou therefore receive him receive him you mean this was an Apostolic practice well according to what I've read to you tonight it was so they would send out these preachers and they would go forth and preach and they would go as new works and go here and there and there and it was help holding back and holding down a lot of the error that they undo inevitably would come you know what amazes me the prophet of God that come in this day followed in that same pattern now brother random knew that his message was going to be relatively new to the world to us it's not new it's a restoration but to the world it would be relatively new and it would be a lot of people coming out of systems coming out of things they were into so it's got to be so careful how he lays the initial stages of this message so if they leave their denomination was hate in their heart and they leave their denomination with a lack of respect and they leave their denomination with a smart attitude and a know-it-all attitude then they bring that in and that becomes the foundation of the new move you understand so the foundation is so important March is a very special month to me March the 27th 1983 I stood in my Pentecostal Church down in Kentucky and introduced the message March the 27th 1983 so next week being what 40 years so it's a very special time to me so sometime after that I had brother Willard Collins to come from the Branham Tabernacle many of you have heard his name he's actually brother Paul Phillips grandfather and brother Paul actually came down with him just as a younger guy of course and whenever he was there I assemble the Collins he was going to speak for us and I said would you share some things with me and my family or things that you saw things that you heard being around brother Brennan now he told me several different things but he told me this and it always stood out to me I never knew why he told me but I've shared it with people all over the world pertaining to different circumstances in their life brother Collins was a ministerial uh study guy y'all heard of the Revival so-called that's been going on down in Asbury College in Kentucky you all heard about that a Methodist call is down there okay some of you have uh brother Collins actually that's where he came from so it was a Seminary Student he was a Methodist so he come to the message and actually did he felt that he had to leave and pull away from them not re-baptize and all of that so he said that he went to Brother Branham and said brother Branham how should I leave how should I leave the Methodist Church he said by the Collins leave as Peaceable as possible wow now this is not going to be deep okay you won't need your life jacket you won't need a boat because it's so deep it's going to be over the top of your head it's going to be so simple leave as Peaceable as possible go to them people and thank them for everything they have done for you thank them for the years that they have let's use you and their churches and it went through a whole bunch of stuff and I thought wow what a way to deal with him not to me that's not just a way to leave a church but that's the way just dealing with Humanity in a congenial nice Christian way now you'll imagine you're walking there yeah about the devils you're nothing but serpency I am now following the prophet of Malachi 4 I indict the whole Methodist generation I got you all you're going to hell well now that would have been real respect on it it's amazing how many message folks still don't know how to leave the church it's amazing how they don't even know how to treat one another and treat the Sinners out here look friends be kind to them it's the only kindness some of them will ever have you can't go wrong by being nice to people the Bible teaches us such I want you to notice then when brother Brandon was here he's preaching a controversial message and he has a great phenomenal Ministry of course as we know a miracle signs wonders things like that and it causes people to be drawn toward him and and many different Avenues of life and he knows this so now brother Branham is going to be faced with a dilemma how do I deal with some of these people that have seen what I'm preaching and they're coming out of those systems how am I going to deal with them what what what should I say how should I do it now if he lays the wrong Foundation and if he raises this message out of rebellion hatred standing against all the preachers will they ever get rid of that attitude or will they not come into the same message with this attitude of rebellion and standing against everything and everybody notice this Queen of the South 1958. now Sunday we don't ask people to leave their post to duty unless the church has fully cooperated and you have no services at your church we're here as a visitor we don't want to pull anyone from their post of Duty ah sounds like Apollos we're trying to help that church grow and we want every member at his own church wow and we want every member of his own church and if you have sickness and you want to be prayed for tomorrow night oh dear God don't tell me he said this but do message people have this loyalty to their position no why well there's one of two things if you've never heard this before or you've heard it and you simply don't believe it huh permission from your pastor tell him what you want to do wow now he knows he's calling out so if he said if he tells you not to come and be prayed for he's an old devil anyhow y'all just come on God and if that person comes to the message what kind of attitude do you think they're going to come with boxing gloves on don't tell me bless God I'll tell you one thing I'm not my last Pastor out I certainly care to knock you out Donnie Reagan can I go on thank you now if your church is having church tomorrow night you sick just ask your pastor I'm sure he would excuse you to come if you don't get into the line or get prayed for tonight wow some of you maybe wrote me letters and I answered the best that I could now the questions you ask me and Doctrine I referred you back to your pastor you see because I I don't do that it's nice I appreciate you putting that much confidence but you see all of us would agree or on Basics agree on the same thing but each man maybe two or three sitting here wouldn't and I'd say ask your pastor see because sometimes it causes a little friction in the church and we definitely want that because we want all you people to come out of them churches and leave them and we're we're here to bust up every Church in the country well what I'd like to know is if brother Branham didn't say that where does that Spirit come from and it's been among us since this message started oh Jesus brother by himself a little friction in the church and we don't want that now this is what he wanted we want you to be in Harmony and one Accord now I'm fixing to tell you what song your pastor is like I think of your pastor like the song Amazing Grace it was grace that brought me safe thus far and Grace will take me on so here's the way brother Branham likened the god called pastors it was grace that brought you safe thus far and Grace that'll take you on well why does not he incite the people to Rebellion and dropped the doctrine of serpency and dropped the doctrine of marriage and divorce and this and that and this I don't care I'm going to preach it anyhow bless God I feel led to tell it to it I'm here to call out a pride careful brother Bynum you're laying the foundation now a lot of men have come in and they've laid this on the foundation and that on the foundation and that on the foundation total different attitude and spirit than the master builder of our age I hate to say it but it's the scripture so I've got to some men's work will be burned and annihilated but they themselves will be saved so as by far I just quoted to you a scripture oh my notice this again Jezebel religion 1961 now this is one of Brothers favorite places he had great favor among these people I've actually talked to some of the people years ago whenever I first went up to this part of the country that was there in those meetings so many people writes me questions about marriage and divorce and so forth which is a tangle in the church and I always refer him back and say ask your pastor people wrote me letters here and said what about this and what about that I'll refer the letter back you get it see your pastor on little things because after all he's your Shepherd he's the one that God sent to watch over you wow wow and we might disagree on it then that causes oh I saw confusion and the church was was God doing it watch what some people think wow huh we don't want that no no we just want you to quit doing things that's sinful things out of the Bible keep moving on and you cause little frictions and things like that that upsets the church you mean brother Branham is concerned about the church being upset and frictions in the church brother M don't think that's okay so I'd rather your pastor tell you about marriage and divorce and these things and them things let him do it he's God's servant he's a clip to do it can anybody just at least squeak out it thank you now many of you people are writing me letters now wait a minute why didn't brother Branham say well the people are pulling me into it like apologies I didn't want to do it I didn't want to do it but I had to I had to do this I had to do it that's a deceived individual anyone who thinks God would lead them to break his Bible a very deceived that includes me you you you or anyone else God never leads any of us over the pattern of his word some wonder how many of our message churches have this Foundation that I've read to you tonight is it any wonder that over time the collapse you see a church built upon this Foundation of rebellion and disobeying God's word and it's heartbreaking because some men pour years into it and they've built upon a foundation sand and their labor and they sweat always felt so sorry for women pastors I mean first of all they ain't even called you imagine all the prayer all the sweat and all the preaching and I've seen some of them that could preach better than some men I knew that's a Marvel I mean we used to live in West Virginia and there's a woman a woman preacher there and she was one of Carol's favorite preachers [Laughter] because the woman really had some understanding it's your girl I mean she really had some understanding she wasn't just an ABC preacher she got down to XYZ and she wasn't even called to do it and she fought such burdens and she was under such a heavy load all the time I thought it ain't no wonder woman get home bake some pumpkin pies or apple or do something you ain't supposed to be preaching but can you imagine what a woman preacher stands before God and maybe she'll be saved and she will absolutely lose every bit of that work because she overstepped God's word I suffer not a woman to assert authority over a man but to be in silence is also saithful law so she labor she studies she preaches in vain dear Lord oh my God help us Lord Jesus how many loves him with all your heart well if you can't stand I'll come up and pray for you if you want to you can try to Mosey up many of you write me letters I'm saying brother Branham should we do this or do that always say ask your pastor because I'll do anything I can to answer on the great fundamentally Evangelical doctrines of the Bible but when it comes to that should we do this or that always refer to your pastor each man or there isn't two here but what would disagree with one of the other little technical things whether we should comb our hair on the right side or the left and mine I have no trouble he says but you know what I mean when we have those things so I always just say every congregation ask your pastor if he's let you far enough to be saved and filled with the Holy Ghost can't you trust him the rest of the way through if God honored him for that or why isn't he telling all of them to flee and leave can't you see the attitudes you leave in you will take with you and you will rejoin and rebuild what's that attitude so if it's hatred variance emulation strife they don't make what happens what you think you're led to do look at what's following you look at the fruit always had people told people to wrap me questions outside of what I preach on the platform here's my secretary what about this what about that ask your pastor if he let you this far until you receive the Holy Ghost he'll take you on ask your pastor you see because little things like that causes confusion therefore I leave away from it you mean brother Branham the messenger the seventh angel people may ask him the question he had the right answer and he wouldn't answer it because it would cause confusion in the church and yet many of our message preachers they don't care how much confusion they call that okay how much division I hate to be some of them friends I don't mind telling you I just heard of one in South Africa last week that I went into a church under a terrible circumstance a brother that had a pastor that had been there forever had a debilitating situation and a preacher right from among them went in and while this pastor was sick and going through so many things and divide that church take advantage if that Pastor Ever Needed people to stand with him it was then when they turn and walk away from him and eventually the brother died and some of the people telling me about it said they thought it was the breakup the finally just killed him that preacher and then people will stand before God friends this is serious church is serious Church ain't like a grocery store well I think I'll be over here I was thinking over there you better not go anywhere until almighty God tells you himself well I feel that well if you feel led the prophet of God said if you ever feel led to do anything put it with the word and consult your pastor but you know what people don't even believe that one either do they do you understand what it's going to be that day when people walk before God and they're going to be judged by this message brother they've heard preached we make fun of these out here I ain't worried so much about them I'm worried about us we say we believe this and we look down our noses at people who don't you only believe how much you obey let me say it again you only really believe how much you obey same for me or anybody else Well everybody's mad at me could take me out and buy me for supper tomorrow night or we could have one over here I guess except all of you that's mad please don't cook anything I'm gonna have a belly ache after church don't you love him since about it think about it what Satan tried to do he's done it down Through the Ages our church isn't exempt from it brother Tim preach Church isn't brother on Spencer No Church in the message is exempt from Satan trying to destroy us but a lot of it is up to us if we will allow it the Corinthian Church going to stop this in its tracks but they were the very ones Satan was using do you understand that the church people could stop all these false preachers a lot of these preachers that ain't bit more sin of God than the man the Moon is and the church people could stop it don't listen to them they're off the word don't give them the time of day but instead of doing it they follow them around God help us about his death oh my God says he was in a prayer line the other night and he said the biggest majority of the people that led across the platform to it by the time they got to him they were already healed they said because their pastors were sending their praying for him and by the time they got to him God had already moved for them why God heard their prayers Heavenly Father I pray you would help us Lord may we go back to our Foundation maybe look tonight Lord and who we are and where we are and what we believe and why we believe it that we believe your Bible do we believe the apostolic pattern all how we've seen Satan divide separate down Through the Ages you knew it would come oh yeah you could have stopped it but you didn't because you knew there were people in there that didn't really believe and you would let false teachers get among them to pull them away from the real body Lord God I pray you would help us Jesus if you see anything in me tonight Lord that displeases you please show me there's anything in my foundational belief God help me I go back and dig it up I Want to Be Right Lord may you look at every man woman boy and girl in this place tonight may we open our hearts and our souls to you and say Lord search us we don't want our work to be in vain so a preacher could give a great portion of his life and yet wind up his work be destroyed and burned the same master builder wrote that and said every man's work will be tried as by far so if a man built upon this Foundation would hey stubble the fire will try his work and if it will not stand the test of the fire his work will be destroyed yet he himself will be saved yet so as my father Lord I don't want that to be me I don't want that to be these people I don't want our work to be annihilated and destroyed because we got in permissive will we built upon a foundation other than your word and we lay wood hay stubble Pride arrogance emulation strife on the top of a stone foundation how come stone at Heritage Strife how can Stone be cemented to arrogance how can Stone be submitted cemented rather to Personal Agenda Keep Me Lord must be one stone upon another search US Lord Try Us Lord look at us dear God begin with me I'm the shepherd look at my heart my motives my objectives Try Me Lord help me Jesus Lord these other ministers here the deacons the trustees the song leaders the musicians Sunday school teachers brothers sisters or children search all of us Lord we don't want to work to be burned and destroyed and then we stand before you that day empty-handed some of these preachers that think they're doing so much and all they brought is division and separation among the body and they'll stand before you that day and not have one thing to present to you how sad how sad search us tonight Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus oh Father we want our work to be tried so we can be true we want our hearts to be faithful if you see any motive in me that's wrong and the objective any opportunistic ideas or opinions show me Lord I'll make it right oh Jesus May our church be built upon the rock of your word and if it is all hail can Prevail against it but it will never overcome us all hell may try and May challenge every individual here a lot never before but if we're built upon your word there's not enough devils in all of hell that can destroy your church Carol was reading to me the other day Lord where they put it in the new church director and how the church was started and I was told her so I'm so glad they did that to give the people an idea of kind of where it started from originated all those years ago in the 60s and started from a little small group and then grew and grew from one stage to another to another to another to where we are today where would we be today father had it not been for some of those forefathers they had a hard time they went through difficult challenges many of them that she was reading about I didn't even know them of course but I thanked you for them Lord because I realized that's what made a way for us to be here tonight many of them would probably Marvel some of their kids here tonight some of their family well some of them old timers have always said well oh my goodness I can't believe you I mean this is where it this is what it's wound up being all my that's the way it is we make the way for those coming behind us oh Lord God but what are we leaving for or we teach in a rebellion are we teaching them disrespect to your word to your men I can't imagine what another generation of these preacher Hayden tape only people are going to produce already this generation ridicules laughs and blasphemes preachers what will their children be God have mercy and they'll stand before you that day and there will stand your prophet and they will have to answer for every one of them quotes where he laid hands on preachers and ordained them to preach and they'll have to answer for every joke forever Blasphemous thing they said about preachers Lord God help us help us Jesus search US Lord Hallelujah anybody here with me tonight say Lord search me I want to look at my heart my soul I want to make sure what I believe what I'm doing what I'm a part of Lord I want to make sure it's your word I want to make sure my attitude help me Lord Hallelujah sing what you're playing there you
