[36:11] that's bad when the Devils don't know
[36:13] who you are and the man and whom the
[36:17] evil spirit was leaped on them overcame
[36:19] them and prevailed against them so that
[36:22] they fled out the house naked and
[36:23] wounded I'm gonna read a quote by the
[36:30] Brandon Bobby in where sixty five of God
[36:33] Richard mercy natal of my sermon if you
[36:38] listen as I read this quote you'll see
[36:40] it but is who are you now we are part of
[36:44] God
[36:49] you always was you don't remember it
[36:55] because you weren't only an attribute in
[36:58] God you were only in us thinking your
[37:02] very name if it ever was on the book of
[37:05] life it was there before the foundation
[37:06] of the world he knew who you were but
[37:10] Bream says I'm not saying this not to
[37:13] mix up doctrine but to straighten it out
[37:17] but we might get away from this fear and
[37:20] scare that you don't know who you are
[37:23] you're not going to be but you are now
[37:26] sons of God see you always were the sons
[37:31] of god let's pray Heavenly Father the
[37:38] Lord it's fill my lot tonight father but
[37:41] lord I ask Lord that you take control
[37:44] father lord I may be a vessel Lord that
[37:49] could be set aside for service Lord if
[37:52] they've come to hear me if you don't
[37:54] come Lord it's just dirt speaking to
[37:56] dirt that's all it is and Lord and they
[38:00] would leave this with human knowledge
[38:02] but Lord if you anointed if you anoint
[38:05] me Lord in this brother JD was back
[38:08] there tell me Lord while ago with just
[38:10] everybody in here had a desire to be
[38:13] anointed when the word goes forth or
[38:17] what a move we would have if everybody
[38:20] in here looks to hear from you and not
[38:22] from me if we perceive the father that
[38:25] this is that's not flesh that's God
[38:30] using man or this word would transform
[38:35] our lives lord I pray that you come to
[38:38] not meet every need father Lord you see
[38:41] the need of comfort Lord and Thomas
[38:44] sorrow for brother Don and brother Harry
[38:45] and his family father I pray that you
[38:47] would go there and our Lord give him the
[38:49] comfort and the peace father that only
[38:50] you could give touch each need here
[38:53] tonight father we thank you for Jesus
[38:55] name amen you can be seated
[39:00] if you'll give me a minute uh I want to
[39:03] give you a background on how I got this
[39:05] sermon I was telling brother Bradley
[39:07] brother JD back there well ago it I
[39:09] actually got this sermon out of the last
[39:11] one that I preached here several months
[39:13] ago when I was preaching it who had
[39:16] hindered you and when I was preaching
[39:19] ayah I was preaching about how we all
[39:24] realize you know we testify where we are
[39:27] of the bride we're the bride and when I
[39:30] was speaking there now remember how I
[39:33] related to finding your position finding
[39:35] out who you are in the bride not just
[39:37] not just realizing that your bride let's
[39:42] become a cliche in the message I'm part
[39:44] of the bride
[39:44] but God is is sent a message here to
[39:48] each individual to find out what your
[39:50] position in the bride in it and that
[39:51] really bared on my heart for a long time
[39:54] and you know when I get a thought as a
[39:57] minister of brother Terry some of these
[39:58] brothers will tell you that whenever you
[40:00] get a thought some of the talk it might
[40:01] be a thought of your own you think well
[40:03] I'd like to study on that but God will
[40:05] change it and then when God puts a
[40:07] thought in your heart it's totally
[40:09] different
[40:09] you can't get away from it you you just
[40:13] eat at you and I remember that thought
[40:15] who are you just kept coming back and
[40:17] coming back and I remember coming into
[40:18] service one night and I was like Lord if
[40:21] that thought that you give me I didn't
[40:23] even have a scripture for it just who
[40:26] are you brother Donny was preaching and
[40:29] in the middle of somewhere in the middle
[40:30] of the sermon he read acts 19 and before
[40:35] I came in I've been praying Lord just
[40:36] confirm that and when that scripture was
[40:38] read that just really sealed it in my
[40:40] heart and but Satan's job in this last
[40:44] day is to get you to not see who you
[40:46] really are get you out to fear put fear
[40:53] in your heart
[40:55] of what's laying before you what Satan
[40:58] and then when you when that fear comes
[40:59] out that blocks any revelation you have
[41:01] of finding out who you are and that
[41:04] Satan's job and while I was studying
[41:06] this and I was putting this down to the
[41:07] data I thought of the eagle in the
[41:09] chicken yard I don't know why that
[41:10] thought came to me and I just that eagle
[41:13] never really knew who he was he was in a
[41:16] chicken yard but he never realized who
[41:18] he was even when he her first heard the
[41:20] scream
[41:21] just when he heard the scream he didn't
[41:23] really realize yet who he was but he
[41:25] knew it was different that scream got
[41:29] him thinking but one is on the voice
[41:33] that led off the scream told him who he
[41:35] was then begin to realize I don't belong
[41:39] here
[41:39] if you ever realized who you are and you
[41:43] realize that you don't belong here
[41:44] you'll have a greater desire to get out
[41:46] that's when you'll see the bride begin
[41:49] to move you know and holy we identify
[41:52] ourselves people wide identify their
[41:54] selves with their homes their jobs their
[41:55] their families all that's good all
[41:58] that's good but God wants us to see past
[42:00] this flesh God wants us to see past who
[42:02] we are so how does God want how does God
[42:07] see for us who we really are how does he
[42:09] see us how does God look at us is he
[42:12] looking about Terry sits brother that's
[42:13] Terry Horne does God look at that way
[42:15] did you see that's Keith Phillips it's
[42:18] nowhere near the way God thinks there's
[42:21] nowhere near there was a thought that
[42:22] God had a view before the foundation of
[42:24] world and he still sees that thought he
[42:28] still sees he don't see the flesh but
[42:31] Brennan said in God the mystery in
[42:34] Christ mystery he made the statement
[42:36] that's where brother man made the
[42:37] statement of the bride recognize who she
[42:39] is
[42:40] she got here like I said we've made that
[42:41] a cliche we've identified with a body
[42:45] move instead of an individual and
[42:48] falling into place in this body that's
[42:52] my desire I'm glad I'm bright it tickles
[42:55] me to death that I'm a member of the
[42:56] bride but I've got to think past that
[43:00] I've got to find my position you've got
[43:03] to find your position in the bride so
[43:05] when brother Branham was saying that
[43:07] we've got to get past that fear that you
[43:10] don't know who you are how you going to
[43:13] get it people get stuck on I'm the bride
[43:19] and then they go on with their life I'm
[43:22] the bride and they're going through life
[43:24] there's nothing greater than being the
[43:27] bride but finding your position in the
[43:31] brothel in future home brother Branham
[43:34] says the future in the future home of
[43:36] the heavenly bridegroom an earthly bride
[43:38] if you are the bride and the bride is
[43:40] part of the husband the only place
[43:43] you'll ever recognize is recognized what
[43:46] part of that husband that word you are
[43:49] you can't recognize being the bride or
[43:52] you can't recognize being the bride you
[43:53] have to recognize your position your
[43:57] position is different than mine
[43:59] everybody's walk is different
[44:02] everybody's walk is by the word with
[44:04] everybody's walk is different you got to
[44:07] walk in the place that God puts you when
[44:10] I was preaching here before on a
[44:12] football team you can't be alignment and
[44:15] decide you want to play quarterback it
[44:18] don't work that way you're gonna be
[44:21] moving out of position you're gonna
[44:23] cause your team to lose what if we get
[44:27] to the place and we all get stuck on I'm
[44:31] in the bride and then we go by our daily
[44:33] lives
[44:34] nobody tries to find their position
[44:37] we're from nobody tries to find their
[44:41] position in the bride to find out what
[44:43] God wants for them to do this I was
[44:48] telling brother Walt earlier this
[44:50] message right here has spoke to me more
[44:51] than any message that I've ever heard
[44:53] that I've ever preached compared to some
[44:55] some brothers I haven't preached a lot
[44:57] but but this right here has got me a
[45:00] greater desire to see Who I am
[45:04] see Who I am in Christ when I see myself
[45:06] different I'm gonna see you different
[45:08] when I see what God wants for me my life
[45:12] can shine a little different for you and
[45:14] in a and I pray that we could all see
[45:18] that way it's not enough to say that you
[45:24] know God it's not enough to say God
[45:27] knows you God's desires that you know
[45:30] God in you in yourself it's wonderful to
[45:35] know God but if you don't know who you
[45:37] are what if God put you in a trial what
[45:40] if you got a test coming your way and
[45:41] you don't realize what God has made you
[45:44] God has made you more than conquer God
[45:46] has made you an overcomer he's made you
[45:48] able to be overcome anything that comes
[45:49] your way and yet you can't recognize it
[45:51] you can't recognize the tools that God
[45:54] gave you for that you can't recognize
[45:55] the power that you have in the word
[45:57] because you fail to see your possess and
[45:59] in the bride it could be that one little
[46:03] thing that keeps us from overcoming our
[46:05] trials we get so burdened down because
[46:08] we go through trial after trial after
[46:10] trial and we think it's this huge sin in
[46:12] your life you think it's something major
[46:14] the devil beat you beat you and all it
[46:16] is is you recognizing your position yeah
[46:18] all it is is a little revelation that
[46:20] God gives you this is who I made you
[46:22] this is who I want you to be all I want
[46:25] from you is for you to see it it's just
[46:29] it's just one little thing and it's in
[46:32] it's Satan trying to blind you Satan
[46:34] knows that he is not going to tell you
[46:35] that you're not bribed he's not gonna
[46:38] tell you this word is wrong because he
[46:40] you can always take Satan back to the
[46:42] place where you got saved where you got
[46:45] the Holy Ghost so he's not going to tell
[46:47] you what you believe in is a lie he's
[46:49] not gonna tell you that God's not real
[46:51] all he has to do is blind you to who you
[46:54] really are
[46:56] if you go in the battle and you got a
[46:59] sword but you don't know how to use it
[47:01] you got a spear but you don't you don't
[47:03] know how to use it you got a shield you
[47:05] got all the armor I preached this sermon
[47:08] a few years ago
[47:09] are you an overcomer you got all this
[47:13] armor that God gave you you're loaded
[47:15] down with armor but you don't know how
[47:18] to use it
[47:21] what if you're in the military a lot of
[47:23] y'all in the military they handed you a
[47:25] gun handed you a bunch of bullets said
[47:28] skip boot camp we need to hurry up and
[47:29] get you over there you don't know what
[47:33] to do you could have no idea what to do
[47:37] you're putting totally in front of the
[47:38] enemy without anybody telling you who
[47:40] you are what you're supposed to be doing
[47:43] and how to use what you got don't
[47:48] realize the power we have as the bride
[47:51] more read you a quote here minute well
[47:54] brother Bantam said the power that you
[47:55] have I've never read it before but if we
[47:59] ever get to the point to realize as the
[48:02] Bride of Christ because we all believe
[48:04] everybody believes that the bride is
[48:07] Christ in flesh we're Christ in flesh so
[48:13] will not Christ in flesh do what Christ
[48:15] did when Christ was here before
[48:18] the same power that Godhead would not
[48:20] the brought half so why don't we use it
[48:25] why don't we see that we are God in
[48:27] flesh why can't we see that we are
[48:29] Christ in flesh it's a bridegroom
[48:33] working through the bra the bride it's a
[48:36] little it's it's a little thing of satan
[48:39] put the scales over your eyes you can't
[48:40] you look in the mirror and you can't see
[48:43] nothing it's a revelation and 61 brother
[48:47] Branham preached I made these words big
[48:50] and I still can't see him that's pretty
[48:53] bad 1:18 fawni big enough in 61 he
[48:57] preached the house well you're talking
[49:01] about Jupiter and Mars and these stars
[49:04] that you see now well my think think
[49:07] about a hundred he says 186,000 miles
[49:10] per second and take a hundred and twenty
[49:14] years by one second 186,000 and break it
[49:19] down to a hundred and twenty million
[49:21] years that's then what what do you got
[49:25] that's miles oh my it makes makes us
[49:28] feel like I mean you're just see he says
[49:34] and then beyond that just as many moons
[49:36] moon and stars that's past all that 100
[49:39] million years there's more behind that
[49:42] and he holds them with the power of his
[49:45] own word God holds it them with the
[49:49] power of his own word so what can you do
[49:55] you claim you have God you claim that's
[49:59] who you are a child of God that's what
[50:01] we're speaking of who are you you're a
[50:03] child of God you that's your testimony
[50:06] God holds them with the power of his own
[50:09] work and the very same thing that holds
[50:11] them is in you as a Christian
[50:14] see there you are Kareem says that's who
[50:18] you are if that if that ever came in
[50:23] revelation to every single member of
[50:26] this bride would be gone that's a
[50:30] revelation of who we are
[50:32] that's the bride getting revelation of
[50:34] who we she really is world would have no
[50:37] idea what to do with such power when I
[50:44] was when you got that much power and we
[50:48] hold it back you know we say this all
[50:51] the time when you get sick you run to
[50:53] the doctor you take a pill you do all
[50:56] this and you got problems in your life
[50:58] and financial problems instead of going
[51:01] to God you run the bank and all these
[51:03] kind of things you don't realize your
[51:06] brother branham the bible tells us you
[51:08] know come boldly before the throne come
[51:11] boldly look at Esther I might be off
[51:16] here but I've seriously don't think
[51:19] Esther even after she was made Queen
[51:21] realized who she was yet her pastor
[51:26] Mordecai had to tell her to go before
[51:28] the throne your people are being killed
[51:30] your people are gonna be murdered she
[51:32] know what to do
[51:33] Mordecai said go to the king but she
[51:38] still didn't come boldly she crawled up
[51:40] on her hands and knees that's her
[51:44] husband sitting there but when she
[51:47] realized who she was she did not I was
[51:52] thinking of sitting in the back while
[51:53] ago she did not make her request known
[51:56] yet what does she ask the Queen became
[51:58] for fellowship she said I want to
[52:02] fellowship with you I want to prepare a
[52:05] meal for you
[52:06] we're gonna get towards the end now you
[52:09] don't mean every time I preach I jump
[52:11] everywhere but we're gonna get into that
[52:13] fellowship part but she asked she asked
[52:16] the King for fellowship first as is the
[52:20] bride you know we realize for you I'm a
[52:22] child of God soon as you got a need it's
[52:24] ask ask ask ask ask ask this ask that
[52:27] everything you ask for everything gimme
[52:29] gimme gimme gimme
[52:31] do you ever give back do we ever give
[52:34] fellowship we can learn a small lesson
[52:36] from Esther here when you reach out the
[52:39] scepter to her
[52:39] she didn't say o Great King they're
[52:43] murdering my people can you go save him
[52:44] she said let me prepare you a meal let
[52:48] me serve you a little bit let me give
[52:51] you a little fellowship and she realized
[52:52] who she was and she knew that if she had
[52:55] fellowship with him she would get her
[52:58] request granted
[53:01] so realize if we could realize the power
[53:04] in us
[53:05] you're the Queen of Heaven why are you
[53:09] walking around with a long face why why
[53:10] we walk around defeat it all the time
[53:13] the Queen of Heaven and you think
[53:16] yourself insignificant you think down of
[53:20] yourself when you go down to pray do you
[53:23] say Laura I'm just pitiful I can't do
[53:28] nothing why would you tell God hey I'm
[53:32] your queen but I'm nothing who you are
[53:38] is a revelation
[53:42] who you are is a queen of heaven if you
[53:47] can see it I don't know about y'all but
[53:51] I'm tired of being here I hate this
[53:53] place
[53:54] and maybe maybe I might be the last one
[53:57] to get the revelation Who I am
[53:58] but but I pray this right here is
[54:00] hurrying me up I pray that God is
[54:03] talking to me through this that I can
[54:06] find out my position in my place and you
[54:09] tonight when you go home and tomorrow
[54:12] every day that you live I want to get
[54:16] out here so please pray for a revelation
[54:19] of your position that God will reveal to
[54:23] you if you don't want to leave that's
[54:25] fine I pray God gives you the revelation
[54:26] so I can
[54:29] [Applause]
[54:29] [Music]
[54:31] [Applause]
[54:35] you look at people in the world today
[54:36] they'll sell anything to have there's
[54:39] people that will give millions to go off
[54:41] on a journey I want to find myself won't
[54:44] find out who I really am they'll leave
[54:46] their wives their families their jobs
[54:48] have some psychiatrist get thousands of
[54:52] dollars to tell them who they are and in
[54:56] the end what are they dirty stinking
[54:58] rotten flesh that's all they're gonna
[55:01] find out no matter what some
[55:03] psychiatrist tells you some doctor know
[55:05] much how much money you spend if you're
[55:09] not looking right here you'll never find
[55:11] out who you are and I pray God reveals
[55:15] that to me we sing the song all the time
[55:17] Who am I and that's not what I'm
[55:20] preaching about tonight
[55:21] you know we preach about who am i and in
[55:24] regard to our worthiness to him or his I
[55:27] done dying grace to us it's not that
[55:32] it's about a position it's about who you
[55:36] really are
[55:37] there's a real you sitting here tonight
[55:39] there's a you and there's a real you and
[55:45] I can assure you if you're under this
[55:47] blood there's only one of you that God
[55:49] sees there's only one and God don't see
[55:53] the flesh he don't call us by our names
[55:58] he publishes by the name that he has for
[56:00] us he looks at us has he saw we look for
[56:05] the foundation of the world this is one
[56:10] of my favorite quotes in the entire
[56:11] Bible I mean the entire message brother
[56:15] Branham and 64 this was almost exactly a
[56:18] year before he passed in who do you say
[56:22] this is that's the way he was he was in
[56:27] the beginning by himself God dwelt alone
[56:30] with his thoughts he'll never do that
[56:33] again
[56:33] because his thoughts are being manifest
[56:37] and that's why we are right here this
[56:41] day that's why you're right here god
[56:46] fellowshipping with his thoughts so you
[56:51] are his thoughts being made manifest
[56:52] there you are
[56:54] so you by taking thought cannot add one
[56:57] cubit to your stature you cannot do this
[56:59] that or the other it's God that short
[57:01] mercy it's God all the father has given
[57:04] me will come to me and no man can come
[57:08] except my father draws him that settles
[57:10] it
[57:11] so it's God fellowshipping with his
[57:14] thoughts so tonight if you could ask
[57:17] yourself Who am I really
[57:22] Who am I who are you I hope this can
[57:30] shed a little light one of these quotes
[57:33] I don't know if I have it here or not
[57:34] brother branham said 10 million years
[57:36] before the foundation of the world you
[57:39] were with him you were in his thoughts
[57:41] and so God is sitting up there but the
[57:47] tairy he had a thought of you he thought
[57:49] in the minute that thought of brother
[57:52] Terry came to God's mind his heart begin
[57:54] to beat you'll never express the love
[57:59] just in a thought think the way God
[58:02] loved the thought of relative you'll
[58:04] never be able to express that love so
[58:07] the very minute the very second that God
[58:10] had a thought of brother Terry God
[58:12] desired fellowship with brother Terry
[58:15] and God says I'll do anything okay how
[58:19] long it takes I don't care what happens
[58:21] I'll do anything to have fellowship with
[58:23] brother Terry anything so brother Terry
[58:26] when God said let there be light
[58:28] you were his purpose you were the
[58:31] purpose that God said let there be light
[58:32] when God said let there be anything but
[58:40] the land form the skies brother Terry
[58:44] you were his purpose
[58:46] it was because of you he said let there
[58:48] be he said let there be man and there
[58:52] was man and Godzilla image why because
[58:54] brother Terry was his purpose and God
[58:58] began to speak and everything begin to
[59:01] form because God wanted fellowship with
[59:05] brother Terry God wanted fellowship with
[59:09] you and then man fail
[59:13] why did man fall because God wanted
[59:16] fellowship with brother Terry the fall
[59:20] did not take God by surprise he didn't
[59:24] say I need to rethink this I need to do
[59:26] something different
[59:28] the man failed because God says I want
[59:31] to fellowship with brother Terry and
[59:35] then God had that seed that kept on
[59:37] going through Adam through Seth on down
[59:41] the line
[59:42] why fellowship with brother Terry the
[59:49] seed comes on down through David on down
[59:51] into Bethlehem my son is born God's own
[59:57] son without sin God said I want those
[1:00:02] she brother Terry wanna kill him go to
[1:00:07] murder my own son so I can have
[1:00:09] fellowship but brother Terry I'm gonna
[1:00:12] murder him if that didn't happen mother
[1:00:18] Terry whenever he fell she would go you
[1:00:21] and I would never get fellowship with
[1:00:23] God so why would God do such drastic
[1:00:28] things something so terrible the
[1:00:36] fellowship
[1:00:37] that's all it was let's fellowship then
[1:00:43] one day a man and a woman met came
[1:00:45] together and they had a child it was
[1:00:51] brother Terry God's heart began to beat
[1:00:54] more but Terry was born he dropped the
[1:01:00] seed in there let me put a different way
[1:01:05] God dropped a part of himself in there
[1:01:11] you dropped a part of himself God will
[1:01:17] only have fellowship with himself so he
[1:01:21] knew the only way he was going to
[1:01:22] fellowship with brother Terry has put
[1:01:24] himself in him his first breath come God
[1:01:28] drops it in there and he watches him it
[1:01:32] lays in there God will never lose
[1:01:35] himself God will never lose himself
[1:01:40] and as brother Terry's life goes on to
[1:01:45] the school through military through
[1:01:48] denominations God's heart still beat you
[1:01:53] knows one day one day the deep is gonna
[1:01:58] call to the deep end brother Terry
[1:02:01] because that's who the real Terry is the
[1:02:07] real Terry was not Terry Horn God says
[1:02:10] I'm gonna stick it in this vessel that
[1:02:12] somebody named Terry Horn and I'm going
[1:02:14] to stick it in there and let us sit down
[1:02:16] there for a while never watch it but man
[1:02:21] I just kept God's like I can't wait I
[1:02:23] can't wait because that's who he really
[1:02:27] was
[1:02:28] God in flesh I always thought I'd do a
[1:02:34] woman of the whale I was reading the
[1:02:38] scripture the woman in the whale before
[1:02:40] Jesus was that the whale before she ever
[1:02:42] got there so she didn't come and Jesus
[1:02:46] think honey did went over here the whale
[1:02:48] the real water was already at the whale
[1:02:51] waiting on her when she got there she
[1:02:54] didn't have to wait on it you ain't got
[1:02:56] to go looking for God you you you can't
[1:02:59] say that the Holy Ghost that you got in
[1:03:02] your life that was but you received you
[1:03:04] went and God without the Holy Ghost you
[1:03:08] was tickled with what you were you were
[1:03:10] happy with the way you were there's many
[1:03:13] of you now look back and you probably
[1:03:14] had it a whole lot better off before you
[1:03:17] got that Holy Ghost before that this
[1:03:20] word was revealed to you you was light
[1:03:22] you liked your life you could say you
[1:03:24] didn't I'm gonna tell you I had a lot of
[1:03:26] fun I had a lot of fun before the Holy
[1:03:29] Ghost ever coming into my life I was
[1:03:31] raising the message but I had more fun
[1:03:33] when I was back slid
[1:03:35] I had more fun you can say what you want
[1:03:38] it wasn't the right kind of fun but I'm
[1:03:42] enjoying myself a whole lot more now we
[1:03:51] read this the mighty God invaded it
[1:03:53] before us by Bram said now what did this
[1:03:57] putting the old scripture with the
[1:03:59] experience that Jesus was given it was
[1:04:01] giving to her what did it it it made the
[1:04:04] Messiah and did you notice quickly her
[1:04:06] sins were forgiven because at the
[1:04:07] beginning she was redeemable because she
[1:04:10] was in God's thinking at the beginning
[1:04:11] she was redeemable the only way you'll
[1:04:15] ever be redeemable only way as if you
[1:04:19] were in his thoughts first you can't
[1:04:23] redeem something you didn't have God's
[1:04:26] redeeming what he already had so we
[1:04:32] redeemed her or brought her back when
[1:04:34] she's seen the expressed scripture
[1:04:36] manifested of Jehovah
[1:04:37] what he was what he is it reading her
[1:04:43] what is it
[1:04:45] what redeemed her what is it it was her
[1:04:51] position before the foundation of the
[1:04:54] world that's what it is that's the it in
[1:04:57] your life where you was in God's
[1:05:00] thinking before the foundation of the
[1:05:01] world that's what we redeemed her back
[1:05:04] but that's predestination I don't care
[1:05:07] how you look at it listen Jesus knew she
[1:05:11] was coming
[1:05:13] he knew she was coming it was impossible
[1:05:17] for her not to go to the whale that day
[1:05:19] don't care what she did where she went
[1:05:22] she was going to end up at the well at
[1:05:24] that time in your life
[1:05:29] if using God's talk before the
[1:05:31] foundation of the world it was
[1:05:34] impossible it's impossible for you not
[1:05:38] to have this here this work have this
[1:05:40] revert word revealed to you it's
[1:05:42] impossible for you not to get the Holy
[1:05:43] Ghost if you were in his thought then
[1:05:45] brother Branham said you will go back it
[1:05:57] was something that God had placed in her
[1:05:59] before the foundation of the world they
[1:06:01] don't matter where her life went the
[1:06:03] adultery sin wherever it god says I
[1:06:08] ain't looking at that well the Terry it
[1:06:10] didn't matter what she did the
[1:06:11] denominations it didn't matter what you
[1:06:13] did before it was who you are it's
[1:06:16] because of who you are is what you why
[1:06:18] you received your turn a lot and when I
[1:06:21] was reading this reading to me people
[1:06:26] can tell of some great and I'm not
[1:06:29] preaching this as a doctrine people can
[1:06:31] take it about predestination and make it
[1:06:33] a doctrine and that's fine I can only
[1:06:36] tell you how I see it and that's I'm
[1:06:39] gonna tell you how I see it it's as
[1:06:41] simple as I was young I was young when
[1:06:45] the first time we watched the feeling
[1:06:46] beat took halls to the deep and that's
[1:06:48] head of that little simple sermon the
[1:06:51] deep in God out they're calling it the
[1:06:53] deep in here because to me that that
[1:06:57] revealed predestination to me
[1:06:59] because I was saying the brother Terry
[1:07:01] had that seed place in his life that
[1:07:03] part of God placed in his life before
[1:07:06] the fountain before the foundation world
[1:07:08] when he took his first breath God
[1:07:09] dropped it in there and you could say
[1:07:13] you know I made it I went searching for
[1:07:18] God I went looking for God I made I made
[1:07:22] the decision to live this message listen
[1:07:26] people make a conscious effort every day
[1:07:28] to read their Bible they make a
[1:07:30] conscious effort to go to church they
[1:07:32] and it's all here they make a conscious
[1:07:35] effort to live a good moral life you
[1:07:40] cannot seek God unless there's a God in
[1:07:45] there to seek
[1:07:47] when brother Brian Priestley beep
[1:07:49] calling to the deep that portion that
[1:07:52] was placed in you without that you would
[1:07:55] have never responded
[1:07:57] you couldn't respond only God can
[1:07:59] respond back to God that's the way I see
[1:08:02] it you can you know if you disagree I'm
[1:08:05] not here to start a new doctrine I'm
[1:08:07] just telling you that's predestination
[1:08:09] how I see it it's to me that simple I
[1:08:13] never made a choice to be the bride I
[1:08:17] didn't make a choice to be Gary here son
[1:08:19] he was the one that was blessed
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:29] he messed up three times before he got
[1:08:32] me but but I didn't make a conscious
[1:08:40] effort to be his son his blood runs in
[1:08:44] my veins anything I can do but do about
[1:08:46] it
[1:08:47] you listen they can drain all my blood
[1:08:50] put somebody else's blood in me take DNA
[1:08:52] off on my scanner still gonna come up
[1:08:53] Gary here don't matter but I could have
[1:08:59] never I never made the choice you never
[1:09:03] made the choice
[1:09:06] if God has sealed you before the
[1:09:10] foundation of the world you can't say I
[1:09:13] don't wanna be right it'll never be your
[1:09:16] thoughts it'll never be in your soap and
[1:09:22] as I was reading that I I got to reading
[1:09:25] it x19 imagine being in them gentlemen's
[1:09:30] places the devil said it I don't know
[1:09:32] you what if you got up in the morning
[1:09:37] and that was like yes I get him again
[1:09:41] he's weak if he'll don't know who you
[1:09:47] are you're lacking something if God is
[1:09:51] in you he'll knows it hell is gonna know
[1:09:54] what
[1:09:54] Bebel is going to know what would you
[1:09:56] imagine those guys if Satan was to look
[1:10:01] at when they said we cast out these out
[1:10:03] in Jesus name in the name of Paul and
[1:10:06] that one says I don't know you I know
[1:10:10] who I'd rather hear that from God say I
[1:10:12] don't know you're Satan say I don't know
[1:10:13] you
[1:10:14] I guess most as bad as the other attack
[1:10:18] but imagine in your life not having the
[1:10:22] Holy Ghost and you go out and try to
[1:10:23] venture without authority because you've
[1:10:27] never gotten the revelation of who you
[1:10:29] are
[1:10:30] that's a scary thought
[1:10:35] but I want to all held into Who I am
[1:10:38] when all hell - to shape when I get up
[1:10:42] now I believe that for all of us you
[1:10:46] know how a lot of tremble when you get
[1:10:48] up hell out of wish you could sleep for
[1:10:51] 24 hours
[1:10:54] hey listen I think the child of God
[1:10:56] could fight the devil in his sleep come
[1:10:59] wait if you're asleep or awake because I
[1:11:04] say this job save this job just to keep
[1:11:06] you from seeing who you are if he can
[1:11:08] keep you convinced that's your nothing
[1:11:11] can keep you down discouraged
[1:11:16] hey those are blinders
[1:11:18] those are blinders and Satan puts on you
[1:11:20] if you can't see who you are if you
[1:11:22] can't see the word you can't see the
[1:11:23] your brother your sister he's doing his
[1:11:26] job he's doing his job he like I said
[1:11:29] earlier he's not gonna convince you this
[1:11:31] words not true he's not gonna convince
[1:11:33] you of that you never will but long as
[1:11:37] you don't see yourself in it he don't
[1:11:38] care how much of it you see he'll put
[1:11:46] things in your life I think I've said
[1:11:50] this here before
[1:11:51] last time I preached he'll put things in
[1:11:54] your life that's not seeing that becomes
[1:11:55] sin because you put it before God but
[1:12:00] your job could be sin your hobbies you
[1:12:04] sports your family your everyday life
[1:12:07] can hinder you from being the real you
[1:12:14] we never get a revelation we never get a
[1:12:18] revelation of who we are we're not
[1:12:21] asking for revelation we don't you ever
[1:12:23] wonder why to me when we come in here we
[1:12:27] sit down and don't matter who's
[1:12:28] preaching it's like I mean brother JD
[1:12:30] was talking before if people could come
[1:12:33] in sit down
[1:12:35] and thank God speaking to me tonight
[1:12:37] if God is speaking to me like but we got
[1:12:43] our favorite preachers I have a favorite
[1:12:45] God I'll have a favorite God he's here
[1:12:50] every time but when you when you don't
[1:12:56] come because your favorite preachers not
[1:12:59] here your actions are saying that God's
[1:13:03] not going to speak to that man
[1:13:06] that's your actions you would never say
[1:13:10] that nobody would ever say that hey
[1:13:12] listen I was tempos ad I believe in
[1:13:15] honesty I've been a Reagan out of time -
[1:13:18] I have I pray God forgives me for it but
[1:13:24] I have you know that's human nature
[1:13:28] that's human nature
[1:13:30] granted there's you do have I have
[1:13:33] favorite preachers I do I do
[1:13:37] I'm my wife's favorite feature - but
[1:13:45] I've never got to the point that I don't
[1:13:46] think I praise that I never get to the
[1:13:50] point to think God can't speak to that
[1:13:52] man
[1:13:54] because when we come in here each time
[1:13:57] we come over here God and God is using
[1:13:59] someone to pull the wrapper off who we
[1:14:02] really are we come when it comes down to
[1:14:06] the rapture it's gonna be all peeled
[1:14:08] away I was like brother Donnie preaching
[1:14:11] sometimes rapture is on it's happening
[1:14:13] you're the rapper is being pulled off
[1:14:15] this flesh is being pulled off who you
[1:14:17] really are is being revealed so why are
[1:14:21] we not getting it why are we not seeing
[1:14:24] it
[1:14:26] we've come three times a week
[1:14:29] are we not letting God pull the wrapper
[1:14:32] off
[1:14:33] are we not desiring Lord coming in
[1:14:38] prayerful praying and reading Lord show
[1:14:40] me show me more of myself show me more
[1:14:43] in this work because I know the more
[1:14:45] that gets peeled off of me the closer I
[1:14:47] am to the rapture but we come in we sit
[1:14:51] down we look around who's here what
[1:14:55] they're wearing service starts we create
[1:14:57] a side of the song leader we criticize
[1:15:00] special songs criticize the music the
[1:15:05] criticizes the preacher by the time the
[1:15:08] word comes out we've done criticized it
[1:15:12] everything that we is going to get away
[1:15:17] how do you expect God to speak to you
[1:15:21] when you've sitting there with a
[1:15:21] critical spirit about town the minister
[1:15:23] comes up
[1:15:25] listen I don't know I know brother I
[1:15:35] love preaching brother Jean taro is here
[1:15:37] brother Jean we'll pull you out of your
[1:15:39] shoes Oh auntie brother Terry hey hey
[1:15:41] pulls butt and there are certain people
[1:15:43] that you could you feel pull when you
[1:15:45] preach and there's some that push
[1:15:50] there's some that push and it's it's a
[1:15:55] push-pull battle if we can get everybody
[1:16:00] me included when the ministers up here
[1:16:04] brother Donny's other brother Terry
[1:16:05] brother Darrell brother Davey pull them
[1:16:07] what hey I want to see more of myself I
[1:16:09] want more myself revealed to me and
[1:16:11] that's what I'm coming for I'm not
[1:16:14] coming to here man
[1:16:15] man will do me no good and that's what I
[1:16:20] desire and what's that's what I longed
[1:16:22] for when you realize who you are there's
[1:16:28] nothing there's nothing that Satan can
[1:16:32] bring against you you can't overcome
[1:16:33] there's not a thing
[1:16:36] listen this is a temporary dwelling
[1:16:38] place that's temporary
[1:16:40] you were dropped you were interned in
[1:16:42] eternity in the thoughts of God before
[1:16:47] the foundation of the world and God
[1:16:48] dropped you down in just a little bit of
[1:16:50] time but when he dropped you down in
[1:16:53] time he dropped a part of himself in you
[1:16:55] and you go through time as you go
[1:16:58] through time the rapper starts being
[1:17:00] pulled off and pull it off and pull it
[1:17:02] off each time you get into the word it
[1:17:03] gets pulled off to the point to where
[1:17:06] it's gonna be pulled all the way off and
[1:17:08] you're going back into eternity that's
[1:17:11] that's where I want to find myself I
[1:17:13] want to be able to look in the word and
[1:17:15] say the rappers coming off me I can see
[1:17:18] it I know there's still some on me
[1:17:19] there's still so on but it's coming off
[1:17:24] the God wants God wants to bless us more
[1:17:27] than we we want to be blessed listen
[1:17:31] whenever we go through trials
[1:17:34] temptations you know what was he called
[1:17:37] why why do you mind you putting this on
[1:17:39] me I'm supposed to be a child of God
[1:17:41] that's why he's giving it to you that's
[1:17:45] why you go through trials God God don't
[1:17:48] bless you for being good God don't bless
[1:17:51] you because you had a good week and you
[1:17:53] overcome and not that's not God's
[1:17:55] purpose God blesses you because of who
[1:17:58] you are he blesses you he gives you that
[1:18:01] he delivered you He healed you because
[1:18:03] of who you are your blessings don't
[1:18:07] you're a good boy here's some candy you
[1:18:09] did good God's mine don't work that way
[1:18:12] but you go through tests and trials
[1:18:14] tribulations because of who you are but
[1:18:19] Bram said he'll never never give you
[1:18:21] more than you can bear and he gives you
[1:18:23] a trial because he trusts you why would
[1:18:25] God trust you with the trial he knows
[1:18:28] that's him inside you it's impossible
[1:18:31] for God not to get their trial but so
[1:18:35] many times we we suppress the real us we
[1:18:39] suppress the real us and we can't get
[1:18:42] through it we try to get food on their
[1:18:44] own that's like getting through the
[1:18:46] service sometimes you haven't eaten a
[1:18:47] service and then you try to get through
[1:18:50] and his devil just bogging you down
[1:18:52] he's bogging you down and you want to
[1:18:54] get through that's his job because he
[1:18:58] knows God's God's gonna bless you
[1:19:08] so I was saying he delivers you because
[1:19:11] of who you are he heals you even when
[1:19:14] you come down to death when death counts
[1:19:18] because of who you are death can only do
[1:19:21] one thing can only do one thing and that
[1:19:24] is take you right back to where you were
[1:19:27] where you were before and that's because
[1:19:29] of who you are and I want to say this is
[1:19:34] like I sell brother about brother Terry
[1:19:37] it's God's desires fellowship not too
[1:19:43] long ago when brother Donny was
[1:19:44] preaching I was sitting in the back
[1:19:47] Bella Donna you was just wrapping up the
[1:19:50] end of a sermon and I was thinking Lord
[1:19:52] why would you give me eternal life why
[1:19:56] me why eternal life I'm sure everybody's
[1:20:02] probably asked that question of
[1:20:03] themselves why why eternal life why
[1:20:06] would you give it to me
[1:20:08] and both Donny had everybody staying and
[1:20:11] when I stood I've never heard a voice
[1:20:13] speak to me and I didn't that not never
[1:20:16] had a voice speak to me but something as
[1:20:19] loud of a voice as loud as a voice in my
[1:20:21] heart said he never wants the fellowship
[1:20:24] to end it's not but he's gonna give you
[1:20:30] eternal life because you were good here
[1:20:32] on earth everything good about you is
[1:20:35] him anyway
[1:20:37] everything that you are anything that
[1:20:39] you've done how you treated each other
[1:20:41] it's him anyway so what was the first
[1:20:45] thought that God had of you in the
[1:20:47] beginning fellowship it was all about
[1:20:51] fellowship but Bram said it fellowship
[1:20:54] by Redemption when our body comes in
[1:20:58] tune with God became a part of him then
[1:21:00] our soul can pick up the power of the
[1:21:01] Holy Spirit to vindicate the presence of
[1:21:04] the Lord Jesus Christ in all of his
[1:21:07] power and omnipotent he has risen from
[1:21:09] the dead he lives among us today and he
[1:21:12] wants fellowship back with his people
[1:21:13] again his great Majesty his glory is now
[1:21:17] spreading forth and he's designed to
[1:21:19] fellowship with his people again like he
[1:21:21] did in the Garden of Eden father and his
[1:21:25] son fathering a daughter
[1:21:26] there's our fellowship but you can't
[1:21:29] have that fellowship without love
[1:21:31] it requires love fellowship requires
[1:21:33] love because if somebody wants you to
[1:21:36] fellowship you gotta ought against that
[1:21:38] brother and you go fellowship with him
[1:21:39] there's gonna be some tension yeah
[1:21:41] that's just the way it is it's
[1:21:43] uncomfortable God that God don't want
[1:21:46] that between you and him
[1:21:48] God wants to fellowship with that part
[1:21:50] of you that he put there before the
[1:21:52] foundation of the world that's the only
[1:21:54] thing he wants to fellowship with he
[1:21:55] don't want fellowship with his flesh why
[1:21:59] do you think Christ came and died and
[1:22:01] took all your sins took all your sins
[1:22:05] took him right back to hell
[1:22:06] why because through the blood the only
[1:22:11] way God can put himself in you is for
[1:22:14] you that soul to be sinless he will
[1:22:18] never dwell in a sinful being that is
[1:22:23] sin God won't touch sin that's why he
[1:22:30] took your sins put him on the sacrifice
[1:22:34] and that's what God wants to fellowship
[1:22:36] with that was his desire but there is to
[1:22:40] put it in you so we could fellowship
[1:22:42] with it so as we look down through time
[1:22:44] everything he done from 10 million years
[1:22:47] before the foundation of the world
[1:22:50] everything he'd done had a purpose you
[1:22:55] look at down through the ages the bride
[1:22:58] there's gonna be millions and millions
[1:22:59] and millions of people millions and God
[1:23:05] had that same desire same thought for
[1:23:08] each individual every individual did he
[1:23:11] not think a less of one than he did the
[1:23:13] other and it requires love but that love
[1:23:18] needs to be reciprocated back and if
[1:23:21] God's in you it will because only God
[1:23:24] can reciprocate love back to God brother
[1:23:30] Branham said in the sixty and fellowship
[1:23:32] fellowship comes by love and love
[1:23:35] requires fellowship if you love your
[1:23:37] wife you've got to get with her and talk
[1:23:40] with her if you love your friend you've
[1:23:43] got to get with him and talk with him
[1:23:44] and if you love God there's got to be a
[1:23:47] basis for a fellowship you cannot have
[1:23:49] complete fellowship and livelihood
[1:23:52] without these agreements
[1:23:53] you can't fellowship with your wife your
[1:23:56] family your friends if there's not a
[1:23:59] kindred spirit there
[1:24:02] there's love you love your wife you love
[1:24:04] your kids
[1:24:05] let me tell ya I don't like hanging
[1:24:07] around people I don't like
[1:24:10] that's just everyone could say actors
[1:24:13] there's people you don't like I love
[1:24:15] everybody and I'm sure there's a lot of
[1:24:17] people who don't like me but that's life
[1:24:21] and that that's what he's saying that
[1:24:23] you got to have that that one element
[1:24:25] there for fellowship that's all God
[1:24:26] requires that fellowship is the God in
[1:24:28] you so he can fellowship just I don't
[1:24:31] know how simple to make that but it's
[1:24:33] God in you God fellowshipping with God
[1:24:36] in you if you want to really understand
[1:24:40] see that clear go back watch the deep
[1:24:41] cause of the deep as to me the most
[1:24:43] simple simple is it could be made whilst
[1:24:48] my spot you cannot be married without an
[1:24:51] agreement you cannot have a wife without
[1:24:53] some kind of agreement and that
[1:24:54] agreement is based upon your vow you
[1:24:56] cannot have fellowship with God without
[1:24:58] coming to God's agreement and there's a
[1:25:01] basic thing for fellowship and that's
[1:25:03] the blood the blood only it's been God's
[1:25:05] Way from the beginning and it will be
[1:25:07] till the end the only place of
[1:25:10] fellowship is through the blood without
[1:25:13] that blood without the blood God
[1:25:15] couldn't have placed himself in you he
[1:25:18] couldn't he couldn't have done it
[1:25:19] I always thought of that you know to me
[1:25:25] when the quote where brother branham
[1:25:28] said that god murdered his son I always
[1:25:31] thought he needed you take a man that's
[1:25:35] got a son an only son
[1:25:38] say brother Harry Justin's his only son
[1:25:41] I know brother here he loves me he's my
[1:25:43] buddy no he loves me he'd never kill his
[1:25:47] son for me he could never he would never
[1:25:52] be able to feel that love so when you
[1:25:55] look back and you look at God
[1:25:58] you know God loved Jesus loved him it
[1:26:03] says only Son there were he without sin
[1:26:09] and God took the only thing in the world
[1:26:11] without seeing killed it the only thing
[1:26:15] that was pure to save the dirtiest thing
[1:26:19] there was how does that make sense and
[1:26:27] it all was for fellowship fellowship
[1:26:32] with us so when you look at what does
[1:26:36] God want why is God gonna rapture us all
[1:26:38] up to heaven the bride's gonna come in
[1:26:41] he just wants fellowship God said I had
[1:26:44] a thought of you before the foundation
[1:26:46] of the world but when I had that thought
[1:26:48] of you my heart about beat out of my
[1:26:51] chest and the only way I can have
[1:26:55] fellowship with you one is for you to
[1:26:58] see who you really are and that's me in
[1:27:01] you and I pray that we we see that any
[1:27:05] like I said I don't want to be here no
[1:27:08] more this world is gone
[1:27:11] there ain't no President and ever it's
[1:27:14] gonna save it during a congress there's
[1:27:17] not a Senate there's nothing that's
[1:27:19] gonna save this place and I don't want
[1:27:21] to be here I don't care how much better
[1:27:22] they say it's gonna be it's it's over
[1:27:26] and I'm ready to get out of here when we
[1:27:38] get to the point that we begin to see
[1:27:42] the God in us I really believe will have
[1:27:45] a higher know how to put it
[1:27:50] opinion of ourselves we won't put
[1:27:55] ourselves down so much you think God
[1:27:57] sits up in heaven and thinks then poor
[1:28:00] insignificant people them unworthy
[1:28:05] people I think God's proud of you
[1:28:09] I think God is shows you off everybody's
[1:28:14] gonna have a joke moment in more ways
[1:28:18] than one there's gonna be a time when
[1:28:21] God tells Satan have you considered
[1:28:24] brother Tim Mullins we hate those only
[1:28:28] brother Tim you consider brother Keith I
[1:28:33] don't want one of their moments but
[1:28:35] you're gonna get it
[1:28:37] have you considered my daughter my son
[1:28:41] have you considered him why would God do
[1:28:44] that because he's proud of you he was
[1:28:49] proud of Joe he wanted to show Satan
[1:28:51] what he could do we've we were all like
[1:28:53] that we're that way naturally when we
[1:28:56] have a son or a daughter we want to show
[1:29:00] them off you want to show them off
[1:29:03] that's just our human nature I love
[1:29:08] watching my kids play ball loved it
[1:29:11] still do that's my hobby that and
[1:29:16] getting beat by Joel golf those are my
[1:29:18] hobbies I played for second place all
[1:29:23] the time
[1:29:28] but I'm proud of them
[1:29:30] because they're they're mine those are
[1:29:34] my kids and they have me and they're
[1:29:36] inside of them and I want to show them
[1:29:39] off when my youngest just passed
[1:29:45] football year kicked the winning field
[1:29:46] goal over here at Hampton I had more
[1:29:50] people come up to me congratulating me
[1:29:57] now I was beside myself but I had people
[1:30:03] coming up to me congratulate me and I
[1:30:07] went home later that night thinking
[1:30:08] about that he's the one that done it but
[1:30:15] then got to thinking when I was studying
[1:30:17] this it's because who he was
[1:30:23] listen when you fall and you get up just
[1:30:28] to gettin up there celebration going on
[1:30:30] in heaven there's high-fives going on in
[1:30:33] heaven because you overcome something
[1:30:35] you want something when you win a battle
[1:30:40] when you overcome a test I don't believe
[1:30:42] I don't believe gods like well it's
[1:30:44] about time I say that to myself
[1:30:50] sometimes but I don't believe God says
[1:30:52] it's about Tom I think he's proud and I
[1:30:57] don't mean this in a carnal way but I'd
[1:31:00] say angels are giving God some high
[1:31:01] fives because why because of who you are
[1:31:05] they know heaven knows that God is in
[1:31:08] you heaven knows who you really are how
[1:31:10] they gonna know where to put you in the
[1:31:11] table if they don't know who you are
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:16] it's God in you God loves us all the
[1:31:22] same I don't think that God gives more
[1:31:26] love to a pastor a preacher than he does
[1:31:27] to a little kid out here I don't believe
[1:31:32] that I believe when a pastor or preacher
[1:31:35] minister an adult it's on their knees
[1:31:39] crying out to God for a need in the
[1:31:41] family I believe God's silence is heaven
[1:31:43] I believe that with all my heart but you
[1:31:47] take a twelve-year-old girl on the bus
[1:31:52] ride to school saying god I got a test
[1:31:56] today God will silence him her prayer
[1:32:03] it's no less than any other child of God
[1:32:08] her need is no less God don't look at
[1:32:14] levels of needs because he can do
[1:32:16] anything if we could get to the point
[1:32:22] I'm closer if we could get to the point
[1:32:26] to realize what God wants us to see in
[1:32:31] ourselves instead of sticking with the
[1:32:34] old tradition I'm the Bride of Christ
[1:32:37] and that's I don't mean to slight that
[1:32:39] in any way whatsoever call that a
[1:32:41] tradition but we get that way we get
[1:32:44] settled we get settled saying I'm the
[1:32:47] bride of christ on the Bride of Christ
[1:32:49] well is that something you heard or has
[1:32:51] it been revealed to you because if it
[1:32:52] ever revealed to you you're gonna know
[1:32:54] your position in the bride you're gonna
[1:32:57] know what God's design your life is and

[1:52:49] a real thought and revelation tonight

[1:52:56] place we're not just anybody worthy
[1:52:58] bride surely he said yes that's just a
[1:53:00] cliche but I am part of the kingdom of
[1:53:03] God I am a son of God I was with him

[1:53:08] eternally in this sauce I'm gonna be

[1:53:15] the rapture it's gonna take more faith
[1:53:17] in any because côté trapped in faith but
[1:53:19] he's given he said he gets supreme grace

[1:53:23] Nita for the Raptors in that sea that's
[1:53:25] going to be there but we need to
[1:53:27] cultivate it and recognize true who we
[1:53:29] are Perry's gonna sing as we close I
[1:53:31] said you know I'm still amazed I'm still
[1:53:34] amazed how much God loves me we think
[1:53:36] about I'm just amazed but yet it's true
[1:53:39] this little story comes to my mind I
[1:53:42] think I told her one here one time here
[1:53:43] years ago really what one person says we
[1:53:46] are that's really not we are but really
[1:53:48] some at some point time there's got to
[1:53:50] be a declaration who we really are
[1:53:53] there was a man his true story in iris
[1:53:56] in Ireland and he was caught stealing
[1:53:59] sheep and so one of the vector two three
[1:54:03] hundred years ago and so when they
[1:54:05] caught them what they did they branded
[1:54:08] them on the forehead with a hot iron st
[1:54:11] sheep thief and so that was his
[1:54:14] punishment being a sheep thief and he
[1:54:16] had to go for years of well the rest his
[1:54:19] life because he was branded permanently
[1:54:21] so was it too long after that the man
[1:54:24] got saved lived in the same community is
[1:54:27] where he stole the Sheep changed his
[1:54:29] whole life he got saved lived many many
[1:54:32] years of a real real Christian life in
[1:54:35] that same community and finally one of
[1:54:37] the magistrates that somebody said
[1:54:39] that's not right that's not right that
[1:54:41] man bears out that that stigma of st
[1:54:45] sheep thief for all those years he's not
[1:54:47] a sheep thief he did that many many
[1:54:49] years ago so he held up town council if
[1:54:52] you
[1:54:52] we'll and call it everybody in the
[1:54:54] little town together safe I'm gonna make
[1:54:56] a declaration day that st on his
[1:54:59] forehead it don't stand for sheep thief
[1:55:01] anymore
[1:55:01] it stands for saint he made a
[1:55:05] declaration of who that man really was
[1:55:09] no wonder the prophet of God in the
[1:55:11] first seal could say I'm not going to
[1:55:13] call you Church I'm gonna call you bride
[1:55:15] he's making a declaration of who we are
[1:55:18] but we've got to accept that and
[1:55:19] realized that's really who we are
[1:55:21] because his whole ministry was come out
