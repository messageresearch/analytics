[41:12] a few weeks later he called me again
[41:15] must need i know i needed the prayers
[41:17] but he said brother marcus he says i
[41:19] used to do a lot of singing and
[41:21] he said i'd like you to get my cds and
[41:24] sing one of my songs one night
[41:27] so i wanted to make that little comment
[41:29] so you know why i'm singing this it's
[41:31] for brother jack and i know he's not
[41:33] here but
[41:34] i'm pretty sure he's
[41:36] tuned in
[41:38] god bless you brother
[41:40] one other thing i
[41:41] when i got the cds
[41:44] there's four of them and there was a
[41:45] title jumped right out and
[41:47] it was obvious what i was going to sing
[41:49] i
[41:50] shortly after my son
[41:52] the lord took him home
[41:55] i had an experience where i felt him
[41:57] speak to my heart dad served the lord
[42:00] and it happened twice he spoke to my
[42:02] heart
[42:03] so that's the song born to serve the
[42:05] lord
[42:09] from the dust
[42:11] of the earth
[42:14] my god
[42:17] created man
[42:20] and his breath
[42:22] it made man
[42:25] a living soul
[42:30] for
[42:32] god
[42:33] so loved the world
[42:36] that he gave
[42:38] his only son
[42:42] and that
[42:44] that is why
[42:46] i love him so
[42:52] for i was made
[42:55] in his likeness
[42:58] and created
[43:01] in his image
[43:16] i can't deny him
[43:19] oh
[43:20] i always
[43:22] walk beside you
[43:26] i
[43:27] i

[43:30] to serve the lord
[43:34] [Music]
[43:35] oh my hands
[43:38] they
[43:39] were made
[43:41] for
[43:42] to help
[43:44] help my neighbor
[43:46] and my
[43:49] eyes were made
[43:52] to read god's word
[43:56] oh
[43:57] and my feet
[44:00] they were made
[44:03] just to walk
[44:06] in his footsteps
[44:08] and
[44:09] my body
[44:11] oh it's the temple
[44:13] temple of the lord lift your hands about

[44:51] for
[44:52] i

[51:34] sickness all kinds of stuff going on
[51:37] russia just said

[52:14] i read the other day that bomb shelters
[52:17] uh certain kinds of them the sale of
[52:19] them it went up 400 percent
[52:21] and i thought i wonder how many of them
[52:23] people have actually found the right one
[52:26] so they're digging down in the holes and
[52:28] the concrete and all that sort of thing
[52:31] once in things drop if there's anything

[52:44] amen i'm glad we're there tonight by the
[52:47] grace of god
[52:49] let's um turn to now if you would the
[52:50] book of revelation chapter five
[52:53] i'd also like to say
[52:54] unto you from harry and
[52:57] myself and our families who certainly
[52:58] appreciate your
[53:00] prayers and
[53:02] cards text emails phone calls
[53:04] condolences things like that for the
[53:06] passing of our sister cheryl her service
[53:10] will be
[53:11] this saturday evening down in kentucky
[53:13] so
[53:14] i won't be able to be with you on sunday
[53:16] because we'll
[53:17] be down there but we certainly do
[53:19] appreciate it so much
[53:21] and also i want to remind you about the
[53:23] prayer line lord we'll be having here
[53:25] on the 12th of june we'll plan on
[53:28] starting service a little later in the
[53:30] day probably two o'clock something like
[53:32] that
[53:33] um
[53:34] been hearing of different people coming
[53:36] from different places all over different
[53:38] parts of the states got an email today
[53:41] from somebody that was from norway that
[53:43] was planning on coming
[53:46] with expectation like that
[53:48] there ain't no telling what will happen
[53:52] amen
[53:54] right we get what we expect so we come
[53:57] and just trust in the lord to move for
[54:00] us and move with us um as many of you
[54:02] know erica had
[54:04] a pet scan done uh on friday and went to
[54:07] the doctor today to get the report and
[54:10] i'll spare you all the
[54:12] doctor terminology but there was no bad
[54:16] report thank the lord
[54:18] the situation that she's dealing with in
[54:20] her liver has changed somewhat the
[54:23] growth itself
[54:25] and it's made it to word that she is a a
[54:27] candidate for a different type of
[54:30] treatment which she'll have to go to
[54:32] nashville to be able to get
[54:34] and in simple layman's terms it would
[54:37] it's a it's a it's a
[54:39] very powerful type of thing but they've
[54:42] had really great success with it and if
[54:45] that's god's way of doing it that's fine
[54:47] my preference would be he just let her
[54:49] come through the prayer line in a week
[54:50] or so and poop it's all gone yeah
[54:53] that'd be my preference
[54:55] but i found out a long time ago he does
[54:56] very little according to my preference
[54:58] so
[54:59] just whatever his will is and his reason
[55:01] for doing it we will take it that way
[55:04] but what they want to give her is a
[55:06] liquid radiation they will put it in her
[55:09] body by
[55:10] iv
[55:11] and once this thing
[55:13] develops into this stage where it is it
[55:16] puts out a certain thing and this
[55:18] radiation hones in
[55:20] on this and goes straight to those
[55:23] particular things in her body supposedly
[55:26] doesn't harm
[55:27] other parts of the body and i just said
[55:29] devil
[55:31] you're in the target
[55:33] you know devils do that
[55:35] devils are actually quite dumb
[55:38] in some instances
[55:40] they will do things i'll tell you why
[55:41] they do it they get afraid
[55:44] they get afraid i've seen it in casting
[55:46] devils out of people before and i watch
[55:48] for the spirit of god but also watch and
[55:52] wait for that devil to make a mistake
[55:55] because they get afraid they get so
[55:58] nervous remember the prophet whenever he
[56:00] would call people out and tell him you
[56:01] got cancer and said right back there
[56:03] there's another person got one rival
[56:04] there's another one can you imagine when
[56:07] they got back down in hell how they
[56:09] argued and fussed you know what this
[56:11] doing they got afraid
[56:13] they were scared
[56:14] and they told on one another
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] so you put the pressure on them and they
[56:21] sure will get nervous and scared
[56:24] so we're just believing the lord so we
[56:26] appreciate your prayers for him just
[56:28] wanted to share that with you
[56:30] let's read revelation chapter five
[56:33] verse five
[56:36] glad to have brother aaron such a lady
[56:37] and their family visiting with us
[56:39] tonight god bless you all
[56:42] and one of the elders says unto me
[56:45] weep not behold the line
[56:47] of the tribe
[56:49] of judah
[56:50] the root of david
[56:52] haths prevailed to open the book
[56:55] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[56:58] i beheld and lo
[57:00] in the midst of the throne
[57:02] and of the four beasts in the midst
[57:05] of the elders
[57:06] stood a lamb as it had been slain
[57:10] having
[57:11] seven horns and seven eyes
[57:14] which are the seven spirits of god
[57:17] sent forth
[57:18] into all the earth now it's not of
[57:20] course that god has
[57:22] seven holy ghosts or seven uh spirits
[57:25] from himself but the seven dispensations
[57:27] of his spirit
[57:29] and he came and took the book
[57:31] out of the right hand
[57:33] of him that set upon the throne
[57:36] and when he had taken the book the four
[57:38] beasts four and twenty elders fell down
[57:41] before the lamb
[57:43] having
[57:44] every one of them harps
[57:46] and golden vials
[57:48] full of odors
[57:53] so i ask you
[57:54] should you pray
[57:59] look what prayers are
[58:02] every one of them having harps
[58:04] and golden vials
[58:07] full of odors
[58:10] which are the prayers
[58:12] of the saints
[58:15] now what are they praying about of
[58:16] course redemption that's what this has
[58:18] to do with
[58:20] redemption so every one of them having
[58:23] harps
[58:24] and golden vowels
[58:26] full of voters why in the world would
[58:27] you have
[58:28] a vowel with saints prayers in it and
[58:31] you've got a harp
[58:33] which is associated with music well
[58:36] we'll find here a little bit later that
[58:38] they go to singing and they go to
[58:40] rejoicing and then a noise comes out of
[58:42] heaven
[58:43] when she goes up
[58:45] woe to the inhabiters of the earth for
[58:48] the devil has come down to you
[58:50] and he knows that he has
[58:52] but a short time
[58:54] the sparrow heads together he may like
[58:55] to be remembered before the lord tonight
[58:57] you have a need of requests on your
[58:58] heart
[59:00] lord jesus we counted such an honor
[59:03] father that we could be here tonight
[59:06] we love you so much
[59:08] you've been so good to us lord
[59:10] each of us i'm sure if we could
[59:13] testify just of what we know
[59:15] of all that you've done
[59:17] it would take us many many weeks and
[59:19] would never be able to really even
[59:21] scratch the surface i suppose
[59:24] that's just the things we know about
[59:26] much less the things that you've done
[59:28] all of our lives you've watched over us
[59:31] you've moved for us no doubt when we
[59:33] wasn't even aware of it we know that
[59:36] you're mindful
[59:38] and lord there's one thing that i've
[59:40] learned and i'm sure that many of these
[59:42] people have learned the same thing
[59:44] there's parts of your will i can't say
[59:47] that i understand
[59:49] there's parts of your will concerning my
[59:52] life maybe the lives of those that i
[59:54] love and the lives of those people that
[59:57] i try to shepherd
[59:59] that i look at and i ponder over it and
[1:00:01] i wonder about it and i think why
[1:00:04] wouldn't it been better to do this or
[1:00:06] that
[1:00:07] so when i cannot understand your will
[1:00:10] and sometimes your will might even
[1:00:12] frighten us somewhat
[1:00:14] i've learned to trust your heart
[1:00:18] because you've told us i know the
[1:00:20] thoughts that i think
[1:00:22] about you
[1:00:23] they are of love and of mercy or they
[1:00:26] have expounded from the book of jeremiah
[1:00:28] under the new testament of grace and
[1:00:30] pardon and forgiveness and all the
[1:00:32] things that you think about us they are
[1:00:35] thoughts of good and not of evil help us
[1:00:38] tonight i pray may your thoughts be
[1:00:40] further unveiled to us at this service
[1:00:42] and that we asked father in the name of
[1:00:44] the lord jesus
[1:00:46] and the saints said amen amen god bless
[1:00:48] you you may be seated
[1:00:53] give me a little bit more on the
[1:00:54] monastery brother josiah
[1:00:57] what we've read here tonight is
[1:01:02] the most sublime
[1:01:04] of all scriptures
[1:01:07] it's something that
[1:01:08] soul resounds from eternity
[1:01:12] many people read it read over it many
[1:01:15] people try to understand it try to
[1:01:18] perceive it
[1:01:20] because they approach it from the
[1:01:22] intellect of their mind
[1:01:24] they just attribute it to something
[1:01:27] that's
[1:01:28] not really to be understood
[1:01:30] not really to be comprehended
[1:01:33] but i beg to differ with that i don't
[1:01:35] believe it's placed here in god's word
[1:01:39] if it was not for us to understand it
[1:01:42] we know from these passages of scripture
[1:01:46] that it seems as if though
[1:01:48] that it would remain in mystery form i
[1:01:51] myself i'm not afraid of mysteries i
[1:01:54] don't mind hearing preachers preach
[1:01:56] mysteries but the kind of preacher i
[1:01:58] like to hear preach a mystery is
[1:02:00] whenever he takes a mystery and when he
[1:02:02] gets done with it it's no longer
[1:02:04] mysterious i have a hard time with the
[1:02:07] preacher who takes a mystery that's
[1:02:09] about this big whenever he gets done
[1:02:11] with as big as this church
[1:02:12] so you're trying to comprehend it you're
[1:02:14] trying to understand wow that is really
[1:02:17] a mystery but it doesn't really do you
[1:02:19] any good if it's not broken down and
[1:02:22] gives you something that you can be able
[1:02:23] to leave with in your heart
[1:02:26] now it seems as if though that john
[1:02:29] called up into this realm of vision and
[1:02:31] it's hard for us to know exactly when
[1:02:34] john is here on this isle of patmos what
[1:02:37] part was happening with him there
[1:02:40] remaining on the island and he was moved
[1:02:44] into the realm of vision which is the
[1:02:46] fourth dimension or was john actually
[1:02:50] caught up into those heavenly realms now
[1:02:54] we know that it happened so was was a
[1:02:56] prophet that was sent to us in our day
[1:02:58] it was also happened to moses it
[1:02:59] happened to different ones that god
[1:03:02] would allow them to remain say on samia
[1:03:05] or mount horeb wherever they were and
[1:03:07] they simply were moved into that realm
[1:03:11] by the realm of vision itself and then
[1:03:14] there were some as god told to moses i
[1:03:16] want you to build the tabernacle
[1:03:18] according to the pattern that was showed
[1:03:20] thee in the mount but then he later
[1:03:23] relates it that moses was actually
[1:03:26] carried up to be able to see something
[1:03:28] that was in heaven so whether john was
[1:03:31] actually in heaven when this happened or
[1:03:34] john was still in a body form
[1:03:37] but by vision in the fourth dimension he
[1:03:40] was carried up into this we know that it
[1:03:44] started unfolding itself
[1:03:46] chapter one chapter two chapter three
[1:03:49] chapter four but then when it comes to
[1:03:51] chapter five it's like the things change
[1:03:54] from the stage on the earth and john is
[1:03:57] carried up into heaven there he begins
[1:04:00] to see things that not even daniel or
[1:04:04] jeremiah had been able to see quite as
[1:04:07] clear and god wanted this to be able to
[1:04:11] be kept until the last days even john
[1:04:14] when he started to write some of the
[1:04:16] things that he heard he was told to
[1:04:18] don't write it because it's going to be
[1:04:20] revealed in the end time so he knows
[1:04:23] that god then has an allocation of time
[1:04:26] by which he will allow certain things to
[1:04:29] be said it will be looked over it'll be
[1:04:32] pondered about teachers will try to
[1:04:35] you'll be able to decipher it and say
[1:04:36] well it could be men's could be that
[1:04:38] could be something else but when god has
[1:04:41] a certain time frame on it it'll never
[1:04:43] really be broken into that time frame
[1:04:46] but we are living in the last day when
[1:04:48] it's going to be revealed
[1:04:50] now john had looked into this when he
[1:04:53] hears this great cry and it was the
[1:04:56] sound of one of the elders who is worthy
[1:04:59] to come and take the book well then the
[1:05:02] heavens was searched under the earth
[1:05:04] above the earth it was all searched
[1:05:06] nobody was found worthy john says i went
[1:05:08] much because no one was found worthy
[1:05:11] then john hears this voice don't we
[1:05:14] because the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:05:18] has prevailed so john no doubt expecting
[1:05:22] to look and see a lion but instead he
[1:05:26] sees a lamb now what a strange saying
[1:05:29] why didn't god just say well the lamb
[1:05:31] will do it because this person has many
[1:05:35] titles
[1:05:36] now why did not john already see him in
[1:05:40] the vision john had already saw into the
[1:05:43] realm of cherubims he had already saw
[1:05:46] into the realm of zooms which is a
[1:05:49] different type of angelic creature he
[1:05:52] had already saw into the rim of
[1:05:54] seraphims cherubims and zunes and he saw
[1:05:58] the person of god this bright light
[1:06:01] sitting upon the throne but he did not
[1:06:03] see the lamb why well the prophet tells
[1:06:06] us in the revelation series that the
[1:06:09] reason he did not see it because the
[1:06:11] lamb was hid in behind those four living
[1:06:16] creatures now they of course four is the
[1:06:19] number of earthly deliverance so those
[1:06:22] four creatures have something to do with
[1:06:25] god manifesting himself on the earth
[1:06:28] through these four anointings and we
[1:06:30] know in the old testament that there
[1:06:33] were 600 000 jews that built their
[1:06:37] dwelling their temporary dwelling place
[1:06:40] around the tabernacle of the old
[1:06:42] testament so they would have divided
[1:06:44] them according to the tribal banners and
[1:06:48] they would set under each of them
[1:06:50] gathered under their banner and then
[1:06:52] there would be one major banner on the
[1:06:55] north side the south side the east side
[1:06:58] and the west side then there would be
[1:07:00] sub-categories that would be gathered
[1:07:02] there what were they doing they were
[1:07:04] guarding the holy place and the
[1:07:07] tabernacle now when god come in the new
[1:07:10] testament then he no longer needed six
[1:07:14] hundred thousand jews but he still has
[1:07:17] four guards
[1:07:18] but they are not guarding the temple in
[1:07:21] the wilderness they're not guarding the
[1:07:23] tabernacle in heaven but they are
[1:07:26] guarding the book of acts
[1:07:28] so what do they do let's confer with
[1:07:32] matthew
[1:07:33] matthew you are a guard to guard the
[1:07:37] book of acts
[1:07:38] so matthew we're going to ask you
[1:07:41] tonight about water baptism
[1:07:44] we want you to tell us matthew
[1:07:48] you are the guard of the book of acts
[1:07:51] so what are you going to say matthew
[1:07:55] about water baptism
[1:07:59] go to this therefore unto all nations
[1:08:02] and make disciples of all nations
[1:08:05] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:08:08] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[1:08:12] so here is the guard to the book of acts
[1:08:16] now we'll get into it a little bit later
[1:08:18] but the lord jesus had
[1:08:20] dispensational claims son of god son of
[1:08:24] david son of man he was the heir to the
[1:08:28] royal grant he was the son of man in
[1:08:32] that he come to the earth also to be the
[1:08:35] son of god and the son of david in the
[1:08:38] millennium so matthew stands there
[1:08:42] now the lord jesus could have plainly
[1:08:45] said as he did in luke 24 49 that go and
[1:08:49] teach remission and repentance of sins
[1:08:52] and remission of sins in my name why
[1:08:56] would he say father son holy ghost in
[1:08:59] matthew which is where all trinitarians
[1:09:03] go for water baptism because matthew is
[1:09:07] guarding acts 2 38 acts 8 16 acts 22
[1:09:12] so there is a guard then you've got mark
[1:09:15] from the other side and mark guards the
[1:09:18] approach from another avenue john guards
[1:09:22] the approach from another avenue and
[1:09:24] luke guards it from another you mean
[1:09:27] brother donny god would do that well
[1:09:30] jesus one of the very few times that we
[1:09:33] have in the bible when the bible
[1:09:35] actually says that jesus rejoiced
[1:09:39] and said i thank thee o father for thou
[1:09:43] has hid this from the eyes of the wise
[1:09:48] and prudent and has revealed it unto
[1:09:51] babes
[1:09:52] thank god i'm a babe
[1:09:55] aren't you glad you could be taught by
[1:09:57] the father
[1:09:58] now why would god do it that way god
[1:10:00] never intended for his bible nor his
[1:10:04] revelation to be like picking up a book
[1:10:07] or the newspaper or going to you know
[1:10:10] some library somewhere or wherever it is
[1:10:13] you buy your books or read them whether
[1:10:15] they're on your ipod or ipad or you know
[1:10:17] your phone but god never intended for
[1:10:19] you to be able to pick it up and read it
[1:10:22] just by the mind but he intended to hide
[1:10:25] himself in the pages of the word and
[1:10:28] only those who really want to know him
[1:10:31] will find him
[1:10:33] now if you really want to then he's not
[1:10:35] going to stand there to stop you because
[1:10:37] you'll go right through that matthew
[1:10:39] gate and you'll be baptized according to
[1:10:42] acts 2 38.
[1:10:43] that's why we can baptize people right
[1:10:45] here in this pool and we can quote
[1:10:48] matthew 28 19 and say i baptize you in
[1:10:51] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:10:54] we're the only ones that fulfill matthew
[1:10:56] 28 19 and acts 2 38 when we do it is
[1:11:00] that right now i'm not just saying our
[1:11:01] church but all of those that baptize
[1:11:03] that way but it is placed there that he
[1:11:06] would be guarded so we find that here in
[1:11:09] heaven that the lamb was in behind
[1:11:12] those throne guards so it was hid in the
[1:11:16] very heart of god but yet now he's come
[1:11:19] to a time of dispensational change and
[1:11:22] what is it it is the opening of the book
[1:11:26] and the calling of the last name so this
[1:11:28] is the last time of redemption now let
[1:11:31] me just show you where we want to go
[1:11:32] tonight by the help of the lord i know
[1:11:34] that that most of you that's been around
[1:11:36] very long at all and you read your bible
[1:11:38] you know that there is coming a time of
[1:11:40] great tribulation on the earth
[1:11:43] our nation according to the seventh
[1:11:45] vision that the prophet saw is going to
[1:11:48] be annihilated and destroyed we know
[1:11:51] that the vatican will also be bombed so
[1:11:55] we know that bombs will play a great
[1:11:58] great thing in the drama of the last
[1:12:01] days it will actually be the atomic
[1:12:04] warfare that will purge the earth before
[1:12:08] going into the millennium remember the
[1:12:10] millennium is the seventh increment of
[1:12:13] time because god was called out of his
[1:12:17] millennium when adam fell so god's
[1:12:20] millennium was put on whole so in the
[1:12:23] millennium god's millennium will restart
[1:12:27] again and people will live for a
[1:12:30] thousand years on the earth but yet
[1:12:33] everything will not be perfect as it
[1:12:36] will be in the eighth day there will
[1:12:39] still be people on the earth that we
[1:12:41] will rule over did not david say in
[1:12:44] psalms 2 ask of me they are the heathen
[1:12:47] and i will give them unto thee for thine
[1:12:49] inheritance for he will rule them with a
[1:12:52] rod of iron now that's not people that
[1:12:55] wants to obey but they will be made to
[1:12:58] obey this is when the sons of god will
[1:13:00] come into full manifestation we will
[1:13:02] hold back the rain from those who don't
[1:13:05] come up to the feasts of tabernacles yes
[1:13:08] even in the millennium there will be
[1:13:10] people that don't see the need of going
[1:13:13] to church
[1:13:15] well we got them today don't we well
[1:13:17] they if they don't go up to the house of
[1:13:19] god then the sons of god will go right
[1:13:22] over there and tell them all right you
[1:13:24] weren't at the feasts of tabernacles the
[1:13:26] last time you were supposed to come up
[1:13:28] so you ain't getting no rain until you
[1:13:30] change your attitude and when you change
[1:13:33] your attitude let me know and i'll speak
[1:13:35] rain into existence for you
[1:13:38] that's right why will they do that
[1:13:40] because there will be people on the
[1:13:42] earth that will be living there in human
[1:13:44] bodies they're not converted yet and
[1:13:47] they're not in glorified bodies like the
[1:13:49] saints of god will be and yet they will
[1:13:52] live on the earth and they will make
[1:13:53] their choice you say who are they they
[1:13:55] are the heathen that never had the
[1:13:58] opportunity to give their heart to god
[1:14:00] so god will not bring them into judgment
[1:14:02] until he's reserved it to fulfill the
[1:14:04] prophecy of the book of psalms so they
[1:14:06] will not be judged until they've been
[1:14:09] given the right and once they choose
[1:14:12] many of them will choose to join up of
[1:14:14] course with christ and many of them will
[1:14:16] choose to follow the devil and then we
[1:14:18] know that the earth will come under a
[1:14:21] different type of fire this will be the
[1:14:24] holy fire from god this will fulfill of
[1:14:27] course the fire pre-millennium will
[1:14:29] fulfill the bride walking out on the
[1:14:32] ashes of the wicked but in the eighth
[1:14:35] day there will be no memory of the
[1:14:37] wicked there will be no ashes of the
[1:14:39] wicked the earth will be purified so
[1:14:43] deep that all of the great
[1:14:46] catastrophes rather that remain in the
[1:14:49] strata of the earth all the different
[1:14:52] things of the dinosaurs and so on and so
[1:14:55] on the core of the earth will be burned
[1:14:57] down so deep it will eradicate all the
[1:15:00] past memories because remember eight is
[1:15:03] new creation and the millennium if you
[1:15:06] would dig deep enough you'd still be
[1:15:09] able to find the bones of the mastodon
[1:15:12] or find the bones of a dinosaur because
[1:15:15] the atomic earths will not be able to go
[1:15:18] all the way and bring the earth into
[1:15:20] that new creation image but in the
[1:15:22] eighth day holy far from god not from
[1:15:26] russia holy fire from god will come down
[1:15:29] out of heaven because the earth is
[1:15:31] getting its baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:35] and that baptism of the holy ghost will
[1:15:37] do to the earth the same thing it done
[1:15:40] to you so it didn't just take out half
[1:15:42] of the world a quarter of the world it
[1:15:45] burned out every speck of the world out
[1:15:47] of your soul
[1:15:49] that's right so that's the hour of
[1:15:51] course that we're living for but until
[1:15:53] that time there's still yet things that
[1:15:56] must come to pass now i know you know
[1:15:59] that the earth is facing this time of
[1:16:02] what we identify as the great
[1:16:04] tribulation which is
[1:16:06] 1260 days or three and a half years of
[1:16:09] great tribulation that are left upon the
[1:16:11] earth but this cannot happen until
[1:16:15] several
[1:16:16] circumstances or prophetic events begin
[1:16:19] to happen on the earth and the rapture
[1:16:20] of course being one of them and the
[1:16:22] beast's power coming to the culmination
[1:16:25] to where satan's superman will be on the
[1:16:27] earth and then the chief demon will be
[1:16:29] inside of that man until the bride goes
[1:16:32] up then whenever the bride goes up the
[1:16:34] devil comes down and then satan will
[1:16:36] kick him out and satan will get in and
[1:16:37] himself but you know that there cannot
[1:16:40] be a tribulation on the earth as long as
[1:16:44] there's blood on the mercy seat
[1:16:47] now what what we're going through now
[1:16:49] and have been for the last 2 000 years
[1:16:52] satan has been able to be be able to be
[1:16:56] all that he wants to be in the sense of
[1:16:58] the prince of the power of the air and
[1:17:00] be able to control the storms be able to
[1:17:03] move in and out of dimensions appear and
[1:17:05] disappear things like that but yet it
[1:17:08] will not change from that until he is
[1:17:11] kicked out of heaven in revelation
[1:17:13] chapter 12. that will not happen until
[1:17:17] the bride is finished once the bride is
[1:17:20] done not only the bride but also the
[1:17:24] foolish virgin remember people teach and
[1:17:27] believe that many gentiles
[1:17:30] will get saved during the tribulation
[1:17:33] and they believe and teach that but that
[1:17:36] is wrong because there will be no mercy
[1:17:39] there will be no blood the sanctuary
[1:17:42] will be smoking
[1:17:44] the god will only be dealing with 144
[1:17:48] 000 and they will be converted in a day
[1:17:51] as it were so it's not like that there's
[1:17:53] a great big revival going on the earth
[1:17:56] yes i agree people will be crying people
[1:17:59] will be repenting there will be people
[1:18:01] going to church that have not been to
[1:18:03] church in years and they will think they
[1:18:07] are getting saved and those who are
[1:18:09] pentecostals that lean that direction no
[1:18:11] doubt many of them will think they are
[1:18:14] getting the holy ghost people will shout
[1:18:17] people will become so emotional they
[1:18:20] will cry they will my the churches will
[1:18:23] pack out many of them and preachers will
[1:18:26] believe it is the long sought after
[1:18:30] revival
[1:18:32] but they are so blind to the spirit of
[1:18:35] god
[1:18:36] they won't even know the mercy seat
[1:18:39] is empty
[1:18:41] now let's establish this from the fourth
[1:18:43] seal them names were put on the lamb's
[1:18:46] book of life before the foundation of
[1:18:48] the world will come forth just as
[1:18:50] certain as anything that's why jesus
[1:18:53] sits right there and waits with his
[1:18:56] mediatorial work until that last sea now
[1:18:59] remember he kept using the word lysid
[1:19:03] last name last person now the book of
[1:19:07] redemption does not uh it does not
[1:19:09] contain the names of the foolish virgin
[1:19:13] it is the lamb's book of life but over
[1:19:16] in the book of life are those that will
[1:19:19] be judged which is of course is the
[1:19:20] foolish virgin and those that are lost
[1:19:23] but his main focus is finishing up the
[1:19:27] last of that gentile bribe watch this in
[1:19:29] souls in prison when god takes that
[1:19:32] life's name and redeems it from that
[1:19:35] book of life that's all of it see there
[1:19:37] can be no more anyhow there can't be no
[1:19:40] more notice again anyhow that's all it's
[1:19:44] finished so let me tell you friend if
[1:19:46] you're waiting around for some type of
[1:19:48] event and you're going to give your
[1:19:50] heart to god then and you're going to
[1:19:51] get filled with the holy ghost i'm not
[1:19:53] sure exactly what you're waiting on but
[1:19:55] right here's what i'm waiting on now i
[1:19:58] realize a lot of the message folks are
[1:19:59] waiting for a tent and they're waiting
[1:20:01] for this and that and the other can't
[1:20:02] you see why satan wants you to believe
[1:20:04] such nonsense
[1:20:06] the people who believe that do not
[1:20:08] believe the lord jesus can come in the
[1:20:10] morning they cannot believe the coming
[1:20:12] of the lord could be before this service
[1:20:15] is over because according to their mind
[1:20:17] brother ram's got to have a tent they
[1:20:18] got to do this and they got to fly
[1:20:20] around on an airplane and that's a lie
[1:20:22] of the devil
[1:20:24] and the devil is trying to get message
[1:20:26] people around that so he can rock him to
[1:20:28] sleep because like it or not we got
[1:20:30] foolish virgin right around this message
[1:20:34] well it's going to make you mad but i've
[1:20:36] got to tell you the truth notice again
[1:20:38] in service we see jesus you see their
[1:20:40] names is put on the book of life the
[1:20:42] book of redemption jesus come
[1:20:45] to redeem those that have their names in
[1:20:47] the book
[1:20:49] and when that last name is redeemed the
[1:20:52] lamb takes the book and walks away now
[1:20:55] notice this date 11 12 63 so this is
[1:21:00] after the mystery of the seals has
[1:21:02] already been preached and yet the
[1:21:04] prophet is preaching a taking of the
[1:21:07] book which will only happen that's
[1:21:09] associated with the names not revealing
[1:21:12] the mysteries of the seals which
[1:21:14] happened in march of 63. now notice
[1:21:17] there is a literal taking of the book by
[1:21:20] which the lamb of god will call all of
[1:21:23] those elect and with that will come a
[1:21:26] resurrection it is not just the
[1:21:28] resurrection of those in our age only it
[1:21:31] is the resurrection on past there will
[1:21:33] be millions of them that will come up
[1:21:35] when will it be it will be when the last
[1:21:38] one whose name is in he takes the book
[1:21:42] and walks away that's all
[1:21:44] redemption is over
[1:21:46] it's closed
[1:21:48] now i want you to notice since the
[1:21:50] majority of christendom does not even
[1:21:53] know very little about this book anyway
[1:21:56] they know very little about the true
[1:21:58] baptism of the holy ghost they can drink
[1:22:01] and run around and do whatever more and
[1:22:04] say they've got the spirit of god well
[1:22:05] if they had the spirit of god it would
[1:22:07] not let them live like a bunch of devils
[1:22:10] the holy ghost in you will grieve you
[1:22:13] when you do something wrong how many
[1:22:15] knows that's right that's right that's
[1:22:17] why the bible speaking to those who have
[1:22:19] the holy ghost grieve not the holy
[1:22:21] spirit of god whereby you are sealed
[1:22:24] unto the day of your redemption it's
[1:22:25] easy to see that many of the so-called
[1:22:27] christians of the day do not have a
[1:22:30] grieving at all they can do nearly
[1:22:32] anything they want to do and claim
[1:22:35] they're under the blood this is why
[1:22:36] they'll know nothing
[1:22:38] about the spirit of god being taken from
[1:22:41] the earth once the holy ghost leaves
[1:22:44] this earth the majority of the world
[1:22:47] will not even know it
[1:22:49] they don't know he's left their
[1:22:50] assemblies already
[1:22:52] oh lord children we don't want him to
[1:22:54] live to leave ours
[1:22:56] i don't want him to leave my life
[1:22:57] brother rob i don't i don't want him to
[1:22:59] leave your life we want to keep him here
[1:23:01] we need him
[1:23:03] do we not
[1:23:04] notice the last name that's redeemed
[1:23:06] that was put on the book that settles it
[1:23:09] he comes to claim what he redeemed and
[1:23:12] it might be a strange time did you ever
[1:23:15] sing people will go right on preaching
[1:23:17] the church will go right on even
[1:23:20] thinking they're getting people saved
[1:23:22] it's too late tim it's all over the
[1:23:25] message will go to the totally lost
[1:23:30] just like it did in the days of noah
[1:23:32] seven days in the ark it did in the days
[1:23:34] of sodom jesus himself his third stage
[1:23:37] of his ministry went and preached to the
[1:23:39] souls that were eternally lost
[1:23:42] that were in prison
[1:23:44] that repented not the long suffering in
[1:23:47] the days of noah and we don't know what
[1:23:49] time these things
[1:23:52] might happen you know what's so sad i
[1:23:54] mean the folks that have left the
[1:23:55] message and they absolutely hate the
[1:23:57] message they hate brother random i don't
[1:23:59] care what they say they hate him look at
[1:24:01] their actions
[1:24:02] do you realize it will be his voice
[1:24:06] they will hear
[1:24:08] in the regions of the lost
[1:24:11] part of their torment
[1:24:13] will not just be fire
[1:24:15] and sulfur and smoke
[1:24:18] it will be the voice of that messenger
[1:24:22] that they so despise
[1:24:24] and a preacher that preached that same
[1:24:27] message and told them don't go this way
[1:24:30] don't do that dog shut up i can't stand
[1:24:33] you i hate to hear you preach
[1:24:36] they'll hear it again maybe for
[1:24:39] thousands of years in their place of
[1:24:42] punishment
[1:24:43] think of it you talking about tormenting
[1:24:46] try to put their hands over their ears
[1:24:49] as it was and stick their fingers in
[1:24:50] their ears and stop themself from
[1:24:53] hearing the voice of that prophet that
[1:24:56] they absolutely hate
[1:24:58] it'll be part of their torment
[1:25:01] well i don't plan on being there because
[1:25:03] it don't torment me when i hear it amen
[1:25:06] aren't you glad the message don't
[1:25:08] torment you
[1:25:09] i'm glad i love it brother wes i'm so
[1:25:11] glad by the keith that i love the
[1:25:13] message of the
[1:25:14] end time
[1:25:16] oh my notice he said we're trying to get
[1:25:18] every soul safe so that jesus can come
[1:25:21] he cannot come unto that last one that
[1:25:23] is the name of the book of life that was
[1:25:25] put there before the foundation of the
[1:25:27] world when that name is called
[1:25:29] then the last one then he come to redeem
[1:25:33] to bring back redeemers to bring back
[1:25:35] when he brings the last one in he's
[1:25:37] setting at the right hand of god tonight
[1:25:39] doing his mediatorial work when that
[1:25:42] life soul is saved that was redeemed and
[1:25:45] seen and knowed by god
[1:25:47] before the foundation of the world when
[1:25:49] that life soul is saved that closes the
[1:25:52] book that closes the book when that book
[1:25:57] is closed
[1:25:58] it closes the door of mercy
[1:26:01] for the gentiles
[1:26:04] so whenever the life's name is called
[1:26:07] and finished that person is finished
[1:26:10] they come through to the baptism of the
[1:26:12] holy ghost and they go through whatever
[1:26:14] short period of trials and so on that
[1:26:16] they need to bring them to that state
[1:26:18] where they need to be perfected as we
[1:26:20] would say then that will close the book
[1:26:24] of the lamb's redemptive names it will
[1:26:26] also close the door of mercy when the
[1:26:30] door of mercy is closed there will be no
[1:26:34] more gentiles saved
[1:26:36] there will be no more foolish virgin
[1:26:39] saved there will be no more people
[1:26:41] who've been waiting for this and that
[1:26:43] and the other whatever the reason an
[1:26:45] excuse is to get the holy ghost the holy
[1:26:48] ghost will not baptize one more gentile
[1:26:53] lord have mercy help us jesus
[1:26:56] notice the brother said the reason today
[1:26:58] that there is mercy is because the mercy
[1:27:01] seat is sprinkled with an atonement
[1:27:04] blood
[1:27:05] and as long as the blood is on the
[1:27:08] judgment seat then it's not judgment no
[1:27:11] more it's mercy because something died
[1:27:15] to stay judgment this is why i say the
[1:27:17] tribulation period could not break on
[1:27:20] the earth as long as the earth is
[1:27:23] blanketed by the blood of the lord jesus
[1:27:27] you understand as long as the mortals on
[1:27:29] the earth they still have the breath of
[1:27:32] life then there's a chance for them to
[1:27:35] be saved
[1:27:37] no matter how wicked how wrong you know
[1:27:39] all that they've done as long as they're
[1:27:41] here and they're breathing the breath of
[1:27:44] life then the earth is covered by a
[1:27:47] blanket of the blood of the lord jesus
[1:27:50] this is why god cannot sin the great
[1:27:53] tribulation and the blood be on the
[1:27:56] earth at the same time it would not
[1:27:58] match it would not match all hell will
[1:28:01] break loose when the bride is taken
[1:28:04] because the blood will go with her
[1:28:07] now watch this he said something died to
[1:28:09] stay the judgment you see the blood on
[1:28:12] the mercy seat is keeping this
[1:28:14] tremendous severe opening of the vials
[1:28:18] from coming to pass this is why the
[1:28:19] vials cannot happen and our dispensation
[1:28:22] but they will tie together under the
[1:28:24] reality of the opening of the sixth seal
[1:28:27] then all hell will break loose on the
[1:28:29] earth because the inhabitants of the
[1:28:31] earth will be dealing with an angry
[1:28:34] devil
[1:28:36] and they will also be dealing with the
[1:28:38] outpouring of the judgment of god now
[1:28:41] this is what john saw and he saw those
[1:28:44] bowls or the new testament calls it
[1:28:46] vials of judgment the the greek word
[1:28:48] there's actually a bowl and it was a
[1:28:51] bowl of the wrath of god so it's not
[1:28:54] just satan being angry but the wrath of
[1:28:56] god why couldn't he do it say back in
[1:28:58] the 1500s he could not do it the blood
[1:29:02] blanketed the earth why couldn't he do
[1:29:04] it in laodicea the blood blanketed the
[1:29:08] earth notice this you remember when the
[1:29:11] prophet had went to that little
[1:29:13] restaurant
[1:29:14] and he saw that woman there and she had
[1:29:16] her lips all painted up and he saw that
[1:29:18] police officer drinking and i saw them
[1:29:20] playing the you know the different games
[1:29:22] and stuff that was there and in his
[1:29:24] heart brother brennan began to judge
[1:29:27] those people which most of us have
[1:29:29] probably done the same thing and he
[1:29:31] began to judge and this is one thing i
[1:29:33] love about this man that he's able to
[1:29:36] tell us what he done wrong he's able to
[1:29:38] tell us when the lord corrected him a
[1:29:40] person can follow a man like that i know
[1:29:43] some of the message people can't they've
[1:29:44] got to have a perfect human well i hate
[1:29:46] to tell you there's only one of them
[1:29:48] that ever lived and his name was not
[1:29:49] branham
[1:29:51] his name was the lord jesus
[1:29:53] but brother branham the spirit of god
[1:29:55] calls him over to one side and he shows
[1:29:58] him a vision he remembers the vision so
[1:30:00] he calls him over to one side and he
[1:30:02] goes to seeing this vision and he sees
[1:30:05] the earth blanketed covered over by
[1:30:09] blood and then brother branham sees sins
[1:30:12] and here's the lord jesus and he sees
[1:30:14] these sins coming up and whenever they
[1:30:17] would they would hit the lord jesus and
[1:30:19] he said oh jesus is that the sins of the
[1:30:22] world and he said no
[1:30:24] them's yours
[1:30:27] oh he said oh lord i'm sorry please
[1:30:29] forgive me please forgive me and
[1:30:31] remember the vision he dipped his finger
[1:30:33] in his side out of his blood and wrote
[1:30:36] on there pardoned on his book and then
[1:30:38] he sold his book and the sea of
[1:30:39] forgiveness i said i forgive you he said
[1:30:42] oh thank you jesus thank you jesus he
[1:30:44] said i forgive you but you condemn them
[1:30:47] now here this opens up something to
[1:30:50] brother branham that apparently he
[1:30:51] hadn't seen before i know that choked
[1:30:53] some of y'all to death but he was had to
[1:30:55] preach what he saw in progression
[1:30:57] praise the lord now notice this and the
[1:31:00] law having a shadow he says i thought oh
[1:31:02] i see if that's the reason god can't
[1:31:06] take the life of those people sinners
[1:31:09] because they are yet protected now
[1:31:12] listen they're not protected in the
[1:31:14] sense of the son or daughter of god is
[1:31:16] but as long as they remain on this earth
[1:31:19] and they're under the protection of that
[1:31:21] blood there's that chance that they can
[1:31:24] be saved
[1:31:25] now once he says it's like a bumper to
[1:31:28] the world i said oh i see i see lord
[1:31:30] what you mean yeah the blood of jesus
[1:31:32] christ covered the world like this and
[1:31:35] every man while you're here you're still
[1:31:38] a moral mortal agent and he said if you
[1:31:41] reject it then you die your soul goes
[1:31:44] beyond that so of all the billions of
[1:31:47] people that are on the face of the earth
[1:31:49] today they're under this canopy of the
[1:31:52] protection of the blood
[1:31:54] in that as long as they're breathing the
[1:31:56] breath of life they can be able to be
[1:31:59] saved if they wish to are you saving a
[1:32:02] faint bride even if they ain't bright
[1:32:05] he made a way if you want to go there if
[1:32:07] you're not even bright you don't have to
[1:32:09] be lost you can be saved if you wish is
[1:32:12] that right
[1:32:13] and as long as they're breathing the
[1:32:15] breaths of life then the chance is here
[1:32:17] but notice what happens to him but he
[1:32:19] said if you reject it then you die then
[1:32:22] your soul goes beyond that then you've
[1:32:27] judged yourself
[1:32:29] so when people actually die as many of
[1:32:31] them have died around the world this
[1:32:33] very day several have died since we've
[1:32:35] been here at church and once they take
[1:32:37] their last breath the soul leaves their
[1:32:39] body then they go beyond the bumper or
[1:32:43] the protection or the opportunity of
[1:32:46] salvation and once they go beyond that
[1:32:49] they have judged themselves i am worthy
[1:32:53] of hell
[1:32:55] i am unfit for heaven i turn down god's
[1:32:59] provided way i am worthy of hell
[1:33:04] oh my god don't have to judge it see if
[1:33:07] you dial it out the blood of christ
[1:33:09] you're a sinner and you're lost if you
[1:33:12] accept the blood then you're in christ
[1:33:15] and you're protected now whenever then
[1:33:18] the person goes beyond that that time
[1:33:22] the interval of intercession of
[1:33:25] mediatorial work for them as an
[1:33:27] individual it is over why they move
[1:33:30] beyond the realm of mortality they have
[1:33:33] no more chance even though the mercy
[1:33:35] seat is still open it's no longer open
[1:33:39] for them we do not believe and preach a
[1:33:42] purgatory
[1:33:44] if you die lost you're raised lost
[1:33:47] well praise the lord well my mama can
[1:33:50] pray me i know your mom ain't got enough
[1:33:52] power
[1:33:53] nor does mary
[1:33:55] nor does joseph or anybody else
[1:33:58] is that right
[1:33:59] but whenever the lord will lift it now
[1:34:02] as a whole
[1:34:04] over the earth it's not like an
[1:34:06] individual goes an individual goes
[1:34:08] another individual goes and when they do
[1:34:10] their day of mercy is over every day
[1:34:12] today the day of mercy has ended for god
[1:34:15] knows how many around the world but one
[1:34:18] day the day of mercy for the gentiles
[1:34:21] will stop like
[1:34:23] that
[1:34:25] what will trigger it him changing
[1:34:28] clothes
[1:34:30] he will move from being the lamb of god
[1:34:35] then he moves over
[1:34:37] into the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:34:42] so as long as the dispensation of the
[1:34:45] lamb of god that we have a claim on him
[1:34:48] and mercy is there then a person can be
[1:34:50] saved once he becomes that now he's
[1:34:53] moving over into the office of king he
[1:34:56] can no longer save the gentiles
[1:35:00] what's this in the fourth seal soon he's
[1:35:02] going to rise now and come forth to
[1:35:04] claim what he's redeemed he's doing the
[1:35:06] work of the kinsmen redeemer while ruth
[1:35:10] is waiting but soon you know actual boy
[1:35:13] has done the kinsmen work then he come
[1:35:15] and claimed his possession and that's
[1:35:17] exactly what the bible said he'd done he
[1:35:20] come forth and took the book
[1:35:23] then intercession is over he's off the
[1:35:27] throne there's no more blood on the
[1:35:29] mercy seat then what is it
[1:35:31] judgment sick
[1:35:33] why can god not judge the world tonight
[1:35:37] and actually condemn every one of them
[1:35:40] to be lost because there's still blood
[1:35:43] on the judgment seat which changes it
[1:35:45] from a judgment seat to a mercy when the
[1:35:49] blood is removed and the lawyer
[1:35:53] walks away
[1:35:54] from the judge's bench
[1:35:56] listen
[1:35:57] the lamb of god is the mediatorial work
[1:36:01] of the lawyer of god's mercy
[1:36:04] and when the lawyer of god's mercy walks
[1:36:08] away from the judgment seat
[1:36:11] and walks in behind the courtneys would
[1:36:12] say and he comes back out and he changes
[1:36:15] his garments and he steps out as the
[1:36:18] king the angels know it's time for him
[1:36:20] to get his queen bride
[1:36:24] he cannot be the lawyer he cannot be the
[1:36:28] lamb of god
[1:36:30] and be the lion of the tribe of judah at
[1:36:32] the same time
[1:36:33] then mercy is over
[1:36:36] then the sanctuary
[1:36:38] which held the blood
[1:36:40] now becomes smokey
[1:36:43] so there's no more blood on the mercy
[1:36:46] seat to hold back the wrath of god
[1:36:50] lord children you don't want to be here
[1:36:52] i'm telling you
[1:36:54] i don't care how hard you have to fight
[1:36:56] i don't care what you've got to go
[1:36:57] through being a child of god that is
[1:36:59] mild compared to what you're going to go
[1:37:01] through if you're left
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:04] notice this injunction time many who
[1:37:07] laugh
[1:37:08] and make fun
[1:37:10] and say the days of miracles is past i
[1:37:14] love this quote
[1:37:15] when miracles
[1:37:17] happening daily
[1:37:19] in the believer's life
[1:37:22] amen
[1:37:23] that's my god
[1:37:25] people that laugh and make fun of
[1:37:28] miracles and yet real believers are
[1:37:30] happening daily in our lives it'll be
[1:37:32] too late for them that that day the
[1:37:35] doors of mercy will be closed and the
[1:37:38] sanctuary will become smokey
[1:37:42] again he says i don't want to be here
[1:37:44] now what brother branham is referencing
[1:37:46] here is that brother neville had
[1:37:47] preached on the radio broadcast the
[1:37:50] tabernacle there had a radio broadcast
[1:37:52] and brother neville actually took the
[1:37:54] service and preached on the radio and
[1:37:56] they had singers from the church and so
[1:37:58] on that would go sing so brother neville
[1:38:00] that week had preached on the radio
[1:38:03] broadcast and brother neville had said
[1:38:06] that that whenever the spirit of god is
[1:38:09] lifted from the earth that the religious
[1:38:12] people of the world are so sad in their
[1:38:15] religious ways they'll never even know
[1:38:17] it when it happens
[1:38:19] and brother branham thought it was so
[1:38:21] astounding well you can read these
[1:38:23] couple of paragraphs about this people
[1:38:24] check me out brother branham thought it
[1:38:26] was so astounding can you imagine
[1:38:29] brother branham getting inspiration from
[1:38:31] brother neville
[1:38:33] i can
[1:38:34] because brother branham believed in the
[1:38:36] other fools of the aspect of the
[1:38:38] ministry
[1:38:39] he didn't believe he fulfilled all five
[1:38:41] well praise the lord
[1:38:43] so brother branham is now repeating what
[1:38:46] he heard by the devil say as a matter of
[1:38:48] fact he said he thought harry that it
[1:38:50] was just outstanding
[1:38:52] the thing that brother neville had
[1:38:55] and here he now is repeating it again
[1:38:57] before the people i don't want to be
[1:38:59] here when he's not here he's talking
[1:39:00] about the holy spirit whenever the
[1:39:02] spirit of god is lifted from the earth i
[1:39:04] want to be gone then yes sir for there
[1:39:06] be no blood
[1:39:08] on the mercy seat it'll be dark and
[1:39:11] smoky
[1:39:12] and black the sanctuary
[1:39:15] will have no
[1:39:17] lawyer
[1:39:20] there to plead our case
[1:39:26] so the sanctuary will be emptied out of
[1:39:30] the blood of the lamb
[1:39:33] and the lawyer who has been there for 2
[1:39:35] 000 years
[1:39:37] can no longer be found
[1:39:40] so there's no one
[1:39:42] to plead your case
[1:39:46] oh i'm glad he's there tonight
[1:39:49] i know some of you you may not think you
[1:39:51] need him i need him every day
[1:39:53] i need him every day of my life
[1:39:55] whenever i'm sick when i'm worried when
[1:39:57] i'm afflicted whatever it is i'm going
[1:39:58] through i need a lawyer there to plead
[1:40:00] me i get ignorant i get lazy or whatever
[1:40:02] more anybody else should ride with me i
[1:40:05] need a lawyer right there oh glory to
[1:40:07] god not me i'm perfect no you're not
[1:40:08] perfect you're just crazy
[1:40:10] you need the grace of god just like all
[1:40:12] the rest of us does
[1:40:14] and we need not a judge we need a lawyer
[1:40:18] an attorney our defense attorney and we
[1:40:22] don't have to say one thing all we got
[1:40:25] to do is say what he said
[1:40:27] and just believe his word and quote his
[1:40:30] word and he will stand in our defense
[1:40:34] but can you imagine whenever the
[1:40:36] judgment see the blood is taken off and
[1:40:39] the smoke fills the sanctuary and you
[1:40:41] look around you look everywhere but
[1:40:44] there's no defense attorney
[1:40:48] all is left is the judge
[1:40:52] oh god
[1:40:54] the sanctuary will have no lawyer there
[1:40:56] to plead our case at that time you know
[1:41:00] the scripture says that the sanctuary
[1:41:02] was smoking there was no blood on the
[1:41:05] mercy seat then it's judgment
[1:41:08] notice again as someone's in prison he
[1:41:10] says see in every way the world will
[1:41:12] carry right on
[1:41:14] people will still come to the altar
[1:41:18] they'll still cry out
[1:41:21] but it won't do no good
[1:41:23] they'll be gone see
[1:41:26] it'll be over there won't be
[1:41:29] no mercy
[1:41:31] now some of you may want to criticize
[1:41:33] our kids
[1:41:34] when they feel the spirit of god dealing
[1:41:36] with them to repent and get baptized
[1:41:38] i'll tell you what the prophet said at
[1:41:40] any age
[1:41:41] whenever the spirit of god is dealing
[1:41:43] with them let them come
[1:41:44] my goodness there's i've not found no
[1:41:46] quote whether god would be 25 35 45 85
[1:41:50] before they can come to the lord jesus
[1:41:52] my if god can deal with it and lord
[1:41:54] general look around we've got nine 10 11
[1:41:56] year olds that are killing people we had
[1:41:59] a 10 year old boy just arrested the
[1:42:00] other day that was threatening to do
[1:42:02] another one of those murder things in
[1:42:04] his own school and they had to arrest a
[1:42:07] 10 year old boy where in the world are
[1:42:09] they getting all that stuff probably the
[1:42:11] movies and the video games where they're
[1:42:13] killing them blowing up people and
[1:42:15] shooting them and parents don't think
[1:42:17] that has no effect on them sure it has
[1:42:19] an effect on them
[1:42:20] it ain't like they're hunting a deer or
[1:42:22] a turkey they're shooting a man they're
[1:42:24] shooting a woman in those video games
[1:42:27] what is it it's nothing but the devil
[1:42:29] trying to captivate the minds of our
[1:42:32] children our nation has turned god down
[1:42:35] and now god is turning his back on her
[1:42:39] oh my
[1:42:41] lord help us jesus
[1:42:44] notice this he says he that is filthy is
[1:42:46] filthy still he that is righteous is
[1:42:49] righteous still
[1:42:50] he that is holy is holy still there's no
[1:42:52] more mercy
[1:42:54] when the lamb takes the book that's it
[1:42:57] that's
[1:42:58] all of it look young people old people
[1:43:00] whoever you are here tonight streaming
[1:43:01] their service if you ain't got the holy
[1:43:03] ghost i implore you as a servant of god
[1:43:05] don't wait
[1:43:06] don't wait well i i i you know i want to
[1:43:08] sew a few more wild oats i'm going to do
[1:43:10] this and other you who knows if you'll
[1:43:12] even make it out of this church service
[1:43:17] now watch i love the way that they asked
[1:43:19] the prophet this question in question
[1:43:20] answer 64. you know the message is god
[1:43:23] speaking through the prophet to us
[1:43:24] question answers is the people with
[1:43:26] their misunderstandings and their
[1:43:28] misconceptions of things asking him the
[1:43:30] questions and many times things that he
[1:43:31] already preached and it'll be much
[1:43:33] clarification brought to this what did i
[1:43:36] say that would make y'all believe that
[1:43:38] no no no no no that's not right that's
[1:43:40] not right you know because the people
[1:43:42] heard it that way or they misunderstood
[1:43:44] it what's this add to the brightest
[1:43:45] rapture will any of the foolish virgin
[1:43:47] be saved or will they all be lost no see
[1:43:50] everything will be finished for the
[1:43:52] gentile church when the bride is taken
[1:43:54] from the earth
[1:43:56] the spirit of god
[1:44:00] leaves
[1:44:02] the earth
[1:44:04] he that is filthy is filthy still he
[1:44:06] this righteous is righteous still he
[1:44:08] that is holy and holy still in other
[1:44:10] words the sanctuary becomes smokey
[1:44:14] listen to children
[1:44:16] where the attorney stands to plead the
[1:44:18] case christ leaves
[1:44:22] the sanctuary his day of mediatorial is
[1:44:24] over
[1:44:25] the rapture comes
[1:44:28] he leaves from the sanctuary goes forth
[1:44:31] and takes
[1:44:33] notice when this is preached now
[1:44:35] 1964. he's still talking about a taking
[1:44:38] of the book what book is it
[1:44:44] he goes for us and takes the book of
[1:44:46] redemption and claims everything he's
[1:44:50] redeemed there's no more mediatorial
[1:44:53] work
[1:44:56] the bride will go up
[1:44:58] now let's read in revelation 12
[1:45:01] verse 9
[1:45:03] and the great dragon was cast out
[1:45:06] that old serpent
[1:45:09] called the devil and satan
[1:45:12] which deceive us the whole world
[1:45:15] he was cast out
[1:45:17] into the earth
[1:45:19] and his angels
[1:45:21] were cast out with him
[1:45:24] now notice what happens
[1:45:26] when he's cast out
[1:45:28] sort of like it was and it was cast out
[1:45:29] of us
[1:45:31] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[1:45:32] heaven
[1:45:33] now has come salvation
[1:45:35] that's what happened to me when i got a
[1:45:37] cast out of me
[1:45:38] well that's what happened to y'all too
[1:45:40] and you got that devil cast out of you
[1:45:42] now it's come salvation and strength and
[1:45:45] the kingdom of our god
[1:45:48] and the power of his christ they are
[1:45:51] rejoicing they are having a revival in
[1:45:54] heaven listen why
[1:45:56] for the accuser of our brethren
[1:46:00] is cast down
[1:46:03] oh glory to god heaven is rejoicing
[1:46:07] because the bride has already going up
[1:46:11] and whenever she goes up don't you
[1:46:13] understand a big lot of his employment
[1:46:17] is false accusations against us
[1:46:20] and as long as we're hearing these
[1:46:22] mortal bodies and we're falling short of
[1:46:24] the glory of god and making mistakes
[1:46:27] just being in this body alone speaks
[1:46:30] that we've not yet been fully redeemed
[1:46:33] but when we get a glorified body he
[1:46:35] ain't got nothing else to say against us
[1:46:40] glory be to god glory be to god we'll
[1:46:44] have a body that matches our soul then
[1:46:49] so when the lord jesus consummates that
[1:46:52] work in the hearts of the elected then
[1:46:55] the devil is cast out if you notice you
[1:46:57] don't just open the door and say but you
[1:46:59] care to leave this is kind of a private
[1:47:01] time for me and my bride we're going to
[1:47:02] have our honeymoon now but he cast him
[1:47:04] out
[1:47:05] oh
[1:47:07] glory to god
[1:47:08] so that old devil is cast out and i hope
[1:47:11] you understand right now he has access
[1:47:15] into this certain part of heaven
[1:47:18] uh-huh
[1:47:20] but there's another certain part of
[1:47:22] heaven which has been in creation
[1:47:25] since the last 2 000 years
[1:47:28] not one devil's ever stepped one foot
[1:47:31] in that part
[1:47:33] why that's
[1:47:34] yours amen
[1:47:37] heavens and earth will pass away don't
[1:47:40] you know jesus said i've gone away to
[1:47:42] prepare a place for you don't you
[1:47:44] understand that city that john saw it
[1:47:47] was not already into creation when the
[1:47:50] lord jesus comes to the earth
[1:47:52] he comes to get his bride first and then
[1:47:55] he goes back and starts building her
[1:47:56] house
[1:47:58] all glory to god he comes and pays the
[1:48:01] price and then he goes back and starts
[1:48:03] building our house and he's got up signs
[1:48:06] everywhere no devil's allowed
[1:48:09] no trespassing for the accuser no
[1:48:12] trespassing for the liar no trespassing
[1:48:15] for satan or any his angel
[1:48:19] that city that john saw descending from
[1:48:22] god out of heaven the devil ain't
[1:48:24] stepped not one toe in that city
[1:48:26] and he never will
[1:48:30] [Applause]
[1:48:34] oh my
[1:48:36] notice how this voice
[1:48:39] in heaven identifies
[1:48:41] the consummation
[1:48:43] of salvation
[1:48:45] and strength
[1:48:46] and the kingdom of god and of his christ
[1:48:50] was the ascension of the elect
[1:48:54] and the casting out
[1:48:56] of the devil
[1:48:57] for the accuser of our brethren
[1:49:02] is cast down
[1:49:04] but there's one thing we've got to say
[1:49:05] about that old boy he's perseverant
[1:49:09] which accused them before god
[1:49:16] say it
[1:49:17] day
[1:49:18] and night
[1:49:20] that's one thing about it you've got to
[1:49:21] give him an a for effort
[1:49:23] he gets an f on everything else but he
[1:49:25] is the least
[1:49:27] can you imagine him accusing us
[1:49:31] before the throne of god day and night
[1:49:34] it's like he never stops
[1:49:37] but once we go up
[1:49:41] the accusation
[1:49:42] has ceased
[1:49:44] so what is he accusing
[1:49:46] our humanity
[1:49:49] now what's really sad is when we
[1:49:52] will find ourselves in harmony with his
[1:49:57] accusation i'm not worthy i'm not good
[1:50:00] enough i've got all these fears but my
[1:50:03] daddy didn't make it my mama didn't make
[1:50:05] it so and so didn't make it it just
[1:50:07] ruins in my family to be defeated that's
[1:50:09] not what the lord jesus is saying about
[1:50:11] you
[1:50:12] you have got the best lawyer anybody
[1:50:15] could ever have
[1:50:17] and our lawyer says there is therefore
[1:50:19] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:50:24] christ jesus who walk not out to the
[1:50:26] flesh but after the spirit that's what
[1:50:30] the lawyer says
[1:50:33] [Applause]
[1:50:35] but the accuser on the other side said
[1:50:39] you know you ain't perfect
[1:50:42] what about that little something that
[1:50:43] you said that was a little white lie
[1:50:45] where did you ever get that idea there
[1:50:47] was such a white lie
[1:50:49] oh you lost your temper and you done
[1:50:51] this and that and you know what he wants
[1:50:53] you to do he wants you to say about you
[1:50:56] what he says about you in heaven i
[1:50:58] refuse to say what he says
[1:51:01] i agree it might be used or some time
[1:51:03] for my old flesh to agree with his
[1:51:05] accusation
[1:51:06] but i'm not agreeing with his accusation
[1:51:08] i'm agreeing with the confession of my
[1:51:11] lawyer the prophet said god can only do
[1:51:13] for you on earth or in heaven rather as
[1:51:16] you confess on earth
[1:51:19] so if you say he is my healer he is my
[1:51:22] forgiver he is my holy ghost baptizer he
[1:51:25] is my redeemer and you say it down here
[1:51:28] what's he saying in heaven i am his
[1:51:30] healer i am his savior glory to god i am
[1:51:34] his redeemer i am his el shaddai
[1:51:38] [Applause]
[1:51:42] look at who the accused are
[1:51:45] did you notice this voice didn't say
[1:51:49] that satan accused any of his own
[1:51:53] do you realize a lost man and woman
[1:51:56] they don't live under the constant
[1:51:59] accusation
[1:52:00] that you live under as a child of god
[1:52:04] i'll tell you one thing that ought to
[1:52:05] make even some of you dry heights just
[1:52:07] have you a spell
[1:52:09] whenever the devil goes to accusing you
[1:52:13] even in your mind
[1:52:16] that ought to be one of the best signs
[1:52:18] you know that you don't belong to him
[1:52:19] because he don't accuse his that's right
[1:52:22] you think he wants to go around telling
[1:52:24] them you're going to hell if you're
[1:52:25] smoking cigarettes you're going to help
[1:52:26] you keep drinking that vodka you're
[1:52:27] going to help you keep committing don't
[1:52:29] you think he's going to tell him he said
[1:52:30] go ahead drink her body drink her smoke
[1:52:32] one for me get hiring a child go ahead
[1:52:35] and do this and now the other he don't
[1:52:37] accuse his
[1:52:38] he accuses gods
[1:52:41] well blessed be the lord and let me just
[1:52:43] go ahead and sit this way those on the
[1:52:46] earth today who are accusing the bride
[1:52:49] they are of their father the devil
[1:52:54] and the works of their father they are
[1:52:56] doing as he is doing in heaven accusing
[1:52:59] the bride so are his subjects on the
[1:53:02] earth accusing the bride now oh there
[1:53:04] are a bunch of man-followers so this and
[1:53:06] that and the other go ahead and accuse
[1:53:07] us if you want to you're talking the
[1:53:09] devil's talk
[1:53:14] notice job chapter one verse six
[1:53:17] oh my goodness don't tell me it's
[1:53:18] already this time don't look back don't
[1:53:20] worry
[1:53:24] not almost a day when the sons of god
[1:53:26] came to present themselves before the
[1:53:28] lord
[1:53:31] and guess who showed up
[1:53:33] the devil that's right
[1:53:35] and satan came also among them
[1:53:38] and the lord said unto satan once cometh
[1:53:40] sound then satan answered the lord and
[1:53:42] said from going to and from the earth
[1:53:44] and from walking up and down in it and
[1:53:47] the lord said unto satan
[1:53:50] have you considered
[1:53:52] my servant job
[1:53:54] wow
[1:53:56] man what a testimony meeting when god's
[1:53:59] doing the testifying about you
[1:54:03] that there is none like him in the earth
[1:54:07] a perfect
[1:54:09] and an upright man
[1:54:11] one that feareth god and askus evil
[1:54:16] now watch the accuser
[1:54:19] then satan answered the lord and said
[1:54:21] dost job fear god for naught
[1:54:25] hassan made and hedged about him about
[1:54:27] his house about all that he has on every
[1:54:29] side thou expressed the work of his
[1:54:30] hands and his substance increased in the
[1:54:32] land and but put forth sign hand now and
[1:54:36] touch all that he has
[1:54:38] he will curse thee to thy face and satan
[1:54:42] had proved once again you were a liar
[1:54:50] so he accused job right to god
[1:54:55] when god had said he's perfect there
[1:54:57] ain't nobody like him and satan come
[1:54:59] right back around to go right against
[1:55:01] what god said and said that's not the
[1:55:03] truth you curse him you let this happen
[1:55:05] to him take his health take his children
[1:55:07] to this another while the man will curse
[1:55:10] you to your face
[1:55:13] and the lord said unto satan behold all
[1:55:15] that he hath is in thy power only upon
[1:55:17] himself put forth not thine hand so
[1:55:20] satan went forth from the presence of
[1:55:22] the lord
[1:55:25] and how did this testimony meet and end
[1:55:27] up
[1:55:28] god testified for him and the devil
[1:55:30] testified against him
[1:55:32] anybody know the book of job the end of
[1:55:34] how i come out
[1:55:36] well you know sometimes i figure god
[1:55:37] must testify about us so if you consider
[1:55:40] my daughter down there she loves me oh
[1:55:42] sure she's healthy she's got this and
[1:55:44] that and the other but let me touch her
[1:55:46] let me touch him let me do this now god
[1:55:48] said oh no
[1:55:50] no i know her i know him he loves me
[1:55:54] let's stand up
[1:56:00] praise the lord
[1:56:03] i didn't say i was done i just touched
[1:56:04] you stand up
[1:56:06] so let me read one more scripture and
[1:56:08] we'll pick it up again
[1:56:09] zechariah chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:56:13] and he showed me
[1:56:14] joshua the high priest standing before
[1:56:17] the angel of the lord
[1:56:19] and satan
[1:56:21] standing
[1:56:22] at his right hand
[1:56:24] to resist him
[1:56:27] look at this hebrew word what resist
[1:56:29] means
[1:56:32] ah
[1:56:33] satan
[1:56:35] satan
[1:56:37] so you see when people resist the word
[1:56:40] when they resist the higher power
[1:56:42] it is saturn
[1:56:48] to be an act as an adversary resist
[1:56:53] or oppose
[1:56:55] and the lord said unto satan
[1:56:58] the lord rebuked thee o satan
[1:57:01] even the lord that hath chosen jerusalem
[1:57:04] rebuked thee
[1:57:05] is not this a bran plucked out of the
[1:57:08] fire now joshua was closed
[1:57:12] with filthy garments and he stood before
[1:57:14] the angel
[1:57:16] and he answered and spake unto those who
[1:57:18] stood before him said
[1:57:20] this is what happened to us
[1:57:22] take away the filthy garments from him
[1:57:27] and unto him he said behold i have cause
[1:57:29] and iniquity to pass from thee and i
[1:57:31] will close thee
[1:57:33] with a change of ramen
[1:57:38] and this is what god did for us
[1:57:41] we were as filthy as we could be
[1:57:44] but god caused us to change clothes
[1:57:48] in romans 8 32 he spared not his own son
[1:57:50] but delivered him up for us all
[1:57:53] how shall he not with him also freely
[1:57:55] give us all things
[1:57:57] who
[1:57:59] shall lay anything
[1:58:01] to the charge
[1:58:03] of god's
[1:58:04] elect it is god
[1:58:09] that justifies
[1:58:11] this is why you don't have to argue with
[1:58:13] the devil you don't have to say well i'm
[1:58:15] saved i've got the holy ghost on a
[1:58:16] certain day i've done this i don't know
[1:58:18] when you get done with all of that if he
[1:58:20] argued with god about job he'll argue
[1:58:22] with you about you
[1:58:26] really not
[1:58:28] so you just ignore him
[1:58:30] and keep testifying
[1:58:32] i'm saved and i know that i am i'm saved
[1:58:37] and i know that i am i'm saved
[1:58:41] and i know that i am i'm so glad i know
[1:58:45] that i am i'm sanctified
[1:58:49] and i know that i am i'm sanctified
[1:58:53] and i know that i am i'm sanctified
[1:58:57] and i know that i am
[1:58:59] i'm so glad i know that i am well
[1:59:03] i'm
[1:59:04] bright and i know that i am i'm bright
[1:59:09] and i know that i am i'm proud
[1:59:13] and i know that i
[1:59:16] i am so glad i know that i am
[1:59:22] [Applause]
[1:59:30] just one more
[1:59:31] romans 8 34 who
[1:59:34] is he
[1:59:35] that condemneth
[1:59:37] it is christ that died ye rather that
[1:59:40] has risen again
[1:59:42] who is even at the right hand of god
[1:59:44] who also make us intercession
[1:59:47] for us
[1:59:49] hebrews 9 24 for christ has not entered
[1:59:51] into the holy place and made with hands
[1:59:52] which are the figures of the truth but
[1:59:54] into heaven itself
[1:59:57] now to appear
[1:59:59] in the presence of god
[2:00:02] for us
[2:00:04] and here's how you'll overcome
[2:00:07] revelation 12 11
[2:00:11] and they overcame him
[2:00:13] by the blood of the lamb
[2:00:15] and by the word of their testimony now
[2:00:18] many people try to use this scripture to
[2:00:20] say well we've got to have testimony and
[2:00:22] then just church i don't know what their
[2:00:23] scriptures even say it they never even
[2:00:25] had testimony services when this had
[2:00:27] been written
[2:00:28] it's your life
[2:00:29] it's what you say
[2:00:31] about you
[2:00:33] it's what you say it's what you live i'm
[2:00:35] not talking just from your mouth all the
[2:00:37] time i'm talking about the man in the
[2:00:39] engine room
[2:00:41] it's what you think about yourself from
[2:00:43] your deepest parts of your hearts you
[2:00:45] remember years and years ago whenever i
[2:00:47] preached on the titanic and how it was
[2:00:49] that which was submerged that brought
[2:00:51] down that which was so large and so
[2:00:54] visible and whatever we saw i believe i
[2:00:56] believe but it's not just this upper man
[2:00:58] up here on the outside that believes
[2:01:00] that's what the man in the engine room
[2:01:02] says the outside man oh yes i believe i
[2:01:04] believe but the man inside said yeah you
[2:01:06] believe he can do it but it won't do it
[2:01:07] for you
[2:01:08] and you see that man in the engine room
[2:01:11] is the one that dictates a lot about who
[2:01:13] we are and how much results we get in
[2:01:15] our life so we spend much of our time
[2:01:17] battling between the man out on the deck
[2:01:19] he's got the binoculars and he's looking
[2:01:21] around saying wow look at all that man
[2:01:23] they're that beautiful i know i can do
[2:01:25] it and the guy down the insurance said
[2:01:26] i'm scared to this oh no oh no god will
[2:01:28] do it but it won't do it for me you got
[2:01:30] to get them two guys together
[2:01:32] and if you can get them two guys
[2:01:34] together like the prophet said about the
[2:01:35] lord jesus he was so unconscious of his
[2:01:38] faith and god wants the real believers
[2:01:40] to i'm trying i'm trying to have faith
[2:01:43] no no no
[2:01:45] you need to let faith just so live
[2:01:47] itself out of you
[2:01:50] how many of y'all control your heartbeat
[2:01:52] at night when you're asleep
[2:01:56] how many regulate your blood pressure at
[2:01:58] night
[2:01:59] when you're asleep
[2:02:01] when god made us he made a wonderful
[2:02:03] thing many things he divide between the
[2:02:06] consciousness the first conscience and
[2:02:08] the subconscious
[2:02:10] you know that is you get so used to
[2:02:11] walking down steps you don't have to
[2:02:13] even look at them until you think about
[2:02:15] it you ever notice how that works
[2:02:17] and then you go to looking down steps
[2:02:19] that you've been down and you'll you'll
[2:02:20] miss it it's amazing i just did it the
[2:02:22] other day it's amazing how many you'll
[2:02:24] miss because you take it from the
[2:02:26] subconscious where it's committed to and
[2:02:28] then the conscience goes to doing it and
[2:02:30] the subconscious is trying to walk you
[2:02:32] but you won't let it
[2:02:33] yeah
[2:02:34] and that's what a real faith is and our
[2:02:36] soul real faith can look at the promise
[2:02:38] of god and say i don't understand it but
[2:02:40] i believe it anyhow
[2:02:42] i believe what he said praise the lord
[2:02:45] and the outside trying to figure it out
[2:02:46] and reason but your testimony is i'm
[2:02:49] saved i'm filled with the holy ghost i'm
[2:02:52] bright i am elect he loves me when there
[2:02:54] is a rapture or you say the rapture is
[2:02:56] already gone it can't be i'm still here
[2:03:00] and you need to have the kind of right
[2:03:02] kind of faith if there's only one going
[2:03:03] to have a happy valley you say brother
[2:03:04] donnie i love you pal but you better
[2:03:06] move to another church
[2:03:08] because i am going
[2:03:10] well no no you're probably everybody in
[2:03:12] the church will be for me you need to
[2:03:13] have the revelation lord god i'm going
[2:03:16] you died for me you come to set me free
[2:03:18] you sent the message from me i'm going
[2:03:21] that's my testimony that's who i am and
[2:03:25] the devil is accusing and accusing don't
[2:03:27] you notice
[2:03:28] this is the way they overcome it's like
[2:03:30] that wasn't even affected by what he
[2:03:32] said they was more affected by what they
[2:03:34] said
[2:03:35] than what he said
[2:03:37] so it was the blood of the lamb coupled
[2:03:38] together was what they were saying they
[2:03:41] were in christ jesus
[2:03:45] the believer's legal testimony
[2:03:48] has more sway in heaven
[2:03:50] than the devil's lying mouse
[2:03:53] [Music]
[2:03:56] god cannot admit lies into the court of
[2:03:59] evidence against you
[2:04:01] but he can and will admit your testimony
[2:04:07] as legal evidence
[2:04:10] well what if you said well i'm not sure
[2:04:12] i'm saved oh no i don't know i'm not
[2:04:14] sure if i believe the message you know i
[2:04:15] i'm not sure i'm not sure but you need
[2:04:17] to get sure you need to get sure then
[2:04:19] line your testimony right up with it
[2:04:21] that way your testimony can be admitted
[2:04:23] as evidence for your innocence
[2:04:27] so when the bride goes out of this place
[2:04:29] you're going to go and sir
[2:04:32] brother sister when satan comes down
[2:04:35] we think we're in trouble now all the
[2:04:38] world the earth has never been where
[2:04:40] it's at right now it is nothing nothing
[2:04:43] compared to what it's going to be
[2:04:45] in just a little while
[2:04:47] it'll be such a tragic change
[2:04:50] from one day
[2:04:52] to the next
[2:04:54] one day the bride will be here to set
[2:04:56] like this the bride will be here say
[2:04:58] tomorrow
[2:04:59] and then the lord jesus calls the
[2:05:01] rapture tomorrow evening
[2:05:03] by friday morning
[2:05:05] the change will be so catastrophic
[2:05:09] the world will not be able to comprehend
[2:05:13] what has happened
[2:05:15] then religious people will start going
[2:05:17] to church
[2:05:18] buildings will explode
[2:05:21] i hope they enjoy our new one
[2:05:24] i told carol today i hope i don't get to
[2:05:26] have one service here myself
[2:05:28] i hope we never even have to have a
[2:05:30] dedication service
[2:05:31] [Music]
[2:05:32] he said what do you mean i hope jesus is
[2:05:34] coming
[2:05:37] let the bank of tennessee have it
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:40] praise the lord
[2:05:42] [Applause]
[2:05:45] but people will run to the altar they'll
[2:05:47] scream they'll cry they'll get up and
[2:05:49] they'll feel so much better they'll feel
[2:05:51] so different how can you say that
[2:05:53] brother donnie they're doing it now
[2:05:55] the spirit of god has written
[2:05:58] ichabod over many of these church doors
[2:06:00] for years and they're still moved upon
[2:06:02] emotionally and feel like they're having
[2:06:04] a revival it's an intellectual gathering
[2:06:07] amen how grateful we ought to be to have
[2:06:09] a church where the spirit of god is
[2:06:10] welcome
[2:06:11] don't ever let us do nothing that'll
[2:06:13] grieve him children
[2:06:16] let's be our head shall we
[2:06:20] oh lord god
[2:06:24] heavenly father in one way these things
[2:06:27] are
[2:06:28] fearful no wonder you told us in the
[2:06:31] book of luke
[2:06:34] pray you therefore always that you may
[2:06:36] be accounted worthy to escape all these
[2:06:38] things
[2:06:40] that shall come to pass
[2:06:42] and stand before the son of man
[2:06:46] dear lord jesus we pray if there's one
[2:06:48] here tonight whose name is on that book
[2:06:52] and that name has not yet been finished
[2:06:56] they're not yet
[2:06:57] may be filled with the holy ghost they
[2:06:59] love you they love the message but
[2:07:01] they've not yet broke through
[2:07:04] in behind the veil
[2:07:05] may this be the night lord
[2:07:08] maybe it's somebody in canada streaming
[2:07:10] maybe it's
[2:07:11] somebody to tomorrow in austria or or
[2:07:14] newfoundland or greenland or iceland
[2:07:16] somewhere
[2:07:17] and they may go back and hear this
[2:07:19] service and
[2:07:20] something or strike their heart they're
[2:07:22] at home
[2:07:23] or on their job wherever they are oh
[2:07:26] lord god
[2:07:28] come lord jesus
[2:07:31] come lord
[2:07:32] take us away from this place
[2:07:36] our government is so rotten
[2:07:39] our school systems are so rotten that
[2:07:41] they're trying to teach our children
[2:07:44] without the knowledge of their parents
[2:07:47] all this transgender stuff
[2:07:50] walt disney even putting it in their
[2:07:53] cartoons
[2:07:55] to where males are kissing males oh sure
[2:07:57] they start out little and they see it in
[2:07:59] the cartoon
[2:08:00] and then it goes to impregnating their
[2:08:02] minds
[2:08:03] that that's the normal that is not the
[2:08:06] normal
[2:08:07] he made them male and female we don't
[2:08:11] believe in 14 genders we believe in two
[2:08:14] because that's what you made and we're
[2:08:16] not ashamed to say it tonight lord amen
[2:08:19] lord every day it's getting worse how
[2:08:22] much longer jesus
[2:08:24] like the children of israel of all they
[2:08:26] cried and they wept
[2:08:29] it's amazing to me that you sending
[2:08:31] their deliverance
[2:08:33] was timed with the voice of their cry
[2:08:35] because you told moses i have heard the
[2:08:38] groanings
[2:08:39] i have heard the crying the sighing of
[2:08:42] my children down there in the land of
[2:08:44] egypt
[2:08:45] and i'm sending you down to deliver them
[2:08:48] oh we have to be honest we've had it
[2:08:50] pretty easy really yeah
[2:08:52] but lord more and more i'm hearing it
[2:08:53] brother daryl tell me the other day
[2:08:55] everywhere he's traveling he's hearing
[2:08:56] people talk about it
[2:08:58] they're praying for the coming of the
[2:09:00] lord

[2:09:03] way but it's that old lazy human nature

[2:09:24] get rid of all of our burdens
