TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Oh God for we are despised and turned the reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from them before thee but they have provoked thee to anger before the builders now when we first opened up chapter 4 beginning with verse 1 it was sand the last and Tobias at was mad now we got God mad I dread the day with 385 billion nine hundred and seventy four thousand three hundred and thirty-two mad samba laughs and one mad dog so listen what they got so we decided that we would stay home and we would not go back to church again because it was too many hypocrites we decided we would go to Walmart and buy everybody a pair of shorts and we would buy makeup and we buy little beer as well and we just live the life of Riley so built we criticism never slowed them down really kill never slowed them down they made fun of never slowed them there they kept right on building the law that all fears never slow them down the failures of their fathers never slowed them down their own questions and their minds never slowed them down [Applause]
