[39:09] [Music]
[39:09] [Applause]
[39:29] praise the Lord amen Lord how many can
[39:33] say Amen to that the Lord's been so
[39:36] faithful to all of us for his
[39:39] Mercy what do we deserve nothing as far
[39:42] as his goodness and his
[39:44] Mercy but by his
[39:47] faithfulness that's something that I've
[39:50] observed and noticed as young Christians
[39:52] that when they get saved and they first
[39:55] start out on their journey and go
[39:56] through things of life it can be so hard
[39:59] for them so
[40:01] difficult cuz they pray and it seems
[40:03] like God
[40:04] delays part of that trust is built over
[40:08] years of
[40:10] faithfulness just like it is with a
[40:11] husband and
[40:13] wife you got a true wife a true husband
[40:16] somebody might accuse them of something
[40:17] but you say I don't believe that I know
[40:21] my wife I know my husband that's what it
[40:24] is with the Lord we go through things
[40:26] and we wonder Lord what what are you
[40:28] doing why are you allowing this I know
[40:32] you could move just like that if you
[40:35] would but when he doesn't he has a
[40:38] reason amen I'm glad we can trust him
[40:41] even when we don't understand W you
[40:44] thank you Lord amen we greet you today
[40:46] in the name of the Lord what a privilege
[40:48] it is for us to be gathered together
[40:50] here in the house of God let's turn to
[40:52] Isaiah 54 if you would
[40:55] today Isaiah 54
[40:59] verse we'll begin reading verse 4
[41:01] through ver
[41:04] 6 fear not for Thou shalt not be
[41:08] ashamed
[41:10] neither be thou
[41:13] confounded for Thou shalt not be put to
[41:17] shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of
[41:20] thy
[41:21] use and shall not remember the
[41:25] reproach of thy widowhood
[41:29] anymore for thy maker
[41:32] is
[41:34] thine say it with me husband husband the
[41:39] Lord of hosts is his name now what is he
[41:46] the
[41:47] Redeemer the Redeemer of the
[41:51] children of
[41:53] Israel the god of the whole earth he's
[41:56] the holy one the Redeemer now remember
[41:59] what he was to them in the Old Testament
[42:01] he is to us in the new the god of the
[42:04] whole Earth shall he be
[42:08] called and we know as far as creation
[42:11] and owning it all he does own it but sat
[42:15] Satan still has a squatter's claim on it
[42:18] he's not called God of the whole earth
[42:20] yet but he will be for the Lord has
[42:24] called thee as a woman for
[42:27] Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a
[42:31] wife of Youth in other words you got
[42:34] married when you were very very young
[42:37] but yet your husband was certainly not a
[42:39] good one was he a wife of use when thou
[42:43] was
[42:45] refused saith thy God and many' like to
[42:49] be remembered today as we pray and ask
[42:52] the Lord to help us um Brother Brad
[42:55] Gilbert is has an need of prayer he has
[42:58] a sep sepsis infection in his knee he
[43:02] sent me a picture of it last night it
[43:04] was absolutely awful though it's all
[43:07] swollen up so we certainly want to to
[43:10] remember him also I got a text with
[43:12] sister Lisa Lan and she also needed
[43:15] prayer today so let's just approach the
[43:17] Lord with this opportunity that he's
[43:20] given
[43:21] us father we come today not as Beggars
[43:26] not as
[43:28] slaves but we come as your people your
[43:31] people which are called by your
[43:34] name we've been given this channel of
[43:37] Prayer by which we could bring our needs
[43:40] our requests our desires into your
[43:43] presence we've already sensed you here
[43:45] Lord we thank you for this beautiful
[43:48] singing and how it creates an
[43:51] atmosphere I Marvel as I hear these
[43:53] talented people using their gift to
[43:57] bless your people that's why you give us
[44:00] gifts not to put them under a bushel or
[44:03] hide them or not make them available to
[44:06] benefit others so now we've come
[44:08] together each of us with our lick of
[44:10] fire that we can be able to receive from
[44:12] you today but not just receive but we're
[44:15] here to give back to you you're our
[44:19] husband and we love you what kind of
[44:21] home would it be if the husband was
[44:24] constantly giving and doing for the wife
[44:27] and the wife never done anything back
[44:30] for the husband or vice versa that but
[44:33] certainly not be a home of love we don't
[44:36] want our church just to be a place to
[44:38] where we're constantly asking you we
[44:41] want this we want that we need this we
[44:43] want that and then we Chad you when you
[44:46] don't answer when we sing what kind of
[44:49] church have we got but we want our
[44:51] church to be a place of Love Not only
[44:54] love for one another but love for you
[44:58] so we come not only to get today but we
[45:00] come to give back into your presence you
[45:04] heard all these needs that Justin read
[45:06] before I came out and these that have
[45:08] been made
[45:09] known father we pray for each of them
[45:12] would you help us today dear God help me
[45:15] to get out of the way you see Lord what
[45:17] I have before me I need your help guide
[45:21] me Lord Jesus shut my mouth to anything
[45:24] that would displease you may your
[45:26] presence Come and catch each of us into
[45:29] this special special place today we ask
[45:33] in the name of the Lord
[45:35] Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless
[45:39] you you may be
[45:49] seated what an awesome privilege has
[45:52] been given to us in this
[45:54] day to be able to stand
[45:58] before almighty God and before his
[46:03] people to be able to speak words
[46:06] that to some would be very
[46:09] foolish to some would be greatly
[46:12] misunderstood no
[46:14] doubt and I realized a long time ago
[46:17] that I'm not called to help everybody
[46:21] I'm not called to be everybody's Pastor
[46:23] I'm not called to be the one that would
[46:27] go here and there and there nor is any
[46:29] other man really each of us find our
[46:33] spot and there is where we stay and as
[46:37] long as God can help us to do that and I
[46:41] find it amazing because our lord Jesus
[46:44] has longed also for his place to be able
[46:48] to be in the church in the way that he
[46:52] wanted to be and we know the prophet
[46:54] tells us that he gets his place back in
[46:59] the end time now not with everyone not
[47:02] with everybody that even goes to church
[47:05] not even with everybody that says they
[47:06] are a Christian will he get his place
[47:09] because his true place is to be Lord in
[47:12] every one of our Lives we don't want him
[47:14] just to be savior do we we want him to
[47:16] be Lord Master where he can do with us
[47:19] whatever he he desires to do if he wants
[47:22] to Humble us so be it if he wishes to
[47:24] exalt italt us so be that that too
[47:27] whatever he wants is whatever
[47:29] surrendered child of God really wants so
[47:32] the Lord is pro prophetically saying
[47:35] that he's going to get his position in
[47:38] the church in the last day which would
[47:41] be what what is that position oh well
[47:44] he's he he's the savior of the body but
[47:47] that's where many people stop just to
[47:49] save them from hell and truly he is a
[47:52] great savior none like him but he
[47:54] doesn't just want to be that but he
[47:57] wants to be the one that we are actually
[48:00] married to so relate it today as it
[48:03] would be in your home those of you that
[48:05] are married you children that watch your
[48:08] mom and dad and see what a marriage
[48:10] relationship can be and you see that God
[48:14] picked out of all human relationships to
[48:16] identify himself with his church he
[48:19] could have chose a father and a daughter
[48:22] he could have chose a father and a son
[48:24] he could have chose many different Human
[48:27] Relationships but he chose what a man
[48:30] and his wife so what was the first human
[48:32] relationship on the earth a father and
[48:35] his daughter was it a mother and her son
[48:39] and you hear people say well I I was a
[48:41] I'm a mama's boy and you say well that's
[48:43] a daddy's girl now why do we say that
[48:45] because we can see there's a special
[48:48] relationship there and that's a
[48:49] wonderful relationship which is
[48:52] basically as far as the nominal churches
[48:54] go that God has chosen a relationship
[48:58] with the church as being father and
[49:01] children but we believe through the
[49:04] light of God that there's a higher
[49:06] relationship and a higher call that it's
[49:09] not just father and children but it's
[49:12] actually husband and wife so it's the
[49:16] man and his wife that was reflected in
[49:19] the Garden of Eden so God when he made
[49:21] the man and everything that God made he
[49:24] said it was good and he looked at all
[49:27] the substance that he brought in into
[49:29] the world all the beauty all the colors
[49:32] all the textures all the things that he
[49:34] made it must have been absolutely
[49:36] incredible then he makes the man but
[49:39] remember the man as long as he was in
[49:41] the god image the man could never fall
[49:45] but it's when the man was placed in the
[49:47] image of animal that he could fall so
[49:51] what was man's body as we are today the
[49:54] highest form of mammal life warm blooded
[49:58] animal so this is why in the
[50:00] resurrection no more blood because we
[50:04] lose that image of animal life this is
[50:08] why you take the spirit of God off of a
[50:10] human being they're lower than an animal
[50:13] they will do things an animal would
[50:16] never do is that right because they're a
[50:19] mammal with a soul and that Soul gives
[50:22] them a special status but only if they
[50:25] use it in the right way and then God of
[50:28] course looked at the man and the Lord
[50:31] God said it's not good that the man
[50:34] should be alone so where did he get that
[50:37] attribute of being lonely how in a world
[50:39] could you be lonely in absolute
[50:41] perfection so here you are on the earth
[50:44] you're the god of the earth everything
[50:46] does what you tell it to do it
[50:49] orchestrates by your command whatever
[50:51] you wanted to do speak it if you don't
[50:54] like the original order change it if you
[50:57] want a tree to be over there if you want
[50:59] this to be there say it that's all you
[51:01] have to do and it's moved at your
[51:04] command but yet he looked around and he
[51:07] saw the giraffes and there was two of
[51:09] them saw the Bears there were two horses
[51:12] two elephants two giraffe Impala januk
[51:18] all the different animals Two by Two by
[51:20] Two by Two but there was nothing found
[51:23] for him and then the Lord God opened up
[51:26] his side and brought a peculiar thing
[51:30] out of him he didn't I probably didn't
[51:33] even understand what he felt but he knew
[51:36] that there was something more than
[51:38] himself that he longed for Fellowship I
[51:40] don't know if he realized it or not that
[51:43] a lot of it was within him it had to be
[51:46] released though the image had to be
[51:49] smitten in order that it could come out
[51:52] so a part of it come out of him and a
[51:55] part of it was taken from around him so
[51:58] God opened up his side and took out a
[52:01] rib and then God went in the spirit and
[52:03] divided the feminist characteristics and
[52:06] put them inside this body that he had
[52:09] formed from Adam's Rib and it's amazing
[52:12] about the rib I don't know if you've
[52:14] ever studied about it or not but in the
[52:16] rib it's a it's a very odd part of the
[52:19] human body from the rib is found the DNA
[52:23] and the cells that make up other parts
[52:26] of the body so in taking the rib you've
[52:29] got other parts of the body condensed
[52:32] right in that rib form so God never made
[52:35] her from his foot so that she would be
[52:38] trampled on by this man God never made
[52:42] her a part of his head so that she would
[52:45] rule over him but God took her from
[52:49] where from under his heart right there
[52:52] in that portion of his body when Adam
[52:55] awakes out of that anesthesia and he
[52:58] looks there and immediately it was as we
[53:02] say love at first sight it must have
[53:05] been awesome their first few days and
[53:08] weeks and months we really don't even
[53:10] know how long they were there together
[53:13] it might have been Millennium because
[53:15] time didn't really matter anyway age
[53:18] didn't matter cuz they wasn't getting
[53:19] older and it must have been really
[53:22] something how that God mirrored his own
[53:25] desire in Adam and Eve now remember
[53:28] according to Genesis 5 and God made them
[53:31] male and female and called their name
[53:34] Adam so Eve was not called Eve until
[53:38] after she committed adultery so she got
[53:41] her own name after she received the seed
[53:45] of another being but in the beginning
[53:49] they were both called Adam so if you'd
[53:51] have walked up in the Garden of Eden
[53:52] said Adam they both would have said what
[53:56] because they were called by the same
[53:58] name now truly this is the perfect
[54:02] marriage in the Garden of Eden so we see
[54:05] this man and he gets his name from the
[54:07] home that he was taken up Adam Adam
[54:10] which means red and then we see the
[54:13] woman and she's perfect woman now the
[54:16] prophet tells us that she was God's
[54:19] thought or God's idea of what a perfect
[54:22] woman was what a perfect woman was God
[54:26] CHS her hair to be blonde God chose her
[54:30] eyes to be blue now we don't know
[54:33] exactly what color Adam's hair was and
[54:36] eyes but yet God chose them to be the
[54:40] very epitome of every son and daughter
[54:44] of God that would come thereafter and
[54:45] enter into holy matrimony but God not
[54:48] only mirrored us but he mirrored himself
[54:53] so God looked at them as they went to
[54:55] the Garden of Eden and they too began to
[54:59] bring something to God that God had not
[55:03] experienced in the creation of the
[55:05] myriads of stars that scientists are
[55:09] still finding out that there's worlds
[55:12] that are there that they're just seeing
[55:15] so we still don't know how many they are
[55:17] and yet he wrote every one of them out
[55:19] there that was his first Bible and he
[55:21] called them by name the last count that
[55:25] I had and and looking at it some months
[55:27] ago it was up into the
[55:32] septian
[55:34] septian that's a one was like 19
[55:38] zeros septian stars now that's in the
[55:43] visible Universe across what they call
[55:46] the elliptical plane which goes out as
[55:49] far as light can see it no telling how
[55:52] many more there are that they've not
[55:54] even found yet and yet that did not
[55:57] bring him satisfaction like it did when
[56:00] that man and woman was just kind of
[56:02] hanging out as we'd say in the Garden of
[56:05] Eden and they just get up of a morning
[56:08] and first thing of a morning maybe wash
[56:10] their face and go down in that river
[56:13] that was so pure and the fruits on the
[56:16] trees were absolutely
[56:19] incredible the leaves were were were
[56:22] beautiful and Brilliant green and and
[56:24] the yellows and the fruit and the Reds
[56:27] and the melons and the berries and
[56:30] because they were vegetarian and
[56:32] everything that they would eat was so
[56:35] tasty they were so tasty and the sky you
[56:39] and I have never seen the sky the way it
[56:42] was then we've never seen even the light
[56:44] of the Sun the way that it was then and
[56:47] the Earth how that it must have been and
[56:49] the air that that they breathed must
[56:52] have been so pure and so awesome and God
[56:56] God would come down every day just to
[56:58] fellowship with them he loved them so
[57:02] much and God himself stood them there as
[57:05] the prophet said and joined them
[57:08] together and he made it known to her you
[57:11] imagine that God as a pastor as many
[57:14] times I've been in in a hospital and
[57:17] maybe I would be the first one that
[57:19] would go in and and see someone from the
[57:21] church that had open heart surgery or
[57:24] they had some type of say uh that they
[57:26] had to have t taken place in their
[57:28] intensive care and I would be there
[57:30] praying for them my hand on their
[57:32] shoulder if it's a brother my hand in
[57:34] his hand and watch his eyes as they
[57:36] start batting and come open brother
[57:39] Donnie brother Donnie thank you the Lord
[57:44] was
[57:45] gracious I've been there many times and
[57:48] I'm the first face they see wow that
[57:50] would be scary wouldn't
[57:52] it but you imagine when Adam opened his
[57:55] eyes
[57:57] eyes and there's standing beside him a
[58:00] person that was not there before he went
[58:03] to
[58:04] sleep and maybe God told her go up near
[58:07] you know science has even proven that
[58:09] human touch can lower blood pressure it
[58:12] can level off it affects glucose it
[58:14] affects so many things in our body so
[58:17] Adam is coming out from under the
[58:19] anesthesia and he feels this strange
[58:22] feeling as she's touching him and he
[58:24] he's still trying to come out of it and
[58:27] he and he finally does and when he opens
[58:29] his eyes there is the most beautiful
[58:32] creature that he'd ever seen in his
[58:34] entire
[58:36] life and he says you
[58:40] are
[58:43] Isa because you came from ish you are
[58:49] woan or man with a
[58:53] womb because you came from
[58:57] man oh
[59:03] God and yet father
[59:06] knew that would not last
[59:10] forever he knew that when he brought
[59:12] them out of that image of God and placed
[59:14] them into that animal
[59:16] body in one way it would seem he was
[59:19] doing them a
[59:20] disfavor but actually he's going to
[59:23] express the fullness of all that he is
[59:27] he couldn't make them fall now but he
[59:30] put them in a realm where they could and
[59:32] they could choose and we know the story
[59:34] of course that they did
[59:37] choose and now this Garden this paradise
[59:40] turns into it was the most beautiful
[59:43] awesome wonderful place on the earth and
[59:46] me know that Adam's Body actually didn't
[59:49] come from the Garden of Eden it come
[59:53] from outside the proximity of the
[59:56] headquarters so the perfect the perfect
[59:59] reflection of what God wanted to be was
[1:00:02] called the Garden of Eden but Adam was
[1:00:04] actually made in Eden so Eden was like a
[1:00:07] state and the Garden of Eden was like a
[1:00:11] city so God brought Adam after he made
[1:00:14] him and placed him in the Garden of Eden
[1:00:17] he wasn't made there but Eve actually
[1:00:21] come out of Adam's Body when he reached
[1:00:25] the state
[1:00:26] of the Garden of Eden when he come to
[1:00:28] his
[1:00:30] place Eve could not come out of Adam as
[1:00:34] long as Adam was in Eden she could only
[1:00:38] come out of Adam when Adam was placed in
[1:00:42] the Garden of Eden which was his
[1:00:45] position now all that being said so that
[1:00:49] you could be able to realize the Lord
[1:00:51] Jesus in his
[1:00:53] greatness could not bring forth a bride
[1:00:56] in his own image until he himself
[1:01:01] started from the act of condens sension
[1:01:04] went as low as he could go then started
[1:01:07] ascending back up once he comes to his
[1:01:11] place then his bride can come to her
[1:01:15] place now we know that he started it out
[1:01:18] of course on the day of Pentecost now I
[1:01:21] am a Pentecostal by experience but I'm
[1:01:24] not a to in Pentecostal I hope you all
[1:01:28] today are Pentecostal by experience our
[1:01:30] lord Jesus come that same way so that he
[1:01:34] could come in the antitype that he could
[1:01:37] come through his Garden of Eden and he
[1:01:42] would give birth to his bride so where
[1:01:45] did God get the elements to make eeve
[1:01:48] well the most important element of
[1:01:50] course was her spirit her life but God
[1:01:53] also took a rib then from there we don't
[1:01:56] know if God reached over and got a
[1:01:57] little bit of dark dirt and a little bit
[1:01:59] of Red Dirt we don't know exactly what
[1:02:01] God did the Bible doesn't tell us but
[1:02:04] much of the contents of her body come
[1:02:06] from Adam's Body himself the structure
[1:02:10] and the Flesh and yet God opened up his
[1:02:13] spirit and took that out too and then
[1:02:16] there on the day of Pentecost when the
[1:02:18] day of Pentecost was fully come there
[1:02:21] come a great Mighty rushing wind so it
[1:02:24] was the church born of of natural
[1:02:27] elements she was born of Supernatural
[1:02:30] Elements by the Breath of God so what
[1:02:33] was it that happened there wasn't
[1:02:35] shouting alone it wasn't jumping and
[1:02:38] running and we we believe in all that do
[1:02:40] we not that's that affects our emotions
[1:02:42] of course but what God did was he
[1:02:45] brought himself down into one tiny blood
[1:02:50] cell and God created that blood cell in
[1:02:53] the womb of a virgin as brother Chuck
[1:02:55] was singing about a while ago the very
[1:02:57] reason that we can stand in this place
[1:03:00] today and God could say what sin are you
[1:03:03] talking about is because he himself come
[1:03:08] down into that one blood cell and put
[1:03:12] his own life in that one blood cell and
[1:03:15] when the blood cell was broken open at
[1:03:17] Calvary it released the life of God
[1:03:21] himself so the token then is not the
[1:03:24] chemistry of the blood but rather the
[1:03:27] life that was in the blood now watch
[1:03:31] this and question and answers the
[1:03:33] prophet said Jesus cannot come until a
[1:03:37] church a body of Believers and the
[1:03:41] ministry that he want now watch I was
[1:03:43] going to focus on this the ministry that
[1:03:46] he once had has to be the same as it was
[1:03:50] then too now watch so it's not just
[1:03:54] believing the same doct and believing
[1:03:56] the same theology but there must be a
[1:04:00] Ministry come on the earth that will
[1:04:03] match the original and he said them
[1:04:05] without us is not made perfect Paul said
[1:04:07] in Hebrews 11 without us they cannot be
[1:04:11] perfected they must have this ministry
[1:04:16] to raise up the Luther Wesley and all of
[1:04:20] them down Through the Ages so it's not
[1:04:23] just a restoration back to to the
[1:04:26] original word or the original spirit and
[1:04:29] it is but there must be a Ministry on
[1:04:32] the earth in the last day that will be
[1:04:36] like the ministry of Jesus himself so
[1:04:40] whose ministry will it be well people
[1:04:42] want say well it's that brother it's
[1:04:44] that brother it's that brother no
[1:04:46] actually it's not it's actually the
[1:04:49] ministry of Jesus himself now as I
[1:04:53] mentioned to you Wednesday night as far
[1:04:55] as my min Ministry personally I'm the
[1:04:57] only preacher in my Ministry Donnie
[1:05:00] Reagan but when it comes to the ministry
[1:05:02] of our church we have multiple different
[1:05:05] Ministries let me go ahead and just
[1:05:07] spill it to you if you're a Christian
[1:05:09] today every one of you actually have a
[1:05:13] Ministry now you may not handle the word
[1:05:15] and you may not preach and you may not
[1:05:17] cast out Devils but every believer has a
[1:05:21] god-given
[1:05:22] Ministry it might be praying for the
[1:05:25] preachers it might be writing cards and
[1:05:27] sending encouragement texts or emails or
[1:05:29] whatever but every one of you children
[1:05:32] of God have a Ministry can anybody say
[1:05:35] Amen to that so there must be a Ministry
[1:05:39] on the earth so when the Lord Jesus
[1:05:41] started out then it was just himself
[1:05:45] what was the very next step that he did
[1:05:48] he called Disciples so for those who
[1:05:51] don't believe that the Lord will have a
[1:05:54] a Ministry in the last day of preachers
[1:05:56] that will be true if he does not there's
[1:05:59] no need in you lay it to even trying
[1:06:02] because the first Lord Jesus in his
[1:06:04] Advent to the Earth he himself came and
[1:06:07] started preaching then the very next
[1:06:10] step was don't step over the preachers
[1:06:14] and go directly to Mary Magdalene and
[1:06:16] all the rest of those sisters and
[1:06:18] brothers but the very next step was out
[1:06:22] of him he would get other men and they
[1:06:25] would start proclaiming the same thing
[1:06:28] he now that's the ministry come on say
[1:06:31] amen that's the ministry of the way he
[1:06:34] started it so watch the prophet said
[1:06:36] then they must have this ministry to
[1:06:40] raise up the Luther the West the Wesley
[1:06:43] and all the rest of them down Through
[1:06:45] the Ages when that come that part of
[1:06:48] where the Eagles are gathered just as
[1:06:50] the carcass is the Eagles will be
[1:06:52] gathered together so the resurrection
[1:06:54] cannot come
[1:06:56] until the Lord Jesus accomplishes the
[1:06:59] very same thing in the last days that he
[1:07:03] started in the first day now he could
[1:07:05] have started it out without preachers if
[1:07:08] that's what he wanted if he wanted just
[1:07:10] to start it out with people that would
[1:07:12] just meet every now and then and if you
[1:07:14] wanted to start out we we'll say with
[1:07:16] tapes he could have allowed the tape
[1:07:18] recorder to have been invented in 32 ad
[1:07:23] or 30 or whenever because science has
[1:07:26] been around for a long long time he
[1:07:29] could if he wanted it to be books he
[1:07:31] could have had all types of his books
[1:07:33] that would have been printed then and
[1:07:35] they said now this is the way I'm going
[1:07:36] to start my church I'm going to start my
[1:07:39] church this way that what you're going
[1:07:40] to do you're going to go out and you're
[1:07:42] going to evangelize and you're going to
[1:07:43] give people tapes or you're going to
[1:07:45] give them books and then what they'll do
[1:07:47] they'll set it home and there'll be
[1:07:49] secret disciples there's no need to
[1:07:52] assemble yourselves together we'll just
[1:07:54] be secret disciples
[1:07:56] if that's what he wanted don't you think
[1:07:58] he could have done that 2,000 years ago
[1:08:01] well if he started out his church the
[1:08:03] way that he did according to the gospel
[1:08:06] and way the book of Acts relates it how
[1:08:08] is it that we've got it in the last day
[1:08:10] that people think he's going to end it
[1:08:13] in a total different way than the way he
[1:08:16] started it I mean maybe I don't
[1:08:18] understand it but to me that does not
[1:08:20] fulfill Hebrews 138 that he's the same
[1:08:24] yesterday today and
[1:08:27] forever notice in the Harvest time now
[1:08:30] doesn't Malachi 4 teach us that before
[1:08:32] the great and terrible day of the Lord
[1:08:34] shall come that this will take place how
[1:08:36] many knows that he will restore the
[1:08:38] hearts of the children to the fathers is
[1:08:40] that right the face of the original
[1:08:44] Pentecostal fathers original not 1906
[1:08:48] original Pentecostal fathers the son of
[1:08:51] man the word living itself a again
[1:08:56] amongst the people now listen carefully
[1:08:58] some of the things I'm going to share
[1:08:59] with you this morning it might take you
[1:09:01] a little bit to be able to comprehend it
[1:09:03] the word itself made flesh in you you
[1:09:09] are a reflection of this hour the
[1:09:13] message you are a reflection of this
[1:09:17] hour the message now I've said it to you
[1:09:20] before but think of how many years that
[1:09:23] the original Church preached the gospel
[1:09:26] and they did not have one written book
[1:09:29] of the New Testament now historians date
[1:09:31] First Corinthians and possibly Galatians
[1:09:34] maybe to be one of the first books that
[1:09:36] was actually written down which was
[1:09:38] around 59 ad and yet the church was
[1:09:43] given birth at 33 ad what in the world
[1:09:47] did they preach for 25 or 26 or 27 years
[1:09:52] whatever it was what did they preach
[1:09:54] they didn't have the Book of Matthew
[1:09:56] they didn't have the four gospels they
[1:09:58] did not have the book of of Acts which
[1:10:01] Luke wro wrote years and years later
[1:10:04] they did not have Corinthians and
[1:10:06] Galatians and Philippians and Ephesians
[1:10:08] and filimon first and second
[1:10:10] Thessalonians and F second Timothy they
[1:10:13] didn't have any of that stuff what did
[1:10:15] they preach they had and preached a
[1:10:18] living Christ they had the Old Testament
[1:10:21] and no doubt the spirit of God would
[1:10:23] lead them oh my people people criticize
[1:10:26] us today because we still read and
[1:10:28] preach from the Old Testament where do
[1:10:31] you think that original church Preach
[1:10:33] from they preach from the types and the
[1:10:36] Shadows of the Old Testament there was
[1:10:39] no Book of Matthew there was no Book of
[1:10:42] Mark there was no Book of Luke oh I wish
[1:10:45] somebody would preach with me do you
[1:10:46] realize that the 12 apostles had all
[1:10:49] died except for John before the New
[1:10:52] Testament ever even come and written
[1:10:55] form so what did they preach they
[1:10:58] preached what he told them to originally
[1:11:02] go and make disciples of all
[1:11:06] Nations now this is what the bridegroom
[1:11:09] himself did surely he's the one he's the
[1:11:12] one who wants a wife he's the one who
[1:11:15] needs to give to us the description of
[1:11:18] what is idea of the perfect woman is so
[1:11:21] we'll say as I referred to it a week or
[1:11:23] so ago we'll say that he had list and he
[1:11:27] had this list of his choice his
[1:11:29] prerogatives his view his personal taste
[1:11:32] now every man that's sitting here today
[1:11:34] that got married and you saw that woman
[1:11:36] that you met many many years ago and
[1:11:39] there might have been other women that
[1:11:40] you were kind of interested in but this
[1:11:42] one woman just really stuck out to you
[1:11:46] and she you felt like would meet what
[1:11:48] you thought a real wife would be and
[1:11:51] what your desire would be well God of
[1:11:54] course had that same desire he wanted a
[1:11:57] wife a bride well he himself was the one
[1:12:00] now that makes the requirement all right
[1:12:03] I want her to be this way I don't want
[1:12:05] her to be like that I want her to have a
[1:12:07] certain trait I want her to makeup to be
[1:12:10] like this of course first of all I want
[1:12:11] her to love me I want her to accept my
[1:12:14] headship above everything else and then
[1:12:17] God be to designate well he himself when
[1:12:19] he was sh didn't tell us exactly what he
[1:12:21] wanted but he had his men in that first
[1:12:25] Century to begin to write it down now
[1:12:28] remember the church was new as it was
[1:12:30] the devil didn't even know understand
[1:12:32] about the church Jesus was the first one
[1:12:34] to use that word so it was new the devil
[1:12:37] had to learn how the church is going to
[1:12:38] operate how it's going to function so he
[1:12:41] had to watch it as it unfolded they
[1:12:43] never had a church before only in types
[1:12:45] and shadows of the Old Testament so even
[1:12:48] the apostles themselves wasn't sure what
[1:12:51] is a church what does that mean a church
[1:12:53] well we know according to the Greek word
[1:12:56] that they use to write that it is a
[1:12:58] group of people called out of their
[1:13:00] homes Ecclesia a group of people called
[1:13:04] out of their homes to meet in a certain
[1:13:08] place I still believe the meaning of
[1:13:10] that same word don't you so you know
[1:13:12] whenever they started doing that who was
[1:13:14] it that told them to do that way well it
[1:13:17] wasn't Jesus Jesus was not the one that
[1:13:20] said forsake not the assembling of
[1:13:22] yourselves together Paul said that not
[1:13:24] Jesus but where did Paul get it he got
[1:13:27] it from the bridegroom himself then
[1:13:29] whenever they'd go out and begin to
[1:13:31] preach and they'd go up and down through
[1:13:32] the coast of cre and they'd go into
[1:13:34] caposa they'd go to thessalonica they'd
[1:13:36] go to all these cities well what do they
[1:13:39] do when they get there you know they've
[1:13:40] never started a church before what do we
[1:13:42] do the spirit of the bridegroom began to
[1:13:46] move on these men with a dispensational
[1:13:49] anointing and it was the first
[1:13:52] Foundation of a church so what did these
[1:13:53] men begin to do that they start handing
[1:13:56] out whenever the Bibles become into PR
[1:13:58] all right now what you need to do is you
[1:13:59] need to take Matthew and make Mark Luke
[1:14:01] and John and just you know just kind of
[1:14:03] hang out don't risk your lives now this
[1:14:05] is going to be really risky you can be a
[1:14:07] secret believer there's no need to
[1:14:10] gather out and let everybody make fun of
[1:14:12] you and ridicule you well just believe
[1:14:14] this word but stay at home I mean you
[1:14:17] know that it's really a shame to me that
[1:14:19] the Lord Jesus didn't understand the
[1:14:21] perfect way to start a church because a
[1:14:23] lot of them first century second and
[1:14:25] third century Christians wouldn't have
[1:14:27] had to Die the death of a martyr because
[1:14:30] they went to church if they could have
[1:14:31] been secret Christians and nobody knew
[1:14:33] that they were Christian you know they
[1:14:35] could just kind of stayed at home and
[1:14:37] stayed away from everybody that was one
[1:14:39] of the reasons they got killed because
[1:14:41] they were not ashamed of their
[1:14:43] Christianity they were not ashamed to go
[1:14:46] to the house of gods I've told you I've
[1:14:47] stood right there in those catacombs
[1:14:49] around Rome and it's an awesome type of
[1:14:51] a thing when you go there and realize
[1:14:53] some of our brothers and sister sisters
[1:14:55] would meet there under the city and they
[1:14:57] would have church but there was a drive
[1:15:00] inside of them there was something about
[1:15:03] coming together there was something
[1:15:05] about singing and worshiping I still
[1:15:07] agree don't you there's something about
[1:15:09] it so the ministry then was not a
[1:15:12] Ministry to where everybody just kind of
[1:15:14] lived their own life so the Christians
[1:15:16] in caposa they went this way the
[1:15:18] Christians of thessalonica they went
[1:15:20] that way and they never come together
[1:15:22] they never talk they never Fellowship
[1:15:25] that was not the choice of the
[1:15:27] bridegroom so the ministry then that
[1:15:30] followed on after the Lord Jesus left
[1:15:32] was actually the continuation of his own
[1:15:36] Ministry and under that influence of
[1:15:39] that great anointing the prophet tells
[1:15:41] us in that first seal that it was his
[1:15:44] own influence that influenced that age
[1:15:48] but it's amazing because time we come to
[1:15:50] the second age third age fourth age
[1:15:52] fifth age and sixth age it's not his own
[1:15:56] influence anymore but there is a promise
[1:16:00] I will restore sayith the Lord so it's
[1:16:03] not just a promise doctrinally it's not
[1:16:07] just a promise I'll restore the same
[1:16:10] water baptism and their Worship in a
[1:16:12] similar way but it is a restoration of
[1:16:16] personal Ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:16:20] himself it was not thus in the days of
[1:16:23] Luther or Wesley or for Pentecost now I
[1:16:26] don't want to hurt your feelings already
[1:16:27] but I have to say it this way that every
[1:16:30] man around this message that claims he's
[1:16:32] a preacher is not really a god- called
[1:16:34] man as I said before every preacher is
[1:16:36] not a man of God but every man of God is
[1:16:38] a preacher but every preacher that
[1:16:41] preaches is not necessarily A godall man
[1:16:44] many of them are Kingdom Builders many
[1:16:46] are are men that they want a big name
[1:16:48] for them themselves that's not a man of
[1:16:50] God well come on many of them are
[1:16:52] nothing but sers of Discord Division and
[1:16:55] so on again that's not another man of
[1:16:58] God because the ministry of Jesus
[1:17:01] reincarnated in his church is not a
[1:17:04] Ministry of division so it's not going
[1:17:07] to be one that's going to divide the
[1:17:09] sheep and and debate and argue and fuss
[1:17:12] and split this group and split that
[1:17:15] group in order to get a following to
[1:17:17] them that is not the ministry of Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ now what's this the prophet again
[1:17:22] says that you are a reflection of this
[1:17:25] hour the message of reflection of it see
[1:17:28] you live again live the life that was in
[1:17:31] Jesus Christ you're in the presence of
[1:17:34] the Sun s so n the life that was in the
[1:17:38] shuck went out in the wheat the life
[1:17:40] won't change the carriers change they
[1:17:43] denominate see the blades the tossel the
[1:17:45] Shu but the wheat can't change it's got
[1:17:49] to be a
[1:17:51] Ministry just exactly on the word like
[1:17:55] he was on the word so notice those who
[1:17:58] are promoting that we don't any longer
[1:18:01] need a Ministry don't you see where
[1:18:04] they're getting their
[1:18:06] inspiration Satan knows if the ministry
[1:18:10] of Christ
[1:18:11] Jesus is not replicated in this day
[1:18:16] there will be no
[1:18:17] Resurrection or
[1:18:20] Rapture it's not just going to be a a
[1:18:23] restoration back to the original
[1:18:25] Doctrine it must be a Ministry now don't
[1:18:28] argue with me just argue with a man you
[1:18:30] say you follow now watch like the first
[1:18:33] church was on the word spirit filled
[1:18:36] word fed not denominational fed but word
[1:18:40] fed and the church said watch this
[1:18:43] there's a man here can turn on the light
[1:18:46] when a man in a Foundry is making a belt
[1:18:48] he's got a certain tone he's put in it
[1:18:51] when he's setting his mold and pouring
[1:18:53] his iron he puts in so much brass so
[1:18:56] much steel so much copper why he knows
[1:18:59] exactly how much to put in to make to
[1:19:02] give it the right tone that's what Jesus
[1:19:05] has done by his bride he had to put so
[1:19:09] much looser so much Methodist so much
[1:19:14] Presbyterian so much Pentecost but what
[1:19:17] does he come out with his own reflection
[1:19:21] what is it just like a pyramid message

[1:19:46] that hang around the message that don't

[1:21:39] like
[1:21:41] unto the son of
[1:21:44] man now it was a being that looked
[1:21:49] like the son of
[1:21:53] man one like unto the son of man clothed
[1:21:58] with a garment down to the foot and G
[1:22:01] about the pths with a golden
[1:22:05] girdle ah I hope you can receive this
[1:22:07] next

[1:22:17] form
[1:22:20] sir you see you simply changed his Veil
[1:22:24] from his
[1:22:26] Prophet to his
[1:22:29] bride now watch's this in the seven
[1:22:32] Church ages the prophet says it this way
[1:22:35] referring to the scripture now that's
[1:22:36] the Bible that's what the spirit said
[1:22:39] see the candle notice this the
[1:22:42] candlesticks all right verse 13 in the
[1:22:45] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:22:47] one likened to the son of man what one
[1:22:50] like him who was this yes
[1:23:00] his bride one
[1:23:03] like
[1:23:06] him oh Lord Jesus watch How It Was
[1:23:09] clothed with the Garment down to the
[1:23:11] foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ
[1:23:15] covering
[1:23:16] her has washed us from our sins with his
[1:23:21] own blood guard about the PS
[1:23:25] not a man not a man a woman yes
[1:23:31] sir Lord
[1:23:34] children one like unto the son of man
[1:23:39] who is it the son of man's
[1:23:45] wife Lord
[1:23:47] God not a man a woman with a golden
[1:23:52] girdle the gospel that held the power
[1:23:54] power and glory of God over the body of
[1:23:59] Christ The Gospel the hell the power of
[1:24:02] God and glory of God the power and glory
[1:24:06] of God is held over the body what are we
[1:24:08] talking about the bride is his mystical
[1:24:13] body that's right can you imagine when
[1:24:16] John looks and sees that image that
[1:24:19] image laid down Revelation for all those
[1:24:22] years until the last days when God
[1:24:25] allows a prophet to peer in to another
[1:24:29] prophet's vision and he sees somebody
[1:24:32] there that had been hid from Millennia
[1:24:34] and who did he see one likened to the
[1:24:38] son of
[1:24:41] man but it was the
[1:24:43] bride brass he says let me not skip this
[1:24:47] oh what a beautiful picture we got here
[1:24:50] under
[1:24:52] consideration I hope y'all can take it
[1:24:54] this morning under
[1:24:57] consideration brass always is Judgment
[1:25:00] you know the Brazen Altar and the brass
[1:25:01] Serpent and so forth BR speaks of
[1:25:04] judgment his feet then now watch when
[1:25:08] John sees the Sevenfold personage of the
[1:25:10] Lord Jesus and he does his hair his eyes
[1:25:13] his voice all of that and then he goes
[1:25:15] down to the foundation which is the
[1:25:17] bottom where his feet are and he saw his
[1:25:19] feet as as fine brass burned in the
[1:25:21] furnace then watch the prophet as he
[1:25:23] brings this feminist image out of this
[1:25:26] his feet then the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:25:30] is to set upon Divine
[1:25:34] judgment you imagine we creatures which
[1:25:37] were born into this world and born
[1:25:40] condemned born judged as soon as you see
[1:25:44] a naval the prophet said when you see a
[1:25:46] naval on that human being it's a sign of
[1:25:49] a
[1:25:50] renegade and we were born attached to
[1:25:53] our mother
[1:25:54] we were born lost without God we were
[1:25:58] born seemingly with no hope but before
[1:26:01] you ever took on that image of your
[1:26:04] mother and your father you were already
[1:26:07] seen by John in the Book of Revelation
[1:26:11] in the image reflected by the son of
[1:26:15] man Hallelujah you were in him before
[1:26:20] you was ever in your father you were in
[1:26:24] him before your mother ever carried you
[1:26:28] you were in
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:32] him thank you Lord
[1:26:35] Jesus then the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:26:38] has set upon Divine judgment Christ
[1:26:41] dying in our stead the just one paying
[1:26:44] for our judgment up there before God
[1:26:48] died there as a sinner that's right on
[1:26:51] the
[1:26:52] cross and he Soul descended into
[1:26:56] hell now watch and he picks up this
[1:26:59] other part of that
[1:27:01] scripture and this is what John heard in
[1:27:04] the symbol that he had a
[1:27:06] voice of many
[1:27:10] Waters and the prophet goes on to say
[1:27:13] watch it's the
[1:27:16] church speaking
[1:27:25] but I want you to realize this he
[1:27:26] doesn't say just
[1:27:28] preachers amen you have a voice brother
[1:27:34] sister you have a voice well brother
[1:27:36] don't what you talking about what can I
[1:27:37] do what can I say I I don't know how to
[1:27:39] describe you know I don't know how to
[1:27:41] describe the word and the doctrines and
[1:27:43] this and that but can you tell how the
[1:27:45] fire got
[1:27:46] lit can you tell all I know I was once
[1:27:50] blind but now I see I was once lost but
[1:27:53] now delivered I I can't explain it all
[1:27:56] of what they believe brother Donnie can
[1:27:58] preach it and these other brothers can
[1:27:59] preach it I can't explain it but all I
[1:28:02] know is I've seen sick folks get healed
[1:28:04] in our assembly I've seen the dead get
[1:28:07] raised you saw yourself right back here
[1:28:10] some months ago I have seen the Lord do
[1:28:13] this and do that I don't know how it all
[1:28:15] works but I have seen it with my own
[1:28:18] eyes I know that I was born wretched it
[1:28:21] seemed like I had no hope but my rection
[1:28:24] has been changed heavenward I am not the
[1:28:27] person that I was sounds like to me
[1:28:29] you're sharing how the fire god lit you
[1:28:33] may not be able to explain about
[1:28:35] predestination and election you may not
[1:28:37] be able to make perfect sense like
[1:28:39] someone else could but what you know is
[1:28:42] that you was on your way to Hell
[1:28:44] seemingly and the Lord Jesus got a hold
[1:28:46] to you it wasn't you looking for him it
[1:28:49] was him looking for you you didn't even
[1:28:52] want him you didn't even want nothing to
[1:28:55] do with his word that he got a hold to
[1:28:58] you because you were identified in the
[1:29:02] image of the son of
[1:29:10] man watch it's the church
[1:29:15] speaking to him now
[1:29:19] Waters Revelation 17:15 Waters meant
[1:29:22] thickness and multitudes of people now
[1:29:24] his voice or this being that was
[1:29:27] standing there looking like this
[1:29:31] Christ in his
[1:29:33] church as a bride in Christ being one
[1:29:36] like husband and wife is one the church
[1:29:39] in Christ being molded together right
[1:29:43] with one

[1:30:24] end of the small size or the medium
[1:30:26] whatever we're looking at I may be
[1:30:28] halfway down or down to the other end of
[1:30:30] it and I'll pick out something and
[1:30:31] she'll pick out exactly the same thing
[1:30:33] on the other end so we've been so much
[1:30:36] alike and we're so close together that a
[1:30:38] lot of our thoughts are the same you see
[1:30:41] those that get married right off and
[1:30:42] they go to heaven ups and downs give it
[1:30:44] a little bit of time you'll merge
[1:30:46] together or you said Brother D I'm

[1:31:04] one and one and unity oh you I could
[1:31:06] never do that I'm a macho man are you
[1:31:08] any more Macho than almighty God
[1:31:11] almighty God had to come down on the
[1:31:13] earth and become like us that he might
[1:31:16] make us like him Hallelujah he could not
[1:31:20] stay there in heaven and say come on up
[1:31:22] children if you can he knew I couldn't
[1:31:24] even jump a foot off the ground so he
[1:31:27] come down to the Earth and said can't
[1:31:29] since you can't come to me I'll come to
[1:31:31] you I will come to you oh but brother
[1:31:34] Donnie I've got so many mistakes I do
[1:31:36] too but I refuse to let my mistakes
[1:31:39] Define my identity I am not known by my
[1:31:44] mistakes I am not known in eternity by
[1:31:48] my shortcoming I am known by my source
[1:31:53] my source of originality tells who I
[1:31:56] am Hallelujah I was in
[1:32:00] [Applause]
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:06] him as a bride in Christ being one like
[1:32:09] husband and wife is one the church in
[1:32:12] Christ being
[1:32:15] molded
[1:32:18] together it's
[1:32:21] divine epoxy
[1:32:27] you all know is whether it's paint or
[1:32:29] whether it is that you're putting
[1:32:30] together so you have a part a alpha and
[1:32:35] you have a Part B all you guessed it
[1:32:38] bride so you take equal parts and you go
[1:32:42] to mix together now depending on the
[1:32:43] setting how they've chemically
[1:32:44] orchestrated that on some of the ones
[1:32:46] I've used before you got 90 seconds some
[1:32:49] of you may have 5 minutes some of you
[1:32:51] may have 30 minutes just depending on
[1:32:52] what you're doing you know they use use
[1:32:54] it in gr they use it in all different
[1:32:55] types of things and they use it in paint
[1:32:57] to paint your garage floor so it'll make
[1:32:59] it more hard and more sturdy the Lord
[1:33:01] knew better than just to give me a
[1:33:03] portion of his spirit and not merge men
[1:33:05] him together I'd never be able to endure
[1:33:08] Leo deia can't you understand why the
[1:33:10] epoxy was not needed in the days of
[1:33:12] Luther the epoxy was not needed in the
[1:33:15] days of wesy but the epoxy strength is
[1:33:17] needed in this last day because all hell
[1:33:20] has broke loose and the gates of hell
[1:33:23] are opening wide open and hell has
[1:33:25] opened up her mouth and the Lord said I
[1:33:28] can't just let them go in on a shout I
[1:33:31] can't let him go in on just a bunch of
[1:33:33] emotion but I must go down I must go
[1:33:37] down I must mix myself a with her part B
[1:33:42] and when we stir
[1:33:44] together there will rise an invincible
[1:33:49] Army that will make
[1:33:51] hell tremble
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:58] all
[1:34:02] right notice the prophet said the things
[1:34:04] that Christ did the church does also do
[1:34:08] you see it that beautiful oh my that
[1:34:13] beautiful listen this
[1:34:15] church there is Holiness there she's
[1:34:20] standing standing in the image of
[1:34:21] Holiness in holiness
[1:34:24] in power in Majesty with seeing visions
[1:34:29] signs
[1:34:31] wonders everything just like he did here
[1:34:37] it is on Earth giving all praise to God
[1:34:39] saying I can do nothing except the
[1:34:41] father shows me you see this is what
[1:34:43] separates them from Kingdom building

[1:35:09] to Rally around you to make you the
[1:35:11] Great Hero I only have one hero his name
[1:35:14] is the Lord
[1:35:16] Jesus I love men of God but I have no no
[1:35:20] absolutely none whatsoever none that I
[1:35:22] put my ultimate confidence in because
[1:35:24] all men will let you down all men will
[1:35:27] fail you I don't care how good they are
[1:35:28] I don't care how much Holy Ghost they
[1:35:29] are they're still in an animal body if
[1:35:32] you only to get one thing out of the
[1:35:33] service today get this you are baptized
[1:35:36] by the holy ghost in your soul but you
[1:35:39] are still captured in an animal house it
[1:35:42] will bother you every day you live on

[1:36:02] body which matches your
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:11] soul notice say here it is on Earth
[1:36:13] giving all praise to God saying I can do
[1:36:15] nothing except what the father shows me
[1:36:17] but he showed me and here it is they
[1:36:19] come see these things now Christ MOS it
[1:36:23] into one and the voice of many Waters
[1:36:28] many
[1:36:29] people not just the
[1:36:33] one it was the whole
[1:36:36] church the seven churches molded
[1:36:39] together as one great ransomed body of
[1:36:43] the
[1:36:45] Lord can't you see when the apoxy power
[1:36:48] comes together in the last days it will
[1:36:51] cause the resurrection
[1:36:54] Paul is waiting on you Peter is waiting
[1:36:57] on you oh they love it the theop don't
[1:36:59] get me wrong they're not bored they're
[1:37:01] not unhappy but you know what they ain't
[1:37:02] eat one bite since they've been
[1:37:06] there that's what they told the prop
[1:37:08] would be on the C of times he was
[1:37:09] curious he said do you all eat here he
[1:37:11] said no we don't eat
[1:37:12] here but one day we go back to Earth and
[1:37:17] take up bodies to eat in there we will
[1:37:21] eat and drink and be a continuation of
[1:37:25] this same life the power of God that
[1:37:28] will Embrace this bride in the last day
[1:37:30] will be so strong it will force the
[1:37:35] resurrection it will cause Hallelujah
[1:37:39] tens of millions of people that are
[1:37:43] waiting on this moment to get up out of
[1:37:46] the earth can't you see why it takes
[1:37:47] more than just a little anointing
[1:37:49] that'll make a shout it must be he
[1:37:51] himself living out of us oh children if
[1:37:54] we could just get out of the way and let
[1:37:56] him live through us let him speak to us
[1:37:59] let him witness her let him do it to
[1:38:04] us notice this in the mark of the beast
[1:38:07] this is the night after this one that I
[1:38:09] just read from we want to pick up on our
[1:38:12] subject from last night last night we
[1:38:15] taken on the church ages and that how we
[1:38:18] saw
[1:38:19] Jesus standing in the
[1:38:22] church speaking as the
[1:38:25] voice of many Waters he had hair like
[1:38:29] wool eyes like flames of fire we found
[1:38:31] out that those Flames like swords a
[1:38:35] sword went out of his mouth a two-edged
[1:38:37] sword and we found out that was the word
[1:38:40] of God that went
[1:38:41] forth from the church's
[1:38:48] mouth and they would even cut to the mar
[1:38:50] of the bone and a discerner of the
[1:38:52] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:38:54] Hebrews the 4th
[1:38:56] chapter again the Seal of God he was on
[1:38:59] a rooll if you'll follow these serices
[1:39:01] right where he's at there in 1954 at the
[1:39:03] Tabernacle he's really on a roll his
[1:39:06] voice was a voice of many Waters both
[1:39:10] Christ and the
[1:39:13] church
[1:39:15] speaking
[1:39:18] together so Jesus can't say he's the
[1:39:20] same yesterday and forever and the
[1:39:22] church said well in a certain
[1:39:26] way his voice won't merge with
[1:39:31] that Oh Glory both Christ and the church
[1:39:35] speaking together with a golden girdle
[1:39:38] around the breast
[1:39:40] part of the
[1:39:45] church so here you've got this image
[1:39:48] it's not like the Colossus that
[1:39:51] Nebuchadnezzar s and man your soul right
[1:39:55] but this
[1:39:56] one glory to
[1:39:59] God it's Christ
[1:40:03] imor into the bride's
[1:40:07] body remember that's the Greek word that
[1:40:10] the prophet used when he said it was
[1:40:12] like an actor that an actor would go
[1:40:14] play one part and dress up a certain
[1:40:16] part then he go in behind the scene and
[1:40:18] he changed his clothes and come back out
[1:40:21] and he was another person
[1:40:23] Christ imorph himself into his profit in
[1:40:27] the last day to break the seals come on
[1:40:30] somebody and Christ is still here IM
[1:40:34] morphing himself into his bride's body
[1:40:36] open the da that mean we'll all produce
[1:40:38] the sign of the son of man no that's not
[1:40:40] our part of the ministry of the son of
[1:40:43] man the prophet told us that's one to a
[1:40:47] generation one to a generation I'm not
[1:40:50] looking for somebody else to come and
[1:40:51] discern this and discern that that
[1:40:53] that's one to a
[1:40:55] generation but I have my part you have
[1:40:58] your part you have your part in the
[1:41:00] ministry of the Lord Jesus well I cannot
[1:41:03] cause this myself the preachers cannot
[1:41:06] cause this Resurrection it's when the
[1:41:09] bride body gets under that anointing but
[1:41:11] instead we focus on our houses we focus
[1:41:14] on this and we focus on that and we
[1:41:16] argue and debate and fuss it ain't no
[1:41:18] wonder the devil wants us to do that
[1:41:21] can't you see why he wants you to get
[1:41:23] your mind off of the Resurrection he
[1:41:26] wants you to get your mind off of the
[1:41:28] Rapture he wants you to get your mind
[1:41:31] off of your
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:39] position his voice was the voice of many
[1:41:42] Waters both Christ and the church
[1:41:44] speaking together with a golden
[1:41:48] girdle about the breast part of the
[1:41:51] church covered over holding the
[1:41:55] gospel holding the righteousness of
[1:41:59] Christ so the golden
[1:42:01] girdle was holding the church holding
[1:42:06] this
[1:42:07] righteousness around
[1:42:09] her John didn't see the bride out there
[1:42:11] with their hands on the top of this
[1:42:14] garment holding it don't take it don't
[1:42:17] take
[1:42:20] it she wasn't holding righteous
[1:42:24] righteousness was holding
[1:42:26] [Applause]
[1:42:30] her she's just standing there allowing
[1:42:33] the Lord God to dress
[1:42:37] her and he knew how it would be with her
[1:42:41] Humanity The Winds of failure had he
[1:42:44] hung that garment Loosely bound around
[1:42:46] her The Winds of failure The Winds of
[1:42:49] mistake The Winds of shortcoming would
[1:42:51] come and blow that thing away from me
[1:42:54] she said oh I'm lost I'm lost I'm
[1:42:57] lost but he said I'm going to put this
[1:42:59] righteousness around you I'm going to
[1:43:01] wrap you from head to
[1:43:04] toe not only that I'm going to put a
[1:43:06] girdle around you and I'm going to gird
[1:43:08] it around you you ready
[1:43:12] bride glory to God I'm righteous as God
[1:43:16] is
[1:43:17] hallelujah it changed the way I feel it
[1:43:21] changed the way I walk it Chang is the
[1:43:23] way I do say how come y'all act that way
[1:43:25] we got a girdle of almighty God around
[1:43:28] us come on somebody but the church don't
[1:43:31] want no girdle of his righteousness and
[1:43:33] his Purity it'll tie you in shape you
[1:43:39] ready well glory to God that's kind of
[1:43:42] cutting off my wind down here but it
[1:43:44] what it'll do it'll kind of help you get
[1:43:45] more air in your diaphragm and this is
[1:43:47] one way you do it well thank you Jesus
[1:43:50] thank you Jesus Hallelujah it'll make
[1:43:53] you act like you never thought You' act
[1:43:56] it'll make you live the way you never
[1:43:58] thought you would because he's got that
[1:44:00] girl around
[1:44:05] [Applause]
[1:44:13] sh with a golden girl around the breast
[1:44:18] part of the church
[1:44:25] you see the
[1:44:26] nourishing comes from the bride's
[1:44:33] body I know this perverted generation
[1:44:37] that we live in when men want to be
[1:44:40] women and women want to be men but I'd
[1:44:43] like for one to be able to get pregnant
[1:44:46] and be able to give birth to a child the
[1:44:48] way a woman
[1:44:50] does I heard a Baptist preacher sat not
[1:44:52] long goes I'll tell you one thing we can
[1:44:54] do he said if we put all these people
[1:44:56] together and to put them all up in one
[1:44:58] place and let them live in one place
[1:45:00] long enough they'll pretty much take
[1:45:02] care of theel because they can't
[1:45:04] reproduce well it's the same way with
[1:45:06] church denomination all it produces is
[1:45:09] another Baptist or it produces another
[1:45:11] Church of God or another Church of
[1:45:13] Christ I'll tell you one thing friend
[1:45:14] it's a shame but if we're not careful
[1:45:16] the message people are going the same
[1:45:17] way we produce another another seven
[1:45:20] Thunder child and another perusia child
[1:45:22] what we need to produce are children
[1:45:24] that are filled with the Holy Ghost that
[1:45:26] are so filled with the power of God that
[1:45:29] they merge into the image of the son of
[1:45:32] man and the Lord God ties that burden
[1:45:35] around them oh if I could only give up
[1:45:37] this if I could only give up that if you
[1:45:39] get full of the Holy Ghost that power of
[1:45:42] God will burn that world out of
[1:45:45] you then the Lord Jesus girdles out
[1:45:49] around you and you say out of my way
[1:45:51] devil
[1:45:53] [Applause]
[1:46:01] watch this in the patmas vision voice of
[1:46:04] many

[1:49:55] voice of Mama the voice of Daddy it's
[1:49:57] the voice of many
[1:50:02] Waters his voice was the sound of many
[1:50:05] Waters watch this the church age book
[1:50:07] Waters what do the waters represent here
[1:50:09] in Revelation again he quotes it
[1:50:11] Revelation 17:15 the People The Voice
[1:50:13] the water rather that thou sawest was
[1:50:15] peoples and multitudes and Nations and
[1:50:19] tongues his voice was the sound of many
[1:50:22] multitudes speaking what is it it's the
[1:50:25] Judgment for these are the voices of the
[1:50:27] multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy
[1:50:31] Spirit All Through the Ages have
[1:50:34] testified not just
[1:50:36] preachers
[1:50:38] testified to Christ and preached his
[1:50:41] gospel it will be the voice of every man
[1:50:44] rising in the Judgment Against The
[1:50:45] Sinner who did not take warning the
[1:50:48] voices of the seven Messengers will be
[1:50:51] heard loud and clear yes sir those
[1:50:55] faithful
[1:50:56] preachers who preach the saving power of
[1:50:59] Jesus preach water baptism in Jesus name
[1:51:02] who preached the infilling and power of
[1:51:04] the Holy Ghost who stood with the word
[1:51:06] more than they stood with their own
[1:51:09] lives all of them were the
[1:51:14] voice of
[1:51:17] Jesus
[1:51:21] Christ but yet we have an element of
[1:51:23] people around this message that say the
[1:51:25] only voice of Jesus Christ is brother
[1:51:29] brandom so you see they don't even
[1:51:31] believe what he said
[1:51:37] himself every God call man that's a
[1:51:41] preacher is that voice let me go a
[1:51:43] little farther every holy ghost fil
[1:51:45] woman every holy ghost fil man is
[1:51:48] expressing that lived voice of Jesus
[1:51:50] Christ
[1:51:52] just be preacher standing that day it
[1:51:54] will be some of you that walked into
[1:51:55] Walmart and walked into Target and
[1:51:57] walked wherever you sisters walk and you
[1:51:59] bore the image of the requirement of
[1:52:01] your bridegroom this requirement is not
[1:52:04] because the brother Brenham had the idea
[1:52:06] it's God's
[1:52:07] requirement and they laughed and made
[1:52:10] fun of you and ridiculed you some of you
[1:52:12] have worked in public places and you've
[1:52:14] suffered reproach because of that word
[1:52:17] that's right one day you'll stand there
[1:52:19] in your voice by your life
[1:52:23] and they will stand and look at you all
[1:52:24] the names they called you all the things
[1:52:26] they said against you and that spirit in
[1:52:29] them of the devil have you the spirit of
[1:52:31] God in you and you will stand there by
[1:52:33] your lived voice and condemn
[1:52:37] them Lord God I don't want to be
[1:52:39] condemned that
[1:52:41] day oh Lord they stood with their own
[1:52:45] lives all of them were the voice of
[1:52:47] Jesus Christ by the Holy
[1:52:49] Ghost wow the prophet didn't say
[1:52:53] they pushed
[1:52:55] play but they
[1:52:58] preached wow well I wonder where that's
[1:53:01] coming from
[1:53:03] them watch this angel of God I am merely
[1:53:06] just a mouthpiece for him and Moses was
[1:53:08] just a mouthpiece for him and Jesus was
[1:53:10] a mouthpiece for God and he died to
[1:53:13] redeem us sinners that the program of
[1:53:17] God might be carried on down through the
[1:53:19] age through the church amen and
[1:53:23] ministers that are consecrated to God
[1:53:27] become channels where
[1:53:31] God can speak through preach the gospel
[1:53:36] heal the sick show
[1:53:39] signs and
[1:53:41] wonders can I have a few more minutes of
[1:53:43] your time notice this and God said in
[1:53:47] the church first what missionaries or
[1:53:49] Apostles Apostle and missionaries I've
[1:53:51] told you T
[1:53:52] the same thing One S Apostles prophets
[1:53:55] teachers evangelists pastors God set it
[1:53:58] in the church for the perfecting of the
[1:54:00] church that's Divine gifts that God
[1:54:03] foreordained to set in the church see
[1:54:05] these are for the perfecting of the
[1:54:07] church
[1:54:18] Jesus now when I push play this is why I
[1:54:22] hear him say Well when I push play this
[1:54:25] is what I hear him say when I push play
[1:54:28] this is what I hear him say when I push
[1:54:30] play this is what I hear him
[1:54:32] [Music]
[1:54:33] say and I'm going to do it one more
[1:54:39] time Jesus speaks through his
[1:54:42] Pastor speaks through his teacher speaks
[1:54:47] through his sear his Prophet speaks
[1:54:51] through his missionary to the countries
[1:54:53] and so forth that's his
[1:54:56] [Music]
[1:54:57] gifts that he's put in the
[1:55:01] church so let me just go ahead and send
[1:55:03] a notification down to Hell go ahead all
[1:55:06] you demons down there and start dialing
[1:55:10] 911 because I'm going to tell you as
[1:55:13] hard as a devil has tried down Through
[1:55:15] the Ages he tried to burn them Holy
[1:55:17] Ghost Field preachers he tried to cut
[1:55:19] their heads off he tried to make it so
[1:55:22] diff difficult and so belligerent that
[1:55:24] nobody would ever want to be a preacher
[1:55:26] and some of their own Sons which watch
[1:55:28] their daddy's heads be cut off felt the
[1:55:31] call of God and they started preaching
[1:55:33] the same thing daddy preached and it's
[1:55:35] the same way down Through the Ages he
[1:55:37] tried to stop the men of God and he has
[1:55:40] failed he tried in the days of Luther
[1:55:43] when Luther stood for the truth and the
[1:55:45] Catholic Church threatened to take his
[1:55:47] life but it didn't make no difference
[1:55:50] why because Jesus said go Luther go and
[1:55:54] Luther said I'm going to go go go and
[1:55:58] Wesley went and Pentecost went and
[1:56:01] Malachi 4 went and I'm going and you're
[1:56:05] going and you're going why because the
[1:56:08] ministry of Jesus Christ must be on the
[1:56:17] earth
[1:56:19] L's we ain't knowwhere near are going to
[1:56:22] get done so we'll just find a place to
[1:56:24] get off and pick it up again Lord will
[1:56:29] it brother Tim prudy posted this quote I
[1:56:33] thought it was so
[1:56:34] outstanding I think of a minister today
[1:56:37] that's called of
[1:56:39] God to step into the
[1:56:44] tracks where
[1:56:46] Jesus
[1:56:49] stupid what a command what a Comm
[1:56:52] Mission but each that's called of God is
[1:56:58] commissioned to stand in that same place
[1:57:01] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:57:04] of the way each Minister's called to
[1:57:07] stand where he would the works that I
[1:57:11] do shall you do
[1:57:14] also each Minister ordained of God is
[1:57:19] commanded to stand in the tracks
[1:57:23] of Jesus
[1:57:25] Christ and perform the
[1:57:28] duties that
[1:57:31] Jesus
[1:57:37] performed
[1:57:38] wow can't you see why true men of God
[1:57:42] wish it wasn't their
[1:57:43] call I ain't trying to be like brother
[1:57:46] Ron Spencer I ain't trying to be like
[1:57:47] brother Tim I'm not giving a call to act
[1:57:51] like those Brothers I'm not giv a call
[1:57:52] Tack like brother Daryl I'm called if
[1:57:55] I'm called of
[1:57:57] God to stand and walk in the same
[1:58:02] footprints that Jesus
[1:58:04] did that's more than Healing The Sick
[1:58:07] it's to love those that hate you it's to
[1:58:10] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:58:12] oh raising the dead healing the S oh
[1:58:13] yeah we we love all that but them tracks
[1:58:16] of Jesus led him to Calvary them tracks
[1:58:19] of Jesus led him to a forgiveness that
[1:58:21] people had never EXP experienced on the
[1:58:22] earth

[2:02:00] know many of you Christians you're
[2:02:01] filled with the Holy Ghost you love him
[2:02:03] with all your
[2:02:04] heart but you want to see yourself a
[2:02:07] little bit more clearly in his
[2:02:09] word friends we keep on trying to
[2:02:11] perfect this old body and we ain't never
[2:02:13] going to do it God ain't wanting you to
[2:02:16] perfect your Humanity he's wanting you
[2:02:18] to control it it's not perfection it's
[2:02:23] subjection subjection is what we should
[2:02:26] be focusing on you'll never get it
[2:02:29] perfect as great as brother bram's
[2:02:31] Ministry was he never perfected his
[2:02:35] Humanity but he subjected his
[2:02:39] Humanity that's what God
[2:02:42] wants oh some of us are so opinionated
[2:02:45] and some of us are so flyy and we're
[2:02:46] this and that we let that dominate who
[2:02:49] we are and our fellowship of our
[2:02:50] brothers and sisters
[2:02:53] let the Lord Jesus just help
[2:02:56] us you see he himself went through that
[2:02:59] the prophet makes an astounding
[2:03:01] statement and mentions it several times
[2:03:02] he said even the Flesh of Jesus could
[2:03:06] not glorify in the presence of
[2:03:09] God don't you understand when he took on
[2:03:11] that human
[2:03:13] flesh it was a condensation for
[2:03:17] him he
[2:03:20] understands how many he wants to be more
[2:03:22] like
[2:03:22] him you want him to guard that around
[2:03:26] you his righteousness his
[2:03:28] Purity and you focus Lord what can I
[2:03:33] do what can I do Lord brother Donnie
[2:03:35] said it over and over again today

[2:04:14] greatest
[2:04:15] titles that could be given to a daughter
[2:04:17] of
[2:04:19] God when she is a mother he calls her
[2:04:22] the Fifth
[2:04:24] Gospel Matthew Mark Luke

[2:04:55] old and herica was asking and talking
[2:05:00] about serpent
[2:05:02] seed and Carol said she marveled as she
[2:05:05] heard her little four-year-old daughter
[2:05:08] talking about serpent seed train a child
[2:05:11] up in the way it should
[2:05:12] go if they can learn all the Disney
