[0:00] let me just tell you this morning
[0:01] friends that will be the foolish virgin
[0:03] that do not assume the mark of the beast
[0:05] that will also be messaged people who've
[0:07] sat around and played
[0:08] church some of you that attend this
[0:10] church if you don't get on fire with god
[0:13] and get the baptism of the holy ghost
[0:15] you're going straight for the
[0:16] tribulation
[0:17] as sure as there's a god in heaven
[0:19] you're not going to go on the rapture
[0:20] just because you say you believe god
[0:23] sent a prophet
[0:24] you're not going in the rapture because
[0:25] you attend happy valley on the occasion
[0:28] you're going to have to go in the
[0:29] rapture because you are filled with the
[0:31] holy ghost and born again
[0:33] that's the only way you're going i don't
[0:35] have a ticket to be able to hand out to
[0:37] each one of you
[0:38] to give you a token in the rapture
[0:40] you're going because you're born
[0:42] of the spirit of god there will be
[0:44] thousands no doubt and message people
[0:46] that will wake up one day
[0:48] and realize they have played church to
[0:50] me they will be the worst
[0:52] category when the morning finally
[0:54] arrives and it dawns on them
[0:56] that they had missed the rapture
[0:58] whenever they look around
[1:00] the pastor's gone and mama's gone and
[1:02] this one's gone and that one's gone
[1:04] and they go to trial and telling the
[1:05] people of the world they're gonna think
[1:06] they're absolutely nuts
[1:08] they're not gonna believe the rapture's
[1:10] taking place because they're preachers
[1:11] still here
[1:12] and the denominational people how long
[1:14] will it take
[1:15] before some of the message people are
[1:17] able to convince these others
[1:19] a week a month six months that the
[1:21] rapture has finally come
[1:23] and they have missed it i don't know
[1:25] because i don't plan on being around
[1:27] i want to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:30] right now
[1:31] let me tell you something this morning
[1:32] friend i'm not waiting for the eclipse
[1:34] that's going to come in august
[1:36] i'm not waiting for the solar pattern to
[1:38] come on september the 21st
[1:40] and strike over jerusalem i'm ready
[1:42] right now
[1:43] this morning not only that but let me go
[1:46] on and say i live
[1:47] ready every day of my life how many
[1:50] years with me
[1:51] you live ready you don't have to wait to
[1:54] come to sunday to get right with god you
[1:56] stay right every day
[1:58] and if you make a mistake and you do
[1:59] something wrong you simply repent of it
[2:02] and ask god to take it out of your life
[2:04] because if you are filled with the holy
[2:06] ghost
[2:07] you know it could be at any moment it
[2:09] could be at any time
[2:11] oh brother donny i'm waiting for this
[2:12] sign and that sign you'll never catch it
[2:15] the bride does not live by such a way
[2:18] the bride lives by love
[2:20] not by looking for signs not by reading
[2:23] a newspaper looking for a new website
[2:26] that prophetically tells you when he's
[2:28] coming nobody knows when he's coming
[2:30] but yet the spirit of god in us will
[2:33] keep us
[2:34] aware and ready and alarmed
[2:39] amen do you believe it the world wants
[2:41] to try to rock us to sleep
[2:43] and get us to where we're complacent and
[2:45] cold and indifferent
[2:46] and light delay of the sins but for
[2:48] myself i refuse to be cold in this hour
[2:52] i refuse to be lukewarm i'm going to be
[2:55] on fire
[2:56] why because i can be i can be
[2:59] i don't need a vote i don't need an
[3:01] approval i don't need none of your
[3:03] approval
[3:04] and you don't need mine if i want to be
[3:06] on fire with god
[3:08] i can be on fire with god if i want to
[3:11] be in love with jesus christ
[3:13] i can be it so i just think i will
[3:16] well glory i said i just said i will
[3:20] [Applause]
[3:28] there again you see that comes from the
[3:30] approach of your mind of what you think
[3:32] you can be
[3:33] or what you want to be if you desire to
[3:35] be lukewarm certainly your desire is
[3:37] your option to be so
[3:38] if you want to be complacent you can be
[3:40] so if you desire
[3:42] if you can desire to be it i desire not
[3:44] to
