[37:51] do for
[37:54] eternity we will be worshiping praising
[37:58] adoring loving serving
[38:01] you I can't wait
[38:04] Jesus but I know one thing for sure I
[38:07] don't want to wait till my glorified
[38:09] feet touch the streets of gold for the
[38:12] first time before I praise you I going
[38:15] to praise you every day of my life
[38:18] yes you saw the hands that were uplifted
[38:22] father signifying needs desires
[38:26] petitions we are on our journey still
[38:28] yet and we have sicknesses and disease
[38:31] and troubles along the way we ask you
[38:34] father that you would just help us in
[38:36] our
[38:37] journey Lord Brother Cal Lawson's
[38:39] brother-in-law you see this desperate
[38:42] need that he has today Father we're
[38:43] asking that you'd be mindful of him we
[38:46] have many in our assembly Lord that have
[38:49] different needs and requests and would
[38:51] you help us
[38:52] today Lord we still are mindful of the
[38:57] flood victims up in Tennessee and
[39:00] Western North Carolina Lord many of them
[39:03] still with no home to go to Lord I've
[39:06] been thinking about them so much since
[39:09] it's got cold and what they're going to
[39:11] do how they're going to
[39:13] survive Lord and I saw a thing the other
[39:15] day where over a 100,000
[39:18] homes had been either destroyed or
[39:20] damaged by all that stuff so we pray
[39:24] that you'd be mindful I know people
[39:26] called it a Act of God but we know it
[39:29] was not our God that did such a thing
[39:32] but we know it's the prince of the power
[39:36] of the air and one day the last
[39:40] hurricane will spin its last time
[39:43] there'll be no more storms Lord Jesus
[39:46] we're waiting for that day help us today
[39:49] as we look into your word we pray father
[39:52] in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints
[39:56] let's turn to u 1 Corinthians chap 11 if
[40:00] you would today greet you today in the
[40:02] name of the Lord Jesus what a privilege
[40:04] it is for us to once again be gathered
[40:07] together in his
[40:09] house I want to speak to you again today
[40:12] by the help of the Lord on the right to
[40:14] be in divine
[40:16] order 1 Corinthians
[40:19] 11:34 If any man hunger let him eat at
[40:23] home that you come not together unto to
[40:27] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[40:32] order when I come so the first church
[40:36] was not only a supernatural Church A
[40:40] Gifted Church in the book of Acts but
[40:43] they were also a church that had
[40:45] problems troubles issues the very reason
[40:49] that deacons were called in the book of
[40:53] Acts was not to hand out gifts deacon
[40:57] were not called to minister so much in
[41:00] the same realm as the preachers were but
[41:04] to be able to help the needs of the
[41:06] people and I I think that each of us are
[41:10] aware of that already but I trust we
[41:11] never lose sight of that that church is
[41:15] not just about signs wonders and
[41:18] miracles while we're here but it's us
[41:20] taking this same gospel and letting
[41:23] people see the love and the life of God
[41:25] liveing us when we're out there every
[41:27] day 1 Corinthians
[41:30] 14:40 let all things be done decently
[41:35] and in order and the word is taxi and
[41:39] arranging Arrangement a fixed succession
[41:42] observing a fixed time doe or right
[41:46] order or orderly condition post rank or
[41:51] position which one holds in Civic or
[41:54] other Affairs and since this position
[41:57] generally depends on one's talents
[42:00] experiences resources character fashion
[42:04] quality and style so there was not only
[42:07] a spiritual aspect of the church but
[42:10] there was also a natural aspect there's
[42:12] an element of Christianity Today that
[42:15] believes that church has no order to it
[42:19] that there's actually no such a thing
[42:21] really as pastors and deacons and
[42:24] trustees and Ministry that people just
[42:27] you know they're in in Christ socalled
[42:29] and they do whatever they want to do you
[42:30] don't have to go to church you don't
[42:32] have to do really anything at all and
[42:34] they think that's the Bible that is
[42:37] Antichrist is what that is if you knew
[42:39] your Bible very well you'd know that the
[42:42] church had elders and pastors and
[42:44] deacons and all those sort of things God
[42:47] is a god of order is he on Colossians
[42:50] chapter 2 verse 5 for though I be absent
[42:54] in the flesh yet am I with you in the
[42:59] spirit joying and beholding your order
[43:04] and the steadfastness of your faith in
[43:08] Christ may the Lord bless his words you
[43:10] may be seated if you don't mind I'd like
[43:12] to um read to you again the um um the
[43:17] couple of paragraphs here of the Prophet
[43:19] seeing the great constellations and the
[43:23] heavens and looking up in the night sky
[43:26] and seeing seeing things that he saw
[43:30] beyond what man could see of course and
[43:34] he said somewhere in time I pointed out
[43:36] to me one time in an observatory the
[43:39] Zodiac showing notice this now beginning
[43:42] with the Virgin coming over through the
[43:45] cancer age on down to the last was the
[43:48] lion Leo the Lion the first coming of
[43:51] Christ by the Virgin the second coming
[43:52] by the line of the tribe of Judah and I
[43:56] said I've tried my best to see that
[43:58] zodiac and I can't see it but yet it's
[44:02] there those who are trained know it's
[44:05] there job saw it man used to look at it
[44:09] it was a Bible at one day but in that
[44:12] great whole great mass of millions and
[44:17] billions of Lighty years and I remember
[44:20] at this time frame they were only seeing
[44:22] 120 million years of light space so how
[44:27] is it that he was talking about billions
[44:30] of years of light years God sits in the
[44:33] midst of his all and he looks down Paul
[44:35] is in there my mother's in there
[44:37] somewhere looking down and I thought of
[44:39] the order of that Heavenly Host not one
[44:43] of them's out of place every one of
[44:45] them's kept time perfectly God's Great
[44:49] Army I mean know that even the way that
[44:53] science has become more advanced today
[44:55] that they're able to look at that
[44:56] pattern and they've already got it
[44:58] charted and the time of when the next uh
[45:02] lunar eclipse will be and when the next
[45:05] eclipse of the sun will be and they
[45:07] already have it out charted for several
[45:09] several years when the next meteor
[45:12] shower will come through we had one just
[45:15] this past week if you saw it and they've
[45:18] known that for many many years now how
[45:20] can they know it because it's all set in
[45:24] a pattern Galileo whenever he was
[45:26] studying many many years ago and those
[45:29] who looked at the stars and they saw
[45:31] that there was a repeat now you know
[45:33] every Star is not in a constellation but
[45:37] some are forming a big pattern out there
[45:39] in the universe and you don't see them
[45:42] at every thousand years or maybe every
[45:44] 2500 years but yet they're still in a
[45:48] flight path so they only become visible
[45:52] every now and then and then there's
[45:53] certain ones that are meteors which are
[45:56] nothing but just spinoff of a planet I
[45:59] hope and pray to God that every person
[46:02] under the sound of my voice today
[46:04] actually belongs in a Divine
[46:07] constellation and you're not just a
[46:10] piece of space junk and you're just
[46:14] flowing around now you realize that
[46:16] because of what man has done through the
[46:18] years by rocket Chambers and by
[46:20] satellites that there's all types of
[46:23] what they call space junk in the
[46:26] universe so when once it gets up in
[46:27] there then it falls into the pattern of
[46:29] where it goes around the paths of the
[46:31] earth some of them in time will start
[46:34] dropping down and then whatever it does
[46:35] it'll burn and expose it comes down
[46:38] through the Earth's universe and God did
[46:39] it that way or the Earth's atmosphere
[46:41] rather so that it would be able to
[46:43] protect the Earth but truly we don't
[46:46] desire to be those types of Christians
[46:48] do we to where we just float here and
[46:51] there we have no goal no purpose no
[46:53] motive in life we're just here today and
[46:56] we're there tomorrow and we're there
[46:58] next week then we're there over there
[47:00] next month but I desire myself I trust
[47:03] you do to have a place in the body of
[47:07] Jesus Christ now I don't desire a great
[47:09] place and never have I don't want a big
[47:12] this and that and the other I just
[47:13] desire a position whatever that is
[47:16] that's fine with me now the prophet saw
[47:19] this and he could see that that zodiac
[47:22] it reflected a story and he called it a
[47:25] pattern I thought of the Soul soers how
[47:27] if that Moon would happen to get out of
[47:29] order the Earth would be covered again
[47:32] with water in just a few minutes now we
[47:36] know in the and deluvian destruction
[47:39] which was in the days of Noah that it
[47:41] wasn't just that all of the sudden that
[47:44] these great massive rainclouds started
[47:47] gathering in the sky and something
[47:49] started happening but it was an event
[47:53] that was identified in the heavens I
[47:56] want you to know notice a prophet that
[47:58] he actually picks it up here that the
[48:00] flood on the Earth was identified was
[48:04] also something that happened in the
[48:07] heavens now what was it that happened in
[48:09] the heavens you see such a catastrophic
[48:12] flood could have never happened as long
[48:15] as the moon would have stayed in her
[48:18] designated order but God had to allow
[48:22] the moon to be moved out of her
[48:25] designated order for a season and when
[48:29] God created the heavens and the Earth
[48:31] and the Earth was without form and void
[48:34] in darkness covered the face of the deep
[48:36] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[48:38] waters and God said let there be light
[48:41] and there was light and God divided the
[48:43] light from the darkness and the light he
[48:46] called day and the Darkness he called
[48:49] night and the evening and the morning
[48:52] were the first day now this is why the
[48:54] Hebrews still to this day
[48:57] they actually called the beginning of a
[48:59] new day the evening of another one so
[49:03] this afternoon Sunday evening the
[49:06] Hebrews will identify the beginning of
[49:08] Monday at the close of Sunday afternoon
[49:12] so the way we are looking at it the
[49:15] seventh evening in the seventh Church
[49:17] age is actually the dawning of a brand
[49:20] new day and the evening and the morning
[49:23] will be the seventh day so God had to
[49:27] have something to happen to the Moon
[49:30] before this great catastrophic flood
[49:33] could come upon the Earth and then the
[49:34] Bible goes on to tell us in the Book of
[49:36] Genesis that The Fountains of the deep
[49:40] broke up so God had allowed a great
[49:43] great mass of water down in the what is
[49:46] called the aquifers which are beneath
[49:49] the Earth surface and they're still
[49:51] there and we're still pulling water from
[49:53] there so God allowed them to break up
[49:56] and when they broke up then Water
[49:59] started oozing out of the bowels of the
[50:02] Earth but of course there was also rain
[50:05] clouds and they started moving and then
[50:07] the Earth was under the influence of the
[50:11] Moon moving back out of her cycle
[50:14] somewhat and turning her back in order
[50:17] for the tidal waves to start coming upon
[50:21] the Earth as well so the Earth is being
[50:24] inundated from the heavens from within
[50:28] itself and also from the power of the
[50:31] Moon which turned its back now keep in
[50:34] mind that we're talking about the Bible
[50:36] being written in the stars so what's
[50:39] going to happen in the last days you see
[50:41] people just look around and say well
[50:43] it's church is normal we've done this
[50:45] for how many ever years it's going on
[50:48] like it always has oh no you see when
[50:51] God takes the bride from the earth the
[50:54] bride's back will be turned upon the
[50:58] Earth the blood will be lifted from the
[51:02] earth The Mercy Seat will be vacated all
[51:06] hell will break
[51:08] loose the chief demon the head demon
[51:12] would have already become incarnate in
[51:15] the pope and he's only waiting for the
[51:18] bride to be gone and when she is lifted
[51:21] then Satan will be cast out of Heaven
[51:24] he'll come down on the earth and then it
[51:26] will begin what he's desired for all of
[51:29] these thousands of years it will all be
[51:32] linked together again now it's God's
[51:35] Great Army is what brother Ram called it
[51:38] and when I thought about that being
[51:40] God's Great Army there now we went to
[51:42] bed and I begin to think that not one of
[51:45] those get out of their place they're all
[51:47] set in place and if there's a moving
[51:50] anywhere of them it's for a cause and
[51:52] will affect the Earth so the Earth is
[51:56] time
[51:57] not only with Mars and Jupiter but also
[52:00] with the sun and with the moon so this
[52:03] event that happened there in Noah's day
[52:07] was a an event that was written in the
[52:09] sky so if we can look and see that by
[52:13] God's grace that the stars are still
[52:16] where they need to be if we could see on
[52:19] the earth that the army of God is
[52:22] finding their place and getting where
[52:25] they need to be not not only in the
[52:27] mystical invisible part but also in the
[52:31] human part the local assembly you see
[52:34] it's not just you and I finding our
[52:37] place in Christ Jesus that's just a
[52:40] copout for a lot of people and they said
[52:42] well I'm in Christ well if you are in
[52:45] Christ you'll get in Christ's local
[52:47] assembly as well amen that's right if
[52:50] you believe all he said now I thought
[52:52] then if that great Heavenly Host like
[52:54] that has to keep its place to make thing
[52:56] in order what about the disorder of the
[53:00] Earthly host how when one gets out of
[53:03] order how it throws the whole thing out
[53:07] of cater the whole program of God is
[53:11] upset when one member gets out of order
[53:16] we should continually to strive to keep
[53:19] the order of the spirit now every one of
[53:23] us then that today are in Christ Jesus
[53:26] and some of you that maybe you're not
[53:29] actually in there yet in the mystical
[53:31] part but you're on your way and me know
[53:33] there's steps to coming into the body of
[53:35] Christ justification sanctification
[53:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost so let's jump
[53:40] now to that last part which is when
[53:43] we're really in the mystical part so
[53:45] after we're sealed in Christ Jesus our
[53:49] soul is a secure as the Lord God himself
[53:53] Satan can no longer touch our soul but
[53:57] our bodies and our Spirits are still
[54:01] subject to the influence of demons and
[54:04] darkness that are around us our bodies
[54:06] subject to sickness our Spirits uh can
[54:09] be down and distraught and all that sort
[54:11] of thing but our soul is sealed in the
[54:15] spirit of God for our lives are HID with
[54:17] God in Christ now watch in 1 Corinthians
[54:20] 12: 13 Paul said for by one Spirit are
[54:24] we all baptized in to one body whether
[54:28] we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be
[54:30] Bond or free and have been all made to
[54:33] drink into one Spirit now what I'm going
[54:35] to describe to you first is the mystical
[54:38] part that's the part that's invisible
[54:41] now in the mystical part today people
[54:44] have already gathered in South Africa
[54:46] New Zealand Australia all over the
[54:49] continent of Africa they've gathered in
[54:51] somia they've gathered in you know the
[54:53] islands in the in the Pacific in Asia
[54:56] they've already gathered because they're
[54:58] ahead of us in the time frame and know
[55:00] we will never see many of those people
[55:03] but we are all in one body in Christ
[55:06] Jesus but yet God did not just want it
[55:09] to be the supernatural mystical part but
[55:12] he wanted to continue his work on Earth
[55:16] the same way he started his work and
[55:19] that was he started a church and the
[55:22] first one was the church at Jerusalem
[55:25] now after the the church becomes
[55:27] established a little bit then James
[55:30] becomes the first pastor of the church
[55:33] now Peter is an apostle so Peter's going
[55:36] out with the Keys of the Kingdom he goes
[55:38] to the Jews he goes to the Gentiles and
[55:40] then Philip goes to the Samaritans and
[55:43] the church body starts growing so
[55:45] they're focusing on two things the
[55:48] mystical part get them in to Christ
[55:51] Jesus then once you get them into Christ
[55:54] Jesus then a St start establishing
[55:58] churches why so they can have a place to
[56:01] go where God can continue his work the
[56:05] apostolic view is going to be the
[56:08] apostles will go out and they'll start
[56:10] new works believe it or not we still
[56:12] have end of the message and that's what
[56:13] their call is they go into communities
[56:16] and God will burden their heart and
[56:18] they'll start a work they may stay there
[56:20] a year or two or three then they feel to
[56:22] leave and they'll go somewhere else that
[56:24] church will get a pastor and it
[56:26] continues to grow and go that's the way
[56:28] God established the church notice 2
[56:31] Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be
[56:35] in Christ now you can be in the local
[56:38] assembly today but yet not be in Christ
[56:41] but if you're in Christ then there
[56:44] should be something in you that you want
[56:46] to come together with the rest of your
[56:48] brothers and sisters and fellowship and
[56:51] worship and be around those that are of
[56:54] like Precious face and the church says
[56:56] amen therefore If any man be in Christ
[56:59] Jesus he is a new creature old things
[57:02] are passed away behold all things are
[57:05] new Galatians 3:27 for as many of of you
[57:10] that have been baptized into Christ into
[57:15] Christ now remember I baptize you in
[57:17] water or some of these others baptized
[57:20] brother brothers in water and that's
[57:22] only to baptize you into the fellowship
[57:24] and you're taking on the name name of
[57:26] the Lord Jesus but no preacher can
[57:29] baptize you into Christ Jesus only he
[57:31] himself but as many of you have been
[57:34] baptized into Christ have put on Christ
[57:38] now remember the mystical part again put
[57:41] on look at the word put in Duo and
[57:44] clothed with clothed in to sink into
[57:48] closing so then a person that is
[57:51] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the
[57:53] mystical body what they've done they
[57:56] have sunk into new clothes so their soul
[58:01] sunk into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:05] so in their soul every one of us here
[58:08] today that that have got the Holy Ghost
[58:10] our soul has sunk in to new clothes
[58:14] which is Christ Jesus in the mystical
[58:17] Body of Christ there's never been one
[58:19] argument there's never been one
[58:21] disagreement in the mystical Body of
[58:24] Christ no preachers debate with each
[58:27] other in the mystical Body of Christ no
[58:30] preachers argue no deacons argue no
[58:32] people argue Mom and Daddy don't argue
[58:34] nobody argues in the mystical Body of
[58:37] Christ is that right why it's not
[58:39] allowed that's it's not allowed but in
[58:42] the local assembly there's difference of
[58:44] opinion and there's argument aren't you
[58:47] glad one day we're not just going to be
[58:48] made new but all them Oddities that
[58:51] every one of us have are all going to be
[58:54] changed as well and that's what causes
[58:57] us our problems and that's the very
[58:59] reason that Satan wants to do that is in
[59:02] order to say well you know ever church
[59:04] I've been to I've got hurt and let me
[59:06] give you a heads up if you if you go to
[59:08] 500 more you're going to be hurting all
[59:10] 500 of them because you got human beings
[59:13] there and we're going to hurt one
[59:15] another but it's the same way at Walmart
[59:17] it's the same way at the gas station
[59:19] it's the same way everywhere you go just
[59:21] grow up and put your big boy britches on
[59:23] and know that's the way it is and God is
[59:26] not offering us you know this Cocoon of
[59:29] his Divine love and mercy and
[59:31] everybody's going to walk around our
[59:32] feelings forget it it ain't going to
[59:34] happen that way well praise the Lord now
[59:38] watch this again in Ephesians 1:3
[59:40] blessed be the God and father of our
[59:42] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[59:46] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[59:48] places in Christ notice again this is
[59:51] the mystical part in Christ according as
[59:54] he has chosen Us in him him before the
[59:57] foundation of the world that we should
[59:58] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:00:02] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:00:06] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:00:08] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:00:11] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:00:14] of his grace where he has made us
[1:00:16] accepted in the Beloved I love these two
[1:00:20] words that the prophet put together and
[1:00:22] he called it the mystical body now I won
[1:00:25] the first one of course to use them
[1:00:26] theologians have used them for many many
[1:00:28] hundreds of years but he really put an
[1:00:30] emphasis on it and he said the real
[1:00:33] church is the mystical body of Jesus
[1:00:36] Christ now you cannot organize the
[1:00:39] mystical Body of Christ now every person
[1:00:42] that comes to Christ comes out of the
[1:00:44] world comes into Christ comes into his
[1:00:48] mystical body and you're a member of
[1:00:51] that body when you're brought into this
[1:00:53] church called out and are baptized into
[1:00:56] this mystical body notice what he said
[1:00:59] you get it how many gets it you
[1:01:01] understand so that's the part that we're
[1:01:04] want to point you to it's much easier to
[1:01:07] be a part of Word of Life Church just by
[1:01:10] coming and say well I want to come to
[1:01:11] church here well you're welcome to come
[1:01:13] here if that's what you feel you want to
[1:01:15] do but we don't want you to stop there
[1:01:17] we don't want you to just come and say
[1:01:19] well I come once a week or twice a week
[1:01:21] and I support the church and you know I
[1:01:23] believe they're good people and all that
[1:01:25] that's not not what our goal is our goal
[1:01:27] is to get you into the mystical Body of
[1:01:31] Christ and then you find where God put
[1:01:34] you in your constellation and then there
[1:01:37] and look I've said it before anybody
[1:01:39] that's moved here knows that if they'
[1:01:41] talked to me before they moved here I
[1:01:43] tell people the exact same thing and
[1:01:46] I've done it for decades I want you he
[1:01:48] if God wants you here if he doesn't I
[1:01:51] don't because you will not be happy you
[1:01:54] will be unhappy you'll not be satisfied
[1:01:56] and you'll be complaining about this and
[1:01:59] griping about that but you need to pray
[1:02:01] about where you need to go to church and
[1:02:03] if this is where God wants you then we
[1:02:05] welcome you with all of your flaws and
[1:02:08] all of your issues cuz there ain't
[1:02:10] nobody here today that don't have them
[1:02:13] including the man preaching to you is
[1:02:15] that right but yet God know that this
[1:02:19] would be part of the problem when he had
[1:02:22] a body now humanly wouldn't it just be
[1:02:24] easier in one sense of the word that
[1:02:26] everybody is baptized into the mystical
[1:02:28] body and then you just go your own way
[1:02:31] you create your own Planet you create
[1:02:34] your own world and you just live there
[1:02:36] away from everybody else nobody's mad
[1:02:39] nobody's upset nobody has any problems
[1:02:42] and how's the gospel going to grow from
[1:02:45] planet to planet is you're creating one
[1:02:47] and then you know God knew exactly what
[1:02:50] he was doing but he knew it would be
[1:02:52] issues among them same with Ministry God
[1:02:55] knew knew that preaching would be one of
[1:02:58] the greatest tools that Satan would use
[1:03:01] to Dam people to Hell well come on God
[1:03:05] knew that preaching would be one of the
[1:03:07] most damnable things that would be
[1:03:10] associated with the gospel of Christ but
[1:03:13] he also knew by if you don't hear you
[1:03:16] can't hear without a preacher and how
[1:03:19] can he preached lest he be sent so the
[1:03:22] way God looked at it he deemed it
[1:03:24] absolutely necessary and essential
[1:03:28] though Satan would use it the same way
[1:03:30] with church well people say well I've
[1:03:32] been to so many churches and I'm looking
[1:03:34] and I'm searching for a church and I I
[1:03:36] I'm looking for one you know that
[1:03:38] whatever they think a church is going to
[1:03:40] be and they've been here and they've
[1:03:41] been there and they've been somewhere
[1:03:43] else why there's something in people and
[1:03:45] they're looking and searching and we
[1:03:47] didn't realize it we are not called to
[1:03:49] be everybody's
[1:03:51] church is that right but now notice how
[1:03:54] the prophet is and goes on in this same
[1:03:56] message five identifications of the
[1:03:58] Church of the Living God if you haven't
[1:03:59] listened to this while it do you good to
[1:04:00] listen to it when a man or woman is
[1:04:02] called into the mystical Body of Christ
[1:04:04] by the Holy Spirit they become a full
[1:04:07] member of his body when they're filled
[1:04:09] with the Holy Ghost because God took the
[1:04:11] spirit out of Christ raised up his body
[1:04:14] placed it at his throne and sent back
[1:04:17] the Holy Spirit to make up the mystical
[1:04:19] Body of Christ which will be United at
[1:04:22] the marriage supper at the coming of the
[1:04:25] Lord you can't organize it it is a
[1:04:28] mystery you can't organize it it is a
[1:04:32] mystery now what the devil wanted man to
[1:04:35] do is replace this mystical part and by
[1:04:39] preachers Through the Ages just convince
[1:04:42] people all they have to do is accept him
[1:04:45] as Savior now they accept him as Savior
[1:04:48] he does away with their sins and then
[1:04:50] they belong to the church they put their
[1:04:52] name on the church book and then of
[1:04:54] course they're going in the Rapture when
[1:04:55] they die they're all going to heaven but
[1:04:57] Satan knew that if he could use the mask
[1:05:01] of the local assembly and have them not
[1:05:04] to point toward 1 Corinthians 12 by one
[1:05:08] Spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:05:10] so then he uses again this tool called
[1:05:12] Ministry and then they convince
[1:05:15] everybody when you accept Christ as
[1:05:17] Savior you received his Spirit Well I
[1:05:20] agree you do receive a portion of his
[1:05:22] Spirit but you're not filled with the
[1:05:24] Holy Ghost yet right is that right
[1:05:26] that's exactly right so he does not lead
[1:05:29] them on then of course to the mystical
[1:05:31] part I hate to say it this morning but I
[1:05:33] got to there's people around the message
[1:05:35] it's exact same way they they left their
[1:05:38] Baptist Church or denominational church
[1:05:41] we give them a bunch of books and a
[1:05:42] bunch of tapes and they change their
[1:05:44] Doctrine they start believing serpent
[1:05:46] seed they start believing this and that
[1:05:47] and the other that's why we've got so
[1:05:49] much confusion and Division in our own
[1:05:51] move why they've never been in in Christ
[1:05:54] Jesus yet okay amen now watch this in
[1:05:57] the saman church age but the body of
[1:06:00] Jesus Christ is not an organization the
[1:06:03] body of Jesus Christ is a mystical body
[1:06:07] it's a body and a kingdom that's a
[1:06:09] spiritual Kingdom that set upon the
[1:06:12] Earth by Jesus Christ being the king of
[1:06:16] this Kingdom the high priest notice to
[1:06:19] offer sacrifices for the wayfaring in
[1:06:24] this Kingdom he's the prophet the word
[1:06:27] that preaches the truth and brings the
[1:06:30] light of God in his kingdom he's both
[1:06:32] Prophet priest and King in his kingdom
[1:06:36] and how do we get in this Kingdom by the
[1:06:39] denomination by letter by hand shaking
[1:06:42] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[1:06:45] this one body which is the mystical body
[1:06:48] of Jesus Christ oh how many is in it
[1:06:51] today aren't you grateful so then it's a
[1:06:53] mystical Kingdom the bottom part of this
[1:06:56] quote it's a mystical kingdom of God
[1:06:58] that's set up then we come into it by
[1:07:01] the Holy Spirit baptism now you see this
[1:07:03] is where so many of the message folks
[1:07:05] that don't believe in going to church is
[1:07:08] where they're missing the last half of
[1:07:10] the Kingdom age because what they
[1:07:13] emphasize oh we're in Christ we're in
[1:07:15] Christ we're in the message so we just
[1:07:17] stay home we don't need to go to church
[1:07:19] but they're missing what he's doing
[1:07:21] right now is setting up a natural
[1:07:24] Kingdom on the Earth which is
[1:07:27] forerunning the Millennium you say what
[1:07:29] are you talking about Brother Don what
[1:07:31] we're here today we are part of the
[1:07:33] forerunning of the Millennium we've
[1:07:36] gathered in the house of God you mean we
[1:07:38] are here today yes we are here to let
[1:07:41] hands on the sick we're here to preach
[1:07:43] the gospel we're here to cast out Devils
[1:07:45] praise the Lord what is this this is a
[1:07:49] reflection of the coming Kingdom in the
[1:07:52] Millennium and he doesn't just want the
[1:07:55] iCal part he wants it to be a city set
[1:07:58] on a hill that the world can be able to
[1:08:01] know that there is a resurrected Savior
[1:08:05] and that's what breaks your heart it's
[1:08:06] so sad that Satan has been able to
[1:08:09] accomplish that in our own ranks and
[1:08:11] convince so many people that there's
[1:08:14] absolutely no need of gathering together
[1:08:16] so the only kingdom of God they project
[1:08:19] is the mystical aspect and yet that's so
[1:08:22] contrary to the original founding of the
[1:08:24] original Church
[1:08:26] now he says in Blasphemous names the
[1:08:28] church is the mystical Body of Christ
[1:08:31] born of the Breath of God did you get it
[1:08:34] the Church of God is born of the breast
[1:08:37] of God God breath god notice this God
[1:08:41] breathed breaths in the nostrils
[1:08:44] spiritually of Adam and he became a
[1:08:46] living Soul you understand that's what
[1:08:48] happened to you when you receive the
[1:08:50] Holy Ghost the same Lord God that
[1:08:52] breathed into Adam breathes the breath
[1:08:55] of of eternal life into your soul that
[1:08:58] old nature laying there that seed of God
[1:09:00] laying there dormant maybe for decades
[1:09:03] and at the time of your birth the Breath
[1:09:06] of God breathed into your soul and your
[1:09:10] soul for the first time caught the
[1:09:13] breaths of life like a baby does when it
[1:09:15] comes out of its mother and your soul
[1:09:18] maybe one in the sense of like that
[1:09:21] because God breathes a breath of life
[1:09:23] into your soul and you become a new
[1:09:27] creature in Christ
[1:09:29] Jesus Oh My did you know the
[1:09:31] Pentecostals of the true Pentecostal
[1:09:34] church is born of the Breath of God hey
[1:09:37] friends how many real true Pentecostals
[1:09:39] today I ain't talking about organization
[1:09:42] now now watch and so we're in the
[1:09:44] spiritual aspect the mystical part and
[1:09:47] we could go on that for a long time but
[1:09:49] list let's change for just a bit so in
[1:09:51] that we're baptized there by the Holy
[1:09:53] Ghost and then the spirit of God
[1:09:55] positionally places us not only in
[1:09:59] Christ Jesus in the mystical part but he
[1:10:02] also gives us a position in his body on
[1:10:06] the earth now if Satan realizes he can
[1:10:10] no longer pull your soul out from under
[1:10:13] the shadow of the wings of the almighty
[1:10:15] then he will changed his tactics and his
[1:10:18] Focus as he did in the original church
[1:10:21] he he wasn't aware of what the Lord
[1:10:23] Jesus was doing in the first months and
[1:10:25] years even when a church is birthed on
[1:10:27] the earth because the Lord Jesus is the
[1:10:29] first one in the New Testament to use
[1:10:31] that word Church Upon This Rock I will
[1:10:33] build my church imagine what the devil
[1:10:35] thought whenever the Lord Jesus used
[1:10:37] this word the first time nobody else use
[1:10:40] it so he had to wait to try to figure
[1:10:42] out so what is a church I don't
[1:10:44] understand what is a church I I don't
[1:10:46] understand what a church is I don't know
[1:10:47] what it is so he had to watch and see
[1:10:50] what happened so he watched on the day
[1:10:52] of Pentecost and still The View was not
[1:10:55] quite plain yet he saw that they
[1:10:57] received something and they were
[1:10:58] different and then they started Healing
[1:11:00] The Sick and then they started growing
[1:11:02] growing so they were going through the
[1:11:03] birst Spains but he still didn't know
[1:11:05] what a church was and then mainly it was
[1:11:08] all Jews and then the spirit of God
[1:11:10] started reaching beyond the Jews and
[1:11:12] calling to the Gentiles and Satan and
[1:11:14] his demons are still watching they're
[1:11:17] learning they're trying to figure it out
[1:11:18] so what's this word church what's he
[1:11:21] mean he's going to start a church
[1:11:23] remember the Old Testament was totally
[1:11:24] different from that so how are they
[1:11:26] going to do what are they going to have
[1:11:28] a type and a shadow well God mirrored
[1:11:30] that actually in Jerusalem whenever he
[1:11:32] chose Jerusalem is a place for his name
[1:11:34] so God showed that there was a special
[1:11:36] place of worship so if you live down on
[1:11:39] the southern part of Israel and you live
[1:11:41] down next to the Dead Sea and yet you
[1:11:44] needed to make an atonement for your sin
[1:11:46] guess what you'd have to do in the day
[1:11:47] of yam Kapur you would have to go go all
[1:11:50] the way either by Ox cart by foot or if
[1:11:52] he was a rich man by a donkey you would
[1:11:54] have to go all the way from the right
[1:11:56] down at the bottom of the Dead Sea and
[1:11:58] go all the way up to Jerusalem many many
[1:12:01] miles away you couldn't just go there to
[1:12:04] the Dead Sea you couldn't if you was in
[1:12:05] the northern part and you live near the
[1:12:07] Mount Hermon you could not just offer
[1:12:09] your lamb there there was only one place
[1:12:12] God would receive a lamb and that was
[1:12:14] the place he chose to put his name which
[1:12:17] was Jerusalem so God was mirroring a
[1:12:20] time that there would be a place on the
[1:12:23] earth that he would receive the worship
[1:12:26] so on the day of yam Kapur Here Comes
[1:12:28] people from the north Here Comes people
[1:12:30] from the west from the east from the
[1:12:31] south what are they all coming for
[1:12:33] there's only one place God will receive
[1:12:35] their sacrifice and that's in Jerusalem
[1:12:37] so there was a mirror but it was so
[1:12:40] vague in the Old Testament they couldn't
[1:12:42] make it out now you imagine if Satan
[1:12:45] started watching this and then the
[1:12:47] church started growing and then they
[1:12:49] started trying to figure out so what are
[1:12:51] we supposed to do and then they started
[1:12:53] having meetings together remember in the
[1:12:55] Old Testament they didn't do that they
[1:12:57] would just go to bring their atonement
[1:12:59] and they would go up to the synagogue
[1:13:00] and they'd discuss the Torah and they
[1:13:02] would talk about it but they never
[1:13:04] actually gathered together like that so
[1:13:06] they started Gathering and then first
[1:13:08] thing you know Paul said when you come
[1:13:10] together start singing spiritual songs
[1:13:13] and hymns so they thought wow well
[1:13:15] that's what David and and the and the
[1:13:17] Levites did in the Old Testament and
[1:13:19] what what about ASAP remember ASA was
[1:13:21] one of the chief musicians of the Old
[1:13:23] Testament and he actually wrote many of
[1:13:24] the Psalms and there was several of the
[1:13:26] Psalms that was dedicated to him but it
[1:13:29] wasn't quite put together like in a
[1:13:31] church surface even in the dedication of
[1:13:33] the Solomon's Temple they all gathered
[1:13:35] together and they was there for several
[1:13:37] days and they prayed and they worshiped
[1:13:39] and they sung but they didn't know what
[1:13:40] else to do church was totally new so
[1:13:43] then Paul said when y all come together
[1:13:45] they said some's got a Psalm some's got
[1:13:48] a song some's got a hymn so you imagine
[1:13:51] that they started coming together and
[1:13:52] say well maybe we can sing one come
[1:13:55] together and maybe we can just start
[1:13:57] kind of worshiping the Lord as we come
[1:14:00] together and then you know the the
[1:14:02] recorded parts of history that go back
[1:14:04] say that they would come together and
[1:14:06] then the leader which of course we call
[1:14:07] the pastor today he would get up in the
[1:14:10] discourse they would start preaching and
[1:14:11] start talking and then the people maybe
[1:14:14] would sit there real quiet because they
[1:14:15] didn't know what you're supposed to do
[1:14:17] in church and then eventually some of
[1:14:19] them started saying
[1:14:23] amen I think some of y'all don't know
[1:14:25] what we're supposed to do in church I I
[1:14:28] guess some of y'all still learning right
[1:14:30] after 60 years you're still learning
[1:14:33] well what are we supposed to do we go to
[1:14:34] church amens are are part of it praise
[1:14:37] the Lord even seek them helps every now
[1:14:40] and then get him get him
[1:14:42] Fritz but it was so new I know this is
[1:14:46] striking you odd right isn't not
[1:14:47] somebody you never even thought of this
[1:14:48] before in your life but yet this is what
[1:14:50] was going on now then Satan once he said
[1:14:53] oh I I see I see
[1:14:55] so is there only going to be one of
[1:14:57] these well were there just since it's in
[1:14:59] Jerusalem and this was God's chosen
[1:15:02] place for his name so will everybody
[1:15:04] then have to come down here to be in
[1:15:06] church well even the disciples
[1:15:09] themselves are playing it by ears we say
[1:15:11] because they didn't know exactly which
[1:15:12] way to go and the spirit of God had
[1:15:14] started growing them and there would be
[1:15:17] a family over here then another family
[1:15:19] and then Paul would go up this direction
[1:15:20] that direction and the next thing you
[1:15:22] know the light was exploding and then
[1:15:25] they would come and they begin to tour
[1:15:27] islands like creit and 100 small cities
[1:15:30] or something like that from the northern
[1:15:31] part and then Paul had to be called off
[1:15:34] to another mission field and then he
[1:15:35] tells Titus he said I left thee there in
[1:15:39] Titus that thou might set us in things
[1:15:41] they ordered that which is lacking now
[1:15:43] those all types of people got converted
[1:15:45] but they still didn't have no churches
[1:15:47] form yet well why didn't they just leave
[1:15:49] them in the mystical part because they
[1:15:52] knew growth would come about
[1:15:55] stability of having a church where
[1:15:58] people can come and the prophet used it
[1:16:00] either way flip it back and forth and he
[1:16:02] called it a home church and also a
[1:16:05] church home so a place to where they
[1:16:08] could come and be refreshed and they
[1:16:11] could fellowship and they can meet well
[1:16:13] by the time it starts now for a few
[1:16:15] years and me Luke's wri in the book of
[1:16:17] of Acts then he look back and they see
[1:16:19] how the church has been given birth and
[1:16:22] then ministers start coming in and then
[1:16:24] as a said earlier they started realizing
[1:16:26] there was natural needs in the body and
[1:16:29] the the disciples said it's not right
[1:16:31] that we should leave the word of God and
[1:16:33] that we should take care of tables
[1:16:36] because the widows and some of the
[1:16:37] orphans are not being taken care of so
[1:16:40] what did they do they come up with
[1:16:41] deacons and then they start coming up
[1:16:44] with the scripture requirement of a
[1:16:46] Deacon's office and then they were to
[1:16:49] help with the body you don't need
[1:16:51] deacons in the mystical body
[1:16:55] deacons don't weigh tables in the
[1:16:57] mystical body you understand what are
[1:17:00] the office of the deacons for brother
[1:17:03] doubt it's for the local
[1:17:05] assembly so look what God is doing he's
[1:17:08] running the two parallel you understand
[1:17:10] what it'll be the kingdom of God
[1:17:12] children it will never come in the
[1:17:15] Millennium until the kingdom of God
[1:17:18] becomes so established in our hearts not
[1:17:22] the heart of the Lord in our hearts and
[1:17:25] we come to our place and our position in
[1:17:29] Christ Jesus that we are Millennium
[1:17:32] ready do you understand it's not him
[1:17:36] it's not him is not the reason that he's
[1:17:39] delayed is coming it's us it's prophecy
[1:17:42] it's things in the earth out here and
[1:17:45] it's us coming to our spot then if it is
[1:17:49] that important and Satan then begin to
[1:17:51] realize oh my this is absolutely
[1:17:54] tremendous tremendous so now demons and
[1:17:57] they'd have their big meetings down in
[1:17:58] hell and they'd have to re subdivide
[1:18:01] them and begin to allocate them
[1:18:02] differently now you know because they
[1:18:04] realize you know what this stuff of
[1:18:06] idolatry and falling down before Asos
[1:18:09] and baale and all that stuff that ain't
[1:18:11] going to work no more we're going to
[1:18:12] have to totally change our tactics we
[1:18:14] got to watch them you imagine certain
[1:18:16] demons that was assigned to hang around
[1:18:18] Paul and you're what Paul preached and
[1:18:20] then certain demons that was assigned to
[1:18:22] hang around Timothy and Titus and fimon
[1:18:25] and some of the other brothers and they
[1:18:27] would see the strengths of these
[1:18:28] Ministries and they would see the
[1:18:30] weaknesses and then they'd try to go in
[1:18:32] and cause a division and they were able
[1:18:34] to do it some said I'm of Paul some said
[1:18:37] I'm of sephus others said I I'm not
[1:18:39] either one I'm of Christ I don't even
[1:18:41] believe in going to
[1:18:42] church so what did Satan do then he
[1:18:45] started reassigning the demons and the
[1:18:47] demons started having to learn how to
[1:18:50] play church let me tell you something
[1:18:52] you and I are battling demons
[1:18:55] that have been doing this now for over
[1:18:57] 2,000
[1:18:59] years you better believe they know what
[1:19:02] they're doing they know oh my they know
[1:19:05] exactly how church runs they know
[1:19:08] exactly what to do with division and all
[1:19:11] that sort of thing to divide among us
[1:19:14] because they have had a lot of practice
[1:19:17] at it but I want to tell every one of
[1:19:20] them here today y'all are older than us
[1:19:23] you demons have had a a whole lot more
[1:19:25] time to do this than we have I'm only 68
[1:19:29] and some of these people in their teens
[1:19:31] some in their 20s and you've been
[1:19:32] disturbing churches for thousands of
[1:19:35] years but let me just tell you today the
[1:19:37] hell Squad there is a millennium squad
[1:19:41] on the earth and not because we are
[1:19:44] greater but greater is he that is in us
[1:19:47] than he that is in the world greater is
[1:19:51] our peace than the peace disturber
[1:19:54] greater is our joy than the joy
[1:19:57] disturber greater is our unity in Christ
[1:20:01] Jesus than all the divisions that the
[1:20:04] devil can ever
[1:20:06] start now what Satan wants to do then if
[1:20:09] he cannot get the soul is to start
[1:20:12] working on the individuals that make up
[1:20:15] that body and that move and this is the
[1:20:18] way he's going to try to do
[1:20:21] it you see God has a design did perfect
[1:20:27] will for each of Our Lives
[1:20:32] yes but Satan also knows there's
[1:20:35] something called the permissive
[1:20:40] will now that's the tricky
[1:20:43] part where actually God will
[1:20:48] allow certain things
[1:20:54] and he'll bless
[1:20:58] it but it's not what he wants for
[1:21:02] you now
[1:21:05] listen you see Satan found this out many
[1:21:09] years
[1:21:10] ago with Abraham and
[1:21:13] Sarah was Adam and
[1:21:15] Eve with
[1:21:17] balum so this principle he carries over
[1:21:21] into the New
[1:21:23] Testament so if he can't stop you from
[1:21:26] loving God oh I'm I'm I'm consecrated to
[1:21:28] the Lord I'm going to serve him I'm
[1:21:30] going to live for him the rest of my
[1:21:32] life praise God then he'll say all right
[1:21:35] guys switch over to permissive
[1:21:40] will so then they start
[1:21:44] recalculating and looking at your
[1:21:47] life and trying to attack you not in the
[1:21:50] mystical part they give up on that
[1:21:53] already but in the local assembly where
[1:21:55] you go to church the family you're part
[1:21:58] of the move that you're part of the
[1:22:01] message of the
[1:22:02] hour and try to get you out of the
[1:22:06] perfect will of
[1:22:08] God for your life now watch this and
[1:22:12] does God ever change his mind about his
[1:22:13] word god permitted Israel to take a law
[1:22:16] in Exodus the 19th Chapter when Grace
[1:22:19] had already given them a prophet Pillar
[1:22:23] of Fire sacrif AC sacrific lamb a
[1:22:26] delivering power but they cried out for
[1:22:30] La it wasn't God's
[1:22:35] will so it was not the will of God to
[1:22:39] have a
[1:22:41] Torah on God told Israel I will make you
[1:22:46] a kingdom of
[1:22:47] priests but they didn't want
[1:22:50] that they wanted a law that would tell
[1:22:53] them what to do what they could do what
[1:22:56] they could not do and God said all right
[1:22:58] if that's what you want that's not my
[1:23:00] choice for you it's not even my will but
[1:23:05] if that's what you want I'll give it to
[1:23:08] you and I'll go ahead and bless you in
[1:23:11] it I tell you friends this is when it
[1:23:14] becomes so difficult right
[1:23:16] here because people can move directly
[1:23:20] out of the perfect will of God for their
[1:23:23] lives and and the way they will measure
[1:23:26] it is by he's blessing
[1:23:30] me we get results don't
[1:23:35] we now listen he says it's best to have
[1:23:39] God's will that's what he's taught us
[1:23:42] thy will be done thy kingdom come thy
[1:23:44] will be done we must submit ourselves to
[1:23:46] his will and his word don't question it
[1:23:49] believe it don't try to find a way
[1:23:53] around it just take it to way way it is
[1:23:55] so many wants to go around get some
[1:23:58] other way and when you do you find
[1:24:01] yourself going on and you find God
[1:24:06] blessing
[1:24:07] you well you know what if you want to
[1:24:09] belong to a church and you want to
[1:24:11] attend a church They Don't Preach
[1:24:13] Holiness They Don't Preach the Full
[1:24:15] Gospel They Don't Preach the opening of
[1:24:17] the word They Don't Preach none of that
[1:24:19] at all and you want to go there and you
[1:24:22] realize there's more and you say well I
[1:24:24] want to go that I'm going see if God
[1:24:25] will bless me more than likely he will
[1:24:28] yeah cuz he's giving you what you
[1:24:31] want over the top of his
[1:24:34] word come
[1:24:36] on
[1:24:38] preaching I figured this would be quiet
[1:24:40] but I didn't think it'd be this
[1:24:42] quiet now what he says you find yourself
[1:24:45] going on and you find God blessing you
[1:24:48] but you're working in his permissive
[1:24:51] will and not in his perfect divine will
[1:24:55] he permits it as I said but he will not
[1:24:58] it will not be his perfect will but
[1:24:59] he'll make it work to honor and bless
[1:25:03] his perfect will he has a permissive
[1:25:07] will now there's where the trouble
[1:25:11] lays we try to work on God's permissive
[1:25:14] will and he will permit it now you see
[1:25:17] here that Sarah after God told Abraham
[1:25:20] that the child would be born through
[1:25:22] Sarah that would bless the word World
[1:25:24] Sarah doubted it and I want you to
[1:25:27] notice it never come by Abraham but by
[1:25:30] Sarah the female she doubted it and she
[1:25:35] said take
[1:25:37] Hagar so God sets forth his original
[1:25:40] word and say this is my plan right here
[1:25:43] I want you all to do that it's just
[1:25:46] something in man's nature that he wants
[1:25:48] to go around it this way and say I'd
[1:25:50] rather go this way if you don't mind I
[1:25:53] really don't see no need in doing all
[1:25:55] that myself I really don't see the need
[1:25:57] in doing it and God says
[1:26:01] okay if that's what you
[1:26:03] want I want you to go this way I want
[1:26:06] you to go around that speaker and you
[1:26:07] say you want to go this way okay go
[1:26:10] ahead so y'all come over here and you
[1:26:12] just gather over here and boy we're
[1:26:14] going to do this I'm telling you why Oh
[1:26:16] Glory to God hallelujah I feel the Lord
[1:26:18] glory to
[1:26:21] Gody boy didn't the Lord bless us
[1:26:24] mhm yep he sure
[1:26:28] does scary
[1:26:31] huh but you see people get in their mind
[1:26:34] that as soon as they live leave the will
[1:26:36] of God that catastrophe and Chaos
[1:26:39] strikes them
[1:26:40] immediately not
[1:26:44] so sometimes it's
[1:26:47] years I've seen men make decisions and
[1:26:53] choices and and it might be 5 years 10
[1:26:57] years my mind right now thinking of
[1:27:00] someone several years ago who sat and
[1:27:03] talked to me in my
[1:27:05] office about some certain things that
[1:27:07] they was going to
[1:27:09] do they didn't come to ask me for any
[1:27:11] advice or any counsel they basically
[1:27:13] just tell me what they was going to
[1:27:15] do I watched within a little short span
[1:27:19] of
[1:27:20] Time how that family started falling
[1:27:23] apart
[1:27:25] how it went from worse to worse to worse
[1:27:30] totally
[1:27:31] divided the fames to this day so busted
[1:27:34] apart why because the father made the
[1:27:39] wrong
[1:27:42] choice a decision that affected his
[1:27:46] children his
[1:27:50] wife oh
[1:27:52] my Mary mer Christmas
[1:27:55] everybody I couldn't give you nothing
[1:27:57] better for Christmas than to try to warn
[1:27:59] you to stay in the will of
[1:28:06] God now watch so Sarah says well you
[1:28:09] know
[1:28:11] what I see that God keeps saying this
[1:28:14] about
[1:28:15] Abraham but maybe it's not coming
[1:28:18] through
[1:28:20] me so they go to Egypt Abraham backsides
[1:28:23] goes to Egypt see a beautiful handmaiden
[1:28:26] there she picks her up and Sarah gets a
[1:28:32] revolution it wasn't a revelation from
[1:28:36] God that's the way God will do it I'll
[1:28:40] merge
[1:28:42] Pentecost in with
[1:28:44] me and that's the way we'll give birth
[1:28:47] to the supernatural
[1:28:50] move listen Sarah if God said you're
[1:28:53] going to bring it you don't need to
[1:28:55] merge it in with Benny
[1:28:59] hen we don't need the 700 Club come on
[1:29:03] somebody we want the perfect will of God
[1:29:07] Amen oh my so God allowed them to go
[1:29:13] that way was it his will
[1:29:16] never
[1:29:18] never and they are still dealing with
[1:29:22] that to this very day that
[1:29:25] choice that they made you understand
[1:29:27] fathers and mothers choices and things
[1:29:30] that you do can affect not only your
[1:29:33] children but your grandchildren and your
[1:29:35] great grandchildren I've seen it time
[1:29:37] and time again that people will get hurt
[1:29:40] by this certain certain family and
[1:29:42] instead of trying to move beyond that
[1:29:44] thing they'll hold that in their hearts
[1:29:47] and they'll pass it to their children
[1:29:49] and their children and their children do
[1:29:51] you understand you're going to stand
[1:29:52] before God for generations of hatred and
[1:29:55] variance instead of letting that stop
[1:29:58] with
[1:30:01] you look friends if anybody's got a
[1:30:04] right to have a grievance against all of
[1:30:06] us it would be the Lord Jesus there
[1:30:10] ain't none of us that's served him with
[1:30:11] all of our hearts come on there ain't
[1:30:14] none of us that's been totally free from
[1:30:17] everything around us and yet what does
[1:30:19] he do to us forgives
[1:30:21] us oh my
[1:30:25] so what would he do try to pull us out
[1:30:27] of that perfect will of God so this is
[1:30:30] the perfect will of God for you and
[1:30:33] I we will pray for those who
[1:30:36] despitefully use
[1:30:40] us and we will absolutely hate no one
[1:30:46] amen we hate sin but we don't hate The
[1:30:51] Sinner we pray for their poor
[1:30:54] yeah is that right notice as he changes
[1:30:58] it now and he goes to balam he said
[1:30:59] balam used this phony text so I guess
[1:31:03] bam must have preached and he used this
[1:31:05] phony text for his own conscience sake
[1:31:08] because actually he wanted that money
[1:31:12] and he wanted that dignitary he wanted
[1:31:15] that he wanted that job he wanted that
[1:31:18] position to be Lo up to as doctor so and
[1:31:21] so so he said I I'll try again all at
[1:31:24] the BMS in the world tonight promised
[1:31:30] positions
[1:31:32] popularity my oh my they numb their
[1:31:38] conscience by
[1:31:42] them so they numb their conscience by
[1:31:45] offer of
[1:31:50] position Lord Jesus speak to us today
[1:31:59] father because of their denominations
[1:32:01] they say if you do that out you go and
[1:32:05] just in case you don't know it that
[1:32:08] ain't just SE in the denominations
[1:32:10] that's so in our message if you don't
[1:32:12] agree with some of our preachers they'll
[1:32:14] absolutely cut you off they'll have
[1:32:17] nothing else to do with you you want to
[1:32:19] know how I know that do you
[1:32:24] you can't preach our Doctrine says you
[1:32:26] can't do that doct so and so said this
[1:32:29] is the way it is now you've got to
[1:32:31] believe at this way if you stay with us
[1:32:33] and you know what's so sad that same
[1:32:35] spirit is right around our ranks so if
[1:32:38] you don't agree with us 100% we're not
[1:32:40] even going to call you brother no more
[1:32:42] I'll tell you one thing I think it's
[1:32:43] narrow and on down where ain't going to
[1:32:45] hardly be none of us left just remember
[1:32:47] Elijah you've got the wrong Spirit on
[1:32:50] you oh yeah that goes with the Elijah
[1:32:53] anointing on all right but God had to
[1:32:55] correct that he said listen boy I've got
[1:32:57] 7,000 that ain't bowed the knee to bail
[1:33:01] Elijah thought he was the only one it
[1:33:03] tends to go with this message well it's
[1:33:05] only us and our church our four and no
[1:33:07] more you need to wake up there's people
[1:33:10] around the world that ain't never heard
[1:33:12] the name Word of Life Church they ain't
[1:33:14] never heard the name Donnie Reagan Tim
[1:33:16] puit Ron Spencer Wayne Lawson but
[1:33:19] they've heard the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:21] and they know that God sent a prophet in
[1:33:24] the last days and they will be right
[1:33:26] there with us in the morning of the
[1:33:32] Resurrection oh
[1:33:35] my so they numb their
[1:33:39] conscience let's jump down here to the
[1:33:41] next paragraph 149 so now remember when
[1:33:44] he come the second night now here come
[1:33:46] Dr balum he come the second night with
[1:33:50] this great celebrity already his
[1:33:52] conscience
[1:33:54] dull and
[1:33:57] numb God let him
[1:34:00] go now God never changed his
[1:34:05] mind but God gave him his permissive
[1:34:09] will go
[1:34:10] ahead go ahead then but he found out
[1:34:14] it'll not work God
[1:34:16] knew that was in balam's heart though he
[1:34:22] was prophet
[1:34:25] oh my goodness a
[1:34:29] prophet a
[1:34:32] prophet he know how he hated them Holy
[1:34:36] Rollers he's just going to want to curse
[1:34:38] them
[1:34:39] anyhow and God told him not to do it but
[1:34:42] yet he come wanted to do it so God let
[1:34:46] him go
[1:34:48] ahead and God
[1:34:51] said go ahead
[1:34:56] women want to say God called them to
[1:34:58] preach I say go ahead and preach
[1:35:03] sister I don't know if you've run across
[1:35:05] it before and the discernments of not
[1:35:07] but you will find God's Prophet calling
[1:35:08] women preachers out and say you're
[1:35:10] you're called to be a preacher or you're
[1:35:12] a woman preacher
[1:35:14] rather why it's what she wanted to hear
[1:35:18] but that don't change the word amen you
[1:35:20] see friends this is one of the last
[1:35:22] pulls to the bride
[1:35:24] things will be shaken before her that
[1:35:27] are permissive
[1:35:29] will will we take
[1:35:31] permissive or do we say no Lord no no we
[1:35:34] don't want none of that I've done been
[1:35:36] born that way I've done had enough of
[1:35:38] that all my life what about the rest of
[1:35:39] you permissive will ain't going to put
[1:35:42] us in the
[1:35:45] Rapture but he wanted wanted to do it
[1:35:48] again so God let him go ahead said go
[1:35:50] ahead now remember never changed his
[1:35:52] mind God never changed his mind about
[1:35:54] his word but he is a good
[1:35:57] god and he'll give you the
[1:36:00] desire of your
[1:36:03] heart
[1:36:05] though it be
[1:36:08] against his
[1:36:16] will I am so
[1:36:19] glad that I reached the spot
[1:36:23] concerning my daughter
[1:36:30] Erica I wanted her to live so
[1:36:36] bad but I reached the
[1:36:40] spot that if it be the will of
[1:36:44] God if it breaks my heart heart of her
[1:36:47] daughter's heart of her husband her
[1:36:48] mother or sister her church family all
[1:36:51] the rest of you loved ones and Friends
[1:36:55] so what if God would have granted our
[1:36:57] desire and said well you all want Erica
[1:37:00] to live so bad I'm going to let her
[1:37:02] live and then something terrible
[1:37:07] happened remember the little stats clap
[1:37:09] baby brother Brenham told the mother she
[1:37:11] said brother Brenham didn't I have faith
[1:37:12] he said sister when God said no you had
[1:37:15] great
[1:37:16] faith and he said you know where that
[1:37:18] baby is now and you can go to her if you
[1:37:22] bring her back
[1:37:24] it may not be
[1:37:27] so so you see God says no sometimes
[1:37:31] sometimes God says wait a while but the
[1:37:34] scary thing about it is what if G God
[1:37:36] gives us what we
[1:37:39] want so what if those that have gone on
[1:37:42] and and we say to a premature grave and
[1:37:45] we say well I don't understand why God
[1:37:46] took this one and why God took that one
[1:37:49] sister wonder what if God would have
[1:37:51] granted you your heart's desire and I
[1:37:53] was there with you and Scotty in the
[1:37:55] room the last moments of brother Jim's
[1:37:58] life and we would have said no God
[1:38:02] no it's our desire let him live and God
[1:38:05] would have said I
[1:38:08] will but it's not my perfect
[1:38:14] will and something would have happened
[1:38:16] to brother Jim that would have somehow
[1:38:19] flawed his character
[1:38:26] all
[1:38:27] because of our selfishness come on
[1:38:32] now

[1:38:39] praying I want this I want that I I want
[1:38:43] to do this I going to do this watch this
[1:38:46] now Lord Jesus speak to us father God
[1:38:51] never changes his mind his word he's a
[1:38:53] good God and he'll give you the desire
[1:38:56] of your heart though it be
[1:38:59] against his
[1:39:01] will look God told Moses you go down
[1:39:04] there the anointed Prophet you go down
[1:39:06] there and speak to that rock it's
[1:39:08] already been smitten Moses went down
[1:39:10] there in his anger picked up the rod and
[1:39:13] said you rebels must we Fest you water
[1:39:15] out of this Rock and Smoke the rock the
[1:39:18] water didn't come he smoted it again and
[1:39:20] it come it was against God's will
[1:39:24] it broke every plan in the
[1:39:28] Bible Christ had to be smitten the
[1:39:31] second
[1:39:33] time Christ was smitten once it broke
[1:39:36] the whole
[1:39:37] plan but he gave him his permissive will
[1:39:40] then after he said see we got water for
[1:39:42] you yeah I brought it for you you bunch
[1:39:44] of rebels God said come here Moses come
[1:39:47] here come up here on top now you've been
[1:39:49] a faithful servant like the woman with
[1:39:51] the high heels
[1:39:55] this is actually told the dream of women
[1:39:57] wearing high
[1:40:00] heels and they said they can do
[1:40:02] everything except for that one
[1:40:05] thing and he saw his mother saw in the
[1:40:07] dream and when she went off pitching cuz
[1:40:10] she was pitching
[1:40:12] forward screaming into the regions of
[1:40:15] the Lost what a strange occasion for him
[1:40:18] to bring it back in here why talking
[1:40:20] about permissive
[1:40:21] will oh I can do this I can do that I
[1:40:24] can do whatever I want to go
[1:40:27] ahead I'll tell you friends this scares
[1:40:29] the liver out of
[1:40:32] me I want to be so
[1:40:34] careful and what I ask him
[1:40:38] for I want to be so careful for us as a
[1:40:43] church it's what we want yes sir our
[1:40:47] desire what's our desire for our church
[1:40:49] what's our desire for our community
[1:40:51] what's our desire and what we're
[1:40:53] supposed to
[1:40:56] do what's our desire for the
[1:41:02] message you see we've already changed
[1:41:04] Generations several years ago brother
[1:41:06] Henry green passed some other older men
[1:41:08] passed and I was seeking God about the
[1:41:10] time frame that we were
[1:41:12] in and the spirit of God spoke to me
[1:41:15] these words it is The Changing of the
[1:41:21] Guard now you realize
[1:41:24] I was a much younger man then now I'm a
[1:41:27] much older man myself brother Tim some
[1:41:30] of the other brothers now we're the
[1:41:32] older men around the
[1:41:33] message before long it'll be another
[1:41:36] change of the Guard so where's the young
[1:41:39] preachers of the message going to take
[1:41:41] it
[1:41:43] to well our churches still believe in
[1:41:45] the power of God will they focus on the
[1:41:48] word or will they want something so bad
[1:41:53] that's a prophet said in the Harvest
[1:41:54] Time that Satan might let you prophesy
[1:41:57] and you prophesy something though it be
[1:41:59] a million miles off the
[1:42:02] word but yet so we can say we
[1:42:05] prophesy that's the most important thing
[1:42:08] no the most important thing is that it's
[1:42:11] by the word of
[1:42:18] God I honestly believe with all of my
[1:42:21] soul today
[1:42:24] this is where we
[1:42:27] are people are getting what they
[1:42:34] want I don't know about you I am a
[1:42:38] danger to
[1:42:41] myself am I the only
[1:42:44] one anybody else be honest who is your
[1:42:48] greatest
[1:42:49] enemy louder
[1:42:55] you are the greatest enemy that you deal
[1:42:58] with every day of your
[1:43:00] life think of what a danger that we
[1:43:04] could want something so bad and God said
[1:43:08] here you
[1:43:10] go and I'll even bless you in
[1:43:15] it and then we look at the blessing and
[1:43:18] say see there what I told you see there
[1:43:24] but yet the word says this and this and
[1:43:27] this and this and
[1:43:38] this like the woman with a high heels
[1:43:40] you climbed and you look over Yonder see
[1:43:43] the promised land oh Lord he
[1:43:48] said but you're not going over
[1:43:53] now watch he Likens this to the women
[1:43:55] with the high heels and they override
[1:43:57] the quotes you know and then he brings
[1:43:59] Moses into the same story but you're not
[1:44:01] going over you took my permissive will
[1:44:05] down here at the
[1:44:06] Rock now why didn't God say oh no no no
[1:44:10] you broke my word I ain't bringing no
[1:44:12] water out God went right ahead and
[1:44:13] brought the water out anyway mother like
[1:44:15] glory to God I'm a prophet of God I'll
[1:44:19] tell you one thing I'll tell you I broke
[1:44:21] that word and God HED me anyhow look at
[1:44:25] what I
[1:44:29] am and look at what you are now
[1:44:34] Moses on the Mountain of
[1:44:39] God so God carries him
[1:44:42] up lets him take a tour through the land
[1:44:46] and said now this is what you could have
[1:44:50] had but you know what you done you
[1:44:53] Sanctified yourself that day and made
[1:44:56] yourself look
[1:45:01] big and this is what it's going to cost
[1:45:07] you after studying
[1:45:11] this I'm going to start praying a whole
[1:45:13] lot more careful than I've ever prayed
[1:45:15] in my
[1:45:19] life it made me realize Brother D that
[1:45:22] it's a children of God we need
[1:45:24] to pray like Jesus
[1:45:28] prayed not my
[1:45:31] will but th be
[1:45:37] done if any y'all ever had to deal with
[1:45:39] some of your young ones this way you
[1:45:42] don't have to smile nod your head or
[1:45:43] anything I know you have because you've
[1:45:45] talked to me about it and you try to
[1:45:46] tell them and you try to tell them and
[1:45:48] they won't listen and what what do you
[1:45:49] do you send them to the School of Hard
[1:45:52] Knock
[1:45:54] and you try to tell them and hey I'm
[1:45:55] trying to tell you no no no no go ahead
[1:45:59] hardhead that's the way God does with us
[1:46:01] son go ahead
[1:46:07] hardhead Lord
[1:46:09] Jesus you have glorified
[1:46:14] yourself this is what ministers
[1:46:17] do when they take a gift and focus it
[1:46:21] toward themsel and they EMP emphasize me
[1:46:24] my church my Ministry my my my my
[1:46:33] my you Sanctified you glorified yourself
[1:46:36] seeing not me you Sanctified
[1:46:40] yourself now this is not used in a good
[1:46:43] complimentary way either he's setting
[1:46:45] himself apart from everybody else look
[1:46:48] what I
[1:46:50] am any you all of this
[1:46:54] let me hand you my rod Dave let me hand
[1:46:57] you my rod brother Steve let me hand you
[1:46:59] my rod let me see you do what I've
[1:47:02] done ain't none of you can do what I've
[1:47:05] done glory to
[1:47:06] God oh Jesus keep me from that
[1:47:12] thing this ain't just for preachers this
[1:47:14] morning it's for every one of you every
[1:47:17] one of you streaming
[1:47:24] Lord God you didn't sanctify me you
[1:47:27] didn't keep my original word what I told
[1:47:29] you to do yet the waters did come you
[1:47:33] can lay hands on the sick and they
[1:47:37] recover you can prophesy or speak with
[1:47:42] tongues a't that amazing it jumps from
[1:47:46] Moses to this laying hands on the sick
[1:47:50] prophesying the sick recover
[1:47:53] but the thing is keep his original
[1:47:58] word God don't change his mind
[1:48:02] friend you've got to keep his
[1:48:06] commission his
[1:48:08] will oh well that was for the disciples
[1:48:11] huh we sure don't believe that do we we
[1:48:13] believe it's for us let me close baam
[1:48:17] had a gift of faith
[1:48:23] and could have used it to the perfect
[1:48:25] original word of God many men on the
[1:48:28] field today with gifts of healing could
[1:48:32] do the same thing many men out there
[1:48:35] people speaking in tongues people
[1:48:37] prophesying a gift could use it for the
[1:48:39] kingdom of God you mean to tell
[1:48:43] me that people can speak in genuine
[1:48:46] tongues and have a genuine genuine gift
[1:48:49] of Prophecy and not even be using it for
[1:48:52] the kingdom of
[1:49:03] God but they don't do
[1:49:06] it and God blesses them
[1:49:12] anyhow and gets the permissive
[1:49:19] well but for popularity and pleasures
[1:49:21] and personal gain sold their birth
[1:49:23] rights as Esau did sold out for an
[1:49:26] organization sold out like balam did so
[1:49:28] many are doing today the same thing we
[1:49:30] know that's right they sell out their
[1:49:32] birth R home women professing the Holy
[1:49:34] Ghost wearing shorts men permitting them
[1:49:36] in the pull pits bobbed haired women in
[1:49:38] the pulpits paint on their faces
[1:49:40] religious gowns on the biggest stumbling
[1:49:43] block the church has ever had sir notice
[1:49:46] as God said to Bam after he had heard
[1:49:48] the true cut decision word don't go
[1:49:55] then he told him actually seen his in
[1:49:57] his heart what he was to do he gave him
[1:50:00] his permissive will and said go on
[1:50:05] go you know what he s well God must
[1:50:08] change his mind about his word a god
[1:50:11] messed up God learned more God knows I
[1:50:13] can help them people then H I'm going to
[1:50:15] go ahead and go God said go on when you
[1:50:17] get down there I'll give you Visions
[1:50:19] when you go down there I'll give you
[1:50:20] true prophecies cuz I've got a hold of
[1:50:23] your mouth cuz you have a prophetic gift
[1:50:26] and you have a gift of faith and it's
[1:50:32] real and you can do the same
[1:50:35] thing if you don't want to walk in the
[1:50:38] truth you can go and have a great
[1:50:41] ministry certainly you can but you're
[1:50:44] taking his permissive will you're
[1:50:45] walking over his word he'll Prosper you
[1:50:54] but he couldn't curse that people he
[1:50:55] couldn't do it because every time he
[1:50:57] started to curse he blessed he couldn't
[1:50:59] do it but when he come to being
[1:51:01] prosperous in his achievement he taught
[1:51:04] those people through through baac to
[1:51:06] commit adultery yet he grants you
[1:51:10] permission for you to permit your will a
[1:51:14] permissive will knowing what's in your
[1:51:19] heart
[1:51:23] he knows it well brother R I do so and
[1:51:25] so and so it don't bother me God blesses
[1:51:28] me every day I sing in the spirit I
[1:51:30] dance in the spirit he'll permit it oh
[1:51:34] my go ahead that's right but what are
[1:51:36] you going to do I wear shorts I do this
[1:51:38] don't bother me I know where my faith is
[1:51:41] in Christ not in what I
[1:51:45] wear sounds like a modern layer to sin
[1:51:47] on it don't you tell me God ain't but
[1:51:50] I'll tell you one thing we have people
[1:51:52] to come to the altar this and that in
[1:51:54] the world God says go
[1:51:59] ahead true
[1:52:01] brother this will be one of the final
[1:52:03] phases of
[1:52:05] separation between
[1:52:07] bride and
[1:52:09] church and hate to say it but I might as
[1:52:11] well go ahead and do it it'll be one of
[1:52:13] the dividing lines between those around
[1:52:15] the
[1:52:16] message and
[1:52:20] bread on
[1:52:26] just stand if you can if you can't we'll
[1:52:28] get ambulances to help get you
[1:52:31] up let me quot close with this one I've
[1:52:35] been closing you know how that is you
[1:52:37] going out you close the door and you
[1:52:38] stand there and talk and then you close
[1:52:39] a little bit more and you stand there
[1:52:40] and
[1:52:42] talk but God will prosper
[1:52:45] you while He blesses me I don't doubt
[1:52:49] that he blessed bam too see certainly he
[1:52:51] will you walk in his permissive will not
[1:52:53] his perfect will God don't change his
[1:52:55] mind cuz he blesses you he blessed his
[1:52:58] world right out there for 40
[1:53:00] years you imagine there's no Walmarts no
[1:53:04] grocery
[1:53:05] stores they wore the same shoes for 40
[1:53:10] years that been hard to imagine
[1:53:12] convincing a woman to be able to do that
[1:53:14] for 40 years would it I mean that excuse
[1:53:21] me I notice only the brothers are
[1:53:23] smiling well a few
[1:53:26] women brother she felt your spirit pulse
[1:53:28] at that you might as well go and smile
[1:53:30] she's do see it
[1:53:31] anyhow God C them boy they can say glory
[1:53:34] to God these are the same britches I had
[1:53:37] 40 years ago this is the same tie this
[1:53:40] is the same shirt and he looks brand new
[1:53:42] don't tell me God ain't with
[1:53:48] us but when it come to going in the land
[1:53:52] only two of them with all them
[1:53:54] blessings when in that's right Lord have
[1:53:58] mercy
[1:53:59] children I love the blessings of God but
[1:54:03] I don't want just His blessings I want
[1:54:06] his
[1:54:07] approval and he
[1:54:09] approves of his word
[1:54:14] right Lord
[1:54:17] Jesus let's jump on down to the bottom
[1:54:19] of this
[1:54:20] quote every one of them
[1:54:23] perished because they never kept his
[1:54:26] original permissive he says his original
[1:54:29] will his word they took his
[1:54:33] permissive way yes
[1:54:36] sir now we have young people in our
[1:54:39] church here that are finished Miss maybe
[1:54:41] this be the last year of their schooling
[1:54:43] some of are already changed school and
[1:54:44] they're going to college and you're
[1:54:45] looking for what you want to be and
[1:54:47] you're searching about what God wants
[1:54:49] you to be young people
[1:54:52] as your
[1:54:54] pastor let me advise you seek the Lord
[1:54:58] with all of your heart God what do you
[1:55:01] want me to do where do you want me to go
[1:55:03] what vocation what job I I I don't know
[1:55:05] Lord I don't know what to do you
[1:55:07] understand you can lose years of Your
[1:55:10] Life by One wrong
[1:55:13] choice amen and cause you to lose years
[1:55:17] of your life and you get on this detour
[1:55:19] and you go way around over here and then
[1:55:22] years years later you finally come back
[1:55:23] to where you got off of and try to
[1:55:26] resume and you lost two years three
[1:55:28] years 5 years 10 years whatever it
[1:55:33] was your sisters that are
[1:55:36] widows your brothers that are
[1:55:40] widowers God in his wisdom chose your
[1:55:42] companion to take them on to
[1:55:44] Glory but that does not mean your life
[1:55:47] is over or
[1:55:49] ended so go to him who took your husband
[1:55:52] go to him who took your
[1:55:55] wife and say Lord God what do you want
[1:55:57] me to do with the rest of my life I feel
[1:55:59] without a purpose I feel Without a
[1:56:01] Cause well there's one thing I know for
[1:56:03] sure God does not want you spending the
[1:56:06] rest of your life focusing on
[1:56:09] yourself what you want I want this I
[1:56:11] want to do that I don't want to be
[1:56:12] around nobody else no I I know that for
[1:56:14] sure I may not know what you're supposed
[1:56:16] to do but I know the spirit of God never
[1:56:18] leads us to selfishness to focus just on
[1:56:21] me
[1:56:23] some of you sisters reach out to one
[1:56:25] another you've got something in common
[1:56:28] that the married sisters that have their
[1:56:29] husbands they don't have they cannot
[1:56:32] relate to the loneliness that you feel
[1:56:34] sisters some of the brothers in our
[1:56:36] church that are wiers reach out to one
[1:56:38] another be a
[1:56:40] friend you see if there's any failure
[1:56:43] I'm afraid that many of us have it's
[1:56:46] this natural side of the church body oh
[1:56:49] you pray for the minister you pray for
[1:56:51] this and you pray why the mystical is
[1:56:54] where we focus so
[1:56:56] much but how many hurting people come to
[1:56:58] our church just waiting for somebody to
[1:57:01] say a kind word to
[1:57:03] them and they come Sunday after Sunday
[1:57:05] or Wednesday after Wednesday and nobody
[1:57:07] even goes out of the way to welcome
[1:57:10] them we don't want that kind of
[1:57:12] reputation in our
[1:57:15] church you may never be best buddies
[1:57:18] with them but you're going to spend
[1:57:20] eternity with them aren't you sure you
[1:57:21] going to speak to every now and
[1:57:23] then let them know I don't know that I
[1:57:25] know you God God bless you it's good to
[1:57:27] be in fellowship with you let's not just
[1:57:31] focus on the mystical the great
[1:57:33] Supernatural
[1:57:34] body so much of the Epistles in the New
[1:57:37] Testament are written
[1:57:40] concerning the local
[1:57:42] assembly the gifts the issues the
[1:57:45] problems the healings the Natural Things
[1:57:49] the orchestration of the body how the
[1:57:51] ministry should focus how the church
[1:57:53] should run so much of the word is about
[1:57:59] such how many loves him with all your
[1:58:03] heart how many today with all of your
[1:58:05] heart you want to pray more
[1:58:08] sincerely about choices you
[1:58:11] make in
[1:58:13] life and what you do with the rest of
[1:58:16] your life now keep this in mind and many
[1:58:18] of you already know it God many times
[1:58:21] his will
[1:58:22] he will not send us where we want to
[1:58:25] go you want to know how I know
[1:58:28] that I didn't want to come

[1:58:38] family there that little church I
[1:58:40] started there I was very happy being

[1:59:29] derogatory now but they're hitchhikers
[1:59:31] they enjoy the blessings they enjoy this
[1:59:33] but they don't say here in the local
[1:59:35] assembly it's not just me that makes
[1:59:37] these Services what they are it's you
[1:59:40] it's you you praying for me you pulled
[1:59:42] it and once they come here many of them
[1:59:44] say oh brother Donnie my I didn't
[1:59:46] realize how B he was I said well of
[1:59:48] course not the devil never identified
[1:59:49] you with some Ministry but once you come
[1:59:52] here you're a part of it you got this
[1:59:53] great big old X all over your back all
[1:59:56] hell is going to be against you but if
[1:59:58] God sent you strap on your armor let's
[2:00:00] go we're going to heaven so he may not
[2:00:03] send you where you want to go he may not
[2:00:05] even call you to be what you think you
[2:00:07] ought to
[2:00:09] be but the thing of it is do you want
[2:00:12] his
[2:00:14] desire or
[2:00:17] yours I have to be honest with you this
[2:00:19] morning friend sometimes I wish I was
[2:00:21] never called to be a
[2:00:23] preacher much of what I go through in my
[2:00:25] life has nothing to do with me as an
[2:00:27] individual it's God's people what I've
[2:00:31] had to preach things I've had to stand
[2:00:34] on I'm not a
[2:00:37] troublemaker people think I am but I'm
[2:00:39] not it's because they don't know me I'm
[2:00:41] a peacemaker I love peace I just love
[2:00:45] getting along with people if you can I'm
[2:00:48] glad God didn't leave it to my choice CU
[2:00:49] I would not be standing here today and
[2:00:52] some of you wouldn't be standing where
[2:00:54] you are what about it Deacon Brothers
[2:00:56] some of y'all wouldn't still be deacons
[2:00:57] you done been gone a long time ago D
[2:01:00] with a bunch of these sorry people I
[2:01:01] mean these wonderful blessed holy Saints
[2:01:07] here some of you here today and you
[2:01:09] don't even want to be here I know you
[2:01:11] don't some of you have told me you'd
[2:01:13] rather be in this church and that church
[2:01:15] and this state and that state that ain't
[2:01:17] but half the story I wish You' have win
[2:01:24] [Laughter]
[2:01:30] unless of
[2:01:32] course God wants you here
[2:01:37] that's then if God wants you
[2:01:40] here then you won't be happy anywhere
[2:01:43] else and I won't
[2:01:48] either because actually we help one
[2:01:50] another your problems and your issues
[2:01:53] and my problems and my issues and God
[2:01:57] knew how to put us together didn't
[2:02:00] he let's B together if you
[2:02:07] would I wonder where every head
[2:02:11] bowed brother Bram said he blessed
[2:02:13] Israel right there for 40 years what
[2:02:15] they do married wives raised
[2:02:18] families kissed the children paid their
[2:02:23] guys lived a pretty good life would say
[2:02:25] man that's that's a good believer in
[2:02:27] this day that's a good
[2:02:29] Christian and totally in the permissive
[2:02:31] will of God and not a one of them got to
[2:02:34] cross over and we don't want to live our
[2:02:36] lives that
[2:02:37] way so whether you're a young person

[2:03:22] sure whenever you feel to do
[2:03:26] something that God isn't just giving you
[2:03:29] what you
[2:03:30] want but it lines up with his
[2:03:34] call how many times have I heard those
[2:03:37] words I feel
[2:03:43] led I feel
[2:03:47] Le it can be some of the most
[2:03:49] devastating words that people ever say I
[2:03:53] feel led to do this I feel led to do
[2:03:56] that I feel led to go here I feel led to
[2:03:59] do something
[2:04:00] else check it

[2:04:18] your life many of you like myself have
[2:04:21] made some bad choices oh yeah you've
[2:04:24] made some bad and wrong choices wrong
[2:04:27] counsel of others maybe just
[2:04:30] yourself but may God help
[2:04:34] us heavenly
[2:04:38] father I know this is
[2:04:43] sobering father we're asking you that
[2:04:45] you would help
[2:04:47] us Lord being the pastor I know that I'm
[2:04:52] more
[2:04:54] responsible than any other individual as
[2:04:56] far as the individuals go in the
[2:05:01] church I have a
[2:05:04] great responsibility to answer for it
[2:05:07] that
[2:05:08] day
[2:05:09] because I can set the
[2:05:12] tone the direction of our
[2:05:15] church so if I get off on a
[2:05:19] tangent on a Siri and I
[2:05:23] ideology I could use my influence that
[2:05:26] you gave me not only here in this church
[2:05:28] but around the
[2:05:30] world and that's why it scares me so
[2:05:33] much Lord because I realize one day I'm
[2:05:36] going to have to answer for all of that
[2:05:37] God help me help
[2:05:41] me if they could see me back there in my
[2:05:44] office before I come
[2:05:46] out walking back and forth and pacing in
[2:05:49] my office ringing my my hands and
[2:05:52] praying and asking you to help
[2:05:56] me I pray no matter how old I get and
[2:05:59] how long I've preach that I never get
[2:06:00] over that all of that
[2:06:05] responsibility help me that I can use
[2:06:07] what you've given me to influence your
[2:06:10] people in the right
[2:06:12] way Lord Jesus then here it comes down
[2:06:15] to every
[2:06:16] man every woman every boy every girl may
[2:06:20] these parents realize they have the
[2:06:23] capability of setting their children in
[2:06:26] a direction of righteousness or if they
[2:06:29] have bitterness in their heart and
[2:06:31] grievance against me or a grievance
[2:06:33] against some other preacher or some
[2:06:35] other person in the church their
[2:06:38] children listen to them talk about me
[2:06:41] their children listen to them talk about
[2:06:43] whoever else it is in the church their
[2:06:46] children pick up on that resentment and
[2:06:48] that
[2:06:49] attitude then it'll go from d dadd and
[2:06:52] from Mama down to their boys then if
[2:06:56] their boys grow up and they become
[2:06:57] married men and then that other family
[2:07:00] still comes to the church then they can
[2:07:02] hand it down to theirs on down on
[2:07:06] down or we have the capability of
[2:07:09] stopping it let it stop here
[2:07:15] Lord Lord Jesus I pray you would help me
[2:07:19] father as The Shepherd of the Sheep
[2:07:22] dear God I beg you tonight today I'll
[2:07:25] get on my
[2:07:26] face I'll get on my hands and my knees
[2:07:30] and bow before you on my
[2:07:33] face and not raise up off of this
[2:07:36] platform till the Midnight Hour if need
[2:07:39] be if I want something
[2:07:42] wrong please don't give it to
[2:07:45] me may I always have a correct Spirit
[2:07:49] about me yes that I can be corrected by
[2:07:53] the
[2:07:54] word help me Lord not to get so caught
[2:07:57] up in the
[2:08:00] Supernatural help me to not get so
[2:08:02] caught up in whatever it might be that I
[2:08:04] want it so bad that I'll overstep
[2:08:08] scripture I'll overstep the teaching of
[2:08:11] your Vindicated Prophet because I want
[2:08:13] it so
[2:08:15] bad and you'll say all right
[2:08:18] Donnie go ahead
[2:08:22] I'll bless you in
[2:08:24] it but it ain't my
[2:08:27] word no Lord
[2:08:30] please please
[2:08:34] Jesus may my heart the hearts of my
[2:08:39] brothers the hearts of my
[2:08:42] sisters may it be sensitive towards you
[2:08:44] Lord
[2:08:47] God how many here with me today is
[2:08:50] willing to raise your hand hands before
[2:08:52] the
[2:08:53] Lord Lord God be mindful of
[2:08:56] me God if I want something contrary to
[2:08:58] your will don't give me my desire
[2:09:01] correct me
[2:09:02] Lord correct
[2:09:05] me no doubt the Lord must have struck
[2:09:08] Moses heart something must have happened
[2:09:11] that God tried to delay that from
[2:09:13] happening as the spirit of God must have
[2:09:15] struck David's heart that day before he
[2:09:17] took bash Sheba God is so faithful
[2:09:21] and the same with
[2:09:24] us a little funny feeling a question in
[2:09:27] your mind a little something
[2:09:30] there as I said several years ago and I
[2:09:33] heard a preacher as he was talking to me
[2:09:35] and saying that he felt led to do such
[2:09:38] and such and so and so he was sitting in
[2:09:40] a service where I was preaching and he
[2:09:43] said while you was preaching there today
[2:09:45] the word it just oh it just so pricked
[2:09:47] me and I I begin to wonder about what I
[2:09:50] was what I had in my heart I thought
[2:09:52] well maybe I shouldn't maybe I
[2:09:54] shouldn't but then I thought no no no
[2:09:57] it's just it's just probably
[2:10:00] me little did the man
[2:10:03] know you were questioning trying to stop
[2:10:06] him but he overwrote
[2:10:09] it went on and brought such
[2:10:12] chaos and
[2:10:15] catastrophe oh keep us
[2:10:19] Jesus Keep Us us Jesus by your
[2:10:24] grace come let us adore
[2:10:28] him now as it's already been said this
[2:10:31] morning here we are at the Christmas
[2:10:32] season we know Jesus wasn't born this
[2:10:34] time of the year but it's a time that
[2:10:37] set aside anyway where people say they
[2:10:40] come to worship
[2:10:42] him so while we're talking about giving
[2:10:46] and all that sort of thing why don't we
[2:10:50] give to the Lord
[2:10:52] Jesus the thing he wants more than
[2:10:55] anything else our
[2:10:58] will our
[2:11:00] desires I want the kind of heart desire
[2:11:03] brother Jim that the Lord Jesus could
[2:11:05] say to me I'll give you
[2:11:08] anything you want or ask
[2:11:13] for because he and I
[2:11:15] Fellowship so much that he knows I would
[2:11:19] never ask for anything anything say that
[2:11:21] would displease
[2:11:23] him how many wants that kind of
[2:11:26] heart what if that means he has to take
[2:11:29] your daughter or your
[2:11:32] son I heard brother Brown tell it this
[2:11:34] week that there was a young man and a
[2:11:35] young woman in his service and they were
[2:11:38] sitting there carrying on real vulgarly
[2:11:40] in service well the word he used was the
[2:11:42] boy was trying to make love to the
[2:11:44] girl and he said it was disrupting the
[2:11:47] service and people around him and he
[2:11:50] said the spirit of God spoke to him and
[2:11:51] said whatever you say will
[2:11:57] happen so he had the power of life and
[2:12:01] death right there if he would have
[2:12:03] called for it God would have taken their
[2:12:05] lives in the service so he paused for a
[2:12:09] few minutes brother Rudy to wait Lord
[2:12:11] what do you want me to do I I love that
[2:12:13] what do you want me to do he gave him
[2:12:16] the say but he didn't know what to do
[2:12:18] with it that's bride Mater friends oh we
[2:12:23] want power and it's evident we don't
[2:12:24] know what to do with it but what we need
[2:12:26] is that kind of
[2:12:28] Desire then the Lord can give us the
[2:12:30] power that we need before the
[2:12:34] resurrection so he said I forgive
[2:12:38] them I forgive
[2:12:41] them and he said that's what he wanted
[2:12:44] me to
[2:12:48] say let's worship him together
[2:12:51] come let us adore him we'll be gathering
[2:12:54] here again this afternoon 5:30 you're
