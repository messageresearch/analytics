[45:27] yes sir yes sir only kidding don't don't
[45:29] leave only only
[45:31] kidding Romans chapter 7 verse
[45:36] one praise the Lord what an awesome day
[45:39] to be serving the
[45:42] lord know you're not brethren for I
[45:44] speak to them that know the
[45:47] law how that the law hath dominion over
[45:49] a man as long as he liveth for the woman
[45:54] which hath an husband is bound by the
[45:56] law to her her husband so long as he
[45:59] liveth but if the husband be dead she is
[46:02] loosed from the law of her husband now
[46:06] remember he not talking about the law of
[46:07] Moses he's talking about the law of a
[46:10] husband so then if while her husband
[46:12] live us she'd be married to another
[46:16] man listen now she'd be married to
[46:20] another man she shall be
[46:24] called an adulteress
[46:27] but if her
[46:28] husband be dead she's free from that law
[46:34] what law the law of her
[46:36] husband so that she is no adulteress
[46:39] though she be married to another man
[46:43] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[46:46] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[46:50] isn't that strange so he jumps from the
[46:53] woman then to Christ and so how Christ
[46:56] had to die
[46:58] so my brethren you also are become dead
[47:00] to the law by the body of Christ that
[47:02] you should be married to another even to
[47:06] him who is
[47:08] raised from the dead married to to
[47:12] Christ now raised from the dead that we
[47:15] should bring forth fruit unto God Amen
[47:19] how many like to be remember today as we
[47:21] just ask the Lord to help us and speak
[47:23] to us from his word father thank you so
[47:25] much for the opportunity that we can be
[47:27] together today Lord one more time dear
[47:30] God as we're here in time and we're
[47:33] trying Lord Jesus to be able to present
[47:35] the Living Word in this age to a dying
[47:38] people a dying age our nation is so
[47:41] rotten and corrupt our world is so
[47:44] rotten Wars rumors of wars terrible
[47:47] times difficulties anxiety heartaches
[47:51] sickness everywhere Lord but I thank
[47:54] Father that sometimes you allow these
[47:56] things to happen to us to where it will
[47:58] make us so homesick for a place where
[48:01] there is none of those things dear Jesus
[48:04] help us today as we look into your word
[48:06] May the presence of God speak to us I
[48:09] bind the devil in the name of Jesus you
[48:12] evil spirit that would try to hinder us
[48:14] this morning I'm just going to go ahead
[48:16] and tell you right now you are defeated
[48:19] in the name of Jesus Christ father take
[48:22] charge of the service have your way
[48:24] today we pray in the name of Jesus and
[48:27] the Saints said amen amen God bless you
[48:30] you may may be seated Saints we
[48:32] appreciate you
[48:33] today how good the Lord is to
[48:36] us uh I'd like to to resume on on this
[48:40] quote here that we looked at a week or
[48:42] so ago um and come back to what oh watch
[48:49] wow
[48:51] um that whenever the prophet was dealing
[48:53] with this in invisible Union that there
[48:56] was a spiritual side to marriage and
[49:00] divorce and we truly believe that uh we
[49:03] believe that God in his Mercy is open to
[49:05] us as brother Joel Brown just sang to us
[49:08] a while ago the message according to
[49:10] Malachi 4 I realize to the majority of
[49:14] the law of the world today to hear that
[49:15] song they would think what in the world
[49:17] are them people even talking about to
[49:20] hear us preach under the inspiration of
[49:22] Malachi 4 that do the same thing it's
[49:25] sad because even sometimes those who
[49:28] claim that they believe this message
[49:31] wind up being in the same way they see
[49:33] no no significance of trying to bring
[49:37] the word of God of the hour under the
[49:39] inspiration of Malachi 4 so they're
[49:41] still preaching the same Bible stories
[49:42] that they preached for decades and it's
[49:44] producing basically the same results but
[49:47] we are a people that are looking for a
[49:50] Rapture I'm not looking just for me to
[49:52] get old and the older people here to get
[49:54] old and the young people come on and
[49:56] take it then another generation happens
[49:58] on and on and on I believe with all of
[50:00] my heart we're the people that's going
[50:01] to break this cycle amen and the church
[50:05] said so if we are it's going to take
[50:08] something to be able to help us get into
[50:10] that sphere with God you believe that
[50:13] notice this he says Paul is here giving
[50:14] us an illustration in the scripture
[50:17] about that law and Grace now watch law
[50:21] and Grace and illustrating it like
[50:23] marriage and divorce this p passage is
[50:27] very seldom preached on because it's
[50:29] more or less pertains to like marriage
[50:32] and divorce but it also pertains to a
[50:36] greater portion of marriage and divorce
[50:39] so there there is in the natural portion
[50:41] of marriage and divorce and there is a
[50:44] spiritual portion of marriage and
[50:46] divorce now watch he says of how that
[50:49] he's trying to set in order here that we
[50:51] as a church but I believe also it is to
[50:55] my beliefs that that it unfolds one of
[50:58] the great mysteries of Prophecy so
[51:02] prophecy is what it's something that God
[51:05] foretells by inspired men of God
[51:08] everybody doesn't have access to
[51:10] prophecy everybody doesn't have access
[51:12] to understand prophecy once it's been
[51:15] revealed so prophecy can come by words
[51:18] it can come by symbols it can come by
[51:21] signs as it did in Isaiah 7 Whenever
[51:24] there was a su dial that was s it and he
[51:27] said to ahaz and he says go and prophesy
[51:31] to ahaz and it very peculiar that a Sund
[51:34] would be set and then you would come
[51:36] with one of the greatest prophecies ever
[51:37] known to man and then the Lord tells
[51:40] Isaiah go tell him this Behold a virgin
[51:43] shall conceive and bring forth a son and
[51:46] you called his name Emmanuel who in the
[51:49] right mind would ever make any
[51:51] connection between a su dial which is
[51:54] the way they would be able to tell the
[51:56] time of the day and they had this dial
[51:58] it had a hand on it and the way the
[52:00] shadow would reflect from the angle of
[52:02] the sun they knew what time of the day
[52:04] it was thank God for watches but out of
[52:07] that God would take a prophecy and
[52:10] prophesy about a virgin birth you
[52:12] imagine this has never happened before
[52:14] so a virgin is going to conceive and
[52:16] bring forth a child and will call his
[52:19] name wonderful counselor Mighty God the
[52:21] Everlasting father the prince of peace
[52:24] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[52:26] how strange that would have been and no
[52:29] doubt the people of that day laughed at
[52:31] it and said Isaiah has lost his mind who
[52:34] ever heard of a virgin conceiv you
[52:37] imagine taking that prophecy to the
[52:39] doctors now doctor I was in church
[52:42] yesterday and I heard this man who
[52:44] claims to be a prophet say that a virgin
[52:47] would conceive and that doctor could say
[52:49] so now that no doubt it was that Jewish
[52:52] Church where they believe in prophets
[52:54] and Pillar of Fire and signs and wonders
[52:57] and all that stuff right well yall just
[52:59] so happened to be that's where I was
[53:01] going to church well you ought to had
[53:02] better sense than to go to such a church
[53:05] as that now if you would have been
[53:08] waiting to be able to live and see if
[53:11] Isaiah's prophecy ever come to pass
[53:14] guess what you would have died long
[53:17] before you ever saw it come to pass so
[53:21] some prophecies of prophets come to pass
[53:24] in the generation or the lifetime of the
[53:27] people who hear it said so how you going
[53:29] to judge this
[53:31] man how you going to judge this man
[53:33] Isaiah he said I'm going to wait to see
[53:35] if it comes to pass none of those people
[53:38] that heard it were alive when it did so
[53:42] how you going to judge that he was a
[53:44] Prophet come on children there's still
[53:46] prophecies in Micah that have not yet
[53:49] come to pass there's prophecies in the
[53:52] book of Jeremiah in the book of Isaiah
[53:55] in the Book of Ezekiel in the Book of
[53:57] Malachi that have not yet come to pass
[54:01] how we going to know these men were
[54:02] prophets because we see the continuity
[54:05] of the inspiration of God being on them
[54:08] when they were here and that gives us
[54:11] Faith to believe that what they said in
[54:13] the future will also come to pass so in
[54:17] other words if a prophet is standing
[54:19] there and telling you you've been to a
[54:20] doctor there's three steps that goes up
[54:23] to your house you live on 126 Springs
[54:26] Street your doctor is a heavy set man
[54:28] wears glasses he told you you had so and
[54:31] so and so and so then when that Prophet
[54:34] comes back and said thus sayeth the Lord
[54:37] Los Angeles will sink that gives us hope
[54:40] to know those things will also come to
[54:43] pass you see that's the way God uses his
[54:47] prophets and the church said he will
[54:50] vindicate them by the present tense
[54:53] which gives us a consolation that what
[54:56] are going to say in the future will also
[55:00] come to pass so I find it amazing
[55:03] because the prophet never actually
[55:04] mentioned this anywhere else quite like
[55:07] this an invisible Union but it set forth
[55:10] that there was a great spiritual
[55:12] understanding to marriage and divorce
[55:14] now I for one I don't like preaching on
[55:16] marriage and divorce most of us probably
[55:18] don't like talking about it we don't
[55:20] like hearing about it because it's a
[55:22] very controversial subject and it's a
[55:24] painful subject for folks who who' been
[55:26] there and it's a very difficult one but
[55:29] when I go to preaching on this spiritual
[55:31] side I have to say I do enjoy it because
[55:35] I've experienced it now I've also
[55:38] experienced marriage and divorce in a
[55:41] more sense that's more real to me than
[55:44] maybe some of you who are sitting here
[55:46] today and you've not had that new birth
[55:49] oh brother Donnie I thought you talking
[55:50] about marriage and divorce not the new
[55:52] birth no I'm talking about actually both
[55:55] because the New Birth is the
[55:58] spiritualization of marriage and divorce
[56:01] oh he said where'd you get that at I got
[56:03] it from The Book of Romans because said
[56:05] Paul's talking about us being married
[56:08] under the law of our first husband and
[56:11] then by the body of Christ which was the
[56:14] proof that the token was released out of
[56:17] his body so the body died so when we
[56:20] look at the body it is an evidence that
[56:23] something left the body you see when
[56:26] those Hebrew Believers and they took the
[56:29] lamb and they killed the lamb according
[56:31] to what the prophet told them and they
[56:33] took the blood and use the blood as a
[56:36] paint and they paint it over the Len and
[56:38] the doorpost of their house now that's
[56:40] what they do with the chemistry then
[56:42] they take the body and they roast the
[56:45] body with fire and with bitter herbs and
[56:48] unleavened bread so they had one
[56:50] significance on the door and they have
[56:53] another significance in their body
[56:55] because they're taking the carcass of
[56:58] the Lamb which means the life's lamb the
[57:01] lamb has given its life its blood is
[57:04] gone and their name is protected by the
[57:07] blood now they take the Flesh of the
[57:10] lamb and eat that flesh and it becomes a
[57:14] part of who they are as a matter of fact
[57:16] some of them their bodies were changed
[57:19] if they were crippled then they was able
[57:21] to walk out of the land of bondage is
[57:24] that right the Bible tells us that was
[57:26] not one e one even those that were
[57:29] feeble or were crippled because they so
[57:33] partook of that lamb it brought them a
[57:36] body change amen that's what we're
[57:39] looking for is it not so they had an
[57:41] Evidence then because they did not take
[57:44] just a life out of the lamb and
[57:47] disassociate thems from the chemistry of
[57:49] the blood or disassociate them from the
[57:53] Flesh of the Lamb you see this is what
[57:55] modern religion
[57:56] does it disassociates those who
[57:59] participate just in the organized
[58:02] religion term and their identified with
[58:05] a thought or a theory or a story a Bible
[58:09] story of a man who gave his life they
[58:12] don't partake of his flesh word so they
[58:15] don't eat of that word to become the
[58:18] body that God can house in but they're
[58:22] identified with a thought with a the
[58:25] with the story story that happened 2,000
[58:27] years ago but I'm so glad today I'm not
[58:31] just identified with
[58:33] history I'm identified today with a
[58:36] person who's right here in this building
[58:38] this morning and the church said amen
[58:42] now you see what we can see from the the
[58:45] example that Paul is using that he takes
[58:47] a natural man and woman and he use his n
[58:50] the natural side of marriage and divorce
[58:53] and then he projects it he leaves the th
[58:56] Romans 7 no doubt it was probed that for
[58:58] years and years and yet many of the
[59:00] theologians tried to look at it and
[59:02] understand it but in our reality the
[59:04] mystery of Romans 7 was left for the
[59:07] last day when the son of man would
[59:11] return back among his people you see
[59:14] under the administration of the son of
[59:17] man at his first Advent in a body form
[59:20] now we know the prophets will call son
[59:22] of man but yet they were a temporary
[59:24] house by which the presence of God would
[59:26] live in with a promise that as it was in
[59:29] the days of Sodom so shall it be when
[59:32] the son of man comes back again now many
[59:35] people try to catch that scripture in
[59:37] Matthew 24 and Luke 17 and identify it
[59:40] with the Corporal return but the son of
[59:43] man is not always Corporal body the son
[59:47] of man is a personal presence of the
[59:51] manifestation of God by which he comes
[59:53] down at a special time in season on the
[59:57] earth to make his way known it requires
[1:00:01] that to we that the little bitty light
[1:00:04] the shining through the church ages and
[1:00:06] and the temporary times when the
[1:00:08] prophets are here is not enough to bring
[1:00:11] the illumination that the people need
[1:00:13] for that hour so he comes down himself
[1:00:16] in a very secretive form to reveal
[1:00:20] something that he wants to make known he
[1:00:23] don't even just leave it to prophets to
[1:00:25] do it he doesn't leave it just to the
[1:00:27] ministry to do it but he will come down
[1:00:31] himself now how anxious the Lord Jesus
[1:00:34] has been for this hour now here we are
[1:00:37] when we're November 25th
[1:00:39] 1965 the opening of the seals now have
[1:00:42] transpired and and of course we know in
[1:00:44] March in 63 and there's been some great
[1:00:47] things that's unfolded down to this but
[1:00:50] this particular part of the mystery of
[1:00:53] God had not yet been revealed and what
[1:00:56] we're going to look at this morning now
[1:00:58] remember God had his Prophet here so
[1:01:00] he's got to speak it while it's on his
[1:01:02] heart now so then we when we are born
[1:01:06] every one of us receive the exact same
[1:01:09] thing in the sense that we were born
[1:01:12] between Satan and Eve so we were married
[1:01:14] our first husband that had the rule over
[1:01:16] us was our natural nature that was our
[1:01:20] husband so as soon as we broke the womb
[1:01:23] of our mother and we took the the breath
[1:01:26] of life and God breathed into us the
[1:01:29] Breath of Life our name goes on a book
[1:01:33] under the oaces of that book when we
[1:01:36] come to the age of accountability that
[1:01:38] sins are attributed to us no longer just
[1:01:41] our mother our father our grandparents
[1:01:43] and so on but we become responsible and
[1:01:46] accountable when that happens that old
[1:01:49] life of that old nature and it starts
[1:01:52] dominating us and whatever your nature
[1:01:54] is maybe you're a powder maybe you're a
[1:01:57] you know you're a high temper T maybe
[1:01:59] you're a person that can't forgive
[1:02:00] people and you hold grudges well
[1:02:03] whatever you are then that was the
[1:02:05] nature that ruled over you that
[1:02:08] dominated the majority of your life
[1:02:11] until you would be able to be released
[1:02:14] from that husband now watch again he
[1:02:17] says let's look at this first Union
[1:02:19] again an invisible union now it was
[1:02:21] nature associated with death your first
[1:02:25] husband that had the rule over you was
[1:02:27] your Nature by natural birth natural you
[1:02:30] love the world because you are the world
[1:02:33] so you're not just of it but you are the
[1:02:36] world you're you are part of the world
[1:02:40] and that's the way you are naturally we
[1:02:43] cannot help that God don't send people
[1:02:45] to hell because they're born lost he
[1:02:48] sends them to hell because they choose
[1:02:50] to stay
[1:02:51] lost and that's your natural thing
[1:02:54] that's the reason you have to be born
[1:02:55] again again you have to separate you
[1:02:58] have to die to that first husband you
[1:03:01] can't live with it you can't say well
[1:03:03] I'll divorce him and hang him up there
[1:03:05] to the occasion no sir no writing of
[1:03:08] divorcement he dies the nature of the
[1:03:11] world has to die now notice carefully
[1:03:14] every Speck of him has to die you have
[1:03:17] to be reunited again with another nature
[1:03:21] now this is what he's talking about of
[1:03:23] the greater portion of marriage and
[1:03:25] divorce so this is part of the mystery
[1:03:28] that's to be revealed in the last day
[1:03:31] again he says your name of your first
[1:03:35] nature was born and put into a book of
[1:03:39] life now listen your name that you was
[1:03:42] born under was put in a book called The
[1:03:45] Book of Life all your Deeds were wrote
[1:03:48] in it everything you done under that
[1:03:52] nature so under that nature that that
[1:03:56] nature and that old name are identified
[1:04:00] in one book called The Book of Life now
[1:04:03] neither that nature nor that old name
[1:04:06] can be identified in the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:09] Life Now religion's good going to church
[1:04:13] is good helping people that's good but
[1:04:16] that's not what I'm talking about this
[1:04:18] morning there's only one thing that will
[1:04:22] eradicate that book now you see friend
[1:04:24] there's many people that are are going
[1:04:26] to church and they think because they
[1:04:28] join the church and they do good things
[1:04:30] that they're ready to meet the Lord
[1:04:32] Jesus and how surprised they're going to
[1:04:33] be when they stand before him and God
[1:04:36] doesn't open up the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:04:38] but God opens up the book of life and
[1:04:41] there is the record of all the Deeds
[1:04:43] they thought was taken care
[1:04:46] of and they're going to stand before God
[1:04:49] with all their adulteries all their lies
[1:04:52] all their fornications and all the
[1:04:54] things that they thought was absolutely
[1:04:57] blotted out because they accepted it by
[1:05:01] a church theology instead of a real
[1:05:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost you talking
[1:05:07] about surprised people at the Judgment
[1:05:10] now you remember whenever the prophet
[1:05:12] seen the woman in the restaurant in Ohio
[1:05:16] and she was dressed really really bad
[1:05:17] and the the state trooper was there and
[1:05:20] they was drinking and different things
[1:05:21] that was going on and he he condemned
[1:05:24] the woman and and his heart you remember
[1:05:27] that and he had this attitude toward him
[1:05:30] and I want you to notice how that he
[1:05:32] relates this to us oh how I thank God
[1:05:35] that he was able to give these things to
[1:05:37] us and didn't hide them so I thought yes
[1:05:39] and God would have destroyed me now what
[1:05:42] what happens to him is that the Lord
[1:05:44] begins to flash back to him his old life
[1:05:47] and his sins now then the Lord gives him
[1:05:50] a vision now I want you to notice the
[1:05:52] vision hadn't it been for the blood of
[1:05:55] Jesus Christ keeping my sins from his
[1:05:57] presence and then something come to me
[1:06:00] and said yes I forgive you but you want
[1:06:03] to condemn her and I thought God that's
[1:06:06] right that's right I seen my sins then
[1:06:10] one day I crawled up to him and I seen
[1:06:16] an old book right laying there it had
[1:06:20] William brandham at the top and all
[1:06:24] kinds of sin
[1:06:26] wrote Under it now watch what he's
[1:06:29] seeing by Vision he's seeing
[1:06:33] himself in book
[1:06:36] form he seeing hisself in book form so
[1:06:41] all of his sins all of his unbelief God
[1:06:45] is showing him oh my remember every one
[1:06:49] of us have a
[1:06:51] book every one of us have a book I hope
[1:06:56] today we've all got the first one
[1:06:58] destroyed oh my now notice what he sees
[1:07:03] I seen an old book lay there I had
[1:07:05] William brandom at the top of it all
[1:07:07] kinds of sins run I said Lord I'm so
[1:07:10] sorry that I've caused you all this
[1:07:12] bleeding and his face sweating and blood
[1:07:15] running down and I said I was the one
[1:07:17] who did that will you forgive
[1:07:21] me and he took his hand and dipped it in
[1:07:25] any
[1:07:27] side and wrote on that old
[1:07:31] book
[1:07:34] pardoned and throw it behind
[1:07:38] him in the sea of
[1:07:41] forgetfulness never to remember it
[1:07:45] against me no
[1:07:49] more praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:07:53] Lord he forgave me and I wanted to
[1:07:56] condemn
[1:07:58] her now notice what this done to him he
[1:08:01] said that changed my attitude so here
[1:08:05] the prophet tells us that his attitude
[1:08:08] toward this woman was wrong you'll agree
[1:08:11] to that so his attitude toward her was
[1:08:16] wrong so how is God going to deal with
[1:08:19] this now that the prophet has a wrong
[1:08:23] something that's displeasing to the Lord
[1:08:27] but yet he no longer has an old
[1:08:30] book so is the Lord going to go
[1:08:37] fishing and bring that old book back so
[1:08:41] he can write down in the old
[1:08:44] book his wrong
[1:08:47] attitude Oh Glory boy yall are quiet
[1:08:50] this
[1:08:51] morning so what's the Lord going to do
[1:08:54] you see once that that book is destroyed
[1:08:57] it can never be brought back to life
[1:09:00] again it is
[1:09:02] annihilated well brother Donnie what
[1:09:04] about it then when we do wrong look at
[1:09:06] this example so what did he do the
[1:09:09] spirit of God sent the corrective
[1:09:11] measure that would correct his attitude
[1:09:15] there's no need in writing it down he's
[1:09:18] going to make it right there's no need
[1:09:21] dragging that book back out and then
[1:09:23] rewriting it and then him saying I'm
[1:09:24] sorry and then he Blen it out you see
[1:09:27] once God changes our nature and that
[1:09:30] husband is dead it no longer controls
[1:09:33] you oh you say but don't we make
[1:09:35] mistakes we do and we fall short of the
[1:09:38] glory of God every day and we fix them
[1:09:41] every day come on somebody we're not
[1:09:44] waiting till the end of the week I don't
[1:09:46] know about you I ain't waiting till
[1:09:47] Wednesday night I might not live till
[1:09:49] Wednesday night if I've done anything
[1:09:51] wrong let me fix it right now Lord if I
[1:09:53] need to I'll fix it from the ppit
[1:09:56] but you see when God annihilates that
[1:09:58] old book that nature that name that
[1:10:01] husband notice the name that brother
[1:10:04] random saw it was not his new word
[1:10:08] name it was not his new word name it was
[1:10:12] his name that his mother and father gave
[1:10:16] him so when God now shows him what
[1:10:19] happened to him well you ought to be
[1:10:21] encouraged today because that didn't
[1:10:23] just happen to him it happened to every
[1:10:25] one of you that's got the Holy Ghost
[1:10:28] because as his old husband nature died
[1:10:33] and that book and that name and that
[1:10:36] nature the Trinity of the old man was
[1:10:39] all identified together and when death
[1:10:42] struck that the old nature which is your
[1:10:45] husband and your name and your book are
[1:10:49] all Chang
[1:10:50] forever I still know you by your name
[1:10:53] and you still know me by my name but God
[1:10:56] hallelujah knows Us by who we really
[1:11:00] really are now I know you understand
[1:11:03] this and one day whenever we gather
[1:11:04] beyond the curtain of time and we'll be
[1:11:06] joined together with the saints of God
[1:11:09] well all you know we've been been for a
[1:11:10] r Christian and most of us for many many
[1:11:12] years of our life we have enough sense
[1:11:14] to know that probably everybody in our
[1:11:16] family is not going to be there and we
[1:11:18] saying how in the world can I enjoy
[1:11:20] Heaven if so and so and there so and so
[1:11:23] is not there and so and so is not there
[1:11:25] you will be burst into your true family
[1:11:29] and it will be as if though you never
[1:11:32] lost anything because your aunt your
[1:11:35] uncle your grandmother whoever didn't
[1:11:37] make it because you would have come back
[1:11:40] to the true birst of the soul and your
[1:11:43] body theophany and soul will be merged
[1:11:47] together into the real family of God you
[1:11:51] say oh my my my child my this that the
[1:11:53] other no when you get there you will not
[1:11:56] have lost anything in your family
[1:12:01] tree well praise the Lord now notice so
[1:12:05] then his old book had been thrown away
[1:12:09] watch this now it wasn't so from the
[1:12:11] beginning every man's got to be born
[1:12:13] again and this sinful nature killed in
[1:12:17] him and a new man born in him which is
[1:12:22] Christ
[1:12:23] Jesus so it's not actually me being born
[1:12:27] in me and you being born in you it's not
[1:12:31] you it's not me it's Christ Jesus that
[1:12:36] is the new birth Lord of Mercy a new man
[1:12:42] born in him which is Christ Jesus the
[1:12:47] son of
[1:12:48] God Christ Jesus the son of God so the
[1:12:53] only begotten son of John John
[1:12:55] 3:16 becomes rebirthed again in other
[1:13:00] Sons and Daughters of God that are
[1:13:02] begotten in this last age it's the same
[1:13:05] Act of God as he's begetting one after
[1:13:09] another after another by the exact same
[1:13:13] process of the new birth I've got the
[1:13:16] same parent I've got the same experience
[1:13:19] I've got the same right that Simon Peter
[1:13:23] received on the day of Pentecost and you
[1:13:25] do too it's not just good for the
[1:13:28] apostles it's good for me it's good for
[1:13:31] our children it's good for you I don't
[1:13:33] care if you're poor if you're rich I
[1:13:35] don't care what race what ethen city you
[1:13:38] are if you want to receive it today and
[1:13:40] there's something inside you calling
[1:13:43] it's the same experience by the same God
[1:13:46] by the same baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:49] why would I want a handshake when I can
[1:13:51] receive the Lord Jesus and the Lord
[1:13:54] Jesus and be reborn in me that's what we
[1:13:58] want our children to have not just an
[1:14:02] all drye confession oh I believe Jesus
[1:14:05] died for my sins and died on the cross
[1:14:08] that's good but you want him to be
[1:14:10] reborn in your
[1:14:13] soul lord children can you imagine
[1:14:16] there's going to be preachers that's
[1:14:17] going to stand before him on that
[1:14:20] day and how surprised they're going to
[1:14:22] be when their book their old book yes
[1:14:26] sir is drawn out of the library of
[1:14:30] God they will stand there with their
[1:14:33] adulteries and their lying and their
[1:14:35] drinking spree and all this and that and
[1:14:37] the other though they may have preached
[1:14:38] for 50 years right amen because they
[1:14:42] were still married to a church
[1:14:44] husband which proves they're not married
[1:14:47] to
[1:14:49] Christ somebody said amen notice your
[1:14:53] old book
[1:14:55] is gone with your old
[1:15:00] Union what was your old book it was your
[1:15:05] marriage
[1:15:08] certificate that's it your old book was
[1:15:12] your marriage
[1:15:14] certificate now what do they do to us
[1:15:17] whenever we are born we get what is
[1:15:19] called a
[1:15:21] birth ah so it proves you were born
[1:15:25] says what state what day what hour what
[1:15:28] hospital or whatever more right so
[1:15:31] whenever you're doing certain
[1:15:32] documentation and things like that you
[1:15:34] have to have you're trying to get the
[1:15:36] real ID as they call it today Caren I
[1:15:38] just did a little bit ago they want
[1:15:40] proof of your citizenship they don't
[1:15:43] want you know just this that and the
[1:15:45] other CU anybody can do that but they
[1:15:47] want real proof they want
[1:15:50] authenticity that will be able to prove
[1:15:52] by your not just a driver's license they
[1:15:55] want a passport they want several proofs
[1:15:57] as far as your address they want a birth
[1:16:00] certificate because they want to make
[1:16:02] sure you are who you say you are don't
[1:16:07] you see it's real easy for anybody to
[1:16:09] say I'm a Christian but many of them do
[1:16:12] not have a new birth certificate which
[1:16:16] is their marriage certificate so well I
[1:16:20] join the church and I I believe God sent
[1:16:22] a prophet every devil in hell knows that
[1:16:24] but but that's still not your new
[1:16:27] marriage certificate your name must be
[1:16:31] transferred and your identity is no
[1:16:34] longer under the old nature oh God help
[1:16:37] us only now when we realize that it's
[1:16:40] beyond we can never do this it's
[1:16:43] impossible for any of us to do this
[1:16:45] that's why the new birth is such a
[1:16:48] supernatural
[1:16:51] Miracle oh my your name has been
[1:16:57] transferred yes sir do you mean to me
[1:16:59] that my old book God put it in the sea
[1:17:01] of his forgetfulness and you stand
[1:17:03] perfectly before God now your
[1:17:06] name is in the new book right not the
[1:17:11] book of
[1:17:12] life but the Lamb's Book of
[1:17:15] Life what the lamb redeemed not the old
[1:17:20] book of your natural Union but your new
[1:17:27] bride your new
[1:17:29] bride Hallelujah your new life is in the
[1:17:33] Lamb's Book of Life your marriage
[1:17:40] certificate your marriage certificate
[1:17:43] now you've seen that I've done many many
[1:17:45] weddings in different states and so on
[1:17:47] and the man who performs the ceremony it
[1:17:50] is my responsibility to be able to take
[1:17:53] that and to fill it out also I have to
[1:17:55] have a witness there they give their
[1:17:56] name their address and so on I have to
[1:17:58] specify was it a civil uh marriage or
[1:18:01] was it a religious one when did I do it
[1:18:04] where did I sign it so on and so on over
[1:18:06] and over and over again and then if I
[1:18:09] take it here I can either take it to the
[1:18:11] Washington County Courthouse Unico
[1:18:12] County Carter County and if I ask for it
[1:18:15] they will print me out the bride and the
[1:18:19] Grooms marriage certificate then I have
[1:18:22] the legal document now they go pick it
[1:18:24] up at the courthouse and they pay
[1:18:25] whatever it is to get it but they cannot
[1:18:28] put that up on their wall that expires
[1:18:30] within 30 days after the day at soned so
[1:18:33] no matter how much they say hey we went
[1:18:35] to the courthouse well that's where a
[1:18:37] lot of folks say well I went to the
[1:18:38] church house I went to the church house
[1:18:41] and I accepted John 3:16 and I walked up
[1:18:44] ear and I said I want to be married to
[1:18:45] Christ the word and right here's my
[1:18:47] scriptures John 3:16 Romans 5 I believe
[1:18:50] on him and I've confessed it with my
[1:18:52] mouth I've got it right here and the
[1:18:54] preacher said yeah glory to God you got
[1:18:55] her but you still got to be joined
[1:18:59] together so John do wants to marry Susie
[1:19:02] Jane and Susie Jane and John Doe ain't
[1:19:04] married legally until someone performs
[1:19:07] that ceremony and it ain't enough to
[1:19:09] just perform the ceremony but you got to
[1:19:12] be authorized to do it and then you've
[1:19:14] got to return it right back to them and
[1:19:17] then they will print it out to you and
[1:19:19] I've walked out of there with many of
[1:19:20] them in my hand and bring them to him at
[1:19:22] church or mail it to them whichever it
[1:19:24] is because then they are legally
[1:19:27] identified I don't want to just be
[1:19:30] emotionally identified with Christ I
[1:19:32] don't want to just cry a few tears about
[1:19:34] his blood I don't want to just cry a few
[1:19:37] tears about the cross I want to be
[1:19:39] legally identified I'll tell you what's

[1:24:38] justified you was
[1:24:41] accused but you never done
[1:24:44] it in the first
[1:24:48] place the old Union is in the sea of
[1:24:53] God's forgiveness fness you wasn't

[1:25:26] real Donnie rigan we're the real John
[1:25:29] Hornet but our problem is we look at

[1:25:34] careful we still live so much under the
[1:25:36] influence of that old name sure we're
[1:25:39] called by it every day of our life but
[1:25:41] one of these days you won't walk up to
[1:25:43] me in streets of gold and say hello
[1:25:45] brother Donnie and I won't say hello

[1:26:10] Like Jesus feet like Jesus a body like
[1:26:22] Jesus Oh Lord God
[1:26:26] Hallelujah
[1:26:29] absolutely out of
[1:26:32] existence even in the mind of
[1:26:39] God when brother Brandon was at Jack
[1:26:42] Moors in
[1:26:45] 1965 there was a sister that I know was
[1:26:48] there at those
[1:26:50] meetings she was
[1:26:52] a young woman
[1:26:56] she' been sneaking around
[1:26:58] sinning doing some things she shouldn't
[1:27:01] be
[1:27:02] doing had it hid from Mama had it hid
[1:27:05] from Daddy had it hid from the preacher
[1:27:07] other people but it just so happens she
[1:27:09] was sick so she got a prayer card to get
[1:27:12] in the prayer
[1:27:13] line she saw that discernment as it was
[1:27:16] going forth it scared the liver out of
[1:27:19] her and the devil too
[1:27:26] Hallelujah so she gets in the prayer
[1:27:28] line she's as nervous as she can be cuz
[1:27:31] she thinking oh Lord God he's going to
[1:27:34] call out what I've been doing mama's
[1:27:36] going to whoop me Daddy's going to whoop
[1:27:40] me she genuinely
[1:27:43] repents in the prayer line when she gets
[1:27:46] up before God's
[1:27:48] Prophet not one thing was mentioned
[1:27:51] about what she did wrong
[1:27:54] that distance between when she got in
[1:27:57] the prayer line before she stood before
[1:27:59] God's Gift God took care of every bit of
[1:28:02] it oh hallelujah how long does it take
[1:28:07] Brother Don however long it takes you to
[1:28:09] be sincere that's how long it takes can
[1:28:14] you imagine God so annihilated the
[1:28:17] prophet even goes on to say about that
[1:28:19] he said whenever you confess a sin he
[1:28:21] said God can't even show me about it oh
[1:28:24] oh Hallelujah God can't even show you
[1:28:26] but brother Donnie I remembered I know
[1:28:28] you do oh how lovely it would have been
[1:28:31] if the blood of the Lord Jesus would
[1:28:32] have painted my mind how it would have
[1:28:35] took away all my shortcomings and my
[1:28:37] failures but here I am in this state
[1:28:39] today that in my soul I've got a God's
[1:28:43] Soul I've got a soul that come from God
[1:28:46] a soul of God that was in God before the
[1:28:49] foundation of the world and yet I'm
[1:28:51] captured in this body of time I remember
[1:28:54] my shortcomings anybody else I remember
[1:28:57] my failures I remembered all I have
[1:28:59] mistakes and how I wish they was not
[1:29:02] there but I'm waiting for the
[1:29:04] finalization of the Court Document of my
[1:29:07] body change when my body's going to get
[1:29:10] the marriage
[1:29:13] [Applause]
[1:29:19] certificate you are The Virtuous bride
[1:29:22] of Christ
[1:29:24] washed in the blood of
[1:29:27] Christ
[1:29:28] precious
[1:29:30] virtuous
[1:29:32] sinless Son of
[1:29:35] God standing with a pure
[1:29:39] unadulterated bride
[1:29:45] word now it would be more common for us
[1:29:48] to flip it around which he did also at
[1:29:49] other times word
[1:29:52] bride but here
[1:29:54] is one of the Mysteries of the end time
[1:29:57] bride
[1:30:01] word cuz actually you were in his
[1:30:03] thinking before he ever had the word on
[1:30:08] print don't get mad at me now he ain't
[1:30:11] coming back for your Bible he's coming
[1:30:14] back for you he ain't coming back for
[1:30:17] your tapes and your tape players and
[1:30:18] your MP3 players right he's coming back
[1:30:22] for you so it's not just just word bride
[1:30:26] but it's bride
[1:30:28] word that he Washed by the Water of his
[1:30:31] own blood that
[1:30:33] became flesh and manifested that he
[1:30:36] might take
[1:30:38] you which were
[1:30:40] predestinated in the bosom of the
[1:30:44] father before the
[1:30:46] beginning the
[1:30:49] same Lord
[1:30:52] children the same same as he
[1:30:59] was than you Lord but you're
[1:31:02] haunted by your whole book than you Lord
[1:31:06] and because you're still captured in
[1:31:08] this Tabernacle of time right you go
[1:31:11] back and forth back and forth do I have
[1:31:14] the Holy Ghost don't I have the Holy
[1:31:15] Ghost do I have the Holy Ghost don't I
[1:31:17] have the Holy Ghost
[1:31:24] Lord God let me read that again that he
[1:31:28] might take you which were predestinated
[1:31:30] in the bosom of the father before the
[1:31:33] beginning the same as he was he was that
[1:31:37] great attribute of God Called
[1:31:41] Love notice then you're a Son of God in
[1:31:44] the house of God and you're a part of
[1:31:47] God's economy Romans 8:1 therefore no
[1:31:49] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:31:51] Jesus for they are dead to the world
[1:31:53] allive in him and living in the present
[1:31:55] day making the word that God has used
[1:31:59] them for for orain them placing their
[1:32:06] names in this bride
[1:32:09] book don't you see what the Lamb's Book
[1:32:12] of Life is The Book of Life contains the
[1:32:15] name of
[1:32:17] pharaoh The Book of Life contains the
[1:32:20] name of Adolf Heman Adolf h
[1:32:24] Pharaoh ramesis all the ones down
[1:32:28] through time many of those terrible
[1:32:30] terrible
[1:32:32] people is in the book of
[1:32:35] life but then the lamb had his own
[1:32:40] diary so the Book of Life contains a
[1:32:43] manifestation of billions of people that
[1:32:45] will live on the
[1:32:46] earth but the Lamb's Book is his own
[1:32:49] personal
[1:32:52] diary so he calls it bride
[1:32:56] book Oh Glory to God and when the waters
[1:33:01] comes upon that
[1:33:05] seed that's in your
[1:33:07] heart it raises it up to the bride of
[1:33:11] Christ oh my just perfect as it can be
[1:33:14] in every age it's been that way now let
[1:33:17] me remind you this is being preached in
[1:33:19] a Pentecostal Church which did not
[1:33:22] believe in predes
[1:33:25] destination matter of fact go to
[1:33:27] November what house you build for me in
[1:33:29] two R brother Brandon dedicates to place
[1:33:31] out that brother perig green was the
[1:33:33] beginning of his church you'll find
[1:33:35] brother Brandon before these meetings
[1:33:37] here mentioning about brother Jack Moore
[1:33:40] that he did not understand serpent seed
[1:33:42] election to the believer and he goes
[1:33:44] down through there listing many things
[1:33:47] that Brother Moore did not believe oh my
[1:33:50] I'm so glad we're sitting here in a
[1:33:51] church today that believes in election
[1:33:55] predestination for knowledge of God come
[1:33:57] on somebody that we believe they turned
[1:34:01] it down we accept it Hallelujah it is
[1:34:06] part of our
[1:34:13] identity now let's go into this part
[1:34:15] about the new
[1:34:19] nature if you believe in them little
[1:34:22] immoral things
[1:34:24] or just drop
[1:34:27] off as you
[1:34:30] believe you
[1:34:32] become
[1:34:35] love isn't that awesome I can say why
[1:34:39] the devil don't want this message
[1:34:40] preached can't
[1:34:43] you as you
[1:34:45] believe you become love so you're not
[1:34:50] just feeling love and experiencing love
[1:34:53] but if our faith does not produce this
[1:34:56] there's something wrong with our
[1:34:57] believing can you say Amen to that I
[1:35:00] don't want to just believe I I want to
[1:35:02] believe and become love oh
[1:35:07] Hallelujah and love is God and you begin
[1:35:10] to wind yourself into Christ now once
[1:35:14] you're believing becomes love then
[1:35:17] following your believing and your
[1:35:19] becoming comes
[1:35:22] winding your belie leing you're becoming
[1:35:25] and you're winding notice he doesn't say
[1:35:29] Christ is winding
[1:35:30] you but you are actually winding
[1:35:35] yourself into
[1:35:38] him why because it's him in you CHR
[1:35:43] don't you understand why people have a
[1:35:44] hard time living right don't you
[1:35:46] understand even why some of the
[1:35:46] preachers are on the message of backlit
[1:35:48] and left the word of God Hein never been
[1:35:50] born again they've never really had a
[1:35:53] word
[1:35:57] birst oh my notice he said then these
[1:36:01] other things you don't have to quit
[1:36:03] doing
[1:36:04] them they just quit themselves there's
[1:36:08] no desire to do it the worshipper having
[1:36:10] Purge has no more conscience or desire
[1:36:12] to sin Hebrews 9 the worshipper once
[1:36:14] purges see what I mean when the
[1:36:16] worshipper is purged is when he's born
[1:36:19] again when his old nature died eyes and
[1:36:25] a new nature sets in then he becomes a
[1:36:29] part of God a Son of
[1:36:33] God again in God's provided way
[1:36:36] conversion is the holy spirit that moves
[1:36:40] the old nature out and the new nature
[1:36:43] comes
[1:36:44] in which is the Holy Ghost don't you see
[1:36:48] what Satan is doing with theology he's
[1:36:50] trying to convince people the new birth
[1:36:53] in it's them it's them it's you being a
[1:36:56] better person it's you changing it's you
[1:36:58] it's you can't you see what he's trying
[1:37:00] to do he's trying to offer you this in
[1:37:02] the form of religion under the opes of
[1:37:05] what he's projecting as the cross that
[1:37:07] you become better and you become better
[1:37:09] don't you understand that's exactly what
[1:37:11] he done to Eve he's trying to offer her
[1:37:13] a godship without coming God's way it's
[1:37:16] much easier for you and I if we can just
[1:37:19] let the Lord Jesus do it instead of us
[1:37:22] struggling and find I I've got to do
[1:37:24] this and I I've got to do that the best
[1:37:26] thing you can do is give up come on
[1:37:30] somebody just give and Let Jesus take
[1:37:34] over Oh Brother Don I can't quit this
[1:37:36] and I can't quit that but Jesus can I I
[1:37:40] whole grudges I can't quit it but Jesus
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:50] can again he says if you want to be a
[1:37:52] Christian just ask ask
[1:37:54] Christ he will take your old nature
[1:37:58] out and put a new nature in then you
[1:38:01] don't have to impersonate
[1:38:03] anything you're just living a normal
[1:38:06] life that you're
[1:38:08] living well glory to God hallelujah it's
[1:38:12] just as easy for a holy ghost filled
[1:38:14] child of God to live a Christian Life is
[1:38:16] a drunk out here the live the life of a
[1:38:18] drunk or a harot to live the life of a
[1:38:20] harlot or a prostitute or whatever more
[1:38:22] drug addict they get up every day and
[1:38:24] they know they've got to have their
[1:38:26] drugs it's a life they live a holy ghost
[1:38:28] filed child of God Brother D don't they
[1:38:30] have battles they've got more than these
[1:38:32] people out here would even understand
[1:38:34] come on somebody but it ain't them on
[1:38:36] the inside it ain't the preacher on the
[1:38:39] inside it's Jesus on the inside
[1:38:42] Hallelujah and Jesus overcomes lying
[1:38:45] Jesus overcomes every sin out there
[1:38:48] because greater is he that is in us than
[1:38:50] he that is in the world
[1:38:52] [Applause]
[1:39:03] your old
[1:39:05] nature
[1:39:07] died yes sir the nature of the world and
[1:39:10] you become a new
[1:39:11] creation and your
[1:39:14] desires that old life that had a
[1:39:17] beginning when God breathed the breath
[1:39:20] into your
[1:39:21] nostrils when you were
[1:39:26] born so look at our stage of Innocence
[1:39:29] as we would think and when we took the
[1:39:32] breath of life and God breathed into our
[1:39:34] nostrils our old nature which was her
[1:39:38] husband moved
[1:39:42] in now you're

[1:39:47] while cuz you're a
[1:39:48] baby but you wait till I get a hold to

[1:40:17] am ain't that what we done whatever he
[1:40:20] wanted to do we did it some of y'all
[1:40:23] think it's crazy the way I stand up here
[1:40:24] and preach and run and shout and sweat
[1:40:26] and spit and carry on and you think that
[1:40:28] is absolutely absurd I'll tell you
[1:40:29] what's absolutely absurd people going in
[1:40:32] and sitting you're not long ago to the
[1:40:33] Super Bowl playoff and them different
[1:40:35] things and some of them still having
[1:40:36] their fingers and toes took off because
[1:40:38] it got so cold they got frostbit and you
[1:40:41] life at me and make make fun of some of
[1:40:43] the rest of the holy rollers around this
[1:40:45] message because we want to worship God
[1:40:47] and people would give up a toe or a
[1:40:49] finger for some stupid ball game
[1:40:51] somewhere and we come to the House of
[1:40:53] God and set there like a bump on a
[1:40:55] pickle we won't even raise our hands and
[1:40:57] praise God we won't even Shout to the
[1:41:00] Lord and yet they give their toes they
[1:41:02] give their fingers some of them lost the
[1:41:05] tips of their noses for a ball game for
[1:41:09] a ball game I'm talking about the
[1:41:11] resurrection and the life I'm talking
[1:41:14] about salvation I'm talking about a body
[1:41:18] change
[1:41:30] [Applause]
[1:41:38] notice this you must be born again a new
[1:41:40] nature a new being New
[1:41:44] Creation nature of your father and you
[1:41:46] believe and love every word that he said
[1:41:51] every man's word is a lie
[1:41:55] contrary to this word now here's our
[1:41:59] problem right here this next
[1:42:01] paragraph now if you've got a Church
[1:42:06] Father you'll believe in that church
[1:42:11] father that's why some preachers can get
[1:42:13] up and preach things that's contrary to
[1:42:15] the scripture and the messages they can
[1:42:17] be and you can show people and they'll
[1:42:19] still sit right
[1:42:21] there come on
[1:42:25] well that's what my church says that's
[1:42:26] what my daddy said that's what my
[1:42:27] grandma said you've got a Church
[1:42:30] Father well come on
[1:42:33] somebody uhhuh you've got a Church
[1:42:35] Father you'll believe in that church
[1:42:37] father but if you god father God you'll
[1:42:42] believe in God's word if you've got a
[1:42:46] father in the church you'll believe that
[1:42:49] because you're of his nature
[1:42:53] can't you see a lot of these moves
[1:42:55] that's been down through time look at
[1:42:57] all the moves that come through our
[1:42:58] message what do they do they take on the
[1:43:00] nature of the founder come on somebody
[1:43:04] well brother so and so said brother so
[1:43:06] and so said brother so and so said I
[1:43:08] don't care what brother so and so said
[1:43:10] if it's contrary to God's word let
[1:43:13] brother so and so and every other so and
[1:43:15] so be a liar but let God's word be the
[1:43:21] truth but people take on on the nature
[1:43:23] of a church father or me said it this
[1:43:26] way their
[1:43:31] Pastor well that's well and good as long
[1:43:33] as your pastor's telling the truth God's
[1:43:35] Prophet also told you if that Pastor
[1:43:37] leaves the word you leave him that goes
[1:43:40] for me and every other Pastor well I've
[1:43:43] been sitting on him for 20 years I don't
[1:43:44] care if you've been sitting on 375 years
[1:43:46] if he leaves a word you better leave him
[1:43:48] you're going to be lost if you
[1:43:51] don't woo
[1:43:54] wow oh my if you're the church you'll
[1:43:57] believe his word you'll believe the
[1:43:59] church word if you believe what the
[1:44:01] church said but if you're born again
[1:44:02] you'll believe what God says cuz God's
[1:44:05] your
[1:44:06] father not the world or the church
[1:44:11] creates I found this yesterday was I was
[1:44:14] studying before
[1:44:16] service I just had to pull my laptop
[1:44:19] away just a bit and just sit there and
[1:44:21] just contemplate it
[1:44:23] and shake my head we are Christians by
[1:44:27] birth that makes us new
[1:44:30] creatures in our old
[1:44:35] nature we could
[1:44:38] never be
[1:44:41] Christians don't you see what Satan
[1:44:44] wants to do to
[1:44:46] people convince them they're
[1:44:49] Christians in their old nature
[1:44:57] so they go to school they go to Sunday
[1:44:58] school they go to learning classes and
[1:45:00] they go here and they go there and
[1:45:01] they're you know they're learning how to
[1:45:03] be a Christian and they're learning how
[1:45:04] to do this how to change from coming out
[1:45:06] of the world you know uh the books for a
[1:45:09] for how to become a real believer and
[1:45:11] how to overcome in this day your life
[1:45:13] you know what you can be in all this
[1:45:15] life what are they trying to do
[1:45:17] introduce Christianity into their own
[1:45:20] nature and it's an impossibility we can
[1:45:22] never be a
[1:45:24] Christian in our own
[1:45:27] nature and that's where the majority of
[1:45:29] the world is today my
[1:45:34] friends that's why when the Rapture
[1:45:36] takes place there'll be so
[1:45:40] few the world will go right
[1:45:43] on the sad part about it is there'll be
[1:45:45] some message people that'll go right on
[1:45:48] because we've got them same type of
[1:45:49] people in our churches they're trying to
[1:45:52] become
[1:45:53] Christians in their own
[1:45:56] nature that's the reason today we have
[1:45:58] so many calling themselves Christians
[1:46:00] and living any kind of a
[1:46:03] life they've never experienced that born
[1:46:05] again that's something that changes you
[1:46:08] that takes the life out like pulling the
[1:46:11] blood out of a man that's got a certain
[1:46:13] type of blood and putting another type
[1:46:16] in him it's pulling the old life out of
[1:46:19] the
[1:46:20] man and injecting
[1:46:25] The Life of Christ in The
[1:46:32] Believer so God takes the old life out
[1:46:36] and injects
[1:46:37] himself this is what he had to do to
[1:46:40] become a son put himself in a
[1:46:42] dispensable
[1:46:44] form a dispensable form by which God the
[1:46:49] great Eternal could not ever do this but
[1:46:52] when God become a man tore open the
[1:46:55] human body released the token
[1:46:58] life God made himself where he could
[1:47:01] divide
[1:47:02] himself so here was this great Eternal
[1:47:05] the Fountain of all Purity and wisdom
[1:47:06] and Holiness and righteousness but God
[1:47:09] wanted a
[1:47:11] subdivision yeah now you might own 500
[1:47:14] acres and you say well I want this 500
[1:47:16] Acres but I want a subdivision both you
[1:47:18] can't have both of them if you want a
[1:47:21] subdivision you're going to have to
[1:47:23] subdivide your property you're going to
[1:47:25] have to put roads in there you're going
[1:47:27] to put water you're going to have to put
[1:47:27] setic system you're going to have to do
[1:47:29] all that sort of thing and God wanted a
[1:47:32] Divine subdivision because he's got a
[1:47:34] great big city planted up in heaven for
[1:47:36] all the inhabitants of the subdivision
[1:47:38] so God had to divide himself but how can
[1:47:41] you divide the Eternal so he started
[1:47:44] within the beginning was the word so he
[1:47:47] started there and from the division of
[1:47:50] the word separating it from himself he
[1:47:53] could start in a dispensable form and he
[1:47:55] comes on down to the breaking of the Old
[1:47:58] Testament leading into the new and he
[1:48:00] would put himself in a blood cell and
[1:48:02] when that blood cell was broke up the
[1:48:04] calvary it released the spirit of God
[1:48:07] and here they come up on the day of
[1:48:08] Pentecost and they're just sitting in
[1:48:10] there well glory to God hallelujah we're
[1:48:12] going to preach this gospel a't we
[1:48:14] Brothers I'll tell you one thing we're
[1:48:15] not sure why we're in here for Jesus
[1:48:17] told us to come and we're just sitting
[1:48:19] here waiting and maybe we're getting all
[1:48:20] of our quotes together and stuff like
[1:48:22] that and we're going to go out of here
[1:48:23] man we're going to bring people to Jesus
[1:48:26] and all of a sudden here come the big D9
[1:48:32] Dozer and he started dividing
[1:48:35] himself here hung that Pillar of
[1:48:38] Fire and he
[1:48:46] went the subdivision
[1:48:49] started well let me tell you something
[1:48:51] it's still going on
[1:48:53] today but it ain't going to be long all
[1:48:56] the property is going to be inhabited by
[1:48:58] all those who had their title deed
[1:49:01] before the foundation of the world and
[1:49:03] all these lots are all these lots are
[1:49:07] going to be occupied and then it's going
[1:49:09] to be a great big Gathering Place and
[1:49:11] the father's going to move us up to his
[1:49:13] house and we're all going to live in a
[1:49:16] gated community
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:23] hallelujah hallelujah I'll tell you what
[1:49:27] kind of gates they are Gates of
[1:49:31] pearl you see those who never got
[1:49:33] attracted of the father's inheritance
[1:49:36] even in the new city live on the
[1:49:41] outside only the partakers of the deeded
[1:49:44] warranty of God live in the
[1:49:50] city oh my Lord
[1:49:53] you see to be married to that old nature
[1:49:55] and try to be a
[1:49:56] Christian you'll never have
[1:49:59] peace constant
[1:50:02] struggle watch the way the prophet deals
[1:50:04] with this he said talking about the
[1:50:07] church she can't be married to a
[1:50:10] denomination and be the bride of Christ
[1:50:12] at the same time amen she's got to be
[1:50:15] dead one to the
[1:50:16] other the law says so here plenty of
[1:50:19] laws in God's word that's his law Paul's
[1:50:21] speaking the same thing she cannot be a
[1:50:23] married to a church a worldly
[1:50:26] Creed and be the bride of Christ because
[1:50:30] one is contrary that's right to the
[1:50:33] other yes well we believe this but we
[1:50:36] don't believe that ah you see that same
[1:50:38] things right in the
[1:50:40] message well we believe he was inspired
[1:50:43] here yeah we we take this part here but
[1:50:47] what if that part you're leaving out was
[1:50:49] just as inspired as the part you think
[1:50:50] was inspired
[1:50:53] now she is a woman if she's married to
[1:50:55] Christ the word she cannot be married to
[1:50:56] a church denomination at the same time
[1:50:59] so this concept to people have been able
[1:51:01] to remain their denominational identity
[1:51:03] and be the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:51:05] contrary to the word of God and contrary
[1:51:07] to the message of the
[1:51:10] hour oh but you see the issue is people
[1:51:13] are going to stick with their Church
[1:51:16] Father
[1:51:18] sir well my my uncle says my my grandpa
[1:51:22] my my pastor says if your pastor don't
[1:51:24] say this he's saying contrary to what
[1:51:27] God's Prophet
[1:51:28] Said Amen brother Donnie preach brother
[1:51:30] Donnie we're behind you brother
[1:51:35] Donnie notice she cannot live with both
[1:51:37] husbands at the same time they're
[1:51:39] contrary one to the other one is God
[1:51:42] sent and the other one is
[1:51:46] man-made you can't be a virtuous Bible
[1:51:50] believing Christian
[1:51:54] and Associate
[1:51:56] yourself and the
[1:51:59] denominational
[1:52:02] Affair so you see what they're having
[1:52:05] they're having an
[1:52:07] affair on
[1:52:11] Jesus well I'm a secret believer I
[1:52:15] maintain you know my my my my secrecy
[1:52:18] you know I I I believe it but I it be be
[1:52:21] a lot of reproach if I went up to the
[1:52:22] word of life and went up there and was
[1:52:24] identified there everybody knows what
[1:52:26] brother Donnie believes he's so stupid
[1:52:28] he just opens his mouth and tells
[1:52:29] everybody he tells the world and YouTube
[1:52:32] and everybody else yeah I do I just tell
[1:52:34] them I ain't got no secret code and we
[1:52:36] don't you don't do no hand signs and we
[1:52:38] believe the what I believe you can
[1:52:40] search our website and find it out I
[1:52:42] ain't like some of these politician
[1:52:43] preachers in the message that believe
[1:52:45] this and this and this but nobody knows
[1:52:46] it except those in the back office no if
[1:52:49] I believe in water baptism in the name
[1:52:51] of the Lord Jesus I'm going to bury him
[1:52:53] up here in his name if I believe you
[1:52:55] can't smoke if I believe you can't drink
[1:52:57] I believe you can't run around I ain't
[1:52:59] going to hold it back but Brother Don we
[1:53:00] got new people coming this may be the
[1:53:02] very thing they need to hear why should

[2:04:03] hit them and all of a sudden they'll
[2:04:05] they'll find this magic scripture magic
[2:04:08] quote but help them to realize it's
[2:04:12] impossible for us to be a word born
[2:04:15] Christian in our old
[2:04:19] nature but we must bring our nature to
[2:04:22] The
[2:04:23] Altar and the wrath of
[2:04:27] God will fall upon that nature and
[2:04:30] annihilate
[2:04:32] it and then the book the name and the
[2:04:38] nature the Trinity of our old
[2:04:41] self is cast into the
[2:04:44] sea of God's
[2:04:48] forgetfulness and we raise from that
[2:04:50] place man woman boy or
[2:04:53] girl with the Lord

[2:05:18] neither whether that would be our
[2:05:20] grandfather or Uncle our cousin whoever
[2:05:23] our favorite preacher we must be
[2:05:26] begotten by the
[2:05:28] word we want you to be our father and if
[2:05:33] you're our father we'll believe every
[2:05:35] word cuz that's who we are
[2:05:39] amen oh we worship you
[2:05:43] Jesus we worship you

[2:05:54] many weddings and whenever the preacher
[2:05:57] makes the pronouncement and they the
[2:06:01] bride reaches over and gets her
[2:06:04] flowers and there they stand all
[2:06:07] smiles and they head down that middle
[2:06:10] aisle and the song starts
[2:06:13] playing and either people clap their
[2:06:15] hands or whatever it is that they're
[2:06:18] doing
[2:06:19] oh what Joy
[2:06:23] what Joy
[2:06:24] what plans have been made and all the
[2:06:27] arrangements have been put
[2:06:29] forth you imagine when Christ Jesus
[2:06:32] raptures his
[2:06:35] bride the angels of God were
[2:06:38] taught that by
[2:06:42] 1965 remember in that new city not one
[2:06:46] Fallen Angel has never set one foot
[2:06:51] Satan has actually walked Before the
[2:06:54] Throne of
[2:06:56] God he's there
[2:06:59] today so Jesus said I'm going away to
[2:07:02] prepare a place for
[2:07:04] you for a couple of thousand years he's
[2:07:08] been there creating walls and
[2:07:12] Gates you imagine a pearl that is 20
[2:07:16] some feet
[2:07:18] tall the wall is 216 ft
[2:07:23] tall
[2:07:24] Chow Sapphire
[2:07:27] amethyst Burl
[2:07:31] onx but by
[2:07:34] 1965 the walls had already been hung
[2:07:38] laid the gates had been hung and the
[2:07:41] streets had already been paved you'll
[2:07:44] find this in the church age
[2:07:47] book so if the city was just about done
[2:07:50] in 1965
[2:07:52] think where we are today in
[2:07:55] 2024 and the prophet said that the
[2:07:58] angels are already there in the city and
[2:08:01] they're waiting
[2:08:09] breathlessly for
[2:08:11] what for what more
[2:08:15] gold more
[2:08:17] pearls
[2:08:19] you amen
[2:08:23] angels of God waiting
[2:08:26] breathlessly as they're waiting for the
[2:08:29] inhabitants as brother Daryl spoke last
[2:08:31] night about the city not just the city
[2:08:34] itself it's the people who make it
[2:08:37] up so since
[2:08:40] 1965 they've been just tidying up and
[2:08:43] getting things ready and it amazing that
[2:08:46] the city reached his state of completion
[2:08:52] two
[2:08:53] years after the Sails are
[2:08:58] open how come it wasn't two years after
[2:09:00] the
[2:09:02] cross how come it wasn't two years after
[2:09:04] the Holy Ghost fell at
[2:09:06] Pentecost once the seals come open it's
[2:09:09] so far it'll never turn back it'll never
[2:09:13] be stopped so he said I'm going to go
[2:09:14] ahead and finish
[2:09:17] it I'm just going to go ahead and finish
[2:09:19] it don't you want to go sh
[2:09:24] just make
[2:09:26] sure just make sure you're not trying to
[2:09:28] be a

[2:10:29] ago about their son under a rebellious
[2:10:31] time in their life and talking about
[2:10:32] going to a certain certain Church said
