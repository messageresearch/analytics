[15:54] There's a kind of thing that breaks a

[16:04] breaks him down to
[16:07] his knees.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; I've been broken more than the time of
[16:17] Jes.
[16:21] Then he pick me up
[16:24] and show me what it means to be a man.
[16:28] That's why I sing that song.

[17:10] Hallelujah. Give the Lord one more good
[17:12] hand as you're seated today. Praise the
[17:14] Lord.
[17:16] We got actually got four songs this
[17:18] morning. We're going to be able to work
[17:19] daily in. And I do believe Brother
[17:20] Jordan, Brother Paul, Sister Harry,
[17:23] Brother Phillip, and the trio. Now, this
[17:25] is their last service for with with us
[17:28] for a little while, but probably Brother
[17:31] Phillip and the trio don't know. We may
[17:35] just go ahead and fill out adoption
[17:36] papers on you. Just keep them. Would you
[17:39] like to just keep them?
[17:41] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Philip. Amen.
[17:43] Certainly appreciate those folks.
[17:44] They've been a blessing to us while
[17:46] they've been here. Give our singers a
[17:48] real good hand this morning if you will.
[18:05] When life lets you down and you feel
[18:09] more broken than whole.
[18:15] When the wounds go deeper than words
[18:20] and you can't tell a soul.
[18:26] I may not know what you're going
[18:30] through.
[18:32] May not can make that high mountain
[18:35] move.
[18:37] But one thing I found that I really want
[18:41] you to know,
[18:47] if it matters to you,
[18:52] it matters to the master.
[18:57] He wants to share
[19:00] the burdens you bear.
[19:03] Whisper peace when your world gets
[19:07] shattered.
[19:09] If it's your greatest joy or your
[19:13] deepest pain
[19:15] or you're really needing an answer,
[19:20] if it matters to you,
[19:25] it matters to the master.
[19:37] Friend, do you think the maker and giver
[19:42] of life
[19:47] is far too busy to care
[19:52] about your trouble and strife?
[19:58] He sees the sparrow that falls to the
[20:02] ground and hears the tears that don't
[20:06] make a sound. If you only knew how
[20:11] precious you are inside.
[20:18] If it matters to you,
[20:22] it matters to the master.
[20:28] He wants to share the burdens you bear.
[20:33] Whisper peace when your world needs
[20:36] shatter.
[20:38] If it's your biggest joy or your deepest
[20:43] pain or you're really needing an answer,
[20:49] if it matters to you,
[20:53] it matters to the master.
[21:00] Joy is joy or your deepest pain or
[21:05] you're really needing an answer.
[21:09] If it matters to you,
[21:14] it doesn't only matter to you.
[21:19] If it matters to you,
[21:24] it matters to the master.
[21:28] Yeah.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful?
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you may think you're so small,
[21:57] but his eyes on the sparrow. He's
[22:00] definitely his eyes are on us. We all
[22:02] know this song. And I was trying to
[22:04] think of a song to sing this morning.
[22:06] And after I heard about Sister Janet, I
[22:08] was like, you know what? We're all
[22:09] longing for B land.
[22:13] So y'all just sing it with me.
[22:22] I'm kind of whole
[22:28] sick for
[22:31] that country
[22:36] to which I've never
[22:43] been before.
[22:49] No sad goodbye
[22:56] will there be spoken
[23:03] for time won't matter
[23:11] anymore.
[23:13] Oh,
[23:18] you
[23:26] longing
[23:27] for
[23:29] you.
[23:33] And someday
[23:39] someday
[23:41] I'll stand
[23:49] where my home
[23:55] shall be.
[24:02] Oh, you
[24:09] sweet.
[24:17] I'm looking
[24:19] now
[24:24] across
[24:26] that river
[24:31] to where my faith
[24:38] will end inside.
[24:45] There's just a few
[24:52] more days
[24:54] to labor
[24:59] and then I'll take
[25:06] my heaven.
[25:20] I'm longing
[25:23] for
[25:24] you.
[25:28] And someday
[25:34] only
[25:36] I'll stand
[25:42] where my heart
[25:48] shall be
[25:51] true.
[25:56] You
[26:02] sweep you
[26:05] away.
[26:07] Second verse again.
[26:09] I'm looking
[26:11] now
[26:16] across
[26:18] that river
[26:23] to where my faith
[26:30] will end inside.
[26:37] There's just a few
[26:44] more days to labor
[26:51] and then I'll take
[26:58] my heavenly
[27:00] father.
[27:05] Oh, you
[27:11] I
[27:14] for
[27:16] you.
[27:19] And someday
[27:25] holy
[27:27] I'll stand
[27:33] where my heart
[27:39] shall be
[27:42] to
[27:48] You
[27:53] sweet new
[28:27] Certainly longing for that day we all be
[28:30] together. No more pain, no more
[28:32] sickness, no more sorrow.
[28:34] Just together for eternity. Amen. just
[28:36] want to say it's been such a blessing
[28:39] for us to have been here and worship the
[28:42] Lord together and we appreciate all that
[28:45] um the hospitality and we just continue
[28:49] to pray for you all and that God will
[28:52] continue to use you for his honor and
[28:54] his glory. Amen. Thank you. God bless
[28:55] you.
[29:21] He promised us that he would be a
[29:26] counelor,
[29:29] a mighty God
[29:32] and the prince of peace.
[29:38] He promised us that he would be our
[29:43] father
[29:46] and that he would love us with a love
[29:50] that would not cease.
[29:55] Well, I tried him and I found his
[29:59] promises
[30:01] are true.
[30:04] He is everything
[30:06] he said that he would be.
[30:12] kindest words I know could not begin to
[30:18] tell
[30:20] just what
[30:22] Jesus really means to me.
[30:29] for he's
[30:31] more
[30:34] wonderful
[30:38] in my life
[30:40] and conceive
[30:42] is more wonderful
[30:47] in my heart.
[30:51] He holds me.
[30:55] My is
[31:10] everything
[31:12] that my soul
[31:15] ever long for.
[31:18] Everything he's promised
[31:21] has so
[31:23] much more. More than amazing,
[31:30] more
[31:34] than
[31:38] could ever be.
[31:41] He's more than wonderful.
[31:47] That's what Jesus
[31:50] is
[31:52] to me.
[32:00] I stand amazed to think the King of
[32:05] glory
[32:08] would come to live within the heart of
[32:13] man.
[32:17] I marvel just to know he really loves
[32:23] me
[32:25] when I think of who he is and who I am.
[32:34] For he's
[32:36] more
[32:39] wonderful
[32:42] when my mind
[32:44] can see. He's more wonderful.
[32:51] My heart
[32:53] can see. He goes beyond.

[33:24] pro
[33:29] more than amazing,
[33:34] more than marvelous,
[33:37] more
[33:42] could be.
[33:45] He's more than wonderful.
[33:50] That's what Jesus
[33:53] is to me.
[34:01] for
[34:06] wonderful
[34:10] my
[34:14] wonderful
[34:18] my heart
[34:20] can believe he goes beyond
[34:25] my I
[34:31] dream
[34:38] everything
[34:42] that my soul
[34:48] everything is pro
[34:51] and so
[34:55] Whatever crazy
[35:07] will ever be.
[35:10] He's more than wonderful.
[35:15] That's what Jesus
[35:19] is
[35:20] to me.
[35:40] Amen.
[35:48] Hallelujah.
[36:11] You
[36:50] Heat. Heat.
[37:12] Heat.
[37:19] Heat.
[37:35] Heat. Heat.
[37:59] Heat. Heat.
[38:07] Heat. Heat.
[38:27] Heat. Heat.
[38:50] Heat.
[39:06] Heat.
[39:13] Heat. Heat.
[39:36] Heat. Heat.
[40:12] Heat. Heat.
[40:30] Heat. Heat.
[40:40] Heat. Heat.
[41:18] It's amazing to me
[41:21] now that music
[41:23] is written in harmony.
[41:25] And
[41:27] if we could make our lives so harmonized
[41:32] as musicians can do. Some of his
[41:35] brothers practiced together, but the
[41:37] most of the rest of us didn't practice
[41:39] together.
[41:40] We didn't know what chords they was
[41:42] doing, what songs they were doing. But
[41:44] because we were musicians and talented
[41:47] in our own way, were able to harmonize
[41:50] together. Wouldn't have been sympathy
[41:51] playing one song, Harry's playing
[41:53] another one, and I was playing another
[41:54] one.
[41:56] But it's so sad. That's the way a lot of
[41:58] folks do in life. God's got the sheet
[42:01] music out in front of us and he just
[42:03] wants each of us to get on our part and
[42:06] we're all playing the same song.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; I just told you who's going in the
[42:11] rapture.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[42:14] &gt;&gt; many folks miss it. They miss the music
[42:16] sheet. They miss it and they think,
[42:18] "Well, I think we ought to be playing
[42:19] this." And somebody said, "That ain't
[42:20] what we're playing. It's the wrong time
[42:22] for that. Noah played that.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "No, we ought to be
[42:26] playing this." And said, Somebody said,
[42:28] "No, that's the wrong one. Moses already
[42:30] played that part."
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Well, we should be doing what Luther
[42:33] said. No, we've done move beyond into
[42:36] that part. And then some say, "Well,
[42:38] glory to God. We got to have a move of
[42:40] God among us. We got to repeat
[42:42] Pentecost."
[42:43] But I hear the prophets say, "No, it's
[42:46] don't mix up with Pentecostalism."
[42:49] Now, we want true Pentecost,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; but I don't want that ism
[42:54] &gt;&gt; because that ism is a wisdom.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; It's not current.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; If every one of us can find our lives on
[43:02] the music sheet and play right out
[43:05] &gt;&gt; and it will happen.
[43:08] I don't know that I'll ever forget it,
[43:09] but the Lord gave me a sermon many years
[43:11] ago and one of the places I preached it,
[43:14] Brother Dave Swanson, uh was there, I
[43:17] think in Edmonton at a convention that
[43:18] we had, and u it was a divine symphony
[43:22] and I was back in a room. It was an
[43:24] auditorium type thing and and I went to
[43:26] pilfering through the closets there and
[43:28] I found a a wooden hanger. So whenever I
[43:32] stepped out to the pulpit, had my Bible,
[43:34] but also had this piece of a wooden
[43:36] hanger. So, I
[43:39] tapped on the desk
[43:42] and started like I knew what I was
[43:44] doing.
[43:46] I really didn't, but they thought I did.
[43:50] But I'll tell you one thing. Whenever it
[43:51] comes to the spirit of God, we sure want
[43:53] to know what we're playing, don't we?
[43:55] &gt;&gt; We greet you today. Isn't it wonderful
[43:57] to be in the house for the Lord?
[43:59] &gt;&gt; I want to thank all these singers,
[44:01] special musicians, and stuff. It was
[44:02] such a blessing to us. Let's turn, if
[44:05] you would, to second Peter today.
[44:06] Chapter 1. Also, Caroline, I want to
[44:09] thank you all for your nice Christmas
[44:12] cards and gift cards and all those
[44:14] things that you sent. Some people sent
[44:16] fruit for us and different things that
[44:19] you did. We want you to know we
[44:20] appreciate that with all of our hearts.
[44:22] May the Lord bless you. All them cards
[44:25] with your family photos on them. Carol
[44:27] gets them and puts them in a file. And u
[44:30] we've been noticing though that y'all
[44:32] have been getting older from each year,
[44:34] one year to another. And she and I are
[44:37] trying to figure out how is everybody in
[44:38] the church getting older but us.
[44:41] I mean, we're just we're feeling so
[44:43] sorry for you all that it's
[44:46] Well, they say age is just a number, I
[44:48] guess, ain't it, Brother Phillip? That's
[44:50] what they say. So, but we're 69 or 59 or
[44:55] 49 or whatever you are going on 18.
[44:58] Yeah,
[44:59] &gt;&gt; science can't do that, but our heavenly
[45:01] father can.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's uh read together
[45:06] today. Grace and peace be multiplied
[45:09] unto you through the knowledge of God
[45:11] and of Jesus our Lord. according as his
[45:14] divine power hath given unto us all
[45:16] things that pertain unto life and
[45:19] godliness. Through the knowledge of him
[45:21] that has called us to glory and virtue,
[45:24] whereby given unto us exceeding great
[45:27] and precious promises, that by these you
[45:30] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[45:34] having escaped the corruption that is in
[45:36] the world through lust. And beside this,
[45:40] giving all diligence, add to your faith
[45:42] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[45:45] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[45:47] patience, and to patience godliness,
[45:51] and to godliness,
[45:54] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[45:56] kindness, charity.
[45:59] How many would like to be remembered
[46:01] today as we pray?
[46:04] Heavenly Father, as we
[46:07] count it such a privilege that we can be
[46:09] gathered together again in this place
[46:11] that you've given us, Lord,
[46:14] dear God, we never want our church to be
[46:17] a memorial of what you used to do. We
[46:22] never want it to be a place to where we
[46:24] just have form and fashion and ritual,
[46:27] but we always want your presence to be
[46:30] here.
[46:32] For Lord, form won't heal the sick.
[46:34] Fashion won't change people's lives.
[46:38] Even Even just reading the scripture
[46:40] itself won't do it unless it's
[46:42] quickened. So, we're needing you today,
[46:45] Father. You saw the hundreds of hands
[46:47] that were uplifted. You knew the need
[46:49] that was signified as they raised their
[46:51] hand. You knew it before the foundation
[46:53] of the world. And we're just praying
[46:55] today for each of them. Lord, I pray
[46:57] that you'd help me. No doubt I'm the
[46:59] most needy person in the building.
[47:02] to have to stand before these people
[47:04] today and bring something that will help
[47:06] them. Only you can custom fit a sermon
[47:10] that would be able to meet every need of
[47:12] every hungry heart. Help me, Lord God,
[47:15] to get out of the way. Shut my mouth to
[47:17] anything that would displease you. Lord,
[47:19] help me to follow your leading. Lord,
[47:22] you see this prayer cost I have in my
[47:23] hand today. And I pray that you'd be
[47:25] mindful of this need. Lord, we also just
[47:28] want to mention our sister Janet Payne
[47:30] today. Father, you see her her son and
[47:34] all that they've been through this week.
[47:36] And Lord, than him passing this morning
[47:39] and that our sister Janet wanted to be
[47:41] in church, she wanted to be here with us
[47:44] today. And we just pray that you'd
[47:45] strengthen our sister just from hearing
[47:48] what you've done for her son this week.
[47:50] We are so grateful. Once again, we see
[47:54] the hand of God in mercy. You want
[47:58] people to be saved so bad. And the
[48:02] scripture tells us, "It's not your will
[48:05] that any should perish." May we feel the
[48:08] same way about the lost, Lord. May we
[48:11] not draw lines and cut people in and cut
[48:14] others out. May our hearts be open, dear
[48:17] God, that you can save the lost. Some
[48:19] may never be bride, but they'll be saved
[48:22] to have eternal life. What is that
[48:25] worth? Help us our prayer today, Father,
[48:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the
[48:30] saints said,
[48:31] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. So, so good
[48:36] to see each of you in the visions that
[48:37] are with us today. We welcome you. You
[48:39] may be seated.
[48:43] As we have been looking at these virtues
[48:46] that God has given uh so many many years
[48:51] ago when Peter began to write it and no
[48:55] doubt the church as they got this
[48:57] epistle and they begin to read it and
[48:59] try to comprehend Peter as far as being
[49:03] a traveler, he was not a traveler the
[49:06] way that Paul was. He went to Babylon,
[49:09] went to mainly Judea, Jerusalem,
[49:13] Capernium, different places like that.
[49:16] So Peter wasn't able to go around and to
[49:19] be able to explain all these words that
[49:22] he meant. May have preached this in one
[49:24] place. who knows if he even got to
[49:26] preach it at all because this is coming
[49:29] close to the end of his life when he
[49:31] writes this which I find to be a
[49:33] phenomenal thing because Peter probably
[49:36] couldn't have written these things by
[49:38] experience not by revelation he could
[49:40] have he could have wrote them but he
[49:42] couldn't have written it by experience
[49:44] until years later in his life when he
[49:47] finally had grown up and become more
[49:50] mature. I love Peter. I I love him
[49:53] because he's the type of a guy that a
[49:55] lot of us are like, you know, made a lot
[49:57] of mistakes, a lot of shortcomings, and
[49:59] yet the Lord didn't trash him just
[50:01] because he messed up in life. But Peter
[50:04] was able to by the spirit of God catch
[50:07] the inspiration for it. And not only
[50:09] that, but to be able to live it. You've
[50:11] heard brother Bam said over and over
[50:12] again, don't just preach me a sermon,
[50:14] but live me one. To me, that's the only
[50:16] kind, if I was a sheep, that's the only
[50:19] kind of a pastor that I could sit under.
[50:21] Was not just a man that preached well.
[50:24] And he might have done great signs and
[50:25] wonders and all that's good. We believe
[50:27] in that. But if he's not living what
[50:29] he's preaching himself, I find it hard
[50:31] to have confidence in that. And I find
[50:34] it hard to be corrected by a man that's
[50:36] not even living what he's preaching.
[50:38] Y'all feel the same way?
[50:40] &gt;&gt; So Peter would have had a, you know,
[50:42] difficult time himself. But whenever
[50:44] people could no doubt in that day see
[50:47] this manifested in his life, it had such
[50:51] an impact upon those that was able to
[50:54] know him. Now remember, as far as fame,
[50:56] as we would say, he was quite a famous
[50:58] person. So in the first century, he'd
[51:00] have been one of great notoriety, of
[51:03] great spiritual admiration that the
[51:04] people would have had for him. And
[51:06] rightly so, because he had personal
[51:08] stories about the Lord Jesus that he's
[51:11] able to say that nobody else could say.
[51:13] But it wasn't going to be those stories
[51:16] because when you read about some of
[51:17] these men, it was not them that even
[51:20] wrote the stories about theirel. So
[51:22] Peter never gave an autobiography or an
[51:24] autobiography of someone else writing it
[51:26] about him. But he spent the time that he
[51:29] did write about the grace of God, the
[51:31] mercy of God, the virtues of God, which
[51:34] I love that myself. And these men did
[51:36] not write about themsel. And it wasn't
[51:38] well I saw this and I did that. I went
[51:40] there and I went over there and I
[51:42] preached this and I preached that. That
[51:44] wasn't what the Lord inspired them to to
[51:46] write about. So whenever we can see that
[51:49] God anointed this man to be able to
[51:52] write about these things that apparently
[51:54] the spirit of God felt was so
[51:56] imperative. So it's not like an option
[51:59] on your car. What do you want power
[52:01] windows or crank windows? Do you want
[52:03] you know air condition or no air
[52:05] condition? But this is an absolute
[52:07] requirement for the rapture which means
[52:09] we've all here got to have it. Right?
[52:12] &gt;&gt; I want it myself. Now then Paul would
[52:15] come in the same way. And remember now
[52:17] they're writing under the influence of
[52:20] the divine nature themsel. So they're
[52:23] not just theologians are standing there
[52:25] trying to go through all the Greek and
[52:26] the Aramaic words and you know rightly
[52:28] divide this and that and the other by
[52:30] human intellect, but they're writing
[52:32] this and living this out by the power of
[52:35] what Paul what Peter call the divine
[52:37] nature. Paul picks it up and writes
[52:40] about it a little bit different but the
[52:42] same thing. Now let's read again if you
[52:44] would today in Philippians chapter 2:14.
[52:47] Uh so godliness means to be like God. So
[52:51] God heals the sick, then we're going to
[52:53] do the same. God raises the dead, we'll
[52:55] do the same. We want to be like God. But
[52:58] it's not just in works alone that will
[53:01] bring this godliness, but it will be of
[53:04] character that we live by this divine
[53:07] nature inside of our soul. It comes out
[53:10] automatic. It's just as automatic as it
[53:12] can be. Now watch. Paul says in
[53:14] Philippians 2:14, "Do all things without
[53:18] murmurings and disputings."
[53:22] Do all things without murmurings. And
[53:26] the meaning of this word is quite
[53:27] phenomenal because it's not necessarily
[53:30] vocalizing your complaint. It's keeping
[53:33] your complaint within yourself and
[53:36] you're murmuring about what you have to
[53:38] do.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. I thought this would be a
[53:44] good verse to start out with this
[53:46] morning.
[53:47] So, do all things without murmurings and
[53:51] disputings, which is arguing and fussing
[53:53] and things like that. Now, notice he he
[53:56] writes this and then he he writes that
[53:58] to lead in to verse 15, that you may be
[54:03] blameless.
[54:04] How many wants to be blameless?
[54:07] So do all things without murmurings and
[54:11] disputings that you may be blameless. So
[54:15] the word blameless is without reproach.
[54:18] Now it's above reproach where people
[54:20] cannot censure your life and say that
[54:24] man's a liar. That woman, she does this
[54:26] and that man and that man and that
[54:28] woman. And they're not talking rumors
[54:30] and gossip, but they're actually talking
[54:31] the truth. Now friend, what good does it
[54:34] do us to talk about the thunders and the
[54:36] seals and all of that if we don't live
[54:38] what the Bible tells us to live? How
[54:40] many believes these scriptures are still
[54:42] needful for us as the saints of God?
[54:44] Absolutely. Do all things without
[54:46] murmurings and disputings that you may
[54:49] be blameless. So your life is going to
[54:52] be above blame. So people cannot point
[54:55] their finger at you and say that man
[54:58] drinks. That man runs around with
[55:00] somebody else's wife. Well, that man's a
[55:02] flirter. That woman does this and what
[55:04] that woman does that. Now, people can
[55:06] say all kinds of things. But if they're
[55:08] saying it and it's true, then you ought
[55:11] to be ashamed of yourself. Praise the
[55:13] Lord. That you may be blameless. Now, he
[55:17] also ties in another powerful word and
[55:20] harmless.
[55:22] Blameless
[55:23] and harmless. Look at the meaning of
[55:26] this word. unmixed, pure as in wines or
[55:31] metals without a mixture of evil. And I
[55:36] thought this one word was just amazing.
[55:39] Hornless.
[55:42] Hornless.
[55:44] So it means you're not a billygoat
[55:47] ramming people.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; No horns.
[55:51] Amen.
[55:53] Praise the Lord. How many wants to be
[55:55] hornless?
[55:57] Now, think about it. What this means to
[55:59] be harmless?
[56:02] Harmless. So, what are we talking about?
[56:04] We're talking about people that are more
[56:06] than just save people. More than people
[56:09] that just go to church on the occasion,
[56:11] pay their tithes, they help the widow,
[56:13] they help the poor. But they are people
[56:16] that have something so supernatural has
[56:19] happened to their life that many of them
[56:22] had horns prior to the new births but
[56:26] something happened to them by a change
[56:28] of their nature and they have been
[56:30] rendered hornless.
[56:34] So they don't go around pushing
[56:36] everybody with their horns. They don't
[56:39] go around like a billy goat butting
[56:41] everybody and hitting them and and
[56:44] trying to injure people. It's not even
[56:47] in their nature to be injurous to others
[56:51] whether in property or person. Now
[56:55] watch. He said that you may be blameless
[56:59] and harmless. So you're going to be
[57:01] without a mixture of evil, hornless or
[57:06] sincere. without mixture of deceit or
[57:10] guile. So in other words, you will not
[57:13] have this capability by divine nature to
[57:17] be sweet and gentle and kind to the
[57:20] people that are sweet and gentle and
[57:23] kind to you. And then you have this
[57:25] other part inside of you which is guile
[57:28] and wrath and bitterness. And you
[57:31] reserve that to those who aren't kind to
[57:34] you. No, as a matter of fact, if we ever
[57:37] arrive to this state, we'll actually be
[57:41] that way to everybody,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; whether they're kind to us or not. Well,
[57:46] I can certainly love this man because
[57:48] he's so nice to me. No, that's not it.
[57:51] You would love that person who would
[57:53] kill you if they had the opportunity.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm talking about
[57:59] rapture material this morning. I ain't
[58:01] just talking about message people. Some
[58:04] of the worst people I've ever dealt with
[58:05] in my life are so-called message people.
[58:09] Now, I'm not saying now because they're
[58:10] bad now that that's their destiny. But
[58:12] I'm saying if we don't get changed, we
[58:15] ain't going in no rapture. I don't care
[58:17] how long your hair is. I don't care,
[58:19] brothers. You may be so godly and so
[58:21] whatever on the outside, but this is
[58:24] something that comes from the inside
[58:26] out. And without it, we're not the bride
[58:29] of Christ.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Well, preach, Brother Donnie. Now, I can
[58:33] preach an amen, too. But it's certainly
[58:35] a lot easier if y'all help me.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And if you can't say amen, say, "Oh, me
[58:39] or ouch," or "God, help us all." At
[58:41] least I know you're alive. Now, notice
[58:44] that you may be blameless and harmless.
[58:47] Now, notice that he uses these great
[58:49] adjectives that we don't murmur and we
[58:52] don't complain about what we're supposed
[58:54] to do without disputings. So, we don't
[58:57] argue about it. And then we're blameless
[59:00] and we're harmless. And after these
[59:02] things are manifesting themselves in our
[59:05] lives, then we get the great title
[59:10] of sons
[59:12] &gt;&gt; of God.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Notice the order of the scripture. that
[59:19] you may be blameless and harmless, the
[59:22] sons of God, without rebuke,
[59:27] censure, a judgment against you, which
[59:31] is true in reality, that we may be
[59:34] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[59:38] and perverse nation, among whom ye shine
[59:43] as lights in the world. So we're talking
[59:47] about an absolute miracle then because
[59:50] we cannot help the nature we receive
[59:53] from our parents or our our just our our
[59:57] air that we got from them. Oh goodness
[1:00:00] some of the things we got from our
[1:00:01] family was absolutely awesome. Other
[1:00:03] things not so much. some of our
[1:00:06] temperament, you know, whatever that we
[1:00:08] receive. But can you imagine a person
[1:00:11] that comes through the process of the
[1:00:13] new birth and they wind up being
[1:00:15] blameless and they wind up being
[1:00:19] harmless.
[1:00:21] They do not have the capability in their
[1:00:24] soul to harm
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; one person.
[1:00:29] It's not in them.
[1:00:32] It's totally not in them to harm
[1:00:36] anybody.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Y'all want me to go on or you want me to
[1:00:41] dismiss and let you go eat dinner?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; All right. You asked for it.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Harmless. that is that we can appear to
[1:00:52] be harmless but not not just appear to
[1:00:56] be harmless but we actually are harmless
[1:01:00] in our nature. So where we going to get
[1:01:02] this from Christ Jesus our husband.
[1:01:07] And remember it's not in us to be like
[1:01:09] this. And you know gentile people just
[1:01:11] like I do. But yet you you be around
[1:01:14] them long enough and you'll find
[1:01:15] something that pushes their buttons as
[1:01:18] we say. You'll find something that just
[1:01:20] gets under their skin. And boy, I'll
[1:01:22] tell you what, they'll give you a piece
[1:01:24] of your mind. Well, mine's so scattered
[1:01:26] anymore. I figure I better keep all of
[1:01:28] mine. And I figure you better, too. Now
[1:01:31] notice since so there's no ability in
[1:01:34] the nature to be injurous to any person.
[1:01:39] So you do not devise evil. You do not
[1:01:43] think of ways by which you can get back
[1:01:46] at people and sat around and ponder in
[1:01:49] your mind, I'm going to get them. I'm
[1:01:51] going to do this. I'm going to do that.
[1:01:53] No, it it's just absolutely not in your
[1:01:56] soul. Now in your flesh, yeah, that's a
[1:01:59] different story. And that's where your
[1:02:00] battle will be. Amen. So you're a new
[1:02:04] creation in the same old temple. So the
[1:02:07] new nature does not have the ability be
[1:02:10] to be injurous. It does not have the
[1:02:12] ability to devise evil. But the flesh
[1:02:16] can still give you pointers on how to
[1:02:19] get back at folks. And you will do which
[1:02:22] one is dominating your life, which is
[1:02:25] your choice.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now the idea is that these
[1:02:30] people would live this simple godly holy
[1:02:33] life without guile. They have no guile.
[1:02:38] They are not a crow. They are not, you
[1:02:41] know, one of these birds that can be
[1:02:42] able to eat grain and then be able to
[1:02:45] eat meat. Now notice they are not a
[1:02:47] scavenger. And we know that there's many
[1:02:50] types in the Bible that type God's
[1:02:52] people. Always been. There's in the
[1:02:54] animal kingdom and the botany life and
[1:02:57] all types of things. And we know that an
[1:02:59] eagle is a great great type for the
[1:03:02] message and the prophet messenger and
[1:03:03] all of that. But let's not leave out
[1:03:06] another bird which is also a type of us,
[1:03:10] the dove.
[1:03:12] Now the dove has no guile and the eagle
[1:03:16] is a ripper of the beak with a beak. But
[1:03:19] do you know that an eagle can also prey
[1:03:23] on other birds?
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Do you know that an eagle prays? Without
[1:03:28] prey, he cannot survive. I've seen it,
[1:03:31] friends, and you have as well, that many
[1:03:33] of the folks in the message, they very
[1:03:35] well display the attributes of an eagle.
[1:03:39] They rip with a beak. They tear. They
[1:03:42] destroy. They actually get pleasure out
[1:03:46] of running people down and hurting
[1:03:48] people. Preachers do, too.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And do you realize you've ne never yet
[1:03:55] come to the full baptism of the Holy
[1:03:57] Ghost? If that's in you this morning,
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you preached for 130
[1:04:01] years.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; There's preachers around this message
[1:04:04] that don't have the Holy Ghost either.
[1:04:06] It's evident.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the real nature that God wants
[1:04:12] us to have. Notice in Proverbs 3:29,
[1:04:16] devise not evil. So this is contemplate,
[1:04:20] think about, devise not evil against thy
[1:04:23] neighbor, seeing he dwelleth securely by
[1:04:26] thee. Proverbs 14:22. Do they not heir
[1:04:30] that devise evil? But mercy and truth
[1:04:34] shall be to them that devise good. Now
[1:04:38] remember, it was the nature of the
[1:04:40] scribes, the Pharisees, the the
[1:04:42] Herodians, the Essenes, and the lawyers,
[1:04:45] and the days of the Lord Jesus. It was
[1:04:47] their nature to try to pick his words.
[1:04:51] It was their nature to send people out
[1:04:55] that would go hear him preach, but they
[1:04:57] didn't go for any good. They only went
[1:04:59] that they might catch him in his words.
[1:05:03] Now that tells you a lot about folks
[1:05:04] who've left the message and the type of
[1:05:06] attitude they get under as well. So
[1:05:09] Christians then their goal is to be
[1:05:12] blameless and harmless as the sons and
[1:05:16] daughters of God. Now notice the Lord
[1:05:17] Jesus in Matthew 10:1 16. Behold, I send
[1:05:22] you forth as sheep in the midst of
[1:05:25] wolves. And you say, "What? Lord Jesus,
[1:05:28] why would you do this?" Now remember
[1:05:30] this is Matthew 10. when the Lord Jesus
[1:05:32] is sending the apostles out two by two.
[1:05:35] But this scripture does not just end
[1:05:38] with the application of it to the
[1:05:39] apostles, but it's going to be carried
[1:05:41] on right on down through the church
[1:05:43] ages. And it's apparent that it's
[1:05:45] evident in the age that we live in. So,
[1:05:47] but we can take hope and courage to know
[1:05:50] that who sent them out was the Lord
[1:05:53] Jesus. So, if he sent them out, he sent
[1:05:55] them out with a divine purpose and also
[1:05:58] give them divine protection. So there's
[1:06:01] comfort in that part of it. Now listen
[1:06:03] to his words. Behold, I send you forth
[1:06:05] as sheep in the midst of wolves. Sheep
[1:06:10] in the midst of wolves. Why in the world
[1:06:13] would he do that? Because there's still
[1:06:15] some sheep in there amongst them wolves
[1:06:19] that are currently acting like wolves,
[1:06:22] but they just don't know it yet. But
[1:06:23] they're actually going to be sheep after
[1:06:25] a while. So you've got to send the sheep
[1:06:28] among the wolves sometimes in order to
[1:06:31] get more sheep's attention so they can
[1:06:34] see sheep life, sheep nature, sheep
[1:06:37] demonstration. And when they see that
[1:06:40] that within itself, the seed passing
[1:06:42] through the body, then it births them
[1:06:45] out of that wolf chaos that they were
[1:06:47] born in. And then it turns them and
[1:06:50] transforms them into sheep as well.
[1:06:52] That's my that's our master. That's what
[1:06:54] he does. Now notice then that he said I
[1:06:57] send you out as sheep among wolves
[1:07:01] defenseless.
[1:07:03] When the prophet talked about the sheep,
[1:07:05] he said, "A dog can bark. A squirrel can
[1:07:08] climb up a tree. A rabbit can run. And
[1:07:11] what defense does a sheep have? None.
[1:07:18] So you want me to tell you how close you
[1:07:19] are to God? Let me see how you react in
[1:07:22] your trials and under duress and stress
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; and let me watch your defense.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you where you are with God.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; So if you automatically go right into
[1:07:35] anger and boy, I'll tell you one thing.
[1:07:37] I'll get on the phone and I I'll tell
[1:07:39] you right there, you need more God.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz the sheep nature is totally
[1:07:46] defenseless.
[1:07:48] There's no way, friends, for us as sheep
[1:07:54] to constantly be thinking about myself
[1:07:56] and my rights. They shouldn't do that to
[1:07:58] me. It ain't right.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; My my.
[1:08:06] Now, I'm going to send you as sheep
[1:08:09] among wolves,
[1:08:12] and you're not going to have one defense
[1:08:15] in yourself.
[1:08:17] You will be totally defenseless. There
[1:08:19] will be times that you will feel like
[1:08:22] you're going to lose your mind. You're
[1:08:24] being so uh h oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:08:26] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh my
[1:08:26] oppressed by the enemy and by people and
[1:08:29] you don't know what to do. Some of you
[1:08:32] that feel that way and you're scared to
[1:08:33] death. You ought to be so happy you just
[1:08:35] about dance around the devil's camp a
[1:08:38] little bit because you know what? It's a
[1:08:40] sign you're a sheep.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; You're a sheep. If you've got a personal
[1:08:45] defense for everything that everybody
[1:08:48] does for you, I worry about you. If
[1:08:51] you've got a defense for everything that
[1:08:53] comes against you in your flesh, you're
[1:08:56] still living after the carnal man. But
[1:08:58] the real sign of a sheep is sometimes
[1:09:01] they don't know what to do. They don't
[1:09:02] know which way to go. They don't know
[1:09:04] what to do this, that, and they say, "Oh
[1:09:06] Lord, I don't know what to do." And he
[1:09:07] said, "I do. I'm your shepherd. Come to
[1:09:09] me." Amen. Come to me. Don't try to do
[1:09:12] it yourself. Don't get on Facebook and
[1:09:15] do it this way and that way and that
[1:09:16] way. You understand what people are
[1:09:18] doing in the age that we live by social
[1:09:20] media. They're taking their own battles
[1:09:22] into their own hands and they're trying
[1:09:24] to fight it this way or this way with
[1:09:27] their thumbs and you're forfeiting help
[1:09:31] from Almighty God.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; So
[1:09:39] go out there amongst them. They're
[1:09:41] dangerous. They hate you. They'll want
[1:09:44] to kill you.
[1:09:47] They'll want to destroy you. But I'm
[1:09:50] sending you
[1:09:54] defenseless,
[1:09:56] helpless.
[1:09:58] You can't bite them. You can't kick
[1:10:01] them. You can't climb up a tree. You're
[1:10:04] a sheep. You're not a squirrel.
[1:10:07] You're defenseless.
[1:10:10] humanly.
[1:10:13] But don't worry, you've got help.
[1:10:17] And I will send you out in offensive.
[1:10:20] You will not go out and I'll tell you
[1:10:23] one thing. I'll do this and I'll do
[1:10:25] that. No,
[1:10:27] you'll be inoffensive yourself and
[1:10:30] totally harmless.
[1:10:34] Can you imagine a little baby
[1:10:38] being absolutely totally harmless
[1:10:44] and indefensive of its own rights, its
[1:10:47] own life. It's only when it goes to
[1:10:51] growing up and it's sad really when we
[1:10:54] see our kids. I've seen some of our
[1:10:56] youth as they're growing up physically,
[1:10:58] you know, psychologically and you you
[1:11:00] listen to their their terms as they're
[1:11:02] talking and you can tell they're getting
[1:11:04] further along in their education and
[1:11:06] things like that. And we're we're
[1:11:08] supposed to do that. We know. But
[1:11:09] there's always an element of maturing
[1:11:12] that you see they lose and and they you
[1:11:15] know some of them can lose a little bit
[1:11:17] of of love and they can lose a little
[1:11:19] bit of insensitivity. And one thing that
[1:11:21] always bothers me is whenever we see our
[1:11:23] youth and they're coming out of a
[1:11:25] dispensation which was the first one
[1:11:27] that man was in and it's called the
[1:11:29] dispensation of innocence.
[1:11:32] So the more they're exposed to the world
[1:11:34] and the more they're exposed to social
[1:11:36] media and the more they're exposed to
[1:11:38] television and all kinds of garbage and
[1:11:40] filth then they don't realize it and
[1:11:42] maybe you don't as parents but it's
[1:11:44] eroding part of that innocence
[1:11:47] that innocence that they have. But you
[1:11:49] understand what the new birth does. It
[1:11:52] actually reverts you back to the first
[1:11:55] dispensation that man was ever in.
[1:11:59] Innocence.
[1:12:01] innocence to where you don't learn. You
[1:12:03] don't learn how to get even. You don't
[1:12:06] learn. It's it's not even in you to
[1:12:08] think that way. It's so sad whenever we
[1:12:11] can see that our youth and you know you
[1:12:13] watch them of their behavior and things
[1:12:15] that are happening in their lives and
[1:12:17] they have to learn to deal with it. We
[1:12:18] can only homeschool them for so far. We
[1:12:20] can only home this and home that. Then
[1:12:22] we got to push them out in the world.
[1:12:24] Let their light so shine. Is that right?
[1:12:27] And yet at the same time, we know that
[1:12:29] it takes the spirit of God to do this
[1:12:31] work in them. Notice Jesus goes on to
[1:12:34] say, "Beware,
[1:12:35] Matthew 7:15, of false prophets which
[1:12:40] come to you
[1:12:42] and sheep's
[1:12:44] clothing."
[1:12:46] Now, you not only will encounter the
[1:12:49] wolves of the world, which don't even
[1:12:51] profess any Christianity at all. uh they
[1:12:54] just they don't even believe there is a
[1:12:56] God. Scientific research and all that,
[1:12:58] that's the only thing they know. That's
[1:13:00] where their faith is. That's where their
[1:13:01] trust is. And you will meet wolves that
[1:13:04] will be infidels, agnostics,
[1:13:07] unbelievers.
[1:13:09] But them wolves are not near as
[1:13:11] dangerous
[1:13:13] as religious wolves. Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Now them wolves will come to you without
[1:13:22] sheep clothes on.
[1:13:25] But these wolves,
[1:13:27] beware of false prophets,
[1:13:31] religious people,
[1:13:33] beware of false prophets which come to
[1:13:36] you in sheep's
[1:13:39] clothing.
[1:13:40] Look at the meaning of the word
[1:13:42] clothing. Raymond garment clothing cloak
[1:13:47] an outer garment.
[1:13:51] So this wolf gets him a sheep's costume.
[1:13:56] He pulls it up on this leg. Then he puts
[1:13:59] this foot this leg pulls it up like
[1:14:02] this. Pulls it all over around him. Then
[1:14:06] he reaches down here and gets the
[1:14:08] zipper.
[1:14:12] And remember, he ain't got on just
[1:14:15] sheep's clothing from feet up to the
[1:14:17] neck level. He's also got a sheep's
[1:14:20] head.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; So, he's going to be so covered up
[1:14:27] that it will take the spirit of God to
[1:14:30] help you to be able to know the
[1:14:32] difference. Now, because this is a
[1:14:34] costume, no doubt he saturated it and
[1:14:38] soaked it in sheep smell because if he
[1:14:43] come up smelling like a wolf, now the
[1:14:46] sheep has that sensitivity in its nose
[1:14:48] and it would be able to pick up that
[1:14:50] odor because as a little bitty old
[1:14:52] thing, its mom and daddy begin to teach
[1:14:55] it about that. So, it just didn't look
[1:14:57] at it, but it smelled. And when it
[1:14:59] smelled, it went into its nostrils which
[1:15:01] releases like an endorphin in its body
[1:15:04] and it produces fear and it goes to
[1:15:05] shaking and trembling. The smell does
[1:15:07] that. So this this creature now here he
[1:15:11] come.
[1:15:17] So he gets in the flock.
[1:15:20] Where y'all going today? Oh, we're going
[1:15:22] to uh Kabas for lunch. Can I go with
[1:15:27] you?
[1:15:29] I want fellowship.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure, brother. Glory to God. You
[1:15:35] smell like us. Your nose is like ours.
[1:15:37] Your ears are like ours. Your eyes are
[1:15:40] like ours. Because the costume is so
[1:15:43] deceiving.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:48] But you know, a real sheep
[1:15:51] don't have a zipper.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's reflecting what he is from the
[1:15:58] inside out. So a sheep don't have to put
[1:16:01] on a costume.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; He bears wool.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; He bears wool by nature. Now notice then
[1:16:08] Jesus says, "But inwardly, inwardly they
[1:16:13] are ravening wolves." And a ravener
[1:16:15] ravening is extortioner, rapacious or a
[1:16:19] robber. So they are a robber, but
[1:16:22] actually they are a wolf in sheep's
[1:16:26] clothing. Now this don't have to be
[1:16:27] limited of course just to preachers
[1:16:29] because it can be somebody that you made
[1:16:31] at work. It can be somebody that you
[1:16:34] hook up with at school, whatever. And
[1:16:36] the devil wants to start them to
[1:16:38] influence you. Oh, I'm hungry for
[1:16:40] scriptures in the Bible. Oh, okay. Let's
[1:16:42] let's talk about the Bible. And then
[1:16:44] then you don't even realize it. You've
[1:16:45] let your guard down because they go to
[1:16:47] talking about the Bible. Oh yeah, praise
[1:16:48] the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let's talk
[1:16:50] about the Bible. And the next thing you
[1:16:52] know, they're questioning you about what
[1:16:53] you believe and what church you go to.
[1:16:55] Where do you go? Word of Life Church,
[1:16:57] Oklahoma. Oh, is that that one church?
[1:16:59] That one crazy preacher. I I seen his
[1:17:02] picture in the newspaper not long ago,
[1:17:04] didn't I? Well, not that one that was on
[1:17:06] YouTube. Oh, Lord have mercy. Don't tell
[1:17:08] me y'all are in that cult thing. Are you
[1:17:10] Do you go to that skirt church? Oh my
[1:17:13] goodness. Honey, God have mercy on your
[1:17:15] poor soul. You need to talk to my
[1:17:17] pastor. You need to talk to my grandma.
[1:17:19] You need to talk to my
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; You better be careful, Little Red Riding
[1:17:26] Hood.
[1:17:31] Notice Acts 20 29 that Paul now he knew
[1:17:35] this was coming and he said for I know
[1:17:39] this that after my departing shall
[1:17:42] grievous wolves enter in among you not
[1:17:46] sparing the flock. Now he said also of
[1:17:50] your own selves of your own selves shall
[1:17:55] men arise speaking perverse things. And
[1:17:58] this is the reason why they do it to
[1:18:00] draw away disciples after them. So these
[1:18:04] wolves then that Paul is referring to is
[1:18:07] no doubt preachers. God knows we've
[1:18:09] certainly had them, haven't we? Down
[1:18:11] through the ages. And it's always been
[1:18:13] and it always will be. So these are
[1:18:16] enemies of the gospel, the message of
[1:18:19] the hour. And as wolves have this
[1:18:22] inclination in them to kill sheep. Now,
[1:18:26] you know, it's amazing how that a wolf
[1:18:28] itself can be able to tell that and
[1:18:30] they're they're able apparently it's
[1:18:32] something that they watch and observe
[1:18:34] from little pups themselves and their
[1:18:36] parents will bring them this this sheep
[1:18:38] and that the taste of it in their mouth
[1:18:41] and they develop it. As they get older,
[1:18:43] they start watching. They lay down and
[1:18:45] they watch mama and daddy hunt. And his
[1:18:47] mama gets out there and they see the
[1:18:48] sheep. And then when the wolf goes right
[1:18:50] toward it, the little sheep just kind of
[1:18:52] humps up like this and he just stands
[1:18:54] there and quivers and shake. And then he
[1:18:56] may take off running, but he'll delay.
[1:18:58] And that delay cost him his life. And
[1:19:00] he'll wait for a few minutes. And then
[1:19:02] when he does, the wolf can way outrun
[1:19:04] him. And not only by speed, but also by
[1:19:07] its ability and its agility to run for
[1:19:09] miles and miles and miles. A wolf can
[1:19:13] run an elk. An elk can fly as far as his
[1:19:15] feet. But one thing that the wolf will
[1:19:17] have, he can stay behind him uh for
[1:19:19] 1,000 yards and keep him inside. And
[1:19:22] he's got a plan in mind. Keep right on
[1:19:24] running. That elk with that, 1100 lb of
[1:19:27] weight, he just going and pushing and
[1:19:29] charging. After a while, you see his
[1:19:31] tongue hanging out of his mouth. He
[1:19:33] can't hardly breathe. He can't hardly
[1:19:35] go. And the wolf just keeps right on.
[1:19:38] You know why? He's pacing himself. He's
[1:19:41] pacing himself. That's the way he does
[1:19:43] to us with trials and tests of life. And
[1:19:46] so get away from me, devil. Get away
[1:19:48] from me, devil. Boy, you take off
[1:19:49] running. You're like the roadrunner.
[1:19:51] Beep beep. Here I come. Get out of my
[1:19:52] way, devil. And now, yeah, I've got him.
[1:19:55] Hallelujah. I've got him today. But that
[1:19:57] was just today. And remember, tomorrow
[1:19:59] he'll be at you again. And the next day,
[1:20:02] he'll be at you again because he's
[1:20:03] looking at the long hall. He's looking
[1:20:06] at long term because he's dealt with
[1:20:08] Christians for thousands of years. And
[1:20:10] he knows one of the ways to get them is
[1:20:13] keep hammering them day after day.
[1:20:16] Stress, trial, sickness, trouble,
[1:20:18] tribulation. Come on, church. And yet he
[1:20:21] knows, oh yeah, they're all right.
[1:20:23] They're doing good. Day five, day seven,
[1:20:25] day nine, day 10. Yeah, they're doing
[1:20:27] really good. But what I'm longing for is
[1:20:29] day 14 when I'll watch them begin to
[1:20:32] break and their tongue hanging out of
[1:20:33] their mouth and they start missing
[1:20:35] church and they quit reading their Bible
[1:20:37] and they don't have a prayer life no
[1:20:39] more. Preach, Brother Donnie. And then
[1:20:41] what's he doing? You say, "Oh, I I'm
[1:20:43] doing okay. I'm doing okay." Uh-huh.
[1:20:45] You're like a little boy walking through
[1:20:47] the graveyard. You're scared to death.
[1:20:48] That's what's the matter with you. And
[1:20:50] the devil notices it and he watches you
[1:20:52] as you're begin to break and he knows,
[1:20:55] "Yeah, all right. Day 14, it's working.
[1:20:58] Day 15, day 16, just keep on going." And
[1:21:01] eventually you get to where you
[1:21:08] but you're so caught up in your
[1:21:11] breathing
[1:21:13] them tracks are moving
[1:21:16] in the soft snow
[1:21:19] and before you know it he's jumped on
[1:21:21] your back,
[1:21:23] lunged around your neck and got your
[1:21:25] jugular
[1:21:27] in between his jaws.
[1:21:31] Oh my.
[1:21:34] And the Lord Jesus knew it would be this
[1:21:37] way.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; But he says, "You're going to be totally
[1:21:40] defenseless on your own, but if you'll
[1:21:43] let me come in you,
[1:21:46] hallelujah, you and I together are a
[1:21:49] team. And I and you will be greater than
[1:21:53] any match for anything hell can ever
[1:21:56] produce."
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] Now, notice Jesus
[1:22:02] as he gives us, this is amazing to me,
[1:22:05] the analogy
[1:22:07] of what we're to do and how we're to
[1:22:09] handle this type of a scenario. Behold,
[1:22:13] I send you forth as sheep in the midst
[1:22:15] of wolves.
[1:22:16] Be ye therefore wise as serpents.
[1:22:23] Why would we want anything to do with a
[1:22:27] snake?
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; What about us is snake like?
[1:22:38] Be ye therefore as wise, notice, not
[1:22:41] slithering, not stealthy,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; but wise
[1:22:47] as serpents. and what a strange
[1:22:50] combination
[1:22:51] and as harmless
[1:22:54] as doves.
[1:22:56] Now don't be tempered like an old copper
[1:22:59] head. Any of you that's ever dealt with
[1:23:00] copperhead boy I'm saying what they're
[1:23:01] mean on the devil. At least a
[1:23:03] rattlesnake will warn you a side winder
[1:23:06] eastern western diamond back whatever
[1:23:08] they are. At least they're going to give
[1:23:09] you a little rattle on you. Hear that?
[1:23:11] You better head out. But not the
[1:23:13] copperhead. The copper head will wait.
[1:23:16] The moccasin will wait, the black mamba,
[1:23:19] many of them. And yet the Lord Jesus
[1:23:22] would tell us to get something that the
[1:23:26] serpent has
[1:23:28] wisdom.
[1:23:32] Some of y'all are looking the way I
[1:23:34] looked a few days ago when I found this
[1:23:36] scripture. And I thought, Lord, are you
[1:23:38] kidding me?
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; I'm supposed to have something. And
[1:23:42] after I begin to study this, I realized
[1:23:45] in my life's journey
[1:23:48] for years, I've been so concentrated on
[1:23:51] dove nature,
[1:23:54] dove sold
[1:23:57] that there are times, no doubt in my
[1:23:59] mind, I have not had the wisdom of a
[1:24:03] serpent.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Well, hang with me. It'll make more
[1:24:11] sense after a while.
[1:24:14] Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the
[1:24:18] midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise
[1:24:22] as serpents and harmless as dove. So,
[1:24:26] what is it then about a serpent that the
[1:24:28] Lord Jesus would want us to have? Well,
[1:24:30] a serpent is it's prudent.
[1:24:34] It's discreet
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; and one of the fastest animals that
[1:24:40] there is
[1:24:42] and subtly to be able to escape harm and
[1:24:46] danger
[1:24:49] because you see him and then once he
[1:24:52] sees you see him he's gone. How many's
[1:24:56] ever run across one before and after you
[1:24:59] woke up from passing out I mean you
[1:25:00] looked around the snake was gone right?
[1:25:03] I don't like any of them.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. If you're a serpent lover,
[1:25:07] you know, that's it's up to you. I don't
[1:25:09] like any of them. To me, they all can
[1:25:10] cause heart attacks.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; I don't care what color they are, what
[1:25:14] size they are, and I might be able to
[1:25:15] handle one that long. I like to think
[1:25:17] about that one. But, you know, there was
[1:25:18] something about it. Why would the Lord
[1:25:20] Jesus bring two contrary natures and say
[1:25:25] that this is what his sheep children
[1:25:28] must have? They've got to be wise.
[1:25:32] as serpents and then you look at them
[1:25:34] and say well what is it about a snake
[1:25:36] that would even be wise. So no animal
[1:25:40] can be able to mimic mimic them and the
[1:25:43] rapidity by which rapid that they are
[1:25:46] able to get out of the presence when
[1:25:48] they feel danger. And a lot of them even
[1:25:51] though you may not think it they really
[1:25:53] don't want trouble.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; They really don't. You're standing there
[1:25:58] with a 22 in your pocket. You think
[1:26:00] they're going to attack you with that?
[1:26:02] Or bigger than that. You got a 9 mm and
[1:26:04] you think they're You've got a grubbing
[1:26:06] hoe. A mad up for you Tennessee people.
[1:26:08] You've got a gooseeneck hole in your
[1:26:10] hand. You think that snake will say,
[1:26:11] "Come on, boy. Come on. I'm here to that
[1:26:15] snake ain't that dumb."
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes if a lot of the
[1:26:20] trouble that we got into ourselves as
[1:26:23] Christians, it's because we lacked this
[1:26:26] wisdom.
[1:26:29] Praise the Lord. When I was studying on
[1:26:31] this, I looked in the Bible, of course,
[1:26:33] as as well as and I looked in the
[1:26:34] message and I found with the prophet
[1:26:36] talking about us being wise as serpents
[1:26:38] and as harmless as doves. And he was
[1:26:40] talking about us witnessing to other
[1:26:43] people and talking to them about the
[1:26:45] Lord. And he said, don't get out there
[1:26:46] now and just, you know, basically, let
[1:26:48] me let me paraphrase it to you that
[1:26:49] don't get out there and just try to cram
[1:26:51] it down their throat and just jump on
[1:26:53] them. And immediately he said, "But we
[1:26:55] as wise as a serpent." And this was his
[1:26:57] example. If they're a farmer, talk to
[1:26:59] him about farming.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Talk to him about fishing.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; So you see, it's it's not just, "Hey,
[1:27:07] have you heard God sent a prophet?" And
[1:27:08] he's standing there with a cigarette in
[1:27:10] his mouth and got 14 earrings and and
[1:27:12] nose rings and everything else. What in
[1:27:13] the world? Let's start with their soul.
[1:27:16] Let's get them to Jesus, then we'll tell
[1:27:17] them about the message. It's evident
[1:27:19] some folks have got to the message
[1:27:20] before they got to Jesus. Come on,
[1:27:23] brother Donnie. Oh, yes, sir. We want to
[1:27:25] get them to Jesus. Get them full of the
[1:27:27] Holy Ghost. And then we'll tell them,
[1:27:28] you know what? God sent a prophet. But
[1:27:30] let's tell them God sent his son first.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, look at the serpent and how
[1:27:38] that Jesus, you imagine the disciples as
[1:27:40] they were standing there. Now, remember,
[1:27:41] none of them have the Holy Ghost. And
[1:27:44] Jesus is sending them out on their first
[1:27:46] missionary journey and said, "Boys, I
[1:27:48] tell them what I want you to do. I want
[1:27:49] you to merge together two natures on
[1:27:51] this missionary trip. One of them is
[1:27:53] going to be of the serpent and the other
[1:27:55] one's going to be of a of dove.
[1:27:59] Imagine them leaving two by two brothers
[1:28:01] and say, "Did you get that?"
[1:28:05] I was afraid to say anything. I didn't
[1:28:07] know where to raise my hand and ask a
[1:28:08] question. Did you understand exactly
[1:28:10] what he meant about that serpent part,
[1:28:12] the dove part? I could understand
[1:28:14] because that's what he is. But
[1:28:18] wise in avoiding danger
[1:28:22] instead of looking for it. Wise in
[1:28:26] avoiding danger yet harmless
[1:28:29] in forcibly
[1:28:31] opposing the enemy.
[1:28:35] You imagine that we're to pull from both
[1:28:38] avenues as harmless as doves. The nature
[1:28:43] of the Christian then is to be wise. Not
[1:28:47] deceiving now, subility, but wise.
[1:28:50] You're not going out looking for
[1:28:52] trouble. You're not going out trying to
[1:28:53] stir it up. You'll have enough the way
[1:28:55] it is without looking for more.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; You see, the gospel actually makes us
[1:29:02] tame. So, we're to be gless and innocent
[1:29:07] like the dove. Why? The dove is his own
[1:29:13] inward nature of his soul. Now remember
[1:29:16] when Jesus was going to be baptized down
[1:29:18] at the river that day and the spirit of
[1:29:20] God come down in the form of a
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; wonder why it wasn't an eagle.
[1:29:29] After all, that's our favorite bird,
[1:29:31] isn't it?
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Eagle, eagle, eagle.
[1:29:35] But God chose a dove. And what was
[1:29:39] Jesus? The lamb.
[1:29:42] So the dove comes and lands on the lamb.
[1:29:46] Now had that lamb had a nature of a
[1:29:50] wolf,
[1:29:53] the dove would have never landed on it,
[1:29:55] why? The wolf would have killed it.
[1:30:01] Do you understand? And when we let these
[1:30:03] things h hang on to our life, we are
[1:30:06] killing
[1:30:08] the influence
[1:30:10] of the dove,
[1:30:12] the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:16] Oh Jesus, help us.
[1:30:19] The dove never provokes hostility.
[1:30:25] It don't know how.
[1:30:29] It don't know how to be hostile.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; We're going to get to brotherly kindness
[1:30:37] after a while if we can get to
[1:30:38] godliness.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be more godly?
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; There could not be two creatures whose
[1:30:47] natures would be more opposite than a
[1:30:50] snake
[1:30:52] and a dove.
[1:30:57] So the serpent will look at the dove
[1:30:59] with greedy intentions
[1:31:02] of killing and eating it.
[1:31:05] The dove will look at the snake
[1:31:08] trembling and terrified
[1:31:11] with a fascination of horror.
[1:31:14] And yet the Lord Jesus tells us to pull
[1:31:17] from both of them the attributes which
[1:31:19] are needed for this journey.
[1:31:24] It's amazing that a serpent can teach a
[1:31:26] dove nature something. You need to be
[1:31:28] like me.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; He recommends us as well as the
[1:31:39] disciples.
[1:31:41] You want to be so prudent.
[1:31:45] You want to be so wise and you're not
[1:31:47] going out looking for trouble and
[1:31:49] causing issues and tempting God. Wonder
[1:31:52] why Paul would have had them to let him
[1:31:55] down the wall of the city in a basket
[1:32:00] and he escaped.
[1:32:03] Now, if you'd have been living in that
[1:32:05] first church age and that message starts
[1:32:07] passing through the message people,
[1:32:09] message followers
[1:32:12] and just so happened your cousin was one
[1:32:15] of the team that helped lay him down in
[1:32:17] the rope by night and your cousin comes
[1:32:20] to your house the next day and said,
[1:32:21] "You can't believe what happened last
[1:32:23] night."
[1:32:25] Paul heard that they was going to kill
[1:32:27] him and you know what he done? He acted
[1:32:30] like a coward.
[1:32:33] He wanted us to put him in that basket
[1:32:36] and let him down after dark so he could
[1:32:40] run.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; What was he displaying? Wisdom of a
[1:32:51] serpent
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; looking for the fastest way out of town.
[1:32:57] ben it amazing that other things he
[1:33:00] would walk right in the middle of it and
[1:33:02] seem as if though been antagonist that
[1:33:04] he was the one who caused the issue.
[1:33:07] Can't you see it takes the spirit of God
[1:33:09] to help us? It takes the spirit of God
[1:33:11] to help us in our life. Lord, which one
[1:33:14] of these should handle this battle? The
[1:33:16] snake or the dove? Do I need wisdom to
[1:33:20] get out of this situation or do I need
[1:33:22] the grace of God to help me go through
[1:33:24] it?
[1:33:28] Oh my.
[1:33:31] Let me share this with you.
[1:33:35] It absolutely broke my heart
[1:33:38] when I read it.
[1:33:40] Under Dialesian, which was one of the
[1:33:42] Roman emperors.
[1:33:44] 17,000 Christians
[1:33:47] are said to have been slain in one
[1:33:49] month. among whom also was Serena the
[1:33:54] empress.
[1:33:58] A Roman emperor
[1:34:00] was killed because she was a Christian.
[1:34:04] Those
[1:34:06] 10 persecutions were so cruel that
[1:34:08] Jerome writes in one of his letters that
[1:34:11] for every day in the year
[1:34:15] Lord have mercy
[1:34:18] were murdered 5,000
[1:34:22] except on the first day of January.
[1:34:27] 5,000 every day of our brothers and
[1:34:30] sisters
[1:34:31] truly sheep among wolves.
[1:34:38] Gerisicus an Aryan king of vandals is
[1:34:42] said to have exceeded all that went
[1:34:45] before him and cruelty towards the
[1:34:47] orthodox side of both sexes male and
[1:34:50] female. and that leninia and parenthesis
[1:34:54] 30,000 Protestants were basically
[1:34:58] butchered in one month 300,000
[1:35:04] in one year.
[1:35:09] How were they to die
[1:35:12] not like snakes?
[1:35:16] Any of you that's ever killed one
[1:35:18] before, you know they'll fight and
[1:35:19] they'll bite and they'll do whatever
[1:35:21] they can.
[1:35:24] But God, but his spirit anointed them
[1:35:26] not to die as a serpent would die, but
[1:35:31] die as a gentle dove.
[1:35:38] Why?
[1:35:40] That's the way our husband did.
[1:35:44] You see, the dove and its innocence and
[1:35:47] its harmlessness
[1:35:49] is one of the reasons that it was chosen
[1:35:53] in the days of Noah.
[1:35:55] Also because it has no gall, has no
[1:35:59] bitterness to be able to help it eat a
[1:36:02] carrying.
[1:36:04] So when he let the dove out
[1:36:07] when the waters had subsided, he felt
[1:36:10] like and Noah meet needed a messenger.
[1:36:15] Why didn't he turn loose a serpent?
[1:36:17] Wrong animal for the occasion.
[1:36:20] He had an eagle in there. Why didn't he
[1:36:22] turn loose a golden eagle?
[1:36:25] Why didn't he turn loose a bald eagle?
[1:36:30] I know some of you it's going to hurt
[1:36:31] your feelings when I tell you this, but
[1:36:33] eagles on occasion will either carry
[1:36:35] them.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; I've seen them with my own eyes.
[1:36:43] But the dove don't have the ability. It
[1:36:45] would make her so sick she could not eat
[1:36:48] it.
[1:36:50] Oh Lord.
[1:36:54] So he sends out a dove and she flies
[1:36:56] around and flies around gone. who knows
[1:36:58] how how long and she comes back wore
[1:37:00] out. Why? Because she didn't find a
[1:37:02] clean place to even set down her foot
[1:37:06] and rest a little bit.
[1:37:09] You see, when we get bitterness and
[1:37:11] anger and strife, family problems,
[1:37:14] church problems, and people get so
[1:37:16] bitter and won't even speak to one
[1:37:18] another.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand what you're doing
[1:37:22] to your dove?
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Your dove can't land on your temper.
[1:37:27] Your dove can't land on your wrath and
[1:37:30] your all those types of feelings. The
[1:37:32] dove just has to fly away
[1:37:37] until you get cleansed again.
[1:37:42] Notice in Matthew 3:1 16, "And Jesus
[1:37:45] when he was baptized went up straightway
[1:37:47] out of the water, and lo, the heavens
[1:37:48] were opened unto him, and he saw the
[1:37:50] spirit of God descending like a dove and
[1:37:53] lighting upon him." Hebrews 7:26, "For
[1:37:56] such an high priest became us,
[1:38:01] who is wholly,
[1:38:04] harmless,
[1:38:07] harmless."
[1:38:10] As Almighty God, he could have spoke
[1:38:12] from the cross. He said, "No, you're
[1:38:14] not. I could call down to my heavenly
[1:38:15] father and he would send me all these
[1:38:17] legions of angels." He could have just
[1:38:18] spoke the word and said, "Be destroyed,
[1:38:21] earth. be purged from all these
[1:38:24] unbelievers. Every sinner on the earth
[1:38:26] would have died at his spoken word.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; But he must die the life
[1:38:34] of a dove. Why? To answer the type in
[1:38:38] Leviticus.
[1:38:42] Hallelujah.
[1:38:45] when they would take two doves and
[1:38:48] they'd take them both to the priest
[1:38:51] and the dove, one of the doves, the
[1:38:53] priest would take in his hand and ring
[1:38:55] the head off of the dove
[1:39:00] and then take the blood of the dead dove
[1:39:06] and bathe the living dove.
[1:39:09] and then take the living dove over to a
[1:39:11] window and turn him loose.
[1:39:15] And as that dove was walking its walk,
[1:39:17] living its life, doing its journey, what
[1:39:19] was it doing? It was doing it under the
[1:39:22] power of the blood of what? A goat, an
[1:39:25] ox. The blood of its mate.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; The mate of that dove's life was taken
[1:39:33] and sprinkled on the life of the living
[1:39:36] mate. Did you see friends what why we're
[1:39:39] living right? Why we go to church? While
[1:39:40] we're doing these things, we claim we're
[1:39:42] the living mate of Jesus Christ. Are we
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; the living mate? Well, if we are, then
[1:39:48] we should live it as the power of a
[1:39:50] dove. Oh, Satan will do everything to
[1:39:53] make us angry and vile. Why? To make us
[1:39:56] dirty.
[1:39:58] If you could only see what anger and
[1:40:01] temper and resentment and holding
[1:40:03] grudges, if you could only see what that
[1:40:05] does to your soul
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; and your walk with God.
[1:40:13] Notice the prophet says church in his
[1:40:16] condition if the lamb of God would have
[1:40:18] made the first snarl like a wolf would
[1:40:20] have done anything contrary to what the
[1:40:23] gentle dove would have permitted the
[1:40:25] dove would have took her flight left in
[1:40:28] a minute. That's the reason today that
[1:40:29] we're wondering what's the matter with
[1:40:31] the Pentecostal church. It's because
[1:40:34] we've taken on a different nature. We've
[1:40:36] taken on a nature that now listen the
[1:40:38] nature that people take on. We want our
[1:40:42] rights.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; So and so did this to me. It's my right
[1:40:47] to get mad at them. It's my right. I
[1:40:50] won't speak to them. It is.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; It's your right.
[1:40:56] And with your right goes your comfort of
[1:41:00] the Holy Ghost. I don't know about you,
[1:41:02] this life is so difficult and so hard. I
[1:41:05] don't need him grieved away from me for
[1:41:07] a moment. But just a day, a week, a
[1:41:10] month, a year. I don't, friends. I need
[1:41:12] him every hour.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Well, what about my rights? Forget my
[1:41:16] rights. If I get to have his presence to
[1:41:19] forfeit my rights, take them all, Lord.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; But if I have to forfeit his presence to
[1:41:25] keep my rights, I don't want them. Amen.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; We're going to do what we know that's
[1:41:34] right to do. When we become arrogant, we
[1:41:38] become hostile.
[1:41:40] We become indifferent. We let temper
[1:41:43] come in. We let selfishness
[1:41:47] come in and all these things that little
[1:41:50] gentle dove just
[1:41:54] and there it goes
[1:41:56] and it follows you around.
[1:41:59] Please,
[1:42:01] please let me come back in.
[1:42:04] Please, I want to fellowship with you.
[1:42:10] Please.
[1:42:11] But it won't make you. It won't smack
[1:42:14] you up the side of the head. Hey, I s
[1:42:16] open up your heart. It will just sit on
[1:42:18] coups and cus. And then the spirit of
[1:42:20] God will anoint a preacher to preach
[1:42:22] something right where you live. Oh my
[1:42:24] goodness. Oh my goodness.
[1:42:26] Let that calm down. Don't you
[1:42:29] understand? The dove is right here this
[1:42:31] morning. For some of you, maybe you've
[1:42:33] grieved him away a month ago, a year
[1:42:35] ago, six months ago. You might have
[1:42:36] grieved him way before you walked into
[1:42:38] church. But can't you hear the hunger in
[1:42:40] his heart? Can't you hear the cry? You
[1:42:43] know, some of the greatest battles we're
[1:42:44] going to have in this last day of
[1:42:46] keeping his presence around us is going
[1:42:49] to be from people we go to church with
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; cuz we expect more of them and we
[1:42:56] should.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; An old sinner right out here hurt. Oh,
[1:43:00] they don't know nothing. There are no
[1:43:01] sinners. They're lost anyhow. But
[1:43:04] Christians that hurt us.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Don't raise your hands. But I wonder how
[1:43:09] many of you sitting here today, your
[1:43:10] greatest hurt has come from Christians
[1:43:13] and sometimes preachers.
[1:43:17] But don't you understand what it's all
[1:43:19] about?
[1:43:21] It's to get you to become something that
[1:43:25] the dove can't rest on.
[1:43:29] The dove finds its rest
[1:43:32] in the clean soul.
[1:43:36] Oh Jesus,
[1:43:38] help us, Lord.
[1:43:41] You remember when your heart used to be
[1:43:43] so tender and pure before God?
[1:43:46] Oh, you didn't mind troubles.
[1:43:49] Wow, I had to take a double look at this
[1:43:52] quote.
[1:43:54] When your heart was so pure before God,
[1:43:56] you didn't mind troubles. Ah, it's all
[1:43:59] right.
[1:44:01] How many of us can say that when
[1:44:02] troubles come? Ah, it's all right. Wow.
[1:44:06] Just let go on. But the first thing you
[1:44:08] know when you get that got that temper
[1:44:10] up and said, I'll get back at him, the
[1:44:15] dove took her flight.
[1:44:18] The Holy Spirit cannot stand nothing
[1:44:22] but gentleness.
[1:44:24] God's gentle and peace
[1:44:28] and loving. Remember that the next time
[1:44:30] the devil tries to get between you
[1:44:32] husbands and wives in your home.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; No, I know there ain't nobody here at
[1:44:38] Word of Life that's guilty of that. But
[1:44:40] there's some sorry outfits that stream
[1:44:42] our services, I reckon. And I'll say it
[1:44:44] for them you poor little darlings you
[1:44:46] put up with me for a few minute while I
[1:44:48] burn the high to them people out there
[1:44:50] that fuss at home.
[1:44:54] Uhhuh. Don't see that guilt as a hound
[1:44:56] dog in a hen house look on some of you.
[1:45:01] Oh my.
[1:45:03] Oh my.
[1:45:06] The Holy Spirit cannot stand nothing but
[1:45:08] gentleness. God's gentle and peace and
[1:45:10] loving. No matter how much you know, how
[1:45:13] much theology you know,
[1:45:15] and you can stick your chest out, you
[1:45:18] can preach,
[1:45:20] that doesn't mean nothing.
[1:45:26] Can you imagine a man that studies and
[1:45:28] prays and studies and prays and reads
[1:45:30] his Bible and preaches and preaches and
[1:45:31] preaches and preaches and yet God is
[1:45:35] it means nothing.
[1:45:38] He's wasted
[1:45:40] his life
[1:45:43] preaching,
[1:45:44] studying
[1:45:46] if God can't get that out of him.
[1:45:51] Yeah.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; If that gentle, quiet, loving spirit of
[1:45:56] God doesn't rest on you,
[1:45:59] it's all gone.
[1:46:04] You're nothing.
[1:46:07] No matter how many gifts you can show,
[1:46:09] Paul said, "Though I speak with tongues
[1:46:11] like men and angels, I could have faith
[1:46:12] to move mountains and not have that
[1:46:14] gentle, meek love, I am nothing." That's
[1:46:17] where your trouble lay. See,
[1:46:20] that's it.
[1:46:22] When you get saved, you was a lamb. When
[1:46:24] you got saved, excuse me, he was a lamb.
[1:46:26] But when you started snorting
[1:46:29] like the wolf and hating your neighbor
[1:46:31] and fussing and fighting, the dove just
[1:46:34] took her flight and went away from you.
[1:46:36] Now, you wonder what's the matter.
[1:46:38] That's what's the matter. If a dove
[1:46:40] won't stay on a goat, it won't stay on a
[1:46:43] wolf. Fussing, fighting, stewing, ups
[1:46:46] and downs, and arguing and
[1:46:48] denominational barriers.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit just took her flight.
[1:46:55] You say, "Brother Brandham, how do we
[1:46:56] get it back?"
[1:46:58] Just come back to a lamb.
[1:47:01] She just sitting there on the roost
[1:47:03] somewhere. She'll come right back when
[1:47:06] you take the nature of a lamb.
[1:47:10] So among birds, the ravenous birds are
[1:47:15] identified as those that persecute
[1:47:19] and devise evil against Christians. The
[1:47:23] Christians on the other hand are
[1:47:25] identified as doves, gentile.
[1:47:30] Among the beast, we have different
[1:47:34] beasts that are identified. Of course,
[1:47:36] Proverbs, Psalms also uses the lion.
[1:47:39] Yet, the lion also represents the Lord
[1:47:41] Jesus. But you got to keep people each
[1:47:43] one of them in his proper type.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; But when it come to identifying the Lord
[1:47:48] Jesus as receiving the spirit, it was
[1:47:51] not him receiving it as a lion, but
[1:47:54] rather as a lamb.
[1:47:56] So in the ravenous ripping, tearing,
[1:47:58] destroying, savagery nature of the lion
[1:48:02] does not identify the believer. Not that
[1:48:05] nature. Oh no. But what does a lamb a
[1:48:10] dove? Among plants, the wicked are
[1:48:14] identified as briars, thorns, nettles,
[1:48:19] thistles, darnell.
[1:48:23] But among the elect of God, oh hear me
[1:48:26] children, please hear me.
[1:48:29] Among the elect of God and the plant
[1:48:32] kingdom,
[1:48:34] they are identified as liies.
[1:48:39] Lilies, gentle, beautiful, yet they
[1:48:43] struggle for life. Pressing up through
[1:48:45] the mud, pressing up through the muck.
[1:48:48] Remember when he went walking in the
[1:48:50] Song of Solomon in his garden and he
[1:48:53] come to gather the liies.
[1:48:57] The liy's life s span is so short.
[1:49:00] It reaches the height of its beauty and
[1:49:04] only a few days
[1:49:07] and then taken.
[1:49:09] It doesn't bloom as often as others. It
[1:49:12] may not be as strong and its petals soft
[1:49:15] and gentle.
[1:49:19] He said he walked in the garden and he
[1:49:22] gathered the liies. Don't you see what
[1:49:23] the rapture is? The rapture is not
[1:49:25] gathering thorns. The rapture is not
[1:49:28] gathering wolves,
[1:49:30] briars, nettles.
[1:49:33] It's gathering doves,
[1:49:35] lambs,
[1:49:37] liies,
[1:49:41] liies.
[1:49:45] that you may be blameless, harmless, the
[1:49:47] sons of God, without rebuke, blameless
[1:49:51] that cannot be censored in the midst of
[1:49:53] a crooked and perverse,
[1:49:56] turn away, distort, turn aside, plot
[1:49:59] against the saving purposes
[1:50:02] of God.
[1:50:05] Let's bow our heads.
[1:50:13] Lord Jesus, help us today.
[1:50:18] Help us,
[1:50:24] Lord. I'm sure that
[1:50:28] I could say like others,
[1:50:30] no doubt there's times in my life I
[1:50:33] needed the prudence,
[1:50:35] I need the agility,
[1:50:39] the wisdom of a serpent to be able to
[1:50:41] avoid things. There's no doubt there's
[1:50:42] things I brought upon myself.
[1:50:46] My desire for truth, my desire to stand
[1:50:49] for what's right,
[1:50:52] but I left out wisdom.
[1:50:56] Forgive me, Lord.
[1:50:59] No doubt we've tried to hand handle
[1:51:01] battles
[1:51:03] under the wrong identification and the
[1:51:05] wrong type.
[1:51:08] We're never to handle our walk in life
[1:51:11] and the things we go through.
[1:51:15] Never to handle it like a wolf.
[1:51:19] Never to handle it like a braggard,
[1:51:21] arrogant, stuck on herself.
[1:51:27] We're never, Lord Jesus, called
[1:51:30] to be full of pride,
[1:51:34] but humble oursel.
[1:51:38] Oh Jesus, I pray begin here on the
[1:51:41] platform
[1:51:44] with the musicians,
[1:51:46] the pastor.
[1:51:50] Move down this
[1:51:52] building here today, Father.
[1:51:56] the front row, the second, the third,
[1:51:57] the fourth, on back, on back.
[1:52:01] Move up into the mezzanine,
[1:52:03] the different levels where people are
[1:52:05] sitting.
[1:52:08] Lord, move back into the nurseries where
[1:52:10] some of our sisters have their children.
[1:52:14] Move up into the sound booth, the first
[1:52:16] one there. Then Lord up into the second
[1:52:19] one and behind the glass
[1:52:22] the brother's father that's trying to
[1:52:24] make it possible for people to stream
[1:52:25] and all that
[1:52:28] but Lord I don't want them working up
[1:52:30] there every service every service. every
[1:52:32] service
[1:52:34] and so focus. It's a ministry. I know
[1:52:36] it's something they want to do to help.
[1:52:40] But Lord, I don't want them doing that
[1:52:42] and focusing so much on that they miss
[1:52:44] getting
[1:52:46] what you're speaking to us in this hour.
[1:52:50] No wonder you place brotherly kindness
[1:52:54] at the very last level, the seventh,
[1:52:57] before charity.
[1:52:59] No doubt that will be one of the most
[1:53:01] trying for us as the bride
[1:53:04] in the last day.
[1:53:07] As I deal with your people around the
[1:53:09] world and I hear the things they've been
[1:53:12] through and what they've suffered at the
[1:53:15] hand of message people and message
[1:53:18] preachers.
[1:53:20] Truly, it will be a marvel,
[1:53:23] Lord, that there will be a people that
[1:53:24] will come out of this age
[1:53:27] with a dove soul,
[1:53:30] a dove nature,
[1:53:32] a lily at heart,
[1:53:36] wisdom as we need it. Yes.
[1:53:38] But we never respond and react
[1:53:42] in anger because our human anger cannot
[1:53:46] mix with the nature of a dove.
[1:53:50] And if we've been around church very
[1:53:52] long, we've all heard preachers preach
[1:53:55] and it was it was out of their human
[1:53:56] anger. It's why there was something
[1:53:58] about it that just didn't seem right
[1:54:02] because the anointing does not want
[1:54:04] human anger. Sure, there's a wrath of
[1:54:07] God and anger of God.
[1:54:10] Same with the parents trying to correct
[1:54:12] their children.
[1:54:13] Help them Lord not to use human anger,
[1:54:17] human wrath,
[1:54:20] but they the spirit of God help them to
[1:54:22] correct their children and lead them in
[1:54:25] the right way. Lord,
[1:54:28] help the deacons. Father, they have a
[1:54:30] difficult position.
[1:54:33] Lord, they see somebody talking in
[1:54:35] church, they see different things, and
[1:54:37] they're policemen. That's what the
[1:54:38] prophet told us they were. But help them
[1:54:41] to always react, Lord,
[1:54:44] under the gentleness of the spirit of
[1:54:46] God. And it's amazing that gentleness
[1:54:49] can be firm and it can be strict to the
[1:54:52] point, but the bottom line is because
[1:54:56] they love the saints.
[1:54:59] Lord Jesus, help each of us. Father,
[1:55:03] you've sent us out as sheep among
[1:55:06] wolves. We've been attacked,
[1:55:10] Lord. We've been blooded.
[1:55:14] We've come to where we felt like we was
[1:55:15] within an inch of the loss of our life.
[1:55:21] And no doubt a lot of the things that
[1:55:23] happened was our own fault probably.
[1:55:26] But we're praying you'd help us today.
[1:55:29] Help us to never react with the
[1:55:31] vengeance and the hatred of a serpent.
[1:55:35] May we use his wisdom. And that's all.
[1:55:39] Never try to revenge ourselves and
[1:55:41] avenge ourselves. I will get back at
[1:55:44] them. No, Lord.
[1:55:48] As soon as we say that, the dove will
[1:55:50] just fly right away.
[1:55:55] I shared it with brother Tim and brother
[1:55:58] Ron this morning that your prophet said
[1:56:00] it in 1956
[1:56:04] that God is a lover
[1:56:07] and he's trying to get some of our
[1:56:10] starchy hearts
[1:56:12] to make love to.
[1:56:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:18] Oh Jesus, come near us today. Lord, if
[1:56:22] there's a sinner here today that needs
[1:56:24] to repent,
[1:56:26] may they feel that dove of the love of
[1:56:30] God gently fluttering over their hearts.
[1:56:34] May it convict them of their sins.
[1:56:38] Maybe there's a backslider here. May the
[1:56:41] dove of the Holy Ghost fly
[1:56:44] around them. May they hear it cooing,
[1:56:49] cooing,
[1:56:50] come back,
[1:56:52] come back.
[1:56:55] Maybe there's a Christian and they've
[1:56:56] just developed a bad attitude and Lord,
[1:56:59] they've got a grievance against a
[1:57:01] brother or sister.
[1:57:03] May they hear the voice of God couping
[1:57:05] to them. Forgive and you shall be
[1:57:08] forgiven.
[1:57:10] Pray for those who despitefully use you.
[1:57:13] Then may that gentleness of the spirit
[1:57:15] of God flutter all that bad feeling
[1:57:18] away.
[1:57:21] Granted, Lord God,
[1:57:23] we worship you today, Jesus.
[1:57:28] You love him with all your heart.
[1:57:29] Saints,
[1:57:31] just remain seated there if you'd like
[1:57:33] to, but would you lay your hand on the
[1:57:35] person sitting near you there?
[1:57:40] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:57:43] Many of you, I know, I know things that
[1:57:45] you've been through. I know different
[1:57:46] things that you've shared with me
[1:57:47] through the years. And it's a wonder to
[1:57:50] me that some of y'all even believe in
[1:57:51] preachers. It's a wonder to me that some
[1:57:54] of y'all even have desired to even go to
[1:57:56] church by the way you've been treated.
[1:58:00] But just because you've been treated bad
[1:58:02] and been abused by preachers don't mean
[1:58:04] that God still ain't got something
[1:58:05] that's true.
[1:58:07] You see, you need a dove preacher to be
[1:58:10] able to lead you to a dove life.
[1:58:13] So, if you've got a wolf in the pullpit,
[1:58:15] guess what you're going to produce in
[1:58:16] the pews? More wolves.
[1:58:21] I pray y'all will be honest with me and
[1:58:23] honest with yourself before God. If I
[1:58:27] ever get to a place that I can no longer
[1:58:29] feed you, if I can no longer help you,
[1:58:33] please,
[1:58:35] for the love of your own soul, for the
[1:58:37] love of your children, get somebody who
[1:58:40] will.
[1:58:42] You owe me nothing.
[1:58:44] I am sent to serve you, not you all
[1:58:48] serve me.
[1:58:51] If I ever get to a spot to where the
[1:58:53] love of God is not the dominant force in
[1:58:56] my life, I am no longer fit to stand in
[1:58:58] this pulpit.
[1:59:02] Please somebody, tell me,
[1:59:06] tell me.
[1:59:09] Lord Jesus, as we
[1:59:13] sat here in this solemn moment, Father,
[1:59:17] I pray you'd help us.
[1:59:23] Please, Father.
[1:59:26] May the spirit of God just move among
[1:59:28] us.
[1:59:31] Lord, I believe you put this on my heart
[1:59:33] today. And
[1:59:35] no doubt there will be folks who will be
[1:59:38] changed by your word and by your
[1:59:41] presence.
[1:59:44] Please Jesus help us in this battle
[1:59:49] Lord that we will be wise as serpents
[1:59:52] but never use his craftiness,
[1:59:56] never use his subtlety.
[2:00:01] But we'll learn how to escape danger
[2:00:04] that's not even ordained of you for us
[2:00:06] to go through.
[2:00:09] But overall, the dominant force of our
[2:00:11] life
[2:00:13] is your dove nature. I pray for my
[2:00:16] brothers and sisters today, Jesus.
[2:00:19] Not only those that are visible, but
[2:00:21] those that are stream, those that will
[2:00:22] archive the service. May the spirit of
[2:00:25] forgiveness
[2:00:27] just surge across this place today,
[2:00:29] Lord.
[2:00:32] I find it amazing that your prophet said
[2:00:34] that God heals by love. God heals by
[2:00:36] medicine. God heals by music.
[2:00:40] He said you take an old sore spot just
[2:00:44] something there and the love of God can
[2:00:46] come and you have something against a
[2:00:48] brother or sister and the spirit of God
[2:00:51] can come with love and bring healing to
[2:00:54] that. Would you grant it today, Lord?
[2:00:58] That does not make it to where that we
[2:01:00] don't want to deal with sin. Oh no, we
[2:01:03] want to deal with sin. But when it's
[2:01:05] dealt with and we want to go on and have
[2:01:08] the right attitude cuz which one among
[2:01:11] us today hasn't had need of forgiveness?
[2:01:16] Which one of us today,
[2:01:18] dear God, I say forgive us all. Forgive
[2:01:22] us of our failures. Forgive me, Lord, if
[2:01:26] ever I've in any way
[2:01:28] harmed any of your children.
[2:01:31] Lord, the places that I've traveled
[2:01:32] around the world, if I've ever reflected
[2:01:36] any behavior that was unbecoming
[2:01:39] to a son of God, if I've ever acted in
[2:01:42] any way in the pulpit, out of the
[2:01:44] pulpit, Lord God, I pray you'd forgive
[2:01:48] me. Then, Father, I in turn pray for
[2:01:51] these sheep if they've ever acted in any
[2:01:55] way that was displeasing to you. Would
[2:01:58] you forgive us, Lord? Help us to leave
[2:02:01] this service today with a greater desire
[2:02:04] to me be more doveike
[2:02:07] than we've ever had in our entire life.
[2:02:10] Because truly, we want to be godly. Not
[2:02:15] just on the outside, but from the inside
[2:02:19] working its way out.
[2:02:22] Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:24] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:26] Can we stand our feet, saints?
[2:02:32] Now, let's not break this moment, this
[2:02:34] this atmosphere.
[2:02:36] I know a lot of folks may not really
[2:02:38] like this type of atmosphere, but when
[2:02:40] you go to shripport in 1965 and you find
[2:02:43] Brother Brandham preaching the different
[2:02:44] sermons there and they had a somber,
[2:02:47] real somber type of service and they was
[2:02:50] Pentecostals. They was a Pentecostal
[2:02:52] church, Jack Moore, but they wasn't
[2:02:53] running, shouting and all that and we
[2:02:55] believe in that too. But yet the prophet
[2:02:58] told them these are the types of
[2:03:00] services that we need to set in. And
[2:03:03] remember it was there that he preached
[2:03:06] the sermon on the wings
[2:03:09] of a dove.
[2:03:11] And he waited his whole life to see that
[2:03:15] seventh dove. And when did he see it?
[2:03:21] Just a couple of months before he was
[2:03:24] taken from the earth.
[2:03:28] May God help us. He wasn't looking just
[2:03:30] for another eagle, but he's looking for
[2:03:33] the white eagle. He had already saw
[2:03:34] that. It was across his chest, remember,
[2:03:37] on the stone,
[2:03:39] but he wasn't looking for a seventh
[2:03:41] eagle or an eighth eagle, but for a
[2:03:43] seventh dove.
[2:03:47] Oh, praise the Lord. Come and just take
[2:03:49] a few minutes before we go. I know
[2:03:50] you're probably hungry and you got lunch
[2:03:51] plans and this and that and other, but
[2:03:53] I'll tell you one thing. You ain't got a
[2:03:54] greater plan than the plan of God for us
[2:03:57] to be together right now.
[2:03:59] Don't you love him?
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be doveike? How many
[2:04:03] wants to be wise as a serpent? I know it
[2:04:05] seems odd to ask you that, but these are
[2:04:07] the words of the Lord Jesus
[2:04:10] on the wings of a dove.
[2:04:13] Praise the Lord. Let's just worship him
[2:04:15] together now. Just let the Holy Ghost be
[2:04:18] able to search our hearts and look down
[2:04:20] every avenue of our life and make sure
[2:04:22] that you're not overlooking something
[2:04:24] that he's there to help us with today.
[2:04:27] Sing it for us. Delicious worship
[2:04:29] together.
[2:04:30] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:04:33] On the wings of the snow,
[2:04:38] wide
[2:04:40] Jesus, help us, Lord.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; God sends his pure,
[2:04:45] sweet
[2:04:47] love, a sign from above.
[2:04:56] On the wings of the dove.
[2:05:03] On the wings of a snow
[2:05:07] white.
[2:05:11] God sends his pure
[2:05:14] sweet.
[2:05:17] A sign from above.
[2:05:24] on the wings of D.
[2:05:31] And over had drifted
[2:05:38] on the flood many days.
[2:05:45] He searched for landing
[2:05:52] in various
[2:05:54] ways.
[2:05:59] Troubles he had
[2:06:03] some
[2:06:06] but not from above.
[2:06:12] God gave him a sign
[2:06:19] on the wings of a dove.
[2:06:26] On the wings of the snow
[2:06:30] white,
[2:06:34] God send his pure
[2:06:37] sweet
[2:06:39] love a sign from above.
[2:06:47] On the wings of a dove.
[2:06:53] On the wings of snow
[2:06:58] white,
[2:07:01] God send his pure
[2:07:04] sweet
[2:07:06] love a sign from above
[2:07:13] on the wings of above.
[2:07:21] Jesus our savior
[2:07:27] came to earth one day.
[2:07:33] He was born in a stable
[2:07:40] in a manger of h.
[2:07:48] Oh, here he rejected
[2:07:54] but not from above.
[2:08:00] God gave us a son.
[2:08:07] On the wings of a dove.
[2:08:13] On the wings of a snow.
[2:08:17] Why
[2:08:19] does
[2:08:20] God send his pure
[2:08:24] sweet
[2:08:25] love a sign from above
[2:08:33] on the wings of a dove?
[2:08:39] Oh, on the wings of a snow.
[2:08:44] Why does
[2:08:47] God send his pure
[2:08:50] sweet
[2:08:51] love a sign from above
[2:08:59] on the wings of a dove?
[2:09:05] On the wings of the snow
[2:09:09] white,
[2:09:12] God sent his pure
[2:09:16] sweet love this time from above
[2:09:25] on the wings of a dove.
[2:09:32] Though I have suffered
[2:09:37] in many ways
[2:09:44] I cried for healing
[2:09:50] both night and day.
[2:09:56] Faith wasn't forgotten
[2:10:03] by the father above.
[2:10:09] He gave me his son.
[2:10:15] On the wings of a dove.
[2:10:22] On the wings of snow.
[2:10:26] Why
[2:10:29] God sending his pure
[2:10:32] sweet
[2:10:33] love aside from above.
[2:10:41] On the wings of a dove.
[2:10:47] On the wings of a snow
[2:10:51] white.
[2:10:54] God send his pure
[2:10:57] sweet
[2:10:58] love a
[2:11:06] on the wings of
[2:11:12] oh on the wings of the snow
[2:11:19] God in his pure
[2:11:22] Read love, a sign from above
[2:11:31] on the wings of above.
[2:11:44] Thou,
[2:11:46] oh Lord,
[2:11:49] are a shield
[2:11:51] for me.
[2:11:54] You're the glory
[2:11:56] and the lifter of my head.

[2:12:42] Many there be would say
[2:12:46] of my soul,
[2:12:52] there is no help for you in God.
[2:13:02] I cried unto the Lord with my voice.
[2:13:09] He heard me
[2:13:12] out of his holy
[2:13:15] hill
[2:13:20] laid me down and I slept
