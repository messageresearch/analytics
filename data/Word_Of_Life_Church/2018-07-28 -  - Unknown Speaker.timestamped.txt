[0:00] you imagine how discouraging that would
[0:02] have been for Jesus these preachers is
[0:05] gonna take the message and go along with
[0:06] it and they're fussing and fighting over
[0:08] who gets to set him a ride in and who
[0:10] gets a set at my left hand he allowed
[0:13] himself as a human to feel that to
[0:17] succumb to that this is the sonship this
[0:20] is the sonship a mares to feel
[0:24] discouraged and they why should I even
[0:27] do it I guarantee you there in the
[0:30] musician on this platform a singer in
[0:33] this church a song later a preacher than
[0:38] they have ever been so despondent
[0:39] deacons Sunday school leaders librarian

[0:46] go in or not clean the church and I pick
[0:48] up the church and people do this and
[0:50] another I'm quitting the guys on the
[0:57] sound booth how many times did you tell
[1:00] them you appreciate them when the
[1:01] service goes well but how many times
[1:04] they you crank that head of yours around
[1:06] that one something goes wrong they don't
[1:14] reach sign language I can tell you that
[1:16] right now
[1:18] you'll come in here and set ten or
[1:20] fifteen services whatever it is and
[1:22] everything will go smooth and you never
[1:23] walk by to say thank you I appreciate
[1:27] you sacrificing to set back here make it
[1:29] comfortable for us what do you say
[1:33] friends it's our tendency to complain
[1:35] and not be grateful and Satan uses them
[1:40] complaints on everybody and their
[1:42] brother to bring them even farther down
[1:45] and their discouragement so what do
[1:48] y'all figure so we just talk lit well I
[1:52] say when I when reacting you for me but
[1:59] I just thought I'd throw myself on the
[2:01] same pot if every one of you said you
[2:05] was I have to say I'm sorry
[2:08] I love you but I'm going on
[2:13] and they feels that way I'm going on did
[2:16] get discourage fella done I did you get
[2:18] despondent I do but I'm going on anyway
[2:21] I'm going on and a matter of fact I'm
[2:26] happy going that way I said I'm happy
[2:29] going that way hey hey man I want as
[2:32] much happiness as I can be able to stand
[2:33] that's exactly right
[2:35] I want to be a happy child of God not
[2:37] just when I get to heaven but on my
[2:40] journey
