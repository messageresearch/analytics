[31:16] 1 whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[31:22] Christ is born of God and every one that
[31:26] loveth him that begat loveth him also
[31:28] that is begotten of him by this we know
[31:32] that we love the children of God when we
[31:36] love God and keep his Commandments for
[31:43] this is the love of God that we keep his
[31:47] Commandments and His commandments are
[31:51] not Grievous and the church said for
[31:58] this is the love of God that we keep his
[32:00] Commandments and His commandments are
[32:02] not Grievous how in the world can a man
[32:04] say this based on the love of God that's
[32:09] the whole key this is the love of God
[32:11] when it comes into a person's heart that
[32:14] keep his Commandments and the
[32:16] commandments are not Grievous after
[32:19] trying to it on their own that's a total
[32:21] different story now well this is the
[32:23] love of God that would keep his
[32:25] Commandments and His commandments are
[32:26] not Grievous for whatsoever is born of
[32:30] God overcometh the world and this is the
[32:34] victory that overcometh the world even
[32:37] our face a man-bag hits it together
[32:42] tonight with me in prayer if you would
[32:44] have me like to be remember before the
[32:45] Lord just raise your hand god Bless You
[32:48] Heavenly Father we love you tonight we

[32:53] your great presence or Jesus we counted
[32:57] a privilege father that we can be called
[32:59] your children Lord to be able to
[33:02] assemble ourselves together again
[33:04] tonight we're so thankful we're grateful
[33:07] that we have a place where we
[33:08] can come still thankful Lord to be able
[33:12] to live in a nation thus far well we can
[33:15] have this freedom we are grateful Lord
[33:18] Jesus we don't want to ever take take
[33:21] advantage of it or do it without being
[33:23] thankful in our hearts as we approach it
[33:26] tuned out Lord each of us have needs
[33:28] you saw hundreds of hands went up before
[33:30] you before we bowed our heads
[33:32] you know what laid beneath each hand
[33:35] maybe a child maybe a husband a
[33:38] financial need a physical need something
[33:41] in this service that they need you alone
[33:43] know every heart I pray that you would
[33:46] help us Lord as we come to this portion
[33:49] of the service I certainly need your
[33:51] help
[33:51] Oh Lord God - for a man to stand up and
[33:54] to try to preach you know it's it's it's
[33:57] a phenomenal thing it's an amazing thing
[34:00] that a man can study it by inspiration
[34:02] build a fault
[34:04] try to put things together and order
[34:06] convey something to the people but it
[34:09] takes you Lord to move in a supernatural
[34:10] way to help us we're looking for that to
[34:13] happen this very night Lord speak to us
[34:16] you're a great Rhema word we ask in
[34:19] Jesus name and the Saints said god bless
[34:23] you you may be seated
[34:27] I'd like to speak to you tonight and get
[34:32] this microphone fixed here
[34:34] on learn of me learn of me we want to go
[34:42] back to Matthew chapter 11 verse 28 what
[34:46] we closed out with last week we want to
[34:50] pick up with Jesus dealing with the same
[34:52] thought of the commandments of God not
[34:54] being Grievous
[34:55] now I realized - an unconverted heart
[34:58] even to someone who intellectually knows
[35:00] where you're coming from and knows what
[35:02] you're talking about yet spiritually
[35:04] they never experienced that they'll
[35:06] really struggle with these things
[35:07] because to them the commandments of God
[35:10] the things that God requires of their
[35:12] life or of others they find it very very
[35:14] hard to do and maybe they'll look at
[35:16] others and say that's not fair that is
[35:19] just not right God would demand this and
[35:21] God would demand
[35:22] well you realize when people are saying
[35:24] that either their walk with God is not
[35:26] where it needs to be or they've got
[35:28] broken fellowship with God sometimes a
[35:30] person can get out of fellowship and
[35:31] actually know better but yet for many
[35:33] people saying that consistently
[35:35] habitually over and over again it's
[35:37] really a lack of a new verse because if
[35:40] the Spirit of God in our hearts would
[35:42] would they totally and completely agree
[35:44] with every word that God said that he
[35:47] would impart to us the ability to be
[35:48] able to live it now let's look here at
[35:50] the words of the Lord Jesus in Matthew
[35:52] chapter 11 verse 28 he says come unto me
[35:54] all ye that Labour and are heavy laden
[35:57] and I will give you rest take my yoke
[36:00] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[36:04] and lowly and heart and you shall find
[36:07] rest unto your souls now there's many
[36:10] things about the Lord Jesus many great
[36:13] attributes about the Lord Jesus that are
[36:15] so wonderful and so magnificent about
[36:18] his character and the way that he was
[36:20] even when he was here on the earth never
[36:22] a person that ever lived like him and
[36:24] none that ever will but yet for him to
[36:27] say this and point out these particular
[36:30] points about his character it must be a
[36:33] revelant that will have have some sort
[36:36] of impact upon our lives as children of
[36:39] God because we know that it's much more
[36:41] about the Lord Jesus and meekness and
[36:43] the ability you know whenever he stood
[36:45] that time at the temple and they turned
[36:47] the temple into a place of trading and
[36:49] there was buying and selling and
[36:51] exchanging money and the Lord Jesus
[36:52] takes the courts and puts it together
[36:54] and runs the people out of there why
[36:56] didn't you tell us to be longtime now
[36:59] why didn't you tell us to look over in
[37:00] st. John 8:44 and every time a preacher
[37:02] preaches said you're of your father the
[37:04] devil because that ain't the truth that
[37:06] doesn't always apply in every situation
[37:08] so why would Jesus point out that were
[37:11] to learn of him that he is meek and
[37:14] lowly now do we need to be bold at times
[37:16] we do do we need to rebuke your time so
[37:19] we certainly do do we need to be
[37:20] straightforward and even what some
[37:22] people would would consider to be hearts
[37:24] we do but there is a time to be harsh
[37:27] and there is a time to be humble and
[37:29] there's a time for all things in the
[37:31] administration of it but why would Jesus
[37:34] focus on the
[37:35] characteristics in order to help us to
[37:38] be burden bears and to take our yoke
[37:40] now he knows exactly which
[37:42] characteristics will help further the
[37:44] cause of God and help further the yoke
[37:47] bearing to make it more simple and make
[37:50] us where we can be more surrender now
[37:52] you realize that being stubborn being
[37:54] hard-headed even being bold and brazen
[37:57] sometimes that will not help you in
[37:59] bearing your yoke and you understand
[38:02] that being harsh and being all that sort
[38:04] of mentality and attitude that we can
[38:06] have that will not help your yoke that
[38:08] will make your yoke more difficult and
[38:11] more hard to bear so Jesus picks the
[38:13] attributes or the characteristics that
[38:16] would help each child of God to be a
[38:18] better yoke bearer and to help them to
[38:21] come to a spot where they can say this
[38:23] is not hard to do as a matter of fact I
[38:26] found this easier being a Christian it's
[38:28] much easier than it ever was when I was
[38:31] a sinner now if you don't feel that way
[38:34] you need to go on with God and get a
[38:35] deeper Walker's gone now why would he
[38:38] pick these attributes because in these
[38:40] attributes lays the very epitome of his
[38:43] own life never member of theirs as I
[38:46] said there's a time to review and
[38:47] there's a time to chastise and chasing
[38:50] and there's times that preachers have to
[38:52] say public things as Paul spoke to that
[38:54] Jesus spoke about it but yet for us to
[38:57] live and work in that room now you have
[38:59] to take my word for this because you
[39:01] don't know my heart and there's many
[39:03] things that I have to preach it's been
[39:04] very difficult through the years but
[39:06] only God knows how painful and my family
[39:09] this close to me how painful it is for
[39:11] me to have to preach hard and to say
[39:14] harsh thing I don't enjoy that it works
[39:16] so against my human makeup in my nature
[39:19] I'm not a harsh person I'm not a rough
[39:21] person never have been so people who
[39:23] don't know you they think ah he enjoys
[39:25] that you're a million miles from the
[39:27] truth but there are some that apparently
[39:30] do because that's the only way they know
[39:31] how to preach the only way they know how
[39:32] to live but this is not the way that
[39:34] will help you to come into a spot to
[39:37] where you can bury the yoke of the Lord
[39:39] Jesus now a man who really wants to
[39:41] preach I preached art God more than
[39:43] likable never even in a great capacity
[39:45] and you'll never be able to really
[39:47] rebuke in a very big area because he
[39:50] enjoys doing it God never got men in the
[39:53] Old Testament that was out to get the
[39:55] child Diaz or the Babylonians who got
[39:57] men who didn't want to do it that way if
[39:59] they would know it was God making them
[40:01] do it instead of them men having a
[40:03] personal agenda you think the Lord Jesus
[40:06] was a mean person you think the Lord
[40:08] Jesus was harsh and that Jesus was rash
[40:11] as far as being hateful and contrary of
[40:14] course not he was not that way at all
[40:15] and yet sure he displays this to us and
[40:18] he said take my yoke upon you and learn
[40:20] of me for I am meek and lowly in heart
[40:24] and you shall find rest to yourself so
[40:27] first of all he asked us to come to him
[40:30] because we certainly cannot bear the
[40:32] yoke unless we come to him first so he
[40:34] gives us the divine approach come unto
[40:37] me all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[40:39] and laden and I will give you rest so
[40:41] there is a release after we come to him
[40:44] he releases us from the yoke of sin and
[40:46] then he offers us an exchange of yo so
[40:50] then he tells us that in order for us to
[40:52] go on now from the release of that yoke
[40:55] there is a way there are steps about
[40:58] which we must come to him so we've got
[41:00] to come to Christ but then the next step
[41:02] is there must be a submission in order
[41:05] for the peace of God to be released in
[41:07] order to become a real disciple which is
[41:10] a follower of God now it says once you
[41:13] do that I want you to learn of me so we
[41:16] don't learn of him just my hearing
[41:18] preaching we don't learn of him just by
[41:21] reading the word now there is a truth to
[41:24] that intellectually we learn about him
[41:26] by reading about by the way done things
[41:28] and we learn by going to church and we
[41:30] learn by listening to prophets tapes and
[41:32] we learn by reading the books but yet
[41:34] here is a learn that is a different type
[41:37] of learn than the intellectual
[41:39] conception it is a learning by
[41:42] submission which you'll in turn will
[41:44] bring a divine experience now a person
[41:47] could learn about the characteristics of
[41:49] cross they could set under the ministry
[41:51] or the real son of God a real son of God
[41:54] which is called you'll be able to study
[41:56] the logos they will hear that
[41:58] God study the logos and bring the logos
[42:00] together they will set there and
[42:01] actually hear the Rhema though it won't
[42:03] be Rhema to them but they'll set down
[42:05] here that men of God as he's bringing
[42:07] that Rhema so they're scepter and they
[42:09] hear and they learn that intellectually
[42:11] and that all my Christ is this and he's
[42:13] this and he's this and they can break it
[42:15] down in all the categories and he's love
[42:17] and His mercy and he's on and on and on
[42:19] long and they are learning about him but
[42:22] they're not actually being conformed to
[42:24] that image which can only come by divine
[42:27] something working in their life now many
[42:31] people around the message have learned
[42:32] that God sent a prophet and they've
[42:34] learned about many signs and wonders and
[42:36] vindication but apparently many of them
[42:39] never had a revelation of who he was or
[42:41] they shouldn't be pulling away the way
[42:43] they are today so it's a parent now that
[42:45] a person can learn about holiness they
[42:47] could learn about Jesus they can learn
[42:49] even learn about the attributes of him
[42:52] being lit meek and lowly and he was
[42:54] humble he did not retaliate and he did
[42:57] not come against those who come against
[42:58] him but he held his peace and pray for
[43:00] them so they could learn all of that
[43:02] intellectually but then when that same
[43:04] thing would arise in their life they
[43:07] would never find the power of God
[43:08] released to them to help them do it now
[43:11] they'll hear it in the cell I know I
[43:13] shouldn't do that I know I should but I
[43:15] can't help it now you see what's
[43:16] happening they are learning about him
[43:18] they are learning what they should do
[43:20] hearing it intellectually but the
[43:22] intellectual power never the
[43:24] intellectual sharing ability will never
[43:26] release said them to power to help them
[43:29] do it now Jesus not only knew who he was
[43:33] but by knowing that by gnosis he had
[43:35] noted the Greek word gnosis so it was
[43:37] more than learning it intellectually
[43:39] that he had learned it by experience it
[43:42] released to him the power to help him
[43:44] fulfill what God wanted to do I don't
[43:46] want to just know the word by knowledge
[43:48] I don't want to know it in such a way
[43:50] that when I come to a further
[43:52] understanding of the word that that word
[43:55] releases to me a power or a Dunamis out
[43:58] of that word that helps me to live what
[44:01] I've learned if not I'm going to be more
[44:03] miserable because now I know I shouldn't
[44:05] do that and
[44:06] and that ain't got no power to help me
[44:08] do it but if that word becomes a reality
[44:10] it releases a power to you and to me to
[44:14] help me do what you and I cannot do
[44:16] aren't you grateful for that
[44:18] now what Jesus says learned of me all
[44:22] right Lord Jesus want what do you want
[44:23] me to learn now watch what he says I am
[44:25] meek and lowly in heart so the meekness
[44:29] and the humility the loneliness of
[44:32] Christ now what it appears and his
[44:35] assumption of human nature
[44:37] now what's learned of me watch me watch
[44:40] me look at me and learn of me if you
[44:44] want to bear your yoke without grumbling
[44:46] and complaining and fussing and argument
[44:50] and being at the mean temperent then
[44:51] learn of me now watch so then this was
[44:54] achieved in him by assuming the human
[44:58] nature laying aside all of the great
[45:00] splendor and the grandeur that he was in
[45:02] heaven and he assumed the human nature
[45:04] to come down on the earth and to be
[45:06] called everything on the world that's
[45:08] imaginable then it was also reflected in
[45:11] that he took on himself the obedience to
[45:14] the father's ever come in you ever think
[45:16] why did the Lord Jesus had to be
[45:17] baptized
[45:20] did anybody preach in all the call and
[45:22] Jesus got saved and said well the next
[45:24] thing didn't I've got to get baptized
[45:26] why did Jesus get that ties he was
[45:29] showing submission to the present tense
[45:33] troops there was no need for him
[45:36] personally to be baptized only other
[45:39] than John was there and John had the
[45:41] message of the day and the people were
[45:44] showing their submission to that message
[45:46] to be baptized so in symbol form what
[45:49] was that all you said didn't mean I said
[45:51] it did mean something
[45:52] it was displaying his meekness and his
[45:55] loneliness to the to the command of God
[45:58] for that hour praise the Lord
[46:00] do you understand it Jesus would have
[46:02] lived in this day then you would have
[46:05] found Jesus walking according to the
[46:07] message of this hour
[46:09] if he would have lived in the days of
[46:11] looser Alessia whatever more he would
[46:13] have found in why it was a submission to
[46:15] God this is what he wants us to learn of
[46:18] you learn of me
[46:20] so you can take this yoke upon you and
[46:22] you'll find my burdens are not heavy and
[46:24] cumbersome you'll find out that it is
[46:26] light any child of God that's truly born
[46:29] again if you can't say it there's
[46:31] something wrong with you that it's much
[46:32] easier being a Christian now the devil
[46:34] was living for the devil all brother
[46:37] Donnie you don't even know you said it
[46:38] last week you never got drunk that's
[46:40] exactly right well Brooke let me tell
[46:42] you brother Donnie how it feels to be
[46:44] drunk know what I want you to tell me is
[46:46] how does it feel to have a hangover I
[46:48] want you to tell me how your head feels
[46:51] I want you to open up your wallet and
[46:53] tell me how much you spend for that good
[46:55] feeling or not before and tell me how
[46:57] you're going to pay your light bill
[46:58] don't tell me how cocaine feels when
[47:01] you're up on it tell me how it feels
[47:02] when you can't get it tell me how it
[47:05] feels to sell your body in order to get
[47:07] it here don't tell me about the thrill
[47:09] tell me about the reality of the
[47:11] downside don't tell me oh I'm so free
[47:14] I'm so free don't tell me about that I
[47:16] want to know how that condemnation feels
[47:18] in your heart when you break the word
[47:20] that's what I want to know praise the
[47:25] Lord don't paint me the poster of the
[47:27] Marlboro Man centered upon the back of a
[47:30] horse and this leather vest on a big
[47:32] leather saddle don't give me that let me
[47:34] see the Marlboro Man laying in the ER
[47:37] when cancer is HEDIS lungs out and he
[47:39] can't breathe praise the Lord
[47:43] oh my notice his conversation among the
[47:48] people every day walk that he had what
[47:51] was it it was an absolute submission to
[47:53] the divine will of the father tells us I
[47:55] never come to do my will but the will of
[47:58] the Father so there is no coming to him
[48:00] of course until we know taking the yoke
[48:03] until we come down then actually come to
[48:05] him there's no way we can move to the
[48:08] second stage of rest real divine rest
[48:10] until we learn of him and then take his
[48:13] yoke upon us now notice that for a
[48:15] person to believe that in the
[48:17] - a man I know it's true I know churches
[48:20] oh god I want to do it I want to do it
[48:22] yet they never learn how to submit it
[48:24] very very sad
[48:26] what's this Jesus says take my yoke upon
[48:28] you and learn of me now I notice learn
[48:32] of me don't go to the church don't learn
[48:35] the prophets don't learn to the pastor
[48:37] don't loans just sell the doctrines but
[48:38] learn of me so it will help you to be
[48:42] like me how many wants to be like him
[48:46] walking on water so what you want
[48:48] placing the dead here on the sick
[48:50] planting ropes rub people out what you
[48:53] want what do you want you want to be
[48:56] like him what do you want to be like it
[49:01] praise the Lord
[49:03] now watch he says learn of me for I am
[49:06] meek and lowly so I want you tonight if
[49:10] we're going to this I want you to ask
[49:11] this I'm going to ask Lord what do I
[49:15] need to learn a few teach me what do I
[49:20] need to learn because I want to be a
[49:21] real servant learn of me for I am meek
[49:25] and lowly and Hart now these are the
[49:29] graces that must be cultivated in the
[49:33] life of a child of God in order for them
[49:35] to be completely surrendered to what the
[49:37] Lord wants them to be now notice this I
[49:39] found this meaning of meekness I thought
[49:41] is absolutely wonderful
[49:42] meekness is the strength of the man who
[49:45] can rule his own spirit under
[49:48] provocation subduing resentment under
[49:52] wrong refusing to retaliate now learn of
[49:58] me for I am meek and lowly now what's
[50:02] this when Jesus rebukes the Pharisees it
[50:06] is not in retaliation when Jesus rebukes
[50:10] the scribes and the Essenes and all the
[50:12] different ones and it's not out of
[50:14] retaliation because they have done
[50:17] something to him come on church he is
[50:20] not getting back at him Jesus was not a
[50:23] pulpit bully that he was taking the
[50:26] pulpit in order to
[50:27] satella score Jesus was not using the
[50:31] pulpit as a means to get back into
[50:33] people he was not retaliating against
[50:35] them and I know there's many many
[50:37] examples in the world tour people has
[50:40] leaned that way and I said we'll look at
[50:41] this and look at that look at that yeah
[50:43] look at the whole setting of its own
[50:45] Jesus was not up there preaching and
[50:47] getting back at them you hurt my
[50:49] feelings I'm gonna burn you up in that
[50:51] service buddy I'm gonna preach all over
[50:53] you that man don't even have the right
[50:54] attitude to be on the pulpit not till he
[50:57] gets nothing off of it the pulpit is not
[50:59] to be used as something to settle a
[51:01] score come on church so Jesus was not
[51:04] retaliating against those people I Peter
[51:07] keep a record of all their souls so said
[51:09] some so next time I get out boy I'll lay
[51:11] it on and that's not what Jesus was
[51:12] doing it for that would have not been
[51:14] the example that could have ever died on
[51:17] the cross for us
[51:18] so he says learn of me for I am meek and
[51:21] lowly let me share this with you again
[51:23] meekness is the strength of the man who
[51:26] can rule his own spirit under
[51:29] provocation subduing resentment under
[51:33] wrong refusing to retaliate
[51:37] now don't raise your hands but how many
[51:39] of you can do that oh ma if we take a
[51:48] lot of the retaliation off the Facebook
[51:50] things I'm not sure what there'd be to
[51:52] say anymore everybody's pulpit Facebook
[52:00] well Gloria I'm more interested in name
[52:04] book my name on the book and stay in
[52:08] there and stay in there now watch one he
[52:13] was reviled he didn't revile again
[52:16] notice Jesus whenever he gets under
[52:18] pressure notice when they get ready to
[52:21] take him and crucify him and beat him
[52:24] and all of that there is not one side
[52:26] not one even one display in all of the
[52:31] four Gospels of the same way that he
[52:34] preached John 8:44 year of your father
[52:36] the devil there is not
[52:39] little display of the same attitude like
[52:42] it was why so-so
[52:44] had it been said then had he'll preached
[52:47] that message in st. John a you have your
[52:49] father the devil the reason you don't
[52:51] hear my word because my warning got no
[52:53] place in you it could have been
[52:54] perceived it was retaliation because
[52:57] they were coming against and so God has
[52:59] him to say way beforehand and then
[53:03] whenever they come to get him instead of
[53:05] you know casting out my hole down into
[53:07] hell
[53:08] when Malthus has several ear was cut off
[53:10] and now those losses here what did Jesus
[53:12] do rates right down stuck it back on the
[53:14] side of his head and healed him my
[53:17] Dennis and citizen you're of your father
[53:19] the devil let your head bleeding righto
[53:21] why didn't he displayed a cuz that's
[53:23] what Peter was displaying amen what was
[53:27] Peter do and Peter was showing a message
[53:29] person without the Holy Ghost the way
[53:31] they respond they retaliate with the
[53:34] sword
[53:37] grace hello enough Peter was a good guy
[53:39] and he meant well but the means he was
[53:41] using wasn't well praise the Lord he was
[53:44] retaliation said don't do that Peter
[53:46] so Jesus had to undo what Peter done
[53:49] thank God for mercy so when he comes now
[53:52] under his great strength and city of
[53:54] Jesus retaliating or saying something
[53:56] that would be sharp and harsh and we
[53:58] know that he said many things that could
[54:00] have been taken that one but a shock he
[54:02] totally takes on a different demeanor he
[54:06] now moves into another face what was it
[54:08] the Lamb of God is fixin to be
[54:12] sacrificed as he walks in the temple he
[54:15] looks around and he looked on him as
[54:17] anger that's the prophet when I rebuked
[54:22] some boxcars prophet
[54:26] and now he's going to the cross he's not
[54:28] going to do it in the office of a
[54:29] prophet he's going to the office of a
[54:32] lamb praise the Lord
[54:35] now we know this message can be that way
[54:38] it come from a prophet it can make us
[54:41] all prophetic already talented people
[54:46] but that something attribute Jesus is
[54:49] coming for in the marriage supper if
[54:52] that's so would all be sent out the
[54:53] table fussing and fighting over who got
[54:55] sitting closer to Jesus than you did you
[54:58] know what that's not what's going in the
[54:59] marriage of the Lamb it must man be an
[55:01] attitude I done date show that will
[55:04] match his very own is that right I don't
[55:06] get quite on me already children now
[55:10] watch so meekness is the opposite of
[55:13] self will now watch what meekness will
[55:17] do whenever he was spoken against and
[55:20] her sings and lies and fabrication and
[55:22] they still going to lie after lie after
[55:25] lie why didn't Jesus set up and take a
[55:27] sermon on that law and another sermon on
[55:30] that way and another sermon on that line
[55:32] another sermon on that law and cities
[55:35] just stood there and held his peace as
[55:38] if though he was totally guilty this was
[55:45] not the time to preach such a sermon it
[55:49] was the time to not even act like you
[55:51] were retaliatory but submissive um meek
[55:56] as a lamb that disorder
[56:01] praise the Lord no one says Paul in
[56:04] second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1
[56:06] now I Paul myself beseech you by the
[56:11] meekness and gentleness of Christ on
[56:16] what grounds
[56:18] does this man have to beseech him as if
[56:22] though he had tapped into the very
[56:25] nature of God he didn't say my
[56:30] gentleness of mind meekness but I
[56:32] beseech you on the furring meekness and
[56:35] gentleness of Christ himself
[56:38] Lord God grant today that we as message
[56:41] folks in reality can say that I beseech
[56:44] you I beseech you not by my chilliness
[56:46] it runs out not the mom meekness it runs
[56:49] out but by the meekness of Christ which
[56:51] has known the gentleness of Christ which
[56:54] has no end
[56:55] oh thank God no one says so meekness is
[56:59] the opposite of self-will so loneliness
[57:02] then would be the opposite or the
[57:04] reverse of self-esteem now what's so
[57:08] meekness is going to be the opposite of
[57:10] self well loneliness will be the
[57:12] opposite of self-esteem which we're all
[57:14] born to esteem ourselves we're born this
[57:18] way into the world and many of us do
[57:20] today the very reason we fight such
[57:22] battles we think it's trials of her
[57:24] faith any trials of our faith it's our
[57:26] still our own rotten human makeup
[57:30] we're so set in our ways and we're so
[57:32] this is ridin re riding anybody crosses
[57:35] and sex what causes a lot of our
[57:36] problems if you can only say really what
[57:39] our trials of your face you'd probably
[57:41] surprised how few they are please mother
[57:46] darling thank you sir I'm going to oh ma
[57:52] now notices Jesus and Matthew chapter 20
[57:55] verse 27 whosoever will be chief first
[58:01] in ranked first in influence first and
[58:05] honor whosoever will be chief among you
[58:10] let him be your servant the problem is
[58:17] we got too many chiefs and nobody wants
[58:19] to be the servants we got the chief at
[58:24] the higher department chief of the dress
[58:26] Department the chief of the thermostat
[58:28] department and the chief of the carpet
[58:29] color department we got the chief of the
[58:31] pasture problem and we got the chief for
[58:32] how long the freaks are to preach and
[58:34] watch the preacher all to come and I
[58:35] don't like this preaching I don't
[58:37] achieve so we got a lot of Chiefs the
[58:40] first in rank you cost their opinion
[58:43] Betty they'll let they'll send up a
[58:44] signal signal to you know let you know
[58:46] you know get away from me get away from
[58:48] me you crossed me exactly is what I'm
[58:50] called to do crossed us all to make us
[58:53] what humble submissive and realize God
[58:56] don't work his whole plan around us
[58:58] we're to work our whole life around his
[59:01] plan now once your Jesus speaking about
[59:05] even those in position and authority
[59:07] intima seasoning in tomato they summon
[59:10] in the new administration of the body
[59:12] that the man who's actually going to be
[59:15] the leaders Oh verse 20 even as the Son
[59:21] of man came not to be ministered unto
[59:26] but to minister Deacon all which is a
[59:32] Greek word we get deacon from
[59:37] supply food to help the necessities so
[59:41] in Jesus was here he did not come to be
[59:44] ministered to rather to minister to
[59:48] learn of me learn of me although that
[59:53] only the same very deep I know it ain't
[59:55] but it's all for good I think to get us
[59:59] out of here my my I know I need seven
[1:00:02] thunders and third told and great deep
[1:00:04] profound things that nobody can
[1:00:05] understand that's why you so quiet you
[1:00:07] understand it I've noticed a lot of
[1:00:11] times folks screaming hot or very deep
[1:00:12] things they don't understand but the
[1:00:14] more they're in the sand the quieter
[1:00:15] they are try to say man when you get
[1:00:19] Walter on trample on kicks hit in the
[1:00:21] mouth slap OH
[1:00:26] notice what Jesus said even as the son
[1:00:29] of man are you learning of him are you
[1:00:32] learning of him heavy Valley as the son
[1:00:36] of man came not to be ministered unto
[1:00:37] but to minister to give his life a
[1:00:39] ransom a ransom not for everybody but
[1:00:46] for many I'm one of them Satan had me
[1:00:55] held up and he wanted ransom money and
[1:00:58] Jesus come paid my price so I could go
[1:01:02] free notice on Luke chapter 22 verse 27
[1:01:06] he says for others greater he that set a
[1:01:09] set meat or he that service now you'll
[1:01:15] imagine you go in this day of course

[1:01:18] that day they would have servants and
[1:01:20] slaves so you would be a guest to this

[1:02:02] when I'm ready or welcome to be received
[1:02:04] they will come out and receive me he'll
[1:02:06] go back and wait on the porch to do
[1:02:08] whatever Lord Jesus said don't you
[1:02:10] understand I did not come this one to be
[1:02:12] set at the table I come to answer the
[1:02:15] door I come to change your shoes oh I
[1:02:19] come to make you feel welcome are you
[1:02:24] here in church can we learn of him now
[1:02:27] keep in mind that position has changed
[1:02:29] now he's not that now he'll grow me the
[1:02:32] God but when he was here that's exactly
[1:02:35] the position he was in he answered the
[1:02:38] door of God's mercy and he said would
[1:02:40] you come in my father wants you to come
[1:02:42] in and sit he'll don't you come in or
[1:02:44] would you come in and sit down

[1:02:50] temperature too warm or can I get
[1:02:51] someone to fan for you notice this is
[1:03:03] your master whether it's greater he the
[1:03:07] citizen meter he'd that service so
[1:03:12] brother Jim sister Linda tell me but the
[1:03:14] donor sister Karen we're ready for
[1:03:15] separate ok
[1:03:16] so we go in and sit down she don't serve
[1:03:18] it but the Jim doesn't get me a glass of
[1:03:20] tea nothing else he sits down at the
[1:03:23] table the servants cup which is not
[1:03:27] potatoes sir
[1:03:28] they're trains to watch my hands to
[1:03:32] watch every move yes thank you I'll take
[1:03:37] a figure they move around the table what
[1:03:40] this is their position and Jesus said
[1:03:43] don't get in your mind that it's
[1:03:45] preachers everybody's to bow before you
[1:03:48] holy man of God preachers have made idol
[1:03:53] worship out of their positions
[1:03:56] purchase of servants the servants for
[1:04:01] deacons are servants the ministry is a
[1:04:04] position of sermons where many many
[1:04:06] servants in this church the the library
[1:04:08] the Deacons our trusty Sunday School
[1:04:10] teachers what is it it's the service
[1:04:12] they don't get paid for what they're
[1:04:13] doing they don't get paid that you very
[1:04:16] little even recognition for in the eyes
[1:04:18] but it is a position of servitude but
[1:04:22] keep the Lord Jesus in front of you it
[1:04:25] will help your yoke to be much easier
[1:04:27] for us we ought to be proud just to be
[1:04:31] servants in the house of God but for him
[1:04:33] who was the master and he put on the
[1:04:39] apron as he lost them servants would not
[1:04:44] be allowed to sit down at the same table
[1:04:46] where we had our supper they would have
[1:04:49] to wait until we were done and even at
[1:04:52] that they wouldn't get the same quality
[1:04:53] of food did we got so Jesus said I'm not
[1:04:57] him but sat down at the table with you
[1:04:59] you're at the table and I'm the one
[1:05:01] serving you what else you need Peter
[1:05:05] what else you want what can I bring for
[1:05:07] you is there anything you'd wants on
[1:05:08] what you're like another glass of water
[1:05:10] is there anything I can do anybody
[1:05:12] learning of him tonight I am among you
[1:05:16] as he that service so humbleness and
[1:05:21] meekness are yokes
[1:05:26] what humility and meekness my Oaks
[1:05:31] and most of us hate him
[1:05:39] why the contrary to our pride oh my
[1:05:44] and the aptness that we as humans have
[1:05:49] about blowing up who we are well Lord
[1:05:55] Jesus I I was convinced you want me to
[1:05:57] preach this tonight what I must have
[1:05:59] messed up somehow oh ma notice in Romans
[1:06:09] 5:19 Paul says as by one man's
[1:06:11] disobedience many were made sinners so
[1:06:20] by what you say you mean you were
[1:06:27] redeemed not only by blood but by
[1:06:31] obedience learn of me is there any of
[1:06:42] you men here in the church who would
[1:06:46] like to take the rap of being a
[1:06:47] homosexual any you want to take on you
[1:06:53] the being a male prostitute for other
[1:06:55] men what about some of your sisters do
[1:07:00] you not to take upon you the guilt of
[1:07:01] being a prostitute or a mother
[1:07:05] that had children that abandoned her
[1:07:06] children thief robber
[1:07:09] liar we wouldn't want to do that just in
[1:07:12] our saved condition then how would you
[1:07:14] like to be God and take that on you
[1:07:21] learn me
[1:07:23] you see freezers things we have to take
[1:07:26] and things we have to put up with for
[1:07:29] the end result to be pleasing to him
[1:07:32] oma notice pulse s for that one man's
[1:07:37] disobedience inners so by the obedience
[1:07:42] of one shall many again not all be made
[1:07:46] righteous
[1:07:48] Hebrews 5:8 though he were a son yet
[1:07:52] learned he obedience by the things which
[1:07:57] he suffered so here is the logos in a
[1:08:02] human body but the logos could not learn
[1:08:05] it just by recalling back as he was in
[1:08:09] the father's presence in the great
[1:08:12] divine omnipotence of God it's not like
[1:08:15] that knowledge could be transmitted down
[1:08:17] into the human body and all of a sudden
[1:08:19] Jesus would know it with the same
[1:08:22] clarity as if he would not die first
[1:08:25] this must be learned by obedience which
[1:08:28] comes by experience if Jesus could not
[1:08:31] know this by reading the word and this
[1:08:34] was his previous identity he was the
[1:08:37] volume of the book but yet he could not
[1:08:40] know it realistically even by being the
[1:08:43] word he had to become obedient to it so
[1:08:48] he actually simple said though he were a
[1:08:50] son yet learned he you are the logos in
[1:08:57] the human body learned something
[1:09:04] then I mean maybe I could be wrong but I
[1:09:08] still think there's a slight possibility
[1:09:09] some of us and the message can learn a
[1:09:11] few things I know for some it seemed I
[1:09:14] nearly a miracle boy you can't tell them
[1:09:16] nothing they know everything there is to
[1:09:18] know about everything are they a clock
[1:09:20] ticking but if Jesus learned I guarantee
[1:09:23] to this room for Donnie if Jesus learn
[1:09:26] there's room for every one of you said
[1:09:28] right here tonight 9:00
[1:09:34] notice again now Messi 11:28 come unto
[1:09:37] me all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[1:09:40] and I will give you rest take my yoke
[1:09:43] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[1:09:47] and lowly in heart and you shall find
[1:09:50] rest notice now the double use of the
[1:09:54] word rest when we come to him initially
[1:09:59] this is the grace of God the mercy of
[1:10:02] God that gives us peace what is that
[1:10:04] peace it's peace with God peace we've
[1:10:09] got so by justification accepting him as
[1:10:11] our Savior we have made peace we're gone
[1:10:14] we were alienated and of course now
[1:10:16] through the middle one petition been
[1:10:17] torn out and we've accepted Jesus Christ
[1:10:19] as our Savior and we had peace with God
[1:10:22] but that's not the peace of God now we
[1:10:26] make peace with God when we got saved
[1:10:28] the peace of God comes as we learn to
[1:10:32] submit and obey and are yoked up to
[1:10:35] Jesus Christ this is why some Christians
[1:10:38] are never happy they never reached that
[1:10:41] place of happiness that God wants them
[1:10:43] to have now search here they learn tyre
[1:10:45] they search here they look there and
[1:10:47] they think it's the church there in they
[1:10:49] think it's the preacher that they're
[1:10:50] under other thing if I could get a
[1:10:51] better job it's so sad when you see
[1:10:54] people that are Christian and they're
[1:10:56] never happy no matter where they are no
[1:10:58] matter where they go and it's always
[1:11:00] somebody else's fault don't you tell
[1:11:03] what it is they are lacking the peace of
[1:11:05] God in the
[1:11:07] old hard now watch these are the words
[1:11:13] of Jesus not mine come unto me all you
[1:11:17] who labor and are heavy laden and I will
[1:11:18] give you rest
[1:11:20] notice now the terms I will give you
[1:11:24] rest take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:11:26] me for I am meek and lowly in heart and
[1:11:28] ye shall find
[1:11:30] Oh
[1:11:35] so the first rest is given the second
[1:11:39] deeper rest is found you could come to
[1:11:47] church for 75 years and never find that
[1:11:49] second rest because you're expecting him
[1:11:52] to give it to you it is not given it is
[1:11:55] found but you can't find it unless you
[1:11:58] know there's another course of it if you
[1:12:01] think you've gone down you made peace
[1:12:02] with God and you don't realize there is
[1:12:04] peace of God then you live many many
[1:12:06] years of your life only in that first
[1:12:08] stage of peace and yet you've got a
[1:12:09] little peace shows you've got piece of
[1:12:10] garbage have no real deep settle picture
[1:12:12] than yourself you have no real fluid
[1:12:14] peace with the body and the members of
[1:12:15] the body of Christ but it's always a
[1:12:17] turmoil always something going on all
[1:12:19] the time unless you come into the second
[1:12:21] room and you actually find that peace oh
[1:12:25] praise the Lord then it won't be in the
[1:12:28] church it won't be a home in this matter
[1:12:30] I got a move over here to this man sir
[1:12:32] and then you get that whole nor though
[1:12:33] he's not the guy thought it would be all
[1:12:35] mine I'm going somewhere else and then
[1:12:36] they go over that you know I they're
[1:12:37] lacking peace within themselves notice
[1:12:42] this so the peace with God comes by
[1:12:45] surrender what he'll I feel sinful
[1:12:48] nature the peace of God comes as were
[1:12:52] yoked they strap around their neck the
[1:12:56] head on their shoulder look at this I
[1:13:00] love these words Jesus says in verse 30
[1:13:02] now my yoke is easy and the word easy
[1:13:07] means well fitted
[1:13:11] tailor-made for our lives and needs man
[1:13:16] alone well there's no easy Mendez Wow
[1:13:20] what a what a word to use my yoke is
[1:13:24] easy and other words the things that he
[1:13:26] allows me to go through our tailor made
[1:13:29] to fit my life my positive parts my
[1:13:32] negative parts and the ones in the
[1:13:34] middle he knows exactly how to make
[1:13:36] every one of our yokes
[1:13:38] that are produced exactly what he wants
[1:13:40] out of our lives and that's why we're
[1:13:42] envious sometime of other folks yo cuz
[1:13:45] we look at that like manly bill are
[1:13:46] easier to bear that than what I bear not
[1:13:49] if you're that man if you're that man he
[1:13:52] send the same thing about you or we're
[1:13:54] so he smiles all the time I mean ever
[1:13:57] has no battles that's what you think
[1:13:59] that's what she's saying but every
[1:14:01] person show is custom-made it is tailor
[1:14:04] made to fit around your neck according
[1:14:07] to how wide your shoulders are according
[1:14:09] to how strong your back is for my yoke
[1:14:28] tailor-made custom fit Wow my yoke is
[1:14:39] easy and my burden is light
[1:14:43] the riff that our soul finds in peace
[1:14:48] from within the source of the burst is
[1:14:51] what renders us to the place that we can
[1:14:54] say I can do this I can do this no
[1:15:00] matter what he demands of me I can do
[1:15:02] this now that ain't intellectual it's
[1:15:04] not mind over matter it's not just
[1:15:06] repeating repeating remember because
[1:15:08] remember the man down the engine-room if
[1:15:09] you don't believe it he'll still go
[1:15:10] round and around and around the harbour
[1:15:12] it's not intellectually memorizing the
[1:15:14] promises in the words and we've just
[1:15:16] been through all the affirmations and
[1:15:17] they're wonderful thank God for what is
[1:15:19] still ongoing but there must be a power
[1:15:21] released out of the word it cannot just
[1:15:24] be intellectual conception alone what's
[1:15:29] this now let's go back to first John if
[1:15:31] you would chapter five verse three for
[1:15:34] this is the love of God that we keep his
[1:15:37] Commandments and His commandments are
[1:15:41] not Grievous for whatsoever is born of
[1:15:45] God overcometh the world and this is the
[1:15:47] victory that overcometh the world even
[1:15:48] our faith no New Testament writer makes
[1:15:54] such frequent use of the metaphors of
[1:15:58] combat and victory and overcoming as
[1:16:03] does the disciple of love John
[1:16:09] now what'd you think of that there is no
[1:16:11] doubt that John had learned this phrase
[1:16:15] from the Lord Jesus now watch look what
[1:16:19] he said whatsoever is born of God
[1:16:20] overcometh the world this is the victory
[1:16:22] that overcometh the world even our face
[1:16:24] now God had given him the insight that
[1:16:26] the Christian walk is going to be such
[1:16:28] an embattlement Paul dealt with it we
[1:16:30] know as a soldier and all that but John
[1:16:32] over and over from the Epistle of John
[1:16:34] are on through the book of Revelation
[1:16:36] over and over again it's like God had so
[1:16:39] gripped the man that had such a
[1:16:40] perception of love had such a perception
[1:16:43] of war such a perception of overcoming
[1:16:46] and the constant struggle that would be
[1:16:48] undoing in the life of a child of God I
[1:16:51] don't think that's a mistake myself I
[1:16:53] think it's a great parallel hallelujah
[1:16:56] now notice this baby'll it's front such
[1:16:59] an imprint upon John's mind and his
[1:17:02] being as they were sitting there that
[1:17:05] night one hour before the Garden of
[1:17:08] Gethsemane a figure this long years of
[1:17:16] persistence and trials this book is
[1:17:19] written around 1993 ad something like
[1:17:21] that when John writes epistle so John
[1:17:24] had seen here a semadar and first John
[1:17:27] 2:13 not running do you father's because
[1:17:28] you've known him that is from the
[1:17:30] beginning I write unto you young men
[1:17:32] because you have overcome the wicked one
[1:17:35] I write unto you little children because
[1:17:38] you have known the father I have written
[1:17:41] unto you father's because you have known
[1:17:43] him that is from the beginning I have
[1:17:45] written unto you young men because you
[1:17:47] are strong and the Word of God abideth
[1:17:50] in you and you have overcome the wicked
[1:17:53] one for Sean four for y'all God's little
[1:17:57] children and have overcome them because
[1:17:59] greater is He that is in you than he
[1:18:02] that is in the world revelation 2:7 he
[1:18:05] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:18:06] spirit saith unto the churches
[1:18:08] to him that overcometh will I give to
[1:18:10] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[1:18:12] midst of the paradise of God listen the
[1:18:14] seven consecutive ages he that has
[1:18:16] adhered let him hear what the Spirit
[1:18:19] says to the churches he that overcomes
[1:18:21] shall not be hurt of the second death
[1:18:23] now the very epistle of love the very
[1:18:25] apostle of love the very man who had
[1:18:27] such a perception of love yet he's
[1:18:29] inspired to write overcome overcome
[1:18:31] overcome battle warfare why it goes hand
[1:18:35] in hand he that overcometh and keepeth
[1:18:38] my works unto the him to him will I give
[1:18:40] power over the nation's revelation 3:5
[1:18:43] he that overcometh the same shall be
[1:18:45] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[1:18:47] blot out his name out of the book of
[1:18:49] life but I will confess his name before
[1:18:51] my father and before his angels
[1:18:52] revelation 3:12 him that overcometh
[1:18:55] alone make a pillar in the temple of my
[1:18:57] god notice it over and over again not he
[1:19:00] that believes the message not he the
[1:19:02] goes to church not her that has long
[1:19:04] heard him that don't don't look like a
[1:19:06] woman but him that overcometh this is
[1:19:12] the victory that overcometh the world
[1:19:13] even our face how are we ever going to
[1:19:16] overcome if we cannot be truly yoked to
[1:19:20] Christ in submission again revelation
[1:19:24] 3:21 to him that overcometh I grant to
[1:19:26] seven men i throne even as I also
[1:19:28] overcame and sat down with my father in
[1:19:30] his psalm revelation 21:7 he that
[1:19:32] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[1:19:34] I will be his God and he shall be my son
[1:19:38] where did John get this imprint since
[1:19:43] he's the only apostle that worded it
[1:19:45] this way what was it that he heard that
[1:19:50] made it so special
[1:19:53] it comes as the night has now progressed
[1:20:00] they can see his fear they know there's
[1:20:05] something going on it's just got this
[1:20:08] aura about him he looks different he's
[1:20:12] acting different
[1:20:12] they've noticed it leading up to it for
[1:20:15] a while but now it seems more intent
[1:20:19] especially the last week since they've
[1:20:21] been in Jerusalem and they can see him
[1:20:26] as his setting at the table and it seems
[1:20:29] he's so nervous
[1:20:30] that human part about him no doubt
[1:20:34] reflected humanity and submission they
[1:20:40] can tell that something is peculiar this
[1:20:45] the feeling in the air the way he's
[1:20:48] looking and the words is sad they can
[1:20:52] tell by what he's leading up to
[1:20:53] something terrible it's fixing to happen
[1:20:56] I'm gonna suffer the hands of the
[1:20:58] sitter's the hour of the power of
[1:21:01] darkness has now come all these
[1:21:04] statements that he's saying and now he
[1:21:06] leads right up to this and he tells him
[1:21:08] this is my body paint gate he handles
[1:21:13] them to cut this is my blood in the New
[1:21:15] Testament which is shed for you they're
[1:21:19] sinking in our mind what is going on oh
[1:21:20] no I thought he was the one that was to
[1:21:24] come to save us or what in the world is
[1:21:26] happening what oh no what what is going
[1:21:29] wrong and then all of a sudden he moves
[1:21:32] from this bleak time and he says be of
[1:21:37] good cheer I have overcome the world
[1:21:53] how is that possible he's not died glory
[1:22:03] damn good chill I have not I will I have
[1:22:09] overcome the world now let me ask you we
[1:22:16] talk about it a lot here in our church
[1:22:17] if any of you have heard it for many
[1:22:18] many years John let me remind you again
[1:22:22] as John says in first John 5 for
[1:22:24] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[1:22:25] world and this is a victory that
[1:22:27] overcometh the world even our faith so
[1:22:31] what is the world what is the world if I
[1:22:37] would give each of you a piece of paper
[1:22:38] - not another Tay - write down ten
[1:22:40] things that you would identify swirlie
[1:22:45] ten things what would you write down Bob
[1:22:49] hair lipstick make it short dresses
[1:22:54] pants on women I didn't think y'all
[1:23:00] could get no Quadra than us a while ago
[1:23:02] but I believe you are going to movies
[1:23:12] going to the beach why would you write
[1:23:14] down its of the world in worldly all the
[1:23:18] above that I mentioned none of them were
[1:23:21] in heaven when Satan fell none of them
[1:23:25] were in the Garden of Eden none of them
[1:23:29] have been in existence except for the
[1:23:30] last hundred years which means if that's
[1:23:33] your view of worldly and of the world
[1:23:34] that means there was no sin up to a
[1:23:37] hundred years ago
[1:23:44] [Applause]
[1:23:48] so what is the world what is the world
[1:23:52] what is the world that were to overcome
[1:23:56] not truly there are worldly attributes
[1:23:59] that are identified by certain thing but
[1:24:02] is that the world did Jesus overcome
[1:24:06] bobbed hair there was no cigarettes why
[1:24:11] there was no Morgans there was no
[1:24:12] pornography penal never had to drive
[1:24:18] down the road and see all kinds of signs
[1:24:19] up with have- women so what did Peter
[1:24:23] have to deal with praise the Lord there
[1:24:27] was no internet so what did they have to
[1:24:28] deal with the world the world now Jesus
[1:24:37] actually spoke more about the world than
[1:24:41] any other New Testament speaker you
[1:24:44] ought to be very careful when you look
[1:24:46] at the word world because it is a very
[1:24:48] very broad word it is from the Greek
[1:24:50] word of course which you know is cosmos
[1:24:52] but it has multiple meanings and the
[1:24:57] applications of those meanings can be
[1:24:59] very very tricky what since in Matthew
[1:25:03] 13 22 jesus said he also that received
[1:25:05] the seed among the thorns is he that
[1:25:07] heareth the word and the care of this
[1:25:11] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[1:25:14] choke the word now remember no
[1:25:17] cigarettes no drinking no movie houses
[1:25:20] nothing not drinking we know today no
[1:25:23] marijuana no cocaine no none of that
[1:25:25] stuff so wide in the world would be able
[1:25:27] to choke a man backside 2,000 years ago
[1:25:30] the world so the cares of the world
[1:25:35] weren't existence when Jesus faked this
[1:25:38] parallel do you believe that the elect
[1:25:41] of God would have been able in that day
[1:25:43] to have identified the world just like
[1:25:46] you and I can identify the world today
[1:25:48] Peter and James and John if they could
[1:25:50] rush erect in the morning and
[1:25:52] welcome this earth that probably pass
[1:25:54] out by noon they probably couldn't take
[1:25:56] the pressure of all the seven doesn't
[1:25:58] say how in the world do you all live in
[1:26:00] this terrible day I thought it was awful
[1:26:03] when I was here my goodness it is I
[1:26:05] belong there compared to what y'all deal
[1:26:07] with but yet they had the world to deal
[1:26:12] with and the elements and the rudiments
[1:26:14] of the world now notice Jesus gives in
[1:26:16] this parable of the seed how that the
[1:26:18] cares of this world and the
[1:26:21] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[1:26:22] so to choke the word and I notice how
[1:26:25] they could do this how could a thorn
[1:26:27] choke the word this is the marvel the
[1:26:30] thorn was raised up or come right out of
[1:26:33] the same ground and it was so close to
[1:26:37] the seed that it could actually
[1:26:40] overpower that seed now what if the seed
[1:26:44] was right here and the thorns was in the
[1:26:47] office or the thorns was out on the
[1:26:51] parking lot there would be no threat
[1:26:53] there would be no difficulty and let
[1:26:55] it'll be a nettle or something like that
[1:26:57] that would spread but for some of these
[1:26:59] thorns that Jesus used the Darnell and
[1:27:01] some of the words that he used it was
[1:27:03] not so much a spreading type of a thorn
[1:27:06] but it was a thorn what's most planted
[1:27:08] in the same ground so you mean to tell
[1:27:10] me that a person hears the Word of God
[1:27:12] and they receive the Word of God and in
[1:27:15] that same ground is the sticky nature
[1:27:24] huckleberry oh here we go again so the
[1:27:29] thorny is not something way over yonder
[1:27:32] in another church somewhere or your
[1:27:34] great-great-great uncle that you don't
[1:27:35] even see but 13 times in your life if my
[1:27:38] uncle died and though I get rid of a lot
[1:27:40] of our problems your problem ain't your
[1:27:42] uncle it's your old fully hide it's just
[1:27:46] so thorny ground and it's amazing
[1:27:49] because look at this not Jesus the way
[1:27:51] this place is he said he the received
[1:27:53] seed among the thorns is he that heareth
[1:27:55] the word and the care of this world and
[1:27:57] his Cephas of riches choke the word so
[1:28:00] the world and the thorn is so close that
[1:28:04] the thorn can reach over and choke the
[1:28:08] word that's too close for comfort that
[1:28:23] means an ain't the guy that lives down
[1:28:24] the road from me or the guy that lives
[1:28:27] in the next neighborhood from me or the
[1:28:28] cul-de-sac above me it means it's the
[1:28:31] same guy that I'll lay down with it
[1:28:32] nicer it's the guy brush his teeth in
[1:28:35] the morning I comb this hair for I come
[1:28:37] to church why because this is grounds
[1:28:40] and even though the soul is good ground
[1:28:42] this is the embodiment it can be the
[1:28:45] embodiment of thorns it can be the
[1:28:47] carrier of the good seed but the thorns
[1:28:49] live so close notice then look how close
[1:28:52] it is in your soul receives the word in
[1:28:56] your spirit and in your flesh can be the
[1:28:59] thorny sticky nature
[1:29:08] and yet Jesus didn't say nothing about
[1:29:11] television here he's talking about the
[1:29:16] cares of this world not the sinful
[1:29:25] things but the cares you just get so
[1:29:28] busy
[1:29:28] well praise the Lord the cares of this
[1:29:34] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[1:29:37] choke the word but wait a minute I
[1:29:39] thought the word was so powerful I
[1:29:41] thought the word could create and do it
[1:29:44] can but when the word comes out of the
[1:29:46] heavens into the human heart and put in
[1:29:49] a little parcel of ground in your human
[1:29:52] plot the word requires conditions
[1:29:56] sunlight moisture and requires all these
[1:30:00] things in order to grow and if not them
[1:30:03] all thorns which already have everything
[1:30:05] they need they have the sarnax which is
[1:30:09] your fleshly nature they don't need Holy
[1:30:12] Ghost rain
[1:30:12] they don't need Holy Ghost preaching I
[1:30:14] think they don't like it they had to
[1:30:17] haul the nutrients they need in your
[1:30:19] human flesh my and it's Rives and
[1:30:23] clothes and bought that phone and get
[1:30:25] bigger and bigger and longer and longer
[1:30:27] and Gouger and gouge ear if there is
[1:30:30] such a word and it'll stick and prod and
[1:30:32] stick and probe around and get that
[1:30:34] little word of center
[1:30:35] [Laughter]
[1:30:40] I don't need just go to church tonight I
[1:30:44] need some good Holy Ghost rain to fall
[1:30:45] in that I need some good vitamins of the
[1:30:48] word I need some good nutrients and that
[1:30:50] thorn said not me I'm doing great
[1:30:53] no matter of fact I don't need to go to
[1:30:55] church I need a Dollywood weekend
[1:31:03] mother chairman spud the Donna gonna be
[1:31:05] gone
[1:31:06] it's another Dollywood we can bail the
[1:31:10] darkness out of town come on take the
[1:31:14] children let us all go down we did all
[1:31:19] the one ride up and down the girl it's
[1:31:22] another Dollywood we can pack up the
[1:31:25] suitcases and let's go people from
[1:31:34] Africa probably sinking
[1:31:46] by over spreading all the powers and
[1:31:50] faculties the attributes in the word the
[1:31:55] thorn over tops the seed and actually
[1:32:00] jokes a little at a time not to alarm it
[1:32:09] first just starts to putting his hands
[1:32:11] on snare oh that hurts
[1:32:22] really well you think that hurts you're
[1:32:29] just getting ready to feel hurt I'm
[1:32:33] gonna choke Malachi four out of your
[1:32:36] life
[1:32:38] revelation teen Luke seventeen thirty
[1:32:40] the coming of the Lord hold on us all
[1:32:42] these things I don't wanna choke it
[1:32:45] right out of your life we'll take one
[1:32:48] thing if it hadn't been for God's grace
[1:32:50] many of us had had this word choked out
[1:32:51] of our lives
[1:32:53] but God's got some preachers that know
[1:32:56] how to chopped out thorns thank God for
[1:33:04] the Holy Ghost God call me that come
[1:33:07] down your little garden patch and they
[1:33:08] got a hole on one side and a mattock on
[1:33:11] another they got a shovel on this pocket
[1:33:13] they got weed killer in that pocket
[1:33:14] whatever they you need they've got it
[1:33:17] because God prepared them for you he
[1:33:20] knew you would live in this sea choke
[1:33:22] today and he called me of this hour and
[1:33:25] equip them with the Spirit of God and
[1:33:27] the Word of God and the wisdom of God to
[1:33:30] chop the leads right out of your life
[1:33:33] hallelujah so you can be a fruitful
[1:33:36] person I don't want to just be a
[1:33:40] Christian I want to be a fruitful
[1:33:42] Christian he's ever received the seed
[1:33:54] among the thorns is he that hears the
[1:33:55] word in the care of this world and the
[1:33:58] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[1:34:00] and he becometh not an infidel not an
[1:34:06] agnostic but it just becomes unfruitful
[1:34:11] and being unfruitful to a Christian is
[1:34:14] very very sad it's very very empty well
[1:34:18] the most empty feelings that a vine can
[1:34:20] have is barrenness
[1:34:26] Banas let me go just one step father can
[1:34:31] now watch this Luke 12:27 consider the
[1:34:34] lilies how they grow they tore not they
[1:34:39] spin not yet I say unto you the solemn
[1:34:41] and all of his glory was not arrayed
[1:34:43] like one of these if God so clothes the
[1:34:46] grass was just today in the field and
[1:34:49] tomorrow's cast into the oven how much
[1:34:52] more will he clothe you O ye of little
[1:34:55] faith and seek not what you shall eat
[1:34:59] now listen or what you shall drink
[1:35:03] neither be of a doubtful mind now notice
[1:35:10] this is an anxious distressing mindset
[1:35:15] now listen carefully
[1:35:16] this is worldly when you are worrying
[1:35:25] and fretting and allowing your faith to
[1:35:28] be paralysed you are under a worldly
[1:35:31] spirit that went over about like I
[1:35:38] figured it was it hits in the morning
[1:35:42] about 3:30 now think they said not my
[1:35:47] once again listen what Jesus said he
[1:35:49] shows us how that the lilies don't toll
[1:35:52] and that don't spin then he shows us in
[1:35:53] verse 28 if God caused the grass which
[1:35:57] is today in the field and tomorrow's
[1:35:58] cast into the oven how worthless it
[1:36:00] would seemingly be then he says how much
[1:36:02] more would it cause you oh you are the
[1:36:04] little face and seek not you that what
[1:36:06] she shall eat or what ye shall drink
[1:36:08] neither shall be of doubtful my notice a
[1:36:10] doubtful mine so when a person enters
[1:36:13] into the faith oh I don't know how we're
[1:36:14] gonna make it oh what are we going to
[1:36:15] eat what a girl all I don't know how to
[1:36:17] know God wants us to be concerned
[1:36:19] friends but if we're not careful we
[1:36:22] cross over the line of being concerned
[1:36:24] to being of a doubtful mind and a
[1:36:28] doubtful mind
[1:36:30] is worldly it is unstable the word here
[1:36:43] is unstable in constant wandering in
[1:36:47] your thoughts about things notice now in
[1:36:50] verse 30 Jesus said for all these things
[1:36:55] do the nations of the cosmos see gift so
[1:37:10] you mean a woman can dress godly on the
[1:37:12] outside a man could dress godly yet in
[1:37:15] their thoughts constant worrying about
[1:37:16] this old home oh just one thing and it
[1:37:20] never against it just changes from A to
[1:37:22] B and from B to C once C get settled D
[1:37:25] is that once they get settle is that do
[1:37:28] you understand that is of the world the
[1:37:31] worldly nations cosmos that's the way
[1:37:36] they look at it
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:46] notice Jesus your father knows that you
[1:37:53] have need of these things but what
[1:38:00] becomes doubtful should we be concerned
[1:38:03] absolutely so we could be concerned
[1:38:06] about our time and the economy
[1:38:07] absolutely we should but man we've done
[1:38:10] everything we know to do what more can
[1:38:12] you do I'll tell you what most of us did
[1:38:16] when we've done everything we know to do
[1:38:18] we don't stand there for we worry
[1:38:20] therefore and then we become into a
[1:38:25] doubtful mind Jesus said don't you know
[1:38:28] your father knows you need these things
[1:38:30] so whenever we enter into a doubtful
[1:38:33] mind we are becoming worldly why because
[1:38:39] it's contrary to Scripture this is even
[1:38:42] more plain than a woman wearing makeup
[1:38:44] this is even more plain than some of the
[1:38:47] things that we identify this is more
[1:38:49] plain than television
[1:38:50] there's no scriptures that says the word
[1:38:52] television there's no scripture that
[1:38:54] says many of the things that we as
[1:38:56] message people identify as the world yet
[1:38:57] this is absolute scripture that we
[1:39:00] become of a doubtful man and it is
[1:39:02] worldly to do so Jesus system should
[1:39:15] know your father knows if you go to a
[1:39:21] doctor tomorrow or the next day and you
[1:39:22] find out something is in your body or
[1:39:24] condition that you didn't know you think
[1:39:26] God fell apart when the doctor told you
[1:39:28] that he already knew it he knew it
[1:39:32] before the foundation of the world
[1:39:37] butthole God Oh God Christian hat is
[1:39:41] people it's got computers and internet

[1:39:47] across your right wrist it turns at a
[1:39:49] right angle and your big toe jumps big
[1:39:54] toe jumps streak across right wrist

[1:40:12] there's no killer will you poor little
[1:40:14] monkey Perkis you I'll tell your friends
[1:40:21] this on the worst things we can do
[1:40:22] sometimes when we go to identify in our
[1:40:24] line symptoms with Lion Devils the
[1:40:28] Internet can be a very helpful thing
[1:40:30] until you go to line up with unbelief
[1:40:31] and if you're not careful you'll bring
[1:40:34] your body in an exact identification of
[1:40:37] a lying symptom that you found on a
[1:40:39] website come on now don't get quiet on
[1:40:42] me all the other dummy times are hard I
[1:40:44] know they're hard that my God is still
[1:40:47] God and off as far as I know that
[1:40:49] scripture said the book of Philippians
[1:40:51] my God will supply all of your need
[1:40:54] according to his riches and glory I'll
[1:40:57] tell one thing if it gets so hard when
[1:40:59] God food my god still got Ravens
[1:41:01] I've seen some around my house today God
[1:41:04] can have them to fry me up a hamburger
[1:41:06] he can have them fix me ham meat in the
[1:41:08] morning he can have them give me a steak
[1:41:10] at suppertime at night if that's what he
[1:41:12] wants me to do but all I gotta do is
[1:41:14] live for him and trust him and get a
[1:41:17] worldly doubtful mind away from me
[1:41:21] hallelujah while because worry has no
[1:41:24] virtue
[1:41:26] [Applause]
[1:41:31] go ahead and give him a hand again
[1:41:34] [Applause]
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:48] so the nations of the cosmos this is
[1:41:53] their man set this is what they seek
[1:41:56] after look Jesus goes on in verse 31 but
[1:42:02] rather seek ye the kingdom of God and
[1:42:09] all these things shall be added don't
[1:42:14] you see we're doing it backwards we're
[1:42:17] doing exactly backwards this is why
[1:42:19] friends many Christians are not blessed
[1:42:21] brothers we'll start a business and they
[1:42:23] wonder why they're not blessed they put
[1:42:26] their business before God how can God
[1:42:29] bless a business that is placed in
[1:42:32] opposition to his word don't put the
[1:42:36] business first don't put money first but
[1:42:37] seek him first then these other things
[1:42:40] will be added you're not to seek daily
[1:42:44] food praise the Lord
[1:42:49] you're not to seek your insurance and
[1:42:51] Obamacare and this and that one Oh Lord
[1:42:53] okay what are we going to heaven oh well
[1:42:57] that's going to come upon us on the
[1:42:58] other body but it depends on what your
[1:43:01] mentality become now you keep here stuck
[1:43:03] in Fox News and some over here stuck
[1:43:05] over there oh god oh god oh god it's
[1:43:06] terrible terrible stuff example what the
[1:43:08] change is terrible
[1:43:09] oh my brother I got good news to tell
[1:43:12] you the bride shot on the very break I'm
[1:43:14] going into body change all these Saints
[1:43:16] have got to come to pass yes sir but
[1:43:18] it's leading me in you know a change
[1:43:21] notice the very opposite which is the
[1:43:24] opposite Jesus says but rather seek ye
[1:43:30] the kingdom of God and all these things
[1:43:35] food raiment shelter shall be added to
[1:43:44] you don't seek them seek God and these
[1:43:48] things were just added blessings fear
[1:43:56] not little flock for it is your father's
[1:44:01] good pleasure to give you the kingdom it
[1:44:12] is worldly to be a for doubtful that it
[1:44:17] is worldly when we let go of face and
[1:44:19] worry I know each of you have to find
[1:44:23] that fine line of concern and worry
[1:44:25] there is no way you'll tell me about
[1:44:27] Scripture nor by the message that you
[1:44:29] can worry and have faith at the same
[1:44:31] time you've got to have one or the other
[1:44:37] you cannot have this faith is heavenly
[1:44:41] worry is worldly well I might need to
[1:44:46] preach this again in the morning
[1:44:55] listen to the scripture st. John 16:33
[1:44:59] these things have spoken unto you that
[1:45:03] in me you might have peace in the world
[1:45:08] you shall have tribulation but be of
[1:45:13] good cheer I have overcome the world
[1:45:20] one hour before guests M&E looks like
[1:45:27] the very end of everything they've hoped
[1:45:29] for he says I have overcome already
[1:45:34] finished they didn't say the grave right
[1:45:38] he said the world so the order of the
[1:45:40] world cosmos it's Prince its power every
[1:45:44] bit of it had already been put under his
[1:45:46] feet this is a kind of Christian I will
[1:45:49] be before I leave this world that I can
[1:45:53] look around at layer to see and say I
[1:45:55] have overcome Leo to seal I don't want
[1:45:59] to put on my tombstone well he lived a
[1:46:01] good life and after we burned him to
[1:46:03] finally overcome they'll put that lie on
[1:46:04] my tombstone
[1:46:05] I want to overcome now before I leave I
[1:46:09] want to overcome the order the loss the
[1:46:11] line everything that's there I have
[1:46:13] overcome literacy learn of me let's pray
[1:46:22] together Lord Jesus I'll pray these
[1:46:26] simple words would go so deep into our
[1:46:30] hearts that will transform our lives
[1:46:34] Lord I'm so sorry if I've emphasized
[1:46:39] anything or through the years other than
[1:46:43] important things of variant that would
[1:46:47] lead your people to a deeper walk I'm
[1:46:51] sorry Lord if I've ever cause anyone to
[1:46:54] stumble or let anyone astray in any way
[1:46:57] away from Christ lord I ask you tonight
[1:47:03] that she would help me and help these
[1:47:05] people to be willing to take our
[1:47:08] tailored yoke through our submissive
[1:47:11] will and allow you to yoke us up may
[1:47:18] reap all the plow as it were may we be
[1:47:21] as a mother or father or a business man
[1:47:23] what have we our Lord the world is
[1:47:27] starving to death for life
[1:47:29] help us to be examples over daughter
[1:47:32] teach us Lord Jesus I'm willing to learn
[1:47:36] father you've taught me many years ago
[1:47:40] how to cast out Devils
[1:47:42] you taught me before I ever come to the
[1:47:44] message to believe that you could do the
[1:47:47] supernatural
[1:47:47] I saw many things before I become to the
[1:47:51] message in a supernatural realm I'm
[1:47:53] grateful for that the lure don't want to
[1:47:56] learn of you I don't want to just learn
[1:47:59] a message theology I want to learn of
[1:48:02] you help me not to retaliate Lord help
[1:48:08] me to learn there's power and Submission
[1:48:11] and love can happen God how many once
[1:48:18] said as well
[1:48:20] how many wants to love like Jesus loved
[1:48:26] ever sister there's gonna be bad tests
[1:48:28] and I shall come let me taste something
[1:48:31] the other day I stopped down
[1:48:33] Elizabethton to see a businessman and
[1:48:35] acquaintance he's had some real terrible
[1:48:38] things to happen to him physically I
[1:48:40] hadn't seen him for a long time I can't
[1:48:43] hardly walk just see him some real
[1:48:46] terrible terrible things my heart was so
[1:48:49] moved toward this man I just kept
[1:48:52] telling him I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
[1:48:56] and when I got ready to leave his place
[1:49:00] of business I just so felt in my heart
[1:49:04] to embrace him so I went over to him and
[1:49:08] I said I'm so sorry I'm gonna be praying
[1:49:12] for you it was like the love of God fell
[1:49:16] down in that little place or who was he
[1:49:20] started bawling and crying like a baby
[1:49:23] shaking like a leaf whenever I walked
[1:49:27] out of his place of business
[1:49:28] he had customers out in front waiting
[1:49:30] the scene and I walked out he was still
[1:49:33] standing there shaking and trembling
[1:49:36] couldn't even speak and I thought wonder
[1:49:41] if I would have give him a doctrine
[1:49:42] if that would have done that to him
[1:49:45] because I know what he believes he
[1:49:47] certainly don't believe what we believe
[1:49:49] what if I would have give him an opinion
[1:49:51] about something maybe if I would have
[1:49:54] rebuked him over this or that Heather
[1:49:57] but it sucks something moved on my being
[1:50:02] now I will say something it felt as if
[1:50:06] though the Lord Jesus himself was taking
[1:50:12] my arms and going around him as I pulled
[1:50:18] him up into my arms and I just began to
[1:50:20] panic I said I love you Betty I thought
[1:50:25] I left that place I come home told Carol
[1:50:27] about it every day this week it's just
[1:50:30] so affected me and I felt truly truly
[1:50:34] we're living in a world that is starving
[1:50:37] to death
[1:50:38] for love I'm not telling I love the
[1:50:46] compromises for saying I didn't change
[1:50:48] one thing what I believe but I believe
[1:50:51] he was able to sense a person greater
[1:50:54] than me is there anybody here that would
[1:50:58] be willing to give Jesus your arms Jesus
[1:51:03] your mouth so you'd be able to embrace
[1:51:04] somebody that was a Baptist or Methodist
[1:51:06] or a Church of Christ or a parousia or a
[1:51:09] to soul or a term ministry or whatever
[1:51:11] they'd believe be and we'd lay aside the
[1:51:14] label and had Jesus that Jesus I'll tell
[1:51:20] you to me or some one of the greatest
[1:51:23] things I've seen God heal the sick
[1:51:25] through my hands I've seen God cast out
[1:51:27] devils I saying God do so many things
[1:51:29] I'll give us one the greatest miracles
[1:51:32] I've ever experienced because I felt
[1:51:36] another person Cal can tell you when I
[1:51:40] come home ascending our bathroom tell
[1:51:41] her about it
[1:51:42] I couldn't have our keep from crying
[1:51:44] because I felt another person
[1:51:47] / children this is what I'm talking
[1:51:49] about that person is this what is there
[1:51:57] anybody here besides me that wants to
[1:52:01] let Jesus left me that way
[1:52:04] praise God
[1:52:09] jesus loves me this I know for the Bible
[1:52:19] tells me so little ones to him belong
[1:52:34] they are weak but he's strong yes jesus
[1:52:46] loves me
[1:52:52] yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me

[1:54:33] wrestling in and our pride gets in our
[1:54:35] way and the questions getting in the way
