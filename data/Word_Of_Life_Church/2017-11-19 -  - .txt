with him amen amen praise the Lord we are happy to be here tonight we certainly appreciate your pastor in his absence amen wonderful man of God we appreciate all of you to come out we bring greetings from back home in South Carolina from pastor and church family amen most of all Jesus is here how many brother liquefier with them now I don't believe in going to church without a fire hallelujah I believe in having a burning hallelujah I don't believe in just coming and sitting on the Pew but I believe in a burning we need to have a burn in the night man we need to let the fire loose in the place tonight hallelujah that's why we call me man to see Jesus amen and I believe that if we come in our attitudes of right God can't help but show up hallelujah so if you do your part he'll automatically do his part you're a prophet of God says that the signs and wonders automatically follow the believer you don't have to do that special they automatically follow you now I don't know about you but I got some I got some miracles behind me hallelujah I got some blessings behind me they just following me waiting for me to realize oh yeah what God is gonna do in my life let me let me read a scripture or something amen we started appreciating the worst of all man stop right there let's get into the word it man let's have a word of Prayer and then we'll get into the word tonight if you have an unspoken question you can acknowledge it by uplifted hand they may let's just pray Lord Jesus father we love you and we thank you for the grace that you've given Lord knowing that we've done nothing to deserve it but it's all your choosing Lord and follow we didn't seek after you but you salt us because you knew who we were before the foundation of the world and Lord as you see each and every hand lifted most of all you see the hearts that I open unto you tonight father we pray that you fill our cups again fill us afresh Lord with your presence your power Lord God and and let the word find good ground tonight Lord that it will bring forth one hundredfold nor God and let the fruit in our lives Lord speak for itself and Lord I would just ask father you walk the house in this church like you've done so many times Lord and then all flesh get out of the way Lord for this service is about you and you alone and Lord many of us were here with vessels and we've been in church a long time but the service is all about you our lives are all about you but whatever we can contribute to the kingdom of God it's all about you so father we thank you Father for a chance to be used by you and Lord we just pray you have your way in us in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ forgive us our sins and trespasses in the name of Jesus Christ we pray that church say Amen Amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Romans the ninth chapter thank you brother Louie don't waste no time dude he must he must know what's about to happen hallelujah everybody can't fight with a jacket on Romans nine good the signal buddy brother Joel back there how they love you romans nine and um let's just read um they started verse nine Romans nine and nine and then we're gonna go to first Peter one Romans nine and nine the Bible says for this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one when even by our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither have done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated a man first Peter one first Peter one familiar verses of Scripture to make a short let's stop reading at verse sinks first Peter one and six the Bible says wherein you greatly rejoice who not though now for a season if need be ye are in heaven is through metaphor temptation that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ they made me the Lord of the Blessed reading of his word you can have your seats and as you sit I want to turn over to Psalms 37 I want to read these verses of scriptures because I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get back to him again Psalms 37 at verse 39 the Bible says but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble Amen praise the Lord you know we have so many precious promises that God has given us and I and I want you to understand that every promise that God has given is already ours amen then all we have to do is take God at His Word he meant you know because God will back up whatever he said and tonight I want to say it like this then I have something very tasty tonight hallelujah I have something very good for the believer tonight amen because when God starts dealing with me about it I just start smiling hallelujah you know ideas when God reveals something to you it just makes you feel good hallelujah sometimes you you can't explain it you just riding down in the car and you begin to think about what God is it's expressing to you and it's work and you just start smiling and the person in the next car they may be all mad going to work and they look over at you and they see somebody doing this because you're thinking about what God has revealed to you hallelujah and let me say it like this whatever God has revealed to you if his in his word it's a promise who a car accident can take it away a hurricane came take it away a blizzard came taking away my ice storm can't take it away if God promised it and he revealed it to you he's yours oh yeah and that's what we need to do is take God at His Word and you know tonight my subject is a man subject inspiration what if you want to call it take it out of you main but my sucker tonight is trouble huh Leah brings purpose amen and you know that we are people that don't like trouble we don't like to be tried we don't like to be tested but let me tell you something that's God's Way God loves to put us to a test God loves to bring trouble that way because the troubles in your life makes God come on the scene hallelujah and without no trouble God wouldn't be able to express himself hallelujah come on church I tell you I got something tasty for you tonight because if you going through something there's a purpose behind so we need to acknowledge this one thing everything every trouble that we go through every child we go through every situation every tribulation is always not the devil booyah we don't snatch it back from him tonight now I think some of you notice hallelujah I may have said this before but you know I had cancer in my brain whoo yeah and a very tender age and cancer in my brain but you know what the devil gets no credit because there was a purpose for that trouble coming in my life for the brand hallelujah amen it was a total devil to see how strong he was what cancer could do now there was one thing one purpose only hallelujah because when cancer came cancer was the only thing that could awaken the purpose of God [Applause] God's had to see glory God had to sin some trouble in my life why because there was a hidden purpose T oh yeah so I was all I wanted to be a football player hallelujah all I wanted to be a the next Herschel Walker whatever you want to call it holy you know a lot of us had dreams and we had aspirations and different things we wanted to do and God began to see his trouble in your life you know why because you were on the wrong path so God had to shake up your path he had to shake up your journey he had to send some trouble why because he had a purpose and I want you to understand hallelujah that there's something down and you that nobody else can see but God and it may look like this person is that person may have seen but no maybe God is doing something job look like hallelujah he had done something wrong to his friends but no God was up to something God sent that trouble hellooo and what I love about hallelujah God told the devil where to go no keep this up I might have a praise dance up in here [Applause] hallelujah but she knows attended it in church denomination way of thinking we think that when we go through something or people think that when you go through something this it's like oh why me he and hey why am I going through this and you know what I opposed to be your son because you are his son his daughter he sees the trouble because there's something called a promise call for me you something called adoption and you never get there unless you're proven you'll never get there unless you're tested you'll never get there unless God who you shows the enemy that you are a son you are a dog hallelujah so you know me in the hospital going through all that I'm going through and and I'm thinking you know at that time I wanted to play football and what's going on but God knew that there was something down inside that had to be awakened and cancer was the only thing that could trouble it wow that's some things in Darwin in his church tonight and God has sick some trouble to awaken was there ho and you know by that falling upon me and isn't it put my family under the stress and put my momma under the stress but there was something that was about to happen I see I want you to understand this church that when trouble comes if you are a saint of God with trouble comes if you are a saint of God what that trouble does that trouble is a challenge to the supernatural not only don't believe they don't believe the trouble are you gonna believe the supernatural God because the only thing cancer did cancer awakened a revelation that was down inside of me called Jehovah Rapha and without that cancer I'd never know he was a healer now what are you going through and what is God trying to awaken in your life hallelujah you know sometimes chaos is the will of God hooya sometimes when they look like things are completely out of oil in your life it's God doing something yeah and some of you looking like look let me like huh well let me ask you something who would you rather get that credit to God or the devil because if you give that to the devil what you're saying is that the devil has his hand on me huh and the prophet of God said if you have the Holy Ghost Satan can't make you do anything you have to surrender your will to him oh yeah then the prophet of god said if satan could make you do anything with you having the Holy Ghost he says he has to be your brother that me he's had to get back there where God at and say now I want you to do this but that's not according to the scripture according to the scripture hallelujah he says hey devil what you doing he say I'm going to and fro he says hey have you could still look at God sending the trouble he says hey have you considered my servant job and the devil says of course I have but you got a heads around him I can't get tall don't you know trouble can't get to you unless God allows it [Applause] cows can't come to your doorstep unless God allows it Tom okay come to your children trouble can't come to your wife trouble can't come to your husband Tommy can't come to your church your job your family whatever years unless God allows it you know we do we stupid Satan's power we're stripping him tonight because he's not as powerful as we made him to be only power he has is perversion and you know perversion is perversion is taking was already established and twisting it and just in case you didn't realize Satan doesn't even have his own vocabulary he has to take what God has already spoken he has to take what God has already spoken and twist it that's why he came to even say has God said because there's only one author of the word whoo yeah in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the word became fish Satan doesn't even have his own vocabulary he's a pervert and he comes and he says has God said if thou be in all these things all he's doing is taking what God has already presented he's trying to make trouble out of it but let's catch this one thing I want you to realize before you go from anything before you go through any test let's look at how God thinks about it let's look at job for a second before job went through that test oh yeah before he went through that trial Satan said yeah I wanted them I wasn't get to him but I can't you got heads around and then he says hey let me get a hold of them that this is what the trouble is all about he says let me get a hold of him and I guarantee you he'll crush you to your face now I wonder what you doing when you going through your trouble you could be failing the test by the way you act when you're going through your troubles now no we all act different hallelujah but you know hallelujah when I'm on the airplane I like to try to take that I like to try to take the the behavior or the make up of the pilot because they know what they bite the fly into think hear the radio they can hear from the on the tower all these different things about how far is gonna be out so when they get to the trouble they take up some time they out there playing English Connect for talk to being worried about the trouble because they have a destination and they believe they're gonna get there huh but you know for us some of us who are back there behind the seat those of us who are behind the seat when we get in that plane it I've even heard people call that Jesus in those times people that don't go to church people that anything about the Lord just a little bit of trouble there but those violence you know those pilots are doing they're just coasting on through they don't even put their hands on the control they keep it in autopilot and you know what our problem is some of us want to put our hands on the steering wheel but tonight I want everybody to put it back in Jesus hands let's put everything back on autopilot huh let's put everything back old dust head the Lord hooyah let's stop trying to do it ourselves and just say god I'm depending on you because faith is a very powerful element and you will never come through a storm if you don't have any faith oh yeah and you know Hurley the pilot may be flying the plane but once that door closes me and him got the same face y'all realize that once that doors close and everybody get up in there you got equal faith cuz the door is closed what's measuring the faith everybody's in the same vehicle everybody's going to the same place everybody's at the same altitude haruya so the pilot can come to me and say I got more faith in you I say prove it what makes it right greater than mine is it the stripes on his shirt no dang don't do it see according to the vehicle with the same now let me drop something on you Church hallelujah you know God sent us a prophet and God gave him a vehicle to preach call the Word of God oh yeah and you know there was a woman in Memphis Tennessee who said I'm just like that suit of mine now where is my Elisha she found her place in the scripture hallelujah where she could see one part of the word and she said if I'm this part of the world where is the rest of Who I am the Prophet said is the word seeing the word booyah she turns when you find yourself in troubles you need to find yourself in the scripture and what made that story so special was because the prophet of God said haruya that the shooter might and the Prophet Elisha were of the same caliber we were all the same caliber so let me let me say it t like this church the Bible says that the word came to a prophet haruya the word always comes to the Prophet is that not God's Way now hallelujah that's the said the law amen now the question is who does the Prophet come to [Applause] if Jesus comes to that prophet holy jesus is in that prophet earlier and then that Jesus in that prophet comes to people who's coming to you he's just a man we call William Branham but no is God manifested in the flesh holier and it's time for us to take our eyes off of man and realize that it was God doing something honey and you know church with a message like this I can just bet Harry I can really feel God breaking every chain and you know when you think about your troubles if you're a person that's bitter if there's something about your life that's not under the blood we're gonna talk about it tonight we go sniff it out tonight because a lot of times Dean was like to come to church in hide they want to sit in their troubles and be all miserable they want to come to tighten and start the growth of the atmosphere anything the ones that bother me doing the worship service the songs are up there honors this big old movie stream and you sit there like this [Music] we sing it we going up yonder there's something in your spirit that's not connecting with the revelation the inspiration of that song you're letting your troubles get the best of you when your troubles is supposed to bring you closer to God there's not a place in the scripture where the Saints were ever in trouble that it didn't bring God closer [Applause] you found me a place where trouble came in the believers life and they got for sucking my god every bit of trouble that ever came brought god I'm seeing huh and God loves to put us in the midst of chaos because it's scriptural the Bible says in Genesis 1 it says that the earth holier and God created the heavens and the earth and it was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep total chaos but what did that chaos do all of that darkness all that chaos he calls God to respond well all that voice I'm gonna make up a word voidness got into school teachers in here forgive me of course you can see that I'm I'm not politically correct I'm a different message preacher because I believe that the message is gone from just books and tapes I believe that the message now are a people the message is walking upright you know you laying on the table no more they laying on the shelf oh you don't need to see you play but the message got shoes on now the message got tires round the neck message got skirts on now this whole Poli the message got curls hallelujah cuz that what the Bible says is no longer written in the tables of stone but now it's written on the fleshly hearts of the believer you are the message hallelujah [Applause] yeah you know what yeah yeah I know you know it's been doors closed because I believed it but that don't bother me oh yeah we don't take anything away from a prophet when you believe the message came for you [Applause] again the word came to the Providence in the profit came to who me I don't know about you but it came to me and what did it come to do it came to separate me from my troubles so your troubles doesn't define you who you what defines you is how you go through the storm so how the bible says a righteous man falls seven times when he gets back up again see there's not enough trouble in his life to keep him down but there's something inside it says I shall rise I shall rise I shall rise I shall rise why because He is risen [Applause] [Music] hello some of y'all think he just too radical will leave me alone I like me in this way let me explain something to you I wasn't born and bred in a Pentecostal church when morning Barry the Baptist Methodist what you see is a direct product of the message of the some of you guys know the Word of God the message of the hour this is why I laugh and all these people who've left and now they say we're so free we're experiencing God's love we free what makes them free hallelujah what makes them free in their own eyes is simple they don't have to be hypocrite anymore you have to act like they believe something they didn't believe so now what they're saying I'm free to be a hog I'm free to be a pig I'm free to be a Jezebel the reason why they don't want this message is simple because it separates you from the falseness it won't allow you to live in the world and live for God there's a dividing line hallelujah so if you got a problem in your flesh hallelujah this message deals with it [Applause] hallelujah huh but when we look at the trouble that God bring chaos total chaos the Bible says it was without forming without boys he says he was darkness that's over the face of deep and so forth but then what did all that darkness and chaos and voidness do it calls God to speak I got a church in here tonight do I got a church in here cuz I got somebody in here who know what it means when God speaks hello to know that everything changes when God speaks no matter how dark no matter how messy no matter how stale when God speaks everything changes [Applause] and observed most of you are used to coming to church on a Saturday night amen brother Diggs we love Saturday and you come here because you're used to that's the wrong attitude see what I want you to understand y'all notice I brother Louie cut it off because God's presence is here God's presence is here and I want you to realize tonight honey if you come with the right attitude what you've been praying about can be a reality tonight that healing can be a reality tonight Polly I challenge you hallelujah be like John Ryan stand on your feet and say take the Lord for healing me she's our trouble holy his blindness thought God on the scene but in a supernatural way against all doubt hallelujah and it may have talked earlier several days hallelujah but God let the trouble go he let the trouble go knowing that there was a purpose in church what I want you to realize that this miracle was not only for the church people but the witnesses was in a barber shop [Applause] could it be what you going through hallelujah we'll help some silligan same ooh yeah you know your family members your unsaved loved ones they're watching you how you go through this trouble and Satan oh yeah he stands back he's thinking things I got the price I got nothing God sitting this God said they listened to him and then God reminds him he says because I let you and then Satan wants to use that he says okay okay you ain't got to show off okay okay I'll understand god I'm backing up I'm backing up I know you got all this under control but just let me have my moley and then God is sitting over here he's the same talking so what moment you ain't got no moment what you doing is what I'm telling you to do don't charge we ought to realize that whatever the devil is doing God has allowed it cuz there's the purpose holy the Bible says before a Jacob and Esau even born God loved one and he hated one why because of the purpose one had to be a size two huh Leah amen one had had to not have recompense for the reward but all of that was God's purpose why because in take earlier there was a nation so that was a certain way his life had to go he had to experience trouble why because it was a nation in size earlier and you know that that trouble hallelujah all the things he was experiencing was gonna name those boys you are a Reuben you are is it ha you are Joseph you are Benjamin holder there wasn't just names but those names but their adoption and God let all those things happen he let him and he he let Jacob uh uh run into trouble with his brother brother come everybody all right time is never on my side that's why I'm glad I'm not a creature of time I hope there's more people in here like me tonight because if you haven't realized we're in that span where it says and time shall be no more when he begins to sound he sounded so we should be living in another place when we come to church how many of us how many of us come to church and we and we drive a stake down and we say God ain't leave until you bless me we ought to mean business hallelujah this is not just some religious gathering some religious affair Church we have an audience with God he's wanting to respond to your trouble but let me make it real to you because of the way God dealt with me in my life my Bell or one of my greatest battles it's always my finances because I live by faith I'm not connected to oh you know I said money don't grow on trees boy I wish I had one brother I take good care that tree boy every time you see me I'd be out there watering that you making sure the sunlight shining down on it do whatever I got to do I run the bird I'd be out there with a pellet gun shoot get off my tree cuz that tree is important to me but you know church you know if you I just want you to step into my world for a second and you know the way God did this you know I didn't want to be a preacher I didn't want God knows I didn't want to be a full time preacher cuz you know what my problem was I was used to that forty hours a week I ain't need no faith for that I only had to do was show up do that both bill and I get bless any talk much faith for that regard you know what I want you to quit the job well god no is that you huh huh father so I think can't be gone tell him you could I got a family then the voice comes again I want you to quit the job Lord you gave me this job is a good job only work four days a week I'm off every Wednesday and Saturday hey mr. Church why quit God is stirring up the nest and it blows me away to this day even when you bring it for a fruit he'll purge you that you bring forth more fruit it don't matter who you is don't y'all think for one second that brother Donna don't get purged brother deeds don't get purged I broke my chair brother Terry don't get purged huh don't you think for one second because we're preachers are we will it look like we're in the will of God that there's no trouble got us in trouble because there's a purpose inside Ian there's something inside of you he's trying to get out hurry up so even when you're bringing forth fruit even when you're in the will of God God will make it look like you ain't in his will and you mrs. believers start talking about me he got his car broke down how can that be the will of God [Music] Danny up for you to decide what you see with your eyes don't tell the story oh yeah what tells the story is my end hallelujah hey so you can see me go through something that you can't explain look like it's off the scripture but it's God's will no I'm not advocating sin what I'm saying is what most of us need to learn how to do more often is shut up keep our thoughts to ourself if you ain't got nothing good to say don't say nothing at all but we're in a day where God didn't come to take away too long he came to magnify the law so instead of saying if you ain't got nothing good to say don't say nothing at all we're gonna magnify brother hair if you think I've nothing good to think don't think nothing at all walk around like a zombie [Applause] viewing and then good to think about we see people going through stuff and in media we start thinking negative oh oh she doesn't oh he doesn't oh the brothers just and the brother that you never thought about maybe God is in control Church so that the purpose of God could be fulfilled God let a little young girl go into prostitution her name was Rahab oh yeah God never going to prostitution why oh yeah because she had to meet a general in the army and from that zero they had to have a boy ass and from that boy they had to have a Jesse from that Jesse a Damon from baby Jesus [Applause] so God let her go through the trouble so she could be a blessing to us and you look at all the critics just seeing that below processing know she was one in the lineage of Jesus Christ and everybody else looking at her trouble but our troubles for purpose doctor Oh hallelujah even before they got to her you know the problem I'm feeling good now you like the prophets say I'm feeling religious don't blame it on me some brothers with me at the doing this and we gonna treat you to death tonight don't blame me blame them cuz that we're gonna pull oh yeah I said I'd like to be told don't see y'all talking my language but trust you look at hustling yeah the journey from the word of this I mean from from from Egypt to the promised land the Prophet said it was three to five days but then some people started complaining and saw all the miracles honey they didn't experience any oh let's back up before they got there before there was ever Moses what brought Moses on the scene trouble chaos getting whipped didn't beat ain't allowed the worship all that trouble and chaos what did it do it calls to church people who knew they had a promise to cry out and that trouble begins a crowd for a God of deliverance what is your trouble doing in your life I hope it ain't making you thinking about quitting church cuz that ain't the purpose of the purpose is to bring you closer the purpose is to help you experience the supernatural let me say tonight could that could what you goin through Holly tonight before this night closed this night for you to reach out and grab your blessing home like I said the devil he asked God for permission says let me mess up his finances but he don't realize the more he messes it up the more faith I have for growing - and I've been full-time evangelist for about eight years now and I ain't got it right I still you know it's just like why cross beat I get in a tight spot that tight spot right now I get it tight spot I'm like Laura what should i do what should i do and gods like shut up all this time I didn't bless you I don't have people come up to you and give you money and you asking me what am i what am I gonna do you don't do what you always don't believe me [Applause] just a couple weeks ago I'm gonna take your testimony for those of y'all for those of y'all who God put somebody on your heart you always say well bless this brother with $20 no that's too easy we don't start with a hungry here we start getting spiritual they don't look like they need none God he acts you that he likes you that remember he told the woman hallelujah pray for the baby and she's looking like no she's here for brother Brendan ray for the baby and God kept saying pray for the baby she's like no well you know what I give him my seat and she thought that voice is gonna live up she gave the woman in the baby to see and the voice still said pray for the baby God tell us to do something we start asking our questions God comes and say pray for sister saw pray for brothers saw so put something in brother song so hands and we like Lord you show is that you well that's clearly something I don't never wanna I don't never want us to wrestle with this again it's never listened to me it's never repeat after me it's never the gavel telling us to bless somebody we should never wrestle with that again because it's never the devil telling you to pray for somebody it's never to the devil telling you to financially bless somebody is devil the devil telling you to encourage somebody it's always God so we shouldn't have the Russell with that tonight always to do is be obedient oh just be honest to say God I don't want to have you do that you in trouble cuz I guarantee you whatever he tell you to do you won't enjoy it I can't I come up with my own little proverb I was I was thinking you know think about that and I just came for my kids and I was thinking and God began to deal with me something so I went on one of those social media things that I know that and then I went on then I put in something that's it and it goes like this put God first and he will bless you put God second and he will show you that he should have been first [Applause] I don't know about you but it's always worked in my life anytime I've ever put God second he showed me boy I should have been first time I've ever put him first I was always blessed even in the midst of your troubles hallelujah we got to run the garden prayer church I'm gonna tell your testimony I was a couple of weeks ago I went to church to preach and you know like I said it you know we live in my faith we living off the gospel we don't know what's gonna happen we just believe in God I don't I see a like one of them regular preachers like I think be hey yo I got script to say he owns a cat alone a thousand not one here of Thousand Hills when I still hold out of cattle so when I ask God for something I don't ask in a small room cuz he's a big God to me the image in my mind and my god oh yeah he ain't six feet tall he ain't seven feet tall he ain't feet tall he about a hundred feet tall he's a big God to me so I don't go to God's Way in Lord you know father I'm trying to evangelize and I just need me a piece of you get what you ask for then you get that piece of car and a car breaking down oh I saw sickness thought he gave me what you asked for you actual piece of car nobody gave you a lot I'm so sick of this apartment I just need me a little small house and you go get a little eight hundred square feet house and then you start saying I should have stayed in my apartment he gave me what you asked for don't you understand as the bride as children of God when you speak God listens when you speaking this sentence when you ask he does but you know I was somewhere preaching and Dean out the service you know means a couple of brothers are talking brother came up to me he said so I'm gonna give you just some change some change I need it and you know I ain't trying to hack off super spiritual like someone's do no brother I'm good I'm all right I'm sure I'm trusting the Lord brother brother I'm good you know we're good with that false humility trying to act humble know you in need that get on my nerves with all that false humility you come unto me saying the Lord the Lord told me to give you this you think I'm gonna say no brother I'm good I said a lot but god bless you brother [Applause] the Lord said told him to do that the Lord told her to do that and we with all those false humility you know I'm just trusting a little I'm praying about it God else in your prayers [Applause] anyway brother come up to me he says oh mama give us huh god bless you thank the Lord for you he says you know I'm gonna buy a truck tomorrow I sold all my other trucks I think you buy me another work truck or whatever kind of truck he was gonna buy he says but God told me bless you and that truck that calls 42,000 I let you get it for 10 see we should already be shout cuz I've noticed Oregonian good Oh y'all think i'ma tell you this but for me to say oh he didn't get no we know how God worked if God told you he was gonna do something he's gonna fulfill it so you know what church huh he said God told me get you this and here let me get that truck for ten thousand $42,000 oh boy here take some faith to believe God like that you know how much you know how much faith it take to believe God like Nike just do it that's the only thing if God is expressing himself just do it you got the Huff and pray Oh father ah diesel I need you to come on the scene come on down me like you got dueling all you gotta do is say Lord you thank you lord just do it he might not be telling nobody else to do it you do what he tell you to do and if he telling you to do something it ain't gonna cost confusion in the church oh yeah we had to get down without cause some people waiting to do something I put this on my heart mess up everything if God telling you to do it it ain't gonna cost confused because he's not the author of confusion [Applause] hallelujah so this brother he gives me some money and I said god bless you we hugging embracing everything he says now I just believe God he said the Lord told me to give you this and he was gonna let me get this truck for ten thousand so he says hey tomorrow when I go get this truck i'ma call you with the testimony I said all right so what I needed the money folks he got it so good the Lord no I needed the money for a certain thing so when I got the money I went in took care of business I had to take care of and as soon as I finished spending it he called me he said hey but these are you doing I just start smiling without doing good blasts highly favored too blessed to be stressed he's a saint remember I told you what the Lord told me to do for you I said yeah he said well you know what I wouldn't stop being on the truck he said we started bidding on the truck and the last bid was my being you know what it was it was $9,500 he said that after I paid the taxes it was even ten thousand just like God's sake now who go tell that brother that God don't keep his word if God ever moves in your life like that who's gonna tell you not to obey that voice and who's gonna tell a person like me huh that's telling like they're all alone that God will take care and you know it's a process and the reason why you know and I go through it over and over and over and over you know Stan Eagle I'm speaking to your standing knee but you know what God is doing Church for those of you who get sick and you get sick and you get sick and you get sick and you get healed and you can heal then you get healing in heal you know why because God is perfecting that revelation a lot of the Bible says earlier its business is he's a cannon oh joy we follow the dollars of things he said count your child more precious than gold tried in the fire go deity fire God so everything about this trial is God and what God does he lets us go through it brings us out go through it brings us out go through it brings us out what is he doing he's perfecting it and you know what I do know what I believe he's doing for me it's gonna get to a place where I ain't even gonna be thinking about my final I'll be like that's all you got God will provide he don't make me nervous it'll be know what I'm doing what I'm gonna do no he didn't done it so much tonight he's perfect it's like a person gets a revelation of healing see I'm there when it comes to healing ain't they own finances yet so there might be some areas you perfected and I ain't perfected yeah and there may be some areas that I perfected that you in perfecting yet but by God's grace we all gonna get there but when it comes to healing holy that's not a challenge for me they told me I coughs I said no I don't they told me I had diabetes I said no I don't got beans revelation and one day the devil had the audacity to try to sneak attack me - Nick attacked me when I least expected I'm going to renew my license and people say well you got to take a fields gonna keep your CDL in and take those things I'm gonna take the physical and people say you got high blood pressure doesn't walk just in case you let that means me that's like me high blood pressure so yeah you got a blonde say no I don't say yes you do I said no I don't and you know Satan looks they have a streaming match but I can get louder than he came when it comes to healing he says yes you do I said in the name of Jesus no I don't say yes you do how they buy stripes I'm healed no I don't and say yes to do ya say he's the LORD thy God that healeth thee from all thy diseases so the most Satan come the louder I get because I got no revelation so you know what doctor comes in Isis and reinforcements he comes in with his book and all the stuff he says well mr. deeds you got high blood pressure I said we got to do this again i say no i don't he says well this is what we can do I can give you a one-year card and you come back because you got high blood pressure or you can retake the test see Satan always want you to settle for less than what I was supposed to get was two years and you know what I told my saying we gonna take the test over I ain't afraid to put my guard on see I ain't afraid to say that this trouble has come to bring in the supernatural Oh God don't make believers out of the nurse out of the doctor out of the Clark even the people in the white room hello so she rolled me back in there hook the machine back up the thing start acting crazy in I'll do all kind of stuff trying to play with your mind I say thing you can huff and puff you can blow up I ain't got no high blood pressure you don't scare me with your tricks and your antics devil I got a promise and the promise says rise pipes I'm here now I don't have to do nothing to work that up God said that oh my god do believe it you know Tyler she hooked me back up she the things start going crazy then it settles out then she didn't it went out to the DD or whatever it did it went out then she looked at me and she says you're right you don't have high blood I say I've told you that from the get-go let's say like this church maybe all God wants you to do tonight is speaking maybe all the trouble is about putting you in position for the purpose of God to be fulfilled out of your life huh remember there was a prophet who will endure Wars one day and he was in trouble he's looking for hunting game and all these things he couldn't find it why was it so dry why was it so much chaos in trouble because God had put him in position to speak and then it was another day when he he was - on business he was gonna pray for somebody and all of a sudden a bull arose up trouble God put his prophet in the midst of that trouble why so he could see that he was a son God all right whoa I feel the Holy Ghost moving in here now oh yeah God put him in the midst of that hallelujah he didn't know the boy was gonna be there he left his gun in the car huh it was so much trouble the fist was too far away he couldn't run that so he's third day he said well I guess I'm a dying on that like a coward and just speaking that alone the presence of God came in the midst of his trouble the supernatural Oh shitty and you know right there I guarantee if he was he just say I didn't feel like I was in trouble you know why cuz God put him there see the pressure you're feeling you're not supposed to feel when you let God take over remember that was a blizzard the prism everybody else didn't read all other brothers run and guard to him stop go back God that a blizzard come so a prophet could control creation [Music] y'all see y'all good at holding y'all praise I can't do that I got to get mine out Lumi God will allow me to go through things so I can speak to it oh yeah some of us are too quiet God want us to speak to our trouble bring the supernatural in it's who you are first we can go on and on and on with this little mist of all your trouble no you clean us could it be God doing something you know look saul of tarsus just causing trouble havoc all over the place persecuting the church doing all the stuff you know what was going on God was pushing the word into other places so God had to send a man that was gonna persecute them so they wouldn't all stay in the same place but then he wasn't done huh yeah cuz he took that man hugger who was calling so much trouble put him in trouble knock him off his horse huh made him blind honey what was the purpose of the blindness now he has to look through the eyes of God I just love God's God has a sense of you you know and then you know the church people they don't believe God can save anybody they don't believe God could save her brother cadre deeds but I'm saved amen and don't plan on being unsaved no matter what trouble I go through I believe he's a keeper oh yeah and now that I'm looking through a different lens I have to look at my troubles my trials my situations as a blessing oh my one I challenge you tonight how many of us are sitting in here saying lord I thank you for my troubles and hard doing it scripture job how long will you continue to hold on to your integrity he says the Lord God giveth and the Lord God taketh away blessed be the name of the law Joe I'm just so sick Hollis you're going through and you just st. pay me no attention you bat me no jess is a nittany you just why don't you just curse God and die now that was his heart that was his partner and I see got trouble on her she calls him Oh pressure Joseph woman you speak it as the foolish women you expect to receive all good and no evil at the hand of the Lord you mean God controls evil too so the devil's own even control evil God turns it loose don't let that be a stumbling block now there'd be no evil if there was no God because evil shows his goodness if there was no sickness there be no healing if there was nobody lost there be no Savior if there was nobody bound there'd be no deliverer hallelujah so if there was no trouble there'd be no need for a mighty God so the prophet of God said holy all these things called out his attributes [Applause] now what attribute is he tried to express in the midst of your trouble now I don't know about you but in my case Jehovah Jireh I know you trying to give me more patient more patient oh I wish I just had a borrower patience I could drink get full office every time I get inside play a pack a patient every time I'm in pressure going down 26 I'm not cutting funny give me that ball pitch don't do what's it worth like that I'll just give it a little stretch today you know I wish I could give my kids the Holy Ghost I wish I could give to I always had a ball our Holy Ghost Jill hug something and every day they come home from school I don't know what time it is it's time to drink this holy God and we start come on right I it won't be no sippin we sip enough you're gonna run all down your face I'm gonna make sure you getting this whole Eagles if I had control of lighting will be like a sorority drink drink right right right right right right [Applause] they told me to be myself and you know they'd be come home from school I do it so much before they hit Italy say hey y'all know what time it is daddy do you know y'all know daddy gonna be waiting on us he got some more that wholly-owned everyone out of that Holy Ghost he always getting more of it so we might we're just going in and drink up you know I'd love to get the one that don't look like they want it you trying to run for me come you can get extra to get to a place where they start desiring it they love the taste of it hallelujah they see the benefits of it once against in a system dr. mighty Lord I wish I had bottles of the Holy Ghost I give some of you in tonight but I want to tell you I can give it to you but it's here if you only is here Bible says as Peter speak these words the Holy Ghost fell only he's here Church in my I'm about to go don't get nervous and I may say that three more times I said I was about to I didn't say I was sorry I don't have a lying spirit on me but you know when you look at your troubles and you look at what you're going through you think it's total chaos could it be like I said we back up and we see the children of Israel crying and they cried out they're here come on Moses that trouble brought o Moses on the scene didn't they stop holy Moses brought them out of Egypt big marches then somebody else started some more trouble I'm hungry had to throw up the whole church cuz somebody took my day hungry three day journey oh gosh slow up the whole church just to feed them not only feed them but get the momentum from heaven give them bread nobody else that ever tasted do y'all understand because this world Holly the church world was in such so much trouble that God stopped the whole church Hurley and pulls out a bride and gave us bread nobody else has ever tasted oh we never fresh from heaven no Catholic has ever tasted no Pentecostal has ever tasted no Baptists has ever tasted oh yeah no seven-day Infinitis has ever tasted no Muslim no way this know no man's ever tasted oh yeah green bread that hasn't even been in the stores it ain't even on the book sales in the Christian bookstores [Music] [Applause] you are special people you see what this trouble did this trouble pulled out God's oh and then we start marching he did some Oh trouble started somebody else I'm thirsty go ahead slow the whole church up again but this time he said you want something to drink I'm gonna give you water hallelujah that's never been in bottles I'm looking your water that's never been in a river hallelujah imma give you water that ain't coming from a whale I am give you water that ain't coming from a fountain i'ma give you water from me tell ya I'm gonna get water from the rock hallelujah drink up this water and you never thirst again Church I stand to be corrected but go back and look at it oh yeah after that oh you have a God getting water for the rock did you ever hit him back for water again he can fulfill your thirst but they they stop marching they stop complaining you know three days turned into 30 days 30 days turn into three years three years turn into 13 years 23 years do y'all realize they were marching in a circle and they kept coming to their way out but they kept complaining so he kept going in circles they kept coming back to the same old point and they couldn't accident but they kept complaining come to the same on point they couldn't exit but they kept complaining and some of us God has bought child deliverance but we keep complaining [Applause] [Music] let's stop complaining and believe God let the night be your victory that you won't look at your trouble like that anymore and why 40 years you know God was in control you know the purpose behind he said 40 yeah he wanted to kill all of you no it was more than that he had to be 40 years because if it was a three days journey of five days journey rehab wasn't ready she was a teenager so it had to go X amount of years so she could be born she could grow up she can get a house she can get into her thing and then she can hear what God was doing [Music] so a lot of times your trouble is there to bless somebody else you just got to go through it right listen I know I got a real cool cuz I know some of you ain't right no cult I didn t believe the message and told y'all I am the message I am the course holder the quotes in here we don't talk about that tomorrow [Applause] listen that's what a prophecy is he says the preaching of the Cross brings observation it brings troubles it brings stirrups and we can't expect to be immune from all those we just have to take them as they come because God has a purpose so I want you to look at your troubles as a victory tonight anybody going through something say praise the Lord that means God is doing something in your life well you might look at it but I go through I got an addiction I got this I got that I don't know what to do what I do turn it over to the Lord come a B he allowed you to go again allowed you to go through that sweet come on C remember he told his disciples he said see I'm trying to close but y'all pulling blame brothers again remember he told his disciples let us go to the other side and then he went to pray or whatever you went to doing I went up on the mountain to pray those different times you know he got the praying didn't went out there storm king trouble king water in the boat we go die that's the first thing we think when we get a little bit of trouble and then all of a sudden in the mist all that trouble become Jesus doing something in their life that they never seen before what calls Jesus to come like that the trouble it was a purpose behind that trouble hallelujah amen was a purpose behind that storm and you need cry now he's a ghost we go dies the spirit and Jesus said be not afraid I want you to kiss this church sometimes God allows things just to get you to pray cuz we had no trouble someone wouldn't even pray so God God let us let us go through things so we could find that secret place when I tell you it ain't nothing like that secret place when you get in there you know it ain't nobody there but you and God you know what in there ain't even no trouble in there it's over I want you to believe it's over the trouble is over tonight you can rejoice you were drivin your pool you can rejoice yeah amen and you know Jesus come walking on the water say he said be not afraid in his eye and do you Peter Tapia forgot about his trouble he forgot about his trouble he start to think on who God is see the winds and the waves couldn't stop his revelation of who God was your trouble shouldn't be able to stop your revelation of who God is oh yeah and all the trouble of the winds the waves all those things Peter say God if he's you pick me come all Jesus animals one thing come on that here in this trouble with me come on I'll show you how much power it is come on I hit with people jumped out the boat hugly I can see him hardly he probably was even thinking about the water one thing about net all he did was kept his eyes on Jesus he joked that during that water the water solid he started walking towards Jesus he didn't see any more trouble anymore all he did was saw Jesus and as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus everything was peace but as soon as he started looking at his trouble he's starting to sink he started to fall and he's darling Rita save me don't you realize he was i dead all alone and god grabs him and pulls him up as long as you keep your eyes on him the trouble have no effect on you amen either have no effect and you know sometimes god I put you in trouble because there's something inside he wants he let David commit premeditated murder adultery plus why he did all that why why he let David go through all that trouble so he can repent and he didn't get Psalm 51 out of create in me a clean [Music] Oh God and renew a right spirit within me that song would've never came with that that encounter with Bathsheba so God allow all that trouble so we could sing that song today cast me not away from that present Sokka take not thy Holy Spirit from me all that come from David's trouble cigar let David go through all that why cuz he had the Book of Psalms in the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that's God's Way he allowed things to come so things and you can come out and don't you realize he allowed Paul to persecute the church why cuz he said he's a chosen fell so he let him go through all that trouble he was night and day in the sea I think he's I think you say he's whipped over five times he was thrown over the wall all these things bit by fire hey man all that stuff was going on why because there was a purpose you know what it was hallelujah the purpose was in power there was a book of Romans there was a book of Corinthians there was an emphasis there was a Galatians oh it was a Hebrews oh that was wrapped up in Paul so Paul had to go through some trouble so God can get it out there was a purpose church don't you realize half of the New Testament was written why powers in jail and then he says and by the way bring me my coat come on musicians I'm closing walk out of here tonight different look at your trouble and smile because God is doing something now it'll be hard if you start thinking about it don't think about it just believe that God allowed it we said doesn't know how did I get I don't know don't do nothing don't do nothing don't try to look at the outcome and when it's gonna happen just believe just believe like the Bible says this is what the Bible says listen to me good turn old man this is just so fresh this would be good now the Bible says trouble don't last always so yours could be ending tonight I don't know about you but I believe my I can in tonight my financial balcony tonight the Holy Ghost it's all about children tonight cuz I have a promise that trouble don't last always amen so let's look at things different God called Abraham when he was an old man why so he could show him the power of redemption so he could show him that the sickness and the deadness of his body couldn't stop the purpose of God and Sarah looking at the trouble she said oh I'm old and I'm dissing I can't I can't I can't imagine me in my lord hahahaha and God like what you laughing for always gonna happen it's gonna happen you might not think he's gonna have my Sarah it's gonna happen to you [Applause] [Music] and what if God is saying that to you tonight it's gonna happen and it's gonna happen to you cuz you believe because there's a purpose in your life in the midst of your storm there's a purpose the devil gets no credit it is no cream now we're gonna exalt the Lord you know cuz he loves to be worshipped Perley your brother God saying after the word is delivered that's the time to worship and you know sometimes in our seats as our hands are lifted the presence of God begins to follow us think about it your trouble brought you to a service tonight to hear your deliverance and if y'all don't mind there's a song I just love to see there's a song I love to sing and it just it just it
