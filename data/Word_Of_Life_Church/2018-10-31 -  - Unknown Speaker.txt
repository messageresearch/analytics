TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but unless I know that I know that I know that you're with me I can't go another day I can't go forward I can't go and make any progress Lord I've got to know you're there and you'll never leave me and you'll never forsake me and your abiding presence is with me before I go forward Lord because without your presence it is nothing more than a man-made attempt at serving God and I say to you today that unless your Christianity has the presence of Jesus Christ in it then your Christian life is nothing more than a man-made attempt at being good unless your life has the presence of God in it unless my life is backed up by a living God I have nothing more than a dress code a rule book of do's and don'ts and a lager a self-help book on how to be a better person how about how to how about how to influence people and how to how to live a good clean life oh but my brother I don't want that just here tonight I want my life not just to be a life of what I do and what I don't do I wanted to be a breathing God who breathed upon my life a literal reality that I hold within my soul if your presence isn't with me every day of my life then Lord it's not worth it it doesn't matter the ups or the downs it doesn't matter the highs are the lows let the presence of God abide with me always look at first verse 15 again and he said unto Him at thy presence going out with me carry us up not hence he was saying Lord if your presence is not with me I'm not going anywhere I won't take another single step unless I have an assurance we need to get to that place with the Lord but I believe some of us need to get to that place with the Lord just say Lord you want me to go forward but I ain't going forward unless you're with me oh it was a desperation for Moses it was like Jacob who can say I'm not leaving until you bless me until I know I'm different until I know I've been changed oh I can hear about it I can confess it I can read your word or what it says but Jacob said I've got to know I've been changed I'm different I'm not the person I used to be I'm not leaving until you bless me Lord always the song says I won't be denied I'm gonna get my blessing and if I have to stay here you'll find my bones at this altar but I'm gonna receive my blessing from the Lord because I can't live without him I can't serve or walk this Christian life without him I can't go forward unless you go with me Moses says don't even carry us up if your presence is not with me don't even send me
