[0:00] let me just tell you friends while this
[0:02] coronavirus and all this is going on on
[0:05] the earth and people are tore all to
[0:07] pieces and scared to death and let me
[0:09] just remind you God's prophet said it
[0:12] read it today and I shared it with a few
[0:14] folks that God's prophet said the worst
[0:16] thing the devil could ever put on you
[0:20] was fear fear is worse than cancer fear
[0:28] is worse than the flu it's worse than
[0:31] the coronavirus it's worse than any
[0:35] virus that there is down inhale and the
[0:38] Prophet goes on to say even if you had
[0:40] cancer if you did not fear it you
[0:44] wouldn't be in too bad a shape so don't
[0:47] go running around here and I can lock a
[0:49] bunch of people that ain't been told the
[0:52] Word of God when calamity comes what do
[0:55] we do we behave ourselves as sons and
[0:58] daughters of God sure
[1:01] wash your hands cover your mouth do all
[1:04] the sensible things but don't let the
[1:06] devil put fear on you because it won't
[1:09] just stop with the coronavirus you'll
[1:12] start fearing this and fearing that and
[1:14] fearing something else God has not given
[1:17] us the spirit of fear but of love and
[1:21] power and a sound
[1:27] now sure wash your hands be sensible I'm
[1:31] the one who bought those things out
[1:32] there
[1:33] for you to put your hands under you know
[1:35] germs are like Jesus they're everywhere
[1:38] so it's sensible to wash your hands and
[1:41] do all that sort of thing but don't let
[1:43] fear grab ahold to you look what it's
[1:45] doing to the world look what it's done
[1:48] to the stock market look what it's done
[1:50] to the people what brother Donnie
[1:52] shouldn't we take care of sure we should
[1:54] take care but I live that way every day
[1:56] of my life I take care every day I think
[1:59] that's the way we ought to live but I
[2:01] think it displeases the Lord when we let
[2:04] the media when we let the newspaper when
[2:07] we let us whether it's fox or CNN or CS
[2:12] NBC whoever it is scare the live around
[2:14] us we forget who we are we are God's
[2:19] children at the time of storm we are
[2:21] God's children at a time of pandemic we
[2:24] are God's children in the time of
[2:27] trouble because we're children by his
[2:32] blood
[2:33] [Applause]
