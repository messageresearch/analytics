Yesterday's Gone oh my sins are forgiven I I've been washed by his love [Music] dear heavenly father we come to you today Lord and boldly like your word says and I looked around and says Brother Louie asked for the unspoken request seemed like every hand went up but also with that whenever he asked everyone that has had something that the Lord's done for them every hand went up as well so we just see that Lord knowing that even though we have requests you have the answer in every situation and the same God that drove away the fear from our sister Becky is the same one that can drive every need everything from us Lord Jesus every request is in your hands Lord God I pray right now you send a special blessing to Erica right now Lord God you see where she's at Lord God you see this devil that's attacking her but the same thing that can drive away fear is the same thing that can drive away cancer they can drive away any disease any sickness anything like that Lord God I pray right now to him the father you just move in such a mighty way and be with whoever's speaking the night Lord God just may they be able to step out of the way and just use them Lord God but more importantly use us to pull on that Lord God because if we're not working with him Lord God it's all in vain Lord Jesus I pray pray you be with the remainder of the service and just have your way little God Amen praise the

[Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I was just watching some footage of those ukrainians fighting in those the battle against Russia I've watched several footage there in the last couple weeks and there's one instance they had to retreat they got to where they was overwhelmed butter [Music] opposition but you know what the next day they was out there fighting and I thought you know that's the way it is as humans sometimes we go through things and we get feel like a devil's making a step backwards but then the Holy Spirit and God's anointing comes on us and it gives us some ammunition that we can fight for the next day and I'm so thankful that's what we're going to sing about I'm so thankful I could put a scroll across this entire audience and I couldn't come up with enough thanks in my heart for what God's done for me and I'm sure you feel the same way when I look look around and see the good things he does for me I know I'm Unworthy of them all and His blessings he just freely gives I owe all my life to him I've got so much to think info and I've got so much to thank and pour so much to praise him for you see he has been so good to me oh and I think of what is [Applause] brought me from I've got so much to thank him for sometimes [Music] along this way I knew I stop and say thank you Lord for all you've done for me oh one day I'll reach oh sweet Heaven's short oh please let me kneel once more I've got so much to thank him for and I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you he's been so good to me oh when I say of what is done and where he's brought me from I've got so much to think info [Music] sometimes while on this way I know I'll stop and I say thank you Lord for all you've done for me cause one day I'll reach sweet Heaven sure oh please let me kneel once more I've got so much to thank him oh help me sing it and I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see he has been so good to me I know what I think of what he's done and where he's brought me from I've got so much to think him pull right sing it one more time and I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you sing it's been so good to me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and when I think of what is done and where he's brought me from I've got so much to think helpful [Music] [Applause] said and senator in my own side was that would not make ahead and tries and the Lord sent me on the journey and he said come with utterly destroy the sinners The Knockouts and fight against sin until May he be concerned now that's two or three words make a difference to God so if God would have just said find us suppose we did the perfectly elongated the word foreign the Lord God's Prophet alive I've obeyed the voice of the Lord I have gone away which the Lord sent me and I brought Amen to the king of them how how can they do statements to be put together and say that you'll obey the voice to him it's amazing to have himself however we can do so sometimes and we are so convinced that we arrived and somebody would show us his word and it was just saying all right episode a lot of the Bible says the heart it's such a disease the one for the mercy of God it had zero National in this church including zero beginning with me thank you buddy man I just made it kind of Limitless so we could understand this yes utterly destroyed us but this is a King's wife was now at sea of the king and some years after this will find another God 's praise God remember his name if he was an Old Lady Gaga he would be serious trouble all the hundreds and hundreds of lots of lost because once a law they have the leaves a person's name he's the king himself couldn't change it to fight for themselves but hundreds of them are killed they call us included a message came horribly thought it was so nice we realize father Your Grace is still about true thank you Lord that you're merciful thus we're not talking about Lord we see the path of the elect Ron Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses and Jeremiah we look and see the little neighbor and let us see we're still communities and we see the same about us today we're so grateful it's no mystery Lord that we don't need you oh Lord how you would need us to say of all others I'm grateful that you are here I'm pretty much just take the words of my Lord speak to the same way interested by these examples how grateful we are if you have a Bible written with not only positive sayings but she hadn't written about the errors in the six people so if we agreed them and learn about it and hopefully not with the hands to us so how do you speak to us in that once again by Your Word father it performed the sick people out bad on vacation things you just watch all of them and give us some more seek to his father can we meet people Jesus Christ [Applause] I'm sure I wanted to realize it all of us are responsible to the Lord for the gifts and he gives us the abilities house even the influence that we have all your parents will answer what we have to understand you have on your children we will answer for the influence that maybe some of those older ones have on younger people and it's it's an amazing thing to me having been around for a little while anyway sometimes leaders can get to a spot to where they feel almost an example status of being correct nothing to say foreign [Applause] ation on the Earth the tallest man or something like that happened together into a certain place instead of hungry himself a higher the kid it's long the less they feel they have to answer to anybody I ask you to know no one challenges me no one person they are above the wall but we can see that it runs that way in the world as well this is what of course would happen to Salt the salt in the field that he was at that spot God would use it God had an orange to him and good things that happened when you know that his first king for this thing was just a little bunch of them over again finally some value but there are definitely didn't even clocked like this that is group of Israel together and been able to pull off as we would say long Victory I have to another Factory they were interested pictures it was large and and he would have stayed in this place that he would have on a man he could have knew he could have had a United States but yet because something to get it to happen to me and whatever Central addresses and he he goes to the rude calls and he says because this happened it's all you were little in your own eyes then God chose to be the king and God shows you to be Prince over his people so what happened saying you listen and using this in a parabolic form that something happens that's a solid itself he was no longer lived in his own lives but the name of a massive said that God has a hard time trying to find the man that he can use because he said a lot of man when God wants you do so and another Johnson was there remember this but everybody was standing up and I quoted that quote and brother and said God can caught the man that he can use it and the Lord that he used to see the liver that hits the last opposite the way that people go and the way people sing because many times the more God makes a son and the greater than he uses them the bigger they can come in our lives so as I have voted that because it makes such an impression on me as secretion someone had a lot more to that but the vet said to no one that God will use the man will literally he'll get so when I said that when Johnson had his hands on the back that Peter Griffin had lost this and whenever I said before God uses in the literary edition of the Johnson one like this and then I said her wife said the Lord God Jesus said so there I guess and it just kept my head down so low talking about having these things and there was something about that realist of that book that struck him that I and it shot me because it shut down I was totally had different parts of the world because I saw that quote in a real form that a man called it and realized what it could be and you know that God question answers and he said said man generally wants to become a god or a niche before the people my computer said you're thinking anybody would know how wrong you are you would right out of the Lord would you ever the urination spirit I have never he saw that and he struck that Circle and lived now of course it was from Canada to Georgia and he struck it down shepherdstrom and when he struck with some brothers and spoke to him and he turned around to speak to them brothers and that Bruce serpenter crawled into the water he didn't kill him now he mentions about himself and said that it had bitten him but the blood was so rich he could not take a touch now look how that spirit that did he think could be able to everybody even the rest of us it was himself him and talk to poison his breath would you notice he doesn't say his mind was stronger and his will was strong and his gift but he said the blood was soft what was the brown blood no it wasn't grounded blood it was the blood of Jesus flesh but that thing has been around actually before brother back and made it outside it's something that helps to exalt man in the storm to come to his Christian dog and the life saves the way that a man will make himself God right and he will exalted and saw that Saul exalted and it's above the word of God and he didn't think this word and the back word and that word really isn't it that much if he's just kind of paraphrases what God Said that people have to be word for word well that's what he saw in the Garden of Eden so he would just act out of paraphrasing of what the prophet told him to do and God would accept it that she believed be the city that whatever she said what's wrong so whatever she said it was God and it goes why that was a great figure of course down to the age of succumbed now notice this in first time 15 22 10 I said how come the Lord is praying the line and earned offers and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fan of rain a river nation and a Samuel was both of Levi's and a prophet so he's not moving away within the minute Lord or the sacrifice no matter what we do for God if we don't go back what God says what we do in the order of sacrifice can totally be lost [Applause] sacrifice and the way you look and see that they have saved earlier and that's my husband Into the Book of Matthew and also on the Book of Revelation now notice I wasn't aware of say this as a token full of obedience to the Lord this is the children brains God the word eternal in you as a diet praise God follow me into the word brain saw the word Eternal in you and that is the token when the word is in you is Christ in you now don't say anyone ever we pray we have told him when we pray we have a token or present our company with our prayer so it's not your words it's not how long even in church I'm a pastor's daughter a pastor's son I preached for 50 years I've done this don't bring my time back to God what you bring to God is your hope God heals my badge as I believe I have a right to everything we cross in your word Lord I'm trying to [Applause] all the states in our life and in our marriage and not bad members of all that sacred room whereas but God knows if we present our cookie in Augustine it's our favorite City then if you bring it back I don't care what's in front of you if it stands if it's cancer if it's ice pneumonia whatever it is it don't matter it cannot overcome your token right but yet he did not reject at all did of what God Said but God don't want nothing away [Applause] because the church lay out in all the Bible it's been interpreted and it's been handled down you know the Latin ballgame and then come down to weightlifting [Music] [Applause] amen as he goes on and he says because you rejected the word God has rejected you from being King but I want you to think about this now every hour God did not displace him right then he went Long Beach he went off and it was a crown he was on wiring the road he went on in the position of the throne and had blessing after blessing after blessed thank you oh okay I'm not surprised I'll tell you what y'all do go back and get my other iPad for me because it's been one of them Wednesdays I've had the office day that ever was I'm not surprised at all slew foot's trying to show up but devil I'm warning you now you better get out of here you better get out of here devil because we're going to have church [Applause] sorry y'all missed however long you missed there they said it wasn't working on the internet where was I oh yeah here we go actually when God said you heard and has rejected you but it's sort of like it was in the Garden of Eden when God told Adam and the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die but did he did Adam physically die that day no as a matter of fact you lived to be 930 years old was song displaced that day no you see that's what is so deceiving for people sometimes when they go to getting into sin and they go to doing this and that and the other and God doesn't immediately just Smite him down and you know give them a flu and give them covet on top of that and then pneumonia on top of that that'd scare the liver out of most of us but we can do a little wrong and then a little more wrong and then a little more wrong when we go to church and we're still blessed and we still feel the presence of the Lord and everything seems to be really good don't you see what that does to us that convinces us that we're all right so you see the blessing of God was not taken but it started that very day that God was going to replace him I myself don't want to walk as close as I can to sin I want to walk as far away as I can from it I don't want to look back and realize Lord have mercy I miss God five years ago and it just now caught up with me you understand what I'm saying so here he says God has rejected you from being King now turn with me if you would in the Book of Matthew and watch the Lord Jesus as he picks up along this same line watch how gifts can be actually genuine gifts that can be given to people whose nature and whose soul will never be born again and yet have genuine gifts from God and just as true as a saint of God's gift is true Matthew 7 21 not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that do us the okay so it's not everybody then that says Jesus Is My Lord he is my savior he is my redeemer I know this this is not debatable because this is the Lord Jesus himself saying it so it's not those that say that it's them that actually do his will but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven so a person can actually call him Lord and Savior and Redeemer and King and so on and so on and not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven oh my goodness well who will those that do the will of his father now notice in verse 22 many will say to me in that day Lord Lord now I want you to notice what's happened to these people they have lived their life and they died as Mortals somehow another when they went into that holding place in another dimension their soul still never gained the Consciousness that they were lost death does not change you so when they died they felt like they were real Christians and they were preachers or you know whatever they were missionaries Sunday school teachers and so on and whenever they died now remember some people brother random told us of several that whenever there's laying on the death's bed and their soul come back to them and then they go to screaming oh I'm lost I'm lost but that don't happen to everybody you see there are many many people that when they die they still are in that deceived state of darkness and their soul does not come to the consciousness of light so when the Resurrection comes they will actually raise from the dead they will stand before the Lord God in the body they sinned in which their garments testifies against them so they will walk up before him now they still have the exact same testimony that they did when they died so they didn't say oh Lord I'm lost I'm lost I'm lost you see all of those when their soul comes back before they die when they stand before God they will not stand there and say this they will stand and say oh God be merciful oh God be merciful because the consciousness of their nature they had it before they left but some actually die in deceit they actually die and their soul lord god of Mercy their soul is actually sealed with this deceit and they will raise from the dead thinking they're going into heaven think of it they will walk up before the Throne of God with no fear they will walk up praise God hallelujah oh thank you Lord I I know he's going to say you've done this and you was a missionary for 50 years and and you bought the widowsome colon you've done this and that and the other and they will walk up there still with that Darkness on their soul and they'll walk right up and say Lord Lord I'm here you remember me don't you I had campaigns I preached I preached the ten thousand at a time I preached a 5 000 at a time I've done this that the other so they tell what they've done and they're saying what they really believe why they're deceived lost deceived standing before almighty God deceived you may think you ain't got much to praise him for tonight but you got a whole lot to praise him for aren't you glad he won't let you lie and get by with him aren't you glad he won't let you live and do wrong you know just get by with aren't you glad when you do something wrong or say something wrong there's something that just smites your heart I'll tell you we ought to be just about dancing all over this place here tonight you ought to be so grateful to God he won't let you do wrong and get by with it oh how many still get submitted in your heart when you do something wrong you ought to be a happy person now notice this setting many not a few many will say to me in that day Lord Lord notice they're not asking for mercy they don't think they need it Lord Lord have we not prophesied you're talking about a powerful word speak for us by divine inspiration to predict to utter Force declare a saying which can only be known by divine revelation to act as a prophet discharge the prophetic office now these people lying they're not the Lord Jesus says and say you're a lie you've never done it he does not question their credibility that they did it so they would actually stand there and make a prophecy thus saith the Lord this and this and this is going to happen and people say Lord have mercy that happened did you hear that oh my goodness oh that has to be a man of God be careful men of God aren't just known by prophecy or signs they're known by doing the will of God notice how Jesus separates Supernatural gifts from doing the will of God many will say to me on that day Lord Lord have not prophesied in thy name and in thy name so it makes you wonder these folks must have not been just trinitarians now I was a trinitarian okay you know how I used to pray for the sick years ago in the name of father son Holy Ghost my first water baptism was an adultery baptism that's what the prophet calls it titles don't sit there and look at me bug eyed mostly always baptized in adultery too we didn't have no name we had titles so apparently these people knew the power of the name notice in the response I don't say well I I laid hands on the sick in the name of the father in the name of the son the name of Holy Ghost no these folks said we did this in your name they understand a little bit about the godhead didn't they in thy name had cast out devils wow cast out devils and in thy name done many men into fall so here are lost preachers lost laity who knows what all this covers standing there just as Hell Bound as they can be and they are testifying of the glory of God they're telling God what they've done in life Lord I've done this I I'll tell you one thank God I've done that I've done something else and you imagine them standing there and they're expecting such great words from the Lord God now notice Jesus uses the word many so it wasn't like this happened one time in the this individual life and that was it no repeatedly oh my goodness may God help us do you understand there will be a preacher that will walk up there all of you know him you've read about him in the Bible his name is Judas a preacher that could stand there and have some testimonies Beyond some message preachers he was sent out in Matthew 10 to cast out devils in an amazing add power to cast him out but didn't have inward power to keep him from taking him over I ask you which one's the Most Blessed a person that can cast him out and still become possessed by him or a housewife or a young boy or a young girl that has an inward power in them and demons cannot take them over oh Hallelujah why because they have the token applied and Satan cannot get inside that Tabernacle Judas will be able to say some of these very things I cast out Devils I heal the sick I preach the message I told people about you Jesus I was one of the first ones as a matter of fact to preach about you my Ministry is not inferior to Peter my Ministry of is not inferior to John or any of the rest of them I had an equivalent Ministry and they questioned themself before they questioned me I was that close you call me to preach Jesus personally it wasn't your mama it wasn't your daddy I didn't go by fleece hearing a fleece there but you call me yourself amen mama thank other children he had power to heal the sick the Bible to do all these great things but you see the Great era that Jesus is setting forth in these people their error is to not do his will because somehow the focus they thought well if I do this and this and this all these other things I don't do God will Overlook that now notice the words of Jesus in verse 23. then will I profess unto them I never knew you now this is not knowledge of knowing their name he's not saying I never knew you existed this is the Greek word that was used to line up actually with the equivalent Hebrew word in the Old Testament that when a man would know his wife Jesus knew who they were he knew their name but what he's saying is I never had a relationship with you you never received my seed in your soul I imagine Demas or walk up there remember he was a Spirit-filled man we looked at it Sunday led to Christ by Paul yeah but yet there's such a difference in being able to do signs and wonders and even good works than a desire to obey now notice Jesus goes on to say I never knew you you was never my bride I never took you unto myself and overshadowed you and sowed my seed in you I never knew you now listen to these words can you imagine friend oh God I hope none of us sitting here tonight ever hear these words oh nobody under the sound of my voice ever hears these words depart from me now you know if we are going to set at the table the marriage supper and we are going to still cry until he wipes that out of our eyes I wonder brother Nathan how are these people going to react because when they get in the regions of the Lost there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth I wonder what kind of emotion and what kind of display that they will show Lord God I I I just can't imagine what they will be sinking they unload their self and they tell Jesus what they've done and then Jesus will say these words unto them I never even knew you what no look there's something wrong here that that just can't be right I preached I I I was in Africa on the mission field I I've done this and that and the other I never knew you I moved down your heart when you was 20 years old about taking my name in baptism but I remember it as plain as day sitting there in that tent in the coast of Africa and you said if I do that I'll lose my position I can't do that the church will throw me out that was me dealing with you and you turned me down for a clerical position you turned me down to be a missionary with a denominational system so this is the words I say to you depart listen how he frames this ye that work iniquity now you do understand of course there's a difference in you falling short of the glory of God me falling short of the glory of God right we all have mistakes anybody had to repent of anything since Sunday okay I'll say the rest is going for a Pimp right now go ahead and do it right now and I'll go in with the service center but that's that's what Jesus said of these people notice the word that he uses here when he says depart from me ye that work iniquity look at this word it's Minister about labor for so you trade by so this become their business don't you understand that's what a lot of religion is it's just a business and may I say it's a filthy one because it conveys to people they can live any way they want to they can do whatever they want to don't you understand all of these television preachers and a lot of these led us seeing preachers they ain't nothing they ain't nothing in the world but a bunch of trafficking iniquity preachers and what are they selling what are they doing they're selling iniquity by telling their people oh it don't mean no difference if you wear makeup it don't make why God don't care it don't make no difference them bunch of holy rollers and that then people doubt that skirt Church all well that's just a bunch of craziness but well if it is what if our sisters lost by dressing Godly what if you lost if you don't I told somebody not long ago I said yeah we're the skirt Church in so much even our piano was one our keyboard wears one and our organ did wear one so we built another case for it let them laugh let them ridicule let them make fun but one day they will stand there before almighty God and God will say you sold iniquity you perfect inequity you understand what a lot of these churches are doing they are trafficking iniquities their business they traffic damnation hold on a minister about labor for labor for trade by to make gains by trading well of course they do gain more members ha ha oh yeah sure that's what a lot of folks want they may take some friends that's not just how you're in the domination either a lot of folks in the message are looking for preachers that'll rub them on the head oh don't get down where I live you know just kind of just kind of you know just don't remember and whether or not you know it more and more and more there are more message churches that don't want to hear the message preached they don't mind you're saying oh yeah God sent a prophet but they just don't want you to stand up telling what he said they don't want you accordingly said what do they want to hear the same Bible stories they hold heard when they was a Methodist and they don't want the prophet mentioned they don't want the word mentioned they don't want the Seven Seals they don't want the message why because Satan knows that's where rapturing Faith lays in the end time message of the last day oh my brother sister the Pentecostals preached the Bible stories the methodists preach the Bible story it did not produce a Rapture then it won't produce one now we've got to have a message of the last days a message of the end time it ain't enough to say oh yeah I believe God sent a prophet tell me what he said [Applause] oh but now you realize a real gift from God to a real son of God and actually be misused this is where it gets really tricky and dangerous somewhat people want gifts and they ask for them and pray for them and many promoted in that sense but they're such a responsibility that comes with it now I figure in the next little bit amens will be like hens teeth and some of it's going to get quiet even though I'm going to read to you what your Prophet said I'll see if you believe it or not the word became flesh 1954. I believe that I have misused a Great Divine gift of a prophetic gift used in a way of Divine Healing I don't think that it's encouraged God or cause God to think so much of me in doing so and somebody said y'all okay with that really okay okay I'll go on I was going through it anyway but it's just nice when y'all go along with it now you see if you were looking for a perfect preacher man alive I hate to tell you you're wasting your time there are no perfect singers perfect musicians and they show ain't no perfect laity and there ain't no perfect preachers there ain't no perfect prophets there's never been a perfect Apostle there's never been a perfect Pastor there's never been a perfect missionary [Music] but you see people sometimes depending on what they do with god-given gifts now brother random there's no question about it I mean God used a man in a way that has never been used before and never will again as a matter of fact as he said if anything anything greater Rises they're higher better than this greater than this I am a false prophet and there will never raise anything greater than that but notice him now as he starts using this this gift now this is notice the years 1954 and he says that he believed that he had misused a Great Divine gift now was he using it for money you know better than that no was he using it for women no he was using it to help the people because he loved the people so you see if Satan can't get you one way he'll try to trip you up in another way and use your desire to say be genuine oh I just want to help the people I just want to help them that's exactly what brother Branham wanted to do he wanted to help the people now notice this in wine Bloomington this is 1961 a few years apart you see I'm trying to use a prophetic gift in an Evangelistic service that's the reason it don't work so well it doesn't African it does anywhere else but the United States anywhere else but here it'll work now actually what happened was in the United States and some parts of the world but in the United States this gift become a form of entertainment and you can watch the people in the prayer lines brother random would call them out and tell them this and this one and then if he would stop listen discernment and just start laying hands on the people and you can hear it in the prayer line the response of the people goes down the people quit shouting and quit hollering and praising the Lord and he'd say now he's still here he's still here and he said look here look here this woman here your name is so and so you've been so and so and then watch the people listen at them they'll go to riling again writing again their faiths will get up now what's happening they are looking at the sign instead of the commission praise the Lord now notice this as I was with Moses if you haven't heard this in a while doing good to listen at it it's a turning place in brother Brandon's Ministry September the 11th 1960. no matter what goes on how much I fall fail rather I fail miserably I should have never went ahead with them signs now listen what his confession is that wasn't the will of God I should have never went ahead of them signs that wasn't the will of God so here now we don't have a God that's Matthew 7. we don't have a man that's going to stand before God and he'll say well Lord I cast out Devils out on this and God say to him well depart from me no we're talking about a real prophet of God that loved the Lord and had a greater gift than my goodness in my opinion next to the Lord Jesus himself as a matter of fact the prophet said the Lord Jesus had more success in his ministry than he did his own when he was on the earth boy that's a hard to swallow in it but it's a truce when you look at it in reality but yet we're still looking at a Son of God and you said you know people say oh my goodness well you know what if somebody makes a mistake with a gift then we don't want them at all no we want real ones we want genuine ones but we've got to understand what God gives you that it's going to depend on what you do with it and then you will be held accountable for the way you administer that gift now notice this I should have never went ahead of them signs it wasn't the will of God but God's blessed it anyhow okay so something can be out of the will of God and God bless it anyhow but apparently God's got tired of it because his Prophet is changing some things here now notice he said but I'm ready to leave this mountain I want to go across Jordan I want to carry the commission now listen what the commission was from the angel of the Lord get the people to believe you get the people to believe you and when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer even cancer but it got to where if people didn't hear their name and their address and this and that and the other the commission didn't mean too much now listen carefully you say why are you saying this because I'm afraid our message ranks is hidden in the same direction that if somebody don't tell you something a certain evangelist travels around the world wanted to talk with me some time ago and he was at a certain place preaching and I had a prayer line after his preaching and a sister come up and told him whatever it was she wanted young sister so the brother prayed for go sister believe it so she stands there stops stands there looks at him did the Lord show you anything she says he said no did the Lord tell you anything no now you see if we're not careful we will so major on such things that it'll come to pass that people will not think they can get healed unless somebody is Discerning them or they feel something or they pass out or they fall out hey I believe in all of that but Jesus didn't say none of that when he sent his force in mark 16. come on now [Applause] I've been hearing more and more of it that people they come up in a prayer line and if you don't tell them well the Lord shows me this or the Lord says that or the Lord says that then they they can't believe don't you see what's happening we're coming to the same spot if we're not careful that brother Branham was himself so what was it that led it to this spot maybe I should go in the office and finish this sermon it might be safer for me you know what led it to this brother Branham not trying to be selfish not trying to be arrogant and proud because he loved God's people and wanted to help them so much that he took something that he shouldn't have and used it in an improper way because he saw it helped the people's weak faith amen praise the Lord now notice what he says all the Pentecostal people like Signs they like to see it the Bible said of wicked and adultery generation seeks out your sign but the commission was pray for the sick and tens of thousands times thousands that I have failed to pray for because they all desired the sign y'all doing good don't nobody jump up and run out so maybe it's nervous right now he says you got it in high gear ain't you that's okay just sit still you're doing good oh you see this is a reason that I can follow this man show me where some of these other TV guys will stand up and tell you there's mistakes tell me where some of the best is pastors well they'll preach on yours Ain't It Funny and never hear none of theirs come on now saying so sit down and look at me that way but this man was honest before God and honest before us so when I hear these people say he was a deceiver and he tried to do this and the other thing you're a bunch of idiots you apparently don't listen to very many tapes at all because he tells on himself more than to believe the sign ever told on him well Hallelujah come on now why because he's following God's pattern of the Bible That's the Way God's Bible did it told on Moses it told on David it told on Jeremiah he tells on us and brother random told on himself that's a real servant of God [Applause] now notice this honesty but the commission was pray for the sick and tens of thousands times thousands that I have failed to pray for because they all desired the son they all desire it now we won't ask for a show of hands tonight of how many in our building tonight if we was having a prayer line and brother Branham was here and that gift was there how many of us would want the same thing or could we walk through the prayer line and say servant of God you don't have to see no vision for me if you'll pray God will do it I believe it or you could stand when I turn and say you don't have to lay hands on me just look at me let me get in your shadow Hallelujah just say the word say it I walk off your well or would you want your name told I could understand if you were sick I could understand if you don't know what world you're in that somebody might need to tell you your name you've noticed since she was knee-high to a jackrabbit why in the world do you want somebody to tell you your name now well you want somebody to tell you what you had for breakfast you went to the doctor think that makes you more spiritual then more spiritual do you know God's Prophet said the greatest honor that you and I can pay to God is believe his word believe that's the greatest honor you could give the work of God a hundred million dollars that's not the greatest honor the greatest honor you can ever pay to God is take God at his word and say Lord I believe Lord I believe oh brother Tony he's going to stop having prayer lines no I am not but I want us to have them also know it it's a man of God passes out before you get to him you can say well glory to God I got close enough to then only I still believe I'll be well and the deacons laid hands on me but the Bible said they shall and I believe I'm going to get well in your world nobody discern me well shoot nobody saw no light over me or know this or that or the other over me have you got a word for me I do I've got a word for everybody here tonight that said by his stripes you are already healed I've got a word for you glory to God they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name they will cast out devil I got a word for you I've got a word from almighty God he cannot lie watch this in paragraph 163 the other day I was trying to work the ministry and I got it into the room and a man come on the platform and said now brother Branham wait a minute my case it's different I just got to know something I said well the doctor can examine oh no I don't want that I want to know right now my case is so different I said well I hate to do this brother went on into it the first thing you know the Holy Spirit he said praise the Lord I tried I said the rest you all come now let me pray for you well when I did that you know the next one and said my case is just as important as his then I got about six or eight close the meeting like to kill me now listen to these words I always wondered why that would do that to me it's because I was doing it wrong that's just a signpost pointing to the commission it's not the commission but I want to go across Oh Glory I'm going to go on across Jordan I want to get into that something y'all know where my faith let's let him talk about it yourself brother Brandon wanted something to happen to him you can see why he would have depended on them Visions you ought to send them Visions was the word of the Lord it was infallible it was infallible remember him tell him about the man that fell and all these tons of pressure building fell on the man and crushed his liver and my many many things then things even going to live and brother him said I told my wife oh if Jesus was here maybe he'd walk down there in that hospital he'd lay his holy hands on him and he said that boy be made well he said that boy stood with me you know and told some different things and he said oh but I'm a sinner oh but if God would show me a vision and he said then I told her well if God did show me a vision and I went down there it'd still be these same old sinful hands so he said I walked in there without a vision and laid hands on him he was in service that night of the next night one they didn't expect him to live don't you see if a brother of Adam it would have been so easy for him to depend on that oh there's nothing wrong with his hands there's nothing wrong with emotion unless unless we have to have them to believe we're healed [Applause] oh he says for my faith will rise to a spot that when I pray for the people he's being honest and son I want my face that I just pray for him remember him saying that if God showed him that George Washington was raised going to raise from the dead he'd invite the world to come and see him and say get him a chair and let him sit down and rest a while isn't it amazing though he didn't do that without a vision now the word says there'll be a resurrection I hope George Washington will be there and be part of it but brother bam didn't know that for sure that George Washington would so he couldn't call him out of that you can see for us it's hard to imagine we don't live in that realm of it and oh yeah I've seen Visions before myself but I've never lived in that realm that God's Prophet lived in it was so absolutely perfect he would challenge the whole world on it oh my God now notice he said I've leaned heavy on the signpost myself Lord you show me about this for I pray for him because I don't know what I might do listen to this response how cruel wow how cruel that was what if it was cruel then I ask you want to be cruel again if we do the same thing oh my god listen to this I asked the congregation okay TD Jakes I'm waiting bro all the rest of you how about you smiling guy down in Texas I'm really waiting on you man notice I didn't call him bro I just said May I like to stand and hear them give an honest sincere apology I've been wrong I've LED you wrong there are this caliber of man oh my I asked the congregation to forgive me the congregations of the world that's listening in on this tape forgive me I was wrong I should have never carried it out like that that wasn't his commission at the first place that was a sign pointing to the commission I should have prayed for the sick everywhere I would stand sometime and run 50 or 75 maybe 40 or 50 discernments at one time each and every night is that right Gene Leo you're here somewhere that's in the meeting said sure that was the truth and what did it do when it left me and started home I'd forget where I was at want to know where I'd come from on the highway you mean to tell me God does that to a man no sir it was a man doing it to himself by taking a signpost instead of a commission so our commission is what mark 16. the prophet identifies it and says the first commission to the church was Matthew 10. heal the sick cleanse the leper raise the Dead then he reaffirms it again to the church in Mark 16. isn't it amazing as much as we believe in shouting and anybody tells you I don't believe in shouting you tell them they're a liar I do believe in Shout but Jesus didn't say these signs shall follow them that believe they shall shout they will but he knew everybody wouldn't aren't you glad he didn't say that's a sign you none shouters you'd be in a hurry heap of trouble wouldn't you do we believe visions do we believe in spiritual dreams so we believe in all that but was them words in the in the commission of Mark 16. wonder why Jesus didn't say that because he knew they would only be very few that would ever see Vision so the commission could only be you know way back under 300 years ago and then maybe there'd be another down there every 400 years or 500 years that would see a vision but he made the commission to where seeing a vision or not seeing a vision shouter not a shouter jumper not a jumper you could still obey the commission of the word of God these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues and the church said do we believe in these other things with all of our hearts but that's not the commission can y'all handle a little bit more a few more minutes now let me just say this and I'll get you up real sensed up real tight and then I'll read to you you do realize that in the the manifestation of the pulls of the prophet's Ministry that whenever he started explaining to the other preachers and so on actually brother Branham was the cause of the impersonations now I'll read it to you then you can say Amen now watch this so that's what he told me the other night said you caused a lot of carnal impersonations to rise who did now can you imagine an angel of God standing before you he crossed his arms I'll read it to you in a minute sit down with these arms crossed looking at him my brother Branham says what he says when you hear it it's like he's saying it with a Stern voice now again a lot of preachers ain't going to say this about Angelic visitations that he got all over me and rebuked me and done this and that and other you ever heard him preachers talk about that I wonder why let's tell the whole truth what do you say Now look for him whenever I gave my heart to God I I was I was in all the way when I come to the message then and now for 40 years by the grace of God I was in it all the way I'm still in it all the way so I am not forbidden from Reading quotes like this or preaching them oh brother Donny it'll hurt people it'll only hurt those that don't understand the truth you see if you're trying to make an idolater brother Brandon boy you can't take these kind of quotes but if you're wanting the truth you'll say thank you Lord for a man that told us the truth thank you for a prophet that would be honest now notice the angel telling him you caused a lot of carnal impersonations to rise and he said no don't let no one ever see this remember he said that third pull was not a public show I just sent this one who had been talking now this is from what is a vision in Chicago behind me stepped around in front of me it was him the angel of the Lord and he had his hands folded he looked at me and said just what I told you not to do I said yes that's right he said you see that first promise when you used to put your hand on the people and tell them what their trouble said the second poll was when you'd know the secret of the heart like I told you and said instead of you keeping that to yourself you tried to explain all about it and tell the people and when you did you didn't know nothing about it yourself is it just Mayors are getting hot in here now I'm gonna tell you one thing evangelic visitations don't correct other men around this message I have to question the angel I don't figure there's none of us ever walked where he did or ever will and if he needed correction how much do we need it oh my goodness I heard a vision of a man years ago said it was a vision he was caught up in a vision and caught up into heaven itself supposed to be a preacher of this message and whatever he walked into heaven Paul come and got him and Paul set him down in a chair in him and Paul sat there and started having a conversation and Paul started telling him how hard it was in life how tough his burden was how about God's sake as a dog said I said who in the world is this Feller think he is Paul you think Paul beyond the curtain of time is setting up her talking about the troubles he'd had down here in life he went through this big long rolled out deal I thought Bud who who told you that you was the main man because they sure lied to you you need to find who they are Paul told him this and Paul told him that oh brother he said Paul said I know brother you'll understand I can't share this with nobody up here can you imagine a person in a sea off of the body talking to a blown up stuffed shirt that don't even know the first letter of humility and Paul talking to him about some come on somebody let's wake up and realize Heaven is not full of arrogance and pride and selfishness it's going to be full of people that died to that stuff good Lord if y'all see me standing on the side of the road tomorrow we'll work for food won't anybody stop by me a hamburger you will all right thank you he said you don't know nothing about it yourself and you caused a bunch of incarnal and impersonations to rise up and you see what you've done you see friends how dangerous it is when we have God's gifts if we don't use them the right way well I believe in the move of God yes but all my heart I just don't want to see it go back this way that if you don't have a word for somebody if you don't say a vision for somebody they don't get nothing I believe in all of that but all of that is on as credible as the man who's telling you amen amen I know beyond a shadow of a doubt I can trust his word [Music] there's been all kinds of folks that's had dreams about Erica different ones have seen Visions about this and I thank God for every one of them but let me tell you where my faith is anchored in tonight God's written word God's written word Hallelujah by the way if I don't feel it and if she has good days and bad days if you have good days and bad days that don't change a thing if you've got your Revelation in the written word then you may not be able to get a hold of the sister that had a dream about you or a man that had a vision about you but brother as long as you've got an iPhone or a Droid you can be able to have that promise right there and read it to the devil every day by his stripes I am healed read it to him greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world yes thank God for the emotion thank God for shouting but the absolute is the word of God the absolute is the word of God gifts can be wrong God's word can never [Applause] well praise the Lord I guess I'll be the subject of some sermons for the next month or so but that's okay read with me Mark chapter 16 verse 15. and he said unto them go into all the world and push play what this is the commission from the man himself and if he felt like and knew that preaching would work up to so far and then at the last ages and I answer that y'all don't need to preach no more push play and obey but if you push play and Obey you'll have preachers in your church because that's what the types will tell you so it shows me that person played but they ain't no van or they'd have a pastor that preaches the word of God well Glory I know some of you wish I come with a remote some of y'all speed me up some of you back Pittman some of you jumped me from one thing to the other I'm so glad I didn't come with only one remote handheld by God himself [Applause] I see why folks don't want no preachers they can pick what they want to hear when they listen to a tape and they can start it here and stop it here and start to hear and stop it here that's why they don't want their High burn up living like a bunch of Jezebels and a worldly system brother I'll tell you we need some men of God in the Pulpit that'll preach the old-fashioned Holy Ghost Gospel that'll introduce Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that'll heal the sick that'll clean up our lives [Applause] and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these Sons shall follow them that belief and my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents which is not serpent handling churches these examples were displayed in the book of Acts and there weren't any serpent handling churches there was a preacher one time that's built in a fire and a snake showed up in the wrong woodpile he sizzled to his death he went ahead and grabbed a hold of that old thing and the devil thought boy I've got him now I'll take that old preacher out but actually it was a serpent that God took out because Paul shook him off in the fire that's what we want to do this is the Fulfillment of Mark 16 that old lust thing grabs a hold of you shake it off in the fire pornography grabs a hold to you sickness grabs a hold to you cancer grabs a hold to you hang it over the fire and say go on back to hell you devil go on back to hell where you come from let go of me you devil you ain't got no right to hold me now he'll stop shall I'm Healed by his blood I redeemed I'm set free Hallelujah if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay they shall lay hands on the sick the prophet said it didn't even say you had to pray remember brother random talking about him doing an x-ray on the preachers on certain ones and when they take their hand out and put it on people's head it looked like fire lightning light coming out of their hands it wasn't every one of them they said just certain ones I've had a few of them lighting and bold preachers lay hands on me before you understand can you imagine the phenomenal of the supernatural God now look for it the Lord Jesus could have said their law see Visions they will all shout they will all jump that's that does not not the commission just for not careful we will insert things and our Focus will be oh just so give me a word brother give me a word I'm not making light of that but that's not the commission we're gonna look back if the Lord changed in a few years and say what happened to us now we're having prayer lines and people won't even they won't even believe unless you see something for them I got one more quote and I'm going over a little bit but I'm going to read it for you let's jump over just one Brothers to try and go to do God of service many times a man God can deal with them and give them a gift and the people will squeeze in on those people and if they're not perfectly called and sin of God he'll cause that man or that woman to say something that isn't his will because the people constrains them to do it how I had to catch our own little Pastor on it out here in the woods one morning about three o'clock in the morning said go tell brother Neville I come to you didn't I brother Neville everybody brother Neville prophesy over me tell me this or that you see you would have him saying things that wouldn't come to pass praise the Lord amen so you see with everything that God gives us we still have to use it in the right way how many once just use whatever God's gave you want to be sensible and responsible and you're singers your musicians well whatever it is that God's given you to the body remember a lot of it will depend on you how you use it what a blessing it will be and it may not even necessarily be the way you want it I've said it to you before and I'll say it again tonight and God is my witness if it was left up to me we would stop our internet tonight I would never stream it again I get shot at hate criticize ridicule people want to cut my head off and everything else and that's the message people much less the sinners but you know why I do it because I get a little later and I'll get some after this some of them right now is chomping their fingernails off today no dear God don't let him do it I do it because people here and there and everywhere some no church to go to so it ain't for me it ain't even necessarily for you your gift it may pull you as these deacons sometimes if everything about their position it's good and smooth and lovely no songwriters musicians but that's what a gift is given for not for you for others the sparrow hits together praise the Lord praise the Lord with all of our heads about here tonight I wonder maybe some of you are not even sure what you have what God's given to your charge your care maybe you're still really trying to sort through it all and just Lord what do you want me to do what am I called to do well if you're there tonight I believe that he can help you to be able to know what his will is for your life maybe some of you you're convinced at least for the present right now well I'm supposed to this and this and this maybe some of you have been in that for years and years but I dare say every one of us no matter what category brand of the three that I described I sure every one of us could say Lord we need your help I've been in my vocation of what God called me to be for decades of my life but I still need his help because I don't want to mess up he's given me different gifts in my life what will I do with them well I take them and pull them toward me me me me me God show me God told me God told me God showed me God shall make God told me if I'm the only person on the earth that God is talking to you folks should question it since we're in a body move donning just talking to one man or two men or three men God's name with his bride around the world how many of you'd like to be remembered tonight I would would you pray for me Heavenly Father I know it's it's been strange really last several Services have been so somber so serious so checkup time I guess would say Lord I Thank you for it because I believe it's in the right seasons I pray Lord begin with me tonight help me Lord God what little you've given me help me that I'll always be responsible with it Lord that I'll never abuse it I'll never use it wrong I'll never turn it toward me or this our church but it'll always be turned towards you and what can bring you glory Lord we we don't need no glory we deserve none Lord forever man woman boy girl that's your present those that have streamed the service would you help each of us some of them may never prophesy they may never speak in tongues I may never be the emotional type that'll run up and down the hallways of the church and scream and be really loud and we thank God for that I I love to see Sons and Daughters of God dancing and worshiping God in the spirit I love to see it but yet I know all of them won't do that because that was not in the commission so what if the commission was what will be in the body every body it will be there every assembly that's where you want it you could have included many of these other things but you chose the ones you wanted so then you add other things we thank you for people who can have dreams and they come with no symbols which a prophet told us without a prophet in the land to interpret it a Dream from God will not have a bunch of symbols so it'll not be three stars hanging over three goats and fourteen cows over in the left and 32 trees on the right and then we come out there and say well I think it meant this or that or the other well according to the message of the hour unless they're a prophet they ain't got no right to interpret that yet Lord we know people want to be so spiritual so they will have a dream and have all kinds of symbols in it and they go to interpret it and I'm thinking my goodness I guess we just think it don't matter we want to be so spiritual because somehow we think those things make us more spiritual than obeying the word Lord help us help us to realize how you love obedience how you love obedience well father I pray from now until the Rapture comes least lies in our assembly others can do whatever they want every church is sovereign I pray for every time that we come up for prayer for every individual whether it's individually or we have a prayer line or whatever that my church does not think that I have to see a vision over them or have a have a word as that would be said but that I can lay my hands on them and they've got confidence and they'll walk away and say by the Lord Jesus Stripes I am healed then if you give a vision to somebody or a dream to somebody praise God will accept that as long as it's right as long as it's true but our greatest honor that we can give to you is believe your word help us I pray Lord God in the name of Jesus may we be able to leave this place tonight and Ponder I know they will they're going to think about it and they're going to be talking about it and no doubt people will be talking about it on the internet oh my goodness you're what Brother Don he's preaching oh what in the world is he getting is he doing away with this Supernatural Lord you know better than that anybody knows me knows I'm not I just don't want us to get to the same spot that brother Branham got to and he missed praying for thousands of people thousands of people miss their healing because other people there had to have a son and it wore him out so much that the people couldn't even get prayed for but thank you for his honesty Lord oh praise the Lord anybody in here tonight want to just say Lord I want to take you at your word I want to be the kind of Christian that I can take you at your word I won't have to have to ask the preacher did you see anything you got a word for me would you feel anything uh well you got you got something special well if the preacher says yeah by his stripes you are healed brother praise be to God help us Lord to give you the highest honor we can give we can take you at your words oh we worship you tonight Jesus we bless you father Lord I'm not trying to chide them I have walked in these shoes before Lord the reason I can tell them these things because being a former Pentecostal I know how I was oh how I depended on signs how I would seek after those I told them not long ago of some instances in my life I know what it can lead you to and you had to let me fall flat on my face to break me away from it and Lord it breaks my heart when I see some of the message people going in the same way that I was in when I was a Pentecostal and yet a lot of the message people have never been in Pentecost so they really don't have a clue what it's all about and here I am Manhattan to others of us that's been in there and we see some of the same stuff coming around again not a repeat of the original Acts 2. but a repeat of Azusa Street we don't want that Lord we don't see what that messed up we want the original the original Hallelujah Lord God your Prophet said the American people had to be entertained I hope they can understand that's what they wanted him to do with the gift entertain them I pray our church does not turn into that type of a church that we have to be spiritually entertained but Lord God may we as your people be able to ask for prayer and walk away from there if we don't feel anything it means absolutely nothing if we didn't have a sensation if the preacher didn't see a vision over us or or give us a direct word from God we walk away from there and we believe and in a few days or a month or however long it happens because we take you at your words granted Lord God would you lay your hands on one another tonight now if you notice when Jesus sends his commission he doesn't even say that it was just limited to preachers only Carol got a testimony just this week from from one of the sisters and had a baby that was suffered was no preacher around so this sister just laid her hands on her baby herself and ask God to move well you I guess you know the rest of the story God moved why because Jesus said they shall lay their hands on the sickness and they shall recover no doubt no doubt there's sicknesses and diseases and troubles and heartaches and all kinds of things in this place tonight how many all believers with me we want to believe for our brothers and sisters right now praise God brother Daryl maybe you can come but him and pray for the people Hallelujah Hallelujah if you feel it that's wonderful but it's still wonderful if you don't because you're taking God at his word and if you walk out here and say well everybody around me shouted but I didn't feel one thing don't base it on that pay God the highest honor you can pay him you believe his word just believe almighty God we bow in your wonderful presence this evening Lord you believe in the promises of your word to be true Dear God for Lord heavens and earth will pass away at your word shall never fail Lord and in obedience to your word tonight we lay our hands upon one another father God into the commission that's been given to us Lord and I've seen you do so many wonderful things when the saints of God would take you at your word Lord and call on your name on behalf of the brother and their sister Lord to see him delivered God of afflictions to seal delivered dear God of depression and oppression and diabetes Lord and arthritis and cataracts and glaucoma and oh God there's nothing too great for you tonight father so Lord I pray May the holy spirit that wrote the word dear God may it come and confirm it tonight I pray As We Lay hands upon one another May the weak be made strong father God May the sick be made well oh God May the depressed be lifted up in Joy dear God and may every promise of your word become the past in the lives of your people tonight father for Lord the same word that said we shall lay hands upon the sick that same word said we shall take Rapture dear God and Father we believe that word to be true Lord and we're moving towards it now and obedience to your word father we curse the enemy that would come against us tonight in the name of Jesus Christ by that same minority that raised our Lord from the grave May that save anointing who gave my daughter back to me May that same Authority tonight move above the hearts of the people dear God and may the chains fall off May the change loose tonight from the people that we can go free for you said in your word whom the son has made free is free indeed Satan you're a defeated foe you have no hold on us I rebuke you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ leave these people for the glory of God As We Lay hands on one to the other to the other May the liberation of the Spirit come Lord and may we lift up the hands in Victory we are not a defeated people we are the Overcomers of this hour and every devil is under our feet oh God we can look tonight do our feet God see that every devil is under our feet Lord we are the army of God as Invincible Army and we will not be defeated through God when we Mark the Lord hallelujah in general the Holy Spirit and we're marching on Lord God tonight God I commit my brother and my sister into your hands For Your Glory May there come great testimonies dear God tonight because the saints of God in obedience to your word laid hands on one another father God I did Lord what you told us to do now the rest Lord is up to you father we lay our hands up on the sick and obedience Lord but you are the Healer dear God and we look to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ and the Saints said amen may it be so for the glory of God Hallelujah Hallelujah amen praise the Lord glory to God isn't he wonderful for him amen amen I was in a meeting not long ago it's going to have a prayer line but I did not feel to have the prayer line and I told the people I said lay hands on one another and they did oh there's all kinds of healings took place people healed of
