[10:26] [Music]
[10:38] bless you I'm so happy first to be
[10:40] together today once again in his
[10:43] presence and
[10:44] realizing that we're such a blessed
[10:46] people to be able to know what he has
[10:49] done what he's going to do but what he's
[10:52] doing
[10:53] I'm glad to be a part of the history of
[10:56] the church I'm glad to be a part of the
[10:58] future of the church
[11:00] but I'm so glad to be a part of what's
[11:02] going on right now
[11:05] I greet you today in the name of the
[11:06] Lord
[11:07] let's turn to second Samuel chapter
[11:10] 12 verse 24.
[11:18] I guess if I'd have preached faster and
[11:20] talked faster
[11:21] I probably could have been preaching on
[11:23] Mary today instead of Bathsheba
[11:27] either I'm a little late or you're all a
[11:29] little early I guess we just have to
[11:30] figure out
[11:32] um
[11:34] I had to get David redeemed though
[11:36] didn't what we had to we had to
[11:39] so today by the help of the Lord we'd
[11:41] like to
[11:43] look and look back at Bathsheba
[11:46] God blessed Bathsheba with a
[11:50] a son whose name was Solomon
[11:53] who would become king and his father's
[11:57] Stead
[11:58] I believe myself from looking at it that
[12:00] it must have been the will of God for
[12:03] David and Bathsheba to be together
[12:06] but like Satan does US many times
[12:09] he will jump ahead of the plan of God
[12:11] and try to mess it up
[12:15] I wonder myself if David would have
[12:18] waited
[12:19] it's very possible and likely
[12:22] that your eye would have been killed
[12:25] in the same battle that he died in
[12:28] except in the will of God
[12:32] must have been his time to go anyway
[12:35] but Satan tries to push us ahead of
[12:39] God's program
[12:41] and get us in trouble
[12:42] time has ever been there done that
[12:45] well the rest of you will before you
[12:46] leave no doubt
[12:49] and all of you can raise your hands
[12:52] let's read together II Samuel chapter 12
[12:54] verse 24.
[12:59] and David comforted
[13:03] Bathsheba
[13:05] his wife
[13:08] now she's not called
[13:10] the wife of Uriah
[13:13] but now she's legally married to David
[13:18] and David comforted Bathsheba yes why
[13:21] how different it was
[13:24] in the first introduction of Bathsheba
[13:27] David took her
[13:31] but now David is comforting her
[13:35] and went into her and lay with her in
[13:37] shibara's son
[13:39] and he called his name
[13:42] Solomon
[13:44] and the Lord
[13:45] loved him
[13:48] you don't find that very many times in
[13:51] the entire Bible
[13:53] when God isolated an individual and said
[13:56] that he loved him
[13:58] notice in verse 25.
[14:01] and he sent by the hand of Nathan the
[14:03] prophet
[14:04] and he called his name
[14:07] Jedediah
[14:09] now in the Hebrew it's yet idea
[14:16] which means beloved of Jehovah
[14:20] the name given to Solomon through Nathan
[14:24] the prophet so God renames him
[14:28] because he loves it Solomon's a good
[14:31] name it means peace so it's a good name
[14:33] but God is making a coin now after his
[14:37] birth that he is yeti DIA
[14:41] beloved
[14:42] of Jehovah
[14:45] I mean a lot to be remembered today as
[14:46] we pray
[14:48] and our church family we have several
[14:50] that are sick many different ones doing
[14:52] with side effects of being sick several
[14:55] that are traveling of course this week
[14:56] and gone to be with their families over
[14:59] the holidays so we certainly want to
[15:00] remember them I wonder how many of you
[15:02] would like to be remembered today just
[15:04] raise your hand to the Lord
[15:06] amen
[15:07] Heavenly Father
[15:10] we are so grateful to be gathered
[15:12] together here today again and
[15:15] we thank you Lord that we've been able
[15:17] to have this place
[15:19] if everything goes well maybe a few
[15:22] weeks out we'll be able to move into
[15:25] our new building but we're grateful for
[15:28] the Holiday Inn
[15:30] we're thankful I was really getting
[15:33] concerned about what we were going to do
[15:36] but just as you always do
[15:39] you always have something in your mind
[15:42] and we're grateful that you've worked it
[15:44] out for us
[15:45] this would have been terrible to have to
[15:47] stream this whole time
[15:49] but thank you Lord Jesus
[15:52] no now we've come today again that we
[15:54] could worship and sing and how beautiful
[15:57] the songs were as the Saints lifted
[16:00] their voices and adoration to you
[16:03] commemorating your first Advent
[16:07] at least in this way as a baby
[16:10] we want you to know we are so grateful
[16:13] that you come
[16:15] it's so sad what our world has turned
[16:18] Christmas into
[16:19] but to us Lord Jesus it's still about
[16:23] you
[16:24] it's not about turkey and dressing and
[16:27] eating and gifts and this and that and
[16:29] the other
[16:30] it's because you came
[16:33] and we thank you so much
[16:35] father you see the needs of your
[16:37] children many hands uplifted needed
[16:40] prayer today requests on their heart
[16:42] different ones that are traveling others
[16:44] will be traveling this week coming up
[16:46] different ones with the flu with covet
[16:48] with infections with this at the other
[16:51] Lord God be mindful of your sheep today
[16:53] I pray
[16:55] help us Lord help me to get out of the
[16:57] way father that you can speak through me
[17:00] words of life
[17:01] granted your God we commit the service
[17:03] to you now in Jesus name amen
[17:07] God bless you may be seated
[17:21] we have before us today
[17:24] a beautiful picture
[17:27] of God showing
[17:29] love
[17:30] forgiveness
[17:32] and ultimately
[17:34] Redemption
[17:36] God is going to take the pain
[17:39] of this woman by the name of Bathsheba
[17:43] and he's going to
[17:45] not necessarily eradicate all of it
[17:49] but change it around
[17:52] her first entrance into the palace
[17:56] was one of sin and lust
[18:00] the outcome is going to be terrible
[18:03] as we've looked at already nowhere does
[18:06] the Lord actually blame her
[18:08] and yet
[18:10] she was still called in wrong
[18:13] to defy the king would have been deaths
[18:16] according to the law the Torah
[18:19] a woman when she was forced upon by a
[18:22] man
[18:23] her innocence was declared by her
[18:27] screaming out
[18:29] so if she screamed out then that's
[18:32] basically all she could do
[18:34] but we have no record that Bathsheba did
[18:38] that or didn't do it
[18:40] but we know that
[18:42] God and His Mercy had made a covenant
[18:45] with David
[18:47] and that covenant could not be broken
[18:50] even though it would cause David lots of
[18:52] pain and sorrow
[18:54] Bathsheba I believe was part of that
[18:59] Covenant
[19:00] her introduction into the Covenant was
[19:03] certainly the wrong way
[19:05] but yet God has a way of redeeming
[19:08] things
[19:09] that we mess up
[19:12] after a royal summons which brings her
[19:16] into the presence of the king
[19:19] and defiles this what a wretched
[19:23] entrance into the life of King David
[19:27] the circumstances began to improve for a
[19:31] Bathsheba she's a woman of great pain
[19:34] loses her husband loses her first son
[19:37] and we know that according to the Jewish
[19:40] tradition that Uriah had children and so
[19:45] she was taken not only from her husband
[19:47] but taken from those children we can
[19:51] tell from the character of the woman
[19:53] that she was a loving person
[19:56] she was not a seductress she was not a
[19:59] temptress she was not at all a Delilah
[20:03] totally different than a Delilah
[20:08] and yet a woman who had been brought
[20:11] into circumstances beyond their choice
[20:14] and Beyond her will
[20:16] notice with me in First Kings chapter 2
[20:19] verse 19.
[20:21] Bathsheba therefore went into King
[20:24] Solomon to speak unto him for adonijah
[20:27] and the King rose up to meet her
[20:30] and bowed himself unto her
[20:35] and notice what happens now and sat down
[20:37] on his throne
[20:39] and caused a seat to be set for the
[20:43] King's mother
[20:45] and she sat on his right hand
[20:50] so the greatest King that we know of on
[20:53] the earth at this time when his mother
[20:55] comes in
[20:57] he rises off of his throne which must
[21:00] have been absolutely beautiful the way
[21:03] it's described made of ivory and gold
[21:06] and all of that and he was a man that
[21:09] his wisdom had went around the world a
[21:12] very profound gift that God gave him but
[21:16] his mother comes in
[21:17] and he is so humbled by the entrance of
[21:22] this virtuous woman that he gets up off
[21:25] of his throne and Bows himself to her
[21:29] now whether he bowed from the waist or
[21:32] whether he got totally down on his knee
[21:35] we don't know either way it was a great
[21:39] sign of his respect to his mother
[21:44] Bathsheba been a Delilah had she been a
[21:50] temptress a woman that used her beauty
[21:52] to seduce King David I find it hard to
[21:56] believe Solomon would have paid
[21:58] obeisance for such a woman
[22:02] so you know when you look at it there
[22:05] must have been something very
[22:06] outstanding about this woman now
[22:08] remember these five women that we want
[22:11] to look at by the grace of the Lord each
[22:13] one of them contribute something to
[22:15] making up the Future character of the
[22:19] Gentile bride
[22:21] Mary would be the only one that would
[22:24] not be tainted by some sort of sexual
[22:27] impurity
[22:29] so upon her entrance he arises and Bows
[22:34] before her and then he calls for a seat
[22:37] the Bible says but the Hebrew word there
[22:41] is actually a throne a magnificent seat
[22:45] or a throne that is brought and ordered
[22:49] to be set for her and she sets upon this
[22:53] Throne so she's elevated then from just
[22:57] being his mother to the first queen
[23:00] mother in the tribe of Israel
[23:03] so this woman now has begun to be raised
[23:08] up from her pain her anxiety her loss of
[23:13] her husband loss of her first son no
[23:17] doubt it made her very clingy to Solomon
[23:22] now she had another Son by the name of
[23:25] Nathan which would play a great part in
[23:28] the progeny of The Descent of the ascent
[23:31] brother of the Messiah to the throne she
[23:34] had two more Sons neither of these were
[23:37] Kings but yet they wound up being great
[23:40] men but yet no doubt there was still the
[23:44] memory of what she had participated in
[23:48] which was wrong in her first entrance to
[23:51] the king now Solomon didn't have her set
[23:54] way back behind him but he actually had
[23:58] her set almost on an equal place on his
[24:03] right hand now for those of you that
[24:06] have read the Bible you know that the
[24:08] Old Testament as well as the new uses
[24:11] the right hand as a special position of
[24:15] authority and power and this is where of
[24:18] course many people without an
[24:19] understanding of the godhead whenever
[24:21] they read in the Bible that Jesus has
[24:23] said on the right hand of God they get
[24:25] it in their mind that there's one throne
[24:27] for God and another throne for the Lord
[24:30] Jesus and he's sitting over here at
[24:32] God's right hand but the right hand
[24:35] actually means a symbol so it's a symbol
[24:38] of power and authority she doesn't ask
[24:42] for that but Solomon gives this to her
[24:46] out of great respect why am I doing this
[24:49] so it will help you to see what
[24:52] Bathsheba was and what she came out of
[24:55] and what she became
[24:58] so to me it's a picture of what God can
[25:02] do out of lives that are so bruised so
[25:06] wounded and so hurt and and what we
[25:10] bring to God many times people let that
[25:13] dictate and determine how they evaluate
[25:17] themselves people that come to God that
[25:20] have had a bad background and they've
[25:22] been into a lot of sin people that say
[25:25] they were married and divorced and then
[25:27] remarried or that they lived a very bad
[25:30] life out there and they tend to let that
[25:32] that affect who they think they are and
[25:36] they think other people look down on
[25:38] them and make them less than real
[25:40] genuine Christians and they think you
[25:43] know that they'll be second-class
[25:45] citizens as it were in heaven well let
[25:47] me just annihilate that today that is an
[25:50] absolute Lie from the Devil
[25:53] no matter what your past has been if you
[25:56] have been washed in the blood of the
[25:58] Lord Jesus as far as he is concerned you
[26:01] have no past
[26:03] that's right but yet people tend to come
[26:06] to the Lord and we all brought baggage
[26:09] when we come to the Lord so we bring
[26:11] memories we bring you know so many
[26:14] things that we come come loaded down
[26:17] even after we're saved and it's very
[26:19] hard to get rid of it but here is the
[26:21] epitome of a woman that I'm sure no
[26:25] doubt she would love for her past to
[26:28] have been totally eradicated and it's
[26:31] amazing when you look at her in the
[26:33] genealogy in the Book of Matthew that
[26:35] the Bible does not actually call her
[26:38] name it does not refer to her on a first
[26:41] name basis but it refers to her as
[26:45] having been the wife of Urias which is
[26:49] the New Testament form of Uriah and it's
[26:52] also astounding whenever you look at
[26:54] Rahab brought over to the New Testament
[26:57] that Rahab is still called Rahab the
[27:01] Harlot now you sing how in the world
[27:05] would that be how would she be brought
[27:07] through the cross because the New
[27:09] Testament was written after the death of
[27:11] the Lord Jesus on the cross and yet that
[27:14] identity is still still who she is so
[27:17] she's called Rahab the hearted in the
[27:20] book of Hebrews also in the Book of
[27:22] James well why didn't God eliminate that
[27:25] not whenever you think of it God
[27:27] certainly have could have done that but
[27:29] to me there's something set forth that
[27:32] it displays the abundance of his grace
[27:35] that he wants people to know what she
[27:38] was in that past life but it was the
[27:42] grace of God that put her in the
[27:45] genealogy of the Lord Jesus himself
[27:49] so when it comes to Bathsheba in the New
[27:52] Testament her name is not even found
[27:54] it's not even mentioned but she was
[27:57] given a higher honor than for her name
[28:00] to be mentioned in so much that she was
[28:03] of the of the patronage of the Lord
[28:06] Jesus a great great great great great
[28:08] great on back grandmother of the human
[28:11] body of Jesus Christ now most of us of
[28:15] course we know will never be rich people
[28:18] famous people will never make a great
[28:21] impression on the people of Life we'll
[28:23] Live our life we'll die we'll bury we'll
[28:26] be buried go to the Grave we'll rot
[28:28] we'll go back to the dust of the earth
[28:29] if the Lord tarries in a few years most
[28:32] people will never even have a very faint
[28:34] memory that we existed but yet God has
[28:38] given us the highest position that could
[28:41] ever be given to human beings and that
[28:44] he chose to live in our bodies
[28:48] you talking about a blessed people now
[28:51] one of these days the name of Eisenhower
[28:53] and the name of pharaoh and the name of
[28:56] Elvis and the name of this person and
[28:59] that person that is so famous and people
[29:02] think they are so great one day those
[29:05] names will absolutely be forgotten by
[29:08] the redeemed human race but your name
[29:11] will live on forever
[29:14] your position as the bride of Christ
[29:17] will be forever in the heavens just as
[29:21] Eternal as God himself is so it all
[29:23] depends on how you value who and where
[29:27] you are now for Bathsheba this this
[29:31] thing I think needs to be brought into
[29:33] view that God used this personally this
[29:38] woman to be able to rewrite the story of
[29:41] her life now as I said I believe that
[29:44] God takes each one of these women and
[29:46] they bring something a little different
[29:48] into the Kaleidoscope of how God is
[29:52] going to make this bride in the last day
[29:55] of course the last two thousand years
[29:57] he's been working on a gentile bride and
[30:01] Rahab brings something very unique very
[30:04] special Ruth does as well but yet we
[30:07] find Bathsheba she brings something that
[30:10] is totally different it is a lineage by
[30:15] which God will bring the very image of
[30:18] the son of David now the son of David
[30:20] was not brought in the lineage of Rahab
[30:24] the son of David was not brought in the
[30:27] lineage of ruse but the son of David is
[30:30] going to be brought in the lineage of
[30:33] Bathsheba now look at Solomon if any of
[30:36] you your mother would have been a say a
[30:39] bad woman and she lived maybe even
[30:43] before she got saved and she was out on
[30:46] the street and she lived a very bad life
[30:48] and some of you found out about that
[30:51] about your mother and it would kind of
[30:54] be sort of embarrassing that your mother
[30:56] was that way and you probably wouldn't
[30:58] want many people to know about it and in
[31:01] your Humanity you probably still might
[31:04] struggle with a little bit you know how
[31:06] could Mama have done that and how could
[31:08] she have done this but there must have
[31:10] been something so outstanding about out
[31:14] the character of Bathsheba not that she
[31:18] was a bad type of woman and forgiven for
[31:22] that awful thing that she was but
[31:25] something that was so profound about her
[31:28] and she was thrown into this and it made
[31:32] an impression on Solomon's life
[31:36] we have no record of what Nathan her
[31:39] third son thought about her we have no
[31:42] record of what showbab and the his other
[31:45] brother thought about her but we do have
[31:49] the record of what Solomon thought about
[31:52] her we really don't get an Insight of
[31:55] how it was to be raised in the home of
[31:58] King David but I do find it astounding
[32:01] that Solomon never wrote about his
[32:05] relationship in with his father King
[32:09] David in the way that he did his mother
[32:12] Queen Bathsheba now what this is
[32:15] astounding to me because you think this
[32:18] is David's son and this is the son that
[32:22] is going to take David's place and yet
[32:24] Solomon does not relate to him in the
[32:27] same way that he does Bathsheba now no
[32:30] doubt David was busy and he had a lot of
[32:32] things going on in his life and many of
[32:35] us fathers will attest especially as we
[32:38] get older that we would probably go back
[32:40] and do some things different with our
[32:43] daughters with our sons as I write any
[32:45] of you brothers look back and think yeah
[32:47] I would have done different I'd have
[32:49] made more time I would have done this or
[32:51] that or the other and it might have been
[32:53] that instance with David we just don't
[32:56] know but there was such an impression
[32:59] that Bathsheba made on his life that he
[33:03] writes about her in several different
[33:05] instances and what's this in Proverbs
[33:08] chapter 1 verse 8. look at Solomon's
[33:11] view now of a Godly mother
[33:14] my son hear the instruction of thy
[33:18] father and forsake not the law which is
[33:22] Torah the law of thy mother now notice
[33:26] he brings both father and mother
[33:28] together and he designates the
[33:31] instruction of the father so David must
[33:34] have instructed him and then he says
[33:36] forsake not the Torah the Torah now this
[33:40] is the same word that the Jews use in
[33:43] describing the Ten Commandments and
[33:46] Genesis and Exodus Leviticus Numbers and
[33:48] Deuteronomy and then this is what they
[33:51] call that as we said in English the
[33:52] Torah so Solomon of all the words that
[33:56] he could have used to describe the
[33:59] things that he got from Bathsheba he
[34:02] uses the word Torah as if he would place
[34:06] the instruction from his mother on this
[34:10] basis to use the same Hebrew word as the
[34:13] Ten Commandments and the book of Genesis
[34:15] and the Book of Exodus and Leviticus and
[34:17] numbers and Deuteronomy he must have
[34:20] valued the teaching of his mother very
[34:23] highly now teaching is not just
[34:26] necessarily the mother setting down and
[34:29] bringing a book out and you know saying
[34:32] that honey you'll not do this and thou
[34:34] shalt not do that thou shalt not do that
[34:36] but we know that teaching it involves
[34:39] Much More Than Just Words it involves
[34:42] Behavior it involves what we give to our
[34:45] children now I'm a Hunter and I'm out in
[34:48] the in nature a lot not the last few
[34:50] years so much but I watched how that
[34:53] that a hand turkey and how that she will
[34:56] get her little pulse as they call it
[34:59] around them now that hymn she's got
[35:01] several different chirps and several
[35:04] different things that she will use she
[35:07] used chirps and clucks and purrs and all
[35:11] types of different well it's turkey
[35:12] language I know some of you turkey
[35:14] humans don't know turkey turkey language
[35:16] but
[35:17] they have different little things and
[35:19] they communicate and being in the woods
[35:22] and you'll watch them and you'll watch
[35:23] how that she will do a certain prayer
[35:26] and they will do a certain thing they
[35:28] react accordingly and then she'll do a
[35:31] certain chirp and then she has this
[35:33] alarming sound and when she makes that
[35:36] alarming sound them little quotes I mean
[35:38] they may not be that big they've just
[35:40] been hatched out in the spring but when
[35:42] she sends that out they all go to
[35:44] getting on edge I mean they get all tore
[35:47] up they just go to looking around and
[35:49] looking around they don't see what she
[35:52] sees but they're really torn up by what
[35:54] they hear so they begin to react and
[35:58] they have a response to that well what
[36:00] are they what's them turkeys teaching
[36:02] their youngest they don't go to Turkey
[36:03] school they don't ever graduate from
[36:05] Turkey college so where do they get that
[36:08] now the Father which is the Tom he's not
[36:11] around them he has nothing to do with
[36:13] their upbringing absolutely not one
[36:15] thing that they don't even know who
[36:17] their daddy is
[36:18] so they are raised by their mother
[36:20] everything they will need in life
[36:23] because by the Fall they will be pretty
[36:25] good size by Spring the males will be
[36:27] Jakes and the females will be hens and
[36:30] wherever they learn how to live how
[36:32] where will they learn how to eat and
[36:34] what to eat how will they learn how to
[36:36] exist from their mother so their mother
[36:39] will when they're limited to chirps and
[36:41] purrs and all that she will convey to
[36:43] them but it's more than that they will
[36:46] learn from watching what she does so she
[36:49] raises that head up and looks around you
[36:52] can watch them they don't even know what
[36:53] they're looking for but all they know is
[36:55] she raised her head and they raise their
[36:57] head
[36:58] and they're trying to figure out what in
[37:00] the world am I looking for so they just
[37:02] looking I mean they're just looking hot
[37:04] because Mama's looking Mama's looking
[37:05] I'm looking
[37:07] you mothers have a great impact on what
[37:10] your children will become
[37:12] and you fathers do as well
[37:14] so Bathsheba was a woman which was of
[37:19] such noble character that she had not
[37:22] only a place in David's eyes and hope
[37:25] you understand this that that David
[37:27] actually did not fall in love with
[37:30] bathsheb but when he first saw her but
[37:33] David lusted after her beauty which is
[37:37] not the same thing as Falling in Love
[37:40] well somebody said amen
[37:43] so no doubt David had to fall in love
[37:47] with her and after this terrible
[37:49] terrible sin I'm sure that Bathsheba
[37:52] must have had a real struggle trying to
[37:55] fall in love with a man who killed her
[37:58] husband
[37:59] and also falling in love with a man
[38:01] because with this woman because of his
[38:04] sin her first baby died now this we have
[38:07] no record that she had any babies of her
[38:09] own with Uriah So This Woman's first
[38:12] baby was out of adultery and the baby
[38:15] dies so you can imagine now trying to
[38:18] fall in love with this man which has
[38:20] killed your husband and basically wind
[38:23] up killing your firstborn son so she
[38:26] must be over it by now and David
[38:29] comforted his wife so we see a different
[38:31] aspect of David's character now he's
[38:34] learning to love her and she is learning
[38:37] to love him and now they have this son
[38:40] and they call his name Solomon so some
[38:43] years go by and by the time we pick up
[38:45] on it here by the time that Solomon is
[38:48] now King the Bible doesn't actually give
[38:51] us a time frame by which this was
[38:52] written but we can see early on the
[38:55] influence of this Godly mother read them
[38:58] in Proverbs 6 2 20 and the Bible said my
[39:01] son keep thy father's commandment now he
[39:03] says it a little different and forsake
[39:06] not the law of thy mother again the
[39:09] Torah the law of thy mother the word
[39:12] mother is mentioned 15 times in the Book
[39:16] of Proverbs alone always in the sense of
[39:21] honor and respect that a good Godly
[39:24] mother should have and everybody said
[39:27] now let us move to Proverbs chapter 31
[39:30] verse 1. Now we move into a perspective
[39:34] about Bathsheba which I'm not sure if
[39:37] you've ever looked at it quite this way
[39:38] before but actually Bathsheba moves in
[39:42] under a spirit of Prophecy
[39:46] Bathsheba Not only was David's beloved
[39:51] wife and Solomon and Nathan and shobab
[39:53] and the other young man's mother but she
[39:57] was a woman that sought after God she
[40:01] was a woman that loved God now this is
[40:04] very unusual for women of the Old
[40:05] Testament but there were a few of them
[40:07] that were allowed to have this type of
[40:09] position and she was one of them but
[40:12] this woman had some insight
[40:14] prophetically into the life of her son
[40:18] Solomon now the Bible doesn't tell us
[40:19] that she did or showbab or of Nathan or
[40:22] any of the other of her family but she
[40:24] actually prophesied to saw Solomon of
[40:29] his future demise
[40:32] now listen the words of King Lemuel the
[40:37] words of King Lemuel
[40:41] the prophecy that his mother taught him
[40:46] now the word Lemuel there is no such
[40:50] king of course in the tribal order of
[40:55] any of the Jews either on the side of
[40:57] Judah or the side of Israel there is no
[41:01] known kings that you can trace back in
[41:05] the entire Mediterranean era during this
[41:09] time frame that Sodom and lived so it is
[41:13] assumed that this was a name that
[41:16] Bathsheba gave to Solomon herself like
[41:20] we would have names that we would call
[41:22] our children my oldest daughter her name
[41:25] is Alicia Yvonne Babb and but we've
[41:29] always called her Lish for short and so
[41:32] you know how we do that we will call our
[41:34] kids certain names and our husbands and
[41:36] our wives depending on what mood Ram
[41:38] whenever we call them
[41:40] anyway that's another tournament so this
[41:43] is assumed that this is what she called
[41:47] her son Solomon now God had already
[41:50] given him a pet name and it was Jedediah
[41:54] so Lambeau where this is his name and
[41:58] when Solomon goes to writing this down
[42:01] he refers to himself as the name that
[42:05] his mother called him now notice he said
[42:07] the words of King Lemuel the prophecy
[42:11] the prophecy that his mother taught him
[42:16] so his mother
[42:18] Bathsheba began to give Solomon some
[42:22] words about his future now if you read
[42:25] this it's absolutely astounding in the
[42:28] sense of the way that she began to speak
[42:31] of how monarchs should and should not
[42:35] live
[42:36] she began to tell him how the king
[42:39] should not drink wine
[42:41] she began to tell him of how the Kings
[42:45] should not become violated by women she
[42:49] began to tell him now remember this is
[42:51] early on in in Solomon's Reign and by
[42:55] this time he had married all of these
[42:57] women of course and he had not begin to
[42:59] pull his heart away from God by idolatry
[43:03] but Bathsheba began to prophesy
[43:07] and she tells him it's really sad to me
[43:12] it's so sad because she was inspired by
[43:15] God to tell him of his future and he
[43:19] even acknowledged it but instead of him
[43:21] going ahead and obeying it he goes right
[43:24] ahead and does the opposite of what his
[43:27] mother prophesies for him to do
[43:31] now
[43:32] think of it how odd that it must have
[43:35] been that here is King David not the
[43:39] name Lemuel simply means unto God or
[43:43] with God now this man has a very special
[43:46] place so he's beloved of God of being
[43:49] his name given by Nathan the prophet and
[43:53] now he's with God or part of God around
[43:57] God and the spirit of God comes upon his
[44:00] mother now we don't know she was not a
[44:04] prophetess as far as we know but it was
[44:06] something how the grace of God would
[44:09] take her out of the position that she
[44:11] was in and bring her into a place that
[44:15] this greatest King that ever lived on
[44:18] the Earth would be able to take from the
[44:21] teachings of his mother and be able to
[44:24] set forth Proverbs Chapter 31. so she
[44:29] was a woman of Great Value a woman of
[44:32] Grace great Insight now remember I'm not
[44:34] just talking about Bathsheba but I'm
[44:36] talking about her input of the Bride
[44:39] type down through the Gentile Church
[44:41] ages notice with me now in verse 2 what
[44:45] my son and what the son of my womb and
[44:51] what the son of my vows so hear the
[44:55] poetic name that she gives to Solomon
[44:58] and she addresses him
[45:01] to deal with her son and you know and
[45:05] you think wow well why didn't David tell
[45:07] him this well we don't know that David
[45:08] didn't tell them but if David did say
[45:11] this somehow it had more impact upon Him
[45:14] hearing it from his mother and yet David
[45:17] was a prophet the Bible tells us in the
[45:20] book of Acts that David was a prophet
[45:22] and yet here it was we have no record
[45:25] that David ever told Solomon any
[45:28] prophecy of his end any prophecy of what
[45:31] was going to happen to him but here
[45:33] Solomon is revealing to us the prophecy
[45:38] that has so burned and etched upon him
[45:41] at least in his use and it come from his
[45:44] mother and she calls Lemuel the son of
[45:49] her vows now remember her first son was
[45:53] born out of adultery and he died but now
[45:56] she has a son which is given to her
[45:59] under the correct marriage vows and this
[46:03] son is one who's named with God or part
[46:06] of God so she calls him the son of her
[46:10] vows because her and David had got
[46:13] legally and rightfully married because
[46:16] of the broken vows with Uriah the first
[46:21] son was destined to die but this one is
[46:25] going to live in so much that God would
[46:30] call him his own son
[46:32] God said he will be my son and I will be
[46:38] his father
[46:40] so this one was a son of her vows I
[46:44] ain't got time to go into it this
[46:45] morning but if you look at this right
[46:46] here you see exactly the whole church
[46:48] and the bride church right down Through
[46:50] the Ages and you've got that
[46:52] church so it has many more children than
[46:54] the bride ever will and they will all
[46:57] die because they're born out of the
[46:59] broken vows between their mother and God
[47:03] but the bride will give birth to Christ
[47:06] the word him I know the body of Christ
[47:07] is not yet completed and the prophet
[47:09] tells us that in marriage and divorce
[47:11] but the bride will give the completion
[47:14] give Christ what he wants and that is a
[47:17] body living down through the church ages
[47:19] and produce a millennium out of her womb
[47:23] well praise the Lord out of the marriage
[47:25] supper of the Lamb will give birth to a
[47:28] millennium Reign by Christ and the bride
[47:31] being joined together and the Bride As
[47:33] the word will be able to stand there and
[47:35] say this is the son of my vows that I
[47:39] had with Christ my mate I did not break
[47:42] his word I did not wind up in the
[47:45] tribulation period the reason the church
[47:46] are going to tribulation period is
[47:49] because they're giving birth to children
[47:50] that are born out of broken vows with
[47:54] God
[47:55] but the bride don't break her vows she
[47:58] keeps her promise to the Lord and out of
[48:01] her her Union with Christ will come a
[48:04] millennium Reign and the bride will
[48:06] produce what not the son of man not the
[48:09] Son of God but the son of David
[48:13] praise the Lord notice out of Bathsheba
[48:18] then comes Solomon who is white the son
[48:21] of David
[48:23] now because of these broken vows this
[48:26] son will die now notice her prophecy
[48:28] that she gives to Solomon in verse 3
[48:31] give not thy strengths unto women nor
[48:36] thy ways to that which destroyest Kings
[48:39] now this was a prophecy Solomon called
[48:43] it so don't give your strength to women
[48:45] now who is this that is telling him this
[48:49] Bathsheba
[48:51] now if she would have been a temptress
[48:54] if she would have been a seductive woman
[48:56] that was trying to lay weight to King
[48:59] David do you think this man would have
[49:01] paid any attention to this
[49:04] that would be like a prostitute trying
[49:06] to tell you don't take up my ways don't
[49:09] do this and that and the other but
[49:10] Solomon had such respect for her and no
[49:13] doubt painfully she related this story
[49:17] to Solomon of how she was introduced
[49:21] into the throne and how that David
[49:24] forced himself basically upon her and
[49:28] yet he looked at her as being the victim
[49:31] of this first situation not being the
[49:35] cause
[49:37] now let me go ahead and say there are
[49:39] people under the sound of my voice today
[49:41] both visible and those that will stream
[49:44] this
[49:46] many of you are victims of a strong
[49:49] powerful leader
[49:51] some of you are victims of a father
[49:53] abusing you or a leader or a ruler or a
[49:58] teacher whatever more
[50:00] some of you were abused verbally
[50:03] some of you were raised by strong
[50:05] dominant female mother
[50:08] that Soul ran your home
[50:11] and some of you were abused by a father
[50:15] maybe not sexually but maybe verbally
[50:18] never letting you know that he loved you
[50:21] and some of you to this day still
[50:22] decades later searching for approval
[50:25] from people searching for approval from
[50:29] men this is why you acclimate toward
[50:32] leaders and why you acclimate toward men
[50:35] that have a role of authority because
[50:38] that something is still missing in you
[50:41] and you seek and search for approval for
[50:46] from men opposition
[50:48] but let me just say this to you today
[50:50] you can let those things dictate to you
[50:53] and let them rule you or you can be like
[50:56] Bathsheba was and you can move beyond
[51:00] the hurt did she ever forget it I dare
[51:02] say brother Joel she never forgot it
[51:04] she'd probably never forgot it and
[51:07] probably regretted ever even been where
[51:09] David could even see her in any means
[51:12] did she regret becoming his wife legally
[51:15] later nope I'm no doubt in my mind that
[51:18] she knew that was exactly where she was
[51:20] supposed to be but it was the way she
[51:23] got there
[51:24] and when with us I'm sure many of us we
[51:27] have regrets in our life of this and
[51:29] that and the other but what are you
[51:30] going to do with those those regrets
[51:32] you're going to let them dominate you
[51:34] and let them rule you the rest of your
[51:36] life or are you going to bring your
[51:38] shattered ruins of your life and bring
[51:41] them to the Lord and say Lord here it is
[51:43] I don't know what else to do but to
[51:45] bring all of it if you can do something
[51:47] with it Lord I came my mama can't fix it
[51:50] my pastor can't fix it nobody else can
[51:52] fix it so I bring it all to you and
[51:54] commit it to you take the garbage of my
[51:57] life and process it and turn it into an
[51:59] image of the grace of God
[52:02] Hallelujah
[52:06] you remember the prophet telling us the
[52:09] story of how they used to make paper and
[52:11] many of you are familiar with the story
[52:13] how that they would take uh rags and
[52:16] they would take cloths and they would
[52:18] put them into a process and they would
[52:21] be able to turn it into paper and the
[52:24] Queen of England went to this plant one
[52:26] day and and they took her through the
[52:28] different processes of it and the man
[52:30] that was leading around took her to a
[52:32] room that was all filled up with all
[52:35] types of old clothes and you know how
[52:37] close are they can retain smell so she
[52:40] goes inside of there and she sees all
[52:42] those clothes and that power said words
[52:45] there said oh what is this and the man
[52:48] that was leading around said these are
[52:50] old clothes this is what we use we run
[52:52] them through the process and turn them
[52:55] into paper so what is old dirty rags
[52:58] today will become paper tomorrow so the
[53:01] queen just couldn't hardly comprehend
[53:03] that but what the man did was he run on
[53:07] some clothes through the process and he
[53:09] took the Queen's profile and put the
[53:12] crane the Queen's profile on this
[53:15] process paper and sent it to her so that
[53:19] she would be able to know what the
[53:21] process would be able to do maybe the
[53:25] Lord can take the hurts of our lives and
[53:28] the rags of this and that and the other
[53:30] and run it through the process of not
[53:33] our pride and our arrogance and our
[53:35] self-help books and all this and that
[53:37] but through the grace of God
[53:39] and right at the rags of our life and
[53:42] the refuse of our life and the basic of
[53:44] the garbage of our life and run it
[53:46] through a process and not so much the
[53:49] image of the queen but may the image of
[53:51] the king be impressed Upon Our Lives I
[53:54] don't know about you there could be no
[53:56] greater honor that could ever be given
[53:58] to me as a Son of God living on the
[54:00] earth that when I complete my life's
[54:03] journey that the image of the king could
[54:06] be embossed upon the image of my life
[54:09] and I will find myself standing there in
[54:12] a body like his own glorious body
[54:16] Hallelujah that's when I will be totally
[54:19] completely satisfied and know that the
[54:22] image has been born through and through
[54:25] and I will stand there and have a body
[54:27] like his own body
[54:30] isn't that what we want
[54:32] notice now how that she goes on with
[54:35] this prophecy give not thy strength I
[54:37] love this because here Solomon is
[54:39] writing this though it's in the third
[54:41] person himself but he's writing this as
[54:44] if though Bathsheba is speaking it and
[54:47] he changes on it so watch him now as the
[54:49] actors will change from one part to
[54:51] another give not thy strengths unto
[54:54] women nor thy ways to that which destroy
[54:57] us Kings is it not for Kings oh Lemuel
[55:01] is it not for Kings to not drink wine
[55:04] nor for Prince's strong drink now what
[55:08] she has broke into an understanding or
[55:12] if the people could only hear the
[55:14] prophetic utterance of the Bride As she
[55:18] started uttering Force the command of
[55:20] God in the book of Acts if they could
[55:23] have only heard the prophecy from Luther
[55:25] if they could have only heard the
[55:28] prophecy from Wesley if they could have
[55:30] only heard the prophecy from
[55:33] if they could only hear the prophecy
[55:36] that's still ongoing right now what do
[55:38] you mean brother Donnie through the
[55:40] ministry of the hour telling the bride
[55:43] to get ready get ready the Lord is
[55:46] coming get ready the Lord is coming
[55:51] praise the lord and there will be an
[55:53] element of people of course that will
[55:55] and there'll be an element of people
[55:56] that want there will actually be some
[55:58] that will be like Solomon that will hear
[56:00] it that will respect it that will pay an
[56:03] element of honor to it and still won't
[56:06] obey it this is what makes it so sad to
[56:08] me it's about Solomon the Solomon knew
[56:11] these things and you can tell in his use
[56:13] that he actually cherished them and gave
[56:15] them a great spot in his life as
[56:18] Proverbs goes on and he begins to write
[56:20] and you move from Proverbs over into
[56:22] Ecclesiastes which they say it's written
[56:24] a few years after Proverbs in Solomon
[56:27] it's now he's tasted a lot of the things
[56:30] of life and he said I've drank and I've
[56:32] done this and that and the other and he
[56:34] said I've known all these pleasures and
[56:36] none of them produce any happiness at
[56:38] all by this time he's already turned
[56:41] several years and he's gotten much of
[56:43] this behind him in Proverbs he's still
[56:45] at the youth stage and he's always
[56:48] honoring this word and how he loves this
[56:51] prophecy but by the time he gets to
[56:53] Ecclesiastes he's already married all
[56:56] these women he's done on all these
[56:57] things and he don't even know what's
[56:59] real no more he don't even know how I've
[57:01] looked for happiness here and I've
[57:02] looked for it there and I'm so
[57:04] dissatisfied it's all vanity it's vanity
[57:07] it's all vanity
[57:09] that is a very sad individual
[57:14] oh my notice she says lest they drink
[57:17] and forget the law and pervert the
[57:20] Judgment of any of The Afflicted now
[57:22] notice what Bathsheba is doing she is
[57:25] prophetically giving to Solomon a
[57:28] warning of what lays for Kings now this
[57:30] is what lays for all Kings so him being
[57:33] a king the potential of becoming this
[57:36] prophecy certainly lays before him but
[57:38] it's by choice he did not have to she's
[57:41] setting it forth this is what you can
[57:43] become we as a message church as message
[57:46] people we can become cold indifferent we
[57:51] are in laodicea in the time frame but we
[57:54] do not have to be lay of the sins we can
[57:57] be called we can become indifferent we
[57:59] can say well God don't really matter no
[58:01] more I go to church it's just something
[58:03] I do socially well if that's what you
[58:05] want to do it's up to you but you don't
[58:06] have to or he can be your life he can be
[58:09] your love he can be everything to you
[58:17] prophetically the laodicea and age will
[58:19] think they are rich and increase with
[58:21] goods and have need him nothing but nor
[58:23] shall not that thou art wretched and
[58:25] poor and blind and naked that's what the
[58:27] prophecy said that ain't going to be me
[58:30] because that's not who I am I choose not
[58:33] to fulfill that prophecy what about
[58:36] anybody else sure this morning I choose
[58:39] not to fulfill thy prophecy some men are
[58:42] going to fall under adultery now I'm not
[58:44] going to do it I choose to fulfill the
[58:46] prophecy there will be a bride but the
[58:48] child that will be faithful to the Lord
[58:51] they will stay true on his word it's up
[58:54] to you the mule
[59:00] oh my notice in verse 8. open thy mouth
[59:05] for the dumb and the cause of
[59:08] all such as are appointed to destruction
[59:12] now notice she's given him advice of how
[59:15] a king should be that a king should not
[59:18] just be the voice of the rich
[59:21] and the voice of the important but also
[59:25] the voice of those who have no voice so
[59:27] she uses the word dumb doesn't
[59:30] necessarily mean they couldn't talk but
[59:32] being poor and outcast in the lowest of
[59:34] the Kingdom they might as well not be
[59:36] able to speak
[59:37] but she's instructing him Lemuel don't
[59:41] be that way
[59:43] don't be that way don't don't forget
[59:45] where God brought me from
[59:49] how could she say this by experience
[59:52] because she had no choice and no voice
[59:56] when the king beckoned her to his bed
[1:00:04] open thy mouth
[1:00:07] judge
[1:00:08] righteously
[1:00:10] and plead the cause of the poor
[1:00:14] and needy
[1:00:16] wow
[1:00:18] Bathsheba endured much
[1:00:22] and overcome
[1:00:27] God is now redeeming
[1:00:31] bathsheba's pain
[1:00:34] now let's go to proverbs 31 verse 10.
[1:00:38] now remember the Jewish historians
[1:00:42] they say that Proverbs 31
[1:00:46] was written about
[1:00:49] Bathsheba
[1:00:51] but I myself I see more than Bathsheba
[1:00:54] in these verses
[1:00:56] I see the bride
[1:00:59] I see some of our sisters of West well
[1:01:01] of course
[1:01:02] notice in Proverbs 31 10 who can find
[1:01:08] a virtuous woman
[1:01:11] her price is far
[1:01:14] above rubies who can find I want you to
[1:01:17] notice how that now it shifts
[1:01:20] from Bathsheba to Solomon now he's going
[1:01:24] to take it in first person uh and by
[1:01:27] this time no doubt he's he's a great
[1:01:29] Monarch and he's been introduced to all
[1:01:31] types of women uh women of royalty women
[1:01:34] of low degree all types of women and
[1:01:37] he's already started noticing in the
[1:01:40] conquest or the search of humanity maybe
[1:01:43] still looking for wives I mean a man
[1:01:45] that had that many still looking about
[1:01:46] everywhere he went I would think
[1:01:47] wouldn't you
[1:01:48] I thank God we don't believe in polygamy
[1:01:52] I think there's something a little bit
[1:01:53] missing in a man's mind than one a
[1:01:55] thousand wives good Lord sometimes it's
[1:01:57] hard enough having one my son's five or
[1:01:59] six hundred or a thousand
[1:02:01] hey I love my wife I wouldn't take
[1:02:02] nothing away for but I wouldn't want
[1:02:04] 500.
[1:02:06] glory to God brother Donald come up here
[1:02:08] let me cast that devil off of you
[1:02:15] but I want you to notice that that
[1:02:16] Solomon's thought is not about polygamy
[1:02:21] right here he has the mindset of who can
[1:02:24] find he doesn't put it in plural who can
[1:02:27] find virtuous women
[1:02:30] that I want all of these women I want
[1:02:32] all of them his mindset is still correct
[1:02:36] who can find a virtuous woman
[1:02:39] one
[1:02:41] so no doubt he's seen many hundreds of
[1:02:44] thousands and they would come at his
[1:02:45] court and the Kings and the princes
[1:02:47] would come from the different nations
[1:02:48] that would be around it you'll imagine
[1:02:50] it was a constant influx of people
[1:02:52] coming to see King Solomon and they
[1:02:54] would bring their daughters and the
[1:02:56] other daughters was marriageable ages
[1:02:57] and maybe they were fat and some of them
[1:03:00] were skinny and some of them were you
[1:03:01] know just all types of different ways
[1:03:03] but Solomon could tell but look at him
[1:03:04] the way they were they were not
[1:03:06] interested in character they were
[1:03:08] interested in being the wife of Solomon
[1:03:10] and the perfect type of the churches the
[1:03:13] churches are not interested in living
[1:03:14] right many of them are not interested in
[1:03:16] pleasing the Lord Jesus they don't want
[1:03:18] to go to hell
[1:03:20] they don't want to be lost so you know
[1:03:22] what they they cite a book and they'll
[1:03:24] put their name on a book they'll shake a
[1:03:26] preacher's hand because they do not want
[1:03:27] to go to hell but the bride does just
[1:03:30] not want to go to hell she wants to
[1:03:32] please him
[1:03:36] who can find a virtuous woman
[1:03:40] now hold your place sir but read also
[1:03:42] with me in Proverbs chapter 12 verse 4 a
[1:03:45] virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
[1:03:51] but she that maketh ashamed is as
[1:03:54] rottenness in his bones
[1:03:58] so a virtuous woman that is one whose
[1:04:02] portrait is traced with the words of
[1:04:07] Proverbs 31. now already in chapter 12
[1:04:11] he's talking about this virtuous woman
[1:04:14] well where did he get this example his
[1:04:16] mother
[1:04:17] Bathsheba you see such a woman is not
[1:04:21] simply loving and modest and nice but
[1:04:25] she is a crown to her husband now think
[1:04:29] of what women can be from a scriptural
[1:04:32] perspective that they are not a floor
[1:04:34] mat they are not to be a sex Queen they
[1:04:38] are not to be under the feet of a man
[1:04:42] well praise the Lord real Godly
[1:04:45] Daughters of God are not second-class
[1:04:47] citizens in the economy they've got the
[1:04:50] same Holy Ghost any man's God
[1:04:52] they've got the same blood of the Lord
[1:04:54] Jesus as a matter of fact they overcome
[1:04:57] more you believe what you want to
[1:04:59] believe I believe the daughters of God
[1:05:01] that have lived down Through the Ages
[1:05:03] will have such an exceeding great reward
[1:05:06] because so much of the fashion so much
[1:05:09] of the world and so on is aimed at our
[1:05:12] daughters when the daughters of God
[1:05:14] thrown the streets of Glory I think
[1:05:16] we're going to be surprised surprised
[1:05:18] how heaven will react when our sisters
[1:05:22] walk down streets of gold because I have
[1:05:25] more hell aimed at them to have more of
[1:05:28] the things of the world I wish somebody
[1:05:30] preached with me this morning and when
[1:05:32] they get there the Lord God will reward
[1:05:35] them with such a tremendous reward
[1:05:39] well let's go ahead and give them a
[1:05:40] husband
[1:05:42] a praise right now
[1:05:50] well there you go sisters
[1:05:55] you see a real virtuous woman
[1:05:58] actually crowns
[1:06:01] her husband's life
[1:06:04] what an awesome thing
[1:06:07] now I want you to notice that Solomon
[1:06:09] does not liken a real virtuous woman to
[1:06:13] being the ring on his finger
[1:06:17] he doesn't liken her to being a necklace
[1:06:20] around his neck
[1:06:22] he doesn't liken her to being a toe ring
[1:06:25] on his little teenagito
[1:06:28] under his feet
[1:06:31] but he Likens her to being her husband's
[1:06:34] crown
[1:06:36] wow
[1:06:38] you mean a woman that has that type of
[1:06:41] value in the eyes of God yeah
[1:06:44] now this remember this imprint comes
[1:06:47] from who a man that is the wisest man in
[1:06:51] all of the world at this time
[1:06:53] but he was raised by a woman
[1:06:57] who was the crown of her husband
[1:07:01] oh
[1:07:02] no doubt David's Crown was beautiful and
[1:07:06] no doubt the people of the Kingdom would
[1:07:07] come in and look at him and the people
[1:07:09] from other kingdoms would come in and
[1:07:11] look at the crown but actually the crown
[1:07:14] on David's head was not the crown of
[1:07:18] David's life
[1:07:21] the crown of David's life
[1:07:24] was bath
[1:07:28] well I'm gonna go ahead and say it hold
[1:07:30] on to your seat buckle up
[1:07:32] the crown of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:37] oh he will have a crown yes he will have
[1:07:40] a crown and we will put it on his head
[1:07:41] but hey the angels of God aren't going
[1:07:44] to bow down to the crown that will be
[1:07:46] placed upon his head the angels of God
[1:07:48] will not circle the Earth when the crown
[1:07:51] is brought from the throne room and
[1:07:53] placed upon his head but when his crown
[1:07:57] when his crown is brought before him
[1:08:00] don't you understand why this bride
[1:08:02] means so much to him don't you
[1:08:05] understand why he has never been crowned
[1:08:07] to this day our lord Jesus Remember when
[1:08:11] Saint Martin was in his room and this
[1:08:13] angelic appearance come into his room
[1:08:15] and there was a bright light and so on
[1:08:17] and the angel spoke to him and said
[1:08:18] Martin don't you know me I'm your Lord
[1:08:21] and Master I'm Jesus Christ Bow Down and
[1:08:24] Worship me Martin and Martin looked at
[1:08:26] him and he looked at him and again the
[1:08:28] voice said don't you know me Martin I'm
[1:08:30] the Lord Jesus bow down before him and
[1:08:33] he said get behind me Satan I rebuke you
[1:08:35] our Lord has not yet been crowned he
[1:08:39] will be crowned by his bride
[1:08:41] what is very fitting that the bride
[1:08:45] crowned him since she is his
[1:08:51] don't you understand Angels cannot crown
[1:08:54] him the universe is not his girl Heavens
[1:08:58] are not his crown the Earth is not his
[1:09:01] crown his people
[1:09:04] or his crown
[1:09:09] huh
[1:09:11] listen to me Brothers
[1:09:15] man needs
[1:09:17] such a woman
[1:09:20] to Crown
[1:09:22] or complete his life
[1:09:26] you said how can you say that from the
[1:09:29] example of the first man in the Garden
[1:09:30] of Eden
[1:09:32] a man living in complete perfection
[1:09:36] he never had to get up and work he never
[1:09:38] had to get up and worry he never had to
[1:09:41] fret he never had anxiety he never had
[1:09:44] low blood pressure high blood pressure
[1:09:47] he never had heart palpitations he never
[1:09:49] had nothing going on that was not one
[1:09:52] bad day but God looked at him and said
[1:09:54] it's not good for the man to be without
[1:09:56] a crown
[1:09:58] in other words it's not good for the man
[1:10:01] to be alone
[1:10:03] and you're as a man that was living in
[1:10:05] absolute perfection in the Garden of
[1:10:07] Eden but the thing that wasn't complete
[1:10:10] was he was missing something what was it
[1:10:13] the crown of his life
[1:10:15] so we know the story and God shows the
[1:10:18] epitome of his love by bringing this man
[1:10:22] a crown
[1:10:23] with the joys that she brought to him
[1:10:27] it's easy in one way for us to see why
[1:10:30] when she fell and did wrong that Adam
[1:10:34] was willing to Forfeit his godship in
[1:10:37] the Garden of Eden he remembered those
[1:10:39] days of being without a crown he
[1:10:43] remembered those days of being alone he
[1:10:45] was in total control he was the god of
[1:10:47] the earth everything was at his control
[1:10:50] and yet was all of that now that he had
[1:10:53] known this Crown he knew he could never
[1:10:56] be totally happy again so he was willing
[1:10:59] to Forfeit his godship and walk out with
[1:11:02] this woman because he could not think
[1:11:04] about living another day without her now
[1:11:07] he had more ribs that's true but you see
[1:11:10] when God opened up his body God went
[1:11:12] inside his body and pulled out a rib but
[1:11:15] God went into the second dimension of
[1:11:17] man and he divided his spirit and he
[1:11:19] pulled the feminist qualities out of
[1:11:22] Adam's spirit and and place them inside
[1:11:24] this body Adam had more ribs but he
[1:11:28] didn't have no more spirit in him
[1:11:30] Hallelujah
[1:11:32] to give birth to another bride
[1:11:36] oh Lord God
[1:11:38] man needed this type of a being
[1:11:42] that would complement his kingdom
[1:11:46] he needs her because
[1:11:48] she will mirror a Divine image of what
[1:11:52] the bride will mirror in God hope you
[1:11:55] understand it the prophet says it this
[1:11:57] way God is not complete
[1:12:01] without you
[1:12:07] oh I know I know I know it's hard to
[1:12:09] comprehend and we say oh he needs us we
[1:12:11] need him brother we need him and we
[1:12:13] absolutely do every day of our life but
[1:12:15] he has so orchestrated his program he
[1:12:18] absolutely needs you
[1:12:20] Hallelujah
[1:12:22] oh don't you love him
[1:12:24] you imagine he needs her because she
[1:12:27] helps balance him and different aspects
[1:12:30] of his life and the man needs virtue
[1:12:33] outside of himself to complement who he
[1:12:37] is
[1:12:38] so the woman can crown him and there's
[1:12:41] things that can be said about a man's
[1:12:43] wife of course it cannot be said about
[1:12:45] him there's things that can be said
[1:12:47] about the bride if you will it is those
[1:12:50] traits and characteristics that was in
[1:12:52] the Eternal before there was ever a
[1:12:55] world but for those ever in the element
[1:12:56] of time or Adams or molecules these
[1:12:59] attributes were in him and he thought of
[1:13:01] himself as being tangible and he thought
[1:13:04] of me he thought of you future home the
[1:13:06] prophet tells us he thought of himself
[1:13:07] of becoming a human being and that
[1:13:10] projected him down to becoming Jesus
[1:13:13] Christ so God transmitted himself down
[1:13:17] that part of himself down on this
[1:13:20] Christmas morn
[1:13:21] Hallelujah
[1:13:23] but then that was not all that he was
[1:13:27] Hallelujah Jesus was the human
[1:13:30] expression of God
[1:13:33] but Jesus needed
[1:13:35] a crown
[1:13:38] thank you Lord God
[1:13:41] you see that's the man who would be
[1:13:43] crowned with this
[1:13:46] must pray so fervently
[1:13:49] to get the right choice in life
[1:13:55] so if a woman is to Crown a man's life
[1:14:00] if a man gets the wrong one
[1:14:05] think of what she mirrors
[1:14:08] in that man's life
[1:14:12] well if y'all get any quieter we're
[1:14:13] going to go into negative dis decibels
[1:14:20] you see Solomon looks at her
[1:14:24] and he says she is a virtuous woman is
[1:14:27] so great and so profound her price is
[1:14:31] greater than rubies
[1:14:34] now remember at this time in
[1:14:35] Civilization rubies were very rare they
[1:14:38] were very prized very beautiful
[1:14:42] so you could go down and pick up gravels
[1:14:44] about anywhere
[1:14:46] rocks about anywhere sand about anywhere
[1:14:50] where they lived at anyway
[1:14:52] but to find a woman
[1:14:54] a virtuous woman
[1:14:58] I hope you understand I ain't just
[1:15:00] talking about Bathsheba today I'm
[1:15:01] talking about the bride
[1:15:04] if God had not ordained a virtuous bride
[1:15:08] in every age
[1:15:09] Satan would have totally destroyed all
[1:15:13] of humanity
[1:15:16] just look at those of us who love him
[1:15:18] today with all of our hearts and if it
[1:15:20] wasn't for the grace of God our
[1:15:22] stupidity our Humanity our ignorance our
[1:15:25] shortcomings well come on brother Donnie
[1:15:28] all the things that we have done since
[1:15:30] we got saved where would we be if it
[1:15:34] wasn't for the grace of God
[1:15:40] notice in Proverbs 19 14 house and
[1:15:43] riches are the inheritance of fathers
[1:15:46] which is what fathers would pass down to
[1:15:48] their children and a Prudent Wife
[1:15:52] is from the Lord so then Solomon said
[1:15:57] that they were so rare I wonder how much
[1:15:59] more rare they are even day so good
[1:16:02] wives were then and even more so now a
[1:16:05] rare commodity
[1:16:07] given to sons of God prize even more
[1:16:11] than Ruby so The Virtuous Woman is to is
[1:16:14] a Dependable woman I put some of these
[1:16:17] things down so I wouldn't forget them
[1:16:18] one who can be counted on
[1:16:21] in every emergency
[1:16:25] she's capable
[1:16:27] and faithful
[1:16:29] for the high sense of the dignity and
[1:16:32] importance of administering the Affairs
[1:16:35] of the home
[1:16:36] her worst is beyond that of the most
[1:16:40] valuable jewels
[1:16:44] and how did Solomon know this not by the
[1:16:48] women he met
[1:16:50] but the one he lived with
[1:16:56] I remember many things about my mother
[1:17:01] and God knows
[1:17:03] I still miss her to this day
[1:17:07] I was never close to my daddy
[1:17:10] I was closer to my mother
[1:17:13] and before my daddy got saved I called
[1:17:15] Sinners he lived a wicked life of course
[1:17:19] and I can remember
[1:17:21] them having arguments and this and that
[1:17:24] and I can remember Mama crying and
[1:17:26] I just can go back and I will have
[1:17:29] relapses of it every now and then
[1:17:32] and I remember waking up in the night
[1:17:35] crying and hearing my daddy going to
[1:17:38] leave us
[1:17:40] Mount and Harry's room was right next
[1:17:42] door said this is the living room and
[1:17:43] that was the bedroom door and our bed
[1:17:45] was right against that wall I can
[1:17:47] remember running out of that wall that
[1:17:49] door one day and Daddy was going to
[1:17:52] leave
[1:17:52] and mama was begging him don't leave
[1:17:54] Dawn don't leave me and the kids don't
[1:17:56] leave
[1:17:57] and I run out of that room and fell at
[1:17:59] my daddy's feet and put my arms around
[1:18:01] his legs Daddy please don't leave please
[1:18:04] don't leave
[1:18:08] but what I remember about my mother is
[1:18:11] thinking this if I ever get married
[1:18:15] I'm going to treat my wife
[1:18:17] like a queen
[1:18:20] now maybe genetically or by DNA or just
[1:18:23] oh rottenness
[1:18:25] it probably should be in me to be like
[1:18:27] he was
[1:18:29] but instead of it being in me to be that
[1:18:32] way it made me so repulsive that I made
[1:18:36] up my mind now this is before I ever got
[1:18:38] saved this before I ever was called to
[1:18:40] preach of course he got the holy ghost
[1:18:41] or anything like that but it so set me
[1:18:43] in the opposite direction that I despise
[1:18:47] that
[1:18:48] and I still despise men
[1:18:51] that don't treat their wives in the
[1:18:54] right way
[1:18:57] well if you brothers can't say man can't
[1:18:59] your sister's at least bat your eyes
[1:19:01] real fast or something so I know
[1:19:02] somebody's hearing me this morning
[1:19:06] you see God knows how to make us and
[1:19:10] mold us as I look back to that God never
[1:19:11] made my daddy do any of those things and
[1:19:14] my daddy apologized to me years after
[1:19:16] all of that of course but it was not God
[1:19:18] that made my daddy doing those things
[1:19:20] but God took those things that I had
[1:19:22] those moldings that I had because God
[1:19:25] knew what I would become later in life
[1:19:27] and God knew that I would speak to tens
[1:19:30] of thousands and hundreds of thousands
[1:19:32] of his children to Through The Years so
[1:19:35] God let me be able to hear and and deal
[1:19:38] with some of those things you understand
[1:19:39] for yourself some of you look back and
[1:19:42] you think why would God let me go
[1:19:43] through this and why would God let me go
[1:19:45] through that well maybe God's got a
[1:19:47] bigger plan for you God wants to use
[1:19:49] what you've been through to help others
[1:19:51] so don't go around just feeling sorry
[1:19:53] for yourself all the time and well pull
[1:19:56] it on me and pour a little of that let
[1:19:58] God take them scars and them pains and
[1:20:01] let God be able to minister to others
[1:20:03] through the pain that you yourself have
[1:20:06] experienced experienced
[1:20:07] notice Solomon goes on to say in verse
[1:20:10] 11 the heart of her husband
[1:20:14] does safely trust in her
[1:20:17] the heart of her husband
[1:20:19] now this could not be said about
[1:20:22] Bathsheba where she an adulterous type
[1:20:27] of woman
[1:20:29] no matter how Solomon might have wanted
[1:20:31] to believe that it would have been so he
[1:20:33] could have never said that in all
[1:20:35] honesty had his mother been that type of
[1:20:38] a woman but she was not that type
[1:20:41] of a woman
[1:20:43] and may I say to you you were forced
[1:20:48] into your first marriage
[1:20:51] well I hope somebody's going to hear me
[1:20:53] you were forced into your first marriage
[1:20:56] and you were taken by that first husband
[1:21:00] who knew you in a sinful way against
[1:21:04] your own will
[1:21:06] that's right and God knew that
[1:21:09] Hallelujah as God knew it about
[1:21:12] Bathsheba she did not choose to commit
[1:21:15] adultery but David but she was forced
[1:21:18] into the situation and the relationship
[1:21:21] but once the vows changed and she got
[1:21:25] married to this man Hallelujah the right
[1:21:29] and proper way then God gave her a son
[1:21:33] out of this Union that God the Bible
[1:21:36] said the Lord loved him
[1:21:39] why because now God takes a situation
[1:21:43] that is bad a situation that isn't good
[1:21:46] and God turns it right around and
[1:21:49] anoints this woman to be one of the most
[1:21:51] outstanding women in the entire Bible
[1:21:54] and so much that God would write the
[1:21:57] mystery of the redeemed Gentile bride in
[1:22:00] her life and give her prophecy that she
[1:22:04] would be able to stand and speak future
[1:22:06] events let me stand this morning and
[1:22:09] tell you the world is fixing to be shut
[1:22:11] down I just sent an article this morning
[1:22:14] to several of my preacher friends and
[1:22:16] some of my family that the government is
[1:22:19] saying about the National Geological
[1:22:21] Society and some of those who read the
[1:22:23] earthquakes that the west coast is
[1:22:26] fixing to experience a cataclysmic
[1:22:29] earthquake love they have never
[1:22:30] experienced before they're saying
[1:22:33] thousands if not hundreds of thousands
[1:22:35] will die and they're saying all these
[1:22:38] things I thought yep finally y'all are
[1:22:40] catching up but will you believe it is
[1:22:42] from the word of the Lord no they'll put
[1:22:45] it down well 30 years down the road 40
[1:22:48] years down the road but the title of the
[1:22:50] article was it could be tomorrow
[1:22:53] oh my whatever day it is I want to be
[1:22:57] ready to leave this world
[1:23:00] why because I believe the prophecy I
[1:23:05] believe the prophecy of a virtuous woman
[1:23:11] the bride
[1:23:13] of Christ
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:22] the heart
[1:23:24] of her husband
[1:23:26] death safely trust in her
[1:23:30] so that he
[1:23:31] shall have no need
[1:23:34] of spoil
[1:23:39] you see a man who choose a woman like
[1:23:41] this
[1:23:42] and the spring of their life
[1:23:47] will be able to have such great joy for
[1:23:50] years and years
[1:23:52] as the Snows
[1:23:54] of old age catch up with you
[1:23:59] so young men those of you that are
[1:24:01] looking you're in the spring of your
[1:24:03] life

[1:24:08] that can Crown you
[1:24:11] find one
[1:24:12] that whenever you've reached past your
[1:24:14] 20s and your 30s and your 40s
[1:24:18] and she starts losing a little bit of
[1:24:20] her physique and her figure
[1:24:23] and don't worry you will do
[1:24:33] should I go on
[1:24:37] oh it's nice if you can find a pretty
[1:24:39] woman if I'm Woman character there's
[1:24:40] nothing wrong with that at all but
[1:24:42] remember she will lose that beauty in
[1:24:45] time
[1:24:46] these are always so handsome oh he oh
[1:24:50] look at him oh she's so beautiful
[1:24:53] look at her in 40 years
[1:24:56] she'll still be beautiful if you're
[1:24:58] looking at her through the right eyes
[1:25:00] but after a couple of babies stretch
[1:25:03] marks
[1:25:04] and this and that oh my sister oh
[1:25:06] brother don't tell people I've got them

[1:25:10] babies you've got them
[1:25:13] and then you got crow's feet and then
[1:25:15] them crow's feet turned into dinosaurs
[1:25:17] feet they get bigger and bigger

[1:25:33] E and eat this and drink that and take
[1:25:35] this and take that why you don't want to
[1:25:37] get old
[1:25:39] and the truth of it is us man don't
[1:25:41] either
[1:25:42] I look at myself as a 66 year old man
[1:25:44] and I think this can't be possible
[1:25:47] it don't seem like it's been no time the
[1:25:50] main character were 16.
[1:25:52] and turned 17 the next day after we got
[1:25:54] married and he was saying is that
[1:25:56] possible almost 50 years
[1:25:59] our daughters standing here today our
[1:26:02] oldest daughter I won't say how old she
[1:26:04] is
[1:26:06] her was twin daughters you look at your
[1:26:09] life you say where's it gone a few more
[1:26:12] settings of the sun it'll all be gone
[1:26:14] before us friends
[1:26:16] oh
[1:26:18] I'm so glad the Lord God helped me
[1:26:21] not because I knew what to look for in a
[1:26:24] wife I wasn't raised in church
[1:26:27] I didn't know what to look for in a wife
[1:26:30] but one day I saw this pretty little
[1:26:32] girl
[1:26:33] that come to my uncle's Church she said
[1:26:35] she saw me when I was 12.
[1:26:38] she visited the church and I was up on
[1:26:40] the platform playing the guitar playing
[1:26:42] a red guitar and she saw me thinking
[1:26:45] and then she come to church with her
[1:26:47] cousins
[1:26:48] and I saw her oh my goodness I started
[1:26:52] feeling funny in my stomach
[1:26:55] I started feeling fun in my heart I know
[1:26:57] it wasn't acid reflux
[1:27:05] I look back and I realized
[1:27:07] it was the grace of God
[1:27:09] I had no teaching on what to look for in
[1:27:11] a wife
[1:27:13] I didn't know what to ask for in a wife
[1:27:16] but the Lord God knew
[1:27:19] a Carol and I were very strange some of
[1:27:21] y'all think we're sorry suddenly you're
[1:27:23] not in your head so we got married that
[1:27:26] morning
[1:27:27] and the Methodist parsonage
[1:27:29] because my uncle couldn't marry people
[1:27:32] so we got married that morning and we
[1:27:34] did something very strange
[1:27:37] we went to church that night
[1:27:42] yeah
[1:27:44] we went to church I got up on the guitar
[1:27:46] or played My Little Guitar and sung
[1:27:49] closing into the service
[1:27:52] of God come down and my uncle started
[1:27:54] speaking in tongues
[1:27:56] interpreting
[1:27:57] yea how the Lord God say
[1:28:00] laying hands on me wanting to pray for
[1:28:03] us
[1:28:04] I called her for you before the
[1:28:06] foundation of the world
[1:28:08] ordained you to be together
[1:28:10] predestinated use all these great words
[1:28:12] which they didn't even believe in
[1:28:19] as a matter of fact as far as my memory
[1:28:20] can go back the first time I ever
[1:28:22] remember the word ordained being used
[1:28:25] this is when the Lord said he ordained
[1:28:27] me and Carol to be together
[1:28:29] so ordination has two very special
[1:28:32] things to me I was ordained to be part
[1:28:35] of him
[1:28:36] an ordained to be part with her
[1:28:39] how I thank God for a wonderful Crown my
[1:28:42] goodness as I come preaching my funeral
[1:28:43] I'm fixing to die
[1:28:49] or children
[1:28:52] can't you see what you mean to him
[1:28:54] can't you see what you mean to him
[1:28:56] through this story this morning
[1:29:00] he's longed for you
[1:29:02] before the world began
[1:29:05] you sent you long for him that's only
[1:29:07] part of the story
[1:29:08] he's long for you to be gathered around
[1:29:10] his throne
[1:29:12] where he could receive his crown
[1:29:14] I don't know the one in his head
[1:29:17] the one in his heart
[1:29:20] don't you want to give him what he wants
[1:29:23] how blessed we are
[1:29:26] we're not called to be servants
[1:29:28] we're not called to be the church
[1:29:31] called to be his crown
[1:29:34] this crown
[1:29:37] let him take your pain your anxiety your
[1:29:40] scars let him take all that
[1:29:43] let him have it Bathsheba
[1:29:46] let him make a voice out of you
[1:29:49] did amazing that Solomon quotes the
[1:29:52] voice of his mother
[1:29:54] more so than the voice of his father
[1:29:57] the great psalmist of Israel
[1:30:03] the spirits together
[1:30:07] sisters I don't mean to add to your load
[1:30:10] and your responsibility
[1:30:12] but what a great impact
[1:30:14] you all can have
[1:30:16] and prayerfully continue to have
[1:30:19] on the lives of your children
[1:30:22] you children here today that have a
[1:30:24] mother like this you ought to be so
[1:30:26] happy
[1:30:27] so grateful
[1:30:30] I went to God my mama was still alive
[1:30:34] so I could walk out of this room here
[1:30:35] and pick up the phone and call her
[1:30:37] Mama how are you today
[1:30:41] I ain't been able to do that for a long
[1:30:42] time
[1:30:43] I envy those of you who can
[1:30:47] every now and then me and Carol will be
[1:30:49] out somewhere and she'd say
[1:30:51] when your mama loved to be here mama was
[1:30:54] just a simple person never had a lot of
[1:30:56] stuff in life
[1:30:58] and I'd say yeah she would we were
[1:30:59] someplace not long ago and she said oh
[1:31:01] your mama would love to be here
[1:31:04] and it's it's sad
[1:31:06] because we're taken from us
[1:31:09] but I'm grateful
[1:31:11] of what mama was able to give me
[1:31:13] but oh how grateful I am today
[1:31:17] for what the forefathers running before
[1:31:19] us
[1:31:20] handing down to us where will we be
[1:31:22] today were it not for Luther Wesley
[1:31:25] Pentecost Elijah Peter James John Paul
[1:31:30] where would we be today just a bunch of
[1:31:33] Americans just a bunch of church members
[1:31:36] but what are we rehearsing the prophecy
[1:31:39] we learned from our mother
[1:31:43] Hallelujah
[1:31:46] Lord God I pray
[1:31:49] he'll be able to take this simple
[1:31:50] thought today Father
[1:31:53] oh Jesus may it anchor deep into our
[1:31:56] hearts
[1:31:59] I want to say thank you for my mama
[1:32:03] just because she's gone don't mean I've
[1:32:05] stopped loving her
[1:32:08] I'll think about her from time to time
[1:32:11] bless her heart
[1:32:13] we're so poor and Daddy just
[1:32:15] barely made a wage to survive for us and
[1:32:18] Mama with
[1:32:19] try to stretch the food and make it go
[1:32:21] as far as she could
[1:32:24] I didn't understand it then as a little
[1:32:26] boy but
[1:32:27] as I remember back
[1:32:30] my mama wouldn't eat sometimes
[1:32:35] said she wasn't hungry
[1:32:39] but I realized now what Mama wouldn't
[1:32:41] eat
[1:32:43] that wasn't enough to go around
[1:32:47] dear Lord I think about our
[1:32:50] Church fathers our Patriarchs our
[1:32:52] matriarchs dear mothers saints of God
[1:32:55] that have lived down Through the Ages
[1:32:57] what would we be today
[1:33:00] if it wasn't for those that emblazed the
[1:33:02] trail before us
[1:33:05] and then so much that your Prophet said
[1:33:07] behind every good man is that good woman
[1:33:13] we want to give our sisters that which
[1:33:15] they
[1:33:17] respectfully deserve
[1:33:20] in Christ Jesus
[1:33:22] not the women's Liberation movement
[1:33:25] but the movement of God
[1:33:27] today we honor our sisters and our
[1:33:31] assembly
[1:33:32] that are Godly virtuous women
[1:33:35] not only those that are living but many
[1:33:37] standing here today and no doubt they're
[1:33:38] reminiscing about their mother their
[1:33:41] Godly mother and what she did the things
[1:33:43] she set before the
[1:33:46] oh what a day it'll be father when we
[1:33:48] all gather together
[1:33:50] now we'll walk the queen your wife
[1:33:54] and we will Crown you king of kings and
[1:33:57] Lord of lords
[1:33:59] and then we will take our crowns
[1:34:02] that cast them at your feet
[1:34:06] I've often wondered what you would say
[1:34:09] what would be your first remarks
[1:34:12] of course there's no way for us to know
[1:34:16] and I wonder if the words of Solomon
[1:34:19] have not run true in your heart for it
[1:34:21] was you that gave them
[1:34:22] words to him
[1:34:24] who can find
[1:34:26] a virtuous woman
[1:34:30] it seemed nearly impossible
[1:34:33] for Satan contaminated the entire human
[1:34:36] race
[1:34:38] but we're so grateful the sovereignty of
[1:34:40] God overrodes Satan's contamination
[1:34:46] you can ask the question
[1:34:48] and you can answer your own question who
[1:34:51] can find a virtuous woman
[1:34:54] and you can answer and say
[1:34:57] I the Lord God
[1:34:59] have created one
[1:35:02] praise the Lord
[1:35:04] maybe be true Lord Jesus
[1:35:07] may we be faithful
[1:35:10] may we be your virtuous bride
[1:35:15] may we be able to Crown you one day
[1:35:17] father
[1:35:19] thank you Lord
[1:35:24] how many of you both men and women here
[1:35:26] today
[1:35:27] visible and invisible
[1:35:30] is that your heart's desire
[1:35:33] you don't want to be a church member you
[1:35:34] don't want to be just somebody that
[1:35:36] comes to church and occupies a Pew and
[1:35:39] causes trouble and this and that but
[1:35:41] with all of your heart you want to be
[1:35:43] that type of a person
[1:35:46] wouldn't it be awesome to know that the
[1:35:48] Lord Jesus would say this about you
[1:35:51] that you are a virtuous member of my
[1:35:54] body
[1:35:55] or you wait till we get on down into
[1:35:57] these verses on and on and on Solomon
[1:36:00] goes about his mother
[1:36:02] and about the bride
[1:36:04] of what she is and how she does and what
[1:36:07] she takes what she has and she's like a
[1:36:10] merchant ship and and she spins and she
[1:36:13] weaves and she gets flax and she gets
[1:36:16] business which is linen and she gets all
[1:36:18] of these things
[1:36:20] and it's not that she's so much
[1:36:21] concerned about things
[1:36:23] because all the things she's getting
[1:36:26] are focused back on her husband and her
[1:36:29] children
[1:36:31] oh man this materialistic age when
[1:36:34] things mean more to women than
[1:36:36] motherhood
[1:36:38] they'd rather have a dog or a cat in
[1:36:40] their lap than they would a baby
[1:36:42] they'll abort a baby
[1:36:44] and get a dog or a cat or something else
[1:36:46] to replace it
[1:36:49] well the church is doing the same thing
[1:36:50] and I'm gonna go ahead and say it some
[1:36:52] of these message people don't want any
[1:36:54] of these acts 2 38 tongue talking
[1:36:56] speaking Youngs so you know what they do
[1:36:59] they perform spiritual abortions too
[1:37:02] and they just go ahead and say well we
[1:37:04] don't need all that emotion and the
[1:37:06] message who gave you the right to take
[1:37:08] it away from the bride of Christ
[1:37:11] a prophet said a birth is a mess whether
[1:37:13] it's in a pink decorated hospital room
[1:37:16] or a barn
[1:37:17] and when we get to the place that we
[1:37:19] replace a messy burst we better come
[1:37:21] back and get the Holy Ghost
[1:37:24] oh my so what are some of the message
[1:37:27] preachers doing aborting them by just
[1:37:30] giving them intellectual conception of a
[1:37:33] new birth and call it stillborn yeah
[1:37:38] shame on us
[1:37:40] vote me out if you want to
[1:37:42] don't never let me preach in that new
[1:37:44] place that's up to you but as long as
[1:37:47] I'm here I'm going to preach to you a
[1:37:48] new birth
[1:37:49] the same New Birth Paul had
[1:37:52] the same New Birth Peter had
[1:37:59] elujah
[1:38:02] Oh Glory to God
[1:38:04] now let me just ask you as an individual
[1:38:07] those of you you want to be what you've
[1:38:09] heard preached you want to be a part of
[1:38:12] this bride
[1:38:13] but you just raise your hand to the Lord
[1:38:15] man women I know sometimes the women can
[1:38:17] relate to being part of the Bride easier
[1:38:19] than this man can but we want to be a
[1:38:21] part of that body do we not
[1:38:23] to a weakened Crown the Lord Jesus
[1:38:27] you hear a lot of people talking about
[1:38:28] their Crown oh my crown this and my
[1:38:30] crown that forget our crown let's forget
[1:38:33] that part of it let's think about we're
