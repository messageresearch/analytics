[28:05] there was no intercessor therefore his
[28:08] arm brought salvation unto him and his
[28:11] righteousness it sustained him for he
[28:14] put on righteousness as a breastplate
[28:16] and a helmet of salvation upon his head
[28:19] and he put on the garments of vengeance
[28:23] for clothing and was clad with Zil as a
[28:26] cloak sounds like someone's going to war
[28:31] according to their deeds accordingly he
[28:33] will reap a fury to his adversaries
[28:35] recompense to his enemies to the islands
[28:38] he will repay recompense so shall they
[28:41] fear the name of the Lord from the West
[28:44] and his glory from the rising of the Sun
[28:47] when the enemy shall come in like a
[28:50] flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift
[28:53] up a standard against him Lord Jesus
[28:57] were so grateful Lord here tonight for
[29:01] your word Lord that we can have a sure
[29:03] footing Lord in an age that's trembling
[29:06] and shaking a world that's trembling and
[29:09] and darkness Lord a world that's in fear
[29:12] of war a world that's in fear of the
[29:15] economy and stressed and pressured Lord

[29:23] that word is Shalom it is well be it

[29:44] these things Lord you've put upon my
[29:46] heart but God may it be more than just
[29:48] Lord a word that's passed from intellect
[29:51] to intellect but Lord let that word sow
[29:54] into the very souls and the hearts of
[29:56] your children tonight may you receive
[29:58] the glory Lord I pray in all things be
[30:01] with us we invite you now in Jesus name
[30:04] amen you can be seated this word that we
[30:12] come to standard that the scripture
[30:15] speaking of here in Isaiah and it says
[30:17] that the Lord shall raise up when the
[30:20] enemy comes rushing in like a flood the
[30:22] Spirit of God will raise up a standard
[30:25] against him this word standard is is
[30:29] such an important word in the age that
[30:31] we live in more than ever before because
[30:34] we're living in the age not of seed but
[30:37] you're living in the age of the maturing
[30:40] of that seed there was an there was a
[30:42] time even in this lady I see an age
[30:44] where things were in seed form in an
[30:47] infant stage but you're not living in
[30:49] that infant stage but we're actually
[30:52] right at the the culmination and the
[30:55] manifestation of all fruits and all
[30:58] seeds where the Bible says all seeds
[31:01] would come to maturity would come to
[31:03] fruition so we're living at the zenith
[31:06] or the precipice of God's kingdom and
[31:09] Satan's Kingdom we're living at the very
[31:12] precipice or the climax of God's purpose
[31:15] and Satan's purpose and you're living in
[31:19] an age where everything is claiming to
[31:22] be right we
[31:23] take this word standard and and here's
[31:26] what we know about the word of God and
[31:28] all the voices in the world there's only
[31:30] one standard that God has God does not
[31:33] have many standards he does not have
[31:35] many choices or ways that are right but
[31:39] what we know is that not everything that
[31:41] says it's right is actually right though
[31:44] there's there's different religions in
[31:46] the world that claim to have the right
[31:48] way and there's different people who
[31:50] have different approaches to that right
[31:52] way you have a world filled with
[31:55] denominations and denominational ideas
[31:57] and the opinions of men and what were
[32:00] ripe with in the age that we live in is
[32:02] the opinions of people oh boy
[32:05] opinions are just endless in the age we
[32:08] live in
[32:08] you can google there they do and what
[32:10] you're getting well from your google
[32:12] search result over a topic that you
[32:14] might google is different opinions from
[32:16] different intellectual minds or
[32:18] different camps of thinking or people
[32:20] with different ideas and the world is
[32:23] littered with opinions of people but
[32:27] there's only one opinion that matters
[32:29] and that's the opinion of the word
[32:31] there's not more than one right way as
[32:35] we live in a world that's so sympathetic
[32:37] to every opinion and so sympathetic to
[32:41] every moral and every idea and what
[32:44] people say is morality and it's based
[32:47] upon your opinion or how you were raised
[32:49] or the country you were born in but
[32:52] here's what we know there's only one
[32:53] right way out of all the voices that say
[32:56] they have the truth there's only one
[32:58] truth out of all the opinions that say
[33:01] they know what what God is there's only
[33:03] one God and he's not multiple ways he's
[33:07] only one way there's not more than one
[33:10] truth there's only one truth there's not
[33:13] more than one baptism there's only one
[33:15] baptism there's not more than one right
[33:19] way there's only one right way
[33:24] and we're living in a world to where
[33:27] everyone is trying to measure their own
[33:29] standard or use their own measuring line
[33:32] to to measure what morality is or what
[33:34] is right and what is wrong everyone has
[33:37] their own standard of how you should
[33:40] live or standard of how you should dress
[33:42] or standard of what a church is or
[33:44] standard of what a Christian is but
[33:47] there's only one standard and it can't
[33:50] be what the world is thinking you can't
[33:52] you say what is the measuring line I
[33:54] want to read you a quote here from
[33:56] brother Branham and this is this is just
[33:58] I believe just brings emphasis and the
[34:00] brothers have those quotes in scriptures
[34:02] if you want to display them brother
[34:04] Branham says out of the message the
[34:06] trial he says God must bring judgment
[34:09] upon the earth and God has to have
[34:12] something here a standard to judge the
[34:15] world by because it would be unjust in
[34:18] God to judge the world and the world
[34:21] knowing no standard to go by how many
[34:25] believes that's true the church is the
[34:28] standard which one is it the word God
[34:32] said he would judge the world by Jesus
[34:35] Christ he says in another place in the
[34:38] harvest time he says but he's going to
[34:40] judge the world and he's got to have
[34:42] some standard to judge by or he would be
[34:46] unjust to let us go now and live this
[34:49] life without a standard or to be judged
[34:51] who would be right where could you tell
[34:54] what was right there has to be a
[34:56] standard and everyone has their own
[34:59] standard every Church has their own
[35:01] standard the world has their own
[35:03] standard of what truth is they have
[35:06] their own standard of their own approach
[35:07] and you say should we use the world
[35:09] hardly so the world is ever-changing
[35:12] but the world is constantly modifying
[35:16] what they believe that there's no
[35:18] foundation anywhere on the world of what
[35:20] they believed about just 40 years ago
[35:23] and what they used to call wrong they
[35:25] now call right what they used to call
[35:27] right they now call wrong and
[35:30] old-fashioned and out of sink or out of
[35:32] touch with the common though
[35:34] the world that we live in today the
[35:36] world their standard of the world is
[35:38] constantly changing from one age to the
[35:41] next age they have no absolute the world
[35:45] has no type post and one day though the
[35:48] political view is one man then the next
[35:50] year it's a different political view and
[35:52] this politician share voted for this and
[35:55] and five years later they voted against
[35:57] it and a new interview and say well what
[35:59] change well you notice became more
[36:01] progressive in my thinking and I used to
[36:04] be under a different teaching or a
[36:06] different school of thought and and now
[36:08] I've modified what is it it's a
[36:10] different standard the world standard is
[36:12] constantly changing and let me say it's
[36:15] not just changing it's decaying its
[36:18] corrupting it's declining world's not
[36:24] getting better the world is getting
[36:25] worse so you can't use the world by a
[36:29] measuring line you say well then which
[36:31] one should we use the church hardly the
[36:34] church over the last hundred years has
[36:36] changed their standard the prophet of
[36:39] God said if you're going to use the
[36:40] church than what church should you use
[36:42] everyone reads the same Bible yet they
[36:45] come up with a different standard
[36:47] everyone reads the same history of the
[36:49] church and they come away with a
[36:51] different opinion about what the church
[36:53] is what the church was what the church
[36:55] should be doing what the church should
[36:57] be today the church is constantly
[37:01] denominational systems and religion it's
[37:04] constantly changing its standard its
[37:07] ever-changing the measuring line and you
[37:12] watch even just in religious circles and
[37:14] men who have stood for truth even just
[37:16] basic biblical truth and you take a man
[37:19] like TD jakes
[37:21] who for years was Pentecostal oneness
[37:23] and denounced the Trinity and and get it
[37:26] and believed in the oneness of God and
[37:28] then for years he had his ministry there
[37:30] and and a nanny told that but but this
[37:33] years later he was questioned on him and
[37:36] he was asked what do you believe and he
[37:38] was he was confronted on him what
[37:39] happened to TD jakes his ministry got
[37:42] larger and it got larger popularity
[37:45] became gray
[37:46] her pressure became greater and he caves
[37:49] into the pressure denounces the oneness
[37:51] and accepts the Trinity you say what was
[37:55] it his standard changed because his
[37:59] standard was the church his standard was
[38:03] what men said his standard is what
[38:05] opinion said his standard and this is
[38:07] what the liz is the condition that the
[38:09] world is in there's a constantly
[38:12] evolving standard that is changing
[38:15] constantly
[38:16] the church has watered the truth down
[38:20] that they have versions of the Bible
[38:22] even even the NIV of popularly read
[38:25] version not getting into translations I
[38:27] read from many different translations
[38:29] but you got to be careful in those
[38:31] translations even in the NIV to are just
[38:35] just multiple entire verses entire
[38:40] verses and the new in that in the book
[38:41] of Mark have been removed you go read
[38:45] the NIV and look at they I think it's in
[38:47] the in the book of Mark and it comes to
[38:48] you read verse 9 and verse 10 and
[38:50] there's a verse and verse 11 and there's
[38:52] a verse verse 12 there's verse verse 13
[38:55] this has a number there's no words it
[38:57] just goes straight to verse 14 what is
[39:00] it it's an ever-changing world and an
[39:04] ever-changing standard and you're living
[39:09] in an age where now the standard has
[39:11] been loosed from morals of history now
[39:14] we don't take history of the church
[39:16] anymore but now people are literally
[39:19] creating their own standard their own
[39:22] view or their own opinion we're living
[39:25] in the age where the mind of man has
[39:27] been exalted to where the very thoughts
[39:30] of a human being are worshiped above
[39:33] what the Word of God says the book of
[39:38] Judges Judges chapter 21 verse 25 Judges
[39:42] speaks of a horrible time and then then
[39:45] those days of Israel notice what one
[39:47] verse says it says in those days there
[39:49] was no king in Israel and every man did
[39:53] that which was right in his own eyes
[39:58] because there was no king God had to
[40:01] send judges because people literally
[40:04] just live lives as they felt to live it
[40:07] everyone was right in their own eyes man
[40:10] became his own interpreter man becomes
[40:16] his own filter he doesn't have a tight
[40:21] post to go back to he doesn't have a
[40:23] footing the staff foundation to go to he
[40:26] doesn't have a word to go to you say
[40:27] well what what makes up your standards
[40:30] what makes up what you believe what
[40:32] makes up what what makes you what's
[40:34] right and what's wrong my brother and
[40:36] sister when you reject the word and you
[40:39] leave the standard that God gives you'll
[40:41] eventually leave this you'll go to this
[40:43] man and you'll follow his opinion and
[40:45] then you go to this preacher and this
[40:47] this but the Aegean you believe his
[40:49] opinion and then when you find an
[40:51] opinion you like better you go to his
[40:53] opinion and you're constantly evolving
[40:55] oh my brother that when you leave this
[40:58] word it's an ever plunging pit it's a
[41:01] bottomless pit of men's thinking and
[41:05] man's ideas until eventually you just
[41:08] believe what you want to believe and you
[41:12] live you say how are you living by
[41:14] what's right in my own eyes you become
[41:18] your own interpreter you become your own
[41:20] moral compass you become your own
[41:22] thinker now I know that different
[41:26] standards you take today if we were to
[41:28] poll every single one of you you'd have
[41:30] different standards of what you call a
[41:32] clean house you'd have different
[41:34] standards all of us would vary what a
[41:35] clean car is we'd all have different
[41:38] opinions of standard of what a good job
[41:40] is or how work should be done our
[41:42] standards are all a little different
[41:44] every single one of us personal
[41:46] standards you go over to another country
[41:49] and you live in another person's home
[41:51] eat their food you realize the standard
[41:53] that you have is not the same standard
[41:55] that they have the standard of
[41:57] cleanliness is different the standard of
[41:59] sanitation is different and you cringe
[42:02] at the thought of going into eating food
[42:04] because what is it your standard is not
[42:07] the same as their standard
[42:10] you were raised differently then maybe
[42:15] the home that you're in you were raised
[42:17] with different standards and everyone
[42:20] has a different opinion but my brother
[42:22] and my sister the reality is there's
[42:25] only one opinion there's only one truth
[42:28] I know this is so simple here tonight
[42:31] but I just want to emphasize it there's
[42:33] only one truth only one only one right
[42:39] way to approach God there's only one
[42:42] right way and God wasn't gonna take
[42:44] multiple choice you look at Cain and you
[42:47] look at Abel God wasn't gonna say well I
[42:49] had said both of you because you're both
[42:51] right in your own way you know Cain that
[42:57] looks good Abel that's actually read the
[42:58] Cain's is not bad either you know I
[43:01] think everyone's right and everyone's a
[43:03] champion everyone's a winner there are
[43:04] no losers we don't keep score at ball
[43:07] games anymore because everyone's a
[43:09] winner don't want to tell anyone but
[43:10] here's the reality there's a loser and
[43:12] there's a winner there's a right way
[43:15] there's a wrong way and God was only
[43:19] going to accept one way one truth one
[43:23] baptism he wasn't going to accept
[43:27] multiple choice there was one right way
[43:31] and today we have millions of ways and
[43:34] millions of opinions but listen to me
[43:37] brother what Christianity is based upon
[43:39] is that we earnestly contend for the
[43:42] faith that was one time delivered to the
[43:46] Saints one time it was delivered right
[43:48] it doesn't need change that doesn't need
[43:51] modified it doesn't need added to it
[43:53] doesn't need taken away from God only
[43:55] says to fin the word that I've sent you
[44:00] hallelujah let me say this you say I
[44:04] think this well what about this and this
[44:05] opinion people love given their opinions
[44:08] what they think but let me let me just
[44:11] give you as straight as I know how God
[44:12] doesn't care what you think
[44:16] I know that hurts our pride but God
[44:18] doesn't care what I think God doesn't
[44:21] care what you think we can give our
[44:24] opinion over something but there's only
[44:26] one word and that word is unchanging God
[44:29] said I'm gonna send a word and it's
[44:32] going to be an unchanging word our time
[44:35] may change the world may change politics
[44:37] may change countries and nations may
[44:39] change but I'm gonna give you a timeless
[44:42] truth I'm gonna give you an ageless word
[44:45] I'm gonna give you a word that was good
[44:48] for Paul and it was good for Silas it
[44:51] was good for Peter and it will be good
[44:53] for you too it'll never change it'll
[44:57] never decay don't never erode it will
[44:59] hold its power it will hold its strength
[45:02] to the endless ages to come it will not
[45:06] be a dynamic word it won't evolve
[45:10] dynamic meaning changing it won't evolve
[45:13] with my opinions or your opinions
[45:17] the word and the standard God says I'm
[45:19] going to give you is it going to matter
[45:21] how dark the age gets doesn't mean the
[45:23] standard changes people want to change
[45:26] the sander of the word because the age
[45:28] is darker and somehow we think that
[45:31] because the age gets darker the standard
[45:33] gets lower no let me give you it's the
[45:36] opposite the light gets brighter as the
[45:39] darkness thickens the light brightens oh
[45:44] my brother the brother Adam says this
[45:46] notice this brother branham says go to
[45:49] the next quote brother he says thus what
[45:51] the church was at Pentecost is the
[45:55] standard that is the pattern there is no
[46:00] other pattern no matter what scholars
[46:04] say God has not changed that pattern
[46:06] what God did it Pentecost he has to keep
[46:09] on doing until the church ages close he
[46:12] says if a man is born of the word being
[46:15] born again not of corruptible seed what
[46:17] was it it was an unchanging word it was
[46:20] a plumb line that was made to be
[46:22] straight and not to be changed not
[46:25] the attitude not to not to be taken away
[46:28] from not for us to give our opinion and
[46:31] your opinion that word opinions like a
[46:38] buzzword people love to say it well that
[46:41] was brother Brennan's opinion hmm a
[46:49] novel thought brother Brennan's opinion
[46:52] oh brother man we can't preach opinion
[46:54] you know he had certain things with him
[46:55] who's to say what was his opinion what
[46:57] wasn't his opinion what your opinion is
[46:59] in my opinion that was brother branham's
[47:01] opinion and I raised my kids by this
[47:03] opinion in that opinion and it's because
[47:05] I have a different opinion well let me
[47:07] tell you something I'm not here to
[47:10] preach that we should just follow all
[47:12] opinions and follow boy whatever brother
[47:14] ends opinion of is the hunting rifle or
[47:15] a good place to live or whatever it was
[47:18] but when it comes to the Word of God I
[47:20] think I'll take a man who was vindicated
[47:24] by the pillar of fires I think I'll take
[47:26] his opinion over any opinion that I have
[47:31] Alleluia what was gone sending when he
[47:35] sent the word it was a plumb line and
[47:38] that's why it's important that we keep
[47:41] it straight that we don't deviate from
[47:44] it that we don't differ from it but keep
[47:47] the Word of God straight my brother and
[47:50] my sister opinion doesn't bring life
[47:53] opinion doesn't bring the dead back to
[47:55] life the word brings life the word
[47:58] brings the dead back to life the word is
[48:01] the only thing that has power so keep
[48:03] the word straight whether Branham says
[48:07] notice this here he says if a man is
[48:09] born of the word being born again not of
[48:11] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[48:13] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[48:15] forever he will produce the word he will
[48:21] produce the word the fruit or works of
[48:25] his life will be a product of the kind
[48:29] of seed or life that's in him his works
[48:33] therefore will be scriptural because
[48:37] that's the see
[48:38] that's supposed to be planted you say
[48:40] what is the evidence of the holy spell
[48:42] ago say Amen to the Word of God but
[48:44] brother say it amen to the Word of God
[48:46] is not a verbal Eman this is saying Amen
[48:50] to the Word of God when your life
[48:52] produces the word you are saying a man
[48:56] to the word what was Mary's vindication
[49:02] it wasn't that she just said beat unto
[49:04] me but it was when she produced the word
[49:07] in her own life I want to say God let my
[49:11] life produce the fruit of the word in my
[49:14] life not an opinion not a Creed not an
[49:17] idea let my life produce the fruits of
[49:20] the spirit of god hallelujah let it be
[49:25] scriptural let it be a life that's
[49:28] produced by the seed that's in me can
[49:31] you say man here tonight he says there
[49:33] he was the matchless one notice this
[49:36] here he says there he was there he
[49:38] stands the matchless one and in his hand
[49:41] the sharp sword with two edges the Word
[49:44] of God and that word would judge us in
[49:46] the last day in fact that word is
[49:47] judging even now for it is the discerner
[49:50] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[49:53] heart
[49:53] it cuts asunder the carnal from the
[49:56] spiritual it makes us living epistles
[50:00] read and known of all men I want to say
[50:03] God let the word judge my heart here
[50:06] tonight and make me a written epistle
[50:08] read and known of all men he says I know
[50:11] that works if a man fears that he might
[50:14] not please God and let him fulfill the
[50:16] word if a man wonders if he will hear
[50:18] those words well done good and faithful
[50:20] servant I want to hear those words let
[50:23] him fulfill the Word of God in his life
[50:26] in other words don't just let it be a
[50:29] lip service don't just let you don't
[50:30] don't just be a professor Brennan said
[50:33] we have enough professors be a possessor
[50:35] be one who possesses the word that you
[50:38] profess he says the word of truth was
[50:41] the criterion then is the criterion now
[50:43] there isn't
[50:45] another standard there isn't another
[50:49] plumb line as the world is going to be
[50:52] judged by one Christ Jesus even so it is
[50:55] going to be judged by the word if a man
[50:58] wants to know how he's making out let
[51:01] him do his James suggests look into the
[51:03] mirror of God's a word don't compare
[51:07] yourself to your brother or your sister
[51:09] or to this church or to that man or that
[51:12] ministry there's only one mirror there's
[51:15] only one standard and that's the word of
[51:17] the Living God what are we trying to be
[51:21] total in our life sub-2 not any man not
[51:25] any opinion to the word hallelujah let's
[51:30] look at this here this this just the
[51:32] Signet notice here in numbers chapter 1
[51:34] verse 50 turn in your Bible if you have
[51:36] a Bible here tonight
[51:37] numbers chapter 1 verse 50 I want I want
[51:40] to show you something here when the
[51:42] enemy comes rushing in like a flood the
[51:45] Spirit of God raises up a standard
[51:48] against it notice what this standard was
[51:51] in the Bible it says here in numbers
[51:54] chapter 1 verse 50 it says but thou
[51:56] shall appoint the Levites over the
[51:59] tabernacle of the testimony numbers is a
[52:02] book that's going to list it's exactly
[52:05] what it means it's going to number the
[52:07] tribes of Israel the sons of Jacob
[52:09] it says Levites over the tabernacle and
[52:12] over all the vessels thereof and over
[52:13] all the things that belong to it they
[52:15] shall bear the tabernacle and and all
[52:17] the vessels thereof and they shall
[52:19] minister unto it and shall and camp
[52:22] round about the tabernacle and I want
[52:27] you to just Apollo see a brother if you
[52:28] want to put up the slides we have you
[52:30] can bring that up I want you to notice
[52:32] here what this meant when it said
[52:35] encamped around go to slide five if you
[52:37] have them what it meant when he said in
[52:40] camp around the tabernacle we know that
[52:43] Israel was encamped by numbers they were
[52:45] they were they were placed in a specific
[52:49] position this picture gives a perfect
[52:52] portrait of that of where that the Ark
[52:54] of the of the tabernacle the our the the
[52:56] the tabernacle the outer court the
[52:59] holiest of holies was at the center of
[53:01] the camp now notice here and keep
[53:04] reading in your Bible but keep this the
[53:05] slide up it says that they shall in camp
[53:08] round about the tabernacle that was the
[53:11] Levites place they were given to the
[53:14] ministerial duties they were to take
[53:16] care of the tabernacle to make sure the
[53:18] oil didn't go out in the candlestick
[53:20] they were taking care of the ministerial
[53:22] that sacrifices the duties of the priest
[53:25] and he says in verse 51 and when the
[53:27] tabernacle said it forward the Levites
[53:30] shall take it down when the tabernacle
[53:31] is to be pitched the Levites shall set
[53:34] it up and the stranger that cometh not
[53:35] shall be put to death verse 52 and the
[53:39] children of Israel shall pitch their
[53:41] tents notice this the children of Israel
[53:44] shall pitch their tents every man by his
[53:49] own camp and every man by his own
[53:53] standard that's what the scripture says
[53:58] every man shall pitch towards the tent
[54:01] by his own camp and by his own standard
[54:05] throughout their hosts know our numbers
[54:08] the neck very next chapter I'm number
[54:11] numbers chapter 2 verse 2 and every man
[54:15] of the children of Israel shall pitch by
[54:17] his own standard with the in sign of
[54:22] their father's house the in sign the
[54:25] signet the emblem they shall pitch by
[54:30] his own standard with the in sign of
[54:33] their father's house what was the in
[54:36] sign you see Israel was not going to
[54:39] just be dispersed all over the
[54:41] countryside with the tabernacle in the
[54:44] middle but God says there's going to be
[54:46] an order by which you live this isn't
[54:50] going to be just looking like a bunch of
[54:52] homeless people living out in tents and
[54:54] just scattered all across the mountain
[54:55] but God says there's going to be order
[54:58] you're going to be placed in a specific
[55:00] spot and he says each man Levi's nepto
[55:06] lie Benjamin you notice all of the
[55:09] brothers jail
[55:10] all of the sons of Jacob I sure Dan all
[55:13] of them was to have their own encampment
[55:17] and if you were under the sign or the
[55:20] emblem of Dan you camped under that
[55:24] emblem brother Branham says this he says
[55:28] the scripture says he says when that
[55:29] when the Spirit of God raises he says
[55:32] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[55:34] Spirit of God raises a standard against
[55:36] him so when the enemy went out as the
[55:38] Anti Christ God sent a certain type of
[55:40] power out to meet him he says he went
[55:44] out again as a red horse rider another
[55:46] color another power another ministry God
[55:48] sent another one after him to combat it
[55:50] to hold his church what was it it was
[55:53] the spirits from the book for the
[55:55] creatures from the Book of Revelations
[55:58] chapter 4 the throne room of God what do
[56:02] you have around that throne you have
[56:03] four living creatures as revelations for
[56:07] Jarnell me Olive Baptist says I seen he
[56:10] had the face like unto a man and he's
[56:12] seen a creature with the face of a lion
[56:14] he seen a creature with the face of an
[56:17] ox and then he had a creature with the
[56:21] face of an eagle notice these brothers
[56:24] go to slide 1 these were the creatures
[56:27] that John sees and revelations he sees
[56:30] the lion the face of a lion and brother
[56:34] Adam says what was it it was the Spirit
[56:36] of God that God was sending the
[56:39] anointing of God that God was sending to
[56:42] combat the Antichrist spirit so he sees
[56:46] a lion you know Ezekiel sees the very
[56:48] same thing the difference with Ezekiel
[56:52] is and Ezekiel sees a will in the middle
[56:54] of a will he sees a moving sea of moving
[56:57] throne and you'll read the the Book of
[57:00] Ezekiel Ezekiel says he falls in by the
[57:02] river of Chebar and falls in division
[57:04] and he sees the same thing John sees as
[57:07] John's looking in the throne room of God
[57:10] he sees four living creatures this lion
[57:14] the varying go to the next one brother
[57:15] he sees the lion he sees the man this
[57:18] was another anointing keep going he sees
[57:20] the Ox another anointing of Christ
[57:23] and then go to the next and brother then
[57:26] he sees the flying eagle and what were
[57:29] these these were the cygnets or the
[57:32] standards or the emblems that Israel was
[57:36] camping under brother Branham says that
[57:41] he says that is speaking of speaking
[57:43] this he said Dan was under the eagle
[57:46] anointing or Dan was under the eagle
[57:49] signet or the eagle standard so in
[57:52] Israel could keep going brother
[57:54] the very next slide it should be the
[57:55] same one we were at when Dan went when
[57:58] you see when they were camped about I
[58:00] want you to look here in numbers chapter
[58:01] 2 this is this is so amazing the
[58:04] scripture tells us that as Moses sees
[58:07] this images he's caught up into heaven
[58:09] and he sees this image of the house of
[58:12] God and God tells him build a tabernacle
[58:14] build it exactly like you've seen in the
[58:16] throne room
[58:17] not exactly like you've seen in heaven
[58:19] so what does Moses do he builds this
[58:22] tabernacle and then God says beyond that
[58:25] tabernacle I want you to pitch your
[58:27] tents
[58:27] Dan Asher neptulon Ephraim Reuben and
[58:31] all of them are going to have they're
[58:34] going to be called they're going to be
[58:38] placed under a different standard just
[58:44] like in an army today you have the
[58:46] different battalions you take the air
[58:48] force of them and the Marines or the
[58:50] army they all wear a different signet
[58:52] what is it it's a different standard
[58:55] it gives them tells them where they're
[58:58] to be positionally placed to stay in
[59:02] order and so God says Moses I want you
[59:06] to tell them and numbers two he says
[59:08] tell them to camp based on the in sign
[59:12] of their father's house
[59:15] so Judah the camp of Judah is going to
[59:18] consist of 74,000 people 84 it said of
[59:25] 74,000 under Judah under it's a car
[59:29] there's going to be 84 thousand people
[59:32] Zebulon is going to have fifty seven
[59:35] thousand four hundred people
[59:37] a total of 186 thousand men that worded
[59:42] that we're going to be camped to the
[59:43] east and all of them were to be under
[59:49] their standard under their cygnet what
[59:55] was this sand earn what was this signet
[59:57] Judah goes out first
[59:59] and guess what Judas signet is you could
[1:00:02] imagine a lion because the lion of the
[1:00:07] tribe of Judah he comes out of Jesus
[1:00:10] comes out of Judah of that tribe of
[1:00:13] Judah now notice Judas goes first he's
[1:00:16] going to be he's going to be under the
[1:00:18] standard of the lion and under Judah
[1:00:21] under that same standard is going to be
[1:00:24] is a card set belong who would come in
[1:00:26] behind Judah but under the same standard
[1:00:29] of a lion they were all camped under
[1:00:33] that emblem of a lion God does
[1:00:37] everything perfect no mistakes
[1:00:40] John sees creatures lion ox man eagle
[1:00:44] Ezekiel sees creatures lion ox man Eagle
[1:00:47] what are they their defenders their
[1:00:50] guards of the throne they're the
[1:00:53] guardians of the throne room I wish so
[1:00:57] bad we had time to preach on this
[1:00:59] tonight and we don't but they notice a
[1:01:01] need and when God drives out the man
[1:01:03] what is he placed in front of Eden
[1:01:05] cherubims with the flaming sword that
[1:01:09] went every way you remember that in the
[1:01:13] Bible that turned every way north south
[1:01:17] east west
[1:01:18] what were those cherubims doing they
[1:01:20] were guarding Eden Eden wasn't a place a
[1:01:24] geographical location that they were
[1:01:26] guarding they were guarding a condition
[1:01:28] that man fell from they were guarding an
[1:01:31] atmosphere that Adam had lost and now
[1:01:34] man is driven from Adams position and
[1:01:37] now there's cherubims guarding Guardians
[1:01:41] Ezekiel sees those same guardians to the
[1:01:44] throne room of God Ezekiel sees them the
[1:01:47] man that the Eagle the ox the
[1:01:50] and what is what is George ancien
[1:01:52] revelation when he says behold I've seen
[1:01:54] a throne and he says and surrounded the
[1:01:57] throne twenty-four elders what words the
[1:01:59] patriarchs and the disciples it was it
[1:02:02] was all in type of guardians what is
[1:02:05] Matthew Mark Luke and John guards of the
[1:02:10] throne of God and brother Branham said
[1:02:12] they all had a different anointing one
[1:02:14] was under the eagle one was under the
[1:02:16] Aswan was under the man what was it it
[1:02:18] was all God's Guardians defending the
[1:02:23] way back to Eden that's why you don't
[1:02:28] find the formula for South firfer the
[1:02:30] new birth in Matthew Mark Luke or John
[1:02:32] you find it in acts because they were
[1:02:37] guarding the way I don't want to lose
[1:02:39] that lose you in my thought here tonight
[1:02:41] but they were guarding the way so now
[1:02:43] what do you have you have Israel who's
[1:02:47] the only possessor of truth out of all
[1:02:51] the nations of the entire earth God does
[1:02:53] not say I'm going to choose Israel and
[1:02:55] I'm gonna choose the hittite and I'm
[1:02:57] gonna choose the the Egyptians and I'm
[1:02:59] gonna choose the Romans all right I am I
[1:03:01] gonna choose the pit the the the the
[1:03:04] hittites and the perizzites I'm gonna
[1:03:06] use the Canaanites and but I'm gonna use
[1:03:08] Israel too and I'm gonna have everyone's
[1:03:10] gonna have truth
[1:03:11] everyone's gonna be everyone's gonna be
[1:03:14] the ambassador of God no he chooses one
[1:03:16] little nation one elected family to be
[1:03:21] the ambassador of the truth to the
[1:03:24] entire world
[1:03:28] and what has God done in this age he's
[1:03:32] chosen one the little elected family of
[1:03:36] God and what are you you're the
[1:03:38] ambassador of truth to the entire world
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:45] he doesn't give the Canaanites the
[1:03:47] standard he gives it to Israel only
[1:03:52] Israel has the standard
[1:03:57] and they're all camped out under these
[1:04:02] this is how they're to Marxist is out
[1:04:03] there to in camp let's go a little bit
[1:04:06] further Rubin camps under the man the
[1:04:09] five what was that standard it was a
[1:04:11] flag it was a flagpole that they carried
[1:04:14] and under that flag if you were to see
[1:04:16] Israel's encampment in that day you
[1:04:19] would see those four flags you would see
[1:04:21] one camped under the lion and end under
[1:04:24] that campement under that under that
[1:04:26] flag under that banner would be Judah
[1:04:29] it's a car Zebulon and all of their
[1:04:31] families camped under that lion standard
[1:04:35] and then if you look to them to the west
[1:04:37] if you look to the west you'd see Reuben
[1:04:40] and under helm above his flag and the
[1:04:43] carriers of the flag you would see the
[1:04:45] face of a man and Reuben gathers under
[1:04:51] that flag noticed this the camp of
[1:04:54] Reuben has for forty six thousand five
[1:04:57] hundred people in it a lot of people and
[1:05:01] underneath Reuben under the same Cygnus
[1:05:04] Simeon with fifty nine thousand three
[1:05:07] hundred people and then GAD follows
[1:05:10] under the same banner the same standard
[1:05:13] the same anointing the same flag the
[1:05:17] same spirit GAD falls under the same
[1:05:20] with forty five thousand people a total
[1:05:24] camped under the man standard of one
[1:05:27] hundred and fifty one thousand four
[1:05:30] hundred and fifty men camped to the
[1:05:33] South Moses didn't make this up they
[1:05:39] surely didn't make this up you see
[1:05:41] people don't come under order
[1:05:43] automatically but actually your human
[1:05:47] nature automatically is in disorder you
[1:05:53] are not ordered by anything except
[1:05:55] someone making you discipline to bring
[1:05:57] order to your life let me say this my
[1:06:00] brother and my sister order does not
[1:06:02] come for the opinions of man order comes
[1:06:05] by the Word of God bringing order to
[1:06:08] your life
[1:06:10] you won't order in your home apply the
[1:06:12] Word of God to your home you will order
[1:06:15] in your family apply the word it brings
[1:06:18] order to your house
[1:06:21] people don't like order but God wants
[1:06:26] order
[1:06:27] God says Ezra you're going to camp this
[1:06:29] way and now notice this is this as you
[1:06:32] look under Reuben as he's camped under
[1:06:35] that signet and now you have Simeon and
[1:06:38] GAD under that same flag of a man then
[1:06:41] you have Levi who was Levi part of the
[1:06:44] ministry chosen by God the priesthood
[1:06:47] and where did they live in the middle at
[1:06:50] the Tabernacle that's where they camped
[1:06:54] they lived constantly for the needs of
[1:06:58] the people that's what a true minister
[1:07:02] is a true priest a true minister is not
[1:07:06] a sage on the stage whose elite and
[1:07:09] doesn't have time for anybody a true
[1:07:11] servant of God a true minister of God
[1:07:14] cares for the affairs of the people but
[1:07:19] what do you have in this age you have
[1:07:20] kingdom builders and men who wear crowns
[1:07:22] like kings and they got time for nobody
[1:07:26] and you got to come to their revelation
[1:07:28] you got to come to their church pay your
[1:07:29] tithes to them God never called those
[1:07:32] men God is calling servants of the king
[1:07:35] the almighty King the only King we have
[1:07:41] hallelujah notice under Ephraim Ephraim
[1:07:48] is going to receive the ox standard the
[1:07:52] standard of the Oxus flag after all of
[1:07:55] all all of his olivey friends people and
[1:07:58] Manasseh is going to be under that same
[1:08:00] exact standard Ephraim is going to
[1:08:03] consist of forty thousand five hundred
[1:08:05] people and Manasseh is going to be under
[1:08:08] that same standard with thirty two
[1:08:11] thousand two hundred people and Benjamin
[1:08:14] also will fall under that ox flag
[1:08:17] Benjamin will have thirty five thousand
[1:08:20] four hundred people totaling one
[1:08:22] Durotan 8100 men
[1:08:26] camped to the west you go further than
[1:08:30] that and what do you have you go further
[1:08:32] than that and you have Dan Dan's
[1:08:34] anointing his flag it's going to be the
[1:08:37] picture of a flying eagle and Dan's
[1:08:41] going to be under that anointing of an
[1:08:43] eagle dan is going to hat on under Dan
[1:08:46] he's going to have sixty two thousand
[1:08:49] seven hundred people
[1:08:51] Asher's going to fall under that same
[1:08:53] standard he's going to live under that
[1:08:55] same banner Asher is gonna have forty
[1:08:58] one thousand five hundred people and
[1:09:00] nepto lie is going to live under that
[1:09:02] same eagle standard depth Allah is going
[1:09:05] to have fifty three thousand four
[1:09:07] hundred people a total under the eagle
[1:09:10] anointing of one hundred and fifty-seven
[1:09:13] thousand six hundred men who are camped
[1:09:16] to the north you see for the map where
[1:09:20] did you get these numbers numbers that's
[1:09:22] why the books called numbers you say
[1:09:25] wise numbers important why did why did
[1:09:27] God fake it important because every name
[1:09:30] who is going to be called under that
[1:09:33] anointing God was going to have a
[1:09:35] specific name a specific person a
[1:09:38] specific army oh my brother God's family
[1:09:41] is not general and just generally
[1:09:44] speaking but he knows exactly how many
[1:09:46] people are in his army he has the
[1:09:49] elected numbered my brother and my
[1:09:52] sister you say I'm part of the elected
[1:09:55] family of God because God specifically
[1:09:59] chose you oh that ought to do something
[1:10:06] to your heart here tonight then no God
[1:10:08] God didn't to start picks that group God
[1:10:11] didn't look at a group of a hundred two
[1:10:13] hundred thousand whatever it is people
[1:10:14] and say I choose all the y'all but God
[1:10:17] by person-to-person chose specifically
[1:10:21] every individual who would have a seat
[1:10:25] at the throne room of God and I believe
[1:10:28] my name is in that has a seat at that
[1:10:30] table much
[1:10:31] children have a seat at that table my
[1:10:33] family have a seat at that table there
[1:10:38] won't be one empty chair because there
[1:10:42] won't be one extra seat at that marriage
[1:10:48] table that marriage table has exact
[1:10:52] number
[1:10:53] we don't know what that number is none
[1:10:56] of us know how many are thee and me and
[1:10:58] the elected family of God I know how
[1:11:01] many God says there's going to be some
[1:11:02] who live under the anointing of them of
[1:11:05] the lion there's going to be paul and
[1:11:07] silas and peter and that first age and
[1:11:09] god had a very specific number for the
[1:11:12] Ephesian age and when that final number
[1:11:15] came in what happened that age goes and
[1:11:18] the next age comes God knew exactly how
[1:11:21] many would come under the Ox anointing
[1:11:24] and have to give their lives as martyrs
[1:11:25] he knew the exact number of elected
[1:11:28] people that would be called under Martin
[1:11:31] Luther's message he knew exactly how
[1:11:33] many people would live in the days of
[1:11:35] John Wesley he knew exactly how many
[1:11:37] there were and my brother he knows
[1:11:40] exactly how many elected are called to
[1:11:43] this message we don't know how many but
[1:11:46] what are we doing we're searching till
[1:11:48] the last number he's at our table
[1:11:53] hallelujah God knows exactly who's
[1:11:56] elected and he won't lose one I'm so
[1:12:02] glad to know he won't lose any because
[1:12:07] he's already got him numbered he knew
[1:12:12] exactly how many would come under Wesley
[1:12:14] how many to come under Luther and he
[1:12:16] knows exactly how many is gonna be it
[1:12:19] under this anointing and you can't force
[1:12:24] someone under this anointing that's not
[1:12:26] called under this or not
[1:12:29] you may try and you may persuade and you
[1:12:33] may beg and say it's easy for me to see
[1:12:35] why can't you see it because you're
[1:12:41] called to live under this eagle flag and
[1:12:45] you can't force anyone to live under
[1:12:48] that flag only who God called he numbers
[1:12:55] all of Israel and they're to be encamped
[1:12:59] by their signet read it again in numbers
[1:13:03] chapter 2 and numbers chapter 1 he says
[1:13:06] that they shall the trim the measure
[1:13:07] shall pitch their tents every man by his
[1:13:09] own camp and every man by his own
[1:13:12] standard throughout their hosts what was
[1:13:16] it to the east to the west to the north
[1:13:19] to the south the Eagle the Ox the man
[1:13:22] the lion
[1:13:23] it was the ambassadors of truth to the
[1:13:28] entire world and guess what
[1:13:31] every time they traveled and they
[1:13:34] traveled a lot they had to pick up their
[1:13:38] camp pack it all up and march in their
[1:13:42] order no one was to get out of order no
[1:13:46] one was to get out of step if you were
[1:13:47] called to live under the Eagle anointing
[1:13:49] you can't go over to Dan you can't go
[1:13:52] over to the lion anointing lion flag
[1:13:54] endures they decide to pick up and move
[1:13:55] from this church to the other church my
[1:13:58] brother let me tell you something God's
[1:13:59] called you to a specific place a
[1:14:02] specific pastor of a Swiss Miss specific
[1:14:05] state a specific City and you could try
[1:14:08] to go live somewhere else it'll never
[1:14:10] work out God planted you in the place he
[1:14:13] called you to and you can only grow in
[1:14:16] that place that's why it's so important
[1:14:21] to find your position because you'll
[1:14:27] only be fruitful under that flag
[1:14:34] might have looked over at the next
[1:14:36] church you know Dan might have looked
[1:14:38] over and Dan might have seen you know
[1:14:41] it's a car and say you know I don't know
[1:14:43] I like the way he preaches a little bit
[1:14:45] better been streaming him lately you
[1:14:47] know I like like what he says I like
[1:14:48] their music a little better sort of
[1:14:50] getting sick and tired of the same old
[1:14:51] song same old song later same old music
[1:14:54] same old pastor same old preaching what
[1:14:58] are you doing you're trying to change
[1:14:59] your standard God called you under a
[1:15:02] standard he called you and put you in a
[1:15:04] certain place and God says be fruitful
[1:15:07] in that place I'll bless you in that
[1:15:09] land
[1:15:16] I'm calling order I'm calling you to a
[1:15:20] position and to a place I've called you
[1:15:24] under a certain anointing a certain
[1:15:26] standard and when you march Israel you
[1:15:30] have to stay in this order do you want
[1:15:35] to know what that order looked like from
[1:15:37] an aerial view go to the next slide
[1:15:39] brother here's what you had you had the
[1:15:41] Tabernacle in the center
[1:15:43] you had ephraim in the West you had
[1:15:46] Reuben in the South you had Dan in the
[1:15:48] north under the eagle yeah Judah around
[1:15:50] er the lion in the east go to the next
[1:15:53] slide this is what it looked like as
[1:15:55] they marched through the world it was
[1:15:57] the emblem of a cross what was it it was
[1:16:03] salvation to the rest of the world as
[1:16:06] they marched through life they were the
[1:16:09] ambassador of salvation
[1:16:16] Laurie what was in the middle of
[1:16:20] everything what was in the middle of all
[1:16:23] of their lives the holy spirit and my
[1:16:28] brother and my sister this was so
[1:16:30] important that the tabernacle was not at
[1:16:33] the front not at the back but at the
[1:16:35] center because the Holy Ghost should be
[1:16:37] at the center of everything you do
[1:16:39] everything you say
[1:16:41] everywhere you go every thought you
[1:16:44] think God says I I have a position you
[1:16:46] have a position
[1:16:47] what is God's place in your life at the
[1:16:50] center of everything else in your life
[1:16:54] should be the center should be Christ in
[1:16:56] Christ Oh
[1:16:58] I want to say Lord let me make you the
[1:17:01] center and as you march you have to
[1:17:06] march in this order no one break rank no
[1:17:10] one break position everyone has to march
[1:17:13] in this order four out of Judah I'll
[1:17:19] send a savior his name shall be called
[1:17:24] wonderful counselor mighty God the
[1:17:27] everlasting father Prince of Peace
[1:17:30] Israel had no idea but they were
[1:17:32] literally the ambassador's who were
[1:17:34] carrying the very seed of God in that
[1:17:39] picture God has everything invested his
[1:17:46] entire plan do you realize that he
[1:17:49] couldn't just say sorry is her you
[1:17:51] failed you messed up I gotta choose
[1:17:52] someone else know he had banked
[1:17:55] everything he had invested everything in
[1:18:00] this one nation and they didn't know but
[1:18:04] they were very they were literally
[1:18:05] carrying the very plan thought purpose
[1:18:08] mystery of God
[1:18:12] didn't look like it all the time look
[1:18:15] like a mess most of the time looked
[1:18:17] rebellious hard-hearted calloused turned
[1:18:21] their back on God spinning God's face
[1:18:23] would go sinning in the world then come
[1:18:25] back to God repenting but yet inside of
[1:18:28] that earthen vessel was the treasure
[1:18:31] that God deposited oh my brother
[1:18:33] I don't always look like the vessel of
[1:18:35] the carrier of truth the God said I've
[1:18:38] banked and placed everything I put my
[1:18:40] very seed in your life do you realize
[1:18:45] you're the carrier of the plan and
[1:18:47] purpose of God God says I've placed it
[1:18:54] all in you as the scripture says that
[1:19:00] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:19:08] we say brother Matt why is that
[1:19:10] important it's important that we hold
[1:19:12] the standard it's important that we
[1:19:16] raise the standard it's important that
[1:19:19] we don't drop the standard are you
[1:19:24] Anthony here tonight notice this as we
[1:19:27] go in just a little bit further brother
[1:19:29] Branham says listen now notice he says
[1:19:31] now this here Dan was an eagle Ruben was
[1:19:34] the man's face Ephraim is the ox you get
[1:19:36] the picture there's the way they camped
[1:19:39] in the Bible he says if you notice Dan
[1:19:41] as the head of three tribes shoot as the
[1:19:43] head of three tribes
[1:19:44] Ruben's the head of three tribes he
[1:19:45] frames the head of three tribes three
[1:19:47] four is twelve twelve tribes of Israel
[1:19:49] each with their own banner the banner of
[1:19:52] Judah was aligned the banner of Reuben
[1:19:54] man the banner of Ephraim an ox banner
[1:19:58] of Dan was an eagle and I look back at
[1:20:01] what John said one had the face of a
[1:20:03] lion the face of an eagle the face of a
[1:20:06] man notice the the face of a man the
[1:20:09] lion the ox the Eagle anointing he says
[1:20:13] let's hear read to see if it's not the
[1:20:15] same thing in heaven the first speech
[1:20:17] was a lion Judah second beast was a calf
[1:20:19] there's the young ox third beast was the
[1:20:21] face of the man
[1:20:22] the fourth beats the flying eagle just
[1:20:24] exactly the tribes of Israel camped
[1:20:28] around
[1:20:28] what were those Israel tribes they were
[1:20:30] guardians to what the tabernacle
[1:20:33] they were guard and that's why the Bible
[1:20:36] says if a stranger comes in he'll be put
[1:20:38] to death they were guarding what was it
[1:20:41] wasn't the beauty it wasn't the lights
[1:20:44] it wasn't the color God wasn't concerned
[1:20:46] about the curtains and the beads and the
[1:20:48] silver and the bells and the whistles
[1:20:51] that was not what they were guardians of
[1:20:54] they weren't guarding the Badger skin or
[1:20:57] the fine linen or the scarlet or the
[1:20:59] purple or the gold the Onyx the barrel
[1:21:02] the that the Topaz all of the precious
[1:21:04] stones that was all-important but do you
[1:21:07] realize what they were guarding they
[1:21:09] were guarding that cloud that you see
[1:21:11] right there
[1:21:11] in the middle because without that cloud
[1:21:16] all the beads and all the lights and all
[1:21:18] the all the whistles and all the colors
[1:21:20] meant nothing
[1:21:23] do you realize what your guardians of
[1:21:26] doesn't matter all your doctrine and all
[1:21:28] your theology
[1:21:29] oh you're teaching a God didn't send us
[1:21:32] a message so we could be puffed up in
[1:21:34] our head about how much we know about
[1:21:35] creation and how much we know about the
[1:21:37] revelation of God we're so smart and so
[1:21:40] intellectual and we just know we have
[1:21:42] all the secrets and that the secrets
[1:21:44] meant nothing if the life of God is not
[1:21:47] behind those secrets and mysteries
[1:21:49] you're not guardians of some
[1:21:51] intellectual knowledge or some pride
[1:21:54] electoral property or a software or a
[1:21:56] program or a tape or a book you're
[1:21:59] guardians of the very life and the so a
[1:22:02] Spirit of God we're the guardians of the
[1:22:10] way back to eternal life
[1:22:17] that spirit that pillar of fire that
[1:22:22] filled the tabernacle was what was so
[1:22:25] important to God as a whole other sermon
[1:22:29] we ain't got time for notice this is
[1:22:33] they go through this now notice each
[1:22:35] being camped under their own sign each
[1:22:38] being camped under their own sign let me
[1:22:41] just find my place here brother Branham
[1:22:44] says here I know that works he says I
[1:22:47] know that works now noticed this in this
[1:22:50] age God has given a sustainer let me
[1:22:52] just get back to some of this here today
[1:22:53] you're living in an age that is
[1:22:56] literally the Bible says is groping in
[1:22:59] darkness they don't know it they have
[1:23:03] they have no idea do you realize man
[1:23:05] thinks he's smarter than he's ever been
[1:23:08] before he thinks he's understood that we
[1:23:11] were living in the age of information
[1:23:14] they age what they call this age that
[1:23:17] we're living in where what but the Bible
[1:23:19] says you're blind miserable wretched
[1:23:22] poor naked I knowest it not behold thou
[1:23:28] say I'm rich increased with Goods and
[1:23:30] have need of nothing and knowest thou
[1:23:34] not brother Brennan said that wasn't
[1:23:35] arrogance he said they literally looked
[1:23:38] at their own self with their own human
[1:23:39] pride and said I'm perfect I'm
[1:23:43] all-knowing that age that we live in the
[1:23:48] Bible says they're groping in darkness
[1:23:50] when the world when they age the
[1:23:53] Information Age today people think
[1:23:56] they're more informed smarter than
[1:23:59] they've ever been before and you're
[1:24:01] living in the age of the Internet of
[1:24:03] Google of blogs the advent of the blog
[1:24:07] where a man could get on and take the
[1:24:09] fodder of his own mind and express my
[1:24:12] enough preaching against blogs here
[1:24:13] today I'm simply telling you it it
[1:24:15] should be a signal to something so our
[1:24:19] man has been given a platform to express
[1:24:22] what he thinks
[1:24:25] and the mind has been exalted human
[1:24:27] thought they've thought that all we need
[1:24:30] is intellect all we need is more
[1:24:32] knowledge more than ever before
[1:24:34] knowledge is increasing and then the
[1:24:37] Machine mine has been exalted to such a
[1:24:39] place we think it can it can cure all
[1:24:42] diseases it can't we think we could can
[1:24:46] conquer all problems it can't that the
[1:24:49] age in 2019 that we're living here today
[1:24:52] has the highest esteem of its own
[1:24:55] thinking it's the age of information as
[1:24:59] we said where you can just google
[1:25:02] anything and you think by what your
[1:25:04] results are giving you that you're
[1:25:06] gaining information and you're getting
[1:25:08] smarter and that could very well be the
[1:25:10] case you could be gaining intellect but
[1:25:14] most of what you're getting is the
[1:25:15] opinions of men opinions of women
[1:25:18] opinions and at the very end of all of
[1:25:21] their education all of their science all
[1:25:23] of their schooling it's just an opinion
[1:25:30] even medicine today is called practicing
[1:25:36] medicine and you're the guinea pig
[1:25:39] they're practicing on pharmaceutical
[1:25:42] drugs and a multi-billion dollar
[1:25:44] industry what are they doing their dis
[1:25:47] testing trying at the end of the day
[1:25:49] that they've solved I'm not not at all
[1:25:52] preaching against them but brother Adam
[1:25:54] said this he said civilization education
[1:25:57] it's always moving away from dependence
[1:26:00] on God and moving to dependence on self
[1:26:07] it's an age of self validation or man is
[1:26:12] literally worshiping his own thinking
[1:26:18] when they leave the truth oh what do we
[1:26:21] do we we just we were - we just use
[1:26:23] critical thinking the internet has
[1:26:26] produced an entire generation of
[1:26:29] know-it-alls
[1:26:34] adults not this children I know you
[1:26:36] thought I was talk about teenagers I'm
[1:26:38] talking about adults too I know our
[1:26:42] teenagers know it all I know they do I
[1:26:43] won't question him I know everything
[1:26:49] know everything I told my son that you
[1:26:54] teach it in the drive and they kept
[1:26:56] every time I'd correct something in his
[1:26:58] driving he'd say I know I know his first
[1:26:59] words I know I know
[1:27:00] in other words I hate that you're
[1:27:02] criticizing what I'm doing wrong I know
[1:27:03] I know I finally said Gideon stop saying
[1:27:06] I know he said I know I mean I said you
[1:27:11] keep saying I know I know I mean no I
[1:27:13] didn't mean to say that everyone knows
[1:27:16] everything in this age we're no one else
[1:27:19] we're living in the age of DIY some of
[1:27:26] y'all know what that is do it yourself
[1:27:31] I'm appreciative of DIY I use it to my
[1:27:36] own advantage sometimes DIY Google

[1:27:49] internet I googled and I did this and
[1:27:50] I'm a fixer thankfully sometimes they do

[1:29:49] but I'm trying to get you to see
[1:29:51] something here you're living in the age
[1:29:53] where man the Bible said would become a
[1:29:56] lover of his own self and you're living
[1:30:02] in the climax and the maturity of that
[1:30:05] scripture don't need a church I can
[1:30:08] distri and the next you say I don't need
[1:30:11] a prophet but here's what the word says
[1:30:19] you're groping and darkness yet they
[1:30:22] think they're smarter than ever before
[1:30:25] the world thinks they're more successful
[1:30:27] than ever before they're more fulfilled
[1:30:30] than ever before but let me take the
[1:30:33] covers and expose the world today it is
[1:30:36] going insane it is declining and

[1:31:10] because they've lost the standard of the
[1:31:14] word it's an age you say what is the age
[1:31:19] is the age of information but I ask you
[1:31:21] what is that age of information produced

[1:32:51] difference when you use the internet and
[1:32:53] when the internet uses you
[1:32:59] and most of us are used and abused more
[1:33:06] broken homes that are more broken
[1:33:08] churches that are more confused fire of
[1:33:12] the Holy Ghost gone more than it's ever

[1:33:23] I got a sin well what is it it's a it's
[1:33:30] it's giving it's a tree of knowledge of
[1:33:32] good and evil and what is it it's a
[1:33:37] standard that's been changed all my
[1:33:39] brother and my sister they think they
[1:33:41] have success because of their
[1:33:43] information and that information leads
[1:33:45] them from the message tells them that
[1:33:47] the messages are cold leads them to some
[1:33:49] other place where does it take them to
[1:33:50] addictions takes them to sin takes them
[1:33:54] to worldliness takes them to depression
[1:33:57] take some more closer and closer to the
[1:34:01] exaltation of number one they haven't
[1:34:08] found Jesus they found another Jesus the
[1:34:12] Jesus of their imagination the Jesus of
[1:34:17] their own standard or their own
[1:34:20] definition but he says here he says
[1:34:27] brother Adam says what was it it was a
[1:34:29] different standard can I just have just
[1:34:30] 10 more minutes of that be okay
[1:34:33] he says what was that it was all camped
[1:34:36] under a different standard notice this
[1:34:40] here brother you'll just follow me along
[1:34:41] in the in the quotes that you have up if
[1:34:43] you could go to those now brother Adam
[1:34:45] says what was it when the spirit when
[1:34:47] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:34:50] Spirit of God raises a standard against
[1:34:52] it so when the enemy went out as Anti
[1:34:54] Christ God sent a certain type of power
[1:34:57] out to meet him he went out again as a
[1:34:59] red horse rider another color let me
[1:35:02] just let me just find it here as they if
[1:35:04] you found it that that's paragraph 116
[1:35:06] he says there it went again
[1:35:09] as a red horse rider another color
[1:35:11] another power another ministry I don't
[1:35:14] have all of these so just follow along
[1:35:15] as I as I read them another ministry he
[1:35:19] says God sent another one after him to
[1:35:21] combat it to hold his church that's what
[1:35:24] those standards were sent for that's why
[1:35:26] they were under an anointing of a lion
[1:35:28] to hold the church to hold elected he
[1:35:32] says he sent the third one God sent His
[1:35:34] Saints in his godson his Saint his sent
[1:35:39] his Antichrist spirit to file the church
[1:35:41] to combat the church what did God do God
[1:35:44] sent his he says he sent the fourth one
[1:35:49] God sent his fourth one and then the
[1:35:52] Antichrist in and the church ages in at
[1:35:54] that time watch he says hold this is
[1:35:56] really good we see that devil is
[1:35:58] changing for beasts meant what power
[1:36:00] they was revealed to or what power he
[1:36:02] revealed to the world how they ended up
[1:36:03] in this pail dead force he says let's
[1:36:06] look at God's powers of these beasts to
[1:36:08] combat them the first beast of God went
[1:36:10] out to meet the Antichrist the
[1:36:12] Antichrist spirit when it was in it's
[1:36:14] just it's teaching remember when a
[1:36:16] Christ first rode he was in a teaching
[1:36:18] ministry the Antichrist rode in their
[1:36:20] teaching ministry watch the one that
[1:36:22] went to meet him the lion the Lion of
[1:36:24] the tribe of Judah who were they under
[1:36:28] who was Paul under who was Peter under
[1:36:31] silver and gold have I none but such as
[1:36:32] I have give IV all of those spirits the
[1:36:37] lion the man the Eagle the ox they were
[1:36:40] all the Spirit of Christ they were the
[1:36:45] throne guards and those Guardian that
[1:36:48] spirit of that of God came upon the
[1:36:51] people brother Brennan says what was it
[1:36:53] let's look at God's powers he says watch
[1:36:56] the one the men who went to meet him the
[1:36:57] Lion of the tribe of Judah which is the
[1:36:59] word when his false teaching went forth
[1:37:01] the true word went to meeting that's the
[1:37:04] reason we had an Iranian and a Polycarp
[1:37:07] and those fellows a Saint Martin when
[1:37:11] the Antichrist was riding with his false
[1:37:13] teaching God sent his teaching out the
[1:37:16] word the Lion of the tribe of Judah why
[1:37:20] do you think the Apostle Paul could say
[1:37:22] when I
[1:37:23] came to you brethren I didn't common the
[1:37:25] power of my own intellect or man's
[1:37:27] wisdom but I came in the power and the
[1:37:31] demonstration what was Paul saying when
[1:37:33] I came to you
[1:37:34] it wasn't coming with a word of in
[1:37:36] electric combat intellect for intellect
[1:37:38] but God sent an anointing of a lion upon
[1:37:42] the church the Lion of the tribe of
[1:37:44] Judah to combat the Antichrist spirit I
[1:37:48] came unto you under the power of the
[1:37:51] Holy Ghost he said that's why they had
[1:37:55] to have him he says when the Anti Christ
[1:37:57] was riding with his false teaching God
[1:37:59] said his teaching the Lion of the tribe
[1:38:00] of Judah which is the word Mane
[1:38:02] manifests in the Holy Spirit and the
[1:38:04] Holy Spirit there to manifest himself
[1:38:06] which is the word that's the reason the
[1:38:08] early church had healings and miracles
[1:38:12] and visions that's the reason you mean
[1:38:21] it wasn't because of how dedicated they
[1:38:24] were wasn't because of how perfect they
[1:38:27] were wasn't because of how spotless they
[1:38:30] were wasn't because of how intellectual
[1:38:33] no that's the reason they had miracles
[1:38:37] signs wonders killings vision powers
[1:38:41] because a Living Word in the form of the
[1:38:46] Lion of the tribe of Judah rode through
[1:38:50] their lives anointed the lives of
[1:38:52] insufficient men anointing the lives of
[1:38:55] imperfect women in perfect teenagers
[1:38:58] people with mistakes and faults and
[1:39:00] failures but an anointing of God so
[1:39:03] filled their life that no devil in hell
[1:39:09] could stand before that first church
[1:39:12] because why the Living Word of God Oh
[1:39:15] hallelujah he says now the second beast
[1:39:19] went out was a red beast that he rode on
[1:39:21] was to take the place in the earth and
[1:39:23] war second one that when to combat him
[1:39:25] was the ox beats the Ox means labor
[1:39:27] beasts of burden if we gonna stop let me
[1:39:29] tell you just to be sure you see this
[1:39:30] that's the kind that might be a little
[1:39:31] puzzling and move on move on just pass
[1:39:34] this brother to the next quote that you
[1:39:35] have
[1:39:36] it's the very next line he says hey man
[1:39:39] now you got it
[1:39:40] he sends his power I love this he says
[1:39:43] he sends his power Antichrist God sends
[1:39:47] his word Antichrist false teaching the
[1:39:50] true cheat he went with it to combat it
[1:39:52] now that was the first one now this was
[1:39:54] the first church apostolic that went out
[1:39:58] to meet him keep going brother he says
[1:40:01] now notice this he says and another
[1:40:03] thing the Ox is also a beasts of
[1:40:05] sacrifice see they just gave their lives
[1:40:08] just as freely as they could give them
[1:40:11] in the Dark Ages a thousand years there
[1:40:16] that catholicism controlled the world
[1:40:20] they just gave their lives as freely as
[1:40:25] they could give them why they were under
[1:40:29] an anointing they gave their lives as
[1:40:35] freely as they can give them I love this
[1:40:38] he says they went out and died they
[1:40:41] didn't mind dying he says he says here
[1:40:44] they just went right in yes or no they
[1:40:46] didn't mind dying they didn't mind dying
[1:40:50] what did they did they not like their
[1:40:53] life did they not love their life like
[1:40:54] you loved yours and I love mine and
[1:40:57] there's nothing wrong with saying that
[1:40:59] you love life no one likes to die let me
[1:41:03] tell you something my brother my sister
[1:41:04] these people under the Ochs anointing
[1:41:07] and those dark ages were no different
[1:41:10] than you and me but something got ahold
[1:41:17] of their life something got ahold of
[1:41:21] these ordinary people they weren't
[1:41:23] morbid in their mind they loved their
[1:41:25] children they loved their lives they
[1:41:27] didn't want to die he says but they
[1:41:30] didn't mind dying if it was death that's
[1:41:33] all right they went and died anyhow why
[1:41:38] the very spirit of the
[1:41:43] what was it when they held a gun when
[1:41:46] that when they win the totem denounced
[1:41:47] Christ revealed Christ announced him
[1:41:51] denounced mrl will burn the house then
[1:41:54] with your children in it you say oh my
[1:41:56] what would I do in that situation of
[1:41:58] persecution game to such a point if
[1:42:01] persecution game to such a point tore
[1:42:03] they were gonna take my life oh I don't
[1:42:05] know what I could do you know why you
[1:42:06] don't know what you could do they didn't
[1:42:09] know what they could do either the
[1:42:10] difference is is that they were under an
[1:42:13] anointing of a standard that God had
[1:42:16] sent you're not under that anointing but
[1:42:23] they were under a power and let me say
[1:42:26] this my brother my sister was a power
[1:42:27] that was not within themself it was very
[1:42:29] much without of themselves it was very
[1:42:33] much a power that God had released to
[1:42:35] combat the Antichrist spirit and they
[1:42:38] willingly gave their life that's the
[1:42:41] reason I rainiest that's the reason go
[1:42:44] on Polycarp Paul John those great mighty
[1:42:47] men out there combating that thing
[1:42:49] Polycarp was fed to the Lions
[1:42:51] he says they know he was burned it was
[1:42:55] too late for them to turn a lion loose
[1:42:56] on the arena so they tore down a
[1:42:58] bathroom
[1:42:59] imagine this an old bathhouse there put
[1:43:02] him in their arena and burned him and on
[1:43:04] his road coming down he was walking with
[1:43:06] this head down the Roman centurion said
[1:43:07] you're an old man how well-respected
[1:43:09] Polycarp why don't you just announce so
[1:43:12] easy just announced this thing it's so
[1:43:15] simple I mean you know just announce it
[1:43:17] and God knows what you mean you know we
[1:43:19] link you know cross your fingers
[1:43:20] you know God God isn't gonna look at
[1:43:22] that Polycarp who cares what people say
[1:43:24] it you could always go back and repent
[1:43:25] you know Peter was restored to denied
[1:43:27] Christ
[1:43:27] no doubt the devil could say anything to
[1:43:29] polygon and he could put any thought and
[1:43:32] whisper anything in his mind here on oh
[1:43:35] man well respected why don't you just
[1:43:37] announce that thing he just kept looking
[1:43:39] towards heaven Oh glory to God
[1:43:44] can you see that st. there as the last
[1:43:47] brother Adam says he kept looking
[1:43:48] towards seven and I've always spoke from
[1:43:50] somewhere they couldn't understand where
[1:43:52] said Polycarp don't fear I'm with you
[1:43:58] why he was standing with that word they
[1:44:04] begin to pile boards on him to burning
[1:44:06] there was a heavenly music come down the
[1:44:09] anthems from some angelic somewhere sang
[1:44:12] the song he never even one time batted
[1:44:14] an eye to the skull fur that's gallant
[1:44:16] men that's men who could stand martyrs
[1:44:19] down through the ages they suffer
[1:44:21] terribly but what was they they were
[1:44:23] under the inspiration the Spirit of God
[1:44:27] the power of God they couldn't explain
[1:44:30] why they were living the way they were
[1:44:32] living Polycarp couldn't give you and
[1:44:34] take a chalkboard and draw it out all he
[1:44:37] knew was there was an anointing upon his
[1:44:39] life he must fulfill the word that God
[1:44:43] has put in his life because God sent an
[1:44:46] anointing upon his life you say how was
[1:44:48] Polycarp and overcomer the same way
[1:44:50] you're gonna be an overcomer now because
[1:44:53] of you not because of yourself but an
[1:44:55] anointing of an eagle that anoints your
[1:44:58] life to overcome the world the
[1:45:07] inspiration of God came upon his life
[1:45:11] now don't forget this church brethren on
[1:45:14] the tape I want you to examine this
[1:45:17] how could men do anything else besides
[1:45:21] the power of God that has been released
[1:45:26] released
[1:45:30] oh do we do we catch this my brother and
[1:45:33] my sister
[1:45:34] or are we catching our message our day
[1:45:37] and it's our are we catching it here
[1:45:40] today he says how could they do it apart
[1:45:43] from anything but the power of God
[1:45:45] that's going that's been released to
[1:45:47] them he says I'm gonna sit this box up
[1:45:50] here to represent that if God sends a
[1:45:53] spritzer and spirit among them that's
[1:45:56] the only thing they can work by you say
[1:46:04] were they possessed they were yes right
[1:46:12] answer or they possessed they were
[1:46:15] possessed of a spirit from another world
[1:46:20] they were possessed from a spirit that
[1:46:23] came directly from the throne room of
[1:46:25] God and entered into their heart you say
[1:46:29] how I could never do that
[1:46:30] I put myself in that position brother
[1:46:32] they couldn't have done it either
[1:46:34] apart from the power of God that God had
[1:46:37] sent to their life and you can't do
[1:46:39] anything you say how am I gonna what
[1:46:41] what's in front of us God isn't calling
[1:46:43] us to give our life at a stake or to be
[1:46:46] burned that's not the anointing that
[1:46:48] you're facing but a spirit has been
[1:46:51] released in this age from the Antichrist
[1:46:54] called a pale horse rider and that pale
[1:46:57] horse rider is a conglomeration a
[1:46:59] mixture of every spirit do you realize
[1:47:03] what you're facing every day when you
[1:47:07] woke up this morning it may have felt
[1:47:09] like an ordinary day but in another
[1:47:11] dimension every demon in hell was trying
[1:47:14] to afflict you and mess up your family
[1:47:17] and mess up your children and assault
[1:47:19] your mind and a soldier marriage every
[1:47:22] demon spirit was trying to affect you do
[1:47:29] we realize what we're facing my brother
[1:47:30] and my sister we're facing
[1:47:33] Satan's grand finale
[1:47:37] where he pulls out every play from the
[1:47:40] playbook
[1:47:41] where he pulls out every trick every
[1:47:43] scheme you're in the darkest age you're
[1:47:47] in the darkest time you're in a time of
[1:47:49] more confusion where world's going
[1:47:52] insane and Satan has every gun trained
[1:47:55] on you but God says what is God going to
[1:47:57] do to stand back and say figure it out
[1:48:00] you're just gonna have to figure it out
[1:48:01] no God says from the throne room of God
[1:48:04] I'm gonna send an eagle anointing to
[1:48:07] make you rise up out of the world rise
[1:48:10] up out of your depression rise up out of
[1:48:14] your trouble and fly into an atmosphere
[1:48:17] where there's peace and joy how can you
[1:48:20] say a man and happiness and love cut
[1:48:27] says I've got an anointing and just as
[1:48:31] much as Polycarp just as much as the the
[1:48:34] martyrs of the Dark Ages had no chance
[1:48:37] of overcoming the spirit of their age
[1:48:39] apart from an anointing neither do you
[1:48:42] have any chance unless you're under this
[1:48:46] eagle you see why it's so important to
[1:48:51] be under your anointing and God has a
[1:48:56] very specific anointing for this age and
[1:49:00] that creature is not a man we didn't get
[1:49:03] time to it but another age the brother
[1:49:06] Branham says what did God have to do he
[1:49:07] had a sentence in the spirit of a man a
[1:49:09] shrewdness and
[1:49:10] intellect that came to man but that's
[1:49:13] not the spirit you're under some people
[1:49:16] think that's what they're under the
[1:49:17] spirit of intellect and man and man
[1:49:18] followers and man worshipers and but
[1:49:21] that's not the spirit one under we're
[1:49:23] not following a man we're not looking to
[1:49:26] a man we're looking to an eagle the
[1:49:28] great eagle the mighty God unveiled and
[1:49:32] God said you gotta come under the
[1:49:33] anointing of the eagle if you want to
[1:49:36] rise above it I say tonight I want to
[1:49:38] rise above my problems I want
[1:49:41] above my troubles I want to rise does
[1:49:43] anybody want to rise here tonight say I
[1:49:46] want to come out of my depression come
[1:49:48] out of my my issue in my trial I want to
[1:49:51] fly into the heavenlies Oh somebody say
[1:49:56] praise the Lord here tonight I'm gonna
[1:49:58] fly above all my problems Oh
[1:50:01] stand to your feet here tonight say God
[1:50:04] give me that spirit to rise above it I

[1:51:14] and to hold that standard high to keep
[1:51:18] that flag raised that flag that had 19
[1:51:23] Lord you sent us a prophet messenger
[1:51:26] under that eagle anointing and he could
[1:51:30] see Lord ahead you gave him vision a
[1:51:32] gift a message a word
[1:51:37] you gave him a word Lord a word that
[1:51:42] would meet the challenge of this day
[1:51:46] you've not asked us to give our opinion
[1:51:48] to add to take but you've called us to
[1:51:54] camp under that standard let us do that
[1:51:59] tonight Lord Lord if we fallen out of
[1:52:03] that encampment may we may be weary
[1:52:05] establish may we let the word
[1:52:07] reestablish asunder that anointing for
[1:52:11] this word has an anointing upon it Satan
[1:52:13] attacks it from every side from within
[1:52:16] from without from ministry from people
[1:52:18] from outsiders for I the Lord from every
[1:52:20] way from society we have every gun
[1:52:23] trained against us Lord but in this word
[1:52:25] is a power that will lift this bride off
[1:52:29] the earth someday one day Lord we're
[1:52:33] gonna take her flight like a mighty hero
[1:52:38] today Lord were living in Satan's Iduna

[1:52:48] wrong Co world mixed with opinions our
[1:52:54] own mixed with ideas all motivated by
[1:52:58] fear motivated by greed motivated by
[1:53:04] pride
[1:53:07] Lord but you've not called us to feed
[1:53:09] upon that but you've given us a word
[1:53:12] that we can feed upon Lord and then that
[1:53:16] word we can receive life and for a week
[1:53:19] we can raise the hands tonight you can
[1:53:21] raise them tonight and say Lord honey
[1:53:23] strength would you give me strength from

[1:53:29] carry and dead carcass somewhere I want
[1:53:32] to feed upon that word or I can receive
[1:53:34] strength for my journey or I can receive

[1:54:04] move and stay in order stay in step
[1:54:06] don't get out of line don't start
[1:54:09] looking at the other church don't start
[1:54:10] looking at that which his brother Adam
[1:54:12] sees in that vision and he screams stay
[1:54:14] in line get back in line get back in
[1:54:16] step Oh God let me let me hi say that
[1:54:19] tonight Lord I want to get back in step
[1:54:21] I want to get back in line with your
[1:54:23] word oh god I'm gonna be marching to the
[1:54:26] to the right rhythm to the right tune to
[1:54:28] the right beat Granite Lord Jesus
[1:54:37] the Roman army was one of the most
[1:54:40] successful armies you study history
[1:54:43] Roman army was one of the most
[1:54:44] successful armies conquered the entire
[1:54:46] known world you notice what was
[1:54:50] different about the Roman army they all
[1:54:54] dressed the same
[1:54:56] they all look the same those Romans were
[1:55:00] different than everybody else there was
[1:55:02] strict uniformity they all had to wear
[1:55:05] the same clothing same hat same hair
[1:55:09] same everything everything had to be the
[1:55:10] same they were different than the rest
[1:55:12] of the world and their success was in
[1:55:16] their uniformity the unity that the
[1:55:18] Roman army had conquered the entire
[1:55:22] known world as we said part of their
[1:55:25] success was their communication they had
[1:55:30] trumpet blowers people that would blow a
[1:55:32] certain sound that would signal a
[1:55:34] different command was death he could be
[1:55:37] put to death if you blew the wrong
[1:55:39] uncertain sound that that trumpet player
[1:55:43] it was so important for him to blow the
[1:55:46] right tune because the entire army was
[1:55:48] dependent upon the sound that they heard
[1:55:51] from that trumpet the Bible says that if
[1:55:54] the trumpet blow an uncertain sound who
[1:55:56] can prepare himself to battle and this
[1:55:59] this Roman army was so unified in
[1:56:03] purpose they had a loyalty amongst them
[1:56:07] everywhere they went they wore the badge
[1:56:10] the signet they had a flag and on that
[1:56:13] flag was the face of Caesar
[1:56:15] they had a loyalty to their king and
[1:56:18] they all shared that common loyalty and
[1:56:22] that flag was always put before them to
[1:56:24] constantly be raised up to remind him
[1:56:28] you're not fighting for yourself you're
[1:56:30] fighting for a greater purpose
[1:56:32] a greater calls I know my brother that
[1:56:35] Roman army fought for a carnal purpose
[1:56:37] but today were part of an army and God
[1:56:41] has called us to a uniformity God has
[1:56:43] called us to be an army where we all
[1:56:46] look the same we all dress the
[1:56:48] we all speak the same language and we
[1:56:53] all have a banner a flag and there's a
[1:56:56] face on our flag and it's the face of
[1:56:58] our King
[1:56:59] and every time the prophet of God what
[1:57:01] would he do he would lift the name of
[1:57:03] Jesus he wouldn't lift the name of a man
[1:57:06] he wouldn't lift the name of an opinion
[1:57:08] but he would raise the name of Jesus to
[1:57:11] remind the army this is who you're
[1:57:13] fighting for that Roman army eventually
[1:57:19] found its demise and historians say that
[1:57:23] the main reason why the Roman army was
[1:57:26] defeated and the Romans fell was for one
[1:57:30] simple reason they changed their
[1:57:32] requirements for membership you see to
[1:57:39] be in the Roman army before you had to
[1:57:41] be a Roman citizen had to be you had to
[1:57:45] be born that's why Paul when he's before
[1:57:49] Festus in acts 25 okay and in the book
[1:57:52] of Acts where Paul since I'm a Roman by
[1:57:54] birth a citizen natural born citizen by
[1:57:56] birth it meant something to be born but
[1:57:59] when they changed their citizenship it
[1:58:02] allowed hired mercenaries from other
[1:58:05] countries to join the Roman army lasted
[1:58:08] for her for a long time but eventually
[1:58:11] what happened when you bro Outsiders
[1:58:14] into the Roman army they didn't all
[1:58:16] speak the same language so communication
[1:58:18] broke down not only that they weren't
[1:58:21] all loyal to Caesar but they were in
[1:58:26] that army for their own purposes and
[1:58:28] they allowed anybody to join the army
[1:58:32] and then what happened when they
[1:58:34] couldn't speak the same language
[1:58:36] confusion came and the army dispersed
[1:58:40] and fell apart my brother my sister
[1:58:42] don't you realize why it's so important
[1:58:45] that we don't change our method of
[1:58:48] membership and our method of membership
[1:58:51] into this army is not a book not shaking
[1:58:53] a preacher's hand not paying your ties
[1:58:55] but you've got to be born by the Holy
[1:58:58] Spirit that's the standard that God's
[1:59:01] given
[1:59:02] the church the only way in this army is
[1:59:05] to be born in this army and if you're
[1:59:10] not born you can be born again here
[1:59:12] tonight you can be born into that army
[1:59:15] it was an important thing that they kept
[1:59:18] the standard eventually the dress code
[1:59:20] changed the cygnets changed the standard
[1:59:23] change and that's what the devil is
[1:59:26] trying to attack in our generation as
[1:59:28] our standard the standard of the word a
[1:59:33] standard of holiness it's on an outright
[1:59:37] assault by the enemy yeah an outright a
[1:59:45] soul you take the civil war same way
[1:59:49] though but the Confederate Army though
[1:59:52] the Union Army they all had signet
[1:59:55] insignia they had a banner they had a
[1:59:59] sign that they had to hold they had a
[2:00:01] flag bearer and that flag bear if you go
[2:00:04] read history of the Civil War that man
[2:00:06] who bore the flag was one of the most
[2:00:08] outside of the general was one of the
[2:00:10] most important men in the army the flag
[2:00:14] bearer he also had the shortest life
[2:00:17] expectancy because the enemy trained
[2:00:21] their guns on the flag bearer because he
[2:00:24] bore the standard of the army what was
[2:00:28] his position his position was to show
[2:00:31] where the line was so you didn't get in
[2:00:33] front of the line so that you weren't
[2:00:35] behind the line his position was to bear
[2:00:38] the flag of the army of the battalion
[2:00:41] that they were in that was their purpose
[2:00:43] the flag was to bring position why did
[2:00:47] god senator eagle anointing to bring us
[2:00:50] to our position in the family of God and
[2:00:54] the most important role was the flag
[2:00:57] bearer because when when the fire when
[2:01:02] the shot started being fired and war got
[2:01:04] hot and smoke began to billow and men's
[2:01:07] minds as they were shell-shocked by the
[2:01:10] sound of cannons and smoke was
[2:01:12] everywhere and they hit the ground and
[2:01:15] the army was was scattered what did they
[2:01:18] do they looked up they were trying to
[2:01:21] find that flag because they knew if they
[2:01:24] could see the flag if they could see the
[2:01:26] standard they could get to the right
[2:01:29] position in the right place of the army
[2:01:32] but the devil knew if I could take out
[2:01:34] the stead the flag bearer if I could
[2:01:36] shoot the if I could take out the the
[2:01:38] standard-bearer the confusion will ensue
[2:01:41] and it'll bring mass in in the churches
[2:01:44] and mass confusion to the people that's
[2:01:46] why the devil is attacking our standard
[2:01:49] but here's my message tonight raise up
[2:01:51] the standard and hold your flag high I
[2:01:56] [Applause]
[2:01:58] want to say how many can say that here
[2:02:00] with me tonight Lord let me raise up my
[2:02:04] standard when the enemy comes rushing in
