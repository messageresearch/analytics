[14:53] stepping. Oh yes it is. Amen.
[14:57] Along the trail
[15:01] that's winding
[15:03] always upward.
[15:07] This trouble world
[15:10] is not my final home.
[15:16] But until then,

[15:30] with joy we're going to carry on

[18:15] when I was struggling
[18:18] to find my way.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, we heard a song.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; I heard the sweetest song
[18:27] sent to me from the throne. A song of
[18:32] love and grace. Anybody
[18:38] know about the grace of Jesus? The
[18:42] &gt;&gt; grace of Jesus.

[19:08] &gt;&gt; He came and broke the chains of sin and
[19:12] death and hell. Aren't you glad that he
[19:14] did this morning that I could use his
[19:17] name to defend myself.

[20:04] morning.

[20:59] in my body's beating rest.
[21:06] I can wipe away my tears.
[21:13] I can change the atmosphere
[21:20] when I'm not feeling my best
[21:27] and my body's needing rest.
[21:34] I can wipe away my tears
[21:41] and I can change the atmosphere.
[21:48] When my heart is overwhelmed
[21:55] and I can't seem to calm myself.
[22:02] If I can just get my mind clear,
[22:09] I can change the atmosphere.
[22:16] When my heart is overwhelmed
[22:23] and I can't seem to calm myself
[22:30] if I can just get my mind clear.

[23:20] and you need a song to sing,

[23:41] We are more than conquerors.
[23:48] Jesus told us in his words
[23:55] that we can push away all fear
[24:02] and we can change the atmosphere.
[24:09] Yes, we are more than conquerors.
[24:16] Jesus told us in his word
[24:23] that we can push away all fears
[24:30] and we can change the atmosphere.

[26:23] The timeless theme.
[26:27] Earth and heaven will pass
[26:32] away.
[26:34] It's not a dream.
[26:38] God will make all things new.
[26:42] that day.
[26:45] Gone
[26:47] is the curse from which I stumbled
[26:53] and fell.

[28:26] from the book

[31:12] enjoy the specials this morning.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's sing an old an
[31:16] old song. We've sung a million times,
[31:18] but it's always going to be true. He

[31:23] need. Brother Randy, he's the only one
[31:25] that could take care of it. Amen.
[31:28] I shall forever
[31:35] lift
[31:37] mine eyes to Calary.
[31:44] Oh, of view the cross
[31:50] where Jesus
[31:52] died
[31:53] for me.
[31:59] How marvelous
[32:04] the grace that caught my falling
[32:10] soul.
[32:13] He looked beyond
[32:19] all my fault
[32:22] and sorrow.
[32:24] Sing you one more time from your heart
[32:26] this morning.
[32:28] Oh, I shall
[32:31] for him.
[32:59] How marvelous
[33:05] the grace that caught my falling
[33:11] soul.
[33:14] He looked
[33:16] beyond
[33:18] beyond
[33:20] all our thoughts and saw
[33:24] our need. Sing it together, shall we?
[33:29] I shall
[33:36] lift
[33:38] my eyes
[33:40] to come to Calvary.
[33:47] the cross to the cross for Jesus
[33:55] for you and me
[34:00] how
[34:04] you are Jesus. Thank you Lord.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; The grace that come

[34:12] soul
[34:16] looked beyond
[34:21] our fraord.
[34:32] Thank God.
[34:36] Praise the Lord.
[34:38] We're so grateful he could do that for
[34:40] us.
[34:42] But I'll tell you, the more I read into
[34:44] his word, the more I look into the
[34:47] message of the hour, the more I realize
[34:50] how much more he wants us to be like
[34:52] him. Amen.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; So, it's not just him loving his
[34:58] enemies,
[35:00] but us loving ours.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Well, you say he loved his enemies.
[35:06] Yeah, he loved you, didn't he?
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Every one of us was an enemy to God.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; We were born that way.
[35:17] Don't you see when he tells us to love
[35:19] our enemies, he's telling us to do what
[35:22] he's already done himself.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; You see how godly we are when we do that
[35:29] and how ungodly we are when we don't.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; No matter how long your hair is,
[35:35] sisters, you may dress just perfectly on
[35:38] the outside, but you see, until we
[35:41] achieve these things, friends, what are
[35:43] we doing? What are we accomplishing? We
[35:47] put our church clothes on and go to
[35:49] church and play tapes every now and then
[35:51] and sing religious songs. I don't want
[35:54] just that.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; I want to be like him.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Isn't it
[36:00] wonderful to be able to be in church
[36:01] today?
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Matthew chapter 4 if you
[36:05] would.
[36:08] Matthew chapter 4 verse 43. Here we are
[36:12] up into almost the third week of January
[36:16] and we ain't had to cancel church
[36:18] because of snow and ice.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; I'm one happy pastor.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; I don't like winter time anyway, but I
[36:24] sure don't like it when we can't have
[36:26] church.
[36:28] Listen carefully now to the words of our
[36:30] Lord Jesus.
[36:34] You have heard
[36:37] that it has been
[36:40] said
[36:42] and let me just give you a heads up.
[36:45] Sometimes you have to be very careful
[36:48] on what you've heard has been said
[36:52] to make sure that it was God who said
[36:55] it.
[36:57] Ye have heard that it has been said,
[37:02] thou shalt love
[37:04] thy neighbor
[37:06] and hate
[37:08] thine enemy.
[37:11] Now part of this is scripture
[37:14] and part of it is addition from man's
[37:17] ideas.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; But by now they had merged it together
[37:23] and made it one saying. One was 100%
[37:27] truth and the other was error
[37:32] and they merged it together to be one
[37:36] saying.
[37:38] Ye have heard that it has been said,
[37:41] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[37:44] thine enemy. But I say unto you,
[37:50] love your enemies.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[37:56] Love your enemies.
[37:59] Bless them that curse you.
[38:03] Do good to them that hate you.
[38:07] And pray for them which despitefully use
[38:10] you and persecute you.
[38:15] This is the reason why
[38:18] that you may be the children
[38:21] of your father which is in heaven.
[38:25] You mean it's that important to God? It
[38:29] is.
[38:30] For he maketh his son to rise on the
[38:33] evil and on the good and sendeth rain on
[38:38] the just and on the unjust.
[38:43] How many lives to be remembered today in
[38:44] prayer? Also need prayer today. I've not
[38:48] been feeling well since Thursday. Just
[38:51] desire your prayers today.
[38:54] Lord Jesus, we count it such a great
[38:56] honor and a privilege to be able to be
[38:58] gathered together today.
[39:01] Thank you, Lord, that I was feeling
[39:03] better that I could come to church
[39:05] today.
[39:07] I love church.
[39:10] I love it when I can get in your
[39:12] presence and I love it when I can get
[39:14] with your children.
[39:17] We just love it, Father, because it's a
[39:19] little foretaste of what heaven will be
[39:21] like.
[39:23] So we pray today, Lord, that you would
[39:25] help us. You saw the hands that were
[39:28] uplifted, Father, and you know, every
[39:30] need, every request, dear Jesus, this
[39:33] prayer cloth that I have on my hand
[39:35] today for her, Sister Ruth Ward. We're
[39:38] praying for her, Lord, and just asking
[39:41] you to move for these needs in her body.
[39:44] I know, Lord, she's desirous just to go
[39:48] home,
[39:49] step out of this old house that she's
[39:52] held a prisoner in. But we believe our
[39:55] days are allotted by you. So we pray
[39:59] that you would help her and be with her,
[40:01] Father. Dear God, strengthen our sister.
[40:05] Father, I'm asking you today. I normally
[40:08] don't do it, but I'm asking you for
[40:10] myself that you'd help me.
[40:14] Give me strength, Lord Jesus. Help me to
[40:17] be able to get out of the way. Father,
[40:20] that you can speak through me your words
[40:22] to your children. They've come today
[40:25] with needs in their lives. Some of them
[40:27] have driven a long way. So, dear God, I
[40:30] don't want to waste their time. And I
[40:32] know if you will come, it won't be a
[40:34] waste of time. So help me that I can
[40:37] submit everything that I have. I'm not
[40:41] 100% today. And for that I apologize.
[40:46] And I pray that you would take whatever
[40:48] that I can submit to you, Lord, and use
[40:51] it for your honor and your glory in the
[40:54] name of the Lord Jesus. And the saints
[40:56] said,
[40:57] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, saints. You may be
[41:00] seated.
[41:06] And everybody look at me.
[41:09] Don't get your eyes on me.
[41:13] Don't sit there and worry and how is he?
[41:15] Is he fixing to die? No, I ain't fixing
[41:18] to die. I ain't fixing to kick the
[41:20] bucket. I just don't feel good. But
[41:22] let's not focus on that. Let's focus on
[41:26] today's service
[41:27] &gt;&gt; and what God has for us.
[41:32] Let me draw your attention back to verse
[41:35] 43.
[41:36] You have heard that it has been said,
[41:40] "Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[41:43] thine enemy."
[41:45] Now actually Leviticus 198
[41:48] 19:18 rather tells the children of
[41:52] Israel to love thy neighbor.
[41:56] But it does not tell them to hate their
[42:00] enemy.
[42:02] So where
[42:04] did this come from? Both scribes and
[42:07] Pharisees agreed
[42:10] that this should be something that would
[42:14] be added to the commandment of God.
[42:18] So by the time Jesus gets there, now
[42:21] it's been many hundreds of years since
[42:23] they've had this attitude. And by the
[42:26] time Jesus gets there, this is quoted as
[42:30] if though it was scripture itself.
[42:35] Do you can imagine then if you were a
[42:37] scribe or Pharisee and you were setting
[42:40] under their teaching believing them to
[42:43] be men of God and servants of God and
[42:46] you heard them quote this and they said
[42:49] love your neighbors and pray for them
[42:52] and be kind to them but don't you ever
[42:54] forget hate them Philistines hate them
[42:58] Amorites
[42:59] hate them Gentiles and you'd leave
[43:02] church that day was the attitude Dude,
[43:05] my priest, my Sadducee, my Pharisee head
[43:09] told me to hate our enemies and I'm
[43:13] going to hate them. So here's Peter,
[43:17] James, John, Bartholomew, Matthew, James
[43:21] the Less, James the Great. All of these
[43:24] men had a religious background, either
[43:27] Pharisee or Sadducee,
[43:30] and they have this instilled in them
[43:32] since children. Hate your enemies.
[43:36] People do something against you, don't
[43:38] you never forget it. And you get back at
[43:42] them if it's the last thing that you do.
[43:46] And here stands Peter, a Pharisee. Here
[43:48] stands John, a Pharisee, other brothers
[43:51] that are a scenes and Sadducees.
[43:54] And they hear Jesus say these words.
[43:58] Their world must have been turned upside
[44:03] down.
[44:06] Now notice what a treacherous thing this
[44:09] is when men leaders, religious leaders
[44:14] will take truth and merge their own
[44:18] ideas in with it and mix it together and
[44:23] hand it out to the people. And it may
[44:26] not happen initially, first time they
[44:28] say it, first week, first six months,
[44:31] maybe even the first year. But if
[44:33] they're not careful in time, the lines
[44:36] will become so blurred from what is
[44:39] really truth to that man's idea that it
[44:44] will merge together and be one and the
[44:47] same.
[44:49] And then what you've done is allowed
[44:51] God's word, the absolute
[44:55] to become mixed up with some man's
[44:59] ideal. Well, I think this is should be
[45:01] this way. I think that should be that
[45:04] way. And it starts out as an I think and
[45:07] then the time I believe and then it
[45:11] becomes church doctrine.
[45:13] Then it becomes so dominant
[45:17] that it takes years sometimes to get it
[45:20] out of people's lives and it's buried so
[45:24] deep in their subconscious that it can
[45:27] flare up even years after they've been
[45:30] washed away from it doctrally. Now
[45:33] watch. He said, "But I say unto you,
[45:36] love your enemies and bless them." Now,
[45:39] are are we supposed to love the conduct
[45:42] of our enemies?
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Are we supposed to love their behavior,
[45:48] their talk, the way they dress, the way
[45:51] they act? What do we love their souls?
[45:55] We love their souls and we pray that God
[45:59] can have mercy on them. And the church
[46:02] said, "So, we pray for them and actually
[46:06] seek their good." Now, let me just share
[46:08] something with you that a lot of the
[46:11] nations in the Old Testament would have
[46:14] never found a place in scripture had it
[46:18] not been for them being the enemy of the
[46:22] children of Israel. God would have never
[46:26] even named them whatsoever.
[46:30] But they found their place because they
[46:33] were opposition to the people of God.
[46:37] And I'll tell you, as I studied this
[46:39] yesterday, I had to laugh a little bit.
[46:41] And I thought, well, in reality, I guess
[46:44] there's some people that would have
[46:47] never made it into my prayers
[46:50] had it not been for the injury that they
[46:54] did to me.
[46:57] It ain't people that you just, you know,
[46:59] just randomly pick out and and pray for.
[47:02] But when they do injure you as a real
[47:06] son or daughter of God to be like God,
[47:10] we are taught to pray for them. Now,
[47:12] when I say that, I don't mean, Lord God,
[47:15] I pray you'd send lightning down out of
[47:18] heaven. May their kids all die. May
[47:21] their crops burn up.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, send your wrath and let me
[47:28] deliver it, Lord. That's not the kind of
[47:30] prayers that we're to pray for them. So
[47:34] to pray for them is ask God to be
[47:37] merciful. These are my terms that I tell
[47:40] him all the time. If they are savable,
[47:43] save them, Lord. And if they're not
[47:45] bride, at least let them be church. Let
[47:48] them at least be saved. Praise the Lord.
[47:51] You understand? It might be your prayer
[47:54] and your attitude to some mortal out
[47:56] here that God would save them because
[47:59] you simply asked him to. And God would
[48:03] be so moved by you being like him. He
[48:07] would answer your prayer. Remember, it
[48:10] was the very prayer of the righteous man
[48:13] Abraham interceding for Lot. We know
[48:17] what kind of guy he was. It was not
[48:19] Lot's prayer. It was not Lot's wife nor
[48:22] Lot's children that saved them. It was
[48:26] simply because an elect member of the
[48:29] body of God and had such imprint upon
[48:33] God's own divine nature that God saved a
[48:37] man like Lot, which was nothing but a
[48:40] penny. I'll tell you, it's quite an
[48:42] honor if a silver dollar is praying for
[48:44] you.
[48:46] Now, think, I wonder how many more
[48:50] that we should pray for. What if God
[48:53] would honor your prayer or my prayer and
[48:57] God would move on someone's heart and
[49:00] they themselves not even have the
[49:02] ability to be bride, not even have the
[49:05] capability to reach up where you ever
[49:07] would, but you in mercy and you in grace
[49:12] petition our heavenly father and God
[49:14] moves upon their heart. My should make
[49:16] us want to pray for folks more.
[49:19] Now I want you to think that love will
[49:22] give blessing back in return for
[49:27] cursing.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Real divine love does not love after
[49:32] like. It does not love those who love
[49:37] it. Notice in 1 Corinthians chapter 4:12
[49:41] that Paul says, "And labor, working with
[49:44] our own hands, being reviled, we bless.
[49:49] Being persecuted,
[49:52] we suffer it." So they were treated one
[49:56] way and did the exact opposite. I want
[49:58] you to notice that these men of God
[50:01] living in this age, they were not just
[50:03] identified by signs and wonders. They
[50:05] were they had that there. But that
[50:08] within itself is not what identifies us
[50:11] with the divine nature. As a matter of
[50:13] fact, I read it the other day where the
[50:15] prophet said that faith can come from a
[50:18] heart to do great supernatural miracles
[50:22] and not even come from a sincere heart.
[50:25] You imagine a person have great faith to
[50:29] be able to see God do mighty things and
[50:32] not even come from a genuine heart. Lord
[50:35] help us. Watch 1 Peter chapter 2 verse
[50:38] 20. And Peter said, "For what glory is
[50:42] it, if when ye be buffeted for your
[50:46] faults, ye shall take it patiently? But
[50:50] what if when you do well and suffer for
[50:54] it, you take it patiently? This is
[50:57] acceptable with God. For even where here
[51:01] unto were ye called, I hope everybody
[51:05] hears this today. You are called to be
[51:08] persecuted when you live right. You're
[51:10] called, oh yes, to be ridiculed, laughed
[51:13] at, made fun of when you live right.
[51:16] This is part of your calling. Praise the
[51:18] Lord. Notice now, oh, I I love this.
[51:22] Because Christ also suffered for us,
[51:26] leaving us an example, that ye should
[51:31] follow his steps. Now, here's some of
[51:34] his steps. Who did no sin, neither was G
[51:40] found in his mouth, who when he was
[51:45] reviled,
[51:46] reviled not again. When he suffered, he
[51:50] threatened not. Notice the polar
[51:54] opposites that he took. He was reviled
[51:58] against, but he didn't get back.
[52:00] Whatever they said against him, he went
[52:03] the exact opposite. When he suffered, he
[52:06] threatened not. Now, what is this? Is
[52:09] contrary to human nature. It's contrary
[52:12] to a great majority of the population of
[52:15] the earth on the today because there's
[52:18] something about it that's built up in
[52:20] the human makeup to defend oursel and
[52:24] especially when there's lies being told
[52:26] against us and people are accusing us of
[52:29] things and we're just as innocent as we
[52:31] can be. Then we want to take it into our
[52:33] own hands and say, "I'll get back with
[52:36] them. I'll go on Facebook. I'll do this,
[52:38] that, and the other. I'll straighten it
[52:40] out. You're fixing to make a mess out of
[52:42] it. It's what you're fixing to do. Now,
[52:43] I'll tell you what you're doing. You're
[52:45] taking it out of God's hands and putting
[52:47] it in your own hands and trying to
[52:48] settle it. I figure he knows a whole lot
[52:51] better how to settle issues than I do. I
[52:53] just wish some of y'all would learn this
[52:55] now.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; It'll make you a lot better Christian.
[52:58] Help you sleep a lot better at night
[52:59] time. Who knows, you might even make the
[53:01] rapture, too, which is always a plus.
[53:05] Who when he was reviled, reviled not
[53:07] again. When he suffered, he threatened
[53:10] not. Notice this, but committed
[53:14] committed
[53:16] himself
[53:18] to him that judgeth
[53:20] righteously. Now watch what he done. He
[53:23] so succumbed to the ideology of a
[53:26] servant into the role of the spirit of
[53:29] God. Remember Isaiah said, "Behold my
[53:31] servant." So this is what the humanity
[53:34] of the Lord Jesus was. The sunship was
[53:36] just simply the humanity of God. So in
[53:39] the form of humanity, the logos took on
[53:42] sunship and he had to strip himself of
[53:47] many of the great attributes of deity.
[53:50] So he had to learn how to commit himself
[53:55] which had never been done before. He
[53:57] never had to do that when he was forming
[53:59] the worlds. He never had to do that when
[54:01] he created the stars. But in the form of
[54:04] sunship, humanity, he had to submit
[54:08] himself. Why? For you. For me. He would
[54:12] give us the example. Children, I'm going
[54:14] to do it first. I'm going to do it. Then
[54:17] when I do it, you walk in my footsteps.
[54:20] I'm going to show you how to submit to
[54:24] him who judges righteously. So what do I
[54:28] submit, brother Donnie? my opinion, your
[54:30] attitude, your rights to fight back,
[54:33] your rights to get even, your right to
[54:36] walk up to somebody before church or
[54:38] after church. I'm going to give them a
[54:39] piece of my mind. Don't do that. Commit
[54:42] the situation to God. Come on, somebody
[54:45] say, "Amen."
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Notice how the Lord Jesus now, he
[54:50] threatened not, but committed himself to
[54:54] him that judgeth righteously. And the
[54:56] word committed is to give into the hands
[55:00] of another. To give over
[55:03] into one's power or use.
[55:08] CAN YOU IMAGINE? NOW HE HAD THE POWER.
[55:10] HE COULD HAVE CALLED AND THEY SAID ONE
[55:12] WORD. The angels of God could have
[55:14] smoked him right there. But instead of
[55:16] using that power, he said, "Nope, I'm
[55:18] not going to do it. I'm I'm going to be
[55:21] an example for Donnie.
[55:23] I'm going to be an example
[55:26] for Jim, Fred, Betty, Susie, Janet. I'm
[55:30] going to be an example. I want to I want
[55:32] to write have this written about my life
[55:34] so they can see they won't have all this
[55:37] power the way I have access to it. But I
[55:40] want them to hear this preached over and
[55:43] over again. So by this word, I'll be
[55:46] able to conform them. Even though
[55:49] they'll be held captive in that flesh
[55:51] body, they'll every day become more and
[55:54] more and more like me. And they'll
[55:57] realize that when they can learn to
[56:00] commit theirel, it's not a sign of
[56:02] weakness.
[56:04] It's actually a sign of godliness
[56:08] &gt;&gt; and greatness.
[56:10] Now, how many of us relate to that in
[56:13] that way?
[56:15] Doesn't it look weak WHENEVER SOMEONE
[56:18] WOULD SAY SOMETHING AGAINST US? Doesn't
[56:20] it look weak for us not to defend
[56:22] oursel? Doesn't it look weak that if
[56:26] some people will think less of me? Who
[56:28] cares about that? As long as he thinks
[56:30] great about me, what do I care what
[56:32] other folks say? Now, can you imagine
[56:35] the greatness is actually being able to
[56:38] commit? but committed himself to him
[56:42] that judgeth righteously.
[56:45] I want you to notice that as we endeavor
[56:49] by the grace of God to become conformed
[56:53] more and more into the image of his son,
[56:57] the godliness attributes
[57:00] which will be minimized by the majority
[57:04] of Christendom. We realize that and
[57:06] they'll say, "Oh, it can never be
[57:07] attained to. It can never be had. Nobody
[57:08] ever wants it's not deep. It's not
[57:10] really that important. And they'll kind
[57:12] of put it in that type of a category.
[57:14] But the elect of God, they look at it
[57:16] totally different. Notice in Matthew
[57:18] 5:44, he says, "I say unto you, love
[57:20] your enemies, bless them that curse you,
[57:24] do good to them that hate you, and pray
[57:28] for them which despitefully
[57:30] use you, and persecute you." Now
[57:34] remember, he is advising his disciples
[57:37] to do what he himself has already been
[57:41] doing, but they're going to see more of
[57:43] a fulfillment of this when he goes to
[57:46] the cross.
[57:48] For there
[57:50] they will crucify him and they will not
[57:52] even ask for forgiveness.
[57:55] But he prays for their forgiveness
[57:56] anyway.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Can we do that?
[58:04] Can we forgive people
[58:06] even when they don't ask for
[58:08] forgiveness? I don't mind telling you
[58:09] there's an element about all this I
[58:11] don't understand. If I do wrong, God
[58:14] won't let me get by with it.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; I got to apologize. I got to make it
[58:18] right.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; But there's other Christians, they can
[58:21] do this and that and the other and
[58:23] they'll go right on like it never
[58:25] happened. And I don't understand that.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Anybody else don't understand that? I
[58:30] don't understand it. No, I don't. But
[58:32] you know what? I'm not waiting on them
[58:35] if they've trespassed against me for
[58:38] them to come and and do it. Because some
[58:41] people, it's just like they cannot do
[58:43] it. They just cannot admit that they're
[58:47] wrong.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; They just have a awful, awful time of
[58:52] admitting that they're wrong or that
[58:53] they've done wrong. So, I guess this is
[58:56] what worries me. If I think if I'm
[59:00] waiting on them for me to forgive them,
[59:02] it may never happen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; So, I figure I better go ahead and do
[59:06] it. That way, I'll be clear cuz I don't
[59:09] want them holding me back.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Anybody know what I'm talking about? So,
[59:13] why should I wait? Why should you wait?
[59:15] Well, I've had this sure in my heart.
[59:17] I'm waiting for him to come and ask me.
[59:19] I'm waiting for her to come and ask me.
[59:21] And did Jesus do that?
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Come on, admit it. It's our ways.
[59:27] And it gives us a little right to hold
[59:29] on to a grudge.
[59:31] Preach, brother Donnie.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOW WATCH. SO THE LORD JESUS has
[59:38] actually done this and will continue to
[59:41] do so. And he gives us these examples
[59:44] that we might be able to walk in his
[59:46] footsteps. Notice in Romans Romans 5:10.
[59:49] For if when we were enemies,
[59:55] we were reconciled to God by the death
[59:58] of his son, much more being reconciled,
[1:00:00] we shall be saved
[1:00:03] by his life.
[1:00:06] So if we cannot love our enemies, that
[1:00:08] means God cannot love us
[1:00:12] cuz we were his enemies.
[1:00:15] You see, when he tells us to do this,
[1:00:18] he's telling us, "Children,
[1:00:21] be like me.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; This is godliness.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Love
[1:00:28] your enemies."
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Because I loved you.
[1:00:33] And you know what he did? I was born an
[1:00:36] enemy. I didn't realize it. Of course,
[1:00:39] most of you didn't. I I didn't know I
[1:00:40] was an enemy of of God. I didn't know I
[1:00:42] was an enemy of his kingdom.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; But he loved me so much as his enemy. He
[1:00:50] wanted me to be a part of his kingdom.
[1:00:54] So his love transformed me from being
[1:00:58] born an enemy to being reborn a friend.
[1:01:04] Praise be to God. SO THEN HE TELLS US,
[1:01:07] "NOW CHILDREN, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO, I
[1:01:10] want you to act LIKE ME BECAUSE I LOVED
[1:01:15] you when you were my enemies and you're
[1:01:17] no longer my enemies because my love
[1:01:20] broke that and brought you into sunship,
[1:01:24] friendship with me. Now I want you to
[1:01:27] show the world and I'm going to let you
[1:01:30] be tried the way I was. not in the same
[1:01:32] measure, but it'll be certain aspects of
[1:01:35] my walk. And I will let you be tried in
[1:01:37] that way. And I'm going to let you be
[1:01:39] hated. I'm going to let you be
[1:01:40] persecuted. And sometimes it'll be
[1:01:43] people that you love so much. And
[1:01:44] they'll hurt you so deeply. And I'm
[1:01:47] going to let you go that way. So my love
[1:01:50] continue to be extended in the same way
[1:01:54] in human flesh, except this time it
[1:01:56] won't be my flesh, but it'll be yours.
[1:02:00] And some people will actually be turned
[1:02:04] from being your enemies to being your
[1:02:06] friends because you let me love them
[1:02:09] through you and I will destroy that hold
[1:02:14] of that hatred they have on them.
[1:02:17] Lord Jesus, Colossians 1 21. And ye that
[1:02:22] were sometime alienated and enemies in
[1:02:26] your mind by wicked works, yet now hast
[1:02:31] he reconciled. Now look at what a degree
[1:02:34] of love this is. This love is a is a
[1:02:37] mark of maturity,
[1:02:40] proving that we're not just little bitty
[1:02:42] tiny children in the kingdom of God, but
[1:02:47] we're growing up.
[1:02:51] So, we're not, OH, WE'RE CHILDREN OF
[1:02:53] GOD. WE'RE CHILDREN of God. That's all
[1:02:55] well and good, but are we maturing or
[1:02:58] are we still little three-year-olds?
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Are we little teenagers?
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Any of you that's had
[1:03:06] teenagers, God help you.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Well, that's the way a lot of Christians
[1:03:11] are. Some of them two year olds, some of
[1:03:13] them's three year olds. You know, they
[1:03:15] go through that whatever age it is. You
[1:03:17] parents, you know, you had a had a name
[1:03:19] for every bit of it. What age they're
[1:03:21] in? Terrible twos. I've had plenty of
[1:03:23] those church members that were in their
[1:03:25] terrible twos for 58 years.
[1:03:30] And then they go up into the pre-teen
[1:03:32] and the adolescence. And then they
[1:03:34] become a teenager. Then all of a sudden
[1:03:37] they know everything there is to know
[1:03:39] about everything.
[1:03:41] Nobody can tell them anything different.
[1:03:43] Even Almighty God himself. Well, you
[1:03:46] know, we've got the same thing in
[1:03:47] church. We got spiritual teenagers and
[1:03:50] they know absolutely everything. I don't
[1:03:52] need the preacher to tell me nothing.
[1:03:54] Well, you're a spiritual teenager. But I
[1:03:58] believe that God is not coming. And the
[1:04:01] rapture is not going to be for a little
[1:04:03] 2-year-old infant bride to marry and be
[1:04:08] consummated with our Lord Jesus. He's
[1:04:10] going to marry and take unto himself and
[1:04:14] consummate this wedding with who? An
[1:04:16] adult woman. So, how are we going to be
[1:04:19] adult? Just because we know how many
[1:04:21] times brother Brandham said the word
[1:04:22] seven thunders. We're going to know how
[1:04:24] many times he said the word, you know,
[1:04:26] seven seals. It'll be by the
[1:04:28] manifestation of the person of Christ
[1:04:30] revealing himself in the full stature of
[1:04:33] every individual. Not just the pastor,
[1:04:36] not the deacons, not the trustees, but
[1:04:39] leoty as well.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my God help us. So it's a sign of the
[1:04:44] mark of maturity. And what is it? It's
[1:04:48] godlike.
[1:04:50] To love like this is godlike. Look in
[1:04:54] verse 44. But I say unto you again, love
[1:04:57] your enemies, bless them which curse
[1:04:59] you, and do good to them that hate you,
[1:05:01] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:05:03] you, and persecute you. So the verb
[1:05:05] here, persecute, generally refers to
[1:05:08] religious persecution. So you know what
[1:05:10] that means? As a bride of Christ, we're
[1:05:12] going to suffer an element of religious
[1:05:14] persecution. Now, look, we're not going
[1:05:16] through the tribulation period. Thank
[1:05:17] God for that. But where does a lot of
[1:05:20] our persecution come from as far as
[1:05:23] following the message of the hour? A lot
[1:05:25] of it comes, of course, in form of
[1:05:26] people that sit among us. But others, it
[1:05:28] comes from uninformed people that don't
[1:05:32] really know what we believe and they
[1:05:33] think we're a cult, some kind of weird
[1:05:35] bunch of people cuz they never really
[1:05:36] ask us theirel. They take everybody
[1:05:38] else's word for it. So Jesus says that
[1:05:41] we're going to be persecuted. But
[1:05:44] notice, I love this in verse 45. That
[1:05:47] you may be the children of your father
[1:05:50] which is in heaven. For he maketh his
[1:05:52] son to rise on the evil and on the good.
[1:05:55] Now he said, "The reason I want you to
[1:05:57] be like this is because this will be one
[1:06:01] definite sign and evidence that you are
[1:06:05] my children because you can love like
[1:06:09] me."
[1:06:12] So if you're a white man, you'll have no
[1:06:14] problem loving a black man.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; And if you're a black man, you'll have
[1:06:18] no problem loving a white man. If you're
[1:06:20] an American, you'll have no problem
[1:06:22] loving a Chinese.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; You might not love all the stuff they
[1:06:26] make there, but you get mad at all that
[1:06:28] junk.
[1:06:31] You see, THE LORD JESUS DOES NOT LOVE A
[1:06:34] CERTAIN color of people and they say, "I
[1:06:36] I don't love this other color near as
[1:06:38] much." The true love of God in our
[1:06:40] hearts will love like he loves. Come on,
[1:06:43] somebody.
[1:06:45] Oh my. You see, you will be the children
[1:06:48] of your father. And the declaration is
[1:06:50] by the Lord Jesus himself that you may
[1:06:54] be the children of your father. So you
[1:06:57] see one of the great divine things that
[1:07:00] God wants to attribute to his people is
[1:07:03] that in this position of sunship and
[1:07:06] daughtership that our conformity to the
[1:07:10] divine nature is being reflected by
[1:07:13] divine behavior in our human life right
[1:07:16] now. Do you understand what a miracle
[1:07:20] that is? Some of you were born with a
[1:07:23] temper. You would fight THE DEVIL
[1:07:25] HIMSELF.
[1:07:27] SOME of you would slap the devil up the
[1:07:29] side of the head before you realized who
[1:07:31] he was. I mean, you would cuss. You
[1:07:33] would do this and that and the other.
[1:07:35] And the Lord got a hold to you and
[1:07:37] changed you and made you a different
[1:07:39] person. Praise the Lord. Some of you
[1:07:41] were this way and that way. And the
[1:07:43] devil himself probably looked at some of
[1:07:45] you and said, "They're even too hopeless
[1:07:47] for hell. I'm not sure I even want them
[1:07:49] down there. Is there another place we
[1:07:51] can send them?" And what DID GOD DO? GOD
[1:07:54] GOT A HOLD TO YOUR HEART AND changed
[1:07:56] your nature and then God started that
[1:07:59] slow process of taking out this and
[1:08:02] taking out that. Look friends, it's
[1:08:04] absolutely marvelous what the new birth
[1:08:07] can do. And it does not take 45 years
[1:08:09] for the new birth to consummate and
[1:08:12] change the nature that we're born in.
[1:08:14] That is an absolute miracle that happens
[1:08:16] in an instant. But you're just getting
[1:08:19] started then. Then you're on your
[1:08:21] journey. All my people just preach the
[1:08:24] cross, the cross, the cross. I love the
[1:08:26] cross, but the cross made a way for me
[1:08:29] to come into disciplehip.
[1:08:32] You've got to preach more than the cross
[1:08:34] if you're ever going to go in the
[1:08:35] rapture. Come on, somebody. And what do
[1:08:38] we believe? We believe in the blood of
[1:08:40] the Lord Jesus. We believe in the cross,
[1:08:43] but we believe the cross was simply that
[1:08:45] breach where the lamb of God gave his
[1:08:48] life that we might be able to come back
[1:08:50] into the presence of God and start
[1:08:52] molding and shaping and making us into
[1:08:56] his image. Thank God. Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; ONE GREAT EVIDENCE THAT WE can know that
[1:09:02] we are partakers of the divine nature is
[1:09:06] when that cry within our soul is to be
[1:09:10] transformed into his great image. You
[1:09:13] see, WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE God in wisdom
[1:09:17] or in power. That was part of what got
[1:09:21] man in trouble in the Garden of Eden.
[1:09:23] Remember Satan's words? Uh did you do
[1:09:26] this? and you'll BE LIKE GOD. WHAT'S HE
[1:09:29] offering them? An element of godship, an
[1:09:33] element into the godhead, and trying to
[1:09:36] blind them from what they already had.
[1:09:38] Don't you see what man wants today? Man
[1:09:40] wants to be the god of his own life.
[1:09:43] Self-power, selfie this, selfie that.
[1:09:47] The devil was the first one to be hung
[1:09:49] up on selfies.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; I'll do this and I'll do that. Don't you
[1:09:53] get caught up in that trap of the devil.
[1:09:55] Amen. Somebody say amen with me.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Now notice God wants us to crucify
[1:10:00] oursel and it was Satan playing this
[1:10:03] trick upon Eve. Eve bringing it to Adam.
[1:10:06] But in striving to be like him. We know
[1:10:10] we cannot be like him in divine mercy
[1:10:12] and all that that he is. But he wants us
[1:10:14] to be able to love the way he loved and
[1:10:18] do what no ordinary human could ever do.
[1:10:21] to be able to forgive beyond our own
[1:10:24] human capability.
[1:10:26] You see the word perfect whenever Jesus
[1:10:29] talks about it and he mentions that we
[1:10:32] might be perfect before God. The word
[1:10:35] perfect does not mean sinless perfect
[1:10:38] but it suggests completeness and
[1:10:42] maturity and nothing lacking. In other
[1:10:44] words, we've grown up into that spot.
[1:10:47] Notice in verse 46, he says, "If you
[1:10:50] love them which love you, what reward
[1:10:53] have you? Do not even the publicans the
[1:10:57] same? And if you salute your brethren,
[1:11:01] now that ain't a military salute, but
[1:11:03] look at the meaning of the word. It
[1:11:05] means greet or embrace,
[1:11:08] bid welcome, or wish well to."
[1:11:13] So, is there anybody sitting in the
[1:11:15] church today that if you met them
[1:11:16] oneon-one outside the door there that
[1:11:19] you couldn't bid them welcome?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Or would you turn your head and walk
[1:11:24] away?
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; You're acting like a sinner
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; and a publican.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Don't get mad at me. These are the words
[1:11:35] of Jesus. I'm just the mailman.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, notice what he said.
[1:11:40] If you salute your brethren only, what
[1:11:43] do you more than others? Do not even the
[1:11:45] publicans do so. SO IF WE LET SOMETHING
[1:11:49] GET IN OUR HEART against our brothers
[1:11:51] and sisters or family members or friends
[1:11:53] or whatever it is, and because I ain't
[1:11:55] having nothing to do with that, I won't
[1:11:56] speak to them. I'll tell you one thing,
[1:11:58] shame on us. And we claim we're full of
[1:12:01] the Holy Ghost and ready for the
[1:12:03] rapture. Oh my goodness.
[1:12:06] Notice in verse 48, be ye therefore
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; perfect
[1:12:15] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:12:17] is perfect. AND NOW WHERE DOES ALL THIS
[1:12:19] COME FROM that Jesus talks about raising
[1:12:22] the dead, casting out devils, healing
[1:12:24] the sick, laying hands on the lepers.
[1:12:25] No, no, he he's not saying perfect comes
[1:12:29] by those signs. And we believe in those
[1:12:31] signs.
[1:12:33] But he says, "What will make you
[1:12:35] complete
[1:12:37] is when you love the way I love."
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. AND GOD'S LOVE IS
[1:12:45] complete
[1:12:47] in that the Bible says, "For God so
[1:12:49] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:12:52] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:12:55] him. Whosoever believeth in him should
[1:12:58] not perish but have everlasting life.
[1:13:00] For God sent not his son into the
[1:13:03] world." The world cosmos world order,
[1:13:06] not bride, world.
[1:13:09] For God sent not his son into the world
[1:13:11] to condemn the world, but that the world
[1:13:14] through him might be saved. Do you
[1:13:15] understand? He reached beyond the lamb's
[1:13:18] book of life and let mercy spill over
[1:13:21] into the book of life and said to many,
[1:13:25] many millions and billions of you OF YOU
[1:13:28] PEOPLE, YOU'RE not even of my genos, MY
[1:13:31] KIND. YOU'RE NOT MY ELECT.
[1:13:35] But I'll tell you what I'll do.
[1:13:38] I'll let you be saved.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I'LL LET YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; If you want it,
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; all you have to do is accept my
[1:13:54] perpetuation.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; And we become so full of sectarianism.
[1:14:03] Anybody know what that word means?
[1:14:05] Sectarianism.
[1:14:07] Brother Rand mentions it through the
[1:14:09] message. Then of course the message was
[1:14:12] in its infancy and the sectarianism had
[1:14:15] not grown to the stage it is now. But
[1:14:18] it's simply a compound word that takes
[1:14:21] the word sect which you know what a sect
[1:14:23] would be and then it becomes either an
[1:14:25] ideology or theology or a group or it
[1:14:29] can be a group of churches and they're
[1:14:31] so set in their own little ideology that
[1:14:35] they cut off fellowship from other
[1:14:38] people. Sectarianism
[1:14:40] and our message is full of it. Come on
[1:14:43] somebody say amen. And if we're not
[1:14:46] careful, sectarianism will be inside of
[1:14:48] our own church. So we got this little
[1:14:50] sect and that little sect and well they
[1:14:52] don't, you know, we're on the Baptist
[1:14:53] side of the church. So we don't say amen
[1:14:55] very much. And then this is the
[1:14:56] Methodist side here. And then this over
[1:14:58] here is kind of the Pentecostal side.
[1:15:00] And that over is we're still trying to
[1:15:02] define if they're unitarian or Lutheran.
[1:15:04] We're trying to define what everybody
[1:15:05] are. Well, we believe in this and we
[1:15:08] believe in that. And then we become so
[1:15:10] divisive among ourselves that we can't
[1:15:13] even love one another. Are are are we
[1:15:14] going to be divided that way when we go
[1:15:16] into the paradise of God, friends?
[1:15:20] THAT'S NOT COMPLETE LOVE. OH, BROTHER
[1:15:22] DONNIE, HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH IT? HOW WE
[1:15:24] KNOW YOU GO OUT AND PREACH FOR PREACHERS
[1:15:26] you don't agree with. I sure do. I go
[1:15:28] out and preach for many I do not agree
[1:15:30] with, but I love them. And I don't
[1:15:34] figure being mean to anybody is going to
[1:15:36] help me or them.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:42] Oh my. YOU SEE, THE DESIRE FOR THE CHILD
[1:15:45] OF God should be to so thrive and hunger
[1:15:50] and thirst to be in God's mature love.
[1:15:55] And at the same time, now remember what
[1:15:58] Jesus said when we was looking at this a
[1:15:59] week or so ago about for us to be as
[1:16:02] wise as serpents and as harmless as
[1:16:05] doves. Let me pick this up again. That
[1:16:08] he wants us to be harmless. Now, he
[1:16:11] likened us to a dove. Read with me in
[1:16:14] Leviticus 12:6. AND THE DOVE WAS SO pure
[1:16:19] in the eyes of God that he would accept
[1:16:23] it as a sin offering.
[1:16:27] Think of it that the dove, not the
[1:16:29] eagle.
[1:16:31] Now, we all admire the eagle and we love
[1:16:33] the eagle. Yes, the eagle has a great
[1:16:35] place in our message, but it's not the
[1:16:37] only bird that does.
[1:16:40] The dove has a great place as well. Now,
[1:16:43] I want you to notice a scavenger or a
[1:16:46] mighty eagle, no species of the eagles,
[1:16:49] out of all of them, could be accepted as
[1:16:52] a sin offering. And when the days of her
[1:16:55] purifying are fulfilled for a son or for
[1:16:58] a daughter, then shall she shall bring a
[1:17:00] lamb of the first year for a burnt
[1:17:03] offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle
[1:17:06] dove for a sin offering unto the door to
[1:17:10] the tabernacle of the congregation under
[1:17:13] the priest. Now notice again in Hebrews
[1:17:15] chapter 7 26. For such a high priest
[1:17:18] became us who is holy, harmless,
[1:17:22] undefiled, separate from sinners, made
[1:17:26] higher than the heavens. So harmless is
[1:17:29] not injuring to anyone. Now he did no
[1:17:33] one wrong to their name or to their
[1:17:36] person or to their property.
[1:17:41] I say harmless.
[1:17:43] So if it would be in your power, your
[1:17:46] ability to tell something on someone and
[1:17:50] it could be true
[1:17:53] and it would render you the power to
[1:17:57] mark their character and you say, "I'm
[1:18:00] simply telling the truth."
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; What would you do with that truth?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Y'all must have left your ameners at
[1:18:13] home today.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Well, if you brought your Omir, I I'll
[1:18:17] take that for a while if you want to say
[1:18:19] oh me.
[1:18:21] YOU SEE, GOD GOD knew
[1:18:25] God knew this would be impossible
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; for human beings to do.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; This is why he asked preachers to preach
[1:18:32] it so high. AND YOU SAY, "LORD HAVE
[1:18:34] MERCY. I CAN NEVER DO IT." Praise the
[1:18:36] Lord. That means my preaching worked
[1:18:38] this morning.
[1:18:40] That's where I want you to be. I want
[1:18:42] every one of you when you walk OUT OF
[1:18:44] HERE TO REALIZE THIS IS TOTALLY
[1:18:46] IMPOSSIBLE for me.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; That way it'll get your eyes off of
[1:18:49] yourself
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; and it'll turn your eyes where they need
[1:18:52] to be on the Lord Jesus.
[1:18:56] Notice in Philippians 2 that Paul goes
[1:18:58] on to say that you may be blameless and
[1:19:00] harmless, the sons of God without rebuke
[1:19:03] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[1:19:06] nation among whom you shine as lights in
[1:19:09] the world. NOW, WILL WE HURT ONE
[1:19:11] ANOTHER?
[1:19:12] I hate to say it, but we will.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; We will.
[1:19:18] But the difference between someone who
[1:19:20] really is a son or daughter of God and
[1:19:23] wants to walk in this image of the Lord
[1:19:25] Jesus is when they realize they've hurt
[1:19:28] someone, they will make it right.
[1:19:37] Look at Stephen. Acts 7.
[1:19:42] He kneel down and cried with a loud
[1:19:44] voice,"Lord,
[1:19:48] lay not this sin
[1:19:51] to their charge."
[1:19:54] And when he had said this,
[1:19:59] he fell
[1:20:01] asleep.
[1:20:03] What last words of glory to say
[1:20:09] from a redeemed
[1:20:11] human being.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; You imagine the very nature. You see
[1:20:16] what this was doing, church? This was
[1:20:18] showing Peter, James, John, this man
[1:20:22] here, the life, THE DIVINE nature
[1:20:26] had come back on the day of Pentecost.
[1:20:29] And now that divine nature was coming
[1:20:32] out of the deacon's mouth. Remember this
[1:20:35] was a deacon.
[1:20:38] THEY HAD FALSELY CHARGED HIM. THEY
[1:20:40] FALSELY accused him. AND THEY DONE ALL
[1:20:42] THESE HORRIBLE THINGS. AND THE LAST
[1:20:44] words to come out of his MOUTH WAS NOT,
[1:20:47] "HOW DAMN YOU TO HELL.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL. I PRAY
[1:20:51] YOU'LL BURN IN HELL."
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:20:56] NO.
[1:20:59] I don't understand.
[1:21:03] I I I don't I don't understand how some
[1:21:05] people
[1:21:08] when you do something against them or
[1:21:09] you offend them somehow
[1:21:12] and they're sitting around waiting for
[1:21:14] bad things to happen to you
[1:21:20] and they keep up with you just so they
[1:21:21] can keep a record of, you know, God's
[1:21:24] getting you back and punishing you for
[1:21:25] this and punishing you for that. I don't
[1:21:28] I don't understand.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong with that heart,
[1:21:31] friends. I'll tell you that right now.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Are are bad things going to happen to
[1:21:36] us? They sure are.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Are they? How many have bad things to
[1:21:41] happen to you or your family, people
[1:21:42] that you love? Of course. Does that mean
[1:21:45] that God's getting back at you because
[1:21:47] you done this or that or the other? Lord
[1:21:49] have mercy. Can you imagine if God would
[1:21:52] let bad things happen to us because of
[1:21:54] all we've done to him? I wouldn't even
[1:21:56] exist today. And I'm gonna go ahead and
[1:21:57] say it for the rest of you. None of you
[1:21:59] would either.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; But what is it that you can see that
[1:22:05] people are missing something? I'm
[1:22:07] talking about people in our own ranks.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE MISSING SOMETHING
[1:22:13] THAT THEY'RE WAITING WITH ANTICIPATION
[1:22:16] FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TO YOU, BROTHER
[1:22:18] J. D. SO THEY CAN SAY, "I KNEW IT. I
[1:22:20] KNEW IT. I KNEW GOD WOULD GET HIM.
[1:22:28] I can see him as he sets outside that
[1:22:31] cave
[1:22:34] five miles outside of Jerusalem.
[1:22:39] And he sees them one by one.
[1:22:42] They're being led captive.
[1:22:46] He sees his prophecy being fulfilled.
[1:22:50] The man's name is Jeremiah.
[1:22:55] He sees thousands of his brothers
[1:22:57] walking before him,
[1:23:00] bound.
[1:23:01] Some of them their eyes are gouged out.
[1:23:05] Some of them, the women, they have blood
[1:23:07] running down their legs because them
[1:23:08] soldiers had raped them.
[1:23:13] But I don't see a man sitting there.
[1:23:21] But I see chapter one of the book called
[1:23:24] Lamentations
[1:23:27] reflects a man who's weeping
[1:23:30] because his prophecy
[1:23:33] had to happen.
[1:23:40] Help us, Lord.
[1:23:44] You see this dove like meekness
[1:23:47] is the best jewel of ornamentation
[1:23:52] that we can have. This is what meekness
[1:23:54] does. Anger disfigures.
[1:23:58] Have you ever noticed people when they
[1:24:00] get really mad? I mean really mad.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; You ever notice how that it brings
[1:24:07] contorted,
[1:24:08] twisted
[1:24:10] expressions?
[1:24:12] on a human's face.
[1:24:15] Now, I know some of you is going to sit
[1:24:16] there and not move a muscle, you're
[1:24:18] going to act like that don't happen in
[1:24:19] your house.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; All right, you go ahead and act that way
[1:24:23] if you want to.
[1:24:25] How many knows what I'm talking about?
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; When people get angry or sometime or
[1:24:30] another you've got angry, I mean, back
[1:24:32] 185 years ago, and of course, you don't
[1:24:34] do that anymore. HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
[1:24:36] WHAT IT DOES TO YOU?
[1:24:39] It reflects on your face
[1:24:43] and that anger will contort and and
[1:24:46] twist and
[1:24:49] I read people. I do I mean I have to
[1:24:51] talk to thousands of people and have
[1:24:52] through the years. So I I watch people
[1:24:55] and a few times it saved me from getting
[1:24:57] my head hit, you know, by watching them
[1:25:00] uh in my office after church.
[1:25:05] And if they've got a habit and their
[1:25:07] little their upper lip will start
[1:25:09] quivering and it'll start pulling up or
[1:25:13] their eyes will start going back and
[1:25:14] forth back and forth. Certain things
[1:25:17] that it does. Now it's the emotion on
[1:25:19] the inside but they can't hide it from
[1:25:22] the outside.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Well, if that has that kind of an
[1:25:26] expression, what about the gentleness of
[1:25:29] the love of God? Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; You see, the dove is this emblem of
[1:25:36] purity and it just can't stand this this
[1:25:40] anger. And remember, brother Random used
[1:25:42] the the symbolism of whenever we would
[1:25:46] hear gossip or whenever we would become
[1:25:49] bitter that that dove would just fly out
[1:25:52] and fly away.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; And remember, your soul is not unsealed.
[1:25:58] You've not broken that seal and you've
[1:26:00] lost the Holy Ghost,
[1:26:03] but it's simply as Paul said in
[1:26:04] Ephesians 4:30, "Grieve not the Holy
[1:26:08] Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed."
[1:26:11] See, he's writing to Holy Ghost fil
[1:26:13] people. Grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:26:15] God. How many's ever grieved the spirit
[1:26:17] of God? That's right.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Several years ago at the old church,
[1:26:26] we'd had a a fall fest. We had service
[1:26:30] on Saturday night. And I was going to
[1:26:32] preach and whenever I came out, there
[1:26:34] was quite a crowd of people there,
[1:26:35] visitors. And so I just looked across
[1:26:38] the crowd. And I just I just said what I
[1:26:41] felt to my heart, what I you know, the
[1:26:44] way I felt about it. I said, "I hope our
[1:26:47] church never gets this big."
[1:26:50] And as soon
[1:26:53] as I said that,
[1:26:55] I knew I had offended him.
[1:27:00] I felt the awful thing
[1:27:04] strike me
[1:27:07] like I was the boss and what I had to
[1:27:09] say mattered.
[1:27:14] It was everything I could do to go ahead
[1:27:16] and preach
[1:27:18] because I knew he did not like what I
[1:27:21] said.
[1:27:24] And I've asked him, I couldn't tell you
[1:27:26] how many times, please forgive me.
[1:27:29] I'll never say that again. That ain't my
[1:27:32] place. It ain't for me to say.
[1:27:37] How many has had similar things happen
[1:27:38] to you as believers that you just
[1:27:40] grieve? So that mean I need to go up to
[1:27:42] the altar and get saved? I felt like it.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; I guess it'd been really odd if I just
[1:27:47] got up and say, "You know what, saints?
[1:27:48] I need to get saved tonight." The Lord
[1:27:50] probably some of y'all just passed out
[1:27:51] and said, "Lord have mercy. Our pastor
[1:27:52] ain't even saved."
[1:27:55] But when you grieve him,
[1:27:58] it breaks your heart because of what you
[1:28:00] feel it does.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; So what happened to me that night? It
[1:28:05] wasn't that I broke the seal, but I
[1:28:07] grieved him. and that gentleness
[1:28:09] and I had to labor and stand there and
[1:28:11] preach and he was faithful because of
[1:28:14] the people's sake cuz I felt like
[1:28:16] folding up my Bible and going back into
[1:28:18] the office and getting down on my knees
[1:28:20] and praying and asking him to forgive
[1:28:22] me. But you know what? I'm so glad that
[1:28:25] I have got something inside of me that
[1:28:27] when I do wrong, I can still be
[1:28:30] convicted.
[1:28:32] I'm so glad. Aren't you glad today that
[1:28:34] when you do wrong or say wrong or
[1:28:37] misbehave?
[1:28:39] IT DON'T MEAN YOU AIN'T GOT THE HOLY
[1:28:41] GHOST, IT MEANS YOU JUST GRIEVED him and
[1:28:43] you hurt his feelings and you offended
[1:28:46] him.
[1:28:51] Matthew 5:8,
[1:28:54] "Blessed
[1:28:56] are the pure in heart,
[1:29:00] for they
[1:29:02] shall see God."
[1:29:07] And remember this is the mount, his
[1:29:11] great sermon of the biatitudes.
[1:29:14] Blessed are the pure.
[1:29:17] Look with me at this word. Cather, clean
[1:29:21] physically purified by fire in a
[1:29:24] similitude
[1:29:26] like a vine cleansed by pruning and so
[1:29:31] fitted to bear fruit. Esthically free
[1:29:33] from corrupt desire,
[1:29:37] from sin and guilt, free from every ad
[1:29:40] mixture
[1:29:42] of what is false,
[1:29:45] sincere, genuine,
[1:29:47] blameless, innocent,
[1:29:51] unstained,
[1:29:53] with guilt
[1:29:55] of anything.
[1:29:58] Blessed are the pure in heart,
[1:30:02] for they shall see God.
[1:30:05] First Timothy 1:5. Now the end of the
[1:30:08] commandment is charity,
[1:30:11] out of a pure heart,
[1:30:14] and of a good conscience, and faith
[1:30:17] unfeigned. 1 Timothy 5:22, "Lay hands
[1:30:21] suddenly on no man, neither be partaker
[1:30:23] of other men's sins.
[1:30:26] Keep thyself
[1:30:29] pure.
[1:30:32] And remember, after the Lord Jesus
[1:30:34] changes our nature, there is an element
[1:30:38] of sanctification
[1:30:40] that the spirit of God will not do.
[1:30:43] It's up to us to do.
[1:30:49] Modern day Christianity has no walls,
[1:30:52] has no boundaries,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; has no limitations.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; So everything to them is pure, I guess.
[1:31:01] Notice again 2 Timothy 2:22.
[1:31:05] Flee also youthful lust, but follow
[1:31:08] righteousness, faith, charity, peace
[1:31:12] with them that call on the Lord out of a
[1:31:16] pure heart. 1 Peter 1:22, "Seeing that
[1:31:20] you have purified your souls in obeying
[1:31:22] the truth through the spirit unto
[1:31:24] unfeign love of the brethren, see that
[1:31:27] ye love one another with a pure heart
[1:31:32] fervently." Now, don't raise your hands,
[1:31:34] but I wonder how many of all these
[1:31:35] hundreds of people here today
[1:31:39] have a pure heart.
[1:31:44] Pure heart.
[1:31:50] Second Peter 3:1, the second epistle,
[1:31:52] beloved, I now write unto you AND BOAST
[1:31:55] WHICH I STIR UP YOUR pure minds
[1:32:01] by the way of remembrance. So a person
[1:32:04] can have a pure heart and then keep a
[1:32:07] pure mind. How in the world you going to
[1:32:09] do that?
[1:32:11] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
[1:32:13] things are holy, whatsoever things are
[1:32:15] just, whatsoever things are faithful,
[1:32:17] whatsoever things of a good report,
[1:32:19] think on these things, it helps purify
[1:32:22] your mind.
[1:32:24] Praise the Lord. First John 3:2,
[1:32:27] beloved, now are we the sons of God, and
[1:32:30] it does not yet appear what we shall be,
[1:32:32] but we know that when he shall appear,
[1:32:34] we shall be like him, for we shall see
[1:32:36] him as he is. And every man that hath
[1:32:40] this hope in him
[1:32:43] purifieth
[1:32:45] himself
[1:32:49] even as he
[1:32:51] is pure. Now you see friends this is the
[1:32:53] part that modern day Christendom wants
[1:32:57] nothing to do with. They want Jesus to
[1:33:00] do it all. Jesus save them. Jesus
[1:33:02] cleanse them. Jesus make them ready for
[1:33:04] heaven. And they go ahead and just do
[1:33:06] whatever they are. And they'll just sing
[1:33:08] these songs all the time. Oh, I'm still
[1:33:10] just an old sinner saved by grace. So,
[1:33:13] I'm still sinner. I'm still running
[1:33:15] around. I'm still committing adultery,
[1:33:17] but I'm saved by grace now. Oh, okay.
[1:33:19] So, you was a sinner and done that. You
[1:33:21] was going to hell. Yeah, that's right.
[1:33:22] Then I got saved by grace and I'm still
[1:33:24] doing the same thing and now I'm going
[1:33:25] to heaven. That's crazy.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; I SAID, "THAT'S CRAZY.
[1:33:30] WHAT GOOD DID IT DO HIM TO COME AND DIE
[1:33:32] AND PAY THE PRICE IF HIS BLOOD AND HIS
[1:33:36] HOLY GHOST HAD NO MORE POWER TO IT THAN
[1:33:39] THAT?
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my cleansing ourselves.
[1:33:49] Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:33:55] 2 Corinthians chapter 7 verse one.
[1:34:00] Having therefore
[1:34:02] these promises,
[1:34:04] dearly beloved,
[1:34:06] let us
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; what?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Cleanse
[1:34:15] ourselves
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; ourselves
[1:34:18] from all filthiness of the flesh
[1:34:21] and spirit,
[1:34:23] perfecting holiness
[1:34:26] in the fear of God. Look at the word
[1:34:28] cleanse, purge, purify in a moral sense
[1:34:32] to free from defilement of sin, from
[1:34:34] faults. To consecrate by cleansing
[1:34:38] or purifying.
[1:34:40] Oh, you mean, brother Ni, there's some
[1:34:43] things I got to do. Yeah.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Ain't that pitiful?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; You poor little overweight lesian
[1:34:53] Christian.
[1:35:02] Now, there's no way I'll be able to
[1:35:03] finish this this morning, but I'm going
[1:35:05] to go into it and then we'll stop.
[1:35:10] Let me share something with you now
[1:35:12] historically
[1:35:14] about a Jewish wedding.
[1:35:21] In ancient Jewish tradition,
[1:35:24] marriage was considered a deeply sacred
[1:35:26] covenant
[1:35:28] and various rituals were performed to
[1:35:31] prepare the bride and groom spiritually
[1:35:33] and physically for this important step.
[1:35:37] The ritual bath or mitvah
[1:35:41] was a central part of this preparation
[1:35:44] particularly
[1:35:46] for the bride.
[1:35:48] Here's an expanded explanation of the
[1:35:51] practice and its significance.
[1:35:53] The bride immersed herself
[1:35:56] in a mikvah,
[1:35:59] a specially constructed pool
[1:36:03] of natural
[1:36:05] flowing
[1:36:07] water.
[1:36:10] And she could not
[1:36:13] be cleansed
[1:36:16] in a sistern.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Like a broken sister.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; It had to be running water,
[1:36:32] particularly constructed for this
[1:36:36] purpose.
[1:36:40] from rain, springs or rivers. This
[1:36:44] immersion was not just about physical
[1:36:47] cleanliness but ritual purity.
[1:36:50] It was seen as a spiritual cleansing
[1:36:56] symbolizing
[1:36:58] the bride's readiness
[1:37:01] for a new chapter in life
[1:37:07] free from purities.
[1:37:09] The immersion typically occurred shortly
[1:37:12] before the wedding
[1:37:15] and water symbolized life, renewal, and
[1:37:19] a connection to the divine.
[1:37:22] By immersing fully in the water, the
[1:37:25] bride experienced
[1:37:28] a symbolic
[1:37:30] rebirth.
[1:37:33] Praise be to God.
[1:37:37] So the bride experienced a symbolic
[1:37:40] rebirth preparing her to embrace the
[1:37:44] sacred bond of marriage. The immersion
[1:37:47] was accomplished by specific blessings
[1:37:51] often said silently by the bride.
[1:37:56] These blessings expressed gratitude to
[1:37:59] God and invoked his presence
[1:38:04] in the new phase of life.
[1:38:08] So the bride goes into this pool which
[1:38:12] has been designed for this particular
[1:38:14] purpose.
[1:38:16] She goes in by herself
[1:38:20] and she immerses herself
[1:38:24] in this waters of baptism as we'll say.
[1:38:29] And then she comes up
[1:38:31] and she may do it multiple times. And as
[1:38:34] she's doing it
[1:38:36] in her own heart, she's praising,
[1:38:40] giving gratitude to God and blessing his
[1:38:43] name. What's this doing? This is
[1:38:45] preparing her
[1:38:48] for a new phase of her life.
[1:38:52] Now remember, she's already betrothed to
[1:38:54] this man. By law, she is already his,
[1:38:59] but he's not yet into her yet. and the
[1:39:02] last cup of wine has not yet been drank.
[1:39:06] Now watch the parallel in Ephesians 5 as
[1:39:09] Paul
[1:39:11] uses this same type. Husbands, love your
[1:39:14] wives even as Christ loved the church
[1:39:16] and gave himself FOR IT THAT HE MIGHT
[1:39:18] sanctify
[1:39:20] and cleanse it
[1:39:23] with the washing
[1:39:26] which is present tense.
[1:39:29] the washing of the water
[1:39:33] by the word which is not logos
[1:39:37] but rama
[1:39:40] rama.
[1:39:42] So Paul picks up that the bride in the
[1:39:45] New Testament
[1:39:47] must enter into this washing.
[1:39:52] And the word Rama means that which IS OR
[1:39:55] HAS BEEN UTTERED by a living voice.
[1:40:01] A thing spoken, a declaration of one's
[1:40:05] mind
[1:40:07] made in words.
[1:40:14] Go with me to things that are to be.
[1:40:18] A pest house is where they put all the
[1:40:20] diseased people.
[1:40:23] Well, that's what sin done unto us.
[1:40:26] Put us in an earthly pest house.
[1:40:30] They wouldn't let anyone else come in
[1:40:32] the pest house because there's all kinds
[1:40:35] of germs.
[1:40:38] germs flying around in there and the
[1:40:40] people will take these germs and be sick
[1:40:44] themselves and sin brought us into the
[1:40:49] devil's past house.
[1:40:53] Oh, but the other one
[1:40:57] is called
[1:40:58] my father's house.
[1:41:01] And remember he reads this when he
[1:41:03] preaches this things that are to be is
[1:41:04] where he reads from in St. John 14. I go
[1:41:07] and prepare a place for you and take you
[1:41:10] out of this pest house and deliver you
[1:41:12] into my father's house. Amen. THERE YOU
[1:41:15] ARE. TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS OLD EARTHLY
[1:41:18] PEST HOUSE. HE'S gone to prepare A
[1:41:20] PLACE, A PERFECT place
[1:41:24] where no evil exist,
[1:41:27] no sickness exist,
[1:41:30] no old age exist,
[1:41:34] no death exist.
[1:41:37] It's a perfect place
[1:41:39] calling you to that perfection and you
[1:41:43] have to be perfect to get there.
[1:41:47] The Bible said, "So Jesus said, "Be ye
[1:41:49] therefore perfect, even as your father
[1:41:51] in heaven is perfect." IT'S A PERFECT
[1:41:53] KINGDOM.
[1:41:55] So it must be a perfect people come
[1:41:58] because you have to stand and be married
[1:42:02] to a perfect son of God. And you must be
[1:42:05] a perfect bride.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; So how can you do it through anything
[1:42:12] else
[1:42:14] but the perfect word of God?
[1:42:17] which is the waters of separation
[1:42:20] that washes US FROM OUR SINS. AMEN.
[1:42:23] That's right. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:42:26] THINK OF IT.
[1:42:30] THE DRIPPING BLOODY WORD.
[1:42:35] THE BLOOD, THE WORD OF GOD. BLEEDING
[1:42:39] blood
[1:42:42] to wash the bride in.
[1:42:48] So the word become a man
[1:42:53] and the man released three elements
[1:42:57] out of his body.
[1:42:59] Water,
[1:43:00] blood,
[1:43:02] spirit.
[1:43:06] So it was the word hanging on the tree
[1:43:12] that would release the washing of the
[1:43:14] water that be able to give the bride a
[1:43:18] rebirth.
[1:43:20] BUT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND OUR CLEANSING
[1:43:22] happens one time when it comes to the
[1:43:25] soul,
[1:43:26] but then we've got that daily cleansing
[1:43:30] of our hands and our feet.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful to God for that?
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:43:42] Oh, praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:43:45] NOTICE BLEEDING BLOOD TO WASH THE BRIDE
[1:43:47] IN. AMEN. YES, SIR. SHE STANDS PERFECT,
[1:43:50] VIRGIN, UNADULTERATED.
[1:43:52] She never sinned in the first place. SHE
[1:43:54] WAS TRAPPED INTO IT. SEE,
[1:43:57] there's the father's house
[1:44:00] that he's gone to prepare.
[1:44:04] The night before this, he preaches the
[1:44:06] rapture.
[1:44:08] One day, there will come a blast from
[1:44:10] heaven, and the dead in Christ shall
[1:44:13] rise first.
[1:44:15] them Old Testament saints back yonder
[1:44:19] who are waiting will blast forth and
[1:44:21] come out first and go into the
[1:44:23] resurrection
[1:44:25] and we'll drop right in line going into
[1:44:27] the sky. These old mortal bodies changed
[1:44:30] and made like unto his own glorious
[1:44:33] body. What a parade that'll be when it
[1:44:36] starts heavenward some of these days and
[1:44:39] that rapturing time that LAYS AHEAD.
[1:44:43] ALL PROUDLY
[1:44:45] DISPLAYING THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:44:49] UPON THEIR CHEST,
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; the message of God
[1:44:55] in the hour that they lived in.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; That's the hour we're looking forward
[1:45:04] to.
[1:45:05] Brother,
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; can't you see, children? As we come
[1:45:11] closer and closer,
[1:45:14] he wants us just to keep washing.
[1:45:19] I remember when I was a little boy, I
[1:45:21] was an odd little old boy. Always was.
[1:45:23] You say, "You're still odd. I know
[1:45:24] that."
[1:45:26] But I remember when I was a little boy,
[1:45:28] I couldn't stand to have my hands dirty.
[1:45:32] And that's crazy. We was a bunch of
[1:45:33] hillbillies, man. Harry was rednecks
[1:45:35] from top of our head down to the bottom
[1:45:37] of our feet. We'd get out and swing on
[1:45:38] grape vines and just, you know, do all
[1:45:40] kinds of crazy stuff. I was constantly
[1:45:43] washing my hands. I couldn't stand I'm
[1:45:46] still that way. I hate to say it, but
[1:45:48] I'm still that way.
[1:45:51] But oh, how much MORE
[1:45:53] DO I WANT MY MY WALK WITH GOD?
[1:45:58] HOW MUCH MORE I WANT MY MOTIVES, MY
[1:46:00] OBJECTIVES, MY ATTITUDES
[1:46:04] TO BE WASHED IN HIS PRESENCE.
[1:46:08] OH, brother D. I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT SAVED.
[1:46:10] NO, I'VE ALREADY HAD THAT INITIAL
[1:46:13] MIKVAH.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; I'VE ALREADY BEEN I'VE ACCEPT THE
[1:46:17] BETROAL. HALLELUJAH. I HAVE RECEIVED THE
[1:46:20] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, BUT I KNOW IT
[1:46:23] AIN'T GOING TO BE LONG. I'M GOING TO SEE
[1:46:26] HIM. AND I DON'T WANT NO SPOTS ON MY
[1:46:29] GARMENTS. I DON'T WANT NO BLEMISHES. I
[1:46:32] DON'T WANT NO WRINKLES.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; AND HOW AM I GOING TO STAY CLEAN?
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Washing of the water
[1:46:41] by the word.
[1:46:44] Let me read this and I'll close.
[1:46:48] Paul goes on in verse 27 that he might
[1:46:50] present it to himself a glorious church
[1:46:54] not having spot
[1:46:58] or wrinkle.
[1:47:00] Where does wrinkles come from?
[1:47:04] Setting
[1:47:06] or laying.
[1:47:12] The bride ain't got no spiritual
[1:47:13] recliners.
[1:47:15] I ain't talking about in your house and
[1:47:16] I'm talking about in your walk with God.
[1:47:18] You ain't got time to sit down. You
[1:47:21] ain't got no time to to just relax. This
[1:47:23] is not the time to relax. It's a time of
[1:47:25] war.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; No spot, no wrinkle or any such thing.
[1:47:35] Verse 28. So ought men to love their own
[1:47:37] bodies,
[1:47:39] the wives as their own bodies. Let me
[1:47:42] read just another part of this and then
[1:47:44] we'll pick it up real money next time.
[1:47:46] The pre-marriage mikvah
[1:47:49] is a spiritual and uplifting preparation
[1:47:54] for the sanctity of the wedding day
[1:47:58] likened to the bride's own personal yam
[1:48:02] kapor
[1:48:05] the day
[1:48:07] she is reborn
[1:48:11] as a unit together with her husband
[1:48:15] approaching ing life
[1:48:18] a fresh slate.
[1:48:21] You imagine one day you'll hear the last
[1:48:23] sermon that you'll ever need
[1:48:28] and your hands and your feet will be
[1:48:31] washed
[1:48:33] for the last time.
[1:48:37] And either you leave the earth in your
[1:48:39] own personal embark
[1:48:41] or we will go together as bride
[1:48:46] and the great resurrection
[1:48:49] will set in.
[1:48:52] And those
[1:48:55] who have gone on before us will be
[1:48:57] released from the sixth dimension
[1:49:00] who've walked in the light of their day.
[1:49:04] And what have we done? We've had our own
[1:49:07] personal yam kapour,
[1:49:10] our day of full redemption.
[1:49:13] And that last cleansing
[1:49:16] will be consummated with a surge of the
[1:49:19] spirit of God that will come over our
[1:49:21] bodies and we will take our last dip.
[1:49:24] You go to your church service the last
[1:49:25] time you'll raise your hands and praise
[1:49:28] God as a mortal. for the last time.
[1:49:31] You'll sing for the last time as a
[1:49:34] mortal. Praise be to God. And then all
[1:49:37] of a sudden, you'll come up out of those
[1:49:39] cleansing waters. It oh my, who knows,
[1:49:42] the last service we have before the
[1:49:44] rapture might be a hide skin and type of
[1:49:47] service. And we all just be have to have
[1:49:49] help being packed out of the back door.
[1:49:51] And the Lord says they're ready to come
[1:49:53] home. They're ready to come home. I
[1:49:56] don't know what it'll be, but I know one
[1:49:58] thing. Shouting ain't what gets us ready
[1:49:59] a lot of the times. Preacher pat us on
[1:50:02] her head ain't what gets us ready. It's
[1:50:04] that hide skin and type of stuff that
[1:50:06] says you got to do this and you got to
[1:50:08] do that. Come on, somebody. Why? Because
[1:50:10] the real bride of JESUS CHRIST WANTS TO
[1:50:13] BE A PERFECT MATCH
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; FOR HER HUSBAND.
[1:50:20] STAND.
[1:50:25] Praise be to God.
[1:50:33] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:41] Hallelujah.
[1:50:45] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:48] We worship you today, Father.
[1:50:54] Lord God,
[1:50:56] I want to give you praise
[1:50:59] and honor.
[1:51:02] Thank you for giving me strength today,
[1:51:04] Lord, to help me.
[1:51:07] I'm grateful, my father.
[1:51:10] I pray for what I'll lack, dear God,
[1:51:12] that you'd make up for it.
[1:51:16] Lord Jesus, may each of us realize
[1:51:20] what the rest of Christendom laughs at
[1:51:22] and makes fun of and oh, they preach
[1:51:24] this and they preach that. I can never
[1:51:26] go there. Don't do this. Don't do that.
[1:51:29] What they think is unnecessary is what
[1:51:31] we realize is the final building blocks
[1:51:34] for our walk with you.
[1:51:37] Oh Jesus.
[1:51:40] Even though that little lady has been
[1:51:42] betrothed to that young man,
[1:51:45] she's lived faithful. Most of the
[1:51:48] engagement was at least for a year to
[1:51:50] make sure she was not with seed of
[1:51:52] another man.
[1:51:54] Then everything starts going to the day
[1:51:56] of preparation.
[1:51:59] She doesn't even know when it will be,
[1:52:02] but he'll send the friend of the
[1:52:03] bridegroom
[1:52:05] with her wedding dress.
[1:52:08] Even then, she doesn't know exactly the
[1:52:10] day to put it on.
[1:52:12] But then that messenger will come with a
[1:52:14] message on a certain day and say, "Today
[1:52:18] is the day. Get ready. Get dressed."
[1:52:23] She may get dressed at 8:00 in the
[1:52:25] morning cuz she's under such
[1:52:27] anticipation.
[1:52:29] Noon passes, still not there. 1:00,
[1:52:32] she's getting more anxious. two, three,
[1:52:34] four. She's still more anxious.
[1:52:38] All he told her was get dressed and be
[1:52:41] ready.
[1:52:43] Praise God.
[1:52:45] And we know it was night time actually
[1:52:47] when he come because that's a parable
[1:52:48] you gave us in Matthew 25.
[1:52:52] Oh Lord Jesus, we know how it is. We're
[1:52:56] living in this dark, filthy, cruel,
[1:52:59] ungodly world.
[1:53:02] Everywhere we look around us is black
[1:53:04] and smut,
[1:53:06] nasty, filthy,
[1:53:08] ungodly things around us.
[1:53:11] We just brush up next to it, Lord. And
[1:53:13] it gets all over our white wedding
[1:53:16] garments.
[1:53:18] We have to go to church and hear the
[1:53:21] preaching of the word. And every God
[1:53:23] called man's got spot remover. Every God
[1:53:27] called man has got these blemish
[1:53:29] remover. And he's got his iron in there
[1:53:31] to iron out them wrinkles. Sometimes he
[1:53:33] uses it on her head and here and there,
[1:53:35] too, cuz we need it. But it's to have us
[1:53:38] ready. We want to be pressed spotless.
[1:53:43] We want to be ready, Jesus.
[1:53:46] Help us, Father.
[1:53:49] Thank you for being patient with us,
[1:53:50] Lord.
[1:53:52] Thank you for being longsuffering and
[1:53:54] enduring and waiting for the harvest of
[1:53:57] the earth.
[1:53:59] We're sorry that it's took us so long to
[1:54:02] come up to where we are. We ask for your
[1:54:05] forgiveness
[1:54:07] for our longevity, Lord, of how we've
[1:54:10] delayed it.
[1:54:12] Oh God, may you help us, Lord, that
[1:54:15] we'll have a desire greater than ever
[1:54:16] before.
[1:54:18] May we be like that little lady whenever
[1:54:21] she steps down into that mikvah.
[1:54:25] She may go up and down several times,
[1:54:27] who knows? Rehearsing the promises of
[1:54:29] God, remembering who she was before he
[1:54:32] met her, remembering what life she had
[1:54:35] and what new life she's fixing to do.
[1:54:38] May we look at it that way when we come
[1:54:40] to church. Say, "Well, praise God.
[1:54:42] Wonder what I'm going to hear today.
[1:54:44] Wonder what I'm going to hear Wednesday
[1:54:45] night that's going to help cleanse me
[1:54:46] and get me one service closer to being
[1:54:48] ready to meet the Lord Jesus."
[1:54:51] Lord, that's the way we want to look at
[1:54:53] it. The prophet said, 'We come to church
[1:54:55] to find out our faults and our
[1:54:57] shortcomings.
[1:54:59] One day, Lord, I'll dip for my last
[1:55:02] time. I'll be cleansed of whatever it is
[1:55:06] that hinders me. And when that last dip
[1:55:09] removes it and whether I go by the way
[1:55:11] of the grave or whether I I'm privileged
[1:55:14] to be able to live and be caught up with
[1:55:16] the rest of the living saints, I don't
[1:55:19] really care, Lord. just at your
[1:55:21] timeline. Whatever you want for me is
[1:55:23] what I want. What a day that will be.
[1:55:26] Jesus.
[1:55:29] Hallelujah.
[1:55:32] As our brother Dave sang it earlier,
[1:55:34] Lord, we're longing for that place.
[1:55:38] No more night.
[1:55:40] No more pain.
[1:55:42] No more suffering. No
[1:55:45] more babies born blind.
[1:55:48] No more cancer,
[1:55:51] no more disease, Jesus.
[1:55:54] Oh, Father, help us.
[1:55:57] We love you today, Lord God. We worship
[1:55:59] you with all of our hearts.
[1:56:02] We magnify your name, Lord.
[1:56:06] How many wants to be ready with all your
[1:56:08] heart?
[1:56:10] You just want him to take your life and
[1:56:13] mold you and shape you. You want to have
[1:56:16] an open heart to him today, friends,
[1:56:17] where he can always speak to you and you
[1:56:20] won't resent him. You won't resent his
[1:56:21] word. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:56:26] Praise the Lord, Jesus.
[1:56:29] I'm going to ask you, would you just
[1:56:30] take and lay your hand over
[1:56:32] on the brother, sister that's standing
[1:56:34] by you. Brother Joe, would you come and
[1:56:38] pray over the people?
[1:56:41] Hallelujah.
[1:56:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:58] Pray for Abby. She is sick. And
[1:57:02] also Leah and Shawn traveling to Alabama
[1:57:05] as orientation for a new job. So, Sister
[1:57:08] Bonnie, let's remember that.
[1:57:11] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so grateful
[1:57:13] for your word this morning, Lord.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I pray, Father, that you would
[1:57:18] let it embed itself in our hearts, and
[1:57:20] our souls, Lord Jesus.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, we take granted so many times,
[1:57:24] Father, that Lord, that we're a
[1:57:27] Christian, we're Christlike, Father,
[1:57:28] when we look at the definition of what
[1:57:30] it's like, Father.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, we seem to feel so short.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; But Lord, we want to give you praise and
[1:57:35] glory this morning, Father, for what
[1:57:37] you've made us, Lord. We thank you for
[1:57:39] for touching brother Donnie this morning
[1:57:41] for giving him Lord strength Lord Jesus
[1:57:43] to to bring forth the word Lord. Lord we
[1:57:46] want to worship you. We want to praise
[1:57:48] you Lord for what you've given us Lord.
[1:57:50] Lord as I was reading last night Father
[1:57:53] when when when John turned and looked
[1:57:55] and Father the the lamb had opened the
[1:57:57] book Lord that contained the seals and
[1:57:59] brother Benham said that was rapturing
[1:58:01] faith in those seals. The redemption
[1:58:03] plan Father was was brought out Lord.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And the Bible says I pray
[1:58:08] father
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; that the elders hearts our lives help us
[1:58:11] beast ourselves from anything
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Lord the angels that was around the
