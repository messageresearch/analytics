[37:38] I was born to live for him born to
[37:41] worship him is that what you feel like
[37:42] you're here for
[37:44] I didn't just happen upon this you
[37:46] didn't just happen upon this God thought
[37:49] of you before the world began
[37:51] there aren't enough devils and all of
[37:54] hell
[37:55] and Johnson City and there's a bunch in
[37:57] Johnson City to keep us out of the
[38:00] program of God
[38:02] and somebody said
[38:05] God bless you let's turn together
[38:07] tonight
[38:08] the book of First Corinthians chapter 12
[38:10] if you would
[38:12] the Gucci tonight in the name of the
[38:13] Lord Jesus
[38:16] thank God for all that he means to us
[38:18] all of his blessings and all the things
[38:20] that he's done for all of us
[38:24] imagine whenever the Jewish Christians
[38:28] begin to read what we are fixing to read
[38:31] together
[38:33] it must have just been
[38:36] a struggle for many of them
[38:40] to try to comprehend what Paul was
[38:43] conveying
[38:45] listen carefully
[38:47] for the body is not one member but many
[38:50] if the foot shall say because I am not
[38:52] the hand I am not of the body is it
[38:55] therefore not of the body
[38:57] if the ear shall say because I am not
[39:00] the odd
[39:01] I am not of the body is it therefore not
[39:05] of the body
[39:06] if the whole body were an eye where were
[39:10] the hearing
[39:11] if the whole we're hearing where were
[39:14] the smelling
[39:18] but now God hath set the members every
[39:23] one of them in the body
[39:27] as it has
[39:28] pleased him
[39:31] now you imagine you've been raised a Jew
[39:33] all your life
[39:35] so you've known sacrifice levitical law
[39:39] leverage law law law
[39:42] then you get saved
[39:44] and you hear this for your first time
[39:47] and this preacher
[39:49] is putting these new testament converts
[39:54] as the body
[39:55] of God
[39:59] and saying that they were the body
[40:03] of Christ
[40:04] and that they were like members you
[40:06] imagine them looking think you mean I'm
[40:09] like a finger or I'm like an ear or a
[40:12] nose on God
[40:16] you see the Old Testament could never
[40:18] produce such a relationship or such an
[40:22] understanding now you think you have a
[40:24] hard time and understanding this and
[40:26] that and the other you imagine coming
[40:28] out of Judaism wherever bit of it was
[40:30] Thou shalt Thou shalt not Thou shalt
[40:33] Thou shalt not you shall not mix linen
[40:36] and Woodland on your garments don't sow
[40:38] two different kinds of seed in the same
[40:41] Row in your garden don't do this don't
[40:44] do that and then this man turns around
[40:46] and tell you you are baptized into the
[40:49] body of Jesus himself
[40:51] no matter what age you live in it still
[40:55] takes one access to God divine
[40:58] revelation amen
[41:00] Amy's glad for it tonight
[41:03] you'd like to be remembered as we go to
[41:05] the Lord in prayer him and he has a need
[41:07] a request
[41:08] brother Pete Lawson texted me before I
[41:10] came out a little bit ago I wanted us to
[41:12] pray for him tonight he's not been
[41:13] feeling very well developed a fever
[41:16] later in the day also I talked to
[41:18] brother Jerry Phillips today he
[41:20] certainly needs prayer in his body and
[41:22] also Brother Sam Clark uh brother Bobby
[41:25] Hayden had texts me about Brother Sam
[41:27] today and also brother Jerry so we
[41:29] certainly want to remember these these
[41:32] requests
[41:33] Heavenly Father we counted
[41:35] a great honor
[41:37] that we are part of the body of Christ
[41:41] we read it we've heard about it
[41:44] but I wonder sometimes it's the fullness
[41:47] of it really struck home to us what that
[41:51] means
[41:52] to be a part of your body
[41:55] I pray Lord that you would make it real
[41:57] to us tonight
[41:59] we know there's one way that we access
[42:02] into the very heart and mind of God
[42:05] and that is by you pulling us to
[42:09] yourself and revealing yourself to us
[42:13] as your Prophet is so well explained it
[42:16] to us and said
[42:18] Christ's way of making himself known to
[42:21] his church
[42:23] is by revelation
[42:25] so we could memorize the word we could
[42:27] even memorize the message
[42:29] we can listen to tapes so well that we
[42:33] can tell you what brother Branham is
[42:35] fixing to say
[42:36] and be as lost as we could be
[42:39] unless what we're hearing
[42:41] is divine revelation to us
[42:44] so I pray father that you would help us
[42:46] tonight once again we've gathered here
[42:48] they've put forth the effort many of
[42:51] them have worked today no doubt they're
[42:52] tired they had was pressed for time some
[42:56] of them had to cut short or suffer and
[42:58] this and that to be able to be here
[42:59] tonight so we've not just come to see
[43:02] one another we've not come for a
[43:04] protractive meeting but we've come to
[43:07] hear from heaven
[43:08] Lord God we're asking you that you would
[43:11] take the service and anoint us with your
[43:13] presence help me to move away out of us
[43:16] out of the side of the people even Lord
[43:19] God out of my own reasoning on my own
[43:22] thinking Lord God help me to be able to
[43:25] speak the words of God
[43:27] speak to us in our father be mindful of
[43:30] these sick ones that we've requested
[43:32] their names Lord and the hands that were
[43:34] uplifted signifying a need would you
[43:36] move form father we ask in the name of
[43:39] the Lord Jesus amen God bless you you
[43:42] may be seated
[43:47] heard some really good reports of the
[43:49] camp up in Ohio
[43:51] certainly appreciate what the Lord did
[43:52] up there
[43:54] amen certainly glad to be identified
[43:57] with a group of people around the world
[43:59] not just in America but around the world
[44:02] that have a living God that is among
[44:06] them read with me if you would in the
[44:08] Book of Romans chapter 12 verse 5.
[44:10] notice again now of of all the New
[44:13] Testament writers Paul was given by God
[44:17] a great understanding a greater
[44:20] understanding than any of the rest of
[44:23] the Apostles
[44:24] as far as the new births the blood the
[44:28] mystery of worship even of being
[44:32] baptized into the mystical body Peter
[44:35] wraps good things about it James writes
[44:38] good things Matthew Mark Luke and John
[44:40] not so much because it was not given to
[44:44] them but God endowed Paul with an
[44:48] understanding like none of the rest of
[44:50] the men in the apostolic age had and we
[44:52] thank God for that do we not because God
[44:55] wanted to give to him an understanding
[44:58] that would not just be beneficial for
[45:00] that age but it would be beneficial for
[45:02] many many hundreds of years and here we
[45:05] are two thousand years later still
[45:07] feasting on what gay God gave to our
[45:11] brother now listen to how he deals with
[45:13] this in Romans 12. so we being many are
[45:16] one body in Christ one body in Christ
[45:21] and every one members
[45:24] one of another
[45:27] so what Paul does is places us
[45:30] individually we're baptized by the Holy
[45:33] Ghost but we are baptized collectively
[45:37] now this is what the prophet says in our
[45:40] day that we are baptized individually
[45:43] but yet we are collectively the body of
[45:47] Christ so each one has their own
[45:49] experience each one has their own walk
[45:52] with God but yet we are not an island in
[45:56] that we don't need one another so Paul
[45:59] says it this way in the first century
[46:01] writing so we being many are one body in
[46:05] Christ and every one members of one
[46:09] another I think if that ever really
[46:11] struck our hearts right that we would
[46:13] treat one another different than what we
[46:16] do and I think it would make us to where
[46:19] we would want to be around one another
[46:22] more you know brother random talks about
[46:24] his church Arthur Branham Tabernacle
[46:26] whenever he was there there more and he
[46:28] said that preachers would come to him
[46:30] and ask him Billy how do you do that
[46:33] because then people would just love one
[46:36] another so much and whenever they would
[46:38] part like on Sunday night they had
[46:40] church on Sunday morning and Sunday
[46:42] night and Wednesday night and whenever
[46:44] they would leave church on Sunday night
[46:47] they would stand out front and stand
[46:49] around the back door and they would cry
[46:52] they would cry because they was going to
[46:56] be apart from one another from Sunday
[46:59] night to Wednesday night they couldn't
[47:01] hardly stand the thoughts of being away
[47:04] from one another just on Monday and
[47:07] Tuesday and they was going to be back
[47:09] together again on Wednesday night and
[47:12] perchers would ask him Billy how do you
[47:14] do that how do you get that love among
[47:17] them and there was so something about
[47:19] them and they was not just Longing To Be
[47:21] In God's Presence but they were longing
[47:24] to be in one another's presence well
[47:27] brother Ram tells us of course that it
[47:29] was the true gospel that he preached
[47:30] well I find it amazing that no doubt
[47:33] most of our message churches feel like
[47:35] that we're much deeper in the message
[47:38] than what that church was in those days
[47:40] but I wonder how many of our churches
[47:43] feel the same way about one another that
[47:45] they did then makes you wonder are we
[47:48] deeper or are we just deeper in our
[47:51] minds or are we really deeper in our
[47:53] experience and deeper in our soul but
[47:56] now remember Paul one of the early
[47:58] church to be able to understand that
[48:01] they were many and they were as diverse
[48:03] as we are today but yet one body in
[48:07] Christ and every one members one of
[48:10] another not just one was Christ but
[48:13] members one of another First Corinthians
[48:15] chapter 12 verse 12 for as the body is
[48:19] one and has many members and all the
[48:22] members of that one body being many are
[48:26] one body me so also is Christ Now watch
[48:31] how he is identifying Christ with the
[48:35] human Visage
[48:36] identifying Christ with a human image
[48:41] identifying Christ notice he does not
[48:44] say Jesus because Jesus is of course on
[48:49] the throne of God Jesus is the
[48:52] personification of deity that sets on
[48:56] the throne of God God never had a
[48:58] permanent flesh body until Jesus come on
[49:01] the Earth but notice what what term Paul
[49:04] uses he does not say that we are members
[49:08] of Jesus but we are members of Christ
[49:12] what is Christ it is the anointed one
[49:16] Messiahs the anointed one so you and I
[49:20] are not baptized into the material flesh
[49:24] body of Jesus you understand that but we
[49:27] are baptized into the mystical body
[49:31] which is called Christ so that is the
[49:35] anointed one it was not it was not
[49:39] listen carefully Christos Christ that
[49:42] died for you the anointing cannot die it
[49:46] was the human Visage or human image of
[49:50] God which was Jesus now Jesus was of
[49:55] course given the titles of Lord and
[49:58] Christ this same Jesus hath God made
[50:02] both Lord and Christ but read your Bible
[50:05] real close and you'll notice he was not
[50:08] called that until after he rose from the
[50:12] dead now Jesus you never find him before
[50:15] his resurrection from the dead saying
[50:20] all power is given to me in heaven a
[50:23] nurse show it to me in your Bible he
[50:25] never said that I'm until after he
[50:28] raised from the dead he could not say it
[50:31] well Hallelujah he could not say all
[50:36] power is given unto me he could not say
[50:39] that until after he had raised from the
[50:43] dead well somebody say Amen then once he
[50:47] raised from the dead then he could stand
[50:50] and say all power is given unto me in
[50:55] heaven and in earth that could not be
[50:58] said in the Jesus form but it could be
[51:02] said in the Christos form it cannot be
[51:05] said of you even though you may be a
[51:09] seed before your new birth it cannot be
[51:12] said of you in reality I and my father
[51:17] are one until after you become the
[51:21] anointed one in this day do you
[51:24] understand the bride is the messiah of
[51:27] the hour
[51:29] I said I don't know what can you say
[51:31] that because she is the anointed one we
[51:35] are here in his stand the prophet of God
[51:38] said every God called preacher is called
[51:42] to stand in the very stead and the place
[51:45] of Jesus Christ
[51:48] is that quite a challenge or not
[51:51] but let me not limit it to a preacher
[51:54] because the preachers are not the only
[51:56] ones that are anointed by the Holy Ghost
[51:59] but every person you're denied men women
[52:02] boys girls whatever you are if you have
[52:05] the Holy Ghost in your soul you are
[52:08] called as as an anointed one to
[52:12] represent the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[52:15] and the church said
[52:18] notice Paul says for us the body is one
[52:20] and as many members and all the members
[52:23] of that one body being many are one body
[52:27] so also is not Jesus but so also is
[52:32] Christians now you understand it's
[52:34] totally impossible for us to be baptized
[52:38] into the flesh body of Jesus it's
[52:42] impossible always I was washed in the
[52:45] blood and he dripped one drop of blood
[52:47] from me no that's symbolism there was
[52:50] only so much blood in the body of the
[52:53] Lord Jesus there was not enough blood in
[52:56] the chemistry of his body to have one
[52:59] drop for every human being that would
[53:02] ever be saved but the blood was taken as
[53:05] a symbol the token oh I know even some
[53:08] message people don't believe this but it
[53:10] don't matter to me what message people
[53:12] believe or don't believe the prophet of
[53:14] God taught us the token in this hour is
[53:18] is not the blood the token is the Holy
[53:22] Ghost because the token is the life now
[53:26] this is why many people think they're
[53:28] under the blood but they're not because
[53:31] they deny the very life that came out of
[53:34] the blood I know there's message
[53:36] preachers that preach that the blood is
[53:38] token there to Heaven went deep enough
[53:40] themselves but the spirit of God is the
[53:44] token and when I see that I will pass
[53:47] over you so it is the spirit of God that
[53:50] baptizes us into the mystical Body of
[53:54] Christ and that's why when you're in
[53:56] Christ Jesus and you pray and you may
[53:59] think well I'm nothing I'm nobody ever
[54:01] devil in hell is scared to death of you
[54:03] because what the devil sees and what the
[54:06] devil hears it's not your voice it's not
[54:09] your Humanity it's not your weakness
[54:12] it's not my weakness it's the mystical
[54:14] Body of Christ that's standing there
[54:18] oh Hallelujah
[54:21] notice in verse 27 now Paul said now ye
[54:24] are
[54:25] listen to this church
[54:27] now ye are
[54:30] the body
[54:32] of Christ
[54:33] now again not Jesus
[54:36] ye are the body of Christ
[54:40] and members in particular
[54:43] but notice in verse 28 it is God that
[54:48] sets us in our position in Christ and in
[54:52] the local assembly but now God hath set
[54:56] the members every one of them in the
[54:59] body as it has pleased him so he doesn't
[55:03] even ask you what do you want to be
[55:05] here's a multiple choice just pick out
[55:08] check to box whichever one you want to
[55:10] be you want to be a singer you want to
[55:12] be an organ player you want to be a
[55:13] deacon you want to be a trustee God is
[55:16] the one who sets that in the body so the
[55:19] mystery of our life really is us getting
[55:22] out of our self and thinking well I want
[55:25] to be this in the church and I want to
[55:27] do that and I want to do something else
[55:28] that that's really as no relevance to
[55:31] God but God wants us to go to him who
[55:34] brought us on the earth and say why did
[55:36] you bring me here what do you want me
[55:38] here for Lord I do believe it was you
[55:40] that sent me here to the Word of Life
[55:42] Church then what am I therefore am I
[55:45] there to be a preacher am I there to be
[55:46] a deacon and I know to be a special
[55:48] singer maybe my voice is not a special
[55:50] singing voice but I'll be a good back of
[55:53] voice in the choir maybe I'll write the
[55:55] songs that the choir sing I don't know
[55:57] what I'm supposed to do Lord but would
[55:59] you please let me know and it would say
[56:02] me and you a whole lot of trouble and
[56:04] brother Donnie too
[56:07] and everybody else I'm going to church
[56:08] with
[56:09] now won't you notice the word here that
[56:12] Paul used when he said but now God hath
[56:15] set it's the exact same word that Jesus
[56:19] used in Saint John 15 16. notice this
[56:23] now you have not chosen me but I have
[56:27] chosen you and ordained you now the word
[56:31] ordained in the Greek is the exact same
[56:34] word that Paul used for set so set and
[56:38] ordain are the exact same words so you
[56:41] have not chosen me but I have chosen you
[56:44] and ordained you that you should go and
[56:48] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[56:50] should remain that whatsoever ye shall
[56:53] ask of the father in my name he may give
[56:56] it to you so then it is God that sets us
[57:00] in the body it is God that places us
[57:03] positionally just as God put our fingers
[57:06] where they belong as God put our toes so
[57:09] they belong on our ears or they belong
[57:11] and so on and so on and they are so
[57:13] designed by the Creator himself that
[57:16] they fit exactly so is it in the
[57:19] spiritual body notice in First
[57:21] Corinthians chapter 12 verse 11 but all
[57:24] these worketh that one and self-same
[57:27] spirit
[57:28] dividing to every man severally as he
[57:32] will now notice this is not as you and I
[57:35] will so according to whose will the
[57:38] father again so the father May pick one
[57:41] man and he may give him this gift and
[57:43] that gift and another and the Lord may
[57:45] give one man my goodness a half a dozen
[57:47] gifts and him then come to his brother
[57:50] say natural Brethren the Flesh and he
[57:53] may come to him and he may give him one
[57:55] and it may be two out of a big old
[57:58] family and two of them be called to
[58:00] really serve God and then God may go to
[58:02] another family and give one man one gift
[58:04] and he may skip everybody else in that
[58:07] family and give somebody else another
[58:09] one so God is the one who places the
[58:12] gifts you believe that now whether it's
[58:15] a gift to sing whether it's a musical
[58:17] ability or whether it's a gift to preach
[58:19] or whatever it is God is the only one
[58:22] that can do it now can people within
[58:25] themselves desire to do something that
[58:28] they're not called to do absolutely now
[58:31] when you get into that it's where you
[58:33] move into great deception watch this in
[58:36] verse 28 and God has sat in the church
[58:40] first apostles secondarily prophets
[58:43] thirdly teachers after that Miracles
[58:46] then gifts plural of healings helps
[58:50] governments diversities of tongues which
[58:53] means different kinds of tongues and
[58:56] every one of them is going to be placed
[58:58] in the body as God Wills now of course
[59:01] this is where Pentecost whenever they
[59:03] begin to cabbage down was the word that
[59:06] brother Brandon used whenever they begin
[59:08] to cabbage down that tongues was the
[59:11] evidence so then everybody according to
[59:14] them that got the Holy Ghost got tongues
[59:16] we're believing I was in Pentecost for
[59:18] several years and I prayed through many
[59:20] many people that got tongues but it
[59:23] didn't take me long to realize they
[59:25] didn't have the Holy Ghost but yet when
[59:27] they made that the initial evidence then
[59:30] Satan could impersonate I've seen it
[59:32] around the altarus many times and them
[59:35] all mamas and daddies some of you come
[59:36] from a Pentecostal background and that
[59:38] come up and pray for them and beat him
[59:40] on the back and shake them and say Jesus
[59:44] you got it brother you got it you got it
[59:47] and what did they get and then they got
[59:49] not a power to help them to overcome not
[59:52] a power that would help them overcome
[59:54] drinking and smoking and lying and so on
[59:56] and many of them turned away from God
[1:00:00] never to come back because of the ill
[1:00:03] teaching that they were taught well you
[1:00:05] got it and they said well I suppose they
[1:00:07] got the holy ghost at least they told me
[1:00:09] I did and I went right back out into the
[1:00:11] world again that's what Satan wants to
[1:00:13] do
[1:00:14] and if we're not careful then we will
[1:00:17] come and we made a new evidence now our
[1:00:19] new evidence and the message is well we
[1:00:22] believe God sent a prophet well if
[1:00:23] that's the evidence every devil in hell
[1:00:25] is saved because they met with him one
[1:00:27] on one many of them and you I guarantee
[1:00:30] you one thing you'll never find any of
[1:00:32] them Devils been on believe the sign the
[1:00:34] website you'll never find any of them
[1:00:36] Devil's been on YouTube You'll Never
[1:00:38] Find Them writing any books god Set Me
[1:00:40] Free from the message Hallelujah glory
[1:00:43] to God I'm so free them Devils met this
[1:00:45] prophet of God they were scared tea
[1:00:48] totally out of their minds
[1:00:50] well somebody's saying that so they
[1:00:53] wouldn't do such a thing is that the
[1:00:55] truth yet they believed that he was
[1:00:58] truly a servant of God just like they
[1:01:00] did the Lord Jesus We Know Thee thou
[1:01:02] Jesus our son of God and he commanded
[1:01:05] them that they should not make known who
[1:01:07] he was isn't it amazing that demons can
[1:01:10] identify righteous men when church
[1:01:12] people will sit there and call them
[1:01:14] false
[1:01:15] wow so God does this in his own
[1:01:19] sovereignty and he places them according
[1:01:21] to the Divine abilities given to them by
[1:01:24] God so as God placed it in the natural
[1:01:27] body so God places it in the mystical
[1:01:30] body and each person really ought to be
[1:01:33] content was what God gave them now we
[1:01:36] face the facts some will never be what
[1:01:38] others are some will never be the great
[1:01:41] singers that others are yet they sing
[1:01:43] and they're a blessing and others will
[1:01:45] never be as talented on the piano or the
[1:01:48] organ and yet they should not even
[1:01:49] compare themselves well I wish everybody
[1:01:52] would clap as loud for me as they do for
[1:01:54] brother so and so but they just kind of
[1:01:56] do this when I sing well at least you're
[1:01:59] getting that much out of them are you
[1:02:01] doing it for them are you doing it for
[1:02:02] the Lord who are you doing it for well
[1:02:04] come on I I believe that some folks are
[1:02:07] doing it for people we don't want to do
[1:02:09] it for one another we want to do it for
[1:02:11] God
[1:02:12] now what you notice in question answers
[1:02:14] 1961. someone said to me not long ago
[1:02:17] the Lord called me to preach I said well
[1:02:20] then preach and so I really think it's
[1:02:23] so Satan if he can just get somebody to
[1:02:26] act like that and I want you to listen
[1:02:27] what the devil will try to do the devil
[1:02:30] will try to deceive a man well women too
[1:02:33] of course if you believe in women
[1:02:34] preachers but he will try to deceive a
[1:02:37] man to make him think he's called to
[1:02:40] preach when in reality he ain't called
[1:02:43] at all
[1:02:44] now you're talking about a tricky thing
[1:02:47] notice if you can get somebody to act
[1:02:49] like that and then deceive them so can
[1:02:53] you imagine then a person can actually
[1:02:56] be deceived a man a man just so deceived
[1:03:00] and he feels like he's called to preach
[1:03:02] and then he will go preach and he will
[1:03:04] study and he gets under this burden and
[1:03:07] he will his wife will get under this
[1:03:09] family will get under the church that he
[1:03:11] attends will get under it the pastor
[1:03:13] that he sets under will get under it
[1:03:15] because the pastor will have to make
[1:03:17] room for him to see if he's really
[1:03:19] called a preach or not God don't tell me
[1:03:21] I don't know I don't know the young men
[1:03:23] come to me but only I think I'm called
[1:03:25] to preach the only thing I don't do is
[1:03:27] just try to make her inform and see if
[1:03:28] they are if he ain't so if you're
[1:03:30] dealing with them for six months nine
[1:03:32] months a year a year and a half two
[1:03:35] years and you give up and forfeit this
[1:03:37] service and that service and that
[1:03:39] service and once you wind up looking at
[1:03:42] and realizing with some of them they
[1:03:44] were not even called in the first place
[1:03:45] they were deceived not were they trying
[1:03:49] to deceive anybody else no they were not
[1:03:51] trying to be Wicked they were not trying
[1:03:54] to be condemning or nothing like that
[1:03:56] they actually thought those young men
[1:03:58] sitting right here that I've talked to
[1:04:01] in our church and they come to me many
[1:04:03] of them years ago and felt like they
[1:04:05] were called to preach and I would just
[1:04:06] go through the best that I knew look
[1:04:08] brother God's called you it'll be this
[1:04:10] and this and explain it if I was you I'd
[1:04:12] blate and I'd pray and they'd come back
[1:04:14] to me a month later six weeks later
[1:04:16] brother Donny you know what I did
[1:04:17] exactly what you told me to do I don't
[1:04:19] believe it's the Lord I don't believe it
[1:04:21] is I tell them look if it's God calling
[1:04:23] you you ain't going to get away from it
[1:04:24] he'll haunt you he'll torment you you
[1:04:28] won't get away from it so if you can get
[1:04:30] away from it leave it alone because you
[1:04:33] wasn't called in the first place well
[1:04:35] come on somebody say Amen if it's a real
[1:04:37] Call of God God ain't going to tell me
[1:04:40] to tell your mama to tell your daddy to
[1:04:43] tell your third cousin and then he'll
[1:04:44] tell your wife and then they'll tell you
[1:04:47] if God's calls you God will call you
[1:04:52] come on somebody God's gonna call you
[1:04:55] look God verified by others yes he will
[1:04:57] and God will let on other people's
[1:05:00] hearts absolutely and God can tell them
[1:05:02] look brother you've got a gift sir but
[1:05:03] if God's calling you God's going to deal
[1:05:06] with you first
[1:05:09] thank you Jesus now notice the prophet
[1:05:12] said see Satan can do somebody act like
[1:05:13] that that deceives them that's what he
[1:05:16] wants to do then the whole world points
[1:05:18] their finger right there somebody thinks
[1:05:20] they have the gift of speaking in
[1:05:22] tongues and interpretation some has the
[1:05:24] gift of Divine Healing somebody else
[1:05:26] thinks look at him sometimes they're
[1:05:28] mistaken mistaken in those things and
[1:05:32] sometimes they think they haven't got it
[1:05:35] when they have
[1:05:37] so it's very tricky
[1:05:41] so a person could be called to preach
[1:05:43] and the devil tell them that
[1:05:46] and a person not called to preach and
[1:05:49] the devil telling them there is
[1:05:54] Lord have mercy by the done how in the
[1:05:56] world does a person judge it
[1:06:00] paragraph 52.
[1:06:02] so always do this Brethren when you feel
[1:06:05] that you're supposed to do a thing first
[1:06:08] find out if it's scripture for you to do
[1:06:11] it
[1:06:12] well the Lord called me to do this and
[1:06:14] other well is there scripture for what
[1:06:17] you say God calls you to do
[1:06:19] now not just in one place
[1:06:22] but also the Bible
[1:06:24] well don't sit there and look at me
[1:06:25] about God I'm fixing to read it to you
[1:06:26] if it's in the scriptures not just wrote
[1:06:29] in one place but I mean completely
[1:06:32] scriptural Through the Bible for you to
[1:06:36] do it oh my goodness you mean a person
[1:06:39] then that's really called of God they
[1:06:42] will see themself and Jeremiah's call
[1:06:45] they will see themselves when they read
[1:06:48] about Peter being called you see they
[1:06:51] will so identify with themselves you
[1:06:53] know but I've had young men to come and
[1:06:55] talk to me before and their brother
[1:06:57] Donnie I'm thinking maybe I might be
[1:06:58] called to preach well brother tell me
[1:07:00] how it happened well I'll tell you what
[1:07:01] brother Donnie I I was sitting there
[1:07:03] reading my Bible before church and you
[1:07:06] wouldn't you know it you got up there
[1:07:08] and you read that from the same text and
[1:07:11] you started preaching from that same
[1:07:12] text and I say brother that happens to
[1:07:15] my wife
[1:07:18] so does that mean she's called to
[1:07:22] how many does that happen to you
[1:07:24] oh dear lord some of our women are
[1:07:26] raising their hands oh no Jesus
[1:07:30] well that don't mean you're called to
[1:07:32] preach that means we're in the same same
[1:07:34] unction of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:36] don't that mean something special to you
[1:07:38] when that happens to you of course it
[1:07:40] does it blesses your heart that's not a
[1:07:43] call of God I bet young men and come and
[1:07:45] talk to me I'm not sure why I'm going
[1:07:46] this way now but I'm gonna do it uh
[1:07:48] young men and come to my brother Donnie
[1:07:50] I'm just saying the Lord's call me well
[1:07:51] brother you know what have you been
[1:07:52] doing I've done got 37 sermons prepared
[1:07:54] brother Donnie
[1:07:57] that is not an individual seeking the
[1:08:00] mind of God
[1:08:01] that is an individual that is convinced
[1:08:04] before they ever even come and talk to
[1:08:06] their pastor
[1:08:08] which according to the message is
[1:08:10] contrary to what you're taught to do if
[1:08:12] you ever feel led to do something then
[1:08:15] he said put it with a word and consult
[1:08:18] your pastor amen
[1:08:19] amen not after you've made up your mind
[1:08:21] well I know folks don't believe that
[1:08:23] quote but what if it's right
[1:08:27] and you don't follow it
[1:08:30] Mama now watch I love the way brother
[1:08:33] Remnant explains it says that then
[1:08:35] usually he said yourself an evangelist
[1:08:37] or a pastor a teacher Prophet whatever
[1:08:39] God might have called you to DC but if
[1:08:41] you have the gift of Tom's
[1:08:42] interpretation of tongues any of the
[1:08:44] non-spiritual gifts in the church four
[1:08:46] spiritual offices any position saying
[1:08:48] then usually the way I watch it for
[1:08:51] myself now watch how he looked at it
[1:08:52] this is me I watch the nature of the
[1:08:56] person
[1:08:57] and see what kind of a gift that they're
[1:09:00] professing
[1:09:02] see God will work with his creature the
[1:09:06] way he's made him now if you see a man
[1:09:09] real flighty going on and he said the
[1:09:11] Lord call me for such and such to be a
[1:09:13] pastor now a pastor can't be a flighty
[1:09:16] person
[1:09:18] and the church said
[1:09:20] the pastor can't be a flighty person a
[1:09:23] pastor's solid sound
[1:09:27] but I find it so amazing some of the men
[1:09:30] that I know in the message that have
[1:09:32] become pastors and their Pastor has to
[1:09:35] encourage them to even attend church
[1:09:37] Faithfully
[1:09:39] because they get discouraged and get
[1:09:40] down and and get so all worn out
[1:09:43] and then that's that kind of man becomes
[1:09:45] a pastor wow
[1:09:47] I find that very strange myself
[1:09:50] if you're down just being an evangelist
[1:09:52] I hate to think what you're going to be
[1:09:54] when you become a pastor
[1:09:56] God called me to be a teacher
[1:09:59] now watch this is so simple God called
[1:10:01] me to be a teacher watch him how he
[1:10:05] interprets the word he gets it all mixed
[1:10:09] up and everything then you can tell
[1:10:12] sometimes I wonder friends how many
[1:10:14] preachers in this message are even God
[1:10:17] called
[1:10:18] you know what I judge it by these quotes
[1:10:22] how many of them have made the office
[1:10:24] messes that ever was come on somebody
[1:10:27] say amen and they interpret the word
[1:10:30] this way and they cause a big big split
[1:10:32] and the message and you know part of
[1:10:34] them go this way and part of them go
[1:10:36] that way a god-called teacher ain't
[1:10:38] going to do no such nonsense
[1:10:43] um
[1:10:44] but then the thing to do your position
[1:10:46] is usually known whether you can do it
[1:10:50] or not wow that is good good
[1:10:53] understanding it
[1:10:55] now when God called me to be an
[1:10:57] evangelist I wanted to be a pastor wow
[1:11:02] you mean God called brother render to be
[1:11:03] one's hand brother brown one to be
[1:11:05] something else
[1:11:07] I'm guilty too
[1:11:08] God called me the very preacher I said
[1:11:10] no I don't want be no preacher
[1:11:12] did he did him listen to me
[1:11:14] and then whenever he called me to preach
[1:11:16] he didn't even say now look I've got
[1:11:17] five foes here which one you want
[1:11:20] and everyone left his shoes off I said
[1:11:22] God this ain't even fair I mean you
[1:11:24] don't even give me a choice and then
[1:11:25] you've got all these different aspects
[1:11:27] of the ministry I could entertain you
[1:11:28] don't even write me choose that the
[1:11:30] order this ain't even fair at all
[1:11:31] you see when you're really called of God
[1:11:33] it's not something that you yourself
[1:11:35] want to do a man who wants to do it nine
[1:11:38] times out of ten ain't called in the
[1:11:40] first place a real servant of God runs
[1:11:44] from the call
[1:11:46] well praise the Lord
[1:11:49] when God called me to be an evangelist I
[1:11:52] wanted to be a pastor and I thought
[1:11:54] staying at home here would be just five
[1:11:59] wow now let me skip a little bit and go
[1:12:02] down a little further on the quote here
[1:12:03] my calling was an evangelist now this
[1:12:05] morning Lane right here on the
[1:12:06] cornerstone if we could burst in there
[1:12:08] tonight you'll see a fly leaf off of my
[1:12:10] Bible where he told me to be an
[1:12:12] evangelist and I wasn't a successful
[1:12:15] pastor
[1:12:17] now you won't hear this quote quoted I
[1:12:19] realize but when God called me to preach
[1:12:21] the message
[1:12:22] I can preach the whole thing
[1:12:25] you see headquarters never call me no
[1:12:28] group of message people never call me
[1:12:30] God call me
[1:12:33] so I'm gonna read quotes like this
[1:12:37] I wasn't a successful pastor
[1:12:42] anybody in here brave enough to read it
[1:12:44] with me
[1:12:45] never
[1:12:48] ah
[1:12:50] and yet some of the folks in the message
[1:12:53] now say brother Brandon was their pastor
[1:12:56] so how in the world can a man from the
[1:12:58] sixth Dimension Pastor those of us who
[1:13:02] are still in these dimensions
[1:13:04] so how long has it been since you've
[1:13:06] seen your pastor anyway
[1:13:08] how long has it been since you consulted
[1:13:11] with your pastor how long has it been
[1:13:13] now the prophet tells you according to
[1:13:15] the message whenever you feel led to do
[1:13:17] something put it with the word of God
[1:13:18] and consult your pastor so that puts you
[1:13:22] in a real bind does it not then whenever
[1:13:24] you get ready to make a decision a
[1:13:26] business decision family decision
[1:13:28] whatever
[1:13:29] tell me how that works that you're able
[1:13:31] to be transported into the sixth
[1:13:34] Dimension to consult with your pastor
[1:13:36] and then come back down to the Earth and
[1:13:38] get the answer
[1:13:40] now you see where that come from men
[1:13:43] that are interpreting God's word and
[1:13:46] making lies out of the truth
[1:13:49] well amen
[1:13:52] now notice he said never would be
[1:13:54] because I haven't got the
[1:13:57] patience oh so it takes patience to be a
[1:14:03] pastor
[1:14:06] takes patience notice he don't say
[1:14:09] tongues healing Miracles patience
[1:14:14] now is healing important yes it's
[1:14:16] Miracle is important yes but I want you
[1:14:18] to notice the main thing that he focuses
[1:14:21] on that a pastor must have patience
[1:14:25] and God not only calls him but he calls
[1:14:28] his wife right along with it
[1:14:30] you all know that already by being here
[1:14:32] part of this ministry right because I
[1:14:35] haven't got the patience and what it
[1:14:38] takes
[1:14:39] to be a pastor so those who believe that
[1:14:42] brother Branham fulfilled all five and
[1:14:45] all the rest of us preachers ought to
[1:14:47] set down you are a liar
[1:14:50] and if you don't get that evil devil off
[1:14:53] of you you're going to be lost
[1:14:56] because that devil anointing you is
[1:14:59] speaking contrary to the scripture and
[1:15:03] contrary to the message
[1:15:04] [Applause]
[1:15:05] now push play in obey
[1:15:10] I don't know why it is but when I push
[1:15:12] play I come up with quotes like this
[1:15:15] well Hallelujah
[1:15:17] now he said so therefore if I tried to
[1:15:19] be a pastor I'd be just as far out as a
[1:15:21] pastor trying to be an evangelist you
[1:15:23] see what I mean you can see the way the
[1:15:26] Lord calls you what your position is in
[1:15:30] the body and the church said now let us
[1:15:34] run a parallel tonight by the help of
[1:15:35] the Lord we'll jump back into the book
[1:15:38] of Exodus if you'd like to turn up with
[1:15:40] me we can read it up on the screen in
[1:15:42] the book of Exodus chapter 31 and I like
[1:15:45] to run a parallel if the Lord will help
[1:15:47] me on god-giving just instructions and
[1:15:50] design an architectural ability to
[1:15:54] certain men to be able to build the
[1:15:56] Tabernacle of God now let me say this
[1:15:59] right up front for those who are here
[1:16:01] tonight and those that will stream this
[1:16:03] service and those that may archive it
[1:16:04] later for those of you who have this
[1:16:07] narrow narrow view that the Tabernacle
[1:16:11] in the wilderness was just this
[1:16:13] makeshift something that was maybe a 40
[1:16:16] by 60 tenth and a had a few tent poles
[1:16:18] on the side and it was just thrown up on
[1:16:21] the side I hate to tell you but I think
[1:16:23] I'll go ahead and tell you right up
[1:16:24] front you are sadly mistaken you see
[1:16:27] many people feel like that in order for
[1:16:30] God to move in a church you've got to be
[1:16:33] in a storefront and your windows have
[1:16:35] got to be busted out and you can throw a
[1:16:37] tomcat through the door you know and
[1:16:39] there's 40 blowing there in the
[1:16:40] wintertime and we're all sitting there
[1:16:42] freezing to death and they identify that
[1:16:44] as humility you need to read your Bible
[1:16:49] come on somebody
[1:16:51] Now watch how that God is has told Moses
[1:16:55] and he's given the revelation of what
[1:16:58] kind of place God wants and God told him
[1:17:00] prior to this let them make me a
[1:17:02] sanctuary that I can come down and be
[1:17:05] among them now remember these were
[1:17:07] slaves so they had had some ability no
[1:17:10] doubt back in the land of Egypt but
[1:17:12] watch what God is fixing to do and the
[1:17:14] Lord spake unto Moses saying Exodus 31
[1:17:17] 1. see I have called by name
[1:17:24] I can't watch God this is God's first
[1:17:28] Tabernacle on the earth and it's going
[1:17:31] to foreshadow Solomon's simple it's
[1:17:34] going to foreshadow also the mystical
[1:17:36] body which we are part of tonight
[1:17:39] so God is going to build have them to
[1:17:42] build for him a tabernacle and God's
[1:17:46] going to use human beings to do it
[1:17:49] but he don't want them to stand in line
[1:17:51] for volunteers who wants to be the
[1:17:53] engraver who wants to be the Weaver who
[1:17:56] wants to be this but I want you to
[1:17:58] notice what God does
[1:18:00] God starts this whole thing out
[1:18:03] by calling men
[1:18:07] and he calls them by name
[1:18:11] you so I'm talking about a genuine call
[1:18:13] now you see that it would not be no
[1:18:15] strange thing when the Lord Jesus comes
[1:18:17] on the earth and whenever he's going to
[1:18:20] establish his mystical body that he
[1:18:24] would get on the earth and he would call
[1:18:26] men Peter Andrew James John Bartholomew
[1:18:31] sadius Judas right what'd he do call
[1:18:34] them by name don't you understand it's a
[1:18:38] new building program
[1:18:42] God so watch what God did God spoke this
[1:18:46] man's name
[1:18:48] so this man was called by God
[1:18:52] amen
[1:18:53] I have called by name
[1:18:58] the son of your eye the son of her of
[1:19:02] the tribe of Judah so what is this man
[1:19:04] getting a Divine call so this man is not
[1:19:07] seeking after it this man did not
[1:19:09] necessarily want it but God calls him
[1:19:12] now we don't know much about this man
[1:19:14] whether he even had a whole lot of
[1:19:16] abilities or not but a Divine gift
[1:19:18] always have attributes of the Divine
[1:19:21] call so what does this man give he gets
[1:19:24] a Divine call every God call man has a
[1:19:28] Divine call some were sent and some just
[1:19:31] went
[1:19:32] well some of mama called them some of
[1:19:35] them Daddy call them and some of them
[1:19:37] the wife called them
[1:19:38] well
[1:19:40] so the Lord called him also according to
[1:19:43] Exodus chapter 35 verse 30 the Lord
[1:19:46] called him so the Lord does the deciding
[1:19:49] and the Lord does the calling now men
[1:19:51] might try to presume upon that and think
[1:19:54] well that's what I'd like to be I'd like
[1:19:56] to be a preacher oh my goodness I'd like
[1:19:59] to be an evangelist I'd like to be this
[1:20:01] or that the other but that's not the way
[1:20:02] that it works and it was not only a
[1:20:05] Divine call but a distinct call it was
[1:20:09] not something that the man would ever be
[1:20:11] able to get away from this man would
[1:20:13] never be the same again God is going to
[1:20:15] impart to this man he's going to be able
[1:20:19] to devise curious things now watch this
[1:20:23] God call man he's going to be given
[1:20:25] Enlightenment on metallurgical abilities
[1:20:29] now apparently the man didn't have it
[1:20:31] before God is going to give this man and
[1:20:34] what the Hebrew words are that is used
[1:20:35] is the mind of a genius God is going to
[1:20:39] give this man the ability to be able to
[1:20:43] carve and work on metal and do this and
[1:20:46] that and the other now as I said the
[1:20:48] Bible doesn't say that the man who had
[1:20:49] to do it before so we're told then who
[1:20:53] was called and now we're being shown
[1:20:55] what he's called to do Amen to devise
[1:21:00] curious works so it sums up all the work
[1:21:04] that's going to be involved in the
[1:21:07] Tabernacle so God not only decides who's
[1:21:10] going to do it but what they're going to
[1:21:12] do
[1:21:13] and then you've got the capability of
[1:21:16] the call so God calls this man now it's
[1:21:19] up to God to give the man the ability of
[1:21:22] what he needs to carry it out
[1:21:24] no doubt these people had done some of
[1:21:26] these things in the land of Egypt but
[1:21:28] told my thought there and I'll read it
[1:21:30] to you in a moment when God calls God
[1:21:32] enables when God sins God anoints when
[1:21:37] God gives you something God will give
[1:21:39] you the backbone of a ramrod that's what
[1:21:41] you need you'll stand there if you've
[1:21:43] got to stand by yourself and people will
[1:21:45] look at you and think how in the world
[1:21:47] can you do it and you'll even ask
[1:21:49] yourself the same question but when God
[1:21:51] calls God gives ability when God calls
[1:21:54] God enables when God sends you he goes
[1:21:57] with you
[1:21:59] amen and if you like capability in the
[1:22:04] area that you're professing that you're
[1:22:05] called to do it's either one of two
[1:22:07] things either you're not called to do it
[1:22:10] or you've been delinquent delinquent and
[1:22:14] being able to hook up with the right
[1:22:16] channel of God or maybe refusing
[1:22:18] guidance from some Elders that's been
[1:22:20] around for a long time
[1:22:22] I know we despise all that we hate all
[1:22:25] that we're so much against organization
[1:22:27] we're against organism I said it to you
[1:22:29] several months ago but I'll say it again
[1:22:31] you look in the Bible and you show me
[1:22:33] where preachers went out from the
[1:22:35] original Church in Jerusalem on their
[1:22:37] own
[1:22:39] I challenged anybody preacher Deacon
[1:22:42] trustee anybody show me where any
[1:22:45] preacher lit out on his own show me
[1:22:49] but they sent them Force they sent them
[1:22:52] forth they never went out on their own
[1:22:54] well I feel they had to go over here and
[1:22:56] I feel led to go over there they were
[1:22:58] sick from the church well come on
[1:23:01] children read your Bible into the book
[1:23:02] of Acts they didn't do it on their own
[1:23:04] and rebel if the church didn't send you
[1:23:07] forward you were not recognized they
[1:23:11] never read your Bible they were not
[1:23:14] recognized as being said of God do you
[1:23:17] understand even Paul the prophet
[1:23:19] whenever he went out he went up to
[1:23:22] Jerusalem and they sent him out a
[1:23:25] prophet that's your new testament
[1:23:28] oh my goodness now you see when God then
[1:23:31] calls this individual God will give them
[1:23:33] adequate capability the ability to be
[1:23:37] able to do it notice this Exodus chapter
[1:23:39] 35 verse 31 whenever it quoted this
[1:23:42] about this man it says he hath filled
[1:23:44] him with the spirit of God in wisdom so
[1:23:47] being filled means the capability of
[1:23:50] doing whatever it is he faces God's
[1:23:52] calling to do that and it's up to God to
[1:23:55] give the man the ability now there
[1:23:57] they're not making a mystical body but
[1:24:00] they're going to build a tent or a
[1:24:01] tabernacle let's read again Exodus 31 3.
[1:24:05] now God said I have filled him with the
[1:24:08] spirit of God in wisdom and in
[1:24:12] understanding and in knowledge and in
[1:24:15] all manner of workmanship so now this
[1:24:19] guy was not called to handle the word
[1:24:21] he's not a levite he's not a coincide
[1:24:23] he's not nothing that can be the
[1:24:25] Priestly order but this man is called in
[1:24:28] the ability of being able to take wood
[1:24:31] and shape it and take Stone and shape it
[1:24:34] now remember they're going to have an
[1:24:35] ephod and they're going to have all
[1:24:37] these precious stones the birthstone and
[1:24:39] this man's got to know how he has to
[1:24:41] understand metallurgical Tempo
[1:24:43] temperatures to where gold can come up
[1:24:46] to a certain spot silver come up to a
[1:24:48] certain spot brass come up to a certain
[1:24:50] spot this man's got to understand all
[1:24:52] that where'd he get it out from God
[1:24:55] so God filled this man now keeping your
[1:24:58] mind the parallel of the New Testament
[1:25:00] Church God knew the New Testament Church
[1:25:02] needed a Peter God knew they needed an
[1:25:05] Andrew but God also knew they needed a
[1:25:07] Paul so God did not confuse the gifts
[1:25:10] but God gave to Paul exactly what Paul
[1:25:13] needed he gave to Peter exactly what
[1:25:16] Peter needed and as long as they stayed
[1:25:18] in their field designed by God there was
[1:25:20] never an issue come on somebody if we
[1:25:23] can find our place in the body of Christ
[1:25:25] and work together as the people of God
[1:25:28] for one common goal I'll tell you one
[1:25:31] thing the devil would become powerless
[1:25:33] before us that's why he wants to divide
[1:25:36] us that's why he wants to separate us
[1:25:38] he's done it in every move that's ever
[1:25:41] been on the earth and you'd have to be
[1:25:43] blind if you think he hasn't done it in
[1:25:45] our message but as much as he's tried to
[1:25:47] do it he will never divide the bride
[1:25:49] from the word and the prophet said it'll
[1:25:52] be a paradox if he ever runs her
[1:25:55] together if he ever gets it together but
[1:25:57] he promised it and he will he knows how
[1:26:00] to send the little trouble our way he
[1:26:02] knows how to send a little persecution
[1:26:04] not the persecution of the tribulation
[1:26:06] period but just enough trouble to get us
[1:26:09] all together
[1:26:11] oh my now notice what this man is
[1:26:14] Anointed he's going to be anointed to do
[1:26:15] to devise
[1:26:18] to devise cunning works
[1:26:23] to work and goals and silver and embrace
[1:26:27] now wait a minute
[1:26:29] you mean to tell me
[1:26:31] God
[1:26:32] wants gold
[1:26:34] and silver and brass and blue and purple
[1:26:39] and ivory all these high dollar items
[1:26:43] God wants them in his house
[1:26:52] do you understand that Tabernacle and
[1:26:54] the value today
[1:26:57] was over 30 million
[1:27:00] dollars
[1:27:06] and God was the one that gave them the
[1:27:08] pattern we got a nice place here but
[1:27:10] it's about like a Shack on the side of
[1:27:12] the road compared to what that place was
[1:27:14] worth
[1:27:16] but yeah people get it in their mind
[1:27:18] humility humility humility don't
[1:27:20] understand the first letter of it
[1:27:23] God himself anointed this man well why
[1:27:26] didn't God just say take
[1:27:30] to another
[1:27:32] crook just make up I don't care I don't
[1:27:34] care just throw up whatever you want no
[1:27:37] doubt there's some of them people that
[1:27:38] would done it and the reason I say that
[1:27:40] because there's some today that do God
[1:27:42] the same way you go to Lowe's and buy
[1:27:44] you the very best faucet you can find
[1:27:46] and you go online and fight if ain't
[1:27:49] nothing good enough you'll go to New
[1:27:50] York get it if you've got to do it
[1:27:51] you'll put you in the franchise bathtub
[1:27:53] and you'll put you in the best this and
[1:27:55] that and other and when it comes to the
[1:27:57] house of God you want to throw God a
[1:27:58] shady up on the side of the road and say
[1:28:01] we want to be humble you no doubt
[1:28:03] hypocrite
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:06] you mean you think more of yourself than
[1:28:08] you would of God I figured God deserves
[1:28:10] a whole lot better than I deserve and
[1:28:13] I'm going to go ahead and say that God
[1:28:14] deserves a whole lot better than you
[1:28:16] deserve
[1:28:24] wow
[1:28:25] to devise devise so this guy this is
[1:28:30] where part of the genius part comes from
[1:28:31] and the spirit of God anointed this man
[1:28:34] so he would look and say a piece of
[1:28:37] Walnut say
[1:28:39] oh my goodness
[1:28:41] wow
[1:28:44] I can see it now can't you
[1:28:49] wow
[1:28:50] other people and I said shame on you
[1:28:53] humble yourself
[1:28:55] that's too shiny
[1:28:58] well you need to Fancy altafire
[1:29:01] Imperial
[1:29:03] it's done been a bunch of Tears shed on
[1:29:05] this altar I'm hoping there's a bunch
[1:29:07] more
[1:29:09] well Hallelujah
[1:29:11] well glory to God we shouldn't have
[1:29:13] these fine padded chairs in here you
[1:29:15] always should my brother Tim comes we
[1:29:17] need them
[1:29:20] you'll pay better attention if you don't
[1:29:22] go to sleep that is oh we now want you
[1:29:24] to have a comfortable place but it ain't
[1:29:26] just for your comfort
[1:29:29] that's a representation of what I think
[1:29:32] about my God
[1:29:34] oh I could have built him a little Shack
[1:29:36] on the side of the road and took the
[1:29:38] money that I spent for this place and
[1:29:40] put it in my bank account and why would
[1:29:42] I want to do such a foolish thing
[1:29:49] have done it'll be surprised of the
[1:29:51] millionaire message preachers that they
[1:29:53] are
[1:29:54] and I say it's a crying shame oh but I
[1:29:58] say we ought to give to God not only a
[1:30:01] nice place but everything we are our
[1:30:05] hearts our souls our minds our strength
[1:30:09] [Applause]
[1:30:16] I'm being this brother right here I
[1:30:19] can't wait to meet this guy
[1:30:21] this man Harry was so gifted
[1:30:24] to devise cunning works that never been
[1:30:28] anything like it
[1:30:30] so God just anointed him
[1:30:33] and he just get these thoughts
[1:30:35] Moses Ascend Thou shalt not do this thou
[1:30:38] shall not do that that old brother sin
[1:30:41] oh God
[1:30:43] that diamond would look awesome
[1:30:46] and that goal coming up around it and
[1:30:49] them chapters
[1:30:51] not chapter but chapter them chapters on
[1:30:55] the tops of them columns I'm going to
[1:30:58] put a lily on one side and a pomegranate
[1:31:01] on the other side and I want to name one
[1:31:03] of them Jason and I'm going to name the
[1:31:06] other one bohas and I'm gonna then that

[1:31:18] painting on your mind whatever your
[1:31:20] vocation is where are you you imagine
[1:31:22] that old boy he slept about it he
[1:31:24] dreamed about it why he was anointed
[1:31:28] Lord God children if God could anoint a
[1:31:30] man to be able to do that for the house
[1:31:32] of God don't you think you and I can get
[1:31:34] so in love with the Lord Jesus that
[1:31:36] whatever we're called to do maybe you're
[1:31:38] called to visit the self oh I'm so proud
[1:31:41] to hear some of our young folks have
[1:31:43] been visited those that shut-ins and
[1:31:45] can't go I hope some of you get under
[1:31:47] such an anointing and get so burdened
[1:31:49] that you want to go back again and again
[1:31:51] and again and bring them a smile let
[1:31:54] them know they love them let them know
[1:31:56] that we care for them brother Jonathan
[1:31:57] play your guitar and sing and say
[1:31:59] something that's encourage you or if we
[1:32:02] can get so a part of the family of God
[1:32:04] and one in the house of God this is your
[1:32:07] time
[1:32:12] notice this
[1:32:14] to devise cunning Works to work in gold
[1:32:18] and silver and brass and cutting of
[1:32:21] stones
[1:32:22] they didn't do no good to cut them if
[1:32:25] you didn't know how to settle
[1:32:27] but he just sat around
[1:32:30] just looking at you know whatever it was
[1:32:34] glory to God
[1:32:37] is why I said what is it now
[1:32:40] I know it's something to do about church
[1:32:41] that seemed like to me that's all you
[1:32:43] think about
[1:32:46] sound like a good man to me
[1:32:49] and in Cotton Stones I understand and
[1:32:52] then carving
[1:32:54] Timber
[1:32:56] to work in
[1:32:58] working of workmanship
[1:33:01] and our behold I have given was him a
[1:33:04] whole of that
[1:33:06] the son of aishmach
[1:33:08] of the tribe of Dan isn't this and in
[1:33:11] the hearts of all that are wise-hearted
[1:33:16] but I that they may make all
[1:33:20] that I have commanded thee
[1:33:30] so God had appeared God had appalled God
[1:33:32] had a James God had a Bartholomew look
[1:33:34] at our message in this day look at all
[1:33:36] the different preachers that's god's got
[1:33:37] and look at some of them
[1:33:39] they defy such curious works we call
[1:33:43] them sermons
[1:33:47] you know what I'm saying they then they
[1:33:49] think wow where did they get that at and
[1:33:52] either even other preachers will say wow
[1:33:54] I wish I'd have thought of that
[1:33:56] it's not a thought of it
[1:33:59] event sermon whatever my goodness
[1:34:00] where'd God get it cause
[1:34:02] gives every everyone the way he wants to
[1:34:05] and then this man preaches on this and
[1:34:07] this man preaches on that and they'll
[1:34:09] say all glory to God what a great
[1:34:11] understanding oh my thank you Lord why
[1:34:14] because God is the one who gives him but
[1:34:16] watch it all for you
[1:34:19] do you think it's so this preacher
[1:34:21] cannot preach that one and this one
[1:34:22] cannot do that one no if the real
[1:34:25] surrendered men of God is all for you
[1:34:28] every sermon coming from God is for you
[1:34:31] it's a love gift
[1:34:35] oh my
[1:34:38] God so from the nature
[1:34:40] of what we see of the offerings
[1:34:46] I put this down so you'll be able to
[1:34:48] read it with me
[1:34:49] this is what they brought out of the
[1:34:51] land of Egypt gold silver brass blue
[1:34:55] purple Scarlet fine linen ramskins dyed
[1:35:00] red what we call Badger scans oil spices
[1:35:05] incense Onyx stones
[1:35:08] and other stones
[1:35:12] remember they spoil the Egyptians
[1:35:15] let's say it this way it was back paid
[1:35:18] with interest
[1:35:20] [Applause]
[1:35:24] so what did they do they gave to God
[1:35:27] their wages
[1:35:30] oh wow
[1:35:32] so Moses lifts an offer and I said all
[1:35:35] right I want everybody everybody that's
[1:35:37] got gold everybody's going to see where
[1:35:39] we're going to meet all this for the
[1:35:40] house of God they started bringing some
[1:35:42] much stuff in that Moses had to get up
[1:35:45] and make an announcement and said no
[1:35:46] more offerings we've got way more than
[1:35:48] what we need wow you talking about a
[1:35:52] giving people that wanted to take of
[1:35:54] theirselves and never remember they were
[1:35:56] Paupers
[1:35:57] they were proper State this was the
[1:35:59] richest they had ever been in their
[1:36:02] lives and yet what does God do God says
[1:36:05] I want it
[1:36:06] and what did they do so if God wants it
[1:36:08] we'll give it to him
[1:36:10] so here they bring all these offers now
[1:36:12] this is only than that aspect of it but
[1:36:14] think of it from this side too they must
[1:36:16] have also brought Looms spinning wheels
[1:36:20] instruments for cutting precious stones
[1:36:23] anvils hammers furnaces melting pots
[1:36:27] with a vast variety of tools for the
[1:36:30] different artists employed in the work
[1:36:32] of the Tabernacle Smith's joiners
[1:36:36] Carvers and gilders
[1:36:40] wow
[1:36:42] God wanted them to be a part of what he
[1:36:45] was doing
[1:36:47] amen
[1:36:48] God know what it's just about the Don he
[1:36:51] does this and brother Donnie does that
[1:36:52] and brother Daryl and these ministers
[1:36:54] they do on the deacons God don't want it
[1:36:56] to be just that way God wants this to be
[1:36:58] your church God wants this to be your
[1:37:01] work as well as mine and we work
[1:37:03] together for one thing look friend it's
[1:37:06] not us trying to divide this group in
[1:37:08] that group and say well who's got the
[1:37:09] biggest following in the message my
[1:37:11] goodness we should be well beyond that
[1:37:13] but it's not our move no way this ain't
[1:37:16] my message so to speak oh y'all know you
[1:37:18] call it brother Donny's church I'm only
[1:37:20] here as a Shepherd I believe this church
[1:37:22] Belongs to the Lord Jesus
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:27] yeah
[1:37:28] let me read through this and they'll
[1:37:30] close you momentarily Exodus 35 30 and
[1:37:33] Moses said unto the children of Israel
[1:37:34] now what she's going to repeat what God
[1:37:36] told him see the Lord has called the
[1:37:39] name basilio the son of your eye the son
[1:37:41] of her of the tribe of Dan and has
[1:37:43] filled him with the spirit of God and
[1:37:45] wisdom and understanding and in
[1:37:46] knowledge and in all manner of
[1:37:48] workmanship and to devise curious Works
[1:37:51] in gold and in silver and in brass
[1:37:53] cutting of stones to set them carving of
[1:37:56] wood make any manner of cunning work you
[1:37:59] see Divine abilities are given to men to
[1:38:03] accomplish a Divine Purpose
[1:38:06] our abilities are not given to us for
[1:38:09] our own use
[1:38:10] this is why such a danger for preachers
[1:38:12] to get into business
[1:38:15] because if they're not careful they'll
[1:38:17] tap into that gift and they'll get into
[1:38:20] making money with that gift
[1:38:23] come on now
[1:38:25] they'll use that god-given gift you've
[1:38:28] seen it as well as I am and sometimes
[1:38:29] preachers get on the top of the biggest
[1:38:31] pyramids in the message except banana
[1:38:33] real pyramid of love and charity and
[1:38:35] faith and all of that it's a pyramid of
[1:38:38] money come on brother Donnie
[1:38:42] now once you notice what else that God
[1:38:45] is going to give to this man
[1:38:47] the ability
[1:38:50] to teach
[1:38:53] you see every gifted individual
[1:38:56] is not a teacher you ever get around
[1:38:58] people before and they could do this and
[1:39:01] this and this and this and you say show
[1:39:02] me how you do that
[1:39:04] and when they get down and explaining it
[1:39:05] to you you are more confused than you
[1:39:07] was before they started
[1:39:09] now they're very good at what they do
[1:39:11] but they don't have the ability to teach
[1:39:14] others how to do it because they stand
[1:39:16] there from where they're at and they're
[1:39:18] doing what's automatic in their brain
[1:39:20] been there for 15 to 20 years and you're
[1:39:22] standing there's you know illiterate as
[1:39:24] you can be concerning the subject but
[1:39:26] this man not only him but the other
[1:39:28] brother they were not only given these
[1:39:30] great ability to devise all these
[1:39:32] beautiful cunning works that God said
[1:39:34] I'm going to make you Brothers teachers
[1:39:37] you're going to teach others
[1:39:43] watch in verse 34. he has put in his
[1:39:46] heart
[1:39:48] that he may
[1:39:50] teach
[1:39:54] both he
[1:39:56] and a holy ebb
[1:39:58] so what are these brothers going to do
[1:40:01] they're going to be over the entire work
[1:40:05] say like
[1:40:07] a messenger to an age
[1:40:11] and then there'll be others that'll go
[1:40:13] out from under them
[1:40:15] and if they are Faithfully taught and
[1:40:18] will stay with what the teachers taught
[1:40:21] them
[1:40:22] then they'll be able to build the house
[1:40:23] of God
[1:40:25] now you see they're giving all this
[1:40:27] wisdom of No Doubt there were some
[1:40:28] younger guys you think I'm going to
[1:40:30] follow him I don't bless God I feel led
[1:40:33] to do this and that and the other I
[1:40:34] ain't no man going to tell me what to do
[1:40:36] well you broke God's program right there
[1:40:39] I no doubt they had it same as we do in
[1:40:42] every age that yet that these men were
[1:40:45] not only great Artisans and great
[1:40:47] Craftsmen but they're going to teach by
[1:40:50] divine inspiration they don't want to
[1:40:53] keep this to themselves now now I'm the
[1:40:55] only one that can do this don't don't
[1:40:56] look but
[1:40:59] you look this way brother I I'm the only
[1:41:01] one who can do this God ain't giving
[1:41:03] this to nobody but me don't you look
[1:41:04] over here now
[1:41:06] but God enlightened them with this great
[1:41:09] ability and I said take and show this
[1:41:11] with those others that are called to do
[1:41:14] so then it will be the body building the
[1:41:17] house of God
[1:41:21] he has put in his heart that he may
[1:41:24] teach mostly and a holyhead the son of
[1:41:26] eshimach of the tribe of death you see
[1:41:29] it was essential that these two Master
[1:41:32] Craftsmen should also be able to teach
[1:41:36] their subordinates
[1:41:39] oh wow but the teaching is only as good
[1:41:42] as the subordinate will listen
[1:41:45] I'll tell friend you'd be surprised if
[1:41:47] you knew how hard that it really is for
[1:41:50] a yacht of young preachers in this
[1:41:51] message
[1:41:53] to take any advice from an older
[1:41:55] minister
[1:41:56] I I never ceased to Marvel me myself
[1:41:59] coming out of Pentecost never having a
[1:42:01] mentor in Pentecost never haven't really
[1:42:03] anybody you could go talk to coming to
[1:42:05] the message you know kind of being the
[1:42:06] same way and I look back and I say oh
[1:42:08] Lord how much these have been on me how
[1:42:11] much easier been on you all if I'd have
[1:42:13] been able to talk to some men and been
[1:42:15] able to have the right type of influence
[1:42:16] I'm talking about denomination I'm
[1:42:18] talking about God call me in God is
[1:42:20] setting up no organization God never
[1:42:22] called them Apostles a set of no
[1:42:24] organization but it was the apostolic
[1:42:26] way and what did they do those God
[1:42:29] called men had to teach water baptism
[1:42:31] they had to teach the godhead they
[1:42:34] taught the truth is that right and
[1:42:36] that's the way it's supposed to be this
[1:42:38] is the way the house of God is built God
[1:42:40] called these two men as Master Builders
[1:42:43] remember Paul used the word and Paul was
[1:42:45] a master builder well come on Saints God
[1:42:48] had another master builder in this day
[1:42:50] and it ain't me and it ain't no other
[1:42:52] preacher and we ain't promised another
[1:42:54] master builder neither we've stop the
[1:42:56] master builder that we need in this age
[1:42:58] it was a prophet of Malachi for come on
[1:43:01] somebody I know some of the folks in the
[1:43:03] message ain't going to preach the
[1:43:04] message no more they're getting tired of
[1:43:06] quote no problem well that's fine if
[1:43:08] they want to do that that's up to them
[1:43:10] I'm going to keep on quoting I'm going
[1:43:12] to keep on preaching it I'm going to
[1:43:14] keep on pointing you in that direction
[1:43:15] because I believe God sent us a master
[1:43:19] builder
[1:43:26] look at it would not a god-called pastor
[1:43:30] that's straight on the word and taught
[1:43:33] the word for years and been faithful as
[1:43:35] posed to Beauty
[1:43:36] well not he be a man that God would be
[1:43:39] able to use to influence other brother
[1:43:41] that think they're called to be pastors
[1:43:44] how can an evangelist tell a pastor how
[1:43:47] to do this now God's Prophet said in
[1:43:49] evangelist said never tell a pastor what
[1:43:51] to even do
[1:43:52] ah so I said
[1:43:56] but we're so scared to death to take any
[1:43:58] instruction
[1:44:00] what a shame
[1:44:02] can you imagine the wisdom
[1:44:06] the battles the scars that brother Tim
[1:44:08] Pruitt has had through the years
[1:44:13] passed on the church for I guess going
[1:44:14] on 50 years something like that
[1:44:16] preaching for almost that long
[1:44:19] can you imagine all that he's been
[1:44:21] through is he perfect of course not
[1:44:23] but how much has he been through that he
[1:44:26] could hand down to others but we're
[1:44:29] scared to death of it
[1:44:35] oh my
[1:44:38] notice verse 23 and I'll close
[1:44:42] now one thing about this other brother
[1:44:43] was
[1:44:45] preach different
[1:44:47] ahola had
[1:44:50] his specialty was weaving
[1:44:54] and embroidery
[1:44:56] we've had a few preachers out that
[1:44:58] embroidered us didn't they
[1:45:03] so this other brother was more in the
[1:45:05] aspect of the metallurgical side
[1:45:08] is it amazing now God could give this
[1:45:10] one man all of this whole thing but he
[1:45:11] decided to separate it
[1:45:13] now he's going to make both of these
[1:45:15] brothers teachers now with him was a
[1:45:17] whole to have the son of a shemek and
[1:45:19] the tribe of damn an engraver
[1:45:22] and a cunning Workman and an embroiderer
[1:45:26] in blue and in purple
[1:45:30] and discard it
[1:45:32] and then finally well why not just take
[1:45:34] an old piece of canvas and fill her just
[1:45:36] get no grass sack just get an old grass
[1:45:38] sack pick up something off the side of
[1:45:39] the street just throw it up on the side
[1:45:41] but got a little crooked stick on this
[1:45:42] side and they got them cherubims laying
[1:45:44] over and they're saying about my kids
[1:45:45] one of them says anything that way but
[1:45:47] we're humble we're humble
[1:45:50] anything with any shine to it oh that's
[1:45:53] of the devil
[1:45:56] and the pavement in the city you're
[1:45:57] going to walk on is pure gold
[1:46:00] and the gates are going to walk through
[1:46:02] are created pearls
[1:46:06] come on Saints
[1:46:08] oh my goodness
[1:46:11] you got them pictures ready for me
[1:46:18] damn house he filled with wisdom of
[1:46:20] heart to work all manner of work of the
[1:46:22] engraver and the cunning Workman and the
[1:46:26] embroidering blue and in purple and
[1:46:27] Scarlet and fine linen and of the Weaver
[1:46:30] even of them that do any work and those
[1:46:32] that devise cunning work now the
[1:46:35] ordinary Weaver
[1:46:37] would have wove
[1:46:39] all the fabric in one color
[1:46:43] the gifted Weaver
[1:46:45] would take blue
[1:46:48] Scarlet
[1:46:49] White
[1:46:51] and to do that you had to calculate so
[1:46:54] you're going to put the image of a
[1:46:55] cherubim you're going to put an image
[1:46:57] inside this embroidery work you've got
[1:46:59] to sit there and figure out how to do it
[1:47:02] so are the three gods or are there one
[1:47:04] and they come up to one every time
[1:47:07] and then they got to looking well is
[1:47:09] there an eight-day messenger said no
[1:47:11] there's only one two three four five six
[1:47:13] seven ages so they could only be seven
[1:47:16] Messengers so they had to count all that
[1:47:19] in order to make the picture look just
[1:47:21] exactly right you got to know how to
[1:47:23] count aren't y'all glad you finally
[1:47:24] learned how to count
[1:47:26] how in the world can one plus one plus
[1:47:29] one equals one but only in Divine
[1:47:31] understanding can the manifestation of a
[1:47:33] father the manifestation of a sign and
[1:47:35] the manifestation of the Holy Ghost only
[1:47:37] wind up of being one God
[1:47:39] and somebody said the skillful Weaver
[1:47:42] then produced a pattern and this is
[1:47:45] three classes of men and I'm gonna close
[1:47:47] three classes of workers which were men
[1:47:50] they were this now what's in what they
[1:47:53] did but then there was another category
[1:47:56] Exodus 35 25.
[1:47:59] and they
[1:48:01] were women
[1:48:05] ah
[1:48:06] you mean the women even get to do
[1:48:08] something
[1:48:10] and all the women that were wise hearted
[1:48:15] did span on the rumor mill no I mean
[1:48:18] whoa whoa
[1:48:22] did spin with their hands and brought
[1:48:27] which they had spun both a blue and the
[1:48:31] purple and of scarlet and a fine linen
[1:48:34] and all the women whose heart stirred
[1:48:37] them up in wisdom spun
[1:48:45] so the women did the spinning
[1:48:48] and the dime
[1:48:49] now remember according to the Bible they
[1:48:52] were to make a Brazen labor and his foot
[1:48:57] so God told Moses now it sat on the
[1:49:00] outside and that is whenever they come
[1:49:02] in
[1:49:02] they would take their foot
[1:49:04] and kick on the little lever down at the
[1:49:06] bottom
[1:49:07] then they would bend over and wash their
[1:49:10] hands and their feet before they go into
[1:49:13] worship
[1:49:14] now what was this signifying their walk
[1:49:17] with God they was only anointed One Time
[1:49:19] by the prophet of God they were priests
[1:49:21] from that time on so they didn't have to
[1:49:23] get reanointed again or saved again but
[1:49:26] they didn't need their hands and feet
[1:49:28] washed
[1:49:29] this is another reason why we need to
[1:49:31] come to church
[1:49:32] so we don't come to church to be told
[1:49:34] how good we are how sweet we are how
[1:49:37] nice we are and everything like that
[1:49:39] we'll come to church to get Washed by
[1:49:41] the Water of the word because we're out
[1:49:44] there in this dark filthy sinful world
[1:49:46] and we get up spirits on us if we're not
[1:49:49] careful and we'll get you know this idea
[1:49:51] and that idea so what do we need to do
[1:49:53] man of God to kick that thing on and get
[1:49:55] your hands down there and wash them all
[1:49:57] and wash your feet then what you're
[1:49:59] getting ready to worship praise God
[1:50:01] that's why some of you come in here and
[1:50:03] say you're like a bump on a pickle and
[1:50:05] you ain't washed from the water of all
[1:50:07] the filths of the world out there but
[1:50:09] God when you know what that labor was
[1:50:11] made out of
[1:50:13] the women's looking glasses
[1:50:18] now they didn't have mirrors like we do
[1:50:20] today sisters
[1:50:22] their mirrors were made out of burnished
[1:50:25] or polished brass didn't have glass like
[1:50:28] we did
[1:50:29] so that polished polished Polish Polish
[1:50:31] that piece of metal until they could
[1:50:33] hold it up and see their self and them
[1:50:35] women gave their mirrors
[1:50:39] to this man here and this man poured it
[1:50:42] in a furnace and smelted it I melted it
[1:50:46] and it became the very vessel that was
[1:50:50] used to wash their own priest
[1:50:53] so they supply to the ministry the very
[1:50:57] thing that the ministry needed in order
[1:51:00] to bring your sacrifice to the house of
[1:51:04] God
[1:51:05] Oh Glory to God now if that man had not
[1:51:09] have done that God would have killed him
[1:51:10] is that right God said let them wash
[1:51:13] their hands on their feet there at lest
[1:51:15] they die and Who provided the brass you
[1:51:18] did
[1:51:19] so you gave your breasts you gave your
[1:51:23] mirror you gave your ability to no
[1:51:26] longer see yourself
[1:51:29] but see yourself identified in the
[1:51:32] Tabernacle Oh Glory to God I'm not
[1:51:36] saying sister don't quit combing your
[1:51:38] hair and don't quit taking a shower and
[1:51:39] all that sort of thing it's in the
[1:51:41] nature of a woman she wants to look
[1:51:42] pretty that's all right but don't put
[1:51:44] that vanity in front of the house of God
[1:51:46] don't put that make it a vain thing your
[1:51:48] words you just almost worshiped yourself
[1:51:50] but you imagine they sacrificed the
[1:51:53] ability to see themself and every time
[1:51:56] the priest would go into the house of
[1:51:59] God with their sacrifice
[1:52:01] the priests would wash
[1:52:03] and something they contributed
[1:52:11] listen
[1:52:13] show them a couple of pictures our
[1:52:15] brothers
[1:52:19] artists Renditions of course
[1:52:24] of what the Tabernacle would have looked
[1:52:25] like
[1:52:27] ah
[1:52:29] does anybody know what that gold color
[1:52:31] is on the walls
[1:52:34] it's not Crayola
[1:52:39] it is not Sherwin-Williams paint
[1:52:43] it is chateemwood overlaid
[1:52:48] and pure gold
[1:52:52] the menorah seven Branch Candlestick
[1:52:55] solid gold
[1:52:58] the altar of incense for the priests is
[1:53:01] standing City wood overlaid
[1:53:04] in gold
[1:53:06] they are the Covenant
[1:53:09] wood humanity overlaid and gold
[1:53:12] signifying our lord Jesus
[1:53:15] at the current cost
[1:53:17] of Gold Silver and these things today
[1:53:22] over 30 million
[1:53:25] dollars
[1:53:29] you ever seen a storefront look like
[1:53:31] that
[1:53:35] so you see the people who think all big
[1:53:39] churches are of the devil really
[1:53:42] so what is heaven like a 12 a 12
[1:53:47] 14 by 14 so you and your two children
[1:53:49] and you know your favorite cousin and
[1:53:51] uncle and y'all going to get y'all gonna
[1:53:54] live in that 1500 Mile City
[1:53:56] I hate to interrupt your party but
[1:53:59] you're going to hear somebody one day
[1:54:00] down there screaming to the top of their
[1:54:02] voice it's going to be me and brother
[1:54:04] Dave and brother Jonathan brother Fred
[1:54:05] and brother Daniel and sister so and so
[1:54:07] and we're all down there and we we heard
[1:54:09] another voice louder the notion who it
[1:54:11] is brother Branham he's down there
[1:54:12] screaming with us
[1:54:15] you ain't getting rid of me friends
[1:54:16] you're stuck with me for eternity
[1:54:19] like it or not
[1:54:27] No Doubt
[1:54:29] this couldn't even
[1:54:31] be a drop in the bucket as we'd say of
[1:54:34] the beauty can you imagine when the
[1:54:36] Shekinah the Shekinah as we call it
[1:54:38] would come in
[1:54:39] and Sparkle over that altar
[1:54:42] and a flash on them golden walls
[1:54:49] our carpet looks pretty puny after all
[1:54:53] stinking old Walnut
[1:54:56] sound panels wow
[1:55:03] look at this
[1:55:06] look at this
[1:55:08] look at what God's doing around the
[1:55:10] world not just in this
[1:55:12] what is he making around the world and
[1:55:15] he has Fine artisans
[1:55:17] who study and stay alone with God
[1:55:20] they come out of there from the presence
[1:55:21] of the Lord I know you believe it the
[1:55:24] same spirit of God who gave these
[1:55:26] brothers that it's the same one that
[1:55:28] anoints me it's the same one that
[1:55:30] anoints brother Daryl and these other
[1:55:31] preachers the same one that anointed
[1:55:33] Brother David Siler when he's still here
[1:55:34] during the meeting and brother Tim
[1:55:36] Curtin brother on you believe that it's
[1:55:38] the same spirit of God except now it's
[1:55:39] not in gold and silver and purple and
[1:55:42] all that sort of thing but it's to build
[1:55:44] up the house of God
[1:55:47] to take you out of this world where does
[1:55:49] gold come from the dirt where does
[1:55:51] silver come from the dirt where does all
[1:55:54] these precious things come from the dirt
[1:55:56] and they have to go through a process in
[1:55:58] order to make it look like this it
[1:56:00] doesn't look like this initially neither
[1:56:02] do we
[1:56:03] but through the process God turns us
[1:56:06] into the Tabernacle of God
[1:56:09] praise the Lord
[1:56:12] asparagus together
[1:56:15] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:56:20] thank you Holy Father
[1:56:24] Lord God what an awesome God you are
[1:56:28] what a beautiful story
[1:56:30] you have laid before us this night
[1:56:34] the parallels and the types
[1:56:37] so beautiful father
[1:56:39] thank you
[1:56:41] so the same spirit of God that moved
[1:56:44] upon these men
[1:56:45] and gave them this great ability
[1:56:48] it's the same spirit of God
[1:56:51] that moved right there in our prophet's
[1:56:53] house
[1:56:56] from the very first service
[1:56:59] and the series of the seals
[1:57:02] God hiding himself in Simplicity than
[1:57:04] the breach
[1:57:05] first through the seventh The Sixth Seal
[1:57:08] question answers on the seals and the
[1:57:10] seventh seal
[1:57:11] Sunday night
[1:57:14] the same spirit of God began to open and
[1:57:16] pull back the seals of things that have
[1:57:19] been kept secret
[1:57:21] since the foundation of the world
[1:57:24] so you sent a master builder to this age
[1:57:28] many men have come and gone
[1:57:31] many men will stand before you at that
[1:57:34] day and answer
[1:57:35] for dividing and splitting and
[1:57:37] separating the message people
[1:57:39] having all kinds of doctrines
[1:57:42] that's divided the people around the
[1:57:44] world
[1:57:46] now Lord we're as divided as the
[1:57:48] denominations are
[1:57:50] message people won't even speak to one
[1:57:52] another
[1:57:54] they won't even visit one another have
[1:57:56] nothing to do with one another
[1:57:59] help us God
[1:58:00] we can't really say nothing about the
[1:58:02] denominations and words divided as they
[1:58:04] are
[1:58:06] but that don't change the program
[1:58:09] that don't change the building you're
[1:58:11] going to have a bride that's going to
[1:58:13] love in spite of everything
[1:58:16] it doesn't mean we go along with people
[1:58:19] but many people judge loving people by
[1:58:22] going along with them
[1:58:24] but they've got love backwards
[1:58:26] you love those that hated you
[1:58:29] you love those that crossed you and went
[1:58:32] against you you love them anyway
[1:58:35] so father help us to know that human
[1:58:38] love is the conditional love well I'll
[1:58:41] love you if you like me I'll love you
[1:58:44] you'll be good to me and it don't take
[1:58:46] us long in talking to people in this day
[1:58:48] and we can tell whether or not they like
[1:58:50] people or dislike them and if they'll
[1:58:52] talk long enough they'll understand why
[1:58:54] and for most of them it's because that
[1:58:56] person crossed them somehow or didn't
[1:58:58] treat them right
[1:59:00] and they will base their love on the
[1:59:02] treatment of that person which is not
[1:59:04] Divine love at all
[1:59:06] so you were hanging on the cross and you
[1:59:08] prayed for those Sinners who had
[1:59:10] crucified you father forgive them
[1:59:14] for they know not what they do they
[1:59:17] never even ask you for forgiveness
[1:59:20] but that's real love
[1:59:22] that's real Godly love that we can
[1:59:26] forgive those
[1:59:27] that don't even ask us to
[1:59:31] O Lord help us father I pray
[1:59:35] help me Jesus as the pastor
[1:59:38] Lord help these other ministers your
[1:59:40] father
[1:59:41] that we will study and stay in the
[1:59:44] presence of God
[1:59:46] and get what's needed for this building
[1:59:49] help these brothers as they go out and
[1:59:51] preach in other churches Lord that they
[1:59:54] will be quickened by your spirit
[1:59:56] and you will lead them Lord for what
[1:59:59] needs to be brought for the services
[2:00:01] well they go
[2:00:03] oh Father not for our Glory not for our
[2:00:06] benefit but for the kingdom of Jesus
[2:00:09] Christ
[2:00:10] may we not preach ourselves but may we
[2:00:14] preach Christ Jesus
[2:00:17] Hallelujah
[2:00:19] Hallelujah
[2:00:21] don't you love him children with all
[2:00:23] your heart
[2:00:25] now look God did the opposite to you
[2:00:28] to what was done to those boards that
[2:00:31] you saw on the Tabernacle
[2:00:33] God
[2:00:35] there God had the goal which represented
[2:00:37] deity put on the outside and the
[2:00:40] humanity the wood was on the inside but
[2:00:44] God in building this Tabernacle since
[2:00:46] Messias has come
[2:00:49] God started with the gold on the inside
[2:00:52] and the humanity on the outside
[2:00:56] and I don't care how hard you try you
[2:00:58] will never perfect your Humanity
[2:01:02] it's going to bother you but thank God
[2:01:04] it does you're going to be aggravated
[2:01:06] with it you're not even going to like it
[2:01:08] at times those times I don't even like
[2:01:11] myself none
[2:01:13] and there's other times I just think I'm
[2:01:15] such a great person
[2:01:17] don't stand there and look at me like a
[2:01:18] hypocrite you do yourself the same way
[2:01:20] who did you feed before you come to
[2:01:22] church yourself or your wife
[2:01:24] who did you close it's in us to protect
[2:01:28] ourselves and God put the gold on the
[2:01:31] inside and that's the outside the
[2:01:34] humanity still be this whole chatime
[2:01:36] would oh my
[2:01:38] God how many wants to be more like the
[2:01:40] Lord Jesus how many wants to love like
[2:01:43] he loved
[2:01:45] and want to need one another more come
[2:01:47] on now you want to recognize I need my
[2:01:51] brothers and sisters at our church I
[2:01:53] need them I need them now that don't
[2:01:55] mean you'll always be the very best of
[2:01:57] Pals there's some folks I don't care how
[2:01:58] hard you try you'll never be compatible
[2:02:01] in the flesh but you can still love one
[2:02:04] another so much from your soul you just
[2:02:07] love that brother and sister though you
[2:02:09] may not spend a lot of personal time
[2:02:11] with them you know there's preachers
[2:02:12] that I love them but they're just not my
[2:02:15] buddies they're not my Chums they're
[2:02:17] just not pals you know what I'm saying
[2:02:18] because the atmosphere they creates
[2:02:21] different than the one that I create
[2:02:22] that's why we all got to be changed if
[2:02:25] not heaven will be just like our church
[2:02:27] in about two weeks time
[2:02:29] some of you all be in one click over
[2:02:31] there and some of you young people will
[2:02:32] be on another Street on the other side
[2:02:34] and then there'll be certain young
[2:02:35] people that won't be on that click so
[2:02:37] they'll be on the other side no we've
[2:02:39] all got to be changed from clicks
[2:02:43] would you lay your hand on one another
[2:02:45] tonight
[2:02:47] let's pray for one another
[2:02:49] that God will give us more love
[2:02:52] and more Unity
[2:02:54] than we've ever had in our lives
[2:02:57] Hallelujah
[2:03:00] Lord Jesus we have our hands
[2:03:03] one upon the other
[2:03:07] we could ask you tonight for gifts
[2:03:10] we could ask you tonight for healing and
[2:03:12] we've done that before and we may do
[2:03:15] that before we stop
[2:03:17] but Lord I'm asking for something
[2:03:19] tonight that
[2:03:21] I believe is so needed Among Us
[2:03:25] allow for each other
[2:03:28] a recognition
[2:03:30] that we need each other
[2:03:33] and Satan does his best to try to
[2:03:35] convince us we don't need each other and
[2:03:38] cause us to pull away
[2:03:39] and pull away from the church and pull
[2:03:42] away from each other I don't need nobody
[2:03:44] ain't nobody locks me up there and then
[2:03:46] we go to pulling ourself away that ain't
[2:03:48] nothing but the devil
[2:03:51] Lord I pray you would help us tonight
[2:03:53] father
[2:03:54] may we love one another more than we've
[2:03:56] ever loved in our lives
[2:03:59] Lord not only the people of our church
[2:04:01] but Lord God loving Humanity
[2:04:05] if they ever needed love they sure need
[2:04:07] it now
[2:04:08] that don't mean that we go along with
[2:04:10] our sin father
[2:04:12] we love the sinner but we hate their sin
[2:04:16] father I pray that you would help each
[2:04:18] of us in our assembly Lord God that we
[2:04:21] can recognize we need one another as we
[2:04:23] looked up here at this artist's
[2:04:25] rendition of the the Tabernacle there
[2:04:28] was one board by another by another by
[2:04:31] another
[2:04:33] the interior of this Tabernacle was not
[2:04:36] made out of one piece of wood there was
[2:04:38] not a tree big enough to do such
[2:04:41] but it was one plank by another plank by
[2:04:45] another plank buy another plank but put
[2:04:48] them together and then make the house of
[2:04:50] God
[2:04:52] oh Jesus
[2:04:54] Put Me by this brother put this one by
[2:04:56] that brother by this sister but that
[2:04:58] brother but this sister then Lord God
[2:05:00] put us together and we'll make the house
[2:05:03] of God
[2:05:05] for God to have a place that he can
[2:05:07] dwell
[2:05:09] for perfect worship
[2:05:11] perfect worship
[2:05:14] is God
[2:05:16] in flesh
[2:05:18] how can I ever know how to worship you
[2:05:21] unless you in me
[2:05:24] teaches me how
[2:05:26] you want to be worshiped and loved
[2:05:30] we'll do it our way every time
[2:05:33] according to our background according to
[2:05:34] what Obama says what her daddy said well
[2:05:36] honey you do it this way you do it that
[2:05:38] way or you don't get too loud or if you
[2:05:40] ain't screaming you ain't doing it but
[2:05:42] only you can really teach us how to
[2:05:44] worship
[2:05:45] so you living in US
[2:05:48] this is why some people don't worship no
[2:05:50] more than they do because they've never
[2:05:52] been taught personally by you
[2:05:54] that worship is not hinged upon the song
[2:05:57] leader worship is not hinged upon the
[2:06:00] preacher saying all right now let's
[2:06:01] everybody worship
[2:06:03] but if God is in our hearts and we're
[2:06:06] yielded to God we worship for the song
[2:06:08] leader worships or not
[2:06:10] we worship whether the preacher worships
[2:06:13] or not
[2:06:14] because The God Who Wants to be
[2:06:16] worshiped lives in the worship her soul
[2:06:19] all glory to God God's Own desire to be
[2:06:23] worship pulls praise out of my mouth
[2:06:27] God's Own desire to be worshiped and
[2:06:31] adored and magnified pulls it out of my
[2:06:34] mouth so now I may be so low I cannot
[2:06:37] even raise my voice but the Lord God
[2:06:40] from within my soul will take my human
[2:06:43] lips
[2:06:44] and speak praise and love and adoration
[2:06:48] Hallelujah for that's what we were made
[2:06:51] for Lord
[2:06:53] Lord God make us to be a house of God
[2:06:57] oh this is your house Lord
[2:07:01] all the building all the planning all
[2:07:04] that we've done Lord that we might could
[2:07:06] have this place

[2:07:14] Lord we've already seen you do so many
[2:07:16] things there's been so many miracles so
[2:07:18] many healings so many baptisms that
[2:07:20] we've already seen take place I believe
[2:07:22] we've yet to see the greatest
[2:07:24] Hallelujah we thank you for it Lord now

[2:07:29] will have them in years we thank you for
[2:07:31] it Lord but oh God this ain't the only

[2:16:57] let's just give him some love
[2:17:00] praise the Lord do you know that there's

[2:17:27] it
[2:17:28] what you think about him
[2:17:31] Angels can't do that
[2:17:33] they've not been redeemed
[2:17:36] if you can understand it
[2:17:39] They Don't Love
[2:17:41] the way a child of God loves
[2:17:44] I preached it for years and believed it
[2:17:47] and I told Carol the other day I was
[2:17:49] always afraid
[2:17:51] that somebody was going to question me
[2:17:53] on this thing that I preached
[2:17:56] because I'd never found a quote for it
[2:17:59] I could see it
[2:18:01] but I needed a quote
[2:18:03] I'd always preach that Satan didn't love
[2:18:06] his own people
[2:18:08] and he didn't love the world and the
[2:18:10] people of the world that serve him
[2:18:13] but I found a quote the other day where
[2:18:15] brother Branham said Satan
[2:18:18] cannot love
[2:18:21] and I was out wow one of the many many
[2:18:24] things that makes him so different than
[2:18:27] our lord Jesus so when you was living
[2:18:29] for the devil he didn't care one thing
[2:18:31] about you he didn't love you he didn't
[2:18:35] love you not one bit he can't love
[2:18:38] but look what the Bible says about God
[2:18:41] for God is love
[2:18:46] praise God so what ought we to be we
[2:18:50] ought to be loved too
[2:18:52] we are his children
[2:18:54] sing something for us hey let's just
[2:18:56] love him just a little bit now
