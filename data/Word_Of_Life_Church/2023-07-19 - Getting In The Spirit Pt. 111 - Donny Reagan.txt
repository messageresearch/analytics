her box of alabaster and I've come to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's Alabaster Box don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and drive him with my hair you weren't there the night he

sin that had me bound [Music] and I spent my days poured my life without measure into a little treasure box I thought I'd found found until the day when Jesus came to me and healed my soul with the

praise the Lord well if that's not our determination we're done whooped anyway we've got to be more determined than we've ever been before by the grace of God Satan will try everything he can to stop us and if you're stoppable you will be stopped but if you can't be stopped ended up Devil's out of hell yeah there ain't enough people there ain't even enough angels to stop you because you're unstoppable praise the Lord amen oh I was so happy man they said unto us let us go into the house of the Lord God bless you let's turn together tonight if you would the first Samuel chapter 15 verse 17. are you happy to be in the house of God let's read this together and Samuel said when that was little and thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord Anointed The King over Israel and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then did US thou not obey the voice of the Lord but did us fly upon the soul the spoil into this evil and the sight of the Lord and Saul said unto Samuel yea I have obeyed the voice of the Lord so we got the prophet saying one thing and when God saw saying something different and apparently it's totally convinced that he did well I'll tell you the most deceiving thing that there is in the world is the human heart yours and mine that's right a lot of us can catch people when they're trying to deceive us but our greatest deception we have to watch out for is US Jeremiah said who can know the heart you know it's the truth notice what he says whenever he says this and Saul said unto Samuel hey I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites let's pray together Heavenly Father we love you tonight we're thankful Lord Jesus for your word we thank you for your presence that we feel your lord tonight thank you and the Psalms and in the worship it's awesome to be in your presence Lord God we thank you for that it's life-changing and the word We Believe It's Not only life-changing but after a while it's going to be body changing we thank you for the opportunity that we can be gathered here and we pray for each one that's here we pray for those who would love to be and cannot be here many different ones dealing with sicknesses and things in their bodies and Lord we just called her the requests before your father were certainly feeling burdened for brother Daryl and Lord God he's prayed for many of us whenever we've been sick and going through things and we want to pray for him tonight Lord I know father is back has been so bad this time lord and father even told me today he was having to crawl because he was in so much pain standing upright so he's been having to get down on his hands and knees and crawl but I pray the spirit of God would move for our brother in the name of Jesus may this thing leave him Lord dear God so many needs and requests and we're just asking that you would take care of them all tonight father so speak to us from your word may we be benefited as we've gathered here tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you Saints you may be seated you know one of the greatest battles that you'll ever have in Life or I'll ever have in life is being able to find our position and then once we find it staying in it it may seem simple to you well we just find what we're supposed to do and it ain't no big deal but when you really look at it it's one of the greatest battles of life you see the reason that God so desires for us is his people to find our position and stay therein is because that's the very opposite of what Satan's program was in the very beginning Lucifer was not as we know him today of course he was the light bringer Day star a couple different synonyms are the meaning of his name and he was not created the devil he was not created Satan but he was created Lucifer but he he got out of his position out of his place now what what happened when he got out of his place he was not happy being out of his place by himself so he went over in the north side of heaven and he started preaching to a bunch of angels now remember they'd never sinned they never stole they'd never done anything wrong in their existence we don't even know how long they live up to this time might have been he owns of Ages it might have been hundreds of thousands of years and they was righteous before God and they praise God and they worshiped him and they loved him that's what they were made to do but Satan began to preach to them one out of his position begin to preach to others to try to pull them out of their position so then these angels left their position so every devil that we fight every demon Spirit Out of Hell at one time was an angel of God they were holy they were righteous they were pure they were sinless they worshiped God they even loved God they served God and serve God's purpose for a time but then they left their position what happens when he brings it on the earth then he comes and he gets inside the thing that was the closest to the man which was the serpent had a place for a soul but didn't have a soul so he talks him out of his place he submits his body to the devil Satan steps inside this body and he wants to use this body for what reason to get somebody else out of their place which was who Eve so what did he do he talked her out of her position once he got her out of her place she was not satisfied being out of her position so she wanted to get somebody else out of their position now you realize that's exactly what Satan wants to do to all of us as the people of God he'll never be happy by getting one person in the church out of their place but he'll want to get that one and that one and that one and this one and that one same thing in the family Satan will never be happy and satisfied by just saying getting a father out of his position but he'll want to get the father he'll want to get the mother he'll want to get his son he'll want to get a daughter he'll want to get a granddaughter why Satan loves to pull people out of their position why because he knows it tears everything around that individual totally completely apart and it will turn their whole world as it were upside down so whenever Satan found this in the beginning and he saw the consequence that it brought so he could never make God turn against his son he could never make God do anything in the form of judgment against his son but if it could ever get his son and his daughter out of their position that would force the hand of God to do something that Satan wanted God to do all along but he couldn't make God do that himself but if he could talk the son and daughter into doing it then it would bring a penalty from God upon their lives now you know that God did not want to drive them out of the Garden of Eden it broke his heart it made God feel no doubt I absolutely just so torn apart and the prophet said he couldn't even stand in himself if they were not going to be in the Garden of Eden he didn't even want to be there himself so when Adam and Eve left guess what God vacated the garden himself and God has never been back as a matter of fact the Garden of Eden has been lost it was in the land of Egypt and they've never found it to this day why the garden is not a garden without God's children being there he knows what it's like to be alone and he ain't going to be alone again so how important is it then that every one of us beginning with me being the pastor of the church every Deacon ever trustee every member of the church ever song leader every musician all of those that hold offices every one of us to find our position now as a child of God your position has many aspects first of all you're in Christ Jesus as an individual in Christ Jesus you stand alone you have your own baptism of the Holy Ghost you have your own walk you have your own disposition and the spiritual economy of God but then you're not in Christ alone in the sense that he has a mystical body then he has a local body and then you find your place in that body and there if you're a singer you sing if you're a piano player you play if you're a deacon you do what a Deacon's supposed to do and Satan will fight you from the time you find your place until the day you're dead to try to get you out of that position anybody going to preach with me tonight but I believe there's one of the scriptures of the people of God that was prophesied in The Book of Joel and it is a prophecy of the last day and it was about a mighty Army that would rise in the last day and one of the great significant senses of this Army was they would not break their ranks now notice this is a prophetic utterance of the last day of the army of God so every member will be in Christ and they will be in the body where God positions them and they will not break the ring now he understands what that means breaking your Reign so it would be as if though that we would take it safe from the natural sense of our military then a man would be will say a five-star general well a guy that just come in the Army last week There's no way that he's going to be able to break Rank and say you know what I'm tired of being about private I don't nobody recognizes me and my pay is right on the bottom I'm and I'm as low as you can go there ain't nobody lower than me except the dog I saw I turned the parking lot everybody else in here is above me and I'm tired of it so I'm going to be a five-star general I want when I come around for people to salute me I want them to say sir I want them to this and that and the other I'm fixing to break my ring no what you're fixing to do is get your nose broke because they're fixing to discipline you like you have never had a whooping in your life because you're not fit you're not qualified to go from a week in the Army to being a five-star general somebody say Amen well you see it's the same way in the army of God that God chooses whom he will now I know a lot of folks don't believe in the ministry but thank God they'll really like do and the prophet tells us in 1962 putting on the whole Army of God that God has placed in his body commanding officers now he doesn't just say those words and leave us to guess at what those commanding officers are but he goes to identifying them by position Apostles prophets pastors evangelists and teachers and he said those are God's commanding officers then that don't mean they're better than the laity it don't mean that they're you know they're going to live on the other side of heaven and it's going to be brighter golden more sunshine and better this and better that no they're actually servants to the rest of the body but yet God wants an army that will be able to each one find their position by The Calling of God now they asked for the man of a very simple question he had a great profound question and the question actually and they said brother Branham Hound us one find their position in Christ Jesus he said well generally brother sister your position is made known by the Holy Spirit revealing it to you and then it's also identified by whether you can do it or not so he said if a man claims that he's called to be a teacher watch how he interprets the word now watch watch how he interprets the word now he tells us again a question that's your six you want he says a man that says that he's called to be a pastor well he said a pastor cannot be a flighty person he's got to be a calm stable so he gives us identifications to be able to identify what the rank will be now he said myself I always thought it was be good to be a pastor he said that I never was a good pastor and never will be he said because I got this Roman Spirit on me now not r-o-m-a-n but r-o-a-m-i-n-g roaming spirit and he said I'm here today and gone come on I'm out there cutting the grass and I look at that airplane flying across the sky and I say where y'all going I want to go with you now he said but God has those that are pastors praise the Lord so God has those that are evangelists God has those that are musicians deacons whatever they are and every one of us will fight the devil to be able to find what our position is and once we find what our position is we'll fight the devil to be able to keep our position and be able to be satisfied when we find ourselves among others who hold the same rank but might be given more gifts than what we do now you see we might look at men that are generals I'll just okay with this same thought and there might be some of them and they fought in a right and they fought here and there and there and more you look at them and they got Metals Metals Metals metals and they're you're standing you're saying my goodness might look like they come from Big Lots you know I got them out of the candy machine I turned the front I paid 25 cent speech for it and I'm standing there if we're not careful we will tend to think well I'm nobody I'm absolutely nothing because I don't have all the great art and general armor and all the great Awards and this and that and the other you understand what we're doing when we do that we are questioning God's own choice himself it's not us that makes ourselves corporals or sergeants or whatever we are it's almighty God that makes us there and there is such great contentment one we find who we are and we don't have to go around comparing well I wish I could preach that's so and so I wish I was like so-and-so be what God has made you and be the best that you can be and that's all you'll have to answer for something about the human being we always always want to be more or depending on who you are some folks always want to be less you know so it's either more or less so it's like we're never satisfied been what God has made us and we can find here the setting of King Saul as we looked at it last week that song had that anointed king and song in his spirit and his makeup and his mentality was actually an epitome of the people you look at the leaders of the day and you'll get a pretty good idea of the economy of the people of the day look at our people in the White House it'll tell you a lot about where our nation is look at the governors look at the people that they elect to run the country and if we got a bunch of stinkers in the White House well more than likely will God sinkers in their house too because they vote that in well praise the Lord and that's really what they want do you think an honest man would ever be able to get off the ground running for president he's thank a man that would tell the truth a man that would really stand for the principles of what our constitution our Bill of Rights and so on was established on you reckon that man would get 500 votes you reckon they get a thousand why most people wouldn't have nothing for that guy they want a man and other disliked himself they want a shyster they want a liar they want a hypocrite they want a two-faced politician and they know he's lying to him he makes them all these promises if you vote for me I'll tell you what I'll make it so easy on you I'll I'll do this and that and the other and they've been lied to since they've been knee-high to a grasshopper and they know them God's lies and yet they just more they rally around them guys and they get in there and what do they do exact opposite of what they said they're going to do and someone will turn right back around and vote a man for a second term I mean we are asking for it aren't we and we we are absolutely asking for it but Saul was the epitome of the type of people in that age and they were a people that had rejected God's leadership God's leadership is going to be him being the king among them and he would be able to dictate through the word of God of a prophet they didn't need a kid but they said we want a king like everybody else we want to be like everybody we want a church like everybody else we want a preacher like everybody else you sure got the wrong one here ain't you we want songs like everybody else we want to live like everybody else so that means you want to go to hell with everybody else too oh my goodness not me I'm willing to be different myself I'm willing to have to sacrifice and give up whatever I need to do to escape hell yep it's worth it to me I think it's worth it to you too so what God had done was chose a man that started out as Samuel said to him that when you were little in your own sight now notice the people that no doubt already rallied around him and tried to lift him up Satan always does that to Men of God but it won't really bother the man of God himself what the people say until he begins to think in the same thing about himself well you know what I have got a little bit more than what my brothers do I'm a little bit more gifted than other guys and our church is a little bit bigger and there's a few more folks that stream our service and stream the other guy and the other guy you see when those thoughts go start going through a servant of God's heart he's already left that place of humility and is already exalting himself above his brothers now come on Saints you know it's the truth now Saul had actually entered into this place this is not his first time of Disobedience but it's going to be the terminating point to where that he will actually reject God's word I'm going to reject the word god rejects us but what's astounding about this is God rejected him out to this instance but he remained King for years now here he is walking in rejection and yet the blessing of God was still on this man's life because they still won battles they still went through all types of different things completely out of the will of God from that time on but yet he kept his crown he kept a Sloan room he kept his title he kept all that was associated with him and yet the prophet said God has rejected you so if you've been living in that day you're to call Samuel a false prophet because you looked at him and said that man is still a kid the blessing of God is still on his life he goes out there and fights battles and God gives him the Victory and we come back and Shout glory to God hallelujah but according to the word of the Lord God rejected him is that right now notice how the prophet deals with this about our position I would rather know and I want you to listen wanted astounding statement I'd rather know that I was in the will of God if I never spoke to another person then to preach to ten thousand people every night out of the will of God so you need a preacher could preach to ten thousand people every night and be out of the will of God all you have to do is turn down a portion of his word now this is how much that brother Branham loved the will of God and the value that he put on the will of God that He said if it was the will of God for him to never speak again now this should have been really quite a challenge for a preacher because it's in him to speak it's just something there it's beyond him but yet he said if it was the will of God for me to do so I'd rather not speak to another person than I would to stand up before ten thousand people and be out of the will of God I'd rather know the will of God I hope we all feel the same way tonight now notice it goes on to sail down a little bit lower in this paragraph what a privilege to find our place and their abide oh my what a privilege to find our place and their abide remember your life to children of Israel I'm sure the historian says the Book of Joshua it took about 26 years to write that that book so we have beginning in chapter one when God tells him that Moses my servant is dead remember those chapter two we move over to Jericho we move on and on and on for a span of about 26 years and they are fighting and fighting and fighting to get their land then we find it comes to the end of Joshua and moves over into the Book of Judges and then we find what a different setting the people have come in the land and now they're fighting to keep what they got you understand that for many of us we have to lay aside drinking or maybe smoke it or this or that or the other and you think why after I become a Christian but my battles are all over no they're not they just kind of change their actions a little bit then you will fight to keep every inch of the ground that you have gained in Christ Jesus you may fight for your health you may fight for your Revelation you might fight for everything that you've got in Christ Jesus but if it was worth fighting for initially I figure it's worth fighting for to keep it you will in heaven but not until now watch this he says what a privilege to find our place and their abide no matter how the devil shakes and what he says or how he scoffs listen to this simple advice say right straight in the will of God how many is that your desire tonight stay right straight in the will of God look again now he says just look at the Billy grahams in the land today but you know Billy Graham could never take your place I couldn't take Billy's place and he couldn't take mine I can't take yours and you can't take mine you're an individual and God God made you the way you are for some purpose if we would just find our place and then abide there if we try to do something different then we're in somebody else's territory so then if we try to move over into a position that God never called us for wherein somebody else's territory now many of you have heard me preach out and different conventions and churches and things and you know that I preach different whenever I go out I never preach with the same sternness I never preached with the same Authority because I'm not a pastor when I'm in a convention I'm not a pastor what I'm preaching in some other man's church so I will preach different because it's the same man but the administration will come forward in a way I always keep before me this is not my congregation this is not my church so I will preach in a way as a visiting Minister any man with wisdom will do the exact same thing so when men who have wisdom about position come to preach for us and you know them preach at home they will preach different and they should if they don't they still don't understand it yet why because it's a different Administration you know Timothy was actually the pastor of a church and yet Paul told Timothy do the work of an evangelist now he didn't say he was one so Paul wanted Timothy to go out and be able to minister in other places but he wanted him to know when you go out Timothy don't go out and try to Pastor another man's Church well praise the Lord I'm sorry y'all didn't know this if you're not supposed to go out and Pastor another man's church but you go out and you mix a little bit of pasture and a little bit of Doctrine and a little bit of evangelism and then it all heads up hopefully in a good meeting but then if I went out and preached to them the way I preached to you more than I could they wouldn't want me to come back because they're saying he ain't got no right to say that to me and in one sense of the word they're telling the truth and sometimes evangelists have come to our church as a matter of fact there's been a few I've had to talk to because they come to our church and it's almost like they acted like they was the pastor and to me they crossed a line a certain place well come on now now let me ask you folks that still got little youngins in your house or maybe big Elements which you want everybody in the church whooping your young ones really you mean y'all have a problem with that y'all have a real problem with it would you okay all right well you see God made a pasture soul that a pastor can wear you out I mean Tire you lamb from limb time every bit of the higher there is off of you and you waddle out to the car and you think glory to God I'm coming back Sunday [Applause] if I can get back Hallelujah that Pastor wore me out then I'm so grateful for a man of God that'll tell me the truth but if an evangelist comes in their steps Beyond his boundary as an evangelist and you know you've said in them types of services before and maybe the Evangelist was saying the truth but he wasn't the one to say it and it just didn't go over right it didn't feel right it didn't work right and at the end of the service it was a little bit aggravated and you wasn't aggravating in a good way why would somebody would preach with me tonight well what was it well you see if we're not careful whenever we go to intermingling in that will cross from one right over into another and it's the same way with the prophet's gift there's only one of them to an age that's going to come like a prophet messenger so Donnie Reagan any other preacher has no right to move into a position of the prophet of the age well praise the lord well Samuel was the prophet of that age Saul had no Authority to look at Samuel's words and try to decide if they were inspired or not oh praise the Lord now I want you to notice how brother Branham identifies this he says then we're in somebody else's territory which we just gone don't you love that word gum we gum up the picture of God so you mean simply moving saying evangelists moving out of his territory and he's in a visiting in a church and he moves over into a pastor saying now that anointing is here I didn't know anything she was a pastor I hope you understand that that's going to be harder for an advantageous than what you realize because that anointing is here and you will sit there and take it for a bit and he's got just a small window by which God will merge that over into it and it'll be fine and dandy but if it stays there too long he'll overstep that place and he got over into the pastor's territory and he gums up his sermon and then they wonder sometimes why it don't go over now this invisible lines it's very hard to Define where they are it's very hard when you're out especially when you preach fast you're preaching 90 miles an hour and you're still trying to keep them lines before you so it's like you realize you've got lion shown on both sides and you got to be so careful because she can't cross over well Saul you can see once a person becomes elevated they do away with all the lines then the way they're looking at it they're just as important as a prophet they're just as important as any Pastor anywhere they'll say whatever they want to say but that's God ain't nobody telling them what to say well that's a person that's full of themself they are a stuffed shirt that's what the prophet called them now notice this if you try to take the from your own whatever shape it's in or whatever color it's in you should be able to identify with this if you try to take the bone away from your own man you're just messing up your team guard you're mad see keep guarding him keep the rest of them so he can make the run and we'll have the touchdown so you know what kind of game we're playing this and this spiritual synopsis he's talking about football so then if the man your man whoever it was had got it on your side and oh my word I hear in the grass and well not us because I ain't gonna get out there and break my bones but you all you all are out there running and then your guy grabs a hold of the football here it goes way out oh he's got it he's got oh here he comes here he comes and my everybody Big Pete all these big guys here they come half back quarterback no back little back whatever they're called they get I turn the middle out of my way out of my way well that God he may not be able to run he may have all the muscles he may have all big bones and everything like that but maybe he can't run so fast but this little wiry Johnson he's got the baldy Here Comes little skinny Jonathan if it turns sideways and Rain he can stand under a clothesline and use it for an umbrella I bet here he come that little fella can fly across through there well what a big old Pete said Hey Little John get out of the way man let me have this ball and here comes a big old pee running down through there man he's a gone he's gone and somebody simply puts out their toe and Big Pete goes flat on the ground little Jonathan could have jumped right over the top of it and kept right on The Hobbit but you see we need one another but what we want to put little Jonathan as a guard not unless he's guarding ads what weapon what about little Jonathan to God some 250 pound guy he'd pick him up and swirl him around on his finger but we need some big guys with muscles some guys with some Brawn about him but we might need a little Irish Family Guy that we can throw that ball to and here he goes like greased lightning and they'll say where'd he go where'd he go oh you say I wanted to pack that ball what you want is to win so we want the one Hallelujah that can get us across the line if he does it we all win if you do it and can't do it we all lose [Music] oh of course I know none of our people who play sports are interested really in winning it's just all about playing it's just all about being around for the fellowship you'll go to hell for lying you know these people the spoof you and spam you all the time they get emails and return texts from me probably like no other because everyone under spoofs me I'll send some today I tell them this you go to hell for Life repent repent repent they want your password they want your email address well that's the way it is and reality if we say oh I'm the whole team you you know the whole team you see that's what's wrong with me the messed up people around the message they think they're the whole team that's why they don't have to go to church you're going to get run smack over you're gonna need somebody that can make a touchdown you're going to need somebody that'll stand with you when you don't know what to do I'm so glad I've got people that love me I'm so glad I've got people that pray for me I'm so glad I'm not in this life alone aren't you [Applause] notice how it says this will will have the touchdown after a while and Jesus will come so what if for one touchdown away from the rapture but Samantha message people are fussing over who gets the ball is that what matters is that what matters who gets the last one in Is that what matters who has the most Miracles and who has the most shouting is that really what matters let's make the last one so we can go home I don't know about you I'm sick of this place I'm hating this place worse and worse and worse every day I'm here well have a touchdown after a while and Jesus will come then it will all be over I love the way he says this the Lord bless you so we need these little wiry guys little skinny fellas that can run we need this big brownie guy he takes up two seats well we need him in their big wide shoulders we need people that are sensitive we need people that pray we need people that have a burden for the shut-in we need people that have a burden for those whenever you see somebody and there's been two or three services and they ain't been to church and yes I'm wondering about so and so or so and so reckon where they are well maybe you should call them maybe you should say Hey brother I've been missing your church are you doing okay or you say well I shouldn't do that you shouldn't what should not your body operate in one function so if the liver goes to acting up shouldn't the rest of the body go right toward it and help that body I'll tell you a friend we need one another now more than we have ever needed one another and the devil is going to try his best to tear us apart first Samuel 15 12. when Samuel rose up early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to Carmel and behold watch this now these words he set him up a place now what he's done he's made a memorial he says the words he's made a memorial so he's been out there fabricating and making this this Memorial to what this battle he just won defeating the amalekites so instead of setting up a memorial to God he set him up a place well I'll tell you one thing preachers have to watch this got to go to use them and they'll go to talking about it and talking about if you're not careful you hear them talking about theirself more than anybody else's Ministry and it's like their church is the only one that's alive their church and the message is the only one where God is moving well just in case you're wondering tonight let me let you know our church ain't the only one that has a move of God As a matter of fact there's a move of God all over this world I'm talking about in India and Africa all over the United States at ages two or three different churches oh and everybody's going to flock to them two three churches I want you to show me where God's Prophet taught that I want you to show me what brother Branham would get up and tell people and pull on the people to move to his church and never done no such a thing and I ain't going to do it neither and I don't want you doing it we wanted one here at this church who God wants at this church I don't want them coming here because our music is good I don't want them coming here because we got a new building no if they feel that of the Lord they want to come here on the letter the spirit of God I want them to come because the word is right the spirit is Right lives are being changed forget to build and forget how pretty the music is forget the big Sunday school rooms forget all of that is God there that's what I want to know is God there if they're coming for the word they'll stay if they're coming for for a gift then when the man with the gift dies what happens oh my God so Saul came to Carmel and behold he set him up a place and it's gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgall notice as we look here in verse 13. and Samuel came to Saul and said unto him blessed these thou the Lord oh he's religious any glory to God I have performed the Commandment of the Lord my goodness this is scary friends and Samuel said what meaneth this bleeding of the Sheep man oh well I didn't think he was inspired when you said that quote so I use my better judgment about it and I felt like you know I mean I wasn't really sure if that was the word of the Lord or not because actually uh Samuel Phil remember you never said thus saith the Lord so I thought it would be best if we brought these back as a sacrifice to the Lord I'll tell you friends this cares me when I see the way folks in this message handle this message they cut and slice and pick and choose and if it don't suit them they don't read them it's amazing how many preachers do it I've seen preachers for years decades quotes when they'd be off on this or that or the other you might as well send them bubble gum wrappers It Don't Mean a bit more to them than I said well I don't I don't know what you think about a preacher like that but in my book a preacher like that don't really believe the message anyway if God's Prophet was entrusted to be able to call the bride out for Christ is he not entrusted to tell us how to set a church in order and to tell us how we ought to do this and do that and the other are we going to be like Saul that we're going to exalt our opinion above a Vindicated prophet's message not me well praise the Lord and Samuel said what meaneth this bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen which I hear and Saul said they have brought them from the amalekites thought the people here's the kind of leader he was he couldn't admit he'd miss God you see God tries preachers yeah he tries them he'll give them so much and then he'll try he'll see what they do with it how do they use it how do they Channel it do they Channel it toward them toward their Church toward their name you realize what a lot of men have done friends down to the ages I was thinking about Oral Roberts today and A.A Allen and many different ones that we could name and the era when brother random was here of course Oral Roberts left a university went out to Arizona and Bart uh you know all this property out there in Arizona still there it's still there Miracle Mile so we bought all these Acres out there to be able to establish this place John Alexander Dowry goes to Chicago Illinois for those of you that don't know it the little city there was a little city called Zion Illinois John Alexander dolly was part of the ones who founded that place and it was going to be a heaven on Earth the original part of Zion Illinois all of their streets have biblical names all right brother Joe y'all used to live forever Brother Gary so it was going to be a heaven on Earth what was it it was him building a war memorial and what did he leave sign Illinois and what's it turned into now well it's just a suburb of Chicago just as filthy and rotten as all the rest of what did Oral Roberts University turn into about like any other university well come on somebody and then I got to thinking and what did William Branham build I traveled different parts of this great United States I've seen many bridges many roads many highways named after Billy Graham Oral Roberts this one that one the other I got to thinking that if Pete what was it that God's Prophet left to us a university yeah right was it a great Memorial somewhere did he build a you know 50 million dollar Cathedral we'll go to eighth and Penn Street and you can see so did he leave us a college where we could send the use oh all Roberts University or are you so maybe we'll call this WBU William Branham University but what did he leave us the word of God a restoration back to that word now his gifts superseded all of those men put together had more Supernatural more visitations from God that all of them men put together millions of daughters could have ended his hands at his disposal but he didn't want it why he did not want to build a war memorial I'd done this I accomplished that what did he leave a message a message that would reach to the black the white the red the yellow Hallelujah it would reach across racial barriers it would reach across Financial barriers it would call us together from around the world there has never been nothing like it and never shall be again he did not leave a memorial he left a message a message and then you know what's sad then a bunch of self-centered preachers go to getting in it and what do they do go to building their own memorials oh yeah they call them by different names seventh under this proves you this return this this that the other what is it preachers trying to build himself a memorial brother Donnie what are you going to build I hope it's all of my heart I'm building Sons and Daughters of God I don't want nothing after my name I don't want nothing go for you can remember if I go to the way of the Grave well let's pick up some this and that and the other so we can remember brother Donnie no the greatest honor you can ever do to me is live what I'm preaching and pray and be filled with the Holy Ghost and live a life that is so pleasing to God that when the Rapture comes you go away then we'll stand together that day and I'll be able to present you with the seventh Church age messenger and will walk in under the battical or call it to God of Malachi 4. ah oh my look in first Samuel 15 3 what actually Samuel said now go and smite amalek and utterly destroyed all that they have and spare them not now listen but slay both men and woman infant and serpent ox and sheep camel an ass how he knows he did not do exactly that but he is convinced but somebody's convinced I did what God wanted me to do look at this great Victory Hallelujah I still feel it all over me glory to God well that's that's that's it right there ain't it it's not how much we obey God but it's what we can do I'm going to give God this and I'm going to give God that all I give him I want to give it to him along with obedience to his word because if I don't I will present to him my works and my Disobedience will cancel out everything that I've done sincere that ain't enough Mark chapter 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men can you imagine millions of people going to church every week worshiping God praising have their praise bands have all that sort of thing worship sing cry get emotional sincere as they can be absolutely sincere and lost why they're following the Commandments of men and make that their Doctrine you can show them up the word said my pastor don't believe that now notice back to First Samuel 15 19 wherefore then did a style not obey the voice of the Lord that this fly upon the spoil and deceive on the side of the Lord and Saul Center Samuel yay I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me I'd have brought AJ the king of amalek was that what God Said but watch what he does he merges his will his thought in with the promise of God to make his will and God's will appear to be the same friends this is what gets all of us in trouble to this very day when we will try to reason with this and reason with that and oh well you know I don't know I mean my goodness you know we're living my goodness we're living in 2023 surely God don't expect us to live live this way he does yeah he actually does and God expects preachers to live way too God expects preachers to Obama's matter of fact he expects them more against anybody else but a lot of times preachers are the one that pushes the boundaries so I think it by well oh my goodness priest mother Donny I have brought a game the king of amalek and how utterly destroyed how can you utterly destroy everything when the king is sitting right there well maybe said I felt led well hey you know what I've done been around for a long time now and I've done found out with a lot of folks that right there overrides any Scripture any quote well praise the Lord will you all be praying quick I get off this part of this series won't you notice verse 21 but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the thing I they should have been destroyed okay are you happy now you see can watch his attitude and see he finally just goes ahead and admits a little bit of it but admits it with an attitude Sally continues to lay blame on the people I draw who was this guy King Saul King Saul King Saul and saulkner said wait a minute wait a minute this is not right look look consult the prophet here oh my goodness so Saul added Pride lying passing the blame Rebellion to his stubbornness my goodness I went home Wednesday after last Wednesday service so this on my mind went to baby that on my mind got got up the next morning on Thursday and I started studying just on the word obey went from The Book of Genesis all the way to Revelation then I looked at obeying and obedience every form that I could find obedience obedient every word that I could find in the scripture I was just absolutely overwhelmed to see how much God loves obedience but even though it may be simple to us and sometimes we don't even understand his will about it for us to give him praise and trials when you do it you're obeying and that pleases him when you do it notice Samuel said I said Lord has great Delight remember we read this last Wednesday night pleasure desire longing so God Longs praise the Lord God longs for this type of something from his people half the Lord is great delight and burn offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord so this is why many of these people that we've been reading or not in Corinthians will stand there that day and the worst shall be a total loss so preachers that have preached their dogmas and their Doctrine Every Woman preacher will be a totally lost when she stands there there'll be some of them that will be saved yes so as by fire but they will lose every work they've ever done every missionary that has baptized people in an adultery baptism gonna send the prophet teaches us someone you're baptized in the name of father son holy ghost that is an adultery baptism how can you be bride married to the bridegroom and have an adultery baptism praise the Lord so they'll lose everything it's like they will stand there and assist that they just got saved like the thief on the cross yet they were Theologian they were a preacher they were this side the other and they're standing there expecting all these rewards and they look behind them and there's absolutely nothing oh Jesus don't let that happen to us Lord behold two oh it's better than sacrifice you see this is why brother Branham could say this opening quote that if he would be in the will of God to never speak to one more person and that would be the will of God he'd rather do that than to speak to ten thousand a night out of the will of God why because obedience is better than sacrifice so a person sacrifices their strength and they give up this and they do that and the other but if they're disobeying God as they go along the way what's it going to be attributed to they'll lose the whole thing all being smoke notice behold to obey is better than sacrifice to hearken oh my to hearken to hear be a tenant he pay attention listen so to hearken it's better than the fat of rims now remember who sang this this is Samuel which is a levite and a prophet he knew how important the sacrifices were he knew they were a requirement of God but look what he's bringing right along with that requirement of the sacrifice if you don't have obedience them sacrifices are in vain let me come to verse 23. for Rebellion now what are we talking about rebellion already mentioned Rebellion because this is what Saul did so he rebelled against the teaching of the Prophet the word of God spoken by the prophet and exalted his own opinion above that word well I just don't think that's necessary yeah I just don't feel that we need to do that I just don't think that we are our kids I just don't think they need to get all worked up and get a Pentecostal experience I know you're going to understand but there's a war going on right now and the ranks of the message it's a war on one side that's foreign motion for prayer lines for the supernatural move and then the other side in the message is against prayer lines preaching against them against people falling out against people getting emotional against people worshiping God and trying to find quotes and scriptures to back it up well I'll tell you one thing any preacher comes here and goes to preaching out here I'm going to back him up against the wall and tell him there's more quotes and there's more scriptures uh-huh come on now because you know what that preacher's doing he's doing exactly what Saul did he's taken the quotes he wants all but he won't take them quotes in invisible Union or the prophet of God said they don't want none of them tongues speaking Acts 2 38 young ones around aha they don't want none of them but he says that's the only kind the word can bring forth they don't want that second items children whales acting like they did on the day of Pentecost come on somebody preach with me I'll tell you one thing this Prophet said it is our right in the church age book it is our inalienable right to be exactly the church that was Mark 16. yes I believe in laying hands on the sick yes I still believe in casting out devil and yes I'm still going to have prayer life and yes I'm still going to shout and yes if the Holy Ghost moves on me I'm still going to jump I'm still going to speak in tone I'm going to worship God because it is my right as a child of God it is my right to have Victory it's my right to hide peace and if you don't want it going back to the Church of Christ thank you I know some of them preachers know them quotes because I've sent them to them you think it Alters them absolutely not why they're like so they'll take what they want and they'll say bless God I'm preaching what the prophet said no tell them the truth you're preaching part of what the prophet said how can this Prophet come and preach something different than Jesus preached remember who it was that gave the Commission in Mark 16 it wasn't a man it wasn't a prophet if the Lord Jesus didn't want his children laying hands on one another blame him he's the one who said they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover and once and brother Branham they gave the commission it was not Peter it was not Paul it was the Lord Jesus himself they shall speak with new tongues and somebody said but shall glory to God if they drink any day they say it shall not harm them [Music] brother Donnie we was hoping as you got older that you'd get more wisdom and you'd calm down if I get in a wheelchair I'll be the only preacher in the message with wheels to popping wheelies on my wheelchair shouting under the influence of the Holy Ghost hallelujah oh glory to God I don't care how old your house young you are that ain't got nothing to do with your age it's knowing that you're born again the only thing I can figure is into these message preachers that's against emotion is because they never been born again their self why in the world would any preacher fight the baptism of the Holy Ghost if he's ever had it he'd want everybody to get it it brought his children to get it and what his grandchildren together he'd want everybody in this church to get it thank you well brother Donnie you just say that because you come from Pentecost now I say that because I come from God let me close for Rebellion because that's the sin of witchcraft so in any message preacher refuses quotes scriptures because of his own preconceived idea he might as well draw a pentagram on the floor of his church and cut the throat of a goat and worship the devil because he's worshiping one less than the devil he's worshiping himself well I don't rock this I don't really care what you don't like hey man brother Tony these pictures or disfellowship with you what's new about that Lord have mercy I'm one of the most disfellowship preachers in America you think I'm going to worry about that you think I'm going to set up tonight and lose one week of sleep over a bunch of Baptist preachers sending a message full of pissed when they shouldn't even be there in the first place not born again not filled with the Holy Ghost not got a word verse I don't want third people shot in the victory Of God don't want their people to be healed don't want their people to be delivered not bad ain't got no right being in the Pulpit saying he's preaching the gospel the gospel makes God's children free it breaks the Yoke of sin and breaks the Yoke of unbelief it will make you free indeed make you free Ze you see what Rebellion does it dethrones God it dethrones God and set up who whatever man it is that you're taking over God's word then you're setting him up as your absolute and if it's your mama well you move God out of his throne you got your mama sitting there fit your daddy Uncle so and so on ain't so and so or you're rotten self well I don't believe and I don't think you've got yourself on God's wrong you Dethrone God who are we who are we to Dethrone the Almighty dear friends it's going to be a fearful thing one day I said a lot it's really it's really sad that these folks out here where they're going to stand when it comes to the message and being judged by it you know what's worse people who say they believe it and preachers leading the pack and we'll pick and sort and pick and sort and exalt their opinion above a Vindicated prophet of God I've sent preachers quotes after quotes after quotes through the years I think maybe they're ignorant maybe they don't know no different and you send them page after page after page after page don't even affect them and they'll text you back or email you thanks for the information when you say information oh my goodness Rebellion is that's the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry what's a Hebrew word there for an idolatrous Terror friend so a terraform was an idol made of Clay Wood whatever so you can imagine that the prophet is telling Samuel it's it's equivalent to idolatry oh my goodness so for a man to commit a sin and be proven by the scripture or the message that is wrong and go right on in his obstinacy God have mercy no doubt every one of us here tonight our believing things that's wrong we just don't know it yet but a real son or daughter or God that's filled with the Holy Ghost you show them where they're wrong they'll straighten up I don't understand how people can go for weeks and months and years and years and years and fight the very message they say they believe and think they're going in a rapture God help us God help us God help us God help us that we don't turn into such people by the skin God help us that we will always humble ourselves by the chapel before the word of God and lay our stubbornness and our Rebellion you see why God so hates this it comes from the Devil stubbornness is not from God it's from Satan Rebellion is not from God that's what I'm saying look at it all down through the scripture look on the children of Israel rebelled against Moses look and they rebelled against this leader that leader even though they were the called out people but they rebelled against God's chosen leader and look what God done to him we'll do this and that and the other Moses he don't know what he's doing we'll do this and that you understand what they did trying to split the children of Israel you understand why God looks at that when people rebel against God's chosen leader it is open Rebellion against God himself they looked at both oh he's a man he's just doing this and that other than nothing but a big family deal look at his sister she's in charge of the music department season one does all the shouting all the singing playing the tambourine look at his brother he's the high priest look at his nephew he's the priest it's a whole family deal they look I said there's more here than Moses I'll tell one thing but God said step back and I'll destroy him why they rebelled against God's choice of the leader of that move when message preachers exalt themselves a bunch above God's Prophet they're doing the same thing dathan and Korah did in the wilderness well God sent brother Branham of course as a prophet but God sent brother so and so up here in the Northeast to add clarification to the message to make it more understandable and then God sent another man on down in the Middle East so that he would be the teacher among the message and then God sent another man over here and God sent another man over there so it's Malachi 4 and you Malachi 4 and you Malachi 4 and you said we've got to have malachiophore in you and before long Malachi before disappears and you're the one that appears on the same you're not writing and shining their Shining Armor well I'm fixing to Buck you off this horsepower there ain't no scripture in the word of God that tells us he'll ever be anything greater as a matter of fact God's Prophet said if anything ever Rises greater than this I'm a false prophet so I don't care who says they've got a greater move they're a liar amen I said they are a liar God bless y'all sure love you [Applause] this battle hits Hallelujah oh dear God hide Me Lord hide me hide me from me ah these people are their soul from The Pride Robson and see the arrogance are flesh oh Lord we don't ever want to become a saw we don't ever want to become one that picks and chooses and picks and chooses help us Lord the prophet identified his ministry to us when he said that 1962 that he hoped God and let him take the course of his word and dress his bride in it and he said if he could find a character like Rebecca then if he could get her to stand still long enough to be able to get her dressed in the cloths of the word oh Jesus we don't want to meet you in our filthy rags Lord God that we know that there was given unto us fine women clean and white we believe it comes towards Jesus with what you purchased for us on the cross by your blood and then it comes by the washing of the water of the word of Malachi 4 in the last days so it ain't no wonder then Satan will try to come and add this and take away that well you know we don't know what brother Brandon was in the flesh when he said that or not well we're just we we don't know and you know after all he was just a man and that that might have been some of his old Baptist ways and I could understand some of these denominational people saying that but message people help us Lord help us Lord to stay clean to that evil spirit oh God we love you Lord Jesus we don't want to be stubborn we don't want to be rebellious help us father we want our church to be built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone Lord help us that we can be faithful when you come you're the one who asked the question when the son of man cometh will he find faith on the Earth you didn't ask if you'd find signs or if you'd find miracles or churches or music or emotion but you said when I come well I find faithfulness yes Lord I'll answer your question tonight you will you will because you sent your Prophet to turn the hearts of the children back to the face of the apostolic fathers and when you come there will be a people it's if it's a day from now five years from now 500 years from now there will be a people on the Earth that believe your word praise God it will be that Omega bride oh Jesus we want to be part of it father can we just raise our hands in the presence of the Lord how many once wants God to help you that you'll never get that over rebellious thing on you you'll never exalt what you think or what somebody else thinks about the scripture or above the Vindicated prophet but we just stay with I don't understand it by the time my goodness friends are so little I do understand but I'm going to obey Brothers understand it or not well can you understand it honestly what's hard to understand whenever you say I'm supposed to praise him in trial I'll praise him in trial if he says women don't wear pants and don't wear pants man don't wear your hair like a woman well we don't do it what's complicated to understand about that we just obey what he said and it brings God such pleasure you think he don't look at us and know they're questioning this and they don't understand that and yet we do it because he said do it that gives him double Joy because if you understood it they say okay fine you okay I understand that but there's much about the word we still don't understand and yet we do it with all the sincerity of our hearts because the word tells us to do it my word they cast your name out as evil what did Jesus tell us to do reap for joy leap for joy and be exceeded and good glad for great is your reward in heaven well when they run you down when they do all these things praise the Lord in the middle of Trials praise His name bless him when times is going bad bless him when they're going good just bless him all the time and you said well I don't understand that he didn't ask you to understand just ask you to do it so in the middle of hell you raise your hands and say Lord God I want to thank you for blessing me I want to thank you for saving me I want to thank you thank you thank you he just said boy that's my boy that's my little girl down there look at her she's going through all hell and yes she's blessing my name the devil can't robber of my praise the devil can't rob a very adoration to me and it just brings such Joy To Our Father's Heart not but ever everything is going good but whenever things turned against you and you just love him anyhow I mean it wants to be that kind of Christian just love him with all of your heart and praise him even when you don't feel like praising him how many like to praise him right here now you may not feel like it well maybe you're tired and you work today and you've done this or that you say you know what the Lord told me when I come to the house of God to lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting I'm a little tired my Feet's a little aching my hands are a little achy but I'm going to raise my achy hands I'll tell you what you might raise and make your hands and you might take them down the aches gone the Lord Jesus might heal you well you've got to make your hands stuck up in the air why because you're obeying his word oh ban his word pray for them that despitefully use it well you do it because he said so and when you do it he says I want you to look at my youngin all angels of God I want you to look at them look at them they're praying for their enemies they're turning the other cheek look at them they don't even understand why I said that but they're doing it they're doing it for one reason and one reason only because they know I said it oh praise God praise God you know there's no scripture in the Bible where it ever says that angels and what they do like that brings God such Joy it's your obedience that brings him Joy
