[14:31] Jesus thank you
[14:34] Father praise the
[14:37] Lord I'm sure we can all say that
[14:39] tonight he's been so faithful and so
[14:42] true to each of us greet you tonight in
[14:44] the name of the Lord trust you're doing
[14:47] well happy to be able to be gathered
[14:50] together again
[14:52] tonight amen let's start um with a
[14:56] question shall
[14:58] we I know that God can hear our thoughts
[15:03] but I've been
[15:05] wondering if he hears all of our
[15:09] thoughts and if we are held
[15:12] accountable for any bad
[15:15] thoughts I wonder if is anybody here
[15:17] that's had any bad thoughts this
[15:22] week W so this question apparently
[15:25] applies to all of us don't it well let's
[15:28] read a a couple of scriptures and then
[15:30] we'll we'll pray and then you can be
[15:31] seated Matthew
[15:34] 15:18 but those things which prede out
[15:37] of the mouth come forth from the heart
[15:41] and they defile a man and Jesus is
[15:43] answering what the scribes the Pharisees
[15:46] had ask him about eating contaminated
[15:49] Foods so they had a levitical law they
[15:52] could eat certain types of food certain
[15:54] types they couldn't so they were trying
[15:56] to criticize Jesus and his disciples
[15:59] and he was bringing them a point that
[16:03] it's not so much what went in them as
[16:05] far as food that contaminated them but
[16:07] it's actually what came out and he's
[16:11] showing them the source of where it's
[16:13] coming from in verse 19 he says out of
[16:16] the heart
[16:19] proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries
[16:25] fornications thefts false witness and
[16:30] blasphemies so out of the heart of an
[16:33] unconverted person comes all of these
[16:36] things 2 Corinthians chapter 10:5 but
[16:39] then Paul turns around now as Christians
[16:41] he says casting down imaginations and
[16:44] every High say that exalteth itself
[16:48] against the knowledge of God and
[16:50] bringing into
[16:52] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[16:56] of Christ it's about
[17:00] together Lord Jesus we thank you for
[17:02] this opportunity that we can be gathered
[17:05] together again tonight Lord to be able
[17:07] to try our best to answer questions that
[17:10] are on the hearts of these young people
[17:13] things that are troubling them things
[17:16] that they are concerned about is this
[17:18] right or is this wrong and Lord we saw
[17:21] from the hands that were uplifted by
[17:23] this one question that it affects every
[17:26] one of us so we pray tonight that you
[17:28] would would help us speak through me
[17:30] Lord to be able to help them in this
[17:32] battle that they're in we pray tonight
[17:35] father in Jesus name amen you can be
[17:41] seated once of course that we're born
[17:44] again and we received the Holy Ghost and
[17:47] we are a new creature in Christ Jesus
[17:50] but we know that our mind is not
[17:54] converted your intelligence your brain
[17:57] it's referred to in the the New
[17:59] Testament as well as the old and they
[18:01] would call it the heart we know it's not
[18:04] so much this muscle here that's beating
[18:07] the blood and passing it through our
[18:09] body but it was what they considered to
[18:12] be the soul or that which was tied to
[18:14] the conscience realm of knowing right
[18:17] and wrong and this question let me read
[18:20] it to you again I know that God can hear
[18:22] our thoughts but I've been wondering if
[18:24] he hears all of our thoughts and we are
[18:27] held accountable for for any bad
[18:30] thoughts now most of you raise your hand
[18:32] whenever I ask you how many of you had
[18:34] had bad thoughts this week and you saw
[18:36] most of mind more up so how can that be
[18:40] how can a child of God a Christian that
[18:42] loves the Lord Jesus have thoughts that
[18:46] would be embarrassing I would imagine
[18:48] every one of us if we'd be honest here
[18:50] tonight that we have had thoughts even
[18:54] about God that you wouldn't want nobody
[18:57] to know that you had is there a God how
[19:00] do you knows there a god is he real all
[19:03] that sort of thing anybody brave enough
[19:05] just wiggle your finger okay God bless
[19:07] you sis God bless you all most of you
[19:09] then okay well guess what as your pastor
[19:12] so have I and because of the part inside
[19:17] of us that is not redeemed I love the
[19:20] way that brother brandom when he goes
[19:22] siding with this and he he makes it very
[19:25] clear to us um in the greatest battle
[19:27] ever fall that there there's a mutual
[19:30] ground a No Man's Land he called it and
[19:34] they fight there at this place notice
[19:37] the title of his sermon the greatest
[19:39] battle ever fought so there had to be a
[19:41] place that would be chosen in the
[19:42] beginning to where that this war would
[19:46] transpire between good and evil once it
[19:48] was brought down from the Heavens to the
[19:51] Earth he said they just don't one fight
[19:53] over here and one down here one right
[19:56] over there but there's a battle front
[19:59] where they meet and test their powers
[20:03] now we know that so even in the natural
[20:06] that there has to be a battlefield that
[20:08] is chosen Napoleon met his fate at
[20:11] waterl we know the wars between the
[20:14] North and the South and we could go
[20:15] through different places by which that
[20:18] the north one here and the South one
[20:20] there and World War I World War II so
[20:23] there is a mutual place we know what's
[20:25] going on now between Israel and and uh
[20:28] Hamas and it's going on between Russia
[20:31] and Ukraine so there is a place that is
[20:34] chosen and it's not really a
[20:36] Battleground if there's only one side
[20:39] that is there so there must be a mutual
[20:42] place that is chosen and both sides in
[20:46] this case God and the devil God and the
[20:50] devil agree on this Mutual place by
[20:54] which the war for man's soul will rage
[20:58] and that place is your mind now when
[21:02] we're lost of course Satan has our soul
[21:05] then our soul our spirit and our body is
[21:08] in complete harmony with what he wants
[21:10] us to do then after we're born again
[21:13] you're talking about a mess we become a
[21:16] real mess because our soul is born from
[21:21] Heaven actually when Jesus said that to
[21:23] Nicodemus and he said you must be born
[21:26] again and the Greek words actually or
[21:29] you must be born from above now before
[21:32] that happened to you your soul was lost
[21:35] your spirit was lost your body was lost
[21:36] your soul was in darkness your spirit
[21:38] was in darkness your body was in
[21:40] darkness so at least you had a Harmony
[21:43] even though it was a warped Harmony but
[21:45] we did have Harmony was all lost all
[21:48] three of us Soul spirit and body then
[21:51] when God transforms us and performs this
[21:53] miracle inside of us then this war
[21:57] really starts because there's a part of
[22:00] us that is of heaven born from Heaven A
[22:04] Heavenly origin Heavenly attributes but
[22:07] then it leaves the spirit which is still
[22:11] unregenerated leaves the flesh which is
[22:14] still unregenerated and as Paul would
[22:16] refer to it the carnal mind so where
[22:20] then is God going to choose the battle
[22:23] it's his call not the devil's it's God's
[22:26] call so God shows the mind before Man
[22:30] actually ever even fail in the Garden of
[22:33] Eden now notice he says there's a
[22:35] Battlefront where they meet and test
[22:38] their powers now if we would be able to
[22:41] go and I've been to different
[22:43] battlefields been in Europe and
[22:45] different parts of the world and Africa
[22:47] and the United States and and see some
[22:50] of the different battlefields maybe many
[22:52] of you traveled and then have to do
[22:57] likewise and in those places there would
[23:00] be such bombardments of cannons and
[23:02] there would be such destruction and such
[23:06] Devastation for those of you that have
[23:08] went to the Civil War battlefields and
[23:10] you've seen antium and Gettysburg and
[23:12] you've been um to Mississippi and you've
[23:14] seen the encampments there before you
[23:16] cross the Mississippi River going into
[23:18] Louisiana and you see and oh now it's
[23:21] beautiful you see you know you see
[23:23] certain monuments that are erected there
[23:24] you come into Chattanooga and you see
[23:27] where the first core of Georgia was at
[23:29] and you can see where the second Gore of
[23:31] Illinois was at and you can see all that
[23:34] but you don't see what it was R like in
[23:37] that day you don't see all the holes
[23:39] that were in the ground the pit the pit
[23:42] bits and pieces of broken bones of
[23:45] humans bodies that was laying everywhere
[23:47] arms and and legs and and the upper
[23:50] torso of body and the bottom part of the
[23:52] body was blown away and blood and it it
[23:56] would be sickening for us to be able to
[23:58] look look at it that's the real
[24:00] Battleground but when man gets done with
[24:03] it man goes over it he manicures it sews
[24:06] it down in beautiful grass and he
[24:08] decorates it and he puts concrete
[24:10] statues or granite or marble or whatever
[24:13] they are and then man turns it into a
[24:16] mum or he turns it into a memorial but
[24:19] that's not really what the battlefield
[24:21] look like if we could go back to those
[24:24] battlefields and we would hear in the
[24:26] dead of the night men screaming somebody
[24:30] help me please help me a leg blowed off
[24:34] blood pouring out of their body maybe
[24:37] shot on the side of their head with an
[24:39] ear missing and it would have been
[24:41] horrific it's terrible for me to even
[24:43] describe it to you and the reason I do
[24:45] that is so you'll be able to catch the
[24:47] impact of what your mind is now take
[24:50] from that from a natural setting of a
[24:52] battlefield and think that that's what
[24:55] our minds are today as a children of God
[24:58] so both both God and Satan test their
[25:04] powers in this battlefield so how would
[25:07] it be in a war so Napoleon would shoot
[25:10] their cannons and the other side would
[25:12] shoot theirs and the Civil War the north
[25:14] would shoot and the South would shoot in
[25:16] Russia they're doing it um today in the
[25:19] modern day battlefield of course totally
[25:21] different but it's still they're testing
[25:23] their powers so their powers will be
[25:25] artillery their powers will be today Air
[25:28] Force if they has it they if they will
[25:31] be the Armored Division if they have
[25:33] that they will be their security it will
[25:35] be their spies so in in the battlefield
[25:39] is where all of this comes together and
[25:42] if you and I can just imagine tonight
[25:44] this very day just this being Thursday
[25:47] in the M the last night being the middle
[25:49] of the week untelling all the thoughts
[25:51] that have went through your mind already
[25:53] and the battle that is raged and War in
[25:56] your mind and it doesn't stop you come
[25:58] to church cuz many times when we come to
[26:00] the house of God and the presence of the
[26:02] Lord is there to help us and Deliver us
[26:04] that's when sometimes people's minds
[26:06] really go into a rage because Satan
[26:09] don't want to get anything out of the
[26:11] service you better believe he knows what
[26:13] I study he knows what the men of God
[26:16] study he he ain't no dummy he can read
[26:18] what I've got there he said oh no I
[26:20] don't want them to get help that'll help
[26:22] this young lady and that'll help this
[26:23] young man and that boy and that preacher
[26:26] and oh goodness I've got to do whatever
[26:27] I've got to do to to work on them so you
[26:30] come in and you sit down and isn't it
[26:33] amazing that the battle will pick up
[26:35] you're standing that they talking to one
[26:37] another smiling enjoying one another's
[26:39] fellowship and you come in you to sit
[26:41] down oh my goodness did I unplug my
[26:42] curling arm of course I'm speaking to
[26:44] Sisters hopefully tonight and not
[26:46] Brothers you know did I do this oh no
[26:48] did I do that you think where in the
[26:50] world is that coming from it's your
[26:52] enemy your enemy is shooting his ammo
[26:57] into your mind to to try to get
[26:58] something in your mind maybe you run
[27:00] into somebody out there and you didn't
[27:02] think they were friendly to you and they
[27:05] wasn't very nice let me give you an
[27:06] example I saw one of the brothers from
[27:08] our church here a couple of days ago
[27:10] over at the fellowship H and he come up
[27:13] and he was telling me a few things was
[27:15] just talking a little bit and
[27:16] fellowshipping and he said something to
[27:18] me and he meant it as as a compliment
[27:21] and I took it as a compliment but it has
[27:24] worried him to death he's not slept for
[27:27] the last four nights
[27:29] so he called me today and he wanted to
[27:31] apologize to me because it it has
[27:34] worried him to death he has Fred and
[27:37] he's been so concerned about he's
[27:39] probably listening to me right now and I
[27:41] told him I said brother don't worry
[27:42] about that I never even took it that way
[27:45] I never even thought that he said
[27:46] brother Donnie in service last night I
[27:49] couldn't even look at you while you were
[27:51] preaching cuz I thought you must think
[27:53] I'm awful now you know who was doing
[27:56] that don't you who the devil so the
[27:59] devil was firing his ammo into this
[28:03] brother and has been doing it for
[28:04] several days I said what I hate about
[28:06] the whole thing is that you waited this
[28:08] long before you just was able to talk to
[28:11] him and make it right now the devil
[28:13] won't just make us think bad thoughts
[28:15] about God he'll try to make us think bad
[28:17] thoughts about one another he'll try to
[28:19] make us think bad thoughts about the
[28:21] ministry if they're preaching and you
[28:23] know and this thing uhoh somebody's been
[28:25] talking to him somebody has told him I
[28:28] know there's no way he knew that I got
[28:31] an email from one of the sisters of our
[28:33] church week before last and she said
[28:35] brother Donnie a sister and I at the
[28:37] church was wondering if you have the
[28:39] church
[28:41] bugged because a sister and I was
[28:43] talking just a week or so ago and some
[28:46] of the very things that we were talking
[28:48] about you got up and preached about of
[28:51] course she meant it as a joke and I
[28:53] answered and said no I don't have the
[28:55] church bugged but God does so God knows
[28:59] exactly how to speak to us so however
[29:01] Satan can bombard our minds thoughts
[29:05] about one another thoughts about God
[29:07] thoughts about ourself that we think
[29:09] about oursel and we criticize oursel I
[29:12] don't know about you my greatest enemy
[29:14] is me my greatest enemy of all people is
[29:18] myself now I want you to notice how
[29:20] brother randam lays this out he said
[29:22] where each Army tests its strengths
[29:25] against the other Army I don't miss this
[29:28] when the great battle started on the
[29:30] earth there had to be a mutual place
[29:33] there had to be a place selected for the
[29:35] battle to begin for the battle to rage
[29:39] and that Battlegrounds began in the
[29:43] human mind so it actually rages in our
[29:47] mind so it's not just like a little you
[29:49] know passive casual well how you doing
[29:51] today God and God answers the devil back
[29:53] well I'm doing pretty good how are you
[29:55] doing and then the devil says well I've
[29:57] been kind of busy today and you know I
[29:59] just been going around and God said well
[30:01] yeah me too I just been kind of hanging
[30:03] out you know trying to save the lost and
[30:05] trying to F with the Holy Ghost and so
[30:07] what you got planned tomorrow well I'm
[30:09] doing the same old thing what are you
[30:10] doing god well I plan on doing the same
[30:12] old thing too they're firing they're
[30:15] bombing they've got their smart bombs
[30:17] they've got their grenades and they're
[30:19] blowing up dirt and they're blowing up
[30:22] holes but guess where those holes are in
[30:26] your poor little mind
[30:30] it ain't no wonder sometimes we feel
[30:32] like our mind is about to explode
[30:35] anybody ever feel that way besides me
[30:37] and you feel like as the Bible says that
[30:40] yet you're at your wit's end it seems
[30:44] like there' be no peace now remember
[30:46] we're not the only one as Christians
[30:48] that go through this the people out here
[30:49] on the world you can hear them go
[30:51] through the drive-thru they'll tell you
[30:53] what a tri trial they have just the
[30:56] people you work with that don't even
[30:58] serve God because it's an onslaught of
[31:01] the last days and they don't even
[31:03] understand the degree that you go
[31:05] through because yours theirs is being
[31:08] bombarded just with the things of
[31:10] everyday life but God and the devil is
[31:14] bombarding you now think of it almighty
[31:17] God with all of his power but he cannot
[31:20] allow Satan to just put his thoughts
[31:23] there and then him not come back watch
[31:26] he said where the battle starts Hearts
[31:28] the human mind was chosen for the place
[31:29] of the battle where it was to begin that
[31:32] is because decisions are made from the
[31:37] mind I skipped on down a little bit in
[31:39] this paragraph and he says the
[31:40] Battlegrounds where you've got to meet
[31:43] your enemy is in the mind you've got to
[31:47] make your
[31:49] choice it meets you decisions are made
[31:53] in the mind the head that's where Satan
[31:55] meets you and decisions are because that
[31:58] God made a man that way so and in that
[32:03] in mind you can imagine every day of our
[32:07] life we're going to be bombarded with
[32:09] right with wrong there was a certain man
[32:13] that was one of brother randoms
[32:14] Associates and he made a a personal
[32:17] testimony he left it behind so we' be
[32:18] able to listen to it and he went to
[32:21] Brother random after one of the services
[32:23] and he was actually standing in the
[32:24] prayer line and people would come and if
[32:27] they had a prayer card and they would
[32:28] take the prayer card and they would lead
[32:30] them up for brother brandham to pray for
[32:31] them and this brother came to brother
[32:33] brandham after service and he said
[32:35] brother brandham I am so ashamed I have
[32:38] to apologize and I have to ask you to
[32:41] forgive me for something he said brother
[32:43] what what was it and he said brother
[32:45] random when I was standing there in the
[32:46] prayer line up front tonight Leading the
[32:49] People the saints of God to you these
[32:52] horrible filthy thoughts were coming
[32:56] through my mind
[32:59] his answer always surprises me every
[33:01] time I quote it brother Bram said
[33:04] brother those thoughts were being aimed
[33:08] at me not you but you were in the way
[33:14] and they were hitting you and can you
[33:15] imagine a prophet standing there filled
[33:18] with the Holy Ghost Discerning telling
[33:20] people their names where they live their
[33:23] addresses you went to a doctor today
[33:25] heavy set man got glasses on he told you
[33:28] so and so and so can you imagine that's
[33:30] going on and the devil is still
[33:32] attacking his mind at the same time it
[33:35] may be strange and peculiar for you but
[33:37] the devil does a
[33:39] preacher the same way one that's not
[33:41] even gifted like brother Brandon I'll be
[33:43] up here preaching 90 miles an hour and
[33:45] you're thinking how can that man talk
[33:47] that fast but while I'm talking that
[33:49] fast the devil is looking for an
[33:51] opportunity to tell me they don't like
[33:53] what you're saying that person got up
[33:56] and walked out you made them
[33:59] mad it's amazing how he will fight you
[34:02] and then you're standing there oh no did
[34:04] I make them mad oh no did I say that and
[34:07] I'm talking 90 miles an hour when that's
[34:09] going on you say how in the world can
[34:11] that be I don't know how it is exactly
[34:13] but all I know is a gift in you it's
[34:15] different from you the anointing anoints
[34:17] the gift but the battle is still going
[34:19] on in your mind a Catholic priest said
[34:21] in one of brother bam services and he
[34:23] said he was sitting there writing stuff
[34:25] writing stuff and he said I thought that
[34:28] man is disagreeing with everything I'm
[34:31] saying but at the end of the service
[34:34] that man got up behind the pullit and
[34:36] said after this sermon we've got to get
[34:39] out of the mess the church has got to
[34:40] get out of the mess it's in or we got to
[34:42] get out of the mess the church is in so
[34:44] brother brandham thought humanly this
[34:47] man was disagreeing with everything that
[34:49] he said but actually that man got up and
[34:51] said basically an amen to what he said
[34:54] why is it doing it for to get that
[34:56] preacher off
[34:58] and if Satan can get that preacher think
[35:00] this one don't like it oh notice him
[35:03] he's asleep well maybe didn't sleep on
[35:05] all night last night he gets in church
[35:06] he gets comfortable he dozes off but
[35:09] here I am y'all are sitting there
[35:11] looking up this way but I'm standing up
[35:13] here looking back at all of you so this
[35:16] person gets up and goes out that one
[35:18] gets up and goes out some will set there
[35:21] in right and the devil will say look at
[35:23] them they're writing they're writing
[35:25] down things you've misquoted
[35:28] is that true most of the time it ain't
[35:30] it's good points to you it's things that
[35:33] you say oh I don't want to forget that
[35:35] don't you see he lies to me just like he
[35:38] lies to you so what if I get to thinking
[35:40] about that oh okay all right sis you
[35:43] quit writing now I I know you're writing
[35:45] something you're not writing something
[35:47] good and I could get under the influence
[35:49] of what a lie I know Sister Chloe better
[35:53] than that so what is it oh you mean he
[35:55] lies to you brother D just like like he
[35:58] does to you so what do I have to do I in
[36:02] my mind I know I'm talking 90 M an hour
[36:05] but I have to say it within me you're a
[36:07] liar shut your mouth I'm going to preach
[36:09] what God wants me to preach and yet that
[36:12] battle going on in my mind does it
[36:14] happen that way similar to you all when
[36:16] you're in the house of God sure it does
[36:18] now watch he says decisions being made
[36:20] in the mind then Satan will attack it
[36:23] and God will attack so Satan will hit
[36:26] you with things and then God will come
[36:28] back and say but don't the word say this
[36:31] didn't you just hear it last week in the
[36:34] preaching of the word this this and this
[36:36] oh yeah I heard that but I don't know if
[36:38] it was for me for not you know what you
[36:40] have to do what I have to do we have
[36:43] have to take sides when the Lord fires
[36:47] ammo we pick up that ammo and use it
[36:51] against the devil instead of us saying
[36:53] well I'm not sure if it's for me or not
[36:55] you understand what we do then we
[36:58] actually join sides in our mind and our
[37:00] thought patterns with the Enemy every
[37:03] one of us whether or not we realize it
[37:06] we are still human unregenerate as far
[37:09] as in our mind we have the capability of
[37:13] having Divine thoughts and horrible
[37:17] thoughts how many of yall has ever had
[37:19] bad dreams whether it was you know just
[37:22] ungodly dreams or fearful dreams or
[37:24] whatever it is and wake up I used to
[37:28] have a dream I haven't had it in no time
[37:29] tonight I'll probably have it again
[37:31] knowing me but it's it's the same dream
[37:34] I've had it for years and years and
[37:36] years and in the dream I will be sitting
[37:40] smoking a cigarette I've never smoked in
[37:42] my
[37:44] life and in the dream somebody comes up
[37:47] and says brother Donnie I can't believe
[37:49] you're
[37:50] smoking and I will always wake up out of
[37:53] that dream in a cold sweat Shake like a
[38:02] leaf so you can stand and tell your
[38:04] dream now you can tell yours so brother
[38:08] Donnie is that a hidden desire in your
[38:11] heart not
[38:13] hardly but don't you understand Satan
[38:16] has
[38:18] access to our
[38:20] dreams some of these things can actually
[38:22] be caused by medication I received a
[38:25] prayer request last night from a gr
[38:27] great servant of God wanting me to
[38:29] remember him because he's having
[38:31] nightmares because of things that he's
[38:33] going through like your mind your
[38:37] subconscious is also accessible so Satan
[38:41] will try to put it there in your mind
[38:43] why a dream like that can torment you to
[38:47] death and then you're scared to death
[38:49] you wake up thinking oh no oh no do I
[38:52] really want this and when you ask that
[38:54] question the devil's voice will say yeah
[38:57] you do you see you really want to do
[39:01] that what's he doing trying to attack
[39:04] the battlefield when you're trying to
[39:07] rest and God knows we all need rest
[39:09] don't
[39:10] we I like the way brother R deals with
[39:12] this in in Chicago in
[39:15] 1955 he
[39:17] says now it's a strange thing and so
[39:19] much thought of among people and they
[39:21] say well I'm weak and my faith is not
[39:25] very much I'm not a good
[39:29] Christian that's just what the devil
[39:33] wants you to
[39:34] say you're just
[39:37] talking his
[39:39] language so you mean the devil's
[39:42] language is not always curse
[39:46] words the devil's language is not always
[39:50] denominational theology or a catechism
[39:53] or a Creed which which oh I'm not saying
[39:55] that Creed I'm I'm not saying that
[39:57] well when we say this we're talking the
[40:00] devil's language so H H how does that
[40:03] come into us then again he will fire
[40:07] these smart bombs now we know in the day
[40:11] we're living there's two main categories
[40:14] of bombs I'm talking about natural ones
[40:17] one is called a dumb bomb y'all heard of
[40:20] them a dumb bomb okay it's not driven by
[40:25] GPS it's not precise
[40:28] markings then there's the smart bombs
[40:31] which are driven by laser or by GPS they
[40:35] have got them now to where they can
[40:37] actually so this bomb is going subsonic
[40:41] going less than the speed of of sound
[40:44] and if the target moves they can
[40:47] actually redirect that bomb midf flight
[40:51] and put that bomb down the hole of a
[40:55] tank or a man can crawl in and out of
[40:58] that hole about that Bigg
[41:00] round that's the smart bomb the dumb
[41:04] bomb they can be able to name it in a
[41:06] proximity it might be a quarter mile off
[41:08] this way quarter of a mile off that
[41:11] way so does God all of God's bombs are
[41:16] smart bombs he has precise things for
[41:19] what we need but the devil he uses a lot
[41:22] of them dumb bombs so he just fires them
[41:25] over here and fires them over there and
[41:26] fires them over here but remember them
[41:29] dumb bombs have a purpose because
[41:30] they're much cheaper to make some of
[41:33] those others can cost a half a million
[41:35] dollar a
[41:36] piece and the dumb bombs they might be
[41:39] 30
[41:40] 40,000 so there's still a tactical use
[41:44] for dumb bombs because they just fire
[41:47] them one after another after another
[41:49] after another and it's shock and all so
[41:52] it terrifies those on the receiving end
[41:56] where one smart heart bomb can be able
[41:58] to take out a tank a radar you know or
[42:01] whatever but sometimes they want these
[42:03] cheaper ones and they want them to go
[42:05] everywhere you see the devil likes these
[42:08] cheaper dumb
[42:10] bombs because he likes to drop them all
[42:12] around you every day of your life all
[42:15] kinds of thoughts they don't have to be
[42:17] precise you understand most of the
[42:19] things he tells us is absolute lies or
[42:23] contorted Twisted half truths what is it
[42:28] a dumb bomb and I guess I wonder
[42:31] sometimes who's the dumb or the bomb or
[42:34] me I'm going to go ahead and say it you
[42:38] are the bomb isn't it amazing why would
[42:41] we even believe anything he says I mean
[42:46] we're talking about the person the being
[42:49] that is called the father of
[42:55] Lies why do we even pay any attention to
[42:58] him why if he says that you're not a
[43:02] Christian you ought to shout hallelujah
[43:05] that's probably the best sign you
[43:08] are but yet he will keep firing and
[43:12] firing and firing and before
[43:16] long this will happen to us when people
[43:19] will say well I'm weak my faith is not
[43:22] very much I'm not a very good Christian
[43:25] that's just what the devil wants you to
[43:27] to say you're just talking his language
[43:29] right then you
[43:31] mustn't never now I know brother RM said
[43:35] a d double negative in that sentence but
[43:37] I'm not too concerned about Linguistics
[43:39] I'm more concerned about truth aren't
[43:41] you mustn't never say that don't never
[43:46] let your testimony be negative let it be
[43:50] positive all the time so that covers
[43:53] when you feel it and when you don't amen
[43:56] but but remember these bombs they won't
[43:59] all be great gigantic Earth shaking
[44:02] things but sometimes it'll be uavs you
[44:06] know what that is uavs
[44:08] unmanned
[44:10] Vehicles this is what makes it so
[44:12] dangerous in the age we're living
[44:15] drones
[44:16] drones as a matter of fact Lebanon sent
[44:19] one over across the Israeli border last
[44:22] night made it all the way in to an IDF
[44:26] Israel def Force into one of their
[44:29] greatest places where they keep their
[44:33] f-35s you know why they do that because
[44:36] they fly under
[44:38] radar and they fly so low unmanned
[44:42] nobody in them a person in Lebanon
[44:45] sitting there with goggles on and he's
[44:47] driving it so quiet you can barely hear
[44:50] them whisper and fly under the radar and
[44:53] they come right in and then they drop a
[44:56] bomb or they do whatever do damage and
[44:59] yet this is the age that we're living
[45:01] now look we know the natural also
[45:03] reflects the spiritual and this is where
[45:05] we are spiritually the devil's done
[45:07] figured out these uavs so sometimes
[45:10] he'll send a great big old thousand
[45:12] pound bomb my goodness it devastates
[45:15] your world other times he'll send in a
[45:17] little
[45:20] drone and he'll drop it on you and you
[45:22] say where did that come from I I had my
[45:26] radar up here of course if we've got a
[45:29] radar aimed way up here and we're not
[45:32] even looking down here look how a tiny
[45:35] drone you understand they've got drones
[45:38] that are not but 6 in by 6 in by n and
[45:43] can actually carry explosives on them
[45:47] robots Israel has developed robots and
[45:51] they have an army of them and they're
[45:54] dogs they look like dogs
[45:57] they're on their all fours they have
[45:59] machine guns on top coming out of their
[46:02] forehead it's unbelievable the Warfare
[46:05] so think of it when you think of what
[46:06] they've done in the natural how Satan he
[46:09] must do it because this message exposes
[46:13] him like he ain't never been exposed
[46:16] before I'm grateful for it don't you but
[46:19] you see what he does then he must update
[46:22] he must update if he don't if he doesn't
[46:25] do it well there's no way he there even
[46:27] be any competition in this war so once
[46:30] he sees what we've got and the Armament
[46:32] that God has given us then he has to
[46:34] come back say okay what can I do I've
[46:36] got to change this I've got to do this
[46:38] so what does he always revert back to
[46:41] it's always the mind but it's the way he
[46:44] approaches the mind so now watch a child
[46:47] of God loves the Lord oh my they don't
[46:49] curse that they're so watchful of their
[46:52] mouths but they say I'm not a very good
[46:55] Christian I don't have very much
[46:58] faith I I I don't know why I should even
[47:00] go to church that's one of the worst
[47:03] things you can do I
[47:05] know sometimes preachers may say things
[47:08] that make you think a little bit but
[47:10] there are certain things things that I
[47:12] pray I will not pray it out
[47:18] loud I will not pray it out
[47:23] loud he said brother Donnie really yeah
[47:26] question answer 64 brother brandom you
[47:28] told us why you went out west the first
[47:30] time you haven't told us why you went
[47:32] out the second time well he said it's
[47:35] something that the Lord is dealing with
[47:37] me and he said if I keep it in my heart
[47:42] Satan don't know what it is but if I
[47:45] speak it then he will hear it and try to
[47:49] stop it you realize he does not
[47:52] understand and know sometimes how
[47:55] effective the weapons he's using against
[47:57] us really are until he hears us telling
[48:03] our best friend I've been going through
[48:05] this oh it's killing me I'll tell you
[48:07] what it is weing me out oh my I tell you
[48:11] what and Satan says thank
[48:13] you thank you I didn't know if it was
[48:17] working or not I wasn't really sure well
[48:21] thank you for letting me know I I'm a
[48:23] better devil than I thought I was I am
[48:25] so effective against you you understand
[48:28] how we should watch what we say and even
[48:32] watch what we pray this is one of the
[48:35] reasons that Paul mentions in the Book
[48:36] of Romans that whenever we go to pray
[48:39] that we pray in the spirit and he said
[48:41] that we even
[48:43] Gran in the spirit and the spirit of God
[48:45] is groaning but it's a language that the
[48:49] spirit of God knows that we don't know
[48:53] remember brother brand being in the
[48:54] hotel room and he got down to pray and
[48:56] he was praying before the service and it
[48:58] sounded like someone was speaking
[49:01] German and he could hear it he said he
[49:03] thought M that person why he said
[49:05] they're speaking so fast and he said I
[49:08] never heard such and they was going on
[49:10] and on and he finally realized it was
[49:13] him so he come to himself Billy knocks
[49:16] on the door and he said he felt like he
[49:18] could leap through a troop and jump over
[49:20] a wall and he said thought oh my what
[49:23] was that there's something about that
[49:24] anointing when it comes that way come to
[49:26] find out they got to the service that
[49:28] night there was a man couple of men that
[49:30] was bringing a woman and there was in
[49:32] the back of a 1935 chiv they took the
[49:34] back seat out the woman was hemorrhaging
[49:37] pulled over on the side of the road and
[49:38] they thought she was dying it was the
[49:41] very moment that brother brand was
[49:43] praying and he said that angel of the
[49:45] Lord needed an urgent an urgent thing
[49:48] isin't it amazing that an angel of God
[49:51] could not do that the angel could come
[49:55] into the hotel room where he was and
[49:58] anoint him to speak in a language that
[50:01] he had never even learned before but the
[50:03] angel couldn't go directly before father
[50:06] father father look This Woman's about to
[50:08] die if you don't do something
[50:11] quickly why why couldn't that angel do
[50:13] that because you and I are his
[50:17] hands his
[50:19] feet his
[50:21] eyes his
[50:24] mouth praise the Lord
[50:29] so you realize the spirit of God can
[50:32] pray out of us I've done many times in
[50:35] the presence of God when I did not know
[50:38] how to pray for people and I just stay
[50:42] there and be there in his
[50:45] presence and feel something start moving
[50:48] from down within my being as it happened
[50:51] to me last
[50:55] night and something something starts
[50:57] uttering out of you in a language that
[51:00] you have no clue yet I've heard some of
[51:03] the languages that I've spoken around
[51:05] the world before been in an airport he
[51:07] said oh my goodness I've heard that I've
[51:10] heard that I've actually spoken that
[51:12] before where did it come from the spirit
[51:16] of God
[51:17] why that person has a need I don't know
[51:21] it maybe the individual don't even know
[51:23] it but the spirit of God knows it and
[51:27] the spirit of God will take you not just
[51:29] me but you any person that could submit
[51:31] to it if he desires to use you in that
[51:34] way and then Satan looks at that he says
[51:38] wow that's great that's tremendous so if
[51:42] God can do that and God can use
[51:46] them then I reckon I'll try the same
[51:49] thing so what I'm going to do I'm going
[51:52] to just I'm going to torment them I'm
[51:54] going to aggravate them I'm going to
[51:56] cause bad things to happen to them and
[51:57] I'm going to get them discouraged and
[51:59] then I'm going to get them to start
[52:01] saying what I want them to
[52:04] say and I want them to say I'm not a
[52:07] good
[52:08] Christian I I don't I don't have very
[52:10] much
[52:11] Faith he don't he don't love me I'm I'm
[52:15] nothing but a
[52:17] failure you understand what you're doing
[52:19] you understand what what I'm doing and I
[52:20] do that I'm
[52:24] creating I'm creating because I'm a son
[52:28] you're a son or a daughter of God Satan
[52:31] can take them words and cannot create
[52:34] anything because he's not a Creator but
[52:38] I am and you
[52:40] are so if he can put his words in our
[52:43] minds and get us to saying it I I'm no
[52:46] good I'll never amount to nothing I I
[52:49] don't know why the Lord even loves me I
[52:51] ain't got much faith I God I must not be
[52:54] one of God's favorite kids you know what
[52:57] you're doing you're creating this
[53:00] negativity Into Your
[53:02] Atmosphere you are responsible for the
[53:05] atmosphere that you live in and where
[53:07] does it come
[53:09] from the
[53:11] Battleground so Satan hits you and he
[53:14] hits you and he hits you and then God
[53:16] will hit you and you got big explosions
[53:19] over here and then you got big
[53:20] explosions over there no wonder we get
[53:22] so confused at
[53:24] times oh don't you think the Lord for
[53:26] his word
[53:27] though now
[53:29] watch let your testimony always and your
[53:33] thoughts never permit a negative thought
[53:35] to come in your mind if you can help it
[53:40] when it starts that don't entertain it
[53:43] now watch how he separates it if you can
[53:46] stop it from coming into your mind then
[53:48] stop it before it does but sometimes
[53:51] it's like it just po there it is but if
[53:55] it does come into your mind mind don't
[53:58] entertain it I wonder how many of us
[54:00] would be honest tonight and say well
[54:02] that's why I've messed up sometimes cuz
[54:04] I've entertained the thought of the
[54:05] devil you know and yeah he told me I
[54:08] wasn't saved and told me I wasn't this
[54:10] and I got to thinking about that he went
[54:12] to tell me about this brother didn't
[54:14] like me and the next thing I knew I was
[54:16] shunning that brother or that sister and
[54:19] you know they didn't look at me right
[54:20] whenever I come into church the other
[54:22] night and then we entertain that thought
[54:25] now he said never permit a dager thought
[54:27] to come into your mind if you can help
[54:28] it when it starts that don't entertain
[54:30] it well you say I can't help the
[54:32] thoughts from coming well then be like
[54:35] the farmer that said he couldn't stop
[54:37] the birds from flying over his place but
[54:41] he could stop them from
[54:43] roosting so there's a good thing you see
[54:46] you can help the thoughts when they
[54:50] come but
[54:52] don't entertain them just pass it on now
[54:56] watch he's going to tell us how to do it
[54:59] now these are our smart bombs that are
[55:02] aimed back at the Enemy No
[55:06] Sir Jesus Christ is my savior so the
[55:11] devil raised up his head now what you're
[55:14] going to do you're going to zero right
[55:16] in on him and you're going
[55:19] to with what your feelings your opinion
[55:23] your idea no we're told what to to use
[55:26] against him don't use your feelings
[55:28] because he'll pick on you when you ain't
[55:30] feeling God that day and he'll whip you
[55:32] but the word is always the same whether
[55:34] you feed it or not now load yourself up
[55:37] now with these things Jesus Christ is my
[55:41] savior All Things Are Mine by God and
[55:47] I'm going to keep them now how is it by
[55:49] the grace of God this is the only way
[55:51] not your goodness not my goodness by the
[55:53] grace of God I'm going to keep and I'm
[55:57] going to
[55:58] testify of them God can only bless you
[56:03] as you confess that he's done it for you
[56:05] see he's the high priest of our
[56:08] confession is that right Hebrews 3 he
[56:10] said that he's the high priest of our
[56:12] confession he can only do for us here's
[56:15] our a b
[56:18] c's he can only do for us as we accept
[56:24] a and believe B and confess c a b c
[56:34] except believe confess a't that awesome
[56:39] praise the Lord accept believe confess
[56:44] don't think sitting there in a
[56:46] wheelchair now you imagine he's talking
[56:47] to an individual that's sitting there in
[56:49] the
[56:49] surface don't think sitting there in the
[56:52] wheelchair that you're hopeless and
[56:55] helpless you're not don't let that
[56:58] negative thought ever pass through don't
[57:01] let it anchor you can't help it from
[57:06] going through your mind so negative
[57:10] thoughts that Satan puts in your mind
[57:11] about God or your pastor or your mama
[57:14] your daddy your husband your wife your
[57:16] boyfriend your girlfriend about yourself
[57:18] your walk with God you can't stop all of
[57:21] those from going through Satan knows he
[57:24] has a right hey this is my right fight
[57:26] he could say me and God fight here right
[57:30] there wouldn't it be so much easier if
[57:33] it was just in this church
[57:34] building right here was a Battleground
[57:36] we come in here tonight big holes blowed
[57:39] in the concrete holes blowed in the wall
[57:41] and said well we have to get the
[57:43] construction crew to come back and fix
[57:45] all these holes before Saturday night
[57:47] and Sunday morning my goodness what a
[57:49] mess but how much different it is when
[57:52] those holes are here that confusion is
[57:57] here and you get to where you say you
[58:00] don't know what to believe you don't
[58:01] know what to think oh thank God for his
[58:04] Mercy to us all we'd be a mess wouldn't
[58:06] we if it wasn't for the grace of God
[58:08] don't let it anchor you can't help it
[58:10] from going through your mind that's
[58:11] right but don't let us stop like the old
[58:13] farmer said I can't keep the birds from
[58:15] flying over my place but he had a double
[58:18] barrel
[58:19] shotgun and he said I sure can keep them
[58:21] from roosting so you do the same thing
[58:24] don't let them Roost don't let them let
[58:27] them pass right through here's the
[58:29] shotgun to use both New and Old
[58:32] Testament double barrel very good too
[58:36] now what's this one this is one thing I
[58:38] love about question answers even that
[58:40] the prophet did it 1964 brother brandom
[58:43] please explain how a person knows if
[58:47] he's thinking his own
[58:50] thoughts or if the devil is placing
[58:54] thoughts in his mind this is an
[58:58] excellent question listen carefully how
[59:00] they wrote it now to make him think
[59:04] wrong
[59:05] especially if you
[59:08] know you don't want to think them they
[59:11] answered their own
[59:13] question they answered their own
[59:15] question because they knew brother Joe
[59:18] they were speaking their heart they were
[59:21] speaking the heart of a real believer
[59:23] yeah no doubt this believer was
[59:25] tormented by this and they spoke their
[59:27] own answer I am glad however the brother
[59:30] Ram answered it especially when you know
[59:33] you don't want to think them what he
[59:37] says if it's contrary to the
[59:40] word well this is really hard to
[59:43] understand ain't this answer so
[59:45] complicated I mean it's so difficult to
[59:49] right it's so difficult the only
[59:52] difficult part about it is we make it
[59:55] difficult
[59:57] he's answering this question in the way
[1:00:00] it was
[1:00:01] asked so it was asked from the heart of
[1:00:04] an individual that does not want bad
[1:00:08] thoughts from a heart of an individual
[1:00:10] that that's troubled because these
[1:00:13] thoughts are there so notice how he
[1:00:15] answers it if it's contrary to the word
[1:00:19] it's the devil's thinking so the
[1:00:22] devil can use my mind
[1:00:27] to think his
[1:00:31] thoughts how can that be remember God
[1:00:35] has access to our
[1:00:37] mind where does it start the preaching
[1:00:40] of the building of faith comes by what
[1:00:42] faith cometh by hearing and hearing of
[1:00:47] the word of God God and Satan both
[1:00:50] approach it in the same way God will get
[1:00:53] our attention by hearing then we take it
[1:00:56] into the womb inside of us and we hear
[1:01:00] it and we receive it we accept it then
[1:01:03] it comes to fruition it begins to mature
[1:01:06] the devil's thoughts are the same way so
[1:01:09] the devil projects his thoughts in your
[1:01:12] mind so what he'll do is I'm not a very
[1:01:14] good Christian I don't have very good
[1:01:16] faith now if you're a child of God
[1:01:18] that's not you thinking that but the
[1:01:21] devil is projecting his thought into
[1:01:24] your mind
[1:01:26] so where'd it come from same place it
[1:01:29] came in the Garden of Eden the first
[1:01:31] human being that he ever battled which
[1:01:33] was Eve so she began to listen to this
[1:01:37] whenever he said yeah yes God said You
[1:01:39] shall not eat of every u fruit of the
[1:01:42] tree of the fruit of the garden they
[1:01:44] said oh well you know God has said that
[1:01:46] that we can eat of it but God has said
[1:01:48] that that you shall not eat of the tree
[1:01:50] which is in the midst of the garden and
[1:01:51] God said we should not touch it un L we
[1:01:54] die so he comes back now he's never
[1:01:57] fought with a human being before fought
[1:01:59] with angels but never fought with a
[1:02:01] human being so he's learning as he's
[1:02:03] going so he catches her and says oh
[1:02:06] there it is right there right there so
[1:02:09] what what it is you see honey God is
[1:02:12] trying to keep something from you God
[1:02:15] knows in the day that you eat thereof
[1:02:18] you'll be his
[1:02:20] gods that that thought from the devil
[1:02:23] could never hurt her that word from the
[1:02:26] devil could never hurt her until she
[1:02:29] took it in her mind thought on it pulled
[1:02:33] it down into her heart began to meditate
[1:02:37] she made the devil's thought her
[1:02:42] thought she conceived in her mind that's
[1:02:47] what he wants you and I to do now does
[1:02:49] it me mean that we're not Christians
[1:02:51] after we do that no it doesn't mean that
[1:02:53] at all it just means we've allowed him
[1:02:56] an entrance into our mind to cause an
[1:03:00] unnecessary mind battle and
[1:03:03] temporarily we laid aside our smart
[1:03:07] Bombs all of our grenades all of our
[1:03:10] drones all of our things that God gave
[1:03:13] us and we picked up the uavs from the
[1:03:16] devil and the bombs from the devil and
[1:03:19] we started talking about his ammunition
[1:03:21] because remember he only has one weapon
[1:03:25] one weapon that's all try to make you
[1:03:30] doubt your weapon that's what the
[1:03:32] prophet said that's what he's used since
[1:03:34] the very fall of Man in the beginning
[1:03:35] and he still uses the same thing today
[1:03:37] to get you and I to doubt our weapon and
[1:03:40] when he does we're defeated right there
[1:03:42] even though he's a bluff has no
[1:03:45] power now watch he
[1:03:47] says if it's contrary to the word it's
[1:03:51] the devil's
[1:03:52] thinking if it's with the word it's it's
[1:03:55] God's thinking if it's the wrong
[1:03:58] thoughts it's the
[1:04:01] devil but now wait a minute brother
[1:04:03] random I thought this question
[1:04:06] was it's in my
[1:04:08] mind well how do how does a person know
[1:04:10] if it's if it's them or the devil but
[1:04:13] watch what he's doing he's separating
[1:04:14] him said no you've done said you don't
[1:04:17] want them thoughts to be there you don't
[1:04:19] want to think that what makes you not
[1:04:22] want to think that when you were lost
[1:04:24] you did you you enjoyed thoughts of evil
[1:04:27] thoughts of wrong and thoughts of
[1:04:29] darkness and all that but once you
[1:04:31] become changed you don't enjoy that no
[1:04:33] more but yet through your same mind can
[1:04:37] pass thoughts oh my goodness if the Lord
[1:04:41] would put up here on these screens
[1:04:43] tonight thoughts that have come through
[1:04:45] all of our minds and begin to write your
[1:04:47] name and then make a list of your
[1:04:49] thoughts well let's started first let's
[1:04:51] start with
[1:04:52] me and then go to brother Joe and then
[1:04:55] do you and you and you and you probably
[1:04:58] time that got pass me there wouldn't be
[1:05:00] nobody sitting in these chairs y'all be
[1:05:02] done in your cars you'd be out down the
[1:05:04] road you said Lord have mercy I wouldn't
[1:05:07] want nobody to know what want to why why
[1:05:10] wouldn't
[1:05:11] we because it makes us
[1:05:14] ashamed and it makes us
[1:05:17] embarrassed is that right why because
[1:05:21] you love
[1:05:23] him you think it Sinners feel that way
[1:05:28] they love those
[1:05:29] thoughts they love to think on things
[1:05:32] like that but you
[1:05:35] don't so he'll put it in your mind and
[1:05:38] then condemn you for thinking what he
[1:05:40] put in your mind to do and then if we
[1:05:42] don't know the word then we say Lord is
[1:05:45] that me Lord do I think that I'm I'm
[1:05:48] sorry Lord is it me and of course every
[1:05:51] time that we ask a question yeah it's
[1:05:53] you see you ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:05:55] that's what it is you're not elect you
[1:05:58] might as well just admit it you've made
[1:05:59] some many mistakes why you know you're
[1:06:01] serpent seed so you've got the serpent
[1:06:04] himself telling you that you're serpent
[1:06:06] seed the father of Lies huh oh my he
[1:06:10] said Brother D the devil's fighting me
[1:06:12] you ought to scream hallelujah it's one
[1:06:14] of the best signs there are that he
[1:06:16] ain't got
[1:06:17] you amen notice this in the case that it
[1:06:21] may be that the devil is placing
[1:06:23] thoughts in your mind about a certain
[1:06:25] thing thing how may it be overcome or
[1:06:29] got rid of listen what an
[1:06:32] answer take the vice

[1:06:38] answer if the Devil Makes You think if
[1:06:42] the devil makes you think now listen if

[1:06:51] think that if you know you're a
[1:06:53] Christian you know you're a Christian
[1:06:56] and he tries to make you think you're
[1:06:58] not a Christian just take the vice versa
[1:07:03] I am a
[1:07:06] Christian as long as your experience
[1:07:08] matches in God's word
[1:07:10] say Don't just think
[1:07:13] it but say it why say it because your
[1:07:18] words become the progeny The Offspring
[1:07:22] the
[1:07:23] child the child
[1:07:26] of God's thought coming into your mind
[1:07:30] you accept it and you give birth to it
[1:07:34] in your confession it ain't enough just
[1:07:36] to memorize the word God wants to hear
[1:07:39] us say
[1:07:41] it praise the
[1:07:44] Lord I'm a Christian anything else the
[1:07:48] same way now listen how you answer this
[1:07:51] last part when you answer
[1:07:53] this please pray for me me to overcome
[1:07:57] this as I am not by
[1:08:02] myself so this was
[1:08:04] asked on the evening service of August
[1:08:07] the 30th
[1:08:10] 1964 here we are in May of
[1:08:17] 2024 and there's people sting right here

[1:10:06] don't make them so high and so holy
[1:10:08] don't don't dehumanize them and say oh
[1:10:10] they never go through nothing they go
[1:10:12] more through more than you'll ever
[1:10:13] believe they go through in your life
[1:10:15] sure respect them and honor them and
[1:10:17] pray for them but they're humans just
[1:10:19] like you it's one of the greatest things
[1:10:21] I found in my years of the message that
[1:10:23] the message people want to de humanize
[1:10:25] our Prophet don't dehumanize him he was
[1:10:29] a human being I'm grateful that he
[1:10:30] shared these things with us so he could
[1:10:33] give this answer he could have easily
[1:10:35] eliminated these last six or seven lines
[1:10:38] but I'm so glad he
[1:10:40] didn't don't you appreciate
[1:10:43] that I often hear that you have to love
[1:10:48] everyone but you don't have to like
[1:10:51] them dear Jesus I'm going to need your
[1:10:53] help on this one
[1:10:55] I'm confused on how can you actively
[1:11:01] dislike someone and still love
[1:11:05] them as that doesn't sound like love to
[1:11:09] me I understand that people can rub you
[1:11:12] the wrong way and some are more prickly
[1:11:16] I couldn't keep from smiling as you did
[1:11:18] whenever I read this some are more
[1:11:21] prickly than others I call them Cactus
[1:11:24] Christians
[1:11:26] more prickly than others but I always
[1:11:28] feel like I'm supposed to like them
[1:11:33] anyway can you
[1:11:35] explain true Brotherly Love does that in
[1:11:40] turn mean you like
[1:11:45] everyone
[1:11:47] wow would anybody like to answer this
[1:11:52] one often hear that you have to love
[1:11:54] every everyone but you don't have to
[1:11:57] like them now you've heard me say it
[1:12:00] many times whenever I go to counsel a
[1:12:02] young couple and I will ask them have
[1:12:04] you prayed about yeah have you prayed
[1:12:06] about it do you love each other yeah and
[1:12:09] I will talk to them and talk to them and
[1:12:11] then I will always ask this I've done it
[1:12:13] for years decades and I will ask them do
[1:12:17] you like one
[1:12:19] another and they'll do the same thing
[1:12:21] most of you did they'll
[1:12:23] smile because that they don't understand
[1:12:25] where I'm coming from because what I
[1:12:28] found as a pastor what causes a lot of
[1:12:30] marital problems in the marriage bond is
[1:12:34] that a man and wife can love one another
[1:12:37] so much they would actually die for each
[1:12:39] other if it came down to it but the
[1:12:43] longer they're married they find things
[1:12:45] about each other that they don't
[1:12:47] like so I'll just make up a few so you
[1:12:50] can get my story so a girl comes from a
[1:12:53] norm in her home a Boy comes from a norm
[1:12:57] in his home now unless he's a different
[1:13:00] unusual boy you could go into his room
[1:13:03] and you'd have no problem with his
[1:13:05] stinking sneakers sitting you know over
[1:13:08] here maybe his dirty socks his dirty
[1:13:11] shirt that he wore yesterday just takes
[1:13:13] it off and throws over there there's
[1:13:15] probably something that's different from
[1:13:16] that and then girls you know maybe their
[1:13:19] etiquette and the way that they do
[1:13:21] things would be a little bit different
[1:13:23] now you can love that person with all of
[1:13:25] your heart but you do not like certain
[1:13:28] things about their habits and what they
[1:13:31] do and you'd be surprised at some of the
[1:13:33] things that I've heard as a pastor that
[1:13:36] husbands and wives get into arguments
[1:13:38] over I'll not go into any details I'll
[1:13:41] let you experience that yourself when
[1:13:43] you get married but now we do love one
[1:13:47] another but as brothers and sisters and
[1:13:50] Christians are there things about one
[1:13:53] another that we will dis like
[1:13:58] absolutely ah you were surprised by that
[1:14:00] answer were
[1:14:01] you because God loves The
[1:14:07] Sinner but he hates the
[1:14:11] sin watch this the prophet said God
[1:14:13] hates sin but he loves The Sinner so we
[1:14:18] could love brothers and sisters we could
[1:14:21] love people but it doesn't mean we like
[1:14:24] every thing about what they do maybe
[1:14:27] their mannerisms some folks you get
[1:14:29] around them and they're just you know
[1:14:31] really rude and crude and others you get
[1:14:34] around them you think oh they are so
[1:14:36] prim and proper I could never feel
[1:14:38] comfortable being around them look at
[1:14:40] them every hair is right in place and I
[1:14:43] I can't stand that about them well and
[1:14:47] it may be different than what you are
[1:14:49] but yet in reality does that mean that
[1:14:51] you don't do not love that individual
[1:14:53] well if you don't then you need to get
[1:14:55] get more the love of God in your heart
[1:14:57] again the prophet said God hates sin but
[1:15:00] he loves The Sinner but he
[1:15:03] hates his
[1:15:06] Works
[1:15:08] hates his works so God does not like it
[1:15:13] whenever a drunk will get drunk he
[1:15:15] doesn't like it when a man will beat his
[1:15:19] wife God
[1:15:22] hates that work but he loves that sinner
[1:15:27] does that make sense to you now you see
[1:15:29] the the thing of it is if we're not
[1:15:30] careful we will identify the Sinner and
[1:15:33] the works I hate them I hate them oh no
[1:15:37] that's totally totally wrong that's not
[1:15:40] the way God does it God loves The Sinner
[1:15:44] but hates the sin we should love one
[1:15:47] another as brothers and sisters now part
[1:15:51] of what we might
[1:15:53] dislike about each other is the
[1:15:56] atmosphere that we live in and the
[1:15:59] atmosphere that we create as I just
[1:16:01] spoke a little bit about now watch this
[1:16:03] now did you ever see people nice
[1:16:06] people but you just couldn't hardly
[1:16:09] stand to be
[1:16:11] around well isn't that kind of weird so
[1:16:15] they're really nice people but you can't
[1:16:18] hardly stand to be around them
[1:16:21] huh sure you have you don't have nothing
[1:16:25] ing against them but you just can't
[1:16:28] stand to be around them then you see
[1:16:31] some person that's oh maybe a little old
[1:16:33] scrawny fella a little old woman bent
[1:16:36] over a washtub but you just love to be
[1:16:39] around that
[1:16:40] person and you just love them
[1:16:43] somehow it's the atmosphere that they've
[1:16:47] got around them the way they live they
[1:16:50] create an
[1:16:51] atmosphere that you like to be in to
[1:16:56] that's lovely people to be with again he
[1:16:59] said did you ever see someone that you
[1:17:01] love to be around sure you have there's
[1:17:04] people that you meet and associate with
[1:17:06] and you just love to be around there's
[1:17:08] an air about them that you love to
[1:17:11] associate with them and then there's
[1:17:14] fine people I want you to notice that
[1:17:16] brother random is not making them now
[1:17:18] good people and evil people but there's
[1:17:21] some that's fine he calls them fine
[1:17:24] people people that you know are very
[1:17:27] fine people and there's something about
[1:17:30] them that you just don't feel at home
[1:17:32] around them somehow and you don't want
[1:17:35] to hurt their
[1:17:37] feelings they're your
[1:17:40] friends oh my goodness you love them but
[1:17:45] there's just a difference between them
[1:17:47] and this other person well what is it we
[1:17:51] create that
[1:17:52] atmosphere that's around us
[1:17:56] now part of
[1:17:58] that is the way we think the way we are
[1:18:02] brought up the way that we've been
[1:18:05] worshiped now let me just give you a
[1:18:07] little insight every church that you've
[1:18:10] ever been to and those that you haven't
[1:18:12] every church has a
[1:18:15] personality now what makes that
[1:18:18] personality are the people who come to
[1:18:21] that church now you watch it if if a
[1:18:24] church church will start getting an
[1:18:25] influx of people people will start
[1:18:28] moving from here and there and you know
[1:18:30] different places you will watch the
[1:18:33] personality of that church and it will
[1:18:36] start
[1:18:37] changing then some of the people that
[1:18:40] were there in the original Church they
[1:18:42] will sense it and they really don't like
[1:18:45] it because they liked it the way it was
[1:18:48] before because they identified this is
[1:18:52] my church and you all stay your own
[1:18:55] church if you don't mind and leave us
[1:18:57] alone because what will it do the needs
[1:19:01] of those people moving in will start
[1:19:04] moving the ministry to where the
[1:19:06] ministry will start preaching to their
[1:19:07] needs now maybe they wasn't taught this
[1:19:10] and that at the other in their Church
[1:19:11] where they went to and their need will
[1:19:14] cause God to lay it on a preacher's
[1:19:16] heart and then the people there they're
[1:19:18] sensing a change in their church and
[1:19:20] they get scared you know how we all are
[1:19:22] about that oh oh I I don't like what's
[1:19:25] going on oh oh my goodness they're
[1:19:27] singing some new songs oh goodness
[1:19:29] they're they're not singing Rock of Ages
[1:19:32] cleff for me they're singing these new
[1:19:35] songs oh the goodness of God oh my
[1:19:38] goodness and a lot of older people they
[1:19:40] get scared out of their
[1:19:43] minds why because they can sense the
[1:19:47] personality of the church
[1:19:50] changing oh I'm sorry y'all didn't know
[1:19:52] that well I give away a preacher secret
[1:19:53] tonight didn't it so it's the same in
[1:19:56] your home man marries a woman they have
[1:20:00] a certain personality a norm in the home
[1:20:04] it will be that way for several years
[1:20:07] until they have a baby and then that
[1:20:10] baby will start changing the personality
[1:20:13] of the home then the personality will
[1:20:15] come the new Norm with mother father and
[1:20:19] the baby it will be that way for quite
[1:20:21] some time until another one comes along
[1:20:24] now this child is going to be different
[1:20:25] from the first one was a model child it
[1:20:29] went to bed at 8:00 at night and slept
[1:20:31] on 9:00 to next morning it never had the
[1:20:34] collic it never had this and that oh it
[1:20:36] was a model child and mother and father
[1:20:39] think they want another model child but
[1:20:41] guess what they get one that broke all
[1:20:45] models it cries it screams it kicks it
[1:20:48] comes red hair no offense
[1:20:53] now oh oh my goodness oh it's so
[1:20:56] different than the other what did that
[1:20:58] new baby do change the personality of
[1:21:01] the family you see what I'm
[1:21:04] saying now did the you know the first
[1:21:07] born now that's five and six years old
[1:21:09] it can't sleep at night because the
[1:21:10] baby's screaming it's squalling it's
[1:21:12] dirty stinking diapers are all over the
[1:21:15] house and this little guy is having an
[1:21:16] awful time with this new personality in
[1:21:20] the
[1:21:21] home and there probably times he wish he
[1:21:24] could take it back back to the
[1:21:25] doctor those of you that's ever been at
[1:21:27] the med center in Johnson City I have to
[1:21:29] go there a lot to visit the sick going
[1:21:31] down the hallway when you get off the
[1:21:32] elevator on the second floor you GA the
[1:21:34] elevator you go right or left rather you
[1:21:36] go left go here you make another left go
[1:21:38] down there make another left turn around
[1:21:40] go through this way and there's signs on
[1:21:42] the wall about this big it's little
[1:21:44] handwritten notes from kids it's some of
[1:21:47] them are quite funny and one of them was
[1:21:50] God I want to thank you for the baby the
[1:21:52] baby brother that you gave me but I
[1:21:54] actually ask you for a
[1:21:56] puppy so you know that's the way it is
[1:21:59] sometimes in a in a church so people
[1:22:02] come in and they come in oh no more
[1:22:04] people that means brother Donnie's going
[1:22:06] to have to counsel more and oh no I
[1:22:08] don't get enough time with him the way
[1:22:09] it is why don't all these people stay at
[1:22:13] home so each of us have our
[1:22:17] personality and we have traits about us
[1:22:20] now Carol and I as yall know we're born
[1:22:22] on the same day same month month same
[1:22:25] year I was born that morning she was
[1:22:28] born that afternoon we're born under the
[1:22:29] same star the same sign you don't
[1:22:31] believe in that look at question 64 and
[1:22:33] you see the prophet taught that to us
[1:22:35] and there's ways about us that we are so
[1:22:37] much alike it's
[1:22:39] scary and there's ways about us that is
[1:22:42] so
[1:22:44] different Carol is one of the neatest
[1:22:47] human beings that God ever let breathe a
[1:22:51] breath of
[1:22:53] life don't bny
[1:22:58] however I like being neat every now and
[1:23:03] then Carol cannot stand for a drawer to
[1:23:06] be opened in our house so upstairs I had
[1:23:10] this antique piece and in there I have
[1:23:12] screws and screwdrivers and all types of
[1:23:14] things in order to move pictures and
[1:23:18] clocks and things like that on the wall
[1:23:21] for Carol though I look at it when a
[1:23:24] picture Finds Its Place leave it there
[1:23:27] till it falls
[1:23:28] off but Carol loves
[1:23:32] change so years ago I put a hammer in
[1:23:35] there and a tape measure and a level and
[1:23:37] so on and so on so Carol wants this
[1:23:39] picture mve from here to over here will
[1:23:41] you move it sure sure I'd love
[1:23:46] to I go open the drawer I get the
[1:23:49] measuring tape I get this that the other
[1:23:52] I take it into the room I forgot maybe a
[1:23:55] you know a Wall anchor I go back guess
[1:23:58] what the drawer is
[1:24:01] shut well I know I didn't shut it cuz I
[1:24:05] knew I probably would forget
[1:24:08] something guess who come in behind me
[1:24:10] and shut
[1:24:14] it see it's written all over her face
[1:24:17] guilt I mean it's
[1:24:20] guilt now you saying I know it's funny
[1:24:22] and you say wow yeah that that's really
[1:24:24] very but you'd be surprised how many
[1:24:27] people have problems and issues over
[1:24:30] something like that now down the
[1:24:31] basement I like of food with Taxidermy
[1:24:33] so I I build all kinds of different
[1:24:35] things down there and I've got plastic
[1:24:37] cabinets from Lowe's and they stand
[1:24:39] about this time they got two doors and
[1:24:40] this one let me see let me call for my
[1:24:42] mind first one here on the right I've
[1:24:44] got Moss I've got antlers elk antlers
[1:24:47] I've got um mule deer antlers I've got
[1:24:49] white tail deer antlers second one
[1:24:51] coming there let's see open it okay I've
[1:24:53] got uh choice Cactus I've got a
[1:24:55] photographic memory I've got choya
[1:24:57] Cactus I've got glue the third one here
[1:25:00] I've got plants I've got all kinds of
[1:25:02] things so if I'm doing that I'll come
[1:25:03] down through there and I'll open them up
[1:25:05] all the way down through
[1:25:06] there Carol comes down the basement to
[1:25:09] visit
[1:25:10] me you guessed it she starts at the
[1:25:14] bottom of the
[1:25:19] steps so if I know she's coming I just
[1:25:22] go ahead and do it myself just take the
[1:25:25] fun out of it for
[1:25:30] her you know there's things like things
[1:25:33] like that that people can just get on
[1:25:37] one another's nerves
[1:25:39] over you know people have a little
[1:25:42] twitch about
[1:25:46] them have you noticed how he does
[1:25:49] that oh I can't stand that that runs all
[1:25:52] over me when he does that
[1:25:54] what is it there's something about us
[1:25:56] though as
[1:25:59] humans that other people's things like
[1:26:02] that bother us we say I just don't like
[1:26:05] being around them I just don't like
[1:26:08] them it don't mean you don't love them
[1:26:11] they are preacher friends that I have
[1:26:13] around the
[1:26:14] world I will never be as close to them
[1:26:18] as I am the brothers in our church here
[1:26:22] brother Ron Spencer is one of my CL
[1:26:24] friends brother Tim put I consider them
[1:26:27] probably two of my closest
[1:26:30] friends brother Fred Mullins another one
[1:26:32] of my closest friends I've got preacher
[1:26:35] friends all over the world by the
[1:26:37] thousands of them but yet if I would be
[1:26:41] around them and they would be around me
[1:26:42] they say man a little of brother Donnie
[1:26:46] goes a long
[1:26:47] way because my human makeup would be
[1:26:50] there I ain't talking about Sin you
[1:26:52] understand what I'm saying so there's
[1:26:53] people that were more compatible with
[1:26:56] watch brother bman we'll close with
[1:26:59] this now you might say I sure don't like
[1:27:02] brother Neville or I sure don't like
[1:27:04] brother Jones and I don't like brother
[1:27:06] Sona or something like
[1:27:08] that but just let something happen to
[1:27:11] him
[1:27:13] brother your heart's
[1:27:16] broke it nearly kills
[1:27:20] you we can obtain brotherly kindness
[1:27:24] and a feeling for one another but to
[1:27:27] maintain it in a group of people why do
[1:27:29] you care for that brother because you
[1:27:32] broke bread with him here at the altar
[1:27:35] as you will
[1:27:36] tonight you fellowship with
[1:27:39] him you shook his hand you worship with
[1:27:42] him he's your brother he might do
[1:27:45] something in the flesh that you would
[1:27:48] disagree with and cause you kind of stay
[1:27:51] which we ought and and notice what he
[1:27:53] says here
[1:27:54] we oughtn't to do it but shun him a
[1:27:58] little bit don't you love the honesty of
[1:28:00] this
[1:28:01] Prophet but in the bottom of your heart
[1:28:05] if something
[1:28:06] happened to that brother it would nearly
[1:28:10] kill
[1:28:11] you or that sister I'm an old man and I
[1:28:14] was once young and now I'm old and I've
[1:28:17] seen it down through the age do that
[1:28:19] here people say well I just don't have
[1:28:20] no more to do with him and something
[1:28:22] happened to that man and it nearly kills
[1:28:25] you he thinks oh God I let my precious
[1:28:30] brother
[1:28:31] go without making friends with him
[1:28:36] see it's Brotherly
[1:28:39] Love there may be people in our church
[1:28:42] that you will never be compatible with I
[1:28:46] encourage you go out of your circle go
[1:28:49] out of your comfort zone and try to be
[1:28:52] friends with people I'm not tell you do
[1:28:54] something I don't do myself I do I reach
[1:28:56] out to preachers and sometimes I may
[1:28:58] have preachers to come and preach for us
[1:29:00] and you think why would brother Donnie
[1:29:02] do that I know they differ in Doctrine I
[1:29:05] know that they don't
[1:29:06] agree but can you imagine how many
[1:29:09] churches brother brandham would have
[1:29:11] preached in if he would have only
[1:29:13] preached in
[1:29:15] churches that agreed with
[1:29:19] him things that are to be preached in
[1:29:22] Rialto California
[1:29:26] 12765 one of the last sermons that he
[1:29:29] preached preached in an Assembly of God
[1:29:33] Church he preaches on Election preaches
[1:29:36] on predestination goes into the godhead
[1:29:38] and the young man there was was a pastor
[1:29:40] was an Assembly of God brother B didn't
[1:29:42] agree with that man but the man invited
[1:29:45] him to come and
[1:29:47] preach so what do we do we love one
[1:29:50] another brotherly kindness goes beyond
[1:29:53] our dislikes for one another well I
[1:29:56] don't know if I'll ever be close friends
[1:29:58] with that brother that sister well you
[1:30:00] may not but you can at least try and if
[1:30:03] you can't find that compatibility where
[1:30:05] you'll be the best of friends after all
[1:30:08] that's why we have friends and we have
[1:30:10] best friends do we not there's preachers
[1:30:14] around the world that I could contact
[1:30:17] them tonight if I was in need of prayer
[1:30:19] and I would feel perfectly fine with
[1:30:22] doing that but if I was really going un
[1:30:26] through something and I needed a
[1:30:28] preacher to really reach out to and
[1:30:31] contact brother I need a friend to talk
[1:30:34] to believe it or not it's really hard
[1:30:37] for a preacher to find
[1:30:39] that because some preachers have got
[1:30:41] longer tongues than about anybody you
[1:30:44] know of they gossip they talk about this
[1:30:48] and that and the
[1:30:49] other I hope you don't think less of me
[1:30:52] but I try preachers
[1:30:54] I try them I'll tell them something they
[1:30:58] may think it's top secret but I know it
[1:31:01] ain't and I'll see in a month or two or
[1:31:05] three or four if that comes through the
[1:31:08] loop and it comes back to me and I know
[1:31:13] I won't trust that old boy and I did it
[1:31:16] for a
[1:31:17] reason God does us the same way so the
[1:31:21] thing that we never want to do is be so
[1:31:23] so clannish and so clicky in our own
[1:31:27] ways and I know our church has them
[1:31:29] every church has them if every Pastor
[1:31:31] would just be honest because there's
[1:31:33] people we feel closer to but that does
[1:31:36] not mean we should ever treat anyone bad
[1:31:40] and if you're in a certain category
[1:31:42] financially you should never look down
[1:31:45] on those that don't have what you have
[1:31:48] or maybe in your education you're
[1:31:50] Superior well I graduated from high
[1:31:53] school you outdone me cuz I
[1:31:56] didn't I've been thinking about getting
[1:31:58] my GED what do y'all think you think I
[1:32:00] need it you think it' make me a better
[1:32:02] preacher no you don't think all right
[1:32:03] thank you he discouraged me from doing
[1:32:05] it right there didn't take much did he
[1:32:08] but you see even though there'd be
[1:32:10] things that would
[1:32:12] differ if you ever had it to happen to
[1:32:14] you where maybe somebody you really
[1:32:16] didn't feel that close to and yet you
[1:32:18] hear oh my goodness oh something
[1:32:20] happened to him oh goodness oh Lord
[1:32:22] please don't let nothing happen to him
[1:32:24] Lord please you understand what that was
[1:32:27] that was the real love of God in your
[1:32:31] heart it was able to go past a certain
[1:32:34] thing a certain preacher got me great
[1:32:37] damage oh oh my
[1:32:40] goodness several several years ago just
[1:32:44] like to tore my heart out of
[1:32:46] me I didn't think I was ever going to
[1:32:48] get over
[1:32:49] it and I heard that something happened
[1:32:52] to the man
[1:32:55] and I I was so
[1:32:57] grateful with a feeling that I had it
[1:33:01] was not one of vindictiveness it was not
[1:33:04] one of oh boy God's getting back at
[1:33:07] him it was one of sympathy and I felt
[1:33:11] sorry for it I'll probably never be
[1:33:13] close friends with that man there was a
[1:33:16] preacher done something to me when I was
[1:33:18] a child it's affected me my entire
[1:33:21] life I saw him several years years ago
[1:33:24] at my aunt's funeral in
[1:33:25] Kentucky I had seen him for a long time
[1:33:29] Carol was sitting by me in the funeral
[1:33:31] home as you come up to the aisle on a
[1:33:37] walker and Carol grabbed a hold of my
[1:33:39] hand squeeze it you okay you okay
[1:33:43] yeah sweat pouring down my face my heart
[1:33:47] racing I could feel my blood pressure as
[1:33:49] it went up and my face
[1:33:52] flushed because of what that man done to
[1:33:56] me scarred me for my entire
[1:34:02] life but I was so happy for the feeling
[1:34:06] that I had when
[1:34:09] I and the Lord helped me to be able to
[1:34:11] get my composure
[1:34:14] together and I looked at him he didn't
[1:34:18] see me
[1:34:19] first he walked up to the casket viewed
[1:34:22] the body
[1:34:24] turned around and when he turned
[1:34:27] around his eyes fell on
[1:34:31] me I was looking at him he was looking
[1:34:34] at
[1:34:35] me first time I'd seen him in many
[1:34:39] years my flashbacks were not
[1:34:43] good my memories were not
[1:34:47] pleasant but down in my heart what I
[1:34:51] felt was pity
[1:34:54] not
[1:34:56] anger not
[1:34:58] hatred and I whispered a prayer through
[1:35:01] my tears through my
[1:35:05] sweat I was so nervous sitting there my
[1:35:08] feet were bouncing off the floor like
[1:35:11] that but I pray God forgive
[1:35:15] him help
[1:35:17] him to make
[1:35:21] peace is that the way you want to feel
[1:35:33] sphe Lord
[1:35:36] Jesus thank you for this time we can
[1:35:39] spend together like
[1:35:42] this Lord I Thank you for our
[1:35:46] use Lord God what I would have given to
[1:35:50] be able to attend a youth service onever
[1:35:53] I give my heart to you as a
[1:35:56] boy my to be able to ask
[1:36:01] questions Lord now we moved into a day
[1:36:04] that you're mindful of your use
[1:36:08] Lord you want them to be able to have
[1:36:10] places where they can meet and
[1:36:12] fellowship I pray that our youth would
[1:36:15] never take it and that it become so
[1:36:18] common to them Lord that they don't
[1:36:20] realize how sacred it
[1:36:22] is what would have give for a minister
[1:36:25] when I started preaching at
[1:36:26] 18 what I would have given for an elder
[1:36:30] that I could looked up to as a mentor
[1:36:32] that I could have asked him
[1:36:34] questions received instruction from
[1:36:36] Brother tell me how how to study tell me
[1:36:39] tell me how to yield to the Holy Ghost
[1:36:42] help help me brother help
[1:36:44] me and yet I see some of the preachers
[1:36:47] in this message that are so
[1:36:50] arrogant that you offer to try to help
[1:36:53] them
[1:36:54] but they don't want your
[1:36:56] help they want to get in your pull
[1:36:59] pit they want you to recommend them to
[1:37:02] somebody but they want nothing from you
[1:37:05] as far as spiritual
[1:37:08] input and I have to say it it's fearful
[1:37:11] Lord and I think is that the next
[1:37:14] generation of message
[1:37:17] preachers it's not about how they can
[1:37:20] serve God's people but what they they
[1:37:22] can get out of of it what kind of a
[1:37:25] following they can
[1:37:27] have Lord Jesus we love you tonight
[1:37:32] father oh search our hearts
[1:37:35] Lord may we take these things dear
[1:37:38] God may
[1:37:40] we know how to fight the enemy a little
[1:37:42] better after this question about
[1:37:45] thoughts Lord after this one
[1:37:48] about liking one another and maybe
[1:37:51] certain people that we don't like their
[1:37:53] Atmos sphere
[1:37:55] and may we see deep down Lord that we
[1:37:58] love people and it would break our heart
[1:38:01] to hear of anything happening
[1:38:03] Lord we want more of your love
[1:38:07] Jesus oh forgive us of our wrongs Lord
[1:38:11] of our
[1:38:13] shortcomings make us more like you
[1:38:17] Jesus praise the Lord can we stand
[1:38:20] together

[1:40:18] mey
[1:40:19] Spirit love through me
[1:40:28] amen do you enjoy that
[1:40:30] tonight you know in
[1:40:32] Warfare part of fighting War for uh a
[1:40:37] war fighting a battle is having
[1:40:40] intelligence and tonight you received a
[1:40:43] lot of more intelligence than Satan
[1:40:45] wanted you to
[1:40:47] have tonight you you asked a question on
[1:40:50] how do I fight this
[1:40:54] so you came in here tonight and you
[1:40:56] found out a tactic that the devil uses
[1:40:58] on you and how to overcome it you know I
[1:41:02] like to I few months ago last last fall
[1:41:06] last winter I went through something
[1:41:09] mentally um I've preached at a church in
[1:41:12] another state and had an8 hour drive
[1:41:16] home and in that 8 hour drive home Satan
[1:41:19] talked to me for 8
[1:41:22] hours trying to tell me something Satan
[1:41:25] will put something in your mind and make
[1:41:27] you think it's
[1:41:28] God that's one of his
[1:41:31] tactics I got home I went to bed and I
[1:41:35] couldn't sleep I was tormented so
[1:41:38] much I I heard my own voice talking to
[1:41:42] me like I'm talking to you right
[1:41:44] now I wasn't talking I wasn't saying
[1:41:47] anything but I heard my own voice
[1:41:50] telling me you've got to do this God
[1:41:52] wants you to do this you got got to go
[1:41:53] do this and I was in
[1:41:55] torment never been that tormented in my
[1:41:58] life and I got up early the next morning
[1:42:02] and I I called brother Donnie
[1:42:05] and and just simple as he makes it seem
[1:42:09] so
[1:42:10] simple he said brother Joe God don't
[1:42:13] torment that's simple God don't
[1:42:16] torment so them thoughts that you
[1:42:19] get so often that that's torment you
[1:42:23] like brother benett said there's only
[1:42:25] two forces that work in our life there's
[1:42:27] two forces one's the devil one's God
[1:42:29] it's not you God and the
[1:42:32] devil but Satan's got a job to do that's
[1:42:35] what what I I love so much that that
[1:42:38] question that was asked tonight about
[1:42:39] our thoughts Satan's got a job to do you
[1:42:43] might overcome that thought you might
[1:42:45] pray and God take that thought away from
[1:42:46] you Satan's got another one
[1:42:50] coming but I always thought this if he
[1:42:53] would get in the mind of Jesus
[1:42:56] Christ cuz the Bible tells us that he
[1:42:58] took Jesus to the temple Satan took him
[1:43:00] Jesus didn't follow him Satan took him
[1:43:04] and he tempted him all this will I give
[1:43:07] you brother brandom said and how can I
[1:43:08] overcome say Jesus was tempted to do it
[1:43:12] so if he's going to tempt Jesus
[1:43:14] Christ who are
[1:43:16] we that's the battle we have to fight
[1:43:18] too every day one Split Second
[1:43:21] millisecond before the Rapture takes
[1:43:22] place Place Satan's going to be in your
[1:43:25] mind so take take that with us tonight
[1:43:28] you know and the other question you know
[1:43:31] I when it talks about like loving one
[1:43:33] another and being friends I like to
[1:43:36] quote the great scholar Rob
[1:43:39] Weber try to make a new friend this
