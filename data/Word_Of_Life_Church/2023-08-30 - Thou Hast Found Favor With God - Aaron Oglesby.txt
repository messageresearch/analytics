a men's Bow Shoot in Ohio I think there's a church there that puts uh kind of that gets the event together Brother David Seiler preached that weekend on Sunday morning said the Lord had been dealing with him about love lately how important the Capstone is said he's able to share a little bit with a girl at the gas station so then today came to get something to eat talking to a gentleman in the lobby and expressing to him how much love is missing in our society he said he went to order and there was a gentleman with his nephew turned around and paid for his lunch and the gentleman that he was speaking with also got a chance to witness to another right there in the lobby and then he asked if he wouldn't mind praying so he took their hat off prayed right there in the lobby of the restaurant set just a confirmation from God showing him charity of love and charity it said how important it is to be mindful of one another said the Lord had laid brother hang on just a second I lost my place here I think brother Wayne I think is what said labor of the way on his heart and said that he had called him and he was pulling into urgent care with his father and it said just spoke to him that he could just pray for the situation right there said the Lord delayed him on his heart and said God uses his body for one another and said just be willing and sensitive of that small still voice that says praise God hallelujah thank you to you all amen just wanted to talk about how that the Lord sometimes lays people on our hearts and you know we shouldn't take that lightly sometimes the Lord

encourage your people just to keep fighting the battle Lord Lord and that we can get that deep down in our soul tonight that we've got Jesus what more could we possibly want Lord regardless of where the world is and what struggles and battles we're fighting if we got Jesus it's going to be okay and we thank you for that Assurance tonight Lord we just ask now that you'll come and bless the word and bless the remainder of this service father in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles with you and you'd like to turn with me to the Book of Luke the first chapter in the 26th verse I'm thankful to have my my wife sister Lydia with me and and my two sons Jude and Jackson are also traveling with me it's nice to when you're on the road to have some of home with you that's for sure amen and we feel so welcome and comfortable here we really do it's another Another Part of home we love you and God bless you verse 26 says in and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this thing be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Barren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her amen I pray that the Lord will add His blessings as you have your seats amen I was just in prayer for tonight's service and I've said this before but I used to never would take my coat off because I had a little bit of a complex about how fat I was and then I saw myself with my coat on I said it didn't help none so I might as well get comfortable so might as well be comfortable amen as I was looking into what to minister and and the Lord just laid this on my heart and and I was torn between two thoughts and he began to lead me this way and my instructions were to encourage so we're here to encourage and put our shoulder to the wheel and to encourage tonight up I love this account of Mary's visitation and the conversation that she has here with the angel and brother Brown will take this story of Mary's going to the well and he dramatizes it in several different places and and he really begins to bring it to life and I want to minister to you tonight on the thought thou has found favor with God thou have found favor with God and and brother Branham takes this story and and when he does he talks about how Joseph and Mary had gone to service that day and they had gone into the service and brother Branham says it had been a wonderful service and that that the rabbi there had talked about how God had brought them out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and and how they when they came down to the Red Sea that that God had parted the Red Sea for them and and when they needed food that God had reigned Manna down from heaven and that God had brought water out of a rock and that God had rolled back to Jordan and how when they got there there had not been a feeble one amongst them even though they had been wandering in the wilderness and the rabbi talked about Victory after Victory after Victory and bro Brown says it was a wonderful Service as he talked about what a great God that they had he said but brother Branham goes on to say he says but then he ruined the service says it was a wonderful message but at the end of it the rabbi ruined the whole thing by saying God just doesn't operate like that anymore he said it wasn't necessary anymore he said the people have settled in the Homeland and they don't need the god of Miracles anymore and I'll tell you they'll ruin a service for me pretty quick if we start taking that tone as well you can lay it out as best as you can and have the most beautiful power points and speak eloquently but if we start talking down the line that God don't do that anymore I'm gonna tell you real quick that just ruined the service for me that's where I check out that's where I get off that train because let me be here to tell you tonight God still does that God still moves that way and I still need him to move that way in my life amen listen too many times we get the attitude of wasn't God great wasn't it awesome the way that God used to heal and God did those things just to get people's attention until he could get them settled back in the homeland of the word oh but now that we're settled down we don't need the supernatural anymore we don't need the god of miracles in him listen they may not say it with their words but with their attitudes they do with their attitudes those things come out and and too many times we're relating the testimonies as if there's something that has to stay in the past God did God did God did yes sir God did but why do we tell testimonies not to talk about how great he was but to remind you of what he can do right now in this moment in this service today it's not about how great he was I'd love to testify but it's to remind me that if I'm sick he healed today if somebody's lost he saves today if you need the Holy Ghost he feels today because he is the same yesterday today and forever amen I'm not against testifying I believe in it but for the purpose of building faith for now that is the purpose of our testimonies what does God want to do tonight what does he want to do in our midst right now because listen hopefully we're not gathered here tonight to fulfill a religious Duty hopefully that's not our intentions and just coming together and and hearing a good service and and maybe hearing A good sermon listen the days of just having good sermons and going home and saying wasn't that great that needs to be over what did that good sermon do what did God do for you how were you changed how were you molded how did God interact listen he is a living God and he's in our midst tonight and he wants to operate in this building tonight at your seat not just somebody else's seat it might be good for them and you're sitting there going oh that's good that brother needs it that brother needs it but how about you find a spoonful for yourself find a shovel for yourself and feed on the word say God deal with me tonight move tonight discern my heart tonight Hallelujah I believe there's a living God in our midst I believe it's going home time I believe it's time for prodigals to come home Justin it sure was good to see you singing I sure bless my heart and there's more of that there's more out there but listen we got a promise we got a promise and the promises of God are just as good as God himself and he says if I've got Jesus I've got everything if I got a promise my son's coming he's coming if I got a promise of healing I'm Healed if I got a promise of Deliverance I'm delivered just stand on the word tonight he is the same yesterday today and forever there's Chronicles coming home there's Deliverance coming to your house their salvation coming to your house Hallelujah I've heard testimonies from this very place about prodigals there's more coming there's more coming just let it be a sheep way there's more coming oh I can't wait to see the day where you can't find a seat in this place just because of the prodigals that have come back why we need all these seats cause there's more coming we're gonna blow this place apart it's gonna fill it up there's more coming I'm expecting more listen some folks believe this isn't the season for miracles how can we be on the verge of the rapture the change of our bodies which will be the biggest most total and complete Mass Divine Healing in history and it not be the season for miracles it has to be the season for miracles because I'm about to get one I'm about to have one and I know there's been Miracles Happening Here service after service but pretty soon it's going to sweep across don't tell me it's not the season for miracles it's the season of the body change it's the season of The Rapture it's the season for God to pour it out like never before I'm expecting more God bless more Supernatural more moving of the spirit more power more Revelation I'll take it all I'm expecting more Hallelujah our expectations should always be for more I say pour out more Lord pour out more or less come expecting more and creating an atmosphere for more let the spirit Move Free In Worship let the spirit move free in preaching let the spirit Move Free and now listen I say the only thing that we need to bind up is the devil it's time to bind up sickness bind up complexes bind up hatred bind up bitterness and let the spirit free let your brothers and sisters be free but let's bind up the enemy tonight quit throwing stones at our brothers and start throwing them at the Devil quick tying up our brothers and let's bind up the devil tonight Hallelujah listen we don't have time for cold and formal we don't have time for just another Wednesday night service it's time to manifest what he manifested listen these are beautiful quotes bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Pirates power she is it's got to be more than quotes we got to begin to manifest what he manifested it's time that fruit begins to come forth It's Time to let God out of the box and just let him move yeah listen it ain't something we're trying to work up it ain't something you have to work up because if he's Divine and we're the branches then every branch that comes of that bind will bear the same fruit so if the very first Branch came out of that vine wrote a book of Acts we know the quote but when's it going to be more than a quote then this branch is going to Bear the same fruit as the first branch and you don't have to work it up you just got to be who you are you just got to let the life of the vine flow through the branch and it'll produce the works listen if you work it up and if you work up a run and work up a shot I don't want it I don't want it but when it's the Life coming out of the vine flowing into the branch I say I don't want to stop it just flow Lord Jesus flow Lord Jesus move how you want to move in this service tonight we don't have to work it up it's just who we are it's Who We Are we've returned to the original we just have to let him do what it is that he wants to do and get out of the way too many times we want to blame the devil for all the hindrances and a lot of times we're the hindrance go back and look at the word and in the book of Acts and and almost every single time that you find a major outpouring or a major event it'll start off by saying they were in one mind and one Accord and then this happened one mind and one Accord and then this happened and I wonder what percentage honestly have we ever had of everybody in One mind and one Accord and I I think if we gave it 50 we'd be doing pretty good and we've had some pretty amazing services with the failing grade that's an if what would happen if more of has got in one mind more of us gotten one Accord and right now you weren't thinking about Thursday you weren't thinking about what happened yesterday and you sure wasn't thinking about that brother that offended you 10 years ago but you were here thinking I need Jesus tonight I need Jesus to move tonight I need him to heal tonight I need him to fill the night Jesus Break Forth in this place tonight I need you pour yourself out tonight we let so many things distract us and pull us from what we really need to happen tonight we need him to break out in this place like never before right now in this moment in this service and we're making it about a service if I want to make it about you God wants to move for you God wants to move in your situation he wants to display his power on your behalf and listen God is willing and able but he's looking for people who will take him out his word somebody that will believe no matter what anybody else says or no matter what the doctor says and no matter what the symptoms say someone who doesn't just quote Hebrews 13 8. but they believe it for their current situation for right now for today where I'm standing what I'm facing Hebrews 13 8. amen the rabbi that day believe that the miraculous was a thing of the past brother Brown said somehow that didn't satisfy the thirst and the hunger of Joseph and Mary listen that kind of stuff's never going to satisfy the hunger and thirst on the inside of a True Believer brother Branham goes on to say our Traditions our church Creeds will never satisfy a heart that's been called of God you cannot make him say the Apostles Creed or be sprinkled or something like that and be satisfied with it when the hunger of God is in his soul he will go back to Pentecost to the beginning and find the real holy ghost that sets his heart of Fire Lord set my heart on fire tonight I need more tonight brother Aaron have you been filled with the Holy Ghost yes sir but I want more tonight brother Branham said that the Dynamics of this bride would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost so Lord I need it if you said that's what we're going to have pour it out on me listen it is it's okay to testify of the past but it is never okay to be satisfied with what he did in the past it's okay to testify but it's not okay to be satisfied because when you get to the place that it's all in the past and it's not an Artesian well that's beginning to spring up and flow forth then suddenly you become stagnant and you begin to dry up and you become spiritually dehydrated you know if you look at it and I'm a medical person so if I get this wrong forgive me but the general consensus is that a person can live three to four days without anything to drink somewhere in there according to what I read maybe longer I don't know but let's just say three to four days you begin to really shut down well let's apply that to spiritually you telling me you're going from Wednesday to Sunday without anything to drink you're not taking a drink from Sunday to Wednesday try that no don't try that I don't want anybody sick but you know how thirsty you'd be how you wouldn't be able to function properly you wouldn't be able to manifest properly you wouldn't be the person that you normally are and if you're not drinking and you're not drinking brother Brandon says drink and push out and drink and push out and drink and drink and drink and drink the problem is a lot of y'all been sober too long all right it's time we start drinking again and not just on Sunday but let's drink on Monday and drink on Tuesday and drink on Wednesday and drink on Thursday that guy sounds like he's got a drinking problem yes sir and push out and drink and push out and drink and manifest that life from the inside of you quit going from service to service without drinking drink be strong listen the 50s were awesome the 60s were awesome but what about today Camp was awesome your dedication meetings were awesome hey Sunday was awesome but what about today what about right now what about tonight oh brother Aaron you're all about listen I'm all about what he said we could have I'm all about the promises that are in this book and I know I can't make it without each and every one of them so the reason I'm preaching this way is because I need God that opened the Red Sea to open up problems in my life tonight I need the god that Rain Man Out Of Heaven to feed my soul tonight I need God that moved as the fourth man in a fiery furnace to come down and move in my situation tonight I need God to be real and living and moving I can't make it any other way I need the pillar of fire that was in Moses day Paul's name William branham's day I need that Pillar of Fire tonight I need it right now not new to theology not something dried up the intellectual Doctrine not a better argument listen we didn't get this message so we could argue with people I need Hebrews 13 8 manifested I need John 14 12 in action and he expects it to be in action pardon me amen too many of us become satisfied with religion will become satisfied with religion the Pharisees became satisfied with religion but we can't get to the place to a religion satisfies us brother Brown said and Mary said you know since I heard the rabbi say that this great God that brought us here and made us what we are that he doesn't have to do things for us now like he did then I've been thinking for a long time if this God was as great in the Days of Our Fathers as he was in the days of our grandfathers then why isn't he just the same great God today that's only good thinking he says that's only good thinking you see Mary wanted something more and when and whenever you get to the place that you're not satisfied where you're at and you begin to hunger and thirst and long for More and You Begin to seek more you will get more why haven't I got anything lately brother and have you been seeking or have you been showing up because there's a big difference between seeking and showing up all right there listen there will be no perfect attendance Awards in heaven it's not about just showing up but when you're here are you seeking are you feeding are you pulling or you're growing are you recognizing what you're here for what the purpose of it is for the prophet would say that Mary and Joseph read from the scroll of Isaiah that afternoon and he says they read about the coming savior unto us a child is born and this is what she was dwelling on that day as she was walking down that little path going to the well listen there's a lesson right there we can learn what are you dwelling on what are we thinking on what are we talking about when we're with our friends what about what are our conversations consist of what where are we at on a daily basis and I get it I understand that life's busy listen there's things we have to do that life is stressful the world is crazy 401s are crashing everywhere there's a lot to think about there's a lot that that fills up our mind and so much running through our minds but if we can ever just stop and get our minds back on him if we can come back and get our Focus back on him then that's when we can have a visitation like Mary Had Mary's belief 1961 he said Hail Mary you're highly favored before God oh I like that that little woman in the meanest City there was in the world the meanest City there was in the world at the time known to be the meanest City in Palestine and in there she had lived such a life until God chose her for a certain work that he was going to do there she looked into his face and it startled her you know it's usually usually as we are thinking on those things the Bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things I think the reason we don't see no more of it than we do is we got our minds on too many other things I think the Angels would still appear to us if we only kept our minds upon them but we're thinking about something else like where we're going a certain program we got to look at or certain shopping we got to do not sinful things just not giving him the thoughts not giving him the attention that he deserves and our minds are thinking on this and thinking on this and I say tonight let's turn our minds back to our mind back to his promises tonight let's turn our mind back to his goodness let's turn our mind back to his worthiness let's turn our mind back on on him tonight and let's begin to prepare for a visitation let's begin to prepare for a visitation not just talk about it no it's great that this happened to this one it's great why don't you begin to prepare for a visitation put your mind on it put your thoughts on it begin to ask God and pray for God because listen you may be in turmoil right now this may be the worst day you've ever had the most worst week you've ever had the worst month or the worst year but listen to me One Moment In The Presence of almighty God one moment will turn that around listen you can run from God for years and years and years and years and years and Satan can put in decades into your life and then you step into that presence just one time and it'll change everything it'll turn your life in around in a moment let your son have a visitation let your daughter have a visitation let your home have a visitation it'll fix marriages it'll bring young people back it'll take that bitterness out of your heart it'll do it all in one moment that's why we prepare for visitations because visitations can change everything in a moment not only be prepared but be looking because just because you don't recognize it doesn't mean it wasn't your opportunity there's a lot of people came in contact with Jesus and walked away unchanged because they didn't recognize their opportunity in his presence look for that opportunity prepare for a visitation because it only takes a moment the Fourth Man in the fire boy it seemed like it was too late but in one moment's time he took what what was sure death and turned it into an incredible testimony let him begin to work in your life and move in your life listen let's be like Abraham sitting in the tent door looking for him If Abraham would have been looking down the Sodom or arguing with his wife or doing all those things he might have walked right on pass but he was in the tent door looking and because he was in the tent door looking and he hosted him and he had his visitation there was a body change that came amen who's he appearing to people who are preparing for a visitation people who are thinking on him Philippians 4 and 8 says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are on us whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things and the times that Mary lived in wasn't exactly just peaceful times that were rocking along where everything was smooth but Mary lived in a time that was actually very similar to our time it was a time of great trouble it's actually considered a bad time in the history of a place that was already a very troubled land it was a time of religious and political upheaval violent rebellions taking place evil leadership Roman occupation and the Romans were influencing everything and the Jews were all separated and bickering and arguing and fighting amongst themselves and it was in this type of atmosphere that Jesus comes on the same it's in that type of atmosphere that that Jesus shows up so what am I saying don't be discouraged by the things that you see around you tonight don't be discouraged by the fact that the world is falling apart all around you don't let it get you down what is it brother Aaron why is all this happening it's called end time conditions that's exactly what we're dealing with it's income end time conditions and this isn't the first in time that's ever been on the face of the Earth there have been other end times and every time there was an end time it was full of blatant evil instability so sin and it's always an anti-god climate there was an end time in Noah's day and in reference to the climate Genesis 6 and 5. and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually there was an end time for Sodom and in reference to that condition Genesis 13 13 but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly and according to Luke we can expect that exact same thing in this day Luke 17 26 as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man skip down to verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot and then verse 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so as you look at each and every end time that's come before us as they did all that we're experiencing with the evil and the corruption and the instability is just end time conditions it's part of what's supposed to be here and Mary is living there in the ending of the Jewish dispensation and she's experiencing these conditions brother Branham says right in the middle of the most wicked city right in the midst of the world falling apart right in the midst of riots in the streets constant unrest and in the middle of all that Mary's mind is on the Lord in the midst of all that she's not wondering well I wonder if herod's going to get reelected or if that guy that there indicting is going to come back and get reelected and maybe we'll get this one in office and maybe they'll turn this and maybe listen when are we going to learn that the people in office are nothing more than Paul's in the hands of God and the ones that are there there for a reason to get us in the end time condition and here we are but she's walking in the middle of that and her mind is on the Lord her mind is God is good God is great I believe God is alive I believe God still moves I believe God is still The Miracle Worker and in the midst of that in the midst of that all of a sudden a flicker of light and an angel sits out with a message and says Hail Mary Thou Art highly favored Church listen in that moment the unrest didn't matter no more in that moment the politics didn't matter no more in that matter what was going on in this church and that church and what this one was saying and that none of that mattered anymore in that moment all she cared about was there's a message coming to me from an angel and I want to listen to that message and I want to hold on to that message and he told her you're highly favored the Lord is with thee Oh What a message that we receive in this day a flicker of light a pillar of fire and a message that came out and said you are highly favored the world Fallen apart but you're favored the world's going down to hell but you're favored it's all in chaos oh but there's a people tonight that's found favor with God every end times had an awful condition every end time seemed like the world had gone completely insane but every end time also had something else a people who found favor with God Abraham found favor Noah found favor you have found favor listen just because the end times getting to where the world's getting more wicked and more wicked and we stand and we go oh it's getting bad it's getting worse it's getting worse don't fail to realize that if the world is in an in time condition there has to be a bride on the face of the Earth that has come to her position in the end time Rapture condition brother random said we're always talking about how Wicked the world is and we're failing to recognize how powerful the church is all the time oh it's wicked yes sir but there is a power in The Bride of Jesus Christ there is a restored word there is a living God moving in our midst tonight Hallelujah amen amen let's get our eyes off the negativity of the end time tonight because we've been restored back there's a bride adorned there's a bride in Rapture condition there is a bride who has found favor with the groom listen recognizing tonight that we have found favor with almighty God that ought to get our faith off the ground that ought to get our faith lifted up to go through every trial in every situation that we face you you who's he talking to right you have found favor with God you have found favor you are highly favored there in verse 28 the angel says hell Thou Art highly favored comma the Lord is with thee so with his favor comes his never failing presence because it's never a failing presence listen the Lord is with thee oh why should I fear when Giants come calling my name what is it that I have to worry about not only am I favored but I got a captain and he's not walking behind me but he's going before me I'm telling you tonight in your trial in your situation in your sickness in your heart hey Thou Art highly favored and the Lord is with you listen all men have trouble all men have trials but you get to face your trial tonight with the favor of almighty God you face your trial tonight knowing that he's by your side and holding your hand I say hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus for your favor in my life thank you when I know that I'm highly favored when I know that the Lord is with me listen is exactly what he told Gideon over in judges six he said the Lord is with thee he tells him that right before he gives him his Commission and I say with that you'll have all you ever need you'll have all you ever need knowing that the Lord is with you what mountain can face you what devil can overrun you what sickness and what trial when the King of Kings the one who conquered every sickness goes before you the one who overcame every every devil goes before you the one who overcame death Hell In The Grave it goes before you and he's walking with you and you're in his favor what do I have to worry about what do we have to fear tonight it's time we recognize who is here wants to think for just a second the angel is about to ask Mary to believe something that seems impossible she has no examples to go off of she does have the scripture that says Behold a virgin shall conceive but she has no example of this ever coming to pass he's about to tell her that she's going to have a child even though she doesn't know a man and he tells her two things to raise her faith to a level that she can receive about what she's about to hear Thou Art highly favored and the Lord is with him listen there's great challenges ahead there may be some horrible trials in your future and I'm not here to be a downer I'm just speaking real you may be in the middle of it now but there's also great Miracles ahead there's also a Rapture and a body change of hand and he sent a message to elevate our faith to a place to receive that body change and what did he tell us Thou Art highly favored and I am with you listen he didn't just say he was here he proved he was here night after night time after time service after service he would challenge the devil and he proved there was a living God in our midst and I want to tell you that didn't end in 1965 but he's still here he's still proving it he's still moving he's still healing sick he's still bringing back Chronicles he's still saving the laws he is a living God and he's here tonight and he's reminding you I'm with you I'm with you in the fire I'm with you in the blood I'm with you in the sickness you have my favor [Applause] brother Branham says and we know he lives because he's with us and proves himself by physical signs and wonders that he promised that he would do to show it and so much as a pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness it's with us today even having its picture taken performing the signs and wonders that he promised it would do in this day seeing all the words that he promised being made manifest in this day well brother Aaron that was all for when the prophet was here okay he says and when he went away he said now the same thing that I've done you'll do also for I'll be with you always to the end of the world you'll do the same thing I've done until the end of the world listen I know sometimes it feels like it's all over but we're still here it has an officially ended yet so as long as we're still here he's still with us he's still moving he's still saving he's the same yesterday today and forever and that doesn't change until the end of the world you need healing he's the Healer tonight you need Deliverance he's the deliverer tonight you need salvation in your home he's the Savior tonight and he will be until the end of the world it's not time to dwell on the impossibilities it's not time to dwell on your failures and it's not time to question really me I'm So Unworthy I'm sure why me you know so many times he's standing there and he's offering it to you and he's right here saying take it take it and we're sitting there no no no I can't I'm not good enough I'm not listen we know you're not good enough get in line behind the rest of us unworthy people and you say I know I'm not good enough but I accept it I'll take it it's a free gift it's your favor it's your love it's your blessings I recognize my own worthiness but in accepting this I'm recognizing his worthiness he was worthy enough for my sin he was worthy enough to open the book he's worthy it's not about your worthiness it's about thou has found favor with God I'm sure Mary could have stood there for an hour explaining to the angel why she couldn't be the one but he's looking for people who will say be it unto me just be it unto me Lord I accept it I accepted why do we argue with God I just want to ask you if somebody showed up at your house tomorrow with 10 million dollars would you tell them you weren't worthy of it I you know I really didn't do anything to deserve this money I I really didn't earn it there's probably others who deserve this more than I do who asked you they just said here and there's where he's at tonight going you found favor do you accept it do you take the grace and mercy of almighty God do you accept that I send a message to call you but but what about the others I sent a message to call you you found my favor you found Grace do you accept it do you respond to it tonight and say be it unto me Lord Lord I accept it I'm unworthy but I accept it I accept the blood I accept the token I wanted to infiltrate my life I may not be deserving but you were worthy and I accept it tonight I'm not going to argue with you anymore I accept the favor of almighty God [Applause] he says Hail Mary blessed art thou among women thou has found favor with God brother Branham says oh Church hell blessed are you among the people for you found favor with God you've believed for eternal life and God's given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] we just got to receive what he's trying to give us tonight if we're going to produce all that the word says that we're supposed to produce we must respond to God's favor the same way that Mary responded to it we got to move Beyond self-pity we got to move Beyond woe is me and step two be it unto me they sound similar but there's a we got too many woe as me people always down in the dump I call them eeyors I'm sorry I've seen Winnie the Pooh Eeyore nobody loves me it's a terrible day God probably doesn't care about me and they go through their whole life that way listen I think we need to be a little bit more like that tiger in there what's his name Tigger always bouncing around and full of joy and full of happiness because we recognize not woe is me but be it unto me there's joy in my step there's overcoming in my life I got reason to be happy you make it you can be sad all you want but I know I'm going to heaven I'm going in a Rapture I'm going in a body change I got a reason to be happy and full of mine it was a bad day at work but I'm saved it was a bad seed went out at home but I'm saved I'm going through a horrible trial but I have favor with God and I've got reason to Rejoice tonight Hallelujah his love is elective it doesn't mean you're not going to go through trials but his love is proven because he called you and he died for you and it secured an election tonight God loves you you have found favor with almighty God Hallelujah you know six months before this visitation to Mary Gabriel visited Zacharias at the temple Luke 1 and 5. he says there was in the days of Herod the King of Judea a certain priest named Zachariah of the course of ABIA and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth and they were both righteous before God walking in all the Commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless and they had no child because that Elizabeth was Barren and they were both now well stricken in years now I want us to notice that their situation isn't near as impossible as Mary's situation because they have an example to look back to and if you look at Genesis 18 11 it almost describes the exact same situation now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women see it's been done before there we are what are you facing tonight cancer it's been healed before depression has been delivered before [Applause] prodigal sons they've been saved before just look in the word it's been done before it's all been done before there's nothing that he has not conquered just look back and see if he did it before and he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll do it again for me tonight in my situation we skip down to verse 11 of Luke 1. and there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when Zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him now I figure this is a very friendly tone he's telling him not to be afraid so he's not being rough he says fear not Zechariah for thy prayer notice thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord now if you're not quite picking this up it's a pretty big deal that's pretty big deal this is a pretty awesome thing that's just happened listen Zacharias is about to shout he's about to declare the glories of God he's about to get loose in the spirit and run around testifying about the power of God I mean what a message to just come to him you've been praying for this child oh Zachariah your prayers have been heard and not only are y'all going to have a son but he's going to be great in the sight of the Lord many are going to turn to God because of him and he's going to be the Forerunner how incredible this is and you just expect a wonderful celebration of praise in verse 18 and Zechariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know this for I am an old man and my wife is well stricken in years are we are we expecting to receive the things we pray for or are we just praying are we actually looking for the Fulfillment of it can we accept it when the word says that you're healed can we accept it when the word says that the promise is unto you well I don't know there's so many do we even believe what we're praying for God the angel said this is your prayer I'm here because you asked and now you don't know if you can accept this or not one Bible scholar describes it like this he said this was not a humble petition for the confirming of his faith but a peevish objection against what was said to him as altogether incredible as if he would have said I can never be made to believe this I can never be made to believe this now we go to verse 19 and I I believe that the tone of the Angel changes a little bit I don't think we're in Friendly tones anymore and the angel answering unto him said I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these Glad Tidings and behold Thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believeth not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season listen because of this doubt God said strike him dumb because I got a little virgin down there that I'm about to visit and I don't need you spreading your doubt and your unbelief and your fears and your worry because I got a little virgin down there that's going to say being unto me I think it's time that the mouth of the unbeliever just gets shut up quit spreading your doubt in your worry and your fear and your negative confession and just say yes I don't know how it's gonna happen but yes Lord it's gonna happen there will be a pride there will be a Rapture that will be a church without spot a wrinkle yes yes yes yes yes yes so he has his mouth shut up so that the unbelief can't be spread now I want you to notice something back in verse 34. this is different what he said from Mary asking how will this be if we look back in verse 34. because I I gotta be honest with you I'm an open book sometimes it's too open but I know where brother Brandon said Mary never ask a question she never doubted he said she she never doubted she never questioned but then I see and I read the verse and it says how shall this be and I'm like I don't know it's just there is a question mark there that's all I'm saying I'm just saying I see a question mark it looks like a question but as you begin to read into it and study it and break it down it's simply her saying okay the Messiah is to be virgin born and I'm going to be that virgin will you share with me how you're going to do it in other words it's actually her just asking for more instruction if you get into it it's actually no different than the preacher up here and he begins to preach and he gets under the anointing and you like what you're hearing so you're on the edge of your seat and you're going amen tell me a little bit more tell me a little bit more about this Rapture tell me a little bit more about this body change tell me a little bit more about this message I believe it I just want to hear a little bit more and she's not saying how's this going to be she's saying tell me more about it tell me about Isaac I want to know about my bridegroom tell me about heaven tell me about the Pearly Gates tell me about justification tell me about the Holy Ghost she's just wanting to hear more she's just wanting to hear more tell me more and what's wonderful about it is the answer that Gabriel gives her fully satisfies her he says in verse 35 and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing that which shall be born of Thee he shall be shall be called the son of God and once she's told that it's going to be done by the power of the Holy Ghost that's suffices she says be it unto me oh I know the Holy Ghost can change my situation tonight I know the Holy Ghost can move in my home yes just be it home to me I know he can change me he'll ranked sinner I know he can give me the Holy Ghost I know he can bring my children back I know he could just be it unto me Lord oh how's this going to happen the power of the Holy Ghost Okay I accept it be it unto me I don't know how I'm gonna do it the power of the Holy Ghost okay be it unto me how am I ever gonna make it because you have a promise you have his favor and it's going to be done by the power of the Holy Ghost okay Lord I accept it be it unto me Lord Jesus just be it unto me Hallelujah if we can just take that recipe tonight that you got a promise you got his favor and it's going to be done by the power of the Holy Ghost there's nothing there's nothing that you can't overcome listen there I'm not Gabriel and I didn't step out of the pillar of fire tonight right here before your eyes but God did lay it on my heart to bring a message to you and tell you thou Hast found favor with God thou Hast found favor with God and God is with thee every step of the way and the way you're going to make it is through the power of the Holy Ghost the way you're going to overcome is the power of the Holy Ghost the way we're going to Rapture the way we're going to be healed the way we're going to be delivered the way your child's coming home the way it's all going to wrap up in absolute perfection how by the power of the Holy Ghost thou has found favor with almighty God tonight how are you going to respond to it how are you going to respond to it is there anybody here that'll say be it unto me Lord be it unto me Lord Jesus I accept your favor I accept your forgiveness I accept all that you've done to me be it unto me Lord Jesus Word of Life thou has found favor will you stand together with me tonight Hallelujah Hallelujah you have found favor with God and he has heard your prayers and he has come down you've been praying for healing and healing is here you've been praying for deliverance and deliverance is here you've been seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's here to give it to you you've been asking for the impossible then he says watch me do it and once you recognize that you have favor no trial matters no hardship listen you don't think that Mary knew in her mind the hardship she was about to go through and she went around telling people I'm pregnant but she knew the mocking and the ridicule they're going to want to Stone me they're going to want to kill me for they're going to do this and they're going to think that I'm going to be an outcast the rest of my life and she weighed that up against his favor and she said be it unto me I'll take whatever the world wants to throw at me I'll be ridiculed I'll be outcast but Lord Jesus just let me have your favor just let me know that you're with me wherever I go just let me know that the power of the Holy Ghost is walking before me is that does that mean we won't have trials does that mean no he doesn't mean that it just means that you have his favor and he's right there with you and he's going to see you through to the other side listen I know life hurts I know there's scars and there's heartaches and there's wounds and there's real things and he comes and the devil tries to bury you under all those things and begin to tell you you're going through this because you messed up you're going through this because God doesn't love you anymore and brother Branham comes and he says that the cloudy skies and the storms of life are no sign of God's disapproval job never lost God's approval as a matter of fact job had God's favor in his life and brother Branham goes on to say that when you go through a trial and you go through a hardship it proves that you found favor with God because he chose you to beat this devil he chose you to win this trial and I want to tell you tonight the trial that you're in was not sent that it might rule over your life but you were said that you might rule over that trial you were said that you could so he's the same yesterday today and forever that God's A Healer that goes to deliver that God's a savior that trial in your life is manifesting the very works of Christ once again in the closing moments of time within time conditions all around us God says hell Church thou Hast found favor with God God bless you tonight we love you in the love of the Lord [Applause] Hallelujah and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called Son of God the prophet goes on to say that anybody knows the body of God is not yet finished but it's being finished as it's being born in US the word of this day wants to be born In You and I so we've been told that we've found a favor now he's waiting on our response so what will be our response we found favor in his eyes were loved he thought of us before the foundation of the world when there was no stars there was no atoms no molecules were light but he thought of you and he wants you to know that he loves you so what's your response going to be well I'll I'll have to think about it I mean I don't know if I could be able to but that's not Mary's response be it unto me according to that word be it unto me and he believes he is the same do we or not do we believe he's the same we saw him right here Sunday perform several healings and you only saw part of it you see part of it kept on going on back in the office after church it kept on going God was moving for more back there preachers as a matter of fact the Lord touched brother Joel back there the Lord touched by the Chisholm back there Hallelujah there was a sister here from Brother Jules Church and whenever she heard me referred to Brother Brad Gilbert getting his eyes healed Sunday a week ago she heard that and instantly the Lord touched her eyes and healed and then be it unto me Lord according to Thy Word now you know preachers came to that all I said was Lord Heal sugar diabetes okay I'll say it again Lord your sugar diabetes Lord Heal sugar diabetes it won't do any good just for me to repeat those words but it's when we take him at his word and then that something connects with us as an individual and God drops it in your heart how many has a need to know Hallelujah maybe you've got a circumstance or an event that you can't find a scripture for or quote for don't worry God still got you covered as our brothers so beautifully said Mary didn't have any example to be able to refer to she believed it the woman with issue of blood she had no reference that she could point back to now God can do this because he did it forward had never done it no record of it but somehow she believed it how is that possible since she didn't have any Scripture to base it on how is that possible that she didn't have any history to base it on but she had a need the sorrow Phoenician Woman Jesus called her a dog treated her mad talked to her racial terms racial slurs or to be categorized today but she had the kind of faith that Jesus himself couldn't even run her off I believe that's the way the bride is people saying that Old Devil oh they want that old devil and people talk about me at the church and people you mean that's as close to God as you are you'll let people knock you out you'll let the devil knock you out you're really going to be hurting when you meet God Jacob didn't meet the devil on the bank Jacob didn't meet a fallen angel he met almighty God and almighty God was trying to wrestle him out of getting what he wanted he said I'm telling you God I'm going to hurt you I'm going to hurt you I'm here to be changed I need help I'm tired of being Jacob I'm here to be changed that's the kind of faith praise the Lord it's about our heads right now let's let's hold our needs our desires our requests not only here in the visible audience but those of you that are home streaming Wherever You Are Heavenly Father we believe what you have laid upon our brother's heart for us tonight I believe that you gave him this for us a sermon that was made especially for Word of Life Church to tell us that we found favor in your eyes what else could we ask for that would be any greater to know that we have found favor in your eyes and your presence as you're with us to bring to pass the purpose of that favor Mary found favor but for a reason so it wasn't like she just found favor and oh okay well okay I found favor in his eyes she found favor to fulfill we believe we have found favor to Hallelujah Hallelujah to fulfill the words spoken of us Lord your Prophet tells us the same word that spoke of the groom also speaks of the Bride Lord God you say our desires you see our reasons for being here on the earth is to serve you we're not here to build a kingdom we're not here father that people might look at us and think that we are something Lord Mary's name has been heralded for thousands of years because she submitted to the charge of the angel but Mary was herself nothing nobody yet Lord God she found favor in your eyes so we've already established that our brother's done a beautiful job with it tonight so why should we spend the rest of the time trying to re-establish we don't deserve it in the first place we say that right up front but you have called us Lord so it's not our worthiness it's yours now as we pray together I'm asking you in the name of Jesus you'd pass by this way to my father hallelujah hallelujah Lord God would you bring healing would you bring Deliverance
