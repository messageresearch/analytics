[48:23] chains and

[50:40] truly a
[50:41] miracle we're so thankful that we've
[50:44] been given these few days together in
[50:46] the presence of the Lord
[50:48] and there's something about the saints
[50:50] of God coming together each one of us
[50:53] that have the Holy Ghost at that little
[50:55] lick of fire and when we come together
[50:57] it's just amazing and I think what will
[51:00] it be like that
[51:02] day when we all gather around his
[51:06] throne we have no time clock we have no
[51:09] big ones no little ones everybody just
[51:13] there before the Throne of God for
[51:15] eternity that'll be a time on
[51:17] it amen we so enjoyed the ministry of
[51:20] the word and all the effort that's been
[51:23] put forth by everyone the local Saints
[51:26] that's made so much of this possible we
[51:28] want to say thank you for the
[51:30] ministering Brothers brother Josh and
[51:32] brother Andrew certainly appreciate them
[51:35] but we also appreciate your part because
[51:38] you are a great impact and a great
[51:41] deposit on how each service turns out
[51:44] whether it's in your home church or in a
[51:46] special meeting like this we thank you
[51:50] those of you that'll be going back home
[51:52] today tomorrow whenever be sure and
[51:54] greet your pastors for us and thank them
[51:57] for feeling that they could trust you to
[52:00] be able to come here in this day and age
[52:02] you want your sheep to be able to go
[52:04] somewhere where they'd be blessed and
[52:06] you know there's so much stuff going
[52:08] around but we're just thankful that you
[52:10] could come and be with us and share
[52:12] these days with us let's just open our

[52:44] sermon for all these hundreds and
[52:46] hundreds of people that are here and

[58:53] to you this morning let's just let's
[58:54] just go to the Lord here let's read his
[58:56] word this morning Revelations chap 10
[58:59] and verse one and I saw another Mighty
[59:02] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[59:06] a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[59:09] and his face was as it were of the Sun
[59:13] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[59:16] had in his hand a little book open and
[59:18] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[59:20] his left foot on the earth and cried
[59:22] with a loud voice as when a lion Roth
[59:25] and when and he had cried seven Thunders
[59:28] had uttered their voices let's go down
[59:31] to verse 7 but in the days of the voice
[59:33] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[59:36] to sound the mystery of God should be
[59:38] finished as Heath declared to his
[59:40] servants the prophets and the voice
[59:42] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[59:44] again and said go and take the little
[59:46] book which is open in the hand of the
[59:48] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[59:51] upon the Earth and I went unto the angel
[59:53] and said unto him give me the little
[59:55] book and he said said unto me take it
[59:57] and eat it and it shall make thy belly
[59:59] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[1:00:01] sweet as honey and I took the little
[1:00:04] book out of the Angel's hand and ate it
[1:00:07] up notice there's things that the word
[1:00:10] does to you but notice where the word is
[1:00:12] it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:00:16] soon as I'd eaten my my belly was bitter
[1:00:19] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:00:21] again before many peoples and Nations
[1:00:24] and tongues also du to onomy Chapter 30
[1:00:28] and verse
[1:00:35] 11 I'm sorry to keep you standing
[1:00:39] and but I'll be standing just a minute
[1:00:41] here this morning I'm sure love hearing
[1:00:44] hearing the pages of those Bibles
[1:00:48] amen verse 11 for this commandment which
[1:00:51] I command thee this day is not hidden
[1:00:53] from the neither is it far off it is not
[1:00:56] in heaven that thou should as say who
[1:00:58] shall go up for us to heaven and bring
[1:01:00] it unto us that we may hear it and do it
[1:01:02] neither is it beyond the sea that thou
[1:01:05] should us say who shall go over for us
[1:01:08] over the sea for us and bring it unto us
[1:01:10] that we may hear it and do it but the
[1:01:12] word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth
[1:01:16] and in thy heart that thou mayest do it
[1:01:18] amen I'll let you be seated just just
[1:01:20] this morning also I'd like to read from
[1:01:23] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 5 even
[1:01:26] when we were dead in sins hath he
[1:01:29] quickened us you want this don't
[1:01:33] you oh
[1:01:36] well he just wants my
[1:01:39] jacket even when we were dead in sins
[1:01:42] hath he quickened us together with
[1:01:44] Christ by grace are you saved and hath
[1:01:48] raised us up together and made us to sit
[1:01:51] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:01:54] Jesus I would like to take a thought
[1:01:56] this morning from this context that
[1:01:59] we've just read here this morning on
[1:02:01] positionally placed by the mighty Angel
[1:02:04] positionally placed by the mighty Angel
[1:02:06] we realize where we are living at here
[1:02:08] in the closing hours of the Church of
[1:02:11] the Living God we realize that we're in
[1:02:12] very pivotable moments when we begin to
[1:02:14] watch the scenes of the demographics of
[1:02:17] the the the politics of the world and
[1:02:20] then you begin to watch the wars that
[1:02:21] are happening in in Israel and Iran and
[1:02:24] then you begin to watch the wars between
[1:02:26] Russia Russia and Ukraine and we
[1:02:29] recognize that it's demon powers that
[1:02:31] are aligning themselves and they're
[1:02:33] getting themselves imp position and we
[1:02:35] recognize that when when brother Brandon
[1:02:37] would come and he would preach the
[1:02:38] recognizing day in its message he said
[1:02:40] now National Force did not National
[1:02:42] Force he said it put Israel in her
[1:02:45] Homeland he said National Force will put
[1:02:47] the put the church in the world Council
[1:02:49] of churches he said but it'll be the
[1:02:51] power of God that will put the people in
[1:02:54] The Bride he said the world for forces
[1:02:56] this way and the world forces that way
[1:02:58] he said but God forces upward he said
[1:03:00] the spirit of God which is the word of
[1:03:02] God my word is spirit and life will put
[1:03:05] the bride in her place cuz she'll
[1:03:08] recognize her position in the word then
[1:03:10] she's in Christ will put her in place
[1:03:14] and that's exactly what the message of
[1:03:15] the hour has done for us as a Church of
[1:03:18] the Living God we recognize that it has
[1:03:21] it has placed us in a position that only
[1:03:24] the word of God would do when brother
[1:03:26] Brandon would tell us in Christ The
[1:03:27] Mystery of God reveal he said this whole
[1:03:29] thing he said the whole thing is a
[1:03:31] revelation to God to take Eve back to
[1:03:34] her right position again with her
[1:03:37] husband and to think the things that you
[1:03:39] have seen and the things that you have
[1:03:41] handled that you recognize that this has
[1:03:44] been about placing you in the hour of
[1:03:46] adoption that he has placed you as Sons
[1:03:49] and Daughters of God he's placed you in
[1:03:51] the economy of God he's placed you right
[1:03:54] here he's not given you a close book but
[1:03:56] he's given you an open book and that
[1:03:58] book that is open it has the power to
[1:04:01] defeat anything that the word of God
[1:04:03] comes up against and I'm so thankful to
[1:04:05] know that we're not facing an enemy
[1:04:07] today with a closed book but we are
[1:04:09] facing an enemy with every every shackle
[1:04:12] and every every tradition and everything
[1:04:15] broke off the word of God so that we can
[1:04:17] recognize that we are a body move that
[1:04:20] is fully liberated by the very power of
[1:04:22] almighty God he didn't just come and
[1:04:24] give liberation to William brandom but
[1:04:27] he came and gave a liberating power to
[1:04:29] the Church of the Living God so that she
[1:04:31] would recognize her position in him
[1:04:33] because we recognize without him that we
[1:04:36] are absolutely nothing is that right
[1:04:39] we're nothing here this morning without
[1:04:41] the King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[1:04:43] but I believe that it's one of the most
[1:04:45] key and pivotable things that that the
[1:04:47] message has done that it it it one of
[1:04:49] the key features is that it has placed a
[1:04:52] bride in her position I also believe
[1:04:54] that it's one of the Great tactics that
[1:04:57] the enemy has against the Church of the
[1:04:58] Living God is to take away her identity
[1:05:02] of recognizing who she is in Christ
[1:05:05] Jesus and we recognize that it's it's
[1:05:07] God's greatest thing but it's Satan's
[1:05:09] greatest thing is that he's wanting to
[1:05:11] steal away the identity from the Church
[1:05:14] of the Living God to allow spiritual
[1:05:16] Amnesia to fall upon Sons and Daughters
[1:05:18] of God that they'll fail to recognize
[1:05:21] who they are in the body move because
[1:05:23] it's not just about a preacher it's not
[1:05:26] just about deacons it's not just about
[1:05:28] the daddies and The Mamas it's about
[1:05:29] young boys and young girls and I believe
[1:05:32] that if we're going to stand for
[1:05:33] anything we ought to stand for what the
[1:05:35] message has given unto us in this
[1:05:37] generation now we recognize that if
[1:05:39] Satan's going to steal our identity then
[1:05:41] it's one thing that we ought to stand up
[1:05:43] for is our identity in Jesus Christ
[1:05:47] because we recognize that is exactly
[1:05:49] what Satan or what the enemy did to
[1:05:52] Legion when he came unto him what did he
[1:05:54] do he stole his identity away from him
[1:05:57] what did it do it displaced him it
[1:06:00] robbed him of his dress wear and you
[1:06:02] watch what is happening today that is
[1:06:04] the same thing that Satan is trying to
[1:06:06] do to the church he's trying to rob her
[1:06:09] of Ephesians 4 And1 he's trying to rob
[1:06:12] her of her dress wear and what did he do
[1:06:14] Satan scarred him but what did the word
[1:06:17] of God do when it came when it came past
[1:06:20] legion's way it placed him back in a
[1:06:22] position and the next spot you see
[1:06:25] Legion one spot you see him chained one
[1:06:27] spot you see him in this condition but
[1:06:29] the next spot you see him standing
[1:06:32] before the word of God Unchained dressed
[1:06:35] in his righte ropes and I'll tell you
[1:06:37] that's one thing that the chief mechanic
[1:06:39] has done in this generation he designed
[1:06:42] a body that sets itself under the word
[1:06:44] of God he knows what it's going to take
[1:06:47] to put a church in rapturing order
[1:06:49] because he designed it that
[1:06:51] way he can provide himself a church
[1:06:54] because he still Jehovah Gyra he can
[1:06:57] provide himself a body because he's
[1:06:58] still Jehovah Shalom he will provide
[1:07:02] himself a body that will be without spot
[1:07:04] that will be without wrinkles she'll be
[1:07:06] a glorious bride she'll be a super
[1:07:08] Church a super seed a bride without a
[1:07:11] spot a bride without wrinkle a body that
[1:07:14] knows who she is a body that knows what
[1:07:16] she's called for
[1:07:18] Hallelujah you know what you called for
[1:07:21] it's just like when Joshua was placed
[1:07:24] under his Commission to stand there and
[1:07:26] go in there and possess all the land
[1:07:28] that he was promised we recognize that
[1:07:31] it was Moses's it was Moses's commission
[1:07:34] to preach the word but it was Joshua's
[1:07:36] commission to go in there and to divide
[1:07:38] to divide the inheritance that was
[1:07:40] laying there and all of Joshua's
[1:07:42] commission was hinging upon believing
[1:07:45] what the message
[1:07:46] said yeah Joshua's going to have some
[1:07:49] battles yes Joshua was going to have
[1:07:51] some struggles but brother baram would
[1:07:53] say it in the absolute that Joshua was
[1:07:56] tied to an absolute and it brought about
[1:07:58] a paradox and I know that there's a lot
[1:08:01] of things that don't make sense to you
[1:08:03] how God is going to work out the details
[1:08:05] of it but we recognize that it didn't
[1:08:07] make a whole lot of sense to Joshua how
[1:08:09] we would cross the Jordan River it
[1:08:11] didn't make a whole lot of sense to him
[1:08:13] how he was going to go in there and tear
[1:08:15] down Jericho it didn't make a whole lot
[1:08:17] of sense when he stood there and he told
[1:08:19] the son to stand still but that's the
[1:08:21] thing about a Son of God he's got
[1:08:23] another sense that don't make sense to
[1:08:25] the rest of the world and it's a key of
[1:08:27] faith that opens every door and William
[1:08:30] brandham would say this he said
[1:08:32] everything that God has for you if
[1:08:34] you'll lay a hold of it it's God's giv
[1:08:37] promise to
[1:08:38] you it's God's giv promise to you he
[1:08:41] said every place that The Souls of your
[1:08:43] foot shall tread upon that have I given
[1:08:45] unto you and it don't make a whole lot
[1:08:47] of sense why you would believe in a body
[1:08:49] change but it don't have to make sense
[1:08:52] to you because God's got a perfect sense
[1:08:54] he's got a perfect word that'll put you
[1:08:57] in a perfect rapturing order in a
[1:08:59] condition that only Sons and Daughters
[1:09:01] of God can know
[1:09:04] about it didn't make a whole lot of
[1:09:06] sense because Joshua had a revelation
[1:09:09] because the Bible said in Deuteronomy 29
[1:09:12] and 29 the secret things belong unto the
[1:09:14] Lord but the things which are revealed
[1:09:17] belong unto us so what are you talking
[1:09:20] about brother angrew I'm talking about
[1:09:22] your belongings I'm talking about
[1:09:24] something that person
[1:09:25] belongs to you that the devil can't
[1:09:28] steal from you because Joshua wasn't
[1:09:30] just looking over there and seeing
[1:09:32] Giants in that land he wasn't just
[1:09:34] looking over there and seeing walls in
[1:09:36] that land or rivers to cross or natural
[1:09:39] things but Joshua was looking by a
[1:09:42] natural or a supernatural sense and he
[1:09:44] looked over there and he saw miracles in
[1:09:46] that land he saw blessings in that land
[1:09:49] he saw Deliverance in that land he saw
[1:09:52] young people that would be born in that
[1:09:54] land and would grow up under the
[1:09:56] citizenship of a Joshua
[1:09:59] commission I'll tell you this it's more
[1:10:02] than just Giants in our way it's more
[1:10:04] than just troubles in our way there's a
[1:10:07] future home for the Church of the Living
[1:10:09] God there's leadership there's an
[1:10:12] invisible Union there's modern events
[1:10:14] made clear by prophecy and somebody's
[1:10:17] going to lay a hold of it there may be a
[1:10:19] whole lot of this generation that don't
[1:10:21] want to rise up and accept but I'll say
[1:10:23] that everything that the seven and
[1:10:25] church ages have longed for is within
[1:10:28] the graps of the Church of the Living
[1:10:30] God we're right here on the cusp of a
[1:10:33] body change and I believe that if we're
[1:10:35] going to do anything we have to lay a
[1:10:38] hold of all of the word of
[1:10:41] God hallelujah what is it Faith's going
[1:10:44] to unlock the door to let you into it
[1:10:47] now we recognize this
[1:10:49] that this message that we we follow
[1:10:52] aren't you thankful to be following the
[1:10:54] message
[1:10:55] we know that this message that we're
[1:10:57] following it didn't come from the mind
[1:11:00] of a hillbilly Ki and that had poor
[1:11:02] grammar that only had a seventh grade
[1:11:05] education and I'm not just pointing out
[1:11:07] the lack of of William brandom's
[1:11:09] education to belittle the man but you
[1:11:10] know that if you study the message this
[1:11:13] didn't come from a William brandom that
[1:11:14] had a seventh grade education but this
[1:11:16] literally came from a higher
[1:11:18] intelligence one that could sit there
[1:11:20] and could Point him to the scriptures
[1:11:22] and could take him and direct him
[1:11:24] through the word because you know that
[1:11:26] if you study out the seals that William
[1:11:27] Brandon would say he said now if it
[1:11:29] wasn't for the angel of the Lord that
[1:11:30] would come in my room about midday today
[1:11:33] he said I would have made a horrible
[1:11:34] mistake so there was somebody that was
[1:11:36] standing close to our Prophet that was
[1:11:39] literally leading him through the
[1:11:40] scriptures and pointing out Revelations
[1:11:43] he was pointing out the borders for
[1:11:45] Joshua so that he could understand
[1:11:47] that's why when William brandham comes
[1:11:49] and preach the Feast of the trumpets
[1:11:51] what does he do to the Church of the
[1:11:52] Living God he literally lines out the
[1:11:54] board ERS for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:57] what is it it's exactly what William
[1:11:59] Brandon would preach in the spoken word
[1:12:02] is the Original Seed he would stand
[1:12:04] there and he would tell us he would tell
[1:12:05] us he said now he said that germ life
[1:12:08] has got to come through the body it's
[1:12:10] got to come through the body he said but
[1:12:12] the angel was directing Phillip down
[1:12:14] there to that unic but the germ of Life
[1:12:16] couldn't come through that angel it had
[1:12:19] to come through the body of Jesus Christ
[1:12:22] we recognize that there was an Angelic
[1:12:24] being that was standing at the pulpit
[1:12:26] night after night telling people their
[1:12:28] diseases that would give them their
[1:12:30] addresses and tell them of their past
[1:12:33] but it would also foretell them of their
[1:12:35] future when William Bram is standing
[1:12:37] there across Seas he's standing there
[1:12:40] and you remember when brother brandom he
[1:12:41] starts talking about that that man that
[1:12:43] was cross-eyed and the doctor came to
[1:12:45] him and said you performed hypnotism on
[1:12:47] him he said oh no I didn't he said if
[1:12:49] that's the case he said then you doctors
[1:12:51] need to start performing hypnotism he
[1:12:53] said all I can tell you is that there
[1:12:55] was a being that was standing between me
[1:12:58] and the crosy boy and when he touched
[1:13:01] that or that being touched that boy his
[1:13:03] eyes come cross they come completely
[1:13:06] straight that's what's happening to the
[1:13:07] Church of the Living God she don't have
[1:13:09] her eyes on Le osia and her eyes on the
[1:13:12] word but she's had her eyes fixed by the
[1:13:15] angel of the Covenant and he's here to
[1:13:17] make sure that he gotes you through the
[1:13:19] land he guides you through the property
[1:13:21] he can take you through Isaiah 53 he can
[1:13:24] take you through Joel 28 he can take you
[1:13:26] through it all and he ain't going to
[1:13:28] lead you wrong but he'll lead you right
[1:13:30] to your
[1:13:33] position that's what William Brandon
[1:13:35] would say he said a word born bride what
[1:13:38] is it he said that end time prophecies
[1:13:40] will repeat I believe as the first
[1:13:42] Forerunner come from the Wilderness and
[1:13:44] cried Behold the Lamb of God he said the
[1:13:46] second Forerunner will probably do the
[1:13:49] same by pointing the people to a word
[1:13:51] born bride he said the Bride of Jesus
[1:13:54] will be pointed towards the skies at the
[1:13:57] appearing of Jesus Christ ain't it
[1:13:58] wonderful to know that there's been an
[1:14:00] angel that stood in this generation he
[1:14:03] didn't point you to defeat he didn't
[1:14:05] point you to troubles he didn't point
[1:14:07] you to L osia but he pointed you towards
[1:14:09] the
[1:14:11] sky Hallelujah we believe and know that
[1:14:14] God any of us who study the Bible we
[1:14:17] recognize that God has has got Legions
[1:14:20] of angels and that God throughout the
[1:14:22] span of time has allowed men to be able
[1:14:24] to fellowship with angels been there to
[1:14:26] stand there and see them so I I believe
[1:14:29] that you're message people here so you
[1:14:31] understand what exactly what I'm talking
[1:14:32] about is that there there were angels
[1:14:35] and men were allowed to see them men
[1:14:37] were allowed to feel the effect and
[1:14:39] influence of that Heavenly realm and but
[1:14:42] when you see an angel in the Bible it
[1:14:44] shows us that it's a sign that there's a
[1:14:47] junction at hand and every time that you
[1:14:49] would watch when your brother William
[1:14:50] Randon would preach on on the junction
[1:14:52] of time he would stand there he said
[1:14:54] things happen when when at a junction he
[1:14:57] said it's a Crossroads Angels appear
[1:15:00] prophets arise and the miraculous is
[1:15:02] done at a junction of time so when we
[1:15:06] watched in this generation when an angel
[1:15:08] would come here and lead us through the
[1:15:10] Scriptures it was a sign to us that the
[1:15:13] miraculous is at hand well brother
[1:15:15] Andrew are you talking that we're all
[1:15:17] going to walk out of here you're going
[1:15:18] to discern our life and you're going to
[1:15:20] make us all miraculously whole
[1:15:23] absolutely not I ain't got anything to
[1:15:25] do with that but I believe that that
[1:15:27] same angel that would stand there by
[1:15:29] William brandom has accompanied the body
[1:15:31] of Jesus Christ he's not left her he
[1:15:34] didn't die in 1965 but I believe with
[1:15:37] all of my heart that there's a healing
[1:15:39] angel that is still with the Church of
[1:15:42] the Living God you feel the influence of
[1:15:44] them every once in a while what is it
[1:15:47] when you begin to worship and break into
[1:15:48] a praise that doesn't make sense to you
[1:15:51] what is it William Brandon would say
[1:15:53] you're bumping into an angs you'll start
[1:15:56] crying you'll start rejoicing you'll
[1:15:58] start weeping you don't understand what
[1:16:00] it is but you're bumping in to another
[1:16:03] world I don't want to just shout I don't
[1:16:06] want to just scream I don't just want to
[1:16:08] enjoy myself here but I want to bump
[1:16:11] into an angel that changes my
[1:16:14] body I want to bump into an angel that
[1:16:17] has the power to rid Ron Spencer of all
[1:16:21] of his problems and you of your problems
[1:16:24] and I believe
[1:16:25] if you can praise the Living
[1:16:29] God there's an angel in this place this
[1:16:32] morning and his name is Jesus Christ
[1:16:35] he's here to lead the Church of the
[1:16:37] Living
[1:16:37] [Applause]
[1:16:42] God what is it it's a sign that when an
[1:16:45] angel appears that he's coming to
[1:16:47] position his Believers at that time or
[1:16:49] in that season in a position just like
[1:16:52] when he would come to Samson's mom
[1:16:55] manoah when he would come to her and
[1:16:57] speak to her you watch it you know what
[1:16:59] happened he would begin to tell her
[1:17:01] about a child that she had not had yet
[1:17:04] but he was born to be a deliverer and
[1:17:06] the angel positioned Samson's mom and
[1:17:09] dad in a position that they would
[1:17:12] recognize that the supernatural was
[1:17:15] getting ready to take
[1:17:17] place and brother Ram would say in the
[1:17:19] message expectations and what love is he
[1:17:23] said now father may you just take over
[1:17:25] from right now and anoint the building
[1:17:28] he said we dedicate it to you just now
[1:17:30] he said May the angels of heaven come
[1:17:33] down through the ladder off the ladder
[1:17:35] of Jacob and take their positions now as
[1:17:38] soldiers at their post of Duty setting
[1:17:40] every place every corner every place and
[1:17:43] take their right positions and may they
[1:17:46] not leave this building until this
[1:17:48] revival is over I pray that you not
[1:17:51] leave your position I pray that you not
[1:17:54] get out of your position because God has
[1:17:56] got Angels at their position and I pray
[1:17:58] that you young people don't leave here
[1:18:00] without your deliverance don't leave
[1:18:02] here without your breakthrough don't
[1:18:04] leave here without an assurance knowing
[1:18:06] that you're going to make it because
[1:18:08] angels are at their position and it's a
[1:18:10] sign to you that you have to come to
[1:18:12] your position and rise to it because
[1:18:15] there are angels of God that are in the
[1:18:17] room and they are here what is it they
[1:18:19] are here with a purpose in mind to draw
[1:18:22] you into his presence now you watch when
[1:18:25] William Brandon would talk about he
[1:18:27] would talk about demonology and he would
[1:18:28] talk about he would you would hear him
[1:18:30] on tape on time he would talk about how
[1:18:32] that there was somebody that was getting
[1:18:33] ready to get a blessing and all of a
[1:18:35] sudden they stood up and went to the
[1:18:36] bathroom he said it was an evil spirit
[1:18:38] that led them out now if an evil spirit
[1:18:41] can make you do that how much more can a
[1:18:43] holy spirit how much more can a god of
[1:18:46] mercy and Grace come leading a word of
[1:18:49] God by your way if an evil spirit's got
[1:18:51] the power to make you rise up out of
[1:18:53] your position and walk out of the word
[1:18:55] surely there's a power here that would
[1:18:58] anoint you to come run to your position
[1:19:00] and take your
[1:19:03] position it's just like when when the
[1:19:05] angel appeared to Zacharias when he was
[1:19:08] there he was a just man he was a holy
[1:19:09] man but yet he was up there and he'd
[1:19:11] been praying about having a son all of
[1:19:13] his days he'd got got up there in his
[1:19:15] older in his older youth at that time
[1:19:17] and he got up there and he was he was
[1:19:19] without child but he'd been praying for
[1:19:20] it and the Bible declares to us that the
[1:19:22] angel Gabriel came and appeared before
[1:19:25] him and there he be to deny what he had
[1:19:28] been praying for he couldn't believe
[1:19:29] that it was going to happen when he had
[1:19:31] all of them examples throughout the Old
[1:19:33] Testament and how God did it but yet he
[1:19:36] began to begin to doubt what the angel
[1:19:39] was talking to
[1:19:42] him I want you to notice what brother
[1:19:44] maram said here he said now notice he
[1:19:46] prayed all this time and God was
[1:19:49] answering his prayer and he said I say
[1:19:51] this here he said God will answer every
[1:19:54] sincere pray prayer in his own way it
[1:19:56] may not come the way that you expect it
[1:19:58] but he will answer every sincere prayer
[1:20:01] in the in his own way what was it John
[1:20:04] the Baptist's parents they were
[1:20:07] literally being placed by the angel
[1:20:09] Gabriel into a position that they would
[1:20:12] recognize that there was a prophet on
[1:20:14] the scene it was a signal every single
[1:20:17] time that you see the angel Gabriel show
[1:20:19] up it's a signal to Israel and it's a
[1:20:22] signal to the Believers that God is is
[1:20:24] getting ready to do the miraculous and
[1:20:27] brother Brandon would say in Jehovah of
[1:20:28] Miracles he said if you want angels to
[1:20:30] appear to you keep your mind on God and
[1:20:33] off of the things of the world he said
[1:20:35] go about your business go to your church
[1:20:37] go to your washing of your dishes
[1:20:39] wherever you are keep your mind on him
[1:20:41] all day all night all day then God would
[1:20:44] do something he said you're drawing
[1:20:46] close to him you've got the world shut
[1:20:48] out just you and he in there together
[1:20:51] that's exactly what Mary was doing that
[1:20:53] morning when when she was out there
[1:20:55] walking she had done been talking to
[1:20:57] Joseph about the scriptures and there
[1:20:59] she was she had her mind on God she was
[1:21:02] thinking about God and then the angel
[1:21:04] appears to her what did it do it placed
[1:21:06] Mary in a position to produce the
[1:21:11] supernatural let me tell you this was
[1:21:13] more than a man that met her while she
[1:21:15] was walking down the street this was an
[1:21:17] Angelic being that placed her in
[1:21:20] position and I I want to announce to you
[1:21:23] that the angel is here to put you in
[1:21:25] position for the
[1:21:29] supernatural every time that an angel is
[1:21:31] shown up in the Bible when you look at
[1:21:34] it at the brass serpent when Moses would
[1:21:36] would he would he would build the brass
[1:21:38] serpent what did it do when the people
[1:21:40] would come there when they had been
[1:21:42] bitten by those snakes all they had to
[1:21:44] do was look on that brass Serpent and
[1:21:47] they looked and live but it wasn't
[1:21:49] nothing to do with a brass serpent it
[1:21:51] wasn't nothing to do their healing did
[1:21:52] not come from that brass serpent it
[1:21:54] represented judgment but there the Bible
[1:21:57] is is very clear on this is that there
[1:21:59] was an angel that was on that brass
[1:22:01] Serpent and when they looked on that
[1:22:03] angel they received their healing just
[1:22:05] like when they were there at the pool of
[1:22:07] Bethesda and they said if we'll go by if
[1:22:10] we're the very first one in the water at
[1:22:12] a certain season when the angel troubles
[1:22:15] the water then I'm made whole at that
[1:22:17] time and men after years after years had
[1:22:20] tried to get into the water but there
[1:22:21] laid a man there there laid a man there
[1:22:24] for 30 8 years with an infirmity in his
[1:22:26] life and nobody to put him in in the
[1:22:28] water and he had all kinds of excuses I
[1:22:31] couldn't get to church on time my hair
[1:22:33] wasn't done just right nobody was there
[1:22:35] to get me into church nobody and he
[1:22:37] blamed it on everybody else but when you
[1:22:40] have all of your excuses then Jesus
[1:22:43] shows up to show that he's the god
[1:22:45] that'll come by a hospital room and put
[1:22:47] you in the water I'll tell you this
[1:22:49] church you are in the season you are in
[1:22:52] the season where the angel of the Lord
[1:22:55] is troubling the waters all I've got to
[1:22:58] say to you is get in the water get in
[1:23:01] the water what is troubling Waters it's
[1:23:04] the church in her
[1:23:07] position it's a sign when you see the
[1:23:09] troubling of waters that's
[1:23:12] why that's why these meetings have such
[1:23:15] great significance because it's a sign
[1:23:17] unto us that the angel is here who draw
[1:23:21] you here it wasn't just come on
[1:23:25] it wasn't an invitation it was a holy
[1:23:28] power that led you here it was not your
[1:23:31] mama's doings it was not your church is
[1:23:33] doing there's a power that is drawing
[1:23:36] you to the power that'll change your
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:43] life what is it you're led by a
[1:23:46] supernatural being just like when elaser
[1:23:49] was looking for a wife for his son for
[1:23:52] Abraham's son Isaac brother random said
[1:23:54] that when elaser had the assurance that
[1:23:57] the angel was going before him he said
[1:23:59] then he could decide he said because he
[1:24:01] had something to back him
[1:24:03] up I'll tell you this you got something
[1:24:05] to back you up you're ambassadors of
[1:24:07] almighty God the all of Heaven is behind
[1:24:10] you and if you know this this morning if
[1:24:12] you'll reach out into a realm and just
[1:24:14] believe that all things are possible
[1:24:17] don't you get worried about if it's
[1:24:19] going to happen don't you get concerned
[1:24:21] if I raise my hand and I begin to
[1:24:23] believe on something that that that I
[1:24:25] that God will let me down God will never
[1:24:28] let you down it may not come in the way
[1:24:30] that you're expecting it but I believe
[1:24:32] that if you can reach into that realm
[1:24:34] just
[1:24:35] now where the Supernatural is you can
[1:24:38] pull out blessings you can pull out
[1:24:40] deliverances you can pull out
[1:24:42] breakthroughs you can pull out a body
[1:24:44] change you can pull out rapsure ready
[1:24:47] you can pull out a paradox you can pull
[1:24:49] out things of leadership and things of
[1:24:51] God that only you
[1:24:56] what it do brother I love this brother
[1:24:58] bam said that when eler when elaser was
[1:25:01] going down there to her kin folk what
[1:25:03] did he do he loaded up a camel for loads
[1:25:05] of blessings not for another church age
[1:25:08] not for another lady but he literally
[1:25:11] loaded up those camels for that
[1:25:13] woman do you recognize that all of this
[1:25:16] Bible has been loaded up for you every
[1:25:19] Power that you need everything you have
[1:25:21] need of all the way from Genesis all the
[1:25:23] way to Revelations he's not holding them
[1:25:25] back for another church age he's not
[1:25:27] saying that that should have been done
[1:25:28] in Luther's day he's not saying that
[1:25:30] that should have been done in Wesley's
[1:25:31] day he's not saying that that only
[1:25:33] happened in the restoration of the gifts
[1:25:35] of the body but I'm saying this unto you
[1:25:37] that you're living in the hour where the
[1:25:39] son of man and he said I'm telling you
[1:25:41] there's an angel that has gone before
[1:25:43] you these are your blessings Brothers
[1:25:45] let me tell you William brandom said
[1:25:47] every Minister has got a camel full load
[1:25:50] of blessings and we're not going to hold
[1:25:52] it back
[1:25:55] why would I stand there when I watch
[1:25:57] young girls fighting fear fighting
[1:25:59] anxiety allow them to stay in that
[1:26:01] position when I know what they have need
[1:26:04] of is right here on the camel
[1:26:07] [Applause]
[1:26:11] power it's okay this
[1:26:15] morning okay now brother random would
[1:26:18] take in
[1:26:20] 1959 question and answers he now which
[1:26:23] is it he said an angel is a servant he
[1:26:26] said' we're Sons and Daughters of God he
[1:26:28] said which is the most thought of your
[1:26:30] servant or your son or daughter his Oh
[1:26:33] my he said prayer from a saint will go a
[1:26:35] million times higher than any Angel he
[1:26:37] said because he's a
[1:26:42] son he didn't come here to place you as
[1:26:44] a servant he placed you as a
[1:26:48] son and when you can begin to recognize
[1:26:50] your position as a Son of God that your
[1:26:53] prayer goes goes higher than any angel
[1:26:55] in heaven could ever go I want you to
[1:26:57] know that when you're in that spot of
[1:26:58] prayer there are things that the angel
[1:27:01] Gabriel there are things that warmwood
[1:27:03] and all of the legions of angels have no
[1:27:05] clue about because there is something
[1:27:07] that is happening that can only happen
[1:27:09] between a son and his father and when
[1:27:12] you're in that special spot of prayer
[1:27:14] all of a sudden things begin to
[1:27:16] transform you don't Hallelujah it don't
[1:27:19] bring God down to you but it brings you
[1:27:21] up to God by the power of Prayer and
[1:27:24] I'll say exactly like William brandham
[1:27:26] said he said who's got more power an
[1:27:28] archangel in heaven or a son of God he
[1:27:31] said a Son of God has got more power
[1:27:34] than any Angel there is in heaven we
[1:27:36] seen an angel roll a stone away and we
[1:27:39] watch it AB obliterate a stone that
[1:27:41] morning on Easter morning but as Sons
[1:27:44] and Daughters of God begin to arise to
[1:27:46] their possession and in their position
[1:27:48] as manifested Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:51] William Brandon would say in the
[1:27:53] adoption series tell me Brothers has
[1:27:55] there ever been a time like this time of
[1:27:58] manifesting Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:00] it's time that nature see that you're a
[1:28:03] Son of God it's time that critics see
[1:28:05] that you're a Son of God it's time that
[1:28:07] all the world see that you're a Son of
[1:28:09] God I'm not telling you something that's
[1:28:12] far off in some other
[1:28:14] land it's right here for you he sees you
[1:28:17] he's elected you he's called you and
[1:28:20] you're not going to go down in defeat
[1:28:22] you're Rising
[1:28:27] we didn't come here to stay seated we
[1:28:30] come here to stand up like the mighty
[1:28:32] angel in Daniel 12 and in Revelations 10
[1:28:36] what was it Michael standing up and I
[1:28:39] think it's time that we match the
[1:28:41] position of the
[1:28:46] Angel if politics can take their spot if
[1:28:50] the world leaders can take their spot
[1:28:52] how much more as sons and daughters of
[1:28:54] God when the pillar of fire has not left
[1:28:56] the Church of the Living God but is
[1:28:58] right here amongst us how much more as
[1:29:00] Sons and Daughters of God should we rise
[1:29:02] to our position and personally accept
[1:29:05] everything that God's given unto us it
[1:29:07] wasn't just for Georgie
[1:29:10] Carter it wasn't just for a little fishy
[1:29:13] but it's for you as the Church of the
[1:29:14] Living
[1:29:19] God how in the world did you get in your
[1:29:22] position when you was in the of the
[1:29:24] earth when you was in a drought when it
[1:29:26] didn't look like anybody was coming by
[1:29:28] your way but an angel with a a strong
[1:29:31] hand of Mercy reached down and grabbed a
[1:29:33] hold of you and said that's not your
[1:29:35] world that's not your position that's
[1:29:38] not your place you don't have nothing to
[1:29:40] do with Le osia but you have everything
[1:29:43] to do with
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:51] heaven when Jesus was speaking
[1:29:55] with pilate before his crucifixion in
[1:29:57] John
[1:29:58] 18:36 he said my kingdom is not of this
[1:30:01] world he said if my kingdom were of this
[1:30:02] world then would my servants fight
[1:30:06] brother Bron picks that
[1:30:07] up 1949 and deity of Jesus Christ he
[1:30:11] said if my kingdom is of this world I
[1:30:14] could call many Legions of angels but my
[1:30:17] kingdom is not of this world he said but
[1:30:20] my kingdom is in heaven now notice what
[1:30:22] he says to you Church and he said the
[1:30:25] kingdom of God will be within you so
[1:30:28] therefore the legions and the powers of
[1:30:29] the backing up of the Holy Angels
[1:30:31] Allelujah is in
[1:30:34] you what Born Into You the deity of
[1:30:38] Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:41] Ghost yes sir ain't no wonder the devil
[1:30:44] in hell is so worried about you ain't no
[1:30:46] wonder he's so scared about you there's
[1:30:49] sometimes there's sometimes that you'll
[1:30:51] just get on an elevator with somebody
[1:30:53] that you don't know but there an angel a
[1:30:55] messenger that is led by God to come and
[1:30:57] bring Deliverance by your way you'll
[1:30:59] never know who you're talking to but I
[1:31:02] think it's amazing today to recognize
[1:31:05] that's the reason why all of hell is
[1:31:07] scared of your position because all of
[1:31:10] Heaven is backing me
[1:31:13] up I'm going to need some scriptures and
[1:31:16] quotes for it I'm here for you
[1:31:19] today because we recognize that when
[1:31:22] Elijah was standing up up there with his
[1:31:24] servant Gaza and Gaza was All Shook Up
[1:31:27] about the armies of Co and the armies of
[1:31:30] leosia he was shook up about all the
[1:31:32] enemies that he was seeing out there he
[1:31:35] be to look and say certain things and
[1:31:37] Elijah said Lord open up his eyes that
[1:31:40] he might see that there's more with us
[1:31:43] than there is against us and Elijah
[1:31:45] didn't see it with his own eyes but he
[1:31:47] knew Hallelujah he knew that what David
[1:31:51] had said in Psalms 34 that the angel of
[1:31:54] the Lord encampeth about them that fear
[1:31:57] him he knew what it said in Psalms 91
[1:32:00] that I will give my angels charge over
[1:32:02] thee to keep thee in the way whether you
[1:32:05] see them today or not we just want to
[1:32:08] say welcome Holy Angels I know there's
[1:32:11] more with me I know there's more with me
[1:32:14] than there is against me and it ought to
[1:32:16] give you
[1:32:21] courage I'll give you courage
[1:32:24] I'll give you courage and I give you an
[1:32:26] gumption down on the inside of your soul
[1:32:29] like buddy Robins would say Lord give me
[1:32:31] courage like the size of a log let let
[1:32:34] me stand there and let me live that kind
[1:32:36] of a life I believe that ought to give
[1:32:38] you encouragement this morning to know
[1:32:40] that the God that was with Paul is the
[1:32:42] god that is with you the God that was
[1:32:44] with William Bram is the god that is
[1:32:46] with you and he didn't send you down
[1:32:48] here so that you could fall under the
[1:32:51] demise of Satan's plans he desired find
[1:32:54] you for a Rapture and a Rapture is all
[1:32:57] you're going to
[1:32:59] take you say brother Andrew I'm I'd give
[1:33:02] myself over to this message but I'm
[1:33:07] afraid I'm afraid that it'll rob me of a
[1:33:10] good time it'll rob me of of my friends
[1:33:13] it'll rob me of my it'll rob me of my of
[1:33:16] my prestige in life I'll tell you what
[1:33:19] this message will do it'll rob you from
[1:33:21] a tribulation
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:25] it'll rob you from the Judgment it'll
[1:33:28] rob you from waking up in the middle of
[1:33:30] the night having a bad old headache
[1:33:32] wondering where you are strung out on
[1:33:34] drugs I tell you what this message will
[1:33:36] do it'll put you in a position that
[1:33:39] maybe the world might walk away from you
[1:33:41] but my God the King of Kings the Lord of
[1:33:45] lords the god that is mighty in battle
[1:33:47] he won't leave you he won't forsake
[1:33:51] you oh wave that flag brother
[1:33:54] it's a sign that the angels of God are
[1:33:57] in this
[1:33:59] room come on Tommy run it's yours
[1:34:03] everything that God has for the church
[1:34:06] it's given under your hands so let's
[1:34:08] arise and possess every inheritance he
[1:34:11] didn't just give it to Andrew Spencer he
[1:34:13] didn't just give it to Donnie Reagan
[1:34:15] let's take this message right on into
[1:34:18] the coming of the Lord
[1:34:25] Hallelujah somebody stand up and give
[1:34:28] God
[1:34:31] praise there's more for you than there
[1:34:34] is against you he didn't come here just
[1:34:36] to leave you in your position leave you
[1:34:39] in your chaos he come to Rob he come to
[1:34:42] rob you away from Satan the one that he
[1:34:45] thought had you almighty God is here to
[1:34:50] deliver
[1:34:54] boo devil there's more for us brother
[1:34:57] Arwood than there is against us he's the
[1:35:01] answer to every
[1:35:07] problem
[1:35:08] watch why watch watch Abraham you can be
[1:35:12] seated if you want
[1:35:13] to watch
[1:35:18] Abraham one encounter with
[1:35:22] MDC was enough
[1:35:26] was
[1:35:29] enough what is it one acquaintance one
[1:35:33] time with MDC and it completely changed
[1:35:37] the
[1:35:38] Dilemma that Abraham was in what did he
[1:35:41] do when he talked to him in Genesis
[1:35:43] chapter 17 he began to come to him and
[1:35:46] place him in his rightful position he
[1:35:49] said now Abram walk before me the all
[1:35:53] almighty God he said walk before me and
[1:35:56] be thou perfect and what did he do he
[1:35:59] changed his name from Abraham five
[1:36:02] letters to Abraham of seven letters
[1:36:06] which is a sign what did it do after he
[1:36:08] changed his name what did it do it
[1:36:11] matched what God was he departed a part
[1:36:15] or deposited a part of himself on the
[1:36:18] inside of Abraham that everywhere
[1:36:20] Abraham went even though he was in with
[1:36:24] it before but then he had imparted a
[1:36:26] part of himself on the inside of Abraham
[1:36:30] it put him in position for the
[1:36:32] supernatural when he put the letter H on
[1:36:35] the inside of Abraham's name he
[1:36:37] deposited a part of himself so he
[1:36:41] couldn't leave him when troubles arise
[1:36:43] he couldn't lose him when Sarah was
[1:36:46] Miffy he could not lose him because God
[1:36:49] had imparted a part of himself on the
[1:36:52] inside of Abraham but I want you to know
[1:36:55] he didn't leave Sarah without it he
[1:36:57] imparted a part of her so that she would
[1:37:00] have the same Revelation that Abraham
[1:37:02] would have and after he changed
[1:37:05] Abraham's name when MDC come walking
[1:37:08] down that old dusty road there was three
[1:37:11] that was walking down there but William
[1:37:13] Brandon would say watch the effect of
[1:37:15] the vision that it had upon Abraham he
[1:37:18] said when there was three out there he
[1:37:20] said what did he do he said my Lord he
[1:37:23] he said he didn't see three he didn't
[1:37:25] say three he said but my Lord but watch
[1:37:28] those two angels go down their gr and oh
[1:37:31] Roberts go down there to Le osia and he
[1:37:33] said lot said my lords because the
[1:37:37] Revelation that was deposited to Abraham
[1:37:40] was matching the vision that he was the
[1:37:42] all-sufficient Elohim and William
[1:37:45] Brandon would say that Abraham's seed is
[1:37:47] to receive the same thing in this
[1:37:50] generation you can't see three gods if
[1:37:53] you wanted to because God has imparted a
[1:37:57] part of himself on the inside of the
[1:38:00] Church of the Living God what was it
[1:38:02] Abraham matched
[1:38:07] MDC Every Breath You Take expresses love
[1:38:12] to
[1:38:15] Yahweh when an atheist breathes he's
[1:38:18] breathing breath and he's breathing out
[1:38:20] the name Yahweh
[1:38:24] it has been studied out in the Jewish
[1:38:26] language that the breath that comes from
[1:38:29] you spells out of Y
[1:38:40] wa so if an atheist breathes a breath
[1:38:44] they're praising
[1:38:46] God you can't tell me there is no
[1:38:50] Jehovah he is my Yahweh he is Jehovah
[1:38:54] savior he is Jehovah tisu he is Jehovah
[1:38:58] Shalom he is Jehovah Rafa he is Jehovah
[1:39:02] ra my shepherd He is Jehovah madim he is
[1:39:06] yah way and he's all powerful he's
[1:39:12] omnipotent what did he do to Abraham he
[1:39:16] imparted his breath on the inside of
[1:39:19] Abraham because Abram could not do it on
[1:39:21] his own he could not bring worth a baby
[1:39:24] on his own he tried in his natural birth
[1:39:27] to have a holy ghost sensation without
[1:39:30] having God on his side so he produced it
[1:39:32] in the carnal by his wife Hagar but when
[1:39:35] MDC came he breathed into him the very
[1:39:39] life what was it it wasn't God it wasn't
[1:39:42] just Abraham but it was God and Abraham
[1:39:45] having a relationship and It produced a
[1:39:47] life that would testify that there's a
[1:39:50] greater Isaac that's coming
[1:39:53] it changed his name to match the
[1:39:57] character of who he
[1:39:59] was he changed Abram to
[1:40:02] Abraham he changed Sarah to Sarah he
[1:40:07] changed Jacob to Israel because Jacob's
[1:40:10] nature would never match what God had
[1:40:13] for him in his Destiny as Jacob as a
[1:40:16] Shyer as a liar as a troublemaker so he
[1:40:20] had a destiny that was in front of him
[1:40:22] so he had to change his name to match
[1:40:24] his nature he CH he changed Saul to Paul
[1:40:29] because he had a destiny in front of him
[1:40:32] so that it would match the destiny that
[1:40:34] was in front of him brother Joe that it
[1:40:36] would line up with what he had on the
[1:40:37] inside of
[1:40:40] him hallelujah hallelujah what did he do
[1:40:44] in this generation what did he do to you
[1:40:47] he said I'll no longer call you church
[1:40:49] because you can't match my inspiration
[1:40:52] you can't match my message message as a
[1:40:54] church therefore I will no longer call
[1:40:57] you church but I'll call you bride why
[1:40:59] because I've got to have a woman that is
[1:41:01] on this Earth that will match my
[1:41:03] inspiration that'll match who I am
[1:41:06] somebody that'll love me somebody
[1:41:08] that'll be there for me what did he do
[1:41:10] in this generation when William brandom
[1:41:13] when his great-grandfather was back
[1:41:15] there and was running from the law they
[1:41:17] changed his name from brandham to
[1:41:20] Branham in this generation because we
[1:41:23] know that it had to be thus and thus
[1:41:26] because never before time until Billy
[1:41:29] Graham come upon the scene has God ever
[1:41:32] had a messenger with the last word of
[1:41:35] ham it's since Abraham but Graham as we
[1:41:38] know is six letters but what did he do
[1:41:41] in this generation he was telling us he
[1:41:44] was pointing to us that Billy Graham did
[1:41:47] not have the power to match the
[1:41:49] rapturing message but there had to be a
[1:41:51] seventh angel that had had a name change
[1:41:54] that would match the destiny that's for
[1:41:56] the Church of the Living God so he wrote
[1:41:59] his name as an eternal sign before
[1:42:02] William brandom or any of us was here on
[1:42:04] Earth he gave him an eternal sign out
[1:42:07] there in the west he called out his
[1:42:09] ministry when he's standing there and
[1:42:11] standing in the Gap he told us he said
[1:42:14] if I could have had my own will I would
[1:42:16] have been a Trapper I'd have been no
[1:42:18] good I was going to leave and go up in
[1:42:20] the mountains and only be a Trapper and
[1:42:22] I'd come down out of the mountains and
[1:42:24] I'd preach when God would give me a
[1:42:26] visitation but then God be to show
[1:42:30] William brandom if you do that you'll
[1:42:32] lose your friends you'll lose your
[1:42:34] wife I'm so thankful that William
[1:42:36] brandham
[1:42:38] told told
[1:42:41] that because it showed us that even
[1:42:45] Prophet wanted his own
[1:42:47] will and there has been countless times
[1:42:49] in your life when you wanted your own
[1:42:51] will and if you'd have had your own will
[1:42:53] you'd have been in some Honky Tonk you'd
[1:42:55] have been in somebody else's arms you'd
[1:42:57] have been out there in the world strung
[1:42:59] out on different things maybe had a
[1:43:00] religious spirit on you but now because
[1:43:02] you didn't choose your will because
[1:43:05] there was a destiny that was over your
[1:43:07] life you had to line up with what God
[1:43:10] had already saw before you can't run
[1:43:13] away from this predestination you can
[1:43:15] run with everything you want to but
[1:43:17] you'll never get away from it because
[1:43:19] there's a call there's an election
[1:43:31] I feel
[1:43:32] good I feel good you can't get away from
[1:43:35] it you can't hide me from it you can try
[1:43:38] to shove me in a dungeon but I still
[1:43:40] believe this message you can try to shut
[1:43:42] me up but I still believe this message I
[1:43:45] feel good to know that God didn't send
[1:43:47] me a message a message of defeat a
[1:43:50] message of disgrace but he sent me a
[1:43:52] message of Grace to put me in position
[1:43:54] that will line up with what he thought
[1:43:56] of me before men had their ideas of me
[1:43:59] before men criticized me almighty God
[1:44:02] had a thought of
[1:44:07] me what was it he said Billy didn't know
[1:44:10] what was happening in the car he said
[1:44:11] but the angel was talking to
[1:44:14] me the angel was talking to me said if
[1:44:17] You' have went on your your plans he
[1:44:19] said but look over there to the
[1:44:20] mountains he said I don't see nothing I
[1:44:22] don't see nothing
[1:44:23] and he made him stop he said how many
[1:44:25] mountain peaks are on that he said seven
[1:44:28] he said it matches your
[1:44:30] name
[1:44:32] before before Noah got on a boat there
[1:44:36] was a mountain that spelled out an
[1:44:38] eternal sign William Mary and Brandon
[1:44:40] what did it do it didn't just tell him
[1:44:41] his name but it told him that you were
[1:44:43] in
[1:44:44] there I done listen to that tape 100
[1:44:47] times brother Andrew and I ain't heard
[1:44:48] my name I heard it a 100 thousand
[1:44:51] times because he told me that that that
[1:44:54] last mountain peak was my third pole and
[1:44:57] I saw myself brother Matthew I saw
[1:44:59] myself right there that I'm a part of
[1:45:02] that third pole people that there I am
[1:45:05] there I am even though Satan might war
[1:45:07] against me he might try to rob me he try
[1:45:10] he might try to do all kinds of things
[1:45:12] but there as an eternal sign I am
[1:45:15] matched up you can't separate me from
[1:45:17] the messenger I am the message
[1:45:25] come on now brother Andrew surely you
[1:45:27] don't believe it if you don't believe
[1:45:29] that you're a part of this message then
[1:45:30] you ought to run to this altar but you
[1:45:33] cannot separate me from William brandom
[1:45:36] he's my Prophet messenger but you can't
[1:45:38] separate me from Jesus because he is my
[1:45:44] message blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:45:46] Satan may come trials may come but I
[1:45:49] have failed my
[1:45:51] position it has been been announced unto
[1:45:53] me by a mighty angel you're not here on
[1:45:56] your own
[1:45:58] [Applause]
[1:46:01] accord
[1:46:03] hallelujah it's a signal to all of
[1:46:06] Hell there's an abstract title minded
[1:46:09] people here on Earth that knows what he
[1:46:12] wants done with the word there's a
[1:46:14] Harmony between her there's a hidden
[1:46:16] power that's laying on the inside of her
[1:46:19] and there's an angel that is here that
[1:46:20] has accompanied the Church of the Living
[1:46:22] God that is constantly vindicating the
[1:46:27] word what are you doing you're
[1:46:29] constantly expressing what he had on the
[1:46:31] inside of
[1:46:32] him what did he do what did he do when
[1:46:36] you see him in Revelations chapter 10 we
[1:46:38] saw a mighty Angel but do you see your
[1:46:41] position as pillars of fire standing
[1:46:45] over the land and the
[1:46:51] Sea if Satan is out from underneath your
[1:46:55] feet he's out of his
[1:47:03] position it's
[1:47:06] time it's
[1:47:08] time that the Church of the Living God
[1:47:11] put Satan right back in his right
[1:47:13] position he's been reigning over you
[1:47:16] reigning over your life he's been trying
[1:47:18] to rob your family he's been trying to
[1:47:20] rob your joy it's time that he finds his
[1:47:22] position back under your feet and if he
[1:47:26] ain't under your feet get him back
[1:47:28] underneath of your position as a son and
[1:47:30] daughter of God robed in the robes as a
[1:47:33] Son of God hallelujah walking with the

[1:47:49] message so that every devil in hell
[1:47:51] knows that where I

[1:49:12] kingdom from this eternity that at that
[1:49:15] eternity there's a gene seat of God that
[1:49:17] is pushing you towards the matching of
[1:49:20] the message
[1:49:25] now surely if he can do it for a little
[1:49:28] insignificant fish and you're a third
[1:49:31] pole people and you have an eternal sign

[1:49:42] accomplished if it was enough if if had
[1:49:45] had enough power that she could attach
[1:49:47] herself to a third pole Ministry and
[1:49:49] prodal would fall to their feet how
[1:49:52] about

[1:50:59] mountain how about your
[1:51:01] Mountain how about your
[1:51:04] troubles why don't you take this message
[1:51:07] in your position not out of your emotion
[1:51:10] not out of your feelings not because you
[1:51:12] need it to happen but as your
[1:51:14] position that's why when I come to this
[1:51:17] Altar and I pray over you I never pray
[1:51:19] over you as just Andrew Spencer but I
[1:51:21] recognize that you have came to an
[1:51:23] office an office that was set up before
[1:51:25] I was ever here I take it very personal
[1:51:28] and I believe that you ought to
[1:51:29] recognize the office that God has put
[1:51:31] you in as the Bride of Jesus Christ you
[1:51:34] recognize your position if he could
[1:51:36] speak storms out of existence and he
[1:51:38] could start taking a walk with King
[1:51:39] theophany how much more can you start
[1:51:42] taking a walk with your theophany that
[1:51:44] one of these days you'll take a step
[1:51:47] half a way this way and they'll take a
[1:51:49] half a step that way and in a moment
[1:51:57] what is it you're aware you're aware
[1:52:00] that this ain't just some preaching

[1:52:06] presence it comes here on Wednesdays it
[1:52:09] comes here Sundays he meets you in your
[1:52:12] car you're aware that it's more than a
[1:52:14] man you're here you feel his anointing
[1:52:17] what is it it's a sign to you that you
[1:52:20] have a power to reach out and touch him
[1:52:22] and maybe you're like that little woman
[1:52:24] that had a blood issue she didn't need
[1:52:26] to touch his hand she didn't need just
[1:52:28] to touch his head all she needed was
[1:52:30] Touch The Fringe of His Garment maybe
[1:52:32] that's your condition right here I'm
[1:52:34] coming to you maybe that's your
[1:52:36] condition where all you feel like you
[1:52:38] got enough strength is to reach through
[1:52:40] the crowd and Touch the Hem of His
[1:52:42] Garment but he's here for
[1:52:47] you you got more power than you think
[1:52:52] science tells us that when we get to the
[1:52:55] end of our strength when we think we
[1:52:57] can't go no more we have 30% left in
[1:53:06] us when Navy Seals when the elite of the
[1:53:09] elite go through their training and they
[1:53:11] go through their problem when they have
[1:53:12] to go through they have to swim they
[1:53:14] have to go they have to run they have to
[1:53:15] walk then they go and do all these
[1:53:17] pull-ups when they get to their end of
[1:53:19] their Reserve there's somebody there to
[1:53:21] tell them you got 30% left when you
[1:53:25] think you can't go no more when you
[1:53:27] think you can't handle it no more you
[1:53:29] still got 30% left that's just in your
[1:53:32] natural but I want to remind you who's
[1:53:34] standing behind you you ain't just got
[1:53:37] 30% you got 100% of all of Heaven that
[1:53:41] is standing behind you why don't you go
[1:53:43] ahead and claim everything that you have
[1:53:46] need of claim the Holy Ghost claim the

[1:54:17] pole people call for Ron Spencer and
[1:54:19] tumors dissolve how much more for your
[1:54:25] situation he didn't bring you here to

[2:01:12] not some far off distant but it's right
[2:01:15] there by them and they can bump right
[2:01:18] into a world that can completely Chang
[2:01:22] their
[2:01:25] situation father into your hands we
[2:01:29] commit these needs just
[2:01:32] now brother to a brother sister to a
[2:01:34] sister all
[2:01:36] over I want you to lay your hands over
[2:01:38] on one another just
[2:01:42] now God sees
[2:01:44] you and he's not left you here without a
[2:01:48] witness but right
[2:01:50] now he can take Shing go and remove them
[2:01:53] out of this
[2:01:55] place he can take heart disease and move
[2:01:59] it out of his
[2:02:00] place he can cause kidney failures to
[2:02:04] completely dry
[2:02:07] up he's a God that sees family
[2:02:10] matters when maybe they won't even come
[2:02:13] to the house of God but he sees your
[2:02:17] witness that you could he deposits
[2:02:19] something on the inside of you that
[2:02:21] would cause an attraction to the
[2:02:23] manifestation of who he
[2:02:25] is Father God hands are laid on one
[2:02:29] another throughout this building just
[2:02:30] now Lord I don't have the power or the
[2:02:33] ability to pray for every one of them
[2:02:36] but the same power that is laying here
[2:02:38] upon the bosom of my soul is laid out
[2:02:41] across this congregation science even
[2:02:43] tells us and is a witness to us that
[2:02:45] when we lay our hands over on one
[2:02:47] another that a light is transferred oh
[2:02:50] God I pray in this place just now father
[2:02:53] that there would be demonstrations of
[2:02:55] the acts of your word not just something
[2:02:58] that we read about but I pray that there
[2:03:00] would be a significant impression of the
[2:03:02] Holy Ghost that would be placed upon the
[2:03:05] brother and sister's lives that their
[2:03:07] hand is laid upon I ask father that you
[2:03:10] would come and demonstrate your power
[2:03:12] Lord if angels would come and put
[2:03:14] Samuel's parents in their position
[2:03:16] zachariah's parents in their position to
[2:03:19] watch the messenger come father you have
[2:03:21] came this day this hour this scripture
[2:03:24] is fulfilled and we recognize that you
[2:03:27] have come and you have placed the Church
[2:03:29] of the Living God back in her rightful
[2:03:31] position I call for healing through
[2:03:34] these bodies I call for a Deliverance of
[2:03:37] those that are bound just now father May
[2:03:40] Satan take his dirty hands off of God's
[2:03:43] Property and may sons that are bound and
[2:03:46] daughters that are bound with fear may
[2:03:48] they run out of this place completely
[2:03:50] made whole say and take your leave just
[2:03:53] now you are no longer welcome in our
[2:03:55] mind in our spirit in our soul you're
[2:03:58] not welcome and we dismiss you in the
[2:04:00] name of Jesus Christ and father we
[2:04:03] invite you to bring healing to our body
[2:04:06] to restore our mind you have not given
[2:04:09] us the spirit of fear but of love and of
[2:04:11] a sound mind father to do thy will I
[2:04:15] pray that you'd have your way in this
[2:04:17] place just now father
