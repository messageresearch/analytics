man got a baby dedication if brother Daniel was just to bring the little son will dedicate him to the Lord today bring bring from the fears of Brie me bring me [Music] - once - gee I turned to dedicate him under babies not when their hive grown little man any let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father the joy that's in my brother and sisters heart today I'm sure it's beyond what they can even explain to be able to look down at a little boy or a little girl see the mixture of their DNA and their chromosomes and truly it's a miracle how our nation so many many years ago fall into such a place where they would legalize killing such little gifts from God we're grateful for men and women who still desire to bring children into the earth to assume the awesome responsibility of trying to love them nurtured and raised them we thank your father for our brother and sister we pray the Spirit of God would help them give them wisdom Lord give them strength to be able to know how to raise the little son to be able to teach him in the admonition of God maybe so so familiar with the sounds of prayer in their home made a music of the gospel be able to be something that he's raised from just a little guy of hearing may the Word of God be implanted so in his heart the enemy gets old enough to be able to make the choice of right from wrong the impression upon his little mind will be so great there'll be no question which way he will go your prophet tells us Lord of some boys brothers many of them that was raised in a home oldest one went to be a sailor second and so on and so on and so on they would begin to question and wonder what it was that imprinted upon their little lives and went back and found out that it was a picture of a boat in the bedroom where they were all raised and it's so imprinted something on their hearts if a picture can do that what about the love of God father we bring into you today dedicated a life to you for a life of service we thank you for God keep him from the evils of the day the diseases and sicknesses that are so rampant father in Jesus name we pray amen notice brother West was ready clapping loud there he may was we believe our children are part of our heritage as the people of God of who we are it's a great great privilege to be able to bring children into the Earth's and then to assume the responsibility to raise them and teach them she's so sad that our our society and our civilization has become so self-centered that millions of babies being aborted it's a one day our nation as well as the nations of the world will stand before God an answer for all that they've done when you look at it some animals have more love for their young then people do you ever look at a chimpanzee or an ape or a silverback those males that are in charge of their family will fight to the death to protect a wee baby and some human beings are so beneath animals they will give their babies away we hear about it all the time being dropped in a garbage disposal woman give birth to a baby and target and walk off and leave it men women walk off and leave their babies do you understand where we are people are lower than monkeys apes when I told my comparing a human to another human we're talking about our society our world is lower than animals take the Spirit of God off of a human being they are worse than a chimpanzee worse than an ape that's why I thank God for parents that want to raise their kids most of time whenever I dedicate these babies I'm dedicating her mom and dad along with them you can have a sad song it was really it's something that little baby didn't come with a manual he didn't come with a book or a CD on how to a man god bless you let's read together today Song of Solomon chapter 7 verse 11 will read through verses 13 counted a privilege to be able to be gathered together again today in the presence of the Lord come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us Lodge in the villages let us get up early to the vineyards let us see if the vine flourish whether the tender grape appear the pomegranates bud forth there will I give thee my loves remember now the pomegranates on the Mediterranean area are two colors the red and the white the mixture of the cross so she's identifying her redemption in the colors of the Scarlet in the white the pomegranates bud force there will I give thee my loves the mender eggs give a smell and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits new and old which I have laid up for thee o my beloved let's pray together Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you Lord Jesus that we have ears to be able to hear it we ask father as James said so many many years ago may we not be forgetful hearers may not only just acknowledge that it's right and acknowledge that it's true but father made to be something that will correspond in our souls that will help us to want to live it as we look into the great things that lay before us today I pray that you would anoint us Lord may we move for just a few moments as it were beyond time may we leave this building may our thoughts being raptured in the presence of God or what great things lay in front of us our future is definitely clear how thankful we are Lord be with us today speak to us once again we ask the name of the Lord Jesus the Saint said God bless you you may be seated mm-hmm for those of you that wasn't with us last night we were looking at some of the purposes of God fulfilling the millennium and the cause of the millennium of what he wants to fulfill and the word the first one that we looked just a background for just a little bit the first one that we looked at it is the transition from time and to eternity the transition from the age that we currently live in into the eighth day the age of perfection and states of perfection also God will finalize and complete the Abrahamic covenant that was made to Abraham that the children of Israel will be able to have this land and he along with them also the Palestinian covenant which was the Covenant made with God and the people to the land of Palestine and we looked at it and showing that God's promises though they may linger yet God is obligated to his own character to fulfill that word then thousands and thousands of years since God told Abraham that he and his seed would be heir to the land yet to this very day a stone under the horn just a little bit ago there's walls and things built around Israel as we was there in May and seeing the minarets which is a sign of an Arab community they have it divided into three basic categories and groups and you got Arabs over here which is they have their autonomy their own autonomy to make their own laws and all those sorts of things and Israelis not even allowed in there and yet that land belongs to them how is it that you've got these these Palestinian Authority and you've got you know all the people of the world saying you can do this and you can't do that and you cannot according to the promise of God God gave it to Abraham what caused it their sin it's the same way with us God gives us the righteous Christians to be all these things that he wants just to be but when we allow sin to come in our life and the devil tells us what we can and will and cannot do but we realize that God is going to restore our lands as he's going to restore the Land of Israel and it's the promise of God so we'd like to pick up on that this morning and and be able to look at there another covenant that God made it is called the Davidic covenant now this is beyond of course the Adamic covenant this is beyond the covenant given to Abraham it goes along with it but yet it's more complimentary it's more catered to one man and his his lineage then it would be the nation itself now God shows of course Abraham being a Gentile and God calls him out makes him a great covenant promise then God goes inside of that lineage and divides it and he makes the Levites even more called out than the Land of Israel itself and then God can break it down on an individual basis to where that God picks certain individuals to do certain things above the nation and that's what he done to David so God was not just making a man that he would be able to be a king for forty years which was the ideal span of time that God would let a man be a king and the natural sense but God was also making a future Kingdom he's going to make the Davidic covenant by which God will make certain promises to David and David's line alone which will not apply to the rest of the children of Israel you believe God can do that God can call certain individuals it can make them preachers pastors prophets he can make them whatever he wants to make them and God can give them above their brethren God can give them more things than their brethren the rest of the brethren should be able to accept that but many times of course they don't but God chose David he was of course the wee one the one that everybody else thought mild oh never never ever happened to him as a matter of fact whenever the Prophet comes and he calls for Jesse to bring his sons in he don't even remember David well that's greatly to be loved and thought about by your daddy in it that when daddy calls in all the brothers you're the only one they forget so they just kind of leave you out there where you belong because you're kind of an odd head anyway so they leave you out there by yourself you're a little bit fanatical you're quite musical and most musical people can be kind of highly emotional and so on so they leave him out there because he shouts and jumps around and place the harp and everything so they thought he might you know really interrupt this saying no he wasn't gonna interrupt it as a matter of fact he was the reason the Prophet was there so let it be known to you and I today we're not going to interrupt heaven were one of the reasons that heaven is made I'm one of the reasons that there is a rapture so I'm not going to be an interruption to the rapture so God calls David now we'll read this if you would in second Samuel Chapter 7 verse 8 and this is identified and called the Davidic covenant now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David thus saith the Lord of hosts I took thee from the sheep coat from following the Sheep to be ruler over my people over Israel I was with see whether so ever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth now notice this is not inclusive with all of Israel this is the Davidic covenant that is hidden inside the Abrahamic covenant also hid inside the Palestinian covenant you understand now God is going to make a special covenant with this man which is separate but inclusive with the Abrahamic covenant notice in verse 10 moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel and we will plant them now notice David is in the land of Palestine in the land of Israel whenever the prophet of God is going to say these words to him but yet God's saying it as if though this is a future event that God is going to appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more now notice this is important it is key when we understand the tense of God's word that God says things in present tense God will say them in past tense and God will say them in future tense now here they are present tense they're living in the land David of course has his capital in Jerusalem and the land of Israel is prospering during very well never entered actually into the full boundary from the River Nile over to the Euphrates but quite a quite a large possession of land but yet God is saying they will move no more wise God saying this because God is speaking prophetically and putting the tense of the word they've got a lot of moves before this portion of the word will come to pass now this will coincide with the Abrahamic covenant that God will give it to them and they will never move it will also coincide with a Palestinian covenant that they will never have to move again but so far it seems as if though they're in a great peaceful time and they'll move no more neither shall the children of wickedness which included the Philistines they amirite the Jews the poles ALS and all those that are born of Abraham are not the seed of Abraham all Jews are not elect Jews will persecute the 144,000 that's right Jews will persecute the hundred and forty-four thousand just like so-called message people were persecuted the bride because they're not the same thing notice that God puts them all in one category and he says the children of wickedness will afflict them no more as before time now friends honest so we can all say that this scripture has not been fulfilled as of yet because the children of Israel are still under great oppression from all different points around the world even though they're not all gathered in in Jerusalem or in the land of Palestine we know that it will finally wind up with all the nations of the earth gathering together and the battle which is in the valley of Megiddo which is called Armageddon and there of course Christ will come down and fight for them notice he says in verse 11 and there since the time that I commended judges to be over my people Israel have calls thee to rest from all thine enemies the Lord tell us see that he will make thee on a house now a house it's not what we would think that God's gonna build him a structure but a house was something that God would give them a heritage which was a name and a reputation and a character which would actually outlive their natural posterity on the earth so David's gonna live to be 70 something years old and he will die but God said I'm going to build you a house which will not die when you die in other words your name and your posterity and your identification will live much longer than you ever live because I'm gonna build you a house and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with I fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and remember scripture can have a compound meaning and we're going to read a portion here that does out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom I notice speaking of the son of David in the spiritual sense but also of Solomon in the natural sense he shall build a house for my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever but of course we know that didn't happen to Solomon because it was actually taken away from him because of his unbelief now here the watch how God does this in his slides in the Messianic kingdom of Christ and then he reverts back to the Solomonic Kingdom in verse 14 I will be his father and he shall be my son if he commits iniquity which couldn't apply to the Lord Jesus since he never done that I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but my mercy listen to scripture how profound but my she shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee now freely tell you something you talking about something the same God who offers us mercy can also take it away and I don't care how much you beg how much you scream and how much you holler for it if God takes it you're done so am I so the nation so we see then it was God who gave the Mersenne you saw but notice they call Solomon is going to be a part and a beneficiary of the Davidic covenant God tells him and God knows that Solomon will get away but God tells him even before Solomon ever rings if he ever gets away from me I will treat him because of you I will treat him different than the way I treated Sol because whenever he messes up I will treat him with a rod of Correction I will use Kings I will use people I will use all these things and I will not I promise you David I will not cut off your son well if God could make that promise today that how much more can God the spirit make that promise to the body Jesus and say I will never cut off your seed this is why you're secure today my friends are because of our faithfulness not because we're so good why I feel one for the mercy of God nobody no telling where we'll all be this morning that's right notice undyne house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever and before it see notice now it's not just going to be established forever but it will be established forever before thee speaking of a time that David will be in existence and the word forever of the Hebrew of course says nu on which is a space of time but your kingdom will be so established that the years and the generations will pass and you will see it which could not come to pass when he was a mere mortal but it will come to pass my score of five notice again in Psalms eighty-nine three I have made a covenant with my chosen I love this word chosen look at it the Hebrew word book here choice one chosen one elect of God nobody asked you some do you reckon the early apostolic church was Free Will Baptist you got come there in the Apostolic Church had any problem with predestination and election and for ordination you reckon I mean then Ben shoes and coming with this background of election you imagine what some of the Apostolic preachers how they would hear some of the message preachers preach predestination and they say you boys don't even know nothing about first peace you imagine them struggling with free moral agency and imagine them really having a hard time trying to understand predestination not at all predestination election foreknowledge sovereignty of God was a common teaching among the Apostolic believers as it will be among the restored Apostolic believers in the last day only the free will Baptists among also struggle with it not a purse Allah believers because it's a foundation of who they were they believed they were the chosen people can you imagine any are the Apostolic Christians Jews solving how we're struggling believe in the election they would have never had such a struggle why the whole basis of who they were was based upon God's choice not theirs [Music] well i'ma just go ahead and say it some of you may not like it but I wonder how many apostolic sermons were ever preached entitled free moral agency show me one New Testament sermon that was ever preached or they ever quoted says it wasn't even written to a powerless dead jesus saying in the book of Revelation whosoever will let him come show me one place in your Bible what they ever stood up and preached it what did they preach though elect according to the foreknowledge of God and the sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth that's what they believed oh my goodness how nor if I get all fat it's you need that or you notice how Psalms 89 for thy seed will I establish forever and build up dice wrong to all generations Salah verse 34 my covenant well I'm not break nor alter the saying that is gone out of my lips once ever sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David his seed shall endure forever and his throne wow this is part of the Davidic covenant love friends it's not yet happened but it well here's Sloane as the Sun before me notice I'm Sadie 937 and shall be established forever as the moon and ice of faithful witness in heaven Salah Salah was a musical cannon tation kind of like a pause or turn around as would call it in the music I remember this was a song it must have been really something that David was singing about himself and said 1:30 to 11 or Psalms whether the Lord has sworn in truth under David he will not turn from it of the fruit of thy body will set upon thy throne I don't care what the pol says PLO I don't care what Arabs say I don't care what the English say I don't care what Trump says or Obama says or nobody else said this is why God says the Land of Israel belongs to the children of the Israel and they're fixin to take it over not only them but we are too now I am currently a resident of Tennessee in the United States of America but before long I'm changing my residents praise be to God amen won't be very very long I'm going in the rapture I'm gonna be there for three and a half years I'm coming back down to rule with my lord upon this earth of which I will have an address for a thousand years I will then be lifted out Paul the heiress's been furlough I will come back down here my noose and here I will live forever let's go in [Applause] how many's movin Westmead lord chenna if we could get our eyes on the promises the promises and realize how close they are how these things out here would fade nor lose hosea hosea chapter 3 verse 5 is he says afterward shall the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their God and David their keep they'll seek the Lord their God and they'll be saying or David David's gotta be here somewhere thank you and shall fear the Lord and His goodness when in the latter days before time fades out and the last thousand year increment is finished it blends into eternity Luke 1:31 behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus they are xuan he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David so David his father but yet he's David's father this is a father-son relationship glory to God and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end the resurrected King David will rule as a prince under the Dominion of King Jesus that will be Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Reuben it's a car dad Naftali Judah on and on and on Jeremiah Zakaria hi guys Atika o all the saints of God will they design glorified bodies yes the elected god Jews will be resurrected and glorified bodies that will be the election table rod made up to seven Church ages and glorified bodies and that will be millions of human beings living on the earth and natural and glorified bodies do you understand that will be a resurrection that will call them out out the graves and glorified bodies and that will be a resurrection of the heathen in non glorified bodies you said you mean God can cause a man to get up from the dead and not have a glorified body why don't you ask Lazarus why don't you ask the little maid he called her from the dead and she real-life Cecilia for how many every years and died after his resurrection [Applause] now let us move from here let's move to the Book of Daniel Daniel sees the coronation of King Jesus praise God you and I are so excited about the rapture under such anticipation can you imagine King Jesus he has been waiting now for 2,000 years he's been a victor he's been a vector to be able to redeem his people from sin but he's been waiting for 2,000 years to actually be crowned King never in history did a king ever wait 2,000 years to be crowned but he put off the coronation until all of his elect could be there in glorified bodies ancients could have already done it well he said I don't want you doing it laughter sure can you imagine how much he loves you and how much he wants to incorporate you into who he is that he don't even want to be crowned yet until the gentle ages are done until his people can stand there and dressed in garments glorified bodies that would be fitted for the occasion it would be unbecoming for us sustained there now in these bodies and crown him King we're going to crown him King the eternal walk and standing there in mortal rights just and Isis so he said I'm gonna put the coronation off I'm gonna wait till seven ages have passed till every name that is in my personal diary has been redeemed then I'll pick the day that he'll become crowned and the day I become a crown is the day I will crown her Queen notice Daniel 7:13 I saw in the night visions and behold one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to this bright light this pillar of fire this invisible God which cannot even be seen unless he had take on elements of time to be able to make himself notice I can't believe in anything invisible really then your words do you see him really what about your sauce you took about handle and played with him but I love joy peace in this of all Jesus is the image of the invisible God and here the visible image comes before the invisible lure came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him there before him go over to God remember God is not a man our friends could grasp this if you could be able to see it it would straighten up all your misunderstanding about the Godhead God is not a man God is not a human being God is spirit [Music] there was given him Dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed notice in verse 27 and the kingdom and

over the little things and the big lord over the little aeroknives he is king of kings and lord of I don't just mean he's above all the rest of Kings it means that he is the king of kings well going

father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen revelation 5:10 and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth praise be to God revelation 20 and 6 verse and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death has no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so the Saints will resurrect in glorified bodies and share the kingdom with the king according to what you have done with what God's given you and life will be the delegated authority given to you in the Millennium now remember it's not just about what God does it all and I'll just kind of set around trouble my sons and oh no no no no you see those things you and I can do with what God gives us God gives you a gift what do you that gift God gives you an ability God force money in your hands God puts different things in your hand and your reward now remember the Saints of God will not be judged before the white throne judgment we go before their the seat of Christ but it's only for rewards [Music] you're going to be standing before him according to what according to what you've done what's what God put in your hands well I got nothing you've got time you've got your life you've got your minds you've got your wheel you've got all of that and God will make us answer our reward is determined according to what we do with what God puts in our hands oh all brother Donny I'm not sure I believe that well Matthew chapter 19 verse 28 jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration of the Son of Man will sit in the throne with the glory you shall also set with me upon twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel now these of course are apostolic judges will everybody get that nope Matthew chapter 25 verse 21 his Lord said unto Him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord now here we're not talking that preachers you ever tell my lay folks God puts things in our hands abilities influence gifts talents so on and so on your reward will be according to what you do with them now some people want to do the minimum requirement what do I have to do just to barely make it in I don't have people I can't even say they love God anybody that don't want to give him their all that child he's done for us I don't understand it I got to be honest I just don't [Applause] some folks it's not they're afraid they'll do too much really you're gonna do too much for god you're gonna pray too much to read your Bible too much give up too much there ain't no way notice he says in Luke 22 28 ya ye that all which I have continued with me and my temptations again the Apostles and I'll appoint you a kingdom as my father has appointed unto me that you may eat and drink at my table you imagine been able to eat was King Jesus Jesus points you out brother Jim say Jimmy come we would have lunch at me Fred won't have breakfast of manna morning and you're sitting there about the eternal one himself I'm so glad that father wanted the condon sin into a form that I'd be able to touch I wouldn't be able to relate really to a big that's just liked and a consuming fire and power and invincibility I wouldn't be able to relate to sir and God knew that so God said I don't want to become one like you all so I will I will actually become one like you and I will take upon the humanity and I will call that the Son of God and I will let that be me which will be able to be identified with you and you can touch it you can look at it you can bow down you can put your arms around he'll put your his arms around you I can't touch light I can't grab ahold of a pillar of fire but I can grab ahold of nail-scarred hands houghton nail-scarred siege 2nd Timothy chapter 2 verse 12 if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he will also deny us revelation 2:26 he that overcometh and keepeth my works and it amazing here he doesn't say word and what was the works of the Lord Jesus casting out Devils heat on the sick raising the dead it's not just those of you who quotes the Prophet it's not just because you think here quoting the words you're going to get in right here the inclusive part part of God is the power of God acts 1:8 be inside of you that the continuing works of the Lord Jesus will be reflected in the believers churches well praise God I enjoyed that I'm sorry y'all did he that overcometh and keepeth my works so there'll be an apostolic church right on down to the rapture unto the end to him will I give power over the nations where seventh day dawn of the seventh now listen how we're gonna rule and he speaking about the overcomer well shall rule them with a rod of iron now this is not the eighth day that they no need to have a rod of iron in the eighth day nobody that's hard to edit so you don't need a rod so got some hard hits of the milady well praise all we do millions of emails that'll be resurrected and they'll make their choice inland and many of them will have to be rule under sanctification don't you smoke don't you drink don't you know we'll see we're doing it right now through the gospel dispensation of the kingdom of God we're ruling now with the rod of the gospel preaching sanctification and hammering it out in people's lives until they get born again in the Millennium I say everybody come up to the house of the Lord at the Feast of Tabernacles some of the Egyptians and some of the rest of them said I'm gone Lord said suit yourself body go take care of you and Tim go together you two make quite a team the young Tim hood got out and tell them the chips

crazy know what I touch what he tells us in the adoption series that's when the sons of God will be manifested he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers even as I have received of my father both sound like it gonna be some rough stuff going on that any man but don't worry little chilly today for you don't worry that a wifey here gonna beat you around kick you around that's just a man that don't deserve a wife in the first place they treat their wives that way Jesus ain't gonna use no rod on you your converted you got a new body standing there but he wants to make this transition from the seventh day to the eighth day when he will be able to present the kingdom to this invisible God and say every enemy has been subjected every enemy death hell the grass everything hasn't been totally conquered then the father light will say to the body son and the body we call Jesus emerges back into the father and turns and comes back around as it were and walks that was such brilliance the very God no more mediate or no more intercession no more necessary not only two types of kings on the earth and the Millennium the type that lives in glorified bodies the type that live in human bodies the types that live in human bodies will set up under their Nations the government the Jesus will be the prime minister or the King every government if it's the bodily nationalities like Africans and Indians and what are the more every government on the outs in the days of the millennium will be under the headship of the Lord Jesus and there will be natural kings there unconverted you see why he wants to prove it can be done don't you understand what what much of this is about is to prove to him I can do this I've got this you say why would it why would at the end that way how did it start it started in the Garden of Eden with the Kingdom of Heaven under the government of Almighty God given to his vice-regent on the earth how will it end the forest back into eternity glory to God a little less kingdoms on the earth except this time it won't be one man and one woman it will be millions of them in the Vice Regents on the earth by the government of the control of the son of David and they will say you do this you do this holiness to the Lord we go to the house of God to worship with you this yes sir so I praise God amen well darn it you know take Satan back and say look look you stopped my reign by my divine government in the Garden of Eden I prove to you with this little ol chain of circumstance all I've got to do is get rid of you and I can do what [Applause] we're talking about millions of people on the earth that don't even have the Holy Ghost can you imagine rubbing shoulders with Saints and glorified bodies can you imagine saints of God they're standing there looking at you and all of a sudden they decide they want to be in Norway you're stand there talking to many poof they vanish he's like may I get you sir if they do me that way all the time this is not a dream this is not some wild hat stop story this is your future [Applause] this is your dream oh brother branham took his wife on a hunting trip for the honeymoon Jesus Jesus has taken his wife for a governmental trip on their honeymoon you know you get tired of sat apparent heavens just drinking whatever we drink and eating whatever lead I know some of you your ideal of heaviness Dunkin Donuts on every corner all the coffee all the donuts all the brûlées all the things you can eat and you never get fat some of you that's heaven right I mean that's alpha did that's it my bad one the brothers told me that they said you said baskin-robbins wouldn't be at him and he said but I believe Duncan will be but that's as far as our minds can allow us to go we pick out our prices and what we enjoy me think well that's whatever it'll be it'll just be a great big dose of what I like best no it's for a reason a purpose I jump in yet okay oh my I see him as he walks around the corner over there he's kind of read the tin of his skin dear Lord it's Hannah beneath and he comes up to the second half the house before him I mean brother doubt he'll be there he will be there human hers waterfall is what brought all this upon the earth but remember his choice in the Garden of Eden was not brother he wanted to be a son of God or not it was whether he wanted to stay in the pavilion of God's protection word his name was on the boat no doubt the very next one under Jesus alphabetical order what in God's or mouth why didn't God annihilate him because he was God's magining walking through life for years and years and every baby double-car ever deaths that happened for his 930 years him dealing with that thinking how could I ever forgive myself you think you've done a lot of wrong you think you've done a lot of guilt how would you like to have been Adam that one thing if you descend and die but you live for hundreds and hundreds hundreds of years to see your sin x and t i would ever look at himself he was able to go back and say my father awful the lamp in my place and I've got to believe somehow iLab the tones for me [Applause] I can't match him what he must have went through and it's not the first 80 head out of the garden the first broken bone that somebody in the family had first baby was born plant a crippled reminiscing of what it must have been inside that car I caused all of this can you ever forgive me my son Abel is dead his half-brother took his life treating him like an animal it's my fault oh the Sandomierz it's my fault you imagine when he steps out that day he's got Eve by the hand her blonde hair hanging down her back her blue eyes we all stay loose we'll know who the Archos will be in our theophany bodies merge together or glorified someone know all things you say I preached about you on Oh I've imagined what you must have looked oh we won't seven remember the Lord Jesus called Adam and Eve neared words it's all over Adam I didn't make you do this but you see because you're done what you've done look at all this wife I've got there and then look at all this group that's living outside to see the Animus that's what I call the whosoever lugar I've got all them too and if I don't only call those out of the book of life Adam that they'd never been here because they wasn't in the Lamb's Book of Life don't beat yourself down I took your mistakes and I was able to turn it around Adam you're forgiven Lord Shiva if you'd I could look at it today some of you still living under the guilt of your stand you're staying in your past and you're standing you that Satan condemned you day in and day out you all will be able to stand by the grace of God 930 years of seeing such stuff and say I am forgiven I don't know how an innocent lamb could be able to be taken in by poison Almighty God forgive me for that but I have to accept it I can see him he's 900 in 30th year he's already got old now which I reckon you would it down 130 he got up that morning you've said you okay thank you I've been thinking a lot about don't home Adam no no don't you go talking me like this I stand over the other day just sharing some of the brothers what it was locked back here if I got so sick Adam don't please don't leave me you've been my shield I'll protect you not a man whatever never all travelled me in the guard never let me be burnt but you forfeited your king don't make me oh maybe he just something's kind of passing but it's some pass when I imagine one day when he was sitting in a coffee shop there was this young guy come here you see know this crown of people gathered around this old man he knew who was cause he heard his name was he knock oh look at the chronology even though Abraham disappears out the pages of the Bible and the light of God changes from Abraham to Isaac Abraham is still alive when Isaac fades off the scene steps out of the pages of the Bible and the focus comes on Jacob Isaac is still alive you imagine this young guy little bitty ol guy and hears about these stories of these dinosaurs we're home in the paradise of God and they say brother Adam words are telling us that want to get about how he used to come down Merida put you all to sleep at night but I've told that one over and over again but please would you tell it just once more well it was it was the most wonderful thing I'm telling you what it was just well medieval II would just stay on the earth that day and I'd move trees and the former furniture that's why yes Adams do it today and and then in the evening I'd say even sweet heart it's time for us to go up to the big Cathedral to worship God and directly would hear it and I'd look over the bushes and others that yellowish green light and I'd heard that voice children have you enjoyed your stay on earth today we couldn't be afraid but it was a holy reference it was on all but we wasn't afraid and would say oh yes Papa said I've come down to kiss you good night Lily knocks him over they're gone Gordon God I want to know God that so what did he do I'll never forget his own cell he he had taken lay me down there in the garden or some branches and leaves everything was so comfortable and he laid me down he take my arm and he'd stretch my arm out like that and I remembered just like it was yesterday he laid my arm out and then he'd take a Eve and he'd lay her down in her hair and you know put her hair account over my arm that way and then he'd reach over you see you'd reach over and kissing me children what makes you feel funny who's your preacher top because you've never been able to have that yet but it ain't gonna be long your Lord Jesus ain't gonna lay out your husband's arm but he's going to come walking down the length of that table thousands of miles off and take his a garment he'll reach up and say JD oh crap you'll be able to take your hands and grab ahold here's her arm and just pull him over close to you God and I can't do that got a consuming fire can't do it but this is God your more faith in his sonship you imagine living on the earth in the Millennium but every day the natural Kings on the earth will set up the government their school's their education I've said it several times I know but I'm gonna keep on sin until I get off of it every school will be a Bible School you'll be born under the knowledge of God but the heathen won't be they will be talked about the Lord who do you figure in this building knows me the very best today my daughter's know me well my son in-laws know me you brothers at work with me know me but who do you reckon knows me the best of all the people in this church today of all my friends around the world who do you figure knows me the best you know who it is it's that little woman sitting right there and I don't want to brag but I just want to be flat honestly that there ain't nobody that knows Jesus like his precious 144,000 they've got a great wonderful relationship the kings of the earth will have a great wonderful relationship but brother Louie who knows about his grace who knows about his mercy who knows about his compassion his forgiveness like the elect let us close so in retrospect excuse me as I go backwards what a great thing it must have been when the volcano said cool down the tsunamis from the oceans had all lain flat the black rich dirt from the heart of the earth had now covered it the seeds which have been spoken by his word started to sprout and the waters were washed off and gathered the great expanse of the waters was gathered up in the expanse of what is called the heavens and then a great majority of it went down to the earth reserved for flood time and the reservoirs in the earth and the dawn of that seventh morning God makes his son and his wife then God says I'm going to rest now the great dinosaurs coming through the paradise of God the great birds with wingspans of who knows how big landing on Adam's shoulders a beautiful paradise but Adam's sin put that dawn of the seventh morning on pause so you're listening to a sermon from brother Branham or your favorite preacher whoever it is someone calls you on the phone and you pause to do what later resumed right so Adam reached over by free moral agency so what free moral agency is good for reached over and touch the button Paul's he did not have access to stop neither did the devil so all of a sudden the seventh morning paused the dinosaur started looking at each other different the wharf which had laid by the lamb and the little kid and they were friends and frolicked and not only his little ones but his mature ones all of a sudden their digestive tract changed the earth tilted on its axis I'm fast-forwarding much of this of course the foliage in the leaves changed the barometric pressure and the earth become more volatile above which it could change and allow seasons to come on the Earth's great cataclysmic changes started moving on the globe of the earth Wow the seventh morning was paused so what is the Millennium the finger of the second atom reaches over resume we will walk out on the ashes of the wicked and when we do we'll look at what used to be Arizona for those of you I think we have some here today from Arizona and they walk out say wow this ain't Phoenix wait we have to bring our water from the Colorado River there's foliage everywhere there's leaves everywhere do you understand there's places in South America that have had not one inch of rain in over a hundred years the driest place on earth no rain since records have been kept but I saw that the other day and I said hold on rains coming because when the re IGN takes place our aian will follow your so maybe barren and dry today but if you can get the King to rain rain will fall oh I wish we could leave today I don't mind telling you sermons I guess it's hard on me I tell my physical and tell them it's a strain and all the study you go into it I'm just told man it's hard to come out from underneath this and walk out in the middle of hell again how can we ever be the same sitting at the table of our Lord I'm glad we don't have to wait actually to save this table I think we're at it now but you love him children don't you want to be there more than anything else this world God oh brother Donny you want to be a king you want to be a ruler I don't want to be nothing except just there if me and Carol live in the farthest place out if I'm the last house on the last row of the last run out in the middle of the Bering Strait if there's any bearing or straight left to be there will be wonderful to me I don't deserve to sit at his table I don't deserve to sit with you all how in the world would I ever compare to a man like David Abraham Isaac brother branham Luther Wesley or the mercy but if I can just be that praise God well I want me a mansion right next door to Jesus with that attitude I'm not sure you'll even be around if you think you're that special there's something wrong you need an adjustment grace helps us to realize none of us deserve it but it's what God Himself gave to us before the foundation of the world your Lord Jesus what can we say after such things or I believe it father I believe it's true Lord how how we need your help so bad to be able to live your word we don't want to just talk about it discuss it we don't want to debate and argue it we want to live here father be the kind of Christians as your word says that you're not ashamed to call them brethren that's what I want the majority of my life has done gone I've not been a great person and never will be I know that I don't have the makeup to be a great person but if I'm a saved person a person who is for him Oh Lord Jesus help me I don't have much that I could bring to you today all I have is me I'm not smart not intellectual don't have great wealth don't have a business Lord if you asked me for a million dollars I there's no way in the world if you ask me for way less than that there's no way I could give it to you if you asked me for our great personality I couldn't give you that either you asked me for a great mintage of a great family No so really I've very little that I could offer but I remember reading in the Bible one day that there was a little boy who skipped school his mama packed his lunch for him and told him to Guam school and bid good boy but somehow another that day you blessed a boy in his truancy he missed school but he attended one of Jesus means jesus told His disciples set set the people down and feed him they said Lord we ain't got enough so they go search around city by God anything that a boy said well I'm supposed to be in school I was going to eat just for lunch but I don't really what it could do but I'll give it to Jesus so they come back to Jesus and say Lord we've got this little boy's lunch Jesus looked at it it's enough or do you want my lunch got my breakfast and then are you what do you want if you get me you get all that if I keep it to myself I'll mess myself up on I'll ever run into life but if I can give it to you today Lord may each of us me and women boys girls maybe be able to give our all to you Lord we want to be there so bad Lord Jesus Lord I sit and stare you on this thing I just go to pining for heaven so bad I just get so homesick it makes me feel sad and heavy but then I'm saying what about this sister she's not where she needs to be what about this brother they're not where they need to be oh god bring the children is so we can go home father help us today Lord how many of you was me today would like to give Jesus your lunch is it work your mind your heart your hands your ability amen although we just want to commit it to you now we love in all of our hearts thank you Lord Jesus as we enter into this time father of Christmas time or had so commercialized and taken away from the spiritual aspect of it yet we know the Prophet preached a Christmas sermon every year talked about it so much every year so itself had a sacredness in his heart I think it can for us as well even he would wish the people Merry Christmas in' they would buy him a suit new suit every year so he held an element of it in respect and honor so weak today Lord Jesus we want that Christmas gift the one the first the only the original Christmas gift Jesus Christ not wrapped with pretty red bows and ribbons Santa Claus paper but the attribute of God wrapped in human flesh and when he come forth from Mary's womb and took the breath of life for the first time God breathed he who made breath he who made life took life the word breathed thank you Father you become that gift that we could be forgiven we as Adam of old accept that innocent lamb I don't understand how it all works but I know one thing it's your program and if you accept it I accept it if you say you'll accept the Lord Jesus in my place I will accept that atonement praise God be with us Lord we love your father praise God their chemistry sing a little bit that course I think brother Lou is gonna come o come let us adore him what you love him today with
