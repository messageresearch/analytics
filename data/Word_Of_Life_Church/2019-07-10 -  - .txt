amen the invitation to come and just so thankful Amen that we're here that you're here that God is here did you come with a need tonight do you believe we have the need meter amen he's in our midst why because we invited him to come and it comes where he's invited amen praise the Lord hallelujah if you have your Bible turn to the Book of Isaiah and then wood has turn straight to the scripture tonight Isaiah chapter 59 praise the Lord Isaiah chapter 59 and we just want to read from verse 16 and we'll read through verse 19 like to speak to you here tonight on a title I've given raising up the standard raising up the standard now y'all got to do me a favor here tonight because I'm not like your pastor I'm an evangelist I don't I can't preach 39 parts and then 50 parts of that 39th part I can't do that I got one service of which I probably have four or five parts but I got to fit it into one so don't make me lay a foundation and you get to just get right to the same page as me here tonight pull on the word from the very from the very word go a man and we'll get out of here tonight you believe that Amen just pull on the Word of God I have so much the Lord's just inspired me with and just was just waiting on the Lord and which way to go in what direction to taken I believe Amen we're just were just being obedient to the Lord here tonight Isaiah chapter 59 let's start at verse 16 and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zil as a cloak sounds like someone's going to war according to their deeds accordingly he will reap a fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him Lord Jesus were so grateful Lord here tonight for your word Lord that we can have a sure footing Lord in an age that's trembling and shaking a world that's trembling and and darkness Lord a world that's in fear of war a world that's in fear of the economy and stressed and pressured Lord but you've called a bride away and Lord you've spoken a word to that bride and that word is Shalom it is well be it rest be at peace there's no reason to be worried or stirred lord but you've given us that rest here tonight and we find it in your word Lord it's our portion we pray father you'd come and break the word of life to your children Lord would you inspire me Lord as I looked over these things Lord you've put upon my heart but God may it be more than just Lord a word that's passed from intellect to intellect but Lord let that word sow into the very souls and the hearts of your children tonight may you receive the glory Lord I pray in all things be with us we invite you now in Jesus name amen you can be seated this word that we come to standard that the scripture speaking of here in Isaiah and it says that the Lord shall raise up when the enemy comes rushing in like a flood the Spirit of God will raise up a standard against him this word standard is is such an important word in the age that we live in more than ever before because we're living in the age not of seed but you're living in the age of the maturing of that seed there was an there was a time even in this lady I see an age where things were in seed form in an infant stage but you're not living in that infant stage but we're actually right at the the culmination and the manifestation of all fruits and all seeds where the Bible says all seeds would come to maturity would come to fruition so we're living at the zenith or the precipice of God's kingdom and Satan's Kingdom we're living at the very precipice or the climax of God's purpose and Satan's purpose and you're living in an age where everything is claiming to be right we take this word standard and and here's what we know about the word of God and all the voices in the world there's only one standard that God has God does not have many standards he does not have many choices or ways that are right but what we know is that not everything that says it's right is actually right though there's there's different religions in the world that claim to have the right way and there's different people who have different approaches to that right way you have a world filled with denominations and denominational ideas and the opinions of men and what were ripe with in the age that we live in is the opinions of people oh boy opinions are just endless in the age we live in you can google there they do and what you're getting well from your google search result over a topic that you might google is different opinions from different intellectual minds or different camps of thinking or people with different ideas and the world is littered with opinions of people but there's only one opinion that matters and that's the opinion of the word there's not more than one right way as we live in a world that's so sympathetic to every opinion and so sympathetic to every moral and every idea and what people say is morality and it's based upon your opinion or how you were raised or the country you were born in but here's what we know there's only one right way out of all the voices that say they have the truth there's only one truth out of all the opinions that say they know what what God is there's only one God and he's not multiple ways he's only one way there's not more than one truth there's only one truth there's not more than one baptism there's only one baptism there's not more than one right way there's only one right way and we're living in a world to where everyone is trying to measure their own standard or use their own measuring line to to measure what morality is or what is right and what is wrong everyone has their own standard of how you should live or standard of how you should dress or standard of what a church is or standard of what a Christian is but there's only one standard and it can't be what the world is thinking you can't you say what is the measuring line I want to read you a quote here from brother Branham and this is this is just I believe just brings emphasis and the brothers have those quotes in scriptures if you want to display them brother Branham says out of the message the trial he says God must bring judgment upon the earth and God has to have something here a standard to judge the world by because it would be unjust in God to judge the world and the world knowing no standard to go by how many believes that's true the church is the standard which one is it the word God said he would judge the world by Jesus Christ he says in another place in the harvest time he says but he's going to judge the world and he's got to have some standard to judge by or he would be unjust to let us go now and live this life without a standard or to be judged who would be right where could you tell what was right there has to be a standard and everyone has their own standard every Church has their own standard the world has their own standard of what truth is they have their own standard of their own approach and you say should we use the world hardly so the world is ever-changing but the world is constantly modifying what they believe that there's no foundation anywhere on the world of what they believed about just 40 years ago and what they used to call wrong they now call right what they used to call right they now call wrong and old-fashioned and out of sink or out of touch with the common though the world that we live in today the world their standard of the world is constantly changing from one age to the next age they have no absolute the world has no type post and one day though the political view is one man then the next year it's a different political view and this politician share voted for this and and five years later they voted against it and a new interview and say well what change well you notice became more progressive in my thinking and I used to be under a different teaching or a different school of thought and and now I've modified what is it it's a different standard the world standard is constantly changing and let me say it's not just changing it's decaying its corrupting it's declining world's not getting better the world is getting worse so you can't use the world by a measuring line you say well then which one should we use the church hardly the church over the last hundred years has changed their standard the prophet of God said if you're going to use the church than what church should you use everyone reads the same Bible yet they come up with a different standard everyone reads the same history of the church and they come away with a different opinion about what the church is what the church was what the church should be doing what the church should be today the church is constantly denominational systems and religion it's constantly changing its standard its ever-changing the measuring line and you watch even just in religious circles and men who have stood for truth even just basic biblical truth and you take a man like TD jakes who for years was Pentecostal oneness and denounced the Trinity and and get it and believed in the oneness of God and then for years he had his ministry there and and a nanny told that but but this years later he was questioned on him and he was asked what do you believe and he was he was confronted on him what happened to TD jakes his ministry got larger and it got larger popularity became gray her pressure became greater and he caves into the pressure denounces the oneness and accepts the Trinity you say what was it his standard changed because his standard was the church his standard was what men said his standard is what opinion said his standard and this is what the liz is the condition that the world is in there's a constantly evolving standard that is changing constantly the church has watered the truth down that they have versions of the Bible even even the NIV of popularly read version not getting into translations I read from many different translations but you got to be careful in those translations even in the NIV to are just just multiple entire verses entire verses and the new in that in the book of Mark have been removed you go read the NIV and look at they I think it's in the in the book of Mark and it comes to you read verse 9 and verse 10 and there's a verse and verse 11 and there's a verse verse 12 there's verse verse 13 this has a number there's no words it just goes straight to verse 14 what is it it's an ever-changing world and an ever-changing standard and you're living in an age where now the standard has been loosed from morals of history now we don't take history of the church anymore but now people are literally creating their own standard their own view or their own opinion we're living in the age where the mind of man has been exalted to where the very thoughts of a human being are worshiped above what the Word of God says the book of Judges Judges chapter 21 verse 25 Judges speaks of a horrible time and then then those days of Israel notice what one verse says it says in those days there was no king in Israel and every man did that which was right in his own eyes because there was no king God had to send judges because people literally just live lives as they felt to live it everyone was right in their own eyes man became his own interpreter man becomes his own filter he doesn't have a tight post to go back to he doesn't have a footing the staff foundation to go to he doesn't have a word to go to you say well what what makes up your standards what makes up what you believe what makes up what what makes you what's right and what's wrong my brother and sister when you reject the word and you leave the standard that God gives you'll eventually leave this you'll go to this man and you'll follow his opinion and then you go to this preacher and this this but the Aegean you believe his opinion and then when you find an opinion you like better you go to his opinion and you're constantly evolving oh my brother that when you leave this word it's an ever plunging pit it's a bottomless pit of men's thinking and man's ideas until eventually you just believe what you want to believe and you live you say how are you living by what's right in my own eyes you become your own interpreter you become your own moral compass you become your own thinker now I know that different standards you take today if we were to poll every single one of you you'd have different standards of what you call a clean house you'd have different standards all of us would vary what a clean car is we'd all have different opinions of standard of what a good job is or how work should be done our standards are all a little different every single one of us personal standards you go over to another country and you live in another person's home eat their food you realize the standard that you have is not the same standard that they have the standard of cleanliness is different the standard of sanitation is different and you cringe at the thought of going into eating food because what is it your standard is not the same as their standard you were raised differently then maybe the home that you're in you were raised with different standards and everyone has a different opinion but my brother and my sister the reality is there's only one opinion there's only one truth I know this is so simple here tonight but I just want to emphasize it there's only one truth only one only one right way to approach God there's only one right way and God wasn't gonna take multiple choice you look at Cain and you look at Abel God wasn't gonna say well I had said both of you because you're both right in your own way you know Cain that looks good Abel that's actually read the Cain's is not bad either you know I think everyone's right and everyone's a champion everyone's a winner there are no losers we don't keep score at ball games anymore because everyone's a winner don't want to tell anyone but here's the reality there's a loser and there's a winner there's a right way there's a wrong way and God was only going to accept one way one truth one baptism he wasn't going to accept multiple choice there was one right way and today we have millions of ways and millions of opinions but listen to me brother what Christianity is based upon is that we earnestly contend for the faith that was one time delivered to the Saints one time it was delivered right it doesn't need change that doesn't need modified it doesn't need added to it doesn't need taken away from God only says to fin the word that I've sent you hallelujah let me say this you say I think this well what about this and this opinion people love given their opinions what they think but let me let me just give you as straight as I know how God doesn't care what you think I know that hurts our pride but God doesn't care what I think God doesn't care what you think we can give our opinion over something but there's only one word and that word is unchanging God said I'm gonna send a word and it's going to be an unchanging word our time may change the world may change politics may change countries and nations may change but I'm gonna give you a timeless truth I'm gonna give you an ageless word I'm gonna give you a word that was good for Paul and it was good for Silas it was good for Peter and it will be good for you too it'll never change it'll never decay don't never erode it will hold its power it will hold its strength to the endless ages to come it will not be a dynamic word it won't evolve dynamic meaning changing it won't evolve with my opinions or your opinions the word and the standard God says I'm going to give you is it going to matter how dark the age gets doesn't mean the standard changes people want to change the sander of the word because the age is darker and somehow we think that because the age gets darker the standard gets lower no let me give you it's the opposite the light gets brighter as the darkness thickens the light brightens oh my brother the brother Adam says this notice this brother branham says go to the next quote brother he says thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did it Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close he says if a man is born of the word being born again not of corruptible seed what was it it was an unchanging word it was a plumb line that was made to be straight and not to be changed not the attitude not to not to be taken away from not for us to give our opinion and your opinion that word opinions like a buzzword people love to say it well that was brother Brennan's opinion hmm a novel thought brother Brennan's opinion oh brother man we can't preach opinion you know he had certain things with him who's to say what was his opinion what wasn't his opinion what your opinion is in my opinion that was brother branham's opinion and I raised my kids by this opinion in that opinion and it's because I have a different opinion well let me tell you something I'm not here to preach that we should just follow all opinions and follow boy whatever brother ends opinion of is the hunting rifle or a good place to live or whatever it was but when it comes to the Word of God I think I'll take a man who was vindicated by the pillar of fires I think I'll take his opinion over any opinion that I have Alleluia what was gone sending when he sent the word it was a plumb line and that's why it's important that we keep it straight that we don't deviate from it that we don't differ from it but keep the Word of God straight my brother and my sister opinion doesn't bring life opinion doesn't bring the dead back to life the word brings life the word brings the dead back to life the word is the only thing that has power so keep the word straight whether Branham says notice this here he says if a man is born of the word being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever he will produce the word he will produce the word the fruit or works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed or life that's in him his works therefore will be scriptural because that's the see that's supposed to be planted you say what is the evidence of the holy spell ago say Amen to the Word of God but brother say it amen to the Word of God is not a verbal Eman this is saying Amen to the Word of God when your life produces the word you are saying a man to the word what was Mary's vindication it wasn't that she just said beat unto me but it was when she produced the word in her own life I want to say God let my life produce the fruit of the word in my life not an opinion not a Creed not an idea let my life produce the fruits of the spirit of god hallelujah let it be scriptural let it be a life that's produced by the seed that's in me can you say man here tonight he says there he was the matchless one notice this here he says there he was there he stands the matchless one and in his hand the sharp sword with two edges the Word of God and that word would judge us in the last day in fact that word is judging even now for it is the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart it cuts asunder the carnal from the spiritual it makes us living epistles read and known of all men I want to say God let the word judge my heart here tonight and make me a written epistle read and known of all men he says I know that works if a man fears that he might not please God and let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he will hear those words well done good and faithful servant I want to hear those words let him fulfill the Word of God in his life in other words don't just let it be a lip service don't just let you don't don't just be a professor Brennan said we have enough professors be a possessor be one who possesses the word that you profess he says the word of truth was the criterion then is the criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another plumb line as the world is going to be judged by one Christ Jesus even so it is going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he's making out let him do his James suggests look into the mirror of God's a word don't compare yourself to your brother or your sister or to this church or to that man or that ministry there's only one mirror there's only one standard and that's the word of the Living God what are we trying to be total in our life sub-2 not any man not any opinion to the word hallelujah let's look at this here this this just the Signet notice here in numbers chapter 1 verse 50 turn in your Bible if you have a Bible here tonight numbers chapter 1 verse 50 I want I want to show you something here when the enemy comes rushing in like a flood the Spirit of God raises up a standard against it notice what this standard was in the Bible it says here in numbers chapter 1 verse 50 it says but thou shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony numbers is a book that's going to list it's exactly what it means it's going to number the tribes of Israel the sons of Jacob it says Levites over the tabernacle and over all the vessels thereof and over all the things that belong to it they shall bear the tabernacle and and all the vessels thereof and they shall minister unto it and shall and camp round about the tabernacle and I want you to just Apollo see a brother if you want to put up the slides we have you can bring that up I want you to notice here what this meant when it said encamped around go to slide five if you have them what it meant when he said in camp around the tabernacle we know that Israel was encamped by numbers they were they were they were placed in a specific position this picture gives a perfect portrait of that of where that the Ark of the of the tabernacle the our the the the tabernacle the outer court the holiest of holies was at the center of the camp now notice here and keep reading in your Bible but keep this the slide up it says that they shall in camp round about the tabernacle that was the Levites place they were given to the ministerial duties they were to take care of the tabernacle to make sure the oil didn't go out in the candlestick they were taking care of the ministerial that sacrifices the duties of the priest and he says in verse 51 and when the tabernacle said it forward the Levites shall take it down when the tabernacle is to be pitched the Levites shall set it up and the stranger that cometh not shall be put to death verse 52 and the children of Israel shall pitch their tents notice this the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own camp and every man by his own standard that's what the scripture says every man shall pitch towards the tent by his own camp and by his own standard throughout their hosts know our numbers the neck very next chapter I'm number numbers chapter 2 verse 2 and every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard with the in sign of their father's house the in sign the signet the emblem they shall pitch by his own standard with the in sign of their father's house what was the in sign you see Israel was not going to just be dispersed all over the countryside with the tabernacle in the middle but God says there's going to be an order by which you live this isn't going to be just looking like a bunch of homeless people living out in tents and just scattered all across the mountain but God says there's going to be order you're going to be placed in a specific spot and he says each man Levi's nepto lie Benjamin you notice all of the brothers jail all of the sons of Jacob I sure Dan all of them was to have their own encampment and if you were under the sign or the emblem of Dan you camped under that emblem brother Branham says this he says the scripture says he says when that when the Spirit of God raises he says when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises a standard against him so when the enemy went out as the Anti Christ God sent a certain type of power out to meet him he says he went out again as a red horse rider another color another power another ministry God sent another one after him to combat it to hold his church what was it it was the spirits from the book for the creatures from the Book of Revelations chapter 4 the throne room of God what do you have around that throne you have four living creatures as revelations for Jarnell me Olive Baptist says I seen he had the face like unto a man and he's seen a creature with the face of a lion he seen a creature with the face of an ox and then he had a creature with the face of an eagle notice these brothers go to slide 1 these were the creatures that John sees and revelations he sees the lion the face of a lion and brother Adam says what was it it was the Spirit of God that God was sending the anointing of God that God was sending to combat the Antichrist spirit so he sees a lion you know Ezekiel sees the very same thing the difference with Ezekiel is and Ezekiel sees a will in the middle of a will he sees a moving sea of moving throne and you'll read the the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel says he falls in by the river of Chebar and falls in division and he sees the same thing John sees as John's looking in the throne room of God he sees four living creatures this lion the varying go to the next one brother he sees the lion he sees the man this was another anointing keep going he sees the Ox another anointing of Christ and then go to the next and brother then he sees the flying eagle and what were these these were the cygnets or the standards or the emblems that Israel was camping under brother Branham says that he says that is speaking of speaking this he said Dan was under the eagle anointing or Dan was under the eagle signet or the eagle standard so in Israel could keep going brother the very next slide it should be the same one we were at when Dan went when you see when they were camped about I want you to look here in numbers chapter 2 this is this is so amazing the scripture tells us that as Moses sees this images he's caught up into heaven and he sees this image of the house of God and God tells him build a tabernacle build it exactly like you've seen in the throne room not exactly like you've seen in heaven so what does Moses do he builds this tabernacle and then God says beyond that tabernacle I want you to pitch your tents Dan Asher neptulon Ephraim Reuben and all of them are going to have they're going to be called they're going to be placed under a different standard just like in an army today you have the different battalions you take the air force of them and the Marines or the army they all wear a different signet what is it it's a different standard it gives them tells them where they're to be positionally placed to stay in order and so God says Moses I want you to tell them and numbers two he says tell them to camp based on the in sign of their father's house so Judah the camp of Judah is going to consist of 74,000 people 84 it said of 74,000 under Judah under it's a car there's going to be 84 thousand people Zebulon is going to have fifty seven thousand four hundred people a total of 186 thousand men that worded that we're going to be camped to the east and all of them were to be under their standard under their cygnet what was this sand earn what was this signet Judah goes out first and guess what Judas signet is you could imagine a lion because the lion of the tribe of Judah he comes out of Jesus comes out of Judah of that tribe of Judah now notice Judas goes first he's going to be he's going to be under the standard of the lion and under Judah under that same standard is going to be is a card set belong who would come in behind Judah but under the same standard of a lion they were all camped under that emblem of a lion God does everything perfect no mistakes John sees creatures lion ox man eagle Ezekiel sees creatures lion ox man Eagle what are they their defenders their guards of the throne they're the guardians of the throne room I wish so bad we had time to preach on this tonight and we don't but they notice a need and when God drives out the man what is he placed in front of Eden cherubims with the flaming sword that went every way you remember that in the Bible that turned every way north south east west what were those cherubims doing they were guarding Eden Eden wasn't a place a geographical location that they were guarding they were guarding a condition that man fell from they were guarding an atmosphere that Adam had lost and now man is driven from Adams position and now there's cherubims guarding Guardians Ezekiel sees those same guardians to the throne room of God Ezekiel sees them the man that the Eagle the ox the and what is what is George ancien revelation when he says behold I've seen a throne and he says and surrounded the throne twenty-four elders what words the patriarchs and the disciples it was it was all in type of guardians what is Matthew Mark Luke and John guards of the throne of God and brother Branham said they all had a different anointing one was under the eagle one was under the Aswan was under the man what was it it was all God's Guardians defending the way back to Eden that's why you don't find the formula for South firfer the new birth in Matthew Mark Luke or John you find it in acts because they were guarding the way I don't want to lose that lose you in my thought here tonight but they were guarding the way so now what do you have you have Israel who's the only possessor of truth out of all the nations of the entire earth God does not say I'm going to choose Israel and I'm gonna choose the hittite and I'm gonna choose the the Egyptians and I'm gonna choose the Romans all right I am I gonna choose the pit the the the the hittites and the perizzites I'm gonna use the Canaanites and but I'm gonna use Israel too and I'm gonna have everyone's gonna have truth everyone's gonna be everyone's gonna be the ambassador of God no he chooses one little nation one elected family to be the ambassador of the truth to the entire world and what has God done in this age he's chosen one the little elected family of God and what are you you're the ambassador of truth to the entire world [Applause] he doesn't give the Canaanites the standard he gives it to Israel only Israel has the standard and they're all camped out under these this is how they're to Marxist is out there to in camp let's go a little bit further Rubin camps under the man the five what was that standard it was a flag it was a flagpole that they carried and under that flag if you were to see Israel's encampment in that day you would see those four flags you would see one camped under the lion and end under that campement under that under that flag under that banner would be Judah it's a car Zebulon and all of their families camped under that lion standard and then if you look to them to the west if you look to the west you'd see Reuben and under helm above his flag and the carriers of the flag you would see the face of a man and Reuben gathers under that flag noticed this the camp of Reuben has for forty six thousand five hundred people in it a lot of people and underneath Reuben under the same Cygnus Simeon with fifty nine thousand three hundred people and then GAD follows under the same banner the same standard the same anointing the same flag the same spirit GAD falls under the same with forty five thousand people a total camped under the man standard of one hundred and fifty one thousand four hundred and fifty men camped to the South Moses didn't make this up they surely didn't make this up you see people don't come under order automatically but actually your human nature automatically is in disorder you are not ordered by anything except someone making you discipline to bring order to your life let me say this my brother and my sister order does not come for the opinions of man order comes by the Word of God bringing order to your life you won't order in your home apply the Word of God to your home you will order in your family apply the word it brings order to your house people don't like order but God wants order God says Ezra you're going to camp this way and now notice this is this as you look under Reuben as he's camped under that signet and now you have Simeon and GAD under that same flag of a man then you have Levi who was Levi part of the ministry chosen by God the priesthood and where did they live in the middle at the Tabernacle that's where they camped they lived constantly for the needs of the people that's what a true minister is a true priest a true minister is not a sage on the stage whose elite and doesn't have time for anybody a true servant of God a true minister of God cares for the affairs of the people but what do you have in this age you have kingdom builders and men who wear crowns like kings and they got time for nobody and you got to come to their revelation you got to come to their church pay your tithes to them God never called those men God is calling servants of the king the almighty King the only King we have hallelujah notice under Ephraim Ephraim is going to receive the ox standard the standard of the Oxus flag after all of all all of his olivey friends people and Manasseh is going to be under that same exact standard Ephraim is going to consist of forty thousand five hundred people and Manasseh is going to be under that same standard with thirty two thousand two hundred people and Benjamin also will fall under that ox flag Benjamin will have thirty five thousand four hundred people totaling one Durotan 8100 men camped to the west you go further than that and what do you have you go further than that and you have Dan Dan's anointing his flag it's going to be the picture of a flying eagle and Dan's going to be under that anointing of an eagle dan is going to hat on under Dan he's going to have sixty two thousand seven hundred people Asher's going to fall under that same standard he's going to live under that same banner Asher is gonna have forty one thousand five hundred people and nepto lie is going to live under that same eagle standard depth Allah is going to have fifty three thousand four hundred people a total under the eagle anointing of one hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred men who are camped to the north you see for the map where did you get these numbers numbers that's why the books called numbers you say wise numbers important why did why did God fake it important because every name who is going to be called under that anointing God was going to have a specific name a specific person a specific army oh my brother God's family is not general and just generally speaking but he knows exactly how many people are in his army he has the elected numbered my brother and my sister you say I'm part of the elected family of God because God specifically chose you oh that ought to do something to your heart here tonight then no God God didn't to start picks that group God didn't look at a group of a hundred two hundred thousand whatever it is people and say I choose all the y'all but God by person-to-person chose specifically every individual who would have a seat at the throne room of God and I believe my name is in that has a seat at that table much children have a seat at that table my family have a seat at that table there won't be one empty chair because there won't be one extra seat at that marriage table that marriage table has exact number we don't know what that number is none of us know how many are thee and me and the elected family of God I know how many God says there's going to be some who live under the anointing of them of the lion there's going to be paul and silas and peter and that first age and god had a very specific number for the Ephesian age and when that final number came in what happened that age goes and the next age comes God knew exactly how many would come under the Ox anointing and have to give their lives as martyrs he knew the exact number of elected people that would be called under Martin Luther's message he knew exactly how many people would live in the days of John Wesley he knew exactly how many there were and my brother he knows exactly how many elected are called to this message we don't know how many but what are we doing we're searching till the last number he's at our table hallelujah God knows exactly who's elected and he won't lose one I'm so glad to know he won't lose any because he's already got him numbered he knew exactly how many would come under Wesley how many to come under Luther and he knows exactly how many is gonna be it under this anointing and you can't force someone under this anointing that's not called under this or not you may try and you may persuade and you may beg and say it's easy for me to see why can't you see it because you're called to live under this eagle flag and you can't force anyone to live under that flag only who God called he numbers all of Israel and they're to be encamped by their signet read it again in numbers chapter 2 and numbers chapter 1 he says that they shall the trim the measure shall pitch their tents every man by his own camp and every man by his own standard throughout their hosts what was it to the east to the west to the north to the south the Eagle the Ox the man the lion it was the ambassadors of truth to the entire world and guess what every time they traveled and they traveled a lot they had to pick up their camp pack it all up and march in their order no one was to get out of order no one was to get out of step if you were called to live under the Eagle anointing you can't go over to Dan you can't go over to the lion anointing lion flag endures they decide to pick up and move from this church to the other church my brother let me tell you something God's called you to a specific place a specific pastor of a Swiss Miss specific state a specific City and you could try to go live somewhere else it'll never work out God planted you in the place he called you to and you can only grow in that place that's why it's so important to find your position because you'll only be fruitful under that flag might have looked over at the next church you know Dan might have looked over and Dan might have seen you know it's a car and say you know I don't know I like the way he preaches a little bit better been streaming him lately you know I like like what he says I like their music a little better sort of getting sick and tired of the same old song same old song later same old music same old pastor same old preaching what are you doing you're trying to change your standard God called you under a standard he called you and put you in a certain place and God says be fruitful in that place I'll bless you in that land I'm calling order I'm calling you to a position and to a place I've called you under a certain anointing a certain standard and when you march Israel you have to stay in this order do you want to know what that order looked like from an aerial view go to the next slide brother here's what you had you had the Tabernacle in the center you had ephraim in the West you had Reuben in the South you had Dan in the north under the eagle yeah Judah around er the lion in the east go to the next slide this is what it looked like as they marched through the world it was the emblem of a cross what was it it was salvation to the rest of the world as they marched through life they were the ambassador of salvation Laurie what was in the middle of everything what was in the middle of all of their lives the holy spirit and my brother and my sister this was so important that the tabernacle was not at the front not at the back but at the center because the Holy Ghost should be at the center of everything you do everything you say everywhere you go every thought you think God says I I have a position you have a position what is God's place in your life at the center of everything else in your life should be the center should be Christ in Christ Oh I want to say Lord let me make you the center and as you march you have to march in this order no one break rank no one break position everyone has to march in this order four out of Judah I'll send a savior his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty God the everlasting father Prince of Peace Israel had no idea but they were literally the ambassador's who were carrying the very seed of God in that picture God has everything invested his entire plan do you realize that he couldn't just say sorry is her you failed you messed up I gotta choose someone else know he had banked everything he had invested everything in this one nation and they didn't know but they were very they were literally carrying the very plan thought purpose mystery of God didn't look like it all the time look like a mess most of the time looked rebellious hard-hearted calloused turned their back on God spinning God's face would go sinning in the world then come back to God repenting but yet inside of that earthen vessel was the treasure that God deposited oh my brother I don't always look like the vessel of the carrier of truth the God said I've banked and placed everything I put my very seed in your life do you realize you're the carrier of the plan and purpose of God God says I've placed it all in you as the scripture says that they without us cannot be made perfect we say brother Matt why is that important it's important that we hold the standard it's important that we raise the standard it's important that we don't drop the standard are you Anthony here tonight notice this as we go in just a little bit further brother Branham says listen now notice he says now this here Dan was an eagle Ruben was the man's face Ephraim is the ox you get the picture there's the way they camped in the Bible he says if you notice Dan as the head of three tribes shoot as the head of three tribes Ruben's the head of three tribes he frames the head of three tribes three four is twelve twelve tribes of Israel each with their own banner the banner of Judah was aligned the banner of Reuben man the banner of Ephraim an ox banner of Dan was an eagle and I look back at what John said one had the face of a lion the face of an eagle the face of a man notice the the face of a man the lion the ox the Eagle anointing he says let's hear read to see if it's not the same thing in heaven the first speech was a lion Judah second beast was a calf there's the young ox third beast was the face of the man the fourth beats the flying eagle just exactly the tribes of Israel camped around what were those Israel tribes they were guardians to what the tabernacle they were guard and that's why the Bible says if a stranger comes in he'll be put to death they were guarding what was it wasn't the beauty it wasn't the lights it wasn't the color God wasn't concerned about the curtains and the beads and the silver and the bells and the whistles that was not what they were guardians of they weren't guarding the Badger skin or the fine linen or the scarlet or the purple or the gold the Onyx the barrel the that the Topaz all of the precious stones that was all-important but do you realize what they were guarding they were guarding that cloud that you see right there in the middle because without that cloud all the beads and all the lights and all the all the whistles and all the colors meant nothing do you realize what your guardians of doesn't matter all your doctrine and all your theology oh you're teaching a God didn't send us a message so we could be puffed up in our head about how much we know about creation and how much we know about the revelation of God we're so smart and so intellectual and we just know we have all the secrets and that the secrets meant nothing if the life of God is not behind those secrets and mysteries you're not guardians of some intellectual knowledge or some pride electoral property or a software or a program or a tape or a book you're guardians of the very life and the so a Spirit of God we're the guardians of the way back to eternal life that spirit that pillar of fire that filled the tabernacle was what was so important to God as a whole other sermon we ain't got time for notice this is they go through this now notice each being camped under their own sign each being camped under their own sign let me just find my place here brother Branham says here I know that works he says I know that works now noticed this in this age God has given a sustainer let me just get back to some of this here today you're living in an age that is literally the Bible says is groping in darkness they don't know it they have they have no idea do you realize man thinks he's smarter than he's ever been before he thinks he's understood that we were living in the age of information they age what they call this age that we're living in where what but the Bible says you're blind miserable wretched poor naked I knowest it not behold thou say I'm rich increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest thou not brother Brennan said that wasn't arrogance he said they literally looked at their own self with their own human pride and said I'm perfect I'm all-knowing that age that we live in the Bible says they're groping in darkness when the world when they age the Information Age today people think they're more informed smarter than they've ever been before and you're living in the age of the Internet of Google of blogs the advent of the blog where a man could get on and take the fodder of his own mind and express my enough preaching against blogs here today I'm simply telling you it it should be a signal to something so our man has been given a platform to express what he thinks and the mind has been exalted human thought they've thought that all we need is intellect all we need is more knowledge more than ever before knowledge is increasing and then the Machine mine has been exalted to such a place we think it can it can cure all diseases it can't we think we could can conquer all problems it can't that the age in 2019 that we're living here today has the highest esteem of its own thinking it's the age of information as we said where you can just google anything and you think by what your results are giving you that you're gaining information and you're getting smarter and that could very well be the case you could be gaining intellect but most of what you're getting is the opinions of men opinions of women opinions and at the very end of all of their education all of their science all of their schooling it's just an opinion even medicine today is called practicing medicine and you're the guinea pig they're practicing on pharmaceutical drugs and a multi-billion dollar industry what are they doing their dis testing trying at the end of the day that they've solved I'm not not at all preaching against them but brother Adam said this he said civilization education it's always moving away from dependence on God and moving to dependence on self it's an age of self validation or man is literally worshiping his own thinking when they leave the truth oh what do we do we we just we were - we just use critical thinking the internet has produced an entire generation of know-it-alls adults not this children I know you thought I was talk about teenagers I'm talking about adults too I know our teenagers know it all I know they do I won't question him I know everything know everything I told my son that you teach it in the drive and they kept every time I'd correct something in his driving he'd say I know I know his first words I know I know in other words I hate that you're criticizing what I'm doing wrong I know I know I finally said Gideon stop saying I know he said I know I mean I said you keep saying I know I know I mean no I didn't mean to say that everyone knows everything in this age we're no one else we're living in the age of DIY some of y'all know what that is do it yourself I'm appreciative of DIY I use it to my own advantage sometimes DIY Google search something YouTube something how do you do it don't what do we live in we live in an age where people say I don't need a plumber people tell me that all the time I just will fix it myself I got on the internet I googled and I did this and I'm a fixer thankfully sometimes they do other times they're not successful and when they call me and say what how much is your hourly rate I say that all depends have you touched it yet because if you've tried to fix it yourself and I have to undo your fixing rates a little higher remember the mic you tried to fix it I don't need a plumber I can google it and I can fix this thing myself as I had a customer tell me one time as I walked into his house with the with with 440 gallons of water all over the floor because he thought he could install his own water heater guess what he couldn't he actually needed a plumber I don't need a electrician Oh I'd never say that buddy one thing I'm not that's whatever the opposite of an electrician is that's me I don't touch wires I don't need an electrician I can google it I can just google it know what Google Oh tell me what to do it's never wrong it's flawless it's like the gospel whatever it says has to be true I don't need a plumber I don't need a mechanic don't need to take my car to mechanic I can just fix it myself I don't need a pastor I don't need a pastor I can fix my own marriage self-help books I can Google how to have a better marriage I don't need I don't need you to fix my shooter I don't need a pastor to tell me how to live I can just Google I don't need a church because now I have a line Church yeah I'll preach it from down here that's okay I don't need a church I can do it myself you can do it all myself do you realize I know it's funny but I'm trying to get you to see something here you're living in the age where man the Bible said would become a lover of his own self and you're living in the climax and the maturity of that scripture don't need a church I can distri and the next you say I don't need a prophet but here's what the word says you're groping and darkness yet they think they're smarter than ever before the world thinks they're more successful than ever before they're more fulfilled than ever before but let me take the covers and expose the world today it is going insane it is declining and insanity it's more angry than it's ever been before it's fuen with wrath people are more confused and more lost and they've ever been before you're living in world that's more addicted than it's ever been before hooked on drugs hooked on alcohol hooked on pills a world that is totally insane this world is more broken than it's ever been because they've lost the standard of the word it's an age you say what is the age is the age of information but I ask you what is that age of information produced what is the age of the internet produced of people who are more addicted to pornography more addicted to drugs more addicted to popularity more addicted to entertainment keep going to the Mac don't stop there keep going keep going don't stop it entertainment because we love our entertainment but we're more addicted than we've ever been before we've kicked the television out and now we're more addicted to Netflix and Hulu and YouTube and whoa I know you'll know what those names are these mountains are big but they don't shield you from the world I promise more addicted to entertainment it's an age what is the information that are addicted to the Internet that's why it's called the World Wide Web because it draws you and pulls you and wraps you what's it produced it's produced more divorces more broken marriages more suicides and teens more depressed teens more depressed people depressed in relationships it's called more adultery and Men leaving their wives and women leaving their husbands than ever before it is gone completely insane I've said this and I'll say it again there's a difference when you use the internet and when the internet uses you and most of us are used and abused more broken homes that are more broken churches that are more confused fire of the Holy Ghost gone more than it's ever been before more stagnation and coldness in our churches less people at church more people at home I got a sin well what is it it's a it's it's giving it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil and what is it it's a standard that's been changed all my brother and my sister they think they have success because of their information and that information leads them from the message tells them that the messages are cold leads them to some other place where does it take them to addictions takes them to sin takes them to worldliness takes them to depression take some more closer and closer to the exaltation of number one they haven't found Jesus they found another Jesus the Jesus of their imagination the Jesus of their own standard or their own definition but he says here he says brother Adam says what was it it was a different standard can I just have just 10 more minutes of that be okay he says what was that it was all camped under a different standard notice this here brother you'll just follow me along in the in the quotes that you have up if you could go to those now brother Adam says what was it when the spirit when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises a standard against it so when the enemy went out as Anti Christ God sent a certain type of power out to meet him he went out again as a red horse rider another color let me just let me just find it here as they if you found it that that's paragraph 116 he says there it went again as a red horse rider another color another power another ministry I don't have all of these so just follow along as I as I read them another ministry he says God sent another one after him to combat it to hold his church that's what those standards were sent for that's why they were under an anointing of a lion to hold the church to hold elected he says he sent the third one God sent His Saints in his godson his Saint his sent his Antichrist spirit to file the church to combat the church what did God do God sent his he says he sent the fourth one God sent his fourth one and then the Antichrist in and the church ages in at that time watch he says hold this is really good we see that devil is changing for beasts meant what power they was revealed to or what power he revealed to the world how they ended up in this pail dead force he says let's look at God's powers of these beasts to combat them the first beast of God went out to meet the Antichrist the Antichrist spirit when it was in it's just it's teaching remember when a Christ first rode he was in a teaching ministry the Antichrist rode in their teaching ministry watch the one that went to meet him the lion the Lion of the tribe of Judah who were they under who was Paul under who was Peter under silver and gold have I none but such as I have give IV all of those spirits the lion the man the Eagle the ox they were all the Spirit of Christ they were the throne guards and those Guardian that spirit of that of God came upon the people brother Brennan says what was it let's look at God's powers he says watch the one the men who went to meet him the Lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word when his false teaching went forth the true word went to meeting that's the reason we had an Iranian and a Polycarp and those fellows a Saint Martin when the Antichrist was riding with his false teaching God sent his teaching out the word the Lion of the tribe of Judah why do you think the Apostle Paul could say when I came to you brethren I didn't common the power of my own intellect or man's wisdom but I came in the power and the demonstration what was Paul saying when I came to you it wasn't coming with a word of in electric combat intellect for intellect but God sent an anointing of a lion upon the church the Lion of the tribe of Judah to combat the Antichrist spirit I came unto you under the power of the Holy Ghost he said that's why they had to have him he says when the Anti Christ was riding with his false teaching God said his teaching the Lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word Mane manifests in the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to manifest himself which is the word that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles and visions that's the reason you mean it wasn't because of how dedicated they were wasn't because of how perfect they were wasn't because of how spotless they were wasn't because of how intellectual no that's the reason they had miracles signs wonders killings vision powers because a Living Word in the form of the Lion of the tribe of Judah rode through their lives anointed the lives of insufficient men anointing the lives of imperfect women in perfect teenagers people with mistakes and faults and failures but an anointing of God so filled their life that no devil in hell could stand before that first church because why the Living Word of God Oh hallelujah he says now the second beast went out was a red beast that he rode on was to take the place in the earth and war second one that when to combat him was the ox beats the Ox means labor beasts of burden if we gonna stop let me tell you just to be sure you see this that's the kind that might be a little puzzling and move on move on just pass this brother to the next quote that you have it's the very next line he says hey man now you got it he sends his power I love this he says he sends his power Antichrist God sends his word Antichrist false teaching the true cheat he went with it to combat it now that was the first one now this was the first church apostolic that went out to meet him keep going brother he says now notice this he says and another thing the Ox is also a beasts of sacrifice see they just gave their lives just as freely as they could give them in the Dark Ages a thousand years there that catholicism controlled the world they just gave their lives as freely as they could give them why they were under an anointing they gave their lives as freely as they can give them I love this he says they went out and died they didn't mind dying he says he says here they just went right in yes or no they didn't mind dying they didn't mind dying what did they did they not like their life did they not love their life like you loved yours and I love mine and there's nothing wrong with saying that you love life no one likes to die let me tell you something my brother my sister these people under the Ochs anointing and those dark ages were no different than you and me but something got ahold of their life something got ahold of these ordinary people they weren't morbid in their mind they loved their children they loved their lives they didn't want to die he says but they didn't mind dying if it was death that's all right they went and died anyhow why the very spirit of the what was it when they held a gun when that when they win the totem denounced Christ revealed Christ announced him denounced mrl will burn the house then with your children in it you say oh my what would I do in that situation of persecution game to such a point if persecution game to such a point tore they were gonna take my life oh I don't know what I could do you know why you don't know what you could do they didn't know what they could do either the difference is is that they were under an anointing of a standard that God had sent you're not under that anointing but they were under a power and let me say this my brother my sister was a power that was not within themself it was very much without of themselves it was very much a power that God had released to combat the Antichrist spirit and they willingly gave their life that's the reason I rainiest that's the reason go on Polycarp Paul John those great mighty men out there combating that thing Polycarp was fed to the Lions he says they know he was burned it was too late for them to turn a lion loose on the arena so they tore down a bathroom imagine this an old bathhouse there put him in their arena and burned him and on his road coming down he was walking with this head down the Roman centurion said you're an old man how well-respected Polycarp why don't you just announce so easy just announced this thing it's so simple I mean you know just announce it and God knows what you mean you know we link you know cross your fingers you know God God isn't gonna look at that Polycarp who cares what people say it you could always go back and repent you know Peter was restored to denied Christ no doubt the devil could say anything to polygon and he could put any thought and whisper anything in his mind here on oh man well respected why don't you just announce that thing he just kept looking towards heaven Oh glory to God can you see that st. there as the last brother Adam says he kept looking towards seven and I've always spoke from somewhere they couldn't understand where said Polycarp don't fear I'm with you why he was standing with that word they begin to pile boards on him to burning there was a heavenly music come down the anthems from some angelic somewhere sang the song he never even one time batted an eye to the skull fur that's gallant men that's men who could stand martyrs down through the ages they suffer terribly but what was they they were under the inspiration the Spirit of God the power of God they couldn't explain why they were living the way they were living Polycarp couldn't give you and take a chalkboard and draw it out all he knew was there was an anointing upon his life he must fulfill the word that God has put in his life because God sent an anointing upon his life you say how was Polycarp and overcomer the same way you're gonna be an overcomer now because of you not because of yourself but an anointing of an eagle that anoints your life to overcome the world the inspiration of God came upon his life now don't forget this church brethren on the tape I want you to examine this how could men do anything else besides the power of God that has been released released oh do we do we catch this my brother and my sister or are we catching our message our day and it's our are we catching it here today he says how could they do it apart from anything but the power of God that's going that's been released to them he says I'm gonna sit this box up here to represent that if God sends a spritzer and spirit among them that's the only thing they can work by you say were they possessed they were yes right answer or they possessed they were possessed of a spirit from another world they were possessed from a spirit that came directly from the throne room of God and entered into their heart you say how I could never do that I put myself in that position brother they couldn't have done it either apart from the power of God that God had sent to their life and you can't do anything you say how am I gonna what what's in front of us God isn't calling us to give our life at a stake or to be burned that's not the anointing that you're facing but a spirit has been released in this age from the Antichrist called a pale horse rider and that pale horse rider is a conglomeration a mixture of every spirit do you realize what you're facing every day when you woke up this morning it may have felt like an ordinary day but in another dimension every demon in hell was trying to afflict you and mess up your family and mess up your children and assault your mind and a soldier marriage every demon spirit was trying to affect you do we realize what we're facing my brother and my sister we're facing Satan's grand finale where he pulls out every play from the playbook where he pulls out every trick every scheme you're in the darkest age you're in the darkest time you're in a time of more confusion where world's going insane and Satan has every gun trained on you but God says what is God going to do to stand back and say figure it out you're just gonna have to figure it out no God says from the throne room of God I'm gonna send an eagle anointing to make you rise up out of the world rise up out of your depression rise up out of your trouble and fly into an atmosphere where there's peace and joy how can you say a man and happiness and love cut says I've got an anointing and just as much as Polycarp just as much as the the martyrs of the Dark Ages had no chance of overcoming the spirit of their age apart from an anointing neither do you have any chance unless you're under this eagle you see why it's so important to be under your anointing and God has a very specific anointing for this age and that creature is not a man we didn't get time to it but another age the brother Branham says what did God have to do he had a sentence in the spirit of a man a shrewdness and intellect that came to man but that's not the spirit you're under some people think that's what they're under the spirit of intellect and man and man followers and man worshipers and but that's not the spirit one under we're not following a man we're not looking to a man we're looking to an eagle the great eagle the mighty God unveiled and God said you gotta come under the anointing of the eagle if you want to rise above it I say tonight I want to rise above my problems I want above my troubles I want to rise does anybody want to rise here tonight say I want to come out of my depression come out of my my issue in my trial I want to fly into the heavenlies Oh somebody say praise the Lord here tonight I'm gonna fly above all my problems Oh stand to your feet here tonight say God give me that spirit to rise above it I don't care what that is for you tonight I don't care what problem you face or our issue that your minds going through right now God says I've got the spirit of a creature and he's not an earthbound creature he's a creature that can fly out of these atmospheres of negativity and trouble and sickness and worry he can rise into another happiness all you got to do is climb up on his wings I got to do is climb up on the swings and say Lord all right raise me up out of the trouble raise me up out of the problem raise my family my children out of Radio SIA bring them into a heavenly atmosphere Oh give the Lord a hand clap a phrase hear something hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Lord I want to rise above it here tonight as we raise our hands Lord across this beauty you've called us to raise up a standard and to hold that standard high to keep that flag raised that flag that had 19 Lord you sent us a prophet messenger under that eagle anointing and he could see Lord ahead you gave him vision a gift a message a word you gave him a word Lord a word that would meet the challenge of this day you've not asked us to give our opinion to add to take but you've called us to camp under that standard let us do that tonight Lord Lord if we fallen out of that encampment may we may be weary establish may we let the word reestablish asunder that anointing for this word has an anointing upon it Satan attacks it from every side from within from without from ministry from people from outsiders for I the Lord from every way from society we have every gun trained against us Lord but in this word is a power that will lift this bride off the earth someday one day Lord we're gonna take her flight like a mighty hero today Lord were living in Satan's Iduna ageless darker than ever before harder Lord today to discern right from wrong Co world mixed with opinions our own mixed with ideas all motivated by fear motivated by greed motivated by pride Lord but you've not called us to feed upon that but you've given us a word that we can feed upon Lord and then that word we can receive life and for a week we can raise the hands tonight you can raise them tonight and say Lord honey strength would you give me strength from that word I'm an eagle I'm feeding upon that word I don't want to feed on dead a carry and dead carcass somewhere I want to feed upon that word or I can receive strength for my journey or I can receive revelation when I need it I can receive help when I need it health when I need it Lord I pray that you'd grant that leave it's an every single person here tonight Lord may we realize Lord there's power in this word there's power being encamped in the right encampment you're calling us to march Lord calling us to move and stay in order stay in step don't get out of line don't start looking at the other church don't start looking at that which his brother Adam sees in that vision and he screams stay in line get back in line get back in step Oh God let me let me hi say that tonight Lord I want to get back in step I want to get back in line with your word oh god I'm gonna be marching to the to the right rhythm to the right tune to the right beat Granite Lord Jesus the Roman army was one of the most successful armies you study history Roman army was one of the most successful armies conquered the entire known world you notice what was different about the Roman army they all dressed the same they all look the same those Romans were different than everybody else there was strict uniformity they all had to wear the same clothing same hat same hair same everything everything had to be the same they were different than the rest of the world and their success was in their uniformity the unity that the Roman army had conquered the entire known world as we said part of their success was their communication they had trumpet blowers people that would blow a certain sound that would signal a different command was death he could be put to death if you blew the wrong uncertain sound that that trumpet player it was so important for him to blow the right tune because the entire army was dependent upon the sound that they heard from that trumpet the Bible says that if the trumpet blow an uncertain sound who can prepare himself to battle and this this Roman army was so unified in purpose they had a loyalty amongst them everywhere they went they wore the badge the signet they had a flag and on that flag was the face of Caesar they had a loyalty to their king and they all shared that common loyalty and that flag was always put before them to constantly be raised up to remind him you're not fighting for yourself you're fighting for a greater purpose a greater calls I know my brother that Roman army fought for a carnal purpose but today were part of an army and God has called us to a uniformity God has called us to be an army where we all look the same we all dress the we all speak the same language and we all have a banner a flag and there's a face on our flag and it's the face of our King and every time the prophet of God what would he do he would lift the name of Jesus he wouldn't lift the name of a man he wouldn't lift the name of an opinion but he would raise the name of Jesus to remind the army this is who you're fighting for that Roman army eventually found its demise and historians say that the main reason why the Roman army was defeated and the Romans fell was for one simple reason they changed their requirements for membership you see to be in the Roman army before you had to be a Roman citizen had to be you had to be born that's why Paul when he's before Festus in acts 25 okay and in the book of Acts where Paul since I'm a Roman by birth a citizen natural born citizen by birth it meant something to be born but when they changed their citizenship it allowed hired mercenaries from other countries to join the Roman army lasted for her for a long time but eventually what happened when you bro Outsiders into the Roman army they didn't all speak the same language so communication broke down not only that they weren't all loyal to Caesar but they were in that army for their own purposes and they allowed anybody to join the army and then what happened when they couldn't speak the same language confusion came and the army dispersed and fell apart my brother my sister don't you realize why it's so important that we don't change our method of membership and our method of membership into this army is not a book not shaking a preacher's hand not paying your ties but you've got to be born by the Holy Spirit that's the standard that God's given the church the only way in this army is to be born in this army and if you're not born you can be born again here tonight you can be born into that army it was an important thing that they kept the standard eventually the dress code changed the cygnets changed the standard change and that's what the devil is trying to attack in our generation as our standard the standard of the word a standard of holiness it's on an outright assault by the enemy yeah an outright a soul you take the civil war same way though but the Confederate Army though the Union Army they all had signet insignia they had a banner they had a sign that they had to hold they had a flag bearer and that flag bear if you go read history of the Civil War that man who bore the flag was one of the most outside of the general was one of the most important men in the army the flag bearer he also had the shortest life expectancy because the enemy trained their guns on the flag bearer because he bore the standard of the army what was his position his position was to show where the line was so you didn't get in front of the line so that you weren't behind the line his position was to bear the flag of the army of the battalion that they were in that was their purpose the flag was to bring position why did god senator eagle anointing to bring us to our position in the family of God and the most important role was the flag bearer because when when the fire when the shot started being fired and war got hot and smoke began to billow and men's minds as they were shell-shocked by the sound of cannons and smoke was everywhere and they hit the ground and the army was was scattered what did they do they looked up they were trying to find that flag because they knew if they could see the flag if they could see the standard they could get to the right position in the right place of the army but the devil knew if I could take out the stead the flag bearer if I could shoot the if I could take out the the standard-bearer the confusion will ensue and it'll bring mass in in the churches and mass confusion to the people that's why the devil is attacking our standard but here's my message tonight raise up the standard and hold your flag high I [Applause] want to say how many can say that here with me tonight Lord let me raise up my standard when the enemy
