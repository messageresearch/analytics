[0:00] paul wrote this that they would be
[0:02] without natural
[0:03] affection they'll be truth breakers and
[0:06] we looked at it last week
[0:07] that no no matter what you'd ever try to
[0:09] do to make peace with some people
[0:11] they just won't make it because they
[0:13] love to argue
[0:14] they love to fight they love to fuss and
[0:17] remember
[0:18] those people who persecute the elect of
[0:20] god
[0:21] cannot be elect themselves because
[0:24] elect cannot persecute elect
[0:28] it's totally impossible now you remember
[0:31] saul of tarsus was elect
[0:33] but he was not in elect position
[0:36] persecuting elect
[0:38] he was still lost he was unregenerate
[0:41] but you never find paul once he was
[0:43] quickened
[0:44] to the elect seat of god ever
[0:46] persecuting
[0:47] another elect member of the body of
[0:50] christ
[0:51] is that right so folks who want to make
[0:53] it hard on us
[0:55] folks who would look for every aspect to
[0:57] shut down our church
[0:59] folks that will look for every aspect by
[1:01] which
[1:02] they will be able to get us in some type
[1:04] of legal trouble or whatever more
[1:07] remember that is not the holy ghost that
[1:10] is an anointing
[1:11] from the devil himself well praise the
[1:15] lord
[1:16] now remember the lord jesus said that it
[1:18] would be that way
[1:19] that people would actually seek to kill
[1:22] you
[1:23] and think they were doing god a service
[1:26] i've told you over and over again i'll
[1:27] say it again tonight
[1:28] there are people in this message if they
[1:30] could get by with it would have already
[1:32] taken
[1:33] my life they hate me that bad if they
[1:35] thought they could get me
[1:37] assassinated and get it done was nobody
[1:40] tracing it back to them
[1:41] they would have already tried to do it
[1:43] now they wouldn't have been able to do
[1:45] it
[1:45] because i don't think my time on earth
[1:47] is done yet
[1:48] so that they might have shot me like
[1:50] with a 50 caliber machine gun
[1:52] and when i drunk a pepsi or whatever
[1:54] more i might have spurted out like a
[1:55] sieve in your kitchen
[1:57] but if it wasn't time for me to die
[1:59] they're not going to be able to kill me
[2:00] but that shows the wickedness and the
[2:03] evil hatred
[2:04] that is in people that we're dealing
[2:07] with at this time
[2:08] and remember most of those are not
[2:10] agnostics and infidels they just say oh
[2:12] they're a bunch of holy rollers
[2:13] just leave them alone but it's people
[2:15] that are anointed with
[2:17] a religious spirit and the church
[2:20] now remember whenever you go to getting
[2:22] around folks
[2:23] and they go to talking about somebody in
[2:25] the church or somebody else
[2:27] and they're going to say well now
[2:28] they're a good brother and they're a
[2:30] good sister
[2:31] oh my they're this and that and the
[2:33] other but ah
[2:36] now they're moving into the slandering
[2:39] gear now you see most of us
[2:43] would never accept just false and error
[2:46] and wrong and lies against a brother or
[2:48] sister that we love in the lord
[2:50] but slander will mix enough good
[2:53] that the person will try to convince you
[2:56] they're only telling you
[2:57] for your good to try to keep you from
[3:00] getting
[3:02] hurt of course most of us what we do
[3:06] we tend to repeat that slander ourselves
[3:10] i wonder how many lies we have told on
[3:13] people
[3:15] because somebody told us and we didn't
[3:17] dare check it out
[3:19] now remember whenever someone is telling
[3:21] you a story
[3:23] i've heard a lot of stories in my years
[3:26] of ministry
[3:28] and when it involves more than one
[3:30] person
[3:31] believe it or not i've always found out
[3:34] there's two sides but when we
[3:38] hear one side and make our judgment
[3:41] on one side you know what it proves you
[3:44] are a
[3:44] very foolish ignoramus
[3:49] i don't care if you're a preacher if
[3:50] you're a deacon i don't care who you are
[3:52] now if i look at you long enough i'll
[3:53] see your cheeks blushing
[3:55] some of you is blushing through your
[3:56] mask don't catch a mask on fire now
[4:02] you see this is one reason why we're not
[4:04] ready for the rapture
[4:06] because we accept lies we
[4:09] accept slander we accept gossip and the
[4:13] bible
[4:14] tells us how to accept rumors
[4:18] by witnesses but do many of us do it
[4:22] no why we think we're above the word
[4:27] well come on now happy valley don't get
[4:29] quiet on me
[4:30] but apparently we think we're above the
[4:32] word or we would take
[4:34] our closest friend to task if they told
[4:37] us something contrary to the pattern of
[4:39] the word
[4:41] wait a minute brother now according to
[4:43] the word aren't you supposed to have a
[4:44] witness or two witnesses to this and
[4:46] that's what the word says now look at
[4:49] one of the meanings that i found of this
[4:51] this word false accusers it is those who
[4:54] strive ever to ruin the character of
[4:57] others
[4:58] venting their malice by informing
[5:02] against
[5:02] and accusing others without any regard
[5:06] to the truth
[5:11] now listen what god said in the book of
[5:13] psalms again 101 verse 5
[5:15] who so privily slanderest his
[5:18] neighbor him while i cut off
[5:24] the word cut off is put to an end to
[5:27] destroy exterminate terminate
[5:32] be annihilated
[5:36] isn't it amazing how we smell cigarettes
[5:38] on somebody or
[5:39] alcohol or marijuana we'll throw them in
[5:42] the pits of hell
[5:46] and have a slandering tongue
[5:50] and think we're so holy and so righteous
[5:55] god himself will annihilate you
[6:01] now listen friend this is not something
[6:03] to play with
[6:05] this is what god said so for those who
[6:08] slander brother branham for those who
[6:12] slander
[6:13] his message for those who slander
[6:17] message preachers for those who slander
[6:21] the people of god they won't meet me
[6:24] they won't meet necessarily you they
[6:27] will meet god
[6:29] at the day of judgment and you know what
[6:32] god's going to do to them unless they
[6:34] repent and make it right god
[6:37] will annihilate them
