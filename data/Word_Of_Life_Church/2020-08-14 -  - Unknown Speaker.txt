TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let me just tell you this morning friends that will be the foolish virgin that do not assume the mark of the beast that will also be messaged people who've sat around and played church some of you that attend this church if you don't get on fire with god and get the baptism of the holy ghost you're going straight for the tribulation as sure as there's a god in heaven you're not going to go on the rapture just because you say you believe god sent a prophet you're not going in the rapture because you attend happy valley on the occasion you're going to have to go in the rapture because you are filled with the holy ghost and born again that's the only way you're going i don't have a ticket to be able to hand out to each one of you to give you a token in the rapture you're going because you're born of the spirit of god there will be thousands no doubt and message people that will wake up one day and realize they have played church to me they will be the worst category when the morning finally arrives and it dawns on them that they had missed the rapture whenever they look around the pastor's gone and mama's gone and this one's gone and that one's gone and they go to trial and telling the people of the world they're gonna think they're absolutely nuts they're not gonna believe the rapture's taking place because they're preachers still here and the denominational people how long will it take before some of the message people are able to convince these others a week a month six months that the rapture has finally come and they have missed it i don't know because i don't plan on being around i want to be filled with the holy ghost right now let me tell you something this morning friend i'm not waiting for the eclipse that's going to come in august i'm not waiting for the solar pattern to come on september the 21st and strike over jerusalem i'm ready right now this morning not only that but let me go on and say i live ready every day of my life how many years with me you live ready you don't have to wait to come to sunday to get right with god you stay right every day and if you make a mistake and you do something wrong you simply repent of it and ask god to take it out of your life because if you are filled with the holy ghost you know it could be at any moment it could be at any time oh brother donny i'm waiting for this sign and that sign you'll never catch it the bride does not live by such a way the bride lives by love not by looking for signs not by reading a newspaper looking for a new website that prophetically tells you when he's coming nobody knows when he's coming but yet the spirit of god in us will keep us aware and ready and alarmed amen do you believe it the world wants to try to rock us to sleep and get us to where we're complacent and cold and indifferent and light delay of the sins but for myself i refuse to be cold in this hour i refuse to be lukewarm i'm going to be on fire why because i can be i can be i don't need a vote i don't need an approval i don't need none of your approval and you don't need mine if i want to be on fire with god i can be on fire with god if i want to be in love with jesus christ i can be it so i just think i will well glory i said i just said i will [Applause] there again you see that comes from the approach of your mind of what you think you can be or what you want to be if you desire to be lukewarm certainly your desire is your option to be so if you want to be complacent you can be so if you desire if you can desire to be it i desire not to
