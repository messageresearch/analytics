[0:00] [Music]
[0:34] let me tell you a story about a man a
[0:37] good man a family man oh he was not a
[0:40] scrooge he was kind generous and upright
[0:44] in his dealings with others but he just
[0:46] didn't believe all that Incarnation
[0:49] stuff which the churches Proclaim at
[0:51] Christmas time it just didn't make sense
[0:54] and he was too honest to pretend
[0:57] otherwise he just couldn't swallow the
[1:00] Jesus story about God coming to Earth as
[1:04] a
[1:05] man I'm truly sorry to distress you he
[1:08] told his wife but I'm not going with you
[1:10] to church this Christmas Eve he said
[1:13] he'd feel like a hypocrite that he'd
[1:15] much rather just stay at home but that
[1:17] he would wait up for them shortly after
[1:21] the family drove away in the car snow
[1:23] began to
[1:24] fall as he sat in his Fireside chair and
[1:28] read the newspaper he he was startled by
[1:31] a thudding sound and then another and
[1:34] then another at first he thought someone
[1:37] must be throwing snowballs against the
[1:40] house but when he went to the front door
[1:42] to investigate he found a flock of birds
[1:46] huddled miserably in the snow they had
[1:49] been caught in the storm and in a
[1:52] desperate search for shelter had tried
[1:55] to fly through his living room window
[1:58] well he couldn't let those poor
[2:00] creatures just live here and freeze so
[2:02] he remembered the barn where his
[2:04] children stabled their Pony quickly he
[2:08] put on a coat and gashes and tramped
[2:10] through the deepening snow to the barn
[2:13] he opened the doors wide and turned on a
[2:16] light so the birds would know the way in
[2:20] but the birds did not come in he figured
[2:24] food would entice them so he hurried
[2:26] back to the house fetched breadcrumbs
[2:28] and sprinkled them on the snow making a
[2:31] trail to the yellow lighted wide open
[2:34] doorway of the stable but to his dismay
[2:38] the birds ignored the
[2:41] breadcrumbs he tried catching them he
[2:44] tried shooing them into the barn by
[2:46] walking around them and waving his arms
[2:49] but instead they scattered in every
[2:52] direction except into the warm lighted
[2:56] barn and then he realized
[3:00] they were afraid of him to them he
[3:03] reasoned I'm a strange and terrifying
[3:06] Creature if only I could think of some
[3:08] way to let them know that they can trust
[3:11] me that I'm not trying to hurt them but
[3:13] to help them but how and he thought to
[3:17] himself if only I could be a bird and
[3:21] talk to them and mingle with them and
[3:23] speak their language and tell them not
[3:25] to be afraid then I could show them the
[3:28] way to the safe
[3:30] warm
[3:33] barn but I would have to be one of them
[3:38] so they could see and hear and
[3:46] understand at that moment the church
[3:49] bells began to
[3:51] ring the sound reached his ears above
[3:54] the sounds of the
[3:56] wind and he stood there listening to the
[4:00] bells peeling the Glad Tidings of
[4:05] Christmas and he sang to his knees in
[4:09] the snow

[44:17] I just want to say wow good job just
[44:20] want to encourage them to just keep
[44:22] singing because we certainly enjoy it
[44:25] don't we let's give them another hand
[44:26] this
[44:33] morning the just wanted to present these
[44:36] two cards to brother Donnie sister Carol
[44:38] the church has got him something little
[44:39] something for Christmas this year and
[44:41] just want to give this to them and tell
[44:43] them how much we appreciate them and I
[44:45] know all of you feel the same way this
[44:47] morning amen let's just give them a hand
[44:50] as turn the Serv
[45:02] where would we be if it wasn't
[45:04] for the true meaning of
[45:08] Christmas we know what we've been saying
[45:10] in the last several weeks and what we'll
[45:13] see for the rest of this week is not
[45:15] really what Christmas is all
[45:17] about and I'm so grateful that we as
[45:20] Christians can be able to separate all
[45:24] the nonsense away from the true meaning
[45:27] of it the true meaning is that he came
[45:30] to bring back the
[45:34] leadership of eternal
[45:37] life the
[45:39] leadership of eternal life that we would
[45:42] be able to follow him and serve him for
[45:46] our father in the Garden of Eden
[45:49] forfeited all of our rights our right to
[45:53] life our right to peace our right to Joy
[45:58] so many of our rights but the true
[46:00] meaning of Christmas is he came to
[46:03] restore all of those rights back and for
[46:06] that we are grateful are we
[46:09] not I want to speak to you today on a
[46:12] very unconventional Christmas
[46:15] sermon y'all are surprised right this is
[46:19] the same guy that preaches Christmas and
[46:22] Sodom so what can I say first First
[46:27] Kings 13:
[46:29] 6 I really don't think there's anything
[46:31] that I could bring to you today that
[46:33] would be more beneficial to all of us
[46:37] than being able to be in the divine
[46:40] order of God for our
[46:42] life again that's what I think Christmas
[46:45] is about is to place us back in that
[46:49] divine order and we know that it will
[46:51] not be consummated or completed of
[46:54] course until we get with him at that day
[46:56] but
[46:57] I truly believe there's an order for us
[46:59] here now First Kings 13: 6 what we like
[47:04] to read today is to me one of the more
[47:09] unusual and sometimes more difficult
[47:13] instances to understand in the Old
[47:17] Testament but it concerns the will of
[47:20] God for each of our
[47:22] lives our story opens up with a man of
[47:25] God that is sent
[47:27] to stand against the heathenism and the
[47:31] idolatry which has been brought into
[47:34] Israel and this man of God makes a
[47:37] pronunciation of what God is going to do
[47:41] and um God does that the king Rebels
[47:45] against him and God causes his hand to
[47:49] wither up so then the man of God is
[47:54] asked verse six and the King answered
[47:57] and said unto the man of God entreat now
[48:00] the face of the Lord thy God cu the king
[48:03] got really angry because this man of God
[48:07] had blasted
[48:09] idolatry and he says pray for me that my
[48:14] hand may be restored me
[48:18] again and the man of God besought the
[48:21] Lord listen now and the King's hand was
[48:26] re restored so we're talking about a
[48:29] true man of God that can speak
[48:33] prophecy speak the word of the Lord
[48:36] which was not written so he didn't have
[48:39] a reference to go back to and said well
[48:41] the Bible says the scripture says but
[48:44] there was no reference actually that
[48:46] said what this man said so it happened
[48:49] exactly as he said he describ the ashes
[48:51] and the different things that would
[48:52] happen there at the altar and now he's
[48:56] being sought after by this King for God
[48:59] to restore his hand the man of God
[49:01] besought the Lord and the King's hand
[49:03] was restored him again and became as it
[49:07] was
[49:08] before and the King said unto the man of
[49:11] God come home with me and refresh
[49:16] thyself and I will give thee a reward
[49:21] and the man of God said unto the king if
[49:23] thou Willl give me half thy
[49:27] house I will not go in with thee neither
[49:31] will I eat bread nor drink water in this
[49:35] place for so it was charged me by the
[49:40] word of the Lord now listen carefully so
[49:45] now God gives him a word to say to
[49:48] Israel on their idolatry but God also
[49:51] gives him a
[49:53] word now listen what the word was to him
[49:57] so it was charged me by the word of the
[49:59] Lord
[50:01] saying eat no bread nor drink water or
[50:06] turn again by the same
[50:08] way that thou
[50:10] camest so he went another way and return
[50:14] not by the way that he came to bethl I
[50:19] may let to be remembered today as we
[50:21] pray God bless each of you just hold
[50:23] that request in your
[50:25] heart Heavenly Father father it is such
[50:27] a great honor for us to be here again
[50:29] today in your place your house that we
[50:33] have built Lord that we could come
[50:36] together and sing and worship and pray
[50:38] and pray for your sick children that we
[50:42] could be admonished that we could be
[50:45] corrected so Lord here we have come
[50:47] again and for that very purpose we want
[50:50] to bring our
[50:53] sacrifices I know your Prophet has
[50:55] taught us that
[50:57] in the Old Testament the sacrifice must
[51:00] be brought to the right
[51:02] place so now you've given the world a
[51:06] sacrifice 2,000 years
[51:09] ago they reflect what they think about
[51:13] that
[51:14] Sacrifice by the place they take the
[51:18] sacrifice
[51:20] to so Lord Jesus the greatest honor that
[51:23] we could do back to you is bring you
[51:28] back to the house of
[51:30] God so people who take you to a system
[51:34] to church anity to all kinds of things
[51:37] like that it shows what they think about
[51:41] you so now we want to bring it from the
[51:44] churches of the denominations and so on
[51:47] and we want to bring it to us today and
[51:50] ask this simple question so where are we
[51:53] taking the original the true and the
[51:57] only Christmas gift what are we doing
[52:01] with it that will tell what we think
[52:04] about it Lord so help us today that we
[52:07] can bring you back to the house of God
[52:12] With Us and there we will worship there
[52:15] we will assemble there we will be
[52:18] blessed together change our lives about
[52:21] what we hear today Father we pray in the
[52:24] name of Jesus and the Saints said amen
[52:28] God bless you you may be
[52:32] seated as many of you already know being
[52:35] children of God after we become truly
[52:38] converted and filled with the Holy Ghost
[52:40] and our soul is sealed in the presence
[52:43] of God and there's not one more thing
[52:45] the devil can ever do to pull our soul
[52:49] out of that Divine
[52:51] Fellowship but he still constantly tries
[52:55] to get our Spirit get our flesh our mind
[53:00] our time so many things around us in the
[53:03] Natural Life get us so caught up just in
[53:07] the things of life itself and sometimes
[53:10] things are not sin necessarily of thems
[53:14] but it has to do with the amount of time
[53:17] that we would give toward those things
[53:20] whether they would become sin or not and
[53:23] the will of God is one of the most
[53:25] important things of our life how many
[53:27] believes that we looked at it last
[53:30] Sunday that there is a permissive will
[53:32] of God and there is a perfect will of
[53:35] God and the prophet has taught us that
[53:38] what we should strive for and seek after
[53:41] is that perfect will of God and our
[53:44] lives now we know we're born in the
[53:46] permissive will of God we understand
[53:48] that but God has made a way by the new
[53:51] births that we can walk in that perfect
[53:54] will of God for our lives lives here in
[53:57] in this space of time and we looked at a
[54:00] couple of different instances in the Old
[54:02] Testament and one of them was balam and
[54:05] Moses of course and I'd like to pick up
[54:07] on that again today before we go back to
[54:09] the man of God in Kings and the prophet
[54:12] says it this way notice as God said to
[54:14] balam after you heard the true cut
[54:17] decision word true cut decision word
[54:20] don't go yes then he told him after he
[54:23] had seen in his heart what it was to do
[54:27] he give him his permissive will so he
[54:30] said go and you can do the same thing if
[54:35] you don't want to walk in the truth you
[54:38] can go and have a great ministry can you
[54:42] imagine now a person that would have a
[54:46] great ministry and yet working in the
[54:50] permissive will of God and the reason of
[54:53] this is because that people sing bless
[54:56] blings somehow are always God's Divine
[55:00] approval but God's approval is when we
[55:04] walk in harmony with his word and the
[55:07] church said you can go and have a have a
[55:10] great ministry certainly you can but
[55:13] you're taking his permissive will you're
[55:16] walking over his word he'll Prosper you
[55:20] wow you imagine that God prospers people
[55:24] even when they're not in his perfect
[55:26] will he'll Prosper you certainly just
[55:29] like he did balum he was a
[55:33] success now we would think my goodness
[55:36] that God blesses us and that we are
[55:39] successful that must be the signs of
[55:42] God's approval of everything that we're
[55:45] doing in our lives but God's approval is
[55:48] when we keep his word is that right now
[55:52] notice he says he'll Prosper you just
[55:54] like he did balum he was a success but
[55:58] he couldn't curse that people he
[56:00] couldn't do it cuz every time he started
[56:02] to curse he blessed so God used the gift
[56:05] that was there in him see he couldn't do
[56:07] it but when it come to being prosperous
[56:10] in his achievement he taught those
[56:13] people through baac to commit adultery
[56:16] so he actually was a success yet he
[56:19] grants you permission for you to make or
[56:23] permit your will
[56:26] right your will a permissive will
[56:30] knowing what's in your heart now this is
[56:34] exactly what took place in the Garden of
[56:37] Eden this is what took place when Adam
[56:41] overrode the will of God God told him
[56:44] what to do and we know that Eve was the
[56:47] first one of course to do it Adam
[56:49] stepped out to take take cover for her
[56:52] but he knew all along what he was doing
[56:55] and he believed that his love for her he
[56:59] could not make it without her he could
[57:02] not survive without her he knew he had
[57:04] another rib but he didn't have any more
[57:07] feminist spirit inside of his spirit so
[57:11] what is he going to do live the rest of
[57:13] his life in the Garden of Eden without a
[57:15] helpmate and Adam was totally
[57:19] overwhelmed and he decided he could not
[57:22] do it then what does Adam do Adam moves
[57:26] over into his own will about the program
[57:32] of God now he doesn't understand maybe
[57:35] what God's going to do he doesn't
[57:37] understand about Redemption he didn't
[57:39] need it before he didn't understand
[57:41] about
[57:42] reconciliation but no doubt believing he
[57:44] was a Son of God somehow he must have
[57:48] thought my father will not cast me aside
[57:53] somehow he will make a way for me to be
[57:57] brought back oh little did he know all
[58:01] that he would bring upon himself and
[58:03] upon all the billions of people that
[58:06] would live after him now it was in his
[58:09] heart because he loved her so it was
[58:13] emotional human love that he loved for
[58:17] her now watch he said oh my brother
[58:20] brandom I do so and so it don't bother
[58:23] me God blesses me every day I sing in
[58:27] the spirit I dance in the spirit he'll
[58:31] permit it go ahead that's right but what
[58:35] are you going to do I wear shorts I do
[58:39] this it don't bother me I know my faith
[58:43] is in Christ not in what I wear boy
[58:47] that's a common saying of the day isn't
[58:49] it but the Bible said there is something
[58:51] to it what will you do you'll make a
[58:54] stumbling block like balum did you'll
[58:58] make a stumbling block like balum did
[59:02] before every one of the other women what
[59:05] you'll do to your young girls so you
[59:08] older sisters remember that when you're
[59:11] dressing in a certain way that might be
[59:14] questionable remember it's not just your
[59:18] right as a daughter of God well it's my
[59:21] right to do this and do that and the
[59:23] other but remember you can affect others
[59:26] that you're going to church with others
[59:28] in your family as well you'll have a
[59:32] bunch of rickettes that's exactly right
[59:35] a bunch of little painted up Jezebels
[59:38] but God will prosper you why He blesses
[59:44] me I don't doubt that he blessed balum
[59:48] too he certainly will you walk in his
[59:51] permissive will not his perfect will God
[59:56] God doesn't change his mind cuse He
[1:00:00] blesses
[1:00:02] you he blessed Israel right out there
[1:00:05] for 40 years what did they do married
[1:00:09] wives raised families kiss the children
[1:00:12] paid their TI lived right out there God
[1:00:15] blessed them in the wilderness fed them
[1:00:17] with a mana on and on and every one of
[1:00:21] them
[1:00:23] perished I don't want just God's
[1:00:26] blessings on our church I don't want God
[1:00:30] just to heal the sick we believe in that
[1:00:33] do we not we've seen him do so many
[1:00:36] signs and wonders and miracles but many
[1:00:40] will stand before the Lord that day and
[1:00:42] say the same thing probably many of you
[1:00:46] are not familiar with the groups in
[1:00:51] Pentecost that was
[1:00:53] identified as snake handlers any of
[1:00:56] y'all heard of them you've probably
[1:00:57] heard of some some of the greatest
[1:01:00] Miracles that I ever heard about in the
[1:01:04] Pentecostal ranks that I was in was
[1:01:07] snake handling preachers they would
[1:01:10] handle rattles snakes
[1:01:13] copperheads all types of poisonous
[1:01:16] snakes rare snakes that was snuck in the
[1:01:20] United States they were handled by them
[1:01:24] they would hold them up like this and
[1:01:26] shout and speak in tongues and worship
[1:01:29] God basically worshiping this serpent if
[1:01:32] you ever seen any pictures of them and
[1:01:35] yet they would have phenomenal miracles
[1:01:39] in their services I'm talking about the
[1:01:41] lame would walk the deaf ears would come
[1:01:44] open the blind would see some of the
[1:01:47] greatest Miracles I ever heard about in
[1:01:50] Pentecost was in them Services they
[1:01:52] would take bottles of strick none
[1:01:56] and when they would get under the
[1:01:58] anointing and the music would go to play
[1:02:01] in real fast they would take the lid off
[1:02:05] of that strick nine and drink it and
[1:02:08] keep right on preaching many of them
[1:02:10] oldtimers had pot belly stoves that they
[1:02:14] use for heat I've actually seen that
[1:02:16] done in my uncle's Church which wasn't a
[1:02:19] snake Handler and they would get them
[1:02:21] pot belly stoves red hot and take their
[1:02:25] hands and lay right on them stoves and
[1:02:29] never have one burn on their hands so
[1:02:33] you see for those who think that just
[1:02:37] the Supernatural is what proves they are
[1:02:40] right in their Doctrine you need to read
[1:02:43] a little bit farther in the book signs
[1:02:46] and wonders are Miracles but that does
[1:02:49] not mean that God is approving of
[1:02:52] everything that we are doing now why
[1:02:55] would it be thus among them and I worked
[1:02:57] with some different preachers and they
[1:02:59] had signs and wonders too but the more
[1:03:02] phenomenal for whatever reason I don't
[1:03:05] if you know it or not there's only one
[1:03:06] state left in our Union which still
[1:03:09] actually legalizes serpent Handling West
[1:03:13] Virginia all the rest of them are
[1:03:15] illegal and yet there are some that
[1:03:18] still do it and they risk being arrested
[1:03:21] and Carol and I saw a documentary just
[1:03:23] the other day of a serpent handling
[1:03:25] church and West Virginia in a place
[1:03:27] called War West Virginia some of you
[1:03:29] know where it's at if you don't you're
[1:03:30] better off anyway anyway going there to
[1:03:33] war West Virginia and there there's a
[1:03:35] serpent handling church there and the
[1:03:37] man who is the pastor now his father was
[1:03:40] a serpent handling preacher he died by
[1:03:43] handling serpents his brother then took
[1:03:46] the church he also got bit and died down
[1:03:49] in the church the church around him
[1:03:51] praying for him his blood coagulating
[1:03:54] the man basically pret in blood all over
[1:03:57] the church until the man died and
[1:03:59] according to them died in face now his
[1:04:02] brother is the pastor of the church and
[1:04:05] doing exactly the same thing and no
[1:04:07] doubt die the same way now you tell me
[1:04:11] that God call them people to hand handle
[1:04:14] snakes like that I believe in handling
[1:04:18] snakes but I believe in handling them
[1:04:21] the way Paul did now we have examples in
[1:04:25] the new test Testament of the
[1:04:26] Fulfillment of Mark 16 do we not and
[1:04:30] they did not pick up a rattlesnake or a
[1:04:33] copperhead or a Viper of some sort and
[1:04:36] hold it up and handle them outfits I'll
[1:04:39] tell you to me in my opinion the only
[1:04:42] good snake is a dead one I don't care if
[1:04:45] they're black green yellow purple they
[1:04:47] all cause heart attacks as far as I'm
[1:04:49] concerned well praise the Lord so I have
[1:04:53] no plans on handling snakes but if if I
[1:04:55] was to be ever marooned out all an
[1:04:59] island and I was picking up firewood and
[1:05:01] one bit me I believe I've got enough
[1:05:04] Faith to shake that Rascal in the fire
[1:05:06] and say get behind me Satan that was the
[1:05:09] Fulfillment of what the Lord said so
[1:05:12] what then do we see which this stem from
[1:05:15] a man very ignorant man as far as really
[1:05:18] understanding the scripture back in the
[1:05:20] 1940s and then it come from there only
[1:05:23] affected a small minority of people but
[1:05:25] one reason that Drew their attention so
[1:05:28] much was the supernatural because they
[1:05:31] saw such signs and wonders and miracles
[1:05:35] then what did they do they moved over
[1:05:37] into the permissive will of God God
[1:05:40] never allocated any of his children to
[1:05:44] pick up a Viper and handle it I've
[1:05:46] handled a few snakes before on the end
[1:05:48] of a hole handle that's the way I like
[1:05:50] to handle them myself good long hoe Cho
[1:05:53] that head off I was down my brother him
[1:05:55] several years ago he was out showing me
[1:05:58] around his pasture and this and that and
[1:06:00] the other and a snake come up there he
[1:06:02] went over and grabbed a hold of a hole
[1:06:04] cut that thing he said may he Rest In
[1:06:07] Pieces and there we had him a little
[1:06:09] funeral service I guess you would say so
[1:06:11] to me that's the way I'm going to handle
[1:06:13] them but look how people can move into
[1:06:17] the permissive will of God and think
[1:06:19] they are operating behind the scripture
[1:06:22] now you and I would sit and look at that
[1:06:24] today and say it's Absolut absolutely
[1:06:26] terrible and we would say Lord what a
[1:06:28] reproach well I wonder what about us oh
[1:06:32] we wouldn't handle snakes and we
[1:06:33] wouldn't dare drink no strict nine or
[1:06:35] nothing like that but what about our own
[1:06:38] lives whenever we step over the revealed
[1:06:40] word of this hour and somehow we think
[1:06:44] God blesses us anyhow now don't tell me
[1:06:46] I'm going to have to preach and say Amen
[1:06:48] both now watch what the prophet said
[1:06:51] here about them every one of them perish
[1:06:54] because they never kept his original but
[1:06:57] permissive his original will his word
[1:07:00] they took his permissive way now we
[1:07:04] don't want that right notice again he
[1:07:06] says so remember friend as long as you
[1:07:08] live don't never forget this God doesn't
[1:07:10] change his mind yet he will bless he
[1:07:13] will let you go his permissive will but
[1:07:16] he won't change his mind now let's turn
[1:07:18] back if we can to the book of First
[1:07:20] Kings again and let's read about this
[1:07:22] man of God first Kings chap 13 ver verse
[1:07:25] 11 now there dwelt an old Prophet now
[1:07:30] notice the devil tried this man of God
[1:07:33] by a king to get him to break the word
[1:07:37] of the Lord which was his portion of the
[1:07:40] word now he was not an ad alter this man
[1:07:43] of God was not and he was not going to
[1:07:45] fall down before those images and
[1:07:47] worship them Idols but that word didn't
[1:07:49] really pertain to him but there was a
[1:07:52] word that God gave him now for most of
[1:07:56] us we're not going to handle snakes uh
[1:07:58] some of you women are far beyond cutting
[1:08:00] your hair you're far beyond dressing
[1:08:02] like a young teenage girl that word does
[1:08:04] not pertain to you so Satan will not
[1:08:07] tempt you in that direction but he will
[1:08:10] tempt you and I in the direction of the
[1:08:13] word that is allocated to us and
[1:08:16] whatever our weakness is in that portion
[1:08:19] of the word you follow me so far CU
[1:08:21] every one of us no matter how saved we
[1:08:24] are how filled with the Holy Ghost we
[1:08:26] are there is a weakness that we have we
[1:08:29] have great strengths that we will never
[1:08:31] do this and that and the other and then
[1:08:34] there are weaknesses that we will have
[1:08:37] and that's exactly where Satan will hit
[1:08:39] us now notice this man of God he flatly
[1:08:43] refuses to bow to the king so now the
[1:08:46] king would have given him a great reward
[1:08:49] it would have been a great honor to go
[1:08:50] to the King's house and have lunch with
[1:08:52] him my the papers would have posted it
[1:08:55] great great man of God is entertained by
[1:08:57] the king said I'll not do it I'll tell
[1:09:00] you one thing the Lord told me not to do
[1:09:02] it no sir I'll not do it but what if a
[1:09:07] prophet comes to
[1:09:09] you and there dwelt an old prophet in
[1:09:13] bethl which means House of
[1:09:16] God and his sons came and told him all
[1:09:19] the works that the man of God had done
[1:09:21] that day in Bethel and The Words which
[1:09:23] he had spoken unto the king and the they
[1:09:25] told them also to their father and their
[1:09:27] father said unto them which way went he
[1:09:29] for his sons had seen the way the man of
[1:09:31] God went which came from Judah and he
[1:09:34] said unto his son saddle me the ass so
[1:09:36] they saddled him the ass and he rode
[1:09:38] thereon and he went after the man of God
[1:09:41] and found him sitting under an oak and
[1:09:44] said unto him art thou the man of God
[1:09:47] that camest for Judah and he said I
[1:09:49] am then he said unto him come home with
[1:09:52] me and eat bread and he said I may not
[1:09:56] return with thee nor go in with thee
[1:09:59] neither will I eat bread nor drink water
[1:10:01] with the in this
[1:10:03] place now watch him for it was said unto
[1:10:06] me by the word of the
[1:10:08] Lord Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink
[1:10:11] water there nor turn again go by the way
[1:10:14] which thou came as and he said unto him
[1:10:16] I am a prophet
[1:10:20] also as Thou
[1:10:23] Art and an angel
[1:10:28] spake unto me by the word of the
[1:10:34] Lord now what's this man's
[1:10:39] weakness through a
[1:10:43] contemporary a man by the D of his own
[1:10:48] caliber a man on the same plane as we
[1:10:51] would say that receives the word of the
[1:10:54] Lord
[1:10:56] and has
[1:10:58] visions and
[1:11:00] visitations By Angels now man I'll tell
[1:11:03] you one thing that'd be a hard guy to
[1:11:04] turn away from would it
[1:11:06] not I mean if a man come to you and said
[1:11:08] an angel of God come to me an angel of
[1:11:11] God said thus and so and thus and so and
[1:11:13] I am also a prophet like
[1:11:16] you oh wow I am a prophet also as Thou
[1:11:22] Art and an angel spake unto me by the
[1:11:25] word of the Lord saying bring him
[1:11:29] back with the into thine house that he
[1:11:32] may eat bread and drink
[1:11:36] water now I want you to listen what this
[1:11:39] Prophet
[1:11:40] did but he
[1:11:43] lied unto
[1:11:46] him oh my goodness so is this this man
[1:11:50] that was called a prophet was he a false
[1:11:53] prophet now be care
[1:11:58] careful was this man an
[1:12:02] impostor was this man an unbeliever an
[1:12:08] Infidel no he was actually a true
[1:12:13] Prophet why would God allow this why
[1:12:17] would God allow this man to come and try
[1:12:21] this man of God so you see it's not just
[1:12:24] that God wants to separate from drinking
[1:12:26] and adultery and fornication and all
[1:12:29] that God will allow us as his people to
[1:12:34] be Tried by the very
[1:12:37] message that we bring to others what was
[1:12:41] this man tried by the word about the
[1:12:44] flood was he tried about the word in the
[1:12:47] days of Noah or in the days of Moses
[1:12:50] he's tried by his own
[1:12:53] message amen
[1:12:56] right oh
[1:12:58] my praise the Lord but he
[1:13:02] lied unto
[1:13:05] him
[1:13:06] so he
[1:13:12] went so he
[1:13:15] back
[1:13:21] slid he went backwards
[1:13:26] and did eat bread in his
[1:13:29] house and drank water and it came to
[1:13:33] pass as they said at the table that the
[1:13:35] word of the
[1:13:38] Lord came unto the prophet that brought
[1:13:42] him
[1:13:44] back so the very man that lies to
[1:13:48] you to try to deceive you then God gives
[1:13:53] him a word
[1:13:55] about
[1:13:59] you now for those of you that understand
[1:14:01] this 100% my email is D D D D D you
[1:14:05] think I'm going to give that to
[1:14:06] everybody on this internet you can
[1:14:07] forget
[1:14:11] it
[1:14:13] man so here they set at the table then
[1:14:16] the word of the Lord come to the prophet
[1:14:18] that brought him
[1:14:19] back and he
[1:14:22] cried unto the man of God that came from
[1:14:25] Judah saying thus sayeth the Lord for as
[1:14:29] much as thou Hast disobeyed the mouth of
[1:14:32] the
[1:14:33] Lord and it's not the Commandment have
[1:14:36] not kept the Commandment which the Lord
[1:14:39] thy God commanded thee but camest
[1:14:43] back and has eaten bread and drunk water
[1:14:46] in the place of which the Lord did say
[1:14:49] to thee eat no bread drink no water thy
[1:14:52] carcass
[1:14:55] shall not come into the
[1:14:57] Seer of thy
[1:15:02] fathers you imagine that man pushes back
[1:15:04] from the table and thinking I ain't
[1:15:07] believing
[1:15:09] this I ain't believing
[1:15:11] this this man lied to me this man told
[1:15:16] me that an angel of God told him to
[1:15:19] bring me back and now he's telling me
[1:15:22] I'm going to die
[1:15:28] wow I wonder
[1:15:31] children as we go on in time and the
[1:15:34] deception of the end time moves closer
[1:15:36] and closer remember we're already under
[1:15:39] a pre-tribulation anointing that's upon
[1:15:41] the
[1:15:43] Earth the Jews have never been so
[1:15:47] persecuted the way they have been in the
[1:15:49] last several years all over Europe Asia
[1:15:54] Canada
[1:15:56] you're familiar with it all over
[1:15:58] everywhere it's increasing and if you
[1:16:00] will study down through time when the
[1:16:04] increase of
[1:16:06] anti-Semitism begins to strike the world
[1:16:09] it is
[1:16:10] forerunning a major change in the world
[1:16:15] you look at the Spanish Inquisition you
[1:16:18] look at the Spanish program you look at
[1:16:21] the French you look at the different
[1:16:23] ones down through time back in the
[1:16:25] medieval times and the ages thereafter
[1:16:28] and watch how the persecution against
[1:16:30] the Jews started it was ushering in a
[1:16:34] major
[1:16:36] change oh my the people of the world
[1:16:38] don't even realize why it is they feel
[1:16:41] this hatred against the Jews because the
[1:16:45] power of the Antichrist is fixing to
[1:16:46] rise that's
[1:16:49] why oh
[1:16:51] my and it came to pass after he had
[1:16:54] eaten I drunk that is saddle for him the
[1:16:58] ass he's going to be real nice to him
[1:17:00] now now that he's deceived him and lied
[1:17:02] to him and done prophesied his demise
[1:17:04] he's going to give him a taxi
[1:17:06] out to wait for the prophet whom he had
[1:17:10] brought back so we got two
[1:17:14] prophets both of them from
[1:17:18] God both of them have the direct contact
[1:17:23] in that fourth dimension to see visions
[1:17:26] and to speak on God's
[1:17:33] behalf oh
[1:17:35] my and when he was
[1:17:38] gone a lion met him by the way and slew
[1:17:44] him and his carcass was cast in the way
[1:17:48] and the ass stood by it and the lion
[1:17:53] also stood by the
[1:17:56] carcass and behold Men passed by and saw
[1:17:59] the carcass cast in the way and the lion
[1:18:03] standing by the carcass and they came
[1:18:05] and told it in the city where the old
[1:18:08] Prophet dwelt notice the Bible isn't
[1:18:10] calling him an old false prophet an old
[1:18:13] deceiver an old
[1:18:16] liar but an old
[1:18:20] Prophet you see it was some men like
[1:18:23] this
[1:18:25] in the era of
[1:18:27] Pentecost that warn their Pentecostal
[1:18:31] children against the prophet messenger
[1:18:34] of this
[1:18:35] age oh yeah there were some called the
[1:18:38] old prophets in Louisiana and
[1:18:40] Mississippi and Alabama and here and
[1:18:42] there and there and they warn their
[1:18:44] followers there will raise a man that
[1:18:47] will do this and that and the other
[1:18:49] don't you believe him don't you follow
[1:18:53] him and people said oh oh that old
[1:18:56] Prophet boy he told me this and that and
[1:18:58] the other come on
[1:19:02] somebody when the prophet that brought
[1:19:04] him
[1:19:05] back the
[1:19:07] prophet that brought him back from the
[1:19:10] way heard thereof and said it is the man
[1:19:14] of
[1:19:16] God who was
[1:19:19] disobedient unto the word of the Lord
[1:19:21] you know brother Philip reading this
[1:19:23] I've wondered somebody
[1:19:25] how did this man feel
[1:19:28] himself how did this man
[1:19:31] feel knowing that he lied I mean you
[1:19:35] think surely to goodness God would let
[1:19:38] two lines punish this man cuz he
[1:19:46] lied don't you understand friends what a
[1:19:48] judgment awaits for those in this end
[1:19:52] time who have heard the message of the
[1:19:54] hour and have turned away from it it
[1:19:56] will be worse for them than it will be
[1:20:00] for those who have never heard
[1:20:03] it oh Word of Life may we not turn away
[1:20:08] from the Word of Life of the end time
[1:20:12] I'm not just talking about this building
[1:20:15] here I'm talking about the message of
[1:20:17] the
[1:20:21] hour so here this Prophet hears about
[1:20:24] and he said it is the man of God who is
[1:20:26] disobedient unto the word of the Lord
[1:20:28] therefore the
[1:20:30] Lord has delivered
[1:20:33] him unto the
[1:20:37] lion which hath torn him and slang him
[1:20:41] according to the word of the
[1:20:43] Lord which that liar
[1:20:50] spoke so I ask you if God said send us a
[1:20:55] prophet with a message and then somebody
[1:20:56] else Rises up and says they are a
[1:20:59] prophet or they see Visions or they have
[1:21:02] dreams or they speak in tongues or you
[1:21:04] know whatever in that Supernatural realm
[1:21:06] and then they actually tell us something
[1:21:08] different than what God's Vindicated
[1:21:10] prophet of Malachi 4 said what are we
[1:21:13] going to
[1:21:15] do well I know what I'm going to do
[1:21:17] y'all going to have to answer for
[1:21:18] yourself is that right what are you all
[1:21:21] going to do that's the question
[1:21:25] oh
[1:21:26] my now notice what happens he's verse 27
[1:21:30] and he spake to his son saying Salomon
[1:21:32] the ass and they saddled him and he went
[1:21:34] and found his carcass cast in the way
[1:21:37] and the ass and the lion standing by the
[1:21:39] carcass now this is so unusual because a
[1:21:42] lion would eat a
[1:21:44] man but God would not allow this servant
[1:21:48] of
[1:21:49] God to be Dishonored in this way God
[1:21:53] punished him
[1:21:55] for his
[1:21:56] Disobedience now you see friends people
[1:21:58] say because we're bride and we're the
[1:22:01] chosen people of God we can get by with
[1:22:03] things oh
[1:22:06] no
[1:22:09] no and you imagine what preachers are
[1:22:12] going to have to answer for at the day
[1:22:13] of judgment if they're not true and
[1:22:16] genuine God gives every Minister an
[1:22:19] element of influence over his people and
[1:22:22] for every man that tries to pull them
[1:22:24] away way and pull them this way and that
[1:22:26] way every preacher will answer for
[1:22:31] that it's a fearful thing to be a
[1:22:37] preacher God help us he went and found
[1:22:41] his carcass in the way and the ass and
[1:22:43] the lion send by the carcass and the
[1:22:45] lion had not eaten the carcass nor Toren
[1:22:50] the ass which is really unusual even the
[1:22:53] arer of Kings here comments about that
[1:22:55] the lion didn't eat the body of the man
[1:22:57] of God nor did he turn on the ass but
[1:22:59] God had it done as a memorial and the
[1:23:04] prophet took up the carcass of the man
[1:23:06] of God and laid it upon the assh and
[1:23:07] brought it back and the old
[1:23:11] Prophet came into the city to
[1:23:15] mourn and to bury
[1:23:20] him and he laid his carcass in his own
[1:23:23] grave and they mourned over him saying
[1:23:26] alas my
[1:23:31] brother and it came to pass after he had
[1:23:33] buried him that he spake to his son
[1:23:35] saying when I am dead then bury me in
[1:23:38] the sufferer wherein the man of God is
[1:23:43] buried lay my bones
[1:23:46] beside
[1:23:48] his
[1:23:51] bones so you mean this man even though
[1:23:55] he disobeyed God he was still a man of
[1:24:00] God you see when you and I get out of
[1:24:02] the will of God it don't mean that we
[1:24:04] turn from seed of God to serpent
[1:24:06] seed it just means we're in
[1:24:11] trouble for the saying which he cried by
[1:24:14] the word of the Lord against the alar
[1:24:15] and Bethel against all the houses of the
[1:24:18] high places that are in the cities of
[1:24:20] Samaria shall surely come to pass
[1:24:25] now let's move from First
[1:24:27] Kings let's move
[1:24:30] now to
[1:24:32] shreport
[1:24:37] Louisiana before I left while preaching
[1:24:39] in sort one day the Holy Spirit fell
[1:24:43] upon me and said thus sayeth the Lord
[1:24:46] there is a snare set for you in South
[1:24:50] Africa now notice a year of this in 1952
[1:24:54] which is after the African trip in
[1:24:57] 1951 so the Lord shows brother brandham
[1:25:01] to make the trip to South Africa the
[1:25:03] Lord shows him an
[1:25:06] order of where to go to go from
[1:25:10] johannisburg to Durban go here go there
[1:25:13] God lays out the
[1:25:15] itinerary of the way he wants his
[1:25:17] Prophet to
[1:25:19] go B Paul's going to be with him brother
[1:25:22] Bosworth is going to be with him him
[1:25:24] julus stad cleff is going to be with him
[1:25:26] different preachers are going to be with
[1:25:30] him on this
[1:25:31] trip but the preachers they make up a
[1:25:35] separate
[1:25:36] itinerary than God's itinerary which is
[1:25:40] typical for
[1:25:42] preachers unless they're really LED of
[1:25:44] the spirit of God so they start opposing
[1:25:50] brother brandham in his
[1:25:52] itinerary so they tell him oh no no
[1:25:54] brother BOS said I never heard of such
[1:25:56] nonsense I mean some of the things the
[1:25:58] brother said was so
[1:26:01] disrespectful to God's prophets
[1:26:04] leading and yet whenever it come right
[1:26:07] down to it brother random still gave in
[1:26:12] to an element of the pressure that was
[1:26:15] upon
[1:26:17] them oh my I'll tell you one thing
[1:26:19] friends there's great pressure of being
[1:26:22] identified as a preacher and you know
[1:26:24] who tries to pressure
[1:26:29] preachers gamblers
[1:26:32] Bootleggers
[1:26:34] preachers
[1:26:37] preachers now watch so this is in sh
[1:26:40] Port before he goes to South Africa that
[1:26:43] he says this now whenever he gets there
[1:26:46] then oh my goodness it's absolute
[1:26:48] turmoil he's so tore up Billy's tore up
[1:26:51] and Billy said Daddy you know I I'll
[1:26:53] Stand with you and brother Bosworth was
[1:26:55] stand with you don't you worry about
[1:26:57] them preachers and brother randam called
[1:26:59] him honey and he said honey I know that
[1:27:01] but you know we ain't got no what no
[1:27:02] money to get back home we ain't got no
[1:27:04] way to get back home and he said well
[1:27:06] the Lord will the Lord will be with
[1:27:09] us now notice the same sermon in
[1:27:11] paragraph 33 about 3:00 in the morning
[1:27:14] he came into the room and I felt him he
[1:27:17] moved over to the side of the bed and
[1:27:19] said who are these men and what do they
[1:27:22] mean and he said go on
[1:27:25] go
[1:27:26] on they got you tied into it said go on
[1:27:30] but
[1:27:32] remember you'll pay for
[1:27:38] it now what I find amazing is that God
[1:27:42] through the angel of the Lord is telling
[1:27:43] his Prophet who wanted to obey him that
[1:27:46] he was going to be the one that was
[1:27:48] going to pay for the
[1:27:52] Disobedience now the other men got sick
[1:27:56] but they did not get
[1:27:58] AA which is a life
[1:28:01] taker you'll pay and he said you know
[1:28:05] you'll know and he said now that you
[1:28:08] might know you have my permission to
[1:28:12] go tomorrow morning you'll wake up your
[1:28:15] boy God honored Billy and said go wake
[1:28:17] up your boy and tell him tomorrow

[1:28:23] morning you're going to have a clear day

[1:28:29] bad and he said but it's going to be
[1:28:31] pretty the sun will be shining it'll be
[1:28:33] warm again Welly you're talking about a
[1:28:35] weather forecaster that don't miss
[1:28:38] brother Jesse if you had line into this

[1:28:49] ain't a cloud in the sky and we listen
[1:28:51] to them the very next day but here are
[1:28:53] the Ang of the Lord told him exactly

[1:29:05] you to come and pray for the sick being

[1:29:19] son is going to come back after you with
[1:29:21] a man in a little black
[1:29:24] car and on the road back on the road to
[1:29:27] get you he's going to pick up another
[1:29:29] young man that's contrary to the rules
[1:29:34] now brother REM didn't want people
[1:29:35] riding back with him to the meeting cuz
[1:29:37] he said they'd pull all the anointing
[1:29:39] out of you they talk 90 mil an hour and
[1:29:42] they' pull all the anointing out of you

[1:29:48] and is on the road back said he's going
[1:29:50] to call your attention and there'll be a

[1:30:06] prophecy Hallelujah near a eukalyptus
[1:30:10] tree by a
[1:30:13] bridge with a stick fixing to strike
[1:30:18] another
[1:30:20] native and said by that you'll know that
[1:30:24] I oh no oh
[1:30:26] no I give you permission to
[1:30:31] go but
[1:30:33] remember you will suffer for
[1:30:39] it I don't know about you children but
[1:30:41] as a Christian I want to eliminate every
[1:30:44] one of these snares in my life that I
[1:30:47] can what about it some of you that have
[1:30:49] made wrong choices in your life and some
[1:30:52] of you maybe are suffering to this day
[1:30:54] because choices you made would you not
[1:30:58] want to be spared for the rest of your
[1:31:00] life would you not want your children or
[1:31:02] your grandchildren to be spared from
[1:31:05] some of the things that you've been
[1:31:07] through what about it saints of
[1:31:11] God I walked into the room and I said
[1:31:14] Brethren I have dust saith the Lord I
[1:31:18] said we're doing wrong we're going down
[1:31:21] to Kimberly Clarks DOR Bloom Fontaine
[1:31:25] and Cape Town were doing wrong the will
[1:31:29] of the Lord is for us to go back here
[1:31:32] come down go back to Johannesburg and
[1:31:35] from there to brother Jackson you say
[1:31:37] what difference does it make the
[1:31:39] difference is God said it that way well
[1:31:43] why you say what difference does it make
[1:31:45] if we do church this way or that way or
[1:31:47] that way if God said it there is a
[1:31:51] reason and if you did not always tell
[1:31:54] your children why you wanted them to do
[1:31:57] this or that or the other or not to do
[1:32:00] this or that or the other you told them
[1:32:03] and you expected them to obey
[1:32:06] you well that's the same way the Lord is
[1:32:10] sometimes he says I want you to dress
[1:32:12] this way I want you to speak in tongues
[1:32:15] this way I want you to do this this way
[1:32:18] I want you to have church order that way
[1:32:21] come on somebody then are we going to
[1:32:24] argue with God or are we going to say I
[1:32:27] don't understand it and it may not make
[1:32:29] no sense to me but if God wants it done
[1:32:32] that way that's the way I want to do
[1:32:37] it oh
[1:32:42] my so here's the will of
[1:32:45] God the will of God the will of the Lord
[1:32:48] for us to go back here come down go to
[1:32:50] Johannesburg go from there over to
[1:32:53] brother jacks from there over to this
[1:32:55] Durban and I said but he gave me his
[1:32:58] permissive will this
[1:33:01] morning and gave me these signs and I
[1:33:04] told them what he told me and I said
[1:33:06] it's daylight outside now it's a pretty
[1:33:08] day and I said these things shall come
[1:33:10] to pass but
[1:33:13] remember it's not the will of the
[1:33:18] Lord oh children when it comes to the
[1:33:20] vocation in your life
[1:33:24] what you're supposed to do the work
[1:33:25] you're supposed to have the man or the
[1:33:29] woman you're supposed to
[1:33:31] marry the friends that you're supposed
[1:33:33] to
[1:33:35] have oh Lord
[1:33:37] Jesus how many have I talked to through
[1:33:39] the years and the Decades of the youth
[1:33:42] conventions and meetings that I preached
[1:33:44] around the
[1:33:45] world and how many of them that I've
[1:33:47] talked to and they say you know brother
[1:33:49] Donnie one of the worst mistakes I ever
[1:33:51] made in my life was I become a friend
[1:33:55] with this certain certain person little
[1:33:57] did I know they would pull me away from
[1:34:01] God you need to be selective of who your
[1:34:05] friends are come on don't get quiet on
[1:34:06] me you need to be selective of just pray
[1:34:11] I'd rather have one true god-given
[1:34:13] friend than 500 on Facebook that's 487
[1:34:18] of them is going to try to pull you away
[1:34:19] from God but to a lot of people what's
[1:34:22] more important is how many friends they
[1:34:24] got following them on Facebook and tell
[1:34:27] me what good does that do you so you can
[1:34:30] outdo somebody else what are you trying
[1:34:32] to be some kind of influencer you want
[1:34:35] to be somebody in this Modern Age that
[1:34:38] compares your numbers to somebody else
[1:34:41] wake up and realize that God places us
[1:34:44] on the earth not that our flesh will be
[1:34:48] gratified but that we might follow his
[1:34:51] will
[1:34:59] Hallelujah this is one thing that really
[1:35:02] gets me about a lot of these people that
[1:35:03] have left the message and they want to
[1:35:06] portray that brother Brenham was a
[1:35:07] deceiver and a liar and all that sort of
[1:35:10] thing and you think come on if a man was
[1:35:14] a deceiver and liar you think us he'd
[1:35:16] tell us these things about
[1:35:19] himself you think the smiley preacher
[1:35:21] from Texas is going to tell us about his
[1:35:24] missing the will of God how many message
[1:35:27] preachers is going to do it much less a
[1:35:29] prophet of God that knowing his tapes
[1:35:32] should be played to
[1:35:34] Millions this is the reason I can follow
[1:35:37] such a man CU he can stand and say you
[1:35:40] all need to do this and you need to do
[1:35:41] that but he can stand and say I'm messed
[1:35:44] up don't do what I done I'm messed up I
[1:35:47] miss the will of God don't do what I
[1:35:49] done
[1:35:56] Merry
[1:35:57] Christmas I ain't going to wait for you
[1:35:59] to unwrap you president I'm unwrapping
[1:36:01] it for
[1:36:06] you you remember one time there was a
[1:36:09] prophet in the
[1:36:10] land and another one went down and
[1:36:13] prophesied God told him what to do and
[1:36:15] he said don't eat or drink it's in First
[1:36:18] Kings 13 and this Prophet sent and told
[1:36:20] him the Lord said come back here and he
[1:36:23] minded the
[1:36:24] prophet in the stead of
[1:36:29] God you know what happened he lost his
[1:36:32] life both of them
[1:36:36] prophets no matter who they are you do
[1:36:39] what God tells you to
[1:36:44] do praise the
[1:36:46] Lord down along the road we all got sick
[1:36:51] now watch here it
[1:36:54] starts every one of us got sick and when
[1:36:57] I come home I almost died I had amoeba
[1:37:03] amoeba it's a parasite a little animal
[1:37:05] gets into the intestinal tract in the
[1:37:08] stomach like little
[1:37:10] Barnacles sticks there and sucks well it
[1:37:13] takes its course in about so many hours
[1:37:16] after it gets in the bloodstream if it
[1:37:18] comes on the liver and burst you live if
[1:37:21] it goes to the brain and burst the heart
[1:37:25] you
[1:37:27] die there's nothing they can do about it
[1:37:29] I walk the
[1:37:31] floor and
[1:37:33] prayed and
[1:37:35] cried and prayed and cried oh
[1:37:40] Lord my wife had to lead me to breakfast
[1:37:44] notice his cry till his eyes were shut
[1:37:47] nearly my wife had to lead me to
[1:37:49] breakfast no answer from God
[1:37:57] but you say in our mind we think but now
[1:38:00] wait a minute he told them preachers
[1:38:03] that they shouldn't be doing it I
[1:38:06] know but somehow the Lord still looked
[1:38:09] at it and realized that brother brandham
[1:38:11] as a
[1:38:12] man still allowed them to persuade
[1:38:16] him you see had he been totally innocent
[1:38:20] it would have been them that suffered
[1:38:23] and not
[1:38:24] him uh oh now y'all getting really
[1:38:26] scared ain't you you see it's the same
[1:38:28] way with
[1:38:29] us sometimes we may not actually bow
[1:38:33] everything that we know and we may not
[1:38:35] compromise everything we know but just
[1:38:37] to keep friends with this one that one
[1:38:40] or the other
[1:38:42] one we may not just really say anything
[1:38:45] but we don't oppose it cuz we don't want
[1:38:48] to hurt our dear friend
[1:38:53] you remember when God showed the Prophet
[1:38:56] The Vision about the be the
[1:38:59] bear brother bisco was there on the
[1:39:01] hunting trip brother R tells us about
[1:39:03] it and he said Lord you fulfilled your
[1:39:08] part Bud South wanted brother bam to go
[1:39:11] another
[1:39:14] way so brother bam said he didn't want
[1:39:16] to hurt his
[1:39:18] feelings but he said I never thought
[1:39:21] about hurting yours
[1:39:24] so the bear come through but brother
[1:39:27] renam wasn't at his spot now come on
[1:39:29] children don't sit there and look at me
[1:39:31] now we don't want to make this man an
[1:39:33] idol let's make him what he said himself
[1:39:36] a man sent from God that made
[1:39:39] mistakes and we can learn from his
[1:39:46] mistakes oh
[1:39:49] my so he had to repent got up before the
[1:39:52] Tabernacle
[1:39:54] and repented and asked the people to
[1:39:57] forgive him then comes back the next
[1:39:58] service and said Lord I I repented
[1:40:01] before them and again I ask you to
[1:40:03] forgive
[1:40:04] me why I didn't want to hurt brother
[1:40:07] Bud's
[1:40:08] feeling God wanted him to go this way or
[1:40:11] it's just a hunting trip it's just a
[1:40:12] hunting trip what difference does that
[1:40:16] make God Is So
[1:40:19] meticulous about his word
[1:40:23] and you see we've been around the
[1:40:25] message long enough now for many of
[1:40:28] us we're at the era to wear little
[1:40:33] things the years ago it's thought oh boy
[1:40:36] boy boy that's right man we we want to
[1:40:38] do everything I Prophet talk yes yes yes
[1:40:41] but many of us have been around for
[1:40:43] decades now decades many of you were
[1:40:45] born in message churches cut your teeth
[1:40:48] on message pews as we say well that
[1:40:51] don't matter anymore and that don't
[1:40:53] matter anymore and oh no now we're going
[1:40:55] along we're good we're good you know
[1:40:57] we're good we got our message churches

[1:41:00] the world and we're know all over the
[1:41:02] world yeah we're doing
[1:41:06] good I want to obey him right now just
[1:41:08] as much if not more so than I did when I
[1:41:11] came to the
[1:41:13] message in the
[1:41:16] 80s March the 27th
[1:41:21] 1983 I stood in my little p Coster
[1:41:23] church that I started and introduced the
[1:41:26] message of the

[1:43:10] exactly
[1:43:11] saying we're in the
[1:43:14] message if we're not careful we're
[1:43:18] headed toward another denominational

[1:43:36] them and we'll keep having them of
[1:43:38] course into the Rapture I'm not
[1:43:41] interested in this move and that move
[1:43:43] and that move I'm interested in this
[1:43:45] move right here move him from this Earth
[1:43:48] in a body
[1:43:50] change can I have a few more minutes
[1:43:55] notice now

[1:43:59] hand behind my head saying
[1:44:01] God what shall I do falling off weight
[1:44:04] Getting Thinner now remember brother
[1:44:05] Randon was a very small man anyway
[1:44:08] Getting Thinner and thinner worse and
[1:44:09] worse all the time getting worse weren
[1:44:12] nothing could be done worse all the time
[1:44:14] and my wife would say honey what's the
[1:44:16] matter I said oh
[1:44:19] sweetheart if you only knew how I felt
[1:44:23] I said I went against God's
[1:44:29] will and I said here I am broken nearly
[1:44:32] in my Ministry I told brother baar I
[1:44:35] said the Lord has spoke to me well his
[1:44:39] witness right now if I had him to come
[1:44:40] to the platform and I said if I take
[1:44:43] that

[1:44:58] was acting putting on Brother D it
[1:45:01] wasn't like he's been a hypocrite he
[1:45:03] just simply changed the
[1:45:06] itinerary the
[1:45:11] itinerary now you realize God will
[1:45:15] always put
[1:45:18] leaders under a tighter
[1:45:21] scrutiny than anyone else in the move of
[1:45:25] God you say why would God do that to
[1:45:27] that man of God cuz he was a great
[1:45:31] leader why would God do this to brother

[1:45:37] itinerary because he was a
[1:45:39] great
[1:45:41] leader and
[1:45:43] leaders are
[1:45:46] responsible not just pastors evangelists

[1:46:08] us listen to this now if I take this
[1:46:12] itinerary thus saith the
[1:46:15] Lord I'll not even be able to have a
[1:46:18] meeting between 6 months and a
[1:46:21] year and this was the seventh or the
[1:46:24] eighth
[1:46:26] month so brother brandham had not been
[1:46:28] able to have meetings for eight
[1:46:34] months so what about all the sick that
[1:46:37] could have been healed what about all
[1:46:39] those that could have been
[1:46:43] delivered that's what I said I can
[1:46:45] follow a man like
[1:46:49] this one morning laying yers it was
[1:46:52] about
[1:46:54] 3:00 now think about it where he's
[1:46:57] at he don't even know what his future
[1:47:01] holds I said what does my future hold
[1:47:05] and about that time I felt something
[1:47:07] moving to the room get your memories
[1:47:10] ready now I'm going to tell you
[1:47:13] something that's going to happen he came
[1:47:16] into the room and I knew it was him and
[1:47:18] I laid real still felt moving around and
[1:47:22] it come
[1:47:29] going like laps of fire move down into
[1:47:34] the room come where I was just saying I
[1:47:37] seen
[1:47:38] one come walking to me and he had paper
[1:47:42] something like typewriter
[1:47:45] paper it was folded like this in his
[1:47:48] hand which I have no idea exactly what
[1:47:50] he meant but somehow folded in his hand
[1:47:52] and he walked up to me and said as you
[1:47:54] were meditating upon your
[1:48:00] bed what would be your
[1:48:03] future and I said yes Lord I've
[1:48:06] wondered what my future
[1:48:10] held he took the paper like this and
[1:48:13] creased
[1:48:15] it and said look you there where some of
[1:48:18] them laid but a great stack of it and he
[1:48:22] swung
[1:48:24] it in like that and it went Plum out of
[1:48:29] sight up into the heaven and he
[1:48:32] said it is
[1:48:38] clear your
[1:48:42] future is
[1:48:46] clear I came to myself I was sitting on
[1:48:49] the side of the bed and said oh
[1:48:50] god oh please
[1:48:54] speak if I found favor with you Lord
[1:48:57] please what about these of me but what's
[1:48:59] going to happen
[1:49:01] Lord I love the way he talked to
[1:49:05] God I said
[1:49:08] please if it's
[1:49:10] in your great
[1:49:15] heart if it's in your great
[1:49:19] heart if my sins are forgiven me
[1:49:24] speak to me what about it
[1:49:27] Lord I said I'm laying here I'm just
[1:49:30] about to die I said I've trusted you I
[1:49:32] believe in you I've Tau him and I said
[1:49:36] won't you have
[1:49:37] mercy about that time I felt something
[1:49:42] coming come back into the room and move
[1:49:44] down over me and said as thou was
[1:49:47] thinking about that it shall be no more
[1:49:54] more
[1:49:57] that settled
[1:50:04] it so what could be one of the greatest
[1:50:08] things that you and
[1:50:11] I if you could give
[1:50:14] Jesus a
[1:50:16] gift now we're all the time receiving
[1:50:18] from him of all of his kindness and
[1:50:21] mercies and goodness and so
[1:50:23] on but if you and I today
[1:50:27] could this is the weirdest strangest
[1:50:30] time of the year when you look at it
[1:50:32] people say it's his birthday and yet we
[1:50:35] buy gifts for everybody
[1:50:37] else I'll tell you one thing if you had
[1:50:39] a birthday party for me and you give all
[1:50:40] my presents to everybody else I'd be
[1:50:42] thinking y'all are pum
[1:50:44] crazy but that's what we do to Jesus we
[1:50:47] say this is his birthday and we give
[1:50:48] birthday presents of people we don't
[1:50:50] even know and well do I come to a close
[1:50:53] today let me just ask
[1:50:57] you so if you could I could go into his
[1:51:00] presence
[1:51:01] today and give Jesus
[1:51:06] something what could we give him that
[1:51:09] would mean the most to him you know how
[1:51:12] it is with
[1:51:13] gifts you get them and you look at them
[1:51:15] and you think what were they
[1:51:20] thinking oh y'all going to say trying to
[1:51:22] act Pious this morning aren't
[1:51:25] you man you're thinking what in the
[1:51:28] world they must think I am really
[1:51:31] weird I mean they bought this and that
[1:51:33] and the other and you say oh my
[1:51:37] goodness so what can you and I I'm
[1:51:40] including myself with you
[1:51:42] today cuz you see I also have messed up
[1:51:47] oh yeah I'm not women no women I'm not
[1:51:49] drunk or nothing like that but I made
[1:51:52] mistakes along the
[1:51:54] way several years ago there was a
[1:51:57] certain request Financial request that
[1:51:59] was made known to me by a close preacher
[1:52:03] friend of
[1:52:04] mine to
[1:52:06] help build a church in a certain
[1:52:10] place and they wanted me to contribute
[1:52:13] so much
[1:52:14] money and I prayed and I prayed and I
[1:52:16] kept feeling so funny about
[1:52:20] it just really strange in my heart I
[1:52:23] thought well I'm going to give it a
[1:52:24] little bit of time and I'm going to I'm
[1:52:25] going to go back to the Lord again and I
[1:52:27] did I went back to the Lord again and
[1:52:29] every time I did I kept feeling this
[1:52:33] strange feeling it was not not his
[1:52:37] approval those this friend of mine
[1:52:40] contacted me brother Donnie if you made
[1:52:41] a decision we're going to we're going to
[1:52:43] send money and I said
[1:52:44] brother I prayed and prayed over this
[1:52:47] and I just cannot feel right about doing
[1:52:51] this I don't what it is what he said do
[1:52:53] you know anything against the man I said
[1:52:55] not one thing that I know of I've
[1:52:58] actually been there with some man and
[1:52:59] preached for him I don't know one thing
[1:53:01] against him I said but I just feel
[1:53:02] really
[1:53:03] funny he said brother Donnie I'll tell
[1:53:06] you what it is it's Pentecost to
[1:53:10] carryover you're letting that old thing
[1:53:12] influence
[1:53:14] you I said well maybe I
[1:53:18] am maybe I'm just letting Pentecost
[1:53:21] influence me
[1:53:23] so I agreed to
[1:53:25] help so we sent several
[1:53:28] thousand they built the
[1:53:31] building had a big dedication service
[1:53:33] which I wasn't able to go and be a part
[1:53:35] of it but a storm come up while they was
[1:53:38] having it part of the building
[1:53:42] collapsed some of the Saints there were
[1:53:45] killed some
[1:53:47] injured that was bad
[1:53:49] enough six months or so later
[1:53:53] this man come to his Pulpit with his
[1:53:55] Bible and
[1:53:56] quotes and introduces to his
[1:53:59] church
[1:54:01] polygamy which he had already been
[1:54:03] practicing for quite some time in
[1:54:10] secret when I heard this
[1:54:13] news I felt so
[1:54:17] ashamed I feel ashamed telling you today
[1:54:22] I have asked God over and over again to
[1:54:27] forgive
[1:54:28] me had I not known i' still felt bad but
[1:54:33] that little something that I had a
[1:54:35] contemporary of
[1:54:37] mine taught me out
[1:54:40] of you see friends what I'm talking
[1:54:44] about but I can guarantee you
[1:54:48] this it will
[1:54:51] never happen happen to me
[1:54:54] again if I feel my God is leading me in
[1:54:57] a direction if every one of you go
[1:55:00] against me if I have to I'll Stand by
[1:55:05] myself I've done been whooped
[1:55:08] enough over missing the will of
[1:55:15] God so let's wrap
[1:55:18] Jesus a gift this morning
[1:55:22] now I won't have you to stand up and
[1:55:24] tell your faults and flaws and as your
[1:55:27] pastor I know many of them I'll be the
[1:55:30] Fall Guy this morning and tell you at
[1:55:32] least one of
[1:55:34] mine but the way I look at it if Jesus
[1:55:37] is willing to accept me and take
[1:55:42] me shouldn't I be willing to rap for him
[1:55:47] the greatest thing I could give him
[1:55:49] today and believe it or not
[1:55:53] what he
[1:55:54] wants is
[1:55:59] me I've made mistakes
[1:56:02] Lord I've fallen short of your
[1:56:05] glory you've heard me tell it before
[1:56:07] when I came to the message years and
[1:56:09] years ago and it went for a long
[1:56:12] span that God hadn't spoke to me in a
[1:56:15] long time and I looked at my life I
[1:56:17] searched my life I couldn't find nothing
[1:56:20] that I'd done wrong and I went before
[1:56:21] him Lord Lord what's
[1:56:23] wrong why haven't you spoke to
[1:56:27] me and he said you won't let
[1:56:30] me because you've let the message
[1:56:33] preachers tell you I don't speak no
[1:56:38] more yeah as your
[1:56:41] pastor I've made many
[1:56:45] mistakes but I want to take all my
[1:56:48] flawed Humanity
[1:56:52] and all my
[1:56:55] shortcomings and what I'd like to do
[1:56:57] today is wrap it in
[1:57:00] something that will be
[1:57:04] presentable I'd like to petition my
[1:57:08] father for my wrapping

[2:00:05] believe I've got a few more sermons
[2:00:09] left I believe I've got some more

[2:01:07] Away I'm not like a piece of china that
[2:01:11] if one found from the Ming
[2:01:15] Dynasty that would be worth several
[2:01:17] hundreds of thousands of dollars or
[2:01:19] depending on the peace Millions
[2:01:23] I'm not like pottery that I saw years
[2:01:25] ago in the museum of egyptology and
[2:01:29] Cairo
[2:01:30] Egypt that dated back before you came to
[2:01:33] the
[2:01:35] Earth though it was mere clay yet
[2:01:40] Priceless because where it come from and
[2:01:42] the time frame it
[2:01:46] lived and I always Marvel as I stand in
[2:01:49] in museums and see those things that I
[2:01:51] think
[2:01:53] well if man would value a piece of clay
[2:01:57] molded into a
[2:02:00] pot then you could
[2:02:02] certainly value your
[2:02:05] children pieces of clay that are molded
[2:02:09] with ears and eyes and hands and
[2:02:12] feet Lord Jesus wrap me up today in your
[2:02:17] grace not only me Lord but these people
[2:02:22] wrap us in your grace unmar
[2:02:28] favor stick that red crimson
[2:02:32] bow cuz that's the only way I could beat
[2:02:36] you covered in
[2:02:40] blood put that name
[2:02:43] tag on the outside of my
[2:02:46] life and say to
[2:02:50] Jesus I believe right now while I'm in
[2:02:52] your
[2:02:54] presence I've got the

[2:03:34] we know who holds
[2:03:37] it Jesus we worship you help us to pray
[2:03:42] and seek your face like never before
[2:03:45] Lord about the will of God for our
[2:03:48] Lives who our friends are where we go

[2:03:58] Lord father these that are seeking
[2:04:01] vocation changes and uncertain what the
[2:04:04] life holds help them

[2:04:28] and let
[2:04:30] Jesus finish wrapping our
[2:04:35] package with his grace an unmerited
[2:04:39] favor can we just bring to
[2:04:43] him what the president of the United
[2:04:46] States would not want the governor of
[2:04:50] Tennessee the senator
[2:04:52] the
[2:04:53] Congress you think they would want you
[2:04:56] all they want is your vote and your tax
[2:04:58] money they don't want you they don't
[2:05:00] even like
