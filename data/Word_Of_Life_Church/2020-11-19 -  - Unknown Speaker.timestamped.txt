[27:19] second timothy chapter 3

[27:26] louis said brett gilbert had had a
[27:28] request that he wanted us to
[27:29] pray about tonight also like you to
[27:33] remember brother jack and sister betty

[27:36] came out a little bit ago and sister
[27:38] betty got to come home monday night
[27:41] and um they're both doing doing pretty
[27:43] good
[27:44] uh with the coveting they're still not
[27:45] over it yet but we thank the lord for
[27:48] for the improvement that they've had i'm
[27:50] still likely to remember my daughter
[27:52] alicia if you would she's feeling
[27:54] better the lord touched her here sunday
[27:56] whenever in service
[27:57] and we certainly appreciate that but
[27:59] still needs a touch from the lord
[28:01] and like you remember erica also erica's
[28:03] doing well
[28:04] thank the lord we so appreciate that had
[28:06] four treatments got a fifth one coming
[28:08] up
[28:08] a week after thanksgiving which is
[28:10] monday tuesday and wednesday and
[28:12] uh she still gets tired and things but
[28:14] we're so grateful so
[28:16] many of the symptoms that normally
[28:18] accompany the chemotherapy and all that
[28:20] the lord has been
[28:21] so gracious to her and we certainly
[28:24] appreciate it
[28:24] how many's got so much to thank him for
[28:27] you know what
[28:28] i told carol yesterday and today was
[28:30] talking about it you know we can spend
[28:31] all of our time
[28:33] just being so sad and so down we got a
[28:36] lot to
[28:36] affect us we should don't we that's
[28:38] right we do or
[28:40] we can spend that time being grateful
[28:41] that all the things that he does for us
[28:44] through the midst of all these
[28:46] difficulties it's your path
[28:48] you choose which way you want to go you
[28:50] can praise your way out of it or feel
[28:52] sorry for yourself and have the mully
[28:53] grubs and
[28:54] just be mad and aggravated everybody
[28:56] else that don't help you or nobody
[28:58] else either the only person that helps
[29:00] is the devil and i'm going to do
[29:01] everything i can to hurt that rascal
[29:04] not helping don't you amen god bless you
[29:08] let's
[29:08] let's read together and then we'll pray
[29:10] over the word tonight
[29:11] also i wanted you to to remember
[29:14] brother randy and gessenden he'll be
[29:17] getting
[29:18] some treatments in about two weeks they
[29:20] were able surgically to remove
[29:24] all the cancer that was in brother
[29:25] randy's body but part of it they could
[29:27] not remove so
[29:28] um they were going to have to begin
[29:31] chemo in two weeks and i asked him if it
[29:33] was okay if i mentioned it to you all
[29:34] and i said most certainly wanted you all
[29:36] to know about it
[29:37] and to be praying for him so we'll
[29:39] certainly be remembering our brother
[29:40] that the lord will just be with him and
[29:42] my sister sharon as well
[29:44] well let's read about the times that
[29:45] we're in ii timothy 3
[29:47] 1. this know also
[29:51] that in the last days
[29:54] perilous times shall come and anybody in
[29:58] here with me tonight say
[30:00] it's here it's here
[30:05] for men shall be lovers of their own
[30:07] selves covetous
[30:09] boasters proud blasphemers
[30:13] disobedient to parents unthankful
[30:16] unholy without natural
[30:19] affection wow these are your neighbors
[30:24] some of your family some of your friends
[30:27] some of the people you work with i hope
[30:30] it ain't known you all
[30:32] without natural affection truce breakers
[30:36] false accusers incontinent
[30:39] fierce despisers of those
[30:43] that are good traitors
[30:47] heady high-minded
[30:50] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[30:53] god
[30:55] and notice the last verse is the
[30:57] clincher of all this
[30:58] they're not infidels and agnostics and
[31:01] they're not communist
[31:02] in reality they're not even socialist
[31:06] but they're having a form of godliness
[31:09] but denying the power thereof from
[31:12] such turn away
[31:15] my mind think of it you're living in
[31:18] this very time
[31:19] frame and god by his grace has rescued
[31:23] you
[31:24] has rescued me has rescued all of those
[31:28] that believe
[31:29] from being these people because in
[31:32] reality a lot of us
[31:34] fulfill these verses you know there
[31:36] might be certain ones you didn't do but
[31:38] when you look at it
[31:39] i had a whole lot against me and so did
[31:42] you thank god for his grace
[31:44] can we pray together heavenly father we
[31:47] bow our heads to the dust of the earth
[31:49] and
[31:50] we know lord jesus that through the
[31:53] breath of life
[31:54] you have breathed into this dust body
[31:57] eternal life and we are so thankful
[32:01] but we know that the body itself never
[32:04] caught that breast
[32:05] but it was the soul and we know if time
[32:08] would tarry
[32:10] and you lord would delay your coming
[32:13] before too many years
[32:15] father some that's standing here lord
[32:18] another generation
[32:19] will be no doubt the preachers and the
[32:22] deacons and the trustees and the
[32:24] musicians
[32:26] and time will roll on so father
[32:29] we ask that while we are here and we
[32:32] have
[32:32] an opportunity help us to serve you
[32:35] with everything that we have our
[32:38] strengths
[32:39] our might our mental capacity
[32:42] everything that we are and mainly our
[32:45] soul that's in love with you
[32:47] father these needs and requests that
[32:49] we've mentioned to you tonight god
[32:51] no doubt there's many many others i pray
[32:53] that you'd be mindful of us lord
[32:56] we thank you for through all the things
[32:58] that we go through
[32:59] your grace is sufficient we love you
[33:02] with all of our hearts
[33:04] open our understanding tonight father to
[33:06] your word
[33:08] in the name of the lord jesus we ask it
[33:10] amen
[33:11] god bless you saints you may be seated
[33:18] thank you
[33:24] i find this an amazing verse
[33:28] that paul would start to address
[33:32] such traits and characteristics of the
[33:35] last days
[33:37] and he would use these opening words
[33:42] this no also
[33:46] we know that also as in the english
[33:49] language it is a word
[33:51] that is added to something else
[33:54] that has already been seen heard
[33:57] or said of course you read chapter 1 and
[34:01] chapter 2
[34:02] of second timothy of the things that
[34:05] paul has already
[34:07] addressed but he felt the need
[34:10] to also include this
[34:14] needless to say it's not something that
[34:17] would make us
[34:18] very happy the contents of these five
[34:22] verses are not something that is
[34:26] uplift uplifting to us
[34:30] doesn't make us feel like shouting
[34:34] doesn't make us feel like rejoicing
[34:38] but yet it's a part of prophecy
[34:42] and sometimes prophecy has
[34:45] this side now it uses these words
[34:48] this know also that in the last days
[34:53] perilous times shall come the terms
[34:56] last days are actually words that were
[34:59] brought over
[35:00] from the old testament it was used
[35:03] first of all in the book of genesis
[35:06] whenever the prophet
[35:07] said come you sons of jacob and i will
[35:11] tell you
[35:12] what will befall you in the last days
[35:16] also used in the book of isaiah
[35:19] also used in the book of daniel so
[35:22] we know that it is a term
[35:26] that is used to be able to frame
[35:30] something that would fit in a certain
[35:32] time
[35:33] frame now actually whenever paul is
[35:36] writing this
[35:37] the last days is already
[35:40] in motion because the term last days
[35:44] is inclusive from the first century
[35:48] until the time of the rapture
[35:51] or the going away of the bride so it's
[35:53] during this
[35:54] interim period that this term
[35:58] last days is going to be so it's not the
[36:00] last 25 days before the rapture it's not
[36:04] the last 10 days but it's inclusive now
[36:07] prophetic language can be kind of
[36:10] strange
[36:10] now we would think well why didn't he
[36:13] just say
[36:14] the last 2000 years but you see
[36:17] days is a term that god
[36:20] anointed his prophets to use when it
[36:23] would be
[36:24] something that would be a symbol that it
[36:27] would actually
[36:27] symbolize a period of time so instead of
[36:31] saying
[36:31] two thousand years it would say the last
[36:34] days the last two days
[36:36] two days which fell in succession so
[36:38] god's
[36:39] way of saying things sometimes is
[36:42] very difficult to us and we think well
[36:45] by reading the bible that we just read
[36:47] it
[36:47] the way we'd pick up a newspaper and
[36:49] read it that way
[36:50] but we'll miss so much if we do
[36:54] so paul knew that the last days had
[36:57] already
[36:57] begun john turned it and said that
[37:00] you've heard
[37:01] that the last times or the latter days
[37:04] or the last part of the sequence of time
[37:07] would come to pass
[37:08] and he said that the antichrist would be
[37:11] revealed
[37:12] and he said it's already here
[37:15] so the succession of the last days
[37:18] has been going on since the first
[37:20] century actually from the time
[37:22] that the lord jesus began to speak of
[37:25] the prophetic hunters from john the
[37:27] baptist
[37:27] actually when john the baptist come and
[37:29] spoke what he done john never spoke so
[37:32] much
[37:33] of what would come after the lord jesus
[37:35] but it was
[37:36] the beginning of the dispensation was
[37:39] with the son of man
[37:40] and when the son of man the lord jesus
[37:43] began to utter
[37:44] the prophetic things that actually
[37:46] started the sequence of what is known
[37:48] as the last days now in that there would
[37:51] be times
[37:52] that the last days would catapult to
[37:55] reach such
[37:56] heights of the prophecies and there
[37:59] would be times that it would
[38:01] go down and it would ease up a little
[38:03] bit we know
[38:04] that the bible tells us in the book of
[38:06] acts that the churches
[38:08] had rest so it was as if god would
[38:11] force satan to back off the pressure
[38:14] that was against the churches and they
[38:16] would have a little
[38:18] a little bit of reprieve away from that
[38:21] time we know that it would coincide
[38:23] with the roman emperors that caligula
[38:25] and different ones would come through
[38:27] and they would actually buy they would
[38:29] cause such difficulty
[38:31] on the church and then you would have
[38:32] ones and it would have
[38:34] seemingly a change of heart they would
[38:36] still be a roman emperor
[38:38] they were still as heathen as they could
[38:40] be but god
[38:41] would move on their hearts and give the
[38:43] churches a little bit of reprieve then
[38:46] of course we know it come at the time of
[38:47] constantine
[38:49] that when it come there 300 325 all of
[38:52] that the constantine
[38:53] actually was the beginning of the
[38:56] roman church as we know today but in
[38:59] that time the church had
[39:01] several decades of time by which they
[39:04] were given
[39:05] a great reprieve and there was not any
[39:08] tribulation
[39:09] and that seemed to be a great thing but
[39:12] yet god knew exactly
[39:14] that was the beginning of the end now
[39:17] what was
[39:17] the beginning of a reprieve of the time
[39:21] of tribulation because he put an end to
[39:24] the christians
[39:25] being crucified he put him in uh
[39:28] to where that they would no longer burn
[39:30] them as torches
[39:32] as they did in the days of the preceding
[39:35] emperors and it looked like a great
[39:37] thing but yet little
[39:39] did many of them know that by marrying
[39:42] the church
[39:42] into rome and setting christianity
[39:46] as the state religion then they would
[39:49] turn
[39:50] eventually from the roman empire into
[39:52] the roman
[39:53] catholic church then they would take
[39:56] that power
[39:57] and they would begin the inquisition
[40:00] they would begin the
[40:01] inquisitions of time of course the
[40:04] spanish
[40:04] inquisition and then the roman
[40:07] inquisition and the time that they would
[40:09] burn them and it would turn
[40:10] from the roman political power until the
[40:14] roman
[40:15] church power now for many
[40:18] many hundreds of years we've been living
[40:21] in a cycle
[40:22] by which the roman power has no longer
[40:26] been doing
[40:27] the inquisition but we know according to
[40:30] prophecy
[40:31] that the power will return again
[40:34] now we also know that america was seen
[40:38] in the prophet john's vision as he was
[40:42] on the isle of patmos and revelation
[40:44] chapter 13.
[40:46] and we know that in that in the book of
[40:48] revelation that
[40:49] the symbols of land and of water
[40:52] and of beasts and many of these things
[40:55] were used to symbolize
[40:56] powers and we know that whenever john
[40:59] saw
[41:00] a beast that would rise up out of water
[41:03] that it meant this beast power was
[41:05] coming forth
[41:06] out of thickness and multitudes of
[41:08] people
[41:09] but when john saw this peculiar looking
[41:13] animal and this animal raised up
[41:16] and it began to speak like a lamb
[41:19] now it was not like the ox or it was not
[41:23] like the bullock
[41:24] it was not like the beast of revelation
[41:27] 17
[41:28] but it was an animal or a power
[41:31] that raised up out of the land and there
[41:34] was not many
[41:35] people there now actually that power
[41:39] john saw a buffalo
[41:44] now the buffalo it had horns
[41:47] like a lamb which of course the
[41:49] buffalo's horns
[41:51] are really short it must have been very
[41:53] unusual to john
[41:55] and by naturally speaking it john had
[41:58] never
[41:58] more than likely ever seen a buffalo in
[42:01] his life
[42:02] but yet god was raising up this power
[42:05] that would be able to express and it did
[42:08] not come out
[42:09] of thickness and multitudes of people
[42:11] because the
[42:12] cherokee the arapaho the blackfoot the
[42:15] lakota
[42:16] all the different ones were scattered
[42:18] across this nation
[42:19] so john saw this power coming up out of
[42:23] a place where there was not many people
[42:25] there
[42:26] and it had two horns in the
[42:28] representation of
[42:30] civil and ecclesiastical power
[42:33] but when it first started out it started
[42:36] speaking
[42:37] as a lamb now this was the birth of our
[42:40] nation
[42:40] america and this is when the europeans
[42:43] come and they took it away
[42:45] from the original owners of it and that
[42:47] was the native americans
[42:49] and yet whenever it was founded the
[42:51] symbolism
[42:52] of its power was two horns not seven
[42:55] like john
[42:56] saw and there was not one that broke off
[42:58] the side and then had an eye
[43:00] which was antiochus epiphanes in the old
[43:03] testament but just two horns
[43:05] and notice there was no eyes in the horn
[43:08] so it was
[43:09] a symbol of a great power that would
[43:12] raise up now this is our nation
[43:14] and this is why i do not believe that
[43:17] our nation will ever
[43:18] turn toward communism i do not believe
[43:21] that
[43:22] as a whole our nation will ever turn
[43:25] solidly toward socialism if you'll
[43:28] remember the vision the prophet saw
[43:30] that he saw socialism and communism
[43:33] and all that merging together into
[43:37] communism and whenever he heard the
[43:39] voice say you know that it was to what
[43:42] watch russia watch communism not
[43:45] socialism now we've got socialists in
[43:47] our government we know that
[43:49] i mean know that there is a socialist
[43:51] power that's trying to raise up
[43:53] in america but don't you never fear that
[43:56] because
[43:56] it will be the power of catholicism
[44:00] that will raise under the civil and the
[44:03] ecclesiastical power
[44:05] that will actually lead this now you'll
[44:07] notice when the prophet saw
[44:09] this vision the prophet john he saw it
[44:12] maintaining
[44:13] in the stage of its use he never
[44:16] saw this nation actually turning into a
[44:20] ram but it was he said as
[44:24] a land so it was as a lamb so what did
[44:27] it signify
[44:28] it signified that this nation would
[44:31] raise
[44:31] in great power but it would never become
[44:35] an old nation like the european nations
[44:38] have done it would never become an old
[44:42] nation
[44:42] like babylon like syria like israel
[44:46] but it maintained its use and actually
[44:50] it would have been killed in its use
[44:53] now i'm sorry you didn't know i just
[44:55] quoted to you a direct quote from the
[44:57] message
[44:58] so notice this whenever john saw this
[45:02] then whenever brother branham turns and
[45:04] sees the same thing
[45:06] and he says that it was actually the
[45:09] nation itself never got hundreds and
[45:11] hundreds and thousands of years old
[45:13] as you know sicily and italy and many of
[45:15] those places
[45:16] but it still remains the identity of its
[45:19] youth so our nation itself grace
[45:21] a great part in the last days of
[45:24] prophecy
[45:25] and that those civil and ecclesiastical
[45:28] powers will come together
[45:29] and the prophet tells us over and over
[45:32] again
[45:33] that it will be through an election now
[45:36] he's not talking about the election of
[45:37] grace
[45:38] but he's talking about the american vote
[45:41] and that it would be
[45:42] through an election that they would put
[45:45] this power
[45:46] in and whenever it does this power makes
[45:49] a transition now it jumps from being
[45:53] as a lamb it starts out freedom of
[45:55] religion
[45:56] we the people we the people all the
[45:59] people
[46:00] has the rights to do this and do that
[46:02] and something else but
[46:03] at the right time it will change and the
[46:06] voice
[46:07] will go from the voice of the lamb and
[46:10] it will speak
[46:11] with the power of the dragon
[46:14] and it will speak as the dragon that was
[46:18] before it now friend you believe
[46:20] whatever you want to believe
[46:21] i believe that we are on the very fringe
[46:25] of that prophecy when the voice will
[46:28] change now will it come through
[46:31] and as a side and aspect of socialism
[46:34] you know you hear so much about the
[46:35] reset
[46:36] the reset they're wanting to reset our
[46:39] government
[46:40] and you know you look and you realize
[46:42] that through the covet thing already
[46:44] that people's rights have already been
[46:47] friends support
[46:48] and it looks like they're fixing to do
[46:50] it again and the governor of new york
[46:52] today
[46:52] you know yesterday had made a comment
[46:54] that a lot of the
[46:56] spread of it in their in their area was
[46:58] doing
[46:59] was to be laid on churches and on
[47:02] synagogues
[47:03] so now think of it if that same thing
[47:06] moves down
[47:07] into tennessee and ohio and all these
[47:10] other places well you churches keep me
[47:13] because you all are the ones that's
[47:14] doing it is it amazing
[47:16] all these people can get out and protest
[47:19] and do this and that
[47:20] and the other and none of them code the
[47:22] germs follow protesters
[47:24] okay well all right if that's the way
[47:26] you want to play ball i'll play with you
[47:28] then sunday morning we're having a devil
[47:30] protest
[47:32] we're having a sin protest so apparently
[47:35] if covet don't follow protests
[47:38] we're no longer just going to have
[47:40] church services alone
[47:41] but we're going to turn them into
[47:43] protest meetings
[47:45] and we'll protest abortion and we'll
[47:47] protest homosexuality
[47:50] and we'll protest drinking and lying and
[47:53] adultery
[47:54] and fornication
[47:57] well praise the lord if black lives
[48:00] matter can protest and none of them gets
[48:02] covered our true
[48:04] surely we can protest people killing
[48:06] babies
[48:07] well hallelujah isn't it amazing how
[48:10] that it turns
[48:11] when the shoe goes on the other foot
[48:13] people don't like that do they
[48:15] but you see our nation now will this
[48:18] happen before the bride is gone
[48:20] i do not know i do know there is a thus
[48:23] saith the lord from the prophet of god
[48:25] that he said it this way
[48:27] we will be facing a religious
[48:30] persecution
[48:31] it will come now will the bride see that
[48:34] i don't know
[48:35] will the bride enter into the initial
[48:38] stages of it
[48:39] i do not know all i know is i want to be
[48:42] ready
[48:42] every day of my life and if we do then
[48:46] god will give us strength to face it and
[48:48] there ain't no even worrying and
[48:50] threatening about it anyway because if
[48:51] we are
[48:52] your worry won't help you your faith
[48:54] will help you more than your worry will
[48:56] so we can see from the setting here in
[48:59] ii timothy
[49:00] that there are many many aspects of this
[49:03] prophetic word
[49:05] that must all come together at the right
[49:08] time now no matter how much the
[49:10] people of america and you know this is
[49:13] has probably been
[49:14] in the in the making for many many years
[49:16] of those who would like to destroy
[49:18] our democracy and they would like to
[49:20] take away the white the rights of the
[49:22] church and all of that
[49:23] but they could not do it until there was
[49:27] a release now we know that even the lord
[49:30] jesus
[49:30] even though he was light he could not
[49:33] come out of the grave and his body could
[49:36] not come back to life
[49:37] until his soul lined up with the
[49:40] prophetic word
[49:42] that within three days he would rise
[49:44] from the dead
[49:46] so that word kept him back from entering
[49:49] into his body there's no other reason
[49:51] why he did not just leave his body go
[49:54] down into hell
[49:55] empty out paradise and be gone the next
[49:57] morning well why didn't he do it there
[49:59] was a word
[50:00] that kept him from doing it right
[50:04] so the resurrection could not happen
[50:06] until
[50:07] the right time the rapture cannot happen
[50:10] till the right time the people who are
[50:14] finally going to lead our nation to
[50:16] total destruction
[50:17] cannot do it till the right time the
[50:20] right man cannot be the president or
[50:23] woman could not be the president
[50:26] i don't care how many they tried and
[50:28] what they tried to do
[50:30] it cannot happen until god's prophetic
[50:32] word
[50:33] lines up there's nothing you and i can
[50:35] do to make it happen
[50:37] and there's nothing we can do to stop it
[50:39] from happening
[50:40] now these are things that god
[50:42] sovereignly controls on his own
[50:44] it does not even depend on our
[50:47] faithfulness to it
[50:48] it does not depend upon how much we pray
[50:50] about it
[50:51] it regard many of these things god does
[50:53] and his own sovereign will and i am so
[50:56] glad
[50:57] because man would totally mess it up but
[51:00] notice paul mentions 19 different
[51:03] things conditions that would exist
[51:07] now i'm sure that no more than likely
[51:09] many of these things
[51:10] existed in the time when paul was
[51:13] writing this
[51:14] but it was a great decline that he's
[51:17] going to
[51:18] speak about it was times of a great
[51:21] rampage and great
[51:23] fierceness that was going on in society
[51:26] so it was not just in the church
[51:28] but it was as his term a societal
[51:31] uh degeneration and of falling apart
[51:35] of society of homeland of politics
[51:38] of religion so it's going to be a
[51:41] falling apart
[51:42] and these will be the observable 19
[51:45] characteristics that
[51:46] the believers will be able to look at
[51:49] now really
[51:50] only the believers will have the true
[51:52] insight many people can read this bible
[51:54] and say oh yeah
[51:54] yeah that's around that sure they're
[51:56] there but the believers been baptized
[51:58] by the holy ghost they have an insight
[52:01] that even
[52:01] just a bible reader would not see now
[52:04] the word that he uses as he introduces
[52:07] this
[52:08] is the word perilous and it means
[52:10] violent
[52:11] and fierce wild difficult
[52:14] grievous hard to bear and distressing
[52:19] so these will be perilous time anybody
[52:21] find them so in that day
[52:24] that day as it is in this day as it has
[52:27] been before
[52:27] but remember as we get closer to the
[52:30] consummation of time
[52:31] then these things will definitely get
[52:33] worse because it's like there's more
[52:36] demons
[52:37] that are released out of hell i
[52:39] personally don't understand how that
[52:40] works
[52:41] but i do know that with the opening of
[52:43] the seals there came a great change in
[52:46] the world of demons when the lord jesus
[52:48] came to the earth
[52:49] there was more physical manifestation
[52:52] and you hear
[52:53] the demon's voices crying out of people
[52:56] more
[52:56] in those three and a half years of his
[52:58] ministry than you did in the
[53:00] entire canon of scripture in the old
[53:02] testament which covered a span of
[53:04] hundreds and hundreds of years
[53:06] and got in that little short span of his
[53:08] life but here was all heaven on the
[53:10] earth
[53:11] and when all heaven when god was shown
[53:13] on the earth speaking
[53:14] it was as if though that on the
[53:16] reciprocating side of darkness that god
[53:19] allowed the darkness to speak out in
[53:22] demonology
[53:23] in a way that it had never done before
[53:25] so
[53:26] if the opening of the seals and the
[53:28] revealing of the son of man
[53:29] has brought to us the great presence of
[53:32] the pillar of fire
[53:33] then we pretty well ought to know that
[53:35] in this junction
[53:36] there will be darkness like never before
[53:39] and there will be such an onslaught
[53:42] against the body
[53:43] look friends i'm in contact with people
[53:45] all over the world and i hear from
[53:47] different parts
[53:48] of the world just about every day and
[53:51] you know being friends with many many
[53:54] people and it's
[53:55] absolutely amazing in the last six
[53:57] months
[53:58] what has happened not just in happy
[54:00] valley
[54:01] not just in the united states but all
[54:04] over the world the things that have
[54:06] happened
[54:07] and it seems like that the people of god
[54:09] are under
[54:10] such an attack like we have never seen
[54:12] it before
[54:14] but yet at the same time i would rather
[54:17] live right now
[54:18] than any time that has ever been in
[54:20] history
[54:22] to me my life is greater now than it has
[54:25] ever been before
[54:27] now i'm not talking about materially and
[54:29] finally i'm not talking about that
[54:31] i'm talking about my own walk with god
[54:34] and where the word is right now with so
[54:36] much going on
[54:37] i'll tell you i was sitting downstairs
[54:39] studying the other night and the lord
[54:40] just opened up some things to me i had
[54:42] to lay my laptop down
[54:44] and get up and just move about a little
[54:46] bit i thought i'm going to bust
[54:47] wide open right here on this couch and
[54:49] carol's going to come down here and find
[54:51] bits and pieces scattered everywhere
[54:53] i'm going to have to take a break and
[54:55] you think right in the middle of hell
[54:58] right in the middle of such burdens i
[55:00] mean that's what i'm talking about
[55:02] you've got burdens you've got stress
[55:04] you've got things you're dealing with
[55:06] that you've never dealt with in your
[55:07] life and look at the word look at what
[55:10] god
[55:10] is saying to us out of his word does not
[55:14] god concern himself with covenant us
[55:16] is god not concerned with the things his
[55:19] people are going through yes
[55:20] but to me what's god doing he's getting
[55:22] above the nest
[55:24] and he's flopping his wings and saying
[55:26] look how great i am
[55:27] look how big i am look how marvelous my
[55:30] word
[55:31] is don't just get your eyes on the
[55:33] trouble and on the sickness
[55:34] and on the heartaches and on the disease
[55:37] but get your eyes on me
[55:42] oh my god notice paul said that it would
[55:45] be
[55:46] perilous times i found in studying this
[55:49] that he used the same word that the lord
[55:53] jesus used in matthew 8
[55:55] 28 to describe the condition
[55:58] of the demonic man in the gatherings
[56:02] notice this
[56:02] matthew 8 28 and when he was come to the
[56:05] other side
[56:06] into the country of the genesis there
[56:08] met him too
[56:09] possessed with devils coming out of the
[56:12] tomb
[56:13] exceeding fierce now look at this word
[56:16] even though it's you know you wouldn't
[56:18] think it the word
[56:20] fierce is perilous hard to do hard to
[56:22] take to approach
[56:23] hard to bear troublesome dangerous harsh
[56:27] fierce savage now here is this man
[56:30] and the description that the officer
[56:33] matthew chose to write
[56:35] of a demon-possessed man was that this
[56:38] man was
[56:39] fierce but it wasn't just that he was
[56:42] had a display of anger but he was hard
[56:45] to deal with
[56:46] nobody knew how to handle him nobody
[56:49] knew
[56:49] what to do with him and yet the bible
[56:52] goes on to tell us
[56:53] so that no man might pass by that way
[56:57] so here we have a prophecy setting forth
[57:00] to us
[57:01] that people will be so under the power
[57:04] of demons
[57:05] in the last day they will believe
[57:08] doctrines
[57:08] of devils they will be under the
[57:11] influence
[57:12] of devils in their homes the influence
[57:15] of devils by the music
[57:16] they listen to if you don't believe that
[57:18] all you got to do is go in lowe's and
[57:20] walmart
[57:21] anywhere you go and all restaurants
[57:23] anymore they play rock and roll you
[57:24] can't even hardly sit there and eat
[57:27] right and then you think how in the
[57:29] world can people
[57:30] live with such stuff and yet we know
[57:32] it's preparing them for
[57:34] the tribulation period so they will be
[57:36] what
[57:37] what will the world become now this is
[57:39] not just america of course
[57:40] but the world will become a demonic
[57:43] graveyard
[57:44] to where people are so under the
[57:47] influence
[57:47] of these demon spirits that they will be
[57:50] fierce
[57:51] and it will be for the righteous that we
[57:54] will not want to be around
[57:56] where they are as it was the man the
[57:59] maniac of gadara
[58:01] that whenever he was there that the
[58:03] people would go around him they would
[58:05] walk way around to bypass
[58:07] where the man was because you never knew
[58:10] what he would say
[58:11] you never knew what he would do he would
[58:13] come up and chomp on people and scare
[58:16] people
[58:17] and chase people and you know as well as
[58:19] i do
[58:20] that if you and i saw anybody like that
[58:22] physically
[58:23] most of us are going to run from them
[58:25] are they not and yet many of the ones
[58:27] that we deal with today
[58:29] they're not chained with natural chains
[58:31] but friends they're chained in their
[58:33] souls
[58:34] they are souls that are in prison now
[58:38] they're so shrouded in darkness that's
[58:40] all they think about
[58:42] they think about filth they sing about
[58:44] filth
[58:45] their songs are filled with adultery and
[58:48] fornication
[58:49] they're filled with all kind well i wish
[58:51] somebody would preach with me tonight
[58:53] their songs are filled with all kinds of
[58:55] stuff and their movies
[58:56] that they watch are filled with one
[58:58] thing after another
[59:00] the books are filled with that the
[59:01] websites that they visit
[59:03] are filled with it well praise god
[59:05] that's the truth
[59:07] and yet it's so sad and you and i what
[59:09] do we want to do
[59:10] we're finally oh you think you're
[59:12] homesick now wait for a little more
[59:15] just wait for a little while longer when
[59:17] the demonic expression reaches so high
[59:20] that even you'll feel your very life is
[59:23] threatened by these demons remember it's
[59:25] not many of these people
[59:26] but it's the spirit in them that
[59:28] recognizes the spirit of god
[59:31] in you and it hates you notice then paul
[59:33] said
[59:34] in verse 2 whenever he lays it out that
[59:36] it will be the last days
[59:38] and then it will be in this this type of
[59:41] fierce
[59:41] perilous time he said for men shall be
[59:44] lovers of their own selves
[59:48] now why in the world would he start out
[59:50] these
[59:51] passages of scripture when he would use
[59:54] to describe the conditions
[59:56] and the very first one that he would use
[59:59] was this about self-love now we know
[1:00:03] that all of us
[1:00:04] are given this something by instinct by
[1:00:06] natural birth
[1:00:07] whatever you want to call it and it is a
[1:00:09] protective thing within us
[1:00:11] and automatically if we're driving down
[1:00:13] the road and we see
[1:00:14] a brake lights within three quarters of
[1:00:16] a second your brain will respond and
[1:00:18] your foot will go on the brake pedal
[1:00:20] uh god made us that way and it's built
[1:00:23] in us to fight or flight
[1:00:25] and we will assess the situation and see
[1:00:27] what do i do
[1:00:28] do i have to fight in this situation or
[1:00:30] do i run there's something
[1:00:32] in us it's that natural something for us
[1:00:35] to survive
[1:00:36] is that true it's in all of us that that
[1:00:38] is not what we're referring to
[1:00:40] we feed ourselves we take care of
[1:00:42] ourselves you know we take a shower we
[1:00:45] comb our hair
[1:00:46] we do all these things and that's just
[1:00:47] being nice to the folks you're going to
[1:00:49] set aside in church
[1:00:51] that's right but yet there's something
[1:00:53] about all of us we have that protective
[1:00:56] mode that is in us is that right well
[1:00:58] don't look at me some of y'all said but
[1:00:59] some folks you wish they did take a
[1:01:01] shower
[1:01:02] but that is not what we're talking about
[1:01:04] but it's whenever we
[1:01:06] would love ourselves above god
[1:01:10] it's whenever we become so narcissistic
[1:01:14] that we put our love our desire for what
[1:01:18] we want
[1:01:19] the way we look at things it can be our
[1:01:21] thoughts
[1:01:22] it can be our opinions it can be our
[1:01:24] goals in life
[1:01:26] and we want them and we're going to
[1:01:28] achieve them it makes no difference who
[1:01:30] it hurts
[1:01:31] and we really don't care whether god
[1:01:32] likes it or not then
[1:01:34] this is the type of love that paul is
[1:01:37] framing so he said for men
[1:01:39] shall be lovers of their own selves now
[1:01:42] remember this is not
[1:01:43] providing for yourself and helping
[1:01:45] yourself so
[1:01:46] paul begins this list of 19 evils
[1:01:50] that will be prominent in the last days
[1:01:53] of what we will deal with and truly
[1:01:54] describes
[1:01:56] our times to a t in reality notice this
[1:01:59] first lovers of their own self so this
[1:02:02] self-esteem emphasis of our day
[1:02:06] certainly fits as well notice this in
[1:02:08] the fire tower
[1:02:09] church age in the church age book i want
[1:02:11] to give you a warning right here
[1:02:12] it says concerning the last days that
[1:02:15] because of abounding
[1:02:17] iniquity the love of many will wax coal
[1:02:20] and the laodicean or last age self-love
[1:02:25] and love for material things will take
[1:02:28] the place
[1:02:29] of the true love of god so
[1:02:32] then when we look at this setting we're
[1:02:34] not talking about
[1:02:35] just people that's never even come to
[1:02:37] church don't know nothing about god
[1:02:39] you know somebody hand them a track on
[1:02:41] the street one day but we're talking
[1:02:43] about people that
[1:02:44] say they have known the lord they have
[1:02:47] walked with god
[1:02:48] but they become so involved in
[1:02:51] themselves
[1:02:52] so it's all about what they can get you
[1:02:55] know people come to church
[1:02:56] and they come to church that way they
[1:02:58] think everything in church ought to be
[1:03:00] regulated around them
[1:03:02] they think the temperature ought to be
[1:03:03] set the way theirs is in their home
[1:03:05] they think the music ought to be said
[1:03:07] according to the volume
[1:03:09] of the way they listen to it in their
[1:03:10] home well brother donnie go ahead and
[1:03:12] preach
[1:03:13] and they think this and this and this
[1:03:15] and this ought to be regulated about
[1:03:17] them now friends i hope you understand
[1:03:19] this is a very dangerous thing you
[1:03:22] are flirting with the laodicean
[1:03:25] self-love
[1:03:26] when you project your own taste your own
[1:03:30] position your own opinion and you will
[1:03:32] exalt that
[1:03:33] above the rest of the body you see as a
[1:03:36] body
[1:03:37] we come together and some people in
[1:03:39] their home they may keep it on 70.
[1:03:41] other people like it 72. i've been in
[1:03:44] some homes they're like at 76.
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:48] i sweated the whole time but i endured
[1:03:50] it thank god i didn't have to stay long
[1:03:52] but praise the lord i was able to make
[1:03:55] it now
[1:03:56] you understand what i'm saying but you
[1:03:57] see and all that most people that have
[1:04:00] tolerance and understanding
[1:04:01] we know that when we come together as a
[1:04:03] group as a body
[1:04:04] it's going to be that it's going to be
[1:04:06] in the in the mix of it all
[1:04:08] but some are so self-centered that it's
[1:04:11] all about what i don't and i
[1:04:13] and i and you can hear them all the time
[1:04:14] they complain about this
[1:04:16] and they complain about that and what is
[1:04:18] their complaint
[1:04:19] centered around them their personal view
[1:04:22] well i don't understand how come we have
[1:04:24] to do that
[1:04:24] i don't understand why they haven't
[1:04:26] asked my opinion really you don't
[1:04:27] understand why i haven't asked your
[1:04:29] opinion
[1:04:30] [Music]
[1:04:31] i have a hard time dealing with
[1:04:33] self-opinionated opinionators
[1:04:36] who only wants their opinion carried out
[1:04:39] well glory to god so you see this
[1:04:42] is part now you imagine first of all out
[1:04:44] of 19
[1:04:46] that this is one of the things that paul
[1:04:48] felt needed to be stressed
[1:04:50] first and immediately and to help people
[1:04:53] to see that it will be part of the
[1:04:54] spirit in the last day
[1:04:56] that our self-love for ourselves so
[1:04:58] that's our views
[1:05:00] our opinion i think i believe i believe
[1:05:03] this and that and the other
[1:05:04] notice in the prophet says in the
[1:05:05] laodicean or life's
[1:05:07] self love or love for material things
[1:05:09] will take place
[1:05:11] of the true love of god so it's not like
[1:05:13] that you can have this kind of love
[1:05:15] for yourself with the love of god
[1:05:18] totally impossible
[1:05:20] you cannot have this degree of love
[1:05:23] for yourself and have the love of god
[1:05:27] in your heart the way you need it for a
[1:05:29] rapture
[1:05:31] you see whenever we move into this type
[1:05:34] of love
[1:05:35] we actually have to forfeit the depths
[1:05:38] of the love of god that he wants us to
[1:05:40] have we cannot have both
[1:05:42] it's totally impossible because this
[1:05:44] degree of
[1:05:45] self-love is satanic
[1:05:50] praise the lord notice then
[1:05:54] the love for material things will take
[1:05:56] the place of the true love of god
[1:05:58] we need to guard against the power of
[1:06:01] sin
[1:06:02] in these last days so many are getting
[1:06:04] so hard now listen why
[1:06:06] because they haven't realized the
[1:06:09] effect of this last day spirit
[1:06:13] now you see this is what happens to
[1:06:16] church people
[1:06:16] as they said in church and they hear oh
[1:06:19] yeah oh yeah yeah i've heard that i've
[1:06:20] heard that i've heard that
[1:06:22] and they just take it you know well
[1:06:24] whatever and they really don't pay no
[1:06:25] attention
[1:06:26] and that well that'll never affect me
[1:06:27] that'll never affect me it's already
[1:06:29] affecting you if you think it won't
[1:06:30] affect you
[1:06:31] it's already moved to stage one in your
[1:06:33] life and
[1:06:34] it will come to where that it will
[1:06:36] become that it would take away
[1:06:38] your sensitivity to the spirit of god
[1:06:41] which will make your heart it'll make
[1:06:43] your heart against the word
[1:06:44] make your heart against singing of the
[1:06:46] songs of zion
[1:06:48] worshiping god and he begins to replace
[1:06:50] that with something else you see
[1:06:52] a lot of folks feel like that god made
[1:06:54] them the world's greatest critic
[1:06:57] and they really think them being such a
[1:06:59] great criticizer
[1:07:00] is a great thing well i'll tell you what
[1:07:02] the prophet of god said he asked the
[1:07:04] church
[1:07:04] and the random tabernacle to pray for
[1:07:07] him that god would get that spirit off
[1:07:09] of him
[1:07:10] for doing so much criticizing so if
[1:07:12] brother branham needed to repent
[1:07:14] and needed to get that criticizing
[1:07:16] spirit off of him
[1:07:17] i guarantee you most of us need to get
[1:07:19] it off of us
[1:07:21] don't consider that an attribute of god
[1:07:24] because it's not
[1:07:25] now what's this so many are getting so
[1:07:27] hard because
[1:07:28] they haven't realized the effect of this
[1:07:31] life's day
[1:07:32] spirit it is time to draw night to god
[1:07:35] and let him fill our lives with his love
[1:07:37] or we will
[1:07:38] feel listen now this is a warning we
[1:07:41] will
[1:07:42] feel the coldness of the last day
[1:07:45] church now he didn't say we were the
[1:07:48] last day church
[1:07:49] but we would actually start feeling the
[1:07:52] coldness
[1:07:53] of the last day church i don't know
[1:07:55] about you i don't want to feel that
[1:07:57] now i am not the last day church i'm
[1:08:00] part of the last day bride
[1:08:02] but as i as a laodicean living in this
[1:08:05] time
[1:08:06] frame as far as where we are i have to
[1:08:08] fight this thing off of me
[1:08:10] you've got to fight it off of you you've
[1:08:12] got to fight it off of you
[1:08:13] why because it is around us
[1:08:16] and there's nobody else that can do it
[1:08:19] for you
[1:08:20] and the church said or we will fill the
[1:08:23] coldness
[1:08:24] of the last day church and reject the
[1:08:26] truth
[1:08:27] of god which alone is able
[1:08:30] to help us so they will be lovers
[1:08:34] of themselves paul said they will be
[1:08:36] self-centered
[1:08:38] they will be narcissistic now they will
[1:08:40] be so
[1:08:41] narcissistic and you know the word nor
[1:08:42] narcissism and all that
[1:08:44] so they will be so self-centered about
[1:08:46] themselves
[1:08:47] and this is the degree of selfishness
[1:08:50] that is condemned
[1:08:52] in regard to their own interest they
[1:08:54] don't care who it hurts
[1:08:56] they don't care who it offends they do
[1:08:58] not care if you know if the wife has to
[1:09:00] do without the husband has to do with
[1:09:02] that
[1:09:02] they're going to do whatever they want
[1:09:04] to do oh my
[1:09:06] so with their rights and i'm the head of
[1:09:08] the home and i'm you know this and that
[1:09:10] and the other
[1:09:11] so if i want to buy this and then we
[1:09:13] have to do without bread and we have to
[1:09:15] do without whatever more
[1:09:16] i'm going to do it because i'm the head
[1:09:18] of the home well i'll say this you ain't
[1:09:19] got no right to be the head
[1:09:21] with that kind of attitude what is that
[1:09:24] narcissism so it's all about you
[1:09:26] focusing on what you want how you want
[1:09:29] it
[1:09:29] and when you want it preach brother
[1:09:34] now you see it is their object of life
[1:09:37] which tramples down on the very epitome
[1:09:40] of the life of the lord jesus now when
[1:09:43] he come he went to the exact
[1:09:44] opposite because narcissism does not
[1:09:46] come from god
[1:09:48] but it comes from satan it is the base
[1:09:51] of this hateful selfish self-centered
[1:09:54] type of a life that we have to be
[1:09:56] careful so if someone
[1:09:58] loves now listen to me they actually
[1:10:00] move two degrees
[1:10:02] into this and they will start in this
[1:10:04] direction
[1:10:05] and they will move in the avenue of
[1:10:07] narcissism and then they will start
[1:10:09] loving themselves more
[1:10:11] and more and more and they become more
[1:10:14] defensive
[1:10:14] of themselves and they're thinking more
[1:10:17] about themselves now if you don't
[1:10:18] misunderstand me
[1:10:20] but then there's actually a degree that
[1:10:22] it moves beyond just loving themselves
[1:10:25] till they start worshiping themselves
[1:10:28] so they will spend excessive time in
[1:10:31] front of the mirror
[1:10:32] because they are so beautiful or they
[1:10:35] are so handsome
[1:10:36] certainly ain't no man here that think
[1:10:37] they're beautiful you big sis if you do
[1:10:41] oh my they just think they're god's
[1:10:43] greatest gift to women you know
[1:10:45] and they just so admire their self or
[1:10:48] they admire
[1:10:49] everything that they have done and they
[1:10:51] look at what they've accumulated in life
[1:10:53] and i have done this and i have done
[1:10:55] that
[1:10:56] and i am a self-made man that should
[1:10:58] never come out of your mouth if you're a
[1:11:00] child of god
[1:11:01] oh if you've got money and you're rich
[1:11:03] you ought to thank god if he could trust
[1:11:05] you with it
[1:11:06] you could have been a pauper you could
[1:11:07] have been homeless tonight living under
[1:11:09] one of the bridges here in johnson city
[1:11:11] if
[1:11:12] it was not for the grace of god but you
[1:11:14] see when we go to taking the blessing of
[1:11:16] god
[1:11:17] and pointing it toward us as if though
[1:11:19] we've done all this i've done this
[1:11:21] i've done that the lord jesus spoke
[1:11:23] about this very thing
[1:11:25] when he was here so then the person can
[1:11:28] move to a spot to where they no longer
[1:11:30] love themselves so deeply but they
[1:11:33] actually start
[1:11:34] worshiping themselves now they will
[1:11:36] never bow down
[1:11:37] and the reason that this confuses people
[1:11:40] when you talk about worship is because
[1:11:42] people don't understand worship
[1:11:44] people saying that one oh you can go
[1:11:46] around every day of your life there's so
[1:11:48] many opportunities you miss in
[1:11:50] worshiping god
[1:11:51] you can worship god at walmart you can
[1:11:53] worship god at lowe's you can worship
[1:11:55] god
[1:11:56] on your job that don't mean you're going
[1:11:58] down through lows riding the back of a
[1:12:00] buggy
[1:12:00] and you're shouting and screaming and
[1:12:01] speaking in tongues they'll throw you in
[1:12:03] jail
[1:12:04] but you can walk down through there and
[1:12:06] you can be praising god and loving god
[1:12:09] and thanking god come on friends we
[1:12:10] don't have to make ourselves peculiar
[1:12:12] and odd
[1:12:13] you can do it making an apple pie you
[1:12:15] can do it making up your bed is that
[1:12:17] right
[1:12:17] so what do you do you're giving him the
[1:12:20] homage of your heart
[1:12:21] you're giving him the deepest being that
[1:12:24] you
[1:12:24] are and you give that to him because
[1:12:27] it's reserved for him only
[1:12:28] but when a person goes to worshiping
[1:12:30] themselves
[1:12:31] then they go to recalculating everything
[1:12:34] of their life if they're a married woman
[1:12:36] a married man
[1:12:37] then they will pull everything every
[1:12:40] family activity
[1:12:41] everything around themselves so their
[1:12:43] day off is what is centered around them
[1:12:46] their time off well this is my time this
[1:12:49] is my
[1:12:50] day off this is my my mouth watch this
[1:12:53] now this is key words i
[1:12:54] me and mine and it's key words to see if
[1:12:57] you're worshiping yourself for
[1:12:58] worshiping god
[1:13:00] well hallelujah you see when it's all
[1:13:03] about you and your
[1:13:04] thoughts and your opinion and this and
[1:13:05] that another you're probably a
[1:13:07] self-worshiper
[1:13:08] now i want to tell you yourself never
[1:13:10] made yourself and it can't save yourself
[1:13:12] and it can't deliver yourself
[1:13:13] so you're worshiping a selfless
[1:13:15] powerless being
[1:13:17] so if i was you i'd quit worshiping you
[1:13:19] and shall worship in god
[1:13:21] because he's the only one that can help
[1:13:22] us out of the mess that we're in
[1:13:25] now people then notice this it was this
[1:13:28] that satan played upon eve in her state
[1:13:32] of ignorance as it was
[1:13:34] whenever he told her you shall be as
[1:13:37] gods now what did he offer her
[1:13:40] her being exalted above a place of
[1:13:44] understanding that god had already made
[1:13:45] man of god
[1:13:46] but it was he was offering something to
[1:13:48] her that it seemed like a mysterious
[1:13:51] something that she didn't know
[1:13:53] she didn't understand this she did not
[1:13:54] perceive it so he said you will be as
[1:13:57] god's own
[1:13:58] you mean i can be a god i can be a god
[1:14:00] can't you see why this
[1:14:02] age and scientific research and all the
[1:14:05] things that they've done
[1:14:06] why that most of the scientific people
[1:14:09] are above god
[1:14:10] they don't need god to believe in god is
[1:14:13] so puny so weak you know
[1:14:16] they look at us as morons and whatever
[1:14:18] more because we're not very scientific
[1:14:20] and we're not very smart
[1:14:22] poor brother donnelly he don't have no
[1:14:23] degrees and that's exactly right and i
[1:14:25] thank god i don't
[1:14:26] but if you can have one and still have
[1:14:28] faith praise the lord but if your degree
[1:14:30] ever comes against your faith don't get
[1:14:32] rid of your faith get rid of your degree
[1:14:35] so he offered them a godship so what so
[1:14:38] she could be able to worship something
[1:14:40] about herself so you mean
[1:14:41] i will become divine there will be
[1:14:44] something about me
[1:14:45] that will be so supernatural and so
[1:14:48] super spiritual
[1:14:49] and of course we know that he lied to
[1:14:51] her so then what happens is the truth of
[1:14:54] god
[1:14:54] is changed into a lie which is one of
[1:14:57] the prophecies of the last day
[1:14:59] and they will serve and worship the
[1:15:02] creature
[1:15:03] more than the creators that's your bible
[1:15:06] the book of romans
[1:15:07] so then the creator becomes
[1:15:10] what he becomes small unneeded
[1:15:12] insignificant
[1:15:13] all who needs god anymore who needs god
[1:15:16] anymore
[1:15:16] you know we've got science we can do
[1:15:18] this and that and tell me great
[1:15:20] scientists
[1:15:22] how many people have you let die a
[1:15:24] scientist
[1:15:26] was covered 19. tell me scientists why
[1:15:30] haven't you stopped guests
[1:15:32] yet tell me with all your laboratories
[1:15:36] why are people still getting old because
[1:15:39] god's word
[1:15:40] said they would is that right
[1:15:43] so no matter how much man wants him may
[1:15:46] make himself god
[1:15:47] he ain't no god he's deceived well
[1:15:50] praise the lord
[1:15:52] notice then so man shall be lovers
[1:15:55] of their own selves and then the second
[1:15:58] attribute to paul felt
[1:16:00] led to describe was covetous now the
[1:16:03] word
[1:16:03] use here for covetous is actually more
[1:16:06] more accurately rendered from the
[1:16:08] original
[1:16:08] is lovers of money so this is
[1:16:12] particularly the love of money so it's
[1:16:15] not just
[1:16:16] you know wanting this person's farm or
[1:16:18] this or that but
[1:16:19] it is more toward the root of this evil
[1:16:24] of the love of money the love of manny
[1:16:27] has been called the daughter of
[1:16:30] selfishness so covetousness
[1:16:34] would be something in the last day that
[1:16:36] would be a trademark or one of the signs
[1:16:39] of the time in first timothy chapter 6
[1:16:42] verse 10
[1:16:43] paul said for the love of money
[1:16:47] is the root of all evil
[1:16:50] now you hear people misquote this many
[1:16:52] times and they say that
[1:16:54] money is the root of all evil you're
[1:16:56] misquoting the bible
[1:16:58] the bible does not say money is the root
[1:17:01] of all evil
[1:17:02] but it is the love of money
[1:17:05] is the root of all evil now there are
[1:17:07] many rich people
[1:17:08] that god has entrusted with all kinds of
[1:17:11] money now i know most of you probably
[1:17:12] here
[1:17:13] do not think you are rich but i've been
[1:17:15] in many of the third world world
[1:17:16] countries
[1:17:17] uh you know in other places and believe
[1:17:19] me every one of you sitting here tonight
[1:17:20] or rich
[1:17:21] compared to them that's right but yet we
[1:17:24] know that there are some among
[1:17:25] us and even the message and in our ranks
[1:17:28] that would be considered rich but in
[1:17:30] reality
[1:17:31] they don't have the love of money
[1:17:33] they're able to take the money that god
[1:17:35] gives them and god and trust them with
[1:17:37] and they take that and send it here and
[1:17:39] books here and this that and the other
[1:17:42] help build churches and and many of them
[1:17:44] keep it to themselves they don't say one
[1:17:46] thing
[1:17:46] about it now if a person can do that
[1:17:49] that's quite a blessing from the lord
[1:17:51] but it's not money that is the root of
[1:17:53] evil but it is
[1:17:54] the love of money notice paul said for
[1:17:58] the love of money is the root of all
[1:17:59] evil
[1:18:00] which while some coveted actor they have
[1:18:03] aired from the faith so you imagine now
[1:18:05] we're not talking about cigarettes
[1:18:07] and we're not talking about tv
[1:18:08] pornography but just
[1:18:10] people that would so want money so bad
[1:18:14] and loved money so bad and coveted so
[1:18:16] much
[1:18:17] that somehow they would trade it out
[1:18:19] wonder how they done it well i might
[1:18:20] have started out but taking a second job
[1:18:23] it might have started out by working on
[1:18:24] a double shift and they started missing
[1:18:26] this service that service that service
[1:18:28] and another service before long they
[1:18:29] really didn't care if they went to
[1:18:30] church or not
[1:18:31] because they was making more money than
[1:18:33] they'd ever had in their life
[1:18:34] and they began to sell out and lose
[1:18:37] their faith
[1:18:38] why all for the love of money now why is
[1:18:41] it about money
[1:18:42] is it just to hoard the money itself for
[1:18:44] many it's not that
[1:18:45] it's simply that money is a script and
[1:18:48] money
[1:18:48] will be able to buy them the things they
[1:18:50] want so they want a bigger house they
[1:18:52] want a boat
[1:18:53] they want a four-wheeler they want this
[1:18:55] they want that they want that they want
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:57] so they've got to have money in order to
[1:18:59] get all these things
[1:19:01] that they want oh my goodness i i
[1:19:04] i must be at the wrong church folks i am
[1:19:06] so sorry i i thought i was going to
[1:19:08] preach to my church tonight
[1:19:12] y'all as quiet as a bunch of baptists
[1:19:15] oh my notice he said that while some
[1:19:19] have coveted after
[1:19:20] they have erred from the faith and
[1:19:22] pierce
[1:19:23] notice satan never done it
[1:19:27] they pierced themselves through
[1:19:31] with many sorrows look friends much of
[1:19:33] our battles one day you're going to look
[1:19:34] back and realize mine many of our
[1:19:36] battles were not even the devil doing it
[1:19:38] the devil was sitting down on hell
[1:19:40] eating an ice cream and drinking a glass
[1:19:42] of iced tea
[1:19:43] and you was doing it yourself either by
[1:19:45] your mouth or by your thoughts or by
[1:19:47] your negativism
[1:19:48] or by your love of money or whatever
[1:19:50] more you imagine a person then would
[1:19:52] pierce themselves
[1:19:53] don't we have enough piercing going on
[1:19:56] without us doing it to ourselves
[1:19:59] and pierce themselves through with
[1:20:02] many sorrows oh my notice that he moves
[1:20:06] on from
[1:20:07] covetous to boasters well for men
[1:20:10] shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:20:13] covetous
[1:20:14] boasters boasters
[1:20:17] self-assuming valuing themselves
[1:20:22] beyond all others
[1:20:27] i'm gonna go in the office my officer
[1:20:29] and preach the rest of this
[1:20:35] valuing themselves beyond all others
[1:20:39] those who attribute to themselves
[1:20:43] honor which does not fairly
[1:20:47] belong to them
[1:20:51] boasters of their wealth and riches
[1:20:54] of their honor and their grandeur
[1:21:00] my goodness and i'm sure you've noticed
[1:21:03] already
[1:21:03] i have not mentioned drinking i've not
[1:21:06] mentioned pornography
[1:21:08] paul never mentioned prostitution he
[1:21:11] never even mentioned abortion as
[1:21:13] horrible as that is
[1:21:16] you mean boasting is one of the signs of
[1:21:19] the end time
[1:21:20] of people thinking they are so elevated
[1:21:23] and they know so much or they're so
[1:21:25] smart
[1:21:26] or they're so much prettier or they have
[1:21:28] so much more money
[1:21:30] and they have this attitude that they
[1:21:32] look down on people beneath
[1:21:34] them because they're not in their social
[1:21:36] class or their status
[1:21:41] that's one of the 19 descriptions of the
[1:21:43] life's day spirit
[1:21:46] well praise the lord
[1:21:50] revelation 3 17 describes this very well
[1:21:54] because thou sayest
[1:21:57] i am rich and increase
[1:22:01] with goods and have need
[1:22:05] of nothing nothing
[1:22:08] brother that is a broad statement
[1:22:12] i have need of nothing nobody can tell
[1:22:16] me
[1:22:16] anything i don't need to listen to a
[1:22:19] preacher i've got everything i need on
[1:22:21] the tapes
[1:22:22] i'm as smart as any preacher that ever
[1:22:24] was on this earth you're a revelation
[1:22:26] laodicean 3 17.
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:31] praise the lord have need of nothing
[1:22:35] and know us not that thou art
[1:22:38] wretched and miserable and
[1:22:41] poor and blind
[1:22:45] and naked you see what self
[1:22:48] evaluation can do now they looked at
[1:22:51] themselves
[1:22:52] and they said i'm rich i'm increased
[1:22:56] with goods why look at me
[1:22:58] i absolutely don't need one thing
[1:23:01] not one thing but god's evaluation was
[1:23:07] they were blind they were wretched
[1:23:10] they were naked they were miserable
[1:23:14] and the worst thing about it was they
[1:23:17] didn't even know it
[1:23:19] so how in the world are you ever going
[1:23:21] to convince
[1:23:22] people like the first part of this
[1:23:25] phrase
[1:23:26] that they are actually the last part
[1:23:30] how are we ever friends for many we
[1:23:33] never
[1:23:34] will but think of it many of us
[1:23:37] and our former years of the church that
[1:23:40] we went to
[1:23:41] are in the status that we were in we
[1:23:44] were the first half of revelation 3
[1:23:46] 17. but god by his grace
[1:23:51] was able to help us see the last half
[1:23:55] of this verse and we were able to see we
[1:23:58] were wretched
[1:23:59] blind poor naked
[1:24:02] and miserable and we didn't even know it
[1:24:05] to grace open their eyes
[1:24:09] oh my why because
[1:24:13] boasting what does it tie back to the
[1:24:15] love
[1:24:16] of self and the estimation
[1:24:19] of oneself oh friends humility you know
[1:24:22] that's that that type of a word in this
[1:24:24] day we're living in
[1:24:26] so many self-help books so many books of
[1:24:29] how to
[1:24:30] you know love yourself and how to bring
[1:24:33] uplift yourself sure i understand that i
[1:24:36] understand that you've got to put
[1:24:38] yourself that's redeemed
[1:24:39] in the hands of god and you can be down
[1:24:42] on yourself and down on yourself
[1:24:44] that don't help your nobody else but
[1:24:45] whenever you are trying to lift your
[1:24:48] unregenerate self
[1:24:49] you're bragging on the wrong feller
[1:24:52] that's exactly right you're trying to oh
[1:24:55] self-help books with this and self-help
[1:24:57] for dummies
[1:24:58] and how to lift yourself up higher and
[1:25:00] how to be this
[1:25:01] how to be that don't you understand
[1:25:03] where all that's coming from
[1:25:04] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:25:08] well praise be to god notice in
[1:25:11] revelation 18
[1:25:12] 7 how this thing the same thing carries
[1:25:14] right on over to the consummation of
[1:25:17] this church
[1:25:18] how much he has glorified herself now
[1:25:21] this is the
[1:25:22] roman catholic church and lived
[1:25:24] deliciously so much torment
[1:25:26] and sorrow give her for she said in her
[1:25:30] heart i set a queen
[1:25:33] i am no little and shall see
[1:25:36] no sorrow now look at how the church
[1:25:40] and remember the protestantism will
[1:25:41] marry into catholicism
[1:25:43] and this will be the joint confession of
[1:25:46] all of those
[1:25:46] when it turns out of her into him
[1:25:50] remember there is a transition time it
[1:25:52] had to take place
[1:25:54] in the bride don't let the bright age
[1:25:56] term confuse you
[1:25:57] it's simply just the lifespan of time of
[1:26:00] the church age of laodicea
[1:26:02] it's not another age it's just that
[1:26:04] lifespan of time
[1:26:06] when we come out from being the church
[1:26:08] being recognized
[1:26:10] as the church being recognized that we
[1:26:12] were supposedly john 3 16 believers
[1:26:15] unworthy of grace and going to hell and
[1:26:18] this and that and the other
[1:26:19] and we come to an acknowledgement that
[1:26:21] we were not
[1:26:22] the church so much but we were the bride
[1:26:25] the called
[1:26:26] out the elected and even in the opening
[1:26:28] of the seals that the prophet would tell
[1:26:29] us
[1:26:29] i no longer call you church but i call
[1:26:32] you bride
[1:26:33] so what do we do we come out of the
[1:26:36] movement of her
[1:26:37] and we come in to him now we realize
[1:26:40] then that the church ages has been this
[1:26:42] movement of her
[1:26:43] but it will come in the very last
[1:26:46] increment of time
[1:26:47] in the laodicean church age that there
[1:26:49] is this span of time
[1:26:51] that people can come out of
[1:26:53] denominations
[1:26:54] and still be foolish virgin type and the
[1:26:57] prophet said
[1:26:58] it got to come out of her before it goes
[1:27:01] into him
[1:27:02] because when satan comes on the earth
[1:27:05] and this church
[1:27:06] merges into him there is no turning back
[1:27:09] you see once you come out of her into
[1:27:12] him
[1:27:13] there is no turning back and when the
[1:27:16] church
[1:27:16] the people that's able to make the
[1:27:18] foolish virgin when they come out of her
[1:27:20] before it goes into him
[1:27:22] satan there's still mercy for them but
[1:27:24] there before oh my
[1:27:26] before it goes into the consummation of
[1:27:28] the tribulation period
[1:27:29] it was changed from her to him and when
[1:27:33] it changes over to him
[1:27:34] he that is filthy is filthy still he
[1:27:37] that is holy
[1:27:38] is holy still what's this so men
[1:27:42] shall be lovers of their own selves and
[1:27:44] covetous and
[1:27:45] boasters and then he uses the word here
[1:27:48] proud
[1:27:49] the word here means haughty it is the
[1:27:53] attitude of a person who thinks they are
[1:27:56] better than others
[1:28:00] now let me tell you something tonight if
[1:28:01] you are privileged by the grace of god
[1:28:04] to see the reveal word of this hour the
[1:28:06] message of malachi 4 luke 17 revelation
[1:28:08] 10
[1:28:09] all that it has nothing to do with you
[1:28:11] being better than anybody else
[1:28:13] it's the grace of god
[1:28:17] they actually was contempt now in order
[1:28:20] to fulfill this
[1:28:21] this prophetic word here proud they
[1:28:25] must i'm not talking about something
[1:28:26] that you do and your your child will
[1:28:29] maybe knock a home run and or your child
[1:28:32] will you know do something in sports and
[1:28:34] and you're so proud and you go up to oh
[1:28:36] honey i'm so proud of you
[1:28:38] you made 100 in biology and you made 100
[1:28:40] in
[1:28:41] algebra one and you you i'm so proud of
[1:28:44] it that's not the type of pride that
[1:28:45] we're talking about
[1:28:46] uh but it's the pride that exalts
[1:28:50] your view of yourself and your status
[1:28:53] and it looks down on those that are
[1:28:56] beneath you
[1:28:57] maybe they aren't as privileged as you
[1:28:59] are financially or maybe even
[1:29:00] their revelation in the word that god
[1:29:03] has not
[1:29:04] entrusted them with the same scope of
[1:29:06] revelation that he has you
[1:29:08] and you have this about you that
[1:29:10] whenever you get around
[1:29:11] as well he don't know very much he's not
[1:29:13] very deep he's not you know so he kind
[1:29:15] of looked down
[1:29:15] do you understand your fulfilling second
[1:29:17] timothy 3 when you do that
[1:29:20] you see if god allows us to see
[1:29:23] something more
[1:29:24] than someone else it's god that did that
[1:29:26] it's not you
[1:29:28] it's not because you prayed so much and
[1:29:30] you you've done this well i deserve it
[1:29:32] you don't deserve one thing you deserve
[1:29:34] to go to hell
[1:29:35] as far as the flesh is concerned
[1:29:38] oh my god may god help us friends i
[1:29:41] don't want to be none of this to you
[1:29:42] now look we must take warning we
[1:29:46] must take warning this is not written to
[1:29:48] infidels this is not written diagnostic
[1:29:50] this is written to the believers this
[1:29:52] this letter is
[1:29:54] actually written to a man of god timothy
[1:29:57] this is written to a man of god and that
[1:30:00] man of god was going to take that word
[1:30:02] but wonder why timothy didn't go around
[1:30:04] and just read this
[1:30:07] but instead timothy went around and
[1:30:09] preached it
[1:30:12] that's why i don't go around just play
[1:30:14] tapes
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:16] because what i hear on them tapes is
[1:30:19] preach the word
[1:30:20] [Applause]
[1:30:22] hallelujah
[1:30:25] notice for men shall be lovers of their
[1:30:27] own selves
[1:30:28] covetous boasters proud
[1:30:34] blasphemers
[1:30:38] this don't mean what you think look at
[1:30:41] the meaning of this word
[1:30:43] speaking evil
[1:30:46] slanderous reproachful
[1:30:51] railing abusive
[1:30:56] so when people will slander a servant of
[1:31:00] god
[1:31:02] not just a preacher a servant of god
[1:31:07] when they will slander a christian
[1:31:10] a child of god you understand what
[1:31:13] they're doing
[1:31:14] blaspheming read your greek lexicon this
[1:31:17] is the word paul used
[1:31:21] speaking evil slanderous reproachful
[1:31:26] railing abusive so when people will put
[1:31:30] things about us me you the children of
[1:31:32] god whoever they are
[1:31:34] whether they are preachers or not and
[1:31:37] they will
[1:31:37] fabricate things and slander our name
[1:31:42] and run us down and trying to make us
[1:31:45] look
[1:31:45] evil they're blaspheming
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:53] now let's bring it on down a little
[1:31:55] farther if you do it
[1:31:57] so are you
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:32:00] oh my you know what friends we'd be a
[1:32:02] whole lot better off if we keep this
[1:32:04] thing right here in our mouths
[1:32:05] and keep them gates closed and keep him
[1:32:07] fingers right there off of a lot of
[1:32:09] keyboards if you ain't got enough sense
[1:32:10] to have facebook get rid of it
[1:32:13] if facebook makes you look like a dummy
[1:32:15] get rid of it
[1:32:18] amen mother johnny
[1:32:29] notice blasphemy matthew 12
[1:32:32] 31 wherefore i say unto you all manner
[1:32:35] of sin and blasphemy shall be
[1:32:37] forgiven unto men but the blasphemy
[1:32:39] against the holy ghost
[1:32:41] shall not be forgiven unto men and
[1:32:43] whosoever speaketh the word against the
[1:32:45] son of man
[1:32:46] it shall be forgiven him but whosoever
[1:32:50] speaketh against the holy ghost
[1:32:53] shall not be forgiven him neither in
[1:32:55] this world neither in the world to come
[1:32:57] so the spirit of god moving on us
[1:32:59] and we would shout and worship god and
[1:33:01] praise the lord
[1:33:03] the holy ghost moves on men of god to
[1:33:05] anoint them to pray for the sick
[1:33:06] and to lay hands on them and they cast
[1:33:08] out devils and they're healed
[1:33:10] and people would look at it or hear it
[1:33:12] and say that's an evil spirit
[1:33:14] you just crossed the line there's no
[1:33:17] hope for you
[1:33:20] because blasphemy is to call the work
[1:33:24] of god an evil spirit
[1:33:29] think about it now this is only one
[1:33:32] aspect by which blasphemy is addressed
[1:33:35] notice in romans chapter 2 verse 22
[1:33:38] thou that sayest to man should not
[1:33:40] commit adultery dost thou commit
[1:33:42] adultery
[1:33:43] thou that abhorrence titles dost thou
[1:33:45] commit
[1:33:46] sacrilege thou that make us thou boast
[1:33:49] of the law
[1:33:50] through breaking the law dishonores thou
[1:33:53] god for the name of god
[1:33:57] is bliss themed among the gentiles
[1:34:02] through you
[1:34:05] now you imagine that people can actually
[1:34:08] become the channel
[1:34:10] by which people blaspheme the name of
[1:34:13] god
[1:34:14] now here paul is not complementing those
[1:34:17] but he's actually rebuking them because
[1:34:19] they were saying
[1:34:20] don't you do this and don't you do that
[1:34:22] and he said and yet some of you turn
[1:34:24] around do the same thing that you say
[1:34:25] don't do
[1:34:26] and then other people will look at that
[1:34:29] and they're watching you
[1:34:31] and they actually blaspheme the name of
[1:34:33] god and say there's nothing to
[1:34:35] christianity
[1:34:36] there's nothing to jesus christ there's
[1:34:39] nothing to the cross there's nothing to
[1:34:41] the blood
[1:34:42] because look at what so and so does so
[1:34:44] they actually blaspheme
[1:34:46] through your false testimony
[1:34:53] wonder if we could social distance and
[1:34:55] have an altar call tonight
[1:34:58] i think we all might need to hit it
[1:35:01] my my for the name of god
[1:35:04] is blasphemed among the gentiles
[1:35:08] through you as it is written notice in
[1:35:11] titus 2
[1:35:12] 3 the aged women likewise that they be
[1:35:15] in behaviors becometh holiness
[1:35:17] not false accusers not given to much
[1:35:20] wine
[1:35:21] teachers of good things that they may
[1:35:24] teach the young women
[1:35:25] to be sober to love their husbands to
[1:35:28] love their children
[1:35:29] to be discreet chaste keepers at home
[1:35:33] good obedient to their own husbands
[1:35:36] that the word of god
[1:35:40] be not blasphemed so you mean
[1:35:45] christian women can actually
[1:35:48] by neglect in their life
[1:35:51] by not being the right kind of mother by
[1:35:54] not being the right
[1:35:56] kind of wife
[1:35:59] of course why would people blaspheme the
[1:36:02] name of god because you may be the only
[1:36:03] christian that they ever see
[1:36:06] and they see the way you live and they
[1:36:08] see what you do
[1:36:09] and they will look and say if that is
[1:36:11] christianity
[1:36:13] i want nothing to do with it while they
[1:36:16] lie and they cheat and they steal and
[1:36:18] they do this and that and the other
[1:36:20] and she gets on facebook and runs down
[1:36:23] everybody in the church
[1:36:25] and if that's christianity if that's
[1:36:28] what jesus does
[1:36:29] i don't want nothing to do with him and
[1:36:32] you imagine through the channel
[1:36:34] of your testimony they blaspheme the
[1:36:37] very
[1:36:38] name work and program of almighty god
[1:36:47] notice another aspect of blasphemy
[1:36:49] revelation 13
[1:36:50] 3 and i saw one of his heads as it were
[1:36:53] wounded to death
[1:36:55] and his deadly wound was healed
[1:36:58] and all the world wandered after
[1:37:01] the beast course it changes from
[1:37:04] romanism
[1:37:05] under the uh other aspect of the
[1:37:08] emperors
[1:37:08] unto the more spiritual supposed
[1:37:12] aspect of it and the deadly wound was
[1:37:14] healed and it raises back up with this
[1:37:17] great power
[1:37:18] and they worship the dragon which gave
[1:37:20] power
[1:37:21] unto the beast now the dragon is satan
[1:37:24] and they worshipped the dragon which
[1:37:26] gave
[1:37:26] power unto the beast and they worshiped
[1:37:29] the beast saying
[1:37:30] who is like unto the beast who is
[1:37:34] able to make war with him and that was
[1:37:37] given unto him a mouse speaking great
[1:37:39] things
[1:37:40] and blasphemies and power was given unto
[1:37:43] him
[1:37:44] to continue 40 and two months
[1:37:48] while this is going on on the earth
[1:37:50] you're enjoying a marriage supper
[1:37:53] and he opened his mouth and blasphemy
[1:37:56] against god to blaspheme his
[1:38:00] name and his tabernacle
[1:38:03] and them that dwell in heaven
[1:38:09] so you are gone the rapture is already
[1:38:12] completed
[1:38:14] he is still so mad he's blaspheming the
[1:38:18] name of god
[1:38:19] bless them and the tabernacle of god
[1:38:23] blaspheming you there you are
[1:38:26] in heaven dwelling in heaven
[1:38:30] can't you see when people get under a
[1:38:33] blasphemous
[1:38:34] anointing to ridicule to criticize
[1:38:38] they have nothing good to say their life
[1:38:41] is filled with bitterness
[1:38:42] and hatred can't you see how scary
[1:38:45] that is and yet many of those would
[1:38:48] never touch a cigarette
[1:38:50] they would never press a bottle of
[1:38:52] whiskey to their lips or a beer
[1:38:54] and they're as rotten and corrupt as the
[1:38:56] serpent himself
[1:38:58] because their life and their spirit and
[1:39:01] their attitude
[1:39:02] is so filled with bitterness and hatred
[1:39:06] may god help us
[1:39:10] if you're able stand to your feet
[1:39:25] oh my think of the children
[1:39:29] what a day to be living
[1:39:34] let me just read this verse two of two
[1:39:36] again for men shall be lovers of their
[1:39:38] own selves
[1:39:39] covetous boasters
[1:39:42] proud blasphemers
[1:39:46] disobedient to parents
[1:39:50] unthankful unholy
[1:39:54] of all the things that he could have
[1:39:56] described
[1:39:58] as i said where's prostitution where's
[1:40:01] homosexuality where's
[1:40:02] aborting babies he could have wrote that
[1:40:05] prophetically that wasn't even doing it
[1:40:07] at this time but he could have
[1:40:08] prophetically wrote it down if god
[1:40:10] wanted it
[1:40:11] but something like being disobedient to
[1:40:13] parents
[1:40:15] unthankful not appreciating things that
[1:40:19] god
[1:40:19] and people do for you and this is the
[1:40:22] attitude of laodicea
[1:40:25] you owe everybody something that's the
[1:40:28] attitude that people have you
[1:40:30] owe it to me and that's the way they
[1:40:32] come to god
[1:40:33] god you owe it to me if god gave you
[1:40:36] what he owes you you'd be burning
[1:40:37] tonight
[1:40:40] i'm telling my cause it's warm in this
[1:40:41] church
[1:40:43] but this is the attitude and this is
[1:40:46] what many people expect from their
[1:40:47] government
[1:40:48] many people don't want to work they
[1:40:50] don't want to provide i reckon they
[1:40:52] figure the government makes money the
[1:40:53] government does not make money
[1:40:55] the government takes taxes and they
[1:40:58] dispute
[1:40:58] distribute that tax money the government
[1:41:00] does not make money the government
[1:41:02] is not a money-making business they're a
[1:41:04] money blowing
[1:41:05] business but the mindset of so many the
[1:41:10] americans are what
[1:41:11] give me give me give me give me give me
[1:41:12] give me give me give me more than you
[1:41:14] give them give me give me give me give
[1:41:15] me more
[1:41:16] and many people come to church of the
[1:41:17] same attitude give me give me give me
[1:41:19] give me i want i want i want i want
[1:41:23] but the attitude of the lord jesus was i
[1:41:26] want to give away
[1:41:29] i want to give away it's not what can
[1:41:33] you give to me he didn't come and say
[1:41:35] what can you give to me larry what can
[1:41:38] you give to me gary
[1:41:40] but he said these words the son has come
[1:41:44] that you might have life and you might
[1:41:47] have it
[1:41:48] more abundantly
[1:41:51] guess what friends these things that
[1:41:54] we've read right here tonight if we stop
[1:41:55] and don't go any farther
[1:41:56] these things we've read right here
[1:41:57] tonight is split in many message
[1:41:59] churches
[1:42:01] you get a selfish person in there
[1:42:02] whether it's a businessman or a preacher
[1:42:04] or
[1:42:04] you know whatever it is he wants his own
[1:42:06] agenda and he's not willing to step over
[1:42:08] here and be what god wants him to be he
[1:42:10] wants to be the associate pastor wants
[1:42:12] to be this and that or the other
[1:42:13] same with musicians same with
[1:42:14] songwriters saying with whatever more
[1:42:16] they have their agenda they're never
[1:42:18] appreciated they're never
[1:42:20] used oh my their gifts are so great and
[1:42:22] well
[1:42:23] god just oh god just gifted them so much
[1:42:26] their attitude is what keeps them from
[1:42:27] going any farther
[1:42:28] they'll never go any farther me you i
[1:42:31] don't care who it is
[1:42:32] if brother branham would have had that
[1:42:34] attitude god would have

[1:43:44] than the skirt church
[1:43:47] we're this church hallelujah
[1:43:50] if we're just different by our skirts
[1:43:52] we're as lost as they are
[1:43:55] this is what helps us his word
[1:44:00] it's about our heads together
[1:44:05] lord jesus
[1:44:09] heavenly father
[1:44:13] lord god i pray first of all
[1:44:17] would you mind searching me first off

[1:44:52] keep me lord
[1:44:55] we live in this day and we rub shoulders
[1:44:57] with the people of the day but
[1:44:59] more than that we feel this influence
[1:45:02] around us
[1:45:03] in the world of demonology there's not a
[1:45:07] person here
[1:45:08] that hasn't dealt with some of these
[1:45:10] things if not many of them
[1:45:12] they feel it come against them
[1:45:15] sometimes they catch it and sometimes we
[1:45:17] don't
[1:45:18] but lord help us we don't want to be
[1:45:22] proud
[1:45:23] we don't want to be blasphemers we don't
[1:45:25] want to ridicule people and run them
[1:45:27] down and
[1:45:29] we know in the age that we're living
[1:45:30] people don't care one bit to do it
[1:45:32] not even based upon truth and facts
[1:45:36] as a matter of fact the truth is really
[1:45:38] not the greatest thing people want to
[1:45:40] promote in this day
[1:45:42] most people don't want truth it's too
[1:45:45] plain it's too
[1:45:46] too simple it has to be
[1:45:51] fabricated and more added to it and
[1:45:54] lies sell much much much more newspapers
[1:45:58] live sells many more videos and gets you
[1:46:01] a whole lot more hits on youtube that
[1:46:04] way you get
[1:46:05] paid back from youtube more for your
[1:46:07] advertisements
[1:46:08] so you get more money so it don't really
[1:46:10] matter if you have to stretch the truth
[1:46:12] just a little bit and you leave out this
[1:46:14] and that and the other because if you
[1:46:15] did that then that would
[1:46:17] fully expose your lives
[1:46:20] god we don't want pain we want to be
[1:46:23] honest straightforward
[1:46:25] faithful help us lord god
[1:46:29] we don't want to just be known by our
[1:46:31] skirts of our sisters
[1:46:33] the long hair we don't want to just be
[1:46:36] known because we don't drink beer and
[1:46:37] wine and
[1:46:38] oh that sort of thing we want the very
[1:46:42] word of god to be so living
[1:46:44] out of our lives but that old man is so
[1:46:47] dead
[1:46:49] he don't have no control over us anymore
[1:46:52] and there's a brand new nature living
[1:46:55] inside of us
[1:46:57] and we were reunited with
[1:47:00] another nature
[1:47:04] and we got our marriage certificate
[1:47:07] and that germ that was to be us
[1:47:10] was in us before the world began
[1:47:14] so there is a life that will follow that
[1:47:16] term
[1:47:18] i pray for those in the visible audience
[1:47:19] under the sound of my voice i pray for
[1:47:21] those lord god out on the internet
[1:47:23] those that will pull the service up lord
[1:47:25] whether wherever they are
[1:47:27] may you help them help each of us father
[1:47:30] that our lives can be able to answer
[1:47:34] these words we love you father
[1:47:38] forgive us if we've entertained these
[1:47:40] spirits forgive us lord
[1:47:43] if we've yielded our instruments
[1:47:46] it just amazes me that people think that
[1:47:49] all they have to watch is smoking and
[1:47:51] pornography lord some of these things
[1:47:54] right here have destroyed many more
[1:47:55] people than that
[1:47:57] help us god thank you lord jesus for
[1:48:00] coming
[1:48:01] to this earth and being a man and
[1:48:03] feeling our temptations
[1:48:06] and able to overcome every bit of it and
[1:48:08] say be of good cheer
[1:48:10] i have overcome the world
[1:48:14] we worship you tonight lord god
[1:48:17] i wonder how many of you with everhead
[1:48:19] bowed
[1:48:20] and those of you that mean it from the
[1:48:22] sincerity of your heart
[1:48:24] you would just like to raise your hand
[1:48:26] to the lord jesus
[1:48:28] and by that you're going to say lord
[1:48:30] help me to be the right kind of a person
[1:48:33] if i've done one or two or many of these
[1:48:36] things
[1:48:37] forgive me lord if i've been proud
[1:48:40] arrogant if i've looked down on others
[1:48:43] forgive me lord i i didn't realize
[1:48:46] lord that it it was this this wrong i
[1:48:49] didn't realize it was this serious i'm
[1:48:51] sorry
[1:48:52] if there's christians in our church or
[1:48:54] christians in other church and i've
[1:48:56] looked down on them because their
[1:48:57] clothes and
[1:48:58] maybe their shoes had holes in them and
[1:49:01] they were ragged and
[1:49:02] the car they drove and i really just had
[1:49:05] a bad attitude toward them
[1:49:07] forgive us lord forgive us lord god if
[1:49:11] we've
[1:49:12] slipped up and people have looked at us
[1:49:14] and said you mean that's a christian
[1:49:17] forgive us lord god if we've ever
[1:49:20] displayed
[1:49:20] pride arrogance in a wrong way father
[1:49:25] help us lord we want to be under this
[1:49:27] spirit of the last days
[1:49:29] that's holy filled with love
[1:49:33] we want to trade hard-headedness and
[1:49:35] stubbornness
[1:49:36] and rebellion for submission and love
[1:49:40] and forgiveness lord jesus we want to be
[1:49:43] like you
[1:49:44] your prophet would come when he would go
[1:49:46] to preach that
[1:49:48] absolute astounding sermon perfect faith
[1:49:51] and the scriptures that he would read
[1:49:54] and say
[1:49:54] if you do not forgive men their
[1:49:56] trespasses neither will your father
[1:49:58] forgive yours
[1:49:59] and then he would make this comment so
[1:50:01] we see
[1:50:02] that faith is based upon forgiveness
[1:50:07] so we'll never be able to move into the
[1:50:09] realm of perfect
[1:50:10] face as long as we're holding grudges
[1:50:14] and someone said something against us
[1:50:16] and we think about it
[1:50:17] and mull over it and it may be a year it
[1:50:20] may be two
[1:50:21] it may be three but we will wait for the
[1:50:24] opportunity
[1:50:25] to get back at him help us to realize
[1:50:28] lord that's not your nature
[1:50:29] that's not your spirit that's satan
[1:50:32] anointing
