So then back in June, I ended back up in the hospital, my colon acting up. The nurse practitioner said, "You just had an angry colon." And they tested me for uh ulcerated colitis, IBS, and uh Crohn's. And so he was thinking I had Crohn's and everything, but they said I had 10 inches of my colon had come out. So back in uh July, he took 10 inches out. But you know what? I'm still here today and I thank God. And I had another colonoscopy. I had four of them this year.

Oh, God. How we so feel humbled and small in your presence when you come among us, Lord, and make your way known, your will known to us. And then to see that you have included us in your great program. Father, we just want you to know that we love you and we adore you. We magnify you. &gt;&gt; We cannot wait to finally be able to see you. Lord, we're just happy that it's Wednesday again. I told Carol before church, I said, "I'm just so glad to be able to be in church again." Oh, Father, it's such an honor and a privilege. What a great privilege it is, Jesus. We love you. Help us tonight. Father, speak to us from your word. Father, you see this request that was just turned in. Dear God, Brother Marty McMord and Lord, pastored a little church there in Arkansas. Pray that you'd be with them as well. Granted, dear Father, anoint us tonight, Lord, as we look into your word in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, there was a wasp that flew on my nose and stung me on the hand. So, I say we go ahead and have church while y'all say. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Genesis 24:1. Praise the Lord. And Abraham was old and wellstricken in age. And the Lord blessed Abraham and all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, "Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son, of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom among whom among whom I dwell. But it didn't say he was one of them. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he was just in the same culde-sac &gt;&gt; or the same vicinity. That's the way we are. We are not of this world. &gt;&gt; But thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. And the servant said unto him, Perventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must thy needs bring thy son again unto the land from which thou camest? And Abraham said unto him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again. the Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, which spake unto me, that swear unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He shall send his angel before thee. He shall send his angel, not a host, not angels and plural, but his angel before thee. and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. May the Lord bless his word. You may be seated. The first time that we actually can see that angels appeared in the Old Testament in the relation to man in the scripture is the very last verse of Genesis chapter 3. But it's not a very good setting for the Bible tells us that God drove the man out of the Garden of Eden and that he put cherubams on the east side outside of Eden. And they had a flaming sword and they was turning every way to protect the way back to the tree of life. That's right. And then we go for many years before we see an angelic visitation again that God is bringing down heaven to the constituents of the earth and helping them to be reconciled back. Part of our dowy is going to be our heavenly identification that will strengthen us. Sometimes they will also bring healing. They will bring encouragement. &gt;&gt; They will bring all different kinds of things to us on our journey. And it is a witness to us that we have a heavenly identification that goes beyond just this mortal life. Now, of course, angels appeared many times in the Old Testament. In retrospect, as we we read the New Testament and we start in the Gospels and we can see Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And for us looking at it backwards, it makes the picture so clear. But had we lived in that first century, four, five, 6 AD, something like that, for us to have been there, no doubt we would have not known the great things that were transpiring because there was no social media. There was no printed New Testament for about 50 to 60 years after the Lord Jesus had left from the earth or it would have been probably actually 25 leaving 33 and the first one was around 56. So it would have been 20 20 something years before they had apprented New Testament. So by word of mouth, there might have been a few people that would have heard some talk that angels had been appearing on the earth and there was certain people that these angels was coming to and making things known to them. Now no doubt it would have been very odd and very strange because the angels had not appeared like this at all in this consequence even in the Old Testament. Now they would appear and it would go years before anybody would see another one. And then one would appear again. It would go years. It might be hundreds of years before anyone would see another angel of God. And then it would be restricted many times to prophets that God would send his mighty angels to the common average person. Very very few instances in the scripture. But yet when we look at the New Testament, it was a breaking of what God was fixing to do because the son of man, the ladder from heaven, was fixing to anchor down on the earth and latch a hold of the throne of God in heaven. and the angels would start ascending and descending on the son of man. So before he actually is ever born and brought to the earth, this angelic appearance starts happening. It's phenomenal really. Let's read Luke 1 verse 5. Now, I want you to notice that I I checked it before I came out there just a bit ago that the angel Gabriel, his name is mentioned four times in the Bible. The first time is in the book of Daniel. The second time is the book of Daniel. But the third time is what we're going to read right now in the book of Luke. So, the first two times made known to a prophet. But now God is going to break that pattern that it's not going to be a prophet. It's going to actually be a priest. And the next time it'll be a woman. Luke chapter 1 verse 5. There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea a certain priest named Zacharias and of the course of Abia. And his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth. and they both were righteous before God. Now, I want you to remember these portions of this verse. So, they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless. So, they are walking before God perfect. But notice what they're walking in. And they're in this stage of what God call righteous and blameless. So both were righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and the ordinances which was thou shalt, thou shalt not, thou shalt, thou shalt not. You can't go here. You cannot mix in your garment woolen and lenon. Don't s sew diverse seed in your garden. Don't do this. Don't do that. And they were blameless when it come to that. But now watch how people can be blameless when it comes to commandments and ordinances and miss it when God does a new thing. &gt;&gt; They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless. They had no child because Elizabeth was barren and they both were now wellstricken in years. And it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course. Now notice everything is exact. He would have been a punctual sort of a guy. He would have been a guy that was right on time, everything dressed exactly, pomegranates, garments clean, hands washed, feet washed, everything would been perfect to the dot. According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. Isn't it strange how God picks certain sides to do certain things? I'm sure you've noticed it that brother Brandon would bring the prayer line from the right side. The right side so much in the scripture was pointed out. Now watch. So the angel appears on the right side of the altar of incense and he appeared at a certain place. Why? Why the altar of incense? Why not the manora, the seven brain candlestick? Why not the ark of the covenant? dispensationally. He appeared at the right place. Why? The people on the outside are praying. What's Zachcharias doing? Offering incense. He appears exactly in the right season. Had he been beyond the veil, Zachcharias would have never seen him. &gt;&gt; So the angel of God, which is Gabriel, came exactly to where he was. And the people couldn't come into there, but they were paralleled that on the outside. They were all praying together. Oh, I wonder what could happen right here tonight if we'd all get in that same attitude. &gt;&gt; And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said unto him, "Fear not, Zachcharias, for thy &gt;&gt; prayer." So he appears at the altar of s incense. Remember when the great ornament of furniture that was seen there in heaven and what was it? The prayers of the saints. For thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John, and thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth, for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. Now, I want you to notice how the angel of the Lord, Gabriel, is going to place John and divide the Elijah mantle of Malachi 4 in two parts. Now, watch what he tells him. many of the children of Israel. He shall turn to the Lord their God. For he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. But Malachi 4 says, "Turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers." wonder why the angel of God didn't quote that latter part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, for those of those who have left this message and try to say John the Baptist fulfilled the same thing, you're lying. &gt;&gt; I said you are lying. &gt;&gt; Gabriel said he would fulfill the first part. I'm going to take Gabriel over some beardrinking, shortwearing, backsliding man that's walked away from the end time message &gt;&gt; or some preacher standing up that thinks he knows more about it than a God called prophet and word of life said &gt;&gt; you want to take this one's idea that's idea go ahead and do what you want to do. I'm going to take Gabriel's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to take what Gabriel said over some theologian that thinks he knows more about it. No, I figure Gabriel knows much more about it than I do &gt;&gt; or any of you. &gt;&gt; Now notice, he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just and leaves out with divine intent and purpose that he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. So he slices that prophecy right in half. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And divided Isaiah 61 by 2,000 years of a prophetic timeline. [crying] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You know how blessed you are to see that tonight &gt;&gt; to make uh ready [laughter] a people prepared for the Lord. And Zachchariah said unto the angel, "Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the angel said unto him, I am &gt;&gt; Gabriel. that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee these glad tidings, and behold, thou shalt be dumb. Tell me how a sinless, blameless, perfect man. Come on, brother &gt;&gt; could not see such a thing. Can't you see how good people can be totally blind &gt;&gt; as God changes from one dispensation to another? &gt;&gt; Now, this is in your Bible. This man was blameless until this. &gt;&gt; Now, he's no longer blameless. Brother Daryl, the angel of God tells him who he is and tells him because of what you have said. Now, it was not just that he asked a question. It's the attitude he asked it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. All right. &gt;&gt; And Zachariah said unto the angel, "Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years." And the angel answered and said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto thee to show thee these glad tidings, and behold, thou shalt be dumb. [clears throat] Well, I'll tell you one thing. It's probably a good thing that Gabriel ain't here today striking everybody that has questions and doubts about the message of the hour. Cuz probably beginning at the pull pit to the back, none of us will be talking for a long time. &gt;&gt; I don't know that might be a good thing sometimes as much as we rattle in much trash as we talk. &gt;&gt; A blameless, perfect man that obeyed the commandments and the ordinances. And thou shalt, and thou shalt not, and thou shalt have this, and thou shalt, and thou shalt. And now God was doing something like he had never done before. And the man missed the present tense angelic visitation. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Behold, thou shalt be done and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed. Now I want you to listen to this. Because thou believest not &gt;&gt; my words. &gt;&gt; Now if Zacharias said I'll tell you what I want a scripture. &gt;&gt; I want you to show me a scripture where it mentioned my name and my wife's name and I'll believe it. You ain't got no word where I can trace it back to the Old Testament and prove it. Where is there even a John in the prophecy? &gt;&gt; There ain't no such a name. I I I I'm challenging you by the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Watch it know it all. &gt;&gt; Cuz you'll find out you don't know it all. &gt;&gt; And not only that, you may not be able to speak what you do know. &gt;&gt; The same angel that can open your mouth can shut it, &gt;&gt; can't he? Now watch. Because thou believest not &gt;&gt; whose words? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; So when God sends an angel &gt;&gt; and people refuse &gt;&gt; to accept that angel's message, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Dangerous thing, friends. because thou believest not my words. Now I want you to listen to the perfection of God's word which shall be fulfilled in their season. Now I'm going to say something right now that's going to blow some of you away. There are words that God has allocated in his people's lives that he knew must be on divine sovereign promise whether or not you even believe it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sarah never did believe. The prophet said she never did believe it. If it was left up to us, us and our weak measly faith, we still wouldn't get off the ground. There ain't no way in the world. You know how there's going to be a bride there? Divine sovereignty of God has already spoke. There is a bride and nothing, including herself, will ever stop her from being here. Because you and I would look at this, well, I don't understand. We have this question. Well, what about that? What about that? What about that? But God says, "My word will be fulfilled." And there ain't nothing going to stop it. Time ain't going to stop it. The world ain't going to stop it. Our fears ain't going to stop it. Our anxiety ain't going to stop it. And that's the way with the allocation of certain divine promises. There ain't enough devils in hell. There ain't enough preachers in the pull pit. There ain't enough unbelievers in the world. His word will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. I thought that if we didn't believe certain things said about us, it couldn't happen. &gt;&gt; Well, that's true to a degree, &gt;&gt; but there's certain things that God knows how we are, &gt;&gt; and there's certain things that he gives to you, and if you don't believe them, they won't happen. But when it comes to your destiny, it's already been predetermined. For those whom he did forno, he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son. And the original digot says it this way, for whom he did forno, he did previously mark out copies of the likeness of the son of himself. previous mark out copies of the likeness of the son of himself. He could not leave my destiny up to my free moral agency. Oh, I know some of us are free will Baptist, but it comes right down to it. Boy, my free will. Glory to God. I went down to the altar and I grabbed a hold of the horns. No, you didn't. God grabbed a hold of your horns and shook the devil out of you and absolutely converted you and smacked you up the side of the head and said, "You're a son of God. You're a daughter of God. You're not going back to the world, but Lord, I want to." He said, "I said you're not going back no more, but God, I can't do it." Yes, you can. But God, I'm too weak. No, you're not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's the way [screaming] our God does it. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled. And yet part of those words were words about him, brother Daryl. And he didn't even believe what the angel said about him. How you know that, brother Donnie? That's the very thing that he threw back in the angel's face. I'm [screaming] old. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I can't do this. There's no way. He was doubting God's word about him and about his wife that it couldn't happen. The angel of God said, "All right, boy. You're going to be dumb." &gt;&gt; There's a lot of dumb folks in the world we're living in. &gt;&gt; And it ain't their tongue. &gt;&gt; It's her supernatural intelligence. Huh? You're going to be dumb because of this. But the word [screaming] I spoke &gt;&gt; shall be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now let us move from Elizabeth and Zachcharias to Luke chapter 1 26. I find this amazing because Luke remember was not actually in the message as we'd say at that time. So Luke was a Jew, but he was raised and cultured in the gentile ways. Speak many, many languages, educated, doctor. So Luke didn't come around till sometime later. Now, according to the Bible, we're not supposed to accept anything without two or three witnesses. &gt;&gt; So I'd like the second and third witness &gt;&gt; that Gabriel came to Zacharias. Come on. &gt;&gt; I love it when the Lord does that. I mean, it just I just love it. He loves to fry that devil's hide. I want to know who else said this happened beside Luke. Do y'all believe this is the Bible? &gt;&gt; Do you accept it as holy scripture? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But we've only got one man's word for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that one man wasn't even there. &gt;&gt; So y'all accept it? &gt;&gt; All right, I'll go ahead and read the rest of it then cuz he's also the only one that says this one this way. &gt;&gt; That's why I have no problem when God sends a prophet messenger to the earth and he preaches the seals and says all kinds of things that other people didn't say. I have no problem accepting that myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, notice Luke 1:26. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God, and to a city in Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin espouseed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou art highly favored, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what matter of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary." Oh, so this angel knew people's names. &gt;&gt; He did not have to ask them their name, did he? &gt;&gt; He could tell them their name. &gt;&gt; Yes, he could. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I've been sharing some this week of some discernments that I found. I'd sure like to share them with the rest of you sometime, too. When God's prophet would call people out, tell them their first name, middle name sometimes and last name. Tell them what was wrong with them. Tell them what their house number was, what street they lived on, what city they were from. And in one of them that I'd sent around, he told them the area because he was singing it in a vision where they were coming from and it was a lake or a body of water and described how it was coming into this country and it was Paduca, Kentucky. Another one was a small place in Missouri and he calls the name of that place Kennet, Missouri. Well, I can tell you even to this day, if you blink your eyes and you go through Kennet, you ain't even going to see it. I can't imagine what it was. Right, brother Daryl. Brother Daryl's been through there many, many times. Uh, but yet God was so particular and the way that he would have Why was this done, friends? So we could recognize the Lord Jesus was here, not William Brandham. the Lord Jesus, it was his ministry on the earth that had come to call out a bride. &gt;&gt; Now, had it been only the signs and the wonders, then we would have known right then there was something wrong. God never sends that type of phenomenon without bringing a message. The phenomenon will come first and the phenomenal events will start happening. It's in order to get the attention of the people and the messenger is baiting the hook. So the hook is hanging there. It's hanging there bare and it's hanging there exposed. And God will send a sign and he will send a miraculous and the supernatural and he will cover the hook so the fish will not see it. And then the spirit of God will launch it out into the water and he'll go to reeling in. Now what's he looking for? a rainbow trout. A rainbow trout. But you see that rainbow trout will run away from a bare hook. So you've got to have bait on that hook. [clears throat] What does the devil try to do? Try to impersonate that supernatural phenomena in order to take away and make the real look smaller. Oh hallelujah. Now watch the angel Gabriel how he deals with a woman. Not a preacher, not an evangelist, not a teacher, but a woman. Oh my. Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David. He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever. And his kingdom of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then Mary said unto the angel, Mary, you're going to question. Now, Zacharias raised a question &gt;&gt; and got in big trouble. That's right. &gt;&gt; But Mary's going to ask a question and ain't going to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonder what the difference is. Attitude. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She's being honest. She's not asking that question out of unbelief. &gt;&gt; You see, that's what Satan loves to do when people go to question the message. Well, I don't understand this. How come that? I can't put that together. and they go to web pages and websites and they go to talking to a bunch of unbelieving devils and won't even talk to their pastor, won't even talk to godly men of God, but they hang around that bunch of garbage out there that's as polluted and hellbound as they can be. Come on, somebody. Let's have church tonight. You're not even doing something sainely by asking men of God who've given their entire life for this message, for this word. and you'll go to websites and go to read this book and that book. Why don't you come and talk to men of God that you've seen God heal the sick through their hands and seen God raise the dead right in this very church building and you'll talk to unbelievers and infidels and agnostics. Come on children. I said come on children. If you're going to have something there and you got a question, come to men of God that God can help lead you in the right way. Mary was not smitten because you had a question because she was asking in sincerity, not in doubt. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, when Judas saw the high expensive perfume that was poured on Jesus head and on his feet &gt;&gt; and he looked at it and said, "How come this waste? This could have been sold for, you know, how muchever it was. It could have been sold and given to the poor." And John knew him well by this time. And he said, "Not that he cared for the poor, but he was a thief." So Judas asks his questions too. I like to look at where the question is coming from. A sincere heart that's trying to understand or the heart of an unbeliever, an infidel that only wants to argue and debate. I'm not going to spend too much time answering them kind of questions cuz it's basically a waste of time. &gt;&gt; I'll spend day and night. God knows it's the truth. I have spent hours and hours and hours trying to find answers to people's questions. If I feel it's sincere, but if I feel it's not sincere and I pray over them and God just pulls it away from me, I'm not going to waste hardly no time at all. Why should I? I get that one answer, they'll give me another. And I get that one answer, they'll give me another. And I become so consumed and trying to answer the questions of people that don't believe in the first place, I take away from those who really do believe, and I could help them. I'm not going to cast my pearls before swine. So go on, Sue. Stay away from me. I'm not interested in feeding hogs. I want to feed sheep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then said Mary unto the angel, how how shall this be seeing? &gt;&gt; I know not a man. Now look at what Zachcharias said. How can this be? I I'm older. My wife is old. And what's Mary doing coming right back? How can this be? I've never known a man. She's going to the flesh just like Zacharias did. But there was a difference in the heart. And the an angel answered and said unto her, "Thou shalt be dumb. Two people asked two questions. Neither one of them understood. One of them got smoked dumb for nine months. The other one received the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And the angel answered and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age. This is the sixth month was her who was called barren. For with God nothing &gt;&gt; shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; And Mary said, &gt;&gt; "Behold the handmade of the Lord. be it unto me. The Bible did not give us her name in Isaiah that she would have to receive by an angelic message and hear her name called through that angel's &gt;&gt; message. Oh yeah. G. &gt;&gt; Now notice, it was not the mighty Elohim himself that come down and call Mary, &gt;&gt; but he sent an angel messenger. &gt;&gt; And the angel messenger called her by name. &gt;&gt; You know, in other words, saying something like this, I'll no longer call you church, &gt;&gt; but I'll call you bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when them word, that seals comes open, then you're hearing your name. Am I hearing Donnie Reagan? Are you hearing Rob Weber? Are you hearing Lance Parker? Harry Reagan, Karen Reagan. Is that what you're hearing? You're hearing your word name. When that word speaks to something that you finally found your true identity, maybe she's always an odd girl, 16 years old. Maybe she's always different and unusual and she didn't know what it was. But when she heard that prophecy, there was something about it. and through that angel's message. Hallelujah. And he told her, "This is the way it's going to be, Mary. You're not going to work your way into it. You're not going to pray your way into it. You're not going to fast your way into it. The Holy Ghost will come upon you." Let me tell you something, little bride. Yes. Pray. Read your Bible. God lays it on your heart to fast. Fast. But you're not going to get it by your works. You know how we're going to leave this world? The Holy Ghost is going to come upon us. The spirit of God will bring the power of the rapture. And it's been given to us by an angel's message. [applause] &gt;&gt; And Mary said, "Behold, the handmade of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word." She trusts him so much. Notice she didn't say the Torah. She didn't even quote Isaiah and say according to the book of Isaiah because Isaiah never personally identified her by name. Jenny, can you see it? &gt;&gt; Can't you see what God has done for you &gt;&gt; by sending you a message in [screaming] the last day that would be so personal to you, you'll never get away from it. I don't care what you do, wherever you ever go. &gt;&gt; It's so personally to you. There's nothing. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. The real bride in this age has it just as powerful as Mary had it then. Brother Daryl, you'll never talk them out of it. You'll never threaten them out of it. You'll never buy them out of it. They can't get out of it. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. [applause] Be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word. And they see all these lights and these saucers, flying saucers they call them, and they wonder what it is. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, little children. One of these days, one of them will drop right down into that &gt;&gt; and change it. It won't be hide or hair nor bones left behind. &gt;&gt; You'll be changed in a moment. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, look with me again in Matthew 1:18. This is after the immaculate conception. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on the with this wise one as his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they came together and was she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. That's what I'm wanting everybody in this church this same portion of the word right here can be said about you &gt;&gt; that you're found with child &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man, not willing to make her a public example, but was minded to put her away private. Now remember, they were just engaged, betrothed, but the betroal was law-abbbinding. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream. I want you to notice how different that God comes to him than he did to Zachcharias or to Mary. He still sends an angel, but now it's an angel in a dream. And it's not a dream that needs interpretation. So, we don't look over here and there's three stars over there and there's four donkeys over there and there's five moon pies over here and six RC's and then there's a, you know, a little table that's got Tonka toys and and it's got all these symbols and all that. What did you eat for supper? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. You can't believe some of the dreams that people send me sometime and they just know it means something. I know it means something, too. But it ain't got nothing to do with God. Come on, somebody. I know there's some of the people in the message just simply don't believe it. And the further we go, the more I I realize even some of the preachers in the message don't believe what the prophet said. That if it is a dream from God in this day, there is no prophet in the land to interpret it. So it will be a dream like Joseph had. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary, thy wife. &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. They're just engaged. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They've not even met under the tent yet. They've not even drank the last cup of wine. They She's not even been sent for to go to the house that he's built her. But the angel of God recognized betroal on that engagement. Binding? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what Joseph is going to do? Divorce her? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife of that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And then Joseph wakes up and said, "Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. What she's been telling me is the truth. &gt;&gt; I was having a hard time believing. I I just I just couldn't hardly believe." So the angel appeared to a bride. &gt;&gt; He did. And the bride conceived of the word and the bride was telling people about it, but a lot of the people was having a hard time believing it. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; That the bride had actually become pregnantated by the Holy Ghost. Praise the Lord, somebody. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe the last call before the birth of the word in flesh will be some of those who struggling and the final voice to the final age will be the bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know some of our message folks don't like that quote. None. I love it myself cuz it reads me and you in the script. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we're the last actors on the scene. Now watch verse 23. Quoting the scripture, behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and called his name Jesus. So God appeared to him in this angel had formed and it was so real to Joseph. He done exactly what the angel said. Now watch in Matthew chapter 2 11. And when they were come, we're talking about the magi now. And they're coming after Jesus has been born. Actually a little while after Jesus had been born. That's right. &gt;&gt; And when they were come into the house, &gt;&gt; not into the cavemen &gt;&gt; where he was born, &gt;&gt; they come into the house, &gt;&gt; they saw the young child, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; not a newborn baby. &gt;&gt; This is what your Bible says. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; They saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts, gold, and frankincense and myrr. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And if you ever meet Jesus right and give him the proper gifts, you'll go back to your country another way than when the way you come to him. You come to him lost. You come to him wretched. You come to him in a mess. But when you meet him, oh, glory to God. I feel like preaching a little bit right now. And you give the Lord Jesus your gifts. Amen. He will send you back to your country another way than the way you come. Aren't you glad you're different, friends? You've been changed by the power of God. He's sending us another way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appearth to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt. and be thou there until I bring thee word. So you imagine now an angel of God is bringing a message for him to flee. But the same angel ain't going to leave him there. The same angel will be sent back from the throne of God to tell him it's time to come back home &gt;&gt; and there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. Now notice after Herod was dead Matthew 21:19. But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appearth in a dream. Ain't this something? Joseph has three visitations in his dream. His subconscience and it was an angel every time. We have no record that an angel actually appeared in a visible form. Now, some of you may be terrified of these things I've been preaching on Wednesday night thinking that an angel of God is going to appear before you. Don't worry. God knows exactly how to deal with each one of us. And God knows exactly how to make us. So, we're able to correspond to the supernatural. But this was just as much God as the other instances that happened. But this is the way God called Joseph. And this was his divine channel of communication by which God could speak to him. Praise the Lord. But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph and Egypt, saying, "Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead, which sought the young child's life." Now, let's move from from this to Luke 2:8. Look at all the angelic visitations that we've seen in a period of 6 months, a year, a year and a half, two years, one after another after another after another. It's a sign something's fixing to happen at the birth of Jesus. And they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel [sighs] of the Lord came upon them. Now remember what these guys were. Humble, poor peasant shepherds. There was the kings, the potentates, the great high priest, the great holy s Sanhedrin. And God sent an angelic choir in order to sing to humble shepherds. Why? It had to be shepherds. And the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them. Can you imagine these guys? Nobody's, brother Darl. Absolute nobodies. And yet the angel of the Lord come upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you." Oh, you mean so an angel can tell you things that are to be &gt;&gt; an angel can bring you things that are prophetic. &gt;&gt; This shall be a sign, oh hallelujah, unto you. You shall find the babe. Notice the difference of the terminology here, babe, versus the term in Matthew, child. Look at it in the Greek and you'll find out that the other one is an infant. It's not a baby. So, it's several years old. This shall be a sign unto you, and you'll find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. It don't say about the magi finding him in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. I know, I know, I know this is not tradition. I ain't worried about tradition. I want truth. You ain't going to find this in the manger scene. I've said it many years ago. You know, if I was going to have a modern-day major scene in front of my house, you know what I'd do? I'd get me a blowup mattress and go out there and lay in the yard and say, "Here it is. Right here is the current manger scene." Because deity ain't in heaven. It's in me. Deity ain't in heaven. It's in you. Jesus is no longer in a manger. I'm telling you, he's here in the bride's body. He's here in the blind flesh. But, brother Donnie, we're weak human beings. Yes, we are. And that's what makes it so awesome. That's what makes it so glorious. &gt;&gt; And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the babe wrapped in swirling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host. &gt;&gt; Praising God. Can you imagine them old boys looking around? Now keep in mind when they would go into town, everybody knew what these guys done cuz they smelled like sheep. They say that them shepherds was around the sheep so much that even when they laughed that their laugh was like a sheep. [laughter] [clears throat] Oh Lord God, can't you see why Jesus come to the earth? He wanted to learn to laugh like him. &gt;&gt; And them shepherds smelled like sheep. &gt;&gt; God in heaven in spirit form did not smell like a sheep. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But Jesus wanted to come down to the earth and learn to laugh like us, but also learn to cry like us. Did the world need another carpenter? He who made the worlds? &gt;&gt; Did the world [screaming] need another fisherman? &gt;&gt; Him that would go out and cast a net into the sea and all he would had to have done was spoke to the sea and say, "Empty out." I'm talking about our father that could have put a patent on the seven colors in the rainbow. He could put a copyright on the Robin song. He could put a copyright on the cardinal song. He could put a patent and ownership on this and that and the other cuz it all belongs to him. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. And yet he come down to the earth and didn't even have a place to lay his sin. Had to borrow a womb to be born in. Had to borrow a grave to be buried in. But he ain't having to borrow nothing tonight. We give it to him. Hallelujah. [screaming] We will not make him beg for our heart. We will not make him beg for room. &gt;&gt; We say, "Come in, Lord Jesus." Listen what they were singing now. Glory to God in the highest. On earth peace, good will toward men. It came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass." Notice how they say it. Is come to pass. It's present tense. It's unfolding. &gt;&gt; It's coming to pass. &gt;&gt; They realized they were part of what was coming to pass. Oh Lord God, may I may we look tonight, Brother Joe, and see we are part of what is coming to pass. Yes, we are part of the past and we're part of the future, but we are part of the present. This is our time. We are the actors on the scene. Friends, &gt;&gt; listen to this. Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. Listen to this. And there's a man can turn on the light. You know, when a king is born, they have seen great carrying on. When the king is born, &gt;&gt; he was so secretly born, born in a stable in a manger where the cattle and the horses were eaten. But yet he was a king. And the angels came down and sang the hymns to the shepherds. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So they didn't go to the temple and to sing to Annus and Capus, Pontius Pilate or Herod or whoever all the great people were of that day, but they went to shepherds. You see, God still believes in shepherds. &gt;&gt; And the angels came down and sang the hymns. I'm sorry. I know I think different, but as I was reading this, I thought, what hymns would it have been? &gt;&gt; You imagine them poor guys that the rich wouldn't even speak to them. They would have nothing to do with them. And they're they're setting being entertained by angels. They were the audience to hear the songs at the king's birth. &gt;&gt; So if there's a choir director in the angelic band and him getting his stick or whatever they did and him said, "All right, ready everybody ready on a capella now." Or they might have harps and horns. I'm not sure. Oh Lord have mercy. That'd kill a church of Christ, wouldn't it? Dear God, to think that instruments up in heaven. But there they say the the the shepherds around said, "Where's the audience?" You all are. &gt;&gt; But we've never even been to a concert. Most of the time we're not allowed to go in church cuz we we ain't got very good clothes. But today you are going to be serenated by the angelic host and you will hear hymns which have never been sang before. You imagine I'm just sitting there looking one said ain't this something? Can you believe this? Who we going to tell this to? Who in the world are we going to Nobody ever believe this is happening to us? I kind of feel the same way. Sometimes they'll choose that. Who in the world we going to tell this to? We trying to tell them. They look at us and think, "Yeah, right." You know, like he got five heads. What in the world? You people think y'all Yeah, right. Uh-huh. You know what? What you been drinking? Better watch that guy. He's got that blue Kool-Aid. Oh, no. This is kind of purple. You better watch him. He'll be handing that Kool-Aid. I'm the only one that drinks here. &gt;&gt; Okay. We don't hand out this cup. So, if it's going to kill anybody, it's going to kill me. But they look at us and think, "Oh, come on now." You imagine them guys think, "Is this happening?" Right. &gt;&gt; Are are we really invited into the presence of angels? &gt;&gt; Could it be true since it's the very day you took your first breath of life on the earth? God had an angel assigned to you. &gt;&gt; And another one which looks like you before the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Remember when Peter was in jail and wrote and went to the door, they prayed that God would set him free and God set him free and then they didn't believe God answered their prayers. &gt;&gt; Remember that in the book of Acts? &gt;&gt; So poor Roa goes to the door and Peter knocks on the door and I mean she just about has a spell. She goes back to town. Peter's at the door. They said, "You're crazy." &gt;&gt; She's telling them their prayers are answered. Said, "God ain't answering our prayers already. Don't tell us that girl." But you know what they said? &gt;&gt; It is his angel. &gt;&gt; Because they believed each person had an angel that looked like them. &gt;&gt; Yes. So they thought Peter had died and it was his angel. Listen to this. The angels themselves were lights that had showed the word of God. They had the word of God and told them, "Today in the city of David in Bethlehem is born Christ the Savior." The angels had the word and the word came by light to guide. They followed the word of the angels to eternal life. And I say I may I say unto you tonight, we're getting closer to the Christmas time so-called. And we know the scripture says that they come and said we have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship him. But let me update that. &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the west. And we have come to worship him, &gt;&gt; not the star. &gt;&gt; Anybody that says we worship William Brandham is a liar &gt;&gt; and will go to hell &gt;&gt; if they do not repent of such nonsense. &gt;&gt; We pray in the name of the Lord Jesus. We worship the Lord Jesus. You're fixing to see me in a little bit. Baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus. He is our God. But we have seen his star in the west and we come to worship him, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus, not the messenger. [applause] Let me close. You haven't listened to this one in a while. You ought to listen to it. Why it had to be shepherds. Notice God is fixing to make another creation. He's creating mortal earth, mortal life. Angels sing in heaven. But here he's creating a new life, eternal life for man. [laughter] And he's singing to his subjects through angels. Did not the prophet of the Old Testament say, "I will sing unto you." &gt;&gt; Here was God singing to shepherds, through angels. He's singing to his subjects through angels on the earth, not in heaven. Heaven had eternal life. And he's saying, they sang to the heavens. And here the immortal creation is coming in. And now they're singing to earthly people the first time to shepherds. Striking, isn't it? &gt;&gt; He had started a new creation. What was it? A creation of himself. &gt;&gt; God was made flesh and dwelt among us. The Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God, God was created in human form and Jesus Christ his son. God dwelt. He built his tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived in that tabernacle. God, Emmanuel, God with us. He built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that. You know what God is when you see Christ. &gt;&gt; Stand up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] One of these days he'll probably let us look back and see your mother was carrying you in the womb. The doctor said he or she will never live or never survive. There's something going on this is that and the other. You might as well get ready for it. But God had ordained you to be on this earth to express his love. Elelliana sent here tonight when Erica was carrying her and Emma. The doctor gave us all kinds of bad reports. Wasn't sure that Ellie would ever live. the way they were conceived and the way their mama was carrying them. Emma was pulling a lot of the nutrients and things away from Ellie. Wasn't your fault, honey. You wasn't doing it on purpose. But we prayed and we believed and we trusted. No doubt the angel of the god of God come in. How many of you almost had a car wreck? You was heading so and so and something happened in the house and you was delayed five minutes and you got down the road and there was a tractor and trailer and people sprawled all over the road and the angel of God got in your way. &gt;&gt; All of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He sends his angels to prepare the way before us. Hallelujah. Remember this is your identity of who you are. You're more than a carnal man or woman. That's only this part. all night and all day. They watch over you. They care for you. That care doesn't mean they keep you from all trouble. But sometimes that care means they help you through the deepest and darkest trials of life. And in the middle of it, you look at it and think, I'll never be able to get through it. And you are actually talking the truth. But God gives you an angelic visitation. We'll get to it. But I found in setting more on on angels this week that the prophet says that there was actually angels of healing. Angels of healing. And he describes the angel that was sent down to the pool of Saleom. They would go there to the pool and the angel would get down in the water and he would trouble the water. And the word trouble there is bubble. So there's all kind of people laying around it and God would send this maybe the same angel in this certain season. We don't know how often and the first person inside that water would be healed. Aren't you glad we don't have to wait for the seasons to come? Hell &gt;&gt; remember the prophet talking about the two women that come to his meeting &gt;&gt; one of them had a real bad stomach trouble couldn't eat the other one had a tumor both of them was prayed for left off believed God kept having same old symptoms same old symptoms kept confessing the word by a strip some healed &gt;&gt; the one sister got up fixed the breakfast for her kids little oatmeal left over and she just felt She just felt a little something nudge her. Uhhuh. That's what I'm talking about. Eat that oatmeal. She thought if I do, it'll make me sick. It always burn my stomach. But she ate that oatmeal. Give it a little bit of time. Oh, now I It'll probably make me sick again just in a few minutes. It didn't do it. She ate a little more. She had a piece of toast and prophet said she got some eggs and did this and had a gastronomical jubilee. Her sister friend lived right down the road. They live in the same neighborhood. &gt;&gt; She had a tumor. So she went down to tell her sister friend about it. She knocked on the door and she heard that sister screaming and shouting and hollering. She just opened the door and went on in. She said, "What's wrong? What's going on?" She said that tumor fell off &gt;&gt; and she was shaking the sheets looking for it. &gt;&gt; And a man who had dealt with angels since he was a boy said the angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; was just able to pass through their community that morning. And he said, "Now what if they would have give up the night before? &gt;&gt; Then the angel would have went somewhere else." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the angel of God having such a busy schedule? That's a faith church. You understand? For some churches, he's got plenty of time. &gt;&gt; They don't believe in miracles. They don't believe God can do that. We want to be the kind of church that we make our angels work overtime. &gt;&gt; They got to work on Sunday. They got to work on New Year's. They got to work on Christmas. They don't never get a holiday. [laughter] They don't never get a day off because we believe God. [screaming] We believe our God does the same thing that he's already done. He can never change. So the angel of the Lord passed by her house, healed her, passed by the other, and healed her, and kept right on going where going where? from one house to another to another looking for faith people, looking for Rahab people, looking for token people, looking for people that had their faith anointed by the spirit of God. And he had to make a stop. Make a stop. Make a stop. Make a stop. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love him, children? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Let's bow our heads together. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, thank you for allowing us, Lord, to live in this last day. It would have been an awesome time to live in the days of Noah. And if I'd been one of his sons, I'd have packed the pitch. and I like doing woodworking. So, no doubt I'd been in there working this and cutting that and sharpening that and doing something else. If I'd have lived in the days of Enoch, I'd have no doubt I'd been inside the pyramids and doing something else. And if I'd have lived in the days of Nehemiah, I'd been building the stones and reshaping this and that and the other. But you let me live in this day. I'm still a builder. &gt;&gt; I'm doing the best that I know to try to take your word and help build a character in your people. Lord God, those that you've given to my charge to try to help build them into a stature of a perfect man, Lord. And many of these sons and daughters lived in the days of Noah that had got on board the ark. In the days of Nehemiah, they'd been right there helping. In the days of Luther, they'd believe justification. Days of Wesley, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the days of the Pentecostals. Because no matter what age you would have put us, we'd been believers. No question about it. Because that's who we were before the foundation of the world. Lord God, I pray you'd make us more conscious on the level, Father, that were called to walk into it. I'm not made to be able to deal in that realm that your prophet did. There may be men on the earth today that are called and privileged by you to deal in a realm with the angels of God and the supernatural and that sort of thing that I'll never be able to, Lord. But I want all that I can. I want everything that's in my ordained capacity. Oh Jesus, we worship you tonight, Father. We bless your name tonight, Father. Hallelujah. May the angels of God spread their wings over this place tonight and distill drops of salvation, if there's any that's lost. May those distilled drops of purity and holiness fall upon a heart. Lord, if there's any that's sick, may the heal the healing angels pass by this way tonight. Lord, I know there's so many needs among your children anymore. It becomes overwhelming and it may overwhelm me. It may overwhelm Brother Daryl. It may overwhelm us as mortals, but it don't overwhelm them angels if we'll just be patient. they will show up and they're looking for faith. Lord God, we want to live in the right community. I ain't talking about a certain subdivision here in this life in Johnson City. I'm talking about the community of the saints of God, seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. There's many sick among our people, Lord. Different ones fighting different things. Father, I'm asking you that you'll just be mindful of every one of them. Some streaming tonight, no doubt, have different needs in their body. May the angel of God pass by. Those that are sick at home, couldn't be in service. May the angels of God come this way tonight, Father. That one who troubled the water there that day, no doubt he's still troubling the water and troubling the devil, too, cuz he passes by and makes the tumors fall off. Hallelujah. He passes by and cures that stomach trouble. He takes care of the blood pressure. Whether it's high or low, makes him no difference. We're needy tonight, Father. May the angels of the Lord, I know they're here. It's your promise. It's your promise, Lord. Your prophet said there was something sacred about a church. As a matter of fact, he said it was his favorite place to preach. He preferred preaching in churches because he said around them auditoriums there was wicked angels. Wicked angels that hung around them auditoriums. But he said there was something special about a church. And he said it was his favorite place to be in church. Well, Lord, it's ours, too. &gt;&gt; It's ours, too. Oh, sure. You met us at Walmart. Oh, yeah. You You met us at Lowe's. You met me this morning, Lord. I want to thank you for it. You seen that text I got last night, Lord. And I was so troubled about it, and I didn't know how to answer it, Lord. It's just been weighing on me and weighing on me and I didn't know what to say exactly, but you visited me, Lord, and I thank you for it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Help the people to see this is not just a preacher privilege. You want to visit them as they're driving to work. The sisters as they're making beds and fixing breakfast. It ain't just the preachers that are loved. May each one of them be able to see tonight. The same angel could speak to every child of God here in this place and say, "You are highly favored. You have found favor with God. We worship you tonight, Jesus. Oh, bless your name, Father. Sing a little something for us, Harris. We worship the Lord. We have a baptism tonight if they'll come and prepare for that. Brother Daryl, maybe you can come, brother, while they sing. And just give me a little bit of time to prepare. Ain't it been good to be in the house of God? [applause] &gt;&gt; How many of me wants to be more conscious of that world around you? Brother Donnie, I I couldn't stand an angel. I couldn't. Don't worry, friends. &gt;&gt; Mary probably thought the same thing. She had to be told, "Fear not." And for most of us, we'll never have that happen to us. And a lot of your angelic visitations, more than likely, they will be invisible. They will come, they will do their work, and they will pull out of your sphere, and you'll be better, and you'll never see them. But I think I think why God is saying these things to us is that he wants us to know what's around us. But brother Donnie, we're no good and we're we're poor and we're Yeah, I understand why it had to be shepherds. We're not rich. We're [clears throat] not famous. We're not No. But you reckon they let that whole thing interrupt that singing? Oh, I'm not good enough. I'm not good enough. I I I can't I can't listen to this. My ears ain't holy enough. No, my hands ain't holy enough. No. No. But they had to accept what the angel said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he went to that cross, somehow God made me pay for my sins in his body. Then that's what your prophet said. Demonology part two, paragraph 199. And I think of how that when Jesus died, God sent him to hell because of his sins. But he never had any &gt;&gt; of his own. &gt;&gt; But he took yours &gt;&gt; and he took mine. And he took them so completely God judged him guilty of them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The second Adam come to stand in proxy. The first Adam forfeited your eternal life. The second Adam brought it back to you. Don't you love him? Let's just worship it beloved together. Here we are [music] in your presence. [singing] [music] Lifting holy [singing] hands [music] to you. [music] Here [singing] we are [music] praising [singing] Jesus. [music] for [singing] the things [music] he's brought us through. Thank you, Lord Jesus. [music] Well, let's just worship you. Here [singing] we are [music] in [singing] your presence. We love you. Lifting holy [singing] hands to you. [singing] [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here we are praising [music] Jesus. [singing] for the things [music] [singing] he's brought us through. [music] Hallelujah. What a great honor. &gt;&gt; Our little brother has been so troubled about baptism. He said he couldn't wait till Sunday. He did not want to wait. &gt;&gt; I like it when God so gets a hold of somebody's heart, they can't wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what's going on? The angels are still working. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, what a great honor it is for us, Father. How we worship you and thank you. Thank you for dealing with our young children. Lord, we hear news all the time of a sevenyear-old, an 8-year-old, a 10year-old, all different ones shooting people, packing guns, doing all kinds of crazy stuff. The devil is going younger and younger to get his. Why would we want to limit you from doing the same thing? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray you'd deal with my little brother's heart. I can baptize him tonight in water, but only you can take his little soul and fill him with the Holy Ghost. Lord, &gt;&gt; may you be with him, Lord. Keep him by your grace. Father, I pray in the name of Jesus. My little brother, in obedience to his word, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [applause] [applause] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hey, just something about a water baptism, it makes you want to do it again. [laughter] Amen. Aren't you glad to be a part of the economy of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you accept and believe what the angel has said about you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not Luther's day, not Wesley's day, but your day, your time, your season, your hour, your manifestation of the word of God that's spoken concerning you. Amen. Every word of God will be manifested. &gt;&gt; None of his word will return unto him void. And we're a part of that word. Do you believe that this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You can see why the devil tried to sting him with a wasp. Amen. That's some good preaching right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. May the Lord bless our precious brother Donnie and strengthen him and take care of that sting on his finger. We just love him tonight. Let's just sing one more before we go. Can we, brother Harry? Just whatever is on your heart, brother. [music] Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints. Let's just sing this D.

Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful? [music] Let's just bow our heads.

[snorts] And God, we are so grateful, Lord, that we can see [snorts] oursel in your word, Lord.

And oh God, we see, Lord, it's the word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming word in our bodies. Oh God, how we thank you for it, Lord. We thank you for this word of God that we've heard tonight Lord to see God how you have unfolded under our day dear God and we're so grateful in this age of the darkness of Leosa you have turned the light on dear Lord that we see your word that you have unveiled it unto us God with your children now dear God we pray bless them Lord as they work tomorrow and bring them Lord back safely this weekend we ask God for traveling grace as make our way down towards West Tennessee and Arkansas.

Thank you, Father, once again, for all that you've given us for we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. [snorts] And amen. God bless you, saints. You're dismissed. You know, if you're in the Lord, hasn't it been good to be in the house of God? You cause the sun [music] to rise. You lay it down [singing] to rest. You [music and singing] hold this heart of mine.
