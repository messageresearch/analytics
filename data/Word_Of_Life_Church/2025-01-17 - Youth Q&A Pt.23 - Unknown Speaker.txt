everybody's happy serving the lord we will uh pick up on the question that we've been dealing with for a few Services can you explain why brother brandham is a Vindicated Prophet why the message is correct I have a difficult time speaking to why I believe what I believe let's just bow our heads together now and just ask the Lord to help us Lord Jesus we're so grateful as we were just singing this beautiful song Lord we are here to worship you tonight but Lord when we really understand what worship is we know that we don't have to wait to be in church to worship your Prophet has taught us that we can actually worship when we are witnessing about you to others whenever we're doing things in our everyday life it's a worship to God and that's the kind of people that we want to be to where that when we come to church we truly do worship but understanding has been enlightened and broader than what it was many many years ago to know that every day of our life can be a worship Lord Jesus as we assembled here tonight to be able to try to understand more about you and more about your word I pray that you would help me Father help me to get out of the way shut my mouth to anything that would displease you Lord we pray that You' be mindful of of all the sick and the needy tonight Lord pray that you just bless each one that's put forth the effort to be here anoint your word and anoint our hearts I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated if you'd like to read with me we'll turn also to Matthew chapter 26:56 and what we want to do tonight by the help of the Lord is to be able to take um a journey into the New Testament now the last time we dealt with this we was dealing with the the Old Testament and trying to lay it out to help you for those of you that want to broader understanding of why we do believe in a prophet and also to be able to see that it would settle your faith and I know for myself in studying all these as I've looked at all these scriptures so to be able to understand it better I've looked up every scripture that uses the word Seer s ER also the word Prophet singer prophets plural prophesied prophecy so you can imagine it's quite an extensive study but I enjoy doing it because it helps you to be able to understand even more so for me I don't have a question about it but it just broadens my understanding as an individual so if we could we will look tonight at Matthew 26 and start there and then we'll run it on over through the scripture and we'll see how far we get we might get done with this one question tonight because we have a few more yet to deal with notice now in this is Matthew that is writing about the the coming of our Lord Jesus and the prophecies that have been fulfilled in his life and all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled so now this is the beginning of the Christian era you've heard me talk about it and I use the term judeo Christian most of y'all know what that is okay so judeo-christian is actually that our Christianity it is the foundation of it actually goes back to Judaism by which God had called Abraham and then as God called Abraham and the 12 tribes and dealt with them so then Christianity because the first Christians were actually Jews so they believe the Lord and then on the day of Pentecost it began to broaden out of course to receive the Holy Ghost so as Matthew now is writing and remember the Book of Matthew was written several years after these events had transpired so they're looking back in retrospect and they have an understanding and they're saying okay okay now we can see this that he came they didn't have this understanding whenever he was here because the Holy Ghost had not yet been yet given so they were arguing debating who's going to be the greatest whenever you're gone who's going to have the greatest Ministry who's going to be the biggest preacher and so on and they were still trying to identify who he was by the scripture so now after he's done come and they're writing all of this Matthew goes this far and says that all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets so they were actually calling the words and the writings of the prophets of the Old Testament scripture now that's pretty astounding so a prophet is not just another Bible commentator a prophet is not another television preacher he's not just a local Pastor in a church he's not just a local man that goes out and preaches on the street or something like that a prophet is totally different now I write down things too but what I write down are not scriptures every preacher in the message brother Joe writes down notes but they're not scriptures so you think now that Matthew on this side of the Cross after receiving the Holy Ghost began to look and see what what is termed as the Canon of the Bible the scriptures and that what the prophets were saying were actually scriptures now it says all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled but you know when I read this Bible verse it makes me wonder how many people in the days of Ezekiel Jeremiah Malachi Hagi all the different prophets Zachariah uh the the Psalms of David whenever they begin to write these things and whenever they were living in that day did the people of that day take that as scripture or did they just take it as well you know Jeremiah he's so strange anyway I mean he come in into the king's court and he has this yoke upon his neck and it would have been a yoke that would have been very heavy very crude and he had his his hands up inside that yoke and he said thus sayeth the Lord you're going down to Babylon and then people looked at him and said are you crazy are you out of your mind we're the chosen people of God you're nuts man they let him down into a pit and he sunk up to his waist in the mud they had to drop his water and his food down to him they ridiculed him they laughed at him there's no way the majority of the people believe that these prophets words were scriptures what about Hagi 2:7 whenever Hagi said that the desire of all the nations shall come what about whenever Isa Isaiah said Isaiah 7:14 a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child Isaiah 35:3 the lame shall leap as in heart the tongue of the dumb shall sing all these prophets as they said these things but no doubt the people in their day there was very few of them that even believe what they had to say to be able to make them scriptures now I say that parallel about them so that we are precautious in the day we live in so you see after the prophet of God of our age has come and gone the sad part about it is we see many people that have been around the message and in time what do they do they begin to sort through his message and categorize what they feel like is inspired so this part was of God this part wasn't this part was was this part wasn't and then you think is that exactly what they done when these men were on the earth there's no way the majority of the people even in Israel beli Jeremiah was a prophet of God there's no way they believed Ezekiel all the rest of these men were they would have not give them the hard time and they were constantly rebuking them for their sins and then what did Satan do had false prophets that would come say oh it ain't that bad why you're the people of God yeah you're going down to Babylon but you're just going to be there two years but Jeremiah was the hard prophet he was the difficult one Jeremiah said 70 but the false prophet said to and he knows how many years they were there 70 why Jeremiah was the true prophet of God but did they believe what he was saying was the scripture they did not now here we are confronted with the same thing and it makes it so difficult for us to be able to try to understand it now watch but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled Mark 1 verse 2 as it is written in the prophets behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee now here Mark is quoting from Isaiah 40 but he's also quoting from Malachi 3 this is why it gives it the plurality whenever he said the prophets but in the days of Isaiah what did they do to him laughed at him ridiculed him anybody know how he died they put him in a hollow log and sought him in two him screaming and crying for Mercy would they have ever believed that man was writing the holy scriptures no way no way they thought oh them them people's crazy why them prophets say all kinds of things and the sad part about it is it was not the Babylonians the Persians the cians many of the heathens it was Jews the people they were sent to I pray God helps us that we never do that to our Prophet as it is written in the prophets behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee Luke 1: 69 now what I want you to understand tonight as we go through this how common that the term prophet and prophets was to the New Testament Christians and Believers and how strange it is to most Christians today and yet we are looked at because people hear that we follow a prophet I had one of my nieces to text me the other day and she said Uncle Donnie I cannot believe that I have been deprived from being able to text you and being able to have communication with you for all of these years now she's been estranged from me for many many years because another one of my family members told her that I worshiped brother brandom and that I really didn't preach but all I done was got up and reread brother brandom's sermons and she said I am so sorry that I believe that against you so I text her back and I said well I said we worship only one person in our church and his name is not William bradam it's the Lord Jesus Christ it is him who died for us it was him who raised from the dead I said but we do believe that God sent a prophet and his name was William brandham so she text me back in a few minutes and she said yeah I know that she said because I text Alicia and I asked her about it and Alicia told me the whole truth she said but why would this family member poison me against you why would they want to do that I said well I'm not sure but God will make them answer for it and I said I forgave them years and years ago of such a thing now why would it then that we would be so odd and so peculiar here it's like we read from another Bible but actually we're reading from the same Bible they read from but you know why it sticks out to you you know why it sticks out to me when I read it it's because as brother Homer preached about it last night we have the tutorship of the shepherd himself you see the same Lord Jesus that anointed these men and they wrote about the prophets is the same Lord Jesus that's opened our hearts to help us to see it's not odd and peculiar when I read my Bible I think it's so odd that theologians have studied the Bible for decades of their life and they are totally ignorant of God sent a prophet in the last day and you think how sad and here I am I know I'm ignorant I know I'm a dummy I didn't even complete High School H are you kidding me Carol told me yesterday she said you know God is so blessed she said you've been all over the world you've traveled to so many continents you've been here and done that she said what somebody ever told you that what would you believed I'd lie said I'd laughed at them me a little Old Kentucky hillbilly I didn't think I'd ever get out of the hills much less go around the world you got to be kidding me but it's amazing what God has in his mind for us don't you ever Bel what God may do for you now watch in Luke 1: 69 he has raised up an Horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David as he spake by the mouth now would you notice how Luke writes this he does not say mouths as in plural but Mouth singular he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets but when it comes to prophets he makes it plural but only one Mouse wow so I wonder whose mouse that was was it Moses Mouse and Jeremiah used Moses Mouse and Ezekiel used Moses mouth uh-uh it's only one Mouse you understand when brother Homer was up here last night speaking by the spirit of God you know whose mouse that was the Lord used brother Homer's big mouth he did he used that but what did you hear whenever you heard it I heard the Lord using a human being ain't that right so a true anointed servant of God they're still speaking by the mouths of the Lord this is why the prophet tell us in the church age book the final voice to the final age will be in the bride of Christ is that right so it's just one mouth every true anointed servant of God is speaking by the mouths of the Lord I I love the way that the authors would pin this as he spake by the mouths of the Holy prophets which have been since the world began wow you mean so here is Luke this is written around 50 60 AD something like that and Luke makes this reference that the prophets were all the way back since the world began so why is it that people find it so strange that God would still use one in this day let me tell you why Creeds and dogmas and traditions have kept them away from it look in verse 71 that he would sa be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all of them that hate us Luke again chapter 18:31 then he took unto him the 12 and he said unto him behold we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished so here's the Lord Jesus and he setting an example now to the preachers that's going to preach now these these preachers have never preached before at all the priest never preached in the Old Testament so the these preachers need an example and Jesus has given them an example on how to preach the gospel you know the example that he gives them he wants them to make reference back to what the prophet said so I think about it the first books that were written in the New Testament were written around 55 a so the Holy Ghost came and around 33 to 34 ad so what did they preach from 34 ad to 59 ad what books did they read from oh brother Donnie the New Testament no there was no new testament so what did they quote the Old Testament prophets and the words that Jesus said and then the started quoting Peter James Bartholomew Thaddius Paul those oh my goodness you mean that they was quoting men you know I I just get I just I can't keep from laughing sometimes because people that'll come and we've had so many visitors that have come uh since we've been in this new place and I'll watch them when I go to you know whenever I go to preaching and you you can tell by looking at them when they're dressed and they're just visitors they ain't never heard nothing like this in their life there's a couple sit right here not long ago man and a woman and I watched them as I was playing the guitar and they was clapping their hands and you know swaying and all that stuff and I knew they didn't belong here and I thought well we'll see how long they last whenever I go to preaching so they was really into the singing really into the worship and all that and then whenever I started preaching I'm not going to alter what the Lord's put on my heart I'm going to preach what the Lord's given me so they sat turn there look back and forth back and forth at one another they sat there maybe 15 20 minutes and they was gone they was out of here poor things there's no tell what they thought but you can imagine as as the first quote goes up on the screen and I thinking who is that man what what oh don't tell me but yet many of the Baptist Methodist Church of God Luther they'll refer back to Luther they'll refer back to George Whitfield they'll refer back to John Wesley Charles Wesley they'll even quote Charles Stanley they will quote you know James Dobson they'll quote this man that man that man and I'll say oh my goodness so why is it they look at us and think we are so weird when their own preachers do the same thing but one major difference is we're quoting from a Vindicated prophet and they are quoting from a theologian and some of those men had some very good things to say but aren't you glad we're sitting under a prophetic Ministry now watch again in Luke 24:25 the Lord Jesus after he raises from the dead then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe oh my goodness all the prophets have spoken now remember before he dies he refers them to the prophets after he raised from the dead he still refers them to the prophets in verse 27 and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them and all oh my goodness oh no no no no no no you mean to tell me Jesus believed what what the prophet said were scriptures wow I don't feel so weird I feel right at home I feel right at home you know what that makes me believe I am I'm a Jesus man I'm a Jesus follower I'm preaching the way Jesus did cuz Jesus quoted the prophets praise the Lord sir don't let people out here intimidate you all don't let them oh they're ignorant sure but don't let them intimidate you because you go to this skirt church we don't deny that even our piano wears a skirt brother they want to ridicule us laugh at us let them do it we don't care they call us odd and peculiar because we quote the prophets we we preach like Jesus that's what he done that's what the apostles done now you imagine when Paul begin to write and Paul told them when they received that certain letter and he said now you all read this letter and then you also read the letter from leosia which we don't even have that letter so it must have got lost somewhere down through time so you know what they were doing they were quoting from Ezekiel Jeremiah Hagi Malachi Zachariah Moses all that and then whenever the prophet Paul was there he would write them letters and they'd start sharing them letters so it would be like that our church would get a letter and then would say oh my goodness that is so good and then we'd want to share it with the church over in Irwin and and share it with you know brother Bill and these other churches around here and they would say oh somebody told me that brother R Spencer's Church they got another letter from from the church at IPI and would say brother Malachi the next time y'all go up there to visit your family see if they'll let you B borrow that letter and what we'll do we'll send you the letter we got from you know from cesaria and then all the preachers brother Ron say oh Church oh we got something exciting brother Malachi is coming up to visit in a few days and he's going to be bringing a letter that Paul wrote how blessed we are when you have access to the message of the hour right on your phone do you realize how blessed we are to live in this age we are the only age that had the ability to hear the literal voice of our messenger those that didn't live in the days when Paul was alive all they had left was written words in the days of all the rest of those Church aged Messengers but God has made a way where we can hear that voice I am so grateful I've been hearing it today I heard it for hours yesterday and the day before and the day before been listening to it again today over and over again I love it myself we are so blessed notice in Jesus again beginning at Moses and all the prophets expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things con concerning himself now you imagine after those words have now been fulfilled the Lord Jesus now the setting is on the way to emus so the disciples are going along they're so tore up they thought oh that they thought Jesus was the one but then he he was crucified and died and and they're they're just going around they're so sad and they're just so tore up and Jesus joins himself to him and said where y'all going and he said oh we we just we we've been we've been talking about these things he said these things that's happened and Jesus said what things what things so they said Jesus the son of God and we thought we we thought look at them now they're not even sure aren't you glad Jesus don't get mad at us when we have questions and things that we don't understand well Michael there they're just been honest and open we thought it was him but now we're kind of having doubts about it we're just we're just not sure so Jesus didn't get mad and said you bunch of serpent eat you you go back down there and get saved when you get saved then I'll talk to you but he wanted to help he saw they had questions and Jesus didn't take about a 15 minute sermon it as a matter of fact the prophet tells us it was actually several hours on that way a six-hour sermon on Prophecy don't worry I ain't preaching that long I've got my timer set on my iPad and I'm watching it close but can you imagine a 6-hour sermon on Pro prophecy and may went back to the ti of Abel and the lamb and the Redemption money at the Tabernacle and here they are walking along the way and once again Jesus given the example to cleopas and his friend and they come to an end and it was getting late and Jesus acted like he was going to go on you know this Friday ens me a little bit because I think I wonder how many times that Jesus may act like he's going to just kind of bypass our service well it's just a youth service there ain't that many of us but I want to be one of them that I'll stop him don't you so they said would you come in and and break bread with us the time is far spent and it's evening time they still didn't know who he was so they go in and sit down and they order some bread maybe some drink of some sort and Jesus Takes the bread and he begins to break it and when he broke the bread their eyes were open and they knew who he was and he vanished out of their side what do you say we're here we've come by this end tonight so if Jesus acts like that he's going to go right on by what do you say that we say Jesus would you care to stop here with us tonight we've got needs we've got desires we we' got needs in our bodies needs in our understanding would you stop and stay with us for a a little while Jesus I believe you will don't you what a setting Luke 24: 44 and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you but all things might be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning in me what's he wanting them to see that he had a scriptural background and a scriptural identification this will give them fa now this is the foundation of the Gospel now remember these men are going to first start preaching to Jews why does he keep going back to the scripture he wants them to come out of there and be able to introduce their Jewish Brothers with a scriptural Foundation a mosaic Foundation a prophetic Foundation that they can point back and say Brothers this is what Jeremiah said this is what Zachariah said when he said the man whose name is the Branch b r a an CH the man that David was speaking about when God told him of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne this is the man oh Oh you mean Oh you mean that this Jesus he he wasn't a renegade no that this was the very one that Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me from among his Brethren and everyone that will not hear that Prophet will be cut off from among the people what do he want them to have a foundation what do I want to leave for you young people I want you to understand that we are not following a cult we are not part of something that is not scriptural we are part of something that starts Plum back from the foundation of the world and goes all the way to the Book of Revelation now notice which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me John 6:45 now here another writer of the New Testament it is written in the prophets they shall all be taught of God every man therefore that has heard and has learned of the father cometh unto me now John is is quoting Jesus in the book of Acts chap 3: 18 but those things which God before had showed by the mouth singular of all the prophets plural that Christ should suffer he has so fulfilled now watch so here we've got the apostles preaching look at the way they're preaching they're preaching after the manner that the Lord Jesus gave them so these apostles then they're not standing up and preaching and they take the first 30 minutes talking about themsel well I'll tell you one thing I've been fighting that Old Devil I don't know what in the world's going on I'm so persecuted I'm run down I'll tell one thing me me I I me me I no that's not what they preached they preached Jesus they preached in the same mannerism that mannerism was give it a scriptural Foundation now remember Jesus knew this gospel was going to go around and around the world these men are learning from the best preacher that ever lived so watch how they preached just like him and they took it right back to the scripture now notice by the mouth of all the prophets that Christ should suffer has he so fulfilled Revelation 3:21 or acts 3:21 rather whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of the restitution of all things now watch prophetically they know there's coming a time when all things will be restored you mean to tell me the Lord Jesus has come to the earth now been resurrected the Holy Ghost has come back on the day of Pentecost lost but they're talking about a time of restitution well when's that going to be you mean it wasn't then well according to them it wasn't whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken look at the apostolic Foundation how they believed prophets spoke which God hath spoken by the mouth I'm sure you're seeing this pattern over and over again by the mouth of the Holy prophets plural since the world began verse 24 yay and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after and as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days acts 10:42 he commanded us to preach unto the people unto testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead so what are they doing they're preaching exactly the way Jesus told them to preach boys don't get up there and tell how many years you spent in school don't get up there and talk about yourself don't get up Turn Point the people to you but tell them about me praise the Lord ever God call man that's his great desire right now I could talk to you about me I've had several people ask me and my life of being a preacher why haven't you never given a life story my answer is always the same there ain't that much to say it wouldn't take me very long to say it I could say it in a few minutes that'd be the end of it why would I want to spend my time talking about me when I can tell you about the resurrection and the life and the Healer and the deliverer which would you rather hear about a man full of mistakes and error or a man that is almighty God himself the Lord Jesus I don't know about you sure I like hearing stories about this and that but don't waste my time trying to magnify some man somewhere some preacher somewhere tell me about the resurrection and the life you'll not find it being Apostolic Doctrine to take all of our time talking about one another Well Amen brother Donnie preach it brother Donnie I'm with you amen now notice to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins now watch this in Acts 11: 27 and in these days came now wait a minute I thought the Bible said the law and the prophets were un John and then from that time the Kingdom of Heaven is preached and every man presseth his way into it now the Bible does actually say that but that scripture has been used to try to prove prove that we don't need prophets but was that what the apostles believed no CU now here they are living years after the law and the prophets supposedly done been fulfilled but yet this is the way the Apostolic Church what they had in their church and in these days came prophets oh my goodness more than one prophets from Jerusalem onto Antioch and the use of Word of Life Church said amen acts 131 now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius of sirene and Mahine and which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch and Saul so you mean in the Apostolic Church there was prophets wow well I wonder what they done what did these prophets do were they different than Apostles apparently were they different than pastors they were were they different than Mark Mark was an evangelist were they different from him yes look in Acts 13:27 for they that dwell at Jerusalem and the rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets so now you imagine we're not actually living in 2025 we're going to go back in time and we're in the first century we're in the first century so I would be standing up in a cave and a catacomb and a little small building and I would be preaching to the Youth of the first century what would I be quoting I would be quoting about Moses and Jeremiah and Ezekiel but because I've got the Holy Ghost I will all also be updated and I'll be quoting from Paul and I will be acknowledging in the church that there is a man by the name of agabus and agabus is not a prophet like a church AED messenger but he is a man that stands up and prophesies and what he says comes to pass y'all remember reading about agabus in the New Testament some of you do some of you don't all right so Paul comes up to this certain City where agabus is so agabus gets Paul's garment and he takes it over and he binds Paul up with it takes it to Paul and he says now he had never met Paul he didn't know him physically so whoever owns this garment this man is going to Jerusalem and he's going to be bound so he didn't say something that nobody understood he didn't say something that could be taken either way but it was very descriptive and it was very definite that's a true Prophet now watch this in verse 32 of chapter 15 and Judas and Silas now this is not Judas is scariot but another Judas and Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the Brethren with many words and confirm them wow so now here we are in Acts chapter 15 this is years after John the Baptist is done gone and yet the Apostolic Church believed in New Testament prophets praise the Lord acts 24:14 but this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the god of my fathers Paul here speaking believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets so you see if we were New Testament Christians and you were the use of the New Testament Church to believe in prophet phets would be so commonplace to you because every time the preachers would get up to preach they'd say the prophet Moses said the Prophet Jeremiah said the prophet Zachariah said the prophet Hagi said the prophet Malachi said and then they'd say and God sent his beloved brother Paul a prophet of God with the word of this age and Paul wrote to the Corinthian Church that they are not to speak in tongues just out open in the church that they if there's no interpreter let them hold their peace oh my goodness you mean you all are quoting what Paul said yes we are and the Beloved brother Paul said that women are to remain silent in the church and the Beloved brother Paul now wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I'm going to check out Paul by the Old Testament and I want somebody to show me in the Old Testament where the Old Testament Prophet said a woman had to remain silent in the church I'm going to check Paul tonight with the scriptures well if you're going to make that approach let me just tell you in advance what you're going to do you're going to make a fool out of yourself cuz the Old Testament never said that but I want you to notice what Paul did 1 Corinthians 14:34 so let your women keep silence in the churches as also sath the law now if you find me where the law says it I'll eat this Pulpit it'll take me a while but I'll eat it but I feel safe because I've done looked it don't say it oh my goodness so what was Paul quoting he was quoting The Silence of the law you ever wonder if women can be pastors why there are no requirements for a woman Pastor now there are for men so let the man that desires the office of a bishop he desires a good thing and he has to be the husband of one wife so because the scripture gives no scriptural identification so a woman who desireth to be a pastoret or whatever her pronoun is to be a woman Pastor so she must be the wife of one husband she cannot be a polygamist because the scripture gives no requirement for a woman preacher 1 Corinthians 14:34 or 1 Timothy 2:12 would not even have to be written because there is no identification to describe her office so Paul said there is no scripture in the Old Testament where it said let the Priestess it was Idol worshippers who had priestesses not children of God so Paul quoted The Silence of the law and use that as a reference that no doubt that there were people in that day that said Paul said wow Paul where did you get that at there's some things that Paul wrote in the New Testament not another one of the writers said I thought the Bible said let every word be proven by two or three Witnesses oh my goodness why are y'all so quiet on me tonight cat got your tongue even brother Joe was quiet so I guess my question is for some of the preachers in the message that think they are so much smarter than our prophet and if they don't go along with certain things that he preached they say well I don't see that in the scripture I'm going to give brother brandom a word test and if I can't find it in the scripture then I ain't going to believe it you're making an idiot out of yourself I don't care if you've preached 138 years you're exalting yourself above a Vindicated Prophet what if God gave him that and it is a word from God and then we will exalt our own intelligence above a word from God you see what we would do exactly what they did in the days of Jeremiah Ezekiel hagga zakari if it comes right down to it but and it's even opinion this is where your pastor stands so nobody would have to worry about it even if it's opinion I'll take brother brandom's opinion over my own sir or over any other preacher as far as that goes because you know what I've never been privileged to walk with God the way he did nor has any other man in this age John saw Seven Stars in the right hand of Jesus not 37 47 397 but seven so those men had a special place with God I will never have that neither will any other man now there's a lot of men that feel like they are there but I'm sorry well no really I'm not John did not see an eighth star a ninth star a 10th star star a 47th star you only saw seven now think are we Apostolic if we leave out prophets from our church are we Apostolic if we leave out God sending a prophet with a message we're not Apostolic because they believed in prophets can I go on a few more minutes can I go on a few more minutes okay brother Homer said y'all was the noest bunch of people ever seen in his life now watch in Acts 28:23 and when they had appointed him a day there came many to him in his lodging to whom he expounded this is Paul testified the kingdom of God persuading them concerning Jesus both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets listen how long he did it from morning till evening wow that must have been a hungry bunch of people you see why they were following the example of the Lord Jesus to include the prophet Romans 16:25 now to him that is of power to establish you according no way no way this man is going to say these words establish you according to my gospel you mean Paul is going to assert this in the Bible and call this his gospel I have no problem in saying Amen to that you now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which have was Kept Secret since before the world began but is now made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets young people is it not amazing how many times that your Bible identifies the words of the prophets as scriptures you might wonder why that a preacher would get so nervous and as you know I've been preaching since I was 18 years old and I'm 68 so this is my 50th year in March would be 42 years maybe something like that since I've been in the message if you could have a little camera inside the steud there and while Brother Lou is leading the singing specials are going on or before service starts and I'm back there by myself and I'm walking the floor and I'm praying oh Jesus please help me Lord please help me I don't say nothing wrong please help me God and people say brother Donnie you you still get nervous and I say you ought to see me I said really after all these years I mean why would you get nervous because I realize I'm going to have to stand before God I'll have to stand before God for this service tonight and if I mislead one person if I would take scriptures or quotes and put them together or if in my studies I would find several quotes and they actually say opposite from what I'm trying to project and I just kind of leave them out because in reality that would give you a different thought but because it don't go along with my thought then I'll said well I'll just you know I just kind of leave that out that really it's not that's not my thought now I study weird okay I study weird God gives me a thought by inspiration of the spirit of God I might be driving down a road I might be listening to a tape um I might wake up 3:00 in the morning whatever he he gives he deals with me in different ways and then I will take that thought and start looking and building now once I start building I I've got a file and I I looked at that window well I've got I've got four Microsoft Word windows open at one time and I I looked at that one window that I studying from today and I'm on page 519 on the other window joining to it it's called 500 and something that's only part of it it's probably one that been about a th pages and that's of notes and things that I've made accumulation of years so whenever I'm there I look at it and then I see it building building then what I do is I look at it and I try to tear that thought apart you said why would you do that because if me a knucklehead can tear it apart the devil sure can if it's really God it'll stand the test and I've had things come to me that I thought were inspiration and I would think oh my goodness and it would so alarm me and excite me I said oh my goodness I can't believe I've never seen that before and I I'm sending myself emails all the time Time by by scriptures and quotes and things like that so I might send it to myself and then later when I got my laptop my lap said oh man I'm so excited and I go to pulling it up I thought wow and I said yeah I remember this and I remember that but all of a sudden I go to feeling so funny and I think Lord what's wrong something ain't right something ain't right and then this word will come to me and that word and that word and I go to pulling up this and that and I break out in a cold sweat brother Malachi I've sat in my chair and had to take my hand and rub my brow because I was fixing to build a subject on something that was only part truth and the more I studied it but the Jo I sat there and become a nervous wreck and I've actually set my laptop down before and just get up and walk around a little bit cuz I it just tore me all to pieces where did that come from let me tell you demons demons you see preachers are very vulnerable man he can get things that'll seem so real and it'll be so close to the truth but remember if it is the spirit of God it won't just take this quote and that one and that one it should be able to line up through the whole message before I ever saw the Oneness of the godhead Carol had an uncle and he was a great man really loved the Lord but he was Jesus only y'all know what Jesus only is most of you don't well Jesus only believes that Jesus was his own father and that many of them baptize single name you know what that is no okay they baptize in the name of Jesus only and Carol's Uncle every time I was still a trinitarian and every time he'd get around me boy he'd go to try to talk me to talk to me and convert to me and I'd always go back to where Matthew 28:19 and I said buddy no matter what what you say Jesus is the one that said that but her uncle bless his heart he would never be able to take Matthew 28:19 and tie it together with acts 238 and it's like it would stump him and he didn't have the answer but you know who God used to help me see it a man man who could take both Matthew 28:19 and acts 238 instead of setting them against one another made them blend together and when a man did that it open my eyes just like that I like hearing a man that can do that now these were the men of God and how they took the scriptures and they didn't have to just oh no no no no don't worry about the Old Testament no no don't don't don't worry about that we're we're in another day now we're in another day you don't need that that was not the way they were taught to preach the word so any idea I have or any other preacher that does not come back to the message of the hour you better run from it I don't care how good it feels I don't care how many people might say oh that's it that's it if it's the word of the Lord it'll come right back into the scripture and into the message of the hour let me close you momentarily Ephesians chapter 2: 19 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built now this is the way the Apostolic Church taught their people you are built upon the foundation of the apost Apostles now wait a minute I thought Jesus was the foundation now remember what God is doing God is building a mystical spiritual body this is why we needed a prophit to take us back to our foundation which was the apostles now what is the foundations of the city in the Eighth Day what the names going to be on the foundations there those foundations building up of the city of the New Jerusalem what is it those foundations the apostolic foundations so the new testament's based upon it the city itself so the true bride are going to be Apostolic Believers not Apostolic organization but right here and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and say it with me prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone so Paul takes that the foundation is the apostles and the prophets and the Chief Cornerstone anybody know what this is you know it's kind of different from our terminology of building but a lot of their buildings are made out of a stone so the Chief Cornerstone was a two-sided Stone like this so they would lay that first Cornerstone now watch Paul is doing a great mystery here in a symbol because he knows so you imagine how this must have seemed to the people of that day that Paul was actually saying Jesus laid him s on top of the Apostles and the prophet's teachings he's going to build his body so here is a two-sided Stone now watch Paul's mirror that he's looking at so one side will be Jews the other side will be Gentiles so here's the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets and Jesus said I'm laying myself right on top of that Foundation and I'll start it out with Jews and Gentiles and then there'll be more cornerstones more cornerstones build up build up build up praise God Ephesians 3:5 which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets look how these people in the New Testament preached about prophets can I have just a couple more minutes and we'll be able to finish this part tonight Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers fivefold Ministry now remember brother brandham brother brandham is not this class of prophet this is a prophet in the church he was a church AG messenger Silas that we read about in The Book of a acts agabus he was not a church age messenger Hebrews 1 1 God who innd our times and diverse manners spake in time passed unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son wow so how did he speak to us by his son by Ephesians 4:11 his son well you say brother Donnie where's the Lord Jesus he's right here tonight he was here last night he was in Louisiana last night in Virginia all different parts of the world the Son of God still here anointing his ministry you see this ministry of Ephesians 4:11 it's not really my Ministry it's not really about Joe's Ministry these brothers that we love and appreciate so much around the world it's actually Jesus ministry himself let's stand together we'll read our last scripture here Revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery the mystery of God should be finished notice how John terms this that he doesn't say mysteries of God but it's the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so this is why we believe according to the New Testament prophecies as Jesus said in Matthew Elias truly shall first come and restore all things and we believe why do we believe this is brother Brandon you can do as I did if you so wish whenever someone started talking to me about Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 Matthew 17 Matthew 11 and started telling me well that Prophet was brother randam I didn't just swallow it them he showed me the scriptures and I thought well you know what that's the Bible you know what I did I got dictionaries I got encyclopedias I went to a local library and I started ping up religious literature I thought well Jesus said there's going to be a prophet Malachi said this going to be so I started studying about the main leaders in that in this day which we lived to see who it was Oral Roberts John G Lake I went from one to the other to the other AA Allen this one that one the other one when I got done looking at all of that I thought the answer is simple the answer is simple there was only one man that could fit that pattern and really be a true prophet of God now I'm not belittling any of those men Whitmore some great men that did great things for God but that's not the same thing as being a church- aged messenger many of them were trinitarians AA Allen was a man of great Miracles Jack Co great Miracles great Supernatural trinitarians AA Allen Assembly of God many of those men of that day they didn't have the correct water baptism how could they restore us back to Apostolic fathers when Peter and them baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so there had to be a man that would turn our hearts back or Roberts left the university a Allen went out to Arizona bought up Miracle Mile still named after him today after that Community there all of that that they did this man built this this man built that they've got roads named after him Billy Graham Highway Billy Graham bridge this that the other and what did Brother brandham leave any of our youth ever been to the brandham university you know why there isn't one so is there a four lane named after him maybe a bridge maybe a highway somewhere no as a matter of fact he went to Oral Roberts and he walked into his place and saw all the marble and saw all the letters being automated not even hand touched a human hand never even touched him opened up by automation receiving thousands of letters of wheat brother brandham walked out of there and felt kind of sad he said or's Ministry come off of mine TL osbor and he said Lord I I'd hate for them guys to see what I've got one typewriter sitting in the end of a little trailer and that was his office office he said Lord I guess you couldn't trust me with very much but a voice spoke to him and said Hallelujah but I am your portion give me that we've got a nice place the Lord's blessed us oh you but give me Jesus give me Jesus over a big name I've never had a big name don't want one never ask God for it my heart's desire is not that people will think I'm great in something you know that I my name would be a a common name among people but if I could be able to help people get saved if I could preach something that would set them free if I could talk a young person out of committing suicide if I could help a sister that struggling with makeup or something and and study and bring something that would help deliver that's my desire if I have to go by the way of the grave and my body is laid here in a casket and the brothers come and say whatever they can say about me let it not be said oh he was a great man he done this and that and the other no ain't what I want but let different people testify I was lost and God used him to lead me to Christ I was sick and God used him to bring healing but he didn't point us to himself he pointed us to the Lord Jesus no greater thing could be said about me than that what do you want people to say about you oh my don't you love him let's just bow our heads together Lord Jesus as we have our heads bowed together father we thank you for this little journey that we've taken tonight in the scriptures I Marvel Lord as I look at all of them and there's even more that I could have brought but I I think they got it Lord we're so grateful that you've opened our understanding and helped us to see in the scriptures why we believe you have sent a prophet in this day Lord God we are so grateful because we look around at the churches that are founded on this man and that man and this person and that person and I sat the other day talking to a man in a place of business he said what what what do you do I said I'm a I'm a pastor oh where at so we started talking a little bit and he said well I I used to go to church but over at this certain Church you heard of it I said no I don't think so he said well we went there but the pastor had one girlfriend in the church and another girlfriend and my wife committed adultery on me and he said you know now that I think about it it makes me wonder if she wasn't having an affair with him I said sir I am so sorry I'm so sorry I said I hope you know that every preacher don't do that he said oh I know they don't but I sat down and I heard the hurt in that man's voice the tears running out of his eyes I thought what is going to be for men who claim to be preachers that live a life of such God we thank you for the message of the hour keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true keep me faithful Lord help me that my life will always be worthy of the Gospel help these young people father that we won't just talk about a prophet but we'll be able to live this message that the prophet brought I don't think it was just mere chance that just a few months after he preaches the seals and the breach and God in Simplicity that he preaches a sermon called is your life worthy of the Gospel May Our Lives be worthy of this message Lord may we never get our eyes on this great preacher that great church this great work but may we always keep the same terminology that your Prophet had there's only one great one among us and that's Jesus all of us whenever we stand before you that day we'll bow our heads and we'll say that we don't even deserve a reward I don't think about a reward what little bit I've been able to do for you and your people I don't do it with a reward in mind when I get there that day if you say to all my brothers you all done this and that and the other and I woke up before you and I done my best but it'll be nothing compared to the Great Men but Lord Jesus there's some words I want to hear well done my good and faithful servant I'll be standing there and watch the Great Men of this day you'll reward them for their great sermons The Great prayer lines they had and all the things they done or it might take quite some time for each one of them as they get the reward and I want to be standing there I I tell my brothers that different ones of them I want to be standing near when you stand before [Music] him it may not take but just a few minutes for mine to be said but Lord if I can hear those words well done my good and faithful servant that will mean everything to me I'll be able to take my wife by her hand both of us knew in a glorified body and walk into the paradise of God it'll be worth all the hours that I've spent all the death threats that I've got all the ridicule that I've got even sometime from my brothers when even some of my own Brothers will call my name from their pulpits and blasphemy and whatever it'll be worth it Lord Lord Jesus maybe some of these young people have been misunderstood and they've been ridiculed and laughed at by friends family members maybe even people that go to church with but help them to realize we're not striving to please each other but you Lord I'm not looking to please the world if I please the world it's evident I'm I cannot please the world and please you oh Jesus we love you tonight we worship you father we bless your name God bless you young people I love you with all my heart brother Michael certainly enjoyed that tonight really the thing that I love the most about it is he didn't use a single quote from brother Brandon to prove that he was a prophet and to prove why we believe what we beli he just used scripture the whole time we can identify everything that we've heard and we've learned in the Bible it's not some man's opinion it's the voice behind the voice that is teaching us and guiding Us in these things and I'd like to ask brother Donnie to help sing with this one ever if he wants to is toally up to him that
