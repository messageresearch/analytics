would let's let's turn to the scripture Matthew chapter 19 verse 16 Lord would help me today I like to speak to you on circumstance and we're going to look at it different couple different scriptures and we just trust the Lord like we always do we don't so Matthew 19:16 let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we certainly Love You Lord we we thank you Lord Jesus for your presence Lord we thank you Lord Jesus that you care so much about us Lord that you hush the angels to hear us worship thank you Lord Jesus there's times in our lives where we feel so insignificant but Lord a great big God sace before the foundation of the world Lord that don't make us great but it certainly does make you great so Lord we're coming today Father looking for more of a revelation of that great God and Lord Jesus you see these mortal lips Lord I I certainly Within Myself wouldn't be able to say anything to encourage them Lord but I count on you father once again and I know these people are counting on you as well Lord to get me out of the way to get themselves out of the way father may you have your way in this service today Father I'm not bound by notes father just help me to be sensitive your Holy Spirit and move according to your will and your purpose Lord our greatest desire fathers to get closer to you to know you better and today you've given us that opportunity just help us to submit to you father we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen amen Matthew 19 16 starting with verse 16 says and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good things shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if that will enter into a life keep Commandments there's the Baseline right that's where we got to start we got to keep the Commandments that's the Baseline I don't know it's whistling he said unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear F false witness honor thy father and thy mother Thou shalt love thy neighbor as theirself and the young man said unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet may the Lord add His blessings to the word may you be seated I'm going lose this quick maybe so we're looking at the Rich Young Ruler and I know this is very familiar but so here's a young man that comes up and we know that we've been taught that that he was raised in quote unquote the message he was taught the truth he kept the command Commandments he knew the the Baseline right you know he he knew all these things and yet he knew there was something missing right he said what lack I how do I gain eternal life I've kept all the Commandments but there's a hole there's something missing there's something that's not right there H sounds like a bunch of message keid kids grew up in the message know quotes know the Bible know how to live they've sat on these pews and heard sermon after sermon and not just a sermon there's a lot of people that hear sermon but they heard the anointed word the truth of the hour we've got one of the finest uh uh pastors if not the finest he is in my opinion that that stands behind this pulpit and we hear these things over and over again and it's not some dead letter it's something living yes we're seeing something take place we're seeing all these things and and the Miracles are being performed we see healings we see all these things happening right before us and we're we're educated and we know that but yet there's some out there that know the Baseline but they know that there's something lacking they know that there's a void somewhere where am I Lord I I I love you and I believe they love how could you not love a God that we serve how could you not love a God that we see perform Miracle after Miracle see how he's working in our lives how could you not love him yes sir yeah but what lackest thy now here comes the hard Choice here comes the thing that that he loved the most M come on Jesus approaches him with the thing that he loved the most Jesus said unto him if thou Wilt be perfect go and sell all that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me so this young man was at a cross Cross Roads yeah he could go on living a good life I know a lot of people that live good lives I know a lot of of of of message kids that grew up in the message and they're doing just fine but they're not in the message they're good good people even hold a lot of the standards you you hear of of of of people from outside dating these these people or or getting to know these these uh people that grew up in the message and they can tell there's a difference they have they still have that standard you know what I'm saying they might slip here and there and and and might not be serving the lord the way they're supposed to be and all those things that we've been taught and raised in and all those things but they still have something in the background there's something back there that they you've instilled raise up the child in the way that it should go and so they're holding on to part of it yeah right they've got some of it and there's a difference in in in a kid that's been uh a young person that's been raised up in this message and those that have just kind of it seems like they go crazy they go a little wild but there's always a tie right there's always something there when they get in trouble they know who to call right you understand what I'm saying but when this young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions it might not be money for some of our youth or some of you and that not might not be the problem this was the Rich Young Ruler maybe this was the the pretty young girl she had the looks she was pretty she liked that attention do you understand what I'm saying maybe that was her wealth maybe maybe the the the Mr athlete or or Mr popular whatever it might be what are you selling yourself out for you're at a Crossroads you're in a circumstance where God has given you something we all have something that God has given us and sometimes he wants us to use it for him for him yeah sometimes he wants us to give it up for him yes and this young man was at a Crossroads he says I've got all the teaching I've got all the knowledge I know exactly the way I'm supposed to live God says but for you for you I want you to give up all your wealth and come follow me yes Lord had a Crossroads is at a place he was facing a circumstance that he didn't know what to do with we're all going to come into that place be it a talent or or whatever it might be on how you're going to serve God he puts us in circumstances to see how we trust him amen he puts us right in the middle of everything this this young man said good Master he knew that Jesus was was somebody of of note amen he was willing to approach him and and and and and say I need to know more of you tell me about it good master I imagine this Rich Young Ruler was probably hoping that Jesus would say hey you got a few hundred bucks could you donate to the cause and that guy would walk away happy with chest puffed out yeah I helped Jesus I supported the ministry brother Brown says and come follow me he says what an opportunity that could have been Peter James or John one of them see the kid had been trained and brought upright and and been presented to Christ to use him in all the potentials that he had in him he'd been presented to Christ and all the potentials that he had in him he was at a Crossroads he was set up with the right kind of circumstances to be something like Peter and James and John yeah we know him as a Rich Young Ruler but what's his name think about that H to youed probably educated Young Rich influenced where he could have presented the gospel and yet turned it down what a rash thing that was for that young boy see follow me now see he had to follow someone now he had to either follow the influence of the people that he was associated with the influence of some young lady some influence of a gang of boys that he was associated with his colleagues in school or follow Jesus Christ in all of his goodness yet he knew he didn't have eternal life now look at that boy tonight what he could have been and what he is and what he is tonight he's somewhere he's a man he's somewhere he's waiting for waiting the Judgment he's waiting to face that Judgment Day Day turning down the same opportunity is presented to you kids almost under the same circumstance find kids good personality fine fathers and mothers what you have you don't even have to work L you want to see but there's something else that goes with that there is something goes with that that word tonight Never Dies it's still a challenge to every young man man every young woman follow me you're out of Crossroads young people God's not going to just let you float old people God's just not going to let you just float God doesn't have fence sitters he wants you to sell all that you have and give it to him you're faced with that circumstance today amen right now you're faced many of you have been coming to church for years and years and I've seen you start sitting on the front row and slowly you just scoop back further and further come on come on come on I see you you you in the youth meetings or in service and and some of you adults too you you're worshiping you're praising you're doing those things and eventually you look up you're faced with circumstance right now will you continue on your road the way it is circumstance look at what what's around you you have opportunity man I I wish oh I wish so badly I didn't waste so many years of my life yeah chasing me that's what it WS down to you're chasing you where's that peace I'm chasing it maybe it's in a bottle come on maybe it's in a pipe maybe it's women maybe it's men maybe it's who but you're chasing you you're looking for rest God has offered you rest amen yes sir he's offered you peace amen he's offered you Joy you couldn't pay me enough enough to go back to what I was there is no way and I have the opportunity I could do it in that quick how could you I'm talking in the flesh yeah I run into people all the time that got drugs I hate to tell you it's not like I don't have access to alcohol I got it when I wasn't supposed to what do you think's going to stop me from doing when I can the Holy Ghost and I've never been happier right I've never been at more peace yes the stress the worry all those things they might Peak but they go down real fast as soon as I hit my knees yeah says come follow me follow you Lord yeah follow me praise the Lord trust me praise the Lord thank you Lord quit Chasing You John and come follow me amen my what an opportunity what a peace that we can have what a peace you can have yes sir you think you're going to get married and and and everything's going to settle down first off who's crazy enough to marry youen there ain't no way and if they are crazy enough to marry you then they're just as [Music] crazy that's just where it is brother sister I don't know how to preach other than where I live so a wife or a husband's not going to solve your part problems a partner is not going to solve your problems yes the only solution is to understand what circumstance you're in and choose Jesus Christ amen every time 100% of the time there's never an option where the other option is better right that's true that's good come follow me quit chasing yourself amen man let's go to Genesis chapter 22 circumstance sorry verse four this is kind of a lengthy scripture but I think it's says then on the third day Abram lifted Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place far off and Abram Abraham said unto his young men abide here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you so God has spoke to Abraham and he told him take Isaac go sacrifice him something that you waited for for 25 years after you were already an old man and your wife was too yes God likes to put us in circumstances did you ever sat down and thought God what are you doing what are you doing amen what are you doing I'm going to say it again I i' I've asked him so many times why am I in this spot why is this where I'm at what do you mean you want me to do this what are you doing every time I get called to preach what are you doing why come on he put you in the circumstances that's true and he says just do it yeah yeah what ah you're joshing me you got to be kidding just do it true I waited 24 five years plus the 75 before that to have this child wow to have this promise to be where I'm at yeah my wife laughed at God circumstance yeah Abraham wasn't doing anything wrong that's right he was living according to what God wanted him to do yes sir and God throws him in this circumstance brothers and sisters it's not wrong to ask why sometimes it's just wrong when you say why no that's when it's wrong it's okay to as long as you do it the right spirit the right attitude there's nothing wrong with it I believe brother brand uh when that that sister was I can't remember I think she drowned and got uh brother brand told God you owe me an explanation and after all that God said I would have told you if you would have asked right yeah right yeah it's all about our attitude we're human he knows we're human he's fully aware that we are human in case you don't know God knows that you are human and you're going to make mistakes and you're going to say some stupid stuff and you're going to do some stupid stuff we could go down a whole list of of stupid that we do Abraham was doing what he was supposed to do yes he's raising his son yes God said I want you to go sacrifice him God you're sure about this yeah yeah yeah I'm sure now mature Christians for the most part not all the time people that have been down the road a little bit with God know when he tells you to do something it's best you go ahead and do it yes Abraham was mature the problem is when we're spiritually immature that's when we get in trouble yeah it's the TR amen and the reason we get to become mature Christians is because we were immature at some time and we had to learn a hard way through the circumstances that we were put in hard way right so take it from some people who know just go ahead and listen it's a whole lot easier just go ahead and do what God's telling you now Lord I'm not setting myself up for anything I'm just letting you know I'm not saying I'm super mature so verse 5 it says abide here but the the ass and I and the lad will go Y and worship and come again to you he didn't know how it was going to happen he didn't know how the plan was going to come together he knew the promise right he knew the promise that's the key is knowing the promise if you don't know the promise if you have no uh idea how God works works or what he does or what he's promised that's why it's important to read your Bible yes sir and to listen to messages and listen to tapes that's why it's important because you got to know what the promise is because the promise is the ultimate end result amen not the circumstance the promise Abraham knew that he had a promise so he was able to say me and the lad are coming back back even though he had a knife in his pocket right if you're aware of what the promise is it's a whole lot easier to face the circumstance head on Amen and do exactly what God says cuz you know what the promise is brothers and sisters if you wake up in the morning and you're scared to death of what the day is going to bring yeah amen of what your circumstances are yeah of what your uh bank account is of what your health is you're not aware of the promise promise yes let me say that again CU I don't think you understood what I said if you're scared to death to wake up in the morning and face your circumstance yeah on you're not aware of what the promise is amen well brother John you don't know what I'm going through you don't know this no I I don't I don't know what you're going through but I am fully aware of what the promise is that's right now maybe it's you know what the promise is but you don't know who you are and that's a whole another ball of wax that's a whole another problem if you don't know who you are we got to start there Abraham knew who he was he was the father of many nations amen and it was okay when God said Abraham take your son up there and sacrifice him H that sounds psychotic honestly that's I mean really that's crazy go ahead and start spreading the rumor that you're going to take your son on a mountain and kill him see how far you get that's crazy that's not right yes that circumstances is out of the realm of our thinking yes and Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father verse 7 and said my father and he said here am I my son and he and he said behold the fire and the wood but where's the lamb for a burnt offering that's how you know Abraham was living R his son was aware of what was supposed to happen if your children don't know how to pray they're not aware yeah I'm just going to just just chew on that a little bit our children should know how we live right amen there shouldn't be questions on the basic things how do we dress is this apparel appropriate I need to stop that's not my it's not my job but we need do you understand what I'm saying Isaac knew how to he he was aware of of the whole process the whole thing yeah and they came to the pl place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and he laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood now I want you to think about this Abraham is 100 years old thereabouts I didn't do the math I think uh Isaac was 13 and so you can do the math but he's an old man Isaac is a young man this is more confirmation that Isaac was raised right cuz I guarantee you if I tried to tie up my 13-year-old he's not a good example he's big uh but even still there ain't no way I can hold him down I'm sorry and and I'm not 50 years old yet but Isaac was submitted to his father yeah and Isaac understood that Abraham had faith in what God was doing yes cuz there ain't no 13-year-old boy that's just going to lay there and let him get tied up seeing a knife in his daddy's belt do you understand what I'm saying so this is the importance of of of showing not only being religious but living the life in front of our children God had a vision for what this was supposed to be and Isaac was a part of that he was in the scary side of it but yet there's this boy laying down allowing his daddy to tie him up and put him on the altar knowing what the altar was for Isaac showed so much Faith or Abraham showed so much faith in front of Isaac and brought him up and said God's going to do this God's got this he's going to take care of this over and over and over again that's all Isaac saw from Abraham was Faith yes he'd sit down and tell him say Isaac you know your mother and I were well past bearing a child in fact your half brother was your mother's idea cuz she didn't think she could do it but God God is faithful and true amen he is he every time he promises he comes through that's true yes sir sometimes it takes a while 25 years Isaac but he's faithful and true Isaac got so sick of hearing that but yet when it come time to test when it come to circumstances Isaac fell right in place why cuz he was taught he was showed it wasn't just we're going to church sit down and shut up daddy gets to church and he's worshiping there then he gets home and he's a totally different person no it was a life lived in Abraham verse 10 and Abram Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon thy lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing now I know that there fears God Abraham was doing everything right he was living his life right God had to put him in a circumstance he knew how Abraham would come out on the other side he's God do you think that was for God or for Abraham so we have an all knowing god and we're facing all kinds of circumstances yes and we're put in those positions is that for God or is that for us think about that God already knows Jo God wasn't like I don't know how Abraham's going to turn out boy I hope he gets through this one there's a lot of work getting that guy going God wasn't ringing his hands he knew exactly what how Abraham would respond but Abraham had to know how he would respond brothers and sisters when we're faced with circumstances God that's more confirmation for you where you are and who you are that's your confirmation why because we need those things we need to stockpile those things because we have to have faith to take a Rapture that's right we have to have faith when we're sick when it's really a dire situation so circumstance after circumstance is building up our faith building up our understanding of what God can do and how he wants to do it in us through us and who we are to him yes sir we often ask the question God why are you doing this to me the answer is for you God would you quit doing so much for me we all feel that way sometimes but he's doing that for us he's getting us Rapture Ready it's going to take Faith to get out of here yes that's why uh the scripture says that count it all joy yes count it all joy boy that's rough God you put me in this circumstance that I don't know what to do or how to do it count it all joy right rest right rest amen let's let's jump down and uh verse 13 and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a Ram caught in the thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for an burnt offering in the stead of the sun God's going to provide and Abraham called the the name of that place Jehovah Gyra that is to say to this day in the Mount of of the Lord it shall be seen Jehovah Gyra my provider my provider the Lord in the midst of my circumstances when I am overwhelmed with what God is asking me to do what God is asking me to go through yes sir he's provided a lamb amen he's provided a lamb in the middle of it all Jehovah Gyra and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said this is this is important verse 16 by myself have I sworn sayith the Lord by myself have I sworn I'm not counting on anybody else or anything else but by myself I'm put myself on the line why for because thou Hast done this thing and and Hast not withheld thy son thine only son said because you were obedient because you were obedient you wonder why obedience is so important here it is yes sir this is this is bride this is in John 3:16 this is bride material do you understand what I'm saying God so loved the world that's great but he didn't swear by himself for John 3:16 yes he swore to those who were obedient that's bride material thank you that's the difference that's who you are that's part of who you are that's what I was saying that's if you know who you are then it's easy to rest in his word in spite of the circumstances praise the Lord in that blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of Heaven and the Sands which is upon the SE seur and thy seed shall possess the Gate of the enemies wow we'll possess the gates of the enemies amen yeah according to obedience thank you Lord separation and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice circumstance you have a choice yes you have a choice you're living a good Christian life but your face was circumstance are you going to obey or are you going to chase yourself brothers and sisters we're human again I I'll say that again we like easy yeah right I think it was Staples that had that that commercial years ago with the hit the Easy Button we'd all hit it we'd wear that thing out easy we like easy we don't want to be sick we want to have plenty of money we want our kids to do the right thing that's easy where's your faith going to come from I'm predestinated yeah if you're predestinated then you're going to be tried wow remember what I said that these trials are for ourself if you're predestinated you've got to know that you're predestinated amen you've got to know not God God does know you're predestinated but you're the one who's got to know that you're predestinated doeses that make sense amen wow he's going to put us in circumstances and see if we obey he wants obedience in Abraham in 55 it says and about that time he heard something bleed and there was a little Ram hooked in the wilderness by his horns where did that Ram come from it was 100 miles from civilization and they was on up on top of the mountain and there was no water how did the ram get there God is still Jehovah Gyra no matter what the circumstance is he can provide the sacrifice at any time amen no matter what the circumstance is he is Jehovah Gyra amen no matter what the circumstance is no matter where you find yourself no matter what corner you get yourself backed into amen he's Jehovah Gyra [Music] amen Abraham was obedient and he found himself in some crazy circumstances yes sir just doing the what he's supposed to do that's where most of us live we we we live the best we can we're doing the best we can we might make mistakes but but overall I'm sure Abraham didn't wake up in a good mood every day but he was doing the best he could and and serving the lord the best he could God called on him to do something out of the ordinary presented him with a set of circumstances amen and he had to face him he had to be obedient true that's right let's turn to numbers actually let's go to Jonah I don't think I'm G to have time let's go to Jonah this is I love this little book I see myself in it so much I hate to say that there's things I don't want to do there's things I don't want to face now I've learned but this Jonah chapter 1 and we're going to read a lot of this because it it's really sets up now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amii saying arise and go to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee to tarus from the presence of the Lord and went down to japa and he found a ship going to Tarsus so that he paid the fair thereof so here's we know all know the story but I'm going to go over it because that's the way I feel like I should go Jonah is paying to get into a circumstance he's paying for it come out of his own wallet he's paying for that I know nobody else has been through that but me he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with him to tares from the presence of the Lord now he's running he's running from the presence of the Lord this is the opposite of Abraham this is disobedience but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a great Mighty Tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken then the Mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his God and cast forth the Wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them so these are Mariners they're praying they religious people we run into those in the South I don't know there's a lot of religious people people and I hate there's going to be a whole lot more religious people after this flooding that we've had do you understand what I'm saying I mean I'm not disparaging anybody but everybody gets religious when catastrophe happens and it's a I'm not downplaying the catastrophe I don't don't think I'm doing that but everybody goes to seeking after God sure when catastrophe happened bad things happen which is not a bad thing to do I'm not saying it's a bad thing that they shouldn't but they start pitching their Wars God why' this come upon me is it because I had a drug problem well I'm going to quit drinking I'm going to quit you know what I'm saying is that fair but Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he laid he lay and was fast asleep ah sleep what a nice Escape people are depressed they sleep right it's an Escape when they're worried if they can get their mind to sleep that's what the doctor said we just got to get you to sleep they want you to sleep rest rest Jonah is sewing all the signs that he's running from the presence of God so the shipmaster came unto him and said unto him what meanest thou Oh Sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not these guys are desperate saying okay look we don't know exactly what God to get a hold of we don't know exactly how God works we've got ours and maybe he'll work hopefully you have yours and if mine don't work maybe yours will right is that a fair statement just looking for some kind of God to do something there's only one God there's only one that can do anything about anything amen I appreciate their fervor and they said everyone to his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know whose cause this evil is upon us so they CAU cast lots and the lot fell upon I've always we won't go there I ain't got time then then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose cause this evil is upon us what is thine occupation and whence comest thou and what is thy country and of what people art thou H and he said unto them I am a Hebrew I fear the lord Lord just not enough and the god of the god of Heaven which made the Sea and the dry land I'm a Hebrew I Fear God and my God made the Sea and the land amen then the the men were exceedingly afraid and said unto him why hast thou done this for the men knew that he had fled from the presence of the Lord because he had told them so here's Jonah now we're going to slow down just a little bit because I don't have a lot of time but we're going to slow down just a little bit and look at this Jonah knew who he was yeah knew who God was and knew what he was doing how many of you and me don't raise your hands have known those three things and still ran from the presence of God we've known those things and yet we're still running now what I find interesting is that Jonah is willing to admit this and he knows God it's not like he was in the middle of the storm and they're casting lots and he forgot all about God and he forgot all about Solomon's Prayer and he forgot all about the temple forgot all those things but he was in such a place in such a state of mind now pay attention he was at such a place that he didn't think he could get a hold of God yeah cuz the devil had put so much guilt yeah so many questions and he said this is my bed I'm going to lay in it yeah cuz he knew he was disobedient he knew he was in the wrong he knew who was he knew what he should do and he knew what he was doing yes we serve a merciful god amen we serve a God who is ready for repentance at the drop of a hat we serve a God who is ready to restore us we serve a god who's ready to bring us all the way back [Music] wow but we get in the middle of these circumstances that we've created and the devil starts whispering in our ears if Jonah could face Solomon temple in the belly of a whale surely surely he could have faced Solomon's Temple on a boat where he could see nowhere they were going at least see the stars or whatever it might be yeah do you understand what I'm saying yes sir but but here we are in the midst of these troubles in the midst of the trials and we're running from God and the devil's got such control over our mind and such control over of over who we think we are the whole story about the whale could have been totally avoided he had a space to repent right there on the boat right there and then why do we wait so long how do we listen so long to the devil that's telling us will never amount to anything how could you call yourself a Christian how could you how could you even call on God's name he's holy and look at you you look at what you've become look at what you've done look at your circumstance you have put all these Mariners all these people on this boat in danger shame on you you call yourself a Christian [Music] he had a space to repent right there so many times when we feel ourselves getting pulled under that weight that's in our mind that mind battle we have a space to repent and calm the storm and they said unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may be calm unto us for the sea rought and was temptu God will move Heaven and Earth to get us Rapture Ready he will do whatever he has to do to get us Rapture Ready amen thank you Lord and it will affect the people around us it absolutely will affect people around us you mean it's my fault if you're one of his amen and he's got a plan he's willing to do whatever it takes to get you where you need to be amen the Rapture is going to happen yes sir and I can't say the Rapture is going to happen with or without you if you're one of his the Rapture is going to happen with you but you're going to be ready in order to get ready you're going to face some circumstance yes yes sir nevertheless the men rode hard to bring it to land but they could not they didn't want to throw Jonah overboard they were good moral people they didn't just want to make him fish food they they rode hard they pushed to get him to shore there's good people out there yeah they want to help you however they can but there's going to come a point where they're going to say sorry you're going in the drink because God has got to get us to that place yes sir again here's another face for Jonah to repent he didn't say wait a minute before you throw me over let me face Solomon's Temple I'm better off dead throw me in that's where he got to that was the mentality that's where the devil drives so many of us so long and that's why we stay in the slump and the stew that we get in we stay there because we choose to we don't look towards towards Jesus Christ God we're not worthy God why are you wasting time with me God I messed up over and over again why are you even spending time speaking to me I don't know why I go to church and we choose to stay there bless the truth the truth that's a trick of the devil right now I heard on a tape I think Shar seeds not air with a chook brother brandom said if you're out there right now I don't care if we're singing Whatever It Is come up to the altar we're here to get you to Christ that's the most important thing to get back to Christ amen get back to the promise I don't care what circumstance you're facing I don't care what what what you've been going through I mean I care but he really cares yes there's a space to repent there's a way to get back why put yourself through more and more and more so they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the Sea ceased from her raging what he went in Sea went calm that's called confirmation now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jon and Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights now maybe it's just me but in my mind I don't appreciate those three days and three nights Jonah was in the fish for three days and three nights he sat in his circumstances for three days and three nights three days and three nights amen and I don't know if it was the fact that he realized that he was still breathing that kind of woke him up to the fact that he was in the well the The Well of a baale the belly of a whale I mean that in itself is showing that God's got a plan if you're still breathing if you're still breathing God has a plan for you it is never too late amen chapter 2 three days and three nights and then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said I Cry by reason of my Affliction unto the Lord whose Affliction his Affliction who put him in that Affliction him yes sir it took him 3 days in a rough boat right yeah and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice I got to hurry and he said I cries Cried by reason of my Affliction un the Lord and uh for thou Hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas and the floods Compass about me all thy Billows and all thy waves are passed over me then said I I am cast out of thy sight yet will I look again unto thy Holy Temple he says I am cast out of thy sight was he cast out of God's sight sometimes turning back to God Amen is a process and you can tell what Jonah's going through here because I he says I was cast out of thy side that mind battle was still going the devil was still whispering in his ear the devil was still working on him it just sometimes it just takes a little stir just a little bit say oh God help me I know I'm not worthy God says you are he'll Whisper back you are thank you Jes for thou Hast cast me in the deep in the midst of the Sea and the floods Compass me about all thy Billows and the waves are passed over me then said I I said I am cast out of thy sight yet will I look again toward my Holy Temple and the waters can passed about me even to the soul and the dep closed me round about and the weeds were wrapped about my head symptoms circumstance symptoms and Circumstance yeah I went down to the bottom of the mountain the Earth with her bars was about me forever yet thou Hast brought up my life from corruption wow he's starting to recognize sometimes especially you learn this as you get older again but when you get down to pray it's like it's not going nowhere just just going nowhere and what the devil wants to do is get you up and doing something else that's what he wants to do because if you stay down there and you keep talking to him and you start getting sincere you go from I don't know who I am and I don't know why you'd even listen to me to talking lip to ear with God that's the jump but it's a process the devil's going to tell you all your circumstances he's going to tell you how worthless you are he's going to tell you that that God wants nothing to do with you that God's given up on you that God why would God love you why would God care yes sir and you start there but if you pursue pursue yes right after God sometimes he wants to be pursued he wants you to get serious he wants to see how much time you'll dedicate to him right sir how sincere you'll get with him amen amen how how hard you'll chase after him how bad you want to hear his voice right yes sir true if you stay there your language will change your thoughts will change your answers will come praise the Lord your peace will be restored hallelujah hallelujah because you pursued after God yes sir prayer is another circumstance you're tired you got 1,500 different things to do yeah but he wants you to pursue after him yes he does and he don't care what position you're in or where you're at amen I don't pray on my knees at night it's not not that that's not what I do you might do that that's okay yes I drive live and I talk to the Lord not with my eyes closed but I talk with the Lord yeah praise the Lord I'll be at work just start talking to him he doesn't care he just wants you to pursue after him don't stop if you find yourself falling asleep stand up walk around talk to him walking around yeah we've got too much form and fashion built into our mind that sometimes we miss out on God pursue after him yes than Jonah's in the belly of a whale do you think he was he was not I would get down and kneel but I would take for a to get back up so do you think his hands were folded oh Lord he's got seaweed wrapped around his head his circumstances were not the best when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came unto thee into thine Holy Temple they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy that's right they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy Jonah 2:8 I can't remember too many things but that is a scripture I remember yes sir no matter what your circumstance is no matter what you see around you Hallelujah no matter what you're facing the only real thing is God Amen that's good it's God hallelujah hallu he can take everything that you're facing amen right away you talk about an impossible situation there's nobody brother Bram says it too there's nobody facing what Jonah faced I got to I got to close they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay now he's paying a different thing I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord let's stand he paid a fair to get away from the presence of the Lord and now he's paying that how is he paying it with Thanksgiving with praise we all have a reason to praise we all have a pron a reason to thank God the fundamental foundation for Faith 1955 brother mam says now there's something that's wrong and in the beginning God has created you to be master of every circumstance God has created you to be master of every circumstance that's the origin that's authentic that's God's word there was nothing nothing could happen unless you was the master of it that's what you was created for oh that's what you were created for then sin came along through the fall and blinded the eyes of it and now Jesus came along and redeemed it back so we lost it with the fall but Jesus brought it back and now father gives you the Holy Spirit to lead you and guide you giving you all these Divine promises hallah God called you to be the master of circumstances wonderful praise name there's nothing we have to be afraid of yes sir there's no fear there's nothing that can overtake us yes Lord he's called us to be the master of our circumstances
