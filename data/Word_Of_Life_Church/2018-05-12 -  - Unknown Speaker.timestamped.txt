[15:23] it's faithful and true
[15:29] [Music]
[15:40] merci
[15:42] [Music]
[15:47] [Music]
[15:55] yes
[15:58] [Music]
[16:03] [Applause]
[16:05] [Music]
[16:10] praise the Lord for that American say
[16:14] amen to that for yourself to know that
[16:17] your redeemer is faithful and true the
[16:20] start of Ephesians 2:9 chapter 5 if you
[16:22] would verse 23 let's see how faithful he
[16:29] was fees in chapter 5 verse 23 we'd like
[16:35] to continue our studying looking at the
[16:38] church for the husband is the head of
[16:44] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[16:50] the church he is the savior of the body
[16:57] now remember at this time whenever the
[16:59] book of Ephesians is written there was
[17:02] not as you and I know today a Baptist
[17:05] Church
[17:05] Church of Christ Nazarene Unitarian
[17:09] Universalist Church Catholic Church
[17:11] church Church Church church Church
[17:13] so and they used the word church they
[17:16] was not thinking in the same way that
[17:18] you and I would think today today we
[17:20] definitely want to be designated as
[17:23] bride we don't like it if aperture calls
[17:25] us church I don't mind being called this
[17:27] church because this is the elect the
[17:30] called out so whenever they was writing
[17:33] about the church they didn't have to
[17:35] deal with what we have to deal with
[17:37] today therefore as the church is subject
[17:42] unto Christ so let the wives be to their
[17:47] own husband's in everything husbands
[17:51] love your wives even as Christ also
[17:57] loved the church and gave himself for it
[18:04] as Christ also loved the ecclesia the
[18:08] church and gave himself for it was
[18:13] prayer together and we'd like to be
[18:15] remembered to not before the Lord
[18:16] god bless you Heavenly Father we love
[18:19] you so much we're so so thankful in our
[18:22] hearts Lord Jesus to be identified in
[18:26] this great redeemed body of the Lord
[18:30] Jesus we thank you father for opening
[18:33] our hearts our understanding removing
[18:37] from us the shackles of Darkness taking
[18:41] the scales as it were from our eyes
[18:44] illuminating us and helping us to see
[18:46] and this day of such darkness when man
[18:49] is absolutely out of his mind
[18:52] the Lord people don't know what's right
[18:54] and wrong they don't know what's good or
[18:57] evil man is it the place to absolutely
[19:01] destroy himself but we are so grateful
[19:05] for the light of the gospel of this day
[19:08] we thank you lord
[19:09] we have lived in Laodicea another week
[19:13] by the grace of God and we have survived
[19:16] and we're looking for miracles we're
[19:19] bunches of them right here tonight we
[19:21] thank you for Lord we pray that should
[19:23] take your word and speak to us tonight
[19:25] anointest by your presence Lord may we
[19:28] see father a greater understanding of
[19:31] who you are and who we are together in
[19:33] unison of the word of God in Jesus name
[19:36] and the church said god bless you may be
[19:40] seated
[19:43] we know that Paul was given such a
[19:47] special understanding of the relation of
[19:50] the church and how that God had
[19:53] identified it in the full mystery of
[19:55] redemption unlike all the rest the
[19:58] apostles that wrote in the New Testament
[19:59] even of those that did not write very
[20:02] much but those who had preached
[20:04] historical document documents rather
[20:06] than you're able to find some of the
[20:08] things that they said just by reading
[20:10] their writings you see that Paul was
[20:13] given a very special understanding of
[20:16] the word God does that himself and no
[20:18] man cannot make that happen but God does
[20:20] that and Paul in choosing the example
[20:23] that he did he chose I believe is you
[20:26] believe by the Spirit of God he chose
[20:28] the great union of a man and his wife to
[20:32] be able to reflect the perfect union of
[20:35] Christ and the church because it is such
[20:38] a beautiful and perfect time now he
[20:41] could have chose a father and his
[20:43] daughter he could have chose a father
[20:45] and his son he could have chose a man
[20:49] and his friend and he could have chose
[20:51] different human relationships to
[20:54] identify Christ in the church but
[20:56] instead he chose the most perfect that
[21:00] he knew was given and identified in the
[21:02] Old Testament and that was between a man
[21:05] and his wife and we know that God of
[21:08] course reflected that in the Garden of
[21:10] Eden whenever God created man and woman
[21:12] placed him there and it was a perfect
[21:15] reflection of his own identity with his
[21:17] own attributes and thoughts now God had
[21:20] never expressed a bride intentional
[21:22] human form yet from the Garden of Eden
[21:24] but the mystery was unfolding as it did
[21:27] for his first son and daughter so here
[21:29] Paul picks it up again and he wants the
[21:31] church to be able to see what a great
[21:33] love that God had for them and how that
[21:36] love had developed and further unveiled
[21:39] itself in the New Testament verses the
[21:42] old now the Old Testament they could see
[21:43] that God loved him and that God had an
[21:46] identification
[21:46] Kayson with them they could see that God
[21:49] wanted to the test a tabernacle the
[21:51] tabernacle of witness the testimony of
[21:53] the law that God wanted something to be
[21:55] identified between him and Israel but
[21:58] yet the law could never be able to
[22:00] produce what grace could produce because
[22:03] the law put him in jail but grace got
[22:05] him out
[22:06] so here Paul is able to bring them to a
[22:09] higher level with a greater
[22:11] understanding now miss notices in verse
[22:13] 23 for the husband is the head of the
[22:17] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[22:21] church now we know of course when you're
[22:23] running a parallel like this it's it's
[22:25] comparing an ant to a man it's like
[22:28] comparing something that is so far apart
[22:31] but yet God uses parallels and
[22:34] allegories you know that Paul was famous
[22:36] for using allegories you use one the
[22:38] Galatians for whenever he compared of
[22:40] course Hagar mounts an eon and we know
[22:42] that allegories are a parable as earthly
[22:45] story with a heavenly meaning so God
[22:47] would compare something that would be as
[22:49] high as the heavens is above the earth
[22:51] yet it would have a very similar meaning
[22:54] or symbolism about which man would be
[22:56] able to understand so here Paul
[22:58] uses something that is so far apart in
[23:02] something that is so far
[23:04] WOB of one story above the other but yet
[23:06] he felt like the church not only them
[23:08] but the countless agents that would come
[23:10] thereafter would be able to identify
[23:12] with the story that he's going to unveil
[23:14] now the distance between these two
[23:17] stories is as far as heavens is above
[23:20] the earth notice now he says he is the
[23:22] savior of the body now he compares a man
[23:26] a true man that's in love with his wife
[23:30] a true man that knows the value of a
[23:33] godly wife and he compares that to
[23:35] Christ
[23:36] loving the church but he runs a parallel
[23:39] between subjection and headship and
[23:43] responsibility and authority now the
[23:45] verse contrasts between verse 23 and
[23:48] verse 24 now many men on the message of
[23:51] course are very very familiar with this
[23:53] verse of scripture they're very familiar
[23:56] with the quotes that lead them to the
[23:58] Almighty man
[23:59] home and the man is the boss and the man
[24:01] is this and the man is that and most men
[24:04] that I've found who had that attitude do
[24:06] not have a clue what it's even all about
[24:10] that's right now if a true man really
[24:14] understands headship he understand that
[24:17] it does not make him some type of
[24:19] dominating man that he's going around
[24:21] kicking his wife hitting his wife
[24:23] abusing his wife but he realizes that it
[24:27] puts him in a greater place of
[24:29] responsibility that's right because the
[24:32] Bible in the way that he relates it
[24:34] notice again in verse 24 therefore as
[24:37] the church is subject unto Christ so let
[24:40] the wives be to their own husband's in
[24:44] everything now first he brings the order
[24:47] of subjection how that the church is
[24:50] supposed to be subject to Christ and the
[24:52] woman is to the husband as the church is
[24:55] to Christ and then he goes into verse 5
[24:57] and expounds the parallel of how this
[25:00] headship will work and he said then
[25:02] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[25:05] also loved the church and gave himself
[25:07] for it now this is the greatest epitome
[25:11] of love that the world has ever known
[25:14] there has never been a love that is any
[25:17] greater than this you see this love is
[25:20] the type of love that the mighty elohim
[25:24] is expressing for the attributes which
[25:27] he cannot live without now john 3:16 is
[25:31] wonderful God loving the foolish version
[25:34] is wonderful God moving into the book of
[25:38] life and allowing people to be saved
[25:41] which are not even really his attributes
[25:43] that's wonderful but it cannot compare
[25:47] to the same kind of love that God has
[25:50] for his own body that's right Guarnere
[25:55] listen don't misunderstand me God
[25:57] absolutely could live without those
[26:00] people in the book of life God could
[26:04] live
[26:05] without the foolish version God could
[26:08] live without federal God could live
[26:12] without many many people who bent upon
[26:15] the earth but he cannot live without the
[26:18] elect that's right now think of it the
[26:23] grace of God will allow many of these
[26:25] people to be saved but they were never
[26:28] in that room of the eternal sinking of
[26:31] God from the very beginning in the realm
[26:34] of him condon seeing from the great
[26:36] eternal into the sphere by which in the
[26:38] beginning was the word and then from the
[26:41] eternal comes out the logos outlets of
[26:44] logos comes the attributes that was in
[26:46] him
[26:46] in the beginning of course that's when
[26:48] time began but before time began it was
[26:51] the eternal but you know what the
[26:53] foolish virgins was not there in him
[26:56] neither was those which are in the book
[26:58] of life they were not there in him then
[27:01] so the greatest reflection of that love
[27:04] is those for whom he had fully
[27:07] identified himself and so wrapped them
[27:10] up within himself that he considers
[27:14] himself without purpose of being unless
[27:18] they actually live the children of
[27:21] Israel gave him purpose and reason for
[27:24] being he busied himself for them in the
[27:27] Old Testament how much more has he done
[27:29] in the New Testament by the giving of
[27:32] his own token life amen now as I said
[27:36] this was the strongest love that the
[27:38] world has ever known now this is where
[27:40] that Paul brings the parallel to a man
[27:43] that really understands what headship
[27:45] was all about really loving his wife as
[27:48] a godly wife and a great gift from God
[27:50] but also was a great perspective of
[27:54] understanding in responsibility that
[27:56] that man loves her as Christ loved the
[28:00] church in realizing that well if she
[28:02] don't do what I want her to do I'll
[28:04] divorce and how give me another I don't
[28:06] care I'll get me a young word she's
[28:08] getting fat she's getting ugly she's
[28:10] getting fat and sassy I'll get rid of
[28:11] her boy I'll get
[28:12] they're brand-new now I'll get me a
[28:14] youngin out you and they they keep
[28:15] getting old
[28:16] I'll just want mom give me a Batman
[28:18] don't need to be married in the first
[28:19] place that's right that's not a man that
[28:22] loves his wife as Christ loved the
[28:25] church now come on Saints say Amen
[28:27] because he does not understand what
[28:30] headship really truly is now it follows
[28:33] them that a husband now listen carefully
[28:36] so you don't misunderstand me a husband
[28:38] cannot love his wife too much unless he
[28:44] puts her in front of God there is no
[28:47] danger of a man loving his wife too much
[28:51] being too kind oh my goodness you men
[28:54] are quiet no me not o not but yet in the
[28:57] example of Christ loving the church can
[29:00] Christ love you too much hello
[29:05] can he put a limitation on saying I can
[29:08] love you only so far and then I'll try
[29:11] love you so far I'm a skirt you're not
[29:13] going to love me back right he knows
[29:15] when he love me I could never love him
[29:18] as much as he loves me you see it is
[29:21] selfish life that keeps a record I love
[29:24] you more than you love me I do more for
[29:27] you than you do for me I say I love you
[29:30] 32 times and you only said 31 and 31 so
[29:33] with a grunt and a grumble so I'm not
[29:35] sure that even done it you know that is
[29:37] a very selfish love it keeps a record of
[29:41] all that is done according to first
[29:43] Corinthians 13 love does not keep a
[29:46] record well hallelujah oh I'll tell you
[29:51] this has made so real to me as actually
[29:53] sitting on this one ever eyes on the
[29:54] land of Israel and I was looking around
[29:56] to see the land that God gave to these
[29:58] people and realizing how that they in
[30:01] the Old Testament were the bride of God
[30:02] and how that God had moved for them time
[30:05] and time and time again and we stood
[30:08] upon a tale they tell us a place to
[30:10] where that the people in a civilization
[30:12] will build a city someone it would come
[30:14] in and conquer that city and instead of
[30:16] cleaning it all off they just level it
[30:18] out with more dirt sand and rocks and
[30:21] there
[30:21] on topic then they'd wipe them out
[30:23] somebody else would come in and build
[30:24] over just build it higher and higher and
[30:27] higher and higher and you realize each
[30:29] one of them will testify either of the
[30:32] grace or the judgment of God and that's
[30:35] why they could dig down so far and they
[30:37] would be able to pull out things of the
[30:39] Bronze Age Bronze Age then they would
[30:40] dig down so far deeper 20 feet deeper
[30:43] and they were dig down to them maybe
[30:44] another age and another age then others
[30:46] right in the same place because it would
[30:49] have been a strategic place every one of
[30:51] them told a story and you realize the
[30:54] grace of God giving to each one of them
[30:57] and giving them Mercia man they turned
[30:59] it down God would send an army and then
[31:01] they'd kill them to take it over and I
[31:03] thought how many times in the children
[31:05] it'll stand here in this place and now
[31:08] they've driven everywhere all over the
[31:10] earth and yet the grace of God still
[31:12] calling that 144,000 back we're standing
[31:15] by the way and while the other day a
[31:16] couple of brothers as I said think of it
[31:18] Moses and Elijah could be sent over
[31:20] against that wall right now Priam
[31:22] I believe we are that close Church I
[31:25] believe Moses and Elijah are alive
[31:28] remember the prophet else's question in
[31:29] 64
[31:30] it'll probably be two men anointed with
[31:33] the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of
[31:35] Moses
[31:36] they're alive tonight don't lie tonight
[31:40] they're probably woke in the shoots of
[31:42] Jerusalem or Bethlehem or somewhere over
[31:44] there waiting for the hour what for for
[31:47] you and I to get ready to leave this
[31:48] world
[31:49] amen they cannot step in their ministry
[31:52] to the bride is gone that's right now
[31:55] what's the sin if a man loves his wife
[31:58] the way that Christ loves the church now
[32:01] that love of course is the model love by
[32:03] which God gave so what does Paul go on
[32:05] to say that he gave he loved his new
[32:08] church so much his white church so much
[32:10] that he gave himself for it that here
[32:14] again is a model by which God projects
[32:16] that a true man will truly love his wife
[32:19] in that he would be willing to die for
[32:22] her he would be willing to give his life
[32:25] for her if need be if someone was
[32:28] kill him or her want a true man that
[32:30] really loved his wife would not push her
[32:33] out and say take her I've got a greater
[32:35] purpose silly boy I'd take her nope if
[32:38] he loves her right he will be willing to
[32:40] give it all but I've gone out that's the
[32:42] way I'll feel about my wife I tell you
[32:45] one thing I'd die for you you're lying
[32:47] unless you're willing to live for now
[32:50] don't tell me what you do if your face
[32:53] of the guns as most of you know she'll
[32:55] never be able to face with that but we
[32:57] are telling me why the way you would
[32:59] really do by the way you live and treat
[33:01] her every day she say it's the same way
[33:04] with the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus tells
[33:07] me and proves to me his love by the way
[33:10] he treats me every day of my life he
[33:13] noticed me when I don't deserve it
[33:15] he's good to me when I'm not I'm not
[33:17] good back come on church he helps me
[33:20] when I'm down
[33:21] he helps me oh my goodness I'm not
[33:23] worthy of 100 to 1 percent of the
[33:26] blessings that I get but he's allowed
[33:28] for me is so much greater than anything
[33:31] I could ever get by he doesn't keep a
[33:34] record up on heaven and a tally book I
[33:36] know there's a book there but you know
[33:38] what the book is the book is the few
[33:41] things that I do
[33:42] there is no scripture there is no quotes
[33:46] that I have ever found that when we get
[33:48] there that day he will drag out his book
[33:51] and show us what all he done for us
[33:54] while we were in life but he keeps a
[33:56] record all right it will be our little
[33:59] measly record of life that we have lived
[34:02] on this earth that he by His grace give
[34:05] us power to live and he will give us a
[34:08] reward that day in heaven that's a true
[34:14] man right there now he gave himself in
[34:18] order to redeem this church this of
[34:21] course there's a model love by which
[34:23] every man should love his wife you young
[34:25] sisters that aren't married this is the
[34:27] kind of man you want you don't want no
[34:29] selfish man that he's talking about
[34:31] marriage and you listen to them and
[34:33] he'll tell
[34:34] about what he's expecting out of you and
[34:36] what you can expect out of him I want a
[34:39] wife that'll do this and I want a wife
[34:41] that'll do that and I want a wife it'll
[34:43] lose something else run sis run if he's
[34:49] not telling you what he's gonna do and
[34:51] what his plans are for you and it's all
[34:54] about him you better head out of here as
[34:56] fast as you can
[34:58] now his willingness to suffer for his
[35:02] bride
[35:03] I give his life of course in all the
[35:05] atonement that he did reflects to us
[35:07] what he did that one time but if he
[35:10] stopped there that would have been a
[35:11] tremendous price you agree with me on
[35:13] that but think of it he's done so much
[35:15] more for us even after we got saved he
[35:19] keeps us he has gives us peace he gives
[35:22] us joy helps us in the time of trouble
[35:24] woman don't know what to do when were up
[35:26] when we're down were a member out
[35:28] whatever was constantly expressing his
[35:30] love
[35:31] whatever we deserve it there's times if
[35:33] we do pretty good by that and yet
[35:35] there's time so we don't worry because
[35:36] he took it upon himself that his wife
[35:41] would be happy in this life you see how
[35:44] Paul parallels that a man who really
[35:47] loves his wife in the right way he will
[35:49] love her with a very unselfish undying
[35:53] love he's here not only to have a friend
[35:56] and a companion but he looks at her as
[35:59] being his responsibility in order to be
[36:03] able to produce as much happiness as he
[36:05] can well even the men's quiet the
[36:07] woman's quiet the kids are even quiet
[36:10] I wish Leah Maria was here them the
[36:13] little things about that hound they
[36:14] stand out and praise the Lord and say
[36:16] amen
[36:16] oh my they're gurgling tune I got no
[36:19] amens now this is the time of a love
[36:24] that God has for his church and this is
[36:27] the type of love that God wants sons of
[36:30] God to have for their well but the dami
[36:34] shed
[36:35] see Angela that's your fault for me
[36:39] [Applause]
[36:41] you ought to pray more oh Jesus
[36:51] it is the duty of a man who is truly
[36:55] married and committed to God also to
[36:59] this wife to support her in sickness
[37:02] inhales not only to work I make a living
[37:05] par praise the Lord I should have come
[37:11] over and recorded amens today to provide
[37:14] for her needs to keep her from danger
[37:19] peril difficulty praise the Lord
[37:25] not flirting with other women you say
[37:29] you love your wife and got girlfriends
[37:30] on Facebook you're a bold-faced liar and
[37:33] a hypocrite you see if a man has the
[37:40] spirit of self-denial then what will he
[37:44] think about oh you make it sound like
[37:47] that a man's supposed to eat dream Berg
[37:49] drink wife wife life what do you think
[37:53] he eats drinks breathes talks about
[37:55] [Applause]
[37:56] [Music]
[37:58] [Applause]
[38:02] mother don't you why you always
[38:04] preaching on them in you get some of
[38:05] these sorry hiding min around the
[38:07] message straightened down the wife so
[38:09] get straightened out reason all the
[38:11] woman's how their place cuz the man
[38:13] ain't in theirs well praise the Lord
[38:19] now the church then is a mirror
[38:23] reflection of that very same thing so
[38:26] you look at the church the church world
[38:30] tell them they're not supposed to dress
[38:32] indecent they're supposed to dress
[38:34] modest know what you know that ain't
[38:37] none of your business what preacher and
[38:41] right mind tells women how to dress
[38:43] the only preachers us in their right
[38:45] mind till women head of this all the
[38:47] rest sums crazy
[38:49] hey well ain't none of your business
[38:53] it is my business I'm a shepherd
[38:57] that's exactly right and to love a woman
[39:01] the way that God loves the church my
[39:04] it's absolutely phenomenal to see how
[39:06] that and God can equip a man to be able
[39:09] to do this you do believe this is
[39:11] absolutely a command of God now this is
[39:13] not an optional I power windows so we
[39:16] find then that the authority of the man
[39:19] over the woman is not because of his
[39:24] gender the authority of the man over the
[39:29] woman is not the very next verse a verse
[39:31] after Paul deals with this and says
[39:34] simply because he's a man and because he
[39:38] can father children it's based on one
[39:44] thing his lover
[39:48] now Paul actually offsets the bitterness
[39:52] of women being subject to their husbands
[39:56] because he knew some would struggle with
[39:58] it if not all oh god I'm going back here
[40:11] so what does he offset telling the women
[40:15] to be subject to their husbands with the
[40:18] man's love being so strong so supportive
[40:24] so much like Christ it offsets the
[40:28] bitterness of her subjection you see
[40:32] this is why sometimes many women
[40:35] struggle was being subject to their
[40:38] husbands because they got a demanding
[40:41] husband that demands they do their and
[40:43] demands they to the anger man's they do
[40:47] something else but he don't love her
[40:49] right and she struggles and then he it's
[40:52] just a circle that never ends she
[40:55] rebelled against him and he'll saw it
[40:56] back in her face and then he'll throw it
[40:59] back in her face and she'll throw it
[41:01] back in their face and the skillet every
[41:02] now and then
[41:03] pancakes it and then they just keep
[41:05] going you know because here's all you
[41:07] don't obey me woman could it be it's
[41:12] because you don't love her right
[41:14] [Applause]
[41:18] now why why when you look at the
[41:21] parallel of this God could love the
[41:24] church because he's God
[41:27] I'm God I want to love the SATs nobody's
[41:34] gonna stop me from got it well I'd serve
[41:39] him but I'd be scared to death of him I
[41:44] know what it is that's the way I used to
[41:46] serve him in Pentecost
[41:48] that's one thing I thought I heard when
[41:50] I heard the prophet on these tapes it
[41:52] freed me from that bondage really so how
[41:57] does he base his lie the book of
[42:00] redemption the mr. dibbs what's it based
[42:02] on he gave himself for us so then his
[42:08] authority is not because he's they all
[42:11] mauriello him always did base it on that
[42:14] but it's used to base it on love now the
[42:23] woman that finds it hard to subject
[42:27] yourself look at the parallel of the
[42:31] church for those of us who would
[42:34] struggle with certain things in the word
[42:36] and all the word says we shouldn't do
[42:38] this without of the other whatever it is
[42:39] that you struggle this in your life and
[42:42] many times we live in war when I go to
[42:44] church I'll tell what God's gonna wear
[42:46] me out I he I deserve a whipping he
[42:48] ought to just bend me over his knee and
[42:50] a lot of times what do you find he gives
[42:53] you grace and mercy and you're sitting
[42:55] there struggling within yourself
[42:56] thinking I'm not even worthy of that I'm
[42:59] not even worth god I want you to smack
[43:02] me down the aisle and hit me about three
[43:03] or four times you know I you got
[43:05] spiritual though beating wife syndrome
[43:07] that's what you think God could do but
[43:09] instead he loves you and he wants to
[43:12] watch the love for the love is to help
[43:14] you to be subject to his word so instead
[43:18] of just sweating himself out on the old
[43:20] mighty club down you
[43:21] question me you disobey my world I'll do
[43:24] this and that in the other no but
[43:27] instead he loves you to obedience oh
[43:32] praise God you see friends Jesus didn't
[43:36] just pity the church he did not pity his
[43:41] he left out I feel so sorry for him oh
[43:44] poor little things
[43:46] little hearts I feel so sorry for look
[43:50] so pitiful
[43:54] it wasn't pity it was a reciprocating
[43:59] love that resounded from his being not a
[44:04] pity that alga that this is the way of
[44:06] course the gospel is preached Oh
[44:08] somebody feel sorry for God God said
[44:10] he's poor little boy Danny already died
[44:12] don't y'all feel sorry for him oh my
[44:14] goodness don't look at them scars look
[44:16] at all that blood don't you feel sorry
[44:18] for her that's the way they preach it
[44:20] that's not my god neither did you go
[44:24] down journey abroad and say poor little
[44:26] wretched thing ain't nobody that can
[44:28] save them all maybe I'll go down he knew
[44:30] who was his from the very beginning he
[44:35] didn't look at you with pity he looked
[44:37] at you with desire there is a difference
[44:42] and pity and desire so he looked at you
[44:50] with desire with your good in mind so
[44:58] tell me what did the cross do for him
[45:02] what did becoming a human being do for
[45:06] the Lord Jesus what did he gain him what
[45:12] good did it do it going to hell
[45:16] burying our sins becoming sin what good
[45:19] did it do him personally at Marty's name
[45:24] at Marty's body
[45:26] Marty's reputation
[45:30] so apparently he was doing it for
[45:32] somebody else you may now man come on
[45:39] crow now husbands love your wives as
[45:43] Christ loved the church praise be to God
[45:48] oh my the spirit that Christ projected
[45:53] is the very thing of course that was
[45:55] able from the very heart of God to bring
[45:58] the church to such a place why would it
[46:01] be so your name are engraved on the
[46:05] palms of his hands I'll tell you one
[46:12] thing when man Carol got married almost
[46:13] 45 years ago we didn't get married with
[46:16] divorce in mind I know our messages he
[46:21] therefore divorce they don't make it
[46:23] right I don't care how many does it I
[46:27] still say the same vile so del Sol still
[46:30] part praise the Lord praise the Lord
[46:35] divorce if you eared into the divorce in
[46:38] mind no doubt you'll need that option so
[46:41] I people coming to God well I want to
[46:43] try Jesus oh you're gonna try and like
[46:45] grapefruit juice or orange juice and if
[46:47] you don't like grapefruit you go to
[46:48] Orange if you don't like orange you go
[46:49] to mango once you really approach the
[46:51] Lord Jesus you realize you ain't gonna
[46:53] try nothin else because he's the only
[46:56] one there's a lot here he's one among
[46:58] many he is the only one there is nothing
[47:01] else I could satisfy there's nothing
[47:03] else that can be able to quench a thirst
[47:05] but if you come to well I'm gonna try
[47:07] and sit for like and I'll keep my music
[47:09] I'll keep my worldly stuff and if I
[47:11] don't like him I'll go back to it more
[47:13] than likely you will but if you really
[47:15] are cold of God all that well I'm not
[47:18] sure I can be able to obey it I'm not
[47:20] sure that I can do it if you fall in
[47:23] love with him and him we're here so
[47:25] mrs. and subjection is automatic why he
[47:36] longed for a return of a loving intimate
[47:49] he longed for a return and it didn't
[47:59] just want to save you and just at the
[48:02] end of the road do something for you
[48:03] then but he actually wanted you to be
[48:06] happy go on that way to me it's a shame
[48:10] that we let the devil rob us of our joy
[48:12] and our happiness and our fees the Lord
[48:14] Jesus has done so much along the way to
[48:16] make us happy
[48:17] I realize we got a lot of things against
[48:19] his friends I nobody got circumstances
[48:21] there are things in our home family
[48:23] disease sickness troubles and so on and
[48:25] so on but does all that override the
[48:27] bounty of our God this should gone
[48:28] there's something wrong with our faith
[48:30] from Fidel's us over and over again we
[48:32] have untapped resources in Christ we
[48:35] have reserves and the goodness of God
[48:37] we've never even broke into you think
[48:41] you're gonna run out of joy you think
[48:43] our God's gonna run out of healing for
[48:45] the rapture
[48:45] I tell you no he ain't gonna run out of
[48:48] joy he ought to run out of peace he
[48:50] ain't gonna run out of satisfaction why
[48:52] don't some of us hop into it
[48:54] oh my the love of the Lord Jesus for his
[49:02] bride is so great he counts himself
[49:08] incomplete without you
[49:21] you say that's a pretty heavy statement
[49:23] it is lean not to your own understanding
[49:26] so you see if you were in the
[49:28] foreknowledge of God then you're
[49:30] becoming a part of God it's the only way
[49:32] you can be a son of God or a daughter of
[49:34] God you had to be a part of God and God
[49:37] isn't complete without you now this is
[49:45] only attributes he could be perfectly
[49:50] complete without foolish virgin
[49:56] somebodies ponder on that issue you're
[49:59] recycling it again you didn't get it the
[50:01] first time and you're really sucking it
[50:02] again they're not part of his eternal
[50:04] being the sea is not part of his eternal
[50:11] being tongue said I so no more sea
[50:18] storms are not part of his eternal being
[50:22] he will be complete without them well
[50:26] Rory to God but he cannot be complete
[50:29] without the alert oh my god isn't
[50:37] complete without you has to be that's
[50:39] right cuz there's only there's one one
[50:42] only one resource of eternal life and
[50:45] that is God and him alone has eternal
[50:47] life now and you were a part of him in
[50:51] so much that you're an attribute our in
[50:55] his thinking in the beginning and that
[50:58] because he thought of you in the
[51:00] beginning
[51:01] gives listen I bat out a spell to see
[51:05] them when I read this it gives that
[51:07] little tug towards him oh you've been
[51:13] thinking all this while that was your
[51:15] free moral agency you've been thinking
[51:18] about something you done that little tug
[51:20] you fellas him Todd you fellas not you
[51:25] it was him now listen it gives you that
[51:36] little tug toward him that's what has to
[51:40] be quickened it's that little tug your
[51:48] old man can't be born again your old man
[51:51] can't be quickened the tug is what's
[51:55] quickened some of them will never be
[52:02] quickened they just don't have it that's
[52:06] all or children well if it's a happy
[52:11] enough
[52:12] notice what phone as he goes to
[52:15] Ephesians chapter 1 yes put all things
[52:17] under his feet and gave him to be the
[52:20] head over all things to the church which
[52:26] is his body the fullness of him that
[52:32] filleth all in all you mean the church
[52:36] is the fullness of the Lord Jesus in him
[52:43] dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[52:46] in the true church Joseph's fullness of
[52:49] the Lord Jesus not in you now not in me
[52:54] but in us this is why we need one
[52:57] another miss a devil that tries to pull
[53:01] you off away from church and pull you
[53:02] off away from one another come on cuz
[53:05] the devil knows no matter how strong you
[53:07] are as an individual your own in a
[53:09] little portion of this thing you're not
[53:11] the whole thing that's right which is
[53:16] his body the fullness of him that
[53:18] filleth all in all so as the woman is
[53:22] the glory of the man that glory is
[53:25] reflected by the way she dresses and
[53:28] also by her hair that of course is the
[53:31] crowning agent of the ministry of the
[53:33] man himself God made the man first of
[53:36] course they made the woman Eve staying
[53:38] in her place and they go ahead and say
[53:39] it this way there was only one man that
[53:42] ever had a perfect wife and there's only
[53:45] one woman that ever had a perfect
[53:48] husband all the rest of us have flawed
[53:51] wives and flawed husbands
[53:56] that's right they were perfect I don't
[53:58] know how long they lasted but I was
[54:00] perfect initially but all the rest of us
[54:02] are flawed but the thing of it is if we
[54:04] follow the leading of the Lord in the
[54:06] woman of the man that we married then
[54:08] God will correlate our flaws to where
[54:11] that the man being followed the woman
[54:13] being flawed they'll be able to work
[54:15] together under the harmony of holy
[54:16] wedlock in order to make both of you a
[54:19] better person than what she was before
[54:21] you got married
[54:23] that's right now you see many want to
[54:26] marry a woman and they want to be able
[54:28] to multiple select what they want out of
[54:30] her get rid of this get rid of this I
[54:32] want that get rid of that I wish this I
[54:33] want that I want that well you know you
[54:35] need to make a frankincense what you
[54:37] need to do just make the kind of woman
[54:39] that you want or is it may be that you
[54:44] need to be remade now Paul when he goes
[54:51] into the part about subjection of the
[54:53] woman they're paralleling it to the
[54:55] church and then the headship of the man
[54:57] being reflected by divine love notice
[54:59] this in verse 26 he said that he might
[55:02] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[55:05] of water by the word that he bounces it
[55:08] back and forth from the woman the man
[55:09] and the woman to though to the Christ
[55:11] and the church as brother Wren does
[55:13] marriage and divorce is one reason why
[55:14] people misunderstand marry divorce
[55:15] because brother n goes from man the
[55:17] woman to Christ the church men who own
[55:18] the Christ Church man and woman across
[55:20] church so Paul does Ephesians 5 exactly
[55:22] the same way so he moves from the man
[55:24] now and the woman down to verse 26
[55:27] speaking of Christ that he might
[55:29] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[55:32] of water by the word now look at this
[55:34] word sanctified is Hagi's hill which
[55:36] means hallow be wholly separate from
[55:39] profane things and dedicate to God to
[55:43] consecrate to purify so God wants his
[55:47] bride his wife the church to be separate
[55:50] from the things of the world now I
[55:52] wouldn't want my wife going around
[55:55] flirting with every man in this church I
[55:56] wouldn't want to go around for it with
[55:58] one
[55:59] [Music]
[56:00] if I've seen my wife having all kinds of
[56:03] pictures of herself with other men in
[56:05] this church posted on Facebook if I had
[56:07] such I wouldn't like it I don't want her
[56:14] dressing in such a way that's going to
[56:16] get men's attention what she is is mine
[56:20] it's not for sale
[56:22] and it's not for anybody else to look at
[56:24] come on don't get quiet out what Christ
[56:27] feels the same way about his church he
[56:31] redeemed her he sanctified her he
[56:33] watched her and he does not want her
[56:36] looking light of the world that's right
[56:39] and he sanctified her by the washing of
[56:42] the water of the Rhema and ordered that
[56:46] she might be constantly cleanse now
[56:48] itself of the washing of the water of
[56:49] the logos which the logos is that which
[56:52] has been written maybe hundreds and
[56:53] hundreds of years ago the washing of the
[56:56] water of the word remember when they
[56:58] take the sacrifice when a woman will be
[57:00] come in from having a boy child or a
[57:02] girl child and she would have to have a
[57:04] certain offering and from but also with
[57:05] the leprosy then when they would come in
[57:07] by lectures they they would come in and
[57:09] offer a certain offering and then they
[57:10] must also have running water
[57:12] jeonyul of course the temple being built
[57:14] in Jerusalem they come from the brook
[57:16] Kidron and they would have running water
[57:18] it could not be water that was stored up
[57:20] in a cistern to be able to use and the
[57:23] sacrifices it had to be running water so
[57:26] the running water was used in the
[57:28] cleansing of leprosy which is sin also
[57:30] cleansing of a woman who had a child and
[57:32] it must be running fresh water now it's
[57:36] not stored up something that was 75
[57:38] years ago 500 years ago whatever more
[57:41] but the washing of the water to cleanse
[57:43] the church is the on coming revelation
[57:47] of the present day truth and it is still
[57:49] running it's not dammed up so those
[57:51] folks in the message you try to dam it
[57:53] up here they are there you know what
[57:55] they're totally breaking the type going
[57:57] into a denomination because it is a
[57:59] denominational system the dams of the
[58:02] water of God
[58:03] well however yeah so in order to be
[58:07] cleansed in order to be sanctified now
[58:10] we were sanctified of course when we
[58:12] come to him in the initiation of the
[58:14] bride marriage to him Christ the word
[58:16] but the sanctification does not stop
[58:19] there living in a dirty filthy world we
[58:21] had to be washed over and over again how
[58:24] many even say him into that if you all
[58:25] had to repent so far this week this is
[58:27] Wednesday maybe I - the Lord to forgive
[58:29] you for thinking this say on that Lord
[58:31] get police help me God what is it now
[58:33] what are you doing your inning in to the
[58:36] original bass or the sacrificial water
[58:38] of the washing of the word of God it
[58:41] keeps you clean not only in order to be
[58:43] married to Christ the word as Esther was
[58:46] but it is a continual washing man to
[58:52] consecrate or to purify and in this of
[58:55] course is an allusion as it was Esther
[58:57] in the Old Testament that a woman would
[58:59] come to be married to the king they
[59:01] couldn't come straight from their
[59:03] fathers how about them of course a very
[59:04] poor they very poor food coarse food and
[59:07] this food would actually produce an odor
[59:09] their flesh would begin to take on the
[59:11] sin of the way the type of food that
[59:14] they ate now they were very poor so they
[59:16] very crude types of things and the king
[59:18] himself would eat light or delicate
[59:20] types of foods so they wanted to cleanse
[59:22] someone now I didn't take that long to
[59:24] wash your body but it took that long to
[59:26] detox as we can say in order to her hurt
[59:29] and now they changed her diet
[59:31] they didn't just perfume the woman but
[59:32] they started feeding her seven seals
[59:35] seven thunders opening of the word so as
[59:39] she started feeding on that word and
[59:41] taking that word into her body her body
[59:43] absorbing these nutrients calcium and
[59:45] carbohydrates all this it actually
[59:47] produced a more fragrant smell out of
[59:50] the woman's body itself I wish somebody
[59:53] would help me preach them you know it
[59:55] because it changed her died from the
[59:57] crude course bad this stuff that she fed
[59:59] on for so many years
[1:00:00] then she started eating on eagle food
[1:00:03] the son of man the reveal word and what
[1:00:05] it done it actually start bringing her
[1:00:07] flesh
[1:00:09] just started bringing her flash subject
[1:00:13] to the new diet that she was either a
[1:00:16] man and you could tell that she was in
[1:00:19] the king's court because her flesh was
[1:00:21] being brought subject to the Kings diet
[1:00:27] and then they would soak her and myrrh
[1:00:30] and they were so now what's all there
[1:00:32] for that's not for her spirit
[1:00:34] that's not for her brain that's not for
[1:00:36] her intially what's it to do to change
[1:00:38] the fragrance of her body to change the
[1:00:41] fragrance of her flesh from within and
[1:00:44] from without glory to God but they
[1:00:47] started feeding her it would do no good
[1:00:49] to constantly give her a bath in all of
[1:00:52] myrrh and all of frankincense and all
[1:00:54] them other oils if she's constantly
[1:00:56] eating no junk food that makes her smell
[1:00:59] like the world what good does they do to
[1:01:02] go to church and be washed by the water
[1:01:04] the word when you're down Sunday morning
[1:01:07] and still feeding on junk and feeding on
[1:01:10] the world and of all churches and that's
[1:01:12] your diet you've got to have a cleansing
[1:01:14] from Earth and I'm from without whoa
[1:01:21] praise the Lord
[1:01:29] so this washing consisted of expensive
[1:01:33] unguents of perfumes and apothecaries
[1:01:37] about what's the woman's odor would
[1:01:41] begin to transform she smelled like a
[1:01:47] poor girl when she came in but before
[1:01:50] long meal by meal bath by bass she
[1:01:55] started smelling like a queen Aaron
[1:02:03] walked into the presence of Moses one
[1:02:05] day just looked like any other ordinary
[1:02:08] man but Moses give him a bath now he's
[1:02:15] an old man he's giving himself a bath
[1:02:16] for a long time but this time he needed
[1:02:19] the bath by a prophet lowered and when
[1:02:24] the Prophet gave him that bass God
[1:02:26] already had an ointment I've been a
[1:02:29] pounding together by the Apothecary of
[1:02:31] that day a special anjuman of odors by
[1:02:35] which they would put together which was
[1:02:37] totally forbidden by any other Israelite
[1:02:39] to wear nobody I don't care if you're
[1:02:43] rich or poor whoever you was it was kept
[1:02:45] only for the high priest that man took
[1:02:50] off his modernist ephod in the urine
[1:02:52] Thummim and everything you still know
[1:02:54] who he was by the way smelled
[1:03:04] I'll tell your friend this bride puts
[1:03:06] off a fragrance a man it ain't just when
[1:03:09] she's in church she don't smell like the
[1:03:12] lily of the valley and smell like a
[1:03:13] polecat on Monday morning come on
[1:03:18] she don't smell like a fragrant rose in
[1:03:21] church on Sunday and then smell like a a
[1:03:23] garbage heap on Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:03:25] Thursday Friday Saturday but that woke
[1:03:28] her everyday woke is anointed with the
[1:03:31] ansan of the Holy Ghost this is the word
[1:03:34] we get unction from an unction from the
[1:03:38] Holy Ghost praise be to God praise be to
[1:03:48] God by the washing of the water mother
[1:03:53] Rhema Living Word you see the difference
[1:03:58] between a selfish love and an unselfish
[1:04:03] love is see in this allegory between
[1:04:08] Christ and the church a man and a woman
[1:04:11] in that a man who marries a woman for
[1:04:16] selfish reasons only all a woman marries
[1:04:19] a man for selfish reasons not for what
[1:04:23] she can become not that she can take
[1:04:26] that man be a real wife and a real queen
[1:04:29] - but with the concept of what she
[1:04:33] basically can get out of it Sampson was
[1:04:36] the epitome of a very selfish man he was
[1:04:44] a Jew he was elect but he was a selfish
[1:04:47] individual why do you want what he
[1:04:51] wanted he did not want what was best for
[1:04:54] the church he did not want what most
[1:04:57] best even for Delilah
[1:04:59] sorry elephant what did he want what was
[1:05:05] best for Samson he did not keep the
[1:05:09] secret of God why because he wanted what
[1:05:11] was best for Samson the epitome of a
[1:05:15] selfish
[1:05:16] oh you see an unselfish lover constrains
[1:05:22] himself to the submission of God first
[1:05:27] you know the order of real true headship
[1:05:30] it's not the man being the dominant King
[1:05:34] in the whole and him subjects and nobody
[1:05:37] else
[1:05:37] a man Locke gets a tyrant you young
[1:05:42] girls looking for a husband tsehai
[1:05:44] relates to his pastor that'll kind of
[1:05:48] tell you what your future homes going to
[1:05:49] be if he's got the eye idea that he's a
[1:05:52] Hitler that's probably what you're gonna
[1:05:53] marry mr. ad off himself I don't need
[1:05:58] the pastor bless God I do what I want
[1:06:00] you better stay away from him since
[1:06:02] you're fixing to marry a dictator
[1:06:06] amen brother Nami
[1:06:08] preach brother darling I'm with you
[1:06:11] brother darling you see an unselfish
[1:06:17] lever that loves his wife he's not gonna
[1:06:20] do things it's going to damage her no
[1:06:23] more than Christ now I know Pope's look
[1:06:25] out and they get an attitude against the
[1:06:27] Lord Jesus he took my makeup away he
[1:06:29] took not this so he took my cigarettes
[1:06:31] away you got a problem with that
[1:06:33] he took my alcohol the way probably kept
[1:06:35] me from know how for Oden killings have
[1:06:37] id+ killing yourself three or four times
[1:06:38] and you've got a problem it's that
[1:06:41] anything he takes from you it's for your
[1:06:44] good
[1:06:45] but Satan will try to turn your attitude
[1:06:48] against him it's the same way with women
[1:06:50] when they're struggling to try to come
[1:06:52] under the true headship of a true
[1:06:53] servant of God if that means projecting
[1:06:56] to you the right kind of love says then
[1:06:58] finds your place in the Word of God and
[1:07:00] God will help you it will be for your
[1:07:03] good it will be the kind of marriage
[1:07:05] that God wants on the earth just like
[1:07:07] Christ and the church notice this in
[1:07:10] verse 27 that he might present it to
[1:07:14] himself that he might present it to
[1:07:19] himself a glorious church now the word
[1:07:24] glory is a strange word it's the glory
[1:07:26] of God the glory of angels the glory of
[1:07:27] chairman's of glory
[1:07:28] and most of the time it is doctor is the
[1:07:32] word that it comes from but here being

[1:07:38] gorgeously honorable held in good or
[1:07:42] great esteem high repute in lustrous

[1:07:58] the goal of every man that's married to

[1:12:49] her to do forget her father's house sim
[1:12:53] like I remember reading that somewhere
[1:12:54] else in the book of Genesis when he
[1:12:56] called a man by the name of Abram these

[1:14:28] notice the Virgin's the virgins are
[1:14:32] coming because they're given to the
[1:14:36] bride they do not enter on their merit
[1:14:42] they do not interfere coz they deserve
[1:14:45] it they are given to her
[1:14:52] blessed be the Lord over to God
[1:14:58] the Virgin's her companions that follow
[1:15:01] her shall be brought unto thee with

[1:15:16] because of the king's bride but because
[1:15:19] of companionship to his queen instead of
[1:15:24] our fathers shall be thy children whom
[1:15:27] thou miss make princes in all the earth
[1:15:30] I will make thy name to be remembered in
[1:15:34] all generations therefore shall the
[1:15:36] people praise thee for ever and I don't
[1:15:46] want to stagger you but when we get
[1:15:48] there to that City that day they're
[1:15:52] coming to see the city they're coming to
[1:15:55] see the king but they're also coming to
[1:15:59] see you there won't be any jealousy
[1:16:04] there and the kings of the earth that
[1:16:07] live on the outside will pull off a leaf
[1:16:10] and hand to one another on their way out
[1:16:13] it's a think of it brother at one time
[1:16:16] we fought and we killed one another but
[1:16:19] now we're in peace and they won't live
[1:16:22] in the city they'll come up from new
[1:16:24] moon to Sabbath and and all of that but
[1:16:26] they will come up to see the glory of
[1:16:28] the Queen you see it was the custom of
[1:16:32] many of these middle-eastern kings when
[1:16:36] they would show the goal and show their
[1:16:39] armory and show their different things
[1:16:41] but one of their greatest treasures was
[1:16:43] always their life remember when King
[1:16:48] Ahasuerus call for his wife he wanted to
[1:16:54] show her beauty he wanted to show her
[1:16:57] majesty and she refused to come right
[1:17:01] rather sister when God calls for the
[1:17:04] bride amen
[1:17:05] he's calling now the glory the glory is
[1:17:10] preceded by suffering the glory is
[1:17:13] preceded by our identification I
[1:17:16] reproach for the word the reason you'll
[1:17:20] wear this type of glory is because you
[1:17:22] have suffered with them if you suffer
[1:17:24] with him you also shall reign with him
[1:17:29] suffer sister suffer brothers let them
[1:17:32] life at you let them make fun of you you
[1:17:34] will be crowned with the glory in the
[1:17:36] god of heavens
[1:17:38] Oh we'll share his girl in
[1:17:42] personification with you at that day and
[1:17:44] the people will come in and bow before
[1:17:47] you there's the queen let me close again
[1:17:56] verse 27 that he might present it to
[1:17:58] himself a glorious church not having
[1:18:03] spot or wrinkle or any such thing glory
[1:18:11] that it should be holy and without
[1:18:15] blemish it won't have a stain it won't
[1:18:20] have a defect that won't be an impurity
[1:18:23] and there won't be no wrinkles so she's
[1:18:30] an eternal young bride in the rigor of
[1:18:35] this beauty of youth for ever and ever
[1:18:39] oh ma don't you want to take your wife
[1:18:45] by the hand brothers and walk down that
[1:18:48] place together
[1:18:50] and the bloom of eternal yes in the
[1:18:54] presence of the king when he will
[1:18:58] present us to himself praise be to God
[1:19:04] ever son and daughter of God that will
[1:19:06] stand there that day none of us
[1:19:09] 'disformed
[1:19:10] disfigured no gray hairs Oh bald spots
[1:19:14] no age ones among us no one cripples in
[1:19:17] a wheelchair glory to God he will
[1:19:22] present us to himself praise the Lord
[1:19:26] brother Branham well I love my wife then
[1:19:31] yes not like now as a human but it's
[1:19:37] something that's yours
[1:19:38] you see it's something that you stepped
[1:19:41] out of eternity together and a body
[1:19:44] called time and one day you'll step back
[1:19:47] into eternity together again
[1:19:50] hand-in-hand let's stand together notice
[1:19:59] this in verse 28 how that he caps this
[1:20:02] so ought men to love their wives as
[1:20:08] their own bodies you realize how much of
[1:20:16] our squabbling and fussing and all these
[1:20:18] things would be stopped if every man
[1:20:22] would love his wife just according to
[1:20:24] verse 28
[1:20:26] what causes our arguments difference of
[1:20:29] opinion and we're so afraid we got to
[1:20:33] give up a little bit you're gonna give
[1:20:34] up one thing or another you're going to
[1:20:37] give up the last round of words before
[1:20:39] you can say you had the last argument or
[1:20:41] fuss or you're going to exchange it for
[1:20:44] peace I don't care how much you want to
[1:20:47] try to convince me or not you're not
[1:20:48] going to that you can tell me you're
[1:20:51] where you need to be able in your
[1:20:52] fussing and fighting the Holy Ghost does
[1:20:56] not dwell in arguments go ahead I think
[1:21:06] you can I think you can affect I thought
[1:21:08] a good I thought about a colloquy so you
[1:21:15] trade off peace you trade off and drive
[1:21:18] the Holy Ghost out on the limb somewhere
[1:21:20] while you're getting your last word in
[1:21:23] is it really worth it is it really worth
[1:21:28] it so ought men to love their wives as
[1:21:32] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[1:21:37] loveth himself
[1:21:44] don't you understand he's preaching this
[1:21:48] from a divine perspective of the way
[1:21:50] Christ looks at the church he's not
[1:21:55] overwhelmed by you as a Reagan or a Bab
[1:21:57] or a horn that's not why I says turn
[1:22:00] your eyes away from me he's overwhelmed
[1:22:04] by himself in you he looks at you and
[1:22:08] loves you and by so doing he loves his
[1:22:11] own work in your life a man who loves
[1:22:16] his wife and is good to his wife is good
[1:22:19] to himself
[1:22:22] praise the Lord men who put their wives
[1:22:26] to physical abuse there's something
[1:22:28] mentally wrong with them men who put
[1:22:33] their wives through psychological abuse
[1:22:36] arguing fussing i'ma go ahead and say
[1:22:39] they're not in the right mind if they
[1:22:44] were in the right mind this is the way
[1:22:46] they would look at that one
[1:22:47] she don't just serve her brother Donnie
[1:22:49] I understand where you're coming from
[1:22:51] you don't either
[1:22:54] how much grace do you think you deserve
[1:22:58] tell me speak out tell me how much grace
[1:23:03] how much Blair say how much Holy Ghost
[1:23:05] how much forgiveness do you think you
[1:23:06] deserve then why is it then you go to
[1:23:13] him when you make mistakes and ask for
[1:23:15] it and yet you don't think you deserve
[1:23:18] done now you ain't got one standard for
[1:23:22] you and one for your wife do you praise
[1:23:30] God
[1:23:32] the thought is that a man should have
[1:23:35] the same care for his wife as she does
[1:23:38] for his own body
[1:23:41] I fed this thing for almost sixty two
[1:23:45] years now I love it ain't no man in the
[1:23:49] world I love any better now don't stand
[1:23:53] there look at me like a bunch of
[1:23:54] cherubims be honest who do you take care
[1:23:58] of better than anybody else who'd you
[1:24:05] get ready for church your your wife will
[1:24:10] be able to pick her out if you clothed
[1:24:11] her we like what we didn't like to drink
[1:24:18] what we like to eat would like to eat
[1:24:19] when we like to eat what that's her self
[1:24:22] you can imagine then a man loving his
[1:24:25] wife as he loves himself please don't
[1:24:30] misunderstand me friends the Lord God
[1:24:34] loves you more than he loved
[1:24:45] he's simply asking us men to love our
[1:24:48] wives as we love herself but he said
[1:24:52] don't worry I'll go beyond what you can
[1:24:54] even do I love you more than I loved
[1:24:58] myself because I gave to myself for you
[1:25:04] I can follow a man like that what about
[1:25:14] it brothers can we follow this example
[1:25:17] can we be this kind of man or we want to
[1:25:20] be men by mouth I'll tell your brother
[1:25:23] Donny I can benchpress I don't care if
[1:25:26] you can lift a thousand pounds in each
[1:25:28] arm I don't care if you can benchpress
[1:25:31] 789 pounds with your little toe that
[1:25:34] don't make you a man right here's what
[1:25:39] makes you a man
[1:25:41] this is a man after God's own heart well
[1:25:51] I'm getting old enough to retire I guess
[1:25:53] I'm retired after this tonight if y'all
[1:25:54] want me to be dangerous grim that
[1:26:00] election tonight wouldn't it
[1:26:03] let's bow our heads together shall we
[1:26:13] Lord Jesus help us father how can we
[1:26:22] fathom such love it's love beyond our
[1:26:27] human understanding it's love that is so
[1:26:31] great Lord Jesus I pray that should help
[1:26:37] each of us men women boys girls the
[1:26:44] married the single the divorced
[1:26:47] all of us love God to have this kind of
[1:26:52] undying unselfish love help us men that
[1:27:01] are married that have wives to take
[1:27:05] these scriptures there's a very great
[1:27:10] command directly from the Lord Jesus to
[1:27:14] us O God may we meditate on them and may
[1:27:21] we set them before us maybe there's men
[1:27:24] here tonight who can honestly say they
[1:27:26] can't do this that they really don't
[1:27:28] love their wife as their self maybe they
[1:27:33] say I'm just struggling with it don't
[1:27:35] I've got to be honest well don't we know
[1:27:37] that you want us to be honest before you
[1:27:40] it would be unjust of you Lord to make
[1:27:44] such a demand of us men unless you would
[1:27:47] empower us to fulfill it
[1:27:50] but we know it's a Holy Ghost in our
[1:27:52] souls and submission of our flesh Lord
[1:27:58] God we can become this what you want us
[1:28:01] to be many of these married man will
[1:28:04] never be preachers they'll never
[1:28:06] interpret tongues many of them probably
[1:28:08] have never even spoken in tongues here's
[1:28:12] what they can't be why should they spend
[1:28:15] years of their life focusing on
[1:28:16] something they're not even called to be
[1:28:18] and ignoring something they're called to
[1:28:21] be every day of their life Lord this is
[1:28:26] not trivial this is not small this is a
[1:28:30] very great demand of us men as it is of
[1:28:34] the sisters then lord I pray you would
[1:28:38] help us is true men we have several
[1:28:42] couples getting married in the next few
[1:28:44] months six weddings maybe something like
[1:28:47] that
[1:28:47] I pray it helped these young men
[1:28:51] standing present tonight Lord to realize
[1:28:55] what an awesome responsibility that are
[1:28:58] entering to help these young ladies Lord
[1:29:02] what a great great union it is so much
[1:29:06] that you typed you and your church like
[1:29:08] this god help us uh pray help us men to
[1:29:15] give all that we are put you first and
[1:29:19] foremost secondly after that love our
[1:29:24] wives oh I know Lord many have it
[1:29:29] backwards
[1:29:30] they love their children more than their
[1:29:32] life they die for their children they
[1:29:34] put their children first they do this
[1:29:36] and this and this for the children and
[1:29:39] then when the children leave home their
[1:29:41] marriage collapses and they wonder why
[1:29:45] but you had it right in the Garden of
[1:29:48] Eden you didn't put Adam and a boy you
[1:29:51] didn't put Adam and three sons or how
[1:29:53] many of our sons or daughters you put a
[1:29:56] man
[1:29:57] and his wife and you gave them time
[1:30:00] together which a married couple need to
[1:30:03] bond together to form a true bond before
[1:30:07] children start coming because once they
[1:30:08] do it'll change then you gave children
[1:30:12] after the Union that's the perfect order
[1:30:16] then you expect us to keep it in that
[1:30:20] order it's more difficult when children
[1:30:23] come along the mothers attention the
[1:30:25] father's attention but you never
[1:30:27] intended for the marriage to erode
[1:30:29] because children come on the scene takes
[1:30:33] more work more devotion to make it work
[1:30:37] but it can work and work successfully
[1:30:40] help us Lord Jesus you know my prayer
[1:30:45] father one day I want to stand before

[1:40:02] thank you for your word thank you for
[1:40:06] the Blessed opportunity to be closed all
[1:40:12] Lamb of God as we trod just last week
[1:40:20] last Wednesday oh my father as my eyes
[1:40:27] looked upon the Old City of Jerusalem
[1:40:33] built by the Turks 500 years ago as we
[1:40:39] come from the South and went to the
[1:40:41] north and those who know the geography
[1:40:44] of theirs are knowing that it's far as
[1:40:47] the land mass about the size of the
[1:40:50] state of New Jersey and there's places
[1:40:55] in America that's much more beautiful
[1:40:58] places in Europe that's more beautiful
[1:41:02] but yet according to your word the book
[1:41:05] of Deuteronomy you talked about that
[1:41:08] land to the children of Israel and you
[1:41:09] said it's a land that the Lord our God
[1:41:12] loveth and his eyes our opponent from
[1:41:18] the beginning of the year to the end of
[1:41:20] the year it's a land which drinketh in
[1:41:24] the rain it is a land that you will not
[1:41:28] water with your foot which is speaking
[1:41:32] of the irrigation of Egypt that they by
[1:41:35] their feet would kick the water wheels
[1:41:37] and water the land or glory and I
[1:41:43] thought when I looked at the land and
[1:41:45] some of it's so barren and so desolate
[1:41:48] nothing growing it helped me to see how
[1:41:53] that God's vision is so different from
[1:41:55] ours as you look at that land and you
[1:41:59] said it was beautiful and you said it
[1:42:00] was all these great adjectives and yet
[1:42:03] even to this very day on some of it
[1:42:05] nothing grows but it shows your vision
[1:42:09] of that land glory to God of what it's
[1:42:12] going to be one day and I thought of us
[1:42:15] we may look barren sometimes we may look
[1:42:18] dry and you look at us and say thou art
[1:42:22] beautiful as tearsa comely as Jerusalem
[1:42:27] praise be to God we worship You Lord
[1:42:32] Jesus make us beautiful in your house I
[1:42:36] pray Lord God hallelujah we worship You
