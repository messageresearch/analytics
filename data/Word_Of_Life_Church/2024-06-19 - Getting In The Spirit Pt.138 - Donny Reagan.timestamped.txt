[46:31] together in Revelation 5:
[46:35] 7 question answers tomorrow night Lord
[46:38] willing so those of you that want to
[46:41] come those of you that want to stream
[46:42] will'll be streaming it also I'll need
[46:45] your prayers I'll be speaking Lord
[46:47] willing tonight and then tomorrow night
[46:48] then I've got got to be with brother
[46:50] Josh spett on Friday night be coming
[46:52] back um for church on Sunday Lord Willie
[46:56] we're so glad to have the pastor's wife
[46:58] back with us
[47:05] tonight so if you tried to speak to her
[47:07] before church and she didn't answer you
[47:09] she's not stuck up she just can't hardly
[47:12] talk yet so she still needs your prayers
[47:15] she still got stitches in and went
[47:17] yesterday to the doctor and he said they
[47:19] wasn't quite ready to take them out so
[47:21] just remember that the Lord will just
[47:23] continue to bring healing in her body
[47:26] brother Revelation 5:
[47:29] 7 he came and took the book out of the
[47:32] right hand that hand of him that sat
[47:34] upon the
[47:35] throne when he had taken the book The
[47:38] Four beasts and the 4 and 20 Elders fell
[47:42] down before the lamb having every one of
[47:46] them Harps and golden vials full of
[47:51] oders which are the prayers of the
[47:54] Saints and they sung
[47:57] a new song they
[48:00] sung a new song it's amazing to me how
[48:04] that events on the earth can so move
[48:07] Heaven that it changes the songs that
[48:11] they
[48:13] sing I don't know exactly what our
[48:16] brothers and sisters husbands wives
[48:18] children I don't know exactly what they
[48:23] know how much the Lord allows them to
[48:26] see
[48:27] and that sixth
[48:29] Dimension but I do know from the dreams
[48:32] that brother brandham
[48:33] had his
[48:36] daughter mentions about his Morris chair
[48:40] for those of you that don't remember
[48:41] what that is it was a chair that they
[48:45] repossessed and she told him that his
[48:47] chair was
[48:49] there when he dreamed about his wife he
[48:52] dreamed about how sad and seeing her and
[48:55] she said I know Bill I
[48:58] know I don't know exactly what God
[49:00] allows him to see but I do know our
[49:04] actions here are so correlated with
[49:07] what's going up in there they sung a new
[49:10] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[49:13] book and to open the seals
[49:15] thereof for thou was slain and Hast
[49:19] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[49:22] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[49:30] Nation so it's easy to see about this
[49:34] passage of scripture that these are not
[49:36] just
[49:37] Jews Jews would never have said that so
[49:42] what is this
[49:44] Gentiles a diverse people a bride called
[49:49] out of every Kindred tongue people and
[49:53] nation which the Jews still have a hard
[49:56] time understanding of course and has
[49:58] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[50:03] and we shall reign on the earth how many
[50:07] like to be remembered tonight as we pray
[50:09] God bless
[50:10] you this whole our request in her heart
[50:14] remember brother Josh's meeting as I
[50:17] mentioned coming up this week and also
[50:19] Lord willing our our meeting will begin
[50:21] next week and we're looking forward to
[50:23] that time brother Matt Watkins will be
[50:26] speaking on Friday night brother Daryl
[50:28] on Saturday and Brother David Siler on
[50:31] Sunday morning and we're just looking
[50:33] forward to a great time in the Lord
[50:36] let's pray together Lord Jesus it is
[50:39] such an honor again for us to be
[50:41] gathered together here how we love
[50:43] Wednesday night just so grateful that we
[50:47] can be able to have church on
[50:49] Wednesday lord it's such an
[50:51] encouragement to us such a boost during
[50:54] the middle of the week and we're just so
[50:56] happy happy to be gathered in the house
[50:58] of God I pray tonight Lord that you
[51:01] would take your word and speak to us you
[51:04] know exactly what we have need of father
[51:08] I know that many people and our our
[51:10] church family here are dealing with
[51:12] different things in their bodies in
[51:14] their homes maybe in their home life we
[51:18] believe that you're mindful Lord being
[51:20] in contact with people all over the
[51:23] world it seems that there are so many
[51:26] things
[51:27] that your children are dealing with but
[51:30] we believe if we look at it right these
[51:32] things that we face can be opportunities
[51:36] of Faith by which you can Channel your
[51:39] Supernatural power in our Direction so I
[51:42] pray that you'd help us to look at it in
[51:44] that way we need you tonight Lord once
[51:47] again to take the word and break it to
[51:51] our hearts May our hearts be fertile
[51:53] ground that we can be able to receive it
[51:55] in seed form
[51:57] May the spirit of God Quicken it then
[51:59] that it'll mature into what you desire
[52:01] it to produce you see the meetings
[52:04] coming up this week next week Lord
[52:07] Brother Ander Glover Just Landing a few
[52:09] hours ago he text me and just landed in
[52:13] Australia got some meetings there so
[52:16] lots of meetings going on in the
[52:17] summertime and we pray that You' just be
[52:19] mindful of all the camps and things like
[52:21] that lord of the needs of your people
[52:24] for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:26] that we ask it amen God bless you you
[52:30] may be
[52:35] seated I realize that there
[52:39] are an element of people in
[52:43] Christendom that sees no
[52:46] significance about talking about the
[52:49] seals preaching about them or even
[52:53] trying to understand them
[52:57] I find that very sad myself but I also
[53:01] realize there's an element of people
[53:04] around our own
[53:06] message preachers that don't really
[53:09] preach on the seals they don't study
[53:11] them they don't understand them and it's
[53:15] as if though they have no desire to
[53:18] understand them because somehow they
[53:21] have a
[53:22] disconnect of the value and the
[53:25] importance of what the seals are so they
[53:29] think well we preach the cross we preach
[53:31] the blood we preach forgiveness we
[53:33] preach miracles signs wonders so what do
[53:37] we need the seals for but I believe from
[53:42] the scriptures that we've read tonight
[53:44] plus the other scriptures of course um
[53:48] that the seals play such an important
[53:51] part in the plan of God in the capping
[53:55] part of of the work of Calvary the
[53:58] sealing of the individual and the
[54:01] breaking of the seal on the individual's
[54:04] life and then the breaking of the seals
[54:07] in the church ages and then in the end
[54:09] time the seals being broken to help us
[54:13] to see our position and who we are I
[54:17] don't know it makes me wonder sometimes
[54:20] if people have ever really run across
[54:24] some of the statements that I'd like to
[54:26] to share with you right now I I think if
[54:29] they did it would help them to see more
[54:33] of a value listen to this in the rising
[54:35] of the sun he is the one who opened
[54:40] those
[54:41] seals
[54:42] he
[54:45] is those
[54:48] seals oh my goodness so the Lord
[54:52] Jesus the lamb
[54:56] is the
[54:58] seals so if we don't think the seals
[55:02] have any importance and any
[55:06] value we are saying that this part of
[55:11] Christ has no
[55:14] value so if we would do the same thing
[55:17] to Healing miracles
[55:21] signs and we realize that some of the
[55:24] message are so against all of that
[55:27] aspect of God some major on it some
[55:30] don't even minor on it but to me if it's
[55:35] part of God I want
[55:38] it I want to get it in its right place
[55:40] of course but if the Lord Jesus suffered
[55:44] stripes for our healing why wouldn't we
[55:48] want to be healed sure go to your doctor
[55:51] do all of that but when your doctor does
[55:53] everything that he can do for you he
[55:55] still canot heal you only the Lord Jesus
[55:58] is your
[55:59] healer so I look at the word of God in
[56:02] every aspect of that word and if it is
[56:06] revealing a further part of the
[56:09] personage of the Lord Jesus I want to
[56:13] understand that I want to be able to I
[56:15] may not understand it as great as other
[56:17] men do but I want to understand whatever
[56:20] God will let me and my capacity
[56:23] understand I mean understands that for
[56:25] yourself you want to be exactly what God
[56:28] wants you to be now he says he is the
[56:31] one who opened those seals he is those
[56:36] seals for the whole word of God is
[56:42] Christ so the whole word of God is
[56:47] Christ so preaching the cross is Christ
[56:52] preaching on the baptism of the Holy
[56:53] Ghost that's Christ and yet there's
[56:56] millions of people who profess
[56:59] Christianity Today that don't even
[57:02] believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:06] I'm convinced friends I know you've
[57:08] heard me say it for years I'm convinced
[57:10] with all of my heart it's one of the
[57:13] greatest lacks in our message is that
[57:17] people have never had a Pentecostal
[57:21] experience I'll be dealing with it a
[57:23] little little bit Lord willing tomorrow
[57:24] night with one of the questions that's
[57:26] been asked and I'll go ahead and say it
[57:28] tonight I really believe that some of
[57:30] the message preachers the reason they
[57:33] fight emotion so much and the reason
[57:38] they fight us following the spirit of
[57:41] God and the spirit of God moving and so
[57:44] on in the services is because many of
[57:47] them that do that have never had a
[57:50] Pentecostal experience
[57:52] themsel if you ever have a true G genine
[57:57] acts two I ain't talking about isus
[57:59] Street an Acts 2 experience with God
[58:03] You' want everybody and their brother to
[58:05] have it come on you want your children
[58:08] to have it you'll want your
[58:09] grandchildren to have it you'd want your
[58:11] greatest enemy to have it because if
[58:13] they get it they won't be your enemy no
[58:16] more you would want everybody to
[58:19] experience that thing that you have had
[58:22] I mean you find people over and over and
[58:25] over again and they're preaching against
[58:28] emotion their all of their quotes are
[58:30] against emotion and it's as if though
[58:33] why why are they riding that horse over
[58:36] and over again and yet they thems
[58:39] themselves cry all the
[58:43] time and you saying du crying is an
[58:49] emotion as a matter of fact the prophet
[58:52] tells us in the church AE book that of
[58:54] all the human
[58:56] emotions the one the Lord Jesus
[59:00] expressed the most was
[59:03] crying I'm glad God did not make us as
[59:08] humans without
[59:11] emotions well come on somebody you
[59:14] imagine what would be if we didn't have
[59:17] emotions so our children tap into our
[59:21] emotions our grandchildren tap into our
[59:24] emotions sporting event whatever you
[59:27] enjoy doing they tap into your emotions
[59:30] so if you let everything else have them
[59:33] emotions why not let the Lord Jesus have
[59:36] them I don't understand why I would not
[59:40] want to give him my tears my joy my
[59:43] hands my feet everything about me my why
[59:47] would I want to give it to the world and
[59:49] not give it to the Lord Jesus
[59:52] himself I think he deserves everything
[59:55] that I am don't you you so he he wants
[59:58] our emotion he wants our joy he wants us
[1:00:02] to so feel you imagine when he goes to
[1:00:04] the tomb of Lazarus in St John 11 and
[1:00:08] that experience tapped in not only to
[1:00:12] the faith of God in the Lord Jesus but
[1:00:14] the Lord Jesus allowed himself to
[1:00:18] express several emotions at the grave of
[1:00:23] Lazarus and the first notable one was
[1:00:26] that Jesus wept so the the grave and the
[1:00:31] death of Lazarus tapped into the very
[1:00:34] Humanity of the Lord Jesus and he
[1:00:36] allowed himself to cry but that was not
[1:00:39] the only emotion that he did because he
[1:00:42] cried out with a loud voice so you see
[1:00:46] crying out with a loud voice I know some
[1:00:49] people the only way they know how to
[1:00:51] worship God is be
[1:00:54] still and know
[1:00:56] that I am
[1:01:00] God God speaks in a
[1:01:04] still
[1:01:06] small
[1:01:09] voice but God also
[1:01:14] Thunders come on Christ is that
[1:01:18] scripture about the still small voice
[1:01:21] but Christ is also them thunders of
[1:01:24] Revelation 10 so if we preach only the
[1:01:27] loud Thunders and we don't preach the
[1:01:30] still Small Voice we're still not
[1:01:32] preaching all the attributes of Christ
[1:01:34] and reverse part if we preach only the
[1:01:37] still Small Voice and we don't preach
[1:01:39] the shouting the running the screaming
[1:01:42] we're still leaving out that part of
[1:01:44] Christ I love the quotes an invisible
[1:01:47] Union when brother brandom talks about
[1:01:50] them acts
[1:01:52] 238 screaming hollering
[1:01:56] speaking youngans I realize there's some
[1:01:59] message folks they cringe when those
[1:02:02] quotes are read why because they do not
[1:02:06] believe them it does not go along with
[1:02:09] their emotions but a real child of God
[1:02:12] that has the Holy Ghost they don't just
[1:02:14] say Amen to their favorite quotes they
[1:02:18] say Amen to those that burn their hides
[1:02:21] they don't just say Amen to their
[1:02:23] favorite scriptures but the Holy Ghost s
[1:02:26] them will say Amen to those and I mean
[1:02:28] turn them up one side and down the other
[1:02:31] cuz it ain't just you saying amen it
[1:02:33] ain't just me saying amen it's the Holy
[1:02:36] Ghost in us saying amen amen amen is
[1:02:41] that right you know once we realize that
[1:02:45] that the word the whole word is Christ
[1:02:49] so if Christ Jesus is the seals then
[1:02:53] there must be some great value and and
[1:02:56] looking at these seals now notice he
[1:02:58] said the whole word of God is Christ and
[1:03:01] Christ is the
[1:03:03] seals that was open what is the opening
[1:03:08] of the seals then
[1:03:11] revealing Christ so the opening of the
[1:03:15] seals is revealing Christ why would not
[1:03:19] we as a church want to know what all
[1:03:22] that
[1:03:24] contains notice and even the very seven
[1:03:27] angels which represented the seven
[1:03:30] churches now notice the seven angels
[1:03:34] which represented the seven churches all
[1:03:38] completed we couldn't even see it they
[1:03:41] did they took the picture not us they
[1:03:46] took the picture who science do you
[1:03:50] think the scientific magazine and Life
[1:03:53] Magazine would have ever put that
[1:03:55] picture of the cloud in there if one of
[1:03:58] the message followers took that picture
[1:04:01] do you think they would have put it in
[1:04:03] there if brother brandham would have had
[1:04:05] a camera out there he and Fred sofman
[1:04:09] and the other believers and they would
[1:04:11] have took a picture of that and they
[1:04:13] would have sent it to the Science
[1:04:15] magazine or Life Magazine do youth s
[1:04:18] Life Magazine would have posted that
[1:04:22] picture but how did God do it God let
[1:04:27] the scientists themselves God let
[1:04:30] several people again if God would have
[1:04:34] allowed some of brother brenham's team
[1:04:36] in 1950 in Houston Texas in the same
[1:04:40] Houston Coliseum and Billy Paul would
[1:04:43] have run out with a camera and snap
[1:04:45] pictures of the pillar of fire and and
[1:04:47] then some other brother and some other
[1:04:49] believer and some shouting Holy Roller
[1:04:51] Pentecostal preacher do you think that
[1:04:54] picture would still be in the Library of
[1:04:56] Congress and oh yes it's still there I
[1:05:00] was there a few years ago in Washington
[1:05:02] DC brother Mike walls took us there he's
[1:05:05] took people there from around the world
[1:05:08] when they go in asking about it they've
[1:05:10] got to where now they know where they
[1:05:12] want so they say you want the cloud
[1:05:14] picture it's in drawer so and so and
[1:05:16] file so and so we have helped make it
[1:05:19] famous because it means so much to the
[1:05:22] bride of Christ because we don't just
[1:05:25] see brother brandom in that we see the
[1:05:28] Lord
[1:05:30] Jesus well praise the Lord I don't just
[1:05:33] see brother Bram it was quite an honor
[1:05:35] for me to be able to reach down in there
[1:05:37] and pick that up you have to put gloves
[1:05:39] on and all that thing you know but it
[1:05:41] was quite an honor Carol and I stood
[1:05:43] there and the other believers that was
[1:05:45] there to be able to hold it in your hand
[1:05:48] and realized I am part of that not only
[1:05:52] that but a part of what was on that
[1:05:54] picture with was in my soul when I was
[1:05:57] standing there holding it that same
[1:05:59] Pillar of Fire that same Lord Jesus is
[1:06:02] my master I'm not just a part of a
[1:06:05] picture I'm a part of a move come on
[1:06:09] Saints this is more than just a about a
[1:06:12] picture oh they can call us whatever
[1:06:14] they wish to but we are identified and
[1:06:17] we're not serving a god of yesterday but
[1:06:20] a Christ who is the same yesterday today
[1:06:24] and forever Now watch how he goes into
[1:06:27] this he said they took the picture not
[1:06:29] us and there he is standing there
[1:06:32] Supreme judge showing that he is Alpha
[1:06:36] and Omega the beginning and the end what
[1:06:40] identification so the seals in is more
[1:06:44] than just well a white horse rider and a
[1:06:46] red horse rider and a black what's the
[1:06:49] big deal brother D the big deal is it's
[1:06:52] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:06:56] so in the seals is going to open up
[1:06:59] something further of your inheritance
[1:07:02] and it's not just talking about the
[1:07:04] Millennium it's not just talking about
[1:07:06] the resurrection and the change of the
[1:07:08] body but it has to do with things we
[1:07:11] need right now in this present life is
[1:07:14] there people here tonight that need
[1:07:16] healing are there anybody here that
[1:07:17] needs encouragement anybody here that
[1:07:19] needs a little more joy a little more
[1:07:22] happiness need a financial move look at
[1:07:24] all the hands in here tonight then you
[1:07:26] wonder how many more there's out there
[1:07:27] that stream it well the seals is to
[1:07:30] loose your inheritance and help you to
[1:07:33] see who you are in order to do that it
[1:07:36] will have to be a supernatural anointing
[1:07:40] that will help us to be released also to
[1:07:43] match our identity now watch this in the
[1:07:46] breach but now in this seven seal
[1:07:50] Sevenfold book of seals of redemption
[1:07:53] that the lamb took
[1:07:56] within himself I want you to notice what
[1:07:59] he does the lamb takes the book from
[1:08:02] Spirit God in the symbolism he takes the
[1:08:06] book and he takes that book
[1:08:09] into himself so he pulls it into his
[1:08:14] being now the seven seal book of seals
[1:08:18] the Redemption the lamb takes within
[1:08:21] himself was the only one that could to
[1:08:24] it so he took it from from the right
[1:08:26] hand of him that sat upon the throne to
[1:08:29] claim his Redemptive to claim his rights
[1:08:33] to claim for me and you what he redeemed
[1:08:38] us from so it has to do with now it has
[1:08:42] to do with tomorrow it has to do with
[1:08:45] next week it has to do with your
[1:08:48] Resurrection it has to do with your
[1:08:50] rapture it has to do with your
[1:08:52] Millennium it has to do with your eight
[1:08:55] day this is who you are as a group of
[1:09:00] Believers notice he said he come to
[1:09:03] redeem us back to everything that Adam
[1:09:07] Lost In the Garden of Eden he has
[1:09:10] redeemed us back to that now who are
[1:09:14] those that are going to be in the full
[1:09:17] scale of redemption redeem means of
[1:09:20] course to buy back so if I went into a
[1:09:23] pawn shop and I saw a RI nail gun there

[1:10:42] here neither I ain't look for no jing
[1:10:44] jong juu and no haa cha and no we wo wo
[1:10:48] I like to have some Holy Ghost filled
[1:10:50] baptized Sanctified children of God
[1:10:53] whose names are on the Lambs Book of
[1:10:55] Life they're not scared of the devil
[1:10:58] they're not scared of death they're not
[1:11:00] scared of sickness they're not scared of
[1:11:02] evil because they have found their name
[1:11:05] and it ain't Wing Wong word but they
[1:11:07] found their word name in the word of God
[1:11:10] and they're willing to stand up and
[1:11:12] fight for what is rightfully
[1:11:18] ours so only redeemable people will ever
[1:11:23] acquire to this notice in the Harvest
[1:11:26] Time the book of redemption he redeemed
[1:11:29] all that was in that book not out of the
[1:11:34] book now remember the foolish virgin or
[1:11:36] now than that Lamb's Book of Life nor
[1:11:38] are those others outside of there but
[1:11:42] the book of redemption contains the name
[1:11:45] of the redeemable anything that had a
[1:11:48] beginning has an end but if you've got
[1:11:51] eternal life you never did begin and you
[1:11:55] you cannot end because your sons and
[1:11:59] daughters of God attributes of his
[1:12:02] thoughts and his word you have no ending
[1:12:05] of life if your name is on that book The
[1:12:09] Lamb came to redeem it not all that
[1:12:12] profess Christians not all that try to
[1:12:15] live good and holy but those whose names
[1:12:19] were written on there praise God he
[1:12:22] redeemed that and that alone whose names
[1:12:26] are on the book now how long will it
[1:12:29] take it will take until the last one is
[1:12:33] redeemed on that book aren't you glad
[1:12:35] that might have been you or I so it will
[1:12:38] take exactly that long that God
[1:12:40] dispersed his seed from the very
[1:12:43] beginning down to the ages there might
[1:12:44] be 500 it might be 5,000 we don't know
[1:12:47] but when that last one whose name is on
[1:12:50] that book notice he said the lamb in the
[1:12:53] time of intercessory back there he knew
[1:12:55] knew that there were names in there that
[1:12:57] was put in from the foundation of the
[1:12:59] world and as long as them names have
[1:13:01] never been
[1:13:03] manifested on Earth so think now you
[1:13:07] have got to manifest a name as long as
[1:13:11] those names are not manifested on earth
[1:13:16] oh Hallelujah never been manifested on
[1:13:18] Earth he had to stay there as
[1:13:22] intercessor do you get it perfectly
[1:13:24] pretty predestination all right he had
[1:13:26] to stay there because he came to die for
[1:13:29] those that God had ordained to eternal
[1:13:32] life see by his for knowledge he saw
[1:13:36] them not by his own will his will was
[1:13:39] that none should perish but by his forn
[1:13:42] knowledge he knew who would and who
[1:13:45] would not therefore as long as there is
[1:13:47] one name that had never yet been
[1:13:50] declared on Earth Christ had to stay
[1:13:53] there as an intercessor
[1:13:55] to take care of that name you see when
[1:14:00] he starts take caring taking care of
[1:14:02] that name in heaven the human respondant
[1:14:06] on the earth will automatically start
[1:14:08] feeling a draw so when the Christ the
[1:14:11] lamb goes toward that name on the book
[1:14:14] surely friends we must be on the last
[1:14:17] page we must be on the latter part of
[1:14:20] that book and them last ones are there
[1:14:22] and when the hand of God starts moving
[1:14:25] toward that last's name as it were to
[1:14:28] manifest that name on the earth no
[1:14:30] matter what color they are what race
[1:14:33] they are what continent they live are
[1:14:35] there'll be something that'll sweep over
[1:14:37] that little eagle and start pulling them
[1:14:39] toward the Throne of God they might have
[1:14:41] said I don't believe in God I don't want
[1:14:44] to go to church I don't want nothing to
[1:14:46] do with God but all of a sudden
[1:14:48] something will move on them like it did
[1:14:50] on you do you think it was you making up
[1:14:53] your mind it wasn't you making up your
[1:14:55] mind the lamb approached your name on
[1:14:59] the book Hallelujah the lamb started
[1:15:02] moving toward your name on the book and
[1:15:06] whatever day that was that was the time
[1:15:09] that you were to come to him because the
[1:15:12] manifestation of your name demanded that
[1:15:15] you come into that sphere with
[1:15:18] God Oh Glory but as soon as that final
[1:15:22] name has been splashed
[1:15:26] splashed in that Clorox are bleached and
[1:15:29] the intercessory Days Are Over let him
[1:15:31] that's filthy be filthy still let him
[1:15:33] that's holy be holy still he leaves the
[1:15:37] sanctuary and when it becomes a judgment
[1:15:40] seat woe to those outside of Christ then
[1:15:43] again souls in prison when that last
[1:15:46] name on that book was redeemed the lamb
[1:15:49] came forth and took the book I'm the one
[1:15:52] that did it he says but when God takes
[1:15:55] that last name and redeems it from The
[1:15:59] Book of Life That's all of it there
[1:16:02] can't be no more anyhow when the LI name
[1:16:05] comes out that was put on the Lamb's
[1:16:08] Book of Life that was slain from the
[1:16:09] foundation of the world when that life's
[1:16:12] name has been redeemed his work is
[1:16:16] finished he comes forth to claim what is
[1:16:19] redeemed that's what makes a heart bleed
[1:16:21] but if it went on a thousand years later
[1:16:25] that would not be even
[1:16:30] one take of years ago I remember as a
[1:16:34] boy in Pentecost hearing him singing
[1:16:37] wait a little
[1:16:38] longer please
[1:16:41] Jesus a few more days to get our loved
[1:16:45] ones in oh wait a little
[1:16:49] longer that was the understanding that I
[1:16:51] was raised
[1:16:53] in but you realize he will not lose or
[1:16:59] one oh my then Redemption will be over
[1:17:04] as far as making up the Gentile bride
[1:17:07] and what will happen now listen friends
[1:17:09] make sure that you understand that God
[1:17:11] in this time before it's done God is
[1:17:14] still reaching out Mercy to those
[1:17:17] foolish virgins that can be saved if the
[1:17:20] spirit of God moves upon their hearts oh
[1:17:23] you say but brother Donnie what if they
[1:17:24] don't believe the message many of them
[1:17:26] are not ordained to believe this message
[1:17:28] but I'll tell you one thing I would
[1:17:30] rather sit around a church even if it
[1:17:32] was a message Church I'd rather be under
[1:17:35] that canopy of protection I believe my
[1:17:38] name is there I believe with all of my
[1:17:40] heart it is but I'm going to serve him
[1:17:43] if my name ain't there if the Rapture
[1:17:46] takes place and I'm left here behind
[1:17:48] I've still have had a glorious life
[1:17:50] serving almighty God I'm not serving him
[1:17:53] because I want toap escape this world
[1:17:55] I'm not serving him because I'm hoping
[1:17:58] I'm bride I'm serving him because I love
[1:18:01] him if he cast me away at the end of the
[1:18:04] way I'd still rather live for him than I
[1:18:07] would for the Devil the devil ain't got
[1:18:09] no love for me the devil ain't never
[1:18:11] been kind to me he ain't never been kind
[1:18:14] to you but Jesus has been so good and so
[1:18:17] wonderful and so awesome and that's the
[1:18:20] reason I don't think that I'll ever be
[1:18:21] lost because loving him the way I do I
[1:18:24] just can't see myself as not being a
[1:18:27] part of that bride but if I looked up
[1:18:29] there and my name wasn't there I'd say
[1:18:31] that's fine Lord I'd still serve you I'd
[1:18:34] still pre well you say boy if I knew
[1:18:36] that I I'd go out there and live like
[1:18:38] the world that shows you don't love him
[1:18:40] right if you love him right and he
[1:18:42] throwed you away at the end of the way
[1:18:44] you'd still say blessed be the name of
[1:18:46] the Lord the Lord is good the Lord is
[1:18:49] righteous he gave me more than I
[1:18:51] deserved
[1:18:53] anyhow but when I name is redeemed the
[1:18:55] Lambs take the book and walks away
[1:18:57] that's all Redemption is over it's
[1:19:00] closed that last name goes on the book
[1:19:02] or the last name that's redeemed that
[1:19:03] was put on the book that settles it
[1:19:05] can't you see friend it won't make any
[1:19:07] difference how far it goes and how much
[1:19:10] people think they're getting saved you
[1:19:12] see we have to be in that quickening as
[1:19:14] it was in the beginning Brothers just
[1:19:17] jump down there to Ruth chapter 4 verse
[1:19:19] 11 now remember the parallel between
[1:19:22] Boaz and Ruth is an exact anot type uh
[1:19:25] between Christ and the Gentile bride
[1:19:27] notice what happens now whenever he
[1:19:30] returns and we're back at the gate and
[1:19:32] all the people that were in the gate
[1:19:35] were back at the Gate of of the city of
[1:19:38] his inheritance all the people that were
[1:19:40] in the gate and the elders said we Are
[1:19:45] Witnesses we Are Witnesses the Lord make
[1:19:50] the woman that is come into thine house
[1:19:53] like Rachel
[1:19:55] and like Leah which too did build the
[1:20:00] house of Israel which is a very peculiar
[1:20:05] statement which two did build the house
[1:20:08] of
[1:20:09] Israel Rachel and
[1:20:12] Leah well I thought it would have been
[1:20:17] Sarah
[1:20:19] Rebeca but Rachel and
[1:20:22] Leah Glory
[1:20:25] which too did build the house of Israel
[1:20:27] now notice what they are saying the
[1:20:30] Witnesses are saying about Ruth let
[1:20:36] Ruth build the house of
[1:20:42] Israel do thou
[1:20:46] worthily end
[1:20:49] Ephrata and be
[1:20:52] famous and Beth
[1:20:55] him what wonderful changes has now
[1:20:58] happened to Ruth's life because she
[1:21:01] trusted Boaz and let him work on her
[1:21:06] behalf now remember while this whole
[1:21:08] thing has been going on at the gate
[1:21:09] she's still back out at Naomi's house
[1:21:11] waiting she don't even know the outcome
[1:21:14] of all this yet prophecy is being spoke
[1:21:17] over her her Destiny has been made
[1:21:20] manifest and she's back there Sweating
[1:21:22] Bullets as we'd say she don't even know
[1:21:25] yet the outcome because he is at the
[1:21:29] gate Oh Glory to God he is at the gate
[1:21:32] and the Witnesses in the gate are
[1:21:36] speaking about her when she still down
[1:21:39] at the house don't you understand
[1:21:40] whatever we read this setting of
[1:21:42] Revelation 5 and those witnesses that
[1:21:44] have already died and got on in the
[1:21:46] presence of the Lord and the other ones
[1:21:48] are on the earth and they're up there
[1:21:50] singing about what we're just breaking
[1:21:51] into they're singing and rejoicing you
[1:21:54] are worthy and you made us Kings and
[1:21:56] Priests and our Gods we're still down
[1:21:58] here fighting Devils we're fighting
[1:22:00] sickness we're fighting trouble we're
[1:22:01] going through all these things and
[1:22:03] they're up there shouting and rejoicing
[1:22:05] and saying glory to God Rose glory to
[1:22:07] God Rose you've made it because of your
[1:22:09] Perfection you're going to cause a
[1:22:11] resurrection because of your completion
[1:22:14] you're going to wind up causing the body
[1:22:15] change Ruth and Ruth is still down there
[1:22:18] sweat and and I wonder how it's going I
[1:22:20] wonder what's going on up there in the
[1:22:22] gate I wonder if to got me or I wonder
[1:22:24] Boaz got me she ain't still sure am I do
[1:22:27] I belong to Boaz or do I belong to toad
[1:22:30] God wrote her name with Boaz before the
[1:22:32] foundation of the world God wrote your
[1:22:35] name was Christ Jesus before the
[1:22:37] foundation of the world but sometimes he
[1:22:39] lets us set in the house and we're
[1:22:41] sweating and we're threaten and we're
[1:22:42] worried but if we could just be
[1:22:44] identified and what we believe
[1:22:46] recognizes that's something in our soul
[1:22:49] we say Lord I've got to be a part of
[1:22:51] that Resurrection I've got to be a part
[1:22:53] of this word something down in me
[1:22:55] identifies me with this
[1:22:57] word notice so she's trusting Boaz huh
[1:23:02] look at the contrast now so she moves
[1:23:06] from
[1:23:07] loneliness to
[1:23:09] love she moves from reproach to
[1:23:14] acceptance she moves from being a beggar
[1:23:18] to being a great great mother in the
[1:23:21] lineage of the Lord God she moov moves
[1:23:24] from toil to rest she moves from
[1:23:29] rejection to absolutely being accepted
[1:23:33] by not only Boaz but of the people now
[1:23:35] remember these people would have been
[1:23:38] some of the same ones when she first
[1:23:39] come in that would have rejected her and
[1:23:42] turned her down and God's turning right
[1:23:44] around and making them people prophesy
[1:23:47] of her Destiny she moves from poverty to
[1:23:51] wealth from walmar oh h Hallelujah from
[1:23:55] poverty to we from worry to Assurance
[1:24:00] from rejection out of all the rest of
[1:24:03] the people to the total acceptation not
[1:24:06] only of man but of almighty God she
[1:24:09] moves from despare to Hope can I repeat
[1:24:12] them to you again she moves from
[1:24:15] loneliness to love from write this down
[1:24:19] so you can write it down because it's
[1:24:20] describing you you can read it later
[1:24:23] from loneliness to love from toil to
[1:24:26] rest from poverty to wealth oh
[1:24:30] Hallelujah from worry to Assurance from
[1:24:34] despair to Hope I move from Darkness to
[1:24:38] light I move from loss to F I moved from
[1:24:42] Pentecost Amen to come and Su at the
[1:24:46] table with the Lord Jesus I was somebody

[1:25:55] so you went from being Miss
[1:25:58] Baptist Miss Church of God Miss
[1:26:01] Apostolic Miss jovah
[1:26:04] witness come on some of you is Miss
[1:26:06] Catholic Miss Lutheran some of you is
[1:26:09] Miss message people you didn't have the
[1:26:10] Holy Ghost yet but you just sitting in
[1:26:12] the message Church it ain't good enough
[1:26:14] to be C this message come on so you
[1:26:18] moveed from that to be called miseries
[1:26:20] Jesus
[1:26:22] Christ Oh Praise the Lord and all the
[1:26:26] people that were in the gate and the
[1:26:27] elders said we Are
[1:26:30] Witnesses the Lord make the woman that
[1:26:34] has come into thine house like Rachel
[1:26:38] and like
[1:26:39] Leah it's like a poetic
[1:26:42] term that God allows the people to say
[1:26:46] when they say this so they mention
[1:26:50] Rachel and Leah with a significance and
[1:26:54] and Rachel is named
[1:26:57] first but Rachel didn't have children
[1:27:00] first but yet Rachel is mentioned first
[1:27:04] because even though she struggled in
[1:27:07] having children she was Jacob's true
[1:27:11] love and remember it was Sarah that
[1:27:15] struggled to have children Rebecca going
[1:27:18] to that time in her life Rachel going to
[1:27:22] that time and her life don't you
[1:27:23] understand God was writing it in the Old
[1:27:25] Testament that sometime the chosen of
[1:27:28] his own heart will struggle to bring
[1:27:32] forth them Christ's children whenever
[1:27:35] the baren will bring forth more children
[1:27:37] and will bring them forth a whole lot
[1:27:39] easier then sometimes the chosen of God
[1:27:42] why would Sarah The Chosen wife of
[1:27:45] Abraham have such a hard time bringing
[1:27:46] forth and Abraham goes in one time to
[1:27:49] Hagar the Egyptian may he goes into her
[1:27:52] one time and she can sees he went into
[1:27:55] Sarah time and time and time and time
[1:27:59] again and failed and failed and failed
[1:28:02] and fail you can see why that God was
[1:28:04] writing the mystery of our lives in the
[1:28:07] lives of those women and Sarah would cry
[1:28:10] and lament and wonder oh God why me some
[1:28:14] of you it's been the greatest desire of
[1:28:16] your heart to Manifest this word that
[1:28:19] you hear and you go to church week after
[1:28:21] week month after month year after year
[1:28:24] say Lord will I ever be what I hear
[1:28:27] preach will I ever come to it yes you
[1:28:30] will and you need to quit asking the
[1:28:33] question and start making the statement
[1:28:36] yes I'm going to become what I hear
[1:28:39] preach that's the reason God's letting
[1:28:42] it fall on my ears and my ears are not
[1:28:45] de I want it I want it more than I want
[1:28:48] anything I wish somebody would hear me
[1:28:50] tonight I want it more than I want my
[1:28:53] food I want want it more than I need the
[1:28:55] drink of my body I want to become this
[1:28:58] word I want to become everything the
[1:29:02] Lord God wants me to be why do I have
[1:29:05] such a Time producing
[1:29:12] it Rachel and
[1:29:15] Leah
[1:29:17] both come from a
[1:29:20] heathen origin
[1:29:29] Rachel and Leah Donnie and Carol JD and
[1:29:32] Barbara Lance and
[1:29:35] Erica you and you and you and
[1:29:38] you turn around look at all the rest of
[1:29:40] them heathens sitting there by you
[1:29:41] former
[1:29:42] heathens that's
[1:29:46] right brother Rob ask Carol now if we
[1:29:49] give our little testimony about our
[1:29:52] life and Carol gave hers and I watched
[1:29:55] some of the young people and I was also
[1:29:57] looking at brother Rob as well and Carol
[1:29:59] told about being raised in a home or
[1:30:02] they didn't go to church and didn't read
[1:30:04] the
[1:30:05] Bible so when Carol got saved at the age
[1:30:09] of
[1:30:10] 16 was the first time she ever heard the
[1:30:13] story of Daniel and the lion
[1:30:19] stand she never knew about David and
[1:30:22] Goliath
[1:30:24] Abraham and Sarah in the Bible Belt in
[1:30:35] America it ain't no wonder she loves to
[1:30:37] go to church so much
[1:30:39] now
[1:30:40] Hallelujah think of it Living in America
[1:30:44] never most of your kids our our kids in
[1:30:47] Sunday school are taught these
[1:30:50] things and I I saw her there the other
[1:30:52] night as she was telling that and see
[1:30:54] her getting choked up and I saw brother
[1:30:56] Rob and I saw some of our young people
[1:30:58] sitting there in their eyes is getting
[1:31:00] real big oh my goodness this is the
[1:31:01] pastor's wife and the pastor's wife
[1:31:04] never knew nothing about Daniel never
[1:31:06] knew nothing about the lies then never
[1:31:08] knew nothing about
[1:31:09] it no but her name was on the book you
[1:31:13] see and God even though she didn't have
[1:31:16] a family that raised her up in the truth
[1:31:19] a family that read the Bible but God got
[1:31:22] a hold of her it was not Carol Jean
[1:31:25] Smith that was looking for God it was
[1:31:28] God looking for Carol Jean Smith it was
[1:31:31] not you looking for God it was not me
[1:31:34] looking for God oh but brother Donnie I
[1:31:36] went to that Youth Camp glory to God I
[1:31:38] made up my mind you baloney it was the
[1:31:41] spirit of God moving on you or you'd
[1:31:43] have been an outright Heathen you'd have
[1:31:45] been raised up and sitting in a message
[1:31:47] church and turned into the office
[1:31:49] Infidel ever was but almighty God moved
[1:31:52] over you and began to called on you
[1:31:54] because it was time for your name to be
[1:31:57] manifested on the earth God had a word
[1:32:01] about you God had a prophecy about you
[1:32:04] like he did Ruth the
[1:32:12] moabitas
[1:32:14] Hallelujah so these two are singled
[1:32:18] out by the
[1:32:21] people that the fertility
[1:32:24] that God gave to Rachel and
[1:32:28] Leah might be given to
[1:32:31] Rose all the people that were in the
[1:32:33] gate and the elders said we Are
[1:32:36] Witnesses the Lord make the woman that
[1:32:38] is coming to thine
[1:32:40] house like Rachel and like Leah which
[1:32:42] two did build the house of
[1:32:45] Israel wait a minute I thought men built
[1:32:48] it I didn't realize women could
[1:32:53] come on now you Brothers go ahead and
[1:32:55] say Amen it won't it won't hurt you say
[1:32:57] it it's all yeah come on ease it out
[1:32:59] ease it out there you
[1:33:03] go God is
[1:33:05] fixing to do something watch
[1:33:08] him which too did build the house of
[1:33:12] Israel and do thou worthily look at the
[1:33:16] word strength might wealth Force
[1:33:28] army
[1:33:30] army worthily in
[1:33:34] Fr oh I find it amazing now several
[1:33:38] hundred years after this what is it
[1:33:40] Micah chapter 5 oh thou
[1:33:48] Bethlehem though Thou Art the least
[1:33:50] among the
[1:33:51] princes yeah out of the shall come forth
[1:33:55] a
[1:33:56] prince which shall
[1:33:58] rule my
[1:34:00] people and Ruth's Destiny was tied to
[1:34:06] that Prince a farmer moabi
[1:34:11] this Glory
[1:34:15] IFH the Hebrew word eata means
[1:34:19] fruitful the people wanted Ruth to be
[1:34:22] fruitful and F
[1:34:25] and bring honor to their little town mm
[1:34:30] it was a place where Rachel was
[1:34:33] buried ah Rachel's Tomb we saw it
[1:34:36] several years ago Rachel's Tomb saw the
[1:34:39] very place where Rachel was buried so
[1:34:43] one was dead and another one was
[1:34:46] alive death and the living so one
[1:34:50] brought Fame to the tribes of Israel
[1:34:54] and God let her go by the way of the
[1:34:56] Grave another one is now alive in the
[1:35:00] same message and going to carry it on to
[1:35:03] the resurrection do you understand
[1:35:04] Christ and the bride merging together in
[1:35:06] the Rapture out of her Union with him
[1:35:11] will produce the son of David rain out
[1:35:14] of the
[1:35:16] Bride notice this in verse 12 let thy
[1:35:19] house be like the house of FZ
[1:35:25] whom
[1:35:28] Tamar bear unto
[1:35:30] Judah why are these people saying
[1:35:35] this now
[1:35:38] Rose be like Rachel be like
[1:35:44] Leah and let thy house be like the house
[1:35:47] of
[1:35:48] FZ whom Tamar bear unto Judah of the
[1:35:53] seed which the Lord shall give thee of
[1:35:58] this
[1:35:59] young
[1:36:03] woman
[1:36:06] FZ so FZ is the son of Judah by Tamar
[1:36:12] out of him come the family of the
[1:36:18] bethlehemit for it was out of them that
[1:36:22] Bethlehem was built
[1:36:25] so what's she doing she she is being
[1:36:29] identified the prophecy they are
[1:36:31] speaking is you are going to come back
[1:36:34] to the original
[1:36:36] inheritance of who you
[1:36:39] are friends this is why I think we need
[1:36:42] to stand like never before with our
[1:36:45] Pentecostal
[1:36:47] inheritance of Acts
[1:36:49] two I studyed on it today I'll tell you
[1:36:52] what I better had a spell I had to share
[1:36:53] the quotes to some of the brothers it
[1:36:55] was just so powerful what brother renam
[1:36:57] was talking about that Pentecost is our
[1:36:59] possession I'm ain't talking about his L
[1:37:01] the street I ain't talking about going
[1:37:03] back to just a bunch of emotion I'm
[1:37:05] talking about a real genuine experience
[1:37:08] of Acts chapter 2 can't you see what
[1:37:10] they're telling Ruth and they're saying
[1:37:12] about the union between Ruth and Boaz
[1:37:14] you're going back you are tied to the
[1:37:17] original founding of this city this city
[1:37:20] was built and named of a woman like you
[1:37:24] you are identified in that original
[1:37:27] identification of the word you're not
[1:37:29] Baptist you're not Church of God you're
[1:37:31] bride this is why you had eternal
[1:37:33] life notice this of the family of the
[1:37:37] bethlehemit you see the Jews say that
[1:37:42] Ruth was 40 years
[1:37:45] old
[1:37:47] Boaz is about 85 to
[1:37:51] 90 so they are announcing the blessing
[1:37:55] of God on this Union little did they
[1:38:01] realize from this Union would come the
[1:38:04] natural flesh of the
[1:38:07] genealogy of King
[1:38:11] David and the King of
[1:38:17] Kings
[1:38:19] tomarrow was a Canaanite
[1:38:24] Ruth a
[1:38:26] moabitas Rachel
[1:38:30] Leah
[1:38:32] heathens glory to
[1:38:34] God look at the genealogy of the Lord
[1:38:38] Jesus look at how many mothers females
[1:38:42] in the family tree that Matthew mentions
[1:38:45] look at how many of them were blotted by
[1:38:48] sin were heathens were in darkness and
[1:38:52] God chose the female to come through
[1:38:55] that don't you see your picture bride
[1:38:57] don't you see how you're
[1:39:01] identified judah's oldest son was er
[1:39:06] a so he married
[1:39:10] Tamar she become judah's
[1:39:14] daughter-in-law but the Bible says that
[1:39:16] ER was a wicked
[1:39:18] man and God killed him that's what your
[1:39:22] Bible says so Judah followed Jewish
[1:39:26] custom and gave
[1:39:28] Tamar to his second son which is
[1:39:32] Onan but Onan too was a wicked man so by
[1:39:37] custom Judah should have given Tamar to
[1:39:41] the youngest son whose name was Sheila s
[1:39:45] h e l a h
[1:39:49] Sheila but Judah thought man This
[1:39:51] Woman's killing men faster than I'm
[1:39:53] them it ain't worth a risk I I just
[1:39:56] can't do it I just can't do it I this is
[1:39:59] only boy I've Got My My My
[1:40:02] Tribe will be
[1:40:04] lost oh Lord
[1:40:07] God little did he
[1:40:10] know she wasn't supposed to bring forth
[1:40:13] the child from
[1:40:16] Sheila from the head of the
[1:40:19] tribe himself
[1:40:26] it would have been much more acceptable
[1:40:29] it would have looked a whole lot better
[1:40:31] it would have made a much cleaner
[1:40:35] story had she married
[1:40:40] Sheila but God knew he's going to have
[1:40:43] some pretty bad young
[1:40:45] ones well praise the Lord so he wanted
[1:40:47] to write some hope down through the
[1:40:49] scriptures didn't
[1:40:50] he so he actually tells sure you know
[1:40:54] let him get a little bit older and let
[1:40:55] him grow up a little bit and and and I
[1:40:57] I'll give him to you yeah fine that's
[1:40:58] that's what the Jewish custom says and
[1:41:00] I'll do it but it kept putting her off
[1:41:01] and putting her off but there was
[1:41:03] something inside of
[1:41:05] her she couldn't describe it I wish
[1:41:08] somebody had hear me tonight there was
[1:41:11] something down inside of her it wasn't
[1:41:15] lost this woman was not lasting to have
[1:41:19] an affair with a
[1:41:21] man there was something in her that was
[1:41:24] beyond
[1:41:26] explanation why do I have to deal with
[1:41:29] this Judah God he's making my life so
[1:41:33] miserable and making it so hard on me if
[1:41:36] she only wanted a man she could go to
[1:41:38] all kinds of other men she could reach
[1:41:40] out to all kinds of other men why she
[1:41:44] drw to
[1:41:48] Judah it consumed her
[1:41:55] remember it was not
[1:41:57] lust come
[1:42:02] on it was a
[1:42:05] desire for a
[1:42:07] union with a
[1:42:16] prince after judas's wife
[1:42:21] died he goes to the hearing of the
[1:42:24] sheep he and a friend of his on a
[1:42:27] Dolomite passed through a certain place
[1:42:28] and Timar hears about it you remember
[1:42:30] the
[1:42:31] story she dresses
[1:42:34] herself as a Canaanite
[1:42:38] prostitute which they would pain her
[1:42:41] eyes with
[1:42:44] stulum
[1:42:46] stulum an
[1:42:49] antimony we'll hear it tomorrow night if
[1:42:51] we get to it one of the
[1:42:56] questions she hides her face but they
[1:43:00] would paint her eyelashes their eyelids
[1:43:03] upper and
[1:43:04] bottom cuz to them to make the eye
[1:43:07] appear bigger more
[1:43:11] seductive so she takes on this
[1:43:15] look and Judah
[1:43:18] seesar and remember she's not looking
[1:43:21] just for any man
[1:43:25] but one
[1:43:28] man Buton was what she' done right no it
[1:43:32] wasn't it was not
[1:43:34] right but remember she's a heathen like
[1:43:38] some of us were a lot of the stuff we
[1:43:41] done wasn't right well come on don't sit
[1:43:43] there and look at me Google ey there's
[1:43:45] probably still things you're doing
[1:43:45] tonight that still ain't right well
[1:43:48] praise the Lord but God saw the desire
[1:43:52] don't you see how God looks at the soul
[1:43:55] and God sees that cry where did she get
[1:43:59] that oh mighty God buried within
[1:44:03] her that portion of that predestinated
[1:44:10] word I don't even like that
[1:44:13] man he's treated me bad he's been mean
[1:44:17] to me he's deprived me I don't even like
[1:44:21] this guy
[1:44:23] why is
[1:44:24] it that I'm
[1:44:27] yearning I'm longing for something it's
[1:44:31] I don't
[1:44:36] understand she
[1:44:38] wanted a
[1:44:40] Judah
[1:44:48] Offspring she didn't just
[1:44:51] want offspring
[1:44:55] she
[1:44:56] wanted a
[1:44:58] Judah
[1:45:01] Offspring I don't want just Offspring at
[1:45:05] our
[1:45:06] church come on we
[1:45:10] want
[1:45:12] Jesus
[1:45:15] Offspring amen
[1:45:32] there's a strange thing in her the
[1:45:37] tribal Chief
[1:45:40] himself one many times she she talked to
[1:45:43] herself and said are you
[1:45:46] nuts dear you out of your mind you know
[1:45:50] what he'll do to you this man is a
[1:45:53] tribal
[1:45:54] chief he could have you killed just like
[1:45:58] that get this out of your
[1:46:02] mind wait for him wait wait for SAA a
[1:46:06] Kate
[1:46:12] Kate
[1:46:14] Pho the Jewish historian who lived in
[1:46:16] the time of the New Testament wrote this
[1:46:18] about
[1:46:19] her Tamar was a woman from Syria
[1:46:23] Palestina who had been brought up in her
[1:46:25] own native city which was devoted to the
[1:46:27] worship of many
[1:46:29] gods being full of statues and images
[1:46:32] and in short of Idols of every kind and
[1:46:36] description but when she emerging as it
[1:46:38] were out of profound
[1:46:41] Darkness was able to see a slight beam
[1:46:45] of
[1:46:46] Truth she then at the risk of her
[1:46:50] life exerted all her
[1:46:53] energies to arrive at
[1:46:56] piety living for the service of and Inc
[1:47:00] constant
[1:47:02] supplication to the one true
[1:47:05] God Tamar was struck in a very hard
[1:47:09] place because she had been
[1:47:12] returned to her father's
[1:47:18] house you see when her husbands died she
[1:47:21] had no place to go
[1:47:23] yeah so your final tells us she went
[1:47:25] back to her father's house her father's
[1:47:33] Gods her father's
[1:47:36] worship but Tamar couldn't be satis
[1:47:40] father should been around
[1:47:44] Yahweh Oh Glory to God am I'll tell you
[1:47:48] one thing I've been studying this week
[1:47:50] you want know why I'm so all cranked up
[1:47:51] tonight
[1:47:53] I found a new name of
[1:47:56] God I've been setting this Bible for my
[1:47:58] whole life setting this message for over
[1:48:01] 40 years and studying this week I found
[1:48:04] something in the word I thought Lord
[1:48:05] have mercy it ain't no wonder that's
[1:48:07] going to take eternity oh it ain't new
[1:48:10] it's just new to
[1:48:12] me been there in the Bible the whole
[1:48:14] time oh my no I ain't going to tell you
[1:48:16] about it you have to come back
[1:48:20] Sunday so she had no status
[1:48:24] she had no security no welfare no social
[1:48:27] security no check no
[1:48:32] nothing her only
[1:48:35] hope was a
[1:48:39] child but not
[1:48:42] just any
[1:48:48] child but a child for a certain man
[1:48:53] we remember the
[1:48:55] story
[1:48:57] Judah finally finds out about and he's
[1:49:00] going to have her stoned
[1:49:02] burned and then she presents his staff
[1:49:05] of course his
[1:49:07] identification so
[1:49:09] Tamar conceives
[1:49:12] twins now remember who these twins are
[1:49:16] of her
[1:49:18] father-in-law little could Judah have
[1:49:21] realized
[1:49:23] he would be the father of a great
[1:49:25] multitude and Christ would descend
[1:49:28] lineally out of his own body of the
[1:49:31] Union between Judah and
[1:49:40] Tamar God never chose to bring his line
[1:49:44] through FZ God never chose to bring his
[1:49:47] L to this flesh that flesh God chose
[1:49:51] Judah the lion of the
[1:49:55] tribe of
[1:49:57] Judah not sheilah not air not
[1:50:03] Onan but Judah himself I don't know
[1:50:06] about you I don't want to be pregnant
[1:50:09] with a seed of a
[1:50:11] Preacher I don't want to bring forth a
[1:50:13] Tim Brit I don't want to bring forth a
[1:50:15] Donnie Reagan or a Ron Spencer or a
[1:50:17] Daryl Ward come on somebody or a Pete
[1:50:20] Lawson or some other preacher why what I
[1:50:22] want to bring forth the image of some
[1:50:24] man when I can bring forth the image of
[1:50:27] Jesus Christ I don't want you to be a
[1:50:29] bunch of Reagan I don't want you to act
[1:50:31] like me I don't want you well I want to
[1:50:33] be just like brother Donnie no you don't
[1:50:35] you want to be like the Lord Jesus why
[1:50:38] would you settle or want to be like me
[1:50:40] or want to be like some other preacher
[1:50:42] when the Lord God is offering you
[1:50:46] himself and the proy of your womb can be
[1:50:49] Christ the anointed word not some f
[1:50:53] man like
[1:51:01] me Genesis 38:28 and it came to pass
[1:51:06] when she travailed that
[1:51:08] one put out his
[1:51:10] hand and the Midwife took and bound upon
[1:51:13] his
[1:51:14] hand a
[1:51:16] Scarlet
[1:51:19] thread saying this came out first
[1:51:24] scarlet color of redemption now and it
[1:51:28] came to pass as he drew back his hand
[1:51:31] that behold his brother come
[1:51:37] out if you look at Tamar just right
[1:51:40] you'll see yourself right
[1:51:45] there you should have come forth the
[1:51:48] Scarlet one amen that should have been
[1:51:51] the first birth
[1:51:53] but instead it drew back and this come
[1:51:57] forth
[1:52:05] first behold his brother came out and
[1:52:08] she said hast thou broken
[1:52:12] forth this
[1:52:15] breach be upon thee therefore his name
[1:52:18] is called
[1:52:20] FES so here here was the
[1:52:25] breach Lord
[1:52:27] children here is the
[1:52:31] breach you should have come
[1:52:34] forth in the right way but you
[1:52:38] bypassed there
[1:52:40] theophany so the theophany pull
[1:52:45] back and the breach come for us here you
[1:52:48] go gray
[1:52:50] hair go say contacts false
[1:52:54] teeth false knees false hips well the
[1:52:58] rest of us live a whole lot much longer
[1:53:00] I don't know how much plastic we're you
[1:53:01] know how much real stuff we're going to
[1:53:02] have R st is going to be plastic and
[1:53:04] stainless steel come on somebody man Al
[1:53:08] we used to preach about the body chain
[1:53:09] the Lord changing Adams he's going to
[1:53:11] start changing stainless steel one of
[1:53:12] these days I'm not sure how that's going
[1:53:13] to work some of you that's gotten you
[1:53:16] got joints is made out of this and that
[1:53:18] and other I imagine if the Lord could
[1:53:19] change a bone or change a cell he could
[1:53:21] turn a t St Ste in one good day so what
[1:53:24] did happened we should have been that
[1:53:26] should have been me that was my right
[1:53:30] yes but instead it pulled back and then
[1:53:32] your eye come like
[1:53:35] this the
[1:53:36] breach and the
[1:53:38] breach was upon
[1:53:48] me and
[1:53:51] afterward came out his
[1:53:56] brother that had the scared
[1:54:00] thread upon his
[1:54:05] hand that was the redeemable
[1:54:10] me glory to
[1:54:12] God I was identified with the Scarlet
[1:54:15] thread before I was ever
[1:54:20] born thank you Jesus
[1:54:25] and his name was called
[1:54:29] Zarah so Zarah put his hand out first
[1:54:33] but feris
[1:54:36] notice from whom Christ came
[1:54:41] forth so actually
[1:54:45] Christ j can't you see it what a
[1:54:49] beautiful story Christ didn't come forth
[1:54:53] from
[1:54:55] Zarah the one with the
[1:54:58] Scarlet Christ came
[1:55:01] forth from the
[1:55:05] breach
[1:55:08] feris so he had to
[1:55:11] become a man
[1:55:14] himself a kinsman redeemer so he
[1:55:16] couldn't come in the form of theophan
[1:55:17] and go to the cross the theophan
[1:55:19] couldn't die so he had to come in the
[1:55:21] form of feris
[1:55:24] so the breach was upon him but somebody
[1:55:26] he had to take the seals or than himself
[1:55:28] here is the
[1:55:30] breach this is the missing link between
[1:55:34] God and man oh we talk about a missing
[1:55:37] link being the serpent yeah that's only
[1:55:39] one side of it but there was another
[1:55:41] Missing Link here's the mystery of it
[1:55:43] right here hallelujah the Lord God was
[1:55:47] that Missing Link but he must condens
[1:55:49] send between his holy righteousness and
[1:55:51] no holy man how does he do it to the
[1:55:53] lineage of
[1:56:04] Fes Oh Glory to
[1:56:07] God so Judah calls his name
[1:56:13] feris or
[1:56:18] breaker breaker
[1:56:24] so he's a chain
[1:56:26] breaker a sin breaker a devil breaker a
[1:56:31] bondage
[1:56:33] breaker
[1:56:36] Oh Glory to God glory to God I wish I
[1:56:41] was out in the woods by
[1:56:42] myself uhhuh I sure do right now cuz I'm
[1:56:46] afraid if I really act like I feel some
[1:56:47] of y'all go to passing out like flies
[1:56:50] I'll tell you one thing I don't know
[1:56:51] what you're seeing you're tonight but
[1:56:52] I'm seeing the mystery of redemption I'm
[1:56:54] not looking just back in history but I'm
[1:56:56] looking right here tonight and seeing
[1:56:59] myself in this open book I hope you're
[1:57:01] seeing yourself in this open book oh it
[1:57:04] was that Scarlet one that's the one
[1:57:06] you're longing for that's why we're
[1:57:08] never satisfied living in Fes we're
[1:57:11] longing for the Scarlet one but brother
[1:57:14] sister we've got to overcome farz the
[1:57:17] breach we've got to come through the
[1:57:20] breaker in order to bring to the
[1:57:22] Redemption of
[1:57:30] Zarah let me
[1:57:34] close RSE
[1:57:38] 4:13 so Boaz took
[1:57:42] Ruth and she became his
[1:57:45] wife and he went in unto
[1:57:49] her the lord gave her conception
[1:57:55] and she
[1:57:56] bear a
[1:57:58] son by Boaz an old man when she had been
[1:58:04] married in her previous
[1:58:06] marriage to a young
[1:58:09] man but through that
[1:58:12] Union no
[1:58:15] Offspring but she marries an old
[1:58:19] man and the lord gave her
[1:58:23] conception and she
[1:58:25] bear a
[1:58:28] son so the souljourn in Moab lasted
[1:58:31] about 10 years now believe it or
[1:58:34] not how many ever weeks it's taken me to
[1:58:37] bring this to
[1:58:39] you actually it only happened in about
[1:58:42] four or five weeks they say the Book of
[1:58:45] Ruth the span of it was about four or
[1:58:48] five weeks whenever it come to the time
[1:58:51] they first crossed Jordan to come back
[1:58:53] in and go through this whole process her
[1:58:57] life was changed in about four or five
[1:59:01] weeks so she went from being this woman
[1:59:04] that was looked down upon and reproached
[1:59:07] to becoming in the very lineage of the
[1:59:10] Lord Jesus so from that time until the
[1:59:13] time that he takes her to
[1:59:16] himself so Boaz took Ruth and she became
[1:59:19] his wife was his wife and he went into
[1:59:21] her and the lord gave her conception and
[1:59:25] bear a son let me close with
[1:59:28] this what Eve failed to do spoken words
[1:59:31] of region of seed Mary
[1:59:34] did she took the word eve took Satan's
[1:59:38] lie Mary took God's
[1:59:41] word and through Mary's
[1:59:44] seed replenishes the
[1:59:46] Earth again through his bride through
[1:59:51] the word he will bring
[1:59:53] up the
[1:59:58] Millennium when Christ and the bride
[2:00:00] unite together and we go to the marriage
[2:00:03] supper and at the end of the tribulation
[2:00:06] period out of the finalization of our
[2:00:10] union he was King God King Jesus king
[2:00:15] theophany so when we merge together and
[2:00:18] we become body C genene
[2:00:22] theophany we merge in that Holy Union to
[2:00:25] King God King Jesus king theophany you
[2:00:29] will also be your correct Trinity you
[2:00:32] will come together after the marriage
[2:00:35] supper of the Lamb your union
[2:00:39] finalized will
[2:00:41] produce the son of
[2:00:44] David out of your spiritual
[2:00:48] womb will
[2:00:50] come from
[2:00:57] Millennium well if I didn't give you
[2:00:59] enough to think about tonight you can
[2:01:01] come back Sunday and I'll try
[2:01:11] again we'll pick this up again Lord
[2:01:13] willing next time in verse 14 and the
[2:01:15] women said
[2:01:17] unto
[2:01:20] Naomi ah
[2:01:23] so through the Redemption of Ruth Naomi
[2:01:26] is going to get placed again in her
[2:01:30] proper
[2:01:31] position and the women said unto Naomi
[2:01:34] blessed be the
[2:01:36] Lord which haveth not left
[2:01:39] thee this day without a Kinsman yes and
[2:01:45] that his name may be
[2:01:47] famous in
[2:01:50] Israel Naomi didn't give
[2:01:54] birth it was through
[2:01:56] roseth that she come back the
[2:02:02] 144,000 don't you understand the prophet
[2:02:04] says they will be the ones in the bride
[2:02:08] chamber in the
[2:02:11] Millennium Israel will never be accepted
[2:02:14] back to God again in marriage by
[2:02:19] nationality think of it one at a time
[2:02:21] Jews can come and be a part of the
[2:02:23] Gentile bride because it's of all
[2:02:25] Nations but in the Millennium they will
[2:02:28] be replaced again Ezekiel 44-48 being
[2:02:31] the rebuilding of the temple in the
[2:02:33] Millennium and they will come through
[2:02:34] the gates and all that if you'd like to
[2:02:36] read it sometime and what will it be
[2:02:38] after Boaz and Ruth come together out of
[2:02:41] that Holy Union then the 144,000 will
[2:02:45] again be identified in Temple
[2:02:49] worship through their productivity
[2:02:52] of the Gentile
[2:02:55] bread and the women said unto me blessed
[2:02:58] be the Lord which ha not lift the this
[2:03:00] day without a Kinsman that his name may
[2:03:02] be famous in Israel and he shall be unto
[2:03:05] thee a
[2:03:07] restorer of thy
[2:03:10] life and a
[2:03:12] nourisher of thine old
[2:03:15] age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth
[2:03:19] thee which is better to thee than seven
[2:03:25] sons you were excluded
[2:03:28] Naomi out of the seven Church
[2:03:33] ages but God has given you a
[2:03:37] Ruth and out of this Gentile bride she
[2:03:41] has borne
[2:03:43] him and he will be a restorer of thy
[2:03:46] life and Naomi took the
[2:03:50] child and laid it in her
[2:03:53] bosom and became
[2:03:55] nurse unto
[2:03:58] it so Naomi becomes the
[2:04:02] nurse of
[2:04:04] OED now this Hebrew phraseology is she
[2:04:09] adopts
[2:04:12] him
[2:04:15] amen she adopts little
[2:04:20] OED so here it is she's an old woman
[2:04:24] now but this young child has
[2:04:28] restored her
[2:04:31] life and brought her back to being a
[2:04:34] young woman
[2:04:37] again and the women of Bethlehem named
[2:04:41] the boy
[2:04:43] OED which
[2:04:46] means
[2:04:49] worshiper worshiper
[2:04:54] the Bible tells
[2:04:56] us then shall the knowledge of the
[2:05:00] Lord cover the
[2:05:03] Earth as the waters do the
[2:05:08] Seas we as the Gentile
[2:05:11] bride part of our dispensation under the
[2:05:14] Millennium is the sons of God will be
[2:05:17] out
[2:05:19] teaching the millenn the heathen
[2:05:22] in the
[2:05:24] Millennium of our Lord Jesus the
[2:05:28] Jews the 144,000 which also receive the
[2:05:31] Holy Ghost will be out there in the
[2:05:33] Millennium teaching the Heathen remember
[2:05:36] heathens that's raised in the Millennium
[2:05:38] that never had the opportunity and we
[2:05:41] must teach
[2:05:43] them out of that
[2:05:45] Naomi will be
[2:05:48] restored to our position
[2:05:52] but you my
[2:05:54] friends are not
[2:05:56] Naomi
[2:05:58] you
[2:06:02] arose yes
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:08] beloved it's
[2:06:13] B so
[2:06:15] Naomi the empty
[2:06:17] one is now
[2:06:20] full remember she said when they came
[2:06:22] from
[2:06:24] Moab she was
[2:06:27] bitter but now God has turned her
[2:06:30] bitterness into
[2:06:32] Joy the Jews which still don't
[2:06:35] understand to this day the Holocaust
[2:06:38] they don't understand all the deaths of
[2:06:40] their people and they're bitter they
[2:06:41] have
[2:06:43] resentment I don't know if you know it
[2:06:45] or not but there is a great population
[2:06:47] of the Jews around the world that do not
[2:06:50] even believe in God
[2:06:52] they are
[2:06:54] atheist they do not believe in God
[2:06:57] because they say how could there be a
[2:06:59] loving God and him allow their people to
[2:07:02] go through what they
[2:07:04] did they don't believe in God and they
[2:07:07] have such an attitude against God it was
[2:07:10] not God that did that they brought it on
[2:07:14] themselves but oh hang on naom me your
[2:07:19] joy will come back
[2:07:21] you'll find favor in his
[2:07:25] sight and Gentile Branch don't you be
[2:07:29] arrogant and proud in
[2:07:31] yourself it's the mercy of God given to
[2:07:34] us by which we could be accepted as his
[2:07:39] wife don't you love him tonight
[2:07:43] children you may struggle and wonder God
[2:07:46] why can't I bring forth just be faithful
[2:07:50] Sarah remember
[2:07:52] remember it was Rachel that went to
[2:07:54] Jacob and said give me children a I die
[2:07:56] give me children here I die he said am I
[2:08:00] God can I do that but it was like these
[2:08:03] women were consumed with it they're your
[2:08:08] type they knew they were supposed to be
[2:08:10] mothers they couldn't understand why
[2:08:13] would God delay it why would God let
[2:08:15] Hagar bring forth why would God let this
[2:08:17] one why would God let that one do you
[2:08:19] understand the 12 sons of Edom Esau
[2:08:24] every one of those 12 sons which become
[2:08:27] 12 tribal heads every one of them got
[2:08:30] their inheritance before any of Jacob's
[2:08:34] 12 sons
[2:08:36] did Esau's Sons didn't have to go to
[2:08:39] Egypt they didn't have to go to Babylon
[2:08:41] they were not beat by the whips of the
[2:08:44] Egyptians they were Edomite princes and
[2:08:48] they received Mighty kingdoms they
[2:08:50] didn't have to labor for it
[2:08:53] God just blessed them you hear it all
[2:08:55] the time people say oh Lord the Lord's
[2:08:56] blessed me the Lord's blessed me I know
[2:08:58] I must be in his will that shows how
[2:09:01] blind they are blessings don't mean
[2:09:04] you're in his will you can be out of the
[2:09:06] will of God a thousand miles away from
[2:09:08] the will of God and the blessing still
[2:09:10] fall on you they did the children of
[2:09:12] Israel their shoes never wore out and
[2:09:14] their clothes never wore out they never
[2:09:16] had to work or labor for 40 years for
[2:09:18] their food and Judgment of God was PR
[2:09:21] anounced upon them not a one of them
[2:09:22] made it in of that
[2:09:24] generation and yet the real tribe
[2:09:27] struggled and
[2:09:28] struggled it's always been that
[2:09:32] way how many would say God give me
[2:09:35] strength help me that I won't be weary
[2:09:38] Lord help me that I'll be like Sarah
[2:09:40] I'll continue I'll be like
[2:09:43] Rebecca I'll believe Lord yes
[2:09:47] Lord Lord Jesus I pray you'd forgive us
[2:09:50] father
[2:09:53] I'm sure that we're much like they
[2:09:55] were it's easy for me to see why Sarah
[2:09:59] would have believed she was not even
[2:10:00] part of your
[2:10:02] program you went for many years before
[2:10:06] you ever even spoke her
[2:10:08] name as being part of the Covenant it's
[2:10:11] easy for me to see as a human why she
[2:10:15] thought maybe Hagar would be the
[2:10:17] way cuz all of your
[2:10:20] blessings was pronounced to Abraham you
[2:10:24] was going to make him the father you
[2:10:25] said nothing about making her the
[2:10:29] mother you said one blessing after
[2:10:31] another after another to him
[2:10:35] only how what a struggle it must have
[2:10:38] been for how hard it must have been
[2:10:40] feeling like she was left
[2:10:42] out but one day the seals broke
[2:10:47] open and it was at that meeting when you
[2:10:50] met Abraham and said your name will no
[2:10:54] longer be
[2:10:57] Abram so you took the H out of your
[2:11:02] name and you divided his
[2:11:06] name
[2:11:07] Abram you cut his name in
[2:11:10] two and dropped the H down in the middle
[2:11:14] of his
[2:11:16] name and said you are
[2:11:18] called Abraham
[2:11:22] I'm big
[2:11:23] Elohim and you're little
[2:11:27] Elohim I give you the letter
[2:11:30] H and oh yeah when you go back home tell
[2:11:35] your wife she's no longer
[2:11:40] Seri I'm going to drop the
[2:11:44] ey and I'm going to cap her name the
[2:11:48] Capstone will be h
[2:11:51] s a r a
[2:11:55] h so finally Sarah receiv receives it
[2:12:01] part of the
[2:12:02] name of
[2:12:05] God oh I can't imagine how she must have
[2:12:10] felt in the tent that day when Abraham
[2:12:13] finally told
[2:12:14] her he talked about you
[2:12:18] today he talked about you
[2:12:23] glory to God
[2:12:26] father you talked about us
[2:12:29] tonight Glory you talked about
[2:12:33] me my brothers my sisters you talked
[2:12:36] about my wife my children my
[2:12:40] grandchildren my

[2:25:10] sisters surely after this sermon tonight
[2:25:13] you can see that women have played a
[2:25:16] great part in God's economy
[2:25:20] if God could take Tamar and remember God
[2:25:24] did not approve of the way she went
[2:25:25] about doing it God did not approve of
[2:25:28] the way that David and Batha bath
[2:25:30] sheba's situation was but God used them
[2:25:35] so if you use them Tamar and the rest of
[2:25:38] them can he use you
[2:25:41] sisters to be a daughter of God that can
[2:25:44] reflect the light of the Gospel of this
[2:25:46] age be a light and a witness not only to
[2:25:50] our youths that a witness to the place
[2:25:52] where you work and all that you do Let
[2:25:55] Jesus Shine himself through you remember
[2:25:58] sisters because of your clothes and your
[2:26:01] dress and your hair and so on you carry
[2:26:04] a greater element of reproach than the
[2:26:07] brothers as a matter of fact when you
[2:26:10] get there that day your reward in some
[2:26:13] ways will be
[2:26:16] greater I can't wait to see you
[2:26:19] daughters of God and I'm going to be
[2:26:21] standing there near you as your
[2:26:25] Shepherd when the Lord Jesus goes to
[2:26:27] calling your
[2:26:29] names I'm going to stand there as your
[2:26:32] Shepherd and watch you as you go
[2:26:35] up and see each of you as your reward is
[2:26:39] given to you and he identifies your life

[2:27:05] you dressed and acted and you'll realize
[2:27:09] what a great thing God has placed upon
