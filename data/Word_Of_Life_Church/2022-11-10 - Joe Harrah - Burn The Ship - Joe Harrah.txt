if you'll turn to Isaiah 43 we're going to read verses 15 through 19. no good thank you Isaiah says I am the Lord your Holy One the creator of Israel your king thus saith the Lord which maketh a way in the sea in a path in the mighty Waters which bringeth forth The Chariot in the horse the Army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as to Hope this is what I want us to look at tonight remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old and don't think other things as how they were how they used to be you know we're told in Revelations we're supposed to come up higher God told John said come up higher things are going to come up higher see things from my viewpoint see the things that are to come things that are to be don't keep looking at things at your lower level firstly level and so many times I think we get stuck in that to where we we just we get in a rut and we see things how we perceive instead of seeing them by faith so behold I will do a new thing and now it shall spring forth and shall ye not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we've come together another time lord to celebrate you to give you praise to have every mind every heart every soul in here tonight focused on you nothing but you Lord if it was focused on me they're going to hear mistakes they're going to hear me stammer around try to find words try to find things to say Lord if they focus on you I pray they won't hear me Lord get me out of the way father that you can use the gift that you've given as you see fit Lord you've given them a gift of hearing you've given them a gift of receiving Lord and if they would get out of the way and let you use their ears use their hearts and you would have your way Lord from the front to the back everyone will leave blessed Lord your prophets told us you'll either come in but you'll either leave better or worse though or not I trust and believe tonight will all leave better because we've heard your word and we apply it to our lives we thank you for it Lord I pray for brother Daryl you know he's having a time with his back for Daniel Ball's family there feeling sick Lord I pray you touched them Lord Brother Roberts need their lord his little assembly Lord I pray that you've blessed bless him richly lift him up Lord we want to give you praise for brother Phil and sister Ruth's little baby there Lord for for touching it Lord all the praise goes to you we're so thankful bless the further service in Jesus name amen he's gonna be seated I've titled this tonight might sound weird but I'll tell you how I come to this title my title has burned the ship now I didn't get it from hearing a song I've been thinking a lot lately about people that have left people that have just picked it up and left and walked off so I was thinking about the other day and this thought this kept coming to my mind burned the ship I thought what how does that apply and it just stayed in my mind I'd go to work and it taught this came come into my mind burned the ship so I looked in the scriptures I Googled the scriptures say anything about burning ships nothing so I I went to the table in 1960 brother Branham said hearing receiving and acting therefore their church needs a good cleansing what we need today is some old-fashioned Revival some sweeping revivals some power of the Lord work we need men and women who's willing willing to sell out everything in this world to burn every bridge behind them we need to take the world today we ministers like the old Norwegians used to take a country they went in by ship they hit the shore set the ship of Fire and burned it behind them there was no way of Escape that's the way we ought to do burn every bridge every Escape sell out everything for the kingdom of God and keep moving on there's no place of stopping there's no place of compromising in Luke chapter 9 57-62 Jesus said in the Bible scripture says and it came to pass they went this way in a certain man said unto him Lord I will follow thee wherever thou goest Jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds have of the air have Nest but the son of man have no nowhere to lay his head and he said unto another this is Jesus saying to another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go bury my father and Jesus said unto him let the dead bury the dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of God and another also said Lord I will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at my house Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back as fit for the kingdom of God no man looking back you know we see this throughout the scriptures and Isaiah says remember you're not the former things neither consider the things of old that's what happened to the children of Israel they begin to remember how good it was back there they lost sight of what God was taking them to they lost sight of the promised land they lost sight of the word this was God's word I'll take you into a promised land that flows with milk and honey everywhere you put your feet is your possessions they lost sight of that they did not hang on to the faith that God gave them for that and so they begin to consider the former things to look back to the things of old oh they said we want to we'd love to have the the leaks and the garlics we had in Egypt and here we see the same thing around this message is people going back to where they came from and I wrote down here this message is surrounded by ships that have not been burned ships that haven't been burned because they never dedicated themselves to when they first got here they parked it there when brother Branham healing campaign was going around the world they pulled their ships up to his healing campaign and did not burn them all they wanted to see was the swerks the signs the Wonders that's all they wanted to see and when God presented him with the new land the healings the raising the dead that wasn't the new land God wanted him to go to well he offered him the word this is eternal life what did they do many went back to their ships they pulled up their sails and they sailed away it's still happening today people that parked their ships on this message 40 years ago are leaving pastors that claim to be the voice of God have went back to their ships and they've sailed away I've got a subtitle to this is where has the Zeal gone where's it went we're so used to our traditions we traditionalize Church we've made it a ritual that we come to on Sunday on Wednesday it's part of our schedule we'll write it in our calendar have to go to church you have to [Music] you have to I have to go listen to God is exactly what you're saying you get to you get to go hear the voice of one that loves you more than anything [Applause] we got people that jump their ship they don't agree with the pastor don't raise your hand but how many could say in their heart speak to yourself I have the same Zeal or more that I had when I got here five years ago ten years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago if it's the same you haven't went anywhere you say I have the same Zeal I had 30 years ago get away from your ship you haven't burnt your ship yet but you're looking at it you're eyeballing it burn it burn it you've got no nowhere better to go you say this is tough this is hard where did we get this term burn the ships anybody know some of you history Buffs know Cortez right is one of them Cortez was one of them when he came to to Mexico this was a new lamp he wanted to conquer this land nothing was going to stand between him and his mission so what did he tell us his men burn the ships we're not going back nothing's going to stop us history say that when Caesar tried to take go up around into Ireland Scotland and then in places that when you come around the north scene he looked at the Cliffs of Dover or whatever Cliffs they were and all the the the Celts that were lining The Cliffs looking at him was way more than the many had that he could have turned his ships around grab the tiller and turn him around and hit it back the other way but he told the man we're going up we're gonna anchor these ships and we're going to burn them Alexander when he takes Persia he tells his men burn the ships that is a commission that you've had in this day burn your ship you've raised your hand and said this is where I want to be this is where God brought me this is where my ship has landed your ship has been through so many things some of you have been through the shifts of denomination and and the waves and the way you've you've come through so many different Waters you've come through through ministers that want to make a name for themselves they want want their own following you've been through all that and then one night when you're you're shipped it's just drifting along and you think there's no help there's nowhere else to go you heard a steal small voice and you looked and far off the distance you see no lighthouse and you set yourself for that you turned your your the tiller and the rudder to set your your ship straight for that and you headed for that it wasn't easy getting here for some of you you know like I told uh where I preached Senate brother Homer's here a month or so ago you know I could look at people that have been through so much they've come through denominate I was born in it you say what kind of testimony do you have I don't have the testimony that somebody's been through so many things almost died of drug overdoses and almost getting killed here and and things happening here can be caught up in a cult here I don't have that testimony but I have a testimony of Grace that God kept me from that God seemed fit to drop me into place me in a family that was already brought into this message I don't know I don't have a less of a testimony than you you don't have a lesser greater testimony than me every one of it's a testimony of God's grace but it seems like there's no Zeal anymore people want to be petted and rocked father minister their Pastor come in and feed me prop my feet up rock me to sleep hey I can put it I can put you to sleep I've put a bunch of them y'all I can see more faces up here than you can I know when you're sleeping hey I slept on brother Daryl woke me up in Alabama one time he's in youth service well he's up all night wasn't we Joel we were up all night and I was tired I wasn't saying brother Daryl was boring me I was just tired I closed my eyes the next thing I heard was ain't that right brother Joe hey I didn't go back to sleep I don't know what he said but I agreed with him so we look at that and we've become we've traditionalized it's a ritual now we've got it in our mind how service is supposed to go we know how you know and I want I thought somebody why don't why don't you write down what how you think service should go and give it to Brother Louie give it to brother Joel and him tell him hey do service this way this is where it's supposed to go these are the people that I want singing This is how long I want the minister preaching people know how long ministers are supposed to preach people that ain't preachers know how long a preacher's supposed to preach here's the way I look at it and I'm probably different than everybody else because they always stole the quote the brother Brandon said 30 45 minutes and y'all know me I think I in North Carolina I think I preached an hour and seven minutes I think that's a record that's a record and I apologized but you look at it as brother they throw that clothes brother Brandon said a Minister's supposed to preach 30 to 45 minutes you're saying this is Manna From Heaven Are you full have you had enough have you ate too much rituals traditions you get mad if somebody beside you is shouting too loud praising God too loud I've got some news for you there's no Xanax in heaven because if that bothers you you're going to have a Time but where is our desire gone your heart was setting running this race at all cost you pulled your ship ashore God LED you here you gave testimonies of how God pulled you out of whatever you was in pulled you here and you're praising God for it and as time goes on if you don't ever talk about it no more you move from the front row to the back row where's this deal I'm not saying whether you burnt your ship or not but I'm just asking you have you have you burned it or have you left it there if you're a predestinated son and daughter of God there's burnt holes laying all around this message you've burned it you left it on the shore you've anchored it you said I'll never go back I don't care what tests come my way I don't care what Trials come my way I don't care what Satan puts against me where are you going to go to where are you gonna go you got something better than this it's it's hard it's narrow right the Bible says narrow is the way Merrell don't even consider what you left behind don't even consider the mistakes that you've made all that stuff you carried on your ship you should have burned it with it don't grab all that luggage off before you set fire to your ship and carry it with your Shore all your faults your mistakes things that you regret burn your regrets burn your mistakes don't don't bring them ashore with you there's no room in God's word for your mistakes there's no room for your regrets there's no room for all your faults and your failures God don't see them so quit trying to shove them through the blood that's what we do we try to shove them through the blood look what I did God said I forgive you but look what I did I forgave you but God remember when I did this back here and we force it and we force it and we try to force it through the blood of Jesus Christ and we make calference not a fact we're looking at yourself and look at God's grace [Applause] when Jesus went to the 70. when you see the son of man ascending into heaven from whence he came what did they say this guy is saying he came from heaven he came from heaven and the Bible says that they turned away and walked with him no more he he called him did he not come follow me come follow me that's what we're reading in Luke he was saying hey follow me hey I need to go do this first hey you come follow me I need to do this first so they maybe they went and done it I don't know maybe they went and done it but then they eventually followed him and you gotta the same thing that happened in in the prophet's message they followed him they followed him these 70 followed him when he was racing to death they followed him when he was turning the water into wine we got to follow this guy watch what he does we want to be part of that all these ministers wanted to surround themselves to brother Brandon we want to be part of that and then Jesus says when you see him ascending to Heaven from whence I came what's he talking about who does he think he is except you eat my flesh and drink my blood well in the world is he talking about we're leaving on this guy's crazy I'm getting out of here and the brother Brandon brought serpent seat right the godhead predestination they jumped on their ships we didn't want that they left he brought the new land that God had given the milk and honey God says okay now you give him the milk and honey it don't look like it does it When the Children is or was going into into the land of Canaan God said this is the land that flows with milk and honey and it's all yours and everywhere they looked as Giants where's the milk and honey it's faith it's Faith that's how your walk is when you go to work when you go to work and you see the word things that work don't quit trying to fit in quit trying to fit in you parked your little ship on the edge of this message and you want to try to just toe the line let's walk along the shoreline so you'll feel like I want to be accepted that's the problem with people today they want to be accepted I want God to accept me that's all that matters and you've got people that want to be accepted they want to toe the line we want to see how close they can to theirs oh yeah they'll wither they'll wear their skirts and and what have you to work but they might put a little color on their fingers on their mouth right wear the little clip-on earrings right how close you getting to the edge you cannot fight on the shoreline the enemies in the land you're not fighting you're trying to fit in so while you're standing there get you a torch torch your ship in all its baggage and go fight that's all that's all he's called us to do so brother Brandon says in 64 when their eyes was open they knew him he turned around he had 70 with him he said to that 70s what will you say when you see the son of man ascending from heaven from which he came he asked him a question what will you say they looked at one another and said well the son of man is sending up from where he came from they asked this question we know his mother we know his brothers his sisters we see the the manger he was Lady when he was born we've seen the Cradle he was rocked in he come from Nazareth this is a hard saying and they didn't walk with him no more and all the time these disciples stood right there they didn't know it but they believed it they didn't explain it they couldn't explain it he never explained it he didn't explain now listen guys this is what I meant you got to read between the lines how long how many times we heard that you got to read between the lines that's how people get their own interpretation of the word oh I read between the lines this is where Peter made his memorial words Lord are we persuaded that you have the word we are persuaded that you have the word of eternal life alone where would we go Peter said God lord we've burned our ship we burn it we got nowhere to go we can't go back if we did want to go back how would we get there we've burnt our only transportation you think Satan's not going to tempt you to go back why can you not go back how can you not go back you have no means of transportation you've burned it he can tempts you with it all you want but you've got no way back we're not without temptation Sons and Daughters God is the ones he is going to attempt vim's the ones he is going to try to say hey look remember remember how you had it back here remember when you went to this church over here how easy it was preacher didn't preach on you that much preacher preached on how God loved you all the time and never told you right or wrong look how easy you had it why don't you go back to that you can look him straight now and say I ain't got no way back I've got no way back Peter says I've destroyed my means of church hopping people got him a little dingy they found him a dinghy somewhere when they rode from one Church to another One Pastor to another pastor says something they don't like they jump in that dinghy and here they go they don't know who the pastor is they don't they they got they have not established any foundation they don't know how to live by faith they don't live by faith if you live by faith you can say I don't understand it but I'm going forward I don't know what tomorrow holds but I'm going forward I don't know about all these Warriors standing on these Cliffs but I'm burning my ship and I'm going ashore foreign Bible says the holy spirit will lead you into all truth didn't say you would look on it with your eyes and read it and you don't have an understanding holy spirit will lead you into all truth that's why we've had so many people left because they're reading the word oh he contradicted himself right here hey Connor ditches this never happened if you read right here he said all these 16 men died and you you can search and they're reading with their own understanding they're looking at things that do not lie upon their Eternal destination whether 16 men were buried in a bridge or not or fell off it's got nothing to do with where I'm going not a thing not a thing [Applause] but people do what they can to avoid persecution trials look at Jonah Jonah Jonah needed a come to meeting with Jesus right Jonah got on a ship he got on the ship it wasn't the ship God made for him so what happened what what the problem with Jonah was he had to have a burial and Resurrection Jonah came up a new man he had to be buried for three days he had to be resurrected on the shore God said this is where I told you to go what happened to Jonah's means of transportation it went back to the Bottom of the Sea he had no way back he had to have a burial at a resurrection that's what we got to have you have to have that new life something gave Jonah a life that he never had he didn't have he didn't have he didn't have that burden for lost souls like we think he's a prophet there's a whole book about him but he didn't have a burden for lost souls he did not have a burden to go save people and that's what he was called to do okay I'm gonna hurry through here because the older I get the bigger these fonts get and more pages I get so it won't be long I'll have one word per page but Brandon said straight is the gate lot didn't think he was going to backslide he went looking towards Sodom where things were easy there's many times we look towards the easy way we all do it I don't care if you have the Holy Ghost or not we like the easy way that does not de-christianize you that does not say you're not saved but long as we're stuck with this Humanity we want it easy I do yeah yeah I do I want it easy but if it ain't Lord give me strength sometimes that's what gets me on my knees quicker than anything when it's going hard there's many times we look towards the easy way I'll join this certain certain Church you see nobody will say anything against it because it's the biggest church in the city the easy way many times we do that when we're wrong remember if you follow Christ you'll be hated by people for all that live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecutions that's what we don't want the only thing about pain that I don't like is that it hurts other than that I've got no problem with it I've got zero problems with it I just don't like it when it hurts that's our problem we got no problem with pain God bring the pain just don't make it hurt we want it easy brother Brown said so many times we want a bed of ease we want to go through life on a bed of ease a bed of roses and sometimes if if that's the way you feel go listen to it it goes to Earth or Nest again it talks about that mother Eagle taking that rabbit fur out it's gonna expose those Thorns to that youngin make him get out make him sore on the on the Wind you'll come by the blood that's the only Avenue that's the only Avenue we're in and you cannot bring no one with you you'll come alone and stand on your own confession and your own faith you'll not ride in on the pastor on your mother's faith you'll come as an individual when you come to God and many times we make those foolish choices I've made a lot of them I made a lot of them I've regretted I made a lot of them that come back later and bit me and I think why in the world that happened and then God quickened to this is why it happened but you did this hey you know we can play this Grace game all we want you can play Grace all you want when you look at the way God deals in Grace he said he who he loveth he chastened he chastens that that you parents you love your kids right I love them so much I'm not going to spank them I love them so much I'm not going to correct them are they ever going to learn anything you're going to make spoiled brats out of them and that's what we become sometimes because we don't take his correction wood becomes full of brats and the more spoiled become the more easy we want it and then guess what we get tossed off the ship yeah I've been tossed off a time or two Philippians 3 13. brother I count not myself to to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind Paul says I'm forgetting that Reaching Forward to the things that were before I pressed toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus look at everything that Paul wanted to forget do you have anything in your life on that level if God forgave Paul for murdering Christians and made him Apostle made him a prophet of that age the first Church age messenger where do your sins lay have you done any worse than that God can't you think God still sees yours maybe that's why we no longer have the Zeal but because we still have these things on our mind because we're still thinking of our past we're still thinking of regrets in our life I wish I'd have done this I wish I'd have done that we have these things in our life we no longer have the Zeal because we're consumed by everything Satan gets you focusing on if you're focused on that that's Satan I think the last the last time I preached here at the church I was talking about that God said there's uh brother Branson there's two forces that work it's either God or Satan it's not it's not you God and Satan if God does not torment God does not torment so if you've got things that just keep tormenting your mind that are bothering you mistakes you've made and you can't get rid of them that's not God that's not God because God will not torment you now God will put something on your conscience that will bother you till you make it right but he won't torment you he'll tell you through the word that's what the word's for right what is this the House of Correction so if we if we can get these things that's burning us down get them off if we can come in here and lay them off and keep them off and then we go out in our work day hopefully somehow some way God can rekindle that Zeal in our life do you still have the same Joy when you come to church when you come sit around the word is when you get ready in Sunday morning and you get up the alarm goes off you're drinking your coffee and your mind are you thinking I can't wait I can't wait I can't wait to get there I can't wait to see so and so but now we sneeze wrong we finned one another the one that you call Brother the one that you call sister and it don't take nothing to offend you where's your Zeal for love for one another we we drive off in the car saying yeah so and so wouldn't even talk to me today blah blah blah run each other down and you claim you're going to spend eternity with them and they with you if you have the real Zeal of God for this word in your heart if it's true and it's from God nothing nothing that Satan puts in your life will hinder it nothing so I urge you tonight that something somehow the Zeal that you once had maybe this ain't for anybody here maybe your Zeal has grown maybe it's for somebody streaming it's for me it's for me I'm to blame I fell short there's times I don't want to come there's times that I look at my failures there's times I look at my mistakes and think why didn't I burn this on the ship I know I've burnt my ship I know I've burned it but guess what I did I pulled some baggage off thought I might need it talk you've all done it we've all done it you've pulled the baggage off the ship with you you know you'll never leave this new land that is the word right You'll Never Leave It you've purposed in your heart I'm going to fight the fight but somehow some way a little bit of package got off the ship with you we forgot to burn it burn it now you still had the fire burn it now don't take it home with you say you'll just you walk out here with it Satan will use it against you you don't have to carry it with you there's many soldiers that went on before Isaac Watts wrote a song called am I a soldier of the Cross many years ago brother Brandon has mentioned it one of the verses says my side be carried to the skies on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seeds I don't want nobody to do my fighting for me hey there's there's times we got to pray for one another yeah it's like I told Brother Homer's Church we're a bunch of white blood cells my wife's whole family they're all nurses except for Phil he wouldn't know what to do if anything happened anyways but white blood cells they're the Warriors in your body right we're white blood cells the Bride is a body sometimes I need you to fight for me sometimes I need you to help me burn the things in my life that I took off the ship you know we we see people that grieve going through battles they've lost a loved one they've got things happening in their life they don't know what to do we don't we don't let them bear that alone why do you we think we turn in prayer requests up here why we're presenting the need before the army of God and saying I need you to help me fight in the testimonies that come come back up here praise reports what armies do after victory they praise they worship they Shout because Satan's been defeated so we're I don't want nobody fighting for me when I can fight I want you to fight with me I want to fight with you but you can't fight my battle I can't fight yours but we can fight them all together we can burn the ships together as we look at the times that we we go through and we'll get on different ships in our life sister Erica is on a ship of cancer right now she can't sell that ship on her own we can help her burn it yeah we help her burn it there's a harbor of healing there's many times during Rough Waters these captains will pull their sails down they would tie their Rudder off they would point it in a certain direction and they would tie that tiller off you point your ship to your Harbor of Deliverance whatever it is in your need in your life young people whatever you're dealing with you point it to the harbor of Deliverance in your life and you tie the rudder off Don't Pull It One Direction in the other direction you point it towards your healing you point it towards your deliverance amen if you've got to row that ship then you row it don't say well there's no wind I'm going to sit here and wait till wind comes around get to rowing give me an ore I'm going to move this ship I'm not going to sit I'm going to get as close to the harbor as I can and if I can jump off and burn it I will you look at all the weapons that Satan's put against us your little ship is being tossed from wave after wave what does the scripture says say about the weapons that's been formed against us they've been formed against you but they will not prosper [Applause] it don't matter they can form all the weapons that he wants he can form them all he wants he can form a million weapons against his bride not one single will prosper because that's what God Said they won't Prosper so we get to to watching Satan forming these weapons and we get we get terrified and we get afraid and we lose faith and we start to doubt because we're watching the weapon be informed we're not even seeing it being used we're seeing it being formed it'll never Prosper why because God said so it's faith that ain't nothing to read between the lines with that it's by faith it'll never prosper no as I was studying this the other day I got to looking read through the fox's book of Martyrs how many has ever read Fox's book of Martyrs you thought you had fights you thought you had it rough I've read it before and I know how many times I had to close it and feel ashamed just feel the shame feel dirty that I complained about this and I complaining about that you're watching brothers and sisters during the Insurrection and stuff they would they would come to him are you a Christian yes I am that would give them chances to recant now some of them we know as we agree they took them to the stake and they burned him alive many of them they tortured before they ever did that they took them to the state they burned a lot they put them on a torture rack I was reading this one I thought a young about our young people when I read this there was a man named nickus they put him on a torture rack he because he professed he was a Christian and as they begin to torture him he recanted he said okay I recant I've denounced my Christianity and true to the word they took him off the rack and as soon as they took him off he died he died there was a 16 year old girl named Denisa somebody's ever read the story of Denisa she's standing in the audience watching she said you miserable rich traded one moment of ease for eternity of Torment and they heard her they said are you a Christian you know what she said yes I am we've got young people right here that I I'll just take my life for would do the very same thing she knew what was coming she said I've burnt my ship you can do whatever you want to me two other Riders have recounted this story of Denisa one was written in 1727. the people doing the torture they gave her to two young men said take her do whatever you want with her ravish her do everything you can so these two men they took Denise at 16 years old into a house for hours they tried to have their way with her could never succeed she fought him for hours they said when Denisa finally passed out could no longer go on they tried in a man clothed in white walked into the room those two men gave their life to Christ they were stoned to death and it's hard for us to get up and go to church if you were there could you match your Zeal with theirs if that was you could you say I could do that you have no idea because you've never been put in that situation but understand this the same God then is the same God today he hasn't changed but their Zeal was so great this is a 16 year old girl which she seen that he had gave in to torture and she was overcome you wanted just a minute of ease from your torture and you traded it for hell read if you go read the thoughts of The Book Of Martyrs there's many men that recanted that minutes later hours later days later unrecated shows God's grace they come back and said I didn't mean what I said do what do what to you to me what you want I just forgot to burn my ship I had to go back and burn it I left it in the shore where's your sitting at can you look at your ship right now can you see a pile of Ashes or do you see these big old luxurious Clipper ship that you're going to sell back to where you come from what's your desire where's your zeal where's your hunger does it move you when you see so saved does it hurt you when you see him leave that's the True Heart of God 's heart is not stale you think God the Bible says that God would that all men be saved and when people come to this message and leave you think God thinks so well they weren't predestinated anyway go read the Rich Young Ruler one more time Jesus for knowledgeable for the foundation of the world knew that Richard was going to turn him down knew it the Bible says then he looked at him and he loved him and said come follow me he offered him anyway he liked his ship too much he likes selling too much there was no way he was going to burn it he said sell all you have come follow me as I was studying this and I don't like putting people on the spot I gotta hurry but if you ever get a chance if you could buy this young man a cup of coffee I urge every one of you go talk about the table Shockley or where his ship's been but the Taylor finally found a Shore to burn his shiple all right brother Taylor you finally find the shore because we get pulled through so many things the devil tells us this is right that's right different things in her life this is right and it never matches up down here it never matches up with that soul you've landed on many many Shores you've probably landed on many islands you've been in different places in your life and something down here just didn't settle right there was no peace there was no light there was no still Small Voice that said this is it but God rich in Mercy no matter what your past mistakes were how you failed how you've done this you've done that he loved you anyway all right you know when I I look at those great generals back then that knew what it was to conquer a land they knew what it was to set their foot on a new land and say this is where I'm staying I'm going to conquer this it ain't going to be easy you think what do you think God what if if God had told the children miserable before they ever left Egypt it's going to be hard you're going to be fighting giants you're going to be fighting this you're going to be doing this you're going to be wandering around for 40 years I wonder how many would actually went how many would said no I'm good I like making bricks with my feet I'll just stay right here these feet were made for bricks not walking right if God told you God tell you how hard it was going to be before you got here no somebody gave you a book gave you a track witness to you at work and there's something that spoke down here it wasn't because it appealed to your mind it wasn't because it appealed to your eyesight it was something that spoke down here a predestinated seed that was put there before the foundation of the world and there came a Time the predestinated time that God said I'm going to water that there's got to be growth if there's no seed there there's a seat of eternal life in there which brother Branham said that was God himself how many times we read read it you become the Perfection of God right it ain't just flesh it's the life amen so I urge you tonight I'm gonna close let's stand I went 50 minutes y'all don't tell brother Donnie I went so long but tonight whatever you're going through wherever your ship is you might be on a ship of depression Satan might be just wearing you out because your son your daughter is lost they need healing they need saving you might have financial problems you might have sickness in your body the doctors don't even know what it is everybody's ship is different and we're using these proverbial ships that they got to burn too we're going to burn the ships young people you're going through things in your life you're going through things in your life that some of us older people never went through we don't know what it's like you fight different battles but God says bring that ship into Harbor and burn it bring it to the harbor of promise this is what I said we're setting sins in your life I don't know what you deal with you might deal with peer pressure you might deal with the lust but pornography I don't know what you deal with God does I urge you leave that ship here tonight don't carry it out them doors don't sell out them doors with the same ship you came in that's about our heads Heavenly Father Lord as I look at my own life so many times Lord I've sailed ships longer than I I knew I should have Lord through your grace through your mercy I've been able to Anchor many a ship Lord set fire to it but that's your grace it's nothing that I did there was no direction of myself that was your grace leading me that was your grace leading your people Lord May the fire of your Holy Spirit tonight father if we're in the ship Lord that we shouldn't be in and we're tossed One Direction another father Lord I pray with all my heart that the fire of the Holy Spirit would light that thing on fire and when we take the new land may we take the promise you said we could have it everywhere our footsteps would land you didn't say every bit of water that we sailed upon was ours you said wherever our feet stepped we would claim as our possession Lord we can't do that while we're floating around in the ship help us father to burn anything Lord that Satan would try to hold against us anything father that he would he would form a weapon of user's word says it won't prosper I pray that you would touch your children here tonight Lord give them strength Lord as they as they leave here today I I pray with all my heart Lord may they not take anything from here Lord that would hinder them tomorrow or next day or another time Lord help us to leave it right here in Jesus name amen if you could I'm going to see if Joel comes saying why should I worry as we can worship him for a minute if you've got time if this was Daylight savings outside it'd still be life but it ain't but I urge
