[0:00] great loss in their family possibly
[0:02] facing another May the spirit of God
[0:04] move forward
[0:05] nor would pray for sister Elaine
[0:07] Burdette today that should be with her
[0:09] brother Tim takes me back just a few
[0:11] minutes ago saying they're giving her
[0:12] fluids and we pray for your mercy to our
[0:15] sister
[0:16] Lord we know there's a lot of sickness
[0:17] going on flu coveted different types of
[0:20] viruses but we believe your God over the
[0:22] viruses God over the flu God over
[0:25] everything
[0:27] speak to us today minister to the needs
[0:30] of your people we ask in the name of the
[0:32] Lord Jesus amen God bless you you may be
[0:35] seated
[0:44] it's hard for me to imagine I have to be
[0:47] honest
[0:50] how that David by this time must have
[0:52] felt
[0:53] we've all fallen short of the glory of
[0:55] God we've all made mistakes
[0:58] I doubt there's a person here today that
[1:00] doesn't have regrets
[1:02] of all kinds of things in life
[1:05] not only of the way we've treated the
[1:08] Lord but of the way we've treated others
[1:10] and maybe things that we've done and
[1:12] said that if we could do it over we
[1:15] certainly would do it over again
[1:17] but I can't say that I've ever stood
[1:20] where David is standing
[1:23] never had a man killed never taken
[1:26] another man's wife and never done all
[1:28] the lying and conniving that David had
[1:31] to do to make this happen
[1:34] and then after it happened
[1:36] apparently he thinks he can be able to
[1:39] go right on and everything will be just
[1:41] fine
[1:42] as a matter of fact the prophet quotes
[1:44] this and he says that David whenever he
[1:47] had taken your eyes wife that David
[1:49] actually thought he could hide it from
[1:53] God
[1:54] which is really amazing to me how anyone
[1:57] can think they could hide anything from
[1:59] God
[2:00] but it shows whenever we backslide and
[2:04] go to getting away from the Lord we may
[2:07] not be doing what a lot of people in the
[2:09] world would do but yet in our heart we
[2:11] just are not loving him the way we used
[2:14] to and not feeling toward him the way we
[2:17] used to and we find ourselves not only
[2:19] feeling that way toward the Lord but
[2:21] toward people and to the church and to
[2:23] his body and all of that so it was a
[2:26] long scenario that had now developed and
[2:30] David has finally his conscience has
[2:33] caught up with his wrong and he's been
[2:36] smitten and you can hear him as he's
[2:39] reaching out to God and he's certainly a
[2:43] Broken Man and he's acknowledging his
[2:45] sin he's acknowledging that he done a
[2:48] terrible terrible wrong many of them
[2:50] actually broke four of the Ten
[2:52] Commandments in doing this and yet
[2:55] somehow the mercy of God was still there
[2:58] for David now we've left him here for
[3:00] for a couple of weeks and I'm sure it's
[3:02] been hard on you all it's been hard on
[3:04] me because he's one of my favorite Bible
[3:06] characters I just have to be honest and
[3:08] say and I used to say I've said it to
[3:10] you before that I thought what grace of
[3:13] God to Bathsheba but actually after
[3:15] preaching this I've thought what grace
[3:17] of God to David
[3:19] so I guess we've all kind of been there
[3:21] to where we look down our nose that
[3:23] people were saying plural so-and-so
[3:25] plural so and so boy it'll be the grace
[3:28] of God if they ever get to heaven won't
[3:30] it but I think the more we look at
[3:32] ourselves the more we realize it'll be
[3:34] the grace of God if you make it it'll be
[3:36] the grace of God if any of us make
[3:39] as far as the words there's none of us
[3:40] of course that are worthy in our natural
[3:43] birth but let us let us resume here in
[3:46] Psalm 51 if you would and let's look in
[3:48] verse 7. David goes on to say Purge me
[3:52] with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me
[3:57] and I shall be wider than snow now I
[4:01] can't say again that I understand why
[4:04] it's taken so long for this guilt to
[4:09] catch up with him but somehow he had
[4:11] hardened his heart he had become
[4:14] indifferent toward the lord and had
[4:16] become indifferent toward wrong in
[4:19] thinking that he would be able to get
[4:21] Bible with this but now it's all kind of
[4:25] caught up with him and he's he's a
[4:27] scriptural man he's a man that still
[4:29] loves the Lord and I hope you understand
[4:31] this he's still a man that is after
[4:34] God's Own Heart
[4:36] and he's a man that God had made a
[4:38] covenant with before this ever happened
[4:41] and even though he's done wrong God will
[4:44] never let that Covenant go
[4:46] so notice he says Purge me with hyssop
[4:50] now this was a common weed it first
[4:52] shows up to us in the book of Exodus
[4:54] when the children of Israel are going to
[4:56] leave the land of Egypt so it was a weed
[4:59] that was very common you didn't have to
[5:01] go to Evergreen to get it you didn't
[5:03] have to go to a special plant shop to be
[5:06] able to get it but it was everywhere so
[5:08] they were to take hyssop they were to
[5:11] dip it and the spill blood and be able
[5:13] to put it over the lentil and the
[5:15] doorpost of their home so they did the
[5:18] same thing with the cleansing of leprosy
[5:22] they also did the same thing in the
[5:25] cleansing of a person who had touched a
[5:28] dead body so David is recognizing that
[5:32] what he has done is a horrible sin so
[5:35] it's associated with deaths It's
[5:38] associated with Leprosy which is sin it
[5:42] is associated was he Angel of Death if
[5:46] God God had not been merciful to David
[5:48] his own judgment would have been
[5:51] pronounced upon him now look at how fast
[5:54] repentance can be able to stand between
[5:58] mercy and Justice because David's own
[6:02] judgment was let the man who has done
[6:05] this when Nathan the prophet told him
[6:07] about the parable and he said let the
[6:09] man who has done this he must surely die
[6:13] and Nathan said you're the man
[6:16] but David repented and repented in such
[6:20] a genuine way that God said to Nathan
[6:24] Nathan to David you shall not surely die
[6:28] but the sword will never leave your
[6:31] house
[6:32] look how fast repentance can be able to
[6:36] spare someone's life I love repentance
[6:39] myself
[6:40] I thank God for it how many still needs
[6:43] it well praise the Lord not everybody
[6:45] well that's good now David is now though
[6:49] at the spot to where he's feeling so
[6:52] saddened he's feeling so heavy and so
[6:57] burdened and it's like he cannot say it
[7:00] enough I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry and
[7:05] we know that when whenever we repent
[7:08] it's not that God requires us to say it
[7:11] over and over and over and over again we
[7:15] don't believe that we have to do Penance
[7:17] we do not believe that we have to say so
[7:20] many Hail Marys and all that sort of
[7:22] thing but when we genuinely do it and do
[7:25] it once as far as God is concerned
[7:29] that's enough
[7:30] but what I'm seeing is a man that
[7:34] recognizes he's done so wrong and he's
[7:37] fell so far remember this is not now a
[7:40] little Shepherd boy which is in his
[7:42] teens but it's a middle-aged man which
[7:46] is the king of Israel
[7:49] so had he been a Shepherd boy hardly
[7:52] nobody would have even known him maybe
[7:54] his mother his father possibly his
[7:56] brothers but now not only does David
[7:59] know it the kingdom knows it the enemy
[8:02] knows it all kinds of people know what
[8:05] this man has done no doubt as he's
[8:08] feeling the layers of his sin he's
[8:12] repenting in different stages repenting
[8:16] to God repenting to his kingdom
[8:18] repenting to his family repenting to
[8:22] Bathsheba remember Bathsheba had no
[8:25] rights and we we have no recording in
[8:28] the scripture that she was actually
[8:30] guilty on any part if she would have
[8:34] refused him he could have absolutely
[8:36] have her kill remember in those days
[8:39] there was nobody above the king as far
[8:43] as the law now we know how it is in our
[8:46] politics today that people think they
[8:48] can do certain things using it by with
[8:50] it and some of them can it depends on
[8:53] how far they are you know the
[8:55] politicians today can get by with things
[8:58] that you and I would try to do we'd be
[9:00] thrown in jail and they'd throw away the
[9:02] key
[9:03] but our politicians do it all the time
[9:06] and because of who they are they can get
[9:08] by with it is that right that's right or
[9:11] they'll have all kind of hearings and
[9:12] nobody ever hardly ever gets thrown in
[9:15] jail but yet David it was the same way
[9:17] in the sense of who's going to penalize
[9:20] him oh but you see there was one that
[9:23] was still above David and that was God
[9:26] and God had a prophet who was not afraid
[9:29] to walk into David's court and condemn
[9:31] the man for the sin that he had done but
[9:35] now the condemnation is no longer
[9:37] necessary we don't find Nathan ever
[9:40] coming back again and reminding him
[9:43] remember remember remember remember
[9:46] it was not necessary now because David's
[9:50] hardened conscience had been awakened By
[9:53] The Sword of the spirit and David was so
[9:57] smitten there wasn't a day went by I
[10:00] dare say there wasn't an hour that went
[10:02] by that he had not all thought about
[10:04] what he had done how could I have done
[10:07] this how could I have stooped so low and
[10:09] we know it's a delicate balance because
[10:11] the Lord wants us truly repent and then
[10:14] the Lord wants us to accept his
[10:17] forgiveness for that but I hope you
[10:19] understand what I'm going to say that
[10:21] myself I worry about people that do
[10:23] terrible wrongs and they just say well
[10:26] I'm sorry and also what I did wrong and
[10:28] I'm okay now that really troubles me
[10:30] because you think do they understand the
[10:33] weight of what they have done do they
[10:35] understand the consequences of what they
[10:37] have done and then on the other hand I
[10:39] worry about people that do wrong and
[10:42] they're just constantly repenting
[10:43] repenting month in month out year in
[10:45] year out you know to me there's got to
[10:48] be a balance in there somewhere that we
[10:50] find that spot to where you know how it
[10:53] is even with your children when they do
[10:55] wrong and you tell them that they're
[10:57] wrong and you correct them and you deal
[11:00] with them however you correct your
[11:01] children and you don't want them being
[11:03] wrong for so long and feeling under that
[11:06] oppression of being wrong that they just
[11:09] become so despondent they don't want to
[11:12] live then you know you've penalized them
[11:14] to such a severe level they don't want
[11:17] to live no more right
[11:19] and it's the same way with the spirit of
[11:21] God he wants us to feel wrong to know
[11:24] that we've done wrong but he wants us to
[11:27] accept that forgiveness and be able to
[11:29] not only allow him to forgive us but for
[11:32] us to forgive ourselves
[11:35] I don't know about you I'm my worst one
[11:38] when it comes to condemning and all that
[11:40] sort of thing if I trespass against many
[11:43] of you you would forgive me it might
[11:45] hurt your feelings and all of that and I
[11:47] would forgive you but for me I'm the
[11:50] worst one oh I just pick I'll pick it I
[11:52] pick it I go on and pick it I won't
[11:54] forgive myself I knew better I should
[11:57] have I should have and I stare say I'm
[11:59] not the only one
[12:01] and David is still under this time is it
[12:05] the wrong time is he at the right stage
[12:07] forgive me I think that David is still
[12:11] in this delicate balance trying to find
[12:15] that spot
[12:17] but David sees the measure of what he's
[12:20] done now remember the way that Nathan
[12:22] likened him he likened it that David was
[12:26] a sheep stealer even though it was uh
[12:29] uriah's wife but it was something that
[12:32] was so dear and David had stolen
[12:35] something that cost him nothing so the
[12:39] way the prophet conveys it he conveys
[12:41] that it was Uriah that took this little
[12:44] sheep and raised it up and nurtured it
[12:47] and fed it and taken care of it and
[12:50] David it cost him nothing at him no
[12:53] investment whatsoever in the sheath but
[12:56] he took something that did not belong to
[12:58] him and this is the way that Nathan sets
[13:01] it forth and God doesn't like sheep
[13:04] stealing no he doesn't whether it's a
[13:06] king or a preacher or whoever it is God
[13:08] has a major problem with it and if
[13:11] you're a Christian you should too but
[13:13] yet the ways that God conveys it was
[13:16] this man had invested so much time and
[13:19] so much labor and so much work in the
[13:21] sheep and David thought nothing of that
[13:24] all David wand wanted was something that
[13:27] would satisfy his passions at the time
[13:29] and he sent her back home she was now
[13:32] defiled so David is going through all of
[13:36] these layers of this sin which had
[13:39] accumulated no doubt it was over a
[13:41] period of time and now it's at that spot
[13:44] to where he's realizing he needs
[13:46] cleansing now he goes on to say in verse
[13:48] 8 make me to hear joy and gladness that
[13:53] the bones which thou has broken May
[13:56] Rejoice now it had been some time since
[14:00] he'd been able to enjoy his joy of the
[14:03] Salvation the Lord had given him unto
[14:06] the Old Testament dispensation so he was
[14:08] depressed he was sad he was weary he was
[14:12] despised on them now they're talking
[14:14] about the sweet psalmist of Israel we're
[14:17] talking about a man that would write
[14:19] songs that we still sing to this day a
[14:23] man that was so inspired and could pick
[14:25] up an instrument and all of a sudden the
[14:27] Lord just come to him and give him words
[14:30] that are so anointed that we Rejoice
[14:33] send them to this very hour is that
[14:35] right but yet even this man which had
[14:38] been so blessed by God no doubt he would
[14:41] pick up his harp and he couldn't play he
[14:44] would pick up and go back and look at
[14:46] the songs that the Lord had given he
[14:47] said oh my I remember those days I
[14:50] remember when I was under his anointing
[14:52] but now he tried to sing and he couldn't
[14:54] write he just put his pen back down he
[14:57] would try to pray oh Lord anoint me oh
[14:59] Lord give me something give me something
[15:01] fresh how many has ever been there
[15:04] and yet he had come to that spot that
[15:06] his Joy was gone and it was as if though
[15:09] David was likening this to bones that
[15:12] had been broken so he was not only
[15:15] dealing with a broken Joy but he was
[15:17] dealing with as it were a broken bone
[15:20] both of you that have had them you know
[15:22] how painful that it can be so it's not
[15:26] only that he was likening it to a bone
[15:28] that was out of joint but one that had
[15:31] been broken notice he says whenever make
[15:33] me to hear joy and gladness now it
[15:36] wasn't that there wasn't happy things
[15:38] around him but it was like he did not
[15:41] have the ability and the capacity to be
[15:45] able to receive them what was it his sin
[15:48] had so taken from him his Joy of loving
[15:51] the Lord and no doubt David was one of
[15:54] the happiest people you'd ever want to
[15:56] be around people must have just loved to
[15:59] be around him and he was conscious would
[16:01] say maybe humming a song or singing or
[16:04] song and just what the Lord had gave him
[16:06] you know blessed be the Lord blessed be
[16:09] his name and blessed be his courts and
[16:12] I'd rather live a day in the house of my
[16:14] God to live a thousand years in sin and
[16:17] people would just marvel to be around
[16:19] him and they was noticing being around
[16:21] David that he was just so quiet he
[16:24] wasn't whistling anymore and he wasn't
[16:26] humming anymore and he wasn't singing
[16:29] anymore and they just noticed he was
[16:31] really down and weary oh my what a sad
[16:36] thing it must have been in the whole
[16:38] Kingdom of Israel as they would talk
[16:41] about him that come into Jerusalem and
[16:43] it was like something had hovered over
[16:45] the entire city and this city was known
[16:48] for its Splendor it was known for its
[16:51] beauty but it was also known because the
[16:53] king that was there was a great harpist
[16:55] and a great singer and no doubt people
[16:57] would come from all over the kingdom
[16:59] just to hear David sing special songs
[17:02] and they would just love to hear frame
[17:04] do a concert and one of his main
[17:06] musicians was a man by the name of my
[17:09] skill and my skill was a very talented
[17:12] guy many of the Psalms are written to
[17:14] different ones and they would take those
[17:16] psalms and their musical instruments or
[17:18] how the people must have destroyed when
[17:21] word would get Out Among the
[17:22] jerusalemites and they'd say David's
[17:25] singing today and David's playing and
[17:27] they said Oh you mean King David himself
[17:30] yes and they'd get all their instruments
[17:32] together and that's set up somewhere in
[17:34] a court or in a park somewhere and David
[17:37] would pick up his harp and he'd go to
[17:38] strumming across through there and
[17:40] people that was oppressed and sad they
[17:43] just begin to feel better and their
[17:46] burdens would get lighter as David was
[17:48] charged taking his finger and remember
[17:50] this was the same anointed man that
[17:53] began to play for King Saul when the
[17:55] spirit of the Lord had left him and the
[17:57] evil spirit troubles Saul and when David
[18:00] but picked up his string instruments and
[18:02] started raking across there that devil
[18:05] would leave him shame on you that don't
[18:07] believe in music and church
[18:09] oh Hallelujah
[18:11] but David would try to reach down and
[18:13] pick up his harp and say I just can't do
[18:16] it I just can't do it and the people
[18:19] that think when are we going to have
[18:21] another concert as we'd say when it's
[18:23] King David going to sing another song oh
[18:26] it's been forever since my skill told us
[18:28] that that King David whether they're
[18:31] still playing or they're still singing
[18:32] and we're asking well where's the king
[18:34] where's the king always really he's
[18:36] really busy and he just got a lot on him
[18:39] right now and he's
[18:41] kind of low
[18:47] David was now
[18:49] feeling
[18:51] bruised and broken
[18:54] notice in verse 9 he says hide thy face
[18:59] from my sins
[19:01] and blot out all
[19:03] uniniquities
[19:06] created me
[19:09] a clean heart o God
[19:12] huh
[19:13] I find this amazing because this man in
[19:16] the Old Testament has a very wonderful
[19:20] perspective
[19:22] of how he's going to have to be changed
[19:26] he can't do it himself
[19:29] no doubt he's done everything that the
[19:32] law would provide for him to get out of
[19:34] this slump that he's in but he just
[19:37] can't do it
[19:39] but he sees there's one way out
[19:43] and that is a new creation
[19:46] create in me listen what he says create
[19:50] in me a clean heart now this is quite an
[19:55] admission
[19:57] it's an admission no doubt that he
[19:59] thought he'd never have to make
[20:01] that David has a heart
[20:05] that is corrupt
[20:07] and vile
[20:09] and wicked
[20:12] no doubt I never thought he would ever
[20:14] be saying such a thing that my heart is
[20:19] not clean
[20:20] my heart is not right before God
[20:27] well you all are quiet this morning
[20:30] create in me
[20:33] a clean heart
[20:36] oh God
[20:38] oh hallelujah it's defile with Sith
[20:43] I'm the great singer of Israel I'm the
[20:45] Great Joy bringer to the camp I'm the
[20:48] Goliath Slayer
[20:50] I'm the bear killer I'm the lion killer
[20:54] but now I ain't got enough joy to even
[20:56] pick up a sword
[20:58] I just feel so low and so despondent
[21:02] God I need your help
[21:04] you think you didn't know it before now
[21:06] he did but it never been to where he is
[21:10] now or maybe some of you are the same
[21:13] place today
[21:14] you've never been quite Where You Are
[21:18] and you say what do I do which way do I
[21:21] go
[21:22] and one of the worst things you can do
[21:24] is go away from him
[21:26] and one of the worst things you can do
[21:28] is go away from church
[21:31] it always amazes me when people need
[21:33] help from the Lord and help from the
[21:36] body and one of the first things Satan
[21:37] will try to do to them is pull them away
[21:40] from the word pull them away from
[21:41] fellowship isolate them and then they go
[21:44] to getting colder and colder and more
[21:47] indifferent
[21:49] you're going to preach with me today
[21:51] now David is actually he must come to
[21:54] the core of his problem he must come to
[21:58] the spot that he's not blaming Bathsheba
[22:01] he's not blaming the man who went and
[22:04] got Bathsheba he's not blaming the
[22:06] captain of the Guard why did you not
[22:08] stop me he must come to the core of the
[22:11] problem that the problem is himself
[22:15] and David realizes even with the New
[22:18] Testament perspective which is marvelous
[22:20] to me because the shedding of the blood
[22:22] of a lamb could never Quicken a soul and
[22:25] make a soul realize how treacherous that
[22:27] he really was he this man had reached a
[22:30] great place under an Old Testament
[22:32] dispensation and he had finally realized
[22:35] that even under the law now remember
[22:37] there was no law there was no sacrifice
[22:41] that accompanied the law that was an
[22:44] atonement for murder
[22:46] now there was a trespass offering there
[22:49] was a peace offering there was all kinds
[22:51] of different offerings designated for
[22:53] different things and there was actually
[22:56] no offering that was given specifically
[22:58] for adultery so if you commit adultery
[23:02] then you get this particular offering
[23:05] and you do this and this and this or if
[23:08] you murder a man you take this offering
[23:10] there was no offer
[23:14] so David said what am I going to do
[23:17] there's no particular offering
[23:19] designated for murder for adultery and I
[23:23] realize unless God changes me I have the
[23:27] potential of doing the same thing again
[23:32] come on let's be honest once you break
[23:34] over and do something wrong it's much
[23:36] easier the next time to do the same
[23:38] thing or worse
[23:41] so David had confronted himself
[23:44] and realize he needed Supernatural help
[23:47] the law couldn't do it the law could not
[23:50] create
[23:51] now David is asking for something that
[23:54] will not be granted for thousands of
[23:57] years but somehow that seed in him knew
[24:00] there's coming today when people will be
[24:03] able to be recreated again
[24:07] so he realizes he cannot clean his heart
[24:10] he cannot change his nature so watch he
[24:13] says renew o my create in me a clean
[24:17] heart and then renew a right Spirit
[24:21] within me which is repair or to renew
[24:26] oneself now once you notice that he's
[24:29] saying this in the state that at one
[24:31] time he did have the right Spirit he had
[24:35] the right attitude and the right love
[24:37] for God but something has happened so
[24:40] he's not asking he's not praying the
[24:42] sinner's prayer he's praying as a
[24:45] backslider I need to be renewed
[24:49] refreshed in the presence of the Lord
[24:52] and then he says renew a right Spirit In
[24:55] Me and the word right it's not in the
[24:58] sense that you and I might think but the
[25:00] word right is to be firm or to be stable
[25:04] to be established to be fixed or
[25:08] enduring now David is praying and asking
[25:11] God to clean him and create within him
[25:15] something that he did not have before
[25:18] and also asking him to give him a
[25:21] stability because he's broken over once
[25:25] and he's afraid he might do it again so
[25:28] he's saying God give me a right Spirit a
[25:32] right attitude an attitude which will be
[25:35] fixed on the foundation of your word
[25:37] that I will never do this again
[25:41] well I hope you understand today that
[25:44] God granted at least this height of this
[25:47] prayer because we have no record David
[25:49] ever did this again
[25:52] so there was something that become
[25:54] established inside of David now
[25:58] literally the translation here right
[26:00] spirit is constantly firm and not
[26:03] yielding to Temptation notice in verse
[26:07] 11 that he says cast me not away
[26:12] from thy presence
[26:14] and take not thy Holy Spirit
[26:18] from me
[26:21] in my mind I wonder
[26:25] was he going back to the days of Saul
[26:29] and did he remember how Saul got in such
[26:33] a terrible State and hey becomes so
[26:36] beside himself
[26:38] that he had a flashback of Saul
[26:41] God don't take your spirit for me
[26:45] don't take your spirit for me the way
[26:47] you did for himself
[26:48] don't take your Holy Spirit from me now
[26:51] remember they did not have it in the Old
[26:54] Testament the way we do by birth
[26:56] but it was an anointing which would come
[26:59] on them
[27:01] remember the Bible speaking about
[27:03] Jeremiah and Ezekiel the prophets and
[27:05] the spirit of the Lord would come upon
[27:07] them but as it came so would it leave it
[27:11] never came in their soul and changed
[27:14] their nature but it would anoint them to
[27:17] write to prophesy to do Mighty works of
[27:20] God and then it would leave them and
[27:23] David saw how it left Saul
[27:26] and his heart is so troubled he's afraid
[27:30] now that God
[27:31] will take it from him
[27:34] oh God
[27:36] cast me not away from thy presence
[27:39] and take not the Holy Spirit
[27:42] from me
[27:44] verse 12 restore unto me
[27:48] the joy
[27:50] not of my salvation
[27:53] but of thy salvation
[27:56] restore unto me a singer a musician a
[28:01] harpist
[28:02] a man that wrote oh such beautiful words
[28:06] I I love to just read his words and just
[28:09] to hear him talk because he was a man
[28:11] that had tapped into a great source of
[28:13] God remember this man never went to
[28:15] college he never graduated from Bible
[28:18] school but he went to Sheep School
[28:21] he went out there to the school of
[28:23] Nature and he was in the presence of God
[28:26] you can tell the man had been divinely
[28:29] touched by the presence of God but
[28:31] somehow this experience had so robbed
[28:34] him of his joy that he just couldn't
[28:36] write no more he couldn't sing no more
[28:38] and even the words no doubt that God had
[28:41] spoke through him he would go back and
[28:43] re-read them and it's like it would just
[28:45] fall on on ground that could not even
[28:48] give birth to it it would no longer
[28:50] moved and he said Lord please restore
[28:52] unto me the joy of thy salvation
[28:57] oh Lord God and uphold me with thy free
[29:02] spirit notice in verse 13
[29:05] then will I teach I love this
[29:09] because he knows God is going to do it
[29:14] notice the way he says it maybe possibly
[29:17] perhaps that he says then will I teach
[29:22] transgressors thy ways now friends
[29:25] that's all he said brother Donnie I've
[29:27] done wrong I've done this or that yes we
[29:29] all have but we've got to have the
[29:31] confidence Lord God I'm asking you to
[29:33] forgive me I'm asking you to restore me
[29:36] I'm asking you God to have mercy on me
[29:39] and when you do because I know you will
[29:43] I will be a witness of your mercy I will
[29:47] be a witness of your grace don't just
[29:50] wallow in your sin and don't say well
[29:53] I've sinned I might as well forget it I
[29:55] might as well turn away don't you do
[29:58] that you confess no God's going to
[30:00] forgive me and when he does I'm going to
[30:03] go among the people and say the Lord can
[30:06] forgive you because he forgave me
[30:12] oh Hallelujah
[30:15] can't you hear it in his voice it's the
[30:19] anticipation of forgiveness
[30:22] and restore Joy
[30:26] it's not yet there
[30:28] but he anticipates it
[30:31] and may I tell you
[30:33] it did come
[30:38] he's vowing to teach others now remember
[30:41] God does not make us sin and God does
[30:45] not lead any of us never will God lead
[30:48] any of us to break his word never I
[30:52] don't care who you are preacher Prophet
[30:53] nobody no but then when we repent and
[30:57] make it right God will take that thing
[31:00] and turn it around and God can use our
[31:03] fall God can use our failures our
[31:06] mistakes and display his grace
[31:09] ever let him
[31:11] I mean seen him do it now notice in
[31:13] verse 15 oh Lord open thou my lips
[31:18] and my mouse
[31:21] showed my mouth shall show forth I
[31:23] praise you imagine brother Jack he
[31:25] couldn't even praise him no more
[31:28] he's in a spot in his life that this man
[31:31] loved to worship this man loved to
[31:34] praise God but now he's so despondent he
[31:37] needs God to even open his mouth
[31:42] and so I could go to church
[31:50] brother lord said yes everybody praise
[31:52] the Lord and it just
[31:54] I ain't got nothing to praise him for
[31:57] well I don't believe that from any of us
[31:59] is the truth
[32:01] but you know what he meant it's just
[32:03] like there was no fountain in there
[32:05] pushing the joy out there was no
[32:08] Fountain it's just repeating words how
[32:10] many in here besides me has ever
[32:12] worshiped the Lord out of routine
[32:15] well I guess me and Harry and brother
[32:17] Bert and just a few more the only guilty
[32:19] ones well you all pray for us you little
[32:21] angels well I have I praise him and I
[32:25] didn't feel like it I've worshiped him
[32:27] whenever I didn't feel like I preached
[32:29] to you time after time when I was sick I
[32:31] couldn't hardly hold my head up I was so
[32:34] weary and so exhausted and just so
[32:36] burdened I didn't feel like walking out
[32:38] the door to even take a text but I done
[32:41] him
[32:42] you've come to church you didn't feel
[32:44] like it ain't that right you worshiped
[32:46] them you didn't feel like it but thank
[32:48] God those times don't last but David was
[32:51] in this time and it seemed like it would
[32:54] never break away
[32:58] oh listen to this verse 16.
[33:01] for thou desirest
[33:04] not sacrifice
[33:07] else else
[33:11] would I give it
[33:12] thou delightest not
[33:15] in burnt offering
[33:18] now he knows the law
[33:20] he knows there's no burnt offering
[33:22] that'll expiate this sin
[33:25] but he does know what it is
[33:27] the sacrifices of God
[33:30] are a broken spirit
[33:33] and a broken and a contrite
[33:37] heart
[33:39] now you realize if they offer the lamb a
[33:41] total of a pigeon whatever more they did
[33:43] if it was not accompanied by a broken
[33:46] spirit and a broken and contrite heart
[33:49] it was worthless
[33:52] oh my when we mess up God wants us to
[33:56] repent yes but not just words
[34:00] he wants us to do it from a broken and a
[34:02] contrite heart and a broken Spirit I'm
[34:05] so wrong Lord
[34:07] oh my the sacrifices of God are a broken
[34:11] Spirit of broken and contrite heart oh
[34:14] God thou Wilt not despise or turn down
[34:19] now as great as the repentance of David
[34:23] is this whole scenario is not changed
[34:28] because David knew how to repent and how
[34:31] many agree with me he did the man knew
[34:34] how to repent the man knew how to make
[34:37] things right with God but that was not
[34:39] the only reason we're going to find a
[34:42] change in the scenario now we're going
[34:43] to get to Bathsheba but I felt like we
[34:45] had to kind of get David saved again
[34:47] before we went on with the blessings of
[34:49] God on him and bathsheba's marriage
[34:52] so God is going to turn this around but
[34:55] it is not just based upon David's
[34:58] ability to repent but it is also tied
[35:02] further back than that it is based on
[35:06] what I told you that the Lord had spoken
[35:07] to me a week before last when I woke up
[35:10] early one morning and I heard the voice
[35:12] of God say the sure mercies of David and
[35:16] I knew there was a scripture in the
[35:18] Bible but I just couldn't recall what it
[35:20] was so I said Lord don't let me forget
[35:22] this because it's about 2 30 or
[35:23] something like that in the morning and
[35:25] I'm where I made it really weird
[35:27] whatever's the last thing on my mind
[35:29] when I go to sleep whenever I wake up
[35:31] it's the first thing that'll be on my
[35:33] mind when I wake up so I committed it to
[35:35] that department in my quick recovery
[35:37] part of my brain and then whenever I
[35:39] woke up about 5 30 or so the next
[35:42] morning sure enough it was still there
[35:43] so I got up and got my phone and typed
[35:45] it in and I found what it was but I
[35:47] still wasn't sure exactly what it was
[35:49] the sure mercies of David
[35:52] now God had made a covenant with with
[35:55] Abraham and God had made of course what
[35:57] we call the adamic Covenant in the
[35:59] Garden of Eden and then after the fall
[36:01] God made another Covenant and God has
[36:04] made covenants all down through the
[36:05] Bible and God made one of course with
[36:07] Abraham and it was a covenant that I
[36:10] will bless your seed but David fit Under
[36:13] The Canopy as all the children of Israel
[36:16] fit under that canopy of the abrahamic
[36:19] Covenant but God on the occasion would
[36:22] pick out certain of those Jews and make
[36:25] a further extension of that Covenant
[36:27] with them said like this he would modify
[36:30] the abrahamic Covenant in a more
[36:34] personal way to that individual now
[36:37] David was one of those individuals now
[36:39] one of the differences between Saul and
[36:42] David was they were both of course of
[36:44] the children of Israel but God never
[36:46] made a covenant with Saul like he did
[36:50] with David
[36:51] so Saul was under the abrahamic Covenant
[36:54] as David was but David was under the
[36:57] abrahamic Covenant but also the davidic
[37:00] Covenant
[37:02] everybody with me so far first Samuel 13
[37:05] 13 and Samuel said to Saul thou Hast
[37:07] done foolishly thouest not kept the
[37:10] Commandment of the Lord thy God which he
[37:12] commanded thee for now with the Lord
[37:14] have established thy kingdom upon Israel
[37:17] forever so now we see that Saul has been
[37:21] given a conditional status by which if
[37:24] he obeys God then God will establish his
[37:28] kingdom forever not the Saul would live
[37:30] forever but that would be of the seed of
[37:33] his body when he would die one of his
[37:35] sons would take him and he would die one
[37:37] of his sons would take it and it would
[37:39] go on for anion or space of time which
[37:41] is what the word forever means so it
[37:43] would go on and on and we know that King
[37:45] Saul actually reigned for 40 years but
[37:48] God knew what Saul would do when you
[37:50] look at Saul Saul was a perfect epitome
[37:53] and a type of the people of Israel at
[37:55] that time remember God did not want them
[37:57] to have a king in the first place and
[37:59] they was rebelling against his prophetic
[38:01] leadership yet through the prophets down
[38:03] through the times is that right so they
[38:06] rejected God and God gave them a leader
[38:10] which matched the way they were now you
[38:13] watch leaders and you'll see how they
[38:15] really are you see the reason our nation
[38:17] is in the state that it is because our
[38:20] leaders are a very annotype of the
[38:23] people that they're ruling so their
[38:25] lives are rebellious they were you know
[38:27] dope heads and this and the other so
[38:28] what are they doing they're passing all
[38:30] these laws or the legalizing marijuana
[38:32] and doing everything why because they've
[38:34] sucked on them cigarettes whenever they
[38:36] was in high school and now they're
[38:38] congressmen and Senators well don't get
[38:40] quiet on me so what is it the leaders
[38:43] reflect the desire of the people you see
[38:46] if the people of this assembly ever get
[38:48] to a spot you don't want truth you don't
[38:50] want righteousness you don't want God's
[38:52] word then God will give you a leader
[38:55] which will match your desire but as long
[38:58] as you want truth and righteousness and
[39:00] Purity God if I die God will raise up an
[39:03] oven he dies God to raise up another as
[39:06] long as you want truth and righteousness
[39:08] and Purity God will always have a man
[39:10] before you that will preach you the
[39:12] truth
[39:13] why well that's just the way God does
[39:15] America wanted people like Abraham
[39:18] Lincoln and James Madison and different
[39:20] ones at that time frame well they wanted
[39:22] Abraham Lincoln today of course not the
[39:25] woke society that killed Abraham Lincoln
[39:27] you wouldn't have to worry about John
[39:28] Wilkes boots they'd get rid of him well
[39:31] praise the Lord so it's the same way
[39:33] with Saul so Saul was the epitome of the
[39:37] people he had a rebellious heart he
[39:39] didn't know how to repent blaming other
[39:41] people that was the way the children of
[39:43] Israel were but when they come to the
[39:45] second generation of the kingship now
[39:47] with David the hearts of many of the
[39:49] children of Israel had now changed so
[39:52] this is why God is searching a man after
[39:55] his own heart why because the people's
[39:58] hearts have changed don't you see why we
[40:00] needed a prophet of the heart now Bible
[40:03] call for Prophet was not a prophet of
[40:05] our heads but a prophet of our hearts
[40:08] behold I will send unto you Elijah the
[40:10] prophet and he shall turn the hearts not
[40:13] the head and if we as message people
[40:16] ever turn this message into a head
[40:18] message guess what a lot of our
[40:19] preachers will be they will be head
[40:22] preachers which is what's going on in
[40:24] our ranks right now that's why they're
[40:26] against the Pentecostal experience
[40:28] they're against emotion and shouting and
[40:30] praising God and that's going to lean in
[40:33] more toward intellectualism why because
[40:36] many of the message people that's what
[40:38] they want but God still got some Holy
[40:40] Ghost anointed men that are preaching a
[40:43] New Birth by the baptism of the Holy
[40:45] Ghost why because we got people that's
[40:48] what they want to hear
[40:50] well praise the Lord
[40:54] now what Saul would have been
[40:56] established forever if
[40:58] he would have been obedient but look at
[41:00] verse 14 but now thy kingdom shall not
[41:04] continue on what basis his disobedience
[41:09] had David had this same Covenant
[41:15] his kingdom would have stopped
[41:22] the Lord hath sought him a man
[41:27] after his own heart
[41:31] and the Lord hath commanded him to be
[41:34] Captain over his people
[41:37] because thou has not kept that which the
[41:40] Lord commanded thee based upon his
[41:44] behavior his actions what he did and the
[41:48] Lord knew that so the Lord had sought
[41:50] him a man
[41:52] which I find this amazing because the
[41:55] Lord sought him a man
[41:57] but he was a boy
[42:00] when others see a Shepherd boy God may
[42:03] see a king
[42:05] whenever people see a male boy God may
[42:08] see a man a valiant Soldier so God
[42:12] sought him a man now notice he's not the
[42:15] epitome of the rebellious the stubborn
[42:17] the hard-headed but he was a man after
[42:20] God's Own Heart read with me in Acts 13
[42:24] 21 and afterwards they desired a king
[42:26] and God gave them Saul the son of Kish a
[42:29] man of the tribe of Benjamin by the
[42:31] space of 40 years and when he had
[42:33] removed him he raised up unto them David
[42:35] to be their King to whom also he gave
[42:38] testimony and said as I have found David
[42:41] the son of Jesse a man after my own
[42:44] heart which shall fulfill
[42:48] all
[42:49] my will
[42:52] oh wait a minute now whoa whoa whoa whoa
[42:56] what about Bathsheba
[42:59] what about Uriah
[43:05] second Samuel 7 16.
[43:08] and that house and thy kingdom God's
[43:11] speaking to David
[43:13] shall be established
[43:15] forever
[43:18] oh
[43:20] I'd say the devil broke out in a cold
[43:22] sweat wouldn't you
[43:25] God never said this
[43:27] to Saul
[43:30] now remember he's already under the
[43:32] abrahamic Covenant but now God is making
[43:34] a covenant in particular God made a
[43:38] covenant with the church for God so
[43:42] loved the world that he gave his only
[43:44] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[43:47] him should not perish but have
[43:49] everlasting life for God sent not his
[43:52] son into the world to condemn the world
[43:53] but that the world through him might be
[43:56] saved that is a Covenant of Grace
[44:00] but God made another Covenant with the
[44:03] bride
[44:05] anyone who wants to be saved can be
[44:07] saved but God made a covenant with her
[44:10] before you ever knew me I foreordained
[44:14] you before the foundation of the world
[44:16] and I have established you as being part
[44:20] of me before the world ever began
[44:24] hallelujah oh praise the Lord thy Throne
[44:29] shall be established forever Psalms 89
[44:33] 1. my skill of Isam the ephrasite I will
[44:40] sing of the mercies of the Lord forever
[44:42] with my mouth so I make known Thy
[44:45] Faithfulness to all generations for I
[44:48] have said Mercy shall be built up
[44:51] forever Thy Faithfulness shall thou
[44:54] establish in the very heavens I have
[44:56] made a covenant with my chosen
[45:00] I have sworn unto David my servant wow
[45:04] so God has got a chosen among the chosen
[45:10] I'm glad to be the chosen but just to be
[45:13] honest with you I'm glad to be the
[45:14] chosen among the chosen
[45:16] some folks are the Frozen among the
[45:18] chosen but I want to be the chosen Among
[45:20] The Chosen no cheer well that's what you
[45:23] get when you get you know six foot
[45:25] icicles in the pulpit and you get
[45:27] refrigerator preachers what do you get
[45:29] ice cubes in the pews
[45:31] well that's what refrigerators do they
[45:33] they make cold church members they make
[45:36] cold church services I'll tell you one
[45:38] thing I I don't want no cold church
[45:40] service myself I'm not looking for ice
[45:43] cubes that you all sit there and sat
[45:45] there like this and never worship God
[45:46] and never move an eyebrow never move
[45:49] your hands and never move nothing and I
[45:51] stand up here and I rotate like this and
[45:53] then I rotate back this way and if
[45:55] somebody brought a microwave to church
[45:57] we'd all be scared to death because it
[45:59] would humble us all down and we would
[46:00] melt in the presence of the microwave
[46:03] we're not looking for a microwave but
[46:05] we're looking for the presence of the
[46:07] pillar of fire with the baptism of the
[46:10] Holy Ghost that'll come in and set us
[46:12] free and heal the sick and baptize with
[46:16] the Holy Ghost and save the Lost
[46:18] Hallelujah and we'll raise the Dead one
[46:22] day and change our mortal bodies
[46:25] [Applause]
[46:33] so naturally that makes refrigerators
[46:35] and ice cubes quite uncomfortable
[46:40] I have made a covenant with my chosen
[46:44] I have sworn unto David now you realize
[46:46] part of these are prophetic in a double
[46:49] way speaking to David
[46:52] but also the Messianic David
[46:58] well let me just go ahead and drop it
[46:59] for you
[47:00] you say Joseph
[47:03] was of the lineage of David
[47:06] but on the line of Solomon
[47:10] and there was a king that was so vile
[47:12] and so rotten
[47:14] that God said never again
[47:18] well I allow one of those seeds
[47:21] to set on my throne
[47:25] but Mary
[47:26] was also of Joseph
[47:29] or of David rather
[47:31] but she come from the Nathan line
[47:35] now Nathan was David and bathsheba's
[47:38] third son
[47:40] named after the prophet
[47:46] Hallelujah
[47:49] so God allows
[47:52] Christ Jesus to come through the Nathan
[47:56] side not the solomonic side
[48:00] no doubt the devil thought when God said
[48:03] that in the Old Testament I have
[48:05] destroyed the Messianic prophecy I have
[48:08] annihilated it because now the son of
[48:12] David can never be born I have destroyed
[48:15] the solomonic view but God had it coming
[48:18] through another side the bride's side
[48:22] whoa
[48:24] Hallelujah he had it covered not through
[48:27] Joseph but through Mary
[48:32] Hallelujah remember she's the fifth
[48:35] woman in the genealogy of Christ written
[48:38] in Matthew Luke records the Joseph side
[48:41] but all Matthew records Mary side the
[48:45] bride's side
[48:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:58] that's what you call sovereignty
[49:02] sovereignty means that God can step in
[49:05] in urgent situations and bring his own
[49:09] word to pass in his own way and nothing
[49:13] can stop it
[49:14] well glory be to God that's the way you
[49:17] and I got saved that's the way you and I
[49:20] got the Holy Ghost that's the way you
[49:21] and I come to the word of the hour
[49:23] that's the way we'll be raptured
[49:26] Divine sovereignty will thus surround
[49:29] the body change
[49:38] I have made a covenant with my chosen
[49:41] I have sworn
[49:43] under David
[49:49] thy seed
[49:51] when I establish forever
[49:54] and build up thy throne
[49:57] to all
[49:59] Generations
[50:07] verse 34. my Covenant will I not break
[50:12] nor alter the thing that has gone out of
[50:15] my lips
[50:16] once I have sworn by my holiness
[50:20] that I will not lie
[50:23] unto David
[50:28] Isaiah 55 3.
[50:31] and climb your ear and come unto me
[50:33] here in your soul shall live
[50:36] and I will make an Everlasting Covenant
[50:38] with you
[50:40] even the sure Mercies
[50:43] of David
[50:45] I will make an Everlasting Covenant with
[50:49] you
[50:49] even the sure Mercies
[50:53] of David and this is after Uriah
[50:58] this is after the incident with
[51:00] Bathsheba
[51:02] how can this continue
[51:04] repentance
[51:07] and a covenant to The Chosen among the
[51:10] chosen
[51:14] you see the loving kindness and the
[51:17] extended mercies to David
[51:20] gives a covenant which can never be
[51:22] altered
[51:23] never
[51:27] it's the Everlasting Covenant
[51:29] notice in Psalms 132 11 the Lord has
[51:33] sworn in truth unto David and he will
[51:35] not turn from it of the fruit of thy
[51:39] body
[51:40] will I set
[51:42] upon thython God God almighty God
[51:46] tells a man
[51:48] from your body I will come
[51:51] and sit on the throne
[51:56] then tell me how many Devils Out of Hell
[51:57] could stop that
[52:00] well let me just go ahead and say I
[52:01] don't care how much David messed up I
[52:03] don't care how many shortcomings David
[52:04] had God but turn the man around now did
[52:07] that mean that he could do whatever he
[52:08] wanted to do absolutely not he paid and
[52:11] he paid for years but that Covenant
[52:13] cannot be broken so is the Covenant with
[52:16] the bride of Christ it is a covenant
[52:18] that's just as Eternal as he is himself
[52:22] Hallelujah
[52:24] all glory to God
[52:27] you see the sure mercies of David
[52:30] are they loving and merciful promises
[52:32] that God will extend down into that
[52:35] Messianic line to establish an
[52:38] everlasting Kingdom that will never end
[52:42] and give peace and happiness to Israel
[52:46] notice in Acts 13 33 speaking about the
[52:50] Lord Jesus being raised from the dead
[52:51] God hath fulfilled the same unto us
[52:54] their children in that he has raised up
[52:56] Jesus again and it is also written in
[52:59] the second Psalm Thou Art my son this
[53:02] day have I begotten thee and as
[53:05] concerning that he raised him up from
[53:07] the dead now no more to return to
[53:09] corruption he sat on this wise
[53:12] I will give you
[53:14] the sure Mercies
[53:16] of David
[53:19] oh
[53:21] so the sure mercies of David from Isaiah
[53:24] 55 3 extended right on down from the Old
[53:27] Testament to the New Testament and when
[53:29] God raised up Christ from the dead the
[53:32] sure mercies of David was continuing on
[53:35] and you know why we're saved today the
[53:37] sure mercies of David not King David of
[53:40] the Old Testament King Jesus of the new
[53:43] but what is it it's through the
[53:45] extension of the son of David of the
[53:48] fruit of his body already he's setting
[53:51] on the throne of our hearts this day
[53:53] through what the sure mercies of David
[53:56] don't you understand as the bride of
[53:58] Christ how could the church ages go into
[54:00] such Darkness they would put him out and
[54:02] he would still be merciful the sure
[54:04] mercies of David but not King David of
[54:07] the Old Testament but the David of lacks
[54:09] chapter 13. I know we save today the
[54:12] show mercies of our David is it any
[54:15] wonder that whenever they come into the
[54:17] City and they needed something they'd
[54:18] cry out oh Jesus thou son of David have
[54:22] mercy on me
[54:23] amen
[54:25] Hallelujah
[54:27] Hallelujah so the sure mercies of David
[54:31] extended over the Seal of Rome
[54:36] when they roll the stone over that grave
[54:38] and put the Signet of Rome
[54:42] God said I will extend the sure mercies
[54:44] of David
[54:46] can you imagine on that third Moon
[54:49] death
[54:51] checked in with Satan
[54:53] Satan checked in with death hey death
[54:57] how is it
[54:58] everything's good
[55:00] well cool
[55:01] our modern terminology we're good
[55:05] no shaking
[55:07] disciples are tore all to pieces
[55:09] the church is divided 47 ways
[55:12] Peter's gone by fish and the others are
[55:14] doing this that and the other we're good
[55:17] Hallelujah
[55:19] but remember God had said of the fruit
[55:21] of thy body while I set upon thy throne
[55:24] and I will extend this your mercies of
[55:27] David unto him
[55:29] but all of a sudden
[55:31] I can see an eyebrow
[55:35] maybe a finger what was it David was
[55:39] waking up
[55:40] Hallelujah he had done took a journey
[55:43] down into hell of course in the form of
[55:46] theophany and he knocked on the door of
[55:48] gate the gates of hell down there
[55:50] preached of the souls that was in prison
[55:51] went over to hell and knocked on the
[55:53] door of hell and Satan come to the door
[55:55] I said ah you have arrived have you he
[55:58] said yes I am here my blood is still hot
[56:01] on Calvary so what I'm glad to see you I
[56:04] thought I got you when I killed Abel I
[56:06] thought I'd got you when I tried to kill
[56:08] them children down there under the reign
[56:10] of pharaoh I thought I got you when I
[56:12] got Jeremiah but now I finally got you
[56:15] Jesus could have come back and said yeah
[56:17] now that you've got me what are you
[56:18] going to do with me because you can't
[56:21] handle what I've got so he reaches
[56:23] inside Hallelujah he reaches insides and
[56:26] jokes the keys off of hell and Satan
[56:29] ain't even got the keys to his own house
[56:32] and Jesus took the keys of death and
[56:35] hell and the grave I'm smoking and
[56:38] marijuana and depression and sadness
[56:40] inside trouble and hardly why the sure
[56:44] mercies of David are extended right up
[56:47] through the resurrection
[56:59] Satan
[57:01] how's it on your side always good
[57:04] he paid me a little visit
[57:06] took the keys
[57:07] that's okay we'll get some more made
[57:11] but he kind of disappeared
[57:13] I ain't seen him in a day or so
[57:17] I'm not and I'm not sure exactly where
[57:19] he went but all I do know was actually
[57:20] left here I heard a bunch of shouting
[57:23] and screaming over in Paradise so I kind
[57:25] of figured he got amongst them Holy
[57:26] Rollers over them they started having
[57:28] Church
[57:30] hallelujah oh that's the way it is when
[57:33] Jesus shows up the prophet said there's
[57:35] always a bunch of noise where Jesus is
[57:40] Oh Glory you imagine knocking on the
[57:43] door and Abraham comes to the door and
[57:46] he opens the door he said Sarah Sarah
[57:48] come look see who it is it's him that
[57:51] come and met us that day and Ezekiel got
[57:53] up and said my lord it's that wheel in
[57:56] the middle of the wheel and then
[57:57] Jeremiah said this and I hear somebody
[58:00] way in the back said make way make way
[58:03] my name is we've had my name is David
[58:09] and said my son is that my lord inside
[58:13] my resurrection I have been waiting
[58:18] Hallelujah
[58:21] glory to God
[58:23] what must God fixing to do extend the
[58:27] sure mercies of David through David
[58:33] oh thank you Lord
[58:36] laughs
[58:37] Hallelujah
[58:43] so I actually finally got him calmed
[58:45] down a little bit
[58:46] they say my children
[58:48] we're going to make a little Whistle
[58:49] Stop
[58:50] I need to stop up and see my young ones
[58:52] up there on the other side
[58:55] Abraham said he said okay if we walk
[58:57] around a little
[58:59] oh sure
[59:00] just go ahead we'll meet again a couple
[59:02] of days
[59:04] so Abraham and Sarah went down through
[59:06] your career
[59:07] you know they could travel like a
[59:08] thought
[59:09] so that thought about being in career in
[59:11] the two that it wasn't a career and then
[59:13] the thing being back about you know
[59:15] Jerusalem it's cool there was it wow
[59:17] what a beautiful land he told me hey did
[59:19] someone says y'all this is something you
[59:21] know go by the cave of Matt Taylor no I
[59:23] don't want to go back there we've been
[59:24] raised from the dead
[59:26] oh what's he doing up there making
[59:28] himself known to his brothers
[59:31] Matthew 27 53.
[59:34] the most bodies of those Saints which
[59:37] slept a rose and entered with him in his
[59:42] resurrection
[59:44] the sure mercies of David went beyond a
[59:48] natural throne it went into hell
[59:52] it went into Paradise
[59:54] and emptied it
[59:58] Paradise has had a For Lease sign on it
[1:00:01] for two thousand years
[1:00:03] nobody else needs to go there Hallelujah
[1:00:06] why the sure mercies of David I once was
[1:00:10] lost but now I'm found how am I found
[1:00:13] the sure mercies of David you was blind
[1:00:16] now you see how the sure mercies of
[1:00:19] David not King David of the Old
[1:00:22] Testament but Jesus David oh thou son of
[1:00:25] David have mercy on me
[1:00:31] ah
[1:00:33] let me share a few more things with the
[1:00:34] former class
[1:00:36] watch this years and years
[1:00:39] even hundreds of years after David is
[1:00:41] gone
[1:00:43] David is the model
[1:00:46] by which kings are judged
[1:00:54] First Kings 11 4 and it came to pass
[1:00:56] when Solomon was old that his wives
[1:00:57] turned away his heart after other gods
[1:01:00] and his heart was not perfect but the
[1:01:02] Lord his God
[1:01:04] that's what's the heart
[1:01:06] of David
[1:01:11] was the king standard
[1:01:16] First Kings 11 6 Solomon did Eve on the
[1:01:19] side of the Lord and went not fully out
[1:01:22] to the Lord
[1:01:23] I steal David his father
[1:01:26] this is after repentance
[1:01:29] for those of you that have done terrible
[1:01:31] wrongs and you feel like you can never
[1:01:32] be the same you can never be restored
[1:01:34] that's alive the devil
[1:01:37] this is after Bathsheba this is after
[1:01:40] Uriah
[1:01:41] why
[1:01:47] First Kings 11 11 wherefore the Lord
[1:01:50] said unto Solomon for as much as this is
[1:01:52] done of thee and thou has not kept my
[1:01:54] Covenant my statutes which I've
[1:01:55] commanded Thee I will surely Rim the
[1:01:57] Kingdom from thee and will give it unto
[1:01:59] thy servant
[1:02:01] notwithstanding in thy days I will not
[1:02:03] do it
[1:02:04] for David
[1:02:06] thy father's sake
[1:02:08] God is still doing things
[1:02:11] because of his friendship with David
[1:02:14] and David ain't even here no more
[1:02:17] wouldn't that be an awesome testimony to
[1:02:19] have
[1:02:20] that you live your life and you complete
[1:02:22] your life and you finish it and you're
[1:02:24] gone in the sixth Dimension and you've
[1:02:26] been gone from the earth for years
[1:02:28] and God is still doing things
[1:02:31] based upon your friendship
[1:02:37] oh
[1:02:41] foreign
[1:02:46] Church the other day hands up our
[1:02:48] praying praying for different folks that
[1:02:50] was sick
[1:02:52] just loving the Lord just worshiping him
[1:02:54] just praising him
[1:02:56] and the spirit of God spoke to me and
[1:02:57] said
[1:02:59] a bride
[1:03:01] stay active
[1:03:04] she has sparked
[1:03:06] of my godhead
[1:03:13] I reacted about like you Lord have mercy
[1:03:19] foreign
[1:03:21] mortar off my hands
[1:03:23] wiped it off on my britches
[1:03:26] got my phone typed in deity in you
[1:03:30] first sermon I find it deity of Jesus
[1:03:33] Christ 1949.
[1:03:36] deity is no longer
[1:03:38] in heaven
[1:03:40] but it's in you
[1:03:42] deity is not in a Manger
[1:03:51] he has a covenant which is this is why
[1:03:53] hell hates you oh hell hated Saul hell
[1:03:56] hey diminutive Kings but can you imagine
[1:03:59] hell hated David
[1:04:03] if he could stop that seed coming
[1:04:05] through David he could stop the Messiah
[1:04:08] if he can stop there being a bride in
[1:04:11] every age there cannot be a rapture
[1:04:15] don't you see the Rapture is not a word
[1:04:16] it's an event concerning people of the
[1:04:19] book
[1:04:20] so if Satan can pull people in every
[1:04:22] generation away from the word and if he
[1:04:24] will not have a bride to present himself
[1:04:26] there's no need in having a rapture
[1:04:29] but he's done I'll notice it's done too
[1:04:31] late
[1:04:33] I'll set this down too late
[1:04:36] hallelujahs don't been declared in the
[1:04:39] world there is going to be a rapture
[1:04:43] hallelujah it's in the future to be
[1:04:46] that's what Believers believe
[1:04:53] oh
[1:04:55] notice this in verse 12 not withstanding
[1:04:57] and thy days I will not do it for David
[1:04:59] thy father's sake but I will Rend it out
[1:05:01] of the hand
[1:05:02] of thy son verse 13 hellbid I will Rend
[1:05:05] away notice how he says that all the
[1:05:08] kingdom but will give One Tribe to thy
[1:05:11] son for David my servant's sake
[1:05:14] for Jerusalem's sake
[1:05:16] which I have chosen verse 34 albeit I
[1:05:19] will not take the whole Kingdom out of
[1:05:21] his hand now notice one king I draw
[1:05:23] another after another isn't it amazing
[1:05:25] that through this davidic line it's like
[1:05:28] Satan bombards him bombards him with
[1:05:31] evil and wickedness why is it Satan
[1:05:34] knows that's the line
[1:05:36] that the Messiah is supposed to come to
[1:05:38] her so he tries to corrupt every one of
[1:05:41] them and nearly done it
[1:05:46] praise the Lord
[1:05:48] go ahead devil your mouse will get out
[1:05:49] your white flag and surrender
[1:05:52] because the end's already been declared
[1:05:54] in this battle and we win
[1:06:00] all right we can read in the back of the
[1:06:04] book we win this war
[1:06:11] how bad I'll now take the whole Kingdom
[1:06:13] out of his hand but I will make him
[1:06:15] Prince all the days of his life for
[1:06:17] David
[1:06:18] my servant's sake
[1:06:20] whom I chose verse 35 but I will take
[1:06:23] the kingdom out of his son's hand and
[1:06:25] will give it to thee even ten tribes
[1:06:28] and unto his son will I give one tribe
[1:06:30] that David my servant
[1:06:33] may have a light
[1:06:35] always before me
[1:06:39] in Jerusalem
[1:06:44] well Satan challenged Billy Graham's
[1:06:46] message no doubt
[1:06:48] no doubt when Oral Roberts started out
[1:06:51] sincere this out the other men these
[1:06:52] other men
[1:06:53] Satan challenged him
[1:06:55] but there ain't never been a challenge
[1:06:57] like against this Malachi full message
[1:07:01] why it's the bride message
[1:07:03] the body change in message but God has
[1:07:05] reserved himself a seed for the Rapture
[1:07:09] which will be a light not only before
[1:07:12] him but before that prophet of Malachi 4
[1:07:15] every preacher that still standing up in
[1:07:17] the pulpit and preaching the truth is a
[1:07:19] light in Johnson City a light down in
[1:07:21] Minden Louisiana a light up in Chicago
[1:07:24] alive in Harare Zimbabwe a lot in Kenya
[1:07:27] a light in Tanzania a lie all around the
[1:07:30] world someone said of one man going
[1:07:31] around now God's got men everywhere
[1:07:33] churches filed up everywhere brothers
[1:07:35] that just talked to someone yesterday
[1:07:36] brother bear called for their intanzania
[1:07:38] talked to his son and right now they're
[1:07:40] going out among the Village People the
[1:07:42] Messiah is the name of them maybe you
[1:07:44] may not know their culture but to write
[1:07:46] down the maasa and they went out and
[1:07:47] drove like eight hours to get out in a
[1:07:49] village of 30 or 40 of them and they've
[1:07:51] received the message of the hour you
[1:07:53] imagine there's a light right out in the
[1:07:55] middle of Tanzania in the middle of King
[1:07:57] you're out in the middle of nowhere
[1:07:59] Hallelujah they ain't got no electricity
[1:08:01] they ain't got no air conditioners Ain't
[1:08:03] Got No 10 television thank God they
[1:08:05] ain't got no internet but somehow
[1:08:07] somebody took the gospel of the end time
[1:08:09] and God's got a light out there in the
[1:08:11] mosamora God's got a light in Johnson
[1:08:13] City and the holiday here God's got a
[1:08:16] light over here over there over there
[1:08:17] over there why because he will not allow
[1:08:20] his word to fall to the crowd he's
[1:08:24] saving the end time word for his
[1:08:27] prophet's sake and for his son's sake
[1:08:30] and for his name
[1:08:40] oh
[1:08:42] foreign
[1:08:46] First Kings 4 7 go tell jeroboam thus
[1:08:48] saith the Lord God of Israel for as much
[1:08:50] as I exalted thee from among the people
[1:08:52] and made thee Prince Over My People
[1:08:54] Israel rent the kingdom away from the
[1:08:57] house of David and gave it to thee yet
[1:08:59] thou Hast not been as my servant David
[1:09:03] who kept my Commandments who followed me
[1:09:06] with all his heart
[1:09:08] to do only
[1:09:11] that which was right
[1:09:14] in mine eyes
[1:09:16] what
[1:09:20] how can God say that
[1:09:22] some of y'all are happy today now ain't
[1:09:24] you we got we got David redeemed y'all
[1:09:26] leave out here shouting
[1:09:28] say praise God I always wanted to meet
[1:09:31] him you'll meet him
[1:09:33] God said he always done that how can God
[1:09:36] say such a thing
[1:09:39] of a repentant believer
[1:09:42] and everlasting
[1:09:46] friends if God had not ordained there
[1:09:49] would not be a a bride
[1:09:53] program said he would be a mighty
[1:09:55] discouraged person if he did not believe
[1:09:57] in election or predestination
[1:09:59] if God had not ordained it this way
[1:10:01] Satan would have absolutely contaminated
[1:10:03] every one of us don't send her look at
[1:10:05] me like you're some self-righteous
[1:10:07] something another look at all of our
[1:10:08] mistakes in our shortcomings I ain't
[1:10:10] talking tom having you as a sinner I'm
[1:10:11] talking about since you got saved
[1:10:13] many of you since you got the Holy Ghost
[1:10:17] why can't he take us
[1:10:19] the same reason that he couldn't
[1:10:22] that day
[1:10:24] right down the road a few miles
[1:10:27] he went
[1:10:29] and created a body and
[1:10:35] put on Humanity
[1:10:41] Gabriel Michael
[1:10:43] and I start walking up the road
[1:10:46] the prophet tells us them is there
[1:10:48] anything too hard for the Lord and tell
[1:10:49] us in 1960 let's just say that Sarah got
[1:10:51] up that day in a bad mood
[1:10:54] there's running out of food for the
[1:10:55] cattle and the water was low
[1:10:57] all kinds of things going on she told
[1:10:59] Abraham she said Abraham I seen miss a
[1:11:02] lot down there the other day why she had
[1:11:04] some of the nicest dresses and she had
[1:11:06] this and that and that that Caravan from
[1:11:08] Hollywood
[1:11:11] Egypt Hollywood the same thing that
[1:11:13] caravanimate they took this nest and I
[1:11:15] want you to look at me I mean here I am
[1:11:17] I've got a lot where I had this old long
[1:11:18] hair and I've got this long dress and
[1:11:20] I've got this and other
[1:11:22] he said little did she know the Lord was
[1:11:25] coming right up the road
[1:11:29] so here he comes and whenever he speaks
[1:11:32] Abraham here said
[1:11:35] what's the voice I've heard all my life
[1:11:39] and Sarah like the bride
[1:11:42] laughed and God said what is your life
[1:11:44] she said I never done it
[1:11:46] you mean call God a liar to his face
[1:11:50] the prophet said why didn't God kill her
[1:11:53] because her her husband had a covenant
[1:11:58] you know how Donnie Reagan ain't done
[1:11:59] dead you know why y'all ain't done dead
[1:12:01] wiped off the Earth because her husband
[1:12:03] has a covenant
[1:12:06] our lord Jesus is our covenant maker and
[1:12:09] our covenant keeper
[1:12:12] don't you love him today
[1:12:15] the sure of mercies of David
[1:12:19] asparagus together
[1:12:23] Heavenly fathers we
[1:12:27] contemplate the things that we've heard
[1:12:28] today
[1:12:31] we're asking you Lord Jesus that you
[1:12:33] would help us
[1:12:35] Lord we have
[1:12:37] all fallen short of your glory so many
[1:12:40] times
[1:12:42] sometimes in the midst of Trials and
[1:12:44] tests we've tried to believe and yet
[1:12:47] fear but overwhelm us and
[1:12:49] we would worry that you wouldn't show up
[1:12:51] or a doctor's report would give us a bad
[1:12:54] scan or a bad test and fear would grip
[1:12:57] our hearts
[1:12:59] but you were merciful to us
[1:13:02] sometimes we act like you've never even
[1:13:04] moved for us before
[1:13:06] and yet you've moved thousands of times
[1:13:08] in our lives
[1:13:10] we thank you for it
[1:13:11] we thank you your forgiveness extends to
[1:13:14] us Lord
[1:13:15] even when we fail to believe
[1:13:17] help us Jesus
[1:13:20] Lord God I pray for those that are here
[1:13:22] present those that have streamed the
[1:13:23] service
[1:13:24] maybe some sick some weary
[1:13:27] maybe Lord there's some that's actually
[1:13:29] find themselves in that state similar to
[1:13:32] David maybe they haven't done what he
[1:13:33] did but
[1:13:35] they just find churches such a burden
[1:13:37] form
[1:13:38] living for you is such a difficult thing
[1:13:42] Lord they don't want to go to hell
[1:13:44] they don't want to be lost
[1:13:46] but they feel like they're acting they
[1:13:49] feel like they're just putting on
[1:13:50] something
[1:13:51] because you're just having to press and
[1:13:53] press
[1:13:55] may they be able to scan and search
[1:13:57] their heart today and say like David did
[1:14:00] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:14:05] Lord God open our ears that we can hear
[1:14:08] Joy
[1:14:09] a preacher can preach until he blew in
[1:14:11] the face as we would say but if our ears
[1:14:14] aren't open to hear those words and
[1:14:16] those quotes and scriptures to lift us
[1:14:18] up it won't do us any good
[1:14:21] help us father would you move among us
[1:14:23] today Lord
[1:14:25] father we pray for those that are sick
[1:14:27] we know have different ones with coveted
[1:14:28] flu various things some Lord fever and
[1:14:32] just so much going around
[1:14:35] God we pray for each of them today
[1:14:37] father God in the name of Jesus
[1:14:40] May the sure mercies of David of the New
[1:14:44] Testament
[1:14:45] be extended to us
[1:14:47] Hallelujah
[1:14:49] we know Lord
[1:14:51] Hallelujah
[1:14:53] Hallelujah
[1:14:56] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:14:59] we know Lord Jesus after the great
[1:15:02] marriage supper
[1:15:04] the bride and the groom have been United
[1:15:06] by an invisible Union we know that but
[1:15:09] one day we will be United physically
[1:15:12] in that we will have a body like yours
[1:15:16] when we finally arrive in that flesh
[1:15:20] glorified flesh
[1:15:23] the product of that Union between the
[1:15:25] bride and the groom
[1:15:27] will be the millennium
[1:15:31] the son of David
[1:15:35] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:39] we know Lord that
[1:15:41] after David repented and made this thing
[1:15:43] as right as he couldn't make it in the
[1:15:45] Old Testament
[1:15:47] then the Bible says David went into his
[1:15:49] wife Bathsheba to comfort her
[1:15:53] and you gave them a son
[1:15:56] and she called his name
[1:15:58] Solomon
[1:16:00] but you renamed him
[1:16:02] and you called him
[1:16:04] Jedediah
[1:16:06] Jedediah
[1:16:09] beloved of the Lord
[1:16:12] he was called five or six different
[1:16:14] titles we know
[1:16:16] in the Old Testament he called himself
[1:16:19] the preacher
[1:16:20] referred to himself as Lemuel
[1:16:24] different names
[1:16:27] titles
[1:16:29] nor do we know
[1:16:31] one day
[1:16:33] after our Union has been consummated
[1:16:36] the son of David will set up his throne
[1:16:39] upon the Earth
[1:16:41] and we will walk out on the ashes of the
[1:16:44] wicked
[1:16:45] the Millennium could not be produced
[1:16:47] after the opening of the seals
[1:16:50] the Millennium could not happen
[1:16:53] after we got the Holy Ghost
[1:16:56] it had to happen after the marriage
[1:16:58] supper of the Lamb
[1:17:02] thank you Lord Jesus Solomon could not
[1:17:05] have been the firstborn
[1:17:07] because she called him the son of her
[1:17:10] vows
[1:17:11] but her first child was born under
[1:17:14] broken vows
[1:17:15] but Solomon was the son of her vows
[1:17:20] glory to God so is the millennium
[1:17:24] the product
[1:17:26] of the vows between the bride and the
[1:17:29] groom
[1:17:30] and the vows you made to the son of
[1:17:32] David in Psalms ask of me for thine
[1:17:35] inheritance the heathen
[1:17:37] and I will give it thee
[1:17:40] and you will set upon the throne of
[1:17:42] David
[1:17:43] and it's awesome to think about you will
[1:17:46] be there the king
[1:17:47] and the Bible tells us in the Old
[1:17:49] Testament that David himself
[1:17:51] will be among us
[1:17:53] a prince
[1:17:56] so the davidic Covenant
[1:17:58] will be lived right out in the
[1:18:00] millennium
[1:18:01] so we'll go up to the throne and be
[1:18:03] worshiping and praising
[1:18:05] and there will come King David
[1:18:08] I'm sure Harry's going to be there and
[1:18:09] all these musicians and all the
[1:18:11] musicians down through time that's
[1:18:12] played for you but boy how they'll want
[1:18:14] to lay down their organs and their
[1:18:15] guitars and their Steals and whatever
[1:18:17] more when little David comes up and says
[1:18:19] Brothers y'all join me here let's play a
[1:18:22] millennium song
[1:18:24] Hallelujah
[1:18:26] Hallelujah
[1:18:28] that old day they'll have to walk away
[1:18:30] from the throne and look back at the
[1:18:32] throne
[1:18:33] and there was set the Lord Jesus in a
[1:18:36] glorified body
[1:18:38] Hallelujah
[1:18:39] and he will be called the son of David
[1:18:42] what an honor
[1:18:44] that David will walk among us
[1:18:47] and we'll go around shaking his hand
[1:18:49] hugging his neck and calling him Prince
[1:18:53] and we'll say David you're going to go
[1:18:54] up to worship the David they say yeah
[1:18:56] let's go out and worship David
[1:18:58] praise the Lord Lord this is not a fairy
[1:19:01] tale
[1:19:02] it's a true reality of your word
[1:19:04] May there not be a one of us missing if
[1:19:08] that day Lord God I pray
[1:19:10] in the name of Jesus
