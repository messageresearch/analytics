actually get ready to go home we believe we come to the house of God toep things about our lives that need to move up a little higher and things that we need to take care of so we can get ready to go home we greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus we welcome you and the visors that we have with us and we're opening our hearts tonight to first service to see what the Lord is going to uh bring for us and brother Josh Bennett will be coming here shortly to speak to us and we just want you to pull on the gift of God uh tomorrow night um all the youths will take up all the front parts and then the older people will'll be a little farther back and then um Friday night we'll be having the banquet which will be over in the fellowship hall that is only for the registered Youth and um those which will be serving of course and then the honored guests that will be there and then uh Saturday night service back here and Sunday morning again so so everyone is welcome especially the Lord Jesus how many come under expectation just to see what God is going to do for us now remember the prophet told us over and over again you get what you expect so if you come and well I don't know I don't know if I get anything well I don't want to be a doomsday guy but you probably won't get much okay because if you don't come expecting but if you come expecting there is no telling what God will do for us while we're gathered together in this time it's a great hour it's a terrible time as far as the world is concerned the darkness that's all around us we can see Israel as they're being surrounded constantly by enemies all the things that are going on there to me they're a perfect parallel of the bride of Christ they're totally surrounded no matter what they do they're the only nation on Earth the only nation that such stringent requirements are laid at their feet they're obligated to feed the people who are trying to destroy them they're obligated to obey other people in the United Nations telling them how to fight a war sort of like we are isn't it amazing how the message folks get under such scrutiny so many videos made about us and so much stuff that's said about us you wonder why well we're the devil's greatest threat that's why it don't take a rocket scientist to figure that out but we come during these days and we trust it'll just be a a holy Time For Us in the presence of God and uh we want you to just come and participate and we just believe in the presence of the Lord will come in such a mighty way maybe we can just sing brother Larry he touched me while brother Josh comes the first service so look around just look around everybody look around go ahead look around turn to your left turn to your right okay now have you seen everybody everybody seen everybody all right so we're not here to look at anybody except for Bear he walks at that door a few minutes you just go ahead and look at him we'll be done with that he you say is that important I'll tell you how important it is brother B tells us in stport that whenever the resurrection takes place that we will be looking around to see who made it it tell something even in glorified bodies how human that we will be and he said he wants perfect worship he wants no distractions of course so we look around and we see everybody we meet our loved ones and then we focus up toward him to be able to worship so you've turned around you've looked at everybody now let's focus up this way I may come with a need a desire a request a petition we believe our lord Jesus is here let's just sing together he touched me I was Shackled by a h [Music] be the Lord of guft want bust a gut on that one one let's sing it together now oh but in the hand of Jesus touch me everybody now thank you Lord and now I am no longer now whatever you have need of just approach him this way oh he touched me thank God he touched me praise the Lord and all the joy that floods my [Music] soul thank you [Music] Jesus touch me and he made me home how he's glad he touched you tonight amen I tell you what one touch from him makes all the difference amen and I'm glad that he can touch me and I'm also glad that know that I can touch him tonight CU he's the high priest that can be touched amen and I believe that we can touch him tonight maybe we could just bow our heads and go to the Lord in a word of prayer Lord Jesus we just thank you so much Lord for your grace and mercy and another opportunity that you give together Lord with uh Believers of like Precious faith and and Lord we count it a great honor Lord to to be gathered here this evening and Lord not just in the presence of one another but Lord to be gathered in your presence Lord because you said where where that two or three are gathered you'd be in the midst and Lord we believe that you're here tonight because you're a God of your word and we know heavens and earth will pass away but your word will never fail and so God we're just asking tonight as we have gathered now and Lord we have sung the songs of Zion and Lord just exactly in the order of the scripture Lord because we know that in in your scriptural order there that when they would go to battle they would send out the musicians and the singers first and Lord then would come the Ark of the Covenant behind and and Lord we know that that's the word and there that's where we're standing now and then the Army would go forth in battle and defeat the enemy so Lord It's a scriptural order that we follow tonight and Lord the musicians and the singers have went forth now but now we're asking that the word would just come and Lord we know that you said you sent your word and you healed the people and we believe that there's a power in that word that can transform every life Lord it could it I believe Lord that as that word Goes Forth the Lost can be saved and Lord the sick can be healed and Supernatural things can be accomplished we believe that with all of our hearts so Lord we're asking that you would just come the author of the book just step down now and Lord you break the bread of life to us tonight Lord I pray you'll just do the preaching and we'll do the hearing and the receiving Lord that's what we desire more than anything so we're just committing ourselves into your hands we surrender Our Lives to to you Lord take this service and use it for your glory in Jesus name amen amen amen if you take your Bibles this evening we'll turn to the book of Hebrews Hebrews the first chapter I just want to say what what an honor it is to be here and we sure love and appreciate you all and appreciate your pastor very much so um you know um one plants a seed another Waters and God gives the increase and so you know if God uh maybe I could just plant a seed tonight and then uh somebody else will water it and but if God don't give the increase then nothing really happened anyway so we're just depending on him tonight Hebrews chapter one in the first verse God who at sunry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as Heath by an inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they For unto which of the Angels said he had anytime Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he say and let all the angels of God worship Him and of the angels He saith who maketh his angels spirits and his Ministers of flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy Throne oh God is forever and ever and a scepter of righteousness is the uh is the scepter of thy kingdom thou Hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and thou Lord in the beginning Hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thine hands they Shall Perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as th a garment and as a Vestor shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and thy years shall not fail but to which of the Angels said he at any any time set on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation may God just add his Blessing to the reading of the word as you're seated this evening I'd like to um speak to you just for a few minutes from that scripture on he who made the worlds and brother brandham said that the book of Hebrews was a very important book he said he actually called it uh Paul's key letter and you know when brother Brown was preaching the Hebrew series there he he uh spoke about how that the Apostle Paul he belied that Paul wrote the book of Hebrews of course there's a lot of debate about that but um but you know as uh Paul was writing this I believe that you'll find in the book of Hebrews that that's where the Shadows of the Old Testament meets the realities of the New Testament because we know that you know every shadow of the Old Testament because before there can be a shadow there has to be first a reality in other words there's got to be something to cast that shadow and and you know sometimes when you see a shadow you you um you may not know exactly what it is although it's uh you know it can resemble the the what's casting the shadow it will have have a resemblance of it but you know the further away the two objects are in other words the the object that is casting the Shadow and the shadow of itself the further away they are it it the you know it may not look exactly the same and you can as you're looking at a shadow you can imagine it to be a lot of things and you know you can come up with a lot of theories of what it might be and even when you're standing in Shadows it can have there can be a lot of fear that goes along with that but theose closer the the object gets to the shadow brother Bram said when it begins to come together see then it becomes to be you you begin to see what it really is and amen because even the shadow will begin to look more like the the actual real object and you know as I look at the Old Testament and you know brother brandom being a prophet uh there he would uh many times he would even take his text out of the Old Testament brother Bram used the Old Testament uh uh you know very uh very much in his ministry because being a prophet he could look at those types and shadows but he could see the reality of the Shadow and the type and and we know that that Christ was the Fulfillment of every shadow and every type every lamb of the Old Testament every sacrifice amen the even the Tabernacle the the furniture in the Tabernacle every bit of that pointed to Jesus Christ amen and he is the Fulfillment of that is that right amen and brother BR would talk about even Hebrews chapter 1 and he said that Hebrews chapter 1 was was uh he said it separated Christ from all the prophets he said it it literally exalted Christ above the angels He said you as you read Hebrews the first chapter which we just read the entire chapter and we see that he was higher than the angels He was given a name above the angels and and and and and Paul would even make a comparison unto which of the Angels ha he set at any time set at my right hand see amen it was separating Christ from the Angels it was and brother Brown said it separated him from all the prophets because God Amen in sunry times and in other words God Amen in sunry times in diverse ways or in various ways spoke unto the fathers by the prophets but in these last days he has spoken unto us by his son amen because see friends I want to tell you there's a lot of people that believe that Jesus was a good man and he was a good man as a matter of fact he was the perfect man amen and many can see him as a good man some believe he was a great teacher he was a great teacher amen some believe that he was a prophet and he was a prophet but I want to tell you he was more than a good man he was more than a good teacher he was more than just a prophet amen he was the god of the prophets amen Amen brother Ram said he was the king of the prophets amen sure he was a prophet but he he amen was more than a prophet amen and so as we look at this we see that that's what's unfolding here in Hebrews chapter 1 it's exalting Christ and I tell you I believe that even this weekend it ought to be the theme of every service should be to exalt Jesus Christ amen not just in special meetings but I believe that every Wednesday night and every time we come together amen the theme of that service would be to lift Jesus up Amen to the highest Place amen it ought to be the theme of our life it ought to be the theme of every song that's sung amen it ought to be to lift Christ up amen above every preacher every Prophet every listen friend every man that's ever lived amen because I tell you amen there is none greater Amen brother Ram said amen it's the greatest of all Revelations is a deity of Christ amen it's the beginning of all Revelations Amen in one place brother B said you can't even get to first base until you get that Revelation see amen so we see that Paul is unfolding this and he says there in the second verse he hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things notice this amen Paul in unfolding this he says whom Heath appointed heir of all things and how many believes that he's speaking of Christ here that Christ was appointed heir of all things now brother brandham would take that in the Hebrew series and he said what is it he said it was an appointment and listen now he was appointed Christ was heir of all things and he said oh how the devil knowed that from the Garden of Eden sea the devil had heard the word there that day in the Judgment of those people because he said as God be to pronounce the Judgment there because you come from the dust you'll return and the woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's head see it was a promised seed listen I think this is amazing because only a prophet could do this Amen brother Brandon would take the appointed heir of Hebrews 1 and tie it all the way back to the appointed seed of Genesis 4 amen and he shows that it was an appointment the appointed heir of all things was the same thing as the appointed seed or what we know as the woman's seed which we know a woman don't have a seed but she would be given a seed is that right and brother BR said that's why Satan constantly watched for that seed see amen he was always trying to destroy that seed he said because when Abel was born he said there you are he said that's the seed and then amen when he killed Abel or his son Cain killed Abel as soon as Abel died amen then Satan said I got the seed he slew it see he said I got it but Abel's death amen see Seth's birth was the resurrection again and watch how they come amen watch what brother R is showing here he's showing that when as soon soon as Cain slew uh uh uh Abel there amen Satan thought that he had stopped the promise of God because he had stopped the seed amen but when Seth was born it represented the resurrection amen and proved amen that that seed line would not be stopped is that right and watch it's exactly according to Genesis 4:25 as the Bible said and Adam knew his wife again and she Beed a son and called his name Seth for God said she or or for for God say she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew amen listen friends and we know that was that was only a representation of Christ is that right how many believes that he was the woman's seed amen and he would be the one that would bruise the head of the serpent amen but see amen Satan was always watching for that seed and brother B would say it he said he thought he had it when he slew amen Abel there and then he thought surely he had it when he killed the prophets and when they killed amen uh H uh you know Isaiah amen he said well I surely got him now amen when they killed the Prophet Jeremiah and on down through and even come to John the Baptist and brother Brown said when they took John and cut his head off amen he said Satan stood there and he said surely I've got it now amen but then amen there stood Jesus Christ amen and John stood there and and he said listen amen I'm not even worthy to take his shoes off amen it was never me it's always been him amen but then they took Christ and let him up gol's hill and and when they nailed him on calvary's tree amen Satan looked at Jesus hanging on the cross amen and he says surely I got him now amen but listen friends amen what he didn't expect amen was a knock on his door amen and Jesus Christ went down into hell amen and he knocked on the door Satan amen and and he took the keys of death Hell In The Grave amen and then he rose on the third day for your justification hallelujah amen amen to prove to the devil amen you have not stopped amen the appointed seed amen you can't stop this seed amen you can't stop this life Hallelujah and let me just tell the devil tonight he couldn't stop it then and he can't stop it now Hallelujah listen V he thought he had the church whipped at the Nan counsil amen when they sold out and traded amen the name of God for amen for Trinity baptism amen and and and he thought he surely had him Whi right there and it went down into the Dark Ages and the seed went back into the ground again but friends up come a a Luther in a Reformation amen but after just a little while amen they denominated that movement amen and it just amen it begin to go right back again and Satan said well I've stopped it again I've killed the movement amen they've denominated amen they took amen the truth of justification but now it's just become a denomination but just ass sure as he thought he had it stopped UPC come Wesley with sanctification amen and the devil amen so amen just begin to work again and they denominated that movement amen but sure as they thought he had to stop then up come pent cost and the restoration the gifts amen and that went along amen but then they denominated that and Satan stood back and said I got him now I've stopped it now I've killed it now but just as sure as he thought he had stopped it amen Malachi Flo come on the scene and God sent you Elijah the prophet Hallelujah to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers amen and a message come Amen to restore back the original Bible truth here we are amen 60 something years later amen amen in 2024 and the devil thinks he's got us whipped now but I want to tell you listen friends amen there a devil amen watch preachers walk away from this message and people that serve God for years and follow this message for years walk away from the message and the devil send him back he said well I got them now but forever one of them that's walking away God's got a young person God's got a teenager amen God's got a backslider that's coming back to the house of God why because you can't stop Hallelujah you can't stop this seed life it's an appointed seed and Christ is an appointed Heir oh I like that he's the appointed heir of all things brother Bram said in the Revelation series Revelations chapter 5 when he's preaching there in part two he said Jesus come in four sons names he said he was the son of David the son of Abraham the son of man and the Son of God we know in dispensation it's we we preaching in three sons name and brother Brown is just showing here that he was the son of David and the son of Abraham he said see because son of as son of David he was heir to the throne he said as son of Abraham he fell heir to Palestine and all this belongs with that he said as the son of man he's air to the Earth he said but as Son of God he's air to All Things hallelujah amen amen as Son of God he's heir to all things now so I want to ask you a question tonight how many believes that Jes Jesus Christ is the heir of all things he's heir to the throne he's heir to Palestine he's heir to the Earth as a son of man amen but as a Son of God he's air to all things ain't that beautiful amen but I got better news than that cuz Paul said in Romans 8 he said as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God hallelujah for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself bear it with us witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then HS Hallelujah and if children then HS come on church amen how many believe that you are Sons and Daughters of God Amen how many of you have a revelation I'm a Child of God amen if we are children of God then we are Heirs of God hallelujah amen and listen as an heir of God Amen we inherit eternal life amen as an heir of God tonight you inherit eternal life I tell you what if that's all we got that would be enough to tear this building down amen if that's the only thing I inherited was eternal life that's enough for me to praise God the rest of my life with everything that's within me to have a revelation in my heart that I cannot die Hallelujah you could listen V if you are born again by the spirit of God and you're a son or daughter of God tonight the prophet of God said you can no more die than God himself there ain't but one form of eternal life and that's Zoe life that's God's life and as an heir of God you're Heir you fall Heir you inherit eternal life but that ain't even the best part of it cuz we're HS of God and Joint hes with Christ Hallelujah if be if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together listen re amen we are Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ you say preacher why is that so powerful because listen amen if I'm a join air with Christ that means I a fellow air with him in other words amen what that is saying is everything that he's air to I'm also air to amen listen I got three children and and and you know and but as their father I can I got a right that as I'm leaving them you know in inheritance and I mean I get the right to will right so you know I can leave one of them uh you know part of my uh possessions I could leave my oldest daughter to the house and I could give my younger daughter you know all the money uh bless her heart all the financial part of it you know and and maybe you know I could think about I'm still praying about this but I might leave my son something a but you know maybe he gets the a couple guns or whatever and I could you know I got a right to do do that and I can give one of them a portion and another one a portion and the other one a little portion but listen that ain't what I'm talking about tonight I'm talking about the Bible says your joint HS with Christ amen he didn't give me healing and and and tell brother Donnie now now brother Donnie you can have peace but you can't have healing and now and he's going to give you know brother Jackie love but but but but but I can't have love and amen and and some of you he's going to give peace but but others can't Happ not that's not what I'm talking about friends listen now he gives us diverse gifts and and different Ministries and things like that amen but the Bible says we are joint HS with Christ Hallelujah so whatever he's air to I'm air to brother I just tell you this amen if Jesus Christ is not everything this Bible says he is then we ought to just close our Bibles and go home cuz we're wasting our time tonight because we we have no inheritance outside of him as a matter of fact we have no relationship to God apart from Jesus Christ we have no promise come on Church we're only the Seed of Abraham through Christ amen none of us have a right to lay claims on him amen as the children of Abraham in the natural well may be somebody here but I know I ain't amen and I just say this tonight the only way that I fall air to anything in this Bible is through Christ alone cuz I'm one of them Gentile dogs that was never worthy of nothing and I didn't even have a place in the economy of God I was so far off but I was brought now by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and by Christ I become the Seed of Abraham and the Bible said I'm a join her with them and he's air of all things so if there's a heaven for him there's a heaven for me Hallelujah if there was a resurrection for him there's a resurrection for me if there's a Rapture for him there's a Rapture for me if there was a glorified body for him there's a glorified body for me Hallelujah and when I see him I'll be like him and have a body like an unto his own glorious body come on church I'm telling you I'm connected

Believers you bunch of bride people you're always exalting yourself and making yourself somebody and amen and separate yourself from the church listen friend we didn't do that he did that Hallelujah my Bible says he hath made us Kings and Priests under our god listen friends it ain't what I did it's what he did and by the way to be an heir you ain't got to work your way into that you just got to be born in the right family that a hallelujah amen being an heir and having an in inheritance amen amen it ain't about amen you deserving it somebody ought to say Amazing Grace tonight How Sweet the Sound amen listen for amen I don't know amen what I did I don't know what he ever saw in me I feel like the prophet tonight he said I was nothing when he found me and I'm still nothing tonight but I'm in his hand Hallelujah and he is the one that chose me I got a right to be happy I'm an heir to it an heir to the throne he said amen amen an heir to the throne an heir of all things not just one all things and everything is under your feet even death is under your feet the grave is under your feet hell is under your feet sin is under your feet everything's under your feet you're an air and you are dead and your life is hidden God through Christ amen you Rose again to eternal life sitting setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Oh My call us anything you want to you call us what you want to say we're crazy if you want to but we're heirs air to what all things then brother Brown said both seen amen both Things Are there the present future and everything else I'm an heir to it Hallelujah I me he's glad to be an heir tonight amen how mean it's thankful to know you're a joint air with Christ amen that's why Satan is that's why Satan hates this bride listen he's still after that seed he was trying to kill it when he killed Abel and he ain't never stopped and he's still after it tonight and I I just want to take this opportunity to tell you that if the devil's after you you ought to praise God if Satan's really amen after you and amen and he's and he's on your Trail I tell you what you ought to just take the moment and just lift your hands say thank you Jesus because I tell you what that's telling you a couple things right there one thing he ain't got you yet because if the devil had you he wouldn't be after you amen but but if he's after you amen that's a good testimony he don't have me yet and if he's after you there's something you got Hallelujah that's the reason why like brother Donnie was just saying a few minutes ago all hell is against this bride amen that's exactly right because you're on your way to the throne that's exactly what he's always deserved yes sir we try to get a little bit further I know it's Wednesday night tonight I said well that's all right I'll leave that off Hebrews chapter 1 again the Bible says by whom also he made the worlds I thought that was uh interesting that it it says worlds plural just it don't say by whom he made the world but the worlds I got to look into that in the Greek word there is actually uh Aon which is where we get the word Eon or eons you know and when we try we're expressing something that's uh even like a space of time or you know we we might would say eons of time which is just something that we really can't put a number on it or you know we can't it's a way of expressing something that is beyond measuring and and and and this is the the word that was used here he made the worlds and I I I got to thinking about that because you know there's been there was the world that was in the before the Andel luian destruction there was the world that was we know that and now there's the world that is and and how many believe there's a world to come oh friends I'm looking forward to that amen but but but but see when Paul Paul was writing this amen he wanted to bring the entire uh uh thing into the scope here that that he didn't just make what you see around you today the Earth you live on and and maybe the the the universe that is known to you but he made the worlds amen by him he made the worlds everything everything that you can see everything you can't see listen friends everything was created by God Amen a and listen amen you know I know they say today they come along and and they're trying to tell us that you know there was a big bang one day and all this just happened listen man I'll tell you what they got more faith than I got I I believe something like that that you know there was just a big explosion and then all this just happened listen friends I I've told my church back home and I told the young people I said you you ain't even got to read a Bible to to to to have evidence that there's a God that there's a Creator just watch walk outside and look around amen just look at your own body amen amen you're amen and and and and how it was made and designed listen everything around us all of creation is screaming to us that there's a Creator and he made all these things the Bible says amen here that the both seen and unseen listen in verse three it says who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power amen not only did he make it he's holding it up watch what David said in Psalms 24 David said the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein for he ha founded it upon the Seas and established it upon the floods Hebrews 11 and3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made by things which do appear John 1 And1 here's the key to it all in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things all things were made by him amen who's he talking about the word listen that's what Paul was saying he was speaking of Christ and he was saying who made the worlds amen Christ but you get in your mind well how did Jesus create everything amen listen and some you know got the idea the Oneness idea amen of the Jesus alone and that you know that that he uh you know that that that's all they can see friends amen but brother Brown said no it couldn't have been that way amen listen we know amen that that that was God Elohim that created amen and it was by his word that he created all things and here's the key of it all that John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God hallelujah and nothing that was made was made without him and then in the 14th verse and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us is that right Colossians 1 Paul writes it this way in verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him amen for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist listen what brother Brown said there in the church age book he said he is the beginning of the creation of God how many knows that that was a in every age brother Brown said Christ revealed a portion of his deity in every age amen that's why amen he would he would uh uh come and he would give the message Amen to that age and he would say amen I am he that holds the Seven Stars in my hands and so on and so forth and every age he was revealing a portion of his deity and in the last age he was was revealed as the beginning of the creation of God he said that's who the Lord Jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than the godhead then the first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that's not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible the words are he is the beginner or the author of the creation of God and now we know for assurity that Jesus is God very God he is the Creator and John 1 and3 all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he is the one of whom it is said in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth also in Exodus 20:11 for in six days God made the the Heaven and the Earth the sea and all that is in them and the and and rested on the seventh day see there is no doubt that he is the Creator and he was the creator of a finished physical creation surely we can see that these words what these words mean now to have any other interpretation would mean that God created God how could God create when he himself is the creator but now he standing in the midst of the church and he stands there revealing who he is to this last days he's called himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride Hallelujah listen friends as the spirit of God came down and created a blood cell and wrapped himself in it and deposited in the womb of a virgin amen amen the prophet of God said amen he is is now creating himself a bride oh I just want to say this tonight amen I'm talking about the God that stepped out on the platform of Eternity and he didn't have nothing in his hand and he spoke and worlds come amen rolling off of his fingertips and he and he created the universe and everything that you see and know was created by this God and he didn't have nothing amen amen no material to work with when he did it brother B said when he created the body of Jesus Christ he didn't have to B no material from nobody to do it he just did it by a spoken word and the prophet of God said that same God is right now creating himself a bride church I tell you this ought to encourage you tonight because you feel like you ain't enough and you think I I just ain't got nothing for God to work with he don't need nothing come on church I said he don't need nothing say well I just ain't got the abilities and I just ain't got the gift and I just ain't good enough listen amen listen for anybody else if I was trying to make something out of you amen that would be very important but God don't need nothing amen he don't he didn't need nothing that you had to offer come on Church he's the Creator he can create love where there ain't no love he can create peace where there ain't no peace he can create Joy where there ain't no joy Hallelujah and he can create a bride right out of the middle of Le hallelujah oh yes sir this is a new creation and the Bible says if any man be in Christ he's a new creation all things have passed away behold All Things become new you believe it Paul said in Ephesians we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ and the good works amen he says again in Ephesians 4:24 and that ye have put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness yes sir in whom also we've obtained an inheritance Ephesians 2:11 being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will Hallelujah aren't you glad you belong to him and the Bible says here again and I'm trying just give me a couple minutes he says that not only did he create all things but in verse three and upholding All Things by the word of his power brother Brown said there's power in his word how many believe that listen friends his word is holding all things up right even right now there's a reason why amen that that Destruction has not happened to this world to this current time it's because you say well you know it's all the peace treaties and these these you know our governments have got together and and they come up with the United Nations and NATO and all this stuff is what's held everything now I listen friends I want to tell you amen there's only one thing that's holding it in his place amen and that's that's God's word amen he keeps the sun in his place the moon in his place the ties in their place he's holding the worlds up he's holding the universe up and I want to tell you something friends it ain't as if you know some kind of you get us some kind of imaginary thing in your mind that you know there's some great God standing where somewhere a a trillion miles away amen and he's standing off and and he's just holding out his hand and he's holding everything's up that's not exactly how it is amen the Bible says he holds it up by the word of his power see amen God is holding these things up listen friends brother Brown again in the church his book he would say these things sayith the faithful and the true witness and I want to show you what I find in the thought of of faithful here you know that we often talk about a great unchanging God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it's as if though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and become a great impersonal God it's as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind a and that way being the cross and then when the death of of Christ has atoned for our sin and his resurrection gave us an Open Door amen God just folded his arms and stood back amen he said it's like we majored in believing in a great Creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation Now I say that's how too many people are are apt to think but that is wrong thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now Hallelujah he is both the Creator and the sustainer according to he or Colossians 1:16 for by him all things were created that are in heaven or that are in Earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist brother Brown said he is a sovereign God and by his own counsel he purposed The Plan of Salvation of his own elect which he fornew come on church I ain't got time to preach on it tonight but I just tell you this brother BR is saying God didn't create all the the whole earth and the world in the universe and just stand back and then say well I'll just see what happens and then God didn't look at the fall of humanity in the Garden of Eden and then make a way back in in a way of Salvation through the cross and the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen and give and then just stand back and say well I'll just see who comes and who won't God Made A Way and then he come and found you and led you to it Hallelujah because when he made the way you were on his mind Hallelujah listen for this he didn't leave it up to you I know a lot of people don't like this kind of preaching but I want to tell you I'm so thankful for the grace of God somebody come along and said all that predestination election y'all preach ain't fair I said you got that right it ain't fair and I'm so glad Hallelujah because if we got what was fair we would every one of us die and go to hell amen but grace and mercy reached down I know what was fair give me Grace Hallelujah say well I I I want to make a decision I want to make a choice and listen friends I believe in the forn knowledge of God and I believe he saw you coming to an altar and I believe if you are predestination or predestinated or rather you will come and you'll repent and you'll weep and cry and beg God to forgive you but the only reason you're doing all that is because he predestinated the seed down on the inside of you Hallelujah he didn't wait until you come to the altar to give you that seed he gave you the seed and that's why you come to the [Music] altar Hallelujah he didn't just make the way and then back up and say I see what they going to do now oh no he's governing in the Affairs of men now come on friends I'll tell you something tonight God ain't up in heaven tonight biting on his fingernails worried about the condition of the world and God's having a nervous breakdown my goodness Iran's attacking Israel and and Russia's in Ukraine and everybody's got the nuclear PES and and and people are leaving the message and and and you know and churches are falling apart and and and you know and brother so and so amen walked away and God knew all that before he ever created anything before he ever spoke anything to his yet before the foundation world he already knew all that was going to happen and allowed it I'm on church I ain't saying that God's the author of all this and that God is doing all this but at the very least you got to admit God has stepped back and pulled his hands off of it and said okay go ahead amen but I tell you why he's doing it amen because because he's got your perfection in mind amen and God knew amen listen friends I want to tell you something tonight God is proving to the devil right now that I'm going to have a bride and she's going to stand with my word and I don't care what you throw on her I don't care how bad it gets I don't care how much sin it is I don't care how deep and s z we are God's word is still going to be true and he's going to have a bride and she's going to overcome Hallelujah listen to me Church you ain't overcoming in the Garden of Eden you're overcoming in Satan's eeden because brother BR said God is going to prove that you are not like Eve Hallelujah this bride will stand well praise God brother Brown said he's a sovereign God by his own counsel he purposed A Plan of Salvation to his own elect which he fornew the son died upon a cross established the means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully executes the will of the father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of all of it all he's in the midst of his church he's a great Creator he's the Savior God Amen he is Faithfully working amongst his own right now as a great Shepherd of the sheep his very existence is for his own he loves them and cares for them His Eye Is ever upon them amen when the word says that your lives are HID with Christ in God it means exactly what it says oh I'm so glad that my God abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to his word he'll back it up he's true to us he'll not lose none of us but will raise us up at the last days I'm glad I'm resting in his faithfulness how many of you can say that tonight listen friends amen if it was up to me I'd been gone a long time ago but it wasn't up to me amen I'm not resting in my faithfulness I'm resting in his faithfulness and it ain't me holding on to him he is holding on to me that's why you're still here tonight I'm I hate to bust your bubble but you ain't here cuz you were better than somebody else and you ain't here because you're smarter than somebody else and you ain't here cuz you're more determined and you ain't here because well you know I had a greater Revelation come on church amen you're here because there's something there's a power that's holding you that's greater than what you are you might as well admit it tonight amen every one of us in here has made a decision sometime another I'm done I quit I ain't going back but the next day the next Sunday rolls around and you just get out of bed and go to church again listen friends it's not because of you it's because of him hallelujah how do people how do people face the things and tragic things in their lives and terrible situations how does how how have you stood as a church these years how has your pastor stood how is you know I've watched families in my church and you know and and we we we had a brother last year passed away and we had been praying and believing and man you know we really just believed and and and and we were believing and pleading with God and his faith was strong and it' been out of church for 20 years and God had brought him back and he had been in church I think probably three or four years and in that time frame he got colon cancer uh he had uh knee replacement surgery and then he ended up with uh uh cancer again just in just in the time that he come back and gave his heart gave his life to God it seemed like his whole world turned upside down and we were just praying and believing in his family and he had he's got a daughter and a son Al in my church and uh three beautiful granddaughters and they're all there and and and and just you know believe in God and and and I thought you know and his faith was so strong and we you know we just really was expecting God to move and and and the brother passed away and you know I said well you know it's a real hit I'm just being honest with you I mean I'm just being honest even as a pastor I thought you know it's just a real hit and you think man I just don't understand but you can't judge God fully and my daughter helps uh his his daughter does Sunday School in the church he passed away on a Saturday night and his daughter come to church Sunday morning whole family she went right in her Sunday school class and sat down with them kids she said everything you know when they start Sunday school first thing they do is give praise reports and prayer requests and she said I got a praise report this morning she said God healed my daddy last night and I want you all to help me thank him for that listen friends I tell you what how what gives people the ability to do things like that it's a power greater than what we have listen friends that's not that that's not us that's not you know well well we're just we're determined people and strong and no friends there's a strength Way Beyond that there something holding us up Lord that that's greater than what we are and I'm so glad tonight that it ain't me holding on to him but he is holding on to me and the same one that's holding up the Sun and holding back the tides and amen the same one that's that's keeping the universe in his position is the same one that's holding me up tonight and I say this in closing as a musicians come tonight amen I got to thinking about it and I thought you know what over there in the Old Testament one time Israel amen uh the ark of the covenant was taken captive by the enemy and the Philistines got a hold of it and they took it down there and they took it into their Temple and they set it before their God and and you know and as they they took that Ark in there and they set it before their God Amen and I thought about this you know there wasn't nobody standing around the ark brother Donnie Amen in the word and there was nobody standing there saying amen that's right you know we're we we're supporting this and we believe this word and we believe this is true amen the word was just there all by myself there was nobody amening it and there was nobody you know jumping up and down and there wasn't nobody saying I believe it I believe it amen but the word all by itself Amen in the presence of that false God Amen they set that at that Ark down and they left and when they come back their God was laying flat on his face hallelujah amen I feel like stopping right there it ain't the point I'm trying to make but I'm just going to make it tonight amen whether you amen the word whether you believe the word amen whether you support the word amen the word is still the word hallelujah whether you believe this message or you don't believe the message it's still the truth and it'll still do exactly what God sent it to do but you know what I think so crazy that bunks went in there and they saw their God laying flat on his face and you know what they did they p picked him up they stood their God back up they picked him up and they went back the next morning and there he was flat on his face again his hands broke off in his face too and I got to thinking about that and I thought oh God I am so glad that I do not serve a God that I created and I want y'all to know something tonight I have never one time had to pick my God up I have never had to prop him up listen friends but I want to tell you this my God has many many times reached down and pick me up Hallelujah I fall down many times but I'm glad I serve a God that can reach down and pick me up I don't got to hold my God up he holds me up Hallelujah because the God that I serve is the true and the Living God he's not a god of my creation he's my Creator Hallelujah he made the worlds amen and he created me and listen for is one of these days and it ain't going to be long that same God by the same way by his word is going to change my body and I'm going to leave here in a Rapture Hallelujah let's stand to our feet tonight amen and let's give God a great hand clap of praise cuz I say he is worthy Hallelujah he made the word girls he's holding them up by his power and he's worthy to be praised

the things that they've gone through and and the thought just come across my mind in this way a lot of people can't serve a god they don't understand but I couldn't serve one I could I think of it yes sir if you understood every move he made and you could understand everything he does and says you mean you could actually serve a god like that that means he's pretty puny cuz everybody I'm looking at tonight is pretty uny including me praise the Lord he is so great and so wonderful and so awesome how in the world could we ever understand everything about him until we get there and still through eternity he will be revealing himself but he lets us understand what we need to understand and the rest of it he'll take care of by and by Praise the Lord oh it's been awesome to be here tonight thank you so much for coming thank you for participating in the service um Brother Scott needs as many young men that are able to come directly to the fellowship hall to help roll out carpet and set up
