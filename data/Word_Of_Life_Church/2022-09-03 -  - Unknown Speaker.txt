I'm redeemed [Applause] praise the Lord for that not who I used to be First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11. I'd like to read verses 11 through verses 15. I'm sure that many of you probably heard that there's quite a powerful storm I guess heading up toward Delaware Maryland New York lots of those places and brother Robert Marrero from New York had contacted me earlier this morning certainly request in prayer that the Lord would be mindful of them New York has shut down all the transit system the buses Subways and all that sort of thing so sounds like it might be a terrible terrible thing it'll be hidden for those people so we certainly once remember them today in prayer brother Robert wanted me to tell you that he misses you all so much I certainly appreciate our brother let's read together for what man knoweth the things of a man's safest Spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man listen to this now receiveth not the things of the spirit of God now bring at your attention again Paul did not say that the natural man cannot receive things of the word of God but he cannot receive the things of the spirit of God many many theologians are nothing but natural men many people that go to church are just natural people that's all they are and never say many things from the word of God but this is only for those who are Spirit-filled of course the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual I wonder if I would ask you this morning how many of you could Define for me the biblical definition of being spiritual I wonder how many of you could give it to me as far as really what's spiritual now not your opinion but really what the Bible says is a spiritual person you might be surprised it might be surprised at the real meaning of it actually it means to be governed by the spirit of God but we would tend to thank someone as spiritual someone who shouts a lot is extremely emotional or the Lord told me this well the Lord told me that and the Lord and I'm wondering I'm thinking you know what it's no wonder he don't tell me much because he's spending all his time talking with them [Music] but that's not the identification of a spiritual person a spiritual person is one who is governed by God which means their temper their anger lust all those things God is there to help govern that they may not be one that a lot of people would even identify as being spiritual but they're under control Divine control they may have a furnace inside of them that boy like a temper or it could but they're so controlled by God hardly nobody ever even knows it's there that's a spiritual person grabs all the chandeliers and swings around like a monkey they may not be the ones that hollers the loudest but you know what they're governed by the spirit of God I wonder do we know what spiritual is friends very good until we look at most of your face that this is not what you thought but notice this he that is spiritual judge us all things so a man or woman boy or girl that is governed by the spirit of God they judge all things now I'm not going to you're an apple hear a serpent say you're Brian no no they're judging things around them they're judging conversations or judging where they go what they do how they behave now notice why he that a spiritual judge us all things yet he himself is judged of no man now don't don't let me stumble you just right off the get-go but actually this this discernment is more important in your life than every discernment that you'll ever hear on brother Ben's tapes because all those discernments as wonderful as they were they were but really don't have anything to do with you and I and the way we live now it's wonderful to hear him call people out and tell them their name and how many steps goes up to the porch I'm that's it's overwhelming but that don't make you spiritual or me we rejoice in that a lot of folks in the message you take that away from them I'm not sure what they would do but the spiritual discernment that a real Christian has this is one sign that you are truly a child of God man I laugh let's pray together let's ask God's blessings on the word Heavenly Father we love you today we're so thankful Lord Jesus for your great word I so Marvel Lord when I read it and then all of a sudden you just like click a light on and it just opens up to us we know it's when it transforms from logos to Rima where it's actually made present tense to where we are how we thank you for the historical events that have been written down on the pages of the Bible how we thank you Father for the countless of Miracles and things that you've done down Through the Ages thousands of years we thank you for the tapes that you've been able to allow to be preserved for us we're the only people only people in every Church age that's able to actually hear the voice of their messenger after he was gone from the earth the people in Paul's day once Paul was gone none of the second generation people ever heard that voice Luther Wesley on down and on down but you desire you decided and desired that we would be able to hear the prophet messenger's voice many many years even after he left the Earth and we're thankful for that Lord Jesus but then God we ask today that you would help us that we lord would want and desire to live in a world of reality when your presence is just as real with us today as it was then so speak to us today father in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated so enjoyed the service last night didn't you amen appreciate the minister of the word from the brother Daryl and also the communion service and certainly enjoyed it with all of her hearts I'd like to speak to you today on spiritually discerned discernment scares a lot of folks because they're afraid that you're going to try to call somebody out and tell them what their name is or something like that but we know that there's only one of those actually given to a generation but yet spiritual discernment actually belongs to every Holy Ghost Field child of God it doesn't mean that you'll go out and oh you know I feel something uh that's close to a witch to me that's a medium or somebody like that but really discernment is something that leads Our Lives something that guides us something that keeps us from trouble I believe that if we would be more sensitive to the discerner that lives in our hearts it would save us a lot of difficulty that we go through unnecessarily and simply because we try to use our own reasoning or our own understanding and we try to live a Christian Life from the psychological effect instead of the pneumatic effect which is the spirit given life and we we tend to lean more to toward the intelligence or the mind or the spirit realm as we looked at it last week by which we think of things and we look at things and we psychologically deduct those things and we put them together and we'll put a row over here and a row over there and a row over here and then we try to psychologically look at that and think well what would be the best and how should I do this and that and you realize if Abraham would have done that he'd never believe God Isaac Jacob all the rest of them never believe God if they would have put everything all the pros and the cons on the psychological lists they would have never believed God the way they did so Faith many times will call us beyond the sense of our own reasoning of our own intellect and yet there is a realm by which God of course uses the psyche the the intellectual part and we know that that God designed the human being thus so it would have that as long as we're Immortal we need it and even in our spirit is the realm of contact by which the spirit of God in brother Branham Discerning people's lives and I realize that many people today are trying to change the gifts that brother Branham had and saying that it was not actually a prophetic gift of discernment but it was simply a word of knowledge uh that way they they take away the prophetic office from Brother Branham and say really brother Branham wasn't a prophet he was just displaying the word of knowledge or the word of wisdom but I would like to find the definition of that word of knowledge or That Word of Wisdom in the scripture in the way they identified you'll not find the New Testament word of knowledge or Word of Wisdom being identified as a prophetic gift you find it from the Old Testament down through the new a prophetic gift was totally different than a word of knowledge or a Word of Wisdom a word of knowledge or a word of wisdom is exactly what it says it is a word of knowledge or a Word of Wisdom it is not a vision by which you see your life as a child 20 years old 30 years old that is not a word of knowledge that is anti-scriptural it takes a prophet of God to be able to break into that realm that is not a gift of knowledge it is not a gift of wisdom it is a prophetic gift now in that none of us here none of us here will ever have that I myself don't even want that that's given to a prophet and a generation one in a generation now do we have discernment truly I believe every holy ghost filled child of God does and God deals with me and discernment he should deal with you and discernment but yet I'm not I'm not supposed to stand up here and say somebody here today has got a back trouble oh Lord they would be all kinds of people I'm sure uh somebody's got a burden I feel a pain well is that mine or yours could be either or you know somebody here said today's got all kinds of oh there's somebody out in the southwest and I get sick of my stomach whenever you see all that stuff and it's absolutely impersonation is all that it is but yet the discernment that we really need in our life is not that you know brother I feel something oh I I feel like you're fixing to go through something I ain't got time for all that trash the discernment I need is something to help me to live a better Christian Life that will endow me with the ability to discern to examine to investigate to look at right and wrong and to be able to look at something from an inside life that Satan is laying a snare for me or trap and you know that a snare or a trap must be laid if you're going to lay it for an animal if you're going to laugh or whatever that it is a rabbit or a or some type of African animal you want to lay that snare or that trap in such a way you want to pick a setting by which that animal is very comfortable in a snare many times as a string or a wire or a rope and much illegal in the United States in many places but yet overseas still legal so they will go in and they will put a snare in a certain spot where they are this animal is familiar with under a feeding tree or an area by which the animal will feed and then they do not put a sign up this is a snare I am looking for an anteater this is a snare and red lights are everywhere this is a snake air that's not the way the devil lays them for you either but they'll put a wire in there or a strong rope and they will put it in and cover it over with leaves and they want to put everything around whether it looks like knows him and has been there where there's no natural disturbance to the foliage or to the botany life that's around it and that animal will come in just unsuspicious totally unanoi of what's going on and all of a sudden he steps in there and he's caught in the snare and you know the same way with with us as Mortals that the devil wants to lay snares in front of us and he wants to camouflage it with natural things of life or things that we're accustomed with or comfortable with he'll never put up a flashing light he'll never put up something to alarm you he'll never put up something to scare you away from that snare but he'll always hide it in a natural comfortable surrounding that you feel very comfortable with then you move in you're moving closer and closer to whatever it is and the next thing you know you're hung upside down with your leg and there you're hung now what is that that is a snare there but what if we had the ability by the spirit of God that something was given to us and we would look at our natural eye and seem like nothing is moved nothing is out of place every leaf is exactly right in our life every saint oh my our life is in such Harmony it's never been better but all of a sudden we feel from within us a warning a buzzer a red light whatever you want to call it and you just feel something have you ever been there well you just feel something is just not right now you think what is that well it's not your spirit per se because you're spiritless imagination love conscious memory reason so there's no reason for it to tap into any of those aspects to give you a warning it's not your body because cities feel smelling here you're looking around and you respond I don't see anything I don't see anything any different but it would be something by which you would be classified in God's eyes as being spiritual or governed by the spirit and all of a sudden everything seems normal it seems natural and something from within you a Bowser goes off and you feel the strange peculiar warning and you begin to step back then what do you do nature from the from the soul then the spirit becomes alarmed and then the spirit will become on high alert and what does it do then it sends out the frequency or the message to the body to the Flesh and then the eyes go to looking around and the ears become more acute and more sensitive and you're listening and you're watching and why because from the inside to the inside to the outside you have now been worn and you have been given something by the spirit of God that helps you to discern there's something about this situation that just ain't right now I'm convinced friends that many of the things that you and I go through the spirit of God is there and he's always so close and he's always so sensitive to warn us and I can recall many many things in my life when I've made mistakes or got in trouble and it's when I simply overrode that little feeling if you want to call it that way or that little still Small Voice how many can relate to what I'm saying that little something that you just overrode it and yet you went on anyway now it was something it was a snare laid before you maybe it's a boy just going with her a girl or whatever mourn you felt a funny feeling even before you committed to become engaged or married to that individual you felt really really strange and then when you do and your marriage winds up and shambles then you want to blame God don't blame my daddy for stuff you don't do don't listen to yourself I do not believe God will lead a daughter or a son and to a horrible terrible marriage and not warn them he'll warn them from the pulpit he'll warn them as they listen to a tape he'll to warn them in that little still Small Voice in their heart but many girls and boys as well they want to leave home they want to get out on their own and they override that don't get quiet on me already they override that something instead of following the spirit of God so don't blame God for you'll mess up [Applause] but the natural man that does not have this ability now I'm not saying that of course natural unconverted people are not accessible to the spirit realm because they are because they have a Pneumatic or a numerous area of their life which is the spirit realm but yet they are not governed by that realm there is a great difference and being a spiritual being and being governed from the soul by the spirit of God every human being has a spirit so therefore they are able to be able to be contacted by Angels by the spirit of God or by demons or by Satan that makes us Immortal of course but that does not mean that they are governed from their soul now every sinner is not demon possessed listen to me carefully every sinner is not demon possessed they are unconverted they're not born again but it doesn't mean that every sinner has a devil that inhabits their soul and governs their soul now they're unconverted so that makes them Satan's property but there are some people who were actually demon possessed but not every sinner is there are some Christians that are not Holy Ghost possessed they are Christians and they love the Lord and they have been saved but they're not possessed and governed by the Holy Ghost you understand now are they Christians they are because they have accepted uh you know as far as they know all the things that they know many of them have accepted and they have applied are they saved are they Christians yes I would say they are all the Holy Ghost still are they truly born again no not unless they are governed from the soul by the Holy Ghost now will they will they be more prone then to making more natural mistakes because they follow the newness of their their Realms sure they will but the Holy Ghost Field that once they are governed by that and they learn they are governed by it and they learn that that Holy Ghost does not want them to spend most of their life repenting for wrongdoing maybe I'll look at it all together wrong but to me it's a greater Victory if the Lord can avoid me of going into that snare than it is for me to walk into that snare and why while I'm hanging upside down by my leg I say Lord I'm sorry I'm hanging upside down by my leg will you forgive me and would you send the preacher to cut me down out of this tree now maybe you think that brings honor and glory to God but to me I would rather rather be able to walk around that snare and get on the other side and make fun of the devil that's what I'd rather do I mean I've been upside down enough hanging by my leg you understand what I'm talking about I've been called in many snares but to me I'd rather walk around them snares than be caught in them snares now there's only one way that we can do that and that is to be led by the spirit of God I want you to notice that Paul in verse 14 he says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God now the word natural goes into the spiritual part as well but watch how he says that it's such a which is sensual or belonging to breasts now this is the natural man that belongs to breath the principle of animal life which men have in common with brutes no wonder brother man said you'd take the Holy Ghost off of a man who's lower than an animal in common with Bruce the sensuous nature with its subjection to appetite and passion the animal man now the word natural also denotes of course the opposite of spiritual notice how he says this but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him so the natural man is opposite to the spiritual myth so the natural man is something that we're all born into this sensual natural nature that we're born into by the first birth and we do not have the ability to understand the things of the spirit of God yet God breaks the gospel down in such a simple way that the natural unconverted man can at least understand the introduction into the gospel now the gospel is like the doorway that we're outside the doorway of God we're outside the doorway of eternal light and yet there's no way for us to understand it it's mysterious it holds many things on the inside yet God will introduce the gospel as if it were these two doors right here that God but let the gospel be preached and a sinner setting there that does not have the ability to understand the Deep things of God because you've got to be part of family to do that but yet God would have the gospel introduced in Simplicity in such a way that a sinner a person that cannot understand great things they would be able to hear it and peer into the door and say oh my I need to change my life I need to be a better person I need to be one what the this this gospel now it's not about the great introduction of the great deep things of God it's helping them see there is a better way it's helping them see that they need to change their life but they're still not capable of understanding the things of God yet now many come through that door and they enter into the doors to the knowledge of the gospel and they accept the gospel they go on many of it to accept the message of the hour and then they want to go on and on and on with God and yet they never go any farther into the spirit realm to where the Holy Ghost governs them that every day of their life I don't know about you I don't want to just be on Sunday morning I don't want to have a Sunday Holy Ghost I want to have a Monday Holy Ghost and a Tuesday holy ghost man I need the Holy Ghost every hour of the day I want him to help me avoid situations and help me to leave me and guide me so that I can actually be governed that I can be a spiritually discerned Christian that I can walk every day of my life and whenever I'm just walking through lows or whatever more and I feel a peculiar feeling and I think Lord what is it I want to be so sensitive to the spirit of God that he would warn me of something before me if something behind me of whatever you understand what I'm saying actually I want to be a Mystic I'll let you wonder what that means now watch then it denotes those that are governed and influenced by the spirit of God so the natural man cannot be now can the natural man be anointed he can't can the natural man feel the spirit of God I wonder how many thousands of people have come through this church since it's been built years and years ago when it's over on Rolling Hill and came here wherever your foundation was I wonder how many people have come on this Hillside that if such and heard the gospel some of them cried some of them sit on the back down mother grabbed to hold the back of Dimension the spirit of God was moving on them and they wouldn't give how many people have say or thousands of them have come through these doors there's been literally hundreds that have come to these doors since I've been here as a pastor how many of them have felt the spirit of God since the spirit of God and knew there was something about it yet they never submitted to it can the natural man sense that he can but he cannot comprehend and understand the Deep heart secrets of God to him it doesn't make sense he looks at it he said I don't understand why do you have to do that and why can't you do this how come you have to address that what is it it's the natural man trying to understand the heart of God and Paul says one man can know another man unless it's the spirit in that man so he says the Holy Ghost is the same way now notice he says notice in this the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness absolute foolishness to the Natural man he cannot comprehend them he does not understand them he has no ability to comprehend they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned now notice discernment right so the natural man cannot discern but the natural man will try to reason and figure out and read and compare this to this and this to this so if you search and say the message he'll go to this website and that one and that one and that one and when he gets all done he mixes it all up together he's more confused than it was before why because it is the natural man that's why folks can't discern where we are posts don't know what's right and wrong no more come on children folks don't know what church they should go to they don't not even sure if they should go to church why because they don't have spiritual discernment they do not have the ability and they're trying to discern by listening to tapes or trying to discern by going to church you can only discern when the discerner lives in you all right now watch this Paul says neither can he knows them because they are spiritually discerned now look at this word it's it's used several times in spirit and spiritual and spiritually but it comes from the same group word Greek word rather and here it's pneumaticus which is spiritual by the aid of the Holy Ghost now there are certain things that the written word the logos declares for us to do and not do and there's other things it does not say there are things that the tapes were able to go and say well what brother say about this and this and this and this but there are certain things God did not have him to say face it every aspect of your life is not on the tapes every aspect of your life is not necessarily written in this Bible those going to be things you're going to face things you're going to go through things that you're going to face in life that you're not going to be able to find a quote nor a scripture hold on the Spirit Led don't even need it you don't have to have a quote and a scripture for everything you do because the pneumaticus of God will lead you if you will allow him now God gives us a principle understanding and lays it out in the logos why do you say why would he do that he wanted to do it that way he wanted this walk to be intimate he wanted it to be personal he didn't want it to be cold and formal he could have handed you a book of your life and tomorrow tomorrow you're going to the dentist and do this and the next day do that and the next day and you could have just said in okay this week what am I supposed to do all right there's going to be a trap and okay I'll memorize this and that way I'll do this and if you would be a robot you'd be like software to be programmed in you and then you'd oh God I love you oh God I love you I'm going to church I'm going to read the Bible now God don't want you to be a robot he don't want to marry a robot he wants to marry a person he could have handed you your entire life and said watch this and that but instead he gave you that which was necessary and essential know in the form of logos then out of that he would Quicken it would become Rhema other things you couldn't find it not even written at all because he reserved that especially for those intimate times between you and him let me tell your business brother something I ain't no businessman okay but I believe your business Brothers could have avoided a lot of your pitfalls in your business if you'd be led to the spirit of God instead of LED by the market because remember who controls all this money and all these markets out here he does he'll get you spending and making all kinds of things and then when he gets you out oh my what's he do he drops the bottom and there you're hung you know how many of your brothers got there because she was not LED of the spirit of God she was led by greed oh Jesus [Music] there ain't no way the spirit of God but led some of you all into the financial mess you're in if you'd have waited on him come on that's your son get caught I'm trying my best to help you today [Applause] I'm talking about the Holy Ghost remember this all this out here is owned by the Devil he's the one who motivates this and that and the other all politics all government all the money the whole thing is controlled by him and we've got to live in this world for sure but the Holy Ghost can maneuver you around the Trap Of The Devil business Brothers if you'll pray and say Lord help me to make business decisions that are best for my company and best for you and best for my family and for the kingdom of God foreign is we become so confident in our own abilities I don't need to pray about trading cars I don't need to pray about this and that and the other well you better he'll help you I got my eye years and years ago I never could not afford a new car but years ago I got to a place where payments was all pretty good and I was able to buy one so I went out I just picked out what I wanted I thought man I'll just buy whatever I want living down in Kentucky at the time I didn't pray about it let's just waiting a lot of y'all live your life anyway so you can relate to that perfectly the Lord was fixing to teach me quite a lesson now I knew you could get lemons and used cars because I'd sucked a lot of lemonade out of them but I didn't quite realize you could get a lemon in a brand new one so I bought this pretty van for us to travel in you know traveling to back in Pentecost and going up and down the road to man it was so pretty and it was sharp and it was nice and it was comfortable and it was a lemon now I'm telling you what we didn't have it but a week and this went wrong and that went wrong and another went wrong and something else went wrong and I'll tell you one thing every time I made a trip to Somerset to have to repair it I was repenting the whole way up and the whole way back because the Lord was teaching this little boy I better pray about trading cars now I know some of you sat there and you say he is so simple I am but I'm spirit-led so which would you rather be it's up to you you make your choice but you see the spirit of God if I would have been sensitive and pray they must have their van sitting on that lot but I had my mind made up I I wanted that pretty burgundy one with all them stripes on it and the Lord said go ahead stripes for stripes I guarantee you one thing I've never got another vehicle after that one without praying about it I don't care if it's a Cadillac if it's a Mercedes or a BMW whatever you're gonna get you better say Lord Jesus help me help me Lord I need your help some of y'all look at them helpful strains and then you wonder why you're not closer to God because we keep him out of so many Avenues of our life some of you sisters don't think you need him to help you in your house house jobs you do sisters you need him to help you to be the right kind of mother and the right kind of wife and the right kind of cook and all of that but the natural man I know how to serve God I don't know how to be a wife I know how to be and remember every one of those avenues that you exclude him I don't need a man to help me cook I'm not a cook I don't know how to do I know another one another one another one another one another one so what is it really last that you can't do you can't change your body or somebody be working on that three is that something you need him for well y'all was shouting last night pounding today always the difference in an evangelist and a pastor aren't you now watch God because they are foolish you see why some of y'all are thinking like what I'm talking about today because you think I'm foolish you think the things I'm saying are foolish now you know what part of you that is the natural sensual animal breast life now many of y'all know I do woodworking stuff and just piddle really build this and that and the other but there's times I cannot figure out how to make something work I don't get online to a how-to list woodworking for dummies I don't go here and go there and try to figure out I think God please help me help me to help me to figure this out you say you ask him about stuff like that who do you think made this world and again he knows all about mathematics he knows all about equations and measurements but don't you ever do that you brothers ever do that when you're trying to figure out a plan legal you can't figure out how you say Lord please help me help me to figure this out yo that's crazy it's not crazy he wants to be there every Avenue of Our Lives if we'll ask him I'll come from downstairs and go upstairs and tell Carol I figured it out she said did you suggested I asked the Lord and he helped me all right that one tells him yolks y'all got that smirk on your face when you're online you're trying to figure out things in the library you can't do it or should I call brother Donnie don't call me I ain't no office expert amen call on Jesus your sister's trying to figure out oh God how do I do this in the home how do I create this out Mr Lord help me today how do I do it Lord let me get a Better Homes and Garden Magazine no they won't tell you it's wrote by foolish people read by a lot of foolish people put together by foolish people put together amen by the people that don't even believe in God here's the book that makes Better Homes friends they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned I love this word discerned examine judge to investigate examine inquire into scrutinize sift question determine the Excellence or defects of any person or thing so you're looking at broadening your business or business adventure the nature you may talk to a banker you may talk to you know different Financial people and they may say man it's a good time I do this and that and the other but your Holy Ghost feels and you pray about it and you pray about it and say I better not do it something right and people say man you better go you better man you can make a killing you're not gray stripes or red but some within your scrutinizes it's investigating with them you know oh it's got this glass in its hand it's a something ain't right it's examining school not since I'm really looking and say what is the matter with me oh everything seems like I should do that sensibly you know everything similar but some said don't you do it and then you back away and a year goes by or six months goes by and you look at that very thing you would have done and it would have absolutely destroyed you had you done it what was it not your Banker not your financial consultants but the discerner on the inside I know some of you struggle financially you say I wish I had more money I wish I could I could I've accepted the fact a long time ago there's some folks that God can trust with money and others he can't and if God can't trust me with a lot of money I'd rather be poor every day of my life amen that have all kinds of money and it hindered me a lot I don't mean I'm less of a Christian than the man can handle money some folks can't handle money some folks can't handle lots of other things but I want God to give to me do you I want God to give to me and then trust me with what he knows I'm capable of doing I don't want my father to grant me something that I would foolishly ask if it would annihilate me or destroy me [Music] yeah so the natural man does not have this ability to spiritually discern so he looks at others around him this guy's prospering this this all this is what's the problem with me God don't love me God don't Wendy discernment some folks is going to struggle in money some is going to struggle in their healths some is going to struggle in their mind and Satan will always take that person that he knows you're having a battle with a certain thing and show you them look at them look how good they're doing they're going through this and that and the other but let me tell you something friend it's going to come to the ultimate true sing of a Son of God is that he's judged by no man including this man none of you know my heart none of you you think you do your mouth I'm not saying well I know you I know no we don't only me only me I know what's in my heart I've been so misjudging you have to right but yet listen to this neither does this know my heart and this can be anointed by the devil and this will tell me I'm not a Christian this will tell me I'm not going this will tell me what am I doing if I listen to that I am listening to the Natural man which cannot discern and know the spiritual things of God and this natural man will talk me into trouble and caught me into making mistakes and then this natural man will tell me that proves you're not a child of God that proves shall not predestinate it but if I can ever get to the spot and you can get there with me then I will refuse to be judged by any person in this message I'll refuse to be judged by any of you in this message I will refuse to be judged even by my own flesh for my flesh cannot know what's inside of my soul how can you speak my destiny when he does not know what I am hallelujah how can my flesh speak of where I'm going when it does not know me thank you Jesus [Music] I take this body to church everywhere my soul goes it's kind of love or hate relationship I need a right foot to press the gas pedal to get to church I need a right hand to turn the key on the right hand to pull the gear shift and drive I need a left hand also confidence so this body goes with me to church and yet my body and my spirit and my soul we're all three here today but there's only one realm that'll really receive from the real Supernatural realm of God my flesh is heard more preaching than most of you put together right we have some Pentecost I used to preach 20 and 25 days in a row coach out in Louisiana one not then Indiana the next fasting 7 10 12 14 days at a time right hey my slash has heard a lot of preaching it don't lock it a bit more today than it did and I first got saved amen my old body is spending more meetings than you can imagine he still gets tired of going to church born the Holy Ghost moves on me and the spirit of God goes to anoint me my soul is rejoicing like a little kid this 56 year old man said little Jimmy told me a few weeks ago said boy you can't take it like you could I said no I sure okay why this whole flash gets wore out he is a natural man so today the soul that's in me the very being of God will hear things and catch things that this outer man will absolutely know nothing about and yet it will come through this outer man's ears now watch this he says the natural man receiveth not receiveth not he does not embrace cannot comprehend cannot understand the beauty of their wisdom cannot comprehend the depth of the mystery does not even understand the form the necessity of such things the requirement why do it why the natural man does not have the ability he's born without it but the man or woman who's born of the Holy Ghost they are born with it from within their soul so the natural man will argue how can we have to do this and how come we can't go there how come we got to do this and how come how come how come how come and those that are born again they're they're saying well I don't understand it either but if that's what the word says I want to do it I don't understand why I don't understand how to come but I just want to do it now the natural man would argue he was debate [Music] because he considers the spiritual things of God foolishness it's just foolish it's foolish to go to church [Music] it's foolish to hear a picture why would you want to hear a preacher when you tell me listen to a tape what difference does it make up a woman wears a dress or pants or a guts her hair what difference does that make goggles with the heart he does and he sees what the outside looks at he knows what the heart is [Music] you say some old Barnes need a new coat of paint I I agree Barnes but that's showing a very good comparison to your face is it what if I come up to some of you women here at the church who are a little bit of pink and a little bit of black a little bit of this and that and the other and I'll call you Barn do you think that's pretty notable hello sister Barnes oh is that my name Barn it's bad it's Reagan it's uh well no I'm just saying that's what you look like born not Barnes b-a-r-n-e-s but Barn b-a-r-n which is where you keep a stinking hog stinking cow sinking cars stinking chickens all kinds of stinking stuff Jesus ain't coming for a barn he's coming for a church well that's a good Lord thank you [Applause] amen here coming for Barnes he's coming for temples Tabernacles of the Living God but the natural man will reason and reason Prince don't don't look down on them they can't help that you try to witness young girls you try to witness brothers and sisters and you try to help people see it and they'll argue and go back and argue don't go call them serpent seed they're just natural and converted people they don't have the ability to receive the things of God they think it's foolish thank God you don't oh my god notice the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he knows him now we'll use this to close out with this last Sunday but let's look at it again today neither can he know them perceive understand to learn to know come to know get a knowledge of perceived to become acquainted with to know to the Greeks this meant to know facts but these facts may or may not affect one's conduct to the Jew knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct one did not know something until that fact I love this had a practical outworking in his life friends I'm afraid many of our message people this is exactly where they are we've got two categories of people in this message and they're both found in the meaning of this one word and who can spit out all kinds of facts it may or may not affect the way they live look believe behave and so on but then there's others believing this word it's more than a bunch of facts it's changing their life and it's not just the outside because you can look the part on the outside and still be corrupting your soul think of how that Paul said now they cannot know them the unconverted man cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned so they are are able to pick up now how can the holy ghost look at a situation looks perfectly normal but the Holy Ghost looks with a sixth sense and he looks at a situation maybe you're just being nice to us some lady that you're working with but the Holy Ghost senses this could lead to something you're looking at it all the leaves are fine oh it's just you know it's just fine we work at the same place no problem but the spirit of God says hat be careful watch that how many preachers have been led into situations into snares in their own church simply because they did not have that ability many of them or if they did have a little portion of that ability they certainly didn't follow it and yet they felt into a snare how many churches have been bust to Pieces how many homes how many families come on children don't get quiet how many marriages have been bust to Pieces because somebody did not follow this little function right here of the Holy Ghost and yet depended what mama said he was a nice boy Uncle so-and-so said he was a nice boy let me tell you something girls when that boy goes to calling on you and go to texting you and whatever more you can pretty well figure he's going to be on his best behavior [Music] you don't don't want to marry him on that what you want to look for is his normal behavior which probably isn't the Gallant Romeo oh you're so beautiful oh your fingers all my mama your hair oh you text so beautifully I just watched the way you do in church and ah you better get past that sis and find out what it really is like come on now don't get quiet most you sisters can say Amen to this most of those men never carry that over after you've been married very long anyway [Music] Lord have mercy what's the matter you women but you don't want the Holy Ghost Inside and say something wrong here even though your flesh May appeal to it your spirit May appeal to your senses May appeal to it you see if evil to have the Holy Ghost when the serpent come up that day in the Garden of Eden and he started speaking the word that buster would have went off inside her because you see the Trap was laid hidden deep within the serpent which had a place for a soul but didn't have one now you see the soul was the hidden part so when God made the serpent which was an upright creature is not a snake he made him to worry that he could reason he could think apparently had a spirit that was very similar to a human being and had a place for a soul but didn't have a soul it just so happened Satan had a soul so Satan steps inside this serpent now this serpent becomes in the full image of a man Soul Spirit body so from that if she would have had the Holy Ghost discernment as soon as he'd have walked up man the Bowser would have went off inside of her soul but you know what the snare was laid so perfectly because the body hadn't changed he wasn't like a monster he wasn't some kind of freaky looking thing but the change was where in the SOB of the doubt in the song My Lord help us in the soul so he walked up looked the same talked the same but the soul started projecting okay he contacts her outside contacts her spirit and then Satan's Soul connected her soul she walked right into the snare and you know then results why daughters our sons how do they get in such fixes because they think they've been raised in a message Church I think they got the Holy Ghost and they believe the message and they think they got the ability to discern I'll tell you one thing if there's anything anybody ought to pray over it's a mate are a place to live a job but a woman whoa a man whoa I don't found out if you get a lemon vehicle you can't trade them off but if you get a lemon man or a lemon woman you just walk around like this [Applause] oh yeah how are you doing doing all right what are you doing stay here I see you still got that living Horseman no not packing up for kiss they're puckered up just to live [Applause] foreign well glory to God what in the world am I doing on this way the Lord you know the natural man will follow what senses he'll follow sight he'll follow feeling he'll follow emotions so investigate that's right the soul looks the soul scrutinizes in the Solar vertebrate that message back into the recipient and say stay away from him text him back and tell him you're not interested but every girl in the church would want him are you sure I don't care if every girl in the church wanted him if the Holy Ghost didn't want him I wouldn't want him right oh but he's the cutest boy in the whole church oh I didn't realize cute was the only thing we was going by in fact so pray tell me how did most of you men even get married maybe you were cuter when you were younger brother Greg I don't know [Applause] well you brother Trey I'm just asking I don't know but you see the real spirit of God deserves it looks beyond the pretty hair it looks beyond the nice car down into the soul he said Jesus don't you do it this man will cause you 40 Years of hell on Earth me me me me a real daughter of God say Lord help me please Lord I feel emotionally attracted to this man I feel whatever more but God please help me help me God again brother Tony can a person fall in love with the wrong person sure they can there's men in this church that could fall in love with somebody else's wife that sure don't mean it's a Holy Ghost why you're a human being as part of your spirit oh I wear a Perfect Mate bunch of hogwash lust come on children lust and passion is that animal part oh my perfect maid is not about sex a perfect maid is not about lust A Perfect Mate is joining together two Souls by the word of God [Applause] everything oh that sure was a long time on verse 14. let's look at verse 15 now but he I love this that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man now I'm convinced friends most of us first of all we know what this even means we certainly don't even live by it do you understand that if you know who you are what your position is what other people say about you if you come to that spot it can have very little if any bearing on who you are you're listening to what they say and criticize it there's nothing that breaks a child of a god a child of God's heart any more than for somebody to say you're a hypocrite you're not a very good Christian you're this out the other and we're letting them judge us we're not people and you'll even let your own self judge you it has no right amen the son and of God and Betty Reagan has no right to judge this seed Within Me it has no right to tell me I'm going to hell it has no right to tell me who I am and who I am not [Applause] watch he she that are spiritual look at this word again pneumaticus belonging to the Divine spirit the Holy Ghost one who is filled with and governed by now this is the same word remember that your human Spirit comes from pneumatic so you have this part and this is where the deceit Lays you're born with part of this root word in you your human spirit but this must come by new births pneumaticals does not come the because you're a mortal pneumaticus comes because you're reborn and immortal than those who are spiritual now keep in mind now I'm not talking about people that are you know that are off the deep end and this and that and the other people that are all the time extreme and emotional and surely the spiritual people will be emotional but many times we classify a spiritual church it's one that has fast music loud music or five songs or whatever more and a spiritual person is one who jerks and shouts and I'm against none of that that's not the Biblical term of spiritual amen good freak but he that is spiritual judges don't raise your hand now but how many of you do this do you judge All Saints all things you do everywhere you go everything you do your motives your objectives now we're quick to judge other people that's the kind of judgment that gets you in trouble this is the kind that keeps you out if we could judge all things about our life the way we judge everybody else man we'll be a church I'm telling you but instead we judge one another we're trying while so and so on us and you're trying to judge the heart you don't know their heart for friends it's so easy for us to misjudge people that's why we should commit the judgment to God pray for people sure we disagree with people we disagree with our motives but when it's all said and done none of us knows the heart of another come on you might as well say Amen but yet the thing we should judge and God wants us to judge we just let pass before us and we just go along and but he that is spiritual he judges he won't go here why the spirit forbade him you imagine a preacher turning down a big meeting you imagine message preachers turning down a big meeting well there's going to be lots of lots of folks there I can't imagine very many of them doing it now can you imagine them turning down a big meeting and taking a little meeting because they felt little the Lord to go the little place I guarantee what you'll find you'll find God blessing that little meeting better than it would the big me now most of us want the high seat but real true that are led by the spirit of God they judge they judge they don't need to be bragged on they don't need to be told all the time they're the best in the church and they're the pillars of the church why they know who they are let's not first I'll get compliments it's nice to know that we're appreciated and part of it now listen to me friend if your name is never called over this pulpit and we live to be a thousand years old if you know who you are it ain't gonna shake you one bit why because you're already Discerning you are part of this church by predestination you're not part of this church because I call your name away brother the bird but this one's all sisters that's not what makes you a part of the church but you know your position there ain't enough Devils there ain't enough gossip there ain't enough Church plants that's going to run you off because you are judged I've no man you will not allow yourself Amen to be brought down to where other people are [Applause] do you understand why Satan does this he will have people to judge us and say things about us it's not even true knowing that it will destroy us bring us to such a place we're so down oh so-and-so said this about and so and so said that about me and look what effect is Heaven on you I feel sorry for so-and-so cause they run their long tongue but I feel sorry for you because you don't know who you are and it's damaging you instead of you looking back at him and saying I can laugh at that that ain't the truth I don't know my heart they don't know what's in me I'm not doing that for Glory I'm not doing that for any other purpose other than to please God oh my God said him and sister media and brother levale was in his house one time you hear this in 1963. he said she she spoke up and said Bill we all know the Lord LED you to Arizona the first time you said you come back and said that's what's bothering me that's what's troubled me that God wants you to come back here they said well it don't matter to me I don't care wherever he believes me I want to serve him and then levale said I don't see how you can take that brother people saying things about you and calling you things I said brother Lee I hope this don't bother you but brotherly he's always been a little click on the trigger I love a man like that don't you not one that's quick on the trigger but one that can tell you about it so he said leave out said I don't understand how you could take all that and people saying this uh ah that brother man said that was a little trial that was ordained before the foundation of the world to see how I'd handle it and he said all of a sudden while we're standing there in that room a hand appeared and wrote On The Wall come on back to Arizona wonder if his attitude didn't have a lot to do with that hand appearing now wonder brother Brandon would have been quick on the triggers and drawed out his gun what if that ham would have felt welcome rotten on the wall I wonder if that's why we don't see more rotten on the wall it's because our attitudes and we let people judge us and we will let what they say affect us to such a place some folks won't even come to church no more because so and so said so and so and might be two or three people and yet they think them two or three peoples this whole church come on children deserve judge judge properly oh my but he judges all same yet he himself he's judged by no man that doesn't mean that people ain't going to judge him oh no it's not that he will not accept their judgment he will not allow himself to be judged by infidels and unbelievers and make Believers and we Christians brother Brandon was judged by many of the people has been a woman hater do your sisters hold that opinion you don't why because you're spiritual you look at the totally different way you don't look at Brothers trying to be mean to you hateful you do you sisters do you look at brother man we're trying to be hard on your sisters and mean and brother Brown had an attitude to the women will you look at brother brahmins being a prophet of God one that God used to keep sisters out of hell right but you not did it by the natural man it must be spiritually discerned so when we hear him raking down on women and Blasting them you know what if you're here with a spiritual ear you hear a total different thing you do not hear of the Judgment oh he was a woman Heather like oh Paul he down this side of the other you've got spiritual discernment you don't hear a woman hate her you hear a Wild Man Who Loved God's children you hear a man who love God's daughters why spiritually discerned now let me find a place to close watch this so the man that is all sings verse 16. cure your way to go into this for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ now notice the mind of Christ is not identified with deep things and it'll have that the mind of Christ is not identified with just emotion and it'll have that but the mind of Christ is identified with the ability to rightly discern and judge sonship do you understand there's folks that come to this church and sit here and think I'm the devil they'll come here and set service after service after service and think I am one of the worst indentments to this message and claim to have the Holy Ghost and yes there's thousands around the world who feel the very opposite and you know what if I allow myself as a pastor and I feel that coming if I allow myself as a pastor and I allow myself under that judgment I'll go to striking out and I'll take the entire services to preach on them blast them blast them Hammer them why because I'm coming under their false judgment or I can raise myself above their judgment and refuse because I know who I am I know what I am I know where I'm from so I can go that way and take the high road and go above what they project and preach to those of you who come to church to be fed or I can get under that judgment under that condemnation and Hammer and beaten thrush and then you all starve to death because I've come under that judgment it don't just work for me it works for you oh Hallelujah you can allow people here at this church to run you down and talk about you and control you and manipulate you if you want to but I refuse to do so I'll refuse to allow people to judge me and me walk under their condemnation which is only fabricated [Applause] amen [Applause] foreign friends there's folks on this message that pray I will die there's folks in this message that pray I won't have a heart attack because they think I'm such a curse poor things is that pitiful if I get killed this afternoon going home in a car wreck some of the message folks that never shouted in their life they'll shout when they hear it it's beautiful it's pitiful with people that have such an attitude people would Rejoice if they heard some terrible happen to me not only me but other preachers that will and some people would do you exactly the same way and yet claim to be Christians and claim to have the spirits of Agape inside of us that's not a god pay Agape does not look for judgment upon others Agape doesn't look for that and neither will the god may allow yourself now we'll condemn that oh you shouldn't have said that you we're only pointing our finger one way we need to go back this way not only tell them you shouldn't have said that but you need to point your back is when you shouldn't let it affect you either you should not let them bring you down use come on down don't get caught [Music] I wish some of the gossipers would put that on Facebook [Applause] so easy for us to put up in the social media so-and-so done this and so and so did that and so and so why don't you write about yourself so-and-so did it and I was beneath them because I shouldn't let it bother me but I did oh y'all smell something now notice he comes to those that are spiritual they judge all things and then he breaks Beyond man's mind to the mind of Christ for who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the new us understanding the capacity for Spiritual truth The Faculty of perceiving Divine things of recognizing goodness and of hating evil amen amen you see what I'm saying as I said folks on the message Hate Me Or Hate other people but they hate what God loves which is peculiar I mean I'm of the mindset this way I want to love what God loves and hate what God hates I don't want to hate what God loves and love what God hates which is where you find many people why because the natural man cannot discern many times what God loves and what God hates now God loves The World God loves Sinners but he does not love their sin amen but in this age everybody wants to just bring them right on into the church and let them continue on living in their sin that's not what God loves God hates that but when you tell what God loves and you're hated because people don't understand they don't have the ability the fruit on son is the word that for awesome to be able to understand the capacity to understand it they're Discerning it by their natural instinct let's stand [Applause] oh but we have the mind of Christ the power of considering and judging soberly calmly and impartially you see the mind of Christ will not take three people with exact circumstances and judge differently according to the social status or according to how much they're worth the mind of Christ will take all three people judge accordingly by the word no matter how much tithes they pay no matter how Wilson they are or how poor they are that's the mind of Christ the mind of Christ will not make special you know terms and special groups in among the elect all the groups of the elect is special but that does not have any special groups that you can get by with this and you can get by with that and you can get by with this and you can get by with that hey you better not say nothing about them and all the rest of us you know we just got to toe the line that's not the mind of Christ that's natural carnal people who don't understand the mind of Christ notice this the power of considering and judging soberly calmly and impartially now you can find this in your Strong's Concordance this is the meaning of the word that Paul chose to use so the mind of Christ is the views feelings and temperament of Christ the views the feelings and the temperament of Christ so how can we tell if we have the mind of Christ by the way you judge can you judge right from wrong or is everything Gray is your judgment true is your judgment just is your judgment impartial because this is the way Christ will judge amen praise the Lord you love him [Music] spiritual discernment inspironments together Lord Jesus thank you today Father for your word Lord it makes me feel so bad because I know so many times I misjudged so many things I misjudged people's motives objectives and I've allowed the Judgment of others about me to affect me Lord I pray that your teachers Lord Jesus you were a man when you're upon the Earth and brother Ben said whenever they laughed at you to score and they're in the New Testament the scripture they liked you to scorn that your face turned red and it embarrassed you so una hat is to feel embarrassment but yet you never let them bring you down to their level and many times when people run us down and talk about us and do bad things against us we focus so much on how wrong they are and that is true they should not do that but why is it we don't focus on how wrong we were to let them affect us in such a way and somebody can post something on Facebook about us or send us an email or a text or whatever ruin our whole day ruin our whole day with you with our family with everybody else because we allow ourselves to come underneath their judgment and then we go to worrying and fretting and fretting and always Lord When people's going to leave church and when there's going to have they're always going to look for an excuse I have been many many people's excuse this church has been many many other people have been and it breaks my heart to think of such you know I would never try to keep anybody out of the kingdom of God I've spent my life trying to bring them in but yet Satan knows how it bothers us forgive us for not recognizing and discerning and realizing who it is that's doing it to us we admit we have shortcomings and failures for that we ask your pardon but all of our shortcomings and our failures that has nothing to do with our souls that we desire people to stay away from you I don't know of anybody I wouldn't want to be in heaven I know of no one that I would want to be their lord yet we allow ourselves to be judged we allow even our own flesh to misjudge us and we will accept that judgment instead of refusing to allow the outer man and the spirit man to pass this condemnation to the soul make us spiritual Lord I desire to have a spiritual church father by that I don't mean one that worships and we do and I thank you for that I thank you for that about our church but Lord we don't want to just be a worshiping Church we want to be a spiritual church that we can judge Help the People Lord and thinking of their behavior and their activity what they do I mentioned Facebook I mentioned again because Lord is becoming such a thing in the message it's easy to see that many of the people who post the things I don't have it so I don't know I'm just just what I'm told they have no discernment whatsoever posting things that are so foolish it's like Facebook gets everybody a Pulpit every man woman boy and girl can preach on Facebook help them Lord to realize when they post something on Facebook and they're identified that they come with to this church they are falsely pulling me in this church into that identity they're pulling you they're pulling this message into that identity of what they're posting but the natural man wants to argue and fuss and debate Lord Jesus help us help us to be led by the Holy Ghost governed by the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus forgive us of our carnality forgive us of our foolishness make us like you Lord make us like you Lord Jesus Hallelujah is that your desire today you raise your hand say Lord be mindful of me now many of you ain't got Facebook you know what you're like me you know what it even is really but in your own everyday life in your temper in the way you answer people and what you say back if the deacons ask you to park in a certain spot you fly off the handle no you're going to tell me that's the mind of Christ no the deacons ask you to be make your children be quiet you get mad and stomp out you're going to tell me that's the mind of Christ no it's not we're here to worship this is not a circus we're not here to to entertain your children we're here to worship they ask you to be quiet in the foyer and all that look for him this is a house of worship we want to come here and worship and we want to respect God so judge all things so many of us are so so fast to speak but the scripture tells us be quick to hear and slow to speak and slow giraffes the mind of Christ will judge all these things but the carnal natural man will figure it out and to do sit and add it and subtract it and figure it all out then you've done said it and done done it and done made a mess and then trying to figure out how to fix it when the spirit of God would have led you right around that trap I don't know about you I want to be more spiritual more spiritual I'm going to talk about having dreams and visions I'm not talking about speaking in tongues I thank God for those things some dreams and things that I've had from the Lord to be honest with you sometimes I wish I hadn't had them because sometimes things that you see you wish you hadn't seen them things that you see about people an Insight that God gives you sometimes I wish I didn't know it because it was so much on you I ain't talking about being that I'm talking about brother Jim been able to discern to discern and judge all things scrutinize take a magnifying glass not of the word just the word but of the spirit because sometimes the word don't misunderstand me the word won't give you brother Matthew the direction you need you listen to a tape and you search in the message and it won't give you that direction you know why it's a spirit-led magnifying glass there won't be a scripture about the gym there won't be a quarter but it'll be that Spirit leading you oh God oh God Hallelujah Hallelujah let's just raise your hands and make our hands as it were a doorway let's just slide our hands and her arms be a doorway into our heart not that we need to get saved not that many of you need to get the Holy Ghost but that we can just give him more control that his mind can judge that if I had the mind of Christ and I have his feelings I have his views I have his perspectives so that if I will allow it those views will speak out of me and act out of me and reflect out of me and out of you and me me more like he let's sing it together now woman make me more like this [Music] Jesus name [Music] everybody with all your heart now won't you give me a heart that Spirit was your [Laughter] [Music] lovely raise your hands close your eyes and sing it oh man me more spiritual like thee the [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah help us Lord God help us Lord God thank you Jesus give me a heart that filled with love [Laughter] [Music] [Music] help me to discern Lord scrutinize not in a harsh way not in a judgmental way of other people but the events around me the circumstances the things that involve me Lord God help me Jesus give me a heart with your love and make me more like this [Music] before we go would you turn him put your hand on the person there by you now want to ask you something children what would we give for a spiritual church upon the seal what would a spiritual church I'm going to talk about what you and I might think Are Spiritual to the people but what God would look at us and say Happy Valley Church is a spiritual church what would that be worse to us what would be the value of such a thing what could we do if we were a more spiritual body of the spirit of God moving among us and not just Supernatural things with healings and miracles and things like that and we long for that in a greater way but to make us like this to all we judge and we have the ability to know right from wrong we have the ability to judge from within us and hear that buzzer go off within our soul I want you to pray for that person standing by you no doubt they have made many mistakes no doubt they have fallen into many snares even this very day and we'll tell you you believe what you want to but the Holy Ghost changed my direction earlier into this sermon and led me in this certain way for somebody here today that he's dealing with your heart this is not on my notes it was even nothing that I even studied out to go and I felt him changed me so he knows what he's done you may you may not know that person that you got your hand on there may be a snare laid in front of them tomorrow maybe a woman maybe a man maybe a temper maybe a business transaction they're fixing to make pray for him that God will leave him that God will help some that even though they look at the ground the scenario around the habitat looks identical but yet there's a leaf out of place there's a branch wrong there's something wrong their senses may not pick it up but the spirit of God can lead him let's just pray for one another before we go Lord Jesus I'm not a prophet so I do not have the ability to peer into the supernatural the way prophets would but yet I know father that you lead your children and I know this service today Father God was orchestrated by you you know I didn't even get to go the direction that I'd studied and I'd laid out yesterday and today but that doesn't matter what's important is I followed you Lord Jesus I do not know what lay before these people nor do I know even what lays before me but I ask you that should help us Lord or this enemy he knows how to prepare the snares he knows how to make them Lord as I've been into different nations in Africa it was I was taken to the Messiah Mara many years ago by Brethren the message who's a game warden there and he took us about and showed us in a little closer perspective on what most people get to see how the rhinoceros and the elephant and different animals are poached and how they make snares for them and Lord as I've seen some of these snares and it's absolutely amazing as I would stand and look right at them or see somebody that make a snare for a rabbit or something else and me with an untrained eye look right at it and never even see it but the person with a trained eye or the person who laid the snare they could point out this and that and the other to me and once they pointed it out I would see it Lord Jesus we need you Lord to help us in our life we know you don't lay the snares but you know the man who did Lay Him Lord may you help these young people help these businessmen help these Housewives help the ministers help every one of us Lord God from the front to the back to the nurseries those are streaming help all of us Lord help us father when Satan lay snares before us may we be led by the mind of Christ we want to be spiritual Lord Jesus when I say that I don't mean fanaticism or I feel led I feel led I feel led but Lord whenever we say that I feel that it will prove if we was led of you or not because it will be the mind of Christ to judge soberly discreetly without impartiality help us Lord every man woman boy and girl that is filled with the Holy Ghost in This Place Lord God I believe we need this more than ever before in our lives to be led by the spirit of God help us Lord Jesus make us more sensitive father oh granted Lord God that we may have the mind of Christ to discern to scrutinize to judge to look granted father in Jesus Christ's name praise the Lord praise the Lord I receive it Lord Jesus I receive it Lord Jesus you believe me Saints you believe it you receive it as well I receive it Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word be it unto me according to Thy word Lord amen granted I pray Heavenly Father in Jesus Christ's name oh praise the Lord praise the Lord Jesus thank
