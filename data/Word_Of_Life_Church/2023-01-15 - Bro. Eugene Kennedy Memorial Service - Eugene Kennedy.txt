we look out through the window panes as showers sweep the land the wind blows fiercely through the trees the storm now has command we understand it's Nature's Way and now it soon will pass and flowers will Bloom because of this and Greener grows the grass so when there comes to us dark clouds clouds as trials grief or pain we will may know as in the past the sun will shine again although the storms are hard to Bear we'll praise God as we should and Trust his promise where he said all things will work for good Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love the Lord if I could I just want to invite brother Daryl who's been a good friend to us could friend to Dad throughout the years good thank you they asked me to read the obituary and so if I butcher your name I apologize I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer but we will do the best we can Roger Eugene Kennedy 55 of Johnson City Tennessee passed away on December the 4th 2022 after battling an unknown illness for nearly 19 years Eugene was born on September the 14th 1967 to parents Willie and Linda Kennedy in Sandusky Ohio he was a devout Christian loving husband and proud father despite the frustrations disappointments and the unentered questions from countless Physicians over the years Eugene maintained his faith his influence spread worldwide and was a pillar of inspiration at

dearly honorary Paul barriers are Brooke sink Lucas Talkington owing Talkington Micah Brown Josiah Brown and Zion Brown and you know if if I was to look in the Bible to find a book and a chapter that would describe brother Eugene's life in his character it would have to be the book of Hebrews chapter 11 the faith chapter for you know in in this chapter we find men and women who met great challenges and endured great hardships and yet their faith in God never wavered and to me that describes brother UT hear them to God's word he believed God was his healer his strength was in the word of God and I remember many a time that I would fellowship with brother Donnie in the study and right before the service start I would slip out and come around the parking lot and brother Eugene would be sitting in a car because he was too sick to sit in church and I would always go up to the car and he'd row down the wind and we'd shake hands and pray together and sometimes just give a thumbs up but he was always positive he was always claiming his healing he was always believed in God Hebrews chapter 11 is a chapter of inspiration to me brother Eugene Kennedy his life was an inspiration to me and to all of us and I like to say today go rest high buddy your work is done you kept the faith let us pray father we are gathered here today to remember and to honor the life of our brother Eugene we are taught by your Prophet that eternal life is living your life for others and even in death our brother gave of himself that others might benefit and Lord no doubt many times he wondered how he could be doing any good laying in the bed weak and did his life was a life of inspiration and faith and it touched people the world over living a life for others and father we pray today that you blessed this Memorial of our brother that you bless the family and comfort their hearts and may his memory be in our hearts forever we ask you bless the remainder of this service may it be For

want to say a few things to my family and friends I'm not very good with words but I'll try first of all my church family God could not Place me with better people thanks for all the prayers and for helping us plenty of times Ron and Andrew I thank God so much for allowing me to be a part of your life to God the young men that I'm proud of I didn't have a hand in raising the other children but I'm proud of them too how can I thank my wife for being outside of God my everything you have went through more than anyone I know no one else may know or understand but God knows I hate leaving you behind in such a messed up world but I know God will take care of you better than I ever did all of my family and friends that I haven't seen in a while just know the man you knew before died many

in-laws and grandchildren too it's just hard for anyone to be around someone that's always sick Janet suffered the most because of that I want to see every one of you in heaven I prayed for all of you every day there's a life that's greater than this just saying there's a lot that's greater than just saying I believe in God if you believe if you believe in him then prove it don't let one thing keep you from the house of God go sell all your hat all you have if it's riches keeping you away if you're too busy if it's complexes if people if you're not comfortable around people for some reason and

love you all and we'll be waiting with our loved ones that that has gone before me I fought as long as and hard as I could just stay up I fought as long and and hard as I could to stay but God had other plans even while writing this I'm not giving up it's just things aren't looking so good hopefully no one will ever have to read this brother Donny brother Daryl J.D Whitson have been very special to me God couldn't have placed have placed me under a better Ministry thank you all so much for all your sacrifices um and if I could ask brother Joe Brown if you come up and sing is happy appreciate you God is good in everything that I am my desire is to be a light and a witness to A Life That's greater than any life that I know and to be an impact in some way to make a difference to lighten the load even if it's just a small and always enjoyed Eugene the times we go visit and just do a little simple stuff Sister Janet that goes a long way people may forget what you say people may even forget what they what you do but they will never forget how you make them feel and I'm just going to try this song I Believe brother Eugene wanted me to sing it and uh my how do you say goodbye how do you let go when the storm s of life are raging Stand By Me when the storms of life are raging Stand By Me when this old world old is tossing me like a sheep out on now [Music] with wind and water Stand By Me waiting foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here when this world tossing me like a sheep how long on the sea thou who knows all about me Stand By Me when my body is seeing sick and feeble Master said Stand By Me when this body we can feel both Stand By Me yeah when I have gone as far as I can and before you I will stand oh thou right Rock of Ages and by me with the storm of life as he laid in the bed with storms of life are raging for the same by me way when I'm done the best I can and my friends just don't understand and thou who know s all about me [Music] and please Master said [Music] bye eyes me I certainly wish to extend our condolences to family friends of our to party brother his life certainly touched us all in one way or another you are here today to signify that by your presence Genesis chapter 2 verse 7. the scripture says in the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life and Man became a living soul so I'd like to ask you today what is man soul and soil soul and soil breasts and body puff of breath a pile of dust so if that's all that man is in this life than when man departs it certainly is a sad departure but yet we know that there is another part of that that is beyond what science chemistry what scientologists anthropologists different people would be able to see that is a life that God himself placed there and we know that life is a sacred thing to God so God puts every Mortal who comes to the Earth their name in a book thankfully we're the only ones that can contribute to what's in that book and thankfully no one else can do that for us most of us have enough to answer for and what we've done ourselves I'm sure glad you can add to my book and you better be glad I can't add to yours because we would all be in worse shape than what we are today I'm sure but yet the great thing about it is that God is the only one that can change the substance and the things that are written in that book when Eugene was born just a wee little fella nothing went on for a long time several years went by before bad things started being recorded in that book but as with all the rest of us that are here and every other Mortal that has lived or ever lived on the face of the Earth those bad things begin to accumulate might have started with a lie might have started with taking something that wasn't yours and yet it seems to go and go and grow and grow and the abundance of those things by the time some of us reached 15 16 18 20 30 it is accumulated to such a mass that is against us job says it this way in Job chapter 8 verse 9 for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon Earth are a shadow now you can't see it because of where you are but as I put my hand up here it's between these lights and this Pulpit so it's a shadow I put my hand there it appears I take my hand away it disappears I put my hand back it appears I take my hand away it disappears that's your life that's my life now if we live to be 50 60 70 80 years old still it is so short in comparison to Eternity again job says in Job 14 1 man that is born of woman is but few days and full of trouble he cometh Force like a flower and is cut down he fleece also as a shadow and continuous knot and thus thou open Thine Eyes speaking to God do you open your eyes upon such a one as that and bring me into judgment with thee can you imagine almighty God judging a flower God judging a shadow that was here for 50 60. what happens to that shadow what happens to what made the shadow now in order to have a shadow there has to be a contrast between light and darkness the elements the chemistry in my hand comes between the light and been able to reflect here so the light rays cannot penetrate through my hand I would hold up a piece of clear glass it would be totally different light would be able to come right through it and pass born in darkness come to the world in darkness I want you to notice again that psalmist David and Psalms 39 4 says Lord make me to know my end and the measure of my days now if you can imagine that when each of us come to the Earth here is a measuring tape of life now we were going to make this Pulpit or make this piece here we wanted to make it eight and a half inches wide by 14 and a half inches long by three quarters of an inch deep how are we going to do that maybe there's some guys here today that are good enough you'd be able to look at it and you'd be able to take your pencil Mark a mark most of us will not be able to do that we would have to take a measuring tape hold it on this side come to this side and let's say 14 and a half inches or whatever we want to make it would place a Mark we would go to the other side eight and three quarters of an inch would take stock material three quarters of an inch thick that have been planed on both sides and we'll be able to cut it according to the mark That's your life that's my life that was brother Eugene's life almighty God the day that he was born held the tape on the beginning almighty God knew where the tape would end on the other side I didn't he didn't he wanted to live no doubt to the Rapture I know he wanted to live to be able to move into our new church oh he every time I'd go see him I'm just believing brother Donnie I'm just believing I'm going to be able to go but apparently the measuring tape went from here to here and it didn't include that in his life each of us though we receive the Breath of Life from God we don't receive the exact allotment of time by which our space will cover you see I hold in my hand here today a check that may not look like your normal average check but it was a check written by Brother Eugene Kennedy let me read to you what it says September the 14th 2020. Bank of God in heaven and Eternity paid to the order of Eugene Kennedy for what healing and all that he has need of all on the bottom of the check here is signed Jesus Christ over on this side of the line is put the word let me tell you today he has been paid in full for this chat now did he know exactly when he would be paid in full no he believed was all of his heart that God was going to him all you say why he finally beat him oh I beg to differ with you you see he went to this clinic and that clinic this doctrine that thought well sir we're not sure it could be this try this and doctors as you know are truly practicing medicine and a lot of them practice on us so he tried this and try that and do this and do that did they ever find the answer no they never did but yet you know David says it this way in Psalms 39 5. behold thou Hast made my days as an Han bread right here now look how short that is now some of you've got a bigger hand than mine goodness look at brother John's hand hold your hand up our buddy wow what a hand but how short would that be compared to Eternity so your hand breath is like this so say a man that would be granted a three score and ten this first finger would be 20 years second another 20. third one another 20 and then the last one so here's the span of our life right here you know some people are known for what they do in life singers great Builders great contractors people that are politicians they are known and whenever they die people standing all he done this and she done that and he did this and that but brother Eugene wasn't known just for what he did he was known for what he could not do some people's faith is manifested by what they do in life brother Eugene's Faith was manifested more so and what God didn't allow him to do he could do many things talented very gifted but his faith his crowning of his life was not known so much in what he did but what God kept him from doing and he believed God with all of his heart you see for some of you you'll never go through that you'll look back in life and you'll say wow I accomplished this and this and I did that and I made a fortune and I'd done this and I'd done and I done and I've done how many times did I sat with our brother when I go to visit him one of the last times that I was there had been several months before he passed and he talked about just laying there in the bed can never do anything and he said I just wish I had a carburetor off of a car where I could just sit here and hold it on my chest and just take it apart and put it back together or a model car or something where I could just do something well I happened to mention that to somebody and somebody bought him one and I brought it to his door and delivered it now can you imagine wanting to put a model car together to take a carburetor and take the floats out of it and take the screws out of it and be able to put it back together so I wasn't known just for what he did but what he was kept from doing but still had the attitude the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord David went on to say in Psalm 78 39. for he remembered that they were but flesh talking about God remembering us a wind that passeth away and cometh not again David said my days are like a shadow that decline us I am wizard like the grass again it says man is like to vanity his days are as a shadow that pass away James picked up the same thought in the New Testament whereas you know not what shall be on the moral for what is your life it is even a vapor a vapor which is even more condescending than a cloud we know that clouds don't just pop just appear and most of the time they don't just disappear but they build and they build and they accumulate and accumulate but a vapor can come up in just a few moments and what does that Vapor do it disappears in exactly the same way if you live around this area or you're familiar with this area and it can be just as clear as it can be on Roan Street it can be clear in Elizabethton until you head to Gray and there's something about Gray Tennessee it's one of the foggiest places I've ever been in my entire life and I've been in England and what is it about gray there's some people here that live here I used to live there myself there's just something about it but you know what as many days as I've lived here many years I've lived here and drove through gray and you go through and it will be so clear but you get on the other side of gray and it dissipates and all the fog and all this that has been there and yet it fades away that's your life that's my life brother Eugene's told me many times brother Donnie I just wish I could do something I said brother Eugene you don't realize what a blessing your life is to people around the world now he had just sat there and look at me like I was from another planet and he said what have I ever done it wasn't what he'd done it was what he wasn't allowed to do but it's not been that long ago that that man got in his little what did you call that thing little scooter and he's scooted from Mimosa Lane right over here right here to be in church on Sunday morning and I'll tell you what he'll do he'll condemn many people at the day of judgment who were well who were healthy who had the opportunity to go to the house of God and they chose to go somewhere else he cried as brother Daryl said how many times would he set out in his vehicle in the dead of winter and have to start the vehicle to warm it up to keep him from getting so cold he would sit there in the heat of the summer and have to turn the air conditioner on but he wanted to go to church even though he couldn't even make it inside the church he told me many times I want to let the devil know whose side I'm on so what's the preacher going to say about you what's a preacher is going to say about me I'll tell you one thing I want to live my life so that they are so overwhelmed of good things to say they don't know where to start and don't know where to end I hope you don't choose to let your life be wasted and when a preacher has to stand up that he stutters and stammers and says well well well that's a deep subject say something wouldn't it be awful to live your life and you lived it so selfishly you lived it so inconsiderately of God and of others that hardly nothing can be said about you you see the life that brother Eugene lived it's still living today as I looked at some pictures in the videos a while ago and the thought just struck me I wonder what the current photos look like of him in the sixth dimension if we can only imagine it brother Andrew Glover and myself was there was brother Andrew brother Eugene rather just a few hours before he died when I walked in he wasn't breathing he couldn't talk he was so far gone could speak we was there with his family and we talked and they told us of different things different experiences that had but we couldn't fellowship with him on my way back home they called me and told me brother Ryan did he was gone as I prayed with him before we left I told him buddy as your pastor I've tried to lead you tried to guide you tried to help you but you're fixing to make a journey I can't make with you each of us are going to make that Journey one day much as you love your wife she can't go much as you love your children your grandparents your pastor whoever it is there's only one that can make that Journey with you and you sure want to make sure you're in good speaking terms with him you'll imagine this is respiration begin to drop and his blood pressure begin to get low he done made the decision don't recess the technique because there ain't nothing there as you begin to get where he couldn't breathe and he couldn't see and he couldn't hear and this voices begin to get weaker and weaker he began to feel himself pulling out of this old Tabernacle which had been a prison house for all of these years can you imagine in your mind as he stepped out of that into a brand new body I can just see him as he steps out of The Old Ship of Zion and the Lord God sent someone down by the river maybe his mother maybe the prophet of God we don't know who it was do you imagine he stepped out of that ship upon to this to the great Beach he ran his hand through the Bluegrass and the gentle breeze was blowing and he looked around and he saw greens like he'd never seen green before he saw yellows he saw Blues he saw Reds violets crimsons and he began to see people that he had recognized people that he had fellowshipped with around the word and looking at himself have changed the last time I was there with him and I stood by his bed I put my hand over on his knee to pray for him and his knee was smaller than my elbow he was so frail and so puny but can you imagine as he looked down but he saw himself and he could say praise God I'm a new man the bank of Heaven stood by this check Hallelujah you friends you loved ones question will be do you want to see him again you want to sit here today and cry because of your memories that he's gone I I've never understood humans that they will go to a funeral and they will cry and they will DeMent and they they express such sadness because that loved one is gone and they make absolutely no preparation whatsoever to ever see that loved one again and I'm scratching my head and thinking but did you love them or was that just an act that you went through if you really love them don't you want to spend eternity with them I don't mind telling you I cannot wait I wanted was all of my heart for brother Eugene to be able to walk down in our church be able to praise God but the way I figure it and the way I look at it he's already entered into a place that's Way Beyond any church building in this life they have been worshiping they have been singing there has been no Darkness there has been no night there has been joy unspeakable and full of Glory it's beyond Sublime it's beyond perfect it's beyond anything he could ever imagine if we could tap into him for a few moments and ask him brother Eugene what is it what what would you say brother Eugene if you could walk up here and have this microphone what would you tell your family I tell them don't miss it it's greater than anything you can ever imagine brother Eugene would you come back are you kidding me me go back into that frail body that had been a prison for years never but keep pressing the battle let me close with this truly our life being a vapor our life being a shadow our life being so short there's three things we will do with our life we will spend our life we will waste our life or we will invest our life now many of us like Investments but many of us want to invest but we'd like to keep it too you've heard the old saying you want your cake and eat it too if there wasn't a risk to investment everybody would invest but anybody that knows anything about Investments knows there is a risk if you're dealing with a broker that tells you there is no risk at all in this run run well I'm going to take it today I am a broker for the eternal life Assurance company I've been a broker now for many many years I'm 66 years old I've been a broker since I was 18 when I first started preaching I've been a broker all over the continents of the earth I've seen the Lord God bring thousands of people to him and I'm telling you today this is the only company that I can fully say you will not lose your investment but I am going to tell you it will cost you something yes you'll not be able to invest your life and be able to do with your life what you wish there's something about the owner of this company he wants all of you oh I know I know we want to give him what little bit we choose well I don't like this about me God you can have that and I don't like this you can have that but please don't tell me how to live God now look now look just stay off of that I don't want to go to hell I don't want to be lost but God forget this stuff of telling me what to do where I can't go I can't listen this music no no no no no God ah poor baby you want your cake don't you hide me but you see the Lord God says If any man will follow me he must take up his cross and deny himself daily actually the Lord Jesus talked about your cross more than he talked about his own so apparently it's pretty important so I ask you Fred we've come to celebrate this life that has been a blessing to many people around the world as a matter of fact there will be people that will long to meet by the Eugene Kennedy that never even knew him brother Daryl has traveled many countries of the world I myself have been through some of you have been able to go to different countries of the world and people you shook their hand other Eugene never got to do that but people all over the world that I'm in contact with how's brother you change it up how's brother Eugene to send condolence to his family this man never got to go to Uganda had never got to go to Tanzania he never got to go to me in those places how was he known because he was robbed he was robbed it would seem as if though he was robbed of so many things but in his robbery he was faithful to God you see God allows some people never to walk they're confined to a wheelchair from the time they're able to walk their entire life some are robbed of their eyesight some are robbed of this and that and the other that God might get Glory out of their life isn't it amazing when you look at it some bring glory to God but what they do others bring glory to God but what they're not allowed to do but they judge him faithful who considered this their lot in life despairing it I wonder with every head bowed here today if there's any one year who would like to be remembered in prayer would you just raise your hand to the Lord God bless you God bless you if you're not ready my friend to meet the Lord Jesus if you're not ready to meet brother Eugene there's only one way you can be ready we're not pointing you to a church we're not pointing you to some system somewhere or pointing you to a person the Lord Jesus they come to this earth to give his life for you for me for brother yucci it's brother Eugene perfect oh no no he made so many mistakes like all the rest of us but he had found a place where he could be able to confess his mistakes and that was in the blood of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father I wish so love and miss our brother dear God I thank you for him now he's come up to your house Lord I just can't imagine what he's already experienced he's not been sleepy one day he's not been tired he's not been weary and we know him in reality that in that Dimension they they don't peer down in this life and still see the troubles and the difficulties that we are still dealing with it certainly could not be a place of Joy if they did but they moved into a sphere into a realm that is beyond what our poor Minds can imagine today a land of Eternal peace joy happiness they're not going anywhere he's been there to offer that over a month and it no doubt just seems as if though it was yesterday they have no appointments they have no watches no time clocks to punch they're not going anywhere they have just arrived and we have a little bit of understanding in what kind of house they live in it's the house that Paul told us about a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens we long to see our brother father I pray you would help each of us no matter what you've chosen us to be whether we will be known by what we have done or we will be known but what we were not allowed to do may we be faithful father may we be true Lord God I pray touch every heart you saw the hands that were uplifted all over this Congregation of people today father would you minister to him if there's some here today that don't know you may they be able to make peace with you father may even in our brothers memorial service May something of the life that he lived touch some of those that are still here today we committed to you father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask amen spin of them wonderful service memorial for precious brother Ryan I said brother Eugene s wanted me to sing this song as I was going over it this morning uh the name of it's almost home as I was practicing it I just thought the first verse it starts out are you disappointed are you desperate for help do you know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself and I thought that was definitely brother Eugene from well not first met him just a strong muscled guy I mean just and then after years and years of suffering just a shell of himself but as all the speaking is being told about how faithful he was and how he just kept pressing the battle he didn't complain at the end of the second verse says foreign I think he might have left for the rest of us it says find strength and need help in each step knowing Heaven is cheering you on so for the rest of us I believe this today this afternoon brother Eugene is part of that cloud of witnesses that's telling us we're almost home you're almost home you've heard about it all your life and now that he's witnessed it he could say the half has never been told as good as brother Donnie has explained it and as many times as you've heard it it don't touch what it's like when you're here help me if you know this [Music] you're disappointed are you desperate for help you know what it's like to be tired and only a share of yourself foreign [Music] don't have what it takes [Music] it so you can do just to move much less finish the race don't don't forget what lies ahead [Music] almost home brother it won't be long soon all our burdens will be gone home with all your strength sister run on Run free hold up your head praise seen on we are almost home will be hard but we went in the end [Music] simply because it's Jesus in us it's not if but when [Music] take joy in the journey even when it feels long and find strength in each step knowing heaven cheering you all we are almost home brother it won't be long shoot all our Birds will be gone oh with all your strength sister run on all wrong free hold up your head keep pressing on we are almost home we're almost home we're almost home [Music] I know that the cross has brought heaven to us we make no mistake there's still more to come when our flesh and our bones are no longer between who we are right now and where we're meant to be when all it's been lost is made whole again these tears in this pain no longer exist no more walking we're running as fast as we can consider this a second when we're wrong almost home brother it won't be long tune all our burdens will be gone [Music] with all your your strength sisters run on all wrong free hold up your head keep pressing on we are almost home we're almost home we're almost home [Music] we are almost home God bless you all um we just want to take a second you know from the family to to thank everyone for coming out today thank you all for taking the time out of your all schedules to come and honor my father today um I can say that as a son you know you you watch this journey you know we were we were teenagers whenever my dad got sick and I remember going to the hospital the first time and you know hearing people say I don't know how old I was exactly but you know the doctor's saying well you know might only have a couple more months to live we don't really know what's going on you know and it's like you know as a kid you know you take it hard and then years later and get another report well I think he's only got a couple more months to live and all right another decade goes by well we think he's only got a couple more months to live I can tell you one thing right now and you know I think I think brother Donnie did a great job you know covering the faith my dad was a fighter too you know and that's why you know whenever I got the call out in Arizona that you know Dad had passed away I'll be honest with you whenever I I heard he had been kind of declining you know pretty quickly I I'll be honest when you watch someone suffer for two decades your prayers start to change especially knowing what we believe you know the prayers they start changing and you don't I'd pray for healing but in my mind I knew what healing meant whether it was on this side or the other side it didn't make a difference you know and so I remember the the last couple of times you know we got phone calls about it and remember I told my wife I was like you know I said I'll be honest with you I said whether he goes on this side or or sorry whether he's healed on this side or whether he passes away and he's healed on the other side I said makes no difference to me you know it's like I I've cried because I missed them but I haven't cried from sadness one time yet and that's because man could you only imagine what he's what he's doing right now I watched a man confined to a bed a guy who who there were days he couldn't lift the blankets off of himself by himself someone had to lift the blankets off so that he could sorry I feel like I could preach another sermon up here but I just I don't want dad's the thought of dad to just be a sad thought of a guy who was confined to a bed because I watched a strong man the strongest man that I've ever known in my life you know I feel like me and Ryan's had a lot of expectation to live up to because you know I don't get the excuse of well I don't really feel like going to church today because the second I do my thought of my dad comes up and I'm like this guy couldn't lift the blankets off of himself yet mom helped them get in a car and drove to church he couldn't get out of the car he couldn't get inside of the church building he would just sit out in the car because he wanted so badly to be with his church family he told us all the time that this was this was his family and he wanted so badly to be there with you all that he would go and just sit in the car just so he could be close to you he could do like everyone else and he could listen online he could stream it that'd be perfectly fine no one would fault him for that but he couldn't do it he had to be there because that's that's where he felt at home so like I said my dad was strong as can be so my prayer changed the last few times and it was Lord if he's not meant to be healed on this side take him take him peacefully take him quickly that's perfectly fine we're okay with that I remember talking to Dad on the phone he could barely could barely hear me could you know could barely talk and I told him I said look I said we have this side covered I said we'll take care of things on this side don't worry about it I said if you need to go go that's fine sorry I'll uh I'll go ahead and get to this I just I want to take a second and uh I want to thank everyone that made this possible I know that this was kind of difficult to throw together and um I had to change locations and I just I want to thank everyone that took care of the food for the family and stuff and that unfortunately I don't I don't really have names in a list or anything but I just want to say we we appreciate it we greatly appreciate you all taking the time to to do that for our family and our friends um again you know thank you brother Donnie for for speaking today I know that your family's been going through a difficult time and we're praying for you but I want to thank you for for taking the time out today to be able to help honor dad and the musicians thank you all I really appreciate it uh the sound guys who got here early and took care of things and our guys over here who you know helped get things off the stage move things and Maddie who's who's been there for us well the entire week pretty much so uh you know helping any way that he could and I know that since I've been gone there's been so many people take care of dad and take care of Mom and come and help with the house and I could sit here and thank all of y'all so much but I just want to say that that I love you and I know the Dad loved you all too and like I said he wouldn't want this service to be one of sadness he wanted to be you know joyous and people people rejoicing and people drawing closer to the Lord because that's all he actually cared about so again I just I want to thank you all and I want to tell you all that I love you and if you don't mind I'm gonna you know dismiss everyone in prayer actually let me mention a couple of things real quick we do have a uh it's a memory book uh just outside right here some people might have seen it as they came in um they said if you want to if you want to just share a memory that you have of them uh it doesn't matter what it is or if you just want to sign your name that's perfectly fine too but if you could take time to to just do that real quick after the service and also I don't know as far as like floral arrangements if if we had any but if there is uh let Mom go through them first before anybody handles them just to give her time to to look at it and stuff so all right if we could just uh bow our heads please dear heavenly father we just want to tell you Lord that that we love you Lord we want to thank you Father for such a beautiful day that you've given us you've given us more time on this Earth with each other Lord but although we know like brother Donnie spoke Lord this is just a vapor Lord father when you realize how small your life is and how short your life is Lord you look to the things that are bigger Lord it blows my mind sometimes when I see people talk about you know as far as in science and stuff Lord and they see as far as they can see and I'm like yeah but you're thinking with man's understanding they're so much bigger out there feel like if we could just see that and we could just see how much more there is Lord Jesus we wouldn't be walking around sad because a man passed away we'd be rejoicing for what he found for the doorway that he passed through for the life that he has now Lord Jesus I couldn't imagine couldn't imagine Lord that's the life that he has now this is this is this is just a thought this is just a vapor it's nothing compared to what's on that other side Lauren if I could end this in any way I just pray for everyone out there Lord just draw close to him that's all you can do just draw close to him like brother Donnie said we're not trying to lead people to a church or lead people to a man just get to God God will lead you where you need to be but just find him Lord Jesus we just we want to thank you Lord and we just want to say thank you for the for my Dad's life Lord thank you for allowing me and my family to be a part of it Lord because what a blessing it's always been I Love You Lord with all my heart I pray you'll be with these people Lord as they leave today keep them safe in Jesus name amen [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
