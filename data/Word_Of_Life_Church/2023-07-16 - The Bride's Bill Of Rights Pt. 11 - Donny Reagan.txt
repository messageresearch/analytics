thank you the bloody Civil War had ended business was booming in Chicago the streets were buzzing with economic activity at the center of this commerce was respected attorney and real estate investor Horatio G spafford but in 1871 the Great Chicago Fire consumed the windy city and Horatio lost a fortune near the same time his own son age four died of scarlet fever Horatio drowned his grief and work pouring himself into rebuilding the city and assisting the 100 000 people who had been left homeless by November of 1873 he decided it was time to take his wife and daughters to Europe Horatio loved the preaching of his friend and evangelist D.L Moody and the music of Iris Sankey he planned to visit their meetings in England and then enjoy a much-needed vacation as they were about to leave an urgent business matter detained Horatio in New York he decided to send his wife Anna and their four daughters Maggie Tanetta Anna and Bessie on ahead as he saw them settled into the cabin aboard the luxurious French liner vildehoove and unease filled his mind and he moved them to a room closer to the bow of the ship he kissed them goodbye promising to join them soon during the late night hours of November 22nd 1873 as the vilda who've glided over smooth Seas the passengers were jolted from their bunks the ship had collided with an iron sailing vessel and water poured in like Niagara Falls The Village who tilted Dangerously screams and prayers merged into a nightmare of unmeasured Terror passengers clung to post tumble through the darkness and were Swept Away by powerful currents of the icy Atlantic Ocean loved ones fell from each other's grasp and disappeared into foaming blacks the mighty ship vanished beneath the waters the 226 fatalities included all his daughters Maggie Panetta Anna and Bessie they were gone beneath the waves Mrs spafford was found nearly unconscious clinging to a piece of wreckage when the 47 survivors landed in Cardiff Wales she cabled her husband saved alone Horatio immediately booked passage to join his wife and root on a cold December night the captain called him aside and said I believe we are now passing over the place where the vilde hoove went down shock sadness and despair filled spafford's heart as he went to his cabin and those lonely moments of the night the spirit of God spoke words of Hope to him as he said to himself it is well the will of God be done he later wrote this famous hymn based on those words its word to become a Beacon of Hope to all those that have suffered loss [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] when peace

God bless you you can be seated for just a moment we've got a baby dedication brother Caleb and sister Brittany Lawson I'd like to bring their newborn and also they've got a another daughter that's a couple years old they let them dedicate to him both today to the Lord if they would just kind of bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the little ones [Music] what do you think about this new sister yeah you like it yeah yeah let's just pray together Heavenly Father our brother and sister they realize they have a great responsibility in these two daughters of theirs to try to raise them teach them to be able to make them as best as they possibly can ultimately we know that when our children come to the spot that they will begin to make decisions for themselves but they want to do everything they can to try to help them and lead them in the right way today Lord God they feel in their heart that they want to bring them to you and ask of your great counsel and guidance You're The Giver of Life You're The Giver of these children to their charge we bring them before you today Lord and we dedicate their little lives to you we pray father of time with Terry that they would be old enough to be able to make the choice of their soul destination they will be able to make it while they're young before the evil days would come upon them I pray for my sister that you would help her Lord that she can be the Fifth Gospel and Living Color May the spirit of God help my brother to be able to be the right kind of father the right kind of example Lord God whenever we stand there that day we want to look and there'll be those two not baby and a little three-year-old the two beautiful women that have served God and given their life to you and they will through eternity look to that mother and father and say thank you so much we commit them to you today Father in the name of the Lord Jesus amen thank you ready to sleep you're welcome God bless you to stand together certainly appreciate the goodness of the Lord to us today all of his mercy and all that he's done for us we've got so much to praise him for don't we so many wonderful things that he's done Romans chapter 8 verse 16. well you're turning there Carol and I would like to express our appreciation for all the birthday cards and gifts and um wedding anniversary cards and all of that we thank you so much for that but for more than that we thank you for your prayers we thank you for loving us and putting up with us thank you for what you mean to us from our hearts let us read from the book of Romans chapter 8 verse 16. we're just speaking about the bride's rights for several Services now and would like to continue them the right to reign with him as all rights are you have to fight for them of course some of them are more difficult to attain than others some of them will a great portion of their happening will be by Divine Providence but there's much of it that God will incorporate our own lives into and make it blend together the Divine side and The Human Side let's listen at the great inspired servant of God righteousness in Romans chapter 8 verse 16. the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God if you have that today you ought to be one of the happiest people in all the Earth that the spirit Bears a witness with your spirit that you're a child of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ but now listen how this is correlated together not only with sovereignty but with something else if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so we are Heirs of God John Heirs of Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature listen to this now wait us for the manifestation of the sons of God and his longing for that day I may like to be remembered today before the Lord in prayer I certainly appreciate you remember Eric if you would since you had that Bob said the other day she had been having quite a bit of pain um not sure exactly where it's coming from but we stopped to pray for it today before we came to church sort of like in her pancreas maybe but today moving up into her shoulders but we believe our God is greater than all pain don't we this is approaching now Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your love and grace to us today we thank you for the opportunity that we can be gathered together here Lord we've realized you're gone that we're living in the closing hours of the Gentile history we desire Our Lives to be pleasing to you more than anything else in this world we desire father that we would be able to obtain all of our rights given to us by the Blessed Son of God for we know it was you who purchased our right to be saved our right to be Sanctified our right to be justified to be filled with the Holy Ghost all of these great things you purchased it freely given it to us and we're so thankful and yet we know and obtaining those it's like many of our rights as an American citizen there may come times that we will have to fight for them because people will try to take them away so I pray that you would help us today Lord as we look into your words you saw the hundreds of hands that were uplifted signifying a need or many would you be mindful of them today Lord speak to every heart we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen God bless you you may be seated turn with me to Second Corinthians chapter 2 if you would verse 14. all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redowned to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory this is certainly not the words of a man who had it easy all of his life certainly not a man that since he had become a child of God and then of course become a preacher and become the first church AIDS messenger in this first Ephesian age it's not the words of a man that had everybody to like him everybody thought he was this great fellow it was not the words of an individual who had served god without a lot of Heartache but we hear from his pen from the words inspired by the suffering in his body spirit and soul that this is a man by this time in his ministry now it's around 55 60 A.D something like that he doesn't have too many more years before they're going to cut his head off he's went through more than Could Be Imagined he suffered so much for the gospel sake now we know he went through a lot no doubt like all of us have because of his own shortcomings he dealt with remembering short things that he had done he dealt with all of those that he had persecuted for the cause of Christ they live for the Lord and he hated the Lord Jesus at the time no doubt he would remember over and over again I've wondered myself how many times Paul would lay at night and could not sleep and he would see the faces of the martyrs that he had caused to die for the gospel I wonder how many times that he relived as those that was having their heads bashed in with stones and being imprisoned all that he'd done that of course was not for the glory of God but that was his own mistakes but how much now has it changed since he's become a prisoner of the gospel and because of that he's went through so much stuff for the Lord Jesus and we know ourselves that once we become Servants of the Living God Children of the purpose of almighty God there will be so much that we will go through which we have absolutely nothing to do with ourself it's not our mistakes it's not our frailties it's not even us reaping for past sins but it's something that has been attributed by the grace of God to our life now you and I may not think it's a blessing that God would give us such things but yet in reality it is because there's something about the path to Glory that is Laden with a heavy load of a cross there's something about the correlation of the weight of our cross in time that will bear out to the reflection of the crown that we'll receive on the other side now of course in this layout of cnh people want a crown they want to be honored of course in the resurrection they want their deeds to be resounded before everybody they want the mind what they've done to be put upon a great large screen and you bought somebody a meal one time you did this and that and the other that's typical for Leia to sins they want to be recognized and what they do they want it to be resounded from the housetops all but do they realize in order to wear a crown that day there will be such a weight on the human before they ever get there how God would measure the size the glory the Effigy of your crown by the burden related here in this life even our reward which will be given to us will be measured by The Works that we have done for his cause now notice in second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 3. Paul speaking about himself and about others and he particularly goes to the ministry here and he says giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed it's just too sad that a lot of preachers don't carry out this same verse now notice he realizes the value God calls a man and then God gives a man that gift and that ability and much of what will become of that gift is not just about God but it's about the man himself I will apply himself what will he do with it now Paul realizes that offenses can be brought on the ministry by the ministry themselves so it says giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed now we realize in our ranks there's many people that don't even believe in Ministry and a lot of them it's no wonder it's no wonder what they've seen the way they've been treated by preachers and the things that preachers have done the doctrines that they've done and all that sort of thing but that does not change that God still has a holy ghost film Ministry and yet them preachers if they would only recognize as Paul did giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the Ministers of God so it's not just for you to prove me it's not for God to prove me but I am to prove myself so is every other god-called man now that part the Holy Ghost will not do the angels will not do and it's not your responsibility to do but it is my responsibility I will answer that day to the Lord for what I have done was what he's given me I realize that I have much to be accountable for if I had only this visible audience with hundreds of people here today but I have also the invisible possible audience which stream us which many of them have no church to go to I have hundreds times hundreds way more than what you see here today that I will give an account for then you go beyond that of those who feed from our church that have churches of their own I have thousands times thousands I have to answer to God for and let me set this way any man that wants that without a call from God is an absolute idiot he ain't got a lick of sense to realize the responsibility each one of you fathers that God will make you answer for the direction of your home for you husbands that will give an account for your why and for your children it's a great thing to answer for is it not so Paul then look as that as it Beyond just he was not a married man did not have children but he recognized as a messenger a church age messenger he had so much he would be accountable for if he led the church in one error of a false Doctrine if they followed his example in some way of something that he did wrong and there might be thousands of people that would follow in that error because they had confidence in him it's a very scary thing now notice he said but in all things approving ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in Necessities in distresses notice now this is a man that is filled with the Holy Ghost a man who loves God with all of his heart but look at what he's going through as a minister proving ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in Necessities in distresses again he says in stripes in imprisonments in tomats in labors and watchings and fastings listen what this man have been through so we're not talking about a man that just went through some Seminary College somewhere he was never reproached for the gospel never hated you realize a lot of the men that are preaching on this day they for the most part heart have had hardly no absolutely no difficulty whatsoever they've not been persecuted for the cause of Christ their life has not been threatened by people who would look for an advantage to kill them because of what they preached for they have never been threatened in any way demons don't bother them people don't bother them hell is not out to get them they have this easy road that is paved before them because they preach only things that are going to make people feel good they're never going to cross people they're never going to tell people if you don't get right with God you're going to hell I ain't going to say nothing like that not in the day we're living in Preachers are looking for the easy way out I'll tell you one thing I'd rather be hated and despise and talked about and misunderstood and when I stand before the law Lord that he says well done then beloved by everybody that ever hears me and people Pat me on the back and said what a wonderful man that guy I'm telling you what he he just loves everybody if love means not telling them the truth that ain't real love I would rather people misunderstand me and even not even like me and yet for me to stand before the Lord and him say Well done then for everybody and their brother to Pat me on the back and say oh my what a great man what a great man and then me stand before the Lord and him look at me in the face and say you are a false prophet you are going to hell at not only you but thousands of people you are responsible for not me brother sister no sir I'm going to tell you the truth if you get so mad at me you'd feel like smacking me on the face but one day you'll hug the net now notice Paul doesn't just leave it in the sad difficult side of verse four and five but look in verse 6 how he takes a different Avenue by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love unfeigned now you would come to a very peculiar verse in second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 5. there's no other writer in the New Testament that says it quite in this way and Paul must have had a real insight into this that not only by the inspiration of the spirit of God but I personally believe by dealing within his everyday walk so he said as the sufferings of Christ abound in US so our consolation also abound Us by Christ I want you to notice how he coins this term he does not say suffering things for Christ read it but he says for as the sufferings of Christ so many true Christians are not just suffering for Christ it is actually Christ's sufferings in them it is him living out now we believe that all of our hearts that he's living out the miraculous do we not these sounds shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils and lay hands on the sick we see that do we not we see those things but how many of us want the sufferings of Christ as well as the signs of Christ now notice again the word that he uses here whenever he he words this as the sufferings of Christ abound now this word is a Greek word that was used of a flower or it could be on a tree or it could be on a bush or it could be a flower that comes up out of the ground and it defines the stages of the flower how that when the flowers were first break force and you can barely see a tiny tiny peak of color and then the leaves around that or the covering on the outside would protect it it's not in its Glory yet but you can see it is a flower it's going to make a beautiful flower so this was a Greek word that was used of the flower coming from that primitive hidden stage and then it starts opening up day by day by day it opens and it opens and then the little coverings on the outside begin to turn down as that as they turned down then they begin to magnify the yellow or the red or the pink or the purple of the flower this was the word that Paul used that it was abounding so it was slowly unfolding and he said this is what the sufferings of Christ will do in his true body now not everybody that claims to be a Christian but it's like the sufferings of Christ will start be molded in that child of God's life and as they grow they will begin to abound and God will find them faithful and more faithful and more true and more committed and as they grow the abounding of the suffering of Christ begins to unfold itself in their life then that which was hidden becomes revealed and the Mystery the The Mystery of the color that was on the inside of that it begins to become magnified as each trial and each test begins to lay yourself backwards and the little petals begin to unfold oh I pray that God can find that in our lives as well I don't want to just stand before in that day and say Donnie you laid hands on a bunch of people with cancer and they were made well I see you built churches in Uganda you built churches in Kenya you built churches here you've done this and that and the other I don't want just him to say that about me I want him to say I saw the abounding glory of my sufferings in your life even though you did not understand even though it was not your choice you did not shirk when I put you into a position to where you knew that if you preach this and this and this you would lose many friends and you could have chose to left that out of your notes you could have chosen not to say this or that or the other but you said it anyway because I inspired you little did you know that would abound more and more to the glory of God now listen what Paul said as the sufferings of Christ nor for but of Christ abound in us so our consolation also abound Us by Christ that's a peculiar sin who would have ever thought that trials abounding in our life sufferings of Christ would turn right around and cause Comfort to also abound in our lives for us to comfort ourselves no to comfort others so Trials come and it brings such difficulty and hardship but if we will allow it it will turn it right around and it will produce consolation I was talking to Lance yesterday my son-in-law and he was telling me Brother Don you know this has really done something for me in the way that it's changed me about Erica and he said before I would hear of people with cancer going through this and that I would feel sorry for him he said but not like now so whenever I hear of someone going through something he said I not only think of the person that is sick but I think of the caregivers now why would he sing of the caregiver because he is one as a matter of fact he's taken a leave from work for almost three months so that he could be with Erica because Erica wanted him to be there by her side he's been a faithful husband so that opened up how by reading about it no by walking in that position and then watch what it does it will begin to abound so the petals have begin to unfold himself every request that I get from around the world of someone who requests for prayer was cancer I always forward that to Erica you know why she knows it better than I do how them people need prayer and you know when you've gone through something say it's it's dimacular something with your eyes and you're degenerating or say it's a kidney stone say it's a blood pressure and when the request is read from behind the pulpit remember so and so they're dealing with high blood and you're saying oh Lord I know how that feels Lord I know that kidney stone Lord I know a wayward son I know that so there's something about what we go through that begins to abound in our lives and it's not just for this life itself but it is actually leading us to a glory that will be revealed in us at that day now the Greek word that Paul uses here which I know means nothing to us as far as Greek but it's just an unusual word that he chose to use and it was parissa which means in us so the sufferings of Christ himself are actually reliving out of us so it's it's exemplifying itself through our lives you know it's no wonder that the prophet said that the church is not being persecuted and not suffering is not in the will of God Christ's suffering sin are represented as overflowing out of this word parissa it is overflowing so it's coming from the very heart of Christ can you imagine that we're saying healing and salvation and miracles and all of that oh sure we all want that coming from the heart of Christ but we're talking about a people that are going to reign with him remember John mentions in Revelation chapter 20 verse 5 and he mentions it in several place of Revelation chapter 1 verse 7 but when he talks about those that will rule and reign with Christ well how does that come about it does not come about by simply being given to us but there must be a character which will match our lord and there must be a union between us and Christ Jesus that we have suffered as being a child of God read with me in Philippians chapter 3 verse 10. Paul said that I may know him I'm the power of his resurrection now look at the very next words that he's says and the fellowship of his sufferings wow so you mean Paul wanted to know him in the power of his resurrection how many of us stopped there what is the power of his resurrection well a deposit of that is Divine Healing and miracles every person we see healed my husband you're an absolute tremendous Miracles and things that the Lord did in the prayer line that I'd like to share with you and what is those healings and miracles it is a deposit of the Resurrection but Paul didn't just have that but this man had a peculiar desire that he wanted to enter in again the word Fellowship here's coinia it's a very popular word used among the charismatic Christians in this day they name their churches and their fellowships and so on after this it's the word koinia because it means joining together having something in common so Paul didn't just want signs wonders Miracles healings discernment and all that but Paul said I want to be the type of individual that if God looked for somebody to enter into Fellowship of suffering that I would not be one that would turn my back and run away but I want to be oh my I want to be one so in love with the Lord Jesus that he if he chose me to fellowship with him in suffering I would say here are my Lord anybody else in here the same way well I don't expect you to raise your hands one at one at a time but you'll think about it you will now notice that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his deaths now he wanted to go so deep into the sufferings of Christ in this peculiar statement brother Paul that a man would desire to enter into the fellowship of Christ's sufferings even made to conformable to the deaths of the Lord Jesus Colossians chapter 1 verse 24 who now rejoice in my sufferings I want you he separates the sufferings of Christ and he identifies them as his own who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and Philip that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh the afflictions of Christ in my flesh again it's like he's setting it for us that it's reliving brother Pete reliving the very afflictions of the Lord Jesus in his body this should help you to understand that this man when he first met the Lord Jesus and whatever he asked Lord who are you and he said I'm Jesus who you're persecuting how who was he persecuting the body of Christ so Christ was living out in his body in so much that he took the persecution that Paul was rendering to the church members the apostolic Christians and he said you are persecuting me If people could only get this in their head when you are persecuting or making it hard on a daughter of God you are persecuting the Lord Jesus when you are causing a son or daughter of God a hard time do you understand what you are doing you are making it hard personally on the Lord Jesus himself that ought to make us treat one another a whole lot better shouldn't it now notice that he says so I I've entered in let me go back and read it again who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body saved now Paul realizes much of what he's going through it's not just for himself but it's a joint Union of himself and of the church he said Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church so Paul identifies the body of the Lord Jesus as the church so every person that persecutes you and I every person that lies and runs us down as burden and difficulty and so on they are persecuting the body of the Lord Jesus you imagine how it's going to be when they stand before in that day and he said hey why did you run me down why did you tell this line me why did you do this and that well Lord I've never even seen you oh yes you did because you've done that so Donnie you've done that to Paul you've done that to Janet you've done that to Carol you've done that to Zach you don't know that that wasn't you but it was me in my bride form so because you did that to them now you're going to answer to me for what you've done Lord God help me to never have to stand before the Lord that way and the church said so suffering look at it ah that little friend don't expect me to be able to explain to you how it all works because I don't understand it myself but suffering is the beaten path to Glory suffering is the beaten path to glory and that which will make it more and more and more glorious on that Resurrection morning you see Glory must have something to be able to compare itself against it's like we're living under the law of contrast so we have a day like and then before long we'll have night time we have Sunshine we have rain we have good days we have bad days we have days so we fill out my we never have a trial and on those other days you feel like you can't get your head above the water is that right what is that the law of contrast what will make your glory now I can't go in this two Farm because I don't go over your head but there will be a an element of God's glory the Greek word doesn't the New Testament used for Glory it's doxa and it is something about the personage of deity that will be shared with his people now I believe according to what happened to Moses out in the Old Testament that Moses entered into the pillar of fire when he come out they had to put a veil on Moses face because his flesh Shone with the glory of God and that was just the revealing of the law what would it be when we get our glorified bodies and we're in the presence of God what's one thing that's going to make you different as the bride than the church an anxious you living in the city it's going to be part of your appearance it's going to be part of you entering into the glory of God that which you bypass to come here as a mortal remember a mount Transfiguration what did Jesus do he was allowed to enter back into momentarily what he was before he became a human so he was allowed to enter into that Glory which he had with the Father which was his desire to go back into he said I proceeded forth and came from God and I go back to God not to his but another Throne ain't no two Thrones in heaven there's only one but he was God and he condescended from being that to become a man but it went back to being God again you were assault a part of God's Great thinking that is deity just like God's thought of Christ to us because God has thoughts in his mind that are only for time God has thoughts in his mind that are only about the universe and say certain things in our Earth that in the new Earth will not be here at all but there are other thoughts that God has in his mind which are Eternal they are identified in the godhead they are part of the godhead associated with him oh I wish somebody would hear me preach this morning if you have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what that is that is your portion of the godhead oh what in the world are you talking about brother Donnie it is God himself living in you I'm talking about in a baptism I ain't talking about in a gift I'm talking about your portion of him remember you are Heirs of God which means you get God you don't get just a fine fancy Council to live in you don't get no Palace you get God himself praise the Lord but how how will we get to that that spot leaving from this Mortal life well suffering will be along the path by which we're projected up into that glory and the suffering in this life you see this is why the martyrs will receive what is identified in the New Testament as a Martyrs crowd you and I will never share that what's it mean it's got more stars it's got more gold more silver no but it is a reflection of the glory of God that they paid the ultimate price and you imagine now prophet of God that lived for years and years of his life and gave so much for the cause will you and I receive a reward like them absolutely not but every one of us will receive the reward that will match what we were here in time and some people's reward it will be given to them it will be great it will be exceeding and tremendous and because it was a preacher say and they lived their life for decades and they serve God's people and they went through so much stuff but most of what they went through were for the cause of Christ not for anything they done themselves so the Lord will reward them accordingly you understand there will be others they will be associated with the great Supernatural Miracle as a man in John 9 that we look at last Sunday when the disciples said which one of these sin this man or his parents Jesus said neither but that the works of God might be made manifest in his life this man gave up years and years of seeing gave up years and years of a vocation gave up years and years of a family all types of things he gave up so the glory of God could be made manifest in his life he was never a preacher he was never a trustee he's fortunately no never a church-aged messenger but no doubt that man will be rewarded his life has been preached for 2 000 years we don't even know what his name was how many people has been healed by reading this story about this man in John 9. how many people have used this man as an encouragement God wrote in this man's life a great portion of his own glory and that man was just a poor blind beggar that no doubt people would walk by and they had all kinds of thoughts don't sit there and look at me like you don't do the same thing when you pass people on the side of the road and they got a sign we'll work God bless I'm a vet I'm this and that the other and part of them may be that you don't know but because there's people out there that's Liars we look at them and say yeah right he probably makes more money than I do I ain't giving him no dollar so what do you do you seek evil or you sing bad and then no doubt they did that man the same way that the glory of God could be made manifest in his life oh my goodness so you see what happens in in this life's journey as Paul is relating it here how the what he went through and that the glory of God was going to be revealed in him in such a great way so by wearing and bearing the cross we are being fitted for the crown by carrying your cross whatever that is you are being fitted for your crown if there is no cross there is no Crown can't you see why the multitudes that will live outside the city and many of them receive no reward whatsoever because their works are sown in concepts of denominational ideas which are not even scriptural they will be saved but they will live outside the city with no reward they will never be rewarded they don't even get the honor to live in the city itself but they will come up from New Moon to New Moon and Sabbath and so on and when they walk in the city watch some of the glory they're going to see you you imagine if they come up by them great gigantic Gates of pearl onto the streets of gold and they see some of the saints of God who are allowed to live inside this city all the time and they will see from your image projecting part of the glory of God little children that does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him like him how are we going to be like him we're going to have fingers we're going to have toes yeah but we are also going to Bear the image of the Shekinah Glory of God why because we have already already been sized for our Crown according to the size of our cross so in this age when people want the crown but they don't want to cross they don't want to be reproached for being a Christian Life God for being a Christian guess how big their Crown is same size as their cross so what about those that go through so much stuff for the glory of God not just preachers but Christians who bow the reproach and God identifies them perfect can you imagine the Lord Jesus that is sick person and they're in bed and they're going to this and that in the other and God has a purpose for their life a miracle that is in the making and that's actually Christ Jesus is identifying that person with bearing his own sufferings so it's as if Jesus himself is suffering again the sufferings of Christ don't be despondent you're being measured for your crown Oh Glory to God what about the body it becomes so difficult I know it does friends I know it can become so difficult I know that the pain whether physically psychologically mentally can be so difficult the reproach can be so hard to bear but how can I have confidence that God will will help me that he won't let me go through more than what I'm able to Bear well first of all his word tells us that secondly we can look at the examples that have been before us we can read sought in with the Old Testament and find of those great Patriarchs of Faith who live lives that were even without the spirit of God in the Old Testament but that love the Lord and God kept them and the church said if you haven't heard this message in a while it do you good to read it or listen to it this is one of my favorites and has been since I came to the message many many years ago and whenever I get kind of despondent life and down and all that sort of thing oh brother don't you mean you do yeah just like all the rest of you do I go to this one now the prophet preached this twice he preached it once in 1958 in Jeffersonville and he gave it a little different title and this one is the sunrise service in the 1960 and he entitled it I know done in the 1958 he called it I know my redeemer liveth now I want you to listen this and let us let us end up on this part here in a bit he could not drown Noah in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished now there's some words I want you to notice in these next few pages that we're going to share until and after and then we'll go to the next one until and after now watch he could not drown Noah in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished he could not burn up the children of Israel until the Hebrew children the purpose of God had been finished he could not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of God had been finished he kept my thought neither could the lions eat Daniel until God's purpose had been finished neither could death and old age take Abraham until the purpose of God had been finished now let's bring her home neither can he take you oh hallelujah or take me until the purpose of God of our life is finished so we gather from their consolation so Satan could not take Noah he could not take Abraham he could not take Isaac he could not take Sarah he cannot take you I think we need a certain notice on the devil today that we know where we are standing and we know our life is in the hands of almighty God the devil is not our Master we don't serve him he cannot do with us as he pleases he cannot take us until let me just go ahead and add a few more names the devil cannot take Dan Robbins until the devil is until God is done with it the devil cannot take Erica Parker until God is done with her the devil cannot take Michael Brown until God is done with it the devil cannot take peace losses he cannot take you or you or you or you until the purpose of God is God with your life so like it or not devil that's just the truth [Applause] anybody see which door he went out I want you to listen to this next quote why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble what an odd statement so harness it's what you put on an animal to pull something or tote something a horse a mule if it's a small enough load a goat so you have a harness made and then you hook it to this animal and then the animal is to transport this whatever it is from point A to point B look at how the prophet of God identifies what trouble is why does God let troubles come he harnesses trouble I said stand still trouble and God puts bits in trouble's mouths now if you've ever had very many horses we all could have named one or two of them at least trouble because boy I tell you one thing when you head toward him with a bit some of them oh my goodness how they like to carry off you'll think that old plug horse ain't fit for nothing he won't do the same take the Bridle toward him and you'll see how much life he's got that right Brookfield yeah that's the way it is well sometimes God not an amazing that God doesn't harness healing God doesn't harness Miracles God doesn't Harner great finances and great pride and great arrogance and this and that and the other and God grabs a hold of Pride and say come here now let me set my preacher writer apparently let everybody yeah yeah yeah here he come Glory Glory Hallelujah oh my my that's what a lot of support and then God harnesses Pride come here pride and the preacher's gonna suffer oh you're a six foot pile of dirt and I call the rest of us but God harnesses trouble and then he puts bits troubles mouth a trouble saying all about and you're standing there scared to death because you said oh Lord that's my buggy why did God pick my burger and heart is trouble he's harnessing trouble go on papers God's harness and trouble to my buddy oh no I was wanting Prosperity I was wanting a new car I was wanting a new home I was wanting this out God God you got the wrong body that's by the Harrisburg eating not mine that's Sister Janice beg you Lord you got the wrong about you God said I know which buggy I want I've got the right buggy I've got the right trouble I've got the right difficulty but I've got the right in his mouth hmm so God harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and somebody said and those troubles bring us into a closer Fellowship with God how many has had it to happen to you you pray Mormon you got trouble or more than you got less trouble which I'll praise the most you're probably the most and everything's going good right no hardships no difficult everybody loves you that's when you pray the most no you don't you pray the most whenever things that's going on that you don't understand things you think you can go through well God harness that trouble and God hits it up to your beautiful little Cadillac there have been no rainbow until look at this word until think of it oh my I was headed out the other day after these flooding rains that we've had and I was going out of the neighborhood there and I I took a picture always absolutely beautiful a rainbow saying almost vertical like like that and it was standing right up in the clouds The Creeks was flooded all kinds of stuff going on everywhere and I thought yeah I took a picture of it and sent it to Carolyn I said look God still remembers his promise she said yes he does and he still remembers his promise concerning our daughter too she said he's going to heal her make her well well that's her profession of Faith so God remember so that after all the storm that there had been no beautiful of the seven colors of the rainbow until the flood came after Noah was pressed into that condition he was in to float 40 days a night in a storm and a little art pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of promise at your head went through the tribulation then he saw the promise all friends I hope you understand today that's exactly the way God does in our life how we want to see a rainbow we want to see this we want to see that but before we can see that we've got to see these other things out your head went through the tribulation he saw the promise that's the way you see the Promise after you've gone through the tribulation it wasn't until the Hebrew children were forced into the fiery furnace one of the most outstanding trials they've seen one like the Son of God standing among them listen to this their troubles produced wow [Applause] their troubles produced did it for you sister Becky your trouble produced what the mighty Son of God how many of us is a witness here today that you went through this and that and the other but if it had not been for your trouble he wouldn't have showed up like he did Oh Glory to God came we see he will make all things work together for the good to them who love the Lord their troubles not their faith not their jumping not their shouting their troubles when it got absolutely to a spot it was totally impossible for any Earthly Deliverance can you imagine Florence Nightingale being so far gone oh my those of you that have seen the pictures of that woman when the prophet of God prayed for her it's hard to believe that a human being could live in that kind of state and yet the spirit of God something in her with no hope my my floor to South Africa and the spirit of God give the prophet an opportunity to be able to pray for and here come God in the form of a dove a little Dove sitting over there hallelujah what was it her trouble produced the son of God her trouble her sickness her disease her hopelessness her hopelessness produces Son of God or if we could only get it today we'd realize when we get down so low we say oh no we're too far gone there's no hope left yes there is he may have been waiting for that very time when your hopelessness would produce the greatest Miracle you've ever seen in your life oh thank you Lord thank you Lord their troubles produced the son of God standing among them in breezes to wave away the heat wave praise God but not until they went into the fire that that comforter appear so I wonder if we could gather them here today and ask him Shad wrapped me shock and Abednego was you boys terrified yes sir brother Donnie we were scared T totally to death we wasn't sure that our God would deliver us we didn't even know you know they said that we're not even sure our God will deliver us but that's one thing we do no we're not bound to that image we don't know for sure what he's going to do but if we'd say would y'all do it again again and again and again and again because what we saw in that fiery furnace has been preached about for thousands of years it was the most awesome thing you can imagine the men who threw us in there they were scalded they were like fried eggs and we went flying right in the middle of that we didn't even break out in the sweat as a matter of fact Brother Don you're sweating more than we was that day because all of a sudden we got inside of there and it was like a great big air conditioning I remember this was pre-air conditioned brother William so there was no AC inside of there and headed down about 55 but the spirit of God come down Hallelujah the spirit of God came down and began to Fan off him oh boys they said I'm getting a little chilly in here him I got a jacket and the Old Kingston on the outside said did not we cast them sorry they said that's true so great well he said how come it is I see four and the form of the force is like unto the Son of God it was their troubles that produced the manifestation of the son of God oh are there any Christians that want to be like them guys that God will allow you to go to an impossible State and allow you to go to a position where you think there's no way out absolutely no way and then Jesus says pardon me will glory glory well Hallelujah oh since I'm lame well they're still alive they're not fried like ribeyes they're not even like pork ribs they standing right up there and there's another one in the midst of them what in the world produced it their troubles or was somebody over here that was Daniel who purposed in his heart that he had not defiled himself with the things of the world I was forced through a trawl where they had prayed to God or go into a lion's den it was after the heat was put on and he was thrown into the lines then after that he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the midst of him Erica told me before service on the prayer line she said Daddy hope it don't sound selfish but I don't want to be the first one prayed for I said okay no problem she said my need is so great she said would you care to ask brother Ron brother Tim I know the anointing really gets to move it but he called for me there I said yep sure so I told Brother wrong before service he interns spoke to Brother JD he said Brother JD whenever I let you know bring her out so we pray for many I don't know how many we prayed for but you know what motivated him to call her because an angel was standing right there so when he comes great things happen not look friends I believe the angels of God are still Among Us he was seen at the other church this is twice has been seen at the new one I'm glad to be able to go to church or angels are welcome I'm really glad to go to church for our angels are welcome Hallelujah and it wasn't just for Erica's need that he showed up but there was many many others who had great needs and what did it do your needs about the angel of the Lord I believe they're right here this morning as a matter of fact I believe the Bible tells us they can't round about a smile when you go to work for that when you go to home they're there when you go to church so that they don't never leave you they all right there but there's certain times you need such a visitation and it is your distress it is your trouble it is your heart and your sorrow that brings them on the scene and they are there because of you Oh Glory to God I imagine as a man Daniel was afraid I imagine there's a man that he felt so alarmed how is it possible for anyone to ever live past them power of those mouths lions or their mouths and the breaking power of the force hundreds of pounds per square inch in their jaws as they would crush these bones but Daniel's need brought the angel of God well it's no less the day whenever the doctor said well I'll tell you one thing your report didn't come back very good we've got this and that and the other going on with you and I'm afraid you're at the end of your road and the angel said into the road that sounds like my cue that sounds like what I'm supposed to manifest myself right now I'm supposed to go down the end of the road last days uh prepare you're at the end of life yep sometimes that's it we want him to come and start start we want him to come even before one you know zero we wanted to come in Deliverance but what if he's got a purpose in mind that the glory of God will be magnified 50 times over if you'll bear something for three years if you would bear something for four years and it would bring him a thousand times more glory and make medical science testify we don't know we don't know like a man who got a prayer cloth from the prayer line here on Saturday night had one order 100 another 80 percent they did a stent and one is going back for the Nether and they took him in for the procedure took a prayer cloth and come back out my doctor said I don't know how to explain it and I don't know what's going on I don't know what took place but he don't need to see it no more well what was it it's a need it's a need and it brings him on the sea but we've got to have needs we've got to have hungers we've got to have desires and then we say Lord all right everything's set everything's fell through the buildings collapsed the walls just fell down no more doctors no more hope no more this no more that I'm on your hands Jesus I'm on your hands Jesus and that's why the prophet said you pray day and night you prayed I'm afraid I'll wear him out no I'll tell you what the prophet said about that when he's talking about the little woman that had the daughter that was so sick and also the woman of the unjust judge he said you say to Jesus he said Jesus are you getting tired of hearing me because I'm sure having a good time talking to you I'm talking day and night I'm talking in the noontime I ain't never gonna let this down till you answer me I'm on your hand that woman come to the unjustice she knocked and knocked and knocked and not whatever you got neither today don't pray one time and stop don't pray one time and quit keep on praying and pray it I'm praying I believe it I'm knocking I'm knocking Deliverance is on my way healing is on my way I will not give up I will not give up never listen the prophet said the Lions could not get him because it went through the trials and The Temptations and the troubles he knew that his God was able to deliver him from that it was Abraham after he'd seen the ground get Barren and the drought come and lots separate himself and go down to live deliciously into the world notice what all happened to Abraham the crown was Barren the Shepherds was fussing and fight the prophet tells us anything to our the Lord told us in 1960 he said I could just imagine Sarah that day she got up in a bad mood of course I don't have none of us but I'm just saying Sarah you know she got up in a bad mood that day and the crops is all bad there wasn't hardly no water and he said little did they know God had just come down the road a little ways and stepped into a human body but it's when everything was so far gone there was no hope it's amazing though when we get to that spot we're right at the last step before he delivers and we give up the very thing that's fixing to producing is the very thing we say well there's no hope on the Dickens Brothers wives had a dream this week about Erica and they said he wasn't saying it was the Lord anyone said it was God or nothing like that but she was in the hospital all of her family was gathered around her we was crying they basically give her no hope we couldn't hardly even understand anything just say it but from a faint voice she said I'm here I'm Healed I'm Healed I remember ordering and according to the dream she sat right straight up in the bed just our cat and said I'm here [Applause] and guess what she was here sometimes you get that while you say why does he do it that produces the son of God then he will have to make the doctor say and testify only God only God can do that I'm in heaven he today Oh Glory to God Hallelujah let's wear our heads if you would humanly we probably would all more than likely say we we don't really care for the way you do some of these things sometimes because unlike us you don't get nervous you don't get jittery but Lord we do we we just have to be honest we get nervous and when it gets down they're so close we think oh Lord are you going to show up or not I don't know why we do because you always do you always have you always show up on time but you know how we are as Mortals Lord God for every person that's standing here today and those under the sound of my voice wherever they are whatever they're going through maybe some of them right now those soldiers have got their hands on their arms and the furnace door is open and they're fixing to throw me maybe they're like Daniel the doors then been opened oh my and they've already been thrown in and standing there at the entrance to the door of the cave Shivers is running up and down his spine I said lions come toward him the Hebrew children and the fiery furnaces they feel the heat as they start to approach and the next thing they walk into this air-conditioned fiery field furnace as far as I know you're the only one who's ever been able to produce such a thing that the temperature was thousands of degrees by an internal fire and then men were as cool as cool now Lord that's that kind of cool I want to be this age wants to be cool that's what kind of cool I want that's the cool I want in the middle of my troubles that's the cool I want in the middle of my trials Lord God whatever they're facing today Lord Jesus sickness disease depression sadness Financial things marital problems whatever it is Lord May the spirit of God come to their house today oh Lord God in the name of Jesus may you visit their house father we believe your word we testify that you are the same yesterday today and forever there would have been no rainbow had there not been a flood there would have been no miracle If Abraham would have been able to father a child at 35 and his wife at 25. but what a miracle it was at 110 and 100 90 and 100 80 90 still believe in God taking God at his word Lord Jesus we call you on the scene today Father right now in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God go to the hearts
