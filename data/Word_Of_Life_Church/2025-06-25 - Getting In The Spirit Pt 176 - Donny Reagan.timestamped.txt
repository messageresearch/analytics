[6:59] [Music]
[7:11] Four years
[7:13] I tried Travel
[7:16] a road
[7:19] all wrong.
[7:21] My heart
[7:24] had lost
[7:26] every joy,
[7:29] every song.
[7:32] Then grace
[7:34] it placed me
[7:37] right where I
[7:40] belong.

[8:42] miracles.
[8:45] My tears
[8:47] were turned into
[8:50] joy.

[10:07] My tears
[10:09] were turned into
[10:12] joy.
[10:17] My sins were

[11:27] pass down.
[11:31] God mercy
[11:34] reroll
[11:36] my life.
[11:41] [Applause]
[12:29] Someone asked me to sing this. It's not
[12:31] been too long since I sung it, but it's
[12:36] I love the song.
[12:38] Aren't you glad Mercy rewrote your life?
[12:41] I'm glad Mercy rewrote my life many
[12:44] times, even since I've been a Christian.
[12:46] He's never gave up on me.
[12:49] On a balcony
[12:53] of space
[12:56] stepped a pure
[12:59] and holy God.
[13:04] And in awome
[13:07] solitude
[13:09] he stood
[13:11] alone.
[13:17] Not one faint star
[13:20] to give him light,
[13:24] just endless rolling
[13:28] blackest night.
[13:32] But somehow
[13:35] through all the darkness
[13:38] [Music]
[13:39] he could see.
[13:46] He saw mountains
[13:49] high and lofty.
[13:53] He saw valleyies
[13:55] lush and green.
[14:00] Babbling brooks
[14:02] wild flowers growing.
[14:07] Even heard
[14:10] a robin sing.
[14:15] But he felt
[14:17] a strange
[14:19] compassion
[14:21] as close to love
[14:25] as pain could be.
[14:30] Standing out there
[14:33] in
[14:35] tomorrow.
[14:38] He
[14:40] saw
[14:42] me.
[14:44] [Music]
[14:48] He saw me
[14:51] in
[14:53] his likeness.
[14:56] He saw me
[15:00] like him.
[15:02] [Music]
[15:06] clean
[15:07] and holy,
[15:11] spotless
[15:12] white
[15:14] within.
[15:18] But he saw me bound
[15:21] in heavy chains
[15:25] and long
[15:28] to set me free.
[15:32] But he knew
[15:34] if I
[15:37] became
[15:39] like him,
[15:42] he
[15:43] must
[15:45] become like
[15:49] me.
[15:52] [Applause]
[15:55] So Jesus
[15:58] paid it all.
[16:03] All
[16:04] to him I owe.
[16:08] [Music]
[16:10] Sin
[16:11] had left a crimson stain,
[16:18] but he
[16:20] washed
[16:22] it white
[16:25] as snow.
[16:27] [Music]
[16:35] [Applause]
[16:44] God's
[16:47] grace.
[16:49] Grace that is greater
[16:54] than all
[16:57] my sins. Sing it. Oh, grace.
[17:04] Praise
[17:07] God.
[17:15] [Music]
[17:24] Oh,
[17:26] grad.
[17:27] [Music]
[17:35] Grace
[17:38] gra
[17:44] [Music]
[17:47] with
[17:51] grace
[17:57] God's
[18:00] grace
[18:11] Sing it again. Grace, grace, grace,
[18:18] amazing grace.
[18:24] Don't you thank God for grace? Praise
[18:29] will God
[18:33] [Music]
[18:39] [Laughter]
[18:42] [Music]
[18:52] grace
[18:54] is Gater
[18:57] than all
[19:00] I see.
[19:05] [Music]
[19:07] Let's just bow our heads tonight.
[19:12] Heavenly Father, how thankful we are for
[19:14] that tonight.
[19:16] If it wasn't for that, there wouldn't be
[19:19] a one of us saved.
[19:22] Furthermore, there wouldn't be one of us
[19:24] that even would want to be saved.
[19:28] We were born in such darkness. Even the
[19:31] seed of God was shadowed in such depths
[19:35] of anxiety and desperation and darkness.
[19:39] It looked like it was impossible for
[19:42] light to ever strike our soul. But you
[19:46] made a way. And for that we will be
[19:50] eternally grateful.
[19:52] Then Lord, we know that we don't do our
[19:55] works that we could try to pay you back
[20:00] because there's no way we could ever pay
[20:03] you back. And you don't want payment
[20:06] back.
[20:08] If we could just understand it correctly
[20:10] that we do works and things that you ask
[20:13] us to do because we love you and because
[20:17] we want to render obedience from a
[20:20] faithful and true heart to your word.
[20:24] But Lord Jesus, we are recipients of
[20:28] your mercy and grace. And there's not a
[20:30] one of us here tonight that's worthy as
[20:33] far as worthy. And any of us could say,
[20:36] "Well, I did this and I come from this
[20:38] family and my father did this, my
[20:40] grandfather." No, but it's your grace.
[20:44] We ask you tonight, Lord, that we would
[20:46] never we would never turn the grace of
[20:51] our God into lasciviousness
[20:55] and be abusers of grace. But may we
[20:58] always be appreciative and thankful
[21:01] every day of our life.
[21:04] Help us tonight as we look into your
[21:06] word. Father, you see the needs of your
[21:08] children. Help me to get out of the way.
[21:11] Bless us as we feed upon your word in
[21:14] the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. Praise
[21:18] the Lord. How many's happy to be in
[21:20] church on Wednesday night?
[21:23] Amen. What about the rest of you? Did
[21:27] y'all come for a hot dog or a hamburger
[21:29] or bag of tater chips?
[21:31] How many's happy to be in church on
[21:33] Wednesday night? All right. Praise the
[21:36] Lord.
[21:39] Praise the Lord. That's wonderful.
[21:41] Genesis 24:21.
[21:47] And the man wondering at her held his
[21:49] peace to whether the Lord had made his
[21:52] journey prosperous or not.
[21:55] And it came to pass as the camels had
[21:57] done drinking that the man took a golden
[22:00] earring of half a shekele weight and two
[22:03] bracelets for her hands and 10 shekels
[22:07] weight of gold.
[22:09] Verse 26.
[22:12] And the man bowed down his head
[22:17] and worshiped
[22:19] the Lord. The man bowed down his head
[22:24] and worshiped the Lord. May the Lord
[22:27] bless his word. You may be seated.
[22:32] Now it is said that Eleazar
[22:37] was a gentile,
[22:41] not a Jew.
[22:45] Not a Jew.
[22:47] So, he was a gentile
[22:50] that was sent to get a bride
[22:53] for Isaac.
[22:56] But there's something about this
[22:57] gentile. I know some of you looking at
[23:00] me funny. You want scripture? All right,
[23:03] honey. I got it for you. Genesis 15:2.
[23:07] And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou
[23:10] give me? Seeing I go
[23:14] in what country? Anybody know what?
[23:18] Syria. Syria.
[23:21] Syria.
[23:23] But there's something about this man
[23:26] being around the prophet Abraham.
[23:29] He picked up on some of Abraham's ways.
[23:35] Being a Syrian from Syria, which was
[23:39] idoltors.
[23:40] Now, think of it. The truth of the one
[23:44] God was not known around the world yet.
[23:49] It was
[23:51] polytheistic.
[23:52] You know what that means? That means
[23:54] they believed in more than one God.
[23:58] Abram was the first man in this time
[24:03] slot that God had started revealing to
[24:06] him monotheism
[24:09] which is believing in one God. Not three
[24:14] persons in one god but literally one
[24:17] God. So this servant, gentile servant
[24:24] had learned several valuable things from
[24:28] the prophet Abraham. And one of them was
[24:44] learned how to worship. I want you to
[24:46] notice how that the writer here of the
[24:49] book of Genesis which was Moses and how
[24:51] that he sets these things in order in
[24:54] what Eleazar and the man bowed down his
[24:59] head bowed down his head and worshiped
[25:04] the Lord. Now remember what he's done.
[25:08] He's asked her several questions and
[25:11] she's giving back the right answers.
[25:13] Now, I want you to also notice that he
[25:16] went looking for a bride for Isaac. Look
[25:21] at where he went and where he didn't go.
[25:26] He didn't go to a brothel.
[25:29] He did not go to a place to where
[25:33] ill-famed women by their reputation
[25:36] would have been gathering together. But
[25:39] he went to a well.
[25:43] A well. Now, it was not one that had a
[25:45] spot and they'd stand there, but it was
[25:48] one that a woman would go to, a woman
[25:52] that was faithful, a woman that would
[25:55] work, a woman that would go down the
[25:58] spiral, come back up, and remember, she
[26:00] wound up going approximately 60 times in
[26:05] order to water these camels. And I want
[26:08] you to notice that he didn't just tell
[26:11] her all the things. Now you got to do
[26:13] this and you got to do that and you got
[26:14] to do that and you got to do that and
[26:16] you got to do that. But he more so asked
[26:20] her questions than what he told her to
[26:24] do. But you see in this being around the
[26:28] influence of God's prophet, he had
[26:31] learned that if you'll be around people
[26:34] long enough, if you listen carefully,
[26:37] you can find out where they are and who
[26:41] they are. Now, I'll say it again, just
[26:44] reminding those of you that are looking
[26:46] for a girlfriend or a boyfriend, and
[26:48] whether you're 18 or 38 or 48 or 68,
[26:53] one of the greatest mistakes that many
[26:55] people make when they are interested in
[26:58] someone is they don't ask enough
[27:03] questions.
[27:05] They don't ask enough questions. But now
[27:09] this was Eleazar's calling card. Ask
[27:22] of yourself and not to live in hell on
[27:26] earth. Ask questions and ask a lot of
[27:29] them and don't be afraid to ask them.
[27:33] And one of the first ones that you could
[27:35] ask, if you're not sure who they are,
[27:38] ask them if they're a Christian.
[27:40] And if they tell you they're not, I want
[27:43] to know what in the world you're even
[27:47] doing considering
[27:49] such a one for a a companion or a date,
[27:53] as you call it, or a girlfriend or a
[27:57] boyfriend.
[27:59] Come on. Don't tell me y'all going to
[28:01] start out quiet on me already.
[28:04] Or you say, "Brother Donnie, I might be
[28:06] able to lead them to the Lord." And how
[28:08] is that going to work when you're
[28:10] compromising on the very foundation of
[28:13] your relationship?
[28:16] So, it's not them giving up the ground,
[28:20] it's you. Because God's word tells you
[28:23] to not join yourself with someone
[28:40] baptizing titles or are you baptized in
[28:43] the name of the Lord Jesus? Oh, brother
[28:45] Donnie, I'm not going to get into that
[28:47] because I'm going to win them to the
[28:49] Lord. Are you sure about that or will
[28:52] they win you? Now just remember there
[28:56] are people who have not followed God's
[28:59] pattern and they've married people that
[29:02] was not believers and God by his grace
[29:06] saved their companion but they are not
[29:09] supposed to be your example because
[29:12] there's not one promise in God's word
[29:15] that he is obligated to do such when you
[29:19] overstep his word. Well, I say I'm going
[29:23] to have to preach an amen myself too
[29:25] tonight. So, you see, whenever Eleazar
[29:28] was sent down there, it was absolutely
[29:32] vital and important that he go to ask
[29:35] him a bunch of questions. Now, he would
[29:37] have not showed up at a local Brussel or
[29:41] a place where you could hire a woman or
[29:44] a denominational prostitute
[29:47] and looking for a bride. But where did
[29:50] he go? He went to a well. What's he
[29:53] looking for? A woman that's not afraid
[29:56] of work. A woman that's sent there under
[29:59] the headship of her father. If she
[30:03] doesn't know how to obey her father,
[30:05] right, she won't know how to obey a
[30:08] husband, right? If she's a modernday
[30:12] painted Jezebel that's rebellious
[30:16] against the word and the leadership in
[30:18] the home under a father, what makes you
[30:21] young boys think shall ever be subject
[30:24] to you? Well, praise the Lord. So, where
[30:28] did he go? He went to the right place,
[30:31] the well. At the well is the water of
[30:35] life. at the well, good things can come
[30:39] forth. So, he goes to the right place
[30:42] looking for the right kind of woman. And
[30:45] he don't start handing out gold and
[30:47] silver cuz there ain't no telling who in
[30:50] the world you'll get if you do that
[30:51] first. But the first thing you go to
[30:54] doing is asking questions. And every
[30:57] question he asked her, she had the right
[31:00] answer. Are you a Christian? I am. How
[31:04] are you baptized in the name of the Lord
[31:06] Jesus Christ? How many gods do you
[31:09] worship? Amen. Do you believe in
[31:12] holiness? Do you pray? Do you read your
[31:16] Bible? Come on, somebody. Don't sit
[31:18] there and look at me like that. Or do
[31:20] you ask them what's their favorite
[31:22] movie? What's their favorite book to
[31:25] read? And you're looking for a Holy
[31:27] Ghost fililled wife.
[31:32] Woo! Pour it in, Lord. If you're looking
[31:36] for a woman to raise your children
[31:39] that's a real daughter of God, don't be
[31:41] scared to ask her godly questions. Don't
[31:45] ask her things that's stupid. Don't ask
[31:48] her things that's of a worldly nature.
[31:51] Unless, of course, that's the kind of
[31:53] woman you're looking for. I say, "Shame
[31:56] on you sons of God." That would court
[31:59] such a woman. Shame on you sisters that
[32:02] would court a man that's a Baptist or a
[32:05] church of Christ or a church of God and
[32:08] that's the kind of man you want to be
[32:10] the head of your home. Shame on you. Oh,
[32:14] I tell you, brother Donnie, I am so
[32:16] desperate. Don't you measure that
[32:18] so-called desperation to a place that
[32:21] you'll lower your standard and wind up
[32:24] with a drunk or a wife beater. I'd
[32:27] rather live 30 years by myself and wait
[32:30] on a real son or daughter of God to be
[32:33] your true companion than wind up getting
[32:35] married at 18 or 20 and regret it the
[32:39] rest of your life.
[32:42] Well, go ahead and give the Lord a hand.
[32:46] Now you see this man after he had
[32:50] started delivering the message to me
[32:53] this proves the potential and the power
[32:57] of what he's already said. Now he's not
[33:00] even asked her father yet. He's not even
[33:03] asked the head of the home which Laban
[33:05] her brother is going to be the spokesman
[33:07] for the home. And he's not even asked
[33:10] them at all. He's not even met them. But
[33:14] right there, because of her godly
[33:17] answers, he already knows God's working
[33:21] it all out. So, he didn't have to pray
[33:24] about it for 6 months to find out if
[33:27] she's going to be the right one. As I
[33:29] told a young man several years ago that
[33:32] was dating a very worldly girl, a
[33:35] painted face, bobhaired, Jezebel looking
[33:38] thing, and I told him, I said, "Brother,
[33:40] do you realize what you are doing?" Oh,
[33:42] brother Donnie, I'm trying to lead her
[33:43] to the Lord and I'm trying to lead her
[33:45] to the message. And I said, do you
[33:47] realize what you're doing while you're
[33:49] trying to lead her there? You are
[33:52] forfeiting your testimony among the
[33:56] people of God where you go to church
[33:58] with. And I know the church you go to
[34:00] and your pastor and the people there and
[34:03] they're fine people. and you every time
[34:06] they see you is that type of a woman and
[34:09] you're plastered all over social media
[34:12] with her dressed like I don't know what
[34:15] and you are allowing her to mar your
[34:18] testimony. So say you go 6 months or a
[34:21] year or a year and a half and then you
[34:23] finally tell her you believe God sent a
[34:26] prophet. You yell belly coward and
[34:29] chicken.
[34:31] Well, praise the Lord. I wonder if you
[34:34] really understand the force of this
[34:36] message. Eleaser never waited for 6
[34:39] months down the road. He laid it on her
[34:42] at the initial stage. Oh, you say,
[34:45] "Brother Donnie, what will it do?" Well,
[34:47] I'll tell you one thing. I'm afraid
[34:49] we're such pansies and we're such
[34:51] chickens and cowards that we've raised
[34:54] up a bunch of bastards inside the
[34:56] message of the hour. They can't take the
[34:59] word. They can't take hard preaching.
[35:01] and in 5 years, 10 years, they show
[35:04] theirel what they are. If they're
[35:06] ordained of God, you can't run them off.
[35:09] You cannot preach it too hard for them.
[35:12] You preach a hard service and they'll be
[35:14] right back every night. But we're trying
[35:17] to win people. Yeah, we're winning them.
[35:19] All right. And we quit preaching the
[35:21] message. Do you understand? Some message
[35:23] preachers don't even want you to read
[35:25] quotes no more. There was a message
[35:28] preacher that told some friends of mine
[35:29] not long ago. Don't mention Brother
[35:31] Brandham's name now and don't read no
[35:34] quotes because I'm trying to win people
[35:36] to the message. So you win them to the
[35:39] message by silencing the word of God for
[35:42] the hour. Poor blind leaders. You see
[35:45] what Satan's doing? He'll have somebody
[35:48] there new every service if you'll shut
[35:51] up on the message of the hour. We've had
[35:53] a lot of folks come new. And you know
[35:55] what? I ain't going to give them a year
[35:57] and a half or 3 years or four years to
[36:00] understand what we believe. I'm trying
[36:02] to preach you into a body change. Do you
[36:06] want me to compromise? Do you want me to
[36:09] water it down because we get a visitor
[36:12] here and a visitor there? Or do you want
[36:15] me to pray preach bride style? Do you
[36:18] want me to preach rapturing style? Do
[36:21] you want me to preach maturity style?
[36:32] Hallelujah.
[36:34] So Alie Ezer gives Rebecca
[36:39] this part of the message
[36:43] and she starts responding immediately.
[36:49] Now I want you to notice his response to
[36:52] her response.
[36:54] He bows his head and he worships the
[36:58] Lord. Now he don't worship Abraham and
[37:00] he don't worship Isaac and he don't
[37:03] worship Rebecca but he worships the Lord
[37:07] Jehovah Adoni. Now remember a gentile
[37:12] but after the message started being
[37:16] delivered then he started worshiping. I
[37:21] find this so consequential to the
[37:24] message of the hour that we as the
[37:27] people of God are not just recipient and
[37:30] receivers of truth but after we have
[37:34] receive the truth then we should start
[37:37] worshiping like never before. Now when I
[37:40] mention worshiping I don't mean that
[37:43] we're you know that we're we're we're so
[37:45] loud and and that we never hear the
[37:47] preacher. No I ain't talking about that.
[37:48] I ain't talking about running up down
[37:49] the house. You you want to run them down
[37:51] the house, go right ahead and you want
[37:52] to praise God. Praise God. But I want
[37:55] you to notice it's after we get
[37:58] something then it sparks this fire of
[38:02] worship. Now the Bible doesn't say
[38:04] nothing about him worshiping whenever he
[38:06] asked her the question. It did not say
[38:09] anything about him worshiping as soon as
[38:11] he saw her at the well. Now he was
[38:13] praying. You understand? He was praying.
[38:16] Now Lord God, please help me. You know
[38:17] the prophet said the angel of God beat
[38:19] him there about 30 minutes. So once he
[38:22] got there then he started setting forth
[38:24] the message and after the message was
[38:28] starting to be delivered then this man
[38:31] set in motion something we don't even
[38:33] know what her faith was. We don't know
[38:35] where she was. Remember she was out
[38:37] under the tutorship of Abraham and we
[38:39] know what Laban was. He was an idoltor.
[38:42] But there was seed laying down inside of
[38:45] Rebecca. Even though she might not have
[38:47] been taught, but what was this messenger
[38:50] doing? As she responded to the word and
[38:54] he saw that response, then he started
[38:58] worshiping. Who knows? She may have
[39:00] never seen it done that way before. Now,
[39:04] let's see if this parallels with the
[39:06] message in the last day. Now, watch
[39:09] this. The mighty conqueror, peace,
[39:11] peace. Now, the prophet and the saints
[39:12] there, they are singing and the
[39:14] worshiping the Lord. He said, "Let's
[39:16] just raise up our hands to worship God."
[39:19] Wonderful peace are the words he's
[39:21] saying. Coming down from the father
[39:23] above, sweep over my spirit, I pray, and
[39:27] fathomless billows of love. Let's sing
[39:29] it quietly like this. Now, peace, just
[39:33] worship now. Wonderful peace coming down
[39:37] from the father above. Sweep over my
[39:40] spirit, I pray, in the fathomless billow
[39:42] of love. Brother Brandham Hums just
[39:45] bathed
[39:48] in his beauty.
[39:51] Bathed
[39:53] in his beauty. Wow. What a call from the
[39:59] messenger. Now notice how he relates in
[40:01] these things. I'm going to read to you.
[40:03] Wonderful piece coming down from the
[40:05] father above. Now what's he doing? He's
[40:08] creating after the message which is
[40:10] called the mighty conqueror in Edmonton.
[40:12] After he preached that, now he's
[40:14] encouraging the people to worship and
[40:18] actually then move into a place of
[40:22] bathing.
[40:24] Bathing
[40:25] in the beauty of the Lord. So I wonder
[40:30] if this don't tie in with the scripture
[40:32] that he will beautify the meek with
[40:36] salvation. You see why Satan wants us to
[40:40] get in such a big hurry after the words
[40:43] over. Then we've all got to rush out and
[40:45] we've got to go, you know, oh my, we got
[40:46] to do this and that and the other and
[40:47] Santa turn for 45 minutes or 30 minutes
[40:50] or whatever it is or go here there
[40:52] because we got to go get a hamburger and
[40:53] French fries and you miss your bathing
[40:56] in the beauty of the Lord. Notice again
[41:00] in Hebrews tabernacle of course just
[41:02] worship him in your soul. Now see
[41:05] getting quiet. The healing service is
[41:07] coming up. The message is over. Let's
[41:12] worship. The message is over. Let's
[41:15] worship again. He said now with our
[41:17] heads bowed quietly, slowly. Let's just
[41:20] sing this song out. This is worship. The
[41:25] message is over. No one leave.
[41:28] Right.
[41:31] Rroll. Amen. Come on. The message is
[41:36] over. No one leave. Just be quiet.
[41:42] Let's worship.
[41:44] Which lets me know a lot of folks don't
[41:47] know how to worship like this.
[41:50] Because unless we are jumping like
[41:53] Pentecost and screaming like Pentecost,
[41:58] people think we're not worshiping. Well,
[42:01] one or two things we're going to have to
[42:02] do. We're going to think you know more
[42:05] about worship than God's prophet. Or
[42:07] God's prophet know more about worship
[42:10] than you do
[42:12] and than I do. And I admit it right here
[42:15] tonight. He knows a lot more about
[42:18] worship, about God, about water baptism,
[42:20] about just about everything as far as I
[42:22] know right now than I ever will know and
[42:24] before I ever did know. But the truth of
[42:27] it is, can we submit to the teaching of
[42:30] the Ezra that was sent to us
[42:34] or do we want to instruct him?
[42:37] Now watch Elijah and the meal offering.
[42:40] all at your message. Just don't you feel
[42:43] all scoured out. Just the Holy Spirit
[42:47] cleaning your heart from all unbelief,
[42:50] putting you right back in track with God
[42:52] again. Oh, now the now the is the time
[42:55] to worship him. The message is over. So,
[42:58] let's just worship.
[43:01] So, I went into Kroger today
[43:04] and when I told Carol I was looking for
[43:06] a certain drink that I like, a pineapple
[43:08] drink that's only seasonal. And I went
[43:09] in there to get it and there was a
[43:11] little bitty old girl probably about
[43:13] that tall. And I met her coming in the
[43:16] aisle and she had a little box in in her
[43:19] hands. I couldn't tell what it was.
[43:21] crackers, cookies, I don't know what it
[43:23] was, but she had that little box and she
[43:25] had both hands around it like this and
[43:28] she held it right up to her little chest
[43:31] and she was walking down the aisle with
[43:34] her eyes closed like this and saying,
[43:36] "I'm so glad I found you."
[43:41] I about had a spell
[43:44] cuz I thought, "Oh, Jesus."
[43:47] And I I didn't tell him, "I'm so glad I
[43:50] found you." But you know what I told
[43:52] him, don't you? I'm so glad you found
[43:55] me.
[43:57] Oh, hallelujah. To me, I know that's
[43:59] weird, but I just look for God for for
[44:02] things that God can speak to me. And I
[44:04] could just see me. I could just see me
[44:08] being pulled up to the very chest of God
[44:12] and God saying about me and about you,
[44:16] I'm so glad I found you. I'm so glad I
[44:20] got you. And I thought, bless her heart.
[44:23] I believe the Lord worked it out where I
[44:24] could just see that little old. It was
[44:26] just absolutely a phenomenal moment
[44:29] because she had them little eyes closed
[44:31] and she just had that look on her face.
[44:33] I don't know what it was. It might have
[44:35] been broccoli chips. It might have been
[44:37] reffried broccoli. It might have been
[44:39] kale. I don't have a clue. But you know
[44:41] what? She would didn't ask me what I
[44:43] thought about it. Oh, she knows what
[44:45] she's so happy. I am so happy tonight
[44:49] that I'm in the message of the last day.
[44:52] I'm so happy I'm identified with people
[44:55] that still believe the full gospel of
[44:58] Jesus Christ. I'm so happy we go to a
[45:02] church that sees the power of the living
[45:05] God. I'm so glad. I'm so glad.
[45:14] Hallelujah.
[45:16] Watch him again. I love him. Now, let's
[45:20] worship. We've had a cutting message.
[45:24] Let's worship.
[45:26] Isn't it strange though that he would
[45:29] identify after a cutting, scouring hard
[45:32] sermon to worship
[45:36] cuz most people's pouting or mad or, you
[45:40] know, they're upset or whatever whatever
[45:42] they're they're processed and they're,
[45:44] you know, everybody don't go that way.
[45:46] Of course, a lot of them are thankful
[45:47] and they're grateful to God and they
[45:49] say, "Okay, yeah, I've got to measure up
[45:51] and they leave outbururdened." That's
[45:52] not even the right way to do it either.
[45:55] Even until you hear yourself being
[45:57] corrected and you say, "Lord, I'm so
[45:58] wrong." What you want to do is put
[46:01] worship right on top of that correction.
[46:03] Just pull that w that worship. Say,
[46:06] "Thank you, Lord, for telling me the
[46:07] truth. I'm not leaving you tonight
[46:09] defeated." Boy, he read my life. I'm
[46:11] telling you, but I thank God for it. I
[46:13] thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[46:18] I want you to listen to this. A brother
[46:19] here in the church sent this to me this
[46:21] week. A groundbreaking 2016 study by Dr.
[46:25] Michael Ferguson using MRI scans
[46:28] revealed that worship
[46:30] activates
[46:32] a unique combination of brain systems
[46:36] unlike any other experience.
[46:40] While emotions like love, music or
[46:44] beauty each stimulates specific areas of
[46:48] the brain, worship stands apart by
[46:52] lighting up multiple networks
[46:57] simultaneously.
[46:59] So they done MRI scans on people that
[47:02] was worshiping God. And I saw these
[47:05] scans whenever I did research on this to
[47:08] pull it up. And it was amazing that here
[47:11] was these parts of the brain in the MRI
[47:15] and they were lit up almost like a
[47:17] reddish orange and all they were doing
[47:20] they wasn't high. They wasn't drinking
[47:23] but they was just simply worshiping the
[47:26] Lord. And it did something, hallelujah,
[47:30] inside of their brain.
[47:34] Amen. I'll tell you one thing, just for
[47:36] health purposes, you ought to want to
[47:37] praise him more.
[47:39] [Laughter]
[47:41] [Music]
[47:43] Oh, glory. Notice the c the scan showed
[47:46] that worship engages the three systems
[47:50] at once. the reward system, moral
[47:56] reasoning centers, focused attention
[48:01] network. Oh my, that's why people
[48:04] describe it as being in a different
[48:07] category entirely because it is the
[48:12] brain responds to worship like it was
[48:17] made for it.
[48:19] The brain responds to worship like it
[48:23] was made for. This is why the prophet
[48:26] said, "You was not made to worry. You
[48:29] were not made to be sad." I know we've
[48:33] got so many things we're going through
[48:35] in life, but does the sadness help it?
[48:38] Does worry make it any better? But what
[48:41] can worship do? worship can go and
[48:45] illuminate the reward system in your
[48:48] brain, which are the endorphins, and
[48:50] release the things inside of your body.
[48:53] It ain't no wonder the devil don't want
[48:56] us to worship God or just get in a
[48:59] formal thing. Well, hallelujah.
[49:01] Hallelujah. No, don't do that. But God
[49:04] wants to do it with all of our heart,
[49:07] our soul, our might, our strength.
[49:17] Notice this on the voice of the sign.
[49:19] Everybody's saying in the spirit now a
[49:23] real cutting message.
[49:26] Let's worship him in his presence.
[49:31] Let's worship him in his presence. I
[49:35] want you to notice that anybody did did
[49:37] it stick out to anybody in any of these
[49:40] quotes that he never mentioned one thing
[49:42] about feeling.
[49:45] Never mentioned one thing about if you
[49:47] feel it, worship him. If you don't feel
[49:48] it, don't. Anybody notice he never said
[49:50] nothing like that. He just said worship,
[49:54] worship. But I don't m I don't feel it.
[49:56] Don't matter. Supposed to worship him
[49:58] anyhow. Lift up holy hands or that wrath
[50:01] and doubting him. Now, why? It does
[50:03] something after the message is preached.
[50:07] It's not just a joyous type of message
[50:08] that makes us all rejoice. Anybody can
[50:11] do that. But sometimes when it's hard
[50:13] and cutting and yet we're able to sit
[50:16] there and say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus,
[50:19] for your word. You love me so much. It
[50:22] proves I'm one of yours because you knew
[50:24] I was wrong and you anointed a servant
[50:27] of God to tell me the truth about it."
[50:30] Now watch. Let's let's shift it now. I
[50:33] didn't get quite done with that last
[50:34] Wednesday night. The the moar
[50:39] is the price that is paid for the bride
[50:44] or call the bride price. It's considered
[50:48] from the the husband, the bridegroom and
[50:51] his family as I mentioned to you last
[50:53] week and week before I as well that they
[50:55] are getting a great asset and the
[50:58] bride's family is losing one. Now, let
[51:02] me just tell you right now, there ain't
[51:05] a quality of people nowhere that you'll
[51:07] ever find quite like the bride. As a
[51:10] matter of fact, I know that a lot of
[51:12] these folks out here in the world, they
[51:14] make fun of us denominational people and
[51:15] so on. They ridicule us. All these
[51:17] believe the sign people that's left the
[51:19] message and all that sort of thing. They
[51:20] hate us. But in reality, they would love
[51:23] to have Daryl Ward on their side. They
[51:26] would love to have Tim Puit. My
[51:28] goodness, that little blackheaded
[51:30] blackeyed man, I'm telling you what, if
[51:32] you imagine if he was on the believe the
[51:34] sign side, can you imagine some of these
[51:37] other brothers if they was on that side?
[51:39] You imagine what they would do if they
[51:42] would switch and go over to them. Oh,
[51:44] they love it so much. Why? Because
[51:46] there's something about us, but that's
[51:49] why we're on the side we're on. You see,
[51:52] that's the very reason. Can you imagine
[51:54] if the devil could have had Joshua on
[51:57] his side? Can you imagine if he'd been
[51:59] able to have Caleb on his side, but his
[52:02] side wasn't good enough for Caleb? Come
[52:05] on, somebody. I'll tell you one thing.
[52:07] There is nobody like the bride of Christ
[52:10] around the world. They have a
[52:12] determination. They've got a strength.
[52:15] They've got a revelation. They've got
[52:17] something the devil's children can't
[52:19] even dream about having. And the truth
[52:22] of it is the devil, if you hear him say
[52:24] it, I wish he was mine. I wish she was
[52:27] mine. I wish he was mine. Sorry, devil.
[52:31] We belong to another. We have already
[52:34] been bought and prayed for, paid for. We
[52:37] are not for sale.
[52:45] Now notice the father of the groom's
[52:48] integrity
[52:50] and stature
[52:53] was at stake considering the bride
[52:56] price. It made no difference how poor
[53:01] the bride's family were.
[53:04] They did not give this price to their
[53:07] family because their family were what's
[53:10] it like this so you can relate. Well,
[53:11] the bridegroom's family was millionaires
[53:13] and the bride's family was millionaires.
[53:15] So, they all kind of you know chummed
[53:17] around all hung out at the same places
[53:19] and all that sort of thing. So, they
[53:20] felt it obligatory to be able to give
[53:23] them a millionaire's purse. No. If the
[53:26] bride was as poor as Job's turkey, as
[53:28] brother Bram said, it had nothing to do
[53:33] with her family
[53:35] and where she come from. It all had to
[53:38] do with the father of the bridegroom.
[53:43] So he would pay an extravagant amount.
[53:49] You imagine a poor poor girl that felt
[53:53] like she'd never find anybody that would
[53:55] ever love her and ever be able to care
[53:58] for her. Many of you remember years ago
[53:59] when brother told that story about the
[54:01] 10 cow bride and how it changed that
[54:04] bride, the way she walked and the way
[54:06] she talked and the way she acted. Don't
[54:08] you understand why? It was based upon
[54:11] the character, the wealth and
[54:37] and he wants to pay an extravagant
[54:42] price not to reflect you.
[54:46] Not because you're worth it in the
[54:48] initial buying stages. Don't you
[54:51] understand? We shame him. We shame him
[54:55] when we act like that that oh I'm not
[54:59] worthy. I'm not I'm not good enough. I'm
[55:00] not good enough. Well, of course you're
[55:01] not. He knew that too. But if he paid
[55:04] that price, don't shame him anymore. Oh,
[55:07] like that 10 cow bride.
[55:10] Life fitting as the queen of heaven.
[55:14] So notice then it was the father of the
[55:18] bridegroom. So it would be considering
[55:21] his stature and his wealth. It would be
[55:25] a fitting price for the bride based upon
[55:30] what the father was worth. 1 Corinthians
[55:34] chapter 6 19. What know ye not that your
[55:37] body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which
[55:39] is in you which ye have of God and ye
[55:43] are not your own? Are ye a Oh my ye are
[55:47] bought with a price. Therefore, glorify
[55:51] God in your body, in your spirit, which
[55:56] are gods. Amen. 1 Peter 1:18, "For as
[56:01] much as that ye were not redeemed with
[56:04] corruptible things, as silver and gold,
[56:07] both from your vain conversation
[56:09] received by tradition from your fathers,
[56:13] but with the precious
[56:16] blood of Christ." And the Greek word
[56:19] precious has a twofold meaning. costly
[56:22] in the sense of value and highly
[56:25] esteemed or held in high honor. So the
[56:29] blood of Christ is costly essentially
[56:33] and inherently
[56:35] precious because it's God's blood. Acts
[56:40] 20 28 if you'd like to write it down.
[56:43] We're redeemed by the blood of God.
[56:48] The universe had nothing more valuable
[56:53] than the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[56:57] Gold, silver, oh my, all the precious
[57:00] gems of the earth couldn't even compare.
[57:04] 1 Peter 1:20, who verily was fore
[57:07] orained before the foundation of the
[57:09] world, but was manifest in these last
[57:12] times for you, having been bought with
[57:16] such a price.
[57:18] Then what does that do? That reflects
[57:20] upon the bride in the way that she looks
[57:23] at his grace. What helps you to see that
[57:25] the majority of Christendom in the day
[57:28] we live does not have an idea, a concept
[57:32] of this at all. They think because the
[57:34] blood is there, they can do whatever
[57:36] they want to do, live any way they want
[57:37] to live. And it's a shame a lot of the
[57:39] message folks are getting the same way.
[57:41] They're getting cold and indifferent
[57:42] with God and the world creeping back in
[57:44] their lives, creeping back in their home
[57:46] and said, "Well, I'm the bride of
[57:47] Christ." If you're the bride of Christ,
[57:49] act like it. Act like that you are one
[57:52] that is worthy recipient of the blood of
[57:55] the Lord Jesus.
[57:58] Oh my our mahar.
[58:02] The bride price was the life
[58:07] of the Lord Jesus.
[58:10] And this price was required
[58:13] by law.
[58:15] Romans 8:3. For what the law could not
[58:17] do in that it was weak through the
[58:20] flesh. God sending his own son in the
[58:24] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[58:29] condemns sin
[58:32] where not in heaven but in the flesh
[58:37] that the righteousness of the law might
[58:40] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[58:44] the flesh but after the spirit.
[58:48] Now then along with Eleazar's camel
[58:52] train
[58:53] he has an assortment of gifts
[58:57] those gifts will overlap.
[59:01] So there are gifts that is the bride
[59:04] price which will go to the mother the
[59:07] father if the father's not gone it'll be
[59:09] an elder brother and then there's also
[59:12] the matan
[59:15] matan it was called. And these are the
[59:19] love gifts. M- a tan.
[59:22] These are the love gifts not required
[59:26] but most of the time given
[59:30] from the bridegroom. Now remember the
[59:33] mohar was from the bridegroom's father.
[59:37] The matan
[59:39] is from the bridegroom himself.
[59:42] So the father paid the price for God so
[59:46] loved the world. We know one of the most
[59:48] famous scriptures in the New Testament.
[59:50] So believers are given gifts from our
[59:55] bridegroom himself. Can we look at a few
[59:58] of them tonight? Forgiveness of sins.
[1:00:02] Acts 13:38.
[1:00:04] Be it known unto you, therefore, men and
[1:00:07] brethren, that through this man is
[1:00:09] preached unto you the forgiveness of
[1:00:12] sins. And the bride said, "Amen."
[1:00:16] Ephesians 1:7, "In whom we have
[1:00:19] redemption through his blood, the
[1:00:22] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:00:26] riches of his grace." Colossians 1:14,
[1:00:31] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:00:34] blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
[1:00:38] Another one of the things that he
[1:00:40] imparted into his bride. Now, this is a
[1:00:42] personal impartation from the groom
[1:00:44] himself, eternal life. St. John 10:27,
[1:00:48] "My sheep hear my voice, and I know
[1:00:51] them, and they follow me, and I give
[1:00:54] unto them eternal life, and they shall
[1:00:57] never perish, neither shall any man
[1:00:59] pluck them out of my hand." Now, this is
[1:01:02] a matan. This is specifically from the
[1:01:06] bridegroom to the bride. Another one is
[1:01:10] acceptance. Ephesians 1:5, "Having
[1:01:13] predestinated us, uh oh, the early
[1:01:16] church believed in predestination,
[1:01:18] so does our church."
[1:01:21] Now, for those people who are leaving
[1:01:22] the message, this is what we as message
[1:01:25] people believe. We believe the Bible.
[1:01:28] So, when you're leaving the message,
[1:01:29] you're leaving a big portion of the
[1:01:31] Bible behind you.
[1:01:34] And the Word of Life Church said,
[1:01:35] "Amen." I'd really weigh my odds when
[1:01:38] you're talking about leaving the
[1:01:39] message. Because in the message, we
[1:01:41] believe you're saved by the blood of the
[1:01:42] Lord Jesus through the grace of God. We
[1:01:45] believe there's a heaven. We believe
[1:01:46] there's a hell. We believe that there's
[1:01:48] one God. We believe in water baptism in
[1:01:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[1:01:53] believe he founded the church. He made
[1:01:55] the church. He's coming back for the
[1:01:56] church. We believe if you disobey him,
[1:01:59] you go to hell and you will be
[1:02:00] annihilated. Should I go on? That's what
[1:02:03] we believe as message people. So when
[1:02:05] people say they're leaving the message,
[1:02:07] that's quite a mouthful.
[1:02:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. Notice, oh, thank
[1:02:16] you, Jesus. To the praise of the glory
[1:02:19] of his grace when he has made us
[1:02:26] most of us have wanted our whole lives
[1:02:30] to be accepted.
[1:02:33] Except a lot of times it was by people
[1:02:35] that really didn't matter anyway.
[1:02:39] But we want to be accepted. Come on,
[1:02:41] young people. You know what that's like.
[1:02:43] Whenever some young people in our church
[1:02:45] will have their own little click and
[1:02:46] they won't let you in and you get your
[1:02:48] feelings hurt and you know it ain't just
[1:02:50] so with young people. It's so with old
[1:02:52] people. It's so with preachers.
[1:02:53] Preachers will have their little click
[1:02:55] and they won't let certain ones in. And
[1:02:57] if you cross them in that click, then
[1:02:59] they'll push you out and then they won't
[1:03:01] have nothing to do with you no more. And
[1:03:03] you know, it's kind of and it hurts us
[1:03:04] all. And we want to be accepted. Well,
[1:03:07] I'll tell you one thing. I've been
[1:03:09] kicked out of a lot of clicks of years
[1:03:11] in my life. I have no doubt I'll be
[1:03:13] kicked out of a whole lot more. But
[1:03:15] there's one thing I will never be kicked
[1:03:18] out of, and that is the acceptation of
[1:03:21] Almighty God. It seems to get together
[1:03:23] and said, "Brother Donny's losing his
[1:03:25] mind." That's what it is. And some of
[1:03:27] the preachers say he's he's crazy.
[1:03:29] There's something going on. He say, "We
[1:03:30] don't want him here no more." And you
[1:03:32] take my name off the sign out yonder and
[1:03:35] you vote somebody else in. But there's
[1:03:37] one thing about it. You might get rid of
[1:03:39] me here, but you won't be able to get
[1:03:41] rid of me over there. Cuz I am accepted
[1:03:44] in the beloved. Not because you think I
[1:03:47] am. Not because other people think I am,
[1:03:50] but because I have met God's
[1:03:53] requirement.
[1:03:54] Aren't you glad for that?
[1:03:57] Notice another thing now that's in our
[1:04:00] matan.
[1:04:01] Oh, and we all need this
[1:04:04] peace.
[1:04:05] Amen. St. John 14:27,
[1:04:09] "Peace I," Notice who's saying this,
[1:04:12] "The bridegroom, our husband. Peace I
[1:04:16] leave with you. My peace."
[1:04:20] How many needs more of it in this
[1:04:22] troubled hour? I'll tell you one thing.
[1:04:23] I sure do, saints.
[1:04:25] My peace I give unto you, not as the
[1:04:29] world giveth give unto you. Let not your
[1:04:31] heart be troubled, neither let it be
[1:04:34] afraid. Lord, help me. Lord, help me.
[1:04:38] Philippians 4:7, "And the peace of God
[1:04:41] which passes all understanding shall
[1:04:44] keep your hearts and minds." Through
[1:04:47] who? Your bridegroom. Not your
[1:04:49] faithfulness, not your attendance, not
[1:04:52] your tithe paying. He will do that
[1:04:54] through Jesus Christ. It's as simple as
[1:04:57] us being able to allow him to do it.
[1:05:00] It just overwhelms me that we would
[1:05:02] rather hold on to fear and we would
[1:05:05] rather hold on to anxiety and we would
[1:05:08] rather hold on to worry than to let it
[1:05:11] go and let peace overwhelm us. And then
[1:05:16] you can be like the little girl in the
[1:05:17] grocery store. I'm so glad I found you.
[1:05:19] I'm so glad I found you. I'll let my
[1:05:21] worry go. But you can't hold on to both
[1:05:23] of them. Now that little girl doesn't
[1:05:24] have room and her little arms, her
[1:05:26] little arms are so tiny and so small.
[1:05:27] She didn't have room enough for you know
[1:05:29] for a box of crackers and saltines and
[1:05:31] you know sugar-free gyro this and that
[1:05:33] and the other she didn't have enough
[1:05:35] room brother Jim and the more if we can
[1:05:37] just lighten up friends up oh lighten up
[1:05:40] all your worry and your anxiety and your
[1:05:42] fear and realize you just got a little
[1:05:44] bit of set arms and just pull it right
[1:05:46] Jesus thank you Lord I've got peace I've
[1:05:49] got joy there's hell all around me
[1:05:51] there's trouble there's anxiety there's
[1:05:53] all kinds of things around me Lord to
[1:05:55] make me worry but I'm feeling Pretty
[1:05:57] strange. I've been a warrior all my
[1:05:59] life, but I've got peace now. Lord,
[1:06:01] wouldn't it be awesome if there'd be
[1:06:02] some of the bride members get that
[1:06:04] before the rapture?
[1:06:07] So, what are we all going to do? Oh, I
[1:06:10] know. We're going to wait till the
[1:06:12] millennium
[1:06:14] and then in the millennium, we'll get
[1:06:16] all these promises and we'll walk out as
[1:06:19] the children of
[1:06:23] I want them now.
[1:06:25] Do you have my brother Donnie? I've got
[1:06:27] a little bit.
[1:06:30] I've got a little bit, but I want a lot
[1:06:32] more.
[1:06:34] Notice this joy. Oh my goodness. Joy,
[1:06:38] joy is not just a person. Joy is
[1:06:41] actually a thing, a great thing. St.
[1:06:44] John 17:13. Now I come to thee and these
[1:06:47] things I speak in the world that they
[1:06:49] may might have.
[1:06:53] A
[1:06:56] so you see the Lord Jesus is not saying
[1:07:00] your joy is going to be so great.
[1:07:03] He wants you
[1:07:05] to have his joy.
[1:07:09] So I trade his joy for my anxiety. Amen.
[1:07:14] I trade his joy from my worry. But
[1:07:17] brother Donnie, I got a bad doctor's
[1:07:19] report. I understand them reports. I
[1:07:21] understand what they can do to you. But
[1:07:23] either God's word is true or it's a lie.
[1:07:26] And if it's a lie, we might as well all
[1:07:28] just quit and go out to the world, eat,
[1:07:29] drink, and be married, die lost, and all
[1:07:31] go to hell. Or we believe God can give
[1:07:34] us joy in the midst of trouble.
[1:07:38] And the church said,
[1:07:40] Romans 5:11,
[1:07:42] not only so, but we also joy in God
[1:07:47] through Jesus Christ, our Lord Jesus
[1:07:50] Christ, by whom we have now received the
[1:07:54] atonement. Romans 14:17, for the kingdom
[1:07:57] of God is not meat and drink, but
[1:08:00] righteousness and peace and joy
[1:08:04] in the Holy Ghost. Amen. Romans 15:13.
[1:08:08] Now the God of hope
[1:08:11] fill you.
[1:08:13] Oh my goodness. With all joy and peace
[1:08:19] in believing
[1:08:21] that ye may abound in hope through the
[1:08:25] power of the Holy Ghost. But notice
[1:08:27] Galatians 5:22. But the fruit of the
[1:08:31] spirit is love, joy, peace,
[1:08:34] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[1:08:38] faith.
[1:08:40] Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:08:46] I want to share with you tonight
[1:08:50] one chapter
[1:08:52] from the book of Romans.
[1:08:57] If you will take this one chapter
[1:09:01] and dissect it verse by verse
[1:09:05] and look at what what I'll share with
[1:09:08] you here tonight,
[1:09:11] it will transform
[1:09:13] your life.
[1:09:17] And let me make a disclaimer right here.
[1:09:20] I am not responsible for my actions from
[1:09:25] this point on. Amen. And we ain't got no
[1:09:28] by around here for me to run off in, but
[1:09:30] we got a long aisle right there. So now
[1:09:33] look at what is ours as the followers
[1:09:36] and believers and bride of the Lord
[1:09:39] Jesus as what Paul describes in just
[1:09:44] this one chapter. Romans chapter 8. Now,
[1:09:48] let's take it verse by verse down
[1:09:50] through here. And may God help me to be
[1:09:53] able to bring it to you. Notice we are
[1:09:57] no longer under condemnation. Now, I put
[1:10:02] the promise up here and then I'm going
[1:10:04] to give you the verse. No longer under
[1:10:08] condemnation.
[1:10:09] There is therefore now no condemnation
[1:10:15] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:10:19] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:10:23] spirit.
[1:10:24] Amen. Amen. We are set free from the law
[1:10:30] of sin and death. Now I want you to
[1:10:32] notice now Paul wrote this. You talking
[1:10:35] about explosive like dynamite. If God
[1:10:39] can make this real to us tonight, we are
[1:10:42] set free from the law of sin and death.
[1:10:45] Romans 8:2. For the law of the spirit of
[1:10:48] life in Christ Jesus has made me free
[1:10:52] from the law of sin and death. Christ
[1:10:57] did something for us we could not do.
[1:11:02] Condemning sin in his flesh on our
[1:11:07] behalf. Not a man that was ever born
[1:11:10] could condemn sin. Oh, glory to God.
[1:11:14] There was not a mortal after Adam that
[1:11:17] could ever condemn sin in his own flesh.
[1:11:21] But the Lord Jesus was able to take sin
[1:11:24] in his own flesh. And not just from his
[1:11:27] soul, not just from his spirit, but in
[1:11:31] his sinless body. He condemns sin in the
[1:11:35] flesh.
[1:11:37] Amen.
[1:11:40] Notice in verse three, for what the law
[1:11:42] could not do in that it was weak through
[1:11:45] the flesh, God sending his own son in
[1:11:49] the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:11:53] condemns sin in the flesh.
[1:11:57] Hallelujah.
[1:11:59] Notice we can fulfill the law
[1:12:04] as we walk according to the spirit. And
[1:12:08] we never had that ability to do this
[1:12:11] before.
[1:12:16] Hallelujah. Romans 8:4. that the
[1:12:19] righteousness of the law
[1:12:23] might be fulfilled
[1:12:26] in us
[1:12:28] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:12:31] the spirit. We couldn't do this before.
[1:12:34] Can't you understand? This is why many
[1:12:35] Christians cannot do it now because
[1:12:38] they're not Holy Ghost fil Christians.
[1:12:41] They're saved people. But it takes the
[1:12:44] very life of God
[1:12:46] in your body to bring this body subject
[1:12:49] to the word. Friends, get it out of your
[1:12:51] mind. You're ever going to perfect your
[1:12:53] flesh. It will be a thorn for you from
[1:12:56] the day you get the Holy Ghost until the
[1:12:58] day you die. God don't want you
[1:12:59] perfecting the flesh. He wants you
[1:13:01] making the flesh obey the word. And
[1:13:04] sometimes the flesh will mess up, but
[1:13:06] the throne room inside of your soul will
[1:13:08] say, "Hey, hey, hey, fix that. Fix that.
[1:13:11] Make that right. Don't you let that go.
[1:13:16] Glory to God.
[1:13:18] Our minds are set
[1:13:22] and focused on the things of the spirit
[1:13:26] and we have the capacity to think
[1:13:30] in a new realm.
[1:13:34] Verse five, for they that are out of the
[1:13:37] flesh do mind the things of the flesh,
[1:13:48] but they that are act to the spirit
[1:13:51] the things of the spirit. We could not
[1:13:55] do this without him changing us.
[1:14:00] Hallelujah. All right. We have life and
[1:14:05] peace instead of death. For to be
[1:14:09] carnally minded is death, but to be
[1:14:12] spiritually minded is life and peace.
[1:14:18] Our mind is no longer hostile
[1:14:22] toward God.
[1:14:25] Remember, you were born an enemy against
[1:14:28] God.
[1:14:29] That's the way we were all born. I don't
[1:14:31] care if you was a preacher's son or a
[1:14:33] preacher's daughter. You were born and
[1:14:35] your mind was an enemy against God.
[1:14:40] But not any longer.
[1:14:43] Our mind is no longer hostile toward
[1:14:45] God. Verse seven, because a carnal mind
[1:14:47] is enmity against God. For it cannot, it
[1:14:50] is not subject to the law of God,
[1:14:52] neither indeed can be. Listen to this
[1:14:54] one. We can
[1:14:57] please
[1:14:59] God.
[1:15:03] Brother Daryl preached this Sunday up at
[1:15:05] brother Mike Wall's church
[1:15:07] about pleasing God. And he read about
[1:15:10] Enoch and before he left this world in a
[1:15:13] rapture. Of course, his testimony was he
[1:15:17] pleased God. Quite simple, but quite
[1:15:21] profound. Do you understand? You can,
[1:15:25] will, and must please God.
[1:15:30] So then they that are in the flesh
[1:15:33] cannot please God. But that ain't
[1:15:36] talking about us if we're born of the
[1:15:37] Holy Ghost.
[1:15:40] We belong to him. Verse nine, but ye are
[1:15:44] not in the flesh, but in the spirit. Now
[1:15:47] notice this is capital S. This is Holy
[1:15:49] Spirit, not your spirit. but in the
[1:15:52] spirit. If so be that the spirit of God
[1:15:55] dwell in you. Now if any man have not
[1:15:58] the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[1:16:00] I belong to the Lord Jesus. How do you
[1:16:03] know, brother Donnie? I got the baptism
[1:16:05] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:07] That's his claim ticket on me. I'm his.
[1:16:10] Our spirit is alive because of
[1:16:13] righteousness. Verse 10. If in Christ
[1:16:16] being you, the body is dead because of
[1:16:19] sin. But the spirit, capital S, is life
[1:16:23] because of righteousness. His spirit
[1:16:26] gives life to our mortal bodies. Boy,
[1:16:30] this used to be one of my favorite
[1:16:32] verses when I was a Pentecostal
[1:16:33] preacher. I don't even what I was even
[1:16:35] quoting. I didn't what I was even
[1:16:36] talking about. I'd quote it and run,
[1:16:38] scream, and holler and preach and people
[1:16:40] would shout around and this and that and
[1:16:42] the other. Didn't even have a clue what
[1:16:43] it really meant. But if the spirit of
[1:16:45] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:16:48] dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
[1:16:51] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:16:54] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:16:57] dwelleth in you.
[1:17:00] We are under obligation to live by the
[1:17:04] spirit, not according to the flesh. It
[1:17:07] can be fulfilled because his spirit is
[1:17:10] in us. You say, "I can't do it. I can't
[1:17:12] do it. I can't do this. I came to that
[1:17:14] if you've got the Holy Ghost, you will
[1:17:16] obey every word God says about you. That
[1:17:19] don't mean you'll do it the very next
[1:17:21] day after you get the Holy Ghost, you
[1:17:23] will grow into obedience as you grow
[1:17:26] into understanding. And this is the
[1:17:28] thing that people don't understand about
[1:17:29] the Holy Ghost. They think as soon as
[1:17:31] they get it, they're a full grown son.
[1:17:32] Well, my goodness, you didn't grow come
[1:17:34] out of your mama that way, did you?
[1:17:35] You'll grow in the Holy Ghost. You'll
[1:17:37] grow in submission. You'll grow in
[1:17:39] obedience. You'll grow in understanding.
[1:17:41] And the spirit of God knows that. And
[1:17:43] some of you are requiring mature stage
[1:17:45] of the Holy Ghost when you're not even
[1:17:47] up to that level yet. But don't tell God
[1:17:50] that he's not done something inside of
[1:17:53] you when he's bought your soul and
[1:17:55] placed that deposit of the baptism of
[1:17:58] the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:01] Oh my.
[1:18:04] Therefore, brethren, verse 12, we are
[1:18:06] debtors
[1:18:08] not to the flesh to live after the
[1:18:11] flesh. I love these little two words
[1:18:14] right here. We live.
[1:18:18] Verse 13. For if you live after the
[1:18:20] flesh, you shall die. But if you through
[1:18:22] the spirit do mortify the deeds of the
[1:18:25] body, why in the world are you having to
[1:18:28] mortify the deeds? If you've got the
[1:18:30] Holy Ghost, didn't your flesh get the
[1:18:32] Holy Ghost, too? No, it did not.
[1:18:37] You mean you've got to crucify? Sure.
[1:18:40] Your body ain't no more saved tonight
[1:18:42] than it was when you was a drunk out
[1:18:44] there in the world. A liar, a thief, a
[1:18:47] hormone, whatever your was. When are you
[1:18:48] ever going to get it saved? Your body
[1:18:51] does not have the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:55] That's true.
[1:19:01] For if you live after the flesh, you
[1:19:03] shall die. But if ye through the spirit
[1:19:06] do mortify, capture, make dead, punish
[1:19:11] the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
[1:19:16] I want you to listen to all these things
[1:19:18] that Christ Jesus the Matan has given to
[1:19:21] his bride.
[1:19:25] We are led by the spirit.
[1:19:29] Romans 8:14.
[1:19:35] For as many
[1:19:37] as are led by the spirit of God,
[1:19:42] they might possibly wind up being one of
[1:19:46] these days. Hopefully,
[1:19:50] as many as are led by the spirit of God,
[1:19:53] they are
[1:19:56] the sons of God.
[1:20:00] We have not received
[1:20:03] a spirit of slavery
[1:20:07] leading to fear. Verse 15. For you have
[1:20:11] not received the spirit of bondage
[1:20:15] again
[1:20:17] to fear.
[1:20:20] We were slaves to sin. You know what's
[1:20:23] absolutely horrible? We've still got
[1:20:25] many Christians that are still slaves.
[1:20:28] Many of them are not slaves to drinking
[1:20:29] anymore. They're not slaves to many
[1:20:31] things like that anymore. But it's more
[1:20:34] religious slavery. They never have any
[1:20:37] joy because they've got this goal set in
[1:20:40] their mind of what they think they're
[1:20:41] supposed to be, what they think a Holy
[1:20:43] Ghost person will be. You know, the
[1:20:45] bride's going to be this. And boy, the
[1:20:46] bride, I'll tell you one thing, man, the
[1:20:48] bride ain't going to have no battles.
[1:20:49] You need to read the book of Acts.
[1:20:51] You need to read the book of Galatians,
[1:20:53] Ephesians, Philippians, to Lemon, 1 and
[1:20:55] 2 Corinthians. Be sure and read them
[1:20:57] really. And 1 and 2 Thessalonians and
[1:20:59] Titus and all them and realize they had
[1:21:02] vitals just like you and I. I told Carol
[1:21:05] the other day, you know, the Lord Jesus
[1:21:07] must have really got disappointed with
[1:21:08] them disciples. But whenever he was
[1:21:10] still here and James and John come to
[1:21:12] him and said, 'Lord, I'll tell you what,
[1:21:13] me and my brother here, we'd like to sat
[1:21:15] on your right and your left hand. Would
[1:21:16] that be okay with you? Because that's
[1:21:17] what we want. And then there's debating
[1:21:19] along the way. And Jesus said, "What was
[1:21:21] y'all discussing? What was y'all talking
[1:21:22] about? Nobody would answer." So one of
[1:21:24] them finally said, "Well, we kind of
[1:21:25] want to know who's going to be the
[1:21:26] greatest among the kingdom." Jesus went
[1:21:28] over and got a child and said, "Well,
[1:21:30] except you become as humble and be
[1:21:31] converted as this little child. You
[1:21:33] won't even inherit the kingdom of God."
[1:21:34] You imagine how discouraged he must have
[1:21:36] got with them as a man. And the devil
[1:21:39] probably busted good every day laughing
[1:21:41] said, "And these are going to carry on
[1:21:44] his work." Wow. Wow. Wow. But it won't
[1:21:46] last very long because all we got to do
[1:21:48] is get one a little jealous against the
[1:21:49] other. And boy, I'll tell you one thing.
[1:21:51] They're going to fuss and fight. You get
[1:21:52] preachers fussing and fighting and get
[1:21:54] them acting like a bunch of babies. How
[1:21:56] in the world can the church go on? Well,
[1:21:57] praise the Lord, saints. But you know
[1:21:59] what? Jesus knew he had a new birth
[1:22:02] lined up for Peter. And he had a new
[1:22:04] birth lined up for James and John. And
[1:22:06] James and John never mention the right
[1:22:08] hand and the left hand no more.
[1:22:13] We have not received
[1:22:16] a spirit of slavery
[1:22:20] leading to fear.
[1:22:23] For ye have not received the spirit of
[1:22:25] bondage again to fear, but ye have
[1:22:27] received the spirit
[1:22:30] of adoption.
[1:22:32] So we didn't get the spirit of slavery
[1:22:35] leading to fear. But also we have
[1:22:38] received a spirit of adoption as sons by
[1:22:41] which we cry out aba father. Aba father.
[1:22:47] Praise God. The spirit himself testifies
[1:22:51] with our spirit
[1:22:54] that we are children of God. Verse 16,
[1:22:57] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:22:59] our spirit.
[1:23:02] You want to know if you got the Holy
[1:23:03] Ghost or not? What does your spirit say
[1:23:06] about the word? Right.
[1:23:10] The Holy Ghost not only bears witness
[1:23:13] with the written word of God and the
[1:23:14] message of the hour, but if you have the
[1:23:17] Holy Ghost within you, the Holy Ghost
[1:23:20] bears witness with you.
[1:23:25] How many believes in one God?
[1:23:29] You believe in been baptized in the name
[1:23:31] of Frank, Fred, Bill, Bob, Donnie, Jim,
[1:23:36] Mary, Elizabeth,
[1:23:40] how y'all believe in being baptized,
[1:23:43] Lord Jesus Christ. How many gods y'all
[1:23:45] worship?
[1:23:46] Y'all pray, read your Bible, come to
[1:23:50] church, pay your tithes, love your
[1:23:53] enemies. Wasn't as many yeses on that
[1:23:55] part.
[1:23:58] I mean, it's adding to your faith virtue
[1:24:01] and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:24:04] temperance.
[1:24:08] Well, somebody please tell me that. How
[1:24:10] can you all do all of that if you're
[1:24:13] doing it from your soul without him
[1:24:16] being in you?
[1:24:22] So, you mean you think you are that good
[1:24:24] of a person?
[1:24:26] You honestly think you are that great
[1:24:29] that you could do all of that on your
[1:24:31] own?
[1:24:35] No way, Jose. You heard that, didn't
[1:24:37] you? If there's any Jose in here,
[1:24:42] notice,
[1:24:43] because we are children, we are hes
[1:24:52] and if children then hes of God, joint
[1:24:55] hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer
[1:24:57] with him that we may also be glorified
[1:25:00] together.
[1:25:02] And I love this part. And the sufferings
[1:25:05] of this present time cannot compare to
[1:25:09] the glory that will be revealed in us.
[1:25:13] I want you to listen all that's in this
[1:25:16] one chapter. For I reckon the sufferings
[1:25:19] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:25:21] be compared with the glory which shall
[1:25:23] be revealed in us. Let me close here
[1:25:25] momentarily. Let me close with this. And
[1:25:27] it's a good place to stop. Our bodies
[1:25:32] will soon be completely
[1:25:35] redeemed.
[1:25:39] Romans 8:23.
[1:25:41] Not only they, but ourselves also, which
[1:25:45] have the first fruits of the spirit,
[1:25:49] even we
[1:25:51] ourselves
[1:25:53] grown
[1:25:55] within ourselves,
[1:25:57] grown within ourselves,
[1:26:01] waiting for the adoption
[1:26:04] to wit
[1:26:07] the redemption
[1:26:09] of the body.
[1:26:11] So here is not just a man with the Holy
[1:26:14] Ghost, a preacher with the Holy Ghost,
[1:26:16] but a church age messenger relating not
[1:26:20] just a good passage of scripture, but
[1:26:22] something that bore witness in his own
[1:26:25] life.
[1:26:27] He had the Holy Ghost, but he was
[1:26:29] groaning. Why? He wasn't satisfied.
[1:26:35] Wasn't that he was a sinner. Wasn't that
[1:26:37] he needed to be saved. It wasn't that he
[1:26:40] needed the Holy Ghost. He's waiting to
[1:26:43] get a body that'll match his soul.
[1:26:48] Let's stand together.
[1:26:52] Praise be to God.
[1:26:57] I trust everybody will read Romans
[1:26:59] chapter 8 in a little bit different
[1:27:00] light after tonight. Yes. If you need to
[1:27:03] go back and go through this again and
[1:27:05] again and again, I'd say it'd be quite
[1:27:07] amazing if you'd look at this this
[1:27:09] chapter right here for about four or
[1:27:10] five days. Let me know the results
[1:27:12] afterwards. Okay? And you compare all
[1:27:15] these things to what you are and what
[1:27:17] God has done for you. And you're looking
[1:27:18] around think, well, God ain't done
[1:27:20] nothing for me. This ought to turn every
[1:27:21] one of us upside down and inside out.
[1:27:24] And we just got down to part of it.
[1:27:26] Didn't get it all done. of all the
[1:27:28] things he has done and you're looking
[1:27:29] for something. Why? I need something to
[1:27:31] worship him about. I gave you quite a
[1:27:33] bit tonight. This should last you till
[1:27:34] at least Sunday.
[1:27:38] I'm talking about the 14th month in the
[1:27:40] millennium, Sunday.
[1:27:43] Don't you love him?
[1:27:45] Oh, praise the Lord. Now the message is
[1:27:49] over. What do you reckon Elijah would
[1:27:51] tell us to do?
[1:27:56] Huh? worship. Time to worship.
[1:28:01] Time to worship.
[1:28:05] So, I hope
[1:28:08] we seen some of our shortcomings. Did
[1:28:11] anybody besides me?
[1:28:13] Few of you. Okay. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:28:15] Wasn't in vain then. That's good.
[1:28:17] Anybody see where you could move up
[1:28:19] some? Praise the Lord. That's good. All
[1:28:21] right.
[1:28:24] Well, let's thank him for that.
[1:28:26] And let's worship him
[1:28:29] of his love that he's given to us.
[1:28:33] And you know what Ephesians 4 was given
[1:28:36] for? Apostles, prophets, evangelists,
[1:28:39] pastors, teachers, for the perfecting.
[1:28:41] Now that word is not sinlessness,
[1:28:44] but it is fully equipping the believers.
[1:28:49] That's what God called preachers are
[1:28:51] for, to equip you. It's not them telling
[1:28:55] I me and mine and I done this and I done
[1:28:58] that and talking about them and all
[1:28:59] that. That don't equip me with nothing
[1:29:01] but anger.
[1:29:04] I don't like hearing a preacher brag on
[1:29:05] himself all the time. Do you? No. It
[1:29:07] ain't never giving me no victory. Equip
[1:29:10] me, men of God.
[1:29:12] Let me say this to every preacher in our
[1:29:14] church. Don't get up here and waste the
[1:29:16] time of my people.
[1:29:19] Equip them.
[1:29:21] Give them something to fight with.
[1:29:24] They're going through hell every day in
[1:29:27] this life.
[1:29:29] I've told young preachers before,
[1:29:32] when you step behind the pullpit,
[1:29:35] if you will walk up there with this in
[1:29:37] your mind,
[1:29:39] then people will let you learn how to
[1:29:42] preach on them.
[1:29:45] They will put up with your immature
[1:29:48] things.
[1:29:51] They will let you learn how to preach
[1:29:53] because a preacher can't learn at
[1:29:54] school. They tried it. It don't work.
[1:29:57] So, you know where a preacher learns?
[1:29:59] Sanding right here. He's learning on
[1:30:00] you.
[1:30:02] You see, it's a lot for mature people
[1:30:04] that are used to feeding up here. And
[1:30:07] then you got immature, younger
[1:30:08] preachers, and they start up here. And a
[1:30:11] pastor has to forfeit a lot of stuff for
[1:30:14] a preacher to learn how to preach. It
[1:30:16] ain't just the pastor. It's the sheep.
[1:30:20] So, they're used to eating this course
[1:30:22] meal and that and that and that and
[1:30:24] settling sometimes for a bologn
[1:30:26] sandwich.
[1:30:28] But what I've instructed young preachers
[1:30:31] that have asked me,
[1:30:33] if you will walk out there with respect
[1:30:35] and treat them with that kind of respect
[1:30:37] and keep before you that they have heard
[1:30:40] some of the greatest men of God that are
[1:30:42] alive on the face of the earth today,
[1:30:47] but they will let you learn on them and
[1:30:51] they will give you their time and they
[1:30:53] will give you their amens if you respect
[1:30:56] them. But if you walk out there, I'm a
[1:30:58] man of God. I'll tell you one thing. I'm
[1:31:01] this and I'm that and I'm that. You
[1:31:04] might as well just to hook a gun and
[1:31:11] Paul even mentioned about a man becoming
[1:31:13] a pastor that was a novice. Anybody know
[1:31:15] what that means? Unskilled,
[1:31:18] young in the ministry.
[1:31:21] Some noviceses have been around for 20
[1:31:23] years, but they're still noviceses. just
[1:31:25] watch the decisions they make.
[1:31:29] So what does God want? Men that will
[1:31:31] equip
[1:31:33] equip. Some will equip you with
[1:31:36] repentance. Some will equip you by
[1:31:37] bringing your faults. Some will equip
[1:31:39] you by building your faith. Some will
[1:31:41] equip you with other things. But the
[1:31:43] thing, that's what church is for.
[1:31:47] I hope somebody's got a little bit more
[1:31:48] equipment after the service tonight.
[1:31:51] Yeah. So, what do you say we don't leave
[1:31:55] right now?
[1:31:57] What do you say we kind of follow the
[1:31:59] example of our Eleer? The message was
[1:32:02] cutting.
[1:32:06] Anybody got any full body wrap
[1:32:08] band-aids?
[1:32:10] I don't buy them in them little teeny
[1:32:11] tiny boxes. I laugh at them kind. I need
[1:32:13] a mummy fight bandage sometimes when the
[1:32:16] Lord gets done with me. But I know he
[1:32:19] loves me.
[1:32:21] Aren't you glad he won't let you get by
[1:32:22] with sin? Can we worship him just a
[1:32:25] little? Before we go,
[1:32:30] let's just open our hearts now.
[1:32:33] Just talk to him.
[1:32:35] Tell him what you need.
[1:32:38] Tell him what he means to you. Now
[1:32:40] remember, we've not just come to get and
[1:32:43] receive. We've come to give back.
[1:32:48] Now he's equipped and he's spoke to us
[1:32:50] and whipped us a little bit. Maybe now
[1:32:53] it's our time. He don't need no whipping
[1:32:55] himself. He don't need no correcting
[1:32:57] from us. But I'll tell you what he does
[1:33:00] want.
[1:33:02] I read it up at brother Mike's this past
[1:33:04] weekend. Brother Bam said that God is
[1:33:06] hungering and thirsting
[1:33:10] and begging
[1:33:12] for hungry hearts
[1:33:14] that he can make love to.
[1:33:17] I don't want him begging around this
[1:33:19] place. I hope we never gather here and
[1:33:24] the Lord Jesus has to beg any of us to
[1:33:27] say amen or raise our hands
[1:33:31] or worship him.
[1:33:35] Let's praise him together.
[1:33:38] Lord
[1:33:39] God
[1:33:41] Almighty,
[1:33:45] you are clothed in majesty.
[1:33:49] [Music]
[1:33:53] The heavens declare
[1:33:56] your wonder.
[1:34:00] You are great and do marvelous.
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:08] For you alone
[1:34:11] our God our God.
[1:34:14] Hallelujah. There is no one else like
[1:34:19] you. Oh, let's worship him now, saints.
[1:34:22] Let the nations declare
[1:34:27] that you have done great things.
[1:34:33] You have done great things.
[1:34:37] Mighty you are. Hallelujah. Holy you
[1:34:42] are. Let's just close our eyes and see.
[1:34:46] Raise your hands. Forever
[1:34:49] more. Let your work inside your eyes.
[1:34:53] You are
[1:34:55] great. You are my God. I will exalt you.
[1:35:00] Oh Lord,
