my head and Brother Louie text me and asked me I thought it'd be a good idea to sing it but now I feel like Harry needs to sing it [Music] seems like all I could see was the struggle haunted by Ghost and lived in my [Music] past bound up in Shackled of all my [Music] failures oneing how long is this going to last then you look at this prison and say to me son stop fighting a fight that's already been won I am redeemed you set me free so I'll shake off these heavy chains wipe away every stain I'm not who I used to [Music] be I am redeemed all my life I've been called [Music] unworthy Nam by voice of my shame and regret but when I hear you whisper child lift up your head I remember oh God you're not not done with me yeah I am redeemed you set me free so I'll shake off these heavy chains wipe away every stain I'm not who I used to be because I don't have to be the old man inside out of me his day is long dead and gone because I've got a new name a new life I'm not the same and a hope that will carry me [Music] home I am redeemed you set me free so I'll shake off these heavy chain wipe away every stain I'm not who I used to be oh God I'm not who I used to be I am [Music] redeemed praise the Lord for that are you happy to be in the house of the Lord today let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16 if you would let's look at a little bit today of why we're not who we used to be and what it was about us that has changed and is changing that's one thing about Christianity it's not like you get it all on day one and you stop growing stop learning stop getting more and more of God when we stop we're either backslid or we've moved beyond the curtain of time we want to keep on growing don't we 1 Corinthians chapter 2:16 for who hath known the mind of the Lord that that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ for who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ I find such a paradox in that statement whenever we truly receive the mind of the Lord we're not going to try to instruct him actually instead of us trying to change the mind of God when we pray we pray God will change just to fit his mind for who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him that we have the mind of Christ now look at the meaning of this word understanding judging the capacity for Spiritual truths The Faculty of perceiving divine things of recognizing goodness and of hating evil the power of con considering and judging soberly calmly and impartially it's easy to see from the meaning of this one word the majority of Christendom in this day does not have the mind of Christ they cannot judge between right and wrong they cannot judge between light and darkness I find that so sad with the world out here but what I find even more sad is among how many Christians can they can look right at something that's as wrong as wrong can be and off the word off the word just totally off the word and they'll look right at and say I don't see nothing wrong with it that is scary I said that is scary now watch Paul again in Romans chapter 8 verse 6 for to be carnally minded wow is death to just just to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind and listen what we were when we were born because the carnal mind is in enmity against God I want you to notice the way he says it he doesn't say that the carnal mind is at enmity against God but the carnal mind itself is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so it's not like them that our carnal mind one day will just finally give in and it'll just comply to God it's totally impossible the carnal mind can never be subject to the law of God I'll tell you what's bad is when you take a carnal minded person that's not truly been born again and get them Anointed with a religious spirit brother you talking about an a fix because remember a religious devil is seven times worse than any other devil so when a religious devil will anoint the carnal mind it's n an impossibility for a person like that to ever get free on their own we were born carnal and therefore me we must be reborn spiritual we were born carnal let me say that to you again we were born carnal and we must be reborn spiritual I me like to be remembered today as as we pray I got a call from Lance this morning about 8:30 and the doctor had just left his room and U his uh pancreas is doing some B's numbers were down still high but down from what they were um and the doctor tells him it's just going to take some time going to have to be basically on a a liquid diet for weeks possibly even months um so he needs really needs a a touch from the Lord um couple of spots on his liver or the pancreas rather that they're watching just want to make sure that they don't get infected absolutely nothing they can do to keep it from getting infected but we know someone who can don't we yeah of course if it does get infected becomes bad they' have to have part of that removed so we're just trusting the Lord so doctor told him itd have 40% chance of leaving tomorrow 70% chance of leaving on Tuesday so it's just if you don't mind if you just agree age with us together in prayer that the Lord would just help him and touch him and give him strength in his body you have a need a request on your heart today about lifted hand Heavenly Father we counted a great privilege that we could be gathered together here today in your presence with children of God of like Precious faith we thank you Lord Jesus that you've come to the Earth that we might be redeemed as we just heard the song so beautifully sang we were in that captivity of sin seemingly no way out the law could not do it the prophets could not do it so you came yourself and we're so thankful we ask you today Father that you would help us Lord may we realize why we must absolutely must have the Holy Ghost within us there's only one way out of this world in a body change and that is to receive your nature inside of us help me that I can get out of the way father anoint me but please anoint the people as well be mindful of the needs of your children today all the sick father bless your word in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you you may be seated the carnal mind is not only in a state of war with God but the carnal mind itself is actually against God's being it reasons against him it resents him in one way the carnal mind wishes God was not the carnal mind does not like a superior one telling them what to do what they must do this and don't do that and how they have to live the carnal mind feels its wory itself to exalt its own opinions above God's word and God's way and the carnal mind would like to bury the remembrance of God deep within its own perceptions and its own thoughts this is the way every one of us are born with a carnal mind and yet we know reading praying meditating going to church all those things are good but none of that will rid you of the carnal mind you're born with it's sensal it's perverted it's not right it's corrupt it denies the existence of God's power and his word in the way that he wants to be I think what I'm saying to you that the carnal mind may not always deny God's existence but it wants to deny God the right to be able to live in you and I the way he wants to and yet God turns that right around and says I want to take your carnal mind from you and I want to give you access into my mind to where you will no longer struggle against my will but actually my will will be so inside of you and a part of who you are you'll find my will overtaking your own all the self-help books in the world all the professional people you'd be able to go to hear all the preachers and many of the preachers in this modern day they're nothing but psychologist anyway so they just stand in the pull pit and try toy Psy you up you know your psyche brother Brenham used that word a time or two in the message your psyche which is your mental part so they try to use your psyche and give you a religious psychology of how you can be a better person and you try to do things better and just be a better person how can you ever take a snake and make a better snake out of a snake how can you take a hog and make a better hog out of a hog and we were lower than that we were lost we can't do this on our own now listen friend if we're not careful we try to take the message of the hour and work it the same way on people's psyche and try to make them different and then we find out some of them are doing the same things the people out here is doing the message within itself just by memorizing it and reading it will never do it no more than the Bible will but but it takes the power of God to change us from within the the carnal mind is is such an enemy against god notice how brother brandham let me share several things with you here this morning if you don't mind he said sometimes God's ways are so hard that to the human mind to comprehend you just think that it's ridiculous you think God's way and the way that God would do something it seems ridiculous I want to ask you to raise your hands this morning but I wonder how many of us have actually thought that ourself when God would do a certain way or go a certain way or display his will in a certain way and which think that makes no sense at all why in the world would God ever do this or God do that why does God want me to do that why don't want God me to do that it it don't make no sense why would God not want that well you understand what's doing that suffering for you you don't you it's that carnal mind the carnal mind will always try to take God's word and try to minimize the power and maximize the shortcomings it will take the reasons why you cannot do it it will multiply them and the carnal mind will give you every excuse fathomable and it will make perfect sense to you why you cannot do it and explain to you that God perfectly understands that's the carnal mind but the spiritual mind says that's a lie if God says it and God requires it God's obligated to give me the power to be able to live it and somebody said now notice he said faith is ridiculous to the carnal mind ridiculous to the carnal mind it's crazy to anything except God and the one who has Faith then by faith we see we believe the things that our eyes our mind does not declare just because that we believe it so the carnal mind even when a Christian is saved now remember there is an element about you that is totally eradicated by the new birth and there's an element about you that's carnal that will be there until the day you die or the day you are raptured now I don't want to confuse you this morning but there's two Realms of extreme carnality and remember there must be a part of that carnality which must die and that is what Paul is referring to as the mind and yet there is another part which is the flesh because when you look at the New Testament and you see the Word Flesh and you see the word carnal it will be interchanged they will go back and forth for the exact same Greek word so it is sensual now we read it and we think well it's two different things well in one way it is and another way it isn't how many knows you've got the Holy Ghost and believe you've got it today is there a carnal element about every one of you that think you've still got the Holy Ghost you still got a carnal element you have to deal with yeah yeah me too but yet if we've truly got the Holy Ghost then the carnal mind that we had when we were in sin absolutely is dead it no longer exist because if it's not you will never be able to serve God you can never serve god with that carnal newos that you were born with it will not allow you it has such dominance in our life we can never overpower it with psychology you can absolutely look at your wrongs and your shortcomings and make up your mind I'm going to do this I'm going to quit this I'm going to stop that I'm going to do it and have every good intention you may have quotes and and and scriptures on your phone and you pull it up I'm going to do it I'm going to do it I'm going to repeat it I'm going to say it over and over again but if there's not a power within you that eradicates that nature it will overpower you every time because we cannot do it within ourself this is why Paul says it with such an emphasis and makes it absolutely emphatic that the carnal mind cannot be subject to the will of God and yet that's where many Christians are today they still have that carnal mind that thing that they were born with and they're trying to use that psyche and bring it to a state to make it subject to the word and you'll never do it you may subject it for years and years and eventually it will get tired of it and it'll buck up against the word of God and it'll say I'm sick of this I'm out of here I'm not I'm not doing this no more but you see if you're truly born again that old man's dead that force that was in you is no longer a force to be reckoned with because it is dead watch's this in a time of decision now he said we can't reason it out or study it we just only only model our minds up so when we try to reason it out and study it out it just muddles up our mind don't you love these Harvard terms mudel our minds and there's only one way to do it that is to have faith that God promises and God is able to perform and that settles it now watch that some of the things that the carnal mind will say a carnal mind wants God to bring the birthright down to their level so the carnal mind wants to bring the birthright now this is what so many of the preachers of this modern day have to do they have to compromise in order to have a following or a crowd they're going to have to compromise and bring the New Birth the birth right down to a level that you can still drink and have it you can still smoke and have it you can still be addicted to porn you can still be addicted to drugs now we've got Christian drug addicts and we got Christian drunks and we got Christian this and Christian that those words shouldn't even be used together come on now but what do they do it either that if they preach the truth they won't have hardly nobody to preach to because they cannot many of them preachers standing in the pull pit are not born again them themselves they're not born of the spirit of God any man I don't care what denomination he's in or if he's a message preacher if this word is not his father and his absolute he is not born again I don't care what he says I don't care how much he screams jumps runs hollers heals the sick even raises the dead if this word is not his father and his absolute he's not yet born of the spirit of God somebody said so the carnal mind then will reason a carnal mind wants God to bring the birthright down to their level but for me and I believe all true born Christians we meet it on God's level that that's where we want to meet it right but the carnal mind then wants to bring it down now if God will lower it and God one of course but the church's will in order to meet it and then of course they have to make all the excuses God understands why you can't live right God understands the age is so dark and it's just so wicked and so wretched and and nobody can live right anymore nobody's even got the Holy Ghost you know the sad part about it is that that crept into the message years ago and there was preachers that was preaching nobody had the holy ghost that were all waiting on it well it's evident a lot of them didn't have by the way they went but I believe there're still Sons and Daughters of God on the Earth today that have the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost but the carnal mind wants to bring it down then if God will lower his standard to the level of the carnal mind then the carnal mind has no problem then releasing that individual's body and letting them go to church and say well I'm a church member I belong to this church why because the standard has been lowered because the carnal mind has this built-in mechanism of self-defense it does not want to die it does not want to die because it knows there is no Resurrection to a carnal mind in other words it's that first nature that you were born with I I cannot imagine how awesome that it must have been in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve were there in the presence of God and day by day we don't know exactly how long they were there but father would come down in the evening and he would lay them down and he'd stretch out Adam's arm and he would lay Eve over on her arm and he'd say children how was your stay on Earth today Papa has come down to kiss you good night and the tiger and the lion and all the animals would come up in the garden and they would come up in the evening time to the Cathedral of trees and there the wind would begin to blow and the presence of God would come down on the pillar of fire would hang among the bushes and papa would come oh and they just sensed his being all around them they never thought anything about murder or death or sickness or gossip or lying or anything like that because they had truly the first round of the spiritual mind and then when they walk away from the program of God you see it wasn't just them that fell but since this planet here belong under man's jurisdiction that the planet of Earth fell we know it's groaning this very day Desiring to be clothed upon with its Millennium garments and then for the eighth day to be dressed for the city itself to come down and Adam not was on not only the only one that fell but the Earth fell the animals fell they a lion never looked at his sheep and looked at it as lunch you know a wolf never looked at a little lamb and looked at it as supper so when Adam fell everything under his jurisdiction fell with him and all of a sudden there was a carnivorous nature that begin to raise up in the lion in the cheetah and I've been there in the PLS of the serengetti and you watch them and there's something that's just as natural for them to kill as it is natural for us to be a human being where did that come from it was never there in the beginning it was never there for Adam to ever struggle with old age it was never there and when that image of God left him all the Supernatural part that went out and something else that moved in and you watch that carnal mind display and whenever the voice of God come walking in the garden in the cool of the day as it was and he said Adam Adam where are you and he said I I'm afraid I'm afraid and I hid myself I heard your voice in the garden who told you that you were naked have you eaten of the tree of which I told thee that thou should us not eat so there goes the spiritual mind from him and then this carnal mind self-defense excuses notice the first display of it have you eaten of the tree all the woman that thou gave me she's the one that done it then notice here comes a woman well it wasn't me exactly was the serpent he begal me and I did eat oh and the carnal mind starts defending and making excuses well don't sit there and look at me like Adam was the only one every one of us here today had the same thing and I do hope had is past tense for a lot of us but whenever we're born again then God projects his own mind a piece of intelligence from deity which makes us think different thoughts now we still have our own human mind and the human mind will still reason the human mind will still but God I don't understand why you do that Lord why why that that don't make any sense to me why would you do that but think of it those of you that have the Holy Ghost that is only your human noos that is not that thing that Adam gave you by the Fall now it's so similar they're twins and people will false identify that carnality left in their human element and they will talk themsel out of being born again and they'll sink I'm I'm not different because that still raises up it always will because it's in this the Greek word is SARS S a RX and it's to carnal sensual part of you your flesh still ain't got the Holy Ghost come come on now your flesh still ain't got the Holy Ghost that's why you can't trust it it's an animal it's an animal is that right but yet the carnal mind watch brother R says one man could read Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the carnal mind will say well in a way he is the spiritual mind will say in every way he is now the carnal mind then will say well sort of but he he don't do those things he did in the book of Acts he does in our church he does in lots of churches around the world that I know of but there are many many carnal matter well that was for the apostles and we don't need tongues anymore and we don't need Miracles anymore I beg to differ with that I think we need them now more than we've ever needed them we got more sick people we we need the power of God to transform don't we but the carnal man will say well yeah sort of I mean God you know I mean he can save people and he can do things but as far as Miracles and signs and wonders and things like that we've got doctors we do and then there and thousands and thousands of people are dying every day under the care of them doctors so the doctors do not have the perfect answer for everybody is that right so the carnal mind then will say now notice the carnal mind doesn't always say well there's not even a god some carnal minded people people will say well there is a God yeah there's a God and he can save but he can't heal wonder how come wonder how he can save you but he can't heal you after he saves you that makes no sense to me well he can save but he can't give you the Holy Ghost well I'm not sure if he can't give me the Holy Ghost if he can really save me the word saved is a great big word when you look at what all it involves and what it absolutely the miraculous thing that it does when it saves you it takes a a pretty big miracle for God to save a lost man or woman I figure if he can save me he can heal me if he can heal me in F me with the Holy Ghost if he can fill me with the Holy Ghost he can Rapture my body but the carnal mind will say well in a way he is but the spiritual mind will say in every way he is he gave a commission go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature these sign shall follow them that believe the carnal mind will say that was for the apostles so it lets you know we have some carnal-minded preachers in this message because there's carnal-minded preachers that say well we don't need that no more we're up here at the top we don't need it I'll show you where he put it in the Bible you show me where he took it out but carnal Minds still want to say the same thing the spiritual mind will say he's the same yesterday today and forever into all the world I am part of it how many can say you're part of it notice again he said now we find out these Revelations come and a man hears it he recognizes it to be God then he acts on it the carnal mind hears it and said foolishness foolishness and walk away from it so watch now so the carnal mind will still allow some people to be very religious so they get that carnal mind with this religious demon on them oh my goodness you talking about arguing Bible they love to argue the Bible they love to study it in order to try to trip people up to prove it he's the same yesterday today and forever and to prove that he has not changed and they get that devil on them Lord have mercy they'd be better off there's a drunk you can be able to get to them a whole lot easier than you can with that religious thing on them but yet notice he says the carnal mind shuns it because a carnal mind knows nothing about it no wonder the carnal mind doesn't know it listen because it's Satan do you understand what you had when you were lost the devil was in your soul oh the devil was in your mind yes sir God and the devil can't be in there at the same time so the carnal mind or the nature the soul but because it's Satan in the carnal mind then that must die and Satan is exposed and Satan does not want himself exposed so then after we're born again we have access then into the mind of Christ now when we get there then we start seeing things in a total different way we start believing things in a way that we can never believe with the carnal mind now we could be religious with a carnal mind go to church with a carnal mind believe in a heaven believe in a Hell believe in a devil believe in a God all of that with a carnal mind and yet never truly experience him in the new births now watch in Romans 12: 2 Paul says be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind renewing look at this word a renewal a renovation complete change for the better now remember we're not talking about your brain we're not talking about the cells and the brain matter in your skull but we're talking about the spiritual aspect that anoints your reasoning your thinking your mentality your perception your ability to judge between right and wrong look how dark it is look how dark it is people don't know if they're a man or a woman amen we're going to help buy some Bibles for a country in Africa some of the our believing brothers and sisters have never owned a Bible since they've been a Christian so we're working with brother Jeff Snodgrass and some other brothers so he called me one day this week and was telling me that they were trying to find some in the country there to see if we could save the Duty and all of that of buying it here because it cost a tremendous amount of money to do it so he contacted a Bible Society there in that country one of the brothers there that we're working with and he got back with brother Jeff and told him that this Bible society is changing their versions of the Bible and they're making the version of their Bible gender neutral so I told him I said I am not interested in buying no body no gender neutral Bible Well he said I knew you wouldn't he said we wouldn't either now can you imagine so they're so-call Christians and they're printing these Bibles and handing them out in these countries of Africa and I know this side it's an international society and they are handing them out all over the world now many of these people that don't know the difference are going to pick this up and read this because they've never had a Bible in their Liv so they're going to read this and and they're going to think in their mind well you mean God is neither a man or a woman and uh he and her and she and him and all that we're not going to read that no more that ain't going to be there now we're not talking about a story book we're not talking about Cosmopolitan magazine or Hot Rod Magazine or something like that we're talking about God's word and yet so-called Christians are so spineless and it becomes such cowards you're preaching with me this morning I'm going to lay her down they have become so puny and so weak come on somebody and they ain't nothing but a bunch of Barnyard chickens and they're scared to death to tell the truth and preach the truth my God is Not neutral my God is a he and his bride is a she he made an Adam and an eve male and female created he them and called their name [Applause] Adam so someone from our church went through seven Brew to get a drink the other day and there was this thing that was there well to the individual that went through that looked like a Hy to them so they identified it as a hym but that shim wanted them to know that was not its pronoun that's not my pronoun now don't get quiet I me they've done seen your face on these cameras you might as well say Amen they know you're here they've seen your cars some of y'all was going to start Waring false faces to church ain't you be Hall Halloween every day of the year that's where we're coming to friends why carnal and then you've got theologians and you've got Deans and the religious college and the our our Administration that's in the White House they're blotting this out and we can't say he no more and she no more and him him no more and her no more speak for yourself I'm going to say he I'm going to say she I'm going to say him I'm going to say her my God ain't no pervert and I ain't no pervert come on somebody I've got the ability to discern right from wrong and I've got the ability to tell a difference between a man and a woman dear Jesus who is that for notice this the prophet says we have faith in our heart the faith of God in our heart and we can see it clear it becomes a faith then we speak it and it comes into existence amen because the mind of Christ is in the m man that's what makes healings and so forth when you get that perfect Revelation you just what you're doing then you know how to walk now do we miss it many times of course we do y'all ever felt the Lord spoke to you about something and it proved out it wasn't the Lord after all go ahead go ahead come on be bre be brave there you go there you go how many times have we heard people say the Lord told me this and the Lord told me that well you know what sometimes we don't know if the Lord did or didn't but we can be able to tell if it comes to pass or if it doesn't come to pass so that element is always there that's the scary part about the supernatural because the supernatural will push you out into a realm that sometimes it's uncharted waters and you don't have a scripture for it and you don't have one against it so you really don't know and Satan loves that realm as well as God does but every Born Again child of God wants to be Supernatural how many wants to be a supernatural spiritual daughter of God Son of God we do we want to walk in the realm of the spirit but there's an element of fear that goes along with it why because Satan himself is an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing that he can transform his ministers as Ministers of righteous so you mean the devil has got preachers way more than God does actually it don't take near as many for God to do more than what the devil can ever do so the devil has to have more and he still can't do the the negative effect of what God can do with a handful in a positive side well I wish somebody would say Amen but you see there's an element there that whenever we get the mind of Christ and God projects something to us and we really feel like it's the Lord but we can always check it remember the prophet said when you feel led to do something check it with the word make sure it's you that you're called to do it and you're the one that's supposed to do it and all that and he said then put it with the word and consult your pastor amen well praise the Lord that's what he said now notice in proof of the Resurrection before this certain thing called the new birth ever happens to the man he cannot go away at all to understand or either ever understand God or have any knowledge of God though the word speaks it his mind can't comprehend it so the word speaks it and he can read it right there in black and white and read the literal words of Jesus and read and he can actually read it but his mind I just don't understand it I I just I just can't get it I just he just can't do it until God begins to work on that Soul that's right now watch he says his mind can't comprehend it because it's a human mind he's got to have the mind of God in him to understand Godly things see so all the reading all the schools all the teachings as good as they may be yet that's not the real principle yet the human mind is an enemy to God you've got to get out of your own human mind and be born a new by the Holy Spirit and get the mind of God in you then you you can believe those things then it becomes a reality now that's intellectual faith that will work in the human mind it will allow you to believe a certain element about God but if someone talks you into it someone else can talk you out of it but if God ever birs his mind think of what he does he not only takes his chemistry of his blood and cleanses out our sin and absolutely annihilates it all but he takes that sinful nature out that we were born with which is associated with your mind your psyche and removes that and puts in the very mind of God and he can project to you visions and Revelations and Supernatural elements it's a communication that only the initiated share right years and years ago in the wars they had what they call the code talkers how many knows are I'm talking about the code talkers so the Navajo the Navajo was some of the most famous ones and the naval hold they had their own language and then they was able with the military to develop this language and it was called Cod talk now of course what the Germans would try to do they would try to catch up the frequencies of the Americans and the Americans would do exactly the same thing for them and everything they tried to use and they would try to say things in such a way we're going to move this Battalion over here and you know the Air Force is coming in this way and that way and the Germans would pick it right up and they'd be ready well the Americans did the same thing of course so they develop the C- talkers so the c-t talkers would get on the radio and they go to talking in tongues well that's what it would sound like to the Germans anyway so they was actually talking in a language and the person that had the radio on the other end they knew exactly what they were saying and the Germans are scratching their head trying to figure out what in the world are they talking about and they never did never they never listen to me they never did break that code they never did figure it out as a matter of fact some of those Navajo men that did that are just now getting their due respect and reward for what they did because there was lots of lives that were saved because of it and helped turn an element of the war because of that and God developed code talking before the foundation of the world so God knew what Satan would do so God developed a way by which he would be able to talk to his own by means of Revelation and Satan he knew would be able to read the Bible don't you understand why God stripped Revelation and why he stripped the spirit from the letter of the word the letter kill us but the spirit maketh alive so if the letter if the letter alone would have everything you need every devil in hell can live the way they want to live then before the end time comes they'll pick up that Red Letter Bible put it under their arm walk right in the gates because they've got the truth right under their arm but they know that Bible better than any of will ever know it as far as knowledge but they don't have the proper radio for code talking Oh Glory so whenever they hear it they don't understand it it makes no sense to them and they see you and I changed by the power of God and they can't understand how could we be changed we were born like everybody else look at everybody in our family look at the way they turned out you should have been the same way or worse but you're not why you you received your own personal receiver called predestinated seed that gave you the ability when father spoke your name something inside of you woke up and said yes my Lord yes my Lord what is it you responded to the code talking oh Hallelujah that was wonderful when that happened but that was just the beginning of your code talk language as a matter of fact the code come back to you to get Sanctified and then the code come back to you to get the Holy Ghost and then the code come back to you that there was a message in the land brought by a prophet of God come on somebody let's have church this morning I don't mind telling you the real elect of God are still here in code talk and they are responding to the code talk and the code talk saying don't go there don't go here don't get caught up in that and those that have the receiver said yes sir exactly right sir thank you for that message and the devil said what he say what' he say I don't understand what he said but the code talkers understand exactly and before long we're going to receive another message Hallelujah and the dead in Christ which were also part of the code talker are going to rise from the dead and we which are alive and REM remain will hear from the Cod talk and we will be changed in a moment woo [Applause] Hallelujah go ahead right thank you Jesus the devil said what did he say do you understand what he said I couldn't hear it I got as close as I could but I couldn't understand it Jesus said you're mine you're my seed I I chose you before the world begin have no fear I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you and the devil said I don't know what it was I had him talked out of going to church I had him pump talked out he wouldn't want to serve God no more and that little old buzzer went off on that funny looking radio that he carries down inside of his soul Hallelujah and I he must have got some kind of message cuz I seen that frown turn upside down and I seen a smile come on her face and I said her get up go ahead and iron her clothes and say well I think I'll go ahead and go to church and I said oh no I didn't think she was going to church today she's a code talker he's a code talker Hallelujah why they've got the ability to hear from heaven and they don't just hear it through the preacher they hear it through their own soul you have to move your thoughts you have to move your sinking get away from reason and move your thoughts from your own way of thinking to what God thinks let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you then when you begin to think his thoughts you'll begin to live his life oh my Lord so when you begin to think God's thoughts you begin to live God's life should I reckon God is living in a world of depression sadness nobody loves me poor me we'll never get no higher until we get out of our sinking and live in the thinking I am loved I am cared for he left heaven for me I have value come on somebody let me tell you something I was looking back through the rest of my notes I still ain't got all that confession stuff done that I preached to you months and months ago I was looking at this week I thought Lord have mercy I've been out there in this big Boomerang going way out here if the Lord teres will get back at it again but I begin to look at some of the stuff that the Lord had given me to write down I thought oh my Lord this ought to bring a Revival to a bad this much less a real bride message member to be able to look and see everything that you are in Christ Jesus you are forgiven you are Justified you are Sanctified you are called you are elected you are ordained or predestinated you are undefeatable Hallelujah you are undefeatable you cannot go to hell you cannot be lost you cannot perish you are absolutely a word born child of God there is nothing that will ever defeat you I don't care what the devil does I don't care what Satan ever does he'll never be able to stop this predestinated bride she is the word you cannot stop the [Applause] word now do you realize all that big fat mouthful I just said ain't my SS I would have never said that a few years ago until I got my radio Dar yes yes yes Lord yes yes you going to have to think my thinking okay Lord teach me teach me Donnie tell your people they are me because I become them I become them that they might become me tell them Donnie they're looking at the wrong thing tell them I place my own self inside of them now I feel like another language coming on woo Glory [Applause] you have to get away from your reason move your thoughts from your own way of thinking to what God thinks oh my you begin to think his thoughts you begin to live his life and do the things he did you see what I mean now because it's not you it's Christ we cannot alter God's word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking I still think too much like a Reagan you still think too much like a Martin a gillus a Palmer A Smith a Weber come on somebody I want you to notice he doesn't say God Alone will do this but we have to alter our thinking let the mind of Christ be in you then you'll think like he thinks praise God you've got to completely Surrender Your Own thoughts your own will your own mind and let the mind of Christ operate in you now when you notice you do think Christ would the mind of Christ in you would say the days of Miracles is passed do you think the mind of Christ and you would say the Bible's right in some places and not in others the mind of Christ would sanction every word that Christ ever said amen now there's human faith and there's the faith of God and you must have Godly Faith to believe now then to have Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you that's how God projects how many knows what a projector is okay you're looking at the effects of two of them right here right there's one over there's the other one a projector the screen does not have the ability to put those words upon itself there's another one right back here so the brothers control it from their computer there which I send them these quotes scriptures images whatever I want them to project they downloaded I sent it to Jackie Tipton Michael Bailey audio support and Dawning just in case they all lose theirs so we all get it every service then they upload it to the computer so you can be able to read it there and it comes from this projector now there's a line of course that's tied into it but if I put up a b CDE E F G H I J K L M N O P that's what you're going to see if I put up a a picture of the Eiffel Tower that's what you're going to see so it comes from the head to the head through the Machinery to the body amen and the body can sit there and say m m m boy that is so good man that is some kind of good eat you know that brother B said a horse eating Clover that you go to church and I mean you're just having to sat there there and wipe your mouth from the Holy Ghost slobbers that's around he say Lord that is so rich that is so good I'm tell you what my daughter Lista she makes some of the best desserts you ever ate in your entire life but them things are so rich oh my goodness you about go in a sugar shock whenever you eat them but they are really good oh that's the kind of word I want to be able to feed you all I don't want to just high dose you on sugar I want some protein I want some nutrients I want some vitamins I want some things that you need you'll be able to walk out of here and say where'd that devil go anyhow where'd that devil go we want to be able to leave this place charged by the power of God not just while we're here but when we walk out of there we're armed and ready we are soldiers because it's been projected Amen to us now then to have Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you that's how God projects to you Visions Revelations I mean he's got a revelation of the serpent seed it wouldn't make no difference what doctor of theology what preacher anybody else tried to talk you out of it the father projected it to you and you may have read Genesis 3 for years and years but one day it came through the proper Channel and it was projected right there in your walkie-talkie and all of a sudden it just opened up so I'm like glory to God that serpent seeds of the devil I say glory to God it sure is the doctrines a revelation from God but the serpent seed is definitely of the devil I mean literally of the devil could they take that away from you how can these people that's walked away from the message in the last several years done what they've done I'll tell you why the father never projected it to their soul they read it in a book and somebody else talked them into it and somebody else talked them out but if it's a revelation there ain't enough devils in hell to get it out of you the Devil Himself could not get it if he aggravated you every day you'd look over him and say get on back down to hell I've done been projected by the power of God I've got a built-in screen I've got a built-in receiver you can't have my [Applause] Revelation I wonder how many of you the Satan has tried his best to steal it from you Jesus looked at Peter that day and said Simon Simon Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as sweat sift you as sweat but I have prayed for you that your Fai will not fail and when you are converted strengthen your brethren well I guarantee one thing if Jesus PR prayed for Peter I'd say he's mentioned my name a few times I'd say brother Rob he's mentioned you I'd say sister s's mentioned you brother D's probably mentioned you I'd say more than likely everybody in this building today the Lord Jesus has called your name Hallelujah aren't you glad we've got a high priest right there before the presence of God father father give them strength send the angels of God dispatch them down to you and be able to project to you that Revelation and through all the storms it holds on through all the sickness it holds on I got a thing from one of my Minister friends not long ago and said brother Donnie the devil wasn't just after sister Erica's house he was after her faith I thought yeah that was it and he said not only hers but yours but he said through this whole thing she was faithful as I mentioned to you the other day lances on the same floor down the hospital Elizabeth and where Erica was in a room directly across the aisle from where Erica was and where Erica left us from that room and I thought oh Lord why did I have to be why did I have to be but I don't know how many nurses has come into the room where he's been s there telling him how they were affected by Erica's life I took the girls down there to see him the other day and two of them come in and standing there crying one lady said she had been in medicine for 28 years and hadn't cried for nobody until she met Erica I thought praise God a life lived by the word is the word word expressed not a preacher not a deacon and some of you saying well I've never done nothing from God live a life by the word you are doing what demons cannot do you don't have to be a preacher Sisters You Don't Have To Be A preacher young people let God live his word out of you let God project to you visions and Supernatural something another and you are doing something that great people socalled will never be able to touch amen amen yes Hallelujah yes sir you cannot keep your Same Spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same thoughts you got to die you got to die like he died you got to die on The Altar like Abel did with his lamb if you haven't heard this sermon you must be born again in Ohio 1961 it's awesome it's absolutely awesome youall to listen to it again he died you've got to die die on his altar like Abel did with his land you've got to die with your lamb Abel died with his lamb you've got to die with yours Christ Jesus you've got to die got your own thinking to be born born to his thinking always Marvel I don't think science yet even to this day has figured it out how that some people can go into a coma I heard of a few of them in Co and they went into a coma and say they spoke English and they come out of the coma speaking French they didn't know one word of French well maybe go see McDonald's and say French for but here they come out and they're you've heard of that haven't you people going into a coma and then all of a sudden they come out and it's like they don't know one more word of English but something happens when they were out and they come to speaking another language right and you think how is that even possible that a person would get this vocabulary in their brain and speak it fluently I'm not someone saying french fry and crepe and leaning Tire of pizza and you know this and but they come out speaking fluent language so you imagine a person dying they are the altar of Christ and they die and they come back to life again and they raise talking code talk they rais talking God talk I'm a Christian I'm a Believer I love the Lord Jesus people say I never thought I'd ever he hear him say that I've heard him say the name of Jesus before but it wasn't that way wow I never thought I'd ever what in the world happened to him he died and woke up speaking another language he died and when he come to he was so different because the mind which was in Christ Jesus come in him there is the soul you got to think his thoughts the word of God always attracts the spiritual mind because it is the mind of Christ in you that knows that the word is true one this we're going to have to be one with him let the mind that was in Christ be in you then Christ his own mind in you will recognize every word that he wrote this is why people can dissect well I believe this part I I believe John 3:16 I sure a't taking that acts 238 well then Christ is not in you cuz Christ in you knows acts 238 is the words just like John 3:16 here praise the Lord not it let the mind that was in Christ is that what the Bible said the mind that was in Christ me in you what kind of mind did he have stay with the word spoken words original see the mind that's in Christ in you the mind's in Christ and you will take the word just like he did because he was the word paragraph page 97 paragraph 5 let your walks your talks your moves everything you do be in the word of God let the mind of Christ come into you that'll pregnate you with the word if you if you don't let the denominational mind come in you you become denominational pregnated if you let the mind of Christ come in you he can't deny his own word CU he's God now remember when he's studying for this sermon spoken words Original Seed and the spirit of God spoke to him and said pick up your pen and write you believe whatever you wish to I believe it's the same author that told Paul to pick up his do you brother Jonathan I love this here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has the th saith the Lord don't you understand friend many message people have got the word for this day but it's evident they don't have the mind they don't know what to do with it they argue they fuss they debate they make Cults out of it I understand why some people look at some of the message far and say them people ain't nothing but a cult I understand I'll call some of them a cult cuz that's what they are why they get the word but they don't get the right mind so they look at it and they read it and they put their own Thoughts with the message and then they come up with all this ult ideas but the bride not only gets the books and the tapes she gets the mind to know what to do with the books and the tapes so the real bride members of Christ they don't get the books and the tapes and say well I don't need to go to church no more I don't need a pastor no more they're missing the mind of Christ if you get the books and the tapes and then and you hear the prophet say say what the tapes say not push play what the tapes play but say what the take come on somebody and that ain't just for the preacher that's for you to say what the tape say oh let the mind that was in Christ be in you if that same mind's in there with the same power that's in there you'll do the same works that he did let the mind of Christ being in you and it molds the character of a Son of God just listen a minute how can we have the mind of Christ that was in him and then deny the things he commissioned us to do how can we place miracles in the past amen when the very Christ himself was God and God in you in the presence of God Amen there's always miracles is that right brother Paul in the presence of God there is always miracles let me find a place some wind down in the seventh seal now remember this is the Eighth Day The Eighth Day of the seal series last service he's been the presence of God Alone each angel came each day with a revelation of the mystery of that seal which was made known only unto them is't that awesome can you imagine how awesome it must have been on the day when the seven seal is going to be opened and he sees his own Angel no longer Paul Luther Wesley yeah right well I'll give you something to think about anyway at least some of you wait now the seventh angel held the mystery of that seven seal that one angel that I looked at had notable look about remember I told you had his wings all stuck out that one notable Angel the one that meant more to me than all the others the thing I've wondered about my whole life what was it The Mystery of the seventh seal he had an attachment to the seventh seal head he didn't mention about the first second third fourth fifth six but he wondered about the seventh seal his whole life why his radio was tuned for the seventh age amen aren't you glad yours is too look friend let's just face the fact that's what's wrong with some of these people around the message they're radio a ready tuned for the 7th e they're tuned for some Pastor some somewhere they're tuned for some preacher on the internet I'm so glad mine is tuned to Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 1-7 come on somebody I tell you one thing as long as I'm alive and in my right mind and the pastor of this church I'm still going to preach the value and the importance of God's Prophet Messenger to this age we need to hear what he said we need to say what he said it's going to be what he said that's going to build a rapturing faith in our souls and get us out of here so here he's nearly beside himself by the eth day he answers questions that morning and answers them wrong you know he just beside himself and somebody called it and and he called it one of them and then so he just talks about this the pray leaving up to this paragraph 35 and he's talking about being weary and being the presence of God and he said may I just pass this to you when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ and you become so far away from your own thinking to your own mind you'll see those marks I put there because he went on down to explain it a little bit more and he said he tried to explain he said well just just let me not not try to explain it because it can't be explained so when the the supernatural comes in there's the mind of Christ let's stand let's jump down to the next quote here Brothers Let's skip these scriptures are in Ephesians 4 we'll pick it up again we r on next time we buried that first nature that first nature is gone now we are in the nature of him he lives in us we don't do our own will we do his will we don't think our own thoughts the mind the mind is what thinks the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there there is the soul there is the soul what is the soul tells us over and over again the soul is the nature of your spirit so he said your body didn't die your spirit didn't die but your soul died I've quoted that to y'all for years don't get so quiet your soul which was the nature of your spirit you see some people have the marriage of the Lamb an invisible Union they have it that God took that old nature and that old soul and saved it washed it cleaned it all up and made it new he could never say about that old soul that you never sinned in the first place right right but there was a seed laying there a soul of God which was in God before the foundation of the world that's from your Prophet messenger now a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world so you must bring that own nature LED on the altar of God with your sacrifice and the spirit of God comes down and kills that nature and then a phoenix transpires then that new nature that seed which laay there dormant for years for decades sometimes it caught the breath of life that's the part that when he refers to you never did it in the first place it wasn't that you were just forgiven you were forgiven of that old life yes but that old nature is dead de annihilated gone forever now remember that nature in a sense was feminist gender I can see why Satan wants to go that way because it messes up the whole program of God so God projected a part of his own self that little C genan of you you were in his thinking you see when I was born J ju the 9th 1956 and whenever I took the breath of life I don't know how long it was of course I didn't know my mama before that time but I know she was a sweet lady when I knew her according to what we're taught in the message of there Mama must have got a little bit sweeter cuz that little Angelic body was hovering around Mama waiting for this human Tabernacle to be born of a union between Dawn and Betty Reagan I went along been born a little Reagan a little Heathen didn't know nothing about God but didn't go to church but one day Mama went to church and I could see something happened to Mama daddy drove stock cars and daddy lived like any normal Center you know drink smoke and this and that and the other you don't want nothing to the church so I seen mama and I know there's something different about us I didn't know how to pray so I went to Mama and asked you you've heard me tell this many times mama how do you pray so my uncle was having a rival at his church church and I went and I got down to the Altar and I began to pray they told me I had to be baptized so I said okay so we didn't have a baptistry but we went down to the it was a lake they broke the ice CU it was in January it was real shallow and they busted the ice baptizing me in titles but the little seed started heavenward I come from trinitarian to Jesus only back to I'm not sure then back to Jesus only then I was all over the map many of us had the seven Church ages written in our whole life didn't we but one day one day I was making a radio broadcast for a preacher that I worked for and I did the intro and the outro and then I would play part of his sermon so I'd say you know so and so and so this is so and so and you know here's this and this now you'll hear a fiery sermon preach about so and so and you know and then I would click into the sermon and let it play around 12 12 and A2 minutes something like that and I noticed some books above his little desk though where I was working and I reached up and picked one of them out this man theme song was he was more than a man I finally figured out where that come from but I still had some Pentecostal tradition and I was a proud Pentecostal preacher so Carol was already reading the books and listening to the tapes and so was Harry and they saw it before I did I said I I'll pray about it I'll think about it you you know all right yeah okay I I'll I'll pray about it I'll pray about it but one day God said today is the day and he pull back the veil from that seat I said praise the Lord I shouted I jumped I run I spoke in tongues I done all that in Pentecost but let me be honest with you I never had in my soul what I do now I couldn't have been born under the message of Malachi 4 under Leo Dean preachers right and neither were you I'll tell you when some of you got it when you got under the ministry of A God Called man ministering Malachi four and that's when you truly got born again amen and when that happened the mind of Christ came inise Lord don't want don't you want to live this way don't don't you want this to be your guidepost so you you think this way you talk this way you're a code talker and you pull what you do through the word you pull everything about you through the word because you can trust it how many knows we can't trust oursel we still can't even trust this because this still ain't don't have it this will argue with God I've told you before every controversial sermon that I've ever preached I've known in myself if I do it I'm going to get in trouble I've known if I do it there'll be all kinds of friends that'll leave me are going to blce me this this and this I've got enough sense to know that but the soul says you're going to obey you or you're going to obey the spirit of God right you know from my past record which one I obey right hey that's what we want to be all of our records let the mind of Christ get in you it will Empower you to overcome from every devil of Hell amen right sister suy it's bar it hallelujah oh Lord Jesus how many would like to be remembered today maybe there's some here today and you know you love the Lord Jesus with all of your heart but maybe you've just never stepped into that yet some of you might have the Holy Ghost in your spirit now remember brother Brenham says that Elvis Presley had the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said I know his mother and his Pastor he Incorporated he was an Assembly of God he Incorporated the shouting and the dancing of Pentecost into the rock and roll music and it went over with the world and took them by storm but actually he learned that shaking in church oh my and he brought it to thousands and thousands of young people introducing with others rock and roll and he had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for those who were close friends with Elvis Pressa after every concert they'd either gather on the stage when everybody was gone or Gather in his hotel room the Stamps Quartet worked with him I've heard some of them talk about it and he would always sing religious songs How Great Thou Art Amazing Grace on and on and on but his soul is birth right and his gift to the devil how sad how sad so we want more than that oh may you today if you're standing here with a baptism in your spirit may you just how do I do it brother Don it's quite simple really from the control tower of your soul open up your soul and let God move from your spirit and step into the realm of your soul so a person could be baptized by the Holy Ghost in their spirit and it never be in their soul just like when me or any of these brothers baptize people in this baptistry and we will put our hand to nose you've seen it done many times our hand over their nose and mouth if every Inlet to their body is closed no water will go in their body but they were baptized oh friends let's just make sure let's just make sure that we're not trying to do it ourselves let God step into your soul how do you look at the word how do you judge everything by Feelings by emotions do you judge imp partially you judge one way and then if it's your best friend you judge another way oh that's not the mind of Christ the mind of Christ would judge everything by the word of God hallelujah hallelujah father while we stand here in this awesome presence may this be the day that some of them for the first time will die on The Altar we realize in this world it comes down to two categories of people those who are born once those who are born twice those who are born once miss the Rapture go to the tribulation period and bombs are in the hangers today with our names written on them oh Jesus hide us father hide us Lord God under the covert of thy wings oh I deny as it was when the angel of death moved to the land of Egypt only your people who had obeyed the word Mercy was not given just because they were Jews Mercy was not given because they even lived among the Jews but because they obeyed The Prophet's command from God take the blood take hisp put it over the door roast the lamb eat it with bitter herbs they had to follow that message to the letter they couldn't leave out this one leave out that one I don't think we need this I don't think we need that if they did they perished with the unbelievers and the prophet tells us the last plague that will hit the earth before the Rapture of course is spiritual death people are dying in the masses Lord dying and what's so sad is it's striking message churches too they're letting go of this teaching of the messenger and that one and another and another help us Lord God that we'll hold on to it with everything we are father and never let it go oh Jesus we worship you father We Worship You Lord God we bless your name father in the name of Jesus can we just raise our hands in the presence of the king now let the Lord let the Lord just deal with your heart each of you there's not a question in my mind that many of you have already passed from death into life but for some of you being a pastor I have to wonder knowing that you're up and down and in and out and this and that oh children I'd be less than a servant of God if I wasn't honest with you today and tell you the truth some of you holding grudges in your heart and can't forgive people how can the Holy Ghost dwell in your soul and you not forgive the way Jesus did but it's hard Brother Don I believe me I know it's hard I know it's hard and your flesh may not be able to lead you to it but Jesus and your soul like Jesus and my soul will help us to forgive when that person's name is mentioned over we meet them on the street we have no hatred no animosity in our hearts toward them hallelujah oh Jesus may you sweep down this place today Father hallelujah hallelujah May deaths take place in this service may they climb up the altar of God we know Lord the wrath of God has to fall on our own nature it has to be judged it cannot be raised it must die there on the altar of God it dies and the seed Li from another world is quickened in its place thank you Lord Jesus oh we worship you Lord God there's any sick here among you today I can say to you as a possessor of the mind of Christ that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the Healer of all that diseases you're bound you're oppressed be set free in the name of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah We Worship You Lord God I bless your name Jesus we worship you father now let's just take a few moments before we go go and let's just love him now worship him let's create an atmosphere here that he can be able to move Among Us when know the preaching is one anointing and this kind of changes a little bit Let's us let's just change with it sometimes it takes a few minutes for the channel to to change and go in another Direction but let's just give him a little bit of time after all what do you have to do the rest of the day the it's more important than somebody getting filled with the Holy Ghost somebody getting healed somebody getting set free from a tormenting devil Hallelujah father

thank you Lord God we worship you Lord part of our rights we'll get into it maybe in a week or so part of our rights as the people of God is that we have been called into a new order of priesthood not only are we the temple of God but we serve in that Temple as priests as priests we bring sacrifices one of the prophets of the Old Testament said that we would come to the Lord with words and he also said that we would come with the Cales c a l v s calves of our lips so a calf of course was an offering of the Old Testament but you imagine Hosea seeing it so many years ago and saw that there would come a time that people would come into the presence of God and the sacrifice that they would offer God would be like a burnt offering in the Old Testament and it would simply come from the calves of their lips so your lips today are calves but which you can raise and open your mouths and say Lord Jesus I love you I praise you I adore you I worship you what a privileged people we are can we do that before we go let's change it Harry sing something go in another little Direction there let's just worship him now we don't have a bloody Ram or a lamb to bring to him a turtle dove or a pigeon but these hands at one time held beer cigarettes whatever more filth of the world today they are washed and cleansed and now we can raise Them Up In The Presence of Jehovah our lips which at one time spoke words that should never be uttered out of a human's mouth now we can lift up praise and adoration and worship and God accepts it as from the priesthood of MDC praise God every one of you men women boys and girls are a priest unto the presence of God We Worship You Jesus as a priest father I stand here before my fellow priests we have come to the house of God today I have fulfilled the scripture of Romans chapter 12 verse 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you would present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto the Lord I don't believe I'm the only one I believe others have come here for the same purpose today so we give our bodies as a Living Sacrifice we raise our hands our lips we let your spirit flow through our bodies our lungs take in the breaths that you gave us and push out words of Praise from the calves of our lips will come Divine adoration only you know how to really adore you we would approach it in a carnal means every time but if we can let the mind of Christ be in us we'll worship different than we've ever worshiped before CU it'll be deity inside of us worshiping deity oh Jesus we worship you today Father we bless you Lord how many he wants to present your body as a sacrifice the fruit of your lips as a sacrifice brother Donnie I don't feel like it I don't have much joy that'll make it a greater sacrifice for you then let it be a real sacrifice oh it can be so a sacrifice when it comes from a burdened heart it ain't hard to praise him from a joyful heart but when a heart is so burdened and so troubled and the body is so Afflicted and so sick and then when you offer praise you talking about a sacrifice up in the presence of God oh David said it this way in the Book of Psalms let my prayers be as the evening incense so Lord God our worship our praying Our Praise once we become priests of this new order it goes into a different realm people may look at concerts and they think well we're doing exactly the same thing they are not exactly not exactly most of them are worshiping from the outer court if they're even then that far but the bride your sweetheart is not worshiping from the outer Court we're worshiping from the inner sanctum we've walked in behind the veil and the veil has dropped behind us when know the kings of the Eastern settlements and civilizations they had a holy place in their own Palace the inner sanctum it was called even family members could not go there without being beckoned only the personal private Bodyguards of the king and very select few people ever got there unless of course the king beckoned them to come oh great King I feel you pulling me to come into that inner sanctum to play today into that Holy place oh Jesus to worship to adore I bless your name father let's just worship Him children close your eyes get your mind off your lunch now remember that old that old part of your flesh still there your mind will roam here and there and go somewhere else but just bring it subject to the spirit of God in your soul and say shut up I'm going to worship God for a few more minutes I'm going to praise him so what if this is your last service
