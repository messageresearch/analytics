we pin [Music] me [Music] [Music] praise God for grace the Book of Luke chapter 11 verse 42 Luke chapter 11 verse 42 but woe unto you Pharisees for you tithe mint and Rue and all manner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of God these ought you to have done and not leave the other undone woe unto you Pharisees for you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware of them you imagine this type of a man set that jesus said to deal with with the leaders of that day now as read in James chapter 4 verse 17 James says therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin that's simple but profound in it so if you know to do good and you just simply don't do it that's not that you're drinking or smoking or any of that but these are sins of omission something that you know that you should do and you have the opportunity to pay for today but you just do not do it according to the scripture it is sin may God forgive us all you believe this is true right let me read this to you a sin of omission is a sin that is the result of not doing something God's Word teaches that we should do it is generally used in contrast with the corresponding phrase the sin of commission or sins that a person actively commits so it is something that we know we should do and we just simply don't do it let's pray together Heavenly Father we love you today we're so thankful Lord Jesus for your great mercy we realize as we go on Lord God in time how merciful that you are not only to this world but to us to those of us your children who make such great professions of faith and of who we are we're grateful Lord Jesus that your light is illuminating our paths we're thankful father that you're showing us more and more about you more and more about us we'd like to take a look today not a casual glance but we want to take as it were almost a penetrating x-ray into the mirror of your word that we Heavenly Father might come away from that look and be better people speak to us today Lord in Jesus name we pray amen god bless your children you may be seated I want to speak to you today on three words leaving things and leaving things undone one commentary describes the neglect of known duty in this way it is a sin of knowledge without practice so it's actually knowing something but yet you don't do it now when James was inspired you know James lacked certainly liked the comparative revelation that Paul had on many things there was many things that Paul wrote James he just wasn't he just wasn't enlightened to it but yet the book of James is a very small book his foster brother of the Lord Jesus as you know but yet the things that he did write it God gave him some insight about it and this is one of the things that he addresses without actually Peter nor Paul and one of the rest of them actually did was quite in this same way so God gave him an insight to be able to look at us and he says that therefore to him that knoweth to do good and do is that not to him it is sin and when we think of what God has placed us on the earth is the highest privilege first of all for any of us is to be able to serve the Lord we would agree with that to be able to live for him and to be able to give our lives totally and completely to him then what would be the next greatest privilege that God has given us on the earth the next whether or not you believe it the next greatest privilege is for us to be able to help mankind it is to be able to love God and then to love our neighbor as ourself so to be able to alleviate problems to be able to help people to be able to do what we can to make it better for them it's part of what we're here for and you think that for many people that get secluded in their own little world to where they live to themself and them and their family and the outer ranks of their family and that's pretty much as far as they go they pray for them and they don't really concern themselves with other things it's a very selfish life and it's not a Christ identified life because Christ's life is denying yourself and actually living for others so looking eternal life in the face is when we're doing it now whenever James says this James doesn't just pull this out of the sky and say now to him that knows to do good and you don't do it to you at sim but what is he referring to what doing good is he talking about did he make references prior to this statement was he referring to things that Paul had said was he talking about all good so I would like to look at today by the help of the Lord his things that James had mentioned in his epistle prior to saying this that to know to do good and to do it not to you at sin so what did he set aside but what God had given him that was good for us to do would you like to take a look there this morning mr. King James chapter 1 verse 2 now some of these might seem quite simple to you but I believe they'll be a blessing to you my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations and may believes just the word do you believe this is good do you do it lord help us okay I remember you know this is good this is what the word says right my brethren eyes not speaking the sinners infidels like Gnostics babies speaking to us count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations now these are not temptations from Satan these are not temptations from evil it is not temptations of lusts well not any of us can be able to rejoice whenever we're suffering temptation from the devil that's torment even the Lord Jesus himself suffered temptation so this is not what James is referring to but he's actually using the same concept and the thought of God trying Abraham so whenever God then will try us are we to rejoice whenever the devil tempts us with lust or tempts us with this and that of course not that is the type of temptation that's going to bring very very excruciating spiritual pain to a son and daughter of God it's terrible the things that devil puts in your minds and puts in your heart and all that it's absolutely terrible but whenever God is trying us this is something that the word wants us to do to really count it all joy and to be able to rejoice because our heavenly father is trying us now notice he said my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations which is afflictions or persecutions for the sake of the gospel or even when God Himself is trying your faith as he did Abraham now notice the next verse proves this what I'm saying to you knowing this that the trying of your face worketh patience so here we're not talking about sexual temptation in temptations of the flesh but it when in our faith is being tried by God Himself then we're supposed to count it all joy now this is good but it's not good when we don't do it so whenever we are being tested by God tried by God you're praying and praying and asking God to do something for you and it seemed like God is delay or God isn't answering when you think he ought to instead of us being sad and morbid and all defeated and all down the word says count it all joy now remember James says to him that knows to do good and doesn't do it praise the Lord now God does not afflict us God does not try us because he gets something out of seeing his children suffer from trials from God is never because God is a mean hateful contrary God and it actually brings him some type of joy to watch you go through something but when God and His wisdom allows us to go through something it is for our benefit we believe that knowing it is for our benefit it is for our good then if God will allow our face to be tried why would he do that in order to prove to us he done knows the quality and content of our faith but it is to prove to us that our faith is true and genuine now others are twofold in this that he said knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience so the trial I don't understand how it works but just knowing what the scripture says that the trying of your faith will actually work or produce when it Romans in Romans 5 where Paul said tribulation worketh patience patience experience experience hope hope maketh not ashamed for the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us so there's something about the trying of faith and the outcome of that trying not only makes faith stronger and makes faith to appear more genuine but it actually works patience out of the trying of your faith who but God could tried face and get stronger patience out of that trial who but God was able to figure out such a program that in trying our faith it would actually make our patients John I mean needs more patients how many wants the process to get him praise the Lord it always works out that way tribulation worketh patience of our face will produce this type of patience and then during that time when we look at it can't you see why we should have joy cuz to assent oh my goodness he's trying my face then the outcome of this will give me more patience and I need more pleasure so I'm gonna go ahead and rejoice before I get it but instead we drag and drag and drag and we can't wait til it's over and we hang our heads down and all my wins this ever gonna pass when's it ever going to pass and the longer it goes the worse we get when it should be the longer it goes that means that God is trying us and bringing something out of our patience praise the Lord that should be that now it will come by degrees and remember we do not get this mature type of patience just as soon as we become a Christian give our heart to God but it will come by degrees and God knows better than to try to reach a Natur adult degrees for patience on a new convert it will not work it will want that convert out so God will let it go by degrees notice in James goes on to say but let patience have her perfect to work or the effect which is brought into perfection let patient notice how identifies it as a heard let patience have her perfect work now what is it to denote this sincerity and the strength of what that patience is supposed to be that patients have her perfect work that ye may be perfect which is fully developed in the Christian attributes that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing now how is that going to happen as soon as you and I pray God gives it to us that makes us more impatient than we were before so in this age when everything is instant instant coffee instant potatoes in drive-through instant this instant that instant message and we want instant patience and God said nope I'll still make patience the same way I made it for six thousand years God don't have drive-through character God don't have drive-through patient he has it the same way he's always had it which makes it hard in this little sense some of you want God to start delivering the way Amazon is wanting to start delivering their packages I'm sure you've heard about that everywhere Amazon is one before the Congress and all that well they can get little clothes and little robot type airplanes to wear that if you order some from Amazon they'll drop it right down on your little ports about tomorrow that's the way we want character that's the way we want patience that's the way we want all the things of God but God don't run a drone Factory God don't on the next day delivery God ain't you FedEx or UPS God does it the same way he's always done it and listen it makes it more hard for us than it would the people in the days of Jamestown because in the days of James that did not have text that did not have emails it will take months and months and maybe even a year for you get a letter from one side of the earth to the other unlike us today so everything was much slower pace every single slower but today in the rapid pace of everything and we want God the same way friends we got to slow down and relax and realize it ain't gonna come at our pace so let's read this let patience have her perfect something was getting to offense also did work that she may be perfect and in you can't stand it can you you're wanting to fast forward me so fast you can't stand it why it's part of that layer to see a thing we're living in that you may be perfect and entire which is having all of its parts complete wanting no integral part your whole literally your entire spirit soul and body implies without a blemish and its parts you mean I don't get that by doctrine I don't get that by believing the seven seals or the seven thunders or the butt rouge or or something you mean I can only get this by my faith being tried which renders out patients which producing me the perfect work that God wants praise the Lord that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing either not failing nor fainting in trials that you will not faint in trial so when you are tested right to the very extreme and it goes beyond what you even comprehend that you're able to take back this type of perfection brings you to a spot to where you will not fail in the most heated trial of your life that others without this will look at you and say how in the world can you take that and you say I honestly don't know it must be my god because I'm not able to barring such things I do not have the ability to deal with such thing it is the perfection of my father in my life let's read now in James chapter 1 verse 19 wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath to him that knows to do good and does it not to him it is Santa the ancient philosophers have taken notice that men have two years and one tongue that they should hear more than they speak as also the ears are continually open ever ready to receive instruction while the tongue is surrounded by double row of teeth to hedge it in to keep it within proper bounds some of us should have had four sets of teeth let's lock in Cheney maybe a set of dentures with poly grip on the lips hey man now when James the ride saw this do you think it's just bumping his gums ain't got nothing else to write about no this is something that is beneficial to who the Brethren be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to rap now and what if every one of us sitting here today if we would apply this simple Word of God to our lives and make this an app in our life okay don'tdon't download this on your iPhone or your droid but download this into your life and make this an app that is constantly running in your life that your Swift to hear and so to speak does that mean gossip no sir does him in here say no sir it means sweat to hear that which is good that which is true whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report think on these things swift to hear slow to speak and soda ass you realize after this day it will be sin for you and I it will be sin the same thing as a woman cutting her hair a single thing is a man smoking cigarettes sin first not to apply this to our lives some of y'all wish you hadn't come to church I'm sure now watching verse 22 be doers of the word now many people have a mistaken idea that they feel like by hearing the word they have a compass such a great thing many folks feel that by listening to brother Branham by listening to a pastor by hearing the word by hearing the Bible go on in their cars or hold or reading the Bible that they're doing such a wonderful things they are if they will follow through with the rest of them but hearing is not doing not truly you can't do if you don't hear but if you just hear and don't do you're worse off than the person who don't hear now notice the way James put this but be doers of the word not hearers only now many Christians mark their Bibles they mark message quotes but their Bibles never mark them now it's one thing to take a highlighter and enable to underline and score and all that sort of thing sort of stick out to you but it's another thing entirely for that word to be able to so imprint upon your life that that highlighted portion of the word actually becomes you and you become the highlight then that word oh my that word actually becomes you in practice in everyday life now watch how James looks at this is quite an insight on this but be doers of the word and not hearers only now why deceiving your own selves so you mean a person who hears the word I got time at Dogma so he wouldn't be talking about other folks at others in nomination with churches but it would be folks who are setting under a ministry that's actually hearing bringing the word and they would sit there and hear the word but if they don't apply it there actually deceiving their self Wow how would they do that by convincing their self that hearing enough that doing it is not really that I will doing it is on their part and when they do that they actually deceived their self can you imagine it's not the devil doing it it's not demons how the hell but they are deceiving their self I'm okay that's fine I'll go to church I hear the word brother Don is my pasture brother man was my prophet did you do it no no no no but I hear it I believe it I believe it now what's in the next verse If any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass which is a mirror now once you look at this word natural I found this other day in Illinois when I was sitting steady and I'll tell you it just it just turned me inside out beholding his natural face Genesis the word natural is Genesis and it means generation source origin a book of one's lineage lord have mercy so when you looked into the mirror this morning when you got up you were looking into the book of your life you were seeing your Genesis human flesh mortality that needs help with God so then whenever we look into the meal what do we see what do we see when we look now James says in a man who loosen what he calls a glacier which it was a mirror but when a man looks into the mirror he said a man beholding his Genesis face and which his ancestry or progeny are enraged so when a man looks into the mirror he sees his Genesis so what does he see now there's a great difference between looking in a mirror and looking at a pitch you know what if we took a picture of you 20 years ago and we would take that picture and look you would sit and look at that picture and you look wild worried all them wrinkles come from weird dim gray hairs come from I wouldn't wearing glasses in Washoe was a lot skinnier than man what happened to me you're looking backwards now can you comb your hair by looking at a picture some of y'all could because you ain't gotten here as much as you had 20 years ago you might wish you there could you be able to get dirt off of your face or eggs or ketchup or something like that by looking at a picture of yourself do you have a picture of yourself in front of your sink where you comb your hair and shave your brother's do you have a picture of yourself what do you have a mirror there's one thing about a mirror it won't lie will it you can talk to it all day mirror mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all and the mirror reflects only what you are if you got a big ol ugly nose that Mearing wanna you know prostate surgery oh my it's gonna take this I know the mirror shows what is in front of it and can't you see what a perfect parallel that the Word of God is this is why folks don't like this kind of preaching they want a preacher they don't preach to them from a photograph and sit of a mirror this is why this kind of preaching gets down on all of us where we live why because it helps us to see the way we really really are but I'm gonna tell you one thing today friend I don't want to just see what I am I want to see what I can be I want to look into another glass so the Word of God that points me to what I'm going to be by his grace and the main reason for owning mirrors how many have mirrors in your house your car some of you may have them on your phone I mean you may live what's it for decoration what's it for to look at yourself when you go out when you come to church whatever you want to look is presentable as possible can you imagine before the head mirrors the way everybody's hair must have looked everybody look bad and nobody knew the difference now what's it a thing when James writes this they did not have mirror the way we have today the mirrors were polished metal so they would have vaguely saw an image in this polished metal but it would've been so obscure at least she'd been able to tell you know something wasn't exactly right by holding this piece of polished metal but man has been able to develop more and more precise images with mirror even in the days of the Victorians whenever mirror was their total different process in the way it is today but as he goes on today when we look into the mirror we can see so plainly any blemishes and it falls and he has it's out of the place or whatever more now it was sleek of that in the light of the word in the days of loser in the days of Wesley this saying that it was more like a piece of polished metal or a piece of something that they looked at their self and losers were standing there smoking a pipe but he couldn't see himself in the word that that was wrong and Ingrid German he'd sit there and drink beer but looking in the mirror he couldn't see it but as a come on to Elsa it seemed that the Polish become a little bit broader and into a stage of sanctification and they realize man that part don't look hot in mom back me said you with a bottle of beer don't look on no sir that's not right it went on in the days of Pentecost he got a little more and then in the last days from the seventh angel car and the image of the Lord God revealed by the word became so clear that we look at ourselves now we see ever believe me ever saw don't you say what the words doing can't you say what the word is doing it's bringing us closer to the image in the mirror James mentions several mistakes that people make as they look into God's mirror first of all many of them just merely make a casual glance into the mirror good enough I look great a casual glance into a mirror can leave many imperfections in you can you imagine you coming to church this morning had egg on the side of your face your husband didn't tell you these children didn't tell you and then you go in the bathroom back to her sister you say dear Lord and over here gravy on with our jam over that biscuit down there coffee over here why did you alter what we didn't want to hurt your feelings mom I'd say you'll hurt ursin you get home now you tell me is your pastor if I see a guy on the side of your face spiritually them I see Jam over here and biscuit over and coffee over there do you would you not rather I would tell you then to wait unless you stand before the judgment seat and they'd be all over and then you look at me said brother Donnie why didn't you tell me well I didn't wanna hurt you Zealand many sincere people read their Bible every day I'll read the message every day or listen to a tape every day but it never becomes what God intended for it to be because they are actually taking a casual glance and it's something they just do them it's just part of their life it's something that they do and their conscience would feel terrible if they didn't daily read the scripture and have their daily devotion but actually their conscience should feel terrible because of the way they're doing it because instead of a deep x-ray into the soul that it can permeate all they're doing is a casual reading well the word says praise God thank you Lord Jesus that is so good and many of them have learned enough about the scripture to avoid issues in their lives so Psalms is always a favorite union generally never get in trouble with the genealogies they're generally okay but to really let the mirror of the word do an x-ray scan of your soul you can't just casually glance but you have to look deeply won't you listen to this and James he projects this the second mistake that people make is that they look into the word and then they forget what type of person it was so this person will actually be able to look beyond the casual glance and they're looking to see oh I need to be better I need you I need I need to quit Oh God forgive me Lord Jesus have mercy and then well I'm a work in progress I'm certainly not what I want to be and praise God I'm not what I used to be and all that but then they forget I forget what kind of person James calls these forgetful hearers now what's bad is it's not that they're so overwhelmed and their memory is all taxed out they are willingly forgetful you see if we really look into the mirror of the word and the mirror will show us in reality what we are in the caption of time then it will have an effect on us to where it will make us want to be a better person a different person let me read you this Isaiah said I said 6 and 5 woe is me for I am undone Peter cried depart from me I'm a sinful man O Lord Luke 5:8 job is the most righteous man on earth in his day yet he confessed I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes when a person really sees through a deep x-ray scan of the mirror of the word they'll not walk away conceited self-righteous like the elder brother was ice not but God forgive me god I'm so sorry touched me Lord and helped me to be a better person notice then the third mistake that many make is that they think hearing is doing that by being a part of the word and not take my stand for the word and I believe it with all of my heart and that's equivalent to obeying the word but of course we know that it is not and that you remember that for for many of the denominational type people of course which you know I had the mess do not listen to tapes as we do for many of them reading the word and you know having all these different things that's a great something for them for many message folks it's playing tapes so playing tapes they replace praying with playing tapes they replace many things they should do by playing thanks why because plain tapes is easier it's easier to play at a brother family this pray it's easy to play a tape a brother Brenda needs to love your neighbors face if they don't love you so what do we do we replace many of the doings just by playing the tape and by playing the table is I believe that a man prisoner I believe it and somehow it soothes our conscience so we've looked into the mirror and the mayor says you've got to do this you've got to do this you've got to do that and you've got to do that so what we do is substitute and put on a sermon and when they're all of listen to eight hours of tapes that's good I'm not I'm not against that at all but what about what you should have done that you left undone hmm so the mirror has a ministry and the Ministry the first fold of the mirror mirrors ministry is to show us what we are that's not a photograph so it doesn't show me what I was 26 27 years ago when I first came here to pass through this church it doesn't show me a dark headed young man it doesn't show me some of you that were 27 years younger than what you are today but it shows me what I am with these wrinkles and these hairs it's turning gray and it shows me so when I look into the mirror of the word it won't show me my wishes mirror mirror on the wall it's Donny the greatest preacher of them all mirror mirror on the wall is down the greatest beacon is Jimmy the greatest said oh tell me mirror there I have my plans [Applause] why because it's made to reflect that way and the mirror of the world now denominational mirror will tell you what you want to hear oh that's okay you can't live right God understands why you gave ever up maybe they'll let go these big churches around you today they'll have a mirror preacher set up and he'll make all kinds of excuses for why they can't live right but I'm one of God's true mirrors I'm gonna tell you the truth if it fries your hide your yours can smile like a piece of smoked bacon I want to tell you the truth because I don't want to be lost to myself and if I skirt around the issues God will hold me responsible for your soul and me and you both will be lost all I do tell you I can't make you live right God won't hold me responsible if you don't know that Betty will hold me responsible if I don't tell it notice in Exodus chapter 38 verse 8 Moses is going to make a Laver of brass and they need brass to make it out of and he made the labor of brass and the foot of it of brass of the looking glasses of the women assembling which is simple at the door the tabernacle of the congregation now the mirror of the first stage of the Ministry of the mirror is to be able to show us what we are what we're lacking what our shortcomings are never to pamper us never to move to our delights and our tastes but show us reality but if it left us so with all been a mess women but I don't want to just look and find that one my shortcomings are I want to look again I want to look again into the second stage of the Ministry of the mirror because in that is the stage that I need once I found out what my shortcomings are now many of you are so satisfied coming to church to get preached on you're so happy you're tickled to death praise God I got beat on and equipped on but it's like you don't make no change after the beat you can't wait to wince and I have to get beat on again and then you come back Saturday night your whole life is beaten I don't want to just be beat I want to be able to change I want to be a better person don't you I don't want to just be we've done all that I know I'm a son cuz I'm hooked on all the time well I know I'm a son too but I want to be able to take what the beat is all about and say god help me I don't do that again so the second stage of the ministry of the mirror is restoration now they're going to make this Laver of brass in order for the priests would wash their feet in their hands and then make it out of what mirrors of course the man at this time wasn't as sissified as they are today so the man didn't have mayor's in their pockets the women did which is woman's nature don't want to look pretty but today men want to look pretty pulled a little pretty things so they take this material I remember sunglass but it is brass material polished material and they take this and now it is refocus it is reshaped into what something that is going to provide a holding of the washing fluid of the water where the priests look up and they won't wash their hands and their feet now watch the mirror so the mirror is now reflected in that it not only shows you what you are but the mirror will actually wash you clean and lead you back to restoration I appreciate a man of God that'll tell us the truth but don't just tell me where I'm wrong leading me back to where I came to have peace with God don't just preach to me every service and beat me down but lead me back to peace was gone praise the Lord now whenever the mirror helps you and I to see what we are sees our shortcomings sees our fault and we look at ourselves we can wallow we can become message Catholics and we can wallow in the mirror we can wallow in our sorrow or we can say okay Lord let the second pole of this mirror lead me back to a restoration with peace with God I see I'm not the way I should I see I've not had the peace of God I'm not always had joy in the midst of trials Lord forgive me but I want the mirror to lead me to that place in you praise be to God so the washing of the water is a picture or a mirror of the work then what does it do whenever we see ourselves and look in the mirror then we come back to the cleansing of the blood little children I write unto you that you sin not but if any man sin we have an advocate of the Father which is a perpetuation of course for our sin not for ours only but for the sins of the whole world knowing that after you were initially redeemed you would have to be washed over and over again what is it that tells you and convinces you you need to be washed in the morning you mirror you get up in the mirror and y'all ever have that little stuff in the corner yeah what tears you give to Tamas what tells you you need to wash your face your call your brush your hair spray your toothpaste tell me answer me what is it that tells you you need to wash your face you're a mirror and then the mirror keeps revealing itself so you wash your face and you did where you can see you and you're able to watch them oh man I know a place on my face oh I got a piece of dead skin there and the what it the further you look the more you inspect the more you find home I've got a wrinkle over here ah there's a new word there's the new blemish oh my those this that the other what does it do it's revealing can't you see why it is so important for us to look in the reveal word of this our reflecting the mirror of today we can't spend all of her life looking in the mirror of 1965 well you mean if you was not even born we've got to look right now what's God got all these smiling in the mirror for this day [Applause] watch what nathan does to david we looked at david and bathsheba last night david goes on for many months does not confess his sin make it right before god but the prophet comes in and you know the story well the prophet gives in the parable of the man traveler came through brother brandon tells us that travel was his passions that traveler came through and he took a man's lamb and killed it now what is the prophet doing he's opening up the word david look into this man i want your judgment tell me what should happen that man should recompense them sheep and that man shall die then Nathan says you are the man he pronounced judgment on himself now if he would have laid it out and said David you don't so-and-so oh no he didn't go that way but he went around about it in another way calling upon the righteous part of David to give true justice and judgment and then you imagine when David looks he says oh I've condemned myself by my own judgment but David not only looked in the mirror to find his faults but he peered the second time and the Prophet said after David repented ye shall not surely die Wow the second look into the mirror they didn't bring judgment about restoration to God what if he would have looked I had to sir that I kill me Nisa kill me later no no God and more for him to go aren't you glad we become so judgmental and so hard about other people if we only realize the same judgment we meet out will be given to us how many times have we judged people wrong and judge them harshly and if it was not for the grace of God would everyone be in a mess of trouble today but thank God for the mirror that does not leave us in a judgemental state but it'll lead us back to restoration as well you imagine that prophet is he holds that mirror now what do you say oh god I'm so sorry forgive me Lord so Nathan not only use the mirror to show in this false when you use the mirror to restore him if you've lost your joy today let me tell you God don't want you to keep it lost let me open the mirror of the word and show you what she used to be you can be that way again you used to have peace in your heart you look at yourself today and you think oh my I used to be so happy I you say well let's not stay there let's not look at that old photo a photograph of what you watched 30 years ago but let me take the mirror the word and show you you can be a restored child of God you can be a restored daughter of God ask yourself the question do many of you have the same joy the same burning zeal that you had for God that yet 10 years ago first you become all in the knotless and you don't enjoy going to church you don't enjoy our Lord you know what you need to know you need to look into the mirror you need to look at the mirror and first you've got to say God show me what's wrong with me [Applause] but many of us go to church and when the mirrors preached this is the way we did JimBob okay hey hey Kel Kel this is you Sarah Bert what about you oh no no I don't have to look at them on the back side of this Searcy black we use our pitchfork and talk Sisson over here yesterday I can't believe so-and-so wasn't in church today that sermon would have been straight for they I'm a fan of in there so instead of taking the mirror looking at herself and saying Lord God Who am I the older I get the more I look like my daddy so I look at a picture of him and I look at me what can I do about it it's my Genesis it's the book of my origin this this is the book of my origin but thank God this is my favorite book I am oh you won't you one my husband about my kids no no no when you get up in the morning to look in the mirror do you have you and your husband your kids and your uncles and aunts and your brothers and brother-in-law's and sister-in-laws all y'all Center in front of mirror or are you interested in what you look like a map are you interesting what you look resistant maybe you all can do it I've never yet been able to figure out a way to sleep and turn and toss and get up in the morning look like I've stepped out of a JCPenney catalog unless it was the garbage sacks in the back of the catalog sometimes my hair sticking up on the back and sometimes it's sticking up over here oh I know some of y'all want me to think you're just as Purdy's you are now I know better I don't know better force one the first thing you do and you go to trying to get yourself together praise God why don't we resent them when we come to church when the mirrors constable force when you do this in your life absolutely every day numerous times during the day now depending on what you want to do or depend on how much time you spend in front of the mirror if you're gonna clean the house that day sister you may take your rag and tie it around your head like a bandanna ain't nobody coming I hear you look awfully - mama - my help i rolling my hair but if you find I'm going out then you'll spend more time Gina Lynn from over there then if you're gonna go somewhere else what do you do what is every change of clothes require I look in the mirror don't you understand in order for a change of the body there must be a lot [Applause] this is the third face of the Ministry of a mirror transformation transformation y'all better be happy I looked in the mirror this morning got ready for church go now get up we're all sweaty at last night this side of my head was sticking up this way this side was sticking her that way I look like I'd been the car wreck and I was the car so the mirror told me I needed to wash my hair y'all better be glad it scared you today if you see me mean brother down with something one time up metal knowing it was really really cold 14 15 degrees something like that and I had on two or three different hats stocking caps and this that another oh it got cold outside I was going to the truck so I walked on that's the truck Tex brother Daryl ton sound going on the truck son a little bit he come out when I got in the truck and warmed it up I just reached a prank grab and hold them stocking caps and pulled him straight over my head like that well I noticed when he opened the door he looked kind of strange he told me this past time whenever he's gone he said I'll never forget that that's Martin Lee for life now myself it didn't bother me why cuz I looked in the mirror so I didn't feel strange I didn't know that I looked strange can't you understand why the Laodiceans don't know they look strange to us can't you understand why they don't know they appear strange in the eyes of God their preachers ain't putting a mirror up and [Applause] we're looking in the mirror the word [Applause] daily house we're looking into the mirror the word Paul says this in second Corinthians 3:18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord look at this word beholding beholding as a glass to show in a mirror to make to reflect to mirror to look at oneself in a mirror to behold oneself but we all with open face beholding as in a glass but notice what you see when you take God's mirror you don't see yourself normal but beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord the third face of the mirror is you change but you'll never live to face if you don't come to phase one and Phase two do you look at yourself and then your restore and your constant renewing your fellowship constantly wants for the water the word and the last glimpse into the mirror you look see the glorious Lord [Music] Lord Jesus beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord and our changed the third pole of the mirror is to usher in the change look at this word changed Metamorpho transfigure transform to change into another form so naturally what did you do and you'll get put in the morning you find this on your face and that on your face and your hand it is what do you do about what you see in the mirror you change it to what you want it to be a man children don't get weary of looking in the mirror don't get we're hearing your thoughts preached on but know this the last glimpse in the mirror bring your change this word changed is the same word that would get metamorphosis from you remember by the mm or black brother fly black butterfly by the jewel of horny you're in this cocoon and you're all wrapped up in mortality and humanity but you're gonna come out a beautiful butterfly one day but how you gonna do it you've got to do it to the mirror you can't behold my denomination I'll look into brother man's face that ain't enough I'll look in the pause face has so what we're supposed to look at we're supposed to look into the mirror of the Lord and we'll look and we'll look until the image in that mirror has actually changed into the glory of the Lord or Jesus into the chain notice has changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord so in the third phase of the mirror and the son or daughter of God looks into the mirror to see the last stage and they look and when you rub your cheek Jesus rep sees it's him you remember the little boy that was raised out in the country I'd had never seen a mirror mount he married that he ever had no nerve was his daddy had a piece of a mirror tacked on a tree did he shave back but the little boy wasn't big enough to get up to see himself so I went to his auntie's house in the city and she had a full-length message mirror I mean full-length mirror on the door glory that's what we want any sisters we want a full-length mirror so to show us to progress and ungodly thus if you've only got a mirror that shows from here up you might look holy until that mirror would shine down this way and they said whoa aah some bad Roma I don't know about you I want a full-length mirror praise the Lord I don't want God to give me a mirror just in the head my eyes I'm bill Jim I want a full length mirror that'll show me my faults and my shortcomings there hey man and then I want a mirror that I'll be able to leave me back in the presence of God and then I want to take my last you into that mirror and I will eat myself out of this body into a new body glory to God how I looking [Applause] the little boys looking around the house and all of a sudden he walks about the door he waved his little boy waved a little bit closer little boy right back never remember he'd never seen himself before I pray the Almighty God will lay such a mere open before us today that we'll be able to see ourselves never his mommy and his aunty watching him and the little boy realizes he turns her head says mommy close what do you see would you rather I'd have a photograph of you 10 years ago showing you what a great Christian you are how much joy you had or are you very proud by God's grace of what you see presently do you love him more today than you've ever left him in your life or would you rather I'd have a picture of you up here when I 10 years ago I prayed more I read more I went to church more often now I gotta admit I was a better person I already was huh I didn't I didn't have as much money as much goods but as a better person you'd be better off to be poor you want a picture of yourself but can you look at your real joy would you really hard today look in that mirror yes you did before you come in my hair sticking up side of my head Oh God God ain't got no spiritual makeup to hide your blemishes you won't step again forever but don't set to the rest of the day now and mourn and cry and feel sorry for yourself you let the devil beat you down but let me as your pastor take this mirror and lead you to restoration let me as long as God will give me Grace and strength and if i dying off he'll send another man that will take on follow that Ministry of the word until one day you'll take your last glimpse and you'll look and you see I've been changed spirits merciful God there's no one looking around please I just want you to be real sincere now before the Lord each of us beginning was being let us just take the mirror of his word hold it up in front of us and you don't need to tell me or necessary the person beside you the person you need to be honest with is yourself what do you see do you see a harsh judgmental person you see a person that's like Jesus they're just so much like Jesus people have a hard time differentiating you from Jesus because you're so much lacking or do you see a person that's falling short of many of these things and then do you see a person that doesn't want to stay there but they want to be restored and ultimately changed I'm certainly not at that place yet friends of second Corinthians tour I can look in the mirror and see the image of Jesus but what I'm seeing is the images being changed from glory to glory to glory you see for many folks in the message it's a very confusing time right now great signs wonders miracles we see caught moving among us we see healings and all that but it's not like it was in the days in the 50s and 60s and people are trying to figure out all my we need this we need this your financial no we need a looking glass a looking glass the supernatural leads us to view the image what do you see what do you see when you look keep looking deep enough and your fans are Genesis but Genesis is not the only book in the Bible I want to see my revelation I see my Genesis I know it I know what shortcomings is failures but I also know my apocalypsis my revelation my end John saw me coming with him coming out of heaven on a white horse praise God so I've got to keep looking service after service the day after day I don't just look in the mirror when I come to church every day of my life I look in the mirror lord have I done anything wrong today of a displeased Jim Lord not so much what I've done if I left anything undone forgive me I look in this mirror every day of my life multiple times during the day friend this is not a game to me this is not a living to me this is my life come in like to be remembered today Lord Jesus thank you Father god bless you those of you out stream in the service different parts of the world those of you did get the DVS DVDs right there in your home you listen to a CD driving down the road Australia South Africa wherever you are if you need to be pull over on the side of the road if you're going down through Johannesburg wherever you are let that mirror come right out Lord Jesus each of us today probably not one person at least those that are old enough to know came to this church today without looking in them here our children are raised it with some when the first things they do over morning the brush their teeth they go to the mirror they comb their hair or they start washing their face it's something we do daily multiple times during the day lord help us send to see if we need that in the natural appearance what about the supernatural appearance help us to keep the mayor of your word right before us Lord I know you've spoken to hearts today I've seen you as you've come down in this congregation or God I pray Lord Jesus may they not look at a picture of what there were but they're not try to hold up a memory but may they look at the mirror and be honest am I really what I'm thinking I am am I just hearing the word and deceiving myself by not doing it where they look Lord and then may they not stay if they find faults and failures may they not stay there glassy out as it was peering into that image because it can become heartbreaking but may they look again into the second poll of them Mira's ministry to restore their joy restore their fellowship let us keep looking Lord God until we see you in the mirror praise be to God Lord Jesus the solvers open for any of you they just like to come up and talk to the Lord you can do it right there in your seat if you'd like but if you'd like you can come up here and kneel as well just may the Holy Ghost not with a casual glimpse but with a deep peering looking into the mirror and see what's there maybe not the things that you're doing but for things that you're leaving undone not completed it's eroding your joy your peace what do you see when you look today Happy Valley and remember don't push this off to another church to another people we want to look at us ourselves what do
