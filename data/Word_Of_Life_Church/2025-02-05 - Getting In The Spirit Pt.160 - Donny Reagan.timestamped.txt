[30:52] what he just

[30:57] good
[30:58] good or whatever it was I appreciate
[31:01] brother Daryl I'll say that much um
[31:04] appreciate being here
[31:05] tonight um this song that we're singing
[31:08] is an old one and uh uh basically I've
[31:14] been singing it for a long time and
[31:16] reason why I can't seem to get away from
[31:18] it is has to do with the last verse I
[31:22] come up here for a funeral most of you
[31:25] know uh you know Sister Cheryl passing
[31:28] and but the the thing about this last
[31:31] verse and I'm just going to go ahead and
[31:33] and read
[31:35] it the last verse says and there's a
[31:37] room filled with sad Ashen faces and
[31:41] without hope death has wrapped them in
[31:45] Gloom but at the side of a saint there's
[31:50] rejoicing for life can't be sealed in a
[31:55] tomb and I can't get that out of my mind
[31:57] mind and my heart tonight and and so I
[32:00] want to sing this tonight if you know it
[32:02] sing it with us we haven't practiced it
[32:04] so this is all practice in front of you
[32:06] so let's just worship God together in
[32:08] this and we'll see if we'll do something
[32:10] after this but let's just try this
[32:13] together it was a
[32:16] life filled with
[32:20] aimless
[32:26] desperation where without
[32:30] hope walk the
[32:33] shell of a
[32:38] man then a
[32:42] hand with a nail print stretched
[32:50] downward oh just one
[32:55] touch then a new
[32:58] life
[33:04] be and The
[33:07] Old Rugged
[33:10] Cross made the
[33:14] [Music]
[33:16] difference in a
[33:19] life Bound for
[33:22] heartache and
[33:26] defeat can you say this part now I'm
[33:30] going to praise him
[33:35] forever and
[33:40] ever for the cross
[33:44] made the
[33:47] difference for
[33:51] me oh

[43:24] would be me sitting back there and him
[43:25] be stand up here T not be taking
[43:28] serviceman next time praise the
[43:31] Lord um let's turn to the Book of
[43:33] Proverbs if you would tonight 11: 18
[43:37] Lord Willam we still on tomorrow night I
[43:39] guess brother Joe brother Rob for
[43:40] question and answers all
[43:43] right I told our youth that I was done
[43:46] the last time that I did question
[43:48] answers on on the one question about
[43:51] prophets but I took care one day this
[43:53] week I just could not get it off of my
[43:56] heart and I thought hm so maybe I should
[44:00] look a little more boy what did I find
[44:04] oh my
[44:06] goodness so looking forward to that
[44:08] tomorrow
[44:10] night Proverbs chap 11 we've been
[44:13] speaking about seed for the rain we all
[44:17] believe the Harvest time is certainly
[44:20] closer than it's ever been before do we
[44:22] not but we know that we are not just
[44:25] sewing for down the road you know the
[44:28] latter ring that we're looking about and
[44:31] looking forward is going to be the
[44:33] Rapture the Mount Zion Showdown but
[44:35] while we're going that way there's a lot
[44:38] of seed and a lot of sewing and a lot of
[44:41] harvest that we're going to be doing
[44:44] right now in this
[44:46] life so Proverbs 11 chapter verse 18 the
[44:51] wicked workers a deceitful
[44:55] work but to him him that Seth
[45:00] righteousness shall be for a sure
[45:06] reward the wicked worketh a deceitful
[45:10] work but to him that sth righteousness
[45:15] so if we are righteous and then we live
[45:17] righteous we are sowing righteous seed
[45:20] so to him that Seth righteousness shall
[45:24] be a sure reward word also Galatians
[45:30] 6:7 be not deceived God is Not mocked
[45:35] for whatsoever a man
[45:37] Seth that shall he also reap for he that
[45:42] Seth to his flesh and remember you got
[45:45] two main Gardens your flesh is a garden
[45:49] and then the spirit Capital which is not
[45:51] your human Spirit but the spirit of God
[45:54] is another Garden by which we can sew
[45:56] into
[45:57] he that Seth to his flesh shall of the
[46:00] flesh reap corruption but he that Seth
[46:04] to the spirit capital S shall of the
[46:08] capital S Spirit reap life Everlasting
[46:13] now listen to this quote it's very very
[46:15] simple but very profound and Powerful as
[46:17] well so don't say nothing
[46:21] evil about
[46:23] Christians don't try to
[46:29] harm
[46:31] Christians because you'll
[46:34] reap what you sow every
[46:37] time now can we differ with Christians
[46:40] yes and will we discuss situations that
[46:42] we don't understand among family members
[46:46] and and the family of God members we
[46:48] will but there's a difference in that
[46:51] and trying to harm Christians just
[46:55] remember now don't say nothing evil
[46:58] about Christians don't try to harm
[47:02] Christians because you reap what you SE
[47:05] every time touch not my anointed and do
[47:10] my profits no harm it was far better for
[47:14] you that you'd have a millstone tied at
[47:17] your
[47:18] neck and
[47:20] drowned in the depths of the
[47:23] sea than to offend
[47:27] my
[47:29] anointed I realize we're living in
[47:32] leoa which is people's rights and people
[47:35] are more concerned about their own
[47:36] feelings and their own rights and what
[47:38] they want to do than they are God's word
[47:41] but this is God's law yeah and the
[47:44] church said amen now want you notice
[47:46] that he does not just put the anointed
[47:49] only on
[47:51] preachers preachers are not the only one
[47:54] Anointed The Bride is Anointed Ed to be
[47:58] bride yeah so he don't don't just say
[48:02] don't talk against preachers but don't
[48:04] speak wrong against Christians and try
[48:07] to harm them so don't say nothing about
[48:10] Christians maybe some of them don't live
[48:13] just
[48:15] right or just do right but that's God's
[48:19] child let the father take care of his
[48:23] own kitties
[48:27] don't you love that
[48:30] vernacular let the father take care of
[48:32] his own kitties you know if we go to
[48:35] fighting one
[48:36] another now listen what's going to
[48:38] happen to us so whether it's preachers
[48:40] in the pulpit leoty in the
[48:43] pews when we go to fight one another God
[48:47] give us both a whipping
[48:50] maybe dear Jesus help us
[48:54] Lord help us Lord
[48:57] so let's just leave the other fell alone
[49:01] and pray for him try to love him and
[49:04] correct him and maybe God will help him
[49:10] I wonder what kind of church would' be
[49:13] if we took this one quote tonight just
[49:15] just one simple quote and try to apply
[49:18] this every day to our lives for the rest
[49:22] of our
[49:23] lives amen there'd be people coming from
[49:26] all over the world world trying to see
[49:28] what broke out at Word of Life Church
[49:31] cuz it would be so phenomenal it be so
[49:33] wonderful that the love of God would be
[49:35] so amazing Among Us and the greater his
[49:38] love is the greater his presence is I
[49:41] wonder what we would
[49:43] become well I can just give you a little
[49:46] bit of Prophecy if you want me to yeah
[49:48] this is the type of people that's going
[49:50] in the Rapture remember when he went
[49:52] down on the curtain of time and he said
[49:53] you lay aside everything so that
[49:56] includes everything until you get
[49:58] perfect love then in sort 1965 when he
[50:01] reiterates that story he said I believe
[50:04] the people that go in the Rapture will
[50:06] be something like what I
[50:08] saw before they
[50:11] go so you mean perfect love will be
[50:13] pressing its way so far into this
[50:16] Dimension hell is why shouldn't
[50:21] life hell is pressing itself all around
[50:23] us every day is it not you mean hell's
[50:25] going to do that heaven's not going
[50:26] going to do that I just can't believe
[50:29] that that's the kind of person I want to
[50:31] be can we just pray
[50:35] together Lord Jesus we believe tonight
[50:38] that what we've read is the truth and we
[50:40] thank you already for the service that
[50:43] we've had just for singing and worship
[50:45] and prayer and prayer request and Lord
[50:48] our brother Jeremy blessing our hearts
[50:50] father was with the songs and the talent
[50:52] the anointing that you've given him now
[50:55] father as we come to this p portion of
[50:57] the service the word and we're a needy
[50:59] people we stand here tonight and we're
[51:01] not ashamed to say that we need you we
[51:04] need your help oh how we long to see you
[51:07] moving Among Us your Prophet tells us in
[51:10] perfect faith that we long to see those
[51:13] Apostolic times moving Among Us and he
[51:15] said we see them but we just want to see
[51:18] more of them but father tonight my focus
[51:21] is not just on the apostolic part my
[51:25] focus is if we can get more of your love
[51:27] and more of your nature and more of your
[51:30] character I just believe all those other
[51:32] things will follow right in line as we
[51:34] have need of but if we focus more on the
[51:37] sideline and if we try to Major on
[51:39] minors instead of minoring on majors and
[51:42] putting it all out of the circumference
[51:44] of where you put it no telling what will
[51:46] make a mess out of it all we need your
[51:49] help tonight father speak to us your
[51:51] great word would you Lord shut my mouth
[51:54] to anything that would displease you
[51:56] father I pray in the name of the Lord
[51:58] Jesus amen God bless you
[52:01] Saints I trust that you all are getting
[52:04] a whole lot more seeds to be able to sew
[52:06] in your garden from these services from
[52:09] the text and the WhatsApp the emails the
[52:12] phone calls and um all the feedback that
[52:15] I've been getting from these Services
[52:17] apparently they're very very needy and
[52:20] uh I'd like to say and thank the Lord
[52:22] tonight for the testimonies that I've
[52:24] been hearing uh not only from our church
[52:26] but from other people who string the
[52:28] service that the Lord has delivered I
[52:31] don't know how many people of
[52:33] unforgiving spirits and all different
[52:35] types of things that God has already
[52:38] done I believe tonight will be no less
[52:40] of a miraculous visitation from God read
[52:43] with me if you would to 1 Peter chap 3:8
[52:46] finally be ye all of One mind now do you
[52:53] believe that that is possible yes
[52:57] y'all believe that's possible God would
[52:58] have never anointed his man's servant to
[53:01] write that in the scripture had it not
[53:03] be possible now will that be of one
[53:05] human mind no it will not be Carol and I
[53:09] are born on the same day uh I was born
[53:12] that morning she's born later that
[53:13] afternoon so we have the same pattern in
[53:17] the stars that we're so much alike we
[53:20] think alike our tastes are very very
[53:22] similar we like a lot of things but yet
[53:25] there's other things that we differ on
[53:27] as far as day is from night that woman
[53:29] could eat broccoli till the cows come
[53:31] home if I never even look at another
[53:35] piece of broccoli I'm good for the rest
[53:37] of my life she's constantly trying to
[53:40] get me to eat more greens and I tell her
[53:43] look honey I I'm eating from the trees
[53:46] chocolate comes from the Cocoa Tree so
[53:49] I'm more of a tree guy instead of you
[53:52] know and we realize as far as humanly we
[53:55] will never and I'm afraid that Satan has
[53:58] tried to bring us to that spot thinking
[54:00] Lord in Mercy the bride will never get
[54:03] together how could you even think such a
[54:05] thought the bride will be together now
[54:09] it may not be together in the way that
[54:11] you're thinking or the way that I'm
[54:13] thinking it will never be of one human
[54:16] mind we will always differ one from the
[54:19] other but there is a mind a persuasion
[54:23] that which God will be able to
[54:25] accomplish and I love the way the
[54:27] prophet says it and souls it in prison
[54:29] now now the mind that was in Christ
[54:32] Jesus is in every believer there is the
[54:38] soul there is the soul now the mind that
[54:43] was in Christ Jesus is in every believer
[54:47] there is the soul there is where we will
[54:51] be in one mind now watch Peter says be
[54:54] you all of One mind having
[54:57] compassion one of another now we've been
[55:00] looking at the virtues is what also that
[55:04] Peter wrote about and remember these
[55:06] things are not something that we put on
[55:09] and the prophet uses the little simple
[55:11] illustration about a black bird trying
[55:13] to take peacock feathers and stick them
[55:16] in his cell and say see there I'm a
[55:18] peacock and he said why he's only a
[55:21] hypocrite that's all he is and he's
[55:23] trying to illustrate to us how important
[55:25] it is for us to have these things but we
[55:27] cannot get them on our own accord or our
[55:30] own ability so what are these These are
[55:33] attributes of the Lord Jesus himself so
[55:36] when the blood cell was broke open
[55:37] released the very nature of God it
[55:40] allowed it to come back inside of us so
[55:43] it will not be my Fai my virtue my
[55:45] knowledge my Temperance my joy my peace
[55:48] so on and so on but it will actually be
[55:51] his living out of you and I now one
[55:55] thing that we notice the Lord Jesus that
[55:57] was so different from the scribes and
[55:59] the Pharisees the scen and rodians and
[56:01] all them of that day was that the the
[56:03] four writers of the Gospel they noted
[56:07] that there was something about him that
[56:08] was really noticeably different and that
[56:11] was that Jesus had compassion upon the
[56:16] multitudes but now remember the ases the
[56:19] herodians the Sadducees the Pharisees
[56:22] they would not even allow the common
[56:24] people to touch them so they would go
[56:27] out in the marketplaces and they were
[56:28] just you know this holier than thou
[56:31] saying so before they would eat lunch
[56:34] they would go home and wash their hands
[56:37] beginning at the tips of their fingers
[56:39] come up to their elbows some of them
[56:41] would roll their garments up and come
[56:43] pum up to the armpits well if I was
[56:45] going that far I'd go ahead and go my
[56:46] face when you I mean just do it all but
[56:49] they they because maybe they had touched
[56:52] some of the lower class Jews while they
[56:55] were out so they would not put food in
[56:58] their mouths L some of the uh you know
[57:01] whatever that they had touched on the
[57:03] common people had got on them so you
[57:06] imagine then whenever Jesus would allow
[57:09] a woman which had an issue of blood
[57:12] which according to the levitical law
[57:15] anyone who even sat where a person sat
[57:19] on a couch where that person was was
[57:22] contaminated for several days you can
[57:25] imagine then when they saw this woman
[57:28] with this issue of blood coming out of
[57:30] her body and she went up and touched the
[57:33] Garment of the Lord Jesus automatically
[57:36] their minds was this man is unclean he
[57:39] is filthy he has been touched someone
[57:43] with Leprosy are you kidding me people
[57:46] with all types of diseases and
[57:49] sicknesses and they touched them and if
[57:51] they didn't touch him he would touch
[57:54] them which made it even more oh my
[57:57] goodness you've got to be kidding he
[57:59] actually went over and touched people
[58:02] with Leprosy he touched them with all
[58:04] types of plaguy and diseases he would
[58:07] lay his hands on them so there was
[58:10] something so much more different about
[58:13] him than just being sinless it was
[58:17] notably the aspect of God which was
[58:22] compassion now if we are truly bride we
[58:26] are also going to be
[58:30] compassionate so it's not now that we're
[58:32] going to do it from our heart or mind
[58:34] rather and we say oh yeah I have passion
[58:37] on people and I understand yeah I feel
[58:39] sorry for people no that's not it the
[58:41] Lord Jesus was willing to be touched by
[58:45] the unclean and I don't mind telling you
[58:47] that there is a reproach around this
[58:49] message of even trying to identify with
[58:52] people that have backl especially if
[58:54] it's a preacher or if it's somebody
[58:56] that's gotten in sin and got in trouble
[58:58] it's amazing how many people don't want
[59:00] to help them they don't want to get
[59:02] their hands dirty they don't want Oh you
[59:04] mean somebody might find out that I was
[59:06] there Jesus reputation was made known
[59:10] among the prostitutes and the foul and
[59:13] the unclean I ain't talking about
[59:14] rubbing shoulders with them and living
[59:16] the way they live I'm talking about them
[59:18] needing help and trying to find somebody
[59:21] that'll be willing to do it for you do
[59:23] we want to be that way notice he said
[59:26] finally be all of One mind having
[59:28] compassion now remember when we are
[59:30] living this out by the very nature of
[59:33] God in us we are planting the seeds
[59:36] which will turn right around and
[59:37] multiply to us again having compassion
[59:42] one of another love as Brethren be
[59:47] pitiful be pitiful what watch that means
[59:50] is to have pity on one another and even
[59:55] be Cur courteous wow I mean this is
[59:58] really deep stuff right I know this is
[1:00:00] not Thunders and it's not perusia it's
[1:00:02] all that sort of thing and it's
[1:00:04] something that we're not going to hear
[1:00:05] preach very often but it's still in the
[1:00:07] pages of God's word notice what the word
[1:00:10] compassion means suffering or feeling
[1:00:14] the like with another sympathetic so
[1:00:19] they notice Jesus that when he would get
[1:00:21] among the people that he wouldn't stand
[1:00:24] offish like the priest and the Pharisees
[1:00:26] and them you know that they would stand
[1:00:28] off and and the people knew better than
[1:00:30] to touch them they knew better than to
[1:00:33] get around them so they had this holy
[1:00:36] type of thing around them but there must
[1:00:38] have been something about the Lord Jesus
[1:00:41] this or of the supernatural that
[1:00:44] pulsated a welcoming atmosphere because
[1:00:48] these people had been raised up around
[1:00:50] priests and they called him a rabbi too
[1:00:52] and they must have known you don't touch
[1:00:54] a rabbi you do not get near them holy
[1:00:58] righteous men but there must have been
[1:01:01] something projected by him that was
[1:01:04] inviting to the ungodly that was
[1:01:07] inviting to those who would have plagues
[1:01:10] and have all kinds of things and they
[1:01:13] just felt a drawing oh don't you want to
[1:01:16] be that kind of child of God that people
[1:01:18] even though they may smoke and drink and
[1:01:21] run around and whatever but yet they
[1:01:23] know if they have a need they've got
[1:01:26] confidence and God don't want it just to
[1:01:28] be in the preachers God wants it to be
[1:01:30] in our body in our local assembly that
[1:01:33] they might feel a little bit ashamed of
[1:01:35] the way they look and maybe a little bit
[1:01:37] of the way they dress but they feel like
[1:01:40] you will not criticize them that you'll
[1:01:43] do what you can to help them and the
[1:01:45] church said amen having compassion one
[1:01:49] of another love as Brethren be
[1:01:54] pitiful be courteous now let's read some
[1:01:58] examples about our Master Matthew
[1:02:01] 9:36 but when he saw the
[1:02:05] multitudes he was
[1:02:07] moved with
[1:02:10] compassion on them notice now nothing
[1:02:15] about what he could get out of the
[1:02:18] multitude so when he saw the multitude
[1:02:21] he was not moved with pride so that he
[1:02:24] could speak to them
[1:02:26] and give a big report that I spoke to
[1:02:29] the largest congregation that any man
[1:02:31] has ever preached to so when he saw the
[1:02:34] crowd it wasn't that something about
[1:02:37] himself was arrogantly waiting till he
[1:02:39] could go back and tell his disciples uh
[1:02:42] that I I spoke to so many today the
[1:02:44] largest crowd that's ever been known to
[1:02:46] the to a preacher to ever preached and I
[1:02:48] I spoke to him that wasn't what moved
[1:02:50] him it was compassion so it wasn't a big
[1:02:55] number it wasn't the following but what
[1:02:58] dominated his life was compassion so
[1:03:02] when he saw the
[1:03:04] multitudes now not one multitude but
[1:03:08] multitudes in plural and this is what
[1:03:12] his reaction
[1:03:13] was
[1:03:15] compassion so when you and I go into
[1:03:18] Walmart Kroger Food City Mall wherever
[1:03:21] it is we see men dressing in this day
[1:03:25] looking like women we see women looking
[1:03:28] like men anymore you don't know what
[1:03:30] they are you know you want to be
[1:03:33] courious and kind and say yes sir and
[1:03:35] yes ma'am but you don't know if you
[1:03:37] ought to or not
[1:03:38] anymore I was told not long ago one of
[1:03:41] our brothers here once in one of these
[1:03:42] drink places around you where you drive
[1:03:44] to and get a drink and they thanked the
[1:03:47] man and the man let him know that was
[1:03:50] not his
[1:03:52] pronoun so he did not want to be
[1:03:54] identified as a man so you don't know
[1:03:57] what to do so whenever we look at them
[1:04:01] what goes through our mind do we look at
[1:04:03] them with pity and compassion or do we
[1:04:08] automatically you pervert you're going
[1:04:11] to hell you rotten sorry thing but what
[1:04:14] if that pervert as You' call him is
[1:04:18] holding the life predestinated seed in
[1:04:22] the Tri City
[1:04:24] area what if that prostitute dressed
[1:04:27] woman that's that looks absolutely
[1:04:29] horrible but what if she's the next
[1:04:32] woman at the
[1:04:33] well oh my listen children we don't know
[1:04:37] we don't know my look at some of us how
[1:04:40] we were before God got a hold of us
[1:04:42] would we have ever looked like bride
[1:04:44] ain't no way would we have ever looked
[1:04:47] like what we are today no and it might
[1:04:49] be the same way today they may not come
[1:04:52] from an Apostolic church or a Baptist
[1:04:55] Church they may come straight off the
[1:04:56] street it might be a man that's wanted
[1:04:59] to be a woman for half of his life well
[1:05:02] will we welcome a Word of Life cast that
[1:05:04] devil out of them yes we'll do that
[1:05:06] first but will we welcome them and can
[1:05:09] we say come brother you believe whatever
[1:05:11] you want to believe I believe before
[1:05:13] this bride leaves this world there will
[1:05:15] not be one devil not one devil that will
[1:05:20] be conquered by somebody in this bride
[1:05:23] around the world somebody is going to

[1:05:39] pride and arrogance and selfishness and
[1:05:41] so on and so on you mean you believe
[1:05:43] God's going to take a bride and say
[1:05:45] every Devil's subject to her and
[1:05:47] thousands of devils not conquered n that
[1:05:50] ain't my God my God is a mighty
[1:05:52] conqueror and the life stand of Victory
[1:05:55] will be where it was not at Calvary Paul
[1:05:58] even said it so emphatically that in
[1:06:01] that day when the resurrection of the
[1:06:02] Saints takes place then we'll be brought
[1:06:05] to pass the saying death is swallowed up
[1:06:08] in Victory how come they didn't say that
[1:06:10] when Jesus raised from the dead
[1:06:13] Hallelujah because he wanted that to be
[1:06:16] consummated in Bride form Not only would
[1:06:20] deaths be conquered by the bride but all
[1:06:23] these other evils in this age are going
[1:06:26] to be conquered somebody's going to
[1:06:28] conquer Alzheimer's somebody's going to
[1:06:31] conquer lung cancer come on Sheldon
[1:06:33] somebody's going to conquer absolutely
[1:06:36] conquer blindness and deafness and
[1:06:39] legs yes sir I believe there
[1:06:42] will be missing limbs that will be
[1:06:45] restored before the bride goes
[1:06:51] home
[1:06:53] Hallelujah but you know what it's going
[1:06:55] to take for the body Hallelujah
[1:06:58] compassion yes sir
[1:07:03] compassion notice when he saw the
[1:07:05] multitudes he was moved with compassion
[1:07:08] on them notice
[1:07:11] why because they
[1:07:14] fainted and were scattered
[1:07:17] abroad having a
[1:07:20] sheep having no
[1:07:23] Shepherd so instead of condemning and he
[1:07:26] could
[1:07:27] have instead of judging them and being
[1:07:30] harsh instead he looked at him and
[1:07:32] thought poor
[1:07:34] things they faint they're scattered they
[1:07:37] don't know what's right they're going
[1:07:40] from church to church Pillar To Post I
[1:07:42] don't know what to
[1:07:44] do oh
[1:07:47] hallelujah
[1:07:48] hallelujah Matthew 14:14 and Jesus went
[1:07:52] forth and saw a great multitude
[1:07:57] and was
[1:07:58] moved with compassion toward them and
[1:08:04] healed they're
[1:08:07] sick chapter
[1:08:10] 15:32 then Jesus called his disciples un
[1:08:13] to him and said I have
[1:08:17] compassion on the
[1:08:19] multitude because they continue with me
[1:08:22] now three days and have nothing to eat I
[1:08:26] will
[1:08:27] not send them away
[1:08:31] fasting lest they faint in the way now
[1:08:35] watch so in in chapter nine it's because
[1:08:39] they have no sh no Shepherd they're
[1:08:42] scattered he has compassion in chapter
[1:08:45] 14 he was moved with compassion because
[1:08:48] he needed healing in their body in
[1:08:51] chapter 15 he expresses compassion
[1:08:54] because the have material
[1:08:57] needs they were hungry naturally but if
[1:09:01] you notice Jesus didn't just say now all
[1:09:03] of you that believe I'm the Messiah you
[1:09:06] all get on one side and all the rest of
[1:09:09] you bunch of devils get on the other
[1:09:11] side and I am going to feed my
[1:09:17] followers Jesus didn't even divide him
[1:09:20] as far as belief and unbelief but he had
[1:09:24] compassion thank you Lord on the flood
[1:09:28] victims yes
[1:09:30] sir you understand what I'm saying you
[1:09:33] see friends what happens because of the
[1:09:35] type of message that we have we so
[1:09:39] narrow everything down we bring it down
[1:09:42] smaller smaller smaller I understand
[1:09:45] that concept I understand that principle
[1:09:48] but the danger is if we're not careful
[1:09:51] we'll narrow down love we'll narrow down
[1:09:54] Mercy will narrow down kindness
[1:09:57] compassion what's wrong with trying to
[1:10:00] say a kind word to these people out here
[1:10:03] it may be the only kind word some of
[1:10:05] them hear all day long I'd rather be
[1:10:08] kind to everybody what brother done what
[1:10:10] if they don't believe the message well
[1:10:12] what if they don't I don't see the Lord
[1:10:14] Jesus sorting them out and say all right
[1:10:16] all of you that believe the message come
[1:10:17] over here and I'll heal you he heals him
[1:10:20] he heals him praise the Lord but you see
[1:10:24] whenever we go to naring get down naring
[1:10:26] it down if we're not careful we get to a
[1:10:28] spot it becomes Only The Selective few
[1:10:31] that we like it ought to be something in
[1:10:33] us if we saw a rank sinner that was sick
[1:10:36] and the spirit of God moved on our heart
[1:10:39] I've done it before and I've told you of
[1:10:40] examples and Sams and Walmart and other
[1:10:43] places and I'm going to continue to do
[1:10:45] so they may never come to this church
[1:10:47] that don't make no difference I want to
[1:10:49] be like Jesus I see Jesus Healing The
[1:10:53] Sick that didn't even believe him I see
[1:10:55] Jesus reaching out a hand to help people
[1:10:58] of those that he knew would
[1:11:02] crucify make me more like
[1:11:06] Jesus oh
[1:11:08] my help us Lord chapter 18 verse 21 then
[1:11:13] came Peter to him and said Lord how
[1:11:17] of shall my brother sin against
[1:11:21] me and I forgive him a man I'm tell
[1:11:25] telling you Peter stretching this limit
[1:11:28] wow I mean he's thinking I'm so much
[1:11:31] like Jesus I'm a preacher and I I cast
[1:11:34] out Devils I'm telling you what I'm a
[1:11:36] man of God I'm going to reach out here
[1:11:40] Beyond myself I I'm going to say I'm
[1:11:43] going to say till seven
[1:11:47] times yeah what do you think of that
[1:11:53] Lord this is what Jesus
[1:11:56] thought Jesus said unto him I say unto
[1:12:01] thee until seven
[1:12:03] times but until 70 times
[1:12:09] 7 therefore is the kingdom of heaven
[1:12:12] like unto a certain King which would
[1:12:15] take account of his servants and when he
[1:12:19] begun to reckon one was brought unto him
[1:12:22] which owed him 10,000
[1:12:27] talents now according to the price of
[1:12:29] the troy ounce of silver which is what
[1:12:33] this was the price will vary
[1:12:37] somewhat but one of the prices that I
[1:12:39] found last week in studying this was
[1:12:42] this amount
[1:12:46] 226 million
[1:12:52] 291,000 $72
[1:12:57] and 50
[1:13:03] CS so this is what this man owed his
[1:13:06] Lord or his master for as much as he had
[1:13:10] not to pay his Lord commanded him to be
[1:13:13] sold and his wife and children and all
[1:13:17] that he had and payment to be
[1:13:20] made the servant there therefore fell
[1:13:23] down and worshiped him saying Lord have
[1:13:27] patience with me and I will pay the all
[1:13:31] which is totally
[1:13:34] impossible then the Lord of that servant
[1:13:37] was moved
[1:13:42] with
[1:13:44] compassion I want you to listen to these
[1:13:46] words
[1:13:47] carefully and
[1:13:50] loosed him right and forgave him the
[1:13:57] debt look at the word
[1:13:59] loosed release set at Liberty let depart
[1:14:05] set free to detain no
[1:14:08] longer to let go
[1:14:11] free to acquit one accused of a
[1:14:15] crime and set him at
[1:14:18] Liberty so he owes
[1:14:21] $226 million
[1:14:25] and this master
[1:14:27] says you're
[1:14:30] free now notice he didn't go by the
[1:14:32] Avenue of wisdom of knowledge of
[1:14:35] shouting of gifts all them had their
[1:14:37] places now but what attribute was it
[1:14:40] that moved on the
[1:14:42] master
[1:14:45] compassion
[1:14:47] compassion but this man in the parable
[1:14:50] had
[1:14:51] experienced
[1:14:53] compassion but did didn't have any
[1:14:59] himself he experienced great
[1:15:04] forgiveness but didn't have any
[1:15:07] himself now watch so Jesus in his Cho
[1:15:10] choice of words it's amazing to me so he
[1:15:13] loosed him and forgave him now the first
[1:15:17] word would have been powerful enough but
[1:15:18] then Jesus uses another word to let go
[1:15:21] to
[1:15:23] disregard not to
[1:15:27] discuss so you're not only loose from
[1:15:30] this you and I will never mention this
[1:15:36] again when you get around me don't even
[1:15:38] bring it back up again oh I'm I'm so
[1:15:40] thankful you forgive me I'm so thankful
[1:15:42] I'm don't no no it is taken care of to
[1:15:45] such a degree we will never talk about
[1:15:48] this again now keep this in
[1:15:51] mind what this man received but he he
[1:15:55] himself is fixing to
[1:15:59] reverse being
[1:16:01] loosed and being
[1:16:06] forgiven well y'all listening good
[1:16:09] tonight they always tell me is a good
[1:16:11] time to sew seed when the wind wasn't
[1:16:18] blowing then the Lord of that servant
[1:16:20] was moved with
[1:16:22] compassion and loosed him and forgave
[1:16:24] gave him the debt but the same servant
[1:16:29] went out and found one of his fellow
[1:16:33] servants who owed him 100
[1:16:37] P which is
[1:16:45] 17 $17 compared to
[1:16:49] $226
[1:16:52] m291 72
[1:16:59] 50 so this man owes him 100
[1:17:02] p and he laid hands on
[1:17:09] him now look at the difference in this
[1:17:12] servant and the master the the the Bible
[1:17:15] Jesus in giving the parable does not say
[1:17:18] that the Lord this King laid hands on
[1:17:21] this man that owed him millions of
[1:17:23] dollars now this is Express ex of
[1:17:25] intense
[1:17:27] anger so he laid hands on him and took
[1:17:32] him by the
[1:17:36] throat I mean this
[1:17:38] guy is in a mess
[1:17:42] Ain now you would agree with me that
[1:17:45] this man
[1:17:46] experienced
[1:17:48] forgiveness this man experienced
[1:17:52] compassion this man experienced being
[1:17:54] being loosed from a terrible terrible
[1:17:59] debt but he did not know how to do the
[1:18:02] same
[1:18:03] thing for a man who owed him
[1:18:12] $17 now remember Jesus is setting this
[1:18:15] forth in a parable so it's a story
[1:18:18] Parable is a Earthly story with a
[1:18:20] Heavenly
[1:18:21] meaning so this is like the kingdom of
[1:18:24] heaven so in the Kingdom of Heaven going
[1:18:25] to be all kinds of people like this so
[1:18:29] this man now
[1:18:32] is released and
[1:18:35] loosed and boy he's so glad for himself
[1:18:39] but he is so harsh and so judgmental now
[1:18:43] watch the king is almighty God of course
[1:18:47] in the
[1:18:48] parable and then the man that owed the
[1:18:51] millions of
[1:18:52] dollars will call him
[1:18:55] Donnie Paul Daryl Jeremy
[1:18:59] Scott Carol Barbara Linda you you you
[1:19:04] and
[1:19:05] you Jesus is trying to get us to see our
[1:19:09] indebtedness to God was so
[1:19:13] tremendous there's no way we could ever
[1:19:15] settle
[1:19:18] it so he forgave
[1:19:21] us oh my and then he turn goes out and
[1:19:25] sees this friend of his and he took him
[1:19:28] by the throat saying pay me that thou
[1:19:32] owest and his fellow servant fell down
[1:19:36] at his feet and besought him now notice
[1:19:40] he's saying some of the exact same
[1:19:42] things that he
[1:19:44] said so it wasn't that he was saying
[1:19:47] weird bizarre things that was off the
[1:19:51] pattern you see Jesus said this exactly
[1:19:54] on on purpose he sure knows how to say
[1:19:57] stuff don't he so he's saying the right
[1:20:00] things and got the right approach and no
[1:20:02] doubt has an element of sincerity
[1:20:04] because apparently to this man $17 was a
[1:20:08] tremendous
[1:20:10] amount and he besought him saying have
[1:20:13] patience with me and I will pay thee all
[1:20:17] and he would
[1:20:20] not but went and cast him into prison
[1:20:25] is till he should pay the debt now
[1:20:29] somebody please explain to me you're
[1:20:32] going to put a man in prison because he
[1:20:34] owes you so much money tell me how's he
[1:20:36] going to work in prison and pay you
[1:20:39] off I mean I realize I'm d a c bucket if
[1:20:42] you're smarter than this cold bucket C
[1:20:44] bucket go ahead and tell me what you
[1:20:45] know it don't make any sense to me but I
[1:20:49] want you to notice the terms as Jesus
[1:20:51] goes on and he said so when his fellow
[1:20:53] servants saw what was done they were
[1:20:56] very
[1:20:58] sorry and came and told unto their lord
[1:21:01] all that was
[1:21:03] done then after then his Lord after he
[1:21:07] had called him said unto him oh thou
[1:21:13] Wicked
[1:21:16] servant
[1:21:19] uhoh so even after being loosed
[1:21:25] and being forgiven of the former
[1:21:28] debt he has now accumulated
[1:21:32] apparently this tremendous
[1:21:36] debt another
[1:21:38] debt but this time it was against one
[1:21:41] less fortunate than
[1:21:47] himself dear God speak to us
[1:21:51] tonight oh thou Wicked servant I forgave
[1:21:55] thee all that debt because thou desirest
[1:21:59] me that was the only reason I forgive it
[1:22:01] because you wanted me to and had
[1:22:03] compassion on you should us not thou
[1:22:06] also have
[1:22:13] had
[1:22:15] compassion on thy fellow servant even as
[1:22:19] I had pity on thee so you mean the Lord
[1:22:22] Jesus wants us as his forgiven people to
[1:22:28] be able to forgive those who trespass
[1:22:30] against us now remember this whole
[1:22:32] Parable is an answer to this preacher's
[1:22:37] question I like to emphasize that this
[1:22:39] is a preacher it shows you they're not
[1:22:41] perfect either amen so this whole
[1:22:44] Parable and story was an answer to this
[1:22:47] preacher's question about
[1:22:50] forgiveness now I want you to notice how
[1:22:53] strange
[1:22:55] and his Lord was
[1:22:57] Ross and delivered
[1:23:01] him to the
[1:23:03] tormentors now how is this
[1:23:07] possible his debt was
[1:23:12] clean now the word that Jesus uses here
[1:23:16] you see there was two categories of
[1:23:19] crimes of things that we're talking
[1:23:22] about so to be able to grab that Man by
[1:23:25] the throat in some countries would be
[1:23:27] assault but they did normally did not
[1:23:30] turn a deor over to the tormentors now
[1:23:34] the tormentors were people in the
[1:23:36] criminal prisons and they would beat
[1:23:38] criminals uh they would keep food from
[1:23:41] them talk to them really really bad and
[1:23:43] really really treat them bad because
[1:23:45] they were a criminal but a debtor's
[1:23:48] prison was simply for people who didn't
[1:23:51] pay their
[1:23:52] debts so normally it was not normal for
[1:23:56] them to be
[1:23:58] tormented but you see this man after
[1:24:01] receiving forgiveness and not having
[1:24:03] really understood it even his own
[1:24:07] torment was
[1:24:08] changed from a Dead's
[1:24:11] prison to a
[1:24:13] criminal's
[1:24:16] prison because he had
[1:24:19] experienced such
[1:24:22] forgiveness and such Mercy Mery and such
[1:24:26] compassion and he was forgiven
[1:24:30] Millions hundreds of millions of
[1:24:34] dollars and yet he did not have
[1:24:38] $17 worths of Mercy
[1:24:43] oh so by
[1:24:45] law if this man's debt
[1:24:48] was
[1:24:50] eliminated so he was loosed and forgiv
[1:24:55] gave how could this man ever by the
[1:24:57] court of law ever bring this man back in
[1:25:01] brother Jeremy and say send him to
[1:25:03] prison why well he owes me well but but
[1:25:06] but sir you you forgave him here we have
[1:25:10] many witnesses that heard you say that
[1:25:13] you forgive
[1:25:16] him children look what being
[1:25:20] uncaring and
[1:25:22] cold and not min ministering
[1:25:25] compassion look how the Lord looks at
[1:25:28] it did the Lord forgive him did the Lord
[1:25:33] loose him well how is this man going to
[1:25:36] go to prison then how is he going to the
[1:25:40] tormentors and they are going to torment
[1:25:43] this
[1:25:46] man because he had no
[1:25:50] compassion on fellow human beings wow
[1:25:55] you see the big debt was from a fallen
[1:25:58] sinner to a mighty God which could never
[1:26:01] be paid by any mortal but the other debt
[1:26:05] was from one mortal to another mortal
[1:26:08] one flawed human being dealing with
[1:26:11] another flawed human being but the
[1:26:14] evaluation that they placed upon thems
[1:26:17] and upon that other human being was so
[1:26:22] different and by simply that one
[1:26:26] deed it was going to get this individual
[1:26:29] thrown into
[1:26:38] torment makes me want to be kind to
[1:26:42] everybody if I'm guilty okay if I'm
[1:26:46] guilty let me be guilty of loving people
[1:26:50] that'll never be bright just let me be
[1:26:53] guilty of offering a smile to somebody
[1:26:56] that may never even walk down the
[1:26:58] streets of God let me be guilty of
[1:27:00] reaching out my hand to help others
[1:27:03] anybody with me tonight you know what
[1:27:05] because I've tapped into a source that
[1:27:08] there's no end to his love and mercy and
[1:27:11] compassion so it ain't like that I've
[1:27:13] got this little teeny bit of goodness
[1:27:16] and mercy and man I've got to be a
[1:27:18] scrooge you know I've got to just D it
[1:27:20] out just a little bit here I'm I'm
[1:27:21] afraid I'm want to run out what if all
[1:27:23] I've got is my own I will run out but if
[1:27:26] I've tapped into eternal life there's no
[1:27:28] end to it oh my the more I give out the
[1:27:31] more he'll put in me to give out and the
[1:27:34] more we love I believe the more love
[1:27:36] he'll pour in us to love out look at our
[1:27:39] Master we got so many of our brothers
[1:27:41] that want to be like Jesus but why is it
[1:27:44] they always relate to signs and wonders
[1:27:47] and miracles when we're talking about
[1:27:49] being like Jesus right ain't there no
[1:27:52] preachers in this message that wants to
[1:27:54] to be like this like
[1:27:57] Jesus yes sir is all we one of Jesus the
[1:28:00] miraculous and the supernatural Don't We
[1:28:03] Want to Love Like Jesus don't we want to
[1:28:06] try to help the people that's in such
[1:28:09] need if there was I believe with all in
[1:28:11] our heart if Jesus was here on the earth
[1:28:13] in this time frame he would be reaching
[1:28:15] out exactly the same way he did whenever
[1:28:18] he was here before well he ain't here
[1:28:20] but I am he ain't here but you are
[1:28:24] let them know there is a risen
[1:28:30] savior hallu oh
[1:28:33] my and his Lord was
[1:28:37] Ross and delivered him to the
[1:28:41] tormentors till he should pay all that
[1:28:44] was
[1:28:46] due unto
[1:28:49] him oh my now listen Jesus still going
[1:28:53] on with the parable so likewise shall my
[1:28:55] heavenly
[1:28:57] father do also unto
[1:29:00] you now remember this still is an answer
[1:29:03] to Peter's
[1:29:04] questions if ye from your
[1:29:09] hearts forgive not all your special
[1:29:12] friends and all your close family and
[1:29:15] all of those that you really really
[1:29:18] like that's our modern day version ain't
[1:29:22] it from your heart
[1:29:24] forgive not everyone his
[1:29:28] brother their
[1:29:30] trespasses and Word of Life Church
[1:29:33] said and then Word of Life Church also
[1:29:36] said help me Lord help me Lord to be
[1:29:39] more like you I'm not interested in
[1:29:41] Walking On Water friends I have no need
[1:29:43] of walking on water in this day and age
[1:29:45] I have no need of doing some of the
[1:29:47] things that Jesus did I have no need of
[1:29:49] doing some of the things that Moses did
[1:29:51] most of us can afford to buy groceries I
[1:29:53] don't need to pray that God will ring
[1:29:54] quail and bread out of Heaven if we
[1:29:56] needed that I'd have enough Faith to be
[1:29:58] able to do it I believe God would do it
[1:29:59] don't you yes I do if we're out of
[1:30:01] gasoline I believe we could pour uh
[1:30:03] water in our tank I mean you know
[1:30:05] brother walls brother Mike Wall's
[1:30:07] grandfather that happened to him years
[1:30:08] and years ago he was scheduled to go
[1:30:10] preach a meeting and didn't have gas to
[1:30:11] put in his car so they poured water in
[1:30:13] the gas tank and prayed over it and God
[1:30:15] turned it into into gas if he could turn
[1:30:17] water into whne and turn water into
[1:30:19] gasoline well come on plus you don't
[1:30:21] have to pay federal Exile tax on it too
[1:30:23] so I mean that's pretty good deal you me
[1:30:24] if I needed gas in my car and didn't
[1:30:26] have the money my God could do it but as
[1:30:29] long as I can do it I wouldn't have
[1:30:30] faith enough to ask him but I've got
[1:30:33] faith to ask him tonight give me more
[1:30:35] love Lord give me more compassion Lord
[1:30:38] May Word of Life Church not only be not
[1:30:40] known as a nice church and a church who
[1:30:43] does this and that and the other may we
[1:30:45] be known as a compassionate loving
[1:30:48] people that can forgive those that run
[1:30:50] us down and talk about us come on
[1:30:52] somebody let's have church on Wednesday
[1:30:55] night let us be known Our Testimony be
[1:30:58] known that we pray for those that
[1:31:00] despitefully use it and we forgive those
[1:31:03] that trespass against us amen oh my 1
[1:31:08] John
[1:31:09] 3:17 who so hath this world's good and
[1:31:13] seeth his brother have need and shut us
[1:31:17] up his bows of
[1:31:20] compassion from him how dwell us the
[1:31:23] love love of God in
[1:31:25] him so here the Apostle of Love is
[1:31:29] questioning where a person was truly
[1:31:31] even born again if they had material
[1:31:35] means to help someone else who was needy
[1:31:38] and they wouldn't do it if you lived in
[1:31:40] the first century they questioned your
[1:31:42] Holy
[1:31:44] Ghost well if they questioned it I think
[1:31:46] I've got a right to do the same you say
[1:31:48] I'm not a judge but I am a fruit
[1:31:52] inspector comes with my vocation I'm a
[1:31:54] fruit inspector now watch Peter says
[1:31:58] finally be all of One mind having
[1:32:00] compassion one of another love as
[1:32:03] Brethren be pitiful and the meaning of
[1:32:06] that word is
[1:32:08] tenderhearted and
[1:32:11] compassionate be
[1:32:13] courteous and this is one of our
[1:32:15] struggles in this age right here I want
[1:32:19] to give you a warning right here th Tire
[1:32:22] Church age it says concerning the last
[1:32:25] days that because of abounding iniquity
[1:32:29] the love of many will wax
[1:32:33] cold in the L of sin or last age self
[1:32:39] love and love for material things will
[1:32:44] take place of the true love of God
[1:32:54] listen selflove and love for material
[1:32:58] things will take the place of the true
[1:33:02] love of
[1:33:03] God we need to guard against the power
[1:33:07] of sin in these last days so many listen
[1:33:11] now this is a warning to us this is our
[1:33:13] time frame so many are getting so
[1:33:20] hard because they haven't realized the
[1:33:24] effect of this last day
[1:33:29] spirit I don't mind telling you some of
[1:33:31] the hardest people I've ever dealt with
[1:33:33] in my life are message
[1:33:36] people and you know what's heartbreaking
[1:33:39] I preach in a lot of Youth conventions
[1:33:40] and a lot of Youth Camps over the years
[1:33:42] and I've seen youth you know from this
[1:33:45] high and watch them grow up and become
[1:33:46] bigger and bigger and bigger and taller
[1:33:48] and older more mature and so on and so
[1:33:50] on but you know what is also so
[1:33:52] heartbreaking is to walk watch them
[1:33:54] become
[1:33:56] hard-hearted to where the word no longer
[1:33:58] moves them they don't have no more tears
[1:34:00] to cry you don't see them make an altar
[1:34:04] anymore you don't see them because you
[1:34:07] know they've sat there and they've went
[1:34:08] from one Youth Camp to another to
[1:34:10] another and they've got Camp meet and
[1:34:12] cramps as the prophet said and they've
[1:34:14] heard this preacher that preacher that
[1:34:16] preacher their pastors tried to bring in
[1:34:18] ministers you no matter where they go to
[1:34:20] church that would be a blessing and a
[1:34:22] help to them and it becomes to where
[1:34:25] well so what you know we've had this guy
[1:34:26] and that guy and that guy I want
[1:34:28] somebody that'll move me it ain't
[1:34:30] somebody that'll move you it's you
[1:34:31] moving yourself it's you surrendering
[1:34:34] your selfishness to the Lord God what is
[1:34:38] going to dominate L to seea but it will
[1:34:41] not dominate The Bride self love self
[1:34:46] love oh come on I wish somebody preach
[1:34:48] with me tonight it's going to be one of
[1:34:50] the things that every person in this
[1:34:52] building must put under your feet even
[1:34:55] with the Holy Ghost it will be something
[1:34:58] that will war against our flesh because
[1:35:02] there's something that the part of the
[1:35:04] anointing the accumulative spirit of the
[1:35:06] last day will dominate self why it is
[1:35:10] Satan trying to make man think he is a
[1:35:15] God right so man what he got self-help
[1:35:18] books on this and self-help on that and
[1:35:21] self-help on something else we might as
[1:35:23] well admit it we cannot help ourself we
[1:35:26] are lost without God even after we
[1:35:29] become Christians we need the Holy Ghost
[1:35:32] after we get the Holy Ghost we still
[1:35:35] need to be corrected by the word of God
[1:35:38] but look at a lot of the message people
[1:35:40] stay home and play a tape they wouldn't
[1:35:42] darken a church door for nothing why
[1:35:44] they fell underneath this thing of
[1:35:47] selflove people sitting at home and
[1:35:49] rather stream than they would to put
[1:35:51] Force effort come to the house of God I
[1:35:53] say shame on you if you're able to come
[1:35:55] to the house of God you ought to be here
[1:35:58] tonight you ought to come in them doors
[1:36:00] praise the Lord with an attitude I'm
[1:36:03] going to well a little headache set me
[1:36:05] back well a little headache keep you
[1:36:07] from the soccer game and the football
[1:36:09] game come on somebody you'll go to a
[1:36:12] basketball game when your
[1:36:14] granddaughter's playing with a headache
[1:36:16] and you'll stay home and you got one and
[1:36:18] miss the house of God I say shame on you
[1:36:21] what's doing it self love and people
[1:36:24] losing the love for the house of God
[1:36:27] they're losing the love for the word
[1:36:30] they're losing the love for one
[1:36:34] another
[1:36:41] woo because of abounding iniquity the
[1:36:44] love of
[1:36:46] many shall
[1:36:48] wax
[1:36:50] wax cold in the lead of s or last self
[1:36:54] love and love for material
[1:36:58] things probably most of us have got more
[1:37:00] things than we've ever had in our life
[1:37:02] are we better
[1:37:03] off or do most of those things take up
[1:37:07] more of our
[1:37:10] time it's amazing how many people are in
[1:37:13] love with things you know why it's
[1:37:15] easier to love a thing than it is a
[1:37:18] person that's a thorn in your
[1:37:21] side God ain't going to use your car to
[1:37:24] Humble you God ain't going to use your
[1:37:26] poodle dog to get you to heaven God may
[1:37:29] use a person that's nothing but a big
[1:37:31] Brier right in your side and they love
[1:37:34] that seat right across from you and they
[1:37:36] sat there and look at you and you look
[1:37:38] at them and they Bri you every time you
[1:37:41] come to church and God said go ahead and
[1:37:43] gouge him cuz he's got too much flesh in
[1:37:46] there and then he'll have somebody else
[1:37:48] gouging them and then they're gouging
[1:37:50] you and you're gouging them why
[1:37:52] character does not come as a gift it
[1:37:55] must come by molding and making and
[1:37:57] shaping and we're living in a time when
[1:38:00] God is Not catering to our every wh
[1:38:02] we're not a bunch of spoiled brats and
[1:38:05] God's got to give us everything we ask
[1:38:07] for or we ain't going to serve him if he
[1:38:09] never answers another prayer I pray for
[1:38:12] the rest of my life I'm going to serve
[1:38:15] him I don't deserve anything he's done
[1:38:17] for me I don't deserve him being so good
[1:38:20] to me he don't have to Baby me he don't
[1:38:23] have to answer every prayer that I pray
[1:38:26] and when he says no he Oh my he offers
[1:38:29] me and I do not demand an explanation if
[1:38:33] he says no I'll say yes sir if he says
[1:38:36] wait a while I'll say yes sir why
[1:38:39] because I owed Millions times Millions
[1:38:43] times millions and he said Donnie I lose
[1:38:46] you I lose you and in order for me to
[1:38:50] stay
[1:38:51] Loos I'm going to lose loose
[1:38:54] you so if you trespass against me I'm
[1:38:58] going to loose you I'm going to set you
[1:39:00] free so when you stand before the Lord
[1:39:03] that debt won't be hanging over
[1:39:06] you I want to stay
[1:39:15] loose oh
[1:39:17] my it is time to draw nigh to
[1:39:21] God and let him fill our lives with his
[1:39:25] love or we will

[1:39:59] to be lukewarm there's only one option
[1:40:01] for me burning
[1:40:03] fire amen I'm going to be on fire now so
[1:40:06] I won't be on fire later that's exactly
[1:40:09] right I choose Holy Ghost Far Over
[1:40:11] Hellfire I choose the true baptism of
[1:40:13] the Holy Ghost and my soul so saturated
[1:40:16] the presence of God brother the D do you
[1:40:18] have to fight it why of course I do it's
[1:40:20] a spirit in the last day but I am
[1:40:23] fighting fighting and I am winning by
[1:40:25] the grace of God I said I am fighting
[1:40:27] and I am winning you I feel cess about
[1:40:30] worship sure I feel cess about this and

[1:40:40] in my
[1:40:42] life Hallelujah I ain't got room for no
[1:40:46] l to see self-love coldness of the last
[1:40:49] day
[1:40:56] it is time to draw an eye to God and let
[1:40:59] him fill our lives with his
[1:41:02] love or we will feel the coldness of the
[1:41:05] last day
[1:41:06] church and reject the truth of
[1:41:10] God which alone is
[1:41:12] able to help us oh no Lord don't let us
[1:41:18] go that
[1:41:19] way don't let us be forgiven of so much
[1:41:22] and loosed
[1:41:23] of so much tradition so much sin so many
[1:41:27] things that's unlike the Lord and then
[1:41:29] we turn right around and shut off our
[1:41:31] bowels of
[1:41:33] compassion and become so isolated from
[1:41:36] everybody El my it's becoming that way
[1:41:38] and the message we becoming so so
[1:41:40] divided and so separated how many is
[1:41:42] going to be left when we all get done
[1:41:43] well first of all we need to quit
[1:41:44] playing God let God be God and you just
[1:41:47] be happy that you're part of the family
[1:41:49] of God let God do the separa let God do
[1:41:51] the judging
[1:41:54] notice Peter again let's pick up this
[1:41:55] word courteous finally be of all of One
[1:41:58] mind having compassion one of another
[1:42:00] love his Breen be pitiful be
[1:42:03] courteous
[1:42:06] friendly
[1:42:09] kind oh my not rendering evil for evil
[1:42:15] or
[1:42:16] railing for
[1:42:19] railing railing is to speak
[1:42:21] reproachfully
[1:42:23] or
[1:42:25] reviling but contrary
[1:42:28] wise
[1:42:29] blessing so when somebody rails against
[1:42:32] you you bless them and I don't mean
[1:42:35] bless them
[1:42:36] out and some of y'all is good at
[1:42:38] blessing life
[1:42:41] blessing that that that is what Peter
[1:42:44] was
[1:42:46] saying notice
[1:42:49] blessing this is the root word of where
[1:42:52] the word a lot of us don't even like
[1:42:55] eulogy cuz we think eulogy you know is
[1:42:59] just all for the sectarian religion but
[1:43:02] notice this eulogia fair speech

[1:48:26] attentively so not just a casual how are
[1:48:29] you brother but consider
[1:48:32] attentively let us consider one another
[1:48:36] to
[1:48:38] provoke unto
[1:48:41] love and to good
[1:48:46] works and the church said amen let's B
[1:48:51] our heads
[1:48:55] praise the
[1:48:59] Lord
[1:49:03] hallelujah praise the
[1:49:05] Lord no one looking around
[1:49:09] now I wonder how
[1:49:12] many say Lord that was so
[1:49:15] true but I admit I need help with
[1:49:17] certain Avenues of it in my life father
[1:49:20] just raise your hand to him God bless
[1:49:22] you and and me say this if if you're
[1:49:25] already doing these things it's not so
[1:49:28] much that you're saying that you don't
[1:49:30] do it at all but you just want more of
[1:49:32] it you want more of it to you want it to
[1:49:35] abound in your life and to flourish and
[1:49:38] be exactly what the father you're called
[1:49:41] to be this children we're not just
[1:49:44] called to be Pride but we're called to
[1:49:46] have a certain attitude a certain
[1:49:49] Behavior a certain way that we should do
[1:49:53] don't you understand it's more than just
[1:49:55] getting together and well we're going to
[1:49:57] lift an offering and we're going to help
[1:49:59] some Churches over in Uganda we we've
[1:50:02] we've done that many many times we just
[1:50:04] did it just recently because they're
[1:50:06] experiencing some famine in certain
[1:50:08] parts and we've built churches by the
[1:50:10] grace of God all over the world we've
[1:50:12] helped buy food we've helped drill water
[1:50:14] wells we we've helped do all kinds of
[1:50:16] things like that but it's more than that
[1:50:21] that's people without a face
[1:50:24] you people if I lift an offering here
[1:50:26] tonight and say you know there there's
[1:50:28] these requests over here and over there
[1:50:29] I know what y'all would do y'all would
[1:50:32] drop money in there they don't tell how
[1:50:33] much we'd raise here in one night just
[1:50:35] no notification at all just telling you
[1:50:37] tonight but why is it we find it so much
[1:50:40] harder for those that we go to church
[1:50:43] with and we may have a little hard
[1:50:45] feeling toward or a little grievance
[1:50:47] toward it's so much easier for us to be
[1:50:50] kindhearted and tenderhearted to those
[1:50:52] that we don't know or an individual
[1:50:55] without a face or just a name or they
[1:50:57] live in a certain
[1:50:59] country but the real test is for those
[1:51:02] who don't like you as a matter of fact
[1:51:04] the prophet tells us eternal life is
[1:51:06] living for others and he said you live
[1:51:08] for that man that would kill you if he
[1:51:13] could I want you to think about that a
[1:51:17] man or woman that would absolutely kill
[1:51:19] you if they had the opportunity to do it
[1:51:21] and they could get byow was it and yet
[1:51:24] you would do something above and beyond
[1:51:27] the Call of Duty for that individual to
[1:51:30] help
[1:51:31] them you see that's what Jesus
[1:51:34] did so his life is the same whether it's
[1:51:37] in his human body or in mine or in
[1:51:42] yours now friends we're talking about
[1:51:44] bride material we've had all kinds of
[1:51:47] so-called bride revivals it's went from
[1:51:50] one theological term to another it's
[1:51:52] went from one emotional spin to
[1:51:55] another but what I'm preaching about to
[1:51:57] you from the scriptures and from the
[1:51:59] message is something this bride will
[1:52:02] have before she leaves this
[1:52:06] world
[1:52:09] hallelujah oh Lord
[1:52:13] Jesus as we bow our heads to the dust of
[1:52:16] the
[1:52:18] earth and if time goes
[1:52:20] on unless we
[1:52:23] or changed each of us will go by this
[1:52:28] way we don't know that there's a one of
[1:52:31] us here tonight that'll be back even
[1:52:33] here
[1:52:34] Sunday but we want to live every day of
[1:52:37] our life as if though it could be our
[1:52:39] last because it could
[1:52:41] be so Lord we don't want to have to call
[1:52:44] this person and that person and
[1:52:46] apologize for saying this or doing that
[1:52:49] or sewing Discord against them or what
[1:52:52] whatever
[1:52:53] Lord cuz we might be taken out of
[1:52:57] life within a matter of seconds tonight
[1:52:59] on our way home an automobile will run
[1:53:02] across the road and our life will be
[1:53:06] ended so I wouldn't have time to pick up
[1:53:08] my phone and call somebody and say hey
[1:53:11] would you forgive me I said this about
[1:53:13] you and I talked about you and I I did
[1:53:15] that and I'm I'm really sorry won't be
[1:53:18] no time so we want to live every day of
[1:53:21] our life
[1:53:23] was every
[1:53:24] debt
[1:53:26] settled so if there's things we need to
[1:53:29] make right we want to make them right
[1:53:32] now I don't want to wait till Sunday if
[1:53:34] there's anybody in this building or
[1:53:37] anyone around the world that I need to
[1:53:40] fix something with them I give you my
[1:53:43] word as your son if you will show me I
[1:53:47] will do it before the dawn of another
[1:53:50] day if there's something I need to
[1:53:54] fix something I need to apologize for I
[1:53:58] want to live every day of my life Lord
[1:54:01] God as if though it were my
[1:54:05] last Lord Jesus may you move among the
[1:54:08] ministers
[1:54:10] tonight as I mentioned it a few weeks
[1:54:12] ago to me it's no real great surprise
[1:54:15] really that as a message Community we're
[1:54:18] not any farther up the road than what we
[1:54:20] are because of the way sometimes
[1:54:23] preachers act and they're the
[1:54:26] leaders so if they're arguing and
[1:54:28] fussing and debating and this building a
[1:54:31] kingdom and this and wants a build a
[1:54:32] bigger Kingdom and this and that and the
[1:54:34] other how and the work can we expect the
[1:54:35] people to be any closer to God but if
[1:54:39] every godall man could
[1:54:41] realize he's called to edify the body
[1:54:45] not the body edify him he's called to
[1:54:50] serve he's called to bring things
[1:54:52] that'll help the body even most of the
[1:54:55] time when it will kill him to have to do
[1:54:58] it but he's called to do it help us Lord
[1:55:03] Jesus I want to be like you
[1:55:06] Lord as I mentioned earlier I have no
[1:55:08] desire to walk on water it's something
[1:55:10] I've never wanted to
[1:55:12] do I've never wanted to be able to
[1:55:14] prophesy who would be the next president
[1:55:17] or I've never wanted to be an
[1:55:19] outstanding person a great person so you
[1:55:22] could tell me this and that and I could
[1:55:24] get up and tell people well the Lord
[1:55:25] told me this and the Lord told me that
[1:55:27] the Lord told me something else and it
[1:55:28] come to
[1:55:29] pass I've seen what that
[1:55:33] produces I have no desire for that
[1:55:36] Lord but I do want to love like
[1:55:39] you I want to forgive like you cuz in
[1:55:42] the parable I don't see that this
[1:55:45] man this man didn't believe in speaking
[1:55:47] in tongues or this man didn't run or
[1:55:50] this man didn't quote the scripture and
[1:55:52] this man didn't know the Greek and the
[1:55:54] Aramaic but this man failed to show
[1:55:58] compassion and he reoccurred this
[1:56:01] massive massive debt which had him
[1:56:05] thrown not in the Dead's prison but the
[1:56:08] prison where the criminals went and
[1:56:12] there he would be
[1:56:14] tormented help us Lord God I have been
[1:56:17] forgiven
[1:56:19] much oh I didn't get out and drink
[1:56:22] around do all that stuff but I failed
[1:56:25] you so many times I've grumbled and
[1:56:28] complained and wished I wouldn't a
[1:56:30] preacher and wish I didn't have to go
[1:56:33] this way and that way and preach certain
[1:56:35] things and and that's been wrong with me
[1:56:38] and I'm so
[1:56:41] sorry we love you tonight
[1:56:43] Jesus we want to make our altar right
[1:56:46] here in our hearts father and ask you to
[1:56:49] forgive us Lord

[1:57:01] likewise we accept
[1:57:03] forgiveness and we are
