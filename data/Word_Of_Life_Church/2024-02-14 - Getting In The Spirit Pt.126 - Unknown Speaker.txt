that's going to sing can get the right channel of the spirit that the preacher is going to preach in I love it when the Lord does that Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 question answers tomorrow night for the Youth we strong for that brother Rob and brother Joe 7:00 remember that of course it be strain minute for those of you that aren't Young Folks anymore you can still stream it Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Hebrews chap 2: 10 for it became him for whom are all things for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things so it's for him and by him in bringing many sons unto Glory now listen now this is before we were even saved and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings now this word perfect is the same word we've been looking at for perfect love it's not sinlessness but its completion so remember the Lord Jesus was totally sinless but his character he had condens send from the Eternal and took on a human character that still needed to be made perfect is that a that awesome so he's made perfect or complete teos complete lacking nothing through not through miracles signs wonders raising the dead Healing The Sick and all that was part of it but that's not the way our character is actually made but through sufferings plural and then Paul goes on to say for both he that sanctifies and they who are Sanctified are all of One how was that even possible he who Sanctified and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed listen this to call them Brethren wow he is not ashamed to call them Brethren now I've just got to be honest with you tonight there's some members of my family I'm not sure I'd want y'all to know no s her look at me like y'all are kin to Angels there's some of yours you probably wouldn't want me to know how is this even possible that he is not ashamed to call us brothers and let's be realistic there's people that comes to our church maybe people that have come to our church in the past and things they have done the way they've lived my goodness we would be ashamed for anybody to know they come to our church but can you imagine him looking at us and all of our failures and shortcomings and it is not an embarrassment to call us Brothers his majesty and Glory are not compromised or given away by becoming Brotherhood with us his majesty his dignity his glory it's not compromised or given away by such a work notice what Paul goes on to say in verse 12 saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren Lord God children how can we not love him more than anything in this world so he's not ashamed of us and then it goes on to say I will declare thy name unto my brethren you realize what this is saying that we are of the same nature and the same origin and belong to the same family as the sinless Lord Jesus and then he says in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee now here this is Jesus Jesus is saying in the midst of the church I will sing praise unto thee of course your Bible readers know that this actually one of the fulfillments anyway happened in Matthew in the Book of Matthew whenever they was there at the communion table and Jesus began to expound to them a few things that was going to happen and then the Bible says they sang A Hymn Matthew 26:30 so the Lord Jesus fulfilled this scripture when he sang in the church and there wasn't but 11 of them there but they represented all of us so he sang in the church I believe he's still doing don't you and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God has given me behold I and the children which God has given me for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood now can this be scripturally correct that Paul is calling the family of God children even before they're saved this blows away a lot of our tradition don't it for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood notice what he puts in the first order he doesn't put the Flesh and Blood first but the children part for the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood now notice what he does he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil well we could say the benediction right now and go home and say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord and may life to be your rememory tonight as we pray God bless you I want to mention to you that Lance got to come home yesterday still not well but doing so much better I know i' uh appreciate your continued prayers I'm sure that there's many needs and requests among us tonight or they not let's just hold those in our hearts let's ask the Lord to open our hearts tonight to his word Lord Jesus we love you so much how could we not love you that you would so care for us that we had to come through flesh and blood and you said well if they will I will and yet before we were even born you were calling us brothers and children you were so confident in your own program you knew sin deaths sickness nothing would ever be able to stop you from accomplishing Your Divine Purpose that gives us Faith tonight Lord we ask that you would help us in this service help me to get out of out of the way father I'm your servant reporting for Duty I've studied I've prayed I've applied myself and I pray that you would come and help me Jesus help me to get out of the way be mindful of the needs of your children tonight we commit the service to you I bind every devil that would try to hinder this service Satan in the name of Jesus you are already defeated it you might as well just pack up your little Dy bag and go on back down to hell cuz we done come to have church tonight and you ain't going to stop us bless us now together father we pray in the name of Jesus and the children of God said I believe the children of God can say it better than that and the children of God said amen Ah that's more like it God bless you you can be seated I wonder for those of us here tonight many of us have been save for decades been walking with God giving him everything that we knew to give to him oh sure we've made mistakes and failures and when we would do that we would repent and make it right we've read our Bibles we've listened to tapes we've come to church we've prayed we've sang we've done many many things for him and for his children for his kingdom but when I read such things as we've just read here I wonder how many of us still lack understanding and what he has done and accomplished for us that he himself would not be ashamed to be identified with us and not be ashamed even though he knew he would find us in the depths of sin he knew that even after he saved us we would mess up so many times over and over again and some of the things things we would do would be so dumb and we would walk right into traps and snares sometimes with our eyes wide open wide open just just as fast as we can go and him doing everything that he could do to stop us and we just go headlong into it and fall short of his glory and yet he knew that I wonder Without You raising your hands tonight if there's any people here that have made friends with people and maybe acquaintances and then it developed into a friendship later and then as it went on in time that person actually became a great hindrance to you and your family and you look back and wish I wish I would have never even met that person I wish I would have never enjoyed in a in a friendship to them I didn't realize it was going to be so painful I didn't know what they were going to do to me and then we think of that and have those regrets and yet the Lord Jesus knew every time I would fall short of his glory he knew every time I would complain about having to preach things I don't like to preach he knew I would complain whenever he puts upon my heart to deal with issues and I know when I do I want to catch it I know preachers are going to call my name I know they're going to blast me I know that and then I complain about it I feel sorry for myself and he looked at me before the foundation of the world and said I love you anyway he knew every time that you would go through a trial and he would withhold understanding from you he knew you would question him he knew there' be times that you would even say it out loud do you even love me still do you not know my needs have you forgotten where I live are you not mindful of my situation he knew every time you'd do that he knew every time that Moses would scream out to God he knew every time our Prophet would would do the things that he did Elijah would do what he did he knew what Jonah would do and yet he's still not ashamed to call us family family there's some things that members of my family have done that's been a great pain to me whether on my mother's side or My Father's Side some of the way my family have turned out has brought me humiliation and they probably feel the same way about me not because that I've lived wrong but for what I've stood for because it's brought them shame even though they don't live here but yet the Lord Jesus so looked at us with all of that through years of our life and our unbelief and our fears and our anxieties all that we would go through and said I am not ashamed to call them my family as a matter fact I understand when I put attributes into flesh there's something about that flesh that W weakens the strength of that attribute to the soul and when I embody that attribute with all of its godliness and all of its Purity and when I embed that in human flesh there's something about it it no longer has the same power that it had when it was in my sinking it's like it dilutes it it Waters it down it takes away from the glory and the Splendor of what it had in my mind so he said how can that be what does it do so he said what if the children are partakers of Flesh I will become their older brother as it were and I myself will step from the fullness of the godhead bodily and I will weaken who I am I will lower my demeanor I will step in that same thing that they St i w understand how could Moses get so angry how could David when I gave him a kingdom and I gave him his enemies I gave him wives and children how could David step away from my commandment and commit adultery how could Solomon to whom I gave the outpouring of such wisdom that there had never been a man like him on the earth and allow him to build my house for my name and yet when he got old he turned his heart away from me what does that flesh do how does it so blind them to my love I want to understand so he himself become a man then he begins to From the Inside Out begin to feel fear trauma anxiety temptation as a matter of fact the prophet tells us that he was tempted by women right with drinking tempted in every Point like as we are even prayed to dodge the cross I'm so glad that prayer was not answered aren't you if it be thy will let this cup pass from me and then he even asked the question my God my God why has Thou forsaken me he didn't just say why he felt why and experienced why how many's ever experienced why it's one thing to say it it's another thing when you experience it and then he would turn it around that through the weakness of this same thing that Satan got every one of his kids whether it was Jeremiah Ezekiel naam Jonah oadi Zachariah Malachi every one of them dealt with their human flesh and he said that's the answer that's what I'll do I'll come through that weakness of humanity and pull the arrows of death into my own body I will reach out and grab them and slam them into my own chest and my heart will burst open and I will annihilate death in human flesh and I will destroy him that has the power of death that is the devil now he didn't do that in a theophany he didn't pull the spears of death and anxiety and worry and fear and bore our sorrows and our sickness he could not bear that in a theophany but he had to Bear it in human flesh and then he said I will take that Veil and in the weakness of that Veil I will conquer death hell and the grave every bit of it in the very same channel that Satan has defeated my people since the fall of Man In the Garden of Eden when you look at what he did and then realize what he has elevated us from and still left us in the weakness of this mortality anybody feel the same way I do there ain't nobody in the world I love any better than Donnie he is my favorite person don't sit there and look at me like a bunch of Holy Angels y'all are as rotten and stink and low down and no good I'm talking about your body just like I am and everybody else is and there ain't nobody you love no better and there ain't nobody that causes you more problem than your own sorry self the reason every one of us here tonight aren't any closer to God you might blame your wife you might blame your husband but the truth of it is it's you it's you can anybody say Amen it's ourselves that's our greatest enemy if brother brandham would tell us William brandham was his greatest enemy not blindness not diabetes not not you know all these types of demons that he dealt with but he said his greatest enemy was himself how many can say the same for you it's you that's your greatest enemy and yet God in saving us and giving us his own life he would still choose to leave us in this veil of weakness and humanity and from this pivotal point of where he changes us from the soul out he will start conquering again the kingdom of Hell in Bride form then what he's going to do is he's going to put the government of his body this mystical body on the earth inside this new thing that he's called the the church now this is a new word of course Church Upon This Rock I will build my church and remember it's a Brotherhood and it's not that you and I that that we're part of some other tribe and part of some other family and we were adopted in from some other family no we were attributes in the mind of God just like he was as a matter of fact we come from the same Source just at different times that's all and you're more like him than what your flesh would ever want you to realize the main difference between you and him was that he knew he existed before the foundation of the world as a matter of fact he existed in the logos form which was the pre-incarnate form of humanity because God never had a permanent body before the Lord Jesus but he existed so it was by him and through him that all things were made and remember God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but remember God is not a man God is not a man God is a spirit so God himself gave birth to a further extension of his own being unlike you and I we cannot do that and we think well Father and Son Well you think of an older man and a younger man that's not the way father and son is and the godhead father is that great Holy Light it is that which will overshadow our Joseph the Lord Jesus in the eth day it is that which is invisible and he chose to take on a human form I love the way the prophet says in in future home he thought of himself as being a human and that transmitted him down to become Jesus so he thought himself as being a human then the thought transmitted down to the Earth and landed in the womb of Mary and that then became his own body then with that body he would conquer and be able to come back in the form of the Holy Ghost and set up his government on the earth for 2,000 years his body his shoulders has been the means by which he has spread forth the gospel it has been his means of establishing the Kingdom on the earth now you may look at I said boy I tell you one thing brother Donnie it hasn't been very successful oh but I beg to differ with you it has been so successful hell has fought it in every age and still to this day has never defeated it now it's got down surely it's went down the times of the Dark Ages it's been up and down through different times and trials but Satan no matter how hard he's tried he's never been able to defeat the Church of the Living God and let me go ahead and tell you in case you don't know it he never will because Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church notice this in the spoken words original see again we read this we looked at it several times but the prophet said his shoulders is his body where the government on the earth where's the government on the earth act in his body Saints shall judge the Earth is that right Paul said I dare you to go to court with one another and not take it before the church Saints shall judge the Earth where's the government going to be upon his shoulders his body the government upon his shoulders and that's a part of the body what is it his Earthly strengths now remember he he has no other strengths upon the Earth Angels even though they are ascending and descending and they are ministering to the hirs of Salvation yet angels will never stand In a Pulpit take an iPad or a Bible stand up and take a text and preach because the seed does not pass through Angelic ministration the seed passes through his body and that is you Angels could do a much greater job in the sense of course because they're without fault and without blame but he never gave the Angels the ability to reproduce himself he gave that to the weakest of his creation on the Earth's human beings but yet he designated that through the government of the church on the earth his kingdom would be propagated his kingdom would be ruled his kingdom would have a Dominion now I know you may look at it now and say oh my goodness I can't hardly believe that God will do something like this you mean this is great as it is you're looking at it on this side of the veil you wait till we get on the other side and see how they look at it it will take your breaths away now what's this the government upon his shoulders that's a part of it what is it his Earthly strength God's Earthly strength in his word is his word made flesh in his body body on the earth bringing it to pass oh but you say brother Donnie but we're SE in the minority it don't take that many to be able to fulfill God's promised word in every age and God doesn't do it the way that man does man looks at Grace masses of numbers and you know getting everybody together and doing all this God's never done it that way God has always worked in the minority and from that Minority he does more with that Minority than Satan does in his majority he's always done it that way so watch now as the prophet's talking about his meetings when he was in India now I stood there several years ago in one of those little churches where brother brandham was a very very small place and there was absolutely 10 thousands times thousands of people that was gathered down the streets and those meetings there and it must have been absolutely awesome great Miracles Supernatural things happened people give their heart to God people got saved but I want you to know notice now how the the prophet following in the structure of the apostolic form from the book of Acts and all down through the New Testament of how that he felt like a church should be carried on and a message now remember we believe that he came to restore our hearts back to the original faith is that right now watch he's talking about the meetings there in India what could I do there wasn't a thing perhaps maybe say there just to say there's a hundred, thousand of them now think a 100,000 that had got saved say in those days in those meetings nothing I could do there was nobody to give to them the message that I believe there wasn't even a Pentecostal denomination that would cooperate with me all of those Souls probably drifted back into seeks chains Buddhism whatever more they come from no place to put them so you mean those hundreds of 100,000 Souls was his estimate that got saved and they went right back where they come from why there was no shoulders in India to carry on the work now wait a minute what about the spirit of God what wasn't angels in India of course they are well you know not when ever he was there in the early 50s they had already been making tapes since 1947 well wonder why that he did not set up home take churches so whenever he got back home that he would just start sending hundreds and hundreds of tapes over there in India and said well really y'all don't need a church you don't need a a pastor or deacons or nothing like that y'all can just stay home and listen to me preach and it'll be the same thing as going to church but apparently he didn't believe it that way well come on now don't get mad at me I know message people do and that's all they are they're message people they're not really bride because if they were bride they would do what Their Prophet T them to do if God's in your heart you can't wait till them doors are open and he said if you don't feel that way it's time you got to praying which lets me know a lot of message people need to go to pray now notice he said there was no place to put him that's a shame that's a disgrace because I had no cooperation because of the stand that I take now perhaps the Durban meeting now this of course is in South Africa perhaps the Durban meeting not having it rightly and the people see such a scattered amongst the Pentecostal faith and so forth the people didn't know what to do they had no place to go well why would you need a place to go if you receive Jesus and get everything you need and one of brother Ram's meetings why would you need a place to go hello why why would you need a place to go because you've got to assemble yourself together with where the government of God is being orchestrated in that Community where you live now watch this is what the prophet said and this is what he believed you haven't listened to this tape in a while or do you good to listen to it takeing sides of Jesus 1962 now the people didn't know what to do they had no place to go now again I ask you why didn't when he got home he just SED already while he was there he would have had time looking at all the response of the people and just have a bunch of those tapes air dropped have them aird dropped over there well brother Donnie had costs a lot of money well what's one Soul worth you mean one soul is not worth several hundred th000 or whatever more to send a bunch of tapes up and just set up home churches now we're going to do this because there's no preachers here yet and this will keep you all well that's what they're doing now come on friends I know you don't understand it but in Africa and India and different parts of the world there's preachers that are sitting down and quit preaching well I'll tell you one thing they should they should set out because if if they ain't called a bit more than that they don't deserve to be in the pull pit no way a god call man they ain't no devil they ain't no Bishop there ain't nobody else going to set him down because God called him and no man didn't call him praise the Lord now notice he goes on back to India again what if I was in India I'll go back to India and there I'd say to these people maybe they'd have thousands of them say there for a week or two and they'd see the ministry and they'd love it and they believe it's the truth and they'd come out of heathenism and maybe two or three weeks when I was over there there the nights and maybe a 100,000 converted to Christ nowhere to go again he comes back to nowhere to go and yet some people around the message look at that it's no big deal you know why they don't believe the message the way he did well praise the Lord Saints now this apparently was a big thing to him because he just keeps going back to it which is why I keep going back to it because I got the same holy ghost in me that he had in him and if you got it in you you'll say amen and you'll do the same thing that he said now watch the next day take a plane and start back to Rome then to the United States and leave them there like sheep Among Wolves what if oh no don't tell me he's going to what if I had a group of men young men trained in the message and say now wait a minute before I leave here we are going to set in order these churches now remember this is what Paul did on the aisle of Creet remember I told you to you not long ago over a 100 cities from the north part of the island to the South but Paul got called away and he sends Titus back to set the churches in order and Paul told Titus when you go he was going under the apostolic umbrella of Paul and he said ordain Elders in every city now remember brother brandham was a word Prophet so what's he pointing us back to how the original church was founded and and also how they expanded now listen how they were founded and how they expanded now before I leave here we're going to set in order these churches I'll have a man who I've already telegrammed him they've got the money they're on the road right now to take over this a good man there's two or three young men with him who'll be his helpers and assistants well I I guess I don't understand I mean brother R didn't say there's three or four tape recorders coming and there's MP3 players coming and there's CD players coming and then we we got backup CD players and we got backup real are real players I mean I I I just can't hardly believe that brother brandom was wanting to put men men men didn't they know know they were full of mistakes he did just like he himself was that's right praise the Lord just like Paul was just like Peter was just like all of us are but that's God's choice that's right God has never called a tape player brother that's right and never will God has never said I will sing among the tapes but I will sing in the church among my brethren and somebody said now watch this is what the prophet now is giving to the people and the the brothers have come together ask him questions and about the state of the church at the Tabernacle that he's going to preach a little bit and he titles this taking size of Jesus but first he goes into the questions and here you're hearing from his heart something that he never said quite like this anywhere else but he's at home now now if you really want to get a lot of the doctrines of the message if you'll notice when he's at home it's when he really opens it up when he's out there among the goats of Pentecost and the goats of the denomination he'll water it down for him a little here and a little there but the real meat of it mm following back to where the Sheep pin was and if you'll notice when the Lord showed him the vision of the stored of food you'll notice it wasn't in Chicago it wasn't in Los Angeles but it was from that little Storehouse there on 8 and pin street now watch this and a church of this face can be set there with there will be an outpost in India an outpost in Germany an outpost in Switzerland oh if the Lord could let him look beyond the curtain of time tonight now when he was here he never got to see the this quote fulfilled he never got to see Outpost of the message all over the world do you realize brother Daryl which is not here tonight is not feeling well brother Daryl brother Jeff snod gra many ministers that's been able to travel International they have been able to see with their own eyes what God never allowed brother brandham to see with his he never got to preach in message churches in Switzerland and Luzon when he was there in 1955 he never got to preach in message churches in France the way I've been allowed to he was never allowed to go and preach in many of these countries that Servants of God have been allowed to go and never saw the message unveiled in that but still Harry he had the apostolic vision and burden well friend if we're really followers of this message I I believe we will get under the same anointing the same desire the same pulsation of the Holy Ghost that he was under and what was that pulsation to set up little outposts and let it go exactly the way the apostolic order was and have men that are called of God led by the spirit of God preaching the word and Word of Life Church said am a Church of this faith can be set in India there will be an outpost in India Outpost in Germany Outpost in Switzerland why right now we should have had them all around the Nations where I've been and the message then from there comes another and another and another you see what I mean now watch he he talks about Matson Bose and then this next paragraph but just watch what that man did did maton Boer trinitarian never did really see brother brandom as who he was or brother brandom benam but I love you I love you now Matson me and you's right here and you ain't going nowhere and he said I put my arms around him me and you's going to stay right here and we're oh but bam but bam I sure do love who I sure do love who butter bam but I want you to notice what he says about this man watch what that man did in his missions over there one man cuz he could send right back to Chicago and pick up Burton and all the rest of them and send them over there like that and start the work doing till they're getting up in the tens of thousands of one little Revival not a man with gifts just a man who had enough courage to go there and start what could have been done under this it would have been ranking in the Millions every time I read this I feel so sorry for him cuz Caroline never got to see it he never got to travel all over the world and think about praise God I'm holding a convention in Johannesburg and it'll be mainly message folks I'm going to Durban I've walked the streets in Durban where he was at I walked by the hotel where he stayed I've been in many of those places and realize that I am so privileged to preach to one message church after another after another and his heart's desire was to see it set up that way why he knew they could not survive and be what they were supposed to be by staying at home and just playing a tape I thank God for streaming I'm grateful for but look friend I've had to stream myself when I've been sick or Carol been sick and which stay home and stream and I'll tell you what I do every time I get done streaming either me or her one will say it thank God we don't have to stream all the time I'm grateful for streaming and I know there's people that are sick and people that don't have a church in their Community but I'm so grateful to God that I've got one where I live I'm so grateful to God that I can come to the house of God not just to be here not just to be in this building but to be with you and you and you and you and you as you bring your lick of fire and that presence gets greater and greater and greater oh how blessed we are can you imagine Brother renom last year when we had the dedication of this place and all them message people the majority of message people hundreds of them hundreds of them that were gathered here as I set up here on the platform and I looked out there and I couldn't keep from thinking brother brandham never got to preach in a message convention one of the last sermons that he ever preached things that are to be Rialto California an Assembly of God Church Assembly of God brother Harvey and sister Charley was at the place when he preached the Rapture brother Harvey told me before it was at a a meal there the banquet thing and they were in the back of the building trying to clean up the dishes right brother Harvey taking the tablecloth off the table brother Brandon up there preaching them was standing back there waving at him trying to get him to shut up he never even slowed down you'd never know that would you by listening to the Rapture next time you listen to it you can listen to it with a little better understanding and boy am I glad he never paid no no attention to them waivers because God knew there's going to be some down here waving glory to God thank God for the Rapture cuz there was sa he preached in there and never said nowhere else you imagine how distracting that M must have been for a preacher no deacons like we got in our assembly no assistant ministers there to pull with him but working in everywhere that he went them threatened to throw him out we're not supporting the meeting but he stood there by himself many times thank God God for a prophet who was able to Bray all the things that he did in order to bring you and I a rapturing message that would so build our faith in the gospel that one day it'll change our bodies aren't you glad he was a real man of God that stayed there and fought right through all hell oh my I just wonder what you'd say today if he knew all over the Earth his message I swept I've stood in homes in India and Africa and third world countries they didn't even have a floor dir we just recently put a concrete floor in a big church in Africa you did oh you didn't know it did and for years after we built the building they didn't have no floor well you imagine a bunch of holy rers getting in there shouting and dancing it was a dust storm every time they'd go to church you ain't never seen nothing you get amongst some Africans they ain't like you white people they ain't like you white people you sitting there watching you watch and and setting a timer on me they go to church they go to have church they go to church they sat there they may walk they may hitch Shack they may get in a bicycle they ain't got all the time schedule that we have they're there to stay I mean until God moves oh my I saw them pictures not long ago and I thought my thank you Lord thank you and yet the prophet of God you imagine 44 churches and one of the African nations still waiting for me to come and dedicate their buildings that you built that's only in one country oh if God would let him look beyond the curtain of time and look down into Malawi and look into Zimbabwe when there was a man that had found a half of a message book and a garbage can but at least he got the hi with the address in Jeffersonville and then a man ordered him and whenever he got he start handing it around and Revival broke out in some of the campuses there and some of the great preachers of that that country was men that was in in school and educated that man that did that later left the message can you imagine all he was was a carrier he was a carrier but out of there come one church and another and another and another and another it's gone around the world and little old places out in vutu where brother Ron Peterson has been many times a little tiny island in the South Pacific out in the middle of nowhere the most of you probably didn't even know existed and yet you know what they may not have any the great high class culture and this and that that we've got but there was a word of God went there the message of Malachi 4 up in Alaska where you also built another church all around the world where the word of God has went and people say what kind of strange people is it it's a word bride God placed his seed in the Inu God placed his seed in the Apache God placed his seed Hallelujah and all over the world and all skin colors and all color come on Church why God wanted his government spread over the world and Satan hates her like never [Applause] before oh my what could have been done under this had been ranking in the millions brother Neville brother rutle brother chce brother beer all your brethren here juny wherever you are in the rest of your brethren God richly bless you I see Terry Lyn Charlie Cox David wow so he's not saying I see Wallen sack I see Sony I see [Music] RCA I see Terry Lynn Charlie Cox David a lot of you young men God anoint you my how we'd like to pick up a handful of you to be an evangelism and set you somewhere set you somewhere you see that's the way the apostolic church was they didn't split and divide a church so they could have their own they didn't go out on their own and just start a big deal this is the way they done it well come on read your Bible take more time to read the Bible and keep your head off of Tik Tok and Facebook and all that bunch of nonsense and you'll find out I'm preaching you the truth now notice how the prophet was picking up exactly the way that Paul did it to be able to set you out somewhere why you wouldn't want to go to India or go to South Africa somewhere and thousands and thousands get sa and send some knead down there that ain't going to do nothing but preach himself right well come on you want to pick somebody that you watched his wife someone who has the same vision that's right oh praise the Lord notice this he says knowing that you've come up you can stand and know the say it well you you mean that's important well if you're going to be a message Church you're going to have to know the message and not only that you're going to have to preach it it ain't good enough to be written in your bylaws and never say nothing about the prophet from the pull pit that's right it don't do a bit of good to say oh yeah we really really really really really really really believe it and you don't ever say nothing about it you don't ever really preach the message of Malachi 4 I'm going to call you what you are you're a lying hypocrite because if you really believe this message you're going to preach this me oh brother Donnie I'll tell you one thing I've got more wisdom than you have call it what you want to I call it ignorance I don't call it wisdom how in the world can you have the truth and holding it back from people that are looking to you I don't care who you are young old big fat ugly pretty whatever you are we're going to be obligated to tell people the truth woo knowing that you've come up and you can stand and know the message and study to prove yourself if you feel a call in your life I see two three young men four or five sitting under that back under the back row like that you're young men I'm getting old brother Neville's getting old we're middle-aged men now listen I'd like for some of you tape only people to quote this for me I give you a dollar if you will I'll give you 10 if you believe it I didn't bring much money to church tonight but I don't figure I'll be out on no way brother nille I is getting old middle-aged men if time rolls on we're going to walk off the scene after a while and no no that can't be can it do you all believe this or not but how many so-called message people have never read this quote and never will you know why they don't believe what they say they believe oh I believe every word every word you're lying through your teeth isn't it amazing now he doesn't say that a Wallen sack is going to fill his shoes oh brother Jackie bless your heart buddy you'll be getting emails this week after this one if time rolls on we're going to walk off the scene after a while and you've got to feel our shoes my and if you can get the preacher straight boy that's a miracle if you can get the preacher straight and him going right look what he's going to do he's going to influence it would take hundreds of these things that's it we're just beating at it you see you've got to get up oh Lord oh no oh no don't run out please don't run off we've got to get a system don't be scared the next two words should be able to help if you say Amen God's system that was God's way back there that was God's way in the early church age and I believe it's God's way for us to do it oh my now let's read in Revelation chap 2: 2 I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how that's can bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars wow you mean people were trying men who said they were Apostles now to be classified as an apostle in the time this was written in the Book of Revelation that was the highest class yes Apostles secondar prophets evangelist teachers and so on so the apostles oh my whenever you said Apostle you think Peter James John you know so there was a group of people in this church age and they were cling I'm an apostle I'm sent forth that's what the word means one that's sent forth with a message I'm sent forth but he said thou Hast tried them which say they are upon OST Les look at the word tried it means examine make trial of test for the purpose of ascertaining his quality now you understand that as leoty you have the right as the people of God to try every preacher you mean that brother darling I do me every other preacher you've got a right to look into the word you've got a right to listen to tapes you've got a right well you're going to put your soul in the care of them men you better try now the Lord is actually bragging on this church because this is what they done so he said thou has tried them which say they are our Apostles apostos messenger he that is sent a delegate one sent forth with orders so they were remain going about of course like it's always been you know we're sent of God hallelujah we've been sent of God to do this and that and God bragged on them and said you all have tried them that say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars whoa now what's this in the Ephesians in church Age The Prophet reads the scripture that we just read he said thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liar see that apostasy had already begin to set in the first church in the first age already started right there because the elect and the true church who wanted to keep the precepts of the Bible and keep the words that Jesus said in his testimony that already began to pull away something be to happen there have been false teachers rise up people who were teaching wrong contrary to the scripture trying to bring in something or add something and that's the reason he gave this Revelation to the church and said whosoever takes away or adds to your part will be taken out of the book of life just don't meddle with God's word and the church said now watch this in the Ephesians Church age in the church age book again the same scripture thou has tried them to say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars my that is a blunt statement thou Hast tried them who call themselves Apostles isn't that presumptuous what right has a people to try those who call themselves Apostles and how do they try them oh I love this here it is Galatians 1:8 but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other the gospel unto you than which we have already preached unto you let him be a cursed it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even adopt or a dash of it Paul knew it was God who' spoken to him so he said even if I come back and try to give oh my listen this a second Revelation try to make one little change and what I gave originally let me be a cursed much less some bowlegged two before a preacher that ain't never even been in the presence of God long enough to get the Holy Ghost and he's going to stand up and say well I think this and I I don't care what they think I'm going to believe God's Bible and I'm going to believe God's Prophet over every preacher and the Baptist and the Methodist and the Church of God and every one of them in this message if they ain't saying what the prophet of God said come on somebody oh my notice so Paul knew God gave him that Revelation it was impossible for God to change it he said even if I try to make one little change in what I gave originally let me be a cursed Paul knew the first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation then a second Revelation if he did it would be changing his mind he can give listen this beautiful he can give a revelation and then add to it amen amen he can add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman then later designated that seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the same bloodline in David what's he doing giving more information on the same Revelation oh I'd make a good song more information on the same Revelation unfolding God's precious word more information on the same Revelation unfolding God's precious word he can't never change his mind he can't never change his word because he's God he cannot change he builds Revelation upon Revelation yeah well Glory notice he can give a revelation then add to it so what did he do he gave the Revelation then he said all right Abraham you're a part of it then he said David you're a part of it what's he doing adding more information but it was the same revelation listen this it only gave the people more information don't you understand friends why we need this message it gives us more Revelation but it gives us more information of the original Revelation that's written in our Holy Bible this message did not come to throw away your Bible I love my Bible now more than I've ever loved it in my life anybody that says I don't preach the Bible is a bald-faced liar and you come face me and I'll show you I do preach the Bible I preach it I quote it I live it I sleep it I eat it I listen to it I believe my Bible I love my Bible and this message only adds more Revelation to my Bible and more information it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it but God's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed Hallelujah and see what those false prophets were doing they came with their own word those Ephesians knew that word as Paul had taught it and they were full of the Holy Ghost by laying on of Paul's hands and they looked those false prophets in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you are therefore false and let me just say it this way so it'll be easy understood any preacher I don't care how long he's been around or how many years he's preached if he stops saying what God's Prophet says and starts adding here and taking away there if need be I will do likewise you sir are a liar and I hope you have got enough guts that if I ever go nuts and lose my mind and I start saying things that ain't what he said that you all walk right up to me and say brother Donnie you're not saying what the prophet said well come on children we our souls at stake here we want to be right before God we're not following the men we're following the kingdom of God and the government is upon the shoulders of the body not just the preachers but on you as [Applause] well Oh my he said oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it's not you that really tries the Apostle and the prophet and teacher it's the word that tries him one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the lay of s Church Ag and you will know if he's a real one sent from God or not yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word come on now for a moment not for one I ow up in that last age when there will be many false prophets appearing notice one of the tactics always false prophets will use watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you'll be lost yeah but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene if he is truly that prophet he will be crying out get back to the word or you are lost I can follow a man like them he won't build on a private Revelation or interpretation brother Randy Willis sent me a YouTube video the other day I showed it brother Rob showed it with some different ones and it's TL osbor standing explaining about when he went to Oregon and he said whenever he walked in there and he saw brother brandham there he said I saw Christ in that man he said I seen Jesus of course any he went on to say forget all that other foolishness that happened I'm talking about whenever I knew him I thought yeah what you're identifying as foolishness is what we call the opening of The Seven Seals when the full word is born into full manifestation but you imagine that man when he stands before God and whenever he stood there and said he saw Christ that brother brandham represented Christ oh some of these liars and hypocrites have left the message and they go around want to accuse a prophet of this and that and other you ought to go back to the testimony of those who were his contemporaries if they all looked at him as being a liar and the devil why do they all want his anointing if they looked at him as being a false prophet why didn't they make their videos and refute him it's easy after he's done come and gone for you bunch of yellow belly cowards to stand up I'd like to see you walk before him if that Prophet was on the earth you might walk before him but they'd pack you out come on somebody woo Hallelujah brother Donnie where you going with this I'll tell you where we're going with this we're going to leave this world with this we are taking our stand for Jesus Christ the word I don't know about you friend I'm more hungry for heaven than I've ever been in my life I've got more to go to heaven for than I had yesterday I'm sick of this world I'm sick of sin I'm sick of unbelief I'm sick of paty waste preachers let's get the light one in let's get full of the Holy Ghost let's get out of this place and go home let's leave this hell ho and let the devil have it good Lord what happened to y' was Pastor John the Baptist must have walked out here tonight didn't he man I already they were denying the word and setting up their own Creeds and philosophies instead of the word listen friends how dangerous this is denying the word setting up their own own Creeds and philosophies instead of the word that is Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be anti- is to be anti- Jesus to be anti- word is to be Antichrist but the tricky part about being Antichrist is they won't deny the cross they won't deny Heaven they won't deny hell they won't deny the power of the blood some of the Antichrist right around this message will preach the church ages they will preach 1909 they'll preach the pillar of fire they'll preach part of it but they go to deviating here and changing it there so subtly and so slow hi this Lord Jesus because the spirit and the word are one and if you are anti word you'll have to be Antichrist and if it started in the first church it will have to grow until the end when it takes over and that is exactly oh my God help us what you'll see as we cover all the ages it starts out real small Satan never shows you what you're going to wind up being being but he starts you out so tiny remember Eve did not deny or question a whole book one word she didn't question a paragraph a sentence one word God help us the infallibility of the word is repudiated by the false Apostles of the false church now it is easy to get a wrong impression I'll close here momentarily of what we're talking about because I'm making this so strong it could sound to you as though this anti- word Antichrist spirit is a complete repudiation of the word a denial of the Bible culminating in its rejection no sir it is not that what it is is revelation 22819 then then you reach the scripture for I testify every man that Hearth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book If any man shall take away from the words of the prophecy God shall take away his part out of The Book of Life there will be preachers whose name was written in the book of life and they will stand up and preach trinitarian baptism there will be preachers that have preached this message and they'll stand up and say well I am an apostle of the message and I am sent to bring Clarity to what brother Bram said I'm sent to fill in the places he left out no you need to leave out from underneath that man that's right don't you understand friend there's going to be message preachers that it's going to miss the Rapture and they're going to stand before God and the Very message they refuse to preach they think they're going to stand with Paul get a hold of yourself Paul is not your messenger preachers in this message think they're going to stand by Paul you're not going to stand by Paul Elijah is your church a messenger and if you go against his teaching thinking you're standing with Paul you're not going to stand with Paul it will be that Prophet that will stand there and the other men of God who tried to warn you and you went right over the top of it God help us it is the changing of even one word by taking away or adding to it it is the original trick of Satan in the Garden of Eden he just added one little word to what God Said that did it it brought death and destruction and in Ephesus was just the same just a word added just a word taken away and the anti- word Antichrist Spirit began to flourish this one here in God of this evil age I shudder every time I've every time I listen to this I've listened to this this sermon many many times and it always just does something to me remember it was an unpardonable sin three times in the Bible for any persons to add one word of their own interpretation to God's word after it had been Vindicated the truth friends unpardonable unpardonable no forgiveness when we overstep the boundary of God's word and some of the worst ones that's guilty of it's preachers I wonder how many of them in our ranks have already crossed the line because they exalt their own ability and their own wisdom socalled and they think they know more about this and that and the other than a Vindicated prophet of God when we get that idea it shows how little we do know Lord God In the Garden of Eden one word added caused death when balam added the word that we all the same God never did forgive Israel every one of the than perished in the wilderness except the three that God brought out Jesus said there everyone dead that's Eternal separated they're all gone never was forgiven and he says it again it's an unpardonable sin never forgiven them and then watch how he directs this to us flee it Children of the evening light do you understand what that means it's going to be amongst us brother Larry it's going to come amongst us and this is our warning flee it brother Joel flee your children you will be Tried by this every one of us we'll be tried huh I don't know about you I want to take my stand on God's word let's about it merciful god Lord Jesus what a fearful time we know this has been in every age and the repetitive behavior of Satan he's like clockwork we can watch him he found something that worked in the Garden of Eden and he's used it ever since dear God I pray don't let there be a one of us sitting here tonight that have heard this Lord don't let us walk away hide me Jesus Keep Me Lord Keep Me Lord God no Lord if I live to March the 27th it will be 41 years since I preached the first message about your Prophet 41 years ago in our little church in Kentucky March the 27th 1983 Jesus I'm more fearful now than I was then how many have we seen come and go Lord how many preaches have we seen Fall by the wayside how many have we seen that built their own little agenda their own little deal or they never built it right off but they started letting go of this word and that word and another word and well you know what we we we just we don't accept the prophet's teaching on this and we don't accept AC it on that and we don't accept it on something else they never intend most of them to leave the message in its entirety they just start out with one little point and then another and then another and another Israel had no intention of ever becoming idolators they had no intention of ever offering their children in the arms of Kos this molten God that stood 9 to 10 foot tall Hollow on its inside and they would build a fire on the inside of it and heat up this image and take their children and lay them in the arms of this Burning molten image and their babies would scream and holler as the flesh would be cooked off their bodies and they would die in the arms of kibos they never intended to do that when they started committing idolatry but they just left off this and then a little more and then a little more and a little more they never started offering their children that way they never started falling down before the idols of Moab and Ammon but Satan knew that would be their end that's where he would take him to he does us the same way if we'll compromise a little here and well you know we we we just choose not to go this way well yeah we believe the message but we we just you know we're Sovereign and so we feel like we we don't have to do this in our church God I pray you'd help us help me Lord God as the pastor of this church I never get foolish and stupid and ignorant and arrogant and puffed up till I think I know more about your way than your Prophet does help the preachers around the world in this message God so no wonder we got one in the southern hemisphere preaching that he's Elohim and hundreds of his people bowing before him we've got others in the North Country preaching they're the Holy Ghost himself others preaching all kinds of nonsense they didn't start out that way but they started leaving this quote out and that one out that's how they got into this filth and Tommy rot just as much whoredom as any organization in the world how does Jesus hide me Lord please father if you ever see that I'd start to go astray take me cut my life short take me out if I get stubborn and hard-headed take me out God don't let me bring reproach on this word don't let me bring reproach on you Jesus don't let me lead your children astray please father help me May our church always be a beacon May our church always be a place where the sick can be healed the Lost can be saved the desperate can be delivered Lord God May our church always be a church that believes in the phenomena and the supernatural hand of God may we always be a church that believes in Holiness and purity and saying what the word says Lord please father please Hallelujah raise your heads if you would you can't see it tonight but I've got my banner hoisted up it's the banner of the blood of the Lord Jesus and I still believe it's what it takes to cleanse us on that Banner is also sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost restoration of the word in the last days back to the original Apostolic Faith I believe in still preaching the doctrine that's in the New Testament I still believe in preaching the message too not just being a silent believer the Bible tells us there was Pharisees who who believed somebody would you please stand up and please explain to me how you could be a Pharisee and believe how could you still be a Baptist and believe how could you still be a Church of Christ and believe but we have them how could you be a Pentecostal and still believe because you hybridize like Eve did and your womb becomes spoiled with rotten defiled SE seed as long as I'm here as your pastor y'all can vote me out of course anytime you want to you can have an election after this service tonight if you wish but as long as I'm here as your pastor and I'm in your right mind I plan on preaching the new birth baptism of the Holy Ghost water baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the restoration of the end time the Mysteries that was lost down through the church ages I plan on keeping them I plan on still preaching the message of Malachi 4 and I plan on mentioning his name and I plan on reading quotes from the message of the hour I plan on still introducing to our young people they can have their own experience with God I still plan on praying for the sick and casting out Devils that's my banner and I want the devil to know because we moved in a new church I have no intention on compromising I'd rather have five in here than to have 5,000 if we could get that many in here and have a bunch of dead beats and ain't even born of the spirit of God I'd rather have five people that was full of the Holy Ghost and we'll turn this community upside down with five people filled with the spirit of God now I ask you I have made my stand on the banner that I fly high I ask you where do you stand amen where do you stand men women boys girls what about you on the internet where do you stand we going to stand for this gospel hallelujah hallelujah all friends if we'll stand for him he will stand for Us Praise the Lord praise the Lord we've got a little brother that's been asking his mom and dad about being baptized and it's really been pressing him so we want to baptize him tonight but before we do let's just sing just a little bit and just Worship the Lord let's just create just a little bit of atmosphere here can we I know these things can be a little bit scary I know they can I understand they're scary for me you believe whatever you want to about this service and you just take it however you wish to but when I hear the Holy Ghost saying what he said tonight it scares me it scares me as a mortal well brother Don don't you think you got the Holy Ghost I do don't scare me cuz I ain't afraid I ain't got it it scares me for those that ain't it scares me for men that I know this very hour are meddling with this word replacing relocating dissecting minimizing this don't matter that don't matter God have mercy on us children may we never do such to God's word can we lay our hands over on one another let's just pray for one another that God will strengthen us and help us to be solid sound firm Believers in the truth hallelujah Hallelujah Lord God we have our hands laid one upon the other tonight father we're asking you Jesus Keep Us true keep us true I don't imagine Deus ever thought himself to be one that would have ever turned his back on Paul I don't imagine when Deus started off saying he believed the message and he was so caught up in it and promoting it and all my the man was such a dynamic preacher I don't imagine he ever thought he would ever forsake you but the Bible says having loved this present world he walked away way keep us Jesus Keep Us true Lord God if we have to walk alone we have to Walk This Way by ourselves keep us Jesus help me Lord give me strengths give me wisdom oh God give me the anointing like I've never had it before in my life

Lord may they feel a shaking down in their soul father that we are more determined tonight after this service we will not compromise this word we will not trade it off it would be a waste Lord of my entire life for me to live and preach and do whatever that I might have done down through the years and then right down to the end and add a word or take away from the word of God and blaspheme help us Lord Jesus Keep Us true father Keep Us Faithful Lord God in the name of Jesus I don't want just a baptism of fire to fill our church I don't want just a baptism of the supernatural but a baptism of

baptized the right way our children to be raised this way God dealing with their hearts not because it's a tradition because God himself dealing with them Heavenly Father dear God our little brother been wanting to be baptized ized and we believe it's been you dealing with his heart we're asking you father in the name of Jesus Lord that you would just deal further with him Lord I can baptize him in water but only you can fill his soul with the Holy Ghost I pray Lord God as he comes to take on your name and water baptism and assemble Lord to the to the church to the world that they'd be able to see that he's made a confession that you've done something for him and you've been dealing with him I pray Heavenly Father that he would not stop here but it would keep on praying reading his Bible coming to church hungering for that spirit of God to indwell him may you be with him Lord may he walk the walk that is pleasing to you I pray in Jesus name the par upon your confession of faith in the Lord Jesus I'm going to baptize you tonight in his name okay you just keep walking according to his word let him fill you with his presence okay I baptize this my little brother in the name of the
