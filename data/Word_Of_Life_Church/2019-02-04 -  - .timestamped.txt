[0:00] it's not a time to lay down it's a time
[0:03] for preachers not to compromise it's a
[0:08] time to fight for the gospel of Jesus
[0:10] Christ it's a time to take a strong
[0:12] conviction and strong stand in the word
[0:15] of God
[0:17] everyone's caving in under the pressure
[0:19] oh that's me you know the message is a
[0:21] little bit hard it's a little bit harsh
[0:23] and maybe we should change this and edit
[0:25] this and change this I don't preach that
[0:27] too hard you know we can't preach that
[0:28] 2012 now and that was back then in the
[0:30] 80s and 90s that was good but you know
[0:34] just compromise I don't need to preach
[0:36] so much about that and you know about
[0:37] how you live people are caving in over
[0:39] the pressure but I'm here to tell you
[0:41] this morning I'm here to stay at my post
[0:43] of duty I'm here to take a sword to
[0:46] saddle a horse and to go to Lauren
[0:48] charge hallelujah the charge in the
[0:51] battle you should thank God
[0:56] for a ministry that stands and tells you
[0:59] the truth those who love you the most
[1:03] will tell you the most truth the false
[1:09] prophets one who tells you lies tells
[1:12] you what you want to hear
