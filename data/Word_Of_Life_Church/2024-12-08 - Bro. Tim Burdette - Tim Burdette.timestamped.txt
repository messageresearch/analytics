[59:23] brother har wow but God's good ain't he
[59:27] it's good to be with you again to get
[59:29] see all of you again
[59:32] today how many believes that when you
[59:35] come on this Earth there's a purpose
[59:36] that you're
[59:38] here your purpose isn't just to come to
[59:41] Word of Life and sit on that Pew that's
[59:44] a part of
[59:45] it my purpose isn't just to come and
[59:47] preach at Life Tabernacle and Anderson
[59:50] every individual person has a purpose
[59:52] and a reason so I could say it this way
[59:56] every single person has an
[1:00:00] assignment the question is who fulfills
[1:00:04] their
[1:00:07] assignment I'm sure at times we all
[1:00:10] fulfill a part of that assignment and
[1:00:12] I'm sure at times it I miss my
[1:00:15] assignment but I'm so glad when I do
[1:00:18] miss my assignment I don't fulfill it
[1:00:20] what God wants me to I'm so grateful
[1:00:24] that he don't throw me away amen aren't
[1:00:26] you grateful for that so I want to speak
[1:00:29] on a subject today and I spoke on the
[1:00:31] kingdom versus mind World years ago at
[1:00:35] Happy Valley several times and one of my
[1:00:38] last sermons at Happy Valley was Kingdom
[1:00:40] versus mind World on the sound power of
[1:00:43] sound so I want to look at Kingdom
[1:00:46] versus mind world because the kingdom of
[1:00:48] God I'm talking about that versus the
[1:00:49] Mind world if Satan can stop you from
[1:00:52] fulfilling what God has intended you to
[1:00:54] fulfill he'll do everything
[1:00:56] in his he'll use everything in his
[1:00:58] arsenic to stop
[1:01:00] you everything he can he'll try to break
[1:01:04] you but by God's grace we may fail him
[1:01:09] but he's there amen I may fall but we
[1:01:13] got to keep getting up is that right so
[1:01:16] I want to look at Kingdom versus mind
[1:01:18] World On Assignment On Assignment now
[1:01:23] how many believes that you're here this
[1:01:24] morning at Word of Life own
[1:01:28] assignment a bunch of you are rest of
[1:01:31] y'all what about
[1:01:37] y'all I said that last part because I am
[1:01:40] 99.9% brother Donnie would have said
[1:01:42] that same
[1:01:44] thing every one of us should be here
[1:01:47] this morning on
[1:01:51] assignment you agree with that
[1:01:56] I want to go to Jeremiah 1 4 and
[1:02:01] 5 but before I go to Jeremiah you turn
[1:02:03] to Jeremiah 1 14 and5 I want to read a
[1:02:07] scripture here I want to show you
[1:02:08] something just just uh just a few
[1:02:10] seconds of time if we while you're
[1:02:12] turning there the Bible says in
[1:02:14] Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and the
[1:02:17] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[1:02:19] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:02:22] in Heavenly places where
[1:02:31] where now a lot of people doesn't think
[1:02:33] brother Harry it
[1:02:36] matters the world doesn't think it
[1:02:38] matters oh we just happened to come up
[1:02:40] this Earth and we're just floating here
[1:02:42] from this time to this world through the
[1:02:44] this we go from this church to that
[1:02:46] church maybe this home to that home you
[1:02:48] know I'm just up on this journey float
[1:02:50] through to the end of time oh no no no
[1:02:52] no that's not even scripture
[1:02:55] amen and they just float through this
[1:02:57] thing saying it doesn't even matter most
[1:03:00] people thinks I've talked to people
[1:03:01] where they say well all it really
[1:03:03] matters is the
[1:03:06] end because if you look at you look at
[1:03:09] football and baseball and NASCAR and all
[1:03:11] of that they only worry about the last
[1:03:13] lap I've seen people actually lead the
[1:03:15] whole the whole race and then on the
[1:03:17] last lap the second man jumps in front
[1:03:19] and wins the race that's right well it
[1:03:22] don't matter all that matters is the end
[1:03:24] but let me ask you this question if I
[1:03:27] could that is so far from the truth it I
[1:03:31] might understand the terminology that
[1:03:33] they're using but notice this I believe
[1:03:37] on on the word assignment and I'll show
[1:03:40] it to you in Scripture that your destiny
[1:03:43] is determined by your
[1:03:45] beginning just think of it now don't
[1:03:47] don't don't don't throw me out yet it's
[1:03:49] been it's been a while since I've been
[1:03:51] here so I still believe
[1:03:57] your
[1:03:58] destiny is determined by your
[1:04:02] beginning listen
[1:04:05] carefully brother brand made the
[1:04:07] statement said you'll never be the word
[1:04:10] at the
[1:04:11] end unless you were a thought in the
[1:04:17] beginning you'll never be the word at
[1:04:20] the end so the beginning does
[1:04:23] matter where I was in the beginning
[1:04:25] matters
[1:04:31] he just didn't get up one morning and
[1:04:33] yawn and stretch one so I think I'll
[1:04:34] just write brother Harry down
[1:04:36] today well oh you know today is such and
[1:04:39] such I think I'm just going to ride over
[1:04:41] uh you you know Brother Louie down today
[1:04:43] I I like him he's a good guy I'll just
[1:04:44] write his name no no no no we was in the
[1:04:48] very thoughts of the king of kings so my
[1:04:52] destiny has a had something to do with
[1:04:55] my with my my my beginning a end had
[1:04:58] something to do with my beginning where
[1:05:01] I was in the beginning so I come here
[1:05:04] and he places me and he places you up on
[1:05:07] an
[1:05:08] assignment that you and I are supposed
[1:05:10] to
[1:05:12] fulfill when Paul teaches us here in
[1:05:14] Ephesians 1:3 and I got it all the way
[1:05:16] to 110 and I won't read it the same time
[1:05:17] and you can read it later Ephesians 1:2
[1:05:19] all the way to 10 Paul actually tells us
[1:05:22] here where our blessings lay and notice
[1:05:24] the scriptures here here he invites you
[1:05:27] and I to go back into
[1:05:31] eternity to see who we
[1:05:33] are he invites me and invites you to go
[1:05:36] back with him into
[1:05:39] eternity so this
[1:05:41] morning if I could I'd like to invite
[1:05:45] you as brother manam made said this in a
[1:05:48] message one
[1:05:49] morning he said I want to invite you so
[1:05:53] this morning I want to invite you
[1:05:57] to take a
[1:06:00] trip if you would
[1:06:03] go will you go with
[1:06:06] me Jeremiah 1:4 then you can have your
[1:06:10] seats then the word of the Lord came
[1:06:13] unto me
[1:06:15] saying this is such powerful
[1:06:18] scripture before I formed thee in the
[1:06:21] belly I knew
[1:06:23] thee and before the thou comest from out
[1:06:26] of the womb I sanctify
[1:06:29] thee and conjunction I ordain thee to be
[1:06:33] a prophet unto the nations may the Lord
[1:06:36] add His blessings to the reading of the
[1:06:38] word as you're seated this
[1:06:40] morning so the word formed me means to
[1:06:44] be
[1:06:45] fashioned means to be
[1:06:49] framed of divine
[1:06:53] activity listen carefully
[1:06:56] of
[1:06:58] individuals to be pre-ordained of a
[1:07:01] Divine
[1:07:02] Purpose to be
[1:07:06] predetermined to be formed so before I
[1:07:11] formed you he
[1:07:14] says in the
[1:07:16] belly I knew thee now these scriptures
[1:07:19] are so so powerful if we could just look
[1:07:21] at it and see it before thou comest out
[1:07:24] of the womb i s ified thee and
[1:07:27] conjunction I ordained thee to be a
[1:07:30] prophet so before he ever knew me he did
[1:07:34] this do you do you agree with that now
[1:07:37] watch this scripture as I can as I bring
[1:07:39] it to you just a few minutes of time
[1:07:41] this
[1:07:42] morning oh
[1:07:44] my so God's people upon the Earth were
[1:07:48] put on Earth for a purpose God actually
[1:07:51] gave each individual I don't care how
[1:07:54] old you are I don't care how young you
[1:07:55] are each person this morning sets in
[1:07:58] this building is here on an
[1:08:01] assignment now I'm sure you and I fail
[1:08:03] our assignment many
[1:08:05] times if you go to school and your
[1:08:08] teacher gives you an assignment you're
[1:08:10] going to have and you don't do that
[1:08:12] assignment you're going to get in
[1:08:13] trouble I know cuz I never done
[1:08:17] mine so kids don't do what I
[1:08:20] did if they gave me assignment Tim you
[1:08:23] need to go home and do this if it got
[1:08:25] done I was going to go see my cousin get
[1:08:27] her to do it for
[1:08:29] me I hated school didn't like it one bit
[1:08:33] didn't go half the time all I done was
[1:08:36] hunted and
[1:08:38] fished I'm not saying that's what y'all
[1:08:40] should do matter of fact if y'all do it
[1:08:42] your mom and daddy ought to beat
[1:08:49] you listen to this statement so if your
[1:08:52] teacher gives you a an assignment for
[1:08:55] you to do at home and you go home and
[1:08:56] you do everything else don't expect to
[1:09:00] pass don't expect to get into
[1:09:04] college not going to
[1:09:10] happen let me inject this here there was
[1:09:14] a poll taken and listen to this very
[1:09:15] carefully there was a poll taken in
[1:09:18] America
[1:09:21] 70% of people in America
[1:09:28] said they live their
[1:09:30] lives un deeply
[1:09:35] unsatisfied 70% of Americans said they
[1:09:39] live their lives deeply that's the words
[1:09:43] they used deeply unsatisfied now think
[1:09:46] about that seven out of 10
[1:09:52] people are unsatisfied brother Rob
[1:09:57] that's
[1:09:58] sad and we wonder why we have a state of
[1:10:01] depression in America we wonder why we
[1:10:04] have the problems we got in
[1:10:06] America when seven out of 10 people you
[1:10:09] meet every day are deeply unsatisfied
[1:10:13] with their life they don't know where to
[1:10:15] go they don't know what where to turn to
[1:10:17] they don't know what to say they don't
[1:10:19] know what to do they don't know
[1:10:20] nothing you know why because seven out
[1:10:24] of those 10 people hasn't got in touch
[1:10:26] with God to find out what their
[1:10:28] assignment was upon this Earth you're
[1:10:31] not here just to fill a bu PL you're not
[1:10:34] here just to come and clap your hands
[1:10:36] there's a specific assignment that God
[1:10:38] has given his
[1:10:39] children and the world don't know
[1:10:42] nothing about it sure the world has
[1:10:44] assignments sure that they they feel
[1:10:46] like they have something a lot of
[1:10:48] Christians in in denomination Realms
[1:10:50] feel like they have something that they
[1:10:51] are put on this Earth to do there's
[1:10:53] nothing wrong with that but think about
[1:10:55] the seven out of 10 that lives deeply
[1:10:58] unsatisfied the richest nation in the
[1:11:02] world and they're
[1:11:07] unsatisfied they can't seem to find a
[1:11:12] happiness I know wealthy wealthy folks
[1:11:15] that are sadder than every than I
[1:11:19] am got money coming out their ears
[1:11:22] that's right and unsatisfied
[1:11:26] go buy anything they want all kind of
[1:11:28] stuff and they're still
[1:11:31] unsatisfied why because they don't know
[1:11:34] why they are
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:40] here oh
[1:11:42] my when we realize that we're God's
[1:11:45] children and he put us on this Earth for
[1:11:47] a reason then he just don't put you here
[1:11:49] just to be here he don't put you here
[1:11:52] just for just just I just put Tim on the
[1:11:55] Earth and I just put Harry there and I
[1:11:57] just put Rob there and I just put this
[1:11:58] in here there has to be an assignment
[1:12:00] that you are here for there's got to be
[1:12:03] something that he's placed me here for I
[1:12:06] can take you from Genesis to Revelations
[1:12:08] and show you assignment at her
[1:12:09] assignment at assignment that God has
[1:12:12] placed the men of God in the Old
[1:12:14] Testament down through the New Testament
[1:12:16] he gave them assignments upon the
[1:12:20] Earth so if I can find that assignment
[1:12:23] then my life would be totally different
[1:12:25] if that seven out of 10 could find a
[1:12:28] hope and find a something that that that
[1:12:31] satisfies them they could find that part
[1:12:35] of Hope brother John and find something
[1:12:37] that gives them some some kind of Hope
[1:12:40] in their life then they would move them
[1:12:42] from that seven and put them in that
[1:12:44] other
[1:12:47] category children and kids of the world
[1:12:50] people that that they go to school and
[1:12:52] all this they don't have no hope
[1:13:02] 70% said they can't find a purpose on
[1:13:06] Earth but just think of that 70% if they
[1:13:09] could find a purpose on Earth while
[1:13:11] they're here how it would change the
[1:13:15] world it would turn this world upside
[1:13:22] down there's a reason the teacher gives
[1:13:24] you an assignment
[1:13:26] there's a reason the teacher gives you
[1:13:28] something to take home and
[1:13:32] do she's trying to learn you something
[1:13:34] and teach you
[1:13:37] something she don't give it to you just
[1:13:39] to just to be giving it to you she's
[1:13:41] giving it to you because there's
[1:13:42] something she wants you to learn there's
[1:13:45] something she what is she doing she's
[1:13:47] trying to get you ready for the journey
[1:13:50] that when you get out of school or get
[1:13:52] out of the college day you're moving
[1:13:54] into different era and the stage of your
[1:13:56] life then you then got to understand I
[1:13:59] know young people don't get this far A
[1:14:01] lot of times this is why it's so neat
[1:14:04] before the Holy Ghost right you and I
[1:14:07] cannot find our assignment without the
[1:14:09] Holy Ghost it's impossible for you to
[1:14:12] have where you want in this journey
[1:14:14] without the Holy Ghost and the sad part
[1:14:17] about it message churches that we
[1:14:18] believe that's in this message teach
[1:14:21] that you don't need the Holy Ghost no
[1:14:22] more we don't need him in the church no
[1:14:24] more
[1:14:26] what's happened to these
[1:14:28] ministers on
[1:14:36] now
[1:14:39] Hallelujah if we can get it figured out
[1:14:42] if our young people can get it fire
[1:14:43] figured out if our Elder people and our
[1:14:45] our middle age if we can get it figured
[1:14:48] out now Jeremiah was a major prophet so
[1:14:52] this verse of scripture is so powerful
[1:14:54] but notice this
[1:14:55] before Jeremiah ever got to Earth every
[1:14:58] before he was born he was already known
[1:15:01] of God that's
[1:15:05] right I love this part right
[1:15:08] here notice this before Jeremiah ever
[1:15:12] got to this part now the word Saint a
[1:15:14] formed watch
[1:15:16] this to be
[1:15:18] fashioned of divine
[1:15:23] creation to be pre-ordained to be
[1:15:26] predetermined to be formed to have a
[1:15:29] Divine
[1:15:31] Purpose so he knew Jeremiah before he
[1:15:34] formed him he Sanctified him before he
[1:15:38] before he was born he ordained him to be
[1:15:41] a prophet all before he ever stepped
[1:15:43] upon the
[1:15:45] Earth so before I ever showed upon earth
[1:15:48] oh I love this now before I ever showed
[1:15:52] up on the earth he knew me
[1:15:55] amen that's
[1:15:58] right W Hallelujah before I ever showed
[1:16:03] up on the birthing table he knew
[1:16:06] me before I ever came from my mother's
[1:16:09] womb he knew
[1:16:11] me it's one of the greatest debates in
[1:16:14] America today even in the last election
[1:16:16] three weeks ago that's right one of the
[1:16:18] greatest debates is when when in our
[1:16:20] country is when does Life Begin
[1:16:27] I like
[1:16:28] this you agree that's one of the
[1:16:30] greatest
[1:16:32] debates that's all that's all and I
[1:16:35] don't preach on politics I don't care if
[1:16:36] you're a Libertarian I don't care if
[1:16:38] you're a leftist I don't care if you're
[1:16:40] a rtis I don't care if you're a a a a a
[1:16:44] republican I don't care if you're a
[1:16:45] Democrat God can save all of you
[1:16:55] greatest debate in our country is when
[1:16:56] life does begin but my life didn't begin
[1:16:59] on the earth my life began
[1:17:02] [Applause]
[1:17:05] there well it it it it begins uh in 3
[1:17:08] weeks after the mother and father has a
[1:17:10] union or in one month or in two months
[1:17:12] or three months hogwash H beginning
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:18] Glory I just didn't H Hasley show up
[1:17:21] here on
[1:17:23] Earth so if that's the case then God
[1:17:26] must have a purpose for me God don't
[1:17:28] have to figure out something out what
[1:17:30] he's going to do oh my goodness Tim just
[1:17:31] showed up on the earth I got to go find
[1:17:33] something for him to
[1:17:34] do oh my goodness I didn't know I didn't
[1:17:37] know brother Harry was going to show up
[1:17:39] on Earth and boom bam there he is now I
[1:17:41] don't know what I'm going to do God knew
[1:17:44] before he ever showed up on Earth God
[1:17:47] knew Jeremiah before he was ever born on
[1:17:49] the birthing table he knew he he
[1:17:52] Sanctified him think of the word
[1:17:53] Sanctified he birthed him he Sanctified
[1:17:56] him he ordained him before he ever came
[1:17:58] on the earth to be a prophet of almighty
[1:18:03] God so because my life begin in
[1:18:07] heaven I am here oh I love this so my
[1:18:11] life began in heaven I'm here this
[1:18:13] morning you're here this morning to have
[1:18:16] a continuation of your life that was
[1:18:19] there upon this Earth
[1:18:29] and let's just be
[1:18:31] honest it don't matter how you got
[1:18:36] here the main thing is you're here
[1:18:38] that's

[1:18:43] ebike or rode a regular bike a walk it
[1:18:45] doesn't matter how you got here you're

[1:19:03] well my mom and daddy didn't want to
[1:19:04] have me and I'm a mistake it doesn't
[1:19:06] matter God Don't Make Mistakes don't
[1:19:09] tell me God didn't know that wasn't
[1:19:11] going to happen I don't believe that
[1:19:13] nonsense if he's God he's
[1:19:16] God if he's omnipotent and he knows all
[1:19:19] things and he knows all things
[1:19:26] then there's a reason for you to be here
[1:19:28] so in other words you are different I am
[1:19:31] different God's people are different
[1:19:34] we're supposed to be different we're not
[1:19:36] supposed to blend with the
[1:19:39] world I'm not supposed to blend with the
[1:19:45] world think about people in the world
[1:19:47] that's been given assignments that is
[1:19:49] not God's
[1:19:52] people they're not God's people but
[1:19:55] they've been given assignments there are
[1:19:57] people all on the planet that will
[1:19:58] fulfill the assignment that is not of
[1:20:01] God that's right Judas fulfilled an
[1:20:06] assignment so is so for 30 pieces of
[1:20:10] silver because he fulfilled assignment
[1:20:13] look at the characters look at the
[1:20:16] assignment down through the Bible
[1:20:17] there's a man reading the book of Isaiah
[1:20:19] one time and his name was Phillip and
[1:20:21] and and philli was assigned to go on a
[1:20:23] mission B tells the story how he just
[1:20:26] come out of convention instead he goes
[1:20:28] out there and God just moves upon him
[1:20:30] and gives him inspiration we find Philip
[1:20:33] 15 miles somewhere else talking to the
[1:20:37] unic what's he doing he's fulfilling an
[1:20:41] assignment Peter had an
[1:20:43] assignment brother bam had a great
[1:20:46] assignment look at Jacob there in
[1:20:48] Genesis 49 notice the scripture if you
[1:20:51] read it he's dying notice what he does
[1:20:53] he pulls his feet up watch this
[1:20:55] carefully he pulls his feet up go read
[1:20:57] Genesis 49 he pulls his feet up into the
[1:20:59] bed and he begin to give up the ghost
[1:21:01] the Bible tells
[1:21:05] us he be to line up the borders where
[1:21:08] every tribe would be in the land this is
[1:21:11] what the spir scripture is talking about

[1:21:49] place God don't forget his assignment

[1:28:58] didn't get
[1:29:01] that I mean my dad plays like brother
[1:29:03] Harry my dad gets off of that comes over
[1:29:06] here and gets on this jumps on the
[1:29:07] guitar I mean he just jumps on

[1:29:25] stand on and look at him I'm not mad at
[1:29:27] him that he can do that probably a
[1:29:30] little
[1:29:35] jealous but embrace the
[1:29:38] assignment that God has allotted you to
[1:29:43] have so I try to embrace me playing the
[1:29:46] guitar which I can't I try to embrace I
[1:29:49] didn't want to sing this morning I said
[1:29:51] y'all
[1:29:53] sing so now I am trying to embrace the
[1:29:58] organ I need you a couple hours at of
[1:30:01] church
[1:30:09] today if Heaven is behind you that's all
[1:30:13] you
[1:30:15] need if the Creator if the kingdom is
[1:30:18] behind you it's all you
[1:30:22] need now notice let's get into some of
[1:30:27] this If Heaven's behind you in your
[1:30:33] assignment you will not blend with the
[1:30:38] world heard a minister to other day
[1:30:40] talking about blending in we need to
[1:30:41] blend in with this and and blend in with
[1:30:43] this and I don't think you need to blend
[1:30:45] with the
[1:30:47] world I don't think you need to be mean
[1:30:49] to them I don't think you need to be
[1:30:51] hateful to the people that that don't
[1:30:52] believe this message that's the problem
[1:30:54] now with this message if you don't agree
[1:30:56] with me and I don't agree with you you
[1:30:57] know you don't dress exactly like I
[1:30:59] think you need to dress and if you don't
[1:31:00] wear your hair exactly of M I don't care
[1:31:03] it ain't my
[1:31:06] business that's why brother bam said
[1:31:08] when you get them to Jesus Christ let
[1:31:09] him clean
[1:31:12] it if brother Donnie or me cleans the
[1:31:15] people they they ain't going to
[1:31:17] stay that's
[1:31:21] right but if we can find the the right
[1:31:24] assignment that God's allotted for me to
[1:31:26] have not blending him with the world but
[1:31:29] yet be that part of the assignment that
[1:31:32] can help and help coach that person
[1:31:35] maybe give them some leadway here and
[1:31:37] there let them know about Jesus Christ
[1:31:39] let them know about this I have a guy
[1:31:41] works with me he's
[1:31:44] 33 he come to my company when he was 14
[1:31:48] maybe 15 dad kicked him out of his house
[1:31:52] didn't have no reason
[1:31:57] and uh work with a roofing crew and if
[1:31:59] you ever work with a roofing crew they
[1:32:01] probably I don't mean this no bad to
[1:32:03] roof and Cru cuz I'm a roofer myself
[1:32:05] roofers they are about the slouch people
[1:32:07] there
[1:32:09] is and I I don't mean that bad cuz I'm a
[1:32:12] roofer
[1:32:15] myself but I mean just no life this man

[1:32:20] this crew and they was all I mean it was
[1:32:22] just pure awful

[1:32:27] falls off of a ladder backer on one of
[1:32:29] our jobs messes his neck and his back up
[1:32:32] so he's out for three months they put
[1:32:34] him on light duty they put him back in
[1:32:35] in the shop and said won't you just do
[1:32:37] light light duty so I'm in there working
[1:32:39] one day and I need somebody to hold
[1:32:41] something so I just said hey I didn't
[1:32:42] know who he was didn't know his name
[1:32:44] didn't know about him I said hey come
[1:32:45] here and hold this so he started holding
[1:32:46] out well from that time on he stayed
[1:32:49] with
[1:32:50] me he's been with me 14 15 years now oh
[1:32:53] just me him and
[1:33:00] Tony now if you see this guy we call him
[1:33:04] tattoo
[1:33:05] boy he's eat up with
[1:33:10] tattoos but I'm going to tell you what
[1:33:12] he lay down his life for
[1:33:17] me 6 months ago we started going to
[1:33:21] church his family calls me and says I am
[1:33:24] so grateful for you and Tony that you
[1:33:27] got him away from who he was hanging
[1:33:28] around and said he has become a
[1:33:30] different person it's took me 15 years
[1:33:33] to get him in church now he's not in my
[1:33:37] church but he's in
[1:33:42] church he actually is pretty he
[1:33:46] everybody calls him my
[1:33:48] son he looks just like my youngest son
[1:33:51] Steven the one that plays the bass when
[1:33:52] he comes here
[1:33:54] everybody thinks he's my son but I'm
[1:33:56] going to tell you this guy is phenomenal
[1:34:00] would do anything for
[1:34:04] me instead of just throwing him away
[1:34:07] like I could
[1:34:08] have because he didn't look like
[1:34:11] me he didn't dress like
[1:34:14] me but I embraced this young boy that
[1:34:17] had no reason was kicked out at 15 or 16
[1:34:20] didn't finish school or nothing
[1:34:24] now I wouldn't get rid of him if
[1:34:26] somebody calls wantan him I tell him to
[1:34:27] leave him alone I will fight you over
[1:34:29] this
[1:34:31] boy
[1:34:37] amen oh
[1:34:39] my so I didn't I I don't blend in just
[1:34:44] fulfill the
[1:34:46] word when children of God are fulfilling
[1:34:49] the word you are on that assignment you
[1:34:52] as a child of God don't lose your
[1:34:56] identity don't blend in to the spot
[1:34:59] especially young people don't blend in
[1:35:01] to where you lose your identity blending
[1:35:04] in trying to make somebody else happy
[1:35:06] remember young people you've got an
[1:35:08] assignment
[1:35:12] amen you're a child of God don't lose
[1:35:15] your
[1:35:18] identity embrace the assignment that God
[1:35:22] has given you
[1:35:25] to each one of
[1:35:28] you now watch the word formed actually
[1:35:31] in the
[1:35:33] Hebrew it is derived from the process of
[1:35:35] a Potter and the clay so we're made out
[1:35:39] of the Dust of the earth is that right
[1:35:41] God said before I put you in the
[1:35:44] earth before I put you on the wheel
[1:35:47] before I put you in the
[1:35:49] spin and started making your body
[1:35:56] before male and female came together he
[1:35:59] said I knew
[1:36:02] you this word actually means to know or
[1:36:05] to be instructed to be revealed or to be
[1:36:08] declared to know and this is what I love
[1:36:10] here to know by experience in other
[1:36:13] words there is a known by knowledge and
[1:36:16] there is a known by
[1:36:19] experience there is a known by knowledge
[1:36:21] and a known by experience if I had an
[1:36:23] orange this morning and I had it in my
[1:36:26] hand and I took a big old bite of it and
[1:36:28] I begin to tell you man this thing is
[1:36:30] Juicy man this thing is so
[1:36:35] good I know it's good because I'm
[1:36:37] experiencing
[1:36:39] it you know it's good because of
[1:36:42] knowledge because when I eat an orange
[1:36:44] the juice runs down my
[1:36:47] elbow you would say man that thing must
[1:36:49] be good Tim's getting all in that thing
[1:36:51] juices everywhere
[1:36:54] but you wouldn't know how good it is
[1:36:57] right oh my but when I experience how
[1:37:01] good it
[1:37:03] is then I can tell you the taste is
[1:37:05] something
[1:37:08] else so God saiding I just didn't know
[1:37:11] you by
[1:37:12] knowledge come on I just don't know you
[1:37:15] Word of Life by knowledge I know you
[1:37:17] Word of Life by experience I had an
[1:37:20] experience with you before you ever got
[1:37:22] here amen
[1:37:29] amen I already knew you my experience so
[1:37:33] I was here listen to this so I was here
[1:37:36] before I was
[1:37:40] here I'll say it again I was here before
[1:37:43] I was
[1:37:45] here because brother Jim I have an
[1:37:48] Heavenly
[1:37:50] experience and my heavenly existence
[1:37:54] before I showed up on the Earth was
[1:37:56] there so now I've been placed upon the
[1:38:00] Earth let me say it this
[1:38:04] way when Jesus mentions this in the
[1:38:06] Kingdom there in the scriptures and he
[1:38:07] speaks of being lost notice
[1:38:10] this because I believe that we existed
[1:38:13] in heaven and we had the kingdom there
[1:38:16] this is why it's Kingdom versus the Mind
[1:38:19] world so if this is true listen
[1:38:22] carefully and I been
[1:38:24] lost means we were there at one
[1:38:29] time Jesus speaks of The Parables the
[1:38:32] coin lost the sun lost different
[1:38:36] Parables the boy was a son before he
[1:38:40] ever left
[1:38:42] home The Boy comes to his dad and says
[1:38:45] hey I want uh give me all that you owe
[1:38:47] me well here's $300,000 this is your
[1:38:50] part of the inheritance and he goes out
[1:38:52] and he wastes it on the Bible says
[1:38:54] rotness
[1:38:57] living now he he now at this time has
[1:39:00] got away from the assment that God has
[1:39:02] called him to do the other boy is at
[1:39:05] home and he's fulfilling everything his
[1:39:06] daddy wants he's doing this he's staying
[1:39:08] right true with his daddy he's mad at
[1:39:10] his daddy cuz he got to stay at home to
[1:39:12] get his $300,000 and his his brother got
[1:39:14] $300,000 cuz he left went out and just
[1:39:16] spent it and lived any way he wanted
[1:39:19] to but the boy was a son before he ever
[1:39:22] did that amen amen God didn't throw him
[1:39:26] away the daddy didn't throw him away the
[1:39:29] Bible says that when the boy found out
[1:39:31] and realized who he was and what he was
[1:39:33] doing he was in a pig pin and he was
[1:39:36] eating with the pig pin of the husk of
[1:39:38] the Hogs and he come the Bible says he
[1:39:40] came to
[1:39:43] himself what did he do he run back home
[1:39:48] the daddy seen him and said go get the
[1:39:50] fatted cave get the ring get the
[1:39:52] everything ready we're going to have a
[1:39:54] celebration why because he's coming
[1:39:56] [Applause]
[1:39:58] back oh if I had time to preach on the
[1:40:00] word on the two letters r
[1:40:09] e so before I put you on the earth in a
[1:40:13] body I already knew you by
[1:40:15] experience before I was here I was here
[1:40:24] so I existed in heaven I had a part of
[1:40:26] the Kingdom I am a part of the
[1:40:29] Kingdom I was one time there so how can
[1:40:34] how can listen this how can I lose
[1:40:37] something that never was
[1:40:44] mine you can't lose something if he
[1:40:46] ain't never been
[1:40:51] yours the sun was lost the was
[1:40:55] lost it's something that we formerly
[1:40:58] had so we had it in heaven but once we
[1:41:01] entered the Earth we lost
[1:41:04] it I was in my right position in heaven
[1:41:08] when I was under the kingdom but when I
[1:41:10] entered into the Earth something
[1:41:12] happened and I lost it by the Garden of
[1:41:15] Eden experience I tell everybody we're
[1:41:18] not going back to a you know you hear
[1:41:19] people say boy I can't wait one day
[1:41:21] we're going to step back into the garden
[1:41:22] of even why we've got to go further than
[1:41:27] that sin was
[1:41:31] there sin was there that's
[1:41:34] time we got to go Sister Janet before
[1:41:36] there was
[1:41:39] time so it's something that we formerly
[1:41:42] had God already owned
[1:41:45] me so it come to the Earth and got all
[1:41:48] mixed up and all messed
[1:41:51] up you see what is doing he's bringing a
[1:41:54] Redemption the word re e oh if we could
[1:41:57] lay it down I'm fix to preach on it next
[1:41:58] Sunday at my place Jesus now brings it
[1:42:02] down to the Earth my kingdom come listen
[1:42:05] my will be done in earth as it is in
[1:42:08] heaven the greatest prayer ever
[1:42:11] prayed my will notice this my kingdom
[1:42:14] come my will be done in
[1:42:17] earth as it was in heaven why because
[1:42:21] that's where I was
[1:42:23] I was there he knew me there he
[1:42:26] experienced me
[1:42:29] there the kingdom is the spirit of God
[1:42:31] coming down to live inside of you you
[1:42:34] agree is there a literal kingdom yes
[1:42:36] there's going to be a kingdom but the
[1:42:38] kingdom now is God taking up residence
[1:42:40] inside of
[1:42:43] you so we live out the word on Earth as
[1:42:46] it was in
[1:42:48] heaven that's your assignment you live
[1:42:51] out the word on Earth as you did in
[1:42:54] heaven I had that in heaven but the fall
[1:42:57] of
[1:42:58] Man made me lose
[1:43:01] that notice the Bible say there's two
[1:43:03] trees in the garden one of them was life
[1:43:05] we know the other was
[1:43:08] knowledge good evil some of it was good
[1:43:12] some of it was bad knowledge some of it
[1:43:14] was bad knowledge some of it was good
[1:43:19] knowledge because if you look at the if
[1:43:22] you if if you look at knowledge if if
[1:43:24] you know something by knowledge that's
[1:43:27] totally different than knowing it by
[1:43:31] experience it's got to be by experience
[1:43:34] God didn't know me only by knowledge he
[1:43:37] known me be be by the experience that he
[1:43:40] had with me
[1:43:45] there so if I lost my keys or I lost my
[1:43:48] wallet it had to been mine in the first
[1:43:50] place in order for me to lose it right
[1:43:57] I think I said it at Happy Valley one
[1:43:58] time there it's difference in being
[1:43:59] created and being made made the word
[1:44:02] made means to be formed means The
[1:44:05] Potter's will he takes the clay and
[1:44:08] begins to form it into a body that's not
[1:44:12] created that's made notice the
[1:44:14] scriptures and blessed be the Goda of
[1:44:15] our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us
[1:44:18] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:44:21] places in Christ so according to this
[1:44:24] verse that I just read I don't have
[1:44:30] needs let that sink
[1:44:32] in according to this verse in Ephesians
[1:44:35] 1:3 you don't have
[1:44:39] needs
[1:44:45] listen boy I got some big eyes looking
[1:44:49] now listen to the scripture blessed be
[1:44:52] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[1:44:53] Christ who ha blessed us with all
[1:44:56] spiritual
[1:44:59] blessings so according to that verse I
[1:45:01] don't have needs everything's
[1:45:05] fulfilled so God ain't the problem I'm
[1:45:07] the
[1:45:10] problem brother Tim we have needs on
[1:45:13] this Earth that's why you got to come to
[1:45:14] church and get in that real that he
[1:45:17] supplies that need he's already supplied
[1:45:19] brother Ram told us he done did it
[1:45:21] that's right the scripture in Ephesians
[1:45:23] 1 three tells us he's done did it with
[1:45:24] all spiritual blessings not one not two
[1:45:27] not just some with all spiritual
[1:45:29] blessings in Heavenly places in
[1:45:34] Christ he's already met my needs the
[1:45:38] problem is brother Rob they're in
[1:45:39] another
[1:45:43] dimension so I've got to find some way
[1:45:45] to get in that Dimension to pull out the
[1:45:48] need that I've
[1:45:50] got brother M tells us over and over
[1:45:52] everything you need is already in you
[1:45:54] even the
[1:45:56] Rapture where in Heavenly places in
[1:46:00] Christ Jesus notice this according to as
[1:46:02] he has chosen Us in him before the
[1:46:05] foundation of the world that we should
[1:46:06] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:46:08] love having predestinated us under the
[1:46:11] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:46:13] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:46:15] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:46:17] of his grace wherein he hath made
[1:46:23] means highly
[1:46:28] favored means exerting his holy
[1:46:31] influence on
[1:46:33] you turns them to
[1:46:35] Christ gives them Christian V virtues
[1:46:39] this is what the word made means gives
[1:46:41] them Christian virtues the spiritual
[1:46:43] condition of one governed by the power
[1:46:45] of a divine grace means the token
[1:46:53] so everything I need so before I give
[1:46:55] you a body I had already created you
[1:46:57] before I give you a body I had already
[1:46:59] experienced
[1:47:05] you now I can't get all this out in one
[1:47:08] service
[1:47:09] today I've preached four I've preached
[1:47:12] eight services at home so in heaven I
[1:47:15] had the kingdom then I lost it when I
[1:47:18] came to Earth
[1:47:23] now he's got to bring the kingdom
[1:47:32] down so he brings it down notice his
[1:47:35] prayer that my will be done in on Earth
[1:47:38] as it is in
[1:47:40] heaven so now his Kingdom's here where
[1:47:43] is his kingdom I'm looking at his
[1:47:48] kingdom so in this Kingdom there's
[1:47:50] assignments that he's placed for each
[1:47:52] one of us to do in this Kingdom now will
[1:47:55] there be a kingdom sure there's going to
[1:47:56] be a kingdom but this morning we're
[1:47:58] looking at the
[1:48:00] Kingdom so he now brings the kingdoms
[1:48:03] down where was you prior of this you was
[1:48:05] in his mind you was in his
[1:48:07] thinking you are predestinated to be
[1:48:10] here so your life was not just random on
[1:48:13] the earth he was assigning you with an
[1:48:16] assignment upon the Earth you are a
[1:48:18] continuation from Heaven on the earth
[1:48:21] that you will go back not up on a Cloud
[1:48:24] Nine somewhere not on a cloud 10
[1:48:26] somewhere you only move 10 to 15 20 ft
[1:48:31] maybe we know that how by God sending a
[1:48:34] revelated prophet in the end time not
[1:48:37] just his words but he tied it with
[1:48:44] scripture
[1:48:46] so before you were born the word born
[1:48:50] here means wound wo m b e d so your life
[1:48:55] started in heaven not with your mother
[1:48:57] and father so before I put you on the
[1:49:00] Potter's will and made you a body or
[1:49:03] formed you a body I had already
[1:49:06] experienced you CU you were chosen in
[1:49:10] Christ when before the foundation of the
[1:49:12] world that's before
[1:49:17] Genesis so am my assignment upon this
[1:49:20] Earth
[1:49:24] he had already put his hands on me and
[1:49:26] marked me and set me aside before I ever
[1:49:29] showed up here this morning
[1:49:32] yes before you young people ever showed
[1:49:35] up at school or homeschooled whatever
[1:49:37] y'all go or wherever you go before you
[1:49:39] ever showed up whatever you do he
[1:49:41] already had placed his hands upon you
[1:49:43] and formed you and knew you and
[1:49:47] Sanctified
[1:49:49] you listen to the word here be before I
[1:49:53] wound you watch I Sanctified
[1:49:57] you means to become holy we know that
[1:50:01] sanctification sanctification brother
[1:50:03] Jim he just saves us sets us aside for
[1:50:06] service a holy life is that
[1:50:08] true but let's just be right before I
[1:50:11] close let's look at it in another Avenue
[1:50:13] that be all
[1:50:19] right it means to prepare
[1:50:22] are to
[1:50:25] dedicate just let me come out and say it
[1:50:27] this way actually the word Sanctified
[1:50:30] here in the scriptures that Jeremiah
[1:50:34] uses we know it's to be holy we believe
[1:50:37] in that I believe in Holiness y'all
[1:50:39] believe in
[1:50:41] Holiness but here's the thing with with
[1:50:43] with with being sanctification people
[1:50:45] believe
[1:50:46] that I watch How I say
[1:50:50] this the problem is church people is
[1:50:52] made Holiness is getting everything
[1:50:56] right bear with me now don't throw me
[1:50:58] out
[1:51:02] yet just bear with
[1:51:05] me well message people's done this too
[1:51:09] Pentecostal people's done this Holiness
[1:51:12] people's done
[1:51:13] this well Holiness is just getting
[1:51:16] everything
[1:51:20] right well if that's the case ain't none
[1:51:22] of us that's
[1:51:24] right there's got to be another version
[1:51:27] that's right not saying that we all live
[1:51:31] filthy lives I don't believe any of you
[1:51:32] in here desire to do
[1:51:35] that but if we go by that then we we're
[1:51:39] not holy
[1:51:40] right sanctification is a part of
[1:51:43] Holiness sure it is we can show you
[1:51:45] scripture all day long in it but let's
[1:51:46] look at it's like I told my church let's
[1:51:48] look at it in another Avenue then their
[1:51:50] eyes get this big around
[1:51:56] now listen
[1:52:00] carefully holy don't mean that you and I
[1:52:04] get everything right every day that's
[1:52:08] right boy I'm you you've heard boy he
[1:52:11] lives so holy go to work with
[1:52:17] him boy you know old brother so and so
[1:52:20] sister and so oh my they live so holy do
[1:52:24] you go home with
[1:52:26] them do you go to work with
[1:52:28] them do you see them going down the road
[1:52:30] when they're when the when when they're
[1:52:32] just chewing that person in front of
[1:52:34] them out that's
[1:52:35] right I don't want they just need to get
[1:52:37] out of my way I just got somewhere to
[1:52:42] go so you don't see that side of them
[1:52:46] now that don't mean that person's not
[1:52:47] living right it don't mean they're not
[1:52:49] saved it don't mean they're not full of
[1:52:51] the Holy Ghost it don't mean they're not
[1:52:53] converted it don't mean they're not born
[1:52:55] again get that out of your
[1:52:57] mind but look at the scripture that that
[1:53:00] that Jeremiah
[1:53:04] uses here's the thing if you and I can
[1:53:08] get everything right every day all the
[1:53:11] time we don't need Jesus Christ and we
[1:53:14] don't need this message and we don't
[1:53:16] even need to be here Harry play a song
[1:53:18] and let's go home and forget it
[1:53:24] but what y'all here
[1:53:26] for what y'all here
[1:53:29] for cuz you don't get everything right
[1:53:32] that's
[1:53:32] right well Tim why you hear cuz I don't
[1:53:35] get everything right
[1:53:38] amen get in front of me when I'm in a
[1:53:43] hurry and I know you ain't supposed to
[1:53:45] do it but I'll sit down on a horn in a
[1:53:47] minute you do that too God bless you man
[1:53:51] for being honest
[1:53:54] my wife says what you doing that for I
[1:53:55] said I've got somewhere to
[1:54:02] go if if if you and I were holy every
[1:54:05] day all the time everywhere we went then
[1:54:07] we wouldn't need Jesus Christ this
[1:54:08] morning you want to know what the word
[1:54:11] holy you want to know what this actually
[1:54:12] means Sanctified in this verse of
[1:54:15] scripture separate listen separate and
[1:54:20] other
[1:54:22] now right now it don't make no sense
[1:54:24] none of y'all does
[1:54:25] it separate and other stay with me for a
[1:54:31] second cuz if you don't get this part
[1:54:33] it's going to be hard to get the other
[1:54:34] part cuz I preached eight services on
[1:54:37] this so now I got to come back eight
[1:54:38] more times to finish
[1:54:40] this so before I put you on the potter's
[1:54:43] wheel I already had an experience with
[1:54:44] you I'm going through it quickly now you
[1:54:46] had the kingdom you were chosen in
[1:54:48] Christ before I ever said let there be
[1:54:49] light there you was before I put the
[1:54:52] clay in the womb and come forth to be
[1:54:55] fruitful I Sanctified you now I'm going
[1:54:58] explain what other it is now hold
[1:55:03] on so look at the place he put
[1:55:06] you so before I did all of that I put
[1:55:09] you in a place where you need to embrace
[1:55:11] your
[1:55:13] separateness and otherness you say that
[1:55:15] ain't words it is in my
[1:55:19] vocabulary so I have to embrace my
[1:55:23] separateness now all of y'all go home
[1:55:25] and look at up and see if that's real
[1:55:26] words won't
[1:55:27] you I don't know if it's real words or
[1:55:29] not it just sound fine to me so I just
[1:55:31] use
[1:55:33] it so I embrace my
[1:55:36] separateness and my
[1:55:39] otherness I'll explain it and that's
[1:55:42] it's so hard to
[1:55:45] do because most people can't pay the
[1:55:49] price of other
[1:55:59] the price of other means being
[1:56:03] alone unless you
[1:56:09] compromise the price of other listen
[1:56:12] means being
[1:56:14] alone so people will compromise to have
[1:56:18] friends one of the greatest needs of
[1:56:21] humanity is needing
[1:56:24] somebody is that true how many people
[1:56:28] compromise what they actually
[1:56:30] believe to have friends that's right so
[1:56:34] I want to be
[1:56:36] accepted then I've got to compromise to
[1:56:40] be
[1:56:41] accepted so to be accepted that means
[1:56:44] I've got to become like
[1:56:47] them hold on hold on
[1:56:56] but here's the thing you don't know
[1:56:59] their
[1:57:01] assignment you're only you're only have
[1:57:05] to fulfill your assignment not their
[1:57:08] assignment that's
[1:57:09] right you don't know what their
[1:57:11] assignment is if their assignment isn't
[1:57:13] from God you don't need them in your
[1:57:16] life I'm talking about far as
[1:57:18] compromising I'm not saying you can't
[1:57:19] have
[1:57:20] friends if I be if I didn't have friends
[1:57:23] in the world I wouldn't have no
[1:57:24] friends most of the people hang around
[1:57:26] cuz I work so much they ain't even in
[1:57:28] the message but see what I have to do is
[1:57:31] not
[1:57:34] compromise I have to embrace the
[1:57:38] other why because it separates me which
[1:57:42] that's what the word Sanctified means in
[1:57:45] other words Jeremiah I have separated
[1:57:47] you from what everybody else was
[1:57:59] oh
[1:58:00] my so if their assignment isn't from God
[1:58:03] then it is of another
[1:58:07] spirit and that's where so many folks
[1:58:09] assignment is in a
[1:58:11] mess because people of that will mess up
[1:58:15] your
[1:58:18] assignment you know down deep in your
[1:58:20] heart what God's leading you and what
[1:58:21] God's got you to do in your life at
[1:58:24] times I'm I know you don't know every
[1:58:25] time and I don't neither and no man does
[1:58:28] that's
[1:58:29] Humanity but there's times in your life
[1:58:32] that you pray and you seek the will of
[1:58:33] God and God will you'll know which way
[1:58:35] to go but yet you'll find yourself going
[1:58:37] another way to please somebody
[1:58:43] else so don't compromise your other
[1:58:48] part because that part is the Holy Ghost
[1:58:53] don't compromise that part because of
[1:58:55] the
[1:58:57] world this why you are different notice
[1:59:00] the scripture Jesus said you are the
[1:59:01] salt of the earth and he said the salt
[1:59:04] that loses its saltiness is only good
[1:59:07] for the dung
[1:59:08] Heap now that's Jesus's own words I
[1:59:10] didn't say
[1:59:14] that so if he put you on the earth
[1:59:17] there's a reason and a purpose and
[1:59:19] assignment he sprinkled you with salt
[1:59:24] and if that salt don't make you
[1:59:26] different then you're no good to
[1:59:29] him if salt don't make me different then
[1:59:31] I'm no good to
[1:59:36] him I'm here to be around somebody to
[1:59:38] help make them
[1:59:41] thirsty so if I can feed them a little
[1:59:47] salt I know when you get when you eat a
[1:59:50] lot of salt you want to just drink water
[1:59:52] water and Pepsi and cola and all that
[1:59:53] stuff is that right believe me I put
[1:59:56] salt salt salt salt I put salt on I
[1:59:58] don't taste my food without salt it's it
[2:00:00] ain't food is no good without salt
[2:00:03] period everybody sits down at the table
[2:00:05] and say you ain't going to taste it
[2:00:06] first no cuz I know it's no
[2:00:08] good not till I put salt on
[2:00:13] it that's just the truth my wife says
[2:00:16] Tim you going to have a heart attack I
[2:00:19] mean I'll put salt
[2:00:24] that's what Jesus done to us he just
[2:00:26] sprinkled salt all over y'all now you
[2:00:29] make somebody else thirsty by the salt
[2:00:32] in your
[2:00:35] life so you don't you you be separate
[2:00:39] you be different but yet there's
[2:00:41] something about you that draws them
[2:00:43] in there's a there's a atmosphere and a
[2:00:47] spirit about you that pulls that person
[2:00:50] inise the Lord that you can make them
[2:00:52] salty thank you
[2:00:55] Lord that you're able to fulfill your
[2:01:02] assignment notice
[2:01:06] this
[2:01:10] Sanctified
[2:01:12] to be
[2:01:15] different now this is the word that
[2:01:17] Jeremiah
[2:01:20] uses to be
[2:01:23] separate to be
[2:01:26] aart from
[2:01:28] other there's not but two
[2:01:33] Spirits look at the word
[2:01:35] ordained to give or to bestow to
[2:01:41] entrust to
[2:01:43] set an
[2:01:45] appointment are an
[2:01:48] assignment so Jeremiah
[2:01:53] before any of this ever happened I knew
[2:01:57] you I have set you aside I've set you
[2:02:02] separateness I've set you over here
[2:02:04] you're
[2:02:05] different you're not a part of
[2:02:08] that and I have Sanctified
[2:02:11] you I have made you I have formed you I
[2:02:16] have ordained you and the word here
[2:02:19] means to give and
[2:02:27] assignment Jeremiah I didn't bring you
[2:02:29] to the Earth that you'd be like the
[2:02:31] world Jeremiah I didn't bring you here
[2:02:33] for you to be like so and so's
[2:02:37] Church Timber dad I didn't bring you
[2:02:39] down here that you can make your church
[2:02:40] like so and so's church and you could be
[2:02:42] like this and your people be like this I
[2:02:43] brought you here to set you aside
[2:02:49] right I brought you to the Earth to be
[2:02:51] different from all all
[2:02:54] this I brought you to be a Praying
[2:02:57] people a worshiping people and people
[2:02:58] set aside from other
[2:03:01] people to give an
[2:03:04] assignment notice in Ephesians 2:10 for
[2:03:07] we are his
[2:03:12] workmanship means
[2:03:17] assignment created in Christ Jesus unto
[2:03:20] good works
[2:03:23] notice created in Christ Jesus under
[2:03:25] good works which God has ordained
[2:03:28] there's that word again that we should
[2:03:30] that we should walk in them so I'm born
[2:03:33] in the
[2:03:35] earth he wound me in the
[2:03:39] Earth but before he ever did that he
[2:03:41] knew me there and sent me here to have
[2:03:44] an assignment to worship to praise
[2:03:49] amen so when did he prep prepare
[2:03:57] you before you got
[2:04:01] here that you should walk in
[2:04:06] them we go through
[2:04:10] Seasons but the season was there before
[2:04:12] you got to the
[2:04:15] season he tells he tells uh where's my
[2:04:18] scripture I won't read all that
[2:04:19] scripture there
[2:04:22] but he tells he tells
[2:04:25] Moses before I before behold I send an
[2:04:28] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[2:04:30] way to bring thee into the place which I
[2:04:32] have
[2:04:34] prepared I've done been
[2:04:36] there you're going there but I've done
[2:04:39] been there before
[2:04:40] you that you going to walk in
[2:04:46] them so before I'm
[2:04:50] closing be
[2:04:52] by the time the stars were hung I like
[2:04:55] this by the time the stars were hung
[2:04:58] everything that they needed to be there
[2:05:00] to support them was already
[2:05:04] there before the vegetation come upon
[2:05:07] this Earth every on on the ground
[2:05:09] everything was there to support the
[2:05:11] vegitation before the cattle was there
[2:05:14] everything the cattle needed was there
[2:05:15] to support
[2:05:17] it by the time we got here God knew what
[2:05:20] we needed to support us when we would
[2:05:22] get
[2:05:24] here he would knew that you would need a
[2:05:26] Sabbath age
[2:05:28] messenger he knew you would believe
[2:05:30] seven Church ages he knew you would go
[2:05:31] back and you would understand and you
[2:05:33] would see a lot of that and bring it up
[2:05:34] but he said I've got to have them one
[2:05:36] they've got to have somebody to support
[2:05:38] them they need something in their life
[2:05:41] in this Leto sin Church age that's going
[2:05:42] to be different than that it's going to
[2:05:45] be greater than
[2:05:47] that so before all of that he has
[2:05:50] prepared a prop Prophet to come on the
[2:05:52] scene the Bible says God ordered my
[2:05:55] footsteps he prepared my
[2:06:03] days so you step from season into
[2:06:06] another season into another season and
[2:06:09] before you step into those Seasons God's
[2:06:11] done prepared those Seasons that you're
[2:06:14] going to step into wow he knows you're G
[2:06:16] to step in that season praise the Lord
[2:06:18] so what you need in that season he's
[2:06:21] done put it there to support
[2:06:23] you he's not going to leave you that's
[2:06:26] right thank you Jes I know it feels like
[2:06:29] he's a million miles away from us many
[2:06:31] times but his word don't

[2:12:07] hear right every service you come
[2:12:10] through them doors you're responsible
[2:12:11] for
[2:12:17] it notice in Joshua 1:1 after the death
[2:12:20] of Moses the servant of the Lord it came
[2:12:21] to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua
[2:12:23] the son of nun Moses Minister saying
[2:12:25] Moses my servant's dead now therefore
[2:12:26] arise go over this Jordan thou all the
[2:12:28] people unto the land which I do give
[2:12:30] them even to the children of Israel
[2:12:32] every place that the soul of your feet
[2:12:34] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[2:12:38] you as I said unto Moses from the
[2:12:40] Wilderness of the Lebanon even to the
[2:12:42] Great River the river Euphrates all the
[2:12:44] land of the Hittites and the great sea
[2:12:46] toward the going down of the sun shall
[2:12:48] be your Coast there shall not be any man
[2:12:51] be able to stand before you all the days
[2:12:54] of thy
[2:12:55] life as I was with Moses so will I be
[2:12:58] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[2:12:59] forsake thee be strong and of good
[2:13:01] courage For unto the people shalt thou
[2:13:04] divide an inheritance of the land which
[2:13:06] I swear un to their fathers to give
[2:13:10] them oh my
[2:13:19] goodness he puts Moses on this
[2:13:22] assignment and let me say this before I
[2:13:25] close Moses had to get them out of Egypt
[2:13:28] before he could get Egypt out of
[2:13:32] them Moses had to get them out of Egypt
[2:13:35] before he could get Egypt out of
[2:13:41] them you see a man drowning you got to
[2:13:44] get the man out of the water before you
[2:13:45] get the water out of the man
[2:13:54] as long as they was in Egypt their
[2:13:57] assignment was fulfilling in Egypt they
[2:14:00] done everything that Egypt wanted the
[2:14:04] Pharaoh
[2:14:05] wanted but God come to a time where they
[2:14:08] cried and cried for deliver and God said
[2:14:10] these people are
[2:14:13] mine we know the whole story but we
[2:14:16] forget it often brother
[2:14:18] Harry these people are mine
[2:14:27] why did Philippians 2:5 say let this
[2:14:29] mind that was in Christ be also in you
[2:14:30] all not WR to be equal with God because
[2:14:32] he wanted to change our
[2:14:35] thinking got change my thinking he's got
[2:14:38] to change all y'all's thinking yes
[2:14:41] sir oh God what a
[2:14:46] promise listen friends Satan ain't
[2:14:49] afraid of the promise he's afraid of the
[2:14:53] manifestation of the promise brother
[2:14:55] John you can quote the promise all day
[2:14:58] long but now start manifesting the
[2:14:59] promise that's right what God promis God
[2:15:02] promise god promise manifest the promise
[2:15:04] right then Satan gets scared why because
[2:15:07] that's a part of the assignment that God
[2:15:09] give you manifest the promise it's in
[2:15:13] you you're the kingdom
[2:15:22] God help us you love him
[2:15:26] today he's good to us
[2:15:31] ay notice Deuteronomy 2:1 my this is so
[2:15:37] powerful Moses is in line to be the next
[2:15:42] king that's his
[2:15:44] assignment but God changes the whole
[2:15:49] mission ah
[2:15:52] when Moses was coexisting with Egypt
[2:15:55] they didn't have no problem with him why
[2:15:58] because he was basically compromising
[2:16:00] with
[2:16:02] them he wasn't being that
[2:16:06] other but when God said now it's
[2:16:09] time he goes out there and kills an
[2:16:11] Egyptian tries to do it all himself
[2:16:12] throws him off the mountain they take
[2:16:14] him put him on the back outa desert
[2:16:15] throws a stick with him God's changing
[2:16:18] his whole assignment around
[2:16:21] now he's been with Egypt now he's going
[2:16:24] against
[2:16:25] Egypt go against the devil and see what
[2:16:28] happens go against him quit walking
[2:16:31] beside
[2:16:33] him quit giving him room in your
[2:16:36] house quit giving him a
[2:16:40] bedroom see what he does to
[2:16:43] you that means you're moving into a
[2:16:45] different manifestation of your life yes
[2:16:51] and when he come against the enemy
[2:16:53] brother Harry his battle begin when his
[2:16:56] assignment changed notice Deuteronomy 1
[2:16:58] then we turned and took our journey into
[2:17:00] the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea
[2:17:01] as the Lord spake unto me we can pass
[2:17:03] Mount Syria many days and the Lord spake
[2:17:06] unto me saying you have compassed this
[2:17:09] mountain long enough turn you
[2:17:11] northward I feel like that's where we're
[2:17:14] at it's time to
