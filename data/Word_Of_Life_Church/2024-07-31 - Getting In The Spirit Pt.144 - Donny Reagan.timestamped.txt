[42:23] find there was never a Time
[42:29] [Applause]
[42:31] never a
[42:35] [Music]
[42:44] time how many can say Amen to that
[42:48] tonight there's been a lot of times I've
[42:50] been wondering where he was that which
[42:52] direction he went and that you'd like to
[42:54] hear from him even if it was just slap
[42:56] you up to side of the head but you know
[42:59] that he's always faithful he's always
[43:01] there to help us praise the Lord so GL
[43:05] see each one of you tonight grateful for
[43:06] the opportunity we can be gathered
[43:09] together on a Wednesday
[43:10] night to be able to Fellowship around
[43:14] the word and have fellowship with our
[43:16] brothers and sisters that we're going to
[43:17] spend eternity
[43:19] with let's turn to 1 Thessalonians
[43:22] chapter 4 verse 13 if you would Lord
[43:25] willing may be having U
[43:27] question answers again tomorrow
[43:31] night 1 Thessalonians
[43:35] 4:13 but I would not have you to be
[43:39] ignorant
[43:40] Brethren concerning them which are
[43:44] asleep that you sorrow not even as
[43:50] others which have no
[43:53] hope how
[43:56] sad for if we believe that Jesus died
[43:59] and rose
[44:00] again even so them also which sleep in
[44:04] Jesus will God bring with
[44:08] him for this we say unto you by the word
[44:13] of the Lord how could
[44:15] Paul presume to say
[44:19] this that he had the word of the
[44:24] Lord quite simple he knew he was a
[44:29] prophet now Peter never says this nor
[44:32] Matthew Mark Luke nor John Paul is the
[44:37] only one in the New
[44:39] Testament Lord willing I may not get to
[44:41] it tomorrow night but one of our youth
[44:44] had asked a question
[44:46] about prophets and how we believe that
[44:51] brother Brenham was a prophet and sent
[44:54] from God they wasn't debating it they
[44:56] just wanted to be able to explain it to
[44:58] other people but I had quite a time
[45:03] enjoyable time going all the way from
[45:06] the book of
[45:07] Genesis all the way through the Old
[45:10] Testament all the way through the new to
[45:12] the end of the book of
[45:14] Revelation looking at the word Prophet
[45:17] prophets
[45:19] prophesy
[45:21] prophesied the word of the Lord came to
[45:23] so and so the word of the Lord came to
[45:25] so and so I already believed it anyway
[45:29] but after I got done with that search I
[45:30] mean I really believed
[45:33] it but I imagine what people think
[45:35] honestly whenever they read stuff like
[45:38] this that don't believe in prophets and
[45:40] they think the law and the prophets were
[45:42] on to John and they quote that scripture
[45:45] and they think that means there are
[45:48] known prophets in the New
[45:51] Testament well if that is so Paul is a
[45:55] liar
[46:01] Ain none of us believe that are
[46:03] they why don't we believe that CU we
[46:06] believe he was a prophet a word Prophet
[46:10] this we say unto you by the word of the
[46:13] Lord now remember the word only comes to
[46:17] the prophet it can't come to me it can't
[46:19] come to brother Daryl and the rest of
[46:21] ministers here KN the rest of the
[46:23] ministers in the message the way it does
[46:25] a prophet that we which are alive and
[46:29] remain unto the coming of the
[46:31] Lord shall not prevent them which are
[46:37] asleep for the Lord
[46:39] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[46:44] shout an order
[46:48] command specifically a stimulating
[46:52] cry a signal is given to men
[46:57] a commander with a loud
[47:00] summons a trumpet
[47:03] call for the Lord himself shall descend
[47:06] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[47:08] of the
[47:09] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[47:12] the dead in Christ shall rise
[47:14] first then we which are alive and remain
[47:18] shall be
[47:20] caught
[47:22] up caught up catch up take up by force
[47:28] catch away to
[47:32] seize amen carry off by force claim for
[47:38] one's self
[47:41] eagerly to snatch out or away that's
[47:46] what we're waiting for to be snatched
[47:49] out that's right to be caught up praise
[47:52] the Lord then we which are alive and
[47:54] remain shall be caught up together with
[47:57] them in the
[48:00] clouds in the
[48:02] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[48:06] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[48:10] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[48:15] words how many wants to be ready for
[48:18] that great
[48:20] hour let's pray together you have a need
[48:23] something that you're petition before
[48:25] the Lord tonight just hold it to in your
[48:29] heart oh our blessed
[48:32] father it is our hope your Prophet told
[48:36] us in question and answers
[48:39] 1964 that far back that many years ago
[48:43] the only hope for the church is the
[48:47] coming of the Lord
[48:49] Jesus if he were alive tonight what
[48:53] would he
[48:54] say he was Brokenhearted whenever he was
[48:57] here how dark that it had got over the
[49:01] Earth and in that prophetic Realm by
[49:04] Vision as far as he could see was
[49:09] 1977 so by that he predicted not
[49:12] prophesied predicted that the Rapture
[49:15] would come by
[49:17] then so if that be true and we believe
[49:20] that it is then we have been in a place
[49:24] of Darkness that was so dark
[49:27] that even a prophet couldn't find no
[49:29] rays of
[49:31] light so from 77 on to
[49:36] 2024 it has been so
[49:39] dark it's no wonder Lord we feel so
[49:42] alone sometimes in this crazy world that
[49:46] we're
[49:47] living people around us have lost their
[49:51] minds the world was groping in Insanity
[49:54] in 1965 what
[49:57] are they tonight we can pretty well tell
[50:00] by the way they drive by the way they
[50:02] act by the way they
[50:05] dress they're not sure if they're a man
[50:07] a woman or a boy or a
[50:09] girl they just don't know anymore
[50:12] Lord thank you for
[50:14] light thank you for Grace on our
[50:17] lives oh Jesus we're not here tonight to
[50:20] stick our noses up in the air as it were
[50:22] and say look at us but we're here to Bow
[50:25] our heads to the death of the earth and
[50:27] say thank you for
[50:29] Grace thank you for your grace on our
[50:32] lives speak to us tonight from your word
[50:35] father and we pray as you told us to
[50:38] pray pray you therefore always that you
[50:40] may be accounted worthy to escape all
[50:42] these things that shall come to pass and
[50:45] stand before the son of man Grant it
[50:49] tonight father in Jesus name we pray
[50:52] amen God bless you Saints you may be
[50:56] seated
[51:00] 1 Corinthians
[51:03] 15:54 so when this corruptible shall
[51:05] have put
[51:06] on
[51:08] incorruption and this Mortal shall put
[51:11] on
[51:13] immortality then shall be brought to
[51:15] pass the
[51:16] saying that is written death is
[51:20] swallowed up in Victory I know I
[51:23] commented on it last Wednesday night but
[51:25] it is so great I want to comment on it
[51:27] again that that scripture not being
[51:31] fulfilled
[51:32] completely in the days of the Lord Jesus
[51:36] himself whenever he raised and when all
[51:39] of those Saints of Matthew
[51:41] 27:53 were raised from the dead and yet
[51:45] this scripture will be fulfilled in its
[51:49] completion not even in the Millennium
[51:52] now remember the Millennium will begin
[51:55] with a great res
[51:57] Resurrection there will be millions of
[52:00] people that will be raised in the
[52:03] Millennium not in glorified bodies but
[52:06] in human bodies you may wonder sometimes
[52:09] where part of the aborted babies will be
[52:14] now remember they never had a chance to
[52:16] choose no doubt they will come up in the
[52:19] Millennium those who never had the
[52:22] opportunity to hear God kept them from
[52:25] hearing if you can understand that they
[52:28] will be given the opportunity to make
[52:30] their choice in the Millennium not under
[52:33] the dispensation of Son of God which is
[52:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost not under the
[52:39] dispensation of son of man which is
[52:42] prophetic but under the dispensation of
[52:44] the son of David they will be given the
[52:47] opportunity to make up their mind in the
[52:50] millenum I know it may may be nearly
[52:52] impossible for us to comprehend that
[52:54] anybody in the right mind would choose
[52:58] not to serve him people will no longer
[53:01] be dying people will be constantly
[53:04] renewing their youth people will be
[53:07] living for a thousand years people will
[53:11] be made of course not to war there will
[53:15] be no more battles no more fussing no
[53:19] more arguing no more fighting none of
[53:21] that sort of thing it'll be under the
[53:24] davidic reign of Jesus as the son of
[53:27] David and yet at the end of that Reign
[53:31] millions of people they may have
[53:34] subjected themselves under his Reign but
[53:38] at the end of that when Satan will be
[53:39] loosed out of his prison for a little
[53:42] season they will choose to follow the
[53:46] devil after living on the earth for a
[53:50] thousand years no one ever no one ever
[53:55] since the fall of Man man Adam lived to
[53:57] be 930 methusa 969 the oldest man we
[54:01] have recorded in history or in the Bible
[54:04] 969 years old no one ever Liv to be a
[54:07] thousand years but yet in the Millennium
[54:10] they will be given that opportunity and
[54:13] God will supernaturally raise them from
[54:15] the dead at the beginning of the
[54:18] Millennium and will sustain their
[54:21] Earthly bodies for a thousand years
[54:24] every day they will be living on the
[54:26] extended grace of God a reversal of old
[54:31] age they won't even be aging they won't
[54:34] be dying there'll be no hospitals
[54:36] there'll be no first aid there'll be
[54:38] nobody with a broken arm I mean those
[54:41] those things are just
[54:42] nonexistent the the the r the rivers
[54:45] that have been polluted have been
[54:47] poisoned will actually become alive
[54:49] whenever he stands upon the mount there
[54:51] and divides it from the hinder part and
[54:54] the lower part there will actually come
[54:56] a breaking forth of a stream which will
[54:58] run directly toward the Dead Sea and the
[55:02] Dead Sea will come alive the Dead Sea
[55:06] will have a resurrection the lowest
[55:08] place on the earth and Ezekiel even
[55:11] talks about the fish and going down
[55:13] there and they will pull fish from the
[55:16] Dead Sea any of you that's ever been
[55:17] there know no fish lives there so much
[55:20] salt content in the water that whenever
[55:23] you go there you can't drown
[55:26] you can't drown in the Red Sea when we
[55:28] were there several years ago many of the
[55:30] people that was there Carol different
[55:31] ones went down there well you can float
[55:34] like a bottle stopper on top of it
[55:35] because you can't go down the buoyancy
[55:38] that it gives you but they will exceed a
[55:42] resurrection of the Dead Sea they will
[55:45] see such phenomenal things every day of
[55:49] their life no Wars no no Mayors there
[55:53] ain't going to be no fussing and
[55:54] fighting no drunk drivers there'll be
[55:56] none of that sort of thing even existing
[55:59] and they'll see it every day they will
[56:01] be living in a place to where the word
[56:04] the weather will absolutely be perfect
[56:07] the temperature will be absolutely
[56:09] phenomenal and it will be the sun will B
[56:12] would be seven times brighter than it is
[56:15] right now according to the book of
[56:16] Isaiah and the the waters will become so
[56:20] pure all the inhabitants of the earth
[56:23] and the knowledge of the Lord will cover
[56:25] the face of the sea as the waters do and
[56:29] there will be such a Time on the earth
[56:32] and they will live under this
[56:34] jurisdiction of the son of man and at
[56:37] the end of it they will say I hate you
[56:41] Jesus I hate you I hate your kingdom I
[56:45] hate this miracle stuff I hate
[56:48] everything you've done I'm going over
[56:51] with the
[56:52] devil you think how in the world can
[56:55] people do that and it shows you that the
[56:59] blessings of God Alone will never change
[57:03] people's lives living for a thousand
[57:06] years will not change their perception
[57:10] of who he is and yet look at the
[57:12] contrast between them and
[57:16] you so you're born Immortal from the day
[57:19] you start your life you struggle some of
[57:22] you have struggled from day one when you
[57:25] become a
[57:26] Christian your family turned against you
[57:29] your your friends your loved ones you've
[57:32] been reproached you've been lied upon
[57:35] you've been ridiculed you've been called
[57:37] a cult you've been oh my the things that
[57:40] you've been through and serving the lord
[57:42] Jesus and you've got a greater
[57:44] determination to serve him than you've
[57:46] ever had in your life and he's not
[57:49] offering you a flowery bed of East he's
[57:51] not offering you a Garden of Eden he's
[57:54] not even telling you that all right I'm
[57:56] going to keep you you serve me and I'll
[57:57] keep you exempt from trouble from
[57:59] heartache from all that but he tells you
[58:01] if you serve me the world's going to
[58:03] hate you the devil's going to hate you
[58:05] when you get the Holy Ghost it's like a
[58:06] big Target gets put on your back and me
[58:10] knows what I'm talking about and it seem
[58:12] like everybody you talk to in the day
[58:14] and the hour that we're living they're
[58:16] just barely barely able to get over one
[58:19] trial and another one breaks loose and
[58:21] they get over one sickness and another
[58:23] one comes and they barely get over one
[58:26] trial till another one comes and yet the
[58:28] real children of God that are filled
[58:30] with the Holy Ghost they they know every
[58:32] day is bringing them closer to that
[58:35] coming or them getting ready to meet the
[58:37] Lord Jesus and look at these other
[58:39] people with that perfect setting an
[58:42] absolute Paradise on the earth that the
[58:46] world has never known and when it's said
[58:49] and done they'll turn their back on him
[58:52] and say away with you I don't want your
[58:56] Earth I don't want your kingdom I don't
[58:59] believe in you I don't love you Jesus I
[59:03] hate
[59:05] you well I'm personally glad I can't
[59:09] relate to
[59:10] that I don't mind telling you since day
[59:13] one when I give my heart to God I've had
[59:16] ups and downs and ins and outs and
[59:18] battles and difficulties I've had people
[59:21] to lie on me my my greatest hurt is from
[59:23] Christians my greatest hurt is from
[59:26] message people my greatest wounds are
[59:28] from preachers but you know what I'm not
[59:31] serving God so everybody will love me
[59:34] I'm not serving God so everybody will
[59:36] like me I'm serving God because I've got
[59:39] a desire in my heart to serve it if
[59:43] people turn their back on me well you
[59:45] know what that's their fault and they're
[59:46] missing the opportunity to have a great
[59:48] friend because I could be a great
[59:50] friends so that's up to them you know
[59:52] it's up to them I I've got a bunch of
[59:54] friends so you know what we it depends
[59:56] on our Outlook and what we're looking
[59:59] for I'm not looking for a flyy bed of
[1:00:01] East anybody with me tonight I'm not
[1:00:04] looking for the Lord Jesus to take all
[1:00:06] the stumbling blocks out in front of me
[1:00:08] and make it to where everybody will like
[1:00:10] me I'll tell you one thing if everybody
[1:00:12] like me I'd repent because I know I got
[1:00:14] a devil on me I wish somebody would help
[1:00:18] me preach tonight and you imagine living
[1:00:20] in a world like is fixing to come in
[1:00:22] that Millennium and people would turn
[1:00:25] away from me well to be honest with you
[1:00:27] I don't know how in the world people
[1:00:28] would turn away for him living in this
[1:00:30] world because if they ever have the
[1:00:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost and know the
[1:00:35] joy and the peace and the power that
[1:00:38] comes I I just can't say how they want
[1:00:40] to live for the devil one more day let
[1:00:42] me just remind you what the devil don't
[1:00:44] have to give you he don't have eternal
[1:00:47] life he don't have lasting Joy he don't
[1:00:50] have lasting peace he does not have a
[1:00:53] peace that passes understanding hey
[1:00:55] y'all come to have church tonight the
[1:00:57] devil ain't got nothing good to give you
[1:01:00] he ain't got nothing lasting to give you
[1:01:03] he ain't got a heaven to take you to he
[1:01:05] ain't got no crown for your head he
[1:01:08] ain't got no Water of Life no Tree of
[1:01:10] Life no bread of life well glory to God
[1:01:13] all he's got for you is hell every day
[1:01:16] and torment Hereafter but if you serve
[1:01:19] the Lord Jesus he said If any man will
[1:01:21] come after me let him take up his cross
[1:01:24] and follow me but then he turns right
[1:01:26] around and says the least that you if
[1:01:29] you do this unto me you've done them
[1:01:31] unto me I'll be your friend in trouble
[1:01:33] some time I'll be your burden Bearer

[1:01:53] everybody forsakes you what more could I
[1:01:56] ask for what why in the world would I'm
[1:01:59] going to trade the Lord Jesus for that
[1:02:01] line Low Down Rotten canive and sneaking
[1:02:04] cheating devil I don't want nothing to
[1:02:07] do with that Rascal anybody else here on
[1:02:09] the same side I'm
[1:02:17] on so just in case you're still
[1:02:19] wondering yes I am a fanatic for Jesus

[1:04:40] two of
[1:04:44] them brother Tony where did you get that
[1:04:47] the message Adam will reach over to Eve
[1:04:50] Eve will reach over to Abel Abel reach
[1:04:53] over to Seth
[1:04:57] so there will be nobody there is no body
[1:05:02] for
[1:05:03] Adam laying in the
[1:05:06] dust now maybe someone would have just
[1:05:09] had a funeral the day before the Rapture
[1:05:12] their body of course would still be
[1:05:14] there but Adam has been gone for so
[1:05:18] long you couldn't even find the
[1:05:21] dust so once the dust goes back to the
[1:05:24] Earth from when it
[1:05:26] came then it breaks back to acids and
[1:05:31] gases and then back to
[1:05:34] Spirit so where will Adam get his
[1:05:40] body where did he get it the first
[1:05:43] time now you see the problem that people
[1:05:46] have in trying to understand our
[1:05:49] Resurrection remember the resurrection
[1:05:51] of Matthew
[1:05:52] 27:53 was a needed visible
[1:05:56] Resurrection with multiple
[1:05:59] eyewitnesses so it could be written in
[1:06:01] the Bible it needed to be that type of
[1:06:05] Resurrection but our resurrection and
[1:06:09] Rapture does not need to be that type as
[1:06:14] a matter of fact it's going to be a
[1:06:17] total
[1:06:20] secret no one will know it for several
[1:06:24] days that it's been Global for some
[1:06:27] it'll be
[1:06:28] weeks now but we say well the graves
[1:06:31] will open symbolically yes mine's
[1:06:35] already opened spiritually I've come out
[1:06:39] from among the
[1:06:42] dead so my grave is already open praise
[1:06:46] the Lord but now what's the prophet when
[1:06:48] he breaks into this and God hiding in in
[1:06:51] Simplicity in Jeffersonville and he says
[1:06:54] that
[1:06:56] watch this when they say the graves will
[1:06:59] open how is the graves going to open I
[1:07:03] said I haven't got time to get into this
[1:07:05] I wanted to but I'm going to have to
[1:07:06] take it just to show you the Simplicity
[1:07:08] of God the calcium Poes everything when
[1:07:12] everything that's in you materials would
[1:07:14] only make a
[1:07:16] spoonful so a spoonful so when it would
[1:07:19] go through the cycle to where bones
[1:07:23] tissue whatever more would finally
[1:07:25] decompose and come back to the dust
[1:07:28] State you'd wind up being a teaspoon now
[1:07:31] some of you a little bit bigger maybe me
[1:07:33] and you might wind up being a tablespoon
[1:07:35] but that still ain't much to brag about
[1:07:36] is it so You' go back to that then after
[1:07:40] you would dissolve into that your house
[1:07:42] I mean then the dust would break up and
[1:07:47] it would become what it was before the
[1:07:49] Earth took on chemistry now there was a
[1:07:53] time that the Earth did not exist where
[1:07:57] was it though in the mind of God so the
[1:08:01] Earth was one of God's thoughts one of
[1:08:03] his attributes and then let's say that
[1:08:07] he started molding the Earth with the
[1:08:10] core and the cosmic lights and PES and
[1:08:13] petroleum and all those things that he
[1:08:15] wanted to make it out of so he started
[1:08:18] creating now the Earth is your mother in
[1:08:23] the sense of the body so God gave the
[1:08:26] Earth and it passes from one generation
[1:08:29] of the Earth this is why the Bible of
[1:08:30] course in the Book of Genesis says and
[1:08:32] these are the generations of the heavens
[1:08:36] and the Earth
[1:08:38] generations of the heavens and the Earth
[1:08:42] so the Earth was coming from one seed to
[1:08:46] another to another so it passed in
[1:08:49] stages and Moses called it as
[1:08:53] Generations so what was it it was in
[1:08:56] spirit it was invisible thought form
[1:08:59] then it come down maybe into a form that
[1:09:02] taken not a visible thing but it did not
[1:09:04] look like what we have now so it was a
[1:09:07] generation so we would say all right you
[1:09:09] take me and hay and then our father
[1:09:11] Harry and I is one generation Our
[1:09:13] Father's another generation his father's
[1:09:15] another generation his father another
[1:09:17] generation so then we come down from one
[1:09:20] to the other so the earth and the
[1:09:22] heavens was descending they were
[1:09:25] descending ending into the stage that
[1:09:27] they are now the generations of the
[1:09:28] heavens and the Earth and God was
[1:09:30] writing a story of you and I so the
[1:09:34] Stars passed in their genealogies from
[1:09:37] one generation to another and remember
[1:09:39] that God gave Abraham The Mystery of the
[1:09:42] stars and the Earth so he said look up
[1:09:44] there and he said count the stars that
[1:09:47] you see then he tells him go down the
[1:09:49] Sands and count that and that's your
[1:09:51] seed so from dust to Stars now it's
[1:09:56] written of course in the heavens and
[1:09:58] it's written on the earth then God
[1:10:01] brought the earth into its primeval
[1:10:04] state in the beginning God created the
[1:10:07] heavens and the Earth and the Earth was
[1:10:08] without form and void and darkness
[1:10:10] covered the face of the deep and the
[1:10:12] spirit of God said let there be light
[1:10:14] and there was light so in that stage the
[1:10:18] Earth something had happened in a
[1:10:20] cataclysmic State because according to
[1:10:22] Jeremiah that God when he made it he
[1:10:25] would have never left it in an
[1:10:27] uninhabited place in a state so God
[1:10:30] started molding and bringing to this
[1:10:33] state of what we are today same with our
[1:10:35] bodies so whenever we would go back say
[1:10:39] Adam Eve Abel Seth massusa all those
[1:10:42] that lived those thousands of years ago
[1:10:44] wh what would they be there wouldn't
[1:10:46] even be no dust left of their mortal
[1:10:50] remains so it would break back to acids
[1:10:53] and gases and then it would go back be
[1:10:55] on that it would go back to Spirit now
[1:10:57] notice that would be the Earth had God
[1:11:00] not sent a protected word you understand
[1:11:03] I took care the other day I said you
[1:11:04] know you realize that the earth and the
[1:11:06] inhabitants of the Earth have never been
[1:11:08] at the stage where they are now it has
[1:11:10] never been on the Earth where man had
[1:11:13] the power to totally annihilate his home
[1:11:18] it's never been to the spot to where man
[1:11:21] had the ability to totally annihilate
[1:11:25] his
[1:11:26] home and he would do it in this age but
[1:11:31] God has a protective word over this
[1:11:36] Earth this Earth is one of God's
[1:11:41] attributes and he will not allow it to
[1:11:45] be destroyed but it is in man's ability
[1:11:49] I heard it just a week or so ago that
[1:11:52] Iran was in a couple of weeks will have
[1:11:56] enough plutonium to make a nuclear
[1:12:01] warhead now remember it's not just the
[1:12:04] big ones that have it anymore the
[1:12:06] prophet said whenever he was here that
[1:12:08] many of those small Nations look at
[1:12:10] North Korea look at all these different
[1:12:13] nations and have it so they start
[1:12:14] sending them off if they do and it send
[1:12:17] it across the top from the from Russia
[1:12:20] across the top comes across Alaska we've
[1:12:22] only got so many minutes by the time it
[1:12:25] shows up on our radar they've got so
[1:12:29] many minutes from the White House now
[1:12:31] keep that in mind when our president has
[1:12:33] to go to bed at 8:00 at night because
[1:12:35] he's so wore out so hopefully Russia
[1:12:38] won't send it at
[1:12:40] 8:05 which it doesn't really matter to
[1:12:42] me anyway because I've got a first class
[1:12:44] ticket it don't matter what time it is
[1:12:48] so as a bride of Christ you can go down
[1:12:50] and sleep like a baby at night because
[1:12:52] you don't have to sit up and wait on
[1:12:54] that the way I look at it God's going to
[1:12:56] be up all night anyway there no need for
[1:12:58] both of us to stay up so if I can't
[1:13:01] trust him with that I sure can't trust
[1:13:02] him with My Soul but you think now that
[1:13:05] if God had not put a protective word
[1:13:08] over this Earth in this age man would
[1:13:11] annihilate same with you and I if God
[1:13:15] had not spoke a word about a bride in
[1:13:18] this age all the darkness all the sin
[1:13:21] all the everyday things that we deal in
[1:13:24] our life how many knows I'm talking
[1:13:25] about tonight just to keep your head
[1:13:28] above the water in the day that we're
[1:13:29] living you're an absolute walking
[1:13:31] Miracle right here tonight and Daniel
[1:13:34] prophesied and said it would be that way
[1:13:36] in this day that Satan would try to wear
[1:13:39] out the patience of the saints of God
[1:13:42] but God also spoke a word about you and
[1:13:47] that's why Satan will never stop you as
[1:13:50] a member of the body of Christ I'm glad
[1:13:53] for that tonight now I want you to think
[1:13:56] about that the Earth would be reversed
[1:13:59] and go back because Atomic power was
[1:14:02] released in the beginning when God said
[1:14:05] let there be and an atom bursted at the
[1:14:09] bursting of an atom the releasing of the
[1:14:12] atomic energy from the spoken word of
[1:14:14] God you see God is the only one that can
[1:14:16] be able to burst an atom and not produce
[1:14:19] nuclear fallout he knows what to do but
[1:14:22] man broke into his laboratory through
[1:14:25] Oppenheimer and all those men that broke
[1:14:27] into that but when they broke into it
[1:14:30] then they broke into the side of death
[1:14:33] they can't do with the same thing that
[1:14:36] God does and what would it do it would
[1:14:39] take this Earth Beyond dust it would
[1:14:42] take it back into gases and totally
[1:14:46] annihilate the whole thing but God said
[1:14:49] I refuse to let that happen I will
[1:14:54] redeem her she's the only planet whose
[1:14:59] name is written in the Book of
[1:15:04] Life show me the word Pluto in your
[1:15:08] Bible show me the word Mars in your
[1:15:12] Bible
[1:15:13] Saturn Uranus or any of the rest of them
[1:15:17] there's only one planet whose name is in
[1:15:21] the book of life and that is the Earth
[1:15:25] aren't you glad your name's written
[1:15:27] there
[1:15:28] too now sing so God knowed that in that
[1:15:33] first resurrection of Matthew 273
[1:15:36] 25753 there must be visible people come
[1:15:39] on the earth and sepes would open and
[1:15:42] they would raise and be Witnesses now
[1:15:45] watch he
[1:15:46] says God just speaks and the Rapture
[1:15:50] will come it ain't going to go out there
[1:15:52] and the angels come down and shovel the
[1:15:55] out the graves and get an old dead
[1:15:56] carcass here what is it it's born in sin
[1:15:59] but to begin with but it's a new one
[1:16:01] made in its rightness you know if we
[1:16:04] have this we'll die again nobody will
[1:16:06] say the graves will open the dead shall
[1:16:08] walk out that may be true but not open
[1:16:13] in the way you say open you see that's
[1:16:16] right it won't be like that it will be a
[1:16:20] secret because he said he had come like
[1:16:24] a SE and the night he's already told us
[1:16:26] this that the Rapture the judgments will
[1:16:28] strike sin plague sickness and
[1:16:30] everything and the people will cry for
[1:16:33] death to take them when the Judgment
[1:16:35] Lord why is this judgment upon us you
[1:16:37] said there'd be a Rapture he'll say it's
[1:16:40] already come and you didn't know it now
[1:16:44] why would they not know it they're
[1:16:48] listening to the wrong voices amen
[1:16:51] because the preachers that they're
[1:16:54] sitting under
[1:16:55] are telling them all you have to do is
[1:16:59] look to the cross and plead the blood of
[1:17:03] Jesus and he understands you can't live
[1:17:06] right he understands you've got to sin a
[1:17:09] little bit every day and he understands
[1:17:12] that the Holy Ghost was just for the
[1:17:15] apostles and we ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:17:18] no more well you know if that's what you
[1:17:21] hear and that's what you believe then
[1:17:24] naturally you're not going to seek the
[1:17:25] Holy Ghost and you know what's even to
[1:17:28] me more sad than that is that we've got
[1:17:30] a few preachers around this message that
[1:17:33] are teaching their congregations that
[1:17:36] there will be people out of the Catholic
[1:17:38] church out of the Baptist Church out of
[1:17:41] the Methodist Church that are going the
[1:17:43] Rapture on Resurrection morning I want
[1:17:47] somebody to show me where that is the
[1:17:51] conclusive teaching of this message down
[1:17:55] through the year
[1:17:58] 1965 you can stand right now if you got
[1:18:00] your quotes in with
[1:18:02] you amen it will take a message that
[1:18:08] will bring rapturing
[1:18:12] face how can you be a bride of Christ
[1:18:16] and wear the mark of a
[1:18:20] denomination when the mark of a
[1:18:23] denomination is the mark
[1:18:25] of the
[1:18:26] Beast and you pray to Mary in your
[1:18:29] rosary and you're going in the Rapture
[1:18:31] and God make us tow the line God make us
[1:18:36] I mean you do one little saying wrong
[1:18:38] think one little bad thought and you
[1:18:40] can't hardly live that day till you make
[1:18:42] that thing right and God lets people
[1:18:45] drink alcohol smoke cigarettes commit
[1:18:47] adultery where many skirts and dressed
[1:18:50] like like like men even though they're
[1:18:52] women and vice versa on the other side
[1:18:54] come on children and they're bringing
[1:18:57] drag shows to their church and them
[1:19:00] people are going in the Rapture if
[1:19:02] that's what heaven's going to be full of
[1:19:05] I don't even want to go come on don't
[1:19:08] get quiet on me tonight don't you worry
[1:19:10] there won't be no drag in heaven and
[1:19:13] there won't be none that's actually like
[1:19:15] it down here on the
[1:19:18] earth well praise the Lord so you see
[1:19:22] under the ministers that they're set
[1:19:24] under all we're all going we're all
[1:19:26] going you know everybody wants to go to
[1:19:28] heaven but nobody wants to die as the
[1:19:29] old song says and it's not just so much
[1:19:32] dying natural but it is spiritually so
[1:19:34] they will not expect it because they're
[1:19:36] anticipating the Rapture will be for
[1:19:39] anybody that believes in Jesus anybody
[1:19:41] that says oh yeah he's my savior I
[1:19:43] accepted him 75 years ago you know and I
[1:19:46] live like the devil but that's all right
[1:19:47] you know he give me Grace for that and
[1:19:49] that's just the way that it is so they
[1:19:50] don't believe in the Holy Ghost they
[1:19:52] don't seek the Holy Ghost and they live
[1:19:54] under that so they're just going in the
[1:19:55] in the coming of the Lord whenever it
[1:19:57] comes so they're not looking for it to
[1:19:59] be a mystery at all and no doubt they
[1:20:01] passed by the cemeteries and they say
[1:20:03] yep yep I can see all the graves other
[1:20:05] they're still
[1:20:06] full of all the people that I've buried
[1:20:09] since I've been here I could go to the
[1:20:12] cemeteries in Mount Carmel I could go to
[1:20:15] the ones all over Johnson City and
[1:20:19] Kingsport I could go to where we laid
[1:20:22] the body of my daughter the old Coke
[1:20:26] her grave will not be
[1:20:30] open because she is not
[1:20:35] there praise the Lord Brother Calvin
[1:20:39] ain't there come on your your husband
[1:20:42] your wife your daughter they're not
[1:20:44] there friends that's just the old
[1:20:49] cult now notice God hiding himself in
[1:20:52] Simplicity all it's it's already
[1:20:54] happened and you know it not why don't
[1:20:56] Believers believe the simple signs of
[1:20:59] his coming now they asked the Prophet
[1:21:01] this question in 1964 do all going the
[1:21:04] bride have to live within 15 excuse me
[1:21:09] 100 miles of the Tabernacle I believe I
[1:21:13] had that again last Sunday now in this
[1:21:16] know the bride doesn't have to be in any
[1:21:18] certain place many of them will be in
[1:21:20] the dust of the earth that'd be around
[1:21:23] the Earth in the snow and the North in
[1:21:26] the dust of the tropical jungles all
[1:21:29] around the world but when the trumpet of
[1:21:31] God shall sound the dead and Christ
[1:21:33] shall arise waken and Come Out of the
[1:21:35] Dust of the earth notice Out of the Dust
[1:21:40] God never made Adam's Body out of the
[1:21:43] red clay 6 Ines down beneath dust level
[1:21:47] where is the dust right on top right on
[1:21:51] top so God reached down on top where
[1:21:55] does God reach for all these millions of
[1:21:59] bodies that are going to be called from
[1:22:02] the earth the dust so he speaks at one
[1:22:06] time and how many ever there will be
[1:22:10] beginning with Adam from Adam Eve Abel
[1:22:14] Seth on down to the very last bride
[1:22:17] member that pass the day before the
[1:22:20] morning of can you imagine there may be
[1:22:22] somebody passed away that morning
[1:22:25] and about 15 minutes later they're
[1:22:26] raised from the dead said boy that was
[1:22:28] quick praise
[1:22:30] God hallelujah short sleep was it man
[1:22:33] that wasn't even a nap but God will
[1:22:38] speak not shovels Not Angels going down
[1:22:42] it will be a secret yes sir well how are
[1:22:45] we going to know his
[1:22:48] voice what dust will
[1:22:52] respond to the call
[1:22:55] now you see it will depend on you and I
[1:22:58] whether or not we are part of that
[1:23:00] number how do we know brother Brandon
[1:23:04] when he was there and Acton Kentucky
[1:23:06] when he preached at the campground and
[1:23:08] he preached Jesus with dirty feet was
[1:23:11] the subject that he was dealing with in
[1:23:14] 1955 and sister Nelly and brother
[1:23:16] Charlie and sister Nelly was there and
[1:23:18] brother Charlie wasn't serving the lord
[1:23:19] yet sister Nelly wasn't either but boy
[1:23:21] in that service the Lord got a hold to
[1:23:23] them s Nelly went up and you know cried
[1:23:26] and prayed and really give a heart to
[1:23:27] the Lord and the Lord just really done a
[1:23:30] work in their heart I was there several
[1:23:32] years ago on a tent meeting actually
[1:23:33] that brother Charlie set up on that same
[1:23:36] uh same ground where brother brandom was
[1:23:39] but brother Charlie after that the Lord
[1:23:41] started dealing with him and deal he was
[1:23:43] working night night shift there in in a
[1:23:45] place in camville and the Lord started
[1:23:48] dealing with him real real hard one
[1:23:50] night and brother Charlie just kind of
[1:23:52] sneaked you know went off around behind
[1:23:54] away from the guys he's working with and
[1:23:56] just kind of settled it right there with
[1:23:58] the Lord and then the next Sunday he
[1:24:01] went to the Tabernacle and he he did the
[1:24:03] traditional thing and know G up front
[1:24:06] and went up and so brother Ram told him
[1:24:08] later he said
[1:24:09] Charlie he said you made peace with him
[1:24:13] that night seen him in a vision and he
[1:24:16] said I saw you you know whatever it was
[1:24:18] where you standing and he said one day
[1:24:21] that same voice that called you right
[1:24:24] there at that plant will call you in the
[1:24:27] resurrection of the Rapture now you see
[1:24:31] this is our link to deity this is our
[1:24:36] link to the supernatural which God wants
[1:24:39] us to have our entire life our deposit
[1:24:44] our part of God the prophet says it this
[1:24:46] way a soul of God that was in God so
[1:24:52] just put it this way that God is a great
[1:24:56] Dynamo of
[1:24:58] Soul so you if you are part of him you
[1:25:02] were a soul of God that was in
[1:25:09] God I hope y'all come to have church
[1:25:11] tonight a soul of God that was in God
[1:25:15] that was your deposit then one day that
[1:25:19] part of God in you heard that voice of
[1:25:23] God
[1:25:24] and started pulling on your heart now
[1:25:28] this be honest we was not searching for
[1:25:30] God or you might have went from one
[1:25:31] Church to another after another but it
[1:25:33] was really God searching after us the
[1:25:36] prophet said no man seeks God but God
[1:25:39] seeks after man so there was something
[1:25:42] there that began to hear what was it it
[1:25:45] wasn't necessarily my physical ears or
[1:25:47] yours but it was that part from God that
[1:25:51] recognized his voice now if that part
[1:25:54] laying inside of me or laying inside of
[1:25:56] you was able to respond to that call and
[1:26:00] no doubt for some of you the state that
[1:26:02] you were in you thought there's no way
[1:26:04] I'm in such a bad shape I'm so lost how
[1:26:07] in the world could I ever come to God I
[1:26:09] don't feel worthy of course we were not
[1:26:11] but something within you begin to match
[1:26:15] up with something that it hurt it
[1:26:18] overwhelmed you as a matter of fact
[1:26:20] because it was beyond your own power
[1:26:23] your own choice your own capability of
[1:26:25] doing it what was it the father calling
[1:26:28] to a son or
[1:26:30] daughter that is the part of you that
[1:26:33] never sinned in the first place that is
[1:26:37] the part of God that was inside of you
[1:26:40] oh glory to God I got in trouble years
[1:26:43] ago when I first come to Happy Valley
[1:26:45] for preaching predestination and I'm
[1:26:48] still preaching it and still getting in
[1:26:49] trouble but you know what I believe it
[1:26:52] the way the Bible and the way this
[1:26:55] message teaches us that whenever I was
[1:26:57] born and when you was born that was the
[1:27:00] seed of God went inside of us hallelujah
[1:27:03] many of you can fellowship with me on
[1:27:06] this thought he said there was something
[1:27:08] in you when you were a little child he
[1:27:10] said there was things that seemed like
[1:27:12] it didn't bother other kids but it
[1:27:15] bothered you what was it it was your
[1:27:18] representation by
[1:27:19] predestination oh my when the devil
[1:27:22] thought he had us and we were so blind
[1:27:25] and so lost and so wretched but little
[1:27:28] did the poor old dumb devil know father
[1:27:31] had projected something down inside of
[1:27:33] us well I didn't just take the breath of
[1:27:36] life I took my own bro Hallelujah I took
[1:27:40] my own predestinated seat like that when
[1:27:43] I took the breath of life it would lay
[1:27:45] there I was one year old two years old 3
[1:27:48] years old at the age of 12 the spirit of
[1:27:51] God would start hovering over my heart I
[1:27:53] remember remember when it happened to me
[1:27:55] just like it was yesterday I was out at
[1:27:58] Mom's house my grandmother lived right
[1:27:59] by us in a house I don't know if I've
[1:28:01] ever told this public or not but I was
[1:28:03] out there in the yard and we were little
[1:28:05] old Reagans man we were redneck young
[1:28:07] ons I'm telling you what we didn't have
[1:28:09] high dollar toys we made toys we made
[1:28:11] our go-karts swung on grap Vines if you
[1:28:14] ever seen any heathens we was part of
[1:28:15] the Heathen Clan that's what we were but
[1:28:18] I'll never forget I was out there
[1:28:20] catching lightning bugs anybody know
[1:28:22] what lightning bugs are boy you kids

[1:28:26] let me tell you what you do you catch a
[1:28:27] lightning bug Firefly if you wish to
[1:28:30] call it that and you drop it down in a
[1:28:32] jar and then you keep them then what you
[1:28:33] try to do is get a little piece of
[1:28:35] thread and you tie around you know them
[1:28:38] little guys that June bug is a lot
[1:28:40] easier to tie around their leg but every
[1:28:42] now and then we'd try them little things
[1:28:44] you couldn't hardly do it so we got to
[1:28:46] where we just put them in a half pint
[1:28:48] clear jar and we draw drop them little
[1:28:50] lightning bugs down and through there
[1:28:52] and then we'd walk around on the outside
[1:28:54] at night and say we had a
[1:28:56] lantern oh my you kids think you're
[1:28:59] having fun on the computer all day you

[1:29:13] you're really screaming like tarsam and
[1:29:15] you H the
[1:29:16] ground oh my and I remember being out
[1:29:20] there in front of mom's house I never

[1:29:25] and then Daddy would scare us but I
[1:29:26] never was really afraid at night we' go
[1:29:28] out and play and run and carry on at
[1:29:30] night time like we would at day but I
[1:29:32] remember been right to her you remember
[1:29:34] right in front of mom's house and that
[1:29:35] little old driveway that pulled in and
[1:29:37] all of a sudden I felt this
[1:29:46] presence it was my first experience with
[1:29:49] him
[1:29:56] Hallelujah I just it's like I walked
[1:29:59] into something how many's ever
[1:30:01] experienced it before I just walked into
[1:30:05] something and and it scared me cuz I
[1:30:08] never found nothing like it before and
[1:30:10] it wasn't but a few days after that I
[1:30:12] started talking to my mama cuz she' went
[1:30:14] to Revival and got
[1:30:17] saved little did I know it was my
[1:30:22] daddy it was my father mother hallelujah
[1:30:26] oh I got saved in that trinitarian
[1:30:28] church got baptized and titles you've
[1:30:30] heard a lot of my story Little did I
[1:30:33] know what Journey he had for me but that
[1:30:36] same thing that touched me then I have
[1:30:40] felt him countless of times since oh my
[1:30:44] I cannot wait till I walk into his
[1:30:47] divine presence that day oh hallelujah
[1:30:50] how many knows what I'm talking about
[1:30:52] and your experience is just as real to
[1:30:55] you maybe he met you out in a bar
[1:30:58] somewhere out in a barn or out in a pig
[1:31:00] lot wherever it was but brother it was
[1:31:03] sacred grounds wherever it was cuz there
[1:31:06] you met God for your first time
[1:31:09] something has already it the other day
[1:31:10] and the prophet talking about when he
[1:31:12] saw that there was a god out somewhere
[1:31:14] he didn't even know how to pray so he
[1:31:16] wrote God a letter imagine a man that's
[1:31:20] fixing to be Elijah and he didn't even
[1:31:22] know how to pray and he tacked his
[1:31:24] letter on a tree and then he thought
[1:31:26] well no I know I've I've seen him come
[1:31:28] through there he said and then he
[1:31:30] thought no no I've seen people pray so
[1:31:32] he went in a little Co shed and he knelt
[1:31:34] down and he seen a picture and people
[1:31:35] was holding their hands a certain way
[1:31:37] and he said sir I I've come to talk to
[1:31:40] you I'm I'm an awful guy I'm an awful
[1:31:43] guy and he said sir I I've heard people
[1:31:45] say you you talk to them and they he
[1:31:48] said sir can't you understand my
[1:31:50] language he said well maybe I hold my
[1:31:52] hands different you imagine
[1:31:55] a man being so a young man being so
[1:31:58] blind and so ignorant not even knowing
[1:32:01] how to
[1:32:02] pray but he had one of God's seeds in
[1:32:04] him oh hallelujah it's not all the do
[1:32:09] gooders and it's not all the holier than
[1:32:11] thou that Jesus found I'll tell you one
[1:32:13] thing when we get into heaven we're
[1:32:15] going to set down by some of the lowest
[1:32:18] people that ever walked on the earth
[1:32:20] some of them have been married a half a
[1:32:22] dozen time some of was so mean nobody
[1:32:25] wanted to marry him in the first place
[1:32:26] some of them was so low down there's
[1:32:28] Bootleggers there's Liars there's
[1:32:30] adulterers some of them was Hypocrites
[1:32:32] and Liars come on somebody but the grace
[1:32:35] of God reached down and got a hold of
[1:32:37] them and he saved them and he Sanctified
[1:32:40] them and he filled them with the Holy
[1:32:42] Ghost and they heard that same voice of
[1:32:45] Jesus sake come
[1:32:47] on come up children
[1:32:56] oh I wish right now I was out in the
[1:32:58] woods by
[1:33:00] myself but since I ain't I'll behave and
[1:33:04] finish my
[1:33:06] sermon watch
[1:33:08] this when the trumpet of God shall sound
[1:33:12] the dead and Christ shall
[1:33:14] arise
[1:33:16] waken Come Out of the Dust of the earth
[1:33:19] Come Out of the Dust of the earth not
[1:33:23] six foot
[1:33:25] deep
[1:33:28] dust it's all he
[1:33:31] needs no matter where they are now in
[1:33:35] this the resurrection will be a
[1:33:38] universal everywhere every creature on
[1:33:41] the ball of the earth that's in Christ
[1:33:44] will come forth with him when he comes
[1:33:46] no matter where they are just think in
[1:33:48] the days of the early
[1:33:50] Martyrs when those Christians were
[1:33:53] thrown in into the lion's den and those
[1:33:56] lions kill the Christians and eat up
[1:33:59] their bodies and yet they were scattered
[1:34:02] their bodies in the wastage of the
[1:34:06] Lions across a face of
[1:34:11] theirs you're made up of a substance
[1:34:13] that's unseen made
[1:34:17] material
[1:34:18] unseen
[1:34:20] made
[1:34:22] material unseen become visible and God
[1:34:27] will give that
[1:34:29] substance
[1:34:32] back my holy ghost in my body is my
[1:34:36] Assurance that I'll have one and I'll
[1:34:38] see him in my
[1:34:40] flesh job said I'll stand on the last
[1:34:43] days and in my flesh I'll see God though
[1:34:46] the skin worms consume me now you take a
[1:34:50] cell and you break it down from a cell
[1:34:53] and it comes into a cell in a
[1:34:57] Cell into an atom and to a
[1:35:01] MCU wow this sounds like a scientist
[1:35:04] talking don't it don't you understand
[1:35:08] this is not from the mind of a
[1:35:11] Kian this is a man of called called by
[1:35:14] the spirit of God to break into the
[1:35:17] original creation of human
[1:35:21] life Hallelujah
[1:35:24] come from a cell then a cell and a cell
[1:35:28] and into an atom and a molecule and on
[1:35:32] down like that finally it ends up into
[1:35:35] the
[1:35:36] Unseen and it goes from a natural
[1:35:39] something you put your hands on to gases
[1:35:43] from gases into acids acids into gasses
[1:35:48] and
[1:35:49] gases and on back like that
[1:35:53] till it finally winds up in one little
[1:35:56] thing and that
[1:35:58] is
[1:36:01] spirit and this Spirit who
[1:36:05] occupied these
[1:36:08] gases now say you've got gases in your
[1:36:11] body now element of oxygen nitrogen
[1:36:15] hydrogen right what is what is water H2O
[1:36:18] hydrogen
[1:36:20] oxygen and the Earth itself would be
[1:36:23] destroyed if God would have allowed it
[1:36:25] to be so the Earth would have become
[1:36:27] like our bodies
[1:36:30] nothing but God stopped that process on
[1:36:33] the earth and said you can only
[1:36:36] go this
[1:36:42] far and the spirit that occupied these
[1:36:46] gases now listen to this it might not
[1:36:51] be the same gasing
[1:36:55] but the features here's what matters
[1:37:00] friends it don't have to be the same
[1:37:03] oxygen the same nitrogen calcium
[1:37:07] phosphorus phosphate on and on and on
[1:37:11] what matters is the
[1:37:16] image praise be to
[1:37:19] God but the features of what you are
[1:37:23] will be
[1:37:24] exactly what they are
[1:37:27] again the spirit has control
[1:37:33] that I actually had to come through
[1:37:37] physically Dawn and Betty
[1:37:41] Reagan I could not have been born into
[1:37:44] the Arrowwood family nothing against
[1:37:46] that family probably better family and
[1:37:47] what I come from maybe you could not
[1:37:50] have been born a Reagan you could not
[1:37:52] have been born a Smith or born a McGill
[1:37:55] cuty or
[1:37:57] whatever but God put so much brass and
[1:38:00] so much copper and so much iron in the
[1:38:03] making of the bell and you had all that
[1:38:05] had to come together so in the
[1:38:10] resurrection you're going to look like
[1:38:12] you did when you was a young
[1:38:13] man a young
[1:38:17] woman well you said Brother D you
[1:38:20] mean oh no don't tell I'm going to look
[1:38:22] at like a again I'm I was thinking more
[1:38:24] like a Marilyn Monroe type uh no I don't
[1:38:26] think you want to look like her I don't
[1:38:29] think you want to go where she
[1:38:31] is you see we'll look at things so
[1:38:34] different the pretty ugly all that sort
[1:38:36] of thing no it it won't be there no more
[1:38:40] now watch and in other words when you
[1:38:42] become a young man or a young
[1:38:45] woman
[1:38:47] wow
[1:38:49] God takes a picture of you
[1:38:55] Smile
[1:39:00] everybody so God snapped your picture no
[1:39:04] matter how old and wrinkled how
[1:39:05] disfigured whatever it may be it will
[1:39:08] run right on down through and that body
[1:39:10] may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up
[1:39:15] by lines whatever it is but it was made
[1:39:17] up of gases 16 elements of the earth
[1:39:21] that was calcium potes petroleum Cosmic
[1:39:23] light and so forth all goes together to
[1:39:25] make up the body now no
[1:39:28] matter the whole
[1:39:30] Earth is filled with
[1:39:34] that but
[1:39:38] now this
[1:39:40] picture is the main
[1:39:43] thing now there's always been a
[1:39:46] book that father has
[1:39:49] guarded around his throne
[1:39:54] Satan was right next to him his
[1:39:56] right-and man to
[1:39:58] Fellowship he knew a lot of things head
[1:40:02] of the music department in heaven thy
[1:40:05] tablets and thy pipes were created in
[1:40:07] thee the D the day that thou was
[1:40:09] created so he loved music he still
[1:40:14] does but there was this this
[1:40:18] book and papa never would let him get
[1:40:21] close to it
[1:40:24] he's never yet to this day even seen
[1:40:28] page
[1:40:29] one Papa always guarded
[1:40:32] it and watched over
[1:40:36] it it was his family
[1:40:41] album so in his mind he
[1:40:44] went he's snapping a picture
[1:40:53] so where was it at where was it recorded
[1:40:56] in his
[1:40:58] mind so he saw every one of us every
[1:41:01] millions and millions of his elect he
[1:41:03] saw
[1:41:06] them oh glory to God can't you see the
[1:41:09] way he looks at death is so different
[1:41:11] than
[1:41:12] us what matters is the
[1:41:16] picture you see the picture becomes
[1:41:21] exposed the first light hits
[1:41:24] it the moment of our new
[1:41:29] birth it's like the light rays Break
[1:41:33] Forth from
[1:41:34] eternity on the seat of God and the
[1:41:37] exposure
[1:41:41] just and the image starts taking shape
[1:41:44] and
[1:41:46] form so what was it you didn't know I
[1:41:48] didn't know I still don't know exactly
[1:41:50] I'm I'm praying oh God help me to to be
[1:41:52] in your will we all are me Lord I want
[1:41:54] to be more than you will cuz we know
[1:41:56] sometimes it'll it'll change you know
[1:41:57] the Lord will change the direction the
[1:41:59] way he wants us to go so we're still
[1:42:00] we're still looking for that but the
[1:42:02] main thing is is this image this picture
[1:42:07] so this is why it does not have to be
[1:42:09] the same
[1:42:10] dust you see we we think the main thing
[1:42:15] is this dust
[1:42:17] oh this is what we touch this is what we
[1:42:20] love this is what we focused on this is
[1:42:23] we fellowshipped around and shook one
[1:42:25] another's hands and cried and prayed for
[1:42:27] one another and we think this is the
[1:42:29] main thing no this is not the main thing
[1:42:31] the main thing is the
[1:42:38] picture but now this picture is the main
[1:42:41] thing then in the
[1:42:44] resurrection those gases and
[1:42:46] things come right back into
[1:42:50] place and develops
[1:42:54] this
[1:42:55] picture
[1:42:57] again so for those who are already in
[1:43:00] the sixth Dimension and their
[1:43:02] theophany therefore what happens
[1:43:04] therefore if you've entered into
[1:43:05] theophany what happens you will bring
[1:43:08] your theophany to the Earth to pick up
[1:43:11] your redeemed body you will bring your
[1:43:14] theophany to the Earth and if you are
[1:43:17] still here you will take your body to
[1:43:21] meet your your the offering the
[1:43:25] resurrection and the Rapture is the
[1:43:28] developing of the
[1:43:30] pictures oh thank you Lord God the
[1:43:34] developing of the pictures that are
[1:43:37] being brought back into the realm of
[1:43:41] visibility praise be to
[1:43:44] God thank you Lord
[1:43:47] Jesus
[1:43:49] oh and if these things come right back
[1:43:51] into the place and develops this picture
[1:43:54] again now this
[1:43:55] picture was not taken when you was 16 or
[1:43:58] 18 or 20 years old at your
[1:44:03] best when was it
[1:44:05] taken before the foundation of the
[1:44:09] world and it was put in God's Great
[1:44:15] file now unlike
[1:44:19] Microsoft and Oracle and all these
[1:44:23] technologies that we've got in this day
[1:44:26] you've got a file saved over here and
[1:44:28] you've got a file saved the pictures
[1:44:30] over there and my you looked at it this
[1:44:32] morning and you go back to look at it
[1:44:34] tonight and it's
[1:44:37] gone and it says we cannot retrieve your
[1:44:40] file or your file has been corrupted you
[1:44:42] say oh no oh no that's years that's
[1:44:46] years of of of of pictures oh no oh
[1:44:51] no Satan cannot not corrupt these
[1:44:58] fils as we know what happened just a
[1:45:01] couple of weeks ago whenever a certain
[1:45:03] thing and all the mechanisms tied to
[1:45:05] Microsoft and all that and Delta could
[1:45:08] not fly American could not fly and You'
[1:45:11] heard about it why because somebody in
[1:45:14] the partnership of their fouls missed it
[1:45:16] all up so they couldn't do it oh I'll
[1:45:19] tell you one thing the devil thought he
[1:45:20] had it all messed up in the garden of
[1:45:23] Eden he started corrupting what he
[1:45:25] thought was the image but God kept a
[1:45:29] Master Copy he s oh Hallelujah he s
[1:45:34] there in the Garden of Eden boy I have
[1:45:36] messed up this whole program poor old
[1:45:39] dumb devil all he done was just work
[1:45:41] right in the permissive will of God and
[1:45:44] by every one of those children there
[1:45:46] will not be a one of them that will not
[1:45:49] be there that day come on children our
[1:45:52] our name our looks our identification
[1:45:56] has kept in the foul of the father there
[1:45:58] will not be one lost and when God
[1:46:02] releases those in the sixth Dimension
[1:46:05] and they come down to the Earth all of
[1:46:07] the sudden it's just like the instant
[1:46:09] Kodak pictures you remember them and
[1:46:12] they go right at the end of it and in a
[1:46:15] matter of seconds there's the
[1:46:19] image praise
[1:46:21] God but you see God knew better than to
[1:46:25] trust us with
[1:46:28] selfies so it wasn't me and
[1:46:34] you it was not me taking my picture or
[1:46:37] you taking
[1:46:39] yours he took
[1:46:42] it Oh Glory let me go a little bit
[1:46:45] farther can I listen this now the only
[1:46:49] thing it did was featured it self
[1:46:54] here for you to make your choice then
[1:46:59] you become a servant of God him for
[1:47:01] knowing it it makes him a redeemer as
[1:47:05] we've been through it then that picture
[1:47:07] is absolutely this is the
[1:47:11] negative the negative part of
[1:47:14] life is where you're living
[1:47:16] now and anything if there is a negative
[1:47:19] there's got to be a positive before
[1:47:21] there can be a negative therefore
[1:47:24] if this is a negative there's got to be
[1:47:25] a positive somewhere if this ain't the
[1:47:27] POS oh my the real thing this is only a
[1:47:31] foreshadow the real thing that is to
[1:47:33] come you got
[1:47:35] it you got
[1:47:37] it so I don't care what they would do
[1:47:42] with you they cannot
[1:47:45] destroy that
[1:47:48] profile that picture sir in God's Great
[1:47:52] Gallery up there thank
[1:47:58] you it cannot destroy
[1:48:01] it it's in
[1:48:04] heaven you could burn it up feed it to
[1:48:07] the liines do anyway you want to it'll
[1:48:09] come forth again just as sure as two
[1:48:14] twos is
[1:48:18] four just to sure as God spoke it it'll
[1:48:23] come forth so no matter
[1:48:28] where you
[1:48:30] are
[1:48:34] than and it will happen in a moment and
[1:48:39] a twinkling of an eye every ready tell
[1:48:41] you last Wednesday night a moment and a
[1:48:43] twinkling of an eye at most it's a
[1:48:47] measurement of time that is so
[1:48:50] small it cannot be
[1:48:56] divided quicker than you could do
[1:48:59] that you'll be
[1:49:02] changed and the positive will come
[1:49:06] down and merge into what was the
[1:49:09] negative and you will be changed in a
[1:49:13] moment in a twinkling of an
[1:49:17] eye let me read this to you more
[1:49:20] close I found these words to today I
[1:49:23] thought it was so wonderful when God's
[1:49:25] people begins to get back together
[1:49:28] there's Unity there's power and whenever
[1:49:31] God's people get together
[1:49:34] completely I believe the
[1:49:38] resurrection will take place
[1:49:42] then there will be a
[1:49:46] rapturing
[1:49:48] time a
[1:49:49] rapturing Time
[1:49:52] when the Holy Spirit begins to gather it
[1:49:55] up it'll be in the minority of course
[1:49:59] but there will be a
[1:50:01] great
[1:50:03] Gathering now in this rapturing time
[1:50:06] like this there'll have to come a time
[1:50:08] now that the
[1:50:09] bride that rejects the head part of the
[1:50:14] Bride will have to suffer for her
[1:50:18] rejection now listen to this
[1:50:21] carefully this shows there will be a
[1:50:23] people who've been around the message of
[1:50:25] the
[1:50:26] hour but before the Rapture they will
[1:50:30] actually
[1:50:32] turn against the head
[1:50:34] part of the
[1:50:39] message there will come a time now this
[1:50:42] bride that rejects the head part of the
[1:50:44] Bride will have to suffer for her
[1:50:47] rejection don't you
[1:50:48] see these people out here that's never
[1:50:51] heard it how can they suffer for their
[1:50:52] rejection they never heard it there will
[1:50:56] be an element of people around this
[1:50:57] message that will come up so far and
[1:51:01] right before the changing
[1:51:03] time they will reject it they will
[1:51:05] polish it up and make the message more
[1:51:09] presentable they'll take off the
[1:51:10] prophet's rough edges and you know his
[1:51:12] vernacular and all that sort of thing
[1:51:14] and polish it up for the day not
[1:51:17] realizing that when they do
[1:51:19] so when they do so they'll stand before
[1:51:23] God for adding to and taking away
[1:51:25] from and they will be
[1:51:29] rejected in this briad time because the
[1:51:32] gospel wasn't made plain to them back
[1:51:34] there it's made plain to you today you
[1:51:37] see it's plain it's done all those years
[1:51:39] in examples the seals open Church ages
[1:51:41] laid out everything like that it's so
[1:51:43] plain you can't miss it then if you
[1:51:46] fully rejected there's only one thing to
[1:51:50] do suffer for
[1:51:54] it Lord children don't set you in this
[1:51:57] church don't set you under the hospices
[1:51:59] of the message of the
[1:52:01] hour and turn it
[1:52:03] down let's stand together he takes his
[1:52:07] little boy Joseph down to see the armus
[1:52:09] day
[1:52:10] parade and he relates the going
[1:52:13] home in a similarity to this
[1:52:16] parade one day there will come a blast
[1:52:19] From Heaven the dead in Christ shall
[1:52:20] rise first them Old Testament Saints
[1:52:22] back Yonder who are waiting Will Blast
[1:52:25] forth and come out of their
[1:52:26] first and go into the
[1:52:29] resurrection and will drop right in line
[1:52:34] going into the
[1:52:36] sky now notice the Old Testament Saints
[1:52:39] will come out first those not included
[1:52:42] Matthew
[1:52:44] 27:53 oh my what a time well drop right
[1:52:48] in line going into the sky these old
[1:52:50] Mortal bodies be changed made like unto
[1:52:53] his own glorious body what a parade
[1:52:55] that'll be when it starts heavenward and
[1:52:58] some of these days and that rapturing
[1:53:01] time that lays
[1:53:04] ahead
[1:53:05] oh proudly displaying the blood of Jesus
[1:53:11] Christ upon their
[1:53:14] chests the message of
[1:53:18] God in the hour
[1:53:22] that they lived
[1:53:27] in so tell me how can you take a
[1:53:31] Rapture and not be a part of the message
[1:53:33] of
[1:53:34] God for the day you lived in when the
[1:53:37] word become
[1:53:39] blood and the word bled for you so when
[1:53:42] people reject the word of this day
[1:53:44] they're not rejecting a quote they're
[1:53:45] not rejecting you know just a message of
[1:53:47] a prophet they're rejecting Christ Jesus
[1:53:53] he divided himself his word
[1:53:56] dispensation so when they rejected
[1:53:58] Luther's message that was Christ in
[1:54:00] Luther's day Wesley's message Christ in
[1:54:03] that day amen tongues gifts restoration
[1:54:06] and Pentecost that was Christ in that
[1:54:09] day now the fullness of the godhead
[1:54:12] bodily has come back under the
[1:54:14] administration of the son of man they're
[1:54:15] not rejecting me they're not rejecting
[1:54:18] you they're not rejecting William random
[1:54:20] they're rejecting Christ
[1:54:22] Jesus and his revealed word in this hour
[1:54:27] the very thing they reject is the very
[1:54:30] thing we will rise to meet him in ploud
[1:54:34] proudly displaying on our chest the
[1:54:37] blood of Jesus Christ the bloody
[1:54:41] bleeding word dripping
[1:54:44] blood to wash the briide
[1:54:48] in and we'll display that on our chest
[1:54:52] the message of God for the hour we lived
[1:54:58] him God bless you
[1:55:01] Saints may God you help each of us we
[1:55:04] can be ready for that
[1:55:06] day let's B it if you
[1:55:12] would oh
[1:55:17] Father Lord as we
[1:55:21] all look look back through pictures
[1:55:25] of ourselves
[1:55:28] and every now and then somebody will
[1:55:30] send me something that my sisters or my
[1:55:33] brother Jamie will put on Facebook and
[1:55:37] it'll be
[1:55:38] us as little Reagans and maybe some of
[1:55:42] our school picturers or whatever
[1:55:46] more sister lyia Swanson had sent one
[1:55:49] the other day to
[1:55:50] Carol it was Brother David and his
[1:55:54] youngest son Josiah standing there at a
[1:55:56] certain
[1:55:58] spot there in Canada 10 years later
[1:56:02] there both of them were
[1:56:04] standing Josiah had grown up now a
[1:56:08] married
[1:56:09] man brother Dave his hair had turned
[1:56:13] colors getting some age in his
[1:56:17] face what a difference 10 years makes
[1:56:23] but Lord we're so
[1:56:26] grateful that that real picture is in
[1:56:29] your
[1:56:31] gallery thank you
[1:56:34] Father oh Jesus May every one of
[1:56:38] us make preparation and
[1:56:41] plans while those that are turning away
[1:56:44] from this great
[1:56:46] word preachers that are polishing it
[1:56:50] up Lord God I pray that you'd help us to
[1:56:54] realize it's not the message that needs
[1:56:57] polishing it's us that needs polishing
[1:57:00] by the
[1:57:02] message it's not us that needs to polish
[1:57:04] it up and made it make it more
[1:57:06] presentable to the world all but I
[1:57:08] realize it's always been that
[1:57:10] way many want to use the message as a
[1:57:13] springboard for
[1:57:14] themsel I pray myself nor this church
[1:57:19] will never turn into such a thing
[1:57:22] may we preach this message in its Purity
[1:57:25] and its
[1:57:27] power Lord God where you can always be
[1:57:29] among
[1:57:30] us we know there's one way to keep your
[1:57:33] Dynamics among
[1:57:35] us and that is to keep our mechanics
[1:57:39] straight because if we get off of the
[1:57:42] mechanics part you will not bless a
[1:57:46] lie nor will you bless arrogance or
[1:57:50] Pride so the mechanics is part of what
[1:57:53] we must do and then you will strike our
[1:57:57] mechanics with your
[1:58:01] Dynamics we've been given a promise the
[1:58:03] Dynamics of this church will be a
[1:58:05] refilling of the Holy
[1:58:07] Ghost that we've only worked it in a
[1:58:09] small
