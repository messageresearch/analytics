season we've already appreciate with all our hearts thank y'all for giving and thinking about us also brother Nathan Brian will be with us Wednesday night speaking for so we just will look forward to that let's turn today if you would first Kings chapter 19 first Kings chapter 19 let's read verse 2 I'm speak to you again today on mercy walked in and Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them have a setting of this of course is that he's killed all of our preachers I mean prophets pretty rough past her to set under Lenin they don't preach art he carries a big sword knows how to use it - so Jezebel now is taken her threat Elijah the anointing he's out from under the anointing which is a terrible place for a preacher to be so she makes these threats if I'm making on bow life as the life of one of them about tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to ver Shiva which belongs to Judah and left his servant - but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and requests it for himself that he might die and said it is enough now O Lord take away my life for I am NOT better than my father's I'd like to be remembered today as we pray also the church down in Manchester Tennessee where brother Carroll is a pastor there will be voting 11:30 our time probably before long for a pastor there so but the David Siler is there as well as some other brothers so we just want to pray that God's Will would be done today and let's just pray together over the word Heavenly Father we bring our needs before you today our lives our petitions father we're asking you to help us Lord Jesus as we look into your word we've gathered here as we do on Sunday mornings about this same time yet our needs are different than they were last week about this time others that are sick that wasn't sick within it others are facing things in their life that they wasn't facing last week a week ago even though these things may be surprises to us so not to you so we're asking that you would help us today you didn't promise this life would be easy but what you promised was that you would be with us and help us so we're asking Lord for every hand that was uplifted in the visible audience and those in the invisible audience that your presence would move for each one Lord I pray today that you would move Lord down in Manchester you see there but the Carol's going to be stepping down from the church there and several different ministers Lord their names have been brought up before the congregation and the congregation is going to vote and we're just asking Lord God that your will would be done we pray father that should help each individual there to be able to vote not as so much a political regime or the way this person would want them to or that one but Lord made a vote for the future of their church for the future of a godly assembly of a godly man a leader that you would choose Lord remember many many years ago father went to come here to for the people to vote on me coming Lord I was I was young and meaning them didn't know me very well Lord I was warned about coming here and even my closest friends if I asked me not to come but Lord God we look back and we realize mercy walked to him it was your grace maybe some of them wasn't even sure I'm not John know this guy and he's wild a buck he's crazies whatever but all of we believe that you worked it out and orchestrated it I mean oh you're still God today so we ask that you're a man would be put in there and as we approach the word we're asking that should help us today help me that I can get out of the way help me that I can be sensitive to the Holy Ghost Lord go arrest each of our salts bring him into the presence of Christ minister to every need father we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you saying she may be seated mercy can take on many different forms when it goes to walking in the lives of individuals sometimes it has human feet sometimes it's invisible to the human eye it will walk in physically it will walk in spiritually it will walk into a situation or it may walk into a condition yet it's always always beneficial for those when God sends it we have one of the saddest settings of the Old Testament when we look at this setting today of Elijah the scripture doesn't go into the direct detail that we know from the inspiration of the message of the hour that Elijah has now entered into a breakdown he's now had a spiritual breakdown as well as a nervous breakdown mentally psychologically physically he's at his wits end he doesn't know what to do he stood under a great anointing anybody who's ever been under a very great anointing knows it while you're under that and anointing you feel like you can do anything absolutely anything you feel like you can challenge any demon you can do pretty much anything that needs to be done before you but when that anointing is gone you feel like a total different person it's very hard for me to explain how that actually feels I loved being under the anointing I loved come then wanting to preach I loved the anointing to study I was under most of the day yesterday by the time I came to church last night I felt physically exhausted because I've been under the anointing so long for so many hours yesterday with the Lord putting His Word together I love it when it's that way physically it was yell preaching is a different type praying for the sick is a different time but I must say and be honest before you today I've never stood where this man that we've read about was standing he had declared that God was gone he had taken a stand and very few men have ever to had to make as far as a national stand be under such scrutiny to be hated by so many by the leaders of the time he was the man that God had chosen for the hour so misunderstood he was a mystic he was odd unusual different now because he chose to be but because God made him different and now he's made this great stand the anointing has moved on him he's killed these prophets he's called fire down out of heaven God sent down the great consuming sign of the vindication of the pillar fire and God has proved what the man has said to be the truth now once that commission is done the anointing backs off because humanly we cannot live under that we cannot take that anointing it would kill us eventually it would kill you you're not made humanly to live under your mind your mind I think a man would lose his mind to stay under the anointing and evitt ibly you're physically you would do it absolutely die you cannot take it when John saw him on the Isle of Patmos John fell at his feet as a dead man for those who stood under the anointing very long at all you know how exhausting and what it does so God sends the anointing and then he will take it and back it off a little bit now this is where Elijah is he stands there in the face of these false prophets with the anointing on him nods does not bother him being outnumbered doesn't bother him he doesn't bat an eyes at work but as soon as the anointing is gone he feels so vulnerable the Prophet tells us that he runs at the threat of one woman one woman with the anointing he stands they're invincible without the anointing it seems as if though he's nothing but a mere child just a baby a child helpless it's standing there thinking how in the world what have I done and it's during these times that a person is so vulnerable and so open and Satan of course knows this very well so Elijah goes into an opposite direction actually he hears the threats from Jezebel his servant goes with him so far but even in that he separates himself from his servant so that even his sir will not be able to tell the direction that he's gone he's covering all these trails behind him he's leaving himself to where they there's not gonna be anyone to know where he's gone where no one can betray him you feel very vulnerable in this type of the place as he moves and goes there the farther he goes away from people and the longer he goes out from under the anointing the more vulnerable he becomes and thoughts enter into his mind what have you done you made a fool out of yourself here you are they're gonna kill you so now he comes through the only source that he has left and that is of course Joel though as he enters into the presence of God he's so low that he begins to ask God to take his life now once you notice he's not praying to Satan and asking Satan to do it but he's going still to his master and asking God to take his life because he says I'm no better than my father's and now you see where I'm at but you know God still had something left for this great man a man it might have seemed as if though he was at the end of the road and God was done with him and he'd never be used by God again and we've all been there in our lives maybe not quite where Elijah was but he's in this spot to where that God knows the man really needs help you know there's times when rebukes or what we need there's times from sharp chastisement is what we need and there's other times when we need an angel with a soft hand sometimes mercy will walk in and he will anoint a servant of God he will cut you up one side and down the other you look like you've just left a butcher shop when you leave Church but there's other times you look like you're wrapped in memory foam from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet you are cushioned you are cushioned with angelic touches and caresses so really it's not for us to be able to say how mercy will walk in mercy will come sometimes as a wrestler as we looked at Jacob last night when Jacob needed not so much the angel with the softest hand but he needed one with the wrestlers touch and our lives we will contemplate where we are and we said well god I'm going to church and I need this and this and this and you and I both know that many times what we thought we need what won't we got at all but you know what God knew what we needed even though we didn't know ourselves and that's why I've learned myself not to so set it up in the in our own minds well I want this and I need this and if I don't get it this way I ain't going back you're setting yourself up for a bad fall we need to go and say gods you know what I need I don't even know what I mean I think I need this and that and the other but I could be totally wrong so I'm asking you give me mercy Lord give me mercy and may that mercy walk into my situation in the way that you know that I need it in first Kings 19 5 as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto Him arise and eat but let me break in on the outside of the book of Kings and let me pull first Kings through a Malakoff for Elijah and let this Malecha for Elijah enlighten us to more of an understanding of first Kings the prophetess assists men who did on the supernatural say in the presence of God when you see God's program turned down and you preach it and you try your best and you do everything that God tells you to do and they still walk away from it it's heartbreaking God Almighty has done enough you're in the Angeles temple here this week till laussane just said Oh to set them afire no wonder he said it'll be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment oh man this poor little fella skinny laying there and his gray hair hanging over his shoulder and God said my servant needs some rest God's mercy to this serpent he just laid him down on a bunch of weeds and he went to sleep I imagine there was 10,000 angels watching him sleep there's water surance that the believer has though the world turned him down yet God loves him the world may call you a Holy Roller they may call you a fanatic but if you're true to God there's one sure thing God loves you [Applause] and his angels are encamped about those who fear Him I'd imagine on every limb all around through the place were swarms of angels and God came down and he said mob poor little tired servant hey man he's so nervous and Torah he don't know what to do I want to pick out the angel standing here that has got the softest hands now if you would have been there that day and this was your prophet messenger of your day that you lived would you've been ashamed to have been identified with him would you would have looked at him and said you expect me to follow you and here you are running like a coward here you are asking God to kill you and you're the messenger and you expect me to follow you would you have given mercy or would you have give him harsh judgment all friends I want to see the way God sees I guarantee you one thing the greatest desire in my life is to see as God sees and this is probably one of my greatest failures as a mortal as sometimes I don't see the way God sees I want to look at people in the same understanding with the same insight with the same pool with the same mercy I want to give mercy to those whom he will extend mercy I want to be able to reach to those to whom he will reach through amen I want to say if he calls something darkness I want to say it's darkness if he offers mercy I want to extend mercy so God looks at him he said I don't want the angel with a bigger swell I want the angel or the biggest hand so he can bend him over I want the angel or the biggest knee so you can bend him over you mean way out but God said who among us got the softest hands what was it mercy love did who would ever sink the softest hand would be mercy sometimes a kind word can do more to drive away a demon than all the screamin and bottles of all and shouting and talking in tongues can ever do I want to pick out the angel standing here that's got the softest hands now listen what he tells the angel don't you scare him it shows in this nervous breakdown the least little thing tears him all to pieces just a little rustle in the weeds in the bushes could so Terry much so that angel had to approach him with such precaution and be so careful than what you scary walk over and stroke his brow right easy and I want the best cook among you what was it nurse walked in in the form of an angel with the softest hand and the best cook that heaven had merci whoa I want the best cook of monkey go out there and get all the vitamins that you can find and put in this cornmeal Martha white ain't never fix it and like this the world's turned him down but I am gonna treat him right all friends may we leave today this may be so simple that it sounds like kindergarten but may you leave this serve this service so full of vitamins that you go looking for the devil I'll tell you one thing I hope that the inspiration of God so anoints me and anoint you and we get cornmeal cakes that are sacks so full of vitamins that devil will leave you alone for at least an hour at the church Oh think of it the Spirit of God moving the parvis prophet and this status that he said he don't need a rebuke from God he does not need the board to come and chastise him he needs a soft hand and the best cook I'm gonna treat him right hallelujah that means praise our God don't get scared of that bring forth the best cook we got cook him a corn cake send him down some water and this soft-handed angel went over and stroked a little servant of God on the brow remember if you've done your best God still got those angels in order maybe some of you here today need that same angel he's still employed by the Almighty praise be to God maybe some of you need a whoopin well don't worry the same God is going to help me to be able to stroke a hand may have a sword in the other hand it's a preacher it's amazing how a preacher can come gifted for that entire service he's got hand grenades he's got a bombs he's got H bombs he's also got power pack corn cakes and soft angel Saints when he needs them only God can custom-fit us sermon for all of our needs that are here today but I believe he can and will do such do you agree with me hallelujah hallelujah remember if you've done your best God still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he loved he loves you do you believe this do you believe God loves you as much as he did Elijah the Prophet he stroked his brow and the launcher woke up nice he's nervous maybe shaking and twitching and so he just comes over to you I'm nothing to do it Jezebel God sent me your way it's all right it's all right hold on okay calm down she also wanted me to tell you yeah set up your new setup you need to eat I'm not hungry my family saw our faces I know well we've got the best cook in all of heaven there's a little water vitamin water that's the kind you batch of grocery store and yours is okay well that is good take a little sip of water Oh what you save us in their deity of Jesus Christ 1949 hmm oh my goodness I believe that has helped me uh maybe I do feel a little bit better but still still not that's all right that's all right just eat all you can eat at one setting praise the Lord but friends I could unload on you cake after cake after cake after cake I never preach all I bring to church but I want to give you enough where your belly won't blow up but will you'll want to come back so if you don't get it all today come back Wednesday they'll be more hoecakes they'll be more next weekend lord willing but what do you want to do God understands we can only take so much sometimes so we just don't chastise him it he just each what he can take and it goes back into this depression I may hear him say something like this the Lord your God bless you you've done your best done his best and yet run from Jezebel done his best and is depressed done his breast best and is so nervous he can't even set up done his best that's one of the best signs you've done your best most of people who do the best never think they do the best because their best they think is never best enough they're always looking for better and that's why Satan will use it against him most of you felt like you're a great success in life and everything you've done I sure don't I've been living for God since I was a little bitty boy I'm looking more my regrets I wish I'd have done that I wish they'd have done that now look at I'm Here I am an old man most of my life has already done and gone what can I do now I can I go back and redo any of it I cannot and now my strength is gone as a young man my vitality is gone as a young man so what do I do am I going to wallow and say well I could have done that I wish I'd have done that I wish out a down there our journey on our journey arm at the end of every day I lay down on my bed Lord God I've done the best I could I'm immortal I fell short this day I made mistakes but lord I love you with all of my heart I pray all of my mistakes and my shortcomings are washed in the blood of the Lord Jesus father over all I'll feel like I have done my best of synthy science for a witness and the day of judgment they'll stand alone you done just what I told you to do I know you're tired and weary now and the Lord God created of heavens and earth has sent me to feed you this bread and this water you had to rub in his eyes and raise enough little frail shaking hands took ahold of the bread need it just then the great angelic choir came out and formed a little panoramic around him like that and began to sing the songs like no mother could COO her baby to sleep so he too sort of hoecake with all these vitamins and drink this little water and God sent the end gel it quiet come out and what did he do he needed sleep again folks who get depressed that's the way they do they don't have the energy to go do this and that and the other and they sleep a lot a lot of them and they just don't feel like they have nothing to live for and he comes God doesn't rebuke him because it doesn't instantly drive away he knows he needs several hoecakes and several doses of water amen sometimes you come in your you ain't ready for church one song don't lift you up out of where you are sometimes you need another sometimes you need another hey man but he's laughing he's merciful he's kind to us to give us what we need let him sleep again mother father turned around and said you know how I love him so much and the journey's great he's got to go so a lot yet I'm not gonna go through with him but I must feed him again so he called the angels and dumped in another big bundle of vitamins and cooked up another corn cake that's what I'm doing here this moon corn cakes with lamb chops boys I don't like lamb you will this one it's the Lamb of God praise be to God we're eating the lamb before our charity mercy I'm so glad that there's a juniper tree where we can all get war when we all get wore out and tore up we can go into that juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of trip there ahead woke up feeling a little bit better a little bit better a little bit better and he went 40 days and 40 nights I imagine

and fell down Elijah just set and listened and there came a shaking in an earthquake that shook the mountain but Elijah said still and then come the fire fell lightning flash Elijah sit still then a still small voice spoke and allowed to answer he wrapped his mantle over his face and walked out I just wonder if we haven't listened too much to the rushing mighty wind and the fire and the blood and everything else and it failed to hear that still small voice wonder if we will look so much to the gifts that we can't see the giver mercy walk down pal mercy becomes incarnate and this same man first King 17/8 and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to Zaire pass which belongeth to Sidon and dwell there and behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee the mystery about this is she didn't know it yet so he arose and went to Sara pass and when he came to the gate of the city behold a widowed woman was there gathering the cross for the six and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in the vessel that I may drink and if she was going to fetch it he called to her and say bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in Vanhanen she said as the Lord died God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little all in the crus and behold I am gathering two sticks but I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die but mercy is going to ask her for everything she has you see friends if we're not careful mercy will be right in our own life moving in ways that we don't comprehend and understand it because we've got our mindset we'll miss mercy mercy may ask you for some of you think I can't do it I can't give it if you'll give it mercy will give back to you who I just said unto

walked in mercy walked in her yard she walked in her house she walked out of her house to mercy and a miracle happened to her hold her all at her meal barrel she walked in with a revelation of mercy she walked out with abundance of food but she had to give to mercy first so I don't feel like praising him how many times have we come to the house of God and God moving on our hearts to love me praise I don't feel like it I don't feel like it Lord you give to me first no give mercy what it desires of you and then God will have a blessing back make me there of a little cake first and bring it

off from among his brethren from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day mercy so mercy can come in the form of a soft ended angel it can come in the form of an angelic chef it can come in the form of a rebuke it can come in the form of the little boy sometimes first samuel 1745 then said David to the Felicity and thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to them then the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou has to fight this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand mercy walked in the camp mercy walked in the calf in the form of a little ruddy a small little God that whenever he walked out before the giant the giant looked at him and him and all the foolish things begin to laugh and say are you kidding me you mean you bunch of cowards this is what you send out to me what must mercy to Israel was judgment to the Philistine what was mercy to the bride in the form of this message will be judgment to the Laodicean Church this table the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give the carcass of the host of the Philistines this tender the fowls of the air can you imagine a little bitty old gal standing there looking up at this Big John so I'll cut your head off not only that I'm gonna feed you and your whole stinking army the birds is gonna be faster while

to Israel verse 47 and all this assembly shall know that the Lord save us not with the sword and with the spear for the battle is the Lord's and He will give us you into our hands and it came to pass on the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to me David that David Haye stood the other way but the Philistine comes and David tiger cub a boy come on mercy sometimes we need a man that will stand up and lead us in the forefront so David put his hand in his bag and took a sense of stone and slang it smote the Philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead I imagine David still they said whoa I never saw a rock that fast in my life when you get super power behind it it's amazing what a gravel can do [Applause] Marcy walk can let me tell you one thing the same God who can throw a stone can remove stones remember a few weeks ago my brother Michael Bailey was suffering suffering suffering he couldn't be in church on Sunday morning we called his name at the end of the service and y'all were praying with me we remember he had his phone he was sick here in his stream of the service on the phone in the bathroom vomiting right there he heard his name called and streaming in the service he runs and grabs his phone pulls it up to his heart begins to rebuke the devil you know what happened mercy walked in will walk in this bondage of time one day and change our bodies in a moment Mercy will walk in in the form of a rapture so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone is smote the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hands of David therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine I love them days don't you when you're standing on your giants and took his sword there you go God ain't just gonna humiliate the devil God's gonna allow you to take gas and ride in the midst of death in your own body God would allow you to defy death from within your being you will take the sword from Satan and decapitate his final hold on you in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you will behead death you will be had sickness old-age anxiety he drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him you do understand the rock never killed him it's just a dilemma real good all of a sudden you see this little whippersnapper hanging around over the top everybody your sword in his hand and you know this is a bad day you know you've been better off if you hadn't got up out of bed that day you wish you hadn't made fun of that little guy one day he'll one day he'll realize we're not just a screaming blabbering bunch of people that's following some message of some messenger somewhere but we are the people of God to defy the people of God is to defy God himself Daniel chapter 3 verse 23 and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace the Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished he rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire and they answered and said unto the king true o king and he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God what was it mercy walk there I love spiritual fire-retardant let me taste some for him God allows you to go into a fire he can spray you with the retardant then no matter what the devil says there what the devil does what was it mercy come walking in and he took the burn out of them so much that they ran out walking praising God and God allowed mercy to be made manifest a pre incarnation exhibit of Christ himself Daniel chapter 6 verse 19 then the King arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions and when he came to the day and he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel the King spake and said unto Daniel or Daniel servant in God it's not God whom now service continually able to deliver thee from the Lions and said Daniel done to the king o king live forever my God has sent his angel what happened mercy walked here [Music] my God has sent his angel they couldn't even roar they just squeaked all night man you Tom has some good eating that purr i profit oh boy he'd be good eatin they couldn't even come him they couldn't even lick their lips the angels of God shut their mouths [Applause] John the Baptist John chapter 1 verse 6 I'm gonna try to hurry if again listen friends the Lord started open this to me I saw a whole new series for now plumb to Eternity I thought Lord Jesus will never get the end of this there was a man sent from God whose name was John mercy won't ear you understand what I'm saying John was not mercy but John coming to the earth was God's mercy listen what John said the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that light that's you 31 and those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken about the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying and the words prepared you the way of the Lord make his paths straight and the same John had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his horns and his meat was locusts and wild honey mercy come walking in looking like a wild man would you identify him is mercy for you to live 2,000 years ago you heard him a scream and repair repair repair ducking people in water baptizing them in water a while looking God let him go to a restaurant sit down and I got somebody even some manners about him close it out with a leathern girl and camels her and rougher no cop would you identify to that as mercy if you select you would [Applause] Luke 1:26 the six month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name of Joseph for the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou hast found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus Mercy Mercy Mercy o the coming of the Holy Ghost and that's Chapter two what was it mercy walked in the upper room in the form of licks of fire when I say walks into your into your experience into your dilemma into your war it doesn't always mean that it's a man or a woman boy or girl it can be in the form of supernatural in this case it was a pillar of fire dividing himself but mercy walked in Peter found out that he had failed and walking with the Lord Jesus he found out that he had been a miserable failure as did John and all the rest of them but mercy walked in was what a new verse mercy walked in not another not another theology not with another quote from the Lord Jesus one that they'd forgotten this quote would help him to be overcomers he walked in with a new verse may I say to you today for many of you mercy walked into you one day when you were sitting in a church somewhere maybe you'd been around for a long long time but all of a sudden the spoken word open your soul and the baptism of the Holy Ghost moved off of your spirit right down into your soul and you got birth setting right there hearing the word mercy walked in mercy woke it she walked into your soul your body will walk out change Acts chapter 3 verse 1 Peter and John went up together to the temple the--how her prayer being the night there and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who soui seeing Peter and John about to run to the temple asked an Almond Peter fasting his eyes upon him was John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something he was expecting to receive something that is going to be receiving something that he hadn't expected and what he had expected he wasn't gonna get hey man that's probably the way show me y'all here today say man I'm going to church to get this not noting God's giving you all kinds of things you didn't expect to get then Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give out there in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth what happened mercy walked in in the form of John and Peter mercy speaks to this lame man and tells the lame man to do what rise up and mercy walked in he walked Lord God mercy walked in but what if he had managed it I'll tell one thing if you came give me this and not in the other I don't want what else you got he had an open heart he might have been disappointed financially but he wasn't disappointed leg wise why mercy walked in he took him by the right hand and lifted him up immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he's setting down went to sleep and realize he leaping leaping stood up have you ever tried that leaping standing up now you're flat on the ground he don't just he leaps up from a sitting position mercy walked in he leaped out couple more clothes a good sister in the Apostolic Church passed away acts 936 there was that job a certain disciple named Tabitha which was my interpretation called Dorcas this woman was full of good works and alms deeds which she did came to pass in those days she was sick and died and when they had washed later in an upper chamber for as much as litter was not to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent it to him to me and desiring him that he would not delay to come to him Peter rose and wetlands him when he was calm they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by and weeping it showing the coats and the garments which Dorcas had made or she was with them but Peter put them all force and kneeled down and prayed and turned him notice not to Dorcas but to the body in it amazing Luke does not call the body Dorcas the body is only Dorcas when Dorcas is in it whoa here goes another series OMA but when Dorcas leaves the body that's what it is the body so he turns to the body and said so speaking to the body now the body is not a bizarre wherever Tabitha is just fixing a cross home in the sixth dimension maybe already there just got right across the river and she's running to him through the tall blue grass as she's walking down through gathering with her people but all of a sudden mercy called her name from across the river tabatha arise and say opened her eyes and when she saw not Jesus she said and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the Saints and widows presented her alive she walked in in the form of Peter Peter and toss up Acts chapter 10 verse 1 a certain man and since the real call corniest accentuated the band called the Italian band a devout man one that feared God with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God always so in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him and sing unto him Cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said to him by prayers and that arms are come up for a memorial before God the Gentile Roman soldier in the meantime God's name was Simon Peter over in another city chapter 10 verse 21 then Peter went down to the men which were sent to him from corn ears and said behold I am him whom you seek what is the cause where of your calm and they said Cornelius the Centurion a just man one that fears God and a good rapport among all the nations of the Jews was warned from God by Holy Angel to sin for the end of this house ended amazing an angel of God told him to go get Peter why didn't the angel preach to him God don't break his word new bursts come through the body then call he them and love salmon on the morrow Peter wanna wave us and then certain brethren from Joppa company him and the morrow after they entered into seseri and Cornelius waited for them and call together his kinsmen and their friends and his Peter was coming in Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worship him but this is a true man of God but Peter took him up saying stand up I myself also am a man mercy walked in and it was so overwhelming this man bowels as he feels mercy verse 44 while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished they couldn't believe you dogs got the Holy Ghost the way they got it mercy walked in they walked out changed let me close Jesus preached the gospel the Apostles preached it wonderful things that happened the year is now in 96 ad many things have happened great transformations but there's still something that needs to happen after the cross hands way back to God he's been purchased but he still doesn't have the clear understanding verified to him of his inheritance so God on the outer premise comes down indeed him with his servant John John felt like he was put there to die but mercy walked here revelation 5:1 and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside see with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven no one else'll under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I where much o would be lost and yet now the cross has already come the Lord Jesus has already come his blood has already been shed John knows this but now God is tie the excelling of the revelation on over into the church ages that this is what may be a possible John I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon look mercy and one beholder saith unto me wait not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals and behold I beheld and lo in the midst of the Shonan the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slaved over to God where'd he come from John looked out right prior to that won't he come from mercy won't do you imagine John looking away for a moment may be white but his eyes Oh God we're all lost Oh God we can never come to inheritance and when he turns and he looked back there he was where any time from proceeded out the very heart of God himself not another being not another God not another man the same man mercy let's jump down but they're the malachi forward will close to this 2,000 years of church ages the darkness had clouded our perception the word had come to so so many cycles of revivals and wound up in the same time and such a mess God said in Malachi 4:5 behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming in the great dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to the father's lest I come and smite the earth with a curse if Elijah don't come the earth will be damned people can life they can really kill they can make fun or they want to the sending of Elijah was the mercy maybe you found a book somewhere a tape maybe somebody told you about it maybe others are sitting there with him and they tell us that you're crazy here nuts but to you merci longtail and maybe he's already saved but just a saved blonde man or a blonde save man didn't understand the Godhead you don't understand nothing else no you know why she's safe she's lost but mercy walked in and God told the seals away from your own life that's what as they did from the mystery of God mercy now bring it on them some you men was looking for a companion news there had to be a girl somewhere and one day you met a little dark-eyed dark-haired girl God in the form of that little lady mercy walked in your life maybe some of your sister's looking for a man looking for us but a mate you talked to this guy you talked to that when you talk to that one talk to that one but God oh mercy you said you believe it that way I do as a matter of fact I told that little brown haired lady there I snot when we went home sitting at the table I say one day God allowed mercy to walk in mouth in the form of you she cooks me many meals they're not as power packed as the angelic formula but they are wonderful she takes her kind gentle hand and rubs on my brow Donna you're telling the truth keep saying it don't be discouraged people's turning away don't be discouraged she tells me all the time she wants to stand there that day as I get my reward I want to stand there when she gets hers [Applause] as they journey down deeper and deeper and deeper into the cave it was darker and darker all of a sudden the man reaches over and turns off the light and the little girl standing not too far from him screams to the top of her voice it's so dark it's so dark but her little brother standing near the man who turned off the light said fear not little sister mercy just walked in there is a man here turn when the political regime will pull against us war council churches withstand and the whole world is pressing against us we don't know exactly what will lay before us but mercy will walk in it it may start just this new way and you're at the sink brushing your teeth in the morning you're fixing to go to work you're doing through your regular routine you're gonna stop at Dunkin and get your favorite coffee your favorite doughnut you know whatever it is this you've got your day plant you've got to meet the biz the office guy you've got to do this that the other but all of a sudden well you've got your head down brushing teeth spitting out the toothpaste a young man steps in your room and you realize it's your father but how is it he's younger than you are the resurrection is saying merci walked here it may be your husband that's been gone for 10 years or 40 or a daughter or son whatever more mercy will walk into your home while it's happening to you in Johnson City Elizabeth and is happening in Nigeria as the Saints there were awakened out of their sleep and they felt this strange presence in the room and they looked over on the wall and there stood a former pastor mercy walked in don't you want to be ready friends [Music] praise God Heavenly Father thank you Lord Jesus for your word and all last night and today have been very simple but I'll thank you for it Lord and its simplicity it has been so profound I think you dear God I'm sure each of us here today our needs would be so different some Lord they may need mercy in that angel with a soft hand others might need it in the form of correction maybe they need a spanking as which say others might need that upper room experience no doubt some here need mercy to step in in healing over to think of sister Chiyo Fleeman today fighting this terrible disease and her body brother toss and yet Lord also realized or God sometimes when our journey is finished hallelujah and Satan is allowed to achieve his life's goal against us and that is to bring us down to the point of death and our loved one is suffering and struggling to breathe and we finally come to a place to where we accept it it looks like they're going to cross over we believe mercy steps in that room and carries them across the river well it breaks our hearts and we cry we feel so sad that they're gone but in reality if we could have a glimpse just for a few moments of those who crossed over Lord I think in the last little bit how many that we've had to cross over nor the Warrens sister Stephanie others that no doubt will follow the Lord if we could call him back today they wouldn't come back to this world for nothing because mercy stepped in for the final time they boarded the train of deaths as we would call it of the ship of death but they had the ticket in their hand their destination was the sixth dimension so death couldn't keep them long it's only a moment of time really they step in and their eyes shut across the channel of death as soon as they get across there's a loved one a mama daddy a brother sister the Prophet whoever it is standing down at the river waving their hands screaming as it was to the top of their voices welcome welcome your journey is over mercy walked him oh god I really hope each of us today minister to us Lord according to your abundant mercy and kindness how many hasn't need today before the Lord but you just raise your hand to God there's no one looking around now you just hold that need in your heart praise God I've got so many folks that are sick this flu and all these things that are going around and we're going to pray for them but I want to pray for you too is your need whatever it is before the Lord Hemme believes today what you've heard the truth you think God loves you as much as he did Elijah maybe you're feeling depressed the way he was in that day and somehow if Satan can convince you that in your depression that means you're less of a Christian that is a lie that is a lie God loves you just as much when you're depressed as he does when you're on the mountain he loves you when you have issues he loves you when you're not doing so good he loves you and he wants to help you Father before we close you see Lord Jesus there's so many in our church that's sick Lord with this flu and the stomach thing and so many things are going this cold earth Lord the last week it's just been terrible for us father in this part of the country we didn't hear it because our ears aren't tuned to but as we went atlas at all Isis awful this is terrible we don't want even get out we heard humans say that but if we could heard the earth the earth was grieving to the Earth's was groaning and groaning she wasn't made to be under the temperatures that we've experienced she's waiting for us the earth is waiting to one day the sons and daughters of God who have walked into Mercy will walk out was mercy to her and when we walk out the dawn of the seventh morning will begin and mercy will be granted to the earth
