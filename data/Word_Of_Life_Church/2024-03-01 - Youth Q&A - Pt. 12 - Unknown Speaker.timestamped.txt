[17:43] Grace oh there he
[17:47] is
[17:49] greetings how is everybody
[17:51] tonight good day to serve the Lord in it
[17:55] such a privilege for us to be gathered
[17:57] together Let's uh read this question and
[18:00] then we'll read a couple of scriptures
[18:02] here it was one that I didn't get
[18:05] finished with um last time and it was so
[18:08] good that I hated to cut it short now
[18:12] I've already heard that from some of our
[18:14] young people that they said the only
[18:16] downside about brother Donnie answering
[18:18] questions is he preaches a sermon with
[18:21] every question and one of the reasons I
[18:23] do that is because I had a an excellent
[18:27] teacher his name was William Maran
[18:32] random so I never had course and an when
[18:35] I was a a youth whenever I gave my heart
[18:38] to the Lord as a matter of fact I never
[18:41] attended a youth service the first youth
[18:44] service I ever attended I
[18:47] preached so having Youth Services we
[18:50] never had it whenever I went we never
[18:51] had nothing for the use at all so you'll
[18:55] have to kind of forgive me if I don't
[18:56] know what I'm doing here cuz this is my
[18:58] first go around at this you know
[19:01] question for brother Donnie if you
[19:03] haven't gone through a great trial does
[19:06] that mean you don't have the Holy Ghost
[19:08] Philippians chapter 3 verse
[19:12] 8 yeah doubtless I count all things but
[19:16] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[19:21] of Christ Jesus my
[19:23] Lord whom I have
[19:25] suffered the loss of all
[19:30] things the loss of all things and do
[19:35] count them but
[19:37] Dum that I may win
[19:39] Christ well all of us probably have to
[19:43] say that same thing that he said more
[19:45] than likely not he goes on in verse n
[19:48] and say we may be found in him not
[19:51] having my own righteousness which is of
[19:53] the law but that which is through the
[19:56] Faith of Christ that the the
[19:58] righteousness which is of god by faith
[20:03] that I may know him and the power of his
[20:07] resurrection and the
[20:09] fellowship of his sufferings and this is
[20:13] what makes it so astounding to me that
[20:16] actually the things that the Lord lets
[20:18] us go through not things we bring on
[20:20] ourself but the things that the Lord
[20:23] allows us to go through he actually
[20:26] attributes it to his
[20:28] sufferings and that we are suffering
[20:31] with with him so we enter into his
[20:36] sufferings and the
[20:38] fellowship now most of us don't want
[20:40] this kind of Fellowship do we the human
[20:43] part but it's a great honor really and
[20:46] the fellowship of his sufferings being
[20:50] made
[20:51] conformable unto his death let's just
[20:54] pray over the word now father we love
[20:56] you so much tonight we thank you for
[20:58] once again giving us this privilege Lord
[21:00] Jesus that we could stand before your
[21:02] people I love them so much I thank you
[21:05] Lord they have a desire to come together
[21:08] again we were just here last night but
[21:10] they wanted together again tonight and
[21:13] I'm so thankful that have this burden
[21:15] and this desire and this pull to come to
[21:18] the house of God I pray that you'd help
[21:20] me to be able to get out of the way
[21:22] father and if there's a need here that
[21:25] lays outside of these question and
[21:27] answers make me sensitive to the holy
[21:30] ghost that I can be able to follow you
[21:33] bless us now as we sit together father
[21:35] in Jesus name amen God bless you you may
[21:38] be
[21:40] seated because a person has not went
[21:43] through a great trial does that mean
[21:45] that they don't have the Holy Ghost no
[21:47] it certainly does not as our journey of
[21:51] God With God rather is ordained of him
[21:54] our our experiences um our great
[21:57] experiences is in him so also are our
[22:00] trials that he sends us our way they
[22:03] also are ordained of God each one of us
[22:07] will go through the things that will be
[22:08] necessary and essential in order to
[22:11] complement what he has called us to be
[22:14] as we looked at it last week about Paul
[22:17] that none of the rest of the Apostles
[22:19] that we could read about in the book of
[22:21] Acts or and the rest of the Epistles in
[22:23] the New Testament or if I found and set
[22:25] in the N fathers the an father and hups
[22:29] to babblin many of the church uh records
[22:31] and things that I've been able to read
[22:33] about did any of them ever go through
[22:36] the same thing that Paul did but it
[22:38] didn't mean that they didn't suffer they
[22:40] did and all of us will suffer but that
[22:44] doesn't mean that we will suffer in our
[22:47] body it doesn't mean that you'll be a
[22:49] martyr for the Lord Jesus uh if we were
[22:52] living in the days of polycarp and the
[22:54] days of those type of people then we
[22:56] would have an anointing that would help
[22:58] us to be able to give our lives um as
[23:01] they did yet we know that we're called
[23:04] into a different age we're not called to
[23:06] an age of martyrdom and we know that
[23:07] martyrdom for the most part will not
[23:10] happen in this day there's still some no
[23:12] doubt I mean I've been to China and I
[23:14] know what they go through there and
[23:16] they're arrested as you know I was there
[23:18] when brother biscop was arrested many
[23:19] years ago and it was a very scary type
[23:22] of thing because they were looking for
[23:24] me and they were searching their
[23:27] database and looking for my entry and
[23:29] brother Bisal had my itinerary uh with
[23:33] him so we separated once we got there
[23:35] and I went One Direction he went another
[23:37] and he had my itinerary in his briefcase
[23:40] and when they arrested him he started
[23:42] tearing it up in pieces and started
[23:45] swallowing that so they wouldn't be able
[23:48] to locate where I was and find out the
[23:50] city that I was in he was a Canadian
[23:53] they thought I was a Canadian so they
[23:55] come in and ask him again Donnie Reagan
[23:58] is he Canadian and he had to tell him
[23:59] the truth no he's an American well for
[24:02] me um you know it was a frightening
[24:04] thing I'd never dealt with anything like
[24:06] that before so my brother Bisal when he
[24:09] was able to make a phone call he called
[24:10] his wife and said it would be a great
[24:13] time to be in Happy Valley so he was
[24:16] knowing that he was monitored by the
[24:17] Chinese police and the government so
[24:20] then sister Bisal called brother Tom Ray
[24:22] brother Tom Ray called me in China
[24:24] brother Donnie you need to leave us I'm
[24:25] not leaving I'm not leaving our brother
[24:28] here in jail I'm not a coward so brother
[24:30] Murphy was with me he said brother
[24:31] Donnie you don't understand it's not
[24:33] that you're a coward you can get out of
[24:35] here but for these people they live here
[24:39] they'll be the ones that'll be arrested
[24:41] and thrown in jail and they may never
[24:43] get out and I thought that puts it in a
[24:46] total different thing I couldn't keep
[24:48] from thinking you know if that were to
[24:50] be said about us in America you wonder
[24:53] how many people would come to our church
[24:55] if there was a risk that we could be be
[24:57] arrested we could be thrown in jail but
[25:00] will that be every one of our lot it
[25:02] will not but it does not mean that we
[25:04] will not suffer for him some of you will
[25:07] suffer uh because of the leot toan
[25:10] spirit you sisters no doubt you've
[25:12] already suffered an element of
[25:13] persecution by the way that you dress
[25:15] and the way that you look and there's a
[25:18] reproach that comes with that we know
[25:20] that and you will suffer in that way
[25:22] some of you Brothers you may suffer
[25:24] because you will be honest in your line
[25:26] of work and if if you would be dishonest
[25:28] you'd be able to maybe do a few other
[25:31] things and you know might do a little
[25:33] things underhanded under the table as we
[25:35] would say and yet you will suffer an
[25:37] element of reproach oh yeah he's a goody
[25:40] to shoes he will never do this you know
[25:42] he's Mr Golden Boy W think brother Joe
[25:45] he's this and that and the other well
[25:47] you're suffering for the cause of the
[25:49] Lord Jesus now compared to a martyr is
[25:52] that suffering well no we'd probably
[25:54] look at and think that's not much of
[25:56] anything but if that's what God
[25:58] allocated for you to go through the
[26:00] thing is that we want to do is be
[26:03] pleasing to him one of the worst things
[26:05] we can do is compare ourselves to other
[26:08] people I want you to notice that Paul
[26:10] again he picks this up in Colossians
[26:12] 1:23 if you continue in the faith
[26:15] grounded and settled and be not moved
[26:17] away from the hope of the Gospel which
[26:19] you have heard which was preached to
[26:21] every creature which is under Heaven
[26:23] whereof I Paul and made a minister who
[26:26] now rejoice
[26:28] in my sufferings for you so Paul was
[26:31] able to make a division here between the
[26:34] sufferings that was only for the cause
[26:36] of Christ and actually some of them were
[26:39] for the people of God every true God
[26:42] call in will do suffering for the saints
[26:45] of God a pastor will suffer in one way
[26:47] for the people an evangelist will suffer
[26:50] in a total different way I can't I I
[26:52] cannot wait until we're able to get
[26:54] there that day and we see God's Prophet
[26:56] as he walks up up there and God will
[26:59] reward him for all he went through for
[27:02] us to bring us this great message I
[27:04] thank God for it don't you every every
[27:07] Minister God call Minister will go
[27:09] through so much and it will be of course
[27:12] at at the alotment of God and they will
[27:15] suffer because of being called of God so
[27:17] were their wives so were their children
[27:19] so here Paul says now in my sufferings
[27:21] for you and fill up that which is behind
[27:26] of the afflictions of of Christ in my
[27:30] flesh for his body's sake which is the
[27:33] church now if a preacher gets caught
[27:36] being a liar he's not suffering for the
[27:39] cause of Christ if he gets caught
[27:41] running around with somebody else's wife
[27:43] guess what that's not for the cause of
[27:46] Christ if he gets caus caught because
[27:49] he's stealing money or something like
[27:51] that that's not for the cause of the
[27:52] Lord Jesus that's because the man's a
[27:55] deceiver and he's not living what he's
[27:57] preaching is that right but there's an
[27:59] element of suffering then that goes with
[28:02] the ministry this is why person should
[28:04] never preach unless they are genuinely
[28:07] called of God because this type of thing
[28:10] right here will drive you out of your
[28:12] minds this is why people cannot take it
[28:15] they think they want to be a preacher
[28:17] and then they enter into the suffering
[28:19] for the body's sake and they realize I
[28:21] cannot handle this so he says it for for
[28:26] in my flesh for his body's sake which is
[28:29] the church now James wrote about it in a
[28:32] little different way James chapter 5: 10
[28:35] and my brethren the prophets who have
[28:36] spoken in the name of the Lord for an
[28:39] example of suffer Affliction and of
[28:43] patience again in verse 11 behold we
[28:47] count them happy which endure you have
[28:49] heard of the patience of Job and have
[28:53] seen the end of the Lord that the Lord
[28:55] is very pitiful and of tender mercy and
[28:59] yet there's not a man like job in the
[29:02] entire Old Testament I mean Jesus
[29:04] himself come and said have you not heard
[29:07] or read of the patience of Job he never
[29:11] said that even about Abraham he never
[29:13] said that about Isaac Jacob Joseph any
[29:15] of the Patriarchs but job had this one
[29:17] trial Which history tells us last it
[29:20] about the span of a year so a year could
[29:23] be quite a lengthy time depending on
[29:25] what you're going through but you think
[29:27] of the years that he spent before that
[29:29] trial and the years that he spent after
[29:32] that trial and yet what comes to our
[29:34] mind whenever we think of the man job
[29:38] it's what all he went through and yet
[29:40] looking at it it was a very short Span
[29:43] in comparison to all the other lengths
[29:46] of days that God give him but has he
[29:49] been a blessing to you yeah he's been a
[29:51] b blessing to countless millions of
[29:54] people down Through the Ages but
[29:57] remember remember he didn't ask for that
[29:58] it was not him saying hey God you need
[30:00] somebody to go through a trial it wasn't
[30:02] job that wanted that but God knew he
[30:05] needed a man like job I'm glad I'm not a
[30:09] job I'll tell you one thing I'm so
[30:11] grateful that God had him because he's
[30:13] been such a blessing to us notice again
[30:15] in 1 Peter chap 2: 19 for this is
[30:18] thankworthy if a man for conscience
[30:20] toward God endure grief suffering
[30:26] wrongfully now see in a a situation like
[30:29] this this is not even speaking just
[30:31] necessarily about a preacher notice how
[30:33] Peter writes this for this is
[30:35] thankworthy if a man or a woman of
[30:37] course in in this case whichever it
[30:39] would be for conscience toward God so
[30:43] just for conscience sake toward God so
[30:46] you as a young person you're placed in a
[30:48] situation and your your conscience by
[30:51] the spirit of God taught by the word now
[30:53] I shouldn't do this this is not right
[30:55] for me to do this I I cannot do it maybe
[30:57] the school wants you to do this or your
[30:59] employer wants you to do that but yet
[31:01] the spirit of God within you says no
[31:04] this is not right and because you won't
[31:06] do it you know that your your boss might
[31:09] kind of frown on you a little bit and
[31:11] you're you're somebody you're going to
[31:13] school with oh come on you're just too
[31:15] oldfashioned but why are you doing that
[31:17] because there's something in you that
[31:19] your conscience is toward God and James
[31:21] says that if you'll suffer or Peter
[31:23] rather suffer wrongfully for what Glory
[31:27] is it when you be buffeted for your
[31:30] faults boy we've all got enough of them
[31:33] don't we but there's no glory when we're
[31:36] buffeted for our faults but he said You
[31:39] shall take it patiently but if when you
[31:42] do well and suffer for it so this is a
[31:46] category that absolutely every person
[31:49] that you're tonight and there's hundreds
[31:51] that'll be streaming the service and
[31:52] archive it later so those of you that
[31:54] are not in this visible audience
[31:56] whenever you you suffer for the cause of
[31:59] the Lord Jesus so don't get it in your
[32:01] mind that you've got to be you know
[32:03] you've got to be a a martyr you've got
[32:05] to be somebody that God will allow you
[32:07] to go through some horrible terrific
[32:10] trial and you'll be there for years and
[32:12] years well you I've never been through
[32:14] any of that you don't have to but what
[32:17] you will do is you will be faithful to
[32:19] whatever God and his wisdom allows you
[32:22] to go through and when you stand before
[32:24] him that day he will reward you for
[32:27] every one of those times that you would
[32:30] be honest and true and you would suffer
[32:33] for being a child of God how many knows
[32:36] what I'm talking about no doubt every
[32:37] one of you went through it already so he
[32:39] said when you do well and suffer for it
[32:42] if you take it patiently that is
[32:44] acceptable with God and 1 Peter 4:1 16
[32:48] notice this is strange because to us the
[32:51] term Christian is used very very often
[32:54] this one of the few times in the New
[32:56] Testament
[32:57] that you'll find it the only time
[32:59] actually that you'll find it being
[33:00] phrased as an identification of a term
[33:03] Christian because Christian was a term
[33:07] that was actually a term of ridicule and
[33:10] it was not actually the Believers that
[33:12] started using it first but it was the
[33:14] infidels and they started calling them
[33:17] Christians which was means Christos
[33:19] which was Christlike but here Peter
[33:22] adapts this term because by now in this
[33:25] stage in the first century that accepted
[33:27] it that they were being called
[33:29] Christians yet if any man suffer not as
[33:33] a preacher not as a prophet not as a
[33:36] pastor but as a Christian how many of
[33:41] you all have suffered as a Christian
[33:44] just as a Christian your hair your dress
[33:47] you won't do this you won't do that see
[33:50] you have already suffered as a Christian
[33:54] if any man suffer as a Christian let him
[33:57] not be ashamed and let me not to add to
[34:01] the word but let me say not just a man
[34:04] now but you Sisters You Suffer as a
[34:07] daughter of God and we all know we're
[34:09] conscious of it and we know that in the
[34:11] natural sense the sisters in the message
[34:14] will suffer more by their appearance
[34:17] than will the
[34:19] men because the hair most of the men I
[34:22] mean they don't have their hair hanging
[34:23] down their back you know you don't see
[34:25] any of our men going around in many
[34:26] skirt
[34:27] although Carolyn I saw a guy the other
[34:29] day and it was one of the most bizarre
[34:31] things I ever seen in my life the man
[34:32] had a beard and he had on a pair of
[34:34] glistening high heel shoes and had on a
[34:37] dress I mean it just about make you
[34:39] vomit and people just looking at him and
[34:42] looking at him it was just absolutely
[34:44] bizarre but and I thought you know there
[34:46] that man is actually suffering reproach
[34:51] for this image I'm not sure what he was
[34:53] trying to prove but had on uh you know
[34:55] these glistening silver high heel shoes
[34:58] and a dress and a beard of all things
[35:02] and a woman's hat now you talking about
[35:04] weird I don't know if the man didn't
[35:05] have time to shave before he went out
[35:07] looking like a woman I I don't know but
[35:10] you think that the the people laughing
[35:13] at him people looking at him turning
[35:15] around the corner and I thought he's
[35:17] bearing reproach for a sin that unless
[35:20] you get delivered from will take him to
[35:23] hell and you be reproach for what is
[35:27] right so don't be ashamed don't be
[35:31] ashamed let's look at the church age
[35:34] book now about this about
[35:37] suffering page 116 now the Lord God
[35:40] Almighty says I know there he is walking
[35:43] in the midst of his
[35:45] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[35:48] the flock but does he hold back the
[35:52] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[35:55] no he does not he simply says I know
[36:01] your
[36:01] tribulation I am not unmindful at all of
[36:04] your suffering what a stumbling block
[36:07] this is to so many people like Israel
[36:11] they wonder if God really loves them how
[36:15] can God be just and loving if he stands
[36:19] by and watches his people suffer now he
[36:24] reads this scripture here in Malachi
[36:26] this is why they ask in Malachi 1 1:3
[36:28] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[36:30] Israel about Malachi I have loved you
[36:32] sayith the Lord yet we say wherein hast
[36:35] thou loved us now God said I've Loved
[36:38] You Israel and Israel said what you're
[36:41] telling us you've loved us I have loved
[36:44] you sayith the Lord yet we say wherein
[36:46] has thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's
[36:48] brother sayith the Lord and yet I love
[36:50] Jacob and I hated Esau I laid his
[36:53] mountains and his Heritage waste for the
[36:55] dragons of the wilderness is you see
[36:57] they could not figure out God's love and
[37:02] I'm going to tell every one of you
[37:03] tonight including
[37:05] me I can't either we'll never figure out
[37:10] God's love it will not make sense at
[37:14] times God will be doing things out of
[37:17] love and the prophet mentions the term
[37:20] in the Third Exodus I believe it's June
[37:23] latter part of June 63 and he uses the
[37:26] ter term the tender hand of Jehovah the
[37:30] only place I've ever found it that he
[37:31] uses it quite that way and he's talking
[37:34] about the Jews been driven back into the
[37:36] Homeland and it was the tender hand of
[37:40] Jehovah and we can see that same tender
[37:43] hand in our lives but it sure don't seem
[37:46] very tender it didn't seem like to me it
[37:49] was very tender when my daddy would take
[37:52] his hand I never got a whole lot of
[37:54] weapons from my daddy but I can still
[37:56] still remember them so they were pretty
[37:59] outstanding and whenever he got done I
[38:02] ain't never beat me or none of that sort
[38:04] of thing but he would whoop me now Mama
[38:06] whooped me too as a matter of fact Mama
[38:08] whooped me about a month before I got
[38:10] married my mama stood about that tall
[38:13] and I knew in about a month I was going
[38:15] to get married so I had something I
[38:16] wanted to say to my mama and after I
[38:19] said it I wish I hadn't cuz my little
[38:21] mama grabbed me and got grabbed the
[38:23] switch and I mean she let me have it and
[38:26] I deserved it too because I was
[38:28] disrespectful to her and I should have
[38:30] never said it I would to God I could
[38:32] take it back and never say that to her
[38:35] so I didn't understand it but once I
[38:37] started H being a father and having
[38:39] children myself I realized how painful
[38:43] that parental love really was you hear
[38:46] the common term today tough love and we
[38:49] know what it means it means that
[38:51] sometimes that real love you have to be
[38:53] tough and you've got to say no I'm not
[38:56] supply buying you any more money to
[38:58] support your drinking habit or your you
[39:02] know your habit of addiction of this and
[39:03] that they use it all the time you know
[39:05] dealing with addictions and it is a
[39:07] tough love and God is the author of real
[39:10] genuine tough love and God knows
[39:12] sometimes he has to be tough on his kids
[39:15] I'm glad he is don't you but notice now
[39:17] what they thought love meant they
[39:20] thought that love meant no suffering
[39:23] you'd be surprised that the Christians
[39:26] that think the same
[39:28] thing they thought that love meant a
[39:31] baby was parental care but God said his
[39:36] love was elective love the proof of his
[39:40] love is election that no matter what
[39:42] happened his love was proven truly by
[39:45] the fact that we were chosen unto
[39:48] salvation because God had chosen to
[39:51] Salvation through sanctification of the
[39:52] spirit and belief of the truth which
[39:54] he's quoting the scripture there he may
[39:57] commit you to
[40:00] death you mean God out of
[40:03] love may commit our loved ones to death
[40:06] all of us have seen that have we
[40:09] not parents grandparents siblings
[40:12] children and God commit them to death
[40:16] and then people look at it there's
[40:18] people that have left our church that no
[40:21] longer serve God because God took their
[40:25] mother God took their father God took a
[40:28] child and and they just build this
[40:30] attitude against God I I I've never
[40:34] understood that myself I don't
[40:37] understand why he always does it but
[40:38] I've never understood getting an
[40:41] attitude against the only source that
[40:44] will help you ever understand it so you
[40:47] cut yourself off from the source and the
[40:50] resource of everything that you have
[40:51] need of but some people look at it that
[40:54] way God if you love me you would have
[40:56] let this happen they don't understand
[40:58] the love of God the love of God has
[41:00] nothing to do with the ups and the downs
[41:03] and the ends and the outs of life it has
[41:05] to do with God elected you before the
[41:09] foundation of the world and we have a
[41:11] promise that all things all things all
[41:14] things don't come from God but even the
[41:17] things that come from the devil he will
[41:19] M make those things work together for
[41:22] our good aren't you glad for that so his
[41:25] proof was a ction he may commit you to
[41:28] death as he did Paul he may commit you
[41:31] to
[41:33] suffering as he did job so God may
[41:37] choose
[41:38] people I think of my friend brother Ron
[41:41] Spencer and all that he's been
[41:44] through you didn't know
[41:46] it and I wasn't going to say anything
[41:49] about it till after he had made it
[41:50] public
[41:52] today but the doctors had told brother
[41:55] Ron that he had cancer in both eyes he
[42:00] went to the doctor on
[42:02] Tuesday and before the main visit they
[42:05] told him you're probably going to have
[42:07] to have a treatment in the one eye and
[42:11] possibly the other eyeball
[42:17] removed so this is the way they start
[42:20] out their day all day Tuesday was one
[42:23] scan after another and doctors and this
[42:24] and that and another reading of the
[42:27] scans so when they got to the eye
[42:29] specialist the oncologist of the eye he
[42:33] said there is no
[42:36] cancer in your
[42:38] eyes the doctors themself called it a
[42:43] miracle that's our God that's our
[42:52] God but then you look at it and you
[42:54] think they've done showed it in the scan
[42:57] that it was there and they had called
[42:59] him several times because they' really
[43:01] really concerned about the
[43:03] situation and you think the same God
[43:07] that could have touched that could not
[43:09] he went through the entire body and took
[43:12] every bit of it out at one time could he
[43:15] not have done that of course he could we
[43:17] know that he could so why didn't he he
[43:20] must have a reason that's beyond what we
[43:24] know and what we understand is that
[43:26] right how many times did we pray for
[43:29] Erica and we saw God move for her over
[43:32] and over again and the same God that
[43:34] moved for her could not he went inside
[43:37] of her body and took every bit of that
[43:39] out and annihilated that thing could he
[43:42] not have done it I'm sure he could have
[43:44] we've seen him do it before so he had a
[43:47] apparently he had a reason do I
[43:49] understand do you understand it brother
[43:50] Donnie I don't understand it a bit more
[43:52] than you do but I trust him and I
[43:55] believe him whether whether I ever
[43:57] understand it in this life or not I've
[44:00] already heard one testimony after
[44:02] another after another we got one from a
[44:05] sister in the church just a few days ago
[44:07] she was telling Carol she said I felt
[44:09] like I should share this with you and
[44:11] brother Donnie she said I've been going
[44:13] through this thing and this situation in
[44:15] her life and she said every time I get
[44:17] so low and so discouraged she said I
[44:20] think about sister Erica and I think
[44:23] about how she would press through it and
[44:25] she said that that's how I get so
[44:28] encouraged I've heard that from
[44:29] preachers in different part of the world
[44:32] that little girl is gone to meet her
[44:34] reward but her testimony is still living
[44:37] on this very night so you see what God's
[44:40] doing God allowed her to go through that
[44:43] thing and you know what God took her her
[44:46] reward she's gone there no more
[44:48] suffering no more
[44:50] sickness but ask her her
[44:54] daughters are they suffering uing they
[44:57] are ask me I'm still
[45:01] crying I'm still
[45:03] lamenting my heart is still
[45:06] broken Lance and I had to go to the
[45:08] cemetery
[45:10] yesterday for some things to finish up
[45:13] there that was all I could do to pull in
[45:16] there I'm still suffering she's not but
[45:21] his will to end her suffering brought
[45:24] her deeper suffering to me to her
[45:28] husband to her children to her mother
[45:32] and to many of you I know many of you
[45:33] are I can see it on your face tonight
[45:35] you're suffering you're suffering
[45:38] because the will of God to take her
[45:41] added a suffering that will never be
[45:43] lifted from our hearts totally we will
[45:46] never get over
[45:48] it ain't that right so you think it must
[45:52] be for a greater cause it must be for
[45:56] his will so how am I going to react like
[45:59] a Son of God ought to react because she
[46:03] got there by being faithful in her
[46:05] suffering I'm going to get there the
[46:07] same way I'm going to be faithful in
[46:09] mine I'm suffering different I suffered
[46:12] I suffered when she was here I suffered
[46:15] every time I had to take her to the
[46:16] doctor every time I had to take her with
[46:19] a chemo and I'd have to lead her in
[46:21] because she'd be so sick she could
[46:23] hardly walk I took her more than anybody
[46:25] did
[46:26] I saw those times I'd pray with her
[46:28] every time I would lay my hands on her
[46:30] and pray for her I'd be there when she
[46:32] couldn't hard even walk and get out of
[46:34] there I suffered for several
[46:36] years and now my suffering has changed
[46:41] I'm not suffering cause she's
[46:45] sick I'm suffering cause she's
[46:49] gone but am I going to get mad at God
[46:52] are you kidding me I need him now more
[46:56] than ever
[46:57] before and his proof of his love to me
[47:01] is in his
[47:03] election oh but Brother Don you're a
[47:05] preacher you understand these things no
[47:08] I'm telling you I don't understand I
[47:11] don't understand but I believe him
[47:15] anyway he may commit you to death as he
[47:18] did Paul he may commit you to suffering
[47:20] as it did job that is his prerogative he
[47:23] is Sovereign but it is all with a
[47:28] purpose let's skip on down there just a
[47:29] little bit there talking about the Lord
[47:32] Jesus in Hebrews 589 though he were a
[47:34] son yet he learned obedience by the
[47:37] things which he suffered maybe God needs
[47:41] to teach me
[47:43] something during this type of suffering
[47:47] I buried 144 people since I've been the
[47:51] pastor of this
[47:53] church 13 or 14 in 20
[47:57] 2023 I cried for every one of them a
[48:01] piece of my heart I've walked in front
[48:04] of caskets a portion of my life has been
[48:08] filled with death a huge portion of
[48:11] death over my life weeping and crying
[48:15] and seeing people suffer oh it's I I
[48:19] hate it I hate that
[48:22] part but God called me for that purpose
[48:27] he had to equip me to be able to deal
[48:29] with that I'm I'm a tenderhearted person
[48:31] by Nature so it it breaks my heart every
[48:34] sick person I see I'm out at Walmart and
[48:38] I see a little crippled up mama you know
[48:40] what I want to do I want to lay hands on
[48:44] her I was talking to a car salesman the
[48:46] other day he was telling me about his
[48:49] granddaughter went that day she was that
[48:52] very day getting her a treatment for can
[48:55] answer and I got ready I was talking to
[48:58] him for just a few minutes he reached
[49:00] over and shook my
[49:02] hand I said can I pray for you he said
[49:06] yes so he and I sit there in that
[49:08] business one of the business here in
[49:09] Johnson
[49:11] City the presence of God come in that
[49:13] little booth where we
[49:15] were as I offered prayer for that man
[49:19] for his granddaughter Mia her mother had
[49:22] donated her stem celles we prayed for
[49:24] her the Lord Jesus apparently didn't
[49:27] care that it wasn't in church because
[49:30] his presence come down in that little
[49:32] booth where we
[49:34] were you know why I could do that cuz I
[49:37] told him I said my daughter passed away
[49:40] some months ago said so I'm so sorry I'm
[49:43] so sorry I could have prayed for the man
[49:46] if ER had still been
[49:48] alive but I could pray for him and his
[49:51] granddaughter because you could see the
[49:53] pain that he was dealing with so my
[49:56] suffering brought the presence of
[50:00] God I plan on going back to talk to that
[50:03] man again and find out how Mia is today
[50:07] you see our lord Jesus could not
[50:10] suffer as being Spirit but as we looked
[50:13] at it last night he suffered so much and
[50:16] become a goat on that
[50:19] cross I've been studying it even more
[50:22] today and brother renam said that he
[50:24] died the
[50:26] death of a
[50:29] sinner so that we could sit here
[50:32] tonight and be
[50:35] saved he died alone in his
[50:39] death so if we have to die we won't be
[50:43] alone in ours look what suffering
[50:46] done to him it made him a high priest
[50:51] that can be touched by the feeling of
[50:53] our
[50:54] infirmities look what suffering will do
[50:56] to us it will make us more compatible to
[51:00] people around us and help us to feel and
[51:03] mean knows what I'm talking
[51:05] about in plain language the very
[51:09] character of Jesus was perfected by
[51:12] suffering according to Paul he's left
[51:15] his church a measure of suffering that
[51:18] they too by their faith in God while
[51:21] suffering for him would come to a place
[51:27] of
[51:28] perfection why did he want this James 1
[51:31] 2 to4 my brethren countered all joy when
[51:33] you fall un to diverse
[51:34] Temptation knowing this that the trying
[51:37] of your faith worketh patience but let
[51:41] patience have her perfect work that ye
[51:45] may be perfect and
[51:48] entire wanting nothing Romans 8:17 and
[51:52] if children then heirs Heirs of God
[51:55] joint HS with Christ if so
[51:58] be that we suffer with him that we may
[52:02] also be
[52:05] glorified
[52:07] together I hope that answers your
[52:10] question on that part let me close that
[52:11] with this quote here when you're sick
[52:13] and tired of this whole life and you
[52:16] love the appearing of the Lord Jesus
[52:18] better than you love your food at the
[52:21] table your wife or your children then
[52:25] there's a crown laid up for
[52:28] you not a crown a gold crown that they
[52:32] put upon your
[52:34] head but a
[52:38] body free from
[52:40] Pain crowned in the glory of God crowned
[52:44] in the
[52:46] immortality of Jesus Christ can't you
[52:49] see what awaits you young
[52:51] people this is what awaits you not that
[52:54] they're going to put a star crown on top
[52:56] of our head but we will have a body that
[52:59] will be a body liken to his own glorious
[53:03] body that's what's laid up for you that
[53:05] the Lord the righteous judge will give
[53:07] it at that day that's the day we look
[53:10] forward to all the suffering that you
[53:13] and I go through in this life it won't
[53:16] even be worthy to be compared to the
[53:19] glory that's
[53:21] revealed thank you
[53:24] Lord
[53:27] another
[53:28] question because the Lord is supreme and
[53:33] Sovereign and
[53:35] rules all why will
[53:38] Jesus need to be
[53:42] crowned if the Lord is supreme because
[53:45] the Lord is supreme and Sovereign and
[53:47] rules all why will Jesus need to be
[53:52] crowned that's a very good question I
[53:54] really enjoy enjoyed studying this one
[53:56] Psalms
[53:58] 110:1 David prophesying and he said a
[54:01] Psalm of David the Lord said unto my
[54:05] Lord the Lord capital L capital O
[54:09] capital r capital D said unto my capital
[54:14] L little o little r Little D the Lord
[54:18] said unto my
[54:19] Lord sit thou at my right hand until I
[54:23] make thine enemies
[54:25] thy foot stol now when Jesus came on the
[54:29] earth this is not just something that a
[54:32] person can read up or open up and read
[54:34] rather like a newspaper and be able to
[54:38] understand Paul says great is the
[54:40] mystery of godliness for God was
[54:43] manifested in the flesh justified in the
[54:48] spirit seen of angels preached unto the
[54:52] Gentiles received up into Glory God was
[54:56] so God preached unto the Gentiles so
[54:59] whenever the scribes the lawyers and the
[55:02] educated people come to Jesus to ask him
[55:05] questions Jesus would ask them questions
[55:08] many times and he would ask it in such a
[55:10] way that it
[55:12] intentionally would cause them to
[55:15] stumble because they were trying to
[55:17] approach it from here instead of here so
[55:22] Jesus now asked them this question and
[55:24] he refers to this
[55:27] Psalm what think ye of Christ so now the
[55:31] the scribes had asked him a question and
[55:34] Jesus says saying what think ye of
[55:38] Christ whose son is
[55:41] he they say unto him the son of
[55:46] David he saith unto them how does
[55:49] David in the spirit called him Lord
[55:55] saying the Lord said unto my Lord sit
[55:58] thou at my right hand till I make thine
[56:00] enemies thy foottoo if David then called
[56:04] him Lord how is he his
[56:09] son so lordship and sunship has to be
[56:14] looked at in the right way or you'll
[56:17] come out with two every time and it can
[56:20] be so confusing now Jesus said this on
[56:23] purpose and it absolutely just set these
[56:27] guys Minds in a WHL now notice what it
[56:31] done and no man was able to answer him a
[56:36] word neither does any man from that day
[56:41] forth ask him any more
[56:45] questions now it befuddled them they
[56:49] just didn't know what to say and it must
[56:51] have embarrassed them and they said I'll
[56:54] never do that again that was the end of
[56:58] question and
[57:01] answers so now why will
[57:05] Jesus have to be crowned when he's Lord
[57:08] of all now he is but as we looked at it
[57:13] last night now watch in
[57:15] Hebrews
[57:17] 2:9 but we see Jesus who was made a
[57:22] little lower than the angels
[57:26] for the suffering of deaths
[57:30] crowned with Glory and Honor that he by
[57:34] the grace of God should taste deaths for
[57:39] every man but now
[57:41] remember Jesus the man was what become
[57:46] the goat Jesus the man was what become
[57:50] the serpent on the
[57:52] pole the Father which Liv lived in him
[57:55] which was Spirit now keep in your mind
[57:58] that you are a trinity as well you have
[58:02] a soul a spirit and a body and when you
[58:06] see my body you have seen me in one way
[58:10] in another way I've never seen you and
[58:14] you have never seen me you have never
[58:17] seen my soul I've never seen it I've
[58:20] never seen yours you've never seen your
[58:22] spirit or my spirit but yet you kind of
[58:25] have an idea of what my spirit is and
[58:28] what my soul is by the way my body acts
[58:31] is that right so when you think about
[58:34] the godhead don't think about God being
[58:37] this old man in heaven and then God
[58:40] looked over and heaven and that was this
[58:41] younger man and God said son I need
[58:44] somebody to go down and die on the cross
[58:47] now would you do that for me would you
[58:49] be willing to do that for me and the
[58:52] little boy said you know what Daddy I
[58:54] believe I would will that's not the way
[58:56] the Bible projects it at all in the
[58:59] beginning was the word and the Word was
[59:02] with God now God Paul says it this way
[59:06] that God is that one who dwelt in the
[59:09] realm of immortality Jesus says in St
[59:12] John 4 God is
[59:15] a spirit God is a spirit not a man so
[59:21] God is a spirit but God wanted to become
[59:26] man and he did in Jesus Christ so what
[59:30] was that it was an extension of himself
[59:34] now notice my spirit my soul my body all
[59:38] three of those are me so what happens at
[59:42] deaths that Spirit goes back to God who
[59:44] gave it your spirit actually breaks up
[59:46] the prophet tells us when you die and in
[59:49] the resurrection you will not have a
[59:51] human spirit anymore you will have a
[59:54] soul a theophany and a glorified body
[59:57] you were never intended to have a human
[59:59] spirit because he was intended to have
[1:00:01] the theophany but you bypass it the aony
[1:00:04] that you could be tested what is the
[1:00:06] human Spirit made of five inlets
[1:00:09] imagination conscience memory reason and
[1:00:12] affection that's what gets us in so much
[1:00:14] trouble but in the glorified body we'll
[1:00:18] have the seed which is the soul and
[1:00:20] we'll have the theophany and the
[1:00:22] glorified body all three again in to
[1:00:25] make the one unit so father son Holy
[1:00:28] Ghost very same God all along but
[1:00:31] manifested himself in those three
[1:00:33] attributes so the body of Jesus Christ
[1:00:38] has never yet been crowned now remember
[1:00:41] he is a high priest whenever appeared
[1:00:46] remember the prophet uses the example
[1:00:48] whenever he appeared to one of the
[1:00:50] church A's Messengers and St Martin was
[1:00:52] his name and this angel appears and he
[1:00:55] looks like Jesus and he appears to him
[1:00:58] and said Martin don't you know me
[1:01:01] worship me and he St Martin kept looking
[1:01:04] at him had on a a brilliant looking robe
[1:01:06] and all that sort of thing but he had a
[1:01:08] crown on his head so he said Martin
[1:01:11] don't you know me don't you know me
[1:01:14] worship me and Martin looked at him and
[1:01:16] said get behind me Satan you have got a
[1:01:20] crown on your head Jesus has not yet
[1:01:23] been crowned
[1:01:25] his Saints will crown him there was
[1:01:29] never a king in the Old Testament or a
[1:01:32] priest which was able to carry both
[1:01:37] offices merged together in one now there
[1:01:39] was one in the Old Testament by the name
[1:01:41] of Uzziah and Uzziah tried to enter into
[1:01:45] a position of being a priest and God
[1:01:48] smot him with Leprosy because that was
[1:01:51] saved for himself to be
[1:01:55] King prophet and priest Trinity of
[1:01:58] offices manifested in that one body so
[1:02:02] the body of the Lord Jesus was brought
[1:02:05] to the Earth in order that God might
[1:02:08] have a permanent human Temple let's read
[1:02:12] it again there in verse 10 of chapter 2
[1:02:14] of Hebrews for it became him for of whom
[1:02:17] are all things and by whom are all
[1:02:20] things that in bringing many sons unto
[1:02:23] Glory to make the captain of their
[1:02:27] salvation perfect through sufferings
[1:02:30] again sufferings verse 11 for both he
[1:02:33] that sanctifies and they who are
[1:02:36] Sanctified are all of one for which
[1:02:39] cause he is not ashame to call them
[1:02:42] Brethren saying I will declare thy name
[1:02:45] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[1:02:47] church shall I sing praise unto thee and
[1:02:49] again I will put my trust in him and
[1:02:51] again behold I am the children which
[1:02:54] which God has given me now watch Paul as
[1:02:57] he's taking the priesthood of the Lord
[1:03:00] Jesus and showing that like Aaron Aaron
[1:03:04] the high priest was taken from among his
[1:03:08] Brethren God told the people of Israel
[1:03:11] in the Old Testament the book of Exodus
[1:03:13] I will make you a kingdom of priests now
[1:03:16] this was God's original will that God
[1:03:19] wanted all of Israel to be a priesthood
[1:03:22] but they sinned of course and then God
[1:03:25] accepted the tribe of Levi and Levi then
[1:03:28] would be the called out ones and they
[1:03:31] would be the ones that would Minister
[1:03:33] for the rest of the tribes and then
[1:03:36] there was an order of the priests there
[1:03:38] were The Men Who tore down the
[1:03:40] Tabernacle they could not actually offer
[1:03:42] sacrifices so there was several
[1:03:44] different orders the average everyday
[1:03:46] person could not carry the tent they
[1:03:48] could not carry the manora they could
[1:03:50] not carry the furniture but even all of
[1:03:53] those were a branch of the cheras sites
[1:03:56] and all of that that carried the Temple
[1:03:59] of the Lord and then Aaron was the high
[1:04:02] priest so he was called out separate
[1:04:05] from among the rest of his Brethren he
[1:04:08] typified our lord Jesus so our lord
[1:04:11] Jesus is the high priest but yet we are
[1:04:14] priests as well you believe that the
[1:04:16] Lord one in Sunday will be looking at
[1:04:18] that we are priests which makes us
[1:04:21] intercessors and we can also offer
[1:04:24] sacrifices to the Lord except not for
[1:04:27] the atonement of sin sacrifice of praise
[1:04:30] our bodies a Living Sacrifice and so on
[1:04:33] but the Lord Jesus become one of us that
[1:04:36] he might become our high priest now look
[1:04:39] at what Paul goes on to say for as much
[1:04:43] then as the children are partakers of
[1:04:45] Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise
[1:04:48] took part of the same that through death
[1:04:51] he might destroy him that have power of
[1:04:53] death which which is the devil so the
[1:04:56] Lord Jesus when he was raised from the
[1:04:58] dead he was given this glorified body
[1:05:02] but no no time in the Revelation or no
[1:05:07] time as far as the natural appearance
[1:05:10] when he raised from the dead and the
[1:05:12] disciples saw him did they ever note
[1:05:16] that there was a crown on his
[1:05:19] head now remember right now he's the
[1:05:21] high priest this is why it's important
[1:05:23] for you to understand
[1:05:24] the difference between high priest and
[1:05:27] kingship he is in the office of high
[1:05:30] priest and as long as there's one member
[1:05:32] on the earth of the elect that's not
[1:05:35] been yet fully redeemed he must be in
[1:05:37] that office of high priest but he cannot
[1:05:41] have on Bloody
[1:05:43] garments and be
[1:05:45] crowned it would be
[1:05:48] Unbecoming for his wife to see him with
[1:05:52] these bloody garments on
[1:05:55] so once he redeems that last one let me
[1:05:59] just say it to you like this that he
[1:06:02] will step in behind the curtain as it
[1:06:04] were and change his garments and when he
[1:06:08] comes out even John sees him with a
[1:06:12] different apparel on from the book as we
[1:06:15] looked at it last night of Revelation
[1:06:17] chap 5 that's whenever he sees him
[1:06:19] coming riding on a white horse then he's
[1:06:23] G about the paps the chest area here
[1:06:27] with a different type of a of a an
[1:06:30] attire because the garments that he
[1:06:33] wears display the office that he's in so
[1:06:38] if I would have come in here
[1:06:39] tonight and I would have been dressed
[1:06:42] like a hippie okay I'd have come in with
[1:06:43] sandals y'all know I don't like sandals
[1:06:45] anyway but if I had on sandals and I had
[1:06:48] on you know baggy breaches and I looked
[1:06:50] like on a hippie and I'd have on a
[1:06:52] hippie looking shirt and you say I can't
[1:06:54] believe brother Donnie look like that W
[1:06:56] that's not like brother Donnie my
[1:06:58] goodness that's not fitting you know
[1:06:59] what you'll never see me nothing like
[1:07:01] that cuz I don't dress that way I ain't
[1:07:04] a hippie or a yippie or a nothing like
[1:07:06] else like that I am who I am but we all
[1:07:09] know that what we dress like has a
[1:07:12] reflection of the way we really are well
[1:07:14] it's the same way with the Lord Jesus so
[1:07:17] he is not yet been crowned his Humanity
[1:07:21] now in that he's received a glorified
[1:07:24] body part of the shakina of he's he's
[1:07:27] going to come into has already been
[1:07:29] there I hope you understand any of our
[1:07:31] loved ones that have gone on and entered
[1:07:33] into the sixth Dimension my daughter
[1:07:35] Erica has already been crowned in the
[1:07:38] sense that she has received that
[1:07:41] glorified or that theophany body rather
[1:07:44] but she will be fully crowned when she
[1:07:47] receives a glorified body in the
[1:07:50] resurrection notice how brother Ram
[1:07:52] deals with this in the future home when
[1:07:54] he went up out of the water now that's
[1:07:56] talking about the Lord Jesus being
[1:07:57] baptized he said I saw the heavens open
[1:08:00] the prophet saw it and he saw the
[1:08:02] heavens open here come descending Out of
[1:08:03] Heaven form of a dove a voice saying
[1:08:06] this
[1:08:07] is my part of the
[1:08:11] earth that I have
[1:08:14] redeemed you mean
[1:08:17] God wanted to be a part of the
[1:08:21] earth
[1:08:22] wow why in the world would he want that
[1:08:27] why wouldn't he just create himself one
[1:08:29] well he
[1:08:30] did whenever he went to peer to Abraham
[1:08:34] him and two angels the prophet said he
[1:08:36] just
[1:08:38] went took some dust up off the Earth
[1:08:41] and and he stepped into a body two
[1:08:45] angels stepped into a body and he him
[1:08:48] went walking down the road with a staff
[1:08:50] in his hand dress like a man look like a
[1:08:53] man
[1:08:54] talk like a man Abraham killed a calf or
[1:08:58] had a servant too Sarah went in and
[1:09:01] fixed him a sandwich brought him some
[1:09:03] meal milk out and he sat down and eat a
[1:09:06] sandwich almighty God in a body that
[1:09:09] he'd breathed life into but what
[1:09:11] happened to that body he stepped right
[1:09:14] out of that body after his visitation to
[1:09:18] Abraham and went right back to the dust
[1:09:20] of the earth that was not in intended to
[1:09:24] be his permanent dwelling he could
[1:09:27] appear in a bush he could appear in a
[1:09:29] fire why he's a spirit so he could get
[1:09:32] inside a bush he could get inside of
[1:09:35] whatever he wanted to because he did not
[1:09:38] yet have a permanent
[1:09:40] body but when Mary conceived by the
[1:09:43] spoken word God said this is my part of
[1:09:49] the earth it will be mine forever
[1:09:55] I'll live in it I'll look out of it I'll
[1:09:59] talk out of it I'll heal out of it I'll
[1:10:03] raise the dead out of
[1:10:05] it and one day I'll set it on the throne
[1:10:10] and I'll hang above
[1:10:12] it and I'll call it my
[1:10:16] son for it is me in another
[1:10:22] form I've just reading to Carol before I
[1:10:26] came this
[1:10:28] evening someone had sent me a
[1:10:31] video and they were it was talking about
[1:10:34] that when a woman conceives a
[1:10:38] child and she carries that
[1:10:41] child even after that child is birthed
[1:10:45] by that
[1:10:47] woman some of those child that that
[1:10:50] child's
[1:10:51] cells remain in that woman's
[1:10:55] body I thought I thought wow that that
[1:10:58] is absolutely amazing so I sent it to
[1:11:00] Carol she's looking at it and she said
[1:11:02] you think it's really the truth I said
[1:11:03] well there's one way to find out let's
[1:11:05] Dr Google and we'll just see so sure
[1:11:07] enough I found one after another
[1:11:10] scientific news and Ma and one after
[1:11:13] another after another and they have
[1:11:15] scientifically proven that when a woman
[1:11:19] carries a child and gives birth to that
[1:11:21] child decad after that child leaves her
[1:11:26] body they have found cells from that
[1:11:30] child in women's Brains liver lungs they
[1:11:36] actually found the Y
[1:11:39] chromosome listen this the Y chromosome
[1:11:42] which is the male
[1:11:44] chromosome in females bodies of course
[1:11:48] and it come by them giving birth to Sons
[1:11:54] and even though them Sons had been long
[1:11:56] gone from their mother's womb that woman
[1:11:59] was still carrying that male chromosome
[1:12:03] in her body I told Carol I said
[1:12:07] Glory I said If a woman can do that it
[1:12:10] shouldn't be hard for us to believe that
[1:12:13] we were a cell if you please or a gene
[1:12:17] that would come from the very mind of
[1:12:19] God and even though we're down here he
[1:12:22] still carries a part of Us in him
[1:12:25] tonight praise the Lord so God said this
[1:12:29] is my part of the
[1:12:31] earth and from this part of the earth I
[1:12:35] will redeem the rest of it so God in the
[1:12:38] Plan of Redemption had to have his own
[1:12:41] humanity and he would call it his
[1:12:46] son so there's things that I could say
[1:12:49] about my flesh that I can't say about my
[1:12:53] spirit
[1:12:55] My Flesh has five inlets see taste feel
[1:12:58] smelling here my spirit has five I just
[1:13:01] quoted them to you my soul has one so
[1:13:05] people try to make a trinity and they'll
[1:13:07] say well there's things that you can say
[1:13:09] about the son that you can't say about
[1:13:11] the father I totally agree with that but
[1:13:13] I can also say things about my soul that
[1:13:15] I can't say about my spirit that don't
[1:13:17] mean I'm three people that means all
[1:13:20] three of them make me one complete unit
[1:13:24] so God said this is my part of the
[1:13:28] earth oh my I will redeem the rest of it
[1:13:32] for he is my word made manifest the
[1:13:35] whole world I spoke into existence by my
[1:13:38] word Hebrews 11 and Satan has held it to
[1:13:41] this time but I've come to redeem it and
[1:13:44] so much of it has made his
[1:13:48] body and I'm coming to dwell in
[1:13:51] it and John said I I saw the holy city
[1:13:55] the New Jerusalem descending from God
[1:13:57] out of heaven now watch brother random
[1:13:59] goes straight from the Lord
[1:14:02] Jesus to the city coming down from
[1:14:04] heaven as a bride adorned for it husband
[1:14:07] where did it settle on just like it did
[1:14:10] on there so he brings this now the
[1:14:13] spirit of God came and settled down on
[1:14:16] the Lord Jesus in The River Jordan and
[1:14:19] he jumps way over here on the eth day to
[1:14:22] when John saw the holy city the New
[1:14:25] Jerusalem descending from God out of
[1:14:27] heaven and he said where did it settle
[1:14:29] on just like EXA that it did there upon
[1:14:33] the Earth Jesus was a part of that Earth
[1:14:37] that the Holy Ghost descended on do you
[1:14:41] all understand the difference between
[1:14:43] Jesus and
[1:14:46] Christ you understand the difference
[1:14:49] Jesus is the
[1:14:51] flesh use yourself
[1:14:54] as an example your
[1:14:57] flesh through a mixing together of your
[1:15:00] mother's chromosomes 23 from her and 23
[1:15:03] from your father your flesh started
[1:15:06] being formed from the coming together of
[1:15:10] those
[1:15:11] chromosomes but your spirit was not
[1:15:13] formed by them your soul was not formed
[1:15:17] by them so you took on their DNA is that
[1:15:20] right then you begin to Interchange the
[1:15:23] said to you the cells in your mother's
[1:15:25] body some of you young ladies sitting
[1:15:27] here tonight that are married now you've
[1:15:29] got your own family yet have sign should
[1:15:31] be able to do it they could still show
[1:15:33] some of your cells inside of your
[1:15:36] mother's body though you are a separate
[1:15:39] individual being and God still has every
[1:15:42] one of his seed a part of them inside of
[1:15:46] him this very
[1:15:47] night in his thinking part of his being
[1:15:52] and God said I want to be a human I want
[1:15:56] to be a
[1:15:58] human so I'll make myself a
[1:16:02] body that's
[1:16:04] Jesus so John saw the holy city the New
[1:16:07] Jerusalem descending like a comet or of
[1:16:11] Dove coming down out of heaven and
[1:16:13] settling on an entire redeemed Earth to
[1:16:16] do what to claim every attribute that he
[1:16:20] made the Earth for every man that was
[1:16:22] ready represented in eternity every
[1:16:24] woman is redeemed in she's been scoured
[1:16:28] and burned by fire watch him now go
[1:16:30] straight from the earth back to Jesus
[1:16:33] Jesus and his fiery Temptations in the
[1:16:35] wilderness for 40 days notice then his
[1:16:39] ministry think of it the Holy Ghost
[1:16:42] descending upon Earth Jesus and that
[1:16:46] Holy Blood now watch I hope I don't go
[1:16:49] too deep for you that Holy Blood that
[1:16:51] was created by God the blood the life
[1:16:54] the creation of God Jesus was the
[1:16:59] beginning of the creation of
[1:17:03] God and the creation of God will be
[1:17:07] crowned now when will it
[1:17:10] be at the
[1:17:13] resurrection at the resurrection you see
[1:17:15] he could not get his crown yet until the
[1:17:19] work of high priest is completed
[1:17:23] when the Rapture takes place there will
[1:17:27] be no more Gentiles saved on the earth
[1:17:30] that'll be it Mercy Seat is closed he
[1:17:34] will then turn and deal with the Jews
[1:17:38] 144,000 as a nation and they will come
[1:17:41] back to
[1:17:42] him then what will happen we in the
[1:17:47] resurrection will Crown our lord
[1:17:50] Jesus praise be to God you see it was
[1:17:54] like the Song of Solomon when you read
[1:17:56] it and you understand the way they did
[1:17:59] it that whenever they would spend an
[1:18:02] entire week seven days an entire week of
[1:18:07] celebrating the nuptials the
[1:18:09] marriage both the groom and the bride
[1:18:13] would be crowned in those seven days the
[1:18:16] people would eat they would drink it was
[1:18:19] just one festivity after another for a
[1:18:22] whole entire week and both the
[1:18:24] bridegroom and the bride wore a crown
[1:18:28] and Solomon says that his mother was the
[1:18:31] one who crowned him with many
[1:18:36] crowns so in the symbol in the marriage
[1:18:39] supper of the
[1:18:41] Lamb oh think of it the prophet said
[1:18:43] that great table was spread down through
[1:18:46] there for thousands of miles
[1:18:48] long the resurrection will take place
[1:18:51] first the day and Christ shall rise
[1:18:54] first and they'll go appearing to us but
[1:18:58] I'll tell you one thing I'm looking
[1:19:01] forward to that hour I'm going to have a
[1:19:03] lot of saints appear to me praise God
[1:19:08] glory to God and the prophet said once
[1:19:10] you start seeing them you know it won't
[1:19:13] be long that you're going to be changed
[1:19:16] and he said think of it missing people
[1:19:19] you come up together missing on the
[1:19:21] earth they can't find you no more but
[1:19:25] you're missing what what's happened
[1:19:27] you've moved into another dimension why
[1:19:31] he's changed
[1:19:33] garments and he says he knows how we are
[1:19:36] in streetport
[1:19:38] 1965 or 63 rather he knows how we are
[1:19:42] that we'll be looking around for one
[1:19:44] another did brother so and so make it
[1:19:45] the brother so and so make it sister so
[1:19:47] and so so he allows us to get together
[1:19:51] first so we all get together you imagine
[1:19:56] we turn totally
[1:19:59] invisible to the people that's living on
[1:20:01] the earth we will come up missing on the
[1:20:05] earth now do you understand that Erica
[1:20:09] brother Jim bab all of our loved ones
[1:20:11] that have gone on they're no more than
[1:20:14] 20
[1:20:15] feet from where we are right
[1:20:21] now they're not that far
[1:20:25] away but they simply stepped into
[1:20:28] another
[1:20:32] dimension and so that Dimension is just
[1:20:35] a little farther back than what you are
[1:20:37] setting right
[1:20:39] there
[1:20:43] Hallelujah and we will step into that
[1:20:46] Dimension we'll still be here for a bit
[1:20:49] and we will step into that Dimension
[1:20:52] missing on the earth and we all greet
[1:20:55] one another oh how you been oh it's so
[1:20:58] good to see you oh it's so good to see
[1:21:13] you and then he
[1:21:16] will call for us to come
[1:21:20] up and we'll all begin to
[1:21:23] transcend and go beyond this world
[1:21:26] following him as we move out of this
[1:21:29] real here in the first four that we know
[1:21:32] and then we would have moved into this
[1:21:34] other
[1:21:35] dimension our bodies would have been
[1:21:38] changed and we'll gather
[1:21:42] together I I know it may seem very
[1:21:44] strange to you but we will still be so
[1:21:48] human that when we sit down at that
[1:21:51] table
[1:21:56] tears will come from our
[1:22:01] eyes as we take our seats at that table
[1:22:05] brother B said we'll reach across the
[1:22:07] table and Shake one another's hands them
[1:22:10] battle scarred
[1:22:13] veterans he'll let us all be seated and
[1:22:15] the angels will be the ones that'll be
[1:22:18] seatless and we'll all sat down there
[1:22:21] imagine there'll be a great hush
[1:22:27] that'll take
[1:22:29] place and here he
[1:22:32] comes and he steps
[1:22:35] out and we go to look at
[1:22:39] him and he comes up near you and near
[1:22:42] you and you all of
[1:22:45] you and you feel his
[1:22:49] hand as it goes to PCH touching your
[1:22:52] shoulder
[1:22:54] and you raise up and look at
[1:22:57] him the tears running down out of your
[1:23:01] eyes may be the last time you'll ever
[1:23:05] cry
[1:23:07] again and he reaches down and gets his
[1:23:10] robe and he says don't
[1:23:15] cry don't cry no
[1:23:18] more it's all
[1:23:21] over
[1:23:23] I love you
[1:23:26] child you're mine I'm
[1:23:30] yours it's all over your
[1:23:33] suffering your tests your
[1:23:37] trials oh I don't know exactly what the
[1:23:40] order of it will be well somehow there
[1:23:42] will be
[1:23:45] a this great place where we would be
[1:23:48] walking up
[1:23:49] to and he will be there
[1:23:54] it will not be the Judgment seat but
[1:23:57] more the reward
[1:23:59] seat and then we will be rewarded each
[1:24:02] of
[1:24:04] us and we will take our crowns as it
[1:24:07] were cast him as his
[1:24:12] feet so it was the
[1:24:17] shulamite Solomon's
[1:24:20] mother Bas Sheba
[1:24:23] made his
[1:24:25] crown but it was the
[1:24:28] shulamite who said it upon his
[1:24:33] head
[1:24:35] shulamite is the feminist form of
[1:24:42] Solomon who better to give the Lord
[1:24:45] Jesus his
[1:24:47] crown than his
[1:24:50] wife now remember Peter has been in the
[1:24:53] sixth dimension for over 2,000 years he
[1:24:56] still has not seen the Lord Jesus
[1:24:59] yet neither has Paul neither has any of
[1:25:02] the Saints in any of the church
[1:25:05] ages it would be Unbecoming for them to
[1:25:08] see him in his Priestly
[1:25:12] office they are all waiting can't you
[1:25:15] understand why all the
[1:25:17] ages are waiting on
[1:25:20] us every age is waiting on us if we do
[1:25:25] not come to completion and maturity
[1:25:29] there will never
[1:25:31] be a
[1:25:33] resurrection Jesus will never be
[1:25:36] crowned but I'm not worried about that
[1:25:39] not happening or you it will
[1:25:42] happen because we will come to
[1:25:46] maturity the crowning of the king of
[1:25:50] kings is waiting on us
[1:25:55] it praise the
[1:25:58] Lord let me let me find a place to stop
[1:26:02] the city was a throne in the top
[1:26:04] Revelation 21:23 and they had no need
[1:26:06] for the light for the lamb the Lord God
[1:26:10] is the light
[1:26:11] thereof the Lord God is that Pillar of
[1:26:15] Fire that followed the children of
[1:26:17] Israel through the winters and listen in
[1:26:19] the eighth day it's not like you're
[1:26:21] going to see an old man on one throne
[1:26:24] and a younger guy on another
[1:26:26] Throne what you will see as the father
[1:26:29] is this
[1:26:31] light this Pillar of Fire this
[1:26:35] Brilliance that's around the
[1:26:39] throne but there will be a human
[1:26:42] body sitting on the
[1:26:44] throne that is
[1:26:47] glorified that's the Lord
[1:26:51] Jesus
[1:26:53] he ascended up on the throne in that
[1:26:55] perfect Kingdom when the kingdom that
[1:26:58] Jesus is to surrender to the father that
[1:27:01] God may be all in all Jesus sets upon
[1:27:04] his throne here as our Joseph and the
[1:27:07] king is that light that will be on top
[1:27:12] of the Mount Zion and His Holy Light
[1:27:15] will
[1:27:17] flood the entire
[1:27:20] city now remember John said that the
[1:27:23] city will have no need of the
[1:27:25] Sun but it didn't say anything about the
[1:27:28] rest of the
[1:27:30] Earth the city is the only
[1:27:33] place that will have the privilege to
[1:27:37] live for eternity in the light of the
[1:27:40] king you know why cuz they were the ones
[1:27:43] that walked in the light on the
[1:27:47] earth if you walk in the light now you
[1:27:50] get to live in the light
[1:27:52] for
[1:27:54] eternity there was no need of the Sun
[1:27:57] for there is no night there do you ever
[1:28:01] notice John never mentioned nothing
[1:28:03] about there not being no night on the
[1:28:05] earth out there where the rest of the
[1:28:07] people lived but where you live there'll
[1:28:12] be no
[1:28:14] night we are so
[1:28:21] privileged
[1:28:26] on top of Mount Zion will set the lamb
[1:28:29] and the city will need no light for the
[1:28:32] lamb is the light thereof and above the
[1:28:34] lamb will be the father which is the
[1:28:37] logos God that great light Eternal Light
[1:28:42] that'll shine just above the throne and
[1:28:45] Jesus will not be on the father's throne
[1:28:47] but it'll be on his throne and the
[1:28:49] father will hover over the son which the
[1:28:54] father and son will be one and while
[1:28:56] they're yet speaking I'll answer and
[1:28:59] before they can think I'm thinking for
[1:29:02] them that's right and Jesus will commit
[1:29:05] a perfect perfect age to a perfect
[1:29:08] Living God that he has redeemed and give
[1:29:13] over to the father let me close with
[1:29:17] this God became material in a man called
[1:29:20] Jesus which was his son
[1:29:22] this son gave his life that he might
[1:29:25] bring other
[1:29:26] sons that God might become
[1:29:30] tangible working all in
[1:29:32] all in that day you'll know that I'm in
[1:29:35] the Father the father in me I and
[1:29:41] you what a
[1:29:43] day and we will
[1:29:46] Crown our
[1:29:50] husband the angels won't crown him
[1:29:54] they're not married to
[1:29:56] him but it will be you
[1:30:01] shulamite that will
[1:30:03] Crown your
[1:30:07] Solomon and you will be able to
[1:30:10] reverberate the words in
[1:30:13] eternity that he anointed Solomon to WR
[1:30:16] so many years ago I am my
[1:30:20] beloved and my Bel
[1:30:22] beloveds is
[1:30:24] mine I am my beloveds and my
[1:30:29] beloved is
[1:30:32] mine let's bow our is
[1:30:39] together oh Lord
[1:30:43] Jesus we sense your presence here Among
[1:30:46] Us
[1:30:50] father it's the the light of the word of
[1:30:53] the
[1:30:54] hour that helps us to see our
[1:30:57] journey it's the light of the word of
[1:31:00] the
[1:31:01] hour that shines on why we should dress
[1:31:04] different act different talk
[1:31:07] different the
[1:31:09] reason that the people of the church
[1:31:13] church anity and organizations and so on
[1:31:17] don't see it is it because the light
[1:31:20] they're living under doesn't show
[1:31:23] it but our light
[1:31:26] does our light tells us why we should
[1:31:29] live a certain way and behave a certain
[1:31:32] way so then when we move from this
[1:31:36] world we will be privileged to
[1:31:39] live in that city where the lamb is the
[1:31:45] light Lord God then we want you to be
[1:31:48] the light of our church

[1:34:47] a realm in the outer darkness when the
[1:34:50] prophet went went there as a boy 14
[1:34:53] years old he said that A Burning Flame
[1:34:57] would have been a
[1:34:59] pleasure compared to what he
[1:35:02] saw he was just falling falling falling
[1:35:07] in an endless eternity he said there was
[1:35:10] no mama there there was no Daddy there

[1:42:29] God I praise your living
[1:42:36] savior found a quote before I came to
[1:42:39] church I shared it with brother Donnie
[1:42:41] and brother
[1:42:42] rob you know you always wonder about the
[1:42:46] question and answers and you know I
[1:42:49] always like to look at what the prophet
[1:42:51] said about
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:55] it so he was getting ready to do
[1:42:57] question answers in
[1:43:00] 53 talking about people turning in
[1:43:04] questions he said we we want to find out
[1:43:07] the reason we do this is to find out
[1:43:10] what's on people's
[1:43:12] mind what they're thinking
[1:43:15] about that that's what makes a good
[1:43:18] strong
[1:43:19] Church
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:24] you know what I I was thinking is he
[1:43:27] was talking
[1:43:30] there when when you've turned in a you
[1:43:34] write it down you give it to me brother
[1:43:36] BR on a piece of paper your
[1:43:38] question or you send it a WhatsApp or a
[1:43:41] text and say can you ask brother Donnie
[1:43:43] this for
[1:43:45] me you're not just wanting to find
[1:43:48] out something intellect
[1:43:51] ual you're asking for more of
[1:43:54] him what does the word say the Bible
[1:43:58] says in the beginning was the word the
[1:44:00] word was with God and the Word was
[1:44:04] God so you're wanting to know more about
[1:44:07] God it's just not it's not just
[1:44:09] intellectual if we leave it up here
[1:44:12] somebody can explain it to you somebody
[1:44:13] can explain it away from
[1:44:16] you but when it gets here when it
[1:44:18] becomes
[1:44:19] revelation
[1:44:21] your questions you know I can imagine
[1:44:24] that one day you might not even know
[1:44:27] what prompts you to turn the question in
[1:44:28] but one day you might be on the other
[1:44:30] side and you see somebody fighting
[1:44:31] through a crowd pushing to get to you on
[1:44:34] that other
[1:44:36] side and they're going to tell you
[1:44:37] somebody from Australia or somebody from
[1:44:39] Norway might say well you were 14 years
[1:44:42] old at Word of Life Church you wrote a
[1:44:45] question and one Thursday night your
[1:44:48] pastor answered that question
[1:44:51] that's when I felt the
[1:44:53] pull because you wrote a question
[1:44:55] there's people all over the world
[1:44:57] listening to the questions that you're
[1:45:00] asking so I I hope we don't we don't
[1:45:03] take this lightly I hope that we
[1:45:05] understand when you write a question in
[1:45:08] Lord tell me more about
[1:45:09] yourself that I don't understand yet
[1:45:13] tell me more reveal yourself more to me
[1:45:15] I I don't want it to stay intellectual
[1:45:18] you might think something as simple as
[1:45:21] do I have the Holy Ghost there's no
[1:45:23] telling how many people when you get on
[1:45:25] the other side because you wrote that
[1:45:26] question down receive the Holy Ghost as
[1:45:30] simple as it is why because it's more of
[1:45:34] him it's his word you've inquired of his
[1:45:37] word so you've inquired of him and he
[1:45:40] imparted himself to you
[1:45:44] tonight that's why I like I like the
[1:45:46] little sermons I don't I don't like just
[1:45:49] a straight answer
[1:45:51] tell me how I do this take me through
[1:45:54] the
[1:45:55] word take me through
[1:45:59] God I love it I'm I'm so thankful for
[1:46:02] for you
[1:46:03] all the the questions that you've
[1:46:05] written have helped me it helped me so
[1:46:08] much few things that I I I thought I
[1:46:11] told brother Donnie I've realized how
[1:46:14] little I
[1:46:15] know when you see these questions that
[1:46:17] come out from teenagers and and young
[1:46:19] adults you you think
[1:46:21] Lord I was missing in that spot
[1:46:24] too so I'm I'm so thankful for that I'm
[1:46:27] thankful for you and I'm so thankful for
[1:46:29] brother Donnie there's nobody will ever
[1:46:31] say brother Donnie gives less to the
[1:46:33] youth than he does the on
[1:46:36] Sunday he gives gives everything he has
[1:46:39] and I'm so thankful that he cares enough
[1:46:41] about our youth group to give everything

[1:46:45] has and I pray that you continue to to
