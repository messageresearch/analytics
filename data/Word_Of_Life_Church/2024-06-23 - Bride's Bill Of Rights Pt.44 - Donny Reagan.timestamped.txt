[37:28] moments be able to look over into that
[37:31] Dimension that's not more than 20 ft
[37:35] away I'd say all of our troubles and our
[37:38] worries and our issues would seem so so
[37:42] small wouldn't
[37:44] they I'm glad in one way that I don't
[37:47] have access to look into that
[37:50] realm if I could break into that realm
[37:53] weekly and look at it I'd say I'd be
[37:56] pretty much
[37:58] useless I'd be useless to you useless to
[38:03] myself because I would be so
[38:06] homesick and make me so
[38:08] distraught that I wouldn't want to live
[38:10] in this world
[38:12] anymore I'm grateful that the Lord gives
[38:14] us enough to be able to keep pulling us
[38:17] and drawing us but yet not so much that
[38:21] we think I just can't live another day I
[38:24] Can't Live Another Day that word is that
[38:27] land and that place and that atmosphere
[38:30] is so awesome and so wonderful aren't
[38:34] you grateful he knows exactly what to
[38:36] give us I'm like you sure I'll be honest
[38:39] with you I wish a lot of times my way
[38:41] was a lot easier I wish my load in life
[38:44] have been so much
[38:45] easier but I'd probably been sorry or in
[38:50] dirt sh you all had an easier way You'
[38:54] probably be so stinking rotten I mean
[38:55] we're a bunch of rotten SPO L the sins
[39:00] anyway so he knows exactly how to give
[39:03] us just what we need don't he never let
[39:06] more come upon us and what we're able to
[39:08] bear though the way we look at it
[39:10] sometimes it's way more than we're able
[39:12] he said come on Donnie put on your big
[39:14] boy britches you can take more than what
[39:17] you want to let on like remember who
[39:19] we're trying to trick almighty God I
[39:22] can't take no more I can't take no more
[39:24] I can't take no more he said come
[39:26] on you don't know what you can
[39:29] take but I
[39:31] do
[39:33] amen oh isn't it an honor to be a child
[39:35] of God
[39:36] today well we're here today with great
[39:38] anticipation to say what the Lord's
[39:40] going to speak to us once again and U
[39:43] our meetings coming up this U This Week
[39:46] begin with Friday brother Matt Watkins
[39:48] and U Saturday brother Daryl will be
[39:51] speaking and U he and I had been talking
[39:54] and we've been praying and just waiting
[39:56] on a little bit of direction from the
[39:58] Lord as far as a a prayer line I know
[40:02] that there's there's always so many
[40:04] needs among God's people and I realize
[40:06] that a prayer line sometimes is almost
[40:09] expected an every special meeting and
[40:12] that's not necessary to bad unless it
[40:14] becomes a custom and it becomes a
[40:17] tradition and well if you don't have a
[40:19] prayer line my goodness how can you have
[40:20] a meeting so I wanted to make sure
[40:23] before we did it that it was you know
[40:25] the right thing to do so uh brother
[40:27] Daryl took a couple of days away and he
[40:29] text me just there before yesterday and
[40:32] said he'd been thinking about it praying
[40:33] about it felt like it'd be a good thing
[40:35] for us to do um so the Lord had been
[40:38] dealing with him about along the lines
[40:40] of healing so we'll plan on doing that
[40:42] on Saturday night and with that in view
[40:45] I think we will up the service on
[40:47] Saturday night to 6 o00 instead of 7 o'
[40:51] and that way maybe we won't all be
[40:53] nearly dead anyway on Sunday morning so
[40:56] Brother David Siler will be closing it
[40:57] out for us on Sunday morning and we
[40:59] always enjoy hearing our brother David
[41:01] and we're just looking for a precious
[41:04] time in the Lord I consider these times
[41:08] wonderful times to be able to gather
[41:11] together several of our Saints are today
[41:13] over at brother Josh Bennett and um I
[41:16] was privileged to be able to be there
[41:17] with them on Friday night and uh to see
[41:20] their new place that the lord gave him
[41:22] there it's just just so wonderful
[41:24] brother Josh is such a fine Brother
[41:27] and I so enjoyed being there want to
[41:29] thank those that was there from the
[41:30] church here pulling on me and helping me
[41:33] time I got done I felt like a wited dish
[41:35] rag got back to the room and I was
[41:38] soaking wet but I I really enjoyed being
[41:41] there I wondered why the Lord was having
[41:43] me go down a certain direction because I
[41:45] was preaching on uh whose report will
[41:48] you believe brother Josh told me after
[41:50] the service cuz what I was dealing with
[41:51] when I first started out was people
[41:53] leaving the message so I hammered on
[41:55] that for a little while and I thought
[41:57] what in the world am I
[41:59] doing so after the service he told me he
[42:01] said you didn't know it but there was
[42:03] some people here last night and tonight
[42:06] that have pulled away from the message
[42:09] and their Pastor has pulled away from
[42:10] the message and he said some of the very
[42:13] things questions that they had the lord
[42:16] gave them the
[42:18] answers I love him W you I just love him
[42:21] for being there
[42:27] now we can give him a hand clap cuz you
[42:29] know I couldn't do that I'm a noad from
[42:32] Kentucky so I certainly couldn't do
[42:33] anything like that but I said Thank you
[42:35] for telling me that because as a
[42:36] preacher sometimes you just wonder why
[42:38] am I saying this why am I going I don't
[42:42] understand Lord I don't understand but
[42:44] it just it encourages you whenever you
[42:46] you hear that let's read today from the
[42:49] book of Isaiah chapter
[42:52] 54 verse 4 and I want to speak to you
[42:55] again today on the r right to be married
[42:59] to God H the right to be married to
[43:04] God Isaiah
[43:07] 544 I hope and I get done
[43:10] today that you will realize what a great
[43:13] privilege that God has given
[43:16] you even to be saved will be an awesome
[43:20] thing and we know that there will be
[43:23] many many people that will be saved that
[43:25] will not be bride
[43:27] and we certainly are not here today to
[43:29] put down anyone but I'm just grateful
[43:32] myself for me that I have heard a higher
[43:35] call amen and it call me higher than
[43:38] just a
[43:39] Salvation fear not for Thou shalt not be
[43:43] ashamed neither be thou
[43:46] confounded for Thou shalt not be put to
[43:50] shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of
[43:53] thy Youth and shalt not remember the
[43:57] reproach of thy
[44:00] widowhood
[44:02] anymore for thy
[44:04] maker is thine
[44:07] husband the Lord of
[44:10] hosts it's amazing how many times in the
[44:13] Old Testament that this is used in the
[44:16] plural form hosts which means of course
[44:20] more than one so there's an Angelic a
[44:24] Celestial seraphim all different types
[44:27] of heavenly host and then there's a host
[44:31] in the Stars according to the Book of
[44:34] Genesis God when he made them out there
[44:36] and wrote his first Bible and he called
[44:39] them hosts so the stars are a host and
[44:43] then there's host here on the
[44:46] earth so the Lord of hosts plural is his
[44:51] name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of
[44:54] Israel the god of the whole Earth shall
[44:59] he be called for the Lord has called
[45:03] thee as a woman
[45:07] forsaken grieved in spirit and a wife of
[45:13] Youth when thou was
[45:16] refused sath thy God only God could take
[45:20] such a woman and turn her from a
[45:24] wasteland into a fertile virgin that
[45:28] would bring forth the
[45:30] Millennium I may let to be remembered
[45:33] today as we
[45:34] pray I'd like to say also whenever you
[45:37] turned in the entrance out here anybody
[45:40] notice that new graphics on that wasn't
[45:44] that beautiful out
[45:46] there brother Eddie and sister Susie
[45:49] gilworth printed that for us and they
[45:50] don't like acknowledgement but I'm going
[45:52] to do it anyway buddy so hold your
[45:55] peace man they was out here yesterday
[45:58] when I drove in from I passed out here
[46:00] in from North Carolina and it was
[46:02] blazing hot those of you that was out
[46:04] and they were out there sweating and a
[46:06] carrying on trying to put that on I just
[46:08] wanted to say thank you today thank
[46:19] you they have done so much in our new
[46:22] place signage one thing after another
[46:25] after another they don't want no credit
[46:27] it and they don't I I know that but I
[46:29] just want to say how much we appreciate
[46:31] youall thank you so
[46:34] much heavenly father as Mortals we like
[46:38] to give a word every now and then just
[46:41] to let people know that we appreciate
[46:45] them and appreciate what they
[46:47] do I cannot imagine what it's going to
[46:49] be like that day when we all of us walk
[46:53] before you we know according to the
[46:56] Bible there's a great book of
[46:59] remembrance that's been written even our
[47:02] prayers are contained and vows and
[47:07] they're poured out when a great Victory
[47:11] happens when we stand before you that
[47:14] day and each of us walk up there and we
[47:18] have to give an
[47:19] account we're so grateful that we will
[47:21] not look into the eyes of an angry
[47:25] judge we were for forsaken we were
[47:29] lost we were pitiful
[47:32] really but today we're
[47:35] found and you and your loving character
[47:37] don't want any of us to walk in to
[47:41] Heaven's Gates
[47:43] empty-handed so you give us things to do
[47:45] in
[47:46] life you're the one who give us these
[47:49] tasks you're the one who gives us the
[47:52] strength to perform
[47:53] them and then when we stand before you
[47:57] you turn right around and reward us for
[48:01] what you helped us to
[48:03] do forgive us for complaining and
[48:06] grumbling of the things that you ask us
[48:09] to do father may we be of such willing
[48:13] heart we can be transformed by the
[48:16] commission that's been given to us you
[48:18] see our needs
[48:20] today many sick facing different things
[48:23] in their life father we ask that you
[48:25] would come help your
[48:27] children I stand here father of all
[48:30] these hundreds of people no doubt the
[48:32] most needy person in the building it
[48:36] comes my lot to try to speak words of
[48:40] Eternal value and eternal
[48:43] quality help me Lord shut my mouth to
[48:48] anything that would displease you make
[48:50] me sensitive that I can follow the
[48:52] leading of the Holy Ghost when we leave
[48:55] this place today we'll say did not our
[48:57] hearts burn within us as he talked to us
[49:01] along the way bless the word father
[49:04] speaker and hearer we pray in Jesus name
[49:09] and the church said amen amen God bless
[49:13] you you may be
[49:20] seated in the state of
[49:24] Tennessee you don't even have to be a
[49:26] preach
[49:27] preacher to marry
[49:30] anybody so when I came here from
[49:33] Kentucky in Kentucky where I'm
[49:34] originally from you had to be
[49:38] bonded you had to have a
[49:40] license you had to have somebody that
[49:43] would actually go to the courthouse and
[49:45] sign your bond not because you're a
[49:49] criminal but they just wanted to make
[49:51] sure who you
[49:53] were so that whenever you signed on that
[49:57] marriage license or marriage
[49:59] certificate that they could be sure that
[50:02] you were
[50:03] validated and they knew what you were
[50:05] doing that you were
[50:07] qualified when Carol and I got married
[50:10] and we were going to my uncle's church
[50:11] and almost 51 years ago whenever we got
[50:14] married and in a couple of weeks it will
[50:16] be my uncle couldn't marry us I would
[50:19] have much rather him marri us but he
[50:22] couldn't because he had no license he
[50:25] had no bond
[50:27] so he never married anybody in all the
[50:29] years of his
[50:32] ministry and we know that natural
[50:35] marriage is a reflection of spiritual
[50:38] marriage a lot of people feel like they
[50:41] can marry someone to God because they
[50:46] think they can choose God's wife so then
[50:49] they have the ability and say well
[50:51] that's a good person and this is a nice
[50:53] person and and this person does this and
[50:55] this person does that that and therefore
[50:58] they should be they should be the wife
[51:00] of God the bride they should be the ones
[51:03] but you see none of us are validated to
[51:07] be able to say this one is this one
[51:10] isn't that one is that one that one that
[51:11] one none of us have been bonded or
[51:16] licensed or chosen by God to be able to
[51:20] say who is and who isn't one of the
[51:23] greatest surprises of course when we get
[51:25] there we'll be able to look around and
[51:26] see people that we never thought would
[51:28] ever be
[51:29] there cuz we knew them in life and we
[51:32] say oh my goodness there's no way they
[51:34] will ever even make it and maybe they
[51:37] squandered a lot of the years of their
[51:38] life and the Lord finally got a hold of
[51:40] them and turned them around and sure
[51:42] enough they're there and then you'll
[51:44] realize yourself and you look at you and
[51:46] say oh my Lord I made it that probably
[51:50] be the biggest surprise most of us will
[51:51] have brother Jim you think really I made
[51:53] it by the grace of God I actually make
[51:54] it and it won't be because of it any of
[51:56] your works that you done it'll be by the
[51:58] grace of the Lord so then in God's
[52:02] marriage it's very similar although
[52:06] churches and organizations and systems
[52:08] and men and Bishops and all that sort of
[52:10] thing they want to pick who they think
[52:13] the church is so every church say take
[52:15] in the Tri Cities area every Church
[52:17] feels like they have something special
[52:20] to offer the community their
[52:23] parishioners the people who support that
[52:25] building and that at work they feel like
[52:28] they have something special a little bit
[52:30] different than the other Church down the
[52:33] road or the other Church down that
[52:34] direction or the other church across the
[52:36] corner they feel like you know by a
[52:38] different name so they got a different
[52:40] name out here and they say because that
[52:41] name then we baptize in water versus the
[52:45] methodists which only sprinkle so we've
[52:47] got special something to offer then the
[52:49] unitarians they feel like they have
[52:51] something different the Universalist
[52:53] they have something different Seventh
[52:55] Day Adventist they feel like they have
[52:57] something different because they meet on
[52:58] Saturday instead of on Sunday so every
[53:02] Church feels like that they have
[53:04] something different and by doing that
[53:06] they want to promote of course their
[53:08] church and growth of their church so
[53:11] they want the parishioners there to be
[53:13] able to be a witness on their job and
[53:15] whenever they're out doing things and
[53:17] hey bring people to our church so they
[53:19] have bumper stickers printed out and
[53:21] some of them have little pin you know
[53:24] that they put out on their little uh
[53:25] their their dresses or their vest or
[53:28] their coats or whatever more I attend
[53:30] certain certain church and they have
[53:31] little banners and things like that
[53:34] what's that for what's a form of
[53:36] advertisement a form of advertisement
[53:38] and then maybe someone will ask well
[53:40] well where do you go well I I go to so
[53:42] and so well how is it oh it's a
[53:44] wonderful Church our church is so
[53:46] wonderful well I'm kind of looking for a
[53:48] church oh you ought to come and visit us
[53:51] well tell me about your church well we
[53:52] have this great Pastor he is Young curly
[53:56] headed I mean come from this Cemetery I
[53:59] mean Seminary I mean and oh educated got
[54:03] a smile like that guy from Houston I
[54:06] mean I just a killer smile I I've been
[54:10] there for years he never lashes out at
[54:12] anyone I've never heard him even raise
[54:15] his voice he's so Gentile he's so
[54:18] mannerly sounds like to me you're
[54:20] describing a funeral
[54:22] director I mean you're not describing
[54:24] any preacher that I want to sat under
[54:26] I'd rather I'd rather sat under a man of
[54:28] God that knew how to handle a two-head
[54:30] sword cut me up one side and down the
[54:33] other but be able to get me to heaven
[54:36] then I would all the curly-headed smiley
[54:38] guys that's going to lead me straight to
[54:41] hell if they don't tell me the truth
[54:44] right but you see in that every church
[54:46] then feels like well we've got something
[54:48] to offer and we feel like that by
[54:51] entering our gates when you come to
[54:53] those doors there we are the very
[54:55] entrance
[54:57] into heaven
[54:58] itself because we have the
[55:01] truth and we have something different
[55:04] than this church and that one and that
[55:06] one and that one and in reality we feel
[55:10] the same way if not we just sell our
[55:14] building and go join up with another
[55:16] church right and I could
[55:20] retire wow wouldn't that be awesome and
[55:23] y'all could have a really nice Pastor a
[55:26] like able one but instead we're here and
[55:30] you're stuck with me for the time
[55:33] being but that's only half the story I'm
[55:36] stuck with you all
[55:38] too so then why do we look at it
[55:42] different then we we dress different
[55:44] sometimes we walk different our
[55:46] doctrines are different our terminology
[55:48] at our church is different we say things
[55:51] that's not common to hear so you could
[55:54] visit hundreds of churches in our are
[55:56] area here and you would hear things said
[55:59] that would be so different very unusual
[56:02] when people come I see them from time to
[56:04] time as theyve come we've had so many
[56:05] visitors since we've been here and I'll
[56:07] see the looks on their faces and I think
[56:09] my goodness poor things that Miss think
[56:10] we're absolute bunch of nuts just
[56:13] absolutely nuts because things that are
[56:16] said because I feel like as well as you
[56:19] that we have a different type of message
[56:22] to project do we not we look different
[56:26] we we act different we have different
[56:27] things that we rally around we don't
[56:30] gather together our money and and send
[56:32] it to a headquarters and then
[56:34] headquarters tells us what we can do and
[56:36] headquarters sends us our pastor you
[56:39] vote your pastor in and vote him out if
[56:41] you wish to you vote your deacons in
[56:43] your trustees in I don't appoint them
[56:45] but you do that right so in that we're
[56:48] different so it comes in the same way
[56:51] about saying who is going to be the wife
[56:54] of God so every church then would
[56:57] naturally feel like they are the one now
[56:59] we come back to the Seventh Day
[57:01] Adventist and they studied prophecy of
[57:02] course they love the Book of Daniel I
[57:04] used to have a friend of mine that was
[57:05] Seventh Adventist actually he was my
[57:07] boss when I worked in secular works so
[57:09] many him went around and around and
[57:11] around on a lot of different things and
[57:13] you know oh my he's telling me how
[57:15] religious his wife was and boy tell
[57:17] Donnie she just prays and reads her
[57:19] Bible and he had a little trailer that
[57:21] he wanted me to wire up for him so he
[57:23] hauled some go-karts and things like
[57:25] that he didn't know how to do it so I
[57:27] put some lights on it for him and wired
[57:29] the wires up put a trailer hitch in a
[57:31] ball and this that and the other for him
[57:33] so he said now you'll have to come up to
[57:34] my house to do that so he lived a few
[57:36] miles away from me I said all right I
[57:37] can do that so I went up there and he
[57:39] said I want you to meet my wife you
[57:41] talking about a saint I'm telling you
[57:43] what I said wow I I can't wait to meet
[57:45] her that's that's really nice now I said
[57:47] I'm I'm not much myself I love studying
[57:49] this stuff but he said now she is really
[57:52] a Christian I said okay all right I I
[57:54] look forward to meeting her so I up on
[57:56] at his house after work one evening and
[57:58] knock on the door and a woman comes to
[58:01] the door with a two-piece bikini on I
[58:03] like to
[58:05] fainted he come out behind her and said
[58:08] meet my sainted
[58:10] wife I me I about had to have Mouse to
[58:14] Mouse not with her
[58:17] either now what we call
[58:20] Saints would be so different from that
[58:24] but yet they feel like because as they
[58:26] go to church on Saturday and on and on
[58:28] and on they're the bride well Jehovah
[58:32] Witness of course feel like that they
[58:34] are they're the bride and this one
[58:39] another religion over here that one and
[58:41] that one so how is God going to
[58:45] determine which is his wife because what
[58:49] church wouldn't want to be married to
[58:52] God so once the Church of Israel of the
[58:57] Old Testament broke their vows before
[59:00] God over and over again generation after
[59:02] generation then finally God said I will
[59:06] put you
[59:07] away in
[59:09] divorce and he said where is the writing
[59:14] of your mother's
[59:17] divorcement through the prophet
[59:20] Hosea who in Shadow and tip married a
[59:25] Woman by the name of
[59:27] Goomer and he gets her out of
[59:31] harlotry takes her to
[59:34] himself changes her
[59:36] identity but then of course we know she
[59:39] went right back to that thing again sold
[59:42] back into
[59:43] slavery and the prophet hears about her
[59:47] being for sale
[59:50] again so he goes to the
[59:53] auction you imagine as she he sees him
[59:57] moving and Milling among the
[1:00:00] crowd and the beds are going high who
[1:00:04] will give me 200
[1:00:06] 200 250 250 300 selling a human
[1:00:13] being but here Hosea walks up and he's
[1:00:18] the highest
[1:00:20] bidder you imagine as he walks up to her
[1:00:23] and she looks him in the face
[1:00:27] and she's thinking what's he going to do
[1:00:29] to
[1:00:30] me how is he going to treat me what's
[1:00:34] going to
[1:00:35] happen but he reaches over takes a hold
[1:00:39] of her hand and
[1:00:41] says I've come to take you home
[1:00:50] amen that was
[1:00:54] me God did this an antitype over and
[1:00:57] over again to Israel and eventually God
[1:01:02] says no
[1:01:04] more I will not be married to you as a
[1:01:09] national bride ever
[1:01:13] again your position has been
[1:01:17] forfeited
[1:01:19] forever but I will
[1:01:22] get a
[1:01:24] mulation
[1:01:26] Multicultural
[1:01:29] multicolored
[1:01:31] multi-race people called the
[1:01:35] Gentiles they will be the woman you
[1:01:39] should have
[1:01:41] been but you never were
[1:01:44] Israel you were constantly
[1:01:47] sleeping around on me constantly
[1:01:51] committing adultery on me and I forgave
[1:01:54] you and sent one Prophet after
[1:01:58] another but I'm finished with
[1:02:03] you now remember God knew that whenever
[1:02:06] he took a gentile bride that there would
[1:02:08] be an element of those Gentiles that
[1:02:10] would start doing the exact same thing
[1:02:13] and it wasn't very long at all after he
[1:02:15] started dealing with the Gentile bride
[1:02:17] in the church
[1:02:18] ages sure enough it started
[1:02:23] again so he had his Angel message Meer
[1:02:26] to write down and say there's some
[1:02:29] whatat that I have against
[1:02:31] thee for thou Hast left thy First
[1:02:35] Love and the first message to the first
[1:02:38] church age in the Book of Revelation is
[1:02:41] God going through the same thing
[1:02:44] again I'll tell you friends he's so much
[1:02:46] more patient than we
[1:02:48] are how many thousands of years has he
[1:02:51] dealt with us rotten sorry human beings
[1:02:55] but he is bound and determined he's
[1:02:58] going to have somebody that's going to
[1:03:01] love him I don't know the way you feel
[1:03:03] about it this morning but this is the
[1:03:05] way I feel I'm going to be one of them
[1:03:08] if y'all don't want to go up to you
[1:03:10] there's people in the tri cities that
[1:03:11] don't want to go there's church members
[1:03:13] that don't want to treat him like a real
[1:03:15] husband that's up to them I'm going to
[1:03:18] for me and my house he is my king he is
[1:03:24] my husband so that I don't argue with
[1:03:27] him I don't debate with him I don't tell
[1:03:30] him I don't want you I don't want you
[1:03:32] telling me what to do I don't want you
[1:03:34] telling me what to wear what I can't
[1:03:36] wear how I can talk how I can dress if
[1:03:40] he tells me don't do it that's good
[1:03:42] enough for me he don't even have to tell
[1:03:45] me why all he's got to tell me is do
[1:03:48] this and don't do that and I will do my
[1:03:51] best to do it or he may have to knock me
[1:03:53] in the head a couple of times to get me
[1:03:55] to do it but the end result is I will do
[1:03:58] it because I love him so how is God
[1:04:02] going to especially in the end time when
[1:04:05] the multiplication of denominational
[1:04:08] systems will be so many now even when
[1:04:11] the prophet was here there was 900 now
[1:04:14] there 30 something hundred I think was
[1:04:16] the last time that I heard about it
[1:04:18] probably more than that now it's been a
[1:04:20] few months ago so there's probably close
[1:04:22] to 4,000 different denominational views
[1:04:25] so every one of them of course
[1:04:27] considered thems to be a unique entity
[1:04:30] by which they have this special
[1:04:31] impartation by God to be the doorway to
[1:04:34] heaven but God himself is not going by
[1:04:38] that but God chose the way by which he
[1:04:41] would determine who his bride actually
[1:04:44] was and how she would be called out that
[1:04:48] is through the entity of the son of man
[1:04:51] now remember the son of man was first
[1:04:54] spoke about by God himself in the Old
[1:04:57] Testament and that was Daniel Ezekiel
[1:05:01] God called Ezekiel the son of man more
[1:05:03] than into the rest of the prophets so
[1:05:05] when the Lord Jesus come on the earth he
[1:05:08] be to merge the title of son of man into
[1:05:12] his own life now he referred to himself
[1:05:14] of course as Son of God but that was in
[1:05:16] the minority but mainly he referred to
[1:05:19] himself as son of man now you can
[1:05:22] imagine then the Jews when they begin to
[1:05:24] hear this termin ology that he's calling
[1:05:27] himself that that it really made them
[1:05:30] upset because he's saying he's this
[1:05:34] special manifestation from God and even
[1:05:38] more so than Daniel more so than Ezekiel
[1:05:41] then Jesus begin to say certain things
[1:05:45] that would happen about the son of man
[1:05:47] then the son of man must suffer many
[1:05:50] things and be crucified and all that of
[1:05:53] the Gentiles well that was present tense
[1:05:56] but then he be to speak prophetically
[1:05:59] about the son of man and he would say
[1:06:01] something like this in Luke 17 even thus
[1:06:04] shall it be in the day when the son of
[1:06:07] man is revealed revealed so the cover
[1:06:11] will be took off of the son of man and
[1:06:15] it would not be a Corporal coming it
[1:06:18] would not be a Corporal visible
[1:06:21] something that everybody would look up
[1:06:23] in the heavens and say oh there's Jesus
[1:06:25] there's Jesus look at there there's
[1:06:27] Jesus no but it would be a revealing of
[1:06:31] the son of man so what would it be it
[1:06:34] would be Christ himself in a
[1:06:38] supernatural body that would come down
[1:06:41] and be able to appear and disappear now
[1:06:45] remember even in the 50s the prophet
[1:06:48] tells us that the son of man has already
[1:06:52] been making his appearance so he was
[1:06:56] already on the earth now as we looked at
[1:06:59] it last week then there would be times
[1:07:01] that he would come this way but in the
[1:07:04] last days it would be with a special
[1:07:06] anointing notice and proving his word
[1:07:09] again Jesus said as it was in the days
[1:07:11] of Sodom now watch close in the days of
[1:07:14] Sodom so will it be in the coming of the
[1:07:16] son of man when the son of man is being
[1:07:19] reveal notice what he going to be not no
[1:07:22] more as a church not no more but the
[1:07:25] bride is called in that day the son of
[1:07:28] man will be revealed what to join the
[1:07:32] church to the Head unite the marriage of
[1:07:37] the Lamb so God won't be using a bishop
[1:07:39] or an organization or a system or a pope
[1:07:43] or something like that but this must be
[1:07:46] a validation by God himself so God will
[1:07:50] give us a way that we can know who's
[1:07:54] working under the administration of the
[1:07:57] son of man now it won't be coming down
[1:07:59] and shaking the preacher's hand and
[1:08:01] joining a church book in case you're
[1:08:03] wondering today we don't have a church
[1:08:04] book but we do have an entrance into the
[1:08:07] body of Christ anybody can walk on them
[1:08:10] back doors back there but that don't
[1:08:12] mean you're under Christ there's only
[1:08:13] one way to get there that's 1
[1:08:15] Corinthians chapter 12 for by one Spirit
[1:08:18] we were all baptized into that one body
[1:08:22] then once in that body St John 15:7 if
[1:08:24] you abide me and my words Abid in you
[1:08:27] then ask what you will is that right so
[1:08:30] Jesus gives us the entry by which we're
[1:08:33] able to come in to the family of God now
[1:08:36] notice he goes on to say that the
[1:08:38] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:08:40] this when the son of man will come down
[1:08:44] and come in human flesh and unite the
[1:08:47] two together now remember God In His
[1:08:52] glory in the express image of who he is
[1:08:57] in his fullness has never been seen by a
[1:09:01] human
[1:09:02] being but God has been
[1:09:06] seen out of his glory now remember
[1:09:11] according to Exodus 24 the elders saw
[1:09:16] the god of Israel and saw the pavement
[1:09:20] that was under his feet Moses asked to
[1:09:23] see his way and he said I want to see
[1:09:27] your face he said no man can see my face
[1:09:31] but there is a place by me and I will
[1:09:34] set you in the Cliff of The Rock and I
[1:09:36] will pass by and when I pass by I will
[1:09:39] move my hand and you will be able to see
[1:09:42] me and what he saw was the back parts of
[1:09:44] a man you see the Effigy or the image of
[1:09:49] God had stepped out of the fullness of
[1:09:53] that Glory
[1:09:55] that's the only way he's ever been
[1:09:59] seen now you see the Rapture of what we
[1:10:02] are looking for is not going to the
[1:10:05] wedding or the marriage but actually the
[1:10:08] marriage supper of the Lamb let's jump
[1:10:11] down there if you wouldn't feasted the
[1:10:13] trumpets here he's talking about Sarah
[1:10:15] God changed her body and turned them
[1:10:17] back it's a mystery that's to be
[1:10:21] revealed now in this time by the son of
[1:10:25] man
[1:10:26] man not Son of God Son of Man see the
[1:10:34] evening
[1:10:36] message it's a mystery that's to be
[1:10:38] revealed by the son of man the evening
[1:10:43] message turn back and that was the last
[1:10:46] sign that they seen was what that
[1:10:51] discernment now remember I mentioned to
[1:10:53] you last Sunday that the discern mment
[1:10:55] that was displayed in this age was not
[1:10:59] one of the nine gifts in the book of
[1:11:03] Corinthians it was not a gift of the
[1:11:06] spirit it was discernment or the prophet
[1:11:11] link these two terms together
[1:11:14] prophetic discernment or
[1:11:18] prophetic so who is it it's the Lord
[1:11:21] Jesus
[1:11:22] himself now I don't know how to explain
[1:11:25] this to you but there are times that I
[1:11:28] have
[1:11:29] preached and probably every preacher
[1:11:32] maybe goes through this and experiences
[1:11:34] it but it it's like that you're you're
[1:11:37] preaching sometimes it'll be when I
[1:11:38] first start out sometimes it'll be in
[1:11:40] the middle of the sermon sometimes it
[1:11:42] might be at the end and the only way I
[1:11:44] know to explain it to you is like this
[1:11:47] it's like that you feel the spirit of
[1:11:48] God come on you and the anointing begins
[1:11:50] to anoint your gift and when it anoints
[1:11:52] your gift you're able to move aside you
[1:11:55] may be as sick as a dog you may feel
[1:11:57] absolutely terrible you may be so low
[1:11:59] and so down you don't even how to have
[1:12:01] enough courage to lift up your head but
[1:12:04] the anointing will start moving on your
[1:12:06] gift when you start talking and then
[1:12:08] you'll become more and more anointed
[1:12:10] until you reach a pinnacle of whenever
[1:12:13] from that point on you start going down
[1:12:15] but then somewhere in the time of that
[1:12:17] sermon may not be every sermon maybe
[1:12:19] ever one of out of every five or one out
[1:12:21] of every 10 but it's like there's
[1:12:23] something else that takes you and I was
[1:12:27] explaining it to Carol yesterday she had
[1:12:29] asked me about it I said well the best
[1:12:30] way I know to describe it it's like this
[1:12:31] it's like that someone steps into you
[1:12:37] and it's different than
[1:12:39] you and it's like that person is looking
[1:12:44] out of your
[1:12:45] body and they take your mouth and they
[1:12:48] go to saying things that you don't even
[1:12:51] know it's not in your notes you don't
[1:12:54] have scriptures you don't have quotes
[1:12:56] there that uh that you can read but it's
[1:12:59] like this person will take you over and
[1:13:02] start speaking out of you and it's just
[1:13:05] like it's pouring out of an
[1:13:07] inexhaustible Fountain it may last five
[1:13:10] minutes it may last 10 it may last 15
[1:13:14] probably the longest I've ever been
[1:13:15] under that would be maybe 20 minutes I'm
[1:13:18] not sure I could live if it was during
[1:13:19] the whole sermon I don't mind telling
[1:13:21] you and then whenever that person speaks
[1:13:25] what they want to say you can feel it as
[1:13:29] it starts pulling away and Carol Tomy
[1:13:32] say I've noticed that several times
[1:13:34] before and it's like they start pulling
[1:13:37] away and then the anointing is back on
[1:13:40] your gift again and then you will resume
[1:13:44] your thought or your direction and then
[1:13:47] go right ahead with the service now it's
[1:13:50] the same spirit of God the same
[1:13:53] anointing of course and now remember I
[1:13:55] don't have the ability when the presence
[1:13:58] of God comes on me to be able to discern
[1:14:01] that's one inner generation amen that's
[1:14:05] what the prophet said over and over
[1:14:07] again that's one inner generation that's
[1:14:10] prophetic as a matter of fact he says it
[1:14:13] in 1964 now he said your pastor won't do
[1:14:17] this because it's one to a
[1:14:21] generation but it must have been
[1:14:24] something very s simar whenever Christ
[1:14:27] would come down and take over this man
[1:14:31] and begin to show him people's names
[1:14:34] addresses their houses uh you know how
[1:14:37] many steps went up to their house all
[1:14:39] all that sort of thing you've heard it
[1:14:40] many many times and yet whenever that
[1:14:43] would back off of him he would say was
[1:14:46] that true right was was what he told you
[1:14:50] the truth I don't remember what was said
[1:14:53] he said I I'll have to go back back and
[1:14:55] listen to that on tape because I I don't
[1:14:58] remember what was said so you see that
[1:15:01] was not him doing that it was someone
[1:15:06] else that was using his human
[1:15:09] instrumentality how many understands
[1:15:11] what I'm saying now you see that's where
[1:15:14] that we look at the gift of a prophet
[1:15:16] and a prophet's office different than a
[1:15:19] pastor or an evangelist or a
[1:15:22] teacher all the rest of the Ministry
[1:15:25] none other aspects of the ministry will
[1:15:28] ever walk where God ordained that
[1:15:30] Prophet to be and the church
[1:15:32] said so that's what God was going to use
[1:15:36] in the last days and I said the last
[1:15:37] time they seen was what that discernment
[1:15:40] before the chains of the body come now
[1:15:44] what's God knew in order to reveal
[1:15:47] himself that he would have to on
[1:15:49] occasion leave that fullness of the
[1:15:53] glory that only only holy angels are
[1:15:56] have ever been able to walk into now
[1:16:00] Jesus was the one that said no man ha at
[1:16:03] any time ever seen God and yet the Bible
[1:16:05] gives us examples and illustrations
[1:16:08] where it directly says that they saw God
[1:16:11] Jacob named the name of the place where
[1:16:13] he saw the angel pineal because he said
[1:16:15] he had wrestled with God but it was not
[1:16:19] God in the fullness of that image it was
[1:16:23] God stepping out of that in order to
[1:16:26] make himself known do you understand the
[1:16:28] Holy Ghost how many has the Holy Ghost
[1:16:30] today do you understand what that is
[1:16:32] that's your portion of God that stepped
[1:16:36] out of that fullness to be able to live
[1:16:38] in your human body how many's made
[1:16:41] mistakes this week how many's made
[1:16:43] mistakes in the last 5 Seconds probably
[1:16:45] most of us you know so how in the world
[1:16:47] could that holy God ever live in this
[1:16:50] through a condescended form that stepped
[1:16:53] out of that fullness now the fullness of
[1:16:55] the godhead bodily is upon the Earth
[1:16:57] again in that attribute which has only
[1:17:00] been your certain times on the Earth but
[1:17:02] it's not in me the fullness of the
[1:17:04] godhead is not in any individual here
[1:17:06] today but it's in the entire body oh
[1:17:10] praise the Lord now watch in Exodus
[1:17:13] 13:21 and the Lord went before them by
[1:17:17] day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them
[1:17:21] the to lead them in the way and by night
[1:17:25] in a pillar of fire to give them light
[1:17:27] to go by day and by night now notice
[1:17:30] this is capital L capital O capital r
[1:17:34] capital D so the Lord would appear to
[1:17:37] them in a cloud and then he would change
[1:17:40] himself to a fire and then change
[1:17:42] himself but what was the cloud what was
[1:17:45] the fire it was simply a manifestation
[1:17:48] it's the divine presence of God coming
[1:17:51] into
[1:17:53] visibility for he himself is
[1:17:57] invisible Exodus
[1:17:59] 14:19 the angel of God which went before
[1:18:02] the camp of Israel notice not an angel
[1:18:06] of God the
[1:18:09] angel of God which went before the camp
[1:18:13] of Israel removed and went behind them
[1:18:16] and the pillar of the cloud went from
[1:18:19] before their face and stood behind them
[1:18:22] so you see it depends on which side of
[1:18:25] the pillar of cloud you're on it tells
[1:18:27] who you
[1:18:29] is so he was between them and Egypt
[1:18:33] Egypt wound up on the wrong side of the
[1:18:36] cloud am I'll tell you friends you don't
[1:18:39] want to wind up on the wrong side of the
[1:18:41] cloud if you're on the wrong side of the
[1:18:43] cloud it's judgment if you're on the
[1:18:45] right side of the cloud it's Mercy if
[1:18:47] you're on the wrong side of the pillar
[1:18:48] of fire it's condemnation if you're on
[1:18:51] the right side of the pillar of fire
[1:18:53] it's justification
[1:18:55] notice again in Exodus 14:20 and it came
[1:18:58] between the camp of the Egyptians and
[1:19:01] the camp of Israel and it was a cloud
[1:19:03] and darkness to them but it gave light
[1:19:07] by night to these how in the world could
[1:19:10] the same thing the very same
[1:19:14] manifestation would blind some people
[1:19:17] and produce great light to others it's
[1:19:20] happening
[1:19:22] again oh my so that one that could come
[1:19:25] not near the other all the night Exodus
[1:19:30] 32:34 therefore now go and lead the
[1:19:33] people under the place of which I have
[1:19:35] spoken unto thee behold mine Angel not
[1:19:40] one of my angels but mine Angel this is
[1:19:45] going to be God's own personal theophany
[1:19:49] yeah which is Christ shall go before
[1:19:53] thee nevertheless in the Day When I
[1:19:55] visit I will visit their sin upon them
[1:19:58] in Exodus 33:13 now therefore I pray
[1:20:01] thee if I have found Grace in thy sight
[1:20:04] Moses prayed show me now thy way that I
[1:20:07] may Know Thee that I may find Grace in
[1:20:09] thy sight and consider this this thy
[1:20:11] Nation thy people and he said my
[1:20:16] presence we read this the other day
[1:20:19] pum face in front
[1:20:23] of to
[1:20:25] front the face of at the face or the
[1:20:31] front from before or from before the
[1:20:35] face my
[1:20:38] presence my presence shall go with thee
[1:20:43] and I will give thee rest and he said
[1:20:45] unto him If thy
[1:20:47] presence shall not go with me carry us
[1:20:52] not up hence
[1:20:56] this is the term that I mentioned to you
[1:20:58] the other night that I had stumbled
[1:20:59] across in studying and it was a word
[1:21:02] that I'd never looked at in all my years
[1:21:04] of studying the scripture I'd never run
[1:21:07] ac across this compound name of God and
[1:21:12] it's
[1:21:13] Malik
[1:21:15] Yahweh the term Malik Yahweh occurs 65
[1:21:20] times in the
[1:21:22] text of the Hebrew Bible
[1:21:26] Malik
[1:21:27] Yahweh so notice the angel of God or the
[1:21:31] angel of the Lord or the angel of his
[1:21:35] presence it's not another being it's
[1:21:39] actually God
[1:21:40] himself there's angels in this church
[1:21:43] today y'all believe that angels are
[1:21:47] right here amongst us this
[1:21:50] morning but yet hundreds of us sitting
[1:21:52] here and probably most of us including
[1:21:54] me will not see them unless God would
[1:21:58] open up a way for me to be able to see
[1:22:01] it and we've seen several Angels here in
[1:22:03] the church since we've been here
[1:22:05] already but that's only possible if God
[1:22:09] would somehow open our eyes and to let
[1:22:11] us peer into that Dimension which is
[1:22:14] here
[1:22:15] present so if God would be able to do
[1:22:18] that then we might see one there some
[1:22:21] one here one over here one back there
[1:22:23] one by you one up here they could be all
[1:22:26] over this whole building this
[1:22:27] morning so could also the son of
[1:22:32] man Christ
[1:22:36] Jesus now his
[1:22:38] presence he chooses to reveal himself in
[1:22:42] this way so this term Malik Yahweh can
[1:22:46] mean the angel of the Lord the angel of
[1:22:49] God or the angel of Jehovah now the
[1:22:53] difference between the angel of God and
[1:22:56] an angel of the Lord is that some of the
[1:23:00] Angels were
[1:23:02] created therefore they had a beginning
[1:23:05] the Bible terms some of them of course
[1:23:07] as elect watch in Isaiah 639 in all
[1:23:12] their Affliction he was afflicted I love
[1:23:16] the way Isaiah captures this because he
[1:23:18] brings into view the scenario of the
[1:23:21] children of Israel down in the land of
[1:23:23] Egypt and I'd like to remind you today
[1:23:26] that the Lord is mindful of your
[1:23:28] Affliction he's mindful of all that you
[1:23:30] go through well you say if he's mindful
[1:23:33] of me why don't he take it all off of me
[1:23:35] well there's times that he answers yes
[1:23:37] there's times he says no and there's
[1:23:40] times he says wait a while so if God
[1:23:43] delays it doesn't mean that he's not
[1:23:45] mindful it just means he has a reason or
[1:23:48] a purpose for you going through what
[1:23:50] you're going through anybody say Amen to
[1:23:52] that so this reminds us then of how he
[1:23:55] feels in all their Affliction he was
[1:24:01] afflicted and the angel of his presence
[1:24:05] now here it is again Malik Yahweh the
[1:24:10] angel of his presence now remember this
[1:24:12] is different than Jehovah Adonai or
[1:24:16] Jehovah Shalom Jehovah TI Cano Jehovah
[1:24:20] our Banner Jehovah our righteousness
[1:24:22] Jehovah Shalom Jehovah our peace so it's
[1:24:24] a different attribute of God you say why
[1:24:27] in the world do we need this well you
[1:24:30] might ask Cyro phenician woman the same
[1:24:33] thing when she comes to the Lord Jesus
[1:24:36] and her daughter is possessed with a
[1:24:39] spirit and she says oh thou son of David
[1:24:43] have mercy on me the Lord Jesus never
[1:24:47] even looked her way you know why she was
[1:24:50] calling him by the wrong name
[1:24:55] so if I'm preaching here this morning
[1:24:57] and somebody said preach it brother Jim
[1:25:01] preach it brother Jack preach it brother
[1:25:04] George preach it brother Frank preach it
[1:25:08] sister Carol we'll know you don't belong
[1:25:10] in this
[1:25:14] church we know there's something wrong
[1:25:16] with you you're out a sink right why
[1:25:20] because you're using the wrong name
[1:25:25] you see for those who call upon him
[1:25:28] under the titles of father son Holy
[1:25:31] Ghost how pitiful I know I was once in
[1:25:34] that Darkness I've told you before I
[1:25:36] would pray to the father and then I'd
[1:25:37] pray to the son and then I'd pray to the
[1:25:39] Holy Ghost and then I'd get confused cuz
[1:25:42] I couldn't remember which one I'd prayed
[1:25:43] to the liest and I didn't want either
[1:25:45] one of them to get mad so I'd go through
[1:25:46] the whole routine again well I tell you
[1:25:49] one thing my prayers got a whole lot
[1:25:50] more simple realize there wasn't three
[1:25:52] but there's actually just one after
[1:25:54] after all here oh Israel the Lord our
[1:25:57] God is one and his name is one so you
[1:26:01] see dispensation when the woman calls on
[1:26:04] him as son of David he never even
[1:26:06] answered her a word the Bible says but
[1:26:09] whenever she said
[1:26:12] Lord immediately she got his attention
[1:26:16] because she prayed and ask in the right
[1:26:21] dispensational title this is what the
[1:26:24] prophet tells us in the seals that they
[1:26:27] scream and they holler and they cry and
[1:26:30] they don't get
[1:26:32] nothing come on but it will be revealed
[1:26:36] in the Thunders he
[1:26:39] says I hope you understand the Son of
[1:26:42] God the Holy
[1:26:44] Ghost God gave birth to
[1:26:48] himself a
[1:26:51] son and it's called the Holy Ghost which
[1:26:55] is the Son of God the
[1:26:58] spirit had a
[1:27:00] son well y'all looking at me fun this
[1:27:02] morning if I got jam on my face or
[1:27:04] something like that the spirit had a
[1:27:08] son and God chose to use that
[1:27:11] manifestation down through the church
[1:27:13] ages but a promise in the end time that
[1:27:17] it would
[1:27:18] change and merge back into the son of
[1:27:22] man
[1:27:26] so who is this son of man Brother Don
[1:27:28] you talking about just go ahead and tell
[1:27:29] us playe all right I will it's
[1:27:34] Jesus same one that was the son of God
[1:27:37] same one that died on the cross raised
[1:27:40] from the dead but now appearing himself
[1:27:44] amongst his bride in the last days now
[1:27:47] you see he could not do it in the human
[1:27:50] form because it can only be at one place
[1:27:52] at one time so he could divide himself
[1:27:55] by Spirit they've already had church
[1:27:57] this morning in Africa all over India
[1:28:00] and you know them different parts of the
[1:28:01] world brother the Andre's done completed
[1:28:03] his series of meetings Andrew Glover
[1:28:05] down in Australia and they've done done
[1:28:08] there they're already finished of course
[1:28:09] in New Zealand you cross the
[1:28:10] International Date Line so they're
[1:28:12] already finished in Europe probably
[1:28:14] people from France and Norway and
[1:28:16] England are streaming our service now
[1:28:19] because it's already ahead in their time
[1:28:21] and yet the spirit of God can be healed
[1:28:24] and there and there and there and
[1:28:26] exactly in the same way where in the
[1:28:28] Corporal body if the Lord Jesus would
[1:28:31] have remained in that he could only been
[1:28:33] at one of our churches so you imagine as
[1:28:35] many message churches that they are we
[1:28:38] might have got him once every 10 years
[1:28:40] well he might have wind up being here
[1:28:41] said hey you know what now in the year
[1:28:43] of 1934 or 2034 rather I'll be back to
[1:28:47] your all's church because I I've got to
[1:28:49] go everywhere else to everybody else's
[1:28:51] church and y'all only give me about once
[1:28:53] or twice every 10 years years or so but
[1:28:55] he wanted to make himself in a form to
[1:28:59] where he could be all over the Earth at
[1:29:01] the same time so whether you're in
[1:29:03] Tennessee or Ohio or New Zealand or
[1:29:06] Australia or Singapore or China or
[1:29:09] Russia or Ukraine wherever you are every
[1:29:12] member of the body of Christ got have
[1:29:14] the same baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:18] be able to have the same Authority
[1:29:20] before the presence of God as Peter
[1:29:23] James Jam s and John received on the day
[1:29:26] of
[1:29:28] Pentecost aren't you glad for that and
[1:29:31] in all their Affliction he was afflicted
[1:29:33] and the angel of his presence saved them
[1:29:37] so here we see a foreshadow in the Old
[1:29:38] Testament that the angel of his presence
[1:29:42] is fulfilling the office of Savior
[1:29:46] you'll also find this same Prophet
[1:29:48] saying that it was my right
[1:29:51] hand that brought salvation
[1:29:57] so God makes an angel of his presence
[1:30:02] visible so he can appear
[1:30:05] disappear come down in a meeting
[1:30:07] manifest himself
[1:30:10] disappear you see there's only one human
[1:30:14] body that he permanently resided in and
[1:30:18] it ain't
[1:30:20] mine and it wasn't even brother brandham
[1:30:23] it was
[1:30:25] Jesus but he would come by special
[1:30:29] manifestation he would appear
[1:30:32] disappear now watch what he goes on to
[1:30:34] say and he beared them and carried them
[1:30:37] all the days of old Exodus chapter 2
[1:30:40] verse3 it came to pass in the process of
[1:30:42] time that the king of Egypt died and the
[1:30:44] children of Israel sighed by reason of
[1:30:47] the bondage and they cried and their Cry
[1:30:50] came up unto God by reason of the
[1:30:54] bondage and God heard their groaning and
[1:30:57] God remembered his Covenant with Abraham
[1:31:00] with Isaac and with Jacob Exodus 3:7 and
[1:31:03] the Lord said I have surely seen the
[1:31:06] Affliction of my people which are in
[1:31:09] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[1:31:12] of their taskmasters for I know their
[1:31:15] sorrows and I am come
[1:31:19] down I am come down to deliver them jump
[1:31:23] down to verse 9 now therefore Behold The
[1:31:25] Cry of the children of Israel has come
[1:31:28] unto me I have also seen the oppression
[1:31:31] he is so mindful I'll remind you again
[1:31:33] he's mindful of where you are this
[1:31:36] morning judges chap 10: 16 put it they
[1:31:40] put away the strange Gods from among
[1:31:43] them and they serve the Lord and his
[1:31:47] soul was
[1:31:49] grieved for the
[1:31:51] misery of Israel
[1:31:55] God has a
[1:31:58] soul his soul was grieve Jeremiah 31:20
[1:32:03] is Ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant
[1:32:06] child for sin I spake against him I do
[1:32:09] earnestly remember him still therefore
[1:32:12] my bows are troubled for him I will
[1:32:16] surely have mercy upon Him saith the
[1:32:20] Lord what does it tell us friends God is
[1:32:22] mindful he's mindful of where we are he
[1:32:27] knows we need more than the anointing of
[1:32:30] Pentecost to make a
[1:32:33] Rapture if the returning of the gifts is
[1:32:36] all we need to produce a Rapture why did
[1:32:40] not it happen in ausa
[1:32:42] street that Pentecostal move that broke
[1:32:45] all those years ago it went around the
[1:32:48] world there were preachers that were
[1:32:51] praying for the sick they were raising
[1:32:53] the Dead it was a Revival that was so
[1:32:56] phenomenal they would gather together 50
[1:32:59] 60 70 100,000 people in one setting we
[1:33:03] never have touched that and to be honest
[1:33:06] with you never will because that's not
[1:33:09] our dispensation but yet it seems as if
[1:33:13] though some think that was the greater
[1:33:17] glory it's like comparing Solomon's
[1:33:20] Temple to the human Temple of the Lord
[1:33:22] Jesus what the presence of God came down
[1:33:26] and the glory was so great that the
[1:33:28] priest could not Minister H yet which of
[1:33:31] the temples was the greatest that one
[1:33:34] there that Solomon built or that human
[1:33:37] one standing there when John baptized
[1:33:39] him in the river that day it would seem
[1:33:41] to the human eye that God displayed a
[1:33:44] greater manifestation in Solomon's time
[1:33:47] that he did it the water that day but
[1:33:50] that was God's ultimate achievement in
[1:33:53] that house of God many want us to go
[1:33:55] back to Pentecost they want us to go
[1:33:58] back to a former glory but I'll tell you
[1:34:01] right now the bride will never go
[1:34:03] through or take a Rapture by us
[1:34:06] returning to isua street we have got to
[1:34:10] have a dispensation of God in the last
[1:34:14] day that's going to take us higher than
[1:34:17] healing our
[1:34:19] bodies oh
[1:34:22] Hallelujah now this in Zechariah 28 for
[1:34:25] thus sayith the Lord of hosts after the
[1:34:27] glory hasth he sent me unto the Nations
[1:34:30] which spoiled you for he that toucheth
[1:34:33] you toucheth the
[1:34:36] apple of his
[1:34:39] eye acts 9:4 and he fell to the Earth
[1:34:43] and heard a voice saying unto him Saul
[1:34:45] Saul why persecutest thou me and he said
[1:34:50] who art thou Lord and the Lord said I I
[1:34:54] am Jesus whom thou persecutest and yet
[1:34:57] he was not touching the Lord Jesus
[1:34:59] himself he was touching his Tabernacles
[1:35:02] on the earth So what had God done he had
[1:35:06] changed
[1:35:07] himself oh my notice let's skip down
[1:35:10] there Brothers Beyond this next
[1:35:11] scripture so the angel of God's presence
[1:35:15] or his face which is God's nature also I
[1:35:20] found this in studying this week to
[1:35:22] express image of the person of God is
[1:35:27] Isel i t h i eel is a the word that was
[1:35:35] with God and always was God and yet
[1:35:40] projected out of him not as another
[1:35:42] being now going out of him but himself
[1:35:45] changing himself changing his garments 2
[1:35:49] Corinthians 4:3 if our gospel be hid it
[1:35:52] is hid to them
[1:35:54] that
[1:35:55] are lost in whom the God of this world
[1:35:58] have blinded the minds of them which
[1:36:00] believe not lest the light of the
[1:36:02] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:36:06] image of God should shine unto them here
[1:36:11] is the image of God for God is
[1:36:17] invisible oh lord for we preach not
[1:36:22] ourselves oh we some of the message
[1:36:24] preachers could read this scripture
[1:36:26] right here and start applying it well we
[1:36:29] don't preach ourselves well come on
[1:36:32] brother Donnie we preach not ourselves
[1:36:35] but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves
[1:36:41] your servants for Jesus sake for God who
[1:36:46] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:36:48] Darkness ha shined in our hearts to give
[1:36:51] the light of the knowledge
[1:36:54] of the glory of God the light of the
[1:36:58] knowledge of the glory of God in
[1:37:03] what the
[1:37:05] face of Jesus
[1:37:09] Christ so God's glory was made manifest
[1:37:14] here is God's
[1:37:16] paum in the New Testament the angel of
[1:37:19] his presence was Jesus notice Colossians
[1:37:22] 1:15 who is the image of the
[1:37:27] invisible God right so the visibility of
[1:37:31] the invisible God was
[1:37:35] Jesus so he could appear in this room
[1:37:38] right here
[1:37:41] now and remain totally
[1:37:44] invisible unless he opened our eyes or
[1:37:50] unless he allowed that imminence of his
[1:37:53] being
[1:37:55] to start moving on our
[1:37:58] emotions I know some of you are think
[1:38:01] wow emotion yeah you already hear them
[1:38:03] quotes I was reading to Carol last night
[1:38:05] about brother B talking about the
[1:38:06] presence of God moving on the emotions
[1:38:09] of the people and he'd watch it as it
[1:38:11] would move on the emotions of the people
[1:38:14] and it was the angel of God and he said
[1:38:16] it would pull them on their emotions and
[1:38:19] get them to a spot where they could
[1:38:21] receive something from the Lord
[1:38:25] we're human beings and we have emotions
[1:38:27] ain't nothing wrong with having emotions
[1:38:28] as long as the Holy Ghost is in control
[1:38:30] of
[1:38:31] them now watch so here God let the light
[1:38:35] shine in the face of Jesus Christ and
[1:38:38] then Paul goes on to say he is the image
[1:38:39] of the invisible God the firstborn of
[1:38:41] every creature so the love of God
[1:38:44] revealed in Christ he was the visible
[1:38:48] representative of the invisible God 1
[1:38:51] Timothy 1:1 17 now unto the
[1:38:55] king
[1:38:56] Eternal
[1:38:58] Immortal
[1:39:01] invisible the only wise God be honor and
[1:39:07] Glory

[1:39:32] Eternal that's the way they knew him
[1:39:34] before they found out what his name
[1:39:37] was you see when he manifest himself to
[1:39:40] Moses he said I was made known to
[1:39:42] Abraham by this and by and but to Jacob
[1:39:44] by this and that he said but by my name

[1:40:04] El

[1:40:11] Elohim but he must bear the name of God
[1:40:14] that God says this is where I'm
[1:40:18] known I am that I am not I was that I
[1:40:24] was or I wish I was but I am that I
[1:40:28] am now remember who we talking about
[1:40:31] brother dony what are you trying to say
[1:40:32] I'm trying to get you to see who's in
[1:40:35] our midst
[1:40:37] today it's not just a repeat a Pentecost
[1:40:42] it's not a going back to methodism or
[1:40:45] baptism it is the Lord Jesus
[1:40:49] himself being in our midst anointing his
[1:40:53] men with his own presence to pull you
[1:40:57] out of the world and out of the darkness
[1:41:00] and eventually pull you out of
[1:41:03] yourself hallelujah king Eternal
[1:41:07] literally this word Malika oim is King
[1:41:12] of the ages King
[1:41:16] Eternal oh my and many of the Jewish
[1:41:19] blessings listen this which are usually
[1:41:21] rendered King of the the universe which
[1:41:24] is where they would use this Hebrew word
[1:41:27] now unto the king Eternal Immortal
[1:41:30] invisible invisible in contrast to the
[1:41:33] visible creation and also invisible in
[1:41:37] contrast to the visible Idols that man
[1:41:41] makes so your car your house your wife
[1:41:44] your husband your preacher your church
[1:41:46] every one of the idols that you've got
[1:41:47] in your life what are they they've all
[1:41:49] got a visible appearance your house come
[1:41:52] on somebody say amen your house your car
[1:41:55] your job think of all the things that we
[1:41:57] make Idols in our life and none of them
[1:41:59] have the power of invisibility there's
[1:42:03] only one there's only one who has this
[1:42:07] type of power oh my can I have a few
[1:42:09] more minutes 1 Timothy again chap 6
[1:42:13] verse 16 who only hasth
[1:42:18] immortality dwelling in the light now
[1:42:21] remember he's the only be being that in
[1:42:24] the essence of himself is Immortal he's
[1:42:29] the only being that in the essence of
[1:42:33] himself is Immortal well you say brother
[1:42:36] Donnie we got eternal life that's right
[1:42:37] we do but we don't have it of ourself
[1:42:41] the devil does not have it of himself
[1:42:44] Angels did not have it of himself he's
[1:42:47] the only one the Eternal that has
[1:42:51] eternal life of him s oh I wish somebody
[1:42:54] would hear me this morning oh blessed be
[1:42:57] the Lord God who only has
[1:43:00] immortality dwelling in the light which
[1:43:05] no man can
[1:43:07] approach
[1:43:09] unto Moses himself could only see a
[1:43:13] symbol of divine presence but the face
[1:43:16] of God has no man ever seen because he's
[1:43:21] infinite eternal and invisible how in
[1:43:25] the world are we ever going to get
[1:43:26] married to
[1:43:30] him so his his being is
[1:43:35] incomprehensible to
[1:43:38] us what if it's incomprehensible to our
[1:43:41] mind to be able to perceive it it would
[1:43:44] be totally incomprehensible for our
[1:43:47] eyes to pick him
[1:43:51] up unless of course he
[1:43:54] changed
[1:43:57] himself so if say he wanted to get
[1:44:03] married it would be up to him
[1:44:06] to make a
[1:44:09] form to get married
[1:44:13] in and one that we could be able to look
[1:44:17] at him reach over and take a hold of his
[1:44:20] hand and love him and
[1:44:26] touching you see we
[1:44:29] cannot directly look at the Sun for very
[1:44:34] long without causing us to go blind is
[1:44:39] that right now even though the sun is
[1:44:44] approximately
[1:44:45] 93 million
[1:44:48] miles from the
[1:44:51] earth yeah there could be a solar storm
[1:44:54] on the sun and it will cause our
[1:44:56] internet to drop out it will cause
[1:45:01] cycles and phases in our electric
[1:45:03] electric energy and our power and all
[1:45:05] that to Surge we just had one just a
[1:45:07] month or so ago you remember about it
[1:45:09] and they wasn't sure exactly what would
[1:45:10] happened but if we went today and we
[1:45:13] stood outside in the full sun and we
[1:45:14] looked and we looked and we looked
[1:45:16] eventually we would go blind by looking
[1:45:19] at
[1:45:20] it and yet the glory of the
[1:45:24] sun is not exactly the same thing as the
[1:45:28] Sun but you can hardly separate the
[1:45:31] two so God must make a form and come out
[1:45:35] of his glory now watch The Mighty God
[1:45:38] unveil before us talking about Moses he
[1:45:40] desired to see him one day and God told
[1:45:42] him go stand on the Rock and while
[1:45:44] standing on the Rock Moses seen him pass
[1:45:46] and he saw the back of a man and it
[1:45:48] looked like a man a man's back yet he
[1:45:53] did not see
[1:45:54] God he only seen the veil of
[1:45:59] God and you see the veil is always what
[1:46:03] blinds
[1:46:05] people don't you know if they would have
[1:46:08] known the Lord Jesus and they would have
[1:46:09] be able to look at him and say from his
[1:46:12] image come just penetrating rays of
[1:46:15] light and you couldn't even get around
[1:46:16] him oh my you know oh that that all know
[1:46:19] oh yes yes yes that's a mighty God
[1:46:21] that's that's Supernatural but father
[1:46:23] stepped from that when he stepped into
[1:46:26] that human
[1:46:28] Temple and they saw him cry like a man
[1:46:31] they saw him weep at the tomb of Lazarus
[1:46:33] they saw him set outside the city when
[1:46:36] he raised the Widow from name son and
[1:46:38] grown with a headache and they saw him
[1:46:41] take upon himself our human Affliction
[1:46:44] and they could not see the great rays
[1:46:46] that projected from him and all they saw
[1:46:49] was a man but he hid God
[1:46:53] same with
[1:46:54] you same with me same with his prophet
[1:46:59] in this
[1:47:00] day now notice the Bible said no man has
[1:47:03] seen God at any time but the only
[1:47:05] begotten of the father had declared him
[1:47:06] so Moses saw him veiled as a man now we
[1:47:09] find that Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:47:11] with Jesus of the New Testament Dr scord
[1:47:13] here we find that his word changing from
[1:47:16] form so we find the word
[1:47:18] imor in Greek it means the Unseen was
[1:47:22] made visible something we know it's
[1:47:25] there it cannot be seen but yet you know
[1:47:27] it's there and when the change is formed
[1:47:30] the amorph which mean that it changed
[1:47:33] from
[1:47:34] Supernatural to
[1:47:36] Natural so when it changed from
[1:47:38] Supernatural to Natural then we oh okay
[1:47:41] I I see that I I I see that yeah right I
[1:47:44] I can see that now so when was it real
[1:47:48] or truth when you saw it or was it not
[1:47:52] the same essence of Truth before you saw
[1:47:54] it you understand it was truth before
[1:47:57] you ever saw it it was reality before
[1:48:00] you ever saw it but you were just
[1:48:02] allowed to see it at a certain time you
[1:48:05] see God dwells in that infinite Glory
[1:48:08] which no man has ever seen no man has
[1:48:12] ever seen it God out of that Glory has
[1:48:16] to Step Beyond That Glory or it would
[1:48:19] blind even the elected
[1:48:26] let me close here
[1:48:29] shortly so the son of
[1:48:32] man had to come in the last days now
[1:48:34] remember I'm talking about
[1:48:38] Jesus but it would appear again in an
[1:48:42] Old Testament
[1:48:44] form it would be a
[1:48:47] light say look about like that taken
[1:48:51] over somebody's head
[1:48:54] then it would be that was a fire by
[1:48:56] night in Houston in
[1:48:59] 1950 then it would appear in
[1:49:03] 1963 as a
[1:49:05] cloud by
[1:49:08] day same God that's right well praise
[1:49:12] the lord well you say brother Donnie
[1:49:15] where is
[1:49:16] he he's still
[1:49:19] here well where well one place right
[1:49:22] here this morning he's been over in
[1:49:25] France as I said he's been in Africa
[1:49:27] he's been in India already this day
[1:49:29] nurturing and Gathering his people
[1:49:32] together to allow them to feed on his
[1:49:37] unfailing body word so you see what an
[1:49:41] an opportunity and yet a responsibility
[1:49:43] that preachers have to try to bring
[1:49:46] something to the people that you can be
[1:49:49] able to Feast on something that is great
[1:49:53] than us oh you I could never sat under a
[1:49:55] preacher that talked over the top of my
[1:49:57] head so in other words all you want me
[1:49:59] to preach is everything that you
[1:50:04] know someone told me some time ago it's
[1:50:06] been a good good while back and they
[1:50:08] said you know I I I go to this certain
[1:50:10] certain church here because because uh
[1:50:13] my my pastor and me is on the same level
[1:50:15] I said he never preaches above you oh no
[1:50:16] no no no he preaches right where I'm at
[1:50:18] I said how you ever going to grow in God
[1:50:21] how in the world are you ever going to
[1:50:22] go and got it if your first grade
[1:50:24] teacher taught you first grade stuff and
[1:50:28] then your second grade teacher taught
[1:50:30] you what your first grade teacher got
[1:50:32] you and then your third grade teacher
[1:50:34] taught you what your first grade teacher
[1:50:36] and on and on and on and you come up to
[1:50:39] the 12th grade and you've heard first
[1:50:42] grade stuff for the last 12 years and
[1:50:45] now you're going to college come on you
[1:50:48] got to be kidding me so some people want
[1:50:52] said under that type of a Ministry a lot
[1:50:55] of made him call in the first place and
[1:50:57] they're still telling us how to get
[1:50:58] saved I don't need to know how to get
[1:51:01] saved I got saved years ago I don't need
[1:51:05] to know how to get Sanctified I know how
[1:51:07] to get Sanctified I want to get out of
[1:51:10] this world because it's fixing to be
[1:51:14] blown up by atomic bombs I've got to
[1:51:17] have a message that will change my body
[1:51:21] it ain't enough to tell me about the
[1:51:23] cross tell me about the man that changed
[1:51:27] [Applause]
[1:51:35] himself so can you imagine the valid
[1:51:37] dictorian
[1:51:41] of that
[1:51:45] class so he's going to stand up there
[1:51:48] and he's going to drag out his primer
[1:51:50] book we sure always glad all come
[1:51:53] today man I'm telling you what we've
[1:51:56] been through 12 years of Hell on this
[1:51:58] Earth Lord have mercy I remember it was
[1:52:02] 1+ one and 1+ one and then they moved us
[1:52:05] up to 2 plus two I want to tell you one
[1:52:08] thing I've been in this whole s school
[1:52:10] system for the last 12 years and I'll
[1:52:13] tell you what I know 1 + one is two and
[1:52:16] 2 + 2 is four and that's how come I'm
[1:52:19] the valid dictorian cuz nobody else
[1:52:22] didn't know what one plus one was but
[1:52:25] what do you do when you're picking out
[1:52:27] the valedictorian you don't pick out the
[1:52:29] guy but only went to school for lunch
[1:52:32] you don't pick out the girl that only
[1:52:33] went to school to find a boyfriend and
[1:52:36] for recess but you find those that have
[1:52:38] excelled above what everybody else
[1:52:40] excelled at that's why they're called
[1:52:43] the valid dictorian and they're able to
[1:52:45] stand up there and you can tell by
[1:52:47] listening to them they know more than
[1:52:49] one plus one well I'm going to tell you
[1:52:51] tonight God is the only one that can
[1:52:53] take one plus one plus one and the
[1:52:56] answer is still one because he ain't
[1:52:59] three he ain't four he ain't five but he
[1:53:02] is one Deuteronomy 4:35 unto thee it was
[1:53:07] show that thou mightest know that the
[1:53:09] Lord he is God and he is here looking
[1:53:13] for a bride that he can get inside out
[1:53:17] that he can walk through he can heal
[1:53:19] through he can live through and he and
[1:53:24] Mary Hallelujah and then he will bring
[1:53:28] your
[1:53:32] invisibility cuz you
[1:53:34] see there's also a part of
[1:53:38] us that's
[1:53:48] invisible I don't have this essence
[1:53:52] of my own the invisibility
[1:53:57] part but many years ago I was down in
[1:54:00] Kentucky still living there we had been
[1:54:02] to the message in a few years me and
[1:54:05] Carol lived in a single wide
[1:54:07] trailer I was on the far end where the
[1:54:09] bedroom
[1:54:10] was and I heard a noise down the
[1:54:16] hall and I looked down that
[1:54:19] hallway and I saw me
[1:54:23] in another
[1:54:27] form I
[1:54:30] heard from my
[1:54:36] theophany I figured after I got the end
[1:54:38] the service y'all think I was a nut so
[1:54:40] if you want to vote me out it's
[1:54:44] okay if we are part of
[1:54:47] him there's a part of us that never died
[1:54:52] can never
[1:54:53] die there's a part of us that never
[1:54:57] started it actually is it word brother R
[1:55:00] rotated off of his being there's a part
[1:55:04] of him inside of you today that is total
[1:55:09] invisibility and you know as well as I
[1:55:11] do science has looked at this movie
[1:55:13] makers have looked at it they've looked
[1:55:16] at that invisible part making man to
[1:55:18] walk through walls make man to do this
[1:55:21] that other Hollywood's done it years and
[1:55:22] years ago why cuz there was a truce
[1:55:25] laying there can you imagine the Lord
[1:55:28] Jesus and the apostles are gathered
[1:55:30] together and they're there still
[1:55:31] mourning and talking about all the
[1:55:32] different things and the Lord Jesus just
[1:55:34] walks right through the
[1:55:37] wall in a glorified body how do you
[1:55:40] reckon the Saints on Resurrection
[1:55:42] morning is going to walk in your house
[1:55:44] you think they're going to ring the
[1:55:47] doorbell when the prophet said you're
[1:55:49] standing there and all of a sudden they
[1:55:51] appeared
[1:55:52] before you so you see their bodies is so
[1:55:56] moved up and stepped up that they're no
[1:56:00] longer hindered by tues and insulation
[1:56:04] and brick and stone and vinyl Hallelujah
[1:56:08] I'll tell you one thing I've said it
[1:56:09] before I'm going to have a bunch show up
[1:56:11] at my house on Resurrection morning I
[1:56:13] buried a lot of saints down through the
[1:56:16] age I plan on saying a whole bunch of
[1:56:18] them I am going to have a jubilee that
[1:56:21] may be one of the things that pushes me
[1:56:23] p over the
[1:56:25] edge where I'm going to be chained
[1:56:27] because I'll see sister clark come down
[1:56:29] to the oh Lord help us she'll say oh
[1:56:32] Lord help us here we come there'll be
[1:56:34] one after the other after the other
[1:56:37] there's going to be my beautiful little
[1:56:39] daughter after she visits your all's
[1:56:40] house Lance I give you credit for that
[1:56:42] there she's going to step into mine and
[1:56:44] Carol's bathroom or bedroom or wherever
[1:56:46] we are mama and daddy let's go home
[1:56:50] Hallelujah what's going to happen I am
[1:56:52] going to be chained by the power of God
[1:56:56] I won't have to raise the garage door I
[1:56:59] won't have to open the front door or the
[1:57:01] back door or climb out of window but my
[1:57:04] body will be transformed and I will walk
[1:57:08] right through that wall why because
[1:57:11] visibility and invisibility have merged
[1:57:15] together I have taken on the image of my
[1:57:20] husband
[1:57:21] [Applause]
[1:57:32] let's stand I ain't got enough time
[1:57:34] going
[1:57:38] on Psalms 104:2 who coverest
[1:57:42] thyself with
[1:57:45] light as with a
[1:57:47] garment who stretches out the
[1:57:50] heavens like a
[1:57:53] curtain you know
[1:57:55] scientists have increased now what they
[1:57:58] feel like the number of stars are in the
[1:58:01] known
[1:58:03] Galaxy to one
[1:58:06] septian anybody know what that number is
[1:58:09] that is a one with
[1:58:12] 21
[1:58:18] zeros but a few years ago they estimated
[1:58:20] it'd be so many thousand so many
[1:58:22] millions it's amazing how science is
[1:58:25] moving on and we're in that astronaut
[1:58:31] age praise the
[1:58:33] Lord and yet some folks has want to take
[1:58:37] us back to the
[1:58:40] airplane I'll tell you one thing I don't
[1:58:42] like flying maybe some of y'all do
[1:58:44] brother Allan butcher which flew the 767
[1:58:46] he told me brother Donnie it ain't
[1:58:48] natural to fly and I thought if this is
[1:58:50] a Delta pilot telling me that
[1:58:53] Jesus said lo I be with
[1:58:56] you a lot of them want to take us back
[1:58:58] to the 737 days in the 747 days the
[1:59:02] prophet has already G us the countdown

[1:59:12] on somebody don't get quiet don't get
[1:59:14] mad you know I believe in a Pentecostal
[1:59:16] experience but I am not going to take
[1:59:18] you back to isusa street we have moved
[1:59:21] Beyond that it never produced a Rapture
[1:59:24] in their day and it ain't going to
[1:59:26] produce it now but here we are in the
[1:59:28] astronaut tube and the countdown is
[1:59:31] going we're done past Ephesus samna
[1:59:34] pergamus we're done past all that where
[1:59:36] are we right at the very last remember
[1:59:39] remember the Ephesian Church age didn't

[2:00:15] even have a written bible that's right
[2:00:18] they raised the dead they healed the
[2:00:20] sick they cast out devils what was it
[2:00:22] the invisible Lord Jesus making himself
[2:00:25] visible look the bride age is not a new
[2:00:28] age it's not a separate age where we
[2:00:29] have to have a separate messenger it was
[2:00:32] that space of time before the church age
[2:00:34] began here we are when leosia and the
[2:00:36] bride age where we are last right at the
[2:00:38] very end time this last little section

[2:03:03] facts of
[2:03:09] God
[2:03:11] hallelujah and the
[2:03:14] bride is the
[2:03:16] facts of
[2:03:20] Jesus so God from Heaven faxed himself
[2:03:25] down on the earth in human
[2:03:27] form and on the day of Pentecost in the
[2:03:30] upper room the Lord Jesus said it's time
[2:03:34] for me to do what Daddy did what my
[2:03:36] father done now I'm going to fax
[2:03:38] myself so he faxed himself down in the
[2:03:41] day of
[2:03:42] Pentecost and they were all filled with
[2:03:44] the Holy
[2:03:45] Ghost oh children if you ain't got it
[2:03:48] today don't leave this place without
[2:03:50] it don't you love him with all your
[2:03:57] heart as the brightness of the sun is of
[2:03:59] the same nature as the Sun so when the
[2:04:02] sun came upon the Earth he kept talking
[2:04:05] about it talk about and Philip finally
[2:04:06] said Lord show us the father and it'll
[2:04:11] suffice us or or
[2:04:14] satisfies Jesus said have I been so long
[2:04:17] time with you and you don't know who I
[2:04:20] am
[2:04:24] let me close with
[2:04:26] this Sol in prison paragraph
[2:04:30] 116 may I put it like
[2:04:34] this the
[2:04:36] ministry of Jesus
[2:04:39] Christ
[2:04:41] reincarnated in his
[2:04:44] church in the last
[2:04:47] day that's what many of us
[2:04:50] believe I I
[2:04:53] believe with
[2:04:56] you don't you understand these poor
[2:04:58] blind message people when they speak
[2:05:01] against God's
[2:05:03] Ministry don't you us understand there
[2:05:05] they're going to stand before God and
[2:05:08] the Lord Jesus is going to judge them
[2:05:10] not because they rejected Donnie Reagan
[2:05:12] Daryl Ward Pete Lawson you know John
[2:05:15] Horn y some these other preachers
[2:05:17] brother Michael brother Joe no they
[2:05:20] rejected Jesus Christ Christ cuz it's
[2:05:24] him in another
[2:05:27] form it's him and
[2:05:30] you in Bride
[2:05:35] form
[2:05:37] Hallelujah my wife standing here

[2:05:46] better I thank you for

[2:05:52] frame I've had to preach on how many
[2:05:54] times and you know I've been dealing
[2:05:55] with all kinds of burdens all kinds of
[2:05:56] this that and the other but if you only
[2:05:59] had five minutes a day to pray I'd
[2:06:01] rather you pray for her than you would
[2:06:03] for
[2:06:05] me that's the way I feel about
[2:06:08] her so the way you treat the wife of the
[2:06:11] Lord Jesus yes sir imagine when you

[2:06:33] floor and one of my
[2:06:35] churches
[2:06:37] over in
[2:06:39] Zimbabwe cuz my children had been going
[2:06:41] to church there for about 12
[2:06:44] years and all they had was a dirt
[2:06:47] floor and every time they'd go to
[2:06:50] shouting it was a LED of red dust moving
[2:06:52] through that place and they'd get all
[2:06:55] choked up boy they had a hard
[2:06:58] time I want to thank you for doing
[2:07:01] that cuz when you paid for that concrete
[2:07:04] floor in there you done that for me oh

[2:07:24] Uganda
[2:07:26] yeah and I won't tell you how many
[2:07:32] more and one day when we stand before
[2:07:34] the
[2:07:36] Lord you think I want to get the credit
[2:07:38] for all
[2:07:39] that I'm simply just a funnel let it go
[2:07:44] soon you're going to stand up pray for
[2:07:46] the Lord and say thank you for building
[2:07:48] that church for me thank you for
[2:07:50] building that church as over in
[2:07:54] India they got churches over in India
[2:07:56] and Africa and all over the world called
[2:07:59] Happy Valley they need to update don't
[2:08:03] they I got an email from one of the
[2:08:05] brothers not long ago said brother
[2:08:06] Donnie why'd y'all change the name of
[2:08:07] your church I said well brother the name
[2:08:10] of the church was Happy Valley because
[2:08:12] that was the community that we lived in
[2:08:15] but we still carry the same spiritualism
[2:08:17] even though we change the name cuz we're
[2:08:19] still happy in the valley when we do get
[2:08:21] down in the valley so I said okay well
[2:08:24] praise the Lord now I understand
[2:08:26] why think of it when you walk before
[2:08:32] God and the books are open and
[2:08:35] everything there to your account you say
[2:08:38] I never done
[2:08:39] that I never even and he'll say when you
[2:08:43] done it to the least of
[2:08:45] these you done it to me
[2:08:51] don't you love him
[2:08:54] church I wish we could keep that in our
[2:08:56] mind every day I think we treat one
[2:08:59] another
[2:09:01] nicer I think we'd be more lovely and
[2:09:04] more you know the way the Lord wants us
[2:09:07] to
[2:09:09] BEP
[2:09:13] it Lord
[2:09:18] Jesus father how we
[2:09:22] what do we
[2:09:25] say the great almighty
[2:09:29] God in our midst
[2:09:34] today we must be getting closer and
[2:09:36] closer to going
[2:09:39] home for you want us to be
[2:09:42] AED by your
[2:09:44] presence I know there's probably some
[2:09:46] here today saying oh I come to church
[2:09:48] going through the Office trial ever was
[2:09:50] and I was looking for a word from God
[2:09:52] and man he didn't already say nothing
[2:09:53] about what I thought he should
[2:09:55] say job probably thought the same thing
[2:09:58] whenever you come down and said job I
[2:10:01] want you to stand up and G yourself like
[2:10:03] a man CU I'm going to speak to
[2:10:05] you and you said where was you when I
[2:10:08] laid the foundations of the
[2:10:10] earth and you begin to climb above job
[2:10:14] as it was as Papa eagle and show him
[2:10:17] your strength and your
[2:10:19] might that actually lifted job out of
[2:10:23] his trial where he
[2:10:26] was Lord as I've been studying on this
[2:10:28] this week I have just been
[2:10:32] overwhelmed to think that such a being
[2:10:36] would even take time from
[2:10:39] me a being so
[2:10:43] awesome that he has eternal life on his
[2:10:46] own
[2:10:48] Essence that he's so great that angels
[2:10:52] would look dirty to
[2:10:54] him he's so great that he has to step
[2:10:57] down and step down and step down and
[2:10:59] step down again and
[2:11:02] again for humans to even to start
[2:11:05] comprehending him a little
[2:11:08] bit and yet as we read in the scriptures
[2:11:12] when your people will go into
[2:11:14] hardships you will burdened
[2:11:17] for I pray you'd help each one here
[2:11:19] today Father to realize
[2:11:24] I ask you father that those that have
[2:11:27] lost loved ones I know some are still
[2:11:29] grieving
[2:11:30] some's still grieving for several years
[2:11:33] after their husbands or their wives have
[2:11:35] been
[2:11:37] taken and sometime they may feel you're
[2:11:39] so far
[2:11:41] away but may these scriptures that we've
[2:11:43] shared with them today help them to
[2:11:46] realize I cannot believe that you look
[2:11:50] at the Agony and the loneliness of
[2:11:52] sister Linda Nunley and sister Linda bab
[2:11:57] and brother Tom horac
[2:12:00] and children that have lost their mom I
[2:12:03] can't believe that you look at the
[2:12:04] Parker girls and Lance
[2:12:07] and it does not move your
[2:12:12] heart I can't believe that you look at
[2:12:14] my
[2:12:16] wife as we were driving down the road
[2:12:19] the other day and she bursted out in
[2:12:20] tears
[2:12:21] years and said I'd give anything to see
[2:12:27] her and as I looked across the car and I
[2:12:31] thought God I wish I was something I
[2:12:33] could
[2:12:34] say but how can I when I'm feeling the
[2:12:37] same
[2:12:39] way but I think we know you well enough
[2:12:42] to know that when we go through these
[2:12:44] things you're
[2:12:46] moved it's not like that you're this
[2:12:48] great Eternal that don't even con
[2:12:51] concern himself with our problems and
[2:12:54] our losses in
[2:12:56] life sometimes Jesus we just need to
[2:12:59] know that you care hallelujah oh great
[2:13:04] Jehovah

[2:13:26] them there Lord

[2:13:34] mysterious this is what makes you so
[2:13:37] great to

[2:13:42] about
[2:13:44] us father we long to be where you

[2:14:01] funerals losing my mama my daddy my

[2:18:45] today that have just as much Holy Ghost
[2:18:47] as I've got and you're just as ordained
[2:18:50] into eternal
[2:18:53] life praise the Lord Jesus the prophet
[2:18:57] would have people to do this and he
[2:18:58] would say eagle to
[2:19:03] Eagle thank you Lord God maybe that
[2:19:07] eagle you got your hands on they're in a
[2:19:10] very low spot in their life it's been
[2:19:12] many days since they felt the presence
[2:19:15] of the Lord they've been going through
[2:19:17] such a dark
[2:19:19] Valley they're beak is all crusted over
[2:19:22] as Brother David soer spoke to us
[2:19:24] several weeks ago when he was
[2:19:26] here they can't rise to fly and make a
[2:19:29] fresh
[2:19:31] kill but it might be through your prayer
[2:19:34] today that the Lord Jesus we just let
[2:19:37] the anointing Channel Through
[2:19:39] you while you're praying for
[2:19:43] him let's pray together shall
[2:19:46] we now Lord we're not asking you for
[2:19:48] ourselves
[2:19:50] we're praying for one
[2:19:53] another Lord Jesus I'm asking you as the
[2:19:56] shepherd be mindful of my sheep
[2:19:59] today those that you have committed to
[2:20:02] my charge Lord God I realize in one way
[2:20:06] I stand in a dreadful place
[2:20:10] today for a man to have to answer for
[2:20:13] one more soul of another individual
[2:20:16] other than himself it's such a fearful
[2:20:19] thing and yet Lord there's hundreds of
[2:20:21] souls here today that I've got to stand
[2:20:24] before you and answer
[2:20:26] for I don't approach it LLY Lord I
[2:20:29] approach it with
[2:20:31] reverence fear in my heart I would to
[2:20:33] God it was not my
[2:20:35] place but Lord Jesus it's Fallen my lot
[2:20:39] so I'm standing here with them now
[2:20:41] father in your
[2:20:43] presence and we have our hands laid one
[2:20:45] upon the other maybe there's some that's
[2:20:48] sick some that's weary
[2:20:51] Lord maybe some of them it's been a long
[2:20:53] time since they felt your
[2:20:55] presence they've been going through a
[2:20:57] real low spot lately
[2:20:59] Lord would you just come by Lord
[2:21:03] Jesus would you come near him today
[2:21:05] Father and just let them know that you
[2:21:08] still love them you still care for them
[2:21:11] Minister healing Minister

[2:21:21] thank you
[2:21:23] Lord thank you
[2:21:26] Lord Praise Your Holy Name
[2:21:29] father now we lift our voices to you and
[2:21:33] say thank
[2:21:35] you we believe you Lord that there will
[2:21:37] be people that will be testifying that
[2:21:41] they got healed right here in this
[2:21:43] service
[2:21:44] today they don't even have to have a
[2:21:46] preacher to lay hand on them sure we
[2:21:48] will do that if that's what the that's
[2:21:50] the ction of their
[2:21:51] face but I believe eventually whenever
[2:21:55] that time will hit the earth we will
[2:21:58] bring people to a place that they'll be
[2:22:01] able to believe as the Centurion did
[2:22:04] speak the word and my servant will
[2:22:08] live Lord God May that happen in Word of
[2:22:12] Life Lord Jesus May that anointing so
[2:22:16] strick our
[2:22:18] hearts that we don't have to have a
[2:22:20] visit Visible man with a visible suit on
[2:22:22] with a visible tie and a visible
[2:22:25] preacher oh I know sometimes we need the
[2:22:27] god of skin on it but Lord may my faith
[2:22:31] rise to that realm of
[2:22:34] invisibility that I can touch an
[2:22:37] invisible
[2:22:38] God that my faith Lord Jesus for
[2:22:41] whatever I have need of can bring it to
[2:22:44] me today
