[28:31] Jesus you get a make it cuz he already
[28:35] said we were going to Amen
[28:39] heard it said he took a picture of us
[28:42] took a picture
[28:43] long before with it we ever started in
[28:46] this existence God already had a perfect
[28:48] image of you of me of our family of our
[28:53] inheritance our children and he never
[28:56] takes his eye off that perfect picture
[28:58] and his purpose in his will is to bring
[29:01] you to that image I want to say Lord
[29:03] bring me to that image bring me to that
[29:06] image that perfect image that you had
[29:08] before the foundation of the world amen
[29:11] praise the Lord Jesus if you have your
[29:13] Bible we'll turn to the book of John
[29:14] chapter 10 John chapter 10 Amen brothers
[29:21] I have a PowerPoint that I sent you if
[29:23] you have it a man you could just have
[29:25] that ready
[29:39] have a few scriptures that will read and
[29:43] then we'll just have you be seated John
[29:45] chapter ten
[29:46] what does have you turned there and
[29:49] we'll begin looking at verse 10 John
[29:53] chapter 10 you love the Lord
[29:56] you appreciate his word last night amen
[30:00] I pray that it was a blessing and just
[30:02] felt to go and to continue in the same
[30:04] direction that we were last night and
[30:07] just continue in that same channel and
[30:09] that same thought the Lord's just had
[30:10] this upon my heart amen and just want to
[30:13] carry right on amen John chapter 10
[30:16] verse 10 we'll begin reading here let's
[30:19] actually start at verse 7 then said
[30:22] Jesus unto them again verily verily I
[30:25] say unto you I am the door of the Sheep
[30:28] all that ever came before me are thieves
[30:31] and robbers but the Sheep did not hear
[30:36] them I am the door By Me If any man
[30:39] enter in he shall be saved and shall go
[30:43] in and out and find pasture the thief
[30:47] cometh not but here's why the thief
[30:50] comes but for to steal and to kill and
[30:54] to destroy I am come that they might
[31:00] have life and that they might have it
[31:03] more abundantly I am The Good Shepherd
[31:07] the Good Shepherd giveth his life for
[31:11] the Sheep we'll turn to John chapter 16
[31:14] just a few chapters over John chapter 16
[31:22] and verse 24 and in that day verse 23
[31:33] and in that day you shall ask me nothing
[31:36] verily verily I say unto you whatsoever
[31:39] you shall ask the Father in my name he
[31:43] will give it to you hitherto
[31:46] have you asked nothing in my name
[31:50] amazing that after all the
[31:53] time of being with Jesus they hadn't
[31:55] recognized the authority and the power
[31:57] that was in his name that actually the
[32:01] scripture says Jesus said up until this
[32:04] point you haven't even asked anything in
[32:06] my name he says let's read it again
[32:09] hitherto you have asked nothing in my
[32:11] name ask ask and you shall receive that
[32:16] your joy may be full
[32:20] I won't full joy him head braise the
[32:24] Lord wood has turned to the book of
[32:25] Revelation chapter 12 one more and we'll
[32:26] have you be seated
[32:27] amen just want to want to catch this one
[32:30] scripture here Revelation chapter 12
[32:38] amen in verse 12 woe to the inhabiters
[32:46] of the earth and of the seal for the
[32:51] devil is come unto you having great
[32:54] wrath because he knoweth that he hath
[32:58] but a short time the devil knows that do
[33:02] we know it but there's only just a small
[33:05] little space of time left that's why the
[33:09] devil fights harder than ever before
[33:11] remember he's not omniscient he can't he
[33:14] doesn't know all things like God knows
[33:16] all he knows is what he can see
[33:19] literally physically I'm speaking
[33:21] literally here he's not like God he
[33:23] can't read the mind the only way the
[33:26] devil knows where time is in history is
[33:28] by watching and seeing he sees it when
[33:31] he sees the depravity the immorality he
[33:35] sees it when he sees homosexuality on
[33:38] the rise
[33:38] he knows the Bible and he believes the
[33:41] Bible he's a believer the Bible says you
[33:44] believe in God so does the devil he
[33:46] fears and he trembles he knows the
[33:49] scripture says that in the coming of the
[33:51] Son of man that it shall be just like it
[33:54] was in the days of sodom and gomorrah
[33:56] the devil sees the days of sodom coming
[33:59] and he knows must be short something's
[34:02] about to take place
[34:03] amen praise the Lord let's pray Heavenly
[34:05] Father we
[34:06] thank you Lord for the reading of your
[34:08] word this morning we just asked Oh God
[34:10] would you come and make your word real
[34:12] to your people father I believe Lord
[34:15] that you're here because you've been
[34:17] invited and you come where you're
[34:18] invited Lord Father now may you just
[34:21] feel comfortable amongst us Lord may you
[34:23] take this simple little thought that
[34:25] you've given me Lord you've burden my
[34:27] heart with a heavy burden Lord something
[34:30] father maybe today's service Lord would
[34:33] be something that would be real
[34:34] personable personal to me Lord because
[34:37] you dealt with me on such a personal
[34:39] level Lord when you gave me this
[34:41] inspiration father but I want that too
[34:44] Lord not just bless me but allow me to
[34:47] communicate that burden to these people
[34:49] so that they can be blessed and edified
[34:51] also we ask Lord that you would come and
[34:54] have your way take control of this
[34:56] service in Jesus Christ's name amen you
[35:00] can be seated I'd like to speak to you
[35:09] on taking back your god-given property
[35:14] brother Branham says here in the
[35:16] resurrection of Lazarus and you have
[35:18] this you could put it up and man becomes
[35:21] a son of God not Hillman himself but the
[35:25] Holy Spirit that's in him is God the
[35:28] Creator lives in the creation oh my how
[35:32] I think of that then stand with an
[35:35] unwavering faith and ask what you will
[35:38] it'll be done unto you there he is there
[35:43] he is he says in the message what was
[35:45] the Holy Ghost given for the same Holy
[35:48] Spirit that saved the Lutheran's that
[35:51] sanctified the Methodists that baptized
[35:53] the Pentecostals is now setting in order
[35:57] the coming of the Lord Jesus when it
[36:01] will be so powerful that body will come
[36:04] into this group of church that'll draw
[36:07] the rest of them from the grave there
[36:11] will be a resurrection that's what the
[36:14] Holy Ghost is for
[36:16] that's what the Holy Ghost is for when
[36:20] it will be so powerful brother Branham
[36:23] says this Holy Spirit will come under
[36:26] such power and such authority in that
[36:29] church that's me brother that's you then
[36:33] I literally draw the rest of them from
[36:36] the grave Oh God's waiting on me and you
[36:42] the church is waiting on me and you
[36:46] adoption time when God can pour into us
[36:50] his fullness his power his resurrection
[36:53] that when the church and Christ become
[36:57] so close together till Christ becomes
[37:00] visible among us and raises the dead and
[37:04] we go in the rapture he says oh don't
[37:08] worry God is waiting and trying and
[37:11] pressing to get at the mystery of God
[37:15] revealed to his church that's what's
[37:18] holding back the coming of Christ now
[37:20] and the great millennium is this great
[37:23] supernatural power that really lays
[37:26] dormant in the church you know there's
[37:29] been power and authority that was given
[37:32] to Jesus there was power and authority
[37:34] that was given to the Son of God and the
[37:38] Bible says that all that was in God he
[37:40] poured into Christ and all that was in
[37:44] Christ he poured into his church so we
[37:47] know that we've been given supernatural
[37:49] power and authority over the devil but
[37:52] the Prophet says the problem is is that
[37:55] it lays dormant within the church he
[37:58] says also it is a fact that the Prophet
[38:00] for the last age must bring forth a
[38:03] message from God that will forerun the
[38:06] second coming of the Lord for by his
[38:09] message will the hearts of the children
[38:11] be turned back to the Pentecostal
[38:14] fathers notice this and with the
[38:17] restoration of the word will come the
[38:21] restoration of power
[38:25] with the restoration of the word will
[38:28] come the restoration of power I think
[38:32] what it meant when the scripture says
[38:35] here just speaking of Jesus in Matthew
[38:37] chapter 7 verse 28 and 29 and brothers
[38:41] you can just follow me as I quote these
[38:43] the Bible says it came to pass when
[38:45] Jesus ended these sayings the people
[38:49] were astonished at his doctrine for he
[38:52] taught them as one having Authority and
[38:56] not as the scribes the scripture says he
[39:00] taught them as one having authority this
[39:04] word Authority means with mastery with
[39:08] power with liberty as one who is in
[39:13] control now these people had heard from
[39:17] the scribes their entire life they had
[39:19] heard Pharisees teach and Sadducees
[39:22] teach and they were not illiterate men
[39:25] but they were educated eloquent in their
[39:27] speech have you ever heard someone and
[39:30] it's fascinating just to listen to
[39:32] someone a professor of any kind of
[39:34] subject when a person knows the subject
[39:37] that they study and they know the
[39:39] material you even say here a theologian
[39:42] break down certain Greek words and words
[39:45] in the Bible it can become fascinating
[39:48] just to listen and to hear the sheer
[39:50] brilliance of how well they know the
[39:53] subject if you hear a scientist start to
[39:55] break down something on the scientific
[39:58] level something you know me or you you
[40:00] could sit and listen and it just sounds
[40:02] like they're speaking another language
[40:03] but yet we can become so impressed just
[40:06] by the intelligence of that person
[40:09] because they know the subject very well
[40:12] they don't struggle when they speak they
[40:15] speak it and it just flows and the Bible
[40:18] says this is how the people heard the
[40:20] teachers the Pharisees as they took from
[40:22] the law of Moses and they were so
[40:24] skilled and and and I heard it said in
[40:27] one way that they could take a scroll
[40:29] that was written in the law the law was
[40:32] written in that scroll and they could
[40:34] take a pin and stick it through the the
[40:35] road up
[40:36] roll and tell you every letter that the
[40:39] the pin hit because they knew the scroll
[40:42] so well and the people had listened for
[40:45] so long to these Pharisees and to these
[40:48] scribes as they were intelligent but let
[40:50] me tell you before Jesus came on the
[40:53] scene there were still lepers there were
[40:55] still diseases there were people who
[40:57] could not speak there were mothers who
[41:00] had lost children
[41:01] there was adulterers and adultery there
[41:04] was fornication
[41:05] there was sickness there was blind
[41:07] people and I ask you where did they go
[41:12] for healing where did they go for
[41:17] deliverance when a mother had a child
[41:20] who was bound by a demon spirit when
[41:23] these demons didn't to show up suddenly
[41:26] when Jesus came on the scene but Satan
[41:29] had been afflicting God's people he had
[41:31] them in bondage and in under slavery he
[41:34] had been afflicting them with disease he
[41:37] had been afflicting them with sickness
[41:39] and with with bondage of sin there there
[41:42] in those days where I asked you could
[41:45] the family go who was struggling with
[41:47] marriage and a marriage may be on the
[41:50] brink of divorce and you know Moses say
[41:52] these were people these were children of
[41:54] God where could they turn to when their
[41:57] child was so full of a disease that he
[42:00] literally convulsed and shook in his
[42:02] body and they didn't know what to do
[42:04] with him where did they take their
[42:07] children and their and their family when
[42:09] they were addicted to drugs and addicted
[42:12] to alcohol and addicted to things of the
[42:14] world where could they take the church
[42:17] because where could they take their
[42:19] family all they could take him to was to
[42:21] a Pharisee who could recite the Word of
[42:24] God who could teach the Word of God and
[42:27] they could they could bring it under
[42:28] such a teaching but at the end of the
[42:30] day it didn't bring deliverance to the
[42:33] child it didn't bring deliverance to the
[42:35] marriage who was struggling these people
[42:37] needed a person who didn't just have an
[42:40] intelligence of the law but they needed
[42:43] to hear someone who had authority when
[42:46] he spoke
[42:46] who had power when his words came across
[42:49] his mouth and the scripture says when
[42:52] they heard them they were astonished
[42:54] because he didn't just speak
[42:56] authoritative Lee you know there's a
[43:01] very big difference in speaking
[43:03] authoritative Lee and speaking with
[43:05] authority
[43:06] a man can scream and raise his voice and
[43:11] he can act like he has authority he
[43:14] could yell and have a boisterous tone to
[43:17] his voice and even a person can become
[43:19] in fear and you could become you know
[43:21] shook up a little bit by that when a
[43:23] person yells but there's a difference
[43:26] when a person speaks authoritative Lee
[43:29] and when a person speaks with authority
[43:31] and the Bible says that he spoke he
[43:37] taught them as one having authority this
[43:42] was a person who knew who he was he knew
[43:45] who he came from he knew that upon his
[43:48] words all of heaven listen he knew that
[43:51] heaven backed up his words and when his
[43:55] words and the voice and the oxygen that
[43:57] God gave him in his body started coming
[44:00] up from his lungs and touched his vocal
[44:02] cords all heaven listened to the words
[44:05] of Jesus Christ and I ask you where
[44:09] could they take their families when they
[44:11] were addicted where could they take
[44:13] their children when they were addicted
[44:15] where could they take their families
[44:17] when they were broken where could they
[44:20] turn where could they go and today I
[44:23] asked the same question where can we
[44:26] come to when our families are in trouble
[44:28] when our children are addicted when our
[44:31] families are struggling when we have
[44:33] problems and real issues all my brother
[44:36] and my sister we don't need a theology
[44:38] lesson we don't need some kind of
[44:41] intelligence or a person who could speak
[44:43] eloquently or a person who could speak
[44:45] intelligently the churches of the world
[44:48] today are
[44:49] filled with men who could speak more
[44:52] eloquent than me or any other brother
[44:54] here today they're filled with people
[44:56] who sent years in sat in a school and
[44:59] listened to theology and doctrines of
[45:02] divinity and they told them in the Greek
[45:05] and they taught them in the Hebrew and
[45:07] they studied the Word of God and they
[45:09] come out of that school and they're
[45:11] putting on a pastorship of a church and
[45:13] they start a church on the man's ability
[45:16] or the man's intelligence and they build
[45:21] programs why because that's all that
[45:24] they have to hold the people they build
[45:27] programs and they build prayer they
[45:29] build dramas and they they put a school
[45:31] in the church nothing wrong with that
[45:32] and they put in you you notice every
[45:35] year these great churches get bigger and
[45:37] bigger and their budgets and their
[45:39] programs get bigger and bigger and they
[45:42] become more intelligent and it's filled
[45:44] today it's filled with churches of
[45:46] programs and skits and funny jokes and
[45:50] their sermons are filled with one-line
[45:52] jokes and one-line things trying to to
[45:55] have some kind of substance to give to
[45:57] the people they put a coffee shop in
[46:02] their vegetable for people to be able to
[46:05] have a Starbucks coffee and a doughnut
[46:07] while they sit in church why because
[46:09] that's all they have but I asked you my
[46:12] brother where can the hurting go where
[46:14] can the hungry go where can the bound go
[46:17] coffee can't set you free donuts cannot
[46:21] fix your marriage programs cannot give
[46:25] you power
[46:25] but what we need today is not a donut or
[46:28] a coffee we need people with authority
[46:32] and power to break the grip and the
[46:35] chains of the enemy
[46:37] [Applause]
[46:42] we need power and authority because
[46:46] we're facing a real devil we have real
[46:49] problems we have families with real
[46:51] issues and I say today we don't need a
[46:54] musket we don't need a funny joke we
[46:56] need the power of a mighty God in a real
[47:00] way to come and break the grip of the
[47:03] enemy off of her life and when Jesus
[47:07] came he brought power and he brought
[47:10] authority he spoke and that's why they
[47:12] asked him by what authority do you do
[47:15] these things and who gave thee this
[47:19] authority they asked him in whose name
[47:22] did you cast out these Devils and whose
[47:28] name did you do these things and what
[47:31] power or what authority did you cast out
[47:34] this devil they wanted to know where did
[47:38] you get your power where did you get
[47:40] your authority where did you get the
[47:43] with the way that you squared is it
[47:44] coming from where is this power coming
[47:46] from Oh what the church didn't know and
[47:49] what the world didn't know is that God
[47:51] was restoring Kingdom Authority and
[47:54] Kingdom power back to the people of God
[47:57] and he spoke as a king speaks he spoke
[48:05] in parables and he always referred to
[48:07] Kingdom the kingdom of heaven is like
[48:11] the kingdom of heaven now today we don't
[48:14] even know what Kingdom means and we read
[48:18] that word and we recite that scripture
[48:19] the kingdom of heaven behold the kingdom
[48:21] of God the kingdom of heaven but where
[48:23] do we really know what it really means
[48:25] back in those days there were real kings
[48:27] and there were real kingdoms the age
[48:30] that I grew up abhorrent born and I've
[48:32] never since there every every day I've
[48:35] been here on earth I've never been to a
[48:37] real there is a couple kingdoms a couple
[48:40] real kings but really there's really no
[48:42] such thing even the United Kingdom they
[48:44] call it the United Kingdom but it's not
[48:46] you
[48:47] and it's not a kingdom they have a king
[48:52] and they have a queen but you know what
[48:54] that queen has nothing to do with their
[48:56] everyday life they she's nothing more
[48:59] than a symbol and I am Britain has not
[49:03] had a King since you know with the last
[49:05] king they had the man who wrote this
[49:07] Bible King James was the last king who
[49:10] actually ruled because there's something
[49:12] different in a sovereign in one who
[49:16] rules and one who's a king or a queen
[49:19] you see you can actually have a person
[49:24] as a queen and call herself a sovereign
[49:27] or a king or a queen but there's a very
[49:30] real difference when that person rules
[49:33] their kingdom and Jesus came to rule his
[49:39] kingdom brother Branham says this he
[49:42] says I'm afraid that the church doesn't
[49:44] know their authority
[49:46] I'm afraid that Holy Ghost born men
[49:49] don't realize their Authority or the
[49:52] authority that God has permitted to his
[49:55] church
[49:56] I'll give unto thee the keys of the
[49:58] kingdom brother Branham says so exercise
[50:01] your faith let it loose let God have his
[50:09] way
[50:10] o God the Great Spirit in the beginning
[50:12] before there was a beginning he was God
[50:13] and did you know you were in him then if
[50:17] you're a Christian now you were in him
[50:20] then and if that be so the whole Godhead
[50:23] bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus
[50:25] Christ and then when Jesus died at the
[50:28] cross I died with him for I was in him
[50:32] he was the fullness of the word
[50:35] manifested knowing that we would be
[50:38] manifested later and we were at Calvary
[50:41] with him he went in the grave and we
[50:44] went in the grave with him we raised
[50:46] with him in his resurrection and now
[50:49] we've ascended by his spirit into the
[50:53] throne of grace setting together in
[50:56] heavenly places
[50:59] in Christ Jesus listen to this and when
[51:04] the entire Word of God incomplete
[51:07] was headed up in a human body called
[51:10] Jesus Christ in there God made me pay
[51:14] for my sins in him there then he raised
[51:21] up and then he raised me up with him in
[51:24] the resurrection and now we are seated
[51:29] together and now we're seated together
[51:33] with him with power and authority over
[51:37] every devil oh if you can only believe
[51:41] what God has given you Jesus spoke the
[51:46] word and it was so why the scripture
[51:49] said so the Bible says he gave him
[51:52] Authority and he gave him power and
[51:54] Jesus said in my name they shall cast
[51:58] out Devils they'll speak with new
[52:00] tongues they'll take up serpents and
[52:03] drink deadly things and it will harm
[52:05] them if they lay their hands on the sick
[52:09] they shall recover
[52:11] oh I cry speak Moses and go forward if
[52:17] you say to this mountain not if you pray
[52:20] to this mountain not if you pray to this
[52:26] mountain but if you say to this mountain
[52:31] because Authority comes by the voice
[52:35] authority comes by words Authority comes
[52:38] not by nodding not by thinking but by
[52:41] speaking God gave us a voice let the
[52:45] redeemed of the Lord the Bible says let
[52:49] the redeemed of the Lord say so why cry
[52:53] unto me speak if you say to this
[52:55] mountain not pray but if you say to this
[52:58] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[53:01] your heart but believe what you said
[53:03] will come to pass you can have what you
[53:06] said
[53:11] and brother Brennan says Satan knew that
[53:14] he had just a short-time that's what the
[53:16] scripture says in Revelations chapter 12
[53:18] he said that he knew that he had just a
[53:21] short time and he knew so what was he
[53:24] trying to do he was trying to attack the
[53:27] purpose and the seed of God that's what
[53:31] he that's why he infiltrated the human
[53:33] race in the Garden of Eden he was trying
[53:35] to destroy the seed of God and he
[53:40] thought he was successful he thought he
[53:43] had accomplished his purpose but God
[53:45] said what I'm going to do I'm gonna take
[53:48] a seed and I'm gonna put a seed down
[53:50] inside of the earth down inside of the
[53:53] ground I'm gonna bury the treasure I'm
[53:56] gonna hide the treasure from the devil
[53:59] in a realm called the soul because the
[54:01] devil can afflict the flesh he can give
[54:04] us the Jesus he could give us sicknesses
[54:06] he could give us bodily harm he could
[54:08] even destroy our own human body and he
[54:14] could also attach your spirit he could
[54:16] also attach your memory he could start
[54:19] to get you and attach you on your
[54:21] affection and your reasoning and your
[54:23] conscience and your memory but God said
[54:26] but I'm gonna put my elected seed not in
[54:29] the flesh not in the spirit I'm gonna
[54:32] hide it in the soul because the devil
[54:34] can't get to the soul hallelujah and God
[54:40] knew when you heard the word of God
[54:42] maybe you didn't even realize it but
[54:45] something not in your flesh not in your
[54:48] spirit but something down on the inside
[54:51] of you responded to the Word of God
[54:55] that's why brother Adam said if you are
[54:58] gods you always were gods and you never
[55:00] cannot be gods Jesus said I come from
[55:04] God I go back to God he knew where he
[55:07] came from and where he came from gave
[55:09] him authority and power do you know
[55:12] where you come from
[55:14] know that you were in the back part of
[55:16] God's mind as an attribute a spiritual
[55:19] gene of your father and you came to this
[55:23] world to be tested and tried and your
[55:26] character to be refined but when you
[55:29] heard the word of God you recognized
[55:31] that as Eagles food you heard you heard
[55:37] from your theophany hallelujah and Satan
[55:44] thought he had him but God seed his line
[55:47] would go on through all the way through
[55:49] Redemption and Satan would follow that
[55:52] line it's even said that the tree of
[55:54] knowledge of good and evil have seen a
[55:56] painting one time it was it was a
[55:57] picture of a literal tree of the tree of
[56:00] knowledge of good and evil and the tree
[56:02] of life and they were so close together
[56:04] that their branches actually intertwined
[56:06] and the prophet of God says this in the
[56:09] church age book he said the trees were
[56:11] so close
[56:12] they literally their branches
[56:14] intertwined one in another what was it
[56:17] Satan trying everything he can to
[56:20] destroy that seat of God and he thought
[56:26] he had him when he killed King and when
[56:29] he killed Abel he thought he had him
[56:30] when he destroyed Abel but then there
[56:32] came a Seth and he thought he had him
[56:34] one who destroyed Seth but then there
[56:36] came a Jacob he thought he had him when
[56:38] he killed when he destroyed Abraham when
[56:40] he destroyed Isaac but God seed and his
[56:43] purpose kept moving and kept flowing
[56:49] Jesus said here's my purpose I've come
[56:52] that they might have they be in my seed
[56:54] that they might have life and here's the
[57:00] devil's purpose to steal to kill and to
[57:03] destroy and that's what his purpose is
[57:10] and just as busy as God has been and his
[57:15] purpose Satan has been just as busy
[57:17] trying to destroy to steal and kill from
[57:22] the family of God he literally followed
[57:26] that seedless
[57:27] and he followed that line all the way
[57:30] till he came to Jesus Christ he knew
[57:35] something was different about this
[57:36] person the Bible says that the demons
[57:41] that the devils even knew when they seen
[57:44] him they said why have you come to
[57:46] torment us before our time they
[57:49] recognized the spiritual authority that
[57:52] Jesus had they recognized the spiritual
[57:58] authority they recognized though he
[58:00] didn't look like it he was a king
[58:04] [Music]
[58:07] now his kingdom was not on the earth he
[58:12] was a king from heaven and he laid aside
[58:15] his crown he laid aside his royal robes
[58:19] and he built a body he created a sperm
[58:24] and an egg and the blood cell and he
[58:26] came forth as a human being he was the
[58:31] man god he was the man God the god man
[58:42] brother Branham says it this way he was
[58:44] 100% God and he was 100% man don't let
[58:52] anybody ever tell you that he wasn't a
[58:54] man he was in every way tempted and
[58:57] tried and tested in every category that
[59:01] you as a human being in order to be a
[59:04] kinsman redeemer he took on flesh just
[59:08] like your flesh he got tired
[59:13] he got weary he felt pain oh when they
[59:20] nailed him to a cross and they nailed
[59:22] that stake in his hand he felt the pain
[59:25] as a man he felt the agony as a man he
[59:29] became so tired that God had to send
[59:32] angels to minister unto his spirit
[59:40] st. new something something different
[59:42] say it eventually recognized who he was
[59:45] tried to tempt him in the wilderness
[59:47] took him to a high mountain tried to get
[59:50] him to cast himself down said surely God
[59:53] the Angels will bear you up Jesus said
[59:57] get behind me Satan tried to get him to
[1:00:00] come to his position showed him all the
[1:00:02] kingdoms of the earth brother Branham
[1:00:04] says but Jesus knew one day he's going
[1:00:07] to inherit those kingdoms anyway and he
[1:00:10] defeated the devil in the wilderness and
[1:00:13] he comes out of the wilderness with
[1:00:14] power and with authority he's baptized
[1:00:18] in the Jordan River and Satan thought
[1:00:21] when they arrested him so what is his
[1:00:23] plan start to do he tries to destroy
[1:00:25] that seed of God he tried to destroy him
[1:00:28] he arrested him and then and the Bible
[1:00:31] says that they crowned him with the
[1:00:33] crown of thorns they spit in his face
[1:00:35] they mocked him they slapped him in the
[1:00:38] face and the Bible says they hung him
[1:00:44] upon a cross and nailed him to a tree no
[1:00:51] doubt Satan thought he had him because
[1:00:53] Satan knew the plan of God now remember
[1:00:56] Satan is not omniscient he's not
[1:00:58] all-knowing he doesn't know all things
[1:01:01] he believes the word and Satan listened
[1:01:04] and listens to the voices of prophets
[1:01:07] because he knows that the word comes to
[1:01:11] the Prophet and no doubt Satan was
[1:01:17] reading the words of Isaiah no doubt he
[1:01:19] was reading when Jesus stood in the
[1:01:21] temple and said this day this scripture
[1:01:24] is fulfilled no doubt Satan said that's
[1:01:30] exactly what Isaiah said that's exactly
[1:01:33] what the Prophet said no doubt when
[1:01:36] Jesus moved and eneded signs and wonders
[1:01:39] and miracles and he had authority and he
[1:01:41] had powers of Satan knowing my time is
[1:01:44] short the scripture says he's upset
[1:01:47] and he has fury and he has anger because
[1:01:49] he knows he has just a short space of
[1:01:53] time to interrupt the program of God and
[1:02:00] you know what he knew he knew that God
[1:02:02] as the Prophet said judged him as a
[1:02:07] sinner and Satan knew that if he died a
[1:02:12] sinner he'd go to hell no doubt he had
[1:02:19] been scheming and he had been planning
[1:02:21] had this entire thing all worked up it's
[1:02:24] gonna use the very word of God against
[1:02:26] God himself and the Bible says that the
[1:02:32] earth turned the sky turned black and
[1:02:35] the Sun hid its face what is it it looks
[1:02:39] like victory for the devil
[1:02:42] it looks like victory for the kingdom of
[1:02:44] darkness it looked like victory for the
[1:02:47] devil himself and Jesus died and they
[1:02:51] took his body and they put him in a tomb
[1:02:53] oh I could just hear hell starting to
[1:02:57] shout I could hear the party start
[1:02:59] getting second hear the the party
[1:03:01] starting down and the under realms of
[1:03:03] the lost and Satan and his demons and
[1:03:06] remember he doesn't know everything for
[1:03:08] all he know what a dumb devil what a
[1:03:12] dumb devil he thought he could kill him
[1:03:16] as a sinner and God would send him to
[1:03:18] hell and that's exactly what he did
[1:03:22] brother Brennan says here he goes oh the
[1:03:25] Bible says the same the Dia's sin
[1:03:27] descended a sin it is the same one who
[1:03:30] descended and preached to the souls that
[1:03:32] were in prison that prepended not in the
[1:03:35] long-suffering of the days of Noah and
[1:03:38] so Jesus the sins is theophany goes down
[1:03:42] into hell you think he was just laying
[1:03:44] in that tomb and his body is just laying
[1:03:47] there but what the devil didn't know and
[1:03:50] what the disciples didn't even know it's
[1:03:52] the mighty
[1:03:53] banker was busy at work conquering his
[1:03:56] kingdom they thought he was just laying
[1:04:00] there doing nothing but he was busy at
[1:04:02] work and he goes down into the realm of
[1:04:06] mortals you know just below the region
[1:04:09] of mortals the region of mortal beans
[1:04:12] lays the realm of demon power just below
[1:04:15] this realm of mortals just below us in
[1:04:19] another dimension prophet of God said
[1:04:22] that that just above us is that is the
[1:04:24] dimension of angels and powers and
[1:04:26] supernatural just in another dimension
[1:04:28] and the go up just a little bit beyond
[1:04:32] that is paradise where Abraham and Isaac
[1:04:34] and Ezekiel was and then just above that
[1:04:39] dimension is heaven itself where the son
[1:04:41] of God where God Himself is but take
[1:04:46] that the reverse the other way prophet
[1:04:48] of God said just below this room of
[1:04:50] mortals lays the realm of demon power
[1:04:53] and below that above that lays the souls
[1:04:56] of the unjust and below the souls of the
[1:05:00] unjust lays the very domain of Satan
[1:05:04] himself hell Hades gianna they caught
[1:05:09] him many different things in the Bible
[1:05:11] they called it Guiana because outside of
[1:05:13] Jerusalem gana was the the ditch where
[1:05:16] they put all the trash and they burn it
[1:05:17] and they called it on fire and it burned
[1:05:20] with fire for days Hell where Satan was
[1:05:26] just below just above us lays the holy
[1:05:30] spirit then under the altar lays the
[1:05:32] souls of just men and the next is God
[1:05:35] himself one going downward one going
[1:05:38] upward and you're caught right in the
[1:05:40] middle of those two rims and the prophet
[1:05:44] of God says your entire life the rim
[1:05:47] from below is trying to influence you
[1:05:49] and the rim from above is trying to
[1:05:52] influence you
[1:05:54] there's where your battle is and Jesus
[1:05:58] dies and he goes down there oh I could
[1:06:01] see him on Friday afternoon after his
[1:06:03] death only comes to the door and the
[1:06:06] regions of the loss and he knocks on the
[1:06:09] door brother Branham says in there was
[1:06:15] women and children and men those unjust
[1:06:19] ones who didn't repent into long
[1:06:20] suffering days he was going to preach
[1:06:23] two souls that were in prison
[1:06:27] young ladies down there men down there
[1:06:30] women down there there was old there was
[1:06:33] young they were all together in this
[1:06:35] hideous place the Prophet says I seen
[1:06:37] that hideous place one time in a
[1:06:39] hospital bed I seen it I seen hell and I
[1:06:43] was falling and falling and falling and
[1:06:45] falling seemed like I would never stop
[1:06:47] falling what is it brother an sees hell
[1:06:53] the prison of the lost souls
[1:06:56] oh and that mournful place in that
[1:06:59] hideous place Jesus walked to the door
[1:07:02] and everything had to witness that he
[1:07:04] was the son of God they had been
[1:07:06] preached you in the long suffering days
[1:07:08] of Noah and Jesus said you remember when
[1:07:11] you were young and you were in the days
[1:07:13] of Noah you remember when Noah was
[1:07:15] preaching Noah was preaching about me I
[1:07:19] am the one who Noah was preaching about
[1:07:23] and I'm the one who was anointing and
[1:07:25] inspiring Noah to preach Jesus says I'm
[1:07:34] the one who anak spoke of I'm the one
[1:07:40] who Enoch spoke of I'm the seed of the
[1:07:45] woman
[1:07:49] Satan has no idea what's taking place
[1:07:52] he's in Hell celebratin partying music's
[1:07:57] loud everybody's dancing for all he
[1:07:59] knows he's got victory little does he
[1:08:02] know Jesus is just one rim above him
[1:08:04] preaching a sermon and Jesus said I was
[1:08:09] the seat I'm the one who Enoch spoke of
[1:08:11] I'm the seed of the woman that was to
[1:08:14] bruise the serpent every word of God has
[1:08:18] been fulfilled I died just a little bit
[1:08:21] ago yonder on Calvary my blood is still
[1:08:25] wet on the cross and at Calvary I
[1:08:28] purchased my church and then brother
[1:08:36] Branham says he goes on down just a
[1:08:39] little bit further he goes down into the
[1:08:42] regions of demons own to the very gates
[1:08:45] of Hell and he knocks at the door I
[1:08:53] imagine as the partying was going and
[1:08:56] the music was loud suddenly someone says
[1:08:59] hey do you hear that
[1:09:00] he has sounds like someone's knocking
[1:09:02] and suddenly they said turn the music
[1:09:04] down and they hear enough Satan says oh
[1:09:10] man I thought everybody was here who's
[1:09:14] missing
[1:09:19] brother Bannon says he knocks at the
[1:09:21] door Oh his body was laying in the tomb
[1:09:25] little did they know the mighty
[1:09:27] Conqueror was visiting the just and the
[1:09:30] unjust he was visiting the very gates of
[1:09:33] Hell he was visiting the very torment
[1:09:35] and Hades the very place and the seed
[1:09:38] and the throne of the devil brother Adam
[1:09:41] says when he does the devil comes to the
[1:09:43] door and I can just hear him say oh it's
[1:09:48] you
[1:09:49] you finally arrived God judged you as a
[1:09:53] sinner and now you've come to hell
[1:09:55] brother Adam says oh there it comes and
[1:09:58] Satan says oh you finally arrived I
[1:10:01] thought I had you when I killed Abel I
[1:10:05] thought I had you and brother venom says
[1:10:08] you see when the seed was promised in
[1:10:10] the Garden of Eden the devil is
[1:10:11] constantly tried to destroy that seed
[1:10:14] and the death of Abel coming of Seth was
[1:10:16] just death burial and resurrection and
[1:10:19] the seed must continue and he said I
[1:10:22] thought I had you when I destroyed Abel
[1:10:24] I thought I had you when I destroyed the
[1:10:26] prophets I was positive I had you when I
[1:10:29] beheaded John but now after all this
[1:10:32] time you finally arrived and I've got
[1:10:35] you now brother branham says I could
[1:10:38] just hear Jesus say come here Satan now

[1:12:31] them was it all over never prophet says
[1:12:34] never God has to keep his word I could
[1:12:37] see him take a little peep into paradise

[1:12:41] Abraham walking around up there and
[1:12:43] after a while they hear a knock brother
[1:12:50] Brandon says Oh looky here something on
[1:12:53] the door Abraham goes and opens the door
[1:12:57] said honey come here look here
[1:13:01] back that's the very same one that stood

[1:13:08] and made a promise to me that's the same
[1:13:12] one oh just that I can see Daniel look
[1:13:15] over and Daniel said that's the rock
[1:13:17] that was hewn out of the mountain just
[1:13:20] as certain as I'm standing here
[1:13:22] that's the
[1:13:22] same one I could see Joel Brides up and
[1:13:26] say that's my redeemer that said that I
[1:13:28] said I knew that he lived and someday
[1:13:31] I'd seen with my own eyes ZQ looks over

[1:13:45] middle of the will turning way up in the
[1:13:47] middle of the air here comes Enoch Enoch
[1:13:49] said I saw him coming with ten thousands
[1:13:52] of his Saints to execute judgment my
[1:13:57] brethren Jesus says I'm the one that you

[1:14:03] I'm the seed of the woman I'm the son of
[1:14:07] David I'm the son of God
[1:14:09] I was the rock in the wilderness I was
[1:14:12] the man of the fell from heaven
[1:14:13] I was the quail that you ate in the
[1:14:15] morning I was the brazen serpent that
[1:14:17] was lifted up to deliver you from

[1:14:47] the keys of death and how do you realize
[1:14:53] the authority and the power that you
[1:14:56] have the church has been living too long
[1:14:59] under the torment of a puff of a
[1:15:03] defeated enemy of a defeated coward who
[1:15:06] was defeated at Calvary and his power
[1:15:08] was stripped from him and power has been
[1:15:12] given to you as a son or daughter of God
[1:15:14] brother Branham says I don't care how
[1:15:17] weak you think you are and how
[1:15:20] so you think you are in the body of
[1:15:22] Christ even if you're the skin on the
[1:15:25] bottom of the feet you still have every
[1:15:28] devil in hell underneath you
[1:15:31] I say rise up today and recognize your
[1:15:35] position in Jesus take back what God
[1:15:41] Satan his stole from you
[1:15:44] you know Satan's a thief that's what he
[1:15:50] is he was defeated and lost his power
[1:15:56] but what he does is this he's a thief
[1:15:59] Jesus says he's a thief he steals kills
[1:16:03] and destroys you know the thief a thief
[1:16:08] takes other people's property something
[1:16:13] that doesn't belong to him a thief
[1:16:20] doesn't come in broad daylight he
[1:16:25] doesn't come in the middle of the day
[1:16:27] a thief comes he doesn't come in the
[1:16:31] broad they liked and announced that he's
[1:16:34] there but he comes when you're asleep
[1:16:36] and you're not watching and you're tired
[1:16:40] you know we had a thief break into our
[1:16:42] neighborhood in a neighborhood that
[1:16:43] we've moved from now lived in not in
[1:16:45] decent nice neighborhood nothing you
[1:16:47] know a no kind of major crime in it had
[1:16:50] my car broken into I think three times
[1:16:53] left I never locked my car because I
[1:16:55] don't ever leave anything in it that's
[1:16:57] valuable the only thing I got out to my
[1:17:01] car that morning and I I went to work
[1:17:03] and went in and got in my car and it was
[1:17:04] just a mess everything everywhere my
[1:17:07] DVDs my might my CDs all oh my oh my I
[1:17:11] had maybe thirty cents in pennies it was
[1:17:14] just stretched everywhere and I thought
[1:17:16] man Rachel got in here and she was
[1:17:17] looking for something messed my car up I
[1:17:19] called her waited for her to wake up I
[1:17:21] said honey what did you do to my car she
[1:17:26] said I was calling you to ask the same
[1:17:28] question what did you do to my car
[1:17:31] [Laughter]
[1:17:34] the thief had went in mine rummage
[1:17:36] through it went into hers rummage
[1:17:38] through and destroyed both of them
[1:17:39] suddenly it dawned on us there's been a
[1:17:43] thief he broke into I think they I think
[1:17:46] he broke into 47 Kars 47 or it was
[1:17:49] almost 50 broke into people's vehicle I
[1:17:53] talked to the investigator who was
[1:17:54] looking into it trying to find the thief
[1:17:56] he said you know this is a thief of
[1:17:58] opportunity I said what does that mean
[1:18:00] he said well he's not someone who wants
[1:18:03] to confront anyone he doesn't want a
[1:18:05] confrontation with you he's a thief of
[1:18:08] opportunity he says most likely he's
[1:18:10] walked through this neighborhood in the
[1:18:12] middle of the day you've probably seen
[1:18:13] him multiple times said really he said
[1:18:16] oh I'm sure of it I'm sure he said if
[1:18:18] someone has security video or footage of
[1:18:21] him we probably find him
[1:18:22] he said because this kind of thief goes
[1:18:24] in the middle of the day walks up and
[1:18:26] down the road waves to you says hello
[1:18:29] and he watches you he watches and
[1:18:31] patterns you he watches when do you
[1:18:33] leave when are you at home when are you
[1:18:35] at church in fact one of the families
[1:18:37] who was broken into it was while they
[1:18:39] were at church he came in and stole
[1:18:40] everything that they had stole their big
[1:18:44] 68 inch plasma TV I thought was gonna be
[1:18:47] disappointed if he comes into my house
[1:18:49] [Laughter]
[1:18:51] ain't nothing to take in the spot of the
[1:18:53] TV except the Hoffmans head of Christ
[1:18:55] you could have it you might need it he
[1:19:01] said he's a thief of opportunity comes
[1:19:03] in and he takes he watches and he waits
[1:19:05] he watches for you to let your guard
[1:19:07] down he tries to make you comfortable
[1:19:11] with him felt really he says yeah he's
[1:19:16] probably been in the car you know
[1:19:17] canvass in this neighborhood watching
[1:19:19] your schedule when do you go to work
[1:19:20] when is your wife go to the grocery
[1:19:21] store when he home when your kids go
[1:19:23] here go to school and he waits for his
[1:19:26] chance and his opportunity and he takes
[1:19:32] the thief comes when you're not focused
[1:19:39] when you're sleeping and you're tired
[1:19:43] and Satan robs people most when they
[1:19:47] become spiritually tired and unfocused
[1:19:54] this is exactly what Jesus was saying
[1:19:56] what the scripture says when it says be
[1:19:59] vigilant be sober because your adversary
[1:20:06] is like a lion going to and fro seeking
[1:20:17] whom he may devour so be sober be sober
[1:20:23] be clear be alerted be vigilant be on
[1:20:27] guard be spiritual don't get laughs
[1:20:30] don't get loose because the minute you
[1:20:32] get sleepy Satan comes and Rob's you
[1:20:37] blind Satan comes and Rob's you blind
[1:20:43] the Lord begin to just deal with me on a
[1:20:46] very personal level when he gave me this
[1:20:49] inspiration and begin to tell I begin to
[1:20:52] see this that the devil had robbed me
[1:20:55] and stolen things for me robbed me of my
[1:20:58] spiritual health robbed me of my
[1:21:01] spiritual appetite because that's what
[1:21:05] he is
[1:21:05] he's a robber he's a thief he wants to
[1:21:08] kill he wants to steal and he wants to
[1:21:11] destroy Satan hates marriage you know
[1:21:18] why he hates marriage because it's a
[1:21:20] covenant it's a bond and a real
[1:21:23] god-given bond brings unity and when you
[1:21:28] have marriages and families that are
[1:21:30] unified guess what you have a church
[1:21:33] that is unified and when you have
[1:21:38] families that are in discord and
[1:21:40] disunity

[1:21:52] he wants to destroy a thief
[1:21:58] doesn't come and announce that he's
[1:21:59] there but it comes when you're unfocused
[1:22:02] and once he stolen from you he doesn't
[1:22:06] call you in another state when you're
[1:22:09] out of town he doesn't call you and say

[1:22:34] is to leave quietly - not even to cover
[1:22:38] his tracks
[1:22:39] to show no sign of a disturbance and
[1:22:44] suddenly you look around one day and you
[1:22:46] go hey where'd that go I bought a very
[1:22:51] expensive for me it was very expensive
[1:22:53] probably close to $500 just one tool
[1:22:56] I'll need it for one job wasn't gonna
[1:22:58] use it much and because of that I put
[1:23:00] that tool in a spot didn't think anybody
[1:23:02] would ever take didn't need the tool
[1:23:04] again for a really long time one day
[1:23:06] would just happen to be thinking about

[1:23:28] and realized it was stolen and all that
[1:23:32] time I had no idea it was even missing
[1:23:39] until I needed it
[1:23:45] Samson didn't realize his strength was
[1:23:48] gone until he needed it he didn't know
[1:23:55] he had given something away and the
[1:23:58] Bible says and he knew not that the
[1:24:00] Spirit of the Lord had departed him he
[1:24:05] shook himself and said I'll go out as
[1:24:07] every other time and he knew not Satan
[1:24:10] had stolen something from him and Satan
[1:24:14] comes and he takes things and he Rob's
[1:24:15] things from our life and then one day we
[1:24:21] look around and we say hey hold on a
[1:24:24] minute where does that go you know Satan

[1:39:44] back your god-given property how many
[1:39:49] here could say today Satan I've looked
[1:39:51] around my garage I've looked around my
[1:39:55] house and I've seen that you've taken
[1:39:56] some things I didn't even realize we're
[1:39:59] missing I've looked around and realized
[1:40:01] you've been coming when maybe I was
[1:40:03] sleepy and tired and unfocused and I've
[1:40:06] looked Satan I've seen you've stolen a
[1:40:08] few things and you might have thought I
[1:40:11] was gonna be content just to let you
[1:40:12] have them you might have thought I was
[1:40:15] gonna be content just to go oh well I
[1:40:17] guess he's got him but something in me
[1:40:19] says Satan I'm coming to your territory
[1:40:22] I'm marching back into the enemy's camp
[1:40:24] and I'm here to claim what's mine I'm
[1:40:27] here to take what back what's mine
[1:40:30] take your hands your filthy hands off of
[1:40:33] God's property Oh Lord Jesus you see
[1:40:38] these hands that are up everywhere we're
[1:40:41] here to claim what's ours Lord he's a
[1:40:44] thief he's a robber he's a destroyer but
[1:40:47] you've come that we might have life and
[1:40:49] we might have it more abundantly
[1:40:53] give us that abundant life give it to
[1:40:57] your children give it to marriages that
[1:40:59] are suffering give it to teenagers that
[1:41:01] are struggling give it to men and women

[1:41:16] strength to the weak restore strength to
[1:41:23] the weary Lord Satan is a robber he's a
[1:41:27] thief and he's stolen many things from
[1:41:30] her life but today we're here to claim
[1:41:33] our possession and Jesus Christ today
[1:41:37] we're here to recognize as your prophet
[1:41:40] said Shamgar suddenly it dawned on him
[1:41:44] I'm a seed of Abraham I'm a son of
[1:41:48] Abraham and God made Abraham a promise
[1:41:52] your seed shall possess the gates of his
[1:41:58] enemy and we realized that today Lord
[1:42:03] that were seed of God we're not seed
[1:42:10] because we were reborn but your prophet
[1:42:13] says we were seed and therefore we are
[1:42:15] and we were reborn you've placed an
[1:42:20] eternal attribute down inside of us Lord
[1:42:22] you very you've placed Authority and
[1:42:25] power and every child of God every son
