the Song of Solomon tonight if you would chapter 6 verse 1 whether is thy beloved gone all thou fairest among women whether is thy beloved turned aside that we may seek him with thee my beloved has gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to feed in the gardens to gather villas I am My Beloved's and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lilies won't speak ticket tonight on my beloved is in his garden let's bow our heads together and we'd like to be remembered tonight before the lord god bless your hearts your request Lord Jesus we thank you tonight for your great great presence that

trials that you and your wisdom allow to come to pass in our lives knowing that it makes us better people when we come through it on the other side we're in need of you tonight Lord I pray the great author of this word would come and catch us into a place where we would move beyond this building may we move beyond our worries and our frustrations and doubts and troubles for just a little while may you be able to catch us as it was and help us go into that sphere of the divine realm of God speak to us those things which we have need of tonight father we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus amen god bless you may be seated my beloved is gone down into his gaen enclosure enclosed garden figurative of a bride or the Garden of Eden let's start tonight if we can with a divine drama let us move beyond 27:33 Elizabethton highway let us move beyond the realm of time as we know it will move eastward into the land of Egypt where the Garden of Eden was we will move beyond sickness sorrow despair we are going to walk into a great place that we're not sure exactly how long it was in existence but we know every day that it was was absolutely perfect and sublime it was not just the trees it was not just the scenery it was not the plants it was not the botton in life that was so perfect but it was the two residents as well that had been able to partake of a divine nature a man the first man and woman that God had made he's standing there with his hair longer than mine tonight Shaggy hanging down about his net his wife was fair skinned blond hair and blue eyes they were absolutely perfect there was no sin there was no fear there was no unbelief they were able to be in this place because of a miraculous deposit that God had placed in them both when they were made brother Bream tells us in oneness with God the first man and first woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and taught lip to ear was Adam and Eve now that is perfect oneness God in His creation God speaking lip to ear was Adam and Eve they were so perfect harmony with God till they were one with God God and his family one now in this we will see the great purpose of father supreme he's not just father he's father supreme notice in paragraph 16 that's God's purpose his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way they could be one with the family or God was because God's nature was in them so that made them with God's nature in them then with each other and God they all become all one isn't that a beautiful picture God and his family father overall supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches Lord no messing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have a heartache just one with God what a picture because the nature of God was in these people now this is going to be relevant to your restoration the nature of God was in these people therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God made them what is the only grounds of fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself in his church is the oneness of himself in the people this is why joining the church even coming to the message coming to Happy Valley or any other message Church does not make you one with God there's only one way you can be one with God and that is God's nature living in you that can only come by God himself departing or importing rather His divine nature by a new verse it transforms us those of us that were born outside of Eden's gates and by the new birth we are transformed and moved back inside were the cherubims and said of now keeping us away the cherubims drive us toward the gate notice is the only grounds he said by a union to be united with him forever just like when you unite with your husband the woman to unite with her husband it is a violent to death now then if you unite was God it's the same thing that the church United was Christ until its death we part and then if you never sinned or do anything wrong you'll be eternally United with God and only deaths can take you away from God in our physical death but the sin of this sin is death and that takes you away from God so to be United here in the spirit and the power is eternal life you're eternally United with God oh I want to get to that extra bit United eternally with the eternal God perfect in harmony with him listen to this perfectly United together a church that almost God and His Church you knotted together do you believe that do you believe that is parts of this is already in this building right here tonight and the hearts of many of you sings now don't you see the great picture we are in first we are different and we're out like a by-product a creative being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are sons and daughters not some other spirit amen notice now not some other spirit but the Spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image in the of the Living God because we become sons and daughters not separated but the same spirit the same God the same person glory joined in wedlock to the eternal see how God planned it that we should be not I different but him not a different but him not some other being or of some other tribe but a real Union and offspring of the Almighty done by a holy Union and the church said now the body comes from mother and father but the Spirit comes from God God separating himself as Adam of separating notices joint and heavenly what look - the Cornel God part of him part of God join to the eternal God by heavenly wedlock so you can see it's not joining a church not shaking or preachers hand not even playing tapes not even attending a certain assembly only God can be able to do this great work now let us go back now and go into this great paradise again it is the initial stages of the first deposit of the family of God it is not the only members that he has but let's say it this way it would have been the first ones in the Lamb's Book of Life that he chose to deposit in the realm of humanity this is God's first sign that he wanted to live could have been Jim and Linda could have been me and Carol could have been you and your life could have been you and your life but God chose for it to be Adam and Eve but needless to say all the rest of those sons and their sweet hearts will be manifested in their time but for whatever reason God chose to exhibit in the first display and the Garden of Eden this first son Adam and his wife or his sweetheart II then this great power dice of God were not sure how long that they were able to live there because the relevance apparently of that is not significant to us because Moses did not mention it but we could imagine in her mind that it would have went on and on and on it might have been hundreds of years it might have been thousands of years time really did not matter because they were joined together in this union by God but in the way that God had deposited this divine nature in them was a way which could be separated from them yet not removes their name from the Lamb's Book of Life now a little bit different than from the way you when I receive it today in that we are sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that nature sealed in us but however God allowed it to be placed in Adam and Eve he knew that it was on a basis which would be temporary and he knew that Adam would actually forfeit the right to be a partaker of this divine nature so whether it was by importation of a time that God allowed the man and the woman to protect of it but we believe according to what we've read tonight that they did have God's nature in them you'll agree with that now it was in there but it was not in them and a permanency but it was in them for an element of time that the greater attributes of God might be expressed now you're there in this beautiful beautiful paradise of God Adam knows enough about the program of God to know that there's some sort of wrong there he knows enough about what God has said that he's placed in the Garden of Eden to dress and to keep it and they be able to maintain his supervision and dominion over it God doesn't go into the details God doesn't tell him watch for the serpent watch for this watch for that but God gives him enough for him to be able to be aware that there's something around where he's gonna have to watch it now in this no harm could come to them all the great birds that were there all the animal life everything was saying nothing was carnivorous everything eating vegetation the earth standing upright the same temperature all the way around no tilting of the axis twenty-two and a half degrees same temperature everywhere everything was absolutely perfect and the paradise of God the great dinosaurs were coming through the paradise of God and the birds of paradise would land over on Adams shoulder and they would COO to him and Adam would speak to him and everything was absolutely wonderful but yet God knew this would only last for a time now god of course is not going to make the man fall from this beautiful estate but he places a man on a probationary period in the Garden of Eden remember the Angels which are not elect were placed on the same probation so was Lucifer placed on a probation period that he could make his choice but the legs are not placed on probation they're placed on predestination well glory now what's this brother RAM goes on he says there was no harm that could calm the tiger lay down leo the lion lay down nothing would harm them then along comes sin rather it spoiled that beautiful picture Eve would have never needed maxfactor to fix her cosmetic face no sir it was God the very blush of eternal life in her made her beautiful Allison two sisters listen one of us the very blush of eternal life don't you see what cosmetics try to do they try to replace the blush of eternal life that God placed and our sister sheets a nation now Eve was the perfect thought of a woman and there was something there that blush in her but it was not rude it was not something that was added but it was I said the blush or the newness or the use all glories to God of eternal life that was there so she never had to get up in the morning and block her eyes and paper cheeks and all that but as long as she was in harmony with the divine nature of God eternal life kept her looking young don't you realize that's what it's going to be when we get there that day it's going to be that blush of the eternal life that will enter back into every one of us you're not gonna need high rollers you're not gonna need to dye your hair not gonna need to put pink on your cheeks they'll be there naturally by channel life but when eternal life left their mortality come in and mortality took away the blush out of her cheeks but she wants that blush but she tries to replace it was cosmetics instead of the numerous oma notice now he says the very blush of eternal life in her made her beautiful praise God the right blush of eternal life in her made her beautiful she would never have to have manicures or anything like to do today sin is what brought you to that place so sin is what brought humanity to that place to whether they want to concede you sing don't want to lift her face and if their eyes lift their nose and if their net lift I want to be totally lifted I want a facelift I'm won the body lift my goodness you're magic if you could see past this foreign some people they look like a wrinkled raisin from here down then look like a drawn up raisin oh my goodness they're plastic surgery everything this visible the rest of looks like a big fat prune well I don't want a facelift I don't want a neck lift I don't want me I want me I will bloom of eternal use in my face again Eve was the most beautiful woman that was ever on the earth she was God's perfect salt of a woman and Adam was the most perfect man that lived and when he was made manifest in Christ proved it now when you get that statement figured out let me know what that means would you marry stood I see Adam gray big manly shoulders his big muscles his legs his shaggy hair hanging around his neck uh-huh I'm sorry y'all didn't know brother man said that shaggy I can see even remember brother bottom saw the dog Baker sent a quote a few minutes ago is over a Manilla preach and he sent a quote sister famous Benson Oh before I walked out and brother REM said I had something so strange to happen to me life's not a broken division and he said I've seen Adam walk out of the Garden of Eden and then I moved followed on in town and I saw Jesus walk out this is not imagination he saw this by vision oh ma I can see Eve beautiful long hair hanging down her back as a matter of fact he said it came down to her hips her eyes as the blue as the skies Sparkle lots of stars she didn't have to use maxfactor to make her pretty no no sir no sir sins what did that beloved brother she's made in God's image she was made after the image of man after God had created her beautiful never to die never to get old never to wrinkle the sparkle to never go out of her eyes she was to be beautiful forever neither one of Adams shoulders ever sag hour his hair turned gray any deterioration oh ma to him walking perfect with friendship and fellowship with the father where is your beloved he was in his gardener so the eternal one coming down fellowshipping was two of these kids that had access to eternal life the blush of youth let's just say for the story tonight they lived to be three four or five thousand years old however long it was or however long this in the Garden of Eden rather that they just kept on going and going and going in time we don't know exactly but they never aged one bit never got up for the creek in the back or a creek in the net or a toe ache or leg ache or growing pains or nor the kind of pains as far as that goes and that blush of eternal youth was always there that he said sand it in and God seen they had seen but before he could even pass judgment he had to go kill an innocent lamb or a beast and told the skins back there to cover up to make a substitutionary death provided for the worshiper to come to him and Adam and Eve standing in his presence oh god I can see the leave of them beautiful eyes now after sin had set in tears filled them and they run down her cheek I can see Adam of those strong eyes even as he looked across the evening and the soft winds have long her you had to make the beasts to obey Him and the lands and the way sure babe everything else I don't make me a full rulership over everything on there he realized it lost his fellowship with God tears are listen to his tears to show him that he was mortal now dripped off at his face ran down over his bosom and dripped off on Eve's head I can see her look up and said Adam I'm the cause of it dear I'm the cause first time he feels the shock of mortality it ties to his spirit it affects his flesh ties to his spirit because the image had left his soul so the oneness was God was broken the oneness was his wife was broken so now the tears the first time begin to come into his eyes and they drop down out of his eyes move down his cheeks and the panting she was a little bit shorter than him so her head was leaned over on his shoulder on his bosom let me like hear as they begin to fall off and drop onto her blonde hair which soon will be speckled with gray and her tears begin to drop off as well and she kind of looked up at him and said Adam I'm the cause of it dear y'all know I see Adam and Eve the first little sweethearts and the Garden of Eden I'll see Adam back down when he put his arms around this little sweetheart to walk out with her for God had condemned him and he started out with his arms around his darling Adam was not deceived he didn't have to walk out but he walked out because he loved his wife he walked out with both eyes wide open no matter listen to us if she had to go to torment he go wizard Marcus what love when God looked down and sing that love of a human being it was so great that he couldn't stand it it overwhelmed God when he seen a man would love his wife so much it overwhelmed God glory to God hallelujah it was so great that he couldn't stand it himself that's right he said oh come and go - you realize God lets the garden eat him well he didn't want to live in Paradise alone Adam if you can't be here at a paradise if you and Eve can't be you see your smile if I can't hear your life if I can hear you talk about a little baby paradise paradise without you so he said I'll come and go - and he said I'll put enmity between her seed and the serpent see notice he goes on to say I'm at San Dimas condemnable driven from the Garden of Eden by God see all of these three words the redemptive robe the redemptive robe over him showed that and the redemptive robust wot sheepskin Laura - God the redemptive robe on Adam showed he had fallen sojourner Sandlin we stand before him that day and the redemptive road is gone robe is taken from us it will show we have been fully been redeemed we will need no more blood that we'll need no mercy seat you will need no attorney in your place you'll need no intercessor why you've changed the redemptive Road for a goal of thought bodies but while we are here we need to be clothed in a redemptive robe aren't you glad for tonight well what I said that Adam's sin willfully C Eve was actually deceived but Adam was not deceived he deliberately sent deliberately sinned knowing what he was doing because of his wife he took position with his wife than they went before God the both of them was condemned notice how jumps from the Garden of Eden now to the Garden of Gethsemane and also to the garden where he died Jesus not ignorant of what he was doing came down and took his place with the center the church that he might redeem the church back to himself don't you see what this sets such a thing in god hates you see brother John why it's such such a thing with God that God was overwhelmed by this come from God himself God himself in order to make reconciliation must do exactly the same thing add another Garden of Eden chose to become a sailor rather than to remain a god Jesus Christ and the Garden of Gethsemane chose to become a sinner rather than to remain God ship so he forfeited his God ship forsaking all Phoenix 1962 that's what the Prophet said oh ma I love the way God used brother Branham in these ways I can see all that space which was God God had no beginning of days ending of years he's forever and ever I can see all that great space as it begins to move together like this coming down notice what shape it takes not a box not a triangle not a dumptruck funnel so if you've got a two gallon gallon of gas or kerosene or something and you're trying to pour it in a small tiny hole what you do you might need a funnel hey man what's he gonna do it's gonna funnel it down to bring it into the mouth that you desire to be here's all this great space here's all this great love here's all this great goodness of God and God Condon's sins I'm on an upside-down ramier God in the form of a funnel comes down to minister what the redemptive rope God coming down to a funnel shape like that and it moved down and he began to ah that little couple gone through the Garden of Eden bloody skins flop and against her leg he couldn't stand it that's my father he couldn't stand it and it moved on all it moved down to the very heart of God and spelled l.o.v.e God so loved he just couldn't listen this he just couldn't see them go he called him back sure he'd push the redemptive robe on he said now get out and don't come back what does they start out hitting their legs on both sides Buffett said what is that slapping I hear step bloody sheepskin hitting their legs as they go out and father looked at him mother Jim and so he comes down in front of him goes over and fallen on the form of this this pillar of fire this light this funnel and he comes right down and Fannie said stop I'll make you this promise I will bring you back where is your beloved goat he's in his garden doing only what he could do the act of the kinsman redeemer he couldn't see them go he called them back and said I'm gonna put enmity isn't it amazing that God didn't tell this to Adam then this amazing that God didn't say to the man now you're the man you're the head of the house and you're this and that and the other we believe all that do mean heart but God never said it to the man but unto the woman he said praise be to God so the church is gonna play part of redemption now his position is going to bring not only eating back but it's going to bring his elect eating back as well a man now I'm of course forfeiting his rights to eternal life the kinsman redeemer must come down and condemn sin and he must be able to bring it back in order to restore the divine nature in the hearts of the elect of God notice his son Solomon chapter 4 verse 12 a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed I look at it will tell me here that God is going to bring the elight back into the state again the enclosed garden prophetically here he is speaking of his bride verse 16 she now recognizes her position awake o north wind come down south blow upon my garden that the spices there on my floor she is now moved into the stage of reconciliation she has now been identified by the divine nature of God she's answering back what was prophecy she can now say this day this scripture is fulfilled Song of Solomon chapter 5 verse 1 I'm coming into my garden my sister my spouse I have gathered my myrrh with my spice I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I have dropped my wine with my milk eat old friends yay drink abundantly Oh beloved what was it day of Pentecost haha they're all getting drunk come back in the garden again come on get drunk on my holy ghost it's so intoxicated by the power of God lets you forget what's your name here that you forget sir and let us say that you forget the things that around you come friends eat drink get intoxicated by the presence of God get ready to get your body change notice how's that 51 3 4 the Lord shall comfort sign remember the prophet said when you see sign in the Old Testament speaking of the bride the Lord shall comfort Zion he will comfort all her wife's places he will make her wilderness like what in and her desert like the Garden of the Lord joy and gladness shall be found therein Thanksgiving and the voice of melody sound like there's gonna be some Holy Ghost meetings going on there to me isaiah 58:11 the Lord shall godly continually and satisfy our soul and drought and make fat die bones you say 1 a whirling shell drying up like everybody else we've got a secret place we've got spiritual food a new season we've got water brother this Saint warmed up leftovers from 7500 years ago this is the mind of God for this hour [Applause] thou shalt be like a watered garden and ace like a spring of water whose waters fail not oh I wish we could go somewhere never revival brother don't you think we need to get Benny Hinn to come but breaker hobbled our church he ain't got no way to bring revival to our church he's sent to the hands not Eagles well praise God we need this radio God we need this television God we don't need none that we've got our own land we've got our own inheritance we got our own men of God let's say understanding of what it takes to feed this bride come on now Jeremiah 31 12 therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion and shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord for wheat and for wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any more at all praise God but how us these prophecies gonna come to pass the goal must go through another guard John 19 41 now in that place where he was crucified there was a and in the garden a new Sepulcher wherein was never man yet laid I wonder if they ever had a hard time keeping people in it after his and it wants the weirdest grave and the hold on the whole of the world every time they put people in they keep getting out they keep paying nobody man if he did you got your uncle dead you morning brought alive him bury him overboard Jesus was cuz nobody can stay in that grave now think of the place where he was crucified there was a garden glory be to God in the place he was crucified there was a garden and there was a garden tomb this is where the Songwriters and you hear the song of the garden tomb this is where they get it from this passage of scripture John being the only one who mentions this and this Jr touch honestly really sticks out to John and you think of it now that our kinsman redeemer he's going to be crucified or hallelujah crucified and he's going to come into a certain place and in there is going to be a garden what a peculiar place for a crucifixion but of course the Jewish rabbis say this is the same place Adam was buried but the place of the skull was more than just the place of the skull that they supposedly after his resurrection crucifixion found somebody's skull and the crack of the earth well I don't know about all that but I do know I was raised after he got up I may be legend and maybe this that the other I really don't know but I didn't know if we could ask John where is he at where's lettuce s Mary Mary where is he oh they killed him they crucified him I heard that but where is he he's in the garden where he should beloved so when Mary Magdalene goes down whenever she enters into that place that day where is she going in the garden glory be to God whenever she goes looking for her lord what's she gone by the Scott's she's going in the garden where he beloved he's in the garden let me tell you tonight my friends the fullness of his powers not in me but if you want to know where a portion of him is I'll tell you where he's at tonight he's in his garden I no longer can say well he was in brother Branham years ago he was in Paul he was in John if you want to know where he's at tonight at least a part of him I can tell you where is that he is in his garden praise be to God now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new Sepulcher his resurrection from this garden would secure the complete restoration of all that was lost and where does it happen in the garden so Adam enters into a spiritual tomb death and the day you eat thereof that day you will die no doubt it started that day something moved in him brother Terry he felt different he thought differently look differently at different Adam in turned into a garden tomb a tomb of his own making so here's the second Adam they don't crucify him over in some synagogues somewhere they don't crucify me on this place or that place but where did they pick to crucify in a garden and there is an empty tomb there that ain't just coincidence it's perfect setting for his resurrection and for yours it is a two-fold restoration in that he will bring Eden back and he will also raise his garden bride Lorie be to God notice she goes on to say in chapter 2 verse after 6 verse 2 my beloved has gone down the act of condescension now my beloved he is gone down into his garden over and over again she mentions this and of course it was in the natural sense the parallel of Solomon's that I mentioned to you that Josephus says that he had a garden which is about two miles in a place called FM e th a.m. about two miles from Jerusalem every morning Solomon would go down with great pomp and he would condense and and descend from Mount Zion which was the City of David he would come on that side of the city and they would come down with great pomp and go down into the garden and they would go down every day down in descend into the garden and then after his descending into the garden he would bring the fruits of the garden and he would have sinned in the captivity captive and banned gifts unto men so he would come up from the garden he will bring fruits and nuts and flowers and gifts and he would actually drop them along the way to the people as he's going back to Jerusalem when I Lord Jesus went down into hell and he knocked on the door took the keys away from the devil he emptied out paradise and he ascended on how and what did he do he gave gifts under me his apostles prophets his teachers his pastors it was the fruit of his garden my beloved has gone down into his garden to the beds of spices now she knows where his unidentified presence is and now she can call it the identified presence of God she's no longer where here is God it's God among us where is he now she can say I know Ray's that he is here hallelujah the Solomon in the natural parallel certainly took great delight in gardens and trees notice in Cleese yesyes chapter 2 verse 4 he says I made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit i made me pools of water to water that was the word that bringeth forth trees now notice this is solomon and the natural that solomon made him david didn't make him for it his mama didn't make him for him Mary didn't make this Bradford Jesus Mary does play no part in redemption there ain't another God in heaven that's an old man that played the part in this Redemption this is the mighty God himself there ain't two and 33 there is why he made the bride he made the church he made the hundred forty-four thousand he made the Holy Ghost he made preachers he made singing he may be anointing I made me gardens I made me pools I made me tree I made me fruit I made up he's the one who does o my notice what she says my beloved has gone down into his garden to the beds of spices their difference plants now with all the fragrances of time and cinnamon and the Sakuma and all these different things when you would walk in out our garden is not like a field finally some of them have already went out start paddling they'll put soybeans or corn or whatever more they may have to dis come up and plowed and get it read an issue they may pile but a couple more times for the most part Mitchell they leave it you can't do a garden with it a garden requires constant pruning cleaning whipping I mean picking up stuff you ought to be so happy to god that every time you come to church you get preached on it proves you're a guardian and not to feel effusive feel you would not to get no correction you learn how to get nothing that big hunka burning up all around you ever unites with corn and soybeans and they reach the end of their cycle they get so big you can no longer go in there and plow because you'll break them all down so what do you do you leave the cocoa birds in the church now I mean in the field so you leave the briars and the nettles and the thorns and the thistles you just go ahead and leave them there and then you divide them at the white throne judgment but if you are a garden you've got pads you've got ways in you've got ways out and you can go in and trim this off and cut that back and fertilize this and you can attend to every plant every Bush every every little flower because you allocated enough space in your garden for it I'm so glad I'm a garden aren't you glad your garden not just a big old soybean patch we're just so the sink don't you understand that's what these little sin purchased or do it that's why they don't get in people's lives and dealing they don't do this and you better not do that you know no no no no they're just soybean Christians we're just going Christian so they just saw it and that porn preacher stands up and he just so well I ain't got time to deal with clothes on religion I don't please or clothes on religion you're not preaching the gospel [Applause] but if you're a garden so over on the shady side you've got this Japanese maple you've got this green Laurel P then you've got the variegated one every third that you like to alternate you've got japonica you've got whatever more and you picked it according to the filtration of the light that would come down through it because you know if you take this shady area and you put a full Sun plant more than likely it will not bloom right if it blooms at all now in my grow and in my live but more than likely it will not bloom without the right amount of son of man tan take so much Sun to be able to make her grow and ripen praise the Lord so you got to be very picky and then you've got a little water aspect over here and then you've got this over there and that over that but you want to leave enough room to be able to get in around us so you go in and be able to pull this up and then we'll took her up around this a little bit nip that often cut this oh oh it's a big job it's a lot of work I mean God's been working on this for thousands of years now but you want to plow fields this coil our disc adept so you seed and go back to house God's making can we go on notice this now she says my beloved is going down into his garden to the bed of spices to feed to feed in the gardens to feed so Jesus Christ has come in this place tonight to feed in the individual garden hearts he's come to feed what are you gonna feed him the fellow him is here and he's come to feed what if you got for him now remember supplied that ministers to her husband right so what are we going to feed him building programs Democrats Republicans independents Trump's Obama's Clinton's I get sick of hearing all that mess aren't you glad we're going to a kingdom where there is no such trash and nonsense of politics so he enters into this place of his paradise and he's not just got flowers which are for observation he doesn't just have a difference plants which are there for many of them to bill but many of them are edible they are edible in verse three I am My Beloved's and my beloved his mind and again she says it he feedeth among the lilies never remember this is a restoration after he's knocked on the door and she delayed to come this is the restoration this is scene five when action this part of the drama to word that has now been restored and she's nervous herself anxious what's this response gonna be how is he going to do because Allison want to make the mistake I was the one it was slow I was the one who laid back on him what is he going to do to me but somehow she's got the revelation I am still my beloved the separation has now ended praise God his love for me remains as strong now as it did before I messed up praise God his communion between him and her what's in chapter 2 verse 16 she says a very similar thing my beloved is mine and I am his and he feedeth among the lilies but you notice as she grows on and matures she reverses it and her stability and strength is now evident by the way she's rewarding at saying exactly the same words but it's the order before she was placing it upon her love and her faithfulness how wonderful she was and how great she was but now she's got it in the right order I am My Beloved's and he is mine so it's not all about me and I got rid of all that free moral agency from Free Will Baptist stuff and all that sort of thing I sought God now sought God and I found out he grabbed ahold of my horns and pulled me to the altar with me actually doing it no way now what does he want he wants fellowship but it must be fellowship on his own divine command it must not be by us dictate well I think it'll be this one that way notice this little bit says he's risen from the dead he lives among us today and he wants fellowship back with his people again his great Majesty all night listen to this I love this his great Majesty his glory is now spreading forth he's desiring the fellowship again with his people like he did in the Garden of Eden again he says God longs for fellowship he yearns can you imagine Almighty God yearning for something and longing he yearns he wants people this is what he wants from you brother nd he wants people to speak with him to talk with him you sucking do this you can't do it God wants us to speak to another and talk to him it's not like some great deep theologian the standing up in all my all the villages get it this can bring a downward child can do it do you understand God wants our children to be able to fellowship with him this way not on the terms of a theologian that stands up and talks about the seals and the thunders and this and that and the other and goes over the tops of many people's heads but being able to instill in our children talk to him when you're little talk to him when you're little and be able to understand he wants to hear from you oh my lord I believe now that you are Jesus Christ the Son of God what's this by the Wrentham talking about how person gets saved and how they come to God I believe now that you're Jesus Christ the Son of God I recognize his blood went before me the Holy Spirit comes down and a miraculous power transforms your life picks you up and brings you into the inside of the veil speak the God the Holy Ghost transforms you picks you up brings you inside the veil and sets you down and thunder you have fellowship with God and commune with him as Adam did in the beginning in the Garden of Eden but brother don't have still got my mortal body I know friends and that's what keeps us from seeing the truth other the devil don't want us to see an element of this spiritual communion has been restored because of what Jesus done you're thinking it's going to come out your wallet oh my light so how much of it is already here [Applause] praise God the Holy Ghost picks you up transforms you and set you on the other side of the veil said now don't do me tell me you love me tell me how do you feel tell me how grateful y'all talk to me I want to hear ya I love this in Christ a mystery when he come on the earth he was the Tree of Life do you believe that in Rome what did they do he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed is he that hang on the tree become a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth a bride tree so here comes the son of man tree on the earth he gives his life and dies on a Roman tree by dying on the Roman tree it releases a broad tree from his body who but God could do such a plan the devil only saw him or hit a note is gonna set me free hit or never done what he done there ain't no way in the world can you imagine I imagine he got madder than a Hornet at himself and every demon that he had when he realized he was a very warm the very war now that actually helped God carry out his plan of redemption can you imagine when Jesus showed up down inhale hallelujah the Prophet said from the time that God said I promise you I'll give you a redeemer he said when Abel was born he thought that was him when Moses was born he thought that was him when shall I come he thought that was him but when he died and went down into hell and he kicked the door of hell Amla said I have arrived he said I thought I got you when I got Abel I thought I got you then I got Moses and he said yeah my blood is still hot on Calvary give me the keys hallelujah to God he reached over and grabbed the keys off of the devil side the Prophet said he kicked the door of hell shut shook everything off the walls and he sort of send it up on high with Abraham Isaac and Jacob [Applause] so here hangs the tree of love on a Roman tree giving birth to a broad tree so they took the tree of life down from the Roman tree laid The Tree of Life where in the garden of course in a garden they weep and they cry and they Shep the stone back because the Sabbath is coming on but he had a promise he didn't have 1100 tapes like you and I've got but David had prophesied and said I'll not leave my holy one of hell or suffer my Holy One to see corruption you imagine with one promise he could look death in the face and say you won't be able to hold my pass this time [Applause] hallelujah when they come to anoint the tree and make the tree smell that and take away the stench from the tree I found the tree was gone he didn't need but three days to germinate and get back up again oh they say whenever the Eastern customers when a man was calling away from his supper table one of the ways that his servants knew he was not done eating was by the way he folded his napkin if he folded his napkin a certain way they knew he was coming back but if he folded it in another way they knew he was done didn't it amazing that when the scripture begins to talk about Jesus raising from the dead that it mentions that he'd folded his napkin you know he won one of these days are all mortal bodies it's gonna fall like a napkin and will say we are God with mortality hallelu it will be folded so the Tree of Life hanging on a Roman tree and then they bury the tree and in three days I can't find him where's the trigger the Prophet said through that he brings forth a bride tree which will be the Tree of Life restored back to him as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden we saw big I mean you get done with this series of the Song of Solomon we never go me down with this series in the Song of Solomon we're still gonna be acting this out and eternity the Song of Solomon is going to keep right on living we're gonna say where's he at summers gonna say he said his garden garden but the man says no quarry to God made by the same word the same God made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back here in the Garden of Eden Eve was the tree of death she was never allowed to be the Tree of Life but the second Adam has changed you Eve you're not just born again you're gonna become the Tree of Life praise the Lord let me read another to Cannibal Corpse notice then one like the first Adam and Eve before sin separate and death now Christ the second Adam in life redeems his bride from death now on his way back to the original Eden restoring back his bride and fellowship back with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden sure Christ and his bride God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the lost Eve back to the original condition in the garden of it was close affairs where he is yours beloved where is he where is he calling churches book we see them these last days of Israel have been joined in love to the Lord and the enemy has been destroyed God will prepare his holy mountain is a new Garden of Eden for the bride and his and her attendants for the thousand year honeymoon upon the earth in it amazing when folk school may get married you know

the earth as Adam and Eve were in the garden and did not finish out the thousand years God's millennium seventh day they remember they was in the sixth day that's the time frame we don't know how long they were there we don't know how long there was in the sixth day of their time but they moved over into God's day the Millennium and in God's millennium Adam fell don't you see the foolish virgins and all those that don't come in the millennium and the heathen in the head of millennium they even many of them will choose not to serve God but that's not who you are praise God it will be a pre figure of the Mount of the Lord and we will step out on the ashes of the wicked and enjoy a thousand years now Jesus our last Adam and his Eve true church will fulfill all the plan of God praise God praise God thank you Jesus my beloved is in his garden finishing his meticulous work this is why in the heart of a believer he will not let nettles and bitterness and cockle burrs and all that until in the heart now you don't let nothing bitterness and hatred and anger and no not a horrible believer or if you're a worldly wheat Christian sure they can hate they can smoke they can do all kinds of things that your honor and they'll come up in the Tribulation Period but not garden people you know if you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're not yes you do one thing wrong he will not let you get back with it you just have an attitude toward somebody you're not even sure if the attitude is even right or not and you feel that little something you ought to be so grateful you're looking for signs of election and you're overlooking signs of the garden right in your very soul don't you understand what a meticulous caretaker you have in the garden of your life other people even people around the message they can live in your way and do any other thing and say they're going in the rapture there this said the other don't you pattern your life but them cornfield people don't you pattern your life by then bunch of cocklebur people you're a garden a garden each plan is individual it must be grabbed around it must be fertilized it must be dealt with individually or table to take your lifetime but when he gets down with you by the way it'll be a paradise a paradise of a garden he spare heads together oh well look at it in the morning then when he comes back in the resurrection of their love and he says all you are beautiful oh it says thou art beautiful oh my love as tirzah as tearsa comely as Jerusalem Amen how her heart must enter into rapture knowing that she's forgiven of her complacency and he looks at her as the crowning points of his kingdom tears oh and Jerusalem praise God Heavenly Father we bow our plant heads to the dust of the earth Lord were not interested so much in producing thousands and thousands of bushels as it were no wheat farmer will plough or maybe doesn't even plow I use his no-till and he wants as much out of a quarter as he can get or he wants as much productivity so sprays and does everything that he can because it's all about numbers bushels and bushels and more bushels Lord we're not counting numbers tonight you don't count your crowds you weigh yours the Lord's are not interested in getting the biggest following you're interested in quality character gardens for the most part will always be smaller than a hay field or a wheat field or a corn field because you just can't take care of it if it was 640 acres you'd have to have full-time gardeners many of them so many gardens will be so small I remember years ago and Carolyn I used to go through England and we'd stopped by brother and sister wilkinson's house and would fly into Heathrow Airport and then that morning and fly out of Gatwick that nine going to Zimbabwe or Kenya so would have an all-day layover and be the 80 would come and get us and take us to their little home would sleep for a while and then they get together some of the Saints together and would fellowship together and have a meal together and then take us back to the airport to fight around midnight or so and sister Margaret had it just a little wee place there in Sussex but she always wanted to show him me and Carol or a little garden it was small but she liked fiddle with it the Lord after brother Eddie passed she lived about a month or so and then she was gone too so now they're over there were it's all kinds of space so her little wee garden took a lot of time because each plant was so special to her each one nard this someone from Canada gave him Carolyn asked some flowers a couple of years ago from the garden of the famous artist himself Monet so it was quite something for us to have some of the seeds from his garden but Lord God I'm so glad that you dropped one of your seeds it's not from Monday it's not from Botanical Gardens in Asheville or Houston but is from the very mind of God praise the Lord because of mine differences in my scars as a human being and my frailty my dirt has allowed a lot of things to grow up around these plants but you're such a patient gardener Lord I pray you'd help each of us and highfather we can still say you're still working on me we're willing to say too not Lord we need more work we need more help well we know what you won't give up on one of your gardens help us operate to my father and many erase your hand with me and say Lord be mindful of me work on me Lord trim me shape me Lord I don't want to be a big old cornfield or a big old soybean field with everything in the world and my plants may be a lot smaller and there may not be near as many of them but they may be exotic and rare and delicate and they require special attention the harvest want me near as much it won't be no thousands of bushels as it were might just be one tree of this and one of that and one of another but when they're finished you will be able to see the Master Gardener worked in my life it'll be amazing when we all gathered there that day and we said at that table thousands of miles long how to walk the Master Gardener and they'll sleep Daryl said Paul the garden Peter the garden by the Wrentham the garden all those saints down through the ages and there are we'll set Lord little small people that men do nothing like what they don't but it'll be the same touch of the master that raised Moses the same one who raised Ezekiel and Jeremiah it'll be a same artistry of his work that's raised his plants in praise God we love you Lord Jesus Thank You Heavenly Father we bless your name tonight Lord God we raise our branches as it were up into the presence of the king may the wind of God come through this place as we raise our branches up in your presence and worship your name o Lord God we worship you tonight father we're still clothed in that redemptive robe but how we long for the day when the robe will be taken away when you change your garments as high priest we'll take off our redemptive robe because we won't need it no more if you ain't a priest no longer we don't need blood no more to speak for us then we'll be able to speak face to face lip to ear the restoration will it fully arrive to our bodies oh thank you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight mighty God thank you for your great plan Lord can we just love him a little bit children before they go oh don't you appreciate him don't you love the great story of God the story of redemption not only what he's done but what he's doing he's completing the final chapters or they say the final verses in the final chapter it's been written about us a man it's closing out of the Gentiles history praise be to God we worship you tonight Lord Jesus may the sweetness of the Holy Ghost just passed through among us tonight Lord and may you take your pruners if that's what needs to be Lord and Lord you little small shovel or whatever more Lord just dig around our lives dig around our attitudes and dig around Lord whatever needs to be if you find anything that needs to be cut off in this Lord your your so excellent in doing that father Lord we just submit ourselves to you as the garden of the Lord we see fruit in our lives but we want to see more fruit we want to be more

needful how blessed we are birthday there must be a people on the earth that's getting ready for eating time praise speak to God oh let's get ready children stay ready I realize some of the message folks there so called up and their preacher someone sent me a video clip this week a couple of them and the singers of the church were setting their singing to the pastor and they'd wrote songs about the pastor and called him the pastor Papa and calling the pastor all kinds of adoration and all these sorts of things and the pastor was sitting there singing the song wisdom about himself so people in South Africa are singing about their pastor and calling him Elohim well I realize I'm not deep and I realize I don't know as much it's probably a lot of those folks know we still love singing about the Lord Jesus [Applause] [Applause] if you get up here singing about me you gonna get a whuppin you go sing about us and how great we are and how wonderful this scent nothing you gonna get whooping I'm just telling you you're going to get whoop there's one great one among us there's one who deserves praise and adoration the other God it's the Lord Jesus friends he is our Savior he is our Redeemer all brother Donnie you don't understand you got that right I don't understand how anybody could be that ignorant that they'd want to worship some preacher somewhere and adore some preacher on everyone I was born the same way you are needed salvation just like you and still dealing with their old carnal flesh just like you're dealing with yours we want to make love to one person and that's Jesus Christ how many feels that way tonight oh praise God is he your everything is he your all and all [Applause] hey speak to God there's no one like him I said there's no one like him raise the Lord Jesus first thing something before we go hey oh praise God I'm sorry friends if you get tired of me talking about Jesus you get tired of me preaching how great he is you get tired of us singing songs about him I'm sure you can find someplace else to go but as long as I'm the pastor we're gonna exalt the Lord Jesus Christ we're gonna sing about him we're gonna talk about how great he is we're
