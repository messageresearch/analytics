willing and U not to say how much we appreciate him and love him here in our church he's been such a dear friend to me and helped me so much down through the years and I just wanted to mention to you today brother Daryl I don't say you where are you where is he happy birthday brother Daryl we love you [Applause] buddy praise the Lord Psalm 771 to the chief musician to jusen a Psalm of ASF a Psalm of ASF I'm not sure if you're familiar whether or not but David wasn't the only one that actually contributed to the Book of Psalms there were some other men that did as well some of them were in charge of the music some of them actually wrote part of the Psalms this one is what is called a Psalm of ASF a Psalm of ASF I want you to listen to the words now carefully I Cried unto God with my voice even to God with my voice and he gave ear unto me in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord my SAR ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted I remembered God and was troubled what a strange thing to say I remembered God and I was troubled I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed Sil La thou holdest mine eyes waking I am so troubled that I cannot speak I have considered the days of old the years of ancient times how may like to be remembered today as we pray we have several needs of course in our church and I'm sure that all of you are very familiar of them some very very serious and we want to keep our brothers and sisters before the Lord in prayer we'll pray over this prayer call for brother Steve Newsome today so I appreciate if you'd remember uh me for that as well let's let's pray together Lord Jesus we bow our heads to the dust of the Earth from whence we were taken and no one day we will return to that unless we're called away in a Rapture first father as we approach your word today we're asking for your help you saw the needs that were signified by the uplifting of hands all over this place today and we're just bringing them before you some might seem small some might seem totally impossible some might seem as if though there's no way for it to happen but we know our God Specializes in impossibilities so father we bring them all to you large mediumsized small dear God we're asking today for your help help me Jesus help me to be able to get out of the way father to speak the words that will be beneficial to your people today we commit the service and the word to you now father speaker and hearer in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated we don't know too much about Asaf we certainly don't know what he was dealing with what he was going through whenever he actually pinned these words but it must have been something so tremendous and it left him speechless it left him to where that he was so overwhelmed by the circumstance the events one or many that he was going through his sleep was being taken at night the thoughts of his mind were overwhelming him the surroundings that was near him the daytime the nighttime everything was interrupted and he does the only thing that he knows to do now being being a psalmist and a singer and a musician they live in a different world anyway they operate of course by inspiration the only true songs that can ever be written are by inspiration some people write songs and you can tell they wrote them but when God gives them to you it's different and then whenever you climb into that sphere and you get it from God and then you come back down it's not when you're up there when it's there it's awesome wonderful but it's when you come back down in the transitory time of coming from the high to the low and from the low to the high so ASF must have been that type of an individual that he knew what inspiration was and he knew what it was like to walk in the presence of God and to be blessed by God let's read verse one again if you don't mind to the chief musician now apparently this this brother had a a joint working together and we know that the Levites actually there were songwriters and singers and musicians and so on as part of the Levites the Levites also took care of the sacrifices they also bore the we of the Tabernacle and the temple several things that they did but some of them would be more songwriters some of them might write the songs and they may not be singers others might sing and they may not write there was probably some of them that were blessed to sing write and play music but ASA we don't really know to the extent of what that he did but ASA actually gave this to the chief musician so it was the musician that was in charge of the choir or the music and that day maybe he was the one who put the instruments together so ASAP received this no doubt from he felt like the Lord a Psalm of Asaf I Cried unto God with my voice even to God with my voice now the Hebrew mannerism whenever they would repeat something something twice and you notice the Lord Jesus did it often in the New Testament and he would say verily verily I say unto you well Jesus didn't stutter it wasn't that he had a stuttering problem but it was their mannerism whenever they would repeat the same thing twice there was a great significance in what they were about to say so Asaf wants to make it sure to the readers now remember this was a Psalm which was a song but we know they put it together and we identify it as scripture so he said I Cried unto God with my voice even to God with my voice and he gave ear unto me now he recognizes that the straight that he's in that he's went to God and he he says it to verify it that he Cried unto God and that God did hear him and then he says in verse two in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord and my SAR ran in the night in other words my troubles did not dissipate they did not lay back even when the night season would come and we know how that is sometimes when we get our sickest is in the nighttime fever's raging and we can't rest and just adds to what we're already going through seems like so he said my sore ran in the night whether it was a natural Affliction that he was describing or whether he was taking a parallel which many time these writers would do that they would use a parallelism which was they would take a natural thing and use them words to describe a spiritual thing we don't know but we just know that he wanted us to get the impact of it my S ran in the night and ceased not my S ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted now watch we're getting into where the trouble is laying in the basis of this Psalm uh I'm I'm sure probably if you've been saved very long that most of us have been in a spot like this maybe never quite to the depths that Asaf was at but he was in a spot to where that people were coming around him and maybe even the presence of God and maybe he was remind Ed of a former Psalm say F Psalm 46 Psalm 33 Psalm 103 the blessings of the Lord whatever it was and yet there was something about the situation he was in he was in such deep despair that his soul refused Comfort I want you to think it wasn't that Comfort was not offered but he himself actually refused it anybody ever been there where people try to encourage you and most of the time when a child of God will do that it's not that they're trying to be mean it's not that they're trying to be indifferent but what they do is we let me say it this way we that we evaluate the comfort that they offered us and that it was so small in comparison to what we are going through and people will say well I know what you're going through and and we may not say it out loud but we will say it sometimes in our heart no you don't no you don't you don't know what I'm going through well I lost a a husband I lost a wife I lost a daughter but see the way we look at our own situation we consider ours so special and so unique not another human being on the Earth has ever been what we've been through and just remember when you're thinking that that's the devil right it is not the spirit of God because no matter what we go through many people have been before us and the Lord Jesus has went through more than us all put together but notice what a situation now that a person can be in so ASF says that that I rejected all those consolations were offered to me by my friends by my superiors by my my comrades my contemporaries and I remember this brother would have been a man of renown to be identified as one of the chief men you'll find his name several times in the Book of Psalms whenever this man would have come around and they was having singing conventions and they were practicing music this man would have been a man that the musicians and the singers and the orchestration guys all of them would have said wow wow there's brother as Hey Brother as how are you doing how you doing so he was not what we would say that nobody knew him so no doubt whatever it was he was going through the different ones had tried to encourage him and try to lift him up but he refused the Comforts as if though they were they were too weak for his case others maybe were untrue maybe others were without feeling you know you You' you've been there when people just try to well I know what you're going through and we all go through it and which is one of the worst things you can say by the way I've stood in many many funerals and stood at the head of the casket by the families and here are some of the things that people say and you think they've been better off they had even open their mouths just shake your hand and smile and go on and then you can watch the families as they say these feelings that words without feelings and and it's just like that it's you know nothing there and maybe ASA had received a few of those but the danger was not so much the Frailty or the failure of the people maybe they just didn't know what to say and in that time who does who does but his soul refused Comfort when we get to our friends we're in a serious situation maybe he considered them unhallowed they were not sacred enough for the declared situation to be able to use such frail words to en to encourage or comfort him with such [Music] distress so he said I refused him people said we're sorry I hate you going through this I'm so sorry he said I wouldn't even hear them you know I found that God in his mercy no matter what we're going through God puts people in our lives and around us to help us but it doesn't do any good if we don't receive it as you know it won't be but a few weeks away that it will be a year on the 16th day of October that the Lord decided it was time for my little girl to come home and I don't mind telling you I don't know how we as a family would have been able to go through what we've been through with that if it hadn't been for you all my friends around the world I'm constantly getting things from people all over the world I don't know how we would have dealt with it without your prayers your emails your texts your cards but you know what no matter how much the Lord would have put it on your heart to say something to me or to Carol or to the girls or to Lance or to the Parker side of the family which loved her as if she was their own daughter it wouldn't do any good no matter how much you felt led to do it if we wouldn't receive it as from the Lord himself I believe God uses his children to be God and skin to be able to put their arms around us and help us but we have to receive it so whatever it was that Asaf was going through it must have been something very similar to what Jacob went through whenever the brothers come back and told him that Joseph had been killed and Genesis 37:35 and all of his sons and his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for I will go down unto the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him him now he don't know it but he's actually doing all this for a lie right it wasn't even the truth and it's the same way when you and I go through things and the devil tells us that God don't love us and God don't care for us and if he loved you how would he let this happen and let that happen that is a lie and yet we will allow the devil to make us feel terrible and if we're not careful we'll get an attitude against the only one that can help us through those problems somebody say amen amen now what here Jacob no doubt it was absolutely overwhelming how he must have felt when his sons come he don't know they're lying to him and they tell him is not this your son's coat and we found it out there and they took a a blood of an animal and put it on there and you're this Prophet is being deceived by his lying Sons isn't it amazing and God lets him believe that is that right notice again in Jeremiah 31 a prophecy that would be fulfilled hundreds and hundreds of years later whenever Herod the king would actually send out a proclamation that all the newborn children males 2 years old and younger were going to be killed they're trying to kill the Messiah of course thus sayith the Lord a voice was heard in Rama lamentation and bitter weeping Rachel Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not what a dangerous position that we as children of God can get to and I've seen it so many times as a pastor that when people will get low and they go to missing church and they go to pulling away from the body and I will call them the deacons will call them maybe you will call them because they're your friends oh everything's good we're fine you know but you can tell something's not right and they don't come to functions anymore they don't hang around if it's youth they don't hang around the youth and and come to youth meetings and you know what the devil's doing he's trying to isolate them away from the body amen and believe it or not no matter what we do and how much we we do nine times out of 10 people who get in that frame of mind will always blame me or they will blame the deacons or they will blame the church I find that to be so amazing most of them will never take the blame where it should be which is on themsel they were the ones who pulled away from us they were the ones who isolated away from us but you understand what's going on in their mind the devil has got this whirlwind going on they don't understand where they are they don't understand why God's letting this go on in their life so Jacob was at that spot the children would not be restored back of course in the New Testament and Rachel in the symbol there Rachel was weeping and crying and would not be comforted notice as ASAP goes on in verse three I remembered God and was troubled why in the world would anybody remember God and be troubled what often occurs help me Lord God in the case of a good man or woman that by dwelling on this dark incomprehensible ible situation that they're going through and things that God allows to come to pass in their life the soul becomes so sad and so troubled to an extent of bordering on murmuring and complaining anybody ever been there besides me and Rebellion I remembered God and was troubled he who is the Wellspring of our being he who is that every blessing we've ever got our entire life he is the source of it all and yet we remembered God and we were troubled hope this don't sound unusual to you but for those of you that have prayed for God to do a certain thing and whether it was a a sickness or trouble that you were going through and God didn't answer it in the way that you saw and you felt a little disappointed sometimes a lot disappointed you don't have to raise your hand on this but if any of you that's ever been through such a thing and then somebody else will turn into testimony that they prayed about this and this and this and God did it for them and he didn't do it for you isn't that an unusual feeling that we feel when God does that anybody ever experienced that and you find yourself sitting there in church when someone reads that praise and say oh everybody around you that hasn't experienced that maybe and they're just praising the Lord and the brother or sister who turned in that testimony they're so happy and they're so grateful to God of what God did and you're sitting there with some mixed feeling and you're thinking God I thank you that you did that for them but why didn't you do that for me I believed you I loved you I asked you with all of my heart you told them yes and you told me no come on I mean knows what I'm talking about oh I see so there's some asfs and Asaf s's I guess that are here in the service today wow so this must be the reason why yesterday when I thought I was ready for today and the Lord totally turned me completely around and in a matter of 45 minutes or so he started opening up this Psalm to me to be honest with you this has never been one of my favorites how many's got favorites and then others you read them and they're God's word you know but somehow the Lord just opened this up I thought God there's got to be a reason there's got to be a reason oh Hallelujah maybe there's more than one now notice where he where he is in this and his his heart his heart is distracted so he says I thought of God I I remembered God and I was I was troubl you know memory is one of the the great things that God gives us it's a wonderful thing attribute of the spirit of course we know but we also know the memory can be so painful so hurtful things we've done wrong things where we fallen short of the glory of God things that we wish we could go back and redo and undo and erase isn't it amazing that one aspect of memory how joyful and yet how painful Carol and I was walking through troyers one day this week and those of you that know what it is it's a grocery store type thing but where they package their own foods and things like that and I got a buggy up in the front door and started down the right hand side and meandered our way through there and as I started getting close to this certain section all of a sudden I started having these flashbacks it was the bread section and they have a a bread there called a sourdough bread and all of a sudden as I walked through there I relift time and time again how many loaves we've purchased for Erica cuz she loved it and there was times when she was taking her chemo that she could already eat anything but she was able to eat the souro bread so sister Robin which worked there kept her supplied in it we didn't know but it was a big sale day and there's people in there everywhere and I tried to find a place where I could get away cuz tears is pouring out of my eyes and my wife is comforting me and you know it is people looking at you with your eyes all bloodshot and they think you've been on a drunk or whatever but what did it brother ter memory yes sir memory notice in verse four he said thou holdest mine eyes waking I see this is the danger literally thou keepest the watches of my eyes my grief is so great God I can't sleep I'm troubled I can't sleep notice and he says I cannot speak now think of who this is saying this a singer a songwriter a man that was identified in one of the special categories of the children of Israel a psalmist a psalmist a man that was used by God for what words words right this defined this man's life the usage of words but brother Robbie no longer knew what to say you imagine how he must have felt that holdest mine eyes waking I'm troubled that I cannot speak his Spirit was so Sun with weariness and heaviness anybody ever be broke in your spirit I'll tell you I went through it several times in my life friends as a minister where you get under such a load for people either because the church body's going through so much and let me tell you something I may not see you all every day of the week Carol and I may not be able to shake every one of your hands every time we have church but you are constantly on our hearts when you're going through through anxiety and troubles in your life we bear those burdens right with you because God has given us a shepherd and a shepherd's wife we have you on our hearts and let me tell you something she may be a silent partner in this work but she is a great one I thank God for my wife for the last week or so been waking up 2 or 3:00 in the morning not able to go back to sleep because so many people going through this and that and the other so we know what that's like do we not to lose sleep and whenever we go through that then of course the devil loves to talk to us in those we hours of the morning does he know you see Asaf is so shut up within himself it's as if though the Fountain of the flow of words by divine inspiration were not even there look in verse five he says I have considered the days of old the years of ancient times I called to remembrance as he's remembering of course the good times oh boy man I remember how it used to be I had this walk with God I was this and that my I remember the trials used to wasn't so bad I many remember those days I'm trying to I'm trying to but remember better days are ahead of us I've considered the days of oh so his mind is going back the years of ancient times and I call to remembrance my song in the night why is he remembering it because in this state of his life it's like he can't get a song he can't even harm among all the pains and Pleasures which make up a part of the human life lought in life this is one of the most painful the more real the more Vivid the pain and pleasures of memory every one of you are sitting here today and you have both isn't it amazing how extreme they can be and how contrasting they can be one from the other the pain and the pleasure of memories so Asaf remembered the ancient times the former days he goes back and he said I called to remembrance my song in the night Lord God my song in the night which had been an occas by which he could praise the Lord he could lay down at night thank you Lord for the day thank you for your blessings thank you for peace thank you for water thank you for food thank you for this and all my just had such joy and he couldn't not even sleep maybe for a while he just reach over and had a pad maybe and a pencil as we'd say in this day and he' ride over there there it right there was another song and that was oh my my what great songs of victory but now ASF is singing a different song but I'm so glad God anointed ASF to write Psalm 77 as sure as I'm a servant of God this is sent not only for Word of Life Church but it's sent for others around the world world Amen I've never even preached on Psalm 77 before in my life the Lord God no doubt had this written for people down to the ages but it's spoken today for somebody right here in this audience listen to him children you know me I'm a dummy but our God is absolutely perfect oh my I called to remembrance my song in the night I commune with my own heart heart and my spirit made diligent search I'm looking I'm trying to find have I done something wrong if I miss the Lord somehow why am I going through this time that's a wise thing to do is it not there's nothing wrong with that the matter of fact the prophet tells us that that he himself would go through those times and he would turn every stone over in his life and find out God is say something I've done wrong he would ask God and if there was something done wrong he'd fix it and he said then you turn every stone in your life and it seemed like God still don't answer and he said that's the time to be certain of god notice in Psalm 42 verse 8 now he could refer to this Psalm yet the Lord will command it loving kindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me Hallelujah now you better believe the devil knows God's word this is a promise of God this one was written by King David you imagine the devil saying to Asaf so if you are such a chosen vessel of God how come your song ain't in the night he ever use the word against you of course he will of course he will yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the day time and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life but ASF said I ain't got no song don't seem like I've got nothing to be happy about notice in verse seven will the Lord last off forever will he be favorable no more now watch in this part of the psalm he moves into the Avenue of unanswered questions and watch him he has one after another after another amen will the Lord cast off forever and will he be favorable no more if I lost favor in his sight will the Lord cast me off forever is his Mercy clean Gone Forever does his promise fail forever more look at him brother Daryl one question after another after another after another and no one answers it's a question and answer series between ASAP and God and ASA is is submitting the questions to God but God does not answer is this Mercy clean Gone Forever does his promise fail forever more has God forgotten wow to be gracious now remember this is a singer a songwriter a musician who stood under the anointing of God rubed shoulders with King David one of the most shouting dancing men of the Old Testament but I guarantee you ASF saw David in those low times as well how low this must have been for a guy that we'll call him the service Le leader so when the children of Israel would come on the days of the Feast of trumpets and the Feast of atonement and Y Kor and all these great feasts it was brother Asaf and he would get up there and they'd strike up the orchestra and they would start singing and oh my they'd worship God and worship God now Asaf is in this place brother Asaf would you lead us in a song Brothers I I just don't think I can do it today y'all pray for me you imagine the congregation saying what is brother ASF going through we can tell something's bothering him has God forgotten to be gracious has he in Anger shut up his Tender Mercies now look at the the degree of angle by which he approaches and he's asking God all these different things wh what is this friend is this an unbeliever is this an Infidel this is a person that God is being silent to them and they don't know what to do in reality this is one of the most pitiful helpless human beings you'll ever run across they have known the mercy of God they've known the grace of God they have my they have been so blessed in the Heavenly places in Christ but when they get down they get down oh my and I said this is my infirmity something must have happened this is my infirmity but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most high amen now I guess the question is for you and I today what will we make verse 10 say in our story now I've read to you these n verses and we go in to the the drama of his life and the loness of his battle now something happens apparently between verse 9 and verse 10 did he see lightning hear thunder did he see a flash of light or was there just a germ of life on the inside of his soul and the spirit of God simply Struck it and he said Hallelujah this is my infirmity but I will remember the years listen the years of the right hand of the most high amen now we see a person in verse 10 who is somehow brother Daryl by the grace of God been able to rise above verses 1-9 and realize God has been so good to me if God never answers another prayer if God never heals my body another time if God never even looks my way once more if the Lord never does one more good thing for me the rest of my life I want to tell you today as a 68 year old man who's been serving Jesus and preaching for 50 years and living for him since I was 12 years old he has been so good to me he has healed me when I'm sick he's Lifted Me Up When I was down he has given me friends around the world he's helped me when I did not deserve it he's been good to me when I did not deserve it he's Lifted Me Up When it seemed like there was no way out oh I wish somebody would preach with me this morning now let's leave verse 9 and get up to verse 10 and let us realize God has been good to us all no matter what we're going through today and you may have heard devastating news but you don't want to wallow in just verse one and two and three and four and so on to verse n but you want to rise by faith and say but I remember when I was lost I remember when I was out there in the world and Jesus found me I remember I was in darkness I remember the years of blessings on my life and I said this is what's important about this verse it was not the levitical choir standing behind him maybe by now even King David had heard that his main Psalm writer next to him was going through such a dilemma and David said he'll help your brother ASF maybe jedu and and the other ministers and the Ministers of music and they all came to him but it wouldn't do any good until ASF made this his confession I'm the Lord God that Health the Hallelujah I'll never leave thee I'll never forsake thee I'll go with thee all the way to the end of the world and I said this is my infirmity but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most high now you know symbolism of course of the Old Testament of the right hand God said that by his right hand and by his right arm that he brought salvation the right arm is a symbolism of power he did not live under the influence of the left hand but he lived under the influence of the right hand for years Oh Glory I will remember the works of the Lord surely I will remember thy wonders of all what's going on with him Harry something now from within his Spirit remember memory is an attribute in your spirit and Satan has access to it just like God does but keep this in mind it will depend upon which one of those memories that we will focus on come on somebody oh I don't mind telling you I've got a lot of memories about a lot of things in life just like you do but you know what Carol and I was talking before we come to church and was talking about erican coming up on the oneye anniversary and all of that and I said but you know what honey I said God in his Mercy allowed us he blessed her us rather by allowing her to be a part of our family God blessed you sister Linda and allowed you to be married to brother Jimmy God blessed you sister Judy and let you be married oh Hallelujah to your husband God bless you mothers and fathers and whatever more that lost a son or a daughter and God blessed you to let it be part of your union if you look around today you've got a whole lot more to praise him for oh I know you may be setting here with pain and sorrow and you're going through a lot of things in life but don't just count verse one verse two verse three down through verses nine I think it's time for some of you at Word of Life to move into verse 10 of your life and say yes I think of my sister yes I think of my brother my father but God let me enjoy all these years with her and God let me enjoy all these years with my husband and the good thing about it is soon and very soon we're going to meet them all again and we will never part again I refuse to let the devil dominate my life I've got this big old hole in my heart no doubt it will never be totally completely filled but I've still got a church to Pastor I've got sermons to preach I've got sick to pray for come on children let's have church I've got people to encourage I've got to work before me I refuse to let the devil rob me of the rest of my life I'm not going to sit around and be sad and depressed I have no time for depression I have no time to be down and out I've called of God to walk in Heavenly places say so brother I will remember the works of the Lord surely I will remember thy wonders of all I will meditate also of all thy Work and talk and talk so you're going to meditate you're going to sink on it and then you're going to talk about it don't you understand the devil does exactly the same thing he'll get you and I to think about the downside the bad side the low side the painful side all that sort of thing and then what do we do most of us don't keep it to oursel but we talk about it well I don't understand why God let this happen I don't understand you're doing exactly what the devil wants you to do but oh Asaf must have got a new song hallelujah oh he said I will meditate on the good things of God I'm going to think about the days of old I'm going to remember the right hand blessing as a matter of fact I think I'm going back under it right now I'm I'm getting under that right hand blessing I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God come on children somebody say Amen you imagine him saying praise the Lord I may not feel no better I may not shout the first time I go back to church but I'm still a Son of God I'm an heir of eternal life he loves me and spite of what the devil said he's on my side he's for me and if God be for us who can be against us I will meditate also of all thy Work all thy Work and talk of thy doings thy way oh God is in the sanctuary who is so great a God is our God I want to ask you today Word of Life who is so great a God as our God hallelujah we have seen him do marvelous things among us have we not brother Rob Weber I heard testified about it having all kinds of stomach trouble and he come up for prayer the Lord healed him and move for him right brother brother Daryl tell me about it brother JD got bit by a spider probably a brown recluse I made a hole in his hand lost feeling in around his hand had an open place I saw it the other night whenever brother Nathan was here he I said Brother D what's going on so he told me what it was couldn't feel no more around it it was oozing constantly so I told Brother Darren brother Nathan let's pray for him right now we laid our hands on him before church ever started we laid hands on him before we ever heard one special song you know why our brother had a need he walked in the office this morning and he pulled his shirt sleeve up and said I want you to look at this what did God do it was the blessing of the right hand oh hallelujah our god is Among Us he's Healing The Sick he's filling with the Holy Ghost and today he's here to comfort so Jesus said unto them all ye that weary and are heavy laden come unto me and I will give you restall my arms ain't big enough to embrace all of you in one big Embrace at one time I would if I could cuz I love you that much but Jesus can what will you remember Lance to minute long ago he said but Donnie what hurts me so bad it's because I learned to love Erica so much he said that's why it hurts I said I understand I said but Lance I want you to think about the human beings that live on this Earth and are never never in their marriage or any other love relationship in their life do they ever love with that depth of love and God allowed you to experience it and because you did it hurts so bad when it's gone but it's a sign that it's a love that will never end and she's there waiting for us on the other side oh hallelujah hallelujah Thou Art the god that doest wonders well praise the Lord let me read verse 13 again thy way oh God is in the sanctuary now all of these things that I'm going to read to you if you believe it's truths I want you to enunciate it by saying amen th way oh God is in the sanctuary am who is so great a God as our God Thou Art the god that doest wonders thou Hast declared thy strength among the [Applause] people so what happens to the question in an answer session we don't have any instance where he ever even got the answers but you see the change was in [Music] ASF the change was in they thou art a God that doest wonders thou has declare thy strength among the people thou Hast With Thine arm redeemed thy people amen amen the sons of Jacob and Joseph and Don and Frank and Fred and Bartholomew and whoever your parents' names are he has redeemed us we once were lost but we're not lost anymore look it's like he found an Avenue to praise in in the midst of this low spot of his life the water saw thee oh God the water salty and they were afraid the depths also were troubled imagine Jesus could have quoted this scripture after the boat ride on the sea of G gilee when he was there that night and when it was such a tumult wouldn't you and he stepped to the bow of the ship and said peace be still he could have quoted this Psalm and said this day this scripture is fulfilled well let me tell you something he's still a seaw walker he's still a water calmer he still can take oh Hallelujah the clouds and roll them away and the lightning and the Thunder dissipate at the command of his voice who is like our god oh the Hindus the last count that I had they had over 33 million Gods complete utter nonsense and there's not a one of them that's even true the Buddhists have got their God Shintoism taism all of that that there is no God like our God Amen he is not made by man but he become man that he might make Sons and Daughters of God out of Sinners let me find a place to close the water saw thee oh God the water saw thee they were afraid the depths also were troubled the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad the voice of thy Thunder was in the heaven the Lightnings lightened the world the Earth trembled and shook thy way is in the sea and thy pass in the Great Waters maybe some of you are there today and you're wondering why in the world am I am where I am maybe his path for you and this season is in the waters and in the sea but remember our God is still a sea walking God Amen and I know we talk about Peter we talk about him failing and he did but I don't want you to leave Peter in the water him and Jesus was a ways from the boat how far we don't know come on now but Jesus reached down and picked him back up Peter still had to walk back to the boat W Glory maybe you failed in a miracle let God complete your way back to the boat for you let him reach down and pick you back up and say come on boy let's walk back to the water you imagine Jesus and Peter walking back to the water I fell but I got back up again I fell short of the glory of God but he reached down and picked me up how many can say Amen to that today hallah thy way is in the sea and thy paths and the Great Waters and thy footsteps are not known Hallelujah thou lettest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron a PSAL of as like many of our songs they can start out pretty sad but the ending can be tremendous yes sir maybe the song of your life today you're in that chorus that place of the music the prophet told us that the great story of God is like a Divine Symphony the symphony written by these people who write them somehow they hear all this in their head which is always a Marvel to me how they can do it and they will have the flute and the OBO and the first vile in and and then the cello and you know the base and and all these things and they can hear all this going on in their heads so in the Garden of Eden the father allowed the symphony to start playing [Music] [Music] and the devil come in Devil and they saw uhhuh I destroyed it all so the father come on the other side of the Garden of Eden and started saying down through time he's felt like he's destroyed on the cross he felt like he got the sheet music and annihilated it all but then he he's a knock on the door of hell and there stands the mro himself and when the devil opened the door he [Applause] went you thought when Jesus went away that was the end of the church they fussing fighting arguing debating Ain't No Way in the world they'll ever get together but on the day of Pentecost here come the Great Master right what did he do and what did they do started speaking in tongues wo glory to God what was it the language of the master he saw down through seven Church ages he had annihilated the church in the days of Luther in the days of West and the days of Pentecost come on now but he sent another message on the earth in the last days and the devil said now what's he going to do with this so the master walked to the pull pit and said and what did we start doing and what are we waiting for the great mro himself when some morning between 7 and 9 we feel a sweep go over us Lord God and we'll see our mothers our children our fathers standing around us and we know won't be long we're going to be changed what's he doing everybody's taking their chair in the orchestra so we're all getting together and then all of a sudden the master say are you ready children and those that have been dead for thousands of years and those that are alive been changed and we will all be to say Hallelujah Lord Jesus you see our needs today Father I know you well enough to know you would not have had me to go this way today unless there was at least one person that had a great need of this today so Lord if it wasn't but for one after all you would have come to the earth I believe and given your your life for one I'm glad she would have done that cuz that one might have been me May the presence of God go to every heart today maybe there's an ASF that's going through a real hard time maybe they've been there for a while I know Lord we have several in our church it's l loved ones sister June losing her husband sister Lyon unley losing hers Lord sister Judy passing brother Daryl mentioned to me before service Lord we know that each one of us have been touched by this and you're your s experien the loss of a friend when you were here and you wept so great Myro we know that your path will lead us through these Waters the depths may seem like they're overwhelming at times but we know he who has the sheet music sees this is not the end this Carol and I stood the other day at that Happy Valley Park and we walked by Brother Randy gon ERS marker there on the way down to Erica's and brother Jim Babs marker across the hill brother and sister Stamper across the hill and different ones through that Cemetery that I've buried through the years but the Sheep music tells us they're not there anyway praise the Lord oh Jesus comfort each heart today father I pray we worship you Lord God great adoni we bless your name Lord Jesus how many loves him today with all your heart brother Byron Palmer sent me a quote the other day and I thought it was absolutely astounding the prophet had the people to lay hands on one another and to pray for each other brother Bram whenever he did he said I I seen that man standing right back there pointed in direction of where a man was and he said I seen that man right there just get healed as he laid his hands on somebody else to pray for them and I thought isn't that awesome isn't that awesome so you're praying for somebody else and God heals you you mind if we offer prayer today for each other maybe some of you have not experienced great grief and a great sorrow but I tell you what you can do you can pray for those in our our assembly who have some are going through some of the greatest Trials of their life right now this very very day so together we want to bring them before God so you're praying for that person besides you God knows what they have need of brother Daryl brother hate

remember even though it's been 29 years just the other day I drove across the railroad track and I was back there again again and I started weeping because it was so real but you know one thing I found in the troubles that we have went through in our lives is that in our darkest times that's when God always showed up the [Music] greatest and sometimes you wonder you say why is this Affliction of this back trouble or whatever it would be but I wonder sometimes if we don't endure those things so we can have compassion on someone else who's going through that because when you can't get out of bed in the morning or you lay your head on the steering wheel and cry because you can't really get out of the car to pump gas and was so comes up and says I've got my back you can understand it because you've been there amen the greatest thing we can ever do for one another is have compassion for one another as the soldier boy was trying to carry the man off the battlefield he said sorry g ain't Heavy He's My Brother aren't you glad that we have a god who's the lifter of our heads amen amen God is so good to us amen we singing something to I get ready whatever's on your heart brother oh

things of life and give me a little bit of her background and her history and not been walking in the evening light that long but just to hear what God had done for her such a wonderful thing God performed A great miracle for her whenever she was a child in her home Home Country having cancer being operated on the only anesthesia the only sedative that they had was drinking alcohol you imagine going through such an ordeal but when she come out of that it's a little girl 9 years old God started dealing with her heart went from one place to another to another searching searching praise God the Lord found her thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah heavenly father it's an honor for us Lord to stand always here to baptize your children dear Jesus you see my sister you see father that many of these things things are new to her maybe she doesn't understand it but talking to them yesterday and feeling the witness of the spirit of God in their hearts seeing the sincerity of her heart and I

attitude to what happens to you amen so let's go from here and take these things that we heard and I'd say if the brother wrote this Psalms could have gave it a name it probably the title of it would have been rising above verse 9 I'm so glad we can rise above verse 9 aren't you may the Lord bless you amen go in the fear of the Lord enjoy your your afternoon with your family and friends your plans that you have made remember the service Wednesday night and just come back just trusting to be great testimonies of the wonderful things that God have done for us amen sing it for us again buddy amen

always are watching he's waiting on me to fall but I've been through the storm and the wind and the rain still the same I know I've got victory over the enemy and the world can do me no harm yes I've got victory over the enemy and the world can't do me no harm oh no harm no harm no harm no harm yes I've got victory over the enemy [Music] [Music] [Music]
