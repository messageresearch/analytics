[16:07] morning each and every one of us father
[16:09] there had to be somewhere that we were
[16:11] reminded of the Frailty of this old
[16:14] flesh we looked in the mirror we saw
[16:16] something that we didn't see 20 years
[16:18] ago 50 years ago 10 years ago and it's
[16:22] just a reminder that we're going to a
[16:24] land we have to make it to that place
[16:28] father the world is crazy and the the
[16:32] the the strains and things that people
[16:34] are attaching themselves to they are
[16:37] feeling the pull of a body change and

[45:40] morning how on the world can I fix that
[45:48] mess praise the Lord ain't it wonderful
[45:51] to be a child of God
[45:53] today to be able to gather together in
[45:55] the presence of the Lord and we realize
[45:59] during this time of the year a lot of
[46:00] folks get all religious and you know we
[46:02] talking about the birth of the king and
[46:05] all that but I'm glad for the real
[46:08] people of God it's not just something we
[46:10] talk about once a year it is the reason
[46:13] we
[46:14] live he came that we might have life and
[46:18] have it more abundantly I'm so grateful
[46:20] for that today aren't you let's uh turn
[46:24] the scripture if you would today to the
[46:26] book of second Timothy chapter
[46:29] 1 while you're turning there I'd like to
[46:31] make this announcement Dan and Lynette
[46:34] Robbins and Larry and Sher Jenkins would
[46:38] like to announce the engagement of cin
[46:42] Robbins to Josh
[46:53] Jenkins we're happy for him and we're
[46:55] praying that he'll move up his way so he
[46:57] don't take another one of our daughters
[46:58] of God down there in the Egypt land in
[47:00] South
[47:02] Carolina I told him years ago God
[47:04] delivered his people out of them swamps
[47:06] what in the world would anybody want to
[47:07] go back
[47:09] for it's beyond
[47:12] me amen was that you brother Tom and
[47:15] said
[47:16] amen he's praying for deliverance of his
[47:18] family too from down there
[47:20] something amen praise the Lord second
[47:25] Timothy chap 1:
[47:28] 7 for God hath not given us the spirit
[47:31] of
[47:32] fear but of
[47:34] power and of
[47:36] love and of a sound
[47:39] mind so fear exaggerates the causes of
[47:45] fear without Inner Fear exaggerates the
[47:50] causes of fear that are without so the
[47:54] spirit of power is simply the the spirit
[47:56] of God in a person's soul that helps
[48:00] them it imparts a power to help them to
[48:03] overcome fear aren't you glad for that
[48:06] yeah so this power is actually what cast
[48:09] fear out we can't do it on our own 1
[48:13] John 4:1
[48:16] 17 herein is our
[48:19] love
[48:20] made
[48:22] perfect I want you to notice that when
[48:24] you get this love
[48:27] it's not
[48:29] complete but it has to be
[48:32] made complete herein is our love made
[48:37] perfect look at the meaning of the word
[48:39] with me to Leo to finish fulfill make
[48:46] perfect complete to carry through
[48:50] completely to accomplish bring to an end
[48:55] add what is yet wanting in order to
[48:58] render a thing full so a lot of times
[49:02] when we use the word perfect we think of
[49:04] perfection and sinlessness and without a
[49:07] fault but that's not the way John is
[49:09] using this about perfect love it's love
[49:13] that
[49:14] reaches its height its finish its
[49:19] end I trust each of us want that today
[49:22] with all of our hearts how many like to
[49:24] be remembered today as we pray before
[49:26] the Lord got a couple of prayer calls
[49:29] here today that we' like to pray over as
[49:31] well no doubt many needs we know we got
[49:34] several that are sick in the church
[49:36] today and unable to be here so we just
[49:38] pray that God would be with us let's
[49:39] just bow our heads
[49:41] together Heavenly Father we love you so
[49:44] much today we thank you for your grace
[49:46] and mercy to us Lord we're just asking
[49:49] that you would help us in this service
[49:52] you see our needs and they are many Lord
[49:55] we have
[49:56] several that are sick today and unable
[49:58] to be in service maybe some came and
[50:01] they weren't feeling well but they
[50:02] pressed beyond their feelings to come
[50:04] anyway so we pray that you just be
[50:07] mindful of each one Lord those that are
[50:09] streaming the service from around the
[50:11] world whatever their needs might be
[50:13] would you be mindful of them as well
[50:16] father we've come that we might be
[50:18] benefited by gathering together Lord
[50:21] Jesus we're so grateful that you come to
[50:23] the Earth if you had not
[50:26] we'd all be lost and we're grateful that
[50:28] you didn't just come and heal the sick
[50:31] you did that before you even died but if
[50:34] you would have done all of that and then
[50:37] ascended up into heaven and never given
[50:39] your blood we still would be lost
[50:41] today and we're thankful not only for
[50:44] healing but for
[50:46] salvation so may you be mindful of these
[50:49] needs Lord God these prayer requests
[50:51] that I have in my hand you know the
[50:52] needs dear God and we're asking you for
[50:54] your mercy
[50:56] help us Lord I I'm no doubt I'm the most
[50:59] needy person in the building today I
[51:02] need your help to try to speak something
[51:05] that would help your children encourage
[51:07] them strengthen them maybe lift them up
[51:09] whatever more they need help me father
[51:11] that I can get out of the way I pray in
[51:14] the name of Jesus and the Saints said
[51:17] amen God bless you you may be
[51:24] seated
[51:26] I'm sure most of you would agree with me
[51:28] today that this life offers us hardly
[51:34] anything that is
[51:36] perfect there are no perfect churches
[51:39] there are no perfect
[51:41] preachers we hear people say well so and
[51:44] so and so and so has a perfect marriage
[51:46] you ought to be with them when they're
[51:48] not so perfect
[51:49] though so there's very few things when
[51:52] you think about it that is actually
[51:56] perfect think we could place them on our
[51:59] hands perfect moms perfect dads perfect
[52:02] this perfect that hardly anything that
[52:05] you and I could think of today that
[52:07] would actually be perfect but yet God
[52:11] has given us a way to where we can have
[52:15] perfect things but they all must come
[52:18] from him perfect Faith perfect love many
[52:23] things that God's given us but yet when
[52:26] we look at what the description or the
[52:29] definition if I would ask you hundreds
[52:31] of people here today how many of you
[52:33] would say well perfect love is this this
[52:35] and this I'd ask this brother maybe
[52:38] these young men here I'd ask brother
[52:39] Nathan maybe some of you sisters what is
[52:42] perfect love well your definition might
[52:44] vary from one to the other you say well
[52:47] perfect love is this and perfect love is
[52:49] that and someone else is saying no it's
[52:51] not that it's it's totally different
[52:53] it's this and that and the other but
[52:55] we've been looking at the rights that
[52:57] God has purchased and given for his
[52:59] bride the elect of God and absolutely I
[53:03] believe that perfect love is one of our
[53:07] rights it's not only a right it's
[53:11] actually a
[53:12] requirement to ever be able to move into
[53:17] the sixth Dimension if you go by the way
[53:21] of death it's the only way you'll ever
[53:25] never be able to enter into the essence
[53:28] of eternal life now eternal life is
[53:31] something we know that is given to some
[53:33] at the white Throne judgment given to
[53:35] them the opportunity to be able to go
[53:38] into the kingdom of eternal life but
[53:41] there are people on the Earth today that
[53:44] already have eternal life now many think
[53:47] they get it when they believe on the
[53:48] Lord but we know a thorough study of the
[53:50] scripture shows us that it's more than
[53:52] just accepting him as your savior so as
[53:56] if it is one of our rights and actually
[53:58] a requirement I think that each of us
[54:01] should be so determined more than
[54:03] anything else in the world after
[54:05] everything that we get so you have your
[54:08] goals you have your motives your
[54:10] objectives as we call it in this day
[54:12] your bucket list of what you want to do
[54:15] where you want to go things you want to
[54:17] see or doubt each one of you do there's
[54:19] things you want to do before you pass
[54:22] there's things you'd like to accomplish
[54:24] things you'd like to see for your family
[54:26] things you'd like to see maybe for our
[54:27] church and yet all of that might be well
[54:31] and good but none of those things might
[54:34] be inclusive to allow you to be able to
[54:36] enter into the paradise of God but
[54:40] perfect faith will so money is not a
[54:44] requirement thank God good looks ain't a
[54:47] requirement double thank God for that
[54:49] I'm so glad that wealth and notoriety
[54:52] and popularity it's not a requirement
[54:55] but for one who went beyond the curtain
[54:57] of time and come back and told us what
[55:00] it was like and they actually told him
[55:04] what he was already preaching but he had
[55:07] not quite made the connection that the
[55:10] Holy Ghost was perfect love so once he
[55:14] went there and came back then they told
[55:16] him this is what you preached was the
[55:19] Holy Ghost this is perfect love so the
[55:24] way John States it here perfect love is
[55:27] not something that's separate from
[55:29] Divine love or separate from divine
[55:32] nature it's actually the same thing only
[55:35] stated a little bit different but this
[55:37] is different than the gifts now we
[55:39] believe in the gifts here we thank God
[55:42] for the spiritual gifts but these are
[55:45] Divine Graces not Divine gifts the
[55:49] Divine Graces are hope and charity and
[55:52] those things but Divine gifts are
[55:55] totally different now I've seen gifts
[55:57] all of my life I've seen folks prophesy
[56:00] speak in tongues interpret I don't know
[56:03] that I've actually ever seen a perfect
[56:06] one
[56:08] yet and I believe the reason is because
[56:11] the foundation of the gifts is not
[56:15] Divine
[56:16] love but it's to desire to be a gifted
[56:20] person more so than upon the basis of
[56:24] perfect Love Now is it important are
[56:27] gifts important absolutely they are so
[56:29] important the Lord would never give them
[56:31] if they were not important but in my
[56:33] years and my tenure in Pentecost and I
[56:36] would see people speak in tongues and
[56:38] prophesy and interpret and you know most
[56:41] of the time it was just a questionable
[56:43] something or it would be hit and miss
[56:45] and they would hit and miss and hit and
[56:47] miss and we know the prophet tells us in
[56:50] the church age book that it would come
[56:51] in the last days that there would be
[56:54] those that that would operate gifts with
[56:57] a margin of error in them a margin of
[57:01] error so they would be able to call
[57:04] somebody out or prophesy over them or
[57:06] whatever and they would hit this one hit
[57:08] that one hit that one and then maybe
[57:10] Miss every fourth one or every third one
[57:12] or every fifth one and they would miss
[57:15] it was constantly hit Miss hit Miss now
[57:18] can a person like that have a real gift
[57:21] from God yes they might really have a
[57:23] genuine gift from God
[57:25] but if it's not built upon the
[57:27] foundation of perfect love perfect love
[57:31] is the only thing that produces perfect
[57:35] gifts now perfect love is not something
[57:38] any of us can have on our own there's
[57:42] not one human being that has ever lived
[57:45] on the earth after the fall other than
[57:48] the Lord Jesus who ever had perfect love
[57:52] I love the way the prophet explains love
[57:55] and he says it was like the great big
[57:57] ocean that God's love was like the ocean
[58:01] and then it trickles down from a lake to
[58:04] a smaller stream and then a smaller one
[58:07] and a smaller one and it trickles down
[58:09] and trickles down and the farther down
[58:12] it comes from the original ocean the
[58:15] less pure it is in its nature so those
[58:19] of you that love your husbands and wives
[58:21] tonight y'all too thank God but if you
[58:23] don't have divine love then that's what
[58:26] causes divorce that's what causes
[58:28] separation is because a man and woman
[58:31] they get tired of each other and they're
[58:33] human love they fall out of love with
[58:35] each other the same way they fell in
[58:37] love they can also fall out of love but
[58:40] if they have Divine love coupled with
[58:43] their human love then their human love
[58:45] will help them to love their husband or
[58:47] wife even whenever maybe they're not
[58:49] really lovable because that's the way we
[58:52] were we were not lovable when he saved
[58:55] us and filled us with the Holy Ghost
[58:57] then he actually made us lovable aren't
[59:00] you glad now this is part of our rights
[59:04] as the people of God let me read this to
[59:06] you uh the prophet says it this when
[59:08] every man here tonight would realize
[59:10] that things that you got Divine health
[59:12] and everything else God gave it to you
[59:14] at Calvary every born again man is
[59:17] circumcised by the Holy Ghost and you
[59:19] have a right for every Redemptive
[59:22] blessing let the devil rob you of none
[59:26] of it now it ought to be our
[59:27] determination whatever God has for me
[59:31] I'm going to get it before I leave this
[59:33] life amen it makes no difference if it's
[59:36] spiritual Supernatural if it's natural
[59:39] blessings whatever he wants me to have I
[59:41] want every one of them now listen how
[59:43] this couples together now in the
[59:45] restoration of the Bride tree he
[59:47] promised to restore the church in these
[59:49] when the evening light shine we're
[59:51] living in it and by restoring we have a
[59:55] right so by the restoration of the
[59:58] message of Malachi 4 then it brings to
[1:00:00] us a right notice he said we have a
[1:00:03] right we have our attorney we have our
[1:00:08] lawyer our high priest and we're going
[1:00:12] to force a claim so we have a right
[1:00:16] first of all as the children of God and
[1:00:19] then we also have the ability to force a
[1:00:22] claim you've had them long enough
[1:00:25] you can't do it any longer we're
[1:00:27] ordained in the name of Jesus Christ now
[1:00:30] love like every other Grace is something
[1:00:34] that will be revealed in degrees now
[1:00:37] remember when you receive the true
[1:00:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is
[1:00:41] everything you'll ever need in seed form
[1:00:45] in you is the potential of your rapture
[1:00:48] of your body change of every healing of
[1:00:51] every Revelation you'll ever need but
[1:00:54] see being that Divine love is a Grace
[1:00:57] like hope like faith it does not come to
[1:01:00] you in the fullness of that whenever you
[1:01:03] receive it so God will allow that Grace
[1:01:06] to grow and grow and grow so love is in
[1:01:11] you when you're born again by the spirit
[1:01:13] of God but is it perfect love it is not
[1:01:17] I I wonder if we would be able to look
[1:01:19] tonight or today rather and God would
[1:01:22] pro project it on these screens here the
[1:01:25] name of every person that's here this
[1:01:27] morning every person on one side would
[1:01:30] have perfect love and those on the other
[1:01:33] side have love but not perfect or mature
[1:01:37] love I wonder how many of us it would be
[1:01:41] I wonder how many of us that have been
[1:01:43] saved for maybe years but yet our degree
[1:01:47] of love has never entered the proper
[1:01:50] Temperance to where God would identify
[1:01:53] us as m mat love that it's reached its
[1:01:58] end and then when it reaches its end
[1:02:01] you'll be able to live at the end of
[1:02:04] that love now you may be allowed to live
[1:02:06] for 6 months 5 years 10 years who knows
[1:02:09] how long it'll be but when you've
[1:02:11] reached the end then you move into that
[1:02:14] final Temperance of love you are ready
[1:02:18] for the sixth Dimension you are ready
[1:02:21] for deaths if that be the will of God
[1:02:24] for your life and then if not then you
[1:02:27] are ready for the height of your service
[1:02:30] to God like you've never been
[1:02:34] before now whenever John begins to write
[1:02:37] about this and he's the only one that
[1:02:39] actually uses these terms together and
[1:02:42] John sets it forth I love the way that
[1:02:44] he writes it whenever he says then that
[1:02:46] hereby is our love made perfect so it's
[1:02:50] made perfect so it's not received in the
[1:02:53] fullness form it's received in seed form
[1:02:56] as graces are Grace is different than
[1:02:59] gifts the gifts are wonderful they are
[1:03:01] marvelous and I believe according to the
[1:03:04] word of God that gifts are something
[1:03:06] that God placed in the church himself
[1:03:08] and I believe that if we could ever walk
[1:03:10] into love first then we would see a
[1:03:14] manifestation of real perfect gifts in a
[1:03:17] way that we've never seen it before
[1:03:20] because then it would be with no
[1:03:23] selfishness are no self-center this you
[1:03:25] see a lot of people actually have Divine
[1:03:28] gifts but they're still operating it in
[1:03:31] a measure or a Temperance of love that
[1:03:34] has not yet reached maturity because you
[1:03:37] watch them when they use that gift and
[1:03:39] they'll turn it always right back around
[1:03:42] and it's well I prayed for so and so and
[1:03:44] this person got healed in my church or
[1:03:47] this person got healed in my prayer line
[1:03:49] and this person done this and all they
[1:03:51] say they're giving testimony to the
[1:03:52] glory of God but it's it's amazing
[1:03:54] because they hardly ever testify of what
[1:03:57] God's doing in other churches or what
[1:03:59] God's doing in other preachers lives
[1:04:01] it's always what God's doing in them and
[1:04:04] their church and their life well y'all
[1:04:06] didn't say Amen to that now you see
[1:04:09] perfect love has no problem with where
[1:04:12] God is doing Miracles even if it's
[1:04:15] outside of their own
[1:04:17] church a preacher that has perfect love
[1:04:20] and operates a Divine gift he can re
[1:04:24] choice just as much if God performs a
[1:04:27] miracle raises the dead heals the sick
[1:04:29] and someone else's ministry as much as
[1:04:32] he can his own why because his gift is
[1:04:37] operated on the basis of perfect love
[1:04:40] that has reached a stage of maturity now
[1:04:43] many men I believe with all of my heart
[1:04:45] they love the people of God and they
[1:04:47] love God and they want to operate gifts
[1:04:49] in order to help people but they do it
[1:04:53] on a basis of immature love imperfect
[1:04:57] love and then it will always come back
[1:04:59] to them and you watch them oh I know I
[1:05:01] hate to Hate to repeat it but I saw it
[1:05:03] so much in Pentecost and I'm seeing the
[1:05:05] same thing again in the message and it's
[1:05:07] just coming right back around again
[1:05:09] gifts here gifts there gifts somewhere
[1:05:11] else and someone told me the other day
[1:05:13] that young ministers are feeling so
[1:05:15] under the pressure that they've got to
[1:05:17] see a vision or have a dream or call
[1:05:19] somebody out I'm thinking what in the
[1:05:21] world is the matter with us why do we
[1:05:24] we have to go back that way and if we're
[1:05:26] not careful we're going to point people
[1:05:28] to become nothing but a generation of
[1:05:31] sign Seekers that's all they're going to
[1:05:33] be they're going to be a generation of
[1:05:35] sign Seekers and they will not be able
[1:05:38] to take God at his word without a
[1:05:40] feeling or a shout or a jump or a vision
[1:05:43] I believe in all of that but I Take God
[1:05:47] at his word without feeling anything I
[1:05:51] believe God Is A Healer whether I have a
[1:05:53] dream dream or whether you have a dream
[1:05:56] or whether you see a vision about me or
[1:05:58] not I believe God's
[1:06:02] word signs follow
[1:06:05] me I don't follow them but you watch
[1:06:09] people people are relocating they're
[1:06:11] moving there's a big move on again in
[1:06:13] the message and people are moving we a
[1:06:15] lot of moving to Jumping shouting
[1:06:18] churches sign seeking churches well
[1:06:20] that's well and good if you're LED with
[1:06:22] the Holy Ghost to do that but if you're
[1:06:24] just following a sign I feel sorry for
[1:06:27] you cuz Jesus tells us in the last days
[1:06:30] there will be people that will have all
[1:06:32] kinds of signs you see I saw this in
[1:06:34] Pentecost to where they preach
[1:06:36] constantly signs wonders Miracles but I
[1:06:39] never heard Matthew 2424 preached the
[1:06:41] whole time I was there so they did not
[1:06:44] warn their people of false anointed ones
[1:06:47] I see the same thing reoccurring again
[1:06:49] in the message that we're preaching
[1:06:51] anointing jumping shouting hollering all
[1:06:53] of that but has anybody got time to
[1:06:55] still preach Matthew
[1:06:57] 24:24 well I do I do and I'm going to
[1:07:00] warn you everybody that jumps and shouts
[1:07:03] ain't got it everybody that even lays
[1:07:05] hands on the sick ain't got it you need
[1:07:07] to broaden your spectrum a little bit
[1:07:09] and realize there's Miracles among
[1:07:11] Pentecostal people there's Miracles and
[1:07:13] healings and signs among Badness oh I
[1:07:16] don't believe it brother Donnie I sit
[1:07:18] right in the hospital with Erica and a
[1:07:20] woman come in a nurse come in and sit
[1:07:22] down and talked with us one to one of
[1:07:24] the Baptist Churches here and she was
[1:07:26] telling us of the different Miracles
[1:07:29] they had seen in their church you've
[1:07:31] come too late to tell me they don't have
[1:07:33] them they do but we tell them there she
[1:07:36] sit with bobhair painted face britches
[1:07:38] on everything else so if Miracles is all
[1:07:40] we need if that's the bride's Revival we
[1:07:43] might as well quit preaching Holiness
[1:07:45] then we might as well quit preaching the
[1:07:47] message why bear the reproach of being
[1:07:49] identified under Malachi 4th healing is
[1:07:52] all you need but we need more more than
[1:07:54] healing we need more than jumping we
[1:07:57] need all the word and yes healing is a
[1:07:59] part of the word but also is Holiness
[1:08:02] and clean living and righteous living
[1:08:05] come on somebody preach with me today
[1:08:07] with man shall not live by bread alone
[1:08:10] but
[1:08:11] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:08:15] mouth of
[1:08:16] God you see a man with a lower intensity
[1:08:20] of love will always bring himself into
[1:08:24] this I wonder sometimes if we still see
[1:08:26] at Lance and I was talking yesterday I
[1:08:28] told him you know Lance the reason that
[1:08:29] the Lord Jesus came one of them was that
[1:08:32] he might be able to bring a
[1:08:35] crucifixion to this thing about human
[1:08:38] love that we love and we love selfishly
[1:08:43] I'll just preach to myself today because
[1:08:44] I'm sure everybody here is a perfect
[1:08:46] angel and really doesn't even need this
[1:08:49] but boy there's some sorry folks that
[1:08:50] stream our services and and no doubt it
[1:08:53] it might be for Brother David mayor over
[1:08:54] in France or it might be for somebody
[1:08:57] over in Belgium brother Josh maybe you
[1:08:59] over in Belgium you might need to hear
[1:09:01] this message brother tune in real good
[1:09:03] and listen
[1:09:05] now so the temperance of love that will
[1:09:08] be released into the bride before the
[1:09:11] Rapture now you know the prophet tells
[1:09:14] us in shreport in 1965 when he rehearsed
[1:09:17] going beyond the curtain of time he said
[1:09:19] I believe the people that will go on the
[1:09:22] Rapture will be in this state before
[1:09:25] they leave now he was talking about
[1:09:28] perfect
[1:09:30] love perfect love is not selfish so it's
[1:09:33] not self-centered and there's something
[1:09:36] about all of our loves that's
[1:09:38] self-centered yeah you love your wife
[1:09:41] there's still an element of self
[1:09:43] involved what can she do for you and
[1:09:46] most of the time your arguments in your
[1:09:48] home you don't have to raise your hand
[1:09:50] or stand up but is it on the basis of
[1:09:53] divine love
[1:09:54] that y'all get into arguments come on is
[1:09:56] it on the basis that she's telling you
[1:09:59] you're being too good to her and too
[1:10:01] sweet and you're just so nice I'm mad
[1:10:04] I'm I mean you're making me mad you're
[1:10:07] so good to me woman I just can't take it
[1:10:10] no more shut down being so good to
[1:10:13] me y'all ever had anybody to tell you
[1:10:15] that but what is it you're not treating
[1:10:18] me right you're not doing this right
[1:10:20] you're not selfish youself
[1:10:25] so he's the first one since Adam when he
[1:10:27] come to the Earth to be able to express
[1:10:31] perfect love divine love which had no
[1:10:34] selfishness involved so you take a
[1:10:37] preacher very gifted so he can really
[1:10:39] speak really gifted and what God will do
[1:10:43] with that man will be measured according
[1:10:45] to the intensity of the love that he has
[1:10:49] as his Revelation grows now if his
[1:10:52] Revelation grows go and advances faster
[1:10:56] than the intensity of his love for god
[1:10:58] you watch what he'll become stuffed
[1:11:01] shirt know it all we know matter more
[1:11:04] than anybody else our church is the only
[1:11:06] church in the message oh my I get so
[1:11:09] sick of hearing that trash I get so sick
[1:11:11] of hearing all of that you know there's
[1:11:13] only two or three messages in the
[1:11:15] message churches that's really got the
[1:11:17] enlightenment of everything you better
[1:11:19] wake up and realize God's Prophet saw
[1:11:22] Millions on the curtain of time I
[1:11:25] personally don't know of any message
[1:11:26] churches that's got
[1:11:28] millions well praise the Lord but what
[1:11:31] is it you see a preacher with his gift
[1:11:33] if he does not operate and the more you
[1:11:36] learn how to preach of course and the
[1:11:38] more you learn how to surrender to God
[1:11:40] the more you will realize the intensity
[1:11:43] of your gift matching the intensity of
[1:11:45] your love and the more you get out of
[1:11:48] the way the more he can do it will be
[1:11:50] almost Limitless what God will do for an
[1:11:54] individual like that may may I not limit
[1:11:56] it today just to a preacher but if every
[1:11:59] lay person here men women boys girls
[1:12:01] teenagers whatever you are if we would
[1:12:04] fall so in love with him that we loved
[1:12:07] him more than everything else in this
[1:12:09] world it would be amazing what God would
[1:12:11] do in our church and yet we have a
[1:12:14] direct thus saith the Lord I have never
[1:12:18] found in all of my searching of the
[1:12:21] message of the Decades that I've been in
[1:12:23] it I have never found one thus saith the
[1:12:27] Lord you must shout thus sayth the Lord
[1:12:32] or you will not be there or one thus
[1:12:35] saith the Lord you must speak in tongues
[1:12:38] or one thus sayeth the Lord you've got
[1:12:41] to have a March around Jericho now if
[1:12:44] somehow I've overlooked that please send
[1:12:46] me the quote and I'll resend this
[1:12:48] statement on Wednesday or I can save you
[1:12:50] the time and say it ain't there but we
[1:12:54] do have a thus sayth the Lord it will
[1:12:57] take perfect
[1:12:59] love to get you there do we believe
[1:13:03] that do we seek
[1:13:08] it do we want it more than money more
[1:13:12] than position more than rank more than
[1:13:16] favor of
[1:13:18] people well let's just face the facts
[1:13:20] the truth of it is most of us don't want
[1:13:23] it
[1:13:24] bad
[1:13:28] enough some of you spent years working
[1:13:31] on a degree at school you applied
[1:13:34] yourself you studied nothing wrong with
[1:13:37] that as long as you don't make an idol
[1:13:38] out of it but I wonder if you would take
[1:13:42] that kind of urgency and
[1:13:45] desire for perfect
[1:13:49] love day and night you're hungering
[1:13:52] you're thirsting God I've got to have it
[1:13:55] I've got to have it I I want it more
[1:13:58] more fluent in my life I want it to such
[1:14:02] a Temperance that I find out someone in
[1:14:06] the church said something about
[1:14:09] me now human love will do
[1:14:12] this if I seen one of the brothers
[1:14:14] outside flirting with my
[1:14:18] wife human
[1:14:20] love now I'm not a violent man
[1:14:26] but I might feel kind of
[1:14:28] violent if I seen some man in this
[1:14:30] church going up taking a hold of my
[1:14:32] wife's hand and saying sister Carol you
[1:14:35] look so beautiful today I'd like to take
[1:14:37] you out on a date but unless he's a
[1:14:40] blind man he ain't going to be able to
[1:14:42] take her out cuz I'm going to see he
[1:14:43] ain't got no eyes left at least swole up
[1:14:46] for a few days well you see that's what
[1:14:49] the prophet said that a man would do
[1:14:52] with human love someone would say
[1:14:54] something to your wife and you'd want to
[1:14:56] hit him I'm just fulfilling the quote
[1:14:58] you see but he said perfect love would
[1:15:02] look at that man and forgive the man so
[1:15:06] then if someone places something about
[1:15:08] you on Facebook whether directly or
[1:15:10] indirectly and then someone tells you
[1:15:12] have you found out what so and so said
[1:15:13] they're talking about you I know they
[1:15:15] are they haven't mentioned your name but
[1:15:16] they might as well they have said you so
[1:15:18] which love do we operate out of human
[1:15:21] love or person love
[1:15:25] brother
[1:15:27] amen y'all enjoying this so much we
[1:15:30] might have service again this
[1:15:34] evening well there's going to be 20 of
[1:15:36] you show up the rest of you is going out
[1:15:37] for dinner and going home trying to
[1:15:38] recuperate ain't you now you see when
[1:15:41] love is perfected in us we have no fear
[1:15:46] of the
[1:15:47] Judgment no fear whatsoever When Love is
[1:15:51] perfected in us we we have no fear of
[1:15:55] death no fear of dying amen When Love is
[1:15:58] perfected in us we have no fear of what
[1:16:02] Satan can do to try to destroy us but
[1:16:06] when it's not perfect that's whenever
[1:16:08] you'll see a fear gripping people about
[1:16:11] death and about sickness what's this in
[1:16:14] Divine love the prophet said among other
[1:16:16] people everywhere is fear but love
[1:16:19] perfect love casteth out fear the reason
[1:16:22] you're fearful is is because the right
[1:16:25] Temperance of Love Now notice he doesn't
[1:16:28] say love is not entered into you but the
[1:16:31] right Temperance of love has never
[1:16:35] entered yet so you do have love but it's
[1:16:39] never grown and mature when there's real
[1:16:42] love all fear passes away when you
[1:16:45] really love the Lord now watch this in
[1:16:49] rejected King I Heard a Voice then that
[1:16:51] spoke to me that was in in the room and
[1:16:53] said this is what you
[1:16:56] preached was the Holy
[1:16:59] Ghost
[1:17:01] this is perfect
[1:17:04] love and nothing can
[1:17:08] ere without
[1:17:11] it so the sixth Dimension is the Holy
[1:17:15] Ghost
[1:17:17] personified in theophany
[1:17:20] bodies are you imagine the inter and
[1:17:23] he's overwhelmed by what he sees and the
[1:17:25] way they're acting and the way that he
[1:17:27] feels cuz he he he felt different than
[1:17:29] he had ever felt before and all he could
[1:17:32] feel from these people and the women
[1:17:34] came first and they were hugging him my
[1:17:36] precious brother my precious brother and
[1:17:38] the brothers then came my precious
[1:17:40] Brethren now they were women in
[1:17:42] form and they were women in shape and so
[1:17:45] on but he said here we have the man has
[1:17:48] one gland the woman has another but he
[1:17:50] said there they were still in formed and
[1:17:52] in shape of women but yet that feeling
[1:17:56] could not be there toward them the way
[1:17:58] that it would be down here so he was
[1:18:00] overwhelmed by it because these women
[1:18:02] were coming hugging him and there was no
[1:18:05] human sexual
[1:18:06] response so that was different the glow
[1:18:09] the glitter in their eye he mentioned
[1:18:12] that over and over again there was
[1:18:13] something about their eyes our eyes now
[1:18:16] cannot be able to contain the
[1:18:17] illumination of light that they have in
[1:18:19] the sixth Dimension so their demeanor
[1:18:22] was different everything about the
[1:18:24] sphere that he entered into was so
[1:18:26] different and the voice said this is
[1:18:28] what you preach was a holy ghost you
[1:18:30] imagine thinking the Holy Ghost I mean
[1:18:33] did I didn't preach about the Holy Ghost
[1:18:35] being blue grass and the Holy Ghost
[1:18:37] being perfect love and the women but he
[1:18:39] had preached it but it hadn't yet quite
[1:18:42] been quickened to him till he went there
[1:18:45] so he said this is what you preached was
[1:18:48] the Holy Ghost well wait a minute you
[1:18:50] know now they were running and yet we
[1:18:51] have no record that none of them jumped
[1:18:53] shouted spoken tongues or anything like
[1:18:55] that and no doubt they may have already
[1:18:57] done it they may have done been running
[1:18:58] and jumping my I don't know what all
[1:19:01] they do when they're there but that was
[1:19:03] not what the emphasis was upon it was
[1:19:06] not on any physical manifestation it was
[1:19:09] what was emanating from their souls
[1:19:12] which had now stepped into a theop now
[1:19:15] remember threes is a perfect
[1:19:17] identification of who you are as he is
[1:19:20] Father Son and Holy Ghost so are you
[1:19:24] Soul spirit and body when you leave this
[1:19:27] life you're still yet to be identified
[1:19:30] in the three so the soul which is the
[1:19:32] seed Gene of God leaves out of this
[1:19:34] Mortal body and it goes into what a
[1:19:37] sayopony body in the sixth Dimension
[1:19:39] your twos waiting for the third phase
[1:19:42] which is the resurrected body and the
[1:19:45] resurrection but there even though they
[1:19:47] had entered into that something he was
[1:19:50] identifying that this is what you preach
[1:19:52] was the Holy Ghost now he talked about a
[1:19:55] woman that he had went with a girl that
[1:19:57] he had dated what a great Christian
[1:20:00] woman she was and brother Daryl sent me
[1:20:01] this quote the other day and he said
[1:20:03] that whenever he went beyond the curtain
[1:20:05] of time he actually saw that woman there
[1:20:10] so she come up to him and identified him
[1:20:13] and recognized him and said oh our
[1:20:15] precious brother now would you notice
[1:20:17] this voice which was an Angelic voice a
[1:20:21] spiritual Supernatural voice this is
[1:20:23] perfect love and nothing can enter here
[1:20:26] without it I am more determined than
[1:20:27] ever in my life that it takes perfect
[1:20:29] love to enter there there was no
[1:20:33] jealousy now we can love God and still
[1:20:37] have an element of that love mixed with
[1:20:39] jealousy let me tell you why because our
[1:20:41] love for God can still be affected and
[1:20:44] if we see God blessing somebody a little
[1:20:47] more than us if we're not careful we'll
[1:20:49] fight jealousy it's among preachers
[1:20:52] friends I'm telling you you watch God
[1:20:54] raise up a man and God use him for this
[1:20:56] that and other and if a preacher ain't
[1:20:58] got the right Temperance of Love he'll
[1:21:00] fight it don't sat there and look at me
[1:21:02] funny I've had preachers to come and
[1:21:04] tell me I'm jealous of this man I'm
[1:21:06] jealous of that man I'm jealous of you
[1:21:08] I'm jealous of that man that don't mean
[1:21:10] they're evil that means they're human
[1:21:12] beings and they've never yet entered
[1:21:14] into the right Temperance of love yet
[1:21:18] but real love can look at God raise up a
[1:21:20] man and use a man and maybe you'll maybe
[1:21:23] be this High spiritual and he'll be a
[1:21:26] giant in God but the real love of God
[1:21:29] said thank God for using my brother
[1:21:31] thank God for using my brother cuz it'll
[1:21:34] benefit the whole bride of Christ well
[1:21:37] praise the lord it's a same way with
[1:21:40] singers it's the same way with
[1:21:43] musicians I think I might go in the
[1:21:45] office and preach the rest of this
[1:21:46] sermon it's the same way with deacons
[1:21:49] and trustees and whoever more can we
[1:21:52] stand for God to use somebody and bless
[1:21:55] them a little more than He blesses us
[1:21:57] and not have an
[1:22:00] attitude oh praise the Lord notice there
[1:22:04] was no jealousy there was no tiredness
[1:22:06] there was no death sickness could never
[1:22:08] enter there mortality could never make
[1:22:11] you old and they could not cry think of
[1:22:13] that they could not cry there was just
[1:22:17] one Joy oh my precious brother rejected
[1:22:21] King whatever you do for friends lay
[1:22:26] aside everything else till you get
[1:22:30] perfect love get to a spot now he's
[1:22:32] going to help identify what perfect love
[1:22:35] will be get to a spot that you can love
[1:22:39] everybody every
[1:22:42] enemy everything else that one that one
[1:22:45] visit there to me has made me a
[1:22:49] different man I can never never never
[1:22:54] never be the same brother
[1:22:57] brandham that I was so did Brother
[1:23:01] random just get the Holy Ghost
[1:23:04] no but that had such an effect on
[1:23:08] him that it helped him move into a
[1:23:12] Temperance of love that he never had
[1:23:18] before I've had I don't know how many
[1:23:21] people to tell me and to share with
[1:23:25] me since Erica moved beyond the curtain
[1:23:28] of
[1:23:29] time that they had never had such a
[1:23:33] greater desire to go to
[1:23:36] heaven that had done something to them
[1:23:40] and had such an effect on
[1:23:43] them I find that amazing and here the
[1:23:47] prophet going beyond the curtain of time
[1:23:49] had preached for
[1:23:51] years had spoke spoken tongues had had
[1:23:54] miracles in his ministry and that this
[1:23:56] is 1960 and he started on the field back
[1:23:59] there the angel come to him in 33 so for
[1:24:02] decades Harry had had all kinds of
[1:24:03] Supernatural in his life all kinds of
[1:24:06] phenomenal oh my wonderful tremendous
[1:24:08] things happen and yet been able to go
[1:24:10] beyond the curtain of time and
[1:24:12] experience that had such an impact on
[1:24:15] him watch him again in this adoption
[1:24:17] series and he said thus saith the
[1:24:21] Lord
[1:24:23] it'll take perfect
[1:24:25] love to put you in that
[1:24:28] place for that's all that was
[1:24:33] there so there's no human
[1:24:36] love mixed with an element of
[1:24:39] jealousy there was no Divine
[1:24:42] love even mixed with an element of
[1:24:47] jealousy so he's just
[1:24:50] overwhelmed I want you no notice he
[1:24:52] never saw streets of
[1:24:54] gold he never saw
[1:24:57] Mansions because that's a little bit
[1:24:59] higher he never said nothing about great
[1:25:02] you know things like that but it was on
[1:25:07] Earth
[1:25:09] magnified in the sense of that Dimension
[1:25:12] now this is all we know we come from God
[1:25:15] as a thought but I don't remember and
[1:25:17] neither do
[1:25:18] you so a holding place the six dimension
[1:25:23] for those
[1:25:24] souls and wouldn't you know it he made
[1:25:27] it in such a way that it would be
[1:25:29] something that they would even feel
[1:25:32] comfortable being
[1:25:34] around so it was Bluegrass and Rolling
[1:25:38] Hills and no doubt some streams and this
[1:25:42] and that and the other cuz they're not a
[1:25:43] disembodied spirit it's
[1:25:46] something that they would have felt at
[1:25:49] home with not streets of gold not
[1:25:52] palaces of of of gold and silver and you
[1:25:55] all the great foundations of the city
[1:25:57] with the apostles name he never
[1:25:58] mentioned nothing about sing that that's
[1:26:01] a little higher in the seventh Dimension
[1:26:04] but what was overwhelming was not the
[1:26:06] Landscapes it was not a beautiful the
[1:26:09] sky
[1:26:11] was Carol sister Sharon several years
[1:26:14] ago that overdosed her and some
[1:26:17] medication almost killed her she left
[1:26:21] her body
[1:26:23] in the hospital room she told her
[1:26:25] husband to tell Carol goodbye cuz they
[1:26:27] were so
[1:26:29] close and she left her body coming
[1:26:33] toward this light as she moves into that
[1:26:38] sphere the yellows she started seeing
[1:26:41] flowers the yellows and the blues and
[1:26:44] the oranges and the colors of what she
[1:26:48] saw she had never seen anything like it
[1:26:52] on
[1:26:53] Earth and her ability to view it and the
[1:26:56] light was brighter and brighter remember
[1:26:58] Isaiah prophesies that when the kingdom
[1:27:01] is reverted back the sun will be
[1:27:03] magnified seven times to what it is
[1:27:06] right now the sun lost an element of its
[1:27:09] Glory as did the moon as did the Stars
[1:27:13] when man fell so when the person moves
[1:27:17] into that realm Sharon was able to go
[1:27:20] and be gone for a bit and then come back
[1:27:22] she wrote it down actually told Carol
[1:27:25] about what she saw so it's a place that
[1:27:28] the Lord made for them to where they
[1:27:30] would be identified with something
[1:27:33] Earthly but yet Heavenly they couldn't
[1:27:37] identify with streets of gold they
[1:27:38] couldn't identify with Gates of pearl so
[1:27:40] it's a place that they're held but
[1:27:43] there's one thing that they will all
[1:27:45] have in common and that is they all had
[1:27:48] the Holy
[1:27:50] Ghost and the Holy Ghost was able to
[1:27:53] bring them to a
[1:27:54] state of
[1:27:58] maturity I received a letter from a
[1:28:00] brother in
[1:28:01] Belgium and they had certainly been a
[1:28:04] part of our church being bearing the
[1:28:07] burden for Eran praying for her and all
[1:28:10] and he told me of several people in his
[1:28:14] life that he had seeing them go and he
[1:28:18] felt prematurely one of them before he
[1:28:21] was even converted and he questioned God
[1:28:23] God why why why would you allow that man
[1:28:26] to go a young man and married and two
[1:28:28] small children why someone else in his
[1:28:31] life died the same question kept coming
[1:28:34] back why
[1:28:35] why happened for
[1:28:38] years and then there was a a particular
[1:28:41] person that had passed in his life and
[1:28:43] once again God why I don't understand
[1:28:51] why and the Lord spoke to him and
[1:28:54] said they so come into my
[1:28:58] image I wanted to bring them
[1:29:00] home was
[1:29:07] me my
[1:29:09] friends my sheep my children that have
[1:29:12] begotten to
[1:29:14] Christ I want to place before you today
[1:29:18] one of the view very
[1:29:20] few
[1:29:23] offers of
[1:29:25] perfection that you'll ever be
[1:29:28] given as your pastor I want to present
[1:29:31] to you today the offer of God's Own
[1:29:37] nature to where we can come into such an
[1:29:40] intensity of divine
[1:29:43] love that this world will not be able to
[1:29:46] hold us any
[1:29:48] longer and the temperance of love will
[1:29:51] grow
[1:29:52] and grow you believe whatever you wish
[1:29:55] to believe I personally believe that the
[1:29:57] elect of God reached that
[1:30:00] place before they ever go there are no
[1:30:04] supplemental classes or supplemental
[1:30:07] rooms that if you're lacking perfect
[1:30:10] love that when you leave here you're
[1:30:12] held in a Purgatory of sorts and then
[1:30:14] you grow into it you know the last few
[1:30:17] minutes before you go into the sixth
[1:30:20] Dimension you've actually
[1:30:24] arrived before you leave
[1:30:30] here I
[1:30:32] wonder if that's what it is about
[1:30:35] certain
[1:30:37] people that when we get around them we
[1:30:39] sense that something that's beyond them
[1:30:44] themselves and it makes us want to be
[1:30:46] like them I wonder if that's one by one
[1:30:49] as they're crossing
[1:30:50] over I wonder brother Joel if they're
[1:30:53] not attaining to that
[1:30:56] place and they need no supplemental
[1:30:58] character makeup they need no extra
[1:31:00] teaching on the other side you know
[1:31:02] there's a little a little forer there
[1:31:03] before the sixth Dimension and you get
[1:31:05] the last few things that you
[1:31:07] need when they leave here and they close
[1:31:10] their
[1:31:14] eyes
[1:31:17] hallelujah
[1:31:20] hallelujah so whatever you do lay aside
[1:31:23] everything else until you are just so
[1:31:26] filled with the love of God till you can
[1:31:30] love
[1:31:32] those who
[1:31:35] hate
[1:31:40] you how many needs help this
[1:31:46] morning till you can love
[1:31:49] those not say you do do but actually
[1:31:53] love
[1:31:55] them so lay aside
[1:31:58] everything notice in the Ephesian Church
[1:32:01] age in 1960 Ephesus was not a deceived
[1:32:06] Church it failed
[1:32:09] Itself by not
[1:32:12] continuing in perfect
[1:32:14] love so you mean this has existed in
[1:32:18] human beings
[1:32:20] before remember this was the alpha
[1:32:24] bride so the alpha bride in the Ephesian
[1:32:27] Church age remember whenever it was
[1:32:29] written here that the church AE the
[1:32:32] prophet dated it from around 53
[1:32:35] ad so that's when it
[1:32:38] began but yet we know the Holy Ghost
[1:32:40] fell in around 33 33 and A2
[1:32:45] ad so what were they those 20 years
[1:32:50] prior to the beginning of the church age
[1:32:54] what were they it was bride
[1:33:00] age for those of you that are looking
[1:33:02] for the bride age to be something
[1:33:04] different that's ever been you need to
[1:33:06] reread your church age book it's only a
[1:33:09] repeating of those years that existed
[1:33:12] before the church ages ever started he
[1:33:15] was their everything he was their head
[1:33:18] he was their love he was their Alpha
[1:33:20] their Omega their beginning their end
[1:33:22] they gave their life for him they loved
[1:33:24] him more than they loved anything else
[1:33:26] and then a coldness begin to come in and
[1:33:29] then the church age starts and then we
[1:33:32] see that God said because you have left
[1:33:35] your first love so what was it before
[1:33:37] that time it was bride time you know
[1:33:40] people want to take the bride age in
[1:33:42] this end time and say that it's a number
[1:33:44] eight Oh no you're wrong there's only
[1:33:47] seven but it's at the very end of
[1:33:51] theeven seventh Church age there will be
[1:33:53] a reoccurring again or the Omega bride
[1:33:57] will be Anointed with the same anointing
[1:33:59] that was on the alpha bride what's it
[1:34:01] going to be more signs more wonders they
[1:34:03] had all of that it's going to be a love
[1:34:05] restored also back in our hearts that
[1:34:08] we're going to love him more than we
[1:34:09] love life itself we're going to love him
[1:34:12] more than we love money more than we
[1:34:14] love things more than we love mama if
[1:34:17] necessary more than we love Daddy if
[1:34:19] necessary because we will be anointed
[1:34:22] the beginning will anoint the end and
[1:34:26] the end will point back to the beginning
[1:34:29] and the alpha will be again in the last
[1:34:32] day in the Omega remember the prophet in
[1:34:35] the vision saw the bride appear
[1:34:39] twice when he tells that in the
[1:34:41] Masterpiece he wasn't even sure about
[1:34:42] the interpretation but the Lord God gave
[1:34:45] him the interpretation when he preached
[1:34:47] the Masterpiece and said it just come
[1:34:49] clear to me he said if you notice the
[1:34:51] bride she commend you twice because she
[1:34:54] is Alpha and Omega and if we're not
[1:34:58] careful we will focus only on the
[1:35:00] Supernatural part of love I'll tell you
[1:35:02] one thing friends you cannot get any
[1:35:04] more of God than to get his own
[1:35:08] nature that's good think of it in heaven
[1:35:11] there'll be no healing in heaven there
[1:35:14] will be no
[1:35:16] Miracles so which will be the
[1:35:19] priority healing the L
[1:35:22] the blind the halt or love do you
[1:35:25] understand one day we'll never have any
[1:35:27] more prayer lines Brothers we will never
[1:35:29] lay hands on people again so laying
[1:35:32] hands on people is not
[1:35:35] Eternal having a prayer line is not
[1:35:38] Eternal but perfect love
[1:35:45] is Lord
[1:35:47] God John says here in is our love made
[1:35:50] perfect and that we may have boldness in
[1:35:52] the day of judgment listen to these
[1:35:56] words because as he
[1:36:00] is so are
[1:36:04] we in this present
[1:36:07] world now right now brother yes sir so
[1:36:11] as he is not are going to be in the
[1:36:14] sixth
[1:36:16] Dimension now what's John captured by
[1:36:20] perfect love
[1:36:22] can I have a few more
[1:36:26] minutes notice this I'd rather have a
[1:36:28] church listen just a moment I'd rather
[1:36:30] have a church that knows
[1:36:33] nothing about any spiritual
[1:36:36] gift just be so in love with each other
[1:36:39] and with Christ I'd rather have that
[1:36:42] than every spiritual gift operating in
[1:36:45] the
[1:36:47] church I realize there's an element of
[1:36:50] Brothers around the message
[1:36:51] that love to take this quote right here
[1:36:54] and try to say well bless God I'll tell
[1:36:56] you one thing the prophet said he'd
[1:36:58] rather have love than any of the gifts
[1:37:00] now what they're trying to do is take
[1:37:01] this one quote and make it seem as if
[1:37:04] though you don't need them but if they
[1:37:06] would have only read the latter part of
[1:37:08] the
[1:37:09] quote now that might be hard in a
[1:37:12] Pentecostal group but I would rather
[1:37:13] have it where there is gifts they'll
[1:37:17] fail where there is gifts they'll bring
[1:37:21] confusion Lord knows that's the truth
[1:37:24] where there is gifts they can be
[1:37:29] questioned but where there is
[1:37:32] love it is perfect now let's not stop
[1:37:35] before we read these last few
[1:37:38] lines and if you had perfect
[1:37:41] love you would
[1:37:44] have perfect
[1:37:49] gifts now you see that did R them the
[1:37:51] same way that they did Paul and Paul in
[1:37:54] Hebrews of course or 1 Corinthians
[1:37:56] rather chapter 11 he goes to talking
[1:37:57] about the body chapter 12 he goes to
[1:37:59] talking about the gifts and then Paul
[1:38:01] tells him now covet earnestly the best
[1:38:04] gifts and I'll show unto you a more
[1:38:06] excellent way and of course chapter 13
[1:38:09] but verse one he begins with faith hope
[1:38:12] and love charity all that you're
[1:38:14] familiar with it and then Brothers down
[1:38:16] through the centuries have done it they
[1:38:18] try to take chapter 133 and say as if
[1:38:21] though chapter 13 just knows and voids
[1:38:25] all the things that Paul said about the
[1:38:27] gifts why would he even took the time to
[1:38:30] write
[1:38:30] it Paul is not destroying the gifts but
[1:38:35] he's saying I'm showing you a more
[1:38:37] excellent way and the excellent way is
[1:38:39] if you get perfect love and then let God
[1:38:42] use you in the gifts these issues that I
[1:38:46] mentioned in chapter 12 will be taken
[1:38:48] care of because the more excellent way
[1:38:52] will be operated on Divine love and it
[1:38:55] will breed out gifts with margins of
[1:39:02] error oh my if you had perfect love
[1:39:06] you'd have perfect gifts so work first
[1:39:10] with love that brings fellowship and
[1:39:15] fellowship
[1:39:17] brings yes I know some of y'all were
[1:39:20] absolutely scared to death of gift I
[1:39:22] don't know why it's just as much God's
[1:39:24] word as any other word of God well come
[1:39:26] on why in the world would God ever put
[1:39:28] him in the Bible if he didn't want
[1:39:29] somebody to manifest him in a right
[1:39:31] brother Donnie I've seen so much false
[1:39:33] so have I but that don't change God's
[1:39:35] word I've seen a lot of false preachers
[1:39:37] too but I sure don't stop believing in
[1:39:39] them I've seen a lot of false sheep I've
[1:39:41] seen a lot you sure you have but that
[1:39:44] don't make me stop believe I still
[1:39:45] believe it's God's word
[1:39:48] amen 1 Corinthians 13:4 four now here's
[1:39:52] the excellent way
[1:39:55] charity suffers
[1:39:58] long and His
[1:40:00] Kind
[1:40:02] charity Envy us not charity vaun us not
[1:40:07] itself now watch this is the excellent
[1:40:10] way which produces perfect
[1:40:14] gifts so charity a man with Charity in
[1:40:18] his heart does not look at himself and
[1:40:20] feel somehow he's Superior to other
[1:40:26] brothers praise the
[1:40:29] Lord does not behave itself
[1:40:34] unseemly I find this so odd and
[1:40:38] peculiar that Paul would said seeketh
[1:40:41] not and he uses the feminist
[1:40:46] gender seeketh not her on
[1:40:52] I mean I thought it was talking about
[1:40:53] Divine love I thought we was talking
[1:40:54] about God we
[1:40:56] are you see the real people of God are
[1:41:00] his
[1:41:01] attributes no sin so charity doesn't
[1:41:04] behave itself unseemingly seeketh not
[1:41:07] her own is not easily
[1:41:10] provoked
[1:41:12] amen boy amen say like K's teeth this
[1:41:16] morning
[1:41:17] man seek is not or own is not easily
[1:41:21] provoked thinkest no evil rejoiceth not
[1:41:26] in iniquity so if you hear so and so who
[1:41:29] had said something bad about you how a
[1:41:31] car wre I knew God had get him
[1:41:34] back it's amazing how that works to me
[1:41:38] if you have a car wreck the devil's
[1:41:39] trying to kill you if somebody you don't
[1:41:42] like has one the Lord's getting back at
[1:41:45] them if you get the flu the devil's
[1:41:47] trying to kill you and then you got Co
[1:41:49] on top of oh that old devil and somebody
[1:41:51] else you don't like get it glory to God
[1:41:53] I pray God and deal with
[1:41:56] them I think we need to be careful in
[1:41:58] how we delegate all this
[1:42:01] stuff thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in
[1:42:06] iniquity but rejoices in the truth and
[1:42:09] if you notice Paul doesn't say part of
[1:42:11] it but it rejoices in the whole
[1:42:14] truth bow us all things believe us all
[1:42:19] things hope us all things endur us all
[1:42:25] things charity never
[1:42:28] fails but whether there be
[1:42:31] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[1:42:35] be tongues they shall cease whether
[1:42:38] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[1:42:41] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:42:44] part but when that which is perfect is
[1:42:46] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:42:50] done
[1:42:53] away it is your
[1:42:56] right to have
[1:42:59] perfect
[1:43:04] love not a put on not a
[1:43:09] show but to where every day hell is
[1:43:14] confounded by your
[1:43:17] action that Satan does everything he can
[1:43:21] to bring all these things against you
[1:43:22] now remember when you have perfect love
[1:43:24] all of these things you'll be Tried by
[1:43:27] so I want to warn you in
[1:43:29] advance this ain't for chickens and
[1:43:33] cowards it's for the
[1:43:38] elect so real love like this it doesn't
[1:43:42] mean you're a pushover now Jesus wasn't
[1:43:44] a pushover but he was able to pray for
[1:43:46] his enemies and love them not pray for
[1:43:49] him because the word tells him he had
[1:43:52] but pray for them with
[1:43:56] feeling praise the Lord you don't have
[1:43:59] to raise your hand on this if you don't
[1:44:00] want to but how many of you can pray for
[1:44:03] your enemies with
[1:44:07] feeling you have the same feeling for
[1:44:10] them that you do for your
[1:44:15] friends praise the
[1:44:18] lord well they treat me bad didn't speak
[1:44:21] to me over in a fellowship hall I'll get
[1:44:22] them back I won't speak to them your
[1:44:26] love ain't very
[1:44:27] intent yeah anger
[1:44:31] is if the prophet would have said thus
[1:44:33] sayith the Lord is going to take anger
[1:44:35] to walk down streets of go some of you
[1:44:37] would be shouting right now wouldn't you
[1:44:38] glory to God I'm got her made
[1:44:43] Hallelujah friends think of it we are
[1:44:46] talking about the
[1:44:48] introduction into a world
[1:44:51] the saints that have been going there
[1:44:53] now for some 2,000 years cuz remember
[1:44:55] they were never allowed to go there till
[1:44:57] after the cross so the cross purged man
[1:45:00] and brought him to a place where
[1:45:01] Paradise could be emptied out and shut
[1:45:05] down brought up into the to the next
[1:45:08] door to the seventh
[1:45:10] Dimension and what he saw was a mere
[1:45:13] glimpse of what heaven's going to be
[1:45:15] like heaven is going to be a world that
[1:45:19] might be surprising closer to this one
[1:45:21] than what you
[1:45:22] realize the prophet said it will be a
[1:45:25] continuation of this same life we will
[1:45:28] live we will eat we will drink we will
[1:45:33] Fellowship we will
[1:45:35] socialize
[1:45:37] amen I realize some folks they're
[1:45:42] antisocial you know they got about three
[1:45:44] or four friends and they don't want no
[1:45:46] more well I'll tell you one thing that
[1:45:47] ain't going to be the attitude in heaven
[1:45:50] well come on now some of y'all didn't
[1:45:51] like that did you well everybody there
[1:45:53] is going to love everybody else there
[1:45:56] and there won't be no little clicks you
[1:45:58] know you won't walk down Heaven Avenue
[1:46:00] in faith Boulevard and there'll be four
[1:46:02] or five little people
[1:46:05] just
[1:46:07] hi hi you can you always know when
[1:46:09] they're talking about you just by the
[1:46:10] look they got on their face you know and
[1:46:12] you know you've done called them and
[1:46:13] their FA is all rosy red and you know
[1:46:16] that you've done color there'll never be
[1:46:17] none of that there nobody will ever be
[1:46:20] SI D can you imagine them when the
[1:46:22] saints of God leave this world and they
[1:46:24] go by seed life into the theophany of
[1:46:27] God and they burst into that body they
[1:46:30] get their first
[1:46:32] glimpse of the Holy
[1:46:35] Ghost and it's
[1:46:37] perfection in a
[1:46:40] theophany because I was able to attain
[1:46:43] to it in a human body but the human body
[1:46:46] is so veiled its attributes from
[1:46:49] them I wonder if there's ever been a one
[1:46:51] of them with the Holy Ghost that crossed
[1:46:53] over these 2,000 years that said glory
[1:46:56] to God I've got perfect love Hallelujah
[1:46:58] I've got this and that and the other I
[1:47:00] wonder in reality how many of them
[1:47:02] thought oh I hope everything's okay oh
[1:47:05] God I need more God I need more Lord I
[1:47:07] want more oh Jesus help me help me help
[1:47:10] me Lord I Want More why could they say
[1:47:13] that because that Holy Ghost was still
[1:47:17] failed in this
[1:47:21] so all God does is take your
[1:47:23] jean and your portion of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:27] out of this
[1:47:29] coat this is what the prophet preached
[1:47:31] this body was and things that are to be
[1:47:34] an old
[1:47:35] coat so God takes your holy ghost out of
[1:47:39] the coat and your SE genene when the
[1:47:42] last breath is
[1:47:45] drawn that and your sophony meet
[1:47:48] together your SE gen and your portion of
[1:47:51] the Holy Ghost you imagine walking into
[1:47:56] yourself when you just step into
[1:48:00] yourself you stepped out of a coach here
[1:48:04] and you step into a new one
[1:48:06] there and all of a sudden your Holy
[1:48:09] Ghost and your C Gene looks with
[1:48:14] eyes that it's never seen through before
[1:48:17] with flesh that it's never seen before
[1:48:20] and it looks at itself and
[1:48:23] realizes I've
[1:48:26] arrived thank
[1:48:29] God I've arrived
[1:48:37] amen SP
[1:48:47] yet Hallelujah
[1:48:56] Lord
[1:49:04] Jesus I'd like for each of us from the
[1:49:06] front to the back up in the sound
[1:49:09] booths wherever you are
[1:49:11] today streaming at home maybe you can't
[1:49:15] couldn't be here today because of
[1:49:16] sickness or
[1:49:18] whatever may the Lord just help each
[1:49:20] other of
[1:49:21] us but we can look at
[1:49:25] ourself I don't want you to compare
[1:49:27] yourself to the Le of seeds because even
[1:49:30] a cold message believer looks better
[1:49:32] than they do but I want you to compare
[1:49:35] yourself to the mirror in the mirror of
[1:49:38] God's
[1:49:41] word so how do you treat those who have
[1:49:44] done you great damage and
[1:49:48] wrong is there anybody body you would
[1:49:51] want to
[1:49:52] see
[1:49:54] lost is there any
[1:49:57] mortal that you would want to see them
[1:50:03] perish is there anyone who is your
[1:50:05] friend or has been your
[1:50:07] friend and you honestly wish they would
[1:50:09] just die and get out of your
[1:50:14] face then my friend you need a greater
[1:50:17] Temperance of
[1:50:19] love
[1:50:22] and if you say you believe this message
[1:50:24] with all of your
[1:50:27] heart then I want to challenge you
[1:50:31] today with all of your doings with all
[1:50:33] of your seekings of this and that and
[1:50:35] the
[1:50:37] other seek this Temperance of love in
[1:50:41] your
[1:50:44] heart because you can't put this
[1:50:48] on I've set by the bedside side of
[1:50:51] many when they were fixing the
[1:50:55] crossover when you come to face and
[1:50:58] death you can't put it
[1:51:01] on you can't act it because you're
[1:51:04] coming face to face with the
[1:51:06] reality even for those that are
[1:51:09] lost Prophet tells us about the woman
[1:51:11] that all those years she believed she's
[1:51:14] okay until death struck
[1:51:17] her then her conscience are subconscious
[1:51:21] all of that come back to the reality and
[1:51:24] she said I'm
[1:51:27] lost and she looked to that
[1:51:30] Pastor which had preached to her
[1:51:34] lies and in her last dying moments she
[1:51:38] said you
[1:51:42] hypocrite I'll never forget I was told a
[1:51:44] Dream by someone years
[1:51:47] ago they dreamed about the regions of
[1:51:49] the the
[1:51:51] lost and they saw millions of people
[1:51:54] there screaming hollering
[1:51:57] crying and they saw this individual
[1:52:00] going into the regions of the lost
[1:52:03] and taking a hold of men by their lapel
[1:52:07] or their shirt type thing pulling them
[1:52:12] up looking at them and then throwing
[1:52:14] them back down Pull up another one throw
[1:52:16] them back down Pull up another
[1:52:18] one and in the dream the person
[1:52:22] asked someone standing by them what are
[1:52:24] they looking for what are they looking
[1:52:28] for The Voice answered back and said
[1:52:31] they're looking for that
[1:52:33] preacher that damned their soul to
[1:52:36] Hell by false
[1:52:41] Doctrine beyond the curtain of time they
[1:52:44] were looking for the prophet of God
[1:52:46] which had come to bring a message I
[1:52:48] don't know how you feel today but I love
[1:52:50] this message more than I ever have in my
[1:52:53] entire life I ain't tired of it I ain't
[1:52:56] sick of it I know a lot of folks are
[1:52:58] they're tired of it they're tired of
[1:52:59] hearing it preached well go right ahead
[1:53:02] but for me I love it more than I've ever
[1:53:05] loved it it's answering more questions
[1:53:08] than ever before for
[1:53:11] me I'm going to tell you one thing if
[1:53:13] you go to hell you can look all over
[1:53:17] hell but you ain't going to find me
[1:53:19] there
[1:53:21] cuz I ain't going to be there first of
[1:53:22] all and I am not going to preach you
[1:53:26] damnable lean Doctrine that'll damn your
[1:53:30] soul to the regions of the lost you may
[1:53:33] get mad at me sometime but I'm want to
[1:53:35] tell you the
[1:53:38] truth that the kind of man of God we
[1:53:40] want
[1:53:42] yes but what I want to ask you now is
[1:53:45] this how many of us all of us can we say
[1:53:49] Lord
[1:53:50] I need a greater Temperance of love I do
[1:53:53] I see it Jesus I do Lord I have a hard
[1:53:58] time with certain people Lord I've just
[1:53:59] got to be honest just be honest with him
[1:54:01] friends he knows anyway you can just be
[1:54:04] honest with him he honors our
[1:54:08] honesty praise the
[1:54:11] Lord praise the
[1:54:15] Lord hallelujah
[1:54:18] hallelujah
[1:54:21] thank you Lord
[1:54:25] God thank you Lord
[1:54:27] Jesus heavenly father as we have our
[1:54:30] heads
[1:54:31] bowed I have my hands raised up today
[1:54:36] Jesus I need a greater
[1:54:39] degree of Your Love
[1:54:42] Lord I believe I have the Holy Ghost I
[1:54:45] believe I have your love in my soul
[1:54:50] I want it in a greater intensity
[1:54:54] lord it's sort of like a man and a woman
[1:54:56] and they meet and they
[1:54:59] start liking each other and the more
[1:55:01] they're with each other the more they
[1:55:03] feel for each other and then them
[1:55:05] feelings change from like into the first
[1:55:09] stages of love and then they love each
[1:55:12] other and then they decide they want to
[1:55:14] get married and they love each other the
[1:55:16] first year the second year on and on and
[1:55:18] on and they think I could never love her
[1:55:22] anymore but here Carol and I have been
[1:55:24] married for 50
[1:55:25] years and I love her today more than I
[1:55:29] did that day we got married 50 years
[1:55:35] ago it's a deeper intensity of
[1:55:39] love I love you Lord
[1:55:41] Jesus more than I've ever loved you but
[1:55:45] I want to love you so
[1:55:47] much that your love will will reflect
[1:55:50] itself back out of
[1:55:54] me it's amazing to me men Carol will go
[1:55:57] into the store somewhere she'll be
[1:55:59] shopping looking for a dress for the
[1:56:01] girls or maybe something for our our
[1:56:03] daughter or for
[1:56:05] herself it happened
[1:56:08] yesterday she picked up a certain
[1:56:11] sweater I was down the
[1:56:13] rack maybe 8 or 10 feet from her I
[1:56:17] picked up the exact same one
[1:56:21] because we're thinking
[1:56:25] alike no doubt Lord your sons and your
[1:56:29] daughters before they get ready to leave
[1:56:32] this world they're getting closer and
[1:56:36] closer and closer to
[1:56:39] you and you just say you're so much like
[1:56:42] me I want to take you
[1:56:46] home but you know the sadness it leaves
[1:56:48] in our hearts
[1:56:51] so I pray you'd help those of us that
[1:56:53] are left behind Lord
[1:56:56] God father I desire more than anything
[1:56:59] in this
[1:57:00] world I don't want to be rich famous
[1:57:05] important I Want Your
[1:57:08] Love
[1:57:10] perfect
[1:57:12] love I've had people to lie on me I've
[1:57:14] had people to run me down all that sort
[1:57:17] of thing God but help me that I'll never
[1:57:20] have an attitude that I can always be
[1:57:23] like
[1:57:24] you and say father forgive them for they
[1:57:28] don't know what they're
[1:57:30] doing I don't want to do that because
[1:57:32] it's a scripture to quote I want to do
[1:57:34] it because the pulsation is so real from
[1:57:37] my soul I can feel it as if it was
[1:57:41] you because in
[1:57:44] reality it is
[1:57:46] you it's you and us
[1:57:50] fulfilling your
[1:57:52] word thank you Lord
[1:57:55] God can we stand our
[1:58:01] feet thank you Lord
[1:58:05] God thank you Lord
[1:58:09] God you see perfect love will anoint
[1:58:12] every
[1:58:13] heart so say some are given the gift of
[1:58:16] faith some are given the gift of tongues
[1:58:18] some would be given whatever types of
[1:58:21] gifts at what God would want to give
[1:58:23] them it would never be about themsel it
[1:58:26] would never be about people following
[1:58:28] them and them using the gift to try to
[1:58:31] get people to follow
[1:58:32] them but it would be about them trying
[1:58:36] to help with no selfish motive
[1:58:38] whatsoever in
[1:58:41] mind wouldn't that be an awesome church
[1:58:44] yes wouldn't that be an awesome church
[1:58:46] to be a part
[1:58:48] of I hope I live to see
[1:58:52] it I've seen gifts with
[1:58:55] mistakes preachers with great gifts to
[1:58:59] preach but yet you get around them and
[1:59:01] it's me and mine and I and me and this
[1:59:05] and that I get so sick of hearing that
[1:59:08] stuff and you just think
[1:59:11] Lord help us that we can lay
[1:59:14] aside all that we
[1:59:16] are and let perfect love
[1:59:20] okay so we're talking about Christmas
[1:59:22] time people buying gifts wanting
[1:59:26] gifts so brother Donnie what do you want
[1:59:28] for Christmas I just preached it to you

[1:59:39] whatever other day there

[1:59:44] difference how many people I pray for
[1:59:46] and God does
[1:59:48] miracles
[1:59:50] don't just get in your mind that I've
[1:59:51] had the supernatural in the last last
[1:59:53] eight or 10 years I've had the
[1:59:54] supernatural my Ministry ever since God
[1:59:56] called me to preach I've always had it
[1:59:59] I've seen phenomenal Miracles you
[2:00:01] wouldn't even believe if I told
[2:00:03] you that's
[2:00:06] wonderful do you understand AA Allen had
[2:00:08] such Miracles that was unbelievable
[2:00:12] Miracles Jack Co had them you you need
[2:00:14] to wake up a little bit and realize
[2:00:16] brother Brenham when the only one was
[2:00:18] Miracles right
[2:00:20] only one in time he said here we are
[2:00:22] with the anointed word and he said
[2:00:23] another man over there a trinitarian
[2:00:25] with the same Miracles and signs a
[2:00:28] Allen the lame would walk the blind
[2:00:31] would see the dumb would sing they had
[2:00:33] all kinds of
[2:00:35] stuff and a
[2:00:37] trinitarian we're not known by our signs
[2:00:41] alone but
[2:00:43] love they say John got so
[2:00:46] old Liv to be in his n
[2:00:50] he couldn't preach no more so they just
[2:00:52] pack him to church in a little stretcher
[2:00:55] type thing and he just rais up his hands
[2:00:57] and say love one another little
[2:01:01] children love one
[2:01:04] another love one another little
[2:01:10] children no wonder they called him the
[2:01:14] disciple of
[2:01:17] Love Brother John Michael wouldn't that
[2:01:19] be an awesome thing for you to be
[2:01:22] called a disciple of
[2:01:25] love what about a sis wouldn't that be
[2:01:28] awesome what about it young men wouldn't
[2:01:31] that be awesome to be called a
[2:01:34] disciple of love I talking about this
[2:01:37] ooey gooey stuff where you compromise
[2:01:39] I'm talking about you never compromise
[2:01:41] one word word but you love those that
[2:01:45] don't even believe what you tell
[2:01:48] them let's lay your hands on each other
[2:01:50] this morning if you
[2:01:54] would you're not praying for yourself
[2:01:59] now friends you understand this moment
[2:02:02] is between life and
[2:02:04] death how many people have embraced the
[2:02:06] knowledge of this message and will miss
[2:02:08] the
[2:02:09] Rapture I always say I feel so sorry for
[2:02:11] those that the first service after the
[2:02:14] Rapture takes place on the earth and
[2:02:16] there will be people that'll gather and
[2:02:18] message churches
[2:02:20] and the sad part about it is some of the
[2:02:21] pastors will show
[2:02:22] up because even though they say they
[2:02:25] preach the message their emphasis was
[2:02:27] selfish their emphasis was not on the
[2:02:30] full word but the Conant got Sidelines
[2:02:33] from one hangup to
[2:02:35] another oh children children if the
[2:02:39] Rapture takes place tomorrow Tuesday I
[2:02:42] hope and pray to God there ain't a one
[2:02:43] of you shows up for church on Wednesday
[2:02:46] night I hope every one of us are gone
[2:02:54] dear Jesus I began with me
[2:02:57] today search
[2:02:59] me help
[2:03:01] me is there anyone
[2:03:04] Lord that I would want to see
[2:03:08] lost is there anyone that I would
[2:03:11] want to not be allowed to go into heaven
[2:03:14] because I have some attitude toward
[2:03:17] them
[2:03:20] well some people wouldn't even want
[2:03:21] certain people to come here to our
[2:03:23] church because they have too big of a
[2:03:25] problem with
[2:03:27] them I don't know how in world they're
[2:03:29] ever going to go to heaven
[2:03:32] together I pray God should help
[2:03:36] us you come to seek and to save that
[2:03:39] which was
[2:03:41] lost Lord and if we have anyone that we
[2:03:44] would want to see lost let me show them
[2:03:48] how contrary that is to your nature for
[2:03:50] your word says it is not your will that
[2:03:55] any should
[2:03:58] perish so if we want anyone man woman
[2:04:01] boy or girl no matter how awful they've
[2:04:03] treated us if we would want anyone to be
[2:04:08] lost we are missing your
[2:04:12] will help me
[2:04:16] Jesus help me Jesus
[2:04:20] Lord God I've laid my hands on people in
[2:04:23] the middle of a heart attack right here
[2:04:25] at the med
[2:04:26] center and I've watched you stop
[2:04:29] it I've laid my hands on people with
[2:04:32] cancer laid my hands on people with
[2:04:35] cross
[2:04:36] eyes and watch you straighten them
[2:04:39] out I've seen so many signs wonders and
[2:04:43] miracles I thank you for every one of
[2:04:45] them but today I'm not asking you for a
[2:04:50] son not asking you for
[2:04:53] someone's eyes to be
[2:04:55] opened but I'm asking you take
[2:04:58] me and take these people into a deeper
[2:05:03] place of
[2:05:05] love than we've ever been
[2:05:09] before Hallelujah Lord
[2:05:13] Jesus baptize us so in the love of
[2:05:16] God oh Lord
[2:05:19] Jesus how can we say we're getting close
[2:05:22] to the change and can't even speak to
[2:05:24] one another how can we say we're getting
[2:05:27] close to being Rapture Ready and have
[2:05:30] alt in our hearts one against the
[2:05:33] other how can
[2:05:35] we help us
[2:05:38] Lord May the love of God May a baptism
[2:05:42] of the love of
[2:05:44] God so fall in our
[2:05:47] church
[2:05:49] oh we've got people screaming for
[2:05:51] Revival people praying for Revival some
[2:05:54] saying the Revival is going to be gifts
[2:05:56] some saying the Revival is going to be
[2:05:58] this Revelation that
[2:06:00] Revelation Lord God May our
[2:06:03] Revival be a Revival of
[2:06:07] Love of a love so deep for you and so
[2:06:11] deep for one another that if we get
[2:06:14] perfect love we'll have perfect gifts
[2:06:17] but if we seek the gift without the
[2:06:20] proper Foundation we will get a gift
[2:06:23] with a margin of error in it and then
[2:06:26] when we're caught wrong we'll make
[2:06:28] excuse and won't admit that we missed
[2:06:32] it I hear of tongues and interpretation
[2:06:35] that are going on and I find it so
[2:06:37] astounding that preachers want to spend
[2:06:39] all the time studying about the gifts
[2:06:41] using the message to prove that we need
[2:06:43] the gifts but then they won't use the
[2:06:46] same
[2:06:47] message to show how the prophet taught
[2:06:50] they should be
[2:06:51] operated stand up and speak in tongues
[2:06:53] and prophesying yeah the Lord say I'm
[2:06:56] here and I'm coming when the prophet
[2:06:58] said it should be something directly to
[2:07:00] an
[2:07:02] individual NE we believe what he said or
[2:07:06] we don't I choose to believe what he
[2:07:09] said amen I don't believe you're going
[2:07:10] to stand and repeat scripture what is it
[2:07:13] gifts or the margin of
[2:07:16] error out of the hearts of who sincere
[2:07:19] people that want a move of God but we're
[2:07:21] seeking the gifts without perfect love
[2:07:25] and if we can get that
[2:07:27] Foundation then the gifts that do come
[2:07:29] there won't be no Miss there won't be no
[2:07:32] wrong here well I guess I missed it I
[2:07:34] guess I was wrong there it'll produce
[2:07:36] Perfection amen praise be to
[2:07:40] God oh Jesus baptized Word of Life
[2:07:46] Church with such a refreshing of the
[2:07:50] Holy Ghost l oh it'll be awesome if we
[2:07:53] run it'll be awesome if we
[2:07:56] shout but Lord God what will even be
[2:07:59] more awesome than all of that is that we
[2:08:01] will come out of our baptism staggering
[2:08:04] under the power of God and find a depth
[2:08:07] of the love of God that we have only
[2:08:09] read about thank you Lord we will find
[2:08:12] ourselves living a
[2:08:14] life of
[2:08:17] deity
[2:08:19] hallelujah
[2:08:21] hallelujah We Worship You
[2:08:25] Jesus how many wants that with all your
[2:08:29] heart here sing something for us let's
[2:08:31] just worship together
[2:08:33] now oh children do you really want it
[2:08:36] yeah would you rather have just signs
[2:08:38] and wonders and miracles do you
[2:08:41] understand there'll never be one person
[2:08:43] lost never one person
[2:08:46] lost that has ever experienced
[2:08:49] perfect
[2:08:50] love there'll be those that have jumped
[2:08:52] and shouted and healed the sick and
[2:08:53] raised the dead and cast out devils and
[2:08:55] all that that will be lost but there'll
[2:08:57] never be one
[2:09:00] lost that's ever moved into this realm
[2:09:03] when you get here what did they tell the
[2:09:06] prophet when they said one to another
[2:09:08] when he got there when one person looked
[2:09:11] to the other and said think of it he's
[2:09:17] arrived he's
[2:09:19] arrived wouldn't it be awesome if that
[2:09:22] could be said about us after this
[2:09:24] service
[2:09:25] today some of you may not be that far
[2:09:29] away from perfect mature
[2:09:36] love till you finally enter that last
[2:09:40] stage and you're there remember there
[2:09:43] was some Believers in the first church
[2:09:44] age that had it they had it John was
[2:09:49] writing to some that had
[2:09:51] it perfect
[2:09:55] love thank
[2:09:58] God thank
[2:10:00] god let's worship a little
[2:10:03] bit got a little brother Nehemiah that
[2:10:07] wants to be baptized
[2:10:09] today if you'll come and we'll prepare
[2:10:12] for that let's just spend a little time
[2:10:15] in the presence of the Lord let him take
[2:10:19] his great MRI and his CT as it were look
[2:10:23] down in your
[2:10:25] soul let him give the report back of
[2:10:29] what he
[2:10:31] found you need more of me and less of
[2:10:34] you no no your love is not mature yet
[2:10:37] you're still really
[2:10:39] selfish you'll never tell nobody not
[2:10:41] even the pastor but you've got a problem
[2:10:43] if people clap more for somebody when
[2:10:45] they sing than they do for you
[2:10:48] you're a preacher and you've got a
[2:10:50] problem because you don't have as many
[2:10:52] open
[2:10:53] doors that's what this other man does
[2:10:56] brother Donnie you mean preachers tell
[2:10:57] you that
[2:11:00] yes I had one to come to me not long
[2:11:04] ago you know him well I won't mention
[2:11:07] his name but to tell me I have a problem
[2:11:10] with so and so and so and so and so and
[2:11:12] so because they get to preach more than
[2:11:15] I
[2:11:15] do they've got more doors than I do
[2:11:19] more people call him than I
[2:11:21] do you know what I realized the problem
[2:11:24] was the lack of
[2:11:25] doors was a lack of love oh
[2:11:29] yeah so if a preacher will build his
[2:11:32] ministry on perfect love and he may
[2:11:35] preach to 50 and you do believe it
[2:11:38] however you want to I admire men of God
[2:11:41] that have a small Church you realize
[2:11:44] there's men of God that will never in
[2:11:45] their entire Ministry preach to a
[2:11:47] Congregation of this this SI here this
[2:11:49] morning preach to 25 or 30 and they're
[2:11:52] as faithful to God as they can be oh
[2:11:55] they ain't nothing they are something
[2:11:57] too they're men of God and they many of
[2:12:00] will never be invited to preach a
[2:12:01] convention never stand before 5,000
[2:12:04] people as I've been privileged to that
[2:12:07] don't mean they're a nobody that don't
[2:12:09] mean they're not important to God oh
[2:12:11] everybody needs to move away from them
[2:12:13] little churches and move to mega
[2:12:14] churches what are we talking about
[2:12:16] that's the way the world Saints God may
[2:12:19] have placed them there in that little
[2:12:21] church to be a light in their Community
[2:12:24] everybody ain't supposed to move to Word
[2:12:25] of Life Church everybody a't supposed to
[2:12:28] move to brother Tim PR or brother Ron
[2:12:30] Peterson or brother Ron Spencers they're
[2:12:32] supposed to be where God wants them to
[2:12:34] be and if God wants them to be there in
[2:12:36] that little church then let them stay in
[2:12:38] that little church we're not going to
[2:12:40] proelite
[2:12:43] nobody
