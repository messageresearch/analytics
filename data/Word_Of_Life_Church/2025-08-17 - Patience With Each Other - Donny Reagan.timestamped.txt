[19:48] All rise, please.
[20:27] [Music]
[20:35] You may be seated.
[20:43] family and friends are gathered here
[20:45] together in the sight of God in the face
[20:47] of this company to join together this
[20:49] man and this woman to enter into the
[20:52] holy state of matrimony
[20:55] which is commanded in the scriptures to
[20:57] be entered into reverently discreetly
[21:00] and in the fear of God. These two
[21:03] persons present today have come to be
[21:06] joined together not only just in vows
[21:09] but in commitment and in covenant and in
[21:13] love. Who gives this woman to be married
[21:15] to this man?
[21:43] [Music]
[21:45] One look at you,
[21:50] my whole life falls in line.
[21:58] I prayed for you
[22:03] before I called you mine.
[22:12] Oh, I can't believe it's true sometimes.
[22:21] Oh, I can't believe
[22:25] it's true.
[22:29] I get to love you.
[22:34] It's the best thing that I'll ever do. I
[22:39] get to love you.
[22:43] It's a promise I'm making to you.
[22:47] Whatever may come, your heart I will
[22:51] choose. Forever I'm yours. Forever I do.
[22:59] I get to love you.
[23:04] I get to love you.
[23:13] The way you love
[23:17] it changes
[23:20] who I am.
[23:25] I am undone
[23:29] and I thank God once again.
[23:39] Oh, I can't believe
[23:43] it's true
[23:45] sometimes.
[23:48] No, I
[23:50] can't believe
[23:52] it's true.
[23:56] I get to love you.
[24:01] It's the best thing that I'll ever do. I
[24:06] get to love you.
[24:11] It's a promise I'm making to you.
[24:15] Whatever may come, your heart I will
[24:18] choose. Forever I'm yours. Forever I do.
[24:26] I get to love you.
[24:31] I get to love you.
[24:36] I get to love you.
[24:40] I get to love you.
[24:48] And they say love is a journey.
[24:52] I promise that I'll never leave.
[24:56] And when it's too heavy to car,
[25:01] remember this moment with me.
[25:08] I get to love you.
[25:13] I get to love you.
[25:18] I get to love
[25:21] you.
[25:27] [Music]
[25:34] I wonder today if we would ask the
[25:36] meaning of love
[25:40] to different cultures in the world, to
[25:42] different people of the world.
[25:45] Probably every answer would be somewhat
[25:48] unique from one individual to the other
[25:51] depending on what they were taught that
[25:54] love really was.
[25:57] When the first couple stood in the
[25:59] Garden of Eden and the love that they
[26:01] had and experienced for each other,
[26:05] I dare say that there was very few
[26:08] people in the Old Testament after that
[26:10] fall that ever experienced that type of
[26:14] love again. As a matter of fact, many of
[26:17] the marriages in the Old Testament among
[26:19] the cultures of the people for thousands
[26:23] of years, love had a very small
[26:26] relevance in the union itself. It was
[26:30] more about what it could accomplish and
[26:32] what it could benefit the parents and
[26:34] business and transactions.
[26:37] You may love your husband or your wife
[26:40] or you may not.
[26:42] But you see, the Lord Jesus when he come
[26:44] to the earth, he didn't just come to
[26:46] redeem us from sin, but he came to
[26:49] restore
[26:51] love again.
[26:52] So since his coming to the earth and
[26:56] people being able to be born of his
[26:59] life, it restored a love that a man and
[27:03] a woman could have for each other that
[27:06] hasn't been anything quite like it since
[27:09] the Garden of Eden.
[27:12] So when we see a man and woman that are
[27:14] born of the spirit of God and they fall
[27:17] in love with each other,
[27:19] they have something working between them
[27:22] that is a restoration
[27:24] of what Adam and Eve experienced for a
[27:28] short time and then it was lost. There's
[27:32] a few characters in the Bible, Song of
[27:34] Solomon just speaks one, Ruth another.
[27:37] There's a few that we can read about
[27:39] them and their love was so outstanding
[27:42] and that's the reason it was outstanding
[27:45] because it was not common. For those of
[27:48] us today that are Christians and filled
[27:50] with the spirit of God and we have our
[27:53] wives, our husbands, we don't realize
[27:56] how grateful that we should be to know
[27:59] the love that we experience when we look
[28:02] them in the face and the eyes that we're
[28:05] experiencing the same type of thing that
[28:08] was on the original son and daughter of
[28:11] God.
[28:13] When we think of love,
[28:15] many people look at love and it's all
[28:17] about what love can do for them.
[28:20] Marriage is. So when a young man will
[28:23] look for a woman, he said, "Well, I like
[28:24] this and I like that. I like that and
[28:27] she'll do me good this way and that way
[28:29] and the young lady many times does
[28:32] exactly the same."
[28:34] But whenever we look at real love, real
[28:37] love is sacrificial love. So whenever a
[28:42] man finds a woman that he loves with all
[28:45] of his heart, and when it comes right
[28:47] down to it, he can't actually point his
[28:49] finger to it's the size of her fingers.
[28:52] They're so small. Oh, I just love the
[28:55] size of her fingers. Or it's how tall
[28:57] she is. There'll be all kinds of things
[29:00] that he could identify, but when it
[29:03] comes down to it, he cannot really tell
[29:06] you the one thing that it is. Neither
[29:09] can she. if it's true love because we're
[29:13] using finite descriptions the way we
[29:16] would describe the way we feel. But true
[29:19] love, the love of God is not just
[29:22] emotional love and it's not just sexual
[29:25] love, but it's a love that is even
[29:28] beyond that.
[29:30] And it's very sad in the day that we
[29:32] live in when over 50% of our marriages
[29:36] wind up in divorce in our nation. And we
[29:39] can see why because many of them do not
[29:42] have the restored love to be able to
[29:46] love their husband or wife in that way.
[29:50] Love is a self-giving love patterned
[29:54] after the cross. Paul does not define
[29:58] love as a rush of romantic hormones.
[30:01] Instead, love is the sacrifice
[30:04] of yourself
[30:06] for your beloved.
[30:08] It is a decision to nail your
[30:11] selfishness
[30:13] to the cross
[30:16] while giving your love to the one person
[30:19] you love the most in the earth. It is a
[30:23] decision to give up your selfishness for
[30:26] the sake of the one you love. This is
[30:29] the kind of love we trust this young man
[30:32] and this young woman will love each
[30:34] other with. You should love each other
[30:36] not because he or she gives you pleasure
[30:39] but because you want to give yourself up
[30:43] to each other. And see this is the real
[30:46] secret of the love of God. For God so
[30:49] loved the world that he gave his only
[30:51] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[30:53] him should not perish but have
[30:55] everlasting life. For God sent not his
[30:57] son into the world to condemn the world
[31:00] but that the world through him might be
[31:02] saved. So, it wasn't just about what can
[31:05] you all do for me? If I die for you,
[31:08] what will you all give me? Will you all
[31:11] live for me? Will you serve me? That had
[31:14] nothing to do with the equation. God so
[31:17] loved that he gave.
[31:20] Then it's up to us whether we receive
[31:22] that love or not. You can imagine then a
[31:25] man and a woman that love each other
[31:27] with that kind of love.
[31:29] they have a great advantage over the
[31:31] average person that just falls in love
[31:33] with somebody because of looks or lust
[31:35] or money or whatever else it is.
[31:40] Love is giving yourself up for each
[31:42] other. That is how Christ loved the
[31:44] church and that is how you need to love
[31:47] each other. And I suggest to you today
[31:50] that this unconditional love is a
[31:51] healthy model for every godly marriage.
[31:55] While it is right to long for your
[31:57] spouse to change and right now they love
[32:00] each other so much they think it don't
[32:02] even matter. But as they are with each
[32:05] other for a while he'll begin to say
[32:08] things about her and he may already have
[32:09] but he just hasn't told her yet. And
[32:12] she'll see things about him and she'll
[32:14] think I wish he didn't do that. I wish
[32:16] he'd pick up his clothes. I wish he
[32:19] wouldn't kick his shoes off by the door.
[32:21] And but you see real true love is
[32:25] actually an unconditional love.
[32:29] And as we fall in love with a person, we
[32:32] can also fall out of love with that
[32:34] person. If it's conditional love because
[32:37] the conditions were right for us to fall
[32:40] in love with them. When the conditions
[32:42] change, we no longer feel the same way.
[32:45] And what's so sad is to see two people
[32:48] living together by law. They're married.
[32:50] By God's covenant, they're married, but
[32:52] yet they no longer love each other. But
[32:55] if this couple can base it upon that,
[32:57] they'll have something that'll keep them
[32:59] for the rest of their life.
[33:01] Secondly, love is forgiving.
[33:05] And we can see this not only just by the
[33:07] first man and woman that was in the
[33:09] Garden of Eden because it's evident that
[33:11] Adam lost something that he had in those
[33:13] first few months or years, however long
[33:16] it was because he loved her so much he
[33:19] was willing to forfeit his kingdom for
[33:21] her. And once that holy image of God
[33:24] left him, he turns right around and
[33:27] blames God, the woman you gave me. So
[33:34] something left him. Something left him.
[33:38] That godly image. And that woman that he
[33:40] forfeited his godship for cuz that's
[33:43] what he was a god of the earth. And now
[33:47] that that left him, he blames God and he
[33:51] blames the wife. Why? Adam had lost this
[33:55] type of love.
[33:58] What will make a marriage last is the
[34:00] willingness to seek forgiveness
[34:04] and to forgive. That's why in the Bible
[34:07] Paul talks about love keeps no records.
[34:12] Do you good to read that in 1
[34:13] Corinthians 13 sometimes love doesn't
[34:16] keep a tally. It doesn't keep a note on
[34:19] your iPhone or your Droid of how many
[34:22] times your husband or your wife or your
[34:24] friend or whoever it is has offended you
[34:27] or trespassed against you. Love keeps no
[34:31] records. You see, if real divine love
[34:34] kept records, there will be no one
[34:36] saved, absolutely no one at the white
[34:41] throne judgment. Because all of us have
[34:44] so much against us in God's sight,
[34:49] there's no help for any of us if love
[34:52] keeps a record. But you see, forgiveness
[34:55] involves more than just, okay, okay, I I
[34:57] forgive you this time. But then the next
[34:59] time you bring it up again and again and
[35:02] again.
[35:04] It's easy to keep a record of wrongs if
[35:06] you're not careful to keep a chart, a
[35:08] list, a running tally of all the times
[35:12] you've been hurt or offended.
[35:14] Forgive
[35:16] because that's what Jesus does.
[35:19] Find your ways of resolving your
[35:21] conflicts and forgiving each other and
[35:25] then enjoy the making up.
[35:28] What does it mean to forgive? Again, the
[35:30] meanings would vary as many several
[35:32] hundred people here today. This is quite
[35:35] a simple meaning that I think defines it
[35:38] well. It means to set the other person
[35:42] free
[35:46] by absorbing the pain
[35:49] into yourself
[35:52] that rightly should be theirs.
[35:55] Listen to me again.
[35:58] Forgiveness means to set the other
[36:00] person free
[36:02] by absorbing the pain into yourself that
[36:07] rightly should be theirs. You say, "How
[36:09] can you say that?" Because that's what
[36:12] he done for all of us. You see, he
[36:16] forgave us
[36:19] our wrong and all of our guilt and all
[36:21] of our pain. It should have been hours
[36:23] to bear. But he said, "I forgive you so
[36:27] much. I'll take that to me and I will
[36:32] release you."
[36:36] You know, the scripture tells us not to
[36:37] let the sun go down upon a wrath. And I
[36:40] think that's a good advice for married
[36:42] couples as well.
[36:45] We'll proceed to the wedding vow so
[36:47] everybody can relax now. Okay.
[36:51] I require and charge you both as you
[36:53] will answer at the day of judgment when
[36:54] the secrets of all hearts shall be
[36:56] disclosed. If either of you know of any
[36:58] impediment while you may not be lawfully
[37:00] joined together, you do now confess it.
[37:03] For any persons being joined together
[37:05] otherwise, and God's word do allow their
[37:07] marriage is not lawful. But believing
[37:10] that you have considered this solemn
[37:12] obligation before these witnesses and
[37:15] God, we will proceed.
[37:19] Fred,
[37:21] will you have this woman to be your
[37:23] lawful wedded wife to live together in
[37:27] the holy state of matrimony? Do you
[37:30] promise to love and honor and cherish
[37:34] and support her in sickness and riches
[37:37] or poverty and forsake all others as
[37:41] long as you both shall live?
[37:43] &gt;&gt; I do. Eliza, will you have this man to
[37:47] be your lawful wedded husband to live
[37:50] together in the holy state of matrimony?
[37:53] Do you promise to love, honor, cherish,
[37:57] obey, support, and sickness, health,
[38:01] riches, or poverty, and cleave you only
[38:05] unto him so long as you both shall live.
[38:10] Repeat these words after me.
[38:14] I Fred take you Eliza
[38:16] &gt;&gt; I Fred take you Eliza
[38:18] &gt;&gt; to my wed wife
[38:19] &gt;&gt; to my wed wife

[38:38] &gt;&gt; To love.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; To cherish.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; To cherish.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Till death us do part. till death do his
[38:43] part.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Eliza, repeat these words after me. I
[38:46] Eliza take you fre

[38:58] &gt;&gt; For better, for worse.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; For richer, for poor.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; For richer, for poor.

[39:11] I'll require a token
[39:14] is a symbol of your love.
[39:17] Thank you.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Place this on his finger.
[39:24] Say these words after me. With this
[39:26] ring.

[39:29] &gt;&gt; I be wed.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[39:49] With this ring
[39:50] &gt;&gt; With this ring,
[39:51] &gt;&gt; I wed
[39:52] &gt;&gt; I be wed.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[40:03] [Music]
[40:16] Wipe your tears. Take a breath. Lay your
[40:20] head on my chest.
[40:23] Let me hold you through the night.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The world can bring us down, but I
[40:33] still believe somehow
[40:36] it's all going to be all right.
[40:41] Come what may,
[40:43] the highs, the lows,
[40:47] well, this life will be hard, but you
[40:50] and me won't.
[40:54] When the waters rise and we face the
[40:57] fire, we'll rest in our foundation. Hand
[41:00] in hand on our knees. Nothing between
[41:05] us.
[41:06] You, me, and Jesus.
[41:11] [Music]
[41:21] Oh, we'll have a few fights.
[41:24] Who's wrong and who's right,
[41:28] but I want you to know
[41:34] &gt;&gt; at the end of the day,
[41:38] I'm always here to stay. Though, you'll
[41:41] never be alone.
[41:45] Come one day.
[41:48] The highs, the lows.
[41:51] Well, this life will be hard, but you
[41:54] and me won't.
[41:58] When the waters rise and we face the
[42:01] fire, we'll rest in our foundation. Hand
[42:05] in hand on our knees. The pin between
[42:09] us.
[42:10] You, me, and Jesus.
[42:13] Oh,
[42:28] come on. May
[42:30] the highs, the lows.
[42:34] Well, this life will be hard, but you
[42:37] and me won't.
[42:40] Oh, when it's time to say goodbye, we'll
[42:44] rest in our foundation.
[42:50] Hand in hand on our knees, nothing
[42:54] between us.
[42:56] Cuz in the end, even death could only
[43:00] lead us
[43:05] to you, me, and Jesus.
[43:24] Can we bow our heads together?
[43:28] Heavenly Father, only you would know the
[43:31] number of couples that have stood since
[43:34] the dawn of time to be joined together.
[43:38] Many of them with your blessing, many of
[43:41] them with your approval, many others
[43:44] without.
[43:45] But Lord, we're believing and praying
[43:47] today for your blessings to be upon Fred
[43:51] and Elias as they start their new life
[43:53] together. May the presence of God always
[43:58] be welcome in their home, in their
[44:00] lives.
[44:02] as the song has just expressed it for
[44:05] them to love each other. That's a
[44:06] wonderful thing. That's a human value, a
[44:09] human trait that we can do. People do it
[44:12] all the time without you in their lives.
[44:14] But Lord Jesus, how much greater it is
[44:17] when you are that one. I pray that you
[44:20] would help them. Give them love for each
[44:23] other. Dear God, give them forgiveness,
[44:26] understanding,
[44:27] all that they make out of life. May it
[44:30] be pleasing to you.
[44:33] We don't always look at a wedding maybe
[44:36] quite in the right way, but in reality
[44:39] when they step off of this platform here
[44:41] in a few minutes and they will be
[44:43] greeted in a little bit by family,
[44:46] friends, and loved ones smiling, hugging
[44:48] them, shaking their hands. But
[44:52] truthfully, they will enter into a
[44:54] battlefield, one like they've never
[44:57] fought before.
[44:59] Because these two hearts have be merged
[45:01] together. Fred has his ways, his makeup.
[45:04] Eliza has hers. Now they will come from
[45:08] him from his family, her from her
[45:11] family. He will bring a normal. She will
[45:13] bring a normal. And they will start
[45:15] creating a new one. And both of their
[45:18] families will look at it and say, "Well,
[45:20] we didn't do it that way in our house."
[45:21] And no, we didn't do it in our house
[45:23] either, but they're creating a new one.
[45:26] And Lord Jesus, what a new one it will
[45:29] be if you're the creating force there
[45:32] between them. For truly a marriage, if
[45:35] it's sent from God, is a new creation.
[45:40] Just in a few moments, I will make a
[45:43] pronouncement and give their new name.
[45:47] Eliza walked up here, Eliza Davis.
[45:51] But in a few moments, you will walk off
[45:54] of this platform with a new name. So may
[45:58] your grace and your mercy be with them.
[46:00] May your blessings be upon them, Father.
[46:03] We pray in the name of Jesus.
[46:06] Amen.
[46:09] For as much as Fred and Eliza have
[46:12] consented together on holy wedlock and
[46:14] have witnessed the same before God and
[46:16] this company by exchanging vows and
[46:19] exchanging rings. I pronounce they are
[46:22] man and wife in the name of our Lord
[46:24] Jesus Christ. You may kiss your bride.
[46:38] [Applause]
[46:48] Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you
[46:51] Mr. and Mus Frederick Art. God bless
[46:55] you.
