[16:47] prayer requests before the Lord.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, everybody.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just take a second to thank
[17:00] the unsung heroes that make these
[17:02] services go well. These musicians, song
[17:05] leaders, people up there, internet. What
[17:07] would we do without them taking their
[17:10] time away? because they don't get to,
[17:12] you know, and I I just felt like that's
[17:14] something that service after service
[17:16] after service, we get to enjoy all that.
[17:18] And I just wanted to say thank you to
[17:19] them. Thank you guys. Let's pray.
[17:25] [Applause]
[17:28] Heavenly Father, we love you so much and
[17:30] we know, Father, that you have
[17:31] diversities of gifts to help throughout
[17:34] the body, Father. But it's one big
[17:36] blessing from you. You and a corporal
[17:39] body, Father. We love you so much.
[17:41] You've made provision for healing for
[17:44] all these needs. Brother Brandham said,
[17:46] "If you had a need, just ask." and he's
[17:48] he's wanting to do more for us than we
[17:50] can ever imagine on a daily basis if
[17:53] we'll just relax and let him. Father, we
[17:55] believe in you and we'll believe that
[17:57] you're the healer and the healing is
[17:59] already done. If you were here, you
[18:00] couldn't heal us cuz you've already done
[18:02] it. And our needs, you've already met
[18:05] them. So, let's just be patient and walk
[18:07] into them. Father, bless this service
[18:10] tonight. Speak to us. Maybe we have
[18:12] questions in our heart, but Lord, you
[18:14] can direct that gift to answer those
[18:16] questions for us if we'll just be
[18:18] patient. We love you and ask these
[18:19] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[18:21] Christ. Amen.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Man, thank you, brother Keith. Us, if
[18:26] you'll come to this time, we'll receive
[18:28] the heating ties and offering you given
[18:30] us to the Lord, man. We'll sing a song
[18:32] that we beat to death a little bit, but
[18:34] that's okay. What do you sing? Psalm 34.
[18:39] Sorry.
[18:43] I sought the Lord
[18:47] and he answered me
[18:51] and delivered me
[18:56] from every fear.
[19:00] Those who look on him
[19:03] [Applause]
[19:04] are radant.
[19:08] I'll never be the same.
[19:13] I'll never be the same.
[19:17] This poor man cried
[19:21] and the Lord heard me
[19:26] and save me from
[19:30] my eneies.
[19:35] The son of God
[19:39] surrounds his saints.

[24:09] He'll give you everything.
[24:20] Amen.
[24:22] I love good worship songs like that. But
[24:25] there's another little country boy part
[24:27] of me that likes southern gospel songs
[24:28] like this next one. Most of a lot of
[24:31] y'all don't know, but I think I've said
[24:33] it before. I have loved the Henson's. I
[24:37] don't know if Kenny Henson was alive
[24:38] when I was alive, maybe for a couple
[24:40] years, but I have I've loved the
[24:42] Henson's. And this is old Henson song.
[24:44] I'm sure other people have recorded it,
[24:46] too. But I never shall forget the day
[24:49] when all the burdens of my soul just
[24:53] it was long gone. Amen.
[24:56] Long years ago, boy went out in sin.
[25:02] I had no hope,
[25:05] no peace within.
[25:08] Down on my knees
[25:10] in agony.
[25:13] I prayed to Jesus and he gladly set me
[25:17] free. I never shall
[25:22] forget the day
[25:24] when all the burdens of my soul are wor.
[25:30] It made me happy,
[25:33] glad, and free.
[25:35] I'll sing and shout it for he's
[25:38] everything to me.
[25:41] Now I can feel
[25:43] him by my side.
[25:46] my feeble steps.
[25:49] He comes to God.
[25:52] When trials come,
[25:55] he comforts me.
[25:57] Through him or sin, I have the victory.
[26:03] I never shall
[26:06] forget the day
[26:09] when all the burdens of my sorrow away.
[26:14] It made me happy,
[26:17] glad, and free.
[26:20] I sing and shout it for he's everything
[26:23] to me.
[26:25] Oh sinner, come
[26:28] to Jesus now.
[26:31] And at his dear feet, all you got to do
[26:34] is humbly bow. Confess to him
[26:39] your every sin.
[26:42] He'll save and cleanse you, give you
[26:44] peace and joy within. Oh, I never shall.
[26:50] Forget the day
[26:53] when all the burdens of my soul rolled
[26:57] away.
[26:59] It made me happy,
[27:02] glad, and free.
[27:04] I'll sing and shout it for he's
[27:07] everything to me.
[27:10] I never shout.
[27:13] Sister Harmony, you come on up. Brother
[27:15] Aaron, all the burdens of my soul were
[27:19] away.
[27:21] It made me happy,
[27:24] glad, and free.
[27:27] I'll sing and shout it for he's
[27:30] everything to me.
[27:32] Oh sinner, come
[27:35] to Jesus now.
[27:38] and at his dear feet. All he got to do
[27:41] is humbly bow. Confess to him
[27:46] your every sin.
[27:49] He'll save and cleanse you. Give you
[27:51] peace and joy within. Oh, I never shall
[27:58] forget the day
[28:00] when all the burdens of my soul were

[28:06] It made me happy,
[28:09] glad, and free.

[28:22] singers a hand. They get ready to sing.
[28:38] [Music]
[28:48] Amen. If you know this song, you can
[28:49] sing it with me tonight. We've sang it

[34:09] [Music]
[34:11] My Jesus,
[34:14] he's always
[34:16] on time.
[34:19] And though you may see
[34:24] a valley,
[34:27] [Music]
[34:29] this is the mountain you'll be standing
[34:35] on.
[34:39] When
[34:40] all you can see are the tears falling
[34:46] down.
[34:49] I'm
[34:51] so glad he sees what we don't.
[34:58] [Music]
[35:00] I've seen his children walk through
[35:05] the darkest of midnight.
[35:10] I witnessed faith put to the test.
[35:17] And I've watched as the storms blew
[35:23] and with the thunder.
[35:27] But in each trial
[35:30] he knows what's best.
[35:34] And I am so blind.
[35:38] He knows what's best.
[35:44] And though you may see
[35:49] a valley,
[35:50] [Music]
[35:54] this is the mountain you'll be standing
[36:00] on.
[36:03] When
[36:05] all you can see are the tears falling
[36:11] down.
[36:14] I'm so glad he sees what we don't.
[36:24] He knows the end from the beginning.
[36:30] [Applause]
[36:31] [Music]
[36:33] He looks ahead
[36:36] the hurt and the pain
[36:42] to a place where the peace passes all
[36:49] understanding.
[36:50] [Music]
[36:54] He sees the sun through the rain.
[37:04] And though you may see
[37:09] your valley,
[37:11] [Music]
[37:14] this is the mountain you'll be standing
[37:20] on.
[37:23] When all you can see are the tears
[37:30] falling down.
[37:34] I'm so glad he sees what we don't.
[37:42] And I am so glad he sees what we
[37:50] don't.

[38:21] arms reach away. Amen.
[38:27] Touching Jesus
[38:31] is all
[38:33] that really matters.
[38:40] And then your life
[38:43] will never be
[38:47] the same.
[38:49] [Music]
[38:52] Oh, there's only
[38:56] one way
[38:59] to touch him.
[39:02] him. You just believe
[39:07] when you call on
[39:11] his name.
[39:14] Let's sing that first verse.
[39:17] Oh,
[39:20] tried so many
[39:23] positions,
[39:29] yet grew worse.
[39:32] So, to Jesus
[39:36] she came.
[39:42] And when
[39:44] the crowd
[39:47] tried to restrain her.
[39:53] Oh, she whispered
[39:57] these words through
[40:00] her pain.
[40:03] at all.
[40:05] Touching Jesus
[40:09] is all
[40:11] that really matters.
[40:16] [Music]
[40:26] [Music]
[40:31] for there's only
[40:34] one way
[40:37] you can touch him.
[40:41] Aren't you glad?
[40:43] Just believe
[40:46] when you call on
[40:49] his name.
[40:51] Let's sing that second verse together.
[40:55] I was bound
[40:58] when I knew
[41:05] it.
[41:07] They said Jesus
[41:11] could meet
[41:13] my every need.
[41:20] When this prisoner
[41:23] finally
[41:26] I got a hold to Jesus.
[41:29] Oh,
[41:31] he made me free.
[41:35] Praise his name.
[41:38] I'm free indeed. Everybody now. Thank
[41:42] God
[41:44] that you Jesus
[41:48] is all
[41:50] that really matters.
[41:54] Thank you, Lord God. And in your life
[41:59] will never be
[42:03] the same.
[42:07] We're so grateful, Lord. There's only
[42:13] one way
[42:15] to touch him.
[42:19] Oh, yes.
[42:21] Just
[42:24] when you call on
[42:28] his name.
[42:30] [Music]
[42:35] Praise the Lord.
[42:38] Heavenly Father, how grateful we are
[42:40] tonight
[42:42] that it's just that simple.
[42:46] No doubt many of these people have been
[42:48] serving you for a long, long time.
[42:51] and they've had all sorts of tests and
[42:54] trials and difficulties in their life.
[42:58] One way they approach you when they're
[43:00] going through this trial and they
[43:02] approach you another way and another
[43:04] way. But in reality, it all comes down
[43:07] to one simple way. We believe when we
[43:11] ask
[43:13] and we pray as you pray. if there's
[43:16] anything that we would pray that would
[43:18] be contrary to your will that your will
[43:20] would be done. So, Father, we're praying
[43:23] again tonight and we believe it's
[43:25] according to your will that we ask that
[43:29] you be among us, that you move among us
[43:32] tonight. We have sick, we have those
[43:35] that are going through various things in
[43:37] their life. Some, Lord, couldn't be in
[43:39] church tonight because they're
[43:41] physically sick. We're praying for them.
[43:44] Father, some pressed on and they came
[43:47] even though in reality they didn't feel
[43:49] like coming. But I ask you that you'd
[43:52] bless their efforts tonight. Lord Jesus,
[43:55] help me that I can get out of the way,
[43:57] Father, that I can speak those things
[44:00] that'll be beneficial to your people
[44:03] tonight. We want to say how much we love
[44:06] you and how grateful we are that we can
[44:09] come to church on Wednesday night. Thank
[44:13] you for it, Lord. Bless our time
[44:15] together now, Father. We pray in the
[44:17] name of the Lord Jesus.
[44:19] Amen.
[44:21] Praise the Lord. How many can say it's
[44:24] good to be a child of God?
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that God got a hold to
[44:30] your heart and won't let go?
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Won't let go. Praise God. Turn with me
[44:37] if you would tonight to Genesis chapter
[44:39] 24.
[44:40] Certainly um appreciate you praying for
[44:43] us while we was over at the camp this
[44:45] past weekend and the Lord did some
[44:47] wonderful things. The brothers really
[44:49] really submitted theirel to the Lord and
[44:52] already heard some really wonderful
[44:54] testimonies of what God did. It's always
[44:58] it's always wonderful when his children
[44:59] gather together, isn't it? I understand
[45:01] brother Joe did a really good job here
[45:03] and y'all were blessed to be in church
[45:05] and
[45:06] &gt;&gt; it does the pastor's heart good whenever
[45:08] you hear that service is good and
[45:10] people's needs were met.
[45:13] Genesis chap 24:58. I want to speak to
[45:16] you again tonight on the bride's dowy.
[45:20] Now remember the dowy was given to her
[45:23] by her father to help her in her
[45:26] journey. And in this situation, it's
[45:30] Rebecca's journey, of course, that she's
[45:32] going 450 to 500 miles, something like
[45:35] that, depending on which trade route
[45:38] that they went on. Uh month and a half
[45:41] up to two months, uh again, depending on
[45:43] which one they took on the back of a
[45:46] camel. And they called Rebecca and said
[45:48] unto her, "Wil thou go with this man?"
[45:50] and she said, "Let me Google him
[45:55] and see if I can find anything about him
[45:58] on YouTube.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Let me ask my grandma,
[46:03] my uncle."
[46:05] Well, you better not go to asking some
[46:07] of them. You get really in trouble,
[46:08] wouldn't you? And they called Rebecca
[46:11] and said unto her, "Well, thou go with
[46:12] this man." And she said, "I will go."
[46:15] And they sent away Rebecca, their
[46:17] sister, her nurse, and Abraham's
[46:19] servant, and his men. And they blessed
[46:21] Rebecca, and said unto her, "Thou art
[46:23] our sister. Be thou the mother of
[46:25] thousands of millions. And let thy seed
[46:30] possess the gate of those which hate
[46:33] them." And Rebecca arose in her damsels,
[46:36] and they rode upon the camels, and
[46:37] followed the man. And the servant took
[46:40] Rebecca, and went his way. May the Lord
[46:43] bless his words. You may be seated.
[46:46] Read with me if you would in Ephesians
[46:48] chapter 3:8.
[46:50] We will move from the desert and we will
[46:53] come to another man who also met God in
[46:59] a desert. We're talking about Apostle
[47:01] Paul. Now remember, he was not one of
[47:04] the original 12. He was not one of the
[47:06] ones that was personally called by
[47:09] Jesus. He never hunted with Jesus, never
[47:12] fished with Jesus. He was not one of
[47:15] those that ate with Jesus. He had
[47:18] nothing to do with Jesus. Actually,
[47:20] though Paul, now think of it, Paul was
[47:22] alive when Jesus was here. But it was
[47:26] not Paul's time for the light to shine
[47:30] on Paul. And yet, God had greater
[47:33] revelation in store for this man than he
[47:36] did any of those that actually were with
[47:40] the Lord Jesus physically. And we know
[47:43] that you don't know Jesus after the
[47:46] flesh. Now, Peter thought that he knew
[47:48] the Lord and he thought that he knew
[47:50] himself. But come to find out, he didn't
[47:53] know either one very well because he
[47:55] made a pretty much a a great drastic
[47:58] mistake. And if it hadn't been for the
[47:59] grace of God, he would have been lost
[48:01] forever. But thank God, his name was on
[48:03] the book. But here we're looking at a
[48:05] man that never knew him physically,
[48:07] never saw him, uh may have never known
[48:10] anything about his family, nothing like
[48:12] that. But the Lord Jesus appeared to him
[48:15] in a supernatural way. And I hope you
[48:17] understand what I'm going to say that
[48:19] many times the way people come to God
[48:23] and the way they are born will set a
[48:26] birth for their walk and their journey.
[48:30] Now, many people come to the Lord, and
[48:33] I'm not saying now tonight that you've
[48:34] got to run and jump and shout, although
[48:36] I believe in that, and I think we ought
[48:38] to do more of it myself, as long as we
[48:40] live right whenever we get done running
[48:41] and jumping and shouting. But what I
[48:43] found is that for many people who come
[48:46] to God and there's hardly no emotion
[48:49] whatsoever in their experience with the
[48:52] Lord, I'm talking about crying as an
[48:54] emotion as well as the shouting and all
[48:56] that, too. And yet they seem to have no
[48:59] great change about them. They just dry
[49:02] eyed or dryeyed confession as the
[49:04] prophet called it. And they come to the
[49:06] Lord and mentally psychologically they
[49:09] go to mapping out in their mind what
[49:12] they need to do to be a Christian. So
[49:14] they pick out all the dos and the don'ts
[49:16] and can and cannots and should and
[49:18] should notss and they go to try to
[49:20] psychologically like the self-help books
[49:22] of the modern day and they take the
[49:25] message in the same way and then they
[49:27] try to comply and they try to do but
[49:29] what can I do? What can I do? Several
[49:32] years ago, there was a man that came to
[49:33] our church from another state and he
[49:35] come to brother Jim Babin. He said,
[49:36] "Brother Jim," he said, "I want to know
[49:39] what is the largest amount that anybody
[49:42] in the church pays tithe." And he said,
[49:45] "Well, brother, that is a very private
[49:47] thing. We don't divulge that." He said,
[49:49] "Well, no, I'm not asking now about the
[49:52] individual, but he said, I just want to
[49:55] know how much it is because I want to
[49:57] pay more than everybody else." because
[50:00] he said, "I I want to have an
[50:02] identification. I want to have something
[50:05] that I'm known by." Well, I do, too.
[50:09] It's a new verse, but it has nothing to
[50:11] do with paying the largest amount of
[50:13] tithe or singing the loudest or, you
[50:15] know, any of that sort of thing. But you
[50:17] realize that there's an element of
[50:19] people that when they come to the Lord,
[50:21] it's totally psychology on a spiritual
[50:25] sense. So they approach God from the
[50:27] mental aspect and they think it all
[50:30] through. So they think about salvation,
[50:32] they think about Jesus dying, they
[50:34] approach the message in the same way. So
[50:36] it's psychological. They think about,
[50:38] okay, so it makes sense that God would
[50:40] send a prophet. They understand and they
[50:43] they take in serpent seed
[50:45] psychologically and you'll hear them say
[50:47] it, well that makes so much sense. That
[50:50] makes so much sense. That makes more
[50:52] sense than anything I've ever heard. So
[50:55] they believe it that way and they
[50:57] believe water baptism in the name of the
[50:59] Lord Jesus. Well, that makes perfect
[51:01] sense. Now, myself, I'm a little bit
[51:03] leery of individuals whenever they come
[51:06] and everything they hear makes perfect
[51:09] sense. Because I don't mind telling you,
[51:11] there's a lot of things I've heard that
[51:13] made no sense at all.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; None. Zilto, zero. But you know what?
[51:19] I'm glad that God gave me another sense
[51:21] other than human sense, it's called
[51:24] revelation. So when you hear it and
[51:27] something in your soul punctuates it
[51:30] that it is the word of God even though
[51:32] your mind may not be able to put it
[51:34] together and your psyche which is your
[51:37] psychological part of course and it
[51:39] tries to process it all and it just
[51:41] don't it just don't compute. It just
[51:43] don't come together. Now, we know that
[51:45] there's always that supernatural element
[51:48] about every member that comes to the
[51:50] Lord Jesus. And he wants them to have
[51:53] that that physical part. Nothing wrong
[51:56] with the psyche. Now, nothing wrong with
[51:58] your mind and you think about it and you
[52:00] process it unless you're basing your
[52:03] salvation upon your mind and what you
[52:05] can comprehend from your mind alone.
[52:08] Because Jesus told us no man would ever
[52:12] be able to come to him unless he would
[52:15] be born again. And he said you must be
[52:17] born by what? By water and by spirit.
[52:21] Not psychological thinking about it. Not
[52:24] psychology, not mind over matter, but by
[52:27] water and by spirit. Three elements came
[52:29] out of the body of the Lord Jesus. Those
[52:32] elements were given to produce a new
[52:34] birth for you and I. What were those
[52:37] elements? an encyclopedia,
[52:39] a dictionary, a psychology class. What
[52:43] was it? Water, blood, spirit. Now,
[52:47] whenever we come to the Lord, will those
[52:49] three elements deal with our psyche?
[52:52] Yes. How are we going to understand the
[52:54] word? Faith comes by hearing and hearing
[52:58] by the word of God. So, what do we do?
[53:00] We hear it with our ears. Now, that's as
[53:03] far as a lot of people go. They go from
[53:06] there. But remember, you have two wounds
[53:09] as a spirit being and it goes into their
[53:12] mind. They hear it in their ears.
[53:13] They're sitting there processing as some
[53:15] of you are doing it right now. And
[53:17] you're processing and you're thinking
[53:18] about what I'm saying and you're trying
[53:20] to keep up and you're trying to, you
[53:21] know, compute it all. And then if that's
[53:24] as far as it goes, you'll never be born
[53:26] again. But there is also a womb inside
[53:30] of you. And in your soul, you conceive
[53:33] of that soul. Think of it. It still
[53:36] comes by hearing in the ears. But the
[53:39] intellectual person hears by the ears.
[53:42] It goes into the head. They process it.
[53:45] Okay. This is on the mantel. This is on
[53:47] the shelf. I don't understand that. I
[53:49] don't think I believe it that way. And
[53:51] once they look at it, they got more on
[53:53] the shelf than they got in their heart.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I'm always scared of all
[53:57] those things we put on the mantel. What
[53:59] if some of those things are required?
[54:02] and we've laid them up on the mantle cuz
[54:04] we didn't think we needed them.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; We're going to be in a mess of trouble
[54:07] on the day of the rapture, aren't we?
[54:09] So, you realize that that's exactly now
[54:12] what happened to Rebecca in a phenomenal
[54:15] realm, the angels of God had already
[54:19] come to her. Now remember, she did not
[54:22] know when Eleazar way back now, several
[54:27] months before this event, Eleazar had
[54:30] been called into his master's tent,
[54:33] Abraham. And he tells him that he wants
[54:35] to go and make this journey, and you've
[54:38] read it, of course, but he gives him a
[54:40] little bit of a background on why he
[54:42] wants him to go into the land of his
[54:45] people. Now he told him the reason was
[54:48] he did not want his son to take a wife
[54:52] from the Canaanites. Now why weren't
[54:55] there women there? Were not they humans?
[54:58] They were. Were they Martians? No. Were
[55:01] they from another planet? No. But they
[55:05] were from another nation. nations which
[55:08] practiced idolatry and would sacrifice
[55:12] their children on the altars of Kimosh.
[55:16] And they would do all kinds of
[55:18] horrendous things. And Abraham forbid
[55:22] his servant from taking a wife to Isaac
[55:26] out of those nations, the Canaanite
[55:30] nations. He said, "You go to my people."
[55:34] Oh, I wish our message people could
[55:36] learn that. That's where you need to go
[55:39] for your husband or your wife
[55:42] &gt;&gt; is your people.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Now notice, but then whenever he he lays
[55:48] a message out to this model servant and
[55:51] he says, "What if the woman won't leave?
[55:54] What if the woman will not come with me?
[55:57] What will I do?" He said, "Do not take a
[56:00] woman." Again, it reminds him from the
[56:02] daughters of the Canaanites.
[56:05] But he said, "The angel of the Lord will
[56:10] go before you." Now, this is the basis
[56:14] of this messenger's bride call. A
[56:18] supernatural angel will go before him.
[56:22] Now remember, the prophet tells us that
[56:24] about 30 minutes before he ever got to
[56:27] the well, an angel went down to
[56:30] Rebecca's house and told Rebecca to go
[56:34] up to the well because it was time. Now,
[56:36] I want you to notice what Eleazar did.
[56:39] And looking for the bride, he did not go
[56:43] to a bar.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; He did not go to a brothel. He did not
[56:49] go to some type of worldly event. Where
[56:54] did he go?
[56:56] The well.
[56:58] Now, going to the well is a good thing,
[57:01] but you've got to go at the right time
[57:04] in order for the virgins to come.
[57:08] Because the way it was in those days,
[57:11] even up in the time of the Lord Jesus,
[57:13] the impure women were not allowed to go
[57:16] when the virgins went.
[57:20] So Eleazar couldn't just go to the well,
[57:24] but he had to go to the well at a
[57:26] certain time. And the angel of the Lord
[57:29] dealt with him on the timeline and he
[57:32] dealt with Rebecca on the timeline
[57:34] because it's quite a a a several hour
[57:37] period or interval by which she could go
[57:41] say from 7 to 10. So it's quite a span
[57:44] there by which the virgins would come
[57:46] and then as the woman at the well in St.
[57:48] John 4 that woman come later in the day
[57:50] they were not allowed to associate
[57:52] together. No, they weren't. So she could
[57:56] not go up when the virgins went. So if
[57:59] where he went is going to typify the
[58:02] type of woman that he's looking for.
[58:05] Now, it still would not be complimentary
[58:07] to Abraham's uh message nor to Isaac
[58:12] loving him if he would have went all of
[58:15] that distance to the land of Mesopotamia
[58:17] and there he would have went to a
[58:19] brothel and picked a woman there of out
[58:23] of a brothel or a woman out of some type
[58:26] of filthy ungodly place and carried that
[58:29] type of woman right back even though she
[58:32] come from a church. I I mean
[58:34] Mesopotamia.
[58:36] She had to be a virgin.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; And if she's a virgin, she ain't got no
[58:41] business at a brothel.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Y'all ain't lost your amen sent out of
[58:46] you. All right. I just want to make
[58:47] sure. So everything is timed by God. But
[58:52] now remember,
[58:54] it was under angelic
[58:57] observation.
[58:59] Now listen to me.
[59:01] God knew before the foundation of the
[59:05] world that man would come on the earth
[59:09] and that man would fall. He didn't make
[59:11] him do it, but he knew that he would.
[59:14] But he did predestinate a man that would
[59:17] require salvation in order to give
[59:21] himself reason and purpose of being. So
[59:26] before he ever made the man, he brought
[59:28] the angels. Some of them into existence
[59:35] as beings with an allocation of time.
[59:40] Others are elect angels. So it wasn't
[59:44] lying that they actually would start on
[59:48] a certain day, but they come from the
[59:51] essence of eternity.
[59:54] And God gave them an angelic body that
[59:59] could be able to appear. So everything
[1:00:01] eternal issued and came forth from
[1:00:05] where? The eternal. So everything then
[1:00:09] that come out of the eternal. The
[1:00:12] essence of what was there in him never
[1:00:16] started. Now he could put them in a body
[1:00:20] of time or he could put them in an
[1:00:24] element of time but that was not their
[1:00:26] origination nor their being. Now, they
[1:00:30] actually come from the essence. And here
[1:00:32] we come back to what I spoke to you last
[1:00:35] Wednesday night that the angels of God
[1:00:37] had to be told to worship the Lord Jesus
[1:00:44] because
[1:00:45] there was no three gods in heaven and
[1:00:49] they never seen no son sitting on the
[1:00:54] right hand of the father. If they if he
[1:00:58] would have been there in that form, they
[1:01:00] would have seen him for aons of time.
[1:01:04] But they never saw him that way. Why? He
[1:01:08] wasn't there that way.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; But his essence came out of where? The
[1:01:16] same place you came out of. If you've
[1:01:19] got eternal life
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; now, that's why you never started on any
[1:01:24] certain day. Now, sure, your body's got
[1:01:27] a birthday, and you can you'll have a
[1:01:29] day you die if you go by time. But yet,
[1:01:31] the essence of who you are in your soul
[1:01:35] never actually started on any certain
[1:01:38] day. And this is why Paul addresses a
[1:01:41] certain category of angelic beings and
[1:01:44] calls them elect angels. So all angels
[1:01:49] were not elected, but yet they were
[1:01:53] created and given an angelic sphere or
[1:01:58] dimension by which they would move about
[1:02:02] and they would have access to
[1:02:04] supernatural realms and things appear,
[1:02:06] disappear, do all sorts of things. And
[1:02:08] they would be so close that they could
[1:02:11] almost look like and almost appear as
[1:02:15] the angels of God. So they could come
[1:02:19] and anoint people. They could anoint
[1:02:23] preachers. They could anoint leoty. They
[1:02:26] could anoint kings, presidents,
[1:02:28] monarchs. Just depending on how Satan
[1:02:31] divided them when they fell. Some would
[1:02:34] be sent into the political realm, some
[1:02:36] into the realm of diseases, some would
[1:02:39] be sent into the religious realm. And
[1:02:41] those guys are the worst of all. They're
[1:02:43] the most deceiving. So God then knowing
[1:02:47] that man once he did fall that man would
[1:02:51] have three realms above him like this
[1:02:55] and then man would have three realms
[1:02:57] below him like this. And man would be in
[1:03:00] that stream of time. And then these
[1:03:03] three realms down here would constantly
[1:03:06] be trying to penetrate into the land of
[1:03:10] time where man dwells. And these three
[1:03:13] realms up here would also be doing the
[1:03:16] same thing. So right now we're caught
[1:03:18] right in this time. And every day that
[1:03:21] we live on the earth, our lives are
[1:03:24] under the influence of these six realms.
[1:03:28] Now this what the prophet taught. Y'all
[1:03:30] know that, right? Three roomms above
[1:03:31] you, three rooms below you. So God knew
[1:03:33] then whenever man fell that before he
[1:03:37] ever fell, the angels already fell
[1:03:40] before him. Had God taken from them
[1:03:44] their ability to access the fourth
[1:03:48] dimension. Now remember the fourth
[1:03:50] dimension is light, matter, time,
[1:03:53] science, where the unbeliever goes,
[1:03:55] where the believer goes, and where God
[1:03:56] is. seven dimensions. In the fourth
[1:03:59] dimension is where prophets had their
[1:04:02] visions. So in that realm, a prophet
[1:04:06] could have a vision and he would go back
[1:04:08] maybe 150 years, 200 years or like Moses
[1:04:12] when God put Moses in the cliff to the
[1:04:14] rock and Moses went plum back to the
[1:04:17] very beginning. In the beginning, God
[1:04:20] created the heavens and the earth and
[1:04:22] the earth was without form and void and
[1:04:24] darkness covered the face of the deep.
[1:04:26] No one had ever written that. But God
[1:04:28] set Moses in that secret place in the
[1:04:31] rock and carried him plum back to the
[1:04:34] beginning. And before that, what
[1:04:37] happened? Well, before that, angels had
[1:04:40] already fallen. And yet, there were who
[1:04:43] knows how many there were. One of the
[1:04:45] Greek words that the Bible uses to
[1:04:47] describe the number of them is myriads.
[1:04:50] So, it's just almost an innumerable
[1:04:53] amount. But there was an element of them
[1:04:56] that were placed on a similar basis that
[1:04:59] Adam was in the Garden of Eden. And that
[1:05:02] was a basis by which they could be
[1:05:06] tried. That God could have given Adam
[1:05:09] the seal of the Holy Ghost on his soul
[1:05:13] in the Garden of Eden. Remember,
[1:05:15] whatever Adam had, he lost it.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; So, it couldn't have been the seal of
[1:05:21] the Holy Ghost on his soul. People say,
[1:05:24] "Well, I want to go back where Adam
[1:05:25] was." I don't. I want to go farther
[1:05:28] back.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Whatever Adam had, he lost
[1:05:34] it.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? If you got the Holy
[1:05:37] Ghost out in your soul, you're already
[1:05:40] farther back than Adam was in the Garden
[1:05:42] of Eden.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Because if you've got it in your soul,
[1:05:46] you'll never lose it. It'll never leave
[1:05:49] you. Oh, you'll make mistakes and fall
[1:05:51] short. But brother, sister, your soul is
[1:05:54] sealed plum to eternity. My, that ought
[1:05:57] to make a Baptist person shout
[1:05:59] hallelujah.
[1:06:01] But before that man was ever brought on
[1:06:03] the earth, the angels had fallen. Now
[1:06:05] they were they were in a realm that Adam
[1:06:08] more than likely had not been exposed to
[1:06:11] as of yet. But he is fixing to get under
[1:06:15] the influence of that. And of course, we
[1:06:17] know that that what was it that tempted
[1:06:20] the woman in the Garden of Eden anyway?
[1:06:23] It was the prince of fallen angels. Now,
[1:06:27] God knew then if there's going to be an
[1:06:30] element of fallen angels, they will have
[1:06:33] power, they will have authority. Even
[1:06:36] when they fall, they will maintain the
[1:06:40] angelic rank that they had before their
[1:06:44] fall. The book of Daniel declares that
[1:06:46] to us because Daniel was praying and
[1:06:49] praying and finally the angel of God
[1:06:51] come and broke through and he said,
[1:06:53] "Your prayer was heard 21 days ago." You
[1:06:56] imagine Daniel's thinking, "Well, what
[1:06:57] in the world took you so long to get
[1:06:58] here then?" But what was it? It was the
[1:07:01] prince, that demon that was over that
[1:07:05] area, that kingdom. And that angel sent
[1:07:09] from God, still in his proper position,
[1:07:13] did not outrank the demon that was over
[1:07:16] that empire. Now, think of how they
[1:07:19] were. I want you to think whenever the
[1:07:22] devil went to looking around for the
[1:07:24] body of Moses and then the angel said
[1:07:28] they the Lord rebuked thee, Satan. And
[1:07:31] remember in Zachchariah as well, the
[1:07:33] Lord rebuked thee. Well, why didn't that
[1:07:36] angel say, "I rebuke thee?" Why would
[1:07:39] that angel use the presence of Adonai?
[1:07:44] Do you understand? I'm going to go ahead
[1:07:46] and say it to you. Do you understand? In
[1:07:47] some ways, as sons and daughters of God
[1:07:50] filled with the Holy Ghost, we have more
[1:07:52] authority than the angels of God do.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Do you understand, oh my, that God will
[1:07:59] hear the prayer of a saint, a child of
[1:08:01] God, quicker? He, the prophet said, then
[1:08:04] he would the request of the holy angel
[1:08:06] which has never sinned.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Frank think of it,
[1:08:10] friends. This is part of your dowy given
[1:08:12] to you by the father on your journey
[1:08:15] that when you get in trouble that you
[1:08:17] can understand he has all of these
[1:08:20] things laid up in store for you as the
[1:08:22] people of God. So are we here then in
[1:08:26] this world and the three main influences
[1:08:28] that most of us deal with are the lower
[1:08:31] influences of Satan and his demons and
[1:08:33] then hell. Well, what about the other
[1:08:36] three? I imagine one of these days it
[1:08:39] will be surprising to us when we realize
[1:08:43] by the grace of God how much our
[1:08:46] everyday life has been affected by
[1:08:49] angels.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And because you didn't see them,
[1:08:54] you didn't think they were there. Now, I
[1:08:58] don't mind telling you, most of us are
[1:09:00] not made to be able to for our eyes to
[1:09:03] peer into that supernatural realm. Now,
[1:09:07] some of you probably have seen things
[1:09:08] before. I've seen angels. I've seen
[1:09:11] demons. And I don't mind telling you, as
[1:09:12] far as in the demonic world, I'm good if
[1:09:15] I never see another one. I don't like
[1:09:17] seeing them, okay? I don't like it. I
[1:09:19] don't enjoy I don't enjoy it. Because
[1:09:21] once you ever see one, once you sense
[1:09:23] that presence, from that time on, you'll
[1:09:25] never be the same. Then every time you
[1:09:28] get around a presence similar to that,
[1:09:30] even though you don't see it, you'll
[1:09:32] know he's there. And it it it can it can
[1:09:34] bother you. This right here I'm talking
[1:09:36] about. And it's the same with angelic
[1:09:38] beings, you know, that I've seen a few
[1:09:40] myself and it just make you so weak and
[1:09:43] make you shake and tremble. Just it's
[1:09:46] hard to explain what it does. But yet
[1:09:48] God has his angels that are encamped
[1:09:52] about his children and they never leave
[1:09:55] you. They are with you every day of your
[1:10:01] life.
[1:10:03] Now watch Paul the great anointed church
[1:10:07] age messenger of the first age and he's
[1:10:10] identifying this great mystery in
[1:10:13] Ephesians 3:8. unto me who am less than
[1:10:16] the least of all saints is the grace
[1:10:18] given that I should preach among the
[1:10:21] Gentiles the unsearchable
[1:10:24] riches of Christ and to make all men see
[1:10:27] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[1:10:30] which from the beginning of the world
[1:10:32] has been hid in God who created all
[1:10:36] things by Jesus Christ. Now remember,
[1:10:39] he's the first one to bring Jesus Christ
[1:10:43] into this spot that it was by him, the
[1:10:47] amorph word that all things were
[1:10:50] created. Notice now in verse 10, to the
[1:10:54] intent that now unto the principalities
[1:10:58] and powers and heavenly places might be
[1:11:02] known by the church. Astounding.
[1:11:06] Absolutely astounding. to the intent
[1:11:09] that now the principalities
[1:11:12] and the powers. So the angelic realms is
[1:11:16] are being taught great things of God by
[1:11:20] the church. Notice so he does not
[1:11:23] designate cherubams. He does not
[1:11:26] designate zoos. He does not designate
[1:11:30] these holy primitive beings that were
[1:11:32] there for how many ever millions of
[1:11:35] years that it's been. He does not get
[1:11:37] ones that are higher ranking and
[1:11:39] authority. And of course, there are
[1:11:40] those that do that. But yet, the
[1:11:42] greatest instruction that he chose to
[1:11:46] teach angelic beings and illuminate them
[1:11:50] was using the church.
[1:11:53] So the angelic host that would
[1:11:57] understand such things and be able to
[1:12:00] appear and disappear and move in a
[1:12:03] supernatural realm that you and I
[1:12:05] probably know hardly anything about at
[1:12:07] all. And yet God limited them when it
[1:12:10] come to the mystery of redemption and
[1:12:13] salvation and limited their
[1:12:15] understanding when it come to the
[1:12:18] church. So Paul in using this word about
[1:12:21] known it is I know I've shared it with
[1:12:24] you declare certify give to understand.
[1:12:28] So the church is going to be the
[1:12:30] principle means that God will use to
[1:12:34] teach angels about redemption. Now
[1:12:37] notice in Hebrews chapter 1 verse14
[1:12:40] another description in them relating to
[1:12:44] the people of God. Are they not all
[1:12:47] ministering spirits sent forth to
[1:12:50] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[1:12:56] salvation? So the angels are employed by
[1:13:01] God to minister to those who are going
[1:13:05] to be heirs of salvation.
[1:13:09] Notice again now in Matthew chapter 4.
[1:13:12] So the angels of God have this deep
[1:13:15] interest in man and what concerns man
[1:13:19] concerns them. Now watch this in Matthew
[1:13:22] 4:11. This is talking about the Lord
[1:13:25] Jesus. Then the devil leaveth him and
[1:13:29] behold
[1:13:30] angels came and ministered unto him.
[1:13:35] Now, this is exactly the same word that
[1:13:38] was used in the epistles whenever
[1:13:40] Peter's mother-in-law lay sick and Jesus
[1:13:44] raised her up. And the Bible said that
[1:13:46] she ministered unto them. And what did
[1:13:48] she do? She didn't put her hand on her
[1:13:50] hip and preach him a three-hour sermon,
[1:13:52] but she actually it was the word of
[1:13:55] serving them food and drink. So notice
[1:13:59] then the angels of God, remember Jesus
[1:14:02] has just now come off of a 40-day fast.
[1:14:05] So the angels, more than one, the angels
[1:14:09] of God come now and minister to the son
[1:14:14] of man. Listen carefully, the son of
[1:14:17] man. So the angels, did they gave him
[1:14:21] give him bread? Did they give him
[1:14:23] something to drink? Did they minister to
[1:14:25] him in his spirit? We don't know exactly
[1:14:28] what it all involved other than angels
[1:14:31] plural came and ministered unto them.
[1:14:35] Now remember this is the head of the new
[1:14:38] church. So Jesus is living out the type
[1:14:43] for you and I as well that whenever we
[1:14:47] get in difficult times, notice they did
[1:14:50] not come before the fast began. They did
[1:14:53] not come before the temptation began.
[1:14:57] But they came after Jesus endured the
[1:15:00] temptation. Notice, endured the
[1:15:03] temptation and was faithful to the word
[1:15:07] of God without angelic visible
[1:15:10] influence.
[1:15:12] And they come because of his obedience
[1:15:16] and his faithfulness. Children, how many
[1:15:18] times do we keep blessings from the
[1:15:21] angels of God off of our life simply
[1:15:24] because we run out of patience?
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now, notice those in the hour of
[1:15:31] temptation that we'll resist. And then
[1:15:35] remember now, it was not by angelic
[1:15:37] anointing or angelic power that Jesus
[1:15:40] overcame. If that's the way it was, then
[1:15:42] he would have to give it to us every
[1:15:44] time that we're tested and tried as
[1:15:46] well. So the angelic ministering came
[1:15:49] after that it went through that. I
[1:15:51] guarantee you there's way more than just
[1:15:53] three or four people here tonight that
[1:15:55] have come through such difficult times
[1:15:57] in your life and it seemed like at the
[1:16:00] end of that thing that something moved
[1:16:03] for you and lifted you and helped you
[1:16:05] and you think why in the world didn't
[1:16:07] that come while I was in the middle of
[1:16:08] it. Do you understand what just happened
[1:16:10] to you? God just sent an angel to you
[1:16:14] and ministered strength to you because
[1:16:17] you were faithful. Now you see, had he
[1:16:21] done that while the test was going on,
[1:16:24] it would have not been the same. So he's
[1:16:26] trying us. He's testing us. And the
[1:16:29] angels of God are watching our journey
[1:16:32] and being taught by us.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:16:39] I want I want to share something with
[1:16:41] you and uh I'm going to put it up on the
[1:16:43] screen there. I have the brothers just
[1:16:44] so you can read it with me. Socrates
[1:16:47] and Theodor, another historian tell us
[1:16:50] of Theodoris, a m a martyr put to
[1:16:54] extreme torments by Julian the apostate
[1:16:59] and dismissed again by him when he saw
[1:17:03] him unconquerable. Now, Julian tried one
[1:17:08] thing and another and another and he
[1:17:11] finally just had to let this brother go
[1:17:13] cuz he was unconquerable. Now, I want
[1:17:16] you to notice that Rufenus tells us that
[1:17:19] he met this martyr a long time after
[1:17:23] this trial and he asked him whether the
[1:17:27] pain he felt were not insufferable. He
[1:17:31] answered that at first it was somewhat
[1:17:35] grievous.
[1:17:38] Wow. Somewhat grievous.
[1:17:41] But after a while there seemed to Oh,
[1:17:45] thank you, Lord. There seemed to stand
[1:17:48] by him a young man in white
[1:17:53] who with a soft and comfortable
[1:17:57] handkerchief wiped off the sweat of his
[1:18:00] body which through extreme pain and
[1:18:03] anguish was little less than blood.
[1:18:07] So this angel standing there with a soft
[1:18:10] handkerchief is wiping off this sweat
[1:18:14] which had become of a mixture of blood
[1:18:17] and bade him be of good cheer in so much
[1:18:22] as that it was rather a punishment than
[1:18:26] a pleasure for him to be taken
[1:18:30] off the rack.
[1:18:34] How many knows what the rack was? Few of
[1:18:37] you.
[1:18:39] All right. It was a long type of wooden
[1:18:43] table.
[1:18:44] They would lay you down on the rack.
[1:18:46] They would have places for your arms,
[1:18:49] places for your legs, sometimes places
[1:18:52] for your torso where they could tie you
[1:18:54] down. They would have a crank on this
[1:18:57] end where your legs were. They'd have
[1:19:00] another crank on this end. And they
[1:19:01] would tie your arms over your head like
[1:19:04] this. And they would tie your legs down.
[1:19:06] And they would start cranking. And they
[1:19:09] would crank and crank until you started
[1:19:13] screaming and hollering. And some of
[1:19:16] them they would pull their their arms
[1:19:19] and their legs out of joint. But if they
[1:19:22] did not recent and deny the Lord Jesus,
[1:19:25] they would keep pulling until they would
[1:19:28] pull their hands off of their arm or
[1:19:33] they would pull a foot off of their leg
[1:19:37] or so dislocate the hips that the legs
[1:19:41] would be pulled out of the sockets and
[1:19:43] the arms as well. Now, can you imagine a
[1:19:46] man receiving such divine comfort from
[1:19:50] an angelic being that he says it was
[1:19:54] actually torment
[1:19:56] to be took off the rack.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:20:03] In so much as that it was rather a
[1:20:06] punishment than a pleasure to him to be
[1:20:09] taken off the rack. since when the
[1:20:12] tormeners had done the angel was gone.
[1:20:18] Now notice, so the angel of God was sent
[1:20:22] down to this brother, you know, I mean,
[1:20:24] I've heard brother Random say, and
[1:20:26] whenever he preached, what was it, the
[1:20:27] third seal, I think, and he he set a box
[1:20:31] up on the on the uh platform there, the
[1:20:33] pull pit, and he set a box and he said,
[1:20:35] "I'm going to set this year to represent
[1:20:37] that." Now, what he was doing was
[1:20:38] preaching about an anointing for each
[1:20:41] church age. And he was talking about the
[1:20:43] martyrs and the things that they went
[1:20:45] through. And he said, "I I'll set this
[1:20:47] up here to represent that." And he said,
[1:20:49] "That's what they worked under." So the
[1:20:52] anointing of the first age and the
[1:20:54] second and the third and then of course
[1:20:56] we're under the seventh. But and I
[1:20:59] wondered about that, you know, h how did
[1:21:01] it work exactly that it it gave them
[1:21:04] strength, no doubt, and it gave them the
[1:21:06] ability to go through it. But it it
[1:21:08] never clicked to me personally. Maybe
[1:21:10] you already I'm slow sometimes. But
[1:21:12] whenever I read this account, it made it
[1:21:16] so much more real to me, brother Harvey,
[1:21:18] that God not only had an anointing that
[1:21:20] was upon the church, but God would send
[1:21:23] angels down there. Now, there's many
[1:21:25] more stories in Fox's book of martyrs.
[1:21:27] And what makes it amazing to me is that
[1:21:29] even the Roman emperors and those that
[1:21:31] would kill these saints of God. The
[1:21:34] great marvel was not how many dead that
[1:21:36] they raised and how many sick that they
[1:21:38] heal. one Roman writer after another,
[1:21:42] one after another. It was not just the
[1:21:45] signs of the supernatural that they took
[1:21:47] note of, but it's how they loved one
[1:21:51] another. And it wasn't just how much
[1:21:54] they loved Jesus. It was how much they
[1:21:57] loved one another. Oh my, preach,
[1:22:00] Brother Donnie. And yet we claim we have
[1:22:03] more than they did.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. But you think now
[1:22:09] that the angel of God was sent down
[1:22:11] there now to the tormentors who this was
[1:22:14] their profession. So this is what they
[1:22:17] did. You imagine they knew with so many
[1:22:20] cranks a normal human being on their
[1:22:22] right arm, their left arm, you know,
[1:22:24] their leg, whatever. A normal human
[1:22:26] being, they're going to break right
[1:22:27] there. And this brother just kept right
[1:22:29] on cranking. He just kept right on going
[1:22:32] and them cranking and cranking and
[1:22:34] cranking. And they're sitting there
[1:22:35] thinking, "What in the world? Can you
[1:22:37] believe what? I ain't never seen nothing
[1:22:38] like this in my entire life. I mean, you
[1:22:41] would think, well, what's such a big
[1:22:42] deal? Well, if this is your job all day
[1:22:44] long, popping people's shoulders and
[1:22:46] pulling their hips out and all that sort
[1:22:48] of thing and you're standing there and
[1:22:49] you done got this guy cranked to the max
[1:22:51] and he just lay there, glory, glory,
[1:22:54] glory.
[1:22:55] Somebody touch me. Glory, glory, glory.
[1:23:00] And these people s say, "What in the
[1:23:02] world is going on?" And they took it to
[1:23:05] its max and then they had to crank him
[1:23:07] down and crank him down. And when they
[1:23:09] cranked him down, the angel of God left
[1:23:12] and they they sent message back up to
[1:23:14] this apostate guy and told him, "We've
[1:23:17] done cranked the thing as far as we can
[1:23:19] go. We don't know what else to do."
[1:23:20] Said, "Well, just let him go." But they
[1:23:22] finally got him back again. What was it?
[1:23:25] An angel that was sent to minister to
[1:23:28] our brother.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, you and I more than likely
[1:23:32] will never be put upon the wrath. But in
[1:23:35] one way, we face things more difficult
[1:23:37] in this day than what they did then. Now
[1:23:41] watch, let us look in Luke 1 11 at
[1:23:44] angelic visits. I just picked a few out
[1:23:46] of the scripture. Luke 1 7 11. And it
[1:23:50] was an angel that was standing at
[1:23:53] Zachcharias right hand. And there
[1:23:55] appeared unto him an angel of the Lord.
[1:23:57] I want you to notice it does not
[1:23:59] categorize this angel as the angel of
[1:24:03] the Lord. The angel of the Lord. Several
[1:24:06] occurrences in the Old Testament
[1:24:09] describes this certain angelic
[1:24:11] appearance as the angel of the Lord.
[1:24:14] This is not the angel of the Lord, but
[1:24:17] an angel of the Lord. Now notice, there
[1:24:20] appeared unto him an angel of the Lord
[1:24:22] standing in on the right side of the
[1:24:26] altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw
[1:24:28] him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon
[1:24:32] him. But the angel said unto him, Fear
[1:24:34] not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard,
[1:24:37] and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a
[1:24:40] son, and thou shalt call his name John,
[1:24:43] and thou shalt have joy and gladness,
[1:24:45] and many shall rejoice at his birth. I
[1:24:47] want you to notice what this angel does.
[1:24:50] So he calms him because of this
[1:24:53] supernatural visitation. But he also
[1:24:55] brings him a message that is going to
[1:24:58] affect him and many many more people as
[1:25:02] well. They will rejoice at his birth.
[1:25:05] But Satan also appears in a very similar
[1:25:08] way. Read Corinthians Zechariah 3:1. and
[1:25:12] he showed me Joshua the high priest
[1:25:15] standing before the angel of the Lord
[1:25:20] and Satan
[1:25:22] standing at his right hand to resist
[1:25:24] him. So here is Joshua the high priest
[1:25:28] standing right before the angel of the
[1:25:32] Lord. The angel of the Lord. Not an
[1:25:37] angel but the angel of the Lord. Who is
[1:25:40] it? Christ, pre-incarnate Christ, the
[1:25:44] angel of the Lord. Now notice, he's
[1:25:47] right there in front of it and he looks
[1:25:49] over there and sees in this supernatural
[1:25:52] occurrence and Satan was standing at his
[1:25:54] right hand.
[1:25:57] You mean Satan would stand that close,
[1:26:01] that close to the angel of the Lord?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And what is he there for? It said
[1:26:09] standing at his right hand to resist him
[1:26:14] and the Lord. Now it tells us who that
[1:26:16] angel was. And the Lord said unto Satan,
[1:26:21] the Lord rebuked thee. Notice it's not
[1:26:24] capital L, small O, small R, small D,
[1:26:27] but capital L, capital O, capital R,
[1:26:29] capital D. So it's God's name
[1:26:32] represented by his person. The Lord
[1:26:36] rebuke thee, oh Satan, even the Lord
[1:26:41] that hath chosen Jerusalem.
[1:26:44] Rebuke thee? Is not this a brand plucked
[1:26:48] out of the fire? Now Joshua was clothed
[1:26:51] with filthy garments, and stood before
[1:26:55] the angel. And he answered and spake
[1:26:57] unto those that stood before him, said,
[1:27:00] Take away the filthy garments from him.
[1:27:03] And unto him he said, "Behold, I have
[1:27:05] caused thine iniquity to pass from thee,
[1:27:09] and I will clothe thee with change of
[1:27:12] raignment." Now, who did this? Not the
[1:27:14] devil. The devil would want him to keep
[1:27:16] them old rags on because it produced a
[1:27:20] sense of uncleanness in the presence of
[1:27:24] God. But Satan loves that sort of thing.
[1:27:27] When children of God become defiled,
[1:27:30] whenever they become cold or indifferent
[1:27:33] and they get things in their life, Satan
[1:27:35] loves that. Oh, but it grieves the
[1:27:37] spirit of God. He cannot send it. He
[1:27:39] does not love that sing sort of thing at
[1:27:40] all. So, he said the angel of God is
[1:27:44] going to bring a clean change of
[1:27:48] clothes.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, guess what? If you
[1:27:54] didn't get what the angel brought, you
[1:27:56] still had on your dirty garments.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; I wonder if the seventh angel's message
[1:28:01] is going to be the same way in the last
[1:28:03] day. God sends another message with an
[1:28:06] angel, a divine presence to be able to
[1:28:09] back it up. Now notice, and I said, "Let
[1:28:12] him set a fair minor upon his head." So
[1:28:15] they set a fire matter upon his head and
[1:28:18] clothed him with garments and the angel
[1:28:20] of the Lord stood by.
[1:28:24] Time to crown somebody. So the angel of
[1:28:28] the Lord is watching over. Look also in
[1:28:30] Daniel 9 21. Yay. While I was speaking
[1:28:34] in prayer,
[1:28:36] even the man Gabriel
[1:28:40] whom I had seen in the vision at the
[1:28:42] beginning being caused to fly swiftly
[1:28:46] touch me about the time of the evening
[1:28:50] oblation.
[1:28:51] And he informed me
[1:28:56] and talked with me. Now notice what
[1:28:59] these angels did.
[1:29:01] They would bring bits of information.
[1:29:05] They did not reveal everything
[1:29:08] especially to prophets. But it's like
[1:29:11] God would send an angel with a key to
[1:29:14] the prophet and the prophet would have
[1:29:17] an entrance or a door opened up in the
[1:29:20] supernatural realm. Then that brought
[1:29:22] the prophet into the divine place where
[1:29:25] he needed to be cuz this is God's
[1:29:27] mouthpiece on the earth, his prophet.
[1:29:30] Then once the angel opens the door, the
[1:29:33] an the angel of God could do that. But
[1:29:36] the angel of God could not be the
[1:29:38] prophesy. It must be a man on the earth.
[1:29:42] So he opens the doorway for the prophet
[1:29:45] Daniel. And then Daniel walks in and he
[1:29:48] informed me and talked with me and said,
[1:29:51] "Oh Daniel, I am now come forth to give
[1:29:54] thee skill
[1:29:57] and understand him."
[1:30:01] And you know what Daniel was doing? He
[1:30:03] didn't stand up there and say, "Now I
[1:30:05] I'm saying what Jeremiah said. Just
[1:30:07] stand up and and quote Jeremiah chapter
[1:30:09] 1, chapter 2, chapter 3, chapter 4,
[1:30:11] chapter 5, chapter 6, and on down
[1:30:12] through 40, whatever it is there." and
[1:30:14] just said, "I'm saying what Jeremiah
[1:30:16] said. I I'm saying what the other
[1:30:18] brothers said. I ain't got nothing to
[1:30:19] say cuz I'm just saying what they say."
[1:30:21] And Daniel actually said things that
[1:30:23] Jeremiah didn't say. That's why God has
[1:30:25] a prophet on the earth cuz he has
[1:30:27] something that he's got to say for the
[1:30:30] time that he sends the prophet. And if
[1:30:32] God sends him, it's very important.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; "So now watch." So the angels of God,
[1:30:41] they're sent to bring an open doorway.
[1:30:45] They are sent to bring and impart a
[1:30:48] message to the heavenly recipient. Then
[1:30:51] that that that heavenly recipient will
[1:30:53] come down and he will bring that message
[1:30:55] then to the earthly messenger and the
[1:30:59] earthly messenger will in turn bring it
[1:31:00] to the people. Now notice Gabriel did
[1:31:03] not go to every Jew in this land. He did
[1:31:08] not go to every one of them. Neither did
[1:31:10] the angel of the Lord appear to
[1:31:12] everybody under the administration of
[1:31:14] Joshua the high priest. But he came to
[1:31:16] the high priest alone. And then Joshua
[1:31:19] went to tell everybody else. So the
[1:31:21] angel of the Lord Gabriel came down to
[1:31:24] Daniel, anointed Daniel. Then Daniel was
[1:31:28] supposed to write it down. And Daniel
[1:31:30] was the one that shared the revelation
[1:31:32] with the people in his age. You
[1:31:34] understand?
[1:31:36] Now, this is not a pastor. This is not a
[1:31:39] bishop. This is not a just a good person
[1:31:41] that studied the Bible. No, God chooses
[1:31:44] who he wants to reveal these things to.
[1:31:47] I thank God for it myself. Don't you?
[1:31:49] But then there's other times when these
[1:31:51] angels would appear and they would
[1:31:54] minister not so much a new understanding
[1:31:58] or clarity of a word that already been
[1:32:01] said but actually strength
[1:32:06] just strength
[1:32:08] divine energy
[1:32:10] trying to energize you. Now watch in
[1:32:14] Luke chap 22 verse 43.
[1:32:18] And there appeared, this is the Lord
[1:32:21] Jesus, an angel unto him. Notice this
[1:32:25] time, by himself.
[1:32:28] So there's not several. One angel comes,
[1:32:33] and notice what he does. Now, there
[1:32:35] appeared an angel unto him from heaven
[1:32:39] strengthening.
[1:32:41] Not ministering.
[1:32:43] Not ministering.
[1:32:45] Strengthen him.
[1:32:48] Strengthen him.
[1:32:51] So this angel is coming to try to bring
[1:32:56] a strength that will add to the
[1:32:59] remaining strengths the Lord Jesus has
[1:33:02] left.
[1:33:04] Now, keep in mind that this is not just
[1:33:06] him, the son of God alone, but he's the
[1:33:10] head of the new race. He's setting up
[1:33:13] the type for his children. So, when you
[1:33:17] and I get in the garden, we'll never be,
[1:33:20] of course, like he was, but we get in
[1:33:22] our tests and our trials, and it seems
[1:33:24] as if though our strength is gone. I'm
[1:33:28] convinced, friends, God has sent us
[1:33:31] angels in our life.
[1:33:33] angels of God from another realm and
[1:33:36] just something happened to you.
[1:33:39] Something moved for you and your family.
[1:33:41] You didn't see it. Maybe you didn't feel
[1:33:43] anything, but there was just something
[1:33:46] that happened. And from that time, it's
[1:33:49] like you got a strength that you didn't
[1:33:51] have before. How many said it's happened
[1:33:53] to you?
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; And there appeared an angel unto him
[1:33:57] from heaven strengthening him. Now man
[1:34:02] at the first was tempted by a fallen
[1:34:06] angel. So the temptations which will
[1:34:10] occur in our life and the numerous
[1:34:13] allurements and things that Satan will
[1:34:15] put before us or discouragements or
[1:34:18] whatever it is. Who do you figure is
[1:34:20] doing that? Well, it can't be these
[1:34:22] three realms up here. They're ordained
[1:34:24] to encourage us. So it's from the same
[1:34:27] source that Adam and Eve were tempted
[1:34:30] from in the beginning. So from the dark
[1:34:32] side down below our realm of time here
[1:34:35] on this dark side of malignancy and
[1:34:38] death and unbelief and opposition and
[1:34:41] darkness what is it? Fallen angels.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Now if God would open our eyes tonight
[1:34:49] and let us look around this building.
[1:34:53] This building is full
[1:34:57] of angels.
[1:35:00] both good and bad.
[1:35:03] I mentioned it over at the camp, but
[1:35:06] brother Brandham talked about when he
[1:35:09] would cast out demons out of people,
[1:35:12] those demons would follow his meetings.
[1:35:17] So, say he was in Minneapolis and then
[1:35:21] thousands of people got delivered. Well,
[1:35:24] unless they picked up a new house where
[1:35:28] they were there in the Minneapolis
[1:35:30] meetings, they would follow him to the
[1:35:33] next location, wherever that was. We'll
[1:35:36] say Louisville, Kentucky.
[1:35:38] So then demons would actually go to that
[1:35:42] next meeting.
[1:35:45] You say, "Why in the world would David
[1:35:46] do that?"
[1:35:48] Because church depending on the church
[1:35:51] of course is a good place to pick up
[1:35:54] devils.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Now it can be manufactured of course by
[1:36:00] the church or by the preacher or by
[1:36:03] people who are getting them cast out and
[1:36:07] you sat there and doubt and question and
[1:36:10] that's all it takes. Now I mentioned it
[1:36:12] to the youth over there and some of our
[1:36:14] youth were there. But if a person
[1:36:16] brother Joe just by doubting a promise
[1:36:20] and and you remember brother Brandham
[1:36:22] telling about the church of Christ man
[1:36:23] and his people that sat around the table
[1:36:26] and he was going to come up and try to
[1:36:27] trick brother Brandon and whenever he
[1:36:29] walks up there hands him a prayer card.
[1:36:31] And you know brother Brandham read the
[1:36:33] prayer card and the man was getting
[1:36:35] ready to expose him. So he thought and
[1:36:37] he thought that brother Random had a
[1:36:39] trick going. But before he could ever
[1:36:41] pull his trick, Brother Random told him,
[1:36:43] "I see you and 28 of your people sitting
[1:36:46] doing so and so and so. Now every one of
[1:36:49] you have got what you wrote on your
[1:36:51] prayer card. Cancer, TB, all kinds of
[1:36:55] things." Now what happened? The demon of
[1:36:58] cancer, the demon of TB,
[1:37:02] the demon of whatever more entered into
[1:37:06] those people right then
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; because of what? Their unbelief.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think then if if a
[1:37:15] person would disbelieve and could pick
[1:37:18] up a fallen spirit like that, what in
[1:37:22] the world has taken us 47 years to get
[1:37:25] the Holy Ghost?
[1:37:28] Why in the world if people can get a
[1:37:30] demon like that and get it that quick?
[1:37:32] Now you imagine when brother Random
[1:37:34] would cast out epilepsy. He said that
[1:37:36] was the only one that would get away
[1:37:39] from him. Now he would tell the people
[1:37:42] to be silent, to be respectful to God,
[1:37:44] bow their heads, and be real reverent.
[1:37:46] That was a word that he used over and
[1:37:48] over again. Why? Because that spirit's
[1:37:50] going to leave. And when that epileptic
[1:37:53] devil would go out, he's looking for a
[1:37:55] house. He's looking for a house. Or a
[1:37:59] who at Word of Life don't like the
[1:38:01] sermons tonight. Who at Word of Life is
[1:38:03] mad? Who at Word of Life is not living
[1:38:05] right? They're they're they're sneaking
[1:38:07] around a little bit and doing this and
[1:38:08] that and the other. You imagine you go
[1:38:09] to church to hear the words. You go to
[1:38:12] church to clap your hands and sing. and
[1:38:14] you go there and you're sitting there
[1:38:15] with unbelief or an attitude and the
[1:38:17] spirit leaves somebody and you walk out
[1:38:20] of there with a demon.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Going to church is serious, ain't it?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Having the right attitude serious.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Now think of it then. God knew that
[1:38:36] there would be these righteous angels,
[1:38:39] elect angels which he could use to
[1:38:42] influence, strengthen, help his people.
[1:38:45] So they're the pure ones and they have
[1:38:48] this divine ability, but no doubt
[1:38:51] they're limited. They cannot preach. Of
[1:38:53] course, they do a much better job than
[1:38:55] any preacher. You ain't never heard a
[1:38:56] perfect preacher yet. Never will. But
[1:38:58] these fallen malignant fellow angels,
[1:39:02] they try to come and bring us down and
[1:39:06] wear us out as Daniel said they do. And
[1:39:09] troubles and worries and fears and
[1:39:11] anxieties right here in this place
[1:39:14] tonight. There's a warfare.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are here at their post
[1:39:23] of duty.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; You know where it's at.
[1:39:28] You know where their post of duty is?
[1:39:31] Standing by you saints.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Now they're not just on the pulpit. Even
[1:39:37] though they're here,
[1:39:39] they was not just with brother Brandham,
[1:39:43] but they are here to support us to
[1:39:47] strengthen us. So the angels of God can
[1:39:52] support us in affliction. But remember,
[1:39:56] there's certain conditions in your home
[1:40:00] that are required for the angels to feel
[1:40:03] welcome.
[1:40:05] Homes that read and pray, read the Bible
[1:40:08] and pray and live close to God.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of homes angels can
[1:40:14] visit. That's the kind of homes we want,
[1:40:15] is it not?
[1:40:17] Now notice they bring they bring
[1:40:20] comfort. Whenever the Lord Jesus
[1:40:23] ascended up to heaven in Acts chapter
[1:40:24] 1:9, "And when he had spoken these
[1:40:27] things, while they beheld, he was taken
[1:40:30] up, and a cloud received him out of
[1:40:32] their sight. And while they looked
[1:40:34] steadfastly toward the heaven, as he
[1:40:38] went up, behold, two men stood by them
[1:40:43] in white apparel, which also said, you
[1:40:47] men of Galilee, I stand you gazing up
[1:40:50] into the heaven. This same Jesus which
[1:40:53] is taken up from you into heaven shall
[1:40:55] come in like manner as you have seen him
[1:40:58] go into heaven. Now, why are they
[1:41:01] therefore? to bring comfort. Can you
[1:41:03] imagine how sad they are? Jesus has been
[1:41:05] telling them over and over again, "Boys,
[1:41:07] I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm tell you,
[1:41:08] I'm leaving." And now at hand, Brother
[1:41:10] Matthew, they realize, "Oh no. Oh no.
[1:41:12] He's leaving. We won't see him again. We
[1:41:14] won't we won't see him again."
[1:41:17] Uh-huh.
[1:41:18] Maybe like some of our loved ones.
[1:41:23] And what did God do?
[1:41:26] Hallelujah.
[1:41:29] Send angels down there.
[1:41:32] Not to bring Jesus back, but to comfort
[1:41:35] him until he come back.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Can I have just a few more minutes?
[1:41:41] Amen.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Now, the angels of God
[1:41:46] don't just help us in our journey as
[1:41:49] Christians,
[1:41:51] but one of the important parts of their
[1:41:54] call and their vocation
[1:41:59] is when they get ready to leave this
[1:42:00] world.
[1:42:03] Luke 16:22.
[1:42:06] And it came to pass
[1:42:10] that the beggar died
[1:42:13] and was carried
[1:42:15] by the angels
[1:42:18] into Abraham's bosom.
[1:42:20] And the rich man also died
[1:42:24] and was buried. Did you ever notice in
[1:42:26] reading that verse,
[1:42:28] it doesn't say that the beggar was even
[1:42:32] buried?
[1:42:34] Do you understand? For some of the
[1:42:36] extreme poor people, they didn't even
[1:42:38] bury him.
[1:42:41] They'd throw him out in the barren land.
[1:42:43] The jackals, whatever more, would eat
[1:42:45] them.
[1:42:47] The beggar was so poor, he didn't even
[1:42:51] have enough money put back for a funeral
[1:42:54] service.
[1:42:57] But I want you to notice the difference
[1:43:00] in their departure. And it came to pass
[1:43:02] that the beggar died and was carried by
[1:43:05] the angels into Abraham's bosom. The
[1:43:09] rich man also died
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; and was buried,
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; not carried
[1:43:17] by angels.
[1:43:20] Now, I know it's a realm that we know so
[1:43:22] little about.
[1:43:24] Now, keep in mind when you're studying
[1:43:26] of our passing
[1:43:29] and merging from time over into eternity
[1:43:32] and especially when you're listening to
[1:43:33] brother Brandham tell about the dreams
[1:43:37] and then tell about the experience that
[1:43:39] beyond the curtain of time.
[1:43:41] Now remember in the dream it was he sees
[1:43:46] his daughter.
[1:43:48] He sees out west and he sees a a broken
[1:43:51] wheel, a wagon wheel. You remember that?
[1:43:53] That was his family circle that was
[1:43:55] broken. And then he's walking down this
[1:43:58] road and he sees this beautiful young
[1:44:02] woman
[1:44:04] and he walks by her
[1:44:07] and she says, "Hello, daddy."
[1:44:10] And he turns around and looks at her and
[1:44:12] says, "Ma'am,
[1:44:14] how could I be your daddy when you're as
[1:44:17] old as I am?"
[1:44:19] He said, "Daddy, don't you know me in
[1:44:22] Earth? I was your little daughter,
[1:44:24] Sharon Rose."
[1:44:28] He said, "Daddy,
[1:44:30] little babies, there are no little
[1:44:32] babies here. They don't get old.
[1:44:36] They don't age."
[1:44:38] Everybody's one age up there.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Broke into the fountain of youth, ain't
[1:44:42] we?
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Ain't no old people invited
[1:44:46] to that meeting. It's youth youth
[1:44:48] meeting for eternity.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Now she he stops in the dream and talks
[1:44:55] to her and she tells him, "Mama,
[1:45:01] mama's on up at your house. You got a
[1:45:05] new house." He said, "New house."
[1:45:08] I said, "Brandom don't we don't live in
[1:45:10] a house. We're vagabonds."
[1:45:13] This is his word now, life story.
[1:45:14] Vagabonds.
[1:45:17] He said, "Well, mama mama's waiting for
[1:45:19] you." Well, he said, "You coming along?"
[1:45:21] Said, "No,
[1:45:23] I'm saying you're waiting for Billy."
[1:45:27] So when he walks up and he sees this
[1:45:30] this house
[1:45:33] and hope comes out to meet him.
[1:45:38] Now you know what what can be confusing
[1:45:40] to people is when he goes beyond the
[1:45:43] curtain of time
[1:45:45] into the sixth dimension
[1:45:48] his wife comes to him and says my
[1:45:51] precious brother. Yeah.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; And people think in their mind that's
[1:45:56] what eternity will be.
[1:45:59] But remember the sixth dimension is not
[1:46:02] the seventh.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; It's only a holding place.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; You will know as you are known.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Jim is not going to be a hello
[1:46:12] brother. Sister Linda.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Calvin won't be a hello brother.
[1:46:18] Sister Barbara,
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; remember when he went beyond the curtain
[1:46:24] of time, he actually did not die to get
[1:46:28] there.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; So God interrupted the natural process
[1:46:33] for him to show him and translate him
[1:46:37] over there so he did not come by the way
[1:46:39] of death. So he does not mention angels
[1:46:42] packing him because he didn't die.
[1:46:47] Hallelujah.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:46:54] So, in the sixth dimension, people that
[1:46:56] are there, it's not like that husbands
[1:46:59] and wives are holding hands and running
[1:47:01] around there in the sixth dimension,
[1:47:03] it's it's a special place where it's
[1:47:06] brother, sister, brother, sister. But
[1:47:09] when he was carried up there had the
[1:47:11] dream, then what did he see?
[1:47:14] He saw what he said that heaven would be
[1:47:17] some years later a continuation of this
[1:47:21] same life.
[1:47:24] So you see if you by God's grace got
[1:47:29] your perfect mate in this life ought to
[1:47:32] be thanking God every day of your life
[1:47:34] if that happened to you. And it's not
[1:47:36] like that when you get there, y'all will
[1:47:39] just pass and say, "Hi, brother." And
[1:47:42] he'll look over at you, "Hello, sister."
[1:47:45] No,
[1:47:47] the sixth dimension was a special place
[1:47:50] for people who have not yet entered into
[1:47:52] the glorified bodies. You remember they
[1:47:54] told him, he said, he's curious. He
[1:47:56] said, "Do y'all eat here?
[1:48:00] Do y'all eat here? Or are these
[1:48:02] Brandhams?" You see, he had not yet
[1:48:04] become the word. Had he died, he would
[1:48:06] have entered into the word foreign body.
[1:48:09] He wouldn't have been asking them
[1:48:10] questions. He'd already know the
[1:48:11] answers. Death would have burst him into
[1:48:14] the answers.
[1:48:16] But he was translated up there. So he's
[1:48:18] asking all these questions. Well, these
[1:48:20] are your the you've been joined with
[1:48:22] your people. Oh, these are Brandhams.
[1:48:25] These are not Brandhams. These are your
[1:48:28] converts that you've led to Christ. But
[1:48:30] you see, didn't know. Don't you know
[1:48:32] that? Don't you know that beautiful
[1:48:34] woman? You was admiring her. Don't you
[1:48:36] remember her? No, I don't remember. You
[1:48:38] led her to Christ when she was past 90.
[1:48:42] So he did not know all things. So
[1:48:45] therefore, in the sixth dimension, they
[1:48:47] said, "No, we don't eat here, but one
[1:48:49] day you'll be judged.
[1:48:52] And if you're accepted,
[1:48:55] and you will be,
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; that's where I hang my soul, brother,
[1:48:59] sister, following the message of the
[1:49:02] hour. Now, for those of you who want to
[1:49:04] pull me away, uh when was the last visit
[1:49:07] you had to the sixth dimension? Come and
[1:49:08] tell me and we'll sit down and talk. But
[1:49:11] until you do, I'm going to follow a man
[1:49:13] who's been there.
[1:49:17] Well, I don't believe it. I don't care
[1:49:19] what you believe or don't believe. That
[1:49:20] has no effect on me.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; I believe it it to be the truth.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Now notice while there the angels of
[1:49:30] God, he doesn't mention sing them.
[1:49:34] He doesn't mention sing the zoons. He
[1:49:37] was not allowed to see Jesus.
[1:49:39] So the sixth dimension, even though it's
[1:49:42] sublime and perfect, but what did they
[1:49:45] tell him? This is what you preached
[1:49:48] was the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:53] Perfect love.
[1:49:57] And so I thought I I I've got to make
[1:50:00] everybody come here. I I've got to do
[1:50:02] whatever I want to do. And and he
[1:50:04] started feeling this funny feeling. He
[1:50:06] was moving on the body on the bed. Now
[1:50:08] remember, he wasn't but 20 feet
[1:50:12] from his body.
[1:50:15] and he saw his body moving and he said,
[1:50:17] "No, no,
[1:50:20] no. Don't tell me I've got to go back.
[1:50:23] Thank God he come back."
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; And remember, this is 1960. The seals
[1:50:30] hadn't been preached yet. There's a lot
[1:50:32] more stuff, Brother Jack. It had to be
[1:50:33] done. Why is it that God allowed our
[1:50:37] messenger to go? I I can't say I have
[1:50:39] the answer to that, but I'm just so glad
[1:50:41] that he did. When Paul went up there,
[1:50:43] Paul saw things he couldn't even tell
[1:50:45] what he ever saw. Luther never did go.
[1:50:47] Wesley never did go. The old blinded
[1:50:50] colored guy that had the the one eye
[1:50:52] that's really bad kind of the founder of
[1:50:54] the Isuza street move. He never went.
[1:50:56] Wonder why God wanted to send our
[1:50:58] messenger over there and come back,
[1:51:00] brother Skippa, and let us know. We must
[1:51:02] have needed encouragement about that
[1:51:05] realm and what it's like.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I want you to notice now and
[1:51:12] we'll close.
[1:51:14] So no grave,
[1:51:17] no funeral.
[1:51:20] He might not have had a friend in this
[1:51:22] life.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; The poor beggar,
[1:51:30] but now not one
[1:51:33] but plural angels
[1:51:36] come to pack him to Abraham's bosom. And
[1:51:39] remember, Abraham's bosom was not up
[1:51:41] this way then cuz Jesus hadn't died. So
[1:51:45] it was down this way, kept there. Not in
[1:51:47] the regions of the lost, but kept their
[1:51:50] next is called paradise.
[1:51:53] Maybe people wouldn't even speak to him.
[1:51:56] But his passing meant so much in this
[1:51:58] parable that God dispatched angels.
[1:52:03] You realize all of our loved ones that
[1:52:05] have been ready to go and meet the Lord
[1:52:07] Jesus. We might not have seen them. Oh,
[1:52:10] I've stood by the bed of many of them,
[1:52:13] held their hands, wept with them, their
[1:52:15] family,
[1:52:16] and you can feel it. Oh, yeah. You can
[1:52:18] definitely feel it. That presence and
[1:52:21] something comes in like a wind sometimes
[1:52:23] and
[1:52:25] they're gone.
[1:52:28] Oh, praise God.
[1:52:32] For you see,
[1:52:38] when you broke forth from the womb,
[1:52:42] an angel identified itself with you.
[1:52:47] And when you took the first breath of
[1:52:50] life,
[1:52:52] there was an angelic spirit hanging
[1:52:55] around your mother.
[1:52:58] which was your angel.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; We'll pick it up next time.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you a little appetizer.
[1:53:17] Brothers, jump down to question answers
[1:53:18] 1964. Explain about each person's angel
[1:53:22] who abides with them from birth.
[1:53:25] Now, if you notice,
[1:53:27] this is pretty deep.
[1:53:31] Now, he talks a lot, so I I went down
[1:53:32] through there and cut part of this out.
[1:53:34] If you want to read the whole thing, you
[1:53:35] can. Now, it isn't promised
[1:53:39] that sinners
[1:53:42] has angels.
[1:53:44] It's only the redeemed
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; that has angels.
[1:53:50] Did you know that the angels of the Lord
[1:53:52] encamp about those that fear him? Angels
[1:53:55] are messengers. I want you to notice
[1:53:57] it's so perfect and it'll prove
[1:54:00] predestination to you.
[1:54:04] Now, while this little body is being
[1:54:06] formed, the little natural body being
[1:54:08] formed in the mother,
[1:54:11] there is a spiritual body of the earth
[1:54:14] ready to receive this natural body as
[1:54:17] soon as it is born. Now the baby is born
[1:54:20] with live muscles, a beating heart, but
[1:54:23] no breath of life in it.
[1:54:27] Its muscles twitching. See, then there
[1:54:29] was something different from that.
[1:54:32] If there wasn't a spirit that come into
[1:54:34] it later, then our breaths could leave
[1:54:37] us and we would breathe no more and
[1:54:39] still be alive. But when this body
[1:54:41] doesn't receive oxygen or breath, intake
[1:54:45] and outtake of our lungs, then we're
[1:54:46] dead.
[1:54:48] Notice a mother. She could be ever so
[1:54:50] mean and cruel, but just before that
[1:54:52] baby's born, there's a certain kindness
[1:54:55] that sets in. Did you ever notice a
[1:54:57] mother when she's to be mother, there's
[1:54:59] something sweet about her. She takes on
[1:55:02] that sweetness.
[1:55:04] It's because that little angel,
[1:55:08] that little spirit, a little messenger
[1:55:12] to this little tabernacle
[1:55:16] is ready to come forth into the world.
[1:55:20] Then when this little angel comes into
[1:55:23] the body,
[1:55:25] it's a little angel of the earth,
[1:55:28] a spirit that's ordained of God to take
[1:55:32] this body. Then that baby has to have a
[1:55:36] choice.
[1:55:37] It makes its decision.
[1:55:40] Then when this takes place, then you see
[1:55:45] the angel of the Lord
[1:55:48] now comes in here
[1:55:51] which is a spiritual body
[1:55:54] that eternal.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:56:04] Well, brother Donnie, I've got a
[1:56:05] different opinion from that. Well, I'll
[1:56:06] tell you what. After you've had angelic
[1:56:08] visions, you've raised the dead, you've
[1:56:10] cast out devils, you've stomped storms,
[1:56:11] you've done all the things that he's
[1:56:13] done, come save me.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; But until that happens, I'm going to
[1:56:17] keep on preaching this.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Now, this is a dying spirit and a dying
[1:56:24] body. Now, you can't be in two bodies at
[1:56:27] one time,
[1:56:29] but there can be two natures in you.
[1:56:33] at one time.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:56:40] So whatever you have need of here
[1:56:42] tonight, saints,
[1:56:45] every time we enter into church, the war
[1:56:48] is set.
[1:56:50] The angels of God are here trying to
[1:56:54] energize.
[1:56:56] The word was the prophet that the
[1:56:57] prophet used.
[1:56:59] He even said it in question answers that
[1:57:01] your own glorified condition, your angel
[1:57:06] is here in the tabernacle this morning
[1:57:10] trying to send a charge through you like
[1:57:15] a battery.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; You ever crank your old car?
[1:57:26] That's the way the poor song leader is.
[1:57:28] He getting up here.
[1:57:34] It helps so much if y'all if nothing
[1:57:35] else be like the Flintstonones. Put your
[1:57:37] feet down and push this car and make it
[1:57:39] go. At least clap your hands. Do
[1:57:41] something.
[1:57:45] Children, how many times
[1:57:47] have we been in the house of God around
[1:57:49] other saints of God and their angels
[1:57:51] were also there and we walked in so low
[1:57:54] and so despondent
[1:57:57] and we walked out of their feelings so
[1:57:58] different. Maybe didn't feel one thing
[1:58:00] on our flesh, but something happened to
[1:58:03] us.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; God sent your glorified condition
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; to get close enough to you to hook up
[1:58:11] the jumper cables.
[1:58:13] and just say, "Stand still long enough."
[1:58:15] And there you were.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; I believe I can make it.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Jesus.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Life is good.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; And God is good.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; What was it? Your body come near you cuz
[1:58:37] you're so low
[1:58:40] and you needed a charge.
[1:58:46] Don't you love him?
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you is in that state
[1:58:51] tonight.
[1:58:54] The angels of God are here. The angels
[1:58:57] of darkness are also here. They're here
[1:58:59] and they're saying, "Keep him from
[1:59:02] believing. Keep him from believing."
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Tell them to watch the clock. 5:30 comes
[1:59:09] early in the morning. You may not even
[1:59:11] see 5:30 in the morning.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; This on your mind, that on your mind.
[1:59:15] The angel of God saying, "Listen, be
[1:59:17] attentive, have faith, believe, trust."
[1:59:21] What are they doing? Building faith,
[1:59:24] trying to energize you to get you to
[1:59:26] that place so they can simply open the
[1:59:28] door and you walk into your miracle.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:59:35] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads with no one looking
[1:59:39] around, please.
[1:59:41] How many has a need tonight in your
[1:59:42] life? Physical, spiritual, financial,
[1:59:46] whatever it is, trouble in your home,
[1:59:48] trouble at your work, trouble your
[1:59:50] school,
[1:59:52] you believe Jesus is mindful of you.
[1:59:56] Do you believe the angels of God can go
[1:59:58] with you, young people that are in the
[2:00:00] university? You believe the angel of God
[2:00:02] can go with you at your medical office
[2:00:04] where you work, whatever it is that you
[2:00:07] do? Sure they can. Now, think of it. The
[2:00:11] Bible, the way the Bible says it is that
[2:00:14] they camp about you. Brother Ram said
[2:00:16] they don't come and go and quoting the
[2:00:18] scripture. They're with you all the
[2:00:21] time.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; They camp near you.
[2:00:27] It's their personal charge from Almighty
[2:00:29] God.
[2:00:33] If you have a need tonight, would you
[2:00:35] just raise your hand there before the
[2:00:36] Lord? Lord, be mindful of me. You see
[2:00:38] what I have need of. Maybe yours is not
[2:00:40] so much your own personal need. Maybe
[2:00:43] it's your wife, maybe your son, your
[2:00:45] daughter, a business transaction you're
[2:00:48] facing tomorrow. Whatever it is,
[2:00:52] praise God,
[2:00:55] Lord Jesus,
[2:00:57] as we bow our heads to the dust of the
[2:01:00] earth from whence these bodies were
[2:01:01] taken.
[2:01:04] But we're so grateful that a great
[2:01:06] transformation has happened
[2:01:09] since our bodies left the earth.
[2:01:13] I'm so glad when my mama
[2:01:16] was packing me.
[2:01:19] Her and daddy both just kids themselves,
[2:01:22] married a little over a year, 18 and 19.
[2:01:27] Mama was already a sweet person anyway.
[2:01:32] But no doubt when it come close time for
[2:01:35] me to be born.
[2:01:38] Lord, that little shack used to stand on
[2:01:40] the side of the Purdue Road, which was a
[2:01:43] gravel road. I've drove by there many
[2:01:45] times after mom and daddy told me that I
[2:01:48] was brought home from the hospital
[2:01:51] there.
[2:01:53] Holes in the walls,
[2:01:57] but that didn't hinder the angel from
[2:02:00] coming around. Thank God.
[2:02:04] Lord Jesus, how many times have I been
[2:02:07] in spots and I thought, my my how am I
[2:02:11] going to get out of this
[2:02:13] and suddenly a way was made? No doubt it
[2:02:17] was the angel of the Lord.
[2:02:20] I hope people will leave this place
[2:02:22] tonight and those that'll stream it and
[2:02:24] go to thinking back in their lives.
[2:02:27] Would you bring it back to their memory?
[2:02:29] this event and that event and other
[2:02:31] events when the angel of God might have
[2:02:34] been sitting in a doctor's room when
[2:02:36] they had just heard a terrible, terrible
[2:02:37] report from an MRI or a CT scan and all
[2:02:42] of a sudden a presence just enveloped
[2:02:46] them and the fear of the word cancer
[2:02:49] left them right there in the doctor's
[2:02:51] office.
[2:02:53] Praise God. Lord, I believe your angels
[2:02:57] can still come to bring encouragement
[2:02:58] tonight, Father.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm doing pretty good myself right
[2:03:03] now. I'm not too low. And Lord, I'm not
[2:03:06] going through a whole lot of things
[2:03:07] right now in life.
[2:03:10] So, Father, I pray for my brothers and
[2:03:12] sisters with all of my heart.
[2:03:15] Oh God, that you'd minister to them.
[2:03:19] Help them tonight. Father, I pray to
[2:03:21] realize they don't need their pastor
[2:03:25] to pray for them every time they're down
[2:03:27] and weary,
[2:03:29] but if they could understand all they
[2:03:32] need to do is come to you
[2:03:35] and ask you to charge their angel.
[2:03:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:43] To give them strength and minister to
[2:03:46] them and helps them. May they realize if
[2:03:50] I'm a thousand miles from here, if I'm
[2:03:53] in New Zealand or South Africa, wherever
[2:03:55] I'm at,
[2:03:57] their angel didn't fly on that plane
[2:03:59] with me.
[2:04:01] Their angel is still with them. Father,
[2:04:04] if we could get this, it would bring
[2:04:06] such a calm when our babies break out
[2:04:09] with fever, when storms hit our lives.
[2:04:14] It would bring such a calm and an
[2:04:16] assurance in our heart that the angels
[2:04:19] of the Lord are here in our home.
[2:04:25] When Jacob that day met
[2:04:28] the angel of God
[2:04:30] and after that visitation,
[2:04:33] Jacob called the name of that place
[2:04:37] Mayanim.
[2:04:40] May Hanahan,
[2:04:43] the camp of the two hosts.
[2:04:48] Two host,
[2:04:51] his earthly one and your heavenly one.
[2:04:56] But both of them merged together in one
[2:04:58] name.
[2:05:00] May an
[2:05:03] may our church, may our homes,
[2:05:07] may it be similar to the same thing.
[2:05:09] Lord,
[2:05:11] we are the host of the Lord, the earthly
[2:05:13] host. But around us,
[2:05:17] there's a great servant prophet whenever
[2:05:19] he stood there and the servant was so
[2:05:20] afraid and he said, "Oh, master, master,
[2:05:23] look at there, how many there are
[2:05:25] chariots and horsemen and all." He said,
[2:05:26] "Lord God, open up this boy's eyes." And
[2:05:30] he looked around and he saw horses as
[2:05:32] fire and chariots of fire, angels
[2:05:35] setting everywhere. And he said,
[2:05:37] "There's more with us than they are with
[2:05:40] them.
[2:05:42] We may feel outnumbered in this world, a
[2:05:44] bunch of blind, wretched, naked
[2:05:47] Leodysans.
[2:05:49] But open our eyes tonight, Father, and
[2:05:51] let us see there's way more of us than
[2:05:53] they are with them."
[2:05:55] Hallelujah.
[2:05:57] We worship you tonight, Lord God.
[2:06:01] I believe your angels are at their post
[2:06:05] of duty,
[2:06:07] standing near your saints.
[2:06:11] Minister now, Father, to your children,
[2:06:13] I pray
[2:06:15] in the name of Jesus.
[2:06:19] Sing something for us. Hey, can we just
[2:06:21] worship now a little bit before before
[2:06:23] we go?
[2:06:24] Still a little bit early yet. So, just a
[2:06:26] few minutes before 9. I won't keep you
[2:06:28] too long.
[2:06:30] But if you could only look around this
[2:06:32] place and see who's here.
[2:06:36] See who's here.
[2:06:39] What beings
[2:06:41] were here when you come in and what
[2:06:44] beings come in with you?
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:52] Hallelujah.
[2:06:55] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:58] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Father, we do not believe in angel
[2:07:04] worship.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; We worship only you,
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; but we believe they are at our disposal.
[2:07:12] Father,
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; may the angels of the Lord pass through
[2:07:16] this congregation tonight.
[2:07:21] medicine, the weary,
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; the closing us.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Granted, I pray for them.
[2:07:29] Lord, I pray for Elelliana home sick
[2:07:31] tonight. Father, they want to be in
[2:07:33] church.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God to her tonight, Lord.
[2:07:38] And now
[2:07:41] I know
[2:07:44] in the name of Jesus he touch me
[2:07:49] and
[2:07:51] leave me home.
[2:07:55] Well, let's worship him now.

[2:08:01] by
[2:08:05] fever.
[2:08:11] I was beneath
[2:08:14] the Lord of tears
[2:08:18] and she

[2:17:18] more days
[2:17:21] to labor.
[2:17:24] Oh, thank God.

[2:19:51] circle the earth with bowed heads as
[2:19:54] we're singing about redemption and grace
[2:19:57] and mercy cuz they don't understand what
[2:20:00] we're singing about."
[2:20:02] What a day that'll be, friends.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Can we sing together Amazing Grace
[2:20:07] before we go? Don't you appreciate grace

[2:25:15] Jerusalem.
[2:25:19] Just a little nugget for you to think
[2:25:21] about as you're driving home.
[2:25:24] Angels get no reward.
[2:25:29] Angels
[2:25:31] get no crown
[2:25:35] of all they've went through, of all
[2:25:37] they've dealt with for thousands of
[2:25:39] years. And the scripture me mentions no
[2:25:42] reward,
[2:25:46] no crown set upon their head.
[2:25:49] You get the reward.
[2:25:52] You get the crown.
[2:25:58] When the battle's over, we shall wear a
[2:26:03] crown.
[2:26:05] [Music]
[2:26:07] Oh, we shall wear a crown.
[2:26:11] When the battle's over,
