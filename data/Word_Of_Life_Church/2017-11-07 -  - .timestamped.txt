[7:52] requests this morning we like this guy
[7:54] right here don't we hey you meant
[8:01] um forgive me if I'm wrong about who it
[8:05] was but I think it was I think it was
[8:08] Khrushchev whenever he would even speak
[8:11] in their version of Parliament or
[8:14] Congress whatever it is they have over
[8:15] there in Russia they were so afraid of
[8:18] him he had so much power and they were
[8:22] so afraid of him
[8:23] that nobody wanted to be the last one or
[8:26] the first one to quit clapping when he
[8:28] would come into the room they would
[8:30] stand there and they would clap and clap
[8:31] and clap and they were scared to death
[8:33] to be the first one to stop because they
[8:36] were so afraid of this man I'm rather
[8:38] Lully this morning was asking us to give
[8:40] a hand clap or praise I was thinking we
[8:42] serve a God who loves us so much who
[8:49] gave us everything who humbled himself
[8:52] when he didn't have to down to the
[8:54] lowest of us to save us to to show us
[8:57] his kindness to show us his mercy and
[8:59] His grace and and you know I didn't it's
[9:03] overwhelming when we clap
[9:05] it's worship we don't we don't want to
[9:08] stop because we love Him not because
[9:10] we're afraid he'll strike us down if we
[9:11] quit we're so fortunate to be the people
[9:14] of God we're so fortunate to have the
[9:16] revelation we've got you know even even
[9:18] when the devil comes against us as hard
[9:20] as he can when he when he brings the
[9:21] blindfold the sickness against us and
[9:23] discouragement and just tries to wail on
[9:26] to some beat us down when he tries to
[9:28] put that blindfold on us and blind us
[9:31] from our faith all of our senses tell us
[9:34] that that he's not there that he doesn't
[9:35] love us that he doesn't care everything
[9:37] within us cries out saying where are you
[9:40] God where are you but but that seat down
[9:42] inside of us at faith that he gave us it
[9:44] reaches out and it says blessed be the
[9:46] name of the Lord blessed be the name of

[46:49] the children of Israel these men are the
[46:53] tribe of Reuben Simeon and Judas and it
[46:56] goes on these men were great leaders

[47:02] congregation look up Jew when these men
[47:04] walk up to the podium people gave them
[47:07] great respect people Reavis them because

[54:43] members if you could just go out there
[54:45] and do your Lilian chant man amen get
[54:48] them to a place when it started getting
[54:50] cold
[54:51] - Walter message if you could just do
[54:53] anything to slow down and I can imagine
[54:56] Balaam went out there and he did all his
[54:58] Lilian chant minute he did all that
[55:00] little stuff ain't man and you know what
[55:02] the children kept praising God hey man
[55:05] the children kept worshiping God they
[55:08] come to church with a wheelchair but it
[55:10] still with praising God someone would

[55:15] praising God and you know what Balaam

[55:20] thing just ain't working and be like God
[55:24] and be like got upset look here now I
[55:27] normally I paid you and you can handle
[55:30] this job but Balaam told him he said
[55:32] look God is not a man that each alive
[55:35] neither he the son of man that he shall
[55:38] repent if God ever speaks something God
[55:41] can't lie
[55:44] that's that's what keeps me going
[55:46] because my Lord promised me there will
[55:49] be a rapture
[55:50] oh god promises true better yet the
[55:56] Apostle Paul said in Thessalonians he
[55:59] said the Lord himself shall descend from
[56:02] heaven with a shout with the voice of an
[56:06] archangel we're not looking for that
[56:08] promise it has already come and we are
[56:11] part of that promise I'm not looking for
[56:16] a shop I'm not looking for a boy we are
[56:18] the voice in a day now the dead in
[56:23] Christ it's going to rise first and we
[56:25] that alive and remain a man you know a
[56:28] lot of folks they're looking for they
[56:30] meant that prayer direction but let me
[56:33] tell you you got to be a part of the
[56:35] resurrection you got to be a part of the
[56:40] shouts are you hearing me you got to be
[56:42] excited to see my loss you've got to be
[56:45] looking for him if you're not looking
[56:47] for him then you're not going to see him
[56:51] that word did like me pleasing somebody
[56:57] someone that's greatly great pleasure
[57:01] happy see delight and I said Lord is it
[57:06] okay for me to title if the Lord if you
[57:10] said today know if in the bride where
[57:12] Paul said if that spirit if that spirit
[57:17] that raised Christ from the day if that
[57:21] spirit but if that spirit
[57:23] if that spirit
[57:26] if so in other words that's a
[57:29] possibility that spirit may not be there
[57:33] that's why I say that's very that raised
[57:37] Christ from the day if that's varied
[57:39] welling you it's going to quicken you
[57:42] what do you think it's quicken you
[57:44] it's a reveal word of the hour not what
[57:47] Luther preached not what TD jakes freeze
[57:50] not what tommy here or in adults it's
[57:53] the message of the hour it's healed the
[57:55] bride rapture faith it give us

[1:08:09] they got all these information it may
[1:08:11] look a real good before the people real
[1:08:13] good it's just packing all this and that
[1:08:16] he man it got old and then when they got
[1:08:18] down there see now if you notice here
[1:08:21] let's turn here I'm just I'm just
[1:08:23] falling low let's turn to Exodus the 3rd
[1:08:26] chapter a man
[1:08:28] Exodus a man Exodus when it was coming
[1:08:31] out of Egypt not look what God told them
[1:08:34] it man this wasn't Moses that said this
[1:08:36] this was God God can't lie Exodus 3 and
[1:08:42] verse 6 and it read I'm over here he
[1:08:47] said I am the God of thy father the God
[1:08:50] of Abraham the god of Isaac a God of
[1:08:53] Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was
[1:08:58] afraid to look upon God now this was God
[1:09:02] speaking in a different form a man God
[1:09:04] from the turn of Spirit a man when God
[1:09:07] took on a form the low gods that came
[1:09:09] out of God and God was that color fire
[1:09:12] that stood before Moses here in Moses
[1:09:15] look Moses couldn't even look in his
[1:09:17] face now this was God talking to Moses
[1:09:21] this wasn't a quote that Moses read this
[1:09:24] was God verse 7 and the Lord said I have
[1:09:30] surely seen the affliction of my people
[1:09:33] are in Egypt and they in other word God
[1:09:37] said I see those folks in those system a
[1:09:39] man
[1:09:40] those my people in those systems and
[1:09:44] that's what he said but he said if my
[1:09:47] people that are called by my name if
[1:09:50] they were
[1:09:50] humming themself seek my face and turn
[1:09:53] from their wicked way then I'll yield
[1:09:56] their land you know what a lot of lands
[1:09:58] in he'll cut people ain't turning now
[1:10:03] let me share something with you while
[1:10:05] I'm thinking of this young a pardon me
[1:10:06] I'm just falling the Holy Spirit would
[1:10:08] that be all right hey man I just thought
[1:10:11] of this right here a man the property
[1:10:13] God made a statement right here he says
[1:10:15] I will get back to accident-free man to
[1:10:18] Lord's will but look coming out of Egypt
[1:10:20] not eaten as I said Egypt was a type of
[1:10:23] the world or an organization now you've
[1:10:26] got many of the children of Israel he
[1:10:29] may came out of Egypt but when they come
[1:10:31] out of Egypt they come out of Egypt are
[1:10:34] you hearing me when it left Egypt was a
[1:10:36] type of justification are you with me
[1:10:39] they went through Red Sea was a type of
[1:10:42] sanctification sanctification is clean
[1:10:46] and set aside first servant I'm afraid a
[1:10:49] lot of folks got no father
[1:10:51] then sanctification that little clean

[1:19:44] I know it must have shocked them then
[1:19:46] they knew there was a man didn't believe
[1:19:48] but yet Moses say look God told you me
[1:19:50] to tell you God to go down there I don't

[1:46:22] for 34 years I worked on a construction
[1:46:25] job some years ago and there was a man
[1:46:29] on an i-beam early in the morning why
[1:46:31] the dude was still on the i-beam he was
[1:46:34] up there demanding his guys to go out
[1:46:36] there early in the morning with the dew
[1:46:37] was on the beam they didn't want to go
[1:46:39] out there he called him a bunch of
[1:46:41] chickens a bunch of sissies and he said
[1:46:44] I'll go out there and put that steel
[1:46:46] together and he walked out there and he
[1:46:49] fall down to his death and let me tell
[1:46:51] you what I walked by this man saw him
[1:46:54] laying on the ground I looked at the man
[1:46:58] with my own eyes laying on the ground
[1:47:00] and it was command everybody to leave
[1:47:04] the jobsite and when he fell I looked
[1:47:06] like go I could see his members I'd see
[1:47:09] that his team-mate crying because he
[1:47:13] thought he was too good to go out there
[1:47:16] and he fell to his death but that night
[1:47:21] that night they gave them the wife a
[1:47:24] sudden my two daughters to keep it quiet
[1:47:26] are you hearing me but that night I went
[1:47:29] news they said two men up on me a man on
[1:47:34] the job Herbert Jurgen and so-and-so
[1:47:37] fell between two safety net brother I
[1:47:41] saw with my own wife that wasn't a
[1:47:43] safety net no way around so you mean to
[1:47:49] tell me when the prophets say he saw
[1:47:51] sixteen men fell you think that company
[1:47:55] would have let that out
[1:47:58] you think they would have let that out I
[1:48:01] don't know
[1:48:02] i had--my ever been to Charleston you
[1:48:05] see that big bridge when you cross over
[1:48:07] just been built a few years ago I cross
[1:48:09] that bridge I have a little part of it
[1:48:11] let me tell you what there was means
[1:48:13] wide it was pouring concrete there was
[1:48:16] man that was out of town there was man
[1:48:19] that wasn't look up to but at nighttime
[1:48:22] the crane operator say he heard means
[1:48:24] when he fell in the water
[1:48:25] but they kept on pouring that concrete
[1:48:27] they say no records of it just keep it
[1:48:30] quiet so you think when the Prophet said
[1:48:33] God showed him 16 that's what he saw and
[1:48:36] that's what I believe I believe the
[1:48:43] report I believe the report can I can I
[1:48:47] give you one more can I give you one
[1:48:49] thought I'm going to show you hot dog
[1:48:51] amen
[1:48:52] cuddles me discomfort the people ha it
[1:48:55] got so bad until they say you know what
[1:48:58] we would that we stayed in Egypt Paul
[1:49:01] said in Galatians 2 and 18 amen if I
[1:49:04] build again the things that I discard I
[1:49:06] make it myself for what a transgressor I
[1:49:12] was on the job

[1:49:21] but see there's a darkness you know
[1:49:24] somebody say brother children don't
[1:49:26] touch your little saying that people
[1:49:28] don't need to know that if you got a
[1:49:29] Internet you already seen it five six
[1:49:33] years ago we might want to talk about
[1:49:35] but it's everywhere but I want to tell
[1:49:37] to believe us amen
[1:49:39] we got our eyes on one thing and there's
[1:49:42] a rap shot there there's a catch aware
[1:49:44] of the church a man I'm not going to die
[1:49:47] what moves has told us Moses say the
[1:49:49] land was falling making honey
[1:49:51] and joseline Kayla said we gonna fight
[1:49:53] every inch of the way we going all the
[1:49:56] way we fought over vision and the land
[1:49:58] was flowing with milk and honey

[1:50:15] and 33 on the Ohio River Bridge are you
[1:50:18] oh are you with me and in my study I
[1:50:21] need to get some inspiration kind of
[1:50:23] when I read something a man I could see
[1:50:25] what the Prophet said I'm Sheamus you
[1:50:28] don't do it
[1:50:28] that's your Bend as a man but he was my
[1:50:30] property man he wasn't my Savior he
[1:50:33] didn't die for me amen
[1:50:35] but Jesus died for me but he was Malachi
[1:50:38] 4 and brother I was sitting at my death
[1:50:46] trying to get an inspiration and I said
[1:50:48] I believe I'll just type and I type in
[1:50:51] the Ohio River Bridge and when I did
[1:50:53] that to my surprise brother seemed like
[1:50:56] it got dark on me and none to my
[1:50:59] surprise it was so that he wasn't even
[1:51:02] out there are you with me
[1:51:06] he wasn't even out there matter of fact
[1:51:09] some of the people wasn't out there like
[1:51:11] he said yeah say my god is that true I
[1:51:15] said Lord this can't be and you know
[1:51:17] what I got away from my computer and I

[1:51:22] car and I rolled down to another section
[1:51:25] that's oh my god and seeing that doctor
[1:51:27] was covering over me

[1:51:30] darkness with it a man you got to be
[1:51:33] tough in this out if you're not built to
[1:51:35] take it in this hour the best thing you
[1:51:37] do is this hit the altar because their
[1:51:39] Lord I need a Holy Ghost in the south to
[1:51:42] meet the challenge of the devil brother
[1:51:48] I got alone to myself and I knew I had
[1:51:51] something that need to be taken care
[1:51:52] that day and I was trusting God I would
[1:51:55] be with what God said but probably God
[1:51:57] said if you take it and put it in the
[1:52:00] acts of 19 child it'll come to pass
[1:52:03] oh my god what like 19 chapter got to do
[1:52:07] with that if he said I believe it but
[1:52:12] that day I saw him a golf car and the
[1:52:14] darkness was coming over me that devil
[1:52:17] says see you believe in all this Amen
[1:52:19] you believe in all that so all that
[1:52:21] stuff be real it's just like a man with
[1:52:24] them 12 when I'm teeing came back with
[1:52:26] the evil report all that ain't true
[1:52:27] that's a god you got to help me
[1:52:30] I said lord I believe it was all my
[1:52:32] heart I said God show me outside the
[1:52:34] Lord I know you with me I said God prove
[1:52:37] yourself and brother than when I was
[1:52:39] sitting there about twenty geese flew
[1:52:42] over my head in a v-shape and when they
[1:52:45] get flew on my head
[1:52:46] a revelation struck and I say oh my god
[1:52:49] I say you know what what make those
[1:52:51] birds stage an air like that there's a
[1:52:53] law within the bird to make them stay
[1:52:56] there but go against gravity
[1:52:58] I said law you put a law within my mouth
[1:53:01] I can speak to my dog and dogs got to go
[1:53:04] I said lord I believe that this message
[1:53:07] it's just says the Lord I believe in
[1:53:10] 1933 I believe
[1:53:15] if the law if the law delighting us if
[1:53:22] the law brother if the laws you know
[1:53:26] when I make that statement I said if the
[1:53:28] Lord is pleased with you if the Lord is
[1:53:30] pleased with you ain't the law don't
[1:53:33] look at your phone
[1:53:34] I sure hope God is pleased with me don't
[1:53:38] worry about that
[1:53:39] if you come from God God is pleased with

[1:53:44] God looking at his self God it give God
[1:53:49] pleasure to look at himself
