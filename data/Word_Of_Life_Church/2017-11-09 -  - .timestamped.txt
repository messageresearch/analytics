[22:58] it's always kind of hard to get up and
[22:59] sing a new song when you know there's no
[23:02] lyrics there's no foundation to it so
[23:07] this song is for the ministers that

[23:17] hearing problem so when I was little I
[23:19] start I'll learn to read people's lips

[23:32] kind of made him you know like a hotdog
[23:37] preacher you could say you know they

[23:57] he's always serving steak I always eat
[24:01] steak here I've been here for two years

[24:20] places my heart goes out for them now

[35:38] it's my responsibility to see the Sheep
[35:40] or fed whether I do it or not one Martin
[35:44] whenever I'm gone and I hear disparate
[35:47] fruits and that one and generally I'll
[35:49] get them back over and over again if you
[35:53] all enjoy them I don't hear very good
[35:58] comments I'm probably not going to get
[36:01] them back were often sorry just the way
[36:07] it is
[36:08] so preachers that don't get called back
[36:11] don't get mad at me because you're not a
[36:14] blessing after Valley we just don't go
[36:17] the other way here so if you want to
[36:20] come back
[36:21] feed them feed them good
[36:31] praise the Lord so we're happy to be be
[36:35] back tonight I got a little plea this
[36:40] week from someone who needed some
[36:43] financial assistance it was kind of a
[36:49] different type of request and what I
[36:51] normally get we get all types of
[36:54] requests for financial assistance from
[36:56] people overseas but this one was from my
[36:59] father and it was kind of twofold
[37:02] because he wanted me to announce his
[37:05] daughter's engagement to a young men
[37:08] here in the church and then he had an
[37:11] association with that that there would
[37:13] be a great debt incurred he felt like on
[37:16] his part so he wanted us to maybe
[37:19] consider lifting an offering for the
[37:21] poor the poor Oh dad
[37:30] sister le Garvin and brother Robert
[37:32] mcaren got engaged so both Charles is
[37:37] your face 14 shades of red you know so
[37:45] we want to congratulate them
[37:46] let's give my dear wife render them
[37:57] apparently before church so she sent me
[37:59] a text while I was sitting back in the
[38:00] office setting and said you ought to see
[38:03] her ring it is so beautiful I felt
[38:07] typical woman she said they want you to
[38:13] announce it tonight okay all right so
[38:17] I'd also like to announce that there's a
[38:20] wedding supper that's being planned all
[38:26] of you I hope are invited now I can't
[38:30] actually invite you the list was already
[38:33] made before the foundation of the world
[38:35] but I do believe I'm preaching to people
[38:38] who were pre invited don't you want to
[38:43] go listen to Matthew chapter 16 if you
[38:47] would tonight we'd like to look again at
[38:55] this little little thought on the church
[38:59] if the Lord will help us when Jesus came
[39:04] into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he
[39:07] asked his disciples saying whom do men
[39:12] say that I the Son of Man am and they
[39:18] said some say thou are John the Baptist
[39:20] some Elias others Jeremias or one of the
[39:25] prophets he saith unto them but whom say
[39:30] ye that I am and Simon Peter answered
[39:34] and said thou art the Christ the Son of
[39:39] the Living God
[39:41] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[39:44] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[39:48] blood has not revealed it unto thee but
[39:50] my father which is in heaven
[39:53] also I say unto thee thou art little
[39:58] rock Petra and upon this big rock I will
[40:05] build my church which is not on Peter as
[40:08] we know and the gates of Hell shall not
[40:12] prevail against it Hemme believes that
[40:18] then if you are part of that church
[40:20] there is nothing that Hale can do to
[40:24] destroy this break together
[40:30] how many I'd like to be remembered
[40:31] before the Lord tonight just raise your
[40:33] hand out many needs visible and those
[40:36] that are streaming as well Heavenly
[40:39] Father as we come into your presence
[40:41] tonight Lord we are such a they blessed
[40:44] people God I thank you for grace I thank
[40:48] you for your mercy I thank you for our
[40:51] church I thank you for a place that we
[40:53] can come to Lord and to be able to hear
[40:55] the word Lord I get texts and emails and
[40:59] phone calls from people all over this
[41:02] world that Lord the church situation and
[41:05] their home it's awful Lord many of them
[41:08] have to try to sort through this church
[41:11] and that church this one's off the word
[41:13] but they worship this ones more on the
[41:16] word but they're dead this one's got a
[41:18] double married preacher this one's got
[41:20] this and I think Lord Jesus how grateful
[41:24] we ought to be
[41:25] to be able to come to the house of God
[41:28] and hear the word preached and to watch
[41:31] you discern our very hearts our very
[41:34] thoughts you the word Lord that places
[41:37] you right among us I pray we would never
[41:40] take it for granted father I pray
[41:42] Heavenly Father this prayer cost that I
[41:44] have Lord the sister berry you see her
[41:47] need Lord Jesus they streamed the
[41:49] service no doubt our tonight I pray the
[41:51] presence of God would just go with this
[41:53] cloth we know Lord that this is
[41:56] scriptural we know that and father we
[41:58] are not Elijah nor Paul but you are
[42:01] still Jesus so as our preach tonight the
[42:04] anointing comes to anoint me I pray
[42:06] Heavenly Father would go with this cough
[42:08] as well these hands that rep lifted
[42:10] signify the need or request we pray to
[42:13] not that you'd meet them may you speak
[42:16] to us through the channel of your word
[42:17] tonight it's in the name of the word we
[42:19] ask the Lord Jesus and the Saints said
[42:23] god bless you since you may be seated
[42:30] let's read this verse 18 again and all I
[42:33] say also unto thee thou art Peter and
[42:36] upon this rock I will build my ecclesia
[42:41] let's look at the meaning of the word
[42:43] assembly a gathering of citizens called
[42:47] out from their homes into some public
[42:51] place an assembly of Christians gathered
[42:55] for worship
[42:57] we've not gathered here tonight to see
[42:59] one another's clothes
[43:01] we've not gathered here tonight just to
[43:04] hear pretty singing nice music we've
[43:07] gathered for worship and this is also a
[43:09] house of Correction the literal meaning
[43:14] of church is a called out assembly the
[43:19] word is used 114 times in the New
[43:22] Testament 90 of these times refer to a
[43:27] local assembly the other times of course
[43:29] are referring to the ecclesia part which
[43:33] is the mystical body we know that we
[43:38] become the member of a church very easy
[43:42] you go to an assembly somewhere you're
[43:45] baptized in water by the pastor by one
[43:49] of the Deacons you say I want to put my
[43:51] name on the book they write your name
[43:53] down there give you the dues the don'ts
[43:56] the wherefore is the wise you become a
[43:58] member of that church now that's much
[44:01] easier to do than it is to become a
[44:04] member of the body of Christ because
[44:07] remember now when Jesus says this word
[44:11] there was no church as of yet now there
[44:16] was a tie or a symbol of the church in
[44:20] the Old Testament and we know that
[44:22] Israel represented that but there was no
[44:26] New Testament church as of yet so when
[44:29] they heard Jesus say this they would
[44:32] have thought something totally different
[44:34] than what you and I think as we came to
[44:38] church tonight no doubt you passed
[44:40] several buildings the sign out front
[44:42] said so-and-so church so-and-so church
[44:45] so-and-so church so-and-so Church so
[44:49] when you and I hear the word church we
[44:52] may not take it in a too complimentary
[44:54] way if someone tells us or calls us
[44:58] Church we almost become offended by
[45:01] because we prefer to be called bride but
[45:06] now remember in looking at it in the New
[45:09] Testament terms when you look at the
[45:11] ecclesia it's exactly the same thing but
[45:16] the bride is an advancement of what the
[45:19] church is so what is it all about
[45:21] position and relativity to the Godhead
[45:25] in the son of man it's the way that we
[45:28] relate to our position in Christ Jesus
[45:32] now remember that Jesus did not ask them
[45:35] who do people say I the son of David am
[45:39] or who did
[45:41] say I the Son of God am but who do they
[45:46] say i the son of man am now in this day
[45:54] most of our churches talk about him
[45:56] being the son of God no doubt many would
[46:00] talk about him being the son of David
[46:03] what sets us apart we identify him not
[46:07] only in those two positions but we
[46:10] cherish his position as son of a man why
[46:15] because this is a position that he chose
[46:19] to reveal himself again in the last day
[46:22] to the Gentiles and may I say your
[46:27] prophet said that he's chosen to
[46:29] identify himself in the body of his
[46:33] bride in the form of the Son of Man he
[46:37] said in my flesh and in yours praise the
[46:43] Lord
[46:44] so who do you say that the son of man is
[46:47] all about a rider brother Ram see you're
[46:50] off right there that's as far as your
[46:53] understanding has let you go about who
[46:56] the Son of Man is this is why many the
[46:59] message folks need a reappearing again
[47:02] of brother Branham in order to usher in
[47:05] the resurrection so they believe me to
[47:08] them believe that brother Branham will
[47:09] have a private resurrection first that
[47:13] he will raise from the dead first then
[47:16] he will call the resurrection I have a
[47:21] problem with that you know Paul did not
[47:24] say that they would be brother Branham
[47:27] brother Branham did not say it would be
[47:30] brother Ram
[47:31] [Applause]
[47:33] the Lord himself shall descend from
[47:37] heaven with a shout Amen the Lord
[47:42] Himself not a prophet not a pastor not a
[47:46] church hates messenger but the Lord
[47:48] himself a man now because our relation
[47:55] to him is identified by a dispensational
[47:58] office and a dispensation of claim we
[48:02] must find our own claim upon him in
[48:05] order to tap into the power that lies in
[48:08] the revelation of the word by the
[48:10] revealing of his person it's now God
[48:13] chose to reveal himself in the churches
[48:16] of course in a sevenfold personage of
[48:19] his being that person is is selective of
[48:23] his own choice by which he has chosen to
[48:26] reveal himself he could not have made
[48:29] himself known in the days of loser in
[48:32] the same light that he's revealed now
[48:34] now you know that we just had the five
[48:37] hundredth year of the Reformation
[48:40] whenever Luther attacked this 95 theses
[48:43] up on the door of Wittenberg Germany and
[48:45] me of the Protestants have now rejoiced
[48:48] with him pass the church sign today that
[48:50] they were celebrating it was a
[48:52] Protestant Church and they were
[48:53] celebrating when Luther had done this
[48:55] but but the Tim Milan that sitting in
[48:57] article by Larry McGee some different
[48:59] brothers and they was going through
[49:01] looking on the Catholic Church and the
[49:03] Protestants had said well we've been
[49:04] able to come together and reach some
[49:07] sort of agreement and we've been able to
[49:10] move beyond these differences that we've
[49:12] had for 500 years are they still
[49:15] disagree of course on the Holy Eucharist
[49:17] they disagree on many many things that
[49:19] they found one principle that most of
[49:22] them can agree on and you know what it
[49:24] is the Trinity
[49:26] that's what they said they said that
[49:30] they all can agree on the Trinity once
[49:35] again you're the odd duck a man once
[49:39] again you are left out of their
[49:42] agreement now that cannot agree on
[49:44] communion they cannot agree on marry
[49:46] they cannot agree on intersection they
[49:48] cannot agree on many many things but
[49:50] they've been able after all of these
[49:52] years whenever loser protested and
[49:54] remember loser was as much a trinitarian
[49:57] when he came out of the Catholic Church
[49:59] as he was when he was in it he wants to
[50:02] try to change souls Wesley so as many of
[50:04] these men but the evening light of the
[50:07] Godhead of Christ was too reserved to
[50:10] the last day
[50:11] remember the soul of Solomon it was not
[50:14] three standing at the door knocking of
[50:16] his war
[50:16] that's exactly right John said he saw
[50:19] one on the throne and let me tell you
[50:21] something if there's another sitting on
[50:23] the throne he's sitting on the floor cuz
[50:25] John only saw one for all there's only
[50:28] one on the throne and God said in the
[50:30] Old Testament there is none other beside
[50:33] me if there is he said I am the first
[50:43] that's part of the revelation of his
[50:46] being in the last day you will never see
[50:50] your own place until first he you can
[50:52] see him properly in his part of the
[50:55] restoration of the entire message is to
[50:57] bring Christ to his position in order to
[51:00] bring you to your seeing Christ in his
[51:02] by the random in his and you and your
[51:04] show me somebody that does not see
[51:06] Christ in his place nine times out of
[51:09] ten by Dennis Lee brother Wrentham right
[51:10] I'm more than likely they don't see
[51:12] themself right but if you can see cross
[51:14] right first then see by the brand right
[51:16] then you're on the right road of success
[51:18] and to seeing yourself right why because
[51:21] that is God's order we live in the day
[51:24] when the evening
[51:25] Shyne don't you thank God for it now
[51:28] look Jesus is addressing the ecclesia
[51:31] the called out and he asked them who do
[51:34] men say well they say you're this out of
[51:36] the other all right now let me bring it
[51:37] on down who do you say that I have now
[51:41] Peter responds because of the revelation
[51:44] that God had dropped his heart remember
[51:46] the appearing of the Son of Man is
[51:48] always an identification of man of God
[51:51] blending together a son of man what does
[51:53] how sees I see a scroll
[51:55] Daniel son of man Jeremiah son of man so
[51:58] what was it deity on the earth in a form
[52:01] by which the people would be able to
[52:03] relay Jesus came on the earth and he
[52:06] identified himself over and over again
[52:08] as what son of man and you must reappear
[52:12] again in the last day as what son of man
[52:15] he revealed himself in the form of son
[52:18] of God which is baptism of the Holy
[52:20] Ghost
[52:21] but the fullness of the attribute of God
[52:23] wants to return in the last days you see
[52:27] Luther could still remain the
[52:28] Trinitarian smoke a pipe and drink a
[52:31] little bit of beer on the side typical
[52:34] German in the 15th 16th century well she
[52:37] could be able to do this add the other
[52:38] Pentecostals could shout the shoe heels
[52:40] all baptized and Titus and believe in
[52:43] three gods but you won't be able to do
[52:45] it because the light shining brighter
[52:46] and is shining brighter about what the
[52:49] Holy Roman Catholic Church no this is
[52:52] shining brighter but Reformation or it's
[52:54] shining bright about the person of the
[52:56] Lord Jesus then we should not be amazed
[52:59] that the devil the very devil that the
[53:02] Spirit of God struck against by the
[53:04] prophet of God will try to come right
[53:06] back around
[53:07] at this message and Rob the deity away
[53:10] from Jesus Christ by message preachers
[53:13] an idiom born-again their self all
[53:18] friends I've said it for years and years
[53:20] and I'm going to keep on saying it one
[53:22] of the reason we've got so many errors
[53:23] and so many false Saints in this church
[53:25] the church around the message is because
[53:27] we got preachers send it behind the
[53:29] pulpit but they ain't born again
[53:31] what are you doing to preach with me we
[53:34] got preachers standing in the pulpit
[53:35] that are not born again they're not
[53:37] filled with the Holy Ghost they need not
[53:39] them but just converting Lutheran's or
[53:40] Methodists or Church of Christ
[53:42] but if we can get some of these matches
[53:44] preachers really born again you talking
[53:46] about breaking up revival you're talking
[53:49] about having the Word of God come and
[53:50] stir our soul but it's got to begin with
[53:53] the preacher himself oh my how and where
[53:57] did I get off from there now what's this
[54:00] in the Laodicean Church age book now by
[54:03] his Spirit he is creating many sons unto
[54:05] himself God the creates or creating
[54:08] himself a part of his creation this is
[54:11] the true revelation of God this was his
[54:14] purpose this purpose took form through
[54:17] election that is why he could look right
[54:20] down to the last stage when all would be
[54:23] over and see himself still in the midst
[54:27] of the church as also of this new
[54:30] creation of God his sovereign power
[54:32] brought it to pass oh you say brother
[54:36] Donny I made up my mind baloney you
[54:38] never done no such a thing I don't care
[54:43] who it is from a prophet to a pastor
[54:45] down to a wash woman there ain't none of
[54:47] us got enough strength to be able to
[54:50] make up our mind over the powers of this
[54:52] day friends we are leaving living in a
[54:55] day when darkness is around us
[54:57] everywhere you heard it this week a man
[54:59] stepping into a church in killing 26
[55:01] people that same thing else around
[55:04] everywhere why because the darkness is
[55:07] breaking through and you
[55:08] do not have power within ourselves to
[55:11] withstand hail that's breaking out don't
[55:14] you understand the tribulation is so
[55:16] close to coming the path the corridors
[55:19] of hell empty now in the realms of
[55:22] mortality and darkness and death and
[55:25] purification is spilling out from the
[55:28] very gates of hell that is not
[55:37] established by man she is not
[55:39] established by the ideology of some
[55:42] seminary who somewhere but she is the
[55:45] Church of the Living God still by Jesus
[55:48] Christ himself
[55:56] let me tell you right now if I built
[55:59] this church this church will fall if
[56:06] brother templar builds his churches no
[56:08] thought but if jesus built this show and
[56:15] loud menu to be part of it during and up
[56:18] gates in hell i sat down enough gates in
[56:21] hell to stop it by his own decree he
[56:30] elected the members of this new creation
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:36] he predestinated them to the adoption of
[56:41] truth according to the good pleasure of
[56:44] their will whose will never members
[56:49] quoting scripture his will by his
[56:52] omniscience and omnipotence he brought
[56:54] it to pass how else could he know that
[56:56] he would be standing in the midst of the
[56:58] church receiving glory from his brethren
[57:03] if he did not make sure well I hope
[57:11] somebody feel sorry for me I'm going to
[57:13] go to theirs and I'm gonna die and I'm
[57:15] gonna go to the cross and I'm gonna
[57:16] bleed and I'm gonna suffer and I'm gonna
[57:18] have the preachers to preach a Sunday
[57:20] after Sunday after Sunday after Sunday
[57:22] and maybe they can plead and make people
[57:25] feel sorry for me nonsense he come to
[57:28] the earth to seek and save that which
[57:30] was lost
[57:33] he ain't got one extra fee often II he's
[57:37] not gonna had to create a theophany
[57:39] because somebody will show up that he
[57:41] didn't know would be there
[57:42] you ain't gonna wind up there and say
[57:44] Lord where's my C - oh then I didn't
[57:46] know yours coming hey I'm sorry about
[57:48] that
[57:49] oh they shift they often I didn't
[57:51] realize just come hey before he had you
[57:53] you was already invited that was sad
[57:56] before you became a turtle on the earth
[58:02] Lauren what's this hey man all things he
[58:07] knew all things he worked out according
[58:11] to what he knew and ordered that his
[58:15] purpose and good pleasure would be
[58:17] brought to pass if he's in so Levantine
[58:21] whom also we have obtained an
[58:22] inheritance being predestinated
[58:24] according to the purpose of him who
[58:26] worketh all things after the counsel of
[58:29] his own will
[58:30] hallelujah aren't you glad that you
[58:33] belong to him praise God aren't you glad
[58:40] you belong there now what's this back to
[58:48] what jesus said in matthew 16 also I say
[58:52] unto thee thou art Peter and upon this
[58:53] rock I will build my church and the
[58:55] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[59:00] the gates and the Bible represent
[59:03] Authority and power the city gate to a
[59:10] Jew was what the courthouse would be to
[59:14] us today now on to renew manacles tag on
[59:19] her car yesterday so where'd I go
[59:22] courthouse went to pay taxes our house
[59:26] where'd I go courthouse I want to make
[59:29] some sort of legal transaction but they
[59:33] didn't have a courthouse so they met in
[59:36] the gates
[59:38] so the gates are a place of business a
[59:44] place of transaction where deeds are
[59:49] traded out I want to buy this property I
[59:53] want to marry this woman
[59:55] and notice what Jesus said now not the
[59:58] windows of hell not the doors of hell
[1:00:02] not the laws of Hell but the gates
[1:00:06] [Applause]
[1:00:09] he knew won't even say important
[1:00:12] business was transacted at the gate
[1:00:17] notice Deuteronomy chapter 21 verse 19
[1:00:19] then shall the father and his mother and
[1:00:22] that this is dealing with a rebellious
[1:00:23] son lay hold on him and bring him out to
[1:00:26] the elders of the city unto the place of
[1:00:28] his the gate of his place and they shall
[1:00:32] say unto the elders of this city this
[1:00:34] our son is stubborn and rebellious he
[1:00:37] will not obey our voice he's a glutton
[1:00:39] and a drunkard well it's a good thing we
[1:00:42] don't do this today o world we bury them
[1:00:46] all it's a good thing we don't do it in
[1:00:49] the church because I'm not sure where we
[1:00:50] buried all the dead church folks either
[1:00:54] now notice so if you had a stubborn son
[1:00:57] and he would not obey you then you would
[1:01:00] bring that son before work not a judge
[1:01:02] not a tribunal they had to send Hedren
[1:01:05] which was the judge in court but they
[1:01:07] would bring him to where was the
[1:01:09] Sanhedrin at the gate so the gate is the
[1:01:13] place of authority the gate is a place
[1:01:16] of judgment the gate is the place where
[1:01:20] transactions are verified and Jesus said
[1:01:24] just so he'll will know my church will
[1:01:27] be built so strong that the gates of
[1:01:31] hell and all of her business and all of
[1:01:34] Hale's transaction
[1:01:36] and all those property and all of Hale's
[1:01:39] business deals will not be able to
[1:01:43] defeat my church dinner on the 22:13 if
[1:01:51] any man take a wife and go into her and
[1:01:53] hate her and give occasions a speech
[1:01:55] against her I'm bringing up an evil name
[1:01:57] upon her and say I took this la woman I
[1:01:59] came to her I found her not a maid then
[1:02:02] shall the father the damsel another
[1:02:04] taken bring forth the tokens of the dams
[1:02:06] of virginity unto the elders of the city
[1:02:10] and the gate so you're accusing or
[1:02:16] beyond pure you are accusing her with
[1:02:19] laying with someone else worse or his
[1:02:23] instance proven that's a gate
[1:02:28] you see Jesus hadn't even gone down and
[1:02:31] took them gates yet but he knew his
[1:02:34] fixing this growing a God better daily
[1:02:39] hasn't even time and raised from the
[1:02:41] dead that he said let me just professor
[1:02:44] I'm fixin to take these gates I won't be
[1:02:50] like Samson well just take him up on my
[1:02:52] back and take him up on the hill on the
[1:02:55] rock of his hump but I will destroy
[1:02:58] their power against my church
[1:03:05] all the Blessed should be the Lord
[1:03:09] second Samuel chapter 19 verse 8 then
[1:03:13] the King rose and said in the gate and
[1:03:16] they told unto all the people saying
[1:03:19] behold the King does sit in the cage and
[1:03:22] all the people came before the king for
[1:03:25] Israel had fed every man to his tent so
[1:03:30] the gate was a sign of significant power
[1:03:34] and authority so the king went well not
[1:03:38] to the courthouse not to the recorder of
[1:03:40] deeds and records but he went to the
[1:03:43] gate so did our king go to the gates
[1:03:50] [Music]
[1:03:52] Ruth chapter 4 verse 1 then when those
[1:04:00] up to the gate praise be to God then
[1:04:07] when Boehm's
[1:04:08] up to the gate and set him down there
[1:04:11] and behold the kinsman of whom ballasts
[1:04:14] fake came by unto whom he said ho ho
[1:04:19] such a one turn aside sit down here and
[1:04:25] he turned aside and sat down
[1:04:28] verse 11 and all the people that were in
[1:04:33] the gate and the elders said we are
[1:04:37] witnesses now this is after he's bought
[1:04:40] ruth-marie the Lord make the woman that
[1:04:47] is common to thy house like a man Rachel
[1:04:51] and like Leah which ii did build the
[1:04:54] house of israel and do thou worthily in
[1:04:57] Ephrata and be a famous in bethlehem
[1:05:01] where was it comes
[1:05:03] maybe where was it saddled in the gate
[1:05:07] now jesus said on this rock I will build
[1:05:11] my church and the gates of hail this
[1:05:17] word here hail is actually Hades not
[1:05:23] Gehenna and those three words in the New
[1:05:27] Testament used Sheol Hades and Gehenna
[1:05:33] but here Jesus says Hades not she'll not
[1:05:41] Gehenna which is fired but simply the
[1:05:46] realm of the Dead the gates of Hades not
[1:05:57] of torment but it will be Hades that
[1:06:02] will come against my church why the
[1:06:08] gates of torments wasted their time for
[1:06:10] trial yet don't you understand if you're
[1:06:15] sealed in the presence of God by the
[1:06:17] Holy Ghost there ain't no need for the
[1:06:19] gates of fire to try to get you so what
[1:06:22] they'll try to get you these gates of
[1:06:25] Hades both natural and spiritual death
[1:06:32] the unseen counterpart of the visible
[1:06:36] grave not what is she'll she'll is the
[1:06:41] grave Hades is the unseen counterpart
[1:06:45] the invisible which answers back to the
[1:06:48] visible so when we take a person's body
[1:06:50] and we bury that body in the ground we
[1:06:53] place them in Sheol Jesus didn't say the
[1:06:58] gates of seal will come against my
[1:07:00] people but the gates of Hades the realm
[1:07:05] of the Dead
[1:07:09] don't you understand when Satan tries to
[1:07:11] get us to commit adultery against the
[1:07:13] Word of God it's the gates of Hill don't
[1:07:15] you understand when preachers or lay or
[1:07:17] to you whoever it is tries to corrupt
[1:07:19] the Word of God and hybridize the Word
[1:07:21] of God and get us to mix something else
[1:07:23] up with the word that'll cause a
[1:07:24] hybridize death don't you know what it
[1:07:26] is
[1:07:26] it's the gates of Hades hell is vomiting
[1:07:30] out remember when the Prophet said there
[1:07:32] he said that I was in JCPenney's sore
[1:07:34] back inhale again do you understand the
[1:07:41] invisible realm of Hades is all around
[1:07:44] us friends trying to kill you trying to
[1:07:49] kill me mama
[1:07:53] notice that so it is the all destructive
[1:07:56] Oh devouring part that every Mortal goes
[1:08:01] to Satan feels confident no one can defy
[1:08:08] death because every mortal must die so
[1:08:15] Jesus says no not really
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:23] now remember Hades
[1:08:25] leads to the prison of the souls of
[1:08:29] course that was imprisoned once they
[1:08:32] leave this realm of mortality so it also
[1:08:35] let's look at in this small form that it
[1:08:37] symbolizes the orchestrated organized
[1:08:40] satanic power by which the business of
[1:08:44] the outlets of Satan is able to be
[1:08:47] administered through the gates so if
[1:08:49] your sanding or the gaiter jerusem and
[1:08:51] as MO as was he wanted to be able to
[1:08:53] take Bruce to meet us why he wanted to
[1:08:55] purchase now on his property so he sets
[1:08:58] and he waits waits and he waits and when
[1:09:01] he sees the near kinsman the devil
[1:09:03] walked through
[1:09:05] just happens so on your snick skin - now
[1:09:11] no wonder some of us is something look
[1:09:12] at our family Trevor's came to the devil
[1:09:14] I could explain why somebody else Ilsa
[1:09:18] mean oh sorry sorry sorry but you see
[1:09:22] whenever he said I said how because we'd
[1:09:25] say hey but they said home so he said
[1:09:28] home
[1:09:29] oh you ah here they say the next of
[1:09:33] Kin's men and you know about now missus
[1:09:35] I've heard about it and she has this so
[1:09:36] dire and oh yes I've heard about tell
[1:09:38] you said well you're the closest of kin
[1:09:41] if you want to take a redeem it for
[1:09:43] yourself and said who is she says a
[1:09:45] Gentile yes sir oh no ed Mar my
[1:09:47] inheritance

[1:09:50] believe shopping and jumping around and
[1:09:51] carrying on and tell you them the ones
[1:09:53] that go to church of my goodness is not
[1:09:55] like a football game or baseball game
[1:09:57] they rally and Chum shouting holler
[1:10:02] praise the Lord
[1:10:03] I ain't they the ones that get all you
[1:10:06] know all religious and all that sort of
[1:10:08] thing they crab and they read the word
[1:10:09] they get all happy that'll go to just
[1:10:12] set down and go to sleep in church and
[1:10:13] say oh my such a people that definitely
[1:10:15] my my inheritance well he said if you
[1:10:18] don't water I'll take her now she's a
[1:10:24] Gentile she's a gold she worshipped ki
[1:10:27] mosh she got all this and that and the
[1:10:31] other
[1:10:31] I agree the outside he was totally
[1:10:33] guilty
[1:10:37] but you don't see what I see when I'm
[1:10:41] looking inside that soul well you don't
[1:10:44] see me what I see it's filled with the
[1:10:47] Holy Ghost
[1:10:49] well you don't see what I see it's a
[1:10:52] name on my board that's why I am the son
[1:10:56] of man and that's why I look Oh Satan
[1:11:01] you see their party its weak and weary
[1:11:04] and low you look upon the flesh and you
[1:11:07] ought to know but you don't see what I
[1:11:10] see when I look at my bag I see the
[1:11:15] bride and Morningstar reflected
[1:11:19] [Applause]
[1:11:26] Wow where'd that come from
[1:11:29] [Applause]
[1:11:39] so Jesus says just to let you know guys
[1:11:44] before I even build my church
[1:11:48] Mitchell let you in a little insight I'm
[1:11:52] fixing the storm the gates it won't be
[1:12:02] me and Gabriel it won't be me and
[1:12:04] wormwood won't be man Donny man down man
[1:12:06] Terry for he alone tread the winepress
[1:12:10] of the wrath of God I'm fixing a store
[1:12:13] in Hades I'm fixing a going to shield
[1:12:16] I'm fixing they're going together I'm
[1:12:18] fixing than going to all of Satan's
[1:12:20] trying to say I'm gonna defeat him in
[1:12:22] all three realms and I'm gonna conquer
[1:12:24] the gates and I'm gonna snatch the keys
[1:12:25] off his side I'm gonna walk up I'm gonna
[1:12:28] kick the door so hard everything on the
[1:12:30] wall it's gonna shut down and I'm fixing
[1:12:33] to go over and open up the six
[1:12:34] dimensional worry for him the fifth and
[1:12:36] I'm gonna let him come out
[1:12:38] Abraham on Isaac and Jacob and Joseph
[1:12:40] and Daniel and cheering mind
[1:12:42] self-aligned Zechariah obsession to
[1:12:45] leave my people out of the gates of hell
[1:12:48] [Applause]
[1:12:59] so here comes the stormtroopers and he
[1:13:08] delivered the catfish out of her gates
[1:13:14] [Applause]
[1:13:16] let me tell you something friend he is
[1:13:18] so powerful he didn't need an army if
[1:13:21] you honestly think he needs you to
[1:13:23] overcome you need to scratch your head
[1:13:24] and realize who you are he don't need
[1:13:28] you in the Millenium to come in and
[1:13:29] conquer he could do this whole thing by
[1:13:31] himself he's letting you go along for
[1:13:33] the ride he don't need me to conquer he
[1:13:38] don't need you to conquer he's letting
[1:13:41] us go along with him and Barry's glory
[1:13:43] [Applause]
[1:13:50] you imagine Satan in this month thinking
[1:13:53] fun but start a church start one but
[1:13:58] every one of them leaders will die I'll
[1:14:03] wind up getting them all
[1:14:06] so you made Peter special John special a
[1:14:09] new special fine they'll live their life
[1:14:12] they'll get old and they'll die
[1:14:16] inevitably she'll I'll get them and then
[1:14:24] what will happen to your church but you
[1:14:27] see he put a clause in this every age is
[1:14:30] firstborn generation
[1:14:32] [Applause]
[1:14:37] hopeless don't bother you tonight I
[1:14:39] believe I've got the same Holy Ghost
[1:14:40] reader head i baptize so what he did I
[1:14:44] preached what he did
[1:14:45] hope it's don't offend I actually
[1:14:47] appreciate a more understanding of what
[1:14:49] he had 2,000 years ago and so do you
[1:14:52] brothers here because of God's grace I
[1:14:54] say that but listen I could have stood
[1:14:56] up I could have been that in the upper
[1:14:58] room brother doubt it could have been me
[1:15:00] and you and you said sure tonight I'm
[1:15:02] gonna shut up that day and say men and
[1:15:04] brother you've got to repent and be
[1:15:06] baptized why I'm part of that same body
[1:15:10] I've got the same Holy Ghost
[1:15:12] I'm the same identified Christian as
[1:15:15] they were I'm not third generation
[1:15:17] fourth generation 500th generation
[1:15:19] I am the firstborn I belong to the
[1:15:23] tracks on the firstborn
[1:15:25] - did not destroy it
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:36] look at all Robertson his ministry and
[1:15:39] what he done no doubt a man helped a lot
[1:15:40] of people look at his son what happened
[1:15:46] now but his son gets old and dies who
[1:15:47] take it from better look up in the graph
[1:15:50] look at his side look a better plan look
[1:15:55] at his sons can they do what he did or
[1:15:59] not call to praise the Lord
[1:16:03] now we don't say that to run them down
[1:16:05] none of them that I just mentioned but
[1:16:07] it does not come by blood it comes by
[1:16:10] the blood of God not Branham blood
[1:16:13] greenberg Roberts blood Reagan blood it
[1:16:17] comes by the blood of God you've got to
[1:16:19] be born again well praise the Lord
[1:16:27] [Applause]
[1:16:29] imagine Satan saying all human travelers
[1:16:38] eventually and at this time remember
[1:16:45] paradise had not been cleared up yet
[1:16:50] they imagine him saying and words
[1:16:53] Abraham would you mind telling me where
[1:16:56] Jacob is tonight Maddie preacher and was
[1:17:00] just what about Hagar
[1:17:02] what about Malachi what about all the
[1:17:05] seed of Abraham where are they in my
[1:17:09] gates
[1:17:15] but Jesus could just kind of smile
[1:17:18] though that lot brother Darrell just
[1:17:19] smiled at me right there he can smile at
[1:17:21] the devil not say a word just kind of
[1:17:23] smile because he knew what the future
[1:17:25] held so he could go ahead and say it oh
[1:17:30] yes
[1:17:31] you all will live and you will die as
[1:17:33] mortals and your family will carry over
[1:17:36] the grave and then another generational
[1:17:38] pass and another generational pass but
[1:17:40] this is not the same thing as a natural
[1:17:42] kingdom this is a mystical kingdom
[1:17:45] called the church and I will have people
[1:17:48] in every day God has had somebody in
[1:17:50] every age that would stand for the truth
[1:17:53] this age will go old friends he will not
[1:17:56] let this age pass but not only having
[1:17:59] one or two he's gonna have thousands
[1:18:01] times thousands the disciples standing
[1:18:10] right there were dying men and dying
[1:18:14] mortal bodies so Satan could say no
[1:18:19] problem I'll wait my turn look at us
[1:18:26] look at what I look like thirty years
[1:18:28] ago when I come here look what you often
[1:18:31] turn to me
[1:18:36] we could turn around the other way look
[1:18:38] what I've done to you so Satan could
[1:18:48] make his bride go ahead do whatever you
[1:18:53] want to do eventually Center or suit
[1:19:00] prophet or sage they all go through my
[1:19:05] gates after gays now Jesus can't say too
[1:19:15] much right here in Matthew 16 cuz he
[1:19:17] died yet and they don't want to let the
[1:19:20] whole seventh seal I mean the whole
[1:19:22] program of God you know be outright
[1:19:24] plain where the devil can read it like a
[1:19:26] newspaper but he can go ahead and
[1:19:28] prophesy and say on this rock I'll build
[1:19:30] my church and the gates of Hades shall
[1:19:32] not prevail against it let me just say
[1:19:37] it
[1:19:37] Satan has emptied his quiver Satan has
[1:19:43] shot
[1:19:44] Hobie shells he said he'd ever cannon
[1:19:47] he's got and the church is still
[1:19:50] marching
[1:19:54] [Applause]
[1:19:56] he tried to burn him he tried to stand
[1:19:59] the deck he tried to drown them he tried
[1:20:02] to shut him up he thrown up in jail he
[1:20:04] does everything he knew to do and in
[1:20:07] spite of everything he does they get
[1:20:09] stronger and stronger and stronger why
[1:20:14] Jesus said so the church's security is
[1:20:26] not just going to be based upon the
[1:20:28] longevity of these men the perpetuity of
[1:20:31] Peters preaching the perpetuity of James
[1:20:34] the longevity of Paul then heaven of if
[1:20:38] they will die but the church hold if the
[1:20:44] Lord tarries had a few years under my
[1:20:46] age eventually I'll pass and you'll have
[1:20:50] to get somebody else to be your pastor
[1:20:55] but will the real church darling I'd die
[1:20:58] if you do you are nothing but a South's
[1:21:00] down the wolf Reaganite brother down
[1:21:05] there here I can't make it off shame you
[1:21:07] ought to be ashamed of yourself you only
[1:21:09] don't want to be no Regan I do want to
[1:21:11] be a Christian hey brother there goes
[1:21:17] good fun people burn better Brandon went
[1:21:18] on to say they will go no no it'll be
[1:21:20] the end of the message guess again
[1:21:25] this message has been taken the corners
[1:21:28] of the earth that brother branham was
[1:21:30] never even allowed to go why the
[1:21:33] longevity of the message is not based
[1:21:35] upon the human messenger it's not based
[1:21:38] upon just the human preachers Jesus
[1:21:42] built this church so the gates are the
[1:21:54] place of strength place traditionary
[1:21:58] judgment the place of arms final word so
[1:22:06] you take the gates you control the city
[1:22:12] now you actually don't have to brake for
[1:22:14] that through eight-foot walls and you
[1:22:16] know knock down every wall you get two
[1:22:18] gates you've got the whole thing
[1:22:21] [Applause]
[1:22:23] hallelujah if you can pass through them
[1:22:26] gates all glory to God can you imagine
[1:22:28] old friend I imagine Satan must have got
[1:22:31] so mad at himself and so mad at his
[1:22:34] demons once he realized what has
[1:22:38] happened on Calvary oh I'd love to been
[1:22:41] down in hell just a few minutes after
[1:22:43] Jesus to die ghosts of the door and
[1:22:49] opens the door ha there you are
[1:22:52] I thought I'd got you when I got Abel in
[1:22:54] that amazing he thought he got him when
[1:22:56] they got Abel I thought I got you and I
[1:22:58] got Moses I thought I got you he was
[1:23:00] looking for God to become a man that's
[1:23:03] the third dad and you're the third man
[1:23:04] rather of Genesis 3 that man that God
[1:23:07] prophesied will bruise the Serpent's
[1:23:08] head it was the one that he kept looking
[1:23:11] for I said yes but now I'm here my blood
[1:23:15] is still hot on Calvary give me the keys
[1:23:19] give me the case praise God the blood of
[1:23:31] a bull and the goat was not strong
[1:23:32] enough to open up and clear the
[1:23:34] dimensions her Abraham would be able to
[1:23:37] release it going under the altar of God
[1:23:39] so when he died and he slept with his
[1:23:41] fathers and they burned his body his
[1:23:44] soul went down into paradise Jacob died
[1:23:49] that buried his body soul was covered
[1:23:52] with his father where paradise not in
[1:23:55] heavenly bliss not in bluegrass not in
[1:23:58] the sixth dimension in paradise
[1:24:04] once you're glad you're married to the
[1:24:07] Paradise Cynthia if he can enter
[1:24:14] paradise he can empty you all the hell
[1:24:16] that bothers you if he can empty out
[1:24:19] paradise he can into you of all your

[1:40:41] praise be to God glory Bittaker why
[1:40:48] because jesus said so don't you love him
[1:40:58] praise God he looked down through these
[1:41:02] ages they saw the darkness he saw them
[1:41:05] deaths on the cross the crucifixes he
[1:41:09] saw up near over do he saw that Nero
[1:41:13] would have some of our brothers and
[1:41:14] sisters wrapped up in muslin type cloths
[1:41:17] and he would have pitch poured on their
[1:41:22] bodies and he wanted to walk in his
[1:41:25] garden his palace garden at night so he
[1:41:29] would have them Christians lined up say
[1:41:32] this was the garden path right here he
[1:41:35] would have to Christians to Christians
[1:41:37] to Christians to Christians but the
[1:41:39] lawyer what he wanted to take a walk a
[1:41:40] stroll in the night in the garden past
[1:41:42] they would wrap up in Christians in this
[1:41:45] material poor pitch on the material and
[1:41:48] that set him on fire as human torches to
[1:41:56] me it is a reflection of what the gates
[1:41:59] of Hell saw in these believers they
[1:42:03] couldn't get their souls and fire close
[1:42:06] as they could get lose their bodies that
[1:42:10] already been lit by the pillar of fire
[1:42:13] and Satan is mimicking or making fun of
[1:42:17] them and ending their life all we take
[1:42:20] God's our healer God said old friend we
[1:42:22] don't know how we'll leave this world
[1:42:23] some of us may leave racked with pain
[1:42:25] with cancer or some car wreck this or
[1:42:28] that another don't you understand why
[1:42:29] whenever he's allowed to do that is
[1:42:31] allowed to do that to you it's to mark
[1:42:35] and mimic your testimony which proves it
[1:42:39] could never get you
[1:42:41] he hated you to the very end he's god
[1:42:49] that's a kind of believer I want to be
[1:42:51] don't you it's power hence again if you
[1:42:55] had praise of God Oh Heavenly Father we
[1:43:02] are so glad to be a part of this church
[1:43:06] tonight when I say that I don't mean
[1:43:09] just so much happy Valley but Lord a
[1:43:14] part of this mystical church this church
[1:43:19] that you built difference of these
[1:43:23] people here Lord told me of the
[1:43:27] beginning of this church happy valid
[1:43:30] started at Rome Hill or something like
[1:43:32] that I think they've told me and some of
[1:43:35] their fathers and grandfathers that
[1:43:37] started years ago as at Pentecostal
[1:43:39] church and then they tore down a
[1:43:41] building and about some of that material
[1:43:43] here and built it here then it was
[1:43:49] introduced into the message Lord many of
[1:43:52] them worked on it no doubt that laboring
[1:43:56] to it as far as building it the father
[1:44:00] we know you're the only one that can
[1:44:03] really build that true church Oh
[1:44:07] hallelujah you said upon this rock I
[1:44:10] will build my church and the
[1:44:14] administration the authority the
[1:44:17] dispensation said from the gates will
[1:44:21] not prevail against it
[1:44:24] praise God Satan emptied all of his
[1:44:29] cannons he emptied everything against
[1:44:33] that early church you could never
[1:44:35] destroy it second church age third force
[1:44:38] my thought he had it when it down into
[1:44:40] total darkness for hundreds of years
[1:44:43] under Catholicism but you got a hole to
[1:44:47] the little German priest
[1:44:48] a restlessness that had been on his soul
[1:44:51] for many many years
[1:44:53] he would beat himself he would pray
[1:44:57] agonizing trying to find peace with God
[1:45:01] one day while reading the book of Romans
[1:45:04] you click and it to his heart the just
[1:45:08] shall live by faith it probably caused a
[1:45:13] little rattle on the outer hinge on
[1:45:17] maybe the right-hand side of the gate of
[1:45:19] Hell Satan probably sent one of his
[1:45:23] demons over there with a little
[1:45:24] spiritual wd-40 it's kind of all that
[1:45:27] gate and say I am a little rattled maybe
[1:45:31] over there ain't nothing happened on the
[1:45:33] earth for hundreds of years now little
[1:45:37] did the devil know you were just set a
[1:45:39] man on fire praise God the gates of hell
[1:45:43] would be shook you've done it over and
[1:45:46] over again Lord in this day when a
[1:45:51] little baby was born glory to God
[1:45:54] and an angel signified his birth
[1:45:59] supernatural started following him
[1:46:01] imagine the gates
[1:46:03] was it real alert when he started
[1:46:06] telling people their names their
[1:46:09] addresses even that their dr. Ward
[1:46:14] tortoiseshell glasses
[1:46:16] I imagine the gate started shaken and
[1:46:20] rattled his worse than Elvis Presley oh
[1:46:24] ma I can just think in my mind in 1965
[1:46:32] that prophet passed away they thought
[1:46:36] this is the end the message ends right
[1:46:42] here without him being here it was never
[1:46:46] gone immediately men started vying for
[1:46:51] positions of he ordained me he called my
[1:46:55] name on tape so many times I was this
[1:46:57] Saturday October pretty Jessica I was
[1:47:00] saying that help they'll kill
[1:47:01] theirselves she made it through the 60s
[1:47:06] she made it through the sadness Bluebird
[1:47:10] to God no doubt Lau these people that
[1:47:13] were saying thought the Hades I'll never
[1:47:16] see it they didn't know my name was on
[1:47:18] the book let him know the rapture
[1:47:22] couldn't take place Maya we made it to
[1:47:25] the eighties we made it to the 90s oh we
[1:47:30] never thought 2000 come now we passed it
[1:47:33] and we're still running in fine course
[1:47:36] we made it to the here I stand well he
[1:47:40] made it to the believer sign we made it
[1:47:42] through all the rest of it and the
[1:47:44] church is still said Satan is offered
[1:47:48] this administrative ID and this
[1:47:50] administrative idea and the gates of
[1:47:52] Hell have gathered over this message
[1:47:54] more than any message that's ever been
[1:47:56] on the earth glory to God
[1:47:58] we have calls more conferences than any
[1:48:01] other message on the earth because the

[1:52:31] Jesus we worship you tonight I don't
[1:52:34] know great mighty God we're glad we know
[1:52:39] who you are to my father
[1:52:41] we're not praying to a little boy he
[1:52:43] left to look over to his older father
[1:52:45] and ask him if it's okay if he answers
[1:52:47] this prayer you are the father Philip
[1:52:52] have I been so long time with you and
[1:52:54] you haven't known who I am when you've
[1:52:57] seen me you've seen the Prophet comes
[1:53:02] and captures that and says when you see
[1:53:05] the word manifested you have seen the
[1:53:08] father God praise be to God baby to God
[1:53:15] that he comes as freeport and tells us
[1:53:17] the word interpreted is the
[1:53:20] manifestation of the name of God thank
[1:53:26] you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight
[1:53:29] father oh I know it may seem similar the
[1:53:33] church calls the name of Jesus
[1:53:35] and the church calls the name of Jesus
[1:53:37] and people that don't know any different
[1:53:40] think that what's the difference these
[1:53:42] people call the name of Jesus they live
[1:53:44] this way dress this way do this and in
[1:53:46] the other they drink and do whatever
[1:53:48] more and yet these other people they
[1:53:50] look different they act different they
[1:53:51] believe strange doctrines and yet they
[1:53:53] called the name of Jesus as well but
[1:53:56] we're calling the name from the
[1:53:57] manifestation of the interpretation of
[1:54:00] that name in our lives we're not just
[1:54:04] repeating the name of Jesus is some
[1:54:06] magical connotation this is not a
[1:54:09] magical ritual it is he and us order to
[1:54:14] God it is him than us believing his own
[1:54:16] word against all circumstances that the
[1:54:20] Prophet said we doubt her doubts glory
[1:54:24] to God his faith in us we do not doubt
[1:54:28] his word we doubt our doubts so if we're
[1:54:32] gonna doubt tonight God we're gonna
[1:54:34] doubt our doubts we're gonna doubt our
[1:54:37] fears we're gonna doubt iron fairies but
[1:54:41] we're gonna believe your word
[1:54:42] that's what believers do they believe
[1:54:48] praise be to God Oh bless your Holy Name
[1:54:53] Lord Jesus you love him too that sense
[1:54:57] or can we worship Him just a little
[1:55:00] before they go just a few minutes oh
[1:55:02] praise God aren't you glad you're a
[1:55:06] member of the church that Jesus built
[1:55:10] praise God it's not a Baptist Church
[1:55:14] it's not a Methodist Church it's not
[1:55:16] Church of God please don't misunderstand
[1:55:18] me we can call our church a message
[1:55:20] Church well if that's all we are we're
[1:55:23] no more than a Baptist Church many folks
[1:55:25] go to a message Church if we're not
[1:55:27] careful that's going to become another
[1:55:29] denominational tag amen we don't want to
[1:55:33] just beat message people by name we want
[1:55:36] this message living in us
[1:55:38] manifesting itself everyday out of our
[1:55:42] lives that you are written epistles that
[1:55:45] people can see the signature of God in
[1:55:50] your life
