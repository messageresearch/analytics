[34:12] All the trump
[34:14] shall
[34:16] resound
[34:19] and my Lord
[34:21] shall
[34:23] descend
[34:25] even so
[34:29] it is well
[34:32] with my soul.
[34:39] Yes, it is well
[34:43] [Music]
[34:47] with my soul.
[34:54] It is well.
[34:58] It is well
[35:01] with my soul.
[35:07] Yes. Bless it is well.
[35:15] Oh with my soul.
[35:23] It is well.
[35:27] It is well
[35:30] with my soul.
[35:40] [Music]
[35:42] [Applause]
[35:46] Praise the Lord. How blessed we are
[35:49] tonight.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; If we can say that and it's the truth.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; A lot of people say it, but when it
[35:56] comes right down to it, it ain't so. But
[35:59] if we can say that and it is a reality,
[36:02] we are one blessed human being. Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; If you're so broke you ain't got two
[36:06] nickels to rub together. If you had to
[36:09] hitchhike to church, you're not sure how
[36:11] you going to pay any of bills, but
[36:13] you're saved tonight and you love God
[36:15] with all your heart, you're one of the
[36:16] most blessed human beings that's ever
[36:18] set foot on this earth.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Isn't it wonderful
[36:22] to be together in the house of God?
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a privilege it is for us.
[36:27] Let's turn to Genesis chapter 24 tonight
[36:29] if you would. Verse 58.
[36:31] I want to speak to you again tonight,
[36:33] Lord willing, on the bride's dowy.
[36:37] Genesis 24:58. And they called Rebecca
[36:40] and said unto her, "What thou go with
[36:43] this man?" And she said, "Well, I better
[36:46] check with the overseer and see what the
[36:48] bishop has to say." And let me see if I
[36:51] can do a Google check on this guy. And
[36:53] let me check and see if there's any
[36:55] YouTube videos about him.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[37:00] Let me just ask you. If you've been
[37:02] living the days of John the Baptist,
[37:05] according to what God said in the book
[37:06] of Deuteronomy,
[37:08] the way you know a man know it's a
[37:10] prophet
[37:11] because he will see visions and what he
[37:14] says comes to pass.
[37:16] So if you lived in the days of John the
[37:18] Baptist and you were looking for
[37:19] prophecies that John said to come to
[37:22] pass before you believed he was a
[37:24] prophet,
[37:26] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you'd ever believed him.
[37:29] Huh?
[37:30] &gt;&gt; According to the Bible, prophets have
[37:32] got signs.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; John didn't have any.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; No miracles,
[37:40] &gt;&gt; no wonders,
[37:42] no healings.
[37:46] I'm sorry y'all didn't know that.
[37:50] How would you have known?
[37:52] So if you're going to judge it by the
[37:53] Torah, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, the Lord
[37:57] your God shall raise up a prophet. And
[37:59] then he goes from Christ and goes to the
[38:01] other prophets and tells how it'll be.
[38:03] So if they was going to judge it by
[38:06] that, how would they have ever known?
[38:08] Now you realize many of these folks
[38:10] today, there's been so many signs and
[38:13] wonders and miraculous things that have
[38:16] been done and they still don't believe.
[38:18] They'd sure been in a mess in the days
[38:20] of John the Baptist, wouldn't they?
[38:22] &gt;&gt; But the elect wouldn't
[38:24] &gt;&gt; cuz they believe.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Now, notice what's going to happen. And
[38:29] they sent away Rebecca, their sister,
[38:33] and her nurse, and Abraham's servant,
[38:36] and his men. And they blessed Rebecca,
[38:41] and said unto her, "Thou art our sister.
[38:45] Be thou the mother of thousands of
[38:49] millions,
[38:51] and let thy seed possess the gate of
[38:54] those which hate them. And Rebecca arose
[38:58] and her damsels, and they rode upon the
[39:01] camels, and followed the man. And the
[39:04] servant took Rebecca, and went his way.
[39:08] Now remember when she left she would
[39:11] have taken her dowy from her father. It
[39:16] would be the gift from her family given
[39:20] to the bride by the father for her new
[39:24] life and also in this situation to make
[39:28] her journey as comfortable as possible
[39:33] on the back of a camel for 450 to 500
[39:38] miles.
[39:40] So what do you reckon was in that diary?
[39:43] I reckon everything she needed for the
[39:45] journey. What do you reckon's in yours?
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Everything you need for your journey.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together.
[39:54] Lord Jesus, we so love you tonight.
[39:56] Father, we thank you for your word. We
[39:58] thank you for the opportunity, Lord,
[39:59] that once again been given to us that we
[40:02] could gather together in the house of
[40:04] God and sing and worship and hear prayer
[40:07] requests and hear of things that you've
[40:09] done in the lives of your children.
[40:12] Father, we just say we love you with all
[40:14] of our hearts. Dear God, we're just
[40:16] asking may our hearts, our souls, our
[40:19] lives be attuned to the gospel tonight
[40:23] that we can be blessed by our gathering
[40:25] together. And we know it's just
[40:26] Wednesday night. For some people, they
[40:28] just, well, you know, it's just
[40:30] Wednesday night. I don't know if I'll go
[40:31] or not. There probably won't be a lot
[40:33] happen. Oh, but Lord, that ain't the way
[40:35] we look at it. We look at it. They ain't
[40:38] no telling what's going to happen right
[40:39] here tonight. We're just opening our
[40:41] hearts and we're believing that you've
[40:43] got something special for us. So I pray
[40:46] that you would help us. Help me to get
[40:47] out of the way. Help the people to be
[40:49] able to get out of the way to lay aside
[40:51] their troubles, their problems, their
[40:53] issues. Lord, I believe if we can be
[40:56] able to get what you have before us
[40:58] tonight, we'll walk out of these doors a
[41:01] change people. Granted, I pray, Father,
[41:03] in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. God
[41:06] bless you, saints. Believers are given
[41:09] gifts. you may be seated by their father
[41:12] to equip them for this new life and in
[41:16] this case also for her journey because
[41:19] she's going to make quite a transition
[41:21] going from the land that she's known all
[41:24] of her life into a land into a people
[41:27] that she's never even met before marry a
[41:29] man she's never seen uh in-laws you
[41:32] don't even know anything about hardly
[41:34] other than just what this man has told
[41:36] her she's also changing rank
[41:39] and changing position. So she's coming
[41:42] from a person of low estate into a queen
[41:46] position. She's coming from a person who
[41:49] has been brought up under one set of
[41:52] scenarios and types of situations into a
[41:55] total different one. Moving from a
[41:58] family that is riddled with idolatry
[42:01] into a family which formerly was in
[42:05] idolatry but now is in a one God
[42:07] message. And they have peculiar ways of
[42:10] believing and very strange ideas of the
[42:14] concept and the ideology in that day.
[42:17] Anyway, you understand that Abraham was
[42:19] one of the first men in this period of
[42:21] time that monotheism monotheism
[42:24] believing one God that monotheism was
[42:27] revealed to him. How odd and strange it
[42:31] must have been in that day. And yet this
[42:34] woman is now remember she's not 30. Not
[42:37] 35, 40, 45, 16 years old. 16y old girl
[42:41] and she's fixing to have her life
[42:44] totally transformed by following this
[42:47] man. And she don't get 7 days, 10 days,
[42:50] 14 days. As a matter of fact, she gets
[42:52] just a few hours from the time that she
[42:55] meets this man until she's going to be
[42:57] faced with this decision. But you see,
[42:59] it's not really that hard when an angel
[43:02] of God comes and ministers to you. Now,
[43:06] how is it that Eleazar could have such
[43:09] confidence that God was going to do
[43:11] this? Because his master Abraham told
[43:14] him, "The angel of God will go before
[43:18] you." So, he could go with all
[43:20] assurance. I imagine that the man had
[43:23] great revelation and faith and believing
[43:26] that the angel of God would go. there.
[43:28] Is it a strange thing then to us that
[43:32] God in this day would send an angel to
[43:35] our prophet whenever he himself was
[43:38] going to face one of the greatest
[43:40] challenges that any man had ever faced.
[43:43] The Pentecostal message had died down.
[43:46] The Pentecostal revival had died down
[43:48] and withered. People had lost interest.
[43:51] And God is going to send a man not to
[43:54] restore back to 1906, but to 33 AD. And
[43:58] what did God do? He didn't give him a
[44:01] Harvard education. He didn't send it to
[44:03] Bob Jones. But God sent him an angel
[44:07] with a message. And the angel would
[44:09] appear to him in such a shocking way.
[44:12] Now, God has angelic visitations all
[44:14] down through time. And some of them were
[44:16] visible. And some of them were more
[44:18] prominent and visible than others. So
[44:20] you can imagine you're there and you're
[44:22] praying and before you you hear
[44:24] footsteps and you look from where you're
[44:27] down on your face and you see the foot
[44:29] the feet of of this angel of God. You
[44:33] hear this voice because you're there
[44:35] because your brothers, your elders have
[44:37] told you that these visions and dreams
[44:40] are of the devil. And this being is
[44:42] stand before you and tell you I have
[44:45] been sent from the presence of almighty
[44:47] God to tell you about your peculiar
[44:50] birth and so on and so on. Sir, that's
[44:53] why I'm here. That's why I'm here. And
[44:55] this man stands before him and speaks to
[44:58] him. Why? Not just for him, but for you.
[45:02] So you'd be able to have confidence and
[45:05] know that this man was not sin. So that
[45:08] people would say, "Oh, what a great man
[45:10] he was." And boy, he had a great
[45:12] ministry. And boy, he was really, really
[45:14] anointed of God. But so that you and I
[45:16] would be able to look back and realize
[45:19] when has there ever been another that
[45:22] was quite appeared to in this same
[45:25] scenario. And the church said, "So I
[45:27] really don't care how many YouTube
[45:29] videos they put out, the denters that
[45:32] have left the message and all of those
[45:34] that are trying to disprove that our
[45:36] land isn't real. I say the same thing to
[45:39] them that was said in Numbers chapter
[45:42] 13. We are well able to take our
[45:45] inheritance. Let us go up right now and
[45:48] take what is ours. Now, it's not for
[45:51] everybody. And apparently, it's not for
[45:53] those that even sat around the message
[45:55] for years and years and really wasted a
[45:57] lot of years of their life. It may not
[45:59] be for them, but it's for me. I believe
[46:02] there's other people here tonight that
[46:04] is for you. Eleazar was not sent into
[46:08] that land for everybody. And the prophet
[46:10] of God describes it very well in
[46:12] decision time in 1959. Preaches it of
[46:15] course in Chicago, Los Angeles. Preaches
[46:18] it again in 55 also in 56. And he talks
[46:21] about that it had come at such a time as
[46:24] this that the angel of God made himself
[46:27] real to Rebecca. So she did have an
[46:31] advantage with an angelic visitation
[46:34] that would drop something in her soul
[46:37] that everybody else in that land simply
[46:39] did not have. I trust it's happened to
[46:42] us the same way.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Now looking at what type of a dowy that
[46:48] our father gave to us. Now remember,
[46:51] it's for our journey in present tense,
[46:54] but it also ties us from time into
[46:58] eternity. Now remember, part of it was
[47:00] revealed in shadows and types of the New
[47:03] Testament. But the mystery, the hard
[47:07] secret of it all was actually kept until
[47:11] the New Testament. Read with me if you
[47:12] would in Ephesians chapter 3:9. And Paul
[47:16] said to make all men see what is the
[47:20] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[47:24] beginning of the world hath been hid in
[47:28] God who created all things by Jesus
[47:32] Christ. I want you to notice he's the
[47:34] only man in the New Testament that used
[47:38] such divine vernacular. Not another man
[47:42] taught this way. Now, he was a smart
[47:44] man. I grant you that. But so was Luke.
[47:47] Luke knew several different languages.
[47:49] Luke studied under the Greeks. Luke
[47:51] studied under the Stoics. Luke studied
[47:54] under several different ones. But yet,
[47:56] he never talked the way Paul did. Paul
[47:58] was not just smart, but he had a divine
[48:01] inspiration from God. And Paul is sure
[48:05] going to share with the dispensation
[48:08] that was given to him. Now remember,
[48:10] every man that is called of God to
[48:12] preach is given a portion of the
[48:15] dispensation of the gospel. Now you
[48:18] remember when CO was around and we set
[48:20] up the little machines everywhere and we
[48:23] had a little hand dispensers and
[48:25] everybody would stand there depending on
[48:27] how scared you of of CO. Some people
[48:30] would stand there and get a squirt and
[48:32] another squirt, another squirt. Some
[48:34] people nearly took a bath in it, I
[48:35] reckon. Why? because they wanted to
[48:37] dispense enough to cover all their
[48:39] germs. Well, some preachers, God gives
[48:42] them just a little bit of dispensation
[48:45] of the gospel. They can preach
[48:47] salvation. They can preach the cross.
[48:49] They can preach, you know, a justified
[48:51] life. Others, God dispenses a couple of
[48:54] dispensations to them. They're able to
[48:57] lead people to the true baptism of the
[48:59] Holy Ghost, which is a real great thing
[49:01] for a servant of God to do. Others are
[49:04] able to break into the mystery of God
[49:06] about different aspects. But a prophet
[49:09] messenger to the church age. It's like
[49:12] he stands there and for years God
[49:14] dispenses, dispenses, dispenses,
[49:18] dispenses. He breaks into the avenue of
[49:20] God that even other God called men sat
[49:24] there and they think, "My goodness, what
[49:26] a gift from God." And this is the way it
[49:29] was with Paul. Now notice he said he
[49:32] make all men see what is the fellowship
[49:36] of the mysteries. So there is a
[49:39] fellowship which is coia coia pulled
[49:43] together with an understanding a coia of
[49:48] the mystery. Now notice so it moves
[49:50] beyond the cross. It moves beyond water
[49:53] baptism. It moves beyond just being
[49:56] saved and into a fellowship of the
[49:59] mystery which from the beginning of the
[50:02] world. Notice has been hid in God. Now
[50:07] think how great this is. In the heart of
[50:10] God in his great divine counsel was the
[50:15] covenant which was even hid from the
[50:18] angels. God never let the angels know
[50:23] what was in his mind. It was kept a
[50:27] secret. The types of the Old Testament
[50:31] could only foreshadow it a little bit.
[50:33] Now remember, I'm talking about your
[50:35] diary. So in his heart was hid this
[50:40] secret and his heart was the source of
[50:43] the gospel. His heart was the source of
[50:48] this great divine mystery. So it
[50:50] expresses the the richness and the great
[50:53] value of what God had hid and himself.
[50:57] Now notice it also displays safety as
[51:01] well as secrecy. So it was hid in the
[51:06] very heart of God. Now God could write
[51:09] certain things in the stars and he did
[51:11] and he wrote many many patterns and
[51:14] styles in the stars and he declared his
[51:16] mercy and his forgiveness in the heavens
[51:18] and he put it in the zodiac. But even in
[51:20] the zodiac it was not written clear.
[51:23] Why? Because it was still in the most
[51:26] safe place that this mystery could be
[51:29] held which was in the heart of God.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Now this signified safety. Excuse me.
[51:36] excuse me, safety as well as secrecy. So
[51:40] it was hid from Jeremiah, Ezekiel,
[51:44] Zephaniah, Malachi, Zachchariah. It was
[51:46] hid even from the four writers of the
[51:50] four gospels in the New Testament. But
[51:52] it was revealed to one that was born out
[51:56] of season, one that probably some of us
[51:58] would have never even chosen because of
[52:00] the type of man that he was. Now watch
[52:03] Paul as he says that to make all men see
[52:06] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[52:09] which from the beginning of the world.
[52:11] So from the beginning of the world. So
[52:15] notice when this sequence moved into the
[52:18] very heart of God from the beginning of
[52:21] the world. But remember the prophet
[52:23] tells us that way back before the
[52:25] foundation of the world it was in the
[52:28] back part of God's mind. So watch the
[52:31] revelation as it moves in the faculty of
[52:35] God as it will move from one spot to
[52:39] another. Thoughts can be in your mind
[52:43] and can be there and remain there
[52:45] forever without a manifestation.
[52:48] But when God wanted to bring this from
[52:51] his mind, where did he move it to? Not
[52:54] to his mouth, not to his hands.
[52:57] Remember, he's spirit, not to his feet.
[53:00] He's spirit. So where did it go to? The
[53:03] very heart of God. And what was Jesus?
[53:07] The very heart of God. So in the heart
[53:10] of God was the council, the covenant,
[53:14] the safe place, the mysterious part of
[53:18] redemption, which shows that the
[53:20] original and source of the gospel being
[53:23] expressed come from the very heart of
[53:25] God. Now notice in verse 10 that he says
[53:28] to the intent that now unto the
[53:32] principalities and powers and heavenly
[53:35] places might be known by the church
[53:41] to the intent that now unto the
[53:44] principalities which is the first in
[53:47] order of succession. principalities and
[53:51] powers in heavenly places might be made
[53:54] known. Not by cherubams, not by
[53:57] seraphims, not by zoos. But God would
[54:00] declare the secret which was in his
[54:03] heart. Not by divine beings which did
[54:06] not have a creation in time. Not by
[54:09] divine beings which never fail. But he
[54:12] would manifold of man his manifold grace
[54:16] and mystery variegated ways of wisdom
[54:19] through what? something that would seem
[54:23] so weak and so frail and it didn't even
[54:27] manifest it through the stars. Oh my.
[54:30] You know, as if they've sent it up the
[54:32] James Web telescope and they're finding
[54:34] out more and more and more about all
[54:37] that's out there and they say they're
[54:39] going to have to totally rewrite some of
[54:41] the books on science and they're going
[54:44] to have to totally change some of their
[54:46] theories because of stuff that they are
[54:48] finding. And they keep going out and out
[54:51] and farther out. And the farther they
[54:53] go, the more they see. And yet they're
[54:56] not even reading the very heart of God
[54:59] yet because the heart of God was not
[55:02] displayed there. That's great. I'm not
[55:04] saying that it isn't great. Now, but
[55:06] notice he uses the word to the intent.
[55:09] So the sense is for design and purpose.
[55:13] For the design and purpose that now unto
[55:17] the principalities. So the grand purpose
[55:20] in the creation of the universe was that
[55:23] the wisdom of God might be displayed why
[55:27] and his greatness and show even in the
[55:29] planets. So as we look out on this in
[55:32] the clear night and we see the what is
[55:34] called the luminosity of different stars
[55:36] and according to the metallergical core
[55:39] that's on the inside how much copper how
[55:42] much iron how much this and that each
[55:44] one of them are rated by a certain
[55:46] luminosity and the the greater the
[55:48] luminosity the smaller the number. So
[55:51] they look out there and they're able to
[55:52] judge it and sound these beams off of it
[55:55] and it comes back and they're able to
[55:57] tell how big that it is. So you look and
[55:59] you see they're not all the same. They
[56:01] vary in size. They vary in color. And
[56:04] then they go to this gaseous section
[56:06] inside the universe where stars are are
[56:09] coming to burst. And even now stars are
[56:12] still coming to the birth and the
[56:14] universe is still ongoing and expanding
[56:17] and God is still displaying himself. Yet
[56:20] that was not hid in the heart of God. He
[56:22] made it right there where people could
[56:24] look at it for years. Galileo looked at
[56:26] it back in the 1600s. Many men have
[56:28] looked at it in their primitive way of
[56:30] seeing it and yet they peered into it
[56:32] and looking at it still are and you can
[56:34] look at it every day of your life and
[56:36] still not know the intent of purpose of
[56:39] God to manifest his goodness by the
[56:41] church. Now think not by angelic beings
[56:45] not by stars not by the moon not by the
[56:47] sun but through the church. So he's
[56:51] showing to the principalities and
[56:54] powers. Oh my. That he would reveal
[56:57] himself through the church, by the
[57:01] church. You got to be kidding me, Lord.
[57:02] You would do that to the intent that now
[57:05] unto the principalities and powers in
[57:08] heavenly places might be known by the
[57:13] church,
[57:15] the manifold wisdom of God. So by the
[57:20] church the manifold wisdom of God will
[57:24] be put on display in a way the stars
[57:28] cannot touch it to the intent now that
[57:31] he says that principalities and powers
[57:34] in the heavenly places might be made
[57:36] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[57:40] of God. I love the meaning of this word
[57:42] much variegated marked with a great
[57:46] variety of colors of cloth or a painting
[57:52] much varied. So the manifold wisdom if
[57:55] of God is literally this means much
[57:59] variegated. It means the greatly
[58:01] diversified wisdom of God is going to be
[58:05] expressed through the mystery of the
[58:07] church. And yet people say, "Oh my,
[58:10] well, the church, you know, you know,
[58:12] really need to even go to church." They
[58:13] don't even realize. They don't even
[58:15] realize what they are missing by not
[58:18] coming to the house of God where the
[58:20] saints of God are gathered together.
[58:22] Now, right here tonight, you know, here
[58:24] we are sitting in this place. How many
[58:26] of there are of us? And yet what God can
[58:28] do in this service is greater than
[58:31] keeping over 29 septillion stars in the
[58:36] visible universe which is that number
[58:39] with 24 zeros at the end of it. And all
[58:42] the laws that they operate by, all the
[58:45] laws in botney life, all the laws in
[58:47] animal life, all the laws in reptilian
[58:49] life, all the laws that are in the
[58:52] universe, and all the laws that are
[58:54] working inside your body, all the
[58:56] lymphatics and all the systems that you
[58:58] have in your body, and all that is great
[59:00] and magnificent and wonderful. And yet,
[59:02] the way God looks at it, the church is
[59:04] the greatest work of everything he's
[59:06] ever done. Yeah.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; And in the church, he would use
[59:10] variegated ways, many ways. So, it's
[59:13] like a great artist. And he doesn't just
[59:16] say, you know, how some of this modern
[59:17] art is. And Carol and I will go walking
[59:19] through DJ Maxx sometimes and just look
[59:21] there and I'm sitting there looking at
[59:22] it. And I I'll tell you how how great of
[59:24] an artist than I am. Whenever I was
[59:26] doing art class in school, my art and
[59:29] and everything that I did was in such
[59:31] bad shape, my art teacher would laugh.
[59:35] So that kind of tells you what kind of
[59:36] artist something. So I uh the other day
[59:38] we were somewhere and I told her I said
[59:40] you know what I mean it looked like
[59:42] somebody just took a can or something
[59:43] and went like that and then they took
[59:45] another jar and went this way and that
[59:47] way and they call that art. And I told
[59:49] her, I said, "I believe I could do some
[59:51] of that stuff cuz I look like that
[59:52] sometimes when I come in." That's where
[59:54] I've been painting. But yet God in his
[59:57] great artwork, so he has this color and
[59:59] that color and this design and this
[1:00:01] shape and this line and this spherical
[1:00:03] design and it has trapezoids and he has
[1:00:06] rectangles and he has squares and he has
[1:00:07] circles. He has half-D domes, he has
[1:00:09] commas, he has periods, he has
[1:00:11] semicolons, he has all this and then he
[1:00:13] has all this display of light and he has
[1:00:16] all this that shines from the light upon
[1:00:18] the colors. And then you look and said,
[1:00:20] "Oh my goodness, look at all them
[1:00:21] colors. Look at all that magnificent
[1:00:23] something there." And God said, and they
[1:00:25] said, "God, what do you call this work?
[1:00:27] Is it called the universe? Is it called
[1:00:29] this?" No, this work is called the
[1:00:33] church.
[1:00:35] And I say, "Really?
[1:00:37] You mean the people that the people that
[1:00:39] I work with, some of them that that I
[1:00:41] work with that I think is really weird
[1:00:42] and strange. You mean that that's part
[1:00:45] of that work there, the people that
[1:00:47] believe them strange things and dress
[1:00:49] different and act different from the
[1:00:50] world. And you mean that that is the
[1:00:52] greatest? Yes. This is my greatest
[1:00:54] masterpiece of all.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And it came of the outpouring out of
[1:01:03] this masterpiece here. This is my
[1:01:05] original begotten son masterpiece. And
[1:01:08] out of that he actually gave birth to
[1:01:11] this masterpiece here which is
[1:01:14] variegated down through seven
[1:01:15] dispensations and church ages. There are
[1:01:18] black, they are white, they're Japanese
[1:01:20] or Chinese, there's aboriginals, there's
[1:01:22] all types of people around the world.
[1:01:24] There's some that they're real calm,
[1:01:26] some that's more fiery. They got this
[1:01:28] and that. And yet every one of them pull
[1:01:31] on my grace and my mercy. Each one of
[1:01:34] them will pull out of me something that
[1:01:37] the stars could never meet.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; You see, I needed them to give me a
[1:01:44] reason and purpose of being.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Everybody take a deep breath now.
[1:01:57] So the wisdom of God is so diversified
[1:02:02] and so varied. So it's like variegating
[1:02:05] styles and shapes and patterns and
[1:02:10] colors and you've seen it before to
[1:02:12] where there somebody will show you
[1:02:14] something and you're looking at it and
[1:02:15] you can't see it at all and then they'll
[1:02:18] point it out to you and there's a man's
[1:02:20] face or this or that. You've seen those
[1:02:22] types of things, haven't you? And then
[1:02:23] once you see it, it's like you can't see
[1:02:27] anything else but that. Well, God hid
[1:02:30] the image of his bride inside such a
[1:02:35] place and a work of art and the world
[1:02:38] looks right at it and they say, "I I
[1:02:41] just don't see it. I just don't
[1:02:44] understand it." And they'll take their
[1:02:46] Baptist glass and their Methodist glass
[1:02:47] and Church of Christ and Church of God
[1:02:49] and Assembly of God, you know, whatever.
[1:02:50] And they're looking looking. I I I I
[1:02:53] just don't see it. I don't see it. And
[1:02:55] God said, "Can't you see that? It's as
[1:02:57] plain as the nose on my face, not
[1:02:59] theirs. It's a plain as the nose on my
[1:03:01] face. It's as plain as the shape of my
[1:03:04] eyes. It's as plain as the scars in my
[1:03:06] hand and the scars in my feet. Can't you
[1:03:09] see what it is?" And yet you look at
[1:03:12] say, "I see it. Glory to God. I see it."
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Others looking right at the same thing.
[1:03:17] You're looking say, "Are you crazy?
[1:03:19] You're out of your mind. You're under
[1:03:21] some spell. I don't doubt that we are
[1:03:23] the gospel, the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:25] Ghost, something got a hold of our
[1:03:27] heart. Amen. Is that right?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We wouldn't take nothing in this
[1:03:32] world for it because we believe that
[1:03:34] it's the truth. Now, this would event
[1:03:37] wisdom of God like nothing else. Watch
[1:03:40] again in Ephesians 3:11. And Paul said,
[1:03:42] according to the eternal purpose which
[1:03:45] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1:03:50] the eternal purpose one not purposes
[1:03:53] purpose according to the eternal purpose
[1:03:56] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
[1:03:59] Lord. So this great truth concerning the
[1:04:02] church was not made manifest in Moses.
[1:04:07] It couldn't be displayed in Jeremiah.
[1:04:10] There's only one place of safety
[1:04:13] transfer by which this revelation could
[1:04:16] come and that was Jesus Christ. Oh my.
[1:04:20] To ignore this truth, he says, is to sin
[1:04:23] against the father's image. This is why
[1:04:25] that it's he considers it such a penalty
[1:04:28] for those who speak against his bride.
[1:04:32] For those who persecute her, there will
[1:04:34] be people that will wind up being lost
[1:04:38] because of their treatment to God's
[1:04:41] bride.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; When I was sick, you didn't visit me.
[1:04:45] When I was in prison, you didn't come
[1:04:47] see me. Lord, when didn't we do this?
[1:04:50] When you didn't do it to the least of
[1:04:51] these my brothers, you didn't do it to
[1:04:53] me.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Why? They missed the picture. They
[1:04:58] missed the work, the greatest work of
[1:05:01] the artist himself. And a lot of it is
[1:05:03] hid in the mystery form of the
[1:05:06] variegated simplicity by which he
[1:05:08] reveals it and the people that he
[1:05:10] manifests it to. Oh, thank you, Lord
[1:05:13] Jesus. Now, watch this. I love the way
[1:05:16] the prophet says this. in the future
[1:05:17] home. You see, you were made for an
[1:05:20] eternal purpose because you was the
[1:05:23] manifestation of an attribute that was
[1:05:26] in God that thought, oh, hallelujah, of
[1:05:30] you and expressed you and made a earth
[1:05:35] to take you out of.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Do you realize you're not made for the
[1:05:40] earth? The earth was made to give you a
[1:05:44] body.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. The earth was made to give God a
[1:05:48] human body himself. It never had a
[1:05:50] permanent residence, a flesh body until
[1:05:53] Jesus come on the earth. And he said,
[1:05:55] "Out of this, I will take my body and
[1:05:58] from this I will redeem the rest of it."
[1:06:02] Now watch the thought that thought of
[1:06:04] you and expressed you and made an earth
[1:06:07] to take you out of and make you a human
[1:06:10] being and sin came along. notice and
[1:06:14] perverted his way. You come anyhow, but
[1:06:17] you was lost with the world. So he come
[1:06:22] and redeems you. The expressed
[1:06:25] attribute. Hallelujah. And also redeems
[1:06:29] the earth the same way. Then his purpose
[1:06:33] rolls on. Oh hallelujah. He said, see
[1:06:37] that does me so much good to think of
[1:06:41] what lays ahead. Who is Melzdc? Being
[1:06:44] eternal with him at the beginning, the
[1:06:48] eternal life that you had. His thought
[1:06:52] of you. Come on church, let's have
[1:06:54] meeting tonight. What do you say? His
[1:06:57] thought of what you was only he wanted
[1:07:00] me to stand in the pulpit. Say he wanted
[1:07:03] you to sit in the seat tonight. Then we
[1:07:07] are serving his eternal purpose.
[1:07:10] So you mean us coming to church and
[1:07:14] sitting in the house of God is serving
[1:07:17] God's eternal purpose?
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; I just don't get it for those who said
[1:07:21] we don't need to meet no more.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. That's contrary
[1:07:27] to what Malachi 4 said.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Now, you believe whatever you wish to
[1:07:31] believe. You don't think it's important,
[1:07:32] that's up to you. But remember, all
[1:07:34] these going to church quotes will meet
[1:07:36] you at that day.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Notice now. Oh,
[1:07:41] hallelujah. And the only one that left
[1:07:44] home is the only one to come to serve
[1:07:48] his purpose. Is that right? All right.
[1:07:50] Then after it's finished, it's brought
[1:07:52] back in a glorified state. It's matured
[1:07:57] and brought back again. Now, hang on
[1:08:00] tight with me in this one. In the
[1:08:02] Ephesians church age, the church age
[1:08:04] book, God being a savior, it was
[1:08:08] necessary that he predestinate a man who
[1:08:12] would require salvation in order to give
[1:08:16] himself reason and purpose
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; of being.
[1:08:26] I was the reason.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; His one only reason.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; He needed a reason, a purpose
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; of being,
[1:08:41] the eternal.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; He needed a reason. Oh, what about it,
[1:08:48] church? Are you part of that reason?
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:53] This is in your diary, little bride.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my. God being a savior. I'm going to
[1:09:00] read it again. All the rest of them
[1:09:02] devils that didn't pass out the first
[1:09:03] time. Maybe it'll hit him this time. It
[1:09:05] was necessary that he predestinate a man
[1:09:09] who would require salvation in order,
[1:09:13] hallelujah, in order to give himself
[1:09:16] reason and purpose of being. That is
[1:09:20] 100% correct. and multitudes of
[1:09:23] scripture bear it out as does the very
[1:09:26] pointed verse in Romans 11:36. For of
[1:09:30] him and through him and to him are all
[1:09:34] things to whom be glory forever. Amen.
[1:09:38] Man could not directly come and partake
[1:09:41] of that tree of life in the garden of
[1:09:43] Eden. Now listen, if there's anybody
[1:09:44] struggling with serpent sate, hopefully
[1:09:46] this will help you. That eternal life of
[1:09:48] the tree had to become flesh first. But
[1:09:53] before God
[1:09:56] could raise and save a sinner, he had to
[1:09:59] have a sinner
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; to raise and save.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Man had to fall.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; But God couldn't make him c fall and
[1:10:09] then reach down and pick him up and say,
[1:10:11] "Oh, now I'm a savior." But God made a
[1:10:14] way where he could and it would all be
[1:10:16] just. The fall which would be caused by
[1:10:20] Satan had to have flesh to make the
[1:10:24] fall. Satan had to come through flesh
[1:10:27] also. And but Satan could not come
[1:10:30] through human flesh to make the fall as
[1:10:33] would Christ come in human flesh to
[1:10:35] restore the fallen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; He goes on down a few few lines in this
[1:10:41] paragraph. What God worked out here in
[1:10:43] the Garden of Eden was his predestinated
[1:10:46] plan. And when Satan had brought about
[1:10:50] that which was necessary
[1:10:54] to the purpose of God.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:11:00] Did you hear that? I like to taunt you
[1:11:03] with that quote.
[1:11:06] When Satan brought about that which was
[1:11:10] necessary to the purpose of God. Oh, we
[1:11:14] think the devil is all powerful and he
[1:11:17] can do this and that and the other. He
[1:11:19] ain't got no power. Come on, somebody.
[1:11:21] The only weapon that the devil is God is
[1:11:24] to make you doubt your weapon. He ain't
[1:11:26] got power to do this. He's not
[1:11:28] omnipotent. He's not omnipresent. He
[1:11:30] doesn't have omniscience. He doesn't
[1:11:32] have any of that. And a lot of times he
[1:11:34] don't even know how victorious he is
[1:11:36] until we open our mouth and tell him,
[1:11:38] "Well, I'm so low. I'm down. I'm
[1:11:40] defeated. I'm this." Why don't you shut
[1:11:42] up that garbage? You ain't going to find
[1:11:44] that trash inside your diary, little
[1:11:47] bride. God wants you to talk like who
[1:11:49] you are. You are the queen of heaven.
[1:11:52] God wants you to talk like a redeemed
[1:11:54] person. You're not some piece of trash.
[1:11:57] You might have been before he found you,
[1:11:59] but you ain't tonight. Don't you tell me
[1:12:01] you ain't no cow. The Lord Jesus gave
[1:12:04] his life for you. Amen. I wish somebody
[1:12:07] would have church with me tonight. Don't
[1:12:09] you tell me you're worthless. That's a
[1:12:11] lie.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; I said that's a lie. Don't you come to
[1:12:14] me with that trash and nonsense. Don't
[1:12:16] you tell me you're worthless. He gave
[1:12:18] his life for you.
[1:12:22] Woo.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; And when Satan had brought about that
[1:12:29] which was necessary to the purpose of
[1:12:31] God, then man could not get to the tree
[1:12:34] of life in the garden. Certainly not. It
[1:12:37] wasn't time.
[1:12:40] Then there was to come a day when God
[1:12:42] would appear in flesh and by means of
[1:12:45] his humiliation,
[1:12:48] he would restore fallen man and make him
[1:12:51] a partaker of that life eternal. Once
[1:12:56] you see this, you can understand the
[1:12:58] serpent seed and know that it was no
[1:13:00] apple that he ate. It was degradation of
[1:13:04] humanity by intermingling the seed. And
[1:13:09] the church said, Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Some church 8, this choosing of the
[1:13:14] bride was purposed in himself. Ephesians
[1:13:18] 1:9 and in Romans 9:11, it says that the
[1:13:21] purpose of God according to election
[1:13:24] might stand. Well, glory to God, brother
[1:13:26] Donnie, I come from a free will Baptist
[1:13:29] background. Well, you need to get that
[1:13:30] background out of you. It ain't your
[1:13:33] free will. Come on, you might as well
[1:13:35] say amen to it. Your free will is not my
[1:13:37] free will. That's what's got me in so
[1:13:39] much trouble all of my life. Oh yeah,
[1:13:41] our free will. This you make an idol out
[1:13:43] of your free will. What you need to do
[1:13:45] is surrender your free will out of your
[1:13:47] stupidity into the will of God and say,
[1:13:49] "Lord, I've made an absolute mess out of
[1:13:51] my life. I've made so many stupid
[1:13:53] decisions and I've done this and that
[1:13:54] and the other and where God can lead you
[1:13:57] as a little lamb." Come on, church. We
[1:14:00] got too many goat natured people sitting
[1:14:02] around the church. Oh my. Jack Co,
[1:14:05] brother, brother Nathan Bryan sent me a
[1:14:07] quote. Jack Low and he's preaching it
[1:14:08] years ago back in the 50s. And he said
[1:14:10] the church, oh, he said, is getting so
[1:14:13] cold and indifferent. Ain't got the
[1:14:14] power of God no more. They've got to
[1:14:16] have chicken dinners and chicken
[1:14:18] suppers, he said. And they have to have
[1:14:20] ice cream suppers and they have to have
[1:14:22] sweet tea. And Jack Co went on to say,
[1:14:24] "And they're as dead as the chicken,
[1:14:26] cold as the ice cream, and watered down
[1:14:28] as the tea they're drinking." He said,
[1:14:30] "We need some people filled with the
[1:14:32] Holy Ghost." I say the same thing in the
[1:14:34] age we're living right now. We don't
[1:14:36] want a bunch of dead chicken cold ice
[1:14:38] cream, weak, sweet tea people. We want
[1:14:41] people filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:43] People that still believe God's word.
[1:14:45] Hallelujah. Is the same that he has not
[1:14:48] changed. Amen. And we are part of that
[1:14:51] bride before the foundation of the
[1:14:53] world. And there is nothing in hell that
[1:14:55] can stop us. There is nothing on this
[1:14:58] earth that can stop us. We are his
[1:15:00] elected.
[1:15:03] That's what I find in my diary case.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Woo! Praise the Lord. You can't read it
[1:15:12] in any other way. The heart purpose, the
[1:15:17] eternal purpose of God was to take a
[1:15:21] bride
[1:15:23] of his own choosing. Amen.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; So, how many of your brothers in here
[1:15:30] let your daddy pick out your wife?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; What about your mama?
[1:15:39] What about Uncle Ralph? Ain't Susie?
[1:15:42] Ain't him.
[1:15:46] You let your grandpa pick out your wife.
[1:15:48] What about grandma?
[1:15:51] Well, some of you men would be mad on a
[1:15:53] hornet if your daddy said, "You're
[1:15:55] marrying that girl." You say, "I don't
[1:15:56] like that girl. I don't care if you like
[1:15:58] her or not. You're marrying her."
[1:16:00] Yet, we'll tell God that. God, you got
[1:16:03] to marry this one. You got to marry
[1:16:04] that. No, he don't. He picks his own
[1:16:08] wife.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, brothers. I love my daddy and I
[1:16:12] love my mama, but I didn't want them
[1:16:14] telling me who I was going to live with
[1:16:15] the rest of my life. Amen. I wanted
[1:16:18] something inside of me to testify and it
[1:16:21] did. Thank the Lord. But that's the same
[1:16:23] way the Lord Jesus feels. Yet the church
[1:16:25] said, "You've got to marry this church.
[1:16:27] You've got to take that one. You got to
[1:16:28] marry this one. We don't care. We don't
[1:16:30] dress right and we don't do this that.
[1:16:32] But you got to marry us anyhow. I'm not
[1:16:34] sure who you think you're talking to,
[1:16:36] but you're not talking to my heavenly
[1:16:37] father." He picks who he wants to marry.
[1:16:40] Come on, somebody. He picks who he wants
[1:16:42] to live in that heavenly city with him
[1:16:45] through eternity. He ordains his
[1:16:47] prophets. He picks his own preachers. He
[1:16:49] picks his men that are ordained to
[1:16:51] preach the gospel. You and I don't get
[1:16:53] to do it on our own choosing. Amen. He
[1:16:56] was the one that chose it. Hell can't
[1:16:58] stop it. Hallelujah. The earth can't
[1:17:00] stop it. Organizations can't stop it. He
[1:17:03] chose his own bride.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:09] Amen. He is the one who chooses them.
[1:17:12] Notice this. This purpose was in himself
[1:17:17] being eternal was decreed
[1:17:20] before the foundation of the world.
[1:17:24] Watch carefully now and see this. Before
[1:17:28] there was ever a speck of stardust.
[1:17:33] before God was God.
[1:17:39] God is an object of adoration and no one
[1:17:42] was there to worship him. So he was only
[1:17:45] at that time potentially
[1:17:48] God.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Boy, that blow theologian's mind,
[1:17:53] wouldn't it? Potentially God.
[1:17:58] Hallelujah.
[1:18:00] He wasn't even God yet cuz there was
[1:18:03] nothing to worship him.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So he was at that time only
[1:18:09] potentially God. He was known only as
[1:18:13] eternal spirit.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; The bride
[1:18:19] was already
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; in his.
[1:18:28] The bride was already in his mind,
[1:18:32] existing
[1:18:36] in his thoughts.
[1:18:38] Now remember, not a body, but in his
[1:18:41] thoughts. If I was there in his
[1:18:43] thoughts, the body will come.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; The bride was already in his mind. Yes,
[1:18:49] she was. She was existing
[1:18:54] in his thoughts. And what about those
[1:18:58] thoughts of God? They are eternal. Are
[1:19:03] they not?
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, you see, God did have a secret,
[1:19:09] but it's let out.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; It ain't a secret no more. Not to those
[1:19:16] who are in the mystery of the secret.
[1:19:19] Now watch again in Ephesians 3:12. Paul
[1:19:22] said, "In whom we have," notice now,
[1:19:24] bride, what you have. This is for your
[1:19:27] journey. In whom we have boldness
[1:19:31] and access with confidence by the faith
[1:19:37] of him. Lord have mercy. What a verse.
[1:19:40] Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; We have boldness
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; and access with confidence
[1:19:48] by the faith of him, not faith in him.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; His own faith.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; If you're really saved tonight and
[1:19:57] filled with the Holy Ghost, you know how
[1:19:58] you got it? The Lord God dropped it into
[1:20:00] you his own faith and give you the
[1:20:02] ability to believe what you could not
[1:20:03] believe.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Remember 1952, believe in God. The
[1:20:06] prophet said God spoke a word and God
[1:20:08] believed his own word and God and you
[1:20:10] will believe his own word. Even when the
[1:20:12] flesh says I don't understand it, I
[1:20:14] can't make no sense out of it. That
[1:20:15] don't matter. The faith of Jesus inside
[1:20:17] your soul will say amen to the promise
[1:20:19] of God. Amen. He's God. He cannot lie.
[1:20:23] In whom we have boldness. Look at this
[1:20:26] word boldness. Confidence. Freedom in
[1:20:29] speaking openly, frankly, free and
[1:20:33] fearless. Confidence. cheerful courage,
[1:20:37] boldness and assurance
[1:20:40] in whom we have boldness with access. Oh
[1:20:44] my, with access with confidence by the
[1:20:48] face of him. So the Lord Jesus is the
[1:20:52] way of our access. Our access. You see,
[1:20:56] it was Isaac's need for Rebecca is how
[1:21:01] Rebecca had access to ride the camel
[1:21:04] train back home.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; She would have had no access. There's
[1:21:08] all kinds of other girls there. There's
[1:21:10] all kinds of other women. They did not
[1:21:12] have access to the same power she had
[1:21:15] access to. Now, them camels brought all
[1:21:17] them gifts, but they had to have spare
[1:21:19] room now for her and for her maid girls
[1:21:21] going back with her. And she had access
[1:21:24] to ride that power back to the place it
[1:21:27] come from. Oh, hallelujah. Not to just
[1:21:30] say, "Glory to God, I feel it. Amen.
[1:21:31] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm saved.
[1:21:33] Once in grace, always in grace." No.
[1:21:35] Rebecca had more than once in grace,
[1:21:37] always in grace.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; She had boldness with access into
[1:21:42] Isaac's presence, and he's going to take
[1:21:45] her into his mother's tent, and she
[1:21:48] would become his wife. So she had access
[1:21:52] to him and that opened the door where he
[1:21:55] would have access to her. I hope
[1:21:57] somebody's hearing me tonight.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? The Lord Jesus
[1:22:01] don't have access to a lot of the church
[1:22:03] people friends. They won't even let him
[1:22:05] in their closet. They won't let him in
[1:22:07] their music library. They won't let him
[1:22:09] in the movies they watch. They watch all
[1:22:11] kinds of filth and trash and nonsense.
[1:22:13] Now Lord Jesus, you leave me alone. You
[1:22:15] saved me from hell, but you leave my
[1:22:17] entertainment alone. I'm going to do
[1:22:18] what I want to do now. If I'm going to
[1:22:20] drink a little bit every now and then,
[1:22:21] that's that's my issue. That that's up
[1:22:23] to me. But I want you to save me now.
[1:22:25] But the Lord Jesus wants access to every
[1:22:28] avenue of the bride's life.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; And if he wants it, he's going to get
[1:22:32] it.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; "So Christ is our way of access." So the
[1:22:39] father Abraham sends the servant on
[1:22:42] behalf of the son. The son's need opens
[1:22:47] up the door of access by which Rebecca
[1:22:51] can come down and fulfill this need. Now
[1:22:54] remember, his mother had been gone now
[1:22:56] for some time and he's needing that
[1:22:58] feminist part. He was living alone.
[1:23:04] He was living alone. There was no one
[1:23:08] that could console him. No one could
[1:23:11] comfort him. No one could come to him.
[1:23:13] Oh no, no doubt there was women all
[1:23:15] through there everywhere. But remember
[1:23:17] Abraham gave him the strict absolute
[1:23:19] restriction. Do not take a woman from
[1:23:22] the daughters amongst these people that
[1:23:24] I live in these denominations.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Don't you do it. You go back to my
[1:23:30] people. Don't you understand, friends?
[1:23:32] That's what we're preaching for. We're
[1:23:33] trying to find his people.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; He found some in Johnson City. He's
[1:23:38] found some in Canada. He's found some in
[1:23:40] Japan. He's found some in, you know, all
[1:23:41] these other places. That's what
[1:23:43] ministers of the gospel are doing.
[1:23:45] They're trying to find his people. Well,
[1:23:48] praise God.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Notice this now in Ephesians 3:13.
[1:23:51] Wherefore, I desire that you faint not
[1:23:55] at my tribulations
[1:23:57] for you, which is
[1:24:00] your glory.
[1:24:02] After he mentions these great mysterious
[1:24:06] things,
[1:24:07] now he brings in suffering and
[1:24:10] heartache.
[1:24:12] and difficulty.
[1:24:14] Why these deposits in the dowy was going
[1:24:18] to help them understand verse 13 the
[1:24:22] necessity of these things. I I'm going
[1:24:26] through all of this but it's for your
[1:24:28] all's glory. He said wherefore I desire
[1:24:31] that you faint not at my tribulations
[1:24:35] for you. Now notice, not just for the
[1:24:38] Lord Jesus, but Paul was going through
[1:24:41] much tribulation for the people of God.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Why? He was an example. He was a leader
[1:24:48] and a leader that cannot be tried and go
[1:24:50] through basically hell on this earth. He
[1:24:52] ain't a God called leader in the first
[1:24:54] place. A preacher that's got to be
[1:24:57] babyed and petted and made over all the
[1:25:00] time and looking for the easy way out.
[1:25:02] That man need a bit more call than I'm a
[1:25:04] jack rabbit with with microphone on.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; If he's a God called man, he's ordained
[1:25:09] of God to suffer. If he's a God called
[1:25:12] man, he's ordained of God to fight hell.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; And he will do it.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; And he's not only doing it for the Lord
[1:25:20] Jesus, he's doing it for the people that
[1:25:23] he's called to minister to, whether it's
[1:25:25] a pastor, an evangelist, a teacher,
[1:25:27] whatever. And the church said,
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; you see, our present conditions does not
[1:25:33] change our position or our inheritance.
[1:25:37] It only magnifies it in a greater sense.
[1:25:40] So remember now that Ephesians parallels
[1:25:43] Joshua. Remember the prophet said that
[1:25:45] over and over again that Ephesians
[1:25:47] parallels Joshua. So in Ephesians is
[1:25:49] some of the deepest mysteries of the
[1:25:51] church in the book of Ephesians. But
[1:25:53] also in the book of Ephesians are some
[1:25:55] of the words about tribulation and tests
[1:25:58] and trials. Why? It absolutely mirrored
[1:26:01] Joshua in the Old Testament. So the
[1:26:03] children are getting their land, but
[1:26:04] they're fighting for absolutely every
[1:26:06] inch of the ground they get.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; God's got all these promises in your
[1:26:10] little case, little bride, with all your
[1:26:12] dowy promises, but you'll fight for
[1:26:14] every inch you get in the kingdom of
[1:26:15] God. Not only that, but after you get
[1:26:18] it, you'll fight to keep what you fought
[1:26:20] to get. Come on, somebody. So you say,
[1:26:22] "Well, when do I quit fighting? Whenever
[1:26:24] you die or whenever we're raptured,
[1:26:27] whichever comes first." Amen.
[1:26:31] Now, you know, this was a very, very
[1:26:33] difficult thing, no doubt, for them to
[1:26:34] process. But yet, he tells them, "Don't
[1:26:37] be discouraged." Even tells them not to
[1:26:39] faint. Don't don't don't faint. Because
[1:26:42] remember what Paul's at when he writes
[1:26:44] this Roman prison. Yeah,
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; I stood there a few years ago.
[1:26:53] A cave, a hole down in the ground in the
[1:26:56] earth and a hole in the top where they
[1:26:59] drop his food and his water down.
[1:27:04] Now, how would that affect you if your
[1:27:07] church age messenger was thrown in
[1:27:10] prison?
[1:27:12] Would you still followed him?
[1:27:14] You imagine all the critics in that day?
[1:27:17] Oh, hey, I I hear your your your your
[1:27:19] church age messenger guy. I hear he's
[1:27:21] he's doing another term in prison.
[1:27:25] Uh what does this make now? Twice, three
[1:27:27] times that he's been in prison and he
[1:27:29] goes in and gets out. There's something
[1:27:31] there's something wrong with that man.
[1:27:32] You mark my words, I'm telling you
[1:27:34] there's something wrong with that man.
[1:27:35] One of these days he'll get killed and
[1:27:36] that'll prove to you ain't nothing other
[1:27:37] but the devil. That didn't prove it at
[1:27:39] all. Cut his head off. They believed he
[1:27:41] was a saint of God and we believe the
[1:27:43] same thing.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; But how would it have affected you in
[1:27:46] the first century if you would have been
[1:27:48] there and you got the latest update that
[1:27:49] Paul was in prison again?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, even when they would let Paul
[1:27:55] out and they assigned a prisoner or
[1:27:58] guard rather that would come and be
[1:28:00] chained to Paul.
[1:28:03] So when Paul would go eat breakfast,
[1:28:05] that guard was sitting at the table.
[1:28:08] When Paul would go to preach, that guard
[1:28:12] would stand up in the pullpit with him.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; He was chained.
[1:28:18] Oh my. What would you have thought? You
[1:28:22] to come to the service to hear this
[1:28:23] great man of God speak the word and this
[1:28:27] is your first time and hearing him and
[1:28:28] you, oh, you're so excited. Oh, I can't
[1:28:31] wait. And you look up there in the
[1:28:32] pulpit and there's two guys and one of
[1:28:34] them's a Roman.
[1:28:37] And you're saying, "What's that guy?
[1:28:41] Is that an interpreter?"
[1:28:43] It's a Roman guard. What
[1:28:47] you mean to tell me this man is so sorry
[1:28:49] and low down that he's got to have a
[1:28:51] guard around with him everywhere he
[1:28:53] goes?
[1:28:55] What was it? The prisoner was chained.
[1:28:59] But you imagine Paul getting so excited
[1:29:00] every now and then he want to clap his
[1:29:02] hands he said let me have your hand.
[1:29:04] That old Roman would have to you know
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; that's what you need to do sometime to
[1:29:10] that Roman you're chained to
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; cuz every one of us tonight have got a
[1:29:14] Roman. But the part difficult part about
[1:29:16] it is he looks just like you or she
[1:29:19] does. Looks just like you. It'll tell
[1:29:22] you you've worked hard today. You're too
[1:29:24] tired to praise God. You prayed all
[1:29:26] these prayers and none of them have been
[1:29:28] answered. And that old Roman trying to
[1:29:29] whisper in your ear. It's that Romans in
[1:29:31] Romans chapter 7. That old man. Come on,
[1:29:34] somebody.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know I got in trouble years ago
[1:29:37] for preaching it that way, but that's
[1:29:39] exactly the way Paul taught it. That's
[1:29:40] the way God's prophet taught it. And I
[1:29:42] teach it the same way. But aren't you
[1:29:44] glad? Remember, it comes from the story
[1:29:46] of Mezantius written many, many years
[1:29:49] ago. And Mezantius was a tyrant of a
[1:29:52] king. And whenever he would go in and
[1:29:54] conquer a city or conquer a region, then
[1:29:56] he would command the prisoners to be
[1:29:58] taken and they would take a dead corpse
[1:30:02] and chain that to the living people and
[1:30:05] they were forbidden by law of death for
[1:30:09] you to take that off. You went to the
[1:30:11] grocery store, you pull this dead corpse
[1:30:14] around. You went wherever you went. You
[1:30:17] had this dead corpse that you were
[1:30:19] chained to a rotten, putrified stench.
[1:30:22] Nobody wouldn't want to be around you.
[1:30:24] Nobody wouldn't want to come and shake
[1:30:26] your hand. Why? Chained to a dead man.
[1:30:29] Open your eyes tonight. Word of life.
[1:30:30] Church, you and I are still chained to a
[1:30:33] dead man or a dead woman.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Oh, it don't have
[1:30:37] dominance cuz it ain't got life in it no
[1:30:39] more. But yet, it's there to haunt us.
[1:30:41] It's there sometime that it causing no
[1:30:44] stench in our nose and you'll make a
[1:30:46] mistake and mess up as much as you love
[1:30:48] God. And you think, God, how in the
[1:30:50] world could I do such a thing? Cuz
[1:30:52] you're chained to a dead man. Oh my. But
[1:30:55] Paul said, "Who shall deliver me from
[1:30:59] the body of this death?" But thanks be
[1:31:02] to God who giveth us the victory through
[1:31:05] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:13] Oh, you see why some of you didn't clap
[1:31:14] your hands and some of them didn't clap
[1:31:15] very good cuz that Roman didn't want to
[1:31:17] clap.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; So, you was pulling on that Roman's
[1:31:20] hand. So, you just gave a little petite.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that Roman said, "Don't
[1:31:28] raise my hand up. I ain't a believer.
[1:31:30] Don't you take my hand up." You imagine
[1:31:33] Paul getting excited. The preacher,
[1:31:34] well, glory to God. That Roman said,
[1:31:35] "Don't do that. I don't believe what you
[1:31:39] believe. I ain't no Christian. I don't
[1:31:42] believe this Christianity. Step Paul
[1:31:44] said, "I need your hand." Don't you
[1:31:46] understand? Your soul ain't got a hand.
[1:31:48] It needs yours.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your soul don't have lips to be
[1:31:53] able to speak out. Glory to God. So the
[1:31:55] soul says, "Donnie, can I borrow your
[1:31:57] mouth?" Amen. Donnie, can I borrow your
[1:32:01] hand? Donnie, can I borrow your feet? Or
[1:32:03] I can dance around a little bit tonight.
[1:32:05] But we're so chained and so wrapped up.
[1:32:10] Hallelujah.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[1:32:13] I can't I can't move.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Does everybody worship the
[1:32:20] Lord?
[1:32:23] Let me turn around so y'all can see me.
[1:32:26] Oh, I got wild tonight. I got wild in
[1:32:28] church. I batt in my eyes.
[1:32:33] I ain't had a spell like that since
[1:32:35] Moses cross the Red Sea.
[1:32:40] Take control of that Roman of yours.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Let that Roman know what good
[1:32:46] oldfashioned Pentecostal hand clapping
[1:32:48] is all about.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:55] Forget that little petite modern idea of
[1:32:58] all that stuff. You imagine Paul and
[1:33:00] Silas down in jail and Paul's saying,
[1:33:02] "Oh, Silas, what do you think about it,
[1:33:04] man? I don't know. This is pretty risky
[1:33:06] stuff. You think why to quit preaching?
[1:33:07] I'm thinking about coming off the field,
[1:33:09] ain't you? I'm thinking about resigning
[1:33:10] in my position. How you going to resign
[1:33:11] a call of a prophet of God? But they
[1:33:14] begin to sing and my the longer they
[1:33:16] sung, the happier they got to feel it.
[1:33:18] And God up there in heaven began to
[1:33:19] pound his foot in his head. Woo! Glory.
[1:33:21] Come on, boys. Praise me. Praise me. God
[1:33:24] loves for you to praise him when you're
[1:33:26] driving a new car. He loves for you to
[1:33:28] praise him when your bills are all paid.
[1:33:30] But I'll tell you what really moves his
[1:33:31] heart is when you praise him and it
[1:33:34] don't seem like you've got nothing to
[1:33:36] praise him for. But you raise your
[1:33:38] hands, you lift your voice, you go to
[1:33:40] church anyhow, and you let hell know
[1:33:43] where you stand.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; So he tells them, "Look, children, don't
[1:33:57] be troubled.
[1:33:59] I know it hurts your heart.
[1:34:02] You know, some of the believers would
[1:34:03] get to come down and look down that hole
[1:34:06] where he was Paul.
[1:34:10] Bless you, brother.
[1:34:12] So sorry you're having to go through
[1:34:14] this. You imagine looking, that's okay.
[1:34:20] That's okay.
[1:34:21] God's got a reason for it.
[1:34:24] You imagine what a place not sitting in
[1:34:27] a study, Harry. not sitting in an air
[1:34:29] conditioned room and write the book of
[1:34:31] Ephesians,
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; but in a stinking Roman prison.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Having to use the bathroom where he
[1:34:41] slept
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; in his own squalor and filth
[1:34:50] and they drop his own molded bread down
[1:34:53] from the top and laugh at him.
[1:34:56] Hey, you still got the victory?
[1:35:00] Yes, sir. I sure do. Have you?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Next day, same thing. Next day, same
[1:35:08] thing. Next day, same thing. Why? Oh,
[1:35:11] hallelujah. He brought that old prisoner
[1:35:13] in subjection to the new life
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; on the inside. He was reconciled to it.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; God had dropped that in his heart.
[1:35:24] This is beneficial.
[1:35:26] for my children. Oh.
[1:35:31] Oh, okay.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes. Yes. I'm good with it then.
[1:35:37] So, you haven't forgotten me? Of course
[1:35:39] not.
[1:35:41] You You still love me? You still care
[1:35:43] for me? Absolutely.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; But I prayed for so many nights for my
[1:35:48] own deliverance. I prayed for your
[1:35:49] children and seen them delivered of all
[1:35:50] kinds of things. And I prayed for my own
[1:35:52] deliverance and you haven't done it.
[1:35:58] Ephesians 3:14, "For this cause I bow my
[1:36:01] knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
[1:36:04] Christ, of whom the whole family
[1:36:09] in heaven and earth is named."
[1:36:15] Wow. I mean, he's in a family way, ain't
[1:36:18] he? He's just talking about the family
[1:36:19] of God. And you'd think everything was
[1:36:21] fine.
[1:36:23] I wonder how he would even eat, friends.
[1:36:27] How would you even eat with your human
[1:36:30] refuge there and the stench
[1:36:33] and the squalor and the rats
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; and the bugs of the darkness, the
[1:36:39] cockroaches
[1:36:41] running over your body,
[1:36:45] and we complain of what things we go
[1:36:48] through.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; God forgive us, bunch of babies. Amen.
[1:36:52] Amen.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Now listen how he says of whom the whole
[1:36:56] family in heaven earth is named that he
[1:36:59] would grant you
[1:37:01] according to the riches
[1:37:04] of his glory to be strengthened with
[1:37:07] mighty
[1:37:09] by his spirit
[1:37:11] in the inner man. Yeah.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Now, this is not the smiley preacher
[1:37:16] sitting down in Houston
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; with his multi-million dollar house and
[1:37:21] all of his cars and all of his swimming
[1:37:23] pools and all of his great fabulous
[1:37:25] stuff around him.
[1:37:28] But a man living in squalor and filth
[1:37:32] and yet talking about riches.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; According to the riches of his glory.
[1:37:42] according to the glorious abundance of
[1:37:45] his mercies. Can't y'all can't you
[1:37:47] saints see at Ephesus? It's not this
[1:37:49] current life. This is what he's trying
[1:37:51] to get them to see. What the diary look
[1:37:53] look for. They're fixing to face a
[1:37:55] journey.
[1:37:57] There's many more Christians outside the
[1:37:59] Roman jail. They're going to be burned
[1:38:01] at crosses.
[1:38:04] The mothers are going to have their
[1:38:05] babies ripped out of their belly and
[1:38:07] their brains dashed against rocks.
[1:38:11] They're going to need something to help
[1:38:13] them.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; He's filling their dowy chest
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; and letting them know, children, it's
[1:38:20] not all about this life.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; It's not about how comfortable
[1:38:24] everything is and how good everything
[1:38:26] is. The riches are so wonderful, but
[1:38:29] many of them are yet to come.
[1:38:34] And yet
[1:38:36] he says, "I want you to be strengthened
[1:38:38] with might."
[1:38:40] I love the choice of words there. To be
[1:38:42] powerfully strengthened, that is to give
[1:38:44] you abundant strength to bear trials, to
[1:38:46] perform your duties, to glorify his
[1:38:49] name.
[1:38:51] Human power is unable to be able to
[1:38:53] achieve such a thing. But he said, "May
[1:38:55] the spirit of God by his spirit
[1:38:59] strengthen the inner man." This man has
[1:39:02] experienced this.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; And if you and I would have been one of
[1:39:07] the privileged few that would have been
[1:39:09] able to come down the steps in the
[1:39:10] Mormonine and went down to be able to
[1:39:13] send him, Brother Rob, we would have
[1:39:14] probably had to put a rag over our face
[1:39:18] to keep from getting sick and vomiting
[1:39:22] at the body odor
[1:39:25] of our church age messenger.
[1:39:31] God forgive us
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; sometimes. Don't you just feel like a
[1:39:36] baby, a spoiled brat?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him tonight?
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Verse 17. That Christ
[1:39:50] may dwell in your hearts by faith.
[1:39:53] that ye being rooted
[1:39:56] and grounded in love.
[1:39:59] Now, wait a minute.
[1:40:02] Why isn't he talking about the size of
[1:40:04] the rats
[1:40:06] and the stench and the smell and how
[1:40:08] that he got sick of his stomach trying
[1:40:10] to eat that crusty bread and all that he
[1:40:12] was going through and all that he went
[1:40:14] through and all that he gave up and all
[1:40:15] this and all that and all that. But
[1:40:17] instead of doing that, he mentions it,
[1:40:20] brother Benton. And then he goes on to
[1:40:22] give the bride what she needed for her
[1:40:25] journey. So instead of focusing on
[1:40:27] himself
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; and focusing on on how hard it was
[1:40:33] that Christ may dwell on your hearts by
[1:40:35] faith, that ye been rooted and grounded
[1:40:38] in love, may be able to comprehend with
[1:40:41] all saints what is the breadth, length,
[1:40:46] depths,
[1:40:48] and height.
[1:40:51] strange word that he used here may be
[1:40:53] fully able breadth, length, depth,
[1:40:57] height, the full dimensions
[1:41:00] of the spiritual temple. Now remember
[1:41:03] where they were here, the first
[1:41:06] foundation level had been laid
[1:41:10] face.
[1:41:12] So the length, the breadth, the height.
[1:41:15] Notice what he's doing. He's declaring
[1:41:18] a building,
[1:41:20] the full dimensions of the spiritual
[1:41:23] temple, answering to the very cry of
[1:41:27] God. So then in full, when it would come
[1:41:31] to pass, it would reproduce again on the
[1:41:34] earth the very fullness
[1:41:37] of the Lord Jesus.
[1:41:41] Amen.
[1:41:44] and to know the love of Christ
[1:41:49] which passes knowledge that you might be
[1:41:52] filled
[1:41:55] now that he's described the dimensions
[1:41:58] that you might be filled with all the
[1:42:02] fullness of God. The immensity
[1:42:06] of such redeeming love.
[1:42:10] I wonder how how much he was hurting.
[1:42:13] You imagine that cold, damp place,
[1:42:15] Brother Rob, being in there and how it
[1:42:17] would affect his body,
[1:42:19] not being in the sunlight, vitamin C
[1:42:22] being low, ricketetts of course develop
[1:42:25] in a place like that.
[1:42:28] And on the occasion when they would
[1:42:30] bring him out, it take him forever for
[1:42:33] his eyes to be able to see
[1:42:35] cuz he couldn't see.
[1:42:38] And they lead him around out in the
[1:42:39] courtyard a little bit and say, "Hey,
[1:42:41] you. Ain't you the God that sees
[1:42:43] visions?"
[1:42:45] Where's that God you're talking about?
[1:42:49] Well, I guess he's forsaken you, huh?
[1:42:52] He's not the God of the dungeon.
[1:42:54] I guess he's a God up on that first
[1:42:56] level up there, but down below that
[1:42:58] level there, you're you're down. You
[1:43:00] ain't got no more power, have you? Why
[1:43:02] don't you smite me blind, you hypocrite?
[1:43:10] I wonder children how we're going to
[1:43:12] stand when we stand beside people like
[1:43:14] that at that day.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, I feel like
[1:43:22] stopping and just making an altar call.
[1:43:23] May be the first one in the altar.
[1:43:28] Forgive us, Lord.
[1:43:33] You see, he wants them to understand
[1:43:35] there is a depth of love that the
[1:43:38] average believer would never enter into.
[1:43:42] to know the love of Christ which passes
[1:43:45] knowledge which is nosis. Science
[1:43:50] knowledge signifies in general
[1:43:52] intelligence
[1:43:53] understanding the general knowledge of
[1:43:56] Christian religion
[1:43:59] that you might be filled with the
[1:44:01] fullness of God. So the real love he
[1:44:03] wants them to comprehend is beyond
[1:44:06] science.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. beyond what you can understand and
[1:44:11] figure out.
[1:44:13] Let me close. That you might be filled
[1:44:16] with the fullness that which has been
[1:44:18] filled. A ship in so much as it is
[1:44:22] filled manned with sailors, roarers,
[1:44:28] soldiers. in the New Testament, a body
[1:44:30] of believers as that which is filled
[1:44:32] with presence, power, agency, riches of
[1:44:38] God and of Christ.
[1:44:40] That which fills or with which a thing
[1:44:43] is filled of those things which a ship
[1:44:46] is filled, freight and merchandise,
[1:44:50] sailors, orsmen,
[1:44:53] soldiers.
[1:44:56] That's why there's not just one fold of
[1:44:58] ministry that ministers to the bride.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Some people want their pastor only.
[1:45:06] You're not fully loaded up yet.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Some people only want the prophet.
[1:45:09] That's all I want to hear. They're not
[1:45:11] fully loaded up yet either.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; So, it takes sailors. It takes orsmen as
[1:45:17] it does in the body of God. And God
[1:45:19] said, "This is what I'm doing." Don't
[1:45:20] you understand? When he does it that
[1:45:22] way, when he does it that way, he'll
[1:45:24] take this certain man say, "Wow, man. I
[1:45:26] read that same scripture the other day.
[1:45:28] Where in the world did he get that at?"
[1:45:30] Viegated wisdom of God. I hear brother
[1:45:33] Tim preach sometimes, brother Ron
[1:45:35] Spencer, you know, brother brother
[1:45:37] Nathan Ericson and brother Wayne and oh
[1:45:40] my, some of these brothers that preach,
[1:45:42] I think, man alive, it's time for me to
[1:45:44] hang up my license and quit. You know,
[1:45:45] if I had license, it's time for me to
[1:45:47] quit. Where in the world did they get
[1:45:49] that at? From the variegated wisdom of
[1:45:51] God as it come from one avenue to
[1:45:54] another to another.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; And the wonderful thing about it is it
[1:45:58] ain't just limited to preachers.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Sisters also tap into the variegated
[1:46:03] wisdom of God. And the way God would
[1:46:06] reach down and save a sister and someone
[1:46:08] would look at and say, "She'll never
[1:46:10] amount to nothing." But yet God turns
[1:46:12] that woman into a great daughter of God
[1:46:15] which displays an excellency of his
[1:46:17] grace that a preacher couldn't even
[1:46:20] touch.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[1:46:29] Praise be to God.
[1:46:35] Oh, praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:46:40] Thank you father.
[1:46:43] Thank you father.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:55] So, I want to ask you tonight,
[1:46:59] instead of pulling out your phone
[1:47:02] and spending so much time on Tik Tok and
[1:47:05] Netflix and Amazon
[1:47:09] and uh social media, all them things. I
[1:47:11] don't have any of them things. So,
[1:47:12] whatever they are, whatever you call
[1:47:13] them,
[1:47:16] I wonder if we wouldn't be better off to
[1:47:18] spend more time
[1:47:20] opening up the lid of our dowy box.
[1:47:24] and finding out the promises of ours.
[1:47:26] So, does Tik Tok has Tik Tok made any of
[1:47:29] y'all more spiritual?
[1:47:33] Anybody get the Holy Ghost by tick-
[1:47:35] tocking?
[1:47:37] What about healed?
[1:47:40] Devils cast out.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; I imagine folks have picked up some
[1:47:44] devils off some of that stuff.
[1:47:46] Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; If the Lord Jesus
[1:47:54] felt like that Facebook,
[1:47:56] Tik Tok, Instagram, on and on and on and
[1:48:01] on and on
[1:48:02] would make us better people.
[1:48:06] Don't you think he would not have waited
[1:48:07] for 2,000 years before giving it?
[1:48:11] On the day of Pentecost, they would have
[1:48:14] tick- tockked each other
[1:48:16] and they would have Instagrammed each
[1:48:18] other
[1:48:20] and Paul would have had the dream about
[1:48:23] the Macedonian call and it would have
[1:48:25] simply been an email or a Tik Tok.
[1:48:30] But instead, it was a Macedonian that
[1:48:32] said, "Come over here.
[1:48:35] We need help."
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; They didn't need Facebook. They didn't
[1:48:39] need some message of this and that. They
[1:48:41] needed a man that could carry the seed.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, we believe in using those means.
[1:48:48] Yes, we believe in using those means.
[1:48:50] But remember,
[1:48:52] life does not pass through an email
[1:48:54] message.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Life can only come through the body,
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; a person that has life. And remember the
[1:49:04] prophet says, and I know it chokes
[1:49:05] people to death, but the greater works
[1:49:07] that Jesus said is imparting
[1:49:11] eternal life.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:49:18] How many wants to be more what the Lord
[1:49:21] Jesus wants of your life? young people,
[1:49:26] teenagers, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s
[1:49:30] like us, and 70s like some of the rest
[1:49:31] of you, and 80s like some of the rest of
[1:49:33] you.
[1:49:35] Oh my, don't we want to give him more of
[1:49:37] of who we are?
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Let the variegated wisdom of God
[1:49:44] express himself through us.
[1:49:48] It may never be great. It may never be
[1:49:51] what somebody else. You don't want to be
[1:49:53] that. You want to simply be what Jesus
[1:49:56] wants you to be.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; What he thought of you is his perfect
[1:50:02] thought. It doesn't need a thing added
[1:50:04] to it or took away.
[1:50:08] As we bow our heads together, I wonder,
[1:50:11] is there anyone here tonight besides me
[1:50:15] that would like to be remembered in
[1:50:17] prayer that God would help you
[1:50:21] to feed more on what's yours as a child
[1:50:24] of God? Look, friends, those of you
[1:50:26] businessmen and business people, sure
[1:50:28] you have to operate your business. Sure
[1:50:30] you do. But it's sin. It is absolutely
[1:50:34] sin. When you sleep, your business, you
[1:50:36] eat your business, you drink your
[1:50:38] business, you're in church, you're still
[1:50:39] doing business, it is sin.
[1:50:42] Whatever you put before God is sin. And
[1:50:47] the prophet said, "Whatever you put
[1:50:48] before God is an idol. If it's your
[1:50:52] wife, if it's your mother, if it's your
[1:50:54] car, if it's your work, if it's your
[1:50:56] job."
[1:50:59] Remember a message that the Lord gave me
[1:51:01] to preach to you years and years ago at
[1:51:02] the old church on the bondage of time.
[1:51:08] Boy, if it was bondage all them years
[1:51:10] ago, how much more is it today?
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; And we ain't got more time than what we
[1:51:17] had then. We got the same amount of time
[1:51:18] 24 hours in a day, but we got all these
[1:51:20] other things that's wanting our time.
[1:51:23] We need help, don't we, from the Lord to
[1:51:25] balance it all
[1:51:28] with our heads bowed.
[1:51:31] How many just by uplifting your hand,
[1:51:33] Lord, be mindful of me tonight. Father,
[1:51:36] forgive me, Lord, for wasting my time.
[1:51:39] Forgive me, Lord, for complaining
[1:51:41] hearing this tonight made me realize
[1:51:43] what Paul went through, what them saints
[1:51:45] went through.
[1:51:47] Oh Lord Jesus, I got both of mine up
[1:51:50] tonight. Father, help me. Lord, help me.
[1:51:55] Oh Jesus, as we
[1:51:58] as we ask you tonight, now we've heard
[1:52:01] these things and as James said, be you
[1:52:03] not forgetful hearers. That a person
[1:52:07] would walk into the place and see
[1:52:09] themsel in a mirror and then turn and
[1:52:12] walk away and forget what manner of
[1:52:14] person that they were.
[1:52:17] A lot of the people around the message
[1:52:18] are so educated now in the message.
[1:52:21] When I go to talk to them and counsel
[1:52:23] them, they tell me everything that they
[1:52:26] need to do. They tell me everything they
[1:52:29] need to stop and everything they need to
[1:52:31] start and every attitude they need to
[1:52:34] get rid of and the attitude they need to
[1:52:36] have. And boy, they can sit there and
[1:52:37] tell me all the right things
[1:52:40] and get up and walk out and don't do any
[1:52:43] of them.
[1:52:47] Lord, for many people, they're in a
[1:52:49] dangerous position
[1:52:51] because we've sat around this word for
[1:52:53] years and years and years.
[1:52:56] And as I hear from people all the time,
[1:52:59] Baptist preachers that stream our
[1:53:00] services, Pentecostals that stream our
[1:53:02] services because they're running out of
[1:53:04] things to preach.
[1:53:07] And I hear from them that you guys have
[1:53:10] more word in one service than we have in
[1:53:13] six months in our church.
[1:53:17] And as the prophet said, Lord, we're fat
[1:53:20] and sassy.
[1:53:23] So if a preacher misques a quote and
[1:53:25] leaves out an and or a the or a for,
[1:53:27] boy, we take a note of it and we're
[1:53:29] going to let him know it. And what good
[1:53:32] does it do if it don't manifest itself
[1:53:34] out of us and alive, Lord?
[1:53:38] But we thank you, Father.
[1:53:40] It will
[1:53:42] because we are part of your variegated
[1:53:46] wisdom on display,
[1:53:50] Lord. And even as Peter talked about
[1:53:52] that the angels
[1:53:55] that the angels look into when he talked
[1:53:59] about the Holy Ghost which things the
[1:54:02] angels look into and the word means to
[1:54:05] stoop down and peer and concentrate
[1:54:09] deeply.
[1:54:12] So the angels see your mercy to us
[1:54:16] and they see our failures and how we
[1:54:19] treat you
[1:54:21] and they see your mercies are endless
[1:54:25] and they see how we do you
[1:54:28] and they peer and look into it
[1:54:32] cuz they just don't understand it.
[1:54:35] how you would deal with us. and service
[1:54:38] after service, day after day, week after
[1:54:40] week, year after year,
[1:54:43] and they're trying to comprehend
[1:54:46] the wisdom, the love, the mercy of God
[1:54:52] cuz they can recall
[1:54:54] way back when when Satan preached his
[1:54:58] sermon in heaven and caused that split
[1:55:02] because he got tired of being the
[1:55:04] associate pastor in heaven. So he wanted
[1:55:07] his own church as we would say
[1:55:10] and he preached a sermon and
[1:55:13] those angels fell.
[1:55:16] Those angels remember what you did to
[1:55:18] those beings.
[1:55:21] You put them in chains of darkness.
[1:55:25] And yet they see your sons and your
[1:55:27] daughters week after week, day after
[1:55:29] day. They're so needy and they fall and
[1:55:33] they fail and they they they cry out for
[1:55:36] deliverance and and they mean it, Lord.
[1:55:39] And they see you out of your abundant
[1:55:41] mercy and forgiveness. Come running to
[1:55:43] them. Come running to them, Lord.
[1:55:49] And the angels look at it and they
[1:55:51] ponder
[1:55:53] and they wonder.
[1:55:56] Not only that, but father whenever we
[1:55:58] are gathered there. Hallelujah.
[1:56:02] The prophet tells us the angels of God
[1:56:04] will circle the earth with bowed heads
[1:56:09] as we bow our heads and lift our voices
[1:56:11] and sing amazing grace.
[1:56:15] How sweet the sound.
[1:56:17] And the angels of God
[1:56:20] by the multitudes
[1:56:22] which have never sinned, never said a
[1:56:25] bad word, never had a bad thought in
[1:56:27] their mind,
[1:56:29] their praises will be silenced
[1:56:32] by the redeemed bride.
[1:56:36] Hallelujah.
[1:56:39] No doubt it'll be somewhere about that
[1:56:41] time frame
[1:56:43] it'll start clicking to them.
[1:56:47] They will see the excitement that you
[1:56:49] have on the day of the rapture. The
[1:56:52] moment you arise from the mediatorial
[1:56:55] seat and you change your garments as it
[1:56:58] were,
[1:57:00] they will see your countenance as it
[1:57:02] changes.
[1:57:05] They will then see the theophanes
[1:57:07] released out from under your altar from
[1:57:11] the sixth dimension.
[1:57:13] Oh, glory to God.
[1:57:16] and they will know the hour has arrived.
[1:57:20] For they are now even since 1965,
[1:57:25] for 60 years in the way we measure time,
[1:57:30] they have been standing there
[1:57:31] breathlessly
[1:57:34] awaiting our arrival.
[1:57:37] Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] Oh Jesus,
[1:57:43] we worship you tonight. My God.
[1:57:48] Thank you, Father.
[1:57:50] We don't want to take advantage or abuse
[1:57:53] grace, Lord. Never.
[1:57:56] Oh, Lord. We thank you for it.
[1:58:00] Hallelujah.
[1:58:02] We worship you tonight, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:07] We bless your holy name, Father.
[1:58:12] Oh, can we just love him a little bit
[1:58:14] now, saints?
[1:58:17] Just pull him, as it were, up close to
[1:58:19] you.
[1:58:21] Do something for him that the angels
[1:58:23] cannot do.
[1:58:26] Pull him over on your lap.
[1:58:29] Dear beloved,
[1:58:32] let him look into your eyes and
[1:58:35] let him describe you with his adjectives
[1:58:39] of love.
[1:58:41] I knew you before the world began.
[1:58:46] I don't think of you, my child,
[1:58:49] as a failed creature of humanity.
[1:58:54] But you are my bride.
[1:58:58] Before there was time, I loved you.
[1:59:03] Before there were angels,
[1:59:05] I wanted to give you myself.
[1:59:09] Before the horizontal rainbow come into
[1:59:12] existence
[1:59:14] and the horizon broke forth,
[1:59:18] you were in my heart purpose.
[1:59:21] I needed you to give me purpose,
[1:59:26] reason and purpose.
[1:59:31] I will never leave you, my love.
[1:59:35] I went to Calvary for you.
[1:59:38] I went to the regions of the lost for
[1:59:41] you
[1:59:43] and I raised with you and me that day.
[1:59:49] And I tell you, I'm coming soon.
[1:59:53] My beloved,
[1:59:55] my undefiled,
[1:59:58] the darling of my heart.
[2:00:01] I tell you, be encouraged.
[2:00:06] For it is you that I dream of.
[2:00:10] I will sing over you.
[2:00:14] Hallelujah.
[2:00:16] Hallelujah.
[2:00:19] We worship you, Lord God.
[2:00:23] We magnify your name tonight, Lord
[2:00:26] Jesus.
[2:00:30] Let's just love him, children.
[2:00:33] Oh my.
[2:00:35] Let's just open our hearts to him.
[2:00:38] I trust you have a a secret place in you
[2:00:43] that's reserved for the Lord Jesus only.
[2:00:49] Because I can tell you he has one in him
[2:00:53] that is reserved for his bride only. He
[2:00:56] loves the church. Oh yes. And he even
[2:00:58] loves the world too.
[2:01:00] But he has a secret place in his being
[2:01:05] which is reserved for his elected.
[2:01:09] They were in that secret place
[2:01:14] before the celestial beings
[2:01:17] come into existence.
[2:01:20] Hallelujah.
[2:01:23] Oh Jesus, we worship you tonight,
[2:01:26] Father.
[2:01:29] We bless your name, Lord.
[2:01:32] We lift our hands, Father, in your
[2:01:34] presence. And
[2:01:37] we say we love you. We adore you.
[2:01:41] We magnify you.
[2:01:44] Rose of Sharon,
[2:01:46] lily of the valley,
[2:01:48] bright and morning star,
[2:01:53] the great Adonai,
[2:01:57] Yahweh Elohim.
[2:02:01] Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] The I am
[2:02:06] that I am.
[2:02:08] Hallelujah, Jesus.
[2:02:13] Praise be to God.
[2:02:16] We worship you, Lord.
[2:02:20] Father, may each of us enter into this
[2:02:23] holy sanctum right now.
[2:02:27] It's not a feeling
[2:02:29] per se,
[2:02:31] but it's a presence.
[2:02:34] I hope, Lord, my church
[2:02:36] that you've sent me to lead.
[2:02:39] I hope before I leave this world, before
[2:02:41] I'm called out of my work or whatever it
[2:02:43] will be, I hope I can bring them to an
[2:02:46] understanding to know that there is a
[2:02:49] difference in feeling you and being in a
[2:02:54] presence which nearly takes our breaths
[2:02:57] away.
[2:02:59] And yet many times when we're in that
[2:03:01] presence,
[2:03:02] our flesh will feel absolutely nothing.
[2:03:06] But our being is so caught into another
[2:03:08] sphere
[2:03:10] that it's hard to describe how we'll
[2:03:12] feel it.
[2:03:14] But it's a lifechanging something.
[2:03:18] Oh, I love you, Jesus.
[2:03:23] I worship you.
[2:03:27] I praise you my king.
[2:03:30] Hallelujah.
[2:03:34] Hallelujah Jesus.
[2:03:38] Hallelujah Jesus.
[2:03:47] Got something on your heart.
[2:03:51] Hallelujah. Jesus.
[2:03:55] I know what it's like.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:04:01] because my life
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; to be in the presence of the
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; I bless your name.
[2:04:09] I worship you my God.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; And I know what time it is.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Help me tonight, Jesus.
[2:04:18] Move on every heart.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; This time stood
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; while we're in your presence. Change us,
[2:04:24] Lord.
[2:04:26] Take those commitments that we've made.
[2:04:30] would not have the strength to follow
[2:04:32] through.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; May we leave this place tonight with a
[2:04:35] renewed strength of
[2:04:39] restored.

[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Abraham's breasted God.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] Lord,
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hagar's well,
[2:05:00] the well of him that sees.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; No one had to say,
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; "Oh Jesus, see every need we have no.
[2:05:07] May you pass through this place, heal
[2:05:10] the sick, Father,
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; may evil spirits
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; lose their hold on your children, Father
[2:05:18] God. May the Holy Ghost
[2:05:21] give up everything.
[2:05:24] Oh Jesus, we praise you father for this
[2:05:28] treasure.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Jesus.

[2:17:12] me there.

[2:17:41] But I said,
[2:17:45] "I want to
[2:17:48] see my Jesus,
[2:17:54] for he's the one
[2:17:58] who died
[2:18:01] for us all." Let's sing it, church.
[2:18:05] Oh, I bow on
[2:18:10] my knees and oh hallelujah. Honest
[2:18:14] worshiping children.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; He deserves it. He's worthy of it.
[2:18:22] Oh, let the bride sing it now. We cry
[2:18:26] glory.
[2:18:31] I clap
[2:18:34] my hands.
[2:18:37] I say glory.
[2:18:41] Thank God. Oh, I sing glory
[2:18:46] to to the sun.
[2:18:50] Oh, everybody once again bow on my
[2:18:52] knees. Oh,
[2:18:55] I bow on
[2:18:59] my knees and cried holy.
[2:19:05] Let the bride singing.
[2:19:07] Oh, we say holy,
[2:19:12] holy,
[2:19:13] we cry holy
[2:19:20] our
[2:19:23] hands and s
[2:19:26] glory.
[2:19:31] We all sang gloryy
[2:19:35] to the son
[2:19:38] of God.
[2:19:41] [Music]
[2:19:45] Praise be to God.
[2:19:50] Hallelujah.
[2:19:53] We love you Lord God.
[2:19:56] We love you Lord God. We worship you
[2:19:58] tonight Jesus.
[2:20:01] Meetings like this, Lord, will suffice
[2:20:06] until we get to see you that day.
[2:20:10] These encourage us, they change us, they
[2:20:13] alter us, they modify us, Lord, and for
[2:20:17] that we're thankful.
[2:20:20] You give us just enough sometimes, and
[2:20:22] it makes us so hungry for more.
[2:20:25] But you know how to do that.
[2:20:28] Truly, your prophet told us this life
[2:20:30] was not intended to be easy.
[2:20:35] I think we can all say amen to that. No
[2:20:38] matter how much we get, what we do,
[2:20:41] and yet we know in the world when we
[2:20:43] ought to be so satisfied with this and
[2:20:45] that and the other, but there's a
[2:20:47] longing a craving something in us, Lord.
[2:20:51] And it's something this world cannot
[2:20:53] give us. It's you.
[2:20:56] Help us, Lord.
[2:20:57] As we leave this place tonight, may the
[2:20:59] spirit of God go with your children,
[2:21:01] Lord. Keep us safely. Bring us back
[2:21:04] Sunday if it'd be pleasing to you.
[2:21:06] Father,
[2:21:08] we worship you, Lord God, with all of
[2:21:11] our hearts.
[2:21:13] Amen. We worship you, Jesus.
[2:21:16] All right, let's sing together. How
[2:21:19] Great Thou Art. Can we just sing this
[2:21:21] before we go? Can you say, "It's been
[2:21:24] good to be in the house of the Lord
[2:21:25] tonight.
[2:21:27] Amen.
[2:21:29] Oh Lord
[2:21:32] my God,
[2:21:34] [Music]
[2:21:36] when I in awe
[2:21:41] some wonder
[2:21:46] consider
[2:21:49] all
[2:21:52] the world
[2:21:54] thine hands
[2:21:56] have
[2:21:58] [Music]
[2:22:01] I see
[2:22:04] the stars.
[2:22:08] I hear the rolling
[2:22:12] thunder.
[2:22:17] I power
[2:22:20] throughout
[2:22:24] the universe
[2:22:26] [Music]
[2:22:28] display.
[2:22:33] I've seen rainbows all my life
[2:22:37] coming from Kentucky. Week before last
[2:22:39] on Sunday evening, Carol and I come up
[2:22:42] Interstate 81.
[2:22:44] We're going to take exit 57. which is
[2:22:47] 26. Coming to Johnson City, we see a
[2:22:51] rainbow in front of us.
[2:22:53] Little did either of us know that we
[2:22:57] were going to pass through that rainbow.
[2:23:01] So, we exit off on exit 57. And as we
[2:23:05] come up to make the tur the curve right
[2:23:07] around before you get to Eastern Star,
[2:23:09] you know what I'm talking about. You've
[2:23:10] come through there many times. The end
[2:23:13] of that rainbow was right on that exit,
[2:23:17] right in the ditch and right where our
[2:23:20] car was. And we passed right through
[2:23:24] those colors. And those colors hit our
[2:23:27] car and it was hitting us and hitting
[2:23:31] the road. And we just come through it
[2:23:34] just
[2:23:36] and we looked at one another and I said,
[2:23:38] "What just happened?
[2:23:42] Can you imagine what it's going to be
[2:23:43] one of these days? Now remember, none of
[2:23:46] you, none of you, some of you seen the
[2:23:48] double rainbow this week. Different
[2:23:49] people pass the picture around of a
[2:23:51] double rainbow. Beautiful. But you've
[2:23:54] only seen half of one.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; But one of these days when we get up to
[2:23:58] his throne, we'll finally see the other
[2:24:02] half. Thank you, Lord.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz the rainbow will be around
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; his throne. The picture has come back
[2:24:12] full
[2:24:14] circle.
[2:24:17] So the artwork, it will take the artwork
[2:24:20] being gathered together around the
[2:24:23] throne before he gets the other half
[2:24:27] of the rainbow.
[2:24:31] Then sings my soul,
[2:24:37] my savior
[2:24:40] God.
[2:24:43] God bless you, saints. I love you, my
[2:24:45] goodness.
