[7:44] service this morning
[7:47] or ever
[7:51] I'd ask Brother Louie if I could have
[7:53] about five minutes
[7:55] before service to make a couple
[7:57] announcements about the upcoming
[7:59] services this coming weekend
[8:03] we would like to ask
[8:06] any and everyone to carpool if possible
[8:11] I know that there's families that bring
[8:14] two or three vehicles to a service
[8:17] if we could alleviate that to some
[8:19] extent it would be a great help in our
[8:22] parking
[8:23] I know it's not always possible to do
[8:27] that but maybe if you could just
[8:29] evaluate your own situation and see if
[8:31] you could possibly could you know the
[8:34] carpool for these weekend Services it
[8:36] would really help us out a lot
[8:39] and also we've obtained some additional
[8:41] parking
[8:43] for the services it's adjacent to to our
[8:47] property
[8:48] it's in the back of the church here it's
[8:50] The Old Barn restaurant area I'm sure
[8:53] most of you are familiar with the Old
[8:55] Barn restaurant that's no longer in
[8:58] business if you come past our entrance
[9:01] past our property it's the second
[9:03] driveway on the left
[9:05] we'll have signs down there to direct
[9:08] you into the parking we'll have several
[9:11] of our security guys down there doing
[9:13] the parking
[9:14] I promise you we won't block you in we
[9:17] will park you to where you can get out
[9:19] easy at any time you need to get out
[9:22] it's easy access back to the church we
[9:26] have established a gate
[9:28] that connects the two properties
[9:31] and you can actually walk back once you
[9:34] park in that area you can walk back
[9:37] through the gate to the parking lot here
[9:39] we'll have a golf cart that will bring
[9:43] you back let you off at the handicap
[9:45] entrance here at the side of the
[9:46] building
[9:47] we have two Vans to shuttle you back to
[9:50] show you right to the front door
[9:53] show you from the front door back to
[9:55] your vehicle
[9:57] and if anyone would like to help us out
[10:00] with parking in that area you could
[10:03] bring your passengers to the front here
[10:06] set them out move back around and go
[10:09] down to the old barn parking area it's
[10:12] strictly volunteer we're just asking as
[10:15] many people as we possibly can to park
[10:18] in that area because we'd love to save a
[10:21] lot of our parking lot around the
[10:22] building here for our handicapped and
[10:26] our elderly and and also our visitors
[10:31] um
[10:34] also
[10:36] for the meetings we're going to open the
[10:38] doors one hour and 45 minutes early
[10:41] brother Dan Robbins will open the doors
[10:44] at 5 15 on Friday and Saturday and 9 15
[10:48] on Sunday
[10:52] um
[10:53] we seating will be first come first
[10:57] serve
[10:58] we would like to fill up this lower
[11:00] sections here first before we open up
[11:02] the mezzanine
[11:04] seating is going to be at a premium I
[11:07] think for these meetings so I'm not sure
[11:09] we'll have the luxury of having a seat
[11:11] or two seats in between us
[11:16] um so help us out help the deacons out
[11:19] when you see a vacant seat or two vacant
[11:21] seats beside you just raise your hand
[11:23] point to it help us out because it's
[11:26] sometimes it's very difficult to to find
[11:29] you know some seeds when there's certain
[11:32] amount of people gets in this area
[11:34] so I know you've helped us out in the
[11:37] past when when we're at Happy Valley and
[11:39] we had a crowd you'd always help us out
[11:41] and we really appreciate that we need it
[11:44] once the sanctuary is filled up
[11:47] we have some seating that's been we've
[11:51] set up in the fellowship hall
[11:53] as an overflow
[11:55] um
[11:57] we will not open that overflow up until
[12:01] we have all the seating that's taken
[12:03] place in here in the sanctuary
[12:07] we don't know what kind of crowd we're
[12:09] going to have
[12:10] so that's the reason we're setting up an
[12:12] overflow over there in case it gets
[12:15] completely full in this area in the
[12:17] sanctuary
[12:20] also um
[12:22] the sisters wanted me to announce that
[12:25] after the services uh Friday night and
[12:28] Saturday night there'll be a snack bag
[12:31] available for everyone over into the
[12:34] fellowship hall
[12:35] so once we dismiss on Friday night once
[12:38] we dismiss on Saturday night if you
[12:40] would just exit the sanctuary go over to
[12:43] the fellowship hall for a snack bag it's
[12:46] for everyone it's not just for visitors
[12:48] but it's for for our home people and and
[12:51] visitors
[12:53] I know that um
[12:55] the parking and and the seating may be a
[12:59] little bit inconvenient but
[13:03] for myself and everyone I've talked to
[13:05] that our expectations are so high for
[13:08] these meetings that I know the
[13:10] expectations will far exceed any type of
[13:13] inconvenience that we might experience
[13:16] so we're really excited for the meetings
[13:18] and and and I know God will bless us
[13:21] immensely thank you brother Louie
[13:31] well there's one thing he needs to know
[13:34] don't never say never
[13:41] that we love our deacons don't we amen

[20:35] Heavenly Father
[20:38] we are
[20:40] indebted to you
[20:42] with a debt that we cannot pay
[20:47] and You Paid a Debt that you didn't know
[20:49] in order that we could have the Liberty
[20:50] that we have this day and
[20:53] we've heard these names and they
[20:55] represent circumstances and situations
[20:57] some were close to some we know
[21:01] by association
[21:03] others may even be family members father
[21:06] some may even be us ourselves
[21:10] but oh God we bring them to you because
[21:12] we know that you are more than able and
[21:15] you teach us to be in that same stature
[21:18] may we position ourselves this day to
[21:21] receive more of your glory
[21:24] may we be intentional about the things
[21:26] that we say may we be purposeful about
[21:29] the things that we do oh God and may we
[21:32] be constrained in our minds in our
[21:34] hearts Lord everything may we keep you

[21:42] in our homes
[21:44] in our circumstances in our situations
[21:47] we have no help but you
[21:52] and even in a in a time where we with
[21:56] science Lord we are seeing the UN
[21:59] unimaginable things being done but yet
[22:02] Lord At The Pinnacle of all of that when
[22:05] something happens in that realm Lord

[22:13] there was nothing that they could do
[22:15] Lord that vessel lost its signal because
[22:18] something happened
[22:20] and Lord maybe someone is here today
[22:22] that they've lost their signal because
[22:25] Something's Happened in their life and
[22:27] they're going down
[22:29] but oh God may you send out that
[22:32] Lifeline maybe it would be a kind word
[22:35] from my lips or from a sister's Voice or
[22:38] maybe it would be the words that they
[22:40] will hear today in this very message
[22:42] maybe it be the words in a song Whatever
[22:45] it would be be done father may it be For
[22:47] Your Glory may it be that Lifeline oh

[27:38] have you and your family with us in
[27:40] service today give him one more good
[27:42] hand as he comes this morning
[27:59] great to be here thank you all so much
[28:04] I guess
[28:12] the piano isn't the only thing I'm
[28:13] struggling with anymore
[28:16] I cannot get it
[28:17] [Music]
[28:24] there we go
[28:25] well thank you if the rest of this Falls
[28:27] flat it'll just be the standard then
[28:30] thank you all so much it's great to be
[28:32] here um
[28:34] we were asked to sing the song and I
[28:37] wrote this after a friend of mine sent
[28:40] me a little YouTube clip of a sermon by
[28:43] a preacher named Aleister Begg and he
[28:47] was talking about the thief on the cross
[28:48] I think we all know the story how he
[28:50] turned to Jesus and said please remember
[28:52] me
[28:53] and Jesus said today you'll be with me
[28:56] in Paradise
[28:58] and the sermon
[29:00] was imagining what it would be like if
[29:02] that man were to be stopped by an Angel
[29:05] and asked
[29:06] why are you here
[29:09] and he'd probably say something like
[29:13] I don't know
[29:16] and as as the angel asked more questions
[29:19] it was very clear quickly that this man
[29:23] had nothing to offer
[29:29] and maybe maybe the angel said something
[29:31] like in frustration well on what basis
[29:34] are you here
[29:36] and the man would have to stay to say
[29:39] all I can tell you
[29:41] is the man on the middle cross
[29:43] said I could come
[29:47] and sometimes we take credit for what
[29:50] God has done in our lives and we say
[29:51] things like I believed and I live a good
[29:54] life
[29:55] but the scripture says that even our
[29:58] righteousness is as is filthy to a holy
[30:01] and just God
[30:05] and the truth is that we have nothing
[30:08] more to offer the Lord than that Thief
[30:11] did
[30:13] and if we answer that question when we
[30:16] stand before our creator
[30:18] and it starts with I
[30:20] we've gone wrong
[30:24] but we only have salvation because he
[30:27] died for our sin
[30:30] he rose from the dead
[30:32] and he said I could come
[30:35] please
[30:38] [Music]
[30:47] he was one of three
[30:51] to be crucified
[30:55] but unlike the king
[30:58] he deserved to die
[31:01] an evil life had brought him to this
[31:06] fate
[31:09] and the price for all he done
[31:13] was more than he could pay
[31:16] but then he turned to Jesus and that day
[31:23] he found himself at
[31:27] Paradise his gate
[31:31] and when they asked the reason he
[31:35] belonged on golden streets
[31:38] he said all I know is when Jesus looked
[31:44] at me he said I could come not because
[31:51] of anything I've done there's no doubt I
[31:57] don't deserve this love
[32:00] so if there is a reason there there's
[32:05] just one
[32:08] and I met God's son
[32:11] he said I could come
[32:20] and with an empty hand
[32:24] no good deed to bring
[32:28] one day I will stand
[32:31] before the King of Kings
[32:35] the only goodness I will have
[32:40] play
[32:42] is the goodness of the Lord
[32:46] Who Loved away my shame
[32:50] so if I'm asked the reason I am saved
[32:56] just like that thief and
[33:00] Paradise his gate
[33:04] I'll Stand secure because I'm standing
[33:08] on his sacrifice
[33:12] and all I'll have to say is when Jesus
[33:17] changed my life he said I
[33:22] come
[33:23] come not because of anything I've done
[33:29] there's no doubt I don't deserve this
[33:33] love
[33:34] so if there is a reason
[33:38] there's just one
[33:42] and I'm that God's son he said I could
[33:47] come
[33:55] when I see my life
[33:58] there is no hope for me but my hope
[34:03] Comes Alive When I Look to Calvary
[34:10] cause he said I could come not because
[34:16] of anything I've done there's no doubt I
[34:23] don't deserve this love
[34:26] so if there is a reason
[34:29] there's just one
[34:33] when I met God
[34:47] said
[34:48] I could care
[34:54] he said I could try
[35:04] mom said that's why

[38:51] I did not fully trust Ed
[38:59] how he longed for me to understand
[39:08] that I could
[39:12] [Music]
[39:15] so through the valley
[39:20] he led me
[39:24] afraid as I could be till I felt his
[39:32] loving
[39:33] [Music]
[39:35] worms
[39:38] embracing me

[39:45] how could I ever
[39:49] doubt a god whose hands hold the you
[39:56] never
[39:57] [Music]
[40:00] why would I ever
[40:04] question
[40:06] his ability
[40:12] [Music]
[40:14] there's no place that I can go where he
[40:21] doesn't know the things
[40:30] always
[40:32] aware of
[40:35] where I am
[40:37] and what I need
[40:45] and I've been through enough
[40:49] to know him
[40:54] for me
[41:00] and he's come through too many times
[41:05] that puts my mind
[41:14] [Music]
[41:18] foreign
[41:22] [Music]
[41:50] [Music]
[42:03] seen him work before

[43:14] to know he'll be enough
[43:19] for me
[43:22] [Music]
[43:25] and he's come through too many times
[43:34] [Music]
[43:45] he's gonna take care of
[43:49] me
[43:51] [Music]
[43:53] cause I've been through enough

[44:31] [Applause]
[44:39] Jesus
[44:40] thank you Father
[44:44] let me knows that's the truth
[44:51] sometimes you look at it you think
[44:53] I'm not sure
[44:55] not sure if it's going to work I'm not
[44:58] sure what's going to happen
[45:00] not sure what the results is going to be
[45:03] but you know God's faithful
[45:06] that's where you realize that a person
[45:08] that first gets saved they don't trust
[45:11] God that way
[45:13] that's actually not a gift something
[45:15] that God gives you comes by experience
[45:18] you learn that you can trust him no
[45:21] matter what's going on what's around you
[45:24] how bad and Bleak and indifferent it may
[45:26] be
[45:27] but you know I've been through enough
[45:30] to know he's all that I need
[45:34] and they're privilege for us to be
[45:36] together again today
[45:38] so so happy and so looking forward to
[45:42] the meetings coming up this week Lord
[45:44] willing and I know you've been praying
[45:46] let's just continue to pray that the
[45:48] Lord will just meet with us in a in a
[45:50] great way
[45:52] um
[45:53] probably going to be a big crowd for us
[45:55] to deal with and we'll
[45:56] do our best to deal with that but
[46:00] I want to say also that
[46:03] we're looking for the Lord to do great
[46:05] things not just in healings and things
[46:07] like that but salvation restoration of
[46:10] backsliders people getting the Holy
[46:11] Ghost so
[46:13] somebody on your heart invite them
[46:16] your children that's away from the Lord
[46:18] and by them to come
[46:20] somebody asked me about local churches
[46:23] calling us absolutely let them come
[46:26] come we'll Fellowship we'll do what we
[46:29] can together to help one another you've
[46:32] got somebody on your heart
[46:33] brother Donnie but just all the
[46:35] self-righteous people
[46:37] no
[46:38] about all the saints I'm afraid that
[46:40] stand down our crowd big
[46:44] all the sinless ones well you won't
[46:46] knock me out too
[46:48] remember the Joel couldn't even come if
[46:50] you do that
[46:54] I'll tell you who we invite
[46:56] thieves
[47:00] Liars
[47:03] we'll bolt down the stuff till the
[47:05] thieves get saved
[47:09] what do we think Church is
[47:12] for the perfect
[47:13] for those who need no help no friends
[47:17] no
[47:19] we want this to be
[47:21] a first church of Mercy
[47:24] First Church of Mercy
[47:26] to where that those that seem so ill
[47:29] repute
[47:30] and remember
[47:32] we ever get to a place to where that we
[47:34] cannot reach out to a person like that
[47:36] we're not anywhere close to Jesus
[47:41] I read this week where the Prophet said
[47:43] that the people that was around him were
[47:45] stinking fishermen
[47:48] low down
[47:49] people that a lot of us wouldn't even
[47:51] look at
[47:52] imagine the woman that had been married
[47:54] all them husbands
[47:56] we would have took the legalism of the
[47:59] scripture and whatever more and proved
[48:01] they went a bit more Hope from that
[48:04] woman than there was the Devil Himself
[48:07] but Jesus wrote a message of Mercy on
[48:09] the sand
[48:11] amen I want to be like him that way too
[48:13] don't you
[48:16] so let's pray and we'll just ask the
[48:18] Lord to move for us and we just
[48:20] expecting God for a wonderful time and
[48:23] let's turn today if you would to Psalm
[48:25] again Psalm 37 3.
[48:31] Lord Willem will be having a prayer line
[48:33] on Saturday night
[48:35] brother Tim pro to be opening the
[48:38] service speaking for us on Friday and
[48:40] then brother Ron Spencer on
[48:43] Saturday and plan on a prayer line I
[48:46] told him if you didn't feel up to it of
[48:47] course be no obligation on that we would
[48:50] do it if we needed to if he wants to
[48:51] stay as long as he can he can do that
[48:54] whatever's comfortable for him and then
[48:56] David Siler will be finishing up for us
[48:59] on Sunday morning so we're just coming
[49:02] expecting a great time well Daryl told
[49:04] me a couple of years ago up in Virginia
[49:06] brother Sean Martins it was about 900 to
[49:09] a thousand people something like there
[49:10] there at that meeting and the prayer
[49:13] line went on to 1 30 in the morning
[49:16] so needless to say if he had that many
[49:19] people in the prayer line you won't have
[49:21] to stay that long if you don't feel that
[49:22] you can do it you can be able to slip
[49:25] out and have some food over there in the
[49:27] fellowship hall for you you can get that
[49:29] and you go but just we come expecting
[49:33] the Lord to do great things with all of
[49:36] our hearts
[49:37] but I have to be honest I'm not just
[49:39] waiting till Friday
[49:41] I'm expecting him today
[49:44] I need him today anybody else need him
[49:48] I need him right now
[49:51] I need him like I've never needed him
[49:55] trust in the Lord and do good
[49:58] so shalt thou dwell in the land and
[50:01] verily shalt thou be fed
[50:03] Delight thyself also in the Lord listen
[50:06] this promise now
[50:08] and he shall give thee
[50:10] the desires
[50:12] of thine heart
[50:14] Romans 8 16.
[50:17] the spirit itself Bears witness with our
[50:20] spirit that we are the children of God
[50:23] and if children then heirs Heirs of God
[50:26] John heiress with Christ
[50:29] if so be that we suffer with him
[50:32] we may also be glorified
[50:34] together
[50:36] I spoken to you last Sunday but let me
[50:38] just remind you today you are heirs
[50:41] of God
[50:43] that's what you receive
[50:45] second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 10
[50:49] Paul speaking of the contrast between
[50:53] life how it can be sometimes
[50:56] as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[51:01] as poor yet making many rich
[51:06] as having nothing
[51:09] and yet possessing
[51:12] all things
[51:14] as having nothing and yet possessing
[51:18] all things and he has a request on your
[51:21] heart today you'd like to be remembered
[51:22] before the Lord Erica got to come home
[51:24] on Thursday thank the Lord the last
[51:26] couple of days she's been really really
[51:28] weak so if y'all would just join with us
[51:32] in prayer for that today
[51:35] Heavenly Father we thank you so much for
[51:37] your mercy to us
[51:39] thank you dear God
[51:42] as the two songs we heard today
[51:46] Lord the first one it will not be
[51:48] anything that we could ever do
[51:51] that would privilege us to walk down
[51:53] those streets of gold
[51:56] but because you said we could come
[51:59] That's How we'll get there Lord we're so
[52:02] grateful
[52:03] then father we've been through enough
[52:07] to know you'll be enough
[52:09] to help us
[52:11] the Lord Jesus we're looking to you
[52:13] today now
[52:14] that you take your word and speak to us
[52:17] once again you know our needs there's so
[52:20] many
[52:23] father the hundreds of people that are
[52:25] here and the thousands that will go back
[52:27] and hear this service
[52:30] help us
[52:31] we need you today Lord we need your
[52:34] strength we need your healing we need
[52:36] your
[52:37] your great encouragement we need all the
[52:41] things that our souls thirst for today
[52:43] can only be satisfied by you
[52:46] take your word speak to us with your
[52:49] father
[52:50] in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask you
[52:53] and the Saints said amen amen God bless
[52:56] you you may be seated
[53:06] how innumerable
[53:08] are the blessings of God to his people
[53:11] we've been speaking about the bride's
[53:14] Bill of Rights
[53:16] a few more that we'd like to look at
[53:18] today by the help of the Lord
[53:20] one of them is the right to reign
[53:24] the right to reign r-e-i-g-n
[53:29] reign
[53:31] reigning is something that most people
[53:35] in this life
[53:37] can never do correctly
[53:39] some start out maybe in a kingdom and a
[53:43] position a magistrate a prime minister a
[53:46] president a person of authority
[53:49] a person of renown as we would say no
[53:53] doubt many of them have started out
[53:54] great
[53:56] had good intentions of serving the
[53:59] people in their Kingdom or their
[54:02] constituency wherever they are
[54:05] and then they go to seeing opportunities
[54:07] that are only available for the upper
[54:11] echelon by ways that they can cheat and
[54:14] get by with it and do wrong and feel
[54:17] like that they're free from penalty or
[54:20] prosecution like the rest of us are and
[54:24] like so many even police officers we
[54:27] hear about it and state troopers and
[54:29] judges and many people like that and
[54:33] before long the vision of what they
[54:36] initially set out to be changes and they
[54:40] find themselves a total different person
[54:42] I've always thought it must have been
[54:44] must be really unusual
[54:47] for a judge whether he's a Circuit Judge
[54:49] or whatever type of Judge that he is and
[54:52] he has people come before him all the
[54:54] time
[54:55] and he will give to them the law
[54:59] and yet you hear of different ones of
[55:01] those judges that are worse than the
[55:05] people that they sentence and you think
[55:08] did they get to a place to where they
[55:10] just lose the sense of right and wrong
[55:13] they don't even care about it anymore
[55:15] and yet they would send you to jail to
[55:19] prison they would say a certain fine of
[55:21] x amount of dollars and they themselves
[55:24] live worse than you do
[55:26] and it must be something that
[55:29] transitions in a lot of people that they
[55:32] change with authority and power and they
[55:36] get to a spot to where is that morality
[55:39] Justice and character and truth it no
[55:42] longer has any value but what is the
[55:45] highest value to them is what they can
[55:47] do what they can get by with the amount
[55:50] of money they can make and want they're
[55:52] able to pull over and be able to get by
[55:55] with but we know people like that aren't
[55:59] really fit to Reign if we would be able
[56:02] to look at the end of a president's term
[56:05] and see what he was going to do to our
[56:07] nation he would never become president
[56:10] because most people would look at that
[56:13] and say man I don't want that guy doing
[56:15] this to our country I don't want that
[56:17] guy doing this and tank turns it into
[56:19] that turning this upside down there's no
[56:22] way we would want that but we really
[56:24] don't know do we but God has the ability
[56:27] by foreknowledge to be able to look
[56:30] ahead in time before there was any time
[56:34] and be able to look ahead and see what
[56:38] people would do he knew what David would
[56:41] do and what Solomon would do he knew
[56:44] what Ahab would do he knew what a lot of
[56:46] people down through time that would be
[56:48] in position of leadership what they
[56:50] would do but ultimately he does not
[56:53] always stop and forbid people of the
[56:58] evil and darkness from being in a
[57:00] position of authority But ultimately
[57:03] when it comes to reigning with him in
[57:07] the future Kingdom he will control all
[57:12] who sets was him in his throne
[57:16] but before we will ever reign with him
[57:19] in eternal life now if you understand
[57:21] already that we are reigning right now
[57:25] in the Kingdom of Grace we are in the
[57:29] Kingdom of Grace and we have already a
[57:34] Dominion a position a place in Christ
[57:38] Jesus but God will judge and God will
[57:42] parallel the ability of those who will
[57:45] reign in the future Kingdom but they
[57:49] must also prove themselves a character
[57:52] which will be noteworthy now I know
[57:55] we're familiar with the church age book
[57:57] that power apart from character is
[58:01] satanic and we truly can testify of that
[58:04] all of us in one way or another
[58:07] so God will have a people that will have
[58:11] a power that had never be forgiven to
[58:14] any human being
[58:16] from myself I find that God makes it
[58:20] hard to be a king
[58:23] God makes it hard
[58:25] to be a leader God makes it very
[58:29] difficult to be a ruler of people I'm
[58:32] talking about God's people because he
[58:36] wants to search and find out the best
[58:39] that he can put before his people now
[58:43] every leader is not chosen necessarily
[58:46] by God but chosen by the people and we
[58:52] see Ahab whenever he was in his position
[58:55] he was a very reflection of the age of
[59:00] Israel we see the very first king King
[59:03] Saul and when you look at Saul's makeup
[59:06] and you wonder in your mind why would
[59:08] God ever choose a man like Saul but when
[59:12] you look at Saul where he was who he was
[59:15] and then you look at the end result of
[59:18] Saul you can see that Saul was a mirror
[59:22] of the age that he lived in he matched
[59:25] the people
[59:27] so to put David as the first king would
[59:31] have never matched the mindset of the
[59:33] people because the people were
[59:36] rebellious the people wanted a man to be
[59:40] their leader and what did God give them
[59:43] a stubborn hard-headed rebellious King
[59:48] he matched the people now I don't want
[59:51] to hurt your feelings first thing this
[59:53] morning but our president our Congress
[59:56] our Senate most of our leaders in this
[1:00:00] nation is a mirror image of the majority
[1:00:04] of Americans rebellious Liars thieves
[1:00:09] robbers Hellbound
[1:00:12] [Applause]
[1:00:14] good morning
[1:00:16] Hellbound now that don't match us that's
[1:00:19] not who we would choose to be our
[1:00:21] leaders is that right because we have a
[1:00:24] different taste a different desire so
[1:00:27] God and what I like to do for a few
[1:00:29] minutes this morning is parallel this
[1:00:32] and going into this about the right to
[1:00:35] reign with Christ Jesus and we know that
[1:00:39] this life truly is the shortest span of
[1:00:42] time that we'll ever live and we're
[1:00:44] making preparation now for the world
[1:00:47] that is to come and God will try us he
[1:00:51] will chasten us he will put us through
[1:00:54] all kinds of difficult things to send us
[1:00:59] down and thin down his crowd and show
[1:01:02] who his people really are now read with
[1:01:06] me if you would in Romans chapter 9
[1:01:07] verse 12 and keep this in mind now that
[1:01:11] we're talking about reigning that we
[1:01:13] have a right to reign so election will
[1:01:17] truly identified with a predestinated
[1:01:21] seed but there will be something in life
[1:01:23] that will show that we are fit to Reign
[1:01:27] now notice Paul he picks this up let not
[1:01:30] sin therefore reign in your mortal body
[1:01:35] now what you notice the first saying
[1:01:37] that Paul separates you from your body
[1:01:42] and he does not call you immortal but he
[1:01:47] calls your body mortal so he's speaking
[1:01:51] now to a category of people who have
[1:01:53] already entered in to immortality by the
[1:01:57] new birth these people have been changed
[1:02:00] by the power of God so he separates them
[1:02:04] from their self now notice how he speaks
[1:02:08] to us let not sin therefore reign in
[1:02:13] your mortal body so who's he speaking to
[1:02:15] he's not speaking to the body
[1:02:18] Romans 6 is not addressed to the body
[1:02:22] but it's addressed to you the Conqueror
[1:02:26] the born-again the redeemed The Immortal
[1:02:30] one now he's telling the immortal one
[1:02:33] how to treat the Mortal one listen let
[1:02:38] not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[1:02:42] body look at the word rain basilio it
[1:02:46] means to be king to exercise kingly
[1:02:50] power to Reign to exercise the highest
[1:02:56] influence to control so here Paul is
[1:03:00] telling the saints of God they have the
[1:03:03] ability to refuse to let sin be the king
[1:03:08] of their mortality now he cannot say
[1:03:12] this to an unregenerate person because
[1:03:15] their soul their spirit and their body
[1:03:18] is the Dominion of the devil but this is
[1:03:23] speaking to a person who lives in a
[1:03:26] divided Kingdom and the church said
[1:03:30] in the divided Kingdom you will be
[1:03:33] addressed separately so your soul will
[1:03:36] be spoken to and your body will be
[1:03:39] spoken to the king of who you are will
[1:03:44] be the dominant force of the Kingdom now
[1:03:48] sin will try to dominate even the saints
[1:03:52] of God notice everybody lay Assad or
[1:03:55] Angelic crowns and all of our wings and
[1:03:58] all of those holy ha and Shelly
[1:04:01] attitudes that we think we have and
[1:04:03] let's come right down to where the
[1:04:05] pavement meets the road meets the meets
[1:04:07] together the rubber tire hits it and
[1:04:09] wears and wears and wears and let's just
[1:04:12] look at ourselves in reality today that
[1:04:15] every one of us if you've been filled
[1:04:17] with the Holy Ghost for 40 years or 50
[1:04:19] or 60 or for five minutes you realize
[1:04:22] that there is a battle going on with you
[1:04:24] and that battle is between two kings a
[1:04:29] lot to preach that to you sometime A
[1:04:32] Tale of Two Kings because there is a
[1:04:36] great Warfare now the world of course
[1:04:38] will reject the king of preeminence they
[1:04:42] will reject the king of immortality and
[1:04:44] light so really this does not affect
[1:04:47] them but it affects those that have
[1:04:50] already been born again now notice he
[1:04:52] says let not sin therefore reign in your
[1:04:55] mortal body that ye should obey it
[1:05:02] in the lust thereof so you mean there is
[1:05:07] a way then that sin will try to get you
[1:05:11] and I to obey it but we're not we're not
[1:05:15] subject to that Kingdom no more no but
[1:05:18] your body still is it's a creature of
[1:05:21] time and your mouth will say Amen it's
[1:05:23] the greatest enemy you'll ever have in
[1:05:25] your life is yourself let not send
[1:05:28] therefore Reign be king in your mortal
[1:05:32] body that ye should obey again look at
[1:05:36] this word be obedient to to listen to
[1:05:39] hearken to a command to obey to submit
[1:05:43] to now notice again The Divided Kingdom
[1:05:46] so Paul is speaking then to those who
[1:05:50] are regenerate and testifying that they
[1:05:53] have a king in their soul but that their
[1:05:56] mortality is still under the basilio of
[1:06:00] Satan and he will try his best whether
[1:06:03] by sickness or sadness or depression or
[1:06:07] temper or anger or jealousy and so on
[1:06:09] and so on to bring you under the control
[1:06:13] of the flesh how many still fights that
[1:06:17] battle well I can say all the rest of it
[1:06:19] needs delivered of lying
[1:06:21] all right
[1:06:22] if you're born again you still fight
[1:06:24] that battle now notice that sin not
[1:06:27] therefore reigning your mortal body that
[1:06:30] ye should obey it so notice the
[1:06:32] difference between again the body and
[1:06:34] the Soul so the body even though the
[1:06:37] body is not born again the body will
[1:06:39] still try to pull you your emotions your
[1:06:42] infatuations the lusts of the flesh the
[1:06:44] lust of the eye the pride of life it
[1:06:47] will still try to pull you because
[1:06:48] there's another kingdom that Satan wants
[1:06:51] to establish within your mortality and
[1:06:55] it will pull on you until the day you
[1:06:57] die or the day you are changed question
[1:07:01] answer 64 the prophet likened it to a
[1:07:03] kookaburra that the heart was cut out of
[1:07:06] the cocoa bird and a wheat heart was put
[1:07:08] inside it and he said you'll have that
[1:07:10] carnal sticky nature that will bother
[1:07:12] you as long as you live and the church
[1:07:16] said but the good part about it is it
[1:07:19] bothers you but I want you to notice
[1:07:21] that Paul goes on to say that you should
[1:07:24] not obey this King inside of your
[1:07:27] mortality and what he tried to do in the
[1:07:31] lust thereof notice what the word lust
[1:07:34] is we're all talking about lust for this
[1:07:36] lust for that but notice what it means
[1:07:38] it's very very simple a desire a craving
[1:07:41] a longing for what is forbidden
[1:07:46] now a lot of times first thing we think
[1:07:49] about when we hear the word lust we
[1:07:52] think about sexual if that's all you
[1:07:54] think about oh my goodness you are
[1:07:56] missing so much of the enemy's tactics
[1:07:59] it's a lust or a desire for anything
[1:08:03] that God forbids us to have
[1:08:06] so God does not want his children to
[1:08:10] have temper tantrums
[1:08:13] so Satan will try to move on you to
[1:08:16] cause you to lust at your temper tantrum
[1:08:19] so you can give somebody a piece of your
[1:08:22] mind you're lusting for that which is
[1:08:25] forbidden
[1:08:27] well praise the Lord the Lord don't want
[1:08:30] any of his children to hold an
[1:08:32] unforgiving Spirit Well lust we'll try
[1:08:35] to get on you to lust after and say well
[1:08:38] I've got to write they've done this to
[1:08:40] me no you do not have a right you are to
[1:08:43] forgive even your enemies
[1:08:47] so remember keep this in mind now that
[1:08:50] lust is a craving or a desire for
[1:08:53] anything that is forbidden that's
[1:08:55] somebody else's wife that's somebody
[1:08:57] else's husband somebody else's property
[1:08:59] or if it's a preacher it may be somebody
[1:09:02] else's gift or somebody else's influence
[1:09:05] well I wish I could be like that man I
[1:09:07] wish I could be like that man I desire
[1:09:09] to be like that man if God never gave
[1:09:11] you that then you are lusting for
[1:09:13] something that is forbidden for you
[1:09:15] praise the Lord so sin then is
[1:09:19] represented as a king or a tyrant who
[1:09:24] wants to bring the power of the mind and
[1:09:27] the control of the Soul into his
[1:09:31] submission now for those who have the
[1:09:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan knows
[1:09:35] the token once applied to the soul he'll
[1:09:37] never be able to get that Soul again but
[1:09:39] if he can cause you to grieve the holy
[1:09:43] spirit that is in your soul he is so
[1:09:47] silent satisfied with just doing that so
[1:09:50] if he can use his kingdom that he tries
[1:09:53] to set up right here see tapes feel
[1:09:56] smelled hero imagination conscience
[1:09:58] memory all of that and he will try to
[1:10:00] bring them Gates and make you fall
[1:10:03] subject to that and then you do or say
[1:10:05] something you shouldn't do or say then
[1:10:08] you feel so grieved and the Holy Spirit
[1:10:10] is grieved away from you he is so happy
[1:10:14] Satan is whenever we will do something
[1:10:16] that will grieve him away from our life
[1:10:20] and then of course when we repent and
[1:10:22] say we're wrong and then we deal with
[1:10:24] the days or the weeks or the months of
[1:10:27] the aftermath of a terrible mistake how
[1:10:29] many knows how that feels a lot it feels
[1:10:32] absolutely awful to a child of God and
[1:10:35] if Satan cannot get into the soulna more
[1:10:37] than he simply changes the tactic but
[1:10:40] the Warfare is still ongoing so the king
[1:10:44] wants to dominate the mortality of our
[1:10:47] body and the mortality of our spirit now
[1:10:50] remember when you die the prophet tells
[1:10:51] us that your spirit breaks up when you
[1:10:54] die in eternity you will no longer have
[1:10:57] a human Spirit you will not have
[1:10:59] imagination you'll not have conscience
[1:11:01] you'll not have a human Spirit you said
[1:11:03] what will I have you will have a body
[1:11:05] you will have a theophany and you will
[1:11:08] have a gene seed which in your soul that
[1:11:11] was the original word image created
[1:11:13] after the Divine godhead you see God
[1:11:16] created you in the image of himself so
[1:11:20] what was he he was King God King Jesus
[1:11:23] king theophany so God become a man is
[1:11:27] that right and God also created himself
[1:11:30] osteophany so he wanted us to have a sea
[1:11:34] Gene a theophany and a body but now we
[1:11:37] roll around through time and we
[1:11:39] forfeited the ability to have a
[1:11:41] theophany living at us in this life so
[1:11:44] what did God give us as a substitute
[1:11:47] Earth until we leave this world a human
[1:11:50] spirit so in our human Spirit we go to
[1:11:53] imagining this brother don't like me
[1:11:55] that sister don't like me I've been
[1:11:57] noticing now what is that your
[1:11:59] imagination and your spirit and then
[1:12:01] your conscience where is it your spirit
[1:12:03] your memory the things you've done that
[1:12:05] was wrong where is it in your spirit you
[1:12:08] see once your spirit is taken from you
[1:12:10] and you get us theophany you'll never
[1:12:13] ever again remember one thing you ever
[1:12:16] done wrong but it's stored inside your
[1:12:19] human spirit so God takes care of that
[1:12:22] and just annihilates that spirit and
[1:12:24] gives you a theophany
[1:12:26] but God wants the kingdom to be so
[1:12:29] established in our hearts now that every
[1:12:32] day now if you can imagine it's like a
[1:12:35] great Castle now Carolina students
[1:12:37] Jerusalem four or five years ago and the
[1:12:39] City of course is not the original City
[1:12:40] but it was rebuilt during the times of
[1:12:42] the Ottoman powers and whenever you go
[1:12:45] say that they got the Damascus gate they
[1:12:47] got the lion gate they got the Zion gate
[1:12:48] they got the dungape they got all these
[1:12:50] different Gates and you'll go from one
[1:12:53] side to the other to the other and all
[1:12:55] of it comes right to the center of
[1:12:57] Jerusalem so the Damascus gate which is
[1:12:59] one of my favorites and when you come up
[1:13:01] through there and the gates are so
[1:13:03] narrow that you still cannot get a
[1:13:05] full-size car into those places so
[1:13:07] they'd build it like this and then turn
[1:13:09] it like this so it'd make it very hard
[1:13:12] for the enemy to get through the gate
[1:13:14] and they would also have slits up here
[1:13:16] on the top and they would have a place
[1:13:18] cut in the Rock and whenever you would
[1:13:20] come through if you made it through the
[1:13:22] first turn of the gate that have people
[1:13:24] above you with a welcoming sign that
[1:13:26] well welcoming sign was boiling hot
[1:13:29] water or boiling hot oil so by the time
[1:13:32] you realize it you're fried faster than
[1:13:34] a Kentucky Fried Chicken that's exactly
[1:13:37] right why because the gate is the
[1:13:39] weakness so when you come into the gate
[1:13:42] they want to try to stop you there what
[1:13:44] if you can imagine that you yourself
[1:13:46] have several Gates too and the basilio
[1:13:49] of your mortality is constantly hitting
[1:13:53] at that one gate which is the Gate of
[1:13:56] the Soul so he'll try to take your eyes
[1:13:58] and make them wander and roam to a place
[1:14:00] they should not be or your imagination
[1:14:02] of your spirit and what will happen is
[1:14:05] he will couple those Gates together so
[1:14:07] your eyes begin to wander in roam then
[1:14:10] he will make a connection between the
[1:14:12] eyes to the imagination and the spirit
[1:14:15] and then you begin to think oh how this
[1:14:17] would be and how that would be then
[1:14:19] he'll try to take another maybe it will
[1:14:21] be it will be touched so it'll take
[1:14:23] touch and then it will come back to
[1:14:25] memory and then all all these gates are
[1:14:27] connecting from the Flesh and the Soul
[1:14:29] remember you've got 10 against one
[1:14:32] you've got 10 Gates against that one
[1:14:35] this is why I say friend those who live
[1:14:38] in this life and overcome by the grace
[1:14:40] of God they will be a people that are
[1:14:43] fit to Reign so how will God give the
[1:14:47] land of the sins and the majority of
[1:14:48] them of course are going to heaven they
[1:14:50] think I know but all of them are going
[1:14:51] to walk down the streets of gold and
[1:14:53] live with angels and all that sort of
[1:14:55] thing and they can't even live a Godly
[1:14:57] enough life to overcome a habit they
[1:15:00] can't even live a Godly enough light to
[1:15:02] be able to live above sin in this world
[1:15:04] and they're going to rule and reign with
[1:15:06] Christ Jesus in the Millennium and be
[1:15:09] with him in the eighth day I hate to be
[1:15:11] the bearer of bad news but if you can't
[1:15:13] overcome the king here you won't reign
[1:15:16] with the King there
[1:15:18] notice Paul goes on to say in Romans 6
[1:15:21] 13 neither yield ye your members again
[1:15:25] notice how he's separating the people
[1:15:27] here neither yield ye so the ye and
[1:15:32] verse 13 is the same person that he was
[1:15:35] talking to in the other verse prior to
[1:15:37] this so the ye is not part of you which
[1:15:41] has reached immortality neither yield ye
[1:15:45] your members now they are your members
[1:15:47] but notice he does not call your members
[1:15:50] you but he calls in in a possessive term
[1:15:54] that they are yours they are yours and
[1:15:59] you have the ability by the grace of God
[1:16:02] to bring them under control and the
[1:16:05] Saints said but notice it will be
[1:16:08] totally up to you and I neither yield ye
[1:16:11] you notice he's not saying that the Holy
[1:16:13] Ghost will do this for you all you got
[1:16:15] to do is come to church once every now
[1:16:16] and then whether you feel like you need
[1:16:18] to or not read your Bible on the
[1:16:20] occasion you need to pray whatever you
[1:16:22] think you need to and of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:24] so take care of everything else I'm not
[1:16:26] sure what version you're reading that
[1:16:28] from but I burn it
[1:16:30] I said I burn it it ain't the Bible
[1:16:33] neither yield ye your members as
[1:16:39] instruments of unrighteousness
[1:16:42] is there any honest people here today
[1:16:44] that can say you've yielded your mouth
[1:16:45] your eyes your ears your fingers
[1:16:49] and your tongue
[1:16:52] come on now as members of
[1:16:55] unrighteousness now when you did that
[1:16:57] did that mean you were not born again
[1:17:01] does that mean you didn't have the Holy
[1:17:03] Ghost if you had the Holy Ghost before
[1:17:04] you still had it after you've done that
[1:17:06] dumb thing and we all still do those
[1:17:08] dumb things don't we but how was it then
[1:17:11] that it came about because ye yielded
[1:17:15] your mouse
[1:17:16] instead of sinking waiting praying this
[1:17:20] ain't right I shouldn't do that I'm I'm
[1:17:22] acting in haste I need to wait I need to
[1:17:24] pray and make sure this is the Lord and
[1:17:26] what do we do sometimes we do and
[1:17:28] sometimes we don't then we will allow
[1:17:31] from the control tower of the soul and
[1:17:34] we will allow the king and the basilio
[1:17:38] of our mortality and then we'll give
[1:17:41] somebody a piece of our mind I'll tell
[1:17:43] you the older I get the realize the more
[1:17:45] senile I'm getting anyway I figure I
[1:17:47] better keep every piece of my mind I've
[1:17:49] got because I'm going to need let me
[1:17:51] tell you young people you're going to
[1:17:53] find out you're going to need yours too
[1:17:55] but what does Satan do he will get us
[1:17:58] upset all been out of shape over this
[1:18:01] and that and the other and then we will
[1:18:04] yield our instruments
[1:18:08] notice he don't say your soul
[1:18:11] but you yields your members
[1:18:15] as instruments of unrighteousness Unto
[1:18:19] sin but
[1:18:21] yield yourselves unto God oh listen this
[1:18:26] as those
[1:18:28] that are alive from the dead
[1:18:33] praise be to God so we once were dead
[1:18:38] according to what he tells us in the
[1:18:39] book of Ephesians that we were dead but
[1:18:42] those of us who were dead he has now
[1:18:44] quickened us in Christ Jesus so we were
[1:18:49] dead but the soul has been quickened by
[1:18:51] the spirit of God and that puts a
[1:18:54] basilio inside the Throne of our heart
[1:18:57] our soul and that will allow him to
[1:19:01] control every one of these instruments
[1:19:04] right here
[1:19:05] so instead of getting on a website that
[1:19:08] you shouldn't get on there the king
[1:19:09] sends a control tower and the sensor
[1:19:12] comes up into your bank and say hey
[1:19:14] don't do that
[1:19:16] www don't you do that.com www
[1:19:20] god'swatching you.com come on Saints if
[1:19:24] we will stay in harmony with that then
[1:19:27] our instruments will constantly be
[1:19:29] yielded instead of picking up your phone
[1:19:31] to bless somebody else you pick up your
[1:19:34] phone and send them a text hey brother
[1:19:35] it was on my heart today I wanted you to
[1:19:38] know I love you I'm praying for it then
[1:19:40] you take the same phone you take the
[1:19:43] same thumbs you take the same fingers
[1:19:46] and you send a message of Faith and Hope
[1:19:50] and encouragement and uplifting and send
[1:19:53] a message of Discord and a message of
[1:19:56] confusion however somebody would
[1:19:58] preaching me you send a message and what
[1:20:02] do you do the king from your soul
[1:20:05] channels your instruments to be of
[1:20:08] service to the kingdom of God
[1:20:12] oh praise the Lord
[1:20:15] notice that as those that are alive from
[1:20:18] the dead and your members notice again
[1:20:21] it separates your members from the new
[1:20:23] birth
[1:20:24] he doesn't say your members are alive
[1:20:26] from the dead
[1:20:28] but you are and then he said you oh my
[1:20:32] that are alive from the dead and your
[1:20:34] members which have suffered from their
[1:20:36] life from the dead part as instruments
[1:20:39] of righteousness
[1:20:40] unto God
[1:20:43] verse 14 first sin
[1:20:46] shall not
[1:20:48] have dominion
[1:20:50] over you how many once that more than
[1:20:52] anything in this world
[1:20:55] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:20:59] look at this word dominion exercise
[1:21:01] lordship over to rule
[1:21:05] same word as the other if you'll notice
[1:21:07] exact same word that he uses in the
[1:21:10] other verse so sin will not be king
[1:21:14] over you
[1:21:16] he will be subject to the spirit of God
[1:21:20] notice now
[1:21:22] then there's definitely a kingdom
[1:21:25] that we must overcome
[1:21:28] to be a part of the Everlasting never
[1:21:32] failing never ending immutable kingdom
[1:21:36] of God read with me in Romans chapter 8
[1:21:39] verse 17 now let's go in the other
[1:21:41] direction and look at the Kingdom that
[1:21:44] we're longing for and if children that
[1:21:47] heirs Heirs of God John the air says
[1:21:49] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:21:52] we may be also glorified together why in
[1:21:56] the world would God link suffering
[1:21:59] what's glorification
[1:22:02] why would God want to identify suffering
[1:22:06] as a part of moving out of this realm
[1:22:10] into a higher realm why do we need to
[1:22:13] suffer
[1:22:14] why
[1:22:15] why is it so imperative that the people
[1:22:18] of God go through so many things whether
[1:22:22] it is sickness or depression or sadness
[1:22:25] or whatever it is or past but yet
[1:22:28] dealing with so many things
[1:22:32] I found this in studying this and I
[1:22:34] thought it was quite astounding
[1:22:35] statement that Martin Luther said Christ
[1:22:37] himself was not glorified
[1:22:41] till first crucified
[1:22:44] Christ himself was not glorified until
[1:22:49] first crucified
[1:22:52] is that right so we do not see the
[1:22:54] glorification of his Humanity first but
[1:22:57] what he allows us to see is the weakness
[1:23:00] of his humanity and then the
[1:23:02] glorification follows it notice in verse
[1:23:05] 18 Paul goes on to say in Romans 8 18. I
[1:23:09] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:23:11] present time are not worthy to come to
[1:23:14] be compared with the glory which shall
[1:23:18] be revealed in us I don't mind telling
[1:23:21] you sometimes that becomes a little bit
[1:23:24] harder to be able to get in your focus
[1:23:27] because the sufferings of this present
[1:23:30] time can be so difficult so harsh so
[1:23:35] drove so heavy to bear and you say Lord
[1:23:39] will it ever end God when is this trial
[1:23:42] going to pass God help us everywhere you
[1:23:46] look I know many of you live in your own
[1:23:48] little private world and you've got you
[1:23:50] and your father and mother and
[1:23:51] mother-in-law and father-in-law and you
[1:23:53] got a few cousins and a few aunts and
[1:23:54] uncles and you live in that little tiny
[1:23:56] World let me tell you something there's
[1:23:58] a world out there of our brothers and
[1:24:00] sisters I'm talking about around the
[1:24:02] nations of the earth it is believable
[1:24:05] the things that the body of Christ is
[1:24:08] going through around the world there's
[1:24:10] great advantages to our phones I thank
[1:24:13] God for them in that sense that yet the
[1:24:15] one downside is I hear from all over the
[1:24:18] world all over the world nearly every
[1:24:21] day just after the break of dawn the
[1:24:24] other morning I heard from Japan from
[1:24:27] Africa from India from the islands in
[1:24:30] the Pacific all over the world and to
[1:24:32] hear this need that need this trouble
[1:24:34] that trouble this going on that going on
[1:24:37] can it be a blessing yes it can be a
[1:24:40] blessing but with it comes more of a
[1:24:43] load this brother is facing this at the
[1:24:45] point of death this child just fell this
[1:24:48] young girl just fell out of a FedEx
[1:24:51] truck which happened a couple weeks ago
[1:24:52] riding with her father and died oh my
[1:24:56] goodness and this happened and that
[1:24:58] happened what does it do it brings more
[1:25:01] burdens to us those of you that are in
[1:25:03] contact with that you know what I'm
[1:25:05] saying and it can become so difficult
[1:25:08] and so heavy at times but yet do we not
[1:25:12] remember what he said in his word that
[1:25:14] Paul said bear ye one another's burdens
[1:25:17] and so fulfill the law of Christ so what
[1:25:22] is the law of Christ well it's not the
[1:25:24] Mosaic law it's not the law of the
[1:25:26] talmud or of the the rabbis but it was
[1:25:29] the law of Christ which was what not
[1:25:31] Thou shalt and thou shalt not but the
[1:25:34] law of love
[1:25:35] notice in the Sumerian Church age the
[1:25:38] Lord God Almighty says I know there he
[1:25:41] is walking in the midst of his people
[1:25:42] there he is the chief Shepherd of the
[1:25:45] flock but does he hold back the
[1:25:48] persecution
[1:25:49] does she stem the tribulation no he does
[1:25:53] not he simply notice it says I know your
[1:25:58] tribulation I am not at all unmindful of
[1:26:01] your suffering what a stumbling block
[1:26:04] this is to so many people like Israel
[1:26:07] they wonder if God really loves them how
[1:26:11] can God be just and loving if he stands
[1:26:15] by and watches his people suffer I dare
[1:26:18] say there's probably been the majority
[1:26:20] of us sitting here in this building
[1:26:21] today at some time or another wonder why
[1:26:24] don't God move all he'd have to do is
[1:26:27] just look your way and this would be
[1:26:30] gone and that would be gone he wouldn't
[1:26:32] even have to raise a finger he wouldn't
[1:26:35] even have to say a word all he'd have to
[1:26:37] do is look that way remember that's what
[1:26:39] the devil used against the prophet he
[1:26:41] said he wouldn't have to say one word
[1:26:43] all he'd have to do is look this way
[1:26:45] there's your wife's death that is your
[1:26:47] baby dead your diet daddy died two weeks
[1:26:50] ago your brother died your sister-in-law
[1:26:52] and he said he doesn't come too late to
[1:26:55] tell me there wasn't a God but what he
[1:26:57] was telling me was that he didn't love
[1:26:59] me well you know sometimes we can find
[1:27:02] ourselves in the same way why does God
[1:27:04] allow this to go on and let me tell you
[1:27:07] right now I don't know why God allows
[1:27:09] this to go on I'm not to go on but I
[1:27:12] know one thing my god is perfect I know
[1:27:15] one thing another thing my God makes no
[1:27:18] mistakes and when we pray if the Lord
[1:27:21] delays he has a reason in his delay and
[1:27:25] he don't always give us the reason but
[1:27:28] he just says trust me even when you
[1:27:31] don't understand believe me even when
[1:27:34] you cry and you pray and you're doing
[1:27:37] everything you know to do what should I
[1:27:40] do brother don't he stand therefore and
[1:27:43] gerd about yourself the armor of a child
[1:27:46] of God because he will move in his time
[1:27:51] and it'll be right on time
[1:27:57] oh my
[1:27:59] you see they could not figure out God's
[1:28:02] love
[1:28:03] they thought that love
[1:28:06] meant no suffering
[1:28:09] I'd say they ain't the only ones
[1:28:12] they thought that love meant a baby with
[1:28:16] parental care
[1:28:18] but God said that his love is elective
[1:28:21] love and the proof of his love is
[1:28:24] election that no matter what happened
[1:28:26] his love was proven truly by the fact
[1:28:30] that they were chosen unto salvation
[1:28:33] through the sanctification of the spirit
[1:28:35] and the belief of the truth he may
[1:28:37] commit you
[1:28:39] to death
[1:28:42] as he did Paul
[1:28:46] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:28:50] job
[1:28:51] listen now
[1:28:54] oh my goodness this is his
[1:28:59] prerogative
[1:29:01] how many all want to suffer
[1:29:07] how many of you wants to die in your 40s
[1:29:10] 30s 20s teens
[1:29:14] wow nobody
[1:29:17] but what if he chooses
[1:29:20] to commit one of us to death
[1:29:24] before our three score in 10.
[1:29:29] what if he in his own great counsel
[1:29:34] says I'm going to let this man this
[1:29:36] woman this boy this girl goes through
[1:29:38] horrendous sings
[1:29:40] but I know that
[1:29:42] I know them before the test ever comes
[1:29:45] when the test has passed they'll still
[1:29:48] be serving me
[1:29:49] they'll still be loving as a matter of
[1:29:51] fact their faith will be stronger than
[1:29:53] it ever was before
[1:29:55] now sometimes when he does such we look
[1:29:58] at him we're trying to ponder and
[1:29:59] understand God what especially if you're
[1:30:02] a parent if you're a parent and you see
[1:30:05] a child going through something you're
[1:30:06] saying you'd do anything and everything
[1:30:08] to keep them from going through this
[1:30:10] terrible terrible thing and then if
[1:30:12] we're not careful we'll try to judge God
[1:30:14] by that son of my God I would never let
[1:30:17] my boy go say that you're God how come
[1:30:20] you'll do it
[1:30:22] I call that the no-fly zone
[1:30:25] you better stay out of there you don't
[1:30:28] belong there you don't belong there the
[1:30:31] devil will go to creating doubt and
[1:30:34] questions and all kinds of things in
[1:30:36] your mind about the sovereignty of God
[1:30:39] so what do you do brother Donnie well
[1:30:41] you just tell him Lord I love you I
[1:30:43] trust you I'll do what job said if you
[1:30:46] slay me I'm still going to trust you if
[1:30:48] you take everything I've got I'm going
[1:30:50] to trust you I don't understand but I'm
[1:30:52] not saved by understanding I'm not going
[1:30:55] to take the Rapture by understanding I
[1:30:58] believe his word and he's right even
[1:31:02] when I think he ain't
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:09] now how many Ultra honest Christians do
[1:31:12] we have here today that would be honest
[1:31:14] and say there's been times I've already
[1:31:15] wondered about the Lord's way and I've
[1:31:26] oh my God
[1:31:28] this is his prerogative
[1:31:30] he is sovereign
[1:31:32] it is all
[1:31:34] with a purpose
[1:31:37] if he did not have a purpose and he
[1:31:39] would be the author of frustration and
[1:31:42] not a peace
[1:31:43] his purpose is after we have suffered a
[1:31:46] while we would be made perfect
[1:31:49] be established strengthened and settled
[1:31:52] as job says he put strength in US
[1:31:58] you see here he himself
[1:32:01] suffered
[1:32:02] he learned obedience by the things that
[1:32:06] he suffered he was actually made perfect
[1:32:09] this is mind-boggling
[1:32:12] made perfect
[1:32:15] by the things that he suffered and he
[1:32:17] quotes the scripture here in Romans
[1:32:18] Hebrew Hebrews rather though he were a
[1:32:21] son yet he learned obedience by the
[1:32:23] things which he suffered being made
[1:32:24] perfect he became the author of Eternal
[1:32:27] salvation into all them that obey him in
[1:32:30] very plain language the very character
[1:32:32] of Jesus
[1:32:34] was perfected
[1:32:37] by suffering
[1:32:41] now how many still wants to reign
[1:32:44] ah you'd rather just mop the floors I
[1:32:47] see now
[1:32:49] I figured we could minimize the amount
[1:32:51] of Thrones we'd need
[1:32:55] Throne Room won't be near as big will it
[1:32:57] huh
[1:32:59] oh my notice this
[1:33:02] Lord God
[1:33:04] in very plain language the very
[1:33:06] character of Jesus
[1:33:08] Jesus
[1:33:11] was perfected
[1:33:13] by suffering now notice he does not say
[1:33:16] the character of God
[1:33:20] but the character of Jesus which is who
[1:33:23] the humanity of God
[1:33:28] this is another one of those things that
[1:33:30] he laid aside his Splendor not just a
[1:33:32] robe of dignity in a great crown but he
[1:33:35] stepped out Beyond his own character
[1:33:38] and stepped into a character of
[1:33:41] mortality that was not perfect I know
[1:33:45] that's mind-boggling if he would have
[1:33:47] brought a perfect character to the Earth
[1:33:49] and he was the firstborn among many
[1:33:52] Brethren that you would have had to been
[1:33:54] born with your character when you got
[1:33:56] the new birth
[1:33:57] but he had to step Beyond his perfect
[1:34:00] character and allow himself to think
[1:34:04] thoughts human thoughts feel human
[1:34:08] Temptation have human weakness set
[1:34:11] outside of a city after he had raised a
[1:34:14] boy from the dead and sat out there and
[1:34:16] grown with a headache
[1:34:19] amen
[1:34:22] Lord God
[1:34:24] and according to Paul he has left his
[1:34:28] church
[1:34:29] a measure of suffering that they too
[1:34:33] by their faith in God while suffering
[1:34:36] for him
[1:34:37] would come to a place
[1:34:40] of perfection
[1:34:43] oh you said brother Donny I thought the
[1:34:45] blood of Jesus perfects us it does
[1:34:48] this is a different type of perfection
[1:34:50] this is completion
[1:34:52] teleos
[1:34:53] maturity completion the blood of Jesus
[1:34:57] makes your soul pure just as far as the
[1:35:01] prophet said yesterday he said when the
[1:35:03] Lord God looks at us through the blood
[1:35:04] he don't even see us he sees Jesus
[1:35:09] and here's his voice when you pray
[1:35:12] we can say what's all this stuff going
[1:35:14] on for your character look you don't
[1:35:16] take your cars with you when you go you
[1:35:19] don't take your homes you don't take
[1:35:21] your title we don't take our building
[1:35:22] what do we take with us the only thing
[1:35:24] we take is our character
[1:35:27] and our characters flowed our character
[1:35:31] is imperfect and even the word
[1:35:35] does not speak to my character and
[1:35:38] create it in the state of perfection
[1:35:43] but God chose one thing
[1:35:46] to perfect
[1:35:48] human
[1:35:49] character
[1:35:51] sovereign
[1:36:01] makes me wish I wasn't so flawed
[1:36:05] maybe it wouldn't take so long enough
[1:36:07] for those of you that don't have very
[1:36:08] many plot flaws you pray for all the
[1:36:09] rest of us old dirtbags will you
[1:36:12] and we'll pray for you that God removed
[1:36:14] them scales from your eyes and help you
[1:36:15] to see you're just as bad if not worse
[1:36:17] than we are
[1:36:18] this we can see we're in a shape you
[1:36:21] don't even think you are
[1:36:25] or God
[1:36:26] why did he want this
[1:36:29] then he quotes the scripture James one
[1:36:31] two to four we'll just script skip down
[1:36:33] through there my brother encountered all
[1:36:35] joy when you fall into diverse
[1:36:37] temptation
[1:36:38] and I've got to be honest there's times
[1:36:40] with you that I can do that and there's
[1:36:42] times I struggle with it
[1:36:45] how many struggles with it you counted
[1:36:47] all Joe well glory to God hallelujah why
[1:36:49] are you shouting about now got a new car
[1:36:51] got a new house no I've been tempted
[1:36:53] like everything I'll tell you what glory
[1:36:54] to God I think I'm about to have a spell
[1:36:56] whether I'm talking about Charles she
[1:36:58] sent him when he met the Lord and he was
[1:36:59] a preacher it was a lawyer real
[1:37:01] dignified and he said oh he said to some
[1:37:03] sisters someone said brother Charles you
[1:37:05] need the Holy Ghost he said I've got the
[1:37:06] Holy Ghost he said he went out one day
[1:37:08] to pray and he got out in the woods by
[1:37:10] himself and he hurt us a little limb of
[1:37:13] the same snap and he said he was right
[1:37:14] out from his office he jumped up wiped
[1:37:17] his clothes off he said Lord have mercy
[1:37:19] here I thought my boss had caught me
[1:37:22] praying and he said I I ain't got the
[1:37:24] Holy Ghost he stayed right Daniel he got
[1:37:26] the Holy Ghost and prayed through and
[1:37:28] the spirit of God come to hell and he
[1:37:30] said one day when he come back into
[1:37:31] preaching he took off run and wouldn't
[1:37:33] come to the back wall of the church and
[1:37:35] said Lord I'm going to bring reproach on
[1:37:37] you I got to stay back here until your
[1:37:39] blessing wears off that's the difference
[1:37:40] between a man that's drunk and a man
[1:37:42] that's just reading about drinking
[1:37:43] that's what a lot of our message folks
[1:37:45] are they read about the quotes but once
[1:37:47] you ever get so drunk on the Holy Ghost
[1:37:49] it will help you when you're down it'll
[1:37:52] help you when you're weary it'll help
[1:37:54] them when you don't understand it'll
[1:37:56] help you when you're questioned
[1:38:03] page 117 paragraph one why does he stand
[1:38:07] by
[1:38:10] the reason is Romans 8 17-18 then he
[1:38:13] reads the scripture that we've been
[1:38:14] reading
[1:38:16] unless we suffer with him
[1:38:19] we cannot reign
[1:38:21] with him you have to suffer
[1:38:24] to reign
[1:38:26] the reason for this is character
[1:38:29] is simply never made
[1:38:33] without suffering
[1:38:37] oh wow
[1:38:40] character is
[1:38:42] say it with me a
[1:38:46] Victory not
[1:38:49] a gift
[1:38:51] oh man
[1:38:53] I've been a whole lot better in tongues
[1:38:54] with it I've been a whole lot better in
[1:38:56] discernment and Visions my the Lord just
[1:38:59] said here you go here you go stand the
[1:39:00] line here everybody all right everybody
[1:39:01] come on stand in line here here's your
[1:39:03] character here's your character here's
[1:39:05] your seat the word of God praise the
[1:39:08] Lord
[1:39:08] well look at me now Hallelujah I'm
[1:39:12] Heavenly bread I am well read Holy Ghost
[1:39:15] feel fed I'm ready for their action man
[1:39:18] I'm ready for a song look out devil here
[1:39:20] I come boy praise God but instead we get
[1:39:23] the Holy Ghost and don't you anoint
[1:39:25] somebody until we go to church with we
[1:39:27] don't even like and they just crawl
[1:39:30] under our skin they crawl under our skin
[1:39:32] and bite us and they just boy they push
[1:39:34] all of our buttons some folks since
[1:39:36] they'll push it buttons they jerk your
[1:39:38] buttons out of focus they jerk your
[1:39:40] buttons out and rewire them and then
[1:39:42] when you push them the next time
[1:39:44] and you're trying to fail what in the
[1:39:46] world said what happened well I know who
[1:39:47] that was that was oh so and so he
[1:39:50] rewired my buttons y'all you know why
[1:39:52] and people say well I'm leaving that
[1:39:54] church they don't I don't get my way
[1:39:56] that's probably where you need to go oh
[1:39:59] come on somebody why God may use
[1:40:02] opposition to mold and shape our
[1:40:05] character
[1:40:07] mm-hmm
[1:40:13] a man
[1:40:15] without character
[1:40:17] can't
[1:40:20] listen
[1:40:22] can't
[1:40:23] impossible no way will not happen
[1:40:29] no
[1:40:30] not maybe perhaps well some will work it
[1:40:33] out a man or a woman without character
[1:40:35] cannot reign
[1:40:39] well what about jumping what about
[1:40:40] running what about healings and miracles
[1:40:42] he don't say healings
[1:40:44] character
[1:40:48] do you understand one day Divine Healing
[1:40:49] will stop
[1:40:51] you understand there'll be no faith in
[1:40:54] heaven
[1:40:57] there'll be no faith in heaven faith is
[1:41:00] only for mortality
[1:41:02] faith will not be needed in heaven faith
[1:41:06] will end
[1:41:07] in sight
[1:41:10] what you've believed and what you hoped
[1:41:12] and what you trusted you will see you
[1:41:14] will actually see it you will no longer
[1:41:16] need Faith there won't be no need of
[1:41:18] preachers
[1:41:19] they say well glory to God
[1:41:22] they'll all be there the Holy Ghost
[1:41:24] feelings anyway they just won't be
[1:41:25] preaching no more so oh I thought I was
[1:41:27] going to get away from preachers never
[1:41:29] never you're always going to have us oh
[1:41:32] I'll tell you one thing some of you a
[1:41:34] little dared I'll let you might as well
[1:41:35] get used to me because we're going to
[1:41:36] spend eternity together we are going to
[1:41:39] shout together we're going to praise God
[1:41:40] together we're going to worship together
[1:41:42] you ain't never getting rid of me I'll
[1:41:45] vote you out you might vote me out here
[1:41:47] but you can't vote me out up yonder they
[1:41:49] don't hold elections up there
[1:41:53] oh
[1:41:55] notice a man without character can't
[1:41:59] Reign because power
[1:42:01] apart from character
[1:42:03] is
[1:42:07] wow
[1:42:09] but Power with character is fit
[1:42:14] to rule
[1:42:16] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:42:20] throne
[1:42:21] sick of it not just eternal life that
[1:42:24] you're living around a city and you're
[1:42:25] drinking the water and walking on
[1:42:27] streets of gold he wants us to share his
[1:42:30] food who is this person
[1:42:33] who is this Mighty Elohim that would
[1:42:36] want Mortals to share his
[1:42:44] oh Lord
[1:42:48] on the same basis the same basis
[1:42:52] that he overcome and is set down in his
[1:42:54] father's throne
[1:42:56] then we have to overcome the setlist him
[1:42:58] and the little temporary suffering we go
[1:43:02] through now it's not worthy to be
[1:43:05] compared to the tremendous Glory that
[1:43:07] will be revealed in us when he comes
[1:43:11] oh what Treasures
[1:43:15] are laid up
[1:43:17] for those who are willing to enter into
[1:43:20] his kingdom
[1:43:21] through much
[1:43:24] tribulation
[1:43:26] friends can't just say why the majority
[1:43:28] of laodiceans will never even come close
[1:43:32] to this
[1:43:35] to them one of the greatest battles on
[1:43:37] Sunday morning
[1:43:39] it just gets so stressed out the ladies
[1:43:42] which mini skirt do I wear to church
[1:43:46] which high heels
[1:43:48] should I paint my eyes pink or blue I'm
[1:43:52] so stressed
[1:43:56] can you imagine taking a letter to send
[1:43:58] church member and put them under the
[1:43:59] strain of a bright life
[1:44:02] for one week
[1:44:05] take a denominational young person and
[1:44:07] put them under the stress that our young
[1:44:10] people deal with in a month's time
[1:44:11] they'd be more suicides there wouldn't
[1:44:13] be enough funeral homes in the
[1:44:15] Tri-Cities to bury them all
[1:44:18] don't think just that God allows his
[1:44:21] older people to suffer I use also suffer
[1:44:25] they suffer depression they suffer
[1:44:28] rejection they suffer all types of
[1:44:30] things but let me tell you something the
[1:44:32] Lord Jesus knew he would have some young
[1:44:35] daughters in this last day he would have
[1:44:37] some young men they would also stand
[1:44:40] there and overcome they would look hell
[1:44:43] in the face and say I Will Not Bow I
[1:44:48] will not bow to you Satan I'll not bow
[1:44:52] to luxury I'll not bow to Fashion I
[1:44:56] choose the word with the Lord's despised
[1:44:59] you
[1:45:03] are you in
[1:45:05] wow
[1:45:10] thinking not strange concerning
[1:45:12] concerning the fiery trials that ought
[1:45:15] to try you
[1:45:17] that is what Peter said it strains that
[1:45:19] God wants us to develop a christ-like
[1:45:21] character
[1:45:23] that comes through suffering
[1:45:25] no shall we all have Troublesome we're
[1:45:27] all tried and chasing the sons not but
[1:45:29] one goes through that listen Church
[1:45:32] the church
[1:45:34] that is not suffering
[1:45:37] is
[1:45:38] oma
[1:45:39] it's not being tried
[1:45:41] hasn't got it
[1:45:44] isn't
[1:45:45] of God
[1:45:53] oh I I hear this message says and
[1:45:55] they're always on the map they never
[1:45:56] have no battles I'd run from that place
[1:45:59] as fast as I could
[1:46:02] something ain't right
[1:46:04] come on don't sit down look at me funny
[1:46:06] I'm reading to you from the message of
[1:46:08] the hour and for church isn't being
[1:46:10] tried it's not of God
[1:46:15] wow
[1:46:17] can I have a few more minutes
[1:46:26] you know what I read these things
[1:46:28] I realize
[1:46:30] especially the last couple weeks I've
[1:46:31] been looking at this
[1:46:33] I can see why the world thinks we're a
[1:46:35] bunch of nuts
[1:46:36] second Corinthians 4 17.
[1:46:39] for our light
[1:46:41] affliction
[1:46:43] which is but for
[1:46:49] our light affliction
[1:46:53] is before
[1:46:55] a moment
[1:46:56] worketh for us are far more exceeding
[1:47:01] an eternal weight
[1:47:04] of Glory
[1:47:06] you say how could he say such a thing
[1:47:08] he's looking at the difference between
[1:47:10] the present and the future
[1:47:14] the present
[1:47:15] and the future
[1:47:17] the disparity of the issues
[1:47:20] that he went through had he focused on
[1:47:23] them alone this man would have been so
[1:47:25] down and so discouraged he probably
[1:47:27] wouldn't have known what to do
[1:47:29] but he said our light Affliction which
[1:47:32] is but for a moment he calls what he's
[1:47:35] been through all this time
[1:47:37] a light
[1:47:39] affliction
[1:47:41] and he says it only lasted but a moment
[1:47:45] I'm Gonna Last an hour
[1:47:49] come on somebody understand what I'm
[1:47:50] saying so you look back through the
[1:47:52] hardest thing you've ever been in your
[1:47:53] life and say well that wasn't but a
[1:47:54] moment said dear God I'm glad it wasn't
[1:47:56] today for a minute today I'd been there
[1:47:57] a long time ago
[1:47:59] but we cannot compare it in the way we
[1:48:03] measure time notice what he said in
[1:48:04] verse 18. while we look not at the
[1:48:06] things which are seen But at the things
[1:48:08] which are not seen for the things which
[1:48:10] are seen are temporal but the things
[1:48:13] which are not seen are eternal
[1:48:18] now let me share with you a little bit
[1:48:19] of his light afflictions which but
[1:48:24] before a moment
[1:48:26] second Corinthians 1 5 for as the
[1:48:29] sufferings of Christ abound in us so our
[1:48:31] consolation also aboundth my Christ and
[1:48:34] whether we be afflicted it is for your
[1:48:36] consolation and salvation which is
[1:48:38] effectual in the enduring of the same
[1:48:40] sufferings which we also suffer whether
[1:48:43] we be comforted it is for your
[1:48:45] consolation and salvation
[1:48:47] and our hope of you is steadfast knowing
[1:48:50] that is we are partakers of the
[1:48:53] suffering so shall we be also of the
[1:48:56] consolation for we would not brethren
[1:48:59] have you ignorant of our trouble which
[1:49:02] we came to us in Asia that we were
[1:49:05] pressed
[1:49:07] out of measure
[1:49:12] above strength
[1:49:16] in so much that we despaired even of
[1:49:20] life
[1:49:27] wow
[1:49:29] now what's amazing is Paul doesn't even
[1:49:31] tell us what this particular thing is
[1:49:33] brother Timothy that he was going
[1:49:34] through we don't even know
[1:49:35] he don't even call it the name well she
[1:49:37] went to meet us down this is whenever I
[1:49:38] sold in jail he don't even say but what
[1:49:41] he's emphasizing is what went on now not
[1:49:43] Otis he says which come to us in Asia
[1:49:45] that we were pressed look at the word be
[1:49:49] heavy
[1:49:50] be burdened to burdened way down
[1:49:53] depressed how many has ever been there
[1:49:57] you mean a church-aged messenger felt so
[1:50:01] weighted down and so loaded and under
[1:50:04] such depression
[1:50:07] oh my goodness
[1:50:09] my God out of measure
[1:50:12] this can't take it no more lord it's
[1:50:14] bigger than what I can do it's more than
[1:50:17] I can stand I'm pressed out
[1:50:21] of my measure
[1:50:23] this is totally unfair
[1:50:27] this burden belongs to brother Rob not
[1:50:29] me
[1:50:31] this burden should never be mine
[1:50:34] look at Paul
[1:50:37] above strength
[1:50:39] so he's pressed beyond what he should
[1:50:41] been bearing and he's about strength to
[1:50:43] burn this so heavy the load is so
[1:50:45] difficult I cannot bear this another day
[1:50:51] that we despaired even of life
[1:50:56] look at the word despaired
[1:50:59] to be at utterly at loss
[1:51:03] utterly destitute
[1:51:05] of measures
[1:51:07] or resources
[1:51:09] to renounce
[1:51:12] all hope
[1:51:15] there ain't even a hope left
[1:51:18] there's not even a resource
[1:51:24] but when it comes after that trial he
[1:51:25] tells us it wasn't before a moment
[1:51:29] imagine people get the Corinthian letter
[1:51:31] and everything I said would you please
[1:51:32] make up your mind would you please make
[1:51:33] up your mind I'm like you stretch this
[1:51:35] thing out and you emphasize all these
[1:51:37] Greek words and you use the heaviest
[1:51:38] Greek words in the Greek language the
[1:51:40] Bible emphasize are five different words
[1:51:42] used for all that and Paul shows all
[1:51:43] five of them which was the heaviest
[1:51:45] burden that could be borne by human
[1:51:46] being and then when it comes out of that
[1:51:48] body said glory to God it wasn't but for
[1:51:50] a moment well he said praise be to God
[1:51:52] I've got such Victory out of that can
[1:51:54] you imagine when it comes out of this
[1:51:55] that he looks back and said I learned
[1:51:58] something in that trial that I'd never
[1:52:00] learned before I got something out of
[1:52:02] that trauma that I've never seen before
[1:52:03] that God vanquished all of my strengths
[1:52:06] and God vanquished all of my ability
[1:52:08] I've always found I could boil and the
[1:52:10] devil come I quote that word I do this
[1:52:12] how the other Paul said I got to a place
[1:52:14] I couldn't even do that I vanquished all
[1:52:16] of my strength all of my stamina all of
[1:52:19] my ability and I thought there is no
[1:52:21] hope left and here he come Oh Glory my
[1:52:25] brother sister it's the darkest hour
[1:52:27] that Jesus comes along long
[1:52:35] God May and sometimes does
[1:52:39] exercise his servants with such stress
[1:52:42] and pressing them to their limit
[1:52:45] and they're maxed to their own natural
[1:52:48] strength
[1:52:50] is unable
[1:52:56] and they just realize
[1:52:59] I'm whipped
[1:53:04] okay
[1:53:07] that's it
[1:53:09] Oh you mean they're going to the world
[1:53:10] goodness no
[1:53:12] I just realized it's the end of themself
[1:53:16] which is the very thing he's wanting
[1:53:18] anyway
[1:53:19] because every one of us have too much of
[1:53:22] us
[1:53:23] we can always fall back on this and boy
[1:53:25] when we get down we can always fall back
[1:53:27] on that but whenever we face this we can
[1:53:29] always fall back on that well I hate to
[1:53:31] be the bearer of bad news but he's going
[1:53:32] to blow every one of your fallbacks out
[1:53:34] of the way he's going to blow every one
[1:53:36] of your strengths totally out of the way
[1:53:38] until you come to a spot to where you
[1:53:40] say Lord I can't even walk without you
[1:53:42] hold in my hand Lord I can't even hold
[1:53:44] my head up Lord I'm solo I don't know
[1:53:46] what to do I don't know what word to use
[1:53:48] I don't know what quote to use no more I
[1:53:51] don't know what scripture to use no more
[1:53:52] but I know my God is still in control
[1:53:55] he's up when I'm down he's well and I'm
[1:53:58] sick he is my father he is my healer he
[1:54:01] is my redeemer he will not let me go
[1:54:08] thank you
[1:54:17] notice this and I'll close
[1:54:20] look inverse and I
[1:54:22] but we had
[1:54:25] the sentence of death
[1:54:35] I just knew this is it
[1:54:38] I I'm not going to make it
[1:54:41] I'm gonna die
[1:54:43] we had the sentence of death
[1:54:45] and ourselves
[1:54:47] but listen here's the key
[1:54:49] that we should not trust
[1:54:52] in ourselves Glory
[1:54:57] I want you to notice how he says it's so
[1:54:59] peculiar but he's the son of Abraham
[1:55:03] that we should not trust in ourselves
[1:55:06] but in God
[1:55:08] which raised us the Dead
[1:55:13] so Paul looked at himself by the
[1:55:15] meverness I'm dead this is it now we
[1:55:18] don't know whether it was a magistrate
[1:55:19] we don't know what it was if there's
[1:55:21] going to feed him to the lines we don't
[1:55:22] have no clue what it was but Paul had
[1:55:24] come to the reality this is it
[1:55:27] I'm dead
[1:55:29] there's no way out of this situation
[1:55:33] and then he realized oh
[1:55:35] so that's why you did that
[1:55:38] so my strength will be totally gone
[1:55:42] and I would be like Abraham
[1:55:46] when Abraham's body was dead and Sarah's
[1:55:50] womb was dead but he believed God could
[1:55:53] raise the Dead
[1:55:55] and here Paul says about himself he said
[1:55:59] the sentence of death in ourselves that
[1:56:01] we should not trust in ourselves but in
[1:56:03] God
[1:56:04] which raisth the dead what did Paul
[1:56:07] experience
[1:56:09] out of this great trial out of this
[1:56:12] great trauma and he was down in the
[1:56:15] ashes
[1:56:16] oh
[1:56:18] I'm done
[1:56:22] I fought with a beast of Ephesus
[1:56:24] I've been through this I've been through
[1:56:26] that
[1:56:27] I'm not listen to this one
[1:56:30] I'm not making this is it
[1:56:33] so here he goes the ashes of humility
[1:56:38] but then the god of Abraham said rise up
[1:56:42] oh Phoenix
[1:56:45] Hallelujah
[1:56:46] Hallelujah
[1:56:49] rise up Phoenix
[1:56:53] and out of the ashes
[1:56:56] come a servant of God like Satan had
[1:56:59] never dealt with before
[1:57:01] he thought the other Paul was bad news
[1:57:03] hey this is a total different book right
[1:57:06] here this is a complete different Paul
[1:57:08] this is a complete different Joy this is
[1:57:11] a complete different dominant would not
[1:57:13] it be worth it if God has to bring us
[1:57:16] down to the absence and then God says
[1:57:19] Arise My Phoenix
[1:57:23] arise
[1:57:26] Hallelujah
[1:57:29] all right out of the ashes
[1:57:34] and you can rise and say
[1:57:37] I was dead
[1:57:41] but I'm alive
[1:57:45] there was no hope but he came there was
[1:57:48] no way out
[1:57:49] Oh Glory to God glory to God
[1:57:54] oh when the bride
[1:57:57] can arrive to this verse this is not
[1:58:00] quote Mark 16. and this is not quote say
[1:58:02] John 14 12. let's quote this one too
[1:58:06] then we are ready
[1:58:16] oh yeah
[1:58:18] but we had the sentence of death
[1:58:22] in ourselves
[1:58:25] you'll never live
[1:58:28] you're too far gone
[1:58:30] the cancer is advanced
[1:58:33] there's no way we can ever work on your
[1:58:34] heart we can't do this we can't do that
[1:58:37] I mean it's sitting right here in this
[1:58:39] building today had the sentence of death
[1:58:42] pronounced On You by a professional
[1:58:46] and he was telling you everything his
[1:58:47] chart said
[1:58:49] but God don't always follow their charts
[1:58:54] we've got another chart
[1:58:57] we've got another report
[1:59:00] it's Dr God
[1:59:07] what's that
[1:59:09] let me read this once more
[1:59:11] but we had the sentence of death in
[1:59:13] ourselves
[1:59:14] that we should not trust in ourselves
[1:59:18] but God in God
[1:59:21] which raises
[1:59:23] the debt
[1:59:27] tribulation was so violent
[1:59:31] it was so violent
[1:59:34] so overwhelming that he had no hope
[1:59:40] it was just like he thought
[1:59:42] this is it
[1:59:45] this is it
[1:59:48] but I love it even when Saints will get
[1:59:50] there and they look at it and think wow
[1:59:52] I don't know I don't know if I'm gonna
[1:59:54] put her this time or not
[1:59:57] but they still go back to what Martha
[1:59:59] said her man said even now Lord whatever
[2:00:02] you say
[2:00:05] whatever you say I don't reckon none of
[2:00:08] us share today's the bad dislasm to us
[2:00:10] are we
[2:00:11] in the all four days dead
[2:00:13] four days gone the spirit out there
[2:00:15] somewhere
[2:00:16] but she said even now whatever you ask
[2:00:18] God God will do it
[2:00:21] stand up and say the same thing
[2:00:24] I was he that was dead but I'm alive
[2:00:28] he may not allow you to physically die
[2:00:30] but just to where you'd feel like you're
[2:00:32] getting so low but really we are dying
[2:00:36] it's the dying of our confidence it's
[2:00:38] the dying of our strength and our self
[2:00:40] I used to know a preacher and Pentecost
[2:00:42] brother Paul
[2:00:44] Hebrews one of the greatest Bible
[2:00:46] quoting preachers I ever met in my life
[2:00:48] and I I really admired him
[2:00:51] but I happened to spend a little time
[2:00:54] with him one day
[2:00:55] over in Virginia
[2:00:58] and he told me the reason that he did
[2:01:00] that was
[2:01:01] if he'd gotten a hard spot in the
[2:01:03] service
[2:01:04] he just started quoting the Bible
[2:01:07] and he could quote it like a Gatling gun
[2:01:09] I mean chapter verse the whole thing it
[2:01:12] was just and I began to think of that
[2:01:14] and I thought so really that's his
[2:01:16] crutch
[2:01:17] his knowledge
[2:01:19] of being able to quote the word
[2:01:21] I wonder what our crutches are called
[2:01:23] today
[2:01:26] and wonder if he don't let us come down
[2:01:28] to the ash sheep remember that's where
[2:01:30] he brought job remember brother Brown
[2:01:32] preached on that ass sheep for about a
[2:01:33] year and a sister comes home and said
[2:01:35] brother Brandon when are you ever going
[2:01:37] to get job off that ass sheep
[2:01:39] well I guess that sister didn't know
[2:01:41] category according to the amount of time
[2:01:42] job was in that book about a year well
[2:01:45] the prophet was about right on his time
[2:01:46] what
[2:01:47] oh how many knows it sometimes you can
[2:01:50] get there and you look around there
[2:01:51] ain't no hope Here Comes Bill Dad Here
[2:01:53] Comes This friend you go to church with
[2:01:55] that friend your mom even calls you said
[2:01:57] if you picked out your casket yet if you
[2:01:58] got your shoes signed for your funeral
[2:02:00] boy there ain't no hope for you but if
[2:02:02] God is not done with you yet I don't
[2:02:04] care if the funeral partner is calling
[2:02:06] for you and say is he gone yet we don't
[2:02:08] got the casket ready because they got
[2:02:10] the embalming fluid ready if it ain't
[2:02:11] God's time you ain't going
[2:02:14] I said you ain't going because the devil
[2:02:17] didn't bring us here and the devil ain't
[2:02:19] going to take us away
[2:02:21] by the grace of God
[2:02:31] friends you know where they are don't
[2:02:33] you
[2:02:34] we're on the journey
[2:02:36] to the throne
[2:02:39] The Book of Psalms tells us about Joseph
[2:02:43] until his word came
[2:02:47] the word of the Lord
[2:02:50] Tried Him
[2:02:54] God had a word with Joseph's name on it
[2:02:58] and the word of the Lord Tried Him
[2:03:01] until his word came
[2:03:05] well maybe today is your delivery date
[2:03:08] maybe the word's been trying you
[2:03:11] maybe today maybe tomorrow maybe in the
[2:03:13] meeting oh I can't wait till the meeting
[2:03:14] why would you want to put it off for a
[2:03:16] four more days if today's your day I'd
[2:03:18] grab it
[2:03:19] I'd grab it right here
[2:03:21] it's the same Lord Jesus whether it's me
[2:03:23] preaching or whoever else is preaching
[2:03:25] it's not the preacher no way it's Jesus
[2:03:27] himself that we want to grab the whole
[2:03:29] top
[2:03:30] so one day Joseph's word came
[2:03:34] into the dungeon where he was
[2:03:37] what was he on that whole period of time
[2:03:40] what was he on a journey
[2:03:43] to the throne
[2:03:45] to have a character that he would be
[2:03:47] made right up next to pharaoh
[2:03:50] we realize when we leave this world
[2:03:52] whether by deaths or by Body Change we
[2:03:55] will not go to a character supplemental
[2:03:57] School
[2:03:58] we will go through a spiritual Purgatory
[2:04:01] that there will be supplied to us what
[2:04:04] we lacked when the bride leaves this
[2:04:06] world she will lack nothing
[2:04:11] you don't believe in miracles brother
[2:04:13] that is a miracle when we leave this
[2:04:15] work can you imagine there won't be one
[2:04:17] thing lacking in our life not one thing
[2:04:21] we will go straight from this hell
[2:04:24] into the paradise of God
[2:04:28] by 1965 and the prophet finished the
[2:04:30] church age book
[2:04:33] the streets had already been laid
[2:04:35] you give us a little update on the
[2:04:37] construction
[2:04:38] the streets had already been laid the
[2:04:41] gates had already been hung
[2:04:44] praise God
[2:04:46] and the Angels were standing there
[2:04:49] breathlessly
[2:04:51] awaiting for its inhabitants
[2:04:55] now if that was in 1965 and here we are
[2:04:58] in 2023 can you imagine which that's
[2:05:01] been a long time not according to God's
[2:05:03] time of day
[2:05:05] it's just been a few minutes
[2:05:07] so they've been sitting there just
[2:05:08] holding their breath a few minutes what
[2:05:10] are they waiting for us
[2:05:13] and we will fight all this hell and go
[2:05:15] through all this stuff and one day we'll
[2:05:17] get up and it'll feel like any other
[2:05:19] normal day
[2:05:21] probably the wraps shall be on Monday
[2:05:24] I mean one of the worst days of the year
[2:05:25] if I had somebody else thinking on
[2:05:26] Sunday so you'd be sharing church I will
[2:05:28] be in Christ that way you'll be ready
[2:05:30] Monday through Saturday
[2:05:33] one of the worst days there ever was
[2:05:34] ever thing on the world's going wrong
[2:05:36] and all of a sudden a sweep goes over
[2:05:39] you
[2:05:46] I've told it to you before but it's a
[2:05:47] dream I had years ago we was at the old
[2:05:49] church
[2:05:51] brother was living sin was sent another
[2:05:52] tearing us I turned the front talking to
[2:05:54] some different Brothers
[2:05:55] and this is Brother Buzz that I noticed
[2:05:58] and I watched it begin with his
[2:05:59] fingertips and he'd reached his hand out
[2:06:02] to shake hands with somebody and I
[2:06:03] washed his hand it just went
[2:06:06] and his hand disappeared and he just
[2:06:09] swept over him I noticed other people
[2:06:11] some of y'all was there
[2:06:14] some of y'all was there in the dream
[2:06:16] and I noticed
[2:06:18] you was disappearing and I looked done
[2:06:21] at myself like this
[2:06:23] and it started with my feet I don't care
[2:06:25] where it starts it can solder my nose my
[2:06:28] ears I don't care as long as it starts
[2:06:33] and I watched myself with my eyes and I
[2:06:35] just wow
[2:06:38] and I was enveloped into another body
[2:06:43] Oh Glory to God
[2:06:49] so no matter what we have to go through
[2:06:51] because of his glory
[2:06:53] his grace his Mercy
[2:06:56] it is a light affliction
[2:06:59] but for a moment
[2:07:02] misspearance
[2:07:14] the Lord
[2:07:17] and maybe I'd like to be remembered
[2:07:19] today before the Lord
[2:07:21] Prince he knows where you are
[2:07:25] you know it's what you're going through
[2:07:28] maybe some of you are so low you're even
[2:07:30] lower than ashes you know when ashes can
[2:07:33] actually go back to acids and gases
[2:07:36] maybe you're saying dear God I've never
[2:07:38] been so low in my life
[2:07:40] never been through so much in my life
[2:07:43] listen for the voice of God
[2:07:45] to call your Phoenix
[2:07:49] Hallelujah
[2:07:51] praise the Lord
[2:07:54] oh thank you Lord Jesus
[2:07:57] how many just by the raising of your
[2:07:59] hand to the Lord Jesus now
[2:08:01] say Lord
[2:08:03] pass by my way today
[2:08:06] maybe some of you so physically weak
[2:08:10] maybe some of you are spiritually awake
[2:08:12] that's just all you can do to get your
[2:08:14] hand up
[2:08:16] Hallelujah
[2:08:17] but the Donnie win I don't know when
[2:08:20] how I don't even know how
[2:08:23] but I know he will
[2:08:26] David said I've
[2:08:27] been young and now I'm old
[2:08:30] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[2:08:33] no his seed bacon bread
[2:08:36] David said yea though I walk to the
[2:08:38] valley
[2:08:38] of the shadow of death I will fear no
[2:08:41] evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[2:08:43] thy staff
[2:08:45] they comfort me
[2:08:49] wherever you are today friends
[2:08:52] he sees you young people he knows what
[2:08:56] you're going through
[2:08:58] moms dads he knows where you are
[2:09:04] Heavenly Father
[2:09:09] what a right
[2:09:11] given to us
[2:09:13] the right to reign
[2:09:18] how different the ride is from the price
[2:09:23] we don't go through any of these things
[2:09:25] to pay a price to be good enough
[2:09:29] price I'm talking about is getting rid
[2:09:31] of our flawed character
[2:09:34] our imperfections
[2:09:36] really in reality Lord
[2:09:39] your people wouldn't want it any other
[2:09:41] way
[2:09:43] why in the world would we want our way
[2:09:45] easy
[2:09:46] enough stand up there beside Paul
[2:09:49] Peter James John
[2:09:52] many of our fathers and grandfathers and
[2:09:55] grandmothers and the price they paid
[2:09:57] Lord the breaking of the century when
[2:09:59] the gifts come back and they were
[2:10:00] laughed at ridiculed made fun of for
[2:10:02] dancing in the spirit and all that
[2:10:06] and we want to go through this life and
[2:10:07] go through nothing no sir I don't
[2:10:11] I'm not the first in line When Trials
[2:10:13] come I'm not
[2:10:15] I'm not the first in line I'm in trouble
[2:10:17] scrub
[2:10:18] but neither will I stand over on the
[2:10:20] sideline and say if you don't mind
[2:10:22] pass me on by
[2:10:24] Lord God I I want to be a part of you
[2:10:28] and suffering is a part of Who You Are
[2:10:32] so I must suffer
[2:10:36] our suffering will be determined by you
[2:10:38] for some it'll be physical
[2:10:40] for others it may be psychological it
[2:10:42] may be reproach for the way the dress on
[2:10:44] their job
[2:10:45] it can be all sorts of things
[2:10:49] Lord for the god call man much of what
[2:10:51] they go through
[2:10:52] it's not for themself
[2:10:55] Decades of my life I've went through one
[2:10:57] thing after another after another
[2:11:00] and the majority of it has had nothing
[2:11:02] to do with me
[2:11:04] that has to do with your people
[2:11:06] I bear their fusses their arguments
[2:11:10] they're fighting
[2:11:12] I bear their indifferences
[2:11:15] I Bear all of that I didn't cause none
[2:11:18] of it
[2:11:19] not one thing and yet if I don't handle
[2:11:21] it the way they want me to they get mad
[2:11:23] as a hornet at me
[2:11:26] and I'm bearing that for who
[2:11:28] for you
[2:11:30] because if it's left up to me when you
[2:11:32] call me as an 18 year old boy
[2:11:35] I told you then
[2:11:36] and I tell you tonight there's a 66
[2:11:39] almost 67 year old man I can't preach I
[2:11:43] don't want to
[2:11:45] I don't know how
[2:11:47] please
[2:11:48] choose somebody else
[2:11:51] Lord the same with these people
[2:11:53] no doubt many of those burdens and their
[2:11:55] loads they would have never chose
[2:11:58] what they had to go for
[2:12:00] they would have never chose
[2:12:03] so hard and so difficult
[2:12:06] but it's your prerogative
[2:12:08] not ours
[2:12:10] so help us Lord Jesus
[2:12:14] oh Father May there be some births today
[2:12:17] I ain't talking about a new birth I'm
[2:12:20] talking about a conversion out of the
[2:12:22] ashes
[2:12:23] to where the will finally crumbles to a
[2:12:26] state of ultimate victory
[2:12:29] Hallelujah
[2:12:31] oh Jesus and our lives change our lives
[2:12:34] turn
[2:12:36] as the Phoenix we arise and spread our
[2:12:39] wings
[2:12:40] and sail into a realm with God where
[2:12:43] we've never been before

[2:24:19] been good to be in the house of the Lord
[2:24:21] remember the needs of our brothers and
[2:24:23] sisters I just have a little second
[2:24:24] going through various things of course
[2:24:25] that you're familiar with remember all
[2:24:27] that I'm sure many of you have heard
[2:24:29] brother Daryl whenever he will come up
[2:24:31] and pray and he won't mention every
[2:24:33] person on his prayer list but brother
[2:24:35] Daryl has quite a prayer list contacted
[2:24:38] from people around the world
[2:24:40] anyone not mention all of them by name
[2:24:42] whenever he's up here of course praying
[2:24:43] for us but he'll say Lord remember all
[2:24:46] those on our prayer list I was thinking
[2:24:48] about it yesterday and I thought you
[2:24:50] know I don't think that brother Daryl
[2:24:52] should be the only one that has one of
[2:24:54] those
[2:24:55] it probably good if all of us had one
[2:24:57] different Brothers different sisters and
[2:25:00] where you what I don't know what to pray
[2:25:01] for I can give you enough names to last
[2:25:03] you for about 40 days and 40 nights
[2:25:06] you need some help
[2:25:07] I think it'd be good for all of us well

[2:25:11] paper and pencil y'all still have paper
[2:25:13] and pencil all right you still have a
[2:25:15] phone where you can be able to put it on

[2:25:37] prayer line would go on with it ourself
[2:25:38] if need be but just pray for him that
[2:25:40] the Lord will be with him I know he'll
